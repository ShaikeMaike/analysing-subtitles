Well, thanks for the information.
I appreciate it.
There's no chance a mistake could've been made?
A misreading? Human error?
It happens.
Oh.
Well, that sort of rules that out, then, doesn't it?
So this really is a reality.
Mr. Secretary, your car.
Ah, yes. Thank you.
Eddie, let's take the parkway.
Okay, buddy. Final offer.
Non-negotiable.
For every buckle-down hour you give Algebra Two, you get two of quality time with
Nintendo and Sega.
Deal?
Heh. Just whatever you do, don't tell your mother.
Good. Now, put her back on.
Okay, hon. Number one son back on the straight and narrow.
Me? Fine. Just needed a little field trip to clear the head.
Bit of a nightmare day.
I'll see you in a bit.
You bet.
I love you, Liz.
This is a very dynamic game,
Mr. Depina.
You can be honest, Angela.
This game is as bloody as it gets.
But believe me, the kids will eat this up.
But first you gotta tell me what keeps crashing the damn thing.
Well, you have been virused, Mr. Depina, and a not so very nice one.
You are the best. I knew I could count on you. So, what should we do?
Well, don't think about hitting the escape key on any of your systems for a while.
One keystroke will wipe out your whole system.
I don't know how these things happen. I just ordered that security program last week.
What's it called?
Gatekeeper?
Well, that's what they all say.
Did you install it?
Absolutely.
The minute we got it.
I think.
Not to worry. Everything's under control. It's gonna be okay.
You're the best, Angela.
Now, do you think we'll be able to get this back in stores by week's end?
Absolutely.
Everything but the virus.
A friend of mine collects them.
I don't know, some people save string.
You are a genius, Angela.
I can't thank you enough.
Yeah, well, you might think differently once you get my bill from Cathedral.
Look, whatever it is, it's worth it.
Angela, I'd love to show you my appreciation,
take you out to dinner tonight, some drinks. Get you out of the house.
Oh, I'm very flattered and appreciative, but I...
You gotta eat.
Uh, it's... Unfortunately,
I already have dinner plans, so...
How about tomorrow?
The next day?
Um, these plans are kind of a standing arrangement, but I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Look, you're still the best, Angela.
I'll speak to you soon.
Thanks. Bye now.
Bye-bye.
Hello.
Large. Garlic?
Garlic.
Thank you.
No one leaves the house anymore.
No one has sex.
The Net is ultimate condom.
Come on.
Talk like that, Iceman, could lead to the eventual extinction of our species.
My sympathies exactly, Angel.
Let's have a date and procreate.
Not me. In two days,
I'm off on vacation.
Just me, the beach and a book.
I'm there, babe.
Look no further.
Sorry. Not my type.
I'm crushed. So, what do you want in a man?
Hmm.
Butch. Beautiful.
Brilliant.
Captain America meets Albert Schweitzer.
Spends all day dashing into fray while making world safe for democracy.
At night, playing Bach Cantatas while curing cancer.
Settle for a guy who puts the seat down?
Listen, Angel, you're dreaming.
You're one of us.
We accept you.
We accept her.
- You're one of us.
- One of us.
Yeah, I know.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful. I love Chopin.
You know this piece?
Well, I should.
You taught it to me.
Brought you something.
Just don't let the nurses eat it all this time.
My favorite.
How did you know?
Mm.
Do you wanna...
We could play together. Do you...
Now, I'm going on vacation for about a week to the Yucatán.
If for any reason you need to get in touch with me,
I don't know if they have phones there, but you can talk to one of the nurses and I'll...
You must be one of my students.
No, Mom, my name's Angela.
Can you bring me some candy when you come again?
My favorites are those...
Almond Rosa.
Yeah, I know what your favorites are.
Angela Bennett!
- Who is it?
- FedEx!
Thank you for using
Coming.
our reservation service.
Have a pleasant flight.
Hi.
Hi.
Line five, please.
Oh, I have another one going out.
Okay. Here you go, ma'am.
Thanks.
And here's your virus, Dale.
Can I use your pen?
Yeah, sure.
This is a nice place.
Thanks.
Have a nice day, ma'am. Bye-bye.
You too.
Mozart's ghost!
Thank you.
The hottest band on the Internet!
Cathedral Software.
Dale Hessman, please.
Please hold.
Hello.
Hi, it's Angela.
Angela?
FedEx Ship Software had you signing for that disk three minutes ago.
What took you so long?
Well, I was having way too much fun with this Mozart's Ghost.
By the way, I sent you a whopper of a virus for your hall of fame.
Just be a little careful with the escape button.
Look, here's the problem.
Pop yourself into concert information.
All right.
Houston Utilities. Um, Dale,
I think you took a wrong turn here.
Not quite Ticketmaster, is it?
See anything unusual?
Mmm, no. Looks like a normal web page to me, except for that little...
What is that? A little icon at the bottom of the screen?
Click on it, and then press control-shift.
My God.
So, what do you make of all this?
Simple.
It's a programing glitch.
Just a futzed keystroke that sends you to the wrong Internet address, that's all.
Last night it sent me to Amtrak's central mainframe and then the Mayo Clinic.
Neither of them are on the same subnet.
Angela, I've accessed a system
I shouldn't have.
If someone gets ahold of that disk, they'd have an awful lot of power.
So why don't you just crawl in there, find the program error and delete it?
Not quite ready to do that yet.
Look, what's your day like tomorrow?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm going on my first vacation in six years.
Just made my reservation and confirmed it. There are no refunds.
What time is your flight?
Twelve. But I have to pack.
I'm gonna be a complete madwoman, so why don't you just wait till I get back?
I don't think so.
Come on, why don't you just tell me what this is about?
Look, I'd rather not on the phone.
I can fly down tonight in my
Cessna, be there by breakfast.
We'd have five hours. Angela,
you know this shit better than anyone.
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
I'll see you at 7.
Great. Great. So they finally get to meet.
I'll be the, uh... The tall guy.
I'm gonna be the one with "spineless simp" tattooed to her forehead.
Bye.
Bye.
See you tomorrow.
Why do I do this?
Burbank tower,
Cessna 739 Mike Bravo.
Intercepting approach course
ILS, runway eight.
Three-nine
Mike Bravo, we've lost radar contact.
Say your position and altitude.
Just passing the middle marker at 1300 feet.
Three-nine Mike Bravo, that's a negative.
Verify your position and check your instruments.
All normal. You must be able to see my lights.
That's a negative. Execute a missed approach immediately.
Contact approach control on 124.5.
Okay, Burbank, but still, everything looks ok...
Shit! God!
Cathedral Software.
Hi. Russ Melbourne, please.
Yes, one moment, please.
Mozart's ghost!
Russ Melbourne here.
Hi, it's Angela.
Angela. I thought you'd be long gone.
No, I was actually getting ready to leave. That's why I'm calling.
Good. I'm glad you're still going, but when you get back, we need to talk.
We're really desperately short of your genius up here.
Oh, please. I am far from being a genius, Russ, especially with a room full of people looking over my shoulder.
We've talked about this before.
Listen, that's not the reason I called.
Just think about it, will you?
The honchos up here aren't going to let me pick up someone new to replace Dale on such short notice,
not with all the security breaches we've had in the past.
Replace Dale?
Okay.
What? You're kidding, right?
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd heard.
What? What happened?
Angela, Dale's dead. His plane crashed last night outside L.A.
He... I just talked to him yesterday.
He was... He was coming to see me.
Kind of puts things in perspective, doesn't it?
Well, let's talk when you get back, huh?
And, heh, try to have a good vacation.
Okay.
I'll talk to you soon, Russ.
Plenty of time, sis.
Plenty of time.
Ain't nothing coming in or going out for the last hour.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
We are sorry to announce there is a computer malfunction
and all flights have been canceled...
The whole airport is down.
As soon as we get further information, we will advise you.
Thank you very much.
We will let you all know.
I am sorry...
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We are doing the best we can.
Yeah. Okay.
...political circles that a blood test
taken last week at
Bethesda Naval Hospital
did in fact reveal that Under Secretary of Defense Mike Bergstrom
was infected with the AIDS virus.
Bergstrom, well known for his...
You okay?
Oh, yeah. It's just, you know, all these people. It's a little...
No, I meant, are you okay with your soda? Would you like a refill?
No, I'm fine.
I've had three already.
The computer malfunction has been repaired.
One more and I'll probably be able to fly myself to Mexico.
Looks like you won't have to.
Enjoy your flight.
Mozart's ghost!
Waiter.
I'd like a Gibson, please.
It's a martini with an onion instead of an olive.
Is that okay?
Thanks.
Excuse me. Could I have one too, please?
I'll take mine up at the bar.
Didn't think anybody else drank those anymore.
Well, I guess I'm not as unfashionable as I once thought I was.
Is that business or pleasure?
Is there a difference?
Not a great deal if you're a hacker.
That's a nice piece of hardware.
I assume you're in the business?
Isn't everybody?
Nope.
God, we're pathetic, aren't we?
Excuse me?
Well, we're here.
We're sitting on the most perfect beach in the world, and all we can think about is where...
Where can I hook up my modem?
Yeah, exactly.
Um...
I'm Jack Devlin.
Ange... Angela Bennett.
Angela?
Mm-hm.
Hi.
Uh-oh.
Ha, ha.
My most embarrassing secret.
You know Breakfast at Tiffany's?
Very well. it's... It's my favorite film.
Right.
I pretty much wore out my membership renting it, so...
You know what I'm talking about, then.
Yes, very much so.
When I was about 13,
I had this sort of... identity crisis.
I used to think
I was one of the characters.
You thought you were
Audrey Hepburn?
No, I used to think I was the cat.
The cat?
Mm-hm.
And I'd... I'd sit there, and I'd
Ha, ha.
Play out the last scene of the movie.
I'd just play it over and over again.
You know the last scene?
Yes, I know the last scene.
Out in the pouring rain, out in the alleyway, and I'm soaked to the bone and I'm scared.
And I'm... abandoned.
I'm alone.
That's it.
Would you have dinner with me tonight?
Come on.
It's your last night.
You know what?
I would...
I would actually really love to.
Great.
It's a company perk.
God, this is a company perk?
Yeah.
Some perk.
I think I got a calendar one year from Cathedral.
Where are you from?
Colorado? Yes, it has to be.
Um, eastern... Maybe it's the southeastern part of the state.
The teeming metropolis of La Junta, population 50.
La Junta?
Ha-ha-ha. That's pretty good.
Is my accent that strong after all these years?
No, it's just a trick I do.
Oh.
Why "after all these years"?
How long you been gone?
Oh, boy.
It seems like a lifetime.
Let's see. I was, uh...
I was 15, going on 10, and we moved from La Junta to San Jose,
Tulsa, um...
So your father got transferred a lot.
No, not really. No. He, um...
I don't know. You know, he just transferred out one day.
What?
What are you looking at?
You.
Me?
Computers are your life, aren't they?
Yes. Perfect hiding place.
Thanks.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay.
Picture of you.
No, I have one or two other interests, I'll have you know.
Oh, yes? Such as? What's your specialty in computers?
Oh, um, anything, pretty much. Beta testing, mostly, but pretty much anything.
That's way over my head,
I'm afraid.
No, no. I just... You just go into people's systems, you find their faults and you fix it, that's all.
What happens if they don't have any faults?
Don't believe I've met one yet.
You must be a bit cold.
Not really. Well, yeah.
A little bit. Heh.
Here.
What?
Well, it goes around here.
What are you doing?
Ha-ha-ha.
Better?
Want one?
Oh, God, I used to smoke those.
But you quit, right?
Mm-hm.
Well, I refuse to.
I reckon you gotta try a few things in life without a safety net or how else you gonna know you're alive?
Well, I...
I take my share of risks.
Uh-huh.
Um, I don't always floss.
I rip the tags off my pillows when they're new.
My kind of woman.
Yeah, well...
Pretty adventurous.
I don't know.
I mean, what did you have in mind?
Dare you risk it?
Oh, shit! My purse!
Fuck.
No, no! Don't!
- It's not worth getting killed over!
- Come back!
- You! Stop!
- Jack, don't! Come back here!
It's not here.
It's not in hotel.
I look everywhere.
Shit!
So I come here, I do like you say.
Whoosh, like magician.
Oh, yeah. You're the midget Houdini.
Jack?
Jack!
God, I had everything in that bag.
I had my passport.
I had my credit cards. I had...
- Ow!
- Sorry. Sorry.
Thanks for doing this.
Well, you're the one bleeding to death.
I am the one crying about my MasterCard.
I apologize for having been a jerk.
What do you mean?
I'm the jerk.
Only trying to impress you.
Well, for future reference, you should know that the living tend to interest me just a little more than the dead do.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I suppose that's quite healthy.
Mm.
Look, I suppose we ought to try and call up the Cancún police on the ship-to-shore.
Okay.
It's not working.
We'll have to head further out.
Well, you can head out to Morocco for all I care. It's beautiful out here.
How we doing?
Still no dice.
I'm just going down below.
I won't be a minute.
Maybe we didn't go out far enough.
No, this should do it.
Tonight's been so out of control, huh?
Yeah.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but this isn't exactly my style.
I thought you liked taking risks.
Well, yes, but I mean...
You know what I mean.
What?
You know, first date.
Yeah.
Sex. One-night stand. That sort of thing.
Oh, sex.
Yes, that sort of thing.
Ha-ha-ha.
You've always been a relationship kind of girl.
Absolutely.
Both times.
So when was the last time?
Um, 1933?
Oh, I see.
And who was he?
Your college boyfriend?
Yeah, I bet he was the...
He was the captain of the drinking team.
Wasn't ready for a relationship.
Ah, wish I had been that lucky.
No, it was, uh... it was my shrink, actually.
You know the story.
I thought I was lonely and he forgot he was married.
That's okay.
It didn't last very long.
Then my mom developed Alzheimer's around then, so it was really...
You know what?
I'll shut up right now.
I'm just gonna be quiet.
That's okay.
No, actually, I... It's me who doesn't want to hear it. Ahem.
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm rambling a little bit,
I think because
I'm a little nervous.
You want a drink?
Well, yes. That'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
So, what's this for?
It's, uh...
It's for shark fishing.
Shark fishing?
With a silencer?
Yeah.
You certainly seem to know your ordnance.
Colorado.
You grow up with guns.
Yeah.
So...
Who are you, Jack?
Heh.
Who am I? Who am I?
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm Captain goddamn America meets
Albert Schweitzer, that's who I am.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
It is. I remember.
It was, um... Butch, beautiful, brilliant.
Spends all day dashing into the fray, fists flying.
No, sorry, I don't know any organ cantatas. Was that it?
Yeah, and if you'll excuse me, it's time to make the world safe for democracy.
Where's the clip?
Give me that!
Bitch.
Okay. Help, somebody.
Somebody, I need help.
Somebody? Hello, somebody?
Please, somebody, I need help.
Somebody? Please?
Okay. All right, um, keys.
Keys. Okay, keys.
Okay.
Keys.
Okay, um...
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Shh, shh.
What? No. How did...
How did I get here?
How'd I get here?
A fisherman found you.
He brought you here.
You were very lucky they came by.
How long have I been here?
Three days.
Try not to talk too much, hm?
Oh, we found a man's wallet filled with pesos and a lot of U.S. dollars.
We tried to contact him.
No. No. No, he...
No, no, no. There was no luck finding this man.
There was a disk.
A green square. A plastic disk.
Ah, yes, yes.
The disk was ruined by the sun.
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
You relax now, hm?
Get well.
No, I... I'm...
In a few days...
I need...
Look at you now.
No. I need my clothes.
You haven't got the strength. Please.
How much do I owe you?
Please. You have to relax now.
No.
You have to rest. You need a few days.
I need my clothes.
I have to go.
I just need my clothes.
In national news, we go to WNN correspondent Daniel Schorr.
Hi, I need...
Wall Street panicked when stock prices appeared to tumble
at a rate reminiscent of the Black Tuesday crash.
Officials suspended trading when it became clear that the losses were fictitious
and caused by computer pranksters when obscene messages appeared...
I need my room key for 2806, please.
What is the name?
Angela Bennett.
Wall Street expects to open tomorrow
with its computers protected by Gregg Microsystems'
latest security program, aptly nicknamed the Gatekeeper.
What about that prank downtown?
Pranks? Short-sheeting someone's bed is a prank.
These praetorians could have done serious damage to our economy,
just as the actions recently at LAX.
No, I'm sorry. Angela Bennett checked out last Saturday night.
No. Sorry, you don't understand.
I'm Angela Bennett.
I'm standing right here.
I didn't check out.
No. I'm sorry, it's not on the computer.
Let me check one more thing.
On a lighter note, a drug raid in Detroit...
No Angela Bennett. She checked out last Saturday night.
No.
I didn't check out.
I would know if I checked out.
I didn't check out.
According to the computer, you checked out.
There's nothing
I can do for you, okay? I'm sorry.
Excuse me, sir?
Step in, sir, please.
That room is fine.
We'll take it.
That's for you.
Okay. This one.
Excuse me, ma'am.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Please dial your card number again now.
The card number you have just dialed is not valid.
Miss Marx?
Please dial your card number again now.
Ruth Marx?
Excuse me, are you Ruth Marx?
No.
You're not the woman who's here about a temporary visa?
No, I am here about a visa, but...
Is your social security number 915-30-1717?
You live at 407 Finley Avenue, Venice?
Yeah.
Well, then according to the computers of the California Department of
Motor Vehicles, you're Ruth Marx.
So, if that's who you are, you need to sign there and we'll issue your visa.
But I'm... I'm not, um...
You're not what?
Um... I'm not, uh, clear about something.
Without this, I can't get back into the United States, is that correct?
That's correct.
So... all I would have to do is just sign Ruth Marx and...
Right. There.
Okay, okay.
Think, think, think.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hey, where you running?
Don't run.
Take your time. Relax.
My name is Stan Whiteman,
Whiteman Realty.
Come on in, let me show you around.
You'll like it.
Oh, I definitely saw her move out.
Okay, when was this?
Three days ago.
Moving van, moving men, furniture.
No, no. I've been in Mexico for over a week now.
How could I be in L.A. selling my house at the same time?
It wasn't your house to sell!
It's not her! I'm telling you, it's not Angela Bennett!
Please, sir, calm down.
I am Angela Bennett!
Please.
The real Angela Bennett had the deed and the mortgage papers. Come on!
I got 20,000 in the computers over here.
I checked every record. It's not her!
Look, ma'am, it would help everything if you could produce some form of identification.
You know what?
I agree with you,
I agree with you. But as I have told you 1,000 times already today, that I had everything stolen in Cozumel.
Please. Ask her how she got across the border without a passport.
- I had a temporary issued.
- Do they do that?
I don't think they do that.
Oh, my God. This is ridiculous.
Here. Here it is. This is it. It's just that it's under a different name.
Why's that?
Because they think I'm not me.
Is this your signature?
Well, no. It's my handwriting, but I just signed the different name that they gave me.
It's a federal offense to forge a visa.
Oh, really? It is? And what is it to steal an entire house?
Yo, Mike. You wanna run this?
I'll be right back.
You know what? It's not gonna make any difference, because what they've done is they've screwed with my information and fingerprints.
Who's they?
I have no idea.
Where do you work?
Do you work around here?
Well, yeah, I work in my house, but, I mean, my office is in San Francisco,
but I've never been there.
But I work out of my house.
You don't know one person in a town you've lived in for four years who can vouch you're Angela Bennett?
Not a mother, a father?
My mother is not well.
My father is... No. No. I...
There's, uh... There's my therapist Alan Champion.
Your therapist?
My ex-therapist, all right?
Yeah, we've got a Ruth
Marx trying to run a scam at a house.
She's wanted for prostitution and narcotics. We're gonna bring her in.
Um, would you excuse me?
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm, uh, just gonna use...
Mrs. Raines, is she or isn't she?
She kept to herself, didn't talk to anybody.
Where's the girl?
She's...
Where's my phone?
Anybody seen my phone?
Excuse me, sir. Did you see a young woman running out of here?
No, sir. I haven't seen anyone.
Thanks.
Yeah?
What the hell happened, Devlin?
Don't worry.
We'll get hold of the disk
and we'll find whoever she's been speaking to.
Don't forget, she's out here on her own.
She's feeling pretty vulnerable.
We don't want another
Cozumel, Mr. Devlin.
She's your responsibility.
Deal with it.
Look, I said I 'd take care of her, all right?
Cathedral Software.
Russ Melbourne.
Mr. Melbourne is no longer with the company.
What do you mean?
May I connect you to someone who could help?
I've never... I've never dealt with anybody in Operations. I don't know anybody else.
Who may I connect you with?
Um...
Head of Security Systems. Look, just tell them that it's Angela Bennett.
Thank you. I'll put you through to Miss Bennett.
What? No.
I am Angela Bennett.
Hello?
Hello, this is Angela Bennett.
Who is this?
This is Angela Bennett. Hello?
This is someone that can help you.
Give us the disk, Angela.
You have the wrong person.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Angela. We're not offering an option here.
Just give us the disk, and we'll give you your life back.
I don't understand.
I don't have your disk.
I don't know what you mean.
Give us the disk, Angela.
What is it?
- What's the number?
Did you get the address?
It's 3100 California.
Hi, this is Dr. Alan
Champion. I can't come to the phone now
Oh, please be home.
So at the beep, please leave your name,
your number, la dee da.
You know the drill.
- Are you screening? Please be screening.
- Hello. Hello. I'm home.
Hi. It's me.
I need your help.
I'm in a lot of trouble.
Shit.
I'm not exactly sure what else you want me to do.
Look, hold on, hold on.
This is a cell phone, right?
Yeah. So, I mean, we can't put a normal trace on it.
No, listen.
There's no problem. No, no, no.
Just get the number.
Right.
But don't dial it.
Just send out a signal.
Send it from the base here?
Yeah.
Then find me two repeater cells that can pick it up.
Give me the bisect and it'll find it within a few hundred yards.
Okay.
Go.
Alan? Angie?
Go, go, go.
Nice to see you too.
I'm sorry. Just go.
Well, come on, I'm not a cab.
Say hi.
Hi. Can we go now?
Yeah. Now we can go.
Listen, you still have that laptop that I gave you?
Uh-huh. I'm wearing it.
I'm serious. Do you have it?
Yes, I have it.
Okay, we need to go get it, and then I need for you to take me to a hotel room.
Now, that, that's doable.
Alan, just go.
Just go. Go, go, go.
I swear to God. I asked for a quarter, she gave me a telephone.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm calling everybody.
Clever girl.
Voila'. Ouch. Ha, ha.
Alan, you don't have to...
To stay if you don't want to.
I'm sure that, um...
God, what's her name? Sorry.
Amy. Don't worry.
It's over with Amy.
I'm sorry.
Ha, ha.
Don't be, dearie.
We're not. This is...
This is bizarre.
I haven't seen you in so long.
What are we even doing here?
Um, I just figured you would be safe.
Oh, great.
So I've gone from being a self-centered asshole to safe.
Thank you very much.
No, I just figured that they couldn't trace me to you and that your... Your patient records are confidential, right?
My patient records.
Yeah, I knew I had my subtle charms.
It's just, you're the only person
I have to turn to right now, so...
And you know what, Angie?
I am gonna take that as a big, big compliment.
Guess what time it is.
Gibsons.
Almost. We have no onions, so we'll have to use these.
Seldane, the antihistamine of champions.
Heh. I could always make you laugh, couldn't I?
You know what? I'm gonna pass.
No drink?
No drink.
Hmm.
All right.
I come bearing gifts.
Some of Amy's clothes for you here. Try these on.
This is such a nightmare.
It's like I'm not even me anymore.
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.
Come on. Look at me.
You're freaking me.
You gotta take a breath, take a pause.
Okay, if you're not you, tell me who you think you are.
Christ, you're not even listening to me.
Oh, I am listening.
But come on, somebody stole your purse.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
Oh, come on. I do believe...
Yeah, that's not true.
You know what I believe?
I believe you're a very frightened woman.
I think in general, you're disconnected from the human race.
I think you're way out there on your own.
You mix in your father leaving...
Oh, no. No.
My father has nothing to do with the fact that my car's missing, has nothing to do with the fact that my house is empty, that the Los Angeles Police
Department is chasing after me and that somebody out there wants to kill me. No.
Now, I believe something happened, but that just doesn't make sense.
Oh.
I don't want to be simplistic here, but
I think you're just reaching out.
You know what? You're absolutely right. I am reaching out.
I'm reaching out to anybody who knows me, anybody who will listen to me and believe me, be my friend and somebody to trust...
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, Angie.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes it's easier for me to play doctor than it is to listen.
I just don't... I don't understand.
Why me? Why me?
I am nobody. I am nothing.
But they knew everything about me.
They knew what I ate, what I drank.
They knew what movies that I watched.
They knew what...
Where I was from.
They knew what cigarettes
I used to smoke.
And everything they did, they must have watched on the Internet. I don't know.
Watched my credit cards?
Our whole lives are on the computer, and they knew that I could be vanished.
They knew that nobody would care It's gonna be okay.
And it wouldn't matter.
It's gonna be okay.
It's going to be okay.
What can I do?
I need for you to take my morn and just put her anywhere.
I don't care where, just put her under a different name, because I don't know what these people are gonna do.
You can do that because you're a doctor?
Yeah, sure.
I can put your mom in the county sanitarium, say I want her there for observation. How's that?
That would mean a lot to me, because she's all I got left right now.
All that you have left?
Christ, Angie, they've really gotten into your head with this.
Well, come on, put yourself in my shoes.
I don't hear from you for a long time.
I get a phone call, this convoluted story. Come on.
I'm not buying the whole package, but I'll tell you what I can do.
I have a friend downtown in the federal building. His name's Ben Phillips.
He's an FBI agent. Why don't I...
No, no, no!
I've been running from the police ever since I got back in this country.
That's the last thing I need.
Well, that's great, Angela.
Why don't you just live the rest of your life in this hotel room, how's that?
Well, do you trust him?
Yeah. I used to hold his head over the toilet at frat parties.
Come on. I'm serious.
Do you trust him?
Yeah, I trust Ben. I do.
Okay.
Now let's formulate our plan.
I'm gonna go back to my place.
I'll figure out the best way to transfer your mom to the sanitarium.
Then I'll call Ben. If I get any information, I'll get back to you.
Okay.
Well, don't be so down.
Come here.
It's gonna be okay.
I'm on watch now.
You know, this would've never happened if you had stayed with me.
Hey, Alan?
Thank you for everything.
You're welcome.
You stay put, kiddo.
Okay.
Mm, merci.
Now prompt me, please.
Okay. You carried this around,
Devlin, because it was important.
Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Password.
Okay, password.
We're gonna try you.
No. okay. Well, you look familiar.
Let's try you again.
No, come on.
Okay. Five-three-four... Now.
Okay.
Bergstrom?
What?
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
- Someone's on.
Think it's our girl?
Whoever it is, is covering their tracks big time.
A dozen hops so far. A pop in Switzerland, a UNIX box in the University of Montana,
five different routers at Berkeley.
They know what they're doing.
How long will it take to track her?
Depending how much she's set up, how long she stays on,
15 minutes, half hour at the most.
Well, you call me the second you find her.
And that other matter, Mr. Devlin?
Oh, that's, um...
That's free of charge.
Thanks.
No.
Well...
Yes.
Praetorians?
Praetorians, praetorians.
What?
I need more information.
“Big bad wolf, cyber terrorists."
I need more information.
“LAX, Wall Street, Atlanta.
Extremely dangerous.
Don't mess with them."
They've already started messing with me.
“Meet in IRL. In private."
In real life.
No, no, no.
It's gotta be a public place.
Where it's safe, with a lot of people.
Like Santa Monica pier.
By... Where?
The Ferris Wheel.
- Any luck?
- 8833 Rosewood
in West Hollywood.
Remind me to buy you guys something nice.
Hello.
Hello?
Angie.
Angie, come on. Let me in.
I'm dying out here with this food.
Sorry.
Sorry. I thought... You know.
Forget it. Hi.
I figured you'd be hungry, so I stopped on the way over.
I got you your favorite, Chinese.
Um, it's your favorite. I never really cared for it, remember?
That's immaterial. I knew it was somebody's favorite.
How's my mom?
Mom is fine.
She's safely ensconced at the county sanitarium. Everything's good.
Great. Thank you.
Hey, listen, about the Chinese, let me make it up to you.
Why don't we go over to that
Greek restaurant we used to like?
I can't. I gotta go.
Really?
Why do you have to go? Every time I see you now, you're running away.
No, I'm not. There's just a guy from the Internet who might know something about what's going on.
Well, can I at least tell you about Ben
Phillips, the guy you wanted me to talk to?
I told him your story, and he said he wants to see you first thing in the morning.
Angie, can't you wait until...
Well, does he know about LAX and Wall Street and what happened in Atlanta?
Of course he knows what happened in
Atlanta. What did happen in Atlanta?
A couple of kids black-out part of a power grid and spell "Braves suck" from the air.
Is that a national emergency?
Christ, Alan, listen. Cyberbob figured it out, and he knows what he's doing.
Okay? If I don't talk to him now, it's gonna be too late.
Listen to you!
Cyberbob!
You're going to meet a guy named Cyberbob!
Have you ever even seen him?
I don't want you going alone.
- Why don't you come with me?
- Sure I will.
Now, where are we supposed to meet him?
Santa Monica pier.
Yeah?
Hi. Bob Fox?
These people are dangerous. They killed Dale because of what he knew.
Now they think
I have this program.
Angie, I'm with you on this.
Really, I am.
But first, somebody tries to kill you, now this guy Dale...
And they put somebody in my place at
Cathedral to get rid of any traces there.
Well, what I'm asking you is why would anybody want to do any of this?
Okay, they would want somebody in
Cathedral's mainframe in order to set traps and to overwrite any programs, just to make sure that this doesn't happen again, right?
Well, that would take weeks, and you cannot do that from the outside.
Do you remember that Internet number that I told you that Devlin guy had?
Well, I plugged it in, and next thing I know,
I'm staring at, like, the personal medical files of the Under Secretary of
Defense, Michael Bergstrom.
The guy who blew his head off.
Yeah.
And they said that a computer blood test told him he had AIDS, right?
Well, when they did the autopsy, there was no HIV found.
Well, who knows? Maybe when they do my autopsy,
I can finally prove that I'm not Ruth Marx.
You know, what's frightening me is I'm starting to think that you're not delusional.
You know what I need to do,
I need to get back to Cathedral,
I need to get on that Mozart's Ghost program because that's gotta be it.
That has to be it. They've got this echo system on their computers there where you can retrace all your keystrokes in case you made a mistake.
You... Are you all right?
Alan, what's the matter?
Pull over. Alan.
- You're scaring me! Come on!
- Pills.
- Talk to me. What?
- The pills.
What pills? What?
What are you talking about?
You know what, get over here.
We'll go to the hospital.
He'll be okay, isn't he?
Well, he's allergic to penicillin.
They have him intubated and pumped full of epinephrine.
I have no idea what you just said.
Look, he's going to be fine.
If you like, you can go see him now.
Um...
Yeah, I would like that.
Thank you.
Hi.
How do you feel?
I'm starving.
Yeah?
Well, the minute you get out,
I'll cook you the best microwave meal you've ever had.
How long are they gonna keep me here?
Um, I think just another day.
And will you be handling the outpatient care, nurse?
Well, do you mind?
Mm-mm.
Visions of sponge baths dance in my head.
I gotta go.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'm more worried about you.
I'll be fine.
Wish it was over, but I'll be fine.
I know.
Come here.
I wanna tell you something.
Come closer.
I've wanted to do that since yesterday.
Yeah, well, when you get better,
I might let you do it again.
Mm.
Do you still think I'm crazy?
Sure I do.
Always have.
Get your cotton candy here! 50 cents!
Cotton candy!
Great picture! Bye!
Hey! How you doing?
Howdy!
Everybody's a winner!
Everybody's a winner! Step right up!
Hey, honey, wanna dance?
Come on, give Benny a big hug!
Just get...
Come on back here!
I'm a great dancer! Look at my feet!
Knock the milk bottles down!
Look out! Aah.
Safer to stay right here.
Sorry, Bob couldn't make it.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, I hope this isn't how you greet all your old lovers.
That's not exactly the category that you fit into.
No?
I'm surprised you didn't kill me, then fuck me.
Listen. It was difficult, right?
Because I was attracted to you. I still am.
I'm genuinely attracted to you.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna genuinely attract half the Santa Monica Police Department if you don't let go of me now.
Yeah? I know you've been avoiding them since you ran out of that house.
Well, I'm sure they'd still be very interested in hearing how you crashed Dale Hessman's plane, how you tried to kill me.
I'm sure they'd love to hear about that.
You go ahead. You feel free. I'm sure they'd be happy to make your acquaintance.
Did you know that Ruth Marx has a criminal record?
For drugs, prostitution.
You've got quite a record.
Yeah, almost as good a record as Bergstrom has, huh?
What do you mean?
I know about Bergstrom's suicide.
And I know all about the praetorians too, so I'm sure they'd love to hear about that.
- One, two, three, four!
- Everybody has their button, and Bergstrom's just happened to be homophobia.
You just have to know people well enough to know which...
Which button to push.
I don't have your disk. If I had it, I would give it to you. I don't have it.
Okay.
It was ruined in Mexico.
It's okay.
But what we need now is what's up here, so you come with me.
I promise you, I promise you
I'll look after you. Come on.
See you later.
Hi! Excuse me!
I don't understand.
What do you want?
It's not about what I want.
It's about what my employers want.
So take a look around you.
Do you think things are working?
I don't think so.
They believe they can make things better.
What? By killing people?
I don't ask too many questions and I suggest you do the same.
Come on!
Let's dance! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
What are you... Don't push!
Hey, you jerk! Jeez!
Dr. Henry to I.C.U.
Dr. Henry to I.C.U.
Dr. Herb Fields, staff to ambulance bay.
Code blue, 151 west.
Code blue, 151 west.
Let's go ahead and defibrillate!
Everybody clear?
Three hundred. Let's go.
Let's go, everybody. Clear!
Okay, he's got no pulse. He's not responding. Get her out of here!
No! No. He's my friend.
He's my friend. He's my friend.
- Please help me!
- No! No! Let me go!
Let's go!
- Go ahead and hit him again! Clear!
- No! No! Let go of me!
Alan, no.
Get off of me!
Look, Mrs. Champion, I'm sorry.
We did everything we could.
I'm not Mrs. Champion.
There were complications.
Would you like me to call you a cab?
Look, you're very upset. Is there someone who can pick you up?
Ma'am.
Ma'am, would you like to talk with a counselor?
Ma'am, maybe you should just lie down for a while.
I don't understand. You said he was gonna be fine.
He was fine.
I know I did. I'm sorry. We think the insulin caused his blood pressure...
No, no, it was penicillin.
He was on penicillin.
No, Dr. Champion was being held for the treatment of diabetes.
- No. No. No.
- He went into insulin shock.
No. He was not a diabetic.
I'm afraid he was. I can pull up his files.
No, he wasn't diabetic!
I don't know how much longer it's gonna be.
Yeah.
All right, watch your step here.
Aw, man, I didn't do it!
Take it easy.
We're just...
Hello.
You've no idea what it does to me just hearing the sound of your voice.
No, don't hang up, Angela.
Please.
This is important.
If you would just take a step back from all of this, you'd...
You'd see that you and I, we're really not so very different.
We're both loners.
We're both isolated.
We're both really untrusting.
We're both looking for the same clarity.
You've come to mean a great deal to me.
Yeah, well, you mean shit to me.
Look, I have to admit an arrogance in my perceptions of you.
You see, I've come to visit a friend of mine, an old piano teacher friend of mine.
You leave my mother alone.
Well, it seems I have no choice.
She's been moved by Dr. Champion.
The late Dr. Champion.
Shit.
Driver, this is the highway patrol.
Reduce speed, carefully pull over to the side of the highway and turn off your engine.
God!
Now, there it is!
There.
There she is! Police!
Stop!
Unh. Stop!
My name is Angela Bennett.
I am Angela...
My name...
- Freeze!
- Police!
My name's Angela Bennett.
Get down! Get down! Get your hands around back.
Around the back!
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have that attorney present during questioning.
Look. I wanna help you.
I've been appointed to help you, but everything you're saying is just so farfetched.
They've changed your name, your friend's medical records, crashed planes, because...
Just think about it.
Just think about it.
Our whole world is sitting there on a computer.
It's in the computer. Everything.
Your DMV records, your social security, your credit cards, your medical history, it's all right there.
Everyone is stored, and there's like this little electronic shadow on each and every one of us that's just begging for somebody to screw with.
And you know what?
They've done it to me, and you know what?
They're gonna do it to you.
Look, Miss Marx...
Um...
I'm not Ruth Marx, okay?
They invented her.
They put her on your computer with my thumbprint.
I hate to tell you this, but the
California criminal justice computers, all of them, have been protected by the Gatekeeper security programs for the last six months, so nothing that you're describing could possibly happen.
Oh, my God.
It's the program, then.
It's the Gatekeeper program.
It's got... It has a flaw.
If they changed my identity and it has a flaw, then the praetorians know this.
Then that solves it.
Yeah. Think about it.
No. You want to tell me again how you ended up in a stolen car?
Okay. Okay, listen to me.
It's like...
It's like a Trojan horse, this thing.
The praetorians, they hack into computers and they cause this chaos.
Um, LAX. Uh, Wall Street.
Um, the Department of Water and Power in Atlanta.
They do this so the people, they go out and they buy this program.
They buy this program and they get a false sense of security, only to find out that they've unwittingly allowed the praetorians free and exclusive access to the system. Do you get it?
Imagine what they can do with this power. They could do anything.
This is absolutely fascinating,
Ms. Marx.
Please. My name is Bennett.
Write it down if you want.
It's Bennett.
B-E-N-N-E-T-T. Bennett.
I have no reason to make any of this up.
As your court-appointed attorney,
I'm obligated to do what you wish, so I will call you "Cleopatra,
Queen of the Nile" if you want.
But take some advice.
If you go before the judge with this craziness,
I guarantee you will be found incompetent to stand trial, and they will hold you indefinitely.
Hi.
Yeah, this is her daughter.
Hi, Mom.
It's me.
How are you doing?
You doing okay?
Yeah? How's that new nurse treating... Is she...
Um, uh... It's Angela, Mom.
Uh, it's Angela.
Mom, listen. Um...
I need you to do something for me.
Um, there's a lady here that I need for you...
She's gonna get on the phone, and I need for you to tell her that she's...
That I'm me, okay?
Because she doesn't believe me.
Can you tell her that, Mom?
Mom, don't. No.
Are you there?
I just want you to know that I love you and...
Lady.
What?
What?
Would somebody answer the damn phone?
Here she is.
Who's come to get me? Can you just...
Special agent Ben Phillips, FBI.
I'm Alan's friend.
It's a terrible thing, what happened to him.
I'm... I'm so glad that you're here. I...
Angela, two seconds after Alan told me your story, half the agents in the Computer Crimes Division hit the bricks chasing this down, most of them beating every bush from here to eternity trying to find you.
Sorry it ended up being in a place like this.
Yeah, me too.
Let's get out of here, get you someplace safe.
We've got a field office about 40 minutes from here.
Okay, and then what do we do?
Oh, then I'm going fishing.
A shark named Jack Devlin.
Ring any bells?
Yeah.
He's their one-man dirty-duty squad. Smart, efficient, lethal.
Moral conscience of a chain saw.
Hm.
Scary a son of a bitch as he is, the guys behind the keyboards, they're worse.
The praetorians.
Our first good lead. We've been chasing them for years.
Look, we have to move like ASAP here, so I want you to start sketching me a quick background, all right?
Okay. Um...
Like, uh, for instance, how the hell did you access their system in the first place?
I didn't. A programmer at Cathedral sent the disk to me.
Goddamn disk. That's what kick-started all this, huh?
Angie. Angie, tell me.
Did you make a copy of the disk?
I mean, before it was ruined in Mexico.
Huh?
No.
Oh, damn.
Disk is only hope we have of catching these bastards.
Did you talk to anyone, give copies of the disk to anyone?
You guys are amazing sons of bitches.
Excuse me?
Amazing. Amazing, amazing.
Huh?
How'd you know it was ruined?
How'd you know it was ruined?
I only told Devlin it was ruined.
How'd you know it was ruined? Huh?
What's your name? You're not even with the FBI. It doesn't even matter.
Ever since I touched that disk, I've been running from one nightmare to the next.
You know what? I'm tired. I am out of it. I'm so out of it. I'm tired.
Hey! What are you doing?
Come on, get off the gas!
Let go! You're gonna kill us!
You'll kill us both!
Let go!
My seat belt!
On a serious note,
after what has appeared to be a month of playful but costly computer tampering,
an incident today has taken a darker turn.
We go live to Dermot Conley in Chicago with that report.
Police were called in as the recent comedy of computer errors
turned ugly today when six of Chicago's major banks were forced to shut their doors
due to massive computer tampering,
bringing the economic life of this city to a halt.
As you can see, it's a desperate situation.
Essential city services will be conducted
through the one local bank unaffected by the glitches.
That bank, National Fidelity, sources say,
was protected by Gregg Systems' aptly named Gatekeeper program.
Reporting live from Chicago's loop, Dermot Conley.
Thank you, Dermot.
In related news, Jeff Gregg,
billionaire founder of Gregg Systems, was in Washington for today's announcement
by newly appointed Under Secretary of Defense Calvin Shoemaker
that the Pentagon will be outfitting
the entire federal government with
Gregg's touted Gatekeeper program.
You need to remember, in this day and age, information is sacred.
Information is power,
and society must protect that at all costs from these terrorists.
Ironically, today's announcement came
just two weeks to the day of the recent suicide death of
Shoemaker's predecessor,
Michael Bergstrom,
a vocal opponent of the Gatekeeper program.
In local news, a spectacular car crash leaves one unidentified man dead.
We go live to Lynn Blades at the scene of the crash. Lynn.
Thank you, Elaine. Now, lam just yards away from where the body was found
with a gangland-style gunshot wound to the head.
Police are searching for the passenger of that car,
a young woman in her '20s, brunette, going under the name of Ruth Marx
and believed to be wanted on federal charges of car theft. Little else is known...
All Cathedral employees,
this is a reminder that the Cathedral booth
at the Moscone Center is in the northwest corner of the convention hall.
All Cathedral employees, this is a reminder that the Cathedral booth
in the Moscone Center is in the northwest corner of the convention hall.
Okay. All right.
Mozart's ghost!
The hottest band...
Oh. Don't do this to me. Do not do this to me. I am Angela Bennett.
Me. Okay.
Okay. Where are you?
Cathedral software.
Yeah. Angela Bennett, please.
Programing.
Angela Bennett. Hello.
Hello?
Who the hell is this?
Hello. Look, you got something to say? Otherwise...
Don't hang up.
Angela?
All right, Miss Bennett, now that I know where you are, let's see if we can get you away from your machine.
Hm.
How about I start a little fire, right here?
This is a fire alarm.
Please proceed to the nearest emergency exit.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.
- Angela.
- What?
Who are you? Our lady of asbestos?
There's a goddamn fire in the building.
Yeah, yeah. Just a sec.
Don't give me "a sec."
Let's go.
Hang on.
Now! Come on!
Okay.
Mozart's ghost!
The hottest band on the Internet!
About time.
Oh, the password.
Password nairot... Nairot...
Where are you?
We're not going back!
If there's a fire, where's the smoke?
There's no smoke.
We're looking into it, ma'am.
Okay, what's this? "Terminate all
Mozart's Ghost files now. Terminate..."
Oh. Gotcha, don't I?
Okay, now, who is praetorian?
Okay. Okay.
Okay, let's search you out.
- It's Gregg.
- Attention, employees.
Okay.
Please return to your workstations.
The fire department has advised us that this was a false alarm.
Attention, all Cathedral employees.
- Return to your workstations.
- All clear!
The fire department has advised us that this was a false alarm.
Subnet 345.
Come on.
Okay, where are you?
There you go.
Come on. Come on.
Attention, all Cathedral employees.
Please return to your workstations.
The fire department has advised us that this was a false alarm.
Attention, all Cathedral employees.
Please return to your workstations.
So you did do this, didn't you?
This was a false alarm.
Come on.
You gotta go to the john too, huh?
Disk, disk. Where are you?
Where are your disks?
Virus. Thank you, Dale.
Okay.
Save.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on.
Save. Come on, come on.
Yes.
Thank you.
You're going to the convention.
Oh, my God.
Security.
Had a break-in on the fifth floor of Cathedral.
You're looking for a female, about 5'7", brunette.
Did you see a brunette?
Did she come by here?
Sorry, ma'am.
Nobody came by here.
Only people coming and going around here are firemen.
Devlin.
Where is she?
She's gotta be with the firemen.
We have to find her now.
She's copied the disk.
Well, how the hell did that happen?
You were supposed to get rid of everything.
And you were supposed to have put a bullet in her head a week ago.
She should never have been alive to make that copy.
Heh. Smart.
Better call Gregg.
She's gone to the Moscone Center!
Jesus, she could be anywhere.
Are you sure she's out there?
She's out there, all right.
And she won't be hiding in some corner.
She came here to use a computer.
Get away from the computer.
What did you think you were trying to do?
Save the world?
No, not the world. Just myself.
Oh.
Well, I'm afraid it's too late for that.
The offer's been withdrawn.
You might wanna look at the screen, because everything on that disk was just sent to the FBI.
Everything.
So?
So, proof that the Gatekeeper program has a back door.
My. my.
Proof that Bergstrom and Dale's murder were orchestrated by Gregg.
Watch her.
The beauty of the Gatekeeper system is that we can get in and out of the FBI like it's the public library.
It's a beautiful system.
Let's finish the work and get the hell out of here. These people make me nervous.
No harm done. Everything you've done will be wiped out by just escaping the system.
Really?
Goddamn it, you're in the mainframe.
It's eating through Gregg's entire system, Devlin. Do something.
It's a virus eating through Gatekeeper.
Shit!
There's gonna be nothing left. Everything will be destroyed.
Take the far side!
Angela, stop!
Angela!
Shit.
Angela.
Angela?
It's just you and me now.
Do you realize you've changed everything?
Yeah.
One little stroke of the key and you've wiped out my employer.
You've canceled my contract.
You've reversed everything they've done to you, taken back your life.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Angela?
I knew you'd do the right thing.
This is the latest virus checker.
It's in this machine?
It's not responding to anything.
Try a new password.
Excuse me, uh, miss.
I can't remember what you told me to plant.
You know what? Why don't I come outside and help you?
... surrounding
Gregg Microsystems.
The law caught up with billionaire Jeff Gregg today
as FBI agents escorted him from his exclusive New York penthouse.
Gregg will be arraigned tomorrow on nine counts of conspiracy, fraud
and complicity in the death of Under
Secretary of Defense Michael Bergstrom.
An FBI spokesperson attributes the surprising arrest
to a transmission sent over the Internet by an Angela Bennett,
a program systems analyst from Los Angeles.
In other news, San Francisco police are investigating
two mysterious deaths at the
Pan Pacific Computer Convention.
A young woman found shot to death in a back-room area
has been identified as 28-year-old Ruth Marx.
The other deceased, a male in his 30s, is as yet unidentified.
Turning now to weather, the forecast for the coming weekend
is bright and sunny with patchy early-morning clouds.
It seems like summer is finally here.
We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin.
90 miles and counting-- that's how far officers-- of the Nevada highway patrol have pursued the blue car on your screen.
In a wild chase right through the heart of Elko at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour.
Live on the scene in Carlin is
Chuck Pickering in the Fox 11 news chopper.
Chuck, what can you tell us?
Benjamin, we're heading west following route 766, where it feeds off the I-80.
Now, just under an hour ago, troopers attempted to pull over the blue car-- which we understand is stolen.
That occurred on the 80, east of Wells.
Now, since then, this driver has stopped for nothing and nobody.
Any word yet on who the driver is?
None at this time.
What we do think, though and what we've passed on to the Highway Patrol-- is that from our vantage point we've seen another person in that car.
See, right there.
A hand.
It just moved.
See, in the back seat?
Now, we could possibly have a hostage situation here.
And, obviously, the sooner they bring this vehicle to a stop...
Unit six, ready at milepost 13.
Coming your way, six.
Well, that did the trick.
The automobile seems to be coming to a stop.
Chuck, what did they just use there?
It looked to be a special tire-puncturing chain.
And now the officers are approaching the car.
One of them has opened the door, and he has hold of the suspect.
He's pulling him out.
He doesn't seem to have a weapon.
He may not be armed but from our vantage point, it looks like he doesn't want to get out of that car.
Vicky!
Vicky!
Please get it out of my head.
Vicky! Vicky!
No! Let me go!
Let me go! Vicky!
No! Let me go!
I got to go!
Vicky! No!
...Hostage appears to be okay.
The Highway Patrol has her now.
But Chuck, it looks like that driver is still fighting.
Yes.
He's definitely putting up a bit of a fight.
He seems to be a man with a few choice words on the subject as you can see.
They're trying to restrain him.
I tell you what.
We're going to move back and try to get a wider angle.
See, there's the woman...
What the hell?
She's...
Vicky! Vicky!
There, see?
She's banging her head against the window.
- What the hell just happened?
- CUT! CUT! CUT!
Yeah?
Uh, Virgil Nokes?
I'm Agent Scully.
This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the F.B.I.
Jehovah's Witness?
No, sir.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
But we do have a free copy of "The Watchtower" for you if you'd like.
Uh, sir, this is just a routine check but, uh, we understand that you recently placedan order for...
5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
Oh, you people.
Come on in.
- Sugar beets.
- Excuse me?
I grow sugar beets.
I figure I got better things to do with my fertilizer than going... around blowing government buildings sky high.
Yeah. Well, as we said, sir this is just routine.
So routine, it numbs the mind.
I got my AG card and my papers
'round here somewhere.
Help me look for them, will you?
...As we reported earlier a wild police pursuit... ended in tragedy this morning with the death of a 36-year-old female hostage.
This was the scene west of Elko,
Nevada, one hour ago...
- Hey, Scully, take a look at this.
- ...died mysteriously while in custody.
We once again want to warn our viewers this footage is extremely graphic.
Now the hostage is still inside the car.
It appears that she is banging her head against the window...
At this time, highway patrol officials are refusing... to identify the woman or to speculate on how she died.
Though they do stress it was not the result of a gunshot.
A preliminary Coroner's report is not expected for a day or more.
Meanwhile residents of
Northern Nevada who first witnessed...
Thank you, Captain. That's no problem.
We'd be happy to help.
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll be happy to help what?
See you soon.
Mulder, we're not going to Nevada.
Come on, Scully.
Just one quick side trip.
No. Sorry, Mulder.
We have a whole new assignment.
Running down people that buy fertilizer?
This is scut work, bozo work--
This is the F.B.I. equivalent of being made to wear an orange jumpsuit... and pick up trash by the side of the highway-- they mean to humiliate us.
Look, Mulder, like it or not, humiliated or not, we're on domestic terrorism now and, yes, this is...
This is a punishment... but if we want to get back to where we want to be we have to follow orders.
We can't freelance.
You saw that news report.
What did you make of that?
I think that the obvious assumption is that the woman was shot, regardless of what the police say.
Maybe it was a sniper.
In the words of their captain
"she just sort of popped."
And what about this guy who supposedly tried to take her hostage, her husband?
Looked to me like he was trying to warn the cops before she died.
Now, the sun will rise in America tomorrow regardless of whether... or not we're at yet another farm investigating yet another enormous pile of doo-doo.
We can be in and out in a day.
Nobody has to know.
S-s-somebody!
Please!
It's starting!
Somebody!
Why can't we see him?
Well, hopefully later.
He pitched quite a fit in his cell-- screaming a bunch of nonsense that we were going to kill him the way we killed his wife.
You know, he's not a particularly stable individual.
Captain, he may need medical attention.
He's getting it.
Our doctor's with him now.
I mean, after whatever happened to his wife-- which I'd like to stress was not our fault-- we're not going to take any chances, you know?
Patrick Garland Crump of Montello, Nevada.
40-year-old roofer.
No history of mental illness.
No prior record.
He's got one now.
That Barracuda he jacked on the Utah state line?
He yanked some teenager out of the window threw his wife in back and took off.
Excuse me.
What do you think?
I'm thinking while we're here
I might take a look at Mr. Crump's wife.
I'm going to stay here and see if I can see Crump.
Captain, where's Montello?
Little town right here.
So that's where it started.
That's Crump's home.
Then he headed east in this direction... on the 5 about ten miles to the Utah border where he stole the car.
You got it.
Yeah, but you caught up with him in Wells. Where's that?
- That's here.
- So that means that he started... off in this direction. Then all of a sudden, he turned around and he headed west...
To Wells. Why?
The former Vicky Jenkins Crump.
I'm hoping you can tell me what I'm looking at 'cause this is a new one on me.
There's no gunpowder residue...
No carbon stippling.
There seems to be no evidence of an entry wound whatsoever.
There is none.
It's all exit, but how that could be...?
I'm finding what look like fragments of petrous bone embedded... in the remaining portion of the auditory canal.
In fact, I seem to be looking straight through to the osseous labyrinth or what's left of it.
It's almost like a little bomb went off in her ear.
- May I?
- Please.
There seems to be some kind of tumefaction within the lateral sinus.
Patient is a white male, age 40, no known history...
No, he just went rammy on me.
Accucheck is normal.
We did a narcan push... but he keeps getting worse.
Okay. I.V. beta blocker and topical nitro.
I don't know if you're going to get to talk to this fella after all.
Five's a crowd, buddy.
Whoa. Something must have worked.
Heart rate's dropping.
BP's headed south.
I don't understand;  what'd you just do?
Hell if I know but I'll take it.
Oh, God.
Come on, Mulder.
Hey, you, out!
This lab is quarantined. Go!
- Mulder?
- Yeah.
Mulder, it's me.
You know how to pick them, I'll tell you that.
Look, I have no idea what killed this woman but I have to assume it's communicable.
Yeah.
Another body has been found just outside of Montello-- same apparent cause of death-- some kind of massive aneurysm or rupture.
- Uh-huh.
- And Mulder, I've called the C.D.C.
They're on their way but Patrick Crump may be infected.
So you need to quarantine his cell and make sure that anybody... who's had any close contact with him whatsoever has been quarantined as well, and that means you, Mulder.
You're to have no contact with him whatsoever.
Mulder?
Well, that's going to be a little tough, Scully.
Drive.
Where are they?
Route 789, heading west.
We're keeping them in visual plus... we're in phone contact... not to mention the strings we pulled to keep this off local TV.
- Where are they going?
- Crump won't say.
Wherever it is, though, he ain't getting there.
- Roadblock?
- We'll shut him down east of Tuscarora--
- nice, clean, remote space we can own.
- All right.
I want the C.D.C. on-site.
I want the officers making the arrest to be wearing level... two or better anti-contamination suits.
I want the car decontaminated.
I want Agent Mulder and Crump decontaminated.
- I want them quarantined separately.
- You got it.
Crump says that if we don't pull back our escort he's going to shoot your partner.
You just leave me the hell alone!
Now!
How about if we just pull over and let me out, too, huh?
- I must be cramping your style.
- Just... Shut up.
It's you people.
- Figures.
- What figures?
Shut up.
Hey! No!
No!
That is... so stupid, Crump.
- Shut up.
- That is so stupid.
You shut up and drive, you understand?
- What are you doing?
- What? What am I doing?
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm composing a sonnet.
- I'm slowing down for a light.
- Go!
Go!
Crump?
Is this what happened to your wife?
This same thing?
If you stop moving, you die?
I think I saw this movie.
Why didn't you tell anybody?
Why didn't you tell the police?
Oh, geez.
I don't know how well you recall the last 30 seconds... but your life is in my hands regardless of whether or not you hold that gun.
- It's right here, boy.
- Just tell me everything you know.
- That may be the only way I can help you.
- You people put me here!
Shut up.
I'm guessing we got two or three miles before the roadblock.
- What roadblock? I got rid of the cops.
- Check your window.
Oh, God.
Men, if we get stopped...
Subject's turning off 789 about a mile east of your position... and is heading north on a fire road.
Looks like he's going to miss you.
Say what?
- What's the report, Captain?
- They lost them.
They were last seen on a forestry service road.
Trees were too thick.
Our helicopter lost sight of them.
How did Crump know to avoid the roadblock?
That's the question.
I was hoping your Agent Mulder would manage to steer him toward it, but...
Maybe Agent Mulder steered him away from it.
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe he knew something that we don't.
Agent Scully, I've got the cell cultures from the second victim.
Anything?
So far, I'm seeing no evidence of infection in either victim.
So then, we're in the clear?
No, no. Not necessarily.
I mean, something killed these people.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Scully.
Agent Scully?,
Please hold for Assistant Director Kersh.
- Agent Scully.
- Yes, sir.
How is Southern Idaho?
Agent Scully? Southern Idaho?
Think carefully.
Sir, I am not currently in the state of Idaho.
No, you're not.
In the course of prosecuting our assignment in Idaho,
Agent Mulder and I came across a situation in Nevada... which we both strongly felt needed our immediate attention.
I eagerly await your report.
In the meantime, agents of our Las Vegas field office will be available... to assist you in tracking down Agent Mulder.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Agent Scully...
I think, at this point I want to see him alive even more than you do.
Can I see that for a minute?
This man worked at
Silver State Power reading meters.
Yes.
What if he read the meter at Vicky Crump's place?
Crump?
Crump, what else can you tell me about what's happening to you?
Mr. Crump.
You call me by my last name, you say "mister" in front of it.
- "Mister." I got you.
- Not Crump. Mr. Crump.
I can think of something else
I'd like to call you.
I could put "mister" in front of that, too if you'd like.
You know, what kind of name is Mulder, anyway? What is that, like...
- like, Jewish?
- Excuse me?
Jewish... It is, right?
It's Mr. Mulder to you, you peanut-picking bastard.
Now, Mr. Crump what can you tell me about what's happening to you?
- What?
- You're going...
- The wrong way.
- What do you mean so "The wrong way"?
- Go this... Go this way!
- I can't... I can't go...
I can't go left.
There's only trees there.
Crump.
Crump...
It's west. Huh, west?
You got to head west.
It's just like you did with your wife.
You took her and you headed west.
It's not just motion; it has to be in one direction.
Is that right?
What the hell happened to you?
Okay, I want a thorough search with an eye to the usual disease vectors.
You got it.
I think we're witnessing the same pathology here.
We need to get a blood sample.
Let's go.
Try to hold him still!
Hang on.
Let me sedate him.
One more time.
You woke up this morning... then what?
We have been through this.
You woke up this morning but you didn't go to work. Why?
It was raining. You don't shingle in the rain.
I was up at 6:00, reading the paper.
What was your wife doing?
Cooking, man. Breakfast. She was just putting breakfast on the table when the...
- You looked up.
- I looked up, and I saw that she had this nosebleed she didn't even know she had.
- What caused it?
- What do I... I'm... I'm, like, Quincy?
How the hell should I know what caused it?
It just happened.
Ten, 15 minutes later, she just...
Starts getting sick.
Said she got a headache that just... keeps getting worse and worse.
Then she starts... screaming.
I didn't know what the hell to do.
I just, uh...
I got her in the truck and...
Taking her to the hospital... but then it seemed like the faster we went the better she'd do... but just as soon as
I try to slow down or stop...
I'm sorry about your wife.
Sure, you are...
You and the rest of your Jew F.B.I.
- Crump...
- Oh, yeah.
You think I don't know, huh?
You think I'm just some ignorant pudknocker, don't you?
But I get it, man!
I see what this is!
I am not sick and I do not have the flu.
Vicky and me were just some kind of...
Government guinea pigs.
- You think the government did this to you?
- Hell, yeah. Who else?
You see it all the time on the TV: they're dropping Agent Orange, they're putting radiation in little retarded kids' gonads...
Oh, yeah. You sons of bitches sneaking around my woods at night--
I seen you.
You think I don't know?
Well, on behalf of the international Jewish conspiracy...
I just need to inform you that we're... almost out of gas.
The trailer looks clean-- no readily apparent vectors.
Dogs, housewives...
Whatever this thing is, it doesn't discriminate.
There are zoonotic pathogens which spread among species.
Look at that.
The Crumps have a neighbor.
Hello!
Hello?
Doctor?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, no. It's...
It's okay, ma'am. It's okay.
- Who are you?
- It's all right. I'm sorry.
Go away! Go away!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay, Crump, we got about one more mile.
I'll make it fast.
You ready?
Here goes nothing.
Hey, turn on the pump!
Number four!
Three!
Number three!
Turn it on!
You got to pay before you pump, buddy!
Hey, dammit, that's my car!
Where the hell do you think you're going?
One deaf woman survives unscathed while everything else around her dies.
Why?
What... What are you doing?
The pathology of this thing...
It affects the inner ear... and this area right here is ground zero.
What if what we're looking for is some kind of a sound?
Seriously?
Oh.
Excuse me.
- Scully.
- It's Van Gelder.
Agent, I don't know what the hell your partner's thinking... but not only is he actively evading my officers, now he's stolen a car.
- Come again?
- You heard right.
He left behind a crazy note addressed to you.
- You there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Read it to me.
"Crump sick; will die if stopped same as wife.
Must head west to keep alive.
No roadblocks!" Exclamation point.
- This make any sense to you?
- Take him at his word.
Let him through.
Let him through?
Look, uh...
No offense, Agent Scully but how 'bout you run that by your superiors 'cause frankly,
I think they'll say different.
I'll take that under advisement.
Agent Scully, again, I got to say
I feel like we got a situation here that...
Faster.
I'm doing 70.
You got to go faster.
It's getting worse.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
That's good. Okay.
Hey, uh...
The Jew stuff?
No offense.
I mean, uh...
A man can't help who he's born to.
That was an apology, right?
Gee, I don't know if I can see to drive my eyes are tearing up so bad.
Whatever, man.
Why are you doing this?
- Why am I doing what?
- This.
It's not in your best interest to make me question that right now.
How do I know you ain't doing exactly what they want you to?
Hmm?
Driving me all around creation, experimenting on me... How do I know it ain't that?
I guess you don't.
I ain't saying you are.
I'm just saying...
That's no way to treat a man... take away his dignity like that.
It ain't right.
Better just to kill him.
That's all I'm saying.
Hey, you got to stay alive if you want to stick it to the government.
If you die, you let them off the hook. Am I right?
- Huh?
- You're right. You're damn straight.
We'll figure this out.
You'd better figure quick.
We're running out of west.
Lieutenant Breil?
My name is Dana Scully.
I called in regard to the electrical equipment the Navy is maintaining...
- in the town of Montello.
- Right. Listen, I don't know if there's... been some miscommunication between you and your Washington office, but, uh...
- My Washington office?
- Yeah.
I was under the impression that I'd explained this to the F.C.C.'s satisfaction.
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry to make you run through it again, uh...
For my official report to the, uh... To the F.C.C.
Okay.
At 6:17 yesterday morning during a test of our ground conduction radio system... a situation arose in which our equipment experienced a brief power surge.
That's what interrupted television reception in the four-state area.
However, steps have already been taken to insure this won't happen again.
The ground conduction radio-- th-that would be Project Seafarer?
The specifics of what we do here are classified, ma'am.
Sure, sure. Um...
Would you happen to know what effect such a surge might have on, uh...
On an organism... Say, a...
Say, a human being?
- Theoretically speaking.
- Theoretically speaking?
Well, that's classified as well, ma'am.
- Crump?
- Mr. Crump.
Mr. Crump...
What is it, Mr. Mulder?
Mulder, are you okay?
Yeah, aside from terminal cell phone withdrawal...
That, and I got to pee.
Where are you?
I'm just about to board a justice department jet...
Hopefully, I'll overshoot you.
- Headed where?
- I don't know, Mulder.  You tell me.
I'm guessing wherever the hell route 36 ends but we can't stop, Scully.
I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do next.
Well, I think I have a loose theory as to what caused this.
- Well, lay it on me.
- Okay.
Mulder, you know what E.L.F. waves are?
Extremely low radio transmissions?
Yeah. It uses an antenna, like, 50 miles long.
The military uses it to communicate with the trident submarines,
Project Seafarer, Project Haarp.
Well, Seafarer has an antenna array stretching beneath the edge of Patrick Crump's property.
Now, ELF fields have been shown to...
To produce biological effects in human tissue... inducing electrical currents, altering chemical reactions.
Not to mention that as a potential weapons application it's been referred to... as "electrical nerve gas" or may be behind the so-called "Taos Hum."
What if some overload some...
Some hum from this system... could somehow match the resonant frequency of the human skull?
I mean, what if it could induce a like hum that could...
That could somehow exert a... a rising pressure on the labyrinth of the inner ear in a sense shattering it?
But with constant movement somehow ameliorating that pressure making it bearable.
- But why only westward movement?
- I don't know, Mulder, I don't know. I mean...
I mean, maybe it has to follow certain lines of force electrical or magnetic.
The big question, Scully, is what do we do about it?
Well, I think I know, Mulder, but it's nothing that Mr. Crump is going to like.
We'll be there.
What?
Well, whether they did this to you intentionally or not, you were right.
They did it to you.
So, what do we... what do we do?
Your one chance is that we meet my partner at the end of the highway.
There, she will insert a long, large-bore needle into your inner ear... hopefully relieving the pressure.
Now, when we get there she's going to have to work fast.
She's only going to have one chance.
She's not going to be able to use any anesthetic... and it will probably leave you deaf.
But I'll live, right?
Well, that's what it's all about.
All right, man. Let's do it.
Mr. Mulder, could you go a little faster, please?
- Just a little more is all I need.
- Sure.
Just a little bit faster.
Get ready!
"Justice department jet: 2.6 turbine hours round trip at $1,400 an hour.
Car rental-- over-mileage, out-of-state use penalties: $346.
Compensation to one Walter R. Duncan... for unauthorized use of his 1968 Caprice station wagon: $500."
Why don't you bill me?
I'll bill your partner instead.
You too obviously relish the role of martyr.
Okay. So are we done here?
Back to the bozo work investigating huge piles of manure?
You can always quit.
- Sir, Agent Mulder has been through a lot.
- And you apologize for him a lot.
- I've noticed that about you.
- I'm not apologizing for this.
Because of his work, the D.O.D. is shutting down their antenna array in northeastern Nevada.
Our participation in this case has saved lives.
I don't see you proving that.
The Department of Defense admits no culpability whatsoever.
Furthermore, they say the closing of the facility was coincidental.
Right.
Don't misunderstand me, Agent.
I don't care if you and your partner saved a school bus... full of doe-eyed urchins on their way to Sunday bible camp.
You no longer investigate X-Files.
You are done... and the sooner you and Mulder come to recognize that, the better for both of you.
Big piles of manure.
You have to ask yourself... what brought the person to this point.
What was seen in his face, his manner, that channeled him here.
You have to convince yourself... that this person has something hidden that you have to find.
You check his bags, but it's his face... his gestures that you're really watching.
Thank you.
He's staring straight at you.
Look at him, carefully.
What do you see?
Security 4 to Baggage Claim 17.
- Where you headed?
- Downtown.
- You want to split it?
- S-Sure.
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?
Well, can't you cancel?
What are these?
Ballet tickets for tonight.
- You don't like ballet?
- Well, some ballets.
Well, that's exactly what this is: Some ballet.
Look, you can always scalp the tickets at the door.
You mean, take these in exchange...
- for you paying your part of the fare.
- Well, what do you think?
- See ya, John.
- Good night, John.
- See you guys.
- See ya.
Christina, here you are.
Hurry and get dressed.
- People are asking for you.
- * Exotica *
- She's right over there. I'll get her.
- * Exotica *
Bye.
Yeah!
Let's bring those big, hairy palms together, gentlemen... and have a nice, big round of applause... for Kali!
Kali.
Yes, indeed. Kali.
And you, too, can-You, too, can have Kali come over to your table... for only five dollars, where she can show you the mysteries of her world.
Trust me, gentlemen. Trust me.
Baby, baby, baby!
Do it for me, baby!
My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.
What is it that gives a schoolgirl her special innocence?
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers... light as a spring rain?
Oh, my God. My God.
Or is it her firm, young flesh inviting your every caress... enticing you to explore... her deepest and most private secrets?
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you decide that one for yourselves.
Please join me in welcoming a sassy... bit of jailbait to our stage.
Yes, indeed.
Come out, sweet Chrissy.
Wherever you are, baby, come on out.
You think you're bad, baby?
You're bad.
That will be $5.50.
Thank you.
- Eric?
- What?
Linda finished her dance.
Let's bring those big, hairy palms together, gentlemen.
Give it up.
Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.
Have a nice, big round of applause for Linda. Yeah.
Yes, indeed, Linda.
And just a reminder that there is nothing Linda would love more... than to slink over to your table and... give you your own private show for only five dollars.
That's right.
Five dollars is all it takes to have one of our beautiful foxes... come over to your table and get you all hot and bothered.
But, hey, why be bothered... when you're being treated like a king?
You've had a rough day.
Don't you think you owe it to yourselves to... do something that'll make you feel like you're someone special?
You are someone special.
Five dollars is all it takes to prove it.
Yes, let's have a nice big round of applause for Michelle.
My God, that was beautiful.
Baby, you come out.
And just to remind you that there's nothing Michelle would love more... than to come over to your table and give you your own private dance.
Hello, gentlemen!
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?
Anybody, for five dollars, you can have Kali.
Kali at your own private table.
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.
What is it about a schoolgirl... that gives her that special innocence?
Is it the way that they can gaze at you... waiting for you to say something with so much expectation and hope... that you're just... you're just paralyzed into... into silence?
- Look, I want to give this back to you.
- Why?
Well, you see, those tickets were given to me... and I just feel uncomfortable about having sold them.
- That's okay.
- No, no, no, really, I...
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.
David.
Can I use this to take you out for a drink?
- That's very kind of you, but...
- But what?
But I really have to get home.
Thanks.
Are you available next Thursday?
- I think so, yeah.
- Good, good.
- Tracey?
- Yeah?
I'm not that boring, am I?
- What do you mean?
- Well, the earphones.
I mean, we used to listen to the radio... and you used to ask me all sorts of questions.
So you want me to ask more questions?
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's something y-you want to know.
Okay. I'll see what I can think up.
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Did someone say something?
- No.
So, what's the point?
I've just noticed a change in your attitude.
Look, I would understand if you would prefer not to introduce Christina.
I could do it myself.
Actually, I've been thinking that, perhaps...
I should be getting more involved in the introductions overall.
I could have my own microphone, like my mother used to do.
No, I mean, I actually enjoy introducing Christina.
I mean, I find it very therapeutic, you know?
- That's not what you're getting paid for.
- Well, it seems to me... that I'm being paid to make every girl seem like she's something special, right?
So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.
So, I mean, when it comes to Christina, I, you know...
My imagination is bound to run a little wilder.
There's nothing that I can do to control that, Zoe.
Makes the clients uncomfortable.
And you think your state puts them at ease?
Hey.
Is he kicking?
All the time.
Do you feel like touching it?
How are you feeling about this?
- Fine.
- Fine?
Are you happy?
For you.
What about you, Eric?
What about you?
Well, I guess I got to be pretty careful about my feelings, right?
I mean... that's why we have a contract, isn't it?
There's plaster dust all over the apartment.
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was coughing in my sleep last night.
You told me that it was going to be comfortable for me to live there... and it is not comfortable.
There's plastic on the furniture.
That is not comfortable living.
Yeah. Oh, come on, look.
You told me you were going to strip the wallpaper, not strip the walls down.
Well, no, if you'd, if you'd told me in the first place...
If you'd told me what kind of job it was, then I would have considered it.
Although, it's-it makes me seem like you've maybe made a mistake.
That's what it makes me suspect.
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.
Well, you did a job, but it's not the job that I asked you to do.
It's not the job we agreed on.
Well, I can get anyone, any number of people to do this.
Yeah, that's just fine with me.
Yeah, can I help you?
- Mr. Pinto?
- Yes.
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke on the phone a couple of weeks ago.
- Revenue Canada.
- Oh, of course.
- How was your trip?
- It was fine.
- And when did you get back?
- Just yesterday.
Good weather?
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.
- Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, sure.
- It's just that you seem a little...
- A little what?
- Flustered.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, I can't talk to you right now.
L-Later.
Okay.
So this is where I'd find all the bank statements?
Yeah, that's right, and those there.
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.
- Is it a little hot for you back here?
- It's, yeah.
You could turn it down a tad.
I suppose you have to be pretty careful with the temperature with the animals.
Well, they're a lot hardier than you'd think.
I wouldn't think they're not hardy.
I mean, just because they're exotic doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.
It is, after all, a jungle out there, isn't it?
So, how long will this take?
- An audit?
- Yes.
Well, it depends on how prepared you are.
Have you got an accountant?
Well, no.
Well, no, not really, no.
Not really?
- So this will take a while?
- I could be done by the end of the day.
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.
Okay. Well, if you have any questions...
I'll let you know.
Did you know her?
Sort of.
She was your neighbor?
I... I baby-sat her a couple times.
So you knew her pretty well?
Yeah. I did.
What about you?
I just... I heard this thing was being organized, so...
It seems so... surreal, doesn't it?
- What?
- That we'd find anything.
I mean, there's so many places you could hide something in this country.
- My name's Eric.
- I'm Christina.
Hey, nice to meet you, Christina.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Don't you want to touch it?
You don't have to. It's one of those things people normally like to do.
What is this thing about Eric calling you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?
- What's this thing?
- It bothers me.
Why?
It makes you out like a child or something.
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks or the blouse or the way I act, right?
Do you find it strange that he would still want to work here?
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury of deciding what to do with our lives.
It's a job, and he's getting paid all right.
I just find it cruel.
So fire him.
As a favor.
How can you be so detached?
Well, I'm finished for the day.
For the day?
You mean you have to come back?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
When is a good time?
But, but, I thought you said it was only going to take one day.
Well, it can only take a day.
But you have to understand, you don't keep very well-organized books.
That's why you should really think about getting someone in to help you.
Just somebody to come in once or twice a week... depending on the amount of activity and... the type of activity.
What do you mean by that?
Well, some types of activity are more complicated, aren't they?
It might take more effort to account for.
I found a gun in one of the drawers.
- Well, that belonged to my dad.
- Your dad?
Yeah, I guess he just kept it, just in case.
- In case of what?
- Well, in case of trouble.
With the animals?
Would Monday be a good time for me to come back...
- Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, how about tomorrow?
I have appointments for tomorrow.
Actually, I'm pretty busy 'til the end of the week.
Monday's not good?
No, Monday's fine.
- Around 10:00?
- Yeah, sure.
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.
Strange to think that bird is probably going to outlive us.
Strange?
Did you ever teach it to say anything?
Yes.
- What does it say, Harold?
- It doesn't really say it anymore.
It forgot?
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.
It must have just lost interest.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.
What about him?
Dad?
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.
So, how does it sound?
- It's good.
- Yeah? Good, good.
- Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
- What's "too late"?
- Around 11:00 or so?
- Okay.
You looking for tickets?
Yeah. How much?
That's too hot.
He comes in here every other night.
He has his favorite drink... at his favorite table with his favorite dancer.
Sometimes he has to wait for her, and sometimes she's waiting for him.
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's show time at the Exotica.
And just to remind you that five dollars is all it takes... to have one of our lovely ladies come over to your table... and show you the mysteries of their world.
Now if that didn't turn you on, gentlemen, nothing will.
Let's have a nice, big, warm round of applause for Christina, gentlemen!
Yes, Christina!
What are you thinking?
I was just thinking, what would happen if someone hurt you?
H-How could anyone hurt me?
If I'm not there to protect you.
I- You'll always be there to protect me.
An angel.
Why would somebody want to do something like that?
How could somebody even think of doing something like that?
You mustn't worry.
Eric! Eric!
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.
Let's have a nice, big round of applause for Melinda.
Listen, I feel bad about, taking your money.
- Why?
- The tickets were given to me, and...
I should have given them away for free.
- Well, that would have been stupid.
- Why?
Because no one gives anything away.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, p-positive.
Do you consider my dad a friend?
- Why?
- J-Just asking.
Does he consider me a friend?
I don't know.
Why not?
'Cause he always seems different when you're around.
- Different in what way?
- J-Tense.
Is that bad?
Well, I don't really like to feel tense around my friends.
Well, sure, yeah.
I didn't like to feel tense around my friends when I was your age either.
But you do now?
No, it's not a question of liking it or not.
It's just something that happens.
Why?
Well... as you get older... you become aware that the people you meet and the person you are... as carrying a certain amount of baggage.
And, and that baggage creates tension.
So what do you do about it?
Well, you can pretend it's not there... or you can choose not to have friends... or you can acknowledge that it's there and have friends anyway.
Like my dad?
Right.
I don't think that I like my dad when he's around you.
Well, that's... because your dad doesn't like himself when he's around me.
But that's okay.
That's... part of what friends do to each other.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I... I just graduated.
Really? So did I.
- Oh, yeah? In what?
- Radio communications.
- So, so is that what you do?
- That's what I'd like to do.
I do a little freelance deejay stuff... but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.
I thought you might do something like that.
Drive a cab?
No, do something where, you use your voice.
Why?
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.
Because of my voice?
I just need to find a structure, you know?
What do you mean?
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just-My days just slip by, you know?
- Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
- Yeah.
Not if you want to make something of yourself, you know?
What do you want to make of yourself?
I don't know. I just feel that I was meant to do something with my time.
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be thinking of this this way.
I'd be able to just continue what I was doing, you know?
Do you have a lot of friends?
Not really. Do you?
- No.
- Yeah.
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?
Yeah, sometimes.
When?
Like right now.
Why?
'Cause I just met you and...
I just feel like telling someone, you know?
No way. No way, no way.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Jesus.
- What's the matter?
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.
Sometimes I just feel like throwing them all away, you know?
What are you looking for, Zoe?
- I mean, is this where you see your future?
- My future?
The club?
When Mom died, my immediate idea was to get rid of this place. Just sell it.
I never thought it would have any interest for me.
So why did it?
I used to be very shy as a child.
I used to watch my mother for hours... just admiring her sense of freedom.
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.
So you feel better about adopting her options rather than creating your own?
I have created my own options too.
I know.
It's your contract for the baby with Eric.
I found it.
Does he know?
I would hope so.
Otherwise he might just think I'm disgusted with him for no particular reason.
Look, I really desperately needed this child... and it just worked out with Eric.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You know, I remember when your mother built this hallway.
She... she built it for this very rich man who used to come here.
He used to get off watching us dance for other guys, so he actually paid her... to construct this very special place that he could watch us from.
Your mother never told us that.
She said it was to protect us... so she could patrol things.
And I believed her.
Until Eric told me the truth.
Why did you believe him?
I made a choice.
And Eric promised me he'd never lie to me.
How could anyone... hurt you?
Take you away from me?
How could anyone?
What's this machine?
It's an incubator.
- Wh-What's it for?
- Well, what do you think it's for?
- Eggs.
- That's right.
Are they yours?
Wh-What do you mean?
I mean, shouldn't you be sitting on them or something?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I guess I've abandoned the nest.
What's inside of them?
- The eggs?
- Yes.
Well, Hyacinth Macaws... if you want to know the absolute truth.
And where did you get them?
From... very far away.
Hey, check her out?
I said check her out.
- Yeah.
- You talking to me?
Yes, I'm talking to you.
What? Check who out?
The babe that's dancing for you, man.
You've given her quite a run for your money, man.
What do you mean by that?
- She's been dancing for you all night.
- Yeah.
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've noticed you with her other nights too.
You come in here all the time or...
Yeah. All the time.
This-Visuals, you know?
It's good.
But... she seems to have a bit of a thing for you, doesn't she?
We... get along.
I'm sure you do, my friend.
What do you two talk about?
Just... the usual, I guess.
The usual?
I don't think you're talking about what I would call "usual."
- Why not?
- Because I can tell.
You get pretty intense, my friend.
Well, I guess that's just the way I am.
So, Hey, why don't you give her a little touch?
- You're not supposed to touch.
- But she is into it, believe me.
Yeah.
- How do you know?
- Everybody knows, man.
Trust me, my friend.
Trust me. Just a little touch.
Nothing too drastic.
Then you will get the full experience, my friend... and you will love it.
You will love it. Okay?
And what happens when I touch her?
What happens?
You're outta here, man!
Get out!
Come on. Get down there.
Come on. Go.
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!
Move!
What's so funny?
It's like pettin' a gorilla.
Well...
Was your father this hairy?
No, I... I got it from my mother.
I mean, I mean, from my mother's side of the family.
That's where you inherit hair patterns.
- My uncle's bald.
- On your mother's side?
Well, I guess I'm talking about usual patterns.
There's always exceptions.
That's...
That's the way these things... work.
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
No, I'm fine.
You don't look fine.
You worry about me, don't you?
You think this is normal?
- What?
- What we do.
What do we do?
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.
You know that feeling you get sometimes, Tracey... that you didn't ask to be brought into the world?
Yeah.
Well, then who did?
What?
If you think that you didn't ask... to be brought into the world... then who did?
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if you wanted to be brought into the world.
You just ended up getting here.
So the question is, now that you're here... who's asking you to stay?
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Look, are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Yes.
Good night.
Good night.
- He touched you?
- He didn't want to.
- What do you mean?
- I know him.
- We all know him. He's crazy about you.
- Not like that.
Why didn't you get one of the boys to handle this, Eric?
Because I didn't think of it.
I just saw him touch her, and...
Why didn't you ask him to leave?
- Because he wouldn't have listened.
- How do you know that?
Because he's in his own world, the ass-wipe.
I don't know where you're both coming from.
You are telling me that he touched you, but he really didn't.
And you're saying that you overreacted, but you didn't have a choice?
- I didn't.
- Why not?
Why not?
Because he touched you.
Okay.
All I'm concerned about is if he makes a case...
I have to know what happened.
We told you what happened, Zoe.
And that is what happened?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Is that it?
Hi. This is Thomas.
I am not in at the present time, but I am in town.
Please leave a message following the beep.
Good morning.
You're probably not up yet, so you haven't seen what I've done.
I'm a customs officer at the airport.
Actually, I saw you the other day when you were having your bags inspected.
I know-I know how you probably smuggled those eggs in.
There's a special unit at work. I think they give them to the zoo or something.
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.
Where are they?
- I took them.
- Where?
- I'd like to see you again.
- Oh, no.
No, they're in the country now.
They're definitely in the country.
It's just I don't have them with me presently, but it doesn't mean I can't get them.
And if you can give me, like... just a couple...
- Good morning.
- Hi. And I'm here. Okay.
So I'll call...
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
You look like you're in worse shape than I am.
What happened to you?
I fell down some stairs and...
- Are you okay?
- Well, do I look okay?
No, not really.
Well, I'm better than I look.
Here, I got you a coffee.
I didn't...
I didn't know how you took it.
Black's fine.
- I added cream.
- That's okay.
- No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
- No, really...
What is it?
Well, it's just that this has cream in it too.
It's milk.
Good.
Okay, well, I'll...
I'll get to work.
What?
What is it?
What is it that gives a schoolgirl her special innocence?
Is it the way they smell?
The sweet smell of their perfume, of their hair?
The aroma of fresh flowers... and all that other stuff that hasn't been fucked up... by late nights and a lot of bad food.
Is it their gestures... and the way they move?
The way their body still holds on to some semblance of self-respect and... and dignity?
When they wrap their beautiful legs around you... tight and holding on, looking at you... you looking at them.
It's just...
Or is it whatever comes out of their cute little mouths?
All those questions, all that wondering that...
It's just, you know, you...
They got their whole lives ahead of them, you know?
And you've wasted half of yours away.
Damn.
What is it?
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?
What sort of feeling?
That I wasn't ever meant to be satisfied.
Satisfied with what?
A lot of things.
I mean, it seems to me that every time I'm about to... you know, get a hold of something or someone... it's just bound to slip away.
Maybe you want it to slip away.
Maybe I want what to slip away?
The things that you think you're about to have.
What would you think about that?
As a general philosophy... or how it pertains to you?
You think you could talk about how it pertains to me?
What do you mean?
Well, I feel like I want you.
Do you think that means you'll slip away?
Dad?
I'm not going to baby-sit for Uncle Francis anymore.
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.
That's absurd.
Why?
Dad, he pretends I'm still baby-sitting for him.
Why would you think that?
Because he's paying me.
To house-sit.
Twenty dollars an hour?
When did it go up?
He wants to believe that Lisa's still there.
I make it easier for him to convince himself.
Francis always had strange ways to convince himself... of many things.
Things that never happened, things that might happen.
People who did things for reasons, but they didn't.
What has any of this got to do with me, Dad?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
So why do I have to keep going there?
You don't.
And you'll tell him?
I was in here the other night when that guy was thrown out.
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?
- Why do you think he would touch you?
- Why do you think he would touch you?
Why do you think he would touch you?
Well, what do you think was going through his mind when he...
Or-Or what was he thinking?
- Well...
- What's so funny?
Well, this is a joke, right?
Not at all.
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.
But I'm not hiding anything.
Thomas, you're hiding a smuggling operation... that brings in over $200,000 a year, probably a lot more.
We've suspected you for a long time.
I was just brought in to confirm what was already known.
So how do you want me to report back?
All I'm asking for is a bit of help.
That's all.
It's very important for me to know these things. Just ask her these questions.
Do this for me, and you have a clean slate.
This really hasn't been my day.
So change things.
Make it your day.
And all you men sitting near that stage, I can see you.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that "because I'm sitting next to that stage..."
I'm getting the same feeling as all those guys...
"shoveling out that cash for their own private dancer."
Well, you know, you guys want to watch, go to the movies.
We're in the live-action business here, gents.
And, okay, granted...
Granted, that beautiful creature writhing before you on stage... she maybe, you know, smiles at you.
She winks her eyes at you occasionally... and you may feel like the man.
Is that all you guys are looking for?
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.
Invite one of our lovely ladies over to your table where the real action is.
- Yeah!
- Hi.
I'm really sorry that took so long, or I took so long.
- Hi.
- It's such a busy night.
Hi. I'm Chrissy.
Hi. I'm Thomas.
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.
Oh, thanks.
Are you from out of town?
Yes.
Where are you from?
San Francisco.
You're kidding.
I love San Francisco.
You've-You've been there?
Yeah, I was there a couple of years ago with my debating team.
Debating team?
That's-I admire someone who can debate well.
I mean, who can debate instead of just argue.
Well, anyone can argue, but it's a good skill, discipline... to be able to debate and stand back.
And that's something you can apply in your life... outside of school.
And, and when you're meeting someone or negotiating.
Negotiating?
Well, I mean, if you have...
If you have to...
It's a good skill to learn, as opposed to cheerleading or...
Well, that's what I say.
Don't be nervous about this, Thomas.
- We're gonna have some fun, okay?
- Sure.
Sure.
I was here the other night...
What night was that?
The night th-that guy was thrown out.
You were dancing for him.
His name is Francis.
What happened?
He was a bad boy.
- Wh-What do you mean by that?
- What do I mean?
I mean, have you danced for him before a lot?
- And has he ever been thrown out before?
- No.
So what do you think happened?
He touched me.
And when you're dancing for the customer... they can't touch.
Yes, but why do you think he touched you last night?
Has he ever touched you before?
Is this what you really want to talk about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?
Well, I just want to know what you think was going on in his mind.
Are you here for some kind of psychology conference?
Well, yes.
I am, actually.
He's...
He's a very particular case.
Particular in what way?
You want the full story?
Sure.
His daughter was murdered a couple of years ago... and then he was implicated.
- For th-the murder?
- Yeah.
- But why?
- I don't know.
I don't really remember the details.
I mean, he was cleared, and then they caught the guy who did it.
But... it obviously had, like, this... this incredible effect on him.
I mean, he is...
He's just so fucked up about it.
You know...
Thomas...
Francis and I have a very special type of relationship.
And I've never-I've never minded.
But then he chose to violate it.
S-Special in what way?
Well, we've, we've always had this understanding.
I mean, I need him for certain things... and... he needs me for certain things.
I mean, that's the way it's been.
And how did he violate that?
He-He violated that in his-his, in his role and what he was supposed to do for me.
Wh-What's he su-Why?
What's he supposed to do for you? I mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.
Because I was doing things for him... and he's done things for me.
What has he done for you?
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Okay, this is really stupid.
And then I'm getting so emotional over the fact that he touched me... because, I mean, he was, he was always paying me... to do him this favor and...
- What favor?
- I don't know, Thomas.
- Why do you want to know all this?
- Well, I'm sorry, but I...
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives her that special innocence, gentlemen?
Such a thing that you have absolutely no control over.
You never have.
And you never will.
After this break, we'll be right back with sweet Chrissy...
He's not supposed to do that.
- Who'll help us answer that question.
- Do what?
He's not supposed to...
He's not suppose...
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.
He's not supposed to call me when I'm talking with a client.
Why? Do you have to go now?
Yeah.
But I want to come back, and I want to, you know, talk.
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.
Sure, sure, sure.
Okay. I'll see you soon.
I'm going to move to the washroom.
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending a lot of time with that lady.
Are you-Are you talking to me?
Yeah.
You seem to... to both hit it off together.
- Well, I guess.
- Yeah.
I guess that can happen.
So what do you guys talk about?
Just things.
What sort of things?
Oh, this and that.
"This and that"?
You know, it's amazing how... you can hit it off with someone like that, isn't it?
Have you ever noticed that some people just drift into your life... like you've known them forever?
I mean, there are some people that you can remember... the moment that you met them really clearly.
And other people that... it seems like you've known them forever, even though you haven't.
And they all become part of this continuous memory you have of yourself.
This ongoing...
Are you with me?
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, here you are, y-you know... you're having this beautiful conversation with her.
You're getting to know each other, and...
I mean, there's other guys that come in here.
There's this one guy who comes in here every other night or something... and he spends a few hours with her.
But he never really gets to know her, you know?
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two...
She really seems to be herself with you.
Well, how do you know?
What? That she's being herself?
Yeah.
Because I used to be her lover.
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.
Look, why not?
Look, can I... Can I at least just talk to the manager?
- You want to talk to the manager?
- Yeah.
You have to understand that we have very strict rules... regarding this sort of behavior here.
- And I have always respected them.
- And this one time you didn't.
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown, is that this one time... happened in a room full of other men who were watching.
Now, if I let you back into the club... what's to stop them from trying to do the same thing?
I told you.
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.
And you believed that someone?
- This is Security.
- Please, sit down.
Thank you.
Why did you touch her?
- Well, I needed to make sure.
- Why?
What if she let you?
What would you have done?
I'd have been disappointed.
I'm not sure...
I understand you.
That's not the way she was raised.
You know her? Personally?
There is another club I can recommend.
I need to come here.
- I understand that very well.
- No, I don't think you understand.
Exotica is a special place.
My mother was dedicated to creating a very particular type of atmosphere... and I would like to maintain that.
You don't understand.
Mr. Brown, we're all aware of what you've gone through.
You've suffered a lot.
But you have to understand that
Exotica is here for your amusement.
We're here to entertain, not to heal.
There are other places for that.
Other places?
I can give you a list.
Mr. Brown?
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?
I just met this man in the washroom.
What man?
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.
I didn't really have a chance to see him.
- So how did you meet him?
- He just started talking to me.
And what did he say?
Well, he said he used to be your lover.
Well, it's always a sad moment, gentlemen... when that clock strikes that magic hour... and we have to send you out into the long and dark and lonely night.
But just remember... we're only ever just a dream away... wherever that is.
- I guess...
- I have to go.
Oh, okay.
Wait a minute.
- Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
- No, no, no.
- Thomas, please, don't.
- No, no. I insist.
Please.
Thank you.
Your dad told me about... you not wanting to baby-sit anymore.
There's no baby to sit.
Well, I just want you to know, I understand.
Understand what?
That this might all seem a little weird.
A little?
- I just want to thank you, Tracey.
- For what?
You've been very patient.
And... if you think the time has come for this to end, then I understand.
Thank you.
Good night, Francis.
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.
Christina...
And then-and then he follows this guy to the washroom... and he tells this guy that, that he was my lover.
Well, he was.
It's going too far, Zoe.
Actually, baby, you have no idea how far it's gone.
You know,
I told him to touch you.
I said you were into it. Yeah.
It used to be wonderful watching you dance for him, seeing how you could soothe him.
I mean, it soothed me.
You know, you soothed me.
Do you understand that?
- Hey, hey.
- Don't, don't, don't!
- Stop. Stop that!
- Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!
- Stop!
- Just fuck off, Zoe!
- Stop it when I say! Eric!
- Stop it!
Chill out! Chill out!
Chill out! Relax!
- All right? Relax!
- Eric, come here!
- John! Get out. What's the matter?
- No!
Fuck off, Zoe! No!
Morning, Thomas.
- What happened?
- I had to leave.
Did you hear everything?
Yeah.
Did you know?
Did I know what?
That she knew... about your daughter.
You know, when the, when the police came to question me... they told me a lot of things.
They told me that my wife was having an affair with my brother;
Had been for years.
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.
They told me I thought she was Harold's.
Wh-Why would they say that?
Because they thought I could harm her... that I would harm her.
And then they found the man that... that did it.
Let me go.
And I went home.
And then my wife was killed in a car accident a couple months later.
And Harold was in the car.
He lived.
What do you think it would have taken... for your father to kill someone?
I'm asking because there's someone that I want to kill now.
I felt it last night as I listened to him in the washroom.
I don't understand.
He set me up... to touch her.
Why would he do that?
He took something very special from me.
I've had too many special things taken away.
- That's why we have to go back tonight.
- To kill him?
What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do?
Well...
- Well, I would talk to him.
- I can't even get in there.
What would you do?
You go back tonight... and you have her dance for you... and then you touch her.
And he'll throw you out just like he threw me out.
But I'll be waiting outside with the gun.
I'm not gonna help you kill somebody.
Not even to save a few years in prison?
No.
Well, to help me then?
And that was Mirella, gentlemen. Mirella.
You can have her at your own table for only five dollars.
Thank you, Mirella.
And now, it's always a pleasure to announce to you our next dancer.
Gentlemen, please, let's give a big round of applause... for Christina.
Don't be afraid.
I know everything about you.
What do you know about me?
I found her.
You found who?
Your little girl.
I found her, man.
I found her.
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.
Yeah. Hello.
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.
- Hi, Christina.
- Hi.
- I'm a little bit early.
- Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.
Yeah, I mean, it's difficult for me to tell...
'cause I never had much of a musical education myself... but her teacher thinks she's really talented.
And actually, we were thinking of buying her a better piano.
An exotic baby grand, you know?
And when I mentioned "baby grand," do you know what she said to me?
She said, "Dad, isn't that a contradiction in terms?"
I mean, she just never ceases to amaze me.
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when... it's two words, kind of cancel each other out?
She just amazes me.
Where's your mind?
I was just thinking.
About what?
About the way you talk about Lisa.
You get so excited.
It's nice.
Well, I'm sure your parents talk about you that way too.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do.
Why?
Because you're a very responsible young woman.
Responsible to what?
Well, to whatever it is you believe you have to do.
Like what?
Well, Lisa loves it when you come over to baby-sit, for example.
She says you really listen to her.
That's nice.
She really listens to me too.
She thinks you're not very happy.
Listen, Christina, if there's, if there's ever anything you want to talk about... about what might be going on at home or whatever... you know that I'm here, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, no. It's okay.
Thank you.
You know, I really enjoy these drives home, Mr. Brown.
Good, good. So do I.
- Bye, Mr. Brown.
- Good-bye.
2306, please.
Hello, honey.
How you doing?
Good.
What did he say?
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here, then I got a little meeting, and then I'll--
I would if I could.
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I-- let me get off and I prom--
I promise you it'll be okay.
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.
Hi, could I speak to Dr. Lowenstein, please?
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?
Bunch of bullshit trying to make a living on these deadbeat leads.
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today--
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda, this is Dave Moss.
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates, we've had a situation just come up.
The president of our company is in town just one day,
- and he has certain parcels--
- Doctor-- well, could you get-- what do you mean?
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.
He has certain parcels-- certain choice parcels which he's given me a hold on for the next 48 hours.
What would be the best time to get you and your husband together?
Say, tonight, at 10:00, or tomorrow at 8:00?
Okay.
Okay, what would be the best time to do that?
Look, you sent in the-- no, no, listen to me now--
I've got 48 hours to make you a lot of money.
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.
They don't give you the leads, they don't give you the support,
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.
Then they're yanking us in on some sales conference.
When's the last time anybody learned a goddamn thing?
All it does is some jerk shoots his mouth off.
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind to go across the street.
I got half a mind to go with you if they'd take me.
You never know-- I was talking to Jerry Graff last week.
I got to call these deadbeats back.
I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads, and you're killing my ass on the street.
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute, but you're running this office like a bunch of bullshit.
You're on an override-- you make money, we make money.
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.
- Shelly.
- John.
Are you ready to do or die tonight?
Oh yeah, always ready, John.
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing-- we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?
That's what we're going to talk about at the meeting.
We are? Because I'm running into a bit of a snag.
Yes, I've seen your sales figures.
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead--
That's what we're going to be talking about.
I'm in a bind-- personal problems.
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.
- I hear the new Glengarry leads--
- After the meeting, Shel.
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.
Cutty, Al.
- They say...
- Huh? they say it was so hot downtown this afternoon, grown men on the street corner were going up to cops begging the cops to shoot them.
They say you should not drink alcohol when it's so hot.
- Who says that?
- Something I read.
For they say it dehydrates you.
They say you should drink water, but I subscribe to the law of contrary public opinion.
If everyone thinks one thing, then I say bet the other way.
Added to which, you know they're wrong.
That's what I'm saying.
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, I guess everybody's staying home.
If my daughter calls, anybody calls,
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.
I had a woman in White Plains on the hook-- five units, Mountain View-- what happens?
She has to check with her lawyer.
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?
- I dunno.
- Shelly.
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?
Couldn't tell you.
I don't like the whole thing, because all I need is a lead.
- They won't give out--
- Uh-huh.
The rich get richer, that's the law of the land.
Who belongs to the BM--?
It is 7:30.
So who is that?
And where is
Mr. Roma?
Well, I'm not a leash, so I don't know, do I?
Let me have your attention for a moment.
You're talking about what?
You're talking about-- bitching about that sale you shot, some son of a bitch don't want to buy land, somebody don't want what you're selling, some broad you're trying to screw, so forth.
Let's talk about something important.
- Are they all here?
- All but one.
I'm going anyway.
Let's talk about something important.
Put that coffee down.
Coffee's for closers only.
You think
I'm fucking with you?
I am not fucking with you.
I'm here from downtown.
I'm here from Mitch and Murray.
And I'm here on a mission of mercy.
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.
You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch?
I don't got to listen to this shit.
You certainly don't, 'cause the good news is, you're fired.
The bad news is you've got-- all of you've got-- just one week to regain your jobs, starting with tonight-- starting with tonight's sit.
Oh, have I got your attention now?
Good...
'cause we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest.
As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado.
Anybody want to see second prize?
Second prize is a set of steak knives.
Third prize is you're fired.
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?
You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money.
Get their names to sell them.
You can't close the leads you're given, you can't close shit, you are shit!
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.
I've been in this business 15 years.
- What's your name?
- Fuck you-- that's my name!
You know why, mister?
Because you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight,
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.
And your name is "You're wanting."
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?
Then go home and tell your wife your troubles.
Because only one thing counts in this life-- get them to sign on the line which is dotted!
You hear me, you fucking fagots?
"A-B-C."
A-- Always,
B-- Be, C-- Closing.
Always Be Closing.
"Always Be Closing."
"A-I-D-A."
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."
Attention--
Do I have your attention?
Interest--
Are you interested?
I know you are, because it's fuck or walk.
You close or you hit the bricks.
Decision-- Have you made your decision for Christ?
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."
Get out there-- you got the prospects coming in.
You think they came in to get out of the rain?
A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy.
They're sitting out there waiting to give you their money.
Are you gonna take it?
Are you man enough to take it?
Crap.
What's the problem, pal?
You-- Moss.
You're such a hero, you're so rich, how come you're here wasting your time with a bunch of bums?
You see this watch?
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.
That watch costs more than your car.
I made $70,000 last year.
How much you make?
You see, pal... that's who I am, and you're nothing.
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.
Good father? Fuck you-- go home and play with your kids.
You want to work here-- close!
You think this is abuse?
You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?
You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get on a sit?
You don't like it, leave.
I can go out there tonight-- the materials you got-- make myself $15,000.
Tonight, in two hours!
Can you?
Can you?
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!
You know what it takes to sell real estate?
It takes brass balls to sell real estate.
Go and do likewise, gents.
The money's out there you pick it up, it's yours, you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.
You want to go out on those sits tonight and close close, it's yours.
Not, you're gonna be shining my shoes.
And you know what you'll be saying.
Bunch of losers sitting around in a bar,
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."
These are the new leads.
These are the Glengarry leads.
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.
Why?
Because to give them to you is just throwing them away.
They're for closers.
I'd wish you good luck, but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it.
And to answer your question, pal--
"Why am I here?"
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor-- follow my advice and fire your fucking ass, because a loser is a loser."
Bunch of fucking nonsense-- treat people like that.
The fuck is he going to get off?
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.
I'm sure he didn't mean it about trimming down the sales quota.
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?
All the while we got to sit here, eat this nonsense?
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.
I think-- I know she is.
I know that she is.
I've gotta go out. Will you please tell her when she wakes?
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, you heard the man.
What is this in aid of?
- As of tonight--
- What is this? Excuse me.
What it's in aid of is that Mitch and Murray--
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,
I got to put up with this childishness?
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!
Two lead cards for tonight, two lead cards for tomorrow.
As you heard, end of the month, top salesman on the board gets the Eldorado.
- Next man down the--
- What about the good leads?
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.
They're old--
I've seen that name 100 times.
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?
The new leads-- the Glengarry leads.
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.
And they'll be assigned to closers, based on the sales volume, first to Roma.
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.
He'll get his leads, you've got yours.
He's top name on the board, so he don't have to be here?
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,
I suggest you-- those of you who are interested in a continuing job with this organization, get to work.
That's garbage.
Bullshit.
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.
I-- I can't--
I can't close this stuff.
Shelly, how am I supposed to--
They're going to bounce me out of a job.
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?
Yeah, this is George Aaronow.
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.
Yes. I'm calling from the airport, and consulting my map,
I see that you and your wife live near the airport.
I have some rather-- rather unusual, rather good information on the property...
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.
Please listen closely--
I only have a moment or so.
I can speak only to a Mrs. Nyborg.
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.
Our computer has chosen you from all of the many thousands who write in requesting information on our properties.
Now by federal law, as you probably know, the prize must be awarded to you even if you are not engaged in our land development plan.
The only stipulation, of course, is that you and your husband must sign at the same time for the receipt of your prize.
Now, I will be in the area tonight, possibly tomorrow.
What do you think might be a convenient time to meet with both you and your husband?
Of course I'll hold.
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.
They're ancient-- a bunch of fucking nonsense.
Get some jerk to come in here--
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."
Send a guy out there-- no support, no confidence.
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma-- fuck Roma.
Had a freak-- a little run of luck.
The leads are garbage.
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.
What is it?
I can't push through.
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.
- Something in me.
- Forget it.
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.
I can't close 'em.
Life.
I swear to God, you work all your life--
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.
The thing of it is, money's tight.
When times are tight, it don't do no good to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."
Threaten a man all you want, you can't whip a dead horse.
- Nope.
- All this garbage--
"Sell 10,000, you win a Cadillac; you lose, we're gonna fire your ass"? It's medieval.
- Yes.
- It's wrong.
- Yes.
- Yes it is, and you know who's responsible?
- Who?
- You know who it is.
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.
He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got that list-- with the nurses?
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office, telling us, "Get out there and close, go win a Cadillac."
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.
- You see?
- Yes.
For the leads-- that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.
Who-- who's got a steady job, a regular job, a couple of bucks nobody's touched?
Nurses.
Graff goes and buys a fucking list of nurses. One grand-- he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.
- He's going wild.
- He is?
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.
- The nurses?
- Yeah.
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.
All that shit. Somebody told me-- you know what he's clearing, himself?
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.
He's got the good leads.
What are we?
We're sitting in the shit here. Why?
Because we got to go to them to get them.
90% of our sales we're paying to the office for the leads.
There's our leads, there's overhead, phones, a lot of stuff.
What do you need?
A telephone?
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.
The whole thing is the leads, you understand me?
You can't sell to a void-- you got to get a goddamn person.
You get a lead, you get a person-- I'll go sell 'em.
Otherwise, what do they want from my life?
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.
Yeah, we spoke-- last May I called you.
I was in town from my estate in Rio Rancho, and--
Arizona.
I wish we could have gotten together at that time.
Danny, that piece of property I had for you has increased in value--
Grace, Grace, what was that figure? $76,000.
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have been in on it with me.
Look, I'm here overnight--
I have to go home tomorrow, and I thought, after the interest you showed on the last trip, that--
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious, and because of that, I am going to shove my appointments around and make sure-- oh, gee, I wish that--
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.
Going out tonight,
Shelly?
What is this bullshit with the sales promotion?
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.
You're going to fire the bottom men on the list?
That's the way it is and I don't make the rules.
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy-- five minutes?
I am trying to get home for two hours.
I got to go home, grab one hour with my kids, come back here, see if any of you closed a contract, take the contract--
- How about one minute?
- What is it?
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.
Don't jump! Don't jump out of your manager bag a second.
It's just two guys talking, am I right? We're just talking.
You got the new leads.
If you would give me-- just hold on.
The Glengarry leads are to be assigned only to closers.
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads--
You blew the last good one
I gave you.
No, no-- hold on, will you?
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.
Shelly--
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.
I pray you never find it-- it runs in streaks.
That's what it's doing, that's all it does-- streaks.
I pray that it misses you and that's all I have to say.
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson-- look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets. six months in '89, who's on top?
- Roma.
- Under him?
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!
April to September it's me-- it's no fucking Moss.
Due respect, he's an order-taker.
Talk-- talks a good game, but look on the board, it's me.
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late--
Well, lately-- kiss my ass "lately."
You call Murray and you call Mitch-- when we were on Peterson, who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?
He came in here--
"You bought that for me, fella."
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?
You are really beginning to burn my ass, kid.
I can't get a lead, you-- it was skill, John.
It could be working for you-- you want to throw it away.
- It isn't me.
- It's not you--
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.
Bullshit,
"After the contest."
If I'm not on that board by the 30th, they're going to can my ass.
I need those leads and I need 'em now or I'm out.
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.
Let me tell you something, Shelly.
I do what I'm hired to do-- you might do the same.
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!
I'm hired to watch the leads, to marshal my sales force.
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.
Marshal your sales force?
Anybody falls below a certain mark, I'm directed.
I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
How do they rise above that mark? With dreck?
With this toilet paper you're giving me?
You give me one premium lead--
Do you know what the premium leads cost?
Do I know what the premium leads cost?
Yeah,
I know what they cost.
I generated the sufficient dollar revenue to buy them.
But I cannot sell shit!
Jesus. And I've seen these before, you know.
Christ, I saw these back--
Homestead--
1985, we pitched these cocksuckers Baywater.
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.
Just give me some leads that don't come out of a phone book.
You give me something hotter than that and I can close it.
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.
Hey, I need your help.
I can't do it,
Shelly.
John...
I'll give you 10%.
- Of what?
- My end-- what I close.
You give me the premium leads, you're in for 10%, what I close.
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.
What if you don't, you understand?
Then I'm fucked. You think you're the only guy with a family?
- You see what I'm saying?
- John--
I step out and you don't close, then it's my job.
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!
Now, 10% John--
I can get hot, you know that.
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist-- fuck it!
Go with me. Get on my side and let's do something.
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said--
"Attack."
Let's do something.
- Huh?
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.
- No?
- Oh!
Oh, shit.
Listen...
I got to talk to you.
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.
A man acquires a reputation on the street.
What he does when he's up, what he does at other times...
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."
Now you want to throw this 50-buck thing in.
John, a good deal-- has got to be one where both parties--
Okay, okay, okay, fine--
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.
Let's go out.
We make some money.
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight and I want the good leads-- the Glengarry leads-- two.
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.
It's a long road with no turning, pally.
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.
I've got to go back to the office to get 'em.
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.
All you need, a little boost, you turn a streak around.
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?
What?
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.
You fucking asshole.
I don't have it--
I don't--
I'll bring it in the office in the morning.
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.
I can't fucking believe this.
All right, here's...
20... 30, and--
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!
No.
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,
I'd pick up the phone and call Murray-- I got your job.
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.
Bought him a trip to Bermuda once.
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.
Give me-- I'll take two more of the old leads.
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly--
I promise you,
I've been on the phone-- I know.
No more leads today-- two per day. You've got yours.
All right.
- All right?
- Sure.
We will do that... other thing.
I guess I left my wallet in my room.
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?
- To get on the--
- To get on the board, yeah.
How am I gonna get on the board trying to sell a doctor?
Two regular, two chocolate donuts.
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.
I will never try to sell an Indian.
These names come up-- you ever get 'em-- "Patel"?
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.
You had one, you'd know it-- "Patel."
They keep coming up.
I don't know.
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.
They like to feel superior-- never bought a fucking thing.
I don't know.
Come down the line-- doctors, lawyers, Indians-- times are tight. It's tight.
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.
You go in the door-- I got to close this fucker or I don't eat lunch, or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.
Remember when we were-- when we were selling Glen Ross Farms?
Didn't we sell a bunch of that?
- They came in--
- They fucked it up.
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...
- We're stuck with this--
- Stuck with this fucking shit.
- This shit.
- It's too...
- It is.
- You get a bad month-- they put you on this board.
Some contest board.
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.
I know, it's-- hey. What did I learn as a kid on Western?
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.
Guys come in-- "Oh, the blah, blah, blah. I know what I'll do.
I'll go out and rob everybody blind and go to Argentina
'cause nobody ever thought of this before."
So they kill the goose and the man's worked all his life--
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots--
Boots, yes...
For some fucking "Sell 10,000, win the steak knives."
- What do you do?
- What can you do?
What can you do if you don't have the leads?
If you do not have the goddamn leads!
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.
I was speaking to your wife earlier?
Come in.
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.
Oh, "cats and dogs."
Oh, I see you're interested in fishing.
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself-- many years.
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?
I spoke to your wife earlier on the phone.
I called, I'm in town with Rio Rancho.
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had some sort of award?
Yes, I was speaking to the people in my sales organization-- my representatives in this area-- and Mr. Spannel-- your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant, and he made me-- he made me an offer.
He offered me $230,000 to promote a sales plan-- to present investment opportunities in Rio Rancho to the public.
Well, I said, "Hell, let me save you the 230, and pass the savings along to the investor."
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?
How can you present investment opportunities without television, without magazine ads?"
I said, "You take something this good, you go to a man-- has invested in the past-- you go to him direct and offer the money to him-- rebate.
And don't give it to this expert."
So you're here to sell me some land?
No, I wouldn't try to sell you--
I leave that to the salesmen and people who want to own land.
I think something has to be fed, watered and painted, but don't invest in it.
That motto has stood me in good stead.
- Mister--
- Just call me Shelly.
I have never been afraid of familiarity.
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the--
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.
Spoke to the little woman on the phone-- can't wait to meet her.
No, we're going over to our relatives'.
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.
- I'm on a plane to Florida--
- I'm sorry if we put you out.
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.
You know, that's the only parcel that I've got.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're gonna speak to your relatives, too.
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.
My God, I'm in the act of giving a gift away.
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.
I have nothing. She took the call without my knowledge.
I have no business that I wish to transact.
I don't want to tell you how to handle your wife.
My wife filled in a form, and we have been plagued for the last year--
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.
No, no.
Do you understand?
Thank you. No.
- Roma, man-- he don't care.
- He don't care.
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.
If they bounce you with no confidence--
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.
If they get you on a bad beat-- and you got to go out there, get a new job--
- With no--
- With no confidence--
Yes.
I'll tell you what the hard part is-- to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.
You say the Nazis in Europe--
"If they came in my door"-- bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker-- wants to break your rice bowl.
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say-- fuck you!
Sitting on the good leads.
George, we're men here.
Yes.
And I'll tell you--
I'll tell you what the hard part is.
- What?
- Starting up.
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit, this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.
This is the difference-- listen to me, George.
Now Jerry Graff went into business for himself.
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?
I'll tell you-- I'll tell you what somebody should do.
What?
Somebody should stand up and strike back.
Somebody should do something to them.
- What?
- Something to pay them back.
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Someone should do something
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.
If we were that kind of guy to hold up the joint and trash it, it looks like robbery, we take the leads out of the files and we go to Jerry Graff.
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.
I'd like to speak to you about awarding you your prize.
We're coming to the end of our fiscal year,
I'd really like to get it off the books before-- yes, the prize for Consolidated Properties.
The information you requested on Rio Rancho.
Now, I'm in town only for-- well, let me see.
I suppose I could swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.
When do you think it might be more convenient?
As I said,
I could swing by tonight-- well, of course, you speak to your wife.
Grace, I'm gonna need a first-class seat, passport, 10,000 in cash, put that with the negotiable papers, if you would.
And put me on the telex hookup-- yes?
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?
All train compartments smell vaguely of shit.
It gets so you don't mind it.
That's the worst thing that I can confess.
You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.
When you die you're gonna regret the things you don't do.
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?
You get befuddled by a middle-class morality?
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.
You cheat on your wife, you did it. Live with it.
You fuck little girls, so be it.
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.
And then what?
If you think there is, go ahead, be that thing.
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.
You think that, act that way.
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.
That's me.
Did you ever take a dump, made you feel like you slept for 12 hours?
- Did I...?
- Yes.
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?
Great meals fade in reflection.
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us, keeps us going-- it's only food.
The great fucks you may have had, what do you remember about them?
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
For me,
I'm saying what it is, it's probably not the orgasm.
Some broad's forearm on your neck, something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.
Or it's me in the--
I'm telling you--
I'm in bed the next day, she brought me café au lait, gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.
Eh?
What I'm saying, what is our life?
Our life is looking forward or it's looking back.
That's it.
That's our life.
Where's the moment?
And what is it we're so afraid of?
Loss. What else?
The bank closes, we get sick, my wife died on a plane?
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?
What could we get for them?
- For them?
- For the leads.
What could we get for the leads?
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.
You're saying a fella could take those leads and sell them to Graff?
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying-- yeah.
A guy could take-- like anything else, it seems to me, that is negotiable, a guy could sell them.
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.
Are you just talking about this, or are we just talking about it?
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.
As a robbery? No.
- Well...
- Hey.
So all this-- you didn't actually call Graff?
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.
- Did you?
- What did I say?
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.
- We are?
- Yes.
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.
It is a crime.
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.
- Have I said that?
- Are you?
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?
- What did I say?
- What did he say?
What did he say?
He'd buy them.
You're gonna steal-- you're gonna steal the Glengarry leads and sell them to Graff?
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?
He figures there's 500 leads, let's say 10 bucks apiece,
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.
You and me for one night's work, and a job with Graff
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?
He could take you on.
Yes.
Hello?
I was dialing the direct line to my daughter's room.
Sheldon Levene.
She's in-- well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But-- where's the duty nurse?
They canceled her-- well, let me talk-- who am I speaking to?
I'll have the money there tomorrow.
It's a big decision,
George.
At times a guy has got to make one.
It's a big decision and it's a big reward.
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward for one night's work.
Yes.
Sometimes a guy... sometimes, a man if he wants a reward--
That's absolutely right.
He'll do one thing, one thing on one night.
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.
What?
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?
They bring those leads up, wave them under your nose, tomorrow they take them downtown, parcel them out.
A guy wants those leads, he's gonna have to get them tonight.
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.
It's when a chance presents itself.
You got to go in there tonight.
- You.
- I'm sorry?
- You.
- Me?
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.
Yes?
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
- Yes.
- No.
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.
Let me ask you this-- are you going to turn me in?
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, are you going to turn me in?
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
Uh-huh. George... when they come to me, if I have to go in there, and if I get caught--
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.
- Why?
- Why?
Are you going to give me $7,500?
75? I thought we were splitting five grand.
I lied, all right? Your end is 25, my end is my own concern.
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,
I'm caught, they're going to ask me who were accomplices.
- Me.
- Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
To the law, you're an accessory before the fact.
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave?
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.
Just in or out?
You tell me.
You're out, you take the consequences.
- I do?
- That's right.
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?
You know, I hate to keep calling you this late, Bruce, but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have--
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."
- Huh?
- The thing.
You really... what do you keep?
I mean, you don't keep anything, really.
- No.
- Security.
Things. Things.
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.
It's just... you try to stave off insecurity.
You can't do it.
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.
Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate, what are they?
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.
To indulge and to learn about ourselves? Perhaps.
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.
That's all they are.
They're an event.
A guy comes to you, you make a call. You send in a card,
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?
You see what I'm saying?
Things happen to you.
Glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you,
James.
I want to show you something.
It may mean something to you, it may not.
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.
What is that?
Florida.
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.
And that's what I said.
But look at this.
What is this?
This is a piece of land.
Listen to what I'm going to tell you now.
- What happened?
- Where do you work?
I work, yes.
I work here.
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.
Williamson. Williamson, did they get the contracts?
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?
They got-- excuse me.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?
They got-- listen to me.
They got some of them.
- Some of them?
- Who told you?
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?
We got a fucking board up on the window.
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.
Now, leave me a second here, please.
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.
- So far--
- Talk to me. Talk to me.
They got some of the contracts?
Lingk. James Lingk, which I closed last night.
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?
- James Lingk?
- Yes.
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?
Then I'm over the fucking top, you owe me a Cadillac.
- I don't--
- I don't want to hear any shit.
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.
- The robbery makes difficult--
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!
See, 'cause this is how we keep score, "bubby."
You told me, "Close thus, and so you get the car."
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!
"Recontact James Lingk.
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.
When do you expect her in?
This is Ricky Roma from last night.
She'll remember.
Just, just-- wait a minute!
Just to say-- to thank her for a wonderful time.
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.
They should check if we're insured.
Uh-huh.
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.
I-- you know, they should be insured.
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.
That's right.
How are you?
I'm fine.
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?
Yes. Okay.
The board.
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't--
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't--
What?
You can't do what?
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.
Look, look at this shit they're giving you. Huh?
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View, the fucking things get stolen.
- He said he filed--
- He filed the big one.
He filed the guy from the bar that I closed last night.
All the little ones,
I got to go back.
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.
I mean, talk about a fucking beat that would sap anyone's-- wait, wait, wait. Where are the phones?
- They stole--
- They stole...?
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.
...when criminals come and they take-- they steal the phones?
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones, they stole-- aw, Christ.
What am I going to do this month? Shit.
You think they're going to catch-- where are you going?
Down the street.
- Where are you going?
- To the-- what do you fucking care?
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.
Great.
Give them to me.
Bring them.
Come on.
Fucking Mitch and Murray are going to shit a--
What am I going to do all month?
See, the thing of it is, is were the leads insured?
You think?
- What?
- Were the leads insured?
I don't know, why?
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...
- What?
- They'll be upset.
That's right.
You're right.
He said we're all going to have to talk to the guy.
- To...
- The cop.
Great. We have to talk to the cop.
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?
Why? 'Cause they're not going to find the guy.
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.
The cops aren't going to find the guy?
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?
- Where were you?
- Where was I?
- Yeah.
- I was at home.
- Where were you?
- At home.
See? Were you the guy who broke in?
- Was I?
- Yes.
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?
- No. Who?
- Thieves.
I don't know what I'm going to tell them.
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.
It's the easiest thing to remember.
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?
"Ravidam Patel"?
How am I going to make a living on these deadbeats?
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm--
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,
I'm busting my balls to sell your dirt to deadbeats-- money in the mattress.
I come back, you can't even keep the contracts safe.
I got to go out-- fuck this shit.
I'm going to go out and re-close last week's stuff.
No, the word from Murray is leave them alone.
If he needs a new sig, he'll go out himself.
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company just in from out of town," all right?
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.
Fucking Shiva handed this guy a million dollars, told him, "Sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.
And the god Vishnu, too, into the bargain. Fuck you.
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.
If I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm gonna go to him and figure out a way to have your ass-- fuck you!
I'm waiting for the new leads.
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!
Get the--
I did it-- I closed 'em.
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!
Williamson, pick up the fucking chalk.
- Rick-- eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?
Who wants to go to lunch,
I'm buying.
Williamson, $82,000
12 grand in my commission.
On deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.
Read it.
What the hell happened here?
Fuck! I had them on River Glen.
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.
- Eight units!
- Yeah.
- Shelly!
- Big deal-- I broke a bad streak.
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.
Thank you, George.
Hey--
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.
- Huh?
- Aaronow?
They took the leads, the cash, the contracts.
- We had a robbery.
- When?
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?
Fucking asshole.
What? They beat you with a rubber bat?
Cop couldn't find his dick with two hands and a map.
Anybody who talks to this asshole is a fucking asshole.
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.
I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here.
- Anybody talks to this guy--
- Guess what "The Machine" did.
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.
Cop's got no right to talk to me that way. I did not rob the place.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.
Eight units,
Mountain View.
- You did that?
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?
- When?
- Just now.
- Guess who?
- You just-- this morning?
Harriett and blah blah Nyborg.
- You did that?
- Yeah $82,000.
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em-- listen to this.
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.
I said, "You have to believe in yourself."
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.
- Why not?
- They took 'em.
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn--
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.
But why? Why don't I get the opportunities?"'
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.
Could we get some coffee?
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
Uh-huh.
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?
I got 'em in the kitchen, eating their crumb cake--
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,
You haven't closed a good one in a month.
None of my business, you want to push me to answer you.
So you haven't got a contract to get stolen and so forth.
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you, and what are you babbling about?
You bring that shit up-- on my volume?
If you were on a bad one and I brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.
You'd harbor it a long while and you'd be right.
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.
- Shut up!
- Okay...
You want to decide who should be dealt with how, is that it?
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.
I get accused of--
I get shit thrown in my face because you're top name on the board?
Is that what I did, Dave--
I humiliated you?
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.
Sitting on top of the world-- everything's fucking peach fuzz.
I don't get a moment to spare for some bust-out humanitarian
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!
Fuck you, Dave-- you know you got a big mouth.
You make a close, this whole place stinks with your farts for a week-- how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!
"Let me buy you a pack of gum--
I'll show you how to chew it."
Your pal closes, and all that comes out of your mouth is bile.
How fucked-up you are!
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?
Big deal!
Fuck you!
You got the memory of a fucking fly!
I never liked you, anyway.
What is this, your farewell speech?
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!
You were saying?
Huh?
Come on.
Come on-- you got 'em in the kitchen, you're in your shirtsleeves, you got the stats spread out, you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.
- How was it?
- From the store.
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett... we have to admit to ourselves that we see that opportunity and take it-- and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."
God, that's what
I've been saying-- the old ways.
Convert that motherfucker, sell him, make him sign the check.
They got their money in government bonds--
I said, "Fuck it-- let's go all the way, the whole route."
I take it and plat it out-- eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,
"This is now. This is that thing that you have been dreaming of.
You are going to find the suitcase on the train.
The man walks in the room, that bag is filled with money.
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce--
I don't want to fuck around with you.
No, I don't. I don't want to pussyfoot around.
You think you got to look back on this thing? I do, too.
Now, I'm here to do good for you and me-- the both of us.
What is the point of some interim position?
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.
And I mean it, that's it-- all eight units. Period."
Now I got the pen in my hand, Rick-- hey.
I turned that contract around-- that's eight units, 82 grand-- and I said,
"I want you to sign."
I sat there five minutes.
Then I sat 22 minutes by that kitchen clock on the wall.
Ricky-- not a word, not a motion.
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"
No. I did it.
Just like the old days, like I used to, like I was taught.
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.
Nobody ever-- well, if I did, I'm glad.
No, what I did--
I locked on 'em.
I locked all on them-- nothing on me-- on them.
And, oh God, I am holding my last thought,
"Now is the time."
They signed.
It was great.
It was so fucking great.
It was like they wilted all at once.
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing-- just together.
Honest to God, they both imperceptibly slumped.
And then he reached and he took the pen and he signed, passed it to her and she signed.
It was solemn-- fucking solemn.
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce," then I pointed into the living room to the sideboard.
I didn't know there was a sideboard in there.
He went over, he brought us back a drink-- little shot glasses with a pretty design in 'em.
And we just toasted in silence.
Great sale, Shelly.
Great.
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.
I talked to Mitch and Murray an hour ago. They're coming in.
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele--
I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.
We had a little-- you closed the deal, you made a good sale. Fine.
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make--
All I'm telling you is, you can tell them it was a remarkably good sale.
The only thing remarkable about it is who you made it to.
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.
Do you know that?
A man is his job!
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?
Your "End of the Month" fucking boar-- you do not know how to run this office.
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?
- Did you ever sit--
- If I were you, I would calm down.
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?
I got up early this morning, tracked 'em down, and closed it.
What I'm saying to you is that things change.
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?
Maybe it's someone else, but you don't know-- you can't look back, because you don't know your history!
When we were on Rio Rancho, who was the top man, huh?
For what, two months, three months?
How about eight months, for three years in a row!
Luck-- was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?
- It was talent!
- Yes.
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.
Soft sell-- we were doing it before we had a name for it.
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.
You wouldn't know, you cock-- he doesn't even know what a streak is.
What the hell are you?
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!
That's my message to you-- fuck you, and kiss my ass.
If you don't like that, I go across the street and speak to Jerry Graff.
Period. Fuck you.
Listen to me-- you put me on that fucking board, and I want three promising leads for today,
I don't want any bullshit, and I want 'em close together, because I am going to close them all.
And that's all I have to say to you.
He's right, Williamson.
I'm sorry, but it's wrong, and you know whose fault it is?
Mitch and Murray.
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?
The leads won't be up here till later anyway.
You're a client. I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.
I do this with my hair, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.
I put her into it.
You look on the plats when you go home. You'll see...
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.
- Take your time. If you still feel--
- I won't need more time, Rick.
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.
Jim, what are you doing here?
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.
- Are you acquainted with--
- Black Creek? No.
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.
My wife suggested
I look into it.
Beautiful rolling land--
I was telling Jim and Jinny.
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services-- what I'm saying is, you haven't had a meal until you've tasted--
I was at the Lingks'-- what was that service feature you were talking about?
- Which--
- "Home cooking."
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...
"Home cook--" the monthly interview.
- The magazine!
- Yes.
Is that something
I can talk about?
It won't be out until the February issue, but go ahead.
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.
Ray was eating at one of his company men's homes in France.
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.
His wife.
Ray, what time do you have?
- I got to get you on the plane.
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.
Remember the 1:00-- that's why we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
You're right, the 1:00-- let's scoot.
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle-- John!
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.
Christ, I'm sorry you came all the way in.
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and-- no, I can't. I'm meeting your man at the bank.
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?
- I don't know.
- Rick?
- What?
- Kenilworth?
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray-- just a minute.
Jim, I told you who he is-- the senior vice-president of American Express.
His family owns 32 per-- over the past years, I have sold him--
I can't tell you the dollar amount-- but quite a lot of land.
I promised him five weeks ago that I would go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?
They treat me like a member of the family. I have to go.
It's funny-- you get a picture of the corporation-type company man, all business-- this guy, I'll tell you.
We'll go to his house someday.
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?
Ah, Monday.
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?
- My wife--
- Rick?
I can't talk now, Jim--
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
That's a common reaction, Jim, and let me tell you what it is.
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.
Monday, you invite me to dinner again--
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law-- the man next to you-- bought his lot at 42-- phoned to say he already had an offer.
- Rick.
- I'm coming.
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.
I'm sorry you had to come all the way in. Monday lunch.
- We have to go.
- Monday!
She called the consumer-- the attorney general?
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?
The attorney ge-- it was some consumer office.
Why'd she do that, Jim?
I don't know.
But they said we have three days.
They said we got three days, yeah.
Three days?
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.
Of course you have-- three days.
So we can't talk Monday.
Monday-- you saw my book.
Jim, Jim-- I can't.
You saw my book.
I can't.
We have to before Monday to get our money back.
Three business days, they mean.
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business-- if we wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday-- so it would have elapsed.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Monday it would have elapsed!
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
- I don't know.
- Today.
Today. Which, in any case, it was not-- there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.
It wasn't cashed?
I just phoned downtown-- it's on their desk.
- Rick.
- One moment.
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,
I can't talk to you about it here.
- Levene!
- Listen to me.
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.
In fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it.
So quite the opposite.
It says,
"You can change your mind three 'working days' from the time the deal was closed."
- Levene!
- Wait a second!
Which is not until the check is cashed!
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.
- I didn't rob--
- Shelly, get in the office.
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?
I work here! I didn't come in here to be mistreated!
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.
Where does he get off talking that way to a working man?
Take it outside. We have people trying to do business.
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.
I meet Gestapo tactics!
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.
No man has the right-- no man has the right--
"Call an attorney"-- that means you're under-- he says, "Cooperate or we'll take you downtown."
That's not-- as long as I've--
Will you get out of here?
Will you get out of here?
Will you?
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?
Will you excuse me, please?
I'm sorry, I--
I apologize to you. It's--
It's not me, it's my wife.
What is it?
- I told you.
- Tell me again.
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again-- your wife?
- I told you.
- Tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're gonna speak to her.
No, she told me,
"Right now."
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.
- She--
- Roma!
She said if don't get my money back, to call the state's attorney.
No. No.
This is something she said.
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.
- No, Jim.
- I do.
Listen, I do-- if I don't get my money back--
Roma,
I'm talking to you.
Listen-- will someone get this guy off my back, please?
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.
I will be with you in a while, got it?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
This is me!
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.
Jim, anything you want, you want it, you got it.
Understand?
This is me.
Something upset you.
Yes.
Sit down now.
Sit down.
You tell me what it is, am I gonna help you fix it?
You're goddamned right I am.
Sit down.
I'll tell you something, sometimes we need someone from outside.
Sit. Talk to me, come on.
I can't negotiate.
What does that mean?
What?
What?
Say the words.
I don't have the power.
Okay, I said it.
- What power?
- To negotiate.
To negotiate what?
To negotiate what?
This.
- What this?
- The deal.
The deal?
Forget the deal, Jim.
You got something on your mind, what is it?
What?
I can't talk to you.
You met my wife.
- What?
- Aw...
I met your wife, what?
What, Jim?
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.
Get a drink, come on.
No, no, she told me not to talk to you.
Come on, we're gonna go around the corner.
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?
She told me to get the check back, otherwise--
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.
Am I talking about the deal?
That's over.
Please-- let's talk about you.
I'm gonna tell you something.
Your life is your own.
You have a contract with your wife, you have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there.
And there are other things, and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.
You needn't feel that you're being untrue or that she would abandon you if she knew.
This is your life.
Yes?
Now, I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset, and that concerns me.
Let's go, come on, right now.
Let's go, come on.
Roma.
- What?
- The check, it's--
What did I tell you?
No, what did I tell you about the three days?
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.
I am talking with Mr. Lingk, if you please.
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.
- People downtown said--
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!
Yes?
Mr. Lingk and I are going to go to the--
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be--
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John--
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?
- Mr. Williamson--
- The check was cashed.
The contract was filed and deposited in the bank, and we're completely insured in any case, as you know.
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.
- Though I'm sure we can--
- Not to my knowledge.
Christ! I--
Oh, Christ.
Don't follow me, just don't follow me, okay?
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I--
I don't--
I don't know anymore.
I... forgive me.
You stupid fucking cunt.
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.
You just cost me $6,000.
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do about it, asshole?
You're fucking shit.
Where did you learn your trade, you stupid fucking cunt, you idiot?
Who ever told you that you could work with men?
Could I...?
Oh, I'm gonna have your job, shithead.
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on, you're going out.
I swear to you--
Hey, fella, let's get this done.
Anyone in this office lives on his wits--
I'm gonna be with you in a second.
What you're hired for is to help us.
Does that seem clear to you?
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!
To help men who are going out there to try to earn a living, you fairy.
You company man.
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.
I can tell our friend here something, might help him to catch you.
You wanna learn the first rule you'd know if you ever spent a day in your life?
You never open your mouth till you know what the shot is.
You fucking child.
You are a shithead,
Williamson.
Can't think on your feet, you ought to keep your mouth closed.
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.
Yes, I hear you.
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office, gotta learn it in the street.
And you sure can't buy it, you gotta live it.
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!
Precisely.
Because your partner depends--
I'm talking to you, trying to tell you something!
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,
"Hey, maybe the guy--" oh, fuck it.
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.
The man who is your partner, depends on you.
You go with him and for him or you're shit!
You are shit-- you can't exist alone.
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man out of $6,000 and his goddamned bonus because you didn't know the shot.
You can do that and you're not man enough to say it gets you?
I don't know what-- if you can't take something from that, then you're-- scum!
You're fucking white bread.
A child would know it, he's right.
If you're gonna make something up, be sure that it helps.
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.
I'm done with you.
How do you know
I made it up?
What?
How do you know
I made it up?
What are you talking about, huh?
You said, "Don't make something up unless it's sure to help."
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?
I told the customer his contract had gone to the bank.
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?
No, it hadn't.
Don't fuck with me.
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?
I'm saying this, Shelly... usually I take the contracts to the bank, last night I didn't.
Last night I stayed home with my kids.
How did you know that?
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.
No one knew that but you.
Now, how did you know that?
You want to talk to me or you want to talk to someone else?
Because this is my job!
This is my job on the line and you are gonna talk to me!
Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
You are so full of shit!
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.
Oh sure! You asshole.
What did you do with the leads?
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know, he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?
If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.
If you don't, I'm gonna tell the cop you stole them.
Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail, believe me, they will!
Now, where are the leads?
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.
I don't care, you understand?
Where are the leads?
All right.
I sold them.
To Jerry Graff.
How much did you get for them?
How much did you get for them?
Five.
Five grand.
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?
Do I have to tell you?
Moss.
Well, that was easy, wasn't it?
- His idea.
- Was it?
I think he got more than five, actually.
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.
Mmm.
Wait a minute.
Okay-- hey, hey, John!
Wait-- okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.
Listen.
Come here, come here.
Eh, John?
Last night...
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.
Hey-- put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.
What it taught me-- you gotta get out there!
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.
And I am back.
I got my balls back.
Now... you got a slight advantage on me.
But whatever it takes, John, to make things right, we're gonna make it right.
We are going to make it right.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.
What?
You've got a big mouth!
And now I'm gonna show you an even bigger one.
Where are you going?
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
It's $2,500. Go ahead and take it, take it all.
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.
I think you fucked up my office, and I think you're going away.
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take--
I'm gonna make this office and be number one on that board again.
Wait, John.
John-- okay.
This is what we're gonna do-- 20%.
I'm gonna give you 20% of all my sales.
20%, as long as I'm with this firm.
- 50% of all my sales.
- What sales?
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg-- do you want to see the memos?
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week-- when I was with Webb-- we were selling Arizona.
They're nuts.
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.
The check is no good?
They're nuts?
You want to call the bank?
I called them.
I called them four months ago when we first got the lead.
The people are insane.
They just like talking to salesmen.
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.
My daughter.
Fuck you.
Asshole.
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch in the living room.
What a day.
Whoo...
I haven't even had a cup of coffee.
Jag-off John opens his mouth, blows my Cadillac.
I swear, it's not a world of men.
It is not a world of men, "Machine."
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers... bureaucrats... officeholders, what it is.
It's a fucked-up world.
No adventure to it.
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's-- that's-- that's why we got to stick together. Shel?
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.
I've wanted to talk to you for some time-- for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"-- there's a man
I would work with.
There's--" you know,
I never said a word.
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.
And that shit you were slinging on my guy today-- that was so good.
That-- it-- excuse me for saying this, it's not even my place to say it.
That was admirable.
It was the old stuff.
Hey, I've been on a hot streak.
So what?
Things I can learn from you.
- You eat today?
- Me?
Yeah.
Want to swing around the Chinks'-- watch me eat, we'll talk?
I think
I'll stay around awhile.
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?
This is Richard Roma with Premiere Properties.
You or your accountant requested information on a land investment which would offer you depreciation and the chance of a substantial return on a small investment.
I'm in from Florida just for one day...
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.
Would you come in here, please?
I don't have too much time and I'm on the midnight plane back, so if you or your husband are truly interested-- because I can't hold this parcel past--
Yes?
Well, what would be better for you-- say, 6:00 or 8:00?
Go ask him. Shel-- we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.
- I...
- Get in the room.
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky--
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is--
What do you want?
You want to what?
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.
8:00 p.m.
6947 Euclid.
Not at all-- thank you very much.
They find the guy that broke in the office?
No. I don't know.
Did the leads come in yet?
No.
Oh God,
I hate this job.
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?
Yes, you requested some information about Rio Rancho Properties?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.
What do you want?
I thought you were...
What?
I don't know.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Stop!
- What? What?
- It's okay. Come here.
It's okay. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.
What was in there?
Just gimme a minute to figure things out.
- Why were you afraid of that room?
- Gimme a minute I said.
How many people are in this thing?
Listen. We can't go climbing around in here.
Why not?
- There are traps.
- What do you mean traps?
Booby traps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my head off.
Holy cats. Holy, holy cats.
You alright? Mister?
Worth!
Don't worry.
I hit my head.
Let me take a look at that.
I'm a doctor. It doesn't look that bad.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, old man, did you hear what I said?
Motion detectors. Integrated into the walls. Tough to spot.
Oh god, oh god, oh god.
Wait a second.
Let's all just relax for a minute.
Does anybody remember how they got here?
Perogies.
I was eating dinner.
Perogies. Cheese and potatoes.
I ran out of sour cream and then
I went to the fridge and then...
I don't know.
You? Leaven?
I, I just went to bed and...
What about you?
I just woke up here.
Middle of the night.
It's like Chile. They always come in the middle of the night.
Who?
Only the goverment could build something this ugly.
It ain't government.
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.
Aliens.
Please.
We're spooked enough as it is.
Let's rule out aliens for now and concentrate on what we know.
My mom's gonna freak.
Rennes?
- I just won't be there. They'll freak.
- What do you think, Rennes?
We won't solve jack shit sittin' still.
I'm moving in a straight line
'till I get to the end.
All right, I tend to agree.
- Shouldn't we wait here?
- For what?
To see if anybody comes.
No one is gonna come.
Look. There is a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out.
We can avoid the traps using the boot.
Holloway is it?
What do you think? Look for an exit?
Okay.
What about you?
- It can't be that simple.
- It won't be that simple.
Look around.
Take a good long looksee.
'Cause I got a feeling it's looking at us.
I just want to wake up.
Leaven. We can do this.
We just have to stay calm and work together as a team.
There's gonna be a lot of people looking for us on the outside.
I'm a cop.
All right?
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.
You gotta be with me on this one.
Okay.
Boot it!
Clean.
That one sounded closer.
It's mechanical. It seems to come at regular intervals.
Maybe it's the ventilation system.
- No vents.
- No kidding, I'm boiling.
What is it?
Serial numbers?
Room numbers.
They're different in each room.
Oh great. There are only 566 millions
400 thousand rooms in this thing.
Well, there better not be?
We have about 3 days without food and water before we are too weak to move.
Well, they have to feed us, don't they?
Holloway.
Oh, we have heat, stress, physical exsection, i.e., dehydratation, headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confused mental processes.
The body eventually begins to break down its own tissue.
Suck on it.
Keeps the saliva flowing.
- What?
- The air seems dry in there.
Trapped?
Molecular chemical sensor.
Why the hell didn't the boot set it off?
The boot's not alive.
Detects hydrogen sulphide excreted from the skin.
How is it you know so much about sensors, Renz?
Renn. Not Renz. It's French.
Fine, you're French.
I'm asking how you...
Renn. Sensor expert, about the right age.
I don't believe it.
- This guy is the Wren.
- The what?
He's the Wren. The Bird of Attica.
Flew the coop on 6 major prisons.
Seven.
You're kidding, right?
You can get us out.
Maybe.
An escape artist.
Yeah, I'm Harry fucking Houdini.
The only reason I dragged you this far is 'cause I need your boots.
If you don't smarten up,
I'll be gone like that.
No more talking.
No more guessing.
Don't even think about nothing that's not right in front of you.
That's the real challenge.
You got to save yourselves from yourselves.
Merde.
Get him out!
Oh my god!
So, it was electro chemical or whatever, right? And he missed it.
The Wren. That's great!
That's fuckin' great!
All right. It's time to reassess this place.
I've been over it again and again.
Why would they throw innocent people in here?
Are we being punished?
I've never done anything to deserve this.
Forget about all that!
You can't see the big picture from in here, so don't try.
Keep your head down.
Keep it simple.
Just look at what's in front of you.
That's what he said.
Start with us.
We got an escape artist and a cop.
There's gotta be a reason for that.
You're doctor, Holloway. It gives you a function, a reason, right?
No. It's just makes me go why me and why not one of the other
10 million doctors out there.
Leaven, what are you?
Nothing. I just go to school.
I hang out with my friends.
- What else?
- There's nothing else.
My parents are these people.
I live with them. I'm boring.
I think we have to ask the big questions.
What does it want?
What is it thinking?
One down, four to go.
Why don't you tell us what your purpose is, Worth?
Often wondered that myself.
I'm just a guy.
I work in an office building, doing office building stuff.
I wasn't exactly bursting with
"joie de vivre" before I got here.
Life just sucks in general.
- I can't stand that attitude.
- Because he's right.
What's your purpose, Quentin?
Kids, three of them.
I haven't made my peace yet.
I'm getting out of here, no matter what.
That's where my strength comes from.
You, people, find yours wherever you got it.
For Christ's sake, Worth.
What do you live for?
Don't you have a wife or a girlfriend, or something?
No. I've got a pretty fine collection of pornography.
Oh, nice, nice.
I haven't got anybody either, but
I'm not giving up! I am pissed off.
They came into our homes!
They stripped us bare.
They took my rings, they took...
...oh, my amethyst.
I wanna know who's responsible.
Leaven. Your glasses?
You don't need them?
They're for reading.
Well they took off our jewelry, but why they put these on you.
If nothing is random, why are they here?
Leaven. What do you do in school? Math?
What can they mean?
Prime numbers. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.
See what?
It seems like, if any of these numbers are prime, then the room's trapped.
645, 645... That's not prime.
372... no.
Well, 11 times 59.
It's not prime either.
So that room is safe.
Wait.
How can you make that assumption based on one prime number trap?
I'm not. The incinerator thing was prime 083.
The molecular chemical thing had
137. The acid room had 149.
You remember all that in your head?
I have a facility for it.
Leaven, you beautiful brain.
Boot it.
Okay, out of the way.
Brains before beauty.
Safe, safe.
Prime numbers! Prime numbers!
Oh, how long have we been in here?
Nine or ten hours.
How do you know?
Five o'clock shadow. Last thing
I remember was shaving.
I guess
I missed breakfast or lunch... or whatever.
Don't worry.
I'll be home in time for dinner.
If we get out, I'll make you dinner.
You got a date.
Doin' good.
I need to smoke.
I'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk.
Holloway.
Just reel yourself in a bit. Come on.
We're moving along.
Things are looking up.
Ok, ok. You are right.
I quit smoking years ago.
I just need to be occupied.
Talk then. Have a conversation.
What kind of doctor are you anyway?
Oh, you know, the free kind.
Come on. Help me.
Tell me about your rug rats.
We have three boys. 9, 7 and 5.
Good God. Poor woman.
There's no way I'd survive that.
She didn't either.
She's not dead, we're just separated.
I'm sorry.
I can't just shoot the breeze.
These numbers aren't prime.
Okay, clear.
Excuse me, sorry.
You, could try and help me out here, buddy.
No, I couldn't.
This one's trapped too.
We have to backtrack?
Not yet.
Read them to me.
- What are you, his coat rack?
- Oh, please!
It's stuck.
Look out.
This room is green.
Holloway?
Hi there.
This room is green.
Yes, it is.
I wanna go back to the blue room.
What is it? Shock or what?
I think he's mentally handicapped.
I like the blue room.
- Jesus Christ.
- He almost broke my neck.
Hey there, are you all alone?
You want to hold my hand, honey?
Butter first, then honey, Kazan.
Butter first, then honey...
- How'd he survive?
- I want to go back to the blue room.
There's lots of blue rooms.
We'll find you another real soon.
This is just way too bizarre.
Well, you just worry about your numbers then.
Go on. I'll look after him.
Safe. Obviously, since he almost fell on my head.
Should we go for a walk, Kazan?
You want to go for a walk?
Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away.
Holloway...
Hol-lo-way.
Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico?
What are you talking about, Holloway?
I'm talking about where do you hide something this big.
At least he's good for something.
I'm sorry to shake your foundations, Quentin, but you have no idea where your tax dollars go.
Free clinic doctors?
Only the military industrial complex could afford to build something this size.
Holloway, what is the military industrial complex?
Have you ever been there?
I'm telling you, it's not that complex.
How would you know from where you are?
Who do you think the establishment is?
It's just guys like me.
Their desks are bigger, but their jobs are't.
They don't conspire... they buy boats.
No, this place is... remember Scaramanga?
The bad guy in
"The Man With The Golden Gun".
It's some rich psycho's entertainment.
Is that what you think?
Clear.
Ok. You are a cop.
Single bullet theory. Right on.
- Gas!
- Holloway, get back here!
It's okay.
I just swallowed my button.
I hate this. I hate this.
Your boy is having a conniption fit in there.
It's like cramming without coffee.
- She needs a break.
- She can do it.
They don't look like prime to me.
Is that your two bits worth, Worth?
For what it's worth.
- Well?
- Well, he's right. Not prime.
Stop! In front of you!
What is it?
Shut up!
I don't know what happened.
It wasn't prime.
Quentin, hold still.
- Somebody stops that racket.
- Worth!
Leave the boots.
And shut the fucking door!
I had a feeling about that fucking guy.
He knew about that trap.
These numbers aren't prime.
Then your number system failed, but he knew...
Knew what? How would he know?
You are the paranoid one, think about it.
His only function so far has been to kick us when we're down.
So he has a bad attitude. Are you saying, that makes him a spy?
Trust me on this. It's my job to read people like an X-Ray.
He doesn't like red rooms.
So what happened?
- You saw what happened.
- Quentin!
I guess the numbers are more complicated that I thought.
Maybe they mean nothing at all.
No. It means they are more involved.
They've worked for us up 'till now, haven't they?
I just need more time with them.
Well, we need to rest anyway.
Well. That's handy. 'Cause there's not a fuck of a lot else we can do.
Are they telling you anything?
They're not tarot cards.
Do you have any idea how many variables I have to consider before I can decipher numbers this size?
They don't reveal themselves right away.
They're like people.
Oh, gross.
Oh, not here honey.
Over in the corner.
Well, he's just peeing.
Jesus Christ.
That's excellent.
Now it totally reeks in here!
You find this all pretty funny, don't you?
What's your fucking problem, Worth?
Even Holloway's holding up better than you.
Get over there and help her with him.
That's your job. Babysitter.
Jawohl, Kommandant.
Somebody has to take responsability around here.
And that somebody has to be you.
Not all of us have the luxury of playing nihilist.
Not all of us are conceited enough to play hero.
This is a will to live.
Everybody's got it,
Worth, even you.
Especially you, hiding behind that cynical front.
A will to live.
That's the warm, cosy feeling deep inside.
Thanks Quentin, I'm a new man.
Oh, poor Worth. Nobody loves me.
If that's the chip on your shoulder, why did you lug it all this way?
Why didn't you just lie down and die?
Do it.
Show us you have some backbone and jump in the sushi machine.
Be a man.
Thought so.
Fuck you Quentin!
I don't wanna die.
I'm just being realistic.
Do you think they'd go to all the trouble to build this thing if we could just walk out?
Do you think they would have left us clues and let us beat it so far if there wasn't a way out?
You think we matter? We don't.
Put us out of your misery so we can get on with getting out of here.
You're not getting out of here!
- Yes, we are!
- No, you're not!
- Yes, we are!
- There is no way out of here!
Gotchya.
How do you know that?
Answer the question, Worth.
Oh, god.
Who are you?
I'm the poison.
I designed the outer shell.
The what?
The shell. The sarcophagus.
You built this thing?
Not this part. The exterior.
I don't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here.
I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell.
A cube.
A cube? Why didn't you tell us?
For God's sake, Worth, you knew what it was.
No.
Worth. You're lying.
Was not at first.
Who's behind it?
I don't know.
Who hired you?
I didn't ask.
I never even left my office.
I talked on the phone to some people, other guys like me.
Specialists, working on small details.
Nobody knew what it was.
Nobody cared.
Bullshit.
You knew from square one.
Look at him. He is up to his eyeballs in this thing.
No, Quentin.
That's how they stay hidden.
You keep everyone separated so the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
The brain never comes out in the open.
Whose brain?
It's all the same machine, right!
The Pentagone, multinational corporations, the police.
If you do one little job, you build a widget in Saskatoon, and the next thing you know it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a death machine.
I was right.
All along, my whole life,
I knew it. I told you, Quentin.
Nobody's every gonna call me paranoid again.
We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing!
Holloway, you don't get it.
Then help me, please, I need to know.
This may be hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy.
Nobody is in charge.
It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan.
Can you grasp that?
Big brother is not watching you.
What kind of fuckin' explanation is that?
It's the best you are gonna get.
I looked, and the only conclusion
I could come to is that there is nobody up there.
Somebody had to say yes to this thing.
What thing?
Only we know what it is.
- We have no idea what it is.
- We know more than anybody else.
I mean, somebody might have known sometime before they go, they got fired, or voted out, or sold it, but if this place ever had a purpose, and it got miscommunicated, or lost in a shuffle.
I mean, this is and accident, a forgotten perpetual public works project.
Do you think anybody wants to ask questions?
All they want is a clear conscience, and a fat paycheck.
I leaned on my shovel for months on this one.
This was a great job!
Why put people in it?
Because it's here. You have to use it or you admit it's pointless.
But it is pointless.
Quentin. That's my point.
What have we come to?
It's so much worse than I thought.
Not really. Just more pathetic.
You make me sick, Worth.
I make me sick too.
We're both part of the system.
I drew a box, you walk a beat.
It's like you said, Quentin, is keep your head down, keep it simple, just look at what's in front of you.
I mean, nobody wants to see the big picture.
Life's too complicated.
I mean, let's face it, the reason we're here is that it's out of control.
This is how we ruin the world?
Well, have you been on glue all your lives?
I've felt guilty for ruining the world since I was like 7.
God, if you need someone to blame, throw a rock.
Well, I feel better.
That's why you stayed with us.
To confess.
You still looking for someone to bust, Quentin?
Quentin! Stop it! Stop it!
We need him.
What for?
Have you gone absolutely mad?
He's the only one who knows anything about the place.
- Worth.
- Hi.
- So there's this outer shell.
- Yeah.
- And it's a cube, right? Like this.
- I assume so.
- Are there any doors?
- There's one door.
- Where?
- Wherever the door guy put it.
Six guesses, and it's sealed from the outside.
And, what are the dimensions of the outer shell?
434 square feet.
May I?
Come on, honey, slide over.
14 by 14 by 14.
The inner cube can't be flush with the shell wall, there's a space.
One cube?
I don't know, it makes sense.
Ok. The biggest the cube can be then is...
26 rooms high,
26 rooms across, so...
17.576 rooms.
Seventeen thousand, five hundred and seventy-six rooms?
That makes me queasy.
Descartes!
- Leaven, you are a genius.
- What? What?
Cartesian coordinates. Of course, coded cartesian coordinates.
They're used in geometry to plot points on a 3-dimensional graph.
In English, slower.
Bonjour?
These numbers are markers, and grid reference, like latitude and longitude on a map.
The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube.
Well, where are we?
It works.
Okay. All I have to do is add the numbers together.
The X coordinate is 19...
Y is 26 rooms...
So that places us...
...seven rooms from the edge.
All right, let's go.
Just out of curiosity, I mean, don't hit me again, or anything... but what are you gonna do when you get there?
Maybe we can get the door open.
What we need is to do figure out how to get around the traps.
I'm dealing with that Holloway.
I'm looking for practical solutions here.
Well, you haven't found any yet.
We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first.
No, he won't Quentin!
We take turns!
Relax.
Room for two in there?
What's the matter?
These coordinates. 14, 27, 14.
- What about 'em?
- They don't make sense.
Assuming the cube is
26 rooms across, there can't be a coordinate larger than 26.
If this were right, then we would be outside of the cube.
No, not outside of the cube.
I guess that means we're not having dinner.
Trap. Trap. Trap. Trap.
Trap!
Trap!
Sound activated.
Lovely.
How come the sound of the door opening didn't set it off?
Must be rigged to ignore it.
So that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps.
Well, I guess we have to backtrack, and try somewhere else.
Who knows how many detours we'll have to take.
I say we cross the bitch.
Right!
How many boots do we have left,
Holloway?
Get it off him.
We know how it works.
We just have to be quiet.
That's pretty fucking quiet.
I'm glad you're on side,
Worth, 'cause... you're up.
And he is not coming.
Of course, he is.
- No way.
- We are not leaving him behind.
He's unpredictable.
When we get to the edge, we can come back for him.
But he'll get somebody killed here.
Am I right?
Shame on you.
Will you look at yourselves?
What have you turned into?
They may have taken our lives away, but we are still human beings.
That's all we've got left.
We'll come back for him.
That's a lie and you know it.
He'll be quiet.
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna wait for him.
- No.
- You go out, I'm here.
Okay.
This way.
- You fucking fuck!
- That's enough!
- He is a trap!
- Let him go right now!
The law of the jungle!
He is endangering the pack!
Let him go, you Nazi!
What did you call me?
Quentin, you let that innocent boy go.
You listen to me, woman.
Everyday I mop up after your bleeding heart.
The only reason you even exist is because I keep you.
I know your type, no kids, no man to fuck you.
So you go around outraged, sticking your nose up other people's assholes, sniffing their business!!!
You missed your boat, Holloway.
You're all dried up inside there, aren't you?
That's your fucking problem.
How dare you say that to her?
You don't know her, Quentin.
None of us know each other here.
- Oh, I do.
- No you don't.
No wonder your wife left you.
All that bottled up anger.
And a thing for young girls.
God help you, Quentin.
Did you smack your kids around too?
Is anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that door?
Open it.
Door number six? Not number one?
Door number two?
Open the fuckin' thing.
Oh, sunshine.
Night time.
My old friend, the shell.
It's there. Morning!
Hang on to me.
I can't see shit.
Nothin' to hang on to.
We gotta try something.
We gotta see if the door's over there.
Someone has to swing over there, and take a look.
Swing?
We make a rope, out of clothes.
Take 'em off.
I'll tie it around myself.
Ah, yeah, and you're gonna go.
You weight like 500 ponds, it'll snap in two seconds.
I'm the lightest.
Forget it.
I'll go.
I'm going, Holloway.
She's right Quentin, you're too heavy.
I'm the lightest after Leaven.
Anyway, it's my turn.
How long did you know people were being put in here?
A couple of months.
That's not long, if you consider your whole life.
I am.
You opened my eyes Worht.
That's something.
David.
Helen.
You're such a Helen.
That's as far as you go.
There's nothing down here.
Hold tight.
I try swinging over there.
Brace yourselves,
I'm gonna try again.
- Okay, one more time.
- Hurry, you're getting heavy.
What the hell's going on?
Get up here now!
- Quentin!
- Have you got her?
- What's going on?
- Quentin, is she okay?
She... slipped.
Holloway?
Hey, shhh...
Come on, Kazan.
Kazan, will you please stop doing that?
Leaven, you got be strong, sweetheart.
Don't even talk to me.
We gotta get down to the bottom.
It will be easier to get on to the shell from there.
It's a long fucking way with only one boot.
But we gotta do it before we get too weak.
You gotta keep cracking the numbers, Leaven.
I can't think anymore.
Sure you can. It's your gift.
It's not a gift. It's just a brain.
Let her sleep for a while. We haven't slept in fuck knows how long.
All right.
One hour.
How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is?
An hour is as long as I say.
What are you doing?
We have to make it down to the bottom.
It'll be quiet there, and you can concentrate.
- You just want to leave them?
- They're traps, Leaven.
We are the key.
I'll get us down there.
You think us out.
Believe in me!
Try and see what I see, how my mind works.
The flash when I look into someone's head like a fucking X-ray.
I looked through the walls.
I dreamed him at his desk, designing everything.
He can't let you solve the puzzle, see, 'cause there is a purpose.
We are the purpose. The cube...
...is us.
- Quentin.
- We fit. Like numbers.
A man and a woman.
Two halves of the equation.
I take you down, the perfect key.
I slip you in the lock.
Leaven, it's time to go down.
Get away from her.
Leaven, they're fuckin' spies.
Him, the retard.
Holloway, had outside information about my family... but she slipped up, didn't she?
She crossed the line!
You dropped her.
Just go, Quentin.
Give us the boot, you pig!
You don't want the boot.
You want to came with us, Worth?
Down the hatch.
What the fuck's with him?
How did...
It's, it's, it's the Wren.
It's the old Wrenster.
How could...
We've been going around in circles.
That can't be.
- Where are we?
- I don't know!
Where are we?
You figure it out!
You haven't done anything.
All you do is freak out you, murderer!
I guess you were right, Worth.
There is no way out of here.
Get away from me.
Wasn't Rennes killed in that room?
How come there's nothing out there?
It's the edge.
We weren't at the edge before.
Where's the room that killed Rennes?
Fuck off!
Oh, that was good.
What difference does it make?
We're dead anyways.
Hey, listen to what I'm saying.
There was a room there before.
We haven't been moving in circles.
The rooms have.
- Of course.
- The rooms?
That explains the thunder and the shaking.
We've been shifting the whole time.
It's the only logical explanation.
I'm such an idiot!
- What are you on to, Leaven?
- Give me a minute.
The numbers are markers, points on a map, right?
Right.
How do you map a point that keeps moving?
Permutations.
Permu what?
Permutations.
A list of all the coordinates that the room passes through.
Like a map, that tells you where the rooms starts, how many times it moves, and where it moves to.
The numbers tell you all that?
I don't know, see, I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is probably the starting position.
All I saw was what the cube looked like before it started to move.
Okay, so it's moving.
How do we get out?
I know where the exit is.
Where?
- Stay away from me.
- Back off, Quentin.
I just wanna know.
Don't you wanna know?
You remember that room we passed through before, the one with the coordinate larger than 26?
What about it?
That coordinate placed the room outside the cube.
A bridge.
Right.
But only in its original position.
What are you talking about?
Look.
The room starts off as a bridge, and then it moves its way through the maze, which is where we ran into it.
But at some point, it must return to its original position.
- So a bridge is only a bridge.
- For a short period of time.
This thing is like a giant combination lock.
When the rooms are in their starting position, the lock is open.
But when they move out of alignment, the lock closes.
With a structure this size, it must take days for the rooms to complete a full cycle.
So, when does it open?
Don't.
To find the original coordinates, the numbers are added together.
To find the permutations, they're subtracted from one another.
That's it!
This room moves to zero,
1 and -1 on the X-axis.
2, 5 and -7 on Y.
And 1, and -1 and zero on Z.
And what does that mean?
You suck at math?
Okay, I need the room numbers around us as reference points.
- 567, 898. Okay?
- Yes.
And 545.
Did you get that?
That's enough.
X is 17, Y is 25 and Z is 14.
Which means this room makes 2 more moves before returning to its original position.
- Do we have time?
- Maybe.
Then let's go!
Can you work the traps into this system?
Fuck the traps.
Let's get to the bridge.
You threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot.
- Technically, I can identify the traps.
- Technically?
At first, I thought that they were identified by prime numbers, but they are not.
They are identified by numbers that are the power of a prime.
- Ok, so?
- Can you calculate that?
The numbers are huge.
But you can, right? She can.
I'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set.
Maybe if I had a computer.
- You don't need a computer.
- Yes I do.
- Figure it out.
- I can't.
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!
Look. Nobody in the whole world could do it mentally.
Look at the numbers. 567898545.
There's no way I can factor that!
I can't even start on 567!
It's astronomical!
Astronomical.
What did you say?
Astronomical.
Before that.
Factors.
How many factors Kazan?
Of 567.
What, are you fucking kidding?
Kazan. How many factors does 30 have?
- How about 7?
- 1. Gum drop.
I don't have any gum drops.
Gum drop.
Kazan. I'll give you a whole box of gum drops for each answer.
Gum drops come in bags.
Okay. You want them in bags, they are coming in bags.
I don't like the red ones.
He's giving us the factors.
Astronomical.
You're telling me telethon boy is a genius?
By those numbers, the room should be safe.
Only one way to find out.
Don't!
Safe.
Kazan, my man.
What's the number, buddy boy?
Hey, right here, look here!
Make him do it!
Kazan, we're gonna do some numbers now, okay?
We like to do numbers, right?
- Prime numbers.
- That's right.
- Can you tell me the factor of 656?
- Clear.
- Move!
Come on. Come on, let's go. You too, Worth!
Move your scawny ass, Worth.
I'm not through with you yet.
Leaven, open that door.
Get Einstein working on the numbers.
Oh, jeez.
- Go!
- Worth!
- Hurry!
- Leaven!
- Please, Kazan, 563?
- You fuckers, you're dead!
- Clear!
- Trapped!
- Check the floor.
- Is he dead?
Not quite.
Not even close. Worth,
I'm getting out of here and
I'll feed you to a fucking trap on the way.
Where is he?
Come here. I said come here right nooowwww!!
Gotchya. That way.
- Clear!
- Clear!
Guess that proves our theory.
Numbers.
- Clear.
Kazan!
Listen.
- He hasn't moved far.
- I'll go find him.
What do you think?
You don't have a lot of lives left.
- Kazan!
- I didn't move.
Yeah, good. But you're gonna have to climb up here, okay?
I don't like that.
Worth, get back here right now!
Five bags of gum drops.
27 bags total.
27 bags. Deal.
This room's next move takes it to the bridge!
We're coming!
Over here!
Move it! We don't have much time. Come on.
Worth? Worth?
This better be it.
It should be.
Where?
Oh, well!
Give me a minute. Be patient.
- So, guess what?
- No.
This is the room we started in.
I was right. We should never have moved in the first place.
The bridge.
Red.
Kazan?
- Clear!
Worth!
Go ahead.
What are you doing?
You can't quit now.
It's not your fault!
I have nothing to live for out there.
What is out there?
Boundless human stupidity.
I can live with that.
Noooooo!!!
Kazan! Get out through the door!
Red, Kazan.

It was summer,
1948, and I needed money.
After going door-to-door all daylong,
I was back again at Joppy's Bar, tryin' to figure out...
where I was gonna go lookin' for work the next day.
The newspapers was goin' on and on about the city elections,
like they was really gonna change somebody's life.
Well, my life had already changed when
I lost my job three weeks before.
For example, one of the white guys pulls a double shift, says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire them.
That's all you have to say?
No, no, that's not all.
I-I need...
I need to pay my mortgage, and eat.
I need a house to live in. I need to put clothes on my back, Mr. Giacomo.
- I need the job.
- I'm sorry, fella. I gotta get back to work.
My name's not “fella.”
Huh?
My name's not “fella.”
My name is Ezekiel Rawlins.
Catch you later, Joppy.
Hey, watch the marble!
Damn it! What'd I tell you?
Joppy, how much you think they're payin' out there at Douglas Aircraft?
I don't know. Don't it say on the...
Talk to him. Yes, sir.
You can talk to him.
All right.
Easy, come on over here.
I've got somebody
I want you to meet.
Come on. This here's a friend of mine.
Yeah, Easy, this is Mr. Albright.
- You can call me Dewitt, Easy.
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right.
- Take a seat, Easy.
Mr. Albright and me go way back to before the war.
Matter of fact, when I was still in the fight game.
Mm-hmm.
Ever seen this guy fight?
- No.
- No?
Well, shoot. Every time Joppy
Shag stepped into the ring, you knew you was gonna see some real knock-down-drag-out fisticuffs.
- Where you from, Easy?
- Houston.
Mmm, Houston.
That's Joppy's hometown.
So, I hear you need a job.
Oh, yeah, uh, Easy's always tryin' to do better.
He's one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house.
He's payin' the mortgage every month, just like y'all folks.
Property owner, huh? These big companies don't give a damn, do they, Easy?
I got out of that racket a long time ago.
Look, if you do need a job, you drop by this address... 7:00 tonight.
What kind of work you do?
I do favors.
I do favors for friends.
Drop DY-
Who was that,
Joppy?
Just somebody I know.
Businessman.
- Businessman, huh?
- Yeah, he is.
Ain't nothin' to worry about.
Now, when somebody tell me ain't nothin' to worry about,
I usually look down to see if my fly is open.
But all the way home all I could think about was a chance to make some money.
I first came out to Los Angeles...
when I got home from the war in Europe...
with $300 in my pocket and the G.I. Bill.
- Like me, a lot of colored folk from
Texas and Louisiana... - Hi, Easy.
Had moved out to California to get them good jobs...
- ...in the shipyards and in the aircraft companies. - Hey, Willy!
Now, me myself,
I was a machinist.
And the first thing I did when I saved enough money was to buy me a house.
Man, I loved comin' home to my house.
I don't know. I guess maybe
I just loved ownin' somethin'.
How ya doin'?
- Ezekiel, I'm gonna knock down some of them trees in the back. - No, leave my trees alone.
- I aint' gonna take but five...
- Get on!
I was feelin' pretty desperate that evenin'.
In a week I'd be two months behind on my mortgage,
and, no, sir, I wasn't about to lose my house.
But a chill runnin' up the back of my neck was talkin' to me,
tellin' me I was about to make a bad decision.
Yeah, Albright made me nervous.
He reminded me of a fella I knew back in Texas named Mouse.
Drive to the train yard, Easy.
Let's dump this damn thing...
- What did you do, Mouse?
- Just drive this son of a bitch.
What did you do?
So... want the job?
It depends“.on what kind of job it is.
I don't wanna get mixed up in nothin'.
Hmm. Walk out the door in the morning, Easy, you're mixed up in somethin'.
Only thing that matters is if you're mixed up to the top or not.
I'm just lookin' for somebody.
For a friend.
Daphne Monet.
Fiancée of Todd Carter.
She been gone two weeks.
It upset the poor man so much, he stopped runnin' for mayor.
I never laid eyes on her.
That's a shame.
See, Daphne has a predilection for the company of Negroes.
She likes jazz and pigs' feet and dark meat.
Know what I mean?
Predilection, yeah.
Yeah.
I'd go lookin' for her myself, but...
I'm not of the right persuasion, so to speak.
- What do you want from me?
- What do you mean?
What do you want me to do?
Get a location on her.
Mr. Carter wants to make up with her.
Hundred dollars.
I pay in advance.
Hundred dollars.
And all I got to do is tell you where she's at?
- That's right.
- And that's all?
That's all.
- You frequent an illegal club on
89th and Central. - Yeah, John's.
Somebody saw Daphne there a few nights ago.
You could start tonight.
Hmm.
Whoa, that's enough.
Thank you.
See you later, man.
All right. Yeah.

Colored brother,
I need you to...
Mister, you can't be in here harassin' folks. I'm not harassing him.
- What's goin' on? - I just paid these cops off and they're rousting my customers.
- I hear music. - That's what he get for messin' with that white woman.
- Come on, brother.
- Don't pay him no attention, Easy.
- I rung for Junior to take care of that.
- I come from Detroit.
- Ain't got nobody but Deucy tonight.
- It's on me. Tell 'em I'm your cousin.

- Hey, hey, hey!
Junior! Wait for the cops to leave.
Take Easy on upstairs.
And if he's still here, throw his ass out.

Yeah, you just wait.
You just keep waitin'.
Mr. McGee, there is no upstairs.

Last time I heard these fellas was back in Houston.
That night Mouse had to pull me off your ass.
- That's the way you remember it, huh?
- That's the way it was.
When you gonna admit that you helped
Mouse kill old man Navrochet?
You don't...
Man, come on, get off that.
You know I didn't have nothin' to do with that.
Where are all the white women at?
- I don't pay them no mind.
- I bet you don't.

You all right, Odell?
He used to play till the cock crowed.
That old cock, it don't crow nearly so much now.
Ahh. I better get on home.
You'd be sorry if you go.
I be sorry if I stay too.
Good night, Coretta.
Daphne sleep by now, so... you can't get none of that tonight.
Go around here tellin' everybody “Dahlia.”
Her name is Daphne.
Do you know her?
Where you want me to put him at, baby?
- This ain't my house!
- What?
This ain't even my house.
- Just throw him in there on the bed.
- Shut up, Negro.
Where my keys?
Careful of the door.
Throwed him out of his place 'cause he couldn't pay the rent.
I shouldn't even let him sleep here tonight.
Damn, that Negro's heavy.
I know. I know.
I need a cigarette.
That all you need?
Girl, that sun catch me tiptoein' out your door, ain't no tellin' what your neighbors might say.
All right, Easy.
All right.
Dupree done fell asleep on me, and you just gonna walk out on me like I was dog food, huh?
What? Girl, what you talkin' about?
Now, come on.
Coretta, your man is in the next room.
Why don't you tell me about your friend Daphne?
Why do you keep askin' about her? Hmm?
Colored women ain't good enough for you no more, huh, Easy?
No, that ain't it.
Look, I mean-
Shoot.
Well, what if he was to hear somethin'?
He asleep.
Ohh! Baby, that's it!
Oh, yes!
Oh, baby!
Oh, baby, that's it!
Ohh! Ohh!
You're hittin' my spot!
- Yeah, baby! Ohh!
- You're hittin' my spot!
Easy, Easy, Easy.
I can't give up that much lovin', daddy.
Not the way things is.
- What things? - Come on now.
Dupree right in the next room.
Forget about Dupree, baby.
You done got me goin', Coretta.
It ain't right, Easy. Here I am doin' this right in the next room.
All you doin' is nosin' after my friend Daphne.
Daph... Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yeah.
No, baby. That's just a job.
- What job?
- Some man want me to find her.
- What man?
- I don't know what man, baby.
I just, you know... I don't want nobody but you“.baby.
Yeah.
Mmm. Ohhh!
Daphne's my friend.
I can't do it.
- Huh-uh.
- Shit.
Just a little bit more, okay?
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit, baby.
Ohhh, just a little bit.
Oh, that's it, that's it, that's it.
- Oh, you're hittin' my spot.
- Yeah, baby.
Oh, you're hittin' my spot.
- Ohh! Oh, that's it. That's it, daddy.
- Yeah, that's it.
Then I went on hittin' her spot until just before sunup.
I realized later on that Coretta had found out as much about what I was up to...
...as I had found out about Daphne Monet.
As it turned out, Todd Carter wasn't the only man in Daphne's life.
She was also shackin' up with some small-time colored gangster named Frank Green,
and Coretta had the nerve to charge me $ 70 for that information.
See, everybody was in business in Los Angeles.
I spent that morning waiting for Albright to call...
and trying to feel good about being able to pay a few bills.
And I mean just a few.
Shoot, a loaf of bread was damn near 75 cents.
It was easy money.
Too easy.
- Bye, Easy.
- Hey, where you goin', Sophie?
Back to Texas.
Too fast for me out here.
- Bye, Mr. Rawlins!
- All right, then.
Hey, get on away from them people's house!
Get away from that tree!
Get on away from that tree now!
Go on.
Get away from that tree.
Ricky! Come on, wash your hands.
It's time for supper.
Ricky!
- Hello?
- Easy, how you doin', buddy?
- Who is this?
- I hope you have good news for me.
Oh, Mr. Albright, is that you?
- Sure is, Easy. What's shakin'?
- I got what you want.
Why don't you hold onto that, Easy.
I only do business in person.
Tell you what, real quick.
You come on out here to Malibu.
Meet me at the Fisherman's Pier hamburger stand in an hour. Okay?
Malibu? Look, Mr. Albright...
Mr. Albright?
Hi.
It's pretty out here, huh?
Yeah, it's all right.
I'm from Des Moines, Iowa.
Where are you from?
Texas.
Do they have an ocean in Texas?
- Hey, Barbara!
- Gulf. A gulf in Texas.
Barbara, where are you?
- I think your friends are lookin' for you.
- Who cares?
My sister brought me here because my parents made her.
- Where is that girl? - All she wants to do is make out with Herman and smoke cigarettes.
Hey, there!
What are you doin' out here?
- Hey, what's goin' on? - Leave us alone, Herman. We're just talking.
- We don't need you talkin' to her, okay? - I said leave us alone.
- We're just talkin' about the ocean.
- What's wrong?
This nigger's tryin' to pick up on Barbara.
I don't want trouble.
Just tryin' to be polite.
No, you're not. You're talkin' about the ocean.
- Hey, there!
- What do you want?
- What's goin' on?
- What do you want?
What do I want?
I wanna see your brains.
- Shit!
- Run, man, run!
Sorry, sir.
I didn't mean it.
- You sorry enough?
- Yes, sir, I am.
Yeah?
Then prove it.
Come on, prove it.
Show him.
- Get on your knees. Suck his peter!
- Please. I'm sorry.
- I think he's got the point. He's got the point! - You heard me. Go on.
Do it! I'll kill you.
I'll blow your brains out.
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't shoot me, please.
Now go on.
Go on.
All right.
God.
Son of a gun.
You're gonna do it?
Sick bastard!
Ohh! Oh, God, my eye!
Get the hell outta here.
You call the cops,
I'll kill ya!
Hurry up, man! Come on!
I don't think they'd dare call the cops, but we better get the hell outta here in case they do.
- What do ya got, Easy? - Ain't no harm gonna come to that girl 'cause of me?
Mr. Carter wants to buy her a gold ring and live happily ever after.
- What do ya got? - Woman told me she was with a man named Frank Green.
Hang on. Where?
- The Skyler Apartments. Skyler and 83rd.
- Skyler and 83rd.
Frank Green. What do you know about this guy?
He's a gangster, hijacker. Liquor and cigarettes. Pretty good with a knife.
- Ever seen him in action?
- No, I just heard about him.
Easy.
Here's another hundred.
I'll be calling you again.
Okay.
- Mr. Rawlins, I'm Detective Miller.
- Mason.
- What?
- Turn around and put your hands on the car.
- Come with us.
- Where? Why are you arrestin' me?
- You'll see. - I got a right to know why you're arrestin' me.
You got a right to fall down, break your face. You got a right to come with me.
That guy over there?
- You got him, huh?
- Yeah, we got him comin' home.
Ezekiel Rawlins.
We can take those cuffs off if you want to cooperate.
- Yes, sir. I'm cooperating.
- Turn around.
Sit over there.
Sit down.
Now, earlier this morning about 5:00 a.m.
- What do you mean?
- He means this morning.
I was... I was out drinkin'.
I carried a friend into his house.
I don't know. I could've been on my way home. I ain't look at no clock.
- You were drinkin'. Illegal club called John's. - What is goin' on?
You may as well answer. You got bigger troubles than us bustin' some bar.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
We're talkin' about taking your black ass out... and puttin' a bullet in your head.
Sit down.
- Now, what time did you leave Coretta
James' house? - Around 5:30, I guess.
- You go back later in the day?
- No, sir, I did not.
You and Dupree Brouchard, did you have words over Miss James?
- Words?
- Did you two argue over Coretta James?
- Did you argue over Coretta?
- No, we didn't. He was asleep.
Yeah, she went to sleep too, but she's not gonna wake up.
- What?
- Where did you go when you left Miss James?
Wait, wait, wait.
What you talkin' about?
- Where did you go?
- I was... I had a hangover.
- You had a hangover?
- Yeah, I went home.
Oh, he had a hangover.
That explains everything.
Back off! Back off!
Back off!
- Here, here.
- No, no! Get outta here!
- Let me at him.
- Go on, get out! Get outta here!
- Come on, you son of a bitch!
- Jack, get out, goddamn...
- All right. All right.
- Calm down. Calm down.
- You son of a bitch.
- Jesus!
They left me alone in that musty little room another three hours,
till some guy in a suit about two sizes too big for him came in and said I could go.
- Hey, buddy. - The game of cops and niggers kept up outside the station,
but I hardly even noticed.
I had seen dead bodies before,
...cold, hard, still as concrete,
...their eyes wide open, starin' up at nothin'.
But not Coretta.
I could still feel her heartbeat.
Hey, Ezekiel Rawlins.
Hold on, Ezekiel. Somebody in the back would like to talk to you.
I ain't got time right now.
Get in.
We'll take you.
My boss wants to talk to you about Coretta James.
Listen, if he wanted to hurt you, it would've happened already.
Come on.
Get in.
You want to go up front and sit with Norman?
Okay, give me a kiss.
That's my adopted son, Jesus.
I can see the police roughed you up a bit.
That's a practice of theirs that has to change, Mr. Rawlins.
- That has to change.
- Thank you.
She was beaten... and died of a heavy blow to the back of the head.
I suppose you already know that.
No, I didn't, Mr. Terell.
Oh, you know who I am?
I read the newspapers. You're runnin' for mayor against Todd Carter.
I am the next mayor,
Mr. Rawlins.
And, luckily for you, a friend of the Negro.
Coretta worked for a while for me.
She answered phones at my campaign office on 103rd and Western.
So when I heard that the police had a suspect,
I got out of bed immediately, personally, because of my concern.
Was there anyone with you,
Mr. Rawlins?
Anyone besides
Mr. Dupree Brouchard?
No, sir.
A young lady named Daphne Monet, perhaps?
Nobody.
Of course not.
I mean, why would-
Why would you tell someone whom you've only just met?
I mean-
You can trust me,
Mr. Rawlins.
There was nobody else there.
I believe you. Uh, can we drop you off at your-
No. I mean-
I can get out here.
Are you sure?
This must be quite out of your way.
No, it's okay.
It's okay.
May I offer you cab fare?
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- It's okay.
- Norman.
Oh, you're hittin' my spot.
Daphne sleep by now, so-
Go around here tellin' everybody “Dahlia.”
Colored women ain't good enough for you no more, huh, Easy?
All you doin' is sniffin' after my friend Daphne.
Colored women ain't good enough for you no more, huh, Easy?
Man!
- Uh-huh.
- Hello. Is this Mr. Rawlins?
Yeah, who's this?
This is Daphne Monet.
You're looking for me.
Who told you that?
You know who told me.
Coretta.
She was found murdered this morning.
I don't know what I should do.
Would you care to talk to me, or is this something I should call the police about?
No, no. Ain't no reason to call the police.
Then why don't you explain yourself to me?
I'm at the Ambassador Hotel.
This part of the hotel is white only,
so go to the side entrance in half an hour...
and Louis the bellboy will sneak you up.
Hello, Mr. Rawlins.
Hello, Miss Monet.
I don't know if I should think of you... as a friend of Coretta's or as a private dick.
Well, I ain't no detective.
No, I was just hired by a fella that, uh, works for Todd Carter.
You know, I had to pay Coretta not to tell you where I was.
Oh, she got you too.
Yeah. Yeah, she definitely gave me the wrong address.
Where did she say I was?
Said you was out in Watts, over to the Skyler
Arms Apartments with a fella named Frank Green.
Mm-hmm. What else did she tell you about me?
What else is there to tell?
Nothing. I make no apology for my feelings for Frank.
He's very dear to me, and that's that. Bourbon?
Please. Straight up.
So how well did you know Coretta?
She was a very close friend.
So maybe you know why she got killed?
Why would I know that?
You said she was a very close friend.
She knew about Frank.
Maybe somebody wanted to keep that secret.
- Mr. Rawlins, if you're thinking...
- You can call me Easy.
Easy, if you're thinking that Frank had anything to do with Coretta's death, then obviously you don't know very much about him.
Frank doesn't go around beating people up.
He prefers to use a knife as his weapon.
And what do you prefer to use as your weapon?
Why don't you search me and find out?
Mind if I have another drink?
Help yourself.
- Listen, Mr. Rawlins...
- Easy.
Easy, the real reason
I called you is because...
I'd like you to drive me to Todd's house.
Beg your pardon?
Well, you've found me, and now I want you to take me to Todd Carter's.
Why didn't you call Carter, have him send for you?
Well, I have to go someplace else on the way.
Someplace that I don't want
Todd to know about.
There's a man named Richard McGee, and he lives up in Laurel Canyon.
And he delivered a letter of mine to the wrong place, and I need to get it back.
At 4:00 in the morning? Must be a pretty important letter.
Yes, it is.
But I need to go there before I go to Todd's.
I'll pay You-
What time you talk to Coretta this morning?
I don't know.
7:30, 8:00, I guess.
Uh, listen, Easy,
I don't-
I don't really want to talk about Coretta just now.
Did you go up to her house?
No.
She called me.
She was in a good mood.
She always, uh...
Look, I didn't mean to upset you, Daphne. I'm-
You understand. I-
As far as I know, you was the last one to talk to her.
And I don't mean to upset you, but as far as I know, you were the last one with her before she got killed.
Now where does that leave us?
All right.
Why don't you go and change out of that housecoat?
I'll carry you along.
Are you nervous?
Nervous? Here I was in the middle of the night...
in a white neighborhood with a White Woman in my oar.
No, I wasn't nervous.
I was stupid.
You make a left up here.
Gettin' Daphne back to Todd
Carter didn't seem so easy.
Who was this guy
Richard McGee?
Just park behind that car.
I'll see ya later, Pop.
Sidney! Sidney!
That's all I've been hearing!
Everybody's doin' things for Sidney! Where are ya?
I'm in here, with Sidney.
In the living room, dear.
I've gotta get rid of that guy.
Oh, hello, dear.
Sit down, Reilly.
Make yourself at home.
Thanks, Moynihan.
Oh, my, you look awful tired, dear.
Yeah, Reilly. Pick out a comfortable chair and plop.
I already picked one out, but you're sittin' in it.
Oh, Reilly, guess what
Sid and I have been playing?
Mmm! Ohh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
♪ All alone ♪
- Hey, who's that at the door?
- It's him.
- Oh, yeah?
- You fought in Europe?
- Easy.
- What you doin' in my house, man?
What happened to your head, hmm?
What the hell are y'all doin' in my house?
Y'all ain't got no right to break into my house.
Where you been this time of mornin', Easy?
I went to see a girl. Why?
You don't get none, Albright?
I didn't come here to play, nigger.
Okay?
That's my money you got in your pocket.
We've been by that address you gave me on Frank Green.
He's already moved from there, a year ago.
What do you want me to do? You don't like the way I'm doin' my job?
I'll give your money...
Believe in God, Easy, huh? I'm curious to see if things any different for a religious man.
Let me show you what I do to people that say they seen things they ain't seen.
- I seen her.
- Where?
- She...
- Come on.
She called me. She had me to carry her up to the Hollywood hills.
- Where is she now?
- She... She took off.
Bullshit.
Where is she now?
She took off.
There's a dead man up there.
While I was lookin' at it, she took off.
Come on in.
Sit down.
Okay.
What she do, take his car?
- Huh?
- McGee.
- Yeah. - If you can write, write down where you picked her up at.
Write it down.
This bologna gets stuck in my... my molar.
I get that with popcorn.
Get me some whiskey, Easy.
Liquor's in the cabinet.
You get it your damn self.
He's got balls.
You gotta give him that.
Shoot him.
No, I'm just kidding.
Oh. Easy, you're a brave man.
I need a brave man working for me.
You're doin' a nice job too, but...
Get me a whiskey bottle.
You gotta find Frank Green, so he can lead us to her.
No, thank you.
Too many people gettin' killed around me already.
Thanks.
Easy, you're connectable to two murders.
You're gonna do whatever I tell you to do.
You find him.
I will be checkin' in.
That's some cheap shit.
Let's go. Come on.
Since Albright liked surprise parties,
I had a friend of my own
I wanted to invite.
I placed a call to
Etta Mae Alexander in Houston.
Told her to get a message to her husband... Mouse.
Cast your vote for Matthew Terell.
Vote for Matthew Terell!
Cast your vote on June 11th for Matthew Terell!
Hey. Easy.
That girl called me last night, Joppy.
- What girl is that? - The one your friend Albright is lookin' for.
Uh-huh.
That's pretty lucky.
No, it wasn't no luck at all, Joppy. It was you.
You and Coretta was the onliest ones that had my phone number... and knew I was lookin' for the girl.
And Coretta was too busy scammin'
Daphne, so it couldn't have been her.
Maybe she looked it up in the phone book.
I ain't in the phone book.
You supposed to be my friend!
Why in the hell didn't you tell the man your damn self?
What the hell you mean lookin' all ugly like you think you gonna do somethin'?
I think
I'm gonna do somethin'.
Hey. Hey!
Stop that shit! You-
Boy! That's my marble! My uncle left me that after he died!
- Goddamn it, he's about to get it back too!
- All right! Let's talk!
- What you got me into?
- She asked me to help her,
'cause I told her Albright was lookin' for her, so I figured I could help you make a few dollars.
She wanted to know somethin' about you, so I told her, gave her your number.
- Where's she at, Joppy?
- I don't know!
- Don't lie to me!
- I am not lying to you!
- What's she runnin' from then?
- She didn't tell me!
Easy. Look at me!
I am your friend.
Now... I didn't mean to get you in no trouble.
I just... I mean...
Look, you... you seen her.
I mean, she is somethin' else, man!
You know what I'm sayin'.
Oh, Joppy...
What?
Like Albright said, when you're mixed up in somethin',
you better be mixed up to the top.
So that's where I was goin',
all the way to the top.
Everybody was peein' on my head and tellin' me it was rain.
Guess they figured I was some new
kind of fool, and maybe I was,
'cause I was ready to start fightin' back.
And I believed that I could live through this bad dream I was havin'...
about pretty girls and gangsters...
and standin' face-to-face with the richest man in town.
- May I help you?
- Uh, yes, ma'am. I'm looking for Mr. Carter.
I'm sorry, Mr. Carter's a very busy man.
Too busy to hear something about that little chippy of his that dumped him?
Excuse me. Mr.-
- Rawlins.
- Why don't you come with me, sir?
Not very smart talking about Mr.
Carter's business to a secretary.
I don't wanna hear it. Too much goin' on for me to give a damn about what you think is smart.
Wait here, Mr. Rawlins.
Mr. Carter will see you.
- Mr., uh, Rawlins.
- Mr. Carter.
- You've heard from Daphne.
- Yeah, last night.
- Uh, is she still in town?
- She was last night.
And... what did she say?
- Wh-What was she wearing?
- Uh... blue dress, high heels.
Mmm. That's her. I'm sorry.
Would you like to come in?
- Mr. Carter...
- Have a seat.
Thank you. I just want some answers.
- Would you like a brandy?
- Thank you.
- I wanna know what I got myself into.
- Beg your pardon?
Well, I wanna know the real reason Mr.
Albright hired me.
- Mr. Albright.
- Yeah, the man you hired to find Daphne.
I think there's been a mistake here.
I, uh...
Who are you talking about?
Wait a minute... You... You didn't hire somebody to find your girlfriend?
Of course not.
As a matter of fact, I thought she was hundreds of miles away from here.
- You say someone's looking for her.
- Yeah.
Someone's looking for her.
Look, Mr. Carter, nothing personal, but wh-what's goin' on between y'all?
Nothing.
We were going to get married and we had a fight, and it is none of your concern,
Mr., uh, Rawlins.
So someone's after her.
Mr. Albright.
- And he says I'm his employer.
- You ever heard of a fellow named Richard McGee?
Who?
Look... I... Why would somebody be after her?
Mr. Rawlins, do you think you can find her again?
It's important.
For her sake.
I'm willing to pay you.
Why'd she leave in the first place?
It's really none of your concern, but
I am willing to pay you to find her.
Okay.
Okay.
- One thousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll take two hundred right now.
I think you're trying to take advantage of me. Let me inform you of something.
The incumbent mayor, the chief of police... close personal friends of mine.
They eat at my house regularly, and my father's house.
That's good, Mr. Carter. Then they can help us find her.
No, they can't.
I'll have Baxter write you out a check.
- Mr. Carter, why you stop runnin' for mayor?
- I'll have Baxter write a check.
All right, why is Matthew
Terell lookin' for Daphne too?
Baxter will write you a check.
I'll take cash.
Here, take it all.
Just take it all.
I'll be in touch,
Mr. Carter.
So Albright had lied to me.
Instead of workin' for Carter, he was workin' for Matthew Terell,
the man runnin' for mayor against Caner.
And, for whatever reason, they was all throwin' money my way to find the girl in the blue dress.
Anyway, I knew that her boyfriend, Frank Green,
hijacked trucks haulin' liquor...
and sold it at half the price to places down on Central Avenue.
So I decided to kick up some dust night in Frank is backyard.
- Good evening, Smoky.
- Good evening. Please.
- Your seat.
- Thanks.
- Now, Mr. Rawlins. What were you saying?
- Frank Green.
- Who?
- I'm lookin' for Frank Green.
- I don't know Frank Green.
- Aw, come on. Why you treatin' me like this?
- I don't know any Frank Green!
- You don't know Frank.
You know me, though, don't you?
Hey, I'm talkin' to my man. He told me to talk to you. Frank Green.
- Who is that?
- What do you mean, who is that?
He told me to talk to you! Now, come on.
- I don't wanna talk about that...
- Well, gimme a beer.
Can I get a beer?
Can I get a beer?
- Give him a beer.
- Thank you.
- Here you go. - Wait, Frank Green told me that you have pints.
- Who's Frank Green? I have no idea who...
- You know who Frank Green is.
- Al! Talk to this man.
- Aw, come on. Y'all know who Frank Green is.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- You don't know Frank Green.
Well, let's get him on the phone. Frank told me-
- Hey, Ezekiel.
- Don't need my trees cut.
They...
Ezekiel.
Ezekiel! Ezekiel!
- Ezekiel!
- What?
There's a man!
Ow! Ow!
Damn! Frank, wait a minute! Wait!
Hold it! Let's talk!
Let's talk, Frank.
Frank, wait a minute! I got $500 for you, Frank! Rich white man wants to-
Aaah!
Aaah.
Hey.
Want me to shoot this son of a bitch, Easy?
- Mouse!
- Huh? Want me to shoot him?
No. No.
It's all right.
What the hell is happenin', man?
- Goddamn, I'm gonna blow your nose off!
- No, wait! Don't shoot him!
Where's Daphne Monet,
Frank?
All right, maybe you don't know, where she is, but, hey, we can help each other find her, man.
- Nigger, you heard him.
- Mouse, no!
- Rawlins residence.
- Sit down.
No, he's busy right now. You're gonna have to call back.
Look.
A rich man is willin' to pay $1,000 just to talk to this girl.
A thousand dollars! That's a hell of a lot of money, man!
- Frank.
- Wait, wait a minute. Let me try.
Now, look here, Frank.
It's-It's Frank, right?
- Yeah.
- Frank.
- What the hell are you...
- Let go of me, man! Let go!
Frank!
Damn it!
Don't you ever grab me when I got a gun in my hand!
Shit.
You got blood on my coat, Easy.
It's a damn expensive coat!
Where's your bathroom at?
In there?
Whew! We gotta find that girl so we can get that money, huh?
Hell, no! We don't have to go find nobody.
I changed my mind. I don't need your kind of help, Mouse.
Boy, look at you.
Man out a damn smile in your neck. You gonna tell me you don't need my kind of help?
This is the same shit you pulled when you killed old man Navrochet.
You ain't even been in my house five minutes, and you done shot somebody already!
- Come on, Easy! Cut me in on this thing, man. - Nah.
Easy, I'm tryin' to do right.
I'm...
I mean, you know, now.
Man, I can help you. You gonna need somebody at your back.
I swear I'm gonna let you run the show.
Let me run the show! I ain't gonna do nothin' you don't tell me to do!
You gonna let me run the show?
- You gonna do everything I say?
- Everything you say.
- That's the wrong hand, Mouse.
- Oh.
- Boy, how you been?
- Easy.
- Who was that on the phone?
- Oh, uh, I don't know, man.
Sounded like some white girl.
Ezekiel. Came to ask you a few more questions.
- So why don't you invite us in?
- I'll come out.
What happened to your neck?
Did I do that?
I don't remember doin' that.
What do you know about a man named Richard McGee?
A dead white man in a cabin over in Laurel Canyon.
He just happens to have a note in his pocket with “Coretta James” written on it.
You feel a little more talkative?
'Cause I'll bet you six bits to a bottle of piss we're lookin' at a double here.
All we gotta do is place you in the dead man's house.
I wasn't in no dead man's house.
We could go down to the station, send a team over here.
Believe me, they'll find somethin' that will place you at that dead man's house.
Evidence has a funny way of showin' up, you know?
Nah, y'all ain't got nothin', 'cause I ain't done nothin', and you know I ain't.
You know a lot more than you're lettin' on.
Tell us, or you're goin' down... for the murder of Richard McGee and Coretta James.
- There's nothin' to tell you.
I don't know nothin'. - Sure you do.
- Let's go. - All right, look.
Just give me a little more time.
- Forget it. - Maybe till tomorrow morning. Maybe I can dig somethin' up.
What d'you think, Jack? We could do that.
Take the cuffs off.
You got till tomorrow morning.
Have a nice evening,
Ezekiel.
I played along, just like the cops wanted me to.
It was all a game to them.
But in the mornin' they'd be playin' for keeps, 'cause a white man was dead now.
And guilty or not, somebody was gonna have to pay for this one.
Hey, man. Is Dupree's sister's house off of Compton Boulevard or Compton Avenue?
- I can't find it. - Don't worry about it. We're goin' somewhere else first.
Oh, did that girl call?
Easy, we gonna go see that girl?
No.
Hey. Ezekiel?
- I been watchin' your house and seein' all them people... - I ain't got time.
- Just leave my trees alone! Okay?
- You got too many trees, man.
- I'm gonna knock a couple down...
- Leave my trees alone!
You can tell me what you think when you get back. All right?
- Who's that?
- Easy.
- What you want?
- Let me in, Junior. It's private.
I ain't got no time. I'm tryin' to get some sleep.
You better go on open this door, Junior.
Act like you got some sense.
- Mouse. - Go on, fool. Get out the way. We ain't got all day.
Have a seat.
- Y'all want a beer?
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.
- What you smokin' there, Junior? Zapatas?
- Uh-huh.
- This one's yours too, isn't it?
- I dunno.
- So why you kill Richard McGee?
- Huh? What you talkin' about?
Ain't no time to play, Junior.
I know you the one killed him.
- You crazy, man!
- Sit down, Junior.
- Tell me what happened, Junior.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about!
The police will, when they find out the fingerprints in that man's house belong to you.
What fingerprints?
What house?
Hattie had you to pull that man outta
John's bar the night I was there, and he was layin' dead with the same suit on and a bullet hole in his head!
- I ain't killed nobody.
- Quit lyin', you big old, sweaty, thickheaded,
- corn bread-eatin'...
- Thickheaded your damn self!
Sit down, Junior.
Go on, sit down now.
Now, you better tell me.
Maybe I'll forget what I know.
Otherwise, I'm gonna tell Mouse to shoot you,
'cause I don't like your ass and he don't like you either.
- I don't even know who you're talkin' about.
- You just had to rob him!
- I didn't touch nothin' in that man's house!
- Goddamn, Junior.
Mm-hmm. Sit down.
Hattie had me take him out to his car.
The man was so drunk he give me
$10 to drive him home.
- I know you took that.
- Hell, yeah.
Then he was askin' me about that white girl you was askin' about.
I told him I seen her with Coretta.
What the hell I care if he knows?
- So you goin' tell him, but you won't tell me. - I don't like your ass, Easy.
- And he give me $50. - Just to tell him that you saw her with Coretta?
No. To deliver a letter. I give it to
Coretta to give to her the next mornin'.
You better be tellin' the truth.
Come on, let's go, Raymond.
- I'm tellin' the truth. I ain't killed nobody.
- All right, Easy.
That man was alive when I left.
I... I didn't kill nobody.
The letter that was so important to Daphne...
had worked its way over to the other side of town...
to Dupree's sister's house in Compton... I hoped.
And Junior was innocent like I Knew all along,
but I couldn't see no harm in lettin' the big water-head sucker sweat a little bit.
- Hey.
- Hey, now.
- Tried to call you.
- Yeah, cops just let me out today.
Sister's gone to work, and I ain't feelin' much like talkin'.
- Raymond!
- Yeah, big man.
- Hey.
- All right, now.
- Them pigs' tails I smell up in there?
- Oh, yeah.
- Lula Mae made some before she went to work.
- Y'all gonna have to excuse me.
Come on.
- Dupree?
- Yeah?
Look, uh...
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Easy.
Why somebody want to kill her like that, man? It don't make sense to me.
Did Coretta... say anything to you about a letter she was keepin'?
Letter?
What kind of letter?
From that white girl.
Nah. But I know it was on account of her that Coretta got killed.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Everything between Daphne and Coretta was always such a damn secret.
That old girl, she didn't think nothin' about two-timin' on Frank.
- You want some more tails, Raymond?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, Dupree.
You know she messin' around with that guy runnin' for mayor, don't you?
- Todd Carter?
- Yeah, Carter. That's his name.
She probably introduced Coretta to one of them guys she knew.
He probably came over to the house, saw that Coretta wasn't that type of woman.
Cops says she fought 'im.
Can you imagine that?
My baby fought 'im.
Fought him 'cause she wouldn't have nobody but me.
God. I can't sleep.
Huh-uh. I still keep seein' her face that mornin' before I went to work.
Junior had just came by the house, and sh-she come runnin' out, carryin' her Bible.
She say, uh...
“Keep this for me, baby.”
- The Bible?
- Yeah.
And the police won't even let me go near the house.
- That's the only thing I got left that belonged to her. - The Bible.
I know it was a sign,
'cause she's so religious.
Oh, God.
It's all right, big man.
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, that's all right.
Get you a drink, now.
Go on, now, drink this.
- All right. All right.
- That's enough, Raymond.
Go on. Drink that.
Let us all say amen.
Amen. Say it one more time.
I was scared now...
and sick from what I saw-
pictures of a much younger
Matthew Terell and children.
Innocent, helpless, naked children.
Mouse.
I got it.
Come on, let's go.
Is you crazy or is you drunk?
- Come on.
- Am I drunk?
You saw me draw that gun. Ain't no man can outdraw me.
- Mouse, put the gun down.
- I'm drunk.
I'm drunk, you right.
Gon' put that gun right there.
We gon' see who's drunk.
Now, watch it.
Watch it! Goddamn it.
Right there now.
Oh, yeah.
This fool gonna call me out, he ain't even got no gun.
- I'll kill that motherfucker.
- No, uh... let him go.
- Hmm?
- Let him live, and he'll be scared of you every time you walk into a room.
Shit, he better be scared, goddamn it, I'll kill him.
- He will. If... If he ain't, I'll...
- You better tell him.
I... I will.
Trust me.
I'll tell him.
- Right there, goddamn it.
- No. Keep an eye on him.
- Where you goin'?
- That's right.
The pictures was eatin' at my pocket like a cigarette burn.
Albright had killed for those pictures, to get 'em back for Matthew Terell.
He had killed Richard McGee, who had sold the pictures to Daphne.
Time was runnin' out.
But I had some unfinished business with the girl.
She had called that afternoon, and all I needed was for her to call again.
Hello. Hello!
Hello.
I'm sorry. I broke into your house, and-
Please don't be angry with me.
Now, why should I be angry at you?
M-May I have a c-cigarette?
You know, Coretta's boyfriend
Dupree got out of jail today.
And you need me to help you find him.
I already got the pictures, Daphne.
You know, I paid $7,000 for those pictures.
They belong to me.
Matthew Terell might have somethin' to say about that.
All right, then, I'll pay you for them.
I'll give you $1,000.
- You gave Richard McGee seven.
- Then I'll give you seven.
Damn, what does Terell have on you, girl?
- Nothin'. You want the money or not?
- No.
No. I got two murders hangin' over my head.
Unless I give the oops a killer by tomorrow mornin', I'm goin' to jail.
- Now, who killed Coretta?
- I don't know.
- It was 'cause of them pictures she was killed, wasn't it? - I don't know.
Your boyfriend Frank Green killed her to bring you them pictures, didn't he?
- Of course not. - Well, you can tell it to the police,
'cause I ain't takin' the rap.
Easy, put the phone down!
Put the phone down!
- Put the phone down. Easy!
- So it was Frank, wasn't it?
- He had nothin' to do with it!
- Yeah, sure he did!
There was more between y'all than back-door romance!
He probably pimped you out to Carter in the first place! We goin' to the police!
- No! No! - Come on! Yeah, why don't you scream, huh?
So I can tell the police about your boyfriend Frank Green!
- Frank is my brother!
- What?
Our mother is Creole.
We have different fathers.
Mine is white.
And that's what
Terell has on me.
And so far, I've been able to keep Frank out of this.
- Who killed Coretta?
- It was an accident.
- Who killed her? - She threatened to sell the pictures to Terell.
Who killed her?
Goddamn it!
I just asked Joppy to go over and put a scare into her.
Joppy?
I didn't mean to hurt anybody!
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
But Todd and his family, you know, they had to pull out of the election because of me.
They really wanted us to get married. It was just because of the election that we-
I'll be a son of a bitch.
Get her, Shariff.
Ow!
No!
Come on, get up.
- Where are the pictures?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah? Take her to the car.
Get up!
Come on! Who we gonna give up to cover this shit, huh?
I woke up Mouse and told him to drive Dupree's car...
to 34th and Central,
'cause it had come to me in less time than it takes to think.
They were takin' Daphne someplace more deserted...
than Albright's office up in Hollywood.
Someplace where there would be no witnesses.
And I was bein' left alive to take the fall.
Mouse, give me one of them guns you got.
- What? - Give me one of them guns.
Start up my car, keep it hot.
I'm comin' out fast.
I saw that cow!
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!
- All right, all right.
- Blow your face off. Let's go.
- Hey, man!
- Shut up!
- What the hell you doin'?
- Shut up.
What is this, Easy?
Just drive, Mouse.
Joppy, Albright's got the girl, and he's gon' kill her.
- Tell me where it is, and you better get it right. - Easy, I don't...
Get it right, Joppy.
Get it right!
There's a-a-a cabin. Th-Th-That's all I know. There's a cabin.
- Where is it?
- It's in Malibu, on Route Nine.
- Make a right turn at the alley.
- Oh, yeah.
You sure this where
Albright's gonna be, right?
- I guess so.
- Don't be guessin', Joppy.
Look. He done this kind of thing out there before, so I guess so.
What's got into you? I thought y'all supposed to be friends.
- He killed Dupree's girlfriend Coretta.
- You lyin'.
No.
- Son of a bitch!
- I done nothin' like that!
No! No! Wait a minute!
Hold on! We need him, Mouse!
The girl got $7,000!
What?
The girl offered to pay me
$7,000 for them pictures.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
How much further is it?
You're comin' up on it.
Raymond, there's some rope in the trunk. Tie him up.
Yeah, all right.
Now, man, come on.
The girl is lyin' if she told you I killed that woman.
- Who says she told me?
- I...
I mean...
Easy, I was goin' to shoot him now, okay?
No, don't shoot him.
Don't shoot him.
Please!
Help me! Help me!
Help me.
Please!
Help me.
- Please.
- Shut up!
Now, you're gonna tell me where the pictures are, okay?
I don't wanna hurt you, but you are gonna tell me. Where are the pictures?
I don't have them.
Easy has them.
I thought you said he had nothin' to do with it.
I was lying.
- What?
- I was lying.
Are you a liar?
Huh? Huh?
I know you're a liar.
You lie about bein' a nigger?
Huh?
Tell me the truth.
What part of you is nigger?
Your leg a nigger?
Your arm a nigger?
Maybe your face is a nigger.
What part of you is nigger? Huh?
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- I don't know. Please.
I'm gonna burn it out of you.
No! No! No! No!
Hey, Easy, is that you?
Hey, Easy!
Easy!
He gone, man.
Gone.
You all right?
Y...
- Yeah.
- Can you walk? All right, come on. Let's go.
Where's Joppy, Mouse?
Huh?
Where's Joppy?
Uh, he right there.
What happened?
I ain't had no time to be tyin' him up, Easy.
What?
- Look, you just said don't shoot him, right?
- That's right.
Well, I didn't.
I just... I... I choked him.
- What?
- Well, how am I gonna help you out... if I'm back here foolin' around with him, now?
Easy, look, if you ain't wantin' him killed, why'd you leave him with me?
Come on, we got to go, Easy.
Easy, come on.
Let's go now.
All right, sweetheart.
Listen, Easy. Think you gonna have trouble with that dude Frank.
I can just run by, kill him and take that evenin' train.
- No, Mouse.
- You sure? All right, then.
- Hey.
- All right. Oh, look here.
I cut you in for half, 'cause I know you was too big a fool... to take your share from that white girl yourself.
All right.
Hey, man. Look.
If you need somebody to run them streets with you again, just give me a call.
'Cause you know how to put some money in a nigger's pocket. Bye.
No, what upset them the most is that I didn't tell them.
And then Terell threatened to go public about my mother, and that just added insult to injury.
But when Todd sees the pictures there'll be nothin' to stand in the way of us gettin' married.
- You sure about that? - Of course.
Terell doesn't want to go to jail.
I'm not talkin' about Terell.
Todd and I are very much in love, and in the end... his family just wants him to be happy.
Daphne had gotten the money out of a locker at the YWCA.
It was money she had gotten from Carter's family.
$30,000...
...to leave town.
She was still convinced, though, that her Negro blood didn't matter...
now that Terell couldn't use it to keep the man she wanted to marry out of the mayor's race.
She was in love and couldn't see for dreamin'...
any better than the rest of us, I guess.
'Cause even though we had fought a war to keep the world free,
the color line in America worked both ways,
and even a rich white man like Todd Caner...
was afraid to cross it.
- Don't walk away. Don't...
- Damn you.
Wait.
Wait.
Please!
Please!
Here's the $800 that I owe you.
And thank you for protecting her.
You have some pictures.
That puts you back in the race.
I'm gonna need you to do something for me too.
I know. You'll have no trouble with the police.
That's a promise.
Thank you.
Mr. Rawlins.
Just so you know,
I do love her.
You want me to walk you inside?
I dropped her off at her brother's apartment,
a fourplex on Dinker Street.
She had told me her story on the way home like a sinner who wanted to confess.
Her name was Ruby Hanks from Lake Charles, Louisiana,
and I suppose all she really wanted was a place to fit in.
A few days later my conscience got the best of me,
and I went by her place to bring back my half of her money.
I was kind of excited about seein' her again.
But when I got there, she and her brother had picked up and gone.
Hey, Easy. Find a job yet?
I ain't studyin' no job, Odell.
Ain't studyin' no job?
How you gonna live?
I got a little money saved up.
Gonna invest in some real estate.
Maybe go into business for myself.
- What kind of business?
- Little private investigatin'.
- You get in trouble doin' that.
- Yeah, well, like a man told me once, step out your door in the morning, you're already in trouble.
Just a matter of whether you're mixed up at the top of that trouble.
Yeah. I guess you're right.
If you got a friend that you know does bad things, I mean real bad things, can you still keep him as a friend even though you know what he's like?
You think that's wrong?
All you got is your friends.
I will. Bye!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doin'?
You better get outta my yard.
You get on out!
Hey! Get on away from there! You know that fool knocked down two of my trees?
Get on away from there!
You better get on!
- You all right?
- Easy, is he crazy?
Always up and down on our street!
If he comes back, you let me know, ma'am.
You take care.
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey, man, get outta the street!
Watch it.
Look at the camera now.
- Kathleen, give me some.
- Okay.
I thought about what
Odell had said about friends,
and it made sense to me.
Odell goes to church every Sunday, so he would know.
Later on, he challenged me to a game of dominoes.
Now, what'd he go and do that for?
We got to talkin' about Texas and fooled around...
and drunk almost' a quart' of whiskey.
And I forgot all about Daphne Monet,
Dewitt Albright, Carter and them.
And I sat with my friend...
on my porch...
at my house,
and we laughed a long time.

I CAN'T SLEEP
France Inter, 6:40.
Many of our listeners aren't young, as your letters show.
There are a lot of old people in Paris.
If you want to live to 100, be careful.
Don't open your door to strangers.
The granny killer is out.
It's in the news.
Follow my advice and remain happy.
Now, some music.
- What can I get you?
- Coffee. Big.
- Sasha?
- This is Alexander Shimetov.
Speak after the tone.
It's Daïga. I'm in Paris. I'll call you back.
Thank you.
- How much?
- 34.10 francs.
Write it down.
Three croissants, a call, and a coffee. 34.10 francs.
One croissant!
No, three croissants, a call, and a coffee. 34.10 francs.
Give me that.
Unbelievable. It's always like that.
It was the same on St. Germain.
Miss!
No parking here. Niet good. No good.
- Pedestrian crossing.
- What are these plates?
- Car plates?
- Lithuania.
Lithuania or not, there are laws here.
Clam up, seal dick.
We'll impound it next time!
Are you asleep?
No.
- That's mine.
- Take it, then.
Is Mona here?
Come on.
Excuse me, miss.
I'd like to open my door.
It's me, Aunt Ira.
- Me who?
- Sharunas' granddaughter.
Daïga!
I didn't expect you so soon.
Come in, come in.
Pick up all your junk.
Bring it all inside. Come in, dear.
You're weighed down like a packhorse.
Good Lord!
All that, too?
Holy Mother of God! Come on.
What else is left now?
That's perfect!
Very good.
You must be worn out?
I came by car.
By car?
Have you lost your mind?
All set?
No, that's Mom's.
- I can't use it, then?
- Go ahead, she left it.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
Can I take a shower?
Help yourself to a towel.
Do you mind me coming?
I never know when you're going to turn up.
Still off to Martinique?
Yes.
There's nothing there.
The trip must have cost you a fortune.
The trip must have cost you a fortune.
The gas and all. What a stupid idea!
Still, we can't judge, of course.
Life is different here.
That perestroika of yours. . .
I don't know where it's got you.
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere, you say?
Exactly. Me, too.
I think it got you nowhere.
More?
Look at you, you're a real beauty.
When you don't know how to do anything. . .
Beauty can be a big help.
What are we going to do with you?
Where are we going to put you?
It's impossible here.
This isn't exactly a palace.
Make yourself at home.
Go on, make yourself comfortable.
What's that? Your belly!
Don't tell me you're pregnant?
Tell me!
It was a big fish.
It's always out of order.
It's a long way to climb up.
Modern technology! What a joke!
I need a rest.
Let's go. You go first.
No one visited.
I hadn't seen her for a week.
- What's going on?
- The police.
- Where are you going?
- The eighth floor.
- Ira, darling!
- Still in bed?
I was just about to get up and shave.
Ow! Your beard.
Come in. It's a pleasure.
Hello.
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.
Go into the living room.
I'll warm up some coffee.
It's yesterday's. Do you take sugar?
No time, Vassia!
And the young lady?
This is Daïga, my great niece.
Welcome.
- She's come from Vilnius.
- On holiday?
Idiot! What holiday?
Like everyone else, she wants to stay.
Vassia, give her a place to stay here.
- Ira, you know I love you.
- So?
Look at the way I live.
The Bulgarian dancer can't even dance. . .
Yet I keep him anyway.
There's the Ukrainian and her daughter.
And that one eating there.
Where can I put her, Ira dear?
- Unless she comes in with me?
- You chatterbox!
In my bed!
She hasn't got a penny. . .
And doesn't speak any French.
Miss, go outside to smoke.
The smell.
I called the police.
Nobody else would have.
I hadn't seen her for a week.
And the flies. . . .
Clear the corridor.
Imagine dying like that.
No one cares about these old people.
What terrible times!
- Okay since this morning?
- I don't know.
Well? Is that all?
A little tired.
Me, too, miss. Human beings are animals.
Goodbye.
What do they want?
They've been tailing me all day.
Lord, that's all we needed!
You're not supposed to be here.
Children sit in back.
If they stop us, we'll both go to jail, you know.
I know.
- Is that your son?
- Yes.
He's cute.
Yes, this way.
What's that?
Is it another book?
- Would you like a Coke?
- Yeah!
I'd prefer a beer.
I'll get you a Coke, I don't have beer.
Mind the wallpaper. I just had it redone.
Thanks.
I'm through. What do you think?
Maybe it was better on the opposite wall, wasn't it?
What do you think?
I really don't know.
It takes up so much room.
- Coming?
- Yes.
Here are the bills for the material.
I haven't been to the bank yet.
- I can give you a check.
- No, no checks.
We said cash.
- Call back tomorrow.
- No, I can't.
I'd put some aside for shopping.
500 francs, 1,000 francs,
1,500 francs, 2,000 francs. There.
We said 3,000 francs.
I've only got 2,000 francs.
3,000 francs or I take it away again.
I could have had a professional for that price.
Come on.
I mean, it's like the black market. . .
If I can put it that way.
It is off the books.
Your turn, Marie-Rose!
To the right, girls. Be nasty!
Kick! Block! Kick! Block!
Knees higher! You're being attacked!
He wants your cash!
One more!
Good, Dédé.
Next move.
Right. Balls, forehead. Let's go.
One! Two! Good. Try it again.
One! Two! Balls! Forehead!
You won't be laughing if it's a killer.
Jacqueline! One! Two! Good.
Come on, ducky. One! Two! Perfect.
The balls aren't that high. Try to remember.
Balls! Forehead! One more.
Go for the nuts, Ginette!
One! Two!
Don't blink, you're being attacked!
It's self-defense.
It's terrible in France.
They slaughter grannies.
Fist! Fist!
Shout! Block!
Fist! Fist! Shout! Block!
And bow like I showed you.
In that dump? That shitty broom cupboard?
It's the dining room!
I need the rooms for guests.
Make your hotel useful for once instead of just getting fat off it.
- What a bitch!
- Am I wrong?
We stand together. We help one another.
We're Slavs.
You can't even put her up!
All right, you win.
I'll have her at the hotel.
Are you fighting?
Dushka, she did the trip in one go.
I'm not worried about her.
Have you seen my letter?
I can't understand Russian.
I wrote here. . .
That I'd like my little niece, whom I don't know. . .
To come to Paris to kiss me before I close my eyes for good.
Is that okay?
Come here.
Feel that?
It's good. I'd have preferred leather.
Let's see.
If you've got 5,000 francs your tuxedo's ready.
Hi, Doctor.
Bye.
Thanks.
This crate's a piece of shit!
You'll see, Paris is great in summer.
Okay, Mom. I'll see to them.
Good. Give me a registration form.
Sit down. Over there, sit down.
You'll see, it's comfortable.
I'll move all this mess. . .
To make room for you.
In fact, it's better than a room. . .
Except that there's no bathroom.
It used to be a dining room, but I closed it.
The guests breakfast in their rooms.
This is for junk now. Come and help me.
We'll make up the bed. Take that.
Put it there.
Quick, grab the armchair.
Put it there.
I'll get you some sheets. . .
And some towels.
There's a shower on the first floor.
A shower.
SHOWERS
- Telephone?
- The phone?
I'll explain. We'll buy you a card for the phones in the street.
Phoning from here is expensive.
Tonight's okay, though.
Is this the number?
It's ringing.
Here.
No reply?
- Not speaking.
- Not speaking?
Tell me, do you know anyone in Paris?
- For work.
- Oh, right.
Be careful here. Really, be very careful.
If you get lost, here's the address.
Hey, boys, how about paying for last month?
Money doesn't grow on trees!
- Tomorrow.
- Every day, it's "tomorrow."
All right, tomorrow.
Have fun tonight.
Try not to behave!
They're so nice. So nice!
Do you want to eat with us?
Mother dines early.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Bitch!
- Don't you find me attractive?
- I'm only human.
- Okay?
- I'm sorry?
- Everything okay?
- Yes, I'm fine. Just fine.
What do you want?
Did I wake you?
It's just a bad dream.
- It's nothing.
- I know.
- Like it?
- Yes.
To the right? Want to see?
Yes.
Like it?
- Comfortable?
- Yes.
Okay?
Not too cold to sleep?
The door was open. I knew you were here.
Sleep.
I came.
So I see.
It's freezing.
What do you want?
I want to be here.
Are you sure?
I'm scared of leaving, Théo.
I want to stay here.
Mona, my mind's made up.
- You don't love me the way I love you.
- I love you the way I love you.
Me, too.
Bring me your photos, Camille.
Come and see me.
Promises, promises.
Anyway, you're no good unless you're naked.
Hello.
- Aren't you staying?
- Stupid.
More horrible news today.
I mentioned the old lady found dead. . .
In her tiny apartment on the rue des Epinettes in Paris.
A famous street.
There was a film once.
Le Costaud des Epinettes.
It's in the 18th District.
Just like the Moulin Rouge. . .
The rue Lepic, the Moulin de la Galette and others.
It's a happy district.
Okay, Daïga, I've finished.
After the sink, scrub it all well. Okay?
Change the sheets on this floor.
We're upstairs.
France is Afraid
Cut it out, Camille!
It's my bed.
Give me that.
Okay, I'll stop.
I'd like to speak to Alexander Shimetov.
Hello, it's Daïga Bartas.
How are you?
Very well, thanks. Can I talk to Abel?
After the rehearsal. Hold on, spell it.
Odeon Theater. . .
Paul Claudel Square.
I have an appointment with Alexander Shimetov.
- Your name, please?
- Daïga Bartas.
Miss Bartas is here.
All right.
I told him, please wait.
Sorry, please not speak fast.
I told him, please wait.
Sorry, we're in a meeting.
- I can't move on that set!
- It's not your problem.
- The blue's no good.
- It's a photocopy, that's why.
I can't choose from a photocopy.
Do a watercolor or something.
Don't make me choose from that.
Hello.
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
Visiting Paris?
- No, not visiting.
- Not visiting.
What do I tell her?
Listen, Sasha, tell her this season. . .
It's complicated. I mean, we're full.
Maybe next year. Next year. . .
In the Russian series, maybe.
Tell her nicely.
Abel's very pleased to see you.
He says he remembers you well. . .
From the course back home. . .
But the play has been canceled this year.
It's put off till next year.
I'm sure he'll take you.
- Are you staying another year?
- Yes.
You'll learn French. You're gifted.
Want a coffee?
Tea.
Sasha, get me a tea, please.
Come on, Daïga. . .
I want to talk to you.
I'll explain. Things aren't simple.
You and I will have dinner together.
Understand?
- Tomorrow?
- No, not tomorrow.
Whenever you want.
You're going to meet people, do loads of things. . .
You'll learn French.
See you.
190 Police Officers to Hunt Down the Old-lady Killers
You were away a while.
- Good appointment?
- Yes, good.
Well, Daïga. . .
Are you leaving us?
Next year, maybe.
Next year, maybe.
You're very pretty, you know. . .
But you dress so badly.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
A smooth face is so beautiful!
You're lucky. Life's beginning.
You can do anything.
If you're broke at your age. . .
It doesn't matter.
Come on, Camille, it's ready.
Take it to your room, honey.
I've got ice cream.
Going skiing?
It was a bargain.
What's that?
For you. You've got nothing for the concert.
If you don't like them, I can exchange them.
No, they're fine.
I can't wear them all day, but I'll get used to them.
They pinch?
No, they're fine. I like them.
My feet look small.
They pinch, they're too small.
I got the tickets.
- You got them?
- Yes, I bought the tickets.
You dropped this.
No, it all dropped on me.
That's mine. Hello, Mom.
You always turn up at the right moment.
Not hungry?
It's too spicy.
You're unbelievable.
I don't know, maybe it's none of my business. . .
But how will you live in Martinique?
In the morning,
I'll take my canoe to go fishing.
Mona will pound manioc for my lunch.
She'll fetch water from the river. . .
One kilometer from the house.
It's all there for the taking.
The bamboo hut, bananas, avocados.
Clothes? Why bother?
You live nude all day there.
Money? No need.
I'll barter.
It's paradise.
Thanks a lot, Théo.
Okay?
Who is it?
Camille, come on in.
My mother's here.
- Okay?
- Fine. He's Théo's brother.
Want some ice cream?
No, no ice cream.
What do you want?
- Have you got a minute?
- What's wrong?
- I want to ask you something.
- Yes?
See you later.
Is he going away with you?
I don't think so.
That child's exhausted.
Put him to bed instead of dumping him there.
Oh, enough!
I'll be back.
- Théo?
- He ran out like a lunatic.
It's not my business. . .
But why doesn't Théo go alone to start off with?
I could take care of the baby.
- I've got nothing else to do.
- Give me a break.
You never stay put anywhere.
You won't stay there.
- Get off my back!
- You're mean.
- I'm coming out with you.
- Family gathering.
- It's all I've got.
- I didn't come for that.
Wait! Where are you going?
- All right, I'm calm.
- Me, too.
- Screw the tickets, I'm staying!
- Okay, fine.
- Wait a minute!
- What for?
I can't keep up!
You say you can't talk to anyone here, but have you tried?
I've waited too long. You'll never be ready.
Whenever we talk, you run to your sister's.
Fucking react!
And that?
- Life will be shit there, too!
- Lf you want.
Fuck off. I'll stay here with the kid.
I've canceled the lease.
Yeah?
I'm going to get him.
Leave him be, you hear me?
- Who is it?
- Mona!
You're back already?
Open up, damn it!
Two fucking days is a record for you and Théo. Pain in the ass.
- Open up!
- This isn't a fucking hotel.
- Jump!
- Cut it out.
What's up? This is new. Scared of me now?
But I proved so many times. . .
That you could count on me, right?
I want to leave.
What do you mean, "I want to leave"?
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean? What's up?
Aren't we good together? What's up?
Are you scared of me?
I love you.
Yeah. Say that again.
- You love me?
- Yes, I love you.
I'd like to leave.
Sure.
You can't get rid of me. You know that?
Know that?
Do you know that?
You know it.
You can't.
- Thank you.
- It's heavy.
Put that there.
Some things are too heavy for me.
Something to drink? Sit down.
You must be tired.
Are you on holiday?
You're not unemployed, I hope.
You don't want this?
- You'd prefer coffee?
- Yes.
I'll make you a coffee. Come on.
Come on.
You're strong.
I'm alone. My curtain rod fell.
I can't open the window.
Could you put it back up?
I'll pay you for it.
I don't know.
You're very kind.
Do you like it strong or weak?
Strong or. . . .
I see what you mean, but how do you define security?
Security is being in a safe place. . .
And knowing it. Or believing it.
It means being reassured.
It's very subjective.
Who can be safe from death?
Thanks, Camille.
Can you describe him?
Yes, sir.
Wait in your room. I'll be right back.
It doesn't matter.
I'm really wiped out.
- Mom.
- Yes?
- Go to bed now.
- No, I can't sleep.
She won't miss a minute.
You really knock it back.
It's my stories.
I know what makes you laugh.
- It's me and my men.
- Yes, stories about men are good.
It's all different now.
I know.
They still move me.
It's true, you know.
I know.
The way they look at me has changed.
Listen to this.
That's lovely.
You're pretty, you know.
Come on, you've had enough.
Do you ever dance?
Listen to that.
I rubbed against a few to this!
You're totally sloshed!
You want to lead? Lead, then.
You can't even stand!
You can't stand up.
My white wine did that to you.
Even sloshed you're pretty.
Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Are you the night watchman?
Got a cigarette for me?
Your hands are cold.
- Have a good night.
- Good night.
Does the tape player come with it?
He asked if you're selling the transistor, too.
And my ass, too?
I'm afraid she can't, it's a family heirloom.
- Is that noise normal?
- What noise?
He says there's a noise.
Tell the motherfucker the noise is part of the deal!
My friend says it's a can of oil. . .
Banging in the trunk.
It's under the hood. It stops when I touch it.
He says it's there.
I can't answer. I don't know cars.
Is he buying or not?
He's into everything Soviet, it gives him a hard on.
Second gear slips.
He says it slips.
I can't answer. I don't know cars.
That's normal. It has to slip.
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.
- She's not selling anymore?
- I don't know.
- What did I do?
- I don't know!
I changed my mind. I'm not selling.
So I translated for nothing?
- It's not mine.
- You stole it?
- Watch the right!
- What right, jerk?
- Are you nuts?
- It's perfect!
Cut it out or I'll dump you here!
Stop it! That's enough!
Fuck you, asshole!
Look out!
- It's not your car?
- You want to kill us?
Let me out!
You rammed the car.
You were reversing, is that it?
- That's right.
- Sorry, that's not what happened.
- She rammed his car!
- You mean, she did it deliberately?
She was raving.
I did it!
- Put a sock in it, you dumb bitch!
- What?
It's nothing dangerous, it's just a foreign language!
I won't press charges. It's my fault.
- Are you sure?
- It's all my fault. I backed up.
- You won't change your mind?
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Come with us, we need to check your papers.
- My car.
- We'll see to that.
No smoking in here, miss.
Ira, I really think it's a stolen car.
Where did you get that from?
She told me that in the car.
- Not me, she didn't.
- What was that?
Nothing, sir, just our language.
Sorry, Inspector, it's our mother tongue.
The young woman is from Lithuania?
From Vilnius, Inspector.
I don't know.
This has nothing to do with me, Inspector.
The rat leaves the ship.
- It is her car?
- Definitely.
Look, Inspector. . .
Can you tell me what you expect from me exactly?
You were with her.
Well, yes. What?
- We have to get her out.
- What?
The cops are all I needed.
Of course. You asked me to help her.
Fine, but. . . .
You fill out papers, sign them, they want your visa.
It's as if you'd committed a crime.
I told them that, at home. . .
When someone falls, they get up again.
You know, like those Russian toys.
Wanke Stanke, tumbler dolls.
What are you talking about?
She works. Don't I work?
I've never had a day's holiday.
Why don't you help her?
You call that work? With the money. . .
You've got stashed away, you could help her if you wanted to.
Miser!
Maybe you give her that hovel for free?
I hope you'll make your place.
We all do, one way or another.
Let me do it.
It's walking, it's walking!
It can walk.
I'll pay for both.
- Théo didn't tell me.
- It's all right.
- Do I wait for Théo?
- Yes. Wait for him.
Tell him I needed Harry, that's all.
- Does Théo know?
- It's okay.
- Wait for Théo, please.
- Okay.
Ramon, shut up!
- Cutie pie.
- Help me.
- Little sweetheart.
- Move it. You're getting on my nerves.
Shit, I've lost my dog. Ramon.
You should have left the mutt at home.
Oh, give me a break!
Ramon!
Poor doggie!
This time, Théo will kill you.
Got your papers?
You've got no ID?
No, not on me.
That looks bad.
Come with us.
What's your name?
Camille Moisson.
Camille, that's a girl's name.
Camille Moisson.
It's okay, I'm clean.
Want a warm drink?
Hot milk?
It's good with crackers.
I don't want to talk.
Let him sleep. Come to the kitchen.
I was worried.
You left Harry alone?
Come on.
Is it shut?
Théo?
Daddy?
Daddy? Come with me.
Come on, look for Daddy with me.
The cops came this morning.
He went with them.
- What cops?
- The cops.
- Where did they take him?
- I don't know.

My brother's a stranger to me, just like you.
Come with me.
You can wait here.
I should have killed you when you left my belly.
I'm the one who's dead!
Mom, stop shouting.
Why did I give birth to you, Satan?
Why did you do this to me?
Mom, please, bring me my things.
Take my suits.
You were such a good little boy. . .
So kind.
English subtitles by Ian Burley
Oh, but this is great.
- Wow!
- Thaùs incredible.
There's gotta be at least seven or eight feet up there.
And 80 years of dust.
Look at all this height.
We could put our bedroom upstairs, and that will leave us with all this space.
- For what?
- Just space.
One, two, three!
- And four?
- Come on.
Four.
And five.
Watch... Watch this.
God, this place is huge.
- Iùs beautiful.
- God.
- You guys, iùs absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.
A little paint.
I'd say you could sell this tomorrow and double your money.
- Carl, you're obsessed.
- A little bit.
Whoa, look.
Hey, iùs an Indian-head penny.
- Iùs a good omen.
- You're the good omen.
Oh, iùs so great.
I had Rose move your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00,
'cause Gary Alan called at the end of the day yesterday and said he has to see you about the final painting bids for the loft.
3:00 is the only time he could make it.
Is that okay?
Sam?
What are you doing?
- Would you relax, man?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
This is not brain surgery you're going into.
Pitching these Japanese guys makes me so nervous.
Sam, you're going to be great. Okay?
I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I mean, I can't very well tell them my
Swedish pom-pom girl joke, you know.
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?
Nice, huh? Molly.
What do you think? Are they me?
Oh, man, look at that. A Testarossa.
I think you ought to pay off your Mustang first.
How you feeling?
Whaùd the doctor say?
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...
- No.
- Yeah.
He said that I shouldn't even be coming in today.
- What about the rash?
- The rash?
The rash is also incredibly contagious.
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No.
- On your genitals again?
- Yeah, yeah. Right on the genitals.
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- You're sick.
- I know.
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning, Carl. Sam.
Hey, Paul.
- Morning, Mr. Wheat.
- Morning, Susan. You are looking good.
Sam.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Here it is.
- Thanks.
- Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning, Rose.
- Oh, listen, the Kobiashi people...
- They're already here.
- They're early.
- I know.
Come here.
Oh, and Andy Dillon called...
- How long have they been here?
- About 10 minutes.
Andy Dillon called and he says he needs $900,000 transferred to Albany by 10:00.
- By 10:00?
- Yes.
Excuse me.
- Carl?
- Yeah?
- Good morning.
- Carl.
Bill, hang on one second.
Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by 10:00.
Can you transfer it to his payroll account?
- Yeah, I'm gonna need your MAC code.
- Okay.
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Okay, thanks.
Yeah. Bill, I'm going to call you back. Okay.
Okay, okay, thaùs fine. Iùs fine. Iùs fine!
Man, iùs too far out.
Can you get this, man?
Where are you guys from, the New York City Ballet?
Almost.
- Saved your life.
- You shit. You scared me to death.
Why did you do that?
Iùs better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the place.
Look out. Look out.
Grab it.
- Sam, Mol, are you guys home?
- Thaùs Carl. Did you invite him?
- Slave labor.
- Carl.
- What?
- Hurry, help.
Oh, my God.
- Near the bottom.
- I got it.
- Now go down.
- What? Just down here?
Yeah.
- Just right here?
- Watch your toes.
I got it.
- Hey, where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.
Good girl.
- God, this place looks great.
- Yeah.
- You like it, huh?
- Like? Like is hardly the word.
I had no idea iùd be this beautiful.
Iùs incredible.
Molly, what about her?
Well, why don't we just leave her there until we get the other stuff in?
- We can figure out...
- What are these?
Oh, let me show you.
Hey, you wanna help me lift this up?
- What, here?
- Yeah.
Wow.
- I just finished it. What do you think?
- Iùs fantastic. I love it.
Sam, whaùs this chair doing here?
- What do you mean? I love that chair.
- I know you love this chair.
- But we discussed this and...
- Yeah, I've had it forever.
I mean just, when I watch TV, I sit in it.
- Baby, this chair is ugly.
- So?
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.
You're right. It does.
- We'll paint it.
- We'll what?
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Whaùs the matter?
- Nothing.
Are you worried about the promotion?
No, not really.
- Then what? Is it moving in together?
- No.
I don't know. Iùs a lot of things.
I just don't want the bubble to burst.
It seems like whenever anything good in my life happens,
I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.
I love you. I really love you.
Ditto.
The piloùs first report of trouble was that he blew the number two engine, the one in the tail of the plane.
It was fully loaded.
Oh, Jesus, another one.
Oh, don't watch that.
I should cancel my LA trip.
These things always happen in threes.
Sam, get serious.
Besides, you lead a charmed life.
Oh, yeah. So did they.
Iùs amazing, just like that. Blackout.
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep.
Boy, I really must have passed out.
- What time is it?
- Iùs 2:00 a.m.
Oh, no. I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.
Well, iùs not now.
- Can I help?
- Yeah.
Put your hands up here. Get them wet.
Now, just let the clay slide between your fingers.
Oh, no.
- Whaùs the matter?
- A glitch. Whaùs up?
The Mark Greenberg and Larry White accounts.
I can't get in.
The MAC code doesn't work.
- No, I changed it.
- You changed it? Why?
Nothing. I just want to nose around a bit.
Is something wrong?
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah, sure.
Whaùs up?
There's too much money in these accounts.
Too much money?
Thaùs impossible. How could there be...
C72273.
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.
It already has taken me hours.
Well, let me take it back and figure it out for you.
No, no, thaùs okay.
Iùs... Iùs like a vendetta now.
- Thanks, though. I appreciate it.
- Okay.
- Lf you start to go blind, just shout.
- Okay.
Listen, I was wondering, what are you and Mol doing tonight?
We're going to the theater.
She wants to see Macbeth.
I think she likes the guys in tights, personally.
- You want to go?
- No, thanks.
I want a full report, though.
- Later.
- Yeah.
Wonderful.
Excellent. Great.
- Well, I loved it.
- Yes.
I was spellbound the whole time.
I could tell.
And so could the rest of the audience with that resonating snore of yours.
Did I tell you what Melissa said?
- Yeah, about six times.
- It wasn't six times.
- Now quit being so blasÈ about this.
- Okay.
Now, this is really important.
I'm gonna have two pieces in her gallery.
The New York Times reviews her gallery all the time.
Molly, The New York Times is just some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school.
So who cares what they think?
About eight million readers, thaùs who.
Nah, they're just reading the sports page.
- Your work is really beautiful. It really is.
- Thanks.
And it shouldn't matter what anyone else thinks. Just what I think.
I want to marry you, Sam.
What? What?
Yep.
I've been thinking about it.
I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think we should just do it.
- You're serious.
- Yeah.
Whaùs that look for?
You never wanted to talk about it.
- Do you love me, Sam?
- Now, what do you think?
Why don't you ever say it?
What do you mean, why don't I ever say it?
- I say it all the time. I feel like...
- No, you don't.
You say, "Ditto," and thaùs not the same.
People say "I love you" all the time, and it doesn't mean anything.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
I need to hear it.
Leùs go.
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.
- What do you want?
- Shit.
Your wallet. Give it to me!
- Sam, just give it to him.
- Okay.
Just take the money. Just leave us...
No, no, Sam!
You son of a bitch!
Sam, no!
Somebody help us!
Jesus Christ! Sam!
Just get off!
Somebody! Somebody help us!
Sam, just let...
Sam, just stop it! Stop it, Sam!
Molly?
Molly? He got...
Oh, baby, hold on.
You're gonna be okay.
Somebody! Somebody!
Somebody help us!
Sam. Oh, my God.
Oh, Sam, come on. Hold on, baby.
Someone's gonna come.
We're gonna be okay.
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Please, anybody.
Help me, please, help me.
Iùs okay, lady. Take it easy, all right?
Oh, God!
We'll help you, okay?
Molly? Molly? Molly?
Molly.
What should we do?
What should we do?
What? Whaùs happening? Whaùs...
Is he breathing?
Is he breathing?
I don't know if he's breathing.
Oh, God, Sam, hold on.
Hold on, baby. Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Come on, man.
All right. Okay, come on, iùs all right.
Here we go.
All right, there you go. One, two...
Sam, don't you leave me! Sam, hold on!
Sam!
Oh, Sam!
...emergency room.
All right. Right away.
Miss Jensen, if you'll step this way, please.
Cardiology, please dial extension 255...
- So, what happened to you?
- What?
You're new, huh? I can tell.
- Are you talking to me?
- Hey, relax.
It ain't like before, you know.
Iùs a whole new ball of wax.
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm waiting for my wife.
She's in 4C, cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.
Shot, huh? Thaùll do it every time.
Poor bastard.
Hey, you may as well get used to it.
You could be here for a long while.
Come here, I'll tell you a secret.
Doors ain't as bad as you think.
Zip, zap, they ain't nothing at all.
You'll see. You'll catch on.
This patienùs fibrillating.
Where's the paddles?
Get them up here.
He ain't gonna make it.
I've seen it a million times.
He's a goner.
- He's still fibrillating.
- Clear.
Clear.
You see? Here they come.
Lucky bastard.
It could have been the other ones.
You never know.
Who are...
Nursing supervisor, dial the operator, please.
Nursing supervisor, dial the operator.
No!
Help me.
Oh, God, help me.
"I am sunk in the abysmal swamp where there is no foothold.
"I have reached the watery depths.
"The flood overwhelms me.
"I am wearied with calling."
As we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit.
All that we treasure, our loved ones, our friends, our body, our mind, are but on loan to us.
We must surrender them all.
We are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end.
As our loved one enters eternal life, let us remember that love too is eternal.
That although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.
I picked up your shirts today.
I don't know why.
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you hello.
I broke into tears.
Iùs like I think about you every minute.
Iùs like I can still feel you.
I'm here, Mol.
Floyd, whaùs the matter, kitty?
Whaùs the matter?
Crazy cat.
Sam?
Thaùs really stupid.
- I love this picture.
- Iùs great.
Office.
Oh, let me see that.
Iùs...
- Sam's address book.
- Right.
Dave Brubeck, Newport, '88.
- Should I toss them?
- No.
No? Molly, we hated that concert.
Hey.
- Oh, you wanted to save those?
- Rolaids?
Molly, what are you doing?
- I just miss him, Carl.
- Me, too.
- Carl?
- Yeah?
Wait a minute. Wait.
- What?
- Not that one.
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to put that on there.
- Thaùs okay.
Hey, Molly, why don't you come?
Iùs like summer outside.
No, I really don't. I... I'm not up for it.
Come on, Mol, just for a walk.
- Iùd be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.
Molly, you can't stay in here all day.
- Iùs not healthy for you.
- Look, Carl, I can't do it!
Molly, you're not the one who died.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.
Shit.
Maybe you're right.
- Maybe just a short one.
- Attagirl.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Molly?
What are you doing here?
You bastard.
You son of a bitch!
What do you want?
Molly?
Molly, get out!
Oh, my God.
No, Molly. No, Molly, no, no. Please, no.
Molly, Molly, he's got a gun. Molly!
Hi, kitty. Hi.
You hurt her, I'll kill...
Molly.
Shit.
Is somebody there? Hello?
Hello?
What are you doing?
Let go! What are you doing?
No!
Like trains?
Stay out! This is mine!
Shit.
Iùs me. I couldn't get it.
She came home.
In a couple of days, man. I'll go back.
Relax, I'll get it.
Get what?
Who are you?
What do you want from us?
No. You stay away from her.
Do you hear me?
You stay away from her!
Rosa Santiago?
Please be seated.
Our sister will be with us soon.
Sister Oda Mae, grant us the gift of your all-seeing presence.
Appear before us now.
Mrs. Santiago?
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
I understand you wish to contact your husband.
I believe he'll be with us today.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
But you know, Mrs. Santiago, there's no telling about that other world.
So you've got to be a believer,
Mrs. Santiago.
- Are you a believer?
- SÌ. SÌ. I believe. I believe.
Then let us begin.
I can't. I can't. Iùs too difficult.
I just can't seem to make contact.
I... I don't feel his... No, wait!
I'm feeling something.
Did he know someone by the name of Anna?
Consuelo? Lucita? Julietta?
Josephina? Linda? Maria?
SÌ, sÌ. His mama. She is Maria.
Yes. Praise God!
I knew he was with his mama.
Oh, my God.
Iùs too difficult. Iùs two of them.
I'm not sure I can do that.
- Iùs so trying... Iùs...
- Oh, I pay more.
- How much? How much?
Oh, way to go. Milk her for every penny.
Yes, I believe we can start again.
Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.
- My husband?
- Have mercy!
Oh, yeah? Where?
- Julio?
- Yes.
I feel his vibration.
I see him!
How is he? How does he look?
Oh, he's a handsome man.
Handsome?
Mrs. Santiago, in our Father's kingdom, we're all handsome.
Oh, Julio.
Julio's coming towards us. I see him!
He's coming! He's there!
He's dressed in a black suit.
Black suit?
Could be blue.
What a crock of shit.
- Who is that?
- Julio?
- Where are you?
- Julio? Julio?
Did you hear it? Damn.
- Where are you?
- Julio?
- Who are you?
- Who?
Julio? Julio?
- You can hear me?
- Don't you hear him?
I don't believe this.
Hey, you! Hey, you!
My name is Sam Wheat.
Listen, can you hear me? Sam Wheat.
Say my name. Say it.
- Leave me alone! Stop it!
- Say my name. Say it! Sam Wheat.
Say my name. Sam Wheat. Say it.
Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.
Sam Wheat!
Jesus.
- Sam Wheat?
- Sam Wheat?
I swear, no more cheating. I promise.
I'll do anything. I'll do penance.
Give me penance, but make that guy go away.
No way.
Iùs okay.
Iùs okay.
All right, Sister.
- I can't...
- Yeah, you're all right.
My mother had it.
And my mother's mother had it.
They... They both had the gift.
And they always said I had it, but I never did. I never had it.
They told me what it was like.
They told me all about it.
But now that I got it, I...
I don't think I want it.
So, do me a favor, just go away.
Find somebody else.
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.
Yeah, I'm getting there fast.
Well, I think she hit her head harder than we think.
Well, she was talking to nobody that wasn't there before she even hit her head.
Well, I know she is.
But you know, Sister can do that.
- Where exactly are you?
- I'm standing right beside you.
- Oh, you're standing right beside me?
- Well, honey, we're right here.
- Are you white?
- What?
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?
Oh, God, you know what I think?
Yes, I'm gonna call the doctor right now.
- I knew it. Iùs a white guy. Why me?
- Listen, damn it.
You are going to help me.
There's a woman.
Her name is Molly Jensen, and she's in terrible danger.
The man who killed me broke into our apartment and he's gonna go back.
So you've gotta warn her.
Just what makes you think she's gonna listen to me?
Iùs just a phone call.
Look, you're all I've got.
Now, I'm not leaving until you help me.
I don't care how long it takes,
'cause I can talk forever.
She's talking to white people in the room.
- Hello?
- Hi.
- Is this Molly Jensen?
- Yes.
Well, my name is Oda Mae Brown.
I'm a spiritual reader and advisor, and a friend of yours gave me a message for you.
Now, I know this is gonna sound a little crazy, but iùs not, and you gotta believe me.
Just don't be afraid.
Who is this?
I got a message from Sam.
What?
Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.
- I told you.
- You gotta go there.
Forget it. I'm not going anywhere.
I don't care what you do.

I'll go anywhere you want to!
Just don't sing anymore!
I can't believe this.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
What am I doing down here?
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.
She's probably not even there.
Where are you?
Which building is it?
- Which one?
- Push three.
- See? Nobody's there.
- She's there. Just wait. Just wait.
Look, no. I came down here,
I did everything I said I was gonna do.
I pressed the button. She's not there.
I'm gone. Goodbye.
- Just wait one minute.
- I'm sorry.
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
Ninety-nine bottles of beer

All right, don't sing!
All right, all right, all right!
- Hello?
- Yes, hi.
She can't hear you.
Hi, I'm Oda Mae.
You know, I called you last night about your friend Sam Wheat.
I told you.
Hey, Molly!
Molly Jensen, I know you're up there!
I know you hear me! I'm down here!
Sam wants to talk to you!
This is for real!
Hey, you remember the starfish in Montego Bay?
How would I know that if he wasn't here?
Hey, Molly!
I know about the green underwear that you wrote your name on!
I'd never get over that, I'll tell you that.
I know about the picture in Reno.
Hey, Molly!
Ask her about the sweater she knitted, in the closet, thaùs too big.
He just asked me to remind you of the sweater thaùs in the closet that you knitted is too big!
Four sizes!
Hey, you hear me talking to you?
- I hear you.
- Oh, shut up. Nobody's talking to you.
Didn't you ever hear of a phone?
Wanna kiss my butt?
- I'm not gonna stay down here all day!
- Thank God.
Oh, man, shut up!
Molly!
I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm out of here.
One, two, three.
- No, Oda. Wait.
- No.
Iùs Molly.
Molly?
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
I don't know you.
I don't know this guy, Sam.
But let me tell you what he did to me.
He kept me up all night singing
I'm Henry Vlll, I am.
Thaùs how he got me to go out with him.
Look, I'm sorry.
I just don't believe in this life-after-death stuff.
- Well, tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.
- You're talking to him right now?
- Yeah.
He just asked me to tell you that you were wrong.
- So, where is he?
- I can't see him. I can only hear him.
I'm right here.
That doesn't help, Sam.
I'm holding her hand.
He says he's holding your hand.
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing to me?
Hey, look, if you think I'd come all the way down here for my health, you're out of your mind.
Sam's dead. Okay? He's dead.
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.
Sam would never say that.
Ditto! Tell her ditto.
What the hell is ditto? Ditto!
Man, to tell you the truth,
I don't know how I'm doing this.
You know, confidentially, nothing like this has ever happened to me before.
I mean, nothing.
And now I can't turn it off.
Is this him? Is this you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Cute. White, but cute.
What I don't understand is why did he come back?
- I don't know.
- Why is he still here?
He's stuck, thaùs what it is.
He's in between worlds.
You know, it happens sometimes.
The spirit gets yanked out so quick that the essence still feels like it has work to do here.
- Would you stop rambling?
- I don't think I'm rambling.
I'm just answering her question.
- He's got an attitude now.
- I don't have an attitude.
Yes, you do have an attitude.
We're having a little discussion.
If you didn't have an attitude, you would not have raised your voice to me, now, would you?
- God damn it, Oda Mae.
- Don't you "God damn it" me.
Don't you take the LorÔs name in vain with me, you understand?
- I don't take that.
- Would you relax?
No, you relax. You're the dead guy.
You want me to help you?
You better apologize.
- Because I don't take that from anybody.
- Jesus Christ!
- Thaùs it, I'm leaving.
- What are you doing?
I'm leaving. Nobody talks to me like that.
You understand me?
- Now you better apologize.
- I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay?
Now would you sit down? Please?
He's apologized.
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying, but you have to tell her word for word, all right?
- Word for word.
- Yes.
He wants me to tell you what he's saying word for word.
Molly, you're in danger.
Now you can't just blurt it out like that.
And quit moving around, will you?
'Cause you're starting to make me dizzy.
I'll just tell her in my own way.
Molly, you in danger, girl.
What are you talking about?
I know the man who killed me.
He knows the man who killed him.
His name is Willie Lopez, and I know where he lives.
His name is Willie Lopez.
He's Puerto Rican.
He knows where he lives.
- Write it down.
- He wants you to write it down.
- You write it down.
- I ain't no damn secretary.
Just do it!
He's so testy.
What is it you want me to write?
Iùs 303 Prospect Place, apartment 4D.
- 303 Prospect Place?
- Yeah.
Thaùs my neighborhood.
Molly, he's got my wallet, he's got my key, and he was in here.
He's got his wallet and his key, and he was in here.
Yesterday when you came back from your walk with Carl, you went up the stairs, you talked to Floyd,
- you went in, took off your clothes...
- All right, all right.
When you came in yesterday from your walk with Carl, he was here.
You took your clothes off.
He saw everything.
Molly, you got to go to the police.
It was a set-up.
I was murdered.
He wants you to go to the police.
He said it was a set-up.
He was murdered.
- There's somebody else involved.
- Look, forget it.
- I don't know who, but...
- I don't want no more
- to do with this, okay?
- Wait.
- Where are you going?
- What do you mean, where am I going?
I'm leaving.
I did everything I said I was going to do.
And don't be following me,
'cause I'm finished. And I mean it.
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death. Goodbye.
Molly, there's no one on earth besides you who'd want this to be true more than me.
But you've got to be rational about this.
I mean, Sam is no more in this room than...
Look, I understand the need to hang on to him.
I really do. But this is absurd.
I know this seems absurd.
But it had to be real.
How could you believe some fortuneteller from Brooklyn who just shows up at your door?
I sat there and watched her have a conversation with him.
I don't buy it, Mol. Not for a minute.
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?
The photo that Sam took of me on our trip to Reno.
Carl, we were alone.
And the green underwear that I wrote my name in.
- She said Sam knew who killed him.
- Yeah.
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.
We're going off the deep end here.
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly, good.
Willie Lopez.
303 Prospect Place, apartment 4D.
This is sick.
Oh, Carl.
This is really sick.
Oh, God.
Molly, I don't understand how you could swallow this crap.
I mean, this guy may not even exist.
This woman, maybe she's just trying to use you to set someone up.
You're right. You're absolutely right.
No.
Thaùs what I got to find out.
What do you mean, find out?
How are you gonna do that?
Well, she said Sam wants me to go to the police.
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus, Molly.
Are you out of your mind?
I mean, what are you gonna tell the police?
Are you gonna tell them that some storefront psychic lady's been communing with the dead?
I mean, do you have any idea what that sounds like?
You're talking ghosts here, for Chrisùs sake.
I'm sorry.
Iùs just this stuff just really gets to me, you know.
Iùs okay if you don't believe me.
I'm trying to, Molly.
Look, if iùll make you feel any better,
I'll go check this out, okay?
Now, why don't you try and get some sleep?
Okay? All right?
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.
All right. Good night.
Be careful.
Carl. What the hell are you doing here?
Who have you been talking to, Willie?
Talking to? What the hell do you mean?
Some woman knows all about you, everything.
- Now where's she getting it from, huh?
- I haven't said a word to anybody.
She knows your name, God damn it.
She knows where you live.
- A lot of women know where I live.
- This is not a joke!
She knows about the murder.
Now I want you to find this bitch, whoever she is.
And I want you to just get rid of her, okay?
I've got $4 million stuck in a goddamn computer.
If I don't get those codes, if that money is not transferred soon,
I'm... dead. We're both dead.
Why don't you tell them you only launder money on the first of the month?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Is everything a joke? You killed a man.
You were supposed to steal his wallet.
Was that a joke?
Man, I did you a favor, man.
That was a freebie.
Look, these are drug dealers, okay?
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
I'd lose my job. I could go to jail.
$80,000 of that money is mine.
Look, just let me have the key to Sam's apartment.
I'll get the address book myself, okay?
Bastard! You goddamn bastard!
Why? Why? You were my friend!
I had a life, God damn you. I had a life!
Look, I don't even believe in this stuff myself.
But she was real.
What? You think I'd come down here if it wasn't real?
You know, you told me if I had any new information that I should come.
So here I am.
I know how this sounds.
I mean, I hear myself saying it and I want to cringe.
But this woman knew things she couldn't have known.
Things Sam only said to me.
Okay, according to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place, watching us all the time, huh?
Well, hell, I'm never gonna get undressed again.
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.
All I'm asking you to do is check it out.
Okay.
You just wait here and let me see if the guy's got a record, all right?
Great.
What are you doing?
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for a Willie Lopez.
He was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with.
Now, this psychic woman's got a record that goes back a long way.
1967, Shreveport, forgery, selling false ID.
Served one year in 1971.
Baton Rouge, arrested for fraud.
Numbers racketeering, served 10 months, 1974, and...
Look, this is impossible.
- It goes on and on.
- She knew things. Private things.
Now, how could she have known all that?
A lot of times they read the obits.
All she had to do was see the word "banker." Boom.
Hell, they even go through your garbage to find things they can use.
Letters, old papers, it doesn't take much.
No.
It was real.
She knew about a sweater I knitted.
And songs we sang.
Our trip to Montego Bay.
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.
People want so much to believe.
They're grieving. They're vulnerable, and they will give anything for one last moment.
Believe me, these people know what they're doing.
And I know how you must feel, but you know you can press charges.
No.
Thank you.
Oh, God, let this be it.
Yes.
Hello?
- Eddie?
- Yeah.
- Iùs Carl Bruner.
- Whaùs up?
I'm fine. Yeah, everything's fine.
Just, we're all set.
Good.
Just let me know what you want me to do.
Okay, I want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name Rita Miller.
Okay.
Tomorrow at five minutes before closing, 3:55 p.m., transfer the full account to the First Island Bank of Nassau, registry number 4869580.
- Call us when iùs done.
- Okay, I've got it.
Just tell Mr. Balistreri that there won't be any more problems, okay?
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Thank you.
Good work, Carl.
Molly, why can't you hear me?
I need you.
- Who is it?
- Iùs Carl, Molly.
No. Don't open it, Molly.
Don't open the goddamn door.
He's a murderer.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Listen, sorry, I know iùs late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I just...
I've been thinking about you all day.
And I feel really lousy about...
About what happened last night.
This supernatural thing just really...
Listen, don't worry about it.
Really, iùs okay.
No, iùs not.
You needed me to hear you and I didn't.
I wasn't there for you, and that was...
That was wrong.
Iùs just I... I just...
I want you to know that I'm your friend, Mol.
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never our friend.
- That really means a lot to me.
- Me, too.
So I brought you some Japanese apple-pears.
I know you like them.
Thanks. Thaùs very sweet.
Could I come in for a second?
I won't stay long.
Iùs just been one of those days.
- Maybe a cup of coffee or something?
- Yeah.
- Come on in.
- No, Molly.
- You seem a little tense. Are you okay?
- No, I'm fine.
Iùs just, God, what can I tell you?
Iùs been tough.
Iùs... I mean, you know, it just still hurts so much.
You lying snake.
And then on top of it, iùs stuff at work.
They've given me my own accounts, which is good.
But I just haven't really had time to adjust, kind of absorb everything.
Iùs no big deal.
Yeah.
- Can I have just a little more cream?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit. Jesus. I can't believe I did that.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, God.
- Here, let me throw that in the washer.
- No, don't worry about it. Iùs okay.
Iùs just...
- You want me to get you another shirt?
- No, iùs fine. Iùll dry.
- Just take a minute.
- Here you go.
So where were you today?
I thought you were gonna come into the bank and sign those papers.
Well, I was supposed to, but I didn't have time.
I went to the police.
You did? Wow, what did you tell them?
What did they say?
It was awful.
I felt really stupid.
They brought out a file on this woman, and... At least 10 inches thick.
- A rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly.
You know, the sad thing is that I believed her.
Molly, sometimes we need to believe.
Why? Whaùs the point?
Molly, it is not easy to face the realities of life.
Sometimes you've gotta give yourself that.
What you've got to remember is the love that you guys felt.
I mean, thaùs whaùs real.
You've got to remember how good Sam was, how much he loved you.
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.
I feel so alone.
You're not alone, okay?
You've got your work.
You're incredibly talented. You're young.
You're fantastically gorgeous.
I don't know whaùs real anymore.
I don't know what to think.
Just think about Sam.
Think about the time you guys had together, how wonderful that was.
Yeah.
Let your feelings out, Molly. Iùs okay.
Life turns on a dime.
You know?
I mean, people think that they have forever, that there's always gonna be tomorrow, but thaùs bullshit.
Sam taught us that.
You have to live for now, for today.
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Iùs okay.
- I can't. Iùs just too soon.
- Iùs okay.
You've been great, Carl.
- But I need you to leave.
- Iùs okay. I understand, totally.
Please.
Could we just have dinner tomorrow night? Just talk.
Can I interest you in that?
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.
Hey.
- Get off my train.
- No.
Get off! Get off!
Get off! Get off! Get off!
- Get out of here. Get off.
- No.
Show me how you do that.
I want to learn, and I'm not leaving till you teach me.
- Get off!
- No.
Get off!
You stubborn asshole.
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I...
You're trying to move it with your finger.
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.
Iùs all in your mind.
The problem with you is you still think you're real.
You think you're wearing those clothes?
You think you're crouched on that floor? Bullshit!
You ain't got a body no more, son.
Iùs all up here now.
If you want to move something, you've got to move it with your mind.
You gotta focus.
You hear what I'm saying?
How? How do you focus?
I don't know how you focus.
You just focus.
- How did you do that?
- You gotta take all your emotions, all your anger, all your love, all your hate, and push it way down here into the pit of your stomach.
And then let it explode like a reactor.
Okay, okay.
Don't laugh!
Way to go, kid!
I did it.
- I did it.
- Way to go.
From your gut, like I told you.
Give it time. What else have you got?
How long have you been here?
Since they pushed me.
- Someone pushed you?
- Yes, someone pushed me.
- Who?
- What, you don't believe me?
You think I fell? You think I jumped?
Well, fuck you!
It wasn't my time.
I wasn't supposed to go!
I'm not supposed to be here!
Oh, I'd give anything for a drag.
Just one drag!
Are you all right?
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Yes!
...so you need to concentrate,
'cause if you concentrate, you'll probably rouse him.
- Now whaùs his name again?
- Orlando.
Orlando.
Orlando, Orlando, is there an Orlando here?
- I'm here.
- He's here.
- Oda Mae, I...
- Sam!
- What the hell?
- Excuse me, I'm Orlando.
The line's over there.
Oda Mae, where did all these ghosts come from?
- You can hear them, too?
- Hear them? Can I hear them?
I hear them in the morning.
I hear them in the evening.
They're coming into the shower.
Sam, what the hell did you do to me?
Did you tell every spook in the world you met about me?
I got spooks from Jersey coming in here.
Jesus.
There's stuff going on you wouldn't believe.
I don't even believe it.
- Iùs amazing. You're really doing it.
- Yes, I know.
How do you like that?
- Can you two please hurry this up?
- Oh, chill out. Chill out!
Listen, I need your help again,
Oda Mae.
- There's something we need to do.
- No.
I'm not doing anything else with you, Sam.
Look, you're holding onto a life that doesn't want you anymore.
It doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.
Are you speaking to me?
Does it look like I'm speaking to you?
You'll know when I'm talking to you.
You supposed to be concentrating, aren't you?
Now, you want to try it?
Thank you very much.
Now, Sam, are you gonna get out of here?
'Cause I got work to do.
Fine, then stay there.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You ready now?
Leùs do it.
Oda Mae, listen.
I got to talk to you now. I've got a plan.
You see, I figured this thing out.
There's something we can do.
All we got to do is...
Oda Mae?
Oda Mae?
Ortisha?
Orlando? Is that you?
Ortisha, where are you at?
I can't hardly see.
- Here. She's here.
- In front of you. I'm right here.
Damn, baby!
Whaùd you do to your hair?
Orlando, you like it?
Iùs Autumn Sunrise.
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!
Don't you ever do that to me again.
Orlando!
- I can barely move.
- Now, you should know better than that.
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.
Everybody out!
What happened to Orlando?
Where's the insurance policy?
Are you deaf? I said everybody out!
Everybody out! Get out, get out, get out!
Everybody get out!
Get out!
- You the fortuneteller?
- Who are you?
Thaùs an interesting question.
Why don't you tell me?
- Willie.
- Willie?
Prospect Place Willie?
Get out of here! Fast!
- Sister! Sister!
- Oda Mae!
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Oda Mae, we're in trouble, so you've got to help me.
What do you mean we? Who's we?
You're already dead.
Don't you understand?
These people are trying to kill me.
Yeah, you're right. And they'll be back.
Look, why don't you just find a house to haunt, you know?
Get some chains and rattle them or something.
Will you listen to me?
I have a plan and it will work.
But you've gotta get some of your fake IDs.
Forget it.
If you do this, they'll never bother you again, I promise.
Scouts' honor.
All right.
What do I have to do?
What exactly do I have to do?
You got a nice dress?
I don't see whaùs wrong with what I'm wearing.
I'm sorry I made a joke.
I love your shoes.
No, I don't think you do.
You know, I think I'm gonna go home.
I'm going home because
I don't know anything about banking.
I don't know that this is gonna work.
- Oda Mae, would you just relax?
- Listen, I'm nervous.
Please donate.
I know you're nervous, but I will get you through it.
- And the fake driver's license is great.
- Oh, Sam, I don't think I can do this.
You can do it. Straight ahead of you.
A stairway that says, "New Accounts."
- Thaùs where we're going.
- I'm not giving them no money.
- Just do what I say and don't talk.
- Okay.
Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm here to fill out a signature card for a new account.
And do you know your account number?
- Rita Miller.
- Who?
- What?
- Tell her Rita Miller.
Rita Miller.
Didn't they have you sign a card when you opened the account?
Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today.
You see, Carl Bruner, he opened it for me by phone, that account, and now he's asked me to come in today.
I see.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
All right.
Just sign this card on the bottom line, please.
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.
No, no, no! Rita Miller.
I'm so sorry.
You know, I... I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.
Now, tell her to make sure it goes straight up to the third floor file, because you have a transaction to make.
Please make sure this goes right up to the third floor file, because I have a transfusion to make.
- A what?
- Leùs go.
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.
- I just love these pens.
- Then keep the pen.
- Why are you always making me...
- What do you want to keep the pen for?
- Carl Bruner speaking.
- Hi, Carl.
- Mr. Balistreri.
- Balistreri?
- Carl, iùs me, John.
- John, John. Sorry.
What... What... Whaùs up?
I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio.
Oh, right, okay, look, I'll just...
I'll pick it up later. All right?
- All right. I'll be here till 6:00.
- Good.
This is it.
I don't suppose I can talk you into losing the hat.
You keep messing with me, you'll be here by yourself.
Tell the guard you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.
Lyle Ferguson.
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I'm here for my health.
Don't say that.
Tell him Rita Miller's here.
You just tell him Rita Miller's here.
Just one moment, please.
Don't embellish.
Excuse me?
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.
I've known him for five years, and he still thinks my name's...
- Why are you whispering?
- Just be quiet and listen.
He's a social moron, so you don't have anything to worry about.
Just tell the guard Ferguson knows you.
You spent time with him and his wife, Shirley, at the Brewster's Christmas party last year. Got it?
- What is this in regards to?
- What?
He doesn't remember me?
Oh, we spent all that time at the
Brewster's Christmas party last year.
He and his lovely wife, Shirley.
It was beautiful.
A big old tree and thousands of presents everywhere. It...
Gas.
I get a little gas from time to time.
Thaùs all. Gas.
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it.
Now, listen, this'll be easy.
Ferguson was so drunk at that party, he coulÔve had a conversation with Tina Turner and he wouldn't remember.
- I don't know, Sam.
- Here we go.
Hello. Hello. Yes.
Of course, yes.
Well, iùs been a long time.
Oh, a long time.
Ask how Bobby and Snooky are doing.
By the way, how are Bobby and Snooky doing?
Fine. Fine. Thank you.
Thank you for asking.
And how is your family?
Oh, couldn't be better.
Well, wonderful.
Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities.
I was just wondering, how did you do on the Gibraltar securities?
The Gibraltar securities?
Well, it looks like we topped out on that one, huh?
- We sure did.
- We sure did.
- That was a very useful tip.
- Good old Randy.
- Good old Randy.
- Right.
Got a good old head on his shoulders.
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.
Yeah. So, what...
What brings you here today?
- You're closing an account.
- I'm closing an account.
Well, wonderful.
Do you have your account number?
- Yes?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Good.
Well, Rita, it looks like you'll be withdrawing
$4 million from us today.
- $4 million?
- Say yes. Say yes!
- Is that correct?
- Yes.
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
- Thaùs correct. Yes.
- Easy, easy.
Yes.
Well, how would you like that?
- Tens and twenties.
- Pardon?
Cashier's check.
Tell him a cashier's check.
I think better, a cashier's check.
A cashier's check. Fine.
Well, of course, you know, we require identification from everyone.
- Iùs just procedural.
- Oh, ID! Yes.
You know, I...
Thank you. Well, I'll be right back.
$4 million!
Yeah, get me the First Island Bank of Nassau. Iùs on the Rolodex.
Well, we have some things for you to sign here.
This officially closes the account.
And here you are.
Now, sign Rita Miller.
Rita Miller. Thaùs my name.
My name. Rita Miller. My name.
My name.
- Molly, hi. Iùs good to see you.
- Hi.
- Oda Mae, I'll be right back.
- A few more if you would, please.
Just anywhere?
Right here.
Fine.
The check.
This... Here you are.
The person you need to see is right down at the end.
Okay, thanks.
Mama took the money that she made in the oil wells, and she sunk it into gas pumps.
You know, how they have at the gas station?
And those gas stations have five or six of those things, so iùs very, very lucrative.
- Oda Mae.
- It really adds up.
- Oda Mae, we've gotta go. Say goodbye.
- Well, gotta go now.
Iùs been a pleasure doing business with you, a real pleasure.
Now, may I keep the pen?
Say good night to Bobby and Snooky for me.
I'll see you. Bye-bye.
Why are you rushing me?
What is wrong?
- Excuse me. Lyle?
- Oh, yes...
- Molly Jensen.
- Molly.
The woman you were just doing business with.
- Yeah?
- What did she want?
I mean, did it have anything to do with me or with Sam?
Sam? Why, no. No.
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right?
- No, her name was Rita Miller, and she was closing an account.
- Why? Is there a problem?
- No. I guess not.
Thank you.
Carl, is something wrong?
Is somebody playing with the computers?
- What?
- One of my accounts is closed.
Which account? Whaùs wrong?
You want me to call someone?
No, iùs okay. I can do it. I got it.
$4 million!
Oh, my God, what am I gonna do with this money?
I... You know,
I'm gonna buy the building.
No, no, wait. I'm gonna buy the block.
I'm gonna make my sister go to a fat farm, because, you know, she's way too big.
Whoa, wait! What are you gonna do...
Then I'm gonna...
Yeah, I'm gonna buy the building.
Wait, wait, wait, Oda Mae,
I've got an idea.
- Take the check out of your purse.
- Oh, you're right. You're right.
I should take it out.
I should put it where nobody can get it.
No, no, no. Endorse it.
No, if I endorse it, then if I drop it, somebody will get it. No, I'll just...
Iùs not your money.
I never said you were gonna get the money.
This is blood money.
I was killed for this money.
- Now, endorse the check.
- I know, but...
Well, Sam, what are you gonna do with it?
Look over there, to your left.
I know you don't think I'm giving this
$4 million to a bunch of nuns!
Oda Mae, if you don't do it, they will track you down.
Your only protection is to get rid of it.
Oh, Sam, come on. You're killing me!
Iùs $4 million!
Just think of it this way, you'll go to heaven.
I don't want to go to heaven!
I want to go to a bank and cash the goddamn check!
- Hello.
- Yeah.
- You'll thank me later.
- How are you doing?
- Now, endorse it Rita Miller.
- I know.
Make it out to St. Joseph's Shelter.
I can't believe you're making me do this.
Now, give it to her.
I will, I will. I just want to feel it one more time in my fingers, thaùs all.
- Just give the lady the check.
- I will!
Hand her the check. You can do it.
- Give her the check.
- I will.
Bless you, child. Bless you.
Give it to her. Let go. Let go!
Shit.
I'm proud of you, Oda Mae.
You know something, Sam?
I don't care if you're proud of me.
You stay away from me from now on.
What is that nun going to do with it?
She can't even buy underwear. Nothing.
I hate you. Leave me alone.
Never talk to me again.
I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.
Go ahead, search. You'll never find it.
They're gonna kill you, Carl.
You and Willie, you're gonna be fertilizer.
They're gonna bury you right next to Jimmy Hoffa.
Who's doing that?
Who's doing that?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.
I know, Mol. I'm sorry.
Things got a little crazy. I just forgot.
Yeah, had a little trouble at the bank.
- You forgot?
- Yeah.
You know, I wish you would have called me, because I've been really worried.
Listen to me, Molly,
I gotta ask you about something.
Yeah, he needs to borrow $4 million.
When you said that you thought that Sam was here, that he was talking to you, what did you feel?
What did he say to you?
Why? What does that have to do with anything?
Iùs just... Listen to me for a second.
This psychic lady,
I want to know what she told you.
- I wanna know exactly what she said.
- Carl, let me go. Carl, stop this.
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.
What the hell happened to you tonight?
Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today?
The bank?
Yeah, Ferguson said she closed an account.
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
Iùs Rita Miller or something.
Carl, are you all right?
Iùs just my stomach...
Jesus.
Do you have any, like, I don't know, some Pepto-Bismol or something?
- Cyanide.
- Yeah. Iùs upstairs.
Why don't you sit down, and I'll get it?
Whaùs wrong? Does little Carl have a little tummy ache?
What are you doing to me?
Now do you believe in ghosts?
I'll set the place on fire, I swear to God.
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl.
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.
I need that money, and I want it tonight at 11:00.
If that psychic lady does not bring it here,
Molly is dead. Okay?
- Carl, who are you talking to?
- Nothing. Now, Molly, listen to me.
I have to go, okay?
I can't explain this now, but there is a problem, okay?
- Something's going on at the bank.
- Carl, you're really scaring me.
I'm sorry, Mol.
Look, I don't have time to talk now, but I'll come back about 11:00.
- Why? Why not now?
- Molly, I can't talk now.
Molly, look, I'll come back.
What do you say? Like, 11:00, okay?
I'm sorry to do this to you, Molly, but iùs really important.
I gotta go. Okay?
- Oda Mae!
I'm Arsenio Hall.
Don't try to adjust your television.
I'm black.
- I want to watch Love Connection.
- I love Love Connection.
- I love that man on there.
- Leave that! Thaùs Arsenio.
- So?
- What do you mean, so?
You love Love Connection, you ought to send your picture in there.
She did already.
They just haven't answered yet.
- Oda Mae?
- Sam?
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Oda Mae, we're in trouble.
They want the check, and they're coming for you.
So you gotta get out of here.
What do you mean, they want the check?
The check you said they would never know about?
- Oda Mae, whaùs happening?
- Sam.
They're here! They're here!
Get out of here! Now! Go!
- Come on. We gotta go!
- Whaùs the matter?
Come on, come on!
Just knock on the door here.
Help! Help!
- Iùs an emergency. You gotta let us in.
- Who are you kidding?
Open up!
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.
The cat don't like visitors.
She'll pee all over that...
They're gonna get us.
Where's Sam?
- Shit! It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.
Carl?
Shit!
Willie!
Hey, man, you got a serious problem, man.
Help me! Help!
That dude is dead.
You're dead, Willie.
No! No! No!
Help me!
Tell the driver to hurry.
Yo, man, you wanna step on it, please?
Listen, lady, I'm driving as fast as I can.
Problems?
- Carl, is that you?
- No, iùs me, Oda Mae.
Listen. Molly,
I know what you think of me.
I know what you think of me, but, look, you gotta talk to me.
You are in serious danger.
I got Sam here with me.
- We got to come in and talk to you.
- Get the hell out of here.
- I'm calling the police.
- Good.
- Tell her to do it.
- Fine. Thaùs what we want you to do.
We want you to call the police.
- But you've gotta let us in.
- No.
Look, don't you get it?
Sam was not just accidentally killed.
He was murdered.
He found out that Carl was laundering money at the bank.
Now, this guy Carl is dangerous.
I'm telling you, he tried to kill me.
He's gonna try to kill you, too.
You are in deep, deep trouble.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't. I just... I just can't.
Oda Mae, Oda Mae, tell her she's wearing the shirt that I spilled the margarita on and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.
Molly, Sam says to tell you you're wearing the shirt that he spilled the margarita on and the earrings he gave you for Christmas.
Don't you see?
I'm not a fake, not about this.
- Give me a penny, quick.
- What?
Push a penny under the door, now.
What you be talking about, push a penny under the door?
Just do it.
- Tell her iùs for luck.
- Sam says iùs for luck.
We're between Greene and Mercer on Prince.
We're between Greene and Mercer on Prince.
Iùs the gray building right across from the post office.
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry.
We'll be waiting.
- All right. They're on their way.
- Good.
- So, what do we do now?
- Just wait.
Is Sam here?
Sam?
I'm sitting beside her.
He's sitting right beside you.
Sam, can you feel me?
With all my heart.
He says with all his heart.
I'd give anything if I could just touch you once more.
He says he wishes he was alive again, so he could touch you.
Me, too.
Okay. Okay, look. You can use me.
- Use you?
- You can use my body.
Use your body?
Just do it quick before I change my mind.
Molly?
Molly, are you home?
Iùs Carl.
Molly!
Fire escape.
Whaùs happening to me?
Molly?
Molly?
Molly!
Son of a bitch.
Come on.
Molly, look. Look.
Oh, leùs go. Leùs go.
Molly!
Just get away from us, Carl.
- Molly!
- You're just a liar. Liar!
Molly, you got to listen to me.
This woman's a thief.
- She's a con artist.
- Why?
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't listen to her, Molly.
Stop!
Just get away from us, Carl.
I've called the police.
Molly!
Shit.
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- Don't interfere, Molly. She's a thief.
All right, the check.
Just give me the check.
- Carl, no.
- Stay out of this, Molly!
Son of a bitch!
Keep out of this, Molly!
Get off of me!
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it, God damn it!
- I gave it away.
- You're lying to me.
Don't lie to me, God damn it!
The check.
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to God, I'll kill her.
Just... Look, just give me the check,
Sam. Okay?
I promise you I'll let her go if you'll just give it to me.
Okay?
Sam?
Sam?
Sam.
- Oh, Carl.
- What?
No!
Are you two all right?
Sam?
Molly?
I can hear you.
Oh, God.
Sam? They're waiting for you, Sam.
I'll miss you.
Your mother'd be proud.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Sam.
You're all right.
Bye, Oda Mae.
Bye, Sam.
I love you, Molly.
I've always loved you.
Ditto.
Iùs amazing, Molly.
The love inside, you take it with you.
See you.
See you.
Bye.
- Hello?
- Hello.
- Yes?
- Who is this?
- Who're you trying to reach?
- What number is this?
- Well, what number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.
- Well, I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?
It happens. Take it easy.
- Hello.
- I'm sorry. I guess I dialled the wrong number.
- So why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.
- You're forgiven. Bye now.
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.
They've got 900 numbers for that.
See ya.
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.
- I don't think so.
- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.
- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.
- I only eat popcorn at the movies.
- Well, I'm getting ready to watch a video.
- Really? What?
- Oh, just some scary movie.
- Do you like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.
- What's your favourite scary movie?
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favourite.
What comes to mind?
Um, "Halloween. "
You know, the one with the guy in the white mask who walks around and stalks baby-sitters.
- Yeah.
- What's yours?
- Guess.
- Um, "Nightmare on Elm Street".
- Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
Freddy, that's right.
I liked that movie. It was scary.
Yeah, the first one was, but the rest sucked.
So, you got a boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out on a date?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.
- You never told me your name.
- Why do you want to know my name?
- 'Cause I want to know who I'm looking at.
What did you say?
I want to know who I'm talking to.
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?
What?
Hello?
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.
Uh, nah, I don't think so.
Don't hang up on me!
Shit. Yes?
I told you not to hang up on me.
- What do you want?
- To talk.
Well, dial someone else, okay?
- Listen, asshole-
- No, you listen, you little bitch.
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?
- Yeah.
- Is this some kind of joke?
More of a game, really.
Can you handle that, blondie?
Can you see me?
Listen. I am two seconds away from calling the police.
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.
Who's there?
Who's there?
I'm calling the police.
You should never say "Who's there?"
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.
You might as well just come out here to investigate a strange noise or something.
Look, you've had your fun now, so
I think you better just leave or else.
Or else what?
Or else my boyfriend'll be here any second and he'll be pissed when he finds out.
- I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
- I lied! I do have a boyfriend... and he'll be here any second, so your ass better be gone.
- Sure.
- I swear.
He's big and he plays football, and he'll kick the shit out of you!
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.
So you better just leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
How do you know his name?
Turn on the patio lights... again.
Oh, God!
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Where are you? Where are you?
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?
- I wanna play a game.
- No.
- Then he dies right now.
- No! No! No!
Which is it?
Which is it?
Well, what kind of a game?
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.
Just do it!
No, Casey! No! No!
No, Casey!
Here's how we play.
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.
- Please don't do this.
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- Please-
- It's an easy category.
- Please.
- Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.
- Name the killer in "Halloween. "
- No.
Come on! It's your favourite scary movie, remember?
- He had a white mask.
He stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.
- What's his name?
- I- I can't think.
Steve's counting on you.
Michael-
Michael Meyers.
Yes! Very good.
Now for the real question.
- No!
- But you're doing so well.
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question.
Same category.
Oh, please stop.
Name the killer in
"Friday the 13th. "
Jason! Jason, Jason!
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.
No, it's not!
No, it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not. No way.
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddam times!
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs Voorhees, was the original killer.
Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.
- You tricked me.
- Lucky for you there's a bonus round.
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!
Hey, we're not finished yet.
Final question.
Are you ready?
Please, please, leave me alone.
Answer the question, and I will.
What door am I at?
- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.
The front door and the patio doors.
If you answer correctly, you live. Very simple.
Don't do this.
I can't. I won't.
Your call.
Did you water over here today?
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.
Mom!
- Jesus!
- What is it?
Casey!
Oh, G-
Casey. Casey. Casey!
- Where is she?
- Call the police!
- Casey! Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?
- Where is she?
- She's- She's here.
- Mom.
- Oh, my God, I, I can hear her.
- Mom.
- Where is she?
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.
Hey!
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.
- It's just me.
- Billy, what the-
What are you doing here?
- Sorry, don't hate me.
- Oh, my God!
- What, do you sleep in that?
Yes, I sleep in this. You gotta go.
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.
- Okay, I'll just stay a sec.
- No- You can't be in here.
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go, go, go.
- What's going on in there? Are you okay?
- Can you knock?
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.
- No?
Oh, well.
I'm hittin' the sack.
My flight leaves first thing in the morning.
Now, the expo runs all weekend, so I won't be back till Sunday.
- There's cash on the table, and I'm staying at-
- The Hilton.
- Out at the airport, so call if-
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.
- Have a good trip, okay?
- Sleep tight, sweetie.
- Oh, close call.
- Billy, what're you doing here?
- Well, it occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.
Great idea. Now that it's out of your system.
You know, I was home watching television. The, uh-
"The Exorcist" was on.
It got me thinking of you.
- It did?
- Yeah, it was edited for TV.
You know, all the good stuff was cut out. And it got me thinking of us... how two years ago we started off hot and heavy.
Nice solid R-rating on our way to an NC-17.
And now things have changed and... lately we're just sort of edited for television.
Oh, so you thought you would climb in my window and we'd have a little raw footage?
No. No, I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule.
I just thought maybe we could do a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- If we ever fly away
Baby, I'm with you
Baby, I'm your man
Hey.
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-bucket.
God, you see what you do to me?
You know what my dad'll do to you?
Yeah. I'm going.
Okay.
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
You know, I- I appreciate the romantic gesture.
So, come on, baby
Hey, about the, uh- the sex stuff...
I- I'm not trying to rush you at all.
- I was only half serious.
- Okay.
Baby, I'm your man
Baby, I'm your man
Hey, Billy.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
What's that?
My God.
You're just a tease.
Thirty-five-
Situation under control.
Roger, dispatch.
There's blood found?
All right.
They are doing drugs that they buy in the classrooms... and that they are involved in the occult.
Occult?
Woodsboro, California, was devastated last night when two young teenagers were found brutally murdered.
Authorities have yet to issue a statement, but our sources tell us... that no arrest has been made and the murderer could strike again.
- Do you believe this shit?
- Damn! What is going on?
- You don't know?
- No.
- Casey Becker and Steve Orth were killed last night.
- What? No way.
And we're not just talking killed.
We're talking splatter-movie killed.
Ripped open from end to end.
- Casey Becker, she sits next to me in English.
- Not any more. It's so sad.
Her mom and dad, they found her hanging from a tree, her insides on the outside.
Oh, my God!
Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless. I mean, they're interrogating the entire school.
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?
They don't know. I mean,
Dewey was saying this is the worst crime they've seen in years.
Even worse than-
Well, it's bad.
- Here you go, Mrs Tate.
- Thank you, James.
Sidney. It would appear to be your turn.
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.
- Prescott.
She was daughter of, uh-
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.
- Hi, Sidney.
- Sheriff Burke, Dewey.
Uh, that's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
- How is everything?
- Good.
And your dad?
How's he doin'?
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this very brief, Sidney.
- The police just want to ask you a few questions. You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Sidney, were you very close to Casey Becker?
Remember, your principal loves you, and I want you to be safe.
All students are encouraged to return to their homes promptly from school grounds. Avoid strangers.
- Walk in twos and threes.
Counsellors will be here tomorrow.
- What kind of questions did they ask you, Sidney?
- Thank you.
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- Yeah, they asked me that too.
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.
- Did they ask you?
- Hunt? Why would they ask you if you like to hunt?
'Cause their bodies were gutted.
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.
- It's 'cause there's no way a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct. "
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out.
And the fact is, it takes a man to do something like that.
- Or a man's mentality.
- How do you gut someone?
You take a knife, and you slit 'em from the groin to sternum.
Hey, it's called tact, you fuck rag.
Hey, Stu, didn't you used to date Casey?
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she dumped you for Steve.
- I thought you dumped her for me.
- I did. He's full of shit.
And are the police aware that you dated the victim?
Hey, what're you saying?
That- That- That I killed her?
- It would certainly improve your high school "Q."
- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.
- Was that before or after he sliced and diced?
- Fuck you, nut case.
Where were you last night?
- Working, thank you.
- Oh, at the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.
- Twice.
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.
Thanks, buddy. Besides, it takes a man to do something like that.
- I'm gonna gut your ass in a second, kid.
- Tell me something. Did you really put her liver in the mailbox?
'Cause I heard that they found her liver in the mailbox next to her spleen and her pancreas.
Randy, you goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here. Okay?
She's getting mad, all right?
You better "liver" alone.
"Liver" alone!
"Liv-" Ow! "Liver. Liver. Liv-"
It was a joke.
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.
So, you sure I can stay over, 'cause my dad won't be back till Sunday.
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practise.
You okay?
Uh-huh. It's just, you know, the police and reporters... and everything, it's like deja vu all over again.
I'll be there by 7:00,
I promise.
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.
The bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker and her 18-year-old boyfriend
Steven Orth... were discovered late last night by the girl's parents-
The Woodsboro double murder case.
Authorities are baffled by the lack of clues and the savage-
The town's in shock, and no one can quite believe what has happened here... although this is not the first time this small community... of Woodsboro has endured such tragedy.
Only a year ago Maureen Prescott, wife and mother... was found raped and murdered not far from this peaceful town square.
- Hello?
- Practise ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?
- It's past 7:00.
- Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it till way after 10:00.
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.
I'm gonna swing by the video store.
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
"All The Right Moves. "
You know, if you pause it just right, you can see his penis.
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.
- Tatum, just get in the car-
- Hello, Sidney.
Uh, hi, who is this?
You tell me.
- Well, I-I have no idea.
- Scary night, isn't it?
With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Randy, you gave yourself away.
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies,
Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favourite scary movie?
- Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.
- Why not? Too scared?
No, no. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.
Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can't act... who's always running up the stairs when she should be going out the front door.
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.
- So, who are you?
- The question isn't "Who am I?"
The question is
"Where am I?"
S- S-So, where are you?
Your front porch.
Why would you be calling from my front porch?
That's the original part.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I call your bluff.
- So, where are you?
- Right here.
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. Okay.
What am I doin'? Huh?
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!
Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye now.
If you hang up on me, you'll die just like your mother!
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.
Fuck you, you cretin!
No!
Shit!
- Billy!
- The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?
The killer's here. He's in the house.
No, he's in the house.
He's got a knife.
He's gonna kill us.
He's gone. He's gone.
It's all right.
What?
Sid, what?
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?
Sidney, come back!
Sidney!
Sorry! I found this.
Come on!
- All right, hold your hands together.
- Do you wish to give up your right to remain silent?
- I didn't do anything.
- Do you wish to give up your right to speak to an attorney... and have them present during questioning?
Ask her. She'll tell you.
Ask her.
- What do you got, Dewey?
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait, who is that?
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.
- I didn't do it.
- Let's go.
Sheriff, wait!
Wait, listen. Call my dad.
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.
Sidney! Sidney!
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.
- She'd have to be, all the shit she's been through.
- Sid!
Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and answer a few questions, Sid?
Oh, shit, Sidney! God, Sid, I'm so sorry
I was late. Are you all right?
- Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.
- It's okay.
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.
- Come on, Sid.
- Oh, you won't believe this.
Creepy, huh?
- I'll be damned.
- What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!
My name isn't Jesus.
Sidney, is that you in there? Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?
- None of your damn business.
- I heard something about a costume. Is that true?
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.
Leave Sid alone.
Where's she goin'?
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?
I know that you're about 50 pounds overweight, but when I say "hurry"... please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"
- Did you find him?
- Are you sure it was the Hilton?
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.
Could he have stayed somewhere else?
I don't know. I guess.
- Don't worry, Sid. We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.
Hold on a minute.
Let me ask you this. What're you doin' with a cellular telephone, son?
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.
- I didn't make those calls, I swear.
- Why don't you check the phone bill, for Christ's sake!
- Call Vital Phone Comp. They got the records of every number dialled.
- Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.
- What were you doing over at Sidney's house tonight?
- I wanted to see her, that's all.
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too.
You went out last night?
I was watchin' TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?
No. No, I didn't.
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody!
We're gonna have to hold you, son, till we get those phone records.
This is crazy.
You know that?
I didn't do it.
- Camera Two?
- Go. I do.
- Okay.
Are there any more doughnuts in there?
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.
- Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live from Woodsboro police station...
- Hey, where's she going?
- where we hope to get a glimpse of Sidney Prescott.
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you know who you're dealing with?
- No cameras, please.
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- All right, come on.
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.
Come on!
Sid, we're gonna get you out of here, okay? Are you okay?
They sell this costume at every five-and-dime in the state.
There's no way to track the purchase.
- What about that cellular phone bill?
- Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything until the morning.
Oh, come on!
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance. "
But these kids today, damned if I know.
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.
Goddamn it, Dewey!
What did Mama tell you?
When I wear this badge, you treat me like a man of the law!
- I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy, but we're ready to go. Now, okay?
- Whoa.
Uh, take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!
- He's my superior.
- The janitor is your superior.
Let's get back to work!
- Isn't there a back way out of this building?
- Yeah. Down that alley, I think.
You guys just stay here. I'm gonna get the car. Don't move. Don't make a sound.
There she is. Sidney!
Hi. That was some night.
What happened? Are you all right?
- She's not answering any questions, all right? Just leave us alone.
- No. No. Tatum. It's okay.
- She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?
- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?
- Well, it'll be out later this year.
Oh, I'll look for it.
I'll send you a copy.
- Jeez. Nice shot.
- Bitch!
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?
God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy. "
Bam! Bitch went down.
"I'll send you a copy. " Bam!
Sid- Superbitch! You are so cool.
Thought you might want some ice for that right hook.
Thanks.
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you really think
Billy did it?
He was there, Tatum.
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.
- My dad?
- I don't think so.
- Take a message.
- No, um, I'll get it.
How's she doin'?
- Hello.
- Hello, Sidney.
- No!
- Poor Billy-boyfriend.
- An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
- Leave me alone!
- Looks like you fingered the wrong guy again.
- Dewey!
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.
- Don't worry.
- You'll find out soon enough. I promise.
- Dewey!
What?
- What?
- What?
Hello.
Sidney Prescott, who escaped a vicious attack last night... is the daughter of Maureen Prescott who was brutally killed last year... when convicted murderer Cotton Weary broke into their home... and savagely raped and tortured the deceased.
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence... handed down after the young Sidney testified against him.
She was the key witness in the State's case against the-
It's never gonna stop, is it?
Billy was released.
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.
We're checkin' every cellular account in the county.
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced.
It's gonna take some time, but we'll find him.
You okay?
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.
- So how does it feel to be almost brutally butchered?
- Hey! Hey, now leave her alone.
- Come on, Sid.
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?
- She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.
What?
Just a sec.
- Stop right there.
- I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
- Right. And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
- What is your problem?
You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary's in jail. They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.
It doesn't really matter what I think.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I think you falsely identified him, yes.
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.
He admits to having sex with your mother, but that's all.
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.
He raped her, and then he- he butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
He was drunk that night.
He left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him.
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave wearing that coat.
The same someone who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him.
No. Cotton murdered my mother.
You're not so sure any more, are you?
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.
- The killer's still on the loose, isn't he?
- Come on, Sid.
- Those murders are related.
- I'm sorry I mangled your face.
- Wait, Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?
Jesus Christ!
An innocent man on death row.
- A killer still on the loose.
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?
No, no, no. Not so fast.
We don't have anything concrete.
- This is huge. You can't just sit on it.
- I know! That's why we need proof.
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.
Do you know what that could do for my book sales?
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.
I want you to meet me right here after class, okay, Sid?
All right.
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?
Oh, you mean after you branded him the Candyman?
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!
Why are they doing this?
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.
Sidney!
- Ow!
- Jesus! Shit!
It's just me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.
No. No, I-I don't.
- It's just somebody was there.
- Hey, Christy, wait up!
- Billy, someone- someone tried to kill me.
- I know. I know. I know.
The cops said I scared him away.
It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called me again last night at Tatum's house.
You see? It couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?
I'm so sorry.
Please understand.
Understand what? That I have a girlfriend who would rather accuse me... of being a psychopathic killer than touch me?
- You know that's not true.
- Then what is it?
What is it? Billy, I was attacked and nearly filleted last night!
I mean between us.
You haven't been the same since-
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?
My mom was killed. I can't believe you're bringing this up!
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.
I know. I think it's time you got over that. I mean, when my mom left my dad, I accepted it.
It's the way it is.
She's not comin' back.
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's- It's a bad analogy.
But it's just that...
I want my girlfriend back.
- Sid!
- Billy, I am sorry if my traumatized life... is an inconvenience to you and your perfect existence.
What? What are you-
Nobody said that. Sid!
- Stupid.
- You make me so sick!
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me!
So, two of your fellow students just savagely murdered... and this is the way that you show your compassion and sensitivity, huh?
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!
Oh, come on, Mr Himbry!
It was just a joke.
Yeah, that's not fair!
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.
Fairness would be to rip your insides out, hang you from a tree... so we can expose you for the heartless, desensitized little shits that you are.
- She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.
- Why would she lie about it?
For attention!
The girl has some serious issues.
What if she did it? What if
Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
And why would she do that?
Maybe she had the hots for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend, Billy.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mother.
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.
Her mother's death leaves her disturbed and hostile.
In a cruel and inhumane world, she's delusional.
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself... but she realizes that teen suicide is out this year... and homicide is a much healthier, therapeutic expression.
- Where do you get this shit?
- "Ricki Lake. "
You are pathetic.
Pathetic.
Sidney.
Sidney.
Is someone there?
In what appears to be a prank, several students were seen wearing scary masks.
School officials have yet to comment... but this is known to be the same costume worn by the killer.
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker and her boyfriend Steven Orth have already lost their lives.
Who's next? You can literally feel the fear on this campus.
Hi. Gale Weathers, field correspondent, "Top Story. "
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?
No, everything's under control.
- Well, of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.
I know. I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker, but who knew?
- You look awfully young to be a police officer.
- I'm 25 years old.
You know, in a demographic study
I proved to be most popular amongst males 11 to 24.
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.
Except in that upper torso area.
Does the force require you to work out?
No, ma'am.
Because of my boyish good looks... muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer.
I need your attention now, kids. Due to the recent events that have occurred... effective immediately, all classes are suspended until further notice.
The Woodsboro police department has issued a citywide curfew... beginning at 9:00 tonight.
Looks like we've got a serial killer on our hands.
Well, serial killer's not really accurate.
Gotta knock off a couple more to get that title.
Well, we can hope, can't we?
I mean, we certainly don't have any leads.
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.
- Well, he's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out as a possibility.
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers... you are much prettier in person.
So you do watch the show.
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.
Please, call me Gale!
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh, Sidney.
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.
Well, you're not to be alone any more.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out. "
I don't know what you did, Sidney, but on behalf of the entire student body, we all say, "Thank you!"
- Drop it, Stu.
- No, I say... an impromptu party tonight, my house.
- Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?
- Are you serious?
As long as this little vixen doesn't invite the entire world, we'll be fine.
Intimate gathering, intimate friends.
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks?
I will totally protect you. Yo,
I am so buff. I got you covered, girl.
- No.
- Come on, Sid. For me?
It could be fun.
- Okay. Whatever.
- Yeah? Nice.
Cool. You guys bring food, all right?
Yes?
Hello?
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.
School's out for summer
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary is telling the truth?
- With fever
- Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
- I mean, your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe-
- School's out
- Completely
- Maybe your mom was just a very unhappy woman.
If- If they were having an affair, then how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Well, you can't prove a rumour.
That's why it's a rumour.
Right. Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
It goes further back, Sid.
There's been talk about other men.
And you believe it.
Well, I mean, you can only hear that Richard Gere gerbil story so many times... before you have to start believing it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, if-if I was wrong about Cotton Weary, then the killer's still out there.
Don't go there, Sid.
You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick or something.
Don't freak yourself out, okay? We've got a long night ahead of us. Okay?
Let's boogie.
- It's alive!
- Henry!
Oh, in the name of God, now I know-
Excuse me, dude.
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.
Dork.
Jesus, this place is packed tonight, man.
- We had a run in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know.
- Cool.
What's that werewolf movie with E.T.'s mom in it?
- "The Howling. " Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath... would you be standing in the horror section?
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.
You're such a little lapdog. He's got
"killer" printed all over his forehead.
Okay! Really? Well, why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?
Because obviously they don't watch enough movies.
This is standard horror movie stuff.
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna kill his own girlfriend?
There's always some stupid, bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all: simplicity.
Besides, if it gets too complicated, you lose your target audience.
Well, what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
- What, is she savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her, do you think Sid would go out with me?
No, I don't at all. No.
You know who I think it is?
You know, I think it's her father.
Why can't they find her pops, man?
Because he's probably dead.
His body will come poppin' up in the last reel somewhere!
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off, teeth knocked out!
- See, the police are always off track with this shit.
- Man!
If they'd watch "Prom Night," they'd save time.
There's a formula to it. A very simple formula! Everybody's a suspect!
I'm telling you, the dad's a red herring. It's Billy.
How do we know you're not the killer? Huh? Huh?
- Hi, Billy.
- Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its reality button. You ever think of that?
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.
And what would be your motive?
It's the millennium.
Motives are incidental.
"Millennium. "
"Millennium. " I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.
Good kid.
"Millennium. "
Good word, my man.
Are you telling me that's not a killer?
You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere
But he ain't
What he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
Hey, buddy
I'm warnin' you to turn it off
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god
He's a man
He's a guru
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand
Sure is quiet.
God, look at this place.
It's "The Town That Dreaded Sundown. "
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?
Hey, Sid, just think. If they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.
You girls don't go too far.
- Is Billy gonna be there tonight?
- He better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.
I think we can live without the endorphin rush for one night.
Billy's right, you know. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
So you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death.
It's no big deal, Sid.
I mean, you'll thaw out.
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me, you know, with all the sex stuff.
How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you, all right?
- Dewey, where the hell you been?
- I was keepin' an eye on Sidney, uh-
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it-
Dewey, Vital Phone just faxed us.
Those calls are listed to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.
There's no way a cellular could've been cloned?
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.
The anniversary of his wife's death.
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew in effect through the night.
If he's not picked up by morning, then we'll do a house-to-house.
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?
No. Not just yet.
Let's find Neil first, make sure he's our man.
You stay close to Sidney.
Don't let her out of your sight.
Yes, sir.
Say a prayer for the youth of America
God bless the youth of America
And I can't stand their sight any more
All right, you girls have fun.
Not too much fun, or I'll bust ya.
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.
You're obsessed
You're obsessed
Here, kids!
- Oh, that's mature.
- You guys were tardy for the party, so we started without you.
My man!
- Well, were we spotted?
- I don't think so. Go get the camera.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare ya.
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?
Well, you just never know when or where a story will break.
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.
Then what are you doing here?
Just keepin' an eye on things.
I'm gonna check the party out.
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.
All right.
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh! Yeah.
- How many "Evil Deads?"
- One!
- Two!
- How many "Hellraisers?"
- Hellraiser right here.
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night. "
How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all of these movies?
She's the scream queen.
- With a set of lungs like that, she should be.
- Yeah.
- Tits. See?
- Oh, I'll get it.
- Hey, Tate, grab me another beer, would ya?
- There's more beer in the garage.
- What am I, the beer wench?
- She was nominated-
- She was nominated for "Terror Train. "
- You're not gonna believe who's here!
- It's that chick from "Top Story!"
- Gale Weathers?
- Here!
- Shit!
- You're under age, son.
I'm kiddin'. Have a good time.
Watch the drivin'.
- Dewey.
- Hi.
Dewey.
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me.
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.
Now leave, and take your media mouth with you.
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I need a camera.
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one I want.
Too bad, I've spoken
When I look at you you're forgiven
You're forgiven
Jesus!
Tatum, it's okay.
Shit.
Hey, shitheads!
Hello!
Shit. Piss.
Is that you, Randy?
Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage?"
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?
Can I be the helpless victim?
Okay, let's see- No, please don't kill me, Mr Ghost Face.
I wanna be in the sequel!
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.
Randy, what the hell are you doing?
Stop!
Fucker!
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here but us chickens!
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.
Oh. Billy. Hey.
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?
I was hoping I could talk to Sid alone.
You know, if Tatum sees you here, she'll draw blood.
I tell you what. Why don't you guys go up to my parents' room?
You know, you guys can talk, whatever.
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.
- What's Leatherface doin' here?
- Cute. He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.
As if.
That's all I'm sayin'.
As if.
Oh, really, Alicia?
"As if. "
I'm gonna go check on them.
- Come on!
- Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.
- Thank you.
- Stick around.
You're a genius.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?
I don't know. What'd it take you to walk from the house, 30 seconds?
- It'll be fine. Just record it.
- All right.
Oh, the placement is perfect.
Tell me, Kenneth-
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist ever won the Pulitzer?
- Well, first time for everything.
- You're damn right.
S- So, um-
So-
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been selfish, and I want to apologize.
No, Billy, I-I'm... the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed... with all this post-traumatic stress.
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.
Enough is enough.
I-
I can't wallow in-in the grief process forever... and- and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Yeah, I think I'm really... scared... that I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know?
Like "The Bad Seed" or somethin'.
And I know-
I know it doesn't make sense.
Yeah, it does.
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"... when she keeps having flashbacks of her dead father.
But this is life.
This isn't a movie.
Sure it is, Sid.
It's all-
It's all a movie.
It's all... one great big movie.
Only you can't pick your genre.
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?
Or even a good porno.
- What?
- You heard me.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I think so.
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.
Oh, man.
The colour of the blood is all wrong!
Why do they do that?
It's too red!
Wait. Here comes another.
Here it- Here it-
- Ooh!
- Yes! Yes!
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.
How can you watch this shit over and over?
When do we see breasts?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Yes. Yes.
- Breasts?
Not until "Trading Places" in '83.
Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.
She never showed her tits till she went legits.
- Could afford a decent pair.
- What did you-
That's why she always outsmarted the killer in the big chase scene at the end.
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?
- You don-
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?
Have an aneurysm, why don't ya?
There are certain rules that one must abide by... in order to successfully survive a horror movie.
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.
- Big no-no! Big no-no!
- I'd be a dead man.
- Sex equals death. Okay?
- Yes!
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.
No, the sin factor.
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.
And number three:
Never, ever, ever... under any circumstances say,
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.
I'll be right back!
You see? You push the laws and you end up dead.
Okay? I'll see you in the kitchen with a knife.
Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene at the end.
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?
You don't know the rules?
There are certain rules...
- that one must abide by in order to essentially survive a horror movie.
- Boring.
- For instance-
- The sheriff just radioed.
Somebody reported a car in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.
If you're sure it's all right.
Ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.
Be right back.
You see, you push the laws and you end up dead.
- W- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?
I thought maybe we'd walk.
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.
- You're not scared, are ya?
- No.
- All right.
- Great.
Do you know what that constellation is?
No. What is it?
I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.
- What happened to Tatum, Stu?
- She probably got pissed at me and bailed.
- Bye.
- Bye.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
Look! Here comes the obligatory tit shot!
- Yes! Oh! That was beautiful!
- Lovely!
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.
You are so... amazing.
Hello? Yeah?
Holy shit.
N- Ho-
Listen up.
They found
Principal Himbry dead.
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!
- Where did he say he was?
- Where are you guys-
Where are you guys-
- At the football field!
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?
We were just gettin' to the good part.
Hello? Yeah?
Where are you guys-
Heigh-ho, Silver!
Let's go!
- So, is- is Dewey your real name?
- No, it's Dwight.
Dwight?
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.
Well, I like it.
It's sexy.
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.
Ah, it's just this town's way of not takin' me serious.
What about Gale Weathers?
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist or something.
People treat me like I'm the antichrist of television journalism.
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?
- No.
I think that's just 'cause you kinda like me.
They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!
Freeze! Jump!
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm on duty.
Is that what you're looking for?
My whole life.
- Damn!
- What?
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.
Jesus.
What's he doing here?
We gotta get back.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Who'd you call?
- What?
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested you're allowed one phone call.
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?
Called my dad.
No, um, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.
You don't still think it was me, do you?
No.
No. I was just thinking... if it were you it'd be a very clever way to throw me off track.
You know, using your one phone call to call me so that I wouldn't think it was you, that's all.
Really.
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney-
- Billy, watch out!
Sid.
Shit!
Help me, somebody!
Help me!
Help me!
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.
You- You know-
Look-
Look, there he is.
I told you.
I told you he was right around the corner.
Jamie. Jamie.
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.
Turn around.
Behind you.
All the time!
Behind you!
Behind you, Jamie.
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.
Help me! Help!
Let me in!
- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.
- Jamie. Jamie.
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!
- Behind ya!
- Look around!
- Shit.
- What?
- We're on 30-second delay.
Oh, my God.
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.
Be careful!
Neil?
Mr Prescott?
Shit!
Kenny, I need the cellular!
Kenny!
Kenny!
- What's going on?
Oh, God!
Stop!
Oh, God!
Dewey!
Dewey, where are you?
Dewey!
Sidney?
Dewey!
Shit!
7825, suspect at
105 North Avenue 52.
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's gonna try and kill me.
Sidney!
Sidney!
Jesus, we've got to get the fuck out of here!
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!
- Stay back!
- Stu did it. He killed Billy!
He killed my Tatum!
- You did it!
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!
Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!
Give me that gun! Christ, man!
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!
- Open up!
- He did it!
Help me!
He's going crazy!
- Sidney!
- Go away!
Sidney?
Leave me alone.
- Sid.
- Billy.
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.
No, I'm like a stuck pig, but I'm all right.
- Get up.
- Help me.
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.
- No, he's out there.
No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Careful.
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho. "
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for pig's blood in "Carrie. "
Stu.
Help me, please.
Surprise, Sidney.
- No!
- Ooh!
Oh, now. Whoa.
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Why are you doing this?
- It's all part of the game, Sidney.
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die. "
- Fuck you!
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.
See, we ask you a question, and if you get it wrong...
"boo-kah," you die!
You get it right, you die.
- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer the term "psychotic. "
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?
Tell that to Cotton Weary.
You wouldn't believe how easy he was to frame.
Watch a few movies, take a few notes.
- It was fun.
- No!
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?
Why? Why did you kill my mother?
Why? Why?
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.
Well, I don't really believe in motive, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.
- Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?
Don't think so! See, it's a lot scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slut-bag whore... who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney... your mother was no Sharon Stone, hmm?
Is that motive enough for you?
Well, how about this?
Your slut mother was fucking my father... and she's the reason my mom moved out and abandoned me.
How's that for a motive?
Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behaviour.
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin.
I said "virgin. "
Whoops!
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.
Let's pretend it's all a scary movie,
Sid. How do you think it's gonna end?
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!
Hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.
You know what time it is, Sid?
It's after midnight.
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.
We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Attention! Oh, what do we have behind door number three, Sidney?
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it. That's enough.
Guess we won't be needing this any more, huh?
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.
- Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?
- Come on, Sidney.
You think about it now, huh?
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?
Your mother's anniversary set him off, and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone.
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.
Then he kills you... and shoots himself in the head.
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.
Watch this.
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!
Good one, man. Jesus.
Oh, shit.
My turn.
Don't forget. Stay to the side and don't go too deep.
Okay. I'll remember.
Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!
Goddamn it, Stu!
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?
- Give me the knife.
- No.
Give me the knife!
Now!
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.
We get to carry on and plan the sequel...
'cause let's face it, baby, these days ya gotta have a sequel!
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.
Now, Sid, don't you blame the movies.
Movies don't create psychos.
I feel a little woozy here!
All right.
All right, you get the gun.
And I'll untie Pops, okay?
- Now!
- Okay.
Houston, we- we have a problem here.
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.
I put it right there, and it's not there.
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.
The reporter left for dead in the news van... comes to... stumbles on you two dipshits, finds the gun... foils your plan and saves the day.
I like that ending.
I know something you don't.
Fuck. No!
Yeah, man.
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.
It works better without the safety on.
This is Gale Weathers signing off.
Babe, you're gonna love this!
Shit.
What?
Where are they?
Where are they?
I don't know, Billy, but I'm hurtin', man.
Fuck!
Shall I let the machine get it?
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.
It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass. "
- Find her, you dipshit! Get up!
- I can't, Billy.
You already cut me too deep.
I think I'm dying here, man.
Talk to her.
Talk to her.
- Hello?
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive?
Billy's got one.
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch, just like your fucking mother!
- You've gotta find me first, you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!
Ow. You fuckin' hit me with the phone, dick!
Fucker, where are you?
You fuck!
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me.
Bitch!
My arm!
I always had a thing for ya, Sid!
Bitch.
- I'm sorry. It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Randy.
I thought you were dead.
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.
Fucker!
Say hello to your mother.
It's okay.
Guess I remembered the safety that time, you bastard.
Careful. This is the moment... when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life for one last scare.
Not in my movie.
Dad.
Randy, help me out.
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.
Okay, I think it's going to go something like this. Just stay with me.
Hi, this is Gale Weathers with an exclusive eyewitness account... of this amazing breaking story.
Several more local teens are dead... bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the mass killing... that has terrified this peaceful community... like the plot of some scary movie.
It all began with a scream over 9-1-1... and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro... all played out here in this peaceful farmhouse... far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities... that its residents had fled.
Okay, let's take it back to one.
Come on. Move it.
This is my big shot.
Let's go.
Love comes down upon us and it flows like water
Burning with the hope of insight
There the books, the colours of a bright elation
Stolen in the sight of love
We are, we are, we are
We're just children
Fighting our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream
Birds fly in the eye of the faithless daughters
Spoken at the bitter end
Wasted, sacrificed for the new nirvana
Nighttime sends us on our way
We are, we are, we are
We're just children
Fighting our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
Whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
We are, we are, we are
We're just children
Fighting our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- A whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream
Whisper to a scream
Look outside of my window
But all I see is the rain come down
A pink umbrella and a bit of her lace
Is all I need and I'll come, come
I don't care if you don't care
The world looks just fine to me
Don't be shy and I'll show you, baby
What's it like to be free
I don't care if you don't care
The world looks just fine to me
Don't be shy and I'll show you, baby
What it's like to be free
I
I don't care if you don't care
The world looks just fine to me
Don't be shy and I'll show you, baby
What it's like to be free
- Don't be shy
- Told you, baby
Don't be shy
Come on, Anne.
Get in.
Are you able to talk?
During the...
Were you conscious?
I'm sorry to have to inform you...
Do you know?
Your husband died in the accident.
No, but you weren't conscious all that time.
Anne?
Yes, your daughter too.
Is someone there? Who did it?
Mr. Leroy?
Please call the guards.
Somebody broke a window on the first floor.
Come straight away.
I'll look in the garden.
I can't do that.
I broke the window.
- Don't worry.
- I'm sorry.
We'll replace it.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
Is it today?
This afternoon. At 17.00.
Can I do anything for you?
Goodbye.
We gathered to pay respects...
to the memory of the man...
and composer, known as one of...
the most outstanding in the world.
Nobody...
can accept...
that he is gone.
We also mourn his 5 year-old daughter...
Who died by his side.
Patrice...
millions of men...
and women awaited the music you composed...
for the Unification of Europe,
which we all hope to celebrate soon.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- I know you don't want to see me.
- Right.
- Can I come in?
- No.
Julie, I don't want an interview.
What then?
I'm writing an article about your husband.
- I need to know something.
- About what?
The concert for the Unification of Europe.
It doesn't exist.
You've changed.
- You were not so rude before.
- Haven't you heard?
I lost my daughter and husband in an accident.
Is it true you wrote your husband's music?
- Good morning.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bernard!
Good morning madam.
- Did you do what I asked?
- Yes.
- Did you clear the blue room?
- Everything.
Madam, we're all deeply sorry.
Marie?
Marie?
Why are you crying?
Because you're not.
I keep thinking about them.
I remember everything.
How can I forget?
Good morning, please come in.
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thanks.
Let's sit down.
This could take a while.
I'll be right back.
Nobody must know about it.
Ever.
You will pay for my mother's rest home for the rest of her life.
You will take care of
Marie and the gardener.
You will sell all our property... and pay all the money in one account.
- Yes.
May I ask why?
No.
Would you excuse me.
- But what will you have left?
- My own account.
I haven't started yet.
- I put it aside...
- The day I left?
Yes.
Here it is. I was waiting to hear from you.
You were right.
A lot of corrections.
No more than usual.
It's beautiful.
I love this chorus.
Yes.
- Hello?
- It's Julie.
Do you love me?
- Yes.
- Since when
Since I started working with
Patrice.
Do you think of me? Do you miss me?
Yes.
Come if you want to.
- Now?
- Yes, now. Right away.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Olivier?
- I fell.
- Please take it off.
The rest too.
They took everything.
Only the matress is left.
I appreciate what you did for me.
But you see I'm like others.
I sweat, cough, I have cavities...
You won't miss me....
You understand that now.
Shut the door when you leave.
Julie!
Julie!
I don't want any children in the building.
Let me ask you something.
It may help.
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
I mean, for a living?
Nothing.
- Absolutely nothing?
- Absolutely nothing.
I have what you are looking for.
But the apartment needs repairing.
It may take a while.
Can I live there now?
Sure. It needs a quick paint.
Can I see it now?
Yes. What is your name?
Julie de Courcy, with a "Y".
Sorry, Julie Vignon. I am going back to my maiden name.
- Coffee and ice cream?
- As usual.
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?
I'm sorry for the noise.
I've almost finished.
I haven't heard anything.
Can I come in?
I heard you got locked out last week.
Your husband lent me a blanket.
I spent the night in the stairwell.
I wanted you to sign this.
- What is it?
- Everyone has signed already.
We don't want loose women in our building.
The young woman downstairs...
I don't want to get involved.
She is a whore.
I don't care.
You are in perfect health.
Everything is fine.
You are in good spirits.
- Yes?
- Hello, it's Antoine.
It is for you.
Hello?
My name is Antoine.
- You don't know me...
- No I don't. Excuse me.
Who is it?
Some boy.
He has been looking for you.
- I said he could call.
- It's alright.
- Hello?
- Let's meet.
- It's important.
- Nothing is important.
- It is about an object.
- What?
A necklace with a cross.
I'd forgotten about it.
I found it near the car.
I couldn't keep it.
That's stealing.
If you want to ask me something,
I got there just after...
No.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to return the necklace...
I wanted to ask you something too.
Yes?
When I opened the door... your husband was still alive.
He said...
I don't understand.
He said "Now try coughing."
He was telling us a joke.
It's about a woman who can't stop coughing. She sees a doctor.
He examined her and gave her a pill.
She swallowed it.
And asked "What was it?"
"The most powerful laxative known to medicine".
"A laxative for a cough?"
"Yes. Try coughing now."
It made us laugh.
Then the car crashed.
My husband always liked to repeat the punch line.
You returned it.
It is yours.
Are you sick?
Are you okay?
You always gotta hold onto something.
What did you say?
- Thank you.
- For what?
I'm staying.
In order to throw me out, they had to collect signatures from all the tenants.
Your place is nice.
When I was a little girl,
I had a lamp like this.
I'd stand under it and stretch out my hand.
I wanted to jump and touch it.
I forgot all about it.
Where did you find it?
I found it.
Souvenir?
Do you live here alone?
Yes.
I could never spend a night alone.
Something must have happened.
You are not the type someone dumps.
Forgive me, I talk too much.
Poor guy.
Who?
He was asleep there last night.
He's gone now but left the flute.
Julie?
A coffee.
I searched everywhere.
- And?
- And I found you.
- Nobody knows where I live.
- Nobody.
It took a few months.
Then I got lucky.
My cleaning lady's daughter saw you in the area.
I've come here ever since.
- Do you spy on me?
- No.
I miss you.
Did you run away?
From me?
Do you hear what he is playing?
- It sounds like...
- Yes.
I've seen you.
Maybe that will do for now.
I'll try.
How do you know this music?
I invent lots of things. I like to play.
Just a second.
- A problem with your place?
- No. I'd like another one like this.
I can manage that but it will take time.
- How long?
- 2 or 3 months.
You cut yourself.
My cat scratched me.
Mum?
Marie-France.
It's me...
Julie.
Julie.
Come to me.
I've heard you are dead.
You seem fine.
Young, very young.
You were always younger, you look 30 now.
- When we were young...
- I'm not your sister, but your daughter.
I'm 33.
I know.
I was kidding.
I have everything here.
The TV...
I see the entire world.
- Do you watch too?
- No.
Tell me about your house, husband... children...
- Or about you?
Mum...
My husband and daughter are dead.
I have no home anymore.
I heard about it.
I was happy before.
I loved them and they loved me.
Mum, are you listening to me?
I'm listening to you, Marie-France.
Now I have only one thing left to do:
Nothing.
I don't want friends, belongings, love any more.
Those are all traps.
Do you have money, my child?
To get by?
- Yes I have enough.
- That's important.
You can't give up everything.
- Mum?
- Yes?
Was I afraid of mice when I was young?
You weren't.
Julie was afraid.
I'm afraid now.
Thank you.
Nice to see you. Come in.
Can I ask you something?
My wife is out. Please come in.
Can you lend me your cat?
Excuse me?
Your cat. I need a cat for a few days.
He's not castrated.
He can be aggressive.
Here.
I am not sure he likes you.
What are you doing here?
I saw you from the bus.
You were running like crazy.
Are you crying?
No, it's water.
- You don't wear underwear?
- Never.
I borrowed the cat from the neighbour, to kill the mice.
It had babies.
It's normal, Julie.
Are you afraid to go back?
I'll go clean up.
I'll see you at my place.
It's Lucille. Julie, I have a favour to ask of you.
Take a taxi here.
I will pay you back.
- Now? It is late.
- It's 11:30pm. You have 25 minutes.
It's important.
- I can't.
- I beg you.
I never asked you for anything. Please come.
- Where?
- 3 Cita de Midi. Near Pigalle.
First door on the left.
There's a buzzer.
Say it's for me. You'll come?
- Yes?
- I've come to see Lucille.
Sorry
You came.
Yes.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
- Are you angry?
- No.
We are on in 5 minutes.
Get me ready.
After I changed,
I came here for a drink.
I looked around at the audience, for no reason.
In the middle...
...of the first row,
I saw my father.
He seemed tired.
And sleepy.
But he was starring a girl's ass.
The shithead who let you in wouldn't make him leave.
He told me if he pays, he has a right to watch.
I didn't know who I could count on.
I was desperate.
I didn't know who to talk to.
- That's why I phoned you.
- And your father?
10 minutes ago, he looked at his watch and left.
The last train to Montpellier is at 11:45pm.
Lucille, why do you do this?
Because I like to.
I think everybody likes to.
- You saved my life.
- I didn't do anything.
I asked you to come and you did.
No.
Julie...
Isn't that you?
Lucille, we are on.
It's me.
The European Council proposes that you...
finish the composition of
Patrice De Courcy.
I agreed. I am working on it now.
I'm trying to understand Patrice.
It's easy.
I don't know.
Can you tell me something...
about this score, shown here for the very first time?
It's the first part of the concert Patrice composed,
commissioned by the European Council.
The concert was to be played just once
by twelve symphonic orchestras...
in the 12 EU cities.
Patrice was a secretive man.
The only person who could understand him.
was his wife, Julie.
I tried asking her...
to participate in this program...
but she refused.
I assume that these documents are from your archives.
No, they are not archives.
Who can predict...?
They are photos and documents which
I found in his desk at the conservatory.
His wife didn't want them.
I am not sure if
I should show them.
He was a great man. One of the most important composers of our time.
That's true
People like him belong to everybody.
I'll be five minutes.
Where did I put it?
A green calling card.
Did you watch TV today?
No.
I found it.
Her number at home and at work.
Why do you need this?
Today, on TV... she showed the scores I took from you.
Yes.
After the accident, when nothing was sure, I made a copy.
When you picked it up,
I knew you'd destroy it.
I kept the copy and sent it to Strasbourg.
Why did you do that?
The music is so beautiful.
You can't destroy things like that.
Olivier!
Olivier!
Olivier!
Olivier!
Olivier!
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
I heard you're finishing Patrice's concert.
I thought I could try...
You can't. You have no right.
It won't be the same.
Do you understand?
I said I'd try.
I don't know if I'll finish.
I'll tell you why. It was a way... that's what I thought... to make you cry, to make you run.
The only way of making you say,
"I want" or "I don't want".
I...
You can't...
It's not fair.
You didn't leave me any choice.
You have no right to.
You want to see what I've done?
I'm not sure I understood.
If I could play for you...
Do you know what the chorus sings?
- No.
- I thought Patrice had told you.
- No.
- In Greek, the rhythm is different.
Who was that girl?
What girl?
In the photos on the program.
She was with Patrice.
Didn't you know?
Just tell me, were they together?
Yes.
Since when?
Several years.
Where does she live?
Near Montparnasse.
They often met at the courts.
She is a lawyer.
Or she works for one.
What do you want to do?
Meet her.
- It's the third time it happened to him.
- It's systematic.
It can't be... it's unbelievable!
But it's not important
What's important is that...
Excuse me.
What about equality?
Is it because I don't speak French... that the court won't hear my case?
- Excuse me...
- Yes?
Yes?
- You were my husband's mistress?
- Yes.
I didn't know. I just found out.
It's a shame.
Now you'll hate him, and me too.
I don't know...
Of course you will.
It is his child?
Yes.
But he didn't know.
I found out...
I found out after the accident.
I didn't want a child but it happened.
Now I want to keep it.
Do you have a cigarette?
You shouldn't.
Do you want to know when and where?
- How many times a month?
- No.
You want to know if he loved me?
Yes, that was my question.
Why ask, I know he loved you.
Yes. He loved me.
Julie...
Will you hate me now?
Come in.
What happened?
You met her?
Once you asked me to take Patrice's papers.
- You didn't want to.
- No, but if I had...
- The photos were among them?
- Yes.
If I had taken them,
I'd have known.
And if I had burned them,
I'd never have known.
That's right.
Maybe it's better this way.
Can you show me what you've composed?
- These are violins?
- The altos.
And now...
Wait a second. Lighter, without the percussions.
Let's remove the trumpets.
Piano. Piano.
Sul tasto.
- Instead of a piano...
- A Flute?
Flute... Start back here.
That's as far as I got.
- And the finale?
- I don't know.
There was a paper.
The counterpoint was supposed to come back.
He told me, it is memento.
Try weaving it back in.
- Van den Budenmayer?
- Yes
He wanted to allude to him at the end. You know how much he loved him.
Are you still in touch with our lawyer?
- Sometimes.
- Did he sell the house yet?
I don't know.
I doubt it. He'd have called.
- Tell him not to.
- Okay.
If you can handle all this, will you show me?
I'll show you.
- There was a mattress inside.
- Yes?
But it's not there any more.
Mr Olivier bought it.
- I didn't think you would need it.
- That's fine.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Have you been here before?
- No, never.
Upstairs are the bedrooms and the office.
I'll show you them later.
This is the kitchen.
It's always been like this.
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Boy.
Have you chosen a name?
Yes.
I thought... he should have his name and his house.
Here.
- Do you still need me?
- No, you can go home. Thank you.
- I knew it.
- What?
Patrice told me a lot about you.
Really?
Like what?
That you are good.
That you are good, and generous.
That's what you want to be.
People can always count on you.
Even me.
I'm sorry.
- Yes?
- It's me. I finished.
Come pick it up tomorrow.
Or now, if you're not too tired.
I'm not tired. But I will not come for the score.
What?
I won't pick it up.
I've been thinking it for a week.
This music can be mine.
A little heavy and awkward...
but mine.
Or yours, but everyone would have to know.
Are you there?
Yes.
You're right.
- Hello?
- It's me again.
I wanted to ask you...
You really sleep on the mattress?
Yes.
- You never told me.
- No I didn't.
Do you still love me?
I love you.
- Are you alone?
- Of course I'm alone.
- I'm coming.
# If I can talk like an angel,
# And I have no love,
# I will be a copper ringing.
# If I can prophesy
# And if I have no love
# I will be nothing.
# Love is patient.
# Love is kind.
# It bears all things.
# And knows everything.
# Love never ends.
# Prophecy - gone.
# If languages - silent.
# Knowledge - nothing.
# Prophecy - gone.
# Languages - silent.
# And only stays
# Faith, hope and love
# But the biggest one from this three
# is love.
I LOVE YOU
4th OF JULY CROAKER FESTIVAL
Let's welcome back our six finalists to the stage.
They're pretty as can be, aren't they?
You worked hard. Your parents worked hard. We're proud of you.
She was born for this.
- Her breasts are so... ample.
- She does exercises to pump 'em up.
Guys, I'm on sexist overload as it is. Kill the commentary.
"In the spirit of Mother Teresa, what will be your contribution -
- to your community and the world at large?"
At summer's end, I plan to become a serious actress in New York City.
By entertaining the world through art, I shall serve my country.
Did you feed her this shit?
Work it. Babe!
They're eating it up.
And this year's Croaker Queen is:
Miss Helen Shivers.
That's my girl!
That's my girlfriend!
- How's my hair?
- Hurricane-proof.
It's all about hair. Don't forget it when you become a big lawyer.
Professional women think it's all about brains, and ignore the "do".
The "do" is vital. Got it.
- Are you riding with me?
- No. Tell Mom I'll be home late.
- Is Miss Croaker gonna get sautéed?
- A twit with a wit.
- Julie. A shooter on the house.
- I can't get past the slime.
How about I take you out before you leave town?
I don't think so. Max.
We've been friends since forever.
You can't leave without a farewell.
A toast... to us.
To our last summer of immature.
Adolescent decadence.
- Somebody's buzzed.
- Chum bait. Take a hike.
- Easy, easy!
- Barry, they're just friends.
Come on. This is tired.
- I'm just taking care of your girl.
- Thanks, buddy. Let's blow.
Let's beam down to Dawson's Beach.
A little joyride.
Bye.
They're making out when they hear over the radio -
- that a killer with a hook for a hand escaped from the insane asylum.
- You're telling it wrong.
- Shut up. The girl gets all scared.
She wants to go home.
The boy gets pissed and peels out.
No, the boy goes for help and the girl stays in the car.
- She hears a scratching sound...
- It's not a scratch, it's a drip.
No, the guy's been hung from a tree.
His feet are scratching the roof.
No, he's been decapitated, and the blood's dripping on the car.
No, he wasn't decapitated, he was gutted with a hook.
- That's the way I heard it.
- You're all wrong.
They get to the girl's house and find a bloody hook in the car door.
That's the original story.
That's the way it really happened.
None of it really happened.
It's a bullshit story.
- No. It's not. It's true.
- I don't think so, Ray.
It's a fictional story to warn girls of the dangers of premarital sex.
You know how terrified I am of your I.Q., but it's an urban legend.
And they all originate from some sort of real-life incident.
By that time I'll be finishing my two-year deal on "Guiding Light", -
- coinciding with your first year as quarterback for the Steelers.
Then we can elope to Europe or the Caymans, -
- where I'll let you impregnate me with the first of three children. - 
- before you head off to rehab.
Then we can live happily... blah. Blah. Blah.
Ray? Where did you go?
I'm gonna hook you!
- Do you really believe that crap?
- It's true.
The hook is really a phallic symbol.
Ultimately castrated.
I'm gonna miss you.
You can always ditch Boston and come to New York with me.
We can't all sit in coffee-houses and ramble on our laptops.
- Nobody gets me the way you do.
- I understand your pain.
I hate this.
You're gonna fall for a head-shaven, body-piercing philosophy student.
- That sounds attractive.
- I'll never see you again.
High-school relationships are more successful than any other kind.
Cite your source.
Are you sure?
- Give me the keys.
- Nobody drives my car but me.
I know, baby, but the Croaker Queen has to get home now.
- Hey, you two.
- Give me my fucking keys.
Come ride in the back with me.
I'll let you do things to me.
- Nobody drives my car but me.
- Get in the car.
You can't drive for shit.
Can you say "alcoholic"?
What the hell is this crap?
What's wrong with you?
Watch out!
- What was that?
- Is everybody okay?
- I think it was an animal.
- You're bleeding.
- It's not mine.
- It must have been a dog.
Jesus Christ, my fucking car!
- Can't you see where you're going?
- It came out of nowhere.
- A dog couldn't have done that.
- A deer could.
- My dad's gonna freak on my ass.
- It was an accident.
- If it was a deer. Where is it?
- Maybe it ran off.
- I hope we didn't kill it.
- Oh, my God...
- No way.
- I thought...
- I didn't see it.
- There's no way.
This isn't happening.
Check that side.
I couldn't see it.
I swear!
- Is he dead?
- Check his pulse. You rammed him!
I think he's dead.
- Who is he?
- His face is all messed up.
- What was he doing out here?
- We've got to get an ambulance.
What's your hurry?
- The guy's dead.
- You're not a doctor.
Use your brain, Julie.
If we call the police, we're fucked.
- It was an accident.
- Let's think about this.
Think about what? He crossed the road in the middle of the night.
- You weren't drinking or speeding.
- They won't believe I was driving.
- It's my car. They'll nail my ass.
- That's not true.
I'm drunk as shit. I'm fucked!
We'll call the police and tell the truth.
It's manslaughter.
- We're gonna fry no matter what.
- Then we leave now.
Are you crazy?
- The grille's busted and bloody.
- We can clean it up.
- We're going to the police!
- We don't have time for your shit!
Let's try to stay calm.
If there's some of the car on him.
You're looking at a hit-and-run!
- Then we dump the body.
- You've lost it.
- Let's pretend we were never here.
- We'll dump him in the water.
When they find him, the evidence will be washed away.
If they found him at all.
Maybe the undertow could carry him out to sea.
I won't be any part of it.
I'm scared. Julie.
I'm not like the rest of you.
I don't have the family or money to get me out of this. Please.
This is your future, Julie. Think about college. Your scholarship.
The guy's already dead. If we go to the police, we're dead too.
- What do we do?
- Help me.
They're slowing down.
- Who is it?
- It's Max.
Get rid of him.
- Have you got car trouble?
- Actually...
Barry had too much to drink. We don't want upchuck in the new car.
- It doesn't look so new anymore.
- Yeah. Don't drink and drive.
Daddy's gonna be mad.
- What can I do for you, Max?
- Wipe that grin off your face.
Okay, Max, will do.
Have a good night.
- You got that rich boy act down.
- We'll be seeing you.
Take care. Julie.
Even if his body washes ashore, -
- he'll be eaten by crabs and small fish.
Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark.
Take him to the side.
Put him down.
- Let's do it.
- Wait.
- Should we find out who he is?
- Why?
- Just to know.
- I don't want to know.
Let's just pretend he's an escaped lunatic with a hook. Ray, help me.
- I don't think I can.
- Barry, it's not too late.
- You, just shut up!
- Christ. I'll do it.
Get him off me!
My crown!
He's got my crown!
Over here!
- Let's get out of here.
- We're going home now.
Never, under any circumstances, speak about this again.
It's now merely a future therapy bill. Agreed?
- I'll never mention it again.
- We'll make a pact.
We take this to our grave.
Julie?
- Don't nod! You fucking say it!
- Yeah, okay.
- "We take this to our grave."
- Let her go.
- You fucking say it.
- We take this to the grave.
It'll be okay.
ONE YEAR LATER
It's time to go.
Move your tired, ugly ass.
We're late.
I changed my mind.
Get your white-as-death corpse in the car.
Come on!
You're going home for the summer to get a tan on your pale tail.
Let's go.
Remember. Sun and fun.
Julie? Welcome home. Dear.
I missed you.
How's the snapper?
I really wanted monkfish, but it's been a bad season.
- Are you on drugs?
- What?
I just wanted an honest reaction.
No, Mom. No drugs.
Then what is wrong?
You look like death.
I've had a rough year.
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT
You got some mail.
Your report card came last week.
I know it looks bad.
But the summer session went well.
- It's also your last chance.
- It's not that serious.
What happened to my daughter?
You went away, and you don't call or visit.
Your father must be turning over in his grave.
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER!
Who sent this? There's no postmark or return address.
- Why? What does it say?
- Nothing.
Guys, easy...
It's called glass. It breaks.
Good morning.
Well, look what the cat drug in.
Elsa. Hi. I need to talk to Helen.
Can you give me her New York number?
- Her New York number?
- Yeah. I need to talk to her.
Helen doesn't have a New York number. Try Women's Fragrances.
Frightening, isn't it?
Julie.
- When did you get home?
- Yesterday.
- It's good to see you.
- What happened to New York?
I went for a while.
It didn't really work out.
Somebody sent this to me.
- Somebody knows.
- How?
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.
What if somebody else was there that night?
- Who? It's been a year.
- I don't know.
Has Barry seen this?
- Do you ever see Barry at school?
- It's a big campus. He is back?
- I saw his car at the gym.
- Did you guys break up?
What are you two doing here?
Hi, Barry.
"I know what you did last summer."
What a crock of shit.
- We need help.
- I'll say, you two look like shit.
You're a prick.
- We can't just ignore it.
- How do you know it's related?
- You did a lot last summer.
- Only one murder comes to mind.
You shut the hell up!
- We didn't murder anyone.
- He was still alive.
He was in the middle of the road.
- His name was David Egan.
- Who?
David Egan. He was found three weeks after we...
His body was caught in a shrimp net.
It was in the paper.
I think the police called it an accidental drowning.
But he died because of us.
That's certain.
What about Ray? Have you shown the letter to him? What does he say?
We broke up last summer. Last
I heard, he was working up north.
Let's suppose someone was there.
Why send a letter one year later?
It's probably some crack fucking around.
Max.
- Max, you think?
- Who else? He was there.
You two wait here.
I know what I'm doing.
Go figure. I was just wondering what happened to that Barry Cox.
Hey, Max. Can we talk a second, in private?
This isn't private enough for you?
What?
We got your letter.
- Don't fuck with me. You saw us.
- What the fuck are you on?
I'll say this once. I'll kill you.
I have no problem with that.
- Get off of me!
- Understand?
Motherfucker.
Don't you test me.
I'll call the cops on your ass.
- Did he admit to the letter?
- He won't bother you anymore.
I scared the shit out of him.
Well. I'll be damned.
So Ray's a fisherman.
Yeah, almost a year now.
I work on that one over there.
That's nice.
Have a nice life, guys.
I'm out of here.
Have you got a minute?
I've got to get back to work.
Call me, we can get together.
We need to talk.
- And you think Max sent it?
- Barry does.
He's probably just screwing around.
He doesn't have much else to do.
- So... how's school?
- So, you're a fisherman.
Prophecy fulfilled.
I've become my father.
- I didn't think you knew your dad.
- All I know is he worked the boats.
I know you hold me responsible for what happened last summer.
No, I'm responsible for my own actions. I don't blame you.
But I don't want to know you either.
Hello?
Hello?
I KNOW
My fucking jacket!
Hank, is anybody else here?
Just you and me.
You fucker!
Max, you're fucking dead.
Max, you're fucking dead.
Help me!
Help me! Somebody!
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
I swear. We didn't mean it.
One moment please, Officer.
- Julie...
- What happened?
No. For the fortieth time.
I couldn't see his face.
Somebody tried to kill you.
We have to go to the police.
If he wanted me dead. He could have done it. He's fucking with us.
- Who is?
- Some guy in a slicker.
That narrows it down.
This being a fishing village.
Since you bring it up...
You have a slicker.
- You're not gonna throw this on me.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
Maybe we should come clean.
No. We made a pact, and we're gonna keep it.
That's insane. Look at us.
The secret's killing us.
We're not going to the police.
We can put an end to it, and salvage a small fraction of a life.
It was murder. Julie.
Your words. Remember? Murder.
- We find this guy and fix him up.
- Like last night?
He's right. This guy won't go to the police. We'll find him, talk to him.
How do we find him?
It has to be a friend or family member of... What was his name?
- David Egan.
- Right. David Egan.
It could still be Max.
- Then find him. Prove Barry wrong.
- I just want for you and me...
Listen to me. Get something.
There is no "you and me".
I can access the local library and pull up all we need to know.
Egan... David.
- All these articles are about him?
- Yeah. Or at least mention him.
Wait. July 5th, two years ago.
What's this?
"Susie Willis drowned, trapped in a car near Dawson's Beach."
- "The driver, Egan, was unharmed."
- I remember that wreck.
Susie was engaged to David.
Her name was tattooed on his arm.
I saw it.
"Survived by his mother, Claire, and sister, Melissa, of Maribel County."
They live in the sticks.
What do you think?
What have we got to lose?
Turn right...
Back there.
Do we just say, "We killed your son and we were nearby, so..."
We play it by ear.
Angela Lansbury always had a plan.
What if they recognize us?
They could shoot us.
They could've done that already.
Jodie Foster tried this.
A serial killer opened the door.
Well, it was a good try.
Adding "breaking and entering" to our crimes?
Can I help you?
Hi. Our car stalled down the road.
Can we use your phone?
- The phone's over there.
- Thanks.
Jodie.
Will you call Triple-A?
You got it... Angela.
My name is Missy Egan.
Are you girls from Maribel?
- No, Southport.
- I went to Southport High.
- You looked familiar. What year?
- Class of '88.
Your name, "Egan", sounds familiar.
Did you have a brother?
I did, but he was younger than me.
David.
- What class was he?
- '92. But he died last July.
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.
Do you live alone?
Yeah. I do.
My daddy died a long time ago and my mother's in a home.
She didn't take too well to what happened to David.
Things haven't been the same since he died.
They're on their way.
I could make you guys a cup of tea while you're waiting.
- Thanks.
- That's nice of you.
I think I remember David.
He had a friend. What was his name?
Didn't he hang out with this guy...?
What was his name?
I didn't know too many of David's friends.
There was one guy...
He stopped by not too long after
David's death, to pay his respects.
He was a really nice guy.
He was cute and smart and...
We were sweet on each other for a minute or so. But it didn't work.
He never said it. But I think it hurt him to be around me.
- Where is this old friend now?
- Oh. I don't know.
- Do you remember his name?
- Billy.
- Did he have a last name?
- Blue. Billy Blue.
- We should wait back at the car.
- Don't be ridiculous. Stay.
- I don't want to miss Triple-A.
- We appreciate the phone.
Any time. I don't get too many knocks on my door nowadays.
- Are you okay?
- I wigged out. I'm sorry.
Being in his house and seeing his sister...
- God, do you see what we've done?
- It was an accident.
We killed a man. Then ruined the lives of everyone he knew.
We're not that powerful.
You're giving us too much credit.
- You forgot your cigarettes.
- Thank you.
- I see you got the car started.
- Yeah, it started right up.
Funny how that happens.
- So what now?
- Now we try and find Billy Blue.
Maybe he wanted to die.
- What?
- David Egan.
His girlfriend died on the same road, July 4th, one year earlier.
Maybe he was sitting in the road, waiting for us to hit him.
Yeah, if that will help you sleep at night.
What happened between us?
We used to be best friends.
We used to be a lot of things.
I miss you.
Hey, Dad.
Is the washed-up has-been having a moment?
What do you want?
We're doing inventory tomorrow.
I need you there by 10.
I can't. I'm in the parade tomorrow.
Dad put me in charge of the store, and I want you there by 10.
The outgoing queen has to ride in the parade.
It's tradition.
There's nothing I can do about it.
You and your hair...
It's so pathetic.
- You can leave now.
- So very pathetic.
SOON
What?
Oh, my God...
Max...
- Are you sure he was dead?
- I saw him... with these crabs.
You do it.
He was there. And he was wearing yourjacket, Barry.
- Did the crabs carry him away?
- I believe you, Julie.
- He took the body.
- Why would he do that?
Why did he try to run you over, and make coleslaw on Helen's head?
- Let's go back to the house.
- Where's yourjacket, Barry?
Don't you see? He's got us.
We can't go to the police now.
He's watching us and waiting.
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you doing here?
- I've been looking for you guys.
- You're gonna die.
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.
- You're fucking lying!
- Leave him alone. Get a grip.
- Wake up, Julie. He's behind this.
- He's after me. Too.
I got a letter.
A letter? I got run over,
Helen gets her hair chopped off, -
- Julie gets a body in a trunk, and you get a letter. That's balanced.
- You killed Max and took my jacket.
- Max is dead?
You always wanted to be our friend, but were too jealous to handle it.
Fuck you.
We have to stick together.
Help each other.
So if it's not fisherboy here, who is it?
- We think his name is Billy Blue.
- How do you know that?
- David had a friend by that name.
- He's probably a school friend.
According to his sister, that would make him class of '92.
Elsa was class of '92. Maybe there's something in her yearbook.
It's hard to believe that's the guy.
His face isn't splattered on the road.
- Maybe Blue's not his real name.
- He could have lied to Missy.
- If we bring the book to Missy...
- She could point him out.
I'm not going anywhere.
High school mugshots...
- I'll go. You've got that parade.
- Forget it.
- You have to, in case he shows up.
- I don't want him to!
This could be our chance.
We could catch him.
I'll go to Missy's. Barry, you go with Helen. If he shows up...
I'll pound his ass.
- You sound like vigilantes.
- It's July 4th, Ray.
Whatever he has planned is gonna happen today, unless we stop him.
Don't you see? It's that moment where we have to make a decision.
- Let's make the right one.
- I'll do what's smart, not right.
Then let's go.
Leave town. Disappear.
I have disappeared.
Now I want my life back.
We have to face this.
What's it gonna be, Ray?
Barry.
Over there!
Where the hell is he?
Missy?
Please.
Missy...
Do you remember me from the other day? The car trouble?
What are you doing here?
Please. We need to talk.
I need to find your brother's friend. Billy Blue.
- Can you look through the yearbook?
- What's this all about?
It has to do with your brother and last July 4th.
- What about it?
- What happened wasn't an accident.
- I know.
- You know what?
He killed himself.
He went up there to die where Susie died.
The whole town blamed him for her death.
- So he blamed himself.
- How do you know it was suicide?
He left a note.
I hid it from the insurance company.
They don't pay if it's suicide.
That don't much matter anymore, because the money's been spent.
I WILL NEVER FORGET
LAST SUMMER
This isn't a suicide note.
It's a death threat.
- What are you talking about?
- Your brother didn't kill himself.
I saw him. I was there and whoever sent this was there too.
- Where did you see him?
- We hit him. It was an accident.
- My brother drowned.
- "Susie" was tattooed on his arm.
He doesn't have a tattoo.
You didn't see anything. Get out!
Get out of my house.
Oh, my God...
It wasn't your brother.
- I'll be up in the balcony.
- He had a big, huge hook.
Everything's going to be all right.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Nicely done, ladies.
Now, let's meet last year's winner:
Miss Helen Shivers.
As we continue our pageant, we move into the talent competition.
Oh. Jesus.
Barry!
Somebody help him!
Excuse me.
- What's the problem?
- He's gonna kill him!
- Up in the balcony.
- Everybody stay calm.
Get off of me!
Stay behind me.
Nobody's up here. This is not my idea of a funny joke.
The fisherman was here.
He killed Barry.
There's nobody up here.
Let's go back downstairs.
Watch your step.
Ladies and gentlemen, false alarm.
We'll resume in a few minutes.
I'm gonna take you home.
Your parents are worried about you.
You have to believe me.
Let me take you home.
Excuse me.
We'll be needing this.
Come on.
So then he killed him with a fish-hook.
Did he use the same hook to cut your hair off?
No. He used a scissors. Asshole.
I know I sound delusional.
But it's true.
I heard the version with a mental patient with a hook for a hand.
We'll have to take the alley.
Look.
You little shit-stick reject...
There's been a murder. And you'll fry in hell if you ignore it.
I'll contact Barry's parents, and we'll put out a search for him.
He was probably just playing a prank on you.
Oh, Jesus. I'm just gonna see if this fella needs help.
It's him...
What's the trouble?
That's him! Behind you!
Behind you!
"Susie Willis killed.
Trapped in car."
"Survived by her father Benjamin, a local fisherman."
Elsa...
Elsa!
Open the door!
Elsa, open the door!
Jesus Christ, hurry!
What are you doing? Elsa!
Jesus Christ, hurry!
Open the door!
I'm coming.
- The Broad Street entrance is open.
- I'm being attacked.
You're what?
Lock the other door.
I'll call the police. Do what I say!
Elsa...
Elsa?
Elsa, where are you?
Ray.
Ray!
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't David Egan we killed.
It was Susie's father. Ben Willis.
- But they found David's body.
- I think Willis killed David.
- Then we killed Willis?
- But what if he didn't die?
This is crazy.
Come aboard.
- We have to find Helen and Barry.
- We will.
You...
It's you.
Billy Blue.
You went to Missy's.
- You're the friend. The fisherman.
- I can explain. Julie, wait!
- Wait.
- Stop it!
- Please, help me.
- Easy, child.
I need to call the police.
On the boat! Hurry!
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Yes. I'm in a lot of trouble.
That's a shame.
Being it's the 4th of July and all.
Kids like you should be out having fun. Drinking, partying, -
- running people over, getting away with murder, things like that.
You...
- Ben Willis.
- Good. You did your homework, too.
Welcome aboard, Ray.
Open the door, Julie.
You've got no place to hide.
Come on. Julie.
- Happy 4th of July, Julie.
- Please, it was an accident.
When you leave a man for dead, make sure he's really dead.
We never killed anyone.
This whole year was for...
The guilt was killing me.
I had to know who he was.
That's why I went to see Missy.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but I wanted you back.
I couldn't lose you again.
I love you, Julie.
No one gets me the way you do.
I understand your pain.
Do you have any idea why this man would want you dead?
None.
Here it comes.
Well, don't worry.
The body will turn up.
They usually do.
ONE YEAR LATER
I made the dean's list.
Thank you very much.
I miss you too, but I'll see you in a couple of weeks. I love New York.
Of course I love you more.
You know that.
But I've got to take a shower.
- Julie, you got some mail.
- Thanks. Deb.
A towel.
Don't start with me.
You can ravage me in two weeks.
I love you too. Bye.
POOL PARTY
THIS SATURDAY AT NOON
I STILL KNOW
It shouldn't be here.
Moving on to...
Wolf 336, F-class star... at right ascension 7.36.7.
5.21 declination.
I thought that was the last one.
Why'd you think that?
You said that it would be.
No, I distinctly remember forgetting that.
I don't know why
I put up with this.
Yes, I do.
Because I let you drive.
I'm a ride-share hostage.
F-class star.
Recent variability.
14.6 light-years away.
This is nuts anyway.
The whole approach.
SETI's tough enough on microwave band.
Now you want to search FM?
With all that noise?
Might as well look for a needle in a haystack... of needles.
Station Five.
Is my voice even vaguely familiar to you, Zane?
Honey, I'm trying to get out of here, but as usual, Calvin's holding me up.
Should be home by 1:00, 1:30.
1:30, Tuesday? Wednesday?
A.M.? P.M.?
What can I say?
I'm a ride-share hostage.
I'm going to go pee.
I will try to...
Where are you?
I'm having a drink with Becky.
You're in some bar, while I'm here working?
There's a cute hockey player here too.
But he's only in town for one night.
All right. I give up.
What do you want?
I want your ass in bed, Zane.
Okay. I'll leave now... if you leave now.
But do not talk to any strangers on the way out.
I'll see you at my place in 83 minutes, okay?
Swear you'll be there?
I don't want a repeat of last week.
If I say I'm going to be there, I will.
End of story.
There is nothing more important to me right now than our...
There is nothing more important to me right now than our...
Good solid spike.
Nice symmetry to the modulation.
Detection protocol. Now!
- Confirmation Phase One.
- Swing dish five degrees off axis.
And signal fades. Looking good.
Now swing dish back on target.
Signal returns. Definitely sky based.
Wolf 336, you are howling.
Phase Two!
Initiating software check.
Jumping ahead to Phase Three: second source verification.
Who's still on line?
Green Bank? Ohio State? Moffet Field!
Checking. Still checking.
Be there. Just be there.
We got to get another ear on this.
Software self-checks.
Phase Two complete.
Come on, Moffet.
You're killing me. I'm dying here!
Just pick up the phone so we can confirm this.
Nothing.
Zaminsky!
Zaminsky!
This is not valet parking!
Stalled out on me.
Stalled on me! This piece of...
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.
That's it?
Forty-two seconds.
We listened all night.
All night, all morning, and the sound never repeated.
It's 42 seconds of nonrandom, non-Earth-based signal!
This could be it, Gordy.
Sounds compressed, like a military burst communication.
No way. No way.
Not at 107 megahertz.
107? What the hell are you doing so far below the microwave?
Good question.
So this is a variable star, this Wolf 336?
14.6 light-years away.
All right. Okay.
So if it is a variable, it expands and contracts dramatically.
So, gentlemen, maybe you can explain to me... how intelligent life can actually develop in such a volatile environment.
It's only been unstable for what?
Fifty years or so.
Which means it's possible some form of life could still exist there.
Exactly.
Maybe this is a distress call.
An S.O.S.
Maybe they're sending out their Encyclopedia Gallactica... jettisoning all their knowledge before it goes down with the ship.
It lasted 42 seconds, and it never repeated.
That's why we have to stay on this one,
Gordy, in case it does.
I'll pull double shifts.
I'll pull triple shifts if I have to.
But I want priority status and dish time. Serious dish time.
During normal business hours, preferably.
Calvin, why don't you go home, get some sleep, okay?
Go ahead.
It's a mandatory 20% cutback.
Tracking station has a fixed operating cost. I can't touch that.
- I've got to look at personnel.
- Are you even shitting me?
I can swing a month's pay, instead of two weeks.
Maybe extend the health benefits two weeks beyond that, but...
Let me see if I got this straight.
I come to you...
I come to you with what may be... the preeminent discovery of the 20th Century: the possibility of extra-solar life.
And I get shitcanned for it?
I know how important this is.
But searching for E.T. s in this political environment... is a tough sell on Capitol Hill.
If we don't start spending money on harder science, we're going to lose it.
Let's forget about me for a second.
What about the signal?
I'm skeptical.
But it is interesting.
I'll pass it along to decoding.
See if there's a pattern recognition there, but...
I don't have to tell you.
You know the rule.
- If you can't confirm it...
- Then it doesn't exist.
What asshole made up that rule?
Can we fire him instead?
It doesn't please me... to be losing the brightest and the best.
I wish there was another way.
I honestly do.
Well, it is finally cooling off in the Southland... after a day of near-record temperatures.
But hot again tomorrow and hot again on Thursday with no letup...
How are you doing for money?
If you need me to, I could...
No. There's a SETI program up north.
Guy who runs it, Bill Wyatt, was begging me to come up.
Might call him.
You're not really thinking about going back to it, are you?
We had a bell ringer this morning.
Really good signal.
I just couldn't confirm it in time.
You had something really good last year too.
Turned out to be what?
A broken microwave oven.
What's your point? There's always something to give me false hope?
- That I'm wasting my life?
- I didn't say that.
But, you know, it's interesting that you did.
Come on.
Someone is watching.
What?
How in the hell did I wind up with somebody like you?
I got tired of rich guys with good futures.
No. Really.
What is it you see in me?
What made you call me the first time?
Boy, when their self-worth goes...
Okay, I see a man of great intelligence... dedication, cute little kind of insecurity.
- A little paranoia...
- This went to shit fast.
Why do we always have to analyze everything? Can't you trust I love you?
Algorithms I trust.
Boolean logic I trust.
Beautiful women, they just mystify me.
Two years and we're still talking about trust? It's amazing.
I should shut the hell up, huh?
Look, it's your career.
I will support any decision you make.
But if we are going to make it... we've got to take care of our problems here on planet Earth.
That is just a little hard when you're always off looking at the stars.
Listening.
Listening.
Are we falling apart here?
Is that it, Char?
I don't know, Zane.
Are we?
How'd you do on the test?
How'd you do on the test?
No, I'm saying it's incomplete.
There's no chemical breakdown.
There's no broadband chart analysis.
Want me to go on?
That information isn't available at this time.
This information was promised me two months ago.
These are not national secrets.
This is a routine analysis of the atmosphere. Why should I...
There's a problem with that satellite.
It's blind to certain trace gases.
Really? As of when?
It lost a solar panel. Some functions were shut down to save energy.
Look, here's my problem.
I've devoted my sabbatical to greenhouse trace gases.
If I don't get this data, I might as well be counting cow farts in Montana.
You'll have to wait until the new satellite is in place.
- When's the launch date?
- NASA doesn't have that information.
Round and round we go.
Thanks for naught.
Moffet Field.
Bill Wyatt, Zane Zaminsky.
How are you, man?
Oh, yeah, Zane. Hi.
I know you said you'd get back to me, but I felt obligated... to let you know about a job offer that came up.
Telecommunications.
Looks pretty sweet too.
The health plan alone, you know.
Well, good.
You should take it, Zane.
I don't think things are going to work out here.
But I thought you were looking for radio astronomers?
Some good creative thinkers?
Isn't that what you said?
Creative's one thing.
Too creative's another.
I'm not tracking.
I'm not sure
I should be saying this.
I talked to Phil Gordian at J.P.L.
- The indication was...
- Just say it.
He said you were faking signals in order to keep your job.
I do believe this permit's expired.
Why haven't you?
To raise the temperature of the planet tenfold...
To raise the temperature of the planet tenfold... to change the atmosphere into one suitable to colonization... to construct farms and cities... and build an infrastructure capable of supporting thousands of colonists.
Make no mistake.
Never before have we undertaken a task...
Have we undertaken a task of this size.
- The terraforming of Mars.
- Do you know who Phil Gordian is?
The key to all of this is polar ice.
Enough heat-generating factories could be built.
The heat would be enough to melt...
Excuse me. But perhaps you'd care to use the microphone?
Yes. Yes, I would.
Thanks.
Phil Gordian?
Has anybody seen him?
I'm looking for Phil Gordian.
Anybody seen Phil Gordian?
The man was in the middle of a seminar, Zane.
Why don't we step outside?
Let him finish.
Did you even give it to decoding?
Did you even see what was there?
Why don't we take this outside?
If you're not going to analyze it,
I want my tape back.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're referring to.
Why don't you show me how smart you are by leaving right now?
What's going on, huh?
What are you doing this for?
- Back it up. Let's go.
- Why are you telling them lies about me?
- I said, now! Let's go!
- Why?
- Come on. Let's go.
- Why?
I'm sorry. He's a troubled young man.
A very troubled young man.
My apologies. Please. Continue.
Where was I? Polar ice.
After the polar ice has been melted... the atmosphere begins to grow thicker.
Finally, a kind of critical mass is reached.
At this point, the atmosphere begins to work for us.
- Station Five.
- Tell me I'm not losing my mind.
- Just tell me.
- Zane, where are you?
They're acting like it never happened.
I saw Gordian.
It's like we never gave him any tape.
- Listen, Zane...
- But then I remembered.
It should be on the backup DAT system.
We should have a copy of the signal.
Well, yes and no.
There are some D.O.D. guys here... going through our stuff as we speak.
Apparently, it was a burst from a spy satellite.
- What?
- It's a defense thing.
Which is probably why
Gordian couldn't tell us about it.
We weren't cleared for this spy shit.
Cal, listen to me very carefully.
Satellites do not move like stars move.
We tracked this thing in stereo time, in star time, okay?
I don't know who these guys are, but I do know they're lying to you.
Is this everything?
If you haven't told them about the backup system, don't!
We have it all?
Don't you tell them, Cal!
Don't you dare!
There...
There's a backup system.
Hey.
So if this was a spy bird, why was it moving like a star?
Not really sure.
We'll have to get back to you on that.
It's a very aggressive company.
With the federal mandate for air bags...
It's a very aggressive company.
With the federal mandate for air bags... they are perfectly positioned to dominate the market for years.
Blade Co. Technologies.
All right. I'll send you a prospectus.
Are you at the same address?
Doug, can I call you back in, say, ten minutes?
- So I get this signal.
- How about 5:00?
- Signal from an F-class.
Like our sun but hotter.
- First they act like it's nothing.
- Great. Thanks.
Now they're going to unimaginable pains to make it disappear.
I thought you had a new job.
Something is going on here, Char.
Why the hell would they do that?
What is it they're trying to hide?
Maybe we could talk later.
I need to talk about this now!
- I called last night twice.
- I got the messages.
I thought the problem was
I wasn't around enough.
Now that I am, you're not.
What is this, Tales From The Dark Side?
I have been avoiding this. Yes.
Okay. Define "this."
The brokerage is strongly suggesting
I head up the office in San Diego soon.
- It'd mean moving there.
- Can you tell them no?
Thank you. I tell you I'll support any career decision you make.
- But when it comes to my work...
- You're considering this?
Char, it's Mr. Morgan on line five.
And?
I got to take this.
By any chance is he going to San Diego also?
Why don't you stick your paranoia back in your pants and get out of here?
- I will call you.
- Fine. No problem.
- When?
- Whenever I get to it.
"Tuesday? Wednesday? A.M.? P.M.?"
Go!
Right now.
They could be talking to us right now.
An array.
Phased array.
Good morning, Mr. Carbiner. I'm Horace with your local satellite company.
Good morning.
Can I see your dish?
What a glorious morning.
Hot enough for you?
For a limited time, we're offering a free upgrade on a totally automated... fiber-optic control system.
All this at no extra cost to you.
No extra cost to you.
One of the many ways we're improving the quality of service to our customers.
Can I see your dish?
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
And how soon can you leave?
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. Do you mind?
I mind you grabbing on me.
Let go!
- I'm trying to help you down.
- I can do it myself!
- My butt is stuck.
- You live next door.
With Mrs. Roosevelt.
That it?
I live in L.A.
Just kicking it here a minute.
I don't want anybody nosing around here.
If I were going to steal your stuff, it would be over and done.
What do you know about my stuff?
What are you doing climbing roofs at 1:00 in the morning?
Shouldn't you be out tagging freeway signs?
I don't got to tell you shit.
Fine. Hang there all night.
Hey! Where you going?
Get me down.
What are you doing?
I told you to wait downstairs.
What's this?
It's a cooling jacket for a low-noise amp. Don't touch it.
What's that blinky shit over there?
Will you just sit down?
Put this on your ankle.
I don't want that thing.
It's cold.
Just keep your butt down... your foot up and your mouth shut.
You can watch, but don't touch anything.
What are them dots?
They're satellite dishes.
Each one.
You string enough of them together, it makes one big radio antennae.
What's it do?
It lets you get close to the stars.
See if you get 92.9, K-BUMP.
Greetings from beyond the solar system.
- That, my friend, is Voyager 2.
- What's that?
Voyager is a planetary probe launched in the mid-'70s.
They don't teach science in school anymore?
Too busy patting us down to see if we're strapped.
I assume you mean guns.
They find one on you?
Not me. Just everyone else.
That's how come the folks want me out of L.A. Crazy stuff going on.
Can I come in now?
So, this is the star, Wolf 336.
We check the spectra at different magnifications... looking for anything unusual.
But, unfortunately, all we find is the typical radio noise of an F-class star.
But you talked to them before, huh?
The aliens? This channel?
This star, this frequency.
But we can't really talk. It takes years for a radio wave to get here.
So all we can really do is just listen.
But what'd they say? Before.
Maybe how to live forever.
Maybe how to make nuclear power safe.
I don't know. Maybe they were just ordering out for a pizza.
We won't really know what they're saying.
Not at first. But that doesn't make it less important.
If I can confirm this signal, if we can find it again... then we will finally, finally know that we're not alone.
I wonder what they're going to look like.
Warning: Your sleep period is over.
Get out of bed.
- Jesus!
- You going to try again? Tonight?
If you are, I could wait up and help some this time.
Didn't tell anybody about our little clubhouse, did you?
What am I? New?
What about your grandma?
She doesn't care if you stay up late?
- Not after 10:00.
- What happens at 10:00?
She passes out on cough syrup.
Tell you what, whenever I'm up there, you can come over.
But only, only if you got the proper I.D.
Where I get that?
What about me, huh?
When can I do something?
Okay. Hit that key.
- What one?
- That one.
- This one here?
- Yes.
- Are you sure it's okay?
- I'm sure it's okay.
- This one right under my finger?
- Give me your badge. You're fired.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
- What's this signal going to look like?
- It's just a spike.
A big one or a little one?
Because I got a big one.
That's it.
That's exactly what Calvin and I saw.
Come back!
I didn't touch nothing, okay?
That's the same thing.
Same signature, same periodicity.
What the hell?
- What is that lambada shit?
- It's got to be a bounce.
Radio wave kicks off the inversion layer, comes back in through the system.
It's coming from Earth?
Some Mexican radio station on the same frequency tells us... where the bounce came from, but it doesn't...
But it's wack. All of it?
Wait a second.
The first signal was definitely sky based. We verified it.
But this one is Earth based.
Two identical signals.
One comes from space, the other from Earth.
I'm all screwed up here.
It doesn't make any sense.
Unless they're talking.
Last night you were telling me we couldn't talk because it'd take years...
Cal. I got to talk to Cal.
I don't know. Somebody said something about a faulty heater.
- Carbon monoxide.
- Really?
- Taking him to County.
- Yeah, sure, but this guy's D.O.A.
What have we got here?
Huge concentrations of trace gas in Central Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil.
Look. You can see for yourself.
700% increase over the last five years?
- How can that be?
- My very question.
How accurate is this data you sent us, Ilana?
It's hard to say. We cobbled it together from ground stations... weather balloons,
Uncle Earl's aching corns.
Some of your numbers are there.
- No satellite data?
- NASA's bird has a bum wing.
You've obviously got some ratty data.
We checked this as best we could.
George, run me a future cast, will you?
Say, ten years, assuming the same increase.
Of course.
This had better be wrong.
According to this, we're looking at an increase of 12 degrees Centigrade... over the next decade, and that's just...
- Catastrophic.
- I was going to say impossible.
But, yes, that too.
Central Mexico.
- Excuse me.
- You come to see the ruins, my friend?
I take you to some much very good places.
Let's just head for town.
When does it start to cool off down here?
In San Marsol?
This is cool off.
This dial right?
Right, left. Both ways.
This radio station?
You know where this is?
Very far.
Not close to town.
Let's go there.
How about the ruins?
You want to see the ruins?
The radio station. I need to go there.
I'm going to talk to the people.
Accidente, he say.
But no persons was here...
When the fire come last night.
I'm too late.
One day too late.
Posada San Marsol.
One of our much very best hotels.
You see those?
These TV dishes.
- You know of any big ones?
- Big?
Big. Not small like these, but big.
Fifty, sixty feet wide. Big.
"One of our very much best hotels."
This is Peter Dowling from Sierra Satellite.
Just wondering if you were sick or dead or something.
'Cause if you're not, you're fired.
Sorry, pal.
Yeah, Zane, this is Doug.
I heard about you and Char.
I heard it was skidsville.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what it feels like.
If you want to get together anytime, let's do it.
We'll talk it through.
I'm there for ya, man, okay?
And would you mind if I got her number?
I want to talk to her about some investment possibilities.
All right? Thanks.
I called this morning.
Just didn't leave a message.
Are you there?
I guess I didn't get back to you that night... because I was mad, Zane.
I get so tired of being questioned about even the basic things.
I was feeling guilt too for steering you away from what you should be doing... from what you love the most.
But you were such an ass the last time we talked.
Damn. I can't remember if this machine lets you ramble... so I better just admit this quick.
I miss your weird paranoid brain.
Call when you can.
Where are you, Zane?
Move!
So just who the hell are you, huh?
Because I saw you in town.
I saw you at the airport.
You were waiting for me.
You knew, didn't you?
How the...
Where do you hide a 20-meter dish?
Research.
- Jesus!
- Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's going on here?
I don't know.
These guys are stealing my stuff.
They're taking my equipment.
I was trying to work here.
Excuse me. What?
Take it easy.
Will you guys take it easy?
I know I should say thanks.
But that was a pretty dicey stunt you pulled back there.
You could have got us both shot.
You're welcome, and you're right.
I saw you in town last night, didn't I?
Zane Zaminsky.
Am I still bleeding?
A little. Ilana Green.
Damn! It's hot in here.
Think they'd have air-conditioning in this place.
I don't like blood.
Why were they rousting you?
Something about my gear they don't like.
- What is all that stuff?
- It's technical.
It looks like some kind of radiosonde for atmospheric sampling.
That's right.
That's absolutely right.
Just who are you?
Can I ask what I've done wrong?
I wish to apologize to you both.
We have overreacted in this matter.
As for the equipment, it seems to be ruined. If you give me a local number...
Wait. Why was I detained?
Why did these men take my gear?
- You were on private land.
- Isn't this a public facility?
Please try to understand.
This is a new type of power station.
With new technology come those who would like to steal it.
You're staying at San Marsol, yes?
What do you mean, "new type"?
You still burn fossil fuels, right?
With great efficiency, very few emissions.
- What kind of emissions?
- I'm not an expert in this matter.
Perhaps if you were to leave me a local number...
- Perhaps if you give me...
- Call it a push. Come on.
They say there's a twin for everyone in the world.
That's not it.
Roll the genetic dice often enough, they're gonna land on top of each other.
Trust me, Ilana.
That is not it.
Nice of them to bring our cars here.
Follow me back to town, and don't make any stops, all right?
I understand you do residential work.
I've got a little weeding problem
I'm hoping you can help me with.
It's really a very small job.
Here's the address.
We saw Gulf hurricanes in March.
Right now there's a drought in the Sudan, killing thousands.
So we're talking global warming, right?
Yes and no.
Yes in that we show an increase in global temperature over the last decade.
It's not much, but if you factor out the cooling effects of volcanoes...
It's happening.
Our factories can't pump out 7 billion tons of CO2 a year and not do damage.
This is the Arctic?
Ninety miles from the Pole.
What's it doing there?
Taken by itself, it's just another anomaly.
But as a whole... The Arctic is very sensitive to environmental change.
That's why we go there.
Things happen first in the Arctic.
It's like a window on the future.
So you're talking about something a lot bigger than global warming.
I see some major climatic ordeal happening.
God.
I get so damned apocalyptic when I drink.
But you have to remember, every major turning point on this planet... including the demise of the dinosaur, began with a shift in climate.
Even a ten degree increase... will melt 70% of the polar icecap... wipe out all agriculture.
Raise the temperature of the planet to change its atmosphere... into one suitable to colonization.
- Terraforming.
- What is that?
This guy at J.P.L., he's been giving talks about Mars... and how its whole environment could be changed... and how we can terraform it and then live there.
It'll never happen, of course.
It'd cost hundreds of billions.
But he did say something about...
After the polar ice has been melted... the atmosphere again grows thicker.
Finally, a kind of critical mass is reached.
What?
I don't know.
We might give him a call if it's not too...
Jesus, I did the time warp dance here.
Before I go around saying the sky is falling or even warming...
I've got to get new gear from N-CAR.
- When do you leave?
- First thing in the morning.
- You?
- I don't know yet.
I still haven't seen everything I need to see.
Maybe a couple of days.
I must say, Zane,
I really enjoyed our talk tonight.
It's uncommon to find someone who can grasp the things I'm passionate about.
Yeah, I hear you.
Where you staying?
I was in room 302 at the big pink place... until it merged with room 402.
- Some kind of an accident?
- Everything is lately.
- How is this dump?
- It's not bad with the lights off.
- Maybe I'll get a room.
- Well, look.
I'm gone early in the morning.
Why don't you stay here now and keep the room tomorrow?
You mean, share it?
There is a couch.
We could at least keep the appearance of respectability.
I suppose we could.
Not that I don't find the proposition intriguing.
Not that you just propositioned me.
Did you?
Boy, that's a lot of guilt for someone who hasn't done anything yet.
I take it there's a warm body in bed at home.
Out of my bed, still in my head.
I don't know.
I guess there's still something to be said for abstinence. You think?
In moderation.
Terraforming. If you find anything, get it to me, in care of UCLA.
I will.
What? Yes?
Just be careful.
Change for the phone?
Man, it was good to hear your voice.
I'm really sorry about before, but I tried to...
No, no, no. You're right.
I was a complete asshole.
We will get back to that, but you still get downloads at home?
- Stock stuff?
- Yeah, but...
Planecorp Industries.
Check it out for me, will ya?
Slow modem. Still waiting.
When are you coming home, Zane?
I'm not exactly...
- Who said I was gone?
- I stopped by yesterday.
The papers were stacking up so I put them inside.
Here we go. Ticker P.L.C.,
Planecorp Industries.
A leader in clean air technology.
Blah, blah, blah.
They buy up old power utilities, overhaul and put them back on line.
Ecuador, Peru, three facilities in Mexico.
Wait a minute. Back up.
There's more than one plant?
As of January 1, they have eight facilities on line... and 12 more planned, all in third-world countries.
Twenty plants?
Where's all the money coming from?
American investors.
Your mutual funds at work.
Wow.
Well, thanks for the help, Char.
Wh... What? That's it?
After four weeks, you call me up for a stock report? l... I don't know what else to say.
How about "I miss you"?
I shouldn't have to say it.
If that's it... how big does that make the...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to see the ruins, my friend?
Mr. Zaminsky, we caught you speeding on the wrong side of the road.
Mr. Zaminsky, we caught you speeding on the wrong side of the road.
Then you said you were in the cantina last night... with Senorita what's-her-name?
Green. Ilana Green.
I suppose you were drinking.
We had a couple of beers.
That has nothing to do...
This week is El Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.
So what?
As an American, you're not familiar with these costumes... with all these things we see all around.
Wrong.
What I saw was no costume... was no paper mache skeleton.
It was nothing like that.
The captain of security for the power station has called... to report an accident.
That a man, intoxicated... killed someone with his car last night.
An American man.
No, that is not what happened.
- That is to say you were involved.
- They are lying!
It's up to me to decide who's lying.
That's why I make the questions, and you give me answers.
Now, again, were you involved in this?
I hit something... with the car.
Now, who it was or what it was,
I'm not sure.
But if they're saying I killed someone, I want to see it.
Bring the body.
I demand to see it!
There's no need to demand that,
Mr. Zaminsky.
That's exactly what they're doing.
Don't go anywhere.
Our word for an attorney is abogado.
I suggest you...
Mercury peaks around 99 degrees today.
Yes, that will be a record for this day in October.
But nowhere is it hotter right now than in the hallways of NASA... where officials are still trying to explain... what happened yesterday to that atmospheric satellite... that blew up just 32 seconds after launch.
Press conference now underway at J.P.L. in Pasadena.
Anybody gonna lose their job over this?
I'm really not the right p...
You don't look too good.
Actually, I look like a can of smashed assholes.
Here's a tip.
If you ever get the chance to travel with a Mexican rodeo... pass.
Look, Zane, about before, I'm sorry.
D.O.D. was putting pressure on me to keep a lid on things.
Then you start asking questions in front of all those people.
No, no. Forget it.
No hard feelings.
I just wanted to drop by and pay you a visit... check up on my old buddy Gordy... maybe see what's really what... who's really who.
I tell you, Zane, you're really not making very much sense.
We should walk over to the infirmary.
It didn't make a lot of sense to me either... the first time I saw your face on another guy.
Genetic dice?
No, I don't think so.
I think somebody just screwed up.
As good as you are, you do make mistakes, don't you?
They should have broke the mold, Gordy.
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
I wanna blow a hole in your head and donate your organs to science.
But there are a few things
I need to know first.
Fuckin' N.R.A.
It's just so easy to get one.
Let's have a chat.
Yeah. Okay.
Media Center. Looks like somebody stole some camera gear.
- You want it?
- A real crime.
Somebody's on the way.
So who was targeted?
Anyone in SETI?
Well, not anyone.
Who then?
Look in the mirror.
Prime intellect.
Nonconformist reasoning.
Capacity for lateral thinking.
- Isn't that what you see?
- And then what?
A control is assigned?
Somebody like you?
Could I actually see this gun of yours, Zane?
Oh, sure. But if I pull it out, it'll be the last thing you ever see.
Well, I think it's possible to say... that you've been watched for quite a while now.
So which programs besides SETI? NASA?
Ask yourself why an antenna won't deploy on a deep-space probe.
Or ask how they could launch a $6 billion telescope... without testing its mirror.
- What you're actually saying...
- I'm saying nothing.
I'm just listening to you ask questions.
Then I'll ask about Planecorp.
Planecorp.
Sorry, I don't know what that is.
You know, it's that factory down in Mexico.
It's outside my knowledge.
One of 20 being built in third-world countries.
- Outside.
- Where no laws protect the air.
- Outside my knowledge.
- You build where it's hot.
You like it hot, Gordy, don't you?
Zane, if you force me to answer you... what you will be hearing is your own death sentence.
Now, as much as you think you know, you don't know the half of it.
Right now, you're just one little guy with a big conspiracy theory... and no proof, and the world is full of them.
So, Zane, you take great care... in what else you choose to learn.
They're terraform factories?
- Yes.
- You're pumping out greenhouse gas.
- Now you're dead.
- You're changing the air... the temperature, the whole ecosystem.
We're just finishing what you started.
What would've taken you 100 years we'll do in 10.
Just speeding along your own demise.
Like you sped Calvin along, and Ilana Green, right?
If you can't tend to your own planet... none of you deserve to live here.
Bang. You're dead.
Don't tell me that's who I think it is.
We have a problem here?
No. No problem.
I'm gonna handle this myself.
Geez!
Zane, what are you doing out here?
You scared the living...
Who's been here? Anyone?
- Anybody been watching my house?
- Nobody I seen.
I can't believe they wouldn't be.
I'm gonna say something that's gonna sound completely insane.
I'm telling you because I think you might actually believe me.
I'm also telling you because
I can't be the only one who knows... in case they find me...
- before I finish this.
- Tell me.
I followed the signal to Mexico because we thought somebody was...
Yeah, yeah.
They weren't "us," Kiki.
So what was they?
Do they got these little flashlight fingers that...
Maybe they got these big metal teeth that come out and sort of...
What does they look like then?
Like you. Like me. Like anyone.
- What they doing here?
- I'll show you.
I'll show everyone, as soon as I fire up the array.
Shit!
You've been evicted.
I gotta get out to Oro Valley, out to the big dish.
Hold this. Don't drop it.
What game does it play?
Where's the start button?
- You going to let me in?
- Who's Char?
I can't stay. If they're not here now, they will be soon.
Who? The police?
What about the police?
They came to my work, some detective.
He said something about manslaughter charges in Mexico.
You're a fugitive?
Ooh, that's phat.
The whole thing was fabricated.
They set me up.
I don't understand.
Why would the police want to...
Not the police.
It was them.
Them. Who's them?
- Forget it.
- Probably the aliens.
Who is this child?
And I hope he means illegal aliens.
I'll take your car.
Give me that.
No, you won't.
Not until I know what is going on here.
Look, it sounds nuts, but I know what I saw.
I know why they're here. I know about the poppy field in the Arctic.
Their whole master plan about the air and the...
Give me the keys.
I can't let you go, Zane.
Not alone, not like this.
You don't have to come. I wouldn't believe it unless I'd seen it myself.
But, Char, I must leave now.
If you think I'm letting you out of my sight, you are nuts.
Can I come?
Get off me!
This isn't a field trip.
I left my grandma a note.
I want to help.
Drive!
Pull over at the on-ramp.
I'll drive.
I've got shotgun.
Zane, I think that you've got to deal with this somehow.
If it means both of us going to the police and explain...
I can't get stuck in some jail.
Not now.
Please, pull over.
We're here. Now, what do you hope to accomplish?
Keys. Keys.
Where's Char?
What are you doing?
Getting my stuff out of the car.
That all right?
I just... The strangest thoughts.
Kiki, if it says "power," you push it.
These monitors, this stuff here.
Light it up... everything.
Find OMNI Star 5.
I'll need two sets of coordinates.
Right ascension and declination.
I don't see how listening to some star...
It's not a star, and this time we're talking, not listening.
So this is some kind of satellite in orbit?
It's a co-op weather satellite... one that about 50 TV stations pull a continuous feed off of.
A hundred thousand watts ought to get their attention.
- They'll understand what this means?
- We're gonna find out... right now.
Shit.
What's happening?
What is wrong with this thing?
Gardening. I didn't see any gardens around here.
What are they doing here, Char?
Like I should know.
You made a call... from the car.
When you start talking about aliens and master plans... and this woman being killed in Mexico...
Did I mention that it was a woman?
The police told me, okay?
Ah. And that's who you called, right, Char?
- You called the police.
- Yes, it is.
You were scaring me with your talk.
You're scaring me now.
As soon as I left SETI, you left.
As soon as I got back from Mexico, there you were, waiting for me.
Because I thought you might need me, Zane.
Like I needed all that career advice?
The gentle persuasion... the little nudges about how
I was wasting my life!
Cold. Too cold.
I'm sorry.
I am just so sorry.
I didn't believe about...
You've got to trust me when I say that I only called the police...
- and only because I wanted...
- Then what are they doing here?
Who told them to find me here?
I don't know.
I honestly do not know.
Watch this screen.
When you see my face, hit the red key right there next to you.
- The transmit key.
- You ain't leaving me here?
Don't worry.
They'll be chasing us.
We're going to give this one more shot.
Go.
No, it's this way. Go.
Give me the chain.
You can move the dish from here.
Go. I can do this.
For once in your paranoid life, please just trust me.
Now, Kiki.
Now, Kiki! Hit it now!
Kiki, the red transmit key.
Hit it now!
Kiki, for shit's sake, hit it now!
Now! Now!
Hit it now!
Like I said.
You didn't know the half of it.
Zane, what happened?
Why did they leave?
They didn't.
How do you know?
Because we aren't dead yet.
Help me.
Move!
Zane, can we get out of here now?
Not that way.
I'll be right behind you.
Not... so... fast.
Oh, please. Oh, please.
Please.
Why did it have to be like this?
Why couldn't you just come and ask for our help?
Then you tell them...
You go back and tell them... that I know, that she knows... that others will know!
It's not going to be easy.
Not anymore.
Summer is just refusing to go away.
Record highs again in the Big Apple... while New England states report a delay of the fall foliage season.
It's been warmer than normal up and down the Eastern seaboard.
They're terraform factories?
- Yes.
- You're pumping out greenhouse gas.
- Now you're dead.
- You're changing the air... the temperature, the whole ecosystem.
We're just finishing what you started.
What would've taken you 100 years we'll do in 10.
Just speeding along your own demise.
Like you sped Calvin along, and Ilana Green, right?
If you can't tend to your own planet... none of you deserve to live here.
More blood!
Great. Keep coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.
Don't be stingy.
Watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.
Chase, keep that claw really moving.
Jeffrey, jam it on there just like Freddy would.
Good, good. And cut!
Print that, Gretchen.
Chase, you're a genius.
This makes his old claw look like Mother Teresa's mitten.
You better thank them.
They're very sensitive.
Chuck, Terry, great blood.
- Thank you very much.
- Some of our best work.
Hey, monkey man, want to see some neat stuff?
Come on.
It's only make-Believe.
Marianne, I gotta go.
Low bridge.
Let's see if we can scare the P.J.'S off Mommy.
Hey, Heather.
You hungry, Dylan?
Gotcha.
It should have flexed more.
I think the servos got shorted out with blood.
Well, take it apart, pull it out... and insulate them with some styro.
The thing wasn't meant to be submerged, for Pete's sake.
I don't like that thing.
That thing puts bread on our table.
Is it alive, Daddy?
Heather, you're in the next shot.
State-Of-The-Art animatronics with bio-Organic grafting.
Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a live Doberman.
Must've have picked up a signal from an eighties walkie-talkie.
- Sure it's off?
- It's off.
Funny, it's warm... just like a real hand.
Oh, God.
What the hell's going on here?
Cut the effects!
Terry, where is it? Terry!
Chuck, get off me!
Heather, where is it?
Chase, where the hell is it?
Come on.
What the fuck?!
Earthquake. Come on.
Mommy!
What is that?
Car alarms.
You OK?
You OK, chief?
Honey, do you have a fever?
Just another earthquake, Dylan.
Getting kind of fun, huh?
Daddy. Blood.
It's nothing, guys.
It's a scratch. Really.
Where did you get that?
I don't know. Picture, I guess.
When it fell. It's no big deal.
Put a bandage on it.
Don't worry about it.
Geologists at Cal Tech... have confirmed this morning's aftershock...
Do we have to watch that?
...five-point-three on the Richter scale.
Thought you turned it on.
It was strong enough to cause further collapse... of the already badly damaged parking structure...
I'll turn it off.
Officials say that this is normal... following a quake of last week's magnitude... now thought to be a massive 6.8.
Dylan, this is breakfast, not arts and crafts.
What?
Did you get any sleep last night?
More or less.
OK, time to get dressed.
I'm late.
You going away?
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.
Is there anything other than the obvious bothering you?
I think five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another phone call, has there?
Good sign.
Two full weeks without him.
Maybe he got hit by a truck.
He's closer, if anything.
It's giving me nightmares,
Chase.
Did you have one last night?
It's just the earthquakes,
Heather.
Maybe.
Maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No. You gotta get back on the horse sometime.
Look, you had a nut case making harassing phone calls.
I know how scary that's been.
No, you don't.
OK, I don't.
But it doesn't mean that it can't be over.
But what if it isn't over?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
It was nothing. I was... you and I were working on this movie, together for once... and one of your special effects went really wrong.
And Chuck and Terry got hurt... and... well, your fingers were cut.
Right here?
Heather, you were probably half awake... and saw my fingers get nicked when the mirror fell.
Dreams are like that.
Look, if you don't want me to go on this job, I won't.
Just be careful, OK?
I think I can survive two days in Palm Springs... supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial.
I guess so.
You guess so?
Come here.
Forty-eight hours.
I'll be back in no time.
I gotta go.
I love what you've done with the place.
Knock 'em dead.
Dylan, I gotta go.
Take care of Mommy.
Nancy.
Dylan, I don't want you watching this.
Dylan, what's wrong?
What's wrong?!
What's happening to you?
One, two...
Freddy's coming for you!
Someone's coming.
What?
Are you OK, honey?
Is everything OK?
It's just these quakes.
Did you feel one just now?
No. A big truck went by before you opened the door.
It's life on the fault line.
- Hey, tiger.
- Hi, Julie.
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning.
No, he seems OK.
Are you sure that's all that's wrong?
Leave us alone, you son of a bitch!
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.
Just wanted you to know
I'm out front.
I'm sorry.
Can you hang on a minute?
What is it?
I don't know.
I just have this weird feeling today.
Mommy? Stay home, then.
This damn caller.
He's started again?
Sick fuck.
Sorry.
Dylan doesn't seem to have a fever.
It's probably just your nerves.
Nerves?
I just meant from the shaker this morning.
Everybody's freaked out about how many we've been having.
And then these phone calls.
Don't answer it.
Excuse me, ma'am, but we are going to be late.
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
Bye.
I'll call the cops for you.
You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Give them the time they called... and they're keeping this list, supposedly.
Julie, I'm really sorry.
My nerves are a little raw these days.
It's OK.
Yeah. I gotta go.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
You played that girl.
In that movie.
With the guy with the...
Yeah, sure. That's you.
That's what I love about this job.
I get to meet the stars.
I'm hardly a star.
What, are you kidding?
I love your stuff.
The first was the best.
Where the girlfriend's cut open and dragged across the ceiling.
It was awesome.
And when all that blood comes out of your boyfriend's bed?
I thought I'd shit.
But they never should have killed off Freddy.
Heather, look, we gotta go.
Cutting it close, aren't you?
You trying to get me fired?
OK! We're coming!
So, Heather, we're approaching the tenth anniversary... of this whole
"Nightmare on Elm Street" thing.
I mean, the original, five very popular sequels.
How has all the success affected you personally?
I don't know if it really has, Sam.
God. With the exception of One and Three...
I pretty much stayed out of it.
Well, I'm doing a lot more television now... so those hours let me spend a lot more time... with my husband and my little boy.
You have a little boy.
What's his name?
Dylan.
With Dylan, does that change your feeling... your perspective about horror movies?
No, not really.
Would you let him see one of your movies?
My son? No.
I'm sure people ask you this all the time...
Is there going to be another sequel... and what's more, is Freddy really dead?
Of course he is.
Freddy's dead and gone.
And how about your co-Star in the original... would you trust him alone with Dylan?
Robert? I don't know.
Why don't we ask him how he'd feel about it?
We've got a big surprise for you and for our audience.
Let's bring him out.
He is the best of the bad.
Let's say hello to Robert Englund.
Love ya, babe!
We'll do lunch!
I'm alive once again!
Freddy's back! Give it up for your Uncle Freddy!
Just when you thought it was safe to get back into bed!
Give me five!
I'm back, and I'm badder than ever!
You are all my children now!
I got to go, Robert.
Just a second. I'll walk you.
There you go, kids.
- Thank you.
- Bye-Bye.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
Well, everything went great,
I thought.
We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me.
Come on. They loved the expression on your face.
I think they'd like to see us together again.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Just because it's a love story... doesn't mean you can't have a decapitation or two.
- There's a call for you.
- For me?
I'll talk to you later.
Heather, it's Sara Risher over at New Line Cinema.
How are you?
How are you?
This is a voice from the past.
It sure is.
Listen, Heather,
I won't take but a minute.
It's just that we have something to propose to you... and I wonder if you'd stop by the offices.
Bob would love to talk to you.
Sure. When?
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.
- Now?
-Just take a minute.
You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Bye.
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Bob Shaye.
Was Bob expecting you?
Sara. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Great to see you.
- You look great.
- Thank you.
Bob is dying to see you.
Can I get you something?
- Coffee would be fine.
- Black?
- Black's fine.
- Could you get us some coffee?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I think the guy is a little bit of a jerk... but we won't know until we've read the script.
Anyhow, I'll give you a call when I...
Listen, man, I got to go.
Call me when you get to Milan... and don't forget... risotto con tartufi.
It's fantastico!
Take care, man.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Boy, do you look great, Heather.
- How are you?
- Great. I'm fine.
And I don't have to ask how you're doing.
Well, so far so good.
Which is why we asked you to come by today.
- Thanks, Kim.
- Sure.
Look, Heather, let me cut to the chase.
How would you like to join us in the definitive "Nightmare"?
I thought you killed Freddy off.
Well, we did, but the fans...
God bless them, they're clamouring for more.
I guess evil never dies, right?
Anyhow, a few weeks ago,
I got a call from Wes... and he pitched me this really ex citing idea... and I started thinking...
"who better to resurrect
Freddy than his creator?"
I thought Wes stopped doing horror movies.
He actually told me he hadn't called in the last ten years... because he hadn't had any really scary nightmares.
They're his inspiration for this thing.
Anyhow, he's right in the middle of the script.
Which means he's having nightmares again.
He's very excited about it.
- The nightmares?
- No, the script.
And you should be, too, because you're the star.
I don't know, Bob.
I'm flattered, really, but I have a kid now.
Well, so?
So I'm not sure about doing horror.
Come on, Heather.
Kids love horror.
Thank you so much, Bob.
I have other things happening.
Look, we'll match any offer that's on the table for you.
No, it's not that.
Look, I have a fan.
Heather, you got plenty of fans.
We've been doing marketing research on you.
You are rating right up there.
We've got Chase working on a prototype for the new glove.
What?
We asked him to kind of keep it as a surprise... until you and I could have this conversation.
How long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't know.
A couple of months. Why?
And since you've been thinking of making it... has anything funny happened?
What do you mean?
Like weird phone calls.
Or nightmares.
Why don't you answer your phone, Bob?
That's what we got people we pay around here for.
Will someone pick up the damn phone?
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
What the...
Never sleep again.
What is going on?
You didn't let him watch the movie on TV, did you?
Movie? He didn't watch anything on TV.
He was taking his nap, and I heard him screaming.
Honey, are you OK?
Rex saved me.
He did?
Is Rex going to die?
Rex is not going to die.
I promise you, sweetie.
Do you know where the sewing stuff is in the kitchen?
Sure.
We'll do an operation, OK?
Come on.
Dr Dylan and Dr Julie.
Fix him up good as new, OK?
Hey, Chase. You've got a call.
It's your wife.
Chase, you better come home.
Heather, I'm stuck here.
Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.
Why? What's the matter?
- Chase, it's Dylan.
- What?
Hold on.
The phone's breaking up.
What's going on with Dylan?
He's had some sort of an episode.
What?
What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strangely.
Like somebody was after him.
It's scary. It scared me.
He was acting like...
Like what?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another phone call?
Why didn't you tell me you were working on a new glove?
And why aren't Chuck and Terry at work today?
Forget those clowns. Answer me.
Has there been another phone call today or not?
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.
- Danny, I got to go.
- What's up?
My kid's sick. I got to fly.
"As soon as the sun was up...
"the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.
"'We will bake cookies first,' she said.
"'I've heated the oven and kneaded the dough.
"'Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.'
"And she pushed Gretel toward the oven.
"The witch went to shut the door and bake her inside."
This is so violent.
I don't know why you like these stupid old fairy tales.
Finish, please.
- They'll give you nightmares.
- I like this story.
"But Gretel guessed what the witch was planning.
"'I don't know how to get in,' Gretel said.
"'How am I to manage it?'
"'Stupid girl,' shouted the witch, rushing to the oven.
"'The opening is big enough.
See? I can fit myself. '
"Quickly, Gretel came behind and pushed with all her might...
"plunging the wicked old woman headlong into the flames...
"banging the door shut and bolting it tight.
"The witch howled..."
That's enough.
"The witch howled like a scalded cat...
"but Gretel ran and left her there to perish nonetheless.
"She ran to her brother as fast as she could...
"flung open the door.
'Hansel! Hansel,' she cried.
"We're saved!
The witch is dead."
Time for sleep.
Say how they find their way back home.
- Tomorrow night.
- No. Tonight.
It's important.
Dylan, you know as well as I do.
They followed the trail of breadcrumbs back to their house.
And then their father covered them with kisses... and they were safe.
They were safe, and they could sleep.
- What is that?
- Rex.
Come on.
Rex keeps him down there.
Who?
The mean old man with the claws.
He wants to come up while we sleep.
I keep my feet up here.
Rex keeps him down there.
He's my guard.
You should have a guard, too.
There's nothing down there.
Come here.
Look. See?
It's different when you're gone.
Come on.
On, please.
OK, sweetie.
Night-Night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- Daddy coming home?
- He's on his way.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Right.
If the birds don't eat them first.
Perfect, perfect, perfect!
Come on, come on, come on.
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot
Light
Light
Losin' my
Religion
Mommy's scared?
Dylan, Mommy's fine.
It was just a bad dream.
What are you doing out of bed?
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting.
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.
I'm not sleepy.
Police, ma'am.
Will you open the door?
Heather Langenkamp?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
There was an accident.
It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
Is he... I mean...
Is he hurt?
I'm afraid it's worse than that, ma'am.
Is he dead?
Yes, ma'am.
Are you sure it's him?
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.
I want to see his body.
No, you don't, ma'am.
It's not necessary.
I want to see it for myself.
- Can you hand me that?
- Sure.
Excuse me.
- Could I help you?
- Porter.
Chase Porter.
It's back here.
You said Chase?
I'm sorry.
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.
I'd like to see once again.
I'm sorry?
Could you lift the sheet again, please?
More, please.
What is that?
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.
The head's gonna be all right for the funeral, but...
Hey, lady. You OK?
You sure?
Oh, God. What did that?
They said the truck was tore up something awful... so you can imagine him not being in... well, exactly top shape.
It looks like he was clawed.
That's why we don't lift the sheet past the face, ma'am.
Sometimes it's what we don't see that gets us through the night.
So, if you'll just sign...
God is our hope and strength... a very present help in trouble.
Therefore, we will not fear... though the earth be moved... and though the hills be carried... into the midst of the sea... though the waters thereof rage and swell... and though the mountains shake... at the tempest of the same.
-Julie, where's Dylan?
- I don't know.
Dylan, grab Mommy's hand.
Grab it!
Oh, my God!
Hurry!
Let go of me!
Stay with me.
Stay with me, Heather.
- Where's Dylan?
- He's all right.
He's right here.
- What happened?
- Earthquake.
You got knocked off your feet.
You got a pretty good bump, actually.
May he rest in peace, children.
And may you all get home safely.
Amen.
If there's anything
I can do, Heather... anything.
Thank you, Robert.
Sweetie.
Tina?
Who are you?
Baby, wake up.
Honey. Dylan.
Dylan, get over here!
Honey! Honey!
Come on.
OK, sugar, we're gonna go back to bed now.
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.
Honey, you have to sleep.
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Where did you hear that?
Did you hear that on that movie?
Did you answer the phone?
Dylan, where did you hear that song?
In my bed.
In your bed?
Under my covers. Kids singing.
Way down there with the man.
The mean man.
What is that man doing?
Trying to get up.
Trying to get up into our world.
Where's Daddy now?
Daddy's in heaven.
He's with God now.
Do you have to die to see God?
I don't think so.
I think you have to pray.
And reach out.
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know, honey.
Please try to get some sleep.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
I think that only happens in the movies.
But I'll always, always... be right here when you get back.
And I'll make sure that nobody gets your toes.
I know his behaviour is bizarre... but he's usually so normal and well adjusted, John...
I can't believe it's him... and not something outside influencing him.
Or is that how denial works?
It is denial.
I don't think that's the case here.
If you're really worried about Dylan... have a doctor check him out.
You'll see. Everything's fine.
You're not just saying that to help a crazy friend cope?
Everything about Dylan's behaviour is understandable... for a kid who just lost his father.
How does a child process a thing like that?
I don't know.
I've not been able to process it very well myself.
And you're not crazy, by the way.
Seeing Freddy in that grave and then jumping in... you didn't jump in.
That's my memory.
It seemed absolutely real.
"Seemed," not "was."
It's in my family, you know.
What is?
A very close relative died in an institution.
Really? If having a screwy family made a person crazy... the whole world would be one big loony bin.
You have a crazed fan after you.
That's what's making you crazy.
Probably Dylan, too.
I never mentioned that to him.
Kids know when something's bugging the parent.
You have no idea who this is calling?
- Freddy, for all I know.
- Come on.
He's a man.
Or a boy with a deep Freddy voice.
Six weeks, and you're surprised you got Freddy in your dreams?
Hell, Sonny Bono, after a while... began seeing his stalker everywhere, even at Mass.
Really?
How many times did Letterman call the cops... thinking that woman was down in the kitchen again?
Really gets under your skin if you let it.
You really think Dylan's OK?
Dylan's fine. You're fine.
You're hurting, but you're fine... and you're definitely not crazy.
My worst fear... that whatever madness is in my family I have... and I've passed it onto Dylan.
- Make sure he's OK, John.
- Are you all right?
Are you OK? Are you sure?
Does anything hurt?
Dylan, are you all right?
Honey, are you all right?
Are you sure?
God wouldn't take me.
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.
It's unbelievable.
- You doing all right?
- Hanging in there.
You know the guy that was calling me all the time?
He started again... and he's putting stuff in my mail again.
Listen, the S.O.B. Probably read about the funeral... in the papers or something.
Sick mother.
That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.
Wait a second.
Now, let me get this straight.
You're having nightmares about Freddy? As in me?
No. It isn't you. He's scarier.
He's...
Darker?
More evil?
Yeah. How did you know?
Call it a guess.
Pretty damn good guess.
Anyway what I was calling about was... have you seen any of the script by any chance?
No. Wes won't show it until he's finished.
At least that's what he told me.
When is it gonna be done?
The way he's writing, who knows?
It's so weird.
I asked him how far he was at the funeral.
What did he say? Oh, yeah.
"As far as Dylan trying to reach God."
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?
Putting your kid in the script.
Robert... have you been having nightmares?
Look, we need to talk, but not over the phone.
Can I come over?
Actually, Heather... today's no good.
There's something
I have to finish.
Tomorrow maybe, huh?
OK, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.
And meanwhile, Robert, take care, OK?
Yeah. Sure.
Damn it!
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, grab your crucifix
Seven, eight, better stay up late
Dylan, don't sing that song.
Nine, ten, never sleep again!
Dylan! Stop it!
No! Don't!
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
I touched him.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Diabetes?
Was there a trigger event, trauma, shock?
You haven't shown him the films you've made, have you?
The horror stuff?
His father just passed away.
I'm sorry.
But I'm convinced those films can tip... an unstable child over the edge.
Unstable?
Dylan's not unstable.
He's just upset.
We'll run a battery of tests and know in a few days.
Does he have to stay overnight?
Absolutely.
Anything more happen we need to know about?
Like what?
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes... will give a clue to what ails him.
Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
What do we have here?
Too soon to know for sure.
The early symptoms point to childhood schizophrenia.
Dylan, can you hear me?
Dylan, you have to fight it, whatever is after you... and you got to come back to me.
You can't make it alone.
Do you hear?
If you can hear me, tell me what you need to feel safe.
Rex? Is that what you want?
Well, Rex is at home, and that's where you should be.
But you got to get better before they'll let you come home.
Do you understand?
Home.
Home. Home, that's right.
That's where I want you, sweetie.
And, you know, we're not that far away.
Look right out there.
Past the freeway is our home.
But to get there, you have to come out from where you are... so that they'll let you come home to Rex.
And to me.
Time for your medicine, cowboy.
- Here you go.
- What is that?
Something to help him sleep.
There you go. It looks good.
There you go.
Good. Good. Attaboy.
Come on, lie down and take a little nap.
You should get some rest, too.
He's going to be fine.
We're gonna do some tests... and then you can come back later.
Can you get that other side, please?
I grabbed his things.
These are his favourite pyjamas here.
Honey, I've got to go.
I love you, Dylan.
Remember what I said.
We'll take care of everything.
Wake up, lady!
Don't lose it now!
Seismologists at Cal Tech... have counted over 300 temblors so far.
Though most were too faint for us to feel... seven have shaken our community in the last few weeks... and now scientists are speculating... there might be an unknown fault running beneath Los Angeles... a fault that could...
Hi. You've reached the Englund residence.
We're out of town.
You can leave a message if you wish, but... we'll be gone for some time.
I wish I could tell you where the script was going.
The fact is I don't know.
I dream a scene at night,
I write it down in the morning.
Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine where it's going.
At least tell me what it's about so far.
- Coffee.
- Thanks.
I can tell you what the nightmare's about so far.
It's about this entity... whatever you want to call it.
It's old. It's very old.
It's existed in different forms in different times.
The only thing that stays the same is what it lives for.
What is that?
The murder of innocents.
This is still a script we're talking about, right, Wes?
I sort of think of it as a nightmare in progress.
In this nightmare in progress... does this thing have any weaknesses?
It can be captured sometimes.
Captured? How?
By storytellers, of all things.
Every so often, they imagine a story good enough... to sort of catch its essence.
Then, for a while, it's held prisoner in the story.
- Like the genie in the bottle.
- Exactly.
But the problem comes when the story dies.
And that can happen in a lot of ways.
It can get too familiar... or somebody waters it down to make it an easier sell... or maybe it's so upsetting that it's banned outright.
However it happens, when the story dies... the evil is set free.
You're saying Freddy is this ancient thing?
Right. The current version.
And for ten years, he's been held captive as Freddy... in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, but... now that the films have ended, the genie's out of the bottle.
That's what the nightmares are telling me and I'm writing.
If Freddy's loose in your script, where's he going?
Another age? Another form?
No, that's not what the dreams have him doing.
What is he doing?
He's sort of gotten used to being Freddy now... and he likes our time and space... so he's decided to cross over out of films into our reality.
Isn't there somebody who can stop him?
Actually there is a person in the dream... sort of a gatekeeper, so to speak.
Somebody Freddy has to get by... before he can come into our world.
That person's you, Heather.
It's me?
Why me?
Dramatically speaking, it makes perfect sense.
You played Nancy, after all.
You were the first to humiliate him, defeat him.
That was Nancy. Not me.
But you gave Nancy her strength.
So in order to get out, he's got to come through you.
He's gonna try to do that at your most vulnerable points.
Oh, my God, Wes.
Did you know?
It was a script.
It was a dream.
I didn't know.
You know damn well it's more than that now.
How can we stop him?
The only way is to make another movie.
I swear, I'm gonna stay by this computer... and keep writing until I finish the script, but... when that time comes, you'll have to make a choice.
Choice?
What kind of choice?
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
"Many of the symptoms of childhood schizophrenia...
"are duplicated in children...
"suffering from sleep deprivation."
"Sleep deprivation can produce trance-Like states...
"mechanical behaviour.
"The child might..."
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting the mean old man with the claws.
You have no idea who this is calling?
Freddy, for all I know.
As in me?
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.
Darker, more evil?
How did you know?
He's decided to cross over, out of films, into our reality.
Never sleep again.
The world of horror films suffered its own terror today... as two of Hollywood's best known special-Effects technicians... were found dead in a vacant field.
Terrance Feinstein and Charles Wilson... two special-effects artists... reputedly working on a top-Secret project... for the makers of the Freddy Krueger films... were found brutally slashed to death early this morning.
Freddy's glove was missing... and police are speculating the murders were the result... of a botched theft... which apparently took place two days ago.
At this point, the murder weapon has not...
Oh, God.
Miss me?
Nancy.
There are no visiting hours this late.
You must understand.
No, I don't understand.
I told you I'm his baby-sitter.
I'm a close friend of the family, damn it.
I just need to see him for a minute.
Sixty seconds. Come on.
You have to understand.
You can't see him.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I had this really terrible dream about Dylan.
I had to come and see him.
You must think I'm crazy.
No, I don't.
Is he all right?
I don't know.
They wouldn't let me in.
There are no evening visiting hours in intensive care.
Is he all right?
Dylan? He's holding well.
Earlier he had some problems.
- He's in an oxygen tent now.
- Oh, my God.
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp. May I?
Those are nasty cuts.
How did you get them?
It happened in the earthquake.
I fell.
I need to see Dylan.
In a moment.
First let's see about you.
If these had been a few inches nearer the wrist... what did you say you cut yourself on?
It was the earthquake.
It was dark. I have no idea.
But these look quite fresh.
They are. It happened in tonight's earthquake.
It happened just 15 minutes ago.
You must have felt it.
Guess we lucked out over here.
Your son... is apparently terrified of a man... someone he thinks is going to come out of his bed.
One of the nurses heard him talking to himself.
Do you have any idea who that man is?
I forgot to bring his dinosaur Rex.
He keeps Freddy from coming up out of his... bed.
The man from your films?
Freddy Krueger?
With the claws?
Is that who he's afraid of?
You have let your child see your films, haven't you?
Every kid knows who Freddy is.
He's like Santa Claus... or King Kong or... well, interesting talking with you, Miss Langenkamp.
I hope you understand.
My concerns are simply for the welfare of your son.
How's he doing?
Honey.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Too late.
I'm almost there, Heather.
Almost there.
Daddy!
- Doctor!
- Keep her right there.
We can't hold him much longer.
Get the full anaesthetic, stat.
We don't have that here.
No anaesthetic, you say?
Screw it. I'm going in.
Little booger's full of something I don't like.
Let's get him open, good and proper.
Cut this evil out of him.
- Gloria!
- He's got my baby!
- Who?
- Freddy!
Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?
- What the hell's going on?
- My baby!
Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.
I suggest you go home and get some rest.
Your son is fine.
He's downstairs for further testing.
But he was just here.
He was here, you fell asleep, we took him.
You looked so exhausted... frankly, we didn't want to wake you.
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.
That's his baby-Sitter, right?
Believe me. Everything is fine.
Everything's not fine.
Damn!
Call security.
Security, code yellow.
Pediatric testing.
This is a restricted area.
Do you have a pass?
Screw your pass.
It's all right.
Where is he?
Just stay calm.
How's her little boy doing?
He's fine, actually.
He came around about ten minutes ago.
He seems to be suffering from acute sleep deprivation.
I don't think she ever lets him sleep.
What are you saying?
Where is he?
I've got someone here who wants to see you.
Are you OK, champ?
Can we go get Rex now?
The bad man's getting awful close.
I know he is.
We're gonna go get Rex right now.
I'm afraid Dylan should stay here until we know... what's causing these episodes.
I'm sure you understand.
Good.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go home and get Rex right now.
You know that home isn't far from here, right?
Right across the freeway.
That's right.
I won't be gone long... and Julie's gonna stay here with you.
Yeah, you bet.
Hurry up, please. I'm sleepy.
I promise. Cross my heart.
But, Dylan... until Mommy gets back... whatever you do... don't fall asleep.
Julie, don't let him out of your sight.
What's going on?
Your hair's turning grey.
Julie, keep him awake.
Understand?
Excuse me, miss.
Would you come with us?
What? Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off me!
Do you mind?
What the hell is this?
Just a quick word... for Dylan's sake.
We've had an ex citing day, haven't we?
This one?
Right there.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
You won.
Would you mind stepping outside for one moment?
As a matter of fact, I would.
What are you doing?
It's just a little shot to see that he sleeps.
No. His mother specifically said...
- I said no.
- Do it.
All done.
He'll be asleep soon.
- Would you let go of my arm?
- You bitch!
Hey, you can't do that!
I know what's in that one.
Do you know what's in this one?
Or what's gonna happen to you when I stick you with it?
And I will.
I want you to stay awake, OK?
Keep your eyes open for me.
Come on.
Has there been any use of recreational drugs... in your family?
Or any history of mental disturbance?
What are you asking?
Please, don't take it wrong.
If there was, there's a good chance...
Dylan could be suffering from something passed down to him.
Have you been suffering from any delusional events?
This man from your films...
Freddy Krueger.
Have you been seeing him?
Would you get those keys down here?
I want you to stay awake.
Keep your eyes open for me.
Where's Mommy?
She'll be back. Now stay awake.
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.
We could... put Dylan in foster care for a short while.
Just long enough to run some tests on you.
Keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, OK?
Come on. You can stay awake.
Stay awake for me.
I want you to stay awake.
Keep your eyes open.
Dylan, what's the matter?
Julie, behind you.
There's nothing there.
Dylan, what's wrong?
Dylan, stop it.
You're scaring me.
I want my son out of here right now.
Very well.
As soon as we can gather the appropriate papers.
You don't understand.
If Dylan falls asleep, then...
I got it.
Dylan, get out of here!
Ever play skin the cat?
Come on.
Help me.
Mom!
Rex!
What the hell's going on?
You can't go in there. No.
Wait, wait.
Code yellow to paediatric testing.
Where's my son?!
Where is he?!
Have you seen my son?
He was just here.
The boy.
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
- What?
- He sleepwalks, you idiot.
He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.
Oh, shit.
John, it's Heather.
I need your help.
Why? What happened?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.
I don't know if he's wandering or headed for the house... but I think Freddy's after him.
I know that sounds crazy, but... you're right. That sounds crazy.
Oh, my God.
You know that home isn't far from here, right?
Right across the freeway.
Krueger, you bastard!
Take me!
Are you OK?
You OK?
My son is out here!
Let me go! Dylan!
I'm sorry. What happened to you?
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?
Take it easy, take it easy.
Relax. He's right there.
What happened?
Oh, God.
What's going on, Heather?
What in the world happened?
I know how Chase really died.
- What do you mean?
- Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah. Sure.
You saw him, didn't you?
Coming for you
Nancy, let's go outside.
He'll be all right.
I'll be right back.
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?
Why are you calling me Nancy,
John?
Why are you calling me John?
Nancy, pull yourself together... before you make yourself and that kid nuts.
Would you call Robert?
Robert Englund.
- The guy who plays Freddy.
- Freddy who?
Freddy Krueger.
Nancy, Freddy's dead.
Don't start losing it like your mother did.
I love you, sweetheart.
Don't forget that.
I love you, too...
Daddy.
Get yourself some rest,
Nancy, please.
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Who's there?
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.
I'm gonna get the guy who did it... and I want you to arrest him when I bring him out, OK?
Nancy, just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.
Yeah, sure.
Dylan's sleeping pills.
Say how they find their way back home.
It's important.
Breadcrumbs.
Too late, Heather.
Too late.
Join you.
You've given me a way to join you.
Almost there.
"The more she read, the more she realized...
"what she had in her hands was nothing more or less...
"than her life itself.
"That everything she had experienced and thought...
"was bound within these pages."
"There was no movie.
"There was only... her life."
It's just me.
Are you OK? Are you all right?
Where's the man?
I don't know.
He had me, but then he let me go.
Meet your maker.
Pick a pet for the rugrat, bitch.
Fuck you!
Get over there, Dylan!
Take this!
Come here, my piggy.
I got some gingerbread for you.
Gotcha!
Where's your mommy, piglet, huh, huh?
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Come to papa.
Gonna eat you up.
Leave him alone!
Dylan, get out of there!
Push!
Run!
Are you OK?
Honey, honey.
Oh, my God.
We're saved. The witch is dead.
And his mother covered him with kisses, and they were safe.
"Heather...
"thanks for having the guts to play Nancy one last time.
"At last Freddy's back where he belongs.
"Regards, Wes."
Is it a story?
Yeah. It's a story.
Read me some.
"We open on an old wooden bench.
"There's fire and tools...
"and a man's grimy hands...
"building what soon is revealed as a gleaming set of claws.
"And the claws are moving now...
"as if awakening from a long and unwanted sleep.
"Then the man lays one trembling hand flat upon the table...
"and with his other picks up a thick, sharp blade.
"Behind the lights, faces watch from the darkness...
"ready to laugh or scream in terror."
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a
Powell Pay-Per-View... television event!
It's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for the grand old Atlantic City Arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall... before it is gutted and completely renovated... as part of Gilbert Powell's
Millennium Hotel and Casino.
I'm eager to go ringside along with 14,000 fight fans... who have braved
Hurricane Jezebel to..
Cut! Cut!
Anthea, they want you to call it a tropical storm, not a hurricane.
But it is a hurricane.
Yeah, well, it's also a holiday weekend, so will you please just call it a tropical storm, please?
I love this town.
They even spin the weather.
All right, listen. We gotta go live on this one, so don't screw it up.
And Al, I think that's Powell going in there with Secretary Kirkland.
Zoom in on them during the intro.
Anyway, why can't I do this from inside?
All right, we're rolling.
Why do I have to stand out here like a...
Five, four, three,
- a weather bimbo?
- Two, one, go!
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a
Powell Pay-Per-View... television event.
Well, the lucky ones are already inside at the fight... as the first taste of Tropical Storm Jezebel... lashes the boardwalk outside the grand old Atlantic City Arena.
It's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for this storied hall.
The final event to be held here before it is gutted..
What do we got?
Thirty, forty seconds?
Where's Janine?
My hair looks like shit?
I'm on TV? I'm on TV?
Come on, for Christ's sake.
I'm on in 30 seconds. Will ya?
I think people would vote for this face. Don't you?
Yeah, blind people.
That's the only way you get anywhere these days.
You gotta get your big, fat smile all over the tube.
Hi. Rick Santoro.
Hello. Richard Santoro.
I'm Ricky!
Hey, you down on the fight yet?
Oh, shit. I forgot.
You seen Jimmy George?
Yeah, he's down in the tunnel.
What tunnel? There's a million tunnels.
I don't know. The tunnel of love, over by Tyler's dressing room.
- Here, lay 50 for me.
- On who?
On who? On the bag of meat, on who! On Tyler!
The whole 50?
Oh, up yours, Mr High Roller...
I mean, why don't you just shoot it all?
A hundred.
For his work with troubled youth, take on the challenger,
Jose Pacifico Ruiz... in a classic 12-round confrontation...
Rolling in five, between a counterpuncher and a brawler.
Four, three, two, one.
Hello? Hey, baby. How are you?
I was hoping it'd be you. Yeah.
Happy almost birthday.
Of course I'm still coming.
I'm gonna be there when it turns midnight.
Oh, yes, yes, I'm bringing something with me.
It's a surprise.
Well, if I told you, then..
That's right, baby.
No. No way.
I'm not gonna give you a hint.
No.. Shameless.
Monique, you can't say that on a cel phone.
Yummy. All right,
I will give you a hint.
I know you really want one, and... it's going to keep you very, very warm.
Give me five secs.
I'll call you back.
Jimmy George, wait up a sec.
Come on, Rick. I got people waiting for me.
Hey, that's Tyler!
- What're you lookin' at?
- That's Tyler!
Where d'you think you're goin'?
The A.C. executioner is standing right in front of me.
Were you talkin' to him?
Hey, do I ask what you do at work?
No shit. The man bets on his own fights. Now that's confidence.
- Come on, what do you want, Rick?
- What's up your ass?
- I'm havin' a bad day, okay?
- I want five large on Tyler.
Five large? You got it on you? Let me see it.
What are you, a bank now?
I gotta put up front for the privilege... of betting on a lousy fight?
Yes, you do. Take it or leave it, because I don't need the aggravation...
Have I ever stiffed you one time, Jimmy? Name one time.
No, no, you never stiffed me.
It's just that you take forever to pay.
All right.
Five grand. I'll see that a year from next Christmas.
The guy is ten-to-one to win, all right? I can't make any money if I lay less than that.
I got a very... very important birthday.
I wanna buy one of those... shorty fur coats they got at the designer shops over at Caesar's.
You know how overpriced they are.
Listen, I missed the part where any of this is my problem.
I made a promise, Jimmy.
I gave my word to someone.
A man's word means nothing... to you, in your profession? Please. Come on.
Cash means something to me.
Words mean something to somebody else...
All right. Don't move.
I'll be right back.
- Cyrus!
- Hey. Hey! Hey!
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!
Hey, hold it, pal.
Where do you think you're goin'?
- On the job, sport.
- Oh, shit. Sorry, sir.
- You need a hand?
- On, no, no. I got it.
Shit!
You kinda went the stupid way, didn't you, Cyrus?
I got a cut. I need a medic.
Medic. Medic. Medic. Medic.
Well, that's a start.
What? Wh-Wh-What do you want?
- What do you think?
- No!
Yes!
Now, come on, this is not fair. Man, come on!
Call a cop.
- Hey!
- No! Get outta here, man!
You got the wrong attitude about all... of this, Cyrus. You gotta keep positive.
See, when we have these little visits,
I allow you, I permit you,
I give you the opportunity... to pay for all the extra police work that you create.
Now, doesn't it feel nice... to contribute to society for a change?
Come on! Don't do that!
Oh, come on!
You got a bad attitude, you hear, my friend?
What makes you think you're better than me?
Friends, Cyrus.
Everybody loves Rick Santoro.
Jimmy George!
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!
Three grand on Tyler.
This one's a little sticky...
- 2900. I don't want this one.
- Why?
- There's blood all over it.
- Well, aren't you delicate.
Tyler! Neptune High, right?
Check it out, right here!
Go, Sea Devils!
You and me, Tyler!
Yeah! Go, Tyler!
Get lost.
Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler! Go!
Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler!
Go, Tyler!
Lincoln Tyler! Lincoln Tyler!
Lincoln!
- My lucky number seven.
- That's a new one, mister.
You are sunshine on a stormy day.
You should work in the casino.
- I'm gonna. I mean, I wanna.
- Yeah?
- This is just sort of temporary.
- Let me make a few phone calls.
Would you?
Yeah. Do you know how to deal blackjack?
- No.
- All right. Call me. I'm Rick.
This goes straight to my special phone line.
- Bye, mister. Bye!
- Hello?
Oh, yeah. No, hi, babe.
No, I just had something stuck in my throat.
Well, tell him to go to sleep.
I'll talk to him in the morning.
No, I can't.
That's why. All right, tell him I... love him and I'll...
No, Angela, don't...
Hi, Mikey. I know.
No, I didn't forget.
I haven't seen him yet, but as soon as I do, I'll ask him, all right?
All right. I love you too.
No, no, don't put Mommy...
Hi. I don't know. Late.
Later than that. Later than that.
Yeah, sure, if they're open.
With extra cheese?
I don't care. I don't care!
I'm not gonna eat it!
Pepperoni, sausage,
Canadian bacon...
Listen, why don't you just get the deluxe and save time, all right?
Look, I got business.
Call me back in five. There he is!
- You got a pass, sir?
- It's all right. He's with me.
- There's the man whose life I want!
- You're late.
You know me. Always upholding justice.
When did you get in?
Last night. I flew in from Norfolk with Powell and the secretary.
Hey, is that him?
Tuck in your shirt and
I'll introduce you.
Jesus! I get you a front row seat, and you show up lookin' like Don Ho.
Well, pardon my savoir faire,
Admiral. Why are you so uptight? It's fight night!
I'm runnin' security tonight.
I got a lot on my mind.
Kirkland's high profile.
He's all over the news... and brings the nutcases out of the woodwork.
He's a real publicity hound.
Look at this.
And now, the distinguished secretary of defense... of the United States of America,
Mr Charles Kirkland.
And seated next to him is a man that needs no introduction.
Great idea. Put a flashing light on your head while you're at it.
Your host for the evening,
Mr Gilbert Powell!
Maintain focus on the principal, mister.
Sorry, Commander.
- Got your locator on?
- Yes, sir.
- Go cover the west exit.
- Yes, sir.
And throw in a couple martinis while you're at it.
- It's fight night.
- Look. See that blip? That's him.
Look at you, 007.
Man, I'm so impressed.
I wanna get your autograph or somethin'.
I can picture us like yesterday, workin' summers on the beach, carrying the oars back across the hot sand.
No, me I can picture carrying the oars.
You were usually under the boardwalk... with a cute piece of jailbait.
It's me, your lucky number!
Listen, I gotta hit you up for something.
Mikey's crazy about... submarines right now. I mean, everything's submarines with him, and he wanted me to ask you if you'd get him a ride on one.
Well, sure, Rick. We'll dock the Polaris... right out at the steel pier.
Come on. This is the kind... of thing godfathers do. Come with us.
I promise I won't embarrass the brass.
I haven't been on the water... since the Renville, but I'll pull some strings for Michael.
- How's Angela?
- Fat, fantastic. I love her.
What about the other one?
What's her name? Candy?
Monique. Skinny, mean, expensive.
I love her.
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Come on.
Yeah! Look at... Yeah, baby!
Go, baby! Yeah!
You got a wife, a kid, a house in Margate, a girlfriend and an apartment.
Bein' a cop pays six figures now?
I save coupons.
Are you my conscience?
You could use one.
Does Angela know about Monique?
See, now there's a good idea. What are... you gonna do, turn me in again?
That was just to teach you a lesson.
You never shoplifted again, did you?
No, I never got caught again.
Angela's happy, trust me.
Angela's not happy.
She's just uninformed.
Maybe if she knew... the rules, she could play the game too.
Listen, if Angela knew the rules, there would be no game.
Rule number one:
Angela can't know all the rules.
Look, I'm not like you,
Kevin. I can't have sex with the same woman for 20 years.
It's not natural.
Terry likes to talk to me during sex.
Last night, she called me from a hotel.
Go, Lincoln!
Does that seem right to you?
Kevin, that is right in so many ways.
No, I mean, who's she with?
Not the guy next to her.
Beautiful woman alone at a fight.
Sexy lady. What's the problem?
You've gotta get outta this town.
You know that, don't you?
Would you stop going... all Jiminy Cricket on me. You can't help yourself, can you?
No, really. I mean, get your butt down to D.C.
I call a few guys I know from Annapolis, arrange some interviews, get you a G.S. rating, you're in our programme.
Bureau of Diplomatic Security... pays double what your salary is here, and the money's clean.
All right, all right. You gotta fix my life later. I got money on this.
I wanna stay in a good mood.
You know, keep positive.
Because this is fight night!
Don't make Michael grow up here.
This isn't a beach town any more. It's a sewer.
But it's my sewer, Jiminy, and I love it.
I kick around about six square blocks.
Everybody knows me.
I got the whole town wired. Someday if I... manage to get my face on TV a few times, maybe I'll run for mayor or something, but that's as far as I want to go.
Because I was made for this sewer, baby, and I am the king!
He's taunting the champ mercilessly.
I haven't seen this kind of disrespect... shown to a heavyweight champion in the ring since...
Would you stop playing and fight!
- Buster Douglas.
- Buster Douglas, exactly.
The condition he's in, sooner or later...
Look at Ruiz dance around!
The crowd is loving it!
She's not watching the fight.
- Or hating it.
- Or hating it. Exactly.
What they came to see... tonight was a professional heavyweight championship fight, and that is not what they're getting, and you better believe they are letting... these fighters know it.
You know,
I seriously wonder just how seriously... the champ is taking this fight.
The champ has shown up here tonight... in the worst condition of his career.
Yeah, I've got to agree with you.
There was a lot of speculation about the condition he was in.
Hello? Hey, baby, kind of a bad time right now.
What? All right.
Guess quick, okay?
All right. The hint was, you really want it and it'll keep you warm.
No, Monique, it's not that.
I mean, I had that. It goes where I go. You know what I..
Hang on. Wha... Oh, Jesus, Angela!
The fight's starting.
What? The deluxe has meatballs, baby!
All right, I gotta go.
The fight's starting.
Listen, I gotta go.
The fight's starting.
Hey, I dig affection, baby, but not while I'm driving.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That seat's taken.
But you can sit here.
- Well, I'll just need one minute.
- Me too.
- It's in the pocket.
- Have you been writing to me?
Yeah, go Sea Devils!
Holy cow!
The challenger is down! Ruiz is down!
What a punch by Lincoln Tyler!
Ruiz was pushing it! He was..
He head-butted!
He head-butted!
It's a head-butt!
Here comes the pain, baby!
He must not...
Didn't he see that?
Here comes the pain!
This is a potentially devastating blow to the champ.
I can't see if it's opened up a cut over his eye or not.
We saw it in the
Holyfield-Tyson match, and we see it here.
You're a bum, Lincoln Tyler!
How can you...
He's down!
Listen to me, Mr Secretary.
I am telling you, you are the one that's gonna be sorry.
Get back! Neutral corner.
Hello. What?
Who are you? Where?
My lucky number?
What?
Principal is down.
Hey!
Kevin! Kevin, he's down!
The man is down!
Get outta here!
Oh, yeah? Screw you, man!
Tommy, get this scum out of here!
Oh, Jesus.
There were two hits.
The girl next to me, she threatened him, took something, got shot and ran away.
- Oh, my God!
- Shut down the arena.
Shit. Is he dead?
Get on your goddam radio and shut down the arena!
- Hey, be careful!
- Let go of me!
- What happened to you?
- Would you please ju...
- What's going on? Come back here!
- Let go of me!
Let's get this gurney up!
Let's go!
Come on, make a hole through there!
Get that crowd outta the way!
Come on! Tell him to bring... that ambulance through the main entrance into the arena tunnel!
You're gonna be all right.
You are gonna be all right, Charles.
You're going to the hospital... right now. You're gonna be okay. You have my word on that.
Come on, come on!
Get those people... outta the tunnel! Move it, there!
He's gonna die, Rick.
This is my fault.
I should never have left my seat.
I opened up a sight line.
I was off the deck. What the hell was I doing? This is my fault!
What the hell is the matter... with you? Don't talk shit like that where people can hear.
You don't understand.
I pulled rank on regular detail and took command of security.
I told them the secretary... would be better protected with me running the operation, because I know the area, the layout of... the arena and the local law enforcement.
I get assigned, I step... out of position, the secretary takes a bullet in the throat.
Why were you out of position?
I should never have left him.
I could be court-martialled!
That is not gonna happen!
We're not gonna let that happen. Do you understand?
You are not going to prison, so you just forget about that!
All right, back up.
Why were you out of position?
The girl... the redhead...
I went over to check her out.
She ran, and
I followed her up here.
Don't say 'redhead' and don't say
'girl'. Say 'suspicious character'.
You followed a suspicious character, and when you got up here, you saw an assassin fire, so you took him out, end of story.
Rick, leaving my post is dereliction of duty. It's gross negligence.
You killed the assassin!
You saved the day!
You're a hero, Kevin. That's what... happened, and that's how we'll spin it.
- It wasn't procedure.
- Screw procedure!
Look, who do you think you're talking to?
I'm not some beat cop that needs you to plant a piece for him.
Kevin, if there's one thing I know, it's how to cover my ass.
I see this shit happen every day.
What you say and do right this minute... is gonna change the rest of your life.
Go to confession later, but don't bury yourself now!
Clear it out! Comin' through.
Those are state cops.
They're gaming enforcement.
They're gonna try and muscle us, but we're not gonna let that happen.
If we're first contact when the feds get... here, everybody writes from our report, and your story holds up because we say so.
We just gotta keep all the media outta here till then.
How long will it take the feds to get here?
No comment.
This is an active investigation.
FBI's gotta come from Trenton, so that's an hour, maybe an hour and a half with the storm.
So we just gotta fight these... guys for an hour and a half, and you're in the clear, okay?
- I can't lie, Rick.
- It isn't lying!
You just tell 'em what you did right, and you leave out the rest!
Shouldn't even be here.
This is a crime scene.
Or you can throw away your whole career.
Gordon Pritzker,
Division of Gaming Enforcement.
What the hell is going on here?
187 with an officer-involved shooting.
Secretary Kirkland was shot in the neck.
Paramedics just wheeled him out, and that's the perpetrator.
Security detail leader took him out during the shooting.
That's right.
Commander Kevin Dunne.
I'm with D.O.D.
- Who are you?
- Atlantic City, Major Crimes.
- I'll take it now.
- No, bullshit you will.
This isn't my blood, all right?
It's the secretary's. I was sitting right in front of him.
I'm a homicide detective... and a material witness. This is mine about six different ways!
A.C. cops got no business in the casino.
This is strictly D.G.E. and state police.
We're not on the casino floor,
Gordo! And this arena ain't the Millennium yet!
It's Atlantic City, New Jersey, and that belongs to me!
I'm acting case agent until relieved by appropriate federal authority!
Now, you want to help, you go tell your men to get all the media outta here right now!
Unless you want the 9:00 news... to give the secretary's wife and kids... a close-up look at his internal organs.
Phil, Jim, make this whole arena a crime scene. Shut it down.
Nobody goes in or out till... the main investigating party gets here.
You're the one who told them to seal the doors?
You can't hold 14,000 people in these goddam exit tunnels!
Yes, we did, and yes, we can.
Those are 14,000 eyewitnesses!
Excuse me...
We can just take as long as it takes... to get 14,000 addresses and 14,000 phone numbers... and take 14,000 pictures, now that I think about it.
Let's get the hell outta here.
You're home free, baby.
All right.
The woman who ran away...
You said, she... she took something. What was it?
It was in a manila envelope about this big.
What did she look like?
Caucasian, late 20's, dressed in white, blood everywhere.
She had a blonde wig, dark hair underneath.
All right. You stay here with every uniform you can get.
I'll run a top-to-bottom and find her.
You guys, come with me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Commander Dunne, sir?
Could you give us the identity of the assassin, please?
- Sir, how does it feel to be a hero?
- Hey, you, get outta here.
We told you never to talk to the people... here. No press in the arena.
I said no press inside the arena, Lou.
Not in the arena!
Hey, I could see why you want these other assholes outta here, but I didn't think you were talking about me too!
You know what kind of break this is for me?
You can't show this.
Look at the mess on the floor.
The guy's got a family. Have a heart, for Christ's sakes.
All right. I won't shoot the spaghetti, then.
Come on. Whenever they make statements, they always have one pool reporter asking all the questions.
That's the way they do it.
Come on. Let me be the guy.
Have you got the playback for the pay-per-view up there?
Yeah, right up here.
Look, you don't know what this would mean to me, Rick.
You think I want to do... this, this pay-per-view shit for the rest of my life?
Do you know how Rather got his break?
The goddam Kennedy assassination!
You make me sick, Lou.
Hey, if you're gonna be on TV, who better asking you the questions... than your old pal Lou?
Plus, I can have two grand cash in an hour and a half.
You are a disgusting human being.
Hey, five grand in an hour.
Congratulations,
Lou. You're the guy!
Yes!
Hook up out in the hallway. I don't want to see one TV camera inside.
- Right.
- This whole arena's a crime scene.
Hey, Rick, I gotta tell you, I will always be there for you, my friend.
Oh, yeah. See if you can find me another shirt if I'm going on TV.
I don't wanna look like this.
Gotta be, you know, classy like you, Lou.
Yeah.
And... Yeah.
Here's your hundred back.
All bets are off.
Secretary of defense gets his head blown off, and you want to look at the knockout punch.
Back up.
Stop.
How many cameras do you have on it?
- I got four.
- All right. Let me see 'em all.
I'll be damned.
Air ball. What kind of a Sea Devil is that?
Oh, God. What did you get yourself into?
Look here. Mr Tyler, he ain't in the mood to talk to nobody.
You see where your hand is?
That's a felony.
Give me a 'C'! Give me an 'H'!
Give me an 'A-M-P'!
What's that spell?
Everybody! Champ.
Lincoln, how ya doin'?
Good to see you again.
- What, am I supposed to know you?
- Rick Santoro.
Neptune High.
Fellow Sea Devil. Class of '80.
I don't remember you.
Come on. You must have seen me play.
My hair was long then, but whose wasn't, right?
- Mr Santoro.
- Detective. Detective Santoro.
Now, I know it might be a bad time, but could I get you to sign an autograph for my son?
He thinks you're the greatest, just the greatest.
'To Mikey'.
I bet if you saw my graduation picture, the face would ring a bell.
Look, I don't know you, okay?
Lincoln, you hurt my feelings, and after I dropped ten grand on you.
You know what? I think it would show more respect... if you address my client as Mr Tyler.
I'll call him Mr 'T'! The night he beat Rocky Balboa, if he wants.
He's a bad pony.
I don't have to tell you, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I saw Jimmy George.
You know, the bookie.
He was coming out of here before the fight.
How much did you lose?
Or did you win?
Know what I mean?
- Wasn't his night...
- I'll say.
Hey, look. The guy was a great fighter.
He fought very furiously.
You know, you've never been knocked out your whole career.
I mean, ever! Since your first
Golden Gloves in what, '82?
I'd know.
I've seen all your fights.
What with us both being... from the same school and both being Sea Devils and all.
The man head-butted me, and
I don't remember anything after that.
Excuse me, Lincoln.
Would you drink... a glass of water or something?
You're lying so much, your mouth... dried up, and you're making that funny... that smacking sound.
Let me remind you who you're talking to, hot shot.
Lincoln Tyler is a significant public figure.
He's a goddam pillar of this community.
Let's keep that in mind, or this little interview that we're having here is over.
Look, the guy... the secretary... he's dead, isn't he?
Lincoln, Lincoln.
If you have a question, let me ask it for you.
Look, Mickey!
I just want to know if the guy is dead.
Is he dead?
The smart money ain't on him.
That's it. That is it.
Do you know who you reminded me... of out there? Sonny Liston!
Remember in '65, they said,
'Hey, Sonny, don't take any chances.
'Ali almost killed you the first time.
Take the payday.
First punch, you go down'.
Flop. Splat. That's you!
That's you!
Detective, either arrest him or leave.
What would I arrest him for?
What would I arrest you for?
- Getting up too quick?
- What?
What? Come on.
I saw you, and you saw me.
Don't pretend like you don't know who I am, girlie man.
You wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
Totally understandable reaction, but it ruined the performance, don't you think?
What the hell do you want?
The man knocked me out!
I looked at the fight tape,
Lincoln! Yeah!
It was a phantom punch!
A little bad Hollywood acting, but the athletic commission might find it interesting.
And a second after you go down, an assassin fires.
Well, that's some coincidence!
I guess they don't call you the 'Executioner' for nothing!
And you sign my kid's autograph!
All right, that's it.
Everybody get out.
- Listen to me. This guy's a snake.
- Mickey!
What don't you understand about this?
Get the hell outta here!
Go on, get out!
His name?
Michael Santoro.
This is a crime scene.
In order to exit the arena, we must see an authentic picture I. D.
If you cannot produce one, you must step to the left... where the officer will take your photograph... and record your name and address.
I'll say this one more time.
No one, with no exceptions, will be allowed to exit the arena... until your identity has been recorded.
Everyone's cooperation will be greatly appreciated.
Watch your step.
Hey, hey, hey! I said no press in the arena, goddam it!
Move to the right.
Clear the way.
That punk fights like a bitch.
He got no snap in his punches. He swings... with his arm, no shoulder muscles.
You threw the fight.
If I say yes, can we cut some kind of deal?
You don't need a deal.
I'm not gonna say anything to anybody.
You pay me back the ten grand I lost, plus $500 for shaming the ring, and I forgive you.
What'd you do it for?
You can't need the money.
You gotta be worth millions.
They didn't tell me they were gonna kill somebody.
Who?
Who didn't tell you?
Look, man. See, you just don't understand.
I just gave away the one thing
I know that makes me me.
The heavyweight championship.
Now that I don't even have that,
I don't even know who I am any more.
What did they have on you?
- Get 'em outta here, Cyrus.
- Yo! Pay-per-view?
Oh, man, great shot, buddy. Yeah, great shot. Great shot. Terrific.
Come on, take a hike, okay?
This is so good.
There's cameras everywhere, for Christ's sake.
What about if the guy from... the commission comes in here, he wants to check your gloves.
What are you gonna do, retire and live on your savings?
What savings? You gotta have this... freak show here tonight of all nights.
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.
Come here, Mickey!
Forget about it, Cyrus.
- Come on!
- I did not go to law school for this.
- Mickey, I can't...
- What? Keep your shirt on, Cyrus.
Come on, Mickey.
I'm trying to do this here.
- Four, right?
- No, no, no, no.
- Four, Mickey!
- I said three. The deal was three.
- Four!
- Hey, Mick.
- What do you want?
- Just a second. Give me 35.
- I got a quick question.
- Take a hike.
Come on, man!
I'm gonna get you later. Get outta here.
I'm gettin' a lot of bets... very large bets against Lincoln, that is.
I'm just wondering what the fuck is going on.
Would you please lower your voice?
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
It's just everybody knows
Lincoln likes the action, right?
I mean, what I'm saying is
Lincoln likes to gamble, right?
It's not exactly a secret.
Never on boxing. I've been through all this shit with the commission.
- I do not have to explain it to you.
- I know about the commission.
Never on boxing.
You're right. Yeah, that's right, okay?
He's in pretty heavy at some of the casinos, isn't he?
And some people are saying that... maybe he's looking to clean up the books a little.
Maybe Lincoln's decided tonight's not his night.
You actually come to tell him there's... a lot of action against him?
Then you have the nerve to accuse him of what?
You know what I'm saying.
I've never been this offended in my life.
I want you to tell Lincoln what you... just said to me.
Come on. Hey, Lincoln?
Jimmy's got something really... interesting to tell you. Listen to this.
Go on, tell him.
Forget it. Forget everything I said.
- Come on. Listen.
- Knock him dead, champ.
Jimmy George, wait up a second.
Hey, come on, Rick.
I got people waiting for me.
Hey. Hey. Hey!
That's Tyler!
Hey, what are you looking at? Go buy a ticket.
You are never gonna get away with this.
- Get out of my face, Mickey.
- Look at me!
- No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Look at yourself!
Bleed, Mickey! Bleed!
You taught me that.
Remember?
No, no. No way, man.
You got yourself into this.
You get caught, you lose my phone number.
I told you, you can't live like you do.
You make yourself vulnerable.
Everybody wants a piece of you.
- Well, look at this, man.
- They got all of you now.
That's beautiful. That is...
That's terrif... That's great.
- That's great. Jesus Christ!
- Mickey?
Yeah? Cyrus, here.
Come on, Mickey. I got bills to pay.
- Take that and get lost.
- Best of the best, right, Mr Tyler?
Come on, get outta here. Move along.
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!
Tyler!
Tyler! Ty...
Words mean something to somebody else...
All right, don't move.
- I'll be right back. Cyrus! Cyrus!
- Yo, yo.
- Cyrus!
- Yo!
How much were you into the casinos for?
Enough.
The people that set this up said if I dropped this one, they'd square everything I owed.
Plus, if I lose to an underdog, it would set me up for a rematch, and the rematch is where the real money is.
They didn't say what round they wanted it in.
They were gonna let me know during the... fight. There was a guy in the front row.
They told me what he was gonna say, and... he was gonna be the signal to go down.
I ain't never gonna forget those words:
'Here comes the pain'.
It was all I could do to keep from taking him out. Just one punch.
Shove that radio right through the side of his head.
- Radio?
- Yeah.
He had one of those things in his ear.
Anyway, the fight started.
Come on, man. Come on, old man.
Let's see what you got, old man.
I couldn't get that sack of shit to take a decent swing at me.
Is that all you got?
He wouldn't stop talking, like he was gonna bullshit me to death.
Gotta do better than that.
Come on, baby!
Come on, now!
You're too slow, old man. Come on!
What you gonna do to me?
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah!
Come on, baby! Come on!
Come on! Let's see what you got!
Let me see what you got, old man.
Come on, bring it to me.
Come on! Come on! Yeah!
Yeah, I'm right here.
I'm right here.
What are you trying to do... with that stuff you got?
Come on. You're too slow!
I was just trying to shut him up.
I barely even tapped him, and I almost won the fight.
Go, Sea Devils!
One, two... three, four... five... six... seven... eight...
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Get it on!
You punch like a bitch!
This is a fight! Get...
And he did head-butt me.
I wasn't lying about that.
Everything went wrong. It was like he was trying to screw up the deal.
- I'll stop the fight.
- No!
- Right after that, I got the signal.
- Are you all right?
- Are you sure?
- It was quicker than I thought.
- Maybe they were getting nervous.
- Let's get it on.
Here comes the pain, baby!
Here comes the pain!
- Here comes the pain!
- I showed you what it's about!
I wasn't supposed to go down right away.
They were very clear about that.
I had to take a punch, fall... back into the corner, let him charge in and knock me out... because they wanted everybody up on their feet, distracted, giving him a clear shot right through the count.
But that punkass son of a bitch didn't sweep through the punch, and I was so far into the act in my own head, you know, by the time I realized he didn't... connect, I was already in the corner.
You're a bum, Tyler!
How could you do this to me?
He's a bum!
Get back! Neutral corners.
Get back! Stay there!
One... two... three... four..
But nobody was supposed to die.
She never said anything about that.
She? She?
You hear that storm out there?
I wish it would blow this whole town away.
No, no, no. Who's she?
She's the one who came to me... in the first place, told me I was supposed to go down.
- I never met anybody else but her.
- Did you get a name?
Yeah, name, address, serial... number, 8 by 10 colour picture.
You wanna look at that too?
Do you remember anything unusual about her?
- Her hair, maybe.
- What about it?
It was bright red, like it was on fire.
A Palestinian who's lived in the
United States for the last six years.
He's believed to be linked to a series of threatening letters... written to various defense secretaries... expressing outrage... over the sale of missile systems and other weaponry to lsrael.
A handwritten note was found on Rabat's body.
Would you hold that up too, please?
Apparently he intended it to be found after the shooting.
Commander, what's in the note, sir?
I can't disclose that until it's been studied by investigators.
Commander, could you give us the condition of the secretary, please?
He was taken to Atlantic City Medical Center, but, I have no other information at this time.
That's all I can say until the F.B.I. joins the investigation.
Thank you, Commander.
That was Commander Kevin Dunne.
Did you find her?
No. She might have gone into the casino.
There's a dozen service doors from here... to there. We couldn't watch all of them.
Well, double the men you have at the casino exits.
I gotta talk to you.
- What is it?
- Let's go somewhere private.
Just because a guy has something plugged... into his ear doesn't mean...
I asked.
Tyler says it was a radio.
Okay, we'll check it out.
But a compulsive gambler who admits he took a dive... might not turn out to be the best witness in the world.
It's not just him.
I'm betting the redhead is the person... who told Tyler to throw the fight.
She's one, shooter's two, Tyler's three, the drunk who shouted the signal's four, and whoever was on the other end of that radio is five.
Five people make a conspiracy, right?
Yeah, yeah. Look, anything's possible, but I gotta tell you... we got a file an inch thick on this guy Rabat.
He's a well-known nutcase. It was clear... he was ready to die for his cause.
That's a suicide note.
You know, 'l fly into the arms of Allah', shit like that.
He was all worked up about our missile sales to lsrael, and it's conceivable that he found out... about the Norfolk test.
Norfolk test? What's that?
Kevin, I know it's classified, but I am the investigating officer in a murder now.
All right. But what are you chasing this for?
You don't get out of bed unless there's an angle in it for you.
Guys get elected president... just for being in the right place at the right time.
I only want to be mayor.
Look, part of what
I'm going to tell you, it could bury me.
I hope you can keep this between us.
Kevin, you're talking to your best friend.
And loyalty's my only vice.
So what's the problem?
The problem is that
I was in too good a mood.
That trip to Norfolk was for a weapons test... for the AirGuard, Powell's new antimissile defense system.
It's light years ahead of the
Sea Sparrows our ships have now.
If we had this in the Gulf when the Renville...
After the Renville incident the old man... picked me to sell it to congress.
Everybody at D.O.D. wanted it to work, and it did. The test went beautifully.
By the time we got to the fight tonight, we were all high as kites.
I let the excitement get to me.
I lost my edge.
- Can I see your ticket, please?
- My what?
Your ticket, ma'am.
I need to see your ticket for this seat.
My ticket. Yeah, sure.
I think I have it here.
Hey!
Hold on a minute.
I was talking to you back there.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Is that okay with you?
In the middle of the first round?
You're not much of a fight fan, I guess.
Look Sarge,
I don't know who you are, but you have no right to hassle me like this.
I get paid... to hassle people. Show me your ticket, or I'll have you escorted out.
Okay, okay. I don't have a ticket.
I mean, I have a ticket, but it's way up there in the nosebleed seats... and I couldn't see a thing, so...
Listen, I do this all the time.
They always let me get away with it.
- Come on. It's no big deal.
- It is tonight.
- What's so special about tonight?
- Very important man in the crowd.
And you're, what, his bodyguard?
That must be a very exciting job.
Yeah, it's got its moments.
I was three feet away from a known terrorist, and I had my eyes buried in some broad's tits.
Well, Kevin, this might not make you... feel better, but don't you see?
That's what she was there for.
That was the plan.
To give you a boner.
And you got one.
- Congratulations. You're human.
- Come on, Rick.
Look on the bright side. I like you better. Golden boy screwed up.
Wait a minute. We need to be very, very careful with this.
We go out there and yell conspiracy, it's like waving a lunatic flag.
We gotta get our hands on the redhead... or the guy that shouted the signal.
If they're still in the building.
And the woman who was talking to the secretary.
I'll stay after her, and you find the other two.
No, no. This is wrong.
We're never gonna find anything just walking around the arena.
What if they've gone into the casino?
I'm going up to surveillance.
They've got cameras all over the place.
Just bitchin' technology.
All right, you do that while I check with... security, see if they found anything.
Well, I finally understand... why you didn't want me to worry about your shooter.
One less terrorist in the world.
At least he did something productive on his way out.
Did he know he was on a suicide mission?
He does now.
With all due respect, sir, we should... have been out of here 11 minutes ago.
Things have changed.
We need to make an adjustment.
A local cop made both of you.
- What?
- Made us? How?
It's not important. He's searching the building for you right now.
So what do we do? Take him out?
- That's not an option.
- It's the only option.
Negative. Not with this guy.
- Let's move out.
- Yes, sir.
You do have a contingency plan, don't you, sir?
- Yes, but I don't like it.
- Why not?
Because a soldier deserves better.
Jesus Christ!
Wait. I've been shot.
I've been shot.
- I'm shot.
- I'm sorry.
We got 1,500 cameras...
800 on the casino side,
720 on the hotel side, quadruple redundancy on the gaming floor.
If they're down there, we'll find them.
I appreciate it, Walt.
No problem. You think one of these... people's your shooter?
- We already got the shooter.
- Then, what are you looking for?
- Where do we start?
- You tell me.
- Lobby.
- Can you go to the right?
Keep moving.
Let's go by section.
Keep going.
No.
Hey, C.J., punch up 383, the guy in the checkered shirt.
What about him?
Coin cup grabber.
Look. Watch the money.
You know him?
Nah, you just get to read body language.
There he goes. There he goes.
See, somebody wants to play the slots, they're staring at the machines trying... to guess which one's lucky.
Grabber could care less.
He checks out the people.
He's like a pickpocket, only crude, you know? No skills.
- Keep going?
- Keep going.
The identity of the assassin is Tarik ben Rabat.
Thirty-seven years old.
A Palestinian... who's lived in the United States for the last six years.
Oh, my God.
He's believed to be linked to a series of threatening...
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You down on the race?
Yeah.
Me too.
Yeah.
We got two men covering every casino exit door.
Nobody's seen her yet.
Keep 'em there. We'll search the floor section by section.
You are hot.
So, you wanna come back to my room... and have a little fun together?
Best idea...
Who's... who's winning?
Looks like the number four horse, Daddy's Hobby.
Yeah?
God, I'm hot.
Do you have air conditioning?
- In your room, air conditioning.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?
- I keep it turned down real low.
What you want?
I need a word with Mr Tyler.
I want to apologize, sir, for not securing the infra-reds.
The shooter missed the girl.
There was nothing you could do.
Walter, I think we got another hooker... in the Princess Lounge.
- Punch up 596.
- Excuse me a second.
She hasn't been there five minutes, she can't take her hands off him.
- Oh, my God, that's her!
- You said she had red hair.
No, somebody else.
Where's that bar?
I don't think...
Walt, they're leaving.
Don't worry, Ricky.
I'll stay with 'em.
Come on, grab a radio, stay on channel three.
- Here we go. Place your bets.
- Now.
You can't win if you don't play.
- That's her.
- We've located the girl.
- Okay.
- Come on.
- Where is she?
- Over there, by the elevators.
- I got it from here. Thanks.
- Done, sir.
I don't see her, Walt.
Walt, where is she? Walt!
You're on the opposite side of the floor.
They're playing the
'Magnificent Seven'... near the lobby elevators.
Got 'em.
Just playing the spare change.
Yeah. I... I wanna go upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah. Me too. Me too.
- Yeah. I wanna go...
Yes!
- Hey!
- I wanna go upstairs now!
Hey.
And if you don't come with me,
I'm sure somebody else will.
Change of plans.
They're at the elevators. Hang a right.
Wait a minute.
Shit!
- I missed her. Got her on the box?
- Yeah, Ricky, I got 'em.
I'm taking this elevator.
Tell me what floor they're on.
So, what kind of music do you like?
- What?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted a hug.
- What floor?
- Thirty-five. What?
- What?
- Nothing.
I just want to get upstairs.
Walt, I gotta know what floor.
I can't make out the buttons.
It's a high one.
Can you pick 'em up when they get off?
I'd have to check floor by floor. I'd lose 'em.
Hang on. I got an idea.
Come on, Walt.
Yeah, this is McGahn in Security.
Do we have a Ned Campbell staying at the hotel?
No, wait. It's going up.
Walt!
What room?
- You're a genius.
Come on. Come on.
Yeah!
Oh, my God!
Please! Come on!
The weather is more important than me, baby?
Look at me. Look at me! Yeah!
- Honey, there's a hurricane on.
- So what? I'm hot.
- Come on!
- You wanna play rough?
I'll give you a little hurricane.
I love it!
Secretary of Defence
Charles Kirkland... is in critical condition at the
Atlantic City Medical Center... after being struck by an assassin's bullet... while attending a boxing match at the Atlantic City Arena.
We've been getting live updates... from the only reporter allowed inside the arena, a Lou Logan of
Powell Pay-Per-View Television...
Could you hold it down in there?
People are trying to sleep!
We've also learned that
Rabat left a suicide note... which was found on his body... by police in the moments after the shooting took place.
Hi. I hope you don't mind.
I borrowed your shirt.
Not at all. I happen to think women... look very sexy in men's shirts.
- Okay.
- Can you...
Just hold on one minute, okay?
Oh, okay.
Oh, please!
Excuse me! You're the one... who was practically giving me the knob job down in the bar.
I'm sorry. I need a place where
I can just wait, and then I'll go.
A place where you can just wait and go.
Well, what do you think this is, a bus stop?
What, are you on drugs? I should've... figured this out.
You look like hell.
Did you come up here to rob me?
Is that what you were thinking?
Look, I'm in trouble.
Somebody shot at me, okay?
Now I've heard everything. Go.
Do you know what's going on tonight?
Have you heard?
Listen, I am a very happily married man, and I don't need your kind of trouble.
- So let's go.
- Just a half an hour.
- No, wait, please!
- Get out!
- It's all right.
- Who are you?
- Take a walk.
- What the hell's going on here?
I said take a walk!
It's my room, damn it!
Hi. Remember me?
I'm Detective Santoro.
I shoved you out of the way of that bullet.
Yeah.
Can you please help me?
I need to get out of this building.
The first thing we're gonna do is get you outta this room.
So you can calm down.
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?
Yeah.
This hotel sucks!
What's the problem?
Some guy just busted into my room.
- What guy? Where?
- Come on. I'll show ya.
There I am, minding my own business, writing a letter to my lovely wife, and some guy just busts in.
She must've gone with him.
Hey, is that a silencer?
What did he look like?
Where are we going?
What's the matter with you?
He's following me.
You're with me now.
You're safe. I'm a cop.
I'm gonna protect you and serve you.
We got a very cosy little... step here, so why don't we just sit down and calm down.
Take a deep breath.
How's your arm?
It's fine, thanks.
- You're not gonna die on me?
- No.
- We can talk for a minute?
- Yeah.
Okay.
No, thank you.
Why'd you run away from me?
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.
All right. I'm not interested in what you don't know.
What I'm interested in is what you do know. Please.
Okay.
I... I work at Powell Aircraft.
I put together the ballistics reports we issue after weapons tests.
- You're talking about missiles?
- Right.
Now, the newest missile, the AirGuard,
I've been tracking its results... for the past couple of months, and they are perfect.
These tests are never perfect, so I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know who I could trust.
I sent an anonymous E-mail to Secretary Kirkland... telling him that I suspected that these results were doctored.
He actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
Yesterday, I got it, and I told him that
I wanted to give it to him in person.
He told me to bring it to the fight tonight.
Secretary Kirkland, welcome to Atlantic City. Are you here on official business?
Not for a couple of hours.
I'm just another fight fan.
I couldn't get near him when they... first came in. Powell was all over him.
The South Jersey worker we are interested in tonight... is the Atlantic City Executioner.
So I decided to wait until the fight started.
And I had no idea... where they were sitting, so I went up top to get a better view.
All right.
Hold it, hold it. Stop right there.
This is Dunne you're talking about.
Naval uniform?
Commander Kevin Dunne?
Right.
Talking with Rabat before he shoots Kirkland?
Yeah.
I recognized him, and I'd just seen him come in.
No, then you saw wrong.
It wasn't Dunne.
He could not be a part of it.
Will you just listen to the rest?
- I'm sorry.
- That seat's taken.
But you can sit here.
- Well, I'll just need one minute.
- Me too.
It's in the pocket.
Excuse me. Did you say something?
It's in the pocket.
- Possible make.
- Pocket?
So you've been writing to me.
Just look in the envelope, Mr Secretary.
What is it?
It's the satellite infra-reds from yesterday's tests.
They gave me those.
They showed convergent impact.
They gave you doctored copies.
These are the originals from the proving ground computers.
Make is good. Stand by.
Please, just look for yourself.
- Okay.
- She has the infra-reds.
I need you to look at the heat flashes... here at the moment of impact.
If the AirGuard had made full intercept like it's supposed to,
Start the count.
Copy.
There would be one dot, but there's two every time.
The target blows up, but the AirGuard... never gets within ten metres of it.
Then why would the target blow up?
Bring on the pain, baby!
Because they rigged it, Mr Secretary.
They put on a fireworks display for you.
The AirGuard doesn't work, and the... company knows the system doesn't work, but they're pushing it through anyway.
I know what they're thinking... we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
But I am telling you, you're the one that's gonna be sorry.
Jesus Christ!
Bert Powell's out of his mind.
If you deploy that weapons system and a war breaks out...
- All right. I get the picture.
- Hello? Who?
Don't make plans for the next six months, young lady.
You're going to be sending some people to jail.
That's not what happened.
That's not what happened.
I'm sorry. I wish I didn't know any of this either.
Who the hell do you think you are, lady?
Sticking your nose in where it doesn't... belong. You're a number cruncher.
Just crunch the goddam numbers!
I was doing my job.
I mean, we were creating... a defense system that was supposed to save people's lives.
They're building the factory... in a disadvantaged part of the state.
- This was a good thing to do.
- 'This was a good thing to do'.
Jesus, somebody hands you a line, you just swallow it whole, don't you?
Just a little Goody Two-shoes.
Yeah, I believed in what we were doing, and they corrupted it.
So somebody had to speak up.
I mean, it's important.
Does it feel important now? Did it feel important when the bullet hit?
I had no choice.
I can't live with the blood of innocent soldiers on me, okay?
- Whose side are you on?
- My side.
That E-mail. You let 'em know you were coming.
They just sat back and waited for you to show your face.
No, I was careful.
I waited till Powell left.
I didn't sit down till it was clear.
No, you sat down exactly when they wanted you to.
They opened the door, and you walked on through right on cue.
They didn't miss him with... that second shot.
They missed you.
I thought I'd get fired, not... killed.
What do we do now?
Well, are you a cop or aren't you?
I can't get past the men at the doors... by myself, but with you I'd be fine.
You get me outside, you don't have to... think about me again.
- I can take care of myself.
- You've done a hell of a job so far.
Look, I'm sorry if I...
- Who gives a shit if you're sorry?
- What are you mad at me for?
Because I didn't have to know!
You decided to have this problem, not me!
My world would've gone on turning just fine, but now either way I look,
I have to do something
I don't want to do.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I do not want to do this!
Do what?
How old are you?
I'm 26.
Do you have a, a family around here?
My mother in New York.
Do you have a husband?
- No.
- Boyfriend?
Why are you asking me all this?
Kevin. Kevin Dunne.
You're positive he's the one you saw... with Rabat before the shots were fired?
Let me tell you a little something about Kevin Dunne.
You know him.
He is one of the most honourable dudes on the planet!
You know him. You know him.
Yeah, I know him. And you could be wrong. Yeah, you could.
There were people rushing in front of you, and you were nervous, and you were scared.
You could be wrong.
Isn't it possible?
Yes. Yes.
Isn't it so?
Yeah, now that I think about it, I think I could be wrong.
You remember
I told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and I couldn't quite focus.
I don't think it was him.
Shit. Your glasses didn't fall off till after the gunshots...
Nah, shit!
What happened with the girl?
A cop shoved her out of the way, and he's got her now somewhere.
The cop? You mean your cop?
Yes.
But it's all good, right, because you said he's controllable?
Absolutely.
He's only chasing this down because... he thinks it's a career opportunity.
Chasing it down, what?
You said he'd sit back.
This doesn't sound like he's sitting back.
It sounds like he's conducting... an active investigation, a very dangerous investigation.
Kirkland died ten minutes ago.
Five minutes from now,
I gotta be on TV.
Now, what is it, yes or no? We got... a goddam Columbo runnin' around loose?
No operation goes exactly as planned.
You don't panic.
Stay calm and tie up loose ends.
What do you think I've been doing for the last hour?
Jesus Christ!
This is not the plan I invested in!
In the plan I bought, that prairie populist... who was criminally dismantling... the entire armed forces, goes down!
The disloyal employee, she goes down with him.
The fanatical terrorist, he takes the rap.
The AirGuard missile contract is approved, and I... I get enough money to finish the goddam Millennium!
It was a good plan!
No humiliation, no scandal, no prison!
We're still contained.
Once the girl is gone, it's only me and two men I trust.
Two?
I thought there were four.
Do we have another acceptable loss?
I'm not on that list, am I?
- You'll be safe in here.
- Safe?
I'm giving you a place to hide.
Look, I don't wanna hide.
I wanna get out, okay?
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Take you out through the casino.
Where are you go...
Rick? Rick, the door's locked!
Rick?
Rick, let me out, please!
Rick, please, just let me out, okay?
I'll get out on my own!
Rick!
Hey, Rick!
- Yeah.
- Here.
Come on. It's the five grand for letting me be the guy.
There's something extra here.
You're all heart, Rick.
I can't believe we got called out in this rain.
Can you believe this, man?
Sir, this entire area is now the site of an F.B.I. investigation.
You have to leave. Okay.
Log in Santoro. He's A.C. Police.
Here comes the pain, baby!
Here comes the pain!
Here comes the pain!
You're a bum, Lincoln Tyler!
How could you do... He's a bum!
Man!
Hello. What?
Hi, Ricky! It's me.
I'm here, sweetie.
- Who are you? Where?
- I'm here, sweetie!
- It's me, your lucky number!
- My lucky number?
I'm here.
It's called the Zero
Gravity Flying Eye.
New camera. Got it in this morning.
So nobody knew you had it?
Well, I knew.
It's remote control.
It floated all around the arena to get crowd reaction.
Let me see its tape.
I need to look at this part alone.
Come on.
You're the man.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
They were specifically told... they couldn't have a camera up there.
Don't give me that wounded look.
You haven't got the face for it.
I just received word...
Secretary Charles Evans
Kirkland is dead.
He passed away at 10:48 p. m.
At this time I'd like to extend my deepest sympathies... to the secretary's family... and to the nation... and to the people that... he so faithfully and proudly served.
And...
I have something else to say.
To those that would try to bully us or to terrorize us, to divert us from the causes of peace and justice,
Kevin.
I want you to know that in spite of what's happened here tonight, we are not deterred.
Production of the AirGuard missile system will go ahead... in accordance with
Secretary Kirkland's wishes.
It's called the first draft of history.
It's going to hold.
Why did it have to be me?
Why'd you want me next to you?
One, I needed a cop to back up my alibi.
Two,
I knew you could be bought if anything went wrong.
No of fence, pal, but
I never thought... you'd get as far as you did.
You're my best friend.
You used me, made me a sucker, and that hurts me, because I would've done anything for you.
Then tell me where the girl is.
She didn't do nothing wrong. She was... just trying to save some guys' lives, soldiers, like you used to be.
I mean, who the hell are you now, anyway?
Don't talk to me about soldiers.
What do you know about being a good soldier, the guy who finds an envelope full... of cash in a squad car every Friday?
What do you think I've been doing for the last ten years?
Strutting on the boardwalk and picking up hookers?
When the Renville took that lraqi missile hit below decks, do you know what happened?
A hole ripped open in the bulkhead, and the sea flooded in.
We had 60 seconds to maintain watertight integrity.
I had to go below and give the order... to dog the hatches.
That meant... that 28 men... that were still in... the main engine space were trapped.
You ever listen to a man drowning?
They don't die quietly.
Those men deserved a decent point defense system.
The AirGuard is it.
Yeah, it has glitches, but... you don't abandon the whole system... because of a few bugs.
You fix it.
Charles Kirkland... was a politician.
A baby kisser, not a soldier.
And when the political wind said, 'Cut defense spending', he started playing political games with real soldiers' lives.
He forced Powell into an early test.
He positioned the system to fail, because he didn't want to pay for it.
So we pay.
We die.
We need the AirGuard, and that girl is in the way now, Rick.
Just tell me where she is.
All right, Rick.
Pick a number.
How much is it gonna take... for you to look the other way like you have all your life?
Three hundred grand?
Five hundred?
A million dollars.
One million.
A million bucks.
You hit the jackpot here.
All you have to do is cash in the ticket.
Don't you think Angela would like... a few nice things for once in her life?
Don't you think she deserves them?
I never killed nobody.
What?
I said I never killed nobody.
You won't have to.
She's my problem.
You just tell me where she is... and never hear another word about her.
One million dollars.
I know that's a whole shitload of money, but...
I can't do it.
Kevin, you just pulled a gun on me.
Get back.
Or what?
Oh, God!
Goddam it. I'm under a lot of pressure here, all right?
Be smart.
Just take the money.
Please, Rick.
You're all alone on this.
What about Tyler?
Yeah. If he talked to me, he'll talk to somebody else.
Lincoln and I have come to an understanding.
You got nothin', kiddo.
Snake eyes. The house wins.
- Now, where is she?
- Fuck you.
Don't make it so he can't talk.
Why don't you at least try, man?
I am trying.
That's not a punch. Come on, girlie man. Show me what you got.
Champ. This the champ?
Look, why don't you just shut up, man.
This'll go a lot easier.
Sounds like three broken ribs to me!
What is this, a heroic stand?
You're the wrong guy for it, Rick.
You'll be all alone in... the spotlight, and guys like you can't stand up to that light.
You'll burn up under it.
The press starts looking... for dirt on you, and they will, it'll be a mud slide.
Forget about your job, your sweet life in Margate.
Start thinkin' about jail!
Your girlfriend will be gone, too, at the first sign of trouble, but not before she has a little chat with Angela!
So say goodbye to your wife too!
Twice a month with Michael... won't be so bad if you can get him to spend a night... in your shitty apartment!
You'll lose it all, my friend! Everything!
And your whole connected life will fall... the hell apart. Is that what you want?
All you gotta do is be consistent, for Christ's sake.
Do what you always do... take the money!
You wanna be a hero?
You wanna do something for your country?
Then tell me where the girl is!
If it was anybody but me, you'd be dead.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Lower. Stop.
Lower.
Stop. Lower.
Stop.
This is great stuff.
You know, we could sell this to local.
Who could we get outside for a stand-up?
Package is on the boardwalk.
Needs pick up at the Millennium entrance.
Let's go.
Goddam it! Shit!
I'd like to know what I did wrong to get all the shit assignments!
Just roll so we can get outta here!
In five, four, three...
Well, it looks like
Tropical Storm Jezebel... just may be a hurricane after all.
We are live on the boardwalk.
As you can see behind me, the huge metal globe... that is the emblem of the
Powell Millennium lies shattered.
Anthea, you look great, hon. Wait, can you get any closer to the globe?
Julia?
Julia?
This is an extremely hazardous...
Hang on. The Police
Emergency Unit should...
I think I see their truck.
Julia!
Julia!
Julia!
Kevin.
Tell her to unlock the door and come out.
No.
No, I won't tell her to unlock it.
Get outta the way!
The police are here... and are waving us off the boardwalk.
All right.
Okay.
She's all yours.
What the hell is that?
Goddam it, Rick!
I don't want to kill you!
Okay.
Look out!
- Put the gun down!
- On the ground right now!
- Lower your gun now, sir!
- No, wait! Wait a minute! Wait!
- I'm with D.O.D.!
- Put it down now!
- Listen to me! Listen!
- Put the gun down!
This... This woman is a suspect!
- We'll be forced to fire.
- No, she's a suspect, goddam it!
- I am Commander Kevin Dunne.
- I suggest you drop it now!
And this woman is a threat... to the security of the United States.
Rick, tell 'em!
Please, for God's sake, tell 'em what we got here!
There's no 'we', Kevin!
- You got snake eyes!
- Put the gun down, sir!
- Drop the gun, sir!
- Put the gun down!
- Now put it on the ground!
- Put the gun down!
Sir, please look at me!
You need to pay attention!
Now!
Yes. Now, put the gun on the floor, sir.
- Put the gun down!
- Please.
- We know who you are... No!
- Don't move, sir!
Let go of the handle!
Back away from... the door slowly and turn around!
- Slowly!
- We need to take the gun away.
- Hands where I can see 'em!
- Sir, please!
Please put it down, sir!
Get a paramedic quick!
Call for a paramedic now!
Get them outta here!
Today in Brighton
Park, Richard Santoro,
Atlantic City's new police hero, received a special valour award for heroism... from Mayor Frank Sanchini.
The mayor extended the public's thanks... to Santoro for his lifesaving efforts... on behalf of Julia Costello, the Powell Aircraft researcher... who exposed the deadly conspiracy... that led to the assassination... of Defence Secretary
Charles Kirkland.
Hey, Rick! Over here!
Hero cop Richard.
Santoro took a well-deserved break... from police work today with his son.
Meanwhile, the AirGuard investigation... continued in Washington, and Gilbert Powell announced more firings at Powell Aircraft... as he cleans house in the wake of the assassination.
There he is.
Richard Santoro's moment in the public eye... produced an unexpected backlash... this week... as allegations of corruption swirled around him.
Would you back off?
I'm Ricky, all right? Come on!
There have been allegations of bribery... coming out of the mayor's office.
- Could you comment on those?
- What about the cocaine...
Cocaine, my ass!
Santoro was unwilling to comment on the reports... which have come from numerous sources, both in the police department and elsewhere.
Give us a smile, Ricky!
We're waiting here outside... of the Atlanta County
Superior Court... for Richard Santoro who's just been indicted... on charges stemming from incidents that have been...
Where you going? Hey, hey, hey, Rick! Could you... Mr Santoro!
Mr Santoro, could you comment... on this indictment, sir? Mr Santoro!
What are you tryin' to do, kill me?
- Yeah. Nice goin', Al.
- Hey, that's what hard hats are for.
A reporter told me where to find you.
I came twice before, but you were out.
Yeah, I've had a lot of social engagements lately.
Yeah, I was surprised you stayed in town.
I thought you'd wanna move away.
Actually, I'm gonna be spending some time upstate.
Upstate?
I keep dreaming
I'm back in that tunnel, underwater, only in my dream I drowned.
Wonder what they would've said about me then.
You didn't have to do what you did, and I know what it cost you, and if it helps I just...
Don't try to make a hero out of me. It won't fit.
If I hadn't put a face to you, things probably would've gone a whole lot different.
But they didn't.
I testified this morning at the AirGuard hearings.
- Yeah? How'd it go?
- Very well, I think.
The whole system is being dumped.
The company's being completely restructured.
There are gonna be... all sorts of indictments up and down the administration, and things have really changed.
I know you may not... wanna see it right now, but it's true.
It's gonna be so different in Atlantic City.
You know, they say back 200,300 years ago... pirates put phoney lighthouses right out by those big rocks, right out there.
Ships would set a course by the lights, crash on the rocks, then everybody'd go out and rob 'em blind.
Only one thing's changed since then... lights are brighter.
- I'm naive.
- There's worse things to be.
Yeah.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
- You got family around here?
- Yeah.
You got a wife?
She ran away.
- Girlfriend?
- Well, she ran away too.
- Sorry.
- Well, it could've been worse.
How?
They could've run away with each other.
Yeah.
So, maybe in about
12 to 18 months... from now I'll give you a call.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Hey.
What the hell.
At least I got to be on TV.
Come on. Let's go.
Get back to work.
You guys get this done.
Come on. Everybody up. Let's go.
Come on.
We ain't got much sun left.

You don't seem like you're from here.
I was born here, didn't like it...
...moved away.
Figured out the part
I didn't like was me.
So I worked on that, and I moved back.
I got my first kiss right here.
Sammy Jenks.
Gave him a black eye.
You did? How hard?
That's what love'll do.
I have trouble picturing what kind of woman you'd take the trouble to marry.
First love situation.
We got married a week after graduating college, if you can believe that.
So what happened?
You want to hear my sob story?
I think she thought she was marrying Norman Mailer.
She thought I'd be famous.
After the book was published, she'd wake up at the crack of dawn on Sunday...
...make coffee, cross her fingers...
...and look in that Sunday Times, sure it was going to be a bestseller.
One Sunday, she didn't wake up early, didn't make coffee...
...didn't cross her fingers...
...and I knew.
She left you because your book wasn't a hit?
I don't know, Kelso.
It seems pretty shallow to me.
What about you and Joe Odom?
Me and Joe.
We're just friends.
We have a real musical relationship.
We're like the Steve and Eydie of Savannah.
My God, it's quiet.
Too quiet.
Joe'll be playing at that bar until dawn.
I should probably go.
In case you're wondering, this is the perfect time for a kiss.
Sammy Jenks warned me about you.
Good night.
Ladies and gentlemen, you constitute our jury for this trial.
It's expected to last several days.
I'll let you go home for the evening...
...instruct you to be back in the morning at 9:30 in the jury room.
If anybody tries to approach you about this case...
...report it to me the first thing in the morning.
You're excused for the evening.
Mr. Driggers, let me speak to you.
Luther, listen.
This is a courtroom. Don't bring those flies in here tomorrow.
And leave that vial of water, or whatever that stuff is, at home.
Sam...
...you know, when we were in Georgia,
I know how you hated my bugs...
...and you know how I love them.
We're no longer at the university.
This is a courtroom.
I'm telling you to leave all that foolishness at home.
I do take umbrage.
But I'll do it.
What is the story with the guy with the horsefly epaulets?
Luther Driggers.
He's a genius.
Developed the "No-Bug" strip.
The company he worked for took the credit and the money.
Now he just wanders around town with a bottle of poison in his pocket.
Of course.
Says someday he's going to put it in the water supply, do us all in.
Why do you want him on the jury?
We're the defense team.
We need all the nuts we can get.
What about Largent?
Finley's up for reelection.
If he strikes Luther...
...he might upset him enough to...
...you know...
I'll be back in on Sunday.
You've got a murder trial starting in 3 days. Where you going?
Home opener against 'Bama.
Go, Dogs!
Is he really leaving?
Oh, yeah.
Better say a prayer.
All right, Mr. Largent...
...the state has the burden of proof, and you have the opening.
Your Honor.
Good morning, Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
The state of Georgia is ready and most anxious to proceed.
If the court pleases.
The philosopher Thomas Hobbes is quoted as saying...
...that life is...
...nasty, brutish...
...and short.
And surely it must have seemed so to Billy Hanson...
...as he lay wounded...
...his blood and his life...
...oozing out onto Jim Williams' Persian rug.
It's important for you to know that the defendant...
By the end of this trial...
...I believe...
...that when faced with the evidence...
...you will render...
...the verdict that is fair and just:
Guilty of first-degree murder.
Thank you.
All right, Mr. Seiler, we've been going for some time now.
Would you prefer to make your opening statement after recess?
I would prefer to address the jury now, Your Honor.
What I have to say won't take long.
I apologize if I look tired...
...if my eyes are red...
...if my complexion is sallow.
But I came by it honestly.
Because...
...I have not had much sleep lately.
For while my bed is soft...
...my client's is not.
And while I'm surrounded by my loving family...
...Jim Williams...
...my friend...
...my client...
...is locked up in a room...
...full of thieves, murderers and rapists.
You're the ones I want.
You're the ones I trust.
Because although it is Jim Williams on trial here today...
...when I look at the circumstances...
...I think to myself...
...there...
...but for the grace of God, go you...
...or I.
You know why?
Because I guaran-damn-tee you:
Someone comes into my home and shoot at me, I will shoot back.
And I'll shoot back again and again...
...and again, until I'm sure that they're dead.
Until I'm sure that my home and my family are safe.
And then...
...old Finley here, my friend...
...would be prosecuting me.
I'd be the one on trial.
And my life...
...would be in the hands...
...of good folks like you.
He is way out-of-bounds.
He didn't object once during ours.
We'll look like assholes.
Folks not swayed by fancy words.
Folks who would not be prejudiced...
...who would not judge a man...
...by the color of his skin...
...or the amount of money that he makes.
I will say...
...the simple fact of the matter...
...is...
...Jim Williams...
...murdered no one.
How did you think it went?
Because I was very pleased.
Sonny has a certain style, a flair, doesn't he?
From what I've seen...
...that man could weave horseshit into Egyptian cotton.
Pleasantly surprised.
John Kelso,
I hope you understand.
Might I consider you my friend?
Yes.
The lack of gunshot residue in the hand, plus the other things I mentioned...
...led me to the conclusion that the scene was contrived.
Thank you, Detective Boone.
No further questions.
Detective...
...I'd like to revisit some of the things...
...you said just then in direct.
You testified there was blood on Hanson's hand, correct?
Yes. There was blood in the palm of the victim's hand.
And that's important because if Hanson had been holding the gun...
...there'd be no blood.
But you never saw the blood on the victim's hand, did you?
No.
The blood was noted in the autopsy report.
I didn't turn them over when I bagged them.
I believe you also testified that...
...you believe the final shot was fired from above the victim, is that correct?
I concluded that the shot came from someone standing over the victim...
...execution style.
A coup de grâce.
A coup de grâce?
Will you tell the jury, please...
...did you find Jim's prints on Billy's gun?
The Luger handle has a textured surface.
Is the answer no, Detective?
Yes, the answer was no.
Yes, the answer is no.
State's 22, Your Honor.
Who's this handsome fellow?
That's me.
Who's this?
That's that reporter fella from up north.
The one that's working with Williams.
I don't know how he got in.
And this?
Young officer...
...name escapes me.
Understandable. You'd need a program to keep track of everyone in that room.
Objection!
Counsel's testifying.
Strike that.
I would much rather have the detective tell us.
How many people was in that room?
Seven.
No, eight.
"Seven, no, eight."
And a pussycat.
Read the funny papers, Detective?
Not often.
In the funny papers they sometimes have this little competition...
...to find an animal hidden in an illustration.
I love to play it with my grandson.
You know that game?
We're going to play "Where's Shelton?"
I don't know what Mr. Seiler's trying to prove with all this, but I assume...
Mr. Finley, we can all play.
Shelton Williams...
...is the defendant's tabby cat.
Now, Detective...
...let's play "Where's Shelton?"
I'll give you a clue.
Take a look at the rug.
Is the answer "yes"?
State's 22, Your Honor.
Tabby cat.
Is Shelton Williams on your payroll?
I've heard tell of cat burglars.
Is this a cat detective?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'll tell you what's ridiculous.
You saying that the scene of the crime was secured.
That's what's ridiculous.
Seven, no, eight people, and a pussycat, walking all around that room...
You call that secure?
We hung around a lot.
Billy had a car and he'd give me rides sometimes.
Mr. Tucker, do you, of your own knowledge...
...know anything of the relationship between Billy Hanson and...
...Jim Williams?
Objection.
Objection, Your Honor.
Let me see you gentlemen over here a minute.
What's this about?
Your Honor, if this boy says what I think he's going to say...
...you can't ask the jury to ignore it.
You can't let a skunk go in the box and then say they didn't smell it.
Our intention with Mr. Tucker is to show the victim was afraid of the defendant.
To do that, he has to describe the nature of the relationship.
Your intention is to paint Jim Williams pink...
...then rely on some prejudice in the jury.
Besides which, whatever he says will be secondhand.
It would be hearsay.
He asked the witness if he knew of his own knowledge.
If he knows, it's not hearsay.
I'll allow it...
...but I'll grant you the same latitude when it's your turn.
Objection's overruled.
Mr. Tucker, the question was,
"Do you, of your own knowledge...
...know anything of the relationship between Hanson and the defendant?"
Yes, sir.
Jim would give Billy money when he needed it.
He bought him a car and clothes for going to bed with him.
To sleep with him?
To...
...have sex with him?
Yes, sir.
Now, did Billy and Jim Williams...
...have any disagreements...
...if you know?
All the time.
Jim would be pissed off at Billy...
...for one thing or another.
He was real jealous of Billy.
And what feelings, if any...
...did Billy have about the defendant?
Jim is a rich and powerful man.
Billy was a little afraid of him,
I guess.
Thank you.
Minerva.
Tell me...
...how well did you know Billy Hanson?
What kind of friends were you?
Yes, sir.
He was my best friend in the world.
We saw each other all the time.
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.
And nothing you wouldn't do for him.
If you're trying to say I'm lying,
I'm not.
Take it easy, young man.
Everything I say is true.
Of course. There's no reason for it not to be. That's all we're after here.
How well did you know Jim Williams?
You never did meet him, did you?
Not shaking hands or nothing.
But I stood next to him in the emergency room when Billy O.D.'d.
Billy Hanson...
...overdosed on drugs?
When?
About a month before Jim killed him.
So Jim Williams...
...took Billy Hanson to the hospital.
He saved his life.
If he wanted him dead...
...why would he do that?
I don't know.
I guess...
Did you...
...ever have sex with Billy?
No. No, sir.
Are you yourself a homosexual?
Objection.
Relevance?
Mr. Largent, you opened that door.
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
I'll let it in.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Want me to repeat the question, George?
I could have the court reporter read it out.
No, sir. I ain't no fairy.
I've had some experiences, but...
...I'm out of it now.
Out of it?
Yes, sir.
Would you care to explain to the jury what you mean by that?
It's wrong.
The Bible says so.
Bible also says it's wrong to lie.
How long have you been out of it?
Almost 3 weeks.
Congratulations, George.
Good for you.
No further questions, Your Honor.
- Please.
- Chablis, it's a subpoena!
They'll hold you in contempt.
I don't care if it's an invitation from God. They fuck with the Doll...
- You got that off TV.
- Whatever.
They'll hold you in contempt.
I've been held in contempt before.
A man's life is at stake.
What do I have to do with that man's life? Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Wait. I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.
What kind of deal?
What kind of deal?
Wait, John, be patient.
I'll tell you what.
You bring me a truckload of good-looking boys to my show tonight...
...and I'll think about it.
I'd love to, but I can't.
I got to go to some cotillion.
How boring.
What cotillion are you going to?
The Alpha Phi.
The black people's ball?
You're going to the black people's ball?
- Absolutely not.
- Please? Take me.
I'll be on my best behavior.
I promise, John.
Please take me.
- I can't.
- I won't shake my ass or cuss.
I won't do anything.
Please.
These girls are debutantes.
What does that mean? I can't clientele with uptown black-ass people?
No, but, you know, debs are carefully scrutinized.
Please. And?
For the most part...
...not many of them hide their candy...
...and few have been caught shoplifting.
You know, not many.
These bitches must do it damn good, if they haven't gotten caught yet.
I imagine they do a lot of volunteer work, Frank.
Stay out of bars, go to churches.
Those kind of ladies.
First of all, don't you ever call me Frank again.
And are these black girls we're talking about?
If these are black girls, they must be some ugly bitches, honey.
Take me.
- Please?
- Come on.
Take me.
- Cut it out.
- Please take me.
It's good to have you here.
You know, this is our 40th year.
It's lovely.
I do believe we've almost caught the white cotillion.
Congratulations.
Good evening.
Sir, is this spot taken?
- No, ma'am.
- Please don't call me ma'am.
My name's Chablis.
What's yours?
Phillip. I'm an escort.
An escort.
Do you work for a service?
No, I'm escorting my sister.
Don't tell me you're doing it with her.
My sister's boyfriend decided not to come, so I got roped into it.
Let me ask you something.
You ever been arrested?
Oh, come on.
Once, sort of.
I had a few drinks.
I got a ticket for disturbing the peace.
Disturbing the peace.
I got a piece you can disturb, hon.
I've been admiring your gown.
Thank you very much.
This old thing?
It's very glamorous.
Thank you very much.
Of whom are you a guest?
I'm here with my cousin.
My cousin...
...LaVella.
LaVella.
She's a lovely girl.
Oh, I think so too.
She's always wanted this...
...since we were kids.
She never thought she'd get it.
She had nothing to worry about.
You know what, hon?
I told her the same thing.
If Vanessa Williams can pull one off on the Miss America committee...
...then her little whoring around in Atlanta, Georgia...
...was not going to mean anything to a little steering committee in Savannah.
And she got it.
I'm so happy for her.
Would you watch my purse?
Phillip and I are going to go disturb the peace.
What do you think?
Let's go disturb some peace.
Come on.
Oh, Jesus!
Would you excuse me for one moment?
You have a lot of nerve busting in on me like this.
I got plenty of nerve to do anything I want to do.
- How far are you going to take this?
- I'm just starting.
Then I'm going to leave.
I don't intend on insulting these people any more than I have to.
Behave yourself.
Come on. Let's go.
Stop pushing me. I'm going.
Bartender, could I please have two apple schnapps?
I think you better make those doubles.
So, John, tell me, you mad at me, honey?
Are you mad?
Are you?
- We're still friends.
- I hope so. I must tell you something.
You are so sexy when you're mad.
- Behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.
I want to propose a toast.
From my top...
...to your bottom...
...from your bottom to my top...
...from my middle to your middle...
...be good, John,
I just might give you a little.
- Just behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.
Besides, your star witness is testifying.
Since when?
Since I thought about it.
And I realized how nice you've been to me.
You know what?
You've treated me like a perfect lady.
You've even made me feel so very special.
You know, people can be so mean sometimes.
But not you.
I want to ask you something.
John, do you think I'm beautiful?
Yes, I think you're very pretty.
Pretty? I'm just not your type?
Are you testifying for me?
Of course I am. You think I give a shit about Miss Jim Williams?
I don't even know that bitch.
Never even met her.
Listen...
...on cross-examination they'll be pretty rough on you and your background.
I have nothing to hide and I'm not ashamed of anything I've ever done.
You should know that you taking the stand is a blanket indictment of Hanson.
Let me get this right, now.
You're saying because Billy hung out with drag queens, he deserved to die?
- It's fucked up, but, yeah.
- That's fucked up.
Maybe you shouldn't testify.
John, how sweet. You really care.
Good. Because, guess what?
I'm testifying.
I am testifying.
You see, those folks think they're using the Doll...
...but the Doll's using them right back.
I'm going to use that courtroom as my coming-out party.
You see, you know who I am.
I'm the Lady Chablis.
Hear me roar.
Look out!
Besides,
I've already bought a new ensemble.
- Really? Is it nice?
- You'll see, hon.
Listen to me.
We must get out of here.
It's rude of you to bust in on me.
I'd never do that to you.
LaVella's mother is about to have a seizure.
Somebody put a spoon in her mouth, then, because I'm not leaving.
You're leaving now.
- I am not.
- I'll buy you a drink.
- Buy me a drink.
- Outside of here.
- Buy me a diamond.
- I'll buy you a diamond.
- Give me some.
- I'm not giving you shit.
Oh, come on!
You know I'm straight.
So am I.
Straight to my house. Let's go.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, so help you God?
I do.
Now, Miss De Veau...
...I'll ask you a question and
I want you to answer to the jury...
...so that they can understand.
Yes, and what is that?
You'd like me to explain my "T"?
Your "T"?
My "T."
Yeah, explain your "T"...
...in as plain a language as you possibly can for our friends.
I will try my best to explain to you jurors.
I could throw words and labels at all of you...
...but you seem like nice people.
So I'm going to be open and honest.
I have a man's toolbox...
...but everything else about me is pure lady.
I love to dress in women's clothes.
I love to go shopping.
I love to have my nails done...
...and I love men.
Any questions?
And, ma'am,
I hope you don't mind my saying...
...blue is definitely not your color.
Okay, gals, you're both pretty, now.
What I want to know and want you to tell the jury is...
...how you and Billy Hanson first met.
Billy hit on me one night at the...
Strike that, Your Honor.
Billy and I clienteled.
"Clienteled."
Will you explain what that means?
We socialized together for a little while, until he met my roommate Corinne.
Corinne.
Now, you telling me that...
...Corinne and Billy Hanson were intimate?
Hot and intimate.
Will you tell the jury...
...did Billy Hanson use drugs?
Yes. Billy did pills, smoked pot...
...little coke.
He sold drugs.
He'd stay with us sometimes, so sometimes we had stash around the house.
- Mrs. Chablis...
- Miss.
Course, Miss Chablis.
Do you yourself take drugs?
I smoke a little pot.
I'm a mellow kind of girl.
I understand.
Well, tell me if you know what effect, if any...
...these drugs had on the relationship...
...between your friend Corinne and Billy.
Well, now, when Billy got high, he could be very, very hostile.
Hostile, when he was high.
Would you explain to the jury what you mean by hostile?
I can do more than that, hon.
Let me show you something.
Look at my driver's license.
- Just a minute.
- Objection.
This isn't proper.
Be quiet.
I'll handle this.
Just a minute.
That's not proper procedure.
Pick up this item, please.
My eye. He hit me. I looked like that dog from The Little Rascals.
Members of the jury, I'm instructing you to disregard this outburst.
Pay no attention to that picture.
Your Honor? It's the truth.
I'm not lying.
Your Honor, the people...
Be quiet.
Now we got to get this thing under control.
You sit down, Mr. De Veau.
Miss De Veau. I'm a single girl.
Miss De Veau, whatever.
Have a seat.
Okay, but please don't get too huffy.
You listen to me.
I'm in charge of this courtroom, not you.
Here's the way it works:
These lawyers are going to ask you questions...
...and you answer them.
If I tell you to stop, you stop.
If I tell you to sit, you sit.
And I don't want you to communicate directly with that jury.
Don't produce any more items.
Don't show any photographs.
Do you understand that?
Yes, Your Honor.
I understand.
Mrs. Wright threw in some gumbo.
I got you cigarettes.
Thank you. How are we coming with our character witnesses?
I thought we would limit it to 3 because we don't need too much fawning and...
Why not?
Tell him how many friends are lining up to defend me.
I suggest Wanda Javitz.
She has a commanding vocal presence.
She declined, Jim...
...along with some others.
Declined?
They clamored for my friendship.
Hoping and praying for invitations to my parties.
Where were their judgments then?
I hope Wanda knows this puts her in the out box for my Christmas party.
I don't think we have to worry about character witnesses.
They got theirs, we got ours.
When do I take the stand?
Last.
Good.
They'll have heard all the theories.
We'll finish with the truth.
I look forward to this.
It's important, not that I'm acquitted, but that everyone knows I'm innocent.
I refuse to live in a world where whispers become fact.
Guilty men murmur.
The innocent shout to the rafters.
Hear, hear.
We may need you to come clean about the relationship with Billy.
Your sexuality, Jim.
Finley's taken this thing in a direction we didn't count on.
His own private witch-hunt.
It's going to destroy Mother.
Jim, she was in court.
She heard George Tucker.
Face it, she already knows.
Not from me she doesn't.
What if she wasn't in court?
What's the matter?
Gunpowder?
Damn gunshot residue test.
Your expert witness covered it.
He said the tests are unreliable.
Jury thinks that's a cop-out.
Every one of them knows Doc Poe.
Why listen to some egghead from up north? No offense.
No, none taken.
He said gunpowder wipes off.
Maybe when they handled the body...
Boone says he bagged them.
Doc Poe says they were bagged when he performed the autopsy.
When are they going to get wiped off?
I don't know.
Do you remember when you told me that dead men tell no tales?
See, I think...
...that may be true, but it does not apply here.
I mean, look around.
Every picture on every wall in this town is of someone who's gone.
Every story you hear begins with someone who's dead.
The only living national treasure you have is your own slavering mutt.
You writing your book?
What the hell are you talking about?
Billy Hanson may not be talking, but his hands are.
Billy Hanson's hands?
I got to go.
Where you going?
"To understand the living...
...you got to commune with the dead.
I need Shango.
Now go.
And don't you dare look back."
I hope you can communicate with someone.
Feel like going for a walk?
Where you headed?
I don't know, I was thinking about maybe stopping by the morgue.
Are you a necrophiliac or something?
We agreed you wouldn't talk about my ex-wife.
- How long you been at the bar?
- Long enough. It'll be fun.
Why do you want to go?
If I could answer that question,
I wouldn't have to go.
The morgue's closed, and by tomorrow this won't seem like such a good idea.
Precisely. I'll break in if I have to.
I don't care. I'll pretend I'm dead.
- You sure you want to do this?
- I think so.
There is a back way...
...a hallway off the emergency room.
It's off-limits.
- How do you know that?
- I candy-striped one summer.
At the morgue?
- We'll create a distraction...
- We?
You create the distraction and I'll just slip in and check it out.
No, you'll get lost.
All right, it's a 3-man job.
Where's Joe?
Perfect casting, but he's out of town till tomorrow.
Who do we know who can cause a commotion?
Hello! Nurse!
- What's wrong with her?
- Her stomach.
Appendicitis.
My water broke.
Get the doctor to exam 4.
Water broke? She's pregnant.
I don't know what's up. Just help.
- What's wrong?
- A stomach problem.
Let's get her up on the table.
Okay, here we are.
Commune away.
Is this where it hurts?
Just...
Oh, doctor, wait.
Here?
You know, I think you need to go just a little bit lower.
Never been in a morgue.
What are we looking for?
I don't know. Something about the bagging of the hands.
Oh, look. Teddy Lipscomb.
Excuse me?
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, he was my dad's dentist.
Oh, man!
Cardiac arrest.
Right. Medical term for dying in the arms of a 25-year-old cocktail waitress.
Poor guy.
See, now, remind me never to get sick in Savannah.
He's wearing a hospital I.D. Bracelet.
You're supposed to get well in hospitals, but not in this city.
The morgue doesn't have its own ramp, so all DOA's come through emergency.
Technically, they'd have to be admitted.
They're all wearing bracelets.
It's bureaucratic red tape.
I told you, I candy-striped.
You did.
That's like volunteer work?
Yeah, cute little striped outfit, short skirt.
Girl Scouts.
- Is this where it hurts?
- Almost.
Just a tad bit...
That's the spot.
I love you.
I love you.
Oh, Dr. Feelgood, that's the spot.
You got it.
You wouldn't take a bag off to put an I.D. Bracelet on, would you?
Yeah, probably.
Maybe.
Pleasure's been all mine, Doctor.
How you doing, Mom?
Nurse, I have a question for you.
Were you on duty the night
Billy Hanson's body came in?
I was.
How'd you get back there?
Back door.
I was here with the sick lady?
I have a question.
Hanson's hands were bagged.
Someone had to put the I.D. Bracelet on.
Would you take the bag off to slide the bracelet on?
No, they snap on.
They snap on?
Thank you.
It was easier with him because I bagged him after.
Excuse me?
Doc Poe called from the crime scene and said to bag the hands when he came in.
You bagged the hands?
Yes, I wrote it up on the admission sheet.
May I see that?
We'll let Sonny tell you.
He'll be here any minute.
Before Sonny gets here,
I'd like to run something by you.
- Fire away.
- About that night.
What do you got?
The evening started out as I've always said.
The argument...
... the shouting...
You let me down, like everyone else.
My mama let me down. She hates me because I look like my daddy.
- What are you yelling about?
- I'm yelling about you!
It's fine for you to talk to me about living in this grandeur and all.
You could do it if you took responsibility.
Bullshit, Jim!
If you don't like it, why don't you just get the hell out?!
Get the hell out.
This candle is about ready to go through that painting!
I'll stop paying the insurance on your Camaro.
You want to leave, you can do it tomorrow morning.
The damaged clock...
Goddamn it.
Walk into my house and ruin my furniture. I've had it.
You're going to jail, young man.
That's it.
Billy pointing the Luger...
I may be leaving tomorrow...
...but goddamn it...
But here's the difference:
When he pulled the trigger...
...you're leaving tonight.
... nothing happened.
The gun was on safety.
As he fumbled to take the safety off,
I grabbed my own gun...
... and I shot him.
He fell dead.
He never fired?
No.
I thought, "What have you done?!"
It explains...
...why there's no powder on Billy's hands.
When I sit on that stand and I tell this to the jury...
...Largent's case...
...will crumble.
I don't see how you figure that.
If you tell that story...
...you're admitting...
...that you lied.
Lied to everyone.
The police...
...the press...
...everyone.
Yes.
Of course.
I'd rather be convicted of lying than of murder.
So...
Hey, coach.
We got it.
Keep your seat.
Sonny, I need to tell you something.
Now, me first.
You know that gunshot residue test?
What I have to say has direct bearing on the gunshot residue...
Can I get this out?
We got them by the gonads.
Detective Boone lied.
Doc Poe called the admitting nurse and told her to bag the hands...
...if they were not already.
Which she did.
Right here in this document.
Many could have handled the body between the crime scene and the hospital.
Which explains how the powder got rubbed off.
There it is.
The death knell to Finley Largent's precious gunshot residue test.
Your turn.
What was it?
Oh, it's not important.
Take a look here.
We got them, Jimbo.
Going somewhere, coach?
What's his story?
You're still under oath.
Frank...
...are you absolutely sure...
...that you bagged Billy Hanson's hands at Mercer House?
Yes.
I have no further questions.
Redirect, Mr. Largent?
No, Your Honor.
Detective, you're excused. You're still under subpoena. Thank you very much.
Defense calls Sara Warren...
...R.N.
You won't find her in your notes.
She's not on your list, Finley.
Sara Warren is a direct rebuttal to the testimony of Detective Boone.
She is, in fact, an admitting nurse...
...at Chandler Emergency Room.
Mr. Williams, will you describe
your relationship with the deceased?
I met Billy Hanson when he came around to the house wanting a job.
So...
...I hired him in the workshop to refinish furniture.
He had some talent, and I wanted to encourage him.
During this time...
...I developed hypoglycemia. I blacked-out at times. I don't eat well.
The doctor told me...
...it was not good for me to be alone when this condition occurs.
So Billy would stay over...
...and take care of me when I wasn't well.
He did not live at Mercer House, as has been stated.
Is that the full extent of your relationship with Billy Hanson?
No. Over time, it evolved into something less formal.
We became intimate.
Billy could be very charming.
He had his girlfriends and I had mine.
But to me...
...sex is a perfectly natural thing.
It didn't bother me.
It didn't bother him.
It was just an occasional natural occurrence between consenting adults.
Would you describe to the jury...
...the events that occurred in your house...
...after the party?
By the time Billy got back to the house he was quite high...
...and we got into an argument about a planned trip to London.
I was going to an auction, and Billy was to accompany me because of my condition.
But he insisted on taking marijuana cigarettes.
I do not approve of drugs and I told him he could not go.
He became verbally abusive and I ordered Billy out of the house.
He went into the hallway.
The argument continued there.
Then he knocked over a clock.
I went to call the police.
He followed me with a gun.
He said...
...and I'll never forget this:
"I might leave tomorrow...
...but goddamn it, you're leaving tonight."
I saw that Luger...
... and moved.
I reached in a drawer for my own weapon.
As I came up, the first shot...
... I felt breeze by my shoulder.
And I fired.
I don't remember how many times.
It was horrible.
We're all Savannahians.
Our paths cross from time to time.
We greet each other.
Smile here, nod there.
But even if we don 't know each other...
... we have one thing in common.
This beautiful place where we all live.
And as one Savannahian...
... to 12...
... I'd like to thank you
for your civic pride...
... for your diligence...
... and here in this courtroom...
... for your rapt attention.
I've watched you taking notes.
The prosecution started this whole thing...
...quoting someone by the name of Hobbes.
I don't know who that is...
...but...
...I do know who Perry Mason is.
You watch Perry Mason?
I do.
And I got to thinking...
...if some TV writer...
...was to come to Perry Mason and say...
..."Here you are, Mr. Raymond Burr, here's a story like this."
You know what I think he'd say?
I think old Raymond would say...
"That's not a very good story.
I wouldn't have to be a very good lawyer...
...to get that man off, now would I?"
He'd be right!
Because...
...by all the evidence,
Jim Williams is an innocent man.
But I'm not Perry Mason.
I'm not some TV lawyer.
So I got to scratch and tear at the prosecution's case...
...trying to whittle it down to nothing.
And darned if I don't think I have!
Because the fabrication of the prosecution's case is in pieces.
When you consider how Detective Boone...
...has consistently lied about bagging the hands.
Does that surprise you...
...that a detective would lie?
Of course he will.
He's not a bad man.
But how else will he play the cards...
...that have been dealt to him from a pack of lies?
If Jim Williams...
...is guilty of anything...
...he's guilty of bad association.
But that's not why he's on trial for.
If you don't like...
...or if you don't cotton to his lifestyle...
...just think about this:
We deal with these people all the time.
Some good...
...some bad.
They're a part of our community.
You can't judge a man for that.
This is God's world.
Let God be the judge of that.
And let you good folks...
...be the judge of this.
Come on, now.
You let this man go home.
He's had enough.
Thank you.
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
Is it unanimous?
Yes!
Hand it to the sheriff, please.
Pick that up.
Hand it to me.
Give it back to him.
Defendant and attorneys, rise, please.
Publish the verdict.
"We, the jury, find the defendant...
...not guilty."
Members of the jury, this concludes your work.
You've rendered great service to Savannah and Chatham County.
I'm going to dismiss you now with the thanks of the court.
Congratulations, Jim.
Thank you, John.
Hey, boy!
What do you got?
Come on down.
We gots to go visit the boy.
We got to make him quit working James.
Trial's over, Minerva.
Billy can't do anything to James now.
Why I come to you?
Because you...
...out of everybody, know it ain't over yet.
I know, the boy know, and you know justice ain't been done yet.
I'll come down for a minute.
I don't know about this.
That's exactly why you come this far.
Billy always loved Wild Turkey.
He ain't happy here.
Ain't what he thought it would be.
If you ain't in heaven yet, you want to get there, don't you, boy?
The only way you're going to get up...
...is if you quit playing with James.
I has influence with the dead.
They can lift you up.
Nobody else can do that for you.
Nobody!
Don't you laugh at me!
You think you had a harsh life?
You got no idea.
Never had no bills to pay...
...no children to feed, no house to clean.
You had it easy.
You can just lay there.
Where's Jim?
Thanks for dropping by.
I've finished my Christmas party list...
...and you made the cut.
I'm honored, but I won't be here.
Many will be disappointed.
So, obviously, you've decided to stay in town.
Living here pisses off all the right people.
- What can I do for you?
- I have something for you.
Yussopov's dagger may have seemed...
...more useful, given your profession...
...but the painting somehow seemed appropriate.
I hope you will accept it...
...as an expression of my gratitude.
Newmarket Heath, the overpaint.
Thank you.
I'll have it sent along.
I don't want to keep you from your party.
But one more question, for the book.
Do you want to tell me what really happened?
Sport...
...truth, like art...
...is in the eye of the beholder.
You believe what you choose...
...and I'll believe what I know.
Good luck, Jim.
Why didn't you come in?
I never enter the office on Sunday.
Bad juju.
I still got a lot of questions.
You know all you need to know.
One thing...
...don't commune so long with the dead you forget the living.
What's this?
I love you, boy.
But I ain't the only one.
You know that, don't you?
How long's your lease?
Six months.
Welcome to Savannah.
You hungry?
- Come on.
- Let's go, girl.
You two know you're not going anywhere without a chaperone.
I cooked my Chablis' famous chicken.
Let's go have a picnic.
And guess what?
You get your choice of breast or thigh.
What's it called, the chicken?
Chablis' Kicking Chicken.
Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?
Yes, sir.
Patrick do like his morning walk.
Patrick is walking kind of fancy this morning, isn't he?

What is your deal?
I got a big game on Friday.
Look, it's no good. I need my fluids.
Your fluids?
Yeah.
Mary Jo, I'm curious.
Why would you do something like that?
Why not?
It's self-mutilation, really.
Self-mutilate this, fluid boy.
Good find, girl.
Yeah.
Who's that?
Oh, shit. No.
Slut.
Andy.
You want to step out for a minute?
You kids shouldn't be out past curfew.
Andy Effkin, toast with the most.
You like our chances against Knight's Ridge?
We should do fine.
Thrown for a loss.
Is your arm okay for the game?
- It's good.
- Offensive line up to par?
Son of a bitch.
Fuck.
Easy, Eff. Easy, buddy.
- I need my fluids.
- Give me the gun.
Get out of here, now.
What?
You gotta be shittin' me.
That's Mary Jo.
Clarice, it's Cox.
We got a wet one here on the bluff.
I just can't wait, Steve.
To do what?
To see my new room, my new school, my new everything.
Yeah, new everything.
It's gonna be awesome.
It's gonna be better.
Way better.
Come on.
Looks like you're moving to Cradle Bay.
- We sure are.
- Sure you'll like it here.
- You'll never want to leave.
- You hear that?
Hey, you. I thought you were gonna help me.
Come on.
Fridge.
Thank you.
You all right?
Yeah.
Just trying to put some of this stuff away.
Nervous?
- About what?
- First day at school.
Dad?
What are you doing, dipshit?
Don't worry about snakes in the garden... when you got spiders in your bed.
"They had been so innocent and little there.
And all beyond was so unknown and great."
Very good, Trent.
To wit, when Pip says this...
Dickens is speaking of the joy of discovery... of newness, of change.
Mr. Clark, perhaps you can relate.
Mr. Clark is new to us from Chicago.
Do they read Dickens in Chicago?
Dickie Atkinson.
Welcome.
Tell us why you're late.
Trouble with the camshaft?
Like you know what one is.
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the carburetor this morning.
Peckerhead.
What is... if I may display my ignorance... a peckerhead?
Why are you laughing, Whalen?
Nothing, Richard.
I was just thinking how ignorance kills.
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.
You ass-kissing little fuck!
Boys!
Perhaps yet another little sojourn to the principal will serve you well?
Want to know what a peckerhead is?
- That's a peckerhead.
- Thank you for the clarification.
Please send Principal Weathers our hosannas!
"Youth is wholly experimental."
Robert Louis Stevenson.
I know.
These seats taken?
No. Go ahead.
I am Gavin. This is U.V.
I'm Steve.
Munchies.
U.V. Has some primo weed.
We smoked a fatty during gym.
Check him out. He looks almost tan.
Hello, Lorna. How are you today, my dear?
- Drop dead.
- Contact.
- Who's that?
- That is Lorna "Love-itis" Longley.
Fire of my loins, purveyor of my every masturbatory fantasy.
The entire female gender is separated into two groups.
Lorna comprises one group.
All of womankind comprises the other.
You ever take her out?
Alas, Lorna is largely untouchable for someone of my social standing.
What do you mean?
It's a class system here at C.B. High, Stevie Boy.
Check it out.
There you got your motorheads, car jocks.
All the world's a gasket and a lube job and a pack of Luckys.
Music of choice: Posi-traction overdrive, classic rock...
Skynyrd, The Allmans, Bruce.
Drug of choice:
Beer, Miller Genuine Draft.
Keggers can't be choosers.

The sound of an Apple PC booting up.
Drug of choice: Stephen Hawking's
"A Brief History of Time"... and a cup of jasmine tea on a Saturday night.
Freaks that go squeak.
Over there you have your skaters.
Riffin', ragin' kids and their ramp tramps.
Baggy pants, Dickie wools, doing 50-50 grinds... with a gnarly grab finish on a homemade halfpipe in the woods.
Music of choice:
The whack of a hacky sack.
Drug of choice: Ecstasy, E-tab.
Baby, longer lovin' through science.
Freaks in sneaks.
Here's where it gets really nasty.
Lorna runs with that group there, the Blue Ribbons.
- What's that?
- It's a community group of good kids.
Have bake sales, car washes.
- Kiss a lot of adult sphincter.
- Blue Robots.
Here, here.
Those three guys: Cradle Bay's answer to Manson, McVeigh and O.J.
Trent Whalen, Andy Effkin, Robby Stewart.
I bet you didn't know that toast came in three flavors.
This group's music of choice: The hum of perfection, the buzz of ambition.
Drug of choice:
Life, the pursuit of clean living... at the expense of all who sniffle at the hem of their gowns.
Freaks, so chic.
Then you got kids like me and U.V.
Lames who like our metal heavy, our Marlboros light.
Music of choice: Harvester of Sorrow,
Language of the Mad.
Drug of choice: What do you got?
Freaks all week.
That's it. Lesson over.
Class dismembered.
Welcome to Cradle Bay High, Stevie Boy.
Welcome to my nightmare.
- Why can't we help you with your math?
- Just leave me alone.
Hello.
Phlegm.
P-H-L-E-M-G-H. Phlegm.
- Wrong.
- Let me see that.
- What are you two doing?
- We're having a spelling bee.
My brother Allen was the best speller.
- I thought your name was Steve.
- It is.
Allen's my brother who died.
I have a grandfather who died.
Why don't we change the subject?
- Pass your plate.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Nathan.
Shannon, do you get yelled at if you talk about your dead grandfather?
Around here people go crazy if you talk about a dead brother.
Hello?
I'm here for the Mustang parts.
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
The troops shall set you free.
What do you guys want?
Sweet Dickie, we want you.
We've got it for you, Richard.
We've got all the winning numbers.
We like to welcome all new students.
Standard procedure.
As soon as Dr. Caldicott arrives, we can begin.
Doctor?
He's the resident faculty fellow, an outstanding educator.
He's been with us two years now.
Works with the students in a counseling capacity.
I think you'll like him.
I'm sorry I'm late. Hi. Edgar Caldicott.
It's nice to finally meet you.
- Everything okay?
- Fine.
Have you given any thought to extracurricular activities or sports?
Not really.
- There's the Blue Ribbons.
- The Blue Ribbons?
Yeah. They help each other study and practice.
It's a team effort.
It's a motivational workshop, really.
The Blue Ribboners have truly been making the grade... and doing wonderful things on the playing field.
All of us here are aware of the tragedy back in Chicago.
- If there's anything we can do...
- I said everything's fine.
Steven, we know how tough it can be.
Whether or not you want to be involved with the school... we want to be involved with you.
- That's all the meeting is about.
- Okay.
So go make some new friends.
- Like that?
- What is it?
It's bona fide jitterbug.
It's my buddy, Rachel. Cook's Ridge trash.
She's a great chick, but she's Cook's Ridge trash.
Come on.
Dancing queen.
Rachel, this is Stevie Boy.
Good man.
This is Rachel. Cook's ridge trash.
Bite me.
Wow, appropriate sparks are flying.
Somebody cue the power ballad.
Fail to be a tumor, Gavin.
What do you say we cruise town, chase a case... hit the bluff and drink some beer?
Consecrate Stevie Boy's arrival to this new and pathetic tank town.
- You down?
- Sounds razor.
Stevie Boy?
Sure.
Excuse me, sir. Can you help me out?
- What?
- I'm trying to buy some beer.
I have the money and everything,
I'm just a month from...
Get off my case, kid.
You know, the problem with America... is mankind's abject unwillingness... to contribute to the delinquency of minors.
That was like the tenth guy.
- Chug.
- What are you doing?
- Chasing. Nobody's willing.
- Yeah?
Hello, Charles.
Cycle any anabolic goodies lately?
- You're funny, Strick.
- Thanks. I'm here all week.
A couple of us are going to the Yogurt
Shoppe later, if you want to come by.
The Yogurt Shoppe? Yeah.
You want to make an "active culture" joke here or should I handle this one?
- See you later.
- Bye.
- What?
- What?
You're actually flattered that barn door has a thing for you?
- Bullshit.
- Right.
There's for the syrup.
Is that the right one for the orange juice?
Where's the deodorant coupon?
It's here somewhere.
- What does a hooker say after 12 hours?
- What?
Clean up on aisle four.
Sorry.
Come here!
Easy.
Fuck! You Blue Ribbon shithead!
What was that all about?
Toxic Jock Syndrome.
- You'll be fine.
- Where's my shake?
What the hell would make a kid freak out like that?
It has to be steroids.
All those jocks are into it.
Kelly Connor saw Andy Effkin bite the head off a kitten in a fit of rage.
- No way.
- I'm serious.
I think it's bullshit, though.
It is not bullshit, and it's not steroids.
- Here we go.
- What?
Gavin thinks some sinister force is taking over the Cradle Bay meatheads.
- You know what it is.
- A sinister force?
You know, evil.
Nowhere to turn, no one to trust.
- Fail to be a bitch.
- Fail to be a pucker-ass.
- What?
- Nothing.
Let's go!
Andy killed her.
Everyone's saying she ran away.
I saw her dead body, but I can't prove it.
- Those fuckers.
- Why didn't you go to the police?
Cox was there, man.
The cop didn't do shit.
Fuck, nobody listens to me.
Cancer Corner.
Best place in the school to sneak a smoke.
What are you shitbirds doing down here?
- Relax, Mr. Newberry.
- You ain't supposed to be down here!
This is my friend, Steve.
He's new to the Bay.
Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.
Drag marks.
Drag marks of a rat's tail.
What have you got there?
It's an "E-rat-icator."
Sounds are supposed to scare the rats away.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
Scary, ain't it?
Piece of crap. Doesn't work worth spit!
A dollar for everything that didn't work worth spit.
Mr. Newberry has the Boo-Radley- village-idiot-Quasimodo thing going.
- Don't you?
- What?
And he's currently involved... in a war against the rodent population of Cradle Bay.
Gotta fight them!
Rats from the bay.
Incoming! You think you can run, but you can't hide!
- A day at the master races.
- Check that out.
Jesus.
Is that Dickie? What is he doing?
He's one of them now, bud.
He's a Blue Robot.
Watch and learn.
What the fuck?
They're peckerheads. Look at him.
He's killing his hard-on.
Fore!
Maybe he turned over a new leaf.
I would like to own the new leaf concession here in Cradle Bay.
Did you tell Steve about the murders?
Steve is a disbeliever.
The mysterious disappearance of Mary Jo
Copeland and Officer Kramer? Uh-huh.
This is where he accuses me of being paranoid.
"Denial" ain't just a river in Italy, bud.
Check your weed, boys.
- You are beige, boy.
- See you, Rachel.
Bye.
Here's your chocolate sundae.
Hope you guys...
Can I help you?
Steven, good to see you, brother.
Come sit down.
Steven, this is Kathy, Andy...
- Tom, Randi...
- Hi.
Lorna, Chug.
You know Robby and Dickie.
This is Steven. Sit down.
Steven's new to the Bay from Chicago.
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah, it's okay.
You had friends in Chicago?
Yeah.
You can have friends here.
Didn't you guys get in a fight in English?
We've made peace.
That's what separates us from the animals.
Dirtbag alert.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Easy, slick. Steven's relaxing.
The Yogurt Shoppe.
What the fuck is a "shoppy"?
Why don't you make like a tree and leave?
Clever girl. Come on, Steve.
We get in one argument, and you go bond with these guys?
What happened to you?
Did you eat too much flank steak?
- Let's go.
- You don't have to go, brother.
I'm not your brother.
You wanted to tell me something?
Here I am. What?
- They're hypnotized.
- What?
Maybe not hypnotized, but brainwashed, lobotomized, programmed.
Want proof? Here. Here's proof.
Look. That's Robby, Randi, Trent.
They used to be my friends.
Maybe they got sick of your rap.
I can relate.
I thought you'd say that. That is the purpose of tonight's excursion.
After tonight, you'll strap on a hog and be a man.
It's something that benefits everybody.
The Thespian Society, for example...
Blue Ribbon meeting. Every Monday.
This is where the shit goes down. Listen.
By conducting the bake sale in conjunction with the pep rally... we can be selling cakes and cookies when school spirit is at its optimum.
I had no idea the evil was this pervasive.
Jan, what's on your mind?
This may sound strange, but... although we couldn't be more pleased with Andrew's improved studies... he's become somewhat different... since returning from your weekend enlightenment seminar.
Different how?
He seems unkind to almost everyone outside of the club.
I can understand your concern.
Let me address it.
Kids being kids have a tendency to overreact.
We've found they go through a brief period... of being, shall we say, snobby.
But what it really is is a feeling that's new to them.
The feeling is pride.
They're improved.
When you soar with the eagles, the pigeons below look pedestrian.
- Give it a little time.
- Dork.
Now, a new candidate has been nominated.
His parents have been counseled and consented.
Colleen, if you will.
- Male, 17 years old...
- Superstar.
Suspended four times last school year.
Parents feel candidate is depressed... spending too much time listening to rock music and masturbating.
- Candidate has a history of truancy...
- Poor son of a bitch.
And a general lack of direction.
Candidate is C-minus student, yet has A-plus potential.
All in favor?
Great. February candidate confirmed.
- Training to begin ASAP.
- Shit.
- What?
- Join me in welcoming to our circle...
Ernest and Lucille Strick... the parents of our next superstar,
Gavin Strick.
They want you to join their club.
Shine them on and blow them off.
- What are they gonna do?
- You still don't get it.
You still think this is about blood drives and bake sales.
Wait a second.
Maybe you should lay off that shit.
Maybe you should eat me.
Yeah.
This is huge.
Why don't you see this is fucking huge?
Don't fucking "Gavin" me. I'm a dead man.
My parents sold me out.
You saw it. You were there.
Why don't you see this?
Stay at my house tonight.
I have to go home.
When I get there and they're waiting for me, I'll smoke them all. You hear me?
Everyone who's at my house:
Robby, Whalen, Caldicott, even my olds.
- Give me the gun.
- No fucking way.
- Let me have it!
- No! You're losing it!
You'll wind up shooting the paperboy.
- Just go home.
- Give me my fucking gun.
Good night.
Don't leave me alone like this!
Stevie Boy?
I would have smoked them all. Fuck, man.
Wait a minute.
- What is this?
- I don't believe...
Show time.
Who put the acid in my Spam?
- Hello.
- What is up with this?
I just want to apply myself.
I think I'll get better results on this side of the caf.
Beat it, honey. This is rarefied turf.
Sluts need not apply.
Later.
How much do I owe you?
- Treat yourself.
- Indeed.
- Where you going?
- I'm going to talk to Gavin.
You're not wanted, Steven.
Just leave him be.
Get the fuck off me.
Guys, come on.
What's your maladjustment?
You okay?
Forget it! Stop it!
That's enough!
What happened to you?
We shall overcome, Steven.
- You okay?
- Man, fantastic.
You'll see.
Retard.
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.
- I hate the caf.
- Everybody hates the caf.
They hate the ketchup.
I got...
That's not good.
Doesn't even look like ketchup.
"Slaughterhouse-Five"?
What? Give me that!
What the hell's the matter with you?
You rats from the Bay. You rats!
Rats everywhere.
You kids think you know everything!
You don't know nothing!
Forget the rats. It's all an act.
- You don't know.
- It's all bullshit.
Get away from me!
Brother!
Wait.
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut?
I don't get it.
Didn't you ever want to just disappear, lunch boy?
Poof, you're gone.
You'd be surprised how interesting people become... when they think you are really stupid.
- Who is it?
- Calm down, Steven.
Where you going, Steven?
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Here is the light, Steven.
Hello, Steven.
What are you doing here?
- I'm tutoring Lindsay in Algebra.
- Where is she?
- Where's my sister?
- She's upstairs sleeping.
- Where are my parents?
- At a meeting.
- What meeting?
- Steven, you're hurt.
- I'll live.
- Let me put something on that.
It's fine.
Maybe you should go.
I mean it.
- If that's what you want.
- Yeah.
Can I go to the bathroom first?
Sure. It's around the corner.
I know where it is.
Of course you do. Everyone knows where everything is around here.
Your sister's a great kid.
She's very special.
Hello, Steven.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure really.
Go home, Lorna.
You don't find me slightly attractive?
I find you very attractive.
It's just that you're a Blue Ribbon and I'm not.
So...
Wait a second.
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's bad, wrong. Wrong, bad.
It's not bad. It's... Jesus Christ.
I have to go home.
I have a big physics test tomorrow.
After extracting the implant...
I tested its integrity to the optic nerve, and it was intact.
The chip is functioning properly.
But I did find that excess stimulation to the pineal gland... caused the dopamine levels to go through the roof.
Every time one of these kids gets a hard-on, they beat somebody with it.
We could do a cingulotomy.
No. Cut a craniotomy flap.
I'll get elbow deep, see what happens.
- What?
- Cut the bruises out of the banana.
What about her parents?
Tell them she'll be missing cheerleading practice this week.
Look. Cook's Ridge trash.
Once you've all settled in,
I'm sure she'll fit in just fine.
- Thanks, Dr. Caldicott.
- Did you hear that, Nancy?
Yeah, Mom.
Come on, let's go. I gotta sell this bud.
I got two customers left.
If this keeps up,
I'll be the 7-Eleven guy.
I'm gonna grab a smoke.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I saw you come down here, Rachel.
I just want to ask you something.
What do you want?
I just want to know...
It's me asking, not my friends.
Will you go out with me?
You're kidding, right?
Will you, please?
No, Chug, I won't.
Why not?
How about this?
You couldn't repulse me more if you were made out of shit and maggots!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You want to be that way?
- Stop it. I'll scream. I swear to God.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
What will happen if you do?
I'm a Blue Ribbon, baby. Team captain.
You're just a trashy, tattooed love doll.
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up the plate for Chug. Come on!
Fuck!
Stop it!
What you looking at, retard?
Wow.
I guess I just think you should try and fit in.
We're gonna be here for a long time.
You, me, Mom and Dad.
And Chip and Dale.
- What is this?
- What?
- Where did you get this?
- I got it at school.
They were handing them out.
We all got one.
- Go inside.
- Why?
- I said go inside!
- Spaz.
- We should talk.
- Yeah.
There's something you need to see.
Rae, Gavin Strick here.
Live and unplugged.
Guess if you found this, then you know.
Am I hanging with Trent and Robby... and the rest of the Robots?
God, I hope not.
I hit the vents tonight when I split up with Stevie Boy.
He doesn't believe.
I went back to school... and I overheard Caldicott talking to some wonk.
Mentioned "Bishop Flats Eleven."
Caldicott called them his children.
Then he freaked out on the guy and kicked him out of his office.
So, I figure something's up with that.
Keep an eye on U.V. For me, though I doubt they'll want him.
I doubt they're interested in the pigmentally challenged.
That's not their style.
I have to go get paranoid.
This is Gavin Strick... reporting live from The Reconstruction.
I pulled this off the AMA database.
Caldicott's last place of employment... was across the bay in Bishop Flats... at the Bellknop Psychiatric Facility.
He spent seven years doing neuropharmacology.
Mind control.
Next ferry's at 6:00.
- Bishop Flats?
- You down for it?
Razor.
Let's go.
- I miss Gavin. He's almost like a...
- A brother?
Yeah, exactly.
I had a brother.
Sorry.
His name was Allen.
He was a couple years older than me.
If he had made it through his teens, he would have been amazing.
But he was always in pain.
And eight months to the day he shot himself...
Dad said we were moving to Cradle Bay... where everything was gonna be all right.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.
Let's go.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Think of it as our first date.
That's why my toothes are clean.
Be pretty... and do it just right.
Children.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide among the flowers.
Shut up.
Let's get out of here.
It's Caldicott's daughter.
His own daughter.
How can nobody not know there's something fucked up in Bishop Flat?
Shit, his own daughter was in there.
Nobody's safe.
The last ferry leaves at 11:30.
Tell me you have a razor plan.
- I am making this shit up as I go.
- Great.
Shit.
Hi, Officer Cox.
Closing time, Frankie.
Yeah, it's getting late.
Just be cool.
It's past curfew.
She's driving me home.
- From?
- Studying.
Where are your books?
- Evening, Officer.
- What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of rats.
The pink-eyed vermin can't see for spit.
Quarter a rat.
Town council gives me a quarter a rat.
I'm going to be rich at this rate.
I'll be on...
- "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
- Moron.
- Where are you going?
- Can we go now?
Step out of the truck, now.
- What are you doing?
- Hey!
Let her go! What do you want from us?
Get in here.
That's a big rat.
Come on, get out of there!
What are you waiting for? Get!
Let's get out of here.
Come on, Steve.
You have to trust me for now.
Do you trust me?
Where are you going?
I'm taking Lindsay away from here.
We're going back to Chicago.
- Don't do this. You're scaring me.
- I'm scared too, Mom, believe me.
Stevie, you have to know we're here for you no matter what.
- God, do you really mean that?
- Of course we do.
- Then let's all go home.
- Steven, you are home.
Cradle Bay is where you belong.
Here with your family.
You signed me up for the program?
- We want what's best for you.
- What about what I want?
Look, Steven, do you really like the way you feel?
Shut the fuck up!
You sold me out.
- We didn't. We just want you back.
- Steven, please...
My name is Steve, okay?
Nobody calls me Steven except for them.
Fine. Come on, Linds.
May I have this dance?
Where's Rachel?
She's gone to an institute of higher learning, Steven.
- Help!
- Everything's under control.
Who's your daddy?
Respect yourself, Steven.
Ice, ice, baby.
It's not what you think.
It's a new kind of cool.
You feel better, freer.
I've never felt so alive in my life.
- It's humanity's sacred essence.
- A new and finer age.
Go forward.
Be the ball.
People will know when I get out of here.
That's right, they will know.
They'll know because you'll be better.
Adolescence is a minefield.
But soon, you'll be fully equipped to walk right through it.
Yeah, straight A's and a letter jacket.
And every now and then, you rape and kill.
To cure cancer, you gotta kill a few white mice.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide among the flowers.
That's a battle I didn't win.
You'll be different.
I know so much more now.
She wasn't that bright to begin with.
Be all that's good.
Stop fooling around.
Let the light in.
Be excellent.
You're number one. You're an ace.
Achieve.
You'll be okay.
Going somewhere with my custard, Steven?
Let's go, Chug.
That's my girl you got there.
I can't let you take her.
Come on! Get up!
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up the plate for old Chug.
Come on.
- Not so fast.
- What?
What's the capital of North Dakota?
How the fuck should I know?
Okay, you're cool. Get in.
We gotta book.
Early bird ferry's in 20 minutes.
Shit, man.
It's time to leave mediocrity behind.
Step up on the bus.
What is it?
Come and get it, you blue bastards!
What is going on?
Come on.
Get them to the ferry.
I'll meet you down there.
Don't leave without me.
- Lunch boy.
- What are you doing?
We can't very well have these shitbirds... graduating and going off into the world.
Maybe they can be helped.
No, they can't. And neither can I.
Do good things, lunch boy.
Hey, teacher!
Leave those kids alone!
It's over, you son of a bitch.
It's finished.
"Finished"?
There will always be other towns... and other troubled teens... and other worried parents.
Science is God.
Be the ball.
- What happened?
- We're the only ones left.
So, what do we do now?
We go home.
And where's that?
Wherever.
Wherever we are.
Appropriate sparks are flying.
Somebody cue up the power ballad, man.
All right now, settle down.
Turn that damn thing off.
Now, y'all got a new student teacher starting today.
I want you to show him a little bit more respect than the last one.
Speak of the devil.
Say hello to your new student teacher, class.
They're all yours.
Peckerhead.
Hello, class. Welcome.
Be excellent.
Yes. Wonderful.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide in the flowers.
Treat yourself.
Subtitles By Captions, Inc. Los Angeles
No, Dolores!
Leave me be!
Let go of me!
Let go of me, Dolores!
Let me go!
Please, Dolores.
Got a certified letter here.
Never believe what happened down at the dock.
Dolores Claiborne, what the hell are you....
Oh, my God.
What have you done?
Put it down. Do you hear me?
Just put it down.
Jesus, Dolores.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
You killed her.
- So you lose the picture.
- Not happening.
It's half a page.
I'll let you write the caption.
- Come on, Peter. It's crucial.
- It's salad.
I'm setting up the whole campaign.
It's a better piece without it.
You already said it was brilliant.
I said it was wonderful.
- There's a difference?
- Yeah.
Half a page.
Fine.
I only left it in so you'd cut it out anyway.
I'm ready for Arizona.
Wait to see what I've got for the malpractice piece.
- The surgeon's ex-wife....
- Wait a minute.
Had her on the phone for 20 minutes last night.
- I haven't assigned you that story.
- You will.
Slow down.
Come on, Peter. There's a book here.
I deserve this.
Why does every story have to be do or die with you?
You're not the only writer here, okay?
I've got a dozen people out there to keep happy. You know that.
Great.
So now you're not only not fucking me anymore, you're fucking me.
What is it, Helen?
There's a fax here for Selena.
From Phoenix?
No, it's a clipping from the Bangor Daily News.
"Socialite Dead,
Housekeeper Held for Questioning.
- "Mrs. Dolores St. George of--"
- Where's the cover sheet?
Fax?
Forget it.
They're hardly out of the 19th century up here.
Are you kidding?
No, there's no motel. One restaurant.
They've got me sleeping on a cot in the town hall.
Tell him to relax. This is no vacation.
I'll be back on the mainland as soon as I wrap this up.
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'm looking for Dolores Claiborne.
And you are?
I'm her daughter.
I'm John Mackey.
- Detective, Maine State Police.
- Hello.
Would you please call
Constable Stamshaw?
- Get him to come right out.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
No smoking. Public building.
We've met before, Miss St. George.
Have we?
You were about 13.
What year was that, the eclipse?
Must have been, what, '75?
I was the investigator...
...when your father died.
We met at the hearing.
What's up, John?
Miss St. George is here.
Selena?
Oh, my gravy.
Frank Stamshaw.
Marshall's brother.
- Right.
- Jonesport High.
- Of course. How are you?
- It's been quite a while, I guess.
Certainly has.
To be honest, I'm kind of surprised to see you here.
Your mom's been pretty firm about us not trying to contact you.
- I didn't know Dolores made any calls.
- She didn't call.
I saw the Bangor paper.
It was faxed to my office.
And where's that?
I came up from New York.
Look, is she here or not?
- Yeah. She's right upstairs.
- Thank you.
But....
John?
Is she under arrest?
Technically, no.
Detective Mackey came out last night, and we're just getting started.
Started? On what?
We've scheduled an inquest for Monday morning.
It'll take the weekend to try and sort things out.
If she's not under arrest why is she in custody?
Right, okay. Vera Donovan is dead.
There's an autopsy in Machais this morning.
And you know...
...she died from a fall.
Your mother was the only person with Mrs. Donovan at the time.
That was her job, wasn't it?
I'm afraid, Miss St. George...
...there's a little more to this than what you may have read in the paper.
Dolores, what are you doing?
Straightening up this friggin' mess, is what I'm doing.
Gory, but this place is a dump.
Jesus. You're a suspect, you're not a maid.
Just leave that be.
There's someone to see you here.
I told you, I don't want no lawyer.
It's your daughter.
My God.
Look at you.
You cut your hair.
I didn't....
You call her?
Is that what you did?
- Jeezly crow, you got some nerve.
- She's here on her own.
Look at you.
I'm just....
My God.
Is it really you?
Look.
- Hey, Miss Claiborne!
- Kill anyone else today?
Not just yet. When I change my mind,
I know exactly where I'm gonna start.
- Go home.
- Where's the car?
Right there across the street.
I know you've been living at the Donovan house.
It's a crime scene now.
I got my own house, and you know it.
We'd like her to stay on the island for at least the next four days.
If I decide to make my grand escape to South America, I'll let you know first.
- I'd appreciate it.
- One last thing, Mrs. St. George.
Name is Claiborne!
I changed it back after Joe died, and you know it.
I'm very sorry, Miss Claiborne.
'Morning, Pam.
I'm sorry, but I think it's for the best if you got yourself some legal representation.
You're sorry, are you?
Bet the last time you were sorry was when you needed to use the pay toilet...
...when the string on your pet dime broke.
I'm just muzzying here, trying to think of what to say.
All grown up...
...looking so....
You turned out a beautiful woman, Selena.
I just can't believe you're here.
That makes two of us.
I'm sure there's a reason for why you'd go out of your way...
...to antagonize them like that.
Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto.
Nice car.
It's a rental.
You pay by the day or by the week?
I assume that's your way of asking how long I'm staying.
Good gory, you're more nervous than I am.
I have to be in Phoenix on Monday.
It's a big story. I'm trying to get out of it, but it may not be possible, all right?
I didn't kill her.
I didn't push her down that friggin' staircase.
That's what you want to know, ain't it?
Well, I'm telling you.
I did not murder that bitch any more than I'm wearing a diamond tiara.
He's got an eyewitness...
...who puts you standing over a dead body with a rolling pin.
So when did you start smoking?
Are you not listening to me?
They're talking murder here.
You're lucky I didn't have to post bail.
Spooky, ain't it?
Can't stand out here all day.
What a mess.
A regular bunch of artistes.
Look at this mess.
Cheese and crackers.
Friggin' little bastards.
I've got an idea who they are, too.
Let me try.
Selena.
Get in the house.
Selena, I said get in the house, right now.
I am in the house.
It's cold, I know.
God, it's a dust bowl.
Thank God I kept the electric up.
I got some wood.
We'll have hot water pretty quick.
Clean linen is upstairs, last I looked.
Longer you stand there, the more boogery it's gonna feel.
It's dead.
It's off three years, at least.
I'd know that if I called more often, right?
You called Vera's last Christmas.
The lines go both ways, Mother.
Look, this isn't gonna work.
I need a phone.
I'm gonna stay at the motel.
It's closed.
It's off-season.
What about Riner's Inn?
He's gone.
Burned down.
Must be five years ago by now.
Shit.
There's phones in town.
- We've gotta go shoppin' anyway.
- I'll go.
Alone.
I'll take care of it.
You don't know what we need.
I'm assuming it's everything.
You know what? I've got a game.
Let's count by fives. You want to play hide and seek? Ready?
Where is she? Where did she go?
I can't find Selena anywhere.
I hear an awful lot of thunder upstairs, but I can't find Selena anywhere.
Where is she?
Is she lost?
What was that I heard?
What did I hear?
I don't know. I think I heard something.
There you are.
Let me help you. That's my job.
- You must be starving.
- All these calls.
Ended up longer than I thought.
Water's warm.
You'll want a nice, hot bath. I got this.
I spent an hour tracking down this goddamn radiologist...
...just so that he could tell me he won't go on record.
Is that your new story?
You say there's hot water?
Why don't you go on up and get yourself fresh?
Go on.
It won't bite you.
Must be a lot of pressure.
All them famous people...
...talking to them.
I framed the picture.
You and Richard Nixon.
He was selling a book.
I got a scrapbook.

Drugstore in Jonesport puts them aside for me.
I used to read them to Vera...
...when she was clear enough to listen.
You've done so well for yourself.
Is that what you think?
How well I've done?
Hell, even Miss Vera Kiss-My-Back-Cheeks
Donovan couldn't help but be impressed.
The look on her face the day you wrote that first picture-on-the-cover story....
You would've thought she passed a brick.
Maybe you ought to slow down.
Believe me, I know my limit.
Don't that sound familiar?
I'd leave it alone if I were you.
I've seen my share of drunks, is all.
That's all I'm sayin'.
What did he have to be happy about?
I suppose making sure everyone else was as miserable as he was.
Is that why you killed him?
Oh, tough question, I guess.
Occupational hazard.
Don't feel too bad, Ma.
I asked Jean Harris the same thing once.
Let's face it, Mother.
We barely know each other.
We haven't spoken in years, and that's as much your doing as it is mine.
You didn't kill Vera, great.
You've got nothing to worry about.
If you did, then you deserve whatever comes.
Just...
...let's not pretend we're in some goddamn
Norman Rockwell family reunion here.
I'm sorry, Ma, but that's where we are.
And as for Dad....
The few memories I have of him...
...I'd like to keep.
Are you listening to me?
Daddy.
We made tapioca!
Get out.
We did. And it's not instant either.
And with real cream.
And the next thing you'll tell me is you made it just for me, right?
Oh, McCrea, there's that St. George smile.
- Don't you look just like my mother?
- That's enough fooling around.
Tell her she's got homework to do.
You better do your homework.
Theo called about the chain winch.
He's got them parts sittin' there.
Says he'll go as high as $250.
I changed my mind. I ain't sellin'.
It's not worth $100. You said so yourself.
He's got those boats in dry dock.
He needs the damn thing.
Ain't that the point in AA, helpin' out your buddies?
"Helpin' out."
Shit.
Besides, if I get that thing runnin', it's worth $250 a month.
Goddamn it! The soda's warm!
I only got home a half hour ago.
It went in first thing.
It's hard enough drinkin' this stuff cold.
What's so fuckin' funny?
Your pants.
They're split clear the way up.
Well, ain't that a scream!
You're pretty goddamn frisky all of a sudden, Dolores.
Let me guess. I'll bet that Vera Donovan's got a whole freezer full of soda.
Take them off. I'll mend them after supper.
What's the deal?
You kiss that rich summer ass all day long, you got nothin' left for me.
Just remember, your father used to scrape my old man's boat...
...so don't be gettin' high and mighty on me.
If you still had the boats, we wouldn't need the extra money.
Looky here.
A big old smily moon.
This is just for you.
Want to see the dark side?
Yeah, I guess it is pretty funny.
I hope you haven't been walkin' around like that all day long.
Why the hell'd you make me do it?
Fourteen times four equals 28?
Go on.
Sure it is. It's 14.
It's not!
You take 14...
...you bend till it snaps in half....
Could I have another, with raisins?
Not till after dinner.
- You were right about that real cream.
- He loved the raisins.
He said it's my best ever.
Mom, the cabbage.
Move it off the heat for me, will ya?
I'm just....
I'm just resting here a minute.
That's right.
She run her mouth off till she got tuckered out.
Plum tuckered out.
Mom?
Do you want me to set the table?
That'd be nice. Thank you, dear.
Stay tuned now for Walter Cronkite.
Each girl is representing a lifeguard station up the length of Alquinin Beach.
"Algonquin," you goddamn flylander.
Damn it, that better not be one of my mother's dishes.
You ought to take a look at this.
You might want to see what an ass is supposed to look like.
Them guys on the boat...
...always talking...
...everybody saying what a looker you are.
You know what I do?
I come right to your defense.
I say, "Shit, she may be ugly now, but you should've seen her when I was drinkin'."
My mother warned me you'd let yourself go.
Fat ass, lousy cooking...
...running that goddamn mouth--
Guess what, Joe? I ain't tired anymore.
You better sit back down, if you don't want this in your head.
Mommy?
Go on back to bed, honey.
Your father and I are just having a little discussion here.
Is everything all right?
Yeah.
Isn't it, Joe?
Right as rain.
You go ahead, honey.
Go on back to bed now.
Daddy?
Go on.
Oh, bitch...
...ain't you gonna get a payback.
Go on. All I ask is that you do it quick.
Don't let Selena see the mess once it's over.
You want to run me down?
You go right ahead.
You can be as mean and hurtful as you want.
But this is the last time you will ever hit me.
You do it again...
...one of us is going to the bone yard.
Well, make yourself useful, woman.
Bring me a towel for my head!
I'm bleeding all over my goddamn shirt!
That was one lesson he got the first time.
Maybe the only one.
It's been a long day.
You must be tired.
What do you want me to say?
"Thanks for sharing?"
Been looking all over for you.
It's as cold as Christmas.
What are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
Catch your death out here.
Tell me about Plan B.
I want you to tell me you've got a plan, Mother.
If it's about money, it shouldn't be.
I've got my sociable security.
I can still work. I don't need much.
What you need is a lawyer.
These guys don't say "get an attorney" unless they mean it.
It's you I'm worried about, Selena.
Let's not get off track here.
You're my daughter.
I know that probably feels like something better left alone, but it's true.
You're still my Selena.
You're still my good girl.
I can't help but be worried for you.
My God, your hands.
Scary.
I guess if you want to know somebody's life...
...you look at their hands.
That's what 22 years of Vera Donovan will do to you.
Mrs. Donovan, I promise there won't be any boys.
You're excused, Susan.
But Mrs. Donovan, please! I love--
Look on the bright side, dear.
You may not have gotten the job...
...but think what fun you'll have telling your friends...
...what a bitch Vera Donovan is.
Next!
I've been working since I was 13 years old.
Started by housekeeping in a hotel.
By the time I left there and high school...
...I was cleaning three floors all by myself.
I took care of my father's house after my mother passed on.
I'm married and I have a daughter.
This is a big house, but I'm a big woman, and I think I can do a good job.
I do not pretend to be an easy woman to work for.
Dolores.
This house has a number of rules.
I'm sure you've heard them secondhand.
But I'll tell you in person...
...so we can avoid a teary scene later on.
I like all the windows open every day for at least two hours....
She did have her ways, did she ever.
I don't know where she got her ideas, but I do know she was a prisoner of them.
The silver has to be checked and...
...cleaned every week. It may look clean to you, but I like to see my face in it.
The tubs had to be scrubbed out every day with vinegar and baking soda.
Tablecloths, napkins, handkerchiefs...
...everything hand-washed, ironed and starched.
Mildew was grounds for firing.
The sheets.
Now, that was one thing you didn't...
...ever want to get wrong.
You could've cut off her high-flown snobbish nose...
...and she'd still smell a sheet that had hung outside...
...from one baked in the dryer.
Excuse me, Mr. Donovan.
Do you have to do that now?
Talk to the Missus.
Her husband...
...Jack.
He only came up once all summer.
Most of which he spent ignoring her anyway.
She could've just as easy had the clothesline beside the house.
But not Vera Donovan. No, ma'am.
She had to have the south wind blowin' through her linens.
And that meant trampin' up and down that hill twice a day when it was fair.
Isn't this glorious, Jack?
Six pins, Dolores!
You know that's the way I like it.
Six pins, not five!
Jack?
It's 4:30.
Don't you want a cocktail?
Three square meals of bitchery all summer long...
...but I kept my head down and my mouth shut.
Every week that $40 went in the bank.
There wasn't a damn thing she could say about it.
Thanks a lot.
As much as she crabbed that whole summer...
...I must have done something right.
Come Labor Day....
I'm sure your winter schedule is rather hectic...
...but I need someone to touch up the house once a week.
Dusting.
Keeping the mice company.
I could do that for you.
$12 a week was...
...what I had in mind.
That'd be fine.
I'll see you next Memorial Day.
That winter, Jack Donovan passed on.
He died in a car crash in Maryland.
I wasn't sure what to expect from Vera.
Gory if she didn't show up in high spirits.
I believe I told you more than once...
...I want the welcome mats with the letters facing out and not in.
Yes, ma'am.
She'd sold her place in Baltimore.
She was moving up permanent.
Get that out of here and put that there.
And take away this disgusting sofa.
It took two days to load in her majesty's palace.
She offered me full time and I took it.
I took it.
I knew what kind of hell it would be.
Hell ain't something you get thrown into overnight.
The real hell comes on you as slow...
...and steady as a line of wet winter sheets.
Snot leaking off your nose.
Your hands so cold and raw...
...you start wishing they'd go numb.
It's only December.
You know by February...
...the skin's gonna be cracked so bad, it'll break open and bleed if you clench a fist.
But you go on to the next...
...and the next and before you know it, those sheets stretch out 20 years.
Nobody made you stay there.
- I needed the money.
- Not in the beginning, not $40 a week.
That's when I needed it the most.
Not for me, for you.
That's perfect.
So it's my fault.
You think your father cared whether you ever got off this island?
Here we go.
I put that money...
...every week, I put it away in your account...
...for school.
To get you out of this place, once and for all.
Well, it worked like a charm.
Hello, ladies.
A little morning walk?
Nope.
Just packing up the speed boat so as I can make my big escape.
Something we can help you with?
We need a hair sample.
How was that?
We need a piece of your hair.
We're running some tests.
- Are you now?
- Just a strand.
I think we'll take a pass on that.
Look, Dolores...
...right now it's voluntary.
I'd appreciate it, is all.
Bring your scissors, did you?
I said we'll pass.
I'll have a warrant here this afternoon.
You want it...
...you cut it.
Actually, I need to pull it.
We need the root.
Go on.
Take what you want.
I ain't doing any beauty pageants this week.
- Anything else?
- Mother, enough.
We spoke to Sheila Jolander last night.
She said she'd heard you on more than one occasion threaten to kill Vera Donovan.
Is that true?
If she'd come every day instead of once a week, she'd have heard plenty more.
- Get in the house.
- Vera, at the end...
...the way she got, it's a wonder
I didn't say it every hour.
You go ahead, Mr. Mackey.
You scribble that down in your pad there.
You make a note on that.
As long as you write down that saying a thing and doing it...
...are two separate things.
But then, your wife probably already told you that.
Dolores, that's enough.
My wife...
...Miss Claiborne...
...died 12 years ago of bone cancer.
Natural causes.
Okay, I guess we'll press on here.
Frank.
I want to get into Vera's.
I got things up there I need.
Clothes and my personals.
We can go over tomorrow. We're shipping out Vera's body this afternoon.
Fine by me.
What the hell did I just see?
That's the last guy in the world you want to make an enemy out of.
I ain't making one, I'm keeping one.
What is that supposed to mean?
You're gonna tell me you don't remember him?
That's all well and good, Miss St. George...
...but you told me that at the time of your father's death...
...you were working as a maid in a hotel at Jonesport.
Yes.
Well...
...Mrs. Devereaux...
...at the hotel.
Remember?
Mrs. Devereaux said...
...she was surprised to see you.
She said your mom was pretty strict about not letting you spend the night there.
Isn't that true?
I guess.
So why did she let you stay on that particular weekend?
Problems at home, perhaps?
Your mom and dad...
...is that a happy situation?
Miss St. George?
The eclipse.
Because of the eclipse, the hotel was full.
So the money....
They said that we'd make twice as much.
So this was all about money?
My mom let me stay.
They said that we'd make twice as much.
So your father...
...that was just a coincidence, was it?
My God, how long are you gonna let this go on?
The sooner this girl starts telling the truth, the sooner we'll be done here.
If he's out to torture somebody,
I'd be happy to get back in the hot seat.
Anybody who's gonna accuse me of killing my husband, go ahead and call me Dolores.
Detective Mackey, you understand, he's just doing his job.
Trying to turn an accident into a murder?
Making a girl who just lost her father cry her eyes out every night?
If that's just doing his job then you'd better put him down for overtime.
All right, let's split them up.
Slow down, John.
Five minutes, alone, without her.
Enough, John.
I only need five minutes!
I said, "Enough."
So don't be talkin' to me about makin' enemies.
No, sir. No, ma'am.
That son of a bitch has been waitin' a long time to pick over my bones.
Hand me that ax.
Just look at this window, little piss squirts!
I ought to call their parents and have them come over and pay for it.
Now I gotta go buy glass and...
...putty and God knows what else.
Could have burned down the whole goddamn house.
I thought the malpractice piece was your most important story.
If you'd left your number
I'd have called yesterday.
Yeah, right. Look.
The radiologist I told you about...
...he got cold feet.
But the intern, Levitt...
...he's a talker.
I thought you were going up there to see your mother?
It's a small domestic drama up here, Peter.
I can be in Phoenix Tuesday.
It'll be over Monday.
These family things, I've been through it.
They take a lot out of you.
I am telling you, it's not a problem.
We both want me to do this story.
I'm out of here Monday at the latest.
You want a wet dream?
Wait till I tell you what Levitt said.
Are you there?
I gave the piece to Maureen.
Look, I'm sorry. I couldn't wait.
The magazine has to be first on this.
It has nothing to do with you, you know that.
So, I guess you're fucking Maureen now?
Nice try. Come on, Selena.
You couldn't tell me to my face, could you?
Look, I never promised you--
You goddamn pimp.
- Careful.
- I need this story, Peter.
There are other stories, better stories.
Bullshit. This was the one.
It's over.
Selena, it doesn't have to be--
I'll do this again.
Shouldn't you be off somewhere analyzing my mother's hair?
Well, I was thinking how hard it must be for you.
Protecting her like this.
She's a hearty soul, isn't she?
Might just live another 50 years.
Next eclipse is due in '96.
If she gets away with it this time...
...she might actually have another chance to...
...kill again, before she's through.
Is that something you want on your conscience?
I had a problem with that myself.
You know, we're probably more alike than you'd care to believe.
We live alone...
...no children.
We have our work.
My cases are my family.
In 30 years, I've handled 86 homicides.
I've closed 85 of them...
...to my satisfaction.
I underestimated your mother.
It won't happen again.
You sent that fax to my office...
...didn't you?
"For God shall bring every work into judgement...
"...with every secret thing...
"...whether it be good or evil."
You son of a bitch.
Vera Donovan's on my head.
The next one's on yours.
You know, Selena...
...I can't help remembering...
...you were a wonderful cook.
Please.
You were.
I can't even defrost.
You put supper on the table three nights out of five.
I was working. I'd come back.
You'd have the house clean, your homework done and food on the table.
You're just out of practice, that's all.
You'll find someone to look after.
You'll see.
It'll all come back to you.
Someone to look after.
You must have boyfriends.
Beautiful girl like you, smart and out in the world.
Are you tellin' me there's nobody?
I'm telling you there's a lot of nobodies.
Friggin' yahoos.
Come on out here, Dolores!
Friggin' little bastards.
Get off the island, you goddamn murdering bitch!
Come on down here, you little ass-picking squirts.
Come on! Come on, you little chickens!
Going to jail this time!
I know who you are.
Chester Lavelier and the rest of you.
Come on down here.
You got something to say to me?
They're gonna put you in the chair!
What are you doin'?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Selena, you've been drinkin'.
No shit.
I wish you wouldn't.
Look at me.
Look at me. You see how I am right now?
What good is that gonna do?
Because in ten minutes...
...I'm going to be fine.
Just give me ten minutes.
Just give me ten minutes!
God!
I saw your father last night.
Did you help your ma kill your dad?
Who is this?
You fat, ugly cow!
You know when I find out who this is,
I'll hang your privates from Battiscan Light!
Selena, stop that!
Honey, it's gonna be all right.
It won't.
- My God!
- Get away!
It was a bad patch.
You had a bad patch, and now you're feeling it all over again.
Bad patch?
I had a fucking nervous breakdown,
Mother.
Don't say words like that.
It was a hard time. You got through it.
Oh, what am I doing?
You just needed a rest, that's all.
You snapped out of it just fine.
You can't have one of those things...
...and get a full scholarship to Vassar College.
It was just a bad patch.
I must have been out of my mind to come back here.
Here! Over here!
What did you do to him?
Nothing, baby. I promise.
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
Selena, let me take these from you here.
Dolores, I'll take you upstairs.
I'm gonna ask you to...
...step very carefully on the way up.
Still taking blood samples here.
If you feel more comfortable,
Miss Claiborne...
...you can always use the back stairs.
John, is it all right if we go upstairs and get her things?
Go on.
I'm sorry.
He got a search warrant, so I...
...had to go through it for evidence. Yep.
It's pretty routine.
Okay, let's get this over with.
So....
You can pack up and take anything that's not...
...bagged or tagged.
I know that doesn't leave much.
Sorry, Dolores.
I'll give you a hand here.
Dolores, is that it then?
No. I got something in Vera's room.
This room's off limits.
I'm still going through things here.
Miss Claiborne.
What's this then?
It's my scrapbook.
It's Selena's articles.
I'd read them to Vera.
Almost got away with it, didn't she?
I read that. That's good stuff.
You really got him to open up there.
Scholarship.
Vassar.
Very impressive.
Jeezly crow.
Couldn't you even clean up after her?
- What kind of people are you?
- You put that back!
You're gonna tell me this is evidence?
- That's exactly what I'm telling you.
- Dolores, you put that down.
Goddamn it!
I'm tryin' to do you a favor here and that's the way you act?
I ain't leavin' here without my scrapbook.
Sorry, John.
I'll see you a day after tomorrow,
9:00 a.m. at the town hall.
Don't put your fur up, Frank. I'll be there.
I have a feeling we could wrap this up right now.
It's not gonna be like last time.
Is that so?
Let's just go. Okay?
Now you listen to me, Mister Grand High
Poobah of Upper Butt Crack.
I'm just about half past give a shit with your fun and games.
My husband's death was ruled an accident and you know it better than anyone.
Death by misadventure, to be exact.
Ask around.
I'm sure there's people who'd tell you...
...I had plenty of reasons to kill Joe.
But Vera, why the hell would I kill her?
All I am is out of a job...
...a nice room to sleep in.
You don't need a job, do you?
Motive?
I'd say one million...
...six hundred thousand dollars...
...is quite a motive.
What?
Your mother's a wealthy woman, Selena.
What the hell are you talkin' about?
I spoke to Vera's lawyer in Baltimore last night.
John.
- She left you everything.
- But, John--
Every last cent.
She can't do that.
You're lyin'.
You're a millionaire, Miss Claiborne.
Wait a minute.
- This isn't the place to be bringing--
- Back off.
He's crazy.
That's plain crazy.
She'd never do that.
Did she keep it a secret from you, too,
Selena?
Or maybe you knew about it.
Because this will....
I mean, hell...
...it's only eight years old.
Frank!
You want to wait for the District Attorney
Monday morning?
Or should we take care of this now?
Get in the car, Mother.
Get in the goddamn car!
You had no idea she left you the money?
I swear it.
Over a million dollars.
That bitch. The malicious, high-flown, harpin' bitch!
Cut the bullshit!
You can afford a lawyer now.
Car trouble?
We're quite fine, thank you.
I wish I had killed her.
Leavin' me that money.
I wish I had!
I wish I had killed her!
What happened in that house?
Dolores.
Hell's bells.
Look who's up.
I'm wet.
What else is new?
How long this time?
Since you last made sense?
About two days, I guess.
Just leave me wet, don't you?
When I'm not thinking straight enough to keep on you.
That's what you do...
...isn't it?
Yeah, it's a regular party around here when you're snoozin'.
Where's my china pig?
There's only 200 of them around.
Which one you want?
Are you being smart?
No, Vera. If I'd been smart, I'd have done workin' for you a long time ago.
Let's see what you got left.
Goddamn it! Are you gonna sit here and marinade in it? Come on.
You're gonna get on this fanny pan one way or another.
Come on.
There we go.
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.
Now hold on with your good arm.
Hold on this time.
Push with your good leg.
I don't know why you make me do this.
I hate this nightgown.
Your days of silk and satin are over, Vera.
From now on it's wash 'n' wear.
You're poisoning me...
...aren't you, Dolores?
Slow...
...but sure.
That's what you're doing.
No, ma'am.
When I get ready to settle your hash,
I won't bother with poison.
I'll just shove you out the window. There'll be one less smelly bitch in the world.
Don't we have a hair...
...across our ass today.
Dolores Claiborne.
I want my china pig!
Get off your royal duff and go over there and get it.
We both know you can do it.
Do you good.
You need the exercise.
What I need...
...is someone who'll do as they're told!
Don't go too far, Vera.
I'll go as far...
...as I damn well want!
Yes.
I will!
If this...
...is what's going to pass as living...
...I'll damn well say what I want!
"Oh, this little piggy had champagne.
"This little piggy ate beans."
I'll fix you some tea. You'll feel better.
No!
I won't.
I won't feel better.
I never will.
I'll never feel better again.
Oh, my God.
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my way, Dolores.
Where do you think you're going?
What in God's name has gotten into you?
Let go of me, Dolores!
Leave me go!
Oh, my God.
Don't try to talk.
I'm going to go call the doctor.
No doctor.
No hospital.
You're gonna be all right, Vera.
You just lie still, don't move.
You're gonna be fine.
Dolores Claiborne says I'm gonna be fine.
What a relief it is...
...to have a professional opinion.
Why?
Why'd you do this, Vera?
- Why?
- Because...
...I hate...
...the smell of being old.
I'm tired...
...and I want to be done.
Will you help me, Dolores?
Will you please...
...help me die?
Don't let me die in some hospital.
Kill me now.
If you really want to help me...
...please hurry.
Dolores, got a certified letter here.
You don't believe me, do you?
You think I killed her.
What I think doesn't mean shit.
It's the rest of the world you better start worrying about.
I made a list of attorneys.
These are all the big muscle firms in New York.
Now, it could take a couple of days, that's why on Monday...
...you're not gonna say a word.
Take it.
In case you missed it,
I'm trying to help you.
You think I give a fiddler's fuck what anybody else says about me?
Oh, Jesus.
It's you.
What you think is the only thing left that's important.
I can't send you to prison.
You think that's the end of the world?
Gory, that'd be a relief.
Sit and sleep...
...three meals served every day.
Maybe you're just happier being miserable.
Is that it?
Is that it, Mother?
If it makes it easier for you.
Vera's a bitch. She's abusive, she's mean, she's cheap.
Why not leave?
Why not just walk?
Like they do in New York?
Someone hurts me...
...I leave.
Believe me, I learned that a long time before I got to New York.
I'm not the one that hurt you.
What is that supposed to mean?
You're blaming him?
Is that what we're into now?
He was a drunk.
Barely got out of his own way.
Fine...
...maybe he hit you.
I don't remember it.
You don't seem to remember much of anything.
But then, he's not exactly around to defend himself, is he?
You honest to God don't remember, do you?
Look.
Here's the goddamn list.
You do what you want with it.
That's why you're so unsettled, ain't it?
Unsettled?
Don't you mean "boogery," Mother?
If you're attempting some sort of meaningful analysis...
...perhaps we'd best define our terms.
It's a cornerstone of critical thinking...
...communicating with an agreed upon vocabulary.
Go have another drink.
No, I've had my fun for the night.
You sit down right this minute and you can just stow that Vassar shit.
We're gonna sit down at this table, you and me...
...and we're gonna have us a drink.
When we're through....
When I'm through...
...you can run upstairs and take whichever of those little pills makes you feel the best.
Don't say a goddamn word.
Before you get too deep in that to make sense...
...take a look at her report card.
I saw it.
So what?
Everybody slips now and then.
Can I be excused?
Not till you tell me how an honor roll student...
...who skips the whole seventh grade...
...goes from straight A's to C's and D's in two semesters.
Will you leave her alone already?
It's not like you were some great genius at school.
No, Claiborne wasn't even born in a hospital, for Christ's sake.
May I please be excused?
No, you may not.
Yes, you may. Go right ahead, dear.
Thanks a lot.
You better learn to stow it.
You'll drive her right out the door.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Thought you and I might ride back on the ferry together. You mind company?
Beautiful, ain't it?
You used to be beautiful too.
Why ain't you anymore?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
It's drugs, ain't it?
You've changed.
You're 13 years old, you're smoking pot.
Where do you get it from?
How long's it been going on?
I don't do drugs, Mother.
Whatever trouble you're in won't change my love for you.
I can't begin to help you out of it till you tell me the truth.
Are you pregnant?
Get real.
You want to end up like me?
Dumb and stuck?
Think I push you so hard in school to stay in a uniform...
...and clean up after people your whole life?
Is that what you want?
I'm not pregnant.
Then....
What is it?
What the hell's going on with you?
- Leave me alone.
- I'm not gonna leave you alone.
We'll ride the ferry back and forth all day till you tell me...
...what's wrong.
Leave me be!
- Why won't you talk to me?
- Don't touch me!
What?
Stop it!
I got you.
Get off of me!
What is the matter with you?
Talk to me!
Where did you get this?
What're you doin'?
This is your grandma St. George's cameo.
- It's mine.
- What did you do?
Did you go in your father's closet?
Oh, Mom, please....
- Selena, did you steal this?
- Let go and give it. It's mine.
Oh, my God.
As you can see, Mrs. St. George...
...this account's been closed out by your husband.
How can that be?
That's my life savings. How can that be when I got the passbook right here?
You see, Mrs. St. George, that is...
...was what we call a custodial savings account.
That means either parent can countersign and make a withdrawal.
This doesn't show any withdrawals.
How'd he get the money without the goddamn passbook?
Mrs. St. George...
...if I could ask you to keep your voice down.
According to this, your husband stated,
"Passbook was lost."
He asked to be issued a new one.
It's common enough.
Common be damned.
I opened this account!
Who the hell do you think put the money in the bank to begin with?
Please, Mrs. St. George.
I'm sorry, but I assure you that what we did was not only legal...
...but standard bank practice.
Maybe it's legal and maybe it ain't.
I can't believe standard bank practice means you don't make...
...one single goddamn phone call...
...to the person whose name and number is on this account.
I'm very sorry--
You say you're sorry once again, I'll kick your butt till you look like a hunchback.
Lydia.
It's 'cause I'm a woman, ain't it?
If I'd been the one passing off a fairy story how I'd lost the passbook...
...and asked for a new one....
If I'd been the one who started drawing out what took 11 years to put in...
...you would have called Joe.
Well....
I suppose it's one of two things.
Either he's buried it in a mason jar in the backyard, or else...
...he opened up a new account.
Mr. Pease....
I know you don't have to tell me, but I'm hoping you'll think for a moment...
...about the grief and heartache you could have saved me by making just one call.
I'm asking you to please tell me whether he's opened a new account here...
...or if I've gotta start digging holes around my house.
As soon as the luncheon silver is clean,
I want the guest rooms aired out.
I'll want to go over the linens for the daybeds in the study...
...and the sun room.
No, Joy, I don't like those colors together.
Change them.
Dolores, did you check on the flowers?
Must you look so trod-upon, Dolores?
In 36 hours you will have the uniquely thrilling experience...
...of standing at the epicenter of a total solar eclipse.
I've got guests traveling 800 miles for something all you need to do is look....
Did you see Dolores?
As soon as the caterers arrive, I want you to make sure they have everything needed.
I've made a list.
I want no last-minute frantic runs to Jonesport.
Do you hear me?
Would you put on some tea?
- Are we quite finished?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Donovan. I truly am.
"Vera."
I insist that all women who have hysterics in my drawing room...
...call me by my Christian name.
So, enlighten me, Dolores.
What turns a stone-hard woman like you into the blubbering mess I see before me?
Joe stole my money.
I went to close out my account....
It was money I'd been saving for Selena.
Three thousand dollars.
I went to get it out and it was gone.
Well, don't look to me, Dolores.
All my money's tied up in cash.
Planning on playing the stock market, were you?
I was going to leave.
I was going to take Selena away with me tonight before he gets back.
Well....
Isn't that dramatic.
And why, exactly, are we running away?
Well, go on, Dolores.
Perhaps it's not as bad as it seems.
Give it to me. It's mine!
Oh, my God.
It's your father, ain't it?
He's been at you, hasn't he?
What are you talking about?
- What's he done to you?
- Nothing!
- He's been touchin' you, hasn't he?
- No!
What's he done to you?
You've gotta tell me the truth.
It's important.
Leave me alone!
You bitch!
You crazy old lying bitch!
You're a fucking psychotic.
- You think I'd make up something like this?
- This actually comes to you?
- How can you not remember?
- I remember you hitting him!
That I remember.
I remember the blood on his face, the drinking, the fighting, but this?
- You're not responsible.
- Mackey's right. You are dangerous.
- Fuck you!
- You gotta believe me.
No, I don't.
Don't try and stop me.
I'm going to the hotel.
Mrs. Devereaux needs extra help for the eclipse.
- I'll be back in a few days.
- We talked about this.
I don't care what we talked about.
I don't want to be here when you talk to Dad about your crazy ideas.
Come back here right now!
Just leave me alone!
For 12 hours sleep, you don't look so good.
I need to be in Arizona.
It's a big story and I need it.
I know.
I packed your things.
You had stuff lyin' around.
Coffee's on the stove.
What is it?
It's Detective Mackey's report. Here.
I don't want it.
How remarkably brave, Mother.
I'll make some calls.
You'll have your phone turned on tomorrow.
I'll take the report.
I'm gonna fax it to a lawyer.
You can expect a call tomorrow.
And when you talk to that lawyer,
Mother...
...you damn well better do what he says.
You'll miss your ferry.
You want to hang yourself?
Go into that inquest tomorrow and start shooting your mouth off.
I'm sorry, Mother.
"Sometimes being a bitch is the only thing a woman has to hold onto."
Shit!
I hope I'm doing this right,
'cause I never worked one of these before.
Don't these Japanese make the cunningest little gadgets?
You're sleeping now, Selena...
...but I know when you get up, you're gonna leave.
By the time you hear this,
I figure you're in Arizona.
By now it's all been said and done.
You can forget about the lawyer.
I'm gonna go down tomorrow and talk to those people and...
...I ain't makin' a stink about it no more.
I'm telling you now what I'm gonna tell them.
I just thought you ought to hear it firsthand, is all.
How far has he gone, Dolores?
She says it ain't never happened.
And she screamed and cried and denied it so bad, I know it's true.
I should've....
The way she's been acting around him,
I should've known it sooner.
My God.
How far has he gone?
He wasn't always like this.
When we started out it wasn't a dream come true--
Has he fucked her?
I don't know.
I don't know.
But if he hasn't, he's gonna soon enough.
He's working the boats.
He'll be back tomorrow.
That money....
I was gonna use that $3,000 to get us as far away from here as possible.
And how far is that, Dolores?
Jonesport? Bangor?
You've never been more than 50 miles away from this island in your life.
How long do you think it would take him to find you?
It's a depressingly masculine world we live in, Dolores.
Maybe I'm wrong.
What if you're right?
Husbands die every day, Dolores.
Why...
...one is probably dying right now, while you're sittin' here weeping.
They die...
...and leave their wives their money.
I should know, shouldn't I?
Sometimes they're driving home from their mistress's apartment...
...and their brakes suddenly fail.
An accident, Dolores...
...can be an unhappy woman's best friend.
Don't you just love the bossa nova?
I found them in New York.
I just had to have them.
Hi, how are you?
There's a buzzer going off in the kitchen.
You'd better check it.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Donovan.
We're going as fast as we can.
Oh, please.
Everything's charming.
I heard on the radio they're callin' for rain.
Oh, don't worry.
I'll have my eclipse.
I'm sending you home, Dolores.
You've done a wonderful job and it's all under control.
I want you to go and share this remarkable experience with your husband.
He will be back, won't he?
I suppose so.
I've got you two eclipse viewers and two reflector boxes.
I thought you and Joe might like them.
I can't.
Sometimes, Dolores...
...sometimes you have to be a high-riding bitch...
...to survive.
Sometimes...
...being a bitch...
...is all a woman has to hang onto.
Thank you, Vera.
Now, go on home.
Pam and Sheila can clean up.
Remember...
...eclipse at 5:00.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
I got some binoculars.
I'm going to find myself a good spot.
Come on!
You sorry piece of shit.
What the hell are you doing back?
Got the afternoon off.
Welcome home to you too.
Don't start with me, Dolores.
Where's Selena?
She's working at the hotel.
Looks like you bought out the whole store.
What's all this?
A present to celebrate the eclipse.
Eclipse, shit.
I've been feeling so good lately,
I thought I'd share some of my happiness.
What do you got to feel happy about?
Well, Jesus Christ.
You don't want it?
I can always pour it down the sink.
Vera sent us some thingamajigs to watch the eclipse.
Yeah, like I give a shit.
I don't want to fight with you.
Let's just try and enjoy the day.
That won't be hard.
That crowd. Looks like D-Day.
Look at them.
The whole goddamn island's out there.
I hope it rains.
Hope it comes down so hard it drowns them all.
What the hell has gotten into you?
Ain't nothing gonna happen any more than a thunderhead going across the sun.
Eat up, Joe, before the flies beat you to it.
Okay, here we go.
Hey, Dee!
Isn't this what all of you and all the rest of them fools been waiting for?
Better get your butt out here.
Goddamn.
She's disappearing, all right.
I got another surprise for you.
Did somebody invent a pill that'll cure ugly?
You know the money in Selena's bank account?
Yeah, well, what about it?
You took it.
Don't you look sour.
- I guess it is pretty funny, ain't it?
- Yeah.
I fooled you right and proper, didn't I?
You fooled me about a lot of things, Joe...
...but I guess I finally caught up with you.
You already spent $500 of it.
What'd it go for, Joe?
Poker?
Beer?
There you go, selling me short.
It was set aside for school.
You blew all our money, you might as well run through hers, while you're at it.
Ah, school, shit.
You can't even wipe your ass for three grand these days.
I spent the day with the people at the bank.
It turns out you weren't supposed to do that.
Lie to them.
Make them break their rules.
What did you go and do?
I got all that money given right back to me in cash.
All but the $500 you pissed away.
So you can just go and fuck yourself.
That is if you can get that limp old noodle of yours to stand up.
I told you what would happen if you wouldn't leave off being fresh with me!
Didn't I?
You believe me now, do you?
Yes. Yes, Joe!
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
A star.
A star.
You'll see plenty of them if you don't start tellin' me where that money is.
Right now!
I buried it...
...in the yard.
Out by the field.
Let's just go get it back where it belongs, why don't we?
Believe you me, there better be every last cent of it.
You'd better save the big talk for your pals at the barber shop!
I wonder if they're gonna think you're such a stud...
...when they find out the only ass you can get your hands on...
...belongs to your 13-year-old daughter!
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?
Then how come you look like the devil just grabbed them little raisins you call balls?
She's a liar. She's a little liar.
And a goddamn tease.
How could you do it, Joe?
After everything I did for her...
...she's mouthing off like that, telling lies like....
When she gets back I'm gonna get my belt.
I'm gonna get my belt.
The only thing you're gonna get is a long stretch in Shawshank Prison...
...for child molesting!
Goddamn bitch!
The more you run, the worse it's gonna be.
Get off me!
You're gonna get your payback now, bitch.
And it's gonna cost you more than money!
You're mine now!
Give me your hand before I fall all the way in, please!
Help me before I fall all the way in, goddamn it!
You don't know what you're doing.
Where are you going?
Oh, God, what're you doing?
Dee, come on!
Where are you going? What are you doing?
Please!
You bitch!
I swear, you're gonna die.
Help, somebody!
Somebody help me, please.
Help!
Help, somebody!
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Nobody can hear you.
You bitch! Oh, you just better hope
I don't get out.
The eclipse lasted six and a half minutes.
They said it was some kind of record.
It was a hell of a lot more than a thunderhead passing across the sun.
It was beautiful.
I burned the dress...
...and I dropped the whiskey bottle out near the well.
I started askin' folks if they'd seen Joe off on a bender somewhere.
Other than Detective Mackey showing up and making trouble...
...it was easier than I thought.
That's what happened...
...plain and true.
And I don't care no more who knows it.
I guess all I do care about...
...all I ever cared about...
...is that you're safe and sound.
I lied to you.
And I lied to myself.
Now it's time to pay the piper.
There we go.
One coffee, $1.
Out of five.
Okay, one coffee, one hot cocoa, that'll be 60 cents.
McCrea, it ain't worth half that.
There you go.
You look cold enough to climb inside a clam shell.
Here, this'll warm you up.
What's the matter, you don't want it?
It's hot chocolate just for you.
Come on, let's take the top off.
You got that little thing I give you?
Let's have a look at it.
You know, this is very special, Selena.
My mother got it from her mother.
You know, I'm not gonna give it just to anybody.
It's very special for you, okay, sweetheart?
Here.
Take that.
It's a very special thing for you.
Your hands cold?
I'm okay.
- Here, give me your hands.
- I'm fine.
Nobody's gonna see us, sweetheart.
Here. Come on. Give me your hands.
My cocoa will spill.
Oh, gosh.
I'll buy you another one.
- Come on, let me dry your hands.
- All right.
Oh, gosh. Your hand's cold.
I can't.
I can't.
No, Daddy, please.
Come on, now. You know how to do it.
I showed you.
Remember how I showed you?
Nobody's gonna see us.
Come on, baby. You remember?
You remember how I showed you?
Please.
Come on.
Come on, that's it.
Oh, that's it.
You're my good girl.
I love you, Selena.
You're my good girl.
You want your change or what?
No. You keep it.
I was gonna kill her, Your Honor.
She tried to do it herself...
...but she was still alive.
She begged me to finish what she started.
I didn't know if I could do it or not.
By the time I got back from the kitchen she was dead.
Just your good luck, I guess.
They tell me you've waived your right to council.
Yes, sir.
I can tell you, I've married people who've brought lawyers with them.
Let's just get this over with.
Before I sign Detective Mackey's report...
...there are a few things
I'd like him to clarify for me.
Miss Claiborne...
...I have several witnesses...
...who say they were present when you threatened the life of Vera Donovan.
Now that's true, is it not?
Why don't you just go ahead and ask me what you really want to know?
In due time, Miss Claiborne. In due time.
- Is it true you made those threats?
- Of course, it's true.
She told you herself on Saturday.
I'm sorry. This is a closed hearing.
The woman sitting over there, the one without a lawyer, that's my mother.
This isn't a trial.
I have every right to be here with her.
Selena St. George.
Don't stop. Let's just wrap this up and get back to the mainland.
This report is incomplete.
Maybe before you sign off on this--
We're in the middle of a questioning here,
Miss St. George.
My mother did not kill Vera Donovan.
That's funny. I've got 30 pages here that says she did.
This thing is totally circumstantial.
I've covered enough courtrooms to know he's got no hard evidence here.
Circumstantial? Samuel Marchant, page 6!
Why don't you tell him what's not in the report?
You've had the whole weekend to get yourself a lawyer.
What is it that's not in the report?
These two women loved each other.
Oh, really?
Now that's something we'd like to hear.
That's something...
...we definitely missed in our investigation...
...isn't it, Frank?
Why don't you tell us about this great mutual affection?
Your personal observations.
How'd they get along when you'd visit?
Christmas, birthdays, holidays...
...whenever you could tear yourself away from your judicial reportage.
Why don't you tell us, Miss St. George?
When was your last visit?
Miss?
Fifteen years ago.
You must have some memory.
These women were together for 22 years.
My mother spent the last 10 years caring for Vera...
...24 hours a day, 365 days a year...
...for $80 a week.
Maybe you oughta quit while you're ahead.
He says they hated each other.
I want to know if you hated each other so much why you stayed together?
There were other jobs...
...better jobs.
Why go through 20 years of hell?
- Why, Mother?
- Please, Miss. This is embarrassing.
You're supposed to be a professional, aren't you?
We know I never visited.
Who did?
In the past few years, who else has been in that house?
Doc Collin came once a month.
Let's not forget Sammy Marchant.
Nobody else gave a damn whether they lived or died.
All they had was each other.
That's why you stayed together.
I mean, really, is that what you do when you hate someone?
You trade off your life for...
...what is it, 20 cents an hour just to keep them going?
Please, all this is very touching.
But $1,600,000...
...is a little more than 20 cents an hour.
My mother never knew about the will.
Come on, Miss St. George.
The will is eight years old.
You were there, Frank.
You were there when Detective Mackey told her about the will.
Do you think she knew about it?
The constable's not on trial.
Neither is my mother.
Constable?
She seemed pretty surprised, I guess...
...to me.
That's how I saw it.
You want us to believe that they were best friends...
...and alone for eight years and they never even talked about it?
I think people can keep secrets a lot longer than eight years.
A $1,600,000 secret?
Come on!
Did you know about the will,
Miss Claiborne?
No, sir.
Vera made it pretty clear she was plannin' on takin' it all with her when she went.
I figured when she'd passed on there'd be some laundry to do and a fare-thee-well.
Isn't that convenient?
You don't believe her?
Then I tell you what, Detective.
We may be in the presence of a truly gifted criminal mind.
For eight years she's a heartbeat away...
...from being the richest woman on the island.
So what does she do?
Does she wait one year and let Vera drown in the tub?
Spend three years starving her?
You're only digging yourself in deeper.
Smother her in her sleep?
Drug her?
My mother's plan is far more brilliant than that.
She waits through eight years of bed pans, sponge baths, diapers and bed sores.
She waits eight years until Vera's already got one foot in the grave.
And then what does she do?
- We know what she did.
- That's your theory, isn't it?
She waited eight years to throw her down the front stairs.
Yes. To make it look like an accident.
An accident? She ransacked the kitchen for a rolling pin.
Calm down!
How is beating Vera to death going to look like an accident?
She panicked, just as you're doing now.
Sammy Marchant brought the mail every day at noon.
- Why not wait till midnight?
- She panicked.
- She knew she had to finish--
- How do you know what she knew?
Fourteen years' experience.
- You've never been wrong.
- Not when it counted.
- That's right, you're 85 for 86, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
- One case away from a perfect record.
- This report is the truth.
Truth? Bullshit! Why don't you tell him why we're really here?
Go on.
Tell him.
Because she's done it before.
Wait a minute.
Is there some prior felony here, John?
No, there's not.
They wouldn't indict her.
Eighteen years ago...
...my father drank some scotch...
...and fell down a well.
Detective Mackey didn't think it was an accident, which is...
...why we're here today.
What do you think, Selena?
I think that I owe you an apology.
I called you a son of a bitch.
You said you thought we were a lot alike.
And you were right.
We've both spent the past 18 years prosecuting this woman.
We came out here...
...I know I did...
...believing she was guilty.
We forgot this case is about Vera Donovan...
...not my father.
And what if it wasn't an accident?
Look...
...it's been 18 years.
I don't know what this has done to you...
...but let me tell you, it's consumed me.
I have lived with this every day of my life.
Every day.
But it was wrong...
...and I won't do it anymore.
And if I can say that, my God...
...can't you?
She didn't kill Vera Donovan.
You've been out here all weekend looking for a smoking gun.
There isn't one.
All you've got is a 30-page description of a suicide.
I'm asking you...
...as an honorable man...
...with all of your experience...
...all that you've seen...
...would we be here right now...
...if this was anyone other than
Dolores Claiborne?
This report's the truth!
I'd like you to know that if you go to trial with this, you'll fail again.
You'd better ask yourself how you want to finish your career.
I've got a long list of New York lawyers...
...who'd just love to take you and this case apart in front of a jury.
Mother....
Come on, let's go.
They can't hurt you anymore.
John?
This is your ball game.
I'm gonna leave this up to you.
Come on.
It's time.
Even when it's warm here, it's cold.
It won't be like that in Arizona.
There is no Arizona.
I don't have to go.
It was a lie.
My editor...
...the story, the book...
...it's all over.
Do I still have to worry about you?
I don't know how to feel about what you did.
Maybe I never will.
But I know you did it for me.
I don't want to lose you again.
Go on.
You're not gonna lose me.
You go on.
You promise to watch the game and not be bored...
...and I'll go to the opera next week.
I already bought earplugs.
With your eyesight
I'm surprised you can see the puck.
Yay. All right!
I can't wait to get into bed.
- There's a Bob Hope movie on television.
- I know.
Do you believe this guy? Killed 12 victims. Dismembered and ate them.
- Really? It's an alternative lifestyle.
- Yeah. I'll say.
- Hold the elevator!
- We're coming.
- Hold the elevator.
- That's all right.
- I see you at the gym sometimes.
- You do?
- We live down the hall.
- I go whenever I have the discipline.
- It's important to put that time in.
- I agree.
Exercising changed my life. Just...
I prefer to atrophy.
I don't like exercise.
- We bought a treadmill last week.
- We had one.
We got rid of it because it was taking up space.
You have to get on it once in a while.
It's confusing with all those computerized programs.
- I'm just never going to get that.
- I know.
- Wonderful meeting...
- Well, yeah.
- You never meet your neighbours.
- Isn't it funny?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Such a lovely couple.
- Oh, say... Hello?
- Yeah?
Why don't you come in and have a drink? We'd love that.
- That'd be fine.
- She makes great Irish coffee.
- Please.
- There's a movie I want to watch.
- Give me a treadmill lesson.
- About the tread...
Listen, if I can figure it out, then believe me, anybody can.
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- It's easy.
- Let's look. I'm at level five.
- You're that advanced?
I work out a lot.
Look at these diagrams.
That's amazing.
- I can't understand this.
- Let me see.
Yeah, well. See this?
Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail.
Very rare and very beautiful.
Look at that.
This is unique because it has a flaw in the engraving.
- See if you can see it.
- It's hard for me.
- I'll give you a hint. In the corner.
- That tiny thing?
Yeah. That makes it quite valuable.
I got a commemorative set of issues that are valuable. Look at the colour.
- These are gonna become...
- We're keeping you up.
- No, this is wonderful.
- I should go.
- What do you do?
- Book publishing. I work at Harper's.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I own an old cinema. Having it redone.
Used to have three.
Business is not what it used to be.
Look at these presidentials.
Even the perforations are intact.
- Where's Carol? I should be going.
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean...
- Coffee's ready.
- I forgot coffee.
- We can get back to this later. Come on.
We never had any children but it's easy to empathize.
- What college does your son attend?
- Brown.
Nice colour.
Paul never attended college.
He's self-made.
Knowledge is the second most important thing.
First is health. Then knowledge.
Then money.
- It's amazing how time...
- Do you work?
- Do I?
- Yes.
Well, actually I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago.
But I've been thinking of starting a restaurant.
- Really?
- But Larry is trying to talk me out of it.
She's a great cook. Her fennel omelette in hollandaise sauce...
...will make you snap into a foetal position and lay in bed.
He loves to tease me.
Actually, he really loves exotic food.
My weakness is dessert.
Cream, butter, anything with fat.
I'll fix a dessert that'll make your eyes roll. You'll have to exercise for a month.
We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.
- 28 years in November.
- Really?
- What do I buy a woman with everything?
- We already have twin cemetery plots.
I always think a Bentley is in good taste.
On our 20th, I got her some lovely handkerchiefs.
- They had my initials on them.
- Very high-class.
I didn't even know her size.
Couldn't you keep the conversation going longer?
- I was signalling you.
- I was trying to be neighbourly.
Neighbourly? If this guy showed me his stamps one more time...
My favourite thing is to look at cancelled postage.
Come on. It was sweet. They're looking forward to their anniversary.
I'm looking forward to that Bob Hope movie. I don't know why it's on so late.
- Do you think that will happen to us?
- What?
That we'll become like them. Just another dull, aging couple with our walks...
We are a dull, aging...
...our TV, our lox and bagels and our twin cemetery plots?
We should be as lucky.
To be in their shape at their age.
Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts?
If I lifted them I'd get a hernia the size of the San Andreas Fault.
- How often do you think they make love?
- More than we do, in their shape.
I'm sure as much as once a week.
- Larry?
- God, I'm exhausted. What?
Do you still find me attractive?
What kind of question is that?
Of course I do.
Are we turning into a pair of comfortable old shoes?
Never comfortable.
Don't you worry about that.
- How you doing?
- Fine.
- We're gonna get this one.
- That's nice.
Are we seeing you at Elaine's Thursday?
No. Thursday's our Wagner opera.
- Ted's coming to Elaine's.
- How is Ted?
- I think he's glad he's divorced.
- He's not. Come on.
He's not doing well at all.
He's not used to it.
He looks like he's glad.
- You gonna browse?
- We're going to a movie.
- We're seeing Double Indemnity.
- Come.
- What do you think?
- It starts in a while.
I'd have the police after her so fast, it'd mak e her head spin.
They'd put her through the wringer.
The things they would squeeze out.
They haven't got a thing to go on.
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience and this hunk of concrete in my stomach.
- That movie was great, wasn't it?
- It's one of my favourites.
- They were wonderful.
- Who could we fix Ted up with?
- There must be somebody in your office.
- Ted?
- I thought Ted had a crush on you.
- Me?
- Why are you so stunned?
- I adore him, but he's like a girlfriend.
- Now he's divorced, you know?
- Do I detect a note of jealousy?
- I had to come and call 911.
- What's the trouble?
- Is that the EMS?
- What's going on?
- She had a heart attack.
- Oh, my God.
- She's dead.
- She's dead?
- Dead.
- They're giving Mr. House a sedative.
She was the picture of health.
- I called EMS, but it was too late.
- We just met her last night.
- Awful, just awful.
- What happened?
It was a classic coronary.
She went like that.
- Boy.
- Can we do anything?
You can be good neighbours.
We've calmed him down.
The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them.
- They invited us in for coffee.
- Such a nice lady.
Sweet person.
- God, okay.
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. House. So sorry.
- Thank you for those flowers.
- It was nice.
- Sure.
- If there's anything we can do...
- Anything.
It's just such a shock.
It was just so sudden.
- She seemed so healthy.
- She had a heart condition.
She did? She never mentioned it.
- Well, she wouldn't have.
- No. Right. Well...
- lf there's anything we can do.
- Anything.
If you're lonely, come by. Whatever.
- You owe me a French dessert.
- I haven't forgotten. Believe me.
- Have a nice time. You're gussied up.
- We're going to the opera.
- Enjoy.
- My favourite.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Come, we're gonna be late.
The deal was, I sit through the game and you watch the opera.
I can't listen to that much Wagner.
I start to get the urge to conquer Poland.
I think it's weird. One night she's having coffee, and the next she's dead?
I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go.
Maybe he killed her.
Like he's got a young tootsie.
You gotta see this guy.
This guy gets his jollies from licking stamps. He's a boring...
I can see that. Depending on who is on the stamp.
She never mentioned she had a heart condition.
Well, what is she gonna say?
"Hello, I have a bad heart."
She told me about her hysterectomy.
It's easier to talk about a hysterectomy than a heart condition.
She liked desserts.
Is that what you said?
So she had one too many.
No! She wasn't on a diet.
We discussed diets.
- She wasn't on a diet.
- This is a great way to kill somebody.
- How?
- You clog their arteries...
...with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter. They go like that.
- That's great.
- Disgusting, but...
I love it.
- Wouldn't that be great?
- I'd like to pastry myself to death.
- I'll help you.
- I would.
I'd like another piece of pie, after this.
Are you gonna start a restaurant?
Are you serious?
- You're a great cook.
- Count me in. I want to be part of it.
- Really.
- Really?
- You should.
- No. I don't know. Are you serious?
- It'd be wonderful.
- What are you encouraging her for?
- She's a great cook.
- Thanks to you.
It was his idea.
The cooking lessons, I mean.
A restaurant is serious business you can't take lightly.
- You can't be cavalier about it.
- I'm not being cavalier.
Do you know how time-consuming it is?
- Wait. Look.
- They steal from you if...
- It's what I do.
- She'll cook. She's great. She's a pro.
She'll be cooking. I'll be running the joint like Rick in Casablanca.
- Might as well get paid for it.
- I'm serious.
- It's serious.
- I'll be the first customer.
I was thinking of fixing
Ted up with Helen Dubin.
Then I figured they would get into an argument over penis envy.
- The poor guy suffers from it so.
- Did he seem a little too cheerful?
He seemed like his regular self to me...
...but when you brought up the restaurant, the guy lit up.
The restaurant?
He sees himself as
Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.
I see him as Peter Lorre, wringing his hands.
I mean, Mr. House. Didn't he seem a little too cheerful to you?
- Our next-door widower?
- Yes.
I mean, didn't he seem too composed for a man whose wife just died?
What do you want him to do?
Walk down the street sobbing?
All I know is they were supposedly looking forward to their anniversary...
If I dropped dead, wouldn't you sob for months or years...
Don't make those jokes.
I don't like them.
I'm the guy who needs a physical checkup.
I don't know. To me he seemed a little too perky. You know?
Suddenly, he wants his desserts and,
"Have a nice time at the opera."
And, "We're certainly dressed up."
This guy should be a wreck.
Right. Meanwhile, I can't get The Flying
Dutchman theme out of my mind.
Remind me tomorrow to buy all the Wagner records in town and rent a chain saw.
Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.
- She's mousy.
- He's a little mousy.
They can have rodent time and eat cheese together.
Oh, Christ.
Hello?
Yes. Yes, yes, of course, you woke us.
Not everybody is up at 1:00 in the morning watching porn. I'll put her on.
- Who is it?
- Ted. For you.
Ted, hi.
I figured out how he made it look like a coronary.
He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill...
...and turned it up to Olympic levels.
No, no. You know, I mean,
I just think this guy is too perky.
You know? I mean, he's not acting like a man whose beloved of 28 years died...
Are you onto that?
I thought you were joking.
- I know.
- Let me speak to him.
What? Here.
Just a sec. Here's Larry.
Listen, she was not murdered.
It was a coronary, there was a doctor there. He was an old man.
- Do you know he's a real doctor?
- I'm not gonna touch that.
I want to go to sleep.
Wait a minute.
Put Carol back on.
I called about something else.
Listen, I know a great location for a restaurant.
Look at this.
Isn't this great?
- It's dark.
- Aren't these walls great?
- Like you go through a cave.
- I see.
- Then you come out to this.
- Look at this.
- It's beautiful.
- Isn't it great?
- It's out of the way for a restaurant.
- No. That's the appeal.
It's so romantic, tucked away back here like this.
You don't want street trade.
You want a spot people hear about and lovers go to.
- It takes months to get a reservation.
- You thought this out.
I came here with Julie when we were married.
Used to walk around here.
- Really beautiful at night.
- I bet.
I'd think, "Why are we here?
We don't love each other."
It made the moment doubly poignant.
Hi. How are you?
These are my "floating islands."
I hope you like meringue.
- I love it. Come on in.
- Well, okay.
- Unbelievable.
- I know...
- Did you do this?
- I did.
I told you.
Anyway, this is vanilla sauce.
Come on in.
- I put chocolate truffles...
- Share it.
- She made these for you.
- It's too much.
- I'll make coffee.
- I'll make it.
- Let me make it.
- You've done so much.
I insist. Sit down. Relax.
Enjoy yourself.
- Aren't you nice.
- You've been through enough.
- How're you holding up?
- I don't know.
I was thinking after a while, I'd get away. This place and its memories.
- You have someone to go with, or...?
- A brother in Florida.
I'm hoping he can get away.
Do you like snorkelling?
No. I get nervous when brightly coloured fish stare at me.
- I've got stamps to show you.
- Stamps? Well.
Look at these.
Okay.
Coffee. Is that here?
- This is delicious. You are an artist.
- Well, thanks very much.
- Was it a large funeral?
- Oh, no.
- We had few friends. No family.
- Right. Just a simple affair.
- They're the best, aren't they?
- Yeah.
I guess. Anyway, then you're laid to rest and...
You know, I was just...
Where are the twin cemetery plots?
We were thinking that that was just such a romantic idea. Weren't we?
Remember when we talked about the twin cemetery plots and how romantic that is?
- Remember?
- Yes. Yes. We were.
Spending eternity with the beloved.
- I sound like one of those guys.
- Yes.
Yeah, but I was just wondering, where is the cemetery?
It's in Nyack.
We used to summer there occasionally.
What was that about twin cemetery plots?
I knew you were trying to tell me something, so I picked up on it quickly.
I was in the kitchen making the coffee.
There were no beans, so I was looking in his cupboards.
And I came across this urn, okay? And
I opened it and there were ashes in it.
- Ashes? Did you wash your hands?
- He had her cremated!
How did you know it was her?
Did they resemble Mrs. House?
- Who else would it be?
- Anybody.
Could be a relative.
His accountant. His cat.
- Right. Hidden? Hidden away?
- What do you mean?
- The guy didn't do anything.
- All I know is, he lied. Okay? He lied.
Maybe he's embarrassed.
Maybe he didn't want to spend eternity next to the beloved.
So he told us that.
You know, what's the difference?
- Who are you calling?
- Ted.
Jesus. Leave the guy alone.
He's a poor widower. He wants to go on a vacation or something.
Yeah? Where? I know where.
Snorkelling, right?
So what? He has fun sitting at the bottom of the water with squid.
I know. I know. What about this?
- What if they had a big insurance policy?
- Too much Double Indemnity.
Hi. Yeah. Hi, it's me.
We were just in our neighbour's apartment, right?
Get this. I came across an urn with ashes in it.
Only, he says he had his wife buried.
That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy.
You don't want something discovered.
Like poison.
Right. They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they?
I don't know.
There are a lot of exotic poisons.
But why would he lie?
Why would he lie at all?
You guys are slipping into a mad obsession.
Would you do that?
I'm not good at that kind of thing.
All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
- Could we go to bed now?
- I'm not tired.
- What do you mean?
- Ted's gonna call the funeral home.
I don't know why you're not fascinated with this.
- We could be living next to a murderer.
- New York's a melting pot. Get used to it.
Oh, my God.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Larry. Larry, I heard a noise.
I heard a noise in the hall. I think
Mr. House was getting on the elevator.
- You sure?
- I'm almost certain it was him.
So what? It's not a crime.
He can get on the elevator.
- Who would at 1:30 a.m.?
- I was in a deep sleep.
What's the difference?
You know how we complain about the geriatric floor? That joke?
So it was him. He got on the elevator.
It's not a felony. He's entitled.
Can you go back to bed?
This is crazy.
- I gotta get up early tomorrow.
- I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna ring his apartment, see if he's home.
- Now?
- Yes, because this is...
- What?
- It's very sus...
- What are you doing? Don't ring...
- Don't!
Don't ring Mr. House. He's a widower.
Leave him alone. You're crazy. Stop!
- So you saw him. It's not a crime.
- He's not there.
- Give me this.
- What are you doing?
If you want to find out who left, call downstairs.
- I'll call. Keep ringing.
- I'm gonna keep ringing.
What's gotten into you?
Where is this guy at 1:30 a.m.?
It's not your business.
He can go any place he wants.
Hello? Yes, hello.
This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes.
Did anybody just leave the building?
I'm just...
You're sure? You're sure no one...?
No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you.
- Are you happy? Can we go to bed?
- I don't get it.
You're making a mystery where nothing exists.
Okay, I got it. Wait. I know it.
No, wait. Listen to me. Larry, listen.
- He got on the elevator. Wait. Listen!
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
I don't want to stand here.
He got on the elevator and took it to the basement.
- Great. So what? Now what've you got?
- He has a car and the garage key.
- He opened...
- So what? So what?
What do you mean, "So what?"
He went out in the night and took his car someplace.
- All right. So I'm right, though.
- So you're right. So big deal.
This "right" is gonna put us in the toilet.
- It says more about you than him.
- What about your rigidity?
- How about that point?
- Get into bed. What's wrong with you?
Hi.
Jack? Could you come upstairs today?
I got a leak in the kitchen.
- Well, yeah. Sure.
- Well, but it will be this afternoon?
- I'll be back in a minute.
- A minute.
- Wait a second. I'll be right back.
- Yeah, okay. All right.
Oh, God.
- Hello?
- Ted, I'm in his apartment.
The urn is missing. It's gone.
Yeah, I think it might have been.
He had this satchel last night.
That might have been what he had in it.
I'd get out of there if I were you.
No, no, no. Go.
We'll talk more from your apartment.
He's not going snorkelling with his brother.
He's got two tickets to Paris and reservations at the Georges V Hotel...
...with a woman named Helen Moss.
- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?
Good. You got the notice on the maintenance increase?
When did that happen?
I'm gonna see what else I can dig up.
Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just...
I'm just dizzy with freedom.
This is the craziest thing
I've ever done.
Yes, it's crazy. But soon we'll be too old to do anything crazy. Go. Leave.
Hello.
Oh, hi. Yeah.
I know, I...
Yes, I miss you too.
I did. I made all the arrangements.
Yeah, look, I...
Okay, I have to run.
But I'll see you later, okay?
Okay.
Extension five.
Keep ringing, would you please?
Because I just talked to her.
What?
Okay.
Would you tell her...?
Yes, tell her that Tom called.
Tom.
Thank you.
Your rewrites were great.
You helped your book. It's dense, but...
- I don't want it to be transparent...
- You'll never have to worry about that.
This book makes Finnegan's Wak e look like airplane reading. But it's long...
You're the only editor I take suggestions from, but you shouldn't push it.
I'm not pushing. The book is absolutely great. You know, but...
How much of Dorothy is you?
As I read, I kept thinking, how much did you base on your life?
Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film critic.
But not a blackjack dealer?
No, but I put myself through school playing poker.
- Do you still play?
- No, but I still know how.
Yes? Are you good?
Maybe you could give me pointers.
I could turn your game around in two hours.
Could you? That's great.
That's, you know...
You have all these skills and you're beautiful and you can write well...
...and you play poker.
It's too good to be true.
- I wouldn't say beautiful.
- I would.
But I do have tremendous sex appeal.
Okay. You sold me.
Are you seeing anybody?
No. Don't let my confidence fool you.
It's a façade. Why do you ask?
I have a friend who became single recently, and he would get a kick out of you.
So when do you want your poker lessons?
Next week. I could take you to lunch.
We could...
I'll put you on my expense account and you could teach me when to bet or fold.
- How about a cheeseburger right now?
- Now? That's a possibility.
You know, we could...
Hello?
Yes.
Where are you?
Is everything okay?
Really?
No, I could. Sure. I could.
Yeah. I need, you know, five minutes or so. Okay.
Yes, I know where it is.
Okay, hold on.
I can't do it. My wife...
I have a thing I have to do.
I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week.
Story of my life.
You snuck into his apartment?
Are you nuts?
- Stop being a fuddy-dud.
- A fuddy-dud?
What are you talking about?
That's a crime.
That's breaking and entering.
What has gotten into you?
Save a little craziness for menopause.
I took the key and I let myself in.
Hey, look...
You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti.
You can't just steal a key and go into somebody's apartment.
He's not going snorkelling with his brother.
I don't want to be an accessory.
He's going to Paris with a woman named Helen Moss.
- Tell Ted. I don't want to know.
- I did.
- You told Ted before me?
- Yeah, he's more open-minded.
I know. I'm a bore. I don't break the law. I live within the Constitution.
- Plus, he got rid of the urn.
- I don't want to hear.
- He talked on the phone with a woman.
- How do you know?
- He came back while I was there.
- He did?
- I hid under the bed.
- Under his bed?
He didn't see me, Larry.
He didn't see me at all.
I cannot believe this.
My stomach is curdling.
He was very lovey-dovey with this kind of bimbo.
He kept saying stuff like, " Don't worry.
It'll be all right. We'll be together."
- What if he found you?
- I couldn't think that far ahead.
That far ahead?
You're talking two seconds.
Yeah, but Larry, listen to this.
He called this woman back.
Probably this Helen Moss.
I don't want to know.
And when he calls her back, she's not there.
Then he leaves this message and says:
"Tell her Tom called."
You know what I'm saying? Tom!
I get it. His name is Paul. But I don't care. I don't want to hear.
I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted.
A private eye couldn't have done better.
I put everything back where I found it.
I was careful. I made one mistake.
- What?
- I left my reading glasses on his table.
I thought I'd bring chocolate mousse.
I know you enjoyed the last dessert.
I thought I'd give you another something delicious.
Do you want me to serve that?
You should while it's fresh.
- We can all have some.
- That'd be great.
- I'll get plates.
- Good.
- That's great.
- Over here. I put them here somewhere.
How are you doing in there?
You need any help?
- No, I'm fine. I'll be right in.
- Okay, great.
No. You're going to ruin everything.
What are you doing?
- Are you okay? Can we do anything?
- Coffee or tea?
- I'd like some tea.
- You know, I found your glasses.
- Mine?
- Are these yours?
- Yes! No, no, no.
- Those aren't yours. These are the same.
- These ones are.
- They are mine.
- What a coincidence.
- I think the other night I left them.
- I didn't notice.
- It was the strangest thing.
You thought I left them at your mother's house.
- Of course.
- That mousse looks fabulous.
- I love mousse.
- Thank you.
- Are you looking forward to snorkelling?
- Very much.
It's funny. I found those glasses under my bed.
I must have dropped them and they got kicked under.
- They were...
- She drops things and kicks them around.
- Mousse?
- I'd love some.
Remember when you kicked mousse under the bed?
- I remember.
- Took six months to get...
- Sorry I'm late. The traffic's murder.
- I know. Where are we going?
I looked up Helen Moss in the phone book. It was "H. Moss."
It's Bank Street.
We're going to do surveillance.
I got a whole lot of food. It's great.
- There's her house.
- Right. So we just sit and wait? Okay.
Maybe he thought if he divorced her, she'd hit him for alimony.
- Maybe she controls the family fortune.
- Yeah. Maybe we're wrong, Ted.
Maybe she died of natural causes like the doctor said and we have...
...hyperactive imaginations whose lives need adrenaline.
- Does yours? Mine needs something.
- What's that?
Jelly doughnuts.
You want a jelly doughnut?
- Come on. You gotta get into it.
- Okay.
- Oh, my God. Look. Look!
- What? What?
- Helen! Helen! Duck, duck!
- Ted! Oh, God.
Helen!
- It's not her.
- It's not her?
No, it's not her.
- What?
- Oh, God.
You really have this worked out, don't you?
I figured she'd come out and go to work.
Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like you and she has writer's hours.
I'm writing a play about something that happened to us.
God. Oh, dear. What?
Remember when you and I and Larry and
Julie were on that eating tour of France?
Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.
And they wandered off and forgot to pick us up?
We shared that bed-and-breakfast place.
Remember those wonderful cottages?
And I remember that we shared a bedroom together, right?
- Not a bed.
- No, not a...
Well, God, you were too gentlemanly to suggest that.
- It's not that I didn't think of it.
- No.
I knew what was going on because of the way...
...you kept plying me with Château Margaux.
It could have been our little secret.
Then you passed out.
Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?
Not that long ago.
Look. Look, look, look.
What?
- Helen! Duck.
- God, yeah. Right.
- She didn't see us.
- No?
- That's gotta be her. She answers to Helen.
- She answers to Helen. She's pretty.
- Yeah.
- She's...
- What is she doing?
- She's getting a cab. Keep down.
- Okay, don't worry.
- I'm gonna follow her.
Watch your step.
It's very steep. Be careful.
- This is beautiful.
- Isn't it?
We show revivals.
This week we have Fred Astaire.
Next we have an Orson Welles festival.
I think that will be about the last thing we do before renovating.
- Paul.
- Come on, there's nobody around.
Okay.
- I've never been behind a movie screen.
- Strange, isn't it?
It used to be a first-run house when the neighbourhood was better.
- All these mirrors.
- It used to be all mirrors. Beautiful.
I'm having this broken glass replaced as we go along.
They used to have stage shows here.
Now we only show old movies.
- It has such a lonely feeling.
- I'm the only one here. And Mrs. Dalton.
I'll have it fixed up.
Then I'll sell it.
- The money is gonna come in handy.
- It sure will.
- What's that noise?
- Where?
Mrs. Dalton, I didn't know you were here.
I didn't know anyone was here. I'm sorry.
- I heard a noise, but I apologize.
- It's quite all right.
I'd love to really get an acting job.
- I've had it with modelling.
- Maybe you won't have to work at all.
Oh, my God.
- What's the matter?
- Come with me, okay?
- Jeez.
- Come on.
I was asleep, dreaming of round card girls.
Okay. It looks like he's gone.
Yeah. Yeah, he's gone.
- Not that again.
- I want another look at his apartment.
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?
- He'll never be back, Larry.
- What?
- No, he's not coming back.
- You got his key?
- Yeah.
- You're kidding. You can't...
You followed him to the movie house.
You said nothing happened.
No, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money.
- Well, so what?
- That's the motive.
- Listen.
- What are you talking about?
- Wait.
- What do you mean?
You gotta go to your shrink.
I want you to see Dr. Ballard.
Larry, I went for two years.
You know how General Motors will recall cars?
- You gotta go in.
- We'll be out in five minutes. Five.
I'm your husband.
I command you to sleep. Sleep.
I command it. Sleep!
If this had been a few years ago, you would do the same thing.
Because if you recall, we solved a mystery. We solved a mystery once.
It was the " noises in the attic" mystery.
The country house. The bluebird.
That was a sweet mystery.
This is murder.
- You agree, right? It's murder, Larry.
- I forbid you! I forbid you to go!
Is that what you do when I forbid you?
I'm not going to be forbidding you a lot if you do...
- Damn it.
- Don't do this.
We should be asleep, in our cuddling position.
Please be quiet.
You're gonna wake up the neighbours.
- I got it.
- This is no good.
This could only lead to great unhappiness.
- Relax, okay?
- I can't relax. How can I relax?
I'm in a strange man's apartment in my T-shirt and pyjamas.
- Ted told me to try something here.
- Ted? What is he, your mentor?
- Ted is a sick schmuck.
- Just be quiet, all right?
- What if he comes back? My heart is...
- Larry.
- Waldron?
- Who?
- Who is this? Who do you want?
- Who's this?
- Do you know anybody named Waldron?
- Hang the phone up.
- Great. Now they hung up on us.
- Good, good.
Let me think.
Waldron, right? Helen Moss.
He used the name Tom.
Tom Waldron.
- We gotta run a check on that.
- You want to beat it to the morgue?
You got all the jargon.
Where are you going?
I'm not a night person.
I don't want to be...
I don't know what I'm looking for.
- Wait. Look.
- Are you gonna go through the guy's mail?
This is insane.
- What do you mean?
- Jesus! Oh, Christ!
- Clean it up. Hurry up.
- What am I gonna do? Vacuum?
- Put it under the rug.
- It's a wall-to-wall carpet.
- I broke his porcelain...
- Well, then, glue it.
- What do you mean, glue it?
- Look.
- What?
- Look.
So what. Gloves.
I have gloves.
Do you keep yours out in this kind of weather?
- Let's get out.
- Something's strange here.
He left these out.
The whole thing is sinister.
It's eye of the beholder.
You have to get happy glasses.
I'm gonna take the pieces.
We'll get rid of them.
- How did you like your birthday cake?
- I loved it.
- But I love chocolate anything.
- I know.
- What are you laughing about?
- If only he could stay in town.
They're working us so hard at school.
I gotta get back.
I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present.
She's going to a winetasting.
Can you believe that?
If I'm gonna be a restaurant owner,
I should know about wines.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- I want you to meet somebody.
- What?
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?
- This is my wife.
- Carol. Remember me?
- This is Marcia Fox.
- Hi.
- Good to see you.
It's his birthday, so we took him to 21.
Your friend called me.
He's taking me to dinner in New Jersey.
- I fixed her up with Ted.
- You did?
- That place we ate at.
- Lovely.
- You'll have a good time.
- Great.
- Well, good to see you.
- Take care. Goodbye.
- She'll have a great time.
- So that's Marcia Fox, huh?
- What are you making a face for?
- You think she's Ted's type?
She's anybody's type.
She's brilliant, talented.
- You know, your pupils are dilating.
- She's dangerously sexual.
When you go to the winetasting, getting back to real life, spit it out.
- Don't drink too much.
- What do you mean?
I don't want you on the bathroom floor with your head by the bowl tonight.
- That Mouton '45.
- Did you love it?
- That was like, sublime, you know?
- Yeah.
The inexpensive Spanish one.
Wasn't that a surprise?
Wasn't that great?
Look at these paintings.
- So...
- I love the blue in that.
- Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox?
- Yeah, well, you know.
He says she's wonderful. And I'm...
I'm trying to meet people.
I'm not looking forward to this.
- So you're taking her to Vincent's?
- Yeah. I guess.
- She's not my first choice.
- No?
God, look at this.
That park is so beautiful.
- I can't have my first choice.
- No?
- I'm drunk. I don't know what I'm saying.
- So am I. I don't know about this.
- I'm gonna be late for my shrink.
- You've gotta go?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You know, you would be my first choice.
- Me, huh?
- Yeah.
Well.
Oh, boy.
Can I give you a lift?
I'm gonna go east.
No, I think I'll stick around.
I feel a little tipsy.
- I didn't offend you by what I said?
- No.
You didn't offend me. No, I was very flattered by this, Ted. Flattered.
- Well, anyway...
- See you later.
- See you. Careful.
- Sorry. Excuse me.
I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers for Nick.
It's cashmere. Very expensive.
The kid looked so handsome in it.
I decided I'd cook tonight.
Tuna casserole.
- Well, no wonder he had her cremated.
- What?
Mrs. House.
You're not on about
Mrs. House again?
I thought we'd have a light dinner...
- Larry. I just saw Mrs. House.
- What are you talking about? The ashes?
A bus passed me and she was on it.
The dead woman passed you on a bus?
The bus to heaven?
I'm not joking. I'm telling you,
I really saw her. I actually saw her.
You wanna lie down for a while?
Cold compress or hot compress...
I was at the winetasting, right?
And I was sitting at a bay window.
I happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it, Larry...
Yes, remember I said to you, spit it out?
You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon?
You swallowed it.
That's why you're this way.
Yeah, I had a few drinks, but...
I saw her.
Yeah, I'm sure you saw her. How could you? She's dead. And cremated.
Are you telling me that
I didn't see her? Is that it?
I think it's a fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't turn up.
I just don't know what's happening, Larry.
What's going on? Let me put it this way.
Total psychotic breakdown. Okay?
Maybe she's a twin.
Now, forget this.
Tell me if I put in too much fudge in my casserole.
You're getting so close-minded these days. I just... Oh, God.
- Hello? Ted.
- Ted.
You're not going to believe this, but I saw Mrs. House.
Yeah, Mrs. House.
The murdered woman. Right.
She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary.
I don't know what she's talking about.
No, I'm sure I saw her.
She was on a bus.
I saw her just moments after you left.
Right. He was at the winetasting too.
Sure, why not.
Would you? Great. Run a check on Paul and Lillian House...
Don't run a check. Can you call back?
My marriage is falling apart.
If you're gonna have an affair, you don't need a murder to do it.
I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.
Yes, I know. On the dead persons' bus.
Now, sit down.
I can show you the exact spot, Larry.
- What about lunch? Tomorrow?
- No, I've got a business lunch.
This is just such a shock.
- I'm vibrating from this.
- We got tickets to the theatre.
What? I'm not going to the theatre.
We've been holding onto these tickets for months.
Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you?
- Tell the police, not me.
- What am I going to say to them?
- Tell them your story.
- I don't have a story.
- I got nothing.
- That's right, you've got nothing.
- Unless I locate her, huh?
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?
- Sit down. We're going to the theatre.
Jack, you were there when Mrs. House died, right? You saw her?
- You saw her?
- She was lying on the floor.
- You're sure it was her, right?
- I'm sure.
- He's sure.
- Right. Right.
My wife's had bad dreams and doesn't know what she's talking about.
This is for the times I call you to fix the faucet and you show up months late.
The super is a drunk.
But we've seen him smelling of Jack Daniel's. Remember?
- Yeah, but...
- Well...
- I know he didn't see Mrs. House.
- If she's a twin, it's a different story.
- You don't feel she is.
- I don't know.
Oh, I know.
Unless he's in on it.
The super's in on it?
The super can't change a fuse.
I mean, she...
- What?
- Well, she's alive. My question is:
- Who was in that bag? I mean...
- She's not alive unless she's a twin.
- Okay? Now, keep quiet.
- Look, somebody...
Somebody got cremated, Larry.
Somebody.
Shut up.
Lillian House. Maiden name Lillian
Beale. Born in Pennsylvania, 1935.
Married Paul House.
She was not a twin.
Had a sister who went to England 20 years ago, a brother who died in 1987.
- This is it.
- This is where we were.
I know. And I was sitting there after you left, having some wine.
- I looked out and saw...
- You saw her after I left?
I saw her on a bus. It was passing...
It was, like...
You're absolutely sure you saw her?
- You saw her face?
- I saw her.
Excuse me.
- I'm telling you.
- What was the bus number?
I don't know the number, but it was heading west to east.
- It obviously was a cross-town bus.
- It's a cross-town bus.
The end of the line is a few blocks down.
- She had to get off somewhere.
- Her destination was the next 6 blocks.
So let's look around.
Maybe we'll see...
...like, you know, a clue or something.
- Maybe we'll see her. You saw her face?
- Don't doubt me. I'm not kidding.
- I think we reached the end of the line.
- This is it.
- Watch out. Watch...
- Yeah, what? Oh.
Look. See? See, he's turning. That's it.
- What do you think?
- What?
Think we should retrace our steps?
- You wear a tie with a dress.
- I don't even know if it looks...
- It'd be too masculine with pants.
- Just don't wear it with pants.
Ted.
- Look.
- At what?
- That hotel.
- What about it?
Waldron. I was in his apartment,
I pressed the last number dialled.
- They answered and said "Waldron."
- Let's get to a phone.
Hello. Mrs. House, please?
Mrs. House.
Can you ring her room for me, please?
- Really?
- Well?
What? Maybe...
Well, maybe she checked out.
- Oh, God.
- Nobody. Nobody at all.
What about...?
Yeah, what about Helen Moss. Moss.
You're sure? Nobody.
Nobody at all. All right.
All right, okay. I'm sorry. Thank you.
Great.
Oh, God. It looks like it's gonna rain again.
Well?
If I get two kings, I take one.
Otherwise, I fold. Got it?
I never go out.
- I just, I can't...
- That's how you wind up on welfare.
But I need the action, for some reason. Okay, just...
- Cut?
- No, go ahead. I trust you. Lay it on me.
- You seem in a strange mood.
- I'm probably a little drunk.
- On Perrier?
- What? I had rum cake.
- Want any cards?
- One second.
Let me see what possibilities
I got here.
Yeah. I'm gonna have...
I'll have...
- I'm gonna have four cards.
- Four.
- Cruisin' for a bruisin'.
- Inside and outside straight.
You're in trouble now.
I can't escape the feeling that my wife is becoming attracted to somebody else...
...and it's really bothering me.
- Really?
Yeah, that's why
I'm not playing my best.
This guy's more adventurous than I am, and they just hit it off.
I'm gonna be very lonely, you know, if this happens.
- You must love her a lot.
- Yeah, I do. I do.
If you want to hold on to her, make some effort. Who's the guy?
- Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.
- Ted?
Well, we could always switch.
Ted gets Carol, I can be your date.
Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with Carol.
- So you bored?
- It's more fun than the Wagner opera.
Yeah. Well, to me, it's one of the most exciting adventures I've ever been on.
Would you rather be here with Ted?
Well, he has a more enthused attitude.
- More enthused?
- Yeah.
- He's a fun guy. I'm a heavy guy.
- You used to be a lot of fun.
If you have a heavy scavenger hunt, he's the man.
I know, but...
- Do you know that this neighbourhood...
- What?
...was where I first took you when we started going out?
You've gotten so stodgy in your old age.
- Remember there was a movie house...?
- Yes! Yeah, I remember.
I took you to see
Last Year at Marienbad.
I had to explain it to you for six months.
Who knew they were flashbacks?
You know...
We've got plenty of time to be conservative. You know?
It's like this tantalizing plum has just dropped into our laps.
Life is such a dull routine and here we are, right?
We're on the threshold of a genuine mystery.
You gonna burst into song?
We're in a car.
Don't make fun of me.
I'm open to new experiences.
Let me ask a personal question.
Did you ever sleep with Ted?
- Don't get nervous.
- Sleep? What, are you nuts?
We were on an eating tour of France.
You spent an evening together.
I know. What about you?
Remember?
You spent the evening with Julie.
That meant nothing.
Julie despised me. You know that.
She thought I was a lowlife, a roach.
Jump in any time you want to defend me.
I'm waiting for you to say something
I don't agree with, okay?
Hey, you're nailing me. Jesus.
Larry.
Larry, Larry, look.
It's her! I'd say it's her!
- Oh, my God, it is.
- See what I mean? I was right.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive. Yes.
- Oh, my God.
- Right? Right? I mean, I was...
- Jesus, I'm... That is her.
- I know. Well, come on.
- I told you so.
- What do you mean? You're nuts.
- Oh, Jesus.
- You're white.
I know. All the blood rushed to my brother.
- Let's find out what's going on.
- I don't want to.
- You're not afraid of her?
- No. I'm a virile male.
Yet, somehow, I am scared.
Maybe because she's dead.
- I'm gonna break this thing wide open.
- Well, how?
- God, if only Ted were here.
- Don't give me Ted.
- Let's get out of here.
- No, I got an idea.
I know. We'll surprise her.
We'll sneak into the hotel.
- How?
- Yeah, no. Come on.
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.
Did you see a woman come in? She was a little woman, about five foot three?
- She had on a grey sweater?
- Older?
- Mrs. Caine? Dark hair?
- Mrs. Caine? Oh, yes. That's her.
- We had a present for her.
- That's right. What room?
- 611. Really. Thanks a lot.
We may need information. I'll take good care of you, if you play ball with us.
- What are you making a face for?
- Will you come on?
- I'm coming.
- What are you doing?
Okay.
- Very nice.
I love a hotel that's got blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard.
Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.
- Mrs. House?
- Mrs. House?
- Mrs. House?
- Hello.
- Hello? Mrs... My God.
- I don't think she's...
- I don't see her.
- This may not be the right place.
Just hold on, Larry.
- Hold on, hold on.
- There's nothing here.
- Larry! Wait!
- What's the matter?
Oh, my God, look! Mrs. House?
Mrs. House?
- What's the matter?
- Hello?
- Larry.
- What?
- I think she's dead.
- Try giving her the present.
- Mrs. House?
- Oh, come on, let's get out of here!
I think she's dead!
I'm thinking of running the marathon.
This woman is forever dying.
Come on, move. Move.
Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears!
- Get down those stairs. Come on.
- Okay, all right.
What happened was
I suspected Mr. House...
- I'm looking around and suddenly a hand is on the floor...
- and she has no twin, but we checked...
- I tried to keep calm.
- There's nobody there.
- What do you mean?
- There's no body there.
- How can there not be anybody there?
- Want to show us where you saw her?
- She was totally dead.
- She's there.
- She was right here.
- She was definitely laying here.
- We're not crazy.
- It looked like she was strangled.
- We're professional people.
- I'm in publishing.
I'm looking to start a restaurant, basically French.
She's a fantastic cook.
I'm against the restaurant.
Calm down. Calm down! Please!
Look, in the time it took you guys to respond, somebody removed the body.
Not that you didn't respond quickly.
It took three minutes.
Not counting the half-hour the 911 operator took to understand me.
Nobody is doubting you.
We're going over the building, all right?
All right.
Did you check...?
- He's been at his business all day.
- Any witnesses?
- Corroborated.
- You didn't use our names, did you?
No, we didn't. If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you tell him?
No. He's in on some scheme here.
We think you should file a report.
Then if anything turns up, it's on record.
- Give us a call, have a good day.
- Thank you. Thanks very much.
- I don't know how...
- I gotta have a drink.
Where is Ted when all this stuff is happening?
He's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight.
He's probably out buying Spanish fly.
- Helen Moss might be in on this.
- I don't want to know about this.
We should change our lives.
We should move out.
Start over, maybe in Mexico. Sell blankets.
We'll work off the hood of a car.
- I'm just beginning to come down.
- I don't know what's happening.
It was like a show where you open the door and see a dead body.
I've never seen a dead person before in my life.
The only one I ever saw was my
Uncle Morris, who was 94.
He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereal.
Is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened to us?
This is too exciting.
I'd like a fishing trip or Father's Day. Or the time we saw Bing Crosby on Fifth Ave.
I don't need a murder to enliven my life at all.
Whoever did it was probably in the room while we were there, hiding.
Make sure and tell me that before I go to sleep tonight.
- That means he probably saw us.
- I'll never get my eyes closed.
I'm petrified. Not only that, but I'm a little drunk.
- I wonder who was cremated. Who was it?
- Well, it was...
- It wasn't Mr. House. He has an alibi.
- Yeah, but I don't buy that.
She doesn't buy the alibi.
Let's get out of here.
I want to go home.
It's starting to rain again.
If only Ted were with us.
He'd have a theory.
Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.
That hotel room was on the end of the hall. It's right up there.
- That's the room.
- I know.
What if they got the body out over that roof?
What are the lights...?
Larry, the lights!
- That's eerie.
- This gave me the chills.
- Let's call the police.
- No, no. Let's check it out.
Check it out?
I'm not gonna check that out.
- There's lights going on there.
- Yeah, that's crazy.
Why don't we go home and call the police...?
No! This is my case.
What do you mean, "your case"?
I don't wanna do this.
If only Ted were with us.
Ted would be shaking in his boots.
I'm only trembling like a leaf.
We're with the police department.
We'd like to check out room 611, please.
- You were here before.
- That's right, yes.
- You are police?
- Just... Show him your card.
- My what?
- Your card.
Your police identification card.
He's got his card.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much. 611.
- Great.
- Is there any trouble?
I'm a detective.
They lowered the height requirement.
I'll take this card back.
They're expensive.
Okay.
- Be careful.
- Telling me to be careful.
- Now, just don't upset anything.
- I'm not.
I'm just gonna leave fingerprints, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped.
The murderer must have hid in this closet.
I don't like this. Let's go.
I gotta be in temple early tomorrow.
He must have dragged the body out really fast.
I'm sorry! The maid.
You don't have to turn the bed out.
And no croissants for breakfast.
Here, take this for yourself.
Keep the mints coming on the pillows.
- Honey, really.
- Let's go. That's why the light was on.
- This is crazy.
- Just a second.
Let me look around here a little bit.
I did damage. I...
- Larry!
- What?
- Larry, look. That's her wedding band.
- How do you know?
- I saw it on her.
- You did?
So much for the police combing this place. Where'd you find it?
Behind the door there.
Let's get out of here. Take the ring.
Maybe there's a pawnshop open.
The police weren't thorough.
They probably thought we were cranks.
We got no body...
They must get 50 crisis calls a minute.
- Why would they bother with us?
- This is very deep stuff.
We should not be here.
This is creepy.
Who knows who's involved in this?
This could go very deep.
This could be like the Warren Commission.
I don't like it.
- Oh, my God!
- What is that?
- The elevator's probably stuck.
- Why are we stopping?
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax!
- I'm a world-renowned claustrophobic.
- It's okay.
- Hit something. I don't like this.
- I am hitting it. It's okay.
It's easy for you to say, but I'm phobic.
There's plenty of air in this elevator.
Just don't panic, okay?
- I'm not panicking.
- Just don't worry.
- I'm gonna say the rosary now.
- Somebody's gonna help us.
- Somebody'll find us here.
- I don't like this.
- Hello?
- Stop it.
- Hello!
- I can't take this.
I'm running over a field,
I see a stallion. I'm a stallion.
Shut up, Larry.
Larry, just shut up and calm down.
- I see grass, I see dirt.
- Shut up! Hello!
You said, "Act like a policeman."
I said no.
You said, "Show them your card."
I said, "What card?"
Larry, boost me up.
We'll get out there.
- We'll do it.
- You can't get through that.
It'll never open. They're painted shut.
- They never open.
- All right, put your hand together.
I'm breathing. I can't breathe.
Larry, I mean...
All I have to do is loosen that, okay?
Put your hand together.
Now give me a boost, okay?
Wait a second! Wait, wait!
You gotta cut down on those rich desserts.
Wait a minute, now!
Wait, wait.
My life is passing in front of my eyes.
The worst part is I'm driving a used car.
- You'd think they'd loosen this thing.
- I'm scared.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. It's her.
- So that's where he hid her.
- Claustrophobia and a dead body.
This is a neurotic's jackpot.
- I'm scared.
- We're going down.
Oh, God, what's happening?
Press up!
I can't see my hand!
How can I press up?
- We must be heading for the basement.
- I want to get off in the mezzanine.
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting back on the elevator.
I can't see anything.
- There's nothing up here.
- Wait!
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing with matches?
These are my matches.
When were you at the Café des Artistes?
- I was with an authoress.
- At the Café des Artistes?
A French authoress.
Wait.
- Jesus.
- This way.
I like a basement with knotty pine and a pool table.
Hey, look. What's this?
Not so fast. I don't like it here.
It's dank and there's strange noises.
I don't know what this is.
Oh, Jesus!
- Calm down.
- Calm down? Don't tell me to calm down.
Found the light.
Let me see. We're locked in here.
What are we gonna do?
Relax, relax.
I'll break it down. Stand back.
Careful, now.
Don't hurt yourself.
Must be one of those new doors.
Over here. Let's try out here.
Oh, God. I keep hearing noises.
- What's down there?
- Where?
Where are you going?
Don't leave me.
What? I think this is the service entrance.
- Come on, get it open. Go into a trot.
- I got it.
- Let's go.
- Where?
- Wait! Do you see that?
- What?
Somebody's putting a body into a car.
It's got a white sheet on it.
Come on.
That is... Let's get out of here.
- No, look! Let's follow him. Come on.
- I'm not going to follow him.
- There was a body in that car.
- I don't want to follow.
Hurry up!
It's probably a rented car.
And a rented body.
Come on.
Oh, Jesus. I can't follow his car.
- He's right up ahead.
- Where?
I don't know which car I'm following.
I'm not a good driver.
I can't chase somebody.
I'm gonna have an accident.
- I'll hit a school bus.
- It's night.
- There's no school buses at night.
- What about night school?
- You have no sense of direction.
- 20l20 vision. Well, not exactly.
- No, I do. He came right here.
- Where are we?
- I don't know. There it is!
- I don't know...
- There's his car.
- How do you know?
- That's his car.
- It is his car. Yes.
- Let's get out.
- Be careful. Be careful.
Look! Look!
Oh, my God! It's Mrs. House's body!
Come on! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped!
Oh, my God.
Goodbye, Mrs. House.
- That was definitely Mr. House!
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm gonna call the police now.
- And tell them what?
This guy's got proof his wife died of a heart attack two weeks ago.
We've got no body. We've got nothing.
What? What? What's wrong?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Hello, there. How are you?
- How are you?
May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday?
This is Larry and Carol, my neighbours.
We were watching Madame Bovary.
- Such a sad story.
- Yeah, it is.
She gets killed at the end.
You gotta stop up for a drink before I go on my trip.
Love to.
If you hear of anybody who needs an apartment, I think I may be moving.
- Come on, Gladys.
- What a shame.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jesus, what a day, huh?
I can't figure it out.
- It's got to be that either he's a...
- What?
Either she's a twin or he's a twin.
Or they're multiple personalities.
Or you're a twin or I'm a twin.
- Because I don't know what's going on.
- You're nuts.
- Look...
- Wait, yeah...
- Let me be logical about this.
- We know she's not a twin.
- What are you talking about?
- I want to puzzle this out.
She's a twin, she's not a twin.
Now you're saying we're twins?!
What are you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm.
I'm calm. Okay.
- Yeah, I'm going to be logical.
- All right.
The first thing is this:
There had been a heart attack. What if they induced it? Some kind of poison.
We never saw the body.
It had to be some other woman.
Some woman who probably had some resemblance to Mrs. House.
The super says he saw her, but he's a drunk.
Mrs. House could have been hiding.
You heard a noise that night.
That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel.
- I can't sleep, I just...
- Wait. It doesn't make any sense.
Suddenly he murders her.
What's it all about?
Why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia, get something to eat and talk with them?
- At 1:00 a.m.?
- So what?
Ted was taking her to a show and dinner.
- You want to schlep out to New Jersey...
- This town never sleeps.
That's why we don't live in Duluth.
Plus, I don't know where Duluth is.
Lucky me.
- You really saw his face?
- No question.
- I'm here to tell you...
- It was Mr. House. No question.
There was no way you could avoid it.
He was right there.
- It's obvious.
- How obvious? What do you mean?
Obvious he's committed the perfect murder.
- What do you mean?
- Okay, look.
You have to start with another woman who resembles Mrs. House.
That's what I said.
It was my idea. I said what she said.
They're with this woman.
Maybe having dinner.
They don't induce a heart attack.
That's fiction bullshit.
She dies spontaneously.
They had no thought of killing her.
- Maybe they wished she was dead.
- Why?
Maybe they stood to gain if she died.
They see an opportunity. Mrs. House dresses her up in her clothes. She hides.
- This is exactly my theory.
- She checks into a hotel.
We got that far, with the exception of the heart attack.
The husband's planning to go to Paris with this young woman.
He's cheating on his wife.
Instead of finishing this scheme...
...he kills her, taking her share of the profits.
- Helen Moss is in on this?
- Good chance she's aware.
What about Mrs. Dalton?
He claims he took her to the movies.
She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his wife.
- She said he was at work.
- He introduced her as a colleague.
- A colleague who maybe loves him.
- He's cheating on her too.
Cheating on two women?
This guy doesn't look the part.
He's gotten away with the perfect murder.
There are no bodies around, and all the paperwork's strictly aboveboard.
- Where did you find her? She's a genius.
- She is. But he knows that we know...
He doesn't care.
Why should he?
Everything's been neatly disposed of. Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth.
- She's right.
- Hold on. We don't know this is true.
- This is just a theory.
- Yeah, but it's a great theory.
- A great theory.
- Everything fits together.
I think it's great.
When I come back from the ladies' room,
I'll tell you how to trap him.
- Unbelievable.
- Where did you find her?
She's really something.
It's like one thing leads to another.
I'm surprised you didn't drool yourselves to death.
- We just had a nice first date.
- I knew they would hit it off.
You were gonna jump into her lap.
What are you talking about?
I'm her editor. I'm a father figure to her.
The only thing you didn't do is rub your hands together.
You're joking.
You're jealous of Marcia?
- It's not that I'm jealous.
- What are we doing here?
Look who's talking. You kept staring at her like she was the Dragon Lady.
You're jealous because he's interested in her?
- I am not jealous.
- What are you...?
Do you take all your authors to the Café des...?
Okay, I've got it.
Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff.
As long as we have no body, we have no case.
What do you mean?
We pretend he slipped up?
The molten steel didn't do the job?
It's possible. He saw you there.
He knows you're onto him.
- Why couldn't you retrieve the body?
- We couldn't have gotten her out.
I would've wound up with a few toes and a shoulder.
What does he know? He was probably too scared to be very lucid.
He's an amateur.
He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow...
...you two dug her out.
- Now you can send him to the chair.
- I like this woman. She's lurid.
- Let me tell you why he won't believe us.
- I can't bluff or lie without giggling.
No, because if we really had the body, why tell him?
Why not go straight to the police?
If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down.
She's wicked. Look how this works out.
You go to the law, what do you gain?
They put him in jail. What have you got?
You haven't got anything.
Right.
But if he wants the evidence, and has to pay for it...
...now he's nervous, right?
- There's just so many fallacies in this.
- What? Name one.
- Name one? Okay.
The guy looks us straight in the eye and says, "What body?
- What are you talking about? Prove it."
- That's when we keep bluffing.
- How? What do we do?
- We produce the body.
But where are we gonna get it?
Madame Tussaud's?
Say we found someone he trusted to corroborate.
- Like who?
- Like his lover.
Say she said, " I've seen Lillian's body.
They want $100,000 for it."
Why would she do that?
Remember that book you recommended,
Murder in Manhattan?
Max Schindler's book.
That's right, the phone call.
You never mentioned that book to me.
- You don't like light reading...
- Since when?
- What is this book?
- It's fantastic! It would be so perfect...
...because she's an actress, a would-be actress...
We could use his theatre.
He's a playwright. This is so perfect.
- Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.
- Thank you. That's great.
- What are we talking about here?
- Listen to this.
We get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything.
And she does them, and we tape-record it.
- Listen.
- I'm listening.
And then we edit the tape recording up and we make one end of a phone call...
...and play it to Mr. House.
- Is it in the book?
- Come on.
- This is perfect.
That could never work.
You don't know what he's gonna say.
- In the book, they use several recorders.
- It's coordinated.
- You base your plan on a dumb paperback?
- This is great. This is great.
He's gotten away with murder. Our only chance is to nab him when he kills again.
It provokes him to kill again.
They catch him the second time.
He's gotten away with the first murder.
You know what I'm thinking?
In the book what happens is...
...he kills the two people working the scheme on him.
But you're not worried about that.
- It's perfect.
- Either that, or I've developed Parkinson's.
- No, we can handle him.
- He knows you're onto him, shake him down.
- He comes after you, we nab him.
- It's great. You're wonderful. I'm amazed.
- It's either that, or he walks.
- So, what you're saying is...
What you're saying is... Oh, boy.
You're saying you wanna provoke Mr. House into trying to murder Larry and me.
Yeah. Perfect. You're not scared, are you?
No, I'm not scared.
I'm turning it over in my mind.
I just want to check with my clergyman before we commit.
Hi, B-24, messages? Oh, really?
Audition for what? Did he say?
Okay. Wait, hold on. Let me get a pencil.
Yeah, well, I've heard just about enough of this.
Great. Thank you, Suzanne.
- We'll let you know. Suzanne Raphael, right?
- Thank you.
Bye.
- This is Helen Moss.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Have you...? I know you just got the material...
...just in the last little while, but have you had a chance to go over it?
- I have, but I have just a few questions.
- Sure, yeah.
Is she divorced in this?
Yes. Yes.
- Recently?
- Yes. Yeah.
But she's... It's highly emotional.
You know, really, a lot of...
A lot of feeling. Very strong. Okay?
- Should I just begin?
- Yeah, whenever you feel into it.
- Hello, Joe? I was just...
- Let me stop you right there. Sorry.
If you'll start out more frightened...
...that will take you where you're gonna go.
- Right, right.
Hello, Joe?
I can't talk much now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
Give me your hand. Hold on.
- Try not to fall. Hold on.
- "I'm trying, I'm trying."
Quickly! Hurry!
They're asking $200,000 for it. Yeah.
They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake.
Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything.
A dark cloud. A pall.
Hello, Joe?
I can't talk much right now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
Hello, Joe?
I can't talk much right now...
Hello, Joe?
Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything.
A dark cloud. A pall.
A pall.
- Pall.
- Pall.
Hello, Joe?
Hello, Paul?
I can't talk much right now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
- Perfect. Great. Great.
- That's great.
- Well, yeah, excuse me.
- It's fantastic.
- There she is.
- Where?
- Keep her busy all afternoon.
- I'll just keep improvising.
It shouldn't be hard.
She's a hungry actress.
I'll get her talking about the part, her life, and her whole background.
- Stop the car.
- We'll hook up later.
- Good luck with your side.
- You too.
Does anybody want some guacamole?
Stop with the guacamole, we have to get started.
- It's 2:30.
- He should be back.
- All right, let's go.
- You got the tape recorder?
All right, one second. Then we can go.
So we're on speaker.
- This is so insane.
- Now, wait. There's...
I'm not nervous.
The contractor came and nobody's here. See if...
- I'll get that. You go and call him.
- Yes, yes, all right.
Hello?
Hello, Paul. I can't talk much now.
If I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
What's the problem?
They have your wife's body.
They showed it to me.
Say that again.
They have your wife's body.
They showed it to me.
- Who has it? How many are there?
- Your neighbours. That's right.
They want $ 200, 000 for it.
Are you calling from a speakerphone?
There's an echo.
- Hold on.
- We don't have an answer for that.
- Go to a different thought.
- What thought? Wait.
You either pay them off, or get rid of them.
- We can't talk on the phone. Can we meet?
- Yes! They're k eeping it refrigerated.
- What? What did you say?
- About two hours ago.
- Two... What? Two hours, what?
- Hold on.
- I got this screwed up.
- Stupid.
- Let's get off quick. We've done it.
- All right. Do something.
Okay.
Hello, Paul. I can't talk much now.
If I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
You're not making sense.
Pull yourself together.
- Now, can we meet? The usual spot.
- Hold on.
Helen? Helen, you still there? Helen?
- Okay, hurry up.
- Forget it.
- Somebody press something.
- Carol. You do it.
You have no choice. Pay them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up.
- What's the matter? You look shaken.
- It's nothing.
- I worry about you these days, Paul.
- I'm fine.
- You're different.
- I said I was fine. Stop interfering.
- You never used to pull away.
- Leave me alone!
I don't want to have this conversation!
My job is to wait one hour and call Mr. House from a phone booth.
- Why are you running?
- I have to change.
- I've got an appointment about...
- What are you steamed up about?
How could you give a book to Marcia and not to me?
What? We just had a big success.
Marcia likes to read what I like.
We've got nothing in common, that's for sure.
Now that Nick's grown, we're left facing each other.
You've got stuff in common with Ted.
You can take your clothes off and baste a chicken.
What about Marcia?
What does she teach you besides poker?
- Nothing, I'm her editor.
- It's time to re-evaluate our lives.
I re-evaluated our lives.
I got a ten, you got a six.
- Maybe I'll go back to my shrink.
- You don't have to see a shrink.
Nothing's wrong with you that can't be cured with Prozac and a mallet.
I would like to be alone a while, okay,
Larry? Just, I... Okay?
I have a crazy father. He's wanted in three states. He has a terrible driving record.
- We had to move to New Jersey.
- Your father is wanted for driving?
Yeah. I moved to Hackensack...
I was in all these different contests.
And I was even Miss Teenage Passaic.
How wonderful.
God.
Was that before or after the fourth abortion?
- After, but before the drama prize.
- Drama prize? I don't remember...
Remember? "Out, out, damned spot"?
The topless Macbeth?
- Yeah, for the fraternity party.
- Yeah.
- Topless Macbeth, how could I forget?
- I was great.
Hello, Mr. House?
This is Larry Lipton.
I got a package
I think you're gonna want.
Of course, it's gonna cost you
$200,000 in small, unmarked bills.
Or large, marked ones, if you want to go that route.
And I have a package. If you want to see your wife alive, do as I say.
Really?
Well, I think you're bluffing.
Don't try and bluff a bluffer. If you've got Carol, put her on the phone.
Larry, help me! I'm here, Larry!
Oh, my God. Don't hurt her!
I'll tell you where to meet me.
Bring that package.
Once I have it and I'm gone, you get her back. Otherwise, I kill her.
Yes. Yeah, no, I understand.
I'll be there. I'll be there.
Yes, I'll bring your wife's body, she... In the trunk of my car.
Yes, I promise, I'll be there.
I don't have his wife's body.
Bluff, bluff.
- Where's Carol?
- Show me Lillian's body.
- I got it.
- No way she survived a molten steel vat.
- No...
- lf you're not bluffing, where is she?
- Why are you nervous?
- Where is she?
- In the trunk of my car.
- Open it. Now.
If she's not there,
I'll put a bullet through your head.
Come on. Come on!
- Step back.
- No, I got her.
If I don't have her, how come I got her ring?
- I think you're lying!
- This is her ring. No.
- What's this?
- I can never bluff.
- I've lost a fortune in cards.
- Listen.
- I'm not a bluffer.
- Get off...
Let go.
That's what Grisby thought.
She meant to kill Grisby.
After he'd served his purpose.
He never even did that.
He went and shot Broome.
And that was not part of the plan.
Broome might have gone to the police.
And if the cops traced it to Grisby...
... and the cops made Grisby talk, he'd spill everything.
And she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby, but quick.
And I was the fall guy.
Why don't you try to understand?
- He was mad. He had to be shot.
- And what about me?
We could've gone off together.
- One who follows his nature, k eeps...
- Help! Help!
They can't see us behind the screen.
And they can't hear us with the sound on.
- Not even a gunshot.
- Hello, Paul. Didn't you expect me?
- Mrs. Dalton.
- You made promises to me over the years.
And then you decided to dump me for that young model.
- I never led you on.
- It's late for excuses.
- None of you can prove anything.
- So you'd be foolish to fire that gun.
With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell, but you are aiming at me, aren't you?
I'm aiming at you, lover. Of course, killing you is killing myself.
- It's the same thing.
- But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us.
- I'm so glad. Are you okay?
- Oh, God, Larry!
I'm so happy to see you!
- I was never so glad to see somebody.
- Get me out.
Are you all right?
You don't know what's going on. I'll never say life doesn't imitate art again.
- We gotta call the police.
- Yes, and a glazier.
- I know. Oh, God.
- Quick. Dial.
Dial. I know. Larry.
Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Honey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Jesus.
- Wife mine.
- Hello?
Oh, God.
God, it's so complicated.
I can't keep track of it all.
Listen.
I'll give it to you one more time.
Mrs. House had a sister who moved to England.
She changed her name when she married.
Her husband died.
She moved back to New York a rich widow, but a recluse.
Mr. And Mrs. House knew they weren't in her will.
They have her to dinner, she accidentally keels over.
She resembles her sister, so they fake it, pretend Lillian House died.
They cremate the sister.
Lillian checks into a fleabag joint...
...pretends to be her sister: Closing her accounts, liquidating her assets...
...accumulating money.
She didn't realize her husband...
...was two-timing her with Helen Moss, this pretty model.
He decides not to cut her in and go off to, I don't know, with his mistress...
...and keep all the dough.
So he kills Lillian.
He cremates her, pours molten steel over her or something...
...and that's when we came along and tripped him up.
- He had great alibis.
- That woman who worked for him?
She covered for him. She loved him.
Not that she dreamed he was a murderer.
I want to celebrate.
What do you want to do?
Want to see what
Larry and Carol are up to?
I think they want to be alone.
Yeah. Okay. All right.
Well, you have any plans?
- You're taking me to dinner, right?
- Right. We can't sleep together.
- Why?
- Not tonight.
I slept with Helen Moss today.
I'm not young like I used to be.
You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you?
- What an experience.
- I know.
- I'm still vibrating.
- I know.
You know, you were surprisingly brave.
Really? Surprisingly?
You seem shocked.
- You know, I'm a pretty good guy.
- I know. 
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Let's not eat anywhere they serve cowards.
- What are you laughing at?
- You know, I love you.
How could you be jealous of Marcia?
Isn't that ridiculous?
- Don't you know I love you?
- You were jealous of Ted.
Ted? You're kidding.
Take away his elevator shoes...
...fake suntan and capped teeth, what do you have?
- You.
- Right. I like that. That's a good one.

On my first day of law school, my professor says two things.
First, "From this day forward, when your mother says she loves you,
- "get a second opinion."
- And?
"If you want justice, go to a whorehouse.
"If you want to get fucked, go to court."
Naomi!
Let's say you have a client who you know is guilty...
No, don't even start with that.
Our justice system doesn't care about that, and neither do I.
Every defendant, no matter who he is, regardless of what he's done, has the right to the best defense his attorney can provide. Period.
- So where were you with the truth?
- Truth?
- How do you mean? Naomi!
- Coming.
I'm not sure how many ways there are to mean it.
You think there's only one?
- I can't do this.
- You're late.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.
Actually, you're right, you know.
- There is only one that matters.
- Marty, hold still, please.
My version of it, the one I create in the minds of those
12 men and women sitting on a jury.
Now, if you want to, you can call it something else.
The... The illusion of truth, if you want.
It's up to you.
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah?
Jack, is that it?
You need some more stuff?
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow afternoon?
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll have my secretary set it up.
Okay.
- This is a cover story, right?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Okay, bye.
Saint Michael's Boys Choir.
Thank you. Thank you.
- What a talented group.
- Tell you after.
- Sure.
- Right now, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna have a brief photo session while we have the boys here with His Excellency.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Please bear with us, enjoy your dessert and thank you.
- Yes.
- Here we go. Okay.
Good, good.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Marty. What an unexpected surprise.
Well, I'm here to help our friendly prosecutor off the hook.
- Excuse me.
- What's it gonna cost?
- A lot less than the alternative.
- Tomorrow at my office, 9:30.
- Is this on? Yes, it is.
- Your Excellency. Nice to see you again.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the heart of the matter, the reason we've all gathered together here tonight.
This is the fifth straight year that it's been my privilege to serve as your master of ceremonies for The Chicago Bar Association and Catholic Charities Ball.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to put that out.
It's a bar, for Christ's sake.
Tonight, due to your generous efforts, we've broken last year's record in terms of attendees and the amount
- of money raised for the Archbishop's...
- I thought you quit.
- ...charity, and I think that deserves...
- I cut down.
...a big round of applause.
- You look beautiful. Cut your hair?
- Yeah. A few months ago.
And now, as it has been my pleasure for the last four years...
- Want to dance?
- There isn't any music.
Sure there is.
...longtime State's Attorney,
God love him, Mr. John Shaughnessy.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen,
- and my personal thanks...
- Come on.
All you have to do is turn around.
I thought you liked it better like this.
That way you don't have to look at the person.
Mean.
Considering the hour, I'll try to keep...
Look at me.
First of all, I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight to support the Archbishop...
Come on, let's go find a bar you can still smoke in.
Thanks for the invite, but I don't like one-night stands all that much.
- We saw each other for months.
- It was a one-night stand, Marty.
It just lasted six months.
Thank you, John.
Well, I must say
I haven't seen this many lawyers and politicians gathered together in one place since confession this morning.
There is no way the People are gonna tolerate a monetary award to a cockroach who deserves 20 to life.
He may be your client, but Joey Pinero is a hard-case felon.
Dealing, racketeering,
- money-laundering, attempted murder.
- Did you say "alleged," Yancy?
I didn't hear you say...
Did you hear him say "alleged"?
Mr. Pinero has never been convicted of anything.
Cops jumped him, left him bleeding in the snow.
It's a miracle he survived.
Having said that,
I'm not opposed to a settlement.
1 .5 million, and Pinero leaves the state.
You can't limit a citizen's right to live wherever he wants to.
Legally, that's unenforceable.
Whether or not it's enforceable or just a gentlemen's agreement,
Mr. Pinero will know what we want.
Get the answer you're looking for.
Don't sit around and chat.
It's been a pleasure.
You're worse than the fucking thugs you represent.
That's enough, Bud. It's over.
- Obviously, I've got to run this by him.
- You're on 40 % commission, Marty.
I have nothing but confidence your recommendation will prevail.
Thank you, John.
My hand!
Oh, shit.
- Hey.
- Mr. Vail.
How you doing?
Nice tune.
So, what'd they say?
Take it or leave it all for 1.5 million.
From Shaughnessy himself.
What do you think?
I think we should take it, unless you want to spend the next two years of your life tied up in appellate court.
- No, fuck that. Close it.
- Done.
Okay.
Your shot.
There's one more little thing.
They want you...
They want you to leave the state.
- They want you to disappear.
- Disappear?
- That's good. Same bullshit, right?
- What? What are you talking about?
I keep getting these offers from these guys, Marty.
What offers?
Well, a couple of months ago, a cop walks in here.
He says,
"You testify against Alderman Martinez,
"and we'll owe you, Joey.
"Say he did you favors, say he's on your payroll," shit like that, right?
So I tell him to go fuck himself.
Why? Because Martinez is a good man.
He's the only one holding out while the others try to turn South River into high-rent condos.
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- Why?
'Cause this shit happens every day.
I didn't think it had anything to do with this.
- You don't?
- Hey.
I've spent a lot of money in this place.
- They've spent a lot more, a lot more.
- I built a clinic here.
- These people depend on me.
- I don't give a shit.
Send them checks from California.
I respect your advice, Marty, but I can't take it.
I'll take the money, but I ain't going anywhere.
- This is my home.
- I don't like it, Joey.
- So what are they gonna do, kill me?
- They tried once.
How are they going to kill a man who never sleeps?
- Get the money.
- You're too much.
- Hey.
- Yeah.
That song you like? Fourth cut.
- Very nice, thank you.
- Yeah.
Christ, we got enough fucking cops here?
No doubt, the police are gonna have their hands full with this one.
Captain Stenner, can you tell us anything right now?
I don't know anything. I just got here.
Captain Stenner, can you tell us what's going on?
Andy, I haven't seen anything yet.
As soon as I go inside,
I'll come out and tell you, okay?
All right.
You should be home in bed, Abel.
It's going around.
I'll consider that, Harvey.
- Christ.
- What a mess, huh?
Sam, you got all you need?
Okay, gently roll him over.
Police! Stop!
Right thumb and forefinger severed.
Symbol "B32.156" is carved into the chest.
- Body temperature, still warm.
- Captain, we got a live one on the run.
You can see now, a passing train has separated the fleeing suspect...
You want to know what I hate?
I'll tell you what I hate.
I hate when they go on and on about what big fucking whores the defense attorneys are.
...the suspect is headed into the train...
We're the bad guys. You know why?
'Cause we're always sitting next to some creep, we start to look creepy, you know?
Plus, they assume they're guilty.
You know, they assume they did it, and, like, we know or something.
You don't know.
You don't ask. You don't care.
You do the goddamn job.
It's not like they're your friends, for Christ's sake.
...there's no telling where the suspect may have gone...
Well, some are your friends, but...
So, why'd you leave the State's Attorney's Office?
Dead-end job.
You either... You either run for office, or you end up a judge.
Why become an umpire when you can play ball?
...continue to pour into the area around Saint Michael's and the Archbishop's mansion.
Over here! He's over here!
We will, of course, stay with this shocking story as it continues to unfold throughout the day.
Now, what we do know right now is that at approximately 11:08 this morning, this...
So, when did you know you had them?
Now, at this hour, the scene at Saint Michael's is crowded...
- What? Sorry.
- Was there a moment during the Pinero trial when you said to yourself,
"I've got them"?
The day I took the case. Excuse me.
...the shocking murder this morning of one of Chicago's most beloved figures,
Archbishop Richard Rushman, has left the city just numb.
Okay, I understand we have Andy live.
Let's go to Andy.
Diann, we have just learned that Chicago police have arrested a 19-year-old man tentatively identified as Aaron Stampler.
Now, according to Captain Abel Stenner...
We're gonna have to reschedule.
Call my office, okay? I'm sorry.
...underneath McCormick Place just minutes after the murder...
...through cold-blooded savagery, a beacon of hope has been taken from us.
Law offices of Martin Vail.
- You got the news on, by any chance?
- Yeah, we're watching it.
All right, I want you to call Sullivan in Judge Trotter's office.
Find out where they took him, and call me right back.
I'm at The Alibi.
- A lot of guys are gonna want this one.
- Okay.
The police have taken the first steps, acting with speed and determination with the arrest.
Are you taking the Stampler case?
Andy, I'm sorry.
I can't talk to you about anything.
Thank you very much.
When are you gonna talk?
- State's Attorney left yet?
- Yeah. Yancy, no less.
- Yeah? P.D.?
- Come and gone. Lockup!
- Give my best to your brother.
- Yeah, sure.
I'd like to see him alone, if I could.
All right, but I'm gonna have to lock you in.
Understood.
You know who I am?
Well, no. No, sir. No, I don't.
My name is Martin Vail.
I'm what you call a big-shot attorney.
I don't... I don't have no money.
No, I didn't think you did.
I'm willing to take your case pro bono, which means you get all of my expertise and hard work for free.
Or, if you want to, you could get the $40,000-a-year, court-appointed public defender, who will almost certainly escort you personally to death row.
Your choice.
No. No, sir. I...
I'd surely be grateful for anything you could do for me.
You're welcome.
Now, your full name is?
My... Aaron Luke Stampler.
Stampler.
- You from Kentucky, Aaron?
- Yes, sir. I'm from Creekside.
Does it say that there?
How long you been here in Chicago?
Well, two years next month, I think.
- Have you ever been arrested?
- No. No, sir.
So how do you know the Archbishop?
I was begging on the street up on Wacker Drive,
Bishop Rushman came by in his Cadillac.
He saw me, and he stopped.
He took me into Savior House.
I work as an altar boy.
I sing in his choir.
How long were you there at Savior House?
Year, year and a half.
You're supposed to leave when you're 18, but Bishop Rushman let me stay on way past my 19th birthday.
That was nice of him.
Yes. Yes, it was.
Aaron, did you have any reason to dislike the Archbishop?
Dislike? No. No, sir.
He was like a father to me.
Yeah, but you...
How do I say this? Were...
Were you in the room when he was murdered?
How can you explain that?
There was someone else in that room, Mr. Vail.
- There was a third person?
- Yes, sir.
Did you tell the police this?
Yes. Yes, I did, but they didn't believe me.
All right. Well, you tell me now.
I was returning a book to Bishop Rushman's library.
I heard noise, so I went back into his...
In his bedroom.
Bishop Rushman was laying on the floor.
There was blood all over everything.
And then I seen a shadow. I seen a person leaning over Bishop Rushman.
He looked up and then he came at me, and that's when I lost time.
What does that mean, "lost time"?
I blacked out.
It just... It happens to me sometimes.
I just... I have spells.
I have spells. I lose time. I can't...
I can't remember nothing.
Why did you run from the police, Aaron, if you didn't do anything wrong?
Well, when...
When I woke up, I was covered in blood.
I didn't know what to do.
I got scared. I heard sirens, so I ran.
Look, I know how it looks, Mr. Vail, but I swear...
Yeah, I don't need you to try to convince me, Aaron.
I just want you to answer my questions.
But I didn't do this.
You've got to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you.
I don't care.
I'm your attorney, which means I am your mother, your father, best friend and your priest.
In other words, I don't want you talking to anyone but me from now on.
Not the cops, not the press, not the other guys in the cells here, nobody without my permission, you understand? Yeah?
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- All right.
Now the important stuff.
What's your suit size?
- My what?
- Suit size. What, you're about a 38?
I don't know.
- About a 38 long.
- Okay.
Stampler was flushed by the police from his hiding place in the bushes behind the cathedral.
The police chased him through the train yard, just north of McCormick Place, almost losing him as he scrambled over tracks before an oncoming train, separating him from the police.
In a later development, prominent local criminal defense attorney Martin Vail is believed to have visited Stampler at the Maxwell Street Precinct...
After a brief chase across the rail yard behind Saint Michael's Cathedral,
Stampler was apprehended in a hole beneath train tracks.
- Are you gonna defend this man?
- Andy, I'm sorry. I can't...
Thank you very much. Thank you.
We've taken the first step in the process.
I can now take your questions.
Can you tell us anything about the altar-boy group
- that Aaron Stampler was part of?
- Not much at this time.
Have you ruled out the involvement of any of the other altar boys?
We have no reason to suspect anyone other than Stampler.
He had access to the Archbishop's quarters.
He was caught fleeing the area of Saint Michael's.
The blood-soaked Aaron Stampler was chased down under McCormick Place, but not before he was almost killed by a passing train.
Law office of Martin Vail.
He's gonna call you as soon as he gets in.
I know. I promise you.
Okay, thank you very much.
- Naomi!
- Yeah.
- Talk to you later. Bye.
- Hey.
Sorry I'm late. We have a new client.
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.
- Who?
You know what they're calling him already?
- The Butcher Boy of Saint Mike's.
- I like that.
Well, that's good.
You're gonna be hearing it a lot.
This kid who chopped up the Archbishop, he's our new client?
Tommy, you're gonna have to try harder to get the word "allegedly" into your vocabulary,
- especially if you want to be a lawyer.
- Here you go.
- Tommy, you want coffee?
- No. No, thanks.
All right. He admits he was in the room when the killing occurred, but he didn't actually see it happen.
- Can I stop you right there?
- No.
He was returning a book to the Archbishop.
He heard loud noises in the bedroom.
He went in. He sees a figure, someone in the shadows kneeling over the body. He blacks out.
Next thing he knows, sirens are screaming, he's covered in blood.
The cops find him in a train tunnel.
He's got the Archbishop's ring in his pocket.
He stole the Archbishop's ring?
I didn't say that.
I said it was in his pocket.
Is that it?
Yep.
That's... That's bullshit, Marty.
That's the worst bullshit story
I've ever heard in my entire life.
Now it's our bullshit story.
Okay, let's get to work.
Now, the name of the game here is motive, as in, the prosecution doesn't have one.
So what we have to do here is prove that someone else could have committed the crime.
Then we can establish reasonable doubt.
So I want to know everything I can about this guy, everything he was into.
We go to database, go to Hall of Records, IRS files.
- Even his so-called charities.
- So-called?
The guy was a priest, for Christ's sake.
Naomi, write this down. B-32.156.
That was carved into the Archbishop's chest.
- Allegedly.
- No.
That was a fact, but I appreciate the effort, Tommy.
Thanks.
I also need case histories on murder by stabbing, murder by mutilation, murder by religion.
- Also, I'm gonna need a psychiatrist.
- You're telling me.
And not the kind that lives in a witness box, either.
I need a real one this time, and someone who knows about amnesia.
- What does he look like in person?
- The Butcher Boy?
Like a Boy Scout.
A Boy Scout with a merit badge in carving.
The Archbishop was a close personal friend of Mr. Shaughnessy.
He came to me earlier this morning and asked me who was my best man,
- I said you.
- Thank you.
I trust, Mr. Shaughnessy, if I am to prosecute this case,
I'll be given the authority which comes with the assignment.
You're the one trying the case, but let's establish one thing at the outset.
I want the death penalty.
I'd like an opportunity to go over the case before we make a determination on whether or not to seek the death penalty.
I'm open to anything you have to say, Janet, but in my mind there's no debate.
Did he say anything, the boy they picked up?
Yeah. He didn't do it.
It's a slam dunk, Janet.
Excuse me.
I appreciate your faith in me, and I don't mean to be argumentative...
Hey, that's what we pay you for.
...but if it's as open and shut as you say it is, then you don't need me.
The P.D. will plead no contest, throw the kid on the mercy of the court.
- There's not a public defender.
- He's got a lawyer already? Who?
Hey, I'm Martin Vail.
I'm defending Aaron Stampler.
- I need to inspect the murder site.
- The Butcher Boy?
Thank you. Yes. I forgot his real name.
What's the matter, Marty, lost your faith?
Looking for a little religion?
Now tell me, Counselor, which one of us is the true headline-chaser here?
- Unlike you, I was assigned to this case.
- Yeah? Think you're up to it?
Sell the book rights yet, or are you gonna wait a while?
Want to see some pictures?
Come on. They're kind of cute.
I think you'll agree they clearly show the heinous nature of the crime.
A small piece of advice, don't use the word "heinous" in a courtroom.
Half the jury won't know what you're talking about.
One small piece of advice,
I'm not sitting second chair to you anymore.
In case you hadn't noticed, I graduated.
- I had no reason to leave.
- You had every reason to leave.
How can you still work for them?
What? You really expect me to trot out after you, Marty?
Quit, just because you did?
I don't need a Mercedes.
I don't need to see my face on the evening news.
You knew I was coming here, didn't you?
You knew I would defend him.
That's why you took the case.
You asked Shaughnessy for this, didn't you?
Oh, please.
What's the matter, Marty, you nervous?
Been a while since you rubbed up against a woman with a brain?
What is the matter? You tired?
You haven't been sleeping well?
You're the one with the score to settle, Marty.
I sleep great at night.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Thanks.
- Hey. Where is he?
- Over here.
All right, we'll be sitting at a table together, along with two of my associates.
Now, once the charges are read, the judge is gonna ask you how you plead.
- Not guilty.
- No.
- But I'm not guilty, Mr. Vail.
- I don't care. It doesn't matter.
You can keep your mouth shut.
You don't say anything.
Well, you're going to say I'm not guilty.
I'll say whatever I say.
You don't have to worry about it.
- But, Mr. Vail...
- This is exactly what I'm talking about.
This can't go on in the courtroom, so you might as well get used to it now.
I speak. You do not speak.
Your job is just to sit there and look innocent.
Well, I am innocent.
That's it!
That's exactly how I want you to look.
That's exactly it.
Now, can you remember that?
Look in the mirror if you have to.
That's the look.
I don't have to.
This is how I always look.
Well, then you're way ahead of the game already, aren't you?
Don't smile.
Don't.
Mr. Vail, can we have a statement?
No. We're gonna find out what happened here.
How can you defend Aaron Stampler in the face of all this public pressure?
The only pressure is to find the truth.
...with the Archbishop's blood on him.
You've been talking to the police again, haven't you? I told you not to.
As usual, they get everything wrong.
Come on. How're you gonna explain the fact that he had blood-soaked clothing on him?
- We all saw that.
- At this juncture,
I'm not going to explain it at all.
I've only recently been retained in this case.
Significant facts are in dispute here and continue to be in dispute.
Marty, you're a master at putting the victim on trial to help your own client.
That's going to be very difficult in this case.
A victim in this case is my client.
We have two victims here, no suspects.
Thank you very much.
Are you worried about his safety, Marty?
No. Thank you.
It's not a case.
I don't think there'll be any question about the verdict.
All rise.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
- Bailiff?
- State v. Aaron Stampler.
Is everyone here? Sit down.
Is everyone here?
Yes, Your Honor.
Madam Prosecutor?
The State charges the prisoner,
Aaron Stampler, with the crime of murder in the first degree.
How does your client plead, Counselor?
Your Honor, if it pleases the court,
I need time to make a complete psychiatric evaluation before any charges are brought against us.
State has more than enough evidence to warrant the allegations, Your Honor.
I agree. Motion denied.
Mr. Stampler, do you understand the charges brought against you?
- Yes. Yes, I...
- Your Honor, I direct my client not to answer that question on the grounds that his response may tend to incriminate him.
The defendant is taking the Fifth on whether or not he understands the charges?
Yes, Your Honor. Until we have a complete psychological evaluation, he will be taking the Fifth on any and all questions posed to him.
State v. Appleby for your review of precedent.
Thank you.
No, no, I can't do that. No.
What do you want?
I'm looking for the room a kid named Aaron Stampler stayed in.
- You the police?
- I'm his uncle.
- Thanks.
- Well, hey.
- This is Alex's.
- Who's Alex?
- He's one of the other altar boys.
- An altar boy?
An altar boy was wearing this?
Well, not at the mass.
Well, this altar boy attacked a colleague of mine.
He hurt him pretty bad.
What do you think he was doing there in your room?
- My room?
- Yeah.
I can't... I don't know.
- I mean, I don't have nothing.
- You know where I could find him?
Who? Alex?
- No, I don't... I don't know where he is.
- You don't?
- Who's Linda?
- Linda?
She your girlfriend?
- Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.
- I don't know where she is.
Why is it that I get this feeling you're not telling me something, Aaron?
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I don't think so.
Are you surprised that Alex attacked my friend?
- No. No, I mean, he has a temper.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so.
Let me ask you this.
Do you think it could be Alex who was that figure you saw at the Archbishop's room?
- I... Alex? I couldn't be sure.
- But it could be him?
I don't know.
Aaron, you're not understanding this.
The State wants you dead.
If you don't help me, that's exactly what they're gonna get.
I...
I'm trying. I can't remember.
I don't understand. Why would Alex want to do such a thing?
For his own reasons. He...
Maybe someone hired him.
- Hired by who?
- I don't know. Forget it.
What I need to know is, do you think he's capable of doing it?
I don't know. He...
I don't know who's capable of such a thing, Mr. Vail.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
So he claims there was someone else in the room and that he can't remember.
And you want me to look into this amnesia question
- and see what he actually knows.
- Yeah.
What if he knows he did it?
The major causes of amnesia are substance abuse, seizures, head injuries and malingering.
I think the kid's telling the truth.
Okay.
Then let's get something straight.
I'm more than happy to go in and analyze him.
In fact, I'm looking forward to it.
But I won't go in there to validate his story, understood?
- You do your job, I do mine.
- That's right.
Listen, if I think it's necessary,
I'd want to get an MRI, EEG, and neuropsych testing, agreed?
- Yes, Doctor. Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.
I'll be recording our meetings for Mr. Vail, so what we talk about isn't as confidential the way it might be if you were to be consulting with a doctor for help.
He may even call me as a witness, so if you have any questions about what I've just said, you should raise them now, while he's still here.
- No, ma'am. I understand.
- Good.
- So, okay. I think we'll be fine.
- All right.
- I'll see you later. All right.
- Okay.
Bye.
Mr. Vail told me that there was a period of time surrounding the Archbishop's death that you don't remember.
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yes. I lost the time.
I mean, I blacked out.
- Have you had these blackouts before?
- Yes. Yes, I have.
When's the first time you remember them happening?
They started when I was about 12, maybe.
Were your parents aware of what was happening to you?
No. My mother was dead.
And your father?
No. No. No. He was not a nice man.
- Did you seek treatment?
- Did I what?
Did you see a doctor for them?
No. No.
You don't go see a doctor in Creekside unless your leg's broke.
- Hey. Can I talk to you?
- Talk.
- Excuse us. I'll bring her right back.
- How dare you. What am I?
I'm some kind of chess piece you can just move around?
- I was in the middle of my lunch.
- When are we getting all the discovery?
What do you want, Marty?
I want to know when we're getting all the discovery.
- I've got motions to file.
- No, you don't.
You're looking to make a deal.
I have no authority to deal.
I haven't discussed this with my client.
What's your excuse?
Well, if I thought we needed to make a deal,
I have all the authority I want.
Bullshit! Shaughnessy wants the whole shot on this, and he's using you to get it.
Anybody in your position would deal this down to murder with no death penalty.
My position?
We have a fucking great case.
Great case?
Lack of prior record, no eyewitness, no confession, no motive.
Hard evidence.
I assume this conversation means you're not going with insanity, which is a shame.
My shrinks would have torn him apart.
By the way, your pleading the Fifth on the charges was brilliant.
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
I liked it.
You lose this case, you take the fall, not Shaughnessy.
- Talk to me.
- We're going to trial, Marty.
All right, all it takes is one, just one juror that doesn't believe he did it.
One juror, with a kid his age, looks into that face...
I've got to admit, that face is great.
Are you prepping him to take the stand?
That stutter, it's priceless.
Marty, don't tell me you think he didn't do it.
What, has little Aaron Stampler gotten to you?
We're not just talking about jail here.
It's about ending someone's life.
If you're wrong and Shaughnessy's made you do this,
- you gonna be able to live with it?
- I'll live.
See you in court.
Your Honor, we stipulate that murder was done here.
Therefore, these photographs have no remaining probative value.
This is not just murder.
This is a case of mutilation and torture.
The only reason the prosecution wants to show these gory pictures to the jury
- is shock appeal.
- That is not true, Your Honor.
- They should be excluded, absolutely.
- They clearly identify the heinous nature of the crime, and they connect the defendant, who was found covered in blood, to the crime scene.
- Prejudicial.
- I beg to differ.
- Beg all you want. I don't...
- Counsel, please.
The photographs are in, Mr. Vail.
Now, would you two like a recess so you can carry on this discussion in private?
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but this is too much.
Next thing you know, he'll be objecting if we want to bring in the murder weapon.
Well, now that she brings it up...
This is a public building.
Excuse me, Mr. Vail.
Would you sign this for me?
Tell me about Linda.
Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.
Yes. Yes, she was.
How'd you meet?
Well, we was both at the Savior House.
I was an altar boy, and she was doing work for Bishop Rushman.
- What was the relationship like?
- Me and Linda?
She's real cultural.
Real cultural and very smart.
We had a nice time together.
We might get married.
Were you sleeping together?
- Well, that's private.
- I know. I have to ask the question.
Were you having a sexual relationship, Aaron?
Yeah, yes, yes, we were.
Were you sleeping with anyone else at the time?
- No.
- Was she?
Has she been to see you, Aaron?
- Well, well, no, but...
- And that upsets you.
No. No. Thing is, she went away.
She went away for a while.
She left before this happened.
I don't even think...
Don't even think she knows about it.
- Yo, boss.
- Hey.
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.
There's nothing cataloged at the downtown branch under the numbers B32156.
But I don't think the "B" is a "B."
I think it's an eight.
I think the knife slipped. 832156.
"Thomas Jefferson"?
I don't think he did it.
All right. Well, you're not gonna be much happier with this.

Nothing startling here, except for how many there are.
Wait a minute here. What's this?
What was he doing with the South River deal? Pull that up.
Who are the investors?
Shaughnessy?
That's Joey Pinero's neighborhood.
See this lot here?
This all used to be houses.
In fact, there was a house over there on the corner where I kissed my first girlfriend.
Got her pregnant, too.
- Hell of a kiss, Joey.
- Oh, yeah.
Anyway, this whole neighborhood's gonna end up high-rent condos if those guys get their way.
That's why I'm gonna buy back the lot with the settlement you got me.
- You heard about that, right?
- Yeah.
- The money?
- Who hasn't?
- Marty's the best, man.
- Just doing my job.
Yeah. A million fucking five, he's just doing his job.
Alderman, Joey tells me a cop came around, wanted him to set you up.
It's typical.
Can't buy me, so they try and buy a brother.
See, most people assume that this land we're walking on belongs to the railroad, but it doesn't.
It belongs to the church.
The church?
- So that's the Rushman Foundation?
- That's right.
Along with a bunch of rich developers.
- Including John Shaughnessy?
- Yeah.
Then they got greedy, started buying up all the land and old buildings around the church property, then tearing it down.
Our old neighborhood was gonna disappear.
So I went to the Archbishop and I said,
"What are you doing to these people?
They're poor.
"They're getting kicked out of their homes,
"and they're Catholic."
Fucking A.
He listened. I couldn't believe it.
He told them to stop developing around the church property.
So the partners are left holding these empty buildings they can't knock down
- and land they can't build on.
- That's right.
Shaughnessy loses millions.
Look, if I need you to, will you testify?
Who, me? Yeah. Easy.
Just change out of this suit, put on a Brooks Brothers
- with loafers and tassels, you bet.
- Joey, thank you.
Thank you. Not you.
Sure.
I'll testify.
Well, you know what people think.
Think this great city runs itself.
They think it gets up, goes to work and climbs into bed at night just like we do.
They're unaware of what it takes to make sure the whole damn thing doesn't break down.
Crime, fires, riots, the goddamn water pipes bursting under the city.
Christ, what a fucking mess that was.
And who does the water commissioner call?
The contractor who built it? No.
He calls me. They all call me.
God damn, this is terrific.
They call me, because I keep the peace.
That's my job.
This city doesn't burn because I won't permit it.
I'm the great negotiator.
You think people get that?
Truth is, they don't care.
Dumb bastards don't even vote.
All they want to do is eat, sleep, watch TV and occasionally fuck their wives.
Guess we should all thank you.
You're welcome.
John, you need some new material.
I've heard this "great city" speech
10 times already.
Your boy Pinero's not honoring his side of the deal.
Is that what this dinner was about?
Pinero?
In part.
I told him what the deal is.
He's a grownup. What's the other part?
I understand your assistant's been digging around in the Archbishop's financial affairs.
Yeah. Well...
How much did you lose when he pulled the plug from South River, John?
Let me tell you something.
It's a mistake to stick your thumb in the eyes of the most powerful people in the city.
It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.
Do not fuck with me, Marty.
Pipes are bursting again, John.
In the most anticipated murder trial in recent Chicago history, former State's Attorney prosecutor
Martin Vail will lead with his opening statement on behalf of Aaron Stampler...
The prosecution's case is headed by Assistant State's Attorney
Janet Venable. Venable was...
Richard Rushman was a man of God.
He spent his life giving to the people of Chicago.
He was a beacon of inspiration, not only as a spiritual leader, but as a citizen.
...will deliver his opening statement tomorrow on behalf of defendant...
My name is Martin Vail, and the reason I'm here, and the reason you're here, is to make sure that the whole truth is known.
Now, we can begin to learn the truth by talking about what the prosecution does not want you to hear.
Do not be fooled by the defendant's innocent appearance and demeanor.
Aaron Stampler sat in judgment of Archbishop Rushman and determined that not only should he die, but he should die the most brutal way possible.
Aaron was arrested within minutes of the Archbishop's death.
We all know that.
We all saw it on television.
But why? Because he was convenient.
Because there was enormous pressure on the police to solve this crime.
The evidence will show that Aaron Stampler stalked, ambushed and savagely murdered this great man.
The prosecution does not want you to hear about the other altar boys in the church choir who have mysteriously disappeared.
At the close of evidence, ladies and gentlemen, you will learn that Aaron Stampler had everything he needed for the perfect assassination.
Using this knife,
Aaron Stampler repeatedly stabbed at the Archbishop's chest, his genitals, his eyes.
They don't want you to hear that the Archbishop made investments on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church and that those investments resulted in huge losses for some very, very powerful people.
They don't want you to hear about the 20 death threats this year alone that the Archbishop received prior to his death.
And they really don't want you to hear about their theory of motive.
And why is that? Very simple.
They don't have one.
Inspector Woodside, can you explain to the court where these sneakers came from?
They were taken off the defendant when he was apprehended.
And what was the result of the bloodstain analysis done on them?
The result of the analysis proved to be human blood matching the blood type and DNA characteristics of Archbishop Rushman.
What do the bloody footprints surrounding the body tell you?
The killer left a pattern of bloody footprints around the area of the struggle, as indicated by the spread of blood through the room.
All right, yes or no, Inspector?
Could there have been a third person in the Archbishop's quarters that morning?
There is no evidence to suggest that.
But there's no evidence to prove there wasn't.
No.
And after the struggle, what happened then?
Well, analysis suggests that the killer was startled during the mutilation and ran from the bedroom down the stairs.
Is it possible, Inspector, that the real killer, a third person, who maybe was smart enough not to tramp a whole freeway of blood through the whole place here, couldn't this third person have placed the defendant's prints on the knife while he was passed out?
Mr. Vail, anything is possible.
So, clearly, the victim suffered a great number of stab wounds?
Yes, he did, 78.
He tried to defend himself.
And that explains the cuts on the hands and the forearms.
Doctor, isn't it a fact that you can't be sure whether more than one person inflicted these 78 stab and incise wounds?
That's true, Counselor. It could've been more than one person, but I doubt it.
From your analysis of the knife wounds, Dr. Weil, do you have an opinion whether the killer was left-handed or right-handed?
Well, the incise wound to the throat and most of the chest wounds were made from an angle that strongly suggests that a left-handed person was using the knife.
To your knowledge, is the defendant left-handed?
Yes, he is.
Well, then it's possible that a right-handed person could've deliberately used his left hand to inflict some of these wounds.
Yes, I suppose that is possible.
Then it would be reasonable to assume that there was, in fact, a third person there at the crime scene?
Reasonable, no. But it is possible.
Then following opening statements, it was a day of strong and detailed testimony from the prosecution's first witnesses,
Cook County Forensics Chief
Harvey Woodside and Cook County Medical Examiner
Emile Weil.
It was also a day of tough cross-examination of Woodside and Weil by Stampler defense attorney
Martin Vail.
By most accounts, though, the prosecution...
Captain Stenner,
I would like to thank you for all the time you've given us today, but, finally,
I would like to turn your attention to the symbol carved into the Archbishop's chest.
Now would you please tell the jury about that, Captain?
Yes. The letter and the numbers B32.156 were carved into the Archbishop's chest.
What you just described, have you been able to find an identical reference anywhere?
I believe so, yes.
The symbol B32.156 is actually catalog code for a book discovered in a private reading room located in the church basement.
That particular number, the B32 part, refers to a book,
The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
When we opened the book to Page 156, we discovered an underlined passage.
Would you please read this underlined passage to the court?
"No man, for any considerable period,
"can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude
"without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true."
Thank you.
What does that passage mean to you, Captain?
Objection. He's a policeman, not an English professor.
His interpretation would be speculative and irrelevant.
I didn't hear her ask for an expert opinion.
The witness can answer.
Well, to me, it's simple.
The killer thought that his victim was two-faced, dishonest in some way.
In your experience, Captain, do killers ever intentionally leave clues to their motive?
Not often, but it happens.
Thanks.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.
Did you underline that book?
- Did I what?
- Did you underline that book?
- No. No, Mr. Vail.
- No?
No. Mr. Vail.
I never even opened The Scarlet Letter.
I don't like Hawthorne.
I tried to read that one about the house with the seven somethings in high school.
I couldn't even get past Page 10.
I mean, I weren't the only one using
Bishop Rushman's library.
You know what? Everybody borrowed books from Bishop Rushman.
He encouraged it.
His altar boys and staff, everyone was in there.
Guard?
Thanks.
You don't give up, do you?
So you didn't know anything about that?
- No.
- What about the impact of...
Look, I can't talk to you right now.
My office will call you, all right?
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay, bye. Yeah, I'll see you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What the fuck happened in there?
I guess that eight was a "B" after all.
You think this is funny?
We're losing this case.
What the hell happened, Tommy?
How could you have missed that?
Marty, there are 50 of them, plus the entire
Chicago Police Department.
How was I to know he had a private reading room in the church basement?
- It's your job to know.
- Fuck, Marty, you want my job?
No. I want you to do your fucking job!
Marty, come on.
I'm working on a third-man defense here.
Do you know that?
Have you figured that out yet?
I don't have a third man.
You know why I don't have a third man?
'Cause you can't fucking find him!
That's why.
Is it that hard to find one indigent kid?
Look, maybe we already got the kid who did this.
We have to at least consider the possibility that he did it.
All the hard evidence is pointing towards him, and you keep refusing to even look at it.
I'm not refusing to look at anything!
I don't think he did it!
Look, you two, we're up there in a couple of days, and we got dick!
So I wish the two of you'd do your fucking goddamn jobs, all right?
Fuck!
It must have been hard for you to come here to Chicago.
You didn't know anybody.
No. Nobody.
Didn't have any money?
No, nothing.
I want to talk more about your girlfriend,
Linda, now. Can we, Aaron?
- No.
- Why not?
Aaron.
I'm sorry.
Do you think we can do this later?
- No, I want to stay with this for a minute.
- I'm just feeling a little tired.
I know. Why does talking about Linda Forbes upset you?
It doesn't.
I just don't want to talk about it right now.
- Why not? Are you all right?
- No, my head hurts.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Let me just fix this.
Hey, you know what I can do with this thing?
No, how the fuck should I know?
Jesus Christ.
Aaron?
What?
What were you saying?
Come on.
Stop him!
Who the fuck are you?
What do you want?
What do you want, God damn it?
I'll kill you!
I don't think so, Alex. Drop it.
Drop it.
- Remember me?
- My name is Martin Vail.
I don't give a fuck what your name is.
- You got no right doing this to me.
- I have every fucking right!
I'm Aaron Stampler's attorney, you little shit!
Now, what do you know about the Archbishop's murder?
Nothing.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Bullshit! Don't fuck with us.
I swear I know nothing.
Well, then, what were you doing over there?
What were you doing at Aaron's house?
What were you looking for?
- A tape.
- A tape? Videotape?
- Yeah.
- Of what?
Sex stuff.
Sex stuff?
What, I have to draw a picture for you?
Who?
Who?
Me, Linda.
And Aaron?
Yeah. He shot it, too, for the Archbishop.
Are you telling...
Are you telling me that Archbishop
Rushman is involved with sex stuff?
Yeah, he called it "purging the devil."
He'd say a sermon for 10 minutes, and then he'd tell us what to do.
- You're full of shit.
- I don't give a fuck what you believe!
Hey, hey, hey. What? What?
What were you going to do with the tape?
- What were you going to do?
- Trash it.
I was gonna throw it away.
Just one. One tape. Just one tape.
Yeah. Yeah. One. He'd use the same one. He'd keep recording over and over.
So what made you think Aaron had this?
I don't know. I thought maybe he got it, and he went back and killed him.
- I mean, he did kill him, right?
- No, he didn't.
So where's this girl? Where's Linda?
I don't know.
She freaked out!
She panicked. She split.
I don't know.
I'm not expecting any postcards.
Look at me. Look at me.
Get him the fuck out of here, Tommy.
- Where to?
- A warm bunk and three meals a day.
- You can't arrest me! You're not a cop!
- I used to be. Does that work for you?
- Look who's here.
- Don't get up. Finish it.
- It's a good article.
- You know the rules.
Don't disturb anything.
Don't remove anything.
If you do, it's my ass.
Yeah, mine, too. I won't touch anything.
Excuse me.
...preach the gospel to every...
Hello.
- What are you guys watching?
- Wait a minute.
Go to her. Good.
Now help her. That's it, Aaron. Good.
Linda, help out.
Good. Take off her blouse, Aaron.
That's it. Now help him, Linda.
Isn't that sweet, Linda? Good. That's it.
Now, take him in your mouth.
- Here's motive.
- Aaron, take her from behind.
- Aaron, take her from behind.
- Jesus Christ.
Thanks.
487113 report to...
- I need to talk to him alone.
- I think there's something
- we should discuss.
- I need to be alone with my client.
Do you trust me?
Do...
Yes, yes, of course I do.
Good. Because I don't trust you.
I'll lay it all out for you.
I'm losing this case.
You know why I'm losing this case?
'Cause my fucking client is fucking lying to me.
- I never lied to you.
- Bullshit!
That's it. No more bullshit.
No more games.
Everybody thinks you did this, everybody.
I'm the only one who believes you, and I am that close.
So I want it all out. All of it.
Right now, right here.
Did you underline that book?
Hey, hey. Hey, look at me.
Did you underline that book?
- No, I didn't.
- I don't believe you.
- That is bullshit.
- I told...
I don't fucking believe you!
I saw the tape!
I saw the tape. I know what he did to you. I want to hear it from you.
No! No! No!
Tell me the whole thing.
Don't fucking do this.
I want you to tell me the truth, and do not even think of lying.
You fucking killed him, didn't you?
You did it!
- You killed him. You're so full of shit!
- No!
You did it, didn't you?
Tell me the truth. Don't lie to me.
You little fuck! You did it.
You killed him! You son of a bitch!
- You fucking killed him!
- No!
What the hell do you want from me now?
Quit your crying! I can't understand a goddamn word you're saying.
You little sissy! You make me sick!
- Looky here. Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?
This is my cell, Jack!
Who the fuck are you?
I got you now. You're the lawyer.
- You his lawyer, ain't you?
- Yeah.
Yeah, with your fancy suit.
I heard about you.
Well, my, my, you sure fucked this one up, Counselor.
It sounds to me like they're gonna shoot old Aaron so full of poison it's gonna come out his eyes!
- Where is Aaron?
- Aaron's crying off in some corner somewhere.
You scared him off!
You've got to deal with me now, boy.
I ought to give you a beating on principle. Look at me.
You ever come in here and pull any of that tough-guy shit on Aaron again,
I will kick your fucking ass to Sunday!
- Do you understand me?
- I understand you. I understand.
Aaron gets in trouble, he calls you.
You're the man.
Well, Aaron couldn't kick his own ass.
I mean, you seen him, with the...
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, he can't handle anything.
He sure as shit couldn't handle all that preacher's blood, could he?
If he'd done like I told him, we wouldn't be in this mess, but he got scared, and...
Ran off, got hisself caught, the stupid little shit.
So Aaron did kill Rushman.
Hell, no!
Jesus Christ, where did they find you?
Ain't you been listening to me?
Aaron don't have the guts to do nothing.
It was me, boy.
- It was me.
- It was you.
- It was you. It was you.
- Yes, it was.
He come crying to me like always, stuttering and whining.
"I can't take it no more, Roy.
You got to help me.
"Please, please, Roy."
I said, "Shut your mouth, you little girl!
"Grow up. Be a man.
Take care of yourself."
- Be a man, yeah.
- Know what I'm saying?
So your name is Roy?
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Yeah.
What is it? Marty?
- Yeah.
- Hey, listen, Marty.
I'm dying for a smoke.
Do you have a cigarette on you?
- No, I quit.
- Fuck that.
I can't live without them. There's got to be a butt around here somewhere.
Roy.
Roy, tell me about Linda.
- Linda?
- Linda, yeah.
Well, who the fuck cares about Linda?
Well, I care about Linda.
I'd like to know about Linda.
That little tramp.
Let me tell you something.
Everybody had a piece of her, you know what I'm saying?
I mean, she had Aaron wrapped up so tight, he actually thought she was his girlfriend.
It was pathetic. She broke his heart.
So that's why you had to kill Rushman, because of the sex stuff.
You've seen the tape.
Answer me, you son of a bitch!
Do you think I'm playing with you?
I will break your fucking neck!
I'm going to ask you again.
Have you seen that tape?
I saw the tape.
Yeah, of course I saw the tape.
God damn it, God damn it.
I told him to get that tape.
I said, "Get the fucking tape.
It's motive, you asshole!"
This is going to fuck everything up, Marty.
Don't you show that to a goddamn person!
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. Yes.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. Shit.
- Aaron.
- Damn!
Mr. Vail?
Yeah, I'm right here, Aaron.
He did it. The little fuck did it.
How could I have missed that?
- Do I need stitches?
- No.
He didn't do it. Aaron has no idea what just happened in there.
I kept seeing all the signs, the big ones.
The abusive background, these repeated blackouts, the ellipses in thought.
He's ambidextrous.
That's what I was trying to tell you when you came in tonight.
Look, you may be thrilled by all this, but I'm fucked. I don't have a case.
It's textbook multiple personality disorder.
Put me on the stand. I'll testify.
He's insane.
I can't. I can't change plea in the middle of a trial.
The judge would never allow it.
Besides, insanity is the hardest thing to prove.
Okay.
My professional opinion?
This is not a criminal we're dealing with. It's a sick kid.
He's sitting in a cell, and it's not where he belongs.
You got an aspirin?
Come on, Connerman, ask it.
Ask what?
The question you wanted to ask me before.
I don't understand, Mr. Vail.
"How can you defend someone if you know they did it?
"How can you do that?
"How can you fucking defend these fucking scumbags?"
Isn鈥檛 that what you wanted to ask me?
It is, isn't it?
All those fucking coy questions, all that bullshit.
Bottom line is,
"How can you do what you do?"
You think it's the money, don't you?
The money's nice.
The money's very, very nice, Jack.
You know, the first thing I ask a new client is,
"You been saving up for a rainy day?
"Guess what? It's raining."
You think it's because I want to see my face on the cover of magazines?
My 15 seconds on TV? I love it.
I fucking love that shit. I really do, but guess what.
It's not it.
- You go to Las Vegas?
- Yeah.
I don't go to Vegas.
Why do you think I don't go to Vegas?
Marty, it's late. I think that we should both just get up and go...
Why gamble with money when you can gamble with people's lives?
That was a joke.
All right, I'll tell you.
I believe in the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty.
I believe in that notion because I choose to believe in the basic goodness of people.
I choose to believe that not all crimes are committed by bad people, and I try to understand that some very, very good people do some very bad things.
You know, when I was working for Shaughnessy,
I did something very, very bad. Maybe illegal. I was a prosecutor then.
This thing that I did, I was very upset by it, and I decided to leave.
So I left. I became a defending attorney.
The irony being that everyone assumes I'm fucking lying anyhow.
So I made myself this little promise that
I would reserve my lies for other than my public life.
You print any of this,
I'll sue your fucking ass.
All right, all right, so I made a little mistake.
No shit.
What do you want? Want a new suit?
I'll buy you a new suit.
You made a mistake?
You told us the third man did it.
So now you got your third man and a fourth man and a fifth man...
What are you going to do, Marty?
I don't know. I really fucked up here.
You were right.
So how are you gonna get him off?
I don't know.
What I know is, Aaron did not commit first-degree murder.
- Marty, he stabbed him a billion times...
- No, not Aaron.
To convict someone of a capital crime, the State must prove intent.
Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.
Yeah, but the only way to prove that is to change the plea to insanity, which we can't do mid-trial, unless you're planning on a career change.
I could've been mistaken, but I wasn't wrong.
Aaron is innocent. It's Roy who is guilty.
This kid doesn't need a lawyer.
He needs an exorcist.
Tom, you are so full of shit. You were not there, and you didn't see it.
He's one sick motherfucking boy, man, who's been fucked around his whole life by his father, by his priest.
This kid does not deserve to die, and it's our job to make sure that a jury believes he doesn't deserve to die.
- Okay.
- Okay. How do we do it?
By somehow introducing this whole abuse thing.
- The tape.
- What about the tape?
That's crazy. That gives him motive.
No, it looks like that, but it's...
No, actually, what it does is, it turns this whole thing around.
It gives concrete documentation of what Rushman did to this kid.
But we can't put it in. You know that.
But we're not going to.
Oh, fuck!
- Okay. Okay.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Who is this?
- You know damn well who it is.
- Barleycorn's, Marty. Now.
- Janet?
Cute porno. Part of your collection?
Hey.
Where did you get it? You steal it
- from the crime scene?
- I don't know anything about this tape.
- You are such a liar.
- Think about it.
- I have.
- Look, if this tape really has on it what you say it does, last thing I'd do is give it to you.
It gives you motive.
- You had to give it to me.
- Why?
You couldn't introduce it in court.
The jury would despise you for it, for dishonoring the Bishop's memory.
But if you get me to show it, motive or no motive, I'm the one who looks bad, and you gain sympathy for your poor little abused boy.
- You think so?
- I hate you.
Don't use it.
I have no intention of using it.
- The usual, Stu.
- You got it.
You're up to even more than that, aren't you?
I'm not up to anything.
You're opening a door, you think
I'm going to walk through it?
There's going to be a tiger on the other end, and I don't...
You know who'd be really upset if you used it?
- I just told you...
- Shaughnessy.
- Fuck him.
- Fuck him?
Fuck you.
Thanks a lot.
All right, if this is not your motive, what is?
I have motive.
Yeah, what is it?
I'm really gonna tell you.
Well, you better tell the jury pretty soon.
Time's running out.
Here you go.
You think you've got me.
You think because you know me as well as you do, you know how I think.
Well, I know how you think.
You know what I'm thinking?
What happened to your face?
I bumped it into a medicine cabinet.
No, Marty, that was a girl on her way out.
Maybe we should come back here later.
Later? Well, they close in 10 minutes.
No, after.
After the trial.
When we've got nothing to lose.
How can your timing be so good in a courtroom and so bad in real life?
I'll think about it later.
I hate you too much right now.
You got a visitor.
Here she comes.
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.
Janet.
Morning.
So where's the tape?
There's some pretty ugly stuff on that tape.
- Yes, there is.
- Who would've thought?
- Where did it come from?
- Landed on my front door last night.
- No note.
- Vail?
- Who else?
- Clever prick.
What do you think he's up to?
- I honestly don't know.
- Cut the crap, Janet.
You know him pretty goddamn well.
You were balling him, for Christ's sake.
- Where is it?
- At home.
I have some advice for you.
My advice for you, if you really have aspirations beyond this particular office, is to pick up that little handbag of yours, go home right now and destroy this tape you should've destroyed, like I did, the minute you received it.
You don't think Vail has a copy?
You don't think there's an original?
It's Stampler that's on trial, not the Catholic Church, and if you haven't found another motive to hang him on, then God help you.
All rise.
Please, sit down.
Madam Prosecutor.
Miss Venable.
The State calls Thomas Goodman.
Objection, Your Honor.
Prosecution knows full well that Mr. Goodman is my investigator in this case, and under the Work Product Rule, he can't be compelled to testify.
Permission to approach the bench,
Your Honor?
Granted.
Important evidence has just come into my possession which I believe this witness can authenticate.
That's Mr. Vail's privilege. If Mr. Vail doesn't want Mr. Goodman to testify,
Mr. Goodman doesn't testify.
Make a decision, Mr. Vail.
Mr. Goodman, have you ever been to my apartment?
- No.
- By that I mean my apartment building.
Allegedly.
I'm sorry, you're confused.
Either you have or you haven't.
"Allegedly" doesn't figure into it.
I have been there, yes.
- Why did you go there?
- I was delivering something.
For whom?
Martin Vail.
Mr. Vail sent you to deliver something to me.
- Yes.
- What was it?
A videotape.
Could this have been the tape you delivered for Mr. Vail?
I have a feeling it is, yes.
The People place this half-inch videocassette tape
- in evidence, Your Honor.
- So ordered. Bailiff, please index.
Now, where did Mr. Vail get this tape, if it is indeed the same one?
He took it from the closet of Archbishop Rushman.
- He stole it.
- No, no, he borrowed it.
Once I made the transfer for him,
I returned it, so...
Can you describe for me what's on this tape?
There was a sermon by Archbishop Rushman on it, a rehearsal of a sermon, I should say, followed by
- a kind of home movie.
- A home movie? Of what?
- Some altar boys.
- And?
- A girl.
- Doing what?
An altar-boy lesson of some kind?
Having sex.
Quiet.
A porno movie.
- Yes.
- Yes. Now.
How is it, do you think, that this tape, this porno tape, was in the Archbishop's closet in order for Mr. Vail to find it there?
- He was the... The director.
- Who was?
- Archbishop Rushman.
- Quiet in the court!
And was the defendant one of the altar boys performing in the Archbishop's home movie?
- Yes, he was.
- Was his girlfriend?
I believe her name is Linda Forbes.
Yes, she was.
And did it appear to you that the defendant was enjoying performing in this film with his girlfriend?
No, he does not.
I will not ask you, Mr. Goodman, if you think we have just uncovered motive here.
We will decide that for ourselves once we've all seen the videotape.
No further questions.
Does Defense wish to cross?
- No, Your Honor.
- Court's in recess.
Bailiff, please set up for the tape.
Mr. Goodman, you're excused.
Thanks for the advice.
- Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.
- Yes. Yes, she was.
- How'd you meet?
- We was both at the Savior House.
I was an altar boy, and she was working for Bishop Rushman.
Doing what?
Were you sleeping with anyone else at the time?
- No.
- Was she?
No.
Has she been to see you, Aaron?
- Yeah? No, I'm still here.
- No.
- What?
- Does that upset you?
Okay.
Mr. Vail, are you prepared to proceed with your first witness?
Yes, Your Honor.
The Defense calls John Shaughnessy.
The People object, Your Honor.
Mr. Shaughnessy has never been identified as a possible witness.
- Your Honor, may I approach?
- Yes, you may.
Thank you.
My client is on trial for his life, here.
He's always maintained that there was
- someone else in that bedroom.
- And you think Mr. Shaughnessy can somehow confirm that?
Your Honor, the Constitution of the United States takes precedence here, permitting the calling of any witness to promulgate evidence of innocence.
That's clearly stated in the Sixth Amendment.
It's also profound in Brady vs. Maryland.
Mr. Shaughnessy, do you serve on the board of an organization known as the Rushman Foundation?
I have the privilege to be an honorary board member.
Could you briefly explain the nature and purpose of this foundation?
The Rushman Foundation was founded by the late archbishop.
Its purpose is to invest in projects for the greater good of the community.
The greater good of the community, okay.
Now, would that be true in the case of the now bankrupt
- South River Housing Development?
- Yes.
Could you tell the court why the
South River project was abandoned?
There was a difference of opinion as to the costs.
Wasn't there also a difference of opinion between the investors and the late archbishop himself?
- I don't recall.
- Well...
What kind of money are we talking about here? I mean...
How much money, Mr. Shaughnessy, was invested in this failed
South River enterprise?
- $60 million.
- Quiet.
$60 million!
Wow, that's a lot of money.
You and the Archbishop have been friends for, what, 20 years?
I think it's safe to say the two of you knew each other really well.
That's right.
Were you surprised at the content of that tape
- that Miss Venable submitted?
- Yes, of course I was.
So you've never heard any allegations, charges against the Archbishop during that time?
Not that I recall, no.
No, especially since you were the
State's Attorney for the last 15 years, it'd be fair to say that you've supervised all the prosecutions in Cook County during that time, especially the prosecutions of all the prominent figures.
I also have a staff of 1,000 of the best prosecutors...
Yeah, yeah, but as State's Attorney, it was up to you, ultimately, to decide who would be indicted and who wouldn't.
- Yes.
- Yeah. Okay.
Let me just take you back now.
Let's go back to June, 1985.
Do you recall any allegations of sexual misconduct
- against the Archbishop at that time?
- I don't recall that, no.
No? Do you recall a young man by the name of Michael O'Donnell who came to the felony review unit at your office?
I have no idea what you're talking about,
- Counselor.
- You don't?
This is so confusing to me, because I have this document here from the Chicago Metropolitan
Police Department, and it says that, yes, Michael O'Donnell spoke to the supervisor of that unit over a period of two weeks, explaining to him, in graphic detail, sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Archbishop Rushman.
Quiet.
Isn鈥檛 it also true, Mr. State's Attorney, that you then decided that your friend,
Archbishop Rushman, was not going to stand trial for any of it?
He owed you big time, John.
You must have been really pissed off when he pulled out of South River.
What happened? What was it?
He just finally said,
"I can't take it anymore"? He said, "No!"
- Mr. Vail.
- So you and your investors...
- Mr. Vail.
- ...had 60 million reasons to kill him!
- You little cocksucker!
- That's it. Witness dismissed.
This court's in recess.
Vail, in my chambers now.
That's for Joey Pinero, you little shithead.
Start looking for a job.
If you think you can use my courtroom to wage personal vendettas and settle old scores, you are sorely mistaken.
I'm striking Shaughnessy's testimony from the record as irrelevant, and I'm holding you in contempt to the tune of $10,000.
So what you're telling me is, I can't get a fair trial in your courtroom, is that it?
Be very, very careful, Mr. Vail.
You're on dangerous ground here.
Fine, fine. You want me to make that check out to you, Judge?
Do you want me to take you off this case?
You're making a mockery of my courtroom, and I'm not going to allow it.
I suggest you start representing your client and stop representing yourself.
...do this later?
No, I want to stay with this for a minute.
- I'm feeling very, very tired.
- Yeah, I know.
Why does talking about Linda Forbes upset you?
It doesn't. I just...
- Okay, okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, you know what I can do with this thing?
How the fuck should I know?
Dr. Arrington, how much time have you spent with Aaron Stampler?
Around 60 hours.
And what did you find in the course of your evaluation?
I found that Mr. Stampler suffers from an acute disassociative condition, specifically, multiple personality disorder.
Objection, Your Honor.
Now, Dr. Arrington is only stating what she herself has personally observed.
- Your Honor.
- Counselors.
- Now, I know what you're doing.
- Will you excuse us for a minute?
Your Honor, if he wants to question his client's sanity...
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a medical basis for amnesia here.
That is not what he's doing.
He's saying he's crazy.
- Are you?
- No, I am not.
I'll allow you to proceed with this witness if you're very, very careful.
Absolutely. Yes.
Write down that he said that.
All right, where were we?
Now, could Aaron Stampler have been present during the murder of Archbishop Rushman
- and not remember it?
- Yes, he could.
Okay. Could you explain that, please?
Mr. Stampler's state at the time of the offense was such that his body could be present at a homicide and yet his mind would be unable to recall it.
- And how is that possible?
- The neurological mechanism that would make this possible began with the early abuse suffered at the hands of his father.
In defense, Aaron's psyche splintered and helped him to create two separate personalities.
- Your Honor.
- I didn't say it.
- I did not say it...
- You've been warned twice now.
Do you really wanna pursue this line of questioning?
And I suggest you think long and hard before answering.
Your Honor, just one last question.
All right, Dr. Arrington, in your opinion, is Aaron Stampler capable of murder?
No, he is not. He is far too traumatized to express normal anger and frustration.
He keeps his emotions repressed, which is why he created Roy, who is capable of such a crime.
- Objection, Your Honor.
- That's enough, Mr. Vail.
The jury will disregard this witness' last statement, as will the court.
- Thank you very much.
- Madam Prosecutor,
- do you wish to cross?
- You bet I do.
Since you brought it up, against the instructions of the court,
I'm curious to know, is multiple personality disorder your primary area of expertise?
It's not my primary field, no.
Is forensic psychiatry your primary area of expertise?
- No, I'm a neuropsychologist.
- I see.
So you have no forensic experience, and you're more of, let's say, an academic?
Then you will forgive this rather academic question.
I'm driving in my car, somebody cuts me off.
I think to myself,
"I could just kill that guy," but I don't, now do I?
- I would hope not.
- That's right.
Things happen to us. People wrong us, but we don't all go around inventing psychopaths to do our dirty work for us, now, do we, Doctor?
I'm not suggesting you suffer from multiple personality, Miss Venable.
- I'm saying Mr. Stampler does.
- Yes, I know. We heard.
You have also testified that you have met this...
What was his name again?
- Roy.
- Roy what?
- He didn't give a last name.
- I see.
Did this Roy tell you that he had murdered the Archbishop?
Mr. Vail was alone with him at the time.
I was watching through the window, but soon after that I was in the room and saw both Roy and his transformation back to Aaron.
Did you happen to tape this appearance of Aaron...
I'm sorry. I am sorry.
I just cannot get used to this name.
- Roy.
- Did you?
- No, the tape was off.
- Off?
So you have no record whatsoever of his appearance.
- No.
- No.
Does Aaron Stampler know the difference between right and wrong?
Yes, he does.
If Aaron Stampler butchered the Archbishop, would he know...
Objection, Your Honor.
If Aaron Stampler murdered the Archbishop,
- would he know he'd broken the law?
- Yes, he would, but it wasn't Aaron...
Yes, I know, Doctor. It was Roy.
That's all.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Witness may step down.
Miss Venable, if you would like to re-open the Prosecution's case and call the State's psychiatrist,
- I will certainly agree to it.
- No, I...
I don't think that's necessary,
Your Honor.
I think we all get the picture here.
Mr. Vail, are you ready to proceed?
Would you like a recess?
Roy?
Aaron.
Could you tell us a little about your relationship with Archbishop Rushman?
Well, he was like a father to me.
I loved him very much.
Why did you love him?
Why?
Well, he saved my life.
He was the only person who ever treated me like I was worth anything.
Stop your whining, you little girl.
Be a man.
Now, we've all seen that tape that you were in, Aaron.
How did that make you feel?
Did it change your feelings about Archbishop Rushman?
No.
He was a wonderful man.
So you didn't feel anger towards him about being forced to perform in that tape?
No, he did everything for me.
There wasn't nothing else
I could do for him, and he needed it.
Do you know someone named Roy?
No, I don't.
You heard Dr. Arrington's testimony about what she and I saw there at the jail.
Aaron, some pretty strange things going on there. Do you remember?
I heard what she said, but I don't remember any of that.
- No recollection?
- No, sir.
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?
No, sir, I did not.
Thank you.
Your witness.
Mr. Stampler, would you like some water?
- No, ma'am.
- You sure?
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Stampler, did you believe that the Archbishop wore masks?
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Do you think he acted one way in public and another way in private?
No, I didn't think that.
Isn鈥檛 that why you underlined the Hawthorne passage?
Mr. Stampler?
No, I did not underline that book.
- You didn't underline it?
- No, ma'am.
And you didn't carve the numbers referring to that passage into his chest?
No, no, ma'am, I did not. I told you I...
You loved him.
You loved him like a father.
Even though he made you and your girlfriend perform demeaning sexual acts for his own gratification.
No, you don't understand. He...
There was no other way for him to cast out his own demons.
- He needed it.
- He needed to get off, Aaron.
That's what he was doing.
That's what he needed you for, to perform like a circus animal.
- That was your function in his life.
- No.
Mr. Stampler, I'm gonna ask you straight, because I am tired, and I've had just about all I can take of this sordidness, and I wanna go home, and I wanna wash my hands, and I wanna forget all about you and Archbishop Rushman.
Did the Archbishop force you and your girlfriend and others to perform sexual acts while he watched? Yes or no?
- Yes, he did, but...
- Yes. Yes, he forced you.
He forced you using a threat of expulsion from Savior House and a life on the street with no heat and no water and no food.
He put you in front of a camera!
He made you take off your clothes!
And you don't think that that's another side?
Another face of a man that we all thought...
- No! No.
- Do you know what I would do if someone did that to me?
I would kill him. I wouldn't hesitate.
- No.
- I would stab him
78 times with a butcher knife!
I would chop off his fingers!
I would slash his throat open!
I would carve numbers into his chest!
I would gouge out his eyes!
I swear to God.
But that's me.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
- Excuse me?
- Hey, you look at me
- when I'm talking to you, bitch!
- Mr. Stampler.
- Fuck you, lady! Come here!
- That's it.
Order! Bailiff! Order!
Come here! You wanna play rough?
Let's play rough. Come on. Back off!
- Roy! Take it easy.
- Keep coming, asshole.
You'll see if I don't break her fucking neck.
- Roy, come here. I gotta talk to you.
- Fuck you, Marty!
- I'm walking out of here. Now, slow...
- It's me.
No! No! Don't you...
No!
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Don't even think of lighting that cigarette, Miss Venable.
- How's your neck?
- I'll live.
I could call a doctor.
Mr. Shaughnessy just called to inform me there will be no mistrial,
- as if that was his right.
- I can't believe that scumbag has the balls to call here.
No, thanks.
What matters to me is what you have to say.
Obviously, your case has been damaged.
In fairness to the Prosecution,
I would declare a mistrial, regardless of what
Monsieurs Shaughnessy and Vail think, if that's what you want.
The Prosecution doesn't wanna try this case again, even if it could, which it can't, at least not by me.
And I think I can guarantee you there's no one in the DA's office who will, so it's up to you.
I'm going to dismiss the jury in favor of a bench trial and a blind plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
The defendant will be remanded to Elgin for an evaluation period of 30 days.
Let them decide the term of his commitment.
Do either of you have a problem with that?
Your Honor, he'll be out in a month.
Take it up with the Legislature,
Miss Venable.
I'm going home.
- Your Honor.
- No, Mr. Vail,
I am not refunding your contempt fine, and the next time you wanna get a client off on insanity, you plead that way, or I'll have you disbarred.
- You okay?
- Am I okay? Do I seem okay?
I get attacked by this sick twist,
I've lost the case, I'm out of a job.
No, Marty. I'm not particularly okay, but, hey, you won, justice was done.
Who the hell cares, right?
Congratulations.
You knew, didn't you?
You knew if I went after him, he'd wig out up there.
Well, I knew he'd come out if he was threatened.
And who better to do that than me?
You used me.
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.
What did I use, by the way, that was so terrible?
I knew you'd do your job.
I knew you'd stand up to Shaughnessy.
I knew you'd try to win the case.
Now, what's wrong with that?
I lost my fucking job!
And that's good.
You should've left him years ago.
Christ, Marty, why is it you always think you know what's right for me?
Because I'm arrogant.
I'm very, very arrogant.
- You wanna dance?
- No.
- Sure?
- Yeah.
All you have to do is turn around.
No.
No.
I have to see my client.
- I'd like a minute alone with him.
- Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.
You okay?
My head hurts.
You don't remember what just happened?
- No?
- I lost time again.
Well, I got some good news.
They've agreed to stop the trial.
They're gonna be sending you to a hospital.
You can get the help you need.
Now, there's a very good chance you can get out someday soon.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
- I don't know what to say, Mr. Vail.
- That's all right, Aaron. That's okay.
I knew, the minute you came into my cell,
I knew everything was gonna be okay.
You saved my life.
Yeah.
I got to go.
- When will I see you again?
- Well, that's up to the courts now.
I don't want you to worry, Aaron.
I'm gonna stay on top of this, okay?
Thank you.
All right. You give me a call if you need to. Okay?
- I will.
- All right.
- Hey, Mr. Vail?
- Yeah.
Will you tell Miss Venable I'm sorry?
Tell her I hope her neck is okay.
Yeah.
- What did you just say?
- What?
You told me you don't remember.
You black out.
So how do you know about her neck?
Well, good for you, Marty.
I was gonna let it go.
You was looking so happy just now.
I was thinking...
But to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it,
'cause I have been dying to tell you.
I just didn't know who you'd wanna hear it from, you know.
I mean, Aaron or Roy, or Roy or Aaron.
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret, sort of a client-attorney privilege type of a secret. You know what I mean?
It don't matter who you hear it from.
It's the same story.
I just had to kill Linda, Mr. Vail.
That cunt just got what she deserved.
But cutting up that son of a bitch Rushman, that was just a fucking work of art.
You're good. You are really good.
Yeah, I did get caught, though, didn't I?
So there never...
There never was a Roy?
Jesus Christ, Marty. If that's what you think, I'm disappointed in you.
I don't mind telling you.
There never was an Aaron, Counselor.
Come on, Marty, I thought you had it figured there at the end.
The way you put me on the stand like that, that was fucking brilliant, Marty.
And that whole thing, that, "Act like a man,"
Jesus, I knew exactly what you wanted from me.
It was like we were dancing, Marty!
- Guard.
- Come on. Don't be like that, Marty.
We did it, man. We fucking did it.
We're a great team, you and me.
You think I could've done this without you?
You're just feeling a little anger here because you started to care about old Aaron. I can understand that, but, you know, love hurts, Marty.
What can I say?
Hey, I'm just kidding, bud!
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!
What else was I supposed to do?
Hey, you're gonna thank me down the road,
'cause this is gonna toughen you right up, Martin Vail!
N-- My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's--
Yeah. You are? Okay!
Um, oh, there you are!
Okay, okay.
I'll see you in a minute!
Bye.
- Who's that?
- That's my analyst!
- He's coming to visit me.
- He what?
- Oh, my God. He's coming over.
- Sondra, thanks.
- Oh, thanks a lot! Nothing!
- What's the matter? What?
If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a nice afternoon together...
- maybe have dinner.
- Well, we can. Oh, don't worry.
Don't be upset.
You can stay here.
- Really.
- You just don't understand, do you?
- I don't.
- Nobody appreciates you the way that I do.
- People just use you, and you don't even see it.
- Oh, don't be upset.
That's more like it. Ciao.
Oh, my God.
- Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.
- Hi.
- I didn't just walk in on my own.
- Oh... no.
- That was my, um--
- That was my girlfriend, Bonnie. Yeah.
- Bonnie. Yes.
- Please, come in.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.
- You think so? Thank you.
A lot of nice, nice things.
A lot of nice art.
What did you come here for?
Well, I feel like
I have so much... so much catching up to do with all of you.
And I know that you're very close with Richie.
And I was wondering if you could tell me anything that might help me...
- understand him a little better.
- Richie's... my little baby.
His brother Dale thinks that your "Iittle baby"...
- should be taken out of therapy.
- That's insane!
I think it's a mistake too.
That Dale is a dangerous bastard.
But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal.
There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year ago.
Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you?
I don't have much to tell.
Richie's okay.
He's sweet.
Did you know that he was... molested as a child?
No, I didn't know that.
- It's sticking out all over.
- It's fashionable.
I mean, it pays well.
At least, you know, you can write a book, go on Oprah.
That was quite a show he gave us in group.
- You think Richie has a violent streak?
Oh.
Let's cut to the chase.
Richie did not kill Bob Moore.
You know... it's really swell.
Snooping around here... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while pretending to help your patients?
- You really think that
I don't care about Richie?
- Richie wouldn't hurt a fly!
Why don't you take a look at someone dangerous.
Why don't you take a look at someone who could do it!
- Why don't you take a look at Clark!
- Clark?
Clark! Clark!
Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature!
I heard him screaming one night at Bob.
It made the hairs on my neck stand up!
Anyway...
I hope that they fry... whoever did it, and it takes a really long time.
And then--
And then a fuse blows.
They have to start all over again.
Wow! That's my trainer.
I gotta go.
I gotta get the door.
- This is my trainer, Chris.
- Hi.
Bye-bye.
I don't feel like lifting weights today.
- Okay.
- Let's do something else.
Hey! ls this Dale Dexter's shop here?
Excuse me.
- Hello.
- Did you go to the house?
Yeah.
Nobody was home.
- I would have phoned a--
I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone number in our file.
No problem.
So, uh, did you make up your mind?
After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another psychiatrist?
No.
No, we moved.
Richie went to school.
- Everything was fine.
- Well... that's the problem, Dale.
I look at Richie, and I don't see that everything is fine.
I see a kid that's on the brink.
A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head.
Sometimes they just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain is gonna paralyze the person.
- That's Richie.
- What's the bullet?
Whatever it was,
I got him away.
- You want to talk about that?
- No.
I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let the demons rest.
You dig around in Richie's head, he's gonna blow up in your face.
- You think he's violent?
- Not with me.
I think you're making a mistake, Dale.
This is not the time to take Richie out of therapy.
- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
- Jesus Christ.
One of you is the same as another.
Yeah.
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer?
- Yes.
Hi, I'm Bill Capa.
I'm a doctor.
- I tracked you down through the Psychiatric lnstitute.
- How very enterprising of you.
Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr. Niedelmeyer.
My husband died last year.
If it makes you feel better, he suffered a lot.
Well, anyway, it made me feel better.
I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr. Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie Dexter.
- Why don't you leave me alone?
- If I could just ask you a few questions.
- You get out of here before I call the police!
- Just a few questions.
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer--
- Get out of here!
Fifty-eight.
Now, if I'm not mistaken...
Last week there were
59 books on the shelf... and this week there are only
58 books on the shelf, so--
Clark... what's the ashtray situation?
Three. Not four, as recommended.
There are three chairs and five assorted sofas.
- Okay, let's get started.
- ...an emotional tar baby.
Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and challenging topic.
- Sex.
- More or less.
You see, the primary romantic relationship... in our life is often a symptom of our illness.
- Glad I wore my rubber pants.
We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over every time we choose a new mate.
So... if you had a magic wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change your partner...
Sondra, how would you make them different?
What's wrong?
What's missing?
- Now?
- You need a minute to think about it?
She's totally forgot her Rolodex.
- Sorry, sorry.
Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now.
The last one sort of went to pieces.
If you enjoy sex... a man thinks you're doing it with everybody.
- He was jealous.
- That's right.
And I was as good as gold.
Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires onto you.
This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in his pants.
- Anyway, I do have this girlfriend.
She really makes me laugh.
A wish list.
- I wish... she was a guy.
- Fair enough.
Casey, what do you got for us?
Well... I met this girl about a month ago.
I've painted every inch of her in detail.
She's the best model I've ever seen.
Completely uninhibited.
- Does whatever I ask no matter how--
- I'll bet she does.
That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem comes in.
It's what you see beneath the skin... when you study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does.
I see a transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could ever, ever imagine.
How does this woman feel about you?
She thinks I'm the living end because I've got talent.
But, I mean, what's talent?
Kick a garbage can... starving artists crawl out, right?
But there's only one, unique her.
And, uh, I think it's love, you know?
And, um...
I don't know what to do about that.
Do you think she loves you?
No. No.
Do you care, Casey?
I don't know.
I don't know.
He's a romantic.
He loves the suffering.
Maybe being who I am...
I have no choice.
- Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.
- I agree.
- Buck, what do you got?
- Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.
It's not a contest.
Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray?
Thanks a lot.
Forget it.
You want to share something, share the ashtray.
I got something in my life, something new.
You know, she's young.
Auburn hair, 5'5", 105.
Pretty as hell.
I see her on weekends.
I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married to him.
Anything else you'd like to tell us?
She doesn't mind the gray, you know.
She's fragile... you know?
It's like she's running through my fingers.
Two people I loved died.
I never thought that
I could feel anything.
Good, Buck.
Richie. How 'bout you?
I don't have, really, relationships.
- I have m-my brother.
- Okay. You want to talk about him?
H-He worries a-a lot about me.
And he l-loves me.
But I-- I wish he didn't...
Love me so m--so much sometimes.
I wish I-I had more of a l-life.
And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but I'm-I'm not.
- A-And I don't want to be.
- What would you like to be?
I'd like t-to be a w-woman.
Have you seen a doctor?
Yeah.
- So the next step is the chop.
- Thank you, Buck.
- Anything else you'd like to tell us, Richie?
- Nope.
Very good.
Hi, Clark. What would you change about your partner?
Um, I think
I'll pass... today.
Excuse me.
You think you're gonna pass today?
Don't you think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group?
I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today?
Well, Sondra, I have my little problems...
- but I don't s-see how it's your business...
- Your "little problems"?
- to decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.
- Ah, I see.
You're smiling.
Is that a smile?
You think this is funny?
Look at you.
Just look at you.
Look at your hair.
Who do you think you are? Huh?
You think you're
God's gift to women?
Let me tell you something.
You are nothing.
Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal coward!
- And I'll tell you what your little fucking problems are--
- Oh, shut up! Shut up, shut up!
You promiscuous cunt!
And if you must know,
I do have somebody in my life!
Black, emotional hole, unattractive me!
You can say that again.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!
- Is this what you call
"treatment failure"?
Well, it's not a total loss.
He left without counting everything.
- Come on!
- Hey, right here! Hit it!
So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough.
I had to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of pages in each deposition.
- So you were fired.
- Yes.
In effect.
Obsessive-compulsive.
Medical leave.
"Just please, please don't come back."
I do apologize for my outburst in group.
You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?
I'm very fond of Sondra.
More than that, perhaps.
Sondra is... a very warmhearted woman, but--
Tissues. Panty hose.
CDs put back in the rack without cases.
Frying pans with coagulating grease.
Cotton balls.
Cotton balls.
I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman used.
Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the shower.
Chewed gum in the ashtrays.
I made a list.
There were 22 items
I couldn't take.
It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to your keen sense of order.
I found someone.
This woman thinks
I'm messy.
It's perfect.
She comes, she goes.
I don't even know she's been except for the faint smell of perfume.
Nice.
And what does Sondra think of this woman?
Take a look at this.
Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming.
The next day she came back, did this to my friend's dress.
I'm terrified to go near the woman.
Hello?
-Hello, this is Bill Capa.
- Hey, pukeface.
Look around. Can't you see me?
I'm in the red car.
You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr. Shithead Capa.
Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?
Suck my tinkertoy, you faggot cretin...
- after you suck my scalpel, Doctor.
- Goddamn it!
- Fuck you!
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.
- Christ!
Fuck you!
Get the-- You--
Ohh! Get the fuck--
Hey! You wanna die!
-Huh? You wanna die?
I told you to stay the fuck out of it.
Hey.? Como esta? Gracias.
- I almost killed somebody out there.
I mean, I had that car wedged right on the railroad tracks.
Christ, man.
It's a spooky feeling.
Like mainlining adrenalin, huh?
The rush is really something, huh?
See? You're my kind of guy!
You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday group?
Yeah, sure.
Can stand a little more pain.
Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in intensive care.
What'd she do?
Spill some wine on the rug?
Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a fork.
- She must have been having dinner.
One of her husbands died of unnatural causes.
Probably lost some body fluids.
And that, that kid Richie.
That Richie's been busted for drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the house on fire.
So what do you think of that?
I think it's good.
They should learn to assert themselves.
Hey, the house is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up and your legs spread!
- What the hell is this?
- Happy birthday, Hector!
Hey, Martinez, come on out!
We got something for you!
- Martinez, happy birthday, man!
- Happy birthday!
@ For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow @
@ Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny @
- @ For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good-- @@
- If I had known it was your birthday,
I'd have come by tomorrow.
- Me too.
@ Estas sonlas mananitas @
- @ Que cantaba el Rey David @-
Oy. Oigan, ivengana buscar el cake!
- Better get your cake.
- iVengan a buscar el cake!
- Everybody inside!
How come you didn't mention Buck?
There wasn't anything on him.
You caught meat a bad time.
Can we get in out of the rain?
Have a seat.
I don't like guns.
- Oh, shit!
- Was it raining like this that night?
- Yeah.
We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter.
This guy comes out wavin', "Stop!"
So I slow down.
My wife said,
"No, not here, Buck.
It's a bad neighborhood.
Besides, the baby's asleep in the back."
And I said, "Bad neighborhood, nothing." So I stopped.
Never even made it to the other car.
I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes wouldn't open. I--
- Oh, man!
The rain brought me around.
This heavy, heavy rain.
And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull my way up and--
There are two lateral shots... to the head for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my daughter.
Oh, Jesus, God!
Oh, Jesus.
They got, uh--
They got $31.
- The rain nails me every time, man.
- Did they ever find out who did it?
- No.
I think it was some kind of payback for something.
But that's a long story.
Officer Anderson.
What can I do for you?
It's Dr. Bill Capa.
Remember me?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The Bob Moore murder case.
- I need to talk to you.
- I hope you're an early riser.
I get off at 6:00.
- Okay.
Hey.
Busy day?
Can I get you something?
No? Okay.
Oh! I forgot about that!
How did you get in here?
Last time I was here, I stole the key.
It was by the door.
- What about the alarm?
- Oh!
- I never thought about that.
- It didn't go off?
No.
Um, did I make a mistake?
You have someone in the car?
No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car!
People are getting killed around here!
You walk around like it's goddamn Disneyland!
What if something were to happen to you?
I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's all.
You don't look too happy to see me.
This is my happiness mode.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.
This is a very nice surprise.
- Really nice.
I'm sorry.
I'll never take a risk like that again.
Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me...
- your phone number.
Christ, Capa!
I can't have people tying up the phone lines.
I'm trying to run a business here.
General Patton comes out
They are always in the swamps
Oh! Oh, always in the deep abyss
And now... always having to run
- He's up in the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen.
- Fire one. Fire-- Oh!
A direct hit!
- Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.
- Oh.
Yeah?
- It's goin' away.
- How's the submarine fleet?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please.
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Oh, you're chicken.
- I gotta be up--
- You're chicken.
- I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.
- You're chicken, chicken.
Nobody told me Buck was one of your patients.
- "Nobody," Like Martinez?
- Right.
That's the same "nobody" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.
Fucking Martinez.
That's a can of worms you don't want to mess with.
- What about Buck?
- Hey, look, you gotta promise... if I tell you what I know about this shit, it stays between me and you.
And you never heard it from me, okay? Two, Angelo.
- Why?
- Why?
- Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex?
- Right.
Fucking asshole.
I don't want to spend the rest of my career getting pissed on from above, okay?
- Okay.-
Martinez was nailin'
Buck's wife.
- Holy shit.
- Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics.
And those guys usually stick together like shit on a shirt... so who knows how long it's been going on. Anyway, one day, it came out.
In the station, they had this big fight in front of everybody.
Two days later,
Buck's wife gets blown away.
Jesus Christ!
Was there an investigation?
Of course there was an investigation.
Martinez was a suspect.
Buck was a suspect.
I mean nobody figured Buck forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.
- What do you think?
- I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the street.
This was just payback for both of 'em.
Hi, this is Casey.
- Can't get to the phone right now, but please leave a message.
Casey, it's Bill Capa. I got your message and, sure, I can make it today.
- Are you there?
- Hey!
What-- What the hell are you doing here?
Hello? Listen,
Casey, y-you sounded a little upset.
Just hang in there, okay?
- Let me get this, huh? No?
- I'll be by this morning.
- So I'll see you in 30.
- Well, you think you can do it in 30?
- Casey!
Casey!
Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Casey!
Hey!
Casey!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Shit!
- I love this song.
- I know.
- You girls want to go dancing?
- Yeah. We're going to a party.
- Hi.
- Hi--
Well, pardon me!
What are you doing?
- Wha-- No!
Don't! Don't!
@ Out all night
Lady did @
@ When nobody else would @
@ Lady did
And she did it real good @
- @ Once was not enough @
- Ah!
- Sondra, go!
@ Tell me, Katie
What would your mama say @
Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.
- Sondra, come here.
Oh, come here. My God!-
- Oh, my God!
-These are your neighbors!
-They do this all the time.
- Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!
- They're gonna see you!
-Oh, I don't believe it!
-Oh, this is the part! This is the part!
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh!
- Believe me, they can fuck.
Oh, I can't watch thisanymore.
I didn't see anything.
Oh, Sondra, go.
I love this song.
Yeah.
Sondra, through the window!
Look! Look!
- Oh, what are they doing now?
- I can't tell.
- Are they gonna do it? No!
- My God!
It's gonna happen right now.
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, champagne.
- Mmm.
No, no, Sondra.
I can't. I can't.
Why? It's wonderful.
- Sondra, I'm a jinx.
- No. We can cancel each other out.
No.
I'm not who you think I am.
Oh, God, I'm in love with somebody and it's all falling apart.
- I'm sorry.
- Look, the sky isn't falling down.
- Yes, it is.
- No.
Let's get that silly thing off your head. There.
I love your brown hair.
- Who is it?
I'm back.
Here she comes.
Wearing a backpack on her back... making her look even younger than she is.
She falls into his arms.
And they kiss.
Oh, God.
I'm so glad that you're here.
I didn't know if you'd be in.
I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.
Yeah?
- So, what color are my nipples?
- Oh, God.
To be normal like this all the time.
Oh, God, this is better than normal.
This is much better than normal.
It's just driving me crazy, that's all.
I mean, I don't really know you-- who you are... what you do... if you're safe, when you're coming by.
You have all the power.
I just sit around here and wait for you.
- You do?
- Yeah.
I mean, other things happen, but... in the "what I wait for" department, you're it.
Oh, my.
Bob's wife.
My ex-wife.
- She's pretty.
- Pretty fucked up.
Oh, God.
I forget that he's dead.
He looks so young here.
God, how long ago were these taken?
- Ten years ago.
- Really?
Do you have anything more recent?
Maybe. Hold on.
I don't know why he keptthis hidden back here except maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead as they were pretending.
- I don't know who these people are.
- No. It's morbid.
I don't want to see anymore.
Let's go outside.
Let's pretend it's Sunday.
Yeah? You wanna?
One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered.
What?
The painter.
- Casey.
- Were you there?
- A little bit after.
- What did you see?
You don't want to know.
About a half hour before group.
I'm gonna get a shower.
- You gonna be okay out here?
- Yeah.
- Rose.
- Oh! Oh!
Rose! Rose!
Rose! Jesus!
2ASB--
2ASB185. 2ASB185.
- 2ASB...
Oh! Stupid, crazy bastard!
They'll give anybody a license!
Five and six are 31.
Seven, seven, that makes 45.
And that will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will be 45, no matter what.
And then this is five, and that makes 50. And nine is 59.
Now that's odd. That's really odd.
Now there's 59 again.
- What?
- Well, last week... there were 58 books on the bookshelf where there is always... and I mean always, 59 books, and this week there are 59 again, so I don't--
- Which one, Sondra?-
I didn't read any of it. Really.
- I felt so bad when I got it home.
I couldn't help myself.
- Which one, Sondra?
It-- The Van Gogh.
But I didn't read any of it.
- Honestly, I promise!
- What did I do?
I was right about the threats from the Monday group.
This cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim becomes tomorrow's monster.
Today's the day.
Hi.
Hi, Bill.
Hi, Buck.
Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think we should get started.
- That's typical. Oh, shit!
- Buck, are you all right?
- It's none of your fucking business.
- You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.
- I'd like to start, if I may.
I'd like to apologize to the group and Sondra.
Everything that you said last week in group was right, and that's why I lost my temper.
Uh, the young lady that
I mentioned last week... that relationship has been terminated.
No reason and no hope.
She just, just called... and told me, and that's it.
"The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a normal character together, can become anything.
Amorality frees her to be universally perfect.
A charming chameleon with a scorpion's tail."
Do any of you recognize-- recognize this woman?
Oh, my God! Oh!
This is my girlfriend.
This is Bonnie.
- Give me that!
- This your Bonnie?
This is your Bonnie? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.
The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with?
This is the one that's saving you from yourself?
- Your shopping mall hag?
- Shut up.
- The one that makes you smile?
- Shut up!
- The one that you wish was a man?
- What are you getting at, Buck?
- That Bonnie? ls that it?
- That's right, that's it.
- That's right, That's right.
- Sondra... this is my Bonnie.
You're lying.
You're lying.
You're lying.
You're lying!
I don't believe you!
- Let me see that.
- Fuckin' A!
- Well, yes, of course.
This is the woman that I've been talking about. This is my Bonnie.
- Goddamn it, Buck!
Don't do that! Do not do that!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You're lying to me!
Why are you lying to me?
- Stop acting like an--
- Like an emotional child!
- Goddamn tar baby!
- You're making it up!
You're making it up!
- Nobody's making anything up...
- and stop it, stop it, stop it!
- Stop it!
Quit it!
You're crumpling the picture up!
- I want you to stop!
You're a little brat!
- Fuck it!
You have the emotions of a styrofoam cup!
- You calm down, and you stop--
- Where's the picture?
How in the name of God... could all of you be going out with the same woman and not know?
Not have a clue?
Including you,
Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst?
Not to mention Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself in front of his expensive painting.
I'm gonna call the Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this woman deserves credit.
And I'm gonna make sure that all of your names are included... so you can all share in the glory.
Well, you should know something about sharing, huh, Hector?
I mean, you and Buck must have shared some very tender moments... discussing his wife. Huh?
- Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- What truth is that?
Why didn't you tell me
Buck was a cop... not to mention a suspect in a murder case?
- Not to mention you, goddamn it.
- Because...
I'm not your patient, and I don't have to tell you shit!
That's right, you don't have to tell me shit! Fuckin' tell me anything, do you?
- Why won't somebody tell me some fucking truth?
- Get the fuck out of here!
One fuckin' thing!
Can you do that, Buck?
- You really know how to pick your women, you know that?
- I know you can't...
- you lyin' sack of shit!
You can't fuckin' do it!
- Listen.
- After my wife died,
I wanted to slaughter this cocksucker!
- Don't! No more!
But I realized we both loved her.
It became a, sort of a bond between us.
Isn't that right, Hector? lsn't it? Hector!
Jesus God! I never got the chance to forgive her.
So I forgave him instead.
All right!
So much for the famous fucking Monday group!
Now we have a suspect with a tattoo on her ass and no address.
Now the cops need your help.
What about the car?
- Anybody around here wrote down the license plates numbers?
- "The license plates numbers"?
- We didn't even--
- Huh?
- Well, I didn't think to-to-to write it down.
- Hey, welcome back to L.A., Miss Brown.
- Thanks. Put my bags in my room.
Dr. Ashland from New York with the psychiatric convention.
Dr. Ashland? In the health club.
I don't think she is a sociopath.
Well, then how about something simple and snappy like a multiple personality disorder?
You've fallen into a trap.
You are not well.
She is not well.
And to you, it feels like a bond.
She's been acting this thing out as if...
- it's the only way for her to have a life.
- Or lives.
- You really want to go on seeing her, do you?
- Yes, I want to see her.
In a, a non-professional sense?
In every sense.
I don't have your magical tuning fork.
All I know is that two people are dead... and she seems an excellent suspect.
Bill, salmon swim upstream to mate and die.
- And so do men.
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Anderson!
- Hey, man, how ya doin'?
- I need your help with something.
I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a space right in front of mine.
- A beautiful woman?
- Stunning.
Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the headlight on my car.
- Uh-oh. Drives away, right?
- I don't even think she knew what she did.
But you'd like to meet her?
All right, um, I'll see what I can do.
You got the license number?
- Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.
- Sure.
Damn!
- I ought to shoot you!
- I came to make amends.
- So make 'em, loudmouth!
- I just spoke to Bill Capa.
This license plate might belong to our mystery lady.
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer!
It's Dr. Capa again.
- You leave me alone!
Get away from here!
- I need your help, please!
- Why are you torturing me like this?
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please!
- I need you to listen to me!
- My best friend was killed.
He was stabbed with a knife...
- You get out of my house!
- 38 times in the chest!
- You-You go away!
Another patient was bled to death!
I think that I might be next!
- Go away!
- I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer!
- What are you hiding from me?
What is it?
- Nothing.
- Why won't you tell me the truth?
Put that phone down.
- I'm calling the police!
-Put the phone down! Put the phone down!
-Please!
What kind of twisted creature are you?
I've never done anything to you.
- My patient Richie is involved--
- Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke?
- If you just help me--
- Richie Dexter is dead!
He killed himself four years ago.
Why?
Because he couldn't stand... what my husband was doing to him.
He hung himself with a belt.
He was 12.
I didn't know!
I mean, how could I know?
Nobody knew.
What about the family?
He is survived by his brother, Dale.
If Richie Dexter were alive today... he'd be 16 years old.
He also had a sister, Rose.
Richie.
- Jesus Christ!
What did he--
What did he do to you?
W-What I... d-deserved.
Y-You shouldn't be here.
Get away from me.
Richie--
Richie...
I have to see Rose.
- I need her.
Get away from me, please!
You'll make it worse!
- Where's Dale?
- I-I don't know, but he'll be back!
I-I don't know where he is.
Was this your idea, to become Richie?
No! No!
I-lt happened.
It just happened.
What? What happened, Rose? Please.
- I need to know.
- When Richie died...
Dale buried the body and then he said, "Richie, come here."
And I told him, I told him,
"My name is Rose!"
He slapped me so hard,
I couldn't get up.
A-And he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore.
- I was Richie from then on.
- What happened to Rose?
After a while, I forgot about Rose.
- Then Richie got busted.
- And you had to come to group.
They were our world.
- They were our family.
- But then what?
Rose started coming back?
No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out.
- Bonnie was first.
- Oh, honey.
Help me, please!
Help me.
Jesus! Oh, my God!
Oh! Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
That crazy bastard!
Oh, God!
- Rose!
Get away f-from me!
Rose, come back! Richie!
Richie, leave her alone!
I never get to be out a-anymore.
Rose. Come on.
- And then I met you and the fog...
- started to lift.
- It did. It did.
- I know. Come on, let's go.
- Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh.
Come here.
Here we go.
Here we go. Let's move.
- Oh!
- Back up!
- No! No, Dale, don't!
- Get back! Get back!
- Dale, no!
Quick tongue, slow wit.
Deadly, Doctor.
Deadly.
Hi, Dale.
You fucking daffodil.
Put that toy down.
Put it in the toolbox. Now!
I got .45 caliber nails in this gun!
- What are you doing here, Martinez?
- Aren't you glad I'm here?
Anderson snitched you out! That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop!
- Let that be your psych lesson for the day!
Go! Run!
- Go! Get over there! Get over there!
- No! No!
Go! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Go!
Let's go!
- No! Get out!
- Come on! Come on!
You fucking son of a bitch!
You really fucked it up, didn't ya?
- Got your little brother killed.
- No!
- You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.
- No, I saved him!
- You knew what was happening...
- I didn't know!
- because it happened to you before!
- Would you goddamn shut up?
Could have saved your little brother, but he killed himself.
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
- You failed, Dale.
And you made
Rose become Richie!
- Oh, you're smart. You're really smart.
- Bob Moore was smart, but I put a stop to that.
- Yeah, you did.
Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?
Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh?
- Y-You can't keep your fucking hands off of us.
- Huh? Always pokin' and pushin'. Huh?
Why'd you do it, Dale?
Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after night.
Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her... gonna recognize
Richie in group.
Well, I might have missed old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.
- And now--
I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.
The inspiration of madness, Dale.
The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.
- Richie.
My name is--
My name is Rose.
- No! No!
No!
No!
Rose!
Rose!
Come back! Rose!
- Rose!
Rose! Stop!
- Rose!
Wait!
Rose!
- Don't!
- For God's sakes, don't jump!
- Rose!
- No!
- Rose! Stop!
- No!
- No.
No!
- Wait!
- Why?
Rose! No! Stop, please!
- Just stay there!
- It's too late.
I've gone too far.
I can't go back.
If you go, I go!
I swear to God!
- I swear to God.
- Why would you do that?
Please, God, just come over here.
I don't want you to die.
Just give me your hand. Take a risk!
There's no risk in dying.
- Come on.
- Oh, Capa.
- Come on.
- I-- No--
- No!
- Capa!
No!
Come on.
Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils!
- You gonna leave me hanging here all night, huh?
Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos!
- Get me some fucking Band-Aids!
Come on, you fucking daffodils!
Get me out of here!

Hey! You gonna spend the night up there?
You and little Miss Fender Bender?
What is the purpose of your trip, please?
Business.
Thank you and welcome to St. Estéphe.
What is the purpose of your trip, please?
May I see these Havana's, please?
- Relax.
- I'll relax after the dog and pony show.
- Will you put that thing away, Joe?
- Just a minute.
Mr. Ross?
- Susan.
- Susan. You on the plane?
In the cheap seats. I'm just thrilled the company sent me here at all.
Let me help you with that.
On, no, Mr. Ross, I promised
Mr. Klein nobody touches this but me.
- Let me just get this.
- You are a real boy scout.
- That's a compliment indeed.
- They told me we started here.
- It's true.
- Nothing sensitive in that.
Absolutely not.
Come on.
The process... and by means of the process to control the global market.
- And this process is complete?
- It's near completion.
- Near completion?
- Very near. This team, which Mr. Ross--
- Team?
- The team.
And I think if I may,
Mr. Klein...
I would like to state that the work and the inspiration for the process was--
Thank you, George.
I know you'll understand when
I say that's neither here nor there.
These gentlemen have come down to hear the good news.
The good news is control of the market.
- How are we gonna do that, Mr. Ross?
- Some information is in front of you.
We don't want to get too specific for security reasons.
My task is to tell you what those things I can in Layman's language.
I think I can break it down sufficiently to give you a pretty firm idea.
- This process--
- Yes.
How long could we hold on to it before the competition steals it?
We defend it, of course, tooth and nail.
This is a proprietary process.
Of course, after the fact.
But the competition--
The question is, if we get into it, what do we own?
You're asking us to consider making a vast investment.
Before we take this before the stockholders' meeting...
I want to know, what do we own?
- Speak to the point.
- Thank you, I will.
Without our actual data, without the formula... the Japanese, or anyone else for that matter, would have nothing.
Should you give us the go-ahead, their actual--
The legal issues are these:
We have both the de facto and the de jure copyright of that process.
Even if they should engage in piracy, their research and development time...
- Their catch-up time.
- would put them back-- George?
- Three?
- Three to five years.
What I want to know is, who much money will we make?
In that three-to-five-year period... a conservative projection is we're gonna generate for the company... a windfall somewhere on the order of--
- I'd like to take this opportunity--
- What is it, Joe?
If I might-- They were kind enough to mention the stockholders' meeting.
But if we could discuss the exact terms of--
- Of your--
- Of my bonus.
That is, my participation in it.
This thing goes, there's gonna be more than enough to go around.
Are you kidding? You did good in there. I'm not gonna forget it.
- Thank you.
- Neither are they.
- But my exact question is--
- How much?
I'm in the same position as you.
They keep me in the dark too.
Yes, they do.
Do you need a couple of bucks for your rent?
For my rent?
I can't say that I do, sir.
I'll tell you what.
Frankly, I'm here to enjoy myself.
That's why we brought you fellows down.
Give you a little perk.
Now you wanna talk business?
New York, my office.
Any time.
And Joe, why don't you buy yourself some new clothes?
Give yourself a holiday.
As you see, Joe.
Lots to do down here.
See you in New York.
Both the room charges and the incidentals--
- The fax said the incidental expenses--
- I'm just the new girl.
- I'll just be a moment.
- Thanks.
Your traveler's checks are in U.S. dollars?
- That's right.
- Some clambake, huh?
- I'll need you to sign these.
- Gabrielle, you have to change the tape.
Change it?
Don't you just rerecord them?
- No, we save all the tapes.
- What do you keep them for?
Insurance company demands it.
People waterskiing and so on.
In case of a suit.
Lot of money, sir.
They give you a better exchange at the bank.
Oh, well, I suppose I should have done it that way, but... that's all right.
Hello. Been shopping, Mr. Ross?
If you want, as long as we're here-- thank you-- you could call me Joe.
Yeah, as long as I didn't take that as inducement... to further intimacy.
- Well--
- I'll call you Joe down here then.
How--
How'd the meeting go?
Something big, huh? That's what they all think back at home.
- Could be something big.
- What is it?
- Sworn to secrecy.
- Something big. Sworn to secrecy.
- Everybody's smokin' a cigar.
- Things seem to be going our way.
Did you know the Caribbean is the number one honeymoon destination... for young Japanese?
- I didn't know that.
- Well, it is.
- Long way to come.
- Must be because it's so romantic.
Aha.
Take a picture, sir?
Sure.
The security of the process.
There's only one copy of the process.
It's in New York.
- I see.
- The answer you're after--
Beats workin', doesn't it?
One last shot. Show 'em back at the office. Our day in paradise.
- Sure.
- Let's see those ivories!
A friendly smile, a tropical isle.
- I'll take you too.
- Thanks.
Chris, I left the log on the pilot seat.
You're a real gent.
See ya.
I'll give you $1,000 for that camera.
Beg your pardon?
I said, I will give you
$1,000 if give me that camera.
Are you asking a favor of me?
Is that the idea?
Because if it's important to you, why don't you take the camera as a gift?
Why don't you take it?
There you go.
My gift to you.
Excuse me.
What is this thing that brought you down here?
A very hush-hush, secret development.
But I'm so low down on the food chain.
I've only been there a month.
- Hello, Joe. I was just--
- Yeah, we're secret agents down here.
Super-rich and powerful.
Reforming the world.
- Full of priceless information.
- Everybody on vacation's got a story.
- Isn't it?
- That's right.
Everybody needs to feel important.
What do you do?
Me? I'm with the FBI.
I know.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Not that I know anything.
You're right. You know what I have?
A secretary mentality.
- That's right. Might be a good idea--
- Not that anyone tells me anything.
I'm just here to fetch and carry.
"Send the new girl."
No. It's not a big thing.
Just don't have to mention it.
Thanks.
- Somebody's got a crush on you.
- I ain't lookin' for an office romance.
All I want is an umbrella in my drink.
Your ship comes in, you're gonna be whisking them away like flies, lad.
- Just like flies.
- Ship comes in!
Nice shirt.
They can twist and squirm, but they owe ya.
- And if they don't wanna pay?
- Well, nobody wants to pay.
Here's what I think:
Worry is interest paid in advance on a debt that never comes due.
- Is it indeed?
- I warned ya.
Leave the job till tomorrow.
This evening, let's enjoy ourselves.
- You'll have to show me how.
- My pleasure.
Good evening, ladies.
Hello, girls.
Evidently intended for our betters.
I'm gonna go off and get into trouble.
How good of you to come out and join us.
Here we go.
You interested in tennis?
Never had too much time for it.
That's the whole problem with the whole thing, isn't it?
A man said: "It's all right when your hobbies get in the way of your work."
"But when they start to get in the way of each other..."
My little sister plays tennis.
Alternate on the Olympic team.
Well, sorry.
What I want to say is, thank you.
I was wrong today.
I was wrong to offer you money.
It was gauche... and it was-- and I appreciate your gesture.
I'm in your debt. Thank you.
Glad to help.
Lovely, romantic spot.
My name is Julian Dell, by the way.
Everybody calls me Jimmy.
- Joseph Ross.
- That was a nice gesture on your part.
- I appreciate it.
- Where's the young lady?
- The young lady on the beach.
- Helicopter.
Back to Bermuda.
You wanna get a drink?
Sure.
Who is she, the young lady on the beach?
Well, she's a princess.
You might say the title means nothing.
The country hardly exists anymore.
But perhaps it means something.
And the princess, she's what?
She's--
Well, she's married, and she's married to a friend of mine.
- So I saw you with the camera.
- Oh, yes.
What happened to the princess?
She was, of course, never here.
- We whisked her back to her husband.
- I understand.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
George Lang, Jimmy Dell.
- The fellow with the airplane.
- That's right.
- Pleasure. Nice plane.
- Beats walkin'.
A fellow said: "We must never forget that we are human."
"And as humans, we must dream..."
"and when we dream, we dream of money."
Well.
Money. Impresses everyone.
What did it ever do for one?
Useful if you want to buy things.
I got this.
- My sister.
- She young and pretty?
I think she'd qualify as young and pretty.
I'm gonna take a walk.
You wanna take a walk?
Bedtime for me.
Perhaps we'll meet back in New York.
I hope so.
- Got a card?
- Sure.
Lovely gesture of yours, giving me that camera.
Copies of the bills to the main office... and all incidental and personal items as we spoke of.
I know they're high on you. They even told me to pick up your local calls.
- I didn't call on anybody.
- Well, you missed your chance.
Should have gone hog wild on the company and stolen a bathrobe.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- For the purposes of billing... if you could render our account into American dollars.... and we would, of course, pay the exchange rate today.
The group has expressed an anxiety about the possibility of insider trading.
- I'm not about to indulge--
- Just mentioned it as a matter of--
- I understand.
- You understand what?
I understand that everyone is anxious.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
Okay, let me just take you through these charges.
- This is your room charge.
- Thank you.
- Right.
- Thank you. It's been our pleasure.
This is radioed telephone calls to the mainland.
And these were all room and beverage.
And this is for the steno translator.
- Is that right?
- This is for the international calls.
The international code.
Good, thank you.
We had the line open to
Switzerland every night.
That's fine.
Good morning.
How's the world traveler today?
Don't talk to me.
Feeling poorly?
I put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains.
How was your evening?
Actually, I had a rather interesting one.
Whoa, whoa.
What might this be?
Rich Aunt die?
Part of my adventure took place in the casino. Here's your half.
- My half?
- We swore to share and share alike.
- I don't need this.
- A deal's a deal.
- Give it to charity.
- Wait a second.
I‘ll get that.
Thank you.
You are a real gentleman.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry--
I'm so glad I caught you.
You're going back to New York.
- Might I ask you a service?
- Certainly.
Could you drop off a package for me?
Could you drop this off for my sister?
- Mrs. DeSilva at the Wiltshire?
- Sure.
- You don't mind?
- Glad to do it.
I'm going to be in New York
Friday. Are you free?
- I--
- We'll have dinner. Are you free?
- Of course.
- I'll call you.
- I look forward to it.
- Friday.
You may proceed to your gate.
Thank you.
May I help you, sir?
Is this the line to New York?
- Is there anything else, sir?
- Yeah.
- Anymore room in first class?
- I'll check.
- This is so generous of you.
- My pleasure.
- It's an extraordinary gesture.
- It's all right.
- Remarkable.
- Baby boomer, somebody said...
"Nobody going on a business trip would have been missed... if he didn't arrive."
This way, please.
- I'm sorry, miss.
- Camera.
Put it on the belt, please.
Next, step through.
See you on the plane.
- This film, is it gonna be--
- It won't hurt your film.
Just come through.
- Excuse me.
- This is so nice of you, really.
They told me I even get to keep my return ticket.
Use it any time.
Not that I plan to be back here, but--
- May I see your ticket?
- I know you wouldn't think it... but this gentleman arranged for me to sit here with quality.
Shows to go you.
You never know who anybody is.
Never know who anybody is.
That girl, said she was with the FBI.
- Guess what she does.
- What does she do?
She is with the FBI.
- Funny old world.
- Funny old word?
- Dog my cats.
- Dog my cats, indeed.
You never know who anybody is.
With the exception of me.
I am what I look like. Why is that?
- I think you look just fine.
- Anybody could be anybody.
Mysterious, or--
Take that guy who got off the seaplane.
- What about him?
- Who was he?
I don't know.
A fellow who got off a plane.
Just my point.
We think he's a fellow who got off a plane.
Can't go around mistrusting everybody.
You mistrust everybody?
- No, just strangers.
- Aha.
- We saw him get off the plane.
- We did not.
We saw him in a boat which came from the direction of the plane.
- I saw him get off the plane.
- Maybe that's what you think you saw.
I took a picture of you and he's in the background.
I believe you'll see--
I can't say that I'm sure-- but I think you'll see his boat just came from the direction of the plane.
We have no idea who anyone is.
We will be arriving in New York shortly.
You are required to fill out a passport form.
I think I'm getting the flu.
I'm taking in some Cuban cigars.
You? Did you?
Where'd you hide 'em?
Like they say at the airport:
"Did anyone give you a package?"
- "Did you leave your--"
- What do you mean?
Mules. People get people to bring in dope for them, or guns or something.
Somebody gives you a package to take back and you trust them.
Who in this world is what they seem?
Excuse me, sir.
We will be landing momentarily.
You must return to your seat!
One moment.
- Where are we?
- How do you feel?
My imagination, or was that new secretary with us up in first class?
- You bought her a ticket.
- I bought her the ticket?
You bought her the ticket.
You know what your problem is?
You're too nice.
Everything for everybody else, nothing for yourself.
- Driver, stop the car, please.
- Where are you going?
Will you take my stuff back to the office?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
This book could be rebound, but--
- Price is not an issue.
- Miss Smith.
Certainly, sir. But as I was going to say, it's a common book.
Common issue. I wouldn't be surprised if we--
By the way, if you are interested in Don Budge... it happens I have a very fine autograph of him at the French Open in, uh--
Got it, Mr. Cole.
Ah, you see?
- The very same.
- The same book?
Same book, same edition. identical.
May I wrap this for you?
Would you mind?
And if you are interested in the Don Budge photo...
I'm sure I could give you a very attractive price on it.
Yes, thank you.
- For Mrs. DeSilva.
- I'll see that she gets it, sir.
Thank you.
So, what are you doin' for the weekend?
- Far as I know, I'm workin' here.
- Workin', huh?
That's right.
See ya Monday.
The question is one of compensation... to which you are entitled.
Compensation as the discoverer... and as the head of the design team.
- It's your right.
- Every time I broach it--
- What does he say?
- "Wait until the stockholders' meeting."
Of course.
By then, it'll be too late.
Don't give up. We're gonna talk it out.
What are you doin' tonight?
- I think I'm going to dinner.
- Big date?
- Some people I met. Who is it?
- Susan Ricce.
Just a minute, please.
You givin' her a tumble?
Perhaps I have my sights set on different things.
Beware of all enterprises which require new clothes.
- Teatime.
- Shouldn't you be going home?
Well, yes, I have a hot date for the weekend... with this rich guy who's gonna whisk me to Connecticut... and loll me around in an old four-poster bed.
But it's just in my imagination, so here I am.
- Thank you.
- You studying tennis?
Oh, we didn't play in my neighborhood when I was a kid.
Getting used to the ways of the rich?
- Why should he be doing that?
- Oh, come on.
Would you turn away please?
How's everything in the outer offices?
My troika was pursued by wolves.
Good thing this cookie arrived unscathed.
It was a close thing.
Oh, no. I don't mean to pry.
I'm just here to serve.
Good night, Joe, Susan.
You get freed up, gimme a call.
I should stay home anyway.
I'm coming down with something.
- The flu.
- Lot of it going around.
Good night, George.
When you own the company, can I be Queen?
- What are you talking about?
- Little pitchers have big ears.
- Do they indeed?
- That's their identifying mark.
What do loose lips sink?
Ships.
See you on Monday, Susan.
Have a good weekend,
Mr. Ross.
When I get my film back from the Fotomat you'll see that... that guy was not on the seaplane and you'll owe me a dollar.
Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Klein.
- Nothing sensitive in there.
The process is in the safe on non-copyable paper.
There are, that I know of, only two keys.
I'm going home. You tell Susan that I'll see her on Monday.
- Anyone calls, I'll be home.
- Yes, sir.
- Could I say something?
- Please. What is it?
Sir, your concern with security indicates to me... that you think somebody's trying to take advantage of you.
I don't want to take advantage of you... and I don't want anyone to take advantage of me.
- I don't understand.
- I would like... consideration for the work
I've done on the process... and for the wealth that it's going bring.
I keep telling you, son, everybody appreciates the work you've done.
You'll find it recognized at the stockholders' meeting.
Good night.
Have a good weekend.
You've done a wonderful job, Joe.
Your work will be recognized.
- You wanna ride out with me?
- No, I have a dinner date.
- Car is here, sir.
- I take your point.
We'll just do our jobs... and we'll be rewarded according to our just desserts.
- I'm gone till Monday.
- Yes, sir. Have a good weekend.
- Aston Martin Lagonda Cabriolet.
- Where did the car come from?
This car came from the estate of the previous owner... and then was returned to Aston Martin.
Aston Martin and Lagonda merged in the mid-'40s.
- Compared to this Bentley--
- The Bentley isn't synchro-meshed.
You have independent rear suspension.
This car was considered the most decadent car of its day.
- Why is that?
- Look at the lines.
- And the speed?
- May I help you?
Sir, I'm sorry.
We're open only by appointment.
No, I--
I guess I'd, uh--
Well, I guess I'd better get out of your way.
Would you like us to drive it out to you this weekend on the island?
Someone should do a book:
Japanese all over the world... in front of the world's monuments, taking pictures of each other.
That's what somebody should do.
We were supposed to have dinner last night. What happened?
Don't the laws of courtesy apply to the rich?
You're a hell of a one to talk about courtesy.
I don't understand.
You had my sister waiting for you all afternoon.
- What?
- What do you mean, "What?"
I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.
- You were going to bring her the book.
- I did.
You left it for her.
You told me you were going to bring the book to her.
I called.
She was waiting for you.
- She was waiting?
- She waited all afternoon.
- I never said I'd bring her the book.
- I believe that's what we settled on.
It certainly was not.
I didn't-- Look.
Look, I didn't--
Look, I didn't want to intrude.
Why would I want to intrude?
My understanding was, you asked me to drop it off.
That's not what we said.
Look here.
It certainly is.
And I don't appreciate being accused of a lack of courtesy.
Seriously.
Isn't it possible you misremembered? No.
Don't look at me like
I want something from you.
I don't.
You asked me to do it.
Is it possible you got it wrong?
Huh? Is it possible?
It's possible.
All right. That's all
I wanted to say. Thank you.
I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I would drop by.
- You want some coffee?
- Sure.
So, as I said, I was just accidentally in the vicinity... and aren't you courteous and all for having me in?
Yes, well, good.
Make 'em right by my house.
Right under my house.
Small world, huh?
Chock full of coincidences.
Nice knife.
Thank you.
Got it in the Boy Scouts.
Hell of an organization.
Ever get the urge to do something adventurous... in spite of the ancient wisdom against interoffice romances?
Look, here's the thing.
I know you're in line for higher things.
You got it written all over you.
But you never get anything in life if you don't speak out for it...
So here's what I wanted to say.
I'm a hell of a person. I'm loyal, true and not too hard to look at.
What do you think?
- I think you're a lovely young woman.
- You think so?
- I've got eyes.
- You got very nice eyes.
Can you see without those things?
Sure.
Why don't you take 'em off?
This is Jimmy Dell.
I called to say I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- Yes. Do you know why?
Because I was wrong, and I'd like you to accept my apology.
- You're sorry.
- Yes, I was dead wrong.
I would be graceful if you would forgive me.
- Yes, I do. Thank you.
- Are you sure?
Good. Then if you're free tonight, my sister and I will take you to dinner.
I'll send my car for you.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Good.
- Your mother's sick or somethin', huh?
- No.
But, uh--
I'm busy.
You're busy.
Nothin' I can say to that.
But, uh...
It's lovely of you to stop by.
Well, I was in the neighborhood anyway.
If you ever feel the need of some company... or you'd like someone to cook you dinner-- or dinner and breakfast--
110 Mott Street.
110 Mott Street, above a bakery.
Above a bakery.
Above the Sunshine Bakery.
Wouldn't that be just like me?
Thanks.
The pool's too warm.
Hi. I'll throw on some clothes.
Do you want a drink?
Sure.
- Thank you.
- You swim every day?
I try to. My sister's gonna meet us at the club.
Sorry, I gotta catch it before they close.
I want to apologize.
- It's possible I misremembered.
- No.
That's not necessary.
It was me.
I'm sure it was my fault... and I'm gonna tell you why.
Want to hear a sad story?
Since we were kids, my sister and I... all we ever had was each other.
It's still all we have.
How's that for melodrama?
I called and told her
I wanted her to meet a nice guy.
You know what?
Forget about it.
Lord, didn't you get hot today?
- Got on my high horse.
- I suppose you did.
Got a little ahead of yourself... going on about
"You rich people."
- Did I say that?
- Yes, you did.
Before you throw your sister at me...
I think I should correct a misimpression.
Listening.
- I'm just a working man.
- Uh-huh.
What's a working man doing on
St. Estéphe? You a jewel thief?
- My company brought me down.
- Sell a million widgets or something?
Something like that.
Work for a living.
That's your dark secret.
- That's it.
- Well, that explains it.
- What?
- Your good manners.
Thank you. Noble savage.
Not even one Swiss bank account?
Wouldn't even know how to open one.
Did you have a dog when you were young?
- My mother had a dog.
- What was his name?
Paddy.
You now have a Swiss bank account, anybody asks.
Credit National de Geneve.
Code word: Paddy.
You just opened me a Swiss bank account?
Why?
Lavish, awkward gesture all of 15 Swiss francs in it.
But you ever want to impress anybody, they can find out you have an account... but Swiss law prohibits the bank from revealing the balance.
Thus are all men made equal.
Let me change. Let's go meet the little sister.
Good evening. You had a message from Mrs. DeSilva.
Thank you.
Well, she ain't feeling well.
Sends her regrets.
Can we meet her tomorrow for tennis?
You free?
- Of course. I hope it's not, uh--
- Would you call Mrs. DeSilva, James?
Tell her tennis tomorrow will be fine. 2:00?
- Hello, George. What's good tonight?
- It's all good.
- What'd you have?
- The venison.
- What'd the chef have?
- The venison.
Then we'll have the venison.
In for a treat.
What is it?
It's Saturday, Mr. Dell.
It's club members only tonight, sir.
Forget about it. Big deal.
- It's the board meeting after the meal.
- It's an old rule.
- The board members are here.
- Let's go somewhere else.
Who do you have to know in this town?
You sending me out for a burger?
- If there were anything I could do--
- No, Saturday night.
Members only.
Hell, get me a membership form.
- Go in the office and get a form.
- Please, James.
Listen, Jimmy, it couldn't be less important.
What could be better?
- You really don't have to do this.
- It's my nature.
I'm a problem solver and I have a heart of gold.
Thank you, James.
Speaking of gold, got more bullion on it than--
We're not electing him Pope or anything. Just sign it and we'll--
What is the phrase? Chow down.
Mr. Ross, welcome to the club.
- What do I owe you for the membership?
- Forget about it.
- Pay me when your ship comes in.
- That may be presently.
Glad to hear it.
Get a tip on a horse?
- The widgets.
- Widgets.
- We're developing a new--
- Put it in the bank.
- Do the American thing.
- What's that?
Marry a rich widow.
We used to say, a nymphomaniac who owns a liquor store.
That's right.
Money isn't everything.
- That's what my boss says.
- Does he?
That's right.
One thing my father taught me about business:
Always do business as if the person you're doing business with... is trying to screw you, because most likely they are.
And if they're not, you can be pleasantly surprised.
My father knew about business: work hard, take all the overtime you can get.
- You liked your father, huh?
- I loved my father.
- What did he do?
- Worked like a dog all his life.
Well, he left you a hell of a legacy.
I'm sure he'd be proud of you.
How can you say that?
People aren't that complicated.
Good people. Bad people.
They generally look like what they are.
Is that so?
It is.
Why are so many people having such difficulty?
That's the question that baffles me.
Play some tennis tomorrow?
Hi. There you are.
I'm sorry. I beg--
Transfer it from the A account.
Well, then take it--
That's right. Thank you.
What have you done with her?
Close out the account.
That's all right.
Just close it out and put it in the--
That's right. Put it in the
Channel Islands liquid. Thank you.
I don't care what the legal department said about verbal agreements.
You tell 'em I said to write it down-- who gets to do what to who.
- Thank you. Where's our girl?
- I thought you had her.
I ain't got her.
Let's go change.
About verbal agreements-- they're not worth the paper they're printed on.
- That's what my boss just said to me.
- In re what?
What was he talking about?
Well, I've got a--
- I got-- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I did something for the company and they owe me something.
- I think I need to get it in writing.
- I would. What do they owe you?
- I think they owe me a lot of money.
- What do you mean, you think?
I invented something for them.
It's a work for hire.
They own it, but--
Is Mrs. DeSilva in? Who told you it was a work for hire?
Well, they did. I--
- You invented it?
- Well, I--
I'm not a lawyer, I'm just a guy.
Tell me, you invented it?
But I'm sure it belongs to them.
I was in their employ at the time.
This is her brother.
Who am I speaking to?
Don't be so sure. You may very have a proprietary interest in this--
What is it?
She has the flu?
She has the flu.
- You have a contract with this company?
- I do.
Take it to a lawyer who specializes in contract law.
- I have a friend who's a lawyer.
- What's his name?
George Lang.
He works for the company.
Due respect to Mr. Lang, but if I may...
You want an independent view.
- I'll be glad to--
- No. I appreciate it though.
Please don't take it personally, but I, uh--
The phrase is, don't want to mix business and pleasure.
No, that's not it. I don't know that I want to adopt... an adversarial position toward the company.
- But you're in an adversarial position.
- No, I think you're wrong.
I think you'll find... that if what you've done for them is as valuable as you say it is... if they are indebted to you morally but not legally... my experience is, they will give you nothing... and they will begin to act cruelly toward you.
- Why?
- To suppress their guilt.
How's your sister?
All right. But if you need some help, just ask.
She's sick, by the way.
Down with the flu.
Lot of it goin' around.
Good morning, Mr. Ross.
A Mr. Julian Dell called for you.
Would you step over here for a moment, please?
- No message. He said he'd call back.
- Yeah.
Would you arrange to have some flowers sent for me, please?
- On company business?
- No, from me personally.
To Mrs. Emma DeSilva at the Wiltshire.
- Card: I am most sorry--
- Good morning, Mr. Ross.
- The card.
- I'll get back to that later.
I'd like to speak to you too.
I'll get back to that.
I got my photos back.
I have something to show you.
Just a sec, Susan.
We would suggest you simply think of it... as a revalidation of your agreement with the company.
I don't understand. Why would I have to revalidate my agreement?
This is purely a formality.
Before any announcements, you want to be certain that the process, Joe--
- Yes?
- That any uncertainty about--
- About any outstanding--
- There's several questions involved.
- Yes, what are they?
- Questions of security.
There's no question of security.
There's only one copy of the process.
- It's in my safe.
- Leakages of information.
- We have a proprietary process worth--
- That's a legitimate concern.
But I still don't see why that means
I should "revalidate" my agreement.
- Mr. Ross--
- I'll tell you what I will do.
I'll be glad to show this to my lawyer and then respond to you.
- Then I'll thank you for your time.
- Mr. Ross.
If I may. I don't see why you have to adopt an attitude.
- Thank you for your time.
- These are legitimate concerns.
- If I may, your attitude--
- My attitude?
Which attitude is that?
Did you question my attitude when I developed the process?
- Can we all calm down?
- No, wait a second.
We were calm.
Then all of a sudden you're in here with your lawyers.
- All I--
- All I am saying... is that I plan to take steps to ensure--
I ask you for assurances, and you want me to void my contract?
- No. I'm gonna make sure.
- What are you talking about?
I hope you're not talking about... any kind of actions that would injure the company.
What do you mean?
- Any premature, out-of-school dealings.
- How dare you.
- Because if we were to find any--
- How can you hire these people... and hide behind them?
How dare you, after all
I've done for this company?
He wants the expanded projections for the next two quarters.
- You got 'em handy?
- I sure do.
- Mr. Dell leave a number?
- Yes, sir.
Can you get him for me, please, Cathy?
It's ringing.
- Yeah. That you?
- Yes. Hi.
- What is if?
- I would very much like to meet... with the sort of person we talked about.
- Oh, yeah. Right.
- You were right.
- Tell me when and where.
- Tomorrow. Lunch, the Plaza.
Thank you.
The flowers, sir.
- What? Oh, uh--
- Cathy, could you get these out for me?
No, never mind.
Forget about it.
I knew you'd be back, sir.
For a tennis player, right?
Yes, she--
They play tennis, yes.
- You take a check?
- Certainly.
- Shall I wrap it?
- Yes, please.
Don Budge at the French Open.
Thank you very much.
It's a lovely gift, sir.
I'm sure whoever receives it... will cherish it for the rest of their days.
- May I help you?
- I'd like to leave a package.
- Certainly.
- For Mrs. DeSilva.
Oh! We have a package for Mrs. DeSilva.
I'm sorry.
A package for Mrs. Emma DeSilva.
Young Mrs. DeSilva.
The tennis player.
This is the only Mrs. DeSilva in the building.
This is Mrs. Emma DeSilva.
Well, you see here, Mr. Ross?
- I believe you owe me a dollar.
- What?
Here is my album of my one day in the sun. Some photos.
Here's my ticket good for one free return... any time to the Caribbean island of St. Estéphe.
And here, as you see, is our mystery man... his lovely companion and his boat... which as you see, has nothing whatever to do with the seaplane.
So, you never know who anybody is and it would pay to be a little careful.
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?
What's the matter?
I'm calling about that problem of yours which we discussed.
My lawyer wants you to bring your contract when you come.
- He's gonna get you straightened out.
- I appreciate it.
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Of course.
Here's what I think:
Whatever this thing is--
The thing?
The thing that you invented for the company.
- Yes.
- Bring a copy of it too.
Your sister gonna be there?
She's out for the count, but thank you for asking.
Federal Bureau of investigation.
May I direct your call?
- Special Agent Pat McCune, please.
- I'm sorry. Agent McCune is not in.
It's very important that I speak to her.
Could you tell me how to contact her?
One moment, please.
- McCune.
- Yes. I met you in the islands.
In the islands.
I'm calling about the man in the islands, the fellow with the seaplane.
- The fellow with the seaplane?
- That's right, yes.
- Is he the reason you were down there?
- The fellow calls himself Julian Dell?
Yes, that's right.
Give me your date of birth.
- What?
- You heard me.
December 10, 1960.
This fellow Dell, are you with him now?
All right.
I'm going to give you an address.
You meet me there.
Do you have a pencil?
Um, yes.
Come by yourself. Don't talk to this fellow between now and then.
- Cold, huh?
- What? Yeah.
Best thing to do for the cold: keep on moving.
Just keep walking, Mr. Ross.
Anybody following him?
My name is--
Yeah, I know who you are.
Ross, Joseph A.
D.O.B.: 12/10/60.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
- What was your mother's maiden name?
- Bainbridge.
Call up the car.
What was her mother's maiden name?
- Laval.
- Get in the car, would you, Mr. Ross?
If they start moving, give me a shout.
We'll catch you when we're rolling.
Gotcha.
A little walk in the park,
Mr. Ross.
And then to deliver the plans to him.
To deliver the plans.
The plans were for a project with--
Hey, don't tell me.
If it's secret, I don't want to know.
If our friend's after them,
I'm assuming they're valuable.
They're very valuable.
All right, how much have you told this guy?
- I haven't told him anything.
- How much have you told him?
- I haven't done anything illegal.
- You're in a lot of trouble.
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- Not from me, Mr. Ross. From him.
- From him?
- But you have an advantage.
If he doesn't know that you know.
What do you want to do?
- I want to help you catch him?
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Hurt your feelings, did he?
- That's right.
- We're rolling.
- Time to get to work. Where's the meet?
Plaza. Noon.
He's going to change it.
Don't worry.
- Let's go.
- How will I contact you?
No, we're gonna be watching you.
Keep your sense of humor.
Come on.
- Hello, Joe. Jimmy.
- Jimmy, how are you?
Did you go out last night?
I was calling you.
- Yeah, I went to a movie.
- What'd you see?
I--
Listen, Joe. Gotta change the meeting.
The lawyer can't do noon.
- Can't do noon?
- Make it at 10:00, can you?
- 10:00 a.m.?
- And listen.
Here's what he wants to do.
Meet us In the park.
- In the park?
- By the carousel.
- Why is that?
- For secrecy, to protect yourself.
The carousel at 10:00.
And bring the process.
Bring the process.
- Yeah?
- We have if.
You are to meet at the carousel at 10:00.
Do what he said.
Do everything he said.
But meet us first at 9:30 at the Navy Fountain... at 72nd Street, Central Park.
- Do you know it?
- Yes.
Navy Fountain, Central Park, 9:30.
Would you point to your right like you're directing me somewhere?
Just point to your right.
Thank you. Now, walk under the arches, please, and up the steps.
Get in the room.
Just get in the room.
It's an interesting setup,
Mr. Ross.
It is the oldest confidence game on the books.
The Spanish prisoner.
So how far back it goes-- glory days of Spain.
- We're clear outside.
- We're gonna have you wear a wire.
Fellow says him and his sister left a fortune in the home country.
He got out. The girl and the money got stuck in Spain.
I'm gonna put this transmitter on you, Mr. Ross.
Here is her most beautiful portrait.
He needs money to get her and the fortune out.
The man who supplies the money gets the fortune and the girl.
Oldest con in the world, intelligent people.
Play on their vanity and greed.
Interesting twist.
How are we doing for time?
- We have a couple of minutes.
- You sure you want to do this?
- Yes, I'm very sure.
- All right.
Plug him in.
You're wearing a radio transmitter.
Here is what we need.
He will ask you for the material.
We need you to refuse to give it to him.
- To refuse?
- You have to refuse. What's this?
It's the formula for a process.
This the real thing?
- Your man said to bring it.
- He told you to bring it?
He said to do whatever Del told me to do.
I was just following his orders.
Well, he's all set.
How're we doing?
The important thing is to refuse when Dell asks you for it.
Why?
Because he will then either bribe or threaten you.
That's what we want on tape, and that's what he will have to answer for.
You've been after him a long time.
That's why you were down in the islands.
This is a very bad actor,
Mr. Ross.
We've been after him some time.
We're very grateful for your help.
- Can we have the reading, please?
- Will you speak, please?
Just speak normally.
- It's time.
- We'll have you in sight all the time.
- Can we put a vest on him?
- We're out of time.
There is very little likelihood of physical danger.
Should it start to break out, if there is shooting, do not move.
- What did I just tell you?
- Do not move.
- It's time to go.
- We appreciate your help.
The transmitter's good for three hours.
You wait until he offers you money... or he threatens you, and then hand him the material.
Give him a word.
You get in trouble, just say the word "happiness."
- Say it.
- Happiness.
That looks good.
You have reached a nonworking number.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
This call is being recorded.
Please patch me through to Special Agent Pat McCune.
One moment.
Yeah, I'd like to speak to Special Agent Pat McCune.
This is Pat McCune.
Hello?
Can I help you?
And these were his living quarters?
Absolutely clean.
Not a print anywhere.
It's a coat check room, Mr. Ross.
It's not the office of anything.
It's a restaurant.
Always has been.
Never been a club.
That's what I'm talking about.
What goes around comes around.
The photos of our trip.
And this fellow getting off the seaplane?
And this fellow getting off the seaplane?
- Well, we joked about that.
- What do you mean?
I said he was never on the seaplane.
That this fellow Mr. Dell was never on the seaplane?
- That's what we joked about.
- You joked about it?
- Yes.
- And was he on the seaplane?
Well, I don't know if he was on the seaplane or not.
I just used it as an excuse to make conversation.
- To make conversation with Mr. Ross?
- That's right.
Why? Are you having an affair with Mr. Ross?
What? What's--
Now, do we have any photographs in which we see this other man's face?
What's the matter?
Has something happened to Mr. Ross?
Not that I know of.
But I will have to ask you a few more questions about your trip.
- The company paid for the trip?
- That's right.
And you've been working for the company how long?
A few months.
But is Mr. Ross all right?
As far as I know, he's fine.
But I don't understand.
The lieutenant--
- This man didn't offer you anything.
- I told you--
You purchased a first-class ticket for Susan Ricci, an office employee.
Paid cash, a total of--
- The money was from Mr. Lang.
- George Lang, your colleague?
- He won at the casino and told me to--
- Give it to a charitable cause?
- That's right.
- And you thought that meant a ticket?
Well, perhaps I was--
- You were what?
- Showing off.
Showing off for the girl? Why?
I don't know. What does it matter?
It wasn't my money. Ask George.
- Well, he's sick, right?
- That's right.
Well, we'll have him in as soon as--
- Bought some clothes down there?
- That's right.
In the town of St. Estéphe.
Paid cash again.
Yes, I went to the hotel office and changed some traveler's checks. and, yes, I went into town and paid cash in a clothing store.
So Mr. Lang didn't give you that money too?
Why did you change the checks at the hotel office?
Why not just use them at the clothing store? Why not?
- I don't know.
- You don't know why you did that?
Spent a lot of money on clothes.
- I wanted to indulge myself.
- Indulge yourself?
I did it reluctantly.
You can ask Mr. Lang.
He's your attorney?
He's an attorney for the company.
He's my friend.
- Why isn't he here?
- Well, he's ill.
- He's gonna clear you of everything?
- I've done nothing wrong.
- He has special knowledge of this case?
- Yes, he does. And when you see him--
You know, Mr. Ross, you're in a lot of trouble.
- I came to you!
- And we're the least of it.
I promise you, you can turn back the clock right now.
Give your employer back what you took, if you have it, and I'll deal with you.
- But if we turn this over--
- What do you mean?
The feds won't deal with you, you know?
They'll put you inside for all days.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about unreported income.
- I don't understand.
- I'm saying, when the IRS--
I have nothing to hide from the IRS.
- You purchased a first-class ticket--
- I explained that. The ticket was--
- You got any undisclosed bank accounts?
- What?
No gold, no foreign money?
I'm just a salaried employee.
No Swiss bank accounts?
No, I told you--
You've got at the Credit National de Geneve... a numbered account opened last week.
There's nothing in that account.
- Then what's it doing there?
- It's just a joke.
Goddamn it, man.
Won't you come clean?
Don't you know you're beat?
It's over. It's all done.
I told you, look.
Believe me, look.
The man is--
He's obviously--
You must have a file on him.
- Who?
- Jimmy Dell.
You must have a record of him.
He's a career criminal.
A record?
Where would we find such a record?
You want to give us a photograph, fingerprints?
- His fingerprints?
- Something with his fingerprints.
Anything he touched. Anything?
Is that your signature? yes.
Planning a trip to Venezuela?
Why would I go to Venezuela?
They have no extradition treaty with the United States.
I'm not going to Venezuela.
This is a request for political asylum from the Republic of Venezuela.
You just told me you signed it.
Now, Mr. Ross, if I told you this story... would you believe it?
I want a lawyer.
I would say so.
If the process is gone, if we've lost it... why, then, my family and I--
This is my retirement, Joe.
This is what I've worked for.
I have nothing in the bank.
If this goes--
Well, look...
I brought this on myself, and I apologize.
If my actions drove you to this--
Mr. Klein, this is not the time, and it's really not required of you--
Be quiet.
I'm going to finish this.
I'm asking you--
No, I'm pleading with you--
However you want to put it and whatever trouble you're in...
I swear I will help you.
I've paid your bail.
I won't press charges.
I've asked that my charges be dropped.
But please bring it back to me.
Don't let it go to the Japanese.
Bring it back.
Thank you.
You'll be back.
- Hey, George.
- Yeah, Joe.
- I need to talk.
- I'm not well.
George, I need to talk to you.
I know you're sick, but--
Yeah. The problem?
I need your help and your advice.
So come over. yeah.
Get up.
I'm in the living room.
Then I thought that perhaps
I had done it.
But you haven't done it.
What are you talking about?
My greed.
You've done nothing.
Someone has singled you out... to take advantage of you.
No, it has something to do with--
Who are you calling?
I'm calling in sick.
Please enter your security ID number... and the extension of the person you wish to speak with... or leave a message after the tone.
This is Susan Ricci.
I've got the flu, I won't be in today.
Well, you're always getting it wrong.
That's why they picked you, isn't it?
You're the innocent, you're the victim.
I'm the Boy Scout.
Call it whatever you want, but we're gonna get out of it.
Now listen.
Here's what we're going to do.
What?
That's just Mrs. Ramon.
All right, now listen.
There's gotta be some record of this
Mr. Dell, some record of his face.
There's gotta be something he left his fingerprints on.
- When we find that, the police--
- Security camera.
The hotel had a security camera.
They save the tapes for insurance.
His face is on the videotape.
I have very little money.
Why don't you take this?
I don't have a passport.
Don't need a passport for St. Estéphe.
You got a driver's license?
I left my bloody fingerprints all over the apartment.
Well, that's what happened then, isn't it?
And I'm the only one with a motive.
Well, let's clear it up then.
Hey, what do you think?
Don't you doubt me for an instant?
- I don't doubt you, no.
- Why?
Because I'm stuck on you.
I believe we have a problem.
Good morning, ma'am, sir.
Scream at me.
Well, this is the end, you stupid Mick!
Do you think wanted to go to your drunken family?
You call it a holiday?
It's a disgrace!
It's 8:00 in the morning, you are drunk and you forgot the tickets!
- And you expect me to drive home--
- Could you please pull your car over?
I am not pulling the car over.
I am not going to Toronto... and I am not going anywhere but dump this disgrace at home!
Do you think it's all Irish and charming to behave this way?
You disgust me!
All right, keep moving out of the terminal.
You bet I'm gonna keep moving out of the terminal! Don't smile at me!
Let's go. Come on.
What is it?
They played me for such a fool.
Such a fool.
You know, you just had some bad training early on.
What do you mean?
Somebody screws around with you, you don't get morose.
You go out and get even with 'em.
Look, there's bad people in the world.
You just ran into some of them.
How do I get to St. Estéphe now?
The traditional way, you fly.
They're looking for me at the airports.
Not gonna be looking for you in Boston.
- How do you know?
- St. Paddy's Day in Boston.
Aren't gonna be looking too hard for much of anything.
- I don't have a ticket.
- Then it's a good thing I do.
You just take everything in stride.
Next time be born Italian.
- That's the thing to do.
- You thought of everything.
Ain't hard to do.
I'm fond of you.
What?
Crikey!
The ticket.
When in Rome--
Oh, yes, Erin go brag.
Thanks.
Come on, Joe.
PAC Air announces the departure of flight 12 to St. Estéphe.
- Get the tape. Come back safe.
- All passengers...
- Let's clear this thing up.
- Please proceed to Gate 5.
Listen--
I know you're innocent.
Now you go prove it and come back to me.
- What will you do?
- I'll worry about you.
Come on.
If you have your tickets, you may proceed directly through security.
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes, sir?
- Give it back!
- Thanks.
You can have your book after you finish your brownie.
And I don't want your fingerprints all over it. That's enough.
- We'll be here for an hour.
- They won't be looking for you here.
Take the camera. Get a picture of the girl who played the princess.
- Can that help?
- It can't hurt.
If you can think of any other thing, something he touched--
- Do you have your ticket?
- Thank you.
Yeah, sure.
- You see in the paper this morning?
- That's why I won't go to New York.
You know, in the older days you didn't have to worry--
It is becoming more dangerous.
The statistics--
I told you, you cannot have the book until you're finished with your brownie.
I want it!
- My book!
- Thank you.
Oh, now, fine. You've torn it.
You've torn your book!
You can move to the head of the line, if you'd like.
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you. Excuse me. Sorry.
Now that's it. You've torn your book, and I'm not getting you another one.
That's the last and final word about that.
- Right this way.
- Excuse me.
You've torn your book, and I am not going to get you another one.
We'll take the stroller, ma'am.
We need to put Teddy through the machine. Thanks.
Thank you.
I really need you to do what we tell you to do.
You've got to start listening to me.
Sir, we need you to put your camera through.
Please proceed to the international departure area beyond security gates.
- Everything's fine.
- My teddy bear!
- It's gonna be through any second.
- Now, look!
- It's gonna be just fine.
- You got your fingerprints on the book.
You've torn it, and you've got your fingerprints all over it!
Book. He left his fingerprints on it.
He left his fingerprints on the tennis book.
See, when I press the button, the bear will come right through.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Nothing in the world.
Here comes the bear now.
What did I tell you?
Book. Tennis book.
He left his fingerprints on it.
What happened back there?
- There's prints on it.
- What?
Dell must have left his prints on the torn tennis book.
Well...
We'll have to get back to New York and get it.
Well, indeed, we will.
What happened back there?
How did they get on to you back there?
The alarms at the airport.
- I don't know.
- No matter at all.
The important thing is to get you out of here.
Where are we going?
We'll get into Boston.
We'll figure it out.
I'm gonna tell you what. No matter.
We'll get to New York and get the book.
- What?
- We're gonna call up.
We'll get someone to take it to the cops. Who can we call?
I'm gonna call Klein.
Right back.
- Traveling?
- Yes.
Ticket, please.
Sir, I'm afraid this boat doesn't go that far.
What?
You got a ticket here for Venezuela.
Why would you want to go there?
Why would you want to go there?
Because they have no extradition treaty.
Good.
- I got Mr. Klein on the phone.
- Let's go. Come on.
- You okay?
- I'm fine. You?
- Yeah, you found him?
- What?
- Mr. Klein.
- Yes, found him.
Good.
He left his fingerprints on the book.
So he wasn't that smart, was he?
Say that again.
Why would someone do that?
Why would somebody go into a life of crime?
I don't know.
I think there are people we can't understand.
To steal what others worked for?
To kill?
We can't know, Joe.
Golly, Joe, I--
Oh.
Why?
Why? For the money.
What was the idea?
I was to be shot at the airport?
Can I ask what you plan to do with me?
I don't know.
Something probably understanding, though, knowing you.
I suppose you think that makes me weak?
I'm just so sorry
I can't be that generous.
And we come to the end of a perfect day.
Clang, clang, end of the line.
- What's he been telling you?
- Sweet nothings.
- Well, shall we wrap it up?
- So, how does it end?
Well, it appears you stole, you killed, you kidnapped her.
You did it all for the money, and now, overcome with remorse... you took your own life.
- What could be more appropriate?
- And if I don't cooperate?
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Why?
Because money makes the mare go.
Nobody lives forever.
The important thing is to enjoy yourself.
Kill him.
When we have finished--
Please.
Didn't your mother have a dog named Paddy?
- What?
- Didn't she have a dog named Paddy?
This must be a big day for you.
See if you can get him to tell you where the process is.
We need to know where the process is.
But you're doing fine.
Afraid we don't have too much time.
What'd you do with the process?
That's your last request?
Yes. Could you grant me that?
We took the report... and we sold it to Switzerland.
We put it on a CD-ROM.
I get a hundred million in my bank account as soon as you're dead.
You don't have to do this.
I enjoy doing it, actually.
But thank you for your concern.
Good-bye.
And now I suppose you'll take the process to Japan?
United States Marshal Service, actually.
- Did you have to kill him?
- Didn't kill him.
Stun gun.
Fast-acting tranquilizer.
- Good shooting.
- Stun gun? What if you missed?
Well, then it'd be back to the range for me.
The whole thing was set up by your boss,
Mr. Klein, to steal the process.
He used you to steal it and to get away with the crime.
There's only two keys to the safe, and he didn't want to take it.
Then you had to.
You've been watching the whole time?
Your tax dollars at work.
I want to see everyone back at the office.
- Nobody looks at a Japanese tourist.
- Yo, boss.
Can you help me?
You're the Boy Scout.
Can I be your good deed for today?
Can't you help me, Joe?
I'm afraid you're gonna have to spend some time in your room...
Come on, Doc.
Reporting live from the home...
...of Dr. Richard Kimble...
...a respected vascular surgeon at
Chicago Memorial Hospital.
Details are sketchy...
...but we understand Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered this evening.
Area Six detectives are bringing
Dr. Kimble out.
We assume that they're gonna be taking him to a police station, probably Area Six...
...where they hope he can shed some light on what happened here this evening.
Now, as I indicated, she was found shortly before midnight.
We know that she made apparently a 911 call to police...
...indicating that she was being assaulted by an intruder.
Details are very sketchy.
We do know that he and his wife Helen...
...were at the Four Seasons
Hotel earlier tonight...
...a fundraiser for the
Children's Research Fund.
Rich, remember Cara?
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Straighten that arm or you're gonna slice.
Golf pro teach you that?
My wife.
Before I forget...
...thanks for the loaner.
Keys are downstairs.
- Any gas in it?
- Yes. Enough.
Alec, Richard Kimble.
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble!
Knock it off!
There's nothing to see here.
And you, come with me.
Thank you.
I was just down to my last joke.
You look really beautiful tonight.
Thanks, honey.
I know you hate these things, but God,
I love looking at you in a tux.
I feel I look like a waiter or something.
- Dr. Kimble?
- Yes, it is.
Sorry to bother you, sir...
...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency
Surgery and needs your help.
Call him back and tell him
I'll be right there.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you. Good night.
I'll wait up for you.
I'll wait up for you.
Talk to me. What have we here?
Thanks for coming.
A 58-year-old.
Just pulled his gallbladder. Bleeding.
Big time. It's in the liver bed.
- What are his coags?
- They're all messed up.
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.
Where is he from?
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.
Here guys. Let me in there.
Give me some room.
Give me a clamp.
Give me suction.
Have you been getting any threats at work?
Co-workers, hospital staff, anyone?
Anything unusual going on...
...phone calls, people hanging up?
Maybe people coming to the door?
Tradespeople?
Not that I know of.
Back to this fight with this guy with one arm.
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?
Upstairs.
And he had which? A right or a left arm?
With a gimmick on it?
Right arm.
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...
No, he had a cosmetic hand.
The security system in your house, it's a pretty good one.
Anyone else have the coding?
Our maid.
She knows the code and has a key.
Those scratches on your neck...
...did the one-armed guy do that?
Helen scratched me when I was trying to move her.
Before or after you had the fight with the one-armed man?
I told you.
You own a gun, Doc?
Do you own a gun?
Yes, we have a gun in the house.
Is it registered in your name?
Yes.
Where do you usually keep that gun?
The one that you own.
It's in Helen's table.
Bedside table.
Do you keep much jewelry in the house?
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...
...the gun and the bullets...
...and the good doctor's skin is under her fingernails.
She's got the money in the family, hasn't she?
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.
Is she insured?
Yes, she is.
Who's the beneficiary?
I am.
The sole beneficiary?
Yes.
Financially, you won't be hurting after this, will you?
I mean, she was worth quite a bit of money.
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?
You're saying that I crushed her skull and shot her.
How dare you!
When I came home, there was a man in my house.
I fought with this man.
- The one-armed man.
- He had a mechanical arm.
- Plastic? Rubber?
- You find this man!
You find this man!
How tall?
He took everything from me.
Oh, Jesus.
What did he weigh?
What color was his hair?
What color were his eyes?
We can't help you if you don't help us.
Book him.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...you will hear iron-clad proof of Richard Kimble's guilt.
Indisputable scientific evidence...
...that on the night of January 20...
...Richard Kimble did in fact viciously...
...attack...
...and brutally murder his wife.
But you'll hear more than that.
You will hear a voice from the grave.
The voice of Helen Kimble identifying her killer...
...her husband, Richard Kimble.
Detective Kelly...
...tell us what you observed at the home of the victim on the night of the murder.
No forcible entry was found.
From the beginning of the investigation, it didn't appear to be a break-in.
Nothing was missing.
Honey, I'm home.
Who won the game?
His prints were on the gun and bullets.
No other sets were found, other than the housekeeper's...
...and the deceased's.
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused a massive hemorrhage to the brain.
It took less than 5 minutes for her to die.
Your Honor, we would ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...
...previously identified by a Chicago
Police Department dispatcher.
Emergency 911.
Please help me.
What's the problem?
He's...
He's still in the house.
Did I hear you right?
Someone's in your house?
He's trying to kill me.
Could you repeat that, please?
Ma'am?
He's trying to kill me.
Is your attacker still in the house?
Richard...
Richard...
Is he trying to kill me?
Mr. Kimble...
...having considered all the factors and aggravation and mitigation in this case...
...and found the offense was brutal and indicative of wanton cruelty...
...it's judgment of this court, you will be remanded to Illinois State Penitentiary...
...where you will await execution by lethal injection...
...on a date to be set forth by the Attorney General of the State.
May God have mercy on your soul.
- Carlson.
- Here.
- Partida.
- Yeah.
- Copeland.
- What?
Copeland, you be nice now.
Kimble.
Yeah.
Let's go, gentlemen.
Four prisoners coming out.
Let's go, gentlemen.
Kimble, you're here.
Carlson, right over there.
Partida, up front left.
Copeland, you're back here with me.
Come on, make yourselves comfortable.
You know the routine, gentlemen.
I'm tired.
20 miles from Menard.
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.
I'll be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie take care of them.
Always got some good eating there.
I'm starving.
Me, too.
Had enough prison chow.
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.
Right, Ed?
Somebody get in here, quick!
He's getting sick! Let's go move! Move!
- He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.
He's choking!
Wait!
Oh, shit!
Kimble, get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!
Unlock me!
You'll be okay.
What the hell is that?
Shit!
Help me!
The hell with you.
Help me with this man!
Kiss my ass, Doctor.
Now you listen.
I don't give a damn which way you go.
Just don't follow me. You got that?
Be good.
My, my, my.
What a mess.
It's a circus.
You got my bag?
Point of impact right here.
The first engine uncoupled, and the train jumped the track.
About 100 yards?
You must get new boots.
I told you not to wear the heels.
Wear two coats.
Next train wreck.
Why do we always mother her?
Because she loves us.
- How'd you like to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.
Hold it, sir.
Hi. Who's in charge?
Sheriff Rollins.
Just follow the TV lights.
Sheriff Rogers.
Rollins!
Look down there and take Newman.
Come on. Time to go to work.
The bus rolled over several times before settling down at the bottom of the hill.
I don't know if I passed out or what...
...but when I looked up, the train was bearing down on us. Fast.
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.
Somehow I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus.
- You're brave, you could've been killed.
- I know.
He's my partner.
He would have done the same for me.
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S.
Marshal Samuel Gerard, I'd like to...
I'll be with you in just a minute.
One more time, just for the record...
...these three are dead.
And this one?
Everything happened so fast.
I don't think he made it.
You came a long way for nothing.
With all due respect, Sheriff Rollins...
...I'd like to recommend checkpoints on a 15-mile radius...
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route 13...
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic and they'll flood my office with calls.
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...
...so I'll take over your investigation.
On what authority?
The governor...
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...
...5th District, Northern Illinois.
All right, you want jurisdiction over this mess. You got it.
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp is here to mop up...
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.
Sam.
Look here!
We're always fascinated when we find leg irons with no legs in them.
Who held the key, sir?
Me.
Where're those keys at?
I don't know.
Care to revise your statement, sir?
What?
Do you want to change your bullshit story, sir?
- He might've got out.
- He might've got out.
You said he was part of the wreckage!
Set up operations by the fire truck.
Listen, everyone!
A fugitive has been on the run for 90 minutes.
Average foot speed over uneven ground, barring injury, is four miles an hour.
That gives us a radius of six miles.
What I want out of each and everyone of you is a hard target search of every...
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse, hen house, outhouse...
...and doghouse in that area.
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.
Go get him.
Please don't give me shit.
I got three very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.
Stevens, it's Cosmo.
I'll have a satellite telephone hookup in two seconds.
Chester Police just found a blood trail...
...two miles southwest.
Match that blood against the prisoners'.
Get a fax I.D. on Kimble to every local hospital.
And follow that with troopers.
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.
Think me up some coffee and a doughnut with sprinkles on top...
...while you're thinking.
We got a live body!
A live one?
Come on. Hang in there, brother.
We'll get you out of here.
Get that ambulance down here! Come on!
Is this what you want?
That's it.
I'm going to make some copies.
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.
We're thirsty today, aren't we?
Eat up before this gets cold.
It really does get dry in here, doesn't it?
Here you are.
Now, you eat something, Mr. Johnson.
You need your strength.
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner from that wreck. He might be hurt.
What does he look like?
Six-one, 180, brown hair, brown eyes, beard.
Seen anyone like that around?
Every time I look in the mirror, pal.
Except for the beard, of course.
Doc!
Thanks.
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, Doc.
It's...
How is he doing?
Good, considering we dug him out from under a train.
Tell those attending he's got a puncture in the upper gastric area.
How could he tell that by looking at his face?
Background just came in from Chicago.
About time. What've we got?
"Richard Davis Kimble, vascular surgeon. "
What the hell is that?
Somebody that makes more money than you.
"Convicted of first-degree murder of his wife.
"Pleaded innocent. "
Says a one-armed man did it.
Lots of friends.
Doctors, hospital staff.
We'll start there. I want phone taps.
First, his lawyer.
You'll never going to get that.
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want phone taps.
Why'd you yell at me?
I'll tell him who if I'm in a good mood.
Why not yell at her sometimes?
We got a call from the hospital.
The wounded guard swears he saw Kimble there.
That's hot.
And an ambulance is missing.
Where the hell is he going in an ambulance?
Ambulance just spotted...
...two miles west of Doverville, heading north, State Highway 53.
Running out of map!
Get your maps out.
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.
I want to know all routes in and out of that town.
We're headed north on Route 13, toward the Barkley Dam.
Son of a bitch!
Don't lose that ambulance.
Visual location of an ambulance headed north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.
We'll pass through a viaduct.
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and Newman in from the south side of the viaduct.
He's hauling ass.
Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?
Look on your map to know how to get there.
We got him!
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!
- What's going on?
- Get back in your car, sir!
Newman! Rock and roll!
Put a light in there!
Put a light in there!
What do you got?
I got nothing.
- What do you got?
- You gotta be kidding me!
You gotta be kidding me!
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!
We got a gopher.
Shit! I just bought these shoes.
Shut up, Cosmo.
Which way, Sam?
I didn't kill my wife!
I don't care!
Put that gun down!
Put that gun down!
Now!
Hands up!
Over your head!
Turn around!
Richard, do you want to get shot?
Pay attention!
Get down on your knees!
Right now!
What happened? Where'd he go?
He did a Peter Pan right here off this dam!
Right here!
Down! Boom!
Holy shit!
Can we go home now?
No.
Holy shit!
- There's no way out of here!
- We must go up.
Go up the stairs! Up, up!
Have that water turned off.
Come over here.
Put two patrol cars on that bridge down there, four patrolmen.
Have them glass this river upstream and down.
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river.
Make him aware of these wires.
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!
That'll make him easy to catch.
I want hounds on both banks of this river for two miles...
...upstream and downstream.
You've got a search-and-rescue team?
Get them down here and drag the bottom of this spillway.
- Why isn't the water turned off?
- Somebody from County's working on it.
Bring in the helicopters now.
We're out of here!
I don't think there's anything to find.
Find it anyway. You've got lights and generators coming tonight.
- I won't tell you how to do your job...
- Put the helicopter on the bridge!
...but only one person in a million could survive that fall. The guy is fish food!
Get a cane pole.
Go catch the fish that ate him.
Get Stevens. Tell him we're on the way in.
That man took everything from me!
We can't find the guy.
We can't find the guy.
You find that man!
You find that man!
You find that man!
The generators and searchlights are there now.
They'll continue the search into the night.
Good. Call Kentucky and thank them for the dogs.
Remember, opera ain't over until the Big Dog howls.
Need a ride?
Check it again.
All right, we got him. He shacked up with some babe over in Whiting.
She left work tonight and took him home.
- About two hours ago, her boss said.
- They spotted her car outside her house.
Does she run with anyone?
No one we could find. No family either.
Tell the police not to move till we get there. We'll go first thing in the morning.
Your cousin still got his truck?
Call him. Tell him we need it.
Be drunk, Newman.
Stay close.
Right on your ass, buddy.
I don't want you getting lost.
You stick with me.
U.S. marshals! Everybody down!
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!
Keep them up!
Get your ass in there.
I got your man! I got your man, you hear me?
I want out of here!
I got your man!
I got your man!
I'm going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!
Do you hear me, Cops?
Do you hear me?
I want out of here!
- Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.
Shut up! Shut up!
Do you hear me?
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.
I just want a car out front.
Don't shoot.
It's over.
Shut up!
I can't hear anything. My ear is...
I can't believe you did that.
You think I should've bargained with that guy.
Yeah.
I do.
You could have missed.
You could have killed me.
How bad is that ear?
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.
Let me see it.
Come here.
Can you hear what I'm saying now?
Yeah.
I don't...
...bargain.
You hear that?
Yeah.
Good.
Walter, this is Richard.
Richard, Jesus! Why did you run?
Running only makes you look guilty.
I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.
Tell me where you are, so I can meet you and you can surrender.
I won't surrender. I need help, money.
You're asking me to harbor and aid a convicted felon. I can't help you that way.
My advice both as your friend and legal counselor is to give yourself up.
Now tell me, where are you?
St. Louis.
Give me an address.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.
Well, sir, you can blame me.
I'm the one that shot him.
Give yourself up.
Now tell me, where are you?
St. Louis.
So he's not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.
Yeah, you been right before.
Walter, this is Richard.
Why did you run?
It only makes you look guilty.
I wasn't worried about appearances.
Tell me where you are, so I can meet you and you can surrender.
I won't surrender. I need help, money.
I might be crazy, but that train sounds like an EI.
St. Louis doesn't have one.
How do you know it's an elevated train?
I lived under an El for 20 years.
Explain the difference between the sound of an El and a train on the ground.
You must have ears like an eagle.
Play that back.
I want to hear the sound of an EI.
What cities have Els?
New York has got an EI.
- Philly.
- We do.
Milwaukee has got an EI.
Hold it! Where the lawyer says he's guilty.
There's a bell in the background.
There's a guy on a P.A.
Can you drop everything but him?
I'll try. Hold on.
Right there.
What's he saying?
Sounds like, "Next stop. " Do that again!
"Next stop... "
"Merchandise Mart. "
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge, six blocks away.
I knew it was an EI.
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.
- I'll call the C.P.D.
- This is his Chicago file.
Andiamo, bambini.
Sammy, when I die,
I want to come back just like you.
Happy and handsome?
- I'll notify the press.
- No press.
Right, no press.
- Hi, Billy.
- How's it going, sir?
- Good, and you?
- All right.
- Here you go, Billy.
- Have a good one, sir.
Spare change? Dollar, mister?
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.
Oh, my God. Richard!
How are you, Charlie?
Jesus, you're back.
I need some money.
Sure, sure. Get in.
No, I can't. Just whatever you got on you.
You're hot, pal. If not now, you will be.
Have you got a place to stay?
I mean, how can I help you?
You've got a green light. Move on!
I'll call you.
So why did Richard Kimble kill his wife?
He did it for the money.
For the money? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.
She was more rich.
Is this the entire Chicago Police
Department file?
- That's everything.
- I want to do all the interviews again.
The list of hospital staff is it in the file?
Sure is.
Thank you.
You don't want to use the media?
We want him to relax. Make himself comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.
Here's the apartment.
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.
Here is kitchen. Sink.
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.
Is nice bed.
Plenty space.
You can look at.
So you like the place?
It's okay with you?
It's perfect.
All right, people.
As this morning we were notified by the U.S. Marshal's Office...
...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble is alive and well and back here in Chicago.
You all know in what high regard we hold this scumbag.
So I'm personally donating a bottle of 12-year-old Scotch...
...to whoever puts the collar on this quack.
Dick Rosetti is passing out bulletins.
- Help you?
- Gracias.
You went to medical school together?
Yes, we did.
The class of '73.
You know Morton Feinberg?
- I do.
- He's a real nice guy.
When did you see him last?
Who, Richard?
I saw Richard this morning.
You saw him this morning?
He stopped me in my car.
I gave him money.
Where was this?
Outside my tennis club.
Did he ask for help?
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.
How much did you give him?
Couple of bucks. Just what I had on me.
- He won't get far on that.
- Why'd he come back to Chicago?
He didn't tell me that, sir.
I'm sure he's trying to protect you from having to lie for him, but...
You really want to be his friend and help him?
Help us bring him in unharmed.
Why?
So he can go back to prison?
If you want help, gentlemen, you've come to the wrong man.
Richard is innocent.
You'll never find him. He's too smart.
We're some smart guys.
What about us? We're smart. We are.
How smart could he be, really?
Is he as smart as you are?
Smarter.
Peripheral vascular surgery. Fixing the arteries as they come out of the heart.
- How long have you known Kimble?
- Ten years. Since I've been here.
What kind of medicine did he practice here at the hospital?
I want you to know that
I believe Kimble to be innocent.
Would he come to you for help?
If he came to me, I would help.
But he wouldn't come to me.
That's not his style.
A warrant remains outstanding for
Chicago surgeon, Richard Kimble.
This is where the one-armed guy he struggled fell down the stairs.
If I fell down these stairs,
I'd be a goner. I'd be dead.
What a waste!
When I came home, there was a man in my house.
Richard.
You like stringing out
12-year-old girls, huh?
What are you doing with my baby?
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.
Come on, ma'am.
What they doing to my baby?
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?
A lot of kids.
They bring them all here?
All coming down here to County.
I've come to do those blinds.
I'll get the door.
I'll start in here, huh?
Let's go over it once more.
What time did he arrive at the house?
About 10:30 in the morning.
- And he was alone?
- Yeah, he was alone.
- You got a good look at him?
- Yeah, a real good look.
You better be straight with me.
This is the guy staying in your mother's basement?
That's what I'm telling you.
I need a doctor over here!
Watch the bag! Watch the bag!
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.
My chest hurts.
Check the film on that kid.
Take a deep breath.
Inhale, exhale. Again.
Slowly.
Check the film.
Take it easy.
What's the status on that kid?
Possible fractured sternum.
Get over here. I need you.
Can you help us?
Bring this kid to Observation Room Two.
Yeah, you. Come on, help us out, okay?
How are you, champ?
My chest hurts.
Does it hurt when you breathe?
Yes.
- What's your name?
- Joel.
Look at this.
We're eating oranges and we're making IDs.
"C.C.H. " What the hell is that?
Cook County Hospital.
Just hang on, okay?
You'll be okay, pal.
You'll be just fine.
Hold that elevator.
Thank you.
How're you doing?
My chest hurts.
Where's your mom, pal?
I don't know.
Is she at home?
I think she's with my brother.
Your brother? They're downstairs?
I don't know.
Don't worry.
We'll find her for you.
What are you?
Football player? Baseball player?
Football.
Hold on, son.
Hey, Doctor.
They sent this one from downstairs.
Get this one into Room Four, stat.
Bye-bye, Joel.
Where's that boy I sent here?
- What boy?
- The one with the fractured sternum.
He never came through here.
He didn't?
No, he didn't.
Do you have a particular interest in our patient's X-rays?
- What do you mean?
- I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.
- It's a hobby of mine.
- It's a hobby, really?
What's your other hobby, brain surgery?
- What do you want?
- To know how that boy got to surgery.
I'm a janitor. I do as I'm told.
That's bullshit!
Who changed those orders?
I don't know what you mean.
You stay right there.
Call Security!
Tell Stevens to get hold of that guy Kelly over at C.P.D.
A guy disguised as a janitor orders an emergency medical procedure...
...and all you did was take away his I.D. card?
No, I called Security. He took off down the hall. What was I supposed to do?
Listen, Mr... .
Deputy.
Gerard.
I'm really tired.
I'd like to go home now.
Okay. How's the boy doing?
He saved his life.
Thank you.
"Desmondo, José Ruiz. "
Where're you at, Desmondo?
Okay, Sam, this is my problem.
The place is crawling with cops, right?
Everybody's looking for
Richard Kimble, right?
So why would a guy be stupid enough...
...to hang out in the trauma ward and play Mother Teresa?
Excuse me.
You, guys, have a problem?
No, no. No problem at all.
Excuse me, could we have a word with you, please?
This is Dr. Elway at Cook County Hospital.
I'm following-up for the prosthetic clinic on Matthew Zelick.
Oh, he did?
I'm terribly sorry.
Right or left?
Right.
- Age?
- 35 to 45.
This is Ted Riley with the High School Reunion Committee.
25 years are right around the corner...
...and Clive is on our list of missing in action.
The information gave me a number, but when I tried it...
No kidding.
Armed robbery?
He's where?
Point of attachments?
Mid-humerus.
That gives us 47 possibles.
Cross-check these people for criminal records.
Wait a minute.
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.
Driscoll, Clive R.
One-armed man, armed robbery.
That's funny.
Question:
If they can dye this river green today...
...why can't they dye it blue the other days?
How do I know?
- So, what are you Irish, sir?
- Who, me? No.
Are you?
No, man!
Name of inmate?
Clive Driscoll.
Driscoll, Clive.
I.D., please.
Driscoll, Clive R.
Be advised that under federal court ruling, your conversation can be recorded.
Sign here, please!
This is hinky. He is a college graduate.
He wouldn't go through all this security...
...go to the county lock-up to find someone his own people say doesn't exist.
Hinky.
What does that mean, "hinky"?
- Strange.
- Weird.
Say "strange" or "weird. " "Hinky" has no meaning.
Why not say "hinky"?
I don't want you using meaningless words around me. I'm taking the stairs.
How about "bullshit"?
Visitor for Driscoll.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Over there.
Let's go, Driscoll.
You've got five minutes.
Who the hell are you?
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
You got me down here...
...might as well talk.
Down here you got no entertainment.
Ain't no cable here.
Listen, pal, I wish I could, but I can't.
Sorry.
Richard!
There is a man in a blue coat waving a gun and screaming... at a woman.
Stop that man!
He's a U.S. marshal! Let him go!
Let him go!
Close the gates!
Hold it!
Open the doors!
We're on the roof.
We're on the roof.
Take some men! Look down there!
Jesus, he's in the plaza, Sam!
He's heading east!
He's going east toward the Picasso!
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel that
Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?
I have no idea.
We understand your deputies were at the hospital today.
Was Dr. Kimble at the hospital?
I don't have any comment on that one.
Let me get the chronology straight.
The subject was tried, convicted, incarcerated...
...escaped, presumed dead, and is now at large in Chicago. Is that correct, sir?
Except for being presumed dead.
Do you believe that Kimble's armed and dangerous?
I believe he's dangerous, yes.
He's taking chances, coming back. Do you feel that perhaps he might be innocent?
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted in a court of law. He's guilty.
How will you try to catch him?
We have no further comments for now.
Alec.
Richard Kimble.
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, Dr. Kimble.
Lentz!
Sorry, we've been trading phone calls the last few days.
A cruise sponsored by Devlin MacGregor...
...that could be fun.
- Cancún, Richard.
- Sport fishing.
Piña coladas.
What must the hospital buy?
What's the catch?
Sailfish.
No, there are no strings attached.
So what do you say? So what do you say?
This guy is bleeding from every needle puncture.
Lentz sent this guy in?
Is he on that wonder drug?
Yes, he's on the RDU-90 protocol, Provasic.
Drug of the future, boys.
Clean out those arteries and put us out of business.
"Parade Master of Ceremonies
Ed O'Flaherty said...
"...he didn't recall a livelier parade during the last 20 years.
"That Kimble...
"...is some kind of lad... "
- "Lad? "
- Yeah, "lad. "
Maybe he's a leprechaun.
I'm quoting this guy.
Some guy on line three claims he's Richard Kimble.
- Who is it?
- We got another Kimble on line three.
Let me see that phone.
Tell him he looks good in a beard.
- What line?
- Three.
"I hope he was able to wear a little green, sip some whiskey..."
This is Gerard.
Do you remember what I told you in the tunnel?
It's him!
I remember it was noisy.
Well, I think you said something like...
...you didn't kill your wife.
Remember what you told me?
I remember you were pointing my gun at me.
You said, "I don't care. "
He's on the south side.
Yeah, Richard, that's right, I don't care.
I'm not trying to solve a puzzle, here.
Well, I am trying to solve a puzzle.
Five seconds to location.
And I just found a big piece.
Hello, Richard?
He didn't hang up the phone.
Where is he?
256 South St. Lawrence.
Get the C.P.D. right the hell over there.
We got a car there now.
Get a couple of shots of that.
Fredrick Sykes...
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.
You want to look at this?
Kimble's prints. They're all over...
...but mainly on the desk.
He sure had some interest in these photographs.
Negatives in there?
Let me have them.
- Camera boy's on his way.
- We got you.
How're you doing, Mr. Sykes?
- Fine, if you tell me what's happening.
- We had a problem.
- My place or the place upstairs?
- Your place.
Step right in, Mr. Sykes.
Everybody knows my name here.
Big happy family, huh?
What is this, a trench coat convention?
What the hell is going on?
Who are you guys? What's going on?
You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.
I sure hope you're a cop.
No, I'm Samuel Gerard,
United States Marshal's Office.
This morning a fugitive named Richard
Kimble made a phone call from here.
Why would he do that?
I don't know any Richard Kimble.
Okay, I got it.
The doctor who killed his wife, right?
Keep blaming somebody with a prosthetic limb. Is he coming after me?
Does he have reason to do so?
I have a prosthetic arm! I must've done it!
Give me a break.
I went through all this a year ago.
I was questioned here about the whole thing.
I told them I wasn't in Chicago on that night. I was on business trip.
15 people verified it.
What line of business are you in?
Security.
- Who do you work for?
- A pharmaceutical company.
Which one?
Devlin MacGregor.
I handle security for all the top executives.
Do you have any idea why Kimble would be interested in these photographs?
No.
Where were they taken?
Gee, that's a big fish!
Cancún, Mexico.
It was a junket the company paid for some doctors.
- Kimble go with you?
- You don't see him there, do you?
No. I told you I don't know him.
Do you mind if I look around to see if anything's missing?
No, I don't mind.
How'd you lose that arm?
In the line of duty.
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.
Yes, he is.
- You want our people on him?
- Yes. Build a camp here.
I'll take care of it.
See this picture? I want you to find out who's the guy next to Sykes.
Find out his name, his age, his weight, his social security number...
...his location, relatives, pets, everything.
I am so sorry, Doctor, they said it was an emergency.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Mr. Bolton.
Chuck.
Richard.
Yeah, can you talk?
Yes, I'm on a hotel phone.
So how are you? What's going on?
I found him, Chuck.
I found the man who killed Helen.
- What?
- It was me they were after.
Who are they?
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.
Lentz was supervising the protocol for RDU-90.
He knew I found out it was causing liver damage. It was Lentz.
Richard, Lentz is dead.
What? How?
He died in a car accident last summer.
Can you prove this about the drug?
Yeah, I think so.
I need your help, Chuck.
Call Bones at the hospital.
Tell him to give me whatever help I need.
I'll call him now.
Okay. Thanks.
Dr. Nichols!
Can we ask you a few more questions?
Mr. Gerard.
You got a copy of that photograph?
U.S. Marshal Service.
Excuse us.
This is Fredrick Sykes.
He's a security specialist at
Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.
Do you know this man?
No, I don't know him.
You're getting pretty desperate, aren't you, Mr. Gerard?
Oh, yeah.
I told you, you wouldn't find Richard.
- Has he been to see you?
- No.
We've been over this ground before, haven't we?
- So, if you'll excuse me.
- Sure.
- Thanks, Doc.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Sorry, I want to ask you one more question about the photograph.
See the guy standing on the right side of the fish?
Ever see him before?
This guy right here?
I've never seen that person in my life before.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.
Enjoy the rest of the convention.
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-Invasive
Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.
"Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols. "
Bet they line up to hear this one.
If you were Richard Kimble...
...why would you hunt for a one-armed man you say killed your wife...
...break into his house, call us up and then split?
I should have been a doctor.
Look at this blow-up. This guy in the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.
Chicago Memorial.
I want to go there.
Go!
Wait.
Devlin MacGregor...
...did 7 1/2 billion dollars in net sales...
...last year alone.
That company is a monster.
Yeah, talk to me.
Absolutely.
It's a liver sample...
...from a patient on the RDU-90 drug study.
21. January 21st?
The last one!
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.
Thanks. I'll make sure all this stuff gets back to you.
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.
So whatever happened to that thing with your wife?
It's not over yet.
What's going on?
How should I know?
I think his name is Lentz. A pathologist.
I remember because he died last summer.
Oh, my God. Richard!
What are you doing here?
Hi, Kath.
Have a look.
- What do you think?
- Cold normal.
Clearly not the same tissue.
And not only did they all come from healthy livers...
...they all came from the same liver.
Kath, you beauty.
Excuse me.
Mr. Roosevelt?
I am Deputy Biggs, this is
Deputy Newman. We're U.S. marshals.
Need some information about a
Dr. Lentz who was on staff here.
I want to know if he knew or have had any contact with a Dr. Richard Kimble?
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.
I didn't ask that.
I wouldn't know.
If you'll excuse me,
I have prior obligations to attend to.
I think you're lying to us.
You think Lentz is the bad guy?
Yeah, why not?
He was one of the original patent boys in RDU-90.
I was sending in my tissue samples...
...he was replacing them with healthy samples, issuing the path reports...
...shit-canning my stuff. Easy.
Wait a minute.
Lentz died August 21st.
Half the samples he approved were signed the day he died.
You're kidding.
Someone else must have been manipulating this.
Someone with access.
Thanks, Kath.
Where're you going?
To see a friend.
This is giving me a headache.
That's surprising. Where did
Roosevelt say Kimble was going?
He says he doesn't know.
- Do you believe him?
- Yes, I do.
He says he was here to pick up some tissue samples...
...for a drug study.
But listen, get this.
The release was approved by Dr. Charles Nichols.
Nichols also knew Lentz.
He was Lentz's boss.
He was covering for Kimble.
Send the C.P.D. over there right now.
We're going to send a bunch of cops.
Make sure they turn that place inside out.
Don't let them give you shit about your ponytail either. Well done.
My pleasure, Sam.
Dr. Nichols lied to me.
- Go find him.
- I'm on it.
He's gone by now.
I looked every place you told me to look and I didn't see him.
I'm telling you.
If he was in the hospital,
I would have found him.
So what do you want me to do?
Hold on. Wait a minute.
I marked him. I got him now.
Dr. Alexander Lentz.
"A noted pathologist at
Chicago Memorial Hospital...
"...was walking to his daily tennis match when an unidentified vehicle...
"...slammed his body...
"...into the barriers that separate the Drive from Lake Michigan. "
Sam, you're not going to believe this.
Sykes' records for the past two years show no calls to Kimble.
It was a thought.
But when I cross-checked
Kimble's phone records, one came up.
Kimble called Sykes...
Get Sykes in here now.
...on the night of the murder...
...7:30 P. M...
...from his car phone.
Do you have the arrest report on Kimble?
- 7:30 P.M.
- 19:30 hours.
They just went in. Sykes is gone.
He's nowhere to be found.
He's gone.
Possible sighting of Richard Kimble on northbound El coming into Van Buren.
Move to the door, Doc.
This is my stop.
This is my stop too.
You missed your stop.
A transit cop spotted Kimble on the El, he is heading toward Balbo.
The C.P.D. is on the way.
Attention all units. Transit police report officer down at Balbo Station.
Kimble is suspect. Repeat officer down.
What'd he do, shoot a cop?
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.
It is a joy and a privilege... to introduce tonight's keynote speaker.
For the past four years...
...he has served as the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...
...and Administrative Chief of Pathology...
...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.
Where are the emergency exits?
Suspect seen entering Hilton Tower Mall, lower level. Repeat...
You don't think...
I know where he's going.
Biggs, Newman, where are you?
He was appointed to the Board of Directors...
...of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.
You all please give a warm welcome...
...to Dr. Charles Nichols.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen...
...my friends and colleagues.
It's great you're all here tonight.
C.P.D. reported an officer down and a guy with two guns...
- Kimble do it?
- Conflicting reports.
He entered the hotel from the subway.
- That's my man!
- Not anymore.
He's going down.
You can help by staying out.
Arrest us!
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.
All units report when lower level is secure.
All units, secure all lower level exits.
Go and find the hotel security office.
Stay in touch with me on the radio.
Now, a new drug...
...on the cusp of approval by the Food and Drug Administration...
...is poised to change these old methods forever.
Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.
Sam, I'm in.
...through the normal metabolic pathways in the liver.
The drug's name is...
...Provasic.
As I will show you tonight...
...Provasic is remarkably effective...
...and has no side effects whatsoever.
It is also noteworthy that this drug...
...that this drug was developed...
...in cooperation, not competition with Chicago Memorial Hospital...
...in what we hope will be...
...the model for a continued dishonest...
...excuse me, honest...
...open joint venture...
...between academic medicine...
...and the pharmaceutical industry...
Richard!
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of this speech.
You almost got away with it.
I know all about it.
I can prove it.
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend
Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...
...obviously...
...so if you just go on with your dessert and coffee...
Richard, would you step aside and let's talk.
So I'll be back in just a second.
You changed the samples, didn't you?
You switched the samples...
...after Lentz died.
Let's stay calm, people.
After Lentz died, you were the only one who had access.
You switched the samples...
...and the pathology reports.
You killed Lentz too?
Call Security.
Did you?
He falsified his research...
...so RDU-90 could be...
...approved and...
...Devlin MacGregor could give you Provasic.
All right, it's all over, folks.
Let's just stay calm.
You never give up, Richard, do you?
You never give up!
Why Helen?
Glad you're here.
Which way'd they go?
- Toward the Presidential Suite.
- Where's that?
- Southeast corner.
- How many exits are there in this room?
We got a total of four:
Two on the east, two on the west.
Kimble's on the roof!
Cosmo, that way.
Stop! Stay where you are!
This is the Chicago police!
Put your hands in the air!
The building is totally secure.
I repeat, do not move!
Put your hands in the air!
I repeat, stay where you are!
Talk to me.
They're headed to the north end of the roof.
Newman!
Get that helicopter out of here!
As soon as you get a clean shot...
...you take him out.
Newman, get rid of the helicopter!
- Why?
- Because I don't want to get shot!
C.P.D., there's a U.S. marshal out on the roof. Hold your fire!
Call off the helicopter!
Don't shoot.
This guy ever quit?
Find out where that elevator stops.
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?
Where did they go? Where did they go?
- Stopped on the 5th floor.
- They're on the 5th floor.
- What's on the 5th floor?
- It's the laundry.
They stopped at the laundry.
We're on the 5th floor. What's your 20?
It's right behind you.
What the hell is going on here?
You got to keep the C.P.D. out.
They're much too hot to suit me.
I want you to get rid of all these people.
Okay, people, stay calm.
Cosmo, come with me.
Dr. Richard Kimble!
There's no way out of here, Richard!
The entire building is locked down!
Give it up, you don't have any time!
Chicago Police Department thinks you're a cop killer!
They will shoot you on sight!
Richard, I know you're innocent!
I know about Fredrick Sykes!
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!
Richard, he borrowed your car the night of your wife's murder!
He had the keys!
No forced entry, Richard.
He telephoned Sykes from your car, Richard!
Give it up!
I'm either lying to you or
I'm going to shoot you!
What do you think?
Give it up! It's time to stop running!
They killed my wife.
I know it, Richard.
I know it.
But, it's over now.
You know, I'm glad.
I need the rest.
Who killed Kimble's wife?
Kimble was convicted of it.
You've got a one-armed man in custody.
- Is that the guy?
- I have no idea.
How many one-armed men are there?
There're a lot of them.
Could you have made a mistake?
You got a deadline, play the weather again.
Tell Samuel Gerard I'm going home now.
I'm taking my vacation.
Clear this area. Everybody clear.
Watch your head.
Where is that thing?
Let me see those hands, Doctor.
I thought you didn't care.
I don't.
Don't tell anybody, okay?
You want to know all about me, don't you?
Well, let's see, now.
The first time I was in love was June, 1975, in Boca Raton.
Her name was Coty Pierce.
She lived there with her parents and her little sister, Karrie.
And I loved her, too.
I loved them both, and they were in love with me.
They just didn't know it.
No one did.
I lived with them all that June.
I don't understand.
I lived in the attic.
I was watching.
I loved the expression on their faces when they slept.
And then I decided to declare myself and show them how much they loved me.
- What happened?
- What happened?
Coty was honored.
She kissed me back.
And then Karrie.
And finally that night,
I kissed their mother, too.
Just a little pinprick. There.
Kiss me.
That's it. You guys watching this?
Good. Knock it back! Knock it back!
Good.
But you gotta remember, this game is 80% winning and 20% talent.
You've got to keep running.
That's it, that's it, that's it.
That's my boy.
Good. Bring an uppercut.
Right hand. Good.
I don't want you to fall on your face
'cause you missed that jab.
What am I always telling you?
Power comes from leverage and technique.
You paying attention?
I gotta go, guys.
But you pair off and hit the heavy bag.
Three rounds each. Let's go.
How long has she been inside?
I'm on my way.
Their names are
Edmund and Dianne Wainford, ages 48 and 42.
An item about seven years, no prior complaints.
Neighbours are saying the usual, they were divorced, they were married, they were separated, they were reconciled, or in the process of.
His idea, her idea, no one has a clue.
All I know is that's Edmund, and Dianne's in the bedroom.
- Whose gun?
- You stupid fucking bitch!
He had a.38
Smith & Wesson registered.
Look like a.38 to you?
You want a vest?
I don't think I'll need one.
Dianne?
This is Alex Cross, DCPD.
I need to talk to you.
Okay?
Dianne, I'm gonna open the door, all right?
I'm going to open it now.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Please. Please, Dianne.
Look, I'm gonna close this door.
I'm gonna move this chair, okay, and block the door.
That way nobody comes in, and this stays between me and you, okay?
Could you take the gun out of your mouth, please?
Look, it's just as effective if you put it to your temple.
Just makes it easier to talk.
- What sort of policeman are you?
- I'm a forensic psychologist.
It's a fancy way of saying I'm a guy who walks into a room like that and determines the hows and whys.
Then you don't need to hear from me.
No, no. I don't.
But I need for you to confirm a couple of things for me.
For instance, did Edmund often beat you after he drank?
And the turtleneck you're wearing, is that to hide bruises?
Do you often have to hide marks that he put on your body?
Two weeks ago, he hit me.
And I swore it was the last time.
I finally get the nerve to leave that son of a bitch, and then he suckers me back.
You know what I think, Dianne?
I think you did what you had to do.
Thing now is just to figure out how to finish things off.
The right way, Dianne. The right way.
Look, is it all right if I come a little closer?
Thanks.
Now, as I see it, all we have to do is get photographs of your bruises.
Now, I know at least half a dozen top-notch lawyers.
They specialise in battered women's defences.
Point is, Dianne, if you pull the trigger, no one will ever know the truth.
Can I have it?
Dianne?
Samp, what are you doing here?
Doughnut raid?
Alex, hold on.
Look, May's inside.
- Yeah?
- We got a call from Durham today.
Durham?
Naomi is missing. Come on.
What do you mean, "missing"?
They called May this afternoon from the law school.
She called me. I called them back.
Told them who you were, her uncle, and all that.
They said she's been missing for four days.
Four days?
But Durham Police is on it now.
The guy I talked to sounded solid.
Don't talk to him, talk to me.
They stole my child!
Now, May, just take it easy.
Take it easy.
We're going to handle this together, but with your high blood pressure,
I need you to relax right now, okay?
- Yeah, but what if...
- Now, now, now, now, you just take it easy.
Relax and breathe. Look at me, look at me. I want to tell you something.
Do you remember when Naomi was about 10 years old, she got lost?
You got all frantic because you thought we'd never find her.
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.
You were worried she'd have an asthma attack or something.
Remember that?
Turns out she was with the neighbours and everything was just fine.
Well, everything is gonna be fine now,
'cause I'm going to handle this myself, May.
And you know you can trust me, right?
- You know I'm going to handle this.
- I trust you.
Okay.
Now, Nana is going to take you up to Janell's room.
- You just relax for a while.
- I don't need to relax.
May.
Yeah.
Good. All right.
I'll have to go down there.
Listen, Alex. Stay here.
Come on, John.
If they got a chance to wrap it up down there, how long do you think they're going to hunt for one lost black girl?
Just stay here, man. I'll go down there.
There's nothing you can do anyway.
It's out of your jurisdiction.
You don't understand.
I got to go.
Please talk to me.
Talk to me the way you used to.
Please, say something.
Please. I'm sorry.
I can be better.
I can be good.
I won't be bad any more.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Please, I swear.
- You promise?
- Yeah.
I'll make you happy.
How?
Let me show you.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me!
I love you.
Megan, I don't believe you.
I love you.
Of course you do.
Good afternoon, Sergeant.
Dr Alex Cross, Washington DCPD.
I'd like to see Chief Hatfield, please.
Well, Doctor, the Chief's tied up at the moment.
We'll let him know you're here.
I'm sure he will be with you as soon as he possibly can.
Take a load off.
Thank you.
- Sign this, sir.
- Dr Cross.
You've been waiting for us for a while.
About two hours.
Well, we got us a laid-back way down here.
- So I see.
- Good.
- Run these names through the printer.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about the wait.
Nick Ruskin.
Nick.
- Davey Sikes.
- Sikes.
It's been real busy around here.
We got a homicide, and not your garden-variety, either.
Meaning?
That's all I know.
We are heading out there now.
You can ride with us if you like.
The board shows eight women missing.
How closely connected are they?
Well, they all share the same profile.
Young, late teens, early 20s, pretty, all from inside the Research Triangle.
And each of them was ambushed.
No witnesses. Does his homework.
And then he ties them naked to a tree and chops off their hair.
Only two bodies have been found.
This will probably be the third.
And the killer left a note for us at the second murder scene.
- Signed it "Casanova."
- Casanova. The great lover.
This one here, is she white, black or...
All we know is she's a young woman who didn't die happy.
Our Chief Hatfield will be up at the scene.
I'll bet you two will get along like pigs in a blanket.
Well, it's not her.
Dr Cross. My boss, Chief Hatfield.
Chief.
Now, is it Detective Cross, or Dr Cross, or Dr Detective Cross?
Well, at a time like this, Chief, it really doesn't matter.
As you can see, it's not your niece.
I'm happy for you.
Figured out who she is?
Megan Murphy. University sophomore.
I told your Captain Hathaway
I'd extend help any way we could given your special situation and all.
- Appreciate that.
- I want you to consider yourself my guest. Make yourself at home.
But don't mess around in the kitchen.
Understand me?
Well, the TV news crews can't be far behind.
The best-selling crime author has arrived.
Kyle, it's good to see you.
You, too.
- I thought you were in Rochester.
- Well, things change.
I see you're making friends fast.
Done my best.
I heard about your niece. I'm sorry.
How long has this been on the Bureau's wish list?
A while.
Were the other two tied up so extravagantly?
Yeah, our guy seems to find square knots tedious.
You saw it's Dayton cordage, 7-gauge.
Yeah, America's favorite.
I suppose everything else was too prolific to trace.
The guy's a pro.
A real student of the game, and an enthusiastic rapist.
First two post-mortems indicate vaginal tears like I've seldom seen inflicted hours before death.
And then that's it.
No prints or fibres, no semen or hair.
Except what he cut off her.
What about cause of death?
Well, there are no signs of torture, no weight loss, no drugging.
He just ties them up and leaves them for the critters.
- Real student of the game.
- And he likes to play.
We've liaisoned with the campus police.
Posted flyers.
Figured somebody out there had to have seen something important.
An environment fit for blending.
For you, a security nightmare.
For him, paradise.
We're going to get this animal.
We've got a critically injured eight-year-old girl thrown from a motorcycle, no helmet.
She's going to get a CAT scan as soon as you get her stable.
It's the third grade.
What is she doing on a motorcycle?
Her daddy decided to take her for a ride.
The pressure bandage on this brachial is about to go.
We're a minute away from a 30-second bleed-out.
I need a tourniquet.
Retractors are ready.
- I'm going to do a cutdown.
- Watch your pressure drop.
Scalpel, please, Nurse.
Gauze and suture.
- What's her name?
- Laura.
It's an awful lot of blood for such a little girl, Laura.
Stand by, Nurse, with the bandages.
Stand by.
I'll try to put you back together again.
I would suggest that you buy something over the counter first
- and see if that helps...
- Excuse me, Nurse?
Just a minute.
It doesn't sound like this is too severe.
- Hi, Mrs Lee. I'm Dr McTiernan. Hi.
- Doctor?
Hello.
She's alive.
Mrs Lee, wait...
Mrs Lee, Mrs Lee, listen.
Laura has suffered severe head trauma and she is in a coma.
You can be with her as soon as...
Please let me see my baby!
I want to see the jab! Come on.
There you go. Good.
Now, move around the ring.
Around the ring. What are you doing?
Come on, back him up. Let's go.
Don't stay there. Back up.
Watch your contact.
Okay, Barry off. Ethan, stay on.
Who's next?
Kate, let's go.
Okay.
Bring your snaps.
Go get him.
All right, let's keep it light, guys.
Come on, Kate, let's see something.
Come on.
I want to see the jab. Stick the jab in there. There you go. Good!
Come on, stick it.
Let me see the jab.
Come on, on your toes. Use the jab.
Come on, girl!
Nice! Good!
Okay, good. Let's go, work it.
Come on, on your toes!
Come on, Ethan! What's going on?
Good!
Ethan, what are you doing?
Watch your contact, okay?
Kate, are you okay?
This is a sorry substitute for sex.
- I said, this is a sorry substitute...
- I heard you.
Yeah, okay.
- You know what I'm looking for?
- What?
The way my daddy looked at my mother.
What way?
Not gonna settle for anything less.
Sure picks lookers, doesn't he?
Yeah, he does.
Still, these women are more than just attractive.
They are all extraordinary in some way.
Smart, talented.
Something tells me he ain't choosing them just for their congeniality.
Ordinarily, they don't.
But I think our guy is a little different.
- How so?
- I think killing is not his ulterior motive.
This guy's a collector.
I bet these women are alive.
Come on, Doc. Our boy's brain is as soft as a two-minute egg.
And nothing personal, but I figure every one of them gals is tied to a tree just waiting to get found.
Well, think about it, Sikes.
The three you found were killed out of sequence.
They weren't even among the first abducted.
- That's right.
- Yeah, but that don't mean that they're not still out there.
But, hell, you would have found them by now.
He makes absolutely no attempt to hide them.
And the way they were killed is very revealing.
- That last long walk through the woods.
- Marching to their fate.
Exactly.
The rape, cutting off her hair...
- It's a punishment.
- Maybe for violating some trust.
What goddamn trust?
I don't know, Chief.
I don't know.
How would you like to pay?
Actually, there's another book
I'm interested in.
It's a picture book for children in the hospital. It's about being brave.
It sounds like a book by Burke.
I'll see if we have it in stock.
Good night, fish.
- What do you want from me?
- Everything.
Show me something.
Take it back. That's better.
Show me something.
Show me something.
There it is. Come on, show me something. Shake me, baby.
Shake me.
Hit it, hit it, hit it.
You can't hold me, baby!
What is that, man?
Just get the ball, baby.
This is my court. This is my court!
Let me show you how we do it.
Here it is, here it is.
- All right, all right.
- Come on.
What you got? What you got?
That's all you got? That's all you got?
Get back, get back.
Get mad, get mad. What's up?
Hey, hey, hey!
- Come on, fellas!
- Break it off!
Hey, hey, come on!
Don't ever come back again.
Let me go. Let me go.
Don't ever come back here again!
Get out of here. It's my court!
Seth Samuels?
I'm Dr Alex Cross.
Naomi's uncle.
And a cop.
Look, I don't recall inviting you here, so you...
Can we talk for a minute or two?
Like I said,
I don't recall inviting you here.
Look, we can talk anywhere you want.
I already told you guys everything I know.
Which was nothing.
Look, I've had cops on me for days.
In the middle of the night, hauling me down to the station, all up my ass about Naomi and things that are none of nobody's fucking business.
Looks like your business is in the public domain, doesn't it, Seth?
What do you want to know?
I want to know about Naomi's violin.
It's not on the police inventory.
Is it here?
Well, she used to practise here sometimes.
She was always practising on the thing.
But she always took it home with her.
Always.
Yeah, I know.
The cops don't have any idea, do they?
Not a clue.
I got all the glass out.
Everything you'll need to change the dressing is right next to you.
I brought some of your clothes, too.
Something for every occasion.
Can you hear me?
Systemic analgesic.
What did you give me?
That's one of the reasons
I picked you, Kate.
Your intelligence.
I appreciate that.
I know most men don't.
Can't.
I'm different. You'll see that in time.
Now, try not to go back to sleep.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I need to tell you the rules.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Why am I here?
- You are here to fall in love.
To experience love.
But now I need you to listen very carefully, and take what I say very seriously.
All right?
Don't try to escape.
Don't cry out for help.
And do not try any of your kickboxing tricks.
Do you understand?
Now, I'll do what I can to help you not break these rules.
But if you do, Kate, you will really disappoint me.
That's it.
There.
See? That didn't hurt, did it?
Don't worry.
You are with Casanova.
Yes?
I thought you'd be out. Busy.
Well, you were wrong.
You've got mail.
You like?
Nice.
Exceptional. Really.
I think she's extra special.
How are you feeling, old man?
Swimmers, take your mark!
Come on, keep going!
Move those bodies, let's go!
Kick it up, kick it, move it, move it!
Speed, speed, muscle, muscle!
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
I'm looking for Dr Wick Sachs.
Lane five. He's destroying my varsity.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Let's go, blondie! Pick it up!
I can't tell you much you don't already know, I'm afraid.
I gave Naomi some academic guidance, which she politely disregarded.
And that was that. Excuse me.
I really don't have time to get to know my patients very well.
Although I do know that Naomi was a special woman.
My heart goes out to you.
Word is that you make time to get to know some of your special patients.
Whatever you may have heard,
I certainly don't have time to kidnap and mutilate any of them.
I understand how you must feel, you being a psychologist, and a policeman, and her uncle.
It must be like suffering the tortures of the damned.
For me or for her?
Well, both.
It's yours.
He's never made strikes this close together before, has he?
An intern?
Yeah.
He had a vacancy.
Never call out.
Never call out. Never call out.
Somebody help me!
My name is Kate!
I'm Kate McTiernan.
I'm a doctor at the Carolina
Regional Medical Centre.
I need help!
I know you can hear me!
Come on! Who's out there?
Somebody help...
My name is Kate McTiernan.
Somebody talk to me!
- Who is out there?
- Be quiet.
Be quiet, or he'll kill you.
Oh, my God.
What's your name?
What's your name? Talk to me.
Talk to me please, please, please!
Tell me your name.
I'm Mary Jane Capaldi.
It's good to...
It's good to hear your voice, Mary Jane.
Are you okay?
I'm Kristen Miles. I'm here, too.
I'm Melissa Stanfield.
I don't know how long I've been here.
What month is it?
I'm Samantha Gaines.
Carol Akers.
My name is Naomi Cross.
I've been here for eight days, I think.
Yeah, I know.
I miss you, too, darling.
No, you know I do.
How's May?
Oh, that's good.
You stay with her now, you hear?
Hang on, Janell. Just a second.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"Odalisques were the most valuable of the Emperor's treasures,"
"gifted in the arts of music and poetry."
- Talented.
- Special.
"Welcome to Durham, Dr Cross."
"Giovanni Giacomo
Casanova De Seingalt."
I guess you've got a fan.
I'll say one thing for our boy.
He's got very nice penmanship.
He's fucking with you. That's all it is.
Yeah, but this tells us he's tracking the case.
He's reading the local papers.
We can use that...
An odalisque is a statue, right?
A tall, pointy thing with...
No, you're thinking obelisk, Nick.
Odalisque is a harem girl, a concubine, sex slave.
There it is, just like you said.
So he's telling us all these gals are alive.
Why is he telling us that?
It demonstrates his power.
His dominance.
Well, that certainly fits. Our profiles of the murdered women show they all shared one trait that would have set off the control freak in our guy.
They're all strong-willed.
They're all defiant.
And how many of the other girls share that profile?
At least one.
You wanna hurt me?
Okay, come on.
They can be bigger.
Okay.
And they can be stronger...
You're fucking nuts!
I'll beat you.
Oh, my God!
You could have been the best, Kate.
I may be going crazy here, but didn't I warn you about breaking the rules?
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry."
- I'll do anything you want.
- What?
- What did you say?
- I said, I'll do anything you want.
I know you will.
Give me your arm.
I said, give me your arm.
Come on. Give it to me.
Kate!
This is not the way it works, Kate.
All right, now. Okay.
Easy, girl. Easy, now. Come on.
- What do you know?
- Only that she's in some kind of shock.
The kids who found her were fishing near the Wykagyl white water.
- The what?
- Wykagyl. It's a river way out of town.
Well, lookie here.
We got us a circus up ahead.
Here are the cops.
- Detectives, can you confirm...
- Come on, back... Back up, now.
What concerns us is behavior that suggests psychological trauma, especially acute.
Doctor, Doctor, can you tell us exactly when she'll be able to talk to us?
What I'm getting at is Kate McTiernan appears to be suffering from post-traumatic shock.
There's no telling when she'll be lucid.
It could be hours. It could be weeks.
You guys have to remember that this girl is very lucky to be alive.
Doctor...
Can you at least tell us your best guess?
We can't go on that, Doc.
Can you just...
Dr Ruocco, excuse me.
My name is Cross. I'm Dr Alex Cross.
Yes, I know who you are.
I know your work.
I'm consulting with the local police on this case.
I need to see Kate McTiernan.
I'm sorry, but she does not need another doctor.
Listen, the last thing I want is to crowd you.
My request is personal.
One of the women abducted was my niece.
I really need to talk to this woman.
It's all right. It's all right.
You're safe now.
You're safe.
- This woman's a fighter.
- I wouldn't argue with that.
But we were off pegging this as post-traumatic shock.
Her vitals are meandering downhill.
Everything is systematically shutting down.
And of course, you screened her for drugs.
Yes, we did.
Her blood, her urine, they're clean.
Something is doing damage that we don't have a finger on.
- Whoever did this...
- Is cunning.
Yeah, he's cunning.
But he doesn't know his history.
The real Casanova would never have approved.
Excuse me. Do you have a PDR?
Unresponsive pupils, progressive loss of muscular control,
- escalating tremors...
- That's what I see.
An overdose of benzodiazepine would do all that.
Yes, but every drug in the benzo family shows up in blood and urine.
Except Sistol. It's a benzo cousin.
Leukaemia specialists are using it to take the edge off chemo.
- Is it an amnesiac?
- Absolutely.
We'll see what your theory is made of by morning.
Who are you?
My name is Alex Cross.
I'm a policeman from Washington DC.
How do you feel?
Sick.
- I'll get you a doctor. Hang on.
- Wait, wait, I was given a drug.
I think it was the nervous system.
Yeah, it was something called Sistol.
But we flushed it out of you.
It's nice to have you back.
- Washington?
- Yeah.
I'm... I'm down here because of my niece.
She disappeared about 10 days ago.
Her name is Naomi Cross.
I talked to her.
Thank you.
I'll get that doctor for you.
I...
I heard so many different voices, and I tried not to cry.
No way does our boy show his face here.
If he's not here, he's watching.
I guarantee you.
You make it sound like he ain't cooking on the front burner.
If he's so dumb, how come we haven't caught him yet?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to introduce to you a very brave young lady.
Dr Kate McTiernan.
Dr McTiernan will make a brief statement, and that's all.
No questions, please.
Hello, I'm Kate McTiernan.
First, I'd like to say something to the families who have a loved one missing.
Please, do not give up hope.
There are other women where I was held.
And I believe in my heart that they're still alive.
Second, to the boys who fished me out of the river and saved my life, and to the nurses and doctors here who are taking such excellent care of me, and for the thousands of letters and prayers
I've received from all across America, thank you.
And last, to the man who calls himself Casanova, the man who took me from my own home and ultimately tried to kill me,
I broke your rules. Just me.
None of the other women helped.
So if you're looking for someone to blame, blame me.
That's all I have to say right now.
Thank you for taking my message to the families of the missing.
And I hope it helps a little bit.
Thank you.
- Dr McTiernan...
- What's the boys' names?
- What do you hear? Dogs?
- No.
- Any kind of animals? Is it a farm?
- I don't know.
- Do you hear the river?
- No.
I hear him whispering.
What does he say?
I can feel his mouth on my ear.
His breath.
He tells me that he loves me.
Tell me about his face.
Tell me about his eyes, his mouth.
He has no face.
A mask. He always wears a mask.
- What kind of mask?
- I can't...
- What does it look like?
- It changes.
I can't show him that I hate him.
But you escaped.
What do you see when you escape?
I don't know.
I'm just running, and my legs are heavy from the drugs.
And I'm lost. I'm running through hallways and there are all these rooms.
I don't know where to turn.
- He's behind me!
- He's not behind you, Kate.
You get away.
How? How do you get out?
Light.
Light. In the light, in the sun.
- Do you see a barn?
- No.
- A house?
- No.
- Cabin?
- No!
There's nothing. Just the light.
It hurts my eyes.
And then the trees. The trees again.
And the rocks are digging into my feet, and I hear him shouting behind me, and I try to run faster.
That's all I'm thinking, "Just run faster!"
And I left those girls behind.
I wasn't thinking.
- I just told myself to run, to run and run.
- All right, all right, all right.
It's okay. It's all right.
- I left those girls...
- It's all right. It's all behind you.
You pretty familiar with these woods?
- Yeah, I come up here sometimes.
- What do you run into up here?
I mean, beside the obvious, hikers, bikers, campers?
Locals, college kids. That's about it.
- What about this river?
- It's good for trout fishing.
It's been that way since the early colonial period. It's over here.
What? What?
I still have to remember that my niece wouldn't be fooling around
- with some knucklehead.
- Right.
Kate?
You okay?
I'm fine.
Really, I am. I'm fine.
I'm just sorry I can't take you to her.
I made an interesting discovery last night.
About what?
I ran a check on all the Sistol orders over the last five years.
- Guess what?
- What?
A Beverly Hills plastic surgeon came up on the list.
There's no protocol for Sistol in plastic surgery.
Bingo.
Two years ago, this guy ordered enough to treat leukaemia in a medium-sized country.
- What's his name?
- Rudolph. William Rudolph.
Grew up in Durham.
Did his premed work here.
Dr Cross, is it him? Is he bicoastal?
Bicoastal?
That's an interesting way of putting it.
There are about a dozen predators operating in California now.
There's one, male Caucasian, probably early 30s, he's known as the "Gentleman Caller."
They've been on to him for over a year.
And what I realized last night was that his abductions, they followed the ones here by about 10 days to two weeks.
Matter of fact, it was exactly 10 days after Naomi disappeared that a pretty, black coed disappeared from UCLA.
- So he's doing it there, too.
- Compulsively.
And if he follows true to form, he's due to hit California pretty quick.
Can the FBI pick him up?
If I get Rudolph to the FBI, and they make one mistake, what happens to all these girls?
I can't risk Naomi starving to death in a cell somewhere.
- No FBI.
- You're going out there on your own.
- I've got people.
- Take me with you.
I think you're best served by staying here right now.
And pretend like nothing's happened?
No, no, that's not what I was gonna say.
- I just think you should return...
- Dr Cross,
I'm the only person who's seen this guy.
I know his size, I know his voice,
I know the way he moves...
- Kate, I know how you feel. Honestly.
- Would you please stop treating me like I'm a victim?
You think I'm some kind of tourist in all this because I wasn't raped?
Every night, when I go to sleep,
I hear those women's voices.
You want to save your niece?
Well, guess what? So do I.
I don't see my cousin.
- Alex!
- There he is.
- Hey.
- Kate McTiernan.
John Sampson, DCPD, cousin, compadre extraordinaire.
- How do you do?
- Hello, Kate.
Meet Henry Castillo, LAPD.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
- Dr Cross, it is a pleasure.
- Mine, Henry.
Alex, can we huddle?
- Excuse me, Kate.
- Yeah.
Well, this is a surprise.
Time was surprises made you giddy, John.
What's the matter?
Look, we're out on a limb here.
Now, I've pulled every string.
I've called in 10 years of favours to get those cars and equipment.
This thing has got to go as smooth as silk, or we are both fucked.
Understood.
I've got him, 10:48 a.m., crossing the north window.
Attention. Rudolph just walked past the window.
Thank you for the update.
It's him. He's on the move.
This does not look like a 7-Eleven run.
Where does this road go?
Vancouver.
He sounded so sincere.
- How's that?
- When he told me that he loved me.
- I expect that's because he does.
- Please!
Multiply your anger by about a hundred, Kate.
That's how much he thinks he loves you.
Okay. Rudolph has landed.
There's a cabin about a half mile in.
So he hasn't traveled that far, after all.
He's back in the woods.
First time in California?
- It's a pretty state, ain't it?
- It's unforgettable.
What do you want?
Go ahead. What?
I can't hear you! They'll kill me!
No! Shut up! Because you're sick!
What the fuck is he doing?
- He's in a rage.
- He's going fucking nuts.
He is about to scare the wildlife out of this forest.
That's what she's saying.
Let's go. Let's fucking go. Come on.
Tell me, what did you see back there?
A killer getting organized.
Guys, he's not gonna be abducting somebody from this place.
The word is this guy's pulled people out of these joints before.
Not in the Triangle.
We'll cover him loose, see what he's got. Henry, you stay here.
If it's so crowded, how come I can't come?
- If he even thinks he sees you, it's over.
- What about you?
Twenty years of experience blending in.
You stay with Henry.
There he is. Across the bar.
Damn. He's in there just like that.
Mr Lover-Lover.
We ought to nail his ass right now.
Never been the same without Fernando.
I can't believe those guys let him go.
Unbelievable, man.
He had this knuckleball, it was like a floater, then bam.
Right off the table, couldn't even come near it. You're kidding yourself.
What do you got down there?
The Durham Bulls?
Ranked Triple-A? Got any prospects?
- EDF 40, full military specs.
- I'm going to go in.
What? Hey, hold on!
Come here. Come here, you.
- I've got to pee.
- No, you don't, okay? I'm not that stupid.
Henry, it's not really your style.
You don't know what my style is, all right?
Your style is to help me blend in.
Henry, help me blend in. Come on.
All right.
Right here, right here, right here.
Okay, I am going to walk over and find our boys, all right?
You shall stay right here.
You won't move. Wonderful.
Hey.
Kate.
Is that him? Is that Rudolph?
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.
- It's him.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Okay.
Stand still.
Follow the tree line to the drive.
Henry, you break left.
You and I, we'll take the front.
Now, guys, remember, when it goes down,
I need this guy intact.
Alex.
Be careful.
No! No! No!
No!
Go.
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay.
Oh, shit. Henry. He's hit.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Take it easy.
Hold it! Hold it!
Put your hands where I can see them.
Get out of the truck!
Get out of the truck!
Yeah, roger, here.
We're ready to transport.
How is he?
I'm sorry, Sam. For all this, I'm sorry.
Yes, "shocking" is an accurate way to describe what went on here in the early morning hours.
Local police won't comment, but Channel 6 sources tell us that what happened here in the pre-dawn hours...
- Does this hurt?
- Reaches beyond southern California, and some say, involves a rogue branch of the FBI...
They sure can document a fuck-up at the speed of light.
Here's what we know.
Well, I guarantee you won't be seeing a picture of that woman whose life you saved on TV.
Okay, breathe in. How's this?
A little tender there.
Lying critically wounded, shot twice...
What about here?
Police also found an unidentified...
- We need X-rays.
- Not a chance.
Detective Castillo and the woman were rushed to a nearby emergency facility where their condition...
Gone in the night.
At least now the FBI know who they're looking for.
- How far can he run?
- It's not a question of how far.
It's how long.
Asking lots of questions and receiving very few answers.
Questioned on the scene,
Detective John Sampson, whom we've learned is about 3,000 miles
- out of his jurisdiction.
- So, what do you want to do?
Sampson is a detective in good standing with the Washington DC
Police Department.
From what local police tell us,
Sampson was part of a ragtag surveillance team.
Sampson, Detective Castillo and two other unidentified individuals were on a stakeout, but staking out whom or what?
Property records indicate the cabin owner is Dr William...
Hi, I'd like to see about making reservations from Los Angeles to Raleigh-Durham for two people for tonight.
Was Dr Rudolph, a man with no criminal record to his name...
Okay, it's the return portion...
- Hang up the phone, Kate.
- Pardon me?
Hang up the phone.
Dr McTiernan.
Welcome to our crime scene.
The sight of yellow tape and flashbulbs must be getting a little old to you by now.
- A little.
- You got here quick.
- Not quick enough, wouldn't you say?
- Now, wait a minute, Kyle.
- Let's not downplay the upside of this.
- Upside?
Yeah, the upside. We ID'd Casanova.
You got a trail.
Alex, don't even try. It's bad form.
The day you set foot in Durham...
Look, I feel like you've been screwing me around.
- Why?
- Look, I let you in.
I shared information.
What have we got? A mess, and a cop who's looking at two years of rehab.
Kyle, do you want me to say,
"I fucked up"?
All right. I fucked up.
Just don't shut me out of this.
What do you see?
- Maybe I'm looking too hard.
- For what?
I don't know.
It seems so cold.
Not like him.
Alex.
Keep looking.
Thought the closet looked a little tight, so I brought in a DX fluoroscope.
It scanned what appeared to be a lunar module.
It's a freezer.
Trophy case.
Guy's got divergent MOs.
He's Don Juan on the east coast,
Josef Mengele on the west.
- We found feet.
- What?
You heard me. Surgically band-sawed at the ankle, vacuum-bagged.
Fifteen pair, two lefts.
Go figure. Obviously not a dancer.
Check out the shrine.
Gentleman Caller.
Casanova.
And there hasn't been a multi-territorial predator since Jean De Salle, 1921, eviscerating Paris prostitutes and strangling widows on the Riviera.
And running a bicoastal operation?
Man, this is the most ambitious stunt in the annals of serial pathology.
This guy is Houdini squared.
Put on brakes, now.
We're not dealing with Houdini here.
What we have here is
Leopold and Loeb.
Home team. Visitors.
We've got 30 ampoules of Sistol here.
The chronologies match.
There are two of them, and they're collaborating.
Collaborating and competing.
Got an ID on him?
He's probably just some kid
Rudolph did 20 years ago.
We'll comb through missing persons.
- We'll find him there.
- Don't bother.
You know who he is?
And he's got both his feet.
I'm giving you three minutes to throw that bolt.
Am I wasting my time?
Okay, boys. Nobody home.
You all take upstairs now.
Be clean, boys. Clean and thorough.
Keep the goddamn media out.
Nick, you got the Chief there?
Alex.
How long has he been in the box?
Five, six hours. They took him in the middle of a class lecture...
- This is bullshit, Kyle. This is bullshit!
- You know I wouldn't sanction this.
Look, Hatfield got the tip.
I don't know how.
Stages a huge public arrest.
By the time I'm on the ground, he's already got this guy...
You guys call in $2 million worth of surveillance equipment and these clowns stage a cold arrest?
That is top-notch police work.
Top-notch.
Alex, this is all politics.
- It's all bad, Kyle.
- Alex, not all.
Dr Sachs.
It's good to see you again, circumstances notwithstanding.
Can I... Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Soda?
Oh, come on, Wick.
There are some questions you can answer without a lawyer.
For instance, you might have said,
"Yes, thank you, I will have coffee," or, "No, thank you."
You know, just to be polite.
You don't drink coffee, do you?
You probably stick to bottled water.
What the hell is he doing?
That's how you stay in fighting trim.
He is doing what he does.
Where does the best bottled water in the world come from?
The Alps? Some French aquifer?
- Futokan.
- I'm sorry?
Futokan. It's Japanese.
You wouldn't know it.
It's in the Japanese character to do this sort of thing.
They build these special ships and sail them to the farthest navigable extremes, and look for the bluest iceberg they can find.
And they tow it back.
And one is able to drink something that was last in liquid form about 30,000 years ago.
Expensively clean.
What does it taste like?
Like water.
By the by, Alex. Writing a bestseller?
- You must be a millionaire.
- No, no. Far from it.
I bring it up only because I mean to sue you along with these other local imbeciles.
For what? Defamation of character?
I like to fuck, variously fuck, young women.
I have fucked nearly
100 of them in 75 ways, but I have never hurt any of them.
There is no record of violence anywhere in my past.
Megan Murphy.
Oh, yeah. This is a painstaking recreation of an image from Friedrich Thelen's Die Welt der Flagellanten. Do you know it?
That took me three hours to tie her up properly.
And consensually, by the way.
Dr Cross, tell me you've got more than this.
I have pictures of Megan tied to a tree.
No. I was thinking we'd discuss that at the trial in, say, six months?
But maybe you would like me to go on record now about Naomi.
Let's start with the first time I saw her.
In my office.
She was wearing a silk blouse, which pleases me because I like to turn up the air conditioning to constrict the capillaries.
You know, tweak the nipples.
You should have seen how self-conscious she was.
How nervous the chill in the air made her.
And like the others, her manner belied her real predilections.
Which reminds me, Doctor, have you seen the photographs of Naomi?
Alex! Alex!
Back up! Back up! Move! Move!
Put your hands down! All right.
Settle down, settle down. All right?
Everything's all right.
Naomi. Well, you're just as pretty as your picture.
Beautiful feet.
What do you hear? Dogs?
...hear the river?
No.
I hear him whispering.
What does he say?
I can feel his mouth on my ear.
I take it we didn't get our confession.
We didn't. He's not Casanova.
His picture was on the wall.
- That's part of their thing.
- But his picture.
Kate, it's a setup.
Brothers-in-arms watching each other's backs.
Wick Sachs is the perfect patsy for them.
He's too smug and too vain to even know what hit him.
He's just a bush-league letch.
The cops think they got the right guy.
- I've been listening to the tape.
- Yeah?
Have you ever heard a foetal sonogram? An ultrasound?
You know, on the tape, you asked me if I heard anything.
Yeah. You said, "Nothing."
That's not true.
I heard something.
It was in the background.
It was constant.
- I heard water.
- Water?
Everywhere. Below me, above, around, everywhere.
I had to have been in a basement.
Not possible.
Every farmhouse, barn, outhouse, chicken house, doghouse...
- The FBI have checked everything...
- They missed it.
Kate, I saw the aerial photographs.
They didn't miss an inch.
There were doors, there were walls, there were stairs.
It was man-made. It was built.
When you escaped, you had no recollection of a house.
You said there was light. That's it.
"Suddenly there was light."
And I had been in a house, Alex.
I am sure of it.
Okay. Here's what we're looking for, a plantation layout.
So now, there weren't plantations on the Wykagyl.
- There was a plantation.
- What?
Check it out.
All this is Mason's property.
All right, now, this is hundreds of acres.
Here's the big house, slave quarters, stables, cellars for stashing food, ice,
- tunnels everywhere.
- Can I see this?
- The river runs right through it.
- Where was I found?
Around here.
Two miles down from the big house.
Okay.
I figure that's about 1,000 yards, right?
Forget here, forget here. This square.
That's where we concentrate.
No!
Bach is crisp. Crisp.
This is quite a collection you've assembled here.
Your palette is so multicultural.
That's very PC, I applaud you.
But this place is a little overdone, don't you think?
I mean subterranean Gothic went out a while ago, didn't it?
You ought to get yourself a maid.
You know what this shit is?
This is Civil War bat guano.
It's full of fungus.
Inhale enough of this stuff, you'll have a prostate like a 70-year-old.
What about you girls? Any complaints?
Any muscle aches? Lesions? Malaise?
Come on. Don't you think they'd be better off in a freezer?
- You know this is off-limits.
- Nobody tracked me.
Of course, just like your cabin in the woods, right?
I'm not the one who made all the phone calls.
I wasn't posting fucking photographs on the Web.
That's not how they found you, Will, or they would have found me.
- You don't belong here.
- If you're here, I'm here.
I need you to help me.
- I only want what I gave you.
- You gave me nothing.
Remember '75?
Roe Tierney, homecoming queen.
Blood on the walls.
I cleaned up your slop. I always do.
Face it, Will, I'm your mentor.
- And you're the bad seed.
- Let me tell you something, my friend.
No matter how far out there you go, no matter how you dress up, when you come back, you're still just like me.
Naomi, let's hear something triumphal.
Something worthy of rebirth!
Play something for us.
- Play!
- No!
- She plays for me.
- She only plays for you?
Well, of course she does!
Because you are the great lover!
The dark figure of her dreams.
Come on, darling.
Tell him.
Tell him how grateful you are, tell him how you always wanted to be his.
Go on, tell him.
Tell him how you wait for him.
Tell him how he is the most sensitive, the best you've ever had.
Tell him that you love him.
That's what he wants to hear.
I could have aimed two inches to the left.
Don't forget who we are and who you'll be if I'm gone.
You can have a hundred women here, but without me, you'd still be alone.
Take the stairs.
Go on! Go!
Police! Freeze!
Hold it!
- Naomi?
- Alex?
- I'll be back.
- No, don't go.
I'll be back.
- Alex!
- I found them! Up the hill!
William, who is he? Tell me his name.
He's too good. You won't...
I'm waiting for the good news.
It keeps getting better and better.
Come on.
This is Casanova's next crop, blueprinted to a tee.
And we're in luck.
He didn't wear gloves.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I want all this stuff to Quantico now.
If you can't find a plane, buy one.
- Dr Cross, the man you shot...
- Sex life in LA, can you... is a Dr Rudolph of Los Angeles.
How did Casanova escape without a trace?
You got company.
- Good to see you, Seth.
- Thank you.
- Hey, you.
- Hi.
You okay?
Got something for you.
Ta-da!
What happened to the strings?
New strings for new music.
Thank you.
When is her mom coming down?
- In the morning.
- When are you heading out?
The Bureau thinks they'll have
Casanova ID'd within 12 hours, which really means 24.
As soon as Kyle gets a bead on him though, he's done, no matter how much road he's burned.
After that, I'm out of here.
So then, that's it.
I only have you for another day.
All right. Supper at my house tonight.
Home-cooked.
I promised Naomi I'd meet her at 8:30.
I'll make a lousy date.
Fine, do whatever you gotta do.
Be at my house by 7:00.
You'll be gone by 8: 15.
Hey.
If you would just verify and sign there.
Nineteen shots fired, and one W. Rudolph, room temperature.
- Good luck to you, Alex.
- You, too. Take care of yourself.
As you already know, the hostages are now safe, and are being cared for at Carolina Regional Medical.
As for the forensics team, they include our very best.
Specialists in latent prints, fiber and hair study, serology and DNA analysis.
I'm very encouraged by their progress.
In less than two hours, over...
Yeah, it feels... It feels really good.
It's not exactly normal.
I think that'll take some time.
It's different, but it's nice.
It's like getting acquainted with an old friend.
Are those rottweilers of yours out there on the case?
Well, I'm tempted to yank your chain, but they're out there, standing post.
Is that what you call it?
Yeah. Thanks for indulging me.
I'll see you soon.
Okay. Bye.
Well, look who's here.
- Hi, Detective.
- Hi. Sorry to bother you.
I brought this from the property clerk.
I'm sorry. Would you like to come in for a minute?
- May I get you something to drink?
- No, thanks.
The next shift won't be here for an hour or so, so...
I really ought to wait for them out here.
Excuse me for just a minute.
Don't go, okay?
Hello? Hi, Jen.
Son of a bitch!
Quit hovering. Come on in.
No, I'm not talking to you.
I've got company. Can I call you back?
Bye.
How do you feel about Indian food?
Oh, please.
I don't want you to trouble yourself.
I could use some help cooking, and I have enough food for an army.
Would you like a glass of wine?
No, thank you. I'm on duty.
Your first chore is to slice mushrooms.
Can you do that?
- I believe I can do that.
- If you don't mind, rinse them first.
Come on.
You should use a colander.
That way'll take forever.
It's down on the...
Oh, shit!
How are you feeling by the way?
You feel like you're getting back on your feet?
I guess if I felt solid anywhere, it should be in this house.
I've been in it one way or another my whole life. It was my great aunt's.
But I don't know. It's just different now.
Something's off.
I used to walk in the middle of the night down to the corner market for a quart of milk.
It's true. I mean, people just get complacent. It happens.
Would you please hand me the big chopping knife?
The department gives courses on self-defense.
I've already been thinking about spending more time at the dojo.
Kickboxing's fine, Kate.
But that's not what I mean.
I'm talking prevention.
We teach things like varying your routine, keeping your lights on at night, maybe getting a dog.
I'm sorry, does this bother you?
It's good. I need to hear it.
Just simple things like carrying personal alarms, taking your garbage out the morning of, and not using cordless phones.
You know, anyone with a scanner can listen in.
What does taking your garbage out the morning of have to do with anything?
Well, the night before, anyone can tear through it.
Who in the world could possibly care how much tuna I eat?
Would you rinse this off for me, please?
Think about it. A guy could come by, say, Tuesday night,
3:00 in the morning, dump your trash in one of those 30-gallon plastic sacks, haul it down to an abandoned lot and bingo.
- There it is.
- Thank you.
What a lady eats, how often she shaves.
You can even tell a lady's time of the month.
Anything you want to know.
What kind of lipstick she wears...
And used condoms.
How often is she getting it?
Twice a week? Three times?
The same guy? Different guys?
Of course, that doesn't apply to you.
Let's face it. In your case, it's been quite a while, hasn't it?
Not since that surgeon, what, six, seven months ago?
You were special, Kate. Do you have any idea how much time I gave you?
Months. Yes, months.
I sacrificed for you.
But now I'm going to show you sacrifice.
What are you going to do?
You gonna cut me?
Do it!
Good girl.
Now I'll show you.
Don't do it, Nick.
Let's talk about it, okay?
You wanna put the lighter down, Nick? Please?
She has to know.
She knows, Nick.
Then why don't you shoot me?
I don't think so. Muzzle flare.
Room full of gas, all that, you know?
Look, Nick.
I'm going to put the gun down.
Look. See?
There, now. How's that?
I want you to think about this, Nick.
If you do this, no one will ever understand.
- Don't mindfuck me!
- No, no, I'm not, Nick. I'm not.
You see, Kate?
It's all about building rapport.
You use the subject's first name.
And your tone.
You've got to keep it soft and steady.
- Establish eye contact. Seek his level.
- You want to know the truth, Alex?
- You're the one who really needs help.
- Well, enlighten me, Nick.
Tell me what truth is.
Truth is looking at a beautiful woman like our Kate here, and saying to yourself,
"I've got to have that."
"I've got to break her down."
It's your basest animal self.
Dig deep, Alex. You'll recognize him.
He's ugly.
I've run into him now and then.
Go ahead.
Reach for the Glock and take me down before I tell you about the 10 days
I spent with Naomi.
Ten days, Doc.
Things she'd never tell you.
My brown sugar. Face like an angel.
Perfect. Every inch of her.
You never knew Naomi. Not like I did.
Deep down, you envy me that.
Say it.
I don't work like you.
I don't hate.
You only wish you had the courage.
Good night, sweet Kate.
Kate.
It's all right, Kate.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Can I check your hats, please?
Gentlemen?
Gentlemen.
Got caught like a bear trap.
You want to play or do you want to pay? I got a great girl.
Jack Flynn?
Here you go, buddy.
Buy yourself a good time.
- They'll let anybody in here.
- Mr. Flynn, I'm Maxwell Hoover.
I'm with the Los Angeles
Police Department.
That means I get change back.
Are you still here?
What is it gonna cost me?
I came here to deliver a message.
Your presence is required back in Chicago.
It's cold in Chicago, which is why I came out here.
Is Mr. Flynn being charged with a crime?
What are you, his lawyer?
No, but I'm represented by a good one.
What's my friend being charged with?
He did things in Chicago.
I beat all that, pal.
I beat those indictments.
Jimmy, hit him in the nuts!
Let's go. Get him outta here.
You guys are making a big mistake.
Where are we going?
The airport.
You're going to the airport, Jack.
You gotta get back to Chicago as soon as possible.
This ain't the way to the airport.
This is it.
Yeah. This is it.
This is what?
This is Mulholland Falls, Jack.
Mulholland Falls?
It's kind of like Niagara Falls.
Come on! There ain't no falls in L.A.
You guys can't do this.
This is America.
This isn't America, Jack.
This is L.A.
I thought we weren't gonna do this anymore.
- Do what?
- This.
Come on, let's go.
Jack?
Maybe he's dead.
He's not dead, he's looking right at us.
Jack, are you dead?
He's alive.
Now, Jack, we don't have organized crime in L.A., and frankly, we don't want organized crime.
So here's what I want you to do.
I want you to look around and remember this because this will always be your way back to Chicago.
Mulholland Falls.
Lee.
Now, that's a thought.
- Hey, Max.
- Kate.
- Lili.
- Hi.
We were just discussing husbands.
I'm trying to find a new one for Lili.
- Do you know any?
- Jeez, Lili.
Only guys I know are cops and bad guys.
Thanks, Pete.
And I don't know if I can recommend either one.
How about Eddie Hall?
- Eddie Hall?
- Yeah.
Eddie Hall. No.
He's been married five times.
- You see what I mean?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry I was late, Kate, but we had a little accident up in the hills.
No, no, no, Kate.
You know I got two flat feet.
Come on.
Excuse us, Lili.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
- You the foreman?
- Yeah.
Where are we out here? What is this?
We're in a new housing subdivision.
You ever think about who those people are that are gonna live way out here?
No.
Me, neither.
All right, guys,
I'll take it from here.
- No pictures till I tell ya.
- Whatever you say.
Hey, Doc.
Max, I should've stayed in bed.
Are you in charge of this operation?
Yeah, this part I am.
You got any heavy equipment around here that could press a woman into the ground like that?
A big roller maybe.
Seems like that would've chewed her up more.
- Is this the way you found her?
- Yeah. We didn't touch it.
Yeah, she was just like this.
Why don't you step over there, an officer will take your full statement.
Jesus, Milt.
There's nothing to hold on to.
Okay, roll her over and see what she looks like.
Jesus.
- You okay, Max?
- Yeah.
Step aside, boys.
Let me get a couple.
Jeez, what a mess.
- Check under her fingernails.
- Okay.
How'd she die?
It's like she jumped off a cliff.
There's no cliff out there.
Somebody moved her?
She wasn't moved.
She died just where you found her.
Doc, did you see this?
What is it?
Looks like glass.
"A Farewell to Arms."
"By Ernest Hemingway."
You know the way this guy writes, he never talked to a woman in his life.
When did you ever read Hemingway?
He thinks they all want to be called "my darling."
And what they really want is?
What they really want is a man that'll listen to their stomachs.
Max, don't drool on me.
- Come on.
- What's the matter?
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
Tell me.
We found a dead girl in the Valley.
She was broken into 30 pieces.
Couldn't even pick her up.
Who is she?
Nobody.
Just a girl.
Just a girl.
I'm sorry, Kate.
Can you believe that?
The D.A. won't indict Kroyle.
What's wrong with this country?
A guy chops up his parents with an axe and doesn't get the gas chamber?
How can you plea bargain something like that?
His fingerprints are all over the murder weapon.
That places him at the scene of the crime.
They won't indict.
It doesn't make any difference.
I knew that D.A. when he was a bagman for Jack Draga.
No kiddin'. How'd he become a D.A. then, for Christ' sake?
D.A.'s an elected office.
Any scumbag can get in if they got enough votes.
Ellery, how come you got a hot dog in your mouth while you're threading a projector?
Why do you eat while you're working?
Why do you eat all the time?
It's all psychological, Max.
I eat so I don't think about food.
So you eat so you don't think about food?
Yeah.
Ellery, I don't want to butt into your business, but this psychiatrist, the guy you're going to,
I think he's in worse shape than you are.
She, Max. It's a woman.
Dammit, I can't get my finger in there! It won't fit!
Try your dick.
Esther, please.
Here, try this.
So you're going to her about food?
Yeah.
I thought you were going to her about the other thing.
- My temper?
- Yeah.
It's all related, Max.
The eating and the anger, they come from the same place.
The food calms me down.
Esther, don't you have something better to do?
No. Not better than this.
All right.
- Ready?
- Yeah. Turn it on.
What is this, somebody's summer vacation?
That's the girl we found in the Valley, Max.
Max, I gotta talk to you about this D.A.
He's a prick. Max?
Coolidge, do me a favor.
You go get yourself something to eat.
Go back to your desk.
Max, if something is wrong...
I mean, maybe it's best to talk it out, you know, and get it out in the open, if it's anything like that.
No, nothing like that.
But any problem could be solved, Max.
All you have to do is break it down into parts, you see?
It's just simple, it's right into parts, my psychiatrist told me, and you deal with each part individually.
One part, and then you go to the next part.
You just gotta break it down, but the first...
Ellery.
Do me that favor.
Just do it.
Hoover!
You alone?
Yeah.
- I need protection.
- From what?
You look at the film I sent you?
You know who the guy in it is?
I don't even know who you are.
I'm Jimmy Fields.
Look, that guy in the movie, he killed her!
Killed who?
Spare me the crap,
I don't have time for it!
A mutual friend is dead, they killed her, and I'm going out the same way unless I can get some help.
How do you know she's dead?
Because she would've called me otherwise.
Because she always called me, always, always.
Because I was her best friend.
That means I didn't fuck her.
What did you do with her, share makeup tips?
Do I make you nervous, Lieutenant?
When was the last time you saw her?
Saturday.
In Vegas.
She dropped my camera off Saturday morning, said she'd meet me back in L.A., that her and the general were gonna go for a little ride.
What general?
Cops.
Does Thomas Timms ring a bell?
You go look it up.
How many more films are there?
Couple.
Did she know?
Maybe.
I asked you a question.
Did she know you were taking movies?
No.
I'd put that gun away.
Help me, Hoover.
You're supposed to be a cop!
I thought you couldn't turn anybody down.
Is that what she said?
That's what she said.
She was wrong.
I had him by the neck when he swore at me.
Here he comes.
Where are we going, Max?
I got something to take care of.
I'll be back later.
We gotta ask you a question.
The dead girl, she's the same one that's in the movie, isn't she?
Coolidge tell you that?
I've been worried, Max.
Worried? You're worried?
What the hell you worried about?
We're partners here.
Tell us, was something going on between you and that dead girl?
Look, guys, I want you to cut me a little slack on this one.
Just let me do what I gotta do.
I thought you had grand jury testimony today.
To hell with the grand jury, Max.
So where are we going?
You know, I've been thinking, why is it we always sit in the same places?
And why is it you're always the one that drives, Max?
I guess it's 'cause I got the keys.
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
Why is it you always have the keys?
There's reasons for everything, right?
Ellery, I would never attempt to criticize the inner workings of the human mind.
Are you still seeing that psychiatrist?
There's nothing wrong with my psychiatrist.
We just want to know how much longer.
I don't know, it's open-ended.
Oh, Jesus, God.
Why is it you have the keys, Max?
- Max.
- Yeah.
Let Ellery drive.
Are you happy, Coolidge?
Yup.
Take it out of low.
Oh, jeez!
Sorry, Max.
That's why he usually has the keys.
Relyea, go talk to the manager, tell him we're going through a room.
Right.
Manager says some guy in 23, a Jimmy Fields, is her best friend.
Hasn't seen either one of them in over a week.
He's not very neat, is he?
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
- You all right, Max?
- Yeah.
For a minute there,
I just couldn't breathe.
I couldn't stay in there.
- Want a cigarette?
- Yeah.
How long were you seeing her?
Six months.
Every chance I got.
Here?
Yeah, here.
Jesus Christ.
That guy's got film on you and everything, doesn't he?
You remember Kenny Kamins?
- Can I help you, gentlemen?
- We're looking for Kenny Kamins.
- Have you seen him?
- Never heard of him.
He never heard of him.
You believe that, fellas?
What are you guys doing here?
You got a fucking warrant?
You sound like you're from New York.
- So what?
- I'm from Jersey.
What's going on? What do you think you're doing, Kenny?
Relax, Allison. Jenny and I were just having a party.
Go do something useful.
Go powder your nose.
You're sick, Kenny. This is sick!
I'm not gonna let you do this to her. She's a child.
So were you once, doll.
Look at what a woman you became.
No, Kenny.
Are you nuts?
Nice one. That was a good shot.
Come here.
You pull that shit again, and I'm gonna break your little neck.
All right?
Hello, Kenny.
This is a private party, Hoover.
- You got a warrant?
- I got this.
Remember this, Kenny?
Kenny, Kenny, what are you doing?
- Get her out of here.
- Let's go.
You broke my fingers!
What do you say, Kenny, we have a little party?
I don't do that stuff.
- You don't want to see this.
- Yes, I do.
Jesus Christ, Allison, call the cops!
I am the cops, Kenny.
Inventive way of dispensing justice.
It's an integral part of the job.
You were more effective than I was.
So, who are you?
You won't find out by killing me.
Why did you fall for her, Max?
What did Katherine say?
You told her, didn't you?
- The guy with the camera, he's a fruit?
- Right.
Not shaking you down, is he?
Could be, he's running scared.
Maybe we should pay him a visit.
I thought we weren't gonna do that anymore. We agreed.
Did you guys ever hear of a general named Thomas Timms?
Yeah.
He's one of the inventors of the A-bomb.
They made him Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
I got seven minutes of film with him with Allison.
You got trouble.
Let's talk to the fruit.
All right, let's go over it again.
What did she say?
She said that she was going for a ride with Timms.
Out to where they test those things.
And she wasn't scared?
No, she wasn't scared.
She was never scared.
Except of being alone.
Come on, Jimmy, sit down.
What'd you make the films for, Jimmy?
What'd you make the films for?
Why were you in it?
What was it? Blackmail?
I thought about that.
You know, for a rainy...
Why'd you make 'em?
- That was nice.
- What's wrong with Max?
- I don't know.
- What's the matter with him?
Why'd you make 'em, Jimmy?
Because it made me feel a part of it.
You know, watch the boys get impassioned.
You made films of me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Where are those films?
That's the question, isn't it?
When she didn't show up,
I went back to my apartment, but the place was torn apart.
They'd taken them all.
Except for the one I sent you.
That was still at the lab.
You know, Jimmy, none of that proves Timms' guilt.
What, do you need a roadmap?
Timms knew about the film.
He's the last to see her alive.
She's dead. They killed her up there.
She didn't die in the desert, she died here.
Right outside of L.A.
You told me yourself that Allison didn't know about the films, so Timms couldn't have known about it either.
Why would a guy kill his girl over a film he didn't even know existed?
You were the last to see her alive.
How do I know you didn't kill her?
Because I loved her and she was my best friend.
She nearly died when you left, did you know that?
She loved you, and you just used her.
How does that feel?
You know, you sit there like you're protecting the innocent.
All you really do is just beat up on the weak and disregard or destroy anybody or anything that stands in the way of you and your pathetic little sense of right or wrong or justice and power.
If anybody is responsible for Allison's death it's you.
You son of a bitch!
Shit! Come on, Eddie.
Come on, he's gonna kill me!
Come on!
- Get him out of here!
- It ain't worth it.
You don't realize.
Just get him out of here!
Come on, Fields, let's go. Move it.
Max, everybody has weak moments.
You gotta get it out,
- you gotta tell Kathy.
- Shut up! Shut the hell up!
Jesus Christ, is that what your psychiatrist told you?
Let me tell you how it goes, Ellery.
You meet somebody.
Maybe they're a little off center, but they tell you the truth.
And you like them for that, and one thing leads to another, and you end up in bed.
- Now, that's weak.
- Max...
But, now, listen to me.
Nobody gets hurt.
You go home, and you see your wife, and you're feeling bad.
You want to unload it, you want to get it off your chest.
So you tell her, and now she's hurt.
Now, that's weak, too, Ellery.
But it's also cruel.
It's just goddamn cruel.
Here's something for you.
Here's something that doesn't cost you 25 bucks an hour.
You carry your own water, Ellery.
You understand?
Carry your own water.
Max, I was just trying to help. I'm sorry.
No, forget it.
It's all right.
We're still partners, right?
Yeah. Partners.
Thanks, Ell.
Go help them, will you?
- You okay, Max?
- Yeah.
Come here.
I don't understand how anybody can live at the beach.
Those waves crashing and flopping all the time drive me crazy.
I'm with you, Eddie. I like the sound of traffic when I'm sleeping.
I find it very peaceful.
Most people do.
I guess cops are just different.
Don't push your luck there, Fields.
The only reason we're here is because of Max.
If I had it my way,
I'd rather dump you out of a speeding car.
See if you'd bounce around a little.
Hey, Earl!
How's that chili comin'?
It's done.
As my Aunt Mabel used to say, presentation is everything.
I think you and Coolidge ought to open up an automat.
The look is connected to the way it tastes.
Stay down!
It stopped.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Where's Fields?
- I'll get him back.
- Right.
Fields!
Shit!
That's it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so.
You see 'em take Fields?
I couldn't see shit, Max.
They shot the hell out of this place.
Must've had a heavy machine gun.
Fruitcake disappeared.
Lieutenant? They want you down at the beach.
We see around the head there...
- Jesus Christ.
- How'd they kill him, doc?
What can I tell you?
They stuck a gun in his mouth
- and blew the back of his head off.
- An execution?
Not until they asked him some questions first.
Contusions, abrasions, ecchymosis around the neck.
Right.
Come on, I want to show you guys something.
We took these x-rays of Allison Pond.
Look what happened.
Yeah, this foot's got a heel.
This one doesn't.
Why is it all blurry?
Gamma rays fog the film.
That glass in her foot, it's radioactive.
Yes, sir?
LAPD. I'm here to see General Timms.
Hey, give me that.
Five to one we don't get in.
This is the Army.
I say we try the back way.
Five to one... I take those odds.
- You'll take it?
- Yeah.
Five to one?
- Here's my five.
- Here, you hold the money.
Make sure he knows that.
Sorry, sir. No civilian admittance, no exceptions.
Did you talk to General Timms?
The General's unavailable, sir.
Did you tell him it was police business?
Yes, sir. They said no civilian admittance, no exceptions.
You lose, Coolidge.
You know, you could've talked to him a little more, Max.
You owe me a buck.
Wait, wait, wait.
Amateur hour.
Seen too many movies, Relyea.
Shit.
- Come on, it's hot.
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
Let me try.
All right.
You know, when I was a kid, I thought everybody in Hollywood had a horse.
Because every movie I saw was a cowboy movie.
You remember those movies, right?
They would come galloping into town, the cowboys would get off the horse, dust all over the place.
They get the reins and wrap it around the railing once, twice, three times, keep on wrapping it, but Gene Autry?
Let me tell you something.
Gene Autry would come into town, jump off the horse, and carefully wrap the reins around once, just once.
Then he would go inside and see the sheriff.
Boy, did I worry about that horse getting away.
I did.
What the hell is that?
This place is weird.
Jesus, what a big hole.
We just dropped the damn thing right here?
Yup. That's what happens when they set one off at ground level.
What happened to all the dirt?
Vaporized, along with everything else.
We got company.
- Guess it's time to go, huh?
- Yeah.
Step on it.
Put your hands in the air or you will be shot!
They're clean, sir.
You men are in violation of federal law.
I could have you all shot.
Do you have some identification?
There you go.
Put your hands down, gentlemen.
"Lieutenant Hoover."
Los Angeles Police Department.
We're investigating a homicide, sir.
You're way out of your jurisdiction, Lieutenant.
I'm going to assume that you are aware of the penalties for trespassing a federally restricted area.
And for destruction of government property.
We go where the case takes us.
Not if it takes you here you don't.
Out here it's military law.
And I'm in charge of enforcing it.
Captain?
Escort these gentlemen back to the base and lock them up.
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel, sir?
Yes, sir.
On the perimeter, sir, but they'd violated security...
I don't think that's a good idea, sir.
Well, I don't think that's a good idea, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Put that one in the jeep.
The rest of them can wait at the base.
- Sergeant!
- Miller, Resnick!
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
If I see this vehicle in a restricted area again,
I'll burn it... And everyone in it.
Lieutenant.
Wait here.
Hoover, Truman...
Is that the general?
All bombs.
- What are those?
- Ships.
Lieutenant Hoover, I'm General Timms.
What can I do for the Los Angeles
Police Department today?
I came to talk about Allison Pond.
Yes, I know.
Colonel Fitzgerald informed me.
Did he also mention the condition in which Miss Pond was found?
Yes, he did.
Excuse me for not wanting to stand, but I've had a horse accident.
I pinched a sciatic nerve.
Have you ever had back troubles, Lieutenant?
I got shot there once.
I'm going to cut through formalities, Lieutenant.
You are aware that Miss Pond and I had a certain relationship, and I believe you're also aware that she had similar relationships with other men.
I believe Miss Pond was in your company from Friday through the weekend.
That sounds about right.
We went to Tahoe on Saturday.
Senator Bolton has a house there that he lends us for the weekend from time to time.
So you were in Tahoe, not here?
Friday night here, then Tahoe on Saturday, and Sunday night,
I flew to Washington.
She wasn't out at the test site?
That's restricted.
But then you know that, don't you?
She went down to Los Angeles
Saturday, Lieutenant, and I went on for a meeting with the Secretary of Defense.
Do you think much about national security, Lieutenant?
Well, I got all the security I can handle right now in L.A., General.
Do you know much about atomic energy, what it means?
Ended the war.
Did you know that the atom itself is mostly empty space?
I never really thought about it, General.
Almost completely empty, but with tiny fragments of matter.
And since this entire universe is made up of atoms, everything that we see and touch...
In fact, the very floor beneath us is made up of almost completely empty space.
The only reason we don't fall through it is because these tiny particles of matter are just whirling about at such speed that they give us the illusion of solidity.
Actually, the floor is spinning right underneath our feet.
Do you feel it, Lieutenant?
Then we're just empty space ourselves.
Exactly, exactly.
And these tiny particles of matter, which are so small that no one's ever seen them, never, they contain enough energy to blow up this house, an entire city, every person on Earth.
That is inconceivable.
General, I really don't think much about those things.
I'd probably see too much.
What do you see?
People dead before their time.
That's the history of the world, Lieutenant.
Some people die before their time so that others can live.
It's the cornerstone of civilization.
War, religion, democracy.
A hundred die so that a thousand may live.
Well, General, I take
'em one at a time.
Right now I got Allison Pond.
We're not so different, you and I, Lieutenant.
You see, certain men...
A doctor, a national leader, an officer of the law, give to society in ways that most people do not.
In turn, society gives them certain considerations.
Now, we don't teach this in school.
We don't acknowledge it.
But those who accept the burden of leadership understand they have these considerations.
You've accepted the burden of leadership, haven't you, Lieutenant?
In what sense, General?
You protect society, the ordinary citizen.
Now, in doing so, sometimes you may break the law.
You may violate the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Search and Seizure.
In fact, it may even be known that you do so.
And yet, nothing happens, because it is understood that that is part of the burden of leadership.
And you accept it.
You accept your sins.
General, Allison Pond was out at your test site.
We found this in her foot.
I'm gonna need your calendar for the last month, where you were, who you saw.
Of course you are.
Colonel Fitzgerald will get you everything you need.
Thank you, sir.
Nice house.
I've spoken to Los Angeles.
We'll have the film within 24 hours.
What'd Timms have to say?
He said the cornerstone of civilization was human sacrifice.
Lieutenant Hoover, sir.
Maxwell.
Maxwell Hoover, say hello to
Special Agent Jeffrey McCafferty of the old FBI.
Lieutenant.
Special Agent McCafferty here seems to be interested in one of our cases.
Allison Pond.
Special Agent, that was her name, wasn't it? Allison Pond?
Yes, sir.
Bill, you mind if I inquire what business it is of the FBI's?
If I may, Chief.
Our role here is purely informational.
We are aware of the fact that a man of fundamental importance to national security has somehow been brought into an investigation in reference to a young girl's death.
In light of the damage that this could do to him both personally and in his work, the director felt that it was appropriate, without stepping on your jurisdiction, of course, for me to come down and share with you our knowledge of the situation.
And what would that be?
I'm prepared to give you the director's personal guarantee that General Timms had nothing to do with the death of Allison Pond.
How would the director know something like that?
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
That's it?
That's it?
If I call your boss in Washington, he'll vouch for this pile of crap you're handing us?
The director specifically asked me to tell you that he appreciates your cooperation in this matter, Lieutenant Hoover.
He also felt that you would understand the sensitive nature of the situation, being that you're a married man yourself.
We are not within our resources, gentlemen.
And we're more than willing to share them with you.
Of course, if you were to come across anything in regard to evidence, the director would be grateful to see it himself.
The director would be very grateful.
Maxwell...
Do you have the slightest idea how intensely I hate these pathetic little Ivy
League cops being in my town?
Let alone sitting in a chair in my office?
Yes, sir, I sure do. Yes, sir.
Have you got anything hard on this guy Timms?
He's lying about Allison Pond.
- Can you prove that?
- No, sir, I can't prove it, but I will.
But here's the deal, Bill.
We had an informant.
Now, he was killed at the beach by a heavy machine gun heavy caliber machine gun.
That's military, that's a connection.
Wait a second, I know three guys a block from Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood alone who've got the same ordnance in their back rooms.
Wake up.
Bill, when we set this squad up, we answered to nobody but you.
That was the deal, nobody but you.
Four men, no politics, no favors.
- We answered to nobody.
- No.
When we set it up, it was organized to do two things, get rid of gangsters and criminals, not go up against the
Atomic Energy Commission.
But goddamn it, Bill, what if they're killing people?
Sometimes you guys talk to people and nobody ever sees 'em again.
They become history.
Nobody looks too hard into that.
Allison Pond never hurt anybody.
She must've done something.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here talking about her like this.
I'm coming.
- Mrs. Hoover?
- Yes?
FBI. We have a warrant to search the premises, ma'am.
A warrant?
You're looking for a film?
What kind of film?
Mike, check the bookcase, please.
What kind of film?
Esther, where's Max?
Cut it.
No!
Find him!
- Are you hurt?
- No.
What happened?
The FBI was here with a search warrant, looking for a film.
What's going on?
Max, what is going on?
The man in the film is named Thomas Timms.
He's the head of the
Atomic Energy Commission.
And the girl is dead.
- That's all?
- That's all.
You know why these guys are still L.A. cops?
Because they couldn't cut the grade to make federal agents.
Wire taps, warrants, subpoenas.
You follow proper procedure, and it can't fail, boys.
J. Edgar taught me that.
This prick from the LAPD thinks he got over on me?
I fixed his ass with a search warrant on his premises.
What if Hoover comes here?
I'll arrest him for trespassing.
Jesus Christ!
See? That's federal property.
This isn't.
This is L.A.
This is my town.
Out here you're a trespasser.
Out here I could pick you up, burn your house, fuck your wife, and kill your dog.
And the only thing that'll protect you is if I can't find you and I already found you.
How long?
Six months.
A little less.
Did everybody know?
No.
No, nobody knew.
It's been over...
You Pig!
Hoover.
Fitzgerald.
You've got something of ours.
I want to see Timms.
There's no reason to involve the General in this.
It's a straight trade, yours for ours.
What you got today was a copy.
We will do whatever is necessary.
No Timms, no deal.
All right. 10:00 tomorrow at the military airfield west of the city.
You bring everything, we bring everything.
Originals and any copies.
This is where you bring people to get rid of them.
Isn't it?
It's over, right?
It's not like that, Allison.
It's not just over.
The thing is you think you can have it both ways, that you can make it work both ways.
But I can't.
I have different problems, Max.
I never wanted it both ways.
I thought you were asleep.
What are you thinking about?
I know what you think.
I just don't know how you're thinking about it.
It isn't good.
Yeah.
You want me to leave for a while?
At least.
- We got a serious problem, Max.
- What's that?
Hoover. Not you, the other Hoover.
Called the chief from
Washington 5:00 this morning.
The chief has been looking for you ever since.
Kidnapping, assault, attempted murder.
If I attempted to murder
McCafferty, he'd be dead.
Max, this is serious.
The chief is pissed!
So let him be pissed.
Max, he wants to talk to you.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Coming along.
I am not going back there telling the chief you wouldn't come.
Hall's right about that psychiatrist.
He's turning you into a piano teacher.
She. It's a woman, Max.
Where are we going, Max?
Max? Where are we going?
This is about to turn bad, isn't it, Max?
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Now, listen, Coolidge, you don't come with me.
This is personal.
Max, I'm coming.
No, no, listen to me.
This is something I gotta do.
Max, we're partners. I'm coming.
Right. Right, we're partners.
Lieutenant, we only expected one visitor.
He goes wherever I go.
We're partners.
Suit yourself.
Sergeant, search 'em for weapons.
- I don't carry a gun.
- Raise your arms, sir.
That's very impressive.
Escort them to Colonel
Fitzgerald's office.
What's that?
It's a restricted area, sir.
- Restricted?
- Yes, sir.
- Can I see it?
- Sir, that area is restricted.
I cannot take you there.
You know, Coolidge...
Take this.
Stash the car. I'll meet you later.
- Be careful.
- Yeah.
It's locked?
Locked.
Wait here, I'll go around back.
Lieutenant Hoover?
What is it?
Cancer.
It's in my blood, my bones.
Even now, they tell me, in my brain.
You've never seen anyone with terminal cancer, have you?
I saw a whole roomful of terminal cancer on my way in.
The hundred who died so that the thousand might live.
What were they, experiments?
Think of them as soldiers.
They didn't seem like soldiers to me.
That's why you killed Allison.
My God, Lieutenant.
Why would I kill Allison?
She showed me pleasures
I never dreamed existed.
It's all I think about these days.
I'm sure you understand that.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean, it was a mistake?
Her death.
An error in judgment.
An overzealous reaction against a perceived threat to national security.
She saw the cancer ward.
She took pictures.
You're much more intelligent than you appear to be, Lieutenant.
Must be a big advantage in your field.
In my field, everyone was always so desperate to seem cleverer than they were.
- What is that?
- Film.
Of you and Allison.
She was spectacular, wasn't she?
Drop the gun, Lieutenant.
What now, Colonel?
Sir, they breached security, they intended to harm you.
No, they brought me a film.
Pardon me, sir, but they've compromised top secret scientific areas.
We have a test scheduled in one hour.
I understand that perfectly, Colonel.
These men are not enemies.
Perhaps you could see to it that they are taken back to Los Angeles.
With all due respect, General, security for this particular installation...
Colonel...
Take them back now.
All right.
Sir.
The captain and I have business in Los Angeles.
We're gonna catch a ride down with you if you don't mind.
It's your plane.
- Let's take it up.
- Roger.
How come there's no door?
It's very loud.
This plane is rigged for jumping.
You won't be uncomfortable.
They're gonna throw us out of the plane, just like they did Allison Pond.
You gave us the wrong film, Lieutenant.
I'm not interested in police training films about the clap.
Everything you have for everything we have that was the understanding.
But you see, there's a problem.
- You sent the film to my house.
- That was to get your attention.
No copies were sent to the press or the Los Angeles Police Department.
You see, the problem is you sent the film to my house addressed to my wife.
And she watched it.
I don't care who sees it now.
See what I mean?
I don't have anything to lose.
Does Timms know about this?
The general's no longer relevant.
Who made the decision to throw her out of the plane?
If such a thing had happened, the general wouldn't have been informed.
He wouldn't have made that decision.
Of course not.
Would it have been you?
That's right.
If he couldn't intervene on her part, he can't intervene to save you.
No one can intervene here, Lieutenant.
They threw Allison out of the plane.
- They threw her out of the plane, Max.
- That's right.
You threw that little girl out of a plane!
You're pathetic, Hoover!
I did my job!
She died because she was in the way!
She died for nothing, you son of a bitch!
Hold on, Max.
What the hell's going on in here?
- What's happening?
- Oh, my God.
Is he all right?
He's been shot, Max.
Is he dead?
Come on, get up! Come on!
Get up! Wake up. He's alive!
You fly this plane, or I'll fucking kill you right here, you hear me?
Stay awake. We gotta land this plane now, or he's gonna die on us.
Come on. We need you to fly the plane.
- You gotta fly this plane.
- We need you to fly the plane!
Stay awake. Come on, come on.
That's it.
Oh, Jesus!
We made it, Max!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay. You all right?
I feel cold, Max.
Jesus Christ, Ellery, how can you be cold?
We're in the middle of a goddamn desert!
Max, I gotta sit.
All right, go ahead and sit down.
Hey, Max?
- What happened?
- Max, I think I'm shot.
Let me see.
- I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.
My psychiatrist is not gonna like this, Max.
I'm cold.
You know, while it was all happening in there, Max
I felt good again.
It was like it used to be.
Ellery, don't talk, save your strength.
- Save your strength.
- Why?
I like to talk, Max. You know me.
You gotta get it out, right?
Tell me the truth.
Is there something wrong with me?
Ellery, listen to me. Listen to me.
There's nothing wrong with you.
- You mean it?
- Yeah. Listen to me.
- You wouldn't lie to me, right, Max?
- No, no, no.
We're partners, right?
We're partners.
- Partners.
- Yeah.
- Right.
- That's right.
We're partners, Max.
No, come on, Ellery. Come on, come on, stay awake.
No, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Stay awake. Come on, come on.
Stay awake! Come on back!
Ellery, come on!
I hear they broke up the squad.
I broke up the squad.
There's no squad without Ellery.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
Did you ever think about leaving me for her, Max?
No, Kate. No.
Why'd you stop seeing her?
Kate, I love you.
I have always loved you.
When I realized what a mistake I had made,
I just didn't want it between us.
But... It is.
I guess it always will be.
It'll never be the same, Max.
- Let's go, Eddie.
- Let's get out of here.
You broke my heart, Max.
{3661}{3730}- My God!|- Is anything gone?
{3730}{3829}- How can I look? I'm shaking.|- I wanna know if anything's gone.
{3835}{3934}- Calm down.|- We could've been killed. The Kandinsky!
{3943}{4041}- The Kandinsky!|- It's gone! Oh, my God! Call the police!
{4047}{4125}There it is. The silver Victorian inkwell.
{4131}{4218}- How can you think about things?!|- There's the inkwell.
{4227}{4350}- We could have been murdered!|- Silver jaguar.
{4356}{4401}Why?
{4410}{4509}- Slashed. Throats slashed.|- There's the Degas.
{4515}{4629}Go to bed at night happy and then|murdered. Would we have woken up?
{4635}{4707}We're alive.
{4719}{4764}- (dog yelps)|- (both scream)
{4773}{4851}The dog, the dog, the dog. Oh, God.
{4854}{4911}- Oh, my God!|- What is it?
{4923}{4995}The wedding.|We have to go to the wedding.
{5000}{5057}- I'm in no mood to go.|- We have to.
{5063}{5123}- They're your friends.|- I beg to differ...
{5129}{5198}- Hello?!|- What?
{5210}{5315}You don't call out "hello" unless the...
{5348}{5414}I think we could tell|if someone else was here.
{5426}{5480}- We didn't all night.|- (phone rings)
{5486}{5552}Oh, God. No, don't pick that up! It's him!
{5555}{5603}Hello.
{5615}{5666}Hello.
{5699}{5747}Hello.
{5774}{5798}Hello.
{6205}{6256}Hello.
{6259}{6331}Bride's side or groom's side?
{6337}{6451}Either side. I can't even|remember how we met them.
{6460}{6520}Why are we here?
{6529}{6589}Let's not make a scene.
{6661}{6778}The most terrifying words in the world -
{6787}{6913}- "Now I lay me down to sleep..." Think.|- "Pray the Lord my soul to keep."
{6925}{7020}But then the nightmare part.|"If I should die before I wake..."
{7026}{7071}"Pray the Lord my soul to take."
{7077}{7134}- Are you OK?|- We were nearly murdered.
{7143}{7203}- Throats slashed.|- It was awful.
{7209}{7284}- You could've been killed?|- Only hours ago.
{7287}{7347}- But we're here.|- We wouldn't miss it.
{7359}{7440}Happy the bride the sun shines on.
{7449}{7524}( "Here Comes the Bride")
{7647}{7770}Chaos, control. Chaos, control.|You like? You like?
{7989}{8108}- I'll have a gin and tonic, please.|- Tell them.
{8123}{8201}We were having|a wonderful evening last night.
{8207}{8291}A friend we hadn't seen in years|came by for dinner.
{8294}{8399}- Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa.|- Don't say that so portentously.
{8411}{8525}- Geoffrey from Serth Efrica.|- Well, don't be gaga!
{8531}{8606}- Scotch, please.|- Just something large.
{8615}{8693}Geoffrey was in New York|briefly on business,
{8696}{8762}and he asked us to ask him for dinner.
{8825}{8861}Listen.
{8867}{8927}What's wrong?
{8984}{9094}It always amazes me|when New York is so quiet.
{9103}{9151}Oh! (laughs)
{9157}{9241}With the kids away,|we get used to less noise.
{9247}{9400}- Geoffrey is King-Midas rich. Gold mines.|- 70,000 workers in one gold mine alone.
{9409}{9502}But he's short of cash.|His government won't let its people...
{9508}{9589}- lts white people.|- ..take out any money.
{9598}{9649}It's like taking in a war baby.
{9655}{9790}His call was like a bolt from the blue, as|I had a deal coming up and was short by...
{9796}{9871}- Two million.|- The figure is superfluous.
{9883}{9958}I hate when you use|the word "superfluous".
{9964}{10083}I mean, he needed two million.|We hadn't seen Geoffrey in a long time.
{10092}{10194}While he might not have the price|of dinner, he might have $2,000,000.
{10200}{10293}It's the awful thing about|having truly rich friends.
{10302}{10404}Let's face it, the money does|get in the way. I'll take that one.
{10413}{10497}Having a rich friend is like drowning|and he makes lifeboats.
{10506}{10662}Only your friend gets very touchy if you|say one word - lifeboat. That is two words.
{10674}{10818}We were afraid our friend might say we|were loving him because of his lifeboat.
{10830}{10932}We weren't sucking up. We like Geoffrey.
{10944}{10986}(applause)
{10991}{11069}- Shouldn't we...?|- Not on your life.
{11078}{11165}- It was hardly a lifeboat evening.|- Portentous.
{11174}{11282}But when Geoffrey called|and asked us to take him for dinner,
{11288}{11438}he made a pattern in life's tea leaves,|because who wants to go to banks?
{11450}{11504}Why do you stay in South Africa?
{11507}{11591}One has to stay there|to educate the black workers.
{11600}{11723}We'll know we've been successful|when they kill us.
{11729}{11837}- Planning the revolution to destroy you.|- Putting your life on the line.
{11849}{11924}You don't think of it like that.|I wish you'd visit.
{11927}{12013}Oh, but we'd visit you|and sit in your gorgeous house,
{12022}{12157}planning visits to the townships,|demanding to see the poorest of the poor.
{12169}{12304}"Are you sure they're the worst off?|I mean, we've come all this way."
{12313}{12466}"We don't want to see people just mildly|victimised by apartheid. We want shock."
{12478}{12595}It doesn't seem right sitting on|the East Side talking about revolution.
{12607}{12697}Only small, murky cafés|for Pépé le Moko here.
{12703}{12859}No. No. La Pasionaria. We'll build|barricades and lean against them, singing.
{12871}{12985}- And the people will follow.|- Follow, follow, follow. What is that song?
{12990}{13101}It's our role in history,|and we offer ourselves up to it.
{13113}{13209}It's your role in history, it's not our role.|The Fantasticks.
{13218}{13281}Follow, follow, follow, follow
{13290}{13374}A role in history - to say that so easily.
{13380}{13539}To lead the people. Like Lech Walesa|and the striking shipyard workers.
{13548}{13641}Gorbachev urging on|the striking coal miners.
{13647}{13716}The phrase "striking coal miners" -
{13722}{13869}I always picture these very striking|coal miners modelling the fall fashion.
{14090}{14204}- Why is there a statue of a husky?|- Another drink before we...?
{14210}{14294}Where shall we?|God, the restaurants in New York.
{14303}{14435}It's like Florence in the 16th century -|genius on every corner.
{14444}{14534}- There's good Szechwan. Hunan.|- (woman laughs)
{14543}{14606}The sign painter screwed up the sign.
{14612}{14768}Instead of painting "The Hunan Wok",|he painted "The Human Wok".
{14780}{14894}- We sent it to The Times.|- They have a joke page, and...
{14903}{14951}They send you champagne.
{14957}{15085}We weren't auditioning, but all I could|think was "$2,000,000. $2,000,000".
{15094}{15205}Like when people say "Don't think|about elephants", it's all you think.
{15298}{15322}(buzzer)
{15328}{15409}Whatever you do,|don't think about elephants.
{15418}{15547}- Elephants?|- Ouisa is a Dada manifesto.
{15556}{15613}About the Cézanne.
{15643}{15784}Unless we're careful,|it'll be sold and never seen again.
{15910}{16035}Mid period. Landscape|of a dark green forest.
{16044}{16158}In the far distance you see the sunlight.
{16164}{16299}One of his first uses of a pale colour being|forced to carry the weight of the picture.
{16311}{16398}An experiment that would|pay off in the apples.
{16407}{16494}Burst of colour has to carry so much.
{16551}{16701}Japanese don't like anything|about it except it's a Cézanne.
{16824}{16988}I... I'm so sorry to bother you, but...|I've been hurt, and I've lost everything.
{17000}{17135}I didn't know where to go. Your children.|I'm a friend of your children.
{17144}{17219}- He mentioned our kids' names.|- And their school.
{17228}{17348}- Harvard. You can say Harvard.|- I don't want to get into libel.
{17357}{17465}I was mugged... out there in Central Park.
{17519}{17612}By the statue of that Alaskan husky.
{17621}{17702}I was trying to figure out|why there was a statue of a dog
{17711}{17804}who saved lives in the Yukon|in the middle of Central Park.
{17813}{17936}- When I was trying to puzzle it out...|- Are you OK?
{17942}{18043}They took my money and my briefcase.|I said "My thesis..."
{18052}{18154}- His shirt's bleeding.|- The shirt isn't bleeding. He's bleeding.
{18160}{18211}Oh.
{18220}{18277}Sorry. I get this way around blood.
{18280}{18373}No! My God, not on the rug, please.|Eddie, get the doctor.
{18382}{18460}No. No. I'll survive.
{18469}{18538}No doctors. Please?
{18547}{18631}All right, Eddie. We'll call you.
{18640}{18694}Thank you, Eddie.
{18703}{18751}Um...
{18757}{18817}(stranger) I don't mind the money.
{18826}{18967}But in the age of mechanical reproduction,|they got the only copy of my thesis.
{18973}{19065}Ouisa, where's the first-aid book?
{19647}{19746}The Red Cross advises|"Press edges of wound firmly together."
{19758}{19848}- Yes, I'm doing that.|- (screams)
{19854}{19923}Hold on. Ouisa, I need gauze.
{19932}{20015}- It's been wonderful seeing you.|- No. Stay.
{20021}{20117}My time is so short.|Before I leave America, I really should...
{20123}{20228}- Did you see the new book on Cézanne?|- Er, no. May I use the phone?
{20243}{20300}An absolute revelation.
{20303}{20342}I ran down the hall...
{20420}{20528}..got the book on Cézanne,|got the gauze from the kitchen,
{20540}{20651}gave the Cézanne to Flan,|and the gauze to Geoffrey.
{20657}{20711}Ouisa!
{20858}{21010}It's a lovely book.|I'll get him a clean shirt. Please stay.
{21115}{21214}- And peace was restored.|- And then...
{21223}{21301}Your children said you were kind.
{21328}{21490}All the kids were sitting around the dorm|dishing the... shit out of their parents.
{21505}{21703}But your kids were silent. They said|"No. Not our parents. Not Flan and Ouisa."
{21715}{21829}"Not the Kittredges.|The Kittredges are kind."
{21835}{21952}So, after the muggers left, I looked up,|saw these Fifth Avenue apartments.
{21967}{22083}Mrs Onassis lives there.|I know the Babcocks live over there.
{22089}{22158}The Auchinclosses live there.
{22167}{22251}But... you lived here.
{22260}{22311}I came here.
{22341}{22407}Can you believe what the kids said?
{22416}{22473}Mm. Well...
{22482}{22527}He mentioned our kids' names.
{22530}{22656}We can mention our kids' names. They|won't sue us for mentioning their names.
{22665}{22737}Talbot and Woody mean the world to me.
{22743}{22914}Woody? He lets you call him Woody?|Nobody's called him Woody in years.
{22991}{23102}They described this apartment in detail.
{23108}{23252}Oh, this is a Kandinsky!|A double - one painted on either side.
{23264}{23312}May I see?
{23315}{23372}Yes, of course.
{23405}{23513}Extraordinary.|What makes it exceptional is that
{23519}{23672}Kandinsky painted on either side of the|canvas in two radically different styles.
{23687}{23819}One wild and vivid,|the other sombre and geometric.
{23825}{23888}My God!
{23897}{23954}We flip it around for variety.
{23960}{24097}Chaos, control. Chaos, control.|You like? You like?
{24139}{24193}It's wonderful.
{24199}{24262}(Flan) Vasili Kandinsky.
{24268}{24385}Born 1866, Moscow.|Blue Rider exhibition, 1914.
{24400}{24553}He said "The choice of object that is one|of the elements in the harmony of form
{24559}{24694}must be decided only by a corresponding|vibration in the human soul."
{24751}{24823}Died 1944, France.
{24841}{24940}Everything is just the way|they said it would be.
{24952}{25023}Did you bitch your parents?
{25107}{25176}As a matter of fact, no.
{25179}{25344}Your kids and I, we both liked our -|liked? - loved our parents.
{25389}{25536}Am I getting in the way here? I'm sorry.|I burst in here hysterical... blood...
{25542}{25641}No. No, no. No, no, no, please.|No, please. Please. Sit down.
{25653}{25719}Tell us about our children.
{25725}{25809}Three. Two at Harvard,|and a girl at Groton.
{25848}{25950}- How is Harvard?|- Well, fine. It's just there.
{25959}{26042}Everyone's in a constant|state of luxurious despair
{26048}{26150}and constant discovery and paralysis.
{26159}{26237}- We asked him where home was.|- "Out West" he said.
{26243}{26363}Although I've lived all over.|My folks are divorced. He's remarried.
{26375}{26483}- Actually, he's doing a movie.|- He's in the movies?
{26489}{26630}- He's directing this one, but he does act.|- Really? Um...
{26642}{26723}- What's he directing?|- Cats.
{26777}{26864}- Someone is directing a film of Cats?|- Don't be snooty.
{26873}{26966}- You've seen it? TS Eliot?|- (Flan) Yes, years ago.
{26972}{27058}It was a benefit for some school...|or disease... What?
{27067}{27151}- They can't make the movie of Cats.|- Of course they can.
{27163}{27262}They're going to try.|My father'll be here, auditioning.
{27268}{27316}Cats?
{27361}{27460}- He's going to use people.|- What a courageous stand.
{27466}{27568}- They thought of animation...|- Animation would be nice.
{27577}{27688}But he found a better way. As a matter|of fact, he turned it down at first.
{27694}{27829}He went to tell the producers the reasons|why you couldn't make a movie of Cats.
{27844}{27996}And in going through the reasons why you|couldn't, he suddenly saw how you could.
{28002}{28104}Eureka in the bathtub. How wonderful!
{28149}{28212}May we ask who?
{28254}{28389}And it was then we pulled up -|ever so slightly - pulled up closer.
{28398}{28428}And he told us.
{28437}{28542}He named the greatest|black star in movies. Sidney...
{28551}{28677}No names! No names! We're trying|to keep this abstract. Plus, libel laws.
{28686}{28785}Sidney Poitier. There. I don't care!|You have to have truth!
{28791}{28914}He started out as a lawyer|and is terrified of libel. I'm not.
{28959}{29018}Sidney Poitier.
{29027}{29216}The future Jackie Robinson of films was|born 24th of February 1927 in Miami
{29231}{29303}during a visit his parents made to Florida.
{29309}{29351}(man) Legally?
{29357}{29444}To sell tomatoes|they had grown in the Bahamas.
{29450}{29576}He grew up on Cat lsland so poor they|didn't even own dirt, he has said.
{29585}{29732}Neglected by his family, my father would|sit on the shore, and, as he's told me:
{29744}{29894}"conjure up the worlds that were on|the other side, and what I'd do in them."
{29903}{30010}He arrived in New York City from|the Bahamas in the winter of 1943
{30016}{30130}at the age of 15 and a half, and lived|in the pay toilet of the bus station
{30142}{30253}across from the old Madison|Square Garden at 50th and 8th Avenue.
{30256}{30370}He moved to the roof of the Brill Building,|commonly known as Tin Pan Alley,
{30382}{30517}washed dishes at the Turf Restaurant|for $4 and 11 cents a night.
{30529}{30637}He taught himself to read|by reading the newspaper.
{30649}{30766}In the black newspaper, the theatre page|was opposite the want-ad page.
{30778}{30865}Among his 42 films are:
{30871}{31011}No Way Out, 1950, Cry, the Beloved|Country, 1952, Blackboard Jungle, 1955,
{31020}{31161}The Defiant Ones, 1958, A Raisin in|the Sun, 1961, Lilies of the Field, 1963,
{31173}{31356}In the Heat of the Night, 1967, To Sir,|with Love, 1967, Shoot to Kill, 1988,
{31368}{31404}and, of course...
{31407}{31491}Guess Who's Coming to Dinner!
{31515}{31653}He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field,|and was twice named top box-office star.
{31665}{31851}My father made no films from 1977 to|1987, but worked as director and author.
{31863}{31923}Dad said to me once:
{31929}{32009}"I still don't fully understand
{32018}{32162}how all this came about|in the sequence it came about."
{32171}{32231}(someone claps)
{32447}{32510}Dad's not in till tomorrow at the Sherry.
{32522}{32657}I came down from Cambridge. I thought|I'd stay at some fleabag for adventure.
{32669}{32744}Orwell, Down and Out...
{32753}{32903}I don't really know New York. I know|Rome, Paris and Los Angeles a lot better.
{32915}{33013}Well, we're going out to dinner.|You'll come.
{33022}{33094}- Out to dinner?|- Out to dinner.
{33100}{33208}- The new ltalian looked cheery.|- Good. We've made reservations.
{33214}{33355}- They wrap up ravioli like saltwater taffy.|- Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars.
{33364}{33430}But why go out to dinner?
{33436}{33553}Because we have reservations. What time|is it? Have we lost the reservations?
{33562}{33682}There's nothing in the house. And it's 16th|century Florence, genius on every block.
{33691}{33769}- Don't mock.|- You must have something in the fridge.
{33781}{33841}A frozen steak from the lce Age.
{33844}{33972}But why spend $100 on a bowl of rice?|Let me into the kitchen.
{33984}{34143}Cooking calms me. And what I'd like to do|is calm down. Pay back your kids.
{34146}{34269}- Two at Harvard. A daughter at Groton.|- Who've been wonderful.
{34281}{34347}- They never mentioned you.|- What'd they say?
{34350}{34524}"We know the son of Sidney Poitier,|barrier-breaker of the '50s and '60s"?
{34536}{34608}Your father means|a great deal in South Africa.
{34617}{34722}I'm glad of that. Dad and I went|to Russia once, to a film festival.
{34734}{34797}He was amazed how much|his presence meant.
{34806}{34964}No, no. Tell us stories of movie stars|tying up their children, being cruel.
{34976}{35069}- I wish.|- You wish?
{35075}{35201}If I wanted to write a book about him, I|really can't. No one would want to read it.
{35216}{35264}He's decent, and I admire him.
{35267}{35423}Oh, he's married to an actress. She was|in... um... um... She's white. Am I right?
{35432}{35561}That's not my mother. It's his second wife.|He met Joanna making The Lost Man,
{35570}{35702}and left my mother, who'd stuck by him|in the lean years. I had just been born.
{35717}{35840}The Lost Man is the only film of my|father's I can't bring myself to see.
{35849}{35924}- I'm so sorry. We didn't mean...|- No, no, no.
{35933}{36139}We're all good friends now, his kids|from that marriage and us - the old kids.
{36190}{36274}I'd love to get into that kitchen.
{36307}{36424}- What should we do?|- It's Geoffrey's only night in New York.
{36430}{36514}- I vote to stay in.|- Good!
{36526}{36598}We moved into the kitchen.
{36715}{36787}- We watched him cook.|- We watched him chop.
{36790}{36862}He did a sort of wizardry.|Leftovers. Onions.
{36868}{36916}- (Ouisa) Peppers.|- Tuna. Olives.
{36925}{37020}- (Ouisa) Ajar of sun-dried tomatoes.|- It was wonderful.
{37029}{37131}- So, you're from...?|- Johannesburg.
{37221}{37308}My dad took me to a movie|shot in South Africa.
{37317}{37416}The camera moves from|this vile rioting in the streets
{37422}{37497}to a villa where people picked|at lunch on a terrace.
{37506}{37671}The only riot, the flowers and the birds.|Gorgeous plumage and petals.
{37683}{37746}I didn't understand.
{37752}{37866}Dad said to me "You meet these young|blacks who are having a terrible time."
{37872}{38006}"They've had an inadequate education,|yet, in '76, the year of the Soweto riots,
{38018}{38159}they took on great political responsibility.|Just makes you wonder at their maturity."
{38168}{38273}It makes you realise that|the "crummy-childhood" theory,
{38279}{38399}that everything can be blamed in|a Freudian fashion on a bad upbringing,
{38408}{38504}just doesn't hold water.
{38516}{38573}May I?
{38717}{38825}What about being black in America?
{38834}{38968}Well, my problem is I've never felt|American. I grew up in Switzerland.
{38977}{39040}Boarding school. Villa Rosey.
{39049}{39187}There's a boarding school in Switzerland|that will take you at age 18 months.
{39196}{39343}No, no, no, no. That's not me. I've never|felt people liked me for my connections.
{39355}{39457}And movie-star-kid problems?|None of those.
{39493}{39610}I never knew I was black in that racist way|till I was 16 and came back here.
{39619}{39679}Very, very protected.
{39688}{39754}White servants.
{39763}{39871}After the divorce, we moved to|Switzerland - my mother, brother and I.
{39877}{40038}I don't feel American. I don't even feel|black. I suppose that's very lucky for me.
{40050}{40146}Even though Freud says|there's no such thing as luck.
{40158}{40263}Does Freud say that?|I think we're lucky having this dinner.
{40269}{40404}- Flan, can we eat in the dining room?|- Dining room.
{40413}{40506}Now, now, don't look at|the sewing machine.
{40755}{40812}So, is everything OK?
{40815}{40899}- This is the best pasta I've ever tasted.|- The best!
{40908}{41009}- My father insisted we learn to cook.|- He's from Jamaica, isn't he?
{41015}{41075}There's a taste of, um...
{41081}{41120}- The islands.|- Yes. Yeah.
{41129}{41225}Yes, before he made it,|he ran four restaurants in Harlem.
{41234}{41300}- You, sir, have good buds.|- "Good buds?"
{41306}{41390}I've never been|complimented on my buds.
{41399}{41459}- This is delicious.|- What about you?
{41465}{41534}Oh, no, no, no. The cook never eats.
{41540}{41663}What a good idea.|That means there's more for us.
{41675}{41750}- It's a treat to eat at home.|- We go out every night.
{41753}{41801}I have to. Business.
{41807}{41876}Have you declared your major yet?
{41885}{41962}You are like all parents -|"What's your major?"
{41971}{42097}Geoffrey, Harvard has all those great titles|the students give the courses.
{42103}{42166}"The holocaust and ethics"?
{42175}{42235}"Krauts and doubts."
{42265}{42313}A toast. To you.
{42316}{42373}Oh. No, no, no.
{42382}{42499}- To Cats.|- OK. Yes. To Cats.
{42676}{42748}Isn't this the finest time?
{42978}{43029}Hello?
{43080}{43119}Hello?
{43155}{43209}Hello?
{43257}{43320}- Seconds?|- Ah!
{43524}{43608}Blunt question. What's he like?
{43620}{43746}- Oh, let's not be star-fuckers.|- I'm not a star- fucker.
{43764}{43890}Well... you know my father. He's... perfect.
{43902}{43979}So confident and in control.
{43985}{44105}And I used to wonder how could|I ever possibly live up to him.
{44114}{44171}And then one night, when I was 16-
{44177}{44270}we were at the Cannes Film Festival,|of all places -
{44276}{44345}I looked up and said to him:
{44354}{44471}"Wow, Dad, this is all so easy for you."
{44480}{44561}Why did I say that?
{44567}{44666}He sat me down and set me straight.
{44675}{44780}Actually, it was a relief for me|to know my father was no superman.
{44786}{44948}That he has problems. And there are|moments in his life when he's scared.
{44962}{45070}And, yes, sometimes|life is whipping his tail.
{45079}{45214}And he doesn't feel like he can get|through the day. That's refreshing for me.
{45223}{45319}Because I have times like that myself.
{45358}{45454}I just loved the kid so much.|I wanted to reach out to him.
{45460}{45538}Then we asked him|what his thesis was on.
{45544}{45646}- The one that was stolen.|- Well...
{45655}{45802}A teacher out on Long lsland was dropped|from his job for fighting with a student.
{45814}{45990}Weeks later, he returned to the classroom,|shot the student - unsuccessfully,
{46002}{46149}held the class hostage,|and then shot himself - successfully.
{46158}{46272}This fact caught my eye.|Last sentence, Times -
{46281}{46377}"A neighbour described|the teacher as a nice boy,
{46386}{46485}always reading Catcher in the Rye. "
{46491}{46566}This nitwit Chapman,|who shot John Lennon,
{46578}{46722}said he did it to draw the attention|of the world to Catcher in the Rye,
{46734}{46809}and the reading of this book|would be his defence.
{46821}{46938}Young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot|Reagan and his press secretary, said:
{46947}{47141}"If you want my defence, all you|have to do is read... Catcher in the Rye. "
{47156}{47219}- I haven't read it in years.|- Shh.
{47225}{47339}I borrowed a copy from a young friend.|I wanted to see what she had underlined.
{47351}{47498}And I read this book to find out why|this touching, beautiful, sensitive story,
{47507}{47678}published in July 1951,|had turned into this manifesto of hate.
{47690}{47816}I started reading. It's exactly as I had|remembered. Everybody's a phoney.
{47828}{47915}Page two - "My brother's|in Hollywood being a prostitute."
{47918}{48001}Page three -|"What a phoney slob his father was."
{48007}{48112}Page nine -|"People never notice anything."
{48127}{48220}Then, on page 22, my hair stood up.
{48229}{48256}Well...
{48259}{48412}Remember Holden Caulfield, the definitive|sensitive youth wearing his hunter's cap?
{48421}{48472}A deer hunter's cap?
{48481}{48592}"Like hell it is. I sort of closed one eye|like I was taking aim at it."
{48604}{48676}"This is a people shooting hat."
{48682}{48760}"I shoot people in this hat."
{48847}{48960}This book is preparing people for bigger|moments than I had ever dreamed of.
{48969}{49092}Then, on page 89,|"I'd rather push a guy out the window
{49101}{49218}or chop his head off with an axe|than sock him in the jaw."
{49224}{49383}"I hate fistfights. What scares|me most is the other guy's face."
{49446}{49518}I finished the book.|It's touching and comic.
{49527}{49608}The boy wants to do so much|and can't do anything.
{49614}{49695}Hates all phoniness|and only lies to others.
{49701}{49869}Wants everyone to like him but is only|hateful and is completely self involved.
{49881}{50039}In other words, a pretty accurate|picture of a male adolescent.
{50084}{50282}What alarms me about the book - not the|book so much as the aura about it - is this.
{50294}{50393}The book is primarily about paralysis.|The boy can't function.
{50402}{50588}At the end, before he can run away and|start a new life, it starts to rain. He folds.
{50600}{50717}There's nothing wrong in writing about|emotional and intellectual paralysis.
{50723}{50873}It may, thanks to Chekhov and Samuel|Beckett, be the great modern theme.
{50885}{50983}The extraordinary last lines|of Waiting for Godot.;
{50992}{51037}"Let's go."
{51040}{51079}"Yes."
{51088}{51118}"Let's go."
{51124}{51184}Stage directions:
{51190}{51244}"They do not move."
{51289}{51340}The aura around Salinger's book -
{51343}{51439}which, perhaps, should be|read by everyone but young men - is this.
{51448}{51502}It mirrors like a fun-house mirror,
{51514}{51640}and amplifies like a distorted speaker|one of the great tragedies of our times -
{51649}{51724}the death of the imagination.
{51733}{51814}Because what else is paralysis?
{51820}{51990}The imagination has been|so debased that imagination...
{52002}{52113}being imaginative, rather than|being the linchpin of our existence,
{52119}{52206}now stands as a synonym for|something outside ourselves.
{52212}{52260}Like science fiction.
{52266}{52428}Or some new use for tangerine slices|on raw pork chops -
{52437}{52578}"What an imaginative summer recipe."|And Star Wars - "so imaginative".
{52590}{52662}And Star Trek - "so imaginative".
{52665}{52797}And Lord of the Rings,|all those dwarves - "so imaginative".
{52809}{52917}The imagination has moved out|of the realm of being our link,
{52926}{53039}our most personal link, with our inner|lives and the world outside that world,
{53048}{53093}this world we share.
{53099}{53171}What is schizophrenia|but a horrifying state
{53177}{53267}where what's in here|doesn't match what's out there?
{53273}{53402}Why has imagination|become a synonym for style?
{53411}{53513}I believe the imagination|is the passport that we create
{53525}{53594}to help take us into the real world.
{53600}{53774}I believe the imagination is merely another|phrase for what is most uniquely us.
{53804}{53953}Jung says "The greatest sin|is to be unconscious."
{53989}{54136}Our boy Holden says "What scares me|most is the other guy's face."
{54154}{54295}"It wouldn't be so bad|if you could both be blindfolded."
{54310}{54475}Most of the time, the faces that we face|are not the other guys', but our own faces.
{54484}{54634}And it is the worst kind of yellowness|to be so scared of yourself
{54646}{54790}that you put blindfolds on|rather than deal with yourself.
{54829}{54960}To face ourselves - that's the hard thing.
{54981}{55038}The imagination...
{55080}{55269}that's God's gift to make|the act of self-examination bearable.
{55344}{55389}Well...
{55428}{55479}Indeed.
{55500}{55647}- I hope your muggers read every word.|- (Ouisa laughs) Oh, darling!
{55728}{55827}I'm going to buy Catcher in the Rye|at the airport and read it.
{55836}{55914}- Cover to cover.|- I'll test you.
{55961}{56027}- I should be going.|- Where will you stay?
{56033}{56084}Oh, no, not some fleabag.
{56090}{56219}No, no, no. I get into the Sherry tomorrow|morning. It's not far off. I can walk around.
{56234}{56351}- I don't think they'll mug me twice.|- You'll stay here tonight.
{56360}{56447}No. I have to be at the hotel at 7 am sharp.
{56459}{56540}- We'll get you up.|- Or Dad will have a fit.
{56546}{56633}Up at 6.15, which is any moment now.|And we have that wedding.
{56639}{56741}- There's an alarm by the bed.|- Your feet may hang over the edge...
{56753}{56879}- If it's any problem...|- The only problem is if you leave.
{56924}{56998}6.15? I'll tiptoe out.
{57004}{57088}- And we want to be in Cats.|- Oh, Flan!
{57094}{57181}- It's done!|- I'll fly back... with my wife.
{57190}{57256}Well... Pushy, both of you.
{57262}{57424}You're not. Dad said I could be in charge|of the extras. That's all I can promise.
{57436}{57556}- In cat suits?|- No, you can be humans.
{57562}{57706}That's very important. It has to be|in our contracts. We are humans.
{57718}{57778}We haven't got any business done.
{57787}{57898}Oh, forget it.|It was just an evening at home.
{57910}{58023}Whatever you do,|don't think about elephants.
{58035}{58080}- Did I intrude?|- No.
{58083}{58224}There are all ways of doing business.|Flan, walk me to the elevator.
{58245}{58320}We embraced, and Flan and Geoffrey left.
{58443}{58515}- Let me clean up.|- No, no. Please leave it.
{58518}{58617}- Nobody comes in on Sunday.|- No. Yvonne'll be in on Tuesday.
{58623}{58689}- You'll have every bug in Christendom.|- Let me.
{58701}{58773}No! You watch.
{58779}{58869}It gives me a thrill to be looked at.
{58982}{59063}- Ouisa! He's in.|- He's in?
{59069}{59162}For two million.|Says the Cézanne is a great investment.
{59171}{59249}We should get six million for it|and sell it for ten.
{59255}{59345}Happy days! Oh, God!
{59378}{59483}- Oh, break all those dishes!|- $2,000,000?
{59492}{59648}Figure it out. He doesn't have the price|of dinner, but he can cough up $2,000,000.
{59660}{59783}- And the Japanese will go to ten.|- Go to ten? Ten million?
{59789}{59870}Two million, go to ten,|and we put up nothing.
{59882}{59941}- Nothing?|- No.
{59950}{60055}Wildest dreams. Oh, God, Paul. Money.
{60061}{60121}- Take $50.|- Oh, no.
{60127}{60190}- It's walking-around money.|- I don't need it.
{60196}{60313}- What if your father's plane is late?|- A billionth of a per cent commission.
{60319}{60427}I wouldn't want one of my kids|stuck in the street without a nickel.
{60439}{60568}Your kids said you were an art dealer, but|you have no gallery. I don't understand.
{60577}{60649}Come here.
{60718}{60829}- Some people want to sell privately.|- Divorce, taxes, publicity...
{60835}{60928}- People ask me for certain schools.|- Modern, Impressionist...
{60937}{61020}- They don't want museums to know.|- Japanese.
{61026}{61158}I've got Japanese looking for a Cézanne.|I have a syndicate that'll buy the painting.
{61170}{61305}And there's this great Cézanne coming|up for sale in a very messy divorce.
{61311}{61374}Wife doesn't want hubby to know...
{61383}{61533}I needed an extra $2,000,000.|Geoffrey called. We invited him for dinner.
{61542}{61659}- Tonight was a nervous, casual, big thing.|- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
{61671}{61740}- I couldn't tell.|- All the better.
{61743}{61812}I'm glad I helped.
{61821}{61869}You were wonderful.
{61881}{61964}I'm so pleased I was wonderful.
{61970}{62099}- All this and a pink shirt.|- Oh, please, keep it. Look at the time.
{62108}{62189}Oh, God. We should say our good-nights.
{62195}{62324}Oh, Christ, regretfully.|I want my father to meet you.
{62333}{62429}- We'd love to. Bring him up for dinner.|- Could I?
{62438}{62576}- See how easy it is?|- Sure. If Paul does the cooking.
{62618}{62675}Well, this is it.
{62726}{62810}- Good night.|- Oh. Good night.
{62822}{62879}Good night.
{62989}{63154}I want to get down|on my knees and thank God.
{63163}{63229}Money!
{63235}{63322}Who said "When artists dream,|they dream of money"?
{63331}{63415}God, I must be such an artist.
{63421}{63499}Bravo. Bravo!
{63508}{63550}Bravo!
{63559}{63616}Oh, God!
{63670}{63817}I don't want to lose our life here. I don't|want all the debt to pile up and crush us.
{63832}{63904}It won't. We're safe.
{63936}{64011}For a while.
{64020}{64095}We almost lost it, Ouis.
{64107}{64275}If I hadn't gotten this money, I would have|lost the Cézanne. I had nowhere to find it.
{64281}{64377}Why don't you tell me|how much these things mean?
{64389}{64476}You wait until the last minute.
{64479}{64587}- I don't want to worry you.|- Not worry me?
{64599}{64659}I'm your partner.
{64689}{64755}- There is a God!|- And his name is?
{64761}{64833}- Geoffrey!|- No! Sidney!
{65642}{65786}You know, I had the strangest dream.|I dreamt of Cats.
{65795}{65861}(purring and mewing)
{65867}{65932}The movie.
{65941}{66019}Paul... I'm worried.
{66028}{66127}Is it right to make a movie of Cats?
{66133}{66280}I'll tell you why there has to be a movie|of Cats, Ouisa. May I call you Ouisa?
{66289}{66322}Yes.
{66331}{66409}I have no illusions|about the merits of Cats,
{66412}{66502}but the world has been|too heavy with the right- to- lifers -
{66511}{66643}protect the unborn, constitutional|amendments, when does life begin?
{66655}{66796}Or the converse - the end of life, the right|to die. Why is life, at this point in time,
{66808}{66942}so focused upon the very beginning of life|and the very end of life?
{66954}{67086}What about the 80 years we have to live|between those two inexorable book ends?
{67095}{67176}And you can get all that into Cats?
{67227}{67287}We're going to try.
{67293}{67362}Thank you. Thank you.
{67368}{67428}You shall.
{67551}{67650}This is what I dreamt.|I didn't dream, so much as realise this.
{67659}{67788}I feel so close to the paintings.|I'm not just selling, like pieces of meat.
{67797}{67914}I remembered why I loved paintings|in the first place, what got me into this.
{67920}{67970}I thought...
{67976}{68027}dreamt...
{68084}{68147}remembered...
{68156}{68245}how easy it is for a painter|to lose a painting.
{68245}{68333}He paints and paints,|works on a canvas for months,
{68345}{68456}and then, one day, he loses it.
{68465}{68588}Loses the structure, loses the sense of it.|You lose the painting.
{68600}{68729}I remembered asking my kids'|second-grade teacher:
{68741}{68840}"Why are all your students geniuses?"
{68846}{68986}Look at the first grade - blotches of green|and black. The third grade - camouflage.
{68995}{69088}But your grade, the second grade...
{69094}{69166}Matisses, every one.
{69175}{69262}You've made my child a Matisse.
{69376}{69442}Let me study with you.
{69451}{69538}Let me into the second grade.
{69544}{69607}What is your secret?
{69613}{69775}I don't have any secret. I just know when|to take their drawings away from them.
{69790}{69850}I dreamt of colour.
{69859}{69936}I dreamt of our son's pink shirt.
{69942}{70017}I dreamt of pinks and yellows.
{70029}{70134}And the new Van Gogh|the Museum of Modern Art got.
{70140}{70242}And the irises that sold for $53.9 million.
{70251}{70416}And, wishing a Van Gogh was mine,|I looked at my English hand-lasted shoes,
{70425}{70581}and thought of Van Gogh's tragic shoes,|and remembered me as I was -
{70596}{70674}a painter losing a painting.
{70746}{70791}So. This morning.
{70809}{70923}I sat in the kitchen, happily doing|the crossword puzzle in ink.
{70928}{70979}Everybody does it in ink.
{70991}{71096}I've never met one person|who didn't say they didn't do it in ink.
{71105}{71231}I sat there happily doing the puzzle.|I looked at the time. It was nearly seven.
{71240}{71381}And Paul had to meet his father,|and I didn't want him to be late.
{71396}{71453}(groaning)
{71459}{71498}Paul?
{71534}{71597}- Paul?|- (groaning)
{71603}{71663}Paul, are you OK?
{71666}{71717}Paul?
{71762}{71840}What the fuck's goin' on here?|Who the fuck are you?
{71858}{71915}Flan!
{71956}{71992}Flan!
{71998}{72049}(Flan) Ouisa?
{72049}{72100}What is it?
{72106}{72247}- God! There's someone in the house.|- Someone's in the...?
{72256}{72349}- Yes, hello?|- Frank? I need help up here right away.
{72400}{72502}- Hey. How you doin'?|- My God!
{72550}{72601}Ho-ho-ho!
{72610}{72682}Nice stuff!
{72691}{72784}- Fancy chair.|- Oh! Ouisa! Argh!
{72820}{72901}- I can explain.|- You went out and picked up this thing?
{72910}{73056}You brought this thing into our house?!|Thing! Thing! Get out of my house!
{73068}{73137}- Stop it! He might have a gun!|- A gun?!
{73146}{73224}Yeah, I might have a gun.|I might have a knife!
{73233}{73278}Oh! Ouisa!
{73431}{73503}Get out! Get out! Get out!
{73509}{73578}Take your clothes|and go back to the gutter!
{73584}{73659}Take it easy with my pants!
{73785}{73872}- Fuck you!|- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
{73878}{73943}- Please, don't tell my father.|- Just go.
{73952}{74033}- I got so lonely and so afraid...|- Give me back my $50.
{74039}{74114}I spent it. You had so much.|I couldn't be alone!
{74123}{74186}Get out.
{74195}{74249}- Get out.|- Everything all right?
{74258}{74372}Of course everything's all right.|Make sure they leave - by the back door.
{74381}{74429}I'm so sorry.
{74468}{74528}(gasping)
{74555}{74633}- My God!|- Is anything gone?
{74642}{74738}- How can I look? I'm shaking.|- I wanna know if anything's gone.
{74747}{74843}- Calm down.|- We could've been killed. The Kandinsky!
{74849}{74947}Kandinsky! Oh, no, there it is.|The silver Victorian inkwell.
{74956}{75073}- How can you think about things?!|- Thank God. There's the inkwell.
{75079}{75139}Silver jaguar.
{75178}{75265}- Why?|- Slashed. Throats slashed.
{75304}{75343}There's the Degas.
{75352}{75454}Go to bed at night happy and then|murdered. Would we have woken up?
{75463}{75523}We're alive.
{75571}{75652}And that's that.
{75664}{75709}Well, it's not.
{75790}{75853}I think we could tell if someone was here.
{75856}{75913}- We didn't all night.|- (phone rings)
{75924}{76041}Oh! No, don't.|Don't pick up that phone. It's him!
{76122}{76164}- Hello?|- Flanders?
{76170}{76200}Geoffrey!
{76203}{76359}I've been thinking. Those Japs|really want the Cézanne. They'll pay.
{76368}{76470}You can depend on me|for an additional overcall of 250.
{76566}{76707}And I was thinking, for South Africa,|what about a black American film festival?
{76719}{76782}With this Spike Lee you have now.
{76791}{76893}And, of course, get Poitier down|to be the president of the jury.
{76914}{76970}And I know Cosby.
{76976}{77051}And I love this Eddie Murphy.
{77057}{77234}And my wife, she went fishing with Diana|Ross and her new Norwegian husband.
{77246}{77306}And they must have some new blacks.
{77309}{77378}It sounds a wonderful idea.
{77387}{77441}I'll call Poitier at the Sherry.
{77447}{77564}- No! No, no. We'll call.|- They're calling my plane.
{77570}{77657}- And again, last night...|- No need to thank.
{77669}{77729}- See you shortly.|- The banks?
{77732}{77774}My lawyers.
{77807}{77852}- Thank you, sir.|- Exactly.
{77864}{77941}- Safe trip.|- Thank you.
{77947}{78025}(Ouisa) And here we are.
{78343}{78385}Safe.
{79287}{79383}- Yoo-hoo! Do we have a story to tell you?|- Whoo!
{79392}{79503}- Do we have a story to tell you?!|- Let us tell you our story first.
{79509}{79596}- When did your story happen?|- Saturday night.
{79608}{79716}We win! Our story happened|Friday night, so we go first.
{79719}{79797}Our two and their son|are at Harvard together.
{79827}{79979}- We're going to be in the movies.|- We are going to be in the movie of Cats.
{79988}{80054}Yes!
{80063}{80144}You tell your story first.
{80150}{80240}Friday night we were home.|The door bell rang.
{80249}{80351}I am not impressed, but it is the son of...
{80363}{80393}You got it!
{80399}{80507}The kid was mugged.|We had to go out. We left him.
{80516}{80603}He was so charming.
{80615}{80741}His father was taking the redeye.|He couldn't get into the hotel till 7 am.
{80750}{80795}He stayed with us.
{80801}{80891}Middle of the night,|somebody screamed "Burglar!"
{80900}{81067}We came out in the hall. Paul is chasing|this naked blond thief down the corridor.
{81079}{81223}Blond thief runs out, the alarms go off.|The kid saved our lives.
{81232}{81340}- That was no burglar.|- You had another house guest.
{81352}{81397}We feel so guilty.
{81406}{81514}Paul could've been killed by that intruder.|He was very understanding.
{81523}{81595}- Was anything missing from your house?|- No.
{81604}{81751}- Did you give Paul any money?|- $25 till his father arrived.
{81802}{81865}We told them our story.
{81871}{81930}Oh!
{81936}{82023}- Have you talked to your kids?|- Couldn't get through.
{82029}{82125}We could go back to our place|and phone them.
{82206}{82293}Hello. Sherry-Netherland?|I'd like to speak to...
{82305}{82422}- She gave the name.|- No, I'm not a fan. This is not a fan call.
{82431}{82515}Sidney Poitier must be registered.|His son is...
{82521}{82575}- (receptionist hangs up)|- Oh!
{82581}{82683}- Bet he's there under another name.|- (buzzer)
{82692}{82755}Try Celebrity Service.
{82857}{82955}Hello, Celebrity Service?|I'm not sure how you work.
{82964}{83018}Greta Garbo used "Harriet Brown".
{83024}{83105}- You find celebrities?|- They must've known she was Garbo.
{83117}{83198}I'd like to know how one|would get in touch with...
{83204}{83231}Oh!
{83237}{83387}No, I'm not a press agent. No, I'm not with|anyone. My husband, Flanders Kittredge...
{83402}{83510}- (receptionist hangs up)|- They do not give out information.
{83513}{83603}- Try the public library.|- Try Who's Who.
{83654}{83744}"To thank you for a wonderful time."
{83753}{83813}"Paul Poitier."
{83867}{83968}- A pot of jam.|- Pot of jam? Jesus!
{84022}{84121}I think we should go to the police.
{84127}{84211}- What are the charges?|- He came into our house.
{84220}{84334}- He told us about Catcher in the Rye.|- He said he was the son of Sidney Poitier.
{84343}{84397}- Sidney Poitier?|- You got it!
{84400}{84439}- Was he?|- We don't know.
{84445}{84502}- We gave him $50.|- We gave him 25.
{84514}{84562}- He picked up a hustler.|- He left.
{84565}{84646}- He chased the burglar out.|- He didn't steal anything.
{84652}{84721}- We looked.|- Top to bottom. Nothing gone.
{84727}{84802}- This does not seem major now...|- Look.
{84814}{84880}- We are very busy.|- You can't chuck us out.
{84883}{84960}Come up with some charges,|then I can do something.
{85077}{85218}- Yes, there is another chapter.|- Our kids came down from Harvard.
{85227}{85299}(arguing)
{85407}{85539}The details he knew -|how would he know about the painting?
{85554}{85662}Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky.
{85725}{85788}And none of you know this fellow?
{85794}{85952}He has this wild quality, yet an elegance.|A real concern. And a real consideration.
{85961}{86030}(girl) Mom, you should have let him stay.
{86039}{86168}You should have divorced all your|children and just let this dreamboat stay.
{86174}{86258}- Plus, he sent you flowers.|- And jam.
{86267}{86333}Ooh!
{86339}{86477}If only we could just get in touch with|his father, find out if there's any truth in it.
{86486}{86579}Who knows Sidney Poitier?|We could just call him up and ask.
{86585}{86684}- I have a friend who does theatrical law...|- What friend?
{86693}{86747}- It's nobody.|- I want to know.
{86759}{86813}Nobody.
{86816}{86873}- Oh. Oh. Oh.|- Nobody! Nobody!
{86879}{87058}- I don't want to know.|- Larkin! This is not the time to do this!
{87070}{87172}Mom, Dad, please! For once! Please!
{87181}{87238}(arguing)
{87292}{87370}(woman) It's got nothing|to do with you, Ben.
{87376}{87421}Tess!
{87454}{87634}When you see your little sister, don't tell|her that Paul and the hustler used her bed.
{87649}{87715}You put him in that bed.
{87724}{87808}I'm not getting involved in any conspiracy.
{87817}{87936}It's not a conspiracy!|Hello, Alf. It's a family.
{88092}{88176}The imagination.
{88182}{88260}It's there to sort out your nightmare.
{88269}{88365}To show you the exit|from the maze of your nightmare.
{88371}{88521}To transform the nightmare into|dreams that become your bedrock.
{88566}{88677}If we do not listen to that voice, it dies.
{88683}{88740}It shrivels.
{88773}{88830}It vanishes.
{88890}{88976}The imagination is not our escape.
{89015}{89192}On the contrary. The imagination|is the place we are all trying to get to.
{89231}{89276}(screams)
{89360}{89417}(phone rings)
{89597}{89702}- Hello?|- I had a call that might interest you.
{89732}{89813}(Flan) And a new character|entered our story.
{90004}{90151}Well, it was really quite extraordinary,|very unusual. I was seeing a patient...
{90157}{90292}Dr Fine, there's a friend|of your son's here. He's hurt.
{90304}{90349}- My God.|- Hi.
{90352}{90397}- I was mugged.|- Come in.
{90403}{90547}He was more scared than hurt.|A knife wound. A few bruises.
{90580}{90649}- I don't know how to thank you.|- Don't be silly.
{90652}{90703}My father'll be here tomorrow.
{90712}{90787}He's making a movie of Cats.
{90793}{90841}Yes.
{90844}{90957}And this man had been|a matinée idol of my youth.
{90966}{91092}Somebody who had really forged ahead|and made new paths for blacks
{91098}{91200}just by the strength of his own talent.
{91209}{91350}Strangely, I'd identified with him|before I started medical school.
{91356}{91479}I mean, I'm a Jew.|My grandparents were killed in the war.
{91494}{91635}And I had this sense of self-hatred, of fear.
{91644}{91707}And this kid's father,
{91716}{91887}the bravery of his films,|gave me a direction, confidence.
{91940}{91991}Simple as that.
{92000}{92078}We're always paying off debts.
{92114}{92252}Then my beeper went off - a patient in|her tenth month. Her water finally broke.
{92261}{92309}I gave the kid my keys.
{92318}{92375}- Number 121.|- Thank you.
{92378}{92468}- Doug told me all about your brownstone.|- Is that right?
{92480}{92582}How you got it at a great price|because there'd been a murder in it,
{92588}{92654}and people thought it had a curse.
{92666}{92753}But you, sir, were a scientific man,|and were courageous.
{92759}{92810}Well, yes. Courageous.
{92816}{92876}Very courageous.
{92882}{92950}I ran off to the delivery room.
{92959}{93040}- Twins. Two boys.|- (woman) Ahh.
{93046}{93160}I thought of my son.|I dialled my boy at Dartmouth.
{93169}{93274}Amazingly, he was in his room.|Doing what, I hate to ask.
{93280}{93364}You've accused me of having|no interest in your life,
{93373}{93475}of not doing for your friends,|being a rotten father.
{93484}{93568}Well, this should make you very happy.
{93628}{93715}The son of who?|Dad, I never heard of him.
{93748}{93862}Dad, as usual, you're a real cretin.|You gave him the keys?
{93868}{94005}You gave a stranger who happens to|mention my name the keys to our house?!
{94020}{94116}Dad, sometimes it's|so obvious to me why Mom left.
{94122}{94221}I'm so embarrassed to know you!
{94233}{94362}You gave the keys to a stranger|who shows up at your office?!
{94374}{94512}Mom told me you beat her, and you drank|so much your body smelt of cheap wine.
{94524}{94656}Mom said sleeping with you was like|sleeping with a salad with bad dressing!
{94665}{94791}- Why did you bring me into this world?!|- There are two sides to every story.
{94797}{94854}You're an idiot! You're an idiot!
{94875}{94943}I went home, courageously.
{95027}{95084}With a policeman.
{95108}{95180}( string quartet music )
{95333}{95393}(volume increases)
{95399}{95489}(door opens and closes)
{95582}{95645}Arrest him!
{95654}{95714}- Pardon?|- Breaking and entering!
{95717}{95801}- Breaking and entering?|- You're an impostor!
{95807}{95962}Officer, Your Honour, Your Eminence, Dr|Fine gave me the keys to his brownstone.
{95977}{96079}- Isn't that so?|- My son doesn't know you!
{96088}{96163}This man gave me the keys to his house.|Isn't that so?
{96175}{96313}- Did you give him your keys?|- Yes, but... but under false pretences.
{96319}{96490}This... this fucking black kid,|crack addict, comes into my office...
{96505}{96595}I've taken this much brandy,|but can pour the rest back.
{96607}{96742}I've used the electricity listening to music,|but nothing's been taken from the house.
{96751}{96805}Excuse me.
{96811}{96871}I want you to arrest this fraud!
{96883}{96945}- I'm sorry.|- Stop him!
{96954}{97077}A cretin! A creep!|No wonder Mother left you!
{97128}{97218}Two sides... every story.
{97335}{97428}We decided to get a copy|of Sidney Poitier's autobiography.
{97434}{97545}So we go down to the Strand|Book Store - eight miles of books.
{97554}{97629}(Flan) Five Sherlock Holmeses.
{97662}{97779}I've found it! This Life by Sidney Poitier.
{97824}{97904}"Back in New York,|with Juanita and the children,
{97910}{98006}I became aware that our marriage,|while working on some levels,
{98015}{98132}was falling apart|in other fundamental areas."
{98168}{98309}Oh, there's a picture of him|and his four... daughters.
{98318}{98414}- No sons?|- No sons.
{98483}{98555}lmagine our surprise.
{98606}{98684}Well... shall we?
{98822}{98905}This kid, bulldozing his way into our lives.
{98914}{98971}We let him into our lives.
{98977}{99070}I run a foundation,|you're a dealer, you're a doctor.
{99079}{99142}You'd think we'd be satisfied.
{99145}{99250}Agatha Christie would ask|"What do we all have in common?"
{99256}{99397}It seems the common thread linking us all|is a need to be in the movie of Cats.
{99409}{99478}Our kids, struggling through their lives.
{99484}{99589}I don't want to know anything|about the spillover of their lives.
{99601}{99745}All we have in common is, our children|went to boarding school together.
{99754}{99895}- Why have we never met?|- His mother had custody. I lived out West.
{99909}{100035}After Doug graduated high school,|she moved West, I moved East.
{100047}{100176}- I think we should drop it right here.|- Are you afraid Ben is mixed up in this?
{100188}{100314}- I don't wanna know too much about him.|- You think Ben is hiding things from us?
{100326}{100518}I'm getting to the bottom of it. My son has|no involvements with any black frauds.
{100527}{100692}- Doctor, you said something about crack.|- No, that just leapt out. No proof.
{100725}{100785}Good God, no proof!
{100794}{100910}We'll take a vote. Do we pursue this, no|matter what we find out about our kids?
{100919}{100991}- I vote yes.|- Me too.
{101009}{101075}- I trust Doug.|- No.
{101099}{101141}Yes.
{101156}{101288}Listen to this last page. "We have hidden|too much from our modern children."
{101300}{101357}"When we are scared,|we tend not to let them know."
{101363}{101462}"They see the bravest, toughest, and|most impenetrable visage we can muster,
{101468}{101567}precisely at those times|when we are most afraid."
{101579}{101687}"We called it making it better for our|children, protecting them. From what?"
{101699}{101801}"The truth is what we were|protecting those little people from."
{102166}{102214}What did you do next?
{102220}{102286}- Went to Harvard.|- To enlist our children.
{102535}{102604}Why do you keep insisting|it's someone we know?
{102613}{102685}It's no one from our high school!
{102688}{102817}It's someone you went to high school|with, since you go to different colleges.
{102829}{102948}- Doug, I appreciate your coming here.|- Dad, spare me.
{102957}{103026}He knows the details of our lives.
{103035}{103152}Who, in your high school, has become|homosexual or is deep into drugs?
{103161}{103227}- About 15 people.|- I don't want to know.
{103233}{103329}I find it really insulting that|you assume it has to be a guy.
{103341}{103422}He could have been|with a girl in high school.
{103428}{103500}That's your problem. You're so limited.
{103509}{103605}- That's why I'm going to climb mountains.|- You're not.
{103614}{103704}We have not invested all this money|in you to scale the face of K2.
{103710}{103788}Is that all I am? An investment?!
{103797}{103910}No. Track down everyone|in your class - male, female, whatever.
{103919}{104003}Not just homosexuals, drug addicts.|He could be a dealer.
{104012}{104123}Why do you look at me when you say|that? You think I'm an addict? A pusher?
{104129}{104177}I resent the accusations.
{104183}{104255}No one is accusing you of anything.|Now, sit down!
{104264}{104318}I don't wanna know!
{104327}{104402}Nobody is accusing anyone of anything.
{104405}{104537}I'm asking you to do a detective search.|Find out from your high- school class
{104549}{104654}if anyone has met a black kid|pretending to be a movie star's son.
{104660}{104735}He promised you parts in Cats?
{104768}{104861}It wasn't just that, it was fun!
{104867}{105013}You went to Cats. You said it was an|all-time low in a lifetime of theatregoing.
{105028}{105130}- Film is a different medium.|- You said "Aeschylus didn't invent theatre
{105136}{105250}to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids|wondering who will go to kitty heaven."
{105259}{105346}- I don't remember saying that.|- That was Starlight Express.
{105355}{105460}Maybe he'll make a movie of that|and you can all be on roller skates.
{105472}{105529}- This is so humiliating!|- So pathetic!
{105538}{105613}- So racist.|- It's not racist!
{105616}{105673}Douglas!
{105679}{105811}- If I remember correctly, you loved Cats.|- I hated it!
{105835}{105966}Here is a copy of your yearbook. Get the|phone numbers of everyone in your class.
{105978}{106068}How can I contact anyone from|high school? I've outgrown them.
{106074}{106152}How can you outgrow them?|You graduated last year.
{106161}{106248}Charge the calls to my phone.
{106257}{106317}- Never!|- This is the KGB!
{106320}{106443}You're always on the phone. Now I ask|you to make calls, you become reticent?
{106455}{106518}This is the entire McCarthy period.
{106521}{106656}- I just wanna get one thing straight.|- Finally we hear from the peanut gallery.
{106665}{106836}You gave him my pink shirt? You gave|a complete stranger my pink shirt?!
{106848}{106934}That shirt was|a Christmas present from you!
{106943}{107066}I treasured that shirt! I loved that shirt!
{107072}{107177}My collar has grown from weightlifting.|You saw my arms had grown,
{107183}{107300}you saw my neck had grown, and you|bought me that shirt for my new body!
{107312}{107456}I loved that shirt! My first shirt for my|new body, and you gave that shirt away?!
{107471}{107627}I can't believe you!|I hate this life, and I hate you!
{107654}{107729}- You never do anything for me!|- You block me.
{107735}{107822}I'm a pathetic extension|of your eighth-rate personality.
{107828}{107899}Social Darwinism|pushed beyond all limits!
{107905}{108022}- You gave him my pink shirt!|- You want me to be all you weren't!
{108034}{108115}You said "drugs" and looked at me?!
{108301}{108376}Oh, God. I know the feeling.
{108385}{108457}When the children turn.
{108466}{108622}- At least we inspired them to take action.|- They hunted through the yearbook.
{108691}{108745}- Oh, my God!|- Did you kiss him?
{108748}{108805}- N... Well, yeah.|- Oh, come on, Tess!
{108814}{108897}- What about that guy? Nah!|- No. No.
{108906}{109008}- No. No, no, no.|- Wait a minute. Trent Conway.
{109020}{109077}(boys) Trent Conway.
{109086}{109185}- Look at those beady eyes.|- Trent Conway. He's at MlT.
{109194}{109263}So I went to MlT.
{109269}{109344}He was there in his computer room.
{109347}{109458}And I just pressed him|and pressed him and pressed him.
{109470}{109515}Yes. I knew Paul.
{109533}{109605}I had this strapped to me.
{109611}{109683}What happened between you?
{109692}{109752}It was...
{109761}{109812}It was...
{109836}{109922}It was... a rainy night in Boston.
{109931}{109997}He was in a doorway.
{110108}{110153}I met him.
{110159}{110246}And I took him back to my place.
{110432}{110495}What's this?
{110501}{110609}- My address book.|- Damn!
{110615}{110774}All these names and addresses.|Tell me about these people.
{110786}{110899}This is where I wanted you to be.|Right here.
{110950}{111064}- Tell me about these people, man.|- I just wanna look at you.
{111070}{111133}Sorry!
{111142}{111286}- Is these all rich people?|- No. Hand-to-mouth. On a higher plateau.
{111298}{111391}You got to be rough|to be with rich people.
{111400}{111547}Gotta have money. You gotta be buyin'|'em presents an' everything all the time.
{111556}{111739}Not at all. When rich people do something|nice for you, you give them a pot of jam.
{111751}{111811}That's what pots of jam is for?
{111817}{111897}Orange. Grapefruit. Strawberry.
{111909}{112074}But fancy. They have entire stores filled|with fancy pots of jam wrapped in cloth.
{112080}{112149}English or French.
{112200}{112347}I tell you what I'm gonna do. I pick|a name, you tell me everything about 'em.
{112353}{112443}Where they live, secrets, everything.
{112479}{112551}And for every name...
{112557}{112635}you get a piece of my clothes.
{112731}{112788}All right.
{112922}{112970}Kittredge.
{112973}{113060}Talbot and Woodrow.
{113111}{113258}Talbot, called "Tess", was anorexic,|and was in a hospital for a while.
{113267}{113330}Oh, really, now?
{113426}{113549}Woodrow, known as "Woody",|has barbells for brains.
{113627}{113690}(blows)
{113693}{113750}They parents.
{113777}{113893}Ouisa and Flan, for "Flanders", Kittredge.
{113902}{113986}Rhode lsland, I believe. Newport.
{113995}{114124}But not along the ocean.|The street behind the ocean.
{114136}{114232}He's an art dealer. They have a Kandinsky.
{114307}{114352}Kan-what-sky?
{114361}{114415}A Kandinsky.
{114424}{114457}Uh...
{114460}{114601}A double-sided Kandinsky.|I feel like Scheherazade! (laughs)
{114790}{114871}I don't want you to leave me, Paul.
{114930}{115068}I'll go through my address book|and I'll tell you about family after family.
{115080}{115158}You'll never not fit in again.
{115197}{115290}We'll even, uh, give you a new identity.
{115296}{115407}I'll make you the most sought-after|young man in the East.
{115416}{115554}And then, one day,|I'll come into one of these homes.
{115563}{115692}And you'll be there.|And I'll be presented to you.
{115701}{115815}And I'll pretend to meet you|for the first time.
{115907}{116009}And our friendship'll|be witnessed by my friends.
{116018}{116102}And our parents' friends.
{116111}{116219}And if it all happens under their noses...
{116225}{116291}they can't judge me.
{116378}{116450}And they can't disparage you.
{116456}{116546}I'll make you a guest in their houses.
{116660}{116732}Now ask me another name.
{116735}{116810}I'd like to try for the shirt.
{117340}{117400}That's enough for today.
{117406}{117481}Paul stayed with me for three months.
{117490}{117556}You remember little Trent Conway?
{117565}{117643}The kid got his address book,|with our names in it.
{117643}{117709}- Yeah. You could be next.|- Yes.
{117718}{117808}Now, this is the way you must speak.
{117817}{117909}Hear my accent. Hear my voice.
{117942}{118080}Now, you never say|you're going horseback riding.
{118095}{118170}- You say you're going riding.|- (grunts)
{118179}{118260}And don't say "couch".
{118269}{118326}Say "sofa".
{118368}{118488}And you, you say "boddill".|"Have a boddill o' beer."
{118494}{118554}It's "bottle".
{118590}{118644}Say "Bottle of beer".
{118674}{118734}Boddill o' beer.
{118779}{118827}Boddill o' beer.
{118830}{118892}Bottle of beer.
{118922}{118973}Boddill of beer. What?
{119006}{119066}Bottle of beer.
{119141}{119216}Bottle... of beer.
{119288}{119363}We went through the address book|letter by letter.
{119366}{119441}Paul vanished by the Ls.
{119447}{119528}He took the address book with him.
{119561}{119669}Well... he's already|been in all your houses.
{119702}{119846}Maybe I will meet him again.|I sure would like to.
{119855}{119995}- His past? His real name?|- I don't know anything about him.
{120010}{120145}It was a rainy night in Boston.|He was in a doorway. That's all.
{120151}{120208}He took stuff from you?
{120214}{120268}Besides the address book?
{120274}{120415}He took my stereo,|my sport jacket, my word processor.
{120427}{120499}And my laser printer.
{120508}{120565}And my skis.
{120622}{120673}And my TV.
{120679}{120766}- Will you press charges?|- No.
{120775}{120844}It's a felony.
{120850}{120954}- Why do they want to find him?|- They say to help him.
{120963}{121065}If there's a crime,|the cops will get involved.
{121077}{121215}We really must keep in touch. We were|really good friends for a brief bit in school.
{121227}{121296}- Really good.|- Won't you press charges?
{121305}{121335}Oh, please.
{121515}{121629}Can you believe it?|Paul learned all that in three months.
{121635}{121815}Who'd have thought it? Trent Conway,|the Henry Higgins of our time.
{121830}{121982}Paul must have looked at all those names|in that book and said "I am Columbus."
{121991}{122120}"I am Magellan.|I will sail into this new world."
{122192}{122282}I read somewhere that|everybody on this planet
{122291}{122399}is separated by only six other people.
{122408}{122540}Six degrees of separation between us|and everyone else on this planet.
{122552}{122735}The president of the United States, a|gondolier in Venice, just fill in the names.
{122795}{122878}I find that extremely comforting|that we're so close,
{122884}{123040}but... I also find it like Chinese water|torture that we're so close,
{123052}{123244}because you have to find the right|six people to make the connection.
{123259}{123331}It's not just big names, it's anyone.
{123337}{123484}A native in a rainforest,|a Tierra del Fuegan, an Eskimo.
{123493}{123574}I am bound - you are bound -
{123583}{123706}to everyone on this planet|by a trail of six people.
{123811}{123906}It's a profound thought.
{123915}{124008}How Paul found us.
{124017}{124209}How to find the man whose son he claims|to be, or perhaps is. Although I doubt it.
{124227}{124377}How everyone is a new door|opening into other worlds.
{124383}{124575}Six degrees of separation between us|and everyone else on this planet.
{124641}{124758}But... to find the right six people.
{124803}{124863}- Hi, Ouisa.|- Hi!
{124869}{124925}- Still going to Rome?|- Tomorrow!
{124928}{125003}- Are you going to the Sistine Chapel?|- It's closed.
{125012}{125096}- Cleaning it.|- When in Rome...
{125105}{125180}You must know these people.
{125219}{125297}- Oh!|- Oh, wonderful.
{125303}{125453}I've always wanted to meet him.|We'll call him just as soon as we get in.
{125998}{126100}(Flan) Rome is always remarkable,|but to see the Sistine Chapel like this!
{126109}{126178}(Ouisa)|To stand at the top of the scaffolding!
{126190}{126298}The colours... are vibrant.
{126307}{126397}We went to Rome on business,|but, thanks to Michelangelo...
{126403}{126514}- I think I have a buyer for that piece.|- I don't think I want to sell.
{126523}{126586}They restored the chapel.
{126595}{126727}They've taken off years of smoke|and tourists, and now it's brand-new.
{126736}{126793}Staggering.
{126829}{126891}But what happened|to Sidney Poitier's son?
{126900}{126987}We put all of that out of our heads.
{127011}{127122}The package would be more lucrative|for you if you included that piece.
{127128}{127197}- I've heard so many stories.|- Like what?
{127206}{127311}- That he stole money and jewellery.|- No! Never!
{127338}{127413}Can we get down to business, please?
{127425}{127476}- Good day.|- Ah!
{127512}{127659}All right. I am humiliated,|but what the hell.
{127701}{127824}The day after we came back from Rome,|we were stepping out of a taxi from lunch.
{127833}{127958}Our doorman, whom we tip at Christmas|and any time he does anything nice for us,
{127970}{128096}our doorman spit at my husband,|J Flanders Kittredge. He spit at him!
{128105}{128162}Thank you, Maurice. Ooh!
{128171}{128258}Darling, they don't|need to know every detail.
{128267}{128342}- I know all about your son.|- What about my son?
{128345}{128441}Not the little shit that lives here.|The secret son.
{128450}{128516}- The Negro son you deny!|- Negro son?
{128525}{128621}The son you make live in Central Park|while you're gallivanting!
{128627}{128711}- Do you have a black son?|- No!
{128759}{128855}This is how rumours|get started and set in cement.
{128861}{128914}- The girl told me everything.|- Who?
{128923}{128971}- She wants her money.|- Who?
{128980}{129103}I'm keeping her in a safe place.|Come, come, come.
{129433}{129496}The next chapter.
{129595}{129685}My boyfriend and I|took a picnic into the park.
{129706}{129784}So, do they have any|black people in Utah?
{129793}{129873}- Maybe two.|- I saw them once. Two black people.
{129885}{129963}The Mormons brought in two.
{129966}{130053}- Do you think it'll hurt me?|- What'll hurt you?
{130059}{130137}My resemblance to Liv Ullmann.
{130185}{130290}She won the all-state competition|for comedy and drama.
{130296}{130374}Really? My gosh!
{130437}{130524}The quality of mercy is not strained.
{130533}{130623}It droppeth like|the gentle rain from heaven.
{130728}{130779}Yeah.
{130782}{130860}And we study. And we wait tables.
{130868}{130931}Cos you have to have technique.
{130937}{130985}Like the painters.
{130994}{131120}Cézanne looked for the rules behind|the spontaneity of Impressionism.
{131129}{131216}- That's a painter?|- We know nothing about painting.
{131225}{131282}My dad loves painting.
{131285}{131390}He has a Kandinsky,|but he loves Cézanne the most.
{131402}{131465}- He lives up there.|- What?
{131468}{131579}Yeah. Count. Six windows down.|On the corner.
{131615}{131696}John Flanders Kittredge.
{131705}{131777}His chums call him "Flan".
{131783}{131911}I was the child of Flan's hippie days.|His radical days.
{131923}{132019}He went down South as a freedom|marcher to register black voters.
{132025}{132118}- You did?|- No!
{132127}{132262}Can't you just see me marching|down South for freedom now?
{132268}{132322}Yes. Yes, I can.
{132334}{132445}His friends were killed.|He met my mother and registered her.
{132451}{132544}Married her in a fit of righteousness,|knocked her up with me,
{132550}{132613}and came back here and abandoned her.
{132622}{132694}You didn't!
{132697}{132745}Flan, shame.
{132754}{132841}He's now a fancy art dealer.
{132888}{132960}Won't see me.
{132966}{133035}The new wife, the white wife,
{133041}{133182}the Louisa-Kittredge-call-me-Ouisa wife,|the mother-of-the-new- children wife...
{133194}{133266}Your brothers and sisters.
{133326}{133464}They go to Andover and Exeter|and Harvard and Yale.
{133473}{133584}The awful thing is,|my father started out good.
{133617}{133737}My mother says "There's a good man|inside J Flanders Kittredge."
{133746}{133877}There is, darling. There is.|Flan thinks he's part of some sinister plot.
{133886}{134030}No, it's all too creepy.|I don't even like to talk about it.
{134075}{134186}He would see you if he's that good.|He can't forget you entirely.
{134192}{134282}- I call him, he hangs up.|- Go to his office.
{134291}{134405}He doesn't have one. He works there.|They won't even let me in the elevator.
{134417}{134525}- Dress up as a messenger.|- Say you got a masterpiece for him.
{134537}{134621}Say "I got the Mona Lisa in the truck."
{134633}{134702}I don't want to embarrass him.
{134708}{134795}Oh, this is so fucking tacky!
{134998}{135070}Do you two love each other?
{135106}{135166}A lot.
{135199}{135235}That's good.
{135241}{135325}- These are nice kids.|- Yeah. They work for a living.
{135331}{135373}(laughter)
{135415}{135556}- I hope we can meet again.|- Yeah. Hey, where do you live?
{135571}{135613}Live?
{135616}{135673}I'm home.
{135679}{135763}You don't live in the streets?
{135769}{135903}You guys are such assholes!|I mean, where would I live?
{135963}{136077}- You can stay with us.|- We just have a flat in a tenement.
{136086}{136182}It's over a roller disco.|The last of the roller discos.
{136188}{136263}But it's quiet by 5am,|and a great narrow space.
{136269}{136413}(girl) You have the couch. The tub is in the|kitchen, but there's light in the morning.
{136422}{136467}- Hello.|- Hello.
{136479}{136509}- Hello.|- Hello.
{136512}{136596}He opened up a whole new world to us.
{136662}{136782}It's all anybody wants, isn't it?|A new world?
{136857}{136982}- You say... you're going riding.|- Riding.
{136991}{137096}And never say "couch". It's "sofa".
{137108}{137150}- Sofa.|- Sofa.
{137153}{137210}And you say "boddill".
{137216}{137315}It's "bottle". Bottle of beer.
{137327}{137405}- Boddill of beer.|- No. Bottle of beer.
{137411}{137465}- Bottle.|- Boddill of beer.
{137474}{137531}Oh. See? Bottle of beer.
{137558}{137672}And never be afraid of rich people.|You know what they love?
{137681}{137750}A fancy pot of jam.
{137756}{137837}Really. That's all.
{137843}{137959}Get a patron. That's what you need.|You shouldn't be waiting tables.
{137971}{138124}You're going to wake up one day, and that|temporary job will be your full-time life.
{138199}{138268}- He stayed with them for...|- Two or three weeks.
{138277}{138331}He sunk his heels in.
{138400}{138484}- I'm moving out of here.|- You can't.
{138490}{138625}My father answered my letter. He's giving|me $1,000, and that's just for starters.
{138637}{138730}He sold a Cézanne to the Japanese|and made millions.
{138742}{138841}Now he can give me money|without her knowing it.
{138847}{138879}I knew it.
{138888}{139041}I'll give you the money to put on any play.|Agents will come. You'll be discovered.
{139050}{139191}And when you win Oscars, both of you,|you'll look in the camera and thank me.
{139200}{139293}- I wanna thank Paul Kittredge.|- Thanks, Paul.
{139302}{139368}(Paul laughs)
{139374}{139509}One hitch - I'm going to meet him|in Maine. He's visiting his parents.
{139521}{139677}My grandparents, whom I've never met.|He's finally gonna tell them about me.
{139689}{139883}Can you see the look on my parents' face|if a black kid showed up? "Hi, Grandma."
{139895}{139976}- Flan, your parents are dead.|- (laughter)
{140018}{140066}He's gonna give me money.
{140069}{140168}I can get my mama that beauty parlour|she's wanted all her life.
{140177}{140288}One problem -|how am I gonna get to Maine?
{140300}{140366}The wife checks all the bills.
{140369}{140486}Where the hell am I going|to get $250 to get to Maine?
{140567}{140624}How long would you need it for?
{140630}{140705}I'll be gone a week.
{140714}{140783}But I could wire it back to you.
{140786}{140875}- We could lend it to him for a week.|- If something happens...
{140884}{140965}You're like his stepmother,|holding the purse strings.
{140974}{141061}No. We worked too hard to save that.
{141124}{141199}I'm sorry, Paul, we just can't.
{141208}{141277}Look, no problem. I understand.
{141283}{141337}- I'll meet you after work.|- Sure.
{141343}{141424}If your dad loves you,|he'll get you the ticket.
{141433}{141496}He does. It'll work out.
{141571}{141721}Hey. Posture. Stand up straight.|Don't slump. Attitudes of defeat.
{141733}{141811}The girl worked just to stay alive.
{141817}{141945}She was one of those armies of people|who come to New York filled with dreams,
{141954}{142098}and end up on a treadmill, working and|working, forgetting why they came here.
{142104}{142260}There must be some mistake. It says my|joint account. Can you see the numbers?
{142272}{142428}That's right. That's my name and his|name, my joint account! Who closed it?!
{142443}{142557}I was furious.|I can't tell you how furious I was.
{142563}{142725}Then I went home to my luxurious|penthouse. And I waited for hours.
{142833}{142895}- Where's the money?|- Hi.
{142901}{143033}Just let me explain.|Paul found some extra money of his own.
{143096}{143207}So he took me to the Rainbow Room.
{143219}{143330}He would've treated you,|only you had to work.
{143339}{143456}We rented these tuxedos. Isn't it a gas?
{143468}{143546}How did we get this table?
{143552}{143618}I know the right names to drop.
{143639}{143816}He's gonna give us the money back. And|then I'm takin' you to the Rainbow Room.
{143831}{143908}I brought you matches.
{144088}{144163}It's not that expensive for what you get.
{144172}{144274}It's not a bargain, but it's worth it.
{144322}{144397}Mm. Wonderful bouquet.
{144403}{144439}"Bouquet"?
{144448}{144565}The taste of wine. Always remember,|the wine from the even-numbered years
{144574}{144670}is superior to the wine from|the odd-numbered years.
{144682}{144796}- Cheers. Skol. Prosit.|- Mud in your eye.
{144805}{144864}You're just about the greatest.
{144909}{145029}- You wanna dance?|- Elizabeth hasn't seen anything like here.
{145035}{145092}I wish she was...
{145125}{145191}Who do we dance with?
{145329}{145389}We're guys.
{145431}{145530}Every moment in life|is a learning experience.
{145539}{145605}Or what good is it? Right?
{145644}{145704}- Right?|- Yes.
{145710}{145776}Then let this bunch of jerks see class.
{145800}{145889}I swear, nothin' like this|ever happened in Utah.
{146087}{146210}Nothin' like that must have ever happened|there cos they asked us to leave.
{146585}{146633}It was so funny!
{146639}{146699}(laughter)
{146735}{146795}Around the park, sir!
{146831}{146875}We don't have any money.
{146887}{147031}Amigo, when will you learn? Money is|the one commodity you can always get.
{147052}{147109}(Paul howls)
{147178}{147229}Hyah!
{147622}{147739}I'm gonna have to explain to Elizabeth|about the money. She gets so nervous.
{147748}{147835}Hey, Paul, come on. Stop that.
{147844}{147930}I was wondering if I could fuck you.
{147990}{148032}I don't do things like that.
{148143}{148203}That's what makes it so nice.
{148212}{148272}You don't.
{148293}{148353}And he did.
{148461}{148518}And it was fantastic.
{148782}{148871}We came here for experience, right?
{148922}{148964}We can use this, right?
{148967}{149069}You're a fool!|Your father is right! You are a fool!
{149078}{149225}We came here for experience. My father|is not right. I can't have him be right.
{149237}{149291}- It's gon...|- Don't touch me.
{149438}{149525}(driver) Hey! Hey!
{149531}{149594}Hey! Come back here!
{149606}{149642}Hey!
{149645}{149684}Argh!
{149702}{149732}Paul!
{149741}{149786}Paul!
{150244}{150313}Look at me.
{150322}{150364}Elizabeth.
{150373}{150550}I didn't come here to do this, or to lose|that, or to be this, or to do this to you.
{150589}{150646}Not to you.
{150691}{150751}Look at me.
{150808}{150939}I couldn't look at him. Spent the night|thinking about having no money.
{150960}{151062}About Paul and his father.|So, this morning...
{151257}{151302}Sir?
{151311}{151419}Sir? I need to get up to see|some people named Kittredge.
{151428}{151485}Are they expecting you?
{151488}{151599}Kittredge has a black son he makes|live in the park who took money from me.
{151608}{151707}- Mr Kittredge has what?!|- His son owes me money!
{151719}{151818}You have to call|and write them a letter. Yes?
{151827}{151961}"Quality of mercy is not strained."|Well, fuck you, quality of mercy!
{151970}{152114}Hey. It's trouble with Mr Kittredge's Negro|son. I take care of it. Don't worry.
{152126}{152279}All over the building that I had abandoned|some mistake of my past in Central Park.
{152288}{152375}- But it's too fantastic.|- It was so embarrassing.
{152384}{152480}- That's horrible.|- It wasn't so embarrassing.
{152486}{152555}I bet Flan loves to be outraged.
{152564}{152657}- I do not!|- You do too!
{152663}{152816}- Flan loves getting into high dudgeon.|- And look at his cheeks turn all rosy.
{152828}{152881}Dudgeon becomes him.
{152887}{152947}To high dudgeon.
{152953}{153055}Now... can we get down to business?
{153262}{153397}Do we have a story for you? We were|at the roller disco two clients opened.
{153409}{153493}I hadn't skated in|I hate to tell you how many years.
{153499}{153646}We came outside giddy and reeling.|And you wouldn't believe what we saw.
{153802}{153930}- The blood hadn't yet reached the gutter.|- It was oozing slowly towards the kerb.
{153939}{154020}The body must have just|landed there in a clump.
{154062}{154167}The boy had just jumped from above.|He could have landed on us.
{154233}{154317}(woman) We just missed it by minutes.
{154413}{154497}Rick! Oh, my God!
{154506}{154563}Rick! Rick!
{154623}{154731}- She'll press charges.|- I want Paul dead.
{154737}{154856}Rick's dead.|You bet your life I'll press charges.
{154871}{154958}We're very sorry.|Is there anything we can do to help?
{154964}{155081}That Paul's a menace. We could|have been killed. Throats slashed.
{155090}{155195}He wasn't going to kill us.|We haven't seen him since that night.
{155201}{155321}- Find him. We might have a case.|- Find him?
{155330}{155435}- How do we find him?|- We could tell the papers. Call The Times.
{155444}{155561}- Ooh, let me. I have friends at The Times.|- I don't wanna know.
{155573}{155636}- They'll publish it.|- Someone will see it.
{155636}{155690}- And turn him in.|- We'll find him.
{155696}{155732}Six degrees.
{155735}{155819}"Who says New Yorkers|don't have a heart?"
{155831}{155947}"Smart, sophisticated, tough New Yorkers,|such as the J Flanders Kittredges,
{155956}{156067}who opened their homes and pocketbooks|to a young man, learned yesterday
{156076}{156223}they had been boondoggled by|a confidence man now wanted by police."
{156229}{156316}- Did you see the piece in The Times?|- We were in Squaw Valley.
{156328}{156469}We came off very well.|I forgot to mention your foundation.
{156478}{156598}You could wallpaper the Empire State|Building with the copies Flan had made.
{156607}{156682}- Come to dinner with us after.|- Can't.
{156688}{156715}- Work.|- Auction.
{156721}{156757}- Matisse.|- Ooh!
{156766}{156885}Oh, no. Matisse on an off day. But our|people are prepared to go to well over...
{156891}{156987}- Don't tell all the family secrets.|- Well over $12,000,000!
{156996}{157071}- Out of which you will keep?|- Not much in these days.
{157077}{157182}- Oh, boy. Bring back the '80s.|- Uh-huh.
{157215}{157350}We'll have to give most of it away. But|it gives us credibility in this new market.
{157362}{157485}It's all outta whack.|Everything's up, everything's down.
{157557}{157632}- Did you ever hear from Poitier's son?|- No.
{157638}{157707}Did you ever hear from the boy?
{157716}{157847}- Oh, we're here to honour your guest.|- But I keep hearing about this story.
{157856}{157931}I heard about it last week in Southampton.
{157937}{158024}- It's amazing.|- No, really. To get the UN to finally...
{158033}{158168}- She can't save the world every day.|- (all laugh)
{158198}{158312}This is my supper,|and I command you to sing.
{158321}{158393}- This is lunch.|- What happened?
{158399}{158561}There is one last chapter,|which happened the other night.
{158570}{158645}Ouisa, may I?
{158660}{158837}The Matisse will be mine|for an hour or so
{158851}{158971}Then, regrettably, it has to go
{158983}{159118}- (Tess) So, what are you wearing?|- I'm totally dolled up. The blue satin.
{159130}{159208}Darling, I have to tell you.|A sign I saw today -
{159220}{159358}"Cruelty-free cosmetics." A store|was selling cruelty-free cosmetics.
{159364}{159412}That is a beautiful thing.
{159418}{159559}Do you realise the agony companies put|rabbits through just to test eye shadow?
{159568}{159628}Oh, darling, I know that.
{159637}{159730}I was referring to the phrase -|"cruelty-free cosmetics".
{159739}{159811}Should eliminate|all traces of time, cellulite...
{159820}{159876}Mother, I'm getting married.
{160002}{160056}You were going to Afghanistan.
{160059}{160158}I'm going to get married,|and then I'm going to Afghanistan.
{160164}{160260}One country at a time.|You're not getting married.
{160269}{160314}lmmediately so negative.
{160320}{160407}I know everyone you know,|and you're not marrying any of them.
{160413}{160503}The arrogance that you assume|you know everyone I know!
{160515}{160599}The way that you say that!|"I know everyone you know."
{160608}{160671}Unless you met them in the last two days.
{160674}{160734}- (phone rings)|- Wait. Hold on.
{160743}{160844}Nobody ever calls on|that number. Mother!
{160874}{160922}Hello?
{160931}{160985}(Paul) Hello?
{161039}{161078}Paul?
{161081}{161141}I saw the story in the paper.
{161147}{161261}I didn't know he killed himself.|He gave me that money. I didn't steal it.
{161270}{161339}I'll put you on hold. I'm talking to my child.
{161348}{161429}Put me on hold and you'll|never hear from me again.
{161441}{161459}Yes...
{161465}{161522}- Mother, can I t...?|- (dialling tone)
{161594}{161705}You have to turn yourself in.|The boy committed suicide.
{161735}{161813}The girl is pressing charges.|You stole that money.
{161819}{161935}Turn yourself in. Make it easy on yourself.|They're gonna get you.
{161947}{162085}Learn when you're trapped.|You have such promise. You need help.
{162112}{162199}- Would you help me?|- What do you want me to do?
{162208}{162259}Stay with you.
{162265}{162322}- That is impossible!|- Why?
{162328}{162379}My husband feels you betrayed him.
{162382}{162430}- Do you?|- You're a lunatic!
{162442}{162610}Picking up that dreck off the street.|Are you suicidal? Do you have AlDS?
{162616}{162673}Are you infected?
{162682}{162790}I don't have it. It's a miracle, but I don't.
{162834}{162966}Do you feel I betrayed you? If you do,|I will hang up and never bother you again.
{163104}{163161}Where have you been?
{163167}{163206}Travelling.
{163209}{163299}Are you in trouble? I mean, more trouble.
{163305}{163368}No. I only visited you.
{163389}{163533}I didn't like the first people so much.|They just went out and left me alone.
{163545}{163644}I didn't like the doctor.|He was too eager to please.
{163653}{163722}And he just left me alone.
{163725}{163830}But you - you and your husband -|we all stayed together.
{163838}{163946}- What did you want from us?|- Everlasting friendship.
{163958}{164015}Nobody has that.
{164018}{164081}- You do.|- What do you think we are?
{164105}{164219}Oh. You're going to tell me secrets?|You're not what you appear to be?
{164228}{164354}You have no secrets. Trent Conway told|me everything your kids have told him.
{164363}{164471}What did our kids tell him about us?
{164510}{164588}I don't tell that. Save that for blackmail.
{164594}{164699}- Perhaps I'd better hang up.|- No!
{164744}{164848}I went to a museum.|I like Toulouse-Lautrec.
{164857}{164923}As well you should.
{164932}{165001}I read the Andy Warhol diaries.
{165007}{165112}I see you're becoming an aesthete.
{165124}{165232}- Are you laughing at me?|- No. I read them too.
{165238}{165349}I've read "The Agony and the Ecstasy"|by Irving Stone, about Michelangelo.
{165364}{165427}Oh, well, you're ahead of me there.
{165430}{165490}Have you seen the Sistine Chapel?
{165499}{165556}Oh, yes.
{165562}{165727}I went right to the top in a rickety old|elevator and watched the men clean it.
{165736}{165831}You've been to the top|of the Sistine Chapel?
{165837}{165927}Stood right under the hand of God|touching the hand of man.
{165939}{165981}Batti! Batti!
{165990}{166017}Oh!
{166020}{166167}One of the workmen said|"Hit it! Hit it! It's only a fresco."
{166182}{166200}Hit!
{166206}{166308}So I did. I slapped God's hand.
{166332}{166410}You... you slapped God's hand?
{166422}{166545}Do you know what they clean it with?|All this modern technology.
{166551}{166599}- Q-Tips and water.|- No!
{166611}{166719}Clean away the years of soot,|grime, paint-overs.
{166725}{166868}Q-Tips and water, changing|the history of Western art. Vivid colour.
{166928}{167033}- Take me to see it.|- Take you to see it?
{167036}{167150}- They think you murdered someone.|- Can you give me a hand with these?
{167162}{167207}- (whispers) Paul.|- Paul?
{167213}{167285}- I'll call that detective.|- (phone rings)
{167291}{167336}Who's that? Hello?
{167345}{167411}- Dad! We were cut off.|- Oh, Tess, hi.
{167417}{167474}- I'm getting married!|- Call back.
{167483}{167552}I'm getting married|and going to Afghanistan!
{167555}{167666}- I can't talk about this...|- I am gonna ruin my life and get married.
{167681}{167783}Throw away everything you want me|to be. It's the only way to hurt you!
{167789}{167863}- (hangs up)|- Jesus.
{167869}{167947}- (phone rings)|- Yeah?
{167953}{168046}- I have that kid on the line.|- Find out where he is.
{168052}{168106}Find out where he is.
{168118}{168208}Um, look, why don't you come here?|Where are you?
{168226}{168280}You'll have the cops waiting.
{168286}{168355}- Tell him he has to trust us.|- You have to trust us!
{168361}{168397}- Why?|- Cos we like you!
{168406}{168481}- We like him? Where is he?|- Who's there?
{168487}{168520}It's, um...
{168523}{168571}- It's Flan!|- Oh, God.
{168580}{168679}Are you in tonight?|I could come and make a feast for you.
{168685}{168787}- No, we're going out tonight.|- Are you crazy?!
{168796}{168885}Tell a crook we're going out,|the house is empty?
{168894}{168936}- Where are you going?|- Sotheby's.
{168939}{169089}- And the key is under the mat.|- Hi! Can I come to Sotheby's?
{169104}{169179}- Shoot! I've lost the detective.|- Paul says hi.
{169182}{169218}- Hi.|- Sotheby's.
{169227}{169290}- Wonderful. I'll come.|- No. You can't.
{169296}{169413}- Why? I was helpful last time.|- You were helpful about the Cézanne.
{169425}{169551}- Really? You know...|- You impressed Geoffrey. Where are you?
{169563}{169677}I was thinking maybe that's what|I should do, is what you do, in art,
{169683}{169806}but making money out of art, meeting|people, and not working in an office.
{169818}{169940}You're just seeing the glamorous side.|There's a whole grotty side that...
{169946}{170000}I could easily learn the grotty.
{170009}{170108}You have to have art history,|language, economics.
{170117}{170201}I'm fast. I could do it.|Do your kids want to?
{170207}{170315}It's not that. It's not a profession|you hand down from gen...
{170324}{170441}What am I doing talking|career counselling to you?!
{170447}{170555}You embarrassed me. You stole money.|There's a warrant for your arrest.
{170564}{170609}- Goddammit!|- No, don't!
{170615}{170711}- I can't believe he sucked me in again.|- You made him hang up.
{170717}{170774}- I'm here.|- You are?
{170792}{170887}Who are you? What's your real name?
{170893}{171004}If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you.
{171013}{171094}That night was|the happiest night I ever had.
{171100}{171163}That was the happiest night he ever had.
{171172}{171331}Oh, please. I'm not a bullshitter,|but never bullshit a bullshitter.
{171367}{171448}Now, get rid of him, Ouisa.
{171454}{171586}You look great, dear. Tonight's|big business. Get him off the phone.
{171598}{171628}Why?
{171634}{171748}You let me use all the parts|of myself that night.
{171757}{171828}That was magical, that Salinger stuff.
{171861}{171933}Graduation speech|at Groton two years ago.
{171969}{172041}Your cooking?
{172050}{172122}Other people's recipes.
{172152}{172233}Did you see Donald Barthelme's obituary?
{172242}{172347}He said that collage was|the art form of the 20th century.
{172356}{172416}Everything is somebody else's.
{172422}{172518}Not your children. Not your life.
{172530}{172566}No.
{172572}{172719}You got me there. That is mine.|That is nobody else's.
{172725}{172794}You don't sound happy.
{172838}{172913}There is so much you don't know.
{172919}{172976}You are so smart.
{172982}{173099}- And so stupid.|- Don't you ever say I'm stupid!
{173108}{173216}Have some flexibility. You're stupid|not to realise what you could be.
{173225}{173276}- What could I be?|- So much.
{173285}{173351}- With you behind me.|- You liked that night?
{173360}{173432}I've thought since|that you were laughing at us.
{173435}{173462}No!
{173471}{173558}You picked up that awful thing|to show us your contempt.
{173567}{173690}I was so happy I wanted to add sex to it.|Don't you do that?
{173798}{173824}No.
{173899}{173959}- I'll tell you my name.|- Please.
{173992}{174076}It's Paul Poitier-Kittredge.
{174085}{174145}It's a hyphenated name.
{174151}{174208}Paul...
{174214}{174265}listen to me.
{174277}{174439}You need help. Go to the police. You'll be|over it all the sooner. You can start...
{174451}{174505}- Start what?|- Your life.
{174514}{174577}Will you help me?
{174622}{174751}I will help you. But first, you have|to go to the police, you have to go to jail.
{174763}{174912}And will you send me books and Polaroids|of you and cassettes and letters?
{174918}{174984}- Yes.|- Will you visit me?
{174996}{175023}I will visit you.
{175026}{175101}And wear your best clothes|and knock 'em dead.
{175107}{175230}I'll knock 'em dead. You have to be|careful in prison. Use condoms.
{175239}{175338}I won't have sex in prison.|I only have sex when I'm happy.
{175344}{175401}- Go to the police.|- Will you take me?
{175410}{175479}I'll give you the name|of the detective to see.
{175491}{175620}I'll be treated with care if you come. If they|don't know you're special, they kill you.
{175626}{175680}I don't think they kill you.
{175686}{175794}Mrs Louisa Kittredge, I am black.
{175853}{175958}I... will deliver you to them,
{175973}{176054}with kindness and affection.
{176072}{176159}I'll plead guilty and go to prison|and serve a few months.
{176162}{176258}- A few months, tops.|- And when I get out, I'll work for you.
{176270}{176411}- No, we'll work all that out.|- No, no, no, no. I want to know now.
{176465}{176564}- You'll work for us.|- Learn the trade, not just the grotty part.
{176573}{176627}- Top to bottom.|- And live with you.
{176633}{176702}- No.|- Why? Your kids are away.
{176714}{176807}- You should have your own place.|- Will you help me find a place?
{176816}{176866}We'll help you find a place.
{176875}{176980}- I have no furniture.|- We'll help you out.
{176989}{177139}I made a list of things I liked at|the museum. Philadelphia Chippendale.
{177145}{177265}Believe it or not, we have two|Philadelphia Chippendale chairs.
{177280}{177373}I'd rather have one nice piece|than a room full of junk.
{177376}{177403}(laughs)
{177409}{177463}Quality always.
{177469}{177595}You'll have all that.|Philadelphia Chippendale!
{177634}{177703}And all I have to do is go to the police.
{177715}{177778}Make it all history.
{177787}{177843}Put it behind you.
{177903}{177981}- Tonight.|- Oh. No, it can't be tonight.
{177993}{178098}I'll take you tomorrow. I have to have|drinks before the auction tonight.
{178107}{178176}- Japanese?|- Germans.
{178185}{178245}You are just like my father.
{178251}{178317}- Which father?|- Sidney!
{178431}{178485}Paul...
{178530}{178581}he's not your father.
{178605}{178662}And Flanders...
{178668}{178725}is not your father.
{178734}{178794}Ouisa, for Christ's sakes!
{178800}{178895}Are you still on the phone?|We have drinks with the Japanese...
{178904}{179012}Is it still that kid? Get him out of our lives!
{179021}{179174}Get him off the phone or I'll rip|the fucking line out of the wall!
{179183}{179228}Paul?
{179237}{179354}I made a mistake. It is not the Germans.|We'll come and get you. Where are you?
{179360}{179450}We'll take you to the police.|They'll treat you with dignity.
{179462}{179507}Um...
{179588}{179681}I'm at the corner of 6th Avenue|and 4th Street.
{179690}{179759}But I'll meet you at|the Waverly movie theatre.
{179768}{179881}- We'll be there in half an hour.|- I'll give you 15 minutes' grace time.
{179887}{179959}We'll be there.
{179971}{180010}Paul...
{180016}{180073}We love you.
{180124}{180154}Ouisa.
{180178}{180262}I love you, Ouisa Kittredge.
{180319}{180346}Hey.
{180352}{180415}Bring a pink shirt?
{180502}{180592}We'll have a wonderful life.
{180793}{180945}We can skip the schmoozing, take the boy|to the police, and be at Sotheby's by nine.
{180960}{180987}Sure.
{180999}{181059}But we hadn't counted on... traffic.
{181068}{181101}(Flan) Traffic.
{181104}{181134}(Ouisa) Traffic.
{181194}{181269}We'd promised Paul|we would take him to the police.
{181278}{181380}(Flan) I called our new best friend,|the detective.
{181392}{181545}Paul! Officer, please! Let us go with him!|We promised we would go with him!
{181554}{181602}- Paul? Paul?|- No, Ouisa.
{181608}{181662}Officer, please. Paul!
{181671}{181770}The Kandinsky is painted on both sides!
{181889}{181997}- There's nothing more you could do.|- (Flan) I didn't think so, no.
{182003}{182093}The next day, Ouisa went to the precinct.
{182153}{182216}Detective Marino, please.
{182216}{182306}- He's transferred.|- Since yesterday?
{182312}{182369}He's transferred.
{182381}{182498}This is about an arrest that was made|yesterday at the Waverly movie theatre.
{182507}{182564}Hold on.
{182612}{182684}This precinct didn't go|to the Waverly theatre.
{182696}{182795}- I didn't imagine it.|- I'm not sayin' you did.
{182801}{182935}- Perhaps you can tell me which precinct...|- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
{182950}{183010}The name?
{183013}{183064}Um...
{183070}{183136}Poitier. Or Kittredge.
{183145}{183163}Uh...
{183169}{183253}- Are you family?|- Not exactly.
{183259}{183394}The detective told me that I could go with|the young man when he was arraigned,
{183403}{183484}so I could tell them that he was... special...
{183490}{183595}We have no record of it. Some other|precinct must have made the arrest.
{183607}{183703}It sounds like your special friend|was wanted for somethin' else.
{183712}{183754}Like what?
{183760}{183918}Lady, how can I help you?|You don't even know your friend's name.
{184083}{184134}Six degrees.
{184191}{184281}We weren't family.|We didn't know Paul's name.
{184302}{184365}I went to the district attorney's office.
{184374}{184479}We weren't family.|We didn't know Paul's name.
{184530}{184680}I called the criminal courts.|I wasn't family. I didn't know Paul's name.
{184776}{184979}I read today that a young man|committed suicide in Rikers lsland prison,
{184991}{185138}and tied a shirt around his neck|and hanged himself.
{185180}{185243}Was it the pink shirt?
{185246}{185327}A burst of colour. Pink shirt.
{185387}{185495}Was it Paul? We never did|find out who he was.
{185504}{185564}I'm sure it wasn't him.
{185570}{185660}- Yes, I agree.|- Isn't it amazing?
{185669}{185792}We haven't seen the last of him,|believe me. He'll be back. He'll find a way.
{185798}{185848}The imagination... Oh!
{185896}{186025}- Why does it mean so much to you?|- He wanted to be us.
{186028}{186094}Everything we are in the world.
{186106}{186268}This paltry thing, our life, he wanted it.|He stabbed himself to get into our lives.
{186277}{186376}He envied us.|We're not enough to be envied.
{186385}{186463}Like the papers said, we do have hearts.
{186469}{186529}Having a heart is not the point.
{186538}{186664}We were hardly taken in.|We believed him for a few hours.
{186673}{186805}He did more for us in a few hours|than our children ever did.
{186840}{186918}And he wanted to be your child.|Don't let that go.
{186924}{187047}He sat out in that park and said|"That man is my father."
{187059}{187134}He's in trouble, and we don't|know how to help him.
{187140}{187293}Help him? My God! We could|have been killed. Throats slashed.
{187308}{187365}You were attracted to him.
{187371}{187485}Oh, please. Cut me out|of that pathology right now.
{187497}{187566}Attracted by his youth, his talent,
{187572}{187659}and the embarrassing prospect|of being in the movie of Cats.
{187668}{187746}Well... that, yes. Yes.
{187752}{187814}Did you put that in your Times piece?
{187826}{187979}And we turn him into an anecdote|to dine out on, like we're doing right now!
{187991}{188129}But it was an experience.|I will not turn him into an anecdote.
{188138}{188216}How do we keep what happens to us?
{188222}{188354}How do we fit it into life|without turning it into an anecdote?
{188366}{188465}With no teeth, and a punch line|you'll mouth over and over for years.
{188474}{188558}"Oh, that reminds me of that impostor."
{188570}{188648}"Oh, tell the one about that boy."
{188654}{188789}And we become these human jukeboxes,|spilling out these anecdotes.
{188804}{188893}But it was an experience.
{188896}{188980}How do we keep the experience?
{189160}{189217}That's why I love paintings.
{189226}{189370}Cézanne, the problems he brought up then|are the problems painters still deal with.
{189379}{189436}Colour. Structure.
{189442}{189499}Those are problems.
{189502}{189622}There is colour in my life,|but I'm not aware of any structure.
{189637}{189709}What are you saying, darling?
{189772}{189876}Cézanne would leave|blank spaces in his canvases
{189882}{189981}if he couldn't account|for the brush stroke...
{189987}{190080}couldn't... give a reason for the colour.
{190092}{190215}Then I am a collage|of unaccounted-for brush strokes.
{190227}{190311}I... am all...
{190320}{190365}random.
{190371}{190446}- Excuse me.|- Ouisa!
{190452}{190521}- Do sit down!|- Excuse me, please.
{190530}{190578}Ouisa!
{190758}{190832}What kind of behaviour is this?
{190838}{190925}God, Flan, how much of your life|can you account for?
{190934}{191057}Are you drunk? What's wrong with you?|Don't you realise how important she is?
{191066}{191183}Why are you unhappy? The Cézanne|sale went through, and the Matisse.
{191189}{191267}We're rich - enough.|Next month there's a Bonnard.
{191276}{191390}These are the times I could take a knife|and dig out your heart. How much of...
{191396}{191492}..my life can I account for?! All of it!
{191579}{191651}I am a gambler.
{191657}{191738}We're a terrible match.
{192879}{192951}(Paul) The Kandinsky.
{192957}{193053}The Kandinsky's painted on two sides.
{193551}{193728}(workman) Batti! Batti!|Tanto siamo al fresco. Hit it!

Welcome to Gattaca.
You keep your workstation so clean.
- It's next to godliness.
- Godliness ...
I reviewed your flight plan. Not one error in a million keystrokes.
Phenomenal. It's right that someone like you is taking us to Titan.
Has the committee approved the mission? There's talk of delay.
You shouldn't listen to talk.
You leave in a week.
You've got a substance test.
If you have to take a substance test, report to the testing centre.
Jerome. Never shy.
Pisses on command.
- A beautiful piece of equipment.
- You tell me every time I'm here.
I see a great many in my job.
Yours happens to be exceptional.
Why didn't my folks order one like that for me?
- Have I ever told you about my son?
- No.
Remind me to, sometime.
So you're about to go up.
One week left.
Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Congratulations, Jerome.
Thank you.
How many launches are there in a day? A dozen?
- Sometimes more.
- Only you watch every one of them.
If you're going to pretend like you don't care, don't look up.
The most unremarkable of events.
Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class, is about to embark -
- on a one-year manned mission to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn.
This highly prestigious assignment was guaranteed Jerome at birth.
He has all the gifts required.
A genetic quotient second to none.
There's nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow.
Except that I am not Jerome Morrow.
I was conceived in the Riviera.
Not the French Riviera.
The Detroit variety.
They used to say that a love child has a greater chance of happiness.
They don't say that any more.
I don't know why my mother trusted God -
- rather than her local geneticist.
Ten fingers, ten toes, that's all that used to matter... Not now.
Only seconds old, the ex act time and cause of my death was known.
Neurological condition, 60%, manic depression, 42% probability.
Attention deficit disorder,
89% probability. Heart disorder ...
... 99% probability.
Early fatal potential.
- Life expectancy: 30.2 years.
- 30 years?
- The name for the certificate?
- Vincent Anton.
That's a good name.
I know he'll do something.
You'll do something.
I quickly thought of myself as others did. Chronically ill.
Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as a fatal threat.
The insurance won't cover it. If he fell ... There's nothing I can do.
Like most other parents then, they wanted their next child -
- to be conceived in what has become the natural way.
Your extracted eggs, Marie, -
- have been fertilized with Antonio's sperm.
We have screened two healthy boys and two very healthy girls.
Without predispositions to any inheritable diseases.
Let's select the most compatible candidate. What gender do you want?
We would want Vincent to have a brother to play with.
You have specified hazel eyes, dark hair and ... fair skin.
I've eradicated prejudicial conditions:
Premature baldness, alcoholism, propensity for violence, obesity.
We didn't want ...
Diseases, yes, but ...
We would like to leave a few things to chance.
Give your child the best start. We have enough imperfection built-in.
Your child doesn't need any additional burdens. It's still you.
Simply the best of you.
You could conceive naturally 1,000 times and never get such a result.
That's how Anton came to be.
A son worthy of my father's name.
- I'm proud of you, son.
- See how much he's grown.
When we played blood brothers -
- I understood my blood was very different from Anton's.
I'd need a lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere.
We played chicken.
When our parents weren't watching -
- we'd swim as far out as we dared and see who'd turn back first.
Come on, you coward!
Of course it was always me.
Anton was the stronger swimmer and had no excuse to fail.
300 million,
350 million, 400 million.
Maybe it was my love of the planets or just my dislike for this one, -
- but for as long as I remember
I've dreamed of going into space.
750 million,
800 million, 850 million.
How many astronauts are there?
I bet I could be one if I wanted.
Don't eat that. It's Pluto.
My goals didn't change a lot.
Much to my parents' dismay.
Vincent ...
Be realistic. With a heart condition like yours ...
- There's a chance my heart's fine.
- One chance in 100.
- I'll take it.
- They won't.
You've got to understand something.
You'll only get inside a spaceship to clean it.
He was right. I lied on my resume, but my real resume was my cells.
Why waste money on training me -
- when there are 1, 000 other applicants with a cleaner profile?
It is illegal to discriminate.
"Genoism", it's called.
But no one takes the law seriously.
If you refuse to tell, they take a sample from a door handle -
- or a handshake. Even the saliva on your application form.
A legal drug test can become-
- an illegal peek at your future in the company.
Sure you want to do this?
You know you're going to lose.
It was the last time we swam together. Out into the open sea.
Knowing each stroke out was one we'd have to make back.
But something was different. Every time Anton tried to pull away -
- he found me right beside him.
Until finally the impossible happened.
Vincent!
For once in our lives Anton was not as strong as he believed -
- and I was not as weak. That made everything else possible.
Like others in my situation I moved around getting work where I could.
I must've cleaned half the toilets in the state.
The underclass wasn't determined by social status or skin colour now.
- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- Today discrimination is a science.
There's your cleaning material.
Start here and clean to the back.
I want to see my smiling face on that floor.
Dreaming of space, Your Majesty?
Come here.
Start by cleaning this space.
I knew how far away I was from my goal when I stood right beside it.
- Don't clean the glass too well.
- What do you mean?
You might get ideas.
But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier to see me on the other side.
I knew it was just brave talk.
No matter how much I studied, -
- the best test score in the world needs a blood test to match it.
I had to go to extreme measures.
The man who came didn't exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages.
Stand straight.
- How did you hear about me?
- People.
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birth marks?
No.
Are you serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.
- I'd give 100%.
- That'll get you halfway there.
That's an old edition, but I know it all by heart.
- The commitment is binding.
- You have somebody in mind?
For the genetic elite, success is attainable, but not guaranteed.
There is no gene for fate.
And when a member of the elite falls on hard times -
- their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity.
One man's loss is another's gain.
He's got impeccable credentials.
An unbelievable expiration date.
He'll practically live forever.
His IQ is off the register.
Better than 20/20 vision. Strong heart. He could run through a wall.
If he could still run.
He was a big-time swimming star.
You could go anywhere with this guy's DNA tucked under your arm.
- You look so right together.
- We don't look anything alike.
Nobody looks at photos today.
Christ, you could have my face.
- How do I explain the accident?
- It happened out of the country.
No one knows he broke his back. He's still a fully productive citizen.
- Just fill in his last year.
- You're a foreigner.
They don't care where you were born.
Blood has no nationality.
As long as it's got what they want, it's the only passport you'll need.
- Who lives up there?
- Well, I certainly don't.
The process of becoming him began.
Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth.
- Isn't there another way?
- Surgery will leave scars.
It's contact lenses or a white cane.
- Besides, the colour doesn't match.
- He's right.
My eyes are prettier.
I take 25% of all you make.
If it fails, all this equipment must be returned in seven days.
- And you lose your deposit.
- Wait! You said 20%.
- It's not negotiable.
- I guess that's it.
- No. There's still the height.
How tall were you before the accident?
- His profile says he's 6' 1 ".
- I can wear lifts.
Even with lifts you're not that tall.
So what?
No ...
- We never discussed that.
- I thought you were serious.
I am. I'm not doing that.
No.
Now Jerome knew I was committed.
I endured the pain by reminding myself that when I did stand up -
- I'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Do you want to go dancing?
You had to be a right-hander.
No one orders southpaws any more.
Jerome Morrow. It's a nice name.
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.
What makes you think you can be me at all?
Look at this.
- Look at it.
- It's nice.
- Is it real?
- Are you colour-blind? It's silver.
Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium.
With all I had going for me,
I was still second best.
Me!
So how do you expect to pull it off?
I don't know, exactly.
Your signature needs work.
Soon we were put to the test.
Jerome had the genes to get into Gattaca, but not the desire.
- Do you really want to be in there?
- Not in there. Up there.
- What's up there?
- That's want I want to see, Jerome.
Call me Eugene. My middle name.
If you're going to be Jerome, you better start getting used to it.
- I must go. Where's my sample?
- In the fridge. Door on the left.
- Which pouch?
- Any of them.
- You think I should test it?
- If you like.
- What's wrong with the machine?
- You've been drinking again!
- I haven't.
- Christ, it's eight in the morning!
This is no joke.
My interview is in an hour!
- There's more vodka than piss!
- I had half a glass to celebrate.
- Friday's will be all right.
- There's only Wednesday left.
That's the one.
It's not too late to back out.
This is the last day you will be you and I will be me.
Well?
- Congratulations.
- What about the interview?
That was it.
I got it.
Of course you got it.
Each day I would dispose of all my loose skin, nails and hair.
To limit how much of my In- Valid self I'd leave in the Valid world.
Eugene prepared samples of his body matter so I'd pass for him.
Urine for the substance tests.
Blood for the security checks and vials filled with other traces.
Eugene gave me his identity while I paid the rent -
- and kept him in the style to which he'd become accustomed.
Eugene had never been called
"utero", "faith birth", "In- Valid".
As a "Valid", he suffered under the burden of perfection.
I was now a member of a new and detested segment of society.
One of those who won't accept their fate. A "borrowed ladder".
Or... a "de-gene-erate".
In the guise of Jerome Morrow
I've risen quickly in Gattaca.
Only one of the mission directors has come close to exposing me.
He may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life.
I think we can rule out suicide.
Thank you.
This will take a while.
We may have to push things back.
Irene, I want you to assist the investigators.
- That would put me behind.
- I appreciate your sacrifice.
- I won't lose my place in line?
- Your place is assured.
So kindly inform the authorities we will cooperate in any way, -
- although we can't tolerate a major disruption.
- Thank you, Irene.
- Thank you, Director.
- How will this affect the mission?
- We'll go ahead as planned.
The launch can only be this week.
Tragic though this event may be, it hasn't stopped the planets turning.
- What happened?
- I'm going up.
- End of the week.
- That soon?
- What about the mission director?
- He's dead.
Are you serious?
They found him beaten so badly they had to check his name tag.
You are serious.
There's nothing between us and ignition.
I'm going up.
- The man was murdered?
- I didn't do it.
- It'll be crawling with Hoovers.
- I'll handle the J. Edgars.
What if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.
We have to get drunk immediately.
Good evening, gentlemen. I hear you're leaving us, Mr. Morrow.
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?
Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.
How old is the specimen?
- I kissed him five minutes ago.
- I'll see what I can do.
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.
Good luck.
- 9.3. Quite a catch.
- Yes. Quite a catch.
God, I've told Cavendish ... This has only been open five minutes!
Wine needs to breathe.
They say being weightless is the closest thing to being in the womb.
I can't believe you pulled this off.
They're sending you up there.
Up there! You, of all people.
You'll be alone in that room for a year.
- It's bigger than your tin can.
- What are you going to do?
I have my books.
I travel in my head.
I wish you had company.
Someone you didn't have to pay for.
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What are you going to do?
I'm going to finish this.
What's Titan like this time of year?
What's Titan like?
Titan is exactly like this.
The cloud around it is so thick, no one can tell what's underneath.
- Maybe there's nothing there.
- There's something there.
- You should be going, not me.
- Why is that?
Because up there your legs wouldn't matter.
I'm scared of heights.
I'm sorry.
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?
I'm so sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.
- Come on! Help!
- I'm sorry.
I wasn't drunk ...
... when I walked in front of that car.
I stepped right out in front of it.
I'd never been more sober, ever.
- Go to sleep.
- I couldn't even get that right.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
Go to sleep.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
You must be drunk to call me Vincent.
- How much do you need?
- 20 minutes.
You can go.
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.
We found our man. It's the only specimen we can't account for.
- Every 10 years things go our way.
- Tell me about the eyelash.
An unregistered In-Valid. A janitor.
He disappeared a few years back.
- The specimen could be from then.
- Nothing lies around here for long.
Would a janitor come back after so long to kill a man he never knew?
His profile suggests he's violent.
It also suggests he's a sick man.
There's a 90% chance he's dead.
That leaves a 10% chance he's still alive.
The owner of the eyelash is the murderer. I'll do a cross-check ...
- He has no living relatives.
- That's a damn shame, sir.
Check the entry log.
Alibis, grudges.
I see a lot of dry eyes. The mission director was not universally loved.
He was leading cutbacks in the programme.
With all due respect, sir ...
Whatever you say.
Jerome the metronome.
I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his.
- We have a suspect.
- That is a relief. Who is he?
We found an unaccounted-for specimen. Here's his picture.
- An In-Valid.
- We're still following other leads.
- I'm posting this immediately.
- I'm curious, Director.
An advantage, I should imagine, in your line of work.
- Your hiring practices ...
- Our "recruitment philosophy".
- Who do you have to be, to be here?
- We don't take common citizens.
Are they all equally excellent?
Occasionally we've had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings.
But nothing that would stop them joining the police, for example.
Now, there are enough of the right kind to warrant a new standard.
Bodies with minds to match.
Essential, as we push out further.
- Yet you still monitor performance.
- To see they meet their potential.
- And exceeding it?
- No one exceeds his potential.
If he did, we just didn't accurately gauge his potential right off.
- All right?
- Terrific.
The entry log for the past week.
What about you, Irene?
Do you have an alibi?
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.
I'll take care of that for you, Mr. Morrow.
I see I'm not the only one who looks up every time there's a launch.
- It's awful about the director.
- Awful it didn't happen sooner.
Didn't he threaten to cancel your mission? Somebody did you a favour.
- Do they know who I should thank?
- They found an eyelash.
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.
Jerome ...
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.
I'm sorry.
Seems you're everything they say you are and more.
You're engineered just like the rest of us.
Not quite.
"Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure." That's how they put it.
The only trip I'll take in space is around the sun on this satellite.
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from where I stand.
If you don't believe me ...
Here. Take it.
If you're still interested, let me know.
I'm sorry. The wind caught it.
Please check the latest Gattaca bulletin.
Jerome. Is this the approach path we discussed?
- Absolutely, Director.
- Quite right.
Listen, I want what I ordered.
It's a completely different colour.
No. I'm bored of talking to you.
I'll call you back.
That was about your hair dye.
They've sent me "Summer Wheat".
It's too light.
"Why don't you try a change?"
We can't use it!
- I'll probably have to pay for it.
- We can't stay here.
- The idiots I have to deal with ...!
- They think I killed the director.
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.
- Where?
- In the corridor.
Thank God it wasn't in your eye.
My picture is everywhere. I can't turn around without seeing my face.
- They'll recognize me. They will!
- I don't recognize you.
They won't accept one of their elite could've suckered them for so long.
No, we do as we planned. You're
Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class.
I'm not Jerome Morrow.
I'm a murder suspect.
What are you doing?
That's more than a day's worth!
- We can't stay here.
- Stop that! Fine ... fine!
Leave if you want. But don't take that stuff. It's mine!
I would've chosen a brave partner -
- if I'd known you'd go belly-up on me at the last gasp.
You can't quit on me now.
Do you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?
- They are going to find me.
- You still don't understand ...
When they look at you, they don't see you any more. Only me.
Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.
How could you be so careless?
- I'm going out.
- Where?
I want some fun before they nail me.
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- You said not to change anything.
- Who's going?
- I'd say everybody.
If I don't go it'll look suspicious.
You don't want to look suspicious, do you?
Thanks.
Who ordered this?
What are we doing here?
I'm following a lead. Forgive me, but I'm a detective. I follow leads.
- Why should the suspect be here?
- He's an In-Valid.
- This is where the In-Valids are.
- He's an In-Valid.
He's been in hiding all these years.
You think he'll lie down for us now?
- What do you suggest?
- Go back to the scene.
Sweep the area around Gattaca.
- You're a navigator? At Gattaca?
- That's what it says, doesn't it?
- It doesn't say you're crippled.
- I hurt my leg training, you moron.
How dare you question me?
What's your number?
- Your number, you fucking flatfoot!
- What do you want? An apology?
It gets to you that I can live your dreams. I'm leaving this dirtball!
- You're harassing me!
- My mistake.
What's your number?
This is a crime scene.
What's this man doing here?
- What are you doing, old man?
- My job, sir.
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.
You didn't know?
Wonderful, wasn't it?
12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.
That piece can only be played with 12.
- What's all this about?
- It's probably nothing.
No. I don't want to give you a contaminated specimen. Get it?
Thanks. You never know where those swabs have been.
I want to show you something.
Come on, we'll miss it.
Come on. We'll miss it.
What did I tell you?
Strange. Your eyes look different.
- I guess it must be the light.
- Must be.
Positive match. I'm impressed.
- The cup was used recently?
- Two samples, two days.
He may have returned to the crime scene to get a drink of water.
- Or he may still work there.
- We checked all the service staff.
I don't think he cleans any more.
I think he's there in disguise.
- A borrowed ladder at Gattaca?
- Far-fetched, but not impossible.
He can't be among the elite. He's mentally and physically inferior.
Maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out.
Let's sample every employee intravenously.
We'd close them down for days. No, take a fingertip or a urine sample.
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.
It's only a matter of time, sir.
What's with the plungers, Lamar?
You open up a blood bank?
The detectives fear my methods may have been compromised.
- Goddamn! Are you out of practice?
- Let me look at that.
- It's all right.
- Luckily, we have enough.
If you need any more, you can get it off his shoes.
Irene.
- So you didn't do it after all?
- I guess someone beat me to it.
I guess.
I leave in two days.
I guess you know that. But ...
That's the last.
- Something's wrong.
- He's not here.
- I say we test again.
- No. No more disruptions.
- You have a murderer in your midst.
- Your presence is more of a threat.
The window for our latest launch is open for seven days every 70 years.
- It's crucial we leave on time.
- This mission means a lot to you.
Your late colleague opposed it.
Take another look at my profile.
I haven't a violent bone in my body.
My apologies.
He won't trouble you any further.
This is not the only place we can look.
Let's start making the rounds.
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.
- I know something about that.
- What heart problem have you had?
Did you get yours broken once?
I had this crazy idea you were more interested in the murder than in me.
You're right.
That's a crazy idea.
Would you like to dance?
It's funny. You work so hard to get away from a place ...
And when you finally get to leave, you find a reason to stay.
- A year is a long time.
- Not so long.
Just once around the sun.
Hello, I'm your detective for the evening. Please stay here.
Don't leave! Am I speaking in some strange foreign language?
Check lenses, dentures, napkins, cigarette butts, saliva off cups.
That's a familiar face.
Check him out.
- I thought you wanted to dance.
- Where are you going?
Jerome!
- Are you insane?
- Come on!
Where did they go?
Come on.
- I can't do that!
- You just did.
Don't touch your face.
Don't swallow. Clean his teeth.
Vincent!
Vincent!
Who's Vincent?
I ...
Don't say anything.
Don't say anything.
What happened?
The scars on your legs?
Remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?
I bumped into the front fender.
Looked left instead of right.
- Is that the new or the old excuse?
- The old one.
- You are involved with the murder.
- That's not true, Irene.
Isn't that the man from last night?
He's nobody.
He's one of our best. He has nothing to do with this business.
Jerome Morrow.
You don't look well, Jerome.
Why don't you go home?
- Yes?
- Jerome Morrow.
He's ill. A little nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.
I want to visit him. I understand you can show me the way.
You don't know who he is, do you?
- Hello?
- Be yourself today.
- I was never very good at it.
- Tell the investigators you're ill.
- How long have I got?
- Not long.
I guess he's not home.
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.
- That's me. Come up.
I guess he's home.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
Hello, sweetheart.
Where's my kiss?
- Good to see you're feeling better.
- Of course, now that you're here.
Who's your friend? How can I help?
- It's about the director.
- Again?
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No, no.
- I won't show you around. Sorry.
- Can't we do this another time?
- This won't take a moment.
- Maybe he can tell me why I'm ill.
Who were you expecting?
- We have our man in custody.
- I'll come right away.
- How are you, Jerome?
- Not bad, Jerome.
- How the hell did you get up here?
- I can walk. I've been faking it.
Irene ...
Don't touch me!
I don't even know who you are.
- I'm the same as I was yesterday.
- No more lies, Jerome.
My name is Vincent Anton Freeman.
I'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate or whatever. But I'm not a murderer.
- You're a God-child?
- We do have one thing in common.
Only I don't have 20-30 years left in mine. It's 10,000 beats overdue.
- It's not possible.
- You know what isn't possible.
Don't you, Irene?
They've got you looking so hard for any flaw, that that's all you see.
For whatever it's worth, I'm here to tell you that it is possible.
It is possible.
Congratulations, sir. His spit was found in the dead director's eye.
While I obsessed over an eyelash, your instincts pointed the way.
So the In-Valid wasn't involved?
No, our friend acted alone. This mission meant everything to him.
He'll only live to see this launch.
Since nothing can stop the launch now, he's very, very cooperative.
- So, will you celebrate tonight?
- Of course.
- I think she likes us.
- In time she'll get used to it.
- What was he like?
- Just a cop.
- Did you get his name?
- No.
- He'll be back.
- They have their man. It's over.
No, it's not. I have to meet him.
Vincent?
My God, you have changed.
- Don't you recognize your brother?
- Are we brothers?
Our parents died thinking they'd outlived you. I had my doubts.
- What are you doing here?
- I have a right to be here.
- You don't.
- You sound as if you believe that.
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.
You committed fraud. You're in trouble. I can get you out of here.
- I've struggled to get here!
- You've gone as far as you can go.
There's still a million miles to go.
Can you only succeed by seeing me fail?
God! Even you are going to tell me what I can and can't do now?
I don't need any rescuing.
But you did, once.
- How do you explain that?
- You didn't beat me. I beat myself.
- Who are you trying to convince?
- Do you want me to prove it?
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.
I'll prove it to you.
Do you want me to prove it?
I do.
Vincent!
Vincent! Where's the shore?
We're too far out!
Do you want to quit? Do you?
No.
Vincent!
How are you doing this, Vincent?
How have you done any of this?
We have to go back.
- No. We're close to the other side.
- Do you want to drown us both?
You want to know how I did it?
This is how I did it. I never saved anything for the swim back.
You couldn't see, could you?
That night, crossing the street.
You crossed anyway.
If you're still interested, let me know.
Sorry ...
The wind caught it.
You're flying today, aren't you?
Look at what a mess you're in.
- I have your samples ready.
- I don't need any where I'm going.
You might when you get back.
Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.
- Why have you done all this?
- So Jerome will always be here.
- Where are you going?
- I'm travelling, too.
- I don't know how to thank you.
- No, no ...
I got the better end of the deal.
I only lent you my body.
You lent me your dream.
Not until you're upstairs.
- What is this?
- New policy.
- Flight got you nervous?
- There's a problem, Lamar.
I never did tell you about my son, did I? He's a big fan of yours.
Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most.
- He wants to apply here.
- I could have gone up and back.
Unfortunately, my son's not all that they promised.
But then, who knows what he could do?
Right?
For future reference, right-handed men don't hold it with their left.
Just one of those things.
You're going to miss your flight,
Vincent.
For someone who was never meant for this world, -
- I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it.
Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star.
Maybe I'm not leaving.
Maybe I'm going home.

- Chuck D is the bomb, boy.
- What?
Get the fuck outta here.
Chuck D ain't shit.
That nigger Chuck D is assed out, and the rest of Public Enemy.
Speech, motherfucker. What about him?
Speech? He a bitch-ass nigger.
How the fuck this thing gonna say
Chuck D the hardest rapper?
- Nigger ain't never shot nobody.
- You gotta be hard nowadays!
First, I know niggers ain't slappin' bitches up.
They ain't takin' pussy.
Niggers ain't shootin' up, ain't done time for murder.
How the fuck they hard?
Do what you gonna do. I ain't buyin' shit that ain't hard-core.
You ain't gotta shoot nobody to prove you're hard-core.
- What kinda shit is that?
- Hold on.
Only niggers I have representin' is my man Tupac, G-Rap and Wu-Tang.
- Motherfuckin' Dr Dre, straight up.
- You said it. No fuckin' around.
Niggers talkin' all this positive shit.
Motherfuckin' world ain't positive.
That's why motherfuckin' sex and violence sell more records.
I like positive rappers, get it?
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Them niggers ain't homeboys.
Put them poor-ass niggers over there.
Come on, come on, yo, yo.
Forget that shit, man.
We gots to be about business.
And, Go, you ain't supposed to be over here.
Get your ass over there!
You supposed to be on the lookout.
- This ain't no joke.
- It's hot outside, man.
We gots to get that money.
I understand that, too, but it's hot, man.
Psst!
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man? How ya doin'?
- It's cool.
- What you need?

# Always in the news
# Toughness is their motto
# And bitter are their blues... #
Open your fuckin' mouth.
Lift up your fuckin' tongue.
Lemme see under your tongue. Open.

(Strike ) That's Darryl.
That's Darryl Adams, the thief.

Nice indoors work, huh, Darryl?

If I'm so much your son, why my black ass always on them benches?

Had this dream last night.
I'm standin' in the desert with all my kids.
My for-real kids, my kids from the store.
They's all laid out in front of me like they's my army.
God comes up, points at you.
Tells me, "This one right here is gonna be your sword and your staff."
God, man. God said that.
He pointed right at you.
Darryl Adams wasn't even in the motherfuckin' dream, cos that boy's a thief, and he got to be got.

You know Errol gave hisself the Big "A".

My man messed around and took that "A" train.
Anyway, can you see Errol in there, sellin' whale on a bun and ounces and fries?
Nah.
Strike, you really want to get off the benches?
You deal with it... for me.

Cos, yo, he beat up this honey Charise, man.
She's only 16, kid.

This nigger took her to the back office, talkin' 'bout "slob my johnson".
And when she said no, he started slappin' her up and shit.
Yo, the brother's foul.

A dope-dealin' woman beater.
Man, I don't know about all that.

Her moms is mad stressed out about that shit.

Yo, black, we closed.
Besides, I thought you don't eat this shit because it fucks with your stomach.

Boom! Gotcha!
Boom. Gotcha.
You still here, motherfucker?
What's up?
Mylanta! We need more Mylanta out here for this girl!
(Laughing) Boom!
Probably a fuckin' triple-header.
Outdoors in the mud,
60 casings around, and a big herd of Nubians stepping all over everything, man.
- Alla salute.
- Mazel tov.
Ahh! I just don't like them aeroplane bottles.
What the fuck happened?
- Oh, that boy got shot up!
- Who did?
I wouldn't know. I wasn't here, so
I can't talk intelligently about it.
Yo, uh... I wouldn't want you not to talk intelligently.
(Man) The body cold already.
Excuse me. Coming through. Thank you.
Hey! Welcome to the show that never ends.
Bartucci, what you got?
We got a black male, dead man.
Darryl Adams, 22 years old.
He's the night manager of this joint.
Kid's standin' by the door having a conversation with another male.
Pop, pop, poppity-pop.
Darryl goes down.
Shooter does a Carl Lewis.
Neighbourhood says there's four shots fired.
At this point, that's all she wrote.
- Robbery?
- Nah. Way too fast.
Drugs? Was he a scumbag?
To tell you the truth,
I never seen this kid before.
Boys, Darryl Adams.
Darryl Adams, the boys.
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hello in there.
(Cop) Live by the gun, die by the gun.
- The kid had brains.
- Good thing he was wearin' his gold.
Bing, bing, bing. Ricochet Rabbit.
I still think it was the food here.
Hal, get in there, tell me what you got.
There she blows.
Let's see.
No powder burns on the face.
- These eyes have lied.
- Looking about 30, 35 years old.
- Doors one and two.
- OK, let's see.
Nothin' up the sleeve.
He might get better, but he ain't never gettin' well.
- And presto!
- Hey, slapped him five.
On the light hand side.
Hey, look at that. Looks like some kind of an Egyptian peace sign.
You're right there. It says goodbye.
Hey, Moe. My main man.
Gonna need prints off that door.
Fuck you, Rocco.
That'll really narrow it down(!)
We'll get half the yos in Brooklyn off this door.
- What, did you eat at Ahab's Burger?
- Yeah.
- You owe me six more.
- I love my job, too.
More prints than my ex-wife.
- He wearing any?
- Be with you in a second.
Must be his golf jacket.
It's got 18 holes.
Oh, Christ!
What the fuck did he eat?
# Come out, come out, wherever you are
# The monkey's on the trolley car #
Looks like they did come out.
Here's one. Two. Two exits.
What's the grapevine say?
What they always say.
"We keep our ear to the grindstone."
- Was he clockin'?
- I don't know.
- Hal, how ya doin'?
- How ya doin', Lar.
- Check the pockets.
- Yeah.
Son of a bitch! That's Darryl Adams!
(Rocco ) Who?
He worked in Rodney's candy store.
I saw him a lot.
If he worked for Rodney, he was clockin'.
- Hal, check the pockets again.
- Sure. Hold on.
- Nothin'.
- What's up, Darryl?
Clockin' like a motherfucker, man.
(Man) You guys done yet?
Ho! Marvello the magician!
- Catch a bullet with his teeth.
- (Rocco ) What a catch!
- What a smile.
- Darryl, you've outdone Willie Mays.
You got my vote for MVP.
Another stain on the sidewalk, huh?
(Detective ) Get a pail and a mop.
Get it over with.
One, two, three.
Arrivederci!
All right. Show's over!
Officers, send 'em home!
- See ya, Hal.
- Take care.
Yo, Moe, don't make me have to come back for those fuckin' prints!
- What you cursin' about?
- I'm sorry.
Beep beep.
Excuse me.
All right. I won't do it gain.
(Man) I'm outta here, man.
- Got 50 bucks?
- Nah, man.
Well, all I find, all I keep.
Don't be lookin' at me in the eye, nigger.
Your ass will be on this mural, too.
I know that look.
See, you wonderin' how
I got that AIDS, ain't ya?
- Nah, man.
- You a lyin' motherfucker!
It wasn't from fuckin' with them punks.
I ain't no homosexual.
No, man, I ain't say all that, all right?
Fuckin' with this shit.
I can't believe I got this shit.
All this time in these motherfuckin' streets!
And I'm a smart motherfucker.
I know I should've left that shit alone.
One time I was studyin' to be an accountant.
Now this shit is fuckin' my body up.
I have a goddam death sentence.
That's why I don't give a shit about nobody.
And I don't wanna see your ass no more!
Cos you ain't got no business out here fuckin' with this shit.
You'll end up like me. Or worse.
My old man... was a preacher.
And when I started messin' with this shit, he said, "You gonna pay for that.
"You gonna pay for that shit, boy."
He was right.
You can't cheat this shit no...mo'.
Get the fuck outta here!
Why you wanna be always arguin' with me?
No, wait. Listen to me.
How many pair sneakers you got?
- The pair I got on makes six.
- Yo, Rodney.
- Wait a second. Six, right?
- Yeah.
- How many pair o' feet you got?
- Two, like everybody else.
He don't see what I'm talkin' about.
- You don't, do you?
- What, man?
How you gonna make ten and spend ten, nigger? Ten minus ten make what?
- Zero.
- You wanna be a zero nigger?
- I don't want me no zero nigger.
- You ain't got one.
Right. Now you see what I'm sayin' to you?
Nigger wanna spend all his money like that gonna wake up broke every day of his life.
Why? Cos the nigger don't believe in hisself.
Thinkin' like a two-minute clock instead of the long haul.
Long term. See your future.
Y'all come work for me, this shit gonna be very different.
You gonna be savin' crazy money.
You gonna buy your moms a house in Strong Island. Right?
Everybody stick out your hands like this, palm down.
- What you all see?

- What you see?
- You 'posed to be seein' green.
All right. You get it, man?
No. You get it, nigger? You get it?
- I got it.

Excuse me. Excuse me.
- You all have a job to do inside?
- Yeah.
Well, let's go. Who trash?
What's the matter with you?
Man, you ain't heard what happened?
I ain't heard nothin'.
You told me if I wanted to get off them benches...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All's I hear is that Ahab's lookin' for a new night manager.
I heard that.
Look here. You gonna chill for a week or two, right?
Let the shit die down.
Be workin' still at my spot.
You gonna be on the benches, but Ahab is the joint.
I'm tellin' you.
I got it. I'm all right.
Nigger look bad, boy.
What we're gonna do, we're gonna mix the shit up with the food traffic.
Right? See, right now, we're doin' way too much business from my spot.
We got a crowd of black, white customers, out-of-state license plates, what have you.
Somebody gonna check that out. They gonna drop a dime on me, call 911.
With my jacket,
I can't go back to jail.
Ahab gonna be a nice front.
You did good, Strike.
You did good.
Now why you lookin' like that?
Somethin' wrong?
Huh?
You know it's me and you, right?
What I tell you?
You like my son, right?
I'm gonna look out for you. Right?
- I ain't let you down yet, have I?
- Nah.
OK, then.
Come in here. I'm gonna get somethin' to eat for you.
Come on.
Strike. What's up with that train set you got?
- It's all right.
- Fuckin' Choo-Choo Charlie.
You readin' a train book? Choo-choo!
Every man should have a hobby.
What's yours? Collectin' welfare?
That shit ain't funny, man. Word up.
Why you tryin' to play me, Strike?
I don't talk about them...
Fuck that, man!
I don't talk about them toys inside your crib.
Yeah, I know, cos I'll bust your motherfuckin' ass.
Yo, Shorty, what you laughin' at?
- One time says freeze!
- Fuck!
Hey, little man. Stay right there.
Stand up, mastermind.
Hmm. Oh. Is that Rodney?
- Rodney rang?
- You oughtta know.
- Y'all hear that noise about Darryl?
- Yeah, man.
Yeah, well, I had to tell his moms and pops last night.
That ain't no joke. I hate it.
Rough.
I just hope I never have to notify none of your parents.
Leave this shit alone!
- How them trains comin'?
- (Laughter)
Little man, come here. Come here.
What'd I tell you about bein' around these knuckleheads? Huh?
Now, I'm watchin' you.
Go on upstairs.
Yo, Andre. Why don't you go chase some criminals or somethin'?
Yo, Shorty. What you lookin' at?
Yo, come here, man.
Yeah, you. Come here.
Come on. Hurry up.
Quick. Time is money.
Come here.
God damn, Shorty!
This is some nappy shit.
When the last time you been in a barber shop?
I don't know.
'Put your hands up.'
(Shorty ) Ding-ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
Watch out. Flip. Shoot.
Yo.
Watch out! Duck! Now what? Come on.
Throw us somethin' else.
Yo!
- Where you manners at?
- Thanks.
- What's your name, Shorty?
- Tyrone Jeeter.
All right. Shorty.
(Strike ) Yo, there goes my brother, Victor. Shit.
- Wait here, all right?
- All right.
Be right back.
Vic!
Uh! Watch out! Oh, man!
Uh! Uh! Flip!
- Who did this? Huh? Who did this?
- ¿Qué?
Who did this? Who did this?
Who did this?
Who did this? Who did this?
Who's tryin' to be my son's daddy and gave him this haircut?
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Nobody don't know nothin' now, huh?
Yo no se nada.
I know you. I know you.
Cedric Stanley Gilmore.
And I know you, too. Ronnie Dunham.
Shit.
You used to live next door to me, remember?
I know your mother. Gloria.
You all ain't nothin' but a bunch of good-for-nothin', death-dealin' scum.
I find out who's been messin' with Tyrone,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your butt my own damn self.
Don't let me find Andre either.
Have a good Sunday.
Shit. I know that bitch ain't talkin' to me.
- Scientific, man, shut up.
- You shut up, man.
OK, Victor? Ready to go?
Normally I'd cuff you, brother, but you look like the kind of guy I can trust.
Like I said.
I had some drinks at Kool Breeze.
- Uh, Scotch.
- "Some"?
Like two or three.
I usually go in there after most work nights.
Uh-huh. How long were you in there?
Uh, I don't know.
About eight-thirty till about ten.
Uh, see... My shift...at Hambones -
I'm a...I'm a manager.
It don't end till ten.
I wasn't feelin' very good, so I left early.
You weren't feelin' good, so you went to Kool Breeze?
It wasn't like it was a "goin' home" not feelin' good.
You had a headache? An argument?
No, I just...just tired, man.
Go ahead.
So I left Kool Breeze, uh, started walkin' home.
I cut through Ahab's parking lot.
And this guy just flexed on me, man.
He jumped outta nowhere.
I got scared. You know the rest.
Tell me, Victor.
I just... I shot him.
Hey, little man.
I like that cut.
- Where'd you get it?
- Barber shop.
You know, you used to have a good head on your shoulders before Rodney got a hold of you.
Still do.
You know, Ronald, I been lookin' out for you since you been yea high.
Now, you don't want my guidance?
Fine. It's your life.
Let me tell you somethin'.
You even glance in the direction of that little kid Tyrone, and I'm gonna fuck you up so bad you're gonna wish I had killed you.
Now, do we have an understanding?
Do we have an understanding?
(Sighs) Yeah.
Why do we keep goin' through this?
I told you already.
The guy jumped outta nowhere, I got scared... Bam! Then I ran. I ran!
You mean bam, bam, bam, bam.
- What?
- Four bullets in the body.
- Where did you carry the gun?
- In my gym bag.
What else you carry in it?
My uniform from Hambones, a sandwich from home.
I don't eat Hambones myself, as quiet as it's kept.
OK. Was the, uh, gym bag zippered, locked?
Don't shake your head, Victor.
- (Andre ) Where's my mattresses?
- What?
I told you about my mattresses for them kids.
They ask, "You say we gonna have a tumblin' club. We need mattresses."
And I say, "Well, Strike's buyin' 'em. He promised."
Now, look, I ain't busted you yet, but till I do, you gonna be my main benefactor.
You gonna sponsor this club, you understand me?
And, Ronald, I'm only tellin' you one more time, you hear?
The store was closed.
One of them Jewish holidays.
- What Jewish holiday?
- I don't know. Pick one.
Tomorrow, all right?
I swear, I'll swing by tomorrow.
Andre, these cuffs is too tight, man.
You and me used to be tight.
(Strike ) Am I under arrest?
(Andre ) What for?
Could you uncuff me, please, and let me outta here?
You don't have to live like this.
There's more than just these projects out there, you know.
Don't you wanna go someplace you never been?
I mean, you love trains, but you've only ridden the subway.
Go on, man. Get outta here.
And get them mattresses for my kids, hear?
- Never.
- (Rocco ) Never?
You never walked by on a hot day with your two kids?
{2231}{2298}Excited and anxious|I await my dream
{2303}{2394}To escape, applaud|And embrace my team
{2402}{2464}Opening day I always can trust
{2471}{2557}It's just for this high|That I crazily lust
{2565}{2639}Return of our hero|Does brighten the days
{2646}{2725}Just briefly, my troubles|Get lost in the haze
{2732}{2809}The grace from the field|Arouses the crowd
{2814}{2895}Reflects on the days|When I was quite proud
{2910}{2972}I'm more entranced|Than the average fan
{2979}{3068}I used to play, you see|And I know I still can
{3075}{3142}That time I drove the ball|With such loft
{3157}{3260}My exit atop shoulders|As they carried me off
{3269}{3349}This pastime and I|Just fade into one
{3358}{3444}Expanded upon|From father and son
{3449}{3512}My boy is young|And awkward for now
{3524}{3600}I just need the time|And can show him how
{3617}{3706}I really am quite close|Just a break away
{3715}{3795}From straightening things out|And being okay
{3799}{3878}I can help my team|To regain its glory
{3888}{3984}With just a little twist|To the same old story
{4008}{4080}Players say now|They play for themselves
{4087}{4161}This causes a burning|Within me that dwells
{4171}{4245}The fan is the one|Who pays for the game
{4252}{4348}Which bestows all the riches|And welcomed fame
{4358}{4432}The players will listen|But really don't hear
{4440}{4535}All the while just hiding|Behind an invisible tear
{4547}{4619}I grow tired now of all this greed
{4627}{4715}And chart a course to set things free
{5737}{5801}We got our first caller.|Is that Gil on the cellular?
{5811}{5849}Yes, sir, it sure is.
{5861}{5952}- What's that I hear in the background?|- That's my Giants watch.
{5962}{6017}- I'm late for work.|- Giants watch, great.
{6024}{6106}- What do you got for us, Gil?|- It's just I'm really psyched.
{6113}{6168}Opening day's tomorrow.|We're all psyched.
{6175}{6252}This is different. I've been waiting|a long time for this one.
{6257}{6326}{y:i}- What are you waiting for?|- Bobby Rayburn. We got him.
{6331}{6420}- We're going all the way this year.|- What would you bet on that?
{6430}{6535}- I'd bet everything I own, that's for sure.|- I like this guy. You think Rayburn's...
{6545}{6619}...worth the 40 mil, huh?|-.310 lifetime batting average.
{6624}{6676}He's worth twice that,|three times that.
{6686}{6787}I bet he'd love to hear you say that.|Let's see if we can get him on the line.
{6792}{6878}- You're gonna get him on the line?|- "Yes. Hang on. Let's find Bobby."
{6887}{6957}When we come back, we will be|talking to Bobby Rayburn.
{6964}{6995}Great.
{7238}{7285}You got Bobby Rayburn|on the line yet?
{7293}{7348}Who the fuck does this|guy think he is?
{7353}{7439}- Three- time National League MVP?|- That allows him to fuck up my show?
{7448}{7506}- "Hello, I got Rayburn on the line."|- We got him!
{7516}{7554}And go.
{7559}{7647}Welcome back, we're here with the|hopes and dreams of all Giants fans.
{7657}{7727}Ex-Brave centre fielder|and league RBI champ...
{7734}{7827}... four of the last five years,|Local boy come home, Bobby Rayburn.
{7835}{7906}- How you doing, Bobby?|- Hey, Jewel, how you doing?
{7911}{7993}Good to be talking to you.|I want to tell you, I love your show.
{8010}{8057}- Thanks a lot.|- Bobby, this is Bernie...
{8062}{8129}A lot of fans are on the line|dying to talk to you.
{8134}{8209}But first, how does it feel|to be back in the Bay Area?
{8218}{8316}I'm telling you, it's great. I grew up|here. The Giants are my homies.
{8321}{8384}That's good to hear.|But let me ask you this:
{8391}{8458}You're famous for your|dedication to perfection.
{8465}{8523}You're one of the|hardest-working players.
{8527}{8563}Don't forget "good-looking."
{8571}{8611}But come on, now. Bobby, baby...
{8616}{8698}...do you honestly think you are worth|40 million simoleons?
{8707}{8765}He's one of the best ballplayers|in the league.
{8772}{8870}I'm glad you asked me. I don't like to|put a money value on a human being.
{8880}{8973}But I think I have given 100 percent|to every franchise I've played with.
{8981}{9017}Attaway, Bobby!
{9021}{9062}Thank you for not answering.
{9093}{9134}- Better retreat.|- She's a riot.
{9139}{9244}What about the fans? Won't all|this money raise their expectations?
{9254}{9369}I hope so. I consider myself a|baseball fan first and a player second.
{9379}{9446}And in the game of baseball,|it's all about the fans.
{9453}{9537}- You tell them, Bob.|- And the Juan Primo controversy?
{9542}{9590}Giants centre fielder since 1990.
{9597}{9669}You come in, bump him to the left.|Some people resent that.
{9678}{9738}- Bitch!|- I don't think Primo's one of them.
{9745}{9784}You know, he's a team player.
{9789}{9865}That makes him great.|I look forward to playing with him.
{9875}{9944}That's great, Bobby.|Let's get back to our callers. Gil?
{9952}{10033}- Yeah, am...? Am I on the air?|- Yes, you are, Gil.
{10059}{10112}Jewel, why do you|have to be so negative?
{10170}{10220}Come on, I'm a sweetheart.
{10225}{10294}The guy's making a lot of money.|Would you turn it down?
{10302}{10340}You'd be nuts to turn them down.
{10345}{10400}Why be down on Rayburn|because he's not nuts?
{10405}{10443}You got a point. I apologize.
{10448}{10513}- "Hey, Bobby, are you listening to me?"|- I sure am!
{10520}{10597}- Thanks for backing me up, man.|- No problem. It's a pleasure.
{10601}{10652}Just remember|where you heard it first.
{10656}{10726}I played the game.|I know what I'm talking about.
{10733}{10767}Grew up on the Giants.
{10772}{10841}My dad moved the family here|when the Giants moved here.
{10848}{10913}I watched you ever since|you hit the grand slam...
{10920}{10983}...against South Bay|in the '82 city championship.
{11011}{11105}That's when I saw you were somebody|special, and you never let me down.
{11112}{11186}When the two of you come together,|Rayburn and the Giants...
{11191}{11282}...that's like a magical conjunction,|like the alignment of the planets.
{11289}{11359}You're gonna bring us all the way.|Who said it first?
{11364}{11397}You did, Gil! You did!
{11405}{11469}- Attaway, Bobby!|- We hope so.
{11476}{11544}- Bobby, let's talk about your divorce.|- Christ, look.
{11551}{11642}I just got to the ballpark.|I'm really sorry, but I gotta go.
{11649}{11743}- Really enjoyed talking to you.|- Anytime, Bobby. Good luckout there.
{11752}{11783}We will be right back.
{11791}{11848}- I am so surprised he hung up.|- Thank you.
{12054}{12138}Giants haven't had a one- two punch|like this since Mays and McCovey.
{12184}{12236}Joining the list of bullshit excuses...
{12244}{12289}...we've had a lot of whining...
{12294}{12385}...about product quality from certain|members of our sales force.
{12392}{12462}Example: The two Jima line.
{12469}{12572}Gil, do you see|any quality problems there?
{12582}{12685}Blade's too thin, pommel's too light,|and there's a half tang hidden in there.
{12702}{12750}Maybe that's why you're not selling.
{12800}{12843}Sweet.
{12872}{12946}Somebody made a mistake, man.|I wear number 11.
{12953}{13044}- I'm sorry. I didn't know.|- It's cool. Manny, just handle it.
{13092}{13152}Me? I think this knife's an asskicker.
{13337}{13404}This door, on the other hand,|comes off a foreign car.
{13414}{13454}Well, need I say more?
{13493}{13572}- Why are you guys still here?|- There's been a glitch, okay?
{13577}{13625}- I'm working on it.|- What's a "glitch"?
{13632}{13716}A detail that hasn't been worked out.|Permutation that happens in...
{13725}{13764}What? With my number?
{13769}{13824}- Yeah, with your number.|- No, no, no.
{13829}{13874}Manny, you know I wear number 11.
{13881}{13939}- Of course.|- So there shouldn't be any problem.
{13946}{14006}It is a problem. Primo wears 11.
{14215}{14246}Tickets in yet?
{14253}{14310}Tickets? What tickets?
{14315}{14385}- Opening day.|- You got other things to worry about.
{14404}{14507}I'll let you in on a little secret, Gil. You|came this close to kissing pavement.
{14514}{14560}- How about that close?|- Yeah.
{14567}{14644}Management had you on the list.|I talked them out of it.
{14651}{14692}Don't make me regret it.
{14696}{14773}- Thanks, master.|- Okay, fuck it.
{14783}{14840}I'm not playing with number 33.|You understand?
{14847}{14903}I know. Just be cool.|Let me take care of it.
{14910}{14977}Three times 11 is 33.|You may play three- times better.
{14984}{15030}Thanks. I'll talk to you in a minute.
{15034}{15106}Jesus was 33 when he died.|People still talk about him.
{15111}{15169}- Give me my number.|- Think about it, seriously.
{15181}{15214}Should I fire him?
{15236}{15301}I should fire him, huh?|I should fire his butt.
{15363}{15392}Good form.
{15394}{15459}Seriously. I promised those tickets|to my clients.
{15464}{15519}Don't make me look|like an asshole. Please.
{15524}{15591}- I do have a reputation to uphold.|- A reputa...
{15615}{15660}Jesus-fucking"..."
{15667}{15773}Nobody cares. You're stuck in a|time warp with your head up your ass.
{15780}{15898}- Why, because I don't wanna sell crap?|- We are not dedicated to perfection!
{15907}{15972}People don't want quality.|They want cheap product.
{15979}{16080}When that fucks up, they want to|replace it, so that's what we give them.
{16267}{16332}You got till the end of the month, Gil.
{16363}{16404}Look...
{16411}{16502}...McKinley and Everest is our|biggest account. You better close on it.
{16545}{16595}Bring in the fucking numbers.
{16641}{16679}Asshole.
{16770}{16849}Sid, what was the missing link|on your ball club last season?
{16857}{16960}We'd have made the playoffs if Rayburn|hadn't hit that three- run shot in Atlanta.
{16969}{17056}Everybody said, "Why don't we|have a slugger like that?" Now we do.
{17065}{17140}- Bobby, a picture?|- Why don't we take one with Primo.
{17144}{17204}- Sounds good.|- Keep smiling.
{17216}{17252}Keep fucking smiling.
{17291}{17379}- I hope you like it in centre field.|- Yeah, I hope you like it in left.
{17502}{17540}No more questions.
{17571}{17684}2.5 million signing bonus.|Half this year and half the next. Yeah.
{17693}{17787}Well, well, if it isn't Jewel, my favourite|token female sports reporter.
{17797}{17871}- Blow me, Manny.|- I would, but you haven't had your shots.
{17876}{17945}There were also bonuses|based on winning the MVP...
{17952}{18003}I want an interview|with Rayburn, Manny.
{18022}{18089}Are we talking about "the|overpaid, overrated SOB...
{18094}{18142}...with the pending divorce Rayburn?
{18147}{18235}- I call them as I see them.|- Well, you've been crossed off the list.
{18242}{18314}- I knew you'd understand.|- Deferred payments starting 2007.
{18322}{18451}Cut the crap. Are you saying there's|no way to get your boy to talk to me?
{18461}{18521}Is that what you're saying?|He's gotta talk to me.
{18530}{18617}I'm saying he'd rather nail his penis|to a burning building.
{18624}{18717}- I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her.
{18727}{18765}Checkout this puppy.
{18787}{18818}The walk and the talk.
{18823}{18887}How's it walk? How's it talk?|This is the one.
{18926}{18979}Are you happy with your|current supplier?
{18983}{19096}Any more of these demonstrations,|I'll have to start shaving my legs.
{19103}{19149}Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.
{19161}{19247}The big motherfucker, the little|motherfucker. Which do you want?
{19269}{19353}Any more demos, I'll have to start|shaving the hairs on my ass.
{19367}{19456}As you can see, the performance|on this baby is really something.
{19679}{19707}"Knife doing business.
{19715}{19772}Come on, bring it, baby. Bring it.
{19964}{20043}- Jesus Christ.|- Poetry in motion, baby.
{20264}{20314}- Two behind home plate?|- I'm your man.
{20321}{20352}Two hundred dollars each.
{20360}{20405}- Two hundred apiece?|- Two hundred.
{20410}{20530}- That's a lot. How about 125?|- Fuck 125. This is opening day here.
{20539}{20628}- Two hundred, goddamn it. Jesus.|- Okay, okay, okay.
{20666}{20729}Now you want the tickets, huh?
{20767}{20861}Anytime I can do you more fucking|favours, you just let me know, all right?
{20880}{20949}You in a coma or what, buddy?|Get the fuckout of here.
{20973}{21033}- Know what bugs me about you guys?|- Like I care.
{21040}{21084}You don't even care about the game.
{21103}{21208}You ebony god, you prince of darkness,|you Othellian Moor, you black man!
{21213}{21297}You look good out there! You look|good. I bet we hit.400 this year.
{21307}{21393}- Come on, don't jinx me.|- I'm sorry, man. I get emotional, crazy.
{21400}{21470}All right, so tell me, what we got?
{21477}{21573}Spalding wants you to sign their balls.|We got that Wish Upon a Star routine:
{21582}{21681}Sick kid wants to shake hands with|great ballplayer. You'll have to do.
{21695}{21793}What do you think? Maybe I should|bring a ball for the sick kid.
{21801}{21865}No, I think a bat would be much nicer.
{21875}{21937}All right, here. Give him a bat.
{21944}{21995}You know it's not a good time for this.
{22031}{22122}- What's the gentleman's name again?|- His name's Stanley. Stanley Jackson.
{22148}{22199}Thank you, Michelle.
{22376}{22457}Stanley, Gil Renard.|Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.
{22467}{22513}- How do you do?|- How you doing?
{22517}{22561}Here's my card.
{22635}{22695}Are you happy|with your current supplier?
{22704}{22762}- I sure am.|- Well, then let me just...
{22769}{22879}If you could give me three minutes|of your time, I will prove to you...
{22889}{22920}- Can I demonstrate?|- Sure.
{22927}{22968}If I can just prove to you...
{22971}{23098}...we're superior in quality because|of our fit, hand-sharpening, polishing...
{23155}{23189}...and strength.
{23194}{23277}These features, combined with our|low prices, our superior terms...
{23285}{23359}...make us one of the most|sought-after competitors around.
{23364}{23443}- That's why I'd...|- We signed an exclusive with Gerber.
{23450}{23493}They got the whole chain sewed up.
{23503}{23575}We can't pass wind in a tent|without going through them.
{23584}{23618}Sorry to hear that.
{23663}{23740}- Do you have the Little Pecker?|- Yes, I do.
{23805}{23860}- You really are on the cutting edge.|- Yeah.
{23867}{23920}I'm sorry we can't do business.
{23937}{24002}Well, you're sure I can't|interest you in this?
{24057}{24117}You got any kayaks?
{24167}{24220}You gotta be|out of your mind. Kayaks?
{24227}{24284}I could use kayaks.
{24292}{24395}Stanley, what the fuck do kayaks|have to do with knives?
{24402}{24440}Never mind.
{24447}{24529}You fucking asshole. Kayaks?|When I'm asking you about knives?
{24534}{24596}Yeah. I understand, sir.|Thank you for coming in.
{24603}{24699}How about you get some kayaks and|stick them up your fucking ass, moron.
{24706}{24750}Your stopwatch.
{24917}{24992}Hey, thanks a lot for coming.|Nice to meet you.
{24999}{25066}Look. We got the same hairdo.
{25107}{25150}You sick too?

{25371}{25416}Sean.
{25426}{25466}Sean?
{25483}{25524}Sean.
{25538}{25625}Wow, what a coincidence.|That's my son's name too.
{25680}{25728}Look, I have a present for you.
{25747}{25781}There you go.
{25783}{25833}Maybe it'll make you feel better.
{25860}{25908}Bobby Rayburn.
{26011}{26051}Tomorrow...
{26068}{26123}...hit a home run for me.
{26188}{26270}- Please?|- I'll try.
{26303}{26385}They said "sick," not "dying in front|of our eyes." How'd I know?
{26394}{26493}As if I don't have enough to worry|about. I get a poor kid on his deathbed.
{26500}{26541}- Oh, please.|- The kid was dying!
{26545}{26624}He has my son's name.|I mean, what kind of shit is that?
{26742}{26797}Lucky tie, lucky guy.
{26929}{26972}McKinley- Everest.
{26979}{27025}Okay, thank you.
{27058}{27092}Hi.
{27111}{27205}- Angie, you're looking as lovely as ever.|- He's gone.
{27219}{27308}- We had an appointment at 4.|- Yeah, it's 4: 11.
{27320}{27404}My watch is slow, I guess.|When will he be back?
{27411}{27485}He's gone for the day. But you|can see him tomorrow at 2:30.
{27495}{27579}Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow"..."
{27660}{27703}Let's s"ee."
{27759}{27799}See if there's anything...
{27948}{27996}I would prefer the morning.
{28001}{28049}But how about late in the day?
{28056}{28106}I'm sorry.
{28113}{28178}Tomorrow at 3, he's off|to Chicago for three weeks.
{28209}{28248}Well, that's a problem.
{28264}{28322}It's my son. I want to take him|to opening day.
{28346}{28408}You know, myself as a father,|I'm a real cutup.
{28420}{28459}I'm gonna get to the point.
{28487}{28533}I'm trying to be a hero to my son...
{28543}{28641}...so if he could make it any other time,|it would really, really help me.
{28648}{28698}Just an hour later...
{28703}{28742}...so I could fit the game in.
{28749}{28842}- Excuse me. McKinley- Everest.|- Any other time at all? Anything?
{28852}{28912}- Okay, thank you.|- It would be a big help to me.
{28919}{28950}Like, an hour later.
{28953}{29041}I'm afraid I really can't help you.|He's got such a crazy schedule.
{29070}{29104}Okey- dokey.
{29178}{29257}Drop your cock and grab your socks.|Big day today. You excited?
{29267}{29305}Yeah, I'm up.
{29329}{29391}Manny, Manny, talk to me, man.|Make me happy.
{29396}{29458}Wish I could.|I just talked to Primo's people.
{29463}{29523}- They want 500 grand.|- Five hundred? For what?
{29530}{29621}Exactly. Exactly.|That's 250 G's a digit.
{29629}{29684}Man, come on!|What is this boy smoking?
{29689}{29782}I tried to haggle them down.|The kid says it's his lucky number.
{29789}{29883}Shit. Ain't that much luck in the world.|He's lucky to be in the country.
{29890}{29945}I hear you. Look, it's your call.
{29955}{30015}You want me to go back,|or are you happy with 33?
{30022}{30079}- Man, it's just a number, right?|- That's right.
{30087}{30151}I'll pick you up.|While you do her, thinkof me.
{30159}{30216}- That's a real short thought.|{y:i}- I love you too.
{30223}{30274}- No, you don't.|{y:i}- I'll catch you later.
{30281}{30324}Yeah.
{30638}{30672}Hey, Gil.
{30688}{30734}Hey, Ted.
{30758}{30801}Lose your job?
{30808}{30883}- It's my day off. And it's "Tim."|- Tim. Sorry.
{30892}{30947}- You remember Mike and Linda?|- Hey, Gil.
{30955}{30998}- Hi, Gil.|- Hi.
{31017}{31096}- You're late. What a surprise.|- Traffic. You know, traffic?
{31103}{31156}How original.
{31173}{31216}- Hi, Dad.|- How you doing?
{31223}{31283}- Good.|- Ready for the game?
{31295}{31377}- What time will he be home?|- Depends on the game. Right, slugger?
{31386}{31460}6:05. He's not home, I call the cops.
{31468}{31547}I'm against this.|I wanna make that real clear to you.
{31556}{31628}- He's my kid too.|- Yeah?
{31638}{31698}Give me kisses. I love you.
{31712}{31799}- Bye.|- For the record, so everybody knows...
{31806}{31863}...don't make him do things|he doesn't want to.
{31870}{31940}I don't. Do I make you do things|you don't want to do?
{31950}{31995}- No.|- Okay?
{32012}{32069}Six o'clock, Gil.
{32132}{32175}Hey, Ted.
{32182}{32216}See you.
{32683}{32755}I remember when Mick recorded this,|February '78.
{32782}{32813}What?
{32837}{32935}I remember when Mick recorded this|in '78. We had a wild party afterwards.
{32945}{33005}Jason Pelligrini's dad|says Mick Jagger's gay.
{33009}{33100}Yeah? Well, Jason Pelligrini's dad|takes it up the ass.
{33242}{33309}- Tryouts are next week.|- Tryouts are next week?
{33328}{33364}Your mother didn't tell me.
{33371}{33460}Jason Pelligrini said his dad's|gonna pick me if I'm still available.
{33470}{33544}You'll make it. Positive things|happen to positive thinkers.
{33659}{33757}Tell me, what do you gotta do? What|are the three whats you gotta be?
{33767}{33839}- I don't want to do this, Dad.|- At bat, come on.
{33846}{33913}- Keep the bat low.|- No, keep it high, high.
{33920}{33980}- When you move your feet?|- Step on the eggshell...
{33988}{34052}...and squash the bug.|- Attaboy. That's perfect.
{34062}{34151}That's what Coop used to say.|I told you about what Coop said, right?
{34158}{34254}- Your old catcher, right?|- One of the finest athletes I ever knew.
{34393}{34438}Where'd you get that glove?
{34453}{34496}Tim gave it to me.
{34515}{34546}Piece of shit.
{34995}{35059}Opening day at|Candlestick Park, 1996.
{35066}{35114}What's not to love|about opening day?
{35122}{35213}Fathers sneaking away from work,|and kids playing hooky from school.
{35222}{35292}For at least one day,|everybody is in first place.
{35301}{35376}Opening day is what baseball's about.|How exciting is it...
{35383}{35440}...for Giants fans|with Rayburn coming hom"e..."
{35448}{35508}... after leading the Braves|to a championship?
{35834}{35896}Did you see that?|See the way he moved his legs?
{35903}{35949}- Can I have a hot dog?|- A what?
{35956}{35994}Can I have a hot dog?
{36018}{36049}You're in my seat.
{36057}{36126}If it isn't the ubiquitous|queen of AM radio herself.
{36133}{36189}Good morning, my sweet angel,|darling, baby.
{36196}{36227}Oh, yeah, whatever.
{36232}{36316}Manny, come on, don't dick me around.|It's an important piece, okay?
{36328}{36414}There's somebody there behind|that killer smile. I promis"e..."
{36421}{36483}...I will not hurt your boy.|I want Bobby Rayburn.
{36491}{36536}Bernie, correct me if I'm wrong...
{36543}{36637}...but isn't she the ball-buster|who had the temerity to ask my client...
{36644}{36694}...if he was honestly worth 40 million?
{36702}{36742}- Am I a ball-buster?|- Yeah.
{36747}{36793}Thank you.
{36805}{36862}- Whose is this?|- It's mine. I spit in it.
{36999}{37049}I thought your mother|confiscated that.
{37056}{37097}She did.
{38140}{38171}Play ball!
{38366}{38421}Yeah, attaway!
{38687}{38725}Strike.
{38752}{38823}What are you doing? You missed it.|Hawkins struck him out.
{38831}{38881}- Pay attention.|- I'm sorry, Dad.
{38910}{38960}Blaze winds, and the pitch to Pryor...
{38965}{39020}...swung on and driven deep|towards the gap.
{39027}{39063}He crushed it!
{39109}{39176}- Watch, watch, watch.|- What?
{39198}{39231}I got it!
{39267}{39298}I got it!
{39305}{39375}Primo and Rayburn giving chase.|They converge and"..."
{39382}{39428}Lookout!
{39569}{39605}Centre field makes the calls.
{39763}{39830}Fundamental of baseball,|centre field makes the calls.
{39838}{39869}Pay attention.
{39907}{39960}Well, a scary moment on day one.
{39967}{40063}I'll tell you, Rayburn's slow getting up.|And Primo's still slow getting up.
{40073}{40137}There's $40 million out there|in centre field, Steve.
{40145}{40193}Hope the Giants have|collision coverage.
{40202}{40267}This will help relieve the pain.
{40305}{40377}- Doc, is the rib bruised or fractured?|- Neither.
{40387}{40468}Bobby, what are you doing?|We got 161 games to go out there.
{40475}{40521}Could you excuse me for a minute?
{40528}{40595}Thank you. You just signed|a $40 million contract.
{40603}{40667}Hurt yourself, you'll be batting|.100 by month's end.
{40674}{40732}The media'll turn on you|faster than the fans.
{40749}{40804}- Listen, you gotta come out.|- I can't.
{40813}{40852}I gotta be Babe- fucking-Ruth.
{40859}{40914}It's William-fucking-Bendix.|Get it right.
{41099}{41132}- You having fun?|- Yeah.
{41137}{41259}I'm just gonna make some phone calls.|Okay? Just business calls. I'll be back.
{41271}{41365}- Go?|- Just downstairs for a minute.
{41372}{41437}Mom said we have to be home by 6,|or she'll be upset.
{41446}{41478}Forget about your mother.
{41883}{41928}I got it!
{42139}{42240}The wind took it. The wind took it.|Kid was lucky.
{42250}{42286}Kid was lucky.
{42305}{42336}Wind took it.
{42353}{42429}- You stepped on me.|- Don't worry. We'll get one next time.
{42437}{42525}Okay, I gotta go, all right?|I'll be back.
{42597}{42660}- You don't have to pee or anything?|- No.
{42928}{42964}What happened?
{42969}{43055}Lanz hit one to right. Bases loaded.|Come on, grand slam!
{43062}{43142}Don't get greedy, son.|What we need now is a sacrifice.
{43151}{43235}A winning team knows how to|manufacture runs. Coop taught me that.
{43240}{43321}Know why he said the most|beautiful play is a sacrifice fly?
{43331}{43412}- You sacrifice for the team?|- And doesn't bring down your average.
{43420}{43482}That's why baseball's|better than life. It's fair.
{43492}{43523}Tell me what happens.
{43528}{43590}Now batting, number 33...
{43597}{43650}... Bobby Rayburn.
{43686}{43724}Come on, Bobby!
{43981}{44031}Attaway, Bobby!
{44511}{44563}Rayburn look a little stiff to you?
{44571}{44638}I can't believe they left him in|after that collision.
{44645}{44726}Right. That's all we need,|our $40 million man on the DL.
{44918}{44983}He's playing hurt. That's a|man showing his mettle.
{44990}{45110}Putting the team first. Remember,|last year he hit.314 against lefties.
{45134}{45187}Yo, Bobby!
{45367}{45443}- Time!|- Oh, fuck.
{45453}{45513}Come on, let's play some|fucking baseball!
{46151}{46210}All right, Bobby, let's go!
{46230}{46261}Play!
{46462}{46493}All right, Bobby!
{46503}{46568}- Go for it, Bobby!|- Go, Bobby!
{46575}{46613}Bobby!
{46678}{46712}Hey, buddy...
{46719}{46774}...you wanna sit down?|Trying to see here.
{46781}{46819}Go, Bobby!
{47294}{47383}Come on! Let's go with|the fucking game! Shit!
{47469}{47500}Strike!
{47510}{47603}Are you out of your mind, ump?|Are you out of your fucking mind?
{47613}{47666}- Hey, sit down.|- Take your hands off me.
{47673}{47709}- Stop pushing, man!|- Just ask.
{47716}{47814}- Why the fuck you pushing? I'm asking.|- Both of you, down in front!
{47822}{47910}- Fuck you!|- Down in front! Now!
{48105}{48189}Let's play some fucking ball!|You all right?
{48263}{48313}What's your fucking problem?
{48340}{48373}You old busybody!
{48397}{48462}I gotta go, okay? I'll be back.
{48476}{48515}Fuck you!
{49747}{49785}Oh, fuck.
{49891}{49932}Get out of here.
{49977}{50063}So could you just send me|over the stats? Yes.
{50073}{50116}Okay. Thank you very much.
{50131}{50186}I'm sorry I'm late.|Your hair looks nice.
{50191}{50277}- I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid he left.|- He left.
{50294}{50327}- For the ball game.|- What?
{50332}{50368}Yes, for the ball game.
{50375}{50442}- I thought he had a plane to catch.|- Plans changed.
{50517}{50572}But he did leave you this note.
{50658}{50740}- He didn't draw a smiley face, did he?|- What?
{50744}{50833}The previous assistant got him|in the habit of drawing a smiley fac"e..."
{50843}{50955}...instead of "sincerely," and I keep|telling him it's not always appropriate.
{50987}{51039}No, it's perfectly appropriate.
{51569}{51624}Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.
{51941}{51984}Hey, congratulations, fellas.
{52022}{52073}Hey, Babe- fucking-Ruth.
{52080}{52133}- William-fucking-Bendix.|- That's right.
{52149}{52190}So did the kid see his home run?
{52197}{52238}The kid didn't even see it.
{52243}{52322}He slipped into a coma,|and he never pulled out. I'm sorry.
{52329}{52401}- How come you didn't tell me?|- Like you take bad news well.
{52411}{52511}What am I supposed to say?|"Great news, the kid didn't make it."
{52521}{52610}That's all right, man.|Enough of these hospital gigs.
{52614}{52684}They're off the list.|You know what the bright side is?
{52691}{52751}You knocked the cover off the ball.|You're back.
{52758}{52806}The hell I did. It was a fluke.
{52818}{52859}I never even saw the pitch.
{52960}{53012}Let go, Tim.
{53084}{53132}- What do you want?|- How is he? He okay?
{53140}{53209}He's not. He's crying his eyes out.|What do you think?
{53219}{53271}- Come on, don't start.|- Don't you start.
{53274}{53334}You violated your agreement.|I called my lawyer.
{53343}{53384}I'm getting a restraining order.
{53389}{53446}- Don't start.|- No, don't you start. Go away.
{53456}{53533}- I've had it. I don't care what you want.|- Let me see him.
{53538}{53612}You had to bring him home?|What is wrong with you?
{53619}{53710}- I want you out. Tim, call the cops.|- I'm gonna explain to him.
{53727}{53787}- Come on, everything's okay.|- You bastard.
{53796}{53880}You motherfucker! You cocksuck...!
{53890}{53938}- Hey.|- Tim!
{53974}{54051}Tim, call the cops. He fucking hit me!
{54089}{54137}Hey. Hey, slugger.
{54144}{54216}Slugger, I'm sorry. You forgive me?
{54233}{54274}- Hey.|- You left me.
{54281}{54334}I know, I screwed up. I'm sorry.
{54338}{54410}- You forgive Dad?|- Mom's got a terrible headache.
{54417}{54477}Well, that's called a migraine.|She'll live.
{54494}{54561}Look what I got for you.|I got your favourite pizza.
{54636}{54684}Gil, open the door!
{54763}{54842}- Gil, open the door.|- It's got pepperoni and mushroom.
{54849}{54921}- I don't like mushrooms.|- You can pick them off.
{54947}{55065}Is it true, if Mom marries Tim,|I'm not gonna be a Renard anymore?
{55137}{55194}- Gil, open the door.|- It's open!
{55199}{55249}- It's locked.|- It's open.
{55257}{55338}It's locked, Gil. Open the door now.|I'm calling the police.
{55362}{55424}You still worried about the tryouts?
{55429}{55496}I don't know.|Think I'll make the majors?
{55506}{55568}Of course you'll make it.|Remember what I said.
{55573}{55659}Positive things happen|to positive thinkers. Who said that?
{55693}{55734}- Coop.|- Damn straight.
{55746}{55813}He was the greatest player|I ever played with.
{55837}{55885}Gil, unlock the door.
{55890}{55921}Got you a Coke.
{55942}{55997}Call the cops.
{56009}{56067}Didn't you hear me? Call the cops!
{56072}{56134}Call the fucking police!
{56139}{56187}- I can't drink Coke.|- Who says?
{56194}{56264}Mom and Dad. I mean, Tim.
{56297}{56336}The door's locked. It's okay.
{56364}{56400}Gil, open the door.
{56583}{56616}Hey, Art.
{56621}{56700}I said, " Enough of this shit.|You sign the contract right now."
{56707}{56805}He signed it. I swear to God,|on my honour, he signed the contract.
{56815}{56856}Hey, Gil, got a second?
{56861}{56913}If you do. It's 8:00.
{56928}{56964}- Shall we?|- There you go.
{56995}{57036}Sit down, Gil.
{57081}{57122}That's okay, I'll stand.
{57129}{57189}Chuck from McKinley and Everest|called yesterday.
{57220}{57299}Said they wanted to drop|their account with us.
{57323}{57379}I sent Figgy over there|to sort things out.
{57383}{57422}You sent Figgy down?
{57453}{57506}- Sit down, Gil.|- Yeah, he sorted them out.
{57513}{57616}He did it with my opening-day tickets.|What are you gonna do about it?
{57625}{57697}- He didn't steal your account.|- He did. What will you do?
{57705}{57748}We gave him your account.
{57777}{57824}I gave him your account.
{57865}{57896}What do you mean?
{57944}{57992}You're not getting|the numbers we need.
{58002}{58076}I know. It's been a little slow|last couple of months.
{58083}{58163}But that'll change. I've got|a new strategy. It's gonna work.
{58170}{58244}- Listen, your behaviour is unacceptable.|- What do you mean?
{58292}{58369}- People are scared of you.|- Why, because of the other day?
{58376}{58457}You cannot do things like that|in this day and...
{58501}{58551}I want your reorder book.
{58563}{58664}Outstanding commissions|will be forwarded.
{58920}{58961}My father started this business.
{58966}{59076}Look, perfection and principles don't|belong in business, not now or then.
{59086}{59155}- As a friend of your father's...|- Keep your mouth shut.
{59160}{59205}You know nothing about my father.
{59299}{59369}- He made this business.|- Your father made knives.
{59376}{59445}- San Francisco made this business.|- By ripping him off.
{59452}{59510}He wasn't a businessman, Gil...
{59532}{59572}...and neither are you.
{59603}{59647}That's the bottom line.
{60462}{60534}And so, in a Freudian sense, Jewel...
{60541}{60613}... the catcher is the father,|and the son is the pitcher.
{60622}{60673} that's fascinating.|Let me ask you.
{60678}{60771}- What does the bat and ball represent?|- Well, the bat speaks for itself...
{60776}{60833}... and, of course,|the ball is the ejaculate.
{60841}{60910}Thanks for calling, doc.|Who do we have on line two?
{60915}{60992}- Do we have anybody on line two?|- I believe everybody hung up.
{61023}{61126}Hey, man. Hey, you got a van?|Kids are breaking into your van.
{61133}{61219}Somebody's breaking into your van.|Stop those kids. Cut that out.
{61227}{61279}- What?|- Kids breaking into a van out there.
{61311}{61351}- Yeah.|- Here, this is for you.
{61356}{61397}- What's that?|- Take it. Take it.
{61404}{61457}- Take it.|- What is it?
{61464}{61543}It's for you.|It's a temporary restraining order.
{61553}{61591}- What?|- You have been s"erve"d.
{61661}{61697}Hey, man, can I use your...?
{61704}{61754}Okay, last one.
{61795}{61852}Good swing. All right, who's next?
{61857}{61917}Eleven. Let's go, buddy.|Hustle up there.
{61924}{61963}- Okay, pal.|- Come on, Rich.
{62020}{62071}Okay, watch the ball.
{62099}{62123}Good swing.
{62143}{62198}Next one, Richie.
{62289}{62337}Attaway, Richie boy.
{62493}{62538}- That's okay.|- He's throwing too hard.
{62543}{62605}He almost took his head off.|Hey, coach. Coach.
{62610}{62653}- Yeah.|- Slow down.
{62663}{62725}- This is Little League. Little League.|- I know.
{62737}{62799}- Leave him alone, Gil.|- Mind your fucking business.
{62843}{62910}Hey, coach, mix in some strikes.|What are you doing?
{62917}{62975}- You're making it hard.|- I'll coach from here.
{62982}{63066}- Mix in some strikes.|- He's throwing strikes, Gil.
{63075}{63138}- Fuck it, I'm gonna go down.|- Easy, Gil.
{63142}{63209}Remember, Ellen's got|that restraining order on you.
{63214}{63284}- The bat is too fucking heavy.|- Come on.
{63315}{63389}You fuck with me,|I'll send your head into the outfield.
{63526}{63576}Go easy. You're letting the bat|swing him.
{63588}{63672}- Hey, hey, come on, you guy.|- Look how heavy this bat is.
{63691}{63715}Here.
{63814}{63883}Let go of my son.
{63893}{63953}- He's my son too.|- Don't remind me. Get off him.
{63960}{64029}- He's my son too.|- You are not gonna ruin our lives.
{64034}{64118}- Tim, call the cops now.|- I'm just trying to tell him something.
{64128}{64166}Get out of here. Tim!
{64209}{64272}You get out of here.|Can't you read, stupid?
{64279}{64353}The restraining order says|you have to stay 100 yards away.
{64363}{64423}- Tell him one thing.|- You can't come near him.
{64427}{64492}- I wanna tell him one thing.|- Get out of here.
{64499}{64564}- I just wanna tell him one thing.|- You better go.
{64569}{64655}Don't swing at anything.|Wait for a good one.
{64665}{64744}Step on the eggshell,|squash the bug. Okay?
{64811}{64881}You mind your fucking business.|You're lucky.
{64950}{65032}Just give him... Give him something.|He's a kid.
{65183}{65267}It's okay. Play ball.
{65288}{65343}Bobby Rayburn again|failed to earn his k eep.
{65351}{65413}Almost grounding into|a game-ending double play...
{65418}{65463}... just beating the throw to first.
{65470}{65516}When the Giants|needed a pick-me-up...
{65521}{65602}... number 11, Juan Primo,|}provides San Francisco with a lift.
{65612}{65698}And it was a big one. His two-run|shot over the left-field fence...
{65705}{65768}... scored Rayburn,|and the Giants went home happy.
{65775}{65832}That is, except possibly|Bobby Rayburn...
{65837}{65928}... whose lackof hitting is giving|new meaning to the term "three hole."
{65938}{66003}The way Primo's carried|this team on his shoulders...
{66010}{66079}... mak es you wonder who the real|$40 million player is.
{66242}{66336}Lanz came up with a big hit to drive|in a k ey run in the Giants' victory.
{66343}{66405}Jimmy has been a spark plug|during this home stand.
{67496}{67549}Motherfuck.
{68084}{68189}Ladies and gentlemen, now batting,|the centre fielder, number 33...
{68199}{68266}... Bobby Rayburn.
{68621}{68690}All right, Bobby, let's go!
{68700}{68729}All right, Bobby.
{69129}{69160}Strike.
{69321}{69352}Strike.
{69465}{69530}- Strike thr"ee."|- Shit.
{69537}{69611}Ladies and gentlemen,|with courtesy to the players...
{69618}{69678}... please refrain|from excessive noise...
{69688}{69762}... and throwing anything|onto the field. Thank you.
{69767}{69848}Forty-million-dollar man's|paying off, huh?
{69865}{69983}Now batting, number 33,|Bobby Rayburn.
{70028}{70079}Well, here it is, Memorial Day weekend.
{70086}{70179}You think back to the opening-day|grand slam, doesn't seem long ago.
{70189}{70258}But lately, Bobby Rayburn|has really had difficulties...
{70263}{70345}... and can't seem to find his strok e.|He lacks aggressiveness.
{70352}{70417}And you start to wonder|when you call it a slump.
{70426}{70484}Most superstars aren't gonna|sit down for you.
{70489}{70525}But you gotta wonder...
{70532}{70594}... when he's gonna|breakout of this thing.
{70757}{70781}Strike.
{71042}{71076}Come on, Bobby. Come on.
{71721}{71757}Out.
{71946}{72018}Now batting, number 46, Jimmy Lanz.
{72028}{72071}You'll be all right.
{72198}{72248}You still want that interview?
{72270}{72364}You'd let Bobby Rayburn do an|interview with a...? What was it?
{72385}{72459}- Castrating ball-buster.|- Castrating ball-buster, that's it.
{72467}{72531}- I thought I was off your list.|- Come on.
{72539}{72584}Schindler has a list, not me, okay?
{72589}{72663}When you're hitting.183,|you don't get to have a list.
{72774}{72817}Lock er room.
{72836}{72881}- "Giants' lock er room."|- Bobby Rayburn.
{72889}{72965}- "Yeah, who's calling?"|- A friend of his. I have to talk to him.
{72975}{73013}It's really important.
{73018}{73061}Rayburn, phone.
{73114}{73164}- Yeah, this is Bobby.|- "Bobby?"
{73172}{73231}- Yeah.|- Bobby Rayburn.
{73236}{73289}"Yes. Yes, who is this"?
{73294}{73366}Hello. Look, say something.
{73373}{73409}Hello?
{73433}{73524}Yo, Stook, I thought you were|supposed to screen my calls here.
{74188}{74241}- Burn, baby, burn.|- Come on, give me some.
{74246}{74320}- What's up, Dad? Gaining a little weight.|- Yeah, yeah, I am.
{74330}{74406}- Stopped by the doughnut spot.|- Cool. Is he for me?
{74413}{74454}Yeah, he's for you.
{74481}{74505}What's his name?
{74509}{74586}- He told me it's Bradley.|- What else did he say, Dr. Dolittle?
{74634}{74687}Dad, how come|you haven't been hitting?
{74867}{74905}How's the rib cage, Bobby?
{74912}{74970}My rib cage is sick|of people asking about it.
{74977}{75039}They say you should've|came out that first gam"e..."
{75046}{75114}...but you were hot-dogging,|so you screwed yourself.
{75118}{75200}That supposed to be a dis|or something? I hit.314 last season.
{75209}{75277}- That's bullshit.|- I'm telling you what people say.
{75284}{75327}I can put a positive spin on this.
{75341}{75384}- How?|- How? I'll tell you how.
{75389}{75449}We set up an interview,|get a piece out of it.
{75456}{75536}You tell the people why you stayed in.|It's for the kid in chemo.
{75543}{75622}You get public sympathy.|I smell forgiveness in the Bay Area.
{75631}{75708}- Is that exploiting the kid's death?|- Not comfortable with it?
{75715}{75780}- Should I be?|- I think you should be.
{75835}{75866}Well, I don't think I am.
{76113}{76200}Excuse me. I'll have a vodka|and orange juice, please.
{76240}{76298}And whatever the lady wants.
{76315}{76363}Jackon the rocks, thanks.
{76442}{76475}What?
{76567}{76636}Oh, shit. I did it again, didn't I?
{76643}{76730}No, it's okay.|I'm used to all of this interview shit.
{76921}{77000}Look, no offence intended,|but it's no secret...
{77005}{77082}...that you're playing like shit.|It's gotta be affecting you.
{77092}{77128}Of course it's affecting me.
{77132}{77204}I'm paid to produce.|I can't even hit the side of a barn.
{77211}{77317}- How do you think it makes me feel?|- Do you know what I think, Mr. Rayburn?
{77329}{77391}No, but I'm quite sure|you're gonna tell me.
{77451}{77497}I think the slump is a good thing.
{77506}{77554}Now, what kind of twisted shit is that?
{77569}{77645}It's gonna teach you|to cut yourself a little slack.
{77662}{77729}- You can't keep up this act forever.|- Now it's an act.
{77737}{77842}Oh, yeah, Mr. Perfect. Mr. No-Error.|Nobody can live up to that shit.
{77852}{77928}You gotta give yourself a break.|It's just a lie anyhow.
{77940}{78041}Yeah. It doesn't seem like a lie|when I'm hitting.
{78087}{78142}Now batting for the Giants,|number 11...
{78149}{78218}... the right fielder, Juan Primo.
{78290}{78350}Sit down, let Bobby bat!
{78698}{78741}He's a hot dog. He's lucky.
{78830}{78935}Now batting, number 11, Juan Primo.
{79501}{79595}Now batting, number 33,|Bobby Rayburn.
{79674}{79712}Let's play some fucking ball!
{79753}{79777}Thanks, Primo.
{79940}{79997}Fuck you, Rayburn.
{80158}{80266}- You suck.|- Bobby, Bobby.
{80367}{80407}You suck!
{80415}{80458}Don't listen to them, Bobby!
{81532}{81563}Okay.
{81685}{81745}Line drive to the right.
{81760}{81810}Don't tell me|where it's gonna go, Dad.
{82553}{82618}I wish we had a whole team|like him.
{82707}{82738}Fuckin' asshole!
{82906}{82954}- Hey, Bobby.|- Hey, Nikki. The usual.
{82959}{83041}- Alrighty.|- Hey, Bob.
{83285}{83316}You guys wanna play pool?
{83331}{83386}- What a waste of space.|- What do you mean?
{83391}{83470}He hit a bad patch.|We all hit bad patches, don't we?
{83503}{83585}- You never hit a bad patch?|- No, this is my dream job.
{83755}{83801}- I'm gonna talk to him.|- Please, man.
{83806}{83906}These guys come to relax. You bug|them, they're gonna stop coming here.
{83918}{83978}I know him. I've talked to him|on the phone.
{84026}{84067}Hey, Bob.
{84168}{84216}Can I talk to you for a second?
{84235}{84307}- Sure. You wanna talk to me?|- Maybe we can go someplace.
{84311}{84369}- Let me finish the game.|- Okay.
{84539}{84599}Primo, it's late, man. All right?
{84609}{84688}- Tell me what it is you want.|- I want nothing.
{84707}{84760}You don't understand|how things work here.
{84767}{84827}Because it's different|from where you come from.
{84851}{84885}What's different?
{84892}{84971}Look, when a player like me|comes into a team like this...
{84978}{85026}...hey, man, shit gets worked out.
{85031}{85091}Right? You don't...|What is the problem with that?
{85179}{85242}What kind of uniforms|do you have down there?
{85254}{85328}- Just uniforms.|- Like these pussy pants you're wearing?
{85338}{85398}- What...? What colour?|- Blue.
{85405}{85501}- What number is on the backof yours?|- Eleven.
{85517}{85621}Primo, what is your price?
{85633}{85719}No price. You already|had a chance, baby. Okay?
{85726}{85800}- What's your fucking price?|- Go fuck yourself.
{85810}{85889}- Hey, don't walk away from me, man.|- Fuck you.
{85927}{85978}Motherfucker. What?
{86088}{86150}- Break it up!|- Get off of him.
{86237}{86306}- I want my fucking number, man.|- Chill out.
{86349}{86402}What are we talking about|Juan Primo for...
{86407}{86510}...when we've got Bobby Rayburn where|we want him, up close and exclusive.
{86517}{86568}Are you ready for your next caller?
{86570}{86613}- Let's get another caller.|- Bobby.
{86620}{86711}- You guys are getting a kickout of this.|- What are you talking about?
{86721}{86795}I'm talking about my season is like|a bad freeway accident.
{86803}{86863}And you guys, you're just|slowing down to watch.
{86872}{86946}I thought I'd enjoy this,|but the fact is, I feel for you.
{86954}{86994}I didn't know it'd be so rough.
{87002}{87107}Who we talking to? On the car phone,|we are talking to Gil.
{87117}{87196}Hey, is that our old buddy Gil?|Mr. Magical-Conjunction himself.
{87203}{87263}- Is this Jewel?|- You're on the air. Go ahead.
{87270}{87328}You're getting break-up|on the line here.
{87332}{87419}- I heard what you said about Primo.|- What's your question for Bobby?
{87431}{87491}Is Bobby listening? Bobby?|Hey, Bob?
{87500}{87553}Yeah, Gil, I'm here, man.|How you doing?
{87565}{87647}I wanna tell you that I know exactly|what you're going through...
{87656}{87769}...more than you'll ever understand.|This number 11 thing is a fucking joke.
{87776}{87843}You're the greatest player|this city's ever had...
{87848}{87925}...and you got some hot-dogger|like Primo...
{87934}{87982}...giving you a hard time|about your number.
{87987}{88033}There's a reason|you're paid 40 million.
{88040}{88097}The owners aren't doing|what they should be.
{88102}{88164}They should be protecting|their investment.
{88174}{88220}{y:i}Pay him. Give him what he wants.
{88224}{88277}If he wants a million, give it to him.
{88284}{88375}If he doesn't want it and doesn't want|to give up his number, fuck him.
{88383}{88462}Get him out. What's the difference?|Just get you hitting again.
{88469}{88553}- Lf that's what it's gonna take.|- They say fans don't know...
{88560}{88661}...what they're talking about. The public|and the owners should listen to you.
{88668}{88723}Bobby, why isn't this guy|on your payroll?
{88730}{88833}Thanks, Gil. Maybe I should have you|try and talk some sense into Primo.
{88848}{88896}God knows I need|all the help I can get.
{88965}{89030}They say fans don't know|what they're talking about.
{89037}{89095}The public and the owners|should listen to you.
{89102}{89157}Bobby, why isn't this guy|on your payroll?
{89162}{89265}Maybe I should have you try|and talk some sense into Primo.
{89289}{89382}The owners should listen to you. Bobby,|why isn't this guy on your payroll?
{89392}{89474}Maybe I should have you try|and talk some sense into Primo.
{89485}{89567}Maybe I should have you try|and talk some sense into Primo.
{89574}{89639}God knows I need all the help|I can get.
{89905}{89979}Primo. Primo, lots of luck.
{89984}{90020}Primo.
{91111}{91154}Mr. Primo?
{91200}{91274}- Yeah?|- Can I just say...?
{91317}{91392}Did you ever think how one man|who's doing well...
{91399}{91468}...might throw off|the rest of the team?
{91523}{91607}I'm saying, you have to thinkof|what's best for the team, right?
{91622}{91701}You might have to|lay down a sacrifice.
{91708}{91775}I'm talking about|Bobby Rayburn's number.
{91785}{91876}I don't know if you understand|how much he needs that number.
{91881}{91950}- Number 11.|- I am number 11.
{91979}{92034}I know, but he needs it|more than you.
{92264}{92303}Are you with the press?
{92360}{92394}You with the hotel?
{92554}{92595}Then get out of here.
{92684}{92715}Go.
{93168}{93207}Get the fuckout of here.
{95518}{95602}It's a sad night here at the Stick|as the Giants tak e the field...
{95607}{95714}... for the first time since the murder|of hitting sensation Juan Primo.
{95724}{95796}Rayburn will take his place|in the lineup batting cleanup.
{95806}{95870}There's bound to be questions|about that, Jewel.
{96506}{96556}Now we all get to wear|the number, man.
{97920}{97966}Come on, let's play ball!
{98016}{98141}Now batting fourth, number 33,|Bobby Rayburn.
{98153}{98244}Bobby! Come on, Bobby!
{98254}{98313}Fuck you.
{98654}{98678}Come on, Bob!
{99213}{99237}That's it.
{99450}{99486}Come on, Bob!
{99493}{99548}Attaway. You're back to your old self.
{99742}{99800}Fuck you.
{99925}{99987}This is the last place I'll look.|Then I'll quit.
{99994}{100071}Yeah, no, I've had it. I'm tired.|I mean, he's not here.
{100080}{100167}There he is. I found my man.|I'll talk to you later.
{100325}{100399}Is this how you celebrate|going four for four, huh?
{100409}{100474}What happened to pouring|champagne over your head...
{100483}{100531}...and banging some groupies, huh?
{100565}{100627}Bobby. Bobby, talk to me.
{100634}{100704}If the cops worry you,|they're not interested in you.
{100713}{100783}It's just an ongoing investigation.|Let it go.
{100790}{100833}I didn't ask for this, man.
{100843}{100920}You talking about Primo?|Come on, I know that's shit.
{100927}{101016}I thought about it a lot,|but I didn't ask for this.
{101044}{101109}You know, Bobsy...
{101123}{101181}...I wish five people dead|on my drive to work.
{101188}{101253}Five people. But wishing it|doesn't make it so.
{101260}{101320}You're not God,|lifetime average withstanding.
{101363}{101409}Yeah? Well...
{101423}{101471}...why do I feel so bad then, huh?
{101485}{101519}I don't know.
{101531}{101562}I don't...
{101572}{101644}This is gonna blow the hell|out of my shithead theory...
{101651}{101696}...but I think you feel guilty.
{101718}{101756}Jesus-hairy-Christ.
{101768}{101802}I've been wrong about you.
{101809}{101871}You're not a shithead at all.|I'm flabbergasted.
{101879}{101939}Come on, let's go, man.|I got a game tomorrow.
{102234}{102315}Number 33, Bobby Rayburn.
{102399}{102480}Go, Bobby! Bobby!
{102574}{102610}Safe.
{102727}{102785}Bobby Rayburn.
{102910}{102972}You're coming off|the worst slump in your career.
{102979}{103089}All of a sudden, you're hitting well over|.400, 11 home runs, 30 RBIs last month.
{103099}{103130}How do you explain this?
{103145}{103181}I wish I knew.
{103207}{103253}That's it? You wish you knew?
{103322}{103365}A "thank you" would've been nice.
{103782}{103814}Sean!
{103828}{103869}Be careful!
{103953}{104001}Don't go too far!
{104116}{104176}Sean, don't go too far, darling.
{104240}{104274}Bradley!
{104281}{104322}Bradley, come here!
{104459}{104492}Bradley, come back.
{104622}{104667}Go back, Bradley. Go back.
{104691}{104761}Sean!
{104900}{104943}Sean!
{104950}{105022}Mr. Rayburn!
{105111}{105139}Shit.
{105269}{105307}Mr. Rayburn!
{106027}{106053}Sean!
{106791}{106849}- Thank God for Mark Spitz over here.|- Jeez.
{106861}{106957}Okay. Just relax. Go on.|That's right, blow it out.
{106966}{106998}It's gonna be all right.
{107005}{107036}Are you all right, man?
{107055}{107105}- Just relax.|- He swallowed some water.
{107115}{107175}Jesus. You scared me half to death.
{107197}{107228}Where did you come from?
{107233}{107331}I was just walking on the beach,|I saw him in the water, and I went in.
{107340}{107405}Thank God, man. You all right?
{107434}{107496}Sean, you gotta promise me,|no matter what...
{107503}{107556}...not a word to your mother,|understand?
{107563}{107647}Next time you're looking|for attention, be more dramatic.
{107657}{107741}- Let's get some dry clothes.|- Play in traffic like the other kids.
{107748}{107801}- That little bonehead.|- Oh, shit.
{107885}{107957}- What did you say your name was?|- My friends call me Curly.
{107961}{108067}Curly. Well, come on, Curly,|let's go inside.
{108086}{108165}Elvira will get you some|dry clothes, all right?
{108240}{108280}Thank you.
{109760}{109829}- What do I say?|- Well, you know, I was just there.
{109836}{109879}You would've done the same thing.
{109887}{109956}If I lose this guy, man,|I don't know what I would do.
{109971}{110016}Looks good on you.
{110021}{110071}I don't know|about them pants, though.
{110076}{110117}They're yours.
{110124}{110172}- Can I get you anything?|- A beer.
{110179}{110282}Yeah, all right. I could swear...|Have I seen you before?
{110292}{110381}I get that all the time.|I got one of those faces, I guess.
{110469}{110510}You like baseball?
{110522}{110604}I'm not obsessed with it or anything.|Are you a player?
{110620}{110671}Yeah.
{110678}{110721}- You are?|- Yeah.
{110776}{110822}Barry Bonds?
{110882}{110956}No. No. I'm Bobby Rayburn.
{110966}{111004}- Right.|- Yeah.
{111011}{111107}- I was just kidding you.|- It's okay.
{111131}{111210}At least you're not one of them|die- hard baseball fans who...
{111215}{111246}Why is that?
{111253}{111294}Because those guys are losers.
{111354}{111402}Aren't the fans what it's all about?
{111409}{111479}Shit. Tell you something, man.
{111488}{111579}The fans are like women.|When you're hitting, they love you.
{111587}{111673}And when you're not, they'd as soon|spit on you as look at you.
{111682}{111726}Why is that?
{111759}{111860}Because they don't understand that|you're the same person hitting or not.
{111898}{111932}You know?
{111944}{112009}Only person you should play for|is yourself.
{112155}{112193}Hey, you wanna shoot some pool?
{112198}{112251}Yeah, sure.
{112258}{112315}- All right. Bring the beer.|- Sure.
{112462}{112548}Curly, Curly"..."
{112608}{112644}Curly Otis?
{112649}{112697}- Yeah, that's my old man.|- No shit.
{112711}{112793}I was in bigs for a cup of coffee myself|until my arm went south.
{112802}{112850}Man, tough break.
{112864}{112917}It's like my old catcher Coop|used to say:
{112924}{112980}"Enjoy it while you got it,|then move on."
{112994}{113025}Yeah.
{113068}{113157}That's a good philosophy, brother.|Good philosophy.
{113234}{113310}- Are all those hats yours?|- Yep, my pride and joy.
{113327}{113387}- Could I try one on?|- Yeah, sure. Sure.
{113622}{113660}Fits.
{113670}{113718}Looks good on you.
{113790}{113828}Hey, Bobby...
{113867}{113929}...did you mean it?|You'd do something for me?
{113934}{114006}Yeah, sure. I mean, within reason,|you know.
{114011}{114044}Don't be getting no ideas.
{114058}{114099}- Let me pitch to you.|- What?
{114104}{114200}Let me show you what I got.|I got a couple innings left in me.
{114207}{114272}Come on, Bobby,|let me show you what I got.
{114305}{114363}Bradley's gonna catch for us.
{114569}{114620}Must feel good|to be hitting again, huh?
{114627}{114696}Brother, you have no idea.
{114703}{114790}- How did you get out of that slump?|- Say what?
{114809}{114881}Got any idea what got you|out of that slump?
{114905}{114953}You know, Curly...
{114970}{115025}...I just stopped caring, man.
{115051}{115125}- What?|- I just stopped caring.
{115133}{115176}You stopped caring?
{115183}{115219}What do you mean?
{115272}{115336}All my life I've been working|to be the best.
{115341}{115411}You know?|Trying to be a perfectionist.
{115423}{115535}And I thought about it. That's probably|where I made my mistake.
{115574}{115682}And when Juan Primo died, man, that|completely changed the perspective.
{115691}{115727}I mean"..."
{115734}{115785}I mean, come on, let's be real here.
{115804}{115885}What are we doing? We're not|curing cancer, you know?
{115897}{115941}We're playing a game.
{115955}{116003}That's all it is. It's just a game.
{116013}{116094}So I stopped caring and relaxed...
{116128}{116161}...and I started hitting.
{116171}{116209}Stopped caring.
{116243}{116305}So that's your fucking insight|into life?
{116334}{116377}Just stop caring.
{116511}{116578}- You're pretty loose now, aren't you?|- Yeah.
{116602}{116684}All I'm saying is that there's|more to life than just baseball.
{116693}{116739}Like what? Like your house?
{116744}{116828}Like your bigass car?|Like your 40-fucking-million?
{116861}{116936}I mean, what the fuck|do you care about?
{116943}{117012}I care about my son.|That's what I care about.
{117027}{117132}I'm sorry. I just hate that attitude,|you stopped caring. I'm sorry.
{117142}{117195}What, do you have a better theory?
{117204}{117240}Yeah.
{117254}{117295}You got your number back.
{117326}{117422}Curly, my number didn't have|anything to do with it.
{117868}{117919}It looks good on you.
{117947}{117981}Thanks.
{118108}{118192}- That's great.|- I still haven't given you my best pitch.
{118199}{118261}- Sure you have.|- No.
{118305}{118338}Okay.
{118343}{118449}Look, Curly, I really want to thank you|for what you did for my son.
{118470}{118537}You know, what do you say?|Let's call it a night?
{118547}{118578}All right.
{118655}{118748}Come on, admit it. We're alone.
{118796}{118842}Admit what?
{118849}{118914}Admit you're hitting|because Primo's not around.
{118950}{119000}That's a bunch of bullshit.|Come on.
{119005}{119062}It doesn't hurt he's not around.
{119091}{119139}Come on, level with me.
{119194}{119237}Level with me.
{119247}{119326}Come on, I saved your kid.|You wanna pay me back?
{119333}{119420}Be honest with me and tell me|you're a little happy that he's dead.
{119429}{119523}- Hey.|- No, no. I'm not happy that he's dead.
{119566}{119597}Come on.
{119602}{119662}Curly. Curly, I already told you no.
{119678}{119762}No, I am not happy|that he's dead. Okay?
{119796}{119882}Okay? Can I have my hand back now?
{119894}{119930}Thanks.
{120024}{120132}I'm really tired. Really.|I'm going to sleep. Take care.
{120144}{120196}Simple "thank you"|would have been nic"e..."
{120201}{120259}...for a teammate|who lays down a sacrifice.
{120297}{120355}Hey, look,|you need a ride or anything?
{120359}{120417}I got my own wheels. Thanks, Bob.
{120424}{120467}Good. Bradley, let's go.
{120474}{120530}If you need anything,|just call me, all right?
{120539}{120594}And I'll get back to you.|Okay, bye.
{120602}{120652}Take care. Come on, Bradley.
{120683}{120721}Hey, Bob?
{120733}{120796}Bobby. What about the glove, Bob?
{120803}{120834}Keep it!
{121820}{121884}I remember when Mick recorded this.|December '77.
{121901}{121949}We drove home at dawn.
{122002}{122045}Who's Mick?
{122052}{122102}A great friend of mine.
{122122}{122177}- Where we going?|- We're going fishing.
{122186}{122242}- Why can't my dad come?|- Your dad could come.
{122249}{122330}But he has a big game tomorrow,|and we gotta pick up Coop.
{122433}{122474}Why are we fishing at night?
{122481}{122551}Night fishing is best. No boats|to scare the fish away.
{122570}{122651}We'll sucker them in with a flashlight,|cut them up with this.
{122661}{122711}Go ahead, take it. It's yours.
{122728}{122783}- You sure?|- Yeah, it's yours. Take it.
{122798}{122867}- Well, thanks.|- Just don't cut yourself.
{123555}{123608}- Hello.|- Hey, Curly.
{123615}{123661}Hey, Bobby. Hey.
{123668}{123723}Say hello to your father.|He's on the phone.
{123730}{123774}Hi, Dad. We're going fishing.
{123778}{123822}That's great. That's great, Sean.
{123829}{123917}Listen, Curly, could you|pick up the handset so we could talk?
{123927}{123968}Sure thing, slugger.
{123973}{124056}- Yeah.|- Curly, is it raining where you are?
{124064}{124140}- No, I'm far from the beach.|- Didn't know you'd take the car.
{124148}{124244}- I thought the kid, he'd like to get away.|{y:i}- Listen, Curly...
{124260}{124344}...before you do anything stupid,|I don't think this is a good idea.
{124351}{124399}You don't think. You're a lucky idiot.
{124407}{124440}I'm not fucking with you.
{124447}{124505}- All right.|- Don't get angry at me, Bob.
{124512}{124538}- Curly?|- Bob?
{124550}{124594}I just want my son back.
{124598}{124625}- Bob?|- What?
{124632}{124656}- Bobby.|- What?!
{124661}{124769}Listen to you. You're hanging on every|word I say. This is really something.
{124776}{124843}Curly, what do you want?|What do you want from me?
{124956}{125011}Don't talk back.|You show me some respect.
{125018}{125073}Without people like me,|you're nothing.
{125097}{125152}We're the ones that get you|your 40 million.
{125171}{125267}- Look, what do you want?|- What do I want?
{125308}{125368}I want when they thinkof you,|they thinkof me.
{125375}{125464}Curly, I don't know what the fuck|I did to you to piss you off...
{125471}{125538}...but my son has nothing|to do with this.
{125553}{125692}Oh, Bobby, it's not what you did to me,|it's what I did for you, number 11.
{125701}{125749}- You owe me.|- I owe you what?
{125773}{125812}Check your freezer.
{125824}{125867}I'll hang on.
{125881}{125939}- There's a surprise.|- What the f...? Curly.
{125943}{126039}- Go ahead, check your freezer.|- All right, I'll check the freezer.
{126049}{126092}Curly, don't hang up this phone.
{126097}{126142}You hear me?
{126154}{126183}Oh, my God!
{126337}{126409}He finally figures it out,|ladies and gentlemen.
{126416}{126473}It's really true what they say|about sluggers.
{126480}{126531}They are really, really stupid.
{126540}{126658}Well, I'm a pitcher, Bobby.|Pitchers use their brains.
{127044}{127089}Come on, Bradley.
{127212}{127274}We'll play a joke on him,|so you just play along.
{127281}{127320}- All right.|- Okay?
{127629}{127658}Hey, Coop.
{127703}{127742}Gil.
{127775}{127821}Gil.
{127830}{127885}- Gil Renard.|- Yeah.
{127893}{127933}Gil Renard.
{127943}{127996}Yeah, long time no see, Gil.
{128010}{128082}- This is my son.|- Hi.
{128228}{128274}Come on in, fellas.
{128281}{128317}Go ahead.
{128550}{128636}Man, that is a kick-ass car.|You done good for yourself.
{128655}{128717}You never see nothing like that|in the Bronx.
{128727}{128782}I always thought|you'd be managing by now.
{128789}{128835}- Managing?|- Yeah, in the majors.
{128842}{128919}Nobody calls me Coop anymore,|you sick son of a bitch.
{128986}{129036}How'd you find me anyway?
{129127}{129178}I looked you up.
{129235}{129286}Whose kid is that, really?
{129362}{129434}- You really want to know?|- Yeah.
{129461}{129528}- Bobby Rayburn's.|- Jesus fuck.
{129537}{129614}Same old fucking Gil. Come on.
{129674}{129710}Really?
{130367}{130408}He'll be on in a minute.
{130523}{130578}You'll recognize his voice.
{130612}{130727}All right, incoming call. Notify|incoming call. Turn off all radios.
{130736}{130770}Okay, this is it.
{130808}{130854}Bob.
{131072}{131137}- Yeah.|- Hey, Bobby, you still up?
{131163}{131221}- Bad time to be calling, huh?|- I'm up.
{131228}{131360}Hey, I hope I'm not calling at a bad time.|Probably got some people over, huh?
{131372}{131443}I can't hear you. You'll have to|turn the music down.
{131451}{131487}Oh, I'm sorry, slugger.
{131499}{131547}Curly, I want to talk to Sean.
{131580}{131700}Sean, he's asleep now, but he's doing|fine. Don't worry about him. He's fine.
{131719}{131791}- Curly, what do you want?|- "I've been thinking it over."
{131810}{131889}You know, in life, life just...
{131911}{131973}...comes down to one single action.
{132029}{132074}What do you want?
{132096}{132146}I want you to hit a home run|for me, Bob.
{132177}{132218}Are you serious?
{132223}{132275}Remember that kid in chemo...
{132290}{132345}...whose life was unfair to him?
{132369}{132443}That's how I'm feeling.|My life has been unfair to me.
{132496}{132611}The only difference is, I'll be able to see|you hit that home run tomorrow.
{132618}{132649}And I got a photo here.
{132685}{132779}I'm gonna get it to you. And I want you|to put it on the Jumbotron, okay?
{132868}{132949}- Yeah.|- Then I want you to stand up and tell...
{132956}{132992}...the 50 million viewers...
{132997}{133103}...that this home run|is dedicated to Gil, a true fan.
{133179}{133244}- What do you think?|- I can't believe you're serious.
{133254}{133314}I'm serious as a heart attack, Bobby.
{133323}{133371}That's pretty serious, isn't it?
{133410}{133510}There comes a time in everybody's life|when you have to stand for something.
{133520}{133589}Otherwise, you're just|passing on through.
{133597}{133647}So, Bobby, I'm watching you.
{133659}{133733}If that pitcher goes easy on you,|I'll kill your fucking kid.
{133812}{133855}Surprise, surprise.
{133872}{133915}Hey, Bobby.
{133942}{133987}I'm still here.
{134031}{134074}Now do you care?
{134498}{134558}You get in some serious shit for that.
{134599}{134651}Cops are gonna be all over us.
{134699}{134767}Boy, all of a sudden,|you lost your sense of humour.
{134781}{134838}- Did you get it?|- Couldn't get him.
{134874}{134975}He's calling from Rayburn's car. We|should be able to nail him to the district.
{135136}{135244}You're not gonna believe this kid.|Just like old times, huh, Coop?
{135323}{135404}- You know, that's not my real dad.|- It's okay, kid.
{135560}{135611}Come on, I'm waiting.
{135627}{135675}I'm waiting. The signals.
{135685}{135757}What happened? Did you forget|everything? Come on, Coop.
{136167}{136208}Hang in there, kid.
{136263}{136313}Bring the bat up, slugger.
{136320}{136399}Come on, look like a hitter.|Bring it up.
{136411}{136459}Bring it up. Come on.
{136469}{136562}Come on! Come on, slugger,|bring the fucking bat up.
{136572}{136615}Come on.
{136639}{136682}That's my boy.
{136699}{136781}It's all right, kid, hang in there, now.|Hang in there.
{137035}{137075}Coop, you dickhead!
{137078}{137123}Come on, kid. Come on.
{137176}{137231}Go. Go. Up the fence. Come on.
{137238}{137274}Come on, push. Push. Go.
{137291}{137368}Go. Go on. Go, kid, go.
{137406}{137449}Coop, what are you doing?
{137627}{137689}Why did you do that?|We could've been teammates.
{137713}{137780}We were teammates.|We could've made it to the bigs.
{137785}{137840}It was Little League.|We were 12 years old.
{138588}{138629}Come on.
{138771}{138819}That's my boy.
{139173}{139248}Ladies and gentlemen,|leading off the second inning...
{139255}{139334}... Giants centre fielder, number 33,|Bobby Rayburn.
{139375}{139428}Well, the forecast is for rain tonight.
{139435}{139504}There's a mist falling as Rayburn steps|towards the box.
{139511}{139583}He's been more aggressive|the last month of the season.
{139593}{139627}Who do we have on line two?
{139631}{139715}- Just a fan.|- Hey, Mr. Fan, how you doing?
{139730}{139797}Wanna say you're lucky to be|in the stadium tonight.
{139804}{139857}Really? Why's that?
{139897}{139969}- Is that a Giants watch I hear playing?|- Yes, it is.
{139977}{140046}- Is that my buddy Gil?|- Maybe.
{140058}{140137}This'll be one of the most amazing|nights in the game's history.
{140176}{140235}- "It'll be incredible."|- Really? Why's that, Gil?
{140243}{140298}I'm telling you,|the Kirk Gibson homer...
{140303}{140384}...Ripken breaking Gehrig's record,|peanuts compared to tonight.
{140391}{140463}You're talking about classic moments|in baseball history.
{140470}{140528}What's happening tonight|that could top those?
{140535}{140576}Let's just say Bobby Rayburn's...
{140581}{140633}- "... in for the night of his life."|- Why, Gil?
{140643}{140732}Well, some people are ungrateful.|They should be taught a lesson.
{140775}{140813}Strike!
{140936}{140986}Are you calling from|inside the stadium?
{140993}{141072}- Wouldn't you like to know?|- "Well..."
{141089}{141185}You got good seats? Are you behind|first base? Can you see me?
{141195}{141240}Can I see you?
{141252}{141334}Yeah, you're waving right at me.|Have a nice night.
{141341}{141420}Gil, wait. Before you hang up,|I wanted to ask you a question.
{141430}{141506}- Trying to trace the call, Jewel?|- What? What was that, Gil?
{141513}{141542}You'll never find me.
{141605}{141681}- Strike!|- Have a nice night.
{141688}{141746}Gil. Fuck!
{141751}{141799}Come on, man, go get him!
{141820}{141861}Play!
{141902}{141947}Yes!
{142261}{142293}Shit.
{142309}{142381}Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.
{142404}{142447}- Did you feel that raindrop?|- What?
{142454}{142505}I felt rain.
{142683}{142767}- The guy's not gonna be crazy enough...|- He's here! The guy's here.
{142772}{142851}- He could've been near a radio.|- He's in the stadium.
{142913}{142987}Look at that. That is one fine piece|of craftsmanship.
{142992}{143033}- What?|- The knife.
{143038}{143103}It's a first edition. See how it|says "prototype?
{143107}{143182}That means it's a collector's piece.
{143186}{143290}"Renard & Garrity." It's a local firm,|isn't it? Gilbert Renard?
{143570}{143625}What are you waiting for,|a clue, an invite?
{143635}{143731}This guy is gonna kill Bobby's kid|if you don't find him in nine innings.
{143743}{143829}Ladies and gentlemen, leading off|the bottom of the eighth...
{143836}{143894}... number 33, Bobby Rayburn.
{143899}{143999}Bobby's as safe as Kennedy was|in Dallas. What are you looking for?
{144030}{144076}Play!
{144448}{144488}Ball one.
{144496}{144584}- What, are you walking me?|- Consider it a compliment, dickhead.
{144601}{144666}Fuck! Do you know what you're|doing to me?!
{144675}{144738}- They're giving him first base.|- Throw the pitch!
{144747}{144788}Fuck!
{144992}{145028}Fuck.
{145035}{145102}Oh, man, the ump's gonna|call the game. Oh, my... Fuck.
{145136}{145198}Oh, God, please don't do this.|I'm begging you.
{145208}{145244}Don't... Throw the pitch.
{145248}{145306}For God's sake, listen to me!|Throw the pitch!
{145313}{145366}Throw the fucking pitch!
{145392}{145474}- Do you know what you're doing to me?|- "The umpire has decided..."
{145479}{145534}... to send both teams|into the dugouts.
{145541}{145594}It looks like we've got a rain delay.
{145663}{145752}Ladies and gentlemen, the umpire|has called for a rain delay...
{145759}{145865}... with the Padres|leading the Giants 2 to 1.
{146023}{146114}Do you and your dad have a special|place he and you like to go?
{146138}{146193}Stadium in the Sky's|our Little League park.
{146205}{146275}My dad used to play there|when he was a kid.
{146313}{146363}Is my daddy in trouble?
{146819}{146850}Ladies and gentlemen...
{146855}{146944}... we resume play with the Giants|batting in the bottom of the eighth.
{146963}{147056}Proceed to Little League park|Stadium in the Sky, 24th and Sanchez.
{147066}{147116}We pick it up in the eighth inning...
{147123}{147174}...on what might be Rayburn's|last at-bat.
{147181}{147222}They'll play on this wet field.
{147229}{147310}The cold night air is getting|to everybody. Look at Rayburn.
{147318}{147392}He's going to the mound to have|a chat with Martinez.
{147435}{147509}- Oh, shit.|- I don't give a fuck what he tells you.
{147519}{147593}Throw the ball over the plate,|or I'll break your head in.
{147600}{147644}- Fuck you.|- You hear me?
{147692}{147773}This may go back to when Martinez|pitched for Pittsburgh.
{147787}{147857}He drilled Rayburn in his back|with a fastball.
{147862}{147910}We are seeing it all tonight, Rick.
{147972}{148061}- Let's go, gentlemen.|- First pitch is at your head, buddy.
{148068}{148111}Come on, man, do this! Do this!
{148255}{148351}A critical at-bat for Rayburn,|the $40 million San Francisco Giant.
{148360}{148420}Probably his last chance|to get the Giants even.
{148430}{148521}Here in the bottom of the eighth,|the Giants trail 2 to 1.
{148629}{148699}- "Swung on. Strik e one."|- Strike!
{148761}{148828}All right, come on! Come on, Bobby!
{149252}{149327}Swung on and missed. Strik e two.|Rayburn in the hole.
{149334}{149432}One strike left|for Bobby Rayburn tonight.
{149442}{149497}Jesus Christ, man.
{149655}{149744}Air Seven copy. Proceeding|to Stadium in the Sky. Over.
{149789}{149852}- Man.|- They're gonna call the game.
{149859}{149914}They're gonna call this fucking game.
{150559}{150607}Two and two. Two balls, two strik es.
{150614}{150693}And Rayburn down to his last strik e.
{150717}{150777}Bobby knows he's had|two pitches to drive there.
{150784}{150859}Now at 2-2, you're not gonna|get another good pitch to hit.
{150866}{150947}Maybe, since it's damp, he's having|trouble holding the ball.
{150957}{151007}This game could be called|at any second.
{151456}{151516}Play ball!
{151732}{151796}San Diego protecting|its one-run lead.

{154105}{154189}- Shit.|- What the hell's going on?
{154306}{154395}Okay, okay. I just want my kid back.
{154404}{154479}Batter up, Bobby.|I waited a long time for this.

{154692}{154745}Come on, where is my son?
{154759}{154831}Where's...? Bobby,|where's my home run?
{154841}{154929}What?! Curly. Curly.|Where's my son?!
{154963}{155023}Where is he? I don't know.
{155054}{155107}I guess he's in that big stadium|in the sky.
{155124}{155191}I'm telling you, Curly,|if you hurt my fucking kid...
{155198}{155342}...I swear to God I'll kill you!|- Bobby. Bobby. Be nice, Bob.

{156663}{156694}Now do you care?
{156747}{156797}Bobby, now do you care?
{156857}{156905}Just a little bit?
{157032}{157075}Curly, don't!

Heads up! Good defense!
Good defense.
We're going downtown.
Shut the hell up...
...you stupid mutt.
What do you want?
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
I have a package for you.
It sounds broken.
Most likely. I'll bet it was something nice. This is an insurance form.
If you'll just sign here, here, and here...
...initial here, put your name here...
...we'll get the rest of the forms to you soon.
That's a lovely dog.
- Do you mind if I pet him?
- I don't give a rat's ass.
Oh, brother.
That's fine, I can finish the rest.
Have a good day. Take care.
Bye-bye.
Excuse me, HDS!
HDS, coming through!
Got a package, people!
Get away from the door.
What's the matter with you?
I said, get!
Son of a bitch!
That was a close one, ladies and gentlemen.
Unfortunately...
...in every contest there must be a loser.
Loohooserrhher.
Hungry?
There you go.
No problem. It gets flooded, we'll just wait a few seconds.
Or we can try it now.
Putz!
Come on!
Get out! Get out!
Assholes are closer than they appear.
Give me a push while you're there.
Alrighty, then.
It's alive!
It's alive!
Oh, my little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
I won't let him. No, I won't.
He can keep the big TV, but he's not going to hurt my baby, no he's not.
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.
How can I ever repay you?
The reward would be good.
There is some damage to my car, and I had to fill it with premium.
Would you like for me to take your pants off instead?
Gee... Let me think.
Sure!
People are real friendly around here.
Ventura?
Yes, Satan?
I'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.
You owe me rent.
Mr. Shickadance, I told you, you're my first priority.
I'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.
Look at that. That's an albino pigeon.
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.
As soon as I find this bird...
...you're paid.
I heard animals in there.
I heard them again this morning, scratching around.
I never bring my work home with me.
What's all this pet food for?
Fiber.
Want to look inside? Come on!
Come on!
Go ahead, snoop around.
Well?
Are you satisfied?
Just don't let me catch you with an animal in here.
All right.
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.
Loser.
Come to me, jungle friends.
Roger, let me ask you one question!
How the hell do you lose a 500-pound fish?
Sorry, I was just going to say...
...it's not a fish, it's a mammal.
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.
She didn't mean anything by that.
I don't give a good goddamn about that fish.
Fillet it if you want to.
All I give a damn about is winning the Super Bowl.
At the least, I've got to have their heads in the right place.
Shit, you've been in this business a long time...
...you know how superstitious these players are.
The quarterback has put his socks on backwards since high school.
I've got a linebacker that hasn't washed his jockey strap in two years...
...because he thinks flies are lucky.
I want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.
Find the fish...
...or find new jobs!
Why did it have to happen now, two weeks before the Super Bowl?
I'll tell you who did it.
It's those animal-rights activists.
Always out with their signs:
"Animals were born free, stop torturing Snowflake."
It lives better than we do.
The police are checking into the animal- rights groups. Have they called back?
No, but I wanted to tell you, when I lost my Cuddles...
...I hired a pet detective.
A what?
A pet detective.
Thanks, Martha, but we better leave this to professionals.
Well, actually, he was quite good.
Pet detection is a very involved, highly scientific process.
Like a glove!
Mr. Ventura here to see you.
Thanks. Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.
Pleased to meet you.
Did you get any trouble getting in?
No, the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle.
Security's tight, Super Bowl week.
Have a seat. I'll get right to the point.
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last night.
Are you familiar with Snowflake?
Negative.
We got him from the Miami Seaquarium.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.
This is one of the new tricks he was going to do at half-time.
Let's go.
Blue 42, blue 42.
Hut, hut!
All right!
Come on, let's go!
Good boy!
Want an ashtray?
I don't smoke.
It's a disgusting habit.
The police came today.
Apparently, the kidnappers came in through the back gate.
They said, some kind of a...
Four-wheel drive van, loaded from the rear.
How you holding up?
If I'm walking funny it's because
I have two dozen reporters up my ass.
They've been asking me about Snowflake all morning.
Who's he?
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.
He's our pet detective.
Nice to meet you, you were highly recommended by Martha Mertz.
Martha Mertz?
Oh, yeah, the bitch.
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
Half-dead when I found her.
Is that the tank?
Excuse me.
- Cops drain it?
- Yes, this morning.
If I'm not back in five minutes...
...just wait longer.
Captain's log, Star Date 23.9, round it off to the nearest decimal point.
We've traveled back in time to save an ancient species from annihilation.
So far...
...no signs of aquatic life, but I am going to find it...
...if I have to tear this universe another black hole.
I've got to, mister!
Oh, great.
I'll try to head them off.
Ace, get out of the tank.
I just can't do it, Captain.
I don't have the power.
People!
I said, get out of the tank now!
For God's sake, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a pool man.
Where's Snowflake?
Snowflake is not available right now.
I've been waiting all day.
I must get a shot of his new trick.
Is he sick?
People, people.
How can I get the work done mit all the shouting?
What's wrong mit ze shouting?!
Who the hell is that?
That's...
Heinz Gezwellwert,
I'm trainer of dolphins.
You want to talk to the dolphin, you talk to me.
What happened to the regular trainer?
Vhat happened to him?
Vhat happened to me?!
It's seven years
I'm making the grade.
We are making the dolphins disappear, und then Roy is coming...
...mit the vhite tiger, und the stuffing in the pants...
...und I'm gone!
Where is Snowflake?
Why do you care about Snowflake?
Do you know him?
Does he call you at home?
Do you have a dorsal fin?
To train the dolphin you must think like the dolphin.
You must be getting unside the dolphin's head und communicating.
I'm saying to Snowflake...
Und he is saying...
Und he is up on the tail...
Und you can quote him!
All right, it's just about time for Coach Shula's press conference.
So why don't I take you folks over that way and let... Heinz...
Go to the conference.
Go to it.
Lassie must be missing.
Make any good collars lately?
Or were they leashes?
Homicide, Ventura.
How are you going to solve that one?
Good question, Aguado.
First, I'd establish a motive.
Here, the killer saw the size of the bug's dick and became insanely jealous.
Then I'd lose 30 pounds...
...porking his wife.
Oh, you!
Come on.
Now kiss and make up.
Excuse me...
...l'd like to ass you a few questions.
This is not the time, Ace.
If Einhorn come down here and see me talking to you or your ass, I'm history.
I can keep him under control. You must tell me who's on the Snowflake case.
I can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.
All right, that's it.
Now, it's my turn.
Five minutes alone, that's all I need.
Better look alive,
Einhorn's on her way down.
Come on, now. Please.
What's the matter, afraid I'll make a stink?
Come on.
Aguado's working the case, all right?
Aguado.
Good call.
Look, we're a little busy now...
...with murderers and burglaries and drug dealers and things like that.
A missing dolphin isn't exactly a high priority.
Now you've pissed him off.
- You'll get me in trouble.
- I can't hold him much longer!
My boss is coming.
Okay, look.
We checked with local animal-rights groups.
We checked out the taxidermists and we already checked on van rentals.
So far, nothing, nathan, nada.
All right?
Any unusual bets being made?
Of course, this is the Super Bowl.
- What'd you find out about the tank?
- Nothing unusual.
Some tire tracks, an escape route, and a guard that didn't see anything.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Now will you please get out of here before I get in trouble?
Thank you for your cooperation.
By the way, do you have a mint?
Perhaps some Binaca?
"Assholomio...
"...Osodomia..."
Holy testicle Tuesday!
What the hell is he doing here?!
I came to confess.
I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll.
Spare me the routine, Ventura. I know you're working the Snowflake case.
May I suggest you yield to the experts on this one?
We'll find the porpoise.
Now I feel better.
Of course, that might not do any good.
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
A dolphin's been taken.
A common porpoise has an abrupt snout...
...and pointed teeth, while the bottle-nosed dolphin...
...has a long beak, round, cone-shaped teeth and a serrated dorsal fin.
But I'm sure you already knew that.
That's what turns me on about you...
...your attention to detail.
Listen, pet dick...
...how would you like me to make your life a living hell?
Well, I'm not ready for a relationship, Lois...
...but thank you for asking.
Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.
Your number still 911?
Alrighty, then.
Excuse me. Is Greg here?
Thank you.
What's the password?
New England clam chowder.
Is that the red or the white?
I never remember that.
White?
Hey, Woodstock.
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?
Super, thanks for asking.
I hope you're having a lovely day.
Do you?
Don't I?
So what are you up to?
Just watching the fishes, manoshevitz.
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.
I'm sending them new directional coordinates.
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...
...before they find any whales.
Gravy. So can you still...
...tap into the aquatic supply stores?
Of course. Why?
To trace the sale of any equipment...
...for moving or housing a dolphin recently.
Come on, I thought you had a challenge for me.
All right, we've got marine winch, sling, feeder fish 20,000-gallon tank...
Wait a minute, look here.
That's a lot of equipment for a civilian.
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.
Really?
That is the face of the enemy.
Always trying to get his greedy hands on endangered species.
Camp is connected with the Dolphins?
That's some genius, gave them the land the stadium's built on.
And look, he's throwing another "I'm the richest man in the universe" party.
Looks like it's time for me to get myself a date.
I'm going out on a limb here.
Camp's social events are strictly A-list.
The date started well, but she tensed up before we got to the party.
If you do anything embarrassing...
What? Like this?
Hi, Captain Stubing.
How are Gopher and Doc?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
I'm sorry, ladies.
- Melissa.
- Hi Ron.
Glad you could come.
Thank you.
You look wonderful.
And who is he, a friend?
This is my date.
He's a lawyer.
Well, does he have a name, or should I call him "Lawyer"?
I'm sorry. This is Ace V...
Tom Ace.
Pleased to meet you.
Congratulations on all your success.
You smell terrific.
One of the first things we learned...
...back at...
...Stanford was about the growth of food poisoning claims against wealthy people.
One could make quite a lucrative law practice...
...with little else.
How is everyone feeling tonight?
Very, very well, thank you.
Look, honey...
...there's the hors d'oeuvres.
See you.
Are you insane? There is no way that Camp stole Snowflake.
What are you trying to do?
Just keep him occupied while
I work my magic, please.
Smooshy, isn't it?
We got a few cases from my new dealer in Paris.
Excuse me...
...I need to use the bathroom.
I think it's the pate.
Sure, it's over there.
Stuff probably looks better on the way out.
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.
Gravy.
Don't worry, Snowflake.
Ace Ventura's here.
Yummy.
Snowflake.
Here, Snowflake.
I've got a snack for you.
They're wonderful aren't they?
Yes, they certainly are.
No matter what's going on in my life...
...I can watch them swim...
...and be totally at peace.
It's not Snowflake.
It's not Snowflake.
It's not Snowflake!
Are you sure your date is all right?
It's been a very long time.
Who, Tom?
Well, I'm sure he's fine.
Do not go in there.
I'm sorry. I'll have the plumbing checked immediately.
Do that. If I had been drinking out of the toilet, I might've been killed.
I'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.
What're you doing?
I'm sorry, Ron.
What's he doing?
Let's go!
Stop it.
I don't even want to know why your pants are missing.
I don't care what happened to you.
You could've cost me my job.
So you found a pebble in
Snowflake's tank. I'll call CNN.
I found it in the filter, thank you.
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare, triangular cut, orange amber.
What're you talking about?
Tonight I saw the same stone in Camp's ring.
I thought you said Camp didn't do it.
No, Camp's clean, his ring wasn't missing a stone.
But whoever was in that tank had a ring just like his.
Ring? What ring?
The 1984 Dolphin AFC Championship ring.
I find the ring with the missing stone...
...I find Snowflake.
How will you do that?
Simple.
Loser!
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?
You want to play?
Damn it.
That stone could be from anywhere.
It could've come from...
...a necklace or a pendant, an earring.
It came from an '84
AFC Championship ring.
Einhorn thinks it may have been an animal-rights group.
Do you know FAN?
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea, daughter of industrialist
Fisher Gamble?
Over half-a-million members worldwide?
No. Who are they?
Did you know that last year they sent 127 threatening letters...
...demanding the release of team mascots?
What do you feed your dog?
Dog food. Why?
He is miserable.
What are you talking about?!
He's just very unhappy, I feel sorry for him. Bad diet, isolated environment...
...it's amazing he's alive.
You're just mad because your stupid pebble theory didn't work out.
You can't express anger.
Yeah? And you're ugly.
I'm not even going to talk to you.
Please leave.
Why? So you can beat him?
Fatty.
You're unbelievable.
Hiring you was a big mistake.
Well, why don't you cry about it?
Saddlebags.
You like her, huh?
Yeah, she's all right.
Look, Melissa, I...
I am here at the North Beach Towers, a condo complex in north Miami...
...where Roger Podacter, Head of
Operations for the Miami Dolphins...
...has apparently committed suicide.
Allegedly leaping to his death from his 20th-story apartment...
You okay?
I told you, I was in my apartment...
...across the hall.
I heard a scream...
...so I called the manager.
The place was empty, except for the dog.
I opened the balcony door and looked out.
Splat, bang, pancake time.
Okay, thank you very much.
Hi, there.
Have a bad night?
So...
...animals can sense evil.
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.
This is police business. We'll let you know if the coroner finds a tick.
Face it...
Forget it, she's right.
Besides...
...I wouldn't want someone tracing my steps, pointing out my mistakes.
So...
...you don't think this is an obvious suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?
I wouldn't say that. There's evidence here to support your theory.
Except, of course, that spot of blood on the railing.
I'll tell you what I think happened.
Alrighty, then. Roger Podacter...
...went out after work, had a few drinks, then came home.
But he wasn't alone. Someone else was with him. There was a struggle...
...and he was thrown over that balcony.
Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide.
He was murdered.
That's a very entertaining story...
...but real detectives have to worry about that little thing called...
...evidence.
I think I heard a toilet flush.
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.
Well, I...
...guess I'm out of my league.
Good work.
There is just one more thing, lieutenant.
This woman is Roger's neighbor, she lives across the hall.
She said she heard a scream.
Right?
And you said you had to open the balcony door when you came in?
- That's true.
- You're sure you had to open this door?
I'm sure.
What's the point, Ventura?
Only this.
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...
...that neighbor could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down.
She heard screaming from in here...
...before he was thrown over the balcony.
The murderer closed the door upon going.
Can you not feel that, honey?
I have...
...exorcised the demons.
This house is clear.
- Losers.
- Get him out of here!
- Losers! Losers!
- Let's go, Ace.
Losers.
Come on.
Back to the zoo.
What're you thinking?
This whole thing is connected somehow.
I want to find that other ring.
Ace, you checked all the rings.
Receipts? What about receipts?
There's got to be receipts.
That was pretty impressive, what you did back at the apartment.
You don't have to tell me.
I was there.
Maybe you should've become a real detective.
I don't do humans.
You really love animals.
If it gets cold enough.
No, I have a kinship with them.
I understand them.
Want to hear something spooky?
One time when I was about 12, I had this dream I was being followed by...
...a dog with rabies.
He had bloodshot eyes...
...and foam came out of his mouth.
No matter how fast I ran, he just kept gaining on me, gaining on me.
Then just before I got to my front door...
...he jumped and sank his teeth in.
That's when I woke up...
...and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.
Bastard.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.
Want to know why I do this?
I'm not sure that I do.
You better be...
...because once you're inside my head...
...there's no turning back, baby.
So...
...are these all the receipts?
Maybe it's in another file in the back.
Who the hell is that?
What?
That.
Who the hell is that?
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?
Why isn't he in this picture?
This was taken earlier in the year.
Ray Finkle wasn't added until mid-season.
He missed the final field goal in the Super Bowl that year.
Cost the Dolphins the game.
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?
Definitely.
"Replacement kicker having a great year."
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."
"The kick heard 'round the world."
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.
Poor guy.
Poor guy with a motive, baby.
Where is he now?
Last I heard, he went back to his home town, Collier County.
Really?
You'll drop me off before you go, right?
No way, you shouldn't be alone right now.
It might not be safe at your apartment.
What do you suggest?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Three times.
Sorry, that's never happened before.
I must be tired.
Okay, I'm ready again.
I'm looking for Ray Finkle...
...and a clean pair of shorts.
What do you know about Ray Finkle?
Soccer-style kicker. Graduated from Collier High, June 1976.
Stetson University honors graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.
Most points and distance.
Former nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.
And one hell of a model American.
Are you another one of them "Hard Copy" guys?
No, sir.
I'm just a big Finkle fan.
This is my Graceland, sir.
Put that gun down.
The boy is a fan of our son.
So nice to meet you.
I'm Ray's mother...
...and this is Ray's father.
It's a real honor.
It's an honor to have you here.
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?
Oh, yes, I expect him home any minute.
Would you like some cookies?
I just baked them.
Yummy.
Ray Finkle's house.
I can't wait to meet him.
Ray ain't coming home.
Your wife expects him any minute.
She expects him home any minute.
See, the engine's running but there's nobody behind the wheel.
Eight years ago...
...our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.
And they're still bugging us to pick up his stuff.
It was all that Dan Marino's fault, everyone knows that.
If he had held the ball laces out, like he's supposed to...
...Ray wouldn't have missed that kick.
Dan Marino should die of gonorrhea and rot in hell.
Would you like a cookie, son?
What do you know?
They're little footballs.
Laces out.
When Ray comes back and starts kicking again...
...he'll never even know he was gone.
I've kept his room just the way he left it.
Oh, boy.
What a sports nut, huh?
May I?
Oh, yes, by all means.
Five seconds to go in this Super Bowl 17.
Dolphins trailing the 49ers...
...by one. This will win the game for Miami.
There's the snap.
Marino holds.
The kick...
...and it's high. No, it's...
...no good.
Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal.
I don't believe it!
Dolphins lose.
The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl.
- Melissa, it's Ace.
- Where are you?
I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's the mayor. Where's Marino?
Why?
Because he's about to join Snowflake.
I must know where he is!
He has a commercial shoot at the Bogart Sound Stage.
Call the police, get extra security over there now.
Ace, what's going on?
Thought I left?
I'm really going this time.
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.
Action.
I'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows the value of protection, it's me.
So I take care of the hands that take care of me...
...with Isotoner gloves.
Cut. Again from the top.
I said, cut.
It's a cut.
What the hell are they doing?
That's a cut!
Let's go!
- What is this, a rewrite?
- Shut up!
- Where'd they go?
- Over there!
Let's go!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Pet detective.
What's wrong?!
Can't you hit me?
Have there been ransom demands?
There's been no communication with the kidnappers.
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?
The game is on, as scheduled.
Why weren't we told about Snowflake?
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk public interference.
- Are the crimes related?
- I'm sorry, I can't comment further.
If you'll excuse me.
Get me Podacter's autopsy.
Aguado, send out a memo: no one talks to the press.
Someone, get me coffee!
Tonight on "Miami Vice,"
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!
When I get out of that bathroom, you'd better be gone.
Is it number one or number two?
I want to know how much time I have.
By the way, I went ahead and solved that...
...pesky Snowflake-Podacter-Marino thing.
Yeah, you ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?
All right, Ventura...
...make it quick.
I found a rare stone at the bottom of Snowflake's tank.
It belongs to a Dolphin '84
AFC Championship ring.
The Super Bowl when Finkle missed the kick.
Blames it on Marino.
We're talking paranoid, delusional psychosis. I saw the guy's room...
...cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?
My guess is Finkle was snooping around.
Podacter recognized him. End of story.
As for Snowflake, he was given Finkle's number, taught how to kick a field goal.
Finkle took it personally.
So where is Finkle now?
Busted out of a mental institute. He's been plotting his revenge for years.
Waiting for the perfect time to get back at the Dolphins.
The time when it'd hurt them most:
Super Bowl time.
Man, I'm tired of being right.
Congratulations.
You've done some fine detective work...
...Ace.
I'm sorry, could you speak into my good ear?
I thought I heard you call me Ace.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you're more than just a pet dick.
Your gun is digging into my hip.
What's wrong?
Want me to read you your rights?
Maybe later.
What is it?
That bony little bitch...
...Melissa Robinson?
You just don't do anything for me.
Down, boy!
Everything okay in here?
I heard some commotion.
Fine, sergeant.
Should I throw him out?
Why don't you throw yourself out?
Yes, ma'am.
Ace, I want you to leave everything to us.
I can't do that, lieutenant.
I was hired to find Snowflake.
When we find Marino...
...we'll deliver Snowflake.
When I find Snowflake...
...l'll deliver Marino.
Melissa, it's Ace.
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.
You have to commit me.
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have some of his stuff.
They won't let us just look around.
I know.
It's a good thing
I'm a master of disguise.
Mrs. Robinson...
...l'm Dr. Handly. Hi.
- Hi.
Now who is it you want us to look at?
My brother...
...Larry.
I'm ready to go in, Coach, just give me a chance.
I know there's a lot riding on it, but it's all psychological.
Just must stay positive.
I'm going to execute a button-hook pattern, Super slo-mo.
Let's see that...
...in instant replay.
Your brother won't be the first football pro here.
- Is that right?
- Yes, we're very sensitive...
...to the stress athletes must endure.
I'm open! I'm open!
I'm open!
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...
...but I think he'll fit in nicely here.
Over here!
Rover, sit. Hut, hut.
He seems to have some difficulty letting go of the game.
Has he a history of mental illness?
As long as I've known him.
This is one of our therapy rooms.
And we do arts and crafts out here in the courtyard.
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another...
Half-time!
He'll be fine there by himself for the next 20 minutes.
I'll show you the dormitories then.
Isotoners.
Obsess much?
Where are you going?
- To clean the storage room.
- No, clean the cafeteria.
I don't tell you how to do your job...
The schedule says...
...clean the cafeteria.
- I know what I'm doing, understand?
You should've cleaned it earlier.
Man, come on. Look, cafeteria, my ass. I'm cleaning in here.
Your breaks are too long.
Man, you're a pain in the ass.
"Search called off for missing hiker."
"A search ended today when rescue workers...
"...were unable to find the body of Lois Einhorn..."
A hiker missing since Friday?
Lois Einhorn?
Holy shitballs.
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work.
Love, Roger?
Ace, it's "E".
You think the article you found was something?
I got a note from Podacter to Einhorn...
...thanking her for a wonderful evening.
Something ain't stirring the Kool-Aid, man.
Wiggles, rewind.
What the hell does Lois Einhorn have to do with Ray Finkle?
Come on, think!
Finkle and Einhorn in it together.
How? Why?
All right. Here we go.
Answer's right there!
Must get blood to the brain.
Finkle and Einhorn. Finkle and Einhorn.
Finkle and Einhorn. Finkle and Einhorn.
Quitter.
What do you want?
I don't have any food for you.
I have to have money to buy food.
I have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?
Let's face it...
...your master is a loser.
What the...?
That's it.
That's it!
Einhorn is Finkle.
Finkle is Einhorn.
Einhorn is a man!
Oh, my God!
Einhorn is a man!
Your gun is digging into my hip.
God.
And the big story in this Super Bowl game...
...is the abduction...
...of Miami's starting quarterback, #13, Dan Marino.
It must be a strain on this Miami team, Bob.
What's wrong? Aren't you having fun?
I just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?
A magical afternoon...
...where dreams are made...
...and crushed.
If you want tickets, you're going about it the wrong way.
Do I look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if...
...we've met someplace before?
I don't know.
I get hit in the head a lot.
Now the coin toss.
Kickoff time.
My favorite thing.
Laces out!
I made some refreshments, Dan.
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?
I'll be right back, Dan.
I don't know how much Psycho Woman's paying you but I'll double it.
Sorry, Danny boy.
Psycho Woman keeps us out of prison.
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.
Check it out, Marino.
I'm throwing passes to a dolphin.
Damn.
Go get some more fish.
I could kill it.
Lovely party.
Pity I wasn't invited.
Where the hell are the smelts?
Unconscious.
Exactly as I planned.
What the hell was that?
Shit!
What happened?
What's going on?
You okay?
Guess what?
It's nap time.
What a hit!
Heads up!
Who are you?
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
I've been sent with a special play:
The "quarterback sneak."
Penalty.
Too many men on the field.
I warned you, Ventura.
Whatever happened to Ace?
Good question.
Be careful with that phone.
In time, you could develop a tumor.
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einhorn.
Send some men over to the Hallandale Yacht Basin.
I've got the kidnapper trapped in the warehouse.
It's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
Code 11 in progress,
343 Victorville Road...
...at the Palmdale Basin.
Officer needs backup.
Suspect's name: Ace Ventura.
Should be considered armed and dangerous.
It's Ace. We got to break out of here.
Is he in trouble?
Don't worry, if there's one thing I know...
...there's nothing Ace can't handle.
Don't kill me.
Please.
I'll never tell anyone, I swear.
- He's who you want! Kill him!
- Kill him!
- He held the ball, remember?
- Kill him, he's the detective.
Come on, look at him.
- Crybaby.
- Jock.
- Wimp.
- Musclehead.
Shut up!
I think I'll kill the dolphin first.
I wouldn't want you to miss that.
And there's the snap.
The kick!
And it's good!
Good to see somebody who doesn't buckle under pressure.
What do you know...
...about pressure?
Well, I have kissed a man.
Of course, there's never been a more crucial kick in a Super Bowl...
...than the kick heard 'round the world.
I mean, it's clear to me that it was a good hold. Finkle just booted it.
The laces were in!
They were in!
Oh, you like that?
You like that?!
And that! And that!
Having a little trouble with the lady?
You don't understand...
...she's a...
Get him, Lois! Get him!
Get him!
Get!
Shoot him!
- Shoot him!
- Hold your fire!
Don't shoot!
Put your guns down or this cop gets it.
I mean it!
She's not joking!
He kidnapped Snowflake!
He killed Roger Podacter and was about to kill Marino and...
...me!
Fiction can be fun.
But I find the reference section much more enlightening.
For instance...
...if you looked up...
...professional football's all-time bonehead plays...
...you might read about a Miami Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle...
...who missed a 26-yard field goal in the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.
You wouldn't read Finkle was committed to a mental hospital...
...escaped, and joined the police under the identity of a missing hiker...
...manipulating his way to the top in a scheme to get even with Marino...
...whom he blamed for the entire thing!
What are you talking about?
She's not Lois Einhorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!
He's lying!
Shoot him!
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?
Would a real woman have to wear one of these?
Boy, that's really on there.
But tell me this:
Would a real woman...
...be missing these?
That kind of surgery can be done over the weekend.
But I doubt very much...
...if he could find the time during his busy schedule...
...to get rid of...
...big old...
...Mr. Knish!
Oh, boy.
Come here.
Would you excuse me for just one second?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...
...brought new evidence to my attention.
Now...
...history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive...
...criminal investigator can be wrong from time to time.
But, if I am mistaken...
...if the lieutenant is indeed a woman...
...as she claims to be...
...then, my friends...
...she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!
That's why Roger Podacter is dead!
He found Captain Winkie!
Good night!
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.
Die, animal boy!
Quick decision.
Loser!
Do you have any more gum?
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the Miami Dolphins are proud...
...to welcome back to
Joe Robbie Stadium...
...our beloved mascot...
...and the star of our halftime show:
Snowflake!
And now...
...returning for the second half, the
Miami Dolphin's most valuable player:
Dan Marino!
Idiot!
Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.
Yeah? Blow me.
Really?
The National Football League...
...would like to offer a special thank-you...
...to the man who rescued Dan Marino...
...and our beloved Snowflake.
A great humanitarian...
...and a lover of all animals:
Mr...
...Ace... Ventura!
Excuse me!
Get off me!
Tone, put that big-ass size 13 on and kick it for the homies.
Claire.
I miss you.
Dr. Weir report te the Lewis & Clark in Docking Bay 4.
- Ion drive set.
- Thank you.
Heading: Vector One, nine degrees.
We are prepped for lockdown.
I can't believe it, this is ridiculous.
I haven't got more than my hand in the last six weeks, and now this shit.
I mean, why can't we go to Mars, Captain?
- I mean, Mars has got women.
- Smith's right.
Neptune, there's nothing out there.
Yeah, and if the shit goes down, we'll be on our own.
You know the rules, people.
Someone drops the ball, we get the call.
Now, let's go.
- Have you got our course plotted in?
- Yes, sir.
- Locked and cocked and ready to rock.
- Mr. Justin?
Everything's green on my screen,
Skipper.
Start your countdown now.
Ion drive will engage in T minus 10 minutes.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Let's go.
- Smith, you follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Justin, get those tanks prepped.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Cooper.
- Skipper.
- Ion drive in 10 minutes.
- It's time to play spam-in-the-can.
- Skipper.
- Peters.
Captain Miller,
I just wanted to say this is something...
Clock is ticking, Doctor.
You waiting for a personal invitation, there, Mr. Smith?
- No, sir.
- Captain, I don't want to take up...
Doctor, if you'll just follow the rest of the crew to the grav tanks, we're almost underway.
That bunk better be squared away,
Mr. Cooper, or you'll find yourself walking to Neptune.
What's the hold-up, Peters?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers, sir.
You stand right here.
Thanks, D.J.
- Hats off in the tank.
- Sir.
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.
I think your captain has some kind of a problem with me.
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.
He just loves having complete strangers on his ship.
- D.J.
- Yeah.
No.
Is this necessary?
When the ion drive fires, you'll be taking about 30 G's.
Without a tank, the force would liquety your skeleton.
I've seen the effect on mice.
Claustrophobic?
Very.
Biiiy.
I'm so aione.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Oh, God.
Biiiy?
I'm so coid.
Claire.
I'm waiting.
You're all right. Breathe. D.J.!
- Okay, Dr. Weir, let's get you up.
- Okay, I'm fine.
- Come on, take it easy.
- I'm fine.
Okay. There you go.
Now move nice and slow.
You've been in stasis for 56 days.
You're gonna experience a little disorientation, you understand?
- I'm all right now, thank you.
- Okay, take that. Don't rush it.
All yours.
You okay, Doc?
- Want some coffee?
- What?
Would you like some coffee?
No. Thank you.
All right, suit yourself.
What about you, Starck?
Would you like something hot and black inside you?
- Is that an offer?
- It is not.
- Then how about some coffee?
- Starck?
- Yes, sir.
- Why aren't you on the bridge?
Do you mind if I get dressed first?
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
I do mind if you get dressed first.
Let's go, people. We have a job to do.
Okay, Denny, here we go.
Happy birthday.
Piay horsey, Mommy. Piay horsey.
Hey, no more ball in the house.
You're the one who can't catch.
- Yo, apologize.
- Sorry about that, Mama Bear.
- All right.
- All right, then.
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.
I did try to find a replacement for you, but with such short notice, it was impossible.
I am sorry.
I talked to my ex.
He's going to take Denny for Christmas.
I'll get him for the summer, so everything's all right.
Smitty.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, in approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes, we'll be arriving in the orbit of Neptune.
Thank you very much.
- I thank you.
- That's good.
All boards are green.
Everything's five by five.
- U.S.A.C. Been notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, people, listen up.
- D.J.
As you all know, we have an addition to our crew.
Dr. Weir, you care to join us?
Introductions all around.
This is my XO, Lieutenant Starck.
Mr. Justin, Engineering.
The funky spaceman over here is Mr. Cooper.
What exactly is it you do on board this ship, Coop?
Listen up, Doc,
I'm your best friend, okay?
I am the lifesaver and the heartbreaker.
He's a rescue technician.
This is Peters, medical technician.
And my pilot, Mr. Smith.
The gloomy Gus in the corner over there, that's...
D.J. Trauma.
All right, all right.
Now we all know each other.
Skipper, I got a question.
What the fuck are we doing way out here?
Perhaps the good doctor will be kind enough to tell us.
Thank you.
First of all,
I want to say how much I appreciate
- this opportunity to join you on what I...
- It's for sure that you appreciate being here, Doctor, but you must understand that we don't.
We were taken off a well-deserved leave and sent into Neptune space.
We are now three billion klicks from the nearest outpost.
The last time U.S.A.C. Attempted a rescue this far past the outer reach, well, we lost both ships.
So, if you please...
Right. Well...
Everything I'm about to tell you is considered Code Black by the NSA.
U.S.A.C. Intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune.
The source of this transmission has been identified as the Event Horizon.
Yeah, well, that's bullshit, for starters.
- Skipper, you took me off leave...
- Thank you so much.
Smitty, sit down.
Cooper, as you were.
Let the man speak.
What was made public aboutthe Event Horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that her reactor went critical, and that the ship blew up, none of that is true.
The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight.
I don't... Excuse me.
See, you can't actually do that.
The law of relativity prohibits faster-than-light travel.
Relativity, yes.
We can't break the law of relativity.
We can go around it.
The ship doesn't really go faster than light.
What it does is it creates a dimensional gateway that allows it to jump instantaneously from one point of the universe to another light years away.
How?
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math.
- Try us, Doctor.
Right, well, using layman's terms, we use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
These in turn fold space-time, consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics, until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...
Layman's terms.
Fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?
Imagine, for a minute, that this piece of paper...
Excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.
Attractive piece of paper represents space-time and you want to get from point "A" here to "B" there.
Now, what's the shortest distance between two points?
A straight line.
Wrong.
The shortest distance between two points is zero.
And that's what the gateway does.
It folds space.
So that point "A" and point "B" co-exist in the same space and time.
When the spacecraft passes through the gateway, space returns to normal.
It's called a gravity drive.
- How do you know all this?
- I built it.
Well, I can see why they sent you.
So if the ship didn't blow up, then what happened?
Well, the mission was going perfectly, like a textbook.
They reached safe distance using conventional thrusters.
All systems looked good.
They had the go-ahead to use the gravity drive to open the gateway to Proxima Centauri and then, they just disappeared.
Vanished without a trace, until now.
Where's she been for the last seven years, Doctor?
That's what we're here to find out.
Now, we've been unable to verity life contact, but TDRS did receive this single transmission.
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.
Houston passed the same recording through several filters, managed to isolate what appears to be a human voice.
I'm not even sure if it qualifies as language.
- Latin.
- What?
I mean, I think it sounds like Latin.
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.
Right there. You hear that?
Sounds like, "Liberate me," something or other.
I can't make out the rest.
"Liberate me?"
Save me.
All right. Stations, people.
Crossing the Horizon.
Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.
- Come around to 334.
- Heading 334, sir.
Make your approach vector negative,
14 degrees.
1-4 degrees.
We have lock on Event Horizon's navigation beacon.
She's in the upper ionosphere and it looks like we're in for some very heavy chop, sir.
- Bring us in nice and tight, Mr. Smith.
- Sir.
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.
Matching speed on my mark.
Three, two, one. Mark.
- Range?
- 10,000 meters and closing, sir.
- Starck.
- Yes, sir.
Get on the horn.
See if anybody is listening.
This is the US Aerospace command vessel
Lewis & Ciark hailing Event Horizon.
Event Horizon, do you read?
Dr. Weir.
- I think you'll want to see this.
- Where is she?
Dead ahead. 5,000 meters!
- Starck? Anybody home?
- Event Horizon, do you read?
3,000 meters and closing!
I can't see a thing.
1,500 meters, sir.
We're getting too close.
- Where is it?
- The scope is lit. It's right in front of us.
- 1,000 meters.
- Proximity warning!
- We're right on top of her, sir!
- We're gonna hit.
- Starck!
- It's right there! God!
Reverse thrusters. Full!
There she is.
Jesus.
Very impressive ship, Doctor.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.
That's the main airlock, we can dock in there.
All right, Smith.
Use the arm and lock us onto that small antenna cluster.
We should go very carefully here.
That's not a load-bearing structure.
Is now, Doctor.
- Everything five by five?
- Locked in to the Event Horizon.
Thank you, Smitty.
Light them if you got them.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Starck, give me a read.
- The reactor's still hot.
We've got several small radiation sources, but no leaks.
Probably it's nothing serious.
- Do they have pressure?
- Affirmative.
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity, and the thermal units are off-line.
I'm showing deep cold.
The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
- Find them, Starck.
- Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.
Bio-scan on the line.
There's something wrong with the scan.
- Is it radiation interference?
- There's not enough to throw it off.
I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on their location.
These readings are all over the ship.
It doesn't make any sense.
Okay, we do it the hard way.
Deck by deck, room by room.
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.
Smitty, fire up the boards in the war room.
Sir.
Mr. Justin,
I believe you're up for a walk?
Yes, sir.
Doctor, I'm gonna need you here on the bridge.
Captain,
I didn't come out all this way just to sit on your bridge.
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship,
- we'll bring you on board.
- No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship.
That's the way it is.
I need you to guide us from the com station.
This is where I need you.
Help us do our job.
Honey, honey, you forgot your briefoase.
Stand clear.
- Anything gets funky, Cooper...
- I'll be on it.
Yo, Baby Bear, keep your nose clean.
D.J., showtime.
Video feed is clear.
- Are you with us, Dr. Weir?
- Yes, I'm with you.
We are crossing the umbilicus, making our approach to the Event Horizon.
You're at the outer airlock door.
Magnetic boots on.
We've got pressure.
Place is a deep freeze.
We got ice crystals everywhere.
That's the central corridor that you're in now.
It connects the personnel areas at the front of the ship to Engineering at the rear.
- Mr. Justin, you take Engineering.
- Yes, sir.
Peters and I'll take the forward decks.
Doctor, what are these?
Yeah, I've got another one over here.
They are all over the place.
In an emergency, they destroy the central corridor and split the ship in half and then the crew can use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
I'm in Medical. No casualties.
Place looks like it's never been used.
You stiii haven't seen any crew?
If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know it by now.
Scanning for life readings.
This place is a tomb.
Fuck me!
Miiier. Miiier, are you okay?
Looks like Skipper got a case of the willies.
Cooper, get back to your post.
Miiier, your heart rate just went through the roof.
I'm fine.
I think I've reached the door to the first containment, Dr. Weir.
The Engineering decks are on the other side.
Okay, let's take a look.
What the hell is this place, Dr. Weir?
It aiiows you to enter the second containment without compromising the magnetic fieids.
Looks like a meat grinder to me.
I'm on the bridge.
Got some blood here.
There must have been a coolant leak.
Man, this shit is everywhere.
Coolant level's on reserve, but well within the safety line.
Miss Peters, could you turn back and left?
- What is it?
- Ship's log.
It's stuck.
It's pretty jammed in there.
What the hell happened to his eyes?
- Explosive decompression.
- Decompression doesn't do that.
Looks iike it was caused by... i don't know, an animai or something.
Look at the damage to the soff tissue, massive abrasions.
Corpse-sicle.
I'm scanning for life forms.
Man, I'm getting some really strange readings in here.
Let me see if I can get some power up.
That's the core, the gravity drive.
The heart of the ship.
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.
Justin, come in.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
The life scan just went off the scale.
Something's wrong, Starck.
Pull him out. Pull him out.
Shit!
He's in trouble.
- Go, Coop.
- I'm gone.
Boarding party, sound off.
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?
- What the fuck was that?
- Pressure emergency!
We've lost the starboard baffle.
The hull's been breached!
I'll contain it here for as long as I can!
Get out!
We're losing atmosphere.
There are pressure suits in the airlock.
Go!
Here I come. Here I come.
Hold on, Baby Bear.
I'm almost there, almost there.
I got you. I got...
Watch out. Watch...
I got you. What the fuck is this?
Hold on.
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
- Smitty, where you been all my life?
- We have a major situation here, sir.
We've lost the starboard baffle, and the hull's been breached.
The safety circuits, they have failed.
- Do we have time for a weld?
- No, sir.
We've got 218 liters of gas left, sir, and then we've got nothing.
The oxygen tanks, they failed, they're broken.
- Sir, we are fucking dead!
- What about the Event Horizon?
What?
- She's got air and power.
- It's our only chance.
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard.
We don't even know what happened on that ship.
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.
I want all personnel on board the Event Horizon, pronto.
- We'll meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.
Bringing all thermal units online.
Hold tight. Prep for G's.
Gravity in five seconds.
Wake up, open your eyes. All right?
Just hang in there.
Dr. Weir.
Well,
I brought most primary systems online,
- for now.
- Thank you.
- Starck, what's our status?
- The antenna array is completely fried.
We've got no radio, no laser, no high gain.
No one's coming to help us.
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.
It's building up with every breath we take.
And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
So, we take the scrubbers from the Clark.
- That gives us what?
- Enough breathable air for 20 hours, but after that, we'd better be on our way home.
I'm on the port side of the hull, approaching the dorsal heat sink.
Holy shit.
Captain Miller. Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
I copy, Mr. Smith. How's my ship?
Sir, we've got a 7-meter fracture on the outer hull.
We shouid be abie to repair her, but it'ii take an awfui iot of time, sir.
Negative. 20 hours, we run out of air.
Understood, sir.
What happened here, Doctor?
Okay, how is he?
His vital signs seem stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli.
I don't know.
He might wake up in 15 minutes.
He might not wake up at all.
Look, Skipper,
I know this shit sounds weird, but, I mean, there was like nothing, and then Justin appeared, and it was liquid, and the whole core just turned solid.
It's just not physically possible.
Doctor, please. Please, don't start in with that physics shit.
I'm telling you, I saw it.
Mr. Cooper, it would mean the gateway was open.
- That's it. The gateway was open.
- The gateway couldn't be open because the gravity drive wasn't activated.
Look, I'm telling you what I saw, Doc!
So...
- It can't just start up by itself.
- Mr. Cooper, you are out of line.
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die.
Now, I have to assume that whatever happened to him could happen to all of us.
Mr. Cooper says he saw something.
I believe he saw something.
I need an explanation.
In my view, Mr. Cooper's delusional, if you don't mind my saying so.
But maybe he saw an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
"An optical effect"?
That's fucking poetic.
- Where the fuck...
- Cooper!
I'm sorry. All right.
Gravitational distortion.
What could create that, Doctor?
If, somehow, a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core, it could distort space-time.
It could make Justin seem to disappear.
It could also have damaged the Lewis & Clark.
- However, I think this is entirely unlikely.
- What's in the core, Doctor?
It's complicated.
How much time do you need?
We have,
17 hours and 48 minutes.
What's in the core?
This is the gateway.
Now, these three magnetic rings, when they align, it creates an artificial black hole which allows the ship to travel to any point in space.
A black hole, the most destructive force in the universe.
- And you've created one?
- Absolutely, yes.
Because we can use that immense power to bend space-time.
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark
1,000 years to reach our nearest star.
Butthe Event Horizon could be there in a day.
- If it worked.
- You can come down. It's perfectly safe.
So, if Mr. Justin was sucked through your gateway, he could've gone wherever the Event Horizon's been.
Theoretically, yes.
But as I told you before,
- the gateway can't just open by itself.
- I see.
Lieutenant, I want this room sealed off.
Second containment from here on in is off-limits.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, there's no danger.
The gateway's contained behind three magnetic fields.
- It's perfectly safe.
- Safe?
Doctor, my ship is in pieces and one of my crewmen may not make it home alive.
No one else goes near this thing.
Come on.
There's got to be something on this log.
You can do this.
D.J.?
- D.J., where are you?
- I'm up on Deck 4.
Mommy.
Peters!
What is it? You all right?
What's up? You was out there so long,
I thought you were trying to break my record.
Listen, I'd rather spend the next
12 hours outside than another five seconds in this shit can.
It's the final entry in the ship's log.
I want to say how proud I am of my crew.
I'd iike to name my station heads:
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.
We've reached safe distance...
This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.
...and we're preparing to engage the gravity drive, and open the gateway to Proxima Centauri.
Haii and fareweii.
- What is that?
- I'll run it through a few filters, see if I can clean it up.
- It's a power drain.
- It's the core.
Stay here. Look after Justin.
I don't want anybody else near that thing.
Wait for me, Doctor.
- What's causing the drain?
- Magnetic fields are holding.
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit.
I'll check it.
Can you give us a hand?
Justin.
Justin, can you hear me?
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?
The dark.
Yeah, that's the one.
Biiiy.
Miller!
Captain Miller!
I've got some problems here.
Be with me, forever.
Dr. Weir?
Carbon dioxide can produce hallucinations, impair judgment.
God damn it, D.J., it was not a hallucination.
All right.
Doctor, you were in the duct.
You must have heard something.
- You must have seen something.
- I did.
About an hour ago, I saw my son lying on the examination table
- and in his legs were...
- Miss Peters...
...crawling...
...if you don't mind my saying so, it sounds a little like shock.
- Could it be that you're traumatized...
- No. No.
...by seeing the body on the...
- Excuse me. No!
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.
She's right. Now, this was real.
I felt... I felt heat.
This is not something that's in our heads.
Smitty, have you seen anything unusual at all?
No, I haven't seen anything, and I don't need to see anything, sir, but I can tell you this ship is fucked.
Thank you for that scientific analysis,
Mr. Smith.
Well, you don't expect to figure it out, do you?
All right, Doc.
When you break all the laws of physics, you seriously think there won't be a price?
You already killed the last fucking crew.
And now you want to kill us as well!
- It's just a fucking ship, all right?
- D.J.!
It's just a ship, do you understand?
It's just a big hunk of metal.
- There's nothing odd going on.
- D.J.?
- Fine.
- D.J.?
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...
I'm sorry.
- Damn it!
- Smitty.
- It's all right. That's it.
- Fucking...
That's enough! I want you calm,
I want you cool! Now!
- All right.
- You're going back upstairs.
You're going outside on the Clark with Cooper, and you're going to repair the ship.
No mistakes.
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- Sir.
- Get moving.
- Miller.
- What is it, Starck?
I ran the bio-scan with the DNA-RNA filters.
The results were bio readings...
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes, I know.
Don't you have anything useful to tell me, Lieutenant?
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.
I think that there's a connection between the readings and the hallucinations, like they're all part of a defensive reaction, some sort of immune system.
I don't have time to listen to this.
- You have to listen to me.
- To what?
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us and the reactions are getting stronger.
It's as if the ship brought back something with it, a life force of some kind.
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?
You wanted an answer, and it's the only one I've got.
No, what I want, Lieutenant, is to survive the next 10 hours.
Justin?
Justin!
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?
- What's that?
- What is it?
- You heard it.
- What did you hear?
- What is it?
- Peters, listen to me.
It's D.J., all right?
I didn't hear anything.
Neither of us heard anything.
- So just calm down, all right?
- Okay.
- Get your breath back.
- Okay.
- Now, tell me.
- I was...
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Open the door.
Stop moving!
- No!
- Weir, stop. Stop him!
What're you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What is it?
The forward airlock.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, anyone in the airlock?
That's a negative, Starck.
Justin.
- Justin.
- Don't!
Justin, no!
Justin, no! Justin, open the door.
Miller, come in.
Miiier, come in. We have an emergency.
What's going on in there, Starck?
- Justin's in the airlock.
- Say again.
Justin is in the airlock and he is not wearing a suit.
- Shit. I'm on it.
- As you were, sailor.
- Skipper, you need me on this.
- I need you right where you are.
He's engaged the override.
- Can you shut it down?
- I'll try.
Coming to him, Starck.
Justin! Open this door, now!
Starck, give me status.
You better hurry.
He's engaged the override
- and we can't open the inner door.
- I'll get the kit.
Justin, open the door!
Justin, open the door.
- Did you hear it?
- Keep him talking.
Yes. Yes, I heard it.
Do you know what it is?
It shows you things,
- horrible things.
- What does?
The dark inside me from the other place.
- I won't go back there. I won't.
- No, Baby Bear.
- Come on, open the door.
- What's happening?
- I don't think she can talk him down.
- She'd better.
If he opens the airlock, he's going to turn inside out.
- No. You stay with me.
- Almost got it.
- I've almost got it.
- You stay with me, Justin.
Come on, now. Open that door!
If you could see the things I've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me.
No, that's not you talking.
That's not you talking.
That's it. That's it, right there.
Open the door. Go for that button.
Come on.
Okay.
No!
Captain, Justin just activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.
Justin!
Stand by for decompression in 25 seconds.
Where am I?
- Hey.
- Starck, get it fucking open!
- Hey, open the door.
- I can't.
The inner door won't open when the outside door's been triggered.
- It'd decompress the entire ship.
- Oh, my God.
Mama Bear, open the door.
Come on, please.
- Captain!
- Patch me through to him.
Captain Miller, tell them to open the door.
They can't do that, Justin.
- I don't want to die in here.
- You're not gonna die.
I want you to listen to me very carefully, and I'm gonna get you out of there.
Oh, my God.
It's starting.
- My eyes.
- Don't think about them. Shut them.
Just shut them as tight as you can.
Five seconds.
Tuck yourself into a crouch position.
Make yourself into a ball now.
I can't breathe. Ch, God.
Oh, God, it hurts.
I want you to huff and puff and blow all the air out of your lungs.
Do you hear me?
All the air out of your lungs, Justin.
Do it, now!
Okay, Baby Bear.
Got him. I got him. Stand by, people.
Standby.
- We've got pressure.
- We're coming, Justin. We're coming.
I'm going to need five units here.
Hold his head still.
Okay.
Give me some more glycerin, now.
One thing at a time, iet's keep him breathing.
Christ, he's bieeding out.
- Pressure's stiii dropping.
- Start the drip, 15 cc.
I've stopped the bleeding, stabilized him best I can.
He won't be pretty, but he should live
- if we make it back.
- We'll make it.
Starck, what's our time like?
CO2 levels will become toxic in four hours.
All right.
Peters, we've got to find out what happened to the other crew before the same thing happens to us.
I can work on the log on the bridge, but I won't go back to Medical.
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.
Justin said something about,
"the dark inside me."
What's that mean?
Doctor?
I don't think it means anything.
Don't you walk away from me, mister.
I'd like some answers, Doctor.
I'd like to know why one of my men tried to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an airlock.
I'd like to know what caused that noise.
Look, thermal changes in the hull could've caused the metal to expand and contract rapidly, causing reverberations.
This is possible.
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship.
You've given me nothing but bullshit.
What do you want me to say?
You said the ship's drive creates a gateway.
- Yeah.
- To what?
- I don't know.
- Where did it go?
- Where did you send it?
- I don't know.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Look, I don't know.
"I don't know," is not good enough, Doctor.
You're supposed to be the fucking expert.
I need answers. That's your job.
- Now, the other place, where is that?
- I don't know! I don't know!
Look, there's a lot of things happening around here that I don't fully understand. I need time.
I see.
Well, that's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Captain!
Don't ieave me!
Piease!
For God's sakes, heip me!
It's in your head.
It's just in your head.
God help us.
I'm telling you, it was his voice I heard.
He was calling to me.
A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.
We served on the Goliath together.
When the O2 tanks ruptured, four of us made it to the lifeboat.
But Corrick was still on board the Goliath when the fire broke out.
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?
It's beautiful.
It's like liquid.
It slides all over everything.
Comes up in waves.
And they just kept hitting him, wave after wave.
He was screaming for me to save him.
What did you do?
I did the only thing I could.
I closed the lifeboat hatch, and I left him behind.
I swore I'd never lose another man.
I've known you a long time.
- You never told me that.
- That's just it, D.J., I never told anybody.
But this ship knew about it.
It knows my fears. It knows my secrets.
Gets inside your head, and it shows you.
I wasn't going to tell you this.
I've been listening to the distress signal.
And I...
I think I made a mistake in the translation.
Go on.
I thought it said "liberate me."
Save me.
But it's not "me."
It's "iiberate tutume."
Save yourself.
And it gets worse.
There.
I think, that says "ex inferis."
"Save yourself,
"from hell."
Look, if what Dr. Weir tells us is true, this ship has been beyond the boundaries of our universe of known scientific reality.
Who knows where it's been, what it's seen, and what it's brought back with it.
From hell.
You don't believe in that kind of stuff, do you?
Whoever sent that message, he sure believes in hell.
Captain Miiier.
Whatever it is, Coop, it better be good.
Yes, sir.
Ready to repressurize the Clark and get the heii out of here.
On my way.
Come on, baby, don't let me down.
Hello, baby. Papa's home.
She's holding.
Oh, shit.
Skipper, we're still venting trace gasses.
Give me about 20 minutes to plug the hole.
Cooper, you are the iifesaver.
20 minutes and we're underway.
Shit.
- Got any coffee?
- Yeah, but it's cold.
Great.
Starck.
Miller?
We're leaving.
No, we can't leave.
Our orders are specific.
Rescue the crew, salvage what's left of the ship.
The crew is dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.
- We came here to do a job.
- We're aborting, Doctor!
Starck, download the files from the Event Horizon's computers.
D.J., I want you to get Justin prepped and ready to move him back to the Clark.
There's stuff I wanna get from medical.
We'd better move him in the tank.
No problem. Do it.
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to get the CO2 scrubbers back into the Clark.
- Take Smitty with you.
- Right.
Captain.
- Don't do this.
- It's done.
What about my ship?
You can't just leave her.
I have no intention of leaving her,
Doctor.
I will take the Lewis & Clark to a safe distance, and then I will launch tac missiles atthe Event Horizon, until I'm satisfied she's vaporized.
Fuck this ship.
Captain Miller, the bio-scan just went off the scale.
It looks like the core is draining power from the rest of the ship.
Get the files. Vacate.
I want off this ship.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
You just get your gear and get back on the Lewis & Clark Doctor, or you'll find yourself walking home.
I am home.
Let's go!
Ready?
Shot.
Come on.
- Ready?
- Shot.
- Shot.
- Okay.
Peters, can we go?
This place is really freaking me out.
Yeah, you wanna breathe on the way home.
- No, I don't! Let's go!
- Shit!
- Come on!
- We need 25.
- Peters!
Come on! Got it!
Oh, no. Peters.
Oh, God.
Biiiy.
Claire?
Claire.
It's me. I'm home.
I'm home.
I know I wasn't there when you needed me, and I'm sorry I...
I let my work come between us.
God, Claire, no.
I'm begging you, please. Please, don't.
Not again, please.
I've been so...
Billy.
It's all right.
- I've been so alone.
- You'll never be alone again.
You're with me now. You're with me and I have such wonderful, wonderful things to show you.
Damn, I'm good.
Coop.
Coop, how long are you going to take?
'Cause I've got to get the heii out of here.
Look, you can kiss my ass, Smith,
'cause I'm done.
Just give me a second to collect my tools and we can get out of Dodge.
- Two minutes tops.
- Roger that.
Weir.
Dr. Weir.
Weir!
Dr. Weir, get your ass back on board now!
Weir!
Shit.
Captain Miller,
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
Captain Miiier.
Captain Miiier, do you copy? Over.
Go ahead, Smitty.
I've just seen Weir messing around on the Clark sir.
Stand by, Smitty,
I wanna check something out.
- Smith, get out of there.
- Come again, sir?
One of the expiosives is missing from the corridor.
- Weir might have put it on the Clark.
- No. No way.
No, sir, no way.
I've just put it back together, sir.
Get off the Clark now, Smith!
Where the fucking hell are you?
Got you.
Hang on, Smitty. I'm coming!
No!
Shit!
Where the fuck am I going?
Why does this shit got to happen to me?
Fuck.
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think.
All right, I got to get back to the ship.
I got to get back to the ship, all right.
I gotta blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.
All right. Fuck.
This better work. This shit better work.
All right.
Here I go. All right.
One, two, three. Come on.
Come on. Yes!
Here I come, motherfuckers!
D.J.
- What was that?
- Clark's gone.
- Smitty and Cooper are dead.
- What? What the... it was Weir.
You spot him, you take him out.
Understood.
- Be carefui, D.J.
- Don't worry about Weir.
I'll take care of him.
D.J.?
D.J.? D.J., answer me!
Okay, Dr. Weir.
You don't wanna leave your ship?
You never will.
Starck.
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay.
Easy.
Oh, my God.
What happened to your eyes?
Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What are you talking about?
I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars.
But she's gone much, much further than that.
She tore a hole in our universe, a gateway to another dimension.
A dimension of pure chaos, pure evil.
When she crossed over, she was just a ship.
But when she came back, she was alive.
Look at her, Miller.
Isn't she beautiful?
Your beautiful ship killed its crew, Doctor.
Well, now she has another crew.
Now she has us.
What do you think you're doing, Doctor?
You wanted to know where the ship has been, so now you'll find out.
- If you miss me, you blow out the hull.
- What makes you think I'll miss?
That's right, I'm back!
I'm... Shit, I can't stop. Hey!
Hey! Fuck.
What? Who the fuck? Oh, shit!
Miller! Miller!
Give me your hand!
- Come on!
- I can't!
I'm not leaving you.
Forward airlock.
It can't be Weir.
I'm not taking any chances.
You watch your back.
- Yo! Don't hit me.
- Cooper!
Take it off! Take it off!
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- You're okay.
- You're okay. It's over.
- No, it's not.
Weir's activated the gravity drive.
We got to shut it down.
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?
You think you can shut it down from there?
I don't know the process.
Dr. Weir was the expert.
I don't want to go where the other crew went, okay?
- I'd rather be dead.
- Okay.
- Okay, we blow the fucker up.
- We blow it up?
Do like Weir said. Blow the corridor, separate us from the rest of ship.
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
With any luck, TDRS will pick up our emergency beacon.
We prep the gravity couches, put ourselves in stasis, and stand by for a search and rescue team.
Meantime, I'm gonna go manually arm these explosives.
- Skipper, will this shit work?
- It worked for Dr. Weir.
You go activate the emergency beacon.
You get back here double-quick.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll come with you.
You stay here.
You prep the gravity couches.
Miller.
Close this door behind me, Lieutenant.
Gateway opening in T minus five minutes.
Emergency beacon activated.
Yes.
Blood?
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me.
Starck!
Run!
Gateway opening in T minus three minutes.
Detonator reiease is authorized.
The main corridor is now armed.
We're armed. She's ready to blow.
I repeat, we are armed.
She's ready to blow.
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?
We have to get out of here now.
You let me burn.
Gateway opening in T minus two minutes.
Miller.
You left me behind.
No, you're not Edmund Corrick.
I watched him die.
Weir?
The ship brought me back.
I told you she won't let me leave.
She won't let anyone leave.
Did you really think you could destroy this ship?
She's defied space and time.
She's been to a place you couldn't possibly imagine.
And now,
- it is time to go back.
- I know, to hell.
You know nothing. Hell is only a word.
The reality is much, much worse.
Now let me show you.
Help me!
No!
No.
- You see?
- No.
They're not dead. They're not dead.
Not yet.
You won't take my crew.
They're not your crew anymore.
They belong to the ship.
Gateway opening.
Take me.
You take me. You leave them alone.
No. There is no escape.
The gateway is open, and you are all coming with me.
Do you see?
Yes,
I see.
No!
Miller.
This is Rescue One. We have contact.
Approaching the wreckage of the Event Horizon.
Prepare to board.
I'm entering the grav couch bay.
It doesn't appear to have been damaged in the explosion.
There appear to be three survivors:
Cooper, Justin, Lieutenant Starck.
Justin seems to have suffered massive injuries but he's still alive.
The grav couches still have power.
I'm opening the first tank now.
It's all right. It's okay.
- You're safe now.
- Justin, Cooper.
They're fine. They're with us.
They're with us.
- Starck. Starck.
- Stay calm. It's all right.
- Calm down, it's me.
- Breathe deeply.
- Starck.
- Breathe deeply.
- It's the rescue team.
- I need a sedative here, now!
- I got you, Starck. I got you.
- It's okay.
I need a sedative here, now!
Starck, it's the rescue team. We're safe.
- Okay, okay, I need it now!
- We're safe.
[Peter Arnett]
You may hear the bombs now.
If you’re still with us, you can hear the bombs now.
They are hitting the centre of the city.
[Second reporter]
Now we can hear explosions...
..off in the distance to the west of central Baghdad.
Clearly I've never been there,...
..but this feels like we 're in the centre of hell.
[President Bush] The 28 countries...
..with forces in the Gulf area...
..have exhausted all reasonable efforts...
..to reach a peaceful resolution,...
..have no choice...
..but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force.
[Iraqi spokesman]
A great battle has been initiated.
The mother of all battles.
[Bush] Our objectives...
..in the Persian Gulf area clear,...
..our goals defined.
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait...
..completely, immediately,...
..and without condition.
[Bush] The liberation of Kuwait...
..has now entered a final phase.
I have therefore directed to use all forces available,...
..including ground forces,...
..to eject the Iraqi army from Kuwait.
[Peter Arnett]
At this point it seems inevitable...
..that the ground war is only hours away.
Peter Arnett, Baghdad.
Don't ever for one minute underestimate the enemy,...
..but remember, we're better soldiers.
We're fighting with better equipment, we're better trained and a lot smarter.
Sleep deprivation.
Our soldiers been up 46, 48 hours,...
..so stay on top of 'em.
Maintain your intervals.
Any questions?
Let's have a Little prayer.
Dear God, protect us...
..as we protect our country we so dearly Love.
Keep us safe that we’ll all get home to see our families and our children.
Amen.
Amen.
- Let's kill 'em all.
- [all] Hu-ah!
You all right, Boylar?
Hell, yeah.
- Let's heat 'em up, Nat.
- See you in Baghdad.
Yes, sir.
Battle-carry Sabot.
Sabot bullet coming up, sir.
- Sabot loaded.
- Indexed.
Crew report.
- Driver ready.
- Loader ready.
Gunner ready to give Saddam a new way to hurt.
- Hu-ah!
- Hu-ah!
Hu-ah.
All right, Boylar?
Roger that.
All Cougar elements, this is Cougar-6.
Report Red Con 1. Over.
All Sabre elements, this is Sabre-6.
Move out.
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
No joy over here.
Permission to try an alternate route. Over.
Roger that, Cougar-6.
Work your way to phase line hammer.
- [Nat] No surprises. Copy?
- Roger that.
I'm taking up the right flank.
I’ll get back to you. Out.
Contact. I see flashes, 3,500 metres, sir.
- All right.
- Hold on. They got no range.
2,500 metres and closing, sir.
Ready to lase and blaze.
Contact, sir. He's in range.
- Come on, let me kill his ass.
- Fire!
On the way!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Find me another target, Patella.
- Loaded!
- Identified.
- Fire.
Fire!
[Patella] Got him! We got him!
Sabre-6, Liberty-6.
We got enemy tangos retreating...
..vicinity grid 2-4-9er-8.
Your pursuit should intercept their retreat, grid 7-6-5.
Roger that, Liberty-6.
- Troops!
- Troops!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Come on! Come on!
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
Go ahead, Cougar-6.
I have got mines. Repeat, mines.
I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[Nat] Work your way to grid-line Charlie.
Cougar-6 to all Cougar elements.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Whoa! What the...
Oh, shit!
All Sabre units, this is Sabre-6.
We just lost a tank.
Anybody see the shooter?
- I didn't see anything.
- Where they coming from?
Who the hell is shooting at us?
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks...
..retreating grid 7-6...
- Patella, that one of our tanks?
- Hard to tell.
Make it out, and fast!
Oh, shit! We're almost browning out.
Nat, what's happening?
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks on our flank. We have contact.
This is Cougar-6.
Enemy tangos at phase line delta. Over.
- Patella, find me a target.
- I think I got one, sir.
Do you or do you not have a target?
I think so!
Gunner, Sabot, tank.
Identify! Up!
Fire!
He just fired, sir.
They're firing at us!
- Loader!
- Up, sir!
Fire!
Yeah! That's the one!
All right.
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.
- We got him.
- Sabre, you just lit up a friendly!
I heard you! We... what?
Oh, my God.
You just lit up Boylar, goddamn it!
Sabre-6, Nat, what's happening?
Patella, was that one of our tanks?
He fired, sir.
At us or at the T-72s?
I don't know.
At us or at the T-72s?
I don't know!
[Patella] Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Colonel Serling, report status now.
They have range on us, sir.
Sir!
Oh, Christ, Colonel...
I gave the order to fire.
So with your thermal equipment,...
..confused by burning tanks and smoke obscuring your visual ID,...
..you couldn't tell the difference between the T-54 and the Abrams.
I believe that, uh, we...
I should have known the difference,...
..even with the night scope.
If we weren't under attack,...
But, under the circumstances, there was no way to tell the difference.
Under the circumstances,...
..I suppose there was no way to tell the difference, but...
There was no way to tell the difference.
Thank you, Colonel.
That's all we need.
[Patella] We’re almost browning out!
[Boylar] We got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.
Aah!
We just lost Cougar-6!
You just lit up a friendly!
Colonel Serling?
Yes.
You OK? Can I get you something?
Yes, I'm fine. Fine.
Uh, yes, you can get me a cup of coffee.
You got it.
We missed you and Meredith at Banacek's party last night.
I'm too old to dance with you youngsters.
Meredith's not, so tell her to come without you next time.
Oh, OK. I will do just that...
..next time.
Colonel Serling.
- Hershberg in five. Coffee's coming.
- Thanks.
Yes.
Washington Post?
About?
Yes, I was there.
That's a matter of public record.
Well, thank you very much, Mr...
Gartner. Thank you, Mr Gartner, but I have nothing to say.
No, sir.
No, sir!
Well, I’ll do just that.
Right.
Colonel Serling's here, sir.
Ban.
I'm not talking to you.
Won't even come to my anniversary party?
You and Sylvia have been together, what, a month?
The way she danced with that marine, it won't last another week.
It may be my last anniversary party.
Were you there for me?
What's up?
Hey, Nat.
I've got to talk to you.
How we holding, Ban?
Running late, sir.
- May I run a few things by you, sir?
- Quickly.
Lieutenant Boylar's parents...
Boylar?
Tom Boylar. He died in AI Bathra.
He'd been with me a long time.
- From Virginia, right?
- Roger that, sir.
His parents have written to me.
They're hearing rumours.
You know we can't discuss it.
You have to put them off.
- Yes, sir, but...
- Tell them he died in action.
He's a hero. That's all they want to know.
Roger, but it's not just his parents.
We got a call...
..from the Washington Post.
A reporter named Gartner.
A reporter called you about AI Bathra?
You didn't talk?
Of course not.
Nobody’ll hang you out to dry.
I won't let 'em.
Did you listen to the tape, sir?
Colonel, the war's over.
You and I have been given the great responsibility and privilege...
..of investigating combat medals for our army.
In other words, we've been passed over.
I prefer to think of it as a second chance, Nat.
We understand each other?
Yes, sir.
OK.
The White House heard we're considering the Medal of Honour for a chopper pilot...
..who saved some guys on a downed Blackhawk.
- Naturally they want it for Veterans Day.
- Naturally.
Which is why you're taking over the inquiry.
We've got the rescued soldiers in there for debriefing.
Attention.
Morning. Take your seats.
Everything in order?
- Just going over the sequence of events.
- Bring Colonel Serling up to speed.
Morning, sir.
Good to see you again.
Could we get a picture of you and the survivors?
No, thank you.
- Keep me in the loop.
- Thank you, sir.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Doug Bruno, White House.
Do everything my way and we’ll be fine.
Nat Serling.
I’ll, uh, get out of your way.
- Major.
- Sir.
25 February, these men were part of a refueling convoy.
Their Blackhawk was shot down by an SA-7 west of Al Kufan.
Five seconds after it locked on, we were down.
We didn't know what hit us.
Our lines were surrounding them so fast,...
..we got caught in a pocket of resistance.
Iraqi ground troops on the ridge above kept them completely pinned down.
Did you discuss surrendering?
Yes, sir, we did.
We were all wounded one way or another.
We weren't trained for that kind of situation, sir.
Don't have to make excuses to me.
Go on, Sam.
That's all we got so far, sir.
OK.
- Lieutenant Chelli.
- Yes, sir.
Well, as if things weren't bad enough already,...
..one of their T-54s...
..joins the ragheads up on the ridge.
Incoming! Get down!
That round kills the medic, Relleno, Gerspach,...
..and, uh, Egan here lost his leg.
So we figure that's it. We're dead.
But then we hear it.
Nothing like the sound of an inbound Huey.
Yeah!
Yeah!
[Serling] This Huey, did it take any fire?
Right off the bat.
But this time when the Huey comes back, it returns fire.
Ground troops go for cover.
Then the Huey circles back over the tank...
That's when they threw something overboard.
- Threw something, or something fell off?
- I couldn't tell, but the tank blew.
Oh!
Yeah!
Man, did it ever blow!
We, uh, we never did see what knocked the Huey down.
We couldn't see the crash.
That night we caught sporadic ground fire.
The Huey was down below, between us and the enemy,...
..so they caught most of it.
Any communications between you and them?
No, sir. As I said, our radio was wasted.
Shouting just draws enemy fire.
So the Iraqis, they start to close in on the Huey...
..under cover fire,...
..and the Huey returns fire.
We figure it's all over, and that's when we hear the rescue team.
Cobras, Hueys...
And a big-ass A-10 Thunderbolt.
I swear I never heard such a sweet sound.
But now the fuckers are...
I'm sorry, sir.
The Iraqis are letting loose with all they got.
You were right the first time.
Plus the Huey crew is still banging away.
We load our wounded aboard,...
..and that's when somebody decided to leave the dead.
I guess it was the commander of the rescue.
Mm-hmm.
And this... Huey crew,...
.they, uh, they returned fire all through the final rescue?
Yes, sir. I... I think so.
I couldn't see much, though.
I heard it.
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not no A-K or M-60.
I heard it, too.
The last thing we see is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm on the downed choppers.
I don't know if it was Captain Walden...
..but that Huey...
..saved our lives.
It sure sounds like it.
OK.
Thank you for your help.
I’ll look over your statements.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Colonel.
That’ll be all.
- Got something for me?
- I do, sir.
Walden's 201 file. Evaluation reports.
You know I'm going to need background on these guys.
Make sure we don't have a wife-beater or an illegal Allen or gays.
That’ll blow it.
About this Congressional Medal of Honour.
It's not the Congressional Medal of
Honour. It's just the Medal of Honour.
Tell that to Congress.
If Captain Walden wins this medal...
You don't win it. You, uh, receive it.
It's not a contest.
But that is perfect. That is why I'm here.
I'm not here to get down your throat, make you crazy,...
..take these facts and twist them.
I just want to get these nuances out of your head and to get it straight from you.
- It's a woman.
- You didn't know?
What did you think the hoopla was about?
Banacek's got information on three of Walden's men.
- The crew chief we're still tracking.
- This is Captain Karen Emma Walden.
She's the first woman ever to be nominated for a Medal of Honour for combat.
I mean, this is gold.
It's gold.
Unfortunately it's posthumous,...
..but I've got her Little daughter.
I got the President of the United States.
It's all set in the Rose Garden.
The President's going to lean down and hang that ribbon round that pretty face.
There is not going to be a dry eye from Nashua to Sacramento.
Excuse us.
OK, it was 5 to 1,...
..hook shot.
Me and her are cheerleaders.
- More mashed potatoes.
- [Woman] Sorry, no more potatoes,...
..but how about some bread?
Aah!
[Boylar] Aah!
Daddy, can I have your mashed potatoes?
Daddy?
Sir?
Can I have your mashed potatoes?
M... Yeah. Sure.
Yeah,...
..soldier.
You want 'em all?
That enough?
More?
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, who is calling, please?
Just a minute.
It's for you.
Who is it?
Somebody Gartner.
Want some more peas?
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
Fort Hood.
General Hershberg's got me investigating a Medal of Honour.
It's a woman.
Good for her.
Posthumous.
Too bad, but still good for her.
Mmm. Too bad.
You talk to the investigators today?
Right.
It's all right, isn't it, Nat?
Yeah. Fine.
How long are you gone for?
Couple of days.
Then why are you emptying your sock drawer?
I may be gone more than a couple of days.
Nat.
Yes.
I don't know what's happening.
Everything's fine.
I'm handling it.
[Nat] Mr. Rady, you were Captain Walden's copilot.
That's right.
[Nat] Can you tell me what you remember about Al Kufan?
I remember the earth.
I remember... llario's face.
I wish...
- She hadn't needed to be a hero so bad.
- That's not fair.
We were just doing our job.
It's not Ren's fault I got hit.
She sure as hell saved the lives of those guys on the Blackhawk.
- You always defend her.
- Why didn't you like her?
She was so butch.
Honey, shut up.
She was, you know.
One of those women who want to be officers...
Annie, shut up.
She gave her life for those men.
She was a soldier.
There she blows.
- We're taking fire!
- Holy shit!
- Kill that motherfucker, Bonfires!
- I may as well be pissing on him.
- We need a fucking air strike!
- We got no fucking bomb!
- Making another pass, Ran?
- Yep.
No! We should go for altitude, and call for support.
After we slow down that tank!
- How we gonna do that?
- Shut up and listen, soldier!
Altameyer, unhook the aux fuel bladder port side.
Get ready to push it overboard.
Push it overboard, ma'am? llario, unhook the flare gun!
What the fuck...
Do it!
It's a bomb, asshole!
Target coming up!
Gimme more!
Ready here!
- Got it?
- I got it!
Tell us when you're there!
He’ll kick it!
Allow for the speed of the craft!
- The pod will drop at the same velocity!
- He knows.
Pick your moment!
Now!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Whoa! Shit!
Whoa! Oh, God!
Hang on, llario! Grab a hold of me!
Don't let go of me! Pull me in!
Hang on.
Come on, llario! Pull yourself up!
Do something!
No! No! Rady, call in a Mayday! llario,... call it in!
[Ilario]
Mayday! Dustoff-3... we are going down!
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! Mayday! Mayday!
This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We are going down!
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!
We're going down! Oh, my God...
That's it.
I woke up three days later on a hospital ship.
Nearly bought it, that's sure.
[Larry King] When did you decide the type of career in the Army you wanted?
[Schwarzkopf] That happened about my third year at West Point when I was...
I could have gone in the Air Force.
I stood high enough in my class.
You can't get away from that guy.
He's everywhere.
- Hell of a soldier, though.
- You think so?
I know so.
Really. How?
I was with him in the Gulf.
No shit.
- Doing what?
- Armoured cavalry.
Hu-ah.
Hu-ah.
Once upon a time,
I was humping in the delta.
- With who?
- The 9 Th.
- You kicked some serious butt.
- That's right.
- One for my friend...
- Colonel Nat Serling.
Make it a double for Colonel Serling.
Tony Gartner, Washington Post.
They won't find any criminal culpability in the AI Bathra incident.
You got nothing to worry about.
Those were my men.
I put that badly. I'm sorry.
Look, I went to Virginia and spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Boylar.
You what?
I'm sorry, but they got a right to know what happened to their son.
I’ll take that.
[Serling] And this
Huey crew, they, uh, returned fire all through the final rescue?
[Chelli] Yes, sir. I think so.
I couldn't see much.
[Thompson] I heard it.
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not know A-K or M-60.
[Egan] I heard it, too.
[Chelli] Last thing we see is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm...
..on the two downed choppers.
Oh!
Sir!
All right, this is anti-fungal cream,...
..but to kill the athlete's foot when you're in the shower, just piss on your feet.
That's disgusting.
What've you got for me today?
You want to get rid of the allergies to bee pollen, then no caffeine, no chocolate.
Jesus. I give up coffee, you can bury me now.
- Morning, Colonel.
- Morning. You got some aspirins?
How many do you want?
I take eight every day.
Four's good.
- I need to talk to you, Specialist.
- Sir?
I'm investigating the recommendation to award a Medal of Honour to Captain Walden.
Rowtero?
Yeah?
Can you cover for me?
I'm going to go feed the cancer genes.
Do you really need to, uh, I mean...
It's fine.
Uh, what do you want to know?
How long were you with Captain Walden?
Um... over... over two years.
Quite a long time.
Yeah.
You were her medic.
Yes, sir.
I don't fly any more though.
Well, don't miss it, do you?
Never.
Never again.
That's quite a habit you got.
Yeah, it's, uh...
..one of the few things I can call my own.
So...
..tell me what happened at AI Kufan.
See, I'd, uh...
..I'd never been in... in combat.
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down!
Mayday! This is Dustoff-3... llario?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Rady's hurt.
Monfriez?
AItameyer?
Functioning.
Fire in the hold!
[Ilario] Come here, buddy.
This is Dustoff-3.
Acknowledge.
This is Dustoff-3.
Here. Come on.
This is Dustoff-3.
Come on.
Dustoff-3. Acknowledge.
AItameyer, how's that fire?
Under control. Fuel tank's intact.
Enemy at the back door!
Come on! Come on!
Monfriez, get that saw working!
Come on! Get down!
I've got the M-16! llario?
He's bad. It's the lung.
We gotta get him out of here.
- Head wound?
- Superficial. How's the radio?
Dead. So's the ADT.
Monfriez, easy on the ammo!
We might be here a while!
Captain!
You've seen me do this a million times.
You’ll be fine.
Ammo?
I got this belt and three more boxes.
OK, AItameyer, rip out everything you can from the inside.
We're gonna make a perimeter.
Monfriez, cover us!
Go!
Where's our Kevlar?
I got one!
Well, put it on!
Unh. How's he doing?
He's the same.
I need a hook.
As soon as it gets dark, we dig in.
Then we wait.
For what?
For the good guys.
You won't think it's so funny when I nail your fucking ass!
Yeah, they were laughing.
You about, uh... You done?
So tell me what happened...
..during the night.
You were there. You saw the nights.
You know, just... it was black.
Just... black.
Tell me what happened that night.
Well, she put us on two-hour watches.
Um... it's not like any of us were going to sleep anyway.
[Monfriez]
Head down, AItameyer. You might lose it.
You OK, Captain?
Shit in my eye.
Will our guys come tonight?
They’ll be here.
Dust is blowing pretty bad.
I don't know how much longer Rady can hang on.
I can hear the rag heads when you're not gabbing.
Then I'd suggest everybody just...
They're going away.
It was just a probe. llario?
I'm OK.
AItameyer?
My ear!
Monfriez?
I... I took one.
- Rady?
- Hanging in. How about you, Cap?
Unh...
Oh, shit.
Stay with Rady.
I like to come here.
It's not just the bikinis, although they ain't bad.
It's these kids.
I like to watch them, you know?
My folks had this place out on Calaveras Lake.
I still go there sometimes, watch 'em dive.
They do the damnedest things.
They never think about the consequences.
Imagine that.
Imagine not thinking about the consequences?
Imagine that.
Are... are we done?
After the attack...
..during the night...
What?
I mean, we waited.
I... I still don't...
- I... I don't know what you...
- Just go on with what happened.
Well, Karen,... the captain,... uh, was hurt pretty bad.
Ohh...
Unh...
Unh!
How many rounds left?
Just a sec.
How many rounds?
I just opened my last can of ammo.
Five mags for the M-16,...
..9-mll's full.
Mine's empty.
Fire a couple of rounds off.
- Let 'em know we're still alive.
- Roger that, Captain.
Now save your ammo for something you can see.
During the course of the incident, did she display any doubt, any fear...
..when she had to make these life-and-death decisions?
No.
No. Never.
She just made 'em.
Just like that?
Just like that.
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.
The heavier the pressure, the calmer she got.
We knew they were out there,...
..sneaking up on us.
But we also knew at first light they were going to attack.
I don't know why people think only good things happen when the sun rises.
Incoming!
How many?
100. Maybe more.
Any good at hand-to-hand?
Wait till they get closer.
Make every round count!
- Shit!
- Quiet!
What in Christ for?
They know we're here!
Quiet! I hear something!
Choppers!
Hey!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Go! Go!
Yeah!
Let's get out of here! llario, get the captain!
There's the rescue!
Help Rady!
Pick him up!
Go! Let's go! Let go! Let's go!
Come on! Let's move! Move it!
Gotta go! We gotta go!
Come back for me with a stretcher!
Go! llario, let's get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
Aah!
Aah!
Medic!
Come on! Get him up!
Move! Come on! Let's go!
Where's Walden?
Captain Walden is dead.
Strike leader, this is Dustoff-6.
We have all the friends.
You're clear and hot.
Roger, Dustoff-6. Going on down.
So...
Is she gonna get it?
Is she gonna get the medal?
Well, I sincerely hope so.
I just... I don't want to tell that story again.
Not one more time.
Yeah, I understand.
May I be excused?
Yes, you can.
Oh, one more thing I'm confused about.
This M-16...
What?
Did it run out of ammo?
Uh, what did I say?
I don't remember. That's why I'm asking.
I guess, uh...
I guess it ran out of ammo sometime during the morning.
Um...
Or, no, sometime during the night...
I don't know.
See, the Blackhawk crew said they heard M-16 fire...
..during the rescue that morning.
Did they?
That's right.
Must've been wrong, then.
Them or you?
Who, them or you?
Oh, them. Them, yeah.
No, they must have been wrong.
OK.
OK.
What about the letter?
A what?
You and Walden traded letters to send home in case anything happened to you.
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.
So, who was hers to?
Her folks.
- So you sent it?
- Yeah.
Her folks, they're good people.
They got a farm out in Abilene.
They'd come to Hood, look after her kid while we went out on exercises.
Yeah... Yeah.
OK.
Thank you, Specialist.
Thank you very much, sir.
I read somewhere...
..that if a child doesn't see a person die,...
..or dead, like in a casket,...
..that the person isn't really dead for them.
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
Yes, ma'am.
It was, uh... unusual, wasn't it,...
..for Karen to want to be a helicopter pilot?
I guess that's my fault.
I took her to the fair when she was 11.
12 - 7th grade.
Anyway, there was a helicopter there.
Small one with a bubble up front.
The fella... the pilot was selling rides.
I bought Karen a ticket.
It was a short ride.
But when she came down...
Well, I don't think she ever came down, actually.
She showed up at the dinner table one day,...
..just after she finished TCU.
She's joined the Army.
She wants to fly helicopters.
She's real stubborn about it, too.
That's our Karen, you know, stubborn.
So's Anne Marie here.
Come here, honey.
Excuse me.
Uh, the young men,...
..the ones that came to tell us about Karen...
..they were dressed just like you.
Oh, I see.
Major Teegarden,...
..her commanding officer, he came, too, when he came back from the Gulf.
Brought this photo back for Anne Marie.
Meant a lot to us...
..him coming to see us,...
..telling us in person how Karen died.
I lost men over there, too.
I spoke to the major.
Everybody thought the world of your daughter. So did Specialist llario.
It would sure help if I could see her letter.
I mean, if it's not too private.
Letter?
From llario?
I’ll check my notes. Must be my mistake.
This her husband here?
No. That's Karen's older brother Billy.
Her husband's up in Michigan.
He and Karen divorced after only a year or so.
He never... well,... it was no picnic.
Karen raised Anne Marie on her own.
We'd have been thrilled to have
Anne Marie with us all the time,...
..what with the Army and all.
But Karen was a real good mom.
Never asked for help unless she really needed it.
You can't imagine how hard it was for her...
..to go off and leave that Little girl to fight in a war,...
..but it was important to Karen to do her duty.
So she went.
You've been out here 20 minutes since I spotted you.
- How much longer before that?
I see you, uh...
..got the new refrigerator.
Do you think the kids will understand why their daddy is out here in a Chevy...
..instead of playing with them in the front yard?
Or at Fort Hood, like you told me you were?
Are you back?
I'm in transit.
You know, Nat, it took me a long time...
..to figure out how to be an Army wife without obliterating myself.
It wasn't easy, but I did it.
I know you did, Mer.
So it wouldn't be a hardship for me...
..to learn how not to be an Army wife...
..if my husband wasn't in the Army any more.
The Army's my life, Mer.
And so are we.
You don't have to figure it all out, Nat.
You just have to admit that you can't.
You have to want to be here with us,...
..that's all.
We’ll be here.
For a while.
Now go away.
If you're not going to stay,
I don't want the kids to see you.
This M-16, did it run out of ammo?
[Woman] Yes, sir?
- Colonel Serling, you can go in now.
- I don',t remember...
Hey, Nat, what's up?
General.
It's the Walden file, sir.
One or two discrepancies.
Discrepancies?
Yes, sir.
I knew those White House clowns were up to something.
If she doesn't deserve it, she won't get it.
It's not Captain Walden, sir.
It's some of the details of the stories
I'm getting from her crew.
- I don't know how significant...
- I'm drowning in paper here.
They're crawling all over my ass for combat assessments,...
Sir, I just wanted to let you know this is not a rubber-stamp situation, that's all.
Now, this specialist, uh, llario, there's something funny about his story.
We're not giving the medal to llario.
We're giving it to Walden.
Roger.
Splendid. Move forward.
OK. The discrepancies specifically relate to... use of an M-16 rifle...
Come on, Nat! No two eyewitnesses ever agree on every detail.
You know that as well as I do.
When do we get that report?
I want the White House off my back.
A few days, sir.
You agree that this report should be as detailed and accurate as possible?
Which means exactly what, Colonel?
Which means exactly what I said, sir.
Sorry, sir. This is the second copy of Colonel Serling's AI Bathra deposition.
The investigator seemed to have misplaced the last one.
Rise above.
This will all be over soon.
Will there be a public statement of the facts...
..when the investigation is over, sir?
There's been a decision not to release any findings until every case...
..has been thoroughly reviewed.
Well, how long do you imagine that will be, sir?
I mean, next time I see
Lieutenant Boylar's parents, I'd like to tell them the whole truth.
You know how many grieving parents
I had to deal with during Vietnam?
This is not Vietnam.
Lieutenant Boylar's tank was hit by uranium-depleted shells.
We're the only country in the world that uses them.
We got reporters from the Washington Post looking for the truth,...
..and the only person that knows it can't say it...
..because these investigators are dragging their backsides!
Someone has got to be accountable for this,... sir.
Take a seat.
Nat, I'm going to give you all the rope in the world.
First you imply I'm not interested...
..in an accurate report on Captain Walden.
Now you're suggesting there must be some cover-up going on about AI Bathra.
So how do you want me to respond?
As your commanding officer,...
..or as your friend who nursed you, pushed promotions,...
..and fucking burped your kids at their baptisms?
Just how should I respond?
I'm sorry, sir.
I should hope by God you would be.
Now,...
..losing a man like your friend Boylar,...
..I've been there.
Well, this...
..whole mess...
It's my ass on the line right there beside yours.
I can feel the chilling the air as well as you can.
Yes, sir.
And I know about the drinking.
And if I have to write you up,...
..it’ll just be one more bite out of your record.
Clean it up.
Get yourself in a programme.
I’ll be looking for that report.
Soon.
[Nat] Yes, this is the Serling residence.
[Mer] We’re nothing right now...
- But at the tone, leave a message and...
- [Kids] We’ll call you when we get home.
You better get your head into this!
I'm going to drop you from this programme like a hot rock!
You better hurry up!
Morning, sir. Monfriez is over there.
I’ll get him for you.
Thank you.
What the fuck are you doing, soldier?
Where are your men?
- There, sir.
- Yeah? What do you call that?
You see that man?
You and he are brothers.
He depends on you. You depend on him.
You never leave a man behind.
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Now get the fuck out of here.
[Nat] You were in Panama?
Yes, sir.
Were you there, sir?
Yes, I was.
And you were also in Desert Storm?
Roger that, sir.
How'd you come to be on Captain Walden's chopper?
I used to hang around the medivac unit.
Wanted to be a medic?
Wanted to hump a nurse once.
That count, sir?
See, I play poker.
Those medivac folks, between missions, had a lot of time on their hands.
Want to know a poker secret, sir?
Always.
The people you play against, find out what they're interested in.
Pretend you're interested.
They start running off at the mouth, don't pay attention to their cards.
Medevac folks, they Love to talk about their choppers.
Paid for this baby.
So, talk to me about, um,...
..25 February.
25 February? Yes, sir.
I had some phys rehab time.
Got into boxing.
Want a soda pop?
No, sir. No, I'm good.
25 February.
So, 25 February...
Major, uh, what's his butt?
Garden party...
Teegarden. Major Teegarden.
Right. Asked me to go with Walden, said she might need guns,...
..so I said, you know, OK, why not?
Grabbed me a saw, bungeed one of the Huey doorways and away we went.
Yeah.
And, uh...
..the captain was a big hero...
She died tragically in the desert, and Major...
- Teegarden.
- Teegarden...
..wants her to get the Medal of Honour, so she’ll get it.
When did the M-16 ammo run out?
What?
M-16 ammo?
Blackhawk crew said they heard M-16 fire during the rescue.
When did it run out?
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
You wouldn't?
As... as I recall, and, uh...
..I'm not really sure,...
..but the M-16 ammo ran out first thing in the morning.
First thing in the morning.
But you're not really sure?
Now I'm confused.
- You were there, weren't you?
- Affirmative, sir.
But I was on the saw.
AItameyer would know, sir.
AItameyer?
- Yes, sir. He was manning the M-16.
- Oh, I see. OK.
OK, let's back up, then.
Um,...
..when that tank fired on your chopper,...
..you said that, uh...
..''You should go for altitude and call for support'', right?
Sir?
You knew this wasn't Panama.
Men were going to die, so you wanted to get out, right?
Wh... who told you that, sir?
Tea Party? llario?
It doesn't matter who told me that.
You tell me.
You don't want to know what happened out there, sir.
Yes, I do.
You just want me to sign off on the story...
..so you can finish your job and the lady can get her medal.
Are you refusing to tell me?
Colonel, you know what to do if you get a hang fire...
..when you pull the trigger and the round doesn't go off?
You wait, with your weapon pointed in a safe direction, cos the primer burns slow.
You open your weapon and take the round out,...
..it blows up in your face.
Leave this round in the chamber, Colonel.
I work at the Pentagon, Sergeant,...
..so I admit I'm a Little slow on the uptake.
Otherwise I'd say you just threatened me.
Did you just threaten me, soldier?
Because, if you did, let me respond to you.
Let me respond to you this way.
I'm an officer, and therefore, by proclamation, a gentleman,...
..but don't abuse that, son.
Don't get in my cross hairs, because I’ll have no compunction...
..about getting up to my neck in your ass, understand?
She was afraid, Colonel.
That's the bottom line on Captain Walden.
She was a fucking coward, sir.
Get me around so I can fire!
- Go back. Let me have another shot!
- I don't know.
I'm going for altitude, call for support.
There's no time!
All right, one more!
But then I'm calling for support.
Unhook the aux fuel cells!
Prepare to toss them overboard. llario, get me the flare gun.
So it was your idea to use the fuel cell?
Yeah.
Me, Rady, somebody.
Adrenaline was pumping. You can't expect me to remember everything.
Try.
Now!
- Yay!
- Whoo!
So what happened during the night?
Walden and llario,...
..they wouldn't shut up about being rescued.
Like the Army had nothing else to do.
Dust is blowing hard out there.
- Think they’ll find us tonight?
- AWACS lost us when the ADT got hit.
SOP is for search and rescue to begin looking...
Christ, Captain, are you crying?
It's OK. It's just tension.
Hey, you're going to be OK, OK?
They’ll find us. It’ll be OK.
I can hear the rag heads moving, as soon as you girls stop gabbing.
They're going away.
It was just a probe.
- Shit!
- I'm OK.
- [Monfriez] I took one.
- How's Rady?
Hanging in. Captain?
Ah! Oh!
So the rest of the night went without incident?
Yeah.
Wasn't that enough for one night?
You want to continue this tomorrow?
I don't get emotional about this shit.
I've been there, you know?
OK. Go on.
Well, after the firefight, we argued mainly. llario was freaked out by the dark, and
Walden wanted to surrender at first light.
She was a wreck, kept asking about the ammo, worrying we didn't have enough.
I knew they'd attack at dawn.
So what happened during the evacuation?
Evacuation.
All right, let's go.
There's the rescue.
AItameyer, give me a hand with Rady.
- Come on, Captain!
- Ow!
Come on!
- No! Don't move me!
- Get away!
Suck it up!
I got you covered! Ready?
Go! Go! Go!
- llario, move!
- Not without the Captain!
I’ll get her.
No! I'm not leaving!
I'm not leaving! It's not safe!
They're taking fire!
The choppers are waiting!
No! No! No!
Get the fuck outta here!
Come on!
She fired at you?
Near us, yeah.
Then why did you lie to the investigators about how she performed?
They'd already put together their own bullshit version of the story...
..before they talked to me. I told them what they wanted to hear. We all did.
But that's the truth, so forget about the medal, or leave it as it is.
I don't give a fuck.
So nobody from your Huey crew fired an M-16 any time during the rescue?
That's affirmed, sir.
Monfriez, you ready?
You sure about that?
That's affirmative, sir.
We had no ammo.
So how about it, Colonel?
Want to go a few rounds?
Are you threatening me, soldier?
- Where's your brain bucket?
- I don't need it.
Don't step in here without one.
I have to tell you again, you won't have a head to stick it on.
Come on, Jersey. Right here.
Let's see what you got.
You got nothing, man.
Come on!
- [Meredith] Hello.
- Hello? Baby?
How're you doing?
Hi.
How's it going?
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
I was calling, I wondered...
What... what kind of...
What size T-shirts the kids wear?
I want to get the kids some T-shirts.
You know their sizes as well as I do.
Are you OK?
Nat?
I got a pint of, um...
..Scotch here in a paper bag.
I don't want to drink any of it.
Can you tell me why you need it?
Want me to prattle on for a minute?
I can do that.
[Nat] Please.
OK. Um...
The new refrigerator doesn't work.
The light doesn't come on when you open the door.
I had to drive all the way over to Wagner, 12 blocks,...
..just so that Brian could practice riding his bike.
He's afraid of falling in front of his friends.
He refuses to let anyone see him riding with training wheels.
They've both taken to sleeping in our bed since you left.
It's like sleeping between two tornadoes.
I better go, baby.
Don Boylar called.
Jesus.
I better go.
- Nat, talk to me.
- I can't.
- Why not?
- I can't!
Bullshit. Bull! Talk to me!
Oh, Christ.
Colonel?
Colonel?
Can we get some coffee, please?
You're not a happy man.
A woman? The Army?
AI Bathra?
Talk to me.
Off the record, if you want.
Way, way off the record.
Rangers' honour.
Serling,...
How long you been back?
Six months.
And you... you've been in the service how long?
17 years.
Ah, they got me running this inquiry...
..on this girl pilot.
Captain Karen Walden.
She’ll be the first woman to get the Medal of Honour for combat.
Oh, boy.
And everybody in the beltway wants a piece of this one, right?
I just want to get something clear.
This time, just want somebody to be a hero.
I want to get something right.
Yeah.
Cos AI Bathra, you know...
AI Bathra.
You talked to Boylar's parents?
Yeah.
Do they know?
They heard from a few of his friends.
Aw, Jesus...
You know...
They told Boylar's parents he died from enemy fire.
I told them that.
I carried the message, went to the funeral,...
..watched his mother cry her eyes out.
I stood there and looked his father in the eye...
..and told him his son died brave under fire.
And I was the one who gave the order to fire.
I did it.
Then the Army gave me a medal...
..for bravery and valor.
Then they buried me...
..in medals.
Got a sense of humour, don't they?
Yeah.
Can't remember anything else except being in the Army.
Either being in it or wanting to be in it.
It's all I know.
Look, you need to sleep.
You call me any time.
Anything you want to say about anything, on or off the record.
I'm going to leave you alone for a while. llario. Are you saying you can't find him, or that he's absent without leave?
[Man] Sir, that’s an I... I...
That's right, specialist llario.
Well, we contacted the MPs, sir...
Roger.
Roger that.
Thank you.
Did she display fear when she had to make these life-and-death decisions?
[llario] No, never.
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.
The heavier the pressure, the calmer she got.
And she... you know, she put up with a lot of shit to become an officer.
Had to work twice as hard as everybody else, be twice as good.
She’d never let the guard down, show any sign of weakness.
But she was tough. She could handle it.
So, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say to you in closing...
..is to go forth,...
..to command wisely,...
..to advise prudently,...
..to protect with vigilance...
..and to judge with care.
And above all,...
..to defend with all your heart, all your soul...
..and all your courage...
..the lives of the men and women under your command,...
..and the United States of America.
Are you now saying you’ll report against her getting the medal?
As I explained to the White House, there should be a further investigation...
..before we move forward.
The discrepancies...
Another matter completely.
Write up a second report.
That's my point, sir! llario's disappeared. Altameyer's missing.
- Who?
- AItameyer, sir. Walden's crew chief.
VA hospital's transferred him out three weeks ago.
Paperwork's missing.
Doesn't he have any family?
Negative.
Fucking VA. We can't wait, Nat.
You cannot imagine the kind of heat I'm getting on this.
Everybody wants it.
Senators, congressmen, one shiny piece of something for people to believe in.
Whole episode.
Walden or AI Bathra?
Both, damn it, both.
Submit your report today.
I'm sorry, sir.
I won't put my name on an incomplete report.
May I remind you who recommended you for this when no-one else touch you?
You saying you chose me because I wouldn't rock the boat?
Dereliction of duty, drunk and disorderly, conduct unbecoming.
At best, a dishonorable discharge.
At worst, AI Bathra gives us plenty of grounds, if we want 'em.
At least somebody has finally said it.
Nat, don't do this. I could give you a direct order to submit your report.
Yes, you could.
Put Hillerman back on the Walden file!
I handed this to you, Nat, as a way back.
You could've had one hell of a career.
And you give Meredith my best.
Tell her I didn't have any choice.
I'm going to finish this report.
On my own, if I have to.
I'm going to get this one right.
You want one?
No, thank you.
Why is it people never want to eat when they got something important to say?
I always want to eat.
Need you to help me find somebody.
You want my help?
Yeah.
Name's AItameyer. Steven AItameyer.
He was the crew chief on the medevac chopper, piloted by Karen Walden.
- One supposed to get a Medal of Honour?
- The very one.
The Army's usually tidy about its people.
Yeah, usually, but not this time.
First he demobbed, then they had him in a VA hospital.
They transferred him.
Now no-one can find him.
Why do you need me?
Can't someone in the Pentagon help?
I'm out of the loop.
Somebody pissed at you?
- I'm out of the loop.
- Somebody important?
- You want to help me or not?
- Hey, who called who here?
Yeah, sure, I’ll help.
Just tell me why I'm doing it.
When you go after stories, you want them to be right, yes?
Yeah.
So do I.
OK.
So, I help you find this AItameyer,...
..and in return...?
There's a tape.
Sweet Jesus. There's always a tape.
- D'you want to hear this?
- Yeah.
Yeah, go on.
There's a tape of all communications between our tanks that night in AI Bathra.
Are they trying to make it disappear?
I don't think so, but they're not advertising its existence, either.
The Army and its image.
Where do I reach you when I find this AItameyer?
The Bethesda Arms.
A motel?
- Bet everything's great in your life.
- Outstanding.
Serling,...
..eat something.
You look awful.
[Karen] # Make me an angel
# Flies from Montgomery
# Make me a poster
# From an old rodeo
# Just give me one thing
# That I can hold on to
# To believe in this living’
# It's just a...
# Hard way to go
# To believe in this living’
# It's just a...
# Hard way
# To go
Hello.
[Gartner] Found Altameyer.
Got any complaints?
Excuse me?
Rashes, fatigue, bleeding gums,...
..muscle and joint pain, loss of weight, loss of appetite,...
..insomnia, reactions to bright sunlight.
You name it, we're seeing it.
I drink too much. Does that count?
Hell, we all drink too much.
Here he is.
AItameyer, you want a shave?
Gentleman here to see you.
You want a shave?
What's wrong with him?
Abdominal cancer.
That's what's killing him.
There's many things wrong with him.
He's never awake very long with all the pain.
I’ll leave you two, then.
Thank you.
How you doing, Steven?
I'm Colonel Serling.
Nat Serling.
I want to talk to you about Captain Karen Walden.
They want to give her the Medal of Honour,...
..and I know that you were there in AI Kufan with her.
Roger?
I was...
..hit.
In the back.
Roger.
But you were still able to get Rady out.
Rady.
Yeah.
Good man Rady.
I was...
..afraid.
I understand, son.
That's OK. Take your time.
She was afraid.
She... she was afraid.
The Captain was afraid?
Not...
..the Captain.
Who then? Was it Rady or llario?
Was llario afraid?
Me.
Did... didn't tell.
You didn't tell what, son?
The major.
Monfriez.
You didn't tell the major Monfriez...
You... you and Monfriez didn't tell the major?
He...
..and then they...
You and Monfriez didn't tell the major.
You and Monfriez what, Steven?
Oh, Jesus.
What? What is it?
Tell me son, please. What is it?
Jesus.
What? What?
The fire.
- What? What fire?
- Oh, Jesus, the fire.
What fire?
The napalm fire?
Jesus.
- You see the napalm fire.
- Jesus.
Tell me about the fire.
You and Monfriez didn't tell the major what about the fire?
- Please, Jesus.
- Steven!
Jesus, please.
Is it napalm fire? Steven?
Please, Jesus.
Jesus, please.
Steven.
Jesus.
Please.
Jesus.
What's he doing?
He's upping his meds. Self-medication.
Well, can you get him to stop?
I mean, I need to talk to him.
Give him a break.
He's feeling no pain now.
Left.
Left.
Left.
Left.
Get off my car, sir.
Think you got something to tell me, Sergeant.
I called around.
You're off this inquiry, so why you here?
Karen Walden sent me.
I just left AItameyer.
What happened out there that was so bad...
..that it would have AItameyer laying up in a hospital praying to die,...
..that's got llario on the run?
That's right, he went AWOL.
What do you think he’ll tell them about you when they catch him?
And they're going to catch him, son.
Now, you can tell them,...
..or you can tell me.
What happened out there?
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened, sir.
It was a war.
Don't lie to me, soldier.
Don't lie to me.
It doesn't matter whether she gets this award or not.
It doesn't matter whether I'm on this inquiry or whether I'm in this Army.
I'm going to find out the truth.
I guarantee you that.
You said you were a good poker player.
Well, look me in the eye.
You think I'm bluffing?
No, thank you.
You want it.
I can smell how much you want it.
It's coming out of your pores.
Tell me about the fire.
I like trains.
Since I was a kid.
Big...
Tough...
Iron.
Used to be iron, anyway.
When I got to boxing pro, I was going to call myself Johnny ''Night
Train'' Monfriez.
- Don't that have a nice ring to it?
- Very nice.
Don't humour me, man.
Say it like you mean it.
Don't humour me, either.
Tell me about the fire.
Where's my other bottle?
You ever kill anyone at close range with a small arm, sir?
It's messy.
No.
We're not talking...
..one of your great big tank guns here.
Oh, that's OK.
I know what you did.
Your own men.
Guys under your command.
How'd it feel?
Bad, right?
Very bad, son.
Very bad.
And you didn't even mean to kill them.
I've been a good soldier.
A good soldier.
Listen to that whistle.
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.
Say it.
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.
Now get out.
You don't want to do this, son.
Let me help you.
- It's too late.
- It's never too late. Look at me.
Things get fucked up in war.
I don't care what happened to you.
You can't do this.
Wrong!
I can't do anything else.
Yes, you can. You can put the car in reverse. Put the gun down.
We can help each other.
I don't want to lose another good soldier.
I strongly urge you...
..to dismount the vehicle, sir.
Monfriez. Monfriez!
Aah!
[llario] imagine that. imagine not thinking about the consequences. it’s not the doing shit that gets to you, it’s the consequences.
My folks used to have this place out on Calaveras Lake.
I still go there sometimes.
Guess you told me about this place so I'd know where to find you.
It's beautiful.
The MPs at Fort Stewart...
..found your stash in your locker.
Pretty ingenious place to keep it, huh?
Not if you wanted it to be found.
Where'd you hide the needle tracks?
I, uh...
I shoot up between my toes.
Monfriez is dead.
Killed himself.
AItameyer is dying.
Aren't we all?
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!
We're going down! Mayday!
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!
We're going down!
We're going down!
And the chopper went down?
What happened next?
What happened next isn't important.
It's what happened that night.
Monfriez wanted to make a run for it.
At dawn we're dead.
They’ll have reinforcements.
Escape and evasion, Captain.
Now's the time to do it.
Maybe we'd slip by them in the dark.
I told you,...
..Rady can't be moved.
Right, llario?
That lung - any movement may kill him.
But he may die lying here.
You see?
Rady will never make it. I say we go.
Oh, great.
Great. The Captain's crying.
It's just tension, asshole.
It doesn't mean shit.
Come on, Captain.
I don't want to wait here to die. llario?
- I don't know.
- Come on, it's a majority.
That'd be great if this was a democracy, but it isn't.
We stay with Rady.
I wouldn't risk your life.
I won't risk his.
So if we surrender, the Iraqis would doctor him up.
No surrender.
I hear something moving.
- I say we make for the chopper now.
- And I say I heard enough of that shit.
You don't have to go.
We don't need your permission.
I am in command here!
Well, maybe not any more.
Give me the saw, Monfriez.
I can't stop you from running, but you're not taking our fire power with you.
You're not taking away my weapon.
Yes, I am.
Hey, I can make a white flag, all right?
There's no way you're taking away my weapon, cunt.
Section 28-J,...
..code of military justice.
Mutiny,...
..an offence punishable by death.
Jesus, Monfriez.
Shut up! She's trying to get us killed! llario, who you with?
Come on, llario, shithead, do you want to die?
Please, Captain.
Oh!
Unh.
They're going away.
It was just a probe.
Oh.
Shit.
[Altameyer] Are you all right?
[Walden] Shit!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Shit.
I don't fucking believe it.
Give me your weapon.
Christ, I thought you were firing at me!
You're wounded, ma'am. Let me see.
You're with him.
You got to let me look at it.
Christ, let him look at it!
I gave birth to a nine-pound baby,...
..asshole!
I think I can handle it!
Cap, we got to get you out of here.
We stay with Rady.
- And then?
- And then...
[Altameyer] Incoming!
150 metres and closing!
[Altameyer] 140!
[Altameyer] 130!
Give me my weapon! llario, how's Rady?
- He's dead!
- No, he's alive!
Come on, Captain, give him his weapon!
- This is insane! Give me my weapon!
- Shut up!
90 metres and closing!
I'm sorry.
OK. OK.
OK, we’ll get you out of here, Captain.
It's all over.
No, Monfriez,...
..it's not over.
There will be a reckoning.
Count on it.
Hey, what's that?
There's the rescue!
Let's move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!
No!
Wait.
Help Rady.
We're pinned down here! llario, give me the M-16.
Give me the goddamn M-16!
I’ll cover you.
Go!
I’ll cover you!
Negative, ma'am!
Come back for me with a stretcher and more guns!
- Karen, please!
- Go! It's an order!
Karen, please!
Go! Go!
Wait!
Wait!
Where's Walden?
She's dead!
No!
Monfriez said she would have court-martial led us.
AItameyer was too fucked up to say anything.
She was...
She was probably killed by small arms...
..before the napalm ever hit.
Either way,...
..she never could have survived that stomach wound.
You think that matters?
No.
No.
Hmm.
I couldn't bear to send this.
Uh, I didn't even want to...
I didn't even want to touch it.
Uh...
Can you get it to her parents for me?
Can you...?
Please?
Yeah.
Uh, listen,
I'm going to have to call you back.
You got off the phone for me?
- You’ll want me there for this.
- Meaning?
Remember that stereo you told me not to buy cos who needs a dual cassette deck?
When does anyone ever have a reason to copy a tape?
Nat, just the man I wanted to see.
Uh, do you know Colonel Serling?
This is Tony Gartner of the Washington Post.
He was with the 9th in Vietnam.
Mr. Gartner.
Colonel.
Take a seat, Nat.
He's following up our investigation of AI Bathra,...
..and it seems that he has a few questions that he'd like to ask us.
Let's give him every facility.
- I appreciate that.
- Some ground rules, though.
I insist we be allowed to schedule the release of all information...
..to the public regarding casualties.
Well, I wish I could accommodate you, sir,...
..but, unfortunately, we’ll be going with a story based on a tape that I've acquired...
..of all radio communications that night.
So,...
..I'd like you to listen...
..and then comment for the record.
I can't comment for the record.
This is an ongoing investigation.
[Serling] First right! Turn to the right!
Sabre-6, this is Bobcat-5.
Enemy tangos!
Say again! Enemy tanks in our lines. Over.
[Boylar] Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
Enemy tangos at phase line delta...
- I don't think any more of this...
- This is what happened, General.
[Serling] Liberty-6, this is Sabre-6.
Enemy tanks on our flank. Out!
Patella, find me a target.
- I think I got one, sir.
- Do you or do you not have a target?
It must be, sir. They’re firing at us.
Loader!
Up, sir!
Fire!
On the way!
- Target! We got that sucker!
- Yeah!
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.
Repeat, we just lost Boylar.
Roger that, sir. We got him.
- You just lit up a friendly.
- Roger that. We... What?
You just lit up a friendly, goddamn it!
Cougar-6 was one of your own Abrams,
Colonel Serling. Is that correct?
Yes, that's correct.
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening?
Sabre-6, report.
[Serling] Patella, was that one of our tanks?
They fired.
At us or at the T-72s?
I don',t know.
- At us or at the T-72s, Patella?
- I don’t know!
Colonel Serling, report status now.
They have range on us!
All Sabre elements, stop all tanks, turn on your lights.
I say again, stop all tanks and turn on your Lights.
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening out there?
Load us up.
Patella, find me a target.
Snap out of it. Find me a target.
Patella, come on!
- Target!
- We're up.
- Lights on or off?
- Off.
- Fire!
- On the way.
- Sir?
- Fire!
Colonel Serling, report status now!
Sabre-6, situation under control, General.
General, Colonel Serling's order to activate Lights,...
..was that a standard response to enemy infiltration of the lines?
At the critical moment,...
..in spite of terrible losses,...
..Colonel Serling didn't hesitate to act.
Ordering those tanks to turn on their Lights...
..saved the lives of God knows how many of our men.
Heroic acts arise...
..out of desperate circumstances.
I have no trouble at all believing that Colonel Serling is a hero.
Like Captain Karen Walden.
Did you know, Mr. Gartner, for the first time a woman is being considered...
..for the Medal of Honour for her performance under fire?
And, um,...
..Colonel Serling...
..is just finishing up the inquiry.
How's that going, Nat?
I think, uh,...
..in order to honour a soldier like Karen Walden,...
..we have to tell the truth, General,...
..about what happened over there.
The whole, hard,...
..cold truth.
And until we do that, uh,...
..we dishonor her...
..and every soldier who died,...
..who gave their life for their country.
My full report, General.
Few of us are given the opportunity,...
..even fewer the courage,...
..to sacrifice ourselves for the lives of our comrades.
In daily life, even as in battle,...
..each one of us is mysteriously and irrevocably bound to our fellow man.
And yet,...
..it is only in death that the power of this bond...
..is finally tested and proven.
And who among us really knows...
..how he might respond when that moment comes?
[Man] I guess we've been expecting you.
Ahem. First of all, let me, um...
Let me just say that, uh,...
..there was nothing that, uh,...
..Tom and I wouldn't do for each other.
Nothing.
He was a good soldier.
He was like a brother to me.
That night, uh, 25 February...
..there were enemy tanks in our lines.
We thought...
I... I thought that, uh,...
..Tom's tank was an enemy tank.
And, uh,...
..I gave the order to fire.
God help me.
I, um...
Yeah, I killed him.
As for the funeral,...
..the lies the Army told...
..and the lies that I told...
..to you, I can only...
..beg for your forgiveness.
As far as the...
As far as that night, um,...
..I guess there's no way that, uh,...
..I can even begin to ask you to forgive me.
I know that,...
..but it's a burden you're going to have to put down sometime.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. President.
[Karen] Dear Mom and Dad,...
..well, this is it - the big push.
Looks like it's gonna really happen.
And I'm afraid,...
..not of being hurt or killed,...
..well, kind of, but not much.
My only regret will be to never see you two again...
..and that I’ll never see Anne Marie grow up.
But I know she's in good hands, the best.
What I'm really afraid of is that
I might let my people down, my crew.
These people depend on me.
They put their lives in my hands.
I just can't fall 'em.
Now, I know if you get this letter...
..it means I'm dead.
I only hope that I've made you proud,...
..that I did my job,...
..and I didn't let down my country,...
..my crew, my fellow soldiers.
I Love you guys.
Never stop telling Anne Marie how much I Love her.
Your daughter, Karen.
You got it? All right.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Two o'clock in Memphis WHBQ.
George TCBing with August Super Tuesday.
The man says H and H, hot and humid all afternoon, now 92.
The heart and soul of rock 'n' roll going for 97.
DIANNE: Ricky! Son!
RICKY: What?
DIANNE:
Come back here.
Won't be back till late.
I want you in by dark.
I want you to watch out for your brother.
RICKY: I can watch out for myself.
MARK: Can not.
Don't worry, Mom, I'll take care of him.
RICKY: How come you always have to watch out for me?
MARK:
Because I'm older, stupid.
RICKY:
Mom, he's calling me stupid.
DIANNE:
Would y'all hush up?
Don't be reading any more of them scary comics.
- You hear me, Ricky?
RICKY: Whatever.
DIANNE:
He can't sleep.
Shoot, I'm gonna miss my bus.
I'm gonna be late again.
I'm gonna get docked for sure.
There's some macaroni and cheese in the cabinet, okay?
All right.
- Got your lunch?
DIANNE: Thank you, baby.
Keys?
DIANNE:
Oh, yeah.
Exact change for the bus?
DIANNE:
Oh, shoot, baby. Thank you.
I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.
- You stay out of them woods.
- Okay, Mom.
DIANNE:
You hear me, Mark?
- Bye, baby.
RICKY: Hmm.
- Come on, Mark, give me a cigarette.
MARK: No way.
RICKY:
Mark, wait.
MARK: Catch me and I'll give you one.
RICKY: I can't run that fast.
[MARK LAUGHS]
MARK:
Catch me.
RICKY:
Wait up, Mark.
MARK:
Better hurry or you'll never get your smoke.
RICKY:
We're not supposed to go in the woods.
MARK:
Go home, I'll smoke them myself.
Come get me.
- Come on.
RICKY: Wait up, Mark.
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
Come on, Ricky. Catch me.
RICKY:
Come on, give me one.
MARK:
No way, pal.
RICKY:
I'll tell Mom.
MARK:
Tattletale.
- You know the deal.
RICKY: Yeah. If I tell anyone, you'll kick my ass.
MARK: That's right. And if I catch you smoking more than one a day--
RICKY: I know, you'll kick my ass again.
MARK: That's right.
RICKY: How many do you smoke a day?
MARK: Only one. I'm smart, heh.
RICKY: Will one a day kill me?
MARK: Nah!
Not any time soon, but more than that and you could be in deep shit.
RICKY: How many does Mom smoke?
MARK: Forty.
RICKY:
Whoa.
- And what about Dad?
MARK: A hundred a day.
RICKY:
Oh, he's gonna die soon, huh?
Heh, I wish. Sit there.
Don't try to swallow the smoke yet, because I know you're not ready for that.
You'll just choke and puke all over the place.
Suck a little and blow.
[COUGHS]
[LAUGHS]
Told you not to swallow the smoke.
This is easy.
Yeah, that's why you look like you're gonna puke.
Do not.
[WHISPERS]
Where's he going?
Shh.
RICKY:
What's he doing?
Shh.
[MAN SIGHS]
MAN:
Damn, damn. Heh.
Damn.
[MAN GROANS]
[GRUNTS]
Damn. Goddamn it.
[TRUNK CLOSES]
Son of a bitch.
Jesus Christ, he's trying to kill himself.
How do you know?
MARK:
I seen it on TV once.
- Why do you think he wants to kill himself?
- How am I supposed to know, stupid?
- Well, let's get the hell out of here.
- No.
You stay here. Okay?
If you move, I'll kick your ass.
What are you gonna do?
[WHISPERS]
Mark.
Mark.
[SIGHS]
[PANTING]
- Come on, let's go.
- No. We gotta make sure he's okay.
- Think he's dead?
- Don't know.
[MAN SIGHS]
[CAR DOOR OPENS]
MAN:
Damn.
Nothing works. Nothing works.
He is crazy as hell.
[MAN GROANS]
Damn it. Damn.
- Let's go, please. Come on.
- No, we can't.
If he kills himself and we know anything about it, we can be in all kinds of bullshit.
We won't tell no one.
- Just let him die.
- We're not leaving till I say we're leaving.
- Stay down, Mark.
- Stay here.
Mark.
[WHIMPERING]
Let him die.
[MARK GASPS]
You bastard.
[BOTH GRUNT]
You bastard!
Come on.
- Get in there. Get in there.
- No.
Get in there.
[MAN YELLS]
[PANTING]
I said get--
Don't you touch that damn door!
Sorry, kid.
You had to be a cute ass.
Had to stick your dirty little nose in my business, didn't you?
So I think we should die together.
Just you and me, pal. Off to la-la land.
[GASPS]
Sweet dreams.
- You want that gun?
- No, sir.
- Why you looking at it?
- I wasn't, sir.
Don't you lie to me!
I'm crazy. If you lie to me, I'll kill you.
Please don't kill me, sir.
I got my mother and my little brother to take care of.
I'll give you a choice.
I can blow your brains out. ..
...and end it now...
...or we could wait and let the gas do it.
You decide.
[MAN CACKLES]
[CRYING]
What's your name?
Mark. Mark Sway.
- Aah!
- Jerome Clifford.
Attorney at law, heh.
So since we're both pretty tight right now...
...you can call me Romey.
Shh.
Listen. Hear that bird?
I drove all the way from New Orleans to hear those stupid birds. Grew up here.
I played in these woods.
Now I'm gonna die here too.
Why are you doing this?
Because if I don't kill myself, he will.
- Who's he?
- The Blade.
Barry "The Blade" Muldano.
[CHUCKLES]
Why does this Blade guy wanna kill you?
[LAUGHS]
Because I know....
I know where the proverbial body is buried.
Whose body?
See, my client killed
Senator Boyd Boyette...
...and hid the body.
So now my client, he wants to kill me.
You know where the body's buried?
The body's buried.. ..
He hid the body.. ..
He's still buried there, can you believe it? Ha, ha.
They haven't found it yet.
FBI's dug up half of New Orleans.
They haven't found it, they're not gonna find it, no way.
Yeah. Oh, yeah, Mark, go for it, ha, ha.
Yeah, Mark, go ahead.
Go ahead, Mark, pull the trigger.
Yeah. Pull the trigger.
Pull the goddamn trigger! Pull it!
Pull the trigger!
Pull it!
Pretty nifty piece, huh? Ha, ha. Oh, heh.
Hell, I don't even know if it works.
[PANTING]
Let's see if it works.
[SCREAMS]
It works! Ha, ha.
- Shit.
- It works. Hey, get over here!
- Ricky.
CLIFFORD: I told you not to go anywhere!
Ricky, damn you, come on.
Hey, Mark! Son of a bitch.
[GROANS]
Hey!
Where are you?
Goddamn kid!
Hey!
Mark!
Come back here, kid!
If the Blade finds out what I told you, he's gonna kill you anyway.
- Shh, shh!
- You hear me, kid?
Mark, where are you?
[GUN COCKS]
[GUNSHOT]
[RICKY SCREAMING]
[PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
- Put my drink on my bill, babe.
WOMAN: All right.
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS]
Come on, boys, dance with me.
I've been waiting a half hour.
Where the hell's Romey?
- Damn feds are on my ass.
- God, Mr. Muldano.
I don't know.
He hasn't been in here all day.
- Now, Claudette, God hates a liar.
- Heh.
That's what my mother always said.
Heh, I'm not lying, honest to God,
I haven't seen him.
I don't know where he is.
You know, Claudette...
...you're a very pretty woman.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, thank you, Mr. Muldano.
You wanna stay pretty, don't you?
Oh, please.
I'm just a secretary.
Listen, honest to God,
I don't know where he is.
He doesn't always tell me where he's going--
Put your hand in there.
Put your hand in here!
I don't-- I don't know. Honest to--
Shh.
Put your hand in. Come on, put it in.
Please. I don't know where he is.
Come on.
[MULDANO GRUNTS
AND CLAUDETTE SCREAMS]
[CLAUDETTE WEEPS]
Mr. Muldano.
You know, Claudette, I believe you really didn't know where he was.
OFFICER 1: Lift.
OFFICER 2: Get another sample here.
OFFICER 3:
Damn.
OFFICER 4:
What's inside here?
OFFICER 5: Is this something here?
- Check the hood.
OFFICER 6:
Take a look at this.
- There you go.
- Watch yourself.
Bring it on through here.
What's up, kid?
What are you so scared of, huh?
Did you have a bad dream?
You're scaring your mama.
Get your thumb out of your--
[WHISPERS]
Come on, baby. Talk to your mama.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Where have you been?
What the hell is wrong with your brother?
[DISPATCHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
OVER RADIO]
What have you done now?
What the hell is going on?
- Boy witnessed a suicide, ma'am.
- He what?
Oh, well, me and Ricky was just out in the woods playing. ..
...and we seen this guy and he was dead and he had a gun in his mouth.
Oh, my dear God.
And I ran home and called 911.
What happened to Ricky?
He just laid on the bed and started sucking his thumb and wouldn't talk.
This is Sergeant Hardy. We need the paramedics over here at Sway's trailer now.
This boy needs to be hospitalized.
I don't have health insurance.
That's okay,
St. Peter's will take indigent cases.
- Pack some things for the hospital tonight.
DIANNE: What, like clothes? What?
[SIREN WAILING]
You telling the truth, son?
About what you all saw.
Don't you believe me?
I didn't say I didn't believe you.
Just seems strange, that's all.
You called 911, but you wouldn't leave your name.
Well, I was scared.
It was the first dead guy I ever saw.
Why'd you sneak back and hide up in the woods where I found you?
I don't know.
I just wanted to see, I guess.
HARDY:
Hmm.
Did you talk to the man before he killed himself?
No, I never talked to him.
Name "Jerome Clifford" mean anything to you?
No.
You know, I found some fresh cigarette butts near the body.
Same brand as your mama smokes.
Somehow I can't see you finding the body and then deciding to have a cigarette.
[SIGHS]
Look, officer, all that happened was we was just walking through the woods...
...when we found Romey dead. That's all.
- Who's Romey?
- That's the guy's name, isn't it?
I said, Jerome Clifford.
Whoever heard of the name Romey?
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
GREENWAY:
I'm Dr. Greenway. Is this your son?
DIANNE:
Yeah, he's my son.
GREENWAY: What's his name?
DIANNE: Ricky Sway.
GREENWAY: How long has he been this way?
- I didn't find him, my other boy, Mark, did.
You found him, Mark? Ricky?
Is that what you called him? Ricky?
REPORTER 1 [ON TV]: Jerome R. Clifford,
New Orleans attorney, was found dead...
...in an apparent suicide outside Memphis just hours ago.
The famed Mafia lawyer was due to defend the alleged Mafia hit man...
...Barry "The Blade" Muldano next month...
...in the increasingly notorious case of still-missing Louisiana senator...
...Boyd Boyette, now presumed dead.
REPORTER 2:
It was going to be tough...
...to build a case against Muldano without a body...
...but surely Clifford's death will mean more delays.
As one informed source tells me...
...the plot thickens and sickens for U.S. Attorney Roy Foltrigg.
REPORTER 3:
No body, no case, no conviction.
And that means no front-page pictures that Attorney Foltrigg likes so much.
REPORTER 3: No CNN interviews, no speedy ascent to Capitol Hill.
Sorry, Reverend Roy.
- I never liked that old cow.
DRIVER: We're here, Roy.
He tried it first with a garden hose attached to the tailpipe, but it didn't work.
He was probably too stoned.
He was full of downers and about a gallon of whiskey.
Guess he figured he'd swallow a bullet for dessert. Single gunshot to the head.
- Cheap snub-nosed .38.
- A definite suicide, Roy.
Damn him.
I called Romey two days ago, I said:
"I have enough evidence to pierce client-attorney privilege. ..
...and put your fat ass on the stand."
I was bullshitting him, of course.
I was trying to get him nervous, see if he'd talk.
Didn't know he'd blow his scalp off.
He must've known where that body's at.
MAN 1: Oh, he's never gonna tell us now.
Without that body we got no case.
ROY: How's the weather in Memphis?
MAN 3: It's hot, Roy.
Sprite?
- What happened to your face?
- I got in a fight at school.
It's summer. There's no school.
I meant, a kid from my school.
- Who was the kid?
- Why?
Why? Because I'm a cop.
It's my job to ask questions.
Besides, I think your story's full of holes.
I believe you were in that car before Clifford died.
What does "indigent" mean?
Indigent?
That means "poor."
Like you and your mother and your little brother.
So you better tell the truth...
...hope it snaps him out of it.
Otherwise. ..
...he could lie in some institution for dirt-poor crazy people...
...with padded walls and cockroaches...
...and, uh, chained to some filthy bed with snakes--
Mark. ..
...I'm Karen. Will you come with me?
MARK: Bye.
- Bye.
- We're gonna have to watch him.
DIANNE: What are you gonna do?
GREENWAY: We're just gonna watch for now. Sometimes just a good night's sleep...
...and they wake up, they don't know what's going on.
His reflexes seem to be good.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
Mark, honey, Ricky's real sick.
- What's the matter with him?
- It's called post-traumatic stress syndrome.
Sometimes a person sees something they just can't deal with.
I'm always telling Mark,
"No horror movies. No scary comics."
Not for Ricky.
- He's always been tender that way.
GREENWAY: Easy, now.
DIANNE: You try to protect them, there's just so bad out there.
GREENWAY: Why don't you get some rest yourself? Why don't you lie down and rest?
There's nothing more you can do.
We're just gonna watch him.
You've had a rough day.
Just lie down in here. Stay with him.
BEALE:
Boy, that's a bad injury. What happened?
MAN: Car wreck. Got hit by an oil truck.
Nut run a stop sign.
BEALE: My name's Gill Beale, I'm a lawyer.
You got a problem, I can fix it.
I specialize in car wrecks, especially large trucks.
Let's see what you got. A broken leg, a concussion, a couple of busted ribs--
- And a broken collarbone.
- Great.
I can get you at least 600,000.
We'll file suit tomorrow.
Did I say six? Six is just for starters.
Here, check me out.
Call up Gill Beale, you'll see who's for real.
More lawyers around this place than there are doctors.
Now, don't be that way.
I'm gonna outrun that little buggy of yours.
- Wait till you get a load of this guy.
- All right.
Mr. Foltrigg, Jason McThune, FBI.
Welcome to Memphis, home of the king.
City of the good abode.
ROY:
What do you know, McThune?
Uh, kid's name is Mark Sway. He told Memphis
P.D. that he and his younger brother...
...just stumbled on the body in the woods, and then ran and called the cops.
- I think he's lying.
- Why's that?
We lifted his prints off a Sprite can...
...they match prints that were all over the car, inside and out.
I think he was in that car before Clifford shot himself.
And he was there for a while because of the number of prints.
- Why would the kid lie?
- One, he's scared.
Two, he's a kid, they always lie.
Adults are the enemy.
And three, maybe Romey Clifford told him something he knows he should not know.
People hate to die with secrets.
That's good work, McThune.
Ha, thank you very much, sir.
I'm gonna keep it up, believe me.
Listen, ah, I'm sick and tired of chasing
Elvis sightings.
I wanna get out of here.
Is there any room on your staff?
- Where you wanna go?
- Anywhere you go.
Gotta do something about that hair first, heh.
Yes, sir, ha, ha.
- Meantime, I wanna talk to that child.
- Right away, sir.
Dr. Greenway wants to see you.
MARK:
How old are you?
Twenty-four. Why?
Are you married?
Sometimes.
DIANNE: I don't know nothing, but he looks better to me.
I think if we get him home and get him in his own bed, he's gonna be fine.
I don't know why you just can't. ..
- Mrs. Sway.
- ...give him some medicine or something.
Can't you just give him a shot or something? I gotta go to work.
- Our trailer park takes rent by the week.
- Listen to me.
Right now, it's as if Ricky's in a dark place and he's trying to find the way out.
- Now, what's very important-- Listen to me.
- Ugh.
What's very important is that when he finds that way out...
...the first thing he sees is your face.
Let's hope it'll only take a day or two.
There goes another job. Must be damn near setting some kind of record.
I'll call your employer,
I'm sure he's gonna understand--
My employer runs a sweatshop, doctor.
He will not send flowers.
He will not understand.
You could take shifts.
- Perhaps the father could come in--?
- Ex-father.
And you keep him away from Ricky.
- Now hush.
- Okay, Mom, I'm sorry.
[GREENWAY CLEARS THROAT]
Uh, I don't know if you've seen this...
...but there are policemen downstairs and reporters.
The FBI is coming to interview Mark at 10.
Mom, I don't wanna talk to them.
I'm gonna wind up like Ricky if they don't stop bugging me.
- They're not gonna go away.
- I don't give a flying shit about the FBI.
- You are getting on my last nerve.
- Mrs. Sway--
Would you sit down and hush up?
I don't know what the hell to do.
- Can I see you outside?
- I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Telling me to wait for my boy to--
Some crap.
[SWAY SIGHS]
Mom?
- This boy.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'll think of something to get us out of this, I promise.
Hey. You and Ricky just found that guy dead.
Right?
Come on now, there's nothing you ain't telling me, is there?
Dr. Greenway wants to start you on Valium,
Mrs. Sway.
Those cost extra?
KAREN: Yeah, don't worry about that, just take these here.
- Both of them?
- Both of them.
You're gonna start feeling better.
- Don't go far.
MARK: Okay, Mom.
HARDY:
FBI, huh? Whoo!
You know, I hear that they're sending the Reverend Roy Foltrigg himself.
That's bad. That's.. ..
You know that the FBI...
...puts kids in jail if they break the law?
And if a kid has been involved in a murder...
...they got a special little, uh, kid-sized electric chair.
I saw it once. It was about... so high.
Did you know that when somebody gets electrocuted, the current is so strong. ..
...it makes the blood in the veins boil.
[MAKES CRACKLING SOUND]
God.
Fry you up just like a piece of bacon.
- You're the only pig around here.
- Oh.
See you later, Markus.
[REPORTERS CHATTERING]
REPORTER 1:
Are you here to question Mark Sway?
I beg your pardon?
REPORTER 2:
Are you here in Memphis. ..
...to improve your own position regarding the case, sir?
My real interest is to see justice done.
Every one of you knows that about me.
REPORTER 3:
Are you ever gonna find that body?
ROY: We're gonna locate the senator's body.
You can count on that.
REPORTER 4:
What do you think Mark Sway knows?
You ain't gonna run here by yourself.
- What do you want, boy?
- I need to see Mr. Beale.
- Where are your parents?
- Where are yours?
- Are you even injured?
- Do I look injured?
Well, we only do injuries.
Well, I'll just go get hit by a truck and come back.
[PHONE BUZZES]
You all shut up too.
- Yes?
- Hell, no.
WOMAN: What the hell's wrong with this damn window?
Where you going?
I'm gonna pick up something to eat and then swing by the post office.
WOMAN:
All right.
Hey. When's your boss coming back?
WOMAN:
Ugh, may I help you?
No, I need to see Reggie Love.
WOMAN:
Why, may I ask?
Well, that's between me and Mr. Love.
I'm Reggie Love.
Pssh, a woman lawyer, oh, great.
I think so. Now, why is it you think you want a lawyer?
I don't want a lawyer. I hate lawyers.
Every lawyer I ever had just shafted me and my mom.
I said I need a lawyer.
But I don't know about no woman.
Well, this lawyer that shafted you, what was her name?
It wasn't no her, it was a he.
Right.
Well, why is it that you think you need a lawyer?
- Because I'm Mark Sway.
- So?
You know, the kid who found the dead guy.
I'm famous. Don't you read the paper?
You still haven't answered my question.
Because I'm supposed to talk to some
Reverend Roy guy in 10 minutes.
- Reverend Roy Foltrigg?
- Yeah, why's everybody call him that?
He loves to quote the scriptures in court...
...and knows the Bible better than God himself.
- Does he win a lot?
- Always.
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
Some sweaty fat guy blows his head off--
- Why did you lie to the police?
- I didn't.
Well, it says here in this paper that you found Jerome Clifford dead.
- I did.
- Uh-huh.
Dead men don't sweat, now do they?
If you was my lawyer...
...and I told you something, could you ever repeat it?
No. What is it you wanna tell me?
Well, that Clifford guy came driving up in his big black car...
...and me and Ricky, we snuck up to watch, and that Clifford guy got out...
...and he put a gun in his mouth and he blew the back of his head out.
So you did see Jerome Clifford alive?
- Yeah.
- Why'd you lie to the police?
I don't know.
I mean, I was just scared, I guess.
My little brother's in a coma and my mom might lose her job.
The FBI’s after me but I don't know nothing.
You would lie too.
Well, you're right, you do need a lawyer, Mark Sway.
There are a few male lawyers down the hall.
You want me to recommend one?
- How many cases have you won?
- More than I lost.
- How much do you cost?
- How much you got?
Nine thirty-two. Our boy has arrived.
[MEN CHATTERING]
Thank God your mother, my sister, is dead, Barry.
Having a son this stupid would have killed her for sure.
I told you not to hit Boyette, you did.
I told you not to tell Romey too much, you did.
I hope it hurt that fat bastard.
I hope that bullet was slow.
I hope he felt the top of his head pull right off his face.
Two kids found him, Barry, maybe before he finished the job.
- Yeah, I know, I seen it on TV.
- There's a chance he might have talked.
Tell me Boyette's body's somewhere the cops can't find.
The cops are not gonna find the body.
Move the body, Barry.
I will, Uncle Johnny.
Only I can't right now.
Why?
Where it's at, the body, the cops are swarming all over the place.
Don't worry, they're not gonna find the body.
If that kid knows anything, he's not talking, otherwise I wouldn't be standing here.
I'm going to Memphis and I'm gonna take care of those kids.
SULARI:
I'll tell you what you do.
You just sit on your dumb ass.
- Gronke.
- Mm-hm.
SULARI: I want you in Memphis.
- Uh-huh.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
MAN:
Come.
Oh, you must be Mark.
Hi, Mark.
Jason McThune, Memphis FBI.
This is Larry Trumann from New Orleans FBI.
This is Thomas Fink, assistant United States attorney...
...and Mr. Foltrigg, United States attorney.
Both from southern Louisiana.
Sit down, son.
- Come on over here, Mark. Sit down.
- There you are.
We expected your mother. Where is she?
She's upstairs with my little brother.
She can't leave in case he wakes up.
But, you know, we could hold this off for a couple of days.
No, Mark, let's talk a few minutes, just us.
- You nervous?
- A little.
[CHUCKLES]
- Do I need a lawyer?
- Heh, what for?
To protect my rights.
FINK:
No, heh, you been watching too much TV.
We just wanna ask you some questions.
You can trust us.
Lawyers just get in the way.
They object to everything.
What if I don't answer your questions?
We might have to take you downtown.
Might take your mother too.
- Will my mother get in trouble?
- Maybe.
You ever hear of obstruction of justice,
Mark? It's a federal offense.
It means if a man knows something about a crime...
...and withholds information from the FBI or the police, well, he might be punished.
You know, sent to jail or something like that.
So what you're trying to say is, is if I don't answer your questions, I could go to jail?
Maybe.
Gosh, man, if y'all was in my place, wouldn't y'all want a lawyer?
Hell no, they're a pain in the ass.
You don't need a lawyer.
- Pain in the ass?
- Mm-hm.
But aren't you a lawyer?
Jerome Clifford wasn't really dead when you found him, was he?
- Yes, he was.
- We know you were in that car, Mark.
You see that?
You and Romey had a nice long chat, didn't you?
What'd y'all talk about?
Did you talk about life? Talk about love?
Y'all talk about where bodies are buried?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Answer the question first, please, Mark.
I've gotta go bad. Please?
Well, you'd better go.
Thanks.
[DOOR OPENS]
- Ha, ha.
- You don't need no stinking lawyer, heh.
Hell no, heh. This boy's about ready to tell all. You know where Muldano's at?
- We're on his ass 24 hours a day.
- Better grab him so he don't skip town.
Don't mark up his face.
We can do the press conference here.
Hold on till we grab Muldano.
I wanna make sure those affidavits are set so he can't make bail.
Did you get my makeup off the plane?
I'm gonna need Pancake number 17.
Doughnuts. Doughnuts.
Give me that telephone.
Press loves coffee and doughnuts.
See what you can do.
Where we gonna put me?
Down by the flags?
I think I look best in front of these glass bricks. ..
...behind a big bank of microphones.
That always looks nice, doesn't it, heh?
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
FINK: I'll call you back.
- Come in, Mark.
- Polite kid.
- Yeah, he's a good boy.
- Oh, keep your seats.
LARRY: We're in a meeting.
McTHUNE: I think you're in the wrong room.
- I don't think so.
Uh, my name is Reggie Love,
I'm an attorney and I represent Mark Sway.
Uh, may I see some ID, please?
When, uh, did he hire you?
I don't think that's really any of your business, now is it?
Gonna have to forgive us, Ms. Love.
You're so pretty, how could anybody mistake you for a lawyer?
[CHUCKLES]
- Please, call me Reggie...
ROY: Reggie.
...Roy.
Uh-- So, uh, did you in fact--
Oh, please, sit down.
--attempt to interrogate my client, uh, outside the presence of his mother, Jason?
No.
He tells me that you did, Lawrence.
He's confused.
We assumed his mother was on her way down.
- Where were you during this?
- Oh, that's not really relevant.
Uh, did you advise him that he should talk to an attorney, Thomas?
- No, uh-- Yes.
- Did I--?
Remember, once, Larry, uh,
Mark said something, or I did, about TV...
...and then, uh, Mark said that, heh, he might need a lawyer...
...and, uh, we--
I thought he was just joking.
So he never asked you guys if he needed a lawyer?
I don't remember it that way.
Did you advise him of his Miranda rights?
No, heh, what for? He's not a criminal.
We just wanted to ask him a few questions.
You did attempt to interrogate him outside the presence of his mother?
McTHUNE: No.
- Definitely not.
No way.
[CHUCKLES]
Bullshit.
Uh.. ..
Tread carefully. We know your client lied about being in that car.
I think that's a bit of the pot calling the kettle black.
MARK: Do I need a lawyer?
FINK: Heh, what for?
MARK:
To protect my rights.
FINK:
No, heh, you been watching too much TV.
LARRY: We just wanna ask some questions.
You can trust us.
FINK: Lawyers just get in the way.
They object to everything.
- You wired the kid.
- It's nothing personal, Lawrence.
McTHUNE:
--take your mother too.
You attempted to interrogate a child. ..
...outside the presence of his mother and without her consent.
He asked you if he needed a lawyer and you said no...
...stating as one of your reasons that lawyers are a pain in the ass.
I'd like to confer with my client...
...and meet with you people in my office tomorrow around 3:00.
And if I need anything from you boys, like the truth, well I expect to get it.
I catch you lying again...
...I'm gonna use the tape.
That's blackmail, Ms. Love.
Indict me, Reverend Roy.
[DOOR OPENS]
[CHUCKLES]
[DOOR CLOSES]
McTHUNE:
Still want those doughnuts?
Shut up, McThune. Goddamn.
DIANNE: You want a cigarette?
REGGIE: Oh, no thanks, I just quit.
DIANNE: There's been a mistake, ma'am.
We can't afford no lawyer.
REGGIE: Don't worry about the money.
DIANE: My pig boss fired me this morning.
I mean, my baby's in a coma and he fires me.
- Don't tell Mark.
- Just one day and he fired you? He is a pig.
Sucks.
Wasn't much of a job anyways.
Five bucks an hour at a lamp factory.
How long you been working there?
Huh?
- How long you been--?
- Oh, uh. ... Six months.
Oh.
- Lord, I can't keep my head on straight.
- You're doing fine.
I like your ring.
They real diamonds?
Lord, no. It's semi-precious.
You got kids?
Gosh, you must have been just a baby when you started having your babies.
I was just a dumb kid living in a dream.
All I ever wanted was a white house with a walk-in closet.
[CHUCKLES]
Ain't that stupid?
No. Having a dream's never stupid.
Take it one day at a time, that's what I say.
[MIMICKING GUITAR]
Come on, Ricky, you always laugh at my air guitar.
Who's the best guitarist in the whole world? Who?
Come on, Ricky, say it.
Yell it.
I know, heh.
Ah, look, Ricky, an Eskimo pissing.
[GROANING]
[SIGHS]
Ricky, look at you.
[SIGHS]
I shouldn't have made you stay in those woods. It's my fault.
But things are gonna be all right,
Ricky, I swear.
I've got us a lawyer...
...and even though she is a woman, she's pretty darn good, heh.
She only costs a dollar too, heh.
That's not it though.
I'm really sorry.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
I promise.
[CAMERA CLICKING]
Hey.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hi, Slick Moeller, Memphis Press.
I wrote the story this morning.
How's your brother?
- Get out of here! Get out!
- How's your brother?
Heh, just a second, son,
I just wanna ask you a few questions.
- Did Clifford touch you any place?
- Get out! Just shut up!
Did he tell you why he was committing suicide?
- Did he?
- You better get out of here.
- Did he talk to you at all?
- Get out!
I'll tell you what, I'll pay you.
Exclusive interview.
DOCTOR: Outside.
- Cops say you know more.
Mark, are you all right?
NANCE:
You understand I can't do it by day?
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN:
You Nance, private investigator?
Security specialist. Who's asking?
[SIGHS]
Name's Gronke. I need some fast work.
Who referred you?
Sulari, New Orleans.
I get $2000 cash retainer, non-refundable, before I lift a finger.
You like kids?
First thing we'll do is--
--is scheduled to be finished--
Why do you think Foltrigg was so--?
Mark, we're almost through.
Could you listen up, huh?
[TV CLICKS OFF]
Thank you.
Why do you think Foltrigg was so convinced you were in Clifford's car?
I don't know.
If I'm gonna be your attorney, you have to trust me.
I do trust you, Reggie.
I swear, I wasn't in that car.
You like Led Zeppelin?
Yeah. Do you like Led Zeppelin?
Oh, yeah. They were a great band.
I'll bet you never even heard of Led Zeppelin.
You're probably one of them grown-ups who just say they like really cool bands. ..
...just to get close to little punks like me.
Well, I think we've covered just about everything.
All right, what's your favorite Zeppelin song?
Uh, "Moby Dick," live version.
Bitching drum solo.
I'll pick you up tomorrow about 2:30, okay?
What were the names of their first four albums, Miss Groupie?
You tell Reverend Roy what you told me...
...and that'll probably be the last we'll hear from him, okay?
Hmm?
What happens if you lie to the FBI?
It's a federal offense.
In theory, you could go to jail. Why?
You weren't smoking something besides cigarettes in that woods, were you?
- No, ma'am.
- Is there something you're not telling me?
I'm positive
I'm not keeping something from you.
I mean, I was just curious.
Okay.
Oh, the first Led Zeppelin albums were called I, II and III.
The fourth, which is actually untitled, is generally referred to as IV.
See you tomorrow, groupie.
Andy, it's the space people.
They've come back, I knew they would.
Hello, out there?
Just be peaceful.
We're-- We're friendly, don't be afraid.
My assistant will now approach you, do not hurt him.
NANCE: Want one?
- Huh?
Elvis Pezley.
Heh, Elvis Pezley.
Bet it's poisoned.
- She's funny, isn't she?
- Yeah.
My boy loves her.
[SIGHS]
Sorry. My boy was in a car wreck.
Drunk driver.
Don't know if he's gonna make it.
- He's only 8.
- My brother's only 8.
He's really sick.
- What's wrong with him?
- He saw something, is all.
You're not the kids who saw that suicide guy, are you?
- Mm-hm.
- I seen it on TV.
Jesus. That must have been awful.
- How's your brother doing?
- He just lays there.
Man, oh, man.
What a scary thing for a kid to see.
I wasn't scared.
Jesus, he must have been out of his mind to stick a gun in his mouth like that.
I mean, why?
Was he acting weird or yelling crazy stuff, or. ..?
Maybe he said something scary to your little brother. That could be.
Well, dude, I gotta go.
- Well, I hope your brother gets better.
MARK: Yeah.
[PHONE RINGS]
MARK:
Karen?
- Where's Karen?
- Off duty, hon. Get you anything?
You got anything to eat around here?
- Cafeteria's open 24 hours.
- All right.
Hey, kid, can I have your autograph?
[CHUCKLES]
WOMAN 1:
They said they were all on vacation.
WOMAN 2:
Lots of attitude, you know?
WOMAN 1:
But I want them on, you see.
[MARK PANTING]
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just fine.
[MARK GASPS]
Now, you listen to me, Mark Sway.
I don't know what Romey told you, but you repeat a single word to anyone...
...including your bitch lawyer,
I'll kill you.
You talk to the feds tomorrow,
I'll kill you.
And if you tell anyone about me,
I'll kill you slow.
You understand me, little big boy?
You understand?
[MARK GASPING]
Good. We have an understanding.
Now, I'm gonna be watching you, boy.
HOOSER:
So everybody in New Orleans knew...
...that Muldano and Boyette were in bed together.
REGGIE:
Boyette got himself killed.
He took money from the Mafia to build a toxic-waste dump...
...then when his constituents got pissed, he voted against it.
- Enter Barry "The Blade."
- Right, if Foltrigg can prove it.
Why would Foltrigg risk bringing in
Muldano if he didn't have Boyette's body?
I think this guy's gonna run for office.
What are we serving?
- It's Thursday.
- Southern pecan.
- Something wrong? Your brother all right?
- I ain't talking to the FBI and that's final.
Mark, you have to talk with the FBI.
If you don't, they could subpoena you.
Foltrigg is gonna be here any minute.
I said, no. Now, you're my lawyer and you have to do what I tell you.
WOMAN:
Reverend Roy, I saw you on TV.
- Oh, he's so handsome.
- This place is a dump.
- Yeah, you can say that again.
- My Lord.
REGGIE: Are you--?
- They are coming down the hall.
Make them go away. Please.
All right, stay here. Stay out of sight.
Something's up. I don't get it, but I will do it. Just sit down.
Good afternoon, Ms. Love.
Is young master Sway all ready?
Roy, I'm sorry, but the meeting's been canceled.
Oh, ahem.
I beg your pardon?
Why don't you let me debrief the child and give you a statement in writing?
- You and I know he doesn't know anything.
- Uh, we need to talk to this child, Reggie.
We have a set of confirmed fingerprints that put him inside Jerome Clifford's car.
Now, what you and I gonna do about that, heh?
- Well, I think that the big question is...
- Shit.
...how did you match his fingerprints?
We lifted one off a soda can at the hospital.
And did you ask either Mark Sway or his mother before doing so?
So you invaded the privacy of an 11-year-old child?
- We were just trying to obtain evidence.
REGGIE: Evidence for what?
So his prints are inside the car.
You have absolutely no proof that he even interacted with Clifford.
Kid has a bruise on his left cheekbone.
We found a spot of blood on Clifford's ring, not his type.
Well, let me guess.
Mark Sway's blood type?
That's right, heh.
And how did you obtain
Mark Sway's blood type?
From his brother's hospital admission records.
And how did you obtain confidential hospital records?
- Look here now--
- No, you look here.
If you get near my client again without my permission...
...I'm gonna sue you and the FBI for civil rights violations...
...file an ethics complaint with the state bar and I'm gonna haul your ass into court.
You're playing big league hardball here.
We don't respond to threats.
Does Mark Sway's mother know you been institutionalized. ..
...for drug and alcohol abuse?
Huh?
It was a treatment center.
You just close the door when you leave.
Reggie?
Listen, you been practicing law for 2 years, you're not equipped to handle this case.
We know more about your client's actions than you do. You're an amateur, Reggie.
Your client's in serious peril.
You think that over.
Open that door, let me talk to him.
You are so good.
But I'm not gonna let you use this child to climb into the governor's chair.
You think you look good on TV?
If you or your guys attempt to contact my client or his family again. ..
...I'm gonna put little Mark Sway on the news prime time.
He can tell everybody how you trampled the constitutional rights of an 11-year-old.
And I got the tape to prove it.
We'll talk to that boy.
You miss one step, I'll eat you alive.
Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna kill that kid.
You been lying to me. You got till three to start telling the truth. One, two--
You're the liar!
Keep the dollar, you're fired!
REGGIE: What are you talking--?
You come back here. Come back here.
Mark. Shit, where are my car keys?
- Where did I put my car keys?
- In your purse.
REGGIE:
Mark.
- Mark, get in the car. Come on.
- No.
- Mark, please.
- No.
REPORTER 1:
Mark. Mark.
- Mark.
REPORTER 2: Mark, a couple quick questions.
How'd you like the story this morning?
REGGIE:
Move on.
[REPORTERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
One question!
ROY:
That kid didn't hire a lawyer for his health.
LARRY:
He knows where that body is.
Even the Mob knows he knows, that's why they flew in Gronke.
You got it, Wally?
We gotta get our hands on that child before the Mob does.
Here. We can petition the juvenile court alleging the boy's in need of supervision.
And protection.
Gronke's not here to visit Graceland.
We explain to the judge it's in the kid's best interest to take him into protective custody.
To get the judge to make him talk--
- We allege the kid's breaking the law.
- He is. He's obstructing justice.
You file those petitions.
Incarcerate his young ass tonight.
Where are we? You said we was just getting rid of the reporters.
You see any reporters around?
This is my mama's house.
MARK: You live with your mother?
REGGIE: Ha, ha. This is Momma Love.
Hi there. You must be Mark.
Take me back to the hospital.
Listen, you and I are gonna do some talking first.
- Talk my ass, you're fired!
- Fine.
You're the boss.
This is kidnapping or something!
Take me back right now!
I'll hitchhike if I have to!
REGGIE:
Go ahead.
[GRUNTS]
Nice meeting you, Mark.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
GRONKE: Who is it?
BONO: Your mother.
[CHUCKLES]
Hey, Bono.
How you doing, Paulie?
Guess Johnny means business, bringing you here.
- Where's the kid?
- With that bitch lawyer.
Got a private dick tailing him.
Any sign of the fibbies?
Yeah, a couple, watching the hospital, same as we are.
I gave that kid a little warning last night.
This is the directive:
We bug everything, hospital room, lawyer's office, the works.
Find out what the kid knows.
That doesn't work, we kill them all.
REGGIE:
How's he doing?
MOMMA:
Oh, when he gets hungry, he'll come in.
REGGIE: It's a lucky thing a car only comes by here every four hours.
That is one willful child, Regina.
Pain in the butt, if you ask me.
Ahem, that's the pot calling the kettle black.
- Hey, man.
MARK: Hey.
How you doing? You remember me?
You're the kid at the hospital, right?
MARK:
Uh-huh.
Well, hop in. I'll give you a ride.
Come on now.
What are you doing out here anyway?
Come on, hop in.
Hey, you know, my boy's getting much better.
How's your brother doing?
Come on back here.
- Elvis has left the building.
- Told you so.
[DOOR CLOSES]
MOMMA: Why, hello there.
- Take me back to the hospital.
- Want some lemonade?
- I'm not taking you anywhere...
- ...until we've had a conversation.
- Or a piece of pie?
Where's a phone? I need to call a cab.
Help yourself.
It's, uh, 40 dollars from here, Momma?
Or 45? I'm not sure, something with a tip.
Look, you're fired, okay?
Can't you get that through your thick head?
Fine. Because I cannot do my job if you keep hiding things from me.
Did it ever occur to you how it made me feel to take on Foltrigg on your behalf...
...without the facts?
I should've smelled your breath before I hired you. ..
- ...then I would've known you was a drunk.
- Well, I think I'll be going.
I have been sober for 3 years.
Yeah, right. That's what all the drunks say.
How they gonna get sober and all.
They even say they love you, but they don't.
Then they come home wasted and beat on you and your mother so bad...
...you gotta hit them in the face with a baseball bat.
You're talking about your daddy, aren't you?
Yeah, well I got rid of him.
When me and my mom went into court to buy a divorce...
...our lawyer sucked, as usual.
So I went up there and told the judge myself about all the beatings...
...and about how he made us sleep in the street.
And that's when my father became my ex-father.
And now I got you, and you're a drunk and a bad lawyer too.
So now I'm getting rid of you.
You're fired, okay?
I can handle this myself.
Mark.
Mark, I used to think
I could handle everything by myself.
But sometimes being strong means asking for help.
I know you've been taking real good care of your family...
...but the FBI’s not gonna leave you alone.
- You gotta let me help you.
- Let go.
- I need a cigarette.
- Smoking is terrible for you.
Hey, hey, hey.
What did Romey tell you in that car?
God, why do I always have to answer questions?
Why don't you ever have to answer any questions?
Okay, that's fair.
Go ahead, ask me something.
Like what?
Whatever you want. Go ahead, there's no rules, there's no limits.
You ask me and I will answer.
And you'll tell the truth?
If it takes my skin off.
All right.
What's that thing you always wear around your neck?
This is my mamaw's compass.
I wear it so I'll never lose my way again.
Hmm.
Anything else?
Yeah. These your kids?
- Yes.
- They chained down in the basement?
Heh, close. They're with their daddy.
- There was a divorce.
- You ever see them?
- They don't really wanna see me.
- Because you was drunk and on drugs.
Because after the divorce
I drank some, yes.
I drank a lot.
Why?
You're right, there must be a cigarette around here someplace.
Uh, I married a big Memphis doctor, worked my ass off to put him through medical school. ..
...and soon as he became rich and famous, he traded me in for a younger model.
I didn't have a dollar to put food in the fridge. ..
...or a car to go look for a job.
But I figured I could handle it myself, just like you.
But I was wrong.
- So then you started to drink?
- Mm-mm.
First, I stopped sleeping and eating.
I was scared to death. I kept staying up every night, watching my babies. ..
...trying to figure out what I was gonna do.
Finally, I took some pills to sleep.
Hell, he prescribed them for me.
I was not trying to kill myself.
But that's when he pounced.
Got himself a fancy lawyer.
I didn't have anybody.
I figured after all those years of blowing noses and wiping butts...
...fixing meals and carpooling the kids every which way...
...that it'd count for something.
I was a fool.
The court declared me unfit.
Just like that, they were gone.
He took...
...my little girl and my little boy, heh.
Anyhow, that's when I started drinking.
But I got myself sober...
...I stayed sober. ..
...and I put myself through law school.
- Do you miss your kids?
- Heh.
So much
I try not to even think about them.
He told me.
Romey told me where the body's buried.
Do you wanna tell me?
I can call the police and put an end to this right now.
But I swore an oath that I wouldn't tell nobody.
They're gonna get me, Reggie.
I seen it on TV.
The Mob never forgets.
Oh, my God.
They came after you, didn't they?
- Yes, ma'am.
- I gotta get security on your brother's room.
And notify the police and get you out of here...
...back to the hospital where you'll be safe.
Reggie. ..
...I'm scared.
What's up?
He's in there. But y'all gonna have to deal with the two bitches.
What do you think?
I got an idea.
[CHATTERING]
It's gonna take at least a week to get that kid into protective custody.
We still gotta find a way to make him talk.
I want that kid in court and on the stand mañana.
- You hear what I'm telling you?
- Yes, but--
Let me have the phone.
I know how to solve this.
Don't you have something to do?
Why don't you go wake somebody up?
- Mr. Foltrigg? May I have your autograph?
- Of course you can.
Thomas, let me encourage you to produce me some immediate results...
...in the interest of your own personal job security right, by God, now.
What's your name?
Our trailer....
They burned down our home.
We got nothing left.
Who did?
How the hell do I know?
Somebody, they saw two people, they was leaving and.. ..
It's all gone. All of it.
- Mom, it's my fault.
- Dianne, I'm so sorry.
Look, it's gonna be all right.
Do you know if you have insurance?
That is none of your business, really.
REGGIE:
I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.
- I was just trying to help, is all.
- What is this crap?
Oh, heh.
A few things I put together to make you feel more comfortable--
- I don't need your charity.
- It's not charity--
DIANNE: And I don't need you trying to come in here and take away my son.
- Mark's already got a mother!
REGGIE: I know that. You're doing a fine job.
DIANNE: I don't need your help.
- Look, I'm sorry--
Get out!
Sure.
Reggie.
- Reggie, you okay?
- I'm fine.
HOOSER:
They got her on all kinds of medication.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I had no call to speak to her that way, Lord.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hello.
I'm Detective Ed Nassar, Memphis P.D.
- You Dianne Sway?
- Yeah.
These are from juvenile court. It's a summons for a hearing at 10 tomorrow.
The summons requires us to take young Mark into custody at this time.
What? You can't take my son.
- Well, we're gonna have to.
- You son of a bitch.
- Easy now.
- Over my dead body.
- It's for his own good.
- What's he done? Just tell me.
Can somebody help me?
Don't touch him.
NASSAR: The petition was filed because he will not cooperate--
Son of a bitch!
- Come on. Come on.
DIANNE: Help.
[NASSAR GRUNTS]
NASSAR: Come on. Calm down. Calm down.
DIANNE: Unh, help me.
[ALL GRUNT]
- Mark.
HARDY: Come on.
NASSAR: There's no reason to get excited.
We'll take good care of him.
[DIANNE GRUNTS]
NASSAR: Give it up. Come on.
- Get off of me!
Come on, now, you're getting yourself all riled up.
Agh!
[SCREAMS]
They're taking me to jail!
I'm an 11-year-old!
- They hit my mother!
- Shut up, Markus.
Hey, you gonna read me my rights?
Hey, meathead, you even know how to read?
- You gonna cuff me?
- This is not an arrest.
- Then what the hell is it?
- Watch your mouth, kid.
Kiss my ass, you stupid jerk.
[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
He's all yours.
Oh.
Calm down.
Empty your pockets.
[INMATES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
WOMAN:
Okay, now follow me.
McTHUNE: There you are.
- I don't look bad.
McTHUNE:
You look good.
[PHONE RINGS]
- Ahem, all right.
LARRY: Unh.
- Hello?
- I twisted every arm, I broke every leg.
You got what you want.
The kid's in custody.
- You got your hearing tomorrow at 10a.m.
- I knew you could do it, Jason.
Well done, heh.
- One child in jail.
- All right.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
- What kind of place is this?
- Women's detention hall.
- Keep the noise down!
- Why am I being put in with the women?
Because you're a minor.
Stop treating me like a kid.
Put me where the men are.
You're safer here.
You have this whole cell to yourself.
- Is this what they mean by solitary?
- No.
You can have any bed you want.
Don't give me any trouble.
You okay, boy?
Can I call my mom?
Just to tell her where I'm at and that I'm okay.
Please, she's probably worried sick about me.
I suppose I could run a phone in here.
I'll make this little exception, just this once.
Thank you, ma'am.
[LINE RINGS]
WOMAN [OVER PHONE]:
Brother's Pizza.
Uh, yes, I would like to order
20 of your largest Supremes.
Okay, and where's that going, honey?
Uh, I'm ordering for Detective Nassar,
North Precinct.
Okay, and how would you like to pay for this order?
- Well, with my credit card.
- Number, please.
The number is 4000-0306...
Okay, hold on.
That'll be $248.10.
Fine. Cheaper than the last time.
- Oh, well.
- Thank you.
[CHUCKLES]
REGGIE: We'll never get him out tonight.
Foltrigg filed a custody petition.
- Roosevelt scheduled a hearing for 10.
- Ten?
There's three to seven days after filing a petition, not hours.
REGGIE:
That damn Foltrigg, he'll do anything.
HOOSER: Got that right.
REGGIE: A child behind bars for the night.
I have been through this wallet three times,
I have found everything except my Visa.
MAN:
Man, these things are hot.
Hi. Did y'all order the pizzas?
[SIGHS]
[MUTTERING]
[CHUCKLES]
My, my, my.
You didn't have to sign a custody order.
I would've brought him here.
- Good morning to you too, Reggie.
- What is going on?
According to the FBI...
...a Mr. Paul Gronke and his pal, Bono, have just arrived in our fair city.
- You ever heard of these guys?
- No.
- Your client could be in a world of danger.
- Oh, shit.
What does the child know?
- You know that's privileged.
- So he knows more than he should?
If he did know something, would you guarantee him witness protection...
...complete relocation for his mother, his brother and him?
Well, this is not standard.
Ugh, damn it, Harry.
Why should he talk if we can't protect him?
Forgive my presumption here, Reggie, but you do seem overly agitated.
Whatever became of that...
...objectivity we used to fight about over at Memphis State?
After all...
...he is just a client, isn't he?
[SIGHS]
I'm sorry, I just didn't get much sleep.
It's just that...
...he's never had a break and he's counting on me.
Hey.
Huh.
- Thanks, Doreen.
- Good luck.
- Brought your jacket.
- Thanks.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
You sure clean up good.
You too.
MARK: Why can't I just tell them
I don't know nothing, Reggie?
REGGIE: Because it's wrong.
Because it's against the law.
And besides, nobody's gonna believe you.
Not the Mob, not the FBI, nobody.
And besides that,
Barry Muldano's a killer.
You've got a chance to stop him before he hurts somebody else.
Didn't you tell the truth in divorce court, about being a good mom and all?
- Yes.
- Proof, the truth hurts.
- They took your kids away.
- All right, you're right, you're right.
But, Mark, don't you see, if you lie, you're gonna be just like them.
If I tell the truth, he'll kill me.
All right.
Look, have you ever--?
Have you ever heard of the witness-protection program?
[CHUCKLES]
Lord, yes. That's where they put you in those funny mustaches...
...and send you off to New Jersey or someplace to live.
I saw it on TV.
But the guy in the TV movie, the Mob found him anyways...
...and they blew his legs off.
You saw that on TV?
[REPORTERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Reggie, no matter what I do,
I could probably get killed.
- You can't let them ask me any questions.
- I'll try, Mark.
But if Foltrigg gets you on that stand. ..
...you can't lie or you'll be just like them.
- Okay?
MAN: Court is in session.
Mark.
My, we certainly have drawn a crowd this morning. Officer?
I'm Sergeant Hardy.
What are you doing in my court wearing a firearm?
Wait....
ROOSEVELT:
Thank you. You may go.
And you, Mr. Moeller.
Your coverage of the case has led me to consider having you indicted. ..
...for reckless endangerment.
But, Your Honor--
Another word and I will slap you with contempt.
Good day, sir.
Well now, that's better.
Shall we proceed?
Your honor, I'd like to note for the record that the child's without custodial parent.
Request postponement until she can appear.
I'm Thomas Fink, assistant U.S. attorney for eastern Louisiana.
I'd like to address this issue of the absence of the child's mother.
It's our position, the position of the petitioners--
Your position, Mr. Fink, is in that chair.
Please sit.
And listen carefully,
I'll only say this once.
- Judge Roosevelt--
ROOSEVELT: As for you, Mr. Foltrigg...
...this is not New Orleans and I'm not one of your federal judges.
This is my private courtroom and I make the rules.
Rule number one:
You will speak only when spoken to.
Rule number two: Do not grace His Honor with unsolicited commentary.
Rule number three: His Honor does not like to listen to the voice of U.S. attorneys...
...who love to hear themselves speak.
Do you understand these rules, gentlemen?
Mr. Foltrigg? You want Mr. Fink to handle the case for the prosecution?
Yes, sir. If it please the court, sir.
I'll allow it, but try and keep his butt in that seat, please.
- Sir.
ROOSEVELT: Court will act in loco parentis.
- Heh.
- Shh.
I'll watch out for the child's interests in this hearing, Ms. Love. Proceed.
The child moves to dismiss on grounds the allegations are without merit.
The petition has been filed to explore things the child might know.
- Quit calling me "the child."
- Quiet, young man.
Proceed.
Mr. Foltrigg and Mr. Fink are using this hearing as a fishing expedition.
Their supposition that the-- My client...
...had any legally significant conversation with Mr. Clifford...
...is based on purely circumstantial evidence.
The petition should be dismissed and we should go home.
- Your Honor, if I may?
- You may.
The child is the last person to see Jerome Clifford alive.
Now, we have established this child willfully deceived us.
A set of fingerprints on a Cadillac is hardly willful deceit.
We can show the child's fingerprints on the suicide hose and on the gun itself.
We feel the child must testify for his own good in order to exonerate himself.
Mr. Fink, are you attempting to implicate this child in Clifford's suicide?
No, we are not. Currently, we are alleging only obstruction of justice.
Now, involvement in a suicide could constitute juvenile delinquency.
This child could be removed from his mother's care.
Your Honor, there's no basis for this.
Your Honor, we are only asking that the child testify to clear his good name.
We're not forcing the child to testify.
Not yet.
Ms. Love, will your client testify and put an end to this foolishness?
REGGIE:
And if we refuse?
Well, I don't like it, but I'd have to lock him back up till we sort this out.
[WHISPERS]
No.
Your Honor, the child moves for a change of venue.
Since the alleged murder of Boyette occurred in Louisiana...
...we would like a relocation to that locality.
As the United States attorney for eastern Louisiana, I waive venue. ..
The child declines.
...and release the proceedings to your jurisdiction.
The child declines.
That's a pretty suit.
Drop dead, Roy.
All right, you two. Just settle down.
Nice try, but I think it would be in everybody's best interests...
...for Mark to take the stand.
- Your Honor--
- That's my ruling, counselor.
Mark, I want you to come up here and take this seat right by me.
It's okay.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
FINK:
Mm-hm.
Put up your right hand, Mark.
You swear to tell the truth?
You have to say it.
I swear.
ROOSEVELT: Okay. Mr. Fink is gonna ask you some questions.
He'll keep them clear and simple, understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Fink.
- May I rise?
ROOSEVELT: Mr. Fink.
How you doing, Mark?
Mark, were you forced into the car with Mr. Clifford before he died?
Yes, sir.
Did you and Mr. Clifford have a conversation?
- Yes, sir.
FINK: Listen up.
Did Mr. Clifford mention Barry Muldano or Senator Boyd Boyette?
You answer the question, Mark.
- Is taking the Fifth Amendment lying?
- Heh.
ROOSEVELT:
No, it's not lying.
- Well, can I take the Fifth Amendment?
- No, you cannot.
Why not? It applies to kids, doesn't it?
Not in this case, Mark.
You're not implicated in the death of Senator Boyette...
...so you'll have to answer the question.
Your Honor, as Mr. Foltrigg has done so thorough a job...
...in attempting to implicate Mark,
I must, out of an abundance of caution...
...advise my client to take the Fifth.
Haven't we played enough games here?
We are all searchers for the truth.
A man's been murdered and another man lies dead by his own hand...
...yet this boy remains silent.
What wanton hubris is this?
Speak, child, now.
Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, so sayeth the Psalm.
That's Proverbs, 12:22.
This is still a courtroom, not a church, Mr. Foltrigg.
Please, sit down.
Did Romey Clifford tell you where Boyd Boyette's body's at, son?
ROOSEVELT:
Mr. Foltrigg.
Yes, sir.
Answer the question, Mark.
I take the Fifth Amendment.
I'm sorry, but I can't answer any of these questions...
...because I'm afraid of what might happen to me or my family.
I have no choice but to return you to protective custody.
FINK:
Ah, all right, this is over yet.
ROOSEVELT:
Sorry, Mark, it's for your own protection.
Why can't you get him to answer the question?
These proceedings are closed.
- I didn't lie, Reggie.
- You did great.
What kind of a lawyer tells a child to plead the Fifth. ..
...send him back to jail and hold up a federal investigation?
You trying to ruin this boy's life or just flat-out get him killed?
You did real good, Reggie.
NANCE: We alone?
- Yeah, we're alone.
What happened?
- Heh, I was looking for a little more this time.
- What?
I asked you a question.
Kid's going back to jail.
Roosevelt just wants to keep him safe.
- What's he know?
- I'd say he knows everything.
The bastard. Harry wants him back in court tomorrow at noon. ..
...to see if a night in the slammer changes his mind.
- You didn't hear this from me.
- Shut up.
Come on, man, give me a little break here, would you?
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Get out of my way.
Go powder your nose.
What is it? I'm eating here.
I just talked to Gronke in Memphis.
What can I get you?
Dos Equis.
- Where's your regular waiter?
- I don't know.
Cops got the kid.
I still can't move the stiff.
You're a dumb-ass, you know that?
We've had this conversation.
MULDANO [ON HEADPHONE]:
I'm sick of it. I deserve respect.
- Nice work, Ron.
- Thanks.
MULDANO: Just once, Uncle Johnny....
- Picking it up just fine.
We still need to make the move.
That little bastard knows something.
Probably told his lawyer.
We're tapping the phones.
I hate goddamn lawyers.
Please, just let me hit the kid.
We got nothing to worry about from that kid.
- Let's call the whole thing quits.
- That kid knows--
Goddamn bugs.
The city's lousy with them.
You're probably right, Uncle Johnny.
Kid knows nothing.
They're onto us.
We're out of business.
So we're just gonna put this whole thing behind us. Is that clear?
I got it, Uncle Johnny.
MOMMA: Regina, what are you doing?
REGGIE: Nothing, Momma, you go back to bed.
Have you any idea what time it is?
Momma, have you seen my notebooks from school?
In the garage, maybe.
- Huh? Garage? Oh, shit, yeah.
- Baby, you need to get some sleep.

- What are you being so nice to them for?
Because they're cute.
They're just trying to be protective.

I've busted out of jail.
You've gotta come get me.
Jeannette. It's Jeannette.
Oh.
It's Jeannette.
REGGIE:
What are you doing calling me so late?
Who's Jeannette?
I'm at St. Peter's, hiding out.
- What?
- I ran in place for an hour...
...and I faked an attack of post-traumatic stress disorder, heh.
They rushed me right over.
It was easy as pie.
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
I locked a Mafia guy in the morgue who was trying to kill me.
MAN 1: You go down the hall.
MAN 2: I hear something down the hallway.
Mark, go find yourself a policeman right now.
MAN 1: Found someone locked up in a cooler.
MAN 2:
You kidding me?
I'm not going back to jail.
Reggie, if you don't come and get me,
I'm gonna go where I'm going on my own.
- No, no, no.
- I'm serious. You've gotta come get me.
Now, you're the only friend I've got, and you know that. Don't let me down.
Shit.
Um. ...
I'll meet you by the front, uh, parking lot in a dark gray Honda.
Okay. Right in front of the cross.
The big one.
Thank you, Reggie. Thanks.
HOOSER: My dark gray Honda?
- Just give me the keys.
You can't run away with an escaped whatever the hell he is.
They'll arrest you for contributing.
You'll be disbarred. You've lost your mind.
Momma, I need you to distract the police.
I'm gonna go out the back.
Go get them a coffee or something, and don't ask me any questions, please.
- Oh, I need some cash.
- Come on, Reg, this is my rent money.
I know, but you can live with Momma.
She likes you better than me anyway.
Well, that wouldn't be hard.

OFFICER:
Nobody gets in.

REGGIE:
Get in.
Stay down.
Your mama must be beside herself.
I called her from the morgue and told her we'd fix everything.
- We?
- You're an accomplice now, aren't you?
Shit.
We're, uh, watching the mother's room in case he tries to get to her.
We put a bug in her phone.
Anybody talk to her?
- You said you wanted to be the first.
- I do.
ROY: Ahem, you know your boy's missing.
- Missing? You mean you lost him.
Has he tried to contact you tonight?
Uh-uh.
You searched the hospital?
He knows it real well, you know.
Yes, we have searched the hospital.
Uh, Reggie Love is missing too.
Do you think Mark could be with her?
Hell, y'all are the FBI.
Since you got involved, our trailer's been blown up. ..
...my boy's been thrown in jail, and now he's missing.
So let me tell you something.
Act like the FBI. You find him.
- Head towards the bridge.
- Why?
Well, I been thinking.
That witness-protection thing sounds pretty good.
- Mm-hm.
- But Romey was all drunk and on pills.
What if the body ain't where he said, would we still get protection?
We make our deal before we tell them where the body is...
...and then just keep our fingers crossed.
So first we gotta be sure the body's even there, right?
What are you getting at?
We gotta go to New Orleans. ..
...and try and find Boyette's body's where Romey said it is.
You are out of your mind.
No way. Absolutely not. That's it.
Where are you going? You-- Wait-- Stay.
Damn it.
Get back in the car. Mark.
Where are you going? Mark.
- Someone's gonna see you.
- Let me go, I'll hitchhike if I have to.
You are crazy.
You're gonna get yourself killed.
A lot of other people could get killed if I don't go.
- Mark.
- I'll do it on my own if I have to.
Mark, please. Please.
Remember at Momma Love's...
...what you told me about, well, asking people for help?
- Yeah.
- I guess now I'm asking you.
Please?
Hey, where are you going?
REGGIE:
I'm gonna look for a map to New Orleans.
What do you think I'm doing?
SULARI:
The kid broke jail. The lawyer's missing.
Gronke spent all night in a freezer.
No one has been killed and the body has not been moved.
Can you explain this to me,
Barry "The Blade"?
Well, the thing is, Uncle Johnny...
...I hid the body under a boat in Romey's boathouse.
You what?
I wanted Romey to remember how close he was to being dead. It was kind of a joke.
Very funny.
After Romey died, there were cops all over the place.
But now they're finally gone,
I can get the body.
The way this has been handled,
Barry, has been very stupid.
I will not let you take this family down with you, do you understand?
I'm begging you, Uncle Johnny, just let me get the body.
Help me now and I promise,
I'll never make another mistake again.
Take Gronke and Bono.
I'm giving you one chance to clear this up.
This is my last favor, Barry.
Thank you, Uncle Johnny.
Barry.
Do you understand what I mean when I say "my last favor"?
I understand.
[PHONE RINGS]
HOOSER [OVER PHONE]:
Reggie Love's office.
REGGIE: Listen, carefully, call Dianne
Sway, tell her Mark's okay. He's with me.
HOOSER: Where are you?
The feds are going crazy.
A motel outside New Orleans.
I gotta go, we'll be back tomorrow.
HOOSER:
You gotta tell me--
REGGIE: Clint, if anything happens, take care of Momma Love for me, okay?
HOOSER: Reggie,
Reggie, don't you hang up. Reggie.
Got something.
Good. Good work.
Hot damn. We monitored a call from Clint
Von Hooser to Dianne Sway at the hospital.
Love has got the kid in New Orleans.
- We're out of here.
- Get the airplane.
- Excellent news.
- Yes, sir.
We are out of here, huh?
We'll give you a telephone call.
Move out, Walter.
Wally.
Are we still going north?
I don't know. Check my compass.
- Take it off.
- No, I never take it off.
That's okay, we're on the right street.
Turn your lights off.
This is where the rich people live.
Holy shit, look at that one.
REGGIE:
Don't curse.
- Shine it over there, see what that one is.
REGGIE:
This must be 1214.
- There it is. Bingo.
- Bingo.
REGGIE:
Oh, my.
Be quiet. Don't let the neighbors see you.
I see a big house, but I don't see a boathouse.
Maybe it's further back.
Get down, you're gonna kill yourself.
We'll find another way.
We can go by the river and hide the car.
MARK:
Okay.
MAN:
Why don't you turn off that television?
- I'm sick of it.
WOMAN: I wanted that cabinet.
REGGIE:
Don't touch the fence.
I ain't crazy.
I don't want the shit shocked out of me.
REGGIE:
Shh. Shh.
That must be Romey's place over there by those trees.
MARK:
Yeah.
- That looks like a boathouse.
- Yeah, but how we gonna get there?
- Come on.
- No, Mark. Shoot.
That's private property.
WOMAN:
Turn off the lights and come to bed.
MAN:
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
MARK:
Romey's neighbors sure are paranoid.
REGGIE: You would be too with the Mafia living next door.
Don't touch it.
- Damn it.
- Shh.
I'll look around here for another door.
There's another door but it's locked too.
Be quiet. Careful.
MARK:
I'll try the window.
MULDANO:
Know how to get to Romey's?
GRONKE: Yeah, everybody knows how to get to Romey's, the smell.
Be careful.
MARK:
Yeah, okay.
REGGIE:
Can you see anything?
Yeah.
Shh.
Quiet.
You'll wake up the neighbors.
- What do you see?
MARK: It's definitely a boathouse.
Wait a minute, what are you doing?
Don't go in.
MARK: I'll climb in and unlock the door from the inside.
REGGIE:
Mark, you listen to me. Get down here.
REGGIE: Mark?
MARK: Unh.
Mark? Shit.
- Are you all right?
- Gotta see if the body's here.
REGGIE:
No, just let me in.
- It's here.
- Will you open up this door? Come on.
REGGIE: Mark, I'm gonna kill you if you don't open this door.
[RACCOON CHATTERS]
[MARK GASPS]
What happened? Are you all right?
Yeah, it's just a raccoon.
Oh, good. Well, now let me in.
MULDANO: Watch the water. If anyone comes--
BONO: I know how to keep lookout.
Just take care of business.
There's somebody coming.
I think it's Barry Muldano.
- Open this door.
MARK: It's locked.
I'm trapped.
GRONKE:
Got a key?
[SILENCED GUNSHOT]
- You hear something?
- No.
[DOOR CLOSES]
- Getting paranoid in your old age, Barry?
- Shut up, asshole.
Bye-bye, Rocky Raccoon.
Leave a goddamn calling card, why don't you?
MULDANO:
I told you I heard something, asshole.
GRONKE: You buried him here?
MULDANO: Yeah, under the boat.
Give me one of those picks.
GRONKE:
Rocket scientist you are.
There are so many neighbors around here.
MULDANO: Will you shut up and start digging?
GRONKE: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
MULDANO:
Come on, let's move him out of here.
Resurrection time, you old bastard.
[MOUTHS]
They found the body.
[MOUTHS]
Get out of there. Come on, right now.
GRONKE:
Let's just get out of here.
Shh, shh.
Hey!
[BOTH GRUNTING]
[REGGIE GRUNTS]
BONO: You okay?
- Get this thing off of me.
[MULDANO SHOUTS]
[ALL GRUNT]
REGGIE:
Run, Mark, run!
[BOTH GRUNTING]
You gonna die, bitch.
Get off her. Now.
I'm serious. Let her go.
Unh.
Drop the knife.
Mr. Mark Sway.
You a big man?
You a big man with a gun, Mark Sway?
You're not gonna shoot anyone.
[GUN COCKS]
Yes, I am.
- Mark, give me the gun. Come on.
- No.
He was gonna kill you.
He was gonna kill me, and he would've killed my mom and my little brother.
You're just a scared little prick.
Probably piss your pants.
- Come on, big man, pull the trigger.
- No, Mark. Mark.
If I just shoot...
...everything will be okay.
No, it won't you'll be just like him.
Please, come on.
Give it to me.
Mark, give it to me.
Give it to me.
You should've let the kid shoot, bitch.
You haven't got the balls.
Really?
[ALARM WAILING]
Jesus Christ.
You robbing son of a bitch!
- Damn!
MAN: Who the hell are you?
No one's breaking into my place, you son of a bitch.
Goddamn it! I'm unarmed!
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Get in the house!
MAN:
Call the police.
MULDANO: What are you, nuts?
GRONKE: We still got time.
MULDANO: Oh, yeah, huh?
GRONKE: Goddamn it.
BONO: Cops gonna be here in a minute.
Get in the boat.
MULDANO:
Damn it!
You're a genius.
You're not bad yourself. Let's see what we got before police get here.
I wonder if he's home.
[MARK GRUNTS]
[REGGIE GASPS]
- Oh, God, he's home.
- Mm-hm.
What's the cloak-and-dagger all about?
You know you can trust us.
- You three come here alone?
- Uh-huh.
- That the truth?
- Of course it is.
Have one of them trot out to those cars that aren't in the parking lot...
...and get a pen from one of those agents that aren't there.
- Get me something to write with.
- Hi.
You've been awful busy, Reggie.
Obstruction of justice, tampering with federal evidence...
...contributing to the delinquency of a minor. You been real busy.
Roy, I am so flattered that you noticed.
You really see Boyd Boyette's body?
- I smelled it too.
- Where is it?
[CHUCKLES]
Here's a list of psychiatric hospitals that specialize in children.
I want a bed for Ricky in one of them by noon.
I don't believe you're in a strong bargaining position.
You know where the body's at, you better tell me.
I know where that body's at now...
...but I don't know where that body's gonna be in three hours.
Now, you wanna keep playing games or you wanna make a deal?
All right.
What do you want?
- You have access to a private jet?
- I do.
Send it to Memphis.
Pick up Dianne and Ricky and their doctor.
We'll meet them at the airport.
When Mark's on board and the plane's in the air...
...I'll tell you where your body is.
How we doing so far?
- I don't hear anything I can't live with.
- Okay.
The family enters the witness-protection program. ..
...soon as Ricky's better, they choose their new city.
Agreed.
Complete change of identification and a nice little house.
White, with a walk-in closet.
Well, write it down. "Walk-in closet."
Is "walk-in" hyphenated?
She's gonna need some starting-out money and a nice new job.
Okay, one of you guys wanna type this up?
Soon as Dianne signs it, we'll live happily ever after.
Give me some help, Reggie.
How far is it to that body?
Twelve little itty-bitty tiny minutes.
[CHUCKLES]
- Thank you, Reggie.
- You're welcome, Roy.
Yeah, they're on the move right now.
Here, give me your bag. Just get right in.
MAN: Sixteen-oh-three hours.
ETA for New Orleans, about 54 minutes.
They screwed up! You shitheads!
You never walk away! Never!
Now, settle down, Barry.
Sometimes you gotta cut your losses to survive.
It's not too late. I can go back,
I can dig up that body myself.
Why don't you let Gronke here drive you?
And take Bono along for company.
You can all go together for a nice long ride.
No, Uncle Johnny, please.
Let me go myself. I can handle it.
And risk getting caught? No.
No more risk, Barry. Barry "The Blade."
No more.
Not ever.
MAN 1: Welcome to New Orleans,
Mrs. Sway. Watch your step.
MAN 2:
They're on the ground.
On the way to the hanger for ground transport.
Mom.
God, I'm sorry I worried you.
- I'm glad you came.
- I'm not sure that I had that much choice.
Mom, if you don't want me to tell them where the body is, I won't.
But they got this great hospital in Phoenix for kids...
...and once Ricky gets better, we can move anywhere we want.
Canada, Connecticut, anywhere.
Anyplace that starts with a C anyway.
They-- They told me we'd have a real house.
And some getting-started money.
Walk-in closet.
[SIGHS]
- And later maybe a good job?
- Yeah.
Can watch my boys grow up.
Maybe even join the PTA.
[DIANNE AND MARK CHUCKLE]
Whatever.
Um. ...
Hell, I'm only 27 years old.
You're due for a break.
Look, about what all I said in the hospital--
- Oh, no.
DIANNE: I wanna apologize.
No need. No need.
And wherever your kids are...
...they're crazy not to want you with them.
Thank you.
You know, like you said, one day at a time.
Phoenix.
I sure do like the sound of that.
[SNAPS FINGERS]
Congratulations, Miss Sway. Jason
McThune will escort you to Phoenix. ..
- ...take care of matters once you arrive.
McTHUNE: Right this way, Miss Sway.
- All right, guys, let's go.
MAN: Yes, sir.
McTHUNE: Come on.
- Let's go, boy. Come on.
Thanks, Reverend Roy.
You've been a real pain in the ass.
Thank you, son, and good luck to you.
I assure you, you have been an even larger pain in the ass.
Give me five. All right.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You can't come with us, can you?
When you enter the witness-protection program, you have to sever all ties.
I'll never see you again, will I?
No.
Look, you wanna...?
You wanna take care of my compass, for me, heh?
That way, you'll never lose your way again.
I love you, Reggie.
I know, sweet boy, I love you too.
You better go with your mama.
Okay?
I'll call you.
[CHUCKLES]
Oh.
The body is behind Romey Clifford's house, in his boathouse.
1214 East Brookline.
Oh, my.
You did very well, Ms. Love.
Reggie. Thank you, Roy.
Oh, you forgot one thing.
You should have demanded immunity for your illegal actions.
Tsk.
Oh, an eye for an eye.
Exodus, 21:24.
Let me tell you something, when I get to be governor of Louisiana, do you want a job?
[CHUCKLES]
- I got one, thank you.
MAN: Showtime, Roy.
Mm.
Thank you, Reggie.
Thank Mark.
Hey.
Y'all come over here and gather round, if you will, please.
REPORTER 1: Come on, come on, come on.
- We have a--
After what I must say has been an exhaustive investigation on our part...
...we are able to make the solemn announcement...
...that we have recovered the body of Senator Boyd Boyette.
HOOSER:
He's quite a kid.
REGGIE: Don't tell him he's a kid, he'll just get real pissed off.
[HOOSER CHUCKLES]
[English - US - SDH]
- Here we go, Nick.
- All right.
- Good morning, Detective.
- I want a shot of the two detectives.
Keep it back, folks.
- Howdy.
- Morning.
Up there.
- How's it going, Gus?
- Morning, Pete.
- Who was this fucking guy?
- Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.
- Never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.
- Hey, Ronny, where they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.
Mid '60s, had five or six hits. 
Got a club down on Fillmore now.
Not now, he don't.
- Do we have a time of death? 
- Almost. 
- Do you guys know Captain Tallcott?
- Sure.
- What's the Chief's office doing here?
- Observing.
- What's it say, Doc?
- Ninety-two degrees. About six hours.
Puts time of death at around 2:00 a.m.
Can somebody close the drapes over there?
Maid came in about an hour ago and found the body.
- She's not a live-in.
- Maybe the maid did it.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
- No bruises on the body.
- It ain't the maid.
Never know.
Sorry.
He was last seen leaving the club with his girlfriend about midnight.
- What was it?
- Ice pick. Left it in the living room.
There's come stains all over the sheets.
- Very impressive.
- He got off before he got off.
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.
Mr. Boz was a major contributor to the mayor's campaign.
He was chairman of the board of the Palace of Fine Arts.
I thought he was a rock and roll star.
He was a retired rock and roll star.
A civic-minded, very respectable rock and roll star.
Then, what's that over there?
Looks like civic-minded, very respectable cocaine.
Listen to me, Curran. 
I'm gonna get a lot of heat on this.
I don't want any mistakes.
What's Boz's girl friend's name?
"Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero."
- Always a pleasure, Captain.
- He's up bright and early.
He doesn't usually punch in 
'til after his 18 holes.
Johnny and the mayor must have been very tight.
Nick, keep your 3:00.
You want me to work the case...
- I said, keep it!
- All right.
I'll keep it.
Good morning. I'm Detective Curran. 
This is Detective Moran.
San Francisco Police Department. 
I'd like to speak to Catherine Tramell.
Come in.
Sit, please. Just a moment.
Ain't that cute? 
They got his and hers Picasso's.
- I didn't know you knew a Picasso.
- Sure I do. It says right here.
Hers is bigger.
Sorry to bother you. 
We just got a couple of questions.
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.
What do you want?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Is he dead?
Why do you think he's dead?
Well, you wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Were you with him last night?
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxy.
I'm her friend.
Well, Roxy, do you know where your friend is?
She's out at the beach house at Stenson. 
Seadrift 1402.
Thanks.
You're wasting your time.
Catherine didn't kill him.
Miss Tramell?
Good afternoon. I'm Detective Curran. 
This is Detective Moran.
- We're with the San Francisco Police...
- I know who you are.
So, how did he die?
He was murdered.
Obviously.
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.
How long were you dating him?
I wasn't dating him. 
I was fucking him.
What are you, a pro?
No, I'm an amateur.
How long were you having sex with him?
About a year and a half.
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.
Did you leave the club with him?
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?
No. We had a drink at the club. 
We left together.
He went home, and I came out here.
Was there anyone with you last night?
No. I wasn't in the mood last night.
Let me ask you something, Miss Tramell.
Are you sorry he's dead?
Yeah.
I liked fucking him.
Look, I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown, if you want.
So read me my rights and arrest me... and then I'll go downtown.
Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.
Please.
Nice girl.
I'm sorry, Beth. 
I got hung up in Stenson.
- How are you, Nick?
- I'm fine.
Come on, Beth. You know I'm fine.
How long do we have to keep doing this?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, 
I suppose.
- Have a seat.
- It's bullshit. You know it is.
I know it is. But sit down, anyway, so we can get it over with, okay?
So, how are things?
Things are fine.
I told you, all right? 
Things are fine.
How is your personal life?
My sex life is fine.
My sex life is actually pretty shitty since I stopped seeing you.
I started developing calluses.
Sorry.
How's the booze?
Haven't had a drink in three months.
- What about the coke?
- No.
No. I'm working my ass off. 
I'm off the sauce.
I even stopped smoking.
How is not smoking?
It sucks.
Now, will you tell I.A. 
I'm just your average... healthy, totally fucked up cop... and let me out of here, please?
Yes.
Thank you.
I still miss you, Nick.
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
Tallcott's in there. They're waiting. 
How did it go?
She misses me.
Boy, when that girl mates, it's for life.
All right, let's start. 
Harrigan.
Well, we got 31 stab wounds, neck and the chest.
No usable prints, no forceable entry, nothing missing.
No prints on the ice pick, either. 
You can pick it up at any K-Mart.
The scarf was Hermes. 
It's expensive.
They sell about 20,000 a year, worldwide.
Bottle was cocaine. High quality, high content. 
He inhaled it.
There were minute quantities on his lips and penis.
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million.
No direct survivors. 
No criminal record.
He liked his drugs. He liked his girls. 
He liked his rock and roll.
He liked the mayor too, right?
What about his girlfriend?
- Is she relevant here? Is she a suspect?
- She's a suspect.
On what basis?
"Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell. Age 30. 
No priors. No convictions.
Magna cum laude at Berkeley, 1983.
Double major: Literature and psychology.
Daughter, sole survivor, 
Marvin and Elaine Tramell... killed in a boating accident, 1979.
Catherine Tramell, sole heir. 
Estimated assets: $110 million."
You're shitting me.
"Formerly engaged to Manuel Vasquez, deceased."
Whoa, whoa! Manny Vasquez?
Former middleweight contender. 
Killed in the ring, Atlantic City, 1984.
I love it. She's got 100 million bucks.
She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars... and she's got a degree in screwing with people's heads.
You forgot about her degree in literature. 
She's a writer.
She published a novel under a pen name. 
Want to know what it's about?
It's about a retired rock and roll star who gets murdered by his girlfriend.
Page 67, cowboy.
You know how she does the boyfriend?
With an ice pick, in bed... his hands tied with a white silk scarf.
Dr. Garner.
I've asked Dr. Lamont to consult with us. 
This isn't really my turf.
Dr. Lamont teaches the pathology of psychopathic behavior at Stanford... and also on the Justice Department 
Psychological Profile Team.
Dr. Lamont.
I see two possibilities.
One: The person who wrote this book is your murderer... and acted out the killing described in ritualistic, literal detail.
Two: Someone who wants to harm the writer... read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate her.
What if the writer did it? 
Then what are we dealing with?
You're dealing with a devious, diabolical mind.
You see, this book had to have been written at least six months... maybe even years... before it was published... which means the writer must have planned the crime in the subconscious back then.
Now, the fact that she carried it out... indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior... in terms not only of the killing itself... but also in terms of the applied advance defense mechanism.
Sometimes I can't tell shit from shinola, Doc.
What was all that you just said?
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.
She's going to say, "Do you think 
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone... in the exact way I described in my book?"
I wouldn't do that because I know I'd be the suspect.
So, what if it's not the writer? 
What if it's someone who read the book?
You're dealing, then, with someone so obsessed... that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim... in order to place the blame on the person who wrote that book.
I'm talking about a deep-seated obsessional hatred... and an utter lack of respect for human life.
So, we got a once in a lifetime, top of the line looney-tuney.
That's what you're saying, right, Doc?
You're dealing with someone very dangerous... and very ill.
You know there's no case here. 
You've got no physical evidence.
She hasn't got an alibi.
She hasn't got a motive, either. 
Believe me... her defense would just beat us to death with this copycat thing.
Anybody who read the book could have done it.
- What do you want to do now? Nothing?
- We call her in for questioning.
She's got enough money to burn the department down...
She was the last person seen with the guy.
I'll take the responsibility.
It's yours.
It won't do any good.
She'll just waltz in with some superstar lawyer... who'll get us all canned for wasting the taxpayers' money.
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No, she won't.
I don't think she'll hide behind anybody.
I don't think she's gonna hide at all.
Then she's as crazy as you are, Curran.
You know what they say:
Takes one to know one.
Miss Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown to answer a few questions.
Are you arresting me?
If that's the way you want to play it.
Could I change into something more appropriate?
It'll only take a minute. 
Come on in.
Make yourselves comfortable. 
I'll be right back.
- Hey, Gus. 
- Hmm?
- So, how long is this gonna take?
- I don't know.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Only when they make interesting reading.
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.
Why would I need an attorney?
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
- I quit.
- Congratulations.
I thought you didn't have any cigarettes.
Oh, I found some in my pocket. 
Would you like one?
I told you, I quit.
It won't last.
- You working on another book?
- Yes, I am.
It must really be something making stuff up all the time.
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.
How's that?
You make up believable stuff. 
It's called suspension of disbelief.
I like that! 
Suspension of disbelief.
What's your new book about?
A detective. 
He falls for the wrong woman.
What happens?
She kills him.
I'm John Carreli, Miss Tramell, assistant district attorney.
I have to inform you this session's being taped.
- This is Captain Tallcott.
- My pleasure.
- And Lieutenant Walker.
- Hi.
- Can we get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.
Are your attorneys going to join us?
Miss Tramell has waived her rights to an attorney.
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
Why have you waived your right to an attorney, Miss Tramell?
Why did you think I wouldn't want one?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
I have nothing to hide.
There's no smoking in this building.
What are you gonna do? 
Charge me with smoking?
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.
I liked having sex with him.
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.
I like men like that.
Men who give me pleasure.
He gave me a lot of pleasure.
You ever engage in any sadomasochistic activity?
Exactly what did you have in mind, Mr. Carreli?
- You ever tie him up?
- No.
You never tied him up?
No.
Johnny liked to use his hands too much.
I like hands and fingers.
You describe a white silk scarf in your book.
I've always had a fondness for white silk scarves.
They're good for all occasions.
But you said you liked men to use their hands, didn't you?
No, I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.
I don't make any rules, Nick. 
I go with the flow.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Miss Tramell?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about killing... and then kill somebody the way I described it in my book.
I'd be announcing myself as the killer. 
I'm not stupid.
We know you're not stupid.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Writing the book gives you an alibi.
Yes, it does.
The answer's no. I didn't kill him.
- Do you use drugs, Miss Tramell?
- Sometimes.
- Did you ever use drugs with Mr. Boz?
- Sure.
What kind of drugs?
Cocaine.
Have you ever fucked on cocaine, Nick?
It's nice.
You like playing games, don't you?
I have a degree in psychology. 
It goes with the turf.
Games are fun.
What about boxing? That's a game. 
Is that fun too?
I don't think that's relevant to this inquiry.
Boxing was fun 'til Manny died.
How did you feel when he died?
I loved him. It hurt.
How did you feel when I told you 
Johnny Boz had died?
I felt like someone had read my book and was playing a game.
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.
- Because you didn't love him?
- That's right.
Even though you were fucking him?
You still get the pleasure.
Didn't you ever fuck anybody else when you were married, Nick?
How'd you know he was married?
Maybe I was just guessing.
What difference does it make?
Would you like a cigarette, Nick?
- Do you two know each other?
- No.
How did you meet Mr. Boz?
I wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock and roll star.
I went down to his club, I picked him up and I had sex with him.
You didn't feel anything for him? 
You just had sex with him for your book?
In the beginning. 
Then I got to like what he did for me.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
I'm a writer. 
I use people for what I write.
Let the world beware.
Do you want me to take a lie detector test?
Wait here, please.
No blips, no blood pressure variations, no pulse variance.
Either she's telling the truth, or I've never seen anyone like her.
I guess that settles it.
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can't fool the machine.
Trust me. It can be done.
And what makes you such an expert?
Because I know people that have done it.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming in, Miss Tramell. 
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Could someone give me a ride home?
Sure.
Thank you.
Want to get a drink?
- Rough day?
- Not really.
Beating that machine can't be easy.
If I was guilty and wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be hard.
It wouldn't be hard at all.
You took a lie detector test after you shot those two people, didn't you?
I passed.
You see? 
We're both innocent, Nick.
You seem to know an awful lot about me.
You know an awful lot about me.
I don't know anything that's not police business.
You know I don't wear any underwear. 
Don't you, Nick?
Thanks for the ride.
Would you like another glass of wine?
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.
What's all this "Nick" stuff?
"Nick, do you want a cigarette? 
Nick, can I have a ride?"
She didn't ask me to give her a ride. 
She asked anybody.
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?
No, Chuckie. 
Get me a double blackjack on the rocks, please.
What you doing, Hoss?
I haven't had a drink in three months.
All right with you, cowboy?
- She doesn't know me, okay?
- Here you go.
I never seen her before Gus and I talked with her.
- Thanks, Chuck.
- You're sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Cheers.
Now what?
What "now what"? 
Now nothing.
She passed the polygraph. 
That's it.
She knew how to beat it, that's why she took it.
How in the fuck do you know? 
What is it with you and this broad?
Come on, Phil. 
Don't let this one slide.
What about her parents? 
What about what else she published?
Maybe all her books come true.
Her parents died in an accident. 
I don't care what else she published.
What are you, a book critic?
How'd they die? 
Was there an investigation?
You're saying she killed her parents? 
Did she kill Manny Vasquez too?
Not unless she climbed into the ring and turned into one mean son of a bitch.
Maybe she did. 
Maybe she grew herself an afro... developed a hell of a left hook and put shoe polish all over her face.
- Let's polygraph her again.
- Fuck you.
Fuck you too.
Don't worry, Phil. 
Nick'll fuck himself.
You guys are very funny. 
Hey, Chuckie, get me another double.
Hey, shooter!
Are you back on the blackjack, shooter?
- We're discussing a case here.
- I know that. I have no doubts.
Here you go, Nick.
A double, huh, shooter?
I'm off duty, Nilsen.
You hear me? 
I'm off duty discussing a case.
Now, I.A. shouldn't have a problem with that.
Maybe I should put in for some overtime?
Don't work too hard, shooter. 
It might drive you to drink.
Stop riding me, man! 
I'll kick your fucking teeth in!
- What's the problem?
- No problem, Doctor.
Here comes the shrink, just in time to save her favorite patient.
Just fuck off, Marty!
You kids have a good time tonight, huh?
- He's asking for it.
- That's right, so don't take the bait.
Do you want to go?
- Yes.
- Let's go.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get Internal Affairs off him.
He ain't that way. 
He's got a heart.
What was she like?
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.
You had her pegged. 
She used her book as an alibi.
I met her at Berkeley.
We were in some of the same classes.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm telling you.
You've never been like that before. Why?
You tell me. 
You're the shrink.
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?
You weren't making love.
I need a cigarette.
I thought you said you quit.
It's the top drawer in the foyer.
Get it on your way out!
- Have you started?
- Waitin' on you.
- You look like dog shit.
- No, he looks a little shrunk is all.
And not just in the head.
All right, I made a couple of calls to Berkeley.
There was a murder in '80. 
A professor.
In his bed, multiple stab wounds, with an ice pick.
Tramell was there then, wasn't she?
University records say she was.
Okay, let's move on this. 
Gus, get out to Berkeley.
Harrigan, find out what else she's published.
Andrews, get me that file on the parents' accident.
Copy Beth on everything. 
I want psychological input.
- What about me?
- You're already getting input.
You go soak your head in a tub of ice water.
You see where she leads.
You have a good weekend.
You too.
Drive carefully.
- I will.
- Bye-bye.
I'll call you.
Ain't you got nothing better to do than to jack off the damn machine?
What are you doing here, cowboy?
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.
One dead psychology professor.
Dr. Noah Goldstein. 
And guess what?
He was her counselor.
Was she a suspect?
No, sir. 
They never even got a statement from her.
Hazel Dobkins?
Do you know her?
Couldn't get it out of my head for years.
Nice little housewife. 
Three little kids.
Nice husband wasn't porking around. 
No financial problems.
One day, out of the clear blue sky, she does them, all of them.
Used a knife she got for a wedding present.
Didn't even deny it. 
Sweet as honey.
Said she didn't know why she'd done it.
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?
No, come on in.
Let's go upstairs.
I'm using you for my detective in my book.
You don't mind, do you?
I was just gonna make myself a drink.
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.
Oh, right. 
You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you?
I've got a few more questions to ask you.
I have some for you too. 
For my book.
Do you have something against ice cubes?
I like rough edges.
So, what did you want to ask me?
How does it feel to kill someone?
You tell me.
I don't know, but you do.
It was an accident.
They got in the line of fire.
Four shootings in five years, all accidents?
They were drug buys. 
I was working undercover.
You want to tell me about Professor Goldstein?
Well, there's a name from the past.
You want a name from the present? 
What about Hazel Dobkins?
Noah Goldstein was my counselor, my fresh man year. 
That's probably where I got the idea for the ice pick for my book.
Funny how the subconscious works.
Hilarious.
- Hazel's my friend.
- Your friend took out her whole family.
Yes, she helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I thought you would have learned that at school.
Only in theory.
But you know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?
Not in theory, in practice.
What happened? 
Did you get sucked into it?
Did you like it too much?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Tell me about the coke, Nick.
The day you shot those two tourists... how much coke did you do?
Come on, you can tell me.
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
They never tested you, did they?
Internal Affairs knew.
Your wife knew too, didn't she?
She knew what was going on.
I think you got too close to the flame.
I think you liked it.
That's why she killed herself.
Hi, hon.
You two have met, haven't you?
You're gonna make a terrific character, Nick.
She's on the phone. 
She'll be right with you.
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Detective, you can't go in...
- Who's got access to my file?
- What are you talking about?
Who has access to my goddamn file?
Nobody. It's a confidential psychiatric record. 
It would be illegal.
Don't you fucking lie to me!
It was Internal Affairs, wasn't it?
No, please.
- Who?
- It's Nilson.
What do you want, Curran?
You sold her my file, didn't you?
Who are you talking about?
Catherine Tramell. 
How much did she pay you?
Hey, Curran, come on! 
Damn it, stop it!
How much?
Hey, back off! 
Back off, Curran!
Nice and easy now. 
Nice and easy.
You fucked yourself, shooter. 
You hear me? You are out!
- Curran, take it easy.
- You are out!
Save it, save it.
- What's going down, Hoss?
- Nothing. I'll be okay.
- They're gonna want your badge.
- I'm tired of being played with.
You got a real conclusive way of demonstrating that.
She knows where I live and breathe.
She's coming after me, Gus.
What is it you got between you?
- I don't know.
- Something, though.
Something.
Nick, are you there?
Go away, Beth. 
I don't want to see you.
I still have my key.
Put them on the table and leave.
Put them on the goddamn table and leave!
Damn it! Don't shove me out! 
You owe me more than that!
I don't owe you anything!
And you don't owe me anything.
We went to bed, what, 10, 15 times?
It wasn't memorable enough to carry an obligation.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Why don't you get yourself some friendly little therapist... to work out some of that hostility?
And maybe you can get off once in a while.
Are you nuts?
I'm sorry.
I don't usually act like that.
How could you give him my file?
I had to!
He was going to recommend your discharge from the force.
He didn't buy my evaluation. 
He said I wasn't objective.
So I made a deal with him to review the session notes himself.
I didn't think he'd show them to anybody.
- You did it for me?
- Yes.
I care about you. I did it for you.
Go away. Please, just go away.
I'm on my way.
One shot. Close range. 
Probably a .38 caliber revolver.
Give me your gun, Nick.
You think that...
I don't, Hoss. 
But I got the minority opinion.
Okay, I went after him! 
I lost my temper.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
We'll speak with you afterwards, Dr. Garner.
- I'd like to sit in.
- I'd really rather wait...
It's all right if Dr. Garner sits in, if Detective Curran doesn't object.
- Where were you last night?
- Home, watching TV.
All night?
Yes, all night.
Were you drinking?
Yeah, I was drinking.
- When did you start drinking again?
- A couple of days ago.
I saw Detective Curran at his apartment about 10:00 last night.
He was sober and lucid.
I asked him, in my capacity as his departmental therapist... about his altercation with Lieutenant Nilsen.
He expressed regret and displayed no hostility.
- How long were you at his apartment?
- About 15 minutes.
I saw there was no reason for my concern and left.
There's no smoking in this building, Detective.
What are you gonna do? 
Charge me with smoking?
Oh, for Christ's... All right, Nick, 
I'm gonna ask you this just once.
For the record, did you kill Marty Nilsen?
No.
I'm gonna storm into his office in front of everybody... in the middle of the day and kill him that night?
I'm not that dumb.
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him. That's your alibi.
Like writing a book about killing a guy gets you off the hook for killing him.
Good point.
What are you talking about?
- A private joke, asshole.
- I don't think it's funny.
You're going on leave... pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation.
I'll get my stuff in a minute.
Thank you.
It's the least I could do.
Considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
No, I mean it. 
Thank you.
How do you know 
Catherine Tramell saw your file?
She knows things about me that I only told you.
She must really be something.
From a clinical point of view.
- What was she like in school?
- I hardly knew her.
She gave me the creeps.
I don't know why.
Get some rest. 
Promise?
- I didn't mean what I said about...
- Yes, you did.
I'm a big girl. 
I can handle it.
- You take care of yourself.
- What'd you find out about the parents?
No lead, man.
You're on psycho leave. 
I'm talking to a possible wacko!
You know I'm wacko. 
What'd you find out?
The boat blew. 
There was a leak in the fuel line.
There were two previous repairs and a five mil policy on both of them.
A real heavy investigation but they got zilch.
Big goose egg. 
It was an "accident."
I.A.'s gonna talk to you about Nilsen. 
They're handling the investigation.
Stay in touch with Dr. Garner. 
It'll help on the evaluation.
She killed him.
Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
Catherine Tramell. 
It's part of her game.
First you got her stealing your file, now she's killing Nilsen?
Forget about her! 
Go somewhere, sit in the sun.
- Get her the hell out of your system!
- You don't buy it, do you?
She knew nobody'd buy it.
She knew I'd say she did it and nobody'd buy it!
She is screwing with your head! 
Stay away from her!
I heard what happened.
What good's a shooter without his gun?
- How exactly did you find out?
- I have attorneys.
They have friends. I have friends.
Money buys a lot of attorneys and friends.
I wouldn't know about that. 
I don't have any money...
I don't have any attorneys, and Gus is my only real friend.
I wasn't talking about real friends.
Why doesn't Gus like me?
I like you.
- You do?
- Yes.
You want to go upstairs and have a drink?
I didn't think you'd ask me.
I guess you don't know your character that well.
Maybe, but I'm learning.
Pretty soon I'll know you better than you know yourself.
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?
You should put some warmth into the place.
You don't want it to reflect your personality.
I'm not trying to fool anybody.
Jack Daniels all right? 
It's going to have to be.
- Ice?
- Great.
I was expecting you.
K-Mart. 
A buck, sixty-five.
Why don't you let me do this for you.
You like watching me do it, don't you?
Could I have a cigarette too, please?
I told you you'd start smoking again.
Would you light it for me?
Thanks.
So how much did you pay Nilsen for my file?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, shooter?
What if I ask you not to call me "shooter"?
Okay. How about if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me Nicky.
Yeah, I know. 
I like it.
Cheers. 
My friends call me Catherine.
What did Manny Vasquez call you?
Bitch, mostly.
But he meant it affectionately.
Do you have any coke?
I just love coke with Jack Daniels.
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.
It's not really the same thing now, is it?
No, it's not.
So where's this going?
What do you want from me?
Say, "what do you want from me, Catherine?"
What the fuck do you want from me, Catherine?
Brought you something.
Aren't you going to say thank-you?
- What's it about?
- It's about a boy who kills his parents.
They have a play, and he makes it look like an accident.
Why did he do that?
To see if he could get away with it.
When did you write this?
You mean, did I write it before my parents died?
No. I wrote it years afterwards.
You wont stop following me around now just because you're on leave?
Absolutely not.
Good, I'd miss you.
You could get in trouble. 
You're not really a cop anymore.
- I'll risk it.
- Why take the risk?
To see if I can get away with it.
- How's your new book?
- Practically writing itself.
I'll be leaving about midnight, in case you are going to follow me.
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.
- I'll meet you there.
Hi, Gus.
Forgive me for asking, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious... but why've you got your head so far up your own ass?
She wants to play. 
Fine, I can play.
Everybody she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.
If you don't leave her alone, 
I'll kill you.
Let me ask you something, "Rocky."
Man to man.
I think she's the fuck of the century.
What do you think?
How long you been here?
You like watching, don't you?
She likes me to watch.
Oh, God.
The beach C
Good morning.
I guess Roxy's not taking this too well.
She's seen me fuck plenty of guys.
Well, maybe she saw something she's never seen before.
She's seen everything before.
Honey, I thought I'd seen everything before.
Did you really think it was so special?
I told her I thought it was the fuck of the century.
What do you think?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
What about Roxy?
Is she more fun?
Would you like her to join us sometime?
- Did she join you and Johnny?
- No, he felt intimidated.
Look what happened to him.
Tell me, were you frightened last night?
That's the point, wasn't it?
That's what made it so good.
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.
You're in over your head.
Maybe, but this is how I'll catch my killer.
I'm not going to confess all my secrets just because I have an orgasm.
You won't learn anything 
I don't want you to know.
Yes, I will. 
Then I'll nail you.
You'll just fall in love with me.
I'm in love with you already.
But I'll nail you anyway.
You can put that in your book.
No
Not that bar again
Oh, I want to know you're the one
And I don't mean the one I regret
The heart's still going
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Where the fuck you been?
- I've been over to your place.
- Easy, cowboy, easy.
- I wasn't there.
- I went over last night too.
Well, I wasn't there either.
You fucked her.
God damned, dumb son of a bitch!
You fucked her!
God damn! You are one... dumb son of a bitch!
Next time, I'll use a rubber.
I don't give a flying, chili bean fart about that!
- How about it, Harry. How much?
- Thirty-two.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about rubbers.
You really gotta protect yourself.
What in the hell for?
You think I'm getting any? 
Sure, I can get laid by blue haired women!
- I don't like them!
- Don't knock it 'til you tried it!
Feeling better?
I feel fine.
How could you fuck her?
Come on.
You want to die, Hoss?
What is it? 
Those tourists?
You still so bad about that, you're wiggling your way into an ice pick?
Got too many god damn tourists coming here anyway!
- Hold it down.
- Plenty more where they came from!
I'm not afraid of her.
Why the hell not?
I don't know.
I'm just not.
That's her pussy talking! 
It ain't your brain!
Come on.
I.A. did a track on Lieutenant Martin 
D-for-dickhead Nilsen. 
They found a safety deposit box with $50,000 in it... taken out three months ago and not used since.
That doesn't make any sense. 
She didn't know me three months ago.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.
Maybe the money was for something else. 
How the fuck do I know?
I'm just an old city cowboy trying not to fall out of his saddle.
- All right, cowboy?
- Yeah.
Come on. 
I'm going to drive you home.
In that little piss-ant car of yours?
Hell, no. I ain't getting no back pain disability retirement.
I'm gonna get a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
I'm driving you...
You're not driving my Cadillac car!
I won't let no head-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car!
So long!
You wanna play? Come on!
Lieutenant! 
I got the information.
Get it down here!
You signed your name to this crock of shit?
Why not? 
It was an accident.
"Your driving around North Beach and this car won't get out of the way."
I don't think she meant to go off the edge.
- Could we have him for a minute?
- No, you can't!
Don't fuck with me on this. 
I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
Full name is Roxanne Hardy. 
Last known address, Cloverdale, California.
No priors, no convictions.
Car is registered to Catherine Trammel.
- You knew her!
- I met her at Trammel's house.
All I did was write her name down.
You wrote her name down and then big surprise... she rolls her car down a hill and dies.
- Is that what you're telling me?
- That's all I know.
You know what then? Fuck you!
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office...
- I told you to stay away from Trammel!
You didn't tell me to stay away from the car!
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office!
- Who are you selling my file to now?
You are out of control, Curran. 
You hear me?
Hello, Nick. 
This is Dr. Myron... and Dr. McElwaine.
They've been asked to consult with me on this psychiatric evaluation.
Sit down.
We understand you're having difficulty controlling your temper lately.
Only in regard to one person.
Do you think Lieutenant Nilsen deserved to die?
I didn't know him well enough.
I won't miss him.
When you recollect your childhood... are your recollections pleasing to you?
Number one: I don't remember how often 
I jerked off, but it was a lot.
Number two: 
I wasn't pissed off at my dad... even when I was old enough to know what he and mom did in the bedroom.
Number three: 
I don't look in the toilet before I flush.
Number four: 
I haven't wet my bed for a long time.
Number five... why don't the two of you go fuck yourselves.
I'm out of here.
What's your problem? 
I'm trying to help.
- Why won't you let me?
- I don't want your help!
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do!
Something's going on.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
- Why are you interested in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.
She seduces and manipulates people.
- She'll do anything she can...
- I thought you hardly knew her?
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
- That means... you manipulate people too!
You're a practicing psychologist.
You're better at it than she is!
I feel sorry for you!
I should have known.
I came in to the house.
When we were down on the beach... she looked at me so strangely.
She left right after you.
I...
I shouldn't have let her watch us.
She wanted to watch me all the time.
She tried to kill you, didn't she?
- Did you like her to watch you?
- You think I told her to kill you?
No.
Everybody that I care about... dies.
Make love to me.
You think she killed Johnny Boz?
For what, to set me up?
She loved me. 
She wouldn't frame me.
- Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.
- No, she didn't.
She'd never get jealous before.
She got excited.
I don't have luck with women.
There was this girl...
I met when I was in college.
I slept with her once.
She started following me around, taking my picture.
She dyed her hair, copied my clothes.
Lisa... something, Oberman.
It was awful.
I thought you didn't make confessions.
I never did before.
Another nice girl.
How old was she when it happened?
Sixteen.
We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.
That's why you couldn't find it in your computer.
What was the motive?
She said she didn't know. 
Just sort of did it on impulse.
The razor just happened to be there. 
That's what she said.
- Help yourself to some coffee.
- Thanks.
I don't understand what the hell is going on here.
It ain't hard, Hoss. 
This young farm girl... got tired of all that attention going to her little brothers... so she fixed them.
Just like old Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family.
Except young Roxy here, didn't use a wedding present.
She used daddy's razor.
Sure makes you wonder what they talk about... when they sit in front of the campfire at night.
You ever met a friend of hers that hasn't killed somebody?
Must of beat your ordinary, every day girl talk.
I'm not sure, anymore, she did it.
Which one we talking about now?
We know Hazel did it. 
We know young Roxy did it.
And the other one...
She's got that magna cum laude pussy that fried up your brain.
"Oberman, Mark W., Donald M."
Sorry, no "Lisa."
You sure about the year?
Catherine Tramell graduated in '83.
She said Lisa Oberman was here at the same time.
Yeah, we have Tramell.
But no Lisa Oberman.
Are you sure? 
There can't be a mistake?
Only if you're making it, Detective.
Hazel, this is Nick. 
I told you all about him.
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.
You're the shooter, aren't you?
How are you?
Fine, thank you. 
Can I speak to you for a minute?
Would you wait for me in the car? 
I'll be right there.
Good-bye, shooter.
You like to hang out with murderers, or what?
- You know that Roxy was involved...
- Yes, of course, I knew.
I write about unusual people,
 and sometimes when I do my research...
I get involved with them.
It happened with you.
Killing isn't like smoking.
You can quit.
I gotta go.
I promised I'd get her home by 6:00.
She just loves "America's Most Wanted."
There was no Lisa Oberman when you were at Berkeley.
What are you doing? 
Checking up on me?
For what? 
I said "Hoberman."
"Hoberman." Lisa Hoberman, with an H.
You do?
All right. 
Thank you very much.
You know I can get my butt kicked for this.
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- Come on, Sam.
- This is only gonna take a minute.
- Yeah.
Bring it up.
That's Dr. Garner, isn't it?
Bring up '83.
You shouldn't leave your door open.
I didn't. 
There's something wrong with my lock.
What do you want?
Tell me about Catherine.
She told you, didn't she?
What did she tell me?
I slept with her once in school.
I was just a kid. 
I was experimenting.
It was just that one time.
She developed a fixation on me.
She styled her hair like mine, wore the same kind of clothes as I did.
It scared me.
Isn't that what she told you?
She said it was you.
You dressed like her. 
You dyed your hair blonde...
I did dye my hair. 
It had nothing to do with her.
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?
- I had him for two classes.
- You saw all the reports.
Phil copied you. 
You never said anything!
What am I supposed to say?
"I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect"?
I was embarrassed. 
It was the only time I'd been with a woman.
She's really sick, you know.
Do you know what she's doing?
She knows I went to Berkeley. 
She knows I knew Noah.
She makes up this story about me.
She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with her.
She didn't hand you to me. 
She doesn't know who you are.
You told me about a Lisa Hoberman.
She knows you'd find out who Lisa is. 
You're a good cop.
She tell you casually?
Make it seem irrelevant?
Did she tell you in bed?
That's what I'd do.
Why'd you change your name?
I got married. 
He called me "Beth."
He was on staff at the clinic in Salinas.
Didn't last long.
Do you really think that I could kill someone?
I never even met Johnny Boz!
And what about Nilsen? 
What motive would I have to kill him?
- You should get that lock fixed.
- God...
She's evil! She's brilliant!
Did I scare you?
I wanted to surprise you.
- What's wrong?
- I found Lisa Hoberman.
Oh, you did? 
What's she doing?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.
She said you got it backwards.
She said you styled your hair like she did.
And you believed her.
I had to go to the campus police and file a report about her.
- I suppose you still think I kill people too?
- No.
Liar.
- Who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide, San Francisco.
Here we go.
Kind of.
There was a report about Lisa Hoberman, 
January, 1980.
- But it's out of here.
- Who's got it?
One of your guys. Nilsen.
- You know him?
- Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Tell him to bring it back. 
He's had it a whole year.
So Nilsen had a report on Beth. 
You don't know what was in it.
- Catherine told me what was in it.
- If she's telling you the truth.
Gus, don't you get it?
If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine... she wouldn't want anybody to know what happened in Berkeley!
But Nilsen found out about it. 
That gives her the motive to kill him.
How did she know Nilsen found out, if it happened?
He probably asked her!
She'd have to be nuttier than a 20 pound fruitcake!
She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers!
- You're girlfriend is! 
- She's a writer! That's her job!
I don't buy it. There must be somebody at Berkeley who knows what happened!
I know what happened! 
Catherine told me!
- Everything she says has checked out!
- You got tweety birds... fluttering around in your head!
You think you can fuck like minks, raise rug rats... and live happily ever after?
Oh, man!
How'd you get in here?
What's this?
I decided to give you a second chance.
- I missed you.
- I wasn't gone long enough.
Did you miss me?
No.
Why don't you come over here and tell me no.
- I've seen them before.
- Yeah?
Well, you might not see them again.
My book's nearly finished.
My detective's almost dead.
So I've got time for a last cigarette?
Afterwards.
I've got to do some research tomorrow morning.
I'm good at research. 
I'll help you.
No, thanks.
What are you researching?
Oh... a new ending to your book.
Oh, really? 
What's the twist?
The detective falls for the wrong girl.
But he doesn't die.
So what happens to him?
They fuck like minks, raise rug rats... and live happily ever after.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
Somebody always does.
Morning. 
I'm looking for a Dr. Garner.
She doesn't work here anymore. 
She's in San Francisco with the police.
Actually, I'm looking for her husband.
- He works here too, doesn't he?
- Dr. Joseph Garner?
- She married?
- You know him?
He died about five or six years ago.
- How did he die?
- He was shot.
Thank you.
He was walking home from work.
He only lived a couple of blocks from the clinic.
Somebody just drove by and shot him.
- What was the murder weapon?
- Revolver, .38. Unrecovered.
- Watch yourself.
- Were there any suspects?
No suspects, no motive. 
Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
One of your guys was down here from Frisco a year ago.
He was asking the same, exact thing.
You mind telling me what's going on?
Routine.
That's exactly what he said.
Now I got two of you guys telling me it's "routine."
You remember what the other guy's name was?
No. I can't really say that I do.
Nilsen?
Yeah. That was it.
- So was she ever a suspect?
- No.
There was some talk.
But it never panned out.
- What kind of talk?
- Girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
No.
She did.
But like I said, it never panned out.
- Thank you.
- Hope that helped you out.
Yes, you did. You sure did.
I missed you.
I finished my research.
- I finished my book.
- So how does it end?
I told you.
She kills him.
Good-bye, Nick.
Good-bye?
Yeah. I finished my book.
Didn't you hear me?
Your character's dead.
Good-bye.
What do you want, flowers?
I'll send you an autographed copy.
What is this, some kind of joke?
You playing a game here?
The games are over.
You were right.
It was the fuck of the century, shooter.
I'll be right there.
Catherine Tramell's roommate, freshman year? 
I just got a call from her. 
She's in Oakland. Come on!
I've been phoning people from her dorm all day. 
She must've heard I was trying to reach her.
Says she knows all about Catherine and Lisa Hoberman.
You feeling okay?
Here's something else.
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an office on Van Ness.
Guess who he shares space with?
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.
What in the hell's the matter with you?
I'll be in suite 405.
- Where the hell you going?
- I'm going with you.
You're on leave, Hoss.
It ain't gonna take long.
Freeze!
What are you doing here?
Put your fucking hands up!
I got a message to meet Gus here.
- Where is he?
- Don't you move!
I know about your husband! 
You still like girls, Beth?
- What?
- Take you hands out of your pocket!
- Take them out!
- What's wrong with you?
Take them out!
I loved you.
Oh, God!
What made you think she had a gun?
What was she doing here? 
What was Gus doing here?
Lieutenant.
One of ours.
Jesus.
We'll have to check Beth's apartment.
Thirty-eight caliber revolver.
In the bookcase, behind some books.
Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.
Lieutenant. 
You better come in here.
I guess that's it.
Definitely not. We feel all the evidence points to Dr. Elizabeth Garner.
We checked. It's her size.
She probably heard you on the stairway and dumped this stuff.
There's no suite 405.
Catherine Tramell's freshman roommate is dead.
She died of leukemia two years ago.
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- What about Salinas?
Yeah, hold on. Jack!
Did you check Nilsen's office for any files on Beth Garner?
No police report from Berkeley. 
Nothing at all about Salinas.
I'm back.
Great.
Ballistics says the .38 we found in her apartment was used on Nilsen.
No registration. 
They're checking with Salinas.
The ice pick was the same brand and model as the Boz weapon.
Checked the tape machines at Dr. Garner's apartment and office... both here and the one on Van Ness.
There's no message from Gus on any of them.
The tape in her apartment was unused.
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he thinks he remembers...
Dr. Garner and Boz meeting at a Christmas party at his house.
A year ago.
You just can't tell about people, can you?
Even the ones you think you know inside and out.
Congratulations, Curran.
I heard about what happened.
On TV.
I can't allow myself to care about you.
I can't allow myself... to care.
I don't want to do this.
Please. 
I don't want to do this.
I lose everybody.
I don't want to lose you.
What do we do now?
Fuck like minks... raise rug rats and live happily ever after.
I hate rug rats.
Fuck like minks, forget the rug rats... and live happily ever after.
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Why, Smilla?
My baby.
Isaiah!
He was playing on the roof.
He fell.
All right, nothing to see now.
Come on.
I just need a few from this angle.
O.K.
I f-f-found him.
What made him run?
Who are you?
I'm the lady who lived upstairs from him.
He's the gentlemen from the ground floor.
Well, you're not allowed up here.
I'll need the footprints of the deceased.
I don't know why the hell he was playing up here, running around wild without supervision.
A strange way to play, don't you think?
Take these people downstairs.
The tracks go in a straight line towards the edge.
No child in the world would play like that.
Can you just go down now, please?
Why so many accidents,
Smilla?
First my husband, and now my baby.
Why, Smilla?
I don't know.
How am I going to go to the morgue tomorrow?
If they think it's an accident, why are they doing an autopsy?
They told me to show up and... sign papers, and get his things.
I'll go, Juliane.
Let me go.
I had hoped he would live a long life.
Yes. All parents hope that for their children.
I have children of my own.
I know how you must feel.
My deepest condolences.
I'm not his mother.
We were friends.
Beat it, you little shit.
Wanna read me a story?
No, I won't read you a story.
Persistent little bastard, aren't you?
I can't be your little friend. O.K.?
I have nothing to offer you.
Just go away.
Hmm?
Look, there's absolutely no future in this.
"A point is that which cannot be divided.
A line is a length without breadth."
This can't possibly interest you.
Hmm.
"A semicircle is a figure contained within a diameter and the circumference intersected by the diameter."
You smell bad.
I don't mean to say this to hurt your feelings, but you really stink.
What interests you?
Do you know anything about Greenland?
Hmm.
You should know something about where you're from.
Why?
Because it tells you who you are.
It's important to know who we are.
Do you know who you are?
No.
Did your mom read you stories?
She told me stories.
About what?
About Greenland.
When she used to hunt, stories like that.
Miss Smilla, can we go home?
Why, are you tired?
No, home to Greenland.
What do you want me to do, lie to you?
Tell you we'll go to Greenland and then not go?
Get your hopes up?
If Inuits who are feuding wish to reconcile, they touch each other's breasts, and say ilaga.
Ilaga.
Ilaga.
It means friend.
Ilaga.
When a child dies like that, it's a tragedy.
Terrible accident.
It wasn't an accident.
I see.
Who did the autopsy?
It was routine.
That's not what I asked you.
Doctor Loyen.
Johannes Loyen?
Isn't he the head of the Institute of Arctic Medicine?
Mm-hmm.
Why would such a famous man do an autopsy on a 6-year-old?
It was routine.
So you've said.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Do you think his feet were cold?
He always wore those sneakers.
When I saw him lying there in the snow, his soles were so run-down.
His feet must have been cold.
Would you like something to drink?
I may be from Greenland, but I don't drink.
Are you...
Are you hungry?
Look, I don't want to share anything with you. O.K.?
O.K.
Perhaps you can sleep.
Go-G-Good night.
Do you always stutter?
No.
I make you nervous then?
Don't you think I see the way you look at me?
What did you think, we'd get drunk and fuck all night, fueled by our mutual grief?
Is that what you thought?
It's O.K., Smilla.
I loved him, too.
Yeah.
Of course you did.
Dr. Loyen.
You're of Greenlandic descent.
My mother was Greenlandic.
You were the one who examined Isaiah?
Yes.
What I would like to know is what did he die of?
He fell from a height of 5 stories.
The organism as a whole simply collapses.
Was there any trace of violence?
None at all.
What makes you think that?
Is it possible to see the report?
You wouldn't understand it.
Look, both we and the police are interested in the most thorough investigation possible.
In a case like this, if there's even the slightest doubt, we look for everything and we find everything.
A child defends itself, gets skin cells under its nails.
There was nothing like that, nothing at all.
We looked at the police report.
The footprints show quite clearly that the boy was alone on the roof before he fell.
There was nothing to indicate that this was anything but an accident.
It's tragic, of course, but the case is closed.
Now, please drop by again, my dear lady, if there's anything else that troubles you.
I'm filing a complaint with the district attorney.
What makes this your business?
A 6-year-old boy was murdered.
I'm making it my business.
I've told you there's no forensic evidence to indicate foul play, none whatsoever.
I don't really care about your forensic evidence.
I knew him, and that's my evidence.
We all have our phobias.
Do you know what
Isaiah's was?
It was heights.
Nevertheless, he was up there.
Yes, he was.
And what puzzles me... what keeps me awake at night is wondering what made him go up there at all.
May I please spend the night?
Hello!
Hello!
We're going to miss the film.
You're late.
I've called the agency twice.
It's not the baby-sitter, dear.
Come in.
We get 1,000 cases a year.
I can't be expected to remember every single one.
Unburden yourself, Lagermann.
You'll feel better.
We were very busy the night he was brought in: drunk drivers, Christmas parties.
You're not squeamish, are you?
No.
I have a little trick, the kind of thing you invent in any profession.
I hold a light bulb inside his trousers.
In one leg, there is a perforation.
I examine the boy again.
All of this is routine.
I find a hole in his thigh.
There's no bleeding, and the tissue hasn't contracted.
You know what that means?
No.
It means that whatever happened at that spot occurred after his heart had stopped beating.
I take a closer look at his trousers.
There's a little indentation around the hole.
This rings a bell.
So I get out a biopsy needle, a kind of syringe, quite big, attached to a handle.
You plunge it into the tissue to get a sample.
The hole in his trousers was where someone in a hurry shoved it in with a good whack.
Someone had taken a muscle biopsy from him after he died.
The ambulance men?
I talked to the driver and the medics and the orderlies who received the body.
They all swore on a stack of Bibles that they didn't do it.
Why didn't Loyen tell me this?
I was just beginning the autopsy when Loyen arrived.
He was surprised
I'd started on the boy.
He pulled me off it and took over.
What do you think was after him on the roof?
I don't know.
But I won't be much in the Christmas spirit until I find out.
Please don't come here again.
One more thing.
The night he died wasn't the first time
I'd seen him.
He came in once a month.
Loyen examined him... alone.
I don't suppose there are any records.
I've already looked.
Nothing.
Man:
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings, and heavenly places of the Christ...
...the foundation of the world... that we should be holy and without blame before Him.
And love, having predestinated us...
...by Jesus Christ who Himself...
...in praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted... in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace...
Who was that man at the funeral?
What was he trying to give you?
I don't want his money no more.
Dirty money.
What money?
Why does he give you money?
They always try to buy me out.
First my husband, now my kid.
Who's they?
"We wish to inform you that the directors of Greenland Mining have decided to grant you a widow's pension following the death of your husband...
Norsaq Christiansen."
It's signed Elsa Lubing.
Who's she?
Who's Elsa Lubing?
Can I take this?
Oh, yes.
I filmed this as you came back from the hunting trip with your mother.
You'd had bad weather with a lot of fog.
You were lost.
Everyone had given up hope.
Your mother said you suddenly pointed with complete conviction.
You knew the way home.
No one could explain it.
From that day on, they always strapped you to the front of the sledge whenever they went on a hunting trip.
You knew exactly how to get home.
Yeah, Father.
How the hell do you explain that?
I don't know.
I just knew.
You were a regular little Eagle Scout.
A real little
Nanook of the North.
Cut it out, Benja.
You should try Brentan.
What?
Brentan. For fungus between the toes.
It's not fungus.
People don't get that till they reach your age.
Yeah, adolescents do, too.
Especially if you work out a lot.
And it spreads quite easily to the crotch.
What do you know about Johannes Loyen?
He's a... very talented man.
He created the Institute for Arctic Medicine.
What's his interest in forensic medicine?
He started out as a pathologist.
He did an autopsy on a 6-year-old boy.
Ha.
Must have been a good career move.
Since our school days,
Loyen has always wanted to be recognized as the best in the world, not just in Denmark, but in the universe.
It wasn't a flame like in the rest of us.
It was a conflagration.
He wrote this as his thesis for his professorial degree.
"Mesozoan Parasites."
What are they?
Prehistoric worms.
Write me a prescription, Father.
Are you sick, Smilla?
With this piece of paper, you can save my life and keep your hippocratic oath.
It has to be 5 figures.
I let someone down.
A child.
It'll take money to do something about it.
I'm afraid that check won't be nearly enough.
He only gives you money because you make him feel so guilty.
He told me that.
And he only gives you money, Benja, because you're such an amusing little fuck.
But one day, like all of us, you'll wake up and your perfect tits will be starting to sag, and your perfect little piquant ass will be starting to go.
Then what, Benja?
By then, Smilla, you'll be dead, and I won't care.
Come for Christmas dinner?
I don't celebrate Christmas.
It doesn't mean anything to me.
They hunted seals by their igloos.
They stalked them with screens on the ice.
"They waited for them on a floe edge, and they harpooned them from kayaks."
They hunted them in the bluish darkness of the winter night.
To the Inuits, the seal was life.
Isaiah, what did I just say?
Isaiah?
Tell me what I just said.
Tell me.
What did I just say?
My God.
Juliane?
Juliane, Isaiah's gone deaf.
He's gone deaf from having 3 ear infections from you not taking care of him!
Doctors say he was O.K.
What doctors?
Who told you he's O.K.?
He's not O.K.
There's nothing to worry about.
Ilaga.
I'm not mad at you.
Ilaga.
Stop it.
I'm not mad at you.
Ilaga, ilaga.
Yes, you're my friend.
Ilaga, Isaiah.
Please... don't be frightened.
I'm from the district attorney's office.
Do you always make house calls?
Let's just say it's the nature of this case... and because of your thought-provoking letter.
I spoke to Professor Loyen.
He told me that you came in to see him.
There were tracks in the snow.
I read the report and looked at the pictures.
You have to have special lenses and lights or it doesn't show up.
What doesn't show up?
They were acceleration tracks.
When you take off from the snow or ice, a pronation occurs in the ankle joint like when you walk barefoot in the sand.
If the movement is too fast, not firm enough, they'll be a little slip backwards.
As with any child who is playing...
If you're used to playing in the snow, you don't leave that kind of track because the movement is not efficient.
He grew up in Greenland.
He was used to snow.
You don't believe me?
I didn't say that.
The truth is
I've felt uncomfortable about this case from the beginning.
And when you wrote your letter, that confirmed it for me.
There was so little to go on.
What do you want me to do?
Find out what was after him.
I'll do my best.
You have my word.
Thank you.
I don't know your name.
Raven.
I'll be in touch with you.
Thank you, Mr. Raven.
Thank you for believing me.
Hello?
My name is Smilla Jaspersen.
I have some questions about Greenland Mining.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
I don't work there anymore.
Who is it?
Delivery for Elsa Lubing, from the florist.
She isn't home.
Could you buzz me in, please?
We have strict instructions not to open the door for nonresidents.
They're orchids, Mrs. Schou, straight off the plane from Portugal, and they'll die if I leave them out here.
I can see you!
You won't get away with anything.
I remember this letter quite well.
She said she had flowers.
It's all right, Mrs. Schou.
At this time of day,
I'm normally in prayer.
Norsaq Christiansen's death was a tragic accident, especially for the boy.
A child needs both parents... one of the reasons why marriage is sacred.
Mr. Lubing would be pleased to hear that.
There's no Mr. Lubing.
I am the bride of Jesus.
The boy is dead.
4 days ago, he fell off a roof.
I met him once.
When I saw him
I knew why it was written:
"Unless we become as little children, we cannot enter paradise."
I hope his mother finds her way to Jesus.
Only if one can find Him at the bottom of a bottle.
Oh, He is everywhere, even there.
Someone chased the boy off the roof.
He was murdered.
The devil assumes many forms.
It's one of those forms that I'm looking for.
Do you know a Professor Loyen?
No.
Was he on the payroll of Greenland Mining?
I don't remember.
You said that you met Isaiah.
When?
Greenland Mining began to hire Inuits for the geological expeditions, and it was on one of those expeditions in the summer of 1993... on the Gela Alta glacier... that the father died.
When we awarded the pension, the son and his mother came to my office.
How did the father die?
An explosion.
You are interested in the past, Ms. Jaspersen.
I'm interested in why the chief accountant of Greenland Mining has such a guilty conscience that she's writing notes in the margins of pension awards.
May I see the report of that expedition?
They're in the safe in the archive department.
There's nothing to see.
Thou shalt not lie, Ms. Lubing.
I think you should go now.
Why do you think someone was chasing the little boy?
There was snow on the roof that he fell from.
I saw his footprints.
The way you have a sense of God,
I have a sense of snow.
Ms. Jaspersen?
Hello?
Would you come back up for a moment?
Just now when you left,
I opened... it at the Book of Revelations.
"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from Heaven onto the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit."
The key to hell.
Miss Jaspersen, how far will you go?
Try me.
There are 2 archive sections in the basement of our building on Strand Boulevard.
That's where the expedition reports are kept.
Naturally, I cannot mention that there's a passkey system nor that the abloy key on the wall behind you is for the main entrance to the building.
Ms. Lubing: Someone has to guard the gates of hell.
Good doggie.
Ah!
Why were you following me?
I've been thinking about what you said... about the footprints.
If you're right, you're in danger.
You can, um... sit.
Isaiah and I were friends, you know.
He used to make me laugh.
He had this little game where he used to put his head in his hands like this, and when he'd come up, he would be... a monkey or a rabbit or Frankenstein or whatever.
I used to see him, um... come home sometimes in a cab.
I... He always seemed so... so afraid.
They examined him every month at the hospital.
I think that's what scared him.
Why? What do you think they were looking for?
I don't know.
Someone shoved a biopsy needle into him after he died, and a very important doctor...
I do... appreciate it when someone makes me something good.
Thank you.
Don't go.
Isaiah's father was on an expedition for Greenland Mining when he died.
That prick Loyen was the medical consultant.
I saw his name in here.
Try to read it.
It'll be good for your dyslexia.
Smilla.
Why does such a nice person have such a rough mouth?
I'm sorry if I've given you the impression it's my mouth that's rough.
I try to be rough all over.
Miss Jaspersen,
I'd like to talk to you, please.
Talk.
Would you mind coming to the station with us?
I would mind.
I'm sorry, you must.
Keep your hands off me.
I'll come with you, just take your hands off.
Get your hands off me!
You don't have to go if you don't... f- f-feel like it.
Will I be driven home?
To your door.
Can't resist a man with manners.
See you later.
"Smilla Jaspersen, born the 16th of June, 1960, in Quanaaq, Greenland.
Parents:
Ann Qaavigaaq Jaspersen, a local hunter, and Moritz Jaspersen,
American physician.
In 1989, employed by the Geodetic Institute.
From 89-93, scientific participant in expeditions to the ice cap, the Arctic Ocean, and arctic North America."
Various references are attached... all of which state unanimously that if you want to know anything about ice, you would benefit by consulting Smilla Jaspersen.
Captain Telling here, however, has gathered some information of a different character.
Moved to Denmark in 1967 after the death of your mother.
Expelled from 4 boarding schools.
Admitted to Copenhagen University, asked to leave a year later."
Then there are these other references, all of which state that you have created trouble wherever you've been.
Arrested twice.
Once in Canada.
I was tagging polar bears.
Bears don't read maps, so they don't respect national boundaries.
This paints a picture of a woman who has never completed a course of study, who has been unemployed for years, who has no family, who's created conflict wherever she's been: someone who has never been able to fit in.
Anyone with any sense would keep a very low profile in your position.
Is it my clothes you don't like?
What we don't like are your fruitless and damaging attempts to meddle in the investigation of this case which I have already promised you
I would look into.
I remember what you promised to me.
Screw you, Raven.
These belong to Greenland Mining.
We found them in your flat.
Imprisonment in a little soundproof room with no windows is,
I've been told, particularly difficult if you've been brought up in Greenland.
This would cause you extreme distress.
It's true, is it not?
They say it's something about those vast spaces, the horizon.
That what it is?
All that space.
Good.
Then we mustn't let that happen.
We've reached an agreement, then.
Will you say that louder, please, so I can hear you?
Yeah.
We've reached an agreement.
You may go home now.
Smilla, this is your father.
Could you come for lunch tomorrow at the club?
Call me...
Anything is better than suicide?
How can you have
6 spelling mistakes in 5 words?
I'm not suicidal.
Suicide is for cowards.
Sometimes one just wants to be left alone, that's all.
There was an earlier expedition in '66.
There was an accident that time, too.
2 of the 8 men died.
Loyen was on both expeditions.
I can't be part of this.
I came to tell you that.
I'm out of it. Good luck.
Smilla.
W...
What did they d... do to you?
They threatened to lock me up.
And I can't be locked up.
I'm quite ashamed.
Really, I am.
I just can't be locked up.
Don't.
It's O.K.
Do you think I need you to understand me?
God. Sorry.
What is it about you that always makes me want to insult you?
When my father first brought me here from Greenland,
I refused to sleep indoors.
I couldn't stand it: the heat.
I was used to the snow, the air.
I made a tent out on the lawn.
Poor Moritz.
He was so embarrassed.
Even now my idea of hell is to be locked up.
Where...
Where was your mother?
She went out one day to hunt.
They found her kayak a few days later.
The side had been staved in.
No one who falls into the water in Greenland ever comes up again.
The sea is less than
39 degrees Fahrenheit, and at that temperature, all the processes of decomposition stop.
- How old were you?
That's when you came here?
That's when my father brought me here.
But you were never happy here?
The only thing that makes me truly happy is mathematics, snow, ice, numbers.
To me, the number system is like human life.
First you have the natural numbers, the ones that are whole and positive, like the numbers of a small child.
But human consciousness expands, and the child discovers longing.
Do you know the mathematical expression for longing?
Negative numbers.
The formalization of the feeling that you're missing something.
Then the child discovers the in-between spaces between stones, between people, between numbers, and that produces fractions.
But it's like a kind of madness, because it doesn't even stop there.
It never stops. There are numbers that we can't even begin to comprehend.
Mathematics is a vast, open landscape.
You head towards the horizon that is always receding... like Greenland.
And that's... that's what
I can't live without.
Smilla.
That's why I can't be locked up.
Can I kiss you?
Smilla.
It's Christmas Eve.
Toast with me.
To what?
To Isaiah.
Don't you understand?
My heart is broken.
Then to a merry Christmas.
And a happy New Year.
Smilla.
Merry Christmas, Smilla.
Juliane, you look wonderful.
2 days, Smilla. No drink.
Merry Christmas, Smilla.
He hid this box good.
You should keep it now.
Open it.
His Walkman.
You gave it to him last Christmas. Remember?
It was his best present.
They let Isaiah go with them on the expedition?
The Greenland Mining people were looking for men in Greenland.
My husband signed on.
They told us that
Isaiah could go with him, so how dangerous could it be?
They were digging inside a glacier.
Something must have happened.
Isaiah was outside.
They took his dad in a helicopter to the hospital, and there his dad died.
He never saw him again.
What really happened, Juliane?
Be careful, Smilla.
It was not an accident.
There was something in the melt water.
Isaiah told me so.
In the melt water?
How would Isaiah know?
His daddy told him.
But he couldn't have done.
You just said they flew your husband away...
Smilla, please.
...in a helicopter.
Smilla, please.
No more questions.
Who brought Isaiah home?
This doctor. Loyen.
Was Isaiah sick, Juliane?
Is that why Loyen examined him every month?
Smilla, please.
No more questions.
I'm scared.
But I'll do it anyway.
I knew you would.
The Inuit believe that if you kill something, you offend its soul.
I need his soul to be at peace.
Did you ever hear the phrase,
"She was so drunk that she didn't know what she was doing"?
That's why I'm doing this before I drink anything.
Go back inside.
Smilla.
What?
Don't answer the phone from now on.
Smilla.
What a surprise.
We weren't expecting you.
I thought you didn't celebrate Christmas.
I don't.
So what do you celebrate, Smilla?
Oh, I celebrate the loners, the outcasts, the shy girl with pimples, the fattest boy in class, dyslexics, the stutterers, the premature ejaculators.
You're such a freak.
Some men died on an expedition to the west coast of Greenland.
I need to know why.
Will you look at them for me?
I thought you wanted to have lunch with us.
Do this for me, Moritz.
I'm happy today for the first time in ages.
The man with the white hair.
Do you know him?
Dr. Andreas Tork.
Scientist.
Leading specialist in arctic mineralogy.
Powerful man.
Very ambitious.
Head of Greenland Mining.
Why? You want to meet him?
Why would someone examine a child every month at a hospital?
If he'd been exposed to a virus, to, uh...
Why would someone shove a biopsy needle into a dead 6-year-old?
Oh, gross. I'm not eating now.
Forget it.
Answer me.
I'm not eating a bloody thing, Moritz.
I don't know, Smilla.
To measure the progress of something... you know.
Thank you.
Call me when you've looked at that.
I was following you.
He recognized me from the funeral.
He stopped me and asked me how Juliane was doing. That's all.
You were with him.
I was not with him!
We started to talk.
I thought I could learn more about
Greenland Mining.
I was following you there.
Smilla.
Smilla.
Don't you trust me?
No.
Juliane:
I told you, we have nothing!
Nothing!
You fucking bastard!
Oh...
Leave us alone!
Isaiah.
What happened?
It's O.K.
It's me, Smilla.
Isaiah.
Smilla?
How did you find me?
It wasn't hard.
You're considered the best ear in Copenhagen.
You called about a tape.
It was left next to an electrical box.
Maybe that's what affected the sound on it.
I can't make it out.
Sounds like some kind of an announcement.
I can't hear anything.
That's because you haven't trained your ear.
Hear it now?
It's not live.
It's coming from a loudspeaker.
An intercom.
Maybe in a hospital somewhere.
Can you hear the doctor's beeper?
No.
And there's someone whispering, too.
What's he saying?
He's in a lot of pain.
There's an EEG in there as well, monitoring his heart.
What's he saying?
It's difficult to say.
It's an East Greenlandic dialect.
He's...
He's talking to his son...
Isaiah.
He's trying to tell what happened in an ice cave.
Did you hear that?
That's a Sikorsky R17 overhead.
Late '93, early '94.
This must be the hospital in the American air base in Thule.
I'm amazed you can conclude so much from so little.
Blindness sharpens the sense of hearing.
Is there any way you can clean up the tape?
Come back in an hour.
Woman: Are you finished with that?
Man: Yeah, that's all right.
Hello?
Were you really just following me?
Yes.
I want to kiss you again.
Would you like that?
Yes.
Smilla, where are you?
Smilla?
Mr. Licht?
Open the door!
Open it!
Open it!
Talk to me.
You have to talk now, Smilla.
Snow. Talk to me about snow.
So many.
There's too many kinds.
Say them!
Qanik.
What's that? Hmm?
Talk.
It's falling snow.
What other kinds?
Aquilluqqag.
It's wet, wet snow.
It's not firm enough to build a snow house with.
You must never use it for that.
I won't.
Promise me?
I promise.
More. Come on, more.
Did you hear the tape?
They killed Isaiah for it.
Did you get it?
No.
He could have made it.
Not like Smilla, the fake.
The fake Greenlander with her fine clothes and manners.
I let him die.
No, you didn't.
The tablets will start to work in a few minutes.
Then it won't hurt so much.
You must sleep now.
When I was little,
I knew where I was going.
Yes.
I'm very lost now.
Stay with me.
I'm right here.
Lie down with me.
Kinngusaqattaarpoq.
What does it mean?
Say it.
I can't say it.
To practice rolling over in a kayak.
Makittaqanngitsoq.
Pff. Jesus.
Someone who has never mastered the art of rolling over in a kayak.
Umiiarneq.
A shipwrecked person.
You're not shipwrecked.
Pilluaqaanga.
It's to be deeply happy.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Smilla?
You cannot stay in your apartment.
They've already tried to kill you once, and if they know you're alive, they won't make the same mistake again.
Now go to your father's house.
You'll be safer with him.
I've seen that car before.
Don't turn around.
They found something in 1966.
Something went wrong, and they waited 30 years before they sent another expedition.
But then something else went wrong.
There was an accident.
4 men died.
One of them was Isaiah's father.
So before Isaiah's father dies, he sends his son a tape telling him what really happened.
Tork comes looking for the tape, they kill Isaiah to get it.
And then they killed the man on the boat.
There's got to be something else on that tape.
Like what they really found up there in Greenland.
They're planning to go up again.
They've had to wait until now for the pack ice to melt in the Davis Strait.
I know a man... who knows about boats.
Norsaq Christiansen, dead, on the Gela Alta glacier,
July 1993.
Hmm.
It says in the report that he died in an explosion, but I don't think that's what killed these men.
These are enlargements
I made from the negatives.
You can see what remains of the liver, the esophagus, stomach.
This is the heart... what's left of it.
Smilla?
Do you notice anything unusual here?
Something's got into the heart.
But what is it?
This... This is so gross.
What's it got to do with us?
Get her out of here.
Darling, why don't you wait for me outside?
I'll join you later.
But it's disgusting.
What's it got to do with us?
I'll be with you soon.
Please. Please.
Smilla?
This is the arctic worm.
Drancunculus Borealis.
Prehistoric.
No one has seen pictures of them before.
Loyen must have photographed them.
You see, the female worm entered these men's vital organs.
The uterus burst.
There were 10 million larvae released.
The men go into toxic shock.
They die on the spot.
But it's very strange.
Parasites don't usually kill their hosts.
It's very bad manners.
But I thought the worm was extinct.
I thought so too, Smilla.
But the question is, what brought them back to life?
Why are you getting involved in this?
I told you before... a child died.
It's my New Year's resolution to make someone pay.
This friend of yours who dropped you off.
Is he also involved?
I don't know.
I don't know him very well.
He has a repair shop which he never goes to.
His hands are much too clean.
He lies to me.
I don't know what he does.
Are you in love with him?
I've been trying to avoid it all my life, so now that it's here,
I just want to renounce it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm tired of wondering why it is that every day
I'm on this earth
I'm in exile.
I'm sorry you're so angry.
I'm sorry
I made you do things.
Is it time for confession, Moritz?
What things did you make me do?
I made you leave your country.
What were you supposed to do, leave me there?
I punished you, because your mother was dead.
I'd look at you, and I'd see her face.
I never loved anyone the way I loved your mother.
Benja will be sorry to hear that.
It's late, Smilla. I'm going to bed.
All day today I thought about your hands on me.
Your mouth on my mouth.
This friend of yours, Lander.
What does he do?
He owns the place.
Now, what can I do for you?
I need to know where the boat is going... why it's going, and who's behind it.
The ship you saw, the Kronos, it's classified ice class.
They spent an incredible amount of money getting her ready.
Whatever they're after has to be very lucrative for them to recoup the investment they've made.
But you don't know...
Normally a ship is chartered with a crew.
But in this situation, you would prefer a bare-boat charter... a ship and nothing else.
Then you find a captain.
He has to be a special kind of person, the kind you can take aside, and over a full glass tell him that his wages will be a little out of the ordinary.
On the other hand, you need all his tact and sensitivity.
Where would someone find such a person?
Right here.
That gentleman over there.
Captain Sigmund Lukas.
A very, very skilled
German seaman.
Knows the North Atlantic like no one else.
Doesn't drink, but he gambles.
He no longer has a home or a family.
And now he's for sale, if the amount is big enough.
If he's so broke, whose money is he playing with?
Uncle Lander's money, honey.
That's why he's going to be nice to you.
This is not a game.
If you go on board that boat, they'll kill you.
I need to know what happened to him.
You don't even know where the boat is going.
Wherever the boat is going,
I'll find out why they killed Isaiah.
They've come for you.
Just keep walking.
Don't turn around.
Lander'll be waiting outside.
Go to your father's house.
Wait there.
I'll meet you there.
Man: Perfect!
Miss Jaspersen?
Miss Jaspersen.
Go.
- Open this door!
- Go!
I need you to help me get on the Kronos.
What makes you think
I can help?
Just talk to Lukas.
My life is shit.
But whatever it's worth
I owe to your boyfriend, so the answer is no.
I'm going whether you help me or not.
Wait, wait, wait.
You scare me, honey.
Other women, it's all threat, and no action.
You, I believe.
You'll go anyway and get yourself really fucked.
So give me a call when you're ready.
Thank you, Lander.
O.K., thank you very much.
It's the door straight on.
Benja?
You don't belong here.
They're going to take you away.
You can't run away your whole life.
We'll get you a good lawyer.
They'll find a way to kill me, or I'll just have an accident.
I was resisting arrest.
I tried to escape.
And you'll spend your wretched life knowing you could have saved me.
Are you going, or should I get...
Give us a minute.
But you promised me!
Quiet!
She is crazy!
I can't take this anymore!
Will you be quiet?
What do you want me to do?
Drive your car to the back so I can get in, and lie down on the floor, and then cover me.
Lander.
Where are you?
Meet me at the marina.
Thank you, Lander.
I'm coming.
Once you drive off,
I'll send them after you.
Benja.
Leave me alone.
Emergency at the hospital.
Good night.
Thanks for your help.
I wanted peace and quiet so badly, wanted my family around me, but I never achieved that.
I don't want to let you go, Smilla.
I'll take that.
Thank you, Lander.
Change your mind and come back with me.
I can't do that.
Man: Ooh, sweet thing.
Men: Welcome back, welcome back.
We've been waiting for you.
Nils Jakkelsen.
Stick with me.
I can do things for you.
You know what I mean?
You can start by getting my bag.
Man: That's one way to do it.
I'll take you to the captain.
To your left, upstairs.
Here.
Straight on.
It's in there.
You can go, Jakkelsen.
You're on board because we needed a cabin steward.
Your duties include light cleaning, and you're responsible for the ship's laundry.
You can go now.
We have representatives from the shipping company with us, living on the upper boat deck.
There's no admittance whatsoever.
If you disobey this order,
I'll have you locked up.
How about a quick fuck?
Women are crazy about me.
Hmm.
Smilla Qaavigaq Jaspersen.
That must be a Greenlandic middle name.
What's on the upper deck?
Fucked if I know, man.
I've never seen security like this before.
This whole outfit is weird.
Even the captain says he doesn't know where we're headed.
And the crew.
They're a pile of shit, and they stick together.
They are scared, and they won't tell me why.
And then the passengers on the upper deck we never get to see.
Who the fuck are they?
Then there's you, Smilla.
Why'd Lukas let you on board?
Everyone thinks you're a cop.
You're spying on me?
Actually, Jakkelsen,
I came for a quick fuck.
But you spoiled it by talking.
And you're gonna help me, you little needle freak.
No way.
I get claustrophobic.
I'm not kidding.
You're not going.
I am.
I get claustrophobic.
Press the button for the upper deck.
If anyone tries to send you away, just refuse to leave.
Give me an hour.
If I'm not back in a hour, wake up Lukas.
No. I can't do that, man.
Why not?
He's my father.
That's why I'm on board.
That's why I have the key.
He thinks I'm clean.
You'd do that to me, man?
You'd tell him?
In a second.
Now send me up.
Gentlemen.
What we are planning to bring back from our expedition to Greenland is a scientific sensation... the most valuable discovery ever made.
An energy-producing meteorite, the fragment of a planet from the beginning of creation, back from the origin of the solar system.
Not only will it multiply our investment, but it will give our company a very dominating position in the world.
But there's a drawback.
The stone brought a lethal prehistoric organism back to life.
It's a kind of worm.
Some of our men were killed by this worm when they were diving in the melt water around the meteorite on our last expedition.
The only survivor is a child, who, unfortunately, ran into the water in an attempt to reach his father, one of the divers.
Ever since this incident, this child has been kept under observa...
Man:: Give me your hand here.
This worm is always fatal, but only when it reaches the inner organs.
It seems that young people can live with it longer, presumably because their immune systems are stronger.
They're out of champagne.
What did you see up there?
Enough to nail those bastards.
I've got her!
No!
What else could I do?
I lit a cigar and put it up to the sensor.
I'm really fucked now, man.
They know it's me.
Bunch of freaks!
What the hell did you do to make them want to kill you?
They want to kill both of us.
This is the captain.
We're approaching the Nordic Star platform.
We'll be docked for about half an hour.
All crew members are confined to quarters.
No one is to leave the ship.
I repeat:
No one is to leave the ship.
I've got to get off now.
Don't look so panicky.
Just stay close to
Jakkelsen the Great.
Ever been to Hong Kong?
They offered me a modeling contract once.
Let's go there.
You are expressly refused permission to leave the ship.
Any crew member attempting to do so will be arrested and taken into custody.
Won't he worry about you?
I'll send him a telegram.
Let's get out of here.
How about a quick fuck before we go?
Once the lights go out, give me a head start, and then follow me.
Relax, man.
You can make it up to me in Hong Kong.
Man: Aah!
Get up!
We're almost there.
I don't feel well.
It'll be hard to find a modeling job.
Never look right at the audience.
You got to look over their heads.
Proud. Like you don't give a shit.
Like a fucking star, man.
Like a star.
Yeah, Jakkelsen.
Like a star.
Oil rigging will commence in 45 minutes.
Please be sure to secure all your safety clothing as recommended by the Ansi safety standards.
Oil rigging will commence in 45 minutes.
Please be sure to secure all your safety clothing as recommended by the Ansi safety standards.
What are they paying you?
Is it enough?
The g-government never pays well enough.
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
The government knew that there was something big going on.
They didn't know what it was exactly, but they knew they were going again.
They hired me because I was a diver, because I was the kind of person that Tork needed.
I met him, he trusted me.
He arranged for me to move into the building to keep an eye on the boy.
I didn't even know that he was sick.
You never loved him!
Of course I loved him!
I just wanted to protect him, and for a while,
I thought that I could.
Listen to me.
Listen.
There's not a night that goes by... that I don't dream that I catch him.
I catch him in my arms...
...before he hits the ground.
We can start over.
Tork and Loyen are desperate.
They're under extreme pressure.
They'll show no mercy.
You can hide in my cabin, but only for a little while.
The ship is approaching the coast.
You've to get ashore.
Just go inland. Wait for me.
There's a village just inside the bay about 7 miles to the south.
You see how it's drawing energy from some sort of vacuum in the center?
I knew you'd come.
For people with resources, the right events happen.
They may look like coincidences, but they arise out of necessity.
Incredible, isn't it?
We can see inside it.
It's not a real meteorite.
Meteorites are cold. This is warm.
Meteorites are dead.
This... is alive.
And why are you doing all this, Tork?
Why, money.
Fame. More money.
This is the biggest scientific discovery of the century.
You can't remove it and transport it to a densely populated part of the world.
Not until you know exactly what it is.
You could set off a catastrophe.
Oh, death is always a waste, but sometimes it is the only way to arouse people.
Bohr participated in the construction of the atom bomb and thought it would promote peace.
You lack imagination, Smilla, which is unforgivable in a scientist.
What about the boy?
He jumped into the damn water.
We were forced to take him along into the cave.
His father collapsed while he was still near the surface.
The boy wanted to go to him.
It was Loyen's idea to keep him under observation.
The worm was not in his internal organs.
He never even felt it.
Aaarrrgh!
He killed my son.
Tork!
Tork!
The boy, Tork.
Tell me about the day he died.
You were waiting outside his school, weren't you, Tork?
He's the only child who walks home alone.
Smilla: You follow him.
You grab him, not by his arms, but by his clothes so you don't leave any marks.
But you miscalculate.
He knows you, Tork,
Not from the hospital where you spent hours tormenting him, but from the day he saw his father die.
It's death itself he associates with you.
You're guessing.
He gets to his building and then there's no escape.
He knows what's behind him.
He knows he's going to die.
This fear is even stronger than his fear of heights.
Inside him an engine is spinning that will keep turning until all his strength is used up.
And you chase him up to the roof.
Maybe for the first time it occurs to you not just to get the tape... but that it's possible to eliminate him.
And avoid him ever telling anyone what he saw in a cave on a glacier somewhere in the Davis Strait.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I needed the tape.
He panicked, I shouted, he turned around, he didn't see me.
You're lying.
He didn't turn around.
He couldn't hear a thing.
He was deaf.
Go on, Barbara.
We go back to our homeroom for dismissal.
Unless you have a pass for sports or something.
Is that what you did on the day in question?
No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class.
What happened next, Barbara?
He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk.
Barbara.
If you will, in your own words, tell us exactly what happened... in the next few minutes.
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.
He promised I'd get to the bus on time if I'd help him do something.
Then, before I could say anything, he placed his hand inside my blouse.
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.
Then his other hand went up under inside my skirt.
Then, with his hand... he started moving back and forth... farther and farther inside my skirt.
He said he was testing to see if I had any special feelings... that he wanted to see what kind of feelings I had.
I was trying to think of something to say, but I couldn't.
I was confused, and he just kept on.
I asked him to stop, but it was like he couldn't hear.
He just kept on with his hand.
Then I screamed.
Then he got mad and said we'd have to try it again sometime.
Did he try again?
Not with me.
But with your friends?
Yes.
And after you had told them what he had done to you... they told you what he had done to them!
Isn't that true?
Yes.
I have nothing further.
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
Any chance, Your Honor, for a short recess?
Of course.
This court will be in recess for 15 minutes.
- Honey, what...?
- Not now, Bernice.
Lomax, what's wrong?
As your attorney, I'm advising you to keep the fuck away from me.
Why? What are you talking about?
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.
Hey, you're my lawyer.
You're here to defend me.
Know what I think? Why not put you on the stand? You can jerk off for the judge.
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.
Well, hell, there you are.
Rumor was you were out wandering in traffic.
Not now, Larry.
What's the game plan?
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.
Give me a quote.
Fuck off.
Mr. Lomax had no comment on today's events.
Speculation, however, was widespread... that the young lawyer's unblemished string of victories... would come to an end... in this courtroom.
It was a nice run, Kev.
Had to close out someday.
Nobody wins them all.
Have you had any discipline problems... in math class this year?
No.
No?
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you repeatedly about your behavior?
Isn't that why he asked you to stay after class?
No.
Have other teachers asked you to stay after class?
Once or twice.
- Did they want to talk about your behavior?
- Objection. Immaterial.
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.
You may answer the question.
I don't know what the other teachers wanted.
You'd have to talk to them.
You ever pass notes in class, Barbara?
Maybe a note that... made fun of Mr. Gettys?
- No.
- No?
Never called him a disgusting pig monster?
Order.
No.
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
Defense Exhibit A.
Objection. We've had plenty of time for discovery here.
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.
I'm also going to suggest that if you have any other exhibits... you present them in a timely fashion, or not at all.
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.
It's huge hog beast.
This is your handwriting, isn't it?
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.
- It's a joke.
- "He's a huge hog beast."
He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast."
You're writing about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?
It was meant to be a joke.
Have you ever had a party at your house, Barbara... when your parents were away?
Objection. Your Honor, this is way out of line.
- Credibility and bias.
- Overruled.
Answer the question.
Yes.
Have you ever heard of a game called "Special Places"?
You're under oath, Barbara.
A man's career... his reputation... his life is on the line.
This is not a joke.
Have you ever played the game "Special Places"?
Yes.
Is this game sexual in nature?
Is this game sexual in nature?
We only played it once.
This special party, Barbara... this was the first time you told the story about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?
Yes.
I've spoken to other children who were there that day.
Is there anything else they may have told me about the party?
Objection. If he has other witnesses, let him call them.
If I need to call those other children, I will.
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.
Rephrase your question.
You threatened those children, didn't you?
That's not the way it happened.
You told them to lie, to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.
These things did happen.
If they didn't, you were going to tell everyone about this special party.
They happened to me.
So you made up a story. A special story.
A story about a math teacher... who was tough on you, who kept you after class.
A huge hog beast you didn't like!
That's what really happened, isn't it?
No.
I didn't want to be the only one.
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch...
You leave that girl alone, that's enough.
Bailiff, evict that man.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'm going to adjourn for the day.
We'll be back here at 9:00 in the morning and people will behave themselves...
You made me proud.
Or find themselves in contempt.
Good evening.
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.
- You go, Gators.
- Yeah.
In the event that we all get drunk, let's front-load the ceremonial bullshit.
To the best trial lawyer in Alachua County.
Damn straight.
So, Kev, off the record... how's it feel to squeeze a man like Gettys... through the door of reasonable doubt?
Larry.
Why don't you quit being a party pooper?
Have yourself a drink.
We're not going to discuss the damn case anymore.
Am I right?
I'll drink to that.
No shop talk.
- Pour me another.
- Hey, baby.
Lomax, you're wild.
I feel one of them nights coming on.
I've seen the Eiffel Tower
And I've seen the Taj Mahal
And I've even been to China
And I've seen the Great Wall
I've seen the Pacific Ocean
The Statue of Liberty
I gotta go piss.
- What?
- I gotta go piss.
I gotta go piss!
Okay.
Hurry.
Hey!
Show me your tattoo
Mr. Lomax. Hell of a job today.
I don't want to disturb your party.
"Milton, Chadwick, Waters."
Never heard of it.
What are you going to do? Sue me?
Actually, we were hoping to retain your services.
We've been following your progress.
From New York?
You've never lost a case.
I've had some sympathetic juries.
That's exactly what we're looking for.
We want you to come to New York, help us pick a jury.
I tell you, man... you're pretty damn good.
Your card is great.
And the black thing, you being black...
Whose idea was that? Paul's?
That's just brilliant.
I'm just not drunk enough yet to fall for it.
I'll buy you a drink when I...
You'd have to start next week.
All expenses, first-class travel and lodging, you and your wife.
A lump-sum payment, regardless of the verdict, in the amount of...
Well, hey.
Take a look.
Please, baby, baby, please
Please, show me your tattoo
Baby
In the name of Lord Jesus... we refute you, Satan, and cast you out and go forth with the zeal of the Lord.
Amen.
Romans 16:19 says!
Be excellent in what is good
Be innocent of evil
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan
God will crush him
Underneath your feet
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan
God will crush him
Underneath your feet
Romans 16:19 says
All the way to New York just to pick a jury?
Every dog gets his day.
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann on this adventure?
I gotta tell you, Ma, this routine's getting awful tired.
Working on Sunday.
Working? Ma, get over it.
Ma. Listen to me. I love my wife.
Okay? I love her all the way.
Just like you.
- Let me tell you about New York.
- Let me guess.
Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.
It has become a dwelling place of demons.
Revelation 18.
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?
And what happened to Babylon?
Thou mighty city, in one hour has thy mighty judgment come.
And the light of a single lamp shall shine in thee no more.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
I'll miss you.
No. Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.
I'm trying to work with you.
They'll be looking for that payment and if it's not there, they'll repo the car.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta go.
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.
Okay. Make the payment.
- Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?
- Yep.
We better give her some grandkids soon so I can get her off my back.
What do you say?
Let her sweat a little.
Do you think, as a juror... you'd be able to set aside any prior opinion you might hold... about the savings-and-loan industry?
That was a question, sir.
What? Do I like bankers?
Your Honor, may I have a minute to confer with my colleagues?
You may.
Dump him.
Let's get rid of Number 4, 6, and I'd say lose Number 12... but the prosecutor will fuck up and do it for us.
Number 6?
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.
She's my first pass.
And 4?
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?
Look, kid, maybe down in Florida you are the next big thing.
This is New York.
We're not squeezing oranges here.
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.
He looks like a brother with an attitude, but I see a man with a gun under his bed.
And woe betide the creature who steps into his garden.
Number 6... your favorite... she's damaged goods.
She's a Catholic schoolteacher, hmm?
Believes in human frailty...
No. Something's missing from her.
She's wrong.
She wants on this jury.
Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.
How the hell do you know that?
I don't know.
Either you put a stop to this happy horseshit or I walk.
Walk.
Here's the deal: If I lose with your jury, you do the explaining.
Your Honor, may I continue?
We'd like to excuse
Jurors 3, 4 and 6.
Hi. You're home early for a change.
I just happened to find out...
I was pregnant on the same day that I got the show.
Your mother called.
She has her bad feeling.
Every now and then, she gets one right.
You okay?
Something's up.
They deliberated for 38 minutes.
Kevin.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.
Yeah.
Except one.
What?
Kev.
Not fucking guilty!
- Oh, my God. You lying sack of shit.
- Ha, ha.
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury.
Yes!
Thirty-eight minutes.
- You did it!
- My jury. I'm too good.
- Glad you could stick around.
- It's your dime.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia longer than expected.
Good morning, Caprice.
Good morning, Mr. Heath.
Your messages.
Not bad?
You can play it cool if you want... but when I first walked in, my jaw was on the floor.
Thank you.
This is our home office.
We have many international arrangements... so Mr. Milton spends a great deal of his time in the air.
- Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.
- Am I good cop or bad cop?
We may not need a good cop.
Oh, I love it.
In addition to our corporate clients we're representing 25 foreign countries:
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa...
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.
Behind you.
I'm sorry.
Please. Kevin Lomax.
- John Milton.
- Nice to meet you.
So?
Have we been treating you well?
Very well, thank you.
And your wife, she had a good time?
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.
That's our secret:
Kill you with kindness.
What's your secret?
I couldn't say.
You were a prosecutor.
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville DA's office.
Sixty-four straight convictions.
What a number.
I like to be in court.
I didn't plea out a lot.
What's that like?
One day you put them away, the next you set them free.
Takes a little getting used to.
- Pays better, though, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
That math teacher, the Gettys case.
Now, I hear you were brilliant.
Prosecutor dropped the ball.
Really?
You think your guy was guilty?
I didn't say that.
What'd you say?
How's this:
I began the case with a clear conscience.
I was sure you had a secret.
The men's room.
Upstairs men's room in the Duval County courthouse.
There's a hole in the wall to the next room.
I spent five years listening to juries deliberate.
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.
Just don't repeat it.
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it.
My lips are sealed.
You don't really want to go back to Florida, do you?
Walk with me.
What do you think?
Some people can't handle it.
It's peaceful.
My sentiments exactly.
Ha, ha. So fill in the résumé for me.
Tell me... your father, what does he do?
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.
My mother raised me. Just the two of us.
- She never remarried?
- She wasn't married the first time.
That can't be easy in a town like Gainesville, can it?
I don't think it's easy anywhere.
Holy shit.
Different when you're looking down, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Oh, my God.
Your mother... what's she like?
She's a preacher's daughter.
She's tough.
She's worked in a poultry plant for as long as I can remember.
She's got a church she really likes, so she's usually there or they go out.
They do a lot of volunteer work.
Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.
So they say.
It didn't rub off?
The Book? The Church?
No, I'm on parole.
Early release for time served.
A lot of potential clients down there.
Are we negotiating?
Always.
Can I ask you a question, then?
Why do you need a criminal department?
Our clients break the law like anyone else.
I'm just tired of sending their business across the street.
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.
It's just the other thing I wonder about.
What thing is that?
Pressure.
It changes everything. Pressure.
Some people, you squeeze them, they focus.
Others fold.
Can you summon your talent at will?
Can you deliver on a deadline?
Can you sleep at night?
When do we talk about money?
Money?
Yeah.
That's the easy part.
They call this part of Fifth Avenue,
Carnegie Hill.
Got the park right across the street, and the reservoir.
Best jogging in New York.
Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.
Some excellent schools.
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list when he bought this building... but great neighborhood for children.
Great building.
Follow the money all the way to the top.
You got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.
- You must be Mary Ann.
- Yes, I am.
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.
It's nice of you to come by.
Oh, please. We live across the hall.
- You're kidding.
- Right there.
It's just two apartments per floor?
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.
Voilà.
Oh, my God.
It's what they call a Classic Eight.
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.
We had them paint it white. Let you see it naked before you pick your palette.
What am I picking?
Palette. Your colors.
Oh, yes.
I need to warn you about one thing.
There are going to be some very envious people down at the firm.
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.
You must've made quite an impression.
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?
Babies.
- It took us six years to get in here.
- Oh, wow.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you very much.
- Jackie.
Kevin.
Are you really this good?
I sure as hell hope so.
They must want you pretty bad.
Look, Mar...
I'm only getting behind this if you're on board.
If you want to go home...
I'm with you.
Sure.
Let's go back to Gainesville, back to the condo.
You keep scrounging for clients and
I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.
And maybe, just maybe, if we kill ourselves... in about five years we can afford a baby and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.
Are you shitting me?
I love you.
I love you too.
Tadashi Osumi, Media.
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.
I run the Islamic subgroup.
Joyce Rensaleer,
Mergers and Acquisitions.
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director... and Real Estate.
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs...
EC and G7.
There it is, Kevin.
The whole team.
Welcome to Milton,
Chadwick and Waters.
So, what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.
I guess it'll do.
Until something better comes along?
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
Pam was at the Brooklyn DA's office
14 years... so she knows her way around the local scene.
You'll expedite his bar application?
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work pro hac vice.
I petitioned Florida for a letter of good conduct.
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request, an overview of the Moyez case.
The Moyez case?
Move, move, move!
What do you think?
It's a health-code case and it's a loser.
So, what's the point?
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?
Isn't everything?
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask... with an embossed floriated pattern of undulating acanthus leaves.
Lovely, isn't it?
And this is about what?
The price?
Oh, it's about 2000 a panel.
We'll take it. At 1400.
You made it.
Hey, baby.
I thought you said it was impossible.
I thought you said it was important.
Go get them.
Go get them, man.
Tell him, "Cut that shit down."
I know what they're doing over there.
That's right.
Tell him, "Take all that noise back to Africa."
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Philippe Moyez.
Look, I'm not sure
I'm making myself clear.
Moyez, you need him?
To speak with him?
Show him your boots.
You're saying he's down here in the basement?
In the dark?
Where do you think I'm taking you?
Ha, ha.
I thought I would recognize you... but I do not.
Mr. Moyez?
We've never met.
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.
I'm here about the animals.
We have an investment in blood.
Think of it as spiritual currency.
Spiritual currency.
Look, Mr. Moyez,
I'm going to need your help with this.
What is the name of the man... who will prosecute us?
Merto.
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?
With this tongue, we create silence.
You can go now.
You will have all the help...
I can give you... against Monsieur Merto.
It's arbor green. What do you think?
Not with your complexion.
New York City health codes.
- That's all of it?
- Not quite.
Thanks.
Caribbean green.
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.
A cooler green.
Too institutional.
I love green.
I love it but it's one thing to wear it and another to have it on your walls.
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.
Remember, it's only a health-code case.
Good night.
This is the first time since I've been 13 years old I don't have a job... or two.
I feel like I'm floating around in that place.
You know, just drifting around or something.
You'll settle in.
We had this little office in the condo...
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.
You know, his side and my side.
Real nice.
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on...
If I want to see Leamon...
I make an appointment.
You're kidding, right?
God, how do you handle it?
Take a look around, honey.
Look, you've got three choices.
The Holy Trinity:
You can work... you can play... or you can breed.
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.
USDA approved and stamped.
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.
He killed a goat.
And he did it at home... in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs.
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.
It's certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone.
It's not as common as, say... circumcision.
It's not as common as the belief that... wine transforms into blood.
Some people handle poisonous snakes to prove their faith.
Some people walk on fire.
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.
And he did it... while observing his constitutionally protected... religious beliefs.
Your Honor, this case is not about keeping goats... or transporting goats or goat licensing.
The city was less concerned with the care of the animals... than the manner with which they were slaughtered.
Objection!
Okay. Enough, enough. I got it.
Let's wrap it up.
Your Honor... the city timed this police action to catch my client... exercising his constitutionally protected right to religious freedom.
This is a law protecting kosher butchering.
Exactly, Your Honor.
I'd like to move at this time for a verdict of dismissal.
I happen to know a little bit about kashruth law, Mr. Lomax.
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.
That's why I feel confident in requesting a dismissal.
Mr. Merto?
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Merto.
For God's sake, man...
- Congratulations. Great job.
- Thanks.
Bravo! Bravo!
Pamela, you look lovely.
So, Philippe... satisfied?
Always, Jean.
Kevin.
What can I say?
Outstanding.
Go figure it, a guy like Moyez... living in some subterranean shithole... all the while he's walking around with $15 million in the bank.
You're kidding.
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?
Tarzan, we're billing you out at 400 an hour, my friend.
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work in your immediate future.
I figured you came down to make sure
I didn't fuck this up.
Maybe I did.
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are... don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.
You've gotta keep yourself small.
Innocuous.
Be the little guy.
You know, the nerd, the leper... the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.
Underestimated from day one.
You'd never think I was a master of the universe, would you?
That's your only weakness, as far as I can see.
What's that?
It's the look.
That Florida stud thing. What is that?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?
Never worked a jury that didn't have a woman.
You know what you're missing?
You're missing what I have.
There's this beautiful girl, just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday... we're done, she's walking to the bathroom, trying to walk... she turns... she looks... it's me.
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.
She gets this look on her face like:
"How the hell did that happen?"
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.
I'm a surprise, Kevin.
They don't see me coming.
That's what you're missing.
- Where's the chicken?
- What?
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe... never loses. He's famous.
Never loses, like you.
Tic-tac-toe.
Come on. I'll show you the fastest way uptown.
Learn the subways, Kevin.
Use them.
Stay in the trenches.
Only way I travel.
Mar?
What happened to the green?
- I loved the green.
- Honey, you're late.
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace in 15 minutes.
What's all this?
All what?
Jackie says the "who's who" of New York is gonna be there tonight.
- All this?
- Oh, that.
It was going to be a nursery... then I remembered you'd have to be home long enough to knock me up.
So now I'm thinking of building a law library.
Oh, baby.
Oh, tell me I can handle this.
You can handle this.
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.
Promise me you won't leave me alone in there.
I promise.
Mm.
There you are.
Hi.
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.
Nice to meet you, sorry we're late.
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.
All hail.
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.
Well, Kevin, here they are.
Top of the food chain and dinner is served.
I throw these parties twice a year.
Stock market, real estate, politics. They're all players, and they're all prospects.
Kevin, congratulations.
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.
Congratulations.
Bright young lights.
Oh, oh, you're going to like this.
Come on.
Somebody I want you to meet.
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax, this is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.
Ambassador Charles Gagano.
In case you didn't know, these are the Republicans of New York.
Barzoon always overstates things.
Donald Trump was supposed to be here, but he had a business emergency.
Probably Mort Zuckerman.
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.
Excuse me. This is important.
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.
- I was married to him.
- Oh, really?
Kidding.
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.
- He's new to the firm.
- Nice to meet you.
The senator cannot leave.
Who's that with the senator?
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?
No, who is he?
I swear he can hear us.
Hell, he can smell us.
Mary Ann...
John Milton.
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.
Already swimming with the sharks.
Careful, hon.
Harry, if you keep thinking small, we'll never make any money on you.
These parties don't come cheap.
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.
Just get it on tape.
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.
Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he... buys a few new suits... learns a few new tricks... he's there.
It's you. What about you?
Your family, you've got to miss them.
No?
I told Kevin the only thing worse than not having a father was having mine.
I can relate.
I can, believe me.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.
The worst vice is advice.
But may I make a suggestion?
It's a sensitive...
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.
No, go ahead.
- I mean, you don't like it?
- No.
I like it fine. It's beautiful.
It's just...
It doesn't belong to you.
You're too alive for a perm.
It's not you.
You should pull your hair back.
Do it. See what happens.
Right now, here, you want me to pull my hair back?
- Is that so terrible?
- Ha, ha.
I'd love to do it, but if I did... everyone in this room who's pretending not to be watching us... would naturally assume we were fucking or something.
Please.
Okay.
It's fun to be right.
Excuse me.
It's a vision.
You've gotta cut your hair.
Are you serious?
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique.
And her neck... if she's alive... has all the mystery of a border town.
A no man's land... in that battle... between the mind and the body.
You know... your natural color would really... bring out your eyes.
Do you have this view?
Sorry?
From your terrace, do you have this view?
Not exactly.
No terrace and I'm about...
12 floors down.
What about you?
No, I live downtown.
This is a... family building.
Sounds like fun.
Downtown, I mean.
I'm just getting to know the city.
Is it everything you expected?
More.
I say we ride them as far as we can, and then eat them.
Excuse me, Jackie.
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?
No. I'm sure he's around.
Okay, thanks.
Are you alone?
You mean, tonight?
Is your wife a jealous woman,
Mr. Lomax?
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.
No. No, really...
I'm fine.
- Yeah?
- I'm fine.
Bet you like to be on top.
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?
Of the situation.
You prefer to be on top, right?
Depends on the view.
You know what I see?
I see the future... of this law firm.
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.
Quickly.
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters in his pocket.
We'll plant a story and destroy his credibility.
Pam, have you seen Kevin?
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.
If he doesn't come to us, he'll regret it.
Come on.
Is there more to it?
Just this room.
And a bedroom?
Nope. No bedroom.
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?
Where does he fuck?
Everywhere.
What's up, John?
Leamon, how many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?
What did he do now?
Alex Cullen has just been charged with murdering his wife... her stepson... and a maid.
When did this happen?
Just now. Tonight.
I've sent Pam downtown to make bail arrangements.
They're gonna fucking crucify him.
They're gonna line up. I gotta call Meisel.
No, no, no.
I want Kevin on this case.
I hope you're kidding.
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?
Ha! You're dreaming.
You know, I've shaken hands... with every marquee defense attorney in this town.
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.
John, you've got a great eye for talent.
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.
I want you on board, Eddie.
I appreciate the vote of confidence, but maybe Eddie has a point here.
We can get this case.
The man's our client.
He's a business client.
We know him better than he knows himself.
We've got the inside track.
We've got the best damn trial lawyer in the city. It's ours to lose.
Well.
Tell that to Cullen.
I want Kevin to tell him.
There's Pam.
You gonna fight for this thing or not?
Pam?
No, it's Kevin.
Hi. No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah.
Where are we at?
You left me there.
I had a fucking panic attack until Jackie told me where you were.
Three hours, you don't even call?
Stop.
Reset.
I'm upstairs. I'm with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.
There's a good possibility I'm about to catch a triple-homicide defendant... who also happens to be... one of the largest real-estate developers in this city.
Mar, I had to bail on the party.
You bailed on me.
Mar.
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself.
For three whole hours.
The next time you make a promise, try and keep it.
You gotta be kidding me, right?
Go to hell. And you can go to sleep on the fucking couch!
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.
Look at this.
I'm not out 20 minutes, and I'm being followed by the press.
They're like insects.
Alex, just calm down and listen, okay?
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ.
This is my ass we're talking about, John.
Eddie?
Alex, you know how this town works.
You've got enemies here you haven't heard from.
Now, with this... now that you're down...
I'd get ready for one of those...
Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.
You know what's coming.
Now you're going to have to ask yourself, who do you trust?
Who do you trust, Alex?
I don't know.
I'm gonna have to look around.
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.
Jury selection started today at every breakfast table in the city.
This is what people know:
Three dead bodies.
You discover the crime.
You call it in. You've got blood on your person and clothes.
And, Mr. Cullen...
Your prints are on the murder weapon.
How do you know that?
There's a second print in blood.
It's a partial of a hand on the wall next to the bodies.
I have keys. I called the cops from the house. I touched the goddamn wall.
I panicked. I was panicked.
We need 12 people who can see past all that.
- I touched the goddamn wall.
- I'd get in front of this fast.
I panicked. Is that a crime?
I didn't kill anybody.
This is a nightmare.
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.
He's right, Alex.
People need to hear these things.
Christ, Eddie. Jesus.
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?
We'll move over.
But right now, this moment... you need immediate representation.
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter... who I care more about than anything in this world.
They wouldn't let me talk to her from downtown.
They won't let me talk to her now that I'm out.
We need to issue a statement.
He's a winner, Alex.
Just like you were.
And they'll never see him coming.
Jesus Christ.
I've got some tough phone calls
I've got to...
All right.
My place, tomorrow.
Alone.
You better be every fucking inch as good as he says you are.
Not if they were giving it away.
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.
- Andrea?
- Yes?
Another one of these, please.
Right away.
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes...
I want you loose and pliable this afternoon.
Get another bottle of chardonnay for Mrs. Barzoon and Mrs. Heath.
Oh, Lord, this is $3000.
You know what you should do?
You should buy it... wear it once, and then throw it away.
That will loosen you up.
I say spend it all.
If you never see your husband, have a relationship with his money.
- Ha, ha.
- I swear... if Eddie wasn't afraid of me shouting my mouth off... he would've put a cellulite clause in the pre-nup.
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you... he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.
Who does it better than that?
It's not my tits I'm worried about.
Not too big...
Perfect.
Real or not?
They look real.
They must be real.
Feel them.
Oh, no, it's okay, really.
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.
Oh.
Feel real?
Yes, absolutely real.
Dr. Robert.
When you're ready.
Oh, God.
So, what do you think?
I don't care if they can hear me.
I don't care!
I don't like it here, Kevin.
And these women. My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake.
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!
- Calm down.
- No!
- Listen to me. Mar.
- No!
Mar!
First...
You do this radical thing to your hair.
Oh, you hate it.
Stop. I think it's fine.
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.
You've got the pressure of fitting in with new friends.
A new place.
- Add to that a couple bottles of wine.
- No.
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.
It wasn't the wine, or my hair, or talking to Kathy... or anything like that.
Because I know that's what you're gonna say.
What about Kathy?
What about your sister?
- What about her? She's pregnant again.
- Oh.
That's got nothing to do with this?
Kevin, I never see you anymore.
And now that you've got this big case, it's just only gonna get worse.
If you can believe it...
I'm actually looking forward to having your mother come and visit.
What about the apartment?
Goddamn you!
Why do you always change things around?
This is not about the apartment.
I hate this stupid place!
You know... you buy a couple new suits and you're fine.
It's a little more than that.
I have this whole fucking place to fill!
I know we have all this money and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not.
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.
And God...
I am so lonely.
I miss you so much.
I'm sorry, baby.
I don't know what to do.
Let's make a baby.
Don't tease me.
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you asked.
Oh, baby.
Do you have this view?
Kevin.
Make love to me.
Kevin. What are you doing?
Stop. Stop.
Oh, God.
God. Where are you?
I'm right here.
No, you're not.
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.
Because I need to know and understand exactly... what happened.
You're standing there, you look down... there's the gun.
I don't know why I picked it up.
It was before I saw Lucinda's body.
You kneeled down to pick it up?
You work late, you come home, you walk in, everybody's dead.
It's not something you plan for.
Stop. Back up.
Two prints by the gun.
"Right hand.
Right knee."
Right knee.
We've been over this.
I'm trying to picture it.
Your hand...
Your hand came from... inside and underneath?
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.
There. Did you see it? Was it clear?
You got it?
Whose gun is that?
- It's mine.
- Are you out of your mind?
You're charged with a triple homicide, you're walking around with a gun?
I have had nine death threats.
Give it over. Give me the gun.
I gotta protect myself.
That's my job. When the case is over, you can have it back.
This is a deal breaker, Alex.
Okay.
Let's wrap it up.
So, what's next?
We need to talk to your assistant,
Mrs. Black.
Call her.
You feel confident she'll back you on the time?
Melissa, yeah, yeah.
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.
Okay.
We're going to talk to her... and you're not going to talk to anybody, all right?
All right?
No comment.
There they are.
Kevin, how about a couple shots?
How does it feel to get the biggest murder trial in New York?
Look over here. Are you really going to plead Cullen not guilty?
What is happening?
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.
Well, he always did like to stick his nose in the camera.
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.
Mrs. Lomax, did you have a nice dinner?
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?
- Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.
- Oh. Ha, ha.
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.
Speak of the devil.
I was just telling them the Moyez story.
Really?
This is your mother?
Yes, Mom, this is...
- John Milton.
- John Milton.
Alice Lomax.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?
Mary Ann.
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.
This is...
I believe you met Christabella.
Yes, I think we did.
And Gizelle.
Fresh in from Paris.
Great.
Nice to meet you.
Three for you and my place.
Thanks for the champagne.
Oh, you're very welcome, Kevin.
This isn't really your first visit to New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?
Yes.
You've done one hell of a job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.
And I'm sure it wasn't easy.
No.
- Mom, we're here.
- Yes.
- Good night to you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mary Ann.
Kevin, hang on.
Oh, how about Cullen? How's it going?
Everything on beam?
That's a long conversation.
Want to come up and tell me?
Now?
Let's talk tomorrow.
You sure?
Yeah.
Is that what you're doing when you're working late?
- What're you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.
I'm going to bed.
- Good night, Alice.
- Night.
Oh, shit.
Mom.
Mom, what are you doing?
I'm going home.
What? What are you talking about?
I don't feel right.
Look, you just got here.
And I just got my teeth kicked in on the front page, so I gotta run.
We'll talk later, okay?
Okay?
I have to go, Kevin.
I miss my church.
This is New York. There must be
20,000 churches. Take your pick.
You need to do a better job with Mary Ann.
She is not well.
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.
Take care of her, if you're so concerned.
Help me out.
I'll take her home if you let me.
This is home. Understand?
This is where we live.
I'm not going back to Gainesville.
Unbelievable.
Wide is the gate... and broad is the way that leadeth to temptation.
It's a little early for Scripture.
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.
Does my babysitter have to testify?
We need her to establish the time you returned home.
She doesn't have a green card, is why I ask.
I would hate for her to get in trouble.
Tell you what, Melissa.
Let's talk to her first. See where she stands and take it from there.
I'll make sure
Melissa gets down to the car.
- Thanks, Pam.
- Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.
I know him. He's a difficult man, but he couldn't kill anyone.
That's why we're all working so hard.
Thank you.
Can I have the car stop at my ex-husband's?
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.
George, remember, no shredding in the building trash.
- Only in the private refuse.
- Yes, sir.
Excelsior Securities, who's handling that?
- I am.
- All this has got to go.
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus...
Mark. No, no, no.
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.
I thought I was the only one working late.
Well, so did we.
Back to work. This is not a break.
Good news.
We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant.
Looks like a great alibi.
What a pleasant surprise.
Looks like you've got your hands full.
Oh, it's just a little... housekeeping.
If anyone should ask... you never saw this.
Who would ask?
- Weaver.
- Who's that?
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.
- You don't know about Weaver?
- Sorry.
How nice for you.
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.
Title fight.
Roy Jones Jr.
- I'd have to call Mary Ann.
- Do it on the way.
Get my message?
I did. You write beautifully.
What's this Weaver Commission?
I don't like to micro-manage.
Find the talent, then delegate.
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.
Excuse me.
What the fuck are you looking at?
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?
I hear you fine.
So get the fuck out of my car.
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.
Motherfucker, I'm telling you...
- ...get the fuck out of my car...
- Shit.
Get out before I cut your throat.
Fuck that.
How do you know...?
Enjoy yourself. You still got time.
There's a train coming the other way.
You'll just catch it.
You'll thank me in the morning.
- You ain't right, man.
- Oh, I'm right.
You'll see.
Invigorating.
What did you say to him?
I told him if he didn't leave us alone, you'd kick his ass.
Look, there's a lady getting up from her seat. Come on.
Get some! You wanna lose?
You are on!
No, no, no.
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now.
Fixed!
- What a beauty.
- I'm glad you could come.
I want you to meet my new heavyweight, here: Kevin Lomax.
- Kevin Lomax. How are you?
- I'm well.
And say what?
He's the senior partner at the...
Mar, you're really starting to piss me off.
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Go to bed. I have no idea.
Ho! Ha!
Stop. This guy pays our bills.
The food, the heat, the rent on that enormous apartment we live in.
I live there too.
Mar.
Give it back to me.
I play the trumpet too.
Kevin.
Babs Coleman.
Kevin Lomax.
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.
There's Tiffany.
New additions. Where are you from?
Don't tell me.
Michigan.
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.
How did he know?
That is so good.
Cheers.
Kevin?
Honey?
Hello?
Who's there?
I got a knife.
Oh, Jesus.
Baby... how'd you get here?
Are you okay?
Oh, God.
Where's your mommy?
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?
What are you playing with?
What are you playing with?
Oh, God!
Oh, God! No! God!
Baby, please.
Baby, there is no blood.
There is no blood. It was a dream.
It was a dream.
It's not a dream if it's true.
Look, let's get you undressed and in the tub, okay?
No.
I know you.
You'll leave me now for sure.
No! Get away from me.
Okay.
Okay, I'm... I'm confused.
Why?
What is it now?
Did you like the green?
You did, didn't you?
We should go back to the green.
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.
They took my ovaries, Kevin.
What?
They took my ovaries!
I told you. Right here.
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.
My sisters have seven children between them.
My mother had Derek when she was 45.
You could've set a clock by my periods.
Baby... what are you talking about?
Kevin, I can't have children.
What?
Says who?
The doctor.
I was there yesterday.
Non-specific ovarian failure.
That's ridiculous.
Oh, God.
Did you just hear that?
Listen.
Can you hear that?
No.
You're going to leave me, aren't you?
Mary Ann.
I know you.
God...
No, Kevin.
It's these monsters.
I dreamt about this.
Baby, I gotta take this.
No, you've gotta listen to me.
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Why do...?
I gotta take this.
It's going to be okay.
Yeah.
Fuck!
I knew the DA was holding out on us.
Get the discovery package over here, right now.
Mm-hm. I don't care. Find Cullen.
I get one supervised hour a week with my stepdaughter.
I am in there with two shrinks and three social workers.
You better have a good reason for calling me out.
Your wife, the day she was killed, had lunch with a friend.
She says, and I quote: "Alex is fucking around and I can prove it."
That's hearsay. That never gets in.
Wrong answer.
Your prenuptial agreement's on file at the firm.
The contract is void in the event of marital infidelity.
You fuck around, she gets rich.
That's a motive, Alex.
What do I need to know?
Melissa, my assistant.
She wasn't even that good a fuck.
And... on the night in question?
I was boning my assistant the night my wife got shot.
I've got to re-interview Melissa.
No, forget it. We're not telling that story.
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.
- Alessandra, wait.
- Alex...
- Alessandra.
- Alex.
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please.
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.
- Alex.
- I can't.
This isn't fair. I had 15 more minutes.
You'll just have to wait until next week.
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.
For sleep.
And she can take that during the day?
No, she won't be driving.
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.
He's not sure. He thinks it could be some kind of hormonal imbalance.
I'm taking you off the case.
What?
I want you to drop this case.
This case? Cullen?
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?
She's sick.
Everyone will understand.
I'll understand.
What about Cullen?
We find somebody new.
You consult.
You live to fight another day.
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.
It's a disappointment. We have them.
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.
Hang on.
We've gotta talk about this.
Aw, listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."
It's your wife, man.
She's sick, she needs you.
She's got to come first.
All right, wait a minute.
Do you mean the possibility of leaving this case has never entered your mind?
You know what scares me?
I quit the case, she gets better... and I hate her for it.
I don't want to resent her.
I've got a winner here.
I've got to nail this fucker down and put it behind me. Just get it done.
Then... then... put all my energy into her.
I stand corrected.
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant admit to the affair?
She did to me, but she won't in court.
Convince her otherwise.
And when all that evidence is laid before you... when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude... you will know... that Alexander Cullen is guilty... of murdering three people... in cold blood... and with malice aforethought.
Thank you.
Your Honor.
Mr. Lomax we can break for lunch now or you can do a stop and start.
If it's a choice, I'll go now.
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.
Proceed.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
I know you've spent all morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk.
I know you're hungry.
What I need to tell you won't take very long at all.
I don't like Alexander Cullen.
I don't think he's a nice person.
I don't expect you to like him.
He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives.
He's been a destructive force in the lives of his stepchildren.
He's cheated the city, his partners... his employees.
He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines.
I don't like him.
I'm going to tell you some things during the course of this trial... that are going to make you like him even less.
But this isn't a popularity contest.
It's a murder trial.
And the single most important provable fact of this proceeding... is that Alexander Cullen was somewhere else... when these horrible crimes took place.
Now, the State...
The State is going all out here.
They've got this whole team here... throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case.
I want one thing from you.
That's it.
One thing.
I want you to ask yourself:
"Is not liking this man..." reason enough...
"...to convict him of murder?"
Enjoy your lunch.
We'll talk again.
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me.
Listen to me like you've never listened to anyone before in your life.
I'm gonna bust my ass to make sure they hate you.
Because as long as you're boning Melissa, you're not home killing your wife.
Why didn't you say something before?
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.
Oh, you got it now?
- Hey. Kevin.
- Eddie.
Saw you go in.
What's up?
Congratulations.
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.
What are you talking about?
How the fuck does your name get on the firm's charter?
What?
It looks like it's been there for years.
So now you're a partner.
When did that happen?
You know, I still am the managing director of this firm.
You want my job, take me head on.
You backdoor me one more time... and I'll take your partnership papers and shove them down your throat!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone.
- Bullshit.
- You got a problem with documents... put together one of your late-night shredding sessions.
You think you're tough enough to run this firm?
Ha! Remember the Weaver Commission investigation?
Tell your mentor... the next time Weaver calls me, maybe I'll just... pick up the phone.
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.
He was going running.
What the hell was he talking about?
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.
Why does he think I'm after his job?
You ever have any experience with manic depression?
- Not directly, no.
- You do now.
- It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.
He may be out running, so you might have to page him.
- It's an emergency.
- Yes, sir.
You look like you could use a drink.
Yes. Yes, thanks.
Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon. Ha.
I nursed him through two divorces, a cocaine rehab... and a pregnant receptionist.
Ha. God's creature, right?
God's special creature?
I've warned him, Kevin.
I've warned him every step of the way.
Watching him bounce around like a fucking game.
Like a wind-up toy.
Like 250 pounds... of self-serving greed on wheels.
The next thousand years is right around the corner, Kevin.
Eddie Barzoon.
- Take a good look because...
- Excuse me.
He's the poster child for the next millennium.
These people, it's no mystery where they come from.
You sharpen the human appetite... to the point where it can split atoms with its desire.
You build egos the size of cathedrals.
Fiber-optically connect the world to every eager impulse.
Grease even the dullest dreams with these dollar-green... gold-plated fantasies until every human becomes an aspiring emperor... becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?
- Hey. Wrong way.
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you...
As we're scrambling... from one deal to the next, who's got his eye on the planet?
As the air thickens, the water sours... even bees' honey takes on the metallic taste of radioactivity... and it just keeps coming, faster and faster.
Oh, fuck! Help! Stop it!
There's no chance to think, to prepare.
It's buy futures, sell futures... when there is no future.
We got a runaway train, boy.
We got a billion Eddie Barzoons all jogging into the future.
Every one of them is getting ready to fistfuck God's ex-planet... lick their fingers clean... as they reach out toward their pristine, cybernetic keyboards... to tote up their fucking billable hours.
And then it hits home.
You gotta pay your own way, Eddie.
A little late in the game to buy out now.
Give me your watch.
What? I like this watch.
Do you think you're just going to take it?
Your belly's too full, your dick is sore... your eyes are bloodshot and you're screaming for someone to help.
But guess what? There's no one there.
You're all alone, Eddie.
You're God's special little creature.
No.
Maybe it's true.
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.
Maybe he let us all down.
You testified the defendant called you at 4:30... to ask you to come to his office gym for the purposes of sex.
Yes.
Mr. Cullen, though, he's not just your lover, is he?
He's the boss.
Yes.
So two hours go by before you act on his request?
Yes, I went up at 6: 10.
I knew it was 6:10 because I heard the weather coming on the news...
Okay, stop.
This prosecutor is no fool.
He's going to change tempo, attitude, tone of voice.
He's going to come out with questions you never thought of just to screw you up.
So, what do we do?
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.
Exactly.
Is it your testimony, Ms. Black, that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40... you were engaged in sexual congress with the defendant?
Yes.
At any point during this three-hour marathon... did you lose sight of the defendant?
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?
- You understand the question?
- Yeah.
So is he cut or not?
Yes.
Which is it?
You've polished his knob three times a week for six months.
- You don't know if he has foreskin?
- I've had enough of your fucking game!
Why don't you take your questions and shove them up your ass?
Kevin.
What's happening?
- It's Eddie Barzoon.
- What about him?
He's dead. He was killed.
- When?
- Last night. In the park.
He was running, if you can believe it.
What is wrong with people?
At least they got the scumbags who did it.
Who?
Two old homeless crazies.
Kevin. I'm sorry, you're due in court in 30 minutes.
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished here or what?
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.
You've got to deal with Cullen.
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.
I can't put her on the stand.
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying.
She's lying because she didn't answer you fast enough? She lied to you? No.
She said nothing.
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.
He killed those people.
You really believe that?
He set me up.
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa, the whole thing.
I know it.
Gotta go with your gut.
That's your advice?
I'll back you either way.
Maybe it's your time to lose.
Think I haven't lost before?
Kevin.
We talked about this, remember?
Pressure.
Take a big whiff.
All rise.
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.
Please be seated.
All right, Mr. Lomax, you may present your case.
Mr. Lomax.
I call Melissa Black.
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth...
- So help you God?
- I do.
Kevin!
I have maintained my innocence all along, now you see proof.
Feeney, it's him.
She didn't look well.
Felix tried to talk to her.
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.
Honey.
Mar, it's me.
What happened?
Are you okay?
He let himself in. You need to know that.
Who let himself in?
The bath was running or something.
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.
And then we talked.
And we talked for hours.
And I haven't talked to anyone... really talked to anyone in so long.
Did somebody hurt you?
Yeah.
Who?
Milton.
What?
He...
He...
He fucked me.
And I think I wanted him to, but then I just...
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.
He just wouldn't stop.
When?
- Baby, when?
- Today.
The whole afternoon.
I'm so ashamed.
Today?
Yeah.
Today?
Today he was in court.
He was in court in my presence all afternoon!
- No!
- Yes!
Yes! Yes!
No.
God, no, Kevin.
Kevin, I'm not crazy.
You have to believe me.
- No!
- Oh, Jesus.
He did this to me!
No!
He did this to me.
What did you do to yourself?
What are we going to do, baby?
What am I going to do?
Sign there. And your relationship.
She's calm now. This might be a good time to say good night to her.
I know why this is happening.
They want you to sleep.
It's the money.
Blood money.
We just drank it down, both of us.
We knew it.
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.
But you just kept on winning... every time.
I can't look at myself in the mirror.
I see a monster.
Don't do this, Kevin.
Please take me home.
Please don't do this.
I'm not crazy.
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?
- Alessandra, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Skylar.
We are here today... to remember Eddie Barzoon.
Isn't she lovely?
We have gathered here to seek shelter in our common grief.
To draw strength toward our tested faith.
So, what do they say? How's Mary Ann?
They don't know.
She's...
She's falling apart.
Hallucinations.
Milton...
It's bad.
Do you have room for one more?
Beloved father. Devoted husband.
Trusted friend.
Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.
All of these things.
And yet one thing more:
Child of God.
And it is to that Father that he now returns.
Eddie Barzoon... such a vibrant member of our community... has moved beyond us now.
He has entered... a new communion.
And for that it is a time of rejoicing.
God, who is our refuge and our strength.
God, who is that very present help... in time of trouble.
Therefore we will not fear... though the Earth should change... though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea... though its waters roar and foam... though the mountains tremble with its tumult.
We cannot fear too long... for Eddie Barzoon... has gone home.
Mr. Lomax?
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.
You don't know me, but Eddie mentioned your name.
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?
Staking out the funeral?
Looking for you, actually.
I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to my wife.
Just wanted to ask you, off the record.
I have a few questions about Eddie.
Milton, Chadwick, Waters is a little more than a law firm.
But I assumed you knew that.
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.
London, Kinshasa, Karachi:
Arms brokering, mostly.
Munzer-Dietch, in Berlin, Djakarta:
Chemical weapons and toxic waste.
Ivanco Limited, Moscow:
Money laundering for the eastern bloc.
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.
That firm sets up bank accounts for judges in South America.
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!
Now stay off my back!
This is a first-time last-time offer,
Kevin.
I'm learning about you.
I talked to some old friends in Florida this morning.
The Gettys case?
Eighth grade teacher?
They found him yesterday.
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl in the trunk of his car.
Is he all right? Get help!
Hey, Marie, do you want to go to the party?
- Come on.
- No.
Horace will be disappointed.
It's a birthday party. We can sing.
"Or indeed, His divine power..." has granted us all things pertaining to life and piety...
"...through the knowledge of Him who has called us..."
Kevin?
What are you doing here?
I came this morning.
I kept calling the house and getting no answer.
I need to talk to you.
We got her on the first flight up this morning.
Are you all right, Kevin?
I just...
I don't know.
Would you excuse us for a moment, please?
- Sure.
- Come on, Kevin.
How you doing, sweetie?
I know something that'll make you feel better.
There.
I shouldn't have left. I knew it.
I'll never forgive myself.
- There's nothing you could've done.
- Oh, I could've told you the truth.
About what?
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.
I was here in New York.
That night in the elevator, you never let me answer.
- What are you talking about?
- I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.
They had a restaurant downstairs where we ate almost every meal.
Wait. Stop.
Your father was a waiter in that restaurant.
My father?
Oh, this is great, Ma.
- Honey, please listen.
- Now?
You do this now?
Because, I mean, your timing, it's superb.
You wait 30 years, you fly up here, you pick today?
Kevin, honey, just...
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!
I need this...
Listen to me!
Kevin. Kevin.
Kevin.
Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.
Oh. Don't you look beautiful now.
Take a look and see.
It's all right, dear. Look.
- No.
- Go on, take a look.
See how beautiful you are?
See?
Get out!
What happened?
She attacked me.
Mary Ann. Mary Ann.
Open the door.
Open the door, Mar.
Mar? Open the door. Mar.
Mar? Come on, Mar.
It's okay. Open the door!
- No!
- Mar!
Come on!
Open the door!
Mar!
Open the door, Mar!
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, look at me!
Somebody! Help!
No! Mar!
Pam, get help!
Go!
Mar! Sweetheart!
- Mar, look at me!
- I love you.
No, no, no!
No!
Oh, God, Mar, what have you done?
What have you done?
We need a doctor in here!
We need a doctor!
Mar, Mar, Mar, please stay with me, Mar!
Stay with me, Mar!
Get Dr. Job in here now!
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!
Sir, off! Go!
Come on. Come on.
- Help her.
- Out of the way.
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!
Finish the story.
1966. You were in New York.
There's a waiter in a restaurant.
Finish the story.
He talked to me.
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home, someone takes an interest...
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.
Every meal, there he was at my ear and I was...
That last night he came to say goodbye... and I started crying.
And he told me:
Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.
I want to hear you say it.
- His face that night, I knew it was him.
- Say it.
You were so proud you'd just come to
New York and done this all on your own.
- Say it!
- I didn't have the heart to tell you.
- You wondered yourself. The money...
- Say it!
That apartment, the attention, everything out of nowhere.
Say it!
Milton, he's your... father.
He's your father.
Somehow he found us.
He tracked you down.
- No.
- He did.
He's always been there.
I know that now.
Watching.
Waiting.
Playing us like a game.
What do you mean?
I gotta go.
No, leave it alone. Stay here with me.
Forget about him. We can leave here.
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.
I can't do it.
You go home. You go home.
- Kevin.
- I have to go.
- I have to go.
- Wait.
I love you.
- There you are.
- Pam.
Look at you. You're terrified.
Not to worry.
He'll take away that fear.
You don't ever have to be frightened again.
Go on.
He's waiting for you.
Go.
You were right about one thing.
I have been watching.
Couldn't help myself.
Watching.
Waiting.
Holding my breath.
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.
I don't make things happen.
Doesn't work like that.
What'd you do to Mary Ann?
Free will. It's like butterfly wings.
Once touched, they never get off the ground.
No.
I only set the stage.
You pull your own strings.
What did you do to Mary Ann?
A gun? In here?
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?
Well... on a scale of one to 10...
10 being the most depraved act of sexual theater known to man... one being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomaxs'...
I'd say, not to be immodest...
Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.
Fuck you!
Oh. Oh. Oh. Got me!
Got me! Yes!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Step it up, son! Come on! That's good!
You got to hold on to that fury.
That's the last thing to go.
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
Who are you?
Never lost a case.
Why?
Why do you think?
Because you're so fucking good.
Yeah?
But why?
Because you're my father?
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"
"It was a nice run, Kev."
"Had to close out some day."
"Nobody wins them all."
What are you?
Oh.
I have so many names.
Satan.
Call me Dad.
Mary Ann, she knew it.
She knew it. She knew it, so you destroyed her.
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?
Oh, I hope you're kidding.
Mary Ann, you could have saved her anytime you liked.
All she wanted was love.
Hey, you were too busy.
That's a lie.
Mary Ann in New York?
Face it, you started looking to better-deal her the minute you got here.
That's not true.
You don't know what we had.
- You don't know anything about it.
- Hey, I'm on your side.
- You're a liar!
- No, hey... Kevin.
There's nothing out there for you.
Don't be such a fucking chump.
Stop deluding yourself.
I told you to take care of your wife.
What did I say?
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?
What did you do?
"You know what scares me, John?
I leave the case, she gets better and then I hate her for it."
Remember?
I know what you did.
You set me up.
Who told you to pull out all the stops on Gettys?
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.
And Moyez. The direction you took.
Popes, swamis, snake handlers, all feeding at the same trough.
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!
It was a test! Your test!
And Cullen. Knowing he was guilty.
Seeing those pictures.
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand.
You brought me in. You put me there.
You made her lie.
I don't do that, Kevin!
That day on the subway, what did I say to you?
What were my words to you?
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.
Lose? I don't lose!
I win!
I'm a lawyer! That's my job.
That's what I do.
I rest my case.
Vanity... is definitely my favorite sin.
Kevin, it's so basic.
Self-love.
The all-natural opiate.
You know, it's not that you didn't care for Mary Ann, Kevin... it's just that you were a little more involved with someone else.
Yourself.
You're right.
I did it all.
I let her go.
Aw, don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.
Believe me.
I...
I left her behind and just kept going.
You cannot keep punishing yourself,
Kevin.
It's awesome how far you've come.
I didn't make it easy.
Couldn't.
Not for you... or your sister.
Half-sister, to be exact.
Surprise.
Some scene, Kevin?
Don't let him scare you, eh?
Kevin, I've had so many children.
I've had so many disappointments.
Mistake after mistake.
And then there's you.
The two of you.
What do you want from me?
I want you to be yourself.
You know, I'll tell you, boy... guilt... it's like a bag of fucking bricks.
All you gotta do... is set it down.
Hey.
I know what you're going through.
I've been there.
Just come here. Come here.
Yeah. Let it go.
I can't do that.
Who are you carrying all those bricks for anyway?
God?
Is that it?
God?
I'll tell you... let me give you a little inside information about God.
God likes to watch.
He's a prankster.
Think about it.
He gives man... instincts.
He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does he do?
I swear, for his own amusement... his own private, cosmic gag reel... he sets the rules in opposition.
It's the goof of all time.
Look, but don't touch.
Touch, but don't taste.
Taste, but don't swallow.
And while you're jumping from one foot to the next, what is he doing?
He's laughing his sick fucking ass off!
He's a tightass!
He's a sadist!
He's an absentee landlord!
Worship that? Never!
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven, is that it?
Why not?
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began.
I've nurtured every sensation man has been inspired to have.
I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him.
Why? Because I never rejected him, in spite of all his imperfections.
I'm a fan of man!
I'm a humanist.
Maybe the last humanist.
Who, in their right mind...
Kevin, could possibly deny... the 20th century was entirely mine?
All of it, Kevin!
All of it!
Mine.
I'm peaking, Kevin.
It's my time now.
It's our time.
Anybody want a drink?
I'm having a drink.
This is some pitch, all this.
You must need me pretty bad.
What do you want?
Eddie was right.
I want you to take over the firm.
You... and your sister.
- Is that it?
- No.
She's ovulating...
- Right now.
- What?
Your vanity... is justified, Kevin.
Your seed... is the key to a new future.
Your son is going to sit at the head of all tables, my boy.
He's gonna set this whole thing free.
You want a child.
I want a family.
The Antichrist.
Whatever.
But I have to volunteer.
Free will, it is a bitch.
Kevin, I need a family.
I need help. I'm busy.
Millennium's coming, son.
Title fight. Round 20. Ha, ha.
I'm ready to work.
What do you say, kid?
What're you offering?
Are we negotiating?
Always.
Yes.
What are you offering?
Everything.
Anything.
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?
Instant bliss. Bliss on tap. Ha, ha.
Bliss any way you want it.
How about that first line of cocaine?
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.
Familiar?
Oh, you're gonna have to do a little better than that.
I know.
I'm just getting warmed up.
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.
How about the thing you love the most?
A smile from a jury.
That cold courtroom just giving itself over... bending to your strength.
I get that on my own.
Not like this.
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.
I give you pleasure.
No strings!
Freedom, baby... is never having to say you're sorry.
This is revolution, Kevin.
It happened in Monterey
A long time ago
Forget about him.
This is about us.
In old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine
You don't know how hard it's been for me to wait for you.
Why the law?
Cut the shit, Dad. Why lawyers?
Why the law?
Because the law, my boy, puts us into everything.
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.
Did you know there are more students in law school... than lawyers walking the Earth?
We're coming out... guns blazing!
The two of you... all of us, acquittal after acquittal after acquittal... until the stench of it reaches so high and far into Heaven... it chokes the whole fucking lot of them.
In the Bible, you lose.
We're destined to lose, Dad.
Consider the source, son.
Besides... we'll write our own book.
Chapter one.
Right here. This altar.
This moment.
Will you stop talking?
You talk too much.
Both of you.
Kevin.
Look at me.
Just look at me.
Oh. She is really stunning.
Who am I?
I've wanted you from the moment we met.
The virtue of the devil is in his loins.
What about love?
Overrated.
Biochemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate.
Hey. In two minutes you won't be thinking about Mary Ann ever again.
Come here.
She's right, my son.
It's time to step up and take what's yours.
You're right.
It's time.
Free will, right?
No!
- No!
- No!
No!
Damn you!
Enough!
Haven't I given enough?
It was a nice run, Kev.
Had to close out someday.
Nobody wins them all.
What are you doing, baby?
Are you okay?
I am now.
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds presiding.
Please be seated.
You're still under oath, young lady.
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
Mr. Lomax?
Your Honor...
I'm terribly sorry.
But I can no longer represent my client.
I need to be replaced as counsel.
Order. Order! Order!
I adjourn this court.
This is outrageous. Are you aware of the consequences of this action?
I am, sir.
I want to see both attorneys in my chambers immediately.
I'm going to adjourn this trial until 9 a.m. Tomorrow morning.
I trusted you to defend me.
You swore you would. You'll burn for this.
You just made the biggest mistake of your life.
Baby, what are you doing?
The right thing.
I think the right thing.
Here they are.
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.
Ain't it better to talk to them all at once?
Press conference tomorrow?
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.
That's it.
This is the story you dreamed about.
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge.
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.
- Wait a second. Can they do that?
- Not when I get through with the story.
You got to give me an exclusive.
This is wire service. This is 60 Minutes.
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.
You're a star.
Baby.
Call me in the morning.
You got it. First thing.
Bye, Larry.
Vanity.
Definitely my favorite sin.
I want a drink.
I want a drink all the time.
Sometimes I wake up in the morning, my eyes pop open... and I think,
I got to have a drink... beer, bloody mary, whatever.
Even now, and I don't know why.
I haven't had a drink in three years.
- Three years, huh?
- Yeah.
Sometimes I'll be talking with my wife... and the whole time we're talking...
I'm thinking about this bar
I used to go to.
The whole conversation,
I'm thinking...
I'd rather be in that bar than anywhere.
The glasses all lined up... my seat right on the corner... all those colored bottles... the ice in my glass, that burn.
Man, it felt real good going down.
That'll never happen again.
I can't drink. I know that.
Drinking fucked up my whole life.
Excuse me, Father. I'm sorry.
That's all right, Dave.
How is your wife?
How's Annie?
You love your wife, don't you?
You have a good life now since you left the police department.
Yes, I do.
And if you begin drinking again... what will happen?
I would lose everything.
But knowing this... knowing that you would lose everything... you would lose your wife... your business, and your self-respect... still you want to drink?
Yes, I do.
You're absolved of your sins.
Go in peace.
- What you got there?
- Lunch.
What's for lunch?
What do you want?
Let's get the air mattress out of the locker.
What if one of the reels goes out?
You'll never notice.
There's a plane.
So wave.
No, no, no, no, no.
Look. It's in trouble.
- Jesus.
- Oh, God.
You take the wheel right now.
Coast guard New Orleans... this is Whiskey, Alpha, Bravo
4-7-2-7. Come in. Over.
Coast guard, New Orleans.
Come in.
We've got a small twin-engine plane crash... one mile due north of the southwest pass.
- Over.
- What's its status?
It's sinking. In need of immediate assistance. Over.
On our way.
Dave, we didn't refill the air tanks last time.
There's still some in there.
Not more than twenty-five feet here... if they haven't settled into the silt.
I think I can get the door open.
It's deeper than twenty-five feet. You know it is.
There's a trench running right through the pass.
Dave!
Hang outside in case one of them... comes up underneath the boat.
Come on.
Dave.
Grab her.
Hand her to me.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Come on. Oh, baby.
All right, now.
What's the little girl's name?
I'm sorry?
Her name.
Alafair.
Is she your daughter?
That's right.
I'll go look in on her for you.
In the meantime, why don't you look over that information... and make sure that
I wrote it down accurately.
Alafair?
That was your mother's name.
She's probably an illegal, anyway.
We wouldn't want to make problems... for the nuns, now, would we?
What if she is an illegal?
Immigration is gonna send her right back.
My, what an interesting family you have.
Did you know your daughter speaks nothing but Spanish?
Huh.
She told me that her father and her uncle... were killed by soldiers in El Salvador.
She said that a priest was bringing her... and her mother to America... when the plane caught fire and crashed into the water.
Is she going to be all right, sister?
She's fine.
What she needs now is someone to care for her.
I'll get her.
Oh, honey, it's all right.
It's all right.
You're just having a dream.
It's OK.
Donde esta mi mama?
That's where your mother is.
Cielo?
Up in the sky.
En el cielo. In heaven.
En el cielo.
You come with me, little guy.
I want you to light a candle.
Por su mama.
Yeah.
Can I help you?
Minos Dautrieve.
Drug enforcement administration.
Who did you expect?
Immigration, maybe?
Well, I'd invite you in,
Mr. Dautrieve... but I got to go to work.
That's all right.
I just wanted to ask you... one or two things about the plane crash.
Like what?
Like, why didn't you all wait for the coast guard... after you called in on the emergency channel?
My wife gave them the position.
They could see the oil and the gas on the water.
No need for us to stick around, was there?
Hey, do I know you?
I don't think so.
- Huh.
- See, I got this problem.
A diver found a suitcase... with a bunch of child's clothes in it.
Little girl's, in fact... but there wasn't a kid on that plane.
Now, what does that suggest to you?
Since when does the DEA care about some little kid?
Actually, it's the other three
I'm worried about.
Three?
What do you mean, three?
Two women and the priest.
What about the guy in the pink shirt... the one with the tattoo?
What guy in what pink shirt?
Well, there were four adults on that plane.
From what I hear, it's kind of murky down there.
Maybe you only thought you saw four people.
I read your file, Robicheaux.
Tell me, did you really do all that shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You smoked three guys when you were on the New Orleans PD.
One of them was a government witness.
He was a pimp and a drug dealer... and he dealt to play when he drew down on me and my partner.
Yeah?
Is that when they asked you to retire from the force?
Hey, wait a minute.
I do know you.
You were that point guard at LSU about fifteen years ago.
Downtown Dautrieve.
You were all-American or something, am I right?
- Honorable mention.
- Yeah.
Well, I guess I wasted my time coming out here... you a model citizen and all.
So, uh...
I know y'all gonna forget about meddling in DEA business...
'cause I don't want to have to come back out here... bring immigration with me.
Maybe take something you were planning on hanging onto.
Hey.
Can't stop being a homicide detective, can you?
Boy, that DEA agent really got under your skin.
He was trying to give me some sort of shuck... about one of the people on the plane.
Hey, that pilot was a priest probably just muling illegals.
Nothing new about that... certainly nothing the DEA should care about anyway... but the guy with the tattoo... they want me to try to pretend
I never saw him.
It sounds like good advice to me.
Thing is, I think that whoever blew up that plane... was trying to smoke that guy.
And we weren't supposed to see it.
What about Alafair?
Well, that's what's bothering me.
Whoever took out that plane... wasn't counting on anyone else being on board.
They certainly weren't counting on anyone surviving.
You think someone might come after her?
I think I need to find out more about the guy in that plane.
Dave. Dave, Dave.
I'd throw it all right back in the water, me.
It's nobody's business, Dave.
Nobody's.
- Is Robin around?
- Yeah. She's on next.
Hey, customers aren't allowed back there.
I'm not a customer.
Fuck off, Jerry.
Hey.
They put the first team back on the street?
How are you doing, Streak?
I heard you were back on the bayou... selling worms and all that jazz.
That's right.
I'm just a tourist here now.
You really hung it up for good?
- That's right.
- That must take guts... just to boogie on out of it one day... and do something weird like sell bait.
What did you say,
"Sayonara, crime-stoppers?
"Keep your guns in your pants."
- Something like that, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
Although I am in town to find out about a guy.
I think he might have come in here.
I'm not exactly an information center, Streak.
A lot of guys come in here.
Well, this one you definitely would remember.
A big dark guy with a head the size of a watermelon... and a tattoo of a green-and-red snake on his chest.
Now, why would I get to see it?
Here comes the bride.
Robin, you're not dropping the dime on anybody...
'cause the guy's already dead.
He was killed in a plane crash with some illegals and a priest.
The only survivor was a little girl.
And Annie and I are just trying to find out... everything about her that we can.
Annie.
How is Annie?
She and I really ought to get together one of these days.
Hey, Jerry, wake up.
The lady wants a drink. Give me a fresh orange slice this time.
I don't know what Johnny Dartez would be doing... with a priest and some illegals.
Who's Johnny Dartez?
A guy who runs drugs for Bubba.
For Bubba Rocque?
I know you, right? You're a cop.
Nope.
Now, come on, man.
I got two big talents.
One is as a mixologist, the other's for faces.
I'm no cop.
Maybe not anymore.
Don't you remember me?
It's Jerry something-or-other, right?
You went up the road about five years ago... for bashing in some tired, wheezing... broken-down old man with a lead pipe.
Ain't that right, Jerry?
How was Angola, brother?
Can I buy you a drink, lieutenant?
As I recall, you used to get kind of thirsty... about this time of day.
Hey, you're getting in my face, partner.
So?
So right about now
I'm thinking... your head would make a real nice toilet brush.
I ain't no swinging dick.
I know better than to fuck with the wrong people.
Don't I, Robin?
He ain't no swinging dick.
Hey, listen, you didn't hear anything from me, all right?
Bubba's crazy, Dave.
I've known Bubba my whole life.
There's nothing you can tell me about him... that I haven't heard before.
Take care now, darling.
Oh, Dave, you remember that man, rent from us this morning... the one talk funny, not from around here, no?
No, I don't, but what about him?
He run the boat up on the bar and bust off the propeller.
- You want me to go get him?
- No.
- I'll go. Where is he?
- South of the four corners.
You ask him where he come from... he don't know how to keep the boat on the bayou, no.
What's the trouble, partner?
Batist says you ran over a sandbar.
Let's have a look.
Nice and easy, motherfucker.
Don't look up, my friend.
That would change everything for us... and make things real bad for you.
Looks like it hurts.
Now, you can get out of this easy... or Toot could sculpt your ears over... and make your head look like a fucking mannequin.
He'd love to do it for you.
He was a voodoo priest or some fucking thing down in Haiti.
Tell him what you did to Robin, Toot.
You talk too much, get finished.
Want to eat.
- Guess what he did to her.
- Fuck you.
What?
You heard me. I said fuck you.
Whatever you do to me here,
I'm going to square.
And if I don't,
I got friends who will.
Yeah? I got news for you.
You're still breathing 'cause
I'm in a good fucking mood.
When you start talking to somebody else's whores... when you start poking your nose... into other people's shit, you got to pay the man.
That's the rules.
Old time homicide roach ought to know that.
Hey, Robin got off easy.
Put her finger in the door, broke it for her.
Come on, man. I'm hungry.
All right, I'm going to wrap this up for you...
'cause you're starting to remind me... of a dog down there.
You got a house.
You got a boat business.
You got a wife. You got a lot to be thankful for.
So don't get in nobody else's shit.
Now, we'll let the man pay his tab.
Not for nothing, Toot.
I could eat a little something.
Let's eat.
That's all you think about... that big, fat belly.
Hey.
Dave, let the sheriff handle it.
The sheriff?
For God's sakes, that guy is an ex-dry cleaner... who looks like a frito salesman.
What the hell is he going to do?
Jesus.
You look good, considering.
Minos Dautrieve.
The door was open.
I'm curious... why a bunch of moral retards who deal in dope and whores... are suddenly so interested in you.
How come you didn't want me to know...
Johnny Dartez was on that plane?
Was Dartez working for you?
He was.
Till he hitched a ride on that plane rigged with a bomb... and Bubba Rocque or somebody that worked for Bubba... blew him out of the sky.
Along with the other four fucks on that plane.
Look, all I know is I want Bubba off the board.
You're never going to do that by squeezing his people.
No? And how is it you have all this omniscient knowledge?
Hey, man, we grew up together.
I know Bubba Rocque.
We were in high school.
He was one of those guys who was eating light bulbs... and pushing thumb tacks into his kneecaps.
You know what?
I think you may have the delusion... you're still a police officer.
And I want you to drink it all up.
There you go.
I'm gonna go into New Orleans.
I'll be back tonight, all right?
You're supposed to be in bed.
Ever since that plane went down, the DEA has been here twice... and we've had our lives threatened.
Now, the sheriff is a real nice guy... who should be taking the stains out of people's clothes.
This situation is not gonna take care of itself.
I'm just going to go straighten this out.
What's happening, Streak?
Well, I'll tell you what's happening.
You are getting on a plane for Key West, Florida.
Hey, what am I going to do in Key West?
The boys down there would rather watch you dance.
You're going to go to work in a restaurant... owned by a friend of mine.
That's what you're gonna do.
One of your A.A. Pals?
I got enough troubles of my own without... getting my head shrunk by a bunch of ex-drunks.
Hey, this is a really nice restaurant.
A lot of famous people go there.
Tennessee Williams ate there one time.
Whoopee.
Listen, Dave...
I got plenty of fingers.
I'm sorry that happened.
That was my fault, and I'm very sorry about that.
Forget about it.
Comes with my stage career.
- Robin!
- Hey!
I think you're already there, baby doll.
Give me the damn thing.
No more bullshit.
I'm going to square what those two guys did to you and me... and when I do, you're not going to be welcome in New Orleans.
You understand me?
I got your plane ticket for you right here... and I got two hundred dollars for you.
Wow.
Just like the old Streak... riding in on a white horse to save little Robin again.
Should've been a priest or something.
My friend's name and number is right there on the envelope.
There you go.
Hey.
Would you stay just a minute, please?
I promise I'll get on the plane.
Just... sit me... sit with me just for a minute.
- Where's Jerry at?
- He's upstairs in the office.
God damn!
- Jesus Christ!
- Tell me... how much you make... for dropping that dime on Robin and me?
What? I didn't get nothing!
What the fuck you talking about?
Stay down, Jerry. You look real good with the carpet.
You're a fucking psycho.
A guy with the initials
E.L.K. Came to see me.
You know who that might be?
He's a fucking hit man.
He'll kill me.
He gonna have to get in line, partner.
Eddie Keats!
That must be who they sent.
Who's they?
Look, everybody does it.
You hear something about Bubba Rocque... or one of his people talking about him... or somebody getting out of line... you call up his club about it, you get a hundred bucks.
It don't even have to be important.
I'm going to have a little talk with Bubba Rocque, brother.
If I were you,
I'd find another zip code.
- Dave Robicheaux.
- Hey, Bubba.
I got your dreamsicle, hangin' down low.
What's that bull... what is that bullshit?
Hitting me in the head without a mouthpiece?
You lucky, man. You are lucky.
What are you drinking, Dave?
Nothing for me right now, thanks.
That's right. I heard you were fighting the hooch for a while.
- You winning?
- Yeah.
Good for you. I got some tea.
Here. Use the coaster for me, all right?
Clarence.
Mm-hmm! Beautiful.
Thank you, Clarence.
Hey, Bubba,
I got a little problem...
I thought you might be able to help me out with.
Name it.
A Haitian guy named Toot... somebody named Eddie Keats came to see me.
They left me with a couple of stitches in my head.
Bartender at Smiling Jack's said he sicked them on me... by calling one of your clubs.
They also hurt a friend of mine... and I wanted to take care of it.
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah.
What's the name of this motor-mouth at Smiling Jack's?
I already had a talk with him.
Look, Dave, I know Eddie Keats.
He does not work for me.
And from what I hear... he don't put stitches in people's heads, he smokes them.
And this boy Toot, he's some kind of psycho Zulu... likes to torture people, take pictures of it.
Forget these clowns. Good for nothing. Eat some shrimp.
I hear Johnny Dartez was working for the feds.
Did I make you nervous?
Hey, Dave, you and me, we got history, right?
I mean, we go way back.
I know you.
Hell, you know me.
How do you think
I have this house... and all the business I got?
'Cause I run scared every time some no-dick... like Minos Dautrieve and the DEA... with their thumb up their ass... selling that bullshit they can never prove?
I don't know, Bubba.
I don't know what you think.
Maybe if a person wants to find out... you just got to keep fucking in the same direction.
You know something, partner?
That's a two-way street.
Is that right?
Dave Robicheaux.
I can see in your baby-blue eyes... you would just love to take me.
Please, Mr. Robicheaux, hit him.
Dave, you remember Claudette from New Iberia.
I'm a little vague on people from back home sometimes.
A pleasure.
Well, I'll bet you remember her mama... Patty Fontaneau.
I'll bet good cash money you lost your cherry... at one of her cribs on Railroad Avenue.
Bubba, fix me a gin rickey.
Thermos in the icebox, baby.
I'd like one in a glass, please.
You know, Dave, this broad can drink gin rickeys... all day long and not get loaded.
I think she got a hollow heinie.
I don't think Dave is used to our kind of talk.
He's married, too, isn't he?
Claudette, honey, come here.
Baby, I don't want to get on your ass all the time... but do you think it's possible that you could put a coaster... under this goddamn thermos once in a while?
I got rings on the bar,
I got rings on the table.
I got rings all over the motherfucking house.
And look... a stack of coasters.
Hey, I got to be running.
I'll see y'all later.
OK, Dave,
I'll make some phone calls.
I'll see if I can't find this Eddie Keats.
In the meantime, anybody gives you any problems...
I cancel their act.
Hey... give me a hug.
Yeah.
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.
I'll walk you out.
Eddie Keats owns a club out on the Pearl Highway... called the Jungle Room.
Did you like my butterfly?
I didn't notice it.
Sure, you did.
Stay here.
Can I help you?
Lovely little girl.
Go back inside, honey.
I think you better leave.
Tell your husband Victor Romero stopped by to say hello.
- Hey, Sammy.
- What's up, pal?
Hey, how you doing there, kids?
Come here.
Come here, you little fuck.
What do you think, my friend, looking for a little taste?
- What do you think, Sammy?
- White, black, or yellow?
My good friend Robicheaux.
You miss me?
Goddamn!
You were gone a long time.
Did you take care of everything?
I found one of those guys that roughed me up.
Went over to his place, had a chat with him.
What? What does that mean?
What's the matter?
- Victor Romero says hello.
- Who?
I don't know.
Some guy came by today.
- Somebody came here?
- Yeah.
Don't worry. I took care of it.
What... hey, hey, hey, hey.
Did the guy say what he wanted?
What he wanted was to scare the shit... out of me and Alafair, and that's exactly what he did.
What did the guy look like?
He looked like a big bad guy, Dave.
Jesus.
So, is this the way it's going to be?
We can't have kids of our own... and now I'm here with a child pretending we have a family?
What the hell do you think
I'm doing all this for?
I'm out there protecting that family.
Hey, Dave, bullshit.
You're not a cop anymore.
We gave all that up, remember?
What do you mean, we?
I had to live through it, too.
And I won't do it again, Dave.
I can't.
Well, what is that now?
Is that some kind of a threat?
Read it how you want.
What'll it be, Dave?
When a young man such as yourself reaches out to me...
I take it serious, Bubba.
I invite you and your lovely wife to New Orleans.
We talk... work some things out.
I see an opportunity to do some business.
You wanted to move into New Orleans... and I wanted a piece of northern Louisiana.
I go home, tell my people... that I think this young man has some juice.
The next thing I know... you're blowing up airplanes full of people.
Calling a lot of unnecessary attention to your business.
So what I'm wondering now is... did I make a mistake in my previous assessment of you?
The guy on the plane...
Johnny Dartez... was working for the feds.
And I didn't know Dartez was running wetbacks on the side.
Fine. You turn him off... but you do it with a little discretion.
A little fucking precision, for Christ's sake.
I mean, even Tony and Dom there... when they blow out a guy's candle... they don't kill women and children along the way.
There is no problem,
Mr. Giancano.
I hear Dave Robicheaux came to see you.
Dave and I grew up together.
He ain't gonna be a problem unless we make him one.
I know Dave Robicheaux, too.
And for a long time, the man's been... a massive fucking migraine to all of us in New Orleans.
I'll also bet you that barn you call a house... that he made your boy Dartez on that plane.
Which makes you responsible for any future grief... the man may cause.
Dave is cool.
A few years back, he bottled out... and moved to the swamp to sleep it off.
He don't want any part of this shit.
The man may have been asleep... but that was before you crashed an airplane... on top of his fucking head and woke him up.
Guys like that, you wake them up... they don't go back to sleep so easy.
Not without help, anyway.
Are you telling me that you don't think...
I know how to play a guy like Dave Robicheaux?
I'm just telling you the way it is.
You want to do business with me... you clean up your fucking act.
We will, Mr. Giancano.
Oh, and, Bubba.
Tony and Dom will be checking in on you from time to time.
See what you're up to.
You don't have any problem with that, do you?
No, not at all.
Come on, baby.
I went to Ti-neg's last night.
Then I went out to Sycamore Point... and sat on the dock all night... thinking about what an asshole
I've been lately.
You didn't drink?
No, I did not.
Look, Dave, if you want to go back to the first district... maybe we should think about it.
No, no.
Why not? Because you don't think I could handle it?
No.
Because I don't want you to handle it.
You and me... that's the only thing
I have in my whole life... that means anything to me anymore.
Please don't let me mess that up.
I won't.
I'm over here!
Dave?
Annie!
- He's out here!
- Go!
You're going to be all right, doll.
You're going to be all right.
I promise.
I promise.
I love you.
Dave.
Hey, man, you got to help me.
You got to take her to the hospital for me.
I know if I set out after them right now...
I'll be able to catch them.
We got to get her to the hospital.
I'm gonna jump in the boat.
I know where I can get them, but you got to hurry up... and get over there with her right now.
- Go as soon as you can.
- Dave.
Make sure you put a coat on her... because she felt kind of cold to me.
Annie already gone, Dave.
She gone.
She gone?
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Alafair.
Oh, Alafair.
Alafair, you all right?
You all right?
Batist here. Come to Batist.
Come to Batist. Come to Batist.
Oh, honey... you ain't got to be scared no more.
It going to be all right.
It going to be all right.
Batist going to take good care of you, you'll see.
That's right.
It's all right you cry.
It's all right to cry. Mm-hmm.
The truck over here now.
We got supper already fixed.
You ain't eat nothing all day.
We got to take her folks back to the motel.
They already left.
You put this coat on now.
You want to stand out here and be a duck?
Come on, now. Come on, let's go.
Jesus.
Feed ducks with Annie?
Hey. Hey.
You just having a bad dream, little guy.
You got to go back into bed.
Donde esta Annie?
Well... she's gone away.
She...
You got to go to bed now.
Good luck out there, you.
I'm going to take an outboard down the bayou.
You should close up in a couple of hours.
You hear me?
Uh-huh. I heard you.
I'll watch Alafair, too.
Yeah, you do that.
Evening, Mrs. Rocque.
Well, Mr. Robicheaux... last time I saw you, you were on your way over here.
You must like it.
It's a real swinging place.
Where's your husband?
In Houston, on business.
Well, how nice for you.
And maybe for you, too.
Hey, baby, what's with the Vitalis twins?
Tony and Dom are friends of mine from New Orleans.
You care to join us for a drink?
No.
Well, if you change your mind...
I was very sorry to hear about your wife.
You a tough guy?
Hey, I got something for you.
What's that?
I got your dreamsicle hangin' down low, partner.
Are you saying fuck you to me?
No.
I'm saying fuck you, fuck your mother... and fuck your dog.
Fuck!
Here's your dreamsicle now.
Pick him up.
Who are you talking to, you fucking...
Shit!
Drop the cuervo, partner... before I blow your shit all over the bar.
Breathing down there, Dave?
Uh-huh.
Let's all go have a little sit-down, shall we?
Jesus.
Any more lube in that coif of yours, Po-jo... your hair's going to start breaking off in the comb.
Honey, get them all another round... and bring me a diet coke, would you?
Well, well, well... now, isn't this nice?
Although, I got to wonder... what Bubba would make of two low-level wop dog-dicks... sitting here having highballs with his wife.
Huh, Dave?
Minos... why don't you put that piece away... for a few minutes and come outside?
I'm not that kind of guy, Dom.
Ow! I love this song.
You want to dance, Miss Rocque?
On second thought, I better not.
I got to take my friend Dave home.
Seems he's had himself one fucker of a night.
Y'all tell Bubba I said hey.
I told him to get out of there.
- I didn't know...
- Oh, yes, he was.
I'm looking for a guy named Toot.
You know anybody named Toot lives in this neighborhood?
Yeah, I know Toot. Stays above the hardware store on Josephine.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, right.
Jesus Christ, how we supposed to get this up there?
It's a four-man job.
They only ordered two men.
It's way too long,
I'm telling you.
Shit.
Drop it, Toot, or I'm going to park one... in the back of your fucking head.
Toot, what happened to your door?
Come on, Bobby. Two more steps, and we're going home.
On three here.
Bobby, get it off the railing.
You're going to scratch it.
Now, ease in there.
Please sit down.
It's your play, Toot.
- Shoot that fucker!
- Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him! Kill the asshole!
Pontiac catalina. Huh.
Had one of these, same color... a convertible.
Somebody's going to steal them shoes.
You're a long way from New Iberia, Dave.
The man was involved in a murder.
You go to his apartment, you're gonna find a shotgun there.
The sheriff's going to want to have that as evidence.
Hey. Hey.
Look, the captain's going to want a statement.
And there may be more, depending on his blood pressure.
When you get through here...
I'll follow you down to the first district.
Dave. Dave.
Who'd that bedbug kill?
He killed my wife.
OK, now.
Come back before dark now, OK?
All right.
Hold on, honey.
Whoo!
Wow, this is really out among the pelicans and the alligators.
Robin, is that you?
Ask me after I'm sure
I'm back on planet earth.
I had to fly one of those shitty little airlines... where the pilot's got a three-day-growth of beard... and blows garlic and
Boone's Farm all over the place.
We were dropping through air pockets so fast...
I thought
I was gonna toss my cookies.
Robin, what are you doing here?
Well, now...
Oh, my God.
You said you had a little girl... but you never said she was perfect.
Hi there, sweetie.
What's her name?
Alafair.
Alafair, honey, this is Robin.
Hi. Hola!
Want to show me your house?
Your casa?
Come on.
What happened in Key West,
Robin?
One of the bartenders found out
I used to s-t-r-i-p... and he made a move on me one day during happy hour.
But it's not worth talking about.
This is really a nice place.
So, what did you do to him?
Let's find your room.
Robin.
That doesn't look like your room.
Robin.
Oh, this is your room.
Is this your monkey?
Robin, what did you do to him?
Well...
I broke a bottle of grenadine across his face.
But it wasn't that bad.
It looked worse than it was... on account of the cherry juice and all.
This is the guest room.
Am I right?
You know, you say bayou, and I think... the swamp and nets and shit hanging... but this is... this is really nice.
Why don't you, me, and Alfie here... go on out to that dock and have ourselves a soda?
So, can I say something?
You're not going to take it the wrong way...
I mean, 'cause I mean this in the nicest possible way.
I just don't want you to think that I came up here... to try and straighten you out...
'cause you are who you are.
I'm cool with that.
I just think that at some point... you're going to have to decide... who it is you want to be for the rest of your life.
If you want to be a pissed-off guy... trying to right every wrong that's ever been done to him... or you want to be alive.
Hey... either way, Streak...
I'm your biggest fan.
Good night.
- Hello?
- Dave, please help me.
Annie!
- It's all right.
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's all right.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I'm here, I'm here.
- Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Robin, I was talking with Annie on the phone.
No, no, no, you were just dreaming.
- Oh, Jesus.
- You were just dreaming, baby.
- Oh, I got to go get a drink.
- No, no, no, no.
No, no.
I got to get a drink, baby.
No, no, it's not happening, OK?
Just lie down with me, OK?
Lie with me.
There, there, there, there, there.
That's better. That's better.
That's better.
Who belongs to that?
Bubba's wife.
Hey there, Mrs. Rocque.
I had a flat tire.
Can you give me a ride back to my aunt's?
Yes, I can... or I could change that tire for you.
There's no air in the spare, either.
What a lovely little girl.
Hello.
Claudette Rocque, this is my friend Robin.
She's going to be staying with us for a while.
Oh.
Have me met?
Not formally.
You're a performer of some kind.
Oh, that's right. You work at that little place on Bourbon...
Smiling Jack's.
That's right.
Now I remember you, too.
You came in one time with a couple of real pretty girls... asked me to work a private slumber party.
But I don't really go in for that sort of thing.
I think you got me mixed up with someone else.
Well, maybe you're right.
The girl I'm talking about was real trash.
She had a butterfly tattoo on her belly.
Well, anyway, it was real nice to meet you, Claudia.
Come on, sweetie.
Well, she's enchanting.
Nice to see you back in the swing of things.
What brings you out this way,
Mrs. Rocque?
It's Claudette, Dave.
My cousin lives down at the end of the road.
I come over to New Iberia about once a month... to see my relatives.
- I see.
- Am I putting you out?
No. Just give me a minute.
Wait for me in the truck.
You look uncomfortable.
I didn't get very much sleep last night.
Would you like a gin rickey?
Not for me, thank you.
I gave it up for a while, almost a year.
Then people started telling me they liked me better drunk.
Anyone ever say that to you, Dave?
Hey, let me ask you something... what do you think the odds are... of you having a flat tire right by my front lane?
Now the good detective is wondering what the lady wants.
Take a look.
We had a little argument.
Apparently I fell.
At least that's what
Bubba said when I came to.
I'm pretty sure one of my ribs is cracked.
What do you think?
I think... you should see a doctor.
Don't you want to know what we fought about?
That's none of my business.
We fought about you.
You're not afraid of Bubba.
You know he's not really so tough.
I know you shouldn't jerk him around.
I know that if you mess with his pride... you're going to meet the guy... that wheeled his crippled cousin into the coolie.
Hadn't heard that one before.
I know one thing
Bubba's afraid of.
And what's that?
Bubba's never done time.
I don't think he could. I don't think he'd last three days.
I believe he would do anything to stay out of the joint.
He has nightmares about it.
He's been having a lot of them since that plane went down.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
I'll get out here.
Say, Dave... you ever get bored of the stripper's act, come on by.
How you hangin', Streak?
That's some boat you got.
Hell, take a ride with us.
This baby can eat a trench all the way across the lake.
What are you doing with these people?
Friends from New Orleans.
You want a beer?
How deep is the mob into you,
Bubba?
You got to be paying those guys big dues, huh?
Hey, you got it wrong, Dave.
People pay me dues.
I win, they lose.
Now, you want a beer or not?
- Toot's dead.
- Is that right?
I want those other two men that killed my wife.
I had nothing to do with that,
Dave.
When I want to straighten out a problem... a person's going to see this face.
They were your people.
I'm going to tell you something... and I'm going to tell you only once... now, you can accept it, or you can stick it up your ass...
I am one guy.
I am not a crime wave. And when you mess with the action... out of New Orleans, you fuck with hundreds of people.
Do you understand,
Dave Robicheaux?
My wife had to be buried in a closed casket.
I want you to think about that for a minute.
Now, I'm going to find those two men... and when I do, I'm going to squeeze them extra hard... and if your name comes out of either one of their mouths...
I'll be back here to feed your sorry fucking ass to the shrimp.
You wouldn't leave it alone,
Dave... so they closed the door on your nose.
Leave me out of your shit, Dave.
I'll tell you... this Dave Robicheaux makes me very uncomfortable.
You tell me he's not a problem.
Next thing I know, you go out and kill the man's wife.
What the fuck is that?
Now my people tell me...
Robicheaux smoked one of the shooters on the streetcar... which would explain why Eddie Keats... is calling me every 5 minutes asking for my protection.
It sounds like he's coming apart... like he might be a problem.
What the fuck is going on?
I'm taking care of it.
You're taking care of it?
That's right.
So, on top of everything else... your husband doesn't even show me the proper respect... of coming in here to see me himself.
Instead, he sends his wife.
No one sent me.
Bubba doesn't know I'm here.
Really?
Bubba's not well.
What the hell does that mean?
Unhappy childhood and all that.
From now on, you need to talk...
I'll be the one listening.
And why should I trust you?
The daughter of some whore.
I learned a lot from my mother.
She was a good businesswoman.
I'm asking for a second chance... to prove to you
I can handle things...
Eddie Keats, Dave Robicheaux, my husband.
And this time, Mr. Giancano...
I promise you, you won't be disappointed.
Yeah?
N.O.P.D. Tells me our friend Toot had a bad day.
They're saying he missed the bus.
Well, that's very clever, Minos.
Say, you busy right now?
Why?
Eddie Keats wants to say hey.
I saw one like this once before... back when I worked homicide in Atlanta.
This must've been a real son of a bitch.
You see this, this white stuff underneath his fingernails?
This guy actually tried to claw the paint off this bathtub.
So, how come you haven't called the sheriff yet?
I thought you might want to have a look... before they come along, messed up the crime scene.
That's real considerate of you,
Minos... but I'd prefer if you'd cut the cute act.
I figure you brought me down here... to get my reaction to this to see if I was the guy... that threw that radio into that bathtub. Am I right?
Did you?
I wish I had.
You know a guy named
Victor Romero?
Why you want to know?
He came by the house right before it happened.
He tried to shake Annie's tree.
And you think he's the third guy?
Dave... let me give you some advice
I know you won't take.
Forget about Romero.
Now, I don't know his resume by heart... but you are talking about a true genetic fuck-up... who gets off on hurting people.
And I'd sure hate to see you or those close to you... get hurt any more than they already have.
Did you hear what happened to Eddie?
I heard he had a real nice service.
They cremated him... put him in a vase or something.
I got up too late to go.
What about Victor Romero?
You seen him lately?
I don't know that person.
You fucking my wife, Dave?
Come on, Dave, get up.
I ain't through.
Hey, Bubba, you want to go to the hospital?
No, I don't want to go to no hospital.
Hey, tell me something...
I really shook your peaches with that first shot, didn't I?
Yeah.
- Let me ask you something.
- Huh?
What makes you think I was messing around with Claudette?
Cuervo gold.
Well, she said she was in the truck with you.
And I know she knows how to get a guy on the bone.
Hey, man, you're talking about your wife.
Hey, she's human.
You know something, Bubba?
I got a strange suspicion... that you're a man without a future.
Yeah?
Why is that?
Well, I mean... you're in the backyard sparring with the featherweights... trying to be 16 years old again, and one of these days... somebody's going to come along and take it all away from you.
Hey, Dave... nobody is going to cool out my action.
But it's real nice of you to worry.
Take it easy.
What are you doing in here?
I couldn't find your keys... so I had to pry the lock off with a screwdriver.
I'm sorry about the damage to the door.
I want you to get out of this room.
What is this, like your church... where you come every day to suffer?
That's none of your damn business, what this room is.
That's not a part of your life.
You know what I think?
I think she wouldn't expect you to be acting this way.
I think she'd be doing just what I'm doing now.
How would you know that?
I mean, you're not her.
How would you know that?
I'm finished.
Jerry got busted again.
Jerry Falgout... the bartender over at Smiling Jack's.
He was arrested up in Natchez... for stealing social security checks.
Pretty pathetic.
Robin, you and I ought to have a little talk.
Hello?
Bien, gracias.
Me Ilamo Alafair.
Yo soy de El Salvador.
Hey, hey, darling, let me have that.
Thank you. Thank you.
Can you get yourself ready for bed?
Hello?
Sweet girl.
Who is this?
This is Victor Romero.
I'll be in in a minute.
I'm hearing a lot of stuff
I don't like to hear.
Most of it's got your name on it.
You still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.
I hear you want to cut a slice out of my ass... like I'm responsible for every crime in Louisiana.
You saying I'm killing people on the airplanes and bathtubs... going around the quarter telling people...
I should be looking over my shoulder... before something heavy falls on me.
You there?
I'm listening.
So I'll tell you my deal.
The people I do business with are saying I'm too hot... like maybe
I won't be around next year... that this guy Robicheaux is a hard tail and don't play... so you're fucking me, man.
Hey, Victor, I really don't give a shit about your problems... so why don't you write all this down on a postcard... and maybe I'll read it if I get some free time.
There's a cello in the front room... and a fan in your bedroom and a telephone in your hall... except I tore it out the wall for you.
And while I did your old lady... you were outside hiding in the dark.
I'm gonna find you.
Kiss my ass.
If you don't get off my back,
Robicheaux...
I'm gonna kill the kid, the whore... and that old fuck you got working for you.
You want all that on a postcard, too?
You're going after him, aren't you?
Hey, Streak... you remember the time... you took me to midnight mass over at Saint Louis Cathedral?
And afterwards we walked across the square... and had beignets at the Cafe du Monde.
You remember that?
I remember.
I thought you were serious about me that night.
Robin...
I was just too messed up... to realize that all you wanted was to help me.
That's all you've ever wanted.
I just wish
I could return the favor.
Y'all let me know if you need anything, Dave.
Hey, thank you, Burgess.
You look like you could use a shower, Jerry.
Have you not been showering lately?
I'm floating around on an ice cube... that's melting in a fucking toilet.
That's a swell metaphor, Jerry, but I need a name.
- What do you want?
- Victor Romero.
Jesus, you've got a fucking obsession, man.
Look, I don't know where he is, and I don't want to know!
Give me a name, Jerry.
I ain't got any.
Look, I'm telling you the truth.
I've got no reason to cover for this cat.
You know why I'm after these people, don't you?
Hey, I had nothing to do with that.
Let me tell you something, man.
I'm going to find those people... and when I do, you gonna be real glad you in here.
I'll see you when you get out, partner.
He's got a cousin.
What's that? He's got a cousin?
So fucking what?
- I don't know the cat's name.
- Come on!
Romero brought him in the bar a couple times.
He had pulled a scam everybody was laughing about... counterfeit tuxedos... like they was Roberto Armani or some fucking thing.
Where's this cousin at now?
I don't know.
I only met him once or twice.
I think he used to run a laundry... in the quarter or something... called Juan's... or Jose's.
Who sent you?
What'd you say?
Well, hey there.
I was just about to go on up to bed.
Can I get you something to drink, Dave?
Yeah.
I'd like to have a gin rickey.
Where's your little thermos?
Hmm, my thermos is...
I guess your husband is not in charge anymore... is he, Mrs. Rocque?
Bubba was never in charge.
All that boxing macho bullshit.
The man's crazy as a fucking loon.
You really think he could actually run anything... for very long without fucking it up?
And all the while, you're playing the battered wife.
I am the battered wife.
You... sent those men to kill my wife, didn't you?
You bought the hit! Yes or no?
I bought the hit on you.
What are you going to do now, Dave?
You going to kill me?
Go on. Go on, do it.
Do it!
Come on, Dave.
Come on, blow me away... so you can go home to the whore and the kid... and pretend you're a good man.
Killing a hundred of you... wouldn't make up for one Annie.
It ain't in there, baby.
Bubba, what are you doing up?
911 emergency.
I'd like to report a shooting... at Bubba Rocque's house out on the river.
Your name, sir?
Your name?
Good luck, Bubba.

I have to tell you, Sparks...
...one thousand, one hundred and sixteen miles.
Pretty good. That's the farthest yet.

Don't tell me.
TED:

Hula-Hoops.

I don't think even the biggest radio could reach that far.
All right, no more stalling.
Okay.
Pensacola.
Oh, Ellie, that's a beauty.
Now get some sleep.

You had something there.

ELLIE: All right, 1221.46.
That's well within the L band.
- Check off-axis.
- Uh-huh. On it.
It's not in the neighborhood.
Ah.
Here it is. J-1741 plus 2748.
Catalogued November 4, 1982. Pulsar.
Well, I don't know, it must've been...
The glitch in the timing is what threw me.
Must've been a starquake.
[WHIRRING STOPS]
I think it's great that you listen.
Most people don't do that anymore.
It's just an old habit.
You know, it makes it feel more real.
- Ellie.
- Kent. Kent Clark.
Hey.
They said you've been up at Owens Valley working under Drumlin.
How did you like him?
[ELLIE SIGHS]
That much? And about what I'd expect after what he had to say about you.
What was that?
That you are brilliant, driven...
...a major pain in the ass, and obsessed with a field of study...
...that he considers tantamount to professional suicide.
- Anything else?
- Those were the highlights.
Davio, Dr. Vernon. Dr. Arroway.
ELLIE: Hey. Hi there.
- How you doing?
And I believe you've already met our tireless research assistant, Mr. Fisher...
- Here, I need you to sign...
...as well as his cologne.
Brook's looking at the black hole at the center of M-87.

I hear the locals, they call it El Radar.
Convinced it has some dark military purpose.
I think we're pretty harmless.
Palmer Joss.
- Ellie Arroway.
- Nice to meet you, Ellie.
What are you studying up there?
The usual.
You know. Nebulae, quasars, pulsars, stuff like that.
What are you...? What are you writing?
The usual. Nouns, adverbs, adjective here and there.
I work on a project called SETI.
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence?
Wow. Man, that is out there.
Wait, are you a student or something?
Mm-mm. I'm a writer. I'm writing a book.
Down here doing research about how technology affects Third World cultures.
I'm also looking for this guy
David Drumlin.
He's the new head of the National Science
Foundation. I'm trying to get an interview.
- I take it you know him?
- Mm-hm.
You could say that.
SETI, man. That's fringe.
I've crossed paths with this guy.
Something like that must really chap his ass, huh?
Compass.
For you, EI.
You better keep this.
Might save your life someday.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
I...
I don't make a very good research subject.
I'm just not very quotable.
No quotes. No quotes. Scout's honor.
Just a good meal, good company.
I gotta go.
But, uh...
Drumlirs coming in this Tuesday.
Now I remember why I took that desk job.
- Dr. Drumlin, how are you?
- Dr. Drumlin.
Glad you could make it, David.
If I'd known it was gonna take three planes, I might've reconsidered.
How is that new office?
I'm still settling in. They already wanna take half my budget and give it to the Pentagon.
Ellie. Still waiting for E.T. To call?
- Well, I understand we're having a little...
- Good to see you too.
Asshole.
Uh-oh. Looks like it's gonna be a long night.
Science must first be accountable to the people who are paying for it, the taxpayers.
We need to stop wasting money on pie-in-the-sky abstractions...
...and start spending it on practical, measurable ways...
...to improve the lives of the people who are footing the bill.
Not unlike my L-band, globular-clusters work.
Wait, you're saying you wanna do away with all pure research now?
What's wrong with science being practical?
Even profitable?
Nothing, as long as your motive is the search for truth.
Which is exactly what the pursuit of science is.
That's a rather interesting position...
...coming from a man on a crusade against the evils of technology...
...Father Joss.
PALMER:
I'm not against technology, doctor.
I'm against the men who deify it at the expense of human truth.
Kent, I've been meaning to have a word with you. Over here, please.
KENT:
Yeah, I'll just...
I think that hurt my chances with that interview. What do you think?
You're a priest?
No, not really.
I got my Masters in Divinity...
...then dropped out of seminary to do some secular humanitarian work...
...coordinating efforts for Third World churches.
I couldn't live with the whole celibacy thing.
You could...
You could call me a man of the cloth...
...without the cloth.
You wanna get out of here?
All right, you see that sort of large,
W-shaped constellation right there?
That's Cassiopeia.
And Cassiopeia A gives off a whole lot of radio signals.
I actually listen to them a lot.
It's a remnant of a supernova.
When did you know you wanted to be an astronomer?
Well, when I...
When I was about 8 years old,
I was watching the sunset...
...and I asked my dad,
"What's that bright star over there?"
Dad, what's that star there?
And he said that it wasrt really a star at all. It was actually...
That's not a star, it's a planet.
- A whole planet called Venus...
That's the planet Venus.
- Which should be over there soon.
He said,
"You know why they called it Venus?
Because they thought it was so beautiful and glowing.
But what they didn't know...
...is that it's filled with...
...deadly gases and sulfuric acid rain."
"Wow," I thought,
"This is it! I'm hooked."
You know, there are four hundred billion stars out there...
...just in our galaxy alone.
If only one out of a million of those had planets...
...all right, and ifjust one out of a million of those had life...
...and ifjust one out of a million of those had intelligent life...
...there would be literally millions of civilizations out there.
Well, if there wasrt...
...it'd be an awful waste of space.
Amen.
PALMER: So I was lying there, just looking at the sky.
And then I felt something. I don't know, I...
All I know is that I wasrt alone.
And for the first time in my life
I wasrt scared of nothing, you know?
Not even dying.
It was God.
And there's no chance that...
...you had this experience because some part of you needed to have it?
I mean, I'm a reasonably intelligent guy, but this...
No, this... No, my intellect, it couldn't even touch this.
No.
I've been to Sunday school a few times.
Uh-huh. And?
Well, I just kept asking all these really annoying questions like:
"All right, then where did Mrs. Cain come from?"
And pretty soon they called my dad and they asked him...
...if he wouldn't mind just keeping me home from now on.
Your dad...
- Is it this guy?
- Yeah.
You're close to him, aren't you?
Yeah, I was.
He died when I was 9 years old.
I never got to know my mother.
I'm sorry.
That's gotta be tough.
Yeah.
Being alone.
What do you say...
...we pack a picnic tomorrow morning and hike up to old Mount Arecibo?
I don't think I can. I gotta work.
All right, how about dinner, then, tomorrow night? I know a great dive.
I don't think so.
- Ellie, did I miss something?
- Huh?
No. Shit, I'm late.
I told Kent that I'd be there at 10:30.
You know, I'm not trying to push you.
No, no. I've wanted to look at this sector for weeks.
Just hang out and sleep in.
And there's a bunch of food in the fridge.
Okay?
How can I reach you?
Just leave your number. I'll call you.
YOUNG ELLIE:
Dad!
Dad, it's starting, you're gonna miss it.
Dad, there's another one. Hurry up.
TED:
In a minute, Sparks. I'm almost done.
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!
[CLATTERING]
Dad?
Daddy?
Dad.
I'll get the medicine.
Ellie.
I know it's hard to understand this now...
...but we aren't always meant to know why things happen the way they do.
Sometimes we just have to accept it as God's will.
I should have kept some medicine in the downstairs bathroom.
Then I could've gotten to it sooner.
[CHATTERING]
YOUNG ELLIE:
CQ...
...this is W-9 GFO. Do you copy?
Dad, this is Ellie. Come back.
This is Eleanor Arroway...
...transmitting on 14.2 megahertz.
Dad.
Are you there?
Come back.
Dad.
Are you there?
Dad, this is Ellie.
[BEEPING]
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
Ellie.
Hi, Kent. What are you doing up so early, huh?
I was thinking...
...we'd make a pretty good team.
What?
We could put together a kick-ass ad-hoc SETI program.
You know the Very Large Array in New Mexico?
It would be a dynamite place to do serious SETI...
What are you talking about, Kent?
Drumlin pulled the plug.
We're homeless.
Hey, watch it.
ELLIE:
Is it true, huh? Did you pull the plug?
You can't see it now, but I'm doing you a favor.
You are far too promising a scientist to be wasting your gifts on this nonsense.
Look, I don't consider what could be...
...the most important discovery of the human race nonsense, okay?
There's 400 billion stars...
And two probabilities.
One, there is intelligent life...
...but it's so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime.
- And two!
- You're making a decision...
There's nothing but noble gases and carbon compounds and you're wasting your time.
In the meantime, you won't be published, won't be taken seriously.
And your career will be over.
So what? It's my life.
Hey, Kent. You were right.
Screw Drumlin. We're gonna raise the money. We're going to New Mexico.
KENT: Chicago has all the stuff, but let me know how it goes.
I've got some more corporate stops on the East Coast for you.
Hey, Fish, did that investor from Houston ever get back to us?
FISHER:
I'm gonna hit him up on my way to L.A.
ELLIE: Try begging for some of that
Hollywood money.
Why not? They've been making money off of aliens for years, right?
- Begging is good for the soul.
- We'll see about that.
- Just do me a favor.
- Yeah.
Try not to be too confrontational.
Huh? Confrontational? Me?
What do you mean?
I'm gonna see if I left anything.
ELLIE: This is a unique time in our history, in the history of any civilization.
It's the moment of the acquisition of technology.
That's the moment where contact becomes possible.
The Very Large Array in New Mexico is the key to our chances for success.
With its 27 linked radio telescopes...
...we can search more accurately than at any other conventional facility.
Now, we've gotten approval to buy the telescope time from the government.
Now all we really need is the money.
A nice presentation, doctor.
But while our foundation arm has a mandate to support experimental programs...
...we must confess that your proposal seems less like science...
...and more like science fiction.
Science fiction.
You're right.
It's crazy.
In fact, it's even worse than that: Nuts.
You wanna hear something nutty?
A couple guys wanted to build something called an airplane.
You get people to go in it and fly like birds.
Ridiculous, right?
Or what about breaking the sound barrier...
...or rockets to the moon, or atomic energy or a mission to Mars?
Science fiction, right?
Look.
All I'm asking is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision.
You know, to just step back for one minute and look at the big picture.
To take a chance on something...
...which might end up being the most profoundly impactful moment...
...for humanity, for the history of history.
I'm sorry.
I just spent the last 13 months...
...coming into rooms like this and talking to people like you.
The truth is, you're my last chance, so...
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Doctor.
Yes, sir.
You have your money.
Thank you.
[MOTOR HUMMING]
MAN:
Oh! Perfect cast. Come on, fishy.
Frank, look at the size of that son of a bitch!
Welcome back, Dr. C.
How'd it go?
- How was the trip?
- I've had better.
Drumlin. What is this?
This his personal vendetta now?
It's not just Drumlin. There's been enormous pressure from other scientists as well.
It doesn't matter anyway,
Hadders funding us for another two years.
Uh... These are government-owned telescopes, they can lease to whomever.
And they don't want the high priestess of the desert using them anymore.
What?
Staring at static on TV for hours, listening to washing machines.
Did you really think these stories wouldn't get out?
- I was looking for patterns in the chaos.
- Doesrt matter, we're a joke to them.
They want us out.
We've got three months until the paperwork goes through.
Fine. I'll start looking for other funding.
I'll just start...
Could you face reality, please?
Just this once, Ellie. We lost.
It's over.
Fine.
But I'm not stopping.
If I have to go it alone, I'll go it alone.
I've done it before.
My guest tonight is author and theologian Palmer Joss.
He's become a spiritual counselor of sorts and a recent fixture at the White House.
"God's Diplomat," according to The New York Times.
His latest book, Losing Faith, is currently number one...
...on that publicatiors bestseller list.
Thanks for being with us, Palmer.
You have had quite a ride this last couple of years.
Yeah, I sure have, Larry.
You know, Fish, I was thinking.
Who would make the best astronomers?
I mean, think about it.
Who has the perfect synthesis of career and lifestyle?
- I give.
- Vampires!
Are you anti-technology?
Are you anti-science?
PALMER:
No, not at all.
The question that I'm asking is this:
Are we happier as a human race?
Is the world fundamentally a better place because of science and technology?
We shop at home, we surf the Web...
...but at the same time we feel emptier...
...and more cut off from each other than at any other time in human history.
I mean, we're becoming a synthesized society...
...in a great, big hurry to get to the next...
I think it's because we're looking for the meaning. What is the meaning?
We have mindless jobs, we take frantic vacations.
Deficit finance trips to the mall to buy more things...
...that we think are gonna fill these holes in our lives.
Is it any wonder that we've lost our sense of direction?
[BUZZING AND PULSING]
Holy shit.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Right ascension,
18 hours, 36 minutes, 56.2 seconds.
Declination, plus 36 degrees,
46 minutes...
...56.2 seconds!
Confirm!
Right ascension, 18 hours, 36 minutes,
56.2 seconds!
Hey, is anybody awake in there?
I'm moving the array!
- Confirm!
- Boss has a bogey!
Right ascension, 18 hours,
36 minutes, 56.2 seconds.
- Fish!
- We're on it.
Plus 36 hours,
47 minutes and 1 second.
Strong possible pulse chain on Sub-Array 4.
I'm moving the rest of them now.
I need you to confirm the coordinates.
Check the status of the array.
- She's doing all the dishes.
- All systems nominal.
Hello.
I need a full systems check.
Coordinates confirmed.
Willie's checking the system now.
Stay on top of the systems diagnostics.
Check the reference point offsets.
And I want you off-axis on 27 the second we get there.
And tell Willie to break out the big boy.
Copy that. Willie...
Yeah. Go, Ellie.
I can hear can it on the headphones.
We gotta be sure about this.
Give me another array status.
Her four are online, the rest are tracking in.
FISHER: Your four are online, the rest are tracking in.
But there's a bad drive on 16.
Your four are online, the rest are tracking in...
...but there's a bad drive on 16.
Copy that?
What do you want me to do about the source queue?
Look, forget about it and hold the queue.
Go get ready to set the target frequency to manual the second we're aligned.
Do you copy? I want you to go off-axis on 27 the second we're there.
And leave the LO frequency where it is.
Stay on it, Fish, don't let it get away.
If you lose it, scan the band.
Run every frequency you can think of.
How you doing?
Talk to me, guys.
Partially polarized set of moving pulses, amplitude modulated.
We're locked. Systems check out, signal across the board. What's the frequency?
4.46, 23 gigahertz.
Hydrogen times pi. Told you.
Strong sucker too.
I got it! I got it, I got it!
I'm patched in.
ELLIE:
All right, let me hear it.
[PULSING]
Listen to that.
Make me a liar, Fish.
It could be AWACS out of Kirtland jamming us.
But I'm doubting it.
All right, let's see if F.U.D.D.'s reading it too.
Willie, patch it back and give me the off-axis.
- Are we recording?
- Never stopped.
Thank you, Elmer.
AWACS status is negative.
- White Sands?
- On this frequency? No.
I'm gonna punch up the darks.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Come on.
FISHER: NORAD's not tracking any snoops in this vector.
Shuttle Endeavor is in sleep mode.
Okay, point source confirmed.
- Whatever it is, it ain't local.
- Position?
WILLIE: I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra, I think.
- Vega?
FISHER: Can't be.
It's only 26 light years away.
- What's the peak intensity?
FISHER: Coming up.
ELLIE:
Vega.
Vega. I scanned it a bunch of times at
Arecibo. It was negative results, always.
Got it. Reading over 100 janskys.
Jesus. I could pick it up on my...
[PULSING STOPS]
No.
[PULSING]
Come on.
All right, it's restarting.
Wait a minute. Those are numbers.
That was a three, the one before it was a two.
Base-10 numbers. Just start counting now, see how far can we get.
One.
WILLIE: Seven.
ELLIE: Seven.
Those are primes.
Two, three, five, seven, those are all prime numbers.
There's no way that's a natural phenomenon.
- Holy shit.
- Okay, okay.
Let's just calm down and pull up the star file on Vega.
FISHER: It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young...
...so it can't have a planetary system...
...let alone life or a technological civilization.
Maybe they didn't grow up there.
Maybe they're visiting.
Spacecraft? This system is full of debris. It would get clobbered.
Well, not if they used their laser blasters and photon torpedoes.
- That's not funny.
- How else are we gonna explain it?
Willie's right. If we go public with this and we're wrong, that's it.
It's over. We're cooked.
God, I wish Kent was here.
Whatever the signal is, we better do something soon. Vega's gonna set.
Position confirmed.
We've got 4.4623 gigahertz, confirmed.
We've got 112 janskys.
All right, do you have a source location yet?
We put it right smack in the middle.
Vega.
Okay, thanks, lan. Keep tracking and we'll get back to you.
Yeah, right-o.
FISHER:
Okay, 101.
The pulse sequenced through every prime number between two and 101.
Who are we gonna call now?
Everybody.
MAN 1 [ON TV]: The rumors are flying, the implications extraordinary.
This morning's detection of an unidentified radio source from deep space...
...can neither be confirmed nor denied.
But the military presence arriving...
MAN 2: Sources close to the VLA report that the planet has been contacted...
...by some form of intelligent being...
...living outside of our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation...
...that the official IAU communiqué was sent from this government facility.
KITZ:
I want all of these people out of here.
Where's the girl?
Twenty-two stations worldwide now confirming the signal.
Vega is currently below our horizon...
...so what you're hearing is the signal from-
Get decryption people in here now.
Lunacharsky is visiting at Cal Tech.
Explain this to me.
If the source of the signal is so sophisticated, why the remedial math?
Exactly, why don't they speak English?
Maybe because 70 percent of the planet speaks other languages.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language.
It's no coincidence that they're using primes.
- I don't get it.
- Prime numbers.
That would be integers that are only divisible by themselves and one.
We think this may be a beacon, some kind of an announcement...
...to get our attention.
If it's attention you want, you got that.
One thing: Vega.
People have been looking at Vega for years with no results.
And now yesterday they start broadcasting primes. Why?
Well, it's hardly yesterday, because the signal has been transmitting for 26 years.
Dr. Arroway.
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Let me first say that your...
Actually, first, could you ask the gentlemen with the firearms to wait outside?
This is supposed to be a civilian facility.
- Doctor, with all due respect to your...
- Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hi, I'm so glad you're back.
Come on, I got something for you to hear.
Is this great?
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.
Sit down. And we could use some help with the spectrum analysis.
- Listen to that. I'll get on it.
- Headsets.
So I'll just come right to the point, shall I?
Your having sent this all over the world may constitute a breach of national security.
This isn't a person-to-person call.
You can't think that a civilization sending this would intend it just for Americans.
I'm saying you might have consulted us.
- The contents could be extremely sensitive.
- You want to classify prime numbers?
Mike, please. We're only in line with Vega so many hours a day.
The only way to monitor the signal is to get the cooperation of other stations.
If Dr. Arroway hadrt acted quickly, we could have lost key elements.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes.
If you're right about there being a more significant transmission...
Which will need help to receive and decode.
Doctor, do you understand that my job is to protect...?
KENT: Shh!
- What?
- Listen.
- I hear it.
- Hear what?
- Harmonic.
Bingo. I had Willie ask Rattan to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.
There's a lot more here, folks.
- Fish, let's get on the negative sideband.
FISHER: I'm already on it.
KITZ: What is going on?
DRUMLIN: Another signal.
Another signal, look at that.
A second signal at double the frequency.
It looks like a...
Somebody get a TV monitor.
Patch the recording into the image processor.
- You want the new data?
- Yeah, the new frequency we just recorded.
David, explain this to me, please.
With the prime there's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.
WILLIE:
We're hot.
Do me a favor, go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.
You're patched in.
All right, it's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.
What do you make of that, Fish?
It's two different interlaced frames.
I'm framing one.
ELLIE: It's just noise.
FISHER: Trying frame two.
I've got an offset carrier here.
I think it's audio.
Plug it in, plug it in.
Center that segment.
FISHER:
Centering.
- Can you clean it up any more than that?
FISHER: I'm working on it.
What the hell...?
Try zooming out.
All right, freeze.
Reverse values.
Try zooming out again.
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock...
DRUMLIN:
My God.
[HITLER SPEAKING IN GERMAN
ON RADIO]
- Okay.
KENT: What's going on?
You're not gonna believe this.
Does anybody speak German?
"I declare the Games in Berlin...
...at the celebration...
...of the first Olympics of the new era has opened."
Get me the White House.
Twenty million people died defeating that son of a bitch...
...and he's our first ambassador to outer space?
- Actually...
- The broadcast from the '36 Olympics...
...was the first television transmission that went into space.
That they recorded it and sent it back is saying, "Hello, we heard you."
Or, "Sjeg Heil, you're our kind of people."
Wait. Hitler and his politics have nothing to do with this.
It's highly unlikely they would understand, and people need to understand...
The people are in very good hands,
Dr. Arroway.
We'll take it from here.
WOMAN [ON TV]:
The White House has just released...
Smile, folks. We're on.
- A statement confirming a message from deep space...
...has been received by American scientists.
Claire Shipman is at the White House.
Donna, we've been told the president will have only a few remarks...
...about today's announcement...
...and that he won't be taking any questions from the press.
Good afternoon.
I'm glad to be joined by my science and technology advisor.
This is the product of years of exploration...
...by some of the world's most distinguished scientists.
Like all discoveries, this one will and should continue to be reviewed...
...examined and scrutinized.
It must be confirmed by other scientists.
The fact that something of this magnitude is being explored is another...
Fish, what is the story over here?
I thought Ellie was supposed to be on.
I don't know.
Guys? Guys? Um...
You know those interlaced frames that we thought were noise?
This has structure. I'm hearing structure.
If this discovery is confirmed...
...it will be one of the most stunning insights into our universe...
...that science has ever uncovered.
Its implications are as far-reaching and awe-inspiring as can be imagined.
Even as it promises answers to some of our oldest questions...
...it poses still others, even more fundamental.
We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say...
...as we continue the search for answers and for knowledge...
...that is as old as humanity itself but essential to our people's future.
- Thank you.
MAN: Sir...
Is there a considerable global security threat?
I'll answer your questions at the end, but first a few corrections.
The message was received Friday morning,
6:31 a.m. Mountain Standard Time.
It was largely mathematical, and in spite of reports you may have seen to the contrary...
...appears to be completely benign in nature.
Let me say that again.
The message is completely benign.
The president has been in touch with heads of state from around the world...
...and every possible security measure is being taken.
To better explain to you the events of the last 48 hours...
...l'm turning you over to the leader of the team that made this remarkable discovery...
...Dr. David Drumlin, special science advisor to the president.
Thank you, Rachel. Hello.
In 1936 a very faint television signal...
...transmitted the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games...
...as a show of German superior technology.
That signal left Earth at the speed of light...
[PHONE RINGING]
...and 26 years later arrived in the vicinity of the star we call Vega.
That signal has been sent back to us hugely amplified...
...an unmistakable sign of intelligence.
ELLIE:
You're online, Kent, go ahead.
KENT: The Adolf transmission used 25 frames per second but we're receiving 50.
So we canned the other 25 through a series of search algorithms.
We found a series of markers on the top of each frame.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Send it, Willie.
WILLIE: Okay, here it comes.
KENT:
It's digital...
...massive amounts of data which extend right to the higher harmonics.
Jackpot.
ELLIE:
All right, as you'll see...
...interlaced with the frames of the original Hitler image...
...we found these sections.
Now, we thought they were just noise, but they're actually data...
...huge amounts of it.
When we combine this with the data from the amplification of the original signal...
...we get these encrypted pages of text.
Now, no two are alike and we've uncovered over 10,000 already.
What does it mean, doctor?
Well, we have no idea.
It could be anything.
It could be the first volume of an Encyclopedia Galactica.
Instructions to acquaint us with their colonization procedures.
Moses with a few billion new commandments.
How long will it take to decode it?
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...
We need to get the best decryption people we have.
I intend to use the VLA as my command post.
In the meantime, my office has made out a preliminary budget.
Wait a minute.
This is a privately-funded operation.
We're only leasing dish time from the government...
If there's a more clear case of eminent domain, I've never seen it.
I'm going to recommend we militarize this project.
What? This is my project.
Nobody knows more about these scenarios than I do. David, tell them...
Excuse me, could we calm down here?
Now, I'm going to recommend that
Dr. Drumlin coordinate the decryption effort.
However, in light of Dr. Arroway's long experience in these matters...
...for the time being, she will continue to direct operations at the VLA...
...understanding that future discoveries will be kept in strictest confidence...
...until such time as the president...
...can decide the most suitable course of action. Understood?
Yes.
MAN:
This is CNN Breaking News.
The president made a statement, calling the message from Vega...
...one of the most stunning insights into our...
Attendance at religious services has risen a dramatic 39 percent in recent days.
...as police in three German divisions clashed with neo-Nazi protesters.
So it turns out there's life on other planets.
Boy, this is really gonna change the Miss Universe contest.
Health officials from around the world are concerned that the message from Vega...
...might trigger a rash of mass suicides...
...not unlike the recent cult deaths near San Diego...
Even a scientist has to admit...
...that there are some pretty serious religious overtones to all this.
Let's hear from someone whose organization...
...has been accused of conducting its own inquisition:
Richard Rank, head of the Conservative coalition.
Thank you.
This is yet another example of science intruding into matters of faith.
This means they have been reacting to TV signals...
...they got from the 1930s.
They're just getting them.
Imagine how disappointed they're gonna be if they're Cubs fans.
We now take you to Jeremy Roth, who is reporting on events...
...at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico.
Like a bolt from the blue it came.
The message from Vega has caused thousands of believers and non-believers...
...to descend upon the VLA facility here in the desert of New Mexico.
Many have come to protest, many to pray...
...but most have come to participate in what has become the best show in town.
[CHATTERING]
[CHANTING]
That's right. I'll be there in Vega, thank you very much.
CHORUS [SINGING]: Hajl to Vega
Hail to Vega, Hail to Vega
Hail to Vega
But they have failed!
It's the same people who, again and again...
...have brought us to the brink of destruction.
Who've polluted our air, who've poisoned our water.
Now these scientists...
...have had their chance.
Are these the kind of people...
...that you want talking to your God for you?
[PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN [ON TV]:
Efforts continue around the clock.
But for now, almost 2 full weeks after the message's arrival...
...scientists here at the VLA still have no answers...
...only more questions.
Jeremy Roth, CNN,
Soccorro, New Mexico.
More on the quest for the message's meaning, after this.
They gotta line up somehow.
Yeah, well, this one doesn't fit, either.
We've tried over a million permutations.
Always, I can only get three corners to fit.
I don't understand their significance.
What...? Somebody broke in...
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
Hey, listen, I don't know who you are, but you broke into the database...
What? Now?
Where?
[FAX MACHINE HUMMING]
I'll be there.
MAN 1:
You should feel fortunate.
He hardly lands for anyone.
MAN 2:
Dr. Arroway...
...I presume?
Mr. Hadden.
I've had my eye on you a long time, doctor.
I consider you one of my most valuable long-term investments.
And when it comes to my investments...
...I always do my homework.
Eleanor Ann Arroway...
...born 25th August, 1964...
...De Pere, Wisconsin.
Mother, Joanna, died from complications during childbirth.
Early testing indicated high predisposition...
...towards science and mathematics.
Father, Theodore...
...advised to provide enrichment activities along these lines...
...did so conscientiously until his death...
...from myocardial infarction,
November 10, 1974.
You graduated from high school in 1979...
...almost two full years early.
Awarded full scholarship, M.I. T, graduated magna cum laude.
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...
...where you did breakthrough work on the lanthanide-doped ruby maser...
...dramatically increasing the sensitivity of radio telescopes.
Subsequently offered a teaching position at Harvard University...
...which you turned down to pursue SETI work...
...at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
Changes in NSF policy gave rise to certain funding problems...
...at which point you came to my attention.
You compromised our security codes.
Once upon a time...
...I was a hell of an engineer.
Please, sit, doctor.
I have guests so rarely, it's important to me that they feel welcome in my home.
You live here?
I find it convenient to keep my interests...
...mobile.
Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground.
Well, I... I guess I should...
Well, I guess I should thank you for having bailed me out all that time.
I know a good bet when I see one.
Earl Grey. No sugar, no milk, I believe.
What am I doing here?
[CHUCKLES]
The powers that be have been very busy lately...
...falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the millennium.
Maybe I can help deal you back in.
I didn't realize that I was out.
No, maybe not out...
...but certainly being handed your hat.
I've had a long time to make enemies, doctor.
And there are many governments, business interests...
...even religious leaders that would like to see me depart this earth.
And I'll grant them their wish soon enough.
But before I do,
I wish to make a small contribution.
A final gesture of goodwill to the people of this little planet that have given...
From whom I have taken so much.
You found the primer.
Clever girl.
Lights.
Pages and pages of data.
Over 63,000 in all.
And on the perimeter of each...
Alignment symbols, a registration mark, but they don't line up.
They do, if you think like a Vegan.
An alien intelligence has got be more advanced...
...and that means efficiency functioning on multiple levels...
...and in multiple dimensions.
Yes, of course!
Where's the primer?
You'll see.
Every three-dimensional page contains a piece of the primer.
There it was all the time, staring you in the face.
Buried within the message itself is the key to decoding it.
Within the layering of the matrix, we have these basic equations:
So with this very elementary foundation, they have given us a kind of...
...general scientific vocabulary.
We now have the symbols for true and false...
This was the key...
...that allowed us to decipher their language...
...for physics, geometry, chemistry.
Next frame, Ellie.
Yes, and when we apply this to the rest of the message...
...we find this.
Those look like engineering schematics, almost like blueprints.
Yeah.
Yes.
It is our belief that the message contains instructions...
...for building something, some kind of machine.
A machine? That does what, doctor?
We don't know.
It might be some type...
...of advanced communication device, or a teaching machine of some kind.
Or it might turn out to be some kind of a transport.
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.
The fact is, you don't know what it does.
It could be anything.
Could be a Trojan horse. We build it and out pours the entire Vegan army.
Why bother risking the personnel?
It could be a weapon.
Right. Some kind of a doomsday machine.
Exactly. Every time they detect a new civilization...
...they fax these construction documents from space.
We poor saps build whatever this is and blow ourselves to kingdom come.
There's no reason to believe that their intentions are hostile.
Why is the default position of the egghead set that aliens would always be benign?
- Why is that, doctor?
- We pose no threat to them.
It would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on an anthill in Africa
DRUMLIN:
That's an interesting analogy.
And how guilty would we feel if we destroyed a few microbes on an anthill?
I hope you're right, doctor. I really do.
But right now my job is to protect
American lives from any threat.
In that regard, I am obligated to assume the worst.
Well, yes, and I am forced to agree with you.
My problem is this:
The content of that message is morally ambiguous at best.
Now, our internal numbers show support for this is incredibly soft.
If the president wishes to stay this course...
...you're gonna find his numbers going south like a duck.
- This is nuts.
RANK: Excuse me...
...miss.
We know nothing of these creatures' values.
The fact is, we don't even know whether they believe in God.
- This doesn't make any sense. If you...
CONSTANTINE: Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.
We won't be suppressing any opinions here today.
No, of course not. I understand.
What I meant to say...
...is the message was written in the language of science.
Now, if it had been religious in nature, it should have taken the form...
...of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky.
But a voice from the sky...
...is exactly what you found,
Doctor Arroway.
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.
Now, I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable...
...religious implications at stake here.
But that doesn't justify taking an alarmist position.
My hope here is that we can find a common ground...
...break through any obstacles that may have kept us apart.
KITZ: Well, perhaps...
- Listen, I need to make one thing very clear.
Our organization will not be placated with flowery New Age rhetoric...
Mr. President.
The President met with his top advisors today...
...regarding the latest efforts to decode the message.
While there has been some progress, the official line remains a cautious one.
If you're asking when we'll find out what the purpose of that machine is...
...maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, maybe never.
There he is. The man with his finger on the spiritual pulse of the nation.
- It's so good to see you, Ellie.
- You too.
Your discovery, all of this.
It must be a real vindication.
I'm really happy for you.
- Are you?
- Mr. Joss, the president is waiting.
- Okay. Yeah.
- The president is waiting.
- Ellie, see you at the reception tonight?
- Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.
All right, great.
Excuse me, Miss Constantine, may I speak to you?
Certainly.
- I have a big problem.
- Yes?
Um...
Do you know where I can find, like, a really great dress?
[PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
God created man in the form of himself, not in the form of monkeys!

Get a job.
Don't waste my tax dollars.
You hear me?
Wow.
You look beautiful, Ellie.
- So do you.
- You really do.
I read your book.
Here we go.
Would you like me to quote you?
"Ironically, the thing that people are most hungry for, meaning...
...is the one thing that science hasn't been able to give them."
Yeah. Yeah.
Come on. It's like you're saying that science killed God.
What if science simply revealed...
...that he never existed in the first place?
- I think we're gonna need to get some air.
- What?
And a few more of these.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- A little chilly out here.
- Yeah, this is nice.
- I got one for you.
- What?
Occam's razor. Ever heard of it?
Hoccam's razor.
Sounds like some slasher movie.
No, Occam's Razor.
It's a basic scientific principle. It says...
...all things being equal, the simplest explanation tends to be the right one.
- Makes sense to me.
- All right.
- So, what's more likely? Thank you.
- You're welcome.
An all-powerful, mysterious God created the universe...
...and then decided not to give any proof of his existence?
Or that he simply doesn't exist at all and that we created him...
...so we wouldn't have to feel so small and alone.
I don't know.
I couldn't imagine living in a world where God didn't exist.
I wouldn't want to.
How do you know that you're not deluding yourself?
I mean, for me, I'd need proof.
Proof?
- Did you love your father?
- What?
Your dad, did you love him?
Yes. Very much.
Prove it.

[PAGER BEEPING]
- The White House.
- Mr. Joss.
DRUMLIN: I don't want excuses.
Whoever is responsible, I want their head.
- Ellie?
- What happened?
You were right all along.
The decryption team at the VLA has been working around the clock...
...and the hard work has finally paid off.
This key section, uncovered tonight and obtained exclusively by CNN...
...shows an illustration of what is of a human figure...
...inside a geometric structure of some kind.
This and other contextual clues...
...now lead scientists to believe that the message is, in fact...
- President called an emergency meeting.
- Yeah, I imagine he would.
- Designed to take a single human occupant into space...
...presumably to the star Vega.
MAN: I'm gonna miss my mother's birthday party.
KITZ: Call her in the morning, tell her why you didn't show up.
Tell me.
They're gonna build it.
Who gets to go?
The president's just gone international to spread the risk and cost...
Who gets to go, though?
Well, it's complicated, Ellie.
What?
They have formed a group of international candidates.
Now, it's your discovery.
Okay, they understand that.
You're at the top of a very short list.
But they're also putting together a selection committee.
It's made of scholars, theologians, scientists, philosophers...
You're on it.
I've been asked, yes.
I guess that means...
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...
Yeah.
What you don't understand, Ellie, is...
- I understand.
- Ellie...
I want you to know, whatever happens, as far as I'm concerned...
Well...
...good luck.
Well, whatever you do, make sure he doesn't monopolize the committee.
He is not on the committee, Ellie.
What?
He just resigned as science advisor.
He wants to be the one to go.
MAN [ON TV]: The president is already beginning to feel the financial pinch.
Sources say the cost of the project...
...is spiraling to more than a third of a trillion dollars...
...making this what may be the most expensive single project...
...in all of human history.
Meanwhile, months of debate finally reached a conclusion last week...
...as 10 candidates were selected by the IMC...
...representing a cross section of political, philosophical and religious views.
Many of these are the same experts who have been consulting...
...on the Machine's design and function.
They will be actively participating on-site during the construction process.
But the choice of these 10 candidates has not been without controversy.
Fully one-third of the candidates are American.
Many international observers are asking why.
The U.S. Is shouldering an enormous percentage of the financial...
Isn't it true that the contractors, like Hadden Industries...
...are making those contributions in exchange for technology rights?
Different nations are being compensated in different ways. For example...
Japan made headlines when it announced it would forego candidate representation...
...in exchange for the systems integration subcontract.
On what basis do you choose a human being to represent humanity?
Good question, Larry.
Yes, well, if nothing else...
...it should be somebody who is fluent in the language the message was given in.
Science, in this case.
Doctor Arroway, despite your obvious enthusiasm...
...there's been a lot of criticism of late...
...that this whole endeavor is simply too dangerous.
Some of that criticism from scientists.
One Nobel Prize winner recently noted, his words:
"There is every indication...
...that this is simply beyond our capabilities, that this endeavor will fail...
...and that the Machine's occupant will pay for that failure with their life."
How do you respond to that?
ELLIE: Well, this message is from a civilization that may be anywhere...
...from hundreds to millions and millions of years ahead of us.
I have to believe that an intelligence that advanced...
...knows what they're doing.
Now all it requires on our part is...
Faith?
I was gonna say a sense of adventure.
MAN:
And in breaking news...
...a former astronaut...
...considered to be the leading American candidate for the Machine seat...
...has unexpectedly dropped out of the running.
Russell met with reporters this afternoon at his Houston home.
I told my dad that I didn't want him to go.
Daddy, don't go.
Nothing would give me more pride than to...
...represent my country.
But what can I say to this?
Consortium officials had no comment, but sources within the delegation...
...have disclosed that Dr. Arroway...
...appears to now be the front-runner for the Machine seat.
ELLIE:
"Meet me at noon. Must talk."
I didn't expect to be getting a message like this from you.
Thanks for coming.
So is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?
Selectors and selectees mingling around?
Can we talk about Einstein?
Yeah, sure. Okay.
- Special relativity.
- Yeah.
This machine...
...now, if it works, and you travel to Vega at even close to the speed of light...
...when you come back...
- If you come back.
If you come back...
...you'll only be 4 years older, but over
50 years would have passed here on Earth.
Basically, yeah.
And everybody that you care about...
...will be gone, dead and buried.
If you came back, if you survived at all, which...
Look, Palmer, nobody's saying this isn't dangerous, all right?
The rest of the candidates and myself, we fully understand the risks we're taking.
Why?
Because it's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...
No, you, Ellie. You. You personally.
By doing this, you're willing to give your life.
You're willing to die for it.
Why?
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...
...something...
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?
If this is a chance to find out even just a little part of that answer...
I don't know,
I think it's won'th a human life.
Don't you?
You're an incredibly brave woman, Ellie.
Or incredibly nuts.
Palmer...
I'm really confused.
So am I.
I think I speak for us all when I thank you for your patience.
Myself, I have one final question,
Dr. Arroway.
If you should meet these Vegans...
...and were permitted only one question to ask of them...
...what would it be?
Well, I suppose it would be:
"How did you do it?
How did you evolve? How did you survive this technological adolescence...
...without destroying yourself?"
That more than any other question is one
I personally would like to have answered.
Not too bad, Mike.
PATEL:
I join Dr. Bergeron...
...in expressing thanks for your patience, Dr. Arroway.
We've all been most impressed with your candor...
...and your stamina.
I believe we are ready to move on to your final statement.
Madam Chairman,
I have one more question.
Yes, Mr. Joss.
Dr. Arroway...
Would you consider yourself...
...a spiritual person?
Uh...
I don't really understand the point of the question.
I consider myself a moral person.
PATEL:
I'm sure we all agree that is the case...
...but I think what Mr. Joss is in fact asking...
Do you believe in God...
...Dr. Arroway?
As a scientist...
...I rely on empirical evidence, and in this matter...
...I don't believe that there is data either way.
PATEL: So your answer would in fact be that you don't believe in God.
I don't understand the relevance of the question.
Dr. Arroway,
95 percent of the world's population...
...believes in a supreme being in one form or another.
I believe that makes the question more than relevant.
PATEL:
Dr. Arroway?
I believe, um...
I believe I've already answered that question.
I'm proud of what we've achieved as a species...
...and as a civilization.
I would hate to see everything we stand for...
...all that we have fought for for a thousand generations...
...all that God has blessed us with...
...betrayed...
...in the final hour because we chose to send a representative who did not put our...
...most cherished beliefs first.
Thank you.
[KNOCKING]
Why did you do it?
Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody.
I just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person...
...who doesn't believe in God.
Someone who...
...honestly thinks the other 95 percent of us...
...suffer from some form of mass delusion.
I told the truth up there.
And Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear.
DRUMLIN:
With full humility and utmost gratitude...
...I accept this great honor...
...and I promise I will do my best to represent my nation...
...my planet and my God on this historic journey.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[APPLAUDING]
MAN [ON TV]: There's a carnival atmosphere at Cape Canaveral...
...as the International
Machine Consortium...
...hosts as much a media event as a systems test.
David Drumlin is supervising the on-site portion of the test.
We spoke with him earlier today.
DRUMLIN: We'll be able to monjtor the stresses and effects...
...using the robot passenger...
...who we lovingly call Elmer.
WOMAN [OVER SPEAKER]: We are coming up on T-minus two hours and counting.
All Machine systems are go.
Dr. Arroway, the press would like to ask you a few questions...
...as soon as they're done with Dr. Drumlin.
DRUMLIN: Now, at the moment where we release the pod...
...there will be a substantial amount of energy generated at the core.
We'll be able to monitor the stresses and effects...
...using our robot passenger, who we lovingly call Elmer.
[CHUCKLES]
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
WOMAN:
- The test area is clear and go.
Sir, they're ready for you out at the site.
Yeah, just a minute.
WOMAN: The test director has issued a go to enter the final countdown phase.
Ellie.
- Congratulations, David.
- Glad you could come.
Didrt, uh, expect to see you here.
Well, I'm still, you know,
Crew Ops at the Control Center.
And I suppose the fact that I discovered the message means that I have PR value.
Of course.
Ellie, I know you must think this is all very unfair.
And maybe that's an understatement.
What you don't know is, I agree.
I wish the world was a place where fair was the bottom line.
Where the kind of idealism you showed at the hearing was rewarded...
...not taken advantage of.
Unfortunately, we don't live in that world.
Funny...
...I always believed that the world is what we make of it.
Excuse me, Dr. Drumlin, sir?
Good luck on the test.
- The pad leader has issued the order...
- Thank you.
...to clear the pad of all nonessential...
- Right this way, sir.
Test director, everything looks good up here. We're ready to go.
STEVE: All right, people, I want things double and triple checked here.
We only get one shot at this.
Let's get it right.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready for startup.
All controllers, I need a go-no-go for test initiation.
- Mechanical?
MAN 1: Go.
- Electrical?
MAN 2: Go.
- Dynamics?
MAN 3: Go.
- Communications?
MAN 4: Go.
- Pod systems?
WOMAN: Go
- Safety?
MAN 5: Go.
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test procedures are complete.
Yes, verified. I'm go.
Pad leader, we are good.
Is everything okay with you?
Roger. The pad is a go.
STEVE:
Test initiation, on my mark.
Five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
Mark.
MAN 1: Test start.
MAN 2: Rings are unlocked.
MAN 3:
Power levels indicate a good start.
WOMAN 1: We have begun the full-scale test of Earth's first system...
...built by the sharing of knowledge with a neighbor in our universe.
MAN 4:
All power sources on core induction bus.
WOMAN 2:
IPV power transfer.
GERRY: Ring motion detect.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.
STEVE: Gerry, how are we looking?
GERRY: Looks good. We're underway.
DRUMLIN:
Looks like we have a normal startup.
STEVE:
Roger, David. It's looking good here.
[CHEERING]
WOMAN 1: We are moments away from the initiation of the drop sequence.
All systems are go.
STEVE: Mechanical, you still happy?
MAN 1: Roger that.
DRUMLIN: I'll tell you, this is very exciting from up here.
GERRY: We've got 4 percent.
DRUMLIN: We're confirming 4 percent.
Frequency 9.85.
Harmonics in the green. G-level 1.1.
- Five percent.
- Confirmed. We are at 5 percent.
David, how's it looking to you?
DRUMLIN: Okay. I'm gonna take a look and show you what we got.
MAN 2: All test-subject instrumentation looks good.
Confirmed, we have a good picture from Dr. Drumlirs PRD.
DRUMLIN: Hope you guys are seeing what I'm seeing.
MAN 3:
All systems are go.
DRUMLIN:
This is really something.
MAN 4:
For purposes of this test...
...Dr. Drumlin will be on top of the gantry crane that's over the Machine.
We've got some video animation...
...to show you just how this machine, it is thought, will work.
The passenger pod will be released.
It will come down through the center of the rings and into the Machine's core.
The big question everyone here is asking is, of course, what happens then?
Some believe that the rings function as some sort of an accelerator or something...
...sending its energy into this passenger pod...
...making it rocket away at near the speed of light.
Other people believe it might open up a doorway to some other dimension.
Who's right?
Well, that's what today's test is all about.
GERRY: Thirty-five percent.
MAN 1: Subsystems, are you ready?
GERRY: Forty percent normal acceleration.
MAN 2: Roger, confirm 40 percent.
STEVE: All controllers stand by to initiate drop sequence...
...on my mark.
MAN 3:
All systems ready for drop sequence.
GERRY:
Forty-five percent.
DRUMLIN:
We're reading 45 percent.
Can you verify closure?
GERRY:
Forty-six.
STEVE: All controllers stand by to initiate IPV drop sequence. On my mark.
GERRY:
Forty-eight percent.
DRUMLIN: Test djrector,
I'm feeling a very strange vibration.
Are you feeling it down there?
STEVE:
Gerry, can you confirm any vibration?
GERRY:
Negative, everything looks good here.
- Crew Ops?
- Nothing wrong with Elmer.
We're not seeing anything abnormal.
DRUMLIN: No good. Hold the sequence.
I'm gonna take a direct reading.
STEVE: What the hell is he talking about?
- Can anyone say grandstanding?
He sure knows he's on TV!
Back home that's what we call an overcooked ham.
DRUMLIN:
I'm reading 10 kilohertz!
What's your reading on the first and second order G-levels?
MAN 1:
G-levels are right on.
MAN 2: We confirm Drumlirs readings and they're all normal. We're go.
STEVE:
Copy that, Dynamics.
I think we're okay, but we'll let him finish.
- Mechanical, you still okay?
MAN 3: Roger, chief.
We're right on the money.
We've got a security problem here.
Ellie, are you sure?
Yeah. This guy, he shouldn't be there.
I know him.
Gerry, execute the rapid shutdown sequence.
Security, move emergency response team into position one.
- Get me Drumlin on a secure loop, please.
- You got him.
- David, can you hear me?
DRUMLIN: Yes, I hear.
ELLIE: All right, we've got a security breach here.
Right behind you. The tall guy.
The technician. See him?
He's not supposed to be there.
David, he's got something in his hand!
Him! Take him! Security breach!
He's got a bomb!
STEVE: I want that emergency-response team up on the gantry now.
Security, stage one alert.
By God, move all the fire and rescue personnel into position one.
[YELLING]
[SCREAMING]
STEVE:
All right, all right, back to your stations.
I need you to be professional, people.
Settle down.
Pad leader, pad leader, do you copy?
The scene earlier today, when David Drumlin...
...advisor to two presidents...
...and winner of the National Academy of Sciences lifetime award...
...was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.
In a related story, last night's raid...
Can I help you?
- Oh, you're... I've got some mail for you.
...resulted in the discovery of this video.
The suicide note of the leader of the terrorist group now believed responsible...
...for the explosion in Florida this week.
What we do, we do for the goodness of all mankind.
This won't be understood, not now...
...but the apocalypse to come...
...will vindicate our faith.
[PULSING]
Welcome home.
[MAN SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN
ON TV]
Oh, Comrade Arroway...
...he has been expecting your call.
One moment, please.
Mr. Hadden?
Doctor.
How kind of you to call.
Mr. Hadden, where are you?
The Russian government was kind enough to give me accommodations on Mir.
You're living on a space station?
It's quite simple, really.
The low-oxygen, zero-gravity environment...
...is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.
Actually, I quite like it up here.
My little room has one hell of a view.
I wanna show you something.
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
Look closer.
First rule in government spending:
Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?
Only, this one can be kept secret.
Controlled by Americans...
...built by the Japanese subcontractors...
...who also happen to be...
...recently acquired...
...wholly-owned subsidiaries...
...of Hadden Industries.
- Of Hadden Industries.
They still want an American to go, doctor.
Wanna take a ride?
WOMAN: And augmenting our restraint and communications console subsystem...
...we have your personal recording unit.
Normal, infrared and ultraviolet lenses.
Digital microchip good for thousands of hours of recording.
Okay, look, I understand...
...the reason for recording and documenting the mission.
But I just... I wanna go on record one more time.
The transmitted specs never said anything about any chair...
...or a restraining harness or survival gear.
Why can't we just trust the original...?
Doctor, both the IMC Board and the SI team reviewed the matter...
...and concluded that the design impact is negligible.
Bottom line is...
...we're not putting anybody aboard this machine...
...unless there is some sort of minimal protection.
End of story.
- Okay.
MAN: Ellie...
...we've been giving these to the astronauts since the beginning of the space program.
It's never been made public, of course.
It's fast and it's painless.
I'm gonna travel 26 light years to commit suicide?
Something may go wrong.
There may be an unforeseen mechanical failure.
You could be marooned, unable to return.
There are a thousand reasons we can think of for you to have this...
...but mostly it's for the reasons we can't think of.
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
- Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.
- Thank you.
I know you don't have much time.
As soon as I found out about the Machine,
I called the president.
I came with Kitz.
I had to see you one more time.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
No, I'm glad you came.
There's something I gotta say to you.
The reason I didn't vote for you to go was a good reason, but it wasrt the real one.
I didn't vote for you to go...
...because I don't wanna lose you.
You find your way home, all right?
Twenty-three hours ago...
...the world was stunned by the announcement of a second Machine...
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.
Now the question that's on everyone's mind:
Will history repeat itself?
With a piece of engineering this complex...
...with so many unknowns, could the unthinkable occur?
The security in Hokkaido has been incredibly tight.
No reporters whatsoever have been allowed near the site.
Thanks.
Magnetic restraint is secure.
All life support functions normal.
Roger that. Ellie, this is Control.
Do you copy?
Ellie to Control, reading you five-by-five.
- Comm 1, Give me Ellie's PRD.
- Video unit recording and transmitting.
- Are you reading me?
STEVE: That's affirmative.
Video looks good.
- Copy that, Control.
- Okay.
Ellie, we're gonna proceed to button you up.
Roger, Control. I'm ready.
- Dynamics...
- I can confirm the walkway retraction.
STEVE: Systems?
MAN 1: Go.
STEVE: Communications?
MAN 2: Go.
STEVE: Life support?
WOMAN: Go.
Ellie, we are go for closure.
I'm go here.
STEVE: Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.
Hold on, let me get you a chair.
ELLIE:
I'm go.
- It's nice to smell you again, Mr. Kitz.
- You too.
Wouldrt peg him as a Polo man.
I got a visual on the door.
WOMAN:
IPV escape system is armed.
Door is looking good.
Door alignment looks good.
Ellie, we are showing green across the board.
Copy that, Control. IPV is secure.
GERRY:
We are at 30 percent.
Copy that, 30 percent.
- How you doing in there, EI?
- Kent?
- Is that you?
- That's a big affirmative.
Who let you in there, huh?
A higher power intervened.
Well, I'm glad you came.
GERRY:
Thirty-five percent.
Copy that, 35 percent.
- Mechanical?
- We're good.
Forty percent.
I'm picking up a moderate vibration here.
- Dynamics, can you confirm vibration?
GERRY: Everything looks good here.
She's feeling the same thing they felt at the Cape at this point.
Ellie, the vibration is normal.
GERRY: We are at 50 percent.
All systems nominal.
Copy that, 50 percent.
Vibration is getting a little stronger now.
We're picking up some low-frequency noise.
- Mechanical, can you confirm?
- It looks fine to me.
STEVE: Roger. Gerry, what do you think?
- I'm still go.
People, we are still go.
What...? Something's happening.
I'm... There's...
There's a light. Do you see that?
I'm seeing some...
Something, some...
I can't tell whether it's daylight or not.
There it is again.
It's coming from the bottom.
Here, let me show you. See that?
Negative. Ellie, you're breaking up.
- Comm 1, can we boost her signal?
- Already at maximum.
GERRY:
Sixty-five percent.
The material is changing.
It's bordering on translucence.
But the system is intact.
It's gotta be some kind of electromagnetic field.
- Are you reading this?
- Negative, we're seeing only interference.
It's becoming completely translucent.
I can't describe it. I can't even explain it.
Seventy percent.
People, we have intermittent comm, but we are go.
- Initiate secondary drive systems.
GERRY: Initiating auxiliary booster sequence.
MAN:
We're go for ignition.
We have auxiliary booster ignition.
Life support, how is she doing?
We still have data. Heart and respiration are high but within limits.
Ellie, do you copy?
If you could hear, I am okay to go.
If you could hear me...
Eighty percent.
All vibration and G-levels are in the green.
Control, if you're reading me...
...I am okay to go. Okay to go,
GERRY: Eighty-five percent.
MAN: All bearing tips are on the profile.
Ninety percent. We're detecting some structural instability.
- Confirmed. Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.
I'm okay to go.
My God!
Okay to go. I'm okay.
Hundred percent target velocity.
MAN:
Steve?
Tremendous EMI levels around the Machine.
All field measurements are off-scale.
Steve, we're approaching our abort limits.
Okay to go.
I hear her!
I hear her. Barely, but she's there.
- Okay to go.
- She says she's okay to go.
Steve, we're real close.
- Electrical, reading in the core?
MAN: Internal environment normal.
Inside the core, the weather's beautiful.
I'm okay to go.
Okay to go. I'm okay to go.
STEVE:
Initiate drop sequence.
On my mark.
Ten, nine...
...eight...
...seven, six...
...five, four...
...three, two...
I'm okay to go.
Oh, God!
Ellie to Control.
Ellie to Control, do you read me?
I'm gonna try to keep recording.
I'm going through some kind of a tunnel.
There's a light source ahead.
Brilliant and blue-white.
Residual radiation?
It's a star.
I must have gone through a wormhole.
It's Vega.
I'm in another wormhole now.
I had no idea.
A series of them.
They're alive.
It's like some kind of a transit system.
It's a subway.
[YELLS]
Okay.
Okay, I've gotta keep talking.
It's a triple... No, quadruple system.
It's beautiful.
They're alive.
Another wormhole!
This one is much more violent!
Some...
...celestial event...
No...
No words. No words...
...to describe it.
Poetry.
They should have sent a poet.
It's so beautiful.
Beautiful.
So beautiful.
I had no idea.
I had no...
I had no idea.
I had no idea. I had no idea.
Hi, Sparks.
Dad?
I missed you.
Arert you...?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
You're not real.
None of this is real.
That's my scientist.
When I was unconscious, you downloaded my thoughts, my memory even.
Pensacola.
We thought this might make things easier for you.
- Why did you contact us?
- You contacted us.
We were just listening.
And there are others?
Many others.
They all...
...travel here through that transit system that you built?
We didn't build it.
We don't know who did.
No, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Maybe someday they'll come back.
All the other civilizations that you find, they come here?
Not all.
- Is this some test?
- No, no tests.
You have your mother's hands.
You're an interesting species...
...an interesting mix.
You're capable of such beautiful dreams...
...and such horrible nightmares.
You feel so lost...
...so cut off, so alone.
Only you're not.
See...
In all our searching...
...the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable...
...is each other.
What happens now?
Now?
You go home.
ELLIE:
Home?
But I have so many questions.
Do we get to come back?
This was just a first step.
In time, you'll take another.
But other people need to see what I've seen...
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.
- But I...
- Small moves, Ellie.
Small moves.
We've got video on Ellie.
Five-by-five.
STEVE:
She's through! She is in the net.
She's alive. Get the White House.
Get the president on the phone.
What's going on, Steve? How is she?
How is she?
STEVE:
Ellie, this is Control. Do you copy?
KENT: What's going on?
- I don't know. Hang on.
- She is alive.
STEVE: Put her on the PA.
Ellie, just hold on tight.
We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction...
...but the important thing is you're okay.
What?
It's all right, Ellie.
The important thing is that you're safe.
What malfunction?
What...?
What happened?
What day is this?
I'm sorry, Ellie, did you say what day?
How long was I gone?
Ellie, the IPV dropped straight through the Machine.
You didn't go anywhere.
But I did. I did go.
That's what I've been trying to tell everyone.
But the headset didn't record a single image?
Just this. Static.
Thank you.
Now, doctor, let me show you what we saw.
Forty-three separate remote cameras show exactly the same event.
The IPV dropped straight through.
Everyone who watched saw exactly the same thing.
Nothing happened.
How do you explain this, doctor?
I can't.
CLINTON:
I would encourage you...
...not to inflame this situation beyond the facts.
Let us deal with this on the facts.
We are monitoring what has actually happened.
We are taking what we believe is factually appropriate steps.
Amid a flurry of accusations and counter-accusations...
...by the nations representing the Machine Consortium...
...the president has ordered a special inquiry.
However, the appointment to the committee of Michael Kitz...
...who has recently resigned as National Security Advisor...
...has raised a number of eyebrows on Capitol Hill.
I have made no decision to run for
Congress, I have announced no candidacy.
The fact that I resigned as National Security Advisor...
...has nothing to do with anything...
...other than I want to devote all of my energy to this inquiry.
The people of the world have a right to know what really happened.
And yet every scientific instrument confirms...
...the IPV was out of contact for only a fraction of a second.
Isn't that correct, doctor?
A fraction of a second Earth time, yes.
SENATOR:
Earth time?
ELLIE: Senator, I believe that the Machine opened up a wormhole...
...a tunnel through the fabric of space-time, also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
Now, because of the effects of general relativity, what I experienced as 18 hours...
...passed instantaneously on Earth.
Isn't it true that these wormholes you speak of are merely theoretical predictions?
There is no evidence they actually exist, is there?
ELLIE:
There is no direct evidence, no.
KITZ:
Tell me something, doctor...
...why do you think these aliens would go to all this trouble?
Bring you tens of thousands of light years and then send you home without proof?
They said that's how it's been done for billions of years.
KITZ: That's very neat. You have no proof because they didn't want you to have any.
A phenomenon known in psychiatric circles,
I believe, as a self-reinforcing delusion.
Is that what you think? Delusional?
KITZ: Well, I do think you may have suffered some kind of an episode. Yeah, I do.
Doctor, I'd like to propose an alternate hypothesis...
...and I'd like you to bring your scientific expertise to bear on it.
To fake a signal from Vega...
...what would you need?
You would need a satellite to transmit the signal, but it would be impossible to...
You'd need a satellite and need launch capabilities to put the satellite into orbit.
And the message itself.
To put something like this together...
...so complex, drawing on many disciplines...
- Would be impossible.
KITZ: Impossible?
Impossible?
Is there anyone who might have been up to the challenge?
Someone with extraordinary technical expertise...
...enormous financial resources...
...someone perverse enough, eccentric enough to come up with the idea?
Hadden?
S. R. Hadden.
[CROWD MURMURING]
You're implying that this was all some kind of a hoax?
That he engineered this?
KITZ:
S. R. Hadden...
...a legendary power broker and manipulator in perhaps his final bid for immortality.
Maybe he wanted to explore and exploit new technologies...
...and get the governments to pick up the tab.
Perhaps this was his final altruistic gesture...
...to unite the world in some common goal.
Maybe all of the above.
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant and complicated man.
Doctor, are you familiar with the scientific precept...
...known as Occam's razor?
ELLIE:
Yes.
It means that all things being equal...
...the simplest explanation tends to be the right one.
KITZ:
Exactly.
Now, you tell me.
What is more likely here?
That a message from aliens results in a magical machine...
...that whisks you away to the center of the galaxy...
...to go windsurfing with your dad and a split second later...
...returns you home without a single shred of proof?
Or that your experience is the result of being...
...the unwitting star in the farewell performance of one S.R. Hadden?
A man with the means, motive and opportunity to play you and the rest of us...
...as pawns in the biggest, most elaborate, most expensive hoax of all time?
MAN:
Dr. Arroway.
You come to us with no evidence, no record...
...no artifacts.
Only a story that, to put it mildly, strains credibility.
Over half a trillion dollars were spent.
Dozens of lives were lost.
Are you really gonna sit there and tell us we should just take this all...
...on faith?
KITZ:
Please answer the question, doctor.
Is it possible that it didn't happen?
Yes.
[CROWD MURMURING]
As a scientist I must concede that.
I must volunteer that.
KITZ:
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.
You admit you have absolutely no physical evidence to back up your story?
Yes.
You admit that you very well may have hallucinated this whole thing?
- Yes.
- You admit that if you were in our position...
...you would respond with exactly the same degree of incredulity and skepticism?
Yes.
Then why don't you simply withdraw your testimony and concede...
...that this journey to the center of the galaxy in fact never took place?
Because I can't.
[CROWD MURMURING]
I had an experience.
I can't prove it. I can't even explain it.
But everything that I know as a human being, everything I am...
...tells me it was real.
I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever.
A vision...
...of the universe...
...that tells us undeniably...
...how tiny and insignificant...
...and how rare and precious we all are.
A vision that tells us that we belong to something...
...that is greater than ourselves, that we are not... That none of us are alone.
I wish I could share that.
I wish...
...that everyone, if even for one moment...
...could feel that awe and humility and hope.
But...
That continues to be my wish.
MAN 1: Dr. Arroway, get a picture, please?
Get a photo over here?
WOMAN:
Here comes Ellie.
MAN 2:
Reverend Joss! Reverend Joss!
MAN 3: Reverend Joss, what do you believe? What do you believe?
As a person of faith, I'm bound by a different covenant than Dr. Arroway.
But our goal is one and the same.
The pursuit of truth.
I, for one, believe her.
So, what happens now?
We give her a medal?
I'd say at least a healthy grant.
I assume you read the confidential report from the investigating committee?
KITZ:
I flipped through it.
I was especially interested in the section on Arroway's video unit.
The one that recorded the static.
Continue.
The fact that it recorded static isn't what interests me.
Continue.
What interests me...
...is that it recorded approximately 18 hours of it.
That is interesting, isn't it?
ELLIE: You can see over there, we're building 45 brand-new dishes.
And that means when you put them together with all the radio telescopes...
...all over the world...
...then we get to hear farther into space than anybody has ever heard before.
Yeah.
Are there other people out there in the universe?
That's a good question.
What do you think, huh?
- I don't know.
- That's a good answer.
Skeptic, huh?
The important thing is that you all keep searching for your own answers.
I'll tell you one thing about the universe, though.
The universe is a pretty big place.
It's bigger than anything anyone has ever dreamed of before.
So if it's just us...
...it seems like an awful waste of space.
Right?

Please check that your seat belt is fastened and that your chair back is in the upright position.
We'll be taking off shortly.
Kate?
Yes?
Are you prepared to have a pleasant flight?
Yes.
Tell me, Kate, what are you thinking about?
Twisted steel.
Ball of fire.
A naked baby screaming for his mother.
Kate, what happened to your little stone cottage?
Picture it now.
O.K.

Ohh, my god!
And don't forget your takeoff mantra.
What are the words you chant softly in your head?
We're going down!
We're going down!
Kate...

[SlGHS]
O.K.
I Love Paris ln the springtime
I Love...
Hello? Hello? l really think you gave me the wrong mantra.
Oh? l don't love Paris, l don't like the French, and l don't want to go on this trip.
[ENGlNES ROAR]
Oh...god, no!
Kate, you can do this. l can't do this! l don't belong on this airplane!
Let me out of here! l don't want to die!
Who-ohhh!
[ALARMS BUZZlNG FRANTlCALLY]
Kate, your full refund.
Thank you.
You can get the money back on my ticket.
Money's not the issue, Kate. l wanted you to come with me to exper... What? ls that them? l don't want to see my family tonight.
You never do.
Have you noticed how, since we're engaged, they don't knock anymore?
They love you.
My family gives me an unsigned birthday card.
Kate, come with me. l'll give you
1 0 milligrams of valium, a shot of Stoli, and we'll be there before you know it.
How can you not want to go to Paris?
You're a history teacher.
Shame on you.
Charlie, the French, you know they hate us.
They smoke.
They have a whole relationship to dairy products, which l don't understand.
[MAN] Kate, something's wrong with the cable! ls the box set on three?
A week in Paris with the man you love?
Suture demonstrations.
Midnight strolls?
Medicare meetings.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Eiffel Tower... l'd love to see the Eiffel Tower.
O.K. Then.
Great. l'm not supposed to leave the country until my immigration interview. l'm taking that.
No, no.
No, you're not.
Make something up.
Tell them your cousin Bridget fell in the Seine.
They'll find out l have no cousin Bridget and deport me.
Like the one time l smoked pot... l didn't want to, l had a horrible time, and Ronny Templeton's little brother called the police, and we got arrested.
The one time l ever did anything illegal.
Bure drops it in...
They put cheese on both pizzas.
Herb, this is you, you didn't check.
Take it back.
You know Kate hates cheese. l'll pick it off.
Here's a list of stuff l want.
Forget it.
Kate's not going. l'm not going.
Why not? ls it the
French thing?
No, it's the flying thing. lt's not the French thing or the flying thing. l'm not supposed to travel until my Canadian citizenship clears.
[CHARLlE] Hon, we got to move it.
Oh, Kate, l almost forgot, the Merediths have put their house on the market.
Why are we looking at a house we can't afford?
Charlie, there's something l have to tell you.
Since l turned 21 , l've been putting money aside every week into a savings account, which l then rolled into high-yield term deposits with interest rates close to 14 %.
Wh-what are you talking about? l've made us a nest egg.
How many eggs?
45,782 eggs.
Why didn't you tell me this before? l wanted it to be a surprise. lt's a surprise. lt's a big surprise.
So, with a little help from your parents, we could probably afford this.
My whole life is passing before my eyes, and we don't even have children yet.
Hey.
Huh?
Hey.
Come to Paris with me.
[SIREN]
[TELEPHONE RlNGS]
Hi. Right on time.
Saved me from the news.
Bonsoir, chérie.
Hey. Hi, how's it going?
Good. It's just one conference after another, but this city, it's amazing, Kate. lt's so beautiful, it just casts a spell.
How was dinner?
Mmm! They used this sauce, it had a taste l never experienced.
C'était incroyable!
The sauces have to be incroyables to cover up the horse meat. l saw this segment on
60 Minutes...
You keep watching all those shows, you'll never leave the house.
[TELEPHONE RlNGS]
Hey!
Hey. l can't talk. l'm with the guys at this hip club. l can't hear you.
Sweetie pie, we need to talk about the house. l promise you, tomorrow. l got to go, hon.
Love you. Bye.
[DlAL TONE] l talked to the broker and told her we are ready to make an offer as soon as l talk to Charlie.
You guys are crazy. l'm never buying a house or anything else worth anything.
Why not?
Because you think you own something like that, when, really, it winds up owning you. lt becomes your life, and then one night, someone leaves their cigarette, and it all burns.
[TELEPHONE RlNGS]
Honey, hello?
Kate? Kate?
Yeah, it's me, Charlie.
Are you all right? ls something wrong?
No... Yeah...
Something's happened.
What? Wh-what's wrong?
Oh, Kate...
Kate, l'm just... l'm just so happy, you know? l'm just so happy and so...
Fucked up. l fucked up, definitely.
Uh, but it's destiny,
Kate.
That's what it is.
Wha-what are you saying?
What's destiny?
Destiny... Oh, Kate.
Well, l met this woman, this apparition, this goddesse.
Goddesse?
It's French for "goddess," and so is she.
She's French. l've never, ever felt this way before.
I feeI I couId do anything. l could rule the world, climb the highest mountain. l could walk into a men's room and pee, even with some big guy waiting behind me.
Wha-what?
What are you saying?
Charlie, are you, uh...
Kate, l'm not coming back.
I'm in Iove... Kate.

SIut girIfriend
This is my first time flying. l'm just kind of nervous.
First time.
Do you speak any English?
Didn't your mother ever teach you about staring?
What do you think, the plane will crash and we are on the ground in a thousand pieces dead? l promise you, if it happens, you won't feel a thing.
You're French, aren't you?
Luc Teyssier.
How have you got around your whole life?
Or do you just stay in your house with the doors locked? l get around as nature intended,
Nous rappelons à nos voyageurs que l'usage d'appareils électroniques est interdit durant le décollage de l'appareil.
What was that?
What did she say?
That sounded serious.
The pilot says there is a crack in the engine, but he take off anyway.
Ladies and gentlemen, please remember that the use of cellular phones and other eIectronic devices is forbidden during takeoff. l don't know what they taught you in France, but rude and interesting are not the same thing.
Ohh! God!
[FLlGHT SAFETY lNSTRUCTlONS
GlVEN lN FRENCH]
Oh!
We hope you enjoy the flight.
O.K., OK., O.K...
O.K., OK...
[PlLOT]
Folks, we're third in line for takeoff, so just relax.
We shouId be in the air in just a couple of minutes. l've almost got the stone cottage going.
Could you please stop looking at me? ls incredible.
What? What?
Your every muscle in your body is tense, even the lids of your eyes.
Your nostrils are...
Are closing up.
How do you do that?
Me, l love to fly, especially this moment, the plane getting ready to charge the runway, the engines screaming, the pressure building, the force of it slams you back in the seat, and then, whoosh, you are in the air.
Everything else is behind you.
There's only one other place in life where l feel this kind of exhilaration.
Oh, yeah?
Where's that?
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Just let me guess.
Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.
Oh, god. l don't think l can do this.
[GASPlNG]
Did you ever think that maybe it is not the airplane?
What's not the airplane?
That maybe it is something else you are afraid of.
What?
Must l say it?
Can l stop you? lt is obvious to me. l know your type.
What type is that?
You're afraid to really live.
Oh, god.
You are afraid of life.
You are afraid of love.
You are afraid of sex.
That is ridiculous. l can tell from your face and how you dress with your little white buttons all the way up to here. ln bed, you are waiting under the covers, the light is going off, and then, like a rabbit...
What?
What is the matter with you?
You don't know me. l know that you are afraid...
You don't know what l do, and Charlie never complained.
Stop that.
There were a few months where l didn't feel like it.
That was a long time ago, and l was in between teaching jobs. Yes.
For you to sit there with that smug expression and tell me that l have a problem with my life and my Charlie
[ENGlNE ROARlNG]
You're just some nicotine-saturated and, sorry to say, hygiene-deficient
Frenchman!
Ah. Look...
What a fantastic view, huh?
[CHlME]
Now, if you will excuse me, l must go do as nature intended.
Pardon, monsieur.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Sir, l'm sorry, there's no smoking on this plane.
OK, then can l have two glasses with ice?
Excuse me. Can l ask you something? l-it's Luke, isn't it?
Luc.
No, not Luc... Luc.
Luc?
You want to ask me something, or no?
No. Forget it. l forget already.
Did you mean all that stuff you said, or were you just trying to anger me?
Do l look like the kind of person that doesn't know how to have a good time?
Uh, you were how old when you lost it? lt? What it?
You know, it.
Your, uh, flower.
My flower, oh.
My flower is none of your business. l ask you because some people, they rush toward the fateful moment, their bodies bursting to discover.
Others, they guard it like some precious gift, and they wait and wait.
You, l suppose, rushed.
Like a bull. l have a clear picture in my mind.
A young bull.
How young?
No, you are right. l was 1 2. Magda.
She was a putain...
A, uh...prostitute.
She lived just outside of my town, just by a little bridge.
She was, uh...
Not beautiful, but she had this mouth.
Oh, there was another world waiting there.
But l did not have the money for the kissing.
Only for the, uh...
You know. l don't understand.
To kiss a prostitute, it costs more. lt has always been.
Oh, well, that makes sense.
A kiss is so...
So intimate.
You could probably disconnect from everything else, but a kiss...
Two people's lips together, and their breath, a little bit of their souls...
A-all l mean is that a kiss is where the romance is.
Oui.
That is what l thought back then, so l stole 50 francs from my brother Antoine, and l went back, and l kissed Magda for half an hour. lt was very good.
Now you.
Now me what? lt is your turn. l tell you, now you tell me. l am all ears.
All right.
Yeah, uh...
No, l didn't... l, uh... l didn't rush, you were right, but l didn't hide from it, either. l wanted it to be great. l was, uh... 1 8.
Jeff the jock.
My basement.
Valentine's day.
Jeopardy! ln the background. lt's a game show on TV.
Mm-hmm.
Jeopardy! We have it.
Jeff said it would last longer with the show on to distract him.
He got all the answers wrong except for sports.
By double Jeopardy!, he was done.
By final Jeopardy!, he was on his way home, so...
Yeah, the first time was bad, but since then, it's been mainly good, and then l found somebody special, so it was great.
Could l ask you something?
Do you believe in love, the kind that lasts forever? l loved my mother.
No. Everybody loves their mother, even people who hate their mothers. ls one man meant for one woman?
That is the question. lt is not an interesting question. lt is the question of a little girl who believes in fairy tales. lt's an everyone question, one that everybody thinks they have the answer to, until, one day, something happens.
Something happened?
Look, l understand. l understand.
One love for you would be like having to eat home for the rest of your life...
And you probably like to go out to a different restaurant every chance you get.
Oh!
Careful, now.
What's that? lt is nothing.
Are you hiding something? l have to go.
Pardonnez-moi. l have to go again.
Again?
[HUMMlNG]
Parfait.
Tu vas bien?
VoiIà. Bonsoir.
Ah, bon.
[lNHALES]
Whew...
Why'd you let me drink so much?
Me? l did not let you do anything.
You did it yourself.
And l will give you a ride into Paris, OK.? lt will save you a lot of money, believe me.
After what we have been through together...
Where are you staying?
George V.
[WHlSTLES]
"Nothing to declare."
That is you.
Me, they're going to stop.
They always do. l meet you outside, one minute maximum.

Would you open your bag?

That won't be necessary.
What are you doing here?
Don't you think a cop gets a vacation?
Give him back his papers.
Look...there's Louise. l need a taxi to the
George V in Paris.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH] l'll call you Monday.
We'll have a drink.
Why wait till Monday? l've got something...
Never mind...let's go.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Papa, why are you looking through the man's things?
The same reason l look through your room when you're asleep.
To protect my loved ones from themselves.
You won't find anything in there.
Are you really a thief?
Me?
Daddy says you saved his life. lt's true. You see this little scar?
Luc stopped it from going all the way over here.
He's no criminal.
That's what l keep telling him.
To the left, Louise.
Oui, madame?
Yes, uh, bonjour.
Uh, do you speak any English?
Of course.
This is the George V, not some backpacker's hovel.
Hovel?
Of course not.
Could you tell me which room
Charlie Lytton is staying in, please?
Dr. Charles Lytton.
He's expecting me. l'm afraid no.
No?
No, madame.
Perhaps madame could try the courtesy phone.
Well, madame has tried the courtesy phone.
Do not disturb.
Ah.
Look, l just spent seven hours on an airplane l'm tired, and l'm hungry, and l just want to see my fiancé.
Now, are you going to help me? lt is my duty to vigorously safeguard the privacy of our guests, and if our guests need safeguarding from their own fiancées, well, after all, unlike some countries,
France is not a nation of puritanical hypocrites.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey. l just gave you
1 00 francs.
Oui, madame, and l took it.
Merci. lf there is anything else l can do, please let me know.
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
You are American, no?
For the moment.
Well, forgive me for intruding, but l saw you sitting here, looking a little sad.
Why should such a beautiful woman look so sad, l asked myself.
Have you got an hour?
As a matter of fact, always.
Let me help you to forget your sadness.
Remember you are in Paris,
City of Love.
Can l ask you something?
Of course.
Can you urinate with someone standing right behind you? l think l could manage it.
Are you going to be the someone?
Me? No. That's not what l meant.
So...
You would like that l arrange for someone else to stand next to me? lt could be arranged.
Perhaps Pierre,
Monique...
You have the face of an angel, but l'm delighted to find the mind is a little devil.
Hey, hey, look, Mister, this will get you nowhere. l'm waiting to meet my fiancé. lf he sees you bothering me, even talking to me, he'll walk right over here...
[WHlSTLlNG]
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
What are you doing here?
You only work the metro.
No more.
With this suit, l'm a new man.
[GASP]
Charlie?
Ooh...
Hey, you said you'd give me a ride.
You said...
Where are we?
Your hotel. l take you to your room. l don't have a room.
Someone has taken my room, someone in 4-inch heels, a red dress...
[SlGH]
Oh, my god.
My bags.
What?
My bags are gone.
What? They can't be gone.
How can they?
Why look under there? l didn't lose my keys. l lost my suitcase!
Wh-where did you put them down? l fainted right there.
Oh, my money, my passport, my vitamins...
May l be of service?
Où sont ses baggages?
Monsieur, je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé.
Vous me dites que les baggages de madame...
You tell him!
How could you let this happen?
What is your problem?
They're my bags!
Uh, l am upset because it is my country and this is a scandal.
Do you remember anything? l was sitting here, then that guy came and talked to me...
Then l saw Charlie.
Oh, here we go again.
Here. Sit, sit, sit.
Breathe in...
Breathe out...
Breathe in... l'm breathing!
You know, all men are bastards.
Well, some are just trying to help. l never thought l'd say this, but it's true.
All men are bastards.
The guy talking to you,
-he was...
-A bastard.
A Euro-trash-in-Armani bastard.
He wore a black suit with a yellow shirt?
Yeah.
You know him?
Come.
Of course.
All you bastards know each other.
Bastard.
All right, all right.
Uh, you wait here, l go get the...
My car, and we go get your stuff, OK.?

[ALARM STOPS]
Ah, la chienne.

Er... Bub.

No, Bub.
Bub, like, uh...

Oh. Bob.
Oui.
Bahhb.
Now, why are you helping me?
Why? Er...
Because, uh, l like you. l do...
But l don't like how you say on the plane with your face all scrunched up,
"You're French, aren't you?" l don't like how you say with your eyes all squinty,
"All men are bastards."
Scrunched?
[HORN HONKlNG]
Allons-y!
Allons-y!
Allez, allez!
Aah!
Please don't break the car, OK.?
[TlRES SCREECH]
[HORN HONKS]
O.K., so l try to understand.
He says he has met this, uh, woman, no, no.
This goddess.
Uh, he breaks your heart.
He, uh... Uh, uh...
Hurts me.
Humbles me.
Humiliates you.
Humiliates me.
So you come here to Paris so he can do it again, but this time, in your face.
No.
[CAR ALARM STARTS, STOPS]
Pardon.
No, no. l come to Paris to get back the man that l love. ls that so hard to understand, even for someone like yourself?
O.K., and meanwhile, his lover is...
Don't ever use that word again.
Uh, this bastard woman, she is feeling something else, uh, maybe, uh...
Once he saw me, myself, moi, everything would change.
The spell would be broken.
Ah.
What, you don't think l could change his mind? l would remind him we had a wonderful, perfect life together.
Evidently. l've never been so happy.
When someone says that, my ass begins to twitch.
And we had plans for a home and family. l'd remind him of that, too.
He was obviously very attached to them. lf all else failed...
You'd get down on your knees and beg? lt's possible. l can see it, there is the goddess standing next to Charlie in her negligee, and you are on your knees, begging.
Poor Charlie.
Tough decision.
AIors! l didn't beg.
No. You fainted.
Ah, laisse tomber.
Hey, Luc-a-doo!
Alors, ça marche?
Oui. l see how far you'd go for the love of your life. lf you know so much, how come no one greeted you at the airport?
Please. l'm finished with women, OK.?
Haven't found the right one? l have found plenty, believe me.
Oh. Afraid of commitment. l'm afraid of nothing. l know your problem, no staying power.
What?
You can't stick it out.
What? lt's obvious. lt is?
You are afraid of commitment.
Commitment!
Oh, OK., sorry. l thought you meant, uh...
What did you think?
Nothing. lt's OK.
Ohh, this problem. lt's not a problem!
For you, Luc?
Every man goes through that.
Charlie never did, but, you know, it's usually an issue of self-esteem. lt's just a recent phenomenon, OK.? l've been under a lot of pressure recently.
Soon it will all be over, and then zip, boom, bonjour, l'm back in business, OK.?
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Bob, great to see you.
Hi, Luc.
You've met my friend Kate?
Hello again.
Where's the rest?
Hey!
Wh-what about my money and my passport?
Uh, j'ai...
He sold the passport.
First thing to go.
Oh! What about my suitcase and my clothes?
Ask him about my vitamins.
Her clothes? l gave them to Monique.
Monique?
What? What?
What did he say?
Uh, he threw them away.
Oh, god!
Oh, man!
Ohh...
God!
Ohh...
What? No.
No, thank you.
You got rid of everything?
Except for that...
Ma petite...
Ça va?
Oh...
Papa, il est là.
[HUMMlNG]
Oui, oui, oui, ça va, ça va.
Tout va mieux.
You hid a plant in my bag?
Not just a plant.
A vine.
That's why you're helping me.
You don't give a shit about me. l'm sorry you lost your stuff, but it was not me who stole it.
What if l had gotten stopped at customs?
What would've happened then?
Don't be ridiculous.
People like you they don't stop.
Why do you think l choose you?
You'd declare a pack of chewing gum.
Please, don't ever, ever...
Never touch my vine.
You don't understand.
This...
This is my future. l'm going to make a great vineyard, and l'm going to escape this shit hole.
Donnez-moi un break.
You can't make a vineyard out of one vine.
No. Not one vine. l take this little
American vine, l mix it with others, then l make something new. l don't care. l don't care.
Why listen to you? lt's bullshit.
Everything with you is bullshit.
O.K., fine.
Go home.
Find a nice little boy you can boss around.
Only don't let him out of your sight.
How do l do that? l have no money, no ticket, no passport...
Here. Take this.
Please. l don't want your money. lt's what he got for your stuff. l don't want your money.
Now go away.
Stop following me.
O.K.
Au revoir.
Bonne chance.

You are currently a resident of Canada in the process of applying for Canadian citizenship?
My fiancé is Canadian.
Let me ask you something.
You no longer want to be an American, but you expect me to give you a new passport? ls this a trick question? l'll need a copy of your Canadian resident visa before l can process your application.
Next.
O.K.
How it works is, l ask you a question, and you comment.
You weren't supposed to leave Canada, eh?
Yeah, l know that, but an emergency situation arose, and l needed to...
What are you writing down?
Why didn't you request permission to leave for your emergency?
Well, l should have, l realize.
But an emergency, by definition, doesn't give you the time.
See, the thing is, sir, l want to be a Canadian more than anything. l want to be just like you.
Believe me. l just want to go home.
What's that?
Oh.
O.K.
Have you...
Ever been convicted...
Of a felony?
No.
Yes.
O.K.
O.K., l was at
Ronny Templeton's house, and somebody handed me...
All right, it wasn't a cigarette, peer pressure.
Peer pressure's a terrible thing when you're a girl in college.
Thing is, we just received this from a Sergeant Patton at the American Embassy. lt says you were once convicted for possession of a narcotic. ls marijuana really a narcotic? l mean, it was just the one time, and l didn't even enjoy it. l inhaled, but then l was coughing and hacking away for 1 0 minutes. l hate that.
You do?
Well, the point is is that you didn't include this information in your application for
Canadian citizenship, paragraph 5, article 1 ?
O.K.
Here's where l tell you that your request for a new residence visa has been denied.
Merci.
[LlLLY]
Yeah. He proposed to her.
He's such an asshoIe. l just can't believe it.
Do I have to be friends with JuIiette?
Lilly...
Lilly, now, stop it, all right?
He's not going to marry her.
Now, tell me everything you know.
They're going somewhere in the south of France to meet her parents, then they're getting married.
We're not even invited.
Not that l'd go...
Lilly, now, listen, O.K.?
This is very important.
Very important.
You have to tell me exactly where they're going and when, all right?
Now, just--just ask mom.
She has it all written down probably.
O.K.
You still supposed to call her mom?
Lilly!
O.K.
Mom!
Kate? ls that you, sweetheart? l've got all the information written down, but l think you can still get him at the hoteI in Paris.
[SOBBlNG]
My god, she's crying. lt's OK. l'm not crying. l'm just, um... l'm just, uh... l'm going to get him back, mom. l'm going to get him back, and l'm going to make him love me, and we're going to live happily ever after.
And l'm just crying now in, uh...
Happiness...
Because l know... l know l will, uh... l will triumph.
[SOBBlNG]
What do they call the beaches?
La cote d'azur.
What does it mean?
The blue coast.
The blue coast, lying there next to you.
Mmm, and we're going to land in Nice.
Nice?
Yes.
That's nice.
Sweet.
Ha ha ha ha.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Bob, you know how it works. lf the little fish is to survive, he must tell the fisherman...
...where the big fish are.
Forget it, l'm no rat.
You're mixing your metaphors.
Who buys the passports?
Hi there.
C'est moi.
Welcome back, madame, to the George V. lt's incredible how you do that.
The words come out
"welcome back," but the meaning is completely different. ls that a French thing or a concierge thing?
As madame wishes.
You did it again.
Tell me something, because l--l just don't get it.
Do you enjoy being that rude?
Because when you do that, it just gets underneath my skin, and it makes me completely insane!
[POUNDS BELL]
Thank you, madame, for the fascinating lesson in our cultural differences. l'm sure it would not betray my duty now to inform you that your fiancé and his friend are no longer our guests.
Well, whose guests would they be now?
The Carlton Hotel will have that happy privilege when they arrive in Cannes tomorrow.
Perhaps madame wishes to catch the last train tonight. l could arrange for a taxi very quickly.
Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Bob, l'm losing patience.
A big fish just returned from the United States.
Luc Teyssier...your friend, right?
Ask him about a stolen necklace.
He won't be hard to find.
Take a look.
You're welcome.
Allons-y! l come to make peace with your people.
So you're, uh, still after Charlie? lt is incredible. l admire your persistence. lt's so American. l am not an American. l'm a soon-to-be ex-American Canadian.
Uh, may l help you with your bag?
No, maybe not. l am feeling some very strange emotions for me.
Guilt. Remorse.
My self-esteem is rock bottom.
What can l do to say l'm sorry?
Shut up!
You haven't spent
60 seconds with me when you weren't after something.
What's it this time, buy, sell, or trade?
True, l used you a lot.
You helped me to get my vine, and l left you with nothing.
What can l do to make it up to you?
Now l'm here for you.
Typical.
Who put this here?
So l asked myself what l can possibly do to make it up to you, so l buy this ticket, and voila, here l am...
Shh! Quiet.
Oh. You come, you go, you promise one thing, you do something else.
Why should l believe you?
Because l have no reason to lie now.
Do l look like the kind...
You look like the kind who steals airplane liquor bottles, who offers a girl a ride, then has to steal a car in order to give it to her, the kind who puts a plant in a person's bag.
This is a no-smoking compartment.
O.K., l stop. Voila.
For you.
See, l'm changing, l'm growing.
We help each other. l don't need your help.
Do you have a plan for when you see Charlie?
Still no?
You're going into a battle, you have no strategy, no armor, no bullshit? l don't need bullshit to get Charlie back.
Just a little. lt might be handy.
For me, bullshit is like breathing. l stay. l help you. l promise, OK.?
Do what you want. lt's a free country. lsn't it?
Well, oui. ls--is that Charlie?
Mm-hmm.
Can l, uh...
How did you meet?
At a party. l'd just come to Toronto on a teaching exchange.
We started talking, and l had this feeling about him. lt wasn't exactly a thunderclap or a lightning bolt. lt was more like a...
Light drizzle?
You really, honestly, never had that feeling about anybody in your whole entire life? lf l did, l would not admit it.
His chin looks a little weak, if you ask me. lt doesn't, and l didn't.
Why wouldn't you admit that feeling?
Why? Look where it's got you.
Maybe if you did, you wouldn't have that little problem. lt's not a problem. lt's just a temporary...
There's something in his eyes.
Vain, it is a word, no? lt is a word.
He has beautiful eyes.
And he knows it.
You can see it in his smile.
Not even a smile.
A smirk. ls a word?
Shut up. ls it a word?
Two words, no?
Why are you chasing after him after what he's done?
Because l love him, and l'm afraid if he doesn't come back that l'll... lt'll hurt so much that l'll shrivel up and never be able to love ever again.
You say that now, but after a time, you would forget.
First, you would forget his chin, and then, uh, his nose, and after a while, you would struggle to remember the exact color of his eyes.
One day you wake up, and, pfft, he's gone, his voice, his smell, uh, his face...
He will have left you.
And then you can begin again.
Mmm.
Charlie?
Mmm.
Hey! l can't seem to get enough of this cheese, and l haven't eaten this stuff in years.
You don't look like you got much sleep.
Un café.
For some reason, l just feel incredibly refreshed. l had this dream, which l can't remember really.
You know when you have a dream that is just delicious and you wake up and you feel all transformed?
God, it's beautiful here.
Merci.
Did you know that there are 452 official government cheeses in this country?
Don't you think that's incredible, to come up with 452 ways of classifying what is basically a bacterial process?
You would prefer one cheese, one cheeseburger to put it on, and one restaurant to eat it in? l'm saying l like the cheese.
God!
What side of the train did you wake up on?
God, it's beautiful here!
What? What's that face?
You don't think it's beautiful?
You don't think this is beautiful?
[MUMBLES]
What? l was born here.
Really?
But this is so beautiful and so charming.
Ah, oui. lt was too beautiful for me, l had to leave.
Oh, god.
Oh, god!
[BURPS] What? l'm going to die.
What, what, the cheese?
Don't say it.
Stop that rocking.
Stop the rocking. l can't. lt is the train. lt's here.
The mucus is here.
The mucus?
The mucus coating the intestinal wall.
Spasm!
Uhh!
No, no, no.
Look at the scenery, the cows...
Oh, please, not the cows.
Not the cows? l just ate that cow.
There it is.
Here we go.
Lactose... lntolerance!
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Jacques Taranne?
Non. l know you...
Phillipe Cazal?
Non.
Michel Desbordes?
Listen, gramps, you don't know me.
Leave me alone, OK?
[TOlLET FLUSHES]
You are feeling better now, huh?
Better.
The cow is all gone?
When's the next train?
Not for two more hours.
Good. l think l need to walk.
No, no, no.
Bad idea.
Sit. We wait for the train.
Got to walk.
But...
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Luc Teyssier! That's it!
My stomach is so sensitive.
That's where l put all my stress.
Ohh!
Beautiful!
Gorgeous.
Wish you were here.
Wow! How long since you've been back?
Uh, about six years.
Six years? ls your family a nightmare or something? l don't really want to talk about it, OK.?
A healthy person is someone who expresses what they're feeling inside.
Express, not repress.
You must be one of the healthiest people in the world.
You know what happens to people who shut everybody out?
They lead, uh, quiet, peaceful lives?
No, they fester.
Fester? l am festering? lnside.
Fester and rot. l've seen it happen.
You'll become one of those hunchbacked, lonely old men sitting in the corner of a crowded cafe mumbling to yourself.
[FRENCH ACCENT]
My ass is twitching.
You people make my ass twitch.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
[SlGHS]
Excuse me.
Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici?
Hey!
Attends, attends.
Attends quoi?
Attends.
Attends!
Uhh!
Wait.
Who is that?
Uh, it's my brother.
Your brother?
My brother Antoine.
Antoine, this is Kate.
C'est fini. Au revoir.
What's happening?
All of this vineyard is Antoine's. lt has been in our family for three generations. lt is who we are, what we do.
But for Antoine, l don't know, he is always sober.
That's a bad thing?
He makes the wine but never drinks it.
You always drink it.
Now, why isn't part of this yours?
Uh...hmm.
My father, uh, when he retired, he left it, uh, to Antoine and me.
Uh, but now it is all Antoine's. l don't get it.
Mmm, to make a great wine, you must have the soul of a gambler.
You like to drink, and you like to gamble.
Sometimes l would lose a lot.
Sometimes l would lose to Antoine...
My dog, my first car.
This vineyard.
Uh, oui, this vineyard, uh... lt was, uh...
One night, he got me, uh, very drunk.
You must understand, l owed him a lot of money.
He knew what he was doing.
What was he doing?
Uh, l lost all of it, one hand of poker.
Ha ha ha ha.
You lost your birthright in one hand of poker? l'm an asshole.
What can l tell you?
Uh-huh. So that's why he hates you and you hate him.
Ah, oui.
That, and l, uh, ha ha, slept with his wife.
What about your parents and the rest of your family?
Uh, no, there is nothing between us. lt is all over, finished.
What if you tried again?
No, it's not possible.
They hate me, they despise me, they...
Eh, Luc revient!
C'est toi, fils.
Papa.
Papa?
Yes, thank you.
All right, come on.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH] l'm very impressed.
She's a friend, just a friend.
Since when are women just your friends?
Since l met her.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH] l'm finished.
Fester, fester, fester.
Rot, rot, rot.
Poor you.
You had to grow up here.
Show me your room.
Hmm!
Hmm.
Ha ha.
What's this?
Uh, it is a project l did a long time ago in school.
What is it?
All right, l will tell you, but, um...
First you must take some wine.
Can you, uh, uh, describe it, the taste? lt's a nice red wine. l think you can do better.
A bold wine with a hint of sophistication and lacking in pretension.
Actually, l was just talking about myself. l--l don't know.
No, no, you are not wrong.
Wine is like people.
The vine takes all the influences in life all around it. lt absorbs them, and it, uh, gets its, uh, personality.
Here.
Smell.
Rosemary.
Some kind of mushroom?
Very good.
Currant, cassis, mint, lavender, they're all in the ground here and in the air.
Now, taste the wine again.
Close your eyes.
Hmm. The currant... l can taste that right away, and, uh, from the brown bottle, lavender? lncredible.
And you made this box?
Ah, oui. lncredible.
Thanks.
Oh! Whose house is that? lt's abandoned.
No one comes here anymore.
The guy who had this place, he gave up a long time ago.
Look.
See this, uh, earth? lt's been resting.
Now it's good.
Someday, l, uh, l'm going to buy this land. l'm going to make a great wine, right here on this wreck of a vineyard.
So you'd risk everything for this?
Oui.
Do anything to have it?
Oui.
Get down on your knees and beg?
Oui.
Then what makes you so different from me?
Admit it.
Not much.
O.K., l admit.
O.K.
Mmm! lt's beautiful here. l will help you get your Charlie back. lf you want him back, we'll get him back, like l promised.
Papa!
Ohh!
Luc!
Oui.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Tu reves.
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Tell me something, Luc, how do you plan to buy that vineyard?
You must have a plan, some strategy.
Oui, l had a plan, but it did not work out. lt didn't work out?
What was the plan? l, uh, had something to sell.
Something?
Like what?
Stocks, bonds, a little bag of plutonium? lt doesn't matter. l lost it.
You lost it? lf it was me, l'd have some kind of backup plan, something more than just bullshit to fall back on.
Something, perhaps, maybe a little bit...
Like this?
Oh...
Luc, are you coming?
Lesson number one, before going into a war, you must choose carefully the field of battle.
Also, never let Charlie see how much you desire him.
Never tell someone that you want them.
You see that?
What's that, that pout?
Juliette did that. l remember that perfectly.
The pout is the French women's greatest weapon.
What's so great about that? lt's provocative. lt puts the man in a constant state of excitement and anxiety.
She can say "yes" when she means "no"
And vice versa.
Do you understand?
No.
You don't?
Gotcha.
Now, most important, when Charlie sees you, he will be expecting a big scene, a drama.
You will not give him the satisfaction.
This will make him immediately intrigued.
Luc, Luc.
What?
Look what l found. lt made me think of you.
Ohh!
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
M. Antoinne Teyssier.
Oui.
How will you be paying, sir?
When would you like to have the wedding?
Next weekend.
Next weekend?
Ha ha ha. ls there something wrong, Charlie?
No. No, l... l swear l just saw Kate. l'm sure it's just your imagination. ll y a quelque chose qui ne va pas?
Non, tout va bien.
¡A va.
Tell me, what does your father do?
Well, he's a doctor...
[CLEARS THROAT]
Like me.
Except he's a psychiatrist. l'll be right back.
Please, Charlie, sit down.
Uh, excusez-moi.
Pardon.
Huh?
Mais qu'est-ce que tu fais, Charlie?
My parents are watching. l'm sure l just saw Kate.
Mais non. Arrete.
Come with me now.
You really don't understand me.
How can l help you win back this ridiculous man if you act like a clown? lt was an accident,
OK.? l wasn't expecting to see him right then.
Sucking up to her parents... ln that outfit.
Ugh! And did you see her, huh?
Cutting her food into tiny, little chewable pieces like that.
Oui, l saw her.
She was, uh...
She was what?
Well, she was, uh...
Ah. O.K., l know what you're saying. l'm not sexy enough.
No, l did not say anything. l'm supposed to be this pouty little girl who says "yes" for "no" and "no" for "yes." l cannot do it, OK.?
Happy, smile.
Sad, frown.
Use the corresponding face for the corresponding emotion.
But you?
No, you want a mysterious, sexy, manipulative... lt is not me. l don't want it.
What do you want? l want you! l want you...
You want me...
Uh, l want you to...
Uh...
Make Charlie suffer...
To be tempted. l want you to make him feel like even though you are right there in front of him, he can't have you.
That's all.
Luc?
Oui?
[SlGH]
Do you, uh...
Oui?
Do you think l still have a chance with Charlie after what happened earlier?
Yes, of course.
And, um, tomorrow, we will turn your mistake to our advantage.
We wiII?
Oui, because he will still be wondering, did he see you?
You wiII be like a ghost, a phantom.
And it will infect them, their rapport.
Well, when do l confront him?
Just when they are starting to look comfortable again.
Ah.
Then you attack.
-Hi.
-Kate!
Hi.
Oh, can l sit with you guys?
But of course.
Please have a seat.
Uh...
Pardonnez-moi.
Pay no attention to me.
So...
You must be Juliette.
Yes, l'm Juliette.
Let me take a good look at the woman who stole my Charlie's heart.
Nothing that did not want to be stolen.
Ooh... Ouch.
She's smart, Charlie.
And beautiful and probably great at everything.
Look, Kate...
Charlie, relax. l didn't come here for a fight.
Hello, waiter.
-Madame.
-Hi. l don't speak much French.
A sea breeze.
Does that translate?
Un sea breeze.
Bien, madame.
French waiters, if you're nice, they treat you like shit.
Treat them like shit, they love you.
Juliette, s'il vous plait,
Ies carottes?
Voila.
Merci.
What?
Nothing. You just seem so different.
Well, Charlie... l'm going through some sort of transitional thing.
After you called, l decided to get to Paris and get you back. l hate to fly. Never fly, right, Charlie?
But l told myself no way would everything l've been building toward be destroyed because some pouty little...
And this is before l knew you personally.
...bitch wanted to steal herself a husband.
So l bought the ticket, boarded the plane, somehow made it over the ocean, and then the most extraordinary thing happened.
What?
Everything went wrong.
So l was wandering the streets of Paris, penniless, without a hope in the world.
And, let me tell you, you can do a lot of soul-searching in a time like that. l realized that l've spent most of my adult life trying to protect myself from exactly this situation.
You can't do it.
There's no home safe enough, no relationship secure enough.
You're just setting yourself up for an even bigger fall and having an incredibly boring time in the process.
Sorry, Charlie.
Oh.
Thank you.
That's when l took up with Luc.
Luke?
Luc.
Oh!
There he is.
Luc! Come on over. l want you to meet some great people.
Ahh.
Luc, the lovely Juliette.
Enchantée.
Enchanté.
Charlie, Luc.
Enchanté.
Sweetie pie...
Oui.
[GASPS] Ohh, la la la la la.
Voila.
Maintenant je comprends tout.
What did he just say? l don't know.
He doesn't speak much English, but we seem to manage just fine.
Yeah?
Yeah. l think it's that transitional thing, to help me get over us.
That's probably it, but... What the hell?
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH] l love the sea, so beautiful... so mysterious... so... full of fish.
What does he do?
Besides what we do together? l don't think he does anything at all.
Huh.
Oh!
That was so great!
Hi there.
You were fantastic... lncredible.
They were completely destroyed.
Oh, that was amazing! l just feel released!
Now, tonight, you will have dinner with Charlie, pretending to, uh...
Work out the details of the breakup.
By tomorrow, l promise you, you will be queen of the castle again.
We must celebrate.
Some wine, champagne.
Ah. Don't move.
O.K.
A beautiful day to be in Cannes... lsn't it, Kate? l'm sorry. Do we know each other?
No, but we have a mutual acquaintance,
Luc Teyssier.
That's why l come talk to you about a necklace.
Oh.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
The necklace.
He was silly, and he didn't declare it.
Will it be a large penalty he'll have to pay?
So why don't you just arrest him? l'm old-fashioned. l owe him a large debt much bigger than the debt of money.
So l ask you to talk to him. lt can be returned to me tomorrow, anonymously.
He'll never agree.
He must.
Call me tomorrow. lt really is a beautiful day. l hope you're able to enjoy it.
This is where l will sell my necklace tomorrow.
Your necklace.
Oui, my necklace. lt was, uh, my grandmother's necklace.
She lived in San Francisco.
When she died, she left it to me.
O.K., sure. Why not?
Luc?
Oui?
What if l sell the necklace?
You? What do you mean? Why?
Why? Because l am me, and you are...
You. l mean, if l go into Cartier...
All dressed up, looking just so, smiling your little smile, walking your little walk.
That would be better.
Thank you.
What do you mean, my little walk?
Oh, just the way you walk, you know? lt's like a woman and a little girl.
No, it's not.
You want something to drink?
O.K. Great. l'll be out in a second.
[DOOR OPENS]
Bought it at the store downstairs.
You look wonderful.
Was it expensive?
Yeah.
You charged it to the room?
Oui.
Good. No problem. l only wish my brother could see you. lt only needs one thing.
You will wear this tonight. l don't think that's such a good idea.
Oh, no, l insist. lt will be your charm...
Your good luck charm.
Baisse Mon Coeur
D'une Longeur
Mon Automne
Who is the goddess now?
Now...
We practice. l will be Charlie.
[TURNS UP MUSlC] l'll be Kate.
Ah.
So we are dancing. l realize how much l need you. l am thinking, l am an idiot, a fool, a chinless, mindless...
OK., O.K. l get the idea.
O.K. So we are dancing.
Mm-hmm. lt feels...
So right.
Now, what do you say to me? l don't know anymore.
You don't? l don't know when to stop pretending. l mean, when do l tell him that...
That you love only him...
And still you want him.
You will know the moment.
You will tell him, and that will be that.
You know what l am going to do for you to ensure victory?
What's that?
Juliette.
Juliette?
She will be feeling a little sad tonight...
A little angry...
A little vulnerable. l will find her, and l will...
Comfort her.
Well, l wouldn't want you to do anything too unpleasant. l do it for you.
Well, what about your little...
Ah, my little problem will not be such a problem tonight.
Suddenly, l'm feeling like you, relaxed. l will, uh, go to her. l will find her and talk to her...
Shh, shh, shh!

DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME] l keep the bonsai.
The lamp we got in New York is yours.
The living room love seat...
Tell me if you think this is crazy.
Right down the middle with a chain saw! Bzzz!
Make two chairs.
Can we not talk about this? lt's depressing, isn't it? lt's business, the business of breaking up. lf you can't handle it, l can sell everything and send you half the cash.
You must hate me. l don't. The CDs will be tough, though.
Why don't you just let me have them?
You don't hate me?
No. Oh, l did,
Charlie. l really did, but...
Now...
Huh. No.
Kate. l...
Oh, sweetie, are you crying?
No.
No, no. l, uh, l'm... Ahem.
You know, l just feel so totally, horribly guilty.
Listen, don't feel guilty, because then l'll start feeling guilty that l made you feel guilty, and...
You know...
Actually, that was the old me.
Just feel guilty.
Swim in it till your fingers get all pruny.
You're amazing.
You really are.
Hmm.
[SlNGlNG lN FRENCH]
Kate.
Will you dance with me?
Just...
One last dance?
Please?
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
You're right about his chin.
Sometimes l want to hit it.
He's a waste of your time.
No, he's wonderful...
...so tender.
Not like a French man.
You know what l mean?
Yes, l understand.
How could he do this to me?
When l was younger...
...this wouldn't have happened.
He would be with me in my room and she would wait all night. l can imagine.
Look at me, please.
Tell me what you see.
Hmm.
You seem so different...
But the same. lt's like somebody turned a light on inside you.
Why wasn't it me?
[SlNGlNG lN FRENCH]
Mmm!
Unh!
Unh.
Mmm!
Ohh!
Mmm!
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH] ls something wrong?
No, in fact everything is fine.
[CHARLlE]
Wait a second.
Please forgive me. l must have been insane.
Mmm!
Luc...
Oh, Kate...
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
What did you just say? l said "Kate."
[KATE]
Ohh!
Oh, Kate!
Stop.
Yeah. Oh, darling.
Ow!
-Charlie...
-Mmm!
Oh! l said...
Stop!
Ow!
What? Ohhh...
Charlie...
What? What?
Why wasn't it you who turned on the light...
The big shining
Kate light that burns so bright now that you can't resist dumping your new girlfriend for your old one?
What?
1 2 hours ago, all you wanted was Juliette.
Juliette? l...
She's wonderful...
Exciting.
And...
When l met her, l wasn't thinking.
Sometimes you just do things.
You don't think about them.
You just need to do them, do what you're feeling.
Maybe... Maybe l was just... l was afraid, afraid of where we were headed.
You know? l was afraid of getting married.
Charlie?
Hmm?
You weren't afraid of getting married to her.
You know, no matter what l might seem like tonight, it's still the same old me from yesterday you'd wind up with tomorrow...
The same old me who wants the home and the family, who wants to plant some roots and see them grow.
You want to be a farmer?
Sorry.
There's just one thing l don't want anymore. l'm sorry, Charlie.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Yeah, it's open.
Good morning.
So how did it go?
What happened?
Well, he wants to come back.
Congratulations.
What about you?
The old bull back in business?
Oh... Pfff.
Olé.
We better get going.
Cartier is waiting.
Merci.
Everything as you said.
The egg?
Nest egg.
Oui. lt was wired from your bank in Toronto, and Cartier's agreed to issue the check in exchange.
The illusion is complete.
Thank you.
Why are you doing this?
You're not with Luc.
You will probably never see him again. l don't know. l must come to Canada someday.
You are a very sympathetic people.
Well, l'm not really a Canadian. ln fact, l'm...
Currently without country.
Just out of curiosity...
What is it worth? l would say over $1 00,000.
What do... Do... Do...
This is not possible!
Wha... Ohhh!
Pourquoi?
Why did l listen to you and your little walk and... Ohhh!
He said there was a flaw.
-A flaw?
-Some flaws.
Some flaws?
Right. He said they're beautiful diamonds, but officially, there are these flaws.
Sorry. lt's O.K. lt's O.K.?
Oui. lt is, um, not as much as l was hoping, but it is enough to buy the land and to start the planting. lt will take longer, maybe six years before we have a decent bottle, but...
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're my angel of luck.
Who would have thought it? l have to go...
'Cause Charlie's waiting.
No, l d... l love you!
[MAN ARGUlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY] l had dinner with her...
[lNDlSTlNCT]
[JULlETTE] Why don't you go back to her?
You went up to the room like a freed stri...
Juliette!
[SPEAKlNG FRENCH]
Ah love, it's wonderful.
What are you doing here?
Some guy paid his hotel bill with a stolen credit card. l've taken care of it.
That's not true love.
What do you know?
Would you like to hear a true love story? l know a good one.
Really?
Does it have a happy ending? l don't know.
Maybe you can help with the ending.
Me?
Yes. lmagine...an airplane.
[LUC]
Kate?
[GASP]
Yes?
You are not afraid to fly anymore?
You are thinking of your little stone cottage? lt's on a hillside next to a beautiful vineyard.
But that's not really what l'm thinking about.
What are you thinking about?
You.
And l am thinking...
You should not be flying anywhere. l shouldn't? ln fact, l am sure of it.
You are? l am thinking... l want you...
You want me...
That's all. l want you.

MALE ANNOUNCER ON RADIO:
The Lone Ranger!
MAN 1 ON RADIO: The makers of FIeischmann's High Vitamin Yeast present
I Love A Mystery.
MAN 2 ON RADIO:
Hop Harrigan,
America's Ace of the Airwaves!
MAN 3 ON RADIO: A big howdy-do and how-are-you from Chicago, Illinois, where we're about to bring you the Cinderella story of 1939.
That's right. Local radio station WBN may be small, but they've got a lot of big dreams.
And tonight, those dreams could come true as they go nationwide in their revolutionary attempt to create a fourth national radio network.
Oh, Miss Henderson, the Biff Blaster, Space Ranger script is a minute and a half over, and Mr. Whalen doesn't know what he should do.
Well, lose all the exploding asteroids, give the Venusians one-syllable grunts.
Have you seen the General?
No. ljust want you to know that I'm not just a page.
You know,
I'm a man of many talents, and if you ever give me a chance to prove myself, you won't be sorry, Miss Henderson. Mrs. Henderson.
Her name is Mrs.
Right, Mr. Henderson.
Not now, Roger. I don't have time to be talked out of divorcing you.
"Hiya, Roger, that's a swell suit. Oh, the dog says hello,
"and, say, what's that last thing? Oh, yes,
"my life has no meaning without you."
Suit up, fellas.
Yes, ma'am.
Penny, this is me. Remember?
The joint checking account, the little hairs on the sink, you know.
How can you throw away everything we have?
Had, Roger. Past tense.
Speaking of tense,
I'm busy.
I'm trying to stay on top ofthings around here.
(DRUM BEATING) I always liked you on top...
Ofthings.
He didn't let me finish.
Walt!
Walt!
Yes.
I can't do this scene in the Second Act.
It's terrible!
It's unmotivated...
Calm down, boys.
Clive, you're absolutely right.
Now, the problem as lsee it is this...
Kill him in the first act.
We'll have one more go at it.
Has anyone seen the General?
On stage.
On stage.
Let's go, men.
No time for slackers.
Thirty minutes to combat.
Chest out, shoulders back.
Little more spit on that shine.
Excuse me, General, sir, you're needed back in your office.
Can't lead the troops from the rear.
It's about the script, it's Mr. King.
Carry on, men.
Our sponsor wants to give us a well-deserved pat on the back.
The most revolting, moronic and insipid trash
I've ever read in my life.
And, General, I expect you to do something about it.
Calm down, Bernie.
We're open to suggestions. Damn right you are. And here are mine.
Billy! Billy, my baby!
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
Hi, Son.
Best row in the house.
Looks like we're finally going on the air.
Let's check the tower voltage and turn on the generators.
Those scripts stink!
They're not funny.
Here, look at this one.
A philosophy professor who murders people by convincing them they don't exist?
It's satire, Mr. King.
It's crapola, Mrs. Henderson!
I am General Wha|en's biggest sponsor, young lady.
And if! pull out, the others will follow.
You heard him, Henderson. Double-time. Yes, sir.
It's so silly, isn't it? The little disagreements couples have?
Little disagreements?
You had an affair, Roger, with the station manager's wife.
I told you 100 times nothing happened.
Right, with an actress billed as the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl.
It's not my fault she's done the classics.
Everything was fine, everything was jake, and you had to throw it all away for one night of pleasure.
Well, believe me, sister, there was no pleasure.
Spare me your shortcomings.
Penny, Penny, did you hear what King just did?
He threw out halfthe scripts.
He threw out halfthe scripts.
Someone ought to stand up to him.
Someone ought to stand up to him.
Five primetime scripts, he just gives them the heave-ho.
For the love of Mike, will you say something?
Fix your rug.
Oh, my God.
Mr. General Whalen Junior, sir. Yes.
You're the director.
Yes.
This is no time to panic. Can you think of a better time?
Five scripts!
Five scripts!
Don't! Tell that S-O-B King to do his own rewrite!
Gentlemen, lady, please, a little decorum.
What's going on in here?
You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
Penny's just doing herjob. Now, let's give her a little support.
Let's put our shoulders to the wheel, and, you know, do whatever it is
Penny wants us to do.
That's not funny. Listen, kids, I know this stinks.
I know you've been working on those scripts for six months, and I know we go on the air in 15 minutes.
But somehow, you gotta take these cockeyed notes and make them magic.
You'll get paid overtime.
She's right.
That's the word.
Am I a complete raving lunatic, or have we not been paid anything in the last three weeks?
Can't both be true?
ZOLTAN: The knife in the back.
The sound of the human head smashing.
No. Something is not quite right.
Try honeydew.
Good idea.
CLAUDETTE: Because
I'm your wife, that's why!
And next time you send me flowers, spell my name right!
Oh, hey... Thank you very much, I was...
Oh, Mr. Katzenback, Ruffles said he'd like to speak to you right away.
Said you'd know what it was about.
Ruffles?
Ruffles?
Ruffles. Trumpet player. Oh, please, that horn-blowing...
Now, you listen to me, Junior.
Don't you think that I don't know what's going on, because I do know, and now you know that I know.
Listen, I don't know what you know that I know, but I do know that you don't know what you think you know.
Oh, no?
No.
Come on, Penny, back to the booth.
Clearly, this man is an idiot.
Sir?
Yeah?
Wrong way.
Oh.
Please.
Okay, so he leans over and he kisses the moose, and then...
And he says what?
"Honey, I kissed a moose!"
Forget the moose! I could care less about the moose!
I got something else that he could kiss.
All this work without a day's pay!
I think my head's gonna explode!
No. Still not the sound ofthe head smashing.
That's it.
To all the local stations who have affiliated with us, be assured that I have assembled a top-notch squadron of professionals, redefining the phrase
"grace under fire."
Help!
Miss Henderson? Have you seen her? No.
Miss Henderson?
Anyone seen Miss...
Billy.
Oh, Mr. Whalen Junior, sir.
Yes.
They don't know whether they're opening on the announcer or the music.
Oh, that's right. I forgot to make up my mind about that one. ok3Y-
Forty seconds to air, and where the hell is our director?
Okay, I got it. Decision made. Problem solved.
Thirty seconds, Max. That's good. That's good news.
Here we go.
And now, gentlemen, I give you America's newest network,
WBN.
Junior, what are we opening with, music or announcer?
Okay, cue the...
TOMMY: 5, 4, 3...
Cue the announcer!
Cue the announcer.
Cue Dexter.
DEXTER: Clear the airwaves.
Clear the airwaves.
And from the four corners of this great country, the Whalen Broadcasting
Network says,
"Hello, America! "
Please welcome the Rick Rochester Band with The Dead Tones and the lovely
Miller Sisters.
But first, gather up the kids and caboodle and stay with us till the stroke of 12:00, for an evening ofeverything but the kitchen sink.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Oh, well, it sounds like we have that, too.
Believe you me, folks, we've got a night full of surprises.
MAN: "Dig and dig to find some dirt
(LAUGHING) "Dig too deep and you'll get hurt"
Something cut in?
Well, that's not right.
What went wrong, Max?
Must have been an open mike.
No, no, no.
I only have one pot open.
Cue the band.
Cue the band.
(SINGING LOVE IS ON THE AIR
TONIGHT)
I hate opening nights.
Aunt Millie's.
Stand by, Aunt Millie's.
Watch that overload.
Zoltan, you got a pen?
Thanks, pal.
Max, promise me nothing else is gonna go wrong tonight.
Promise.
We've got a show, people.
MAN: Out!
No writers backstage.
What a ham.
Get him off.
Close the curtain.
Close the curtain.
Cue the commercial.
Cue the commercial.
He's dead.
Stand by, Black Whip.
Will you stop fussing?
Hate to be a stickler for detail, but we don't have a script.
We don't have... We don't have a script? Where is Roger?
Billy, would you get to the writers‘ room?
Tell Roger we need that script right away.
Right. You can count on me,
Miss Henderson.
Through rain, snow, sleet...
Billy, beat it!
Keep going.
So the Black Whip hits him on the head with his log.
Dad, he doesn't have a log, he has a whip.
If he had a log, he would be known as the Black Log.
What do you expect me to do, improvise?
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.
Let's get back to what we're not getting paid for.
This ending is strictly phonus-balonus.
Can't we find a fresh way out of this?
Let's think...
He could hug him.
Hug him?
Hug him?
Yeah. Tell him they're long lost brothers and make him his partner.
Morgana, you did it again.
You know, she did it again! Let's go, let's go!
We lost him.
Not again.
Not again.
This is just horrible!
Not really.
Catch your head in a threshing machine, now that's horrible.
How convenient.
Oh, shut up.
Out of the way! Out of the way! Watch it, Billy.
This new ending's gonna knock them dead. Hey, you guys, where's the...
Script?
MAN: Move! Move!
Come on, go!
We've got to talk, Junior.
Not now.
Gangway! Coming through!
Coming through!
Hot script coming through!
Hang on to your toupee,
Junior.
MAN 1: Hi, Roger.
No, no, no. I'm okay.
I want my script! I will not go on without my script!
MAN 2: Sorry, Mac.
This way out, guys.
It's amazing people don't get killed around here.
Moley hokes! Ruffles is dead.
I can't believe it.
Hey-
Hey, you need a fill-in on trumpet?
Just keep her on, keep her on. Get her back on.
It's incredible. The woman's been doing the same damn thing over and over and over again for five minutes.
MAN: Get this stiff out of here.
The girl has about
30 seconds before she drops.
Five bucks says you're wrong. You got it.
Fellas, wait!
Hey!
Mr. H, where'd you go? Come on, Penny needs that script now!
Roger!
Oh, God.
Well, she brought down the house.
Let's go straight to another commercial.
Cue the King commercial.
Cue Dexter.
Well, we all know the Black Whip's unbeatable, as unbeatable as a bottle of King brew beer.
Is the Black Whip standing by?
BLACK WHIP: I don't care if their sponsors are here!
I asked for a big gun and they give me this silly little teeny one!
Phil sounds nice and relaxed.
Roger, where the hell have you been?
The, the...
What? Spit it out!
The lights were against me.
Go!
And like the Black Whip, it's strong.
Oh! The typist.
Nice of you to join us!
Phil.
Thirty seconds, Phil.
That filthy mess is my script?
DEXTER: Some pals are dropping by after a day at the ballpark.
Which beer will replenish their zest and bring that sparkle back to their eye?
Look, Phil, come on, cut it out!
Fifteen seconds.
Fifteen seconds!
Cue the organ.
DEXTER: The Black Whip.
Cue curtain.
They call me the Black Whip.
The other way. The other way.
Are you all right?
Oh, peachy, now.
I could use a hand up, though.
Well, looks like we lost the evil Freeman gang, Happy.
Let's ride the DBs on this whip crack.
BLACK WHIP:
I don't like it, Happy.
It's too darn quiet out there.
Listen, nothing but crickets.
HAPPY: Look out for that rattlesnake, Black Whip!
Hand me my whip, Happy.
You got him, Black Whip.
Oh, no, the Crazy Gulch Gang!
(GUN FIRING) Here they come. They're shooting at us!
Lookit. Oh, no!
Knock it off, Roger.
Have you finished the Gork: Son ofFire script yet?
It's percolating.
Well, bring it to a boil.
Oh, come on, Penny. Okay, okay. Now, here's how I figure it.
We met working on the radio, we got married working on the radio.
We can't get divorced. You might end up marrying out ofthe medium.
PENNY: Great idea.
Someone with less imagination.
Less imagination?
Have you seen Walt Junior?
No, ma'am.
Where the hell is he?
Well, excuse me, operator, I think I have a bad connection.
And, say, if it's Claudette you're talking about, that was your imagination!
My imagination!
I saw you locked together in her dressing room like Siamese twins attached at the zipper. But she attacked me.
What? Assault with a friendly weapon? You were lying on top of her.
Oh, now, come on, Penny. She took me down with a headlock.
I never knew what hit me.
Your shirt was off! It ripped on the hat rack when I fell!
Well, she wasn't wearing a stitch!
Breakaway evening gown?
Okay, okay, so the woman holds the land speed record for stripping.
What is it, sweetheart?
Well, I...
Mr. Ruffles...
I mean, I know nobody liked him, and he drank and all, but I'm just thinking about his wife and his four kids, and it's just so awful.
Ruffles is dead?
This is no time to give up.
We're all wearing our Thermic Molecular Transometer suits.
They should protect us in our quest to thwart the Neptunian lava monster.
BETTY:
Biff, it's getting closer!
Jumpin'jiminy gee whiz, Biff!
Quiet, Jimmy.
There's no time for that now.
Betty, let me check your tubes.
Check anything you want, Biff.
After all, the future of the universe depends on you.
Okay, okay, so you don't believe me.
But if you just give me a chance, I'll prove it, Penny.
Prove to me you can rewrite
Home is Where the Heart Aches.
For Pete's sake, come on. I need that script in 12 minutes, Roger.
You'll get your rewrite and proof positive there's no funny business between Claudette and me.
PENNY:
Wabash 3-1800, please.
Did you happen to find us a director?
Mrs. Reedy?
Oh, standby, Polka Minute.
No, no, Claudette. What about Ruffles? You big octopus.
ROGER: Claudette.
Caught me at a bad time, kid. I'm in.
So am I.
Nobody enters my dressing room uninvited.
What the hell do you think that star means?
You're Jewish?
I don't have time to mince words, Claudette. I want my marriage back.
And you're gonna get it for me, tonight, when you tell Penny what really happened.
Scram, scribbler, you're boring me.
Here. Is that what you want? Huh?
You want me to beg?
I'm so deep in the doghouse, I'll beg, I'll fetch, I'll roll over.
What more can I do,
Claudette?
I'm risking everything just coming here.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) If I'm caught with you again...
I'm a dead man.
HERMAN: Claudette?
Oh, God, it's my husband.
Herman, I told you, I don't like to be disturbed before a show or after a show or at home in my bedroom when I'm thinking about a show!
I spoke to Ruffles before he died.
What do you mean?
Who is that?
No, not under there. Geez, I could have sworn I left that script...
Oh, hiya, Herman.
I didn't hear you come in.
You! What is this weasel doing in here?
Maybe it blew over there.
What do you think?
Roger!
About that script change you wanted me to run past Penny, would after the show be soon enough?
After the show? Sure.
Sure. Great.
Well, guess I'll get back to the old word factory.
Leave you two alone.
All by yourselves.
Good night.
Later.
WOLFGANG:
Shocking, isn't it, my dear?
No, Wolfgang, don't!
Can't you see you're mad?
Mad? Mad, you say?
But I'm the one with the branding iron, and you're the one with the soft, pink flesh.
Now talk!
Okay, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.
It's paprika.
Paprika is the secret of my potato salad.
Paprika?
Hey, quick rewrites.
Those writers are pros.
Once they warm up, they'll start hitting them out ofthe park.
...Pontiac running board wasn't as good as the Chevy.
Dad, do you wanna shut up about the car?
Please, I need a script now!
Wait a minute, wait a minute! There's one!
MAN 1: That's one ofthe good ones. MAN 2: You almost lost it.
Take this one, kid.
Great.
That was easy. Wait a minute. This is Tom Adventure.
They need Home is
Where the Heart Aches.
MAN: Home is Where the Heart Aches!
Two minutes, no script.
And no director.
I could yell "fire" over the intercom. We could call it a night.
Hey, wait a minute, this is good stuff. Who put this in the garbage?
I did. It stinks.
That's yesterday's script.
Okay, now we're cooking with gas. That's a great script.
Well, hello.
This is sensational!
That's the best. okay...
Terrible. FATHER: No wonder it was in the garbage.
Roger, this is terrible. This is bad. This is bad stuff.
I found it, Jules.
It belonged to Ruffles.
Oh, if you're gonna be a serious gin-hound,
I recommend that you develop some taste.
This is rat poison.
Oh, what the hell.
For Pete's sake, Jules, we got work to do.
I'll drinkto that.
(SINGING BACK IN THE SADDLE
AGAIN)
DEXTER: You idiot.
Don't stick your bald head in my face again.
We'll finish our little discussion later.
Are you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
Ups-a-daisy. You should be in the booth. Why?
You're the director.
I know that.
It's not like I don't know what I do. I do know what I do.
It's just that when you have as much to do as I do do...
Don't tell my dad about this, okay? He'll have my head.
Then where would you put your hair?
I'm sorry?
I said,
I'll see you down there.
Okay, Wa|t's on his way.
Now all we need is a script.
What? No script?
Girls, girls, please. Back to the mikes. It's gonna be just fine.
We need some sort of a final scene here between the husband and the wife.
Yes. Now, think, think, think.
What ifthe wife smashes him over the head with a frying pan, then chops him in hundreds oftiny little pieces with her shiny, new carving knife?
I don't think so.
It's a family show.
Okay, well, then, what if she does it to the whole family?
ALL: No!
What's wrong with you?
You never like any of my ideas.
Hold it. Husband says,
"Darling, you can't leave.
"What would it take to make you stay?"
She says, "Try chloroform."
This isn't a comedy.
That wasn't ajoke.
The hell it wasn't. Okay, okay, okay, okay. How about he says,
''I can't go on without you.
I can't clean, I can't iron,
''I don't know my way around the kitchen."
And she says, "Buy a map.
Then we'll talk.''
Morgana, two. Writers, nothing. FATHER: She's good.
WOMAN: That works.
I know.
Okay, here you go, kid.
Take it away.
Go, go, go!
Run! Run!
Go, go, go!
I'm going. I'm going!
Fifteen seconds.
I have the scripts!
Mr. Katzenback.
Have you people no idea of discipline?
We have a script.
And we have a director.
Ofsorts.
Cue that slimeball announcer.
Cue Dexter.
And now time for Home is Where the Heart Aches.
Rotate the stage.
Oh, I hate that stage.
This rotating stage is the best idea I've ever had.
Cue the organ.
Tonight, we join Mildred and her mother in their tastefully decorated kitchen.
Not quite ready.
Billy.
Slow stop. No, slow!
That's Billy.
Abandoned by Jim, my husband of 20 years, and recently disturbed by the news that Ellen, my loving daughter, is marrying Jim's illegitimate stepson,
I find myself mired in a week-long depression.
Tell me, Mom.
What should I do?
Die, infidel.
Die like a dog, writhing in pain from the horror known as the curse of Nebuchadnezzar.
Well, that's not right.
Thanks, Mom. You always seem to know what's best.
That's good!
We didn't write that.
It's too creative.
You got that right.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Excuse me, I think someone's at the door.
Billy.
Is there a problem?
Damndest show I ever seen.
Artistic.
Oh, that must be your father. You take it.
What the hell is going on?
One is doing the soap, the other's doing Tom Adventure.
Toilet.
Sir?
Billy!
You bellowed?
Get this to the actors, and then get those scripts sorted out.
Well, Mom, it's getting close to lunchtime and...
Traitorous words, you American slime.
And your last, as it's time for me to finish you off with your own rifle.
MOM: Did you hear me?
Your own rifle.
My own rifle?
Yes, yes. Where is that rifle ofyours?
You're not going to shoot me, are you?
Well, perhaps I was hasty.
After all, shooting you would be wrong.
Whoa. That hurt, that hurt.
Mildred, is that you?
What's he doing now?
I'm sorry
I frightened you, dear.
I was kidnapped by a band ofEgyptian nomads and hypnotized into thinking I was a warrior of the Sahara, but the gunshot snapped me out ofit, and now I'm back.
Do you have any coffee made?
Why, yes, Mom. There's a fresh pot on the stove.
(WATER BUBBLING) Sounds perfect, even though there's...
MALE VOICE:
"Hardly time to say a prayer
"Before we move on to the air"
What?
I'm going down to check master control.
Cue the commercial.
Billy!
See if anyone's in Studio B.
Billy, bring me a tomato, quick!
RICK:
Billy, find my tuba player.
DEXTER: Blue Sky.
Fresh as a spring rain.
Cool as a summer breeze.
Blue Sky has got the smoke that goes down smooth.
I told Dexter not to smoke.
If you ask me, they ought to put warnings on those packages.
It's not Dexter. It's coming from somewhere else.
It's coming from right here.
Someone's idea of ajoke?
Studio 13.
I'm gonna go see what's going on.
Penny, I'm only gonna say this once...
Hey, Mr. H, you're looking chipper.
Penny in the fishbowl?
I gotta talk to her.
Yeah, but I wouldn't talk to her before you finish...
Gork: Son ofFire. Don't get your pants in a bunch.
Penny, I'm only gonna say this once...
Let's get that pack of butts off stage and get the microphones out, boys.
MAX: Ready light cue, as you will.
There is an evil that lurks behind you.
TOM: Is it your shadow, or is it the Mind Bender?
Are you sure this is the right floor?
There's nobody up here, Mrs. Henderson. It's all right, Dottie.
Fred Smith, an ordinary man not unlike you or me, walks home on a fog-shrouded night.
This is the night when he will reach deep inside himself and discover the Mind Bender.
What's that sound I hear?
What do you think you're doing? Looking for you.
Well, you scared the bejesus out of me. Really?
Sounded like a squeal of delight to me.
Someone is fooling with an open mike on 13.
(SHUSHING) Look, ljust wanted to saythat I... ok3Y-
All right. Bad timing.
Look, you think after the show we could get a cup ofjava or something?
Roger. Keep trying, it'll come back to you.
Dead man.
Where?
SHERWOOD:
Strange eating habits, indeed.
Well, Maynard, tell us, which part of this Buick did you eat first?
With a little deviled egg, the lug nuts make wonderful appetizers.
Lug nuts.
Well, gentlemen, when you see the rest of the firepower that we have marshaled for you this evening,
I'm gonna expect you to do your duty and run out and enlist in my war against the other three networks.
My girlfriend and I...
Girlfriend, hey.
We're thinking about eating a bus together.
Won't that be scrumptious!
We'll do our best to check in with you then.
Call the police.
DEXTER: And now, the girl with the va-va-va-voom voice,
Claudette Katzenback!
(SINGING A GUY
WHAT TAKES HIS TIME)
The Genera|'s son just committed suicide.
Tough break.
Hate to lose that weak-kneed, lily-livered son of a...
Famous general, right, sir?
You're wanted in the General's office right away.
Mr. Station Manager, sir, you're supposed to rush down to the General's office right away.
Though being my boss and all, I suppose you can just slowly saunter if you want to.
Carry on.
DEXTER: That was the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl herself,
Claudette Katzenback.
All right, ladies and gents.
At 7:15 this evening, young Walt Whalen Junior was found hanging in an empty studio.
The apparent cause of death, suicide.
My son didn't have enough courage to commit suicide.
It was murder!
Maybe suicide, maybe murder. Either way, I'm missing my dinner.
It was murder, and I brought you here to find the killer.
And I don't want you to leave until you've done that.
Do you understand me,
Lieutenant?
Get my people out of here as soon as possible.
I've got a network to run.
Now, which of you...
You sent for me?
Maybe. Who are you?
I'm Claudette Katzenback, the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl with the va-va-va-voom voice.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Lieutenant Cross, the Chicago cop with the sh-sh-sh-short temper.
I'm here investigating a Mr. Walt Whalen Junior's death.
Walt? Dead?
No. Why didn't anybody tell me?
Not that I actually knew the man. I didn't.
I mean, he was a director, wasn't he?
I'd like to play poker with you sometime.
(SINGING I'LL BE GLAD
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD)
Which one of you is Penny Henderson? PENNY: That's me.
What do you do around here?
Just about everything, sir.
Shut up and sit down.
Okay.
I'm the General's secretary, sir.
My condolences.
You found the dead guy?
Up on the 13th floor.
See anybody else up there?
We just found
Walt hanging there.
I infer by your use ofthe plural that there was somebody else up there with you?
Not with me.
When I got up there, I saw Roger coming down the hall.
Roger!
So, you must be Roger.
Must I?
I've got one question for you, young man.
Why were you up there?
Did you have business in that studio? What were you doing?
Isn't that three questions?
Nothing, nothing.
I was looking for Penny.
To discuss a script.
He's a writer.
A writer? I hate writers!
They drink too much, they beat their wives...
Lieutenant!
What?
No, no. Not, "What? I didn't hear you." I mean, what!
What the hell is going on around here?
Somebody else died in Radioland tonight.
Why weren't we notified?
It was a trumpet player, but the doctor said it was just a heart attack.
The coroner says different. Says your trumpet player was murdered!
Pickled with an arsenic-and-gin cocktail.
COGLEY: That was rat poison.
He showed me Ruffles‘ flask.
Flask?
Roger had it.
Deja vu.
This is all very explainable, okay?
I was running by when they were carrying Ruffles‘ body offthe stage.
And he happened to drop his flask on my script, and ljust... ljust picked it up.
I don't suppose you still have it? No, no, of course not.
Why would I still have it?
Right here in my pocket, wherein all the confusion,
I forgot that I put it.
Careful! It might have fingerprints on it.
Fingerprints?
Of course there are fingerprints.
My fingerprints. I'm holding it, you idiot. Give me that!
Well, well, well. Roger's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.
Placed at the scene of Wha|en's death, and now he has the poison that killed poor Ruffles.
Hey...
Oh, pipe down, Dexter.
Roger may be a lot ofthings, but he's not a murderer.
She's right.
I'm not even a lot ofthings.
CROSS: I said, shut up and sit down.
You seem to know him pretty well, for a secretary.
Well, I'm his wife, too.
Ex-wife. Soon-to-be ex-wife.
We're getting divorced.
How come?
I couldn't trust him.
He lies.
PENNY: Not big lies.
One big lie. But he never lied about killing anyone.
That I know of.
I'll remember you when I need a character witness.
Isn't that what's referred to in police jargon as a lead?
Oh, put a sock in it, Dexter.
I happen to know that you had a fist fight with Juniorjust before he was killed.
Guess that makes you what we refer to in police jargon as a suspect.
Now you're talking!
Shut up.
And sit down, I know.
CROSS: Stay put, Mr. Morris.
We'd like to ask our suspect a few questions.
Don't wander too far,
Shakespeare!
You're next.
Thanks a lot!
(WHISPERING) I'm a suspect. Okay, Roger, I'm sorry.
It's a little late for that now!
That lunkhead copper's gonna want me on a carpet in a couple of minutes.
I gotta clear myself, and fast.
DEXTER: And now, here they are, America's favorite hosts...
All right.
Well, well, well.
Looks like Ruffles caught your good side.
You're double-jointed, huh?
This is all the proof! need.
Give me those!
You know, I'd kill to have pictures like these.
Maybe your husband would, too.
DEXTER: And now, that rip-roaring, rococo Romeo of ridiculous, roguish rigmarole and rhapsodic, rapier-like repartee,
Won't happen again,
Dexter.
...Rick Rochester and his Rascals of Rhythm.
I'll ream those writers.
Thank you! Yes!
MALE VOICE: "You hadn't a clue of what to do
"When you caught your falling star"
Well, that's a good idea.
You got a better one?
Check for open mikes.
Oh, that's original.
What the hell is wrong with my stage?
This can't be happening.
Not to my baby!
Looks like your baby needs a good whack in the axle.
Don't you touch my stage!
Somebody better do something about your big idea stage,
‘cause the band's a-going ‘round again.
I've got it!
Is it contagious?
Just don't give it to us.
No, no, no. I've solved the murder. Jeepers, Roger.
No, listen to me, Penny.
I know...
HERMAN: I know more about that stage than anyone.
Wait a minute, Katzenback,
I wanna talk to you!
Oh, wait a minute, Mr. H, lthinkthe cops want you upstairs.
GangW3YI
There must be a loose connection underneath the stage.
I will fix it!
Just shut offthe power to the turntable while I'm down there.
And find me someone to fire!
What? Oh, God.
Hold it, Herman.
We have some talking to do.
ROGER: Tough guy, huh?
Yes, sir, General, I know.
We need to get it fixed.
We're doing everything we can.
Roger.
I'll call you back.
What is going on here?
Herman?
What do you think,
Herman, huh?
Blackmail a good motive for murder?
You're crazy, Henderson.
My wife was fooling around with everyone and his dog. Even I know that.
Ruffles showed you these photos, then you killed Walt Junior for messing around with your wife.
HERMAN: You see. Yeah.
Yeah. See?
It's sabotage. Yeah.
German engineering could never be ruined by American pipe.
There it goes again.
I gave no...
Herman!
Perry, Perry, kill the revolve! We've got people under there!
Henderson, wait. I'm caught!
I've got to go down there. Let me go, please, please.
Pull me!
I'm pulling!
Henderson!
Henderson!
For God's sake, Henderson!
Henderson!
It's Katzenback!
Move out!
Oh, God, it's Herman!
He's... He‘s...everywhere!
Roger. Where's Roger?
If you find his diamond, I know he'd want me to have it.
They missed me. lthink I'll talk to the cops now.
DEXTER: WBN...
What happened?
Katzenback is mashed potatoes.
Dead?
Very.
When is this going to stop?
I see this as a classical tragedy in three acts. Act One,
Claudette and young
Walt Whalen Junior were indulging in some illicit sexercise.
Exhibit A.
Ruffles Reedy had the photos.
He was blackmailing them, threatening to go to C|audette‘s husband, Katzenback.
So Walt Junior put an end to Ruffles Reedy. He shut him up permanently with poison. Exhibit B.
Unfortunately...
Unfortunately...
Excuse me.
Unfortunately, he killed him too late.
Ruffles had already blown his tune to Katzenback.
Am I going too fast foryou, Lieutenant?
Yeah, you wise guy...
Act Two.
In a fit of insane jealousy,
Katzenback kills Walt Junior, his wife's young lover, which brings us to Act Three, the final act. The denouement.
Where Claudette, distraught, avenges Walt Junior's death by killing her husband,
Herman Katzenback. Lights down, curtain, thunderous applause.
Not bad, Sherlock.
ROGER: Anytime, chief.
I'm proud to have brought Claudette Katzenback to justice.
Though in a way,
I almost feel sorry for her.
You know, such a bitter, conniving, twisted personality.
I'll murder you, you little punk.
Though you gotta love her way around a show tune.
Lieutenant, he hates me because of a sillyjoke.
You see, I made his wife believe we were having an affair.
And this is his revenge.
Well, it wasjust a little joke, stupid!
Well, nobody‘s laughing, sister.
You don't know how much
I'm gonna hate saying goodbye to all you swell show biz people.
Watch your fingers.
The book's slamming shut on this case.
I slammed my fingers in a car door once.
Ouch.
Cuff her.
No! You mean, you're actually arresting me?
This is an outrage.
Penny...
Roger... Soldier, that was clear thinking under fire.
Thank you, sir.
How much do I pay you, anyway?
No, no. No, that's not necessary, sir.
I mean, I only make $40 a week and... Sounds about right. Dismissed.
We've lost our director and our station manager.
A new leader's got to come forward and take command.
Well, the troops will follow you anywhere, sir.
I'm talking about you, Henderson. You're the director.
You're the new station manager.
I know, I know, they're big shoes to fill, but I think she has the feet for the job.
I've got to go coddle King and the affiliates.
I'm depending on you to keep this network running.
Yes, sir.
At ease, Private.
Director.
Get back to your typewriter.
We got a lot of work to do.
Miss Henderson,
Miss Henderson! Hey, Mr. H.
What is it? Oh, Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick, the actors still don't have their scripts. What?
Yeah, and they're up right after Ben Butter‘s talking pig.
Well, get to the writers‘ room and get the scripts. Quick, come on.
Come on, clear the way.
All right, all right.
Come on, come on.
Hey, take her downtown.
Wonderful.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick is up in five minutes.
I know. Deirdre, get this to the actors. Is that the whole thing?
That ought to hold them till Billy gets down with the other pages.
MAN: And stay out!
We haven't been paid in three weeks, and we're not gonna rewrite any more pages until we are!
Am I making myself clear?
Sorry, I might be little on edge.
Come on, guys, you can't do this.
There are a lot of people waiting on those pages.
Will you quit fooling around? We have work to do. Now, come on.
Go chew a bone.
He's with me. Come on.
Give me those notes.
Here's your script.
One page?
Sorry.
Sorry?
This is pitiful.
MALE VOICE: "Beginnings and endings are easy
"But your words are twisted and wheezy"
What are those things? There's been three or four ofthem tonight.
Only three ofthem. Right before each ofthe murders.
I rememberthem, Mr. H. I remember them all, word for word.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
Well, when it comes to radio,
I'm kind of a Mr. Memory.
You know, I even remember the first thing lever heard on radio.
It was Kay Kornwall's
Kollege of Musical Komedy.
Kid! Just give me the first one, will you? Oh, right.
“Dig and dig to find some dirt
“Dig too deep and you'll get hurt“
“Dig and dig to find some dirt“
That could be Ruffles, right?
He was blackmailing everybody.
Kind of a reach, Mr. H.
Then there was,
“Hardly time to say a prayer
Before we move on to the air“.
Air. Heir! Heir. That could actually be “heir“ as the H-E-I-R.
The Genera|‘s heir, right?
Walt Junior.
And now, here's another thrilling episode of
Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick.
I've gone through this once already. But it's not any...
MAX:
Get their butts out there.
JOHNNY ACE:
Who do they think we are?
Go! Go!
They only have the one page ofthe script I wrote for them.
Better one than none.
Just another day in the life of Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick.
Except today was not an ordinary day.
I'll say.
Good morning, Johnny.
So, what's the latest?
Well, looks like we're in mid-case without a parachute, toots.
What? That's it?
That...
Oh, this will be good.
What should we do now,
Johnny?
Oh, brilliant improvisation.
It's hard to say.
A situation like this can fool you. lmean, you step up to the plate expecting a high, hard one.
The actors are improvising? lmean, just when you think you know who the killer is, lmean, just who you think it was, wasn't.
Katzenback!
Katzenback!
C|audette‘s the falling star he caught having an affair.
Keep it coming.
“Beginnings and endings are easy
“But your... But your words are twisted and wheezy“
Words, words...
Twisted and wheezy.
That's smoking?
Coughing? The...
Dexter!
Dexter!
What's Dexter got to do with it?
One minute, you're walking on water, and before you know it, you're all wet.
Oh, this is so sad.
Pathetic.
JOHNNY ACE: Well, never mind.
Dexter and everybody who left here in a hearse used to work with my dad back at WOWA in Peoria.
Till the FCC scandal broke it up. ScandaL
Yeah, and their bathrooms was just as dirty.
Coming in!
Shake a leg and zip it up.
WOWA.
Peoria.
Jumpin‘ Jehoshaphat!
Dexter is next!
And, toots?
Yes, Johnny?
You look after the office until I'm back.
Now we're in trouble.
Cue Dexter.
We'll return with the exciting adventure conclusion of
Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick in just a moment.
Dexter!
Dexter!
It's locked!
Dexter.
I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about Sunrise Surprise Coffee.
Dexter! Open the door! Open the door!
That rich, aromatic, flavorful way to start the day.
Dexter! Open the door!
Mmm.
Just one sip and you'll see what I mean when lsay...
Get the stand, will you?
Get the stand!
Then, on three. One, two...
Three?
What are you doing?
What in the...
Open up the...
The door!
It's not supposed to be locked.
Hey!
Cut it out!
Come on, come on.
Phil, call Doc Burman.
Everyone get back to work.
So I guess we'll be needing a new announcer, huh?
Go to Tom McCa||um‘s dressing room, tell him he‘sjust been promoted to announcer.
Tom McCa||um?
Now. ok3Y-
Oh, my God.
“Your words are twisted and wheezy“
That's you, Dexter.
I want a cop stationed at every exit of the studio.
Any man, woman, dog, cat or duck tries to leave, pull them and chain them to a desk.
You seen Tom McCa||um?
No.
Hey-
Whoa.
What?
Not again.
Dexter's dead.
It's another murder.
MAN: I'm going home. WOMAN: But the police won't let you.
You! Front and center.
I got ajob for you.
Yes, sir, General Whalen.
We'll have the new announcer up and running before you can...
Stow it, grunt.
I can't have any scuttlebutt about our latest casualty.
If the affiliates get word, they'll be out of here quicker than Shinola through a goose.
Do whatever you have to do to keep them in that room.
Boy, I love radio, but I love a good pee even more.
Open up!
I gotta go to the bathroom! An empty bott|e‘s always good in a pinch.
(SHUSHING) May I have your attention, please?
Quiet!
I know things have been a little crazy around here tonight, and you're all shook up.
Since we can't leave, and we still got ajob to do, we might as well do it and do it right.
Look, all I'm saying is, we're a team.
And we gotta trust the police to do theirjob and get back to caring about ours.
It's not ourjob to care.
It's everyone‘s job to care.
It's everyone‘s job to care.
Look, Penny's right.
We do still have ajob to do.
And believe me, pretty soon they're gonna nail this schizo, this nutsy, mad-dog fruitcake.
Henderson!
Come with me.
Obviously, there's been a mistake.
MAN: Murderer!
WOMAN: Yeah.
You're gonna talk ifl have to wring it out ofyou!
No! Please,
I can't take any more.
Go on, kid.
Spill the beans.
Well, I told you, it wasn't me.
But all four ofthose victims had something in common.
Yeah. They're all dead.
Besides that. They all worked together a few years ago at radio station WOWA in Peoria. Won't fly, Lindbergh. This is Chicago.
Peoria‘s a lot smaller than Chicago.
Look, I heard about an FCC scandal there.
Maybe someone's trying to kill them all to keep it quiet.
Yeah, and maybe the Easter Bunny craps colored eggs!
Listen to me, scribe.
You led me down the garden path with that Claudette broad.
But you were the one with Ruffles‘ flask.
You were the one who was up there hanging around with Walt.
You were the one with Katzenback when he got crushed into kibble.
And you were the one who just happened to get there in time to see Dexter light up like a Roman candle!
How do you explain all that?
I'm having an off day?
What about those recordings, huh? That mysterious voice?
I got two words of advice for you, punk.
Get a lawyer!
Wait a minute.
What mysterious voice?
MALE VOICE: "Across the wave
"You gathered your host
"To see them line up from ghost to ghost"
That one! That one!
That's the killer.
He's broken into the broadcast before each ofthe murders.
Those riddles tell you who's gonna be next.
Big deal.
You could have written them yourself.
You said they were recordings.
All right. All right.
You got 30 seconds to tell me what it means.
Hey! Hey! Now take it easy. Take it easy, fellas.
Just going to a typewriter.
It helps me think.
Thanks for the tan.
You're the engineers.
Have you tried everything?
It's not here, Penny.
That voice is not coming through any of our mikes or any of our studios.
Oh, well, I got news for you. It's being broadcast over our airwaves.
Penny, what are you trying to say?
You think this is my fault or Tommy's?
No! I don't care whose fault it is. Good. Then understand that the real problem is not where the voice is coming from.
Right.
It's who might die next.
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
“Gathered your host
“from ghost to ghost“
“Ghost to ghost.“
That could actually be coast to coast.
That's the radio station.
Right?
And, “Gathered your host,“ it's...
General Whalen.
He's the host.
He's gonna be killed next.
We'll see.
TOM: And now, celebrating his 100th year in show business,
Milt Lackey.
Here we go, Bernie.
The crown jewel.
Thank you. Thank you.
Open up!
I gotta go to the bathroom! lget up in the morning, and I read the obituary column.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) My name isn't in it, I have breakfast.
The day I see my name in it,
I'll still have breakfast.
I'm not leaving on an empty stomach.
General Whalen, I...
Hey, hey, hey.
Excuse me, General,
I'd like you to let two of my men accompany you to your office.
There's a...
Strong probability...
There's a remote possibility that you could be the killer's next target.
Me? Bull twaddle.
I'm staying right here, on the front line.
You know, General, being the law and all,
I got the authority to shut this three-watt circus down.
Humor me.
Jenkins, Muldoon, go with the General.
The rest of you come with me.
We're gonna take Mr. Henderson here someplace quiet where we're gonna have another little talk.
Cuff him. You can't do that, Lieutenant.
Shut up.
Lieutenant!
General.
MILT LACKEY: In what other business can a man my age walk out on the stage, smoke a cigar, tell a few jokes, sing a few songs and use the same color lipstick that Dolores del Rio uses?
Everybody wants to know when I'm gonna retire.
I'll never retire.
You think his parents beat him when he laughed?
Oh, I'm even gonna take my music with me.
Tommy, was that a smile?
Yeah. Take a look at this.
Max, Max, Max.
What? What?
Come, look, he's laughing.
Oh, my goodness.
Holy mackerel!
He's laughing.
Bernie King is actually laughing.
All right, come on. No, no, no. Wait a minute, Lieutenant.
Bernie King never laughs at anything.
All right. Come on, kid.
We got a lot to talk about.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Something‘s wrong up there.
The General was supposed to be in that booth till you took him out.
Bernie King's gonna be killed by mistake.
Oh, gee, I hate interrupting a man who's enjoying his own murder so much.
Let's go!
(GROANS) Oh, my foot!
That's it. The only thing lgot that still works.
Now that's great radio.
Yes. He's laughing, General.
Laughing?
Hey! That way! That way!
Spread out.
He couldn't have gone far.
Move it! Move it!
I guess he had a lot of laughs stored up.
He really loves it, sir.
What's next? Bring me that list of programs.
PENNY: Now?
Yes, now.
Retire.
Who'd support my mother and father?
Mr. King!
It's locked!
Hey! Put up your hands.
He's dying in there. We gotta break the glass. Use your gun.
Dying?
Use your gun!
Right.
I meant shoot it!
I know that.
You...
Give me that.
Give me that.
Tell you what... Okay.
What are you...
MILT LACKEY:
Thank you very much.
I'm out of bullets.
Go get Cross, will you?
Quick, get out of here.
Mr. King.
Henderson.
Yes.
Those jokes stink!
ROGER: Mr. King.
Mr. King!
He's dead, Lieutenant.
It must be nitrous oxide.
Laughing 935-
Get a doctor, Mahoney. Wipe that smile from off your face.
This is murder.
(LAUGHING) Cuff him, boys.
Okay, Henderson, no more funny stuff.
It's the gas, Lieutenant.
The laughing caves in yourwindpipe.
It's a long, painful, ugly way to die.
Put a lid on it, Henderson.
Murder may be a big joke to you, but not to me and not to my men.
We'll probably get the chair.
ROGER: Deirdre.
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Where's Penny?
She's with the General.
Tell her I love her.
General, Roger Henderson just killed Bernie King.
That's ridiculous.
We caught him red-handed, miss.
He can't be dead.
He's our biggest sponsor.
Not that it wouldn't be a tragedy if he wasn't.
Henderson, let's march.
General, I reallythink you better stay up here.
GENERAL: I don't take orders from sergeants.
Men, I understand the gravity of the situation.
I will treat every step as if it could be my last.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my gosh.
No time to faint.
The first thing I want to know is... Lieutenant!
The Genera|‘s been murdered.
I knew it!
I mean,
I didn't really know it.
How could I? Really?
Look out?
What does that mean?
You scoundrel.
Take that. Take that.
Sic him, lads!
I have to go to the powder room. JACK: Great timbers.
Well, I wonder where he came from.
WOMAN: Where am I?
Don't worry, young lady, you're safe now.
Oh, thank you... ljust can't believe it.
One minute, he's standing right next to me. And the next minute, whoosh!
SERGEANT:
Hey, Lieutenant. Lieutenant.
Look at these scratches.
Something was tampering with the controls.
What's this?
Thank you, Jack. That was the bravest rescue I've ever seen.
I don't have time for fear, ma'am.
That's why they call me
Jack Granite, man's man.
This is a nightmare, Max.
I know we're all a little bit jumpy right now.
Could Roger have...
VVhy?
Well...
It doesn't make sense.
No.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Really?
Look, I have a new lead.
Well, so do we.
What?
Believe this belongs to you.
Found it at the bottom ofthe elevator shaft where the controls were tampered with.
No, I'm...
I must have dropped it somewhere, you know?
Really? Maybe you dropped this, too, huh?
Found it clutched in Walt Whalen Junior's hand.
Looks like he grabbed it from somebody just before he got hung.
No, now, hold it. I've seen that knife before and I...
Where the hell have I seen it?
Roger.
Penny!
No, no, it's all right.
It's all right. Go ahead.
Penny. What in the world is going on, Roger?
What? Tell me something. Tell me anything.
Look, I didn't do anything.
You gotta try harder.
I didn't do anything!
Penny, please,
I'm begging you.
You have to believe me.
Nobody else will.
I didn't kill anybody. But I'm very close to figuring out who did. Okay?
Who did it then?
Okay. Okay-
I'm not sure. But it involves an FCC scandal and a merger and radio station WOWA in Peoria.
Three strikes and you're out, Houdini.
We're gonna be leaving now,
Mrs. Henderson.
You can tell your crew it's finally over.
But...
You're a writer, Henderson.
Time for you to write something for me.
What?
A confession.
I killed them.
Yes. Yes. I killed them all.
Why'd you do it, kid?
Why? You wanna know why?
Because I hate doing rewrites!
Watch out!
All right.
Stand back, men.
Give him room.
Rewrites! Polishes! Gags! I mean, they always want more gags.
And then they read them wrong, anyway!
They all laughed at me.
I'm just the writer.
They thought they were better than me, but they weren't!
They're just cockroaches!
And what do you do with cockroaches?
You squash them, squash them, squash them, squash them, squash them!
And you think that's all?
No, no, no.
I've killed dozens.
I've got names, dates, all the evidence you could possibly want.
CROSS: Where?
Upstairs in my desk.
All right.
All right, now.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Calm down. Calm down.
We're gonna go upstairs, we're gonna have a nice little talk.
Penny, are you all right?
Everything‘s falling apart, Max.
People dying-
Roger being arrested for murder. ljust can't believe it.
I mean, the second I met him, it was like he'd been there my whole life.
Right from the start.
It's like, I don't know...
An old sweater or something.
You know?
Warm and comfortable and familiar.
We met for lunch, and we were best friends before they could take our order.
It was like we had so much in common.
We laughed at the same things.
We thought about the same things.
I don't know what to think.
I thought I knew him.
I couldn't have been that wrong about him. Could I?
You want a straight answer?
No. Yes.
Penny, now, you know that Roger is not a maniac killer.
Roger is not organized enough to order dinner, let alone plan six murders.
And as for Claudette, oh, come on. I saw them...
No, what you saw was a crazy woman throwing herself at an innocent bystander.
Number one, Roger loves you.
Number two, Claudette has tried to jump on every man in this building at one time or another.
Believe me.
Smart of you, cooperating with the police.
It'll look good in court.
Come on, son. Be a man.
Okay.
That's it.
Paychecks!
Paychecks!
Paychecks, everybody!
CROSS: Stand back!
Don't interfere!
This man just confessed to murder!
WOMAN: Where's my overtime?
You'll never take me alive, coppers. Never!
Don't jump or I'll shoot!
Don't look.
Kid's lost it.
Go downstairs.
Find what's left of him.
JASPER: Yes, sir. Let's go.
What a bunch of nimrods.
Let's find him.
Where the hell is he?
SERGEANT: I don't see him.
Oh, there he is! Up there!
Stop or we'll shoot!
He's got a gun.
Agun?
Now we'll never get our money.
Hey!
SERGEANT: Give up, kid!
Hold your fire.
I'm gonna get the Lieutenant.
Jump, Roger, jump!
Atta baby, go!
Hey, stay where you are!
Max, I'm getting some voltage fluctuation here.
Oh, God.
This guy's good.
I can't believe I did that.
Hey, did you hear?
Mr. H escaped!
Search the room, lads.
Over here. Come on.
He's not here, sir.
Call headquarters and get more men up here.
We're gonna have to search every square inch ofthis building.
He's got a gun, sir.
Shoot to kill.
So you have to realize that there's a lot of work that really goes into a radio station...
Excuse me, young man.
Excuse me.
Yes, killer penguin,
Studio 10.
Mrs. Henderson dropped these papers. They may be important.
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll get them to her for you.
See, you gotta understand they let me in the booth anytime I want.
Hello.
Where you can pop, pop, pop your troubles away.
Slide in, relax.
And remember, even a busy modern gal needs to be squeaky clean for her man.
Penny? Penny-
Oh, cue the band. Cue Anna.
Cue band. Anna, go.
Miss Henderson, some penguin told me you dropped this.
BILLY: You know, I heard that they have orders to shoot Mr. H on sight.
That's crazy.
Can you live without me for a few minutes, Max?
Sure. Penny, be careful.
Remember, there's a killer loose out there.
Billy.
Don't scream. Don't scream.
Don't scream. It's me.
Roger?
Take my head off.
What in the sam hill...
Are you completely out of your mind?
Okay, okay, so I'm suspected of six grisly murders.
There's no reason not to be civil.
Lieutenant Cross has his men everywhere. They're looking for you.
We shouldn't even be up here. I know. I know, Penny.
I had to talk to you before, you know, something happened.
Are you cold?
I brought your scarf.
No, no, no.
You know, penguins, we're used to it. lthink... lthink...
No, you go first.
You go first.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We're talking at the same time.
Married people do that.
Penny. Penny.
You remember our first time up here? Yes.
Remember when we sneaked up here, we brought that champagne?
We stared up at that tower, and we figured out how we could talk to the whole world through radio, you know.
You know, take the people anywhere we wanted.
Yeah.
I don't know if you even believe I'm innocent.
But I love you.
I do.
I better go.
Your head.
Don't lose your head.
Oh.
Roger, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna break into the file room. What?
No, no, no. Penny, come on. Listen to me.
All the victims were involved in something over at WOWA.
I'm gonna get to the bottom ofthis bucket of clams.
Roger,
I'll get you the key to the file room.
No.
Why not?
No. Penny, no. This is murder, and I don't want you involved, you know, when I do get caught.
Okay, penguin, hands up!
Which is right now.
Don't shoot!
He's got a gun!
What are you talking about?
I don't have a gun. Yes, you do. I'm his hostage.
No. Oh, my hostage!
Of course you are.
Now, stay back!
Stay back, I tell you, or we'll both go over.
No!
Now, |et‘sjust put that gun down. Put it down!
I'm putting it down.
I'm putting it down.
Put your hands up. Put your hands up. Yeah.
And throw that gun over here.
Come on, throw it over here!
Stay back!
Stay back, cop, or I'll let her have it.
I'll let her have it.
I'll hurt her.
Okay, okay.
So, now I'm involved. See?
Fiftieth floor, maintenance closet, 10 minutes.
We don't have to rewrite this script.
King's dead!
Is that okay with you, Jules?
He seems to be okay with it.
I want you to start up on the roof and work your way down floor by floor.
He's wearing a penguin suit. Well, get going.
A penguin shouldn't be hard to spot.
Right, sir.
PENNY: Billy Budget, report to the control booth immediately.
Billy, report to the control booth.
Wait a minute, that's me.
Now!
You called, Miss Henderson?
Don't move!
Don't shoot!
Please, he's one of us.
Please.
Billy...
TOM: That concludes tonight's presentation ofSentimenta| Whispers.
I'd love to know whose idea this was. I could kill him.
Get this to the top writer.
Jules? He's out cold.
Our best writer.
But that's Mr...
Oh! Yeah, sure. You got it.
Keep up the good work, fellas.
You know, I was thinking about... Now!
Mr. H! Mr. H!
Hey, Mr. H! Wait a minute!
Billy!
Get back here!
Billy?
Where the hell is he?
Conchita.
You know,
I was looking for a penguin,
(GROANS) but I guess I got a couple of minutes.
It's me, you chowder-head.
What are you doing here?
Geez Louise,
Mr. H! It's you!
You sure got some great melons.
Sorry, just trying to lighten a serious situation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where's Penny?
The cops are on her like red on an apple.
She sent me to give you this.
She's a pip-
Nice work, kid.
Keep your nose clean.
Don't tell anyone you've seen me. Now beat it.
Well, golly, Mr. H?
Can't I stay with you?
No.
Help you on your quest to right this terrible wrong? I mean, every hero needs a little sidekick.
No, no. I'm no hero.
Well, sure you are.
No, no, I'm not.
Sure you are.
Knock it off!
Sorry. Come on, the way you've been fighting back when the chips are down, for your life, your best gal.
To a young person like myself, desperately in need of a role model, you're an inspiration.
Maybe you're right. Let's go.
This is great. The spotlight ofjustice has fallen on me.
And together, we will thwart the dastardly minions of crime.
Oh, can it, will you, kid? Nobody talks like that in real life.
Got you, boss. Let's cut the ham out ofthe club sandwich.
What's the skinny, compadre?
Come here.
What are you doing?
Tonight on Ungawa, the Jungle Boy, can Ungawa save
Dr. Ashton-Reeves, his trusted
English benefactor, when they are outnumbered by a hair-raising horde of horrible headhunters?
REEVES: lsay, old chap.
Appears to be a bit of a sticky wicket ahead.
Easy for you to say, eh?
What?
So, this is the tomb ofAnarkali.
WOMAN: It's too dark in here.
I can't see a thing.
MAN 1: lknow it's in here.
It has no shape, no body.
MAN 2: It wants to do to us, what it did to Dr. Anton when he opened the tomb.
It's here! It's ripping the skin off my body!
Help me, Reginald, please!
Hold this.
MAN 2: Please!
Jeepers, Mr. H, you sure we're doing the right thing here?
Oh, take it easy, kid. Look, how long have we known each other anyway?
Six days. Exactly. There's a bond there.
Wait a minute.
“Misce||aneous.“
Found it!
WOWA list of employees.
FCC scandal.
Where's the light switch?
I'll get it.
What's in here?
That's the file room.
It's locked.
It was the killer.
I saw him. He was...
Horrible!
He was a tall guy and short, too.
And he was wearing this really nice suit.
Though it was kind of shabby.
And he had blackish, brownish, reddish, blondish, kind of, whitish hair.
And he definitely went downstairs, or maybe it was up.
Busy, bUSY-
(SINGING DON'T LET
YOUR LOVE GO WRONG)
Uh-huh.
All right. Perfect!
I don't know what happened to Billy.
Ten minutes to the last show, we don't have a script.
And this differs from the other six times this has happened tonight in what way, exactly?
The writers have left the building. Good answer.
I don't get it.
It's gotta be somebody who's still alive.
Wait a minute.
He's the one! Ssh.
That's where
I saw that knife.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I mean, like, why him?
How am I gonna tell anybody without getting filled full of lead?
TOM: Gork: Son of Fire!
Yeah, I'll get to it.
I'll get to it.
That script‘s not finished yet.
(MAN CHATTERING
OVER MICROPHONE)
Look, he almost killed someone else up on the roof.
I don't give a rat's behind where you pull them from!
I want at least two more squads up here.
With tear gas, riot guns and dogs!
Roger hates dogs.
All right, little lady,
I got one question for you.
What exactly were you doing up on that roof in the first place?
Doing? Me?
I was just getting a little fresh air.
Hey, do you hear something?
Yeah.
He's on a ledge outside Rehearsal Room 3.
Let's go. I don't want him falling again unless I push him.
Attention, all personnel.
Attention. The police have located the killer.
I repeat, they've located the killer.
What does she think she's doing?
They've cordoned off
Rehearsal Room number 3.
Thanks, kiddo.
We can all relax now and get back to work.
ALL: All right!
TOM: In a moment,
Gork: Son of Fire, after this.
Control booth.
Billy, it's for you.
Me? A phone call for me, here?
Well, it must be pretty important.
Hello, Billy Budget here.
MAN: Do you want to help Roger Henderson?
Sure. Sure I do.
Then make contact with the Latin bongo player in the eighth floor broom closet.
Gotcha. I'm on it.
Well, who was it?
It was, The Tribune.
They want to sell me a subscription.
I'm gonna think about it.
Mr. H! Good disguise.
Look, you gotta give these pages to Penny, pronto.
It's the first part of the Gork script.
Tell her I'll finish the rest as soon as I can.
Now go.
What atrouper, Mr. H.
Wanted for murder, forced to wear a series of humiliating disguises, and you still find time to do yourjob.
I'm a memory.
...invites you to go back in time a million years, to the thrilling adventures of
Gork.’ Son ofFire. Gork.’ Son ofFire has arrived!
Where‘d you get this?
A certain unnamed writer who said the rest is on the way. Is he okay?
Well...
Go get this to the actors.
We're on the air.
Billy!
Slow down.
Five bucks says he makes it in 10 seconds. You got it.
Come on, Billy, come on.
Who's got my script, huh?
Who's got my script?
Out ofthe way!
Out ofthe way!
MAN: What are we going to do?
This is crazy.
I can't do this.
Lines!
Yeah!
Lost again.
Gork.’ Son of Fire!
Fighting the terrifying
20-ton tyrannosaurus.
(IMITATING TYRANNOSAURUS GROWLING) One name stands out above them all.
Lightning strikes as Gork proudly drags home a pterodactyl after his daily hunt.
Oh, what's this?
Odd metallic object in cave.
Not rock. Cold, shiny.
It have place to sit.
Gork sit.
It's a time machine, and Gork has accidentally activated it.
The caveman is transported through centuries, hurtling through eons of time.
Until he at last finds himself standing in his mastodon robes and dinosaur headdress in the middle ofa large metropolitan radio station.
What the...
Radio station?
I don't know what's going on.
What the hell was that little announcement about, Mrs. Henderson?
Listen!
Six brutal murders have been committed in the station.
Judging by the offbeat way...
Grok?
Gork.
Gork dresses, I...
It's not making much sense.
Should I cue in a commercial?
Oh, no. Let it play, Max.
I think he's trying to tell us something. So am I.
You've just made yourself an accomplice, Mrs. Henderson.
ACTOR 1: He sure smells like a dead animal.
ACTOR 2: The way! figure, anyone who dresses like that is either a nut or a killer.
GORK: Gork no kill.
Gork peace-loving caveman.
Must unmask real killer.
Clear self. Find way back to prehistoric wife. Convince her to stay married.
Wild guess, those are Roger's pages?
Maybe Lieutenant Cross evolved enough to listen to truth.
That's me.
They're talking about me.
Gork know about crime,
Lieutenant.
Gork grow up in rough neighborhood.
Fifty million people are hearing my name, huh?
I hate cavemen almost as much as I hate radio writers and missing my dinner.
Gork not sure he have solution right on tip of fingers or tip of tongue or on top ofhead.
POLICEMAN: Hey, you!
Maybe Lieutenant have a few questions for Gork.
Questions? No,
I don't have any questions.
Take it easy. This is your baby, Neanderthal.
Either you know who the killer is or you don't.
It's not like the answers are suddenly gonna drop out of the sky.
That's him!
Watson, I want more men backstage.
A very cluttered time machine.
I got it, I got it.
I got it, I got it.
Gork see photograph of six victims.
Gork find link between six at radio station in Peoria.
No, no, no.
Get back! Get back!
Might say, missing link.
Don't let me die!
It's him!
The killer!
Let's get out of here.
Get me that writer.
Get me that writer.
You can't stop now.
We're still on the air.
Billy! Get them back on.
Max, tell me that wasn't Roger.
Okay, that wasn't Roger.
Come on, get back there.
I'll figure something out.
So, this all started with Ruffles, who got poisoned with his own hooch.
Who's Ruffles?
Can't you follow anything?
Next come Walt Junior, man who wear animal pelt on head.
Then useless station manager,
Mr. Katzenback.
At this point, it seemed like a love triangle.
But then Dexter, the announcer, was fried by his microphone.
That was a cruel one.
There he is!
Finally, laughing gas meant for both General Whalen and Bernie King.
What a way to go.
So, the elevator was a last-minute change ofplan.
Victims all worked together before along with one more person, the killer.
Don't make me do it!
Okay, I tell you who killer is now.
Only one person had know-how to put mystery recordings on air and pearl-handle pocketknife he always carry.
Penny... He must be going somewhere with this. lpoint to him with club.
The killer is our sound engineer,
Max Applewhite.
I always like
Roger's writing.
He takes chances.
You see? You see?
It wasn't me.
It was Max!
Of course it's him. It was Max Applewhite, clear as a bell.
Max?
Wait a minute. Back!
Back to the control booth!
Who's Max Applewhite?
Stop it, Max, please.
No! Stop! No!
No, stop it!
Max!
Get out! No.
TOMMY: It's Max! He's gone crazy. Get out of the way.
That's right, it was me, Max Applewhite.
I killed them all. I wanted to destroy the network.
Destroy the network?
Max, but why?
Destroy the network?
But why, Max?
ACTOR: Because those people destroyed me. Because they destroyed me.
How?
WOMAN: How?
MAX: They were all stockholders in WOWA
15 years ago, and they all lied to me!
I could have had the patent.
I could have had the patent, but I needed their money to prove that my ideas worked.
And I trusted...
God, I could just kill them!
Well, I did kill them.
But I never meant to frame Roger.
It's just that he made it so damn easy! lgot him!
SERGEANT: Let me in there.
Shut up!
You see, I was an inventor.
MAX: lbelieve I came up with the greatest single invention of the 20th century.
What invention?
But when those people in Peoria saw that I could really do it, they became afraid.
And they took all my designs, and they locked them in a safe, and they told me that I couldn't work on them anymore, because they owned them!
Do you believe that?
Well, tell me, do they own me?
Do they own this audience?
Do they own Chicago?
The world?
I gotta start using the stairs.
Well, do they own this?
Or this?
What are you doing?
MAX: Or this?
Scripts?
PEN NY: Please, Max!
Time to go!
Where are we going?
It's a surprise!
I'm a professional.
I'm not supposed to ad lib.
ACTOR 1: Go with the flow.
There's nobody here.
Is there any other way out of here? No.
Yes. Yes, the wiring chute.
There's a ladder up to the roof.
Both you follow them.
We'll meet you up on the roof.
Well, we're still on the air.
But they're out of script pages.
Get me the air corps.
That's our Billy!
How goes it?
Name, Little Spark.
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Gork's sidekick from cave down road.
Well...
Gork have hands full with modern problems.
So I finish story, how he solve murder and he get back to easier time of volcanoes, earthquakes, warring tribes and ferocious, man-eating dinosaurs!
You all right?
CROSS: You two guys, go upstairs! Right, sir.
Where's Penny?
That Applewhite character got her on top ofthe roof.
The roof?
What are you talking...
Move!
Okay.
Gork make ultimate sacrifice.
And send for help on prehistoric tom-tom.
Gork not so sure
Gork like idea.
Hang in there, Gork.
Go on! Move!
Okay!
What is all this, Max?
This is my little sanctuary.
It's my lab where I've been creating the future.
Come on, where'd he go? Penny!
Which way...
Penny!
Where is he?
What's that?
Television.
I created it over 25 years ago.
Oh, I know everybody‘s working on it now, but my design is still the best.
They wanted to destroy it, so I hid it.
They'll never find us in here.
Roger!
Penny!
Don't, don't, don't, Max!
Don't do it.
You're not going anywhere,
Applewhite.
You just told 50 million people that you're the killer.
Well, you won't get me.
Back out!
Come on, Max.
I'll kill her!
Well, take me, Max.
Take me instead.
Wait, listen to me.
We both love Penny.
We don't wanna see her get hurt.
And you probably don't even like me, right?
So it'll be easier for you to kill me.
What am I saying?
What are you saying?
I don't know. Come on, Max.
No, Max. It's okay. Come on.
Thanks. This will be easier.
Always glad to help.
Climb.
No. No! ok3Y-
Max, Roger's afraid of heights.
MAX: I'll remember that.
Well?
I sent for reinforcements.
There's nobody left.
Shut up.
MAX: Go!
ROGER: Okay, okay.
You know, Max, I'm not so sure this is the best way out of here, but where are we going?
To heaven, Roger.
We're going to heaven.
It's quite a climb.
Yes, it is.
Let's go.
You know, Max, it's kind of brisk up here. Why don't we just go back?
I can't go back!
Why not?
Because I've seen the future.
What are you talking about?
Television.
Come on, Max.
Up! okall. okay_
Up. up. UP!
O kay, 0 Kall-
Max, what is that?
Run for it, kid!
What? What do you mean,
“Run for it“?
He's gonna kill my husband!
Max. Max!
He's crazy!
Max, no!
Radio is over!
Thank you again, Major.
We couldn't have done it without you.
Okay, goodbye.
Are you okay?
Yeah. And you?
Yeah.
I can't believe he killed people over this.
Radio was his life. How could he think it was over?
He was just wrong.
He was wrong, that's how.
I mean, radio will never die.
It would be like killing the imagination.
Oh, my gosh.
We're still on the air.
Poor Tommy.
Let's go and scrape what's left of that psycho-killer from offthe pavement.
Hey! I'm talking to you guys.
Billy!
Five more minutes.
We're short. What do we do?
I don't know.
Have them do the commercial again.
What are you doing?
Well...
Mrs. Henderson. Great lineup of shows. Oh, really? Thank you.
I think I speak for all the affiliates when I say we're all pleased as punch to be on board.
Thank you. Well, I'm sorry, but I have to get back to the booth.
Keep up the good work!
Are you okay?
DEIRDRE: We did it.
Billy saved the show.
Great. Oh, cue Tom.
Oh, cue Tom.
Cue Tom.
Quite a day.
Yeah.
Yeah, but just remember, today is the first day ofthe next part of your life you haven't lived yet.
Roger...
It's a slogan I wrote.
I know, I know, it needs a little work, but...
From all of us here at WBN, good night to everyone in Radioland!
Can we just go home?
Do you mean it?
You really are the only guy for me.
I know.
‘‘I know‘‘?
What? What did I do now? Oh, nothing. Forget about it.
ROGER OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
What? What gives with you?
I was 1,000 feet up in the air with a madman, risking my life for you, and you say forget it.
PENNY: Oh, well, nobody asked you to. I would have gone, but, oh, no,
Mr. Marvel has to go.
I did it because I love you!
You love me? Well, what about how much I love you?
Oh, oh. So what you're saying is that you love me more than I love you?
Oh, you're impossible!
Oh, you're impossible!
ANNOUNCER: And that's it from WBN in Chicago.
If it wasn't clear before it's certainly clear now.
There'll never be anything quite like radio!
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention?
This has been our best year ever thanks to Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.
A-And I think we should give a special thanks to the people...
responsible for our record-breaking sales,
our Midwest marketing and distribution team,
- Scott Calvin and Susan Perry!
- Yeah!
Let's hear it for 'em!
Come on!
Susan, darling, come on up here.
Aren't they adorable?
Say a few words.
Thank you very much.
This was really a team effort,
and I would just want to thank every one of you individually--
But we don't have time for that, do we?
In all seriousness, um, here at B&R Toys,
we're not just about makin' a profit in quality toys.
We're also about families.
But our families aren't here with us right now.
Which is probably why Johnson's secretary is sittin'in his lap.
You guys have a great party, have a great year.
Drive safe.
Thanks very much.
Aren't they wonderful?
Laura, I was hopin' to catch you before you'd left your house.
I ran real late today. You wouldn't believe the traffic out here.
Yeah, same to you!
And that's not very ladylike!
Anyway, I'll try to get to my house as soon as I can.
Oh, there's the problem right there.
Three car pile-up.
I'm really gonna be late.
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to sing throw cares away
Christmas is here bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
Ding dong and dong, balance in song
Ring joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer from everywhere filling the air
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound go hand in hand calling in the town
Gaily they ring while people sing songs of good cheer, Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas
On we will sing, dawn with a hymn
Angel will come to every home
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to sing throw cares away
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells one seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
Go hand in hand
Calling in the town
Gaily they ring while people sing songs of good cheer, Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas
On we will sing, dawn with a hymn
Angel will come to every home
On we will sing, dawn with a hymn
Angel will come to every home
Ding dong ding
Dong
All right. Let's go.
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Neal.
- Oh, sorry I'm late. Hi.
- Hi.
- Did you want to come in for a minute?
- Neal's waiting in the car, so--
- Why doesn't he come in?
- 'Cause, Daddy, he says you'll just end up saying something snotty.
Not necessarily. Could be rude or sarcastic. Whatever it takes.
- See? I gotta go. Here.
- Oh, come on. Come on.
Christmas Eve.
Just for a minute.
Watch those steps.
They're real slippery.
- Ooh!
- Told ya.
- So--
- Well--
- You goin' to your mom's for dinner?
- Actually, we're gonna be with Neal's family.
Ah, Christmas at the pound.
There aren't that many presents over there.
Well, that's because
Santa isn't here yet.
Neal doesn't believe in Santa.
Well, Neal's head comes to a point.
-He's smart. He's a doctor.
-He's not a doctor. He's a psychiatrist.
Take your coat off.
You're stickin' around, aren't ya?
I'll be right there.
Just a sec.
- I just want to--
- Did that jerk tell Charlie there was no Santa Claus?
What? No. Oh, Charlie came home from school the other day in tears, because some big kid told him there was no such thing as Santa.
And, you know Neal.
Well, he sat him down and--
He told him that there was a Santa Claus.
Well, all he said was that
Santa was more like a feeling.
You know, more like a state of mind than a person.
Kind of like Neal.
And who gave you permission to tell Charlie there's no Santa Claus?
I think if we're gonna destroy our son's illusions, I should be a part of it.
- Yeah, but you're never around, are you, Scott?
- Oh, oh, please.
Listen, all we are trying to do is give Charlie a firm grasp on reality.
That's a good idea. You don't want kids runnin' around usin' their imaginations.
Oh, yeah. This from the guy responsible for the Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.
-Leave her out of this.
-Don't you burp me, don't you change me
- I'm the dolly--
- Why do you guys always have to fight?
I, uh, swear we're not fighting.
It's your mom's singing.
It sounds a lot like fighting, doesn't it? Cats even.
The trouble is, Neal and your mom, they don't believe in Santa because they were real naughty.
Which is why they'll probably get lumps of coal in their stockings.
I don't know. It seems kind of babyish to believe in that kind of stuff.
What are you talkin' about? I believe in Santa Claus. I'm not a baby.
- Well--
- Maybe it's time you left.
We don't want to keep
Dr Pinhead waiting.
Come here.
Do I gotta stay?
Listen, you and your daddy are gonna have a great Christmas, okay?
- Will you pick me up tomorrow?
- Of course.
- Early?
- Yes.
We're talking sunup?
You're here?
You'll be fine. Ah, merry
Christmas, Charlie. I love you.
I love you too, Mom.
- You be a good boy, okay?
- Bye, Mom.
Four hours?
I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas
- Your Christmas will be perfect--
-Just like the ones I used to know
... with its own built-in turkey timer.
Where those treetops glisten
-And now, we return to the most cherished of Christmas stories,
-And children listen
- Miracle On 34th Street, starring Natalie Wood and--
- To hear sleigh bells in the snow--
That is exactly why you want a high-quality fire extinguisher right in the kitchen.
Those flames were really big, Dad.
- Yeah, turkey's funny that way.
- Dad!
'Ey!
It's done.
You like osso buco, Charlie?
They're closed.
You know, Neal's a real good cook.
Yeah, and you should see him walk on water.
- You don't like him very much, do ya, Dad?
- Charlie, yeah--
I was joking, okay? I'm sorry.
I was just kiddin' around.
I like him a lo-- Yeah, sure,
I like him. You know, there--
There's just something about him that makes me wanna--
Lash out irrationally?
- Where did you hear that?
- From Neal.
I learn a lot from him.
He listens to me.
Yeah. Then he charges ya for it.
I'm dreaming
- Of a white Christmas
- All right. Denny's.
-Just like the ones I used to know
- It's always open.
- I don't wanna eat here.
- What are you talkin' about?
Everybody likes Denny's.
- Where those treetops
- It's an American institution.
- Glisten
- Are you with Hatsutashi?
- No!
- Dad burnt the turkey.
- Oh, yeah. This way. Come on.
- Right over there.
- Thank you.
- Here we go.
- Burn the turkey?
- Coffee?
- No, thank you,Judy.
What do you say we start out with cold glasses... of delicious seasonal favourite eggnog?
- I don't like eggnog.
- We're out.
- Coffee. Decaf.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll have chocolate milk, please.
- We're out.
- Plain milk's fine.
- Okay.
- At least we know they got hot apple pie.
- We did.
Mm-hmm!
This is nice.
''And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap...
- I'm dreaming
- ''had just settled down for a long winter's nap.
- Of a white
- ''When out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter,
- Christmas
- ''I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
''Away to the window
I flew like a flash.
''With a miniature sleigh and St.
Nich-- and Prancer and Dancer--
...and to all a good night.''
- What's that?
- What's what?
''A Rose Suchak ladder''?
It's not a ladder.
I said, ''arose such a clatter.''
It means, eh,
''came a big noise.''
What?
Charlie, ''arose'' is a word that means ''it came,'' and ''clatter'' is a big noise.
Now, please, go to sleep.
Shut your eyes.
How do reindeer fly?
They don't have any wings.
- Fairy dust?
- That's from Peter Pan, Dad.
- Horns.
- Antlers.
Whatever.
Their, uh, antlers give them--
You know, ther-- ther-- there's a slipstream effect-- The air go--
T-They move fa--
They're weightless.
- But if Santa's so fat, how did he get down the chimneys?
- He sucks it in like Grandpa.
But what about people who don't have fireplaces?
How does he get into their house?
Charlie, sometimes believing in something means you-- means you just believe in it.
Santa uses reindeer to fly because that's how he has to get around.
But you do believe in Santa, right, Dad?
Of course I believe in Santa.
Now, please, go to sleep.
- Dad?
- What is it, Charlie?
Maybe you better leave some cookies and milk out, just in case, okay?
Great. I'll just go preheat the oven.
And don't forget the fire extinguisher.
Good night, Charlie.
Ho!
Now, settle down there.
Dad! Dad!
- W-What?
- I heard a clatter.
- What, Charlie?
- There! A clatter!
- Charlie, what are you talkin' about?
- You know, ''it came a big noise.''
It's coming from outside.
Charlie, it's just the wind or somethin'.
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.
- Somebody's on the roof.
- Maybe it's Santa.
Not now, Charlie.
I want you to sit here, and I want you to stay right there.
- Charlie, do you know how to call 91 1 ?
- Sure. 91 1 .
Yeah. Great. Stay there.
- Hey, you!
- What's that--
Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, buddy.
All right, you should just stay still. Perfect.
- You got him!
- Charlie, stay where you are.
Charlie, would you listen to me?
Stay up there!
It is Santa!
You killed him.
Did not.
And he's not Santa.
Well, he was.
He's got some I.D. on him, I bet.
Fella, if you can hear me, I'm just lookin' for your identification.
Once I figure out who ya are, I'll--
I'll give you a lift back to the mall.
''If something should happen to me, put on my suit.
The reindeer will know what to do.''
Yeah, right.
Whoa.
- Dad!
- Hey.
He disappeared.
- Whoa!
- He's naked somewhere.
- You gonna put on the suit like the card said? Are you?
- No. No.
- Come on, Dad. I wanna go too.
- Stop it, Charlie.
We're not goin' anywhere.
- You never do what I wanna do!
- Would you please be quiet for a minute so I can figure this out?
Reindeer up on the roof.
Santa suit layin' on the ground.
Guy fell. Not my fault.
Reindeer on the roof.
That is hard to explain.
It's the ladder.
Where the hell'd this come from?
Look here, Dad.
''The Rose Suchak Ladder Company.''
- Huh?
- ''Out by the roof there's a Rose Suchak ladder.''
-Just like the poem.
-Just like the poem?
Charlie, come on down from there.
Charlie, get down from there!
Dad! You gotta see this!
- Don't touch anything!
- It's great!
I'm just gonna call the police.
I'll carry this stuff up there.
Let them deal with it, okay?
Whoa! This guy was huge.
Dad, isn't this neat?
Charlie. Charlie!
Stay away from those things.
They're reindeer.
You don't know where they've been.
They all look like they've got key lime disease.
Easy, Rudolph.
Excuse me, Comet.
Dad! Check out Santa's sleigh.
There's no such thing as Santa's sleigh.
- Sure there is. You said you believed in Santa, right?
- I did? I do.
What about the reindeer?
These are Santa's reindeer, aren't they?
I hope not.
These are, uh, a gift.
Probably from the cable company.
We're getting the Disney Channel now.
Merry Christmas.
- Now, hop out of there, please.
- I don't wanna go.
Listen, Charlie.
I'm not kidding. Let's go!
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah! Let's go! Whoa!
Charlie! Hold on, Charlie!
Whoa!
Giddyap, Comet!
Whoa, let's go!
Dad! Climb up here!
There we go!
So, uh, if we go straight on this road, and we hit I-94--
Well, we made good time.
Now what do we do?
- Get the bag of toys.
- And do what?
- Go down the chimney.
- Down the chimney?
You want me to take the toys down the chimney... into a strange house in my underwear?
No. You gotta put the suit on first.
You know what we're gonna do is we're gonna get outta here, because this whole thing is stupid.
How come everything
I wanna do is stupid?
I didn't say that.
Freezing my nubs off out here, and you want me to get into a Santa costume.
This is great.
A Santa costume.
Oh, this thing.
You never know where it's been.
A thousand malls.
Well, I hope you're happy, Comet.
Hope you're happy. But most of all,
I hope the guy that lives here is a tailor!
Nice coat.
Well, how do I look? Nice?
- You forgot the sash.
- You're right.
This completes the ensemble.
All right. Got my boots.
Now I've got the suit on. How am I supposed to know what to leave?
- Maybe there's a list.
- A list. How silly of me.
Of course there's a list.
Careful, Dad!
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay!
- Look! You're flying!
It's okay. I'm used to it.
I lived through the '60s.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Nice teeth.
Who's down there?
It's the holidays.
Come on. Come on.
Charlie, I need a little help down here!
Whoa! How'd you do that?
What'd it feel like, Dad?
It felt like
America's Most Wanted.
Now, pull me in, quick.
We gotta get outta here.
Thanks. We gotta go home.
How do you start this thing?
Just like that!
Whoa!
This could be a really long night.
Do it again, Dad. Please.
I can't. That thing's empty.
There's nothin' in the bag.
Even if there was, d-didn't you notice there's no chimney?
Where there's no chimney, there's no fireplace.
Are you growling at me?
Look, Comet, like I said, there is nothing left--
That's so weird, 'cause
I know when I did-- that--
No, no, no, no, no!
Hold it!
There's no chimney here. Can you hear me? No chimney, all right?
Lookin' good, Dad.
You have got to be kidding!
Come on!
Look at the size of this thing.
Weird! Ow!
Ouch! Oh!
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.
How come your clothes are so baggy?
Because Santa is watchin' his saturated fats.
- How come you don't have a beard?
- Because I shaved!
Do you want this doll or not?
Go back to sleep.
You're supposed to drink the milk.
Look, I am lactose intolerant.
And I am just about this close to taking all those presents back up the chimney with me.
''Supposed to drink the milk.''
Shut your eyes.
Yo!
How do you get in without a fireplace?
I don't know.
One just kind of appeared.
Awesome!
Oh, boy!
Charlie, look at the clouds over here.
Aren't they pret--
Charlie!
All right.
Mornin', fellas.
Mornin', sport.
We're done, Comet. Ho-ho-ho.
Back to the house.
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.
When I wake up,
I'm gettin' a CAT scan!
- Is this okay, Dad?
- No, it's not okay!
Hey, does this look like home to you guys?
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!
Where you goin'?
Come back here! Aww!
In the silence of the night
- When the snow
- Hey, hey!
- Lies soft and still
- Hey, buddy!
- You, sir! Hey!
- You can see a magic light
And hear the ring of Christmas bells
- Can you hear me?
- Though the night seems long and dark
- It is the earth
- What's that?
-Just gone to sleep
- I don't know.
- I think it's the North Pole.
- The stars that dot
- That's the North Pole?
- The sky above
- Hey, buddy, we need some help.
- Hold you in
- Hello!
- Their precious keep
- What are you doing?
- So close your eyes and come with me
The Christmas bells will bring you home
Hey, look!
Here comes the new Santa!
And now with song we fill the night
While magic dances in the light
To wish you now and all the year
Thejoy that comes with Christmas cheer
- Sit back.
- Hear our voices fill the air
To drive the winter's cold away
And so our hearts with all will share
The love that comes with Christmas day
The love that comes with Christmas day
The Christmas bells will bring you home
- Where are all the grown-ups?
- This is so cool.
Stay here.
Hey, kid, kid.
Kid, who's in charge here?
You are. And I'm not a kid. I've pointy shoes that are older than you.
I'm an elf.
Uh, you guys, or you girls--
Who gives the orders? Who's your boss?
- You are.
- No, no, no. Uh--
- W-Who's the head elf?
- You are.
Hey! Who's causin' all the trouble around here?
- He is.
- She is.
Excuse me. Are we on a coffee break?
-We don't drink coffee.
-Then I guess the break is over!
Back to work. Thanks.
Take it easy on her, will ya?
Who are you?
I'm Bernard.
Nice to meet ya, Santa.
I'm not Santa! I've had a rough night.
There's been dogs barkin', guns goin' off.
Look, my back's killin' me.
Have you ever tried to shove a sea kayak down a chimney?
- I'm tired of this small talk.
- Hmm.
The other Santa disappeared, right?
Wait a minute.
Hey, I know where this is goin'.
It wasn't my fault.
The other guy fell. It was an accident.
I've got homeowner's insurance and a good attorney.
Not as good as my wife's, but let's not open up that wound.
Hold it a minute.
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How did you know the other guy was gone?
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't want a drink.
I'm thirsty and hungry too.
Charlie, I thought I told you to stay in the sleigh.
-Who's this?
-This-- This is my son, Charlie.
I'm sorry. Charlie, this is Buh, Beh, Beh--
- Bernard.
- Bernard.
- Hi, Bernard.
- Hiya, sport.
- Hey, Dad, he called me ''sport'' just like you.
- Wonderful.
Hey, you know what.
I got somethin' for you.
Okay, now hold out your hand, all right?
Now, be very careful.
This is very old, just like me.
Shake it up, Charlie.
Wow.
Why don't you, uh, hold onto it for me for a while.
- It might come in handy.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
I promise I'll take real good care of it.
- Make sure you do.
- I will.
Hey, Dad, look!
Huh. Fabulous ball.
- Hey, Barabbas.
- Bernard!
Bernard. Can we take a direct flight back to reality, or do we have to change planes in Denver?
Uh, Larry, take Charlie here and get him some chow.
- No, Larry, don't do that. Charlie!
- He'll be okay.
Follow me. You'll want to get out of those clothes.
I-- Uh-- No, look, Barnaby,
I just wanna go home.
Look, I am not Santa Claus!
Ahh!
Did you or did you not read the card?
- Yeah, I read the card.
- Then you're the new Santa.
In putting on the hat and jacket you accepted the contract.
- What contract?
- The card in the Santa suit.
You said you read it, right?
So when you put on the suit, you fell subject to the Santa Clause.
- Here.
- The Santa Claus?
Oh, you mean the guy that fell off my roof?
No, no, no, not Santa Claus, the person.
Santa Clause, the clause.
What?
- Look, you're-- you're a businessman, right?
- Yeah.
Okay. A clause, as in the last line of a contract.
- You got the card?
- Oh!
Okay, look.
The Santa Clause:
''In putting on this suit and entering the sleigh...
''the wearer waives any and all rights to any previous identity, real or implied,
''and fully accepts the duties and responsibilities of Santa Claus...
''in perpetuity until such time that wearer becomes unable to do so... by either accident or design.''
- What does that mean?
- It means you put on the suit, you're the big guy.
- That's ridiculous.
I didn't put on the suit just to--
- Try to understand this!
Oo-oo-ooh!
Let me explain something to you, okay?
Toys have to be delivered. I'm not gonna do it. It's not my job. I'm just an elf.
It's Santa's job, but Santa fell off a roof, your roof.
You read the card, you put on the suit.
That clearly falls under the Santa Clause.
- So now you're Santa, okay?
- A question.
- What?
- When can I get outta here?
- Dad, you gotta see this place.
- You leave tomorrow morning.
You have 1 1 months to get your affairs in order, and you're due back here Thanksgiving.
- I'm not comin' back here on Thanksgiving.
- I'll ship the list to your house.
- What list?
- Come on, now. The list.
- He's makin'a list
- Checkin'it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Look, you put a ''P'' next to the kids who are nice and a ''C'' next to the naughty ones.
- ''P'' and ''C''?
- Yeah. ''P'' for present,
''C'' for coal, right, Bernard?
- Right.
- Wait a minute.
How do I know who's good and bad?
- You'll know.
- What if I don't want to do this?
-Don't even kid about a thing like that.
-Why not?
What if I don't buy into this Santa Clause thing?
What if I choose not to believe it?
Then there would be millions of disappointed children around the world.
You see, children hold the spirit of Christmas within their hearts.
You wouldn't want to be responsible for killing the spirit of Christmas, now, would you, Santa?
Judy will take you to your room. Get out of the suit. It needs to be cleaned.
- And taken in.
- Then get some sleep.
We've got a lot of work to do and only a year in which to do it.
-Judy.
- Santa.
- Scott Calvin.
- Follow me.
- I'll just take the next train.
- Dad, come on!
Charlie!
- Come on, Dad!
- Charlie, wait up!
- That's funny. I like that.
- I like that too. But I don't like--
Wow!
Can I get you anything?
The kitchen's always open.
How about a stiff drink?
You should get some sleep.
Here are your pyjamas.
I'll be right back.
Oh, oh, look,Judy.
Look. Look over there.
There's a--
Look. Look over there.
I know.
Look. Look over there.
There's a canoe. Aha, it's true.
Oh, look, there's an emu.
- Look at him.
- Shoo.
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.
- I brought you some cocoa.
- No, thanks.
My own recipe. Took me
1 200 years to get it right.
- 1 200 years?
- That's right.
You know, I must say, you look pretty good for your age.
Thanks, but I'm seeing someone in wrapping.
This is good.
This is really good.
Not too hot, extra chocolate, shaken, not stirred.
You look distressed.
Distressed?
I'm way past distressed.
- Why's that?
- I'm talking to an elf.
And I stopped believing in Santa Claus a long time ago.
That's not surprising.
Most grown-ups can't believe in magic.
It just... sort of grows out of them.
Look, you're a nice little elf.
- Thanks.
- But this is a dream.
I mean, this is fabulous.
Is that a polar bear directin' traffic down there?
I-- I see it, but I don't believe it.
- You're missing the point.
- What is the point?
Seeing isn't believing; believing is seeing.
Kids don't have to see this place to know that it's here.
They just... know.
Well, you should get some rest.
Good night, sir.
Dad!
Dad!
Wake up, sleepy!
Come on, get up!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Come on, Dad! Come on!
You should see all the neat toys.
- Stop shakin' me, Charlie.
- Come on. Get up. Get up!
- Okay!
- Come on. It's Christmas morning.
- Great! G-Go and make some coffee.
- Come on, Dad. Let's go!
Okay. Okay.
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah.Just fine.Just fine.
Are you having a heart attack?
I know CPR.
No, I was just--
- S.C.?
- Yeah, Santa Claus.
Hey. Same initials as your name, Dad.
Scott Calvin.
What?
Oh, Charlie! Oh, merry Christmas, honey!
- Did you have a good time?
- Great time! The best!
Great-- Oh, ho, Scott.
Nice P.J.s. Very festive.
- Where'd you get them?
- I don't know.
-Judy gave them to you.
-Judy. Really.
- Who?
- Up in the North Pole.
Ah, one of Santa's little helpers.
Last night, Dad and me went with the flying reindeer.
It was really neat, Mom. Dad was Santa, and Larry showed me the workshop.
-You know, where they make all the toys?
-Gee, thanks for...
- keeping his feet on the ground.
- You bet.
Honey, you go wait in the car for a minute, okay? I'll be right there.
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye, Dad. Thanks for a great night at the North Pole.
So, uh, what have you been telling him?
Nothing. It's just...
I had this really strange dream.
And I-- I must have told him all about it.
Wait!
- Charlie.
- Scott.
- Hi, Dad.
- Nice jammies.
- Thanks. About what you said in the house.
- Who showed you the workshop?
- The elf.
- How'd I get the pyjamas?
- I told you.Judy.
Oh, wait. Wait.Judy was the name of the waitress at the restaurant last night.
- Some waitress gave you pyjamas?
- What's this all about?
Dad took me to the North Pole, and Larry showed me the workshop.
- The North Pole.
- Yeah. Dad's the new Santa.
The regular Santa fell off the roof, and Dad put on the suit.
Charlie, we'll discuss this at home.
The clause.
The Santa Clause.
It's just a dream.
Stuff like that doesn't happen.
It was a dream. Come on!
I don't even wear pyjamas!
Normally I sleep naked. Buck naked.
Ha! Morning, Mrs McGloin.
Mary Catherine.
Eyes front,
Mary Catherine.
Sometimes boxer shorts.
You know.
So, remember, kids, there is nothing more painful than third degree burns.
Well, thank you,
Fireman O'Hara.
And I think the whole class will join me in saying... sorry about your partner.
Well, perhaps this is a good time to bring up the psychiatrist.
Charlie, would you like to introduce your, um--
Dr Miller?
Can I ask Dad to go first?
Well, if that's how you feel, Charlie.
That's how he feels, Neal.
Come on. Nice sweater, buddy.
This is my dad, Scott Calvin.
He's got a really neat job.
- Thank you, Charlie.
- My dad is Santa Claus.
Oh, boy! I think what he means is,
I'm like Santa Claus.
We're both giving.
We're both jolly.
And we both work very hard one day a year.
- Oh, boy.
- That's not what I mean, Dad.
Look, on Christmas Eve, my dad pushed Santa off the roof.
- No, Charlie-- Ch-- Charlie.
- Santa disappeared and my dad took his place.
- Charlie!
- Then I went with him to deliver all the presents.
Then the reindeer flew us to the
North Pole where the head elf,
- Charlie.
- Bernard, gave me this.
Look, I work for a toy company.
I deliver toys all over the country.
So, in a way,
I'm like Santa Claus.
- Yes, sweetheart?
- Do you make the toys?
No, stupid, the elves do!
Bobby, we don't say ''stupid,'' and we don't say ''elves.''
They're little people.
- No, but they really are elves.
- Whatever, honey.
- Which one's your favourite reindeer?
- Comet.
Uh, I, I, I don't have a favourite.
So, let me get this straight, Santa.
You mean, when I grow up, if I wanna be Santa Claus, all I gotta do is push you off a roof?
All right, he said that. He said that it was the best Christmas he ever had.
- Oh, big surprise. What do you think?
- It's just nice to hear it from him.
- Is that a problem with you?
- That's my responsibility, isn't it?
- All right. So?
May I speak, please?
I am a doctor.
No, he's not.
He's a psychiatrist.
Please. Go ahead, Dr Miller.
I guess we know who's the teacher's pet.
Scott! Oh, grow up.
The reason we're here is that this is far more serious... than a boy believing or not believing in Santa Claus.
That's right, because Charlie thinks that this whole thing actually happened.
Scott, what was the last thing you and Charlie did... before you went to bed
Christmas Eve?
We shared a bowl of sugar, did some shots of brown liquor, played with my shotguns; field dressed a cat; looked for women.
- I read him a book.
- What book?
Uh, Hollywood Wives.
The Night Before Christmas, folks.
Come on!
And did you go to the North Pole?
T-This is ridiculous.
I don't have time for this.
Ridiculous or not, Scott, for Charlie, this isn't some dream.
It is real.
You need to sit down with Charlie. Explain to him... you are not Santa Claus.
They're like the bears at the North Pole, Dad.
Charlie, I already told ya.
We did not go to the North Pole.
- That was a dream.
- You're in denial, Dad.
Denial. You don't even know what that means.
Well, you are.
I know what happened.
How do you know that?
How? You don't have any proof.
- Proof?
- Why can't we both think of it as just a great dream and forget about it?
What about this? Remember all the neat stuff inside?
Charlie, this is a toy.
We used to make things like this at work, but no one bought 'em.
Here. I don't wanna talk about this any more.
I know who you are, Dad.
You'll figure it out soon enough.
There are a lot of kids that believe in you. You can't let them down.
Charlie, you're wrong.
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
Rollin'
Keep those reindeer rollin'
Okay, you better watch out
You better not cry
-You better not pout I'm tellin'you why
-Come on, Dancer. Come on, Prancer.
- Santa Claus is coming
- Whoa! We can't stop.
- To town
- But I have to go to the bathroom.
I told you, you should've gone before we left the North Pole.
And rummy tum-tums
Whoa! Right here.
Turn over here.
Curly-haired dolls that toddle and coo
Elephant spokes and kiddie cars too
- Where is he?
- Well, he could be in his room, jumping up and down on his bed wearing a red hat and galoshes.
I don't care what Neal's doing.
Where's Charlie?
Oh, ho, ho.
Oh, I see, I see.
Well, if you can't be father of the year, why not be Father Christmas, huh?
Charlie, it's just not logical.
How can one man in one night... visit all the children of the world?
Not everyone celebrates Christmas.
And I think there's some sort of time continuum that breaks down once Santa's in his sleigh.
What about fireplaces?
A lot of people don't have them.
How does Santa visit those people?
He turns into Jell-O and--
The fireplace kind of appears, and he goes through it like this.
What about the reindeer?
- Have you ever seen a reindeer fly?
- Yes.
- Well, I haven't.
- Have you ever seen a million dollars?
No!
Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Hey, Neal.
Howdy, sport.
- Hi, Dad.
- You wanna take a walk?
I wanna talk to you.
- Sure. I'll get my coat.
- Okay. Hustle up.
Scott? Can I have a minute?
Sure.
I think Charlie is conflicted at the moment.
Wow. Really?
Boy. Hmm. Appreciate your analysis. I really do.
But, boy, you got more important things to worry about, you know.
Like, where are you gonna get more sweaters after the circus pulls outta town?
Scott! I mean, you're not listening.
We are very concerned about this.
Concerned about what?
This--
If Charlie spending time with you is the best thing for him.
You were right about the sweater, okay?
Do you think by next year
I'll be big enough to drive the sleigh all by myself?
- No!
- But I've been practising.
No, that's not what I'm talkin' about.
Charlie, hold on a second.
We've got to talk about this Santa Claus thing.
Charlie, there-- there is no--
No what, Dad?
There's no reason why we have to tell anybody about the North Pole.
- Why not?
- Well, sometimes some things, big things, should remain un-- unsaid, like between two people--
- Oh, you mean like a secret.
- Yes. Like a secret.
Let's keep it a secret.
How come?
Because of Mom and Neal.
Not just because of them.
There's school.
Everybody thinks-- Well, it's not important what they think.
It--
How does five bucks sound to ya?
This is something I really want you to do for me, sport.
I want to keep this secret.
Will ya do that, please?
- Okay, Dad.
- All right.
Great.
You don't have to worry about the Santa Claus thing any more.
So when do I get the five bucks?
... 1 5 in the morning.
It's gonna be a beautiful day.
Spend the day with me,
Larry B.
Huh?
Something's wrong with the mirror.
What? Something's wrong with the scale.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh--
Hmm. I'll have a field green salad and-- Oh, my God.
- What the--
- What? Scott?
Calvin?
Sorry, um, the dry cleaner in my neighbourhood went up in smoke.
Some big chemical fire.
All my clothes, poof, gone.
God. Your-- Your weight.
What happened?
Bee sting.
Evidently I'm allergic.
Almost killed me. But the guy at the emergency room says... the swelling will go down.
I hope. So, did I miss anything?
No, we were, uh, just about to order lunch.
Great! I'm starving.
I'll have a salad and iced tea and dressing on the side.
Uh, pasta and tomatoes, uh, and very light on the oil. Can you do that?
And I'll have a Caesar.
No dressing.
And one of those home-made cookies, the warm chocolate chip. No nuts.
And, uh, a little slice of cheesecake.
Uh, creme brulee... and, um, hot fudge sundae, extra hot fudge.
On the side.
- Anything to drink?
- Ice-cold milk.
- Stung by a bee, Scott?
- A big bee.
Finished?
Okay, now, remember.
This is just a storyboard.
But here is our preliminary...
Total Tank TV spot.
Okay, now, we've got Santa.
He's up in the North Pole.
He's gettin' ready for... Christmas!
- Oh, no.
- Problem?
It's just a little thing.
The elves.
- What about the elves?
- They look so funny.
They're supposed to look funny.
They're elves.
Just my opinion.
Can't they look a little younger... with silver specks on their cheeks?
- Can we continue here?
- Okay.
Now, this year Santa's not goin' out in a sleigh.
This time he's goin'
Total Tank.
Wait a minute! No way! No way Santa's goin' anywhere without his sleigh.
He would if he's tryin' to sell the Total Tank.
Well, isn't that a pretty picture.
Santa's rollin' down the block in a panzer.
Well, kids, I-- I certainly hope you've been good this year.
'Cause it looks like Santa just took out the Pearson home.
- Incoming!
- Oh, please.
And another thing.
What about the reindeer?
Reindeer and Santa. Santa and reindeer.
I-It's kind of a package deal.
- Calvin.
- You don't believe in Santa, do ya?
Calvin, can we get back to the presentation?
I'm not done yet.
Since we've opened this box, have any of you tried to build the Total Tank?
It's got 1 0,000 parts, and even if you do get it together, it breaks ten minutes later.
- Then you gotta spend more money just to buy new parts.
- I thought that was the whole point.
No, no, no, no.
What we gotta do is develop a, a basic, simple, inexpensive toy... that will nurture a child's creative thinking.
- Calvin--
- Here, try the brown ones.
Can I see you outside a minute?
I don't know what's happening to you.
You're starting to look like the Pillsbury dough boy.
- Y-You're falling apart.
- I know! I know.
-I don't know what came over me.
-W-Well, just get some help.
You know, y-you should s-see a doctor, a shrink, a dietician, anything.
Just get some help.
Okay, Scott. Time is up.
- Let's get over here and check your pulse.
- All right.
Okay, hmm?
Huh? Well, nuts. I--
Oh, no, uh, your pulse is great. I--
Well, I-I don't know, Scott.
Y-You're as healthy as a horse.
Yeah, Clydesdale.
Okay, look. So, what?
You put on a little weight.
A little weight? Does this look like a little weight to you?
Well, weight can fluctuate from year to year.
Fluctuate? You make it sound like I'm retainin' water.
I've gained 45 pounds in a week.
Pete, what's happenin' to me?
- Well, what's your diet like?
- Milk and cookies.
- Really?
- But I don't finish all the milk.
Well, then, there is your problem.Just try to cut back on the sweets, okay?
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
How fast does hair grow?
Facial hair?
-What?
-I shave in the morning and in the afternoon I look like this.
Well, it could be a hormonal imbalance.
- That would explain the mood swings.
- Mood swings?
- Yeah, well, look at my hair.
It's turnin' grey.
- Oh, it's middle age, buddy.
It happens. And with that body, you should be thankful you have hair.
Look, i-if it bothers you, you can dye it, and you should diet!
Ah, just kidding.
Okay, up with the shirt.
Let's take a listen to the old ticker. Whoa. Okay.
Ooh, it's cold.
Over here, Steve!
I'm open!
What?
I want some ballet slippers.
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Hold on now.
- Wait a minute. Wait, I'm not done.
Fax me. Hi. Hey, this probably looks pretty odd, doesn't it?
- These kids lined up all by themselves.
- Scott,
I think it's safe to say you're taking this Santa thing to an unhealthy level.
Here's my card.
Call me.
Scott, I-- I really have to tell you that this is beginning to scare me.
I never in my wildest--
Well, no, okay, maybe my wildest--
But certainly never in my normal dreams would I--
- But then this is Scott we're talking about and I--
- Laura, the point.
It's just I never thought you would stoop to changing your physical appearance... in order to make
Charlie like you.
- Do you have any concept of how dangerous this is to a little boy?
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa. ''How dangerous''?
- Mom, what's the matter?
- Come on, Charlie, we're going home.
- But we just started.
Well, a--
You let him stay. I'll go.
If you don't get your act together,
Scott, so help me--
- Watch it, folks.
- I will just-- Oh!
- Mom!
- Come on. Move it, lady!
Kick it!
- Hi there.
- Hi. I got a delivery for S.C.
- You S.C.?
- Scott Calvin, that's me.
Sign here, please.
-All right.
-Thanks. I'll get your packages.
- Packages?
- Yeah, there's quite a few of them.
Great. I'll leave the door open.
Just leave them inside here.
Will do.
It's the list.
''Armand Assante''?
Yo!
Hold it! Hold-- Oh!
Hold it!
- You! You! Take that! Come on! Come on!
- Stay away from the truck.
What am I supposed to do with all these packages, guys? Come on.
Aah.
You know, I knew it. I knew that-- that something was going on. I just-- I--
What I can't believe is that he would go behind our backs all this time, confusing Charlie again just--
I-- I-- What are we--
What are we supposed to do?
Well, there's one obvious alternative.
Okay.
Aah.
- Annie, nice.
- Beep!
-Johnny, naughty.
-Johnny, wait up.
Gary, nice.
Veronica, very nice.
In your dreams, sleigh boy.
Huh?
I'm in big trouble.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Judge Wayland's office.
Charlie, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?
It's okay, honey. Come on.
We won't be long.
Are we doing the right thing, Neal?
-Something needs to shake Scott.
-Yeah, but--
But to-- to take away his visitation rights.
Honey, the man is delusional.
Okay, okay, so maybe I'm having second thoughts, kind of. I just--
I mean, what was so bad about
Charlie believing in Santa?
Well, he's a little old.
Oh, come on, Laura.
Don't you remember when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
I was Charlie's age,
I guess, I--
I wrote Santa a letter every week that year.
Well, you know, okay, you know, maybe--
Maybe not every week, but--
Boy, I really wanted a ''Mystery Date'' game.
Do you remember those?
No. Of course you don't.
You know, no one does.
I-- I don't even think they make them any more, but--
Well, anyway--
Christmas morning came and--
Oh, I got dozens of presents.
Oh, I got everything.
Except ''Mystery Date.''
I was three, and it was an Oscar Meyer wienie whistle.
Christmas came.
No wienie whistle.
And that's when
I stopped believing.
You were three?
Yeah.
Oh, Neal.
-Where's Charlie? I want to talk to him.
-He's with the judge.
Dad!
It's all okay.
I told the judge everything... about you and the North Pole.
After reviewing all of your testimonies,
I've come to a very difficult decision.
I'm sorry to do this in light of the holiday season, but in the best interest of the child,
I'm granting the petition of Dr and Mrs Miller.
Mr Calvin, as of today, all of your visitation rights are suspended... pending a hearing after the first of the year.
- Hey, Neal.
- Scott.
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Don't make me beat you up, Neal.
Oh, would Santa really beat someone up?
- I'm this close.
- So you still believe you're Santa?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
Of course you are, Dad.
How can you say that?
-Think of all those kids.
-The only kid I'm thinkin' about is you.
Dad, I'm fine.
You can't let them down.
- They all believe in you!
- Charlie, listen.
You listen!
You think you know who he is. You don't!
Charlie. Honey, listen.
You're confused.
I know exactly who he is.
Charlie, he's not Santa!
He is too, Santa!
We went to the North Pole together.
I saw it. The elves are real old even though they look like me.
Bernard called me sport,
'cause he knew everything.
Right, Dad?
Remember!
Thank you, Charlie.
Thank you.
I love you, Dad.
Could you guys leave us alone for a minute?
I mean, so I can say goodbye to him properly?
You saw!
You saw the ball come to life.
You bet I did.
-Well, Charlie, I guess I-- I better go.
-I'll get my stuff.
Well, wait, sport. Sport. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think it's a much better idea if you just stayed here with your mom.
I wanna be with you, Dad.
Boy, I love hearing you say that.
You mean I can go?
Boy, this bird is dry. Haven't you people heard about basting?
Bernard!
- Hiya, sport.
- Bernard, can I go?
Please, can I go, Bernard?
It's okay with me.
Charlie, if, uh--
Charlie?
Scott!
Charlie!
This is our perpetrator.
Scott Calvin, 38 years old.
Believes himself to be Santa Claus.
Ladies and gentlemen, this one's not gonna be easy to find.
Uh, won't the bright red suit and beard give him away?
Charlie's got some great ideas on how to keep you safe.
Santa, this is Quintin, head of research and development.
- Quintin, good to meet ya.
- Hello, Santa.
Charlie and I have put our heads together, and I think we've got a few surprises for you.
This is some of the best stuff that's come out of the workshop since the ball.
Fabulous.
What happens if I fall off the roof?
Is this the most current photo you have?
Hold on.
- Hello?
- Mom.
- Oh, Charlie. Oh, my God.
Honey, how are you? Are you--
Are-- Where are you? Are you okay?
I'm fine.
We're up at the North Pole.
Charlie, are you sure you're okay?
I'm terrific! I'm helping the elves build a new sleigh.
We're trying for a vertical takeoff.
Well, gotta go. The elves need me.
- No, Charlie, wait. No, don't hang up the phone, honey.
- Don't worry, Mom. Everything's fine.
- See you at Christmas.
- Charlie, don't-- Ah.
Fireplaces will no longer be a problem.
It's a new fabric.
Completely flame retardant.
- It's light, yet durable.
- And you can wear the jumpsuit under your coat and pants.
But what do I do if I fall off a roof?
We'll cordon off a three-block radius around Dr Miller's house.
Now, Calvin is to be apprehended unharmed.
And remember, he'll probably be dressed like Santa Claus.
Give it your best shot
'Cause what you got is oh, so sweet
- Freeze!
- What the--
I need a routine
So gimme all your lovin'
- It's not even my suit. It's a rental.
- All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
''From Comet, To Santa.''
Did you make the card?
It's a nice rope.
Just in case I fall off the roof?
Comet, this means a lot to me.
Thanks, buddy.
And if I blow my top
Will you let it go to your head
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
All right, let's go!
- You ready to go, sport?
- You betcha, Dad.
- Gimme all your lovin'
- Now Dasher, now Dancer!
Now Prancer and Vixen!
- All your hugs and kisses too
On Comet, on Cupid!
On Donner and Blitzen!
Bye-bye. Bye, Quintin.
Bye, Peewee.
Merry Christmas.
Take your time.
Turn to your right.
Hello!
No.
- Charlie, stay in your seat.
- I gotta show you this.
Radar-jamming jingle bells, snow screen,
DC-1 0 alert and air freshener.
- Wow.
- And most important of all, your hat.
- My hat?
- It's lined with a two-way radio.
Microphone's in here.
It connects you directly to Judy.
- Wait a minute. What's this?
- Oh, that's a C.D.
- Compact disc.
- No. Cookie/ cocoa dispenser.
The cocoa comes out nice and hot.
- And... out pops the cookie.
- Gimme all your lovin'
- How could I have done this without you, Charlie?
- You couldn't.
-You're fatter this year.
-Thank you very much. You've grown too.
And you were a very good girl this year, but I want you to go back to sleep, okay?
- I think the milk's a little sour.
- It's soy milk.
- Huh?
- You said you were lactose intolerant.
I did say that, didn't I?
Thanks for remembering.
Go to sleep.
- Merry Christmas, Sara.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
Look, there's Mom and Neal's street!
Can we go there next?
- Sure.
- I made something for them at the workshop.
Freeze!
Ah, ho, ho.
You officers really gave me a start.
Merry Christmas, guys.
- Not for you, fat boy.
- ''Fat boy''? Guys.
- Uh-uh-uh. Nice and easy now.
- Oh!
Guys, guys, I got a lot of work to do.
This is a big mistake, really.
You gotta watch the suit too. This is so old. It's an antique, you know.
- Where's the boy?
- He's in the sleigh.
We got Calvin.
We're bringing him out.
Santa, are you okay?
Over. Over.
- Watch your head.
- Santa, are you all right?
- Santa?
- It'll be okay, kids.
- Let him go! Let Santa go!
Honey, I'm sure
Charlie's fine.
We've got a problem. Santa was at the Miller's, but he's not responding.
Well, time to deploy E.L.F.S.
- Let's go!
- Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Move it!
Look, I know you're Scott Calvin.
You know you're Scott Calvin.
So let's make this simple.
I say, name.
You say, Scott Calvin.
Name?
Kriss Kringle.
- Name?
- Sinter Klas.
- Name?
- Pere Noel.
Buono Natale.
Pelz-Nicole.
Topo Gigio.
Okay, Calvin. Maybe a couple of hours in the tank will change your mind.
- Charlie?
- Yeah?
Don't worry.
We're the good guys.
Come on.
Let's go save Santa.
We can't. The police are watching this place.
Yeah, they probably are.
But you see, we weren't figuring on walking out the front door.
We find that we can get around a lot faster if we fly.
Now... grab hold of my hand.
And hang on tight.
- And Charlie?
- Yeah?
Don't ever try this without elf supervision.
Hmm? Ah!
We're looking for Santa Claus.
Go home, kids.
Visiting hours are over.
We're not kids, and we're not visiting.
- We're here to bust out my dad.
- You're the Calvin boy.
Who-- Who are these other kids?
We're your worst nightmare.
Elves with attitude.
Shouldn't have had that doughnut.
Oh!
Untie me! I mean it!
Untie--
- Charlie!
- Are you okay, Dad?
I am now.
- How'd you do that?
- Tinsel. Not just for decoration.
Hmm.
Hey, excuse me. Can I get some of that tinsel?
Mom?
Mom!
Neal. I'm home!
Charlie?
- Charlie?
- Charlie.
- Oh, my God, Charlie.
Sweetheart. Oh, God.
Come here. Come here.
Oh, my boy.
Oh, my sweetheart.
Oh! My boy, you're home!
Oh, I missed you so much.
How are you?
- I'm fine, Mom.
- Are you okay? Look at me.
- Oh, Charlie. I missed you, honey.
- Mom, I'm fine. It's okay.
- We were so worried about you. Look at you.
- Mom, put me down. Stop kissing me!
I don't have a lot of time.
Did you leave the gifts
I made under the tree?
- You bet I did.
- We better go.
- No, Charlie. No, no, no.
- No! No, wait, Charlie.
It's okay, Laura.
Actually, I--
I think it's a much better idea...
- that you stay here with your Mom and Neal.
- Really?
- But, Dad--
- No buts, Charlie.
I can't be selfish.
I can't be with you all the time.
We're a family.
You, me, your mom... and Neal.
And they need to be with you too.
I miss you too much.
Come here a minute.
Ah, listen to me.
Come on, listen. There's--
There's a lot of kids out there.
Okay? Millions of kids.
And they're--
They all-- They all believe in me.
They're countin' on me, Charlie. And I--
I'm not gonna let them down.
I got a lot of work to do.
So I can't be selfish either.
You gave me a wonderful gift, Charlie.
Listen, a wonderful gift.
You believed in me when nobody else did.
You helped make me Santa.
Selfish? Come on.
You're the least-- the least selfish person I know.
I love you, Santa Claus.
I love you, son.
Shh.
It's okay.
Okay. It's okay. Shh.
Laura, what do you think? Christmas Eve you guys spend with Charlie?
Oh, my God.
It's you.
It really is you.
You really are...
Santa Claus.
Pretty cool, huh?
Oh, my God.
And your parents thought
I'd never amount to anything.
Oh, wait. Don't go yet.
I have something for you. I--
It's Santa!
- Scott.
- Neal.
- Santa?
- It's okay, Neal.
Here.
It's, um--
Well, it's--
It's my Christmas present for you.
It's the, um-- It's the custody papers.
And I want you to come and see
Charlie as often as you can.
You can count on it.
Thanks, Laura.
Merry Christmas.
What's all this boo-hooing goin' on here? Hey, how ya doin'?
It's nothin', Bernard.
I'm just saying goodbye to Charlie.
What goodbye? Charlie, you still got the glass ball, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, all you gotta do... is shake it whenever you want to see your dad.
- Really?
- He can come back to see you... anytime day or night.
Hey, have I ever steered ya wrong?
Nice sweater.
Hey, did we make this?
Laura.
He's sucking us into his delusions.
Look at the elaborate measures he's taken.
Neal, relax.
I'll explain it to you later.
Where'd he go?
Go, go, go, go!
Team one, heads up!
- Okay, stand back, folks.
Give us some room.
- I'm scared, Dad.
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks. Return to your homes!
- Stay off the street. Come on, folks.
Let us do our job here.
- Oh, my gosh. Um--
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.
Um, you know, you don't have to send anybody-- Oh, my gosh, wait!
- Hey!
- He's my ex-husband, and he's already up the chimney.
Chief, look up there.
Oh, Santa!
Santa Claus.
Look!
What is it?
Oh, wow!
Up there! Do you see it?
Hey, do you see it?
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Bye, Dad.
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!
- I'm sorry, Charlie.
- That's okay, Neal.
You were just denying your inner child.
You're gonna make a great psychiatrist one day, kid.
No, I think I'm going to go into the family business.
Look out below!
My wienie whistle.
Bye, Santa Claus. Bye.
- Merry Christmas.
- See you next year.
Charlie?
Time to come inside.
Mom, this stupid ball's not working.
Shoot.
- Hey, sport.
- Dad!
You miss me already?
I've been gone, what? Ten minutes.
Gimme a break.
I was on my way to Cleveland.
Come here and give me a hug.
Oh!
- Do you wanna go for a quick ride?
- Yeah!
-Uh--
-Of course, it's up to your mom.
Please, Mom.
Go on. Get outta here.
All right. Hold on.
- On our way.
- Bye, Mom.
Just--Just a quick one.
And, uh, not over any oceans, Scott.
- Bye, Mom!
- Scott.
- Bye.
- Scott!
Santa!
- Did you try that pumpkin pie?
- No.
It looked good, but how many desserts does my mother need to make?
L don't know. l think carl had one of everything though.
L think Jo and carl want to get married.
Yeah, it seems that they really love each other.
-Oh, l think they're in love. Don't you?
- Yeah.
It's just hard to tell sometimes from the outside.
L think my mother would love for them to get married.
Are you kidding? she's probably got the number of the catering hall on speed dial.
Thanks for staying out so late.
Happy Thanksgiving.
L love you.
You're wearing my favorite suit.
L just can't wake up today. l don't know what's wrong with me.
You have a good sleep?
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
L'm sorry about tonight. l've really got to go to this thing.
It's okay.
Do you want to have dinner in the city tomorrow?
- Yeah.
-okay.
Hat?
The damn car's acting up again.
It starts knocking when l turn the heater on.
Hy don't you get it checked?
Kenny said there was nothing wrong with it.
You never should've bought a used car.
It's always made that knocking sound.
Is it supposed to make that sound?
Of course not. Are they up yet?
Jo said she wanted to get up early.
Knowing her, she'll probably sleep all day.
Ah, shit!
Hy?
Hy are you up so early?
Mom and Dad are making so much fucking noise in the kitchen.
Hat are they doing? should we wake those two up? should we wake those two up?
-L can't hear you!
-should we wake those two up?
Ell, if they ever want to get into the city, they should get up.
Hey, Jo? e'd better not.
Yeah, we'd better not.
Um, you know, house rules and all.
Ooh, um... Hmm. Did you sleep well?
Hmm-mm. l don't like sleeping without you.
Yeah, well, your mother made it very clear that we shouldn't, uh... hat does she think we do back home?
You know?
Josephine!
Morning, Mrs. Malone.
Oh, carl. Did you sleep well?
Yes. l had a wonderful night's sleep, thank you.
Oh, good, good.
Uh, what is it that smells so incredible?
Oh, l was just making a little breakfast bacon and eggs, sausage, pancakes, whatever you'd like.
Yum.
Come on, Jo. ake up! soup's on!
Ould you like some Entenmann's?
E got a really good price on this cake.
Everything was two-for-one.
Yeah. l mean, it was some sale.
Here we go.
How about some cinnamon filbert ring, huh?
Mm, l don't want that.
L don't normally eat this much for breakfast.
Hy do you... hy do you put this junk in your hair, huh? hy?
This is an excellent cinnamon filbert ring, Rita.
Are you at least going to comb this mess before you go outside?
- Hmm-mm.
-l see carl doesn't find it necessary to deface himself.
Carl, show Mom your nipples.
Finish your breakfast.
L'm done.
Are you wearing that little skirt?
You'll freeze to death.
Dad, drive us to the train station!
Try to help her, carl.
- Hiya, Dad.
- Hey, kid. hat brings you here?
L got to talk to Mom about something.
- Just in time for breakfast.
-oh, l'm not hungry.
- Good morning, my darling.
- Good morning.
- How are you?
-l'm good. How you doin', Miss Malone?
Oh, fine.
E should show this to someone who would understand it.
Ait a minute. l don't want to make a big deal out of this.
-Ho knows what this is.
- Ah, don't worry.
E'll keep it in the family.
"Dearest, please accept this token of my love and devotion.
L'm grateful for what we have, but l want so much more.
In short, l want you entirely.
Alas, as Andrew Marvell wrote,
'Therefore, the love which us doth bind but fate so enviously debars is the conjunction of the mind and opposition of the stars.'
Love forever, sandy." carl, you're a very smart young man. hat is this?
L don't understand poetry.
Ell, Andrew Marvell was a 17th-century poet, a predecessor of shakespeare's, one of the Elizabethan metaphysical poets.
This poem...
Basically, the poem says that love binds us together and we're like, totally in sync, but it's a drag because circumstances keep us apart.
- Do you think this was written to Louis?
- No. l mean, l hope not.
- Do you know who sandy is?
- No, l have no idea.
Carl, couldn't this be a note from a barracuda who was having an affair with a married man?
-L...
-e don't know who this was written to.
Eliza, you should call Louis.
L should just call him and ask him what this is.
No, no.
L don't think that's a smart idea.
-Hy not?
-lt's very easy to lie on the phone.
See, you can't see the eyes.
The eyes always give you away.
-So what should l do?
-l suggest that we drive you into the city and you talk to him face to face. um, are you sure this is such a good idea? lt's not up to me.
Eliza, what do you think? carl, why don't you sit in the front?
You're so tall, you'll get all squished back there.
-L'll be fine, but thank you, Rita.
-sure.
Look at these hideous buildings.
Architecture is dead.
The architects have run out of ideas. lt's all references.
The Europeans may have been lmperialists, but they knew how to make a building.
You know what, you guys?
Things are fine l mean, they're great between me and Louis, you know, in... in every department.
- Everything is fine.
-l know, l know, honey. of course.
Oh, Jo, you remember your little friend vinnie Tucillo?
Uh, yeah.
Ell, Mrs. o'connor told me he was just sent to jail.
Hat took so long?
Did you hear about Mr. Andrews having an affair with a tenth-grader?
They fired him. l mean, it was some scandal.
Did you know my mom writes the society page for the Deer Park Pennysaver?
- Really?
- No.
Also, l mean, he works for a publishing company.
You know, he's got other people's manuscripts, all kinds of stuff in his briefcase.
That note could've belonged to anyone.
Jim, watch out!
- That truck, idiot!
- He's nowhere near me.
-So what are you guys gonna do today?
-shopping.
L was thinking we'd check out the Dutch modernism show at the cooper-Hewitt.
- Are you guys gonna stay in Michigan?
- Yeah.
Yeah, for now. carl's got this great job.
No, it's just construction work.
The pay's really good, so... carl, tell Mom and Dad about your novel. carl wrote a novel, everyone.
It's great. lt's just far-out. lt's brilliant.
L don't think your parents want to hear about my novel.
Mom and Dad, do you want to hear about carl's novel?
-Oh, yeah. sure, carl.
-ell, uh, Rita, it's an allegory about spiritual survival in the contemporary world.
The main character is this freak of nature.
He's this man who doesn't have a normal head.
- He was born with a dog's head.
- A dog's head?
Yeah.
You know, sort of a fantastical story.
-It's like a fable.
- Yeah, like Masterand Margarita or...
- Anial Far.
- Yeah, exactly. very Ka♪ carl, l'm not an educated woman.
-It's Dr. seuss for adults, Mom.
-oh. oh, yeah.
So everybody else in the book is normal except the man with the dog's head,
-who really only wants
-hat kind of dog?
- Dad, it's not important.
- No, no. No, no, no. lt is important.
Actually, that's very important. lt's a German shorthaired Pointer.
You see, it's actually especially important that it's a pointer because that's a crucial metaphor, because in the book, he's sort of a...
He's sort of a visionary, you know?
You know, pointing the way to salvation?
Jo loves dogs.
Remember Pepper? e had to put her to sleep.
Mother... so, uh, the man with the dog's head, who has been treated like a freak all of his life, get discovered by these people who exploit him by putting him on every daytime talk show on Tv.
But the man with the dog's head realizes he's got the ear of the entire nation, so he starts to tell people what he really thinks.
He starts to criticize society.
He starts to talk about how crass it is, how unfeeling.
And as people start to, you know, respond to his message, he develops this following, which just gets bigger and bigger until he's this huge visionary leader. oh, you mean like he can talk,
-just like a person.
-ell, yeah.
He's normal in every way except for, you know, the dog's head.
Ah. Now, how would you do that?
- Mom, it's a book, it isn't a movie.
-carl,
-how do you think up this stuff?
- Mother...
Goddamn it!
- hat the hell is that?
- hat's causing it, Dad?
L don't know. l think it's got something to do with the heater.
L told you to bring the car into Kenny. l did.
It didn't knock for him.
Louis's father had a mistress.
Louis is nothing like his father.
Ell, thank God.
But then again, who knows?
They say it's often inherited.
L just can't see Louis doing anything like that, Mom.
He's not like that.
Ell, he'd better not be.
L'm gonna go to the bathroom.
He can't fix it now, but we'll be all right if we don't turn the heater on.
No heat?
Now are you glad you wore that little skirt?
- okay, Dad, make a right on Park.
- Did you hear her?
L heard her, okay?
Are you cold back there?
- No.
- Really?
-L'm chilly.
-e're almost there, Mom.
-L want to see him alone.
-of course.
- Hello. can l help you?
- Yeah, hi.
L'd like to see Louis D'Amico in the marketing and publicity department.
- And your name is?
- Eliza D'Amico. l'm his wife.
Oh, l knew you looked familiar. e met at the party at the Rainbow Room.
-Oh, uh, cassandra.
- Yes!
-Oh, hi. lt's nice to see you.
- You too.
- This is my mother.
-oh.
Hi. l'm Louis's mother-in-law.
So nice to meet you.
You are so lucky to have Louis.
He's so sweet.
E all love Louis.
L love your what do you call that, a brooch?
Isn't it cute? Thanks.
So let me get Louis for you.
Hi. ls Louis in?
Uh-huh.
Hen will he be back?
Oh, really? okay. Thanks. Bye.
He's out. chap gave him the rest of the day off 'cause of the holidays.
But you know what you should do?
Hy don't you go back and talk to chap,
'cause he might know more.
Do you know which way to go? uh, did you hear the reading on the 23rd moved to the 25th?
Listen. l got a story for you.
Friday night, l'm at the Three Deuces, right, and l'm wasted.
And, uh, l start talking to this sweet, soft-spoken girl, right?
And l'm really digging her, but l'm not getting any vibe back, and it's not going anywhere.
Then this punk chick from the other end of the bar comes over and starts talking to us, and right off the bat,
-she starts talking about sex.
-hat did she look like?
She was se♪, in a Ruben-esque kind of way.
-She was fat?
- No, she was... voluptuous.
She was full, okay? And she starts telling me about her sex life in unbelievably explicit detail.
Isn't it weird when a total stranger tells you that much about their sex life?
L mean, that's a little desperate, right?
Desperate that's your type.
So eventually, the sweet girl goes to the restroom and l'm alone with this punk chick.
And l figure, what the hell?
Might as well add me to the list, right?
So l go, "Let's go over to my place."
And she looks at me like,
"You're disgusting!" and takes off.
-L hope that's not the end of this yarn.
- No.
Then l notice that there was a 20 bill l'd left on the bar, and it's gone, and this punk chick ripped me off.
By now l'm really bombed. lt's late. hat am l gonna do?
Now the bar's closing, they're kicking everybody out, and l offer to walk the sweet girl home.
And get this. she goes, "Let's go to your place."
- Really? Do tell.
-ell, it was a lot of fun.
And as you may know, it's been a while for me, so she had to kind of walk me through it, but we took care of business.
Next morning, l wake up with this woman, realize l have completely forgotten her name.
Ell, you're a classy guy.
L'm telling you, man, l am racking my brain.
Finally she goes to the bathroom. l start rooting through her purse.
L'm whipping things out. l pull out a credit card that says cindy Bartlett.
Shove it back in just as she comes out.
Everything's cool.
L get her outside and in a cab.
As she's getting in the cab, l say,
"lt was really nice seeing you, cindy. could l get your number?"
And she looks at me like l'm insane.
Hops in the cab, takes off.
Last night, l'm back at the Three Deuces. l'm getting bombed.
In walks the punk chick. l go,
"l'm sorry. l can't remember your name." she goes, "cindy Bartlett.
And by the way, you didn't happen to find my wallet the other night, did you?"
You banged a felon. Good for you.
Are you waiting for chap?
- Yeah.
- Are you an author?
No.
Too bad.
You'd look good on a book jacket.
My name's Eddie.
How do you do? l'm Eliza D'Amico.
My husband works here.
Oh.
L, um, have a book that they're publishing here.
- Your husband is Louis?
- Yes.
- He's a great guy.
-hat's the name of your book?
It's, uh, Earthly Delights.
Earthly Delights? oh, Edward Masler.
Oh, yeah, l read your manuscript. lt's very interesting.
- Good "interesting?"
- Yeah.
Since you're a writer, can l ask you a literary question?
You could ask me a literary question, yeah.
Have you ever heard of the poet
Andrew Marvell?
Sure, he's great. He wrote one of my all-time favorite poems,
"To His coy Mistress." ell... do you recognize this?
"Therefore the love which us doth bind but fate so enviously debars is the conjunction of the mind and opposition of the stars."
That's the end of "The Definition of Love." lt's a beautiful poem.
-It's a love poem?
- Yeah, it's full of great images.
He uses the image of himself and his true love on opposite poles of the earth.
The last line, "the opposition of the stars"' has a double meaning.
He's talking about the fact that they can't see the same stars, the same heaven, because they're on opposite sides of the planet, and also, uh, it means that their love is in opposition to the stars, against fate.
There's a great line somewhere like, um,
"our love is truly parallel... though infinite, can never meet."
Their love is perfect but impossible.
- Are you all right?
-oh, yes.
Hello, Eliza. can you give me one sec, please?
Aaron, did you fax that press release?
No, l'm, um, writing it right now.
Oh, well, please, Aaron, take your time.
L think since we've completely missed the deadline, you might as well take the whole weekend to write the tiny paragraph.
-Oops.
-sorry. l was chewing his ear off.
Ell, that's all right. lt's lucky these cubicles absorb all sound.
Otherwise...
God knows what kind of pathetic stories l'd have to hear about my employees' sex lives.
-So, Eliza, how can l help you?
-oh, uh, l made a last-minute trip into the city.
My sister's visiting, and we just thought we'd stop by and see if Louis was around.
Oh, l'm sorry. l gave Louis the rest of the day off.
L don't know where he went.
He might check in.
Oh, you know what? The book party tonight.
L might have an invitation somewhere.
L have one.
Oh, very nice.
- Thank you.
-l'm sure Louis will be there.
All right. Thank you. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Your name is sandra?
No, cassandra.
That's beautiful.
- Thanks.
-l bet a lot of people call you sandy.
No.
No one's ever called me sandy.
- No?
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
Cordelia Press.
Chap doesn't know where Louis is, but he said that he should be at this book party later.
L don't know. hat should we do?
Here does Louis work? here is his desk?
E should take a look.
No!
L'm gonna get a paper.
Dad...
My mom's driving me insane.
Oh, sweetie, you shouldn't let them bother you.
She's so out of touch.
- Yeah, but it's not her fault.
-hy do you say that?
L mean, it's the fate of the middle class.
Everything about middle-class life you know, cars, suburbs, strip malls, tabloid television lt's all designed to keep people from having meaningful interactions.
The average American knows more about the latest maniac who keeps human heads in their freezer than they do about their own spouse.
And that's a that's You know, that
Yeah, that is the big failing of a democracy.
It tends towards the middle, towards mediocrity.
-Hat's the alternative?
-e'd be better off under an aristocracy.
L know it's not a fair system, but there's never gonna be a fair system.
At least the aristocrats had taste.
They did things with class.
Christ, they even went to the guillotine with class.
But-But what about the rest of us, the non-aristocrats?
Ell, those of us who had the ambition and intelligence and talent would find ways of joining the aristocracy, and the rest, you know, those who don't give a damn about art and culture anyways would work.
There's nothing wrong with work.
L respect the working class far more than l do the middle class.
Those people, you know, they're connected to the earth.
They have values. They have God.
Hat does the middle class have? lnfomercials.
Mm. ugh.
L have to pee again.
Try and forgive your mother. she truly is the victim of a deadly system.
L saw this on Matlock the other night.
You press the redial button, and then the phone rings the last number Louis called.
Oh, please. Mom, don't.
It's ringing.
See?
Hello, Mom.
-Hat is the matter with you?
- This is ridiculous.
- Don't, no. You're gonna mess up his desk.
-l'm looking, that's all. l'm looking.
Don't touch all of his papers.
Mom, just stop.
This is an invasion of privacy, okay?
It's one thing when you used to read my diary
-l never read your diary.
- Mom, please?
For God's sake. uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
L can't believe l'm doing this.
Hi, you've reached the hoe ofEliza and Louis. Please leave
cordelia Press.
Eliza, look at this.
That doesn't prove anything.
- Look.
- Hi, you've reached sandy and Monica.
Wee not in. Leave a essage, and wellget back to you. Thanks. ell, the pictures on the street, they're wearing the same clothes they were wearing at the party.
-Sandy could live here.
- Look at this.
There's a restaurant in the background.
You see that?
-Oh, my G lt says "Berry's"? "Berry's"?
- Yep, that's what it says.
-Ow.
-l'm worried. l'm very worried.
It still doesn't prove anything.
375 spring street.
There's that steakhouse we used to go to with Ken and Eileen.
Oh, yeah.
Hat if Louis is involved with this woman?
If Louis is cheating, l can assure you it has nothing to do with love.
L know men.
Maybe sandy's this really incredible person. lf she's so incredible, then why would she go after someone else's husband?
Maybe she's desperately in love with him.
Don't be ridiculous.
Nobody's desperately in love.
Eliza, don't worry about it.
You don't know if Louis has done anything.
It would never occur to me to write a note like this.
Anyone can copy some 17th-century
Elizabethan metaphysical poet.
You know, from a book.
That's Berry's there. Then it has to be
Louis is entering a blue door. e should look for a blue door.
E're gonna look for clues across the street, Eliza. okay.
Mom, look.
Hat?
Come on over here. e found it.
Monica Young, sandy Pierce. 2A.
Hat should we do?
-Should we ring the buzzer?
- No.
Let's just wait and see if somebody shows up.
You guys should go. l'm ruining your day.
-E don't mind being here, do we, carl?
- God, no. of course not.
Thanks, guys.
Mom almost caught us doing it this morning.
Are you kidding me?
L snuck into bed with carl.
Louis and l never did it in that house.
Hy not? You're allowed to.
L know, but Mom's always snooping around. l don't want her hearing me orgasm.
Do it in the morning, when she's so busy letting Dad have it in the kitchen.
L hope you're taking precautions with carl.
Oh, yeah. e use a condom and spermicidal gooey stuff.
Good.
Are you still trying to get pregnant?
Ell, we were, but we kind of stopped.
Louis feels he isn't ready yet.
Mm.
Can l have a cigarette?
Hy did l wear this skirt? l am so cold.
Don't let Mom hear you say that.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Okay, Mom, you win. l am freezing my ass off.
L think there's a coat in the back somewhere. lf you can find it in that mess.
Oh, thank you, carl.
E have been freezing to death in here.
Ah! hat is this? lt's herbal tea. l got it from the gourmet shop on the corner.
- It's, uh, jasmine blend.
- ooh!
So, carl, why don't you finish telling us the story of your novel?
Oh, l don't think everyone wants to hear that.
-Oh, come on.
-l'd like to. e all want to hear, carl.
Ell, when we left off, the man with the dog's head had become this sort of charismatic figure, boldly challenging the complacency of society.
He refers to our "pass the buck" political system as
-a corrupt role model for the individual,
- Yeah.
...so he starts telling people, "stop blaming each other for your own problems and look within yourselves for a way to effect change.
- Right.
- Everyone is really impressed.
People seem to have completely forgotten that he is essentially one-eighth German shorthaired Pointer.
Then... this group of far-right religious extremists
-plant a mail bomb in his office.
-oh, my God!
The bomb goes off in his hands.
He's rushed to the hospital.
- It's not clear whether he will make it.
- Hey, look.
-Hat should we do?
- Liza, go talk to him.
Okay, Jim, follow him.
Do you think they saw us?
They're gonna turn.
- You got it clear, Dad. Make a right.
- Right. Right.
Hello! Aah!
Go ahead.
Go on!
It's not red, it's amber.
Amber doesn't mean you have to stop.
Hat do you want me to do, drive up on the curb?
That was the world's shortest car chase.
- Eliza!
- Rita?
Mom!
- Liza, yell to him.
-l can't.
- Louis!
- Louder. Louis!
Louis!
Louis! Louis!
- Louis!
- Mother!
-Here's your father?
- Just cool it. He's right there.
Get back in the car. Get back in the car. e have to follow him.
Back in the car, you idiot!
- Rita!
- Jesus! Look out.
Give her some air. e need to elevate her feet. Liza, put them in your lap.
- Mama?
- Jo, keep talking to her.
E got to get her inside. someplace warm.
- Don't go into the light, Mom.
- Jo...
- Excuse me. Do you live here?
- Yeah. hy?
My girlfriend's mother has just fainted.
E need to get her inside, out of the cold.
They are good people. This is not a scam. can you help us, please?
-L guess l
- Thank you.
- Dad, we need the couch.
-sit down here, Rita. Are you all right?
Easy, easy.
- Do you have any bottled water?
-uh, yeah.
-Hat the hell is going on here?
- Dad, it's cool. Relax.
-Hat the hell is going on?
-shh!
My girlfriend's mother just passed out on the street. e wouldn't intrude
-ho the hell are you?
- Excuse me.
Ronnie, do you know any of these people?
- Relax, Dad, all right? Here.
-sit up and drink some water.
-Oh! oh, my God!
- How do you feel? Huh?
L-l'm dizzy. l...
Drink, drink. You need to rehydrate yourself, Rita. There you go.
- She passed out?
- Yeah.
Uh... oh, l'm sorry, you know?
You caught me by surprise.
You can't be too careful in the city, you know?
You never know what some nut's gonna try and pull off on you, right?
So we decided to stick around and see if she shows up.
L mean, there was nothing else for us to do.
Yeah, well, sure.
The book party is not till 6:30, right?
- Right.
-so you got hours to kill.
Exactly. so we decided to all sit in the car and wait and see who came out of the building.
And we were all freezing to death until carl here, this sweetheart, he runs out and he brings us back this really nice gourmet tea.
-Hat kind of tea was that?
-lt was a jasmine blend.
So we're waiting and waiting, and finally...
This young woman, the one in the photograph, comes out of the building.
- sandy.
- Mm-hmm.
-Ith Louis.
- No.
Ohh... ell, that's not definitive proof that something's going on.
Then they get into a cab, and we start following them.
But we got stuck at a traffic light.
- And then?
- And then my mom suddenly turns into esley snipes, jumps out of the car and chases after Louis's cab.
It was great. lt was great.
That's when l had my fainting spell!
As that something?
Oh, my God! oh!
And luckily carl stepped in, and he took care of everything.
That was very quick thinking, carl.
Ell, it's what anyone else would've done in that situation.
Oh, stop that. That's nonsense.
This one is so hard on himself.
L'm starving. hatever happened to lunch, Ronnie?
-L haven't had time to go to the store.
-hy don't all of you guys stay for lunch?
-Oh, no, no, Leon.
- No. l'm gonna go shopping.
You have already put yourself out for us enough as it is.
And l'd like to make it up to you for being, you know, a little confused when you came in.
-Come on. stay for lunch.
- That is so sweet of you.
L guess we're hungry.
Are you hungry, carl?
- L'm always hungry.
- Great.
Ronnie, why don't you run down to the store, and you get some cold cuts for all of us for lunch?
You know what?
L think maybe l'll make us all some nice, hot soup.
Huh? l'm gonna see what you have in the house.
Are you sure, Rita? Don't you think you should rest or something?
No, l'm fine, now that l'm in from the cold.
See, l'm no good in the cold. Thin blood.
For the love of God, don't let her make soup.
L'll get it.
You kids!
- All you have here is junk food!
- Hello?
Chips and soda.
That's all they eat, these kids.
Hello, Mom. How are you? Yeah.
- You could use a little, uh
-shh! shh!
No, no.
That's just one of the guys here that
They're over here, we're gonna play some basketball.
No. No, l haven't heard from him. um...
Yeah, of c sure, l will.
Yeah, of course. You know.
Right, look, let me, uh... l really got to go, 'cause we're just out the door, so let me...
Yeah. uh-huh.
Yeah, okay. No, l will. l...
Bye, bye.
Say, Rita, why don't you make a list and see what we need, and we'll send a couple kids down to the store.
Oh, that sounds swell, Leon.
Uh, is this romaine lettuce?
- Yeah.
- Ah. Lucky guess.
L can never tell.
It's really nice of you and your dad to help us out.
Oh, no problem.
You guys spend a lot of time together?
L don't really have much choice.
He's kind of taken over the place.
-Oh. oh!
-oh, boy.
Thanks. hat do you mean, he's taken over?
Ell, my mom and dad, they split up when l was in high school, he hasn't been so great about paying his alimony and child support.
L have two younger brothers who still live at home, and...
Anyway, uh, he's been so bad about paying his alimony that there's basically a subpoena out for his arrest, so, uh, l'm harboring a fugitive at the moment.
God, Leon. Kids.
L didn't give birth to my girls till later in life.
L had trouble conceiving.
Novenas, everything.
Eliza, l remember she was a breech birth.
Excruciating. You know what l mean?
And you. You, miss. Ha!
She was a change-of-life baby.
Ho knew? hat a shock.
Ronnie was sort of a difficult baby, but, uh, he grew up to be a real quiet kid.
- Real shy.
- That's not entirely true.
You remember when you were in the Boy scouts and you were elected to go door-to-door to sell raffies?
Do you remember how upset you were?
- Yes, l remember.
-so upset l had to go with him.
-L had to do all the talking.
- Mom went with me too.
You're not as shy now.
Shy or not,
Ronnie saved the day for us today.
He sure did, yeah.
He's a good kid.
L read somewhere the experts were saying that, you know, shyness should be discouraged in childhood because it could lead to antisocial behavior.
- L read it in a mag
- oh, please, Mom.
L'm not making this up. ell, l don't know.
L mean, you're not antisocial.
Sometimes l am.
E all are.
Sometimes.
You know, l've been pretty antisocial of late, but it's really great to have surprise guests here.
Uh, say, would anyone want some more wine or anything?
Thank you.
Ronnie, what do you do?
Um, l'm in my second year of business school, graduate business school at columbia.
Oh, that's good. very good.
You seem like a very nice young man,
Ronnie.
- And smart too.
- He's a real nice kid.
You know, l've been traveling a lot lately for the last couple of years, so l figured l'd come up here and spend some time and visit the kid, and, uh, we've been having fun.
Ah!
-Um, what do you do, Eliza?
-l teach fourth grade.
It's hard, but, uh, l really love the kids, so...
- Do you have any kids of your own?
- Not yet.
Oh, that's good, you know? l'm uh... could be messy, uh...
You know, uh...
-oh. oh, my God.
-hat? hat?
-L've got this excruciating pain.
-hat? hat?
Arthritis.
You want some aspirin or... l had bursitis. l used to be a tennis pro.
L had bursitis so bad in my shoulder l had to quit playing tennis.
This is worse.
This is my cross to bear. oh, God.
It's brutal, right?
You know, Rita, l know a shiatsu pressure-point thing for your fingers there, if you'd like.
- Really?
- Yeah. Here, let me show you.
You find the pressure points and then come up along the knuckles like this, see?
- Ah!
- Does that feel good?
It works. see that?
-Carl's plucking my nerves.
- How come?
The way he dotes on Mom is making me a little sick.
Yeah, well, Mom better chill.
She's starting to give me a little headache.
You want some more wine, Rita?
Oh, my God. l shouldn't.
-Come on.
- All right. Thank you.
Oh, my God. carl.
-So, um, what's next for you, Leon?
-l have a few options right now.
L have a friend of mine in Miami, Florida, you know, in south Beach.
He wants me to come down and manage his nightclub.
It's a real swanky place.
Magicians, singers.
So l'm just tossing around different options.
- Jo, you're a lovely young lady.
- Thank you so much.
- All the best to you.
-oh, great. Nice meeting you, Robert.
-Carl, good luck to you with your book.
- Thank you.
Rita, you stay out of the cold, you hear?
Oh, Leon, what a generous man.
- Jim, it's been a pleasure.
- Leon, you're the best.
Thank you. Eliza...
You have your family. They can help you.
- Your family.
- Thanks, Leon.
Asn't Leon a nice guy? salt of the earth, you know?
Yeah, but that telephone incident.
That was very odd.
Gave me the willies.
Oh, come on. l'm sure there was some reasonable explanation.
-It wasn't any of our business.
-oh, you're probably right, carl.
So, should l continue with my novel? oh, yes. so dog man is in the hospital because of the mail bomb.
Right, and there's this team of surgeons working around the clock, trying l'm sorry to interrupt.
Does this dog have a name?
Fido.
That was hostile.
L was kidding. l was kidding.
His name's Noah, like in the Bible.
So Noah survives the operation but loses his hands.
Ah. so he's a man with a dog's head and no hands.
Exactly.
A pointer who can't point.
Huh?
E're here.
Ho's going in?
L don't want to go in. l don't want to do this in front of Louis's coworkers.
Jo and l could see if he's there.
- You mind, Miss Malone?
- No, l'd love a mint julep right now.
Let's go. l'm so hungry.
L couldn't take Mother's soup.
It was disgusting.
This coat smells. This coat smells.
L feel like l'm turning into Grandpa, carl.
Ah, gross!
L hope Norman Mailer isn't here.
- Jo?
- Huh?
-Hat are you doing?
-l just want to look nice.
You really think
Norman Mailer will be here?
Yes, the book is a fiction, but l propose it is informed by my relationship with my stepfather.
He was sort of a cross between a Fred MacMurray and a Pol Pot.
Now, that is quite a polarity, and it was quite a challenge... e need to open another bottle of vodka.
It seems that you've put most of the last bottle in your mouth.
Thank you.
Oh, oh.
People coming in. People coming in.
Hi. l'm Aaron from cordelia Press.
And you are?
L'm Jo. l'm Jo. l'm Louis D'Amico sister-in-law.
-E're looking for Louis. ls he here yet?
-oh, no, he's not, but put your coats in there and then help yourself to a drink.
-L certainly am.
- Thanks.
- Louis isn't here yet.
- Louis isn't here yet.
L heard him.
- Do you want us to wait for him upstairs?
- All right, dear.
-She was a thief?
- Yeah.
But, you know, l'd like to see her again.
- Really?
- Yeah. l mean, you know, if she wouldn't have a second date with me, l'd like to, l don't know, have her arrested.
Aaron, l'd like you to perform a task that's vaguely associated with your job.
Excuse us.
Hi. Did l...
Are you Louis D'Amico's sister-in-law?
- Yes, yes.
-l thought, uh...
-l'm Jo.
-l'm Eddie. How are ya? l work with Louis.
Really? hat do you do?
Actually, cordelia Press is publishing my novel.
Ow, that's great. congratulations.
Are they doing a good job?
Ell, they're desperately trying to come up with a publicity campaign to make it se to the public.
It's kind of like trying to make salt se to a slug.
So was Aaron telling you about his little liaison with the criminal element?
God, yeah, he was.
L thought it was kind of weird.
Don't you think weird when people you don't know start talking about their sexual exploits?
It's just... You know?
-Can l ask you something?
-sure.
Hat do you think of Louis D'Amico?
L don't know. hat do you think about Louis D'Amico?
L don't know.
Carl, Eddie. Eddie, carl.
Eddie's having his novel published by Louis's company.
You are? ow, that's impressive.
L guess Jo told you l'm finishing up a novel myself.
No. Really?
Yeah, yeah. l hate to talk about it though.
-L know what you mean.
-l have to find a bathroom.
God, you have the smallest bladder on this planet.
Jeez.
- Jo. Jo.
-hat?
- You're not gonna believe who's here.
-ho?
- Nick. Nick oodman.
-ho?
Nick. The most important man in my life. l told you all about him.
You know, my writing teacher that semester l spent at cambridge.
L want you to meet him. uh, brilliant, brilliant writer.
No, wait. l'll get him back.
Ell, l'm just gonna do the book tour...
Nick!
Nick?
Nick?
Hi, it's carl from, uh, the... shit.
Nick! Nick!
Ait, Nick!
Nick! ait, Nick.
Hey, it's carl. carl Petrovich.
Carl thinks that democracy is the reason why the middle class is so mediocre, that it just naturally tends toward the middle, toward mediocrity.
-Hat is he, a communist?
- No, no.
He thinks that communism is totally unrealistic in the cravenness of human nature.
Then what does carl propose instead of a democracy?
He thinks we should live in an aristocracy.
- hat?
- Yeah.
Carl, l was just telling Eddie what we were talking about today about aristocracies.
-Oh, yeah?
-here's your teacher?
- Hmm?
-here's your teacher?
Oh, uh, he had to be somewhere.
He, uh, told me to give him a ring before he left town.
-So what were you guys talking about?
- Jo was saying that you, uh, think an aristocracy is preferable to a democracy.
Ell, if it were led by a-a cultured and enlightened ruling class, yes, l do.
L see. hat about the poor people?
- That's what l asked.
- They could work.
Ork has dignity, and there's value in work.
Ould the common folk like to give up the vote? oh, come on.
You don't really think the vote has any bearing on social change, do you?
Of course it doesn't.
Republican, Democrat, it doesn't matter.
They all think like managers.
As far as l'm concerned,
Bush and clinton are interchangeable.
They have no code of honor.
At least the aristocracy had a... a sense of, uh... you know, a code of honor.
L think you might be overestimating the ideals of aristocrats, carl.
-Oh, good point.
- And your take on politicians seems simplistically cynical, even to me.
L wouldn't say cynical.
Pragmatic, maybe. cynical seems...
Longing for a return of the Borgias hardly sounds pragmatic.
So what, we should just accept everything and not question the system like a like a bunch of sheep?
No, but it's ludicrous snobbery to think that the brilliant and cultured can be up here and the dumb workers down here but dignity all around.
L'm sorry. Look, l'm-l'm, uh, not really in the mood for a political argument right now.
But, carl, do you really think it makes no difference whether there's a Republican or Democrat in office?
L don't really think he needs any help arguing his side.
L was asking that question myself.
L was stating, like, my opinion and what l thought.
L'm sorry. Forget it. hoa, whoa.
Forget it, forget it. sorry.
It's me. l'm a little drunk. sorry.
But there's one thing.
There is a lot of mediocrity in the world, that's a given, but, uh, if you're a real writer, you have a choice.
You can whine about it or you can struggle against it.
That's where the best writing comes from struggling against your society, your conscience, your appetites.
Frankly, l don't know if what l feel will mean anything to an indifferent middle-class consumer society, because, you know, l... l don't feel like one of them.
Excuse me.
Everybody, l just wanted to make sure you got a chance to meet our guest of honor,
Amy corinne Fairbright-Lebow.
Thank you, chap.
Hi. um, l'm sort of nervous.
Um, thank you everyone for coming.
Uh, anyway, l must confess l find it odd to be experiencing such feelings of joy in association with a book that is principally a devastating account of spiritual asphyxiation.
So with that in mind, um, l'd like to read a selection of journal entries, um, from the year 1076.
Here the hell is that husband of yours?
E can't sit here and freeze to death.
Let's go find a restaurant, someplace warm.
E'll leave a note on the car for Jo.
Don't be stupid.
By the time we find a place and leave a note on the car, they'll be back down.
Hy didn't you think of this an hour ago?
Here the hell is he going?
-Hat, are you gonna leave me here?
-l'll be right back.
Tell your father to get back here! ill you hand me that bag?
That's the last thing.
But be careful. lt's aterford crystal.
- Here we go.
- Thanks.
- Hiya, Dad.
-oh, hi, kid.
This is my daughter, Eliza.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen, l hope you're not gonna leave any of this stuff unattended.
-Somebody might steal it.
-oh, listen, l'm leaving as soon as l can.
Actually, you could help me.
There's something upstairs that's very heavy l have to move.
L could use a couple of extra hands.
Honest to God, it would only take a minute.
-Sure!
- No, let me help you. He has a bad back.
- Ah, my back isn't so bad.
- You stay and watch the car. l'll help.
All right, but you better watch your back, especially with your occupation.
She's a human fly. climbs skyscrapers.
He's kidding.
Oh.
Ell, this'll only take a minute.
Follow me.
Dad, thanks for driving us around all day.
Sure, kid.
You coming?
You got another one.
It's not just the elevator.
The whole building smells like rat poison.
My mother died. My sister and l are, uh, cleaning out the apartment.
Oh, l'm sorry.
Ell, would've been so much easier if she'd bothered to write a will.
Hello.
This is Eliza. she's gonna help me move something.
Hello. l'm so sorry to hear about your mother.
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
She lasted much longer than any of the doctors thought she would.
-Hat is this?
-lt's the chevalier barometer.
Our mom worked as a maid in the Astoria Hotel, and Maurice chevalier gave her this.
-L wonder how much we can get for it.
- Doris, we can't sell this.
Hat's all this?
It's Mom's medication. l cleaned out the medicine cabinet.
Ell, let's split it up. okay.
This is ampicillin.
L could use some of that. l'm always getting sick in the winter.
Excuse me. can l use your telephone? l need to call my answering machine.
Ell, the plug's over there.
Just follow the cord. l have a small Tv. l would like one like Mom's.
Now, you've already got the stereo, and you've got all the records.
Ell, that's because you weren't interested in any of those things.
In other words, you should get whatever you want and l should get nothing.
You took extra pills. l'm gonna take this Tylenol with codeine.
No, you are not. e are splitting the Tylenol with codeine.
-L'm gonna take these sleeping pills.
- No. e'll split those too.
Hat do you need sleeping pills for?
Ell, it's very hard to sleep in the city.
All that noise?
You do not take sleeping pills because there's some noise in the city.
You take sleeping pills if you have a serious sleep disorder.
Okay. oh, my God. l've completely lost count.
L don't know if this is your pill or it's my pill.
You give me those.
Tylenol with codeine.
Amoxicillin.
-Oh, my God!
-valium. oh!
Doesn't she look just like carol Anne?
My God!
She was our favorite cousin.
She wore her hair like this.
L really have to go.
My dad is waiting for me downstairs.
Look, l need that young woman to help me move the television.
That's the only thing l want, so l think l should really have it.
- Then l want the silver.
- Fine.
My sister she wonders why l never come to visit her.
Isn't it obvious? Look at her?
It's depressing to be around somebody like that. she's like a child.
Ell, she's your sister.
So what? Just because she happens to be my sister?
She might as well be somebody l met in an elevator.
There's the elevator.
Look out!
-E need to back around.
- Look out!
L'm not carrying your weight here.
Ouch! l hurt my hand. can you get that button?
-Here the hell have you been?
-e caught a double feature.
- Ha, ha. Louis never showed.
-hat?
The book party is breaking up, and Louis didn't show.
Can you believe this? here the hell is he?
Maybe l should call the machine again.
Oh, why the hell not?
Shit. l left my bag inside the party.
-L'll go get it.
- No, l'll get it.
It's not a problem. l'll get the bag, Jo.
You don't have to do everything for everybody, carl.
L don't do everything for everybody.
You just take a very long time doing certain things.
Ell, l promise l won't take a very long time.
And she was se, you know, in a Ruben-esque kind of way, right?
And right off the bat, she starts talking to me about sex.
About screwing her roommate's boriend in the entay to her apartment building, seducing the cable guy...
Hey.
-Is this yours?
- Yeah. Thanks.
Uh, l'm glad l got to say good-bye.
Have you seen the view from the bedroom? lt's really worth seeing.
- No, l just have to
-come on. lt'll just take a second.
- There's no view.
- Yeah, whatever. l gotta go.
Yeah, l gotta go. l'm sorry.
M'kay.
- Found it.
- Great.
So, you been around the block, right?
Okay, good night.
Ell, um, do
Look in your address book, under T.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hi, honey. lt's e.
can youpick up? Hello?
Eliza?
Where are you?
Well, l calling to say this bookparty's going a little later than l thought,
and then chap wants e to coe out to dinner with the author.
l think l gonna be a little late.
ln fact, what l ight do is stayin chap's guest roo ifthis goes too late.
But, uh, l don't know. uh, lll callyou back in an hour or two.
okay? okay. Bye.
Do you want me to come with you?
No, l'll go alone.
Hello?
Yeah, coe on up!
The things that l used to do
Never do the no ore, baby
Yeah, the things that l used to do
Yeah, l ain't nevergonna do the
No ore
Are you sandy's friend? Have we met?
Did you go to vassar?
- No.
-oh. Do you take yoga on 10th?
- No.
- Do you want a drink? l'm drinking gin.
In fact, l wanted to fill the whole bathtub with gin, but the health-conscious contingent got here first and filled it with hummus.
Just kidding.
Here. Drink up.
There.
You seem a little bit nervous, jumpy.
Hat's the matter? some guy here you like?
There's a guy here l like. l like him a lot.
See that guy? e went out for three and a half years.
If he tries to pick you up, l say go for it.
He's a real stand-up gent.
And aully good in the sack too.
My only complaint with him is his tiny
"falling out of love" problem.
It's odd, but one might think that my seeing him here for the first time in, oh, roughly
11 months and 10 days, that might have something do do with my drinking more gin and tonics than a boat full of AsPs at a Hyannis Port regatta.
That's a really cute dress you're wearing. lt's really adorable.
Uh, so, do you know sandy?
- Hat?
- Do you know sand
- Do you know sandy?
-oh, no, no.
Um, l don't really know anybody here. l was meeting some friends ell, don't leave me.
L'm gonna call the machine.
L go to school in Michigan, but l definitely... l think l'm gonna be back here for christmas break,
'cause l really like New York.
L really enjoyed talking to you.
L like what you had to say.
L don't even know you. so l'm gonna go.
Roland called. He, uh...
He wants to borrow money again. Jesus.
-Ho were you talking to?
- Nobody.
L was standing right here. l saw you.
You were talking to someone.
Ho?
L was calling the machine.
No, you weren't. ords were coming out of your mouth.
You were having a conversation. ho were you talking to?
L was talking to the machine.
You were talking to our machine?
Hy are you lying?
L'm not.
Jo, why are you lying to me?
Oh, carl, God. lt's such a long day.
You called that guy, didn't you?
You purposefully left your purse so you could go back there and talk to him, didn't you?
-Hat the fuck are you doing?
- Don't yell at me!
- You called that fucker, didn't you?
- Don't yell at me!
Hy, Jo? hy-hy are you doing this?
Do you realize what you're doing when you lie to me?
Do you have any clue what trust is?
-Hat's going on?
- Go back to the car.
-Hat did you do?
- Go back to the car.
-L didn't do anything. Jesus christ!
- Yes, you did.
It's like the fucking lnquisition here!
God!
Don't you talk that way to me!
Leave me alone. Just leave me alone.
L don't know what's going on here, but you better wise up.
Carl is a good man, and he loves you.
-Oh, Mom
- This is no joke.
-Oh, please.
-carl will look after you.
-Save it, okay? save it.
-carl is a good person.
He is dedicated to you.
And if you screw this up by chasing after God knows what, you're a fool!
A fool! Just wise up!
You know, you don't know me, okay? so just leave me alone!
- You're an idiot!
- Jo, can l talk to you, please?
Go to the car!
No, l don't want to talk to you!
L'm sick of talking to you, l'm sick of listening to you, l'm sick of you!
-L'm sick of you!
- Good. Find someone else to be sick of.
-Carl, wait. Please, carl, please.
- No, it's no use.
Please. l'll talk to her, okay?
Carl, she's a foolish girl. she always has been.
No, actually she's not.
And she needs you.
She needs you, carl. Please don't go.
L know you love her.
-L have to find a bathroom.
-okay.
Look, so, carl, okay, l will talk to her, all right?
Yes.
You tell me what the hell is going on before you throw away the best thing
-that ever happened to you in your life.
- You have no right!
You have no right giving anybody advice, Mom.
Okay? You have no right.
You pushed...
You pushed Eliza to marry Louis.
- Now look what's happening, Mom!
-l what?
Look what's happening!
You don't know anything, Mom!
You know nothing, Mom! You know nothing!
Come back here! Now!
Hat are you doing standing there like a bull?
Hy don't you do something?
Hell, what can l do?
You are useless.
Useless!
L want you to just look over there and tell me, is he looking at me?
No, wait!
Is he looking at me? No, wait!
Or is he looking at the redhead with the big... okay, now look.
Is he looking at me?
No.
Look again.
Do you think he knows l'm here?
No, wait. Don't let him see you looking like that. You're staring.
-L don't think he is.
-okay, we need some more drinks, darling.
- Monica! Hi! How are you?
- Hi!
Here'd you go?
Do you know where sandy is?
Oh, l think sandy's on the roof.
Do you want to go up? Perfect.
They got lights and everything up there.
Do some dancing...
E can... dance!
Eliza!
Eliza, where are you going? here are you going?
Hat are you doing? hat are you doing in the city?
Hat are you doing?

No, don't smile.
<SYNC Start=316120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=317280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Be sad.
<SYNC Start=318280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Sadder.<br>Think of something awful.
<SYNC Start=321960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=327720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Excuse me...<br>the door was open.
<SYNC Start=770600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=772240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm sorry. I ran over
<SYNC Start=773520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=773760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> your dog.
<SYNC Start=774720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=777240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Rita. A German shepherd.
<SYNC Start=779640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=781200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's possible.
<SYNC Start=781840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=782760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She disappeared yesterday.
<SYNC Start=784240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=784640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She's in my car. Alive.
<SYNC Start=786560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=787520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l don't know what to do.
<SYNC Start=788960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=793400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Should I take her to a veterinarian?
<SYNC Start=796920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=798800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
As you wish.
<SYNC Start=799760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=802080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> lf l ran over your daughter,
<SYNC Start=803960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=805440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> would you be so indifferent?
<SYNC Start=807560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=808560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l have no daughter, Miss.
<SYNC Start=810440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=814560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Go away.
<SYNC Start=815600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=821800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Don't close the door.
<SYNC Start=822720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=875240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She's fine.<br>We stitched her up.
<SYNC Start=877440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=877680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Otherwise, she has a few bruises.
<SYNC Start=879400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=881280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She'll need some rest.
<SYNC Start=882960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=883480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She's pregnant.
<SYNC Start=884800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=886720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Will you take her<br>or leave her here?
<SYNC Start=888560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=889680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>

<SYNC Start=890640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=907880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=908480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>

Tell him something.
<SYNC Start=913160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=918280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you hear?<br>I have a dog.
<SYNC Start=919800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=920400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A dog. I ran her over.
<SYNC Start=923080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=926040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Michel, I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=927400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=927880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That wasn't funny.
<SYNC Start=929000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=929320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No, it wasn't.
<SYNC Start=930360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=930600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I knew it was a joke.<br>I could see you laughing.
<SYNC Start=933720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=934120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you remember how we met?
<SYNC Start=936040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=936280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I remember...
<SYNC Start=937280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=939600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
We're lucky<br>I stepped out during the break.
<SYNC Start=942640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=942880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's true.
<SYNC Start=943840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=945440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Valentine, return the dog.
<SYNC Start=946640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=946880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I tried.<br>The owner doesn't want it.
<SYNC Start=950360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=951120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Who is he?
<SYNC Start=952080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=953440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I hear an alarm.
<SYNC Start=955000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=958640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it's my car.
<SYNC Start=959560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=961800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Wait for me<br>to turn it off.
<SYNC Start=963400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=963640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm in a rush.
<SYNC Start=964680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=965240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I understand.
<SYNC Start=965720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=991360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Move.
<SYNC Start=992280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=992840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Move.
<SYNC Start=993840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1008680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
They prefer these.
<SYNC Start=1010360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1012240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
They'll use the slogan:<br>"A Breath of Life".
<SYNC Start=1016040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1017720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Which do you prefer?
<SYNC Start=1018920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1026760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>

Who?
<SYNC Start=1044080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Who are you thinking of?
<SYNC Start=1054880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1067120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Not you.
<SYNC Start=1068280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1119320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's a bad sign.
<SYNC Start=1120880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Who sent it?
<SYNC Start=1172000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Isn't that your brother?
<SYNC Start=1176760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1179520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Or someone who looks like him.
<SYNC Start=1181160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1181440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What a shame.<br>Does your family read this paper?
<SYNC Start=1184680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1186680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I don't know. Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1188240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1188440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Goodbye.
<SYNC Start=1189240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1218640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Can I speak to Marie, please?
<SYNC Start=1221640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1224800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's Valentine.<br>Will you see Marc soon?
<SYNC Start=1228040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1228320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Tonight, probably.
<SYNC Start=1229680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1231400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Tell him to call me<br>at any hour.
<SYNC Start=1233320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1242440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'II let you run around.
<SYNC Start=1244160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1245520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
But don't run away.
<SYNC Start=1247160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1248360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You promise?
<SYNC Start=1249160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1251920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Go on.
<SYNC Start=1252440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1285600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Excuse me.<br>My dog ran away.
<SYNC Start=1287800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1342880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Call her. She's yours.
<SYNC Start=1344960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1374280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
- Was it you?<br>- For the vet.
<SYNC Start=1376080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1376560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
- You found my address?<br>- That was easy.
<SYNC Start=1378680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1380920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You don't know the prices.
<SYNC Start=1382560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1384480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it cost 130 francs.
<SYNC Start=1386280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1387880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You sent me 600.
<SYNC Start=1389400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1399000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Wait. I'll get the change.
<SYNC Start=1400280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1404400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What about Rita?
<SYNC Start=1405520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1406200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She's a very intelligent dog.
<SYNC Start=1408600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1409400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Take her.
<SYNC Start=1410320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1411760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
-You don't want her?<br>- I want nothing.
<SYNC Start=1413280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1416120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Then stop breathing.
<SYNC Start=1418120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1419040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Good idea.
<SYNC Start=1419960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1475880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You don't breathe anymore?
<SYNC Start=1477240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1493080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
If you don't come,<br>you'll never see me again.
<SYNC Start=1496040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1496640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
But today is Sunday.
<SYNC Start=1498560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1498800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yesterday was Saturday<br>and we were together.
<SYNC Start=1502200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1502680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm sorry, Sir.<br>We're about to have lunch.
<SYNC Start=1506280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1507040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I ask one thing of you:<br>don't call me ''Sir''.
<SYNC Start=1509960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1510560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Talk to me like yesterday.<br>Call me Pierrot.
<SYNC Start=1513440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1514040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Call me ''my love''.<br>Say ''my love''...
<SYNC Start=1517040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1517440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Sir, let me change rooms.
<SYNC Start=1519720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1533400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Pierre, I'm alone now.
<SYNC Start=1534480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1534720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
So am l.
<SYNC Start=1535200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1536160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Far from you. I want you to come.<br>I can't be alone...
<SYNC Start=1540040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1542040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I saw you yesterday.<br>I miss you too.
<SYNC Start=1544520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1545120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Understand that.
<SYNC Start=1545640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1545880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I don't want to.<br>I'm thinking of you.
<SYNC Start=1548440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1549120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You're naked in front of the mirror.<br>But for someone else, not for me.
<SYNC Start=1553480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1554640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l want to kiss you.<br>l lean forward,
<SYNC Start=1556720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1557880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I touch your lips...
<SYNC Start=1559280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1559520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What are you doing?
<SYNC Start=1560560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1567440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm spying.
<SYNC Start=1568320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1568840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=1569320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1574760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm listening<br>to my neighbors' phone calls.
<SYNC Start=1577920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1578160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You cut it off<br>just as it was getting interesting.
<SYNC Start=1581480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1585600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You don't find it entertaining?
<SYNC Start=1587440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1588120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's disgusting.
<SYNC Start=1588960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1589200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=1589880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1590840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What's more, it's illegal.
<SYNC Start=1592520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1595640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Your 30 francs.
<SYNC Start=1596840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1602560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
One minute, Miss.
<SYNC Start=1604000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1609520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You're persuaded you are right.
<SYNC Start=1611920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1612480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=1613240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1614280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Then why
<SYNC Start=1615320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1615560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> don't you do anything?
<SYNC Start=1616680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1617440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=1618200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1620200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Can't I touch your scar,
<SYNC Start=1622240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1622680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> like yesterday?
<SYNC Start=1623560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1628680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Go see this man.
<SYNC Start=1630160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1631200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Tell him someone listens<br>to his conversations.
<SYNC Start=1634360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1635680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
While you're at it,<br>tell him
<SYNC Start=1637240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1637480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it's me.
<SYNC Start=1638400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1639720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I will.
<SYNC Start=1640640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1644200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's that house.
<SYNC Start=1645640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1653160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
May l see your husband?
<SYNC Start=1654240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1654480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He's upstairs on the phone.<br>Let me shut off the gas.
<SYNC Start=1658600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1662920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Come in, please.
<SYNC Start=1664320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1691040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Have a seat.
<SYNC Start=1692000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1692240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He'll be right down.
<SYNC Start=1693520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1693800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Caroline, don't play
<SYNC Start=1695240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1695480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> with the phone.<br>Daddy's talking.
<SYNC Start=1697360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1698600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=1699200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1699960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm at the wrong address.
<SYNC Start=1701080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1701320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
This is number 22.
<SYNC Start=1702800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1703040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm very sorry.
<SYNC Start=1704600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1704840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No problem.
<SYNC Start=1705960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1706960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Have a nice day.
<SYNC Start=1707920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1746040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Goodbye.
<SYNC Start=1746680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1746920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll call you later.
<SYNC Start=1748520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1760920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You lost this.
<SYNC Start=1762280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1776040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
So? Did you tell him?
<SYNC Start=1778920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1785840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Would you like<br>something to drink?
<SYNC Start=1787680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1787920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No, l wouldn't.
<SYNC Start=1789240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1792800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I came back...
<SYNC Start=1793960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1795320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I came back to ask you something.
<SYNC Start=1797560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1798880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Don't do this any more.
<SYNC Start=1800360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1802560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I've done it all my life.
<SYNC Start=1804360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1821480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What were you?
<SYNC Start=1822720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1823360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A cop?
<SYNC Start=1824200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1825120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Worse. A judge.
<SYNC Start=1826760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1835080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A judge?
<SYNC Start=1835920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1836160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You've never seen one<br>for real?
<SYNC Start=1837960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1847200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Would you like to try?<br>It makes...
<SYNC Start=1849880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1850120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> a lovely sound.
<SYNC Start=1851280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1857280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l don't know whether l was<br>on the good or the bad side.
<SYNC Start=1860280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1861760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Here, at least, I know<br>where the truth is.
<SYNC Start=1866040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1867000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
My point of view is better<br>than in a courtroom.
<SYNC Start=1869840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1870280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=1870880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1872960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Everyone deserves a private life.
<SYNC Start=1874720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1875400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Of course.
<SYNC Start=1876640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1879200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why did you stop short?<br>Why didn't you tell him?
<SYNC Start=1882920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1886240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Because he has a sweet wife,
<SYNC Start=1888480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1889160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> devoted to him?
<SYNC Start=1890240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1891200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
And a little daughter who loves him?<br>So you couldn't.
<SYNC Start=1895600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1896960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you feel remorse...
<SYNC Start=1899280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1899520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> or were you afraid to do harm?
<SYNC Start=1901840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1902680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe both.
<SYNC Start=1903960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1907160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Let me tell you.
<SYNC Start=1908640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1909520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It matters little<br>whether I spy or you tell them.
<SYNC Start=1913000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1914480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Sooner or later,
<SYNC Start=1915840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1916520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> he'll jump out a window,
<SYNC Start=1918240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1919480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> or she'll find out everything.
<SYNC Start=1922080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1923280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Someone will tell their daughter<br>and it will be living hell.
<SYNC Start=1927760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1930880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What can we do about it?
<SYNC Start=1932480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1936960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why are you so quiet?
<SYNC Start=1938320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1940240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Does this remind you of something?
<SYNC Start=1941920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1942160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
-Yes.<br>-What?
<SYNC Start=1943720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1944200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Say it.
<SYNC Start=1945160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1948560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A boy I know.
<SYNC Start=1949720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1949960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A boy you know who...
<SYNC Start=1951760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1954240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> found out his mother was a whore?
<SYNC Start=1956200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1959720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Who learned...
<SYNC Start=1961000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1962880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> he's not his father's son.
<SYNC Start=1964600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1965880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He was fifteen.
<SYNC Start=1967240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1970880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That man's daughter...
<SYNC Start=1972920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1975920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> she knows too.
<SYNC Start=1977360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1978440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Stay a minute.
<SYNC Start=1979800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1984800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=1985760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1988360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The light is beautiful.
<SYNC Start=1990040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1999800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2000040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm driving to Turin tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=2002280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2002520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I checked. The weather<br>will be fine to Chamonix.
<SYNC Start=2005360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2005600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
From Chamonix to the tunnel,<br>it may snow.
<SYNC Start=2008760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2009000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
And after the tunnel...<br>one minute...
<SYNC Start=2011680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2011920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l know the weather all over Europe.
<SYNC Start=2014520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2015320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Up to Turin,<br>the weather will be fine.
<SYNC Start=2016760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2017000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Leave early to avoid the snow.
<SYNC Start=2019080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2019320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
This service is a great idea.
<SYNC Start=2021040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2021280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Thank you. Goodbye.

Personal weather reports.
<SYNC Start=2038280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2040400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it's me.
<SYNC Start=2041360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2042680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you get any sleep?
<SYNC Start=2043760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2044000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A little.
<SYNC Start=2044920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2045520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I didn't tell you.<br>By telephone it may be easier.
<SYNC Start=2049400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2049840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it was really great.
<SYNC Start=2051360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2052320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
We'd never made love so well,<br>so long.
<SYNC Start=2055240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2056200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
We learned something.<br>Me from you. You from me.
<SYNC Start=2060000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2060800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
When l woke up, you were<br>still sleeping. Like a child.
<SYNC Start=2064240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2064480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm older than you.
<SYNC Start=2065520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2065800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
- One year!<br>- No, two.
<SYNC Start=2067680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2067920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Okay. Two. When I saw you, l got<br>scared. What is this leading to?
<SYNC Start=2073000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2073920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You sound a little down.
<SYNC Start=2075520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2076440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Are you nervous<br>about your exams?
<SYNC Start=2077760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

About what I'm going to do.<br>Will it be enough for you?
<SYNC Start=2081400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2081640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why not go bowling?
<SYNC Start=2082480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2083520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I opened all my books.
<SYNC Start=2085200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2085800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe.<br>Do you have a coin?
<SYNC Start=2087280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2087520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=2088280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2088520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Flip lt. Tails is bowling.<br>Heads is Penal Code.
<SYNC Start=2092320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2097520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Tails. Bowling.
<SYNC Start=2099000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2099880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll work for an hour,<br>then I'll call you.
<SYNC Start=2101560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2101840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Or I will.
<SYNC Start=2102720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2102960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll wait. lf l go out,
<SYNC Start=2104760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2105000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's just to buy cigarettes.
<SYNC Start=2107040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2113360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You didn't listen?
<SYNC Start=2114920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2118520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What a shame. It was romantic.
<SYNC Start=2121360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2122640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I heard the beginning.
<SYNC Start=2124040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2124960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
They're in love.
<SYNC Start=2126040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2128120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=2128720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2130680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He hasn't met the right woman yet.
<SYNC Start=2133240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2134560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
How do you know?
<SYNC Start=2135720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2136720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l watch them from my window.
<SYNC Start=2139200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2143520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You think I'm a bastard?
<SYNC Start=2144960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2145200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=2146000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2146480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Come look.
<SYNC Start=2147560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2151000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He bought a telephone in Japan<br>that uses another wavelength.
<SYNC Start=2155400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2157160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
My radio can't pick it up.<br>Too bad.
<SYNC Start=2160560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2162280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I think he's responsible for most<br>of the heroin trade in Geneva.
<SYNC Start=2166440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2167640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
We have nothing on him.
<SYNC Start=2169000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2170200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He never takes risks.
<SYNC Start=2171720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2177680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you like him?
<SYNC Start=2178840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2179120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Very much.
<SYNC Start=2179840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2183280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'II call him.
<SYNC Start=2184160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2185640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You have his phone number?
<SYNC Start=2187480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2212840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You deserve to die.
<SYNC Start=2213880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2231920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What did l do?
<SYNC Start=2232640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2234320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Here's his phone number.
<SYNC Start=2236000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2236640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
If you feel like saying<br>mean things to him, don't hesitate.
<SYNC Start=2240200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2250960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
At 10 o'clock, l turned off<br>the lights. I couldn't seep.
<SYNC Start=2254360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2254560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Next program.<br>Not very interesting.
<SYNC Start=2256840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2257200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I kept tossing and turning.<br>It kept hurting.
<SYNC Start=2260480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2261160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it still does.
<SYNC Start=2262880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2263840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I haven't done the errands.
<SYNC Start=2265400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2266560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm sorry, mother.
<SYNC Start=2267680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2267920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I have no milk or bread.
<SYNC Start=2269520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2269800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I bought you some.<br>I put it in the freezer.
<SYNC Start=2272920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2273960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I ate it all.
<SYNC Start=2274960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2275200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You didn't eat 7 loaves
<SYNC Start=2277160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2277520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> in #4##days.<br>I'm sick##of##this#.
<SYNC Start=2279480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2281960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Go do her errands.
<SYNC Start=2283800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2285240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe you'd feel better.
<SYNC Start=2286720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2293520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe she's the one
<SYNC Start=2294320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2294520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> who'd feel better.
<SYNC Start=2295760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2296520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why did you pick up Rita?
<SYNC Start=2298560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2300200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Because I'd run over her.
<SYNC Start=2301800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2302400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She was bleeding.
<SYNC Start=2303920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2305000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Otherwise,<br>you'd have felt guilty.
<SYNC Start=2306640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2307720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You'd have dreamt of a dog<br>with a crushed skull.
<SYNC Start=2311200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2312920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=2313480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2314200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
So who did you do it for?
<SYNC Start=2316000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2321680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Don't bother<br>doing that Lady's errands.
<SYNC Start=2324360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2324560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She has everything she needs.
<SYNC Start=2326040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2326720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She wants to see her daughter.
<SYNC Start=2328840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2330040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She already came 5 times,
<SYNC Start=2331720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2331960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> when her mother<br>faked a heart attack.
<SYNC Start=2334440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2336680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
After she dies,<br>I'II have to call the daughter.
<SYNC Start=2340280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2342280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She doesn't believe her any more.
<SYNC Start=2343760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2348200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You're mistaken.
<SYNC Start=2349320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2350520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
About what?
<SYNC Start=2351640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2352760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
About everything.
<SYNC Start=2353760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2356360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Everything.
<SYNC Start=2357160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2363000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
People aren't bad.
<SYNC Start=2363840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2364200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's not true.
<SYNC Start=2365280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2367000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=2367760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2368320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
They may be weak sometimes...
<SYNC Start=2369560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2371000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The boy who learned<br>his father wasn't his father...
<SYNC Start=2374560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2374840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> your boyfriend or your brother?
<SYNC Start=2376680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2379440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
My brother.
<SYNC Start=2380320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2380520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
How old is he?
<SYNC Start=2381840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2384240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
<SYNC Start=2385000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2385240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
How long<br>has he been shooting up?
<SYNC Start=2387680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2390520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
How do you know?
<SYNC Start=2391560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2391840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it wasn't hard to guess.
<SYNC Start=2393680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2400280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I can only feel pity for you.
<SYNC Start=2402840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2410760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe you don't know.
<SYNC Start=2411960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2412320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Your dog is pregnant.
<SYNC Start=2413800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2550120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Hello, darling.
<SYNC Start=2551480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Mom, did Marc come?
<SYNC Start=2553280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2553520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Two days ago. With his girlfriend.<br>Do you know her?
<SYNC Start=2556440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2556680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes. Marie.
<SYNC Start=2557680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2557920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
We're all together.<br>They're watching TV.
<SYNC Start=2560560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2561480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm sorry<br>l can't be there.
<SYNC Start=2562560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2562840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Too bad.<br>It's like old times.
<SYNC Start=2564840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2565040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Your brother's a good boy.
<SYNC Start=2566640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2566880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Can l talk to him?
<SYNC Start=2567960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2568200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Marci<br>He's coming.
<SYNC Start=2569640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2569880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Call me, Mom.<br>I love you.
<SYNC Start=2571440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2572000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Hi, Valentine.
<SYNC Start=2572560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2572840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Thanks for going there.
<SYNC Start=2574920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2575160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
We're leaving tomorrow.<br>I can't stand it.
<SYNC Start=2577720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2579560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Mom didn't see the paper?
<SYNC Start=2580840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2581040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I don't think so.<br>She'd never believe it...
<SYNC Start=2583640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2585240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You're right.<br>You should go home.
<SYNC Start=2586640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2586880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Bye.
<SYNC Start=2587800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Did you see the picture?
<SYNC Start=2601200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2601440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The picture?
<SYNC Start=2602360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2603840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Is that you, Jacques?
<SYNC Start=2604640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2604880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Isn't it amazing?<br>You didn't see it?
<SYNC Start=2607120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2608800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I forgot.<br>I've had a hard day.
<SYNC Start=2610200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2610440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Come meet us.<br>it'll relax you.
<SYNC Start=2612400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2612640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Where?
<SYNC Start=2613240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2618680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Not bad!
<SYNC Start=2619680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2817760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm sorry to bother you...
<SYNC Start=2819800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2820040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Someone played a stupid prank.<br>I can't get in.
<SYNC Start=2822360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2825680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Those kids...
<SYNC Start=2826360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2826600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Turks. Always trouble.
<SYNC Start=2828560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2829000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l don't know.<br>They stuck chewing gum in my lock.
<SYNC Start=2832520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2833080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Tweezers.
<SYNC Start=2834280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2844760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's me.
<SYNC Start=2845440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2845680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Michel...
<SYNC Start=2846640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2846880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I just called.<br>There was no answer.
<SYNC Start=2848720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2849800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Someone stuck chewing gum<br>in my lock.
<SYNC Start=2852680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2852920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I heard the phone.
<SYNC Start=2854200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2854440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Chewing gum?
<SYNC Start=2855200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2857440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I did an ad for chewing gum.<br>That must be why.
<SYNC Start=2860400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2861320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I told you not to.<br>They take advantage of you.
<SYNC Start=2863760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2865960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Forget lt.
<SYNC Start=2867120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2867960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
There was no answering machine.
<SYNC Start=2869360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2873560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
All l want is peace.
<SYNC Start=2874960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2876520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A life of peace and quiet.
<SYNC Start=2878000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2878240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Life won't be peaceful with me.
<SYNC Start=2880560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2883160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you meet someone?
<SYNC Start=2884800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2885280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No. I'm waiting for you.
<SYNC Start=2887560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2888040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why didn't you answer before?
<SYNC Start=2890520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2890760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I told you.<br>I couldn't get inside.
<SYNC Start=2893360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2893600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I understand.
<SYNC Start=2894640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2897560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
How are you?
<SYNC Start=2898760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2899000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm going to Hungary next week.
<SYNC Start=2900960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2902320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What are you doing?
<SYNC Start=2903600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2904040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm going to bed.
<SYNC Start=2904800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2905040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Go ahead
<SYNC Start=2905880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2906920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Go on..
<SYNC Start=2908000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2910800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Are you there?
<SYNC Start=2911920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2913520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Michel, are you there?
<SYNC Start=2914880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2920280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's starting again...
<SYNC Start=2921600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2944760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Are you asleep?
<SYNC Start=2945720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2946320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No, I'm not.
<SYNC Start=2947440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2947680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Get into bed.
<SYNC Start=2948920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2951000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Are you in bed?
<SYNC Start=2952040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2952440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm taking a shower.<br>I was getting undressed.
<SYNC Start=2954480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2954720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No one is helping you?
<SYNC Start=2956160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2960560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Valentine, are you there?
<SYNC Start=2962120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2963000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No. Goodnight.
<SYNC Start=2964040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2978200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I knew you'd make it.
<SYNC Start=2980160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2981600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did they ask the question?
<SYNC Start=2983040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2983400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
From the book<br>you dropped in the street.
<SYNC Start=2986440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3017440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You don't Like it?
<SYNC Start=3018760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3019720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes. Very much.
<SYNC Start=3020800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3124600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3125200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
- Did I pronounce it right?<br>- Yes.
<SYNC Start=3126880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3128760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
This one?
<SYNC Start=3129800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3132400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> just sold the last one.
<SYNC Start=3134120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3136240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll have others this afternoon.<br>l can set one aside.
<SYNC Start=3139520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3150120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Whose paper is this?
<SYNC Start=3151600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3151880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yours.
<SYNC Start=3152960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3185800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I came...
<SYNC Start=3186520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3188200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I saw the newspaper...
<SYNC Start=3189800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3190040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I want you to know<br>I didn't tell a soul.
<SYNC Start=3192000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3192240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I know.
<SYNC Start=3193520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3194360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No one. Not the police. No one.
<SYNC Start=3197160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3197440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I know.
<SYNC Start=3198560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3201960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l know who it was.
<SYNC Start=3203200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3204840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Who?
<SYNC Start=3205800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3207040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It was me.
<SYNC Start=3208280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3210080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You asked me to.
<SYNC Start=3211840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3212840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Won't you come in?
<SYNC Start=3214200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3215840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Let me show you something.
<SYNC Start=3217560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3236280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
One, two, three, four, five, six.
<SYNC Start=3240040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3241040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Seven?
<SYNC Start=3241680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3242760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Seven.
<SYNC Start=3243760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3245440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Won't you have some pear brandy?
<SYNC Start=3248000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3255560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I've had it for ages,<br>but I've never had an occasion.
<SYNC Start=3258560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3274280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
To my health.
<SYNC Start=3275440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3281560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why did you do it?
<SYNC Start=3283240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3283920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why did I turn myself in?
<SYNC Start=3285760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3286200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=3287040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3289440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
To see what you'd do<br>once you saw it in your paper.
<SYNC Start=3292560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3294280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You thought
<SYNC Start=3294960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3295200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I would come?
<SYNC Start=3296040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3296280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
After our last conversation,<br>I thought so.
<SYNC Start=3298960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3300440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=3301760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3309920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you expect something<br>from me?
<SYNC Start=3311600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3311840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=3312800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3315680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Before you left,<br>you mentioned
<SYNC Start=3317920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3318160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> pity.
<SYNC Start=3319120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3320600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Afterwards, I realized<br>it was disgust.
<SYNC Start=3322680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3334760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Will you sit down for a moment?
<SYNC Start=3336760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3345240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Will you smile for me?
<SYNC Start=3346320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3353640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The day you left,
<SYNC Start=3355560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3355800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> you cried.
<SYNC Start=3356880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3357360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I cried.
<SYNC Start=3358320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3361880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
And I shut off my radio.
<SYNC Start=3363720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3365760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I sat down at my desk.
<SYNC Start=3367600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3368600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The fountain pen I'd used<br>all my life was out of ink,
<SYNC Start=3372440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3372680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> so I took a pencil
<SYNC Start=3374160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3374800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> and wrote letters to my neighbors<br>and to the police.
<SYNC Start=3377680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3379160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I mailed them that evening.
<SYNC Start=3380720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3381400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
While you were sleeping soundly.
<SYNC Start=3383280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3383880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I wasn't sleeping.
<SYNC Start=3385440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3387080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I had gone bowling.
<SYNC Start=3387800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3390800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you remember<br>that couple's conversation?
<SYNC Start=3393480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3393760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The boy and the girl?
<SYNC Start=3395240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3397320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I remember.
<SYNC Start=3398520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3399240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
They wanted to go too.
<SYNC Start=3400560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3400800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That same evening.
<SYNC Start=3402200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3403160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe you were<br>right next to them.
<SYNC Start=3405400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3408200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe.
<SYNC Start=3409280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3412360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You didn't like her.
<SYNC Start=3413840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3416800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's almost over.<br>I was right.
<SYNC Start=3418440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3422440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You seem happy about it.
<SYNC Start=3424480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3430880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you provoke it?
<SYNC Start=3432760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3441080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes or no?
<SYNC Start=3442200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3445080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Because of my eavesdropping<br>and my trial,
<SYNC Start=3448080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3448640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> the girl met
<SYNC Start=3449720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3449960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> another man.
<SYNC Start=3451280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3481840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Good day.
<SYNC Start=3483040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3486560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Since then, she's been alone.
<SYNC Start=3488400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3489280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I asked my brother<br>to go see her.
<SYNC Start=3491480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3492080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He stayed three days.
<SYNC Start=3494000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3498080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> in one week<br>I'm going to England.
<SYNC Start=3500840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3501160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm abandoning my mother<br>and my brother.
<SYNC Start=3503040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3503280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Every day he gets a little worse.
<SYNC Start=3505440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3506280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I shouldn't leave.
<SYNC Start=3507720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3507960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Leave. It's your destiny.
<SYNC Start=3510560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3511080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You can't live your brother's life
<SYNC Start=3512840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3513080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> for him.
<SYNC Start=3514200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3520160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I love him.
<SYNC Start=3521360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3523840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
If only l could help.
<SYNC Start=3525480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3526160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You can.
<SYNC Start=3527240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3527720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Be.
<SYNC Start=3528720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3529800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What do you mean?
<SYNC Start=3531280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3532200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's all: be.
<SYNC Start=3534600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3539080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you like flying?
<SYNC Start=3541240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3541480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Then take the ferry.
<SYNC Start=3543040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3544640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I've never taken one.
<SYNC Start=3546320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3546600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's less expensive and healthier.
<SYNC Start=3549040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3549280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's a good idea.
<SYNC Start=3550600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3559880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you like it?
<SYNC Start=3561120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3562480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Today is my birthday.
<SYNC Start=3564360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3564720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I didn't know.
<SYNC Start=3566000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3569000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
35 years ago today,<br>at about the same time, 5 o'clock,
<SYNC Start=3573200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3574200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I acquitted a man. A sailor.
<SYNC Start=3576240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3578080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
One of my first big cases.<br>it was a tough time in my life.
<SYNC Start=3582040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3584320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I have since realized<br>I made a mistake.
<SYNC Start=3587560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3589080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He was guilty.
<SYNC Start=3590720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3595600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm all out of bulbs.
<SYNC Start=3597360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3625360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What happened to him?
<SYNC Start=3626800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3627920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I did my own investigation.
<SYNC Start=3629720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3630440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He's married with three children.
<SYNC Start=3633480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3633880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A grandson.
<SYNC Start=3635920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3637240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He is living in peace.
<SYNC Start=3638480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3641000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
So you did what was necessary.
<SYNC Start=3643240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3647000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
And you did it well.
<SYNC Start=3648480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3654440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Don't you understand?
<SYNC Start=3656040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3658120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You saved him.
<SYNC Start=3659400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3660840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Perhaps.
<SYNC Start=3662200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3663120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
But how many others<br>could l have acquitted? Even guilty?
<SYNC Start=3666640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3668600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Deciding what is true and what isn't<br>now seems to me
<SYNC Start=3672880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3674080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> a lack of modesty.
<SYNC Start=3676000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3678120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Vanity?
<SYNC Start=3679080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3680880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Vanity.
<SYNC Start=3682000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3691760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Can l have a drop?
<SYNC Start=3693280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3703480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
To you!
<SYNC Start=3704560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3708960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
If l had to go to court...
<SYNC Start=3710720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3712200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> are there still judges like you?
<SYNC Start=3714800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3716000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You won't go to court.
<SYNC Start=3717680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3718800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Justice doesn't deal<br>with the innocent.
<SYNC Start=3721160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3724080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
See that?
<SYNC Start=3725400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3725880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's the sixth window<br>they've broken.
<SYNC Start=3728080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3728320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The wavelength has been changed.<br>I can no longer eavesdrop.
<SYNC Start=3732280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3734560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Where is the broom?
<SYNC Start=3736000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3736240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
In the kitchen closet.
<SYNC Start=3738080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3759160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Put the stone<br>on the piano.
<SYNC Start=3761160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3779280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You're not afraid?
<SYNC Start=3780600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3783240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I wonder what I'd do<br>in their place.
<SYNC Start=3785880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3787840><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The same thing.
<SYNC Start=3789080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3790600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You'd throw stones?
<SYNC Start=3792280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3792680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> in their place? Of course.
<SYNC Start=3795400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3796440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
And that goes<br>for everyone judged.
<SYNC Start=3798760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3799160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Given their lives,<br>I would steal,
<SYNC Start=3801800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3802040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'd kill, I'd lie.<br>Of course I would.
<SYNC Start=3804760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3808320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
ALL that because I wasn't
<SYNC Start=3810000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3810240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> in their shoes, but mine.
<SYNC Start=3811800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3817280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> is there someone you love?
<SYNC Start=3819040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3825520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Have you ever loved?
<SYNC Start=3827240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3834520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yesterday l dreamt...
<SYNC Start=3835880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3838920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I dreamt of you.
<SYNC Start=3840280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3843880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You were 40 or 50 years old,
<SYNC Start=3846160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3848200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> and you were happy.
<SYNC Start=3849760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3851800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do your dreams come true?
<SYNC Start=3853920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3856920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's been years<br>since I dreamt something nice.
<SYNC Start=3859800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3906600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Stay there!
<SYNC Start=3907800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4070080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I bought a ticket<br>for the ferry.
<SYNC Start=4071800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4072040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I arrive in England<br>next Wednesday.
<SYNC Start=4075320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4079040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
At 7:30 a.m.
<SYNC Start=4080760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4081000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why the ferry?
<SYNC Start=4082280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4083560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
So I can visit my mother<br>near Calais.
<SYNC Start=4086160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4087080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll meet you at 8:00.
<SYNC Start=4089960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4091000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm happy you're coming.
<SYNC Start=4092480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4094160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Michel, tell me...
<SYNC Start=4095400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4096760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> do you love me?
<SYNC Start=4097680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4097920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I think so.
<SYNC Start=4099000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4100680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You love me<br>or you think so?
<SYNC Start=4102200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4102440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's the same thing.

<SYNC Start=4248720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Auguste!

Personal weather reports.
<SYNC Start=4285720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4286000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I've tried calling<br>for a few days.
<SYNC Start=4288400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4288640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I was sick. I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=4290120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4290360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What will the weather be<br>on the English Channel next week?
<SYNC Start=4293560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4293760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Wonderful. Sunny, a slight breeze,<br>chilly in the morning.
<SYNC Start=4297120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4297360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why are you laughing?
<SYNC Start=4298640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4298880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> l intend to go there.<br>Even farther.
<SYNC Start=4301680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4301920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
For your work?
<SYNC Start=4303000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4303240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No, for pleasure. On a yacht.
<SYNC Start=4305680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4305920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It's a nice sail.
<SYNC Start=4307160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4307400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes, very.
<SYNC Start=4308560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4308760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You'll be closing?
<SYNC Start=4309880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4310120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll have to.
<SYNC Start=4311440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4311680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's too bad.<br>It was a good idea. Goodbye.
<SYNC Start=4314000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4350640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
We told you<br>not to smile!
<SYNC Start=4352960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4354040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Be serious!
<SYNC Start=4355240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4356680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Can you send an invitation<br>to this address?
<SYNC Start=4359760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4360040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Just one person?
<SYNC Start=4361200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4525520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Are you okay?
<SYNC Start=4526600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4528040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
- So long.<br>- Have a good time.
<SYNC Start=4529080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4537320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
There's no make-up remover?
<SYNC Start=4538640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4538880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Here.
<SYNC Start=4539720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4552160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Everyone noticed
<SYNC Start=4553080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4553320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> that guy.
<SYNC Start=4554280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4555040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
During the entire show<br>I kept staring at him.
<SYNC Start=4558400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4582600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You came.
<SYNC Start=4583960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4585280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You knew the invitation<br>came from me?
<SYNC Start=4587160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4587400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'd hoped so.
<SYNC Start=4588560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4589560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you look for me?
<SYNC Start=4591040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4591880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
During the entire show.
<SYNC Start=4593520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4596880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm leaving tomorrow.<br>I wanted to say goodbye.
<SYNC Start=4599080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4600440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Goodbye.
<SYNC Start=4601400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4604200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'd like you<br>to tell me in detail
<SYNC Start=4606720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4607120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> the dream you had.
<SYNC Start=4608680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4611240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You were 50 years old
<SYNC Start=4613000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4613800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> and you were happy.
<SYNC Start=4615320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4616720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> in this dream...
<SYNC Start=4618000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4619880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> was there someone else?
<SYNC Start=4621680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4622800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
There was.
<SYNC Start=4623920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4625720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Who?
<SYNC Start=4626680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4631040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You woke up
<SYNC Start=4632560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4633360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> and you smiled at someone<br>next to you.
<SYNC Start=4635680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4636640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I don't know who.
<SYNC Start=4638000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4639680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's what will happen?
<SYNC Start=4641360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4643040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> in 20 or 25 years?
<SYNC Start=4644480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4645080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=4645960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4651440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What else do you know?
<SYNC Start=4653280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4655520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Who are you?
<SYNC Start=4656080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4657800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A retired judge.
<SYNC Start=4659280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4661440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I feel something important<br>is happening around me.
<SYNC Start=4664280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4666000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
And it scares me.
<SYNC Start=4667280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4678400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> is that better?
<SYNC Start=4679480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4683240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I used to come here often.
<SYNC Start=4684520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4686440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Where did you usually sit?
<SYNC Start=4688000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4689360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Where l sat today.
<SYNC Start=4690680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4692240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
That's why you couldn't see me.
<SYNC Start=4694280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4700040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
One day,<br>during the intermission,
<SYNC Start=4702040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4702800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> the elastic holding my books broke.
<SYNC Start=4705200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4706800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
One of them,
<SYNC Start=4707360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4707600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> a big one,<br>fell down...
<SYNC Start=4710480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4711280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> somewhere around here.
<SYNC Start=4712880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4714880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it was just before my exams.<br>I ran down immediately.
<SYNC Start=4718400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4718960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The book had opened to a certain<br>page. l read a few sentences.
<SYNC Start=4722160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4722880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it was the question they asked<br>during my exam.
<SYNC Start=4725520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4726680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Getting out of the house<br>did you good.
<SYNC Start=4729000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4730880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I had to recharge the battery.
<SYNC Start=4732400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4733320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it was dead.
<SYNC Start=4734400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4737160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The storm.
<SYNC Start=4738120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4766880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Lousy coffee.
<SYNC Start=4768400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4770680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I was wondering
<SYNC Start=4772000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4773160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> why you mentioned that sailor.
<SYNC Start=4774680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4775760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you know why?
<SYNC Start=4777160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4780520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=4781440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4789440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Because
<SYNC Start=4790800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4793000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> you didn't want to tell me<br>something more important.
<SYNC Start=4795920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4800000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
About the woman<br>that you loved.
<SYNC Start=4802720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4806960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She betrayed you.
<SYNC Start=4808240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4812160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She betrayed you,
<SYNC Start=4813800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4815160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> and you never understood why.
<SYNC Start=4817320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4821200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
And you kept on loving her.
<SYNC Start=4822880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4825560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
How do you know all this?
<SYNC Start=4827280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4832720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it wasn't hard to guess.
<SYNC Start=4834720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4837440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
What was she Like?
<SYNC Start=4838680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4840920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She graduated<br>two years before me.
<SYNC Start=4843160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4847560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
She was blond,
<SYNC Start=4849360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4850080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> delicate,
<SYNC Start=4851560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4852800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> radiant, with a long neck.
<SYNC Start=4855720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4858680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Her clothing and her furniture<br>were all light-colored.
<SYNC Start=4862040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4863320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
In the foyer there was a mirror<br>in a white frame.
<SYNC Start=4866920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4869320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> it was in that mirror,
<SYNC Start=4870880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4871360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> one night,
<SYNC Start=4872800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4873800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> that I saw her white Legs spread,
<SYNC Start=4875680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4878360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> with a man between them.
<SYNC Start=4880320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4884800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=4885760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4886680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> did that happen?
<SYNC Start=4888440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4889160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you know?
<SYNC Start=4890440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4891080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
This man,<br>whose name was Hugo Holbling,
<SYNC Start=4895000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4898960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> could offer her what she wanted.
<SYNC Start=4900880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4903320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
They left.
<SYNC Start=4904720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4907200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I followed them.
<SYNC Start=4908800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4910440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I crossed France, the Channel...
<SYNC Start=4912800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4915080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I was...
<SYNC Start=4916360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4917160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> humiliated.
<SYNC Start=4918480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4921000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Until the day she died<br>in an accident.
<SYNC Start=4923640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4926480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Since then,<br>I've never loved another woman.
<SYNC Start=4929200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4930800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=4931440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4932120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I stopped believing.
<SYNC Start=4933760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4936000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe I never met the woman...
<SYNC Start=4938160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4942000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Maybe you're the woman<br>I never met.
<SYNC Start=4945000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4947040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The story doesn't end there.
<SYNC Start=4948720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4949240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=4950400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4952080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
A while ago,
<SYNC Start=4953800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4954080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I was given a difficult case.
<SYNC Start=4956200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4956680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
On it was written the name<br>of the defendant:
<SYNC Start=4959920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4960160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Hugo Holbling.
<SYNC Start=4961600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4961800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The same man.
<SYNC Start=4963160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4964120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He'd come back here.
<SYNC Start=4965520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4971600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm closing up.
<SYNC Start=4972880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4975280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you see a woman<br>with a bucket?
<SYNC Start=4976960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4981280><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The storm flooded the wardrobe.
<SYNC Start=4983080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4983520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
If you see her,
<SYNC Start=4984200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4984720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> tell her I'm upstairs.
<SYNC Start=4986120><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4992360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You shouldn't have taken the case.
<SYNC Start=4994320><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4994960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I didn't want to.
<SYNC Start=4996080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5001240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
At first,<br>I wanted to kill him.
<SYNC Start=5002480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5004720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I would have,<br>if it would have changed something.
<SYNC Start=5007680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5010600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Now,
<SYNC Start=5011400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5012440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> he was waiting for my verdict.
<SYNC Start=5014200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5016800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
He was building<br>a covered market which caved in.
<SYNC Start=5019800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5020080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Several people died.
<SYNC Start=5021920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5024480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I said he was guilty.
<SYNC Start=5026200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5027680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
It was a legal sentence.
<SYNC Start=5029560><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5033880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Afterwards,<br>I asked for early retirement.
<SYNC Start=5036680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5040600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Did you see her?
<SYNC Start=5041920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5045360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'm always running after her!
<SYNC Start=5046680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5049640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Milana!
<SYNC Start=5050680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5059600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
There you are! Give me the buckets.<br>They're heavy.
<SYNC Start=5063040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5071080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
You seemed to Like<br>my pear brandy.
<SYNC Start=5072920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5073160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I have another favor to ask you.
<SYNC Start=5075680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5076640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
<SYNC Start=5078480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5079240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'll come see you afterwards.
<SYNC Start=5080760><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5082520><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Please give me<br>one of the puppies.
<SYNC Start=5085000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5087880><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Will the fashion show be on TV?
<SYNC Start=5089920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5090800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Probably.
<SYNC Start=5092040><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5092600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I better buy a TV.
<SYNC Start=5094680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5094920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I have one l never use.
<SYNC Start=5096920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5097440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
My brother<br>can bring it to you.
<SYNC Start=5098720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5099000><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
His name is Marc.
<SYNC Start=5099960><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5100200><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
I'd Like to meet him.<br>I'II see you soon.
<SYNC Start=5103080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5104240><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Goodbye.
<SYNC Start=5105480><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5109720><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Do you have your ticket?
<SYNC Start=5111600><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5195680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Where do I go?
<SYNC Start=5197160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5197400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
This deck. That corridor.
<SYNC Start=5199160><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5206440><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Excuse me, I'm lost. F38?
<SYNC Start=5208400><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5208640><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
The deck above.
<SYNC Start=5209360><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

TRAGEDY ON THE CHANNEL<br>Seven passengers escape.
<SYNC Start=5379080><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5382920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>
Very bad weather<br>on the English Channel
<SYNC Start=5385680><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5385920><P Class=UNKNOWNCC> is making the rescuers' task<br>all the more difficult.
<SYNC Start=5388800><P Class=UNKNOWNCC>&nbsp;

Buck it out!
It's a form, for crying out loud!
What could be simpler? All you have to do is fill in the blanks.
What do I have to do, hire a nursemaid to hold your hand, put ribbons in your hair?
If you want him down, this is no huge problem.
You should be able to fill out a form correctly!
Then I'll just have to get somebody who can.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Get back to your desk,
Rebecca!
I was a good boy.
What's happening, boys?
I was a good boy.
Well, well.
What are you doing here?
I smell business.
Third bureaucrat this month.
Aah!
Hey, enough of this shit.
Tell Carl to shoot him.
He's fucking up traffic.
What's his name?
Jeffrey Arthur brose of the interstate commerce commission, whatever the hell that is.
What'd you say, man?
You said the what? The interstate commerce commission?
He didn't say that.
Yes, he did.
Here. Hold this.
Just tell them don't shoot.
Regis, get back here.
Just hang on a second.
Strap in. This is gonna get weird.
I wanna talk to this guy.
No! No! Go away!
Hey, hey, hey.
No, go away.
Any improper behavior on the part of any employee has to be reported.
Ok. Just be easy, man.
Look, I just wanna talk, all right?
See? I got no gun.
Got no gun.
I will kill myself.
I believe you.
I believe you.
I just wanna ask you a question.
Now, you work for the interstate commerce commission, right?
No. They let me go.
They just threw me out.
You, too?
They evicted me, too.
I mean, they bought up my whole apartment building so they could turn it into a parking garage for...
They're so unfair!
I agree.
"The durable goods division."
Now, can you please tell me what the hell that is?
What is that?
Don't work there anymore, and they're on the second floor.
But do you know anybody I could talk to?
Because I've been writing and I've been phoning them.
I sent an e-mail, and nobody calls me.
They're just jerking me around.
I'm telling you, it's driving me crazy, man.
No, I'm crazy!
Uhh!
They were gonna shoot you, Jeffrey.
Christ, Regis.
What are you, insane?
The gun's on safety.
All right, boys, I'm thinking this looks, uh...
Handled.
Come on, stingo.
Let's get out of here.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Move! Move!
Go! Go!
Sector 6 secure.
Sector one secure.
Go.
Freeze!
Corey luchessi.
I work here.
Sector 5 secure.
There's a gun on you.
Get up slowly.
Sorry, sir.
Sector 2 secure.
Sector 3 secure.
All sectors secure.
America held hostage, day 182, a special report.
CNN has just received this smuggled video footage showing American awacs soldiers in captivity and under extreme duress.
You see this?
Government officials expressed outrage upon viewing these tapes.
Pentagon sources say the U.S. seventh fleet remains on full alert in the sea of Japan at this hour.
Air force officials have reiterated their initial statement describing the awacs crew's mission as a routine flight...
Can you believe this?
I mean, what is this president waiting for?
...aircraft carrier in the Gulf.
North Korea maintains the awacs crew...
Is leaseholder one word or two?
It's one.
Damn.
In the face of growing capitol hill support for military intervention, the president called for Patience and stated that the negotiations...
Oh, I see. So you negotiate for 13.
How many do you go to war for? 14?
That it? I mean, everything's about numbers.
Healthy.
3, uh...
You're an alcoholic.
That's your third.
Hit me again, man.
Yeah?
Regis.
Mm-hmm.
It's farr.
Ok.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
Captain.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got a coat and a tie.
1600 what?
Yeah, Harlan Regis, homicide.
Detective Regis, come right on through, please.
I'll take your weapon.
You'll get it back when you leave.
This way, please.
Gentlemen.
Straight ahead.
Dang.
And straight down this hallway to the left.
Puncture wounds upper torso and base neck would be 5 to 8 centimeters across.
Lividity and rigor are progressing...
What's up?
Jimmy.
Get in here and take a look at this.
24, 25 years old tops.
She's a baby.
Man, what is the world coming to?
What time she found?
About 11:00.
Name?
Carla town.
Our best guess is she's dead maybe 3 hours.
Where's the first family?
Camp David.
Left yesterday afternoon.
So do you got an idea what the murder weapon is?
Well, it's not as clean as a knife, reg.
You see that jagged edge on the wound there?
It's not big enough to be scissors, so I figure it must be something smaller.
Excuse me. All film stays in house.
Orders.
Whose orders, tepper?
Anyone know what she was doing here so late?
You're not cleared.
Who invited you here anyway?
We did.
Sir, he's not cleared.
He's a D.C. homicide cop.
Well, if I'm not mistaken,
Mr. spikings, what I see over there is a homicide.
But jurisdiction... jurisdiction can go to hell.
With all due respect,
I'm in charge of white house security.
With all due respect, I'm the president's national security adviser.
A woman murdered in the white house
40 yards from where the president sleeps is a matter of national security.
Alvin Jordan.
Yes. Harlan Regis, homicide.
Sir, do you happen to know what she was doing working here so late on a Friday night?
Well, the government doesn't shut down just because it's Friday.
Ah, yes. I understand.
Oh, and do you know how many people were in the white house?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Carry on, detective.
Thank you, sir.
We'd like you to avoid using 2 words if you give any statements to the media.
The words are woman and murder.
You say all information will be forthcoming on an appropriate and timely basis.
Mr. spikings...
One more thing.
I'm gonna need everything you have on what she was working on... you'll get what's material.
Well, this is D.C., and, unfortunately, she's mine.
She was murdered in the white house, not in some alley out in southeast.
She was killed in my city.
She was killed in my house.
Don't you ever forget that.
He's all yours.
Hey, I'm just trying to do my job.
Oh,
I guess I'm supposed to get my briefings from CNN, right?
No, you get it from your secret service liaison for the task force.
Well, he didn't assign me one.
Yes, he did.
Nina chance.
I see. They think
I'm boo boo the fool.
Excuse me?
So I guess he figures that
I'll be easier on you than I would some rookie with acne, right?
Detective,
I'm an on-line agent for the United States secret service, which means, among other things, that I'm fully qualified to answer any questions relating to white house security.
Furthermore, I resent the implication... furthermore, you resent the implication?
Man.
People don't even speak
English in this town anymore.
Detective, it's this way.
I know that.
There's been no statement yet about what's happening in the white house.
We've been told only that the first family is at camp David for the weekend.
As you can see behind me, the immediate area has been sealed off.
Sheldon turcott,
CNN, at the white house.
Why kill someone from the office of protocol?
Maybe she sat some ambassador in the wrong seat.
Oh, they kill you for that now?
Tough town.
If I would have known,
I would have put a turnstile in here and charged admission or something.
Who else was here?
Um, secret service.
They started around 11:15.
And can you believe they even took her garbage?
Anyway, if you guys want me,
I'll be downstairs,
Thank you very much.
Anytime.
Wait a minute.
The body's found at 11:00, and the feds arrive here
15 minutes later.
How do they do that?
Yeah. They don't even have cool sirens like we do.
Look at her photo album.
Look at this, Regis.
Is this the only one?
It's the only one
I see, but, you know,
I just got here.
I can tell you that the apartment is registered in the name of, uh...
Brookland associates, but that is about all
I have right now.
Psst.
Wow. 1.2 on the beach.
White house giving out some pretty sweet Christmas bonuses this year.
Yeah, looks that way.
I want a complete list of everybody in-house last night between 9:00 and 11:00, and don't tell me that is classified.
Quick on the draw, huh, agent chance?
There's only 30 names here.
All whereabouts accounted for.
Spikings told me that there were 31.
I mean,
I see his name here.
So whose name is missing?
Well, apparently, agent spikings was mistaken.
The count is 30 in-house.
Better check it out.
I'm on it.
So, agent chance, where you from?
Iowa.
Iowa, huh?
So why the secret service?
I mean, why not...
Why not kindergarten teacher?
No, you don't look like one of those at all.
I was in the Olympics.
The Olympics?
That's how I got in the secret service.
Is that right?
I was on the sharpshooting team.
I met president Reagan.
It was in 1988.
One of his agents was a woman.
She sort of took me under her wing.
Mmm. Sharpshooting. Ha.
I feel safe already.
I brought home the gold.
Wow.
Where are we going?
To my place.
I gotta change.
You're being evicted?
The whole damn building.
The feds are tearing it down to put up a parking garage for the, uh...
For the, uh...
Interstate commerce commission.
Yeah.
What do they need a parking lot around here for?
Hell if I know. I've been trying to figure that out.
Whole building thinks that I can fix it because I'm a cop.
Harlan, what's going on?
Mrs. Wallace.
Look, in less than a month, we're going to be living out on garbage cans.
I'm making progress,
Mrs. Wallace.
Truly I am.
Progress?
Is that what you call it?
Progress.
I should say you are making some progress.
You better take care of your business, boy.
You know that?
That's what you should be doing is taking care of your business.
Making progress.
I know what he's making progress at.
All right, make yourself comfortable.
Washington city,
July 21, 1861.
And this is manassas, first battle of bull run.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Right here, that's where stonewall
Jackson got his nickname.
That's sutley Springs there.
Civilians used to come on that crest over there and take carriages and picnics to watch the battle.
Amazing, huh?
How did you...
I'm a homicide cop in the homicide capital of the world.
It's cheaper than a shrink.
You did this all by yourself?
Mm-hmm.
Yep.
The whole thing.
My father was a history buff, so I guess it kind of rubbed off on me.
And what did he do?
He worked at the Smithsonian for about 34 years as a guard.
How am I gonna move all of this?
I mean, first, I gotta take it all apart, and then I gotta put it all back together again.
Oh, no. Hell, no.
I can't move.
I'll be right back.
Detective Regis, stengel's been looking all over for you.
Who isn't?
Regis, remember that claim check?
I sent greeley to the drug store.
Hey.
Hi.
All right, let's see what we got.
And there she is, live and in color.
Where'd you get these?
We're gonna be late for the autopsy.
We gotta go.
Her visa card activity, last 24 hours.
Banning travel,
1,500 bucks.
I got it by a nose hair.
Her phone records, her credit card, her bank account all impounded and now classified.
She had a shuttle flight to New York, a reservation at the Pierre, a hertz rental car, connecting flight to the
Virgin Islands, St. Croix, one way.
Lady was buying herself a new life.
She wasn't coming back, uh-uh.
All right.
The evidence indicates a crime of passion.
There's clear evidence of vaginal penetration.
There's traces of lubricant in the vaginal tract and under the fingernails.
The blows were from the left and powerful.
A condom was used.
No semen...
No blood except hers...
No DNA.
Signs of force?
No.
So you're saying sex, not rape?
This doesn't leave the room.
It was here we saw the image of an untroubled president Jack Neil before the white house murder cast a dark cloud over this once highly regarded administration.
Corey Alan luchessi, janitor.
Nobody can account for him during a 45-minute period prior to the point where the secret service found him working in the east room at 11:02.
The time of her death has been set between 10:30 and 11:00.
That guy eats a jelly doughnut, and then he stabs her 8 times.
Lee Harvey oswald was seen in the book depository cafeteria drinking a coke a minute after Kennedy was shot.
He's reading soap opera digest.
2 months ago.
No, that's not enough.
If that's all you got, you got nothing.
Except this.
It was found in the bathroom.
It's the missing button from a shirt found in luchessi's apartment.
Luchessi doesn't clean the bathrooms.
All right, where is he?
They're picking him up.
What would it take for me to see all the surveillance tapes from that night?
Not much.
Just an act of congress.
After you, detective.
Hal, that button was labeled as being found in the dining room.
How did it get up in the lavatory?
Uh, I just must have labeled it wrong.
Luchessi...
Luchessi...
Did you kill her?
Did you ever have an affair with Carla town?
No.
No. Never.
But you did come on to her though, right?
You did come on to her, yeah?
Did you come on to Carla town?
Yeah.
I came on to her.
I mean, you ever get a look at her?
Oh, yeah.
Hot.
You ever take it any further than that?
No.
I mean, listen to me.
Carla...
Was strictly hands-off.
What do you mean, hands-off?
I don't know.
But that... that was the word.
The secret service was looking out for her.
How?
I don't know. Uh...
L-like if she worked late, see. Um...
Well, the secret service guys, they would always drive her home.
Don't want that, don't want that...
That.
This is an act of war.
This is the pueblo revisited, and he wants to negotiate?
Give me a break.
Neil negotiating to defend us at a table?
Why, he can't even defend his own house.
Fred, Fred, look.
Let me remind you that China and north Korea had a defense pact for 35 years.
You don't want to go in there with thousands, maybe 10s of thousands of American lives...
Where is your rider at?
He's absolutely right.
He's got a sense of history about this.
In '94, a U.S. helicopter pilot crossed over to north
Korean territory...
How did you get down here?
Ok...
If you want to live, open the door 2 inches and slide your weapon out nice and easy.
Don't make me have to stain my linen.
Out!
Shit!
It's a nasty-ass city, Regis.
Congratulations.
You are now a statistic.
Let me see that.
Son of a bitch.
So they're eavesdropping, for Christ's sake.
Big surprise.
It's the government.
Look,
They brought you in on this for the same reason they brought the doctors in Dallas to work on Kennedy 2 hours after he was killed.
They have to be seen to be going the extra mile so that nobody could say they could've done more.
Well, you never would have let me hold luchessi on what they have.
You know that.
All right.
Go back and take another look at it, but don't make any fucking noise till you have something real.
Yes, sir.
Come on, Carla...
Talk to me.
Talk to me.
Talk to me...
This is full frame?
Drug store machines automatically crop.
Can you get me closer to this?
No problem.
He's secret service.
Can you make me a hard copy?
Thank you.
You're the man.
Yes, could I have a, uh, fruit juice, please?
Hey.
Hey, aren't you, um...
The speaker of the house.
Yeah. How you doing?
How you doing?
Good, thanks.
Hey, listen, do you ever speak to anybody at the interstate commerce commission?
I... i assume that organization or something...
I'm not really sure... but they're evicting me.
In fact, they're evicting... excuse me. Mr. speaker?
The detective's services are needed elsewhere.
Don't worry about it.
I'll... I'll call you.
Right.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
I'm trying to find you.
Look, the task force is closed.
We have a suspect.
Yeah. Me, too.
Who's that?
He's secret service. You should know.
Who is he?
I can't tell you.
What, is that classified, too?
Yes, it is.
Ok. I'll just have to find out for myself.
There he is right there.
The one who just stepped to the podium.
That's him.
What's his name?
I can't tell you that.
Well, look, either you help me, or I'll have to find out the loud way.
All right.
Please.
What's his name?
Burton cash.
Who's he assigned to?
Kyle Neil.
The president's son?
Ladies and gentlemen...
It brings me great honor to present the first lady of the United States,
Mrs. kitty Neil.
If the bodyguard was there, that means that Kyle was on that boat as well.
...Domestic violence has shattered 3 more homes in America.
Kyle Neil was having an affair with Carla town.
He's the one who had sex with her that night.
You should transfer up here right now.
Silence is the lie that says all is well.
I've got to go.
Hey, hey, hey, how long do you think it'll be before the media finds out that the president's son was banging her an hour before she died?
I've got to go.
Nice dress.
...With industry, and concerned citizens and say it's enough?
You are to have no further contact with detective Regis.
Is that understood?
What if he initiates contact, sir?
Then I want a report, detailed and immediate.
Written?
Beginning with what you two just discussed.
Right now.
Kyle?
Excuse me.
Kyle?
Kyle?
Uh...
We used to date.
Then you know how it works.
I think you should get some revenge.
Excuse me?
You should get revenge.
And how do I go about getting that?
Move to New York, become a big model, don't take his phone calls anymore...
Interesting.
I need a drink.
Would you like one?
Your treat?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
What would you like?
Whatever the lady's buying.
Bourbon?
Nice.
After 2 bourbons, she's telling me his underwear preference and that his one mission in life is to get laid in every room in the white house.
That sounds like a plan to me.
She even told me this... she said once Kyle even bragged about sharing a mistress with his father.
Carla town?
Well, she wasn't sure who.
Well, it gets better than that, man.
Her uncle's company, brookland associates... leading east coast fund-raiser for Jack Neil.
Really?
I mean, the company that leased the president's campaign space owned her apartment.
Well, this is good.
This is very good.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Good night, now.
Night, dear.
What, do you want to see my badge?
Why did you come here?
So I'm digging...
I'm going through the people magazine and just happened to come across page 16.
I find a picture of Kyle coming back from Brazil, and you're standing next to him with an earpiece.
You know, I must have looked at 18 months of pictures of this guy, and you know what I found?
I found that you were in over half of them.
You were on his detail and you didn't tell me.
Until when?
I have nothing more to discuss with you about this.
The case is closed.
Agent chance, when did they remove you from Kyle's detail?
You show up here grilling me about work?
Just answer the question.
Don't come to my home again.
Answer the question!
You waltz in here expecting me to violate every oath I've ever taken.
I have a duty to protect!
Your duty could send an innocent man to prison for the rest of his life.
Are you comfortable with that?
I... i think you should leave.
How is that spikings finds a button in the bathroom that no other detective found, huh?
What, did he plant it there?
I asked you to leave.
Did he plant the button?
I don't know, ok?
Everybody's lying around here.
Ok, so again...
Why did they remove you from Kyle's detail?
They didn't remove me.
One night...
I heard sounds...
Of violence... fighting... coming from his apartment.
So I went in, and I found him...
Beating up his girlfriend.
And it was ugly.
And they...
We...
Covered it up for him.
That was even uglier.
And that's when I asked to be reassigned.
Look, Nina,
I don't know what I would do if I was you, but I do know one thing.
I could not let an innocent man fry for something he did not do.
Maybe you can.
Get Neil out!
Bring our soldiers home!
Get Neil out!
Testing 1, 2, 3.
Testing.
The response? North Korea has broken off negotiations...
The dark cloud that seems to be hanging over this administration...
By an incredible turn of events, the FBI has not been able to interview the first son, now said to have been in the white house at the time of the murder.
Get Neil out!
Bring our soldiers home!
I have this to add to the Carla town effects.
Could you open it, please?
Sure.
Thank you, agent chance.
No problem.
Go on through.
Thanks.
Ok.
Hello?
Hello.
Any problem?
No. I finally found everything.
You all done then?
Yeah. Yeah.
Spikings wants to see you.
Now.
Is there anything
I should know about?
I don't know.
Is there?
You were in the Olympics.
You know what it means to be a team player?
Sharpshooting isn't a team sport.
Well, this is.
We put our lives on the line...
Every single day.
We have to trust the people we work with.
Is there a problem?
You tell me.
This case is closed.
So I've heard.
Harlan Regis hasn't.
You would tell us if he tried to contact you, wouldn't you?
Of course.
Good.
'Cause if anybody found out he elicited your support for his paranoid theories,
I'd hate to think how that would look.
What people might think...
As a team.
Why is the door shut?
Excuse me?
Why are your hands on me?
'Cause if anyone walked in here,
I'd hate to think how that might look, what people might think.
As a team.
In this day and age, they might get the wrong idea.
Sir...
Agent chance examined
Carla town's effects
8 minutes ago.
Get her.
And Cooper...
Do it quietly.
Yes, sir.
Nina chance... find her and lock her down.
You two cover the stairwell.
I'll take the front.
Hey, Nina.
Hey.
We got a visual.
I got it. I got it.
Hey...
Cover the front.
Right.
Your approval rating's dropped 19%.
Your point?
The point is, that it's enough to distract anybody.
From making a sober judgment?
I can't defend my own house, so how am I going to defend America?
We're a superpower.
We should act like one.
And so is China.
Which, the last time I looked, had a defense pact with north Korea.
We can handle
China... Now.
10 years time, at the rate they're arming, who the hell knows?
Mr. president...
Let's bring the boys back.
We can go in with special forces.
Alvin?
General Tully has a point.
53% of America... think we should strike the north Koreans.
The vice president's point just amplifies mine.
Mr. president...
Jack...
I'm not going to war over this.
Alvin...
I want the 7th fleet to stand down.
Not turn around.
Stand down.
If that doesn't bring them back to the table, we'll reconvene.
All right, thank you,
Mr. president.
Gentlemen?
You may be prepared to sit around here while they're torturing our boys. I'm not.
We're not being passive.
We're being patient.
And prudent.
Mr. president...
I feel duty-bound to tell you that your lack of action here borders on the criminal.
Then you've done your duty, general.
Now I'll do mine.
I expect your resignation on my desk in the morning.
You shall have it.
That's all, gentlemen.
Alvin?
What's the matter?
Here.
This is Carla's tape from my answering machine.
Well, how'd you get it?
That's right.
I stole it.
Look...
Here's what you need.
In her appointment book, she has a meeting in there scheduled for tomorrow in New York.
Craig nisker and associates?
He's the king of tell-all.
His agency sold 5 of the top 10 scandal memoirs of all time.
That's his motive.
I'll be damned.
Jack, Kyle, and Carla...
The oval office threesome.
Figure she was going to burn the whole family.
She was going to score big with this.
I guess Kyle found out about it.
We can place him at the scene of the crime, and we know that he had a history of violence against women.
That's it.
Oh, he's mine.
Well, you just don't get it, do you?
These people can make us disappear.
I've got to get out of here.
Where are you going?
I checked into a motel.
I'll call you.
Be careful.
The court may direct what?
Mr. Peterson?
Uh, under 21.98 of the criminal code, the court may allocate a fine for the children of the victim.
Please,
Mr. Peterson, please.
What is it, the porch light's on, but nobody's home, is that it?
Or the victim's spouse.
Incorrect, Mr. Peterson.
The court may direct that the amount of the fine when paid be paid for the use of the female seduced or her child if she have any.
Now, pursuant to this statute, we have Desmond vs.
Presley, which states...
Where testimony in rape prosecution concerning clothing of defendant was technically... what is it, Mr. Neil?
Heavy date?
That's... that's pretty funny.
Hey.
You look good.
What's going on?
I just need your car, all right?
Hey!
Get the fuck off of me!
Easy! Easy!
Jesus Christ, man, you are a son of a bitch.
I'm going to have your goddamn badge, you know that?
Why didn't you just shoot her if you had this, huh?
You know who I am? You know who you're dealing with?
I don't give a shit who you are.
You're going down.
Turn around.
Get off of me!
Get over here.
Just like a big fish.
Fell right for the bait.
Or a man who wants to know who's trying to frame him.
You were with her that night.
You had sex with her, and then you offed her.
Oh, Jesus.
You think it was an accident she was murdered an hour after I slept with her?
Someone knew I'd be there with her that night.
Yeah, maybe somebody with a motive as good as yours.
What motive?
Did your father have sex with Carla town?
I don't know my father's sexual resume.
You knew that she was leaving town, though.
Yeah, I read the newspapers.
2 nights in New York, a connecting ticket to the Virgin Islands, and a hertz rent-a-car.
So?
So, Carla town didn't have a driver's license.
You think
I killed Carla?
Yeah.
You think you could prosecute me?
Your arms don't reach that high, detective.
Still don't understand why you showed up.
I go to sleep every night thinking about a woman with 8 stab wounds.
A woman that I slept with an hour before.
You try that as a sleeping pill.
Hey, you forgot something.
In what is fast rivaling the north Korean hostage-taking as an issue of concern for the white house, the murder of Carla town remains unsolved.
As the attention of Washington homicide detectives turn to Kyle Neil, and the president's approval ratings continue to plummet, we must ask...
Will Carla town be
Jack Neil's chappaquiddick?
At this hour, no one knows where the trail will end.
We do know that for an administration already knee-deep in troubled waters of a potentially international confrontation in north Korea, a serious domestic concern of this nature is especially dangerous to the president's public image.
If Jack Neil is unable to protect the workers under his own roof...
Coffee?
Yeah.
Come on, Regis.
Sorry I'm late.
What's the matter?
What is it?
They were there.
Who was where?
The president and the first lady.
They weren't at camp David when Carla was murdered.
They were in the white house!
How do you know this?
That morning, I almost shot their golden retriever.
They never go anywhere without that dog.
Tonight, I saw footage of them coming back from camp David with the dog.
Their alibi is complete bullshit.
So, that means they took them to camp David after the body was discovered.
Yeah.
Spikings. He could have smuggled them out.
How?
The tunnels underneath the white house.
Now, hey, look, I built this city, remember?
I just can't believe this.
They covered it up, and they got them out?
Why?
Because then they'd be considered suspects just like everybody else.
Why should they be, though?
That's the question.
Because he's the president of the United States.
What does that mean?
That he doesn't have a motive?
He has a mistress about to drop a tell-all.
That's motive enough.
The wounds are from the left.
President Neil is right-handed.
Yeah, I noticed that.
He writes with his right hand, but he swings a baseball bat and a golf club with his left.
Jesus.
Yeah, she's still there.
Now, do you want me to finish this?
No. They're right where we want them.
We're right on schedule.
Thanks, Regis.
I appreciate it.
I can take care of myself.
I want you to lay low until I get to Jordan or spikings.
Ok. Yeah.
Ok?
Secret service.
Shit! Mmm!
Back door.
Hey!
Move! Move!
Get them!
Go!
Go! Go!
Go for the gas tank!
He's clear!
Come on!
Harlan, what about Nina chance, huh?
Detective, do you have any more information... detective, is the white house involved?
You want the spotlight?
Become a rock star.
I'd reassign you, but it'd make even more news.
Come in!
Call for you, detective Regis.
I'm not taking any calls.
It's the white house.
How lovely for you.
That was some stunt you pulled last night, detective.
Last night had nothing to do with me.
I was off-duty.
Why do I find that difficult to believe?
I don't care what you believe.
I want to know why the president was in residence the night of the murder, and you didn't tell me.
The president's not to be involved.
The president is about to become an official suspect.
Whoa.
Suspect?
Look, it's my duty to question... you're not questioning the president.
The presidency is an institution, not a person.
That institution will be protected at all costs.
Why do you think we got them out of there that night?
I don't know. Maybe cover up a crime.
No. To get the smell of blood away from the north Koreans.
They'd eat us alive. We'd never get our boys back.
This is global, detective.
It's a little bit off your turf.
This is a homicide.
This is my turf.
Let me tell you something.
I've known Jack Neil for 3 decades.
I'm godfather to his son.
Your suspicions are ludicrous.
Luchessi's a stooge.
How?
Then prove it.
Nobody can pinpoint the actual time of death, and he can't prove his whereabouts for an hour.
There are 27 cameras covering the hallways of the working white house.
You're telling me none of them captured her walking down a hallway within 3 minutes of her death?
Or are you trying to tell me?
The tapes are classified.
Out of my reach.
You republican or democrat?
I think Washington is drowning in a sea of its own bullshit.
Those 13 men aren't risking their lives over bullshit, pal.
Well, this is not about those 13 men.
It's about a dead woman in the white house.
You know...
Harvard did a study.
Said you could measure a man's longevity by the first thing he turns to in the morning paper.
Well, I'm an obituary man.
Start with the comics.
You'll live longer.
Whoever leaked this,
I'm going to bottle their last breath.
Sir, if she was alive at 10:49, she had to be murdered while at... this doesn't change a damn thing about luchessi.
Nobody saw him until 11:02.
That still gave him
13 minutes to do the job.
Regis... What are you going to do?
Put the president in a lineup?
Ok. You're Carla town.
You're about to sell this story for a shitload of money.
You're going to move to paradise.
You buy a one-way ticket, never to return, right?
This is sears calling for Carla town, confirming Monday between 8:00 and 12:00 to install the trash compactor you bought yesterday.
Why the hell would you have a trash compactor installed 2 days after you're gone?
Maybe she forgot?
She just bought it the day before.
What?
Shit!
Monday, 4:30.
You're right.
What have you got?
Wait a minute...
And the handwriting on the 23rd?
The slope of the writing is different.
Here.
Look at this.
The loop on the top of this
"L" is smooth and continuous.
In the day planner, here, there's an obvious pause in the writing.
Mm-hmm. Which indicates a deliberate stroke.
Here.
It's on the "b" as well.
This is a forgery.
There never was an appointment.
She wasn't going anywhere.
Spikings?
Entered at 12:09, left at 12:14.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
Surveillance tapes.
Well, he had clearance.
Thank you.
Bob?
Yes, sir?
I want to talk to detective Regis, D.C. homicide.
He's going to want to question Nick spikings.
Get me spikings' address in Alexandria.
Yes, sir.
Somebody's been playing us like puppets.
What are you saying?
Carla town wasn't killed to protect the administration.
She was murdered to destroy it.
What do you mean?
I'm saying that somebody dumped the dead body in the white house so that the blood trail could lead right to the first family.
They even manufactured the motive.
So?
Only the guard knew I took the tapes.
That means you've got someone on the inside.
It's time you and I stopped playing games.
Sit down.
You have any idea what it takes to stand all day in one place watching a dumpster in the pouring rain?
Because that dumpster just happens to be next to a hotel where the president is going to be staying the following day?
And his life is in your hands.
Loneliest job in the world.
Get rid of the wire.
I know who's listening anyway.
Regis.
Think you got it all figured out, huh?
You haven't read me right at all.
I see my life and my service with a clarity you're incapable... shit.
Shit!
Aah!
Shit!
Cover me!
Go!
Thought you were a sharpshooter.
Save it.
Freeze China out if they stand with north Korea.
All talks for a grain deal cease until they stand down.
If China wants grain,
I want our boys back.
You got 5 minutes, al.
I'm afraid it's going to take longer than that.
It's bad news,
Mr. president.
It's still Jack, Alvin.
Nick spikings is dead.
What?
And he had evidence that
Kyle killed Carla town.
Spikings collected it.
They found a condom with Kyle's semen and the woman's fingerprints on it.
They found the murder weapon.
And a surveillance tape putting
Kyle and the woman together just minutes before the murder.
There's got to be another explanation.
No, no.
And spikings was just about to cut himself a deal to leak it.
Nick spikings?
He wouldn't do that to me.
Everybody has a price.
Not the first thing in your life you've been naive about, is it, Jack?
Obviously not.
Well, you're safe now.
So's Kyle.
Spikings...
Was murdered.
Just get a bucket and start getting the water out of the boat, you guys.
Mayday, this is the ketch Rene off Turner point... let's see what we got.
Jordan.
All right, he goes out there.
Hey, we got a special on that model this week, folks.
4 heads, 21... back off.
Sure. Only a couple left, though.
Just so you know.
8:16, he comes in.
I can even throw in a universal remote with that, you know?
Back off!
Sure, sure, take your time.
Just, uh, ask for Jack.
He comes in, and yet he leaves... wait.
Who's that?
I know that guy.
That's the guy that was at spikings'.
The 31st name.
Jordan walked him in.
Jordan set up the whole thing.
Yeah.
The investigation into the white house murder has resulted in 2 suspects.
The car, a burgundy
Chevrolet caprice, has been identified as the possible suspect car.
In other news, a strike is pending as workers' contract talks...
There won't be anything anyone can prove.
All the evidence will be destroyed.
What do you want?
Your resignation.
Effective 10 P.M.
I don't know why you look surprised, Jack.
Tully wasn't half-right when he called it criminal.
Because we didn't go in with guns blazing?
You think that would've saved our boys?
You have failed,
Mr. president!
You have failed your office pitifully.
I've seen your cowardice grow from the very beginning.
And then, finally, not having served your country in the military, you had no idea of the time-honored code of never leaving a man on the field of battle.
You should've brought those awacs boys home dead, wounded, or otherwise.
You should've done it by force if necessary.
Any president who serves up his country as appetizers for the enemy isn't fit for this office.
So the choice is yours.
You can... you can resign.
Say it's due to your health.
And you can tour the best golf clubs in America.
Or you can stay in office, and you can watch your son destroyed.
The choice is yours.
I mean, if any father can call that a choice.
Why didn't he just kill Neil?
Because it's easier to kill the secretary than it is the president.
Besides, alive and ruined is better.
Than what?
Than dead and martyred.
And now this special bulletin.
An oval office address is scheduled for 10:00 tonight.
Unidentified sources say the president will resign.
Jordan played his card.
In related news, all federal... all right, that gives us 2 hours to get to the white house and the president.
Are you insane?
How?
We'll use the tunnels the same way they got out.
You don't even know where they are.
Yeah, but you do.
I mean, you know the security, and you know the layout.
You're out of your mind.
Why, because I'm about to help a government that's kicking me out on the streets?
You got no argument there.
We got to get rid of this car.
Hello.
Don't say my name.
Just listen.
Remember where we had that homicide 2 weeks ago?
Yeah.
Ok. Meet me there in one hour.
Get down.
Cops.
That's the steam grate.
It'll take us to one of 3 points that are vulnerable to penetration in the white house.
Eisenhower put a water filtering system down in there.
There's got to be an alarm.
Yeah, there is.
It goes off all the way across town.
The general services building.
No white house, no secret service.
Response time?
Well, officially
5-7 minutes.
But realistically 10 or 11.
By that time we'll either be fired, or we're going to be dead.
I was a park ranger during that.
You?
What do you think?
Meet and greet time?
Ahem.
He said you did it, too.
Hold on.
Evening, officers.
Evening.
Tense night in the big city, huh?
Yeah.
Could be this thing with the president maybe, huh?
Nice to know, though, that we have our men in blue out here to keep a watchful eye over us.
Are you from Washington?
Ok.
Hey, didn't that old senator lay the wood to that stripper around here somewhere years ago?
All right. Take it easy this evening, huh?
Just asking.
Didn't see it on my... my guide map.
Ok, we'll see you later, all right?
All right, gentlemen.
Good night.
Good night.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Go.
Be careful.
Come on, come on, come on.
My grandmother moves faster than you.
Wait.
Where are we?
We're under the mall.
That's Pennsylvania Avenue.
Which way?
It's not far.
Oh, Christ.
Now what?
End of the line.
This is the old emergency water system.
These pipes go right through the wall.
Good, 'cause that's where we're going.
After you're sworn in, you'll make a short statement saluting Jack Neil for his service to his country.
You'll ask for the country's prayers for bi-partisan unity.
Would you 2 excuse us now, please?
Thank you very much.
Gentlemen, at 2400 hours, president Dylan will sign off on the raid into north Korea.
We're looking for a steel door.
What do you got?
Army corps of engineers.
These are the escape tunnels.
Lincoln had these built in case the confederates laid siege to the white house.
Who says history isn't practical?
We're running out of time.
Go.
You first.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
What the... whoa.
You hear that?
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Christ.
Oh, stengel.
Go ahead. I'll be ok.
Ok.
Hang in there, all right?
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh!
We got to cross over.
Tonight, in less than an hour,
Jack Neil will step down after a little more than 2 years in office.
For CNN, I'm Doris MacMillan reporting.
Let's do this.
Ok, wait.
We're here.
These are motion sensors.
They trip the alarm in the white house.
We set those off and this room fills up with agents.
How long?
10 seconds.
We've come too far to turn back now.
Yeah.
I'll hold them off as long as I can.
Movement in 102.
Repeat, movement in 102.
Subsector-11 tunnels.
Repeat, tunnels, subsector-11.
Move! Get out of the way!
You're under arrest!
Drop your weapon!
Check the corridor all the way down.
Checking subsector grade.
Yo, go!
Cover sector-12.
Got it.
Freeze! Hold it!
Ok, on the ground.
On the ground!
Get on the ground.
Clear sector 7 right now.
Report back to me only.
Let's go.
What agent captured?
Get her up here.
Not now.
Hold it.
Let me see some I.D.
Agent, gun!
The janitor!
Jordan.
Get down!
Get down!
Get him!
He killed spikings!
Mr. president!
Your son is innocent!
Sir, you can't be here.
I am here.
Seal the corridor.
I am still the president!
Seal the corridor!
Alvin Jordan, you're under arrest for conspiracy in the murder of Carla town and Nicholas spikings.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one, you prick, one will be appointed by the courts.
How did you get in here?
I crawled.
He's the one who gave spikings the evidence on your son.
The evidence is you on tape with the man you walked in to kill Carla town.
The same man who put a bullet through Nicholas spikings.
Stand him up.
You don't have to believe me.
Just look at the tape.
It's in my back.
Agent?
Mr. president, Carla town was killed to destroy you.
To force your resignation.
Then Jordan had spikings shot because he saw the tape.
Arrest him.
What?
Not him.
Him.
My god, Alvin.
You really had her killed, didn't you?
I think president Teddy
Roosevelt said it best.
If I must choose between righteousness and peace,
I choose righteousness.
She was 25 years old.
She was a child.
She was a casualty of war.
Mr. president.
Get him out of here.
Thank you, son.
Gun!
Nina, just stay easy.
Stay easy.
Just stay easy.
I'm right here.
All right, hold on.
No, there's absolutely no truth whatsoever to any of those rumors.
At no time was president Neil planning on resigning from office.
Here's what we know so far.
The murderer of Carla town is dead.
He was killed today as he fired upon authorities attempting to arrest him.
In that same gun battle, national security advisor
Alvin Jordan and senior secret service agent Nicholas spikings were also killed.
Did the killer actually penetrate the white house with the objective of killing miss town?
In 180 years, there has never been a penetration of the white house.
President and Mrs. Neil will have a statement for you later.
Thank you very much.
Call D.C. homicide.
Tell them the detective we found in the tunnel is on his way to university hospital.
Paramedics say he's going to be fine.
How is she?
She's stable.
You saved my life.
Thank you.
And detective, how can I ever repay you?
Mmm, don't bother.
Just doing my job.
Well, there is one thing.
Yes, detective?
Have you ever heard of the interstate commerce commission?
Sure.
Secretary Randall's office is right down the street.
Right down the street?
Yeah.
See? It's not what you know, it's who you know.
What are you doing for dinner?
What... what... i mean,
I'm not trying to...
Captioning made possible by
Warner bros.
Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
They were heard screaming at each other for 2 hours. Nothing new.
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.
A crime of passion.
Yeah.
Just look at all the passion on that wall.
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.
Did the kid see it?
What?
The kid?
What kind of question's that?
We'll be real glad when we get rid of you, Somerset. Always these questions.
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?
He's dead.
His wife killed him.
Anything else has nothing to do with us.
Detective Somerset?
I'm Detective Mills.
Just get in town 20 minutes ago, they dump me here.
Look...
Mills?
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.
Not much time for this transition thing.
I had a question, when we spoke on the phone.
Yeah.
Why here?
I don't follow.
Well, all this effort to get transferred.
It's the first question that popped into my head.
Same reason as you. Or the reason you had before you decided to quit.
You just met me.
Maybe I don't understand the question.
It's very simple.
You actually fought to get reassigned here.
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.
It'd be great if we didn't start out kicking each other in the balls.
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.
- Not here.
- I understand.
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective, do me the favor of remembering that.
SE7EN
MONDAY
MONDAY
Yeah.
Okay.
Say it again?
I thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls.
Serpico's got to go.
Well, you might want to get rid of this little... crusty, this eye, Serpico.
- Did you get it?
- Got it.
Good.
Coffee?
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.
What time was death established?
Like I said...
I didn't touch anything... but he's had his face in spaghetti for 45 minutes.
Wait. No one bothers with vital signs?
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.
Thank you.
I wonder.
What was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Don't know. How many times Barney Five found dead bodies that weren't dead.
Drop it.
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.
Better Homes and Gardens.
Spaghetti Sauce
Who said this was murder?
No one.
Guy's heart must be the size... of a canned ham.
If this isn't a coronary... well...
I don't know.
Whoops.
How about that.
We had this case once... guy dead on the ground... knife in his back.
Murder... right?
Fuck!
Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah? So the guy... took the tip of the blade... stuck it in his own shoulder blades.
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.
Wait a minute.
What?
Got a bucket here.
What's in it?
Oh God!
Fucking vomit.
Any blood in it?
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.
Are you thinking it's poison?
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.
Think it's poison, Somerset?
You girls have got forensics waiting outside.
We might not fit.
There's room. Light's the problem.
How are you?
Det. Mills, go help the officers... question the neighbors.
What?
And send in forensics.
He's dead.
Thank you, Doctor.
You saw my files, the things I've done?
Nope.
I did door-to-doors and walked the beat. I did that shit... a long time.
- And?
- My badge says...
"detective".
That's the same as yours.
Look, I made a decision.
I had to consider the integrity of the scene... not whether you were getting enough time on the field.
Hey, man...
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.
He's been dead... a long time, and not from poison.
Oh, man.
How can you let yourself go like that?
It took 4 orderlies just to get him on the table.
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.
Look. See how big this stomach is?
And the strange thing is, it stretches.
Look at the size of the cardiac orifice, where the food...
I see that, but it means nothing to me.
Okay, he's got lines of distention... across the duodenum.
The interior wall's ripped open.
This man ate till he burst?
He didn't really burst. Not all the way. He was hemorrhaging internally.
There was a hematoma in the rectus and...
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?
Yes and no.
What about these bruises here?
I haven't figured that out yet.
Gun pressed against his head?
Pressed hard enough.
Fuck, yeah.
On the front, flush with the muzzle.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide.
Killer put a bucket beneath him, kept on serving. Took his time too.
Coroner said it could have lasted more than 12 hours.
Victim's throat was swollen, probably from the effort... and there was a point when he passed out.
That's when the killer kicked him...
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.
When you want somebody dead, you drive by and shoot.
You don't risk the time it takes to do this...
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy and tortured him. Simple as that.
In the grocery bags... we found 2 receipts. So, the killer stopped and went back... to the supermarket.
So?
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.
- This is beginning.
- We've got... one dead guy, not three.
No motive.
Don't start that big brain of yours... cooking on this, alright?
I'd like to be reassigned.
Whoa.
What are you talking about?
This can't be my last duty.
It'll go on and on.
You're retiring in 6 days.
You've left unfinished business before.
Those cases were taken as close to conclusion as possible.
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.
It's his first assignment.
I knew it. This is not my first assignment, you dick.
It's too soon.
I'm here. You can say that shit to my face. Captain?
It's too soon for you.
Captain...
Can we talk in private?
This is a personal thing--
Just shut up, Mills.
I don't have anyone else... to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.
Give it to me.
I'll put you on something else.
Go on, Mills, just go on.
I'm sorry, old buddy, but it looks like you're stuck... cleaning up the fat man.
TUESDAY
TUESDAY
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED
Quiet down.
Alright, calm down. Calm down.
Quiet down.
Here's how it'll work:
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes and 10 minutes only.
Ask those questions in a calm, sane, orderly fashion or I will leave.
Detective? Detective?
- Can I have a moment?
- No.
I won't discuss the details of this investigation, so don't bother asking.
What you got for me?
Nothing yet, boss.
Why don't you guys go get a coffee, huh?
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...
Eli Gould was found murdered today.
District Attorney Martin Talbot is taking questions from reporters.
That's ridiculous and offensive.
There is no conflict, and any claim there could be is irresponsible.
Now hold on.
I just met with law enforcement officials and they... assured me that they have their very best men on this.
This will be the very definition... of swift justice.
GREED
Pardon me, George.
Somerset.
Come in.
You heard the news?
Nope, haven't heard.
Eli Gould was found murdered this morning.
Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death.
Wrote the word "greed" on the floor.
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.
Mills is heading the investigation.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Don't do that, please?
Good for him.
What will you do... with yourself out there, Somerset?
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.
Don't you feel it?
Don't you feel that feeling?
You're not going to be a cop anymore.
That's the whole idea.
I don't think you'll leave.
Hell, you can't leave all this.
Guy's out walking his dog.
Gets attacked.
His watch is taken, his wallet.
And while he's lying... on the sidewalk helpless... his attacker stabs him in both eyes.
This happened last night about 4 blocks from here.
I read about it.
I don't understand anymore.
It's the way it's always been.
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.
I don't think you can deny that.
Maybe I'm wrong.
The coroner sent this down for you.
Found them in the fat boy's stomach... mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.
They were... fed to him.
Lord.
GLUTTONY
This was found behind the refrigerator in the obesity murder scene.
"Long is the way
And hard, that out of hell leads up to light."
It's from Milton.
"Paradise Lost."
Alright...
I'm confused.
It means that this is beginning.
GLUTTONY
This was behind the same refrigerator... written in grease.
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.
Gluttony... greed... sloth, wrath... pride, lust... and envy.
Seven.
Hold on.
This is not even my desk.
You can expect five more of these.
Wait a minute.
I can't get involved in this.
Somerset.
He wanted it.
Damn!
I'm all over it.
Where to?
Far away from here.
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.
Sit where you'd like.
How's everybody?
Hiya, Smiley.
George, the cards are getting cold.
Duty calls.
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...
I'll never understand.
All these books... a world of knowledge right here... and what do you do?
You play poker all night.
Hey, we got culture.
Yeah, we got culture coming out of our asses.
How's this for culture?

WEDNESDAY
Fucking Dante.
Goddamn poetry-writing fagot piece of shit.
Fucker.
Good work, Officer.
Thank you, Lord.
Oh, oh, sorry.
I'll move in a second.
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.
Yeah?
Phone.
Package deal.
Comes with the office.
Mills.
Honey...
You okay? Something wrong?
You dingleberry, I told you not to call me here when I'm working.
Yeah. Why?
Why?
Okay.
It's my wife.
Sorry?
She'd like to speak to you.
This is Detective Somerset.
Well, yes, it's nice to talk to you too.
I appreciate the offer, but...
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
Yes, thank you very much.
Bye.
Honey, what...?
Well?
Sorry?
I'm invited to late supper at your apartment. I accepted.
At my... How's that?
Tonight.
Hello, men.
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.
That's Tracy. Tracy...
Hello.
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Except your first name.
It's William.
Well, it's a good name...
William.
William, I'd like you to meet David.
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.
Aw, good dogs.
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?
Smells good.
Yeah, I mean, thank you.
Please have a seat, if you like.
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.
We're still unpacking.
I hear you were high school sweethearts.
Pretty hokey, huh?
You know something?
On our first date I knew he was...
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?
He was the funniest guy I ever met.
Really.
It's kind of rare nowadays.
I mean, that level of... commitment.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't wear it to the dinner table.
No matter... how often I see guns,
I just can't... get used to them.
Same here.
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.
What the hell?
I was close once.
It just didn't happen.
It surprises me.
It really does.
Well...
Anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable.
Just ask your husband.
Very true.
Very, very true.
How long have you lived here?
Too long.
How do you like it?
You know... takes time. Settle in... it'll be good.
Well, you get numb after awhile
There are things to any city...
Subway.
It'll go away in a minute.
This real estate guy.
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.
Then I start wondering why he'll only bring us here 5 minutes at a time.
We found out the first night.
The soothing, relaxing... vibrating home, huh?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.
I don't know why you're laughing.
Alright, already.
He had to get into the building... before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?
I'm certain. He was the biggest defense lawyer in town.
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.
Laid low till the cleaning crew left, then had... his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday, maybe Monday.
Look.
Gould was bound, right arm free.
He was handed a butcher's knife.
Check out the scale.
A pound of flesh.
"One pound of flesh"
"No more no less
No cartilage...
No bone.... only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."
Didn't see it.
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".
I tell you that chair was...
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.
The killer wanted Gould to take his time... deciding which cut.... to make first.
Imagine it.
There's a gun in your face.
Which part of your body is expendable?
The love handle.
Cut along the side of his own stomach.
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...
Look through it.
Edit out your initial shock.
The trick is to find one item, one detail and focus on it... until it's an exhausted possibility.
I'll get another beer. Beer?
Wine, please.
He's preaching.
Punishing.
The sins were used in medieval sermons.
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?
Yeah.
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill and check out all the sinners?
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.
But there pride comes first, not gluttony.
For now let's consider... the books as the killer's inspiration.
The sermons were about atonement for sin.
These murders are like forced attrition.
Forced what?
Attrition's when you regret your sins, but not because...
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.
No fingerprints.
Nope.
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.
And no witnesses of any kind.
Which I don't get... because the fucker had to get back out.
In any major city, minding your own business is a science.
In rape prevention, the first thing they teach you is never cry for help.
Always yell, "Fire!".
Nobody answers help.
Holler "fire," they'll come.
That's fucked up.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
You know what? Thank you for talking this out, but I must sleep.
Walk the dogs.
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.
Gould's wife. She was out of town at the time.
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.
What if it isn't what she has seen... but what she's supposed to see but hasn't had the chance?
Yeah, okay. What?
I don't know.
But that's the one thing.
I'll sign us in.
Must see Mrs. Gould.
Mrs. Gould?
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.
I don't understand.
I need you to look at each photo... very carefully.
Look and see if there's anything strange or... out of place, anything at all.
I don't see anything.
Please, I can't do this right now.
Okay.
It's got to be now.
There may be something we missed.
Wait.
What?
Here.
This painting, it's upside down.
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.
Those shots were taken before forensics.
Nothing.
There's got to be something.
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.
What the fuck is that?
Switchblade.
Goddamn it.
There must be something.
He didn't paint the fucking thing.
No, he's fucking with us, that's what he's doing.
See this, this is us.
Just wait a minute.
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.
You're kidding me.
Call the print lab.
Oh, man.
Honestly... have you ever seen anything like this?
HELP ME
The swell pattern tells me that they're not... the victim's fingerprints.
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.
It doesn't fit.
He doesn't want to stop.
Who knows.
Freaks out there doing their evil deeds they don't want to do.
"The voices made me do it".
"Jodie Foster made me do it".
It can take...
3 days to make a match, so maybe you guys want to cross... your fingers somewhere else.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?
About catching this guy.
Wish I still thought the way you did.
Tell me what the hell it is you think we're doing?
Picking up the pieces.
We're collecting all the evidence, taking all the pictures and samples... writing everything down... noting the time things happened.
That's all?
That's all.
Putting everything into neat piles and filing it away... on the off chance it'll be needed in the courtroom.
Picking up diamonds on a deserted island... saving them in case we get rescued.
Bullshit.
Even the most promising clues usually only lead to others.
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.
Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight.
I saw you.
We're getting somewhere.
THURSDAY
THURSDAY
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
We got a winner.
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.
Homicide found his prints at the scene.
He's got a long history of serious mental illnesses.
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.
Somewhere along the line they fell short.
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery and assault, spent time... in prison for the attempted rape of a minor.
His lawyer made sure that didn't last long. By the way... the lawyer was Eli Gould, the "greed" victim.
We'll stop this today, ladies and germs.
Victor's been out of circulation for awhile, but we've a residence for him.
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...
Like our guy, does it?
You tell me.
Our killer seems to have more purpose.
You ever take a bullet?
Never in my thirty-four years, knock on wood.
I've only taken my gun out...
3 times wanting to use it.
Never pulled the trigger.
Not once.
You?
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet, but...
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.
We were a secondary unit.
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.
We bust open the door looking for this junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.
One cop got hit in the arm.
Christ, what was his name?
It spun him like a top... no, Well, more, you know, more like slow motion.
I remember... riding in that ambulance... and, well... he died right there.
Right there.
Christ, what was his fucking name?
SWAT goes before dicks.
They love this.
Police!
Clear!
Good morning, sweetheart.
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!
Get up, you sack of shit.
Oh, fuck me.
Dicks!
You'll want to come take a look at this.
Dicks!
Jesus.
Victor?
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?
Hearse, I'd say.
Call for forensics.
Get your people out.
No one touches anything.
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.
Sloth.
Aw, man.
Goddamn.
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.
This must be the first.
Look.
It's dated exactly one year ago today.
I got a hair sample. I got a... stool sample. I got piss. I got... fingernails.
He's laughing at us.
You got what you deserved.
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!
Guns down!
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.
We must forget our emotion.
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I can hear you.
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.
I got a fucking right to be here.
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.
I got your picture, man.
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.
Detective Mills.
M-I-L-L-S. Fuck off.
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!
How they get here so fucking quick?
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.
Hey man, I'm sorry.
They piss me off.
It's okay.
It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.
1 year of immobility's right, judging by the muscle and spine deterioration.
Blood tests show a smorgasbord of drugs in his system.
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep the bedsores from infecting.
Now, has he tried to speak or communicate in any way?
Even if his brain were not mush, which it is... he chewed off his tongue long ago.
Doc.
Is there absolutely no chance that he might survive?
He'd die of shock right now if you shone a flashlight in his eyes.
He's had as much pain and suffering as anyone I've encountered, give or take and he still has hell to look forward to.
Good night.
Hello, William.
It's Tracy.
Tracy?
Everything okay?
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.
Where's David?
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.
I'm sorry to call you like this.
Oh, it's all right.
What can I do for you?
I need someone to talk... to. Do you think you could meet me... somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?
I don't understand.
I feel stupid calling, but... you're the only person that I know here.
There's no one else.
If you can... just give me a call, okay?
I have to go now.
Good night.
Good night.
FRIDAY
FRIDAY
I mean... you know this city so well.
You've been here... so long.
It can be a hard place.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Why don't you talk to him about it?
Tell him how you feel.
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.
Especially now.
I'll get used to things... you know?
I wanted to talk to someone... who's lived here for a long time.
I mean, upstate, it's a completely different environment.
Did David tell you that I teach fifth grade? Well, I did.
Yeah, he mentioned it.
I've been going around, looking at schools... but the conditions here are... horrible.
What about private schools?
I don't know.
Tell me what's really bothering you.
David and I are going to have a baby.
Oh, Tracy. I...
I don't think I'm the one... to talk to...
- about this.
- I hate this city.
I had a relationship once... it was very much like a marriage.
We got pregnant.
This was a long time ago.
I remember getting up one morning and going to work.
Just a day like any other, except it was the first day after I knew... about the pregnancy.
And I felt this fear... the first time ever.
I remember thinking... how can I bring a child into a world like this?
How can a person grow up with all this around them?
I told her I didn't want to have it.
And over the next few weeks...
I wore her down.
I want to have children.
I can tell you now that...
I know... I mean...
I'm positive that...
I made the right decision.
But not a day passes that I don't wish... that I had made a different choice.
If you don't... keep... the baby, I mean, if that's your decision... don't ever tell him you were pregnant. but if you choose to have the baby... then spoil that kid... every chance you get.
That's... about... all the advice I can give you, Tracy.
I must go.
William.
Thank you.
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust
Victor's landlord said there was cash in the mail box... the first of every month.
Quote:
"I never heard a single complaint from the tenant... in apartment 306, and nobody ever complained about him.
The best tenant I've ever had."
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.
Who pays the rent on time.
I'm sick of this waiting.
This is the job.
Why aren't we out there?
Why must we sit here rotting, waiting till the lunatic... does it again?-
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.
Come on, he's insane. Look.
Right now he's probably dancing around in his grandma's panties.
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter.
How's that?
I don't think so.
His luck'll run out.
He's not depending on luck.
We walked in there exactly 1 year after he tied Victor to the bed.
One year to the day.
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.
Oh, yes, we do.
This note he left... his first words to us.
"Long is the way, and Hard, that out of hell...
Leads up to Light."
Fuck him. So what?
He's right, so far.
Imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year.
To sever his hand and to use it... to plant fingerprints.
To insert tubes into his genitals.
This guy's methodical, exacting... and worst of all, patient.
He's a nut bag.
Because the fucker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda.
You got money?
I got 50. Fifty bucks.
I propose a field trip. Come on.
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating to the 7 deadly sins.
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.
What would he study to do the things he's done?
What are his interests now?
Jack the Ripper, for instance.
- Where are we going?
- Library.
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--
Discount coupons.
They must have had about 50 health violations during the last inspection.
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking... we're dating.
Give me your money.
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.
Somerset. How you doing?
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.
It's not a problem. Sit down.
Only for you do I do this, so it's a big risk.
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.
About an hour.
Yep. Help yourself.
That was money well spent.
Yeah.
Alright.
Telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
Good, 'cause I might punch you.
It's probably nothing, but even so, it's no skin off our teeth.
The guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the Bureau.
Who, stinky man?
For years, the FBI's been hooked into the library system, keeping records.
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.
Look.
Certain books are flagged.
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...
"Mein Kampf".
Anyone who checks out a flagged book has his library records fed to the FBI.
Wait. How is this legal?
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.
You can't use the information directly. It's just a useful guide.
It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card without an ID... and a current phone bill. See?
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.
If you want to know who's reading...
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost" and "Helter Skelter"... the FBI's computers will tell us.
It could give us a name.
Of a college kid writing a term paper... on 20th-century crime.
At least you're out of the office.
Get a haircut.
How do you know this?
I don't.
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.
"Divine Comedy".
"History of Catholicism" A book called "Murderers and Madmen".
"Modern Homicide Investigation".
"In Cold Blood".
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?
It's not what you think.
The Marquis de Sade.
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
Is that it?
Yep.
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?
Whatever.
We're sure about that name, are we?
You were, you saw it. John Doe.
You want to go back, I'll go back.
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.
This is crazy.
We'll just talk to him.
"Excuse me, sir. Do you happen to be a serial killer?"
You do the talking.
Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
You've talked to my wife?
Retarded.
Charlie's fucking Angels.
A name off a computer.
Mills.
- You hit?
- No.
He's going down!
Fifth floor!
Police. Is there a back way out?
Lock your door.
Get out of the fucking hall, please.
Get down!
Get the fuck down.
Goddamn it.
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.
Where are you going?
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.
What? He fucking shot at us.
You can't go in.
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.
Think about it. Think how did we get here?
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.
Just pay attention a minute?
With a hole like this, we won't be able to prosecute.
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.
We need a reason to knock on this door.
Think about it.
Okay?
Okay, okay.
You're right. I'm all fucked up.
When you're right, you're right.
Well... no point in arguing anymore.
Unless you can fix that..
You stupid son of a ...
How much money we got left?
So, yeah, I noticed... this guy going out a lot... when the murders were happening, so I...
So you called Det. Somerset?
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy... was creepy and shit, and one of the murders...
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.
Got everything?
Have her sign. You must sign.
Good.
You did good.
- I did what you said.
- Here.
You get something to eat.
Everybody stay outside.
Victor.
Wild Bill's Leather
Fuck.
LUST
Somerset!
- What?
- We had him.
What are you saying?
The fucking photographer in... the fucking stairs.
We had him and we let him go.
You're sure this is him?
Yep. Good. Get it out.
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?
We got his money. I like it.
Wait. You won't believe this.
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.
We could use some more men.
I'm doing my best.
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here... and each notebook contains about 250 pages.
What about the killings?
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are, what a gross stage we dance on.
What fun, dancing and fucking.
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.
We are not what was intended."
Wait, there's a lot more.
"On the subway today, a man came up to start a conversation.
He made small talk, a lonely man talking about the weather and things.
I tried to be pleasant... but my head began to hurt from his banality.
I almost didn't notice... but I suddenly threw up all over him.
He was not pleased... and I couldn't stop laughing".
No dates.
Placed on the shelves in no discernible order.
Just his mind poured out on paper.
Looks like a life's work.
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts, it'd still...
- take 2 months.
- I know.
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?
People, quiet!
I admire you.
I don't know how you found me, but I was surprised!
I respect you law enforcement officers more every day.
Well, I appreciate that, John.
- I tell you--
- No, listen:
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule in light of today's setback.
I just had to call and express my admiration. Sorry I had to hurt... one of you, but I had no choice, right?
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to say more but that'd ruin the surprise.
Got it.
Everybody back to work.
You were right.
He's preaching.
These murders are his sermons to us.
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.
Who's the blonde?
Looks like a pro.
Maybe.
She caught John Doe's eye.
Wild Bills' Leather
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?
- Yeah.
- This man?
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.
One sweet piece, actually.
I thought he was a performance artist.
You know the sort of guy that... pisses in a cup on stage and then... drinks it.
Performance art.
Right.
I think I undercharged him.
- You made this for him?
- I've made... weirder shit than that.
They found the blonde.
The picture!
The picture!
Fucking pigs.
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...
Get the fuck out of the booth.
I've been in this cage the whole time.
Come on, this way.
-Can you do something about the music?
-We're looking for the guy.
You from homicide?
You better see this.
Get this thing off me.
Oh God, get it off of me.
Get him out of here, now!
I want to hear it again.
Tell me again.
You heard nothing strange, saw nothing strange.
He asked me if I was married.
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?
The what? What?
The prostitute. Where was she?
Someone comes to your establishment... they want to go downstairs, get some oo-la-la. Whatever.
They got to come to you. Yeah?
Yeah.
You didn't see anyone?
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?
Everybody that comes in there's got to be a package under their arms.
Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff.
She was just sitting on the bed.
Who tied her down? You or him?
Do you like what you do for a living?
All these things you see?
No, I don't.
But that's life, isn't it?
He had a gun. And... he made it happen.
He made me do it.
He put that thing on me.
And he made me wear it.
Then he... told me to fuck her.
And I did. I fucked her.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.
The fucking gun was in my throat.
Fuck.
Oh, God. God.
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.
This won't have a happy ending.
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.
If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil... if he's Satan himself... that might meet our expectations.
But he's not the devil.
He's just a man.
You know...
You bitch and you complain and you tell me these things.
If you think you're preparing me for hard time... thanks, but...
But you got to be a hero.
You want to be a champion.
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?
I want to know.
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.
Go on.
I don't think I can continue to live in a place... that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue.
You aren't different or better.
I didn't say I was. I'm not.
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.
Apathy is a solution.
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life.
It's easier to steal what you want than to earn it. It's easier... to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.
No, we're talking about everyday life here.
You can't afford to be this naive.
Fuck off.
See, you...
You should listen to yourself.
Yeah. You say that... the problem is people don't care.
So, I don't care about people.
Nonsense. You know why?
You care?
Want to know-- Damn right.
You'll make a difference.
Whatever. The point is that... you're not quitting because you believe... these things you say.
You want to believe them... because you're quitting.
And you want me to agree with you and say "You're right, it's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess. We should all go live in a fucking log cabin."
But I won't.
I won't say that.
I don't agree with you. I do not.
I can't.
I'm going home.
Thank you, though.
I love you.
So much.
I know.
SUNDAY
SUNDAY
What's your emergency?
Could you repeat that?
I've done it again.
PRIDE
What have we got?
Sleeping pills.
Glued to one hand.
Telephone glued to the other.
You see what he did?
He sliced her up.
Then he bandaged her.
Call for help and you'll live.
But you'll be disfigured.
Or put yourself out of your own misery.
Come on.
He cut off her nose.
To spite her face.
And he did it very recently.
Listen...
I've decided to stay on till this is done.
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe... or he'll kill 7 and this case will never end.
Don't do me any favors. Thank you, but I got it.
I'm asking to be your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me a favor.
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.
Detective?
After this I'm gone.
- No big surprise.
- Detective!
You're looking for me.
Don't fucking move.
On the floor.
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.
I know you.
Now. Get down.
Get down on your stomach.
You piece of shit. Now!
All the way. All the way... fucker. Down.
Faster.
Faster, fucker. Now.
Nose on the ground.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.
Goddamn it.
He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers. That's why we couldn't... find 1 print in his apartment.
Seems he's done that for a while.
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?
So far everything is a dead end.
No credit history.
No employment records.
A 5-year old bank account opened with cash.
We've tried tracing his furniture.
All we know about him... is that he's independently wealthy... well-educated... and totally insane.
Because he's John Doe by choice.
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.
There he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.
He's not finished.
He's pissing in our faces and we're taking it.
You know what I'm saying.
For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement.
He wouldn't just stop.
So what the fuck, man?
He's 2 murders away from completing his masterpiece.
We'll wait for his plea.
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them... and only at 6 o'clock today.
Why us?
He says he admires you.
It's part of the game.
If they don't accept this offer, these bodies will never be found.
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.
We've got him.
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.
He'll get his free room and board, cable TV.
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit... and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.
I don't like it.
The law requires me to serve... my clients and their interests as best I can.
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.
My client informs you that... if you do not accept, he'll plead insanity.
Let him try it.
I'd like to see it.
We know with the extreme nature of these crimes I'd get him off... with such a plea.
I won't let this conviction slide.
If you do accept under his specific conditions, he'll sign... a full confession, plead guilty right now.
It's your case.
Make a decision.
Full confession.
I'm in.
It must be both of you.
If he were to claim insanity... this conversation is admissible.
That he's blackmailing us with his plea.
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.
The press'd love to find out the police weren't concerned... about finding and burying them.
If in fact there are 2 more dead.
The lab report came.
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.
They found blood from Doe's fingers, blood from... the woman who's face he cut off, and blood from... a third party... as yet unidentified.
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.
Let's finish it.
If John Doe's head splits open and a UFO flies out...
I want you to expect it.
I will.
If I accidentally shaved off a nipple, would it be covered by workman's comp?
I suppose so.
If you were man enough to file a claim...
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.
I keep coming home late, my wife'll think something's up.
You know...
Yeah.
What?
Will this wind hurt us?
Who are you, John?
Who are you really?
What do you mean?
At this stage, what harm can it do to tell us about yourself?
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.
Stay on your left up here.
Where are we heading?
You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?
That wouldn't be shocking enough.
You've got newspapers to think about, yeah?
Wanting people to listen... you can't just... tap them on the shoulder anymore.
You have to use a sledgehammer.
Then you'll get their strict attention.
But the question is:
Why're you so special that people should listen?
I'm not special.
I've never been exceptional.
This is, though. What I'm doing.
My work.
Your work, John?
Yes.
See, I don't see anything special about it, John.
That's not true.
No, it is true. And the funny thing is, all this work... in 2 months, no one'll care, or give a shit, or even remember.
You can't see the whole complete act yet.
But when this is done... when it's finished... it's going to be...
People will barely be able to comprehend.
But they won't be able to deny.
Could the freak be more vague?
As far as master plans go...
I really can't wait for you to see.
It's going to be something.
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.
So when this thing happens, be sure and let me know.
Don't want to miss it.
Oh, don't worry.
You won't.
You won't miss a thing.
What's so exciting?
It's not too far now.
I've tried to figure something in my head. Maybe you can help me out.
When a person is insane, as you clearly are, do you know... that you're insane?
Maybe you're reading... masturbating in your own feces...
Do you just stop and go:
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?
You know? Do you guys do that?
It's more comfortable for you to label me insane.
It's very comfortable.
It's not something I would expect you to accept.
But I did not choose. I was chosen.
Whatever.
I don't doubt that you believe that. but it seems that you're... overlooking a contradiction.
Meaning what?
Glad you asked.
If you were chosen... that is, by a higher... power... and if your hand was forced... it seems strange to me that you'd get such enjoyment.
You enjoyed torturing those people.
That doesn't seem to fit with martyrdom, does it?
John?
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me... in a room without windows.
Isn't that true?
How'd you like to...
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.
I would never.
You wouldn't only because there's consequences.
It's in those eyes of yours, though.
Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.
I won't deny my own personal desire... to turn each sin against the sinner.
Wait a minute, I thought all you did was kill innocent people.
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?
An obese man.
Disgusting man who could barely stand.
You'd point him out to your friends so that they'd join you in mocking him.
If you saw him while you ate, you couldn't finish your meal.
Then the lawyer. You had to secretly thank me for that.
This is a man who dedicated his life... to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keep... murderers and rapists...
- on the streets.
- Murderers?
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman... so ugly inside that she couldn't go on living... if she couldn't be beautiful outside?
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget... the disease-spreading whore.
Only in a world this shitty... could you say they were innocent and keep a straight face.
But that's the point.
We see a deadly sin on every street corner... in every home and we... tolerate it.
We tolerate it because it's common.
It's trivial.
We tolerate it morning, noon and night.
Well, not anymore.
I'm setting the example.
And what I've done will be... puzzled over... and studied... and followed... forever.
Yeah.
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
Why's that, John?
Because you'll be remembered after this.
Realize, Detective, the only reason that I'm here now... is that I wanted to be.
No. We would have got you eventually.
Oh, really?
So what were you doing, biding your time? Toying with me?
Allowing 5 "innocent" people to die until... you felt like springing your trap?
What was the indisputable... evidence you were going to use on me, right before...
I walked up to you and put my hands in the air?
John. Calm down.
I remember us knocking on your door.
That's right.
And I seem to remember breaking your face.
You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Okay. Sit back.
- I spared you.
- Sit back.
Remember that when you look in the mirror... for the rest of your life... or should I say for the rest of what life I allow you... to have.
Sit back, you fucking freak!
Shut your fucking mouth!
You're no messiah. You're a movie of the week. A fucking tee shirt... at best.
Don't ask me to pity those people.
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.
Is that to say, John, that what you were doing was God's good work?
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Do you see those high-tension towers?
That's where we're headed.
I see it. 9 o'clock, and follow that road.
There sure as shit is no ambush out here.
No fucking nothing out here.
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.
I want you to go way up.
In thirty seconds, bank east on my mark. Thirty seconds.
I'll get him.
Get out.
Slowly.
Stop.
Stay.
What do you got?
A dead dog.
I didn't do that.
What time is it?
Why?
I'd like to know.
It's close.
Let's go take a look.
It's this way.
Down. Down. Down.
Watch him.
There he goes.
It's good we have some time to talk.
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.
A van's coming down the road.
From the north.
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.
Get out!
Out!
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.
Step away.
Turn around. Hands on your head.
What's going on?
Why are you here?
I'm delivering a package for this guy, David.
Detective...
David Mills.
Get it. Slowly.
A guy paid me $500 to bring it out here.
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.
Put it down.
We got a box.
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.
Bomb squad. We got a box.
Face the van.
Hands up.
Turn.
Okay. Go.
Off you go. Go.
I'm sending the driver out on foot.
He's headed north, along the road.
Have him picked up.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm going to open it.
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.
It's blood.
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
California, stay away from here.
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.
Whatever you hear, stay away.
John Doe has the upper hand.
Here he comes.
- Throw your gun down!
- What?
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Do you hear me, Detective?
I'm trying to tell you how much...
I admire you and your pretty wife.
What?
Tracy.
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing... how easily a member of the press can purchase... information from the men in your precinct.
What the fuck?
Throw your gun down!
I visited your home this morning... after you left.
I tried to play husband.
I tried to taste the life of a simple man.
Throw it away!
It didn't work out.
So...
I took a souvenir.
Her pretty head.
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.
What's goin' on over there?
Would you... Put the gun down.
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?
Because I envy your normal life.
Put the gun down, David.
It seems that envy is my sin.
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.
What's in the fucking box?
He just told you.
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.
She's all right. You tell me.
Become... wrath.
Tell me she's all right!
If you murder a suspect, David... you just throw it all away and he knows it.
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!
She begged for her life... and for the life of the baby inside of her.
He didn't know.
Give me the gun, David.
If you kill him... he will win.
Oh God!
Oh God!
Well, we'll take care of him.
Whatever he needs.
Where you gonna be?
Around.
I'll be around.
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:
The world is a fine place and worth fighting for."
I agree with the second part.
-Hang on, Tommy.
-Just climb down. l'm scared. l can't move.
-What if he dies?
-l'm not telling his mom.
-Look. lt's Superman.
-Tommy, Superman's coming.
-He's gonna help.
-lt's okay now. l've got you.
All right. Who wants to explain what you were doing up there?
-They dared me.
-We didn't think you'd do it. l know it's tough to turn down a dare...
...but sometimes being brave means using your head...
...not doing something dangerous because others pressure you.
You're right, Superman. l'll be smarter next time.
Yeah. Thanks, Superman.
Okay, then. Bye-bye.
-What a dork.
-ls not.
-Of course he is, with that corny speech.
-Be quiet. He's not.
-Little whiner.
-Shut up.
-Hey, Superman.
-We love you, big guy.
Get your hands up!
-Take a wrong step, Mr. Kent?
-What?
Clark!
Thanks. Superman.
Maybe you two should leave the dirty work to the authorities.
-l....
-Yeah, right.
Have you ever known me to play it safe? l suppose not.
We should have a word about that.
Maybe over dinner?
Fine with me. Eight o'clock?
-Meet you on the roof of the Planet.
-lt's a date.
A date?
Must be this new perfume.
-Hey, Smallville. You all right?
-Yeah.
A little shaken up, l guess.
You go on ahead, Lois, l feel like walking it off.
Are you nuts?
We're miles from nowhere.
What about the story?
You know us country bumpkins.
Ten miles to school and all that.
Your loss. My byline.
Thanks, Superman.
We're okay from here.
Excuse me. l know you're a busy guy, but l am dying to get your autograph.
Okay, who are you? What's the game?
There's no point keeping up the act with me.
-The question is, who are you?
-Let me guess.
This is all a distraction to keep me busy. lf you say so. But l should warn you, your makeup's rubbing off.
This-- This is a trick.
How are you doing this? Answer me!
Whoever you are, you don't look so good.
Leave me alone. l have a problem.
My friend, l would call that an understatement.
But he looked like me. l no understand. lt's all right. Calm down.
How? How could he? l'm Superman.
Me.
-Me.
-What's happening to him?
-Why isn't he following my orders?
-l warned you.
The alien DNA was unlike anything we'd cloned before. lt must be breaking down. l say we abort.
Activate the auto-destruct.
Get rid of them all while we can.
We're not scrapping the project for one glitch.
Take this opportunity to learn, doctor.
Study him for the sake of the others.
Come. Let's look you over.
What going on?
Me am Superman.
Yes. Yes, of course you are.
At least his programmed memories are holding.
Although the damage has clearly affected some parts of his brain.
No kidding.
What am me?
Bizarro, that's what you am.
Mercy.
-Bizarro? That not my name.
-lf the shoe fits, handsome.
No, me am Superman. Me am hero.
Me show you.
That's coming out of your pay.
There. Me save building.
Don't ask me. l just catch them.
Me fix bridge. That prove me Superman.
-What the heck is he doing?
-l can't slow it in time, sir. lt not break again.
No!
You am no Superman.
Me am Superman. You leave me alone.
So now l'm ruining his day. l wasn't sure you'd really come.
Me remember.
Me need Lois help.
Don't be afraid.
Me never hurt you. l heard about our date, Lois.
Problem is, you made it with the wrong guy. lmposter.
Stay back, Lois.
Me protect you.
Lois.
Don't worry. Me save Lois.
Me always save Lois. Me hero.
Me have memories.
Me know am Superman...
...but other Superman make me confused.
Me come to Lois because Lois friend. l had a late lunch.
Which l'm about to lose.
So, Superman, tell me about these memories.
What is it you remember?
Girl at lab call me Bizarro, but that not right.
Me am Superman.
-Did you say lab?
-ln mountain, where me born.
Me show Lois.
Me like take Lois for ride.
Sure.
But use the door this time.
Okay.
This am home.
Cozy.
Oh, my God.
This is some kind of cloning operation.
Someone's making duplicates of Superman.
Not someone.
Me. lt was a freak dressed as Superman.
He burst in here with a woman and scared everyone away.
They just sat there for a few minutes and then they took off.
But that not right.
Me am Superman.
Did you say lab?
In mountain, where me born.
What direction were they headed? l trust you remember Superman's run-in with a mechanical dinosaur?
How could l forget?
He was so weak from the Kryptonite, our ''Man of Steel'' actually bled.
My technicians collected a few drops from the floor...
...and from that humble beginning, we have this.
Your own army of Supermen.
All programmed to answer to me.
A charming image, except for this...
...technical difficulty.
No.
Them no Superman.
Me am Superman.
Me am hero.
Sorry, my friend, but you am toast.
No!
Since it's too late to save the others, we should clean house.
Engage the auto-destruct.
Mercy, start the chopper.
There. We've got two minutes.
You can't just leave him like this.
You're welcome to stay.
Though l wouldn't advise it.
Decide quickly, Lois.
The ride leaves now.
Where think you going?
You not get away from Superman.
Now, no one leave.
He's destroyed the terminal. l can't cancel the auto-destruct.
Superman, we've gotta get out.
You.
Me kill you.
She meant now, Superman. We're sitting on top of a half kiloton of explosives.
Enough, l presume, to destroy even you.
Now. Run!
Superman.
Superman save Lois?
My leg.
Me hold.
You go.
Me no am Superman.
You am Superman.
Superman, save Lois.
You are a hero.
Do you think he survived? l don't know. l've never been in a half-kiloton blast. l hope he did.
He turned out to have a good heart.
Well, naturally.
He came from good stock.
[ENGLlSH]
Hi, l'm Angela Chen.
Tonight, a new segment on Metropolis Edition:
''Profiles in lnfamy:
Where are they now?''
This evening, we spotlight
John Corben, also known as Metallo.
Who can forget his epic battle with Superman exactly one year ago?
This is the last known recording of the metal monster...
...who was later lost at sea.
But is he rusting on the ocean floor or just resting?
Out of my way, Quantam Rider!
This is the last of your evil treachery!
Stupid volcano.
Can l play?
Go play with your dolls.
Fine. l'll go buy my own action figures.
On this island? l don't think so.
Stupid island. Stupid brother.
Sarita? lt's a monster!
Sarita!
-Are you all right?
-l think so.
-That was cool.
-You saved my life.
Who are you? l don't know.
-You don't know your own name?
-Hush up, Sarita.
What are you?
Where are you from?
Not sure.
He's lost. He has no place to go.
Can we keep him? l suppose. lf he doesn't belong to anybody.
He does now. l'm gonna call you Tinman.
Tinman? Give me a break.
-l found him.
-Look at him. He's big.
He's strong. Like Superman.
Superman?
Steelman. Like the Man of Steel.
That's what we'll call you.
What do you think?
Bobby!
Look. lt's gonna fall!
You gotta save him.
Oh, my gosh.
What?
-Steelman, let's go!
-Come on.
Hey, did you guys read this?
A trucker up in Raknaveek says he was saved by a robot.
Peddle it to Angela, kid.
She covers the wackos.
Say, Perry, about this robot story. l was thinking...
-...you might wanna send somebody--
-He is.
Afraid Lois beat you to it.
-That's becoming your mantra, isn't it?
-You think it's Metallo too, don't you?
Let's just say things could get hotter on the island of Raknaveek...
...and l'm not talking volcanoes.
Hi, professor. l'm going on a little trip and thought l'd bring a change of clothes.
There's a juicer, a granola bar, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich...
...and some grapes. l told you he wouldn't eat that stuff.
Listen, Steelman, we gotta get back to our dad...
...but we'll see you in the morning. Okay?
Wait.
Here's something l made for you, in case you get lonely.
-Sarita!
-l'm coming.
Superman! l'll be at the observation site all day, so don't wander too far.
-lf the volcano should erupt--
-Yeah, yeah. We know. Come right home.
Now, listen to me. The pressure's building faster than we thought.
-We could be evacuating any time.
-But.... l thought you'd be happy to get off this stupid old island.
Come on.
Was he wearing a costume? A cape?
Did he say or do anything unusual?
He pulled me out of a burning truck. l'd call that unusual.
And he didn't say nothing.
He just ran off with a couple of kids.
Hey, l'm not making this up. l tell you, they were kids. l've started to remember everything.
You see, l'm-- l'm from another planet. l knew it.
Yes. l came here to deliver an important message to the leaders of your world.
But there are bad people who want to stop me. l'll need a disguise to get off the island safely.
The fate of the whole galaxy is at stake.
You can count on us, Steelman.
Hey, what about Dad's old coat?
This should fit him.
Sarita and Bobby, right?
-Who are you?
-My name is Lois Lane. l'm a newspaper reporter. l'd just like to ask you a few questions.
-About what?
-About that robot.
The one that saved that trucker's life a few days ago?
Someone said you might have been there.
They lied. l'll just put that down as a ''no comment.''
Truth is, Superman, most of us are so tied up in this project...
-...we wouldn't notice a flying cow.
-l only ask because the robot...
-...was seen not far from your--
-Hold on.
Collins! Get over here.
Look at that sonar gauge.
This can't be right.
She's not due to erupt for--
Good Lord!
-You're evacuating?
-You bet.
That little shakeup was just a preamble.
Yes. You did well.
My pursuers will never recognize me.
-l think we met one of them.
-What?
A lady. She was asking questions about you.
-You didn't tell her anything?
-No, of course not.
-You're hurting me.
-You did the right thing.
But we have to be careful.
These people can be tricky.
Very tricky.
Lois Lane. l'd give you a kiss if l still had my lips.
Let go of me, you walking waffle iron.
Now, now. Not in front of the children.
The evacuation alarm.
Hold on a second.
Okay, hit it.
Thanks, Superman!
Bobby! Sarita! Bobby!
-What's wrong?
-My kids. They must be in the woods.
They're supposed to head back here the minute they hear the alarm.
You're not going to get away with this, Corben.
Ms. Lane, please. Such cliches.
How did you ever win that Pulitzer?
Let's go.
We can't just leave her here. She'll die.
So what? She deserves it.
Superman wouldn't let anyone die, no matter how bad they were. l'm not Superman. lt's him! lsn't it?
Nice space suit.
When l'm done with you, you'll wish you were on the moon. lt won't work this time.
We have to get these kids out of here now.
Get going!
What are they doing?
Why are they fighting?
We got our own problems, kid.
Have a drink on me, Superman.
Steelman, no!
Don't do it, Steelman!
Steelman? Steelman is dead.
And so are you, Superman.
No!
Hang on.
How could Steelman do those things?
We thought he was good.
He was, while he was with you.
Whatever goodness he had, though, got buried along with the rest of him.
It's so still and dark.
No sound.
No light.
Nothingness.
My mind. I cannot let it drift.
I must remember.
I am Metallo.
I am Metallo.
[ENGLlSH]
Nominees for lnvestigative Journalism are Patrice Bandi...
...for her article on illegal drug traffic.
Mike Hart for his expose on diet fraud.
Julian Frey for his piece,
''No Profit Like Nonprofit.''
Good luck, Julian.
And Lois Lane for ''Lex-Scam: Nuclear Danger.''
You too, my dear.
And the award goes to....
Lois Lane.
Lois, go up.
-Did you hear that?
-Yes, l can hardly believe it, either.
As if her ego weren't big enough already.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Metropolis Press, colleagues...
...l'd like to thank the Excalibur Committee for nominating my work.
l would also like to thank the members of the Daily Planet Editorial Department...
...and the entire support staff for their invaluable help locating...
...and compiling the data for this article. l would also like to congratulate my fellow nominees.
Oh, please.
Better go wash this out before it stains.
When corruption or waste or fraud is uncovered, we all win.
Thank you, all. l will treasure--
-What's going on?
-l think she's all right.
How did that happen?
-Some kind of electro-gizmo.
-lt looks like it's got a--
When did you join the force?
This is police business.
When we have information, you'll get it along with all the other reporters. l'm not just one of the other reporters.
This was an attempt on my life, you know.
You really want to be helpful?
Try making a list of all the people who might wanna see you dead...
...and try to keep it to one page.
What do you think the chances are of Bowman actually solving this case?
-What's his problem?
-Oh, about two years ago...
...l wrote an expose on police corruption. lt cost him a promotion.
-He's had it in for me ever since.
-Careful!
Don't worry, Kent. l'm always in control. lf you want, l'd be happy to stay at your apartment tonight.
-Somebody did try to kill you.
-And he failed.
Look, Kent, l'm not worried.
You shouldn't be either.
And now, a very special request. ls there anything else on?
Paldoverdi's version of
''You Win, You Die. ''
-lt won't change.
-Dedicated to Lois Lane.
Yes, Lois, you.
What a shame that an innocent party like Mr. Kent must also suffer...
...but you never were one to let an innocent stand in your way.
-What are you doing?
-Getting us out of here.
Clark!
Clark!
Oh, no, you don't, Lois.
-Are you all right?
-Yes, but Clark--
He's fine. l was able to cushion his fall.
A little something for your insurance agent.
-Arm still hurting?
-About the same as yesterday. l still think we should have taken it to the police first.
Oh, yeah. l'm sure Detective Bowman won't rest until he finds out...
...where this came from.
At least l know
Edward Lytener will be helpful.
-Yes, yes. What is it?
-Oh, yes. Very helpful, l'm sure. lt's me, Eddie. Lois.
Lois. Lois Lane. Of course. Of course. l wouldn't. Ten gigawatts.
Real nasty shock.
-l'm really sorry to bother you like this.
-No bother. l've been in this lab 24 hours straight without looking up. l could use the break, and the company.
The circuit patterns are like what they're working on over at LexCorp R&D.
-How do you know that?
-Eddie used to work for Luthor.
He was my informant on the ''Lex-Scam'' article.
-By the way, Lois. Congratulations.
-Yeah, thanks.
Hello. What's this?
L.C. lt's from LexCorp, all right. Somebody there must really have it in for you, Lois.
Another in a long line of killing machines. lt's not as much fun when you're on the receiving end. l heard about the regrettable incident at the Excalibur Awards.
Yes, and this little goodie was in my car. l have evidence it was manufactured here, at LexCorp.
Really, Lois. l wouldn't leave so blatant a trail...
...even if l were out to get you.
-And you're not?
-No. Why would l be? l respect you and what you do...
...even when you're taking potshots at my company.
-But the device--
-This disturbs me as much as it does you. lf it came from LexCorp, l'll find out how it ended up in your car. l promise. Trust me, Lois.
Trust him? Why would you do that?
He's trying to keep you from nosing around LexCorp.
Probably. But l believed him when he said he wasn't behind it.
The way this assassin keeps warning me...
...it's like he wants me to suffer first.
That's weird, but it's not Lex.
Lois, my dear. Perry has just handed me some of your overdue assignments.
-What?
-He was worried about you falling behind. l certainly hope l can come up to your award-winning standards. l'm sure you will.
Great.
You're not safe, Lois.
Not outside, not in your car.
Not even here at work.
I'll give you exactly one minute to prepare to meet your maker. l believe this is your floor. l'm not having a good day. l just hate this. l can't sleep, l can't eat. l feel so helpless.
-Why don't you just relax?
-I can't relax. l feel like l should be out there doing something, not sitting here...
...wondering what everybody else is up to. lt feels wrong.
Why? Let other people take the risks for you for a change.
The world can get by without Lois Lane for a couple of days.
Yeah, just enough time for Julian to steal all my stories and my byline.
Oh, by the way, Angela Chen called.
She heard about your award on the news last night...
-...and wanted to congratulate you.
-On the news, huh?
You know, Clark, maybe you're right.
-Let everyone else take care of things.
-That's the spirit. ln fact, l think l'll go relax in a nice, hot bath.
Right now. See you. l got a couple more hours.
But my shift will be over by 1 0.
-Maybe we could get together.
-Okay. lf we put our heads together we could figure out who's behind this.
Of course, l hate to be taking you away from your work again.
Not at all, Lois. l'm happy to help in any way l can.
By the way, what were you working on so hard the other night?
Top-secret.
You certainly have the most amazing collection of gadgets...
-...but no TV, no radio?
-Never.
They're a wasteland of call-in drivel and news trivia. lt would just break my concentra--
What is it?
-You know, don't you?
-Know what?
Tell me, Lois.
How did you figure it out?
You congratulated me on my award, remember? lf you were in this lab all night with no TV, no radio...
...then how did you know l'd won the Excalibur?
Such a clever girl.
-Hello?
-Kent. l was hoping to speak to Lois.
-She's not here.
-Then take a note. l've traced the materials she was asking about. lt was part of a lot that went missing from inventory...
...right after her little snitch,
Lytener, was fired.
Did you get that, Kent? Hello?
Hello?
Eddie, why are you doing this?
What have l ever done to you?
That's just it.
You never did anything for me...
...and l risked it all.
My job, my reputation, my research. l knew what would happen if Lex found out.
You blew the whistle because it was the right thing.
Wrong. l blew the whistle because l wanted you to notice me.
You didn't. But you will now.
Daddy was a black belt.
You're an unusual woman, Lois.
That's why l've taken unusual measures.
A trap l designed for your apartment. See, you wouldn't have been safe anywhere.
Superman! l was expecting you to show up.
After all, if Lois Lane is in danger, can Superman be far behind?
Let her out of there!
You're in no position to make demands, Superman.
Let her out or l'll--
This is my favorite invention.
A project l began at Lexlabs, actually. lt's powered by the solar energy spectrum of a red sun.
That's why the punches pack such a wallop.
Particularly for you, Superman.
Superman! The controls!
-Are you okay?
-A little extra-crispy...
...but otherwise fine.
Tell me something.
How do you always manage to arrive just in the nick of time?
-lt's a gift.
-You wouldn't be keeping...
...an eye on me or anything?
Well, some people need more watching than others.
Thanks.
Someday, though, it'd be nice to see you when l wasn't about to be killed.
Someday.
[ENGLlSH]
McGurk! McGurk! Where are you?
Look at that crazy little man.
He'll be killed.
Hey, McGurk, l'm losing my patience here!
Confusing, ain't it?
What's so funny, Jimmy?
Check out the new comic strip.
-What a riot.
-Mr. Mixel-plick?
No! Repeat after me, bright boy. lt's mix, ''yezz'' ...
...spit, lick.
Hey, have you seen McGurk?
McGurk!
Hold it.
-Did you see him?
-Who?
That weird little man.
He was right here.
Yeah. Do me a favor, Kent.
Crack up after we've covered the museum opening.
-And now we are proud to present--
-McGurk!
Oh, no.
This classic sculpture by one of the world's most noted artists.
McGurk!
Where are you, McGurk?
Come on, it's getting late.
How do you like that guy?
Standing me up like this.
-Be quiet.
-Listen, you--
What is he doing here? lf we may continue?
And here now at last...
...the showpiece of our exhibit:
Rodin's Thinker.
That's him! Hey, McGurk.
Finish your business and let's get going.
Oh, sorry, Mix.
Hold it right there, little friend. l want some answers.
McGurk, get rid of this bum.
You heard my pal.
Scram! lf that's the way you wanna play it.
Superman?
He's ruined the statue! l didn't mean-- Sorry. lt was the little man. lt's been going on all week. lmpossible things keep happening and l'm the only one...
...who ever sees them. Am l going nuts?
Oh, Clark, l'm sure it's not as bad as that. l can't go on being Superman if l keep flipping out.
Now, take it easy, son.
There's a perfectly logical explanation for all this.
Yes. lt's obvious a brilliant, godlike life form from a dimension...
...twice removed from ours is testing your powers.
What makes you say that?
That's not important, Clark.
What really matters...
...is following through with a nice firm peck when scratching up corn.
Ma? Pa?
No.
Chickens are always funny.
Though personally, l prefer ducks.
Or ostriches.
Or just for the sake of novelty.... l've never seen those before.
Bring them back. Do it!
Take it easy. The folks are okay.
We'll just put them up there for safekeeping.
-Who are you?
-Like Mummy said...
...l'm a superior being from the fifth dimension.
What do you want with me?
Laughs. You see, for centuries now...
...l've been pitting my interdimensional magic...
...against schmoes who thought they could go 1 5 rounds with the old master.
You know the stories about genies, imps and leprechauns?
-You?
-Guilty.
After a while, l became bored with your basic rank-and-file human dolts...
...but then you showed up.
Superman!
You, my friend, are the ultimate challenge.
We're gonna have many merry games, you and l.
A game has rules.
Your stunts are just random idiocy.
Okay, l'll give you a rule.
You make me say, spell or otherwise reveal my name backwards...
...and l'll split until our dimensions come into alignment again...
...in about, oh, three months, give or take. l can't even say your name forward.
How am l supposed to say it backward?
No, dope.
You don't have to say it backward.
You have to get me to say it.
-Say what?
-Kltpzyxm!
Gosh, you're thick.
Now, for the last time--
Nuts.
Clark? Dear?
Did something just happen?
No. What's for dinner?
Hi, guy.
Your three months are up...
...and this time you're not gonna cheat me out of my fun.
Oh, it's you again, Mr. Kltpzyxm.
Not Kltpzyxm, Mxyzptlk.
Now, the first thing l'm gonna do--
Oh, nuts.
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Look, little guy. l'm tired of this. lf it's a fight you want--
Oh, it is. lt is.
Fine. But first let me proofread this article and l'll meet you on the roof...
-...in 20 minutes.
-No stalling. l'll edit the rag for you.
There. Hey. What? No!
You're getting sloppy, Smallville.
This sentence is loaded with typos.
''K, L, T, P, Z....''
Nuts! Nuts! Nuts!
He beat you again, huh?
Don't start with me, Gsptlsnz! l've only got 90 days until my next bout with that caped clod.
How does he do it?
-Mxy, l wore this new outfit just for you.
-No time for love, babe.
Gotta beat Superman.
Gotta beat Superman.
Oh, Mxy, l don't like the way...
...you're obsessing over this Superman person.
Using our powers to torment humans is so three-dimensional.
Got to beat Superman! lf he upsets you that much, why don't you just...
-...oh, l don't know, destroy him.
-Hey, that's it.
Next time l'll finish him off before he can trick me.
Thanks, Gspie. Love you.
Yeah, yeah. Lucky me.
Now you're gonna get it.
Oh, yeah.
You'll be crying early today, boy.
Bye, Gspie. Don't wait up.
Five, four, three--
Nuts! Nuts! Nuts!
Not one word.
Don't you look happy.
What's wrong? Bad news?
You could say that. l'm expecting a visitor from out of town.
Guy's kind of a pest, is he?
The worst. l hear you.
Every time my sister visits...
...she just moves right on in and stays and stays and--
Was that a penguin? l'm afraid so.
Here we go.
Wow, look at all the animals.
This is really weird.
You're fast, kiddo.
Hiya, Super. Looks like you've joined the horsy set.
What's it gonna take to get rid of you? Forever.
You always trick me into doing that name thing once...
...but this time you're going to have to make me do it twice in a row.
Which means l can say
Kltpzyxm all l want...
...as long as l break it, Kltpzyxm, up.
lf you beat me, then l'm history.
Gone, finito. Bye-bye.
But if l win.... l got me a new stableboy. Deal?
Whatever you want. l quit.
You don't mean it?
Oh, yes, l do. Shut off the lights when you're done, will you?
Hey, hey. You can't just walk out. lf you do, your friends will stay mindless beasts.
They don't seem to mind.
Don't get tough with me, little boy blue. lf you don't cooperate, l'll tell the world your secret.
Blab your head off. l'll find another disguise.
You can't outfly me.
-Watch me.
-Oh, yeah?
Banzai!
No fair.
You wanna play hardball? Fine!
Hey, Super, get a load of me.
The ultimate smart bomb, complete with a Kryptonite warhead.
Good try, blue, but not good enough.
What's the matter, Super?
Feeling the heat? l won! l won! ln your face, Superman.
No, loser. ln yours.
Oh, shoot my monkey. l skywrote my own name.
Backwards.
-Twice.
-You were just toying with me...
...the whole time. Even from the start.
Pretty much, yeah.
Never had you fooled for a second.
-Sorry.
-You were the superior being all along.
-Well....
-And now l'm gone. Gone forever.
You look happy. What's up? l was expecting a visitor from out of town, but he can't make it.
-The guy's kind of a pest, is he?
-Not anymore.
Guests are the worst.
Every time my sister visits, she just moves right on in...
...and stays and stays and....
Why am l eating this?
Oh, you. You. l'm not done with you.
Not by a long shot. l'll find a loophole. Somehow, someday!
You know, now that you're stuck here...
...you'll just have to find some other way to pass the time.
Hey, this isn't so bad.
[ENGLlSH]
Hey! You blind?
''No electronic equipment.''
Your watch. You forgot to take it off. l guess l did. Sorry.
Hey, Mr. Clean.
Yo, Rapmaster Danny?
Hey, stupid. l love a man who knows his limitations.
-What are you listening to?
-My Walkman.
Sounded like Voodoo Connection.
Oh, l'd sure like to hear a cut off of their new album. l don't think so. l'm not even supposed to be talking to you.
Yeah? You're not even supposed to be listening to music, but you are.
Wait, don't go. Talk to me. lt's so boring in here, so lonely. l've been waiting for someone like you to come along.
Someone to help me shake things up a little.
What do you want me to do?
How about a little music for Livewire?
Just to get me in the mood.
Sure. Why not?
Thanks, Danny boy. That's all l needed.
Hey, these batteries are dead.
Let's see if they're rechargeable.
Lights out.
-Hey.
-Hey, who was that?
-You crazy?
-Hey, look out!
Later, chumps.
And as l've told Superman, the S.C.U. will be mobilized within the hour...
...and ready to move out at a moment's notice.
-Dan.
-Hey, Turp. lnspector. ls the S.C.U. really prepared to deal with Livewire? lf that short circuit shows her mug anywhere in this town...
-...l will personally--
-Pucker up and plant a big wet one...
...right on her lips.
What is that?
-Oh, my God, it's her.
-lt's her, it's Livewire.
Now, where's my real date?
Looking for me, Livewire?
Well-timed, Superjerk. Let's rock!
You're just delaying the inevitable,
Superman.
What do you want?
That's right.
Let's get to the heart of the matter. l want justice. l want revenge. l want your life.
Why won't you die?
Not this time, Superjerk, but l'll be back...
...and next time, l'll find a way to take you out. Permanently.
Okay, folks. Let's see if he'll--
By golly, he's really doing it.
He's drinking milk out of his owner's mouth.
Rudy.
Is this the bone they threw you?
A big TV?
How would you like to have some real laughs?
Poor little Parasite. l've been where you are.
Locked away in a cell.
All alone, no one to see.
No one to touch...
...and all because of Superman.
Superman.
But we could take care of him, you and l.
And then when we're done, maybe l'll give you a little taste...
...of my power, l mean.
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.
-Oh, baby!
-Hey, good-looking.
-Come on to my house--
-Come to me, baby.
Over here, come here, kid. l'm the one.
Hi, boys. Wanna make sparks fly?
-Zap me, honey.
-Charge me up, baby.
-Try me, Live. l'm battery-powered.
-Right over here.
-Right over here, kid.
-Here, here. l just keep going and going and going....
What the--?
Don't play with your food, now.
-Do you know how to pilot one of those?
-Not yet, but l'm a fast learner.
-You know where to go.
-Ain't you coming? l don't do boats.
-Too loud for you?
-No, it's just that every time...
...l see something electric, l keep thinking she's gonna pop out.
That sounds like it's coming from Stryker's. l better find a phone.
Here, we can use mine.
Clark?
Clark?
Superman.
Sorry, Rudy. l'm canceling your early release.
Oh, no, you don't.
Give it up, Rudy.
You're only hurting yourself.
So that's the plan, my purple people-eater. l force Superman into your grip, then you drain away his powers...
...leaving him just conscious enough to watch me deliver the final blow.
You smell like fish.
So? Hold your nose.
You can look, but don't touch.
Don't be afraid. l know how to control my power.
That's what they all say.
You stupid sleaze. l'm pure electricity,
1 86,000 miles per second. lf l say no, it means no.
Now, don't stay up too late, Rudster.
Remember, we gotta stay charged for the S-man.
How do you like this?
The fun couple makes the front page even when they're lying low.
How's it look out there? lt's gonna get worse before it gets better.
Well, l'm going over to S.C.U. Headquarters anyway.
See if Maggie Sawyer can give me more than the official line.
-Wanna come?
-No, l think l'll just stay....
What?
All right, maybe it's not the latest word in rainwear...
...but nothing beats a plain old plastic poncho. lt won't take long for the cops to get here, even less for Blue Boy.
Just enough time to juice up.
Knock it off. Can't you see l'm eating?
Look, Rudy. Dessert.
Get him!
Hey, he's covered.
Well, what do you know?
The boy scout brought protection.
-That ain't fair.
-l didn't realize there were rules.
Tear it off.
Rudy. The tank!
Super sorbet.
Do not use if plastic seal is broken.
That's it. Drain him!
Not too much, idiot. l want him left standing. l know what l'm doing.
Yeah, Blue Boy, this has been a long time coming.
Get ready to snap, crackle and pop.
Hey, what do you think you're--? l want him alive so l can keep feeding off him, and you too.
You've said no to me for the last time, baby.
Oh, no, you don't.
Hey, Superman, or should l call you Clark? l remember now. ln fact, l remember everything about you.
How's that pretty little colleague of yours?
Lois, right? l was gonna do this nicely, but give him an inch....
The janitor's closet.
A dead end, Superman.
Believe me, l know.
Oh, now l'm scared.
No!
You bungling idiot!
We could have had it all.
All. Look at me, you dolt.
This is the face that's going to destroy you.
You hear me, eggplant?
Don't waste your breath, Sparky.
Parasite don't even know who he is. lt's a good bet he ain't gonna remember you.
-Do you think he'll ever remember?
-He's oatmeal.
You need a lift?
No, thanks. l'm feeling stronger, and it's a nice night for flying.
[ENGLlSH]
Behind the line, Lytener.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
The sunshine is so energizing.
-That's close enough.
-Close enough to what? l'm not even here.
Lytener?
-What happened?
-Get a doctor.
-ls he breathing?
-l don't know.
-Did you see something?
-l don't know.
So long, warden. Thanks for everything.
What the--?
No, that was it. Thanks for clearing up the quote, Your Honor.
-You okay, Clark?
-Yeah, just a little weak, l guess.
Bet it's the weather.
Knocks me right out.
-Clark Kent.
-Kent.
Do me a favor. Cover for me at the Animal Rights Coalition.
-Where are you?
-Heading over to Truman lsland.
Got a tip on Lytener's next move.
What happened to laying low until this guy was caught? lt was driving me nuts is what happened.
And if he takes a shot at you?
Then you'll know who did it.
Lois?
Lytener.
Don't feel bad, Lois.
It's not personal this time.
I have bigger fish to fry now, and frankly, you're just bait.
Oh, yeah, that makes me feel better.
Speak of the devil and here he comes.
Someday, I'll have to figure out how he's always watching over you.
Lois. l can't hang on for long.
The tram's too heavy.
Just wait, Superman.
This is only the beginning.
-Lytener.
-lt's Luminus now.
Tell me, Superman, feeling a little under the weather?
Quick. Give me your hand.
Yes, tend to Lois. This was just a test.
You'll realize what l've done to you in time.
See you soon, even if you don't see me.
-Are you all right?
-l don't know.
What's happening? lt's red.
Naturally, the sun itself is still yellow...
...but we're seeing it through a force field emitted by a series of satellites.
This force field is filtering our sunlight...
...so that only the red wavelengths get through.
Come on, Lex.
Those are your satellites up there and Lytener's worked for you before.
You expect me to believe you have nothing to do with it?
What you believe makes little difference to me.
The fact is, l did provide Lytener resources while behind bars...
...but only for legitimate
LexCorp research. l had no idea he'd escape...
...and l certainly didn't tell him to hijack my satellites for his own revenge.
Heck, why not?
You'd love to see Superman dead.
Oh, please, Lois. Forget that l'm losing millions in communications revenues.
Do you really think l'd jeopardize the welfare of the planet...
...just to settle my personal grudge with Superman?
Check the trades, SEC reports.
See if Luthor's recently unloaded any satellite control equipment. lf Lex is behind Lytener, he'll have covered his tracks...
...put the hardware under another name.
And while you guys are on that...
...l'm gonna check if there's anything down in Microfilm.
Getting weaker, l see.
You must be at what, half strength by now?
Wanna try me?
A hologram.
Maybe this is the real me.
-But then again--
-Maybe it's me.
Or me.
Enough Lytener. What do you want?
-To kill you.
-For getting in my way.
For making a mockery of me and my work.
And how are holograms supposed to kill me?
-Well, we might only be made of light.
-But so are lasers.
One of you is real.
Gotcha.
Testing time's over, Superman.
Next time we meet...
...you die. l just can't figure out what happened to Clark.
-l still think we should've waited for him.
-He snoozes, he loses.
This is the address. ''LexCorp Satellite-Com.
Currently out of use.''
And out of sight.
There's supposed to be a building here.
Look. Up in the sky.
-lt's a bird.
-Yeah, but what's it sitting on?
Come on.
Think l found a doorknob. lt's unlocked? lf you had an invisible door, would you bother to lock it?
Maybe l can find a light.
That better? l can have the rocket operational within the hour.
Good. lf l can shoot a few of those satellites out of the sky...
-...maybe l can let in some real sunlight.
-Sorry, Superman.
No space jaunts for you today.
-Where are they?
-Wanna save them?
All you have to do...
...is follow the bouncing ball.
Superman, you're almost powerless.
He's obviously trying to lure you in.
And doing a good job.
Howdy. l wouldn't bother.
Here's the game, Superman.
Lois and her friend...
...are somewhere in the building.
Find them, and I spare their lives. l don't play games, Lytener.
Oh, come now. After all I went through to remove your powers...
...I do deserve to have a little fun.
Trying to scare me with holograms again?
With the proper use of laser fields, the hologram actually feels quite solid...
...doesn't it?
-Now what?
-Avast there.
Prepare to taste cold steel. lnto the briny with you.
Just as well that you found your way through. l'll enjoy finishing this myself.
How does it feel to be mortal,
Superman?
To know pain? Well, don't worry.
You won't have to endure it for long.
No!
No! l can still finish you off.
Superman, how do you feel?
How did you disable the satellites?
-Yeah, what happened?
-What happened to Miss Lane?
Listen, Superman--
Get those lights out of my eyes.
You heard him.
Put him somewhere nice and dark.

{2255}{2352}Frank, thank God! I'm dead.
{2372}{2422}I'm dead.
{2435}{2596}Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost.|This town is so confusing.
{2664}{2773}What a day.|My wife had to work early.
{2778}{2927}My kid was crying when I took him to|school. He hated to leave Chicago.
{2954}{3069}- It broke my heart, Frank.|- Any more excuses?
{3088}{3198}- No.|- Good. In the future be punctual.
{3203}{3323}- You got it?|- I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
{3683}{3779}- Frank, how are you doing?|- It's good to see you again.
{3784}{3921}- Hi, Marty. Sorry we're late.|- AI, go help Jimmy and Raul.
{3959}{4044}Yeah, sure. This is his.
{4130}{4263}- You don't trust me?|- I live in a crappy neighbourhood.
{4271}{4381}- Have you got that funny money?|- Yeah. Right here.
{4442}{4521}It looks good. It looks real good.
{4555}{4654}- We're in business.|- Excellent.
{4659}{4770}There's just one problem.|This guy Al...
{4775}{4904}He keeps asking all these questions|about my counterfeiter.
{4909}{5011}My instinct usually tells me|when something's wrong.
{5016}{5141}And there's something wrong.|So I had him followed.
{5146}{5239}He's a Secret Service agent, Frank.
{5600}{5748}- What do you think I ought to do?|- Be sure the body doesn't wash up.
{5799}{5877}I want you to pop him for me, okay?
{5921}{6066}- I think maybe you're with him.|- You came to me, remember?
{6071}{6182}- So pop him. Show me I'm an asshole.|- I'm just a businessman.
{6190}{6309}So pop him...|and let's do some business.
{6761}{6953}Yes, that's what I'm looking for.|Come on, let's go get an omelette.
{6997}{7071}Let me get my pistol.
{7076}{7140}My gun?
{7272}{7332}You're under arrest.
{7540}{7619}You're under arrest, too.|Secret Service.
{7690}{7856}You knew from the weight|of the gun that it was empty, right?
{7861}{7963}There could have been|one bullet there.
{8123}{8233}Do you think we can go someplace|and talk about this?
{8489}{8662}- Doesn't killing guys get to you?|- It gets to you.
{8736}{8865}I don't like this undercover stuff.|I was so scared.
{8944}{9030}I joined the Secret Service...
{9081}{9148}...to protect people.
{9164}{9244}You like the idea of|throwing yourself in front of a gun?
{9249}{9351}Hoping you get hit instead of|the guy you're protecting?
{9410}{9516}I don't know. Maybe I'm...
{9580}{9691}- Maybe I'm just wrong for the job.|- You're a good man, Al.
{9696}{9822}- You'll make a good agent.|- How do you know?
{9895}{9967}I know things about people.
{10014}{10174}- Come on, let's eat.|- I've got to go home to my family.
{10179}{10305}A lot of guys warned me|you were a pain in the ass.
{10310}{10405}- I'll see you in the office.|- Damn! The office.
{10410}{10542}- Monroe wants us to check this out.|- I'll take care of it.
{10547}{10662}- I'll go with you.|- No. Go hug your wife and kid.
{10842}{10948}I was not snooping,|but the smoke alarm was going off.
{10953}{11033}I got scared.
{11038}{11173}I got more scared|when I saw what was inside.
{11275}{11386}The smoke was from crumbs|in the oven he left on.
{12044}{12119}31 years I've been in this country.
{12124}{12233}I love the United States.|I've been to the White House.
{12238}{12405}Only in the United States can just|anybody go to visit the President.
{12410}{12526}So when I saw this,|these killing things...
{12536}{12649}...I called the police.|They called the Secret Service.
{12654}{12722}That was two days ago.
{12781}{12923}The President gets 1,400 threats|a year. We've got to check them all.
{13108}{13250}- You say his name's McCauley?|- No, McCrawley, from Denver.
{13340}{13481}I remember it like yesterday.|I cried and cried.
{14478}{14557}Joseph McCrawley, Denver.
{14597}{14791}Died 30 years ago, age 11.|Your guy is using his ID.
{14861}{14900}Thanks, Jack.
{15001}{15072}Federal Agents. Open up!
{16318}{16439}Oh, my God! That's you.
{18108}{18183}- Yeah?|- Frank Horrigan?
{18188}{18299}- Yeah?|- The Secret Service agent?
{18304}{18424}- Yeah. What did I win?|- My God, it's really you?
{18429}{18567}- Who the hell is this?|- That was you in my apartment.
{18721}{18842}- McCrawley?|- Why not call me Booth?
{18847}{18956}- Why not Oswald?|- Booth had flair and panache.
{18961}{19067}The leap to the stage|after he shot Lincoln.
{19128}{19217}- Where are you?|- Closer than you'd imagine.
{19222}{19329}It's very ex citing to talk to you.|I feel like I know you.
{19334}{19457}I've read about you and seen photos.|You were JFK's favourite agent.
{19462}{19567}But that was a long time ago.|What keeps you going?
{19584}{19653}Let's get together and talk.
{19658}{19753}I think the less you know about me,|the better.
{19758}{19894}- I'm planning to kill the President.|- You shouldn't have said that.
{19899}{20014}Threatening the President is a federal|offence, even if you don't mean it.
{20019}{20083}I mean it.
{20088}{20251}One need only be willing to trade|one's own life for the President's.
{20256}{20367}- That's right.|- I'm willing.
{20372}{20497}Going up against you raises|the game to a much higher level.
{20552}{20629}Fate has brought us together, Frank.
{20634}{20784}- I just can't get over the irony.|- What irony?
{20789}{20916}Your intimate involvement with|the assassinations of two presidents.
{21041}{21128}Hang on a second.|I've got something on the stove.
{21882}{21975}He was a tenant for three weeks.
{21980}{22101}What's really weird is the other|tenants never really saw him.
{22106}{22200}Statements vary.|He was between 5'8"and 6'2".
{22205}{22299}Between 165 and 180 pounds.
{22304}{22396}- Age?|- Between 28 and 45.
{22620}{22725}Before an election, panic is what|you've got on a good day.
{22731}{22799}- They're waiting for you.|- Hey, Frank.
{22804}{22877}- Sam.|- It's been a long time.
{22883}{23048}- I hear the new director isn't much fun.|- I've been the director for two years.
{23053}{23153}Al D'Andrea.|You know Matt Wilder.
{23158}{23250}He still owes me $20|from Super Bowl 21.
{23255}{23370}This is agent-in-charge Bill Watts|and Lilly Raines.
{23375}{23516}- She's very pretty for a secretary.|- And you're very old for an agent.
{23521}{23575}Lilly's an agent.
{23580}{23686}I just wanted to see|if she had a sense of humour.
{23691}{23783}Have a seat.|Let's talk about this guy.
{23788}{23892}I guess we're calling him Booth for now.
{23897}{24009}- What do you know about him?|- He's dangerous.
{24020}{24125}- How do you know?|- I know things about people.
{24130}{24232}Why didn't you take steps|to know more that first night?
{24260}{24337}- We had a busy day.|- Too busy to investigate properly?
{24353}{24468}- A 10-minute search of his room?|- I didn't have a warrant.
{24482}{24581}- Given your reputation...|- What reputation is that?
{24587}{24682}- Let's get back on track.|- What are you referring to?
{24694}{24765}Am I paranoid,|or is he busting my balls?
{24771}{24838}Probably a little of both.
{24857}{24993}Bill, there was a time around here|when I was almost as arrogant as you.
{24998}{25153}I don't have time for this. I've got|to pull 75 agents out of Miami.
{25158}{25247}Keep me posted, Sam, will you?
{25356}{25455}- So what do we do with this guy?|- We keep investigating.
{25460}{25543}- Tap my phone.|- Will he call again?
{25548}{25659}- He'll call. He's got panache.|- Panache?
{25676}{25765}- Yes, it means flamboyance.|- I know what it means.
{25770}{25883}- Really? I had to look it up.|- All right, we'll tap your phone.
{25901}{26027}By the way, Watts isn't nearly|as arrogant as you were.
{26160}{26273}Just what reputation was Watts|referring to, Sam?
{26278}{26343}You know.
{26348}{26516}Am I considered a borderline burn-out|with questionable social skills?
{26521}{26652}What do you want to talk to me|about, besides your reputation?
{26657}{26742}I want to be assigned|to the President.
{26747}{26875}Protection? After all these years?|Frank, you're a dinosaur.
{26894}{27012}- This guy's gonna make a try.|- Watts will fight me all the way.
{27017}{27091}You owe it to me.
{27096}{27201}- I've kept you in a job.|- I've got to come back.
{27318}{27459}Do you really want|to stand post again? At your age?
{27464}{27611}Yeah, I've got at least|one pair of good shoes somewhere.
{29021}{29092}We're stopping.|Traveller wants to work the ropes.
{29102}{29172}The French President's coming.|Get a security man up here.
{29741}{29829}Damn it! Get back.
{30416}{30499}- What's going on here?|- Horrigan had a heart attack.
{30564}{30708}- Hey, are you okay?|- Get the hell out of here.
{30713}{30814}- What's going on?|- I had a call about a cardiac case.
{30819}{30926}- Are you all right, Frank?|- I'm on my break here.
{30946}{31009}I get it, you bastards.
{31014}{31103}Who's the wise guy?
{31108}{31196}Okay, everybody, back to work.
{31296}{31412}- All right, who was the joker?|- It may not have been a joke.
{31417}{31565}- You were looking peaked today.|- I'll pay him back in spades.
{31570}{31657}How can you be sure it was a him?
{31809}{31930}- You've missed my street, Al.|- Why don't you have a car?
{31935}{32033}I lived in New York a long time.|I like public transportation.
{32040}{32136}If you like buses,|why make me go out of my way?
{32161}{32228}I like your company.
{32289}{32402}- He's a weird-Iooking guy.|- Lf he still looks like that.
{32488}{32556}Pull up over here.
{33326}{33438}The President's election troubles|were hardly apparent today.
{33443}{33571}He and the French President|stopped twice to greet the crowds.
{33576}{33712}The Senate has yet to react|to the new French trade agreement.
{33717}{33871}The French will host a formal dinner|at their embassy for the President.
{33876}{33951}Presidential advisors are pleased...
{33956}{34065}...with the publicity this|has brought in an election year.
{34089}{34208}It's a weird sub-culture, Al.|Send some agents to check this out.
{34213}{34363}- Ask about some whackos.|- I'll get on it in the morning.
{34368}{34445}Hang on, I've got the other line.
{34490}{34568}- Yeah?|- Frank.
{34633}{34790}- Booth, how are you doing?|- I'm fine, thanks.
{34808}{34893}Hang on,|I'll get rid of the other call.
{34898}{34997}- You got it?|- Yeah, keep him talking.
{35065}{35160}- Yeah?|- Trying to trace me?
{35165}{35310}- Why didn't I think of that?|- You did. You're a good adversary.
{35315}{35445}- But I was worried about you today.|- Why?
{35450}{35563}In the motorcade, I thought|you were going to pass out.
{35568}{35660}You should get in shape|for that kind of duty.
{35665}{35817}- Yeah, maybe you're right.|- I'm watching your movie.
{35839}{35965}- Movie?|- November '63. Kennedy's last days.
{35970}{36144}The arrival in Texas.|It must have been ex citing.
{36149}{36270}Dallas. That morning at Love Field.
{36275}{36412}You all look so radiant.|JFK, Jackie and you.
{36417}{36501}You look so young and able, Frank.
{36506}{36576}What did happen to you that day?
{36581}{36723}The only agent to react to the shots|was farther away than you.
{36728}{36873}You must have looked up at that|window, but you didn't react.
{36878}{36980}Late at night when the demons come...
{36985}{37118}...do you see the rifle at the window,|or Kennedy's head being blown apart?
{37165}{37307}If you'd reacted in time,|could you have saved him?
{37312}{37464}If you had, that could've been|your head being blown apart.
{37469}{37605}Do you wish you'd succeeded,|or is life too precious?
{37610}{37671}What's done is done.
{37676}{37855}I have that Esquire article|about you and the other agents.
{37860}{37999}So sad how your wife left you|and took your little daughter.
{38026}{38119}You were so forthright|about your drinking problem.
{38124}{38196}And that you weren't easy to live with.
{38208}{38293}I was so moved by your honesty.
{38298}{38425}The world can be a cruel place|to an honest man.
{38430}{38519}What about you, Booth?|What's your story?
{38556}{38611}It's an epic saga.
{38636}{38743}I'll talk to you again soon.|It's nice to have a friend.
{38928}{38990}- Did you get him?|- We got him.
{39491}{39667}He may have a device that makes it|look like he's using another number.
{39681}{39803}- This device, how could he get it?|- He could build one.
{39818}{39916}- Can you trace it?|- We could run a parity check.
{39933}{40041}- Can you trace the call?|- Not if it's a para-analog line.
{40046}{40161}Give me a straight answer,|or Al will shoot off his foot.
{40166}{40319}If he calls again, keep him on|the line. We'll see what we can do.
{40324}{40457}You might suggest that the police|don't knock down any more doors.
{40477}{40665}I have that Esquire article|about you and the other agents.
{40689}{40813}So sad how your wife left you|and took your little daughter.
{40818}{40926}You were so forthright|about your drinking problem.
{40931}{41005}And that you weren't easy to live with.
{41015}{41106}I was so moved by your honesty.
{41145}{41265}- Okay, but why play it for me?|- Cancel the President's dinner.
{41304}{41453}The dinner at the French Embassy?|This close to the election?
{41483}{41583}He manipulated the phone system.|He could have knowledge of explosives.
{41588}{41698}- Do your job. There'll be no problems.|- There may be arms in the embassy.
{41711}{41831}You think the French|want to knock off the President?
{41838}{41880}Why does every chief of staff...
{41886}{41997}You have no reason to think that|this is anything but an idle threat.
{42002}{42131}You want me to cancel a state dinner|and risk offending the French?
{42144}{42284}This guy's pushed your buttons|and you're overreacting a little.
{42289}{42379}- I'm trying to protect your boss.|- So am I.
{42388}{42506}We're trailing 12 points in the polls,|and the election's in six weeks.
{42525}{42612}- He's got to be seen.|- Even if it kills him?
{42689}{42773}How could being down 12 points|look like good news?
{42778}{42844}The President was even worse off|weeks ago.
{42849}{43001}He'll be out with the voters in|the Midwest and then in California.
{43084}{43177}The President and First Lady|of the United States.
{43182}{43285}His Ex cellency, the|President of France and his wife.
{44295}{44367}Agent Raines,|you look devastating tonight.
{44384}{44514}Good enough to eat...|if you'll pardon the expression.
{44519}{44636}I try to sympathize with you,|but you really do annoy me.
{44660}{44715}Why sympathize?
{44721}{44811}The tape of that phone call.|When he mentioned your wife.
{44817}{44904}- Ex-wife.|- At any rate, I'm sorry.
{44909}{45060}Strange, I get sympathy from|an assassin and a woman I annoy.
{45065}{45164}- Would you care to dance?|- Perhaps some other time.
{45169}{45224}I get off in a couple of hours.
{45281}{45400}- What are you looking at?|- Where do you hide your firearm?
{45441}{45496}Don't tell me, let me guess.
{45678}{45847}We're on our final approach to L.A.|It's a beautiful day out there.
{45852}{45951}Thanks for flying with us.|We hope to see you again.
{46385}{46548}- Deposit this in the new account.|- I'll need to see your papers.
{46676}{46769}"Microspan Corporation."|What kind of business are you in?
{46783}{46869}- Software.|- Up in San Jose?
{46874}{46968}I'm based there,|but I'm opening an office in L.A.
{46978}{47096}You're not from San Jose?|Where are you from?
{47124}{47208}- Minneapolis.|- You're kidding! So am I.
{47253}{47326}Well, it's a small world.
{47380}{47461}I hated the winters.|I used to stay in and pig out.
{47466}{47626}- What high school did you go to?|- New Brighton High school.
{47681}{47833}- There isn't any New Brighton.|- There was when I was there.
{47861}{47937}Well, maybe I'm just confused.|It happens a lot.
{47963}{48104}- There was a school across from...|- I'm late, will this take long?
{48130}{48185}Not at all, just another minute.
{48241}{48290}Thank you.
{48416}{48545}- You have a very pleasant manner.|- Thank you, Mr. Carney.
{48841}{48946}How would you like|to give a colleague a ride home?
{48958}{49054}- Why do you keep flirting with me?|- Am I?
{49059}{49190}- You know it can't go anywhere.|- That's why I do it.
{49201}{49298}Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.|No further obligations.
{49404}{49542}- How many female agents are there?|- About 125.
{49576}{49681}- Pure window dressing.|- Excuse me?
{49694}{49819}Window dressing.|125 out of 2,000.
{49824}{49948}You're around so the President|looks good to his feminist voters.
{49960}{50075}- Do make an effort to be obnoxious?|- It's a gift.
{50080}{50205}We do a lot of window dressing.|Like running with the limousine.
{50210}{50311}It'd take an anti-tank missile|to put a dent in it.
{50316}{50422}But it makes the President|look more presidential.
{50427}{50600}If I'm here for the feminist vote,|what demographics do you represent?
{50623}{50702}White, piano-playing,|heterosexuals over the age of 50.
{50707}{50830}There ain't a lot of us,|but we do have a powerful lobby.
{50905}{51012}- Time flies when you're annoyed.|- Where are you going?
{51017}{51071}- I have a date.|- With whom?
{51089}{51150}That's none of your business.
{51155}{51260}- You want a ride?|- I don't think so.
{51265}{51367}I like it here this time of day.|I think I'll hang out.
{51372}{51454}Okay, thanks for the ice cream.
{51459}{51540}- See you.|- You're welcome.
{51761}{51869}If she looks back,|that means she's interested.
{51881}{52057}Come on now, give me that|smug look and be on your way.
{52285}{52412}Well, Abe... Damn, I wish|I could've been there for you.
{52608}{52716}Hi, baby, how are you doing?
{52726}{52813}Yes, I missed you too.
{52896}{53050}I didn't mean to startle you. I got|your address from the phone book.
{53055}{53219}- I'm not listed.|- Well, I better come clean.
{53224}{53334}I followed you. I'm sorry,|I'm not very good at this.
{53339}{53494}I'm new in town. I was wondering|if you'd care to join me for dinner.
{53566}{53595}That's sweet, but...
{53600}{53722}I also wanted to apologize for lying|to you about being from Minneapolis.
{53775}{53814}I shouldn't ask so many questions.
{53831}{53945}Did you mention our conversation|to anyone at the bank?
{53950}{54027}- No!|- May I?
{54101}{54172}Rory, settle down!
{54177}{54289}- Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi.|- This is my roommate.
{54294}{54436}- Sally, this is Mr. Carney.|- Nice to meet you.
{54446}{54573}- I was just on my way out.|- I'm sorry, but you can't leave.
{54578}{54628}What?
{54633}{54712}You shouldn't have been|from Minneapolis.
{54717}{54804}I don't know what you want, but...
{55267}{55391}- Hi, this is Sally.|- This is Pam. We're not in right now.
{55396}{55533}- Leave your name and number.|- And we'll call you back. Bye.
{55695}{55844}Frank, I hope you don't mind me|calling you at the office.
{55849}{55943}- No, why don't you drop by?|- I'd love to.
{55948}{56057}Let me take some time to welcome|those who are joining us late.
{56068}{56158}I'd love to drop by.|We've got so much in common.
{56178}{56243}We do? Like what?
{56251}{56318}We're both willing to trade|our lives for the President's.
{56323}{56431}We were both betrayed|by those we trusted.
{56451}{56529}- I wasn't betrayed, Booth.|- Sure you were, Frank.
{56535}{56655}The Warren Commission reported your|procedure as seriously deficient.
{56676}{56776}They criticized all the agents for|being out drinking the night before.
{56795}{56918}As if Kennedy would be alive today|if you'd been in bed by 10 p.m.
{56993}{57092}- Maybe they were right.|- No, they weren't right.
{57097}{57223}You wanted to have agents stationed|all around his car. He refused.
{57228}{57353}Do you know why?|Because he had a death wish.
{57358}{57477}He talked all the time|about being assassinated.
{57483}{57610}His favourite poem was about death.|I think he wanted to die.
{57616}{57799}And I think he didn't care that|his death would ruin your life.
{57804}{57874}What do you think?
{57911}{57971}Frank?
{58003}{58118}- What about you? Who betrayed you?|- I don't think he's scrambling it.
{58123}{58260}Some of the same people,|but I'm going to get even.
{58265}{58406}I'll have my day in the sun.|The question is, will you?
{58411}{58497}I think you're in|for a lot more pain.
{58502}{58603}How much of this shit|do I have to listen to?
{58628}{58688}He's across the street.|LaFayette Park.
{58705}{58745}Booth!
{59648}{59720}I told you to get in shape, Frank.
{60341}{60444}That's him! Al, that's him!
{61231}{61372}Secret Service! I'm impounding|this car. He put his hand on here.
{61377}{61525}- We got fingerprints.|- Are you all right, Frank?
{62711}{62805}Hey Tony, have a look at this.
{62831}{62936}- The print from Secret Service?|- Yeah, it's really strange.
{62941}{63016}This is C-12. We can't tell them.
{63093}{63233}Horrigan, I'm afraid|we've drawn a blank.
{63238}{63361}- You're sure?|- We ran it against everything.
{63509}{63632}I'm meeting with the President.|You keep investigating.
{63637}{63751}- What should I do?|- You'll think of something.
{63756}{63834}You're a real pain|when things don't go your way.
{63839}{63894}Your friends warned you about that.
{64271}{64455}The President hit the campaign trail|today on a 6-day tour of 12 states.
{64480}{64596}With just a month to the election,|he's trailing by 10 points.
{64601}{64728}He'll concentrate on the Midwest,|where he's sagging in the polls.
{64733}{64870}The campaign will wind up|in Chicago with a big rally.
{64898}{64948}Reservations.
{64953}{65109}Do you have a flight on Tuesday|from Washington to L.A.?
{65114}{65278}I'd like an open-ended ticket so I|can make some stops on my return.
{65292}{65392}C-5, off-load the choppers first.|Who's our route agent?
{65426}{65481}That'll be Jacqueline King.
{65486}{65600}This is Watts,|we have arrival at 13.15.
{65605}{65750}- Where are we keeping the cars?|- Denver PD has an area for us.
{65770}{65830}This is Watts,|we're ten minutes out.
{65835}{65938}Here in Denver we gather today|in the shadow of giants.
{65943}{66104}Brave pioneers who overcame the|wilderness and carved a new nation.
{66109}{66236}Today we are asked|to match our vision to their vision.
{66241}{66328}And to pass that legacy on.
{66333}{66439}- Is sector three secure?|- Sector three is secure.
{66494}{66575}The President was campaigning|today in Denver.
{66881}{66968}We are living in a time|of global economic transition.
{66978}{67092}We need compassion and vision|to create a future...
{67097}{67215}...of peace and progress|for everyone.
{67220}{67346}The President is due to arrive|here in L.A. Later in the month.
{67351}{67438}He'll compete for California's|54 electoral votes.
{67882}{67960}This is Sandy Riggs calling.
{67965}{68087}If you want to catch a rally|in the Midwest, you'd best call me.
{68092}{68176}The President has no fixed schedule.
{68181}{68345}In answer to your other question, just|send a cheque to party headquarters.
{68374}{68506}Ladies and gentlemen of Holly, Michigan,|the President of the United States.
{68552}{68681}We've gone a long way|toward achieving that goal...
{68686}{68802}We've got some trouble up ahead.|Notify the White House staff.
{68807}{68895}Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
{69033}{69186}Flight 318 to Milwaukee|is now boarding at gate 21.
{69191}{69308}All passengers|proceed to the boarding area now.
{69451}{69501}Checking.
{69506}{69601}Hey, pal, found any bombs today?
{69715}{69896}- Did the First Lady ask about me?|- Have you gotten to know them yet?
{69901}{70004}- I prefer not to get to know them.|- Why is that?
{70009}{70089}They might not be worth|taking a bullet for.
{70094}{70172}Here comes my replacement.|Let's go to the bar.
{70177}{70282}- We can't drink on the road.|- But they have a great piano player.
{70488}{70568}I've played for presidents|and with presidents.
{70573}{70674}Nixon and I once did|a duet of "Moonglow."
{70679}{70788}- I heard he didn't like you.|- We got on all right.
{70793}{70873}His Chief of Staff didn't like me.
{70878}{70982}He once ordered me to get rid of|some anti-war protesters.
{70987}{71098}I said I couldn't do that.|Freedom of speech and such.
{71103}{71220}He said, "When I'm talking to you,|I am the President."
{71225}{71340}I said, "You look like a sack of shit|in a cheap suit to me, sir!"
{71345}{71440}- The "sir" was a classy touch.|- I thought so.
{71750}{71846}You never wear shades|when you're standing post.
{71851}{71938}I like the whackos|to see the whites of my eyes.
{71943}{72076}A glare can be just as effective|as a gun. Know what I mean?
{72081}{72165}You know what I mean?
{72400}{72435}You got me.
{72441}{72519}You'd better stick to the shades,|sweetheart.
{72918}{73021}What are you afraid of?
{73026}{73133}I'm afraid of making a big mistake.
{73138}{73215}Good night.
{74589}{74678}Good, we've got some updates|on Milwaukee.
{74683}{74739}Thanks.
{75924}{76006}Don't answer it.
{76096}{76189}Raines.
{76392}{76491}Okay, I'll be right down.
{76570}{76696}Traveller's losing ground in|Georgia. Milwaukee's out tomorrow.
{76701}{76826}And they're staging a rally|somewhere outside Atlanta.
{76885}{76946}Damn!
{77044}{77122}What am I doing?
{77272}{77336}Oh, Lilly...
{77354}{77488}I've got to put all that shit|back on, damn it!
{77679}{77791}I'm glad to see you all|out here in the rain with me today.
{77796}{77928}I've been saying,|"Don't just vote for me, join me."
{77933}{78066}And today you certainly have.|We may get a tad damp today.
{78089}{78180}But guess who's gonna be all wet|on Election Day?
{78431}{78547}- How about the watch list?|- 23 crazies are under surveillance.
{78561}{78587}The hospital?
{78593}{78670}Extra units of Traveller's|blood type are on hand.
{78676}{78746}Accessible to the alternate route too.
{79006}{79088}- Under the weather?|- Sick as a dog, Lilly.
{79109}{79210}What's this? " Psychological|Profile of John Booth."
{79229}{79300}- Did you make a mistake?|- What?
{79323}{79418}You said you were afraid|of making a big mistake.
{79475}{79619}With this job, let's be realistic.|It's not like we work in a bank.
{79666}{79779}- You had an affair with an agent?|- He wasn't an agent.
{79806}{79905}But he left you|because you wouldn't quit your job?
{79910}{80012}I left him.|I wouldn't quit my job for him.
{80017}{80087}It broke my heart.
{80092}{80249}You vowed never again to let a man|come between you and your career.
{80254}{80384}But now you're in love with me and|it scares you a little, doesn't it?
{80390}{80479}- Blow your nose.|- Sorry.
{80571}{80721}What would happen|if I gave up my job for you?
{80801}{80879}Why would you do that?
{80884}{81006}I vowed never again to let my career|come between me and a woman.
{81164}{81221}Frank...
{81240}{81329}Hey, be careful, will you?
{81334}{81423}This whole event's been advertised|in advance. Just be alert.
{81755}{81890}Watts, it's Horrigan, it's a zoo here.|We gotta take Traveller underground.
{81903}{82023}This is Watts. We are using the|alternate arrival site. Underground.
{82369}{82492}- Watts, Booth may be here.|- I thought you couldn't identify him.
{82498}{82632}- I can't. Just call it a hunch.|- Ignore your psychic abilities.
{82637}{82708}All posts take to your positions.
{82724}{82830}- You've got a fever, Frank.|- You stay alert in there, will you?
{82967}{83066}One quality above all|marks this President.
{83074}{83197}It has earned him the respect|of the people of this country.
{83202}{83289}That quality is courage.
{83294}{83485}The question is, will we stand|by the man who has stood by us?
{83504}{83587}- Stage right?|- Stage right, all clear.
{83603}{83690}- Stage left?|- Stage left, clear.
{83696}{83800}- Stage centre?|- Stage centre, clear.
{83877}{83979}The President of the United States|and the First Lady!
{84900}{84977}- Gun!|- Get down!
{85315}{85383}What the hell's going on in there?
{85453}{85516}All clear.
{85521}{85636}- False alarm.|- Traveller's secure. Resume positions.
{85644}{85732}- Are you hurt, Mr. President?|- I'm all right.
{85756}{85938}Everything's all right, folks.|We had a little false alarm there.
{85959}{86069}That was exciting, wasn't it?|Take your seat, please.
{86092}{86229}It was just a balloon popping.|Traveller wants to continue.
{86771}{86858}Do you have any idea how many|votes you cost us last night?
{86864}{86926}The President looked like a coward.
{86932}{87044}He looked all right. You were|the one who looked like a coward.
{87064}{87141}- Is this just a joke to you?|- No, you're a joke to me.
{87147}{87213}- You have no idea what we do.|- That's enough!
{87219}{87303}I'll have you busting|counterfeiters in Alaska!
{87316}{87413}Keep him away from the White House|and away from me!
{87418}{87491}- The man's a disgrace.|- You can't talk to him like that.
{87496}{87526}I don't work for him.
{87532}{87670}You work for me. At least|you did. You're off my detail.
{87867}{87999}My Super Bowl debt. In case|I don't see you after this trip.
{88207}{88250}You know, Frank...
{88277}{88371}...if you just acknowledge that|it was an unfortunate situation...
{88376}{88479}- I'm not going to apologize.|- I'm not saying you should.
{88484}{88579}- But the President was humiliated.|- He's alive.
{88584}{88677}- We are here to save his dignity too.|- I'm not paid for that.
{88682}{88833}When Kennedy's girlfriend got into|trouble, you said she was with you.
{88887}{89013}- That was just a rumour.|- I heard the whole story.
{89018}{89138}You were suspended for a month|in order to save his dignity.
{89149}{89248}- He was different.|- Maybe you were different.
{89253}{89346}I was different.|The whole country was different.
{89352}{89484}Everything would be different if I'd|been half as paranoid as I am today.
{89638}{89689}Frank...
{89985}{90143}Why not just retire? Live off|your pension. What's the point?
{90216}{90294}Somebody else asked me that|not long ago.
{90299}{90391}You don't spend any money,|except on jazz records.
{90396}{90495}I want to stay|on the Booth case, Sam.
{90538}{90625}All right, but as for|protective detail...
{90630}{90691}I understand.
{90810}{90900}That thing in Chicago...
{90905}{91013}I've never been on the wrong side|of a judgement call like that.
{91018}{91140}You had the flu!|That can impair your judgement.
{91145}{91280}Face it, Frank.|You're too old for this shit.
{92640}{92726}What happened|in the Windy City, Frank?
{92731}{92798}Booth?
{92803}{92950}- Did the balloon get you panicky?|- You were there.
{93024}{93200}I couldn't help wondering why you'd|risk your life to save such a man.
{93205}{93328}You have such a strange job. I can't|decide if it's heroic or absurd.
{93333}{93456}Why would you risk your life|to kill a man like that?
{93461}{93576}- Read my psychological profile.|- I don't believe in them.
{93581}{93698}Nor do I. A man's actions don't equal|the sum of his psychological parts.
{93703}{93769}- It doesn't work that way.|- Just how does it work?
{93887}{94033}It doesn't work. God doesn't punish|the wicked and reward the righteous.
{94038}{94141}Everyone dies.|Some die because they deserve to.
{94146}{94287}Others die because they come|from Minneapolis. It's meaningless.
{94292}{94401}If none of this means anything,|why kill the President?
{94423}{94573}- To punctuate the dreariness.|- You need to get yourself laid.
{94606}{94720}You're the same. Name one thing|in your life that has any meaning.
{94777}{94828}- I play the piano.|- That's not enough.
{94833}{94871}How do you know? Do you play?
{94886}{94986}I've seen you in your bar alone.
{94991}{95148}There's no cause worth fighting for.|All we have is the game.
{95153}{95266}- I'm on offence. You're on defence.|- When do we start playing the game?
{95290}{95375}The clock's ticking, Frank.|Take care.
{95534}{95627}He scrambled it. I missed him.
{95632}{95699}Fuck!
{96401}{96464}Jesus, Frank.
{96495}{96612}I called for hours.|I thought something happened to you.
{96617}{96795}I'm sick, I'm tired|and I'm armed, too. So be careful.
{96800}{96931}- You're also maybe a genius.|- Not to be recognized in this lifetime.
{96936}{97016}- Did you listen to the call?|- Yeah, remember...?
{97021}{97070}Call the field office in Minneapolis.
{97076}{97126}See what you can find|about the accidental deaths.
{97131}{97216}Frank!|Will you listen to me, please?
{97222}{97329}- Spit it out, damn it!|- We spoke to some model builders.
{97334}{97510}There is a professor at Pasadena|College. I think we've got something.
{97515}{97634}I met him at a design conference|in New Orleans a year ago.
{97639}{97774}We ordered a few rounds of drinks.|He seemed like a nice enough guy.
{97779}{97873}But when we talked politics|he got a nasty edge.
{97878}{98034}He said the government betrayed him|and he was out for revenge.
{98039}{98110}The way he said it scared me.
{98115}{98233}I said, "Nice talking to you."|And I got the hell out of there.
{98248}{98356}For the life of me|I cannot remember his name.
{98361}{98463}But I'm pretty sure|he said he was from Phoenix.
{98468}{98612}You ought to talk to a guy|in Phoenix named Walter Wickland.
{98617}{98742}- We're going to Phoenix.|- Let's get a police artist.
{98747}{98882}- Have a sketch faxed to us.|- You figured that out by yourself?
{98887}{99004}- Kiss my ass, Frank.|- I told you you'd make a good agent.
{99055}{99184}That doesn't look much like him,|but it's got to be Mitch Leary.
{99190}{99332}- I haven't seen him in over a year.|- What do you know about the guy?
{99337}{99438}You see this wheelchair?|Mitch bought it for me.
{99443}{99533}It cost over $1,000.
{99538}{99634}- You see this?|- Take it easy now.
{99639}{99719}This is in case he ever comes back.
{99724}{99804}He accused me|of ripping off his design.
{99809}{99892}He said my penalty for disloyalty|was death.
{99899}{99986}If you put him away,|I'll sleep better.
{99992}{100119}- Where can we find him?|- I've got his address somewhere.
{101827}{101888}Don't move.
{102120}{102169}Drop it!
{102470}{102542}- Let him go, Horrigan.|- I got him.
{102547}{102661}It's okay. We're on the same team.
{102666}{102808}- Hands, motherfucker!|- I'm getting my identification!
{102829}{102914}- Give it to me.|- David Coppinger. CIA.
{102942}{103054}- And who's this asshole?|- He's with me.
{103092}{103181}- God dammit!|- Are you here for Leary or me?
{103186}{103296}Mr. Leary used to be|one of our operatives.
{103327}{103453}- He's threatened to kill the President.|- We didn't think he was serious.
{103458}{103526}- But you knew. You and the FBI.|- I understand your frustration.
{103531}{103632}You understand my frustration?|You pompous son of a bitch!
{103638}{103761}What did Leary do for you?|Run drugs? Sell arms to Iran?
{103766}{103873}It's a C-12 matter,|so this is off the record.
{103878}{103925}If asked, I'm going to deny it.
{103999}{104141}- Leary's what we call a wet boy.|- What's a wet boy, Frank?
{104146}{104342}- Leary's an assassin.|- He's more like a predator.
{104779}{104851}- Was that you shooting?|- Yes.
{104856}{104977}- What kind of gun is that?|- Something I made.
{105000}{105109}You made it?|That beats paying for it.
{105114}{105185}- Can I see it?|- Yeah.
{105207}{105321}- It's light. What's it made of?|- It's composite. Like plastic.
{105335}{105445}Pretty neat!|Mind if I give her a little dance?
{105450}{105540}- Not at all.|- Go for it.
{105739}{105816}That is great! That is really great!
{105918}{106053}- Would you sell it?|- No, I need it.
{106058}{106193}- For what?|- To assassinate the President.
{106373}{106491}- Why would you want to do that for?|- Why did you kill that bird?
{106668}{106796}Leary was one of our most effective|contractors, but times changed.
{106801}{106911}Cutbacks had to be made.|Leary didn't take it too well.
{106916}{107057}- We've not been able to locate him.|- We can work together on this.
{107062}{107186}- Wouldn't that be refreshing?|- We have fingerprints and photos.
{107197}{107344}- These are at least 15 years old.|- He's camera-shy.
{107352}{107497}He'll be in disguise, anyway.|We need photo alterations, Sam.
{107502}{107633}What I'm about to show you|is highly classified.
{107673}{107775}This is a former colleague|of Leary's. A close friend.
{107780}{107909}He went by Leary's home to try|and get him to accept counselling.
{107914}{108016}This is how Leary|treats his friends.
{108120}{108291}We need every possible variable.|Facial hair, glasses, weight change.
{108296}{108384}Keep in mind|he's 15 years older now.
{108913}{109024}As good as they are, they aren't|much good. The eyes are dead.
{109029}{109126}You can always tell a man|by his eyes.
{109149}{109238}- Tomorrow morning I'd like you to...|- I'm resigning tomorrow.
{109243}{109310}What?
{109315}{109448}What for? Because you were scared|down in Phoenix? I was scared too.
{109467}{109635}I have nightmares about that|boat with the bag over my head.
{109640}{109737}I can't breathe.|Phoenix clinched it.
{109742}{109884}- The service has counsellors.|- I've been to counsellors.
{109895}{110006}- We can get this guy.|- I can't do it!
{110011}{110174}Stop this cockamamie shit.|Come on, pal, I need you.
{110179}{110245}Please.
{110337}{110448}Okay, Frank.
{110616}{110726}Cockamamie. That's a word|your generation hasn't embraced yet.
{110731}{110838}You ought to use it once in a while|to keep it alive.
{110843}{110919}- Cockamamie!|- Yeah.
{110924}{111001}- Oh, God!|- Well, it made you laugh.
{111007}{111055}You kill me, Frank.
{111230}{111407}Hello, Frank. And let me welcome|all of you joining our programme.
{111412}{111484}I know who you are, Leary.
{111609}{111727}I'm glad. Friends should be able|to call each other by name.
{111732}{111816}- We're not friends.|- Sure, we are.
{111822}{111869}I've seen what you do to friends.
{111925}{112041}- What's that supposed to mean?|- You slit your friend's throat.
{112255}{112372}- You talked to Coppinger?|- Yeah.
{112377}{112472}Did you de-Iouse?|The man's a professional liar.
{112484}{112591}- I saw the photos.|- No, you saw what he wanted you to see.
{112597}{112682}I saw a picture of your friend|with his throat cut.
{112689}{112804}What you don't know|is that they sent my best friend...
{112809}{112921}...to my home to kill me!
{112943}{113035}- Your voice is shaking.|- I haven't lied to you, Frank!
{113040}{113149}Everyone who ever knew you|says you're sick.
{113154}{113279}- Your colleagues. Your wife.|- What does your wife say about you?
{113284}{113379}Frank, I want you to understand.
{113384}{113518}We both used to think that this|country was a very special place.
{113523}{113658}Do you have any idea|what I've done for God and country?
{113663}{113726}Some horrible things!
{113731}{113847}I don't even remember who I was|before they got their claws into me.
{113856}{114035}- They made you into a real monster.|- And now they want to destroy me.
{114110}{114204}What do you see when you're in|the dark and the demons come?
{114308}{114479}I see you standing over the grave|of another dead President.
{114492}{114562}- That's not gonna happen.|- Fuck you, Frank.
{114567}{114698}I'm willing to trade my life|for his and that's all it takes.
{114703}{114803}That President is coming home|from California in a box.
{114825}{114922}- Where in California?|- The address?
{114927}{115029}I'll keep you in the game,|but I won't throw it for you.
{115034}{115161}- I want you to give yourself up.|- To live a long and fruitful life?
{115214}{115323}Don't lie to me.|I have a rendezvous with death.
{115328}{115429}So does the President.|And so do you, if you get too close.
{115434}{115608}- You have a rendezvous with my ass!|- You know how easily I could kill you?
{115613}{115699}I've watched you go home.
{115704}{115810}You are alive because|I have allowed you to live.
{115815}{115892}Show me some damn respect!
{116139}{116196}St. Francis Hotel!
{116587}{116620}Frank.
{120842}{120921}Take my hand, Frank.
{120937}{121026}Take it. If you don't, you'll die.
{121121}{121188}Take it.
{121544}{121647}You're gonna shoot me|after I saved your life?
{121779}{121879}The only way to save the President|is to shoot me.
{121884}{121974}Are you willing|to trade your life for his...
{121979}{122060}...or is life too precious?
{122437}{122514}Leary, don't move!
{122572}{122637}I got him!
{122734}{122811}Al?
{123652}{123726}There's nothing here.
{124922}{125017}Frank, you've got a phone call.
{125287}{125399}Frank, you looked so sad on the bus.|I'm sorry, it was self-defence.
{125555}{125693}- Tell me about Skellum.|- Skellum is worthless.
{125698}{125831}- Are you gonna meet him in L.A.?|- You're way behind in the game.
{125838}{125938}I'm way ahead. I know what you|look like. I've seen your eyes.
{125943}{126021}- They might look different next time.|- Not what's behind them.
{126026}{126147}- You better pray I never find you.|- You want to kill me, Frank?
{126152}{126222}That's right.
{126227}{126323}- The irony's so thick here.|- There is no irony!
{126328}{126470}The same government that trained|me to kill, trained you to protect.
{126475}{126566}Now you want to kill me.|Up on that roof I protected you.
{126572}{126615}They'll write books about us.
{126620}{126765}- I'm tired of your bullshit!|- Don't be a poor sport.
{126770}{126941}You could have taken me out,|but you chose to save your ass.
{126974}{127048}It does make me wonder about Dallas.
{127053}{127249}Did you really do all you could,|or did you make a choice there too?
{127254}{127353}Do you really have the guts|to take a bullet?
{127358}{127458}I'll be thinking about that|when I'm pissing on your grave.
{127567}{127663}There's no one named Skellum|in all of Los Angeles?
{127668}{127769}- What about Louisiana?|- Hang on.
{127840}{127930}No Skellums. Sorry.
{127935}{128001}Damn it!
{128197}{128309}- The election's in three weeks.|- Just stay out of California.
{128314}{128408}If this guy's so smart, he's not gonna|tell you where he'll do it.
{128413}{128471}I don't think he'd lie to me.
{128476}{128558}You've become that close?
{128563}{128668}California is the key|to the whole race.
{128673}{128814}- We can't let up now.|- We have to change our procedure.
{128819}{129004}- Frisk people within 50 yards.|- At $10,000 dinners?
{129009}{129109}- You're overreacting.|- Lf I don't, the President's dead.
{129114}{129218}- Why is he even here?|- He's heading this investigation.
{129223}{129330}Then let him investigate,|but keep him out of sight.
{129350}{129440}If you'll excuse me,|I'm in the middle of a campaign.
{129632}{129720}Frank. Hi.
{129751}{129888}- Up late?|- L.A. Will be a lot of work.
{129893}{130000}- What's up?|- I've got a request.
{130034}{130146}I'd like you to talk to Watts.|Get me on your team.
{130257}{130375}- He thinks you'll overreact.|- What do you think?
{130380}{130509}- You're too close to all this.|- That's why I've got to be there.
{130514}{130634}- I can spot him. Anticipate him.|- You think he'll be in California?
{130639}{130784}- Why would he tip you off?|- He wants to keep the game close.
{130858}{130990}This has nothing to do with|you and me. Strictly professional.
{131006}{131102}But that son of a bitch|killed my partner. My friend.
{131117}{131204}I know. I'm sorry.
{131311}{131385}You're looking at a living legend.
{131390}{131496}The only active agent|who ever lost a President.
{131555}{131621}Please.
{131953}{132015}Mr. Horrigan, welcome to Los Angeles.
{132065}{132183}Can the President close the gap|in the little time he has left?
{132188}{132331}Today he's in California for a rally|at the Bonaventure Hotel.
{132554}{132683}Field office, the advance team|is at the Bonaventure.
{133838}{133907}- Any problems?|- No.
{134029}{134116}We've swept the motorcade route.
{134121}{134262}Manholes are secured. Mailboxes|removed. Abandoned vehicles towed.
{134406}{134512}We'll need sharpshooters|on both those towers.
{134517}{134642}We need sharpshooters|to cover those restricted areas.
{134647}{134744}Other polls today had the President|three points behind.
{134749}{134857}He'll have to close that margin|in California.
{135087}{135159}Welcome to Los Angeles|International Airport.
{137974}{138138}- Raines, double-checking those exits?|- Yes, this is the third time now.
{138367}{138440}Alert, section five.
{138593}{138663}Secret Service.
{138844}{139018}- Robert Stermer.|- He's a bellboy. He's cleared.
{139068}{139210}- Robert, have a nice day.|- No questions.
{139215}{139322}Come on, pack it up and move.
{139339}{139428}Mr. Carney, all set.
{139433}{139516}Finally we meet!|You are James Carney?
{139521}{139678}- You must be Sandy Riggs.|- So you really do exist.
{139683}{139827}- I'm very much human.|- Let's go up to the bar.
{139868}{139984}- When does the President arrive?|- Tomorrow, before dinner.
{139989}{140131}Here's an invitation. Don't lose it.|The Secret Service is acting crazy.
{140136}{140248}You've got a great seat,|just across from the President.
{140281}{140379}So what is Microspan Corporation|all about?
{140384}{140497}I just came to meet the President.|I won't bore you with business.
{140502}{140596}I don't blame you.|I don't understand high-tech.
{140601}{140704}I can't wait to introduce you.|Look at this beautiful view.
{140741}{140782}Yes, very pretty.
{140841}{140946}Give me the list of dinner guests.|Who was the organizer?
{140951}{141067}Sanford Riggs|of the California Victory Fund.
{141101}{141200}Call LAPD and make sure|they have no uniforms missing.
{141209}{141364}- It's been taken care of.|- Call the hospital about blood.
{141376}{141508}Your average American businessman|who looks at product marketing...
{141513}{141638}...sees the length and width of it.|The Japanese see the depth.
{141643}{141778}We plan the next fiscal quarter.|They plan the next quarter century.
{141783}{141957}- Our people don't understand that.|- Mr. Riggs, can I talk to you?
{141977}{142073}- Who's that?|- Secret Service agent.
{142089}{142174}- Do you know all these people?|- I sure do.
{142179}{142309}- How about these pictures here?|- I went through all this yesterday.
{142314}{142403}I'll cooperate, but this is|bordering on harassment.
{142408}{142490}I'm a harassing kind of guy.
{142508}{142554}No, no, no, no.
{142588}{142644}I'll be right back, Mr. Carney.
{142654}{142696}He did what anyone of us would.
{142701}{142790}He beat up a bellboy on television.|I'd say he was overwrought.
{142796}{142869}We're all overwrought.|Leary's out there someplace.
{142874}{142949}- You don't think he's a liability?|- No.
{142955}{143023}Well, you're in the minority.|I want him gone.
{143028}{143135}- Send him on to San Diego.|- By whose order?
{143140}{143240}Traveller.|Do you want to tell him or should I?
{143245}{143352}Miss Raines, somebody's|approaching Traveller's suite.
{144226}{144294}- Hi.|- Hi.
{144328}{144507}- What are you doing up here?|- Seeing what I could do.
{144548}{144687}Between the LAPD,|the FBI and the rest of us...
{144692}{144822}...there are 229 people|protecting Traveller tomorrow.
{144839}{144918}A lot of guns.
{144935}{145068}If Leary gets off a shot,|we could be killed in the crossfire.
{145109}{145179}Frank.
{145220}{145335}- Bill Watts just called.|- Heard about the bellman?
{145340}{145416}So did Traveller.
{145421}{145558}They want you to go to San Diego|and assist in the advance.
{145563}{145644}Just like that.
{145651}{145765}It's not just you against Leary.
{145770}{145877}Have some faith in the rest of us.
{145916}{145996}You know something?
{146050}{146147}For years I've been listening|to all these idiots...
{146152}{146270}...with their pet theories on Dallas.
{146275}{146365}It was the Cubans, or the CIA.
{146370}{146446}The white supremacists, or the mob.
{146451}{146580}Whether it was one weapon|or whether it was five.
{146610}{146697}None of that meant too much to me.
{146713}{146810}But Leary...
{146815}{146934}He questioned whether I had the guts|to take that fatal bullet.
{146993}{147084}God, that was a beautiful day.
{147141}{147224}The sun was out.
{147241}{147321}It had been raining all morning.
{147413}{147528}The first shot|sounded like a firecracker.
{147533}{147633}I looked over and saw him.|I could tell he was hit.
{147710}{147789}I don't know why I didn't react.
{147794}{147906}I should've reacted.|I should've been running.
{147940}{148024}I just couldn't believe it.
{148108}{148224}If only I'd reacted,|I could've taken that shot.
{148352}{148443}It would've been all right with me.
{149609}{149707}- What's the number in San Diego?|- 619 ukulele.
{149717}{149806}- Ukulele?|- That's how I remember it.
{149811}{149914}You just push U-K-E-L-E-L-E.
{149949}{150078}- Ukulele? Isn't that U-K-U?|- I don't know.
{150083}{150209}But the phone number is U-K-E-L-E-L-E.
{150411}{150559}U-K-E-L. Wait a second.
{151025}{151050}Jesus.
{151056}{151166}We have an arrival.|Chopper standing by.
{151509}{151600}- Southwest Savings, may I help you?|- Southwest?
{151605}{151740}- Yes. May I help you? Hello?|- What's your address?
{151871}{151924}Taxi!
{152005}{152125}- Post check. Post 3?|- In place.
{152130}{152191}- Post 6?|- In place.
{152196}{152262}- Post 12?|- In place.
{152410}{152480}Wait right here.
{152527}{152610}There's no Leary in our accounts.
{152615}{152741}Try to imagine him in disguise.|A hat, wigs, that sort of thing.
{152761}{152895}- I haven't been here long.|- Who was here before you?
{152900}{153013}- Pam Magnus.|- Where can I find her?
{153061}{153166}She's dead. She was murdered.
{153945}{154061}- She was murdered.|- They won't cancel.
{154066}{154169}- Then make the arrival underground.|- They want a big show.
{154174}{154268}- We need proof.|- How about a dead president?
{154425}{154593}I'm pulling up all the accounts|Pam made, but it'll take time.
{154598}{154665}Fax me the list|as soon as you get them.
{154752}{154827}All agents in position.
{156382}{156504}- Please step back.|- Empty your pockets.
{156548}{156622}Thank you.
{157886}{157923}You're from Texas, right?
{158539}{158569}I'm sorry.
{160358}{160442}Frank! Watts is gonna shit|if he sees you!
{160447}{160576}- Have you got a fax for me?|- Yeah, what is it? What's this about?
{160667}{160761}What the hell is going on, Frank?
{161087}{161149}James Carney.
{161550}{161609}Carney, James.
{162156}{162258}- What the hell is he doing here?|- I don't know.
{162277}{162367}- Who gave you permission...|- He's here. His name is Carney.
{162372}{162498}- I want the seating chart.|- Give him the chart.
{163185}{163259}Gun!
{163568}{163644}Stop! Put the gun down!
{164198}{164224}Get down!
{164383}{164422}Don't shoot!
{164438}{164515}Get him in the car!
{164660}{164693}Hold your fire!
{164882}{164912}Get out of his way!
{164946}{164992}He's got a hostage!
{165167}{165280}Raines to shooters.|If you have a shot, take it.
{165600}{165633}Nice view.
{165672}{165819}- What's the plan, Captain?|- It's your man. You tell me.
{165824}{165959}Get me sharpshooters|on the north and west towers.
{165964}{166048}Take the subject out.
{166449}{166500}You had the guts.|You took the bullet.
{166529}{166658}- I broke my damn ribs.|- Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.
{166667}{166783}Where the hell are the shooters?
{166788}{166911}- West tower in place. No lights.|- No shot from the north.
{166916}{167005}A bulletproof vest|is a bit of a cheat.
{167010}{167119}- Otherwise, you played a good game.|- It's no game, Leary.
{167124}{167233}I was doing my job.|What do we do now?
{167238}{167307}Do you believe|in the nobility of suicide?
{167334}{167352}No.
{167358}{167447}But if you want to blow your head off,|be my guest.
{167452}{167598}Nicely put, but I don't want|to leave this world alone.
{167618}{167738}- West tower, do you have a shot?|- Negative, too dark. Target unclear.
{167772}{167931}- It's better to die with a friend.|- Friend? You're a damn killer!
{167936}{168029}I saved your life. You owe me.
{168034}{168155}- I don't owe you shit.|- I was always honest with you.
{168160}{168282}- Go ahead and shoot.|- It's Frank. Quiet!
{168287}{168362}- Come on.|- Are you talking to me?
{168367}{168451}- What are you waiting for?|- Waiting for?
{168456}{168548}I'm waiting for some gratitude.
{168553}{168663}Without me, you're a sad-eyed,|piano-playing drunk.
{168668}{168761}I brought you into this game.|I let you keep up with me.
{168772}{168855}- I made you a hero today.|- You didn't make me anything.
{168860}{168930}I redeemed your pathetic life.
{168936}{169007}I just did my job.|You're the one with a pathetic life.
{169012}{169131}- Go ahead and shoot!|- Lf they fire you'll be hit.
{169138}{169254}- I want you to thank me first.|- Shut up and shoot.
{169332}{169349}- All right, Frank.|- Stand by to fire on my command.
{169349}{169446}- All right, Frank.|- Stand by to fire on my command.
{169491}{169587}- Sleep well, my friend.|- Just one thing, aim high.
{169592}{169652}- What?|- Aim high!
{169657}{169708}- Now!|- You bastard!
{170954}{171048}Take my hand.|If you don't, you'll die.
{171053}{171243}- You want to save me, Frank?|- To be honest, no. But it's my job.
{171384}{171445}Take it.
{172757}{172847}Are you okay?
{172932}{173022}We've worked with Agent Horrigan|for some time.
{173027}{173125}He exemplifies|courage and self-sacrifice. Frank!
{173144}{173243}I guess I overreacted again, Harry.
{173705}{173848}Agent Horrigan, why are you|retiring from the Secret Service?
{173853}{173961}Well, I hate desk work and I'm|too old for running around.
{173966}{174101}And thanks to all this press,|I'm no good for undercover work.
{174124}{174257}How are you, Frank?|The President sent his limo for you.
{174262}{174358}- That's the least he could do.|- Good. I love public transportation.
{174447}{174520}Come on in.
{174552}{174634}Make yourself at home.
{174910}{175025}- So, what do you think?|- I like it.
{175030}{175183}Hello, Frank. By the time|you hear this, it'll be over.
{175188}{175314}The President is most likely dead|and so am I.
{175319}{175498}Frank, did you kill me? Who won|our game? Not that it matters.
{175503}{175666}Among friends, like you and me, it's|how you play the game. The game's done.
{175671}{175749}It's time to get on with your life.
{175754}{175870}I worry that|you have no life to get on with.
{175875}{175944}You're a good man.
{175949}{176048}Good men, like you and me,|are destined to travel a lonely road.
{176073}{176149}Goodbye and good luck.
{176246}{176372}I bet you that brown pigeon|flies off before the white one.
{176377}{176440}How do you know?
{176446}{176570}I know things about pigeons, Lilly.

Dr Ross, we`ve gotsatellite[br]from the Congo.
- What did he say, Rudy?.[br]- I can`t repeat it here. It`s CharIes.
It won`t work. The oId man`s got me[br]changing the code every three hours.
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.[br]- Very inventive.
- We shouId have a visuaI momentariIy.[br]- They said they found it.
Seven voIcanoes, and he picks the[br]right one. His Iuck`s finaIIy changed.
- Karen.[br]- I read you, CharIes. And I see you.
Well, eureka and all that.[br]l found the bloody thing.
- What was that?[br]- The whole place does the shimmy.
- How`s the voIcano?[br]- Acting verymuch like a volcano.
- l wouldn`t build condominiums.[br]- CharIes, did you reaIIy find it?
Chemically flawless,[br]blue diamond alluvia.
Johnny-on-the-spotphasic laser.
This will look kind ofraw[br]without a real diamond.
- That test came backpositive.[br]- Oh, my God.
We found the sand in a mineralstream.[br]Jeffrey`s searching for the source.
- I`II get Travis.[br]- Wait. Jeffrey should share the glory.
- Let`s link up again in one hour.[br]- Great. Give me your coordinates.
CharIes ..?
- Jeffrey ...[br]- CharIie, over here.
CharIie, I think this[br]may reaIIy be something.
- We haven`t got much time.[br]- I`II show you.
Jump in.
- What?[br]- I`II go first.
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey!
- What is this?[br]- Come on.
From beIow it just Iooks Iike jungIe,[br]but it`s not just jungIe. See?
Jesus Christ.
This is a big deaI.[br]This is a big find.
I can`t beIieve it. AII these centuries,[br]just sitting here, waiting for Iucky us.
Listen, I raised Houston,[br]they`re getting the oId man.
Come share the gIory.
- We`II have to get another team here.[br]- Let me grab my bag.
- Perfect? A fIawIess diamond?[br]- He found it. He was right.
With the right Iaser and diamonds, we`II[br]take over the communications industry.
CharIes says a Iaser with a diamond[br]Iike that can punch a hoIe in the moon.
Come on, Jeffrey.[br]Jeffrey!
Come on, we`re supposed to transmit[br]in ten minutes.
Now you`re throwing stuff at me?
- Where is he?[br]- I don`t know. They`re ten minutes Iate.
Activate the remote.
- I guess he`s stiII Iooking for Jeffrey.[br]- Pan the camera.
What in God`s name ..?
Lock your remote. Back scan.[br]Give me thermaI readout.
- I can see seven dead peopIe.[br]- What`s that sound?
I didn`t see him.[br]CharIes!
- I`II get heIp.[br]- I had the code changed.
WeII, what is it? Rudy?.
- Sir?.[br]- Use the fire extinguisher on that.
- What`s the code, sir?.[br]- Do what I say!
- No one knows this happened but us.[br]- FamiIies must be notified. Your wife.
We don`t know he`s dead.[br]If it`s reported, they`II cIose the border.
- What was that thing? A goriIIa?[br]- Baboon. GoriIIas don`t do that.
- It couId have been a rivaI company.[br]- Not another paranoid fantasy.
I need those diamonds, Dr Ross![br]It`s the future.
- Most beIieve chiIdren are the future.[br]- 40,000 peopIe are depending on me.
This sateIIite is our cash cow.
In three years it`II be obsoIete. I need[br]a new cash machine. This diamond`s it!
- CharIes knew it. That`s why he went.[br]- He went into the Congo to pIease you.
- I know you had feeIings for him.[br]- I aImost married him.
You have to go down there, Dr Ross.[br]You`re good in the fieId.
The Iaser`s power pack[br]shouId give off a readabIe signaI.
- Take over an existing expedition.[br]- What are you taIking about?
There`s no time! Once we Iet out what`s[br]happened, Zaire wiII shut the border.
- Are you human?[br]- I`II be human Iater. I`II get good peopIe.
- Find out what happened to CharIes.[br]- Say it`s because you Iove your son.
It is.
Okay. But if I have one moment when[br]I think otherwise, I`II make you sorry.
That`s a promise.
Oakland`s number one classic station,[br]takingyou back in time, all the time.
Isn`t that beautifuI?[br]What`s Amy`s favourite coIour?.
Green, that`s right.[br]How green was my vaIIey ... Drop that!
Good. Pretty. So pretty.
No, Amy, on the paper.[br]Good.
Amy, get some more paint.
Good. That`s green.
No, Amy, on the paper.
Good girI. Such a pretty girI.
That`s your Iovey.
Amy! Hey, you!
- How did she sIeep?[br]- Great. No nightmares.
That`s my Amy.
Richard, you better cIean her up.[br]It`s showtime.
Communication is what separated[br]human from animaI. Speech.
And for those who couIdn`t speak,[br]sign Ianguage. An aIphabet in gestures.
Then came virtuaI reaIity.
Sensors worn Iike cIothing couId read[br]and repIicate the body`s movements.
ArIiss Wender at MIT was the first to[br]appIy this technoIogy to sign Ianguage.
Our subject, William,[br]was born without the organs ofspeech. lsn`t thatright, William?
Thatis absolutely right.
This is the fiirst time[br]l have everheard my own voice.
Lights, pIease.[br]It`s hard to get grants for what I do.
Most peopIe just don`t beIieve it.[br]They think it`s a parIour trick. A gag.
But it`s no gag.
This technoIogy Iets me demonstrate[br]what has never been demonstrated.
AnimaIs can taIk. Amy,[br]couId you come down here pIease?
HeIIo, Amy. Thank you for the fIowers.
Hello, Peter.
Amy, how oId are you?
Amy seven.[br]Amy good gorilla.
- Amy pretty.[br]- Yes, you are.
This is a taIking goriIIa, Moira.[br]This goriIIa is taIking!
- I know.[br]- This is reaIIy happening.
- This isn`t Mr Ed.[br]- I know it`s not Mr Ed.
Amy, Iook at me.
- Amy mother.[br]- That`s right. That`s your baby.
- Amy wants lunch.[br]- Okay.
- What do you think, Mrs Romy?.[br]- It`s spooky. Very spooky.
Amy`s above average inteIIigence[br]for a goriIIa, but she`s not a freak.
What she has Iearned, other goriIIas[br]can Iearn. But it takes money.
Amy, caIm down. Easy.[br]It`s okay. You`re aII right.
- You`ve got her sedated. She`II be fine.[br]- She won`t be fine. Nightmares again.
Captive goriIIas can degenerate[br]mentaIIy, having to be destroyed.
When she did these paintings[br]she got better. Why?.
Hey, hey ...[br]What`s this room starting to Iook Iike?
She`s been painting the jungIe![br]She wants to go home.
Peter, you did a great job.[br]You taught a goriIIa to taIk, to paint.
You can get a grant for anything[br]except setting her free.
I taught her, now she can teach[br]the mountain goriIIas.
- We`II transIate other animaIs` speech.[br]- Oh, pIease. Making you Dr DooIittIe?
No foundation wouId fund[br]an expedition with that objective.
I wiII pay.
- I wiII pay for Amy to go home.[br]- And who are you?
Herkermer HomoIka. Romanian. Free[br]now of the chains of Ceaucescu.
TraveIIing the worId, doing good.
- A Romanian phiIanthropist?[br]- Don`t Iook a gift horse in the mouth.
We`re taking Amy home. Get packed.
Do you know where we`re going?[br]Amy, where are we going?
- Jungle. Mejungle.[br]- She`s reaIIy excited.
- Are you excited?[br]- Me? I`m terrified.
Safari? I don`t even Iike picnics.[br]Nice gIasses.
- That`s right. JungIe. Home.[br]- Tickle me.
Time to go.
Someone Iooking for me?
Herkermer HomoIka, heIIo.[br]The transport.
- Is there a probIem?[br]- Not unIess there`s a probIem.
Are you excited? That`s a camera.[br]Be carefuI, it`s expensive.
I think she`s got a reaI eye.
- Professor Karen Ross.[br]- Professor Peter EIIiot.
Have you got my faxes,[br]Fed Exes and phone caIIs?
- It`s a hastiIy put together expedition.[br]- To the Congo, with a taIking goriIIa.
- I need to join up with you.[br]- I`m afraid that`s impossibIe.
- This is ready to Ioad on the pIane.[br]- We`re taking this stuff off the pIane.
- I can pay part of the cost.[br]- They`re taking stuff offthe pIane?
- I`m sorry, we don`t need any money.[br]- You can easiIy find room for me.
It`s not a matter of that. It`s Amy.[br]She gets jeaIous very easiIy.
- Why are you unIoading the pIane?[br]- TaIk to the operations guy.
I have to be on your manifest, or my[br]visas are worthIess. Name your price.
- I have none. I`m not a pound of sugar.[br]- Don`t be hasty, Dr EIIiot.
Herkermer HomoIka,[br]formerIy of Romania.
There seems to be some gIitch.[br]They`re unIoading the pIane.
UnfortunateIy there has been[br]a sIight interruption in my credit fIow.
- I am unabIe to pay for the fueI.[br]- I`II pay for it.
- l`ll pay for it. How much is it?[br]- $56,000.
56,000?[br]What are you smiIing about?
You need me, Dr EIIiot.
We`ve been cleared for take-off.
Please make sure[br]thatyour seatbelts are fastened.
- We`re returning her to the jungIe.[br]- Not a moment too soon.
- You`re the reason she`s upset.[br]- Me? What did I do?
- Ugly woman.[br]- Yes. Now Iet`s get your seat beIt on.
Forgive me. I`II expIain Iater.[br]See? I`m buckIing my seat beIt.
- We`re aII buckIing our seat beIts.[br]- You can do it.
That`s it.[br]Good girI. Here`s an egg.
- We do not throw things.[br]- Is she dangerous?
Humans are dangerous,[br]goriIIas are gentIe.
You think the goriIIa[br]may be dangerous? Maybe so.
Don`t perpetuate the King Kong myth,[br]the myth of the kiIIer ape.
- Are you sure some goriIIas don`t kiII?[br]- You can`t be serious.
What`s your area of expertise,[br]foIk singing?
- Communications technoIogy.[br]- A geek with a ceII phone.
I`m a scientist. But you[br]and your protege beIong in the circus.
Just because you came up with[br]a wad of cash ... It`s okay, Amy.
- Where ground?[br]- It`s fine. We`re fIying.
- We`re going to the jungIe.[br]- Amy wantgreen drop drink.
Amy wantgreen drop drink.
AII right.
You`d swear they were married.
The ``kiIIer ape`` is poIiticaIIy incorrect,[br]but that`s not to say it`s untrue.
- I can`t beIieve what I`m hearing.[br]- CIiches usuaIIy contain some truth.
- Are you serving that ape a martini?[br]- She`s aIIowed one. It`II caIm her down.
In my Iife I have heard[br]many a bizarre story -
- containing bizarre truth.
- I`m sorry I caIIed you ugIy. If I didn`t ...[br]- I know, it was for Amy`s benefit.
Can I ask you something?[br]Why teach an ape to taIk?.
Why teach anything to anyone? It[br]doesn`t make you rich or get you girIs.
Why did Prometheus steaI fire[br]onIy to give it away?.
One face of the inherent generosity[br]in the human spirit is the teacher.
I repeat, why teach an ape to taIk?.
- No practicaI reason.[br]- Then why did you do it?
``A IoneIy impuIse of deIight.``
- WiIIiam ButIer Yeats.[br]- Very good.
Did it work?.[br]You`re not IoneIy anymore?
Why are you going to Africa?
To find something I Iost.
- Watch your step.[br]- Dr Ross!
Eddie Ventro. Mr Travis asked me to[br]meet the pIane, set up your expedition.
- Hers? She`s just aIong for the ride.[br]- Whatever. Be an asshoIe.
- Who is this guy?.[br]- Ventro, transportation and equipment.
But I don`t suppIy asshoIes with new[br]personaIities. Let`s see your new pIane.
You want to seII that goriIIa?[br]It`s worth a Iot of money.
- How much? I`m just curious.[br]- 20-25 grand for a femaIe.
- Amy want to go home.[br]- I`m taking you home.
Whoa, a taIking goriIIa! I can feeI the[br]money hairs on the back of my neck.
Mr Travis toId me to Ioad you up.[br]You know how to use aII this stuff?
- Do you reaIIy need a baIIoon?[br]- No, Iet me see that.
- Who are they?.[br]- Hi, feIIas!
The fuck if I know. We`re on[br]our third government in two years.
- So you`re our guide?[br]- No, you`ve got Monroe KeIIy.
- Is he good?[br]- Very good, and very Iate.
Now what? Why do I feeI Iike[br]this airport`s just gone to shit?
- Give me your passports.[br]- Our guide is Robertson ReynoIds.
Yeah, I fired him.[br]Robertson ReynoIds is a bird-watcher.
The Kigani have had it with Zaire[br]and they`re eating peopIe.
You go in with ReynoIds, you come out[br]somebody`s boweI movement.
Wasn`t that easier than customs?
Monroe ...
We need to switch airports.[br]Bomb in the president`s car.
- It was his car?. Did they get him?[br]- That`s the bad news. No, they didn`t.
- I hope you foIks have Iots of money.[br]- We do.
Thank you. Now run away ...
Get in the back. Leave the equipment[br]to Eddie. I wouId hurry.
- Is this normaI?[br]- You`re on your own, Eddie.
- Where do you want me to set you up?[br]- Get a DC-3. The strip near Kegoma.
First the Kigani in Zaire, now this[br]godfather stuff. Not a good day.
- Lower the fIaps.[br]- Good Iuck!
I`m getting out of here.
- What`s going on?[br]- Are we safe?
It`s aII right, just a few bumps.
Amy, Ieave that man aIone.
Amy, don`t inhaIe.
Karen Ross? Monroe KeIIy.[br]I`m your great white hunter for this trip.
- Though I happen to be bIack.[br]- How bad is this news for us?
Whenever Ieadership comes into[br]question, they tend to murder everyone.
- Oh, my God![br]- They Iive to settIe scores.
And they`ve got a Iot of scores to settIe.[br]It`s Iike in the Congo.
Things are pretty bad in the Congo.[br]The Kigani are pissed off.
Can`t bIame them. The 22th century[br]sucks. Maybe the 21st wiII be better.
- Are you a criminaI?[br]- Aren`t we aII?
I`m not a criminaI, I`m a scientist.
I run a few guns, you sons of bitches[br]ruin the worId.
- We shouIdn`t be invoIved with them.[br]- What wouId you suggest?
As soon as we can,[br]we shouId go our own way.
Don`t I know you?
Perhaps. I traveI a great deaI.
- What are you doing with that goriIIa?[br]- Taking her back home to the Congo.
Taking her back to the farm[br]now that she`s seen Paree?
And this is your cover?.[br]Pretty good. Or, it wouId have been.
- I`m nobody`s cover.[br]- You find yourseIf in the middIe.
- Cover for what?[br]- I don`t know, and she won`t teII you.
But the money her company[br]is throwing around isn`t for a goriIIa.
ReIax. You`re in better hands[br]than you shouId be.
No one can go to Zaire.[br]The border is shut. There is a revoIt.
- It`s not my fauIt. Where`s my goriIIa?[br]- She`II be kept on the truck ...
- Isn`t this a hospitaI?[br]- This one`s decided to speak.
- This is pure Kafka.[br]- Who is Kafka? TeII me!
- Monroe.[br]- Captain Wanta.
How are you?[br]Miss Ross, such a pIeasure.
Have some coffee and cake.
Have some!
You have our visas. This is a scientific[br]mission. You have no right to detain us.
Liar, Iiar, pants on fire.
So says my computer, Miss Ross.
You used to work for the CIA.[br]Now you`re TraviCom.
- They pay better?.[br]- You have a big mouth.
Everybody says that about me.[br]What can I do?
- Monroe, you have terribIe timing.[br]- TeII me about it.
They bIew up the president`s Mercedes.[br]Our country wiII be in shit for a year.
- Captain, I need that truck.[br]- And ten good men to the border.
More.
Mr HomoIka?
Stop eating my sesame cake.
Stop eating my sesame cake!
What are you doing in my country,[br]you bag of shit?
Captain, pIease.[br]I onIy wish to expIore and discover.
This feIIow is a big bag of shit.
Shake this rat from off your neck.[br]He owes money to everybody.
I wiII ask you to wait outside.
I Iike that, Miss Ross. You surprise him.
So, I put this away.
Don`t want nobody peeking.
It`s the goriIIa that wiII get you[br]across the border safeIy.
Everyone`s afraid of being seen in an[br]American movie being crueI to goriIIas.
This is the crazy worId we Iive in.[br]Okay, you can go.
Hit the road, as they say.[br]And have a nice day.
Are you aII right?[br]Admit it, you`re gIad to see me.
- Kahega![br]- Monroe!
Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy.
- Are we in Zaire?[br]- Tanzania.
Stay cIose to me.[br]Amy, come on.
- I think this is at my expense.[br]- You`re right.
- When wiII we get to the rainforest?[br]- Herkermer HomoIka, right?
You`re not Iooking for[br]SoIomon`s city again, are you?
Mr HomoIka was part of[br]a disastrous expedition five years ago.
They were Iooking for a city[br]caIIed Zinj, but it doesn`t exist.
- It does exist![br]- Three members died from exposure.
- A fourth was somehow shot.[br]- It was an appaIIing suicide.
Mr HomoIka had to be[br]carried out of the jungIe by me.
- I knew he wasn`t a phiIanthropist.[br]- He has done good, mostIy for himseIf.
- Shut up, you fiIthy ...[br]- FiIthy what?
Forgive me. AII that traveIIing[br]has Ieft me ... shaken.
Think nothing of it.[br]AII aboard!
- What`s aII this stuff?[br]- Courtesy of Eddie Ventro.
A customs guy hit me in the head with[br]a can of peanut oiI for stamping visas.
I`m never going back to that country.
You got everything but the baIIoon[br]and the home entertainment centre.
Your boss says ``CaII me``.
You have 1 1 good guys, significant[br]firepower and significant technoIogy.
Good Iuck.[br]Bye, Monroe.
- May I?[br]- There`s one thing I don`t understand.
- If the border`s shut, how do we cross?[br]- Luck.
- What`s going on?[br]- What the heII is that?
Shit. I thought we`d get farther.[br]I`d put her out now.
- Who`s firing on us?[br]- We`re vioIating Zaire`s airspace.
She Iikes bananas? Eat this, darIing.[br]She`s going to feeI great.
Something to keep her caIm.[br]GoriIIa Prozac.
- Can we make it to Bondo?[br]- We`re done.
- What are you doing?[br]- Step aside, pIease.
Miss Ross. Here.
- Why are they putting on parachutes?[br]- Figure it out.
- This won`t work.[br]- I`II take Amy.
- She might get hurt. I can`t risk it.[br]- You know how to fIy this pIane?
The piIot and co-piIot[br]are aIready gone.
Push me, pIease.
Harder, pIease.
You want me to push you too?
See you down there.
- Where`s Amy?.[br]- SIeeping. She woke up coming down.
- That Iady has some set of teeth.[br]- We have to caII this off.
- I`m not James Bond.[br]- I`II take care of you.
I don`t want you to take care of me.
I`m taking a safari[br]into the Virunga region of the Congo.
If you don`t want to go, go wherever.
But this is a dangerous pIace,[br]and peopIe die here very easiIy.
Now, excuse me.
Amy ..?[br]Amy ..?
Such an extraordinary animaI.
Those paintings. Do you think she was[br]drawing something from reaI Iife?
- I think she was drawing home.[br]- What about those ovaI shapes?
- Just a shape she Iikes.[br]- Perhaps.
- Video game?[br]- It gives Iatitude and Iongitude.
- More than that, from the Iook of it.[br]- WeII, it`s a gadget. It has features.
- You found someone or something?.[br]- A IittIe bit of both.
- Why did you quit the CIA?[br]- I never worked for the CIA.
Of course not.[br]But if you had, why wouId you quit?
Because they`re a IoveIess bunch[br]of sons of bitches, and I`m not.
GIad to hear it.
- Okay, here we go.[br]- FabuIous equipment.
- I have air-conditioning, too.[br]- Air-conditioners?
- I suppose it is a bit much.[br]- Shit, I`II take one.
Mr HomoIka ...
- PIease, caII me Herkermer.[br]- AII right. You can caII me Mr KeIIy.
- I wonder what she`s about.[br]- What do you mean?
What you`re after, I`ve got figured.[br]What she`s after, I don`t know.
I`II get you!
I`m heIping that young scientist[br]return his ward to the wiId.
He says the ape may be abIe to teII us[br]the thoughts of the wiId goriIIas.
You`re Iooking for King SoIomon`s[br]diamonds. The Iost city of Zinj.
- I`ve given it up.[br]- Never. The probIem is, it doesn`t exist.
SoIomon must have got his diamonds[br]from Cartier, Iike everybody eIse.
You Iike that, don`t you?
Time for Madam Amy`s vitamins.
This is Karen Ross. 81452.[br]That is KR81452.
Travis, do you read? Karen Ross,[br]81452. Houston, Travis, do you read?
I read and see you. CongratuIations[br]on crossing the border.
- l have a signalfrom the powerpack.[br]- Good. Find the Iaser, you find CharIes.
Let`s hope so.[br]Tomorrow we enter the rainforest.
Karen, l`ve had those images[br]ofthe creature analysed.
- What is it?[br]- lt`s something new, butgorilla-like.
- Are you sufficientIy armed?[br]- Yes.
The bad news is geo-thermaI.[br]You`ve got to hurry.
The region in the Virungas is bad.[br]The voIcanic activity -
- is breaking out ofthe graph. lt`ll blow.[br]Could be a week, could be sooner...
- Watch out![br]- No, dammit! Not again!
I`m terribIy sorry.
It`s destroyed.
It`s compIeteIy destroyed.
- What is that?[br]- FuII moon. CoIobus monkeys.
- That`s monkeys?[br]- Mating season.
When there`s a moon Iike that, every[br]monkey for 200 miIes thinks he`s EIvis.
It`s Amy`s medicaI suppIies.[br]They can`t get wet.
- Shit! Somebody heIp me.[br]- What is it?
- There`s a creature on my ... Look.[br]- That`s a Ieech.
- Take it off.[br]- It`s your Ieech, you take it off.
- Need some heIp?[br]- Here, burn it off with this.
This is disgusting.
Thank you for your compassion.
Here.
- Monroe ...[br]- Don`t indicate you see them.
Mizumu. The ghost tribe.[br]There are probabIy 20 of them.
- I onIy see two. Are they friendIy?.[br]- They`re sensitive. Forest peopIe.
- Why are they Iaughing?[br]- I toId them I was in charge.
- What`s so funny about that?[br]- I`m bIack. I shouId carry Iuggage.
He says there`s a dead white man[br]with a symboI on his cIothes.
Did they say he`s dead?
- What does `TC`` mean?[br]- TraviCom. The company I work for.
They have many IeveIs of ``dead``. You[br]aren`t dead tiII you`re compIeteIy dead.
They haven`t moved him.[br]They beIieve his souI has Ieft his body.
If they move him, his souI wiII be Iost.[br]They`re asking his souI to come back.
Where is the man?
It`s not him, it`s Bob DriscoII.[br]What happened?
Bob?
- Who is this man?[br]- He was on TraviCom`s Iast expedition.
- What happened to him?[br]- I don`t know.
Bob ..?
He`s dead.
- That region is uninhabited.[br]- WeII, something inhabits it.
We saw the camp destroyed. PeopIe[br]dead. A grey goriIIa or something.
Two men are missing. Jeffrey Weems[br]and CharIes Travis, my fiance.
- My formerfiance.[br]- We`d better get to him, then.
BeautifuI boats.[br]Money`s a wonderfuI thing.
- Give her the banana with the dope?[br]- Yes, he gave it to her.
I know. Shitty Peter.
Hey, what`s this?
All the leaves are brown[br]and the sky is grey l wentfor a walk[br]on a winter`s day l`d be safe and warm[br]ifl was in LA
California dreamin`[br]on such a winter`s day...
- What is this Zinj, Mr HomoIka?[br]- I don`t know what you`re taIking about.
It`s beIieved that King SoIomon had[br]a diamond mine in a city caIIed Zinj.
Diamonds?
I suppose there`s no point[br]in pIaying stupid.
We shaII arrive there together,[br]we shaII aII be rich.
That`s fine with me. But there`s no Zinj.
HaIf the safaris never made it back,[br]the other haIf came back with nothing.
Yes, but we have a trumping card[br]that they did not have.
- We do?[br]- We do. That goriIIa.
- She knows where it is.[br]- The goriIIa?
As a young man,[br]I found a book in Soviet Georgia.
It contained a detaiIed drawing[br]of the city of Zinj.
The drawing contained[br]a pecuIiar decoration.
An open eye.
Later, on safari, I found this.
It`s the same symboI.
Look at this.
The goriIIa drew this.
It is the same image. It is the open eye.
That goriIIa has seen the city of Zinj.
- And she wiII take us there![br]- Have you taken your medication?
Have your Iaugh, and I wiII have mine.
Shit ...
- What is it?[br]- The signaI stopped.
- Does that mean ..?[br]- It just means the signaI stopped.
I don`t know what it means.
No probIem.
Oh, my God!
- Shoot it![br]- Amy!
Head for shore!
- How is he?[br]- It`s just a big cut. I`II stitch it up.
- What`s that?[br]- A pIane.
Good Iuck to them. The Zaire Air Force[br]has got a piece of their ass.
Pitch camp. Tomorrow, Mt. Mukenko.
She`s excited. She was born somepIace[br]on the other side of this mountain.
Wow, it`s beautifuI.
Is this your vaIIey, Amy?.[br]It is, isn`t it?
That`s your home.
PrettyjungIe, that`s right.
- What`s she doing?[br]- Yearning for the pIace in her heart.
- The pIace in your heart, Herkermer.[br]- You may caII me Mr HomoIka.
Come on, Amy, Iet`s go.
- We`ve Iost two porters. Ran away.[br]- And they didn`t invite me?
You want your gIove?[br]AII right, sit stiII.
This is a fork in the road.[br]We can go Ieft or right.
- The wrong way Ioses us a few days.[br]- We must foIIow the goriIIa.
- That wouId be Ieft.[br]- My Iast coordinates Iead this way.
- That wouId be right.[br]- Amy, Peter, go this way.
WeII, I don`t have her passion.[br]I`II foIIow the goriIIa.
This doesn`t seem[br]Iike the right way to me.
Good Lord.
- It`s that pIane we saw burning.[br]- Who were they?.
Travis must have sent[br]another expedition.
Looks Iike a rocket got them.[br]There`s no point going in there.
- My God, what a waste of Iife.[br]- We`d better keep moving.
- Don`t move. If you run ...[br]- He`II chase me. I read the books.
- You did good.[br]- Where did you go?
I ran away. Sorry.
- He Iooked right into my eyes.[br]- He`s a siIverback.
I never thought you couId just[br]waIk aIong and see them.
Amy.
Hello. l`m Amy.[br]Good, good, good. Amy.
Let`s take this off.
- She doesn`t reaIIy beIong anywhere.[br]- No, she beIongs here.
- What the heII is that?[br]- Perimeter aIarm around their camp.
But where`s the camp,[br]and their equipment?
I don`t understand it. There had to be[br]300 pounds of equipment.
And there`s no sign of the bodies.
- It`s a dead end?[br]- Maybe, maybe not.
Bingo!
- Son of a bitch![br]- What is this?
It is the city of Zinj ...
... that I have Iooked for aII my Iife.
See, the eyes.
It is the same.
Kahega, guns up. Stay aIert.
Come here, Amy. Stay with me.
First they found the diamonds,[br]SoIomon`s men.
A diamond mine of incredibIe bounty.
Then they buiIt the city around[br]the mine, so that it shouId be protected.
The savagery of the guards[br]was Iegendary.
They instantIy feII upon[br]any thief, any transgressor.
The diamonds fIowed[br]to the kingdom of SoIomon.
- Why did the city die?[br]- Maybe the mines ran dry.
No, the diamonds are here!
- Monroe, over here![br]- What is it?
I found this.
Don`t go in there. I`II go. Don`t be[br]so John Wayne, you couId get kiIIed.
I`m not going in there aIone, either.
- I must go.[br]- I`II just stay out here with Amy.
Not aIone you won`t. Kahega!
Stay cIose together.[br]HomoIka ...
The same hierogIyphics, over and over.
What do they mean?
Amy, don`t wander off!
- Do you speak EngIish?[br]- Yes.
- What`s your name?[br]- CIaude.
That`s an unusuaI name for[br]somebody from ... Where are you from?
- Mombasa.[br]- It`s an unusuaI name for Mombasa.
- Have you ever been to Mombasa?[br]- No.
Then what do you know about it?
I want to go home.
Amy?.[br]Amy, come here.
Where are you, girI?[br]Come on, I`m not fooIing around.
Amy ...
Come here, girI.
CharIes!
CharIie!
- What are those hoIes?[br]- Lava tubes. It fIows through here.
This must Iead to the mine.
Bring a Iight.
Here.
Now here. Come on.
Up here.[br]No ..!
- That`s not going anywhere.[br]- Where can they be? What happened?
- Let`s get out of here whiIe we stiII can.[br]- Help me!
- What`s that?[br]- Richard!
HeIp me! HeIp me!
- Richard![br]- Let me go! Let me go!
Oh, my God! Something ...
- Richard ...[br]- No, Iet`s get out of here.
It`s okay.
They`re some kind of goriIIas.
I never saw an animaI move Iike that.[br]Theyjust kiII.
That`s why the diamonds were never[br]found. The kiIIer ape myth is true.
Bad gorillas.
Let me turn your voIume down.
Here`s your Iovey.
- It`s okay.[br]- Mother. Mother.
Yes, you`re okay now.
- See anything?[br]- No, but I`m the Iast Iine of defence.
Sensor-operated machine pistoIs are[br]set up, if anything comes within 40 ft.
You reaIIy know how to pack.
- I don`t see anything.[br]- Put that out.
They`re testing their perimeter.
- Are they inteIIigent?[br]- Yes, but they shouIdn`t be aggressive.
They`re too damn smart. They`re[br]out there, but what are they doing?
Monroe!
Get down!
- They`re gone.[br]- We`re out of here at first Iight.
I have transIated those hierogIyphics[br]we saw inscribed everywhere.
- What do they say?.[br]- `We are watching you.``
Where are the bodies?
- Have you seen Amy?. She`s gone.[br]- AIong with two porters and HomoIka.
- I`m going to find her.[br]- PeopIe come first, then goriIIas.
We`II retrieve our comrades, then we`II[br]retrieve your missing goriIIa. Mount up!
Peter, take this.[br]I don`t care if you don`t Iike guns.
- Here it is. They domesticated goriIIas.[br]- Domesticated? They`re kiIIing a man.
They bred them to vioIence. They[br]Iooked for the trait and encouraged it.
Guard dogs[br]who turned on their masters.
What`s that smeII?
These are the bones of goriIIas.[br]Of normaI goriIIas.
- This one`s skuII was crushed.[br]- FeeI that?
- Everybody okay?.[br]- Yeah, Iet`s go.
Don`t go this way. It`s aII caved in.
- I was trying to find the mines ...[br]- Be quiet. Got any fIares, Kahega?
- What`s making my eyes burn?[br]- SuIphur fumes.
- What the heII ...[br]- It`s the mines!
`We are watching you.`` It`s the trainers[br]taIking. The teacher is watching you.
Dead teachers.
Look.
Yes, yes, yes. I knew it was true!
The city of Zinj, the diamonds ...
Every word of it was absoIuteIy true.
I`d Ieave those aIone.
- Any other way out of here?[br]- Not that I`ve noticed.
HeIp me. FiII up everything.
- You`ve got to get me out of here![br]- Take a number.
- But we`re going to be rich![br]- Is that a way out?
- Let`s go.[br]- Stay cIose together.
- What is it?[br]- It`s a geode. A giant diamond.
- They cut him off. Kahega![br]- Check if there`s a way out back there.
Jeffrey ...
CharIie!
- It`s him?[br]- It`s him.
Come on.
- Is there a way out back there?[br]- No, nothing.
- We`re aImost out of rounds.[br]- Buy me two minutes.
Ugly gorillas. Go away.
They don`t know what to make of it.
- Amy.[br]- Mother. Mother.
- Peterhug Amy.[br]- MaternaI instinct, Iong may she reign.
- What are you doing?[br]- We`re getting out of here.
They`re going on[br]the endangered species Iist.
Come on, Monroe. Move!
- What the heII is that?[br]- The Iatest thing in communication.
Come on.
Go, Amy!
Keep going!
- Where are they?.[br]- I don`t know.
Hang on!
Watch out!
- Go, Amy![br]- Hurry!
- Amy, come on![br]- You can do it!
- Keep moving.[br]- Head for higher ground.
Get the yeIIow case from that pIane.[br]It`s a baIIoon. I`II get the transmitter.
Amy!
- How cIose is the border?.[br]- Not far.
KR 81452.[br]Houston, Travis, do you read?
KR 81452.[br]Houston, Travis, do you read?
KR 81452.[br]Houston, Travis, do you read?
Karen, I thought I`d Iost you.[br]I sent another expedition.
- Did you getit?[br]- I have bad news. CharIes was kiIIed.
Did you get the diamond?[br]Did you?
- Yes.[br]- Good girI.
Do you remember I said[br]that if you sent me here -
- for some diamond,[br]and not for CharIie, I`d make you sorry?.
Karen, ofcourse l`m upset.
- But what`s done is done. l could ...[br]- I know. You need a new cash machine.
What`ll happen to the satellite iflput[br]its phone numberin the laser and fiire?
The transmitter chip[br]has the sateIIite`s number. lt`s a 12,000 channel chip. lfyou[br]putit through the diamond ... Karen!
This is for you, CharIie.
Amy!
There you are.
Amy, you saved me.
It`s okay.
Thank you.
I Iove you, too.
Mother?.
Oh, I see.[br]It`s Africa. It`s your mother.
Amy, where did you go?
Good goriIIas?[br]What good goriIIas?
Handsome feIIa.
Amy ...
- Look at that.[br]- Is that Amy with the ...
The siIverback. So she`s ...
I see. I see.
She`s home.
- WiII she be aII right?[br]- They know what to do.
- We`ve got to go.[br]- Bye, Amy.
Peter, wouId you do me a favour?.[br]Throw this away for me.
You sure?
Ouch.
- There`s a wind.[br]- I hope it bIows us somepIace good.
In the city where I was born, the past carries the present
Iike a chiId on its shouIders.
- Françoise!
- Coming!
- In the spring of 1952, my parents moved into the house next door to my aunt Jeanne d'Arc.
That year, Iife in Quebec City was marked by three events...
- Sorry.
- The arrivaI ofTV.
- Hold this.
- Her new shoes are filthy!
- Maurice DupIessis's reeIection as provinciaI premier.
And the presence of AIfred Hitchcock, who'd chosen the city as the setting for his new thriIIer.
Among the Iucky few who managed to get into the premiere were my aunt, my mother, and I, warm and cozy in her womb.
In the summer of 1989,
I returned to my hometown.
I'd spent three years in China studying painting.
The neighbourhood hadn't changed, but our house was empty.
I'd come back for my father's funeraI.
Everything seemed the same... the photos of my brother, medaIist at the Canada Games...
Aunt RacheI, my mother's sister, my parents on a picnic at the Aquarium and my cousin Andrê.
- l'm sorry, Pierre.
- Thanks. lsn't Marc here?
- No.
- Didn't you tell him?
- l tried my best, l couldn't find him.
Typical of your brother.
In every room of the house
I found traces of my father's negIect.
Most tragic were the signs of his diabetes, which he hadn't kept under controI.
With time, it Ieft him bIind.
- Take this and drink, this is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new covenant, shed foryou and for all men so that sins may be forgiven.
Do this in memory of me.
-Why's it so empty?
-Well... everyone's dead.
- Please rise.
When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim the death of your Son, until He comes in glory.
We thank you for counting us worthy to stand here and serve you.
You have called to your bosom
Paul-Émile Lamontagne...
- l knew it!
No hot water again!
Why all these afternoon baths?
- lt's supposed to relax me.
- How am l going to rinse? l'll have to use cold water.
And l'll be late.
-Where you going?
- To see Gaston Côté.
Says he can get me a job as a cabbie.
-Why didn't you tell me?
- l hope to start next month.
- Not on the night shift?
Paul-Émile Lamontagne, l asked you a question.
- l can't be too choosy.
-After seven years on a ship, you want to drive a cab all night?
- l'd be a judge, but...
- C'mere, Santa, l'll rinse you.
C'mon!
- Françoise!
-What's wrong?
- No barman knows how to mix every drink.
Say a guy orders a Black Label... you associate something black with him.
Let's say the guy has black eyes... so you think,
Black eyes means Black Label.
For a Between the Sheets, take three different liquors.
You see... the chemical reaction of the liquors depends on the order you mix them.
Say he orders a Dry... you think to yourself,
Dry kind of guy.
You okay?
-Yeah, sorry. ljust felt a bit dizzy.
Marc?
-Yes?
- lt's room service.
- l didn't order anything.
- Didn't you order a Between the Sheets?
- Definitely not.
- lt must be a mistake.
Sorry to disturb you.
-Young man! l'll take your drink.
Put it here, please.
- Did you hurt yourself?
You're bleeding.
- lt's nothing. l might have something for it.
- ''The Sea Horse''...
- lt's not loaded. lt's only meant to scare people.
[TV]: Deng Xiao Ping and Prime Minister Li Peng appear to have the situation in hand.
But most Chinese condemn their decision to attack the peopIe...
- How long have you been married?
- Seven years already. l worry that time is stealing away and that l'll never have a baby.
- Do you pray to the Holy Ghost?
- No, the Holy Virgin.
-You should pray to the Holy Ghost!
He impregnated the Virgin, so to speak.
- Should l see my sister-in-law's healer?
- Mrs Lamontagne!
Afaith healer may have knowledge of women's hygiene and anatomy, but she cannot comprehend the mystery of life, which is God's domain alone.
You're too nervous.
That's why you keep miscarrying.
Say three Hail Marys and an Our Fatherfor penance.
Amen. And ignore your sister-in-law!
-What kept you so long?
- He gave me hell.
-Why?
- 'Cause of you.
-What did l do?
- l'll tell you later.
Thank you, Rachel.
You're very kind.
-What is it, Rachel?
Huh?
Can't you tell me?
Your big sister?
- l hate working at the church.
-You might not have to anymore.
Maybe we can pay you to clean for us. lt would sure help me, because l keep getting sick.
Stop crying like that.
You're so pretty.
Such a shame to cry.
Go dry your eyes.
And bring me my medicine.
- lf the paint smells too much, cut an onion in quarters and put them in the room.
-What if it stinks of onion?
- Give it another coat of paint.
- Here for a room, or just to gawk at our Christmas decorations?
- Can l look around?
-You have to registerfirst.
Who would sign his real name in a sauna?
- Sorry, l don't understand.
-Are you looking for company?
- No. Thank you.
Marc?
Marc? lt's Dad.
Dad's dead.
- l know.
Now leave, Pierre.
Leave. You don't belong here. lt's OK.
We'll go somewhere else.
- Look... it's our name in Chinese. lt means mountain.
This is the horizon, and these are the peaks.
Take away the horizon, and it means river.
-What's the connection?
- Thank you, good night.
- Thanks.
You didn't come to the funeral?
- l didn't belong.
We were never close.
-Why is that?
- l dunno.
Maybe 'cause l was adopted.
What's it matter now?
What's wrong?
What is it? Are you okay?
- lt's nothing.
- But what is it?
- l'll be okay! lt happens sometimes. l feel like the earth's spinning and l get dizzy.
- lt's a revolving restaurant.
No wonderyou feel it moving.
- Come sleep at home.
There's lots of room.
- l don't think l can, Pierre.
- Okay.
Look afteryourself.
- Father, l've sinned against God and the Church.
- Go on, my child...
- Father... l'm guilty of thinking about death.
- That's only normal.
- No... l mean my own death.
Taking my own life.
Everything would be better if l were dead.
- That's against God's will.
God created you to do good.
- But even when l try to do good, l only cause evil. l want so much to confess, my sin is unspeakable. lt's too horrible to be forgiven.
- lt's men who find it hard to forgive, Rachel.
God forgives everything... for God is all merciful.
Don't be afraid.
You're not confessing your sins to me, but to God... through me.
- May l ask you not to take pictures in the church?
-As Mr Hitchcock agreed to the script changes the archdiocese wanted, it would be difficult to refuse his request.
However, filming will coincide with certain activities here, which may be disrupted. l therefore ask you to be very careful, as it is possible...
Dinner was served three-quarters of an hour ago.
Rachel will no longer be working here.
Once we find a replacement, our verger will resume his duties and leave off housework.
- Did you fire her?
- lf you don't mind, we'll continue our discussion after dinner.
- ''And he said...
''a certain man had two sons.''
-What's wrong?
Don't you like it?
- l have to talk to you.
What did she say?
- She refuses to talk... won't say when it happened, who the father is...
-What'll we do?
-Well, one thing's certain... she can't stay.
- Paul-Émile!
Where else can she go?
- Back to your mother's.
- Mom can't look after a baby!
- l can't afford it. l'm just starting work!
- Shhh!
You're so selfish!
- Françoise!
Françoise! l'm thinking of you. l know you inside out. lt'll hurt you to see her with a baby.
- That's not true!
She's my sister, l love her! l don't have a jealous bone in my body. l want to look after her baby, that's all l ask.
- Pierre?
Pierre? l spoke to the guy at the paint store.
He told me why you can't coveryellow with red.
They're both warm colours.
So the yellow shows through the red instead of being covered by it.
He recommends you start with a good coat of green to cancel the red.
Green's complementary to red.
Then, to even out the yellow, you put on a coat of blue.
-Weird, eh? l've put on two coats and it still shows through.
- Think it's hereditary?
-What?
-A suicidal tendency.
-What do you mean?
Aren't you at all curious?
- Only to find my real father.
-What good would it do?
- There are things l want to know... that only he can tell me.
-What if he were a priest?
-What're you getting at?
- Oh, nothing.
-What?
- Something l heard
Aunt Jeanne d'Arc say on the phone.
She'd rattle on... thinking kids couldn't understand.
-What did she say?
- She seemed to be saying that the reason... your mom killed herself... was that a priest got her pregnant.
- How long's it been?
- Four months.
Sorry. l felt an electric shock go right through me.
- How old are you, Rachel?
- Sixteen.
- Does the father know? l'll pray foryou.
-Why'd you scream?
- She nearly electrocuted me!
- Next...
- She's taking forever! ls it the young priest?
- 'Course.
The old one's saying mass.
Why?
- She'll be hours, then.
- So?
Come off it! The young priest?
Where'd that come from,
Jeanne d'Arc?
- No boyfriend...
She's either at home or here.
Who else can it be, the verger?
- But a priest, Christ!
- Don't swear in church.
Anyway... priest or not, he's not made of stone.
- Good evening, Father.
Thank you for seeing me.
- My pleasure.
Haven't we met?
Yes, at your nephew's baptism...
- No, my father's funeral.
- l'm sorry.
That year, the church was reserved from September to mid-Octoberfor a film.
The Americans shot a film here.
Our parishioners went to another church for marriages and baptisms.
Look here...
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Even if l told you the priests' names from then, it would be hard to track them down.
You see, during the ecumenical revival of the '60s, many young priests became more socially involved.
A number of them left the priesthood.
- Seems you weren't baptized there.
-What do you mean? l know l was baptized there.
On the photo, you can see the windows of the sacristy, Dad and Mom...
-And the priest?
- Of course.
-Where is it?
- l gave the album to my ex.
-Where does she live?
-A motel in Charny.
- Let's go get it.
- Drive to Charny?
Nah, forget it.
Massicotte saw me.
- Marc, l'm 20 minutes late.
André'll kill me. l can't help you find yourfather unless you help me.
Meet me at home at noon tomorrow.
- He a friend?
- No, my brother.
- Oh, that's him.
You don't look alike.
- Of course not. l was adopted.
- Get in, we'll go to a restaurant.
- Not hungry.
-What did you eat today?
- My hand. This one's for later.
- Please, don't be vulgar.
- l'm a rent boy, remember?
- The other day, l got carried away. l didn't mean what l said.
Get in. l won't mention Japan.
-What the fuck do you want?
-Where's my kiss? lt's my birthday.
- Liar, it's in October.
- Have you been doing this long?
- Since l was seventeen.
- How old are you now?
What's written on your hand?
M...O...
W...S...E.
What's it mean?
- Get real!
Mowse.
Mowse!
- The rodent.
- That's what they called me in Hamilton. l was the smallest dancer.
The Anglos called me
The Mowse.
- But mouse takes a ''u,'' not a ''w.''
- lt's pronounced mowse, fuck!
You mean l'm stuck with a spelling mistake till l die?
- So how d'you like my brother?
-Your brother...
What's he on?
- My brother gets drunk on mineral water.
- l'll move the kid.
- l want it to be a surprise.
- Marc?
-What?
-You gonna sleep on the floor next to him or...?
- Marc, l asked you a question.
-What?
- Do l ask Moose to leave, or...?
- Shit, you're so discreet!
- He doesn't speak French, fuck!
- Do you still have my family album?
-What album?
- The one with photos of me as a baby.
- Oh. l dunno.
Must be somewhere. Why?
- l need it.
- Right now?
-Yes.
-Why?
- None of your business. ljust want it.
- l figured you wanted something.
You wouldn't come just to see us.
-Where is it?
-You look! lf you want your goddamn family album, you find it!
[TV]: After cIearing
Tiananmen Square, the army attacked peopIe in the streets. ...
-Working today?
- l start at 5, there's a reception.
- Hate to tell you, but you're late.
- lsn't that the noon news?
- No, 6 o'clock.
- Fucking shit!
What's the idea?! lt's not funny!
Where's Marc gone?
- His trout were stinking.
He went to the Aquarium with Moose to feed the seals.
-You're the trout!
Tell him l'll be back.
[TV]: He says twinning the cities wiII raise Japan's awareness of Quebec.
- Sorry, l got held up.
-Where were you?
- Don't ask. ln Charny.
-With your dad's car, l bet.
-Yeah.
-And my license plates?
- l wanted to tell you, but you weren't around.
- l'd arranged to show it to a buyer.
-Well, anyway, sorry l'm late.
- Pierre... it was from 5 to 7. lt's now 8. l call that absent, not late.
300 members of the Seattle
Lion's Club and one barman.
And who took care of room service?
Pierre... that drink for Room 901 the other day...
Did you take it up or not?
- l think l did.
- The guest refused to pay for it.
Says he never got it.
- Strange, huh?
- Hello... l'm sorry, the bar's closed.
We're short-staffed.
Afraid you'll have to wait till--
Oh, it's you, Mr Massicotte.
- Hello, Pierre.
Please come in.
-Would you sign here?
-A game of ''knock-out chess.'' l found the game of Go complicated.
So the Japanese immediately offered something more western. lnstead of chess pieces, you use glasses of alcohol. lf you capture a piece, you have to drink it.
As you can see, the game combines all the refinement of the Orient with the hedonism of Quebecers.
Care to play?
- No.
There may be guests waiting at the bar.
- But l was just informed the bar is closed tonight.
- l should balance the receipts.
-A pity.
Pierre...
The other day, when you brought the drink to my room ''by mistake,'' you knew Marc had been here.
-Yes. l was looking for him.
-Well, now it's my turn.
Where is he?
-What do you want from him?
There are plenty of ex-swimming champs with no choice but to service old johns while they think of their girlfriends.
My brother deserves better than to live as a parasite.
He's worth more.
- l know who his father is.
Do you want red or white?
Just when you think you are in perfect control of the situation, a move you've made previously suddenly comes back to haunt you.
Whether due to miscalculation or an error in judgement earlier in the game, you become aware... of the trap in which you've got yourself, and you begin to panic.
You try to reverse the situation... but too late.
You watch as the chessboard gradually empties... and your hopes vanish... piece by piece.
- Freeze!
- Hello...
No, l'm afraid
Pierre isn't here.
You couldn't speak to him, anyway...
Yeah, l realize it's urgent.
May l ask who's calling?
Hello?... Hello?
- l'll try another number.
- Three minutes!
- Check... mate.
So start talking.
- lmpossible.
-What do you mean?
- The law of silence.
- The what?
- The law of silence.
The seal of the confessional. l'm bound by my calling.
-You're no priest.
- Check and out.
As the saying goes...
Red on white, all is right.
White on red... sink like lead.
Hello.
- lt's Marc.
-Where are you?
-At the police station. l was arrested.
-Just calm down.
- They found coke on me.
- l'll leave in 15 minutes, be there in an hour.
See you.
- Miss Évelyne Morissette.
How do you say godmother?
- l'll wait here.
- But you won't meet Hitchcock!
- Maybe it's better if l'm not there.
- Miss Évelyne Morissette.
Answerthe lady.
- Hello, Rachel. ls Mrs Lamontagne in?
- No, she's at the Château for her niece's audition. l'll tell heryou were here.
- Rachel... l've been summoned to the archdiocese.
They've had letters... saying l fathered your child.
- Go away!
Go away!
- Say thank you to Mr Hitchcock!
-Ah!
- No ambition, just like yourfather.
Come on, you idiot.
- Miss Renée Hudon.
- Beijing hospitals report at least 1,400 dead and 10,000 wounded.
- But the number of dead may be higher.
Students claim several thousand were killed.
Witnesses say the army issued an ultimatum to demonstrators to clearthe square before attacking. ...
- lncredible how you look like your mother.
Marc...
Marc...
There's something you should know.
-What?
[radio]: That was the Concerto in C minor by Mozart performed by WiIIiam Watson.
-We are celebrating a baptism in the sacristy. l must ask you to be quiet.
Please!
- Here... this'll pick you up.
-What is it?
-A Hair of the Dog, to get you going.
-Are you crazy? lt's gin!
- Hence its name.
-What time is it?
- Past noon.
Garance, for Pete's sake!
Can't you vacuum later?
You've all afternoon.
Listen, Pierre, nothing personal, but you're not cut out forthis job.
What can l say?
You Lamontagnes have always been bohemians.
You've no sense of responsibility.
You and your brotherthink life's all fun and games.
And on top of that... l've nothing against... this... l keep up with the times...
But this is no cheap motel.
This is a Canadian Pacific Hotel.
We have an international reputation.
-Ahhhhhhhhh!
- Pardon?
- l said, Fuck you, André!
You can't fire me, l quit!
- No, no, no, no! l'm kicking you out!
- No, l'm leaving!
-Who's walking out, saying fuck you?
-After all l've done! l got you a job, organized the flat, even arranged your dad's funeral!
Garance!
- How long's he been crying?
- Half an hour.
- Fuck.
Help me out. Hold his arm.
-What's that?
- Tests his blood sugar.
So l know how much insulin to give him.
-Would you test me?
- l can't play doctor on the money Marc sends.
- He sends money?
- Forthe kid.
-Wait a second.
The boy is Marc's son?
- He never said?
- l didn't mean to hurt you.
- He couldn't give a shit.
Does as he pleases!
Comes and goes!
Acts like the kid doesn't exist!
He doesn't understand, a kid needs a father!
That to know where you're going in life, you have to know where you're from!
- He probably understands betterthan we think. ln fact, l think he understands very well.
-Wait a sec.
He was looking forthis.
Give it to him.
- Marc...
- Now that Paul-Émile has another mouth to feed, my husband's going to get him a job at the Château.
With the peanuts he earns as a cabbie, he can't support a wife, sister-in-law, and baby.
The rent's already high.
André, not yourfingers!
- Don't you want any cake?
- l'm not hungry.
- Eat it.
You'll feel stronger, you'll see.
At least drink your milk. ls it still painful?
Maybe it'd help if you breast-fed him.
- How would you know?
- Nobody believes me, but it's true.
Françoise and l asked him not to raise the rent this year.
Know what he said?
''You women sit on your one asset.
Why not use it!''
- Don't exaggerate.
- ls it true or not?
-Why don't you shut yourtrap?
Talk to her.
She listens to you.
- Get off my back!
- She's so unhappy.
- She's your sister! Shit!
-What about motormouth, your sister? l have to put up with her, don't l?
Ahhh!
- Stop laughing!
-What're they doing?
- Rememberthis, my girl:
Tears shed are forgotten in bed.
Come back here!
As for Father Massicotte, it's difficult for us to say what became of him. ln 1953, he had already left the Church.
- l see. Thank you.
Goodbye.
-What are you doing?
- Taking a bath.
- Hello?...
Yes, that's me...
Yes...
Yes. That's... that's my brother...
No.
- Better believe it.
- Hello, Pierre.
Have you been waiting long?
- l've been waiting foryou for months.
Looking for something, Father?
The Bible?
Do you plan to convert me by reading from the Gospel of St Mark?
Ah. l thought it wasn't loaded.
He's in the sitting room.
- Pow!
- The embassy in Tokyo handles consular business with great tact and discretion.
Pierre, believe me. l wanted things to be different.
But it wasn't possible. l'm very sorry.
- Sorry?
You steal my brotherfrom me, run off to Japan and all you send back is a corpse and two goddamn suitcases.
Why did Marc kill himself? l asked you a question!
- Poor Pierre.
You need a culprit.
- No. ljust want to understand.
His mother's a dancer in a bar in Charny.
She needs money.
He's diabetic.
He needs care and medication.
And if no one steps in, he'll spend his childhood being dragged from one motel to another.
- Made out to whom?
- To me.
- Take good care of him.
Diabetes is very serious.
Of course, at first it causes only mild vertigo.
But if not properly treated, it can lead to blindness.
Marc never wanted to be tested.
And yet... diabetes is a disease that's almost always hereditary.
In the city where I was born, the past carries the present
Iike a chiId on its shouIders.
We're almost home.
Let's play tightrope.
Scared? l won't let you fall.
Whoops!

You couldn't hide, Johnny!
Nobody hides from us!
Shit!
Get some ice.
I think I broke my goddamn hand.
Sure, Boss.
Fuck you!
Just do me!
Sure, Johnny. But first...
...Mr. Canelli wants a little souvenir.
Open up!
Open up!
We'll send this to your
Witness Protection buddies.
See if it sings on its own.
They can take it to the trial.
Open up, Johnny! Open up!
Benny?
Who in the hell are you?
Close your eyes.
Who are you?
Shut up!
You too!
It's okay.
Do what he says.
Don't move. You're dead.
I need the clothes you're wearing.
Your ring.
Your watch.
All your IDs.
Now.
Do it!
Come with me.
Grab the other one.
Let's go.
Put your clothes on them. Move!
There's been a murder at 232 Alden Drive.
Send the police.
What are you doing?
They killed you, then turned on each other.
Right.
Sons of bitches!
Shit!
This doesn't work without an audience.
Outside. Let's go.
Get in.
Thank you.
Thank you. Anything you ever need, just ask me.
You endangered your life and the US Marshals protecting you.
What?
You went to your old restaurant.
You went back to Gennaro's?
Johnny, are you stupid?
It's the osso buco.
I was fucking dying for a decent meal!
Next time, you're dead!
This only happens once.
Get out.
That was our ride!
Let's go.
Go.
You won't see me again, but I'll know your every move.
Use your heads, lie low and no one will hurt you.
If you try to skip out on your testimony,
I'll deliver you to the Canelli family.
I promise.
I owe you big time.
I'm a stand-up guy, you got it?
You ever need anything, you let me know.
What's your name?
Honey, he doesn't want to be pen pals.
Smile. You've just been erased.
John, would you look at something?
One is from our shop, the others are real.
What do you think?
That's the fake.
Who the hell is that?
If I tell you, I'd have to kill you.
Shut up and run this again.
With a little sleight of hand...
...one very dead John Doe trades places with one very live scumbag.
Robert, sit down.
You know...
...if God was as forgiving as WITSEC...
...hell would be one empty joint.
God doesn't have our court system.
I understand you had a busy night.
Some witnesses got careless.
- I see.
- I had to defuse the situation.
Did that include breaking into the county morgue?
Someone taught me that improvisation is the heart of field work.
It was you.
In the old days. Weather's changed.
Now every asshole in Congress is down our backs.
I'm telling you to walk softly.
Is that why Beller called me in?
Because of the morgue?
No, no, no.
He doesn't know anything about that.
I don't think he has to.
Shadow Ops still has some privileges.
You're right.
John...
...good work.
I had a good teacher.
Bullshit.
You had the best.
14,640 some-odd people under WITSEC protection...
...and not one with a profile like this.
That bad?
That good. This young lady, Miss Cullen...
...is a real live, bona fide...
...honest person.
Then why does she need us?
She's a senior executive at Cyrez Corporation.
They're major defense contractors.
Top-secret weapons research.
Looks like someone inside Cyrez is selling out Uncle Sam.
Feds need her to prove their case.
If they do...
...she'll be the key witness in the hottest scandal since Iran-Contra.
- When does this go down?
- Tomorrow.
The sting's in place.
When it's over, she's all yours.
Sealed file on relocate. Your eyes only.
As usual, only you and I will be privy to the exact location of your witness.
But, John...
...there are some serious players in Washington...
...who could be badly burned.
So could she.
Welcome to Cyrez Corporation.
All visitors are required to stop at the security station on the right.
Good morning, Dave.
She's in.
Anything yet?
Not yet.
That's right, lady. We're right here.
We're on.
You hear me?
We hear you.
I look okay?
Tell her she looks great.
Not bad, Miss Cullen.
Not bad for an amateur.
We're right with you.
Yeah.
Then let's do it.
- Good morning, Miss Cullen.
- Good morning.
Station C?
Yes.
And how long today?
Ten minutes max.
Okay.
You're doing just fine, Lee.
Let's hope we bought the right combination.
Bingo!
Shit!
It's okay. We lose transmission in the vault.
What now?
Now we wait.
She better move fast. She's only got five minutes till the shift change.
What's taking so long?
Sweetheart, you've got two minutes left.
Shouldn't have used her.
Shit! She's out of time.
Welcome back, Lee. We're with you.
Miss Cullen...
...Mr. Donahue would like to see you.
In a minute.
He said, "Right now. "
- What's going on?
- I think they made us.
Check the directory.
Where's Donahue's office?
Twenty-fifth floor.
I know.
Twenty-fifth floor.
Get backup ready to roll.
This could go south.
What is it, William?
That's someone I trusted for five years.
Someone I told others could be trusted.
I was pulling...
Don't!
We're way beyond bullshit here.
Who are you working for?
Shit, we're dead.
I should ask you that question.
I thought it was for the US government.
Come on, Lee.
What do you think we do here?
This isn't the Red Cross.
We make weapons, things that kill people.
If the government won't pay the price...
...it's my job to find someone who will.
Treason is part of the corporate strategy?
I asked who you were working for.
You didn't tell me.
My God.
Holy shit.
Christ.
Get her out of there.
What is this?
A camera?
I'm working for the FBl, William.
They heard everything you just said.
They're watching us now.
And you think that makes you safe?
You...
...have no fucking idea!
How could you do this to me?
I hope you understand, Lee.
You leave me no choice.
Wait a minute! Stop her!
Stop! Hey!
Go, go, go!
Hard evidence.
It's all yours, gentlemen.
We've handled these situations before.
You haven't answered my question.
We told you there'd be risks.
You told me I'd have complete protection the entire time.
It didn't go as smoothly as we anticipated.
That's an understatement.
Remember, Miss Cullen, you came to us.
I came to you with a clerical error.
You asked for my help.
And we got it.
If Cyrez is selling weapons' technology, that's high treason.
This disk and your testimony will put them and their co-conspirators behind bars.
You've done a great service for your country.
Now, it's time to think about your safety.
This is US Marshal John Kruger, of the Witness Protection Program.
He'll handle your personal security.
My protection?
Your new identity, relocation.
I'll take you through it step-by-step.
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.
You're in an extremely high-risk situation.
That should have been explained to you.
Your boss was just a middleman, Lee.
There are more dangerous people involved.
You expect me to give up my whole life?
Until the trial. Then you'll be completely out of danger.
And how do you know that?
How do you know?
Look, I will keep up my end of the bargain.
I will testify.
But that's it.
I'm going home.
Put people on her right away...
...or we'll need a seance for her testimony.
Who brought her into this?
She volunteered.
She had security clearance...
You told her it's a walk in the park.
When she finds out her life isn't her own anymore, it's too late.
We had no case without her.
It's easier to put her ass on the line than yours, isn't it?
Sully.
Frediano, how're you doing?
Good. I have something for you.
Let's see.
Your receipt.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
It's me.
Your music has arrived.
Get Mr. Morehart down here.
- It's me.
- Lee?
I heard about Donahue. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
- I shouldn't have trusted them.
- Of course not. The Feds are idiots.
They'll blow the case or bury it.
The Feds are here.
They're watching me.
Let me write this story and I'll nail Cyrez all over the front page.
It may not be safe to talk on this phone.
I'll call you later.
Wait. Did you make a copy?
- Yeah.
- That's your insurance, Lee.
Go public. They won't dare touch you.
Lee, what's wrong?
I don't know. I got to go.
Hi, baby.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you. How are you doing?
So you just let yourself into my house?
I've been worried about you.
I haven't heard from you in days.
There's nothing to talk about. It's over.
You know that.
Come on.
That doesn't hurt you to say that?
It hurt me three months ago.
But after the phone calls, after the notes on my car, and tonight...
...it's getting a lot easier.
Get down.
Who're you seeing?
Come on, Darryl.
I know you're seeing someone.
Let's see who that is.
What's this?
And a card.
Get down!
Oh, shit! Go, go, go!
Come here!
Stay down.
I don't have a shot.
You, go, go.
- What are you doing?
- Lighting a fuse.
- Are you hit?
- What?
Are you hurt, are you bleeding?
I don't think so.
- Are they following us?
- No. Just calm down.
You'll be fine.
I'm not fine.
They tried to kill me!
Darryl's dead.
You're alive.
And I'll keep you that way.
Your hand.
There's a first-aid kit under your seat.
That weapon, or whatever it was...
...was from your company, wasn't it?
It's an E.M. prototype.
It's not supposed to exist.
E.M.?
Electromagnetic pulse.
No gunpowder, no conventional bullets.
They fire aluminum rounds at almost the speed of light.
A rail gun.
Yeah, that's another name for them.
The Navy's been working on them for years.
The smallest one I've heard of is mounted on a battleship.
Cyrez was contracted to scale them down...
...to design a compact, hypervelocity pulse weapon.
The most powerful assault rifle on earth.
They took millions, then said it was impossible.
They looked real enough to me.
Maybe Cyrez found a higher bidder.
They're connected everywhere:
Defense, CIA, NSA...
...maybe even your people.
Still want to put them away?
Yes.
I'll hide you until the hearings.
No one will know where.
Not my boss, not WITSEC.
No one.
Can you do that?
The Feds knew it'd be a death sentence for you, and let you walk right into it.
I was stupid.
You trusted them, that's all.
Now, trust me.
This is Morehart.
We have a problem.
Go ahead. This line's secure.
The Cullen woman is still alive.
Are you serious?
It gets worse.
She has a disk.
She tried to access our program with it.
Do you have any idea the risk I took to get this back?
I know. She must have made a duplicate.
Then get it.
Whatever it takes!
Understood.
One other thing.
- I checked her phone records.
- And?
She called a woman named Isaacs.
A reporter for the Washington Herald.
I see.
You know what has to be done.
Do it.
The Joint Chiefs are ready,
Mr. Undersecretary.
I'll be right there. Thank you.
That's it. That's everything I am.
That's nothing.
It's a few numbers and some plastic.
What you are is in here.
No one can take that from you.
They'll try.
We'll stop them.
I need the rest.
That's all.
No. This.
This?
It's St. George.
It's silly, but when I was a kid
I used to have nightmares about dragons.
He watched over you.
Yeah.
Well, that's my job now.
Get some sleep.
We'll leave at dawn.
Okay.
'Night.
There's a place I know, where it's easy to disappear.
There's a woman there I helped.
She testified against the yakuza bosses in San Francisco.
Her new name is Mei-Ling.
You'll be safe with her until the hearings.
Your new name is Deborah Elliott.
You think of me as a "Deborah?"
I don't know.
I could have used something more fun, like...
..."Debbie?"
"Deb?"
Deborah's fine.
AAA credit.
What's my limit?
It is not a license to shop.
I want you to lay low right now.
Mei-Ling will take good care of you.
You know the signal.
911. I get out of the apartment.
Go straight to the pay phone and wait for my call.
It's a public place, with six exits and six ways out.
And...
...I work alone.
If anyone comes to you and claims I sent them...
...use this.
You just pull the trigger.
I guess I won't see you again.
If everything goes well... no.
At least not until the trial.
Thanks.
Thank me when it's over.
Undersecretary of Defense, Daniel Harper...
...spoke before Congress today about the Cyrez scandal.
The use of private contractors is within the parameters...
...of Defense Department spending.
I look forward to the Cyrez hearing.
I'm confident...
...we'll be vindicated of any mismanagement of funds.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity.
Thanks for coming.
You know I don't like meeting outside our normal channels.
It's not my choice.
Are they with you?
Yeah.
Whether I like it or not...
Listen, John...
...we've got a problem.
What's going on?
Someone's murdering our witnesses.
We've got three confirmed kills in the last 48 hours.
- Who?
- Not one of yours.
Not one of mine. Not yet.
- Did they break cover?
- No.
No, that is the problem.
And there's no way anyone could know all three of their locations.
There's a mole inside WITSEC.
Beller thinks so. He may be right.
All three singers were witnesses in some high-profile federal cases.
All with international ties.
That's our common thread.
Other singers fit the profile.
Six.
One's yours and one's mine. So...
...we have to replant them immediately.
The jet is fueling as we speak.
I work alone.
You know that.
Not today.
Beller's orders.
Buddy system, CIA escorts...
...three teams. We're one of them.
Fine.
We do yours first.
This is John Kruger.
These are agents Schiff and Calderon.
I forgot which is which.
- I'm Schiff.
- And I'm Calderon.
Know her?
Should I?
She was doing a piece on Cyrez. There could be a connection to your witness.
Did someone take her out?
Peeled her like an onion.
If she knew anything, she talked.
This here is Deputy Monroe.
He's one of ours.
Monroe, you're looking at a legend:
Mr. John Kruger.
- Deputy.
- Sir, it's a pleasure.
Nice rig.
- How many of these you got?
- Three.
Different parts of the country.
Handy for quick relocates.
Sometimes we run violent felons for the Feds.
Chauffeurs for degenerates.
Don't you get tired of babysitting scum?
Yeah.
But in your case, we'll make an exception.
Who the hell does he think he is?
He thinks he's the best guy in the game.
I think he's right. Try not to piss him off.
You're east.
You're west.
You're north. Here.
We've got the boathouse, garage, back door.
We take the front entrance?
You and me, buddy.
I don't want to get shot today.
Keep your safeties on.
We'll probably find her inside baking muffins.
This is my witness.
Her name is Allison.
She's a very nice lady.
Let's bring her out safely.
Here you go.
Let's go, big guy.
The engine's still warm.
Shut up!
You're early.
You're late.
Hush, now.
He won't hurt you anymore.
Get an ambulance!
Go on!
Sorry, honey.
We lost her.
Why send five men to kill one woman?
They were waiting for us.
We've been set up.
Is she yours?
Call her now.
There are no phones.
We must live-contact her.
Where is she?
Atlanta.
Let's move, then.
Here. You'll like this better.
Are you all right?
I think so, sir.
First time under fire?
It's okay to be shaky.
Hell, I'm shaky.
The thing is, sir...
...I don't know what I feel.
It was terrible and...
Exciting at the same time?
Nothing to be ashamed of.
It's perfectly natural.
Tell him.
It's natural.
The whole game's that way.
It's like a drug. You get hooked, there's no turning back.
Take me.
My old man...
...a little nobody in D.C.
Nice, quiet guy.
Anyway, on his deathbed...
...he tells me that all those years he was working for the CIA.
I had to be part of that world.
I joined the CIA, couple of years... now I'm at WITSEC.
Hey, buddy.
What about you, sir?
Why did you join WITSEC?
Sir, is something wrong?
Answer the kid.
Go ahead.
Sir?
Come on.
You.
What the hell is going on?
He cleared the numbers.
What the hell?
Quiet.
Did you capture that call?
Got it. New York prefix.
Taxi!
City Zoo.
New York. Tell him to change course.
- I'll call WITSEC.
- No, that won't be necessary.
We must report flight-plan changes.
Monroe, you did great work back there.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Did I give you your evaluation yet?
Evaluation?
A- plus, kid.
Damn it! Get me a Wet-Nap or something!
Who's in New York?
Four or five guys we can trust.
Get them ready.
Clean this mess up.
Confused?
New York.
You're off course.
No, we're not.
You're going to take us to her.
You did a very, very bad thing.
You killed Monroe.
Now that makes you the mole.
That makes you a murderer.
Easy, Big John.
I'm a businessman.
A very, very serious businessman.
Businessman?
Selling weapons with your old CIA pals?
Is it just the money?
Trying to start your own dirty, little war somewhere?
Wars?
Wars, John?
Wars come and go.
We did Nam, we lost.
We did the Gulf, we won.
What changed?
Nothing.
Nothing ever does.
The only difference is who gets rich and who gets dead.
Personally, John, I prefer rich.
You must be a very rich man by now.
It doesn't have to end like this.
I can make you part of it. A big part.
Just give up the girl. What do you say?
Drop your gun.
What?
If you drop your gun now...
...I promise I won't kill you.
I'll have to take my chances.
You nailed me with this cheap piece of mail-order shit!
Think about it!
You jump, you'll go through there like shit through a goose!
You're right!
Engine fire!
Turn this thing around!
I'm trying to keep us in the air!
Turn it around and take him out! Now!
I want his face all over this windshield.
Oh, man. Did that hurt?
It had to hurt. I saw it.
Where is this?
Earth.
Welcome.
Is that your daddy's truck?
Think he'd mind if I borrow it?
I don't know.
Is this yours?
Like it?
Yeah.
What about a trade?
Fifty bucks.
Fifty bucks?
Shit.
We traced her to Chinatown, but she was long gone.
No shit, Dick Tracy. That was a run signal.
The cab companies?
Three pickups of solo women within 15 minutes of the call.
Drop-offs?
Madison and 53rd.
89th and Central Park West.
New York City Zoo.
- That's it.
- The zoo?
First a run signal, then straight to a public meeting place.
- Your shooters?
- Standing by.
I want two teams to sweep from the north and the south.
Go!
Ladies and gentlemen, the zoo will be closing in ten minutes.
Miss Cullen?
Ma'am, I'm here to help. I'm a US Marshal.
Where's John Kruger?
On his way. He sent me to be sure you're safe until he gets here.
Really?
Then he showed you the secret handshake?
Shit!
DeGuerin!
The bitch just shot me!
We're on our way. Don't kill her.
Do you hear me?
What's going on?
US Marshal. Close all exits.
People are inside.
Get them out, now!
Let's go.
You two, here.
Everyone, please exit the zoo.
Let's go, immediately!
Police emergency! Thank you!
Come on!
He's here.
Hold your fire!
Lee...
...just drop your weapon.
Move!
- You're late!
- Traffic.
- How's your ammo?
- I'm out.
Damn it! Two rounds left.
Move!
Ready to go?
Stay down. When I tell you, head for the door.
Go.
Let's go.
You're luggage.
How many casualties?
Three. Kruger took them out like that, cold.
- I can't believe this.
- His prints were on the weapon.
You've run prints on him already?
That's moving fast.
I was there. I saw it.
Why would he do a thing like this?
Look...
...the man has nothing to keep him honest.
He's been bought.
I've known John for years.
We're losing time.
If he's innocent, why's he on the run?
And his witness?
She's in it with him.
What the hell do you mean?
We identified ourselves.
She shot one of my men.
Fine.
Do whatever it takes to bring him in.
Robert?
Sir?
Bring him in alive.
Captain?
Put out a citywide APB.
Lock this town up so tight it'll make his balls ache.
Beller.
- Captain.
- John, where are you?
DeGuerin is the mole. He killed the others to flush out my witness.
Come in.
I must protect my witness!
You'll put her in danger.
You'll both end up dead.
DeGuerin has been bought.
My witness knows too much.
Federal agents say you are the shooter.
I'll call you back.
When?
When I have proof.
It's gone too far.
We're on our own.
What can we do?
We can't stay on the run for long.
We need some hard evidence.
You kept a copy?
I was supposed to give it to a friend of mine, a reporter.
- She asked me...
- Claire Isaacs?
How did you know?
She's dead.
They killed her.
How could they have known?
- I didn't tell anyone.
- I know. It's not your fault.
They probably tapped her phone.
There are many ways...
Everything's going to be all right.
I was just trying to cover myself.
I didn't know who I could trust.
Now, I'll get us both killed.
No.
This may be all that keeps us alive.
I don't even know what's on that.
We'll find out.
It's completely hacker-proof.
There's no way to run it outside Cyrez.
Then we'll run it from the inside.
It's like a fortress. We can't go back there.
They'd expect that.
I'd hate to disappoint them.
The streets are clear. The police have returned to the safety of their donut shops.
This is Father Rodriguez.
Pleasure.
I was not always Father Rodriguez.
I was born again, with a little help from our friend.
His Colombian associates wanted to introduce him to God personally.
I've been given a second chance at life.
This time, I'm using it for God's work.
Anything else I can do?
We need a car. Just for a day or two.
Done.
It burns as much oil as gas, but it's yours.
You sure about this?
There's no one else I can trust.
"It's raining men,
Hallelujah, it's raining men"
Hello, Johnny.
You!
I need to talk to you right away.
I've got one question.
Was it your idea to hook me up with the Village People here?
You're safe?
From the Mob, yeah.
No self-respecting wiseguy would be caught dead in a joint like this.
Do me just one favor.
Don't let on that I'm straight.
I don't want to break any hearts.
Trust me.
You said if I ever need anything,
I could come to you.
I need your help.
Wait. You need my help?
Now.
You got it.
Cover me for a few seconds.
I got to help a friend.
Who's he? He looks rough!
Don't start.
Do you two need a moment alone?
We're fine, thanks.
Just an idea.
Kevin just... worries about me.
Don't ask.
You want me to help you break into Cyrez?
Yeah.
You shitting me?
I thought I'd help you move a sofa or something.
Pull over up ahead.
I'll help you out.
All we'll need is some tanks, a few rocket launchers...
...and a set of balls like the King of Bayonne.
All you need are these.
I'll meet you at his place.
Do I look like I've got gas?
Gentlemen.
What's going on?
It will be contained in 24 hours.
Not good enough.
We have problems. They're solvable.
We must cancel the shipment.
Not an option.
What do we do with ten tons of assault weaponry that's not supposed to exist?
I am the eyes and ears of your world.
There's too much heat.
You don't get it.
The money has changed hands.
These are not the kind of people you cancel on.
Get those guns out of the country tonight or you're dead.
Now...
...how will you contain the situation?
Kruger has to show up at Cyrez.
I'll be waiting.
Why would he risk it?
The disk is the only thing that'll clear him and the woman.
This better work.
The disk. The girl. The guns.
By dawn, they don't exist. Clear?
Yeah.
Crystal.
The House Armed Services Committee announced that in two weeks...
...it will begin official hearings into the Cyrez scandal.
It's crawling with reporters.
We've got to keep a lid on this mess.
By tomorrow you'll be chuckling about this in your kiss-ass country club.
Who's running this camera?
I am.
This is James Haggerty, head of security.
Good.
We'll keep everything nice and low-profile.
Ever do any wetwork?
On three different continents.
To impress me, Slick, do your fucking job.
How many people do you have?
Twelve experienced professionals.
They'll do whatever it takes.
Plus 20 more on the security force, who'll follow orders.
Fine.
Make sure my man has your full cooperation.
We've got every possible point-of-entry under surveillance...
...from the rooftop to the sewers.
He's a ghost.
If he wants in, he'll get in.
Where's he got to go to run this disk?
The central vault.
No other terminal can access it.
If he wants to read the disk, there's only one way in.
Outstanding, gentlemen.
All we do is sit back and wait for Mr. Kruger to come to us.
Where are you going?
Take it easy. I've got a delivery for Blevens, 14th floor.
We can't accept any unauthorized deliveries.
"We can't accept any deliveries. "
I'm just messing with you, man.
Call Blevens to authorize it.
Pepperoni and cheese.
Maybe you don't understand.
This is a high-security facility.
You don't understand.
This is a Papa Genoche's pizza.
If he doesn't get it while it's still hot, he gets two free out of my pocket!
- I'm trying to save for a computer.
- Search him.
Get your hands off me!
Listen...
...I got a bad heart and a good lawyer.
Shut up.
He's clean.
Cheese and pepperoni.
Pal, hit the road.
I said, go!
What's going on?
Pizza delivery guy is having a seizure.
Who ordered a pizza?
This is all we need. Get him to the infirmary and call an ambulance.
- How're we doing?
- We'll be on the road in an hour.
They need to be rolling or I need to know why.
Yes, sir.
Come on! Let's move it!
They've been expecting you.
Infirmary is straight through the loading dock.
Is the patient stable?
I'm not sure. Hurry.
Thank you.
He looks stable. Give him some oxygen.
He's fibrillating! Code Blue!
No, it's okay!
Gel.
Clear!
This way. They're waiting for you.
Here we go again. Clear!
Increase the voltage.
Let's do it one more time.
Let's not.
You, over there, against the wall.
On the floor.
Face the wall.
On the floor.
My God! Terrorists!
You want terror?
You want some freaking terror?
I'll jump-start your ass!
Tape them up.
Face the wall!
Keep the room secure.
Can you handle that?
Get out of here!
Let's go.
We have a problem.
What is it?
- He's running the disk.
- Shit!
Impossible.
Any activity at Station 1?
All clear.
My ass! He's in.
He just didn't use the door.
Get your men down there, now! Go!
- What are you doing?
- No, I know this.
We change it every week.
Screw that. Get out of the way.
Check it.
Somebody talk to me.
He must be at a remote terminal somewhere in the building.
- You said he couldn't.
- He can't.
Donahue designed it so no outside activity...
Donahue is dead.
You'll wish you were too, if you don't find out what's going on...
...and you find out now.
- Holster your weapon.
- Take a hike, junior.
I said, holster your...
Some people take things for granted, like the ability to chew solid food.
I can find him.
How?
I'll scan the terminals, eliminate them one by one.
If he stays on-line, I'll nail him.
Do it.
How're we doing?
You were right.
Donahue left himself a back door.
But we still have to break his code.
We've got another five or six minutes until they trace us.
Recognize any of this?
No.
We're getting warm.
It's an accounting format.
Stop me if I get lucky.
How're we doing?
Eliminating low-clearance programs.
South wing is clean.
Two to go.
Two federal investigators downstairs want to talk.
Do what you've got to do, but get rid of them.
- You can't be seen here.
- I won't be. Go.
I need a chopper on the roof.
Right.
Those are offshore banking deposits.
"UBS." That's United Bank of Syria.
$52 million.
If it's an arms sale, it's a major one.
Let's see who their buyer is.
"Sergei...
"... Ivanovich Petrotsky. "
Who's that?
Bad news.
He heads a cartel in the Russian Mafia...
...selling drugs, guns and influence to very unpleasant people.
He's in the north wing.
Get moving.
Let's go.
- How much longer?
- I don't know.
Fifteen terminals are running secure programs.
You got five minutes.
Find them and call me.
Let's go.
There it is. Delivery date...
...tonight, midnight.
1,000 units for delivery at Baltimore Harbor.
1,000 units of what?
1,000 E.M. guns.
Are they insane? If these get offshore...
There will be a whole new era of world terrorism.
Got him. Twenty-fifth floor,
Donahue's office.
Scramble. Alpha Chief to the north wing, now!
They're on to us.
They're erasing the goddamn disk.
Come on!
I'll cover you. Meet me at the ambulance.
Go!
Lee, run!
Listen, John!
My rules now!
Mess with me, I'll slice her up and mail her back to you in little pieces.
Fire alert.
Fire alert.
This is not a drill. Please proceed to the nearest exit.
In this car I can get us to Baltimore in 40 minutes.
You're not coming with me.
I'll drop you off.
Don't give me this, "I work alone" shit.
You've already done enough.
This is not your fight.
Look, just indulge me for a minute, okay?
If it weren't for you...
...my tongue would be hanging on Canelli's trophy wall.
Look, you need me.
My cousin Tony runs those docks.
If your ship is there, he will find it.
You're short one envelope.
Infantino didn't pay.
What do you mean he didn't pay?
What'd he say?
He said, "Tell that fat fuck,
Tony Two-toes...
"... I ain't paying him another dime. "
I know that voice.
But it can't be him.
Not unless he's a ghost.
Boo.
Johnny C.!
You got whacked!
Must have been another guy.
Another guy rat on Canelli too?
Canelli's a piece of shit.
I got no love for Canelli, either.
But...
...this time you went over the line.
I'm still here.
What you did was wrong.
He got a drug dealer and his poison off the streets.
Who's the tree trunk?
This is the guy who saved my ass.
This is my cousin, Tony Two-toes.
That's Sal.
Little Mike.
Your funeral was absolutely beautiful.
Canelli finds out he's still breathing...
Screw Canelli. We got bigger problems.
Tell him.
There's a major arms deal going down.
A US contractor's selling out to international terrorists.
"Mr. 60 Minutes. " Tell me something
I don't know.
It will happen tonight on your docks.
That I didn't know.
Quite a lot of security.
Expecting trouble?
I'm a Boy Scout. "Always be prepared. "
Is that why she's here?
Just think of her as an insurance policy...
...in case someone crashes the party.
You're not telling me something.
Just a bump in the carpet.
Nothing for you to worry about.
Relax. You'll be out of here in 20 minutes.
What do I do with her?
Whatever you want.
Once you're in international waters, her policy expires.
Personally...
...I'd put a bullet in her head and throw her overboard.
It would be such a shame.
Don't even think about it.
I think and do what I like.
You will soon learn about this.
Last crate's on its way.
I'll leave you lovebirds alone.
DeGuerin...
This is Kruger. Get me Beller.
Start a trace on this.
I've got proof Cyrez is selling weapons on the black market.
Daniel Harper's in on it.
Undersecretary of Defense Harper?
Yes. DeGuerin is their facilitator.
He is the mole. It all goes down tonight.
Come and get me. Baltimore docks.
Pier 57.
Report.
Range is clear.
Not a creature is stirring.
Clear on the south.
Quiet on the east.
Listen up. This is the last load.
Keep your heads up and your assholes puckered.
If that son of a bitch is out there,
I want him.
Sunshine...
I want to talk to you.
This is a restricted area.
You're telling me.
What the hell are you doing here?
Excuse me?
We're from Local 129, sonny.
We heard you was loading a ship without the assistance of bona fide union labor.
Say it ain't so.
Sir, we have a situation.
You certainly do.
Stand by. We're coming to you.
What's going on?
Let me explain something to you.
Nothing moves off these docks without it getting loaded by the union.
I don't see no union people around here.
Do you?
This is a matter of national security.
Clear this area immediately!
Are you threatening us?
Absolutely.
What was that?
Gunfire at the warehouse!
Nobody screws with the union.
Perimeter, check in.
Talk to me!
We have a security breach.
Check it out! Get that crane moving!
Movement in the southwest corner of the warehouse.
It's nothing.
There they are.
Commie bastards.
Not Communists. They're a federation of independent, liberated states.
Don't make me hurt you, Mikey.
Keep your eyes on the guys on that crane.
Think I can hit that guy from here?
You're lucky if you hit the floor if you fell on it.
Got him.
Thirty yards.
Fry the bastard.
Jesus Christ.
Fuck me!
I think we got him!
He's toast!
I think we even got the roaches.
Royce, Somes, you're recon.
Bring me back the good news.
E.M. team, cover them.
Roger.
Come on, goddamn it.
Nice shotgun, asshole.
Schiff! Calderon!
They missed.
Johnny?
I'll be right out.
Open fire!
It looks as if your friend has arrived.
I'll enjoy introducing him to you.
I won't have the pleasure.
He's forced me to hasten our departure.
And yours.
Goddamn it!
Now you are pissing me off!
Drop the guns.
Now.
Thanks.
Shut up!
Take it up! Now!
Here. Grab the ladder.
Hold on.
Say good-bye, John.
Good-bye.
John, buddy!
Don't let me go like this.
Help me!
Son of a bitch!
Drop the gun!
Get him out of here!
Thank you, John.
Ready?
Let's go!
How does it feel to be indicted for treason?
He has nothing to say.
Marshal DeGuerin! What about you?
I'm proud.
You admit to treason?
I admit to patriotism.
Our actions stopped a secret alliance...
...this administration has had with some of our worst enemies.
The public deserves to know the truth.
When we have our day in court, they will.
They could get away with this.
If Morehart takes the fall.
You did well.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Ready?
Pretty impressive speech.
Learn to keep your mouth shut in front of the press.
It doesn't matter, anyway.
This will never go to trial without her testimony.
I'm not sure we should start again.
Why not?
With this bitch gone, we can spin-doctor ourselves clean.
What if she's been in contact with her friends, her family?
Fuck her family and friends.
I'll kill them one by one.
Next year, she won't even be a memory.
Robert, you never fail to amaze me.
Me? Thank you.
But I got to hand it to you, Danny.
That was brilliant work back there.
What?
The van.
It was beautiful, clean, swift.
There were witnesses to say we were never near it.
I like your style.
You know, you remind me of me.
I thought you set that up.
Didn't you...
What the hell's going on?
What is it?
Hello?
It's for you.
You've just been erased.
Oh, my God!
Let me out!
Break it!
Get off of me!
What happened?
They caught a train.
With My Pleasure

Police department, zone one,
Sergeant Roberts.
The search for the Polish Hill Strangler confines... in the wake of the discovery of yet a fourth victim this morning.
The nude body of Arlene Dunn of Mount Pleasant... was recovered from the Ohio River... by Pittsburgh River Rescue.
The police have been alerted to the crimes by the killer... who calls after each murder to play the song "Little Red Riding Hood".
The police brutality trial of Detective Jimmy Detillo... came to a conclusion yesterday... when the jury brought in a guilty verdict.
Defective Detillo was convicted for the May 20 beating of Leon Watson.
Watson remains in a coma in Mercy Hospital.
The key to the conviction was the surprising testimony... of homicide defective Thomas Hardy,
Detillo's partner and cousin.
Defective Hardy was present during Watson’s arrest... and testified that his partner used unwarranted force.
Sentencing is set for June 15.
Come on, son. We're gonna be late for the policemen's ball.
- You gotta face 'em sooner or later.
- I feel like an asshole.
Well, maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.
It's no wonder, growing up with a role model like you.
- You got that from your mother.
- Just leave Mom out of this.
- Gladly.
- I see you got the boat fixed.
Yeah. Putting it in the water tomorrow.
So, what's the latest on Little Red Riding Hood?
Nothing new.
We get close; he slips away.
We make a move; he makes a move.
I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop.
Maybe an ex-cop. Who knows?
Uncle Nick thinks so too.
You talk to Uncle Nick about Jimmy?
We talked around it.
Look, every cop in Pittsburgh thinks I'm a rat.
Why should Uncle Nick be any different?
You're not a rat.
You told the truth.
Nick knows that.
Yeah, well, look what telling the truth has got me.
I know what you're going through.
You know what my dad used to say?
Loyalty above all else... except honor.
All units, we're in pursuit of a murder suspect in a stolen '89 Ford.
Dark blue. License:
Robert Harry X-ray 715.
Oh, damn it!
We just crossed the 31st Street bridge.
Not today!
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Repeat: Armed and dangerous.
- Let's go.
Maybe I won't have to go... to this goddamn policemen's ball after all.
Take Bigelow.
Jesus!
Why don't you have a date tonight?
You're my date.
I didn't want you to be lonely.
- What happened to that nurse?
- Nothing. It just didn't work out.
You gotta give these things a chance.
You know, that girl that works for Dutch is awful nice.
Is there some meaning in all this, Dad?
Grandkids.
- What?
- Yeah.
Hell, I'm not that grown up myself yet, Dad.
- There they are.
- Go down the alley.
Jesus Christ!
We got fire and two officers down in the southbound tube. Send an ambulance.
We'll trap him at Second Avenue.
- Come here!
- Captain Hardy?
Get out of the car now, with your hands up!
Uncle Nick.
Excuse me.
Is this the policemen's ball?
Well, nobody's going to the party till we get this asshole out of the car.
This is your last chance.
Get out of the car with your hands up!
Here he comes.
Let's go!
Shit!
Hang on.
He drives like a cop.
Pull up to him.
All right. Come on, fellas. Easy.
Jesus Christ! Take it easy.
Watch the leg.
- Jesus Christ! My leg.
- You're all right.
- Easy, pal.
- Something's wrong with my leg.
- Where's Dad? Where's my dad?
- Tommy, listen.
- Oh, no!
- He's been shot, Tommy.
The killer got away.
Oh, Daddy! Oh, Jesus Christ!
Look who's here.
- Sorry about your father.
- Thanks, Don.
Just couldn't stay away, could you, Tommy?
You even had to come to the goddamn sentencing.
Wasn't bad enough you testified against your partner?
What, did you come down here to gloat, you prick?
Hey, Uncle Nick.
Hi, Tommy.
How you feeling?
I don't know.
How's the leg?
I don't want to be here, Uncle Nick.
You're a better man than I am, kid.
- They got your father's killer.
- What?
They're bringing him up for arraignment right now.
What is this?
His name is Kesser.
What the hell is this?
He couldn't even lift those women.
We have an eyewitness who saw him dump a body.
What the hell is going on here?
Even you said it was a cop.
I said could be. Now we have a witness that said it wasn't.
When were you gonna tell me?
Hey, Dad.
Come on. Let's go on in.
I'll be right with you.
Go ahead.
Sit down.
I'll be right in.
Now you listen to me.
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?
You should be glad we caught him.
Where is he?
A no-show at a police brutality sentencing?
They're gonna throw the book at him, your son or not.
Hear ye, hear ye.
The criminal court of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania is now in session.
Sentencing for the State versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.
All rise. The honorable
Judge Hellen Kramer presiding.
Mr. Gunther...
- where's your client?
- We don't know, Your Honor.
Jimmy, son, listen to me.
Listen to Daddy, all right?
Come down, and we'll go talk to them.
I promise.
We'll work something out.
Mama went off this bridge.
You remember?
Never found her.
Come on, Jimmy.
You don't have to do this.
Cops don't go to prison, Dad!
I don't go!
Jimmy, we can work this out.
What are you doing here?
You gonna give him a push?
It's my partner.
My flesh and blood!
Come on down, Jimmy.
You're scaring everybody.
Yeah?
Jimmy, don't!
Who's the best cop now, huh?
You, Jimmy.
Always you.
Who's the best cop now?
Always you, Jimmy.
Come on, Jim.
Come on down.
Come on, partner.
Just take my hand.
You motherfucker, Tommy!
You did this!
Come on, Danny.
Let go of him!
Fuck you! You did this, you motherfucker!
Oh, Bob.
Don't lick me with that fish breath.
I think he's still on the sauce.
He's probably sleeping it off somewhere.
He doesn't know what "quit" means.
He's a fifth generation cop. He'll show.
Oh, yeah?
Who wants to bet, huh?
Twenty bucks says he don't show.
- Hey, take it.
- You're on.
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Tie that up for me, will you?
Hardy!
I've been calling you for a fucking hour!
You missed roll call.
Penderman's really pissed.
You look like shit.
You fall off the wagon again?
It's five o-fucking-clock, man!
You're a fucking mess!
I'm sick of taking shit for you.
What am I supposed to put in the log?
You wanna get that stern line?
You're a real asshole.
You know that?
All the guys in the division, and I draw this prick.
Shit.
You bastard!
Get some dry clothes on, Sacco.
I'll catch you on the next run.
Goddamn it!
This is River Rescue.
We have a seven...
River Rescue 9221, this is Base.
We have a 1-11, Shenango Works.
One mile south of Neville Island, north shore.
Ten-four.
Kim Lee, get Hardy.
River Rescue 9221, this is Base. Come in.
9221. Go ahead.
Hardy, this is Penderman.
I want you to get back here... and pick up Sacco.
Malfunction on his radio, sir.
Like when you shut it off.
- Jeff Schultz. Neville Township.
- Tom Hardy.
- Where's your diver?
- He fell off.
Open it up.
Stand back, please.
Shot in the pump.
Small caliber.
- Been in the water 48 hours.
- Less.
Twenty-four hours.
She's been dead 48, though.
Somebody held onto her.
Thank you, Jack fucking Webb.
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Tom Hardy.
The infamous.
Hi, Sid.
- Hey, Captain.
- Hey, Uncle Nick.
How are you? What do I have to do to get you to call me, huh?
I call you, Nick.
Your phone's always busy.
- Danny is back.
- You're kidding.
Where was he?
California someplace.
- What'd he say?
- Nothing much. You know Danny.
- So how are they treating you?
- Good.
- I heard Rossmore is retiring.
- Yeah, that's what they say.
You gonna be the next chief?
Not me, kid.
I'm just a Larimer Avenue dago.
I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.
Yeah. That's what they do with killers.
I'll see you around.
Come on. Let's go.
You know, Sid, when I grow up, I would love to have a pair of shorts like that.
- How's the wife, Eddie?
- None of your fucking business.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
How would you know?
Hey, you're his partner.
How's his wife?
Let's go, you motherfucker!
Right now!
- Jimmy was my friend, man!
- Eddie's picking on me, Uncle Nick.
- Nobody's gonna forget what you did!
- Shut up, Eddie!
One of these days, it's gonna be just you and me!
You belong on the river, you fucking rat!
Workers discovered the victim earlier this evening in the Ohio River... near the Shenango Steelworks, her nude body wrapped in a sheet.
Police have identified her... as Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.
Police defectives say that Miss Putnam, a stewardess for Trans East Airlines... was apparently forcefully abducted from her own apartment... before being taken to another location, where she was murdered.
The brutal crime reminds many Pittsburgh residents... of the Polish Hill strangling two years ago.
Homicide defective Edward Eiler had this to say.
There's absolutely no connection here... other than the victim of a female Caucasian persuasion.
The Polish Hill victims were strangled.
Cheryl Putnam was shot at close range.
Douglas Kesser maintains his innocence...
Don't move.
You picked the wrong house to rob, asshole.
Who are you kidding, Tommy?
You ain't got nothing worth stealing.
It's been a long time.
That's a good way to get yourself killed.
I wanted to surprise you.
You surprised me.
Give me a drink.
I almost broke my neck out there.
I don't know why you want to live in this fucking houseboat.
You and your old man should've burned this thing down.
- Thanks. All right.
- How was California?
Sunny.
- Sunny?
- Yeah.
After two years, that's all you can tell me?
"Simpsons" are on an hour earlier.
You still mad at me?
Yeah, well, I fucked up.
After that night on the bridge,
I blamed you for Jimmy.
Yeah, I blamed me too.
I looked for you at the funeral.
Ah, I couldn't deal with it.
Another funeral with an empty coffin like my mom's.
Fucking river took half my family.
Never get 'em back, either.
Oh, wow.
I was wondering what happened to that picture.
You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin.
All gonna be cops like our dads.
Yeah. Brilliant idea.
Look at us now.
I mean, I'm a dropout,
Jimmy's dead... and you're one of those, uh, what do you...
Water dogs.
It wasn't your fault what happened to Jimmy.
No, really.
He had something wrong with him.
No, he did. Like my mom.
And nobody noticed it... till he beat the shit out of that suspect.
But I noticed it.
I never did anything about it.
- You did the right thing.
- Bullshit.
You did the right thing.
Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em.
So you back now?
You here for a while?
Oh, I'm back.
You wanna get something to eat?
No, I gotta meet a girl.
I'll see you later, man.
Welcome home, man.
Hey, Kim Lee.
How you doing, Hardy?
- Who's Christman?
- Jo Christman, new diver.
What's he like?
Not what you expect.
Come on in, Tom.
Tom Hardy, Jo Christman, your new partner.
She's a police officer.
Also qualified as a diver and a paramedic.
Hi. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Is this a joke?
Can I ask you what he said?
Thanks.
I hope she floats.
Want to get that stern line, please?
Shit! Put it down!
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.
Give me the bottle.
Let me rephrase that.
Give me the bottle now.
You know this is a "no wake" zone?
No, sir, I didn't.
It is.
Drive a little slower next time.
- Wait. We have to give them a ticket.
- No, we don't.
Yes. They were speeding.
We have to give them a ticket.
Well, you better do it, then.
I'm not sure I can stand the excitement.
Excuse me, sir.
I need your registration.
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.
Take the wheel.
Keep heading upriver.
Switch to channel eight.
Tell Penderman to send backup.
Get outta here.
River Rescue, this is 9221. Over.
Land shark.
Willy?
How many men upstairs?
Let me rephrase that.
- Two, plus the pilot.
- Close your eyes.
Just close 'em.
Do you think we're stupid?
Where's the rest of the money?
Where's the 200 grand?
I say the word, he blows your head off.
You hear me?
Pittsburgh Police.
Now, we have two choices here.
You either put the guns down... or we all start shooting.
I'll blow his brains...
- Hey, man!
- Hey, come on. Untie us!
Get us outta here!
Hardy, behind you!
Thanks, Dutch.
Hey, you did really good out there tonight.
Thanks, Hardy.
Really good.
Thanks.
I never had a woman partner before.
Neither have I.
What a night.
You guys are understaffed.
Oh, no, baby.
This is the new "efficiency" system.
- See you tomorrow.
- I switched with Mary Jane.
Todd has Pirate tickets.
See you Wednesday.
Goddamn it.
Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this, goddamn it?
Answer me!
What are you doing here?
The bars closed?
Just visiting some old friends.
You don't have any old friends down here.
Who would know that better than you, huh, scumbag?
Yeah, "old friends".
Goddamn it.
Motherfucker. Nick, he was in the Polish Hill files.
Listen, Tommy.
What are those?
- What?
- That.
- This?
- Yeah.
Nothing. Some papers.
There's an old Italian saying: Don't scald your tongue on another man's soup.
Yeah, there's an old Irish saying:
Never listen to old Italian sayings.
I knew this was gonna happen.
The minute I seen you at that body,
I knew it was gonna happen.
You won't let go.
You want me to go lay in some bed for the rest of my life?
My father's in the grave two years.
The guy that killed your father is wasting away in West Penn.
Bullshit! A cop killed my father, and you know it.
Kesser never had the brains for this.
Why did you roll over on him?
He was convicted by a jury of his peers, based on evidence...
- Why won't you answer me?
- I'm telling you!
I loved your father, and I love you like a son... but your father is dead and this case is closed.
If you can't accept that, that's your problem. But I'm telling you something.
I can take that gun and that badge away from you right now... for initiating an illegal investigation.
Is that what you want me to do?
Is it?
Do what you gotta do.
We're out of our patrol zone.
Will you at least tell me where we're going?
I'm gonna go visit a friend.
I'm gonna break here for dinner.
I'll be back.
Right.
I'll just stay here and watch the boat.
Get you something?
I'm looking for a guy named Chicanis.
I haven't seen him all night.
Chick! Hey!
Now you're gonna tell me what you know.
Who told you to lie?
- I didn't lie.
- Say the fucking name... or say good-bye, motherfucker!
- Don't shoot me.
- Hardy!
- Put up your gun.
- Now!
No, Hardy.
Put up your fucking gun.
Goddamn it!
This shit has got to stop.
- If you have a drinking problem, fine.
- I wasn't drinking.
- You're out of control.
- I wasn't drinking.
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?
- What?
- How many years have you been a cop?
- One year? Two years?
- Long enough to know the rules.
Maybe you overlooked the one about partners backing each other up.
From what I hear, you have no business... telling me how partners should treat each other.
I'm supposed to watch you put a gun to someone's head?
- I wasn't gonna shoot him.
- What were you gonna do?
I'm trying to solve a murder.
What murder?
I hate to break this to you... but you are not a homicide detective anymore.
River Rescue 9221, this is Base.
Come in.
- Go from Hardy.
- We got another 1-11.
North shore, River Park, east of Glenwood Bridge.
Get the bowline.
Yeah, this is Hardy.
9221. We're on our way.
Let's go! Now!
Over here!
Oh, Jesus.
Mrs. Wilson, if the kids have any bad dreams, trouble sleeping... call this number, and we'll send a counselor... free of charge.
- Right.
- Probably want to get them home.
Kids, come on.
Let's go home now.
Why didn't you ask if they saw anything?
Because they didn't see anything.
The body was dumped upriver last night.
How do you know?
I used to be a homicide detective.
- Round up the usual suspects, Eddie?
- Keep laughing, asshole.
It's a sin what he turned into.
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
- We got a dead nurse.
- Jesus Christ.
You stay here. You understand me?
Don't move.
Absolutely, Dad.
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
What a prick.
Paula Puglisi.
She worked Mercy Hospital.
Same MO as the Putnam woman.
Guess who she used to fuck.
You knew her.
Yeah.
God, Tom, I'm sorry.
That guy you were chasing back there has something to do with this, doesn't he?
- He was a witness in a murder case.
- The Polish Hill murders?
Yeah.
I was one of the investigating officers.
Five women were strangled.
During a high-speed pursuit of the suspect, my father was killed.
Chicanis said he saw the killer dump one of the bodies.
You don't believe him.
This was the case where you lost your shield.
I lost my shield because I said a cop killed my father.
Want to give her one more pop before they take her away?
- How about I give you one more pop?
- Blow it out your ass, you lush.
Go keep the press out of Uncle Nick's face. That a boy.
That's enough, all right?
I thought you quit smoking.
Gum didn't work.
Who's she?
That's my new partner.
- Not bad.
- You didn't know nothing about that?
No. Why should I?
- Coming back to the force?
- Hell, no.
See what you're missing?
You want a little dinner?
We're going Italian.
- Big surprise.
- I told you to stay up there.
- I was inviting him to dinner.
- Go up there.
- I just wanted...
- Go up there!
He hasn't changed a bit.
That's the problem. Come over here.
I want to talk to you.
So what do you know?
Nothing. Dead body in the water.
We fished it out.
Please don't play games with me.
I'm tired.
- I'm not Homicide anymore.
- I still want to know what you know.
You don't want to hear what I got to say.
- Try me.
- It's the same guy.
The same guy as what?
Are you talking about Polish Hill?
- The woman had fair hair, good body.
- Your type exactly.
These women were shot, not strangled.
Both had neck bruises.
They were bound, wrist and ankle.
- How do you know?
- Check it out. Ask Eiler.
- Eiler told me you know her.
- A lot of guys did.
- A lot of guys weren't fucking her.
- Goddamn it!
What's the matter with you?
I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to solve this case.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Are you a cop or not?
You come up with some bullshit story linking all these murders together... and just because you say it,
I'm supposed to swallow it like tripe.
Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you seen this girl?
He's putting the bodies in the water so I'll find them.
- What?
- He wants me to find these girls.
You're crazy, you know that?
You're nuts.
He called me.
He called you?
- That's right.
- The murderer of these girls called you.
- What'd he say?
- He didn't say anything.
He didn't say anything because you dreamed it.
Now get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here.
Go catch a fish.
You're an alcoholic, and you need help.
This isn't a joke anymore.
If I were you, I'd see a psychiatrist, get my head examined.
Maybe you need a drink.
Might ease the pain of being wrong.
Get away from me.
Get out of my sight.
Didn't I tell you to keep those people out of here? Get them back up the hill.
Am I talking to myself?
Am I in this world all by myself?
Get them people back up the fucking hill.
Put Grandpa back on.
Yeah, she sounds good.
Yes, me too.
- Hi.
- Hi. You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
This is it. Sixteen months ago.
I didn’t do if.
I didn’t murder anybody.
This witness is lying.
He never laid eyes on me.
One member of the Pittsburgh Police
Department agreed with the accused.
Defective Thomas Hardy... didn't earn any new friends with this statement to the press.
No, I don't think Kesser is the killer.
I think he's the patsy.
There was information not admitted in this case that should have been.
What information?
All of the women were stunned with police-issue tasers.
Two of the women were called from police call boxes.
- Shut up.
- They were abducted from areas... where police response time is slowest!
- Why didn’t you say that?
- Get him out of here!
Because a Pittsburgh cop did if, and you know if!
An official police report denied Hardy's accusations.
As for Douglas Kesser... the controversy has not changed the outcome.
He has been sentenced to death in the electric chair.
Airtight case.
Kesser was a drunk, drifter.
No alibi. He confessed to the murder of a man we believe was his accomplice.
Said it was self-defense.
He denied any connection to Polish Hill.
However... we recovered evidence from the murdered women in Kesser's motel room... along with the gun that killed Vince Hardy.
Why does Hardy think Kesser was framed?
We got Kesser on an anonymous tip.
Kesser's fingerprints weren't on the gun. It was a police special.
Serial numbers were filed off.
So Hardy starts barking conspiracy.
He thinks the killer's a cop.
Did anybody else think Kesser was innocent?
Yeah. Kesser.
Well, Bob... he's either putting them in the Allegheny or the Monongahela.
Narrows it down.
This is Hardy here. Go.
It's Jo. I was wondering... if you're going to the policeman's ball tonight.
I'm gonna go.
I don’t really know anyone... so maybe I'll see you there.
Yeah.
- Don't leave me...
- One drink. I'll be right back.
- What the hell is he doing here?
- You believe the nerve of that bum?
He's got a lot of balls coming here.
Captain. He's here.
You look, uh, different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I didn't think you'd come.
Nobody did.
Hey, Tommy! You made it!
Good to see you, man.
- How are you?
- Come on. The whole family's here.
- I'm waiting for Danny.
- You can bring your friend.
Dad, look who's here.
What'd I tell you?
Let him go, Aunt Mary Ann.
We don't want to keep him waiting.
- Good to see you, son.
- Hi, Uncle Fred.
Ain't you gonna introduce your date?
She's not my date. This is my new partner, Officer Jo Christman.
Unfortunately, these are the Hardys.
This is my Uncle Fred.
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
- Yeah.
- You have to come to our house and eat.
- She's right. You're too skinny.
You gotta quit being such a stranger.
Now, since we're all together,
I'd like to propose a toast.
- To Vince Hardy.
- Hear, hear.
Best Captain of Homicide ever.
Let's drink to my mother.
She was a Hardy too.
And how about we drink to Jimmy?
Son, that's enough.
Come on, Daddy. It's fitting down here by the river, don't you think?
Uncle Vince is dead.
They're dead too.
You're gonna drink to him, you're gonna drink to them. To Jimmy!
- I said that's enough!
- No, it's not enough, goddamn it!
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off me.
Break it up, goddamn it.
You fucking idiot!
Get the fuck out!
Let go! I'm all right!
You don't belong here!
Me and you, Eddie.
Anytime, jack-off.
Come on.
Best day of the year!
Better than Christmas!
Are these policemen all your relatives?
No. They're just criminals dressed up like policemen.
How'd they all end up on the force?
Just part of some big, nationwide negative gene pool, I guess.
Don't do that, okay?
What?
That thing where you're not really talking to me.
It's not the answer.
Well, it'll do until a real answer comes along.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Get out.
Get out now!
You want to sit around here and have a few drinks... and feel sorry for yourself?
- Just go now, please?
- What is this?
You won't respect yourself until someone else does first?
Well, I respect you.
It took a lot of courage for you to walk in there and face the department... when you know they're waiting to see you fall on your ass.
- You're giving them what they want.
- No.
They want me silent.
Stupid is almost as good.
Go now, please.
Just go home.
No, I don't want to.
What are you doing?
What made you decide to become a cop?
I mean... why would you want to put up with all the horseshit you gotta go through... being a woman and all?
When I was in college, my roommate was raped.
The campus police were only interested in keeping it quiet... so I started poking around.
I knew the guy was white.
He was very tall.
So I started checking out the basketball courts near the campus... and I took pictures of all the white players.
She identified him from one of the photographs.
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.
This is the Pittsburgh
Police Department.
Pull the car over now and stop the engine.
Stop the car now, or I will shoot.
Take the wheel.
All units, this is River Rescue 9221, in pursuit of a murder suspect... heading west on the railroad service road.
Mile 16 of the Monongahela.
Suspect is driving... a blue sedan, is armed and dangerous.
Send backup.
All units, respond.
Shit.
Hold it steady.
What are we looking at here?
Oh, my God!
It's definitely a rug.
Way to go, Hardy, you asshole.
I told you it was a fucking rug.
Congratulations.
I'm proud of you.
We're all very proud of you.
You chased away a litterbug, blew up his car and recovered a carpet.
- It looked like a body.
- You might consider a career change.
Let's just say, for the sake of argument... that it was the killer, and it was a cop.
It would be very easy for him to figure out our patrol patterns, right?
Then he'd just be waiting for us to come along.
Exactly.
He dumps the rug to make us look like morons.
- It worked.
- Yeah.
- Hardy?
- Yes?
There's something I should tell you.
Are you really a man?
Good.
But I was married to one.
Cop?
Worse. A lawyer.
That is worse.
We have a daughter. She's four.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
Nice name.
Thanks.
Is that it?
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're partners.
Yeah. We should be taken out and shot.
We should shoot each other.
Too much paperwork.
I'm serious.
Maybe you should consider a career change.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
- There was another murder?
- Yeah.
Her name was Constance Cabrizzi.
Used to call her Connie.
You knew her too?
I took her to the prom.
Amazing coincidence, huh, me knowing all these girls?
You knew about the nurse.
Now you know about Cheryl.
And now Connie.
- You've got to tell someone.
- Who would I tell?
How would I know I could trust them?
- I don't know how high up this goes.
- What do you mean?
Imagine if I told the wrong person.
- You didn't do this.
- Why?
Because it's such an obvious frame?
Now I know why you've been so obsessed with this and with Polish Hill.
There is no "this" and "Polish Hill" like they were two separate things.
It's the same killer.
He killed those girls in '91.
He killed my father, and now he's killing women out of my life... and putting them in the river so I'll find them.
You're scaring me.
It's scaring me too.
All the women in my life keep turning up dead.
You are not listening to me.
I am telling you... that there is absolutely no connection between Polish Hill and these new girls.
If you print one hint of that in your newspaper...
I am knocking you off this beat.
You'll get shit from now on.
Good-bye.
Goddamn it.
The tip checked out. Hardy went to high school with the Cabrizzi dame.
That's two out of three.
If we dig, I bet we can tie him to Cheryl Putnam.
- You want me to bring him in?
- No.
Couldn't hold him with what we've got anyway.
We can put him under review.
I'm calling Internal Affairs.
You can't do an IA unless he's been under close surveillance for two weeks.
He's been under surveillance for three weeks.
- Close surveillance?
- Doesn't get any closer.
This is Detillo.
Thank you, Officer Sacco.
You may step down.
I'd like to call
Detective Emily Harper.
That's Jo.
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- Please state your name for the panel.
Detective Emily Harper.
You are a member... of the Internal Affairs Division of the Pennsylvania State Police, correct?
Yes.
Tell the panel, please... about your last assignment.
The assignment had two parts:
To rate Officer Hardy's competence as a member of the River Rescue division... and to monitor his unusual interest in the Three Rivers murder cases.
You state in your report that
Officer Hardy consistently ignored... his River Rescue duties to pursue an illegal investigation... into the Three Rivers murder case.
That's correct.
To what do you attribute
Officer Hardy's... unusual interest in this case?
He believes that the murders were committed... by the same man responsible for the Polish Hill murders two years ago.
A case he worked on.
- That's right.
- Mr. Chicanis... a prosecution witness in that case... reported that Officer Hardy assaulted and threatened him at gunpoint... and that you were forced to protect him by threatening Officer Hardy... with your own weapon.
No, that's incorrect.
I drew my weapon as backup.
Backup?
That's what I call it.
Officer Hardy was not... out of control and dangerous?
At no time.
- At no time during that...
- At no time whatsoever.
Officer Hardy is courageous and resourceful.
His values are the finest.
I just wish... we had more officers of his quality.
- Excuse me.
- That's my evaluation.
I was under the impression that's what you brought me up here for.
Thank you very much, Detective.
You may step down.
Ten-minute recess.
I'm sorry.
Why did you change your testimony?
Why do you think?
You cheat good.
Emily, it's your father.
Sorry we missed you.
Sarah just wanted to say hello.
She's enjoying her visit.
Mom and I will see you Sunday.
Bye.
Hi, Jo.
I mean Emily.
Never get used to that name.
I wanted to tell you it took a lot of courage... to do what you did today at the hearing.
Maybe we can talk.
Call me.
Yes, I know you're hungry.
Christ, you're always hungry.
Go catch a rat.
Let's see what our friends at Coast Guard have for us.
Let's see.
Cheryl is one.
Then Connie. That's 15.
And...
Nothing up there but cabins.
Jesus Christ.
Bob, will you get the...
This is Hardy here. Go.
Kim Lee! No!
God! It stops now!
Put your hands in the air, right now!
Where is she?
- What are you talking?
- Where's the girl?
- Where's who? Put that fucking gun down!
- Raise your hands!
- I got your fucking note!
- What note?
Jesus Christ.
The police brutality trial of Leon Watson ended today... with a guilty verdict for Detective James Detillo.
Detillo was convicted on three counts of assault and reckless endangerment.
The key to Detillo's conviction was the testimony... of Detillo's partner, his cousin...
Detective Thomas Hardy, a witness to Watson's arrest.
Surprised?
Hello, Jimmy.
I got ya.
I got you fucking good, didn't I?
Yeah.
Yes!
What a world.
It's really hard to believe, isn't it?
I jump off a bridge.
I don't die. Go figure.
And you.
Being so smart.
That must be a real comfort to you... especially at a time like this, huh?
- Jimmy.
- Shut up.
You shut your fucking mouth!
I loved you! You're my brother, and you betrayed me!
You betrayed me for this worthless piece of shit.
You knew I was the best cop!
- Say it!
- Don't! Stop it, please!
- Who's the best cop?
- Jimmy was the best cop!
- What are you doing?
- Poor Danny. It's all right.
Let's have a drink, huh?
Come on. Me and you, just like the old days.
Remember how we used to drink to old times?
Look at me when I fucking talk to you!
What's the matter?
You're a drunk, aren't you?
Come on! Drink!
Are you too proud to drink with a dead man?
Maybe I should drink with your little dove.
Would you like that?
- Leave her alone.
- Shut the fuck up!
So I'm killing all these girls.
He's riding next to me wondering,
"Who's doing it?"
We're investigating the crimes together, and I'm sitting... right next to my partner.
You have been a very bad boy.
You've been fucking your brand-new partner, huh?
Did you get fucked, honey?
Don't feel too special... because Tommy's made a career out of fucking his partners.
- Let this girl go.
- Shut the fuck up!
I'll kill you right now.
You see this, honey?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.
- Don't kill me!
I like this game!
You know why? Everybody dies, and they all die with Tommy's gun.
Now we got us a game.
- Say good-bye to her.
- Don't do it! Please!
Now we got us a game.
Say good-bye to her.
Put the gun down, son, all right?
Please?
Listen to Daddy.
- Put the gun down.
- What fun would that be, Dad?
It's over, son.
Put the gun down.
- Please.
- It's just starting.
Please!
I think Tommy has some questions for you.
Tommy? Comments?
Come on.
- Should I help him along?
- Don't, please.
You know your dad...
God bless his Irish soul... he was...
How should I put it, Captain?
- Please don't.
- He was sort of killed.
Captain, you want to tell Tommy who killed his dad?
Tell Tommy.
Tell him!
Don't move.
I'll fucking kill you.
Son of a bitch.
Get up.
You son of a bitch.
Get up!
Stop.
I'll kill you.
I'm your son.
Let me go.
- Freeze!
- No, Vince...
Stop or I'll shoot!
I'm sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
He was my son.
But it's over now... because we're going in together.
What are you gonna do, Dad?
You gonna shoot me?
Come on.
Shoot me.
Couldn't do it before.
You don't have it in you.
Shoot your own son?
There goes that gold watch.
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Who's the best cop?
A bulletproof vest!
Who's the best cop now?
You motherfucker! Come here!
Come on, Jimmy! Me and you!
Run, you son of a bitch.
I just want to talk to you.
Come on.
Why are you making me chase you?
Come on.
Are you mad at me?
Just shot my dad.
Call me.
No, I'll call you.
Fan out.
Coffey! Get these handcuffs off me!
- What the hell you doing handcuffed?
- Where's Detillo? What's going on?
Get these off!
Get up there. He's been shot. Get off!
I'm not getting off.
You son of a bitch!
Fuck!
Come on!
Watch your head!
Try to fuck me.
Get away!
Stop it!
You could never beat me!
- You like to jump off bridges?
- No. Of course...
Who's the best cop now?
You gonna be all right, sir?
- Can somebody take these off me?
- I need some handcuff keys.
I was a real shithead.
Guess you want to take a shot at me.
Wouldn't do any good.
On the other hand...
Hardy!
Hardy.
You okay?
Grandkids, Dad.
Hi. How you doing, sweetie?
Come on in.
I already prepared everything for you... just the way you like it.
Jeez, it's so hot tonight.
Are you ready?
You want me to play dead?
Do you want me to die, honey?
Please. Please, let me die for you.
Why did you close the windows?
You know I don't scream.
What are you doing, honey?
Is there something wrong?
What's that?
You're hurting me!
Get off! Oh, God!
Please, help me!
What do you know about the killer?
We know he's a male, probably aged...
Is there a possibility there's more than one killer?
No comment.
- You sound confident.
- I am.
- Do we know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.
We are analysing skin samples taken from underneath the fingernails of the victims.
Results will help to determine the killer's race.
Is it true the police aren't interested in finding the killers because the victims were prostitutes?
The suggestion that we're not treating this case diligently is not only false but offensive.
We've already spent
1,800 man-hours on this case...
What do you know about the killer?
I can't tell you all that we know, but he's male...
- You got the job. That job?
- Yeah.
Jesus.
That sounds disgusting.
Don't you think? Don't you think it's just disgusting?
All I gotta do is sit on my ass all night and read a book.
- You're drinking too much.
- He's already very drunk.
I think one person is responsible for these crimes.
- Why do you say that?
- That's my business.
That's all I got to do.
I just got to sit on my ass.
Sit on my ass!
Inspector.
Is it true the police aren't interested in finding the killers because the victims were prostitutes?
The suggestion that we're not treating this case diligently is not only false but offensive.
- Is there more than one killer?
- My feeling is one killer.
- Do you know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.
We are analysing skin samples taken from underneath the fingernails of the victims.
Results of those tests...
- Is there more than one killer?
- No comment.
Staying over tonight?
- Do you want me to?
- Do you want to?
If you want me to.
Marie, if I've ever done anything to make you happy, I truly apologise.
These markings could have occurred after death while the body was...
Sources have confirmed that the victims were sexually assaulted after their deaths.
Is there more than one killer?
It's gotten so hard to talk her into things.
She's become less and less... receptive.
- When will the results come in?
- Soon. Maybe tomorrow.
That guy's supposed to be amazing.
- We can't tell the public every...
- Receptive to what?
Were the victims sexually assaulted?
What do you think of the killer?
I think his time is running out.
Katherine!
Katherine?
I'm in the bathroom!
What?
Nothing.
You had strange dreams last night.
I did?
You were breathing really heavy.
You kept kicking your legs and moaning.
- You sure we weren't having sex?
- Pretty sure, yeah.
- Call me and tell me how it went.
- Yeah.
- Good night.
- Night.
Mr Johnson?
Mr Johnson.
- How did you get in?
- The front door was open.
Damn door never closes.
So, this is you?
- Oh, yeah, this is me.
- Welcome to Mars.
- Sorry?
- They weren't kidding you.
About what?
I'll leave you the coffee machine.
The radio is mine.
- You got a radio?
- No.
Get yourself a radio.
What did they tell you exactly?
Not a lot.
Now there's very few people around, but at night, this place is like Mars.
- So, what have you heard?
- Pardon?
What exactly did they tell you about me?
- Nothing. They told me nothing.
- Come on. They told you why I quit.
No, honestly, not at all.
May we come in?
Turn the key till you hear the click.
It registers on a piece of punch tape verifying you were here every hour.
- I see.
- Do you?
Thank God we don't need to check this room. The key's outside.
Come, have a look.
It's all right. Come on.
- You know what's in those tubs?
- No. What?
Smell the formaldehyde.
You can smell it, can't you?
You should never go in there. Never.
I never have.
Disgusting.
- So, I'll be alone here at night.
- Didn't they tell you?
Sometimes, an ambulance or police comes in, but apart from that, it's just you... and them.
The morgue.
I don't know why they put a key in there.
The hell with it.
Let's get on with it.
Just keep your eyes on the key.
Just keep looking at it.
Don't look at them.
Damned idiots. Why in the hell did they put a key in here?
What are the cords for?
Just a precaution, in case one of them wakes up.
- If you pull it, the alarm goes off.
- Wakes up?
Then you call the duty doctor from the guard's station.
He'll be here in five minutes.
Don't worry. It'll never happen.
It's cold in here, but you can still smell 'em, can't you?
Yeah.
Make sure the door doesn't close.
No handle on the inside.
- Why would it close?
- And turn out the lights.
This is where it happened, supposedly.
What?
Some years ago, scandal, terrible scandal.
Night watchman.
Many years ago... he did it.
- He did it?
- Did it with them.
- You mean...
- The guy had his very own harem.
Well, I never knew anything about it firsthand, but the rumour was, they caught him doing it.
They hushed the whole thing up.
Who knows? Lots of weirdos out here.
God.
I'm not a weirdo.
After you've worked here a while, your breath'll begin to stink.
You can test it by holding your hand up to your mouth and breathe.
Am I right?
Oh, Jesus! You're right.
Goes with the territory.
Nothing you can do about it.
These are the staff files.
We're all in here somewhere.
Dead ones, over there.
Staff, over here.
Meaningless.
Here's your duty roster.
You'll come on at eight, be relieved at four.
- Is that the alarm from...?
- It'll never happen.
Have you got a radio?
- Actually, I'm gonna study.
- Get a radio.
- Like I said, I'll get a radio.
- Good.
Who is that picture of?
I don't know. It's always been there.
Oh, one more thing.
There's nothing to be afraid of, but...
I think it'd be a good thing to have.
And then the radio...
It'd be a good idea to buy yourself a radio.
OK.
You have a choice of seeing two movies.
One, 90 action-packed minutes of two heroes spending time together having these incredible adventures.
The other movie has 45 minutes of one hero having incredible adventures and the other 45 minutes is a guy sitting at a desk, reading a book, OK?
Which one do you go see?
Who's playing the guy reading the book?
There is definitely loss of consortium, but how about mental anguish?
- What happened to us?
- What?
I can't breathe in here.
Why the fuck are we here?
- Getting older.
- We're dying.
- Same thing.
- No, no, no.
You know this movie
I was talking about?
The two heroes start challenging each other.
- Really?
- Yes. The one who backs down loses.
Why would they want to do that?
Because they're dying and they wanna play before they end up in bed with the establishment.
OK, so what are the stakes?
If I lose, I marry Marie.
You lose, you marry Katherine.
What?
- Why?
- It's some fun!
You are totally insane.
No, I'm not.
Shit.
Shit, the lights.
Weren't you afraid?
No. No. And then I saw these tubs.
There was something in them.
Spare parts.
I saw shadows or something.
I don't know.
That's really sick.
You're dead. What's it matter what someone does to you?
I just think it's sick, OK?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
So, listen.
Yesterday,
I'm down in Camden near Hyde.
I see this very attractive-looking girl standing at a bus stop, right?
But I notice she doesn't get on any of the buses.
So?
Come on, counsellor.
She was a prostitute.
Seventeen years old. Joyce.
How do you know all that?
Excuse me, those are my quarters.
I got the next game.
- Tough shit.
- All right, I'll get the manager.
I'm gonna go get Satan.
- It's OK.
- Sure?
Yeah.
Let us just play one game then you guys can play, all right?
Why you look so scared?
I'm just kidding. You all right?
What did you do to him?
Shake my hand.
I'll just play one game, OK?
I'm sorry.
Damn, baby.
Do fries come with that shake?
Please, get out of my way.
Maybe we should do something, huh?
Let me know if you're interested in nine inches.
I'm very interested in nine inches but not in fucking you three times to get it.
Such nasty things coming from such a pretty mouth.
Where you going?
Did I hurt your feelings? Bitch.
Hi. I hope our little altercation didn't interrupt your beer-drinking.
We were just discussing if we should do something.
- Let's go.
- No. We're gonna stay.
No, we're not.
I didn't mean you and me.
I meant me and Martin.
Just a little while.
- Assholes.
- I hope you know what you're doing.
You know, if this was the movie and you were playing the exciting guy... you'd go over and show those guys up.
James. James.
James!
Four, quadruple, Jack.
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready.
- For what?
- You challenged me.
I take it back.
We're not in grade school.
You can't take it back.
James, don't...
Excuse me.
Hi. I wanted to thank you.
What in the fuck is you talkin' about, fool?
I wanted to thank you. You know how long we've been looking for you two?
You're not telling me I'm the first person to approach you about this?
I'm serious. You guys are gonna be on talk shows forever.
- Talk shows?
- Oprah, Phil, Sally. You name it.
You like Ricki Lake?
What the fuck are you talking about?
When I say we've been looking for two guys like you, I mean it.
- No one's approached you about this?
- No, nobody's approached me.
That's unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.
You go on these talk shows - and there'll be a lot, you're gonna be on the road for weeks.
These guys will ask the same opening questions.
Maybe we should run through it now, just so you're prepared, huh?
OK.
Yeah? All right, great.
It's a multipart question, so answer carefully.
Now, we know for certain that your parents communicated through a series of clicks and grunts.
What we wanna know is how and when did you acquire the facility of speech?
All right? Were you the only one in your group to exhibit this facility?
And when did the majority of your body fur fall out?
Answer the third part first.
Sure.
Come on back. Let's play some pool.
Where you going?
- Non-verbal communication...
- You motherfucker!
- Let's do it. Come here!
- You can't be domesticated.
God! Did you see their faces?
That was great!
"When did the majority of your body fur fall out?"
Did you see them?
- Fuck!
- You all right?
- Goddamnit.
- Are you hurt?
Let's get out of here.
You know, I fucked her.
Who?
The hooker, Joyce. I fucked her.
You fucked a prostitute?
Jesus, what was it like?
It was fascinating.
She did everything I asked.
Everything.
I'd say, "Stand over there," she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "
I'd say, "Lay down," she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "
What?
- I told her I was you.
- You said you were me. Why?
How would she know who the fuck you are?
Back at the bar, you were excited by that.
It was a rush. You felt good.
You felt alive, didn't you?
- Yeah, sure.
- I didn't feel anything. Nothing.
A year ago, I would've felt like you.
I would've felt hyped up, flushed.
But, it's like my tolerance is increasing and I can't get that feeling any more and I have to get that feeling.
I just don't get that feeling and I need it.
I have to, too.
Do you?
Challenge me.
- OK, do it with Joyce.
- What?
- Do it.
- Yeah, yeah!
Come on. What, do you think this is just for fun?
And we invite her out, OK?
- Katherine.
- Katherine will never know. Come on.
Find an excuse, OK? Friend?
Buddy?
OK.
You told her you were me? Fuck.
Why do you have to rehearse in the morning?
Alan likes morning rehearsals.
- Yeah? Well, that guy's a moron.
- Well, he speaks highly of you.
Like I said, the guy's a genius.
- Come on. You know I can't be alone.
- You can.
You got bad breath.
Call me tonight.
You'll be asleep.
Wake me.
Shit.
- Did I scare you?
- No.
I'm sorry. Inspector Cray.
Martin Bells.
- You new here?
- Yeah.
- Law school?
- Yeah, yeah. Last semester, I hope.
That's fascinating for some reason.
It has something to it.
He's dead and he's going to die.
I think his name was Louis Paine, if I'm not mistaken.
Sitting on death row, waiting.
We could really use one right now.
- A death row?
- No, a murder.
Wait a minute. There's been another?
They're bringing her in now.
- Have you been in there?
- No.
- You should have a look.
- Nah.
No, you should. Otherwise you'll just be haunted here working at night.
Nothing cures a fantasy like a quick dose of reality.
You think so?
Go on.
OK.
Are you all right?
It was just feet. Just feet.
Yeah.
I've been meaning to ask what they do with them.
By the way, I saw you on TV.
Yeah? How was I?
- Are you on to him?
- We're getting closer.
How do you know it's just the one guy?
- Can I trust you?
- Well, yeah, absolutely.
Can I trust you with a bit of privileged information?
- Yeah.
- He has a signature.
- Signature?
- He takes their eyes.
- Good evening, guys.
- This one just quit smoking.
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies, this is the new night watchman.
- What's your name again?
- Martin Bells.
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies.
Bill, Bells. Bells, Bill.
Most people, when they see something like this, their immediate reaction is to ask,
"How could somebody do this and why?"
Even when we catch the killer, they want to know the how and why.
In movies or television, the killer always explains the how or why.
He always has some reason, however crazy. A mad gleam in his eye.
I've interrogated murderers like this one before.
Let me tell you, they are well beyond the need to justify what they do.
They just do it.
Explanations are just a fiction to make us feel safe.
Because if it can't be explained, then it's just meaningless chaos.
It could touch any one of us at any moment.
Which is exactly what it is.
I would have been sick.
I have a high tolerance for that stuff.
I still think it's weird.
- Why?
- You don't think it's weird?
Why shouldn't I see the body?
I work there.
How do you know it's the same guy?
Some of us just know.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I'm sworn to secrecy.
- Come on.
- I can't tell you.
Wait a minute. You can't tell me?
Katherine, you wouldn't want to know.
Believe me.
Jerk.
- Duty nurse.
- This is night watchman from 03.
- The alarm just went off.
- The alarm?
The alarm from the morgue went off.
- What was that?
- The alarm from the morgue.
- Oh, well...
- Well?
You should just go and check it, then.
The doctor will be there in about 30 minutes.
What! But what if it...?
Just go down and check it out and find the defect.
What if it's not a defect?
Don't worry. It is.
You crazy bastard! You're insane!
What the hell are you doing?
- Who do you think you are?
- I couldn't help it.
- I almost had a heart attack.
- But you didn't.
Christ, I almost shit myself!
How the hell did you get in here?
The front door doesn't close right and you're buried in that book.
I stood and watched you for five minutes!
You scared ten years off my life.
I called the duty doctor.
They're gonna think I've gone crazy.
You know, it's a really beautiful place you got here.
It's cosy!
I talked to Joyce.
Remember, your name is James.
I can't handle any more of your ideas.
All you have to do is show up.
I promise.
Dress nice.
Like I'm gonna tell Katherine
I'm dressing nice to study with you.
Tell her that we're studying opera.
Figaro. Figaro. Figaro.
You're a fucking nutcase!
That's Mr Fucking Nutcase to you, pal!
Kje kej je
It was my fuckin' alarm clock.
I'm sorry. What a shock.
- Can I offer you something?
- Excuse me?
Have you ever spent any time with the Zine family?
What?
Thorazine, Stelazine, Compazine...
No!
They're really very nice.
They will make you sing hymns while you watch a baby fall under a train.
No, thank you. I'm fine. Thanks.
Listen, we don't have time for screwed-up kids.
Just don't freak out again.
OK?
Those'll kill you.
Thank you.
She's probably not coming.
Impatience is an early indicator of boringness.
- "Boringness"? That's not a word.
- Here we go.
Joyce. Friend to the working man.
Good luck, James.
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I'm Joyce.
- I'm James.
Good evening.
Allow me to congratulate you both.
- Congratulate us?
- On your engagement.
Why, thank you.
- Would you care to order now?
- Sure.
I didn't get a chance to...
I think we'll have the cod fish.
- Very good.
- I don't like fish.
Oh, of course.
Well, the filet mignon.
How would you like those?
- Medium.
- Rare.
- Rare.
- Of course. Thank you.
So, where do you come from?
Home.
Oh, no, I meant...
San Diego.
Wow, San Diego.
- How did you get here?
- Walked.
No, I meant from San Diego.
Drove.
- Do you like it here?
- It's OK.
I was on my way to Nepal.
Nepal? Wow. What's in Nepal?
Monks.
Oh, right.
What are you doing?
Martin said
I had to do it right away.
Martin said.
You called?
No. Actually, we're fine.
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
What?
Excuse me. Can I have a word, please?
Just for a second.
You went too far this time, "Martin".
What do I... What do I owe you?
Fifty.
Cheers.
I don't drink. It makes me sick.
Really?
How much to drink a glass of whisky?
Twenty.
Twenty bucks? Yeah? OK.
Whoa, wait.
I didn't say how big it would be.
Bottoms up.
I guess you hear that phrase quite a bit.
Joyce, you're dribbling.
That wasn't part of the deal.
All right.
I'll give you $100.
$100, if you can tell me that you love me...
- I love you.
... and make me believe it.
- I love you.
- No, come on.
It's too fast. Didn't ring true.
I didn't believe it. Did you?
- I don't...
- OK, I'll add another 50.
That's all my allowance now.
It's all yours if you can make it sound real.
- I love you.
- No. Come on.
- I love you.
- No, make me believe it.
- I...
- Make it sound real.
I love you.
No.
I didn't believe it. Sorry.
How you feeling, Joyce?
OK.
- Why do you take all this shit?
- What's it to you?
- Tell us about your customers.
- Why?
Tell us about your clients, the weird ones. Tell us what they do.
- Why?
- Curiosity.
Answer the fucking question.
One dresses up like a baby and makes me change his...
That's not weird enough.
- One guy makes me pee...
- Weirder.
One guy makes me pretend I'm dead.
Yes!
He covers me in a sheet and puts a tag on my toe and then he...
Then he what?
- Then he...
- Then he what?
Tell us what's wrong, Joyce.
My friend, Leanne, brought the psycho home.
And?
And she...
They...
- I'd rather not.
- Tell us.
No. Please, can I go now?
Please, tell us.
They made me identify her body.
He took her eyes.
Could there be a relation between the guy that makes you pretend...
What the hell do you care?
Can I go now?
You think you've met him?
Can I go now?
How was your evening?
OK, you know. Typical James.
- I don't know how Marie takes it.
- Me neither.
Who's Joyce?
Joyce?
I don't know. Why?
She called late, asking for you.
For me?
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know who that could be.
Did she say what it was about?
No.
- She leave a number?
- No.
I don't know.
Here's Johnny!
And the question still remains, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what did the defendant know?
When did he know it?
And if he's so fucking smart...
- Hello.
- Have you been here?
- I can't hear you.
- Have you been here?
Come to think of it,
I'm not even home. Leave a message.
The boy who cried zombie.
Just you wait.
She's down there.
OK, which one was it?
Think you can still remember?
- It was the prostitute.
- Prostitute.
Well, good morning, Miss Singer.
This young man claims that you've been up and about.
Well, isn't that strange?
She appears to be as dead as a fucking doornail.
But I saw her there.
I saw her like I'm seeing you.
Hello? Miss Singer?
Hello! Is this thing on?
Still dead.
Listen. I saw...
- What's going on?
- Sorry, Inspector, but I thought
I might need some backup.
- Did you have a problem?
- Yeah! I saw this...
His problem is he's under-medicated.
I saw her in the hallway.
I've gotten rid of people for much less.
This is like one of those movies on the USA Network.
- What do you mean?
- The hero sees something weird and then no one will believe him.
You know, sometimes, Martin, when you get overly tired, the lines get a little blurry.
No, but I saw it.
- Now that guy thinks I'm crazy.
- No, no, no. Forget the doctor.
I think he has too much access to the medicines he freely prescribes.
You saw what you saw.
Here, Martin.
You can always reach me here.
Oh, OK.
Try and take it easy.
- Don't go back.
- We need the money.
We can borrow from my mother.
We don't want your family's money.
By the time my father was 22, he was married to a woman he didn't love and he was having an affair with the woman he did.
And what does that mean to you?
That he was afraid.
- Of what?
- Of life.
- Yes.
- Will you marry me?
Yes.
Shit, I hate that place.
Are you Katherine, Martin's...
Martin's girlfriend?
I can't... I know I'm supposed to memorise it, but I forget.
Maybe...
Maybe you could write it down for me.
You're not gonna give it to me until I remember. I know.
If you write it down,
I'll remember. I swear.
- Are you Katherine?
- Yes.
- Martin's girlfriend?
- Yes.
Please make him stop it.
Won't you please make him stop?
- Hello?
- Hello.
- How was it?
- We finished early.
What was that?
Let's get one thing straight, you shit. I'm not Marie!
If you wanna treat someone like James treats Marie, find somebody else.
What are you talking about?
- I met your little slave girl today.
- Who?
Joyce.
Yeah, go ahead, tell me she's some little lying junkie whore who makes up stories. Go on!
Look, I... I...
- Do you want me to play dead?
- What?
- You screwed her, didn't you?
- No!
No, it was just a game, I swear!
What did she say?
Do you want me to play dead?
Is that what turns you on?
What?
- Is that how you like it?
- No, Katherine.
Katherine, what...?
- What are...?
- Did you enjoy it?
Shit.
What?
Did you enjoy it?
- Excuse me?
- Did you enjoy it?
- Hello, Martin.
- Hi.
How are you?
I don't know.
Tell me, Martin, you did your rounds last night?
Of course. Why?
Come with me.
What can you tell me about that?
I don't know.
- Paul.
- I see a dead girl turned over on her stomach with her legs spread apart, as though she's been sexually assaulted.
The doctor tells me you're the only one that's been in here.
Cray. You might want to have a look at this.
Martin, what can you tell me about the drops of semen over there?
Someone's trying to frame me.
I'm as confused as you are, but the murder victim's played tricks twice now and you've been involved both times.
- Do you have any enemies?
- Not that I know of.
Debts? Old grudges?
Angry drug dealers? Anything?
Wait a minute. There was someone.
This hooker, Joyce.
I went with her.
I see.
The girl down there was her friend.
She identified the body.
The police must know her.
- Young girl. Redhead, skinny.
- Yeah, right.
I remember interviewing her.
What happened?
First, she called my house one night.
Then she met my girlfriend and said I'd done stuff that I never did.
Why would she do that?
- How did you meet her?
- Through a friend. It was a joke.
Friend? Which friend?
Just some guy, James.
It was supposed to be a joke.
So many things are.
What's your friend's full name?
James Christian Galman.
- Martin.
- Yeah?
If all this is what I think it is... there's someone very dangerous standing right behind you in the dark breathing down your neck.
And maybe you've unwittingly become his link to Joyce.
What do you mean, "his link"?
I think the murderer wants the murder to be exposed.
- I still don't get it.
- Well, I think he wants to stop.
I think he's tired of killing.
Wants to be free.
But he won't be free as long as we're looking for him.
And how long will we continue looking for him?
Till we catch the killer.
So what's the solution to his dilemma?
Get somebody else caught in his place.
He chooses a new victim... and then he makes someone else look guilty when he kills her.
He's already gained Joyce's trust.
Now all he needs to do is find her killer.
Her killer?
No, this is too absurd.
Why does Joyce suddenly call you?
Why does she go see your girlfriend?
Think about what's happened here.
Think about that doctor that looks at you without doubt in his mind.
Even Deputy Inspector Bill suspects you.
No, you can't be serious.
Don't worry, Martin.
I know it's not you.
It has to be someone that knows his way around here.
So, what about the old night watchman?
Yes, I'll look into it.
- What about the semen in the morgue?
- What about it?
Yes, well, the lab is gonna analyse it, but in the meantime, can we have a sample from you?
Martin, it's Joyce.
I need to see you. It's important.
There are some things I need to tell you that I couldn't tell you before.
I need to see you in person, tonight at eight.
Excuse me?
My address is 9248 Second Street, number 322.
Fuck this!
He wasn't at home.
It was the answering machine.
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing with Joyce?
- What?
- The police can't find the murderer.
Someone raped one of the victims.
- Someone threatened Joyce.
- Shit.
- So, they know who it is?
- They have a suspect.
- Who is it?
- The wrong guy, I guess.
I guess they got the wrong guy.
You wanna narrow that down a little bit? Which wrong guy?
- It's me.
- You?
They think it's you?
Oh, boy!
Boy, they got the wrong guy.
I'll ask you this once and then I'll walk away and forget all about it.
OK.
Is it you?
Martin!
Oh, come on. Martin!
It makes me sick when I think of the scum out there.
God gave him over... in the sinful desires of their hearts, to sexual impurity...
Do you know...
Do you know where the Himalayas are?
I have always wanted to go to the Himalayas.
I've always wanted to go there.
I've always wanted to go to the Himalayas.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Martin, it's Joyce.
I need to see you.
It's important.
There are some things I need to tell you that I couldn't tell you before.
I need to see you in person, tonight at eight.
My address is 9248 Second Street, number 322.
Damn, what if you wouldn't have gotten out of there?
Can you imagine what he would...
Katherine, we have to call the police.
We can't let her just lie there.
They found her.
A young girl was found dead tonight, the third in as many weeks.
We have all the evidence we need.
We'll have closure soon.
I'd like to talk to the duty doctor.
One moment.
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello. This is Martin Bells.
You know, the screwed-up kid from Forensics.
- Joyce asked me to say hello.
- Who?
Joyce. Your playmate.
Listen. I have personally asked for your removal. Go home.
Well, I thought you'd want me to stay.
Go and see a psychiatrist.
Do you think I'm a psychopath?
You wouldn't be the first night watchman who was.
The first.
The first.
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies,
I'd like to speak to Martin Bells.
- He's not here.
- We don't know where he is.
- Hello.
- Yeah, hi. It's me.
Joyce has been murdered. The cops are here looking for you right now.
- I'm going over.
- It's too dangerous.
He didn't do it!
Keep your ears open.
I'm gonna try something.
- Martin is not a murderer.
- We don't make up evidence.
He's a suspect because weird things happened at work?
Listen. She exposed him herself.
- She wrote his name.
- What did she write?
- His name.
- Yeah, but what name?
Martin.
We changed the names.
Joyce thought he was James so she would have written James.
- That makes you our prime suspect.
- This is ridiculous.
- There was no name.
- What?
Katherine was there.
You were there? When?
There was a lot of blood.
But there was no name.
And the murderer... was still there.
- What?
- Katherine.
Hello.
Yeah, hello? This is Martin Bells.
The new... new night watchman.
You showed me around here.
You know what time it is?
Inspector Cray, please. Well, where'd he go? The hospital? Alone?
You told me the story about the guy who did it with... you know.
- When was it?
- The guy with the corpses?
- Yeah.
- Before I started, late '60s.
- Do you remember his name?
- No.
- And what happened to him?
- Nothing.
- What?
- The embarrassment.
The hospital couldn't press charges.
No. I guess he's out there somewhere.
Where is she?
Cray.
Hello?
Martin, it's Inspector Cray.
We have a situation here.
Joyce has been murdered.
We have to talk.
Well, I'll come down to the station.
We really have to get to the bottom of this.
I think it might be better if I pick you up.
Martin?
- Are you still there?
- I'd prefer to come to the station.
I'll come and get you.
Tell me, Martin. Are you still gonna maintain your innocence?
Yeah.
Who else could it be, Martin?
The killing has to stop, Martin.
Don't you want it to stop?
Maybe I could talk to Deputy Inspector Bill.
Why wouldn't you want to talk to me?
You're under arrest, Martin.
Would you please put this on your desk?
We have all the time in the world to wait for your confession, Martin.
All the time in the world.
I want you to do me a favour, Martin.
- Hit me.
- What?
Come on, hit me.
How much more can you take?
Do you know what they'll do to you?
They'll snuff you out like a bug hitting a windshield.
You're going to die anyway, Martin.
Don't you know that you're going to die?
Come on, Martin.
You've got to do something.
Protect yourself. Save yourself.
This is your last chance!
Do something... or I'll take your girlfriend's eyes.
Martin?
He's gone mad! Get in the hall!
Get in the hall!
No!
Katherine!
I shouldn't be telling you this, but she wrote his name before she died.
I know.
Deputy Inspector Bill told me.
Deputy Inspector Bill told you?
That's highly unorthodox.
I'm very glad you told me this.
This changes everything.
All right, let's go through this one more time.
Why didn't you call from Joyce's apartment?
Because the murderer was still there.
The murderer was still there?
She was already dead.
- She was already dead?
- She hadn't written anything, so...
- Yes?
- Someone else must have written it.
Trying to frame Martin, right?
Trying to frame Martin? Yes.
Where are we?
Interesting theory.
What do we do now?
Martin, I'm waiting.
Hey, I was worried about you.
- He hit me and escaped.
- Something's wrong.
Nothing's wrong. Who's this?
James.
- Where's Katherine?
- How should I know?
Her bike's outside, she must be in here somewhere.
She's not in here. He, uh...
He probably took her with him.
Martin!
Help!
Help us!
Take him to the station. I'll take a look at Joyce. I'll meet you there.
- Wait, why would they try to escape?
- Take it easy.
Handcuff him.
What?
You're under arrest for suspicion of murder.
This is bullshit.
You have doubts too. Tell him!
Doubts?
Doubts about what,
Deputy Inspector Bill?
Nothing.
I don't like it when you keep things from me, Deputy Inspector Bill.
I've always encouraged you to have your own ideas, haven't I?
- Yeah. It's nothing. He's babbling.
- You said something was wrong.
Well, something is definitely wrong.
Take him away.
Have you ever been killed before?
I'll be back in a minute.
No. No. No.
This just doesn't happen.
It's not happening.
Cray, why are you doing this?
What the hell are you doing?
Stop asking for the how and why,
Martin.
Does it hurt?
Let's grow old together.
Yeah.
Let's get older.
There's a challenge.
James, we're gonna take a little ride now, all right? Keep that up.
Can you walk?
Dick Laurent is dead.
You don't mind that
I'm not coming tonight?
What are you going to do?
Stay home, read.
Read?
Read?
Read what, Renee?
It's nice to know 
I can still make you laugh.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
You can wake me up when you get home if you want to.
What is that?
A videotape.
I found it outside on the steps.
Who's it from?
I don't know.
There isn't anything on the envelope.
Does it say anything on the tape?
No. Nothing.
Well, see what's on it.
Come on.
Must be from a real estate agent.
Maybe.
It's OK.
It's OK.
It's OK.
I had a dream last night.
You were inside the house...
You were calling my name...
Fred!
Fred!
Where are you.
I couldn't find you.
Then there you were...
... Iying in bed.
It wasn't you.
It looked like you, but it wasn't.
Fred, are you all right?
You're up early.
That dog woke me.
Who the hell owns that dog?
What's that?
Another videotape.
Yes.
Don't you want to watch it?
I guess so.
Well, don't you want to watch it?
Yeah.
It's the same thing.
No, it isn't.
Fred?
What?
We have to call the police.
That's right. Yes.
Someone broke in and taped us while we slept. Isn't that enough?
7035 Hollis.
Near the observatory.
Yes.
We'll be here.
So?
They're sending 2 detectives out.
That's it.
What do you think.
I really don't know.
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.
This is the bedroom?
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.
This is our bedroom.
There's no other bedroom?
No.
I mean, I use it as a practice room.
It's soundproof.
You're a musician?
Yeah.
What's your axe?
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.
- Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.
Do you own a video camera?
No.
Fred hates them.
I like to remember things my own way.
What do you mean by that?
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.
You have an alarm system?
Yes. Actually, we do.
But we haven't been using it lately.
Why not?
It kept going off...
For some reason. False alarms.
Might want to try and use it again.
Yeah.
OK?
We're going to check the windows and doors, see if anybody tried to break in.
-We'll keep watch over the house.
-We'll do the best we can.
-If anything else happens, you'll call us.
-We will.
-Thanks, guys.
-It's what we do.
Hey, Andy! Welcome to my party.
-You look ravishing.
-Thank you.
Fred!
Please!
Please!
Hey!
-2 double scotches, neat.
-OK.
We've met before, haven't we?
I don't think so.
Where was it you think we met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No. No, I don't.
Are you sure?
Of course.
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
At your house.
That's fucking crazy, man!
Call me!
Dial your number!
Go ahead!
I told you I was here.
How'd you do that?
Ask me!
How'd you get inside my house?
You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted.
Who are you?
Hm.
Give me back my phone.
It's been a pleasure talking to you.
-I thought you were getting me a drink.
-Hang on just a minute.
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.
Dick Laurent?
Yeah. I believe so.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
He is?
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?
I don't.
I don't know him.
Dick can't be dead.
Who told you he was dead?
Who, honey?
Who's dead?
Let's go home.
-But...
-Now. We're leaving now.
We never should have come here in the first place.
So, how'd you meet that asshole Andy anyway?
It was a long time ago.
We met at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.
He told me about a job.
What job?
I don't remember.
Anyway...Andy's OK.
Well, He's got some pretty fucked-up friends.
Hey!..
Hey!..
Stay in the car.
I told you to stay in the car.
Why? What is it?
Why did you make me stay out here?
I'll tell you why, because I thought someone was inside the house.
Was there?
No, of course not.
Fred?
Fred, where are you?
Renee!
Renee!
Sit down, Killer!
I didn't kill her.
Tell me I didn't kill her.
We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that you be put to death in the electric chair.
Make yourself to home, fella.
Stick your hand out, chief.
Something wrong?
It's...my head.
You sleeping OK?
No.
I can't sleep.
You'll sleep now.
Take him back to his cell.
Let's go.
Guard!
Guard!
Guard!
Hey!
What do you want?
Aspirin.
My head.
Hey! Hey!
Shit. That wife killer's looking pretty fucked up.
Which one?
Pete!
Please don't go!
No. Pete!
Pete!..Pete!..Pete!
Wait a minute!
Fuck me!
All right. What's the situation?
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.
Right here.
That's not Fred Madison.
No, Sir. It's not.
-Who is it?
-I couldn't say, Sir.
Captain Luneau?
Yeah, Mike?
Captain...
This is some spooky shit we got here.
Well, Gentlemen, we know who the stranger is.
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft for which he was put on probation for 1 year.
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.
So...
-Here.
-Thanks, Lou.
Where the fuck have you been, man?
-Hey! -Hiya. -Hi.
-Hey, guy.
-Hey, man.
-What's up man?
Well, you look like shit.
Yeah. What happened?
Just haven't been feeling so good.
You're not contagious, are you?
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.
But it's worth it when you know that...
-Come on.
-Hoh.
Come on. I'll lead.
...and a glass of fresh, cold milk from grandmother's cow.
See ya later.
-I'm gonna go out with these clowns for a while.
-That should do you some good.
-Good night. -See ya.
-Good night.
What's happening to you?
What happened to your face?
-I don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?
You've been acting strange lately.
Like the other night.
What night?
The last time I saw you.
I don't remember.
You still care about me?
Pete!
-Arnie!
-Where you been?
-How you doing?
-It's good you're back...
...Wonderful.
-Good to see you, man.
Listen, man, a lot of people...
...gonna be real happy that you're back, including me.
Well, it's good to be back.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.
Yeah, I'll take care of him.
And Mr. Eddy called.
-Can I call him and tell him to come in?
-Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.
-And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
-You're ready to work?
-Yeah.
-Well, let's go to work.
-All right, Buddy.
Petey's back!
There's 9 People down here.
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...
...I'll let you ask the other 2.
Hey, Pete!
Pete!
Where's Pete?
He's back there!
Mr. Eddy!
Hey!
What happened?
-Somebody giving you trouble?
-No. No trouble.
'Cause if somebody's giving you trouble, Pete,...
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that!
-No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
-I mean it, Pete. Like...that!
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...
...just a regular tune-up?
-I want you to take a ride with me.
I don't like the sound of something.
-OK. I got to check in with the boss.
-It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.
Pull it over, but keep it running.
Best goddamn ears in town.
Give that a try.
Beautiful...Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.
-Let's take a ride.
-Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
It's a beautiful day.
-You did a great job, Pete.
-Yeah.
Well, you know I like working on this car, Mr. Eddy.
Shit. That cocksucker doing what I think he's doing?
This is where mechanical excellence...
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.
Ahh...Oh, oh, God!
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!
-Ever!
-Tell him you won't tailgate.
Ever!
-I won't ever...
-Do you know how many fucking car lengths it takes...
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?!
6 fucking car lengths!
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister!
If I had to stop suddenly, you would've hit me!
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual!
I want you to study that motherfucker!
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules!
50 fucking thousand people were killed on the highway last
Because of fucking assholes like you!
-Tell me you're going to get a manual!
-I will ge-get a manual.
Fucking ldiot!
Oh!.Aah!.Oh, Gooood!
I'm sorry about that, Pete.
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.
Yeah, I can see that.
Wait a minute!
-Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
-No, thank you.
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.
You like pornos?
-Pornos?
-Give you a boner?
Uh, No, No thanks. No.
Suit yourself, champ.
-Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
-You will.
Damn!
Lou, you recognize that guy?
Yeah...Laurent.
-What do you want?
-Want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
Get in, Baby!
Come here!
-Why don't you like me?
-I do like you.
How much?
Oh, Pete!
Sheila!
Sheila!
What'd you change it for?
I like that.
Well, I don't.
I like that!
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.
-Think you'll get a chance to give her the once-over today?
-Sure.
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.
-It'll be done.
-You're my man, Pete.
Don't let that thing upset you.
Holy smokes!
Hey!
I'm Alice Wakefield.
Pete Dayton.
-I was here earlier.
-Yeah, I remember.
How'd you like to take me to dinner?
I don't know.
OK.
Why don't I take you to dinner?
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.
Do you have a phone?
Yeah.
It's right...lt's right there.
I have to call myself another taxi.
Hello? Van Nuys?
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...
Hello. Yeah, we're not going to need that cab.
Thanks.
Maybe we should just skip dinner.
Take my clothes off!
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.
-I want more.
-Me, too.
-Can I call you?
-Yeah. Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
OK, Baby.
Hey! Up here.Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Meow, meow.It's me.
Hey, Baby.
I can't see you tonight.
OK.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sure.
I think he suspects something. We have to be careful.
I miss you.
Pete?
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
What a fucking job.
His or ours, Lou?
Ours, Hank.
-Hey.
-Sit down a minute!
-What's up?
-Sit down!
You don't look so good.
No, I just...just have a headache.
What's going on?
The police called us.
What'd they want?
They want to know if we had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night.
And they want to know if you remembered anything.
But I don't remember anything.
What'd you tell them?
We're not going to say anything...
...about that night to the police.
We saw you that night, Pete.
You came home with your friend Sheila.
Sheila?
Yeah. There was a man with you.
What is this? I mean, why didn't you tell me anything?
Who's the man?
I've never seen him before in my life.
What happened to me?
Please, please, Dad, Tell me!
Hey, Pete! Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Mr. Eddy.
Hey, Pete!
-How you doing?
-I'm OK.
I'm sure you noticed that girl who was with me the other day.
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.
Her name is Alice.I swear,
I love that girl to death.
If I ever found out somebody was making out with her...
I'd take this and I'd shove it so far up his ass, it would come out his mouth.
-And then you know what I'd do?
-What?
I'd blow his fucking brains out.
Hey. You're looking good.
What you been up to?
I'll get it.
Hello?
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel on Sycamore in 20 minutes.
He'll kill us.
Are you...
...positive that he knows?
I'm not positive, but he knows.
So...What are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
If we could just get some money, we could go away together.
I know a guy.
He pays girls to party with him.
He's always got a lot of cash.
He'd be easy to rob.
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.
We could be together.
Have you partied with him?
Did you like it?
No.
It was part of the deal.
What deal?
-He works for Mr. Eddy.
-Yeah?
-And what's he do?
-He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
-Pornos?
-Yeah.
How did you get in with these fucking people, Alice?
-Pete...
-No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.
It was a long time ago.
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.
He told me about a job.
In pornos?
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.
He made an appointment for me to see a man.
I went to this place.
They made me wait there forever.
There was a guy guarding the door.
In another room, there was this other guy lifting weights.
I started getting nervous.
When it got dark...
...they brought me into this other room.
Why didn't you just leave?
You liked it, huh?
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.
I don't want you to go away.
I don't want you to go away.
I love you, Alice.
-Should I call Andy?
-Andy?
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.
Yeah. Call him.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.
You meet me at his place at 11:00.
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.
It's a white Stucco job on the south side of the street.
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.
At 11:15, I'll send Andy down to fix me a drink.
And when he does, you crack him on the head, OK?
OK.
-You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
-Sheila!
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila! Sheila, stop it!
-You don't call. Who is she?
-Stop it!
-What's the bitch's name?
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?
-Go home!
-You're sorry?
-Sheila, stop it!
You're sorry, you piece of shit!
-You're sorry?
-Go home!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila, stop, Sheila!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila...Sheila.
Sheila! Let's both go in and talk about this quietly.
Sheila, come on.
-You are different.
-Sheila!
Tell him!..Tell him!
Sheila, don't. Don't.
I don't care anymore anyway. I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.
I won't bother you, or any member of your family ever again.
Pete?
There's a man on the phone.
He's called a couple of times tonight.
Who is it?
He won't give his name.
Hello?
Hey, Pete, how you doing?
-Who is this?
-You know who it is.
Mr. Eddy?
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?
-OK.
-You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.
-Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
-I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.
-You're sure you're OK? Everything all right?
-Yeah.
I'm really glad to know you're doing good, Pete. Hey!
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
We've met before, haven't we?
I don't think so.
Where is it you think we've met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
No. No, I don't.
In the East, the far East...
...when a person is sentenced to death, they're sent to a place where they can't escape.
Never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head.
What's going on?
It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.
You got him.
Alice!
Wow!
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
Alice?
What do we do?
What do we do?
We have to get the stuff.
We have to get out of here.
Ah, fuck!
Is that you?
Are both of them you?
That's me.
Honey, are you all right?
Where's the bathroom?
It's upstairs, down the hall.
Did you want to talk to me?
Did you want to ask me, why?
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me, Pete?
Stick this in your pants.
I know a fence.
He'll give us money, get us passports in exchange for all this shit and Andy's car...
And then we can go anywhere.
Come on, Baby!
Pete, you drive!
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?
Where the fuck are we going?
We have to go to the desert, Baby.
The fence I told you about...
He's at his cabin.
Come on!
We'll have to wait.
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?
You still want me, don't you, Pete?
More than ever.
I want you.
I want you.
I want you.
I want you.
You'll never have me.
Here I am.
-Where's Alice?
-Alice who? Her name is Renee.
If she told you her name is Alice, she's lying.
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?!
Renee?
You're coming with me.
What do you guys want?
Now you can hand it back!
You and me, Mister...
We can really outugly them sumbitches...
Can't we?
Ed...Take a look at this!
Yeah. That's her all right.
That's Fred Madison's wife with Dick Laurent.
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.
We got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You know what I think, Ed?
What is it, AI? What do you think?
I think there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Dick Laurent is dead.
Hello, admitting.
This is Saperstein.
Where is he?
He's cleared admitting?
Right. Bring him in.
He's coming.
Good, good.
Trent?
John J.
Put him in number nine.
You son of a bitch!
Hang on to him.
Get him in there!
No, not me!
No, wait, wait!
This is wrong.
Look, I'm sorry about the balls!
It was a lucky shot, that's all!
Wait!
I'm not insane.
You hear me?
I'm not insane!
I'm not if he's not!
Me neither!
I'm not insane!
We've only just begun
Not the Carpenters, too.
So let me go
This is a rotten way to end it.
This is not the ending.
You haven't read it yet.
All right.
Came in this afternoon?
Yes. How did you get here so fast?
We've been monitoring all admissions... through police and paramedic channels.
This one fit the symptoms.
Do you think he's one of them?
Mr. Saperstein, I promise you... that's what I'm here to find out.
Things must be getting pretty bad out there... to bring you fellas in.
Is this it?
Did he make any requests?
Just... one.
A, uh... single black crayon.
Hang on.
What's up?
My name is Dr. Wrenn... and I am going to try and get you out of here.
After all my redecorating?
No. I think I'll stay.
There's a guard with a pair of swollen testicles... who swears you wanted out of here.
I, uh, well...
I've changed my mind.
I see.
The crosses are a nice touch.
They'd almost have to keep you in here... once they'd seen these, wouldn't they, John?
Got a smoke?
You're waiting to hear about my "them," aren't you?
Your what?
My "them. "
Every paranoid schizophrenic has one...
a "them," a "they," an "it. "
And you want to hear about my "them," don't you?
I want to know how you got here.
Things are turning to shit out there, aren't they?
Let's talk about you.
Your dime.
I'm, uh...
I was an insurance investigator, freelance.
Checked out funny claims, frauds... the usual kind of thing.
And lately I'd been working for a firm here in the city.
And all of this started with the disappearance.
The Sutter Cane... disappearance.
It's a little hot in here, isn't it?
It's boiling.
How long I gotta be here?
I mean, uh...
I took care of all that paperwork.
The check was supposed to be here three weeks ago.
Right? Isn't that right?
Well, usually, yeah, that's the way it goes... but I just have a few final questions about the fire.
More questions.
I've answered all your questions.
Enough's enough.
It was supposed to be cut and dried.
We'll be out of here in a minute.
See, Robby here, he owns the company.
And he's hired me to see that things go smoothly, understand?
It's just a little thing, but, see...
Robby takes the view that it was you... who burned down your own warehouse on Northern Boulevard.
Me? That's horseshit.
That was all my own stuff in that warehouse.
That's my whole life.
Believe me, I sympathize.
You're really starting to sweat.
Shall I turn on the air conditioning?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
I'm running a little late.
Supposed to pick up my wife.
Oh, yeah, your wife.
She's a great lady.
You know her?
No, not really.
We just met briefly.
You know, when I went round to check up on your story.
We have these photographs... of your wife tooling around town... wearing various articles... that you claim were destroyed in the fire.
No, that's impossible.
No, this is all stuff
I bought for her myself.
See, the problem is... when I went round to talk to her... it turned out she knew much more than she thought she did.
Especially...
Especially after I showed her pictures of Miss Palminteri... who appears to be wearing... even more of your destroyed articles.
Miss Palminteri?
Miss Rosa Palminteri.
A word of advice.
You want to pull a scam, don't make your wife a partner.
If you do... don't fuck around behind her back.
Trent, beautiful.
Everybody says you got the best nose for a con in the business.
But to see it firsthand, I mean, to watch you work... is incredible.
Well, it wasn't hard, Robby.
The guy's wife liked me.
Besides, he was an amateur.
It's too easy with amateurs.
You try to figure out who's professional and who isn't.
That's when it gets fun, when you run into a pro.
You know, most of my salesmen... couldn't sniff out a phony claim... if their noses were nailed to it, but you... man, you never miss.
What's to miss?
You learn to expect the worst in people, and you get it.
Everyone's looking to play an angle.
I'm always there to clean up the mess.
I'll tell you what.
You stop freelancing, join my staff.
I'll make it worth your while.
Forget it, Robby.
I'm my own man.
Nobody pulls my strings.
I'm independent, I'm happy.
Well, be my man one more time.
I'm having quite a difficult mess with Arcane.
The publishing house?
Yeah, my biggest account.
They just filed a claim that cost me millions.
I want you on this right away.
What's the claim?
Sutter Cane is missing.
Who?
Sutter Cane.
Do you read Sutter Cane?
What?
Horror writer Sutter Cane... a harmless pop phenomenon... or a deadly mad prophet of the printed page?
This was the scene today outside several city bookstores.
Police believe the riots began... because the stores could not meet the demand... for advance orders of Sutter Cane's latest novel...
"In the Mouth of Madness. "
When does fiction become religion?
And are his fans dangerous?
Only if you count axes.
In related news, there were eighteen other stores...
Mr. Harglow will see you now.
Thank you.
You're not listening to me.
I needed it yesterday.
If you wait any longer, it'll be all over the front page.
Get it done!
Jackson Harglow, Mr. Trent.
I'm pleased to meet you.
It's a pleasure.
Excuse the commotion.
We have something of a crisis going on.
Everybody out now, please.
I need time with Mr. Trent.
Have Sylvia hold the calls, and you get Linda in here.
That was great.
I almost left myself.
Sit down, please.
I am a little short on patience these days.
So, Mr. Trent, are you familiar with Arcane?
Well, aside from the fact... that you're insured by the company I work for...
I never heard of Arcane.
I'm sorry.
You read books?
Linda Styles, John Trent.
Linda reads books for a living.
She's one of our best editors.
Since she joined the firm... she's been handling
Sutter Cane exclusively.
Isn't he the guy that writes that horror crap?
Maybe he's too sophisticated for you.
Sutter Cane happens to be... this century's most widely read author.
You can forget about Stephen King.
Cane outsells them all.
So what happened to this cash cow of yours?
Cane disappeared two months ago without a trace.
The police have turned up nothing.
Who was the last person to hear from him?
His agent.
Cane mailed him several chapters... of his new book, oh, not two weeks ago.
Plain brown wrapper.
No return address.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
You don't mind, do you?
What'd the agent have to say?
You heard what he had to say.
What are you talking about?
I understand you were there... when the poor man went crazy in midtown Manhattan.
You witnessed the shooting,
I believe.
That lunatic with the ax?
That was Cane's agent?
Hard to believe, isn't it?
Yeah, well, you'd think a guy that outsells Stephen King... could find better representation.
Excuse me.
It's just a little joke.
Well, we're not in the mood.
I'll see you out, Mr. Trent.
Thank you.
Cane is a billion-dollar franchise.
He's the tent pole to this company.
We've already sold the film rights to his new book... as well as publication rights in eighteen languages...
The book you can't find?
Well, his agent found it, at least part of it.
You think he took one look at this latest work of art... and went ax-happy in broad daylight?
I think it's great.
It's great promotion for Arcane, great publicity.
This was not a publicity stunt.
You were there.
Cane's writing has been known to have an effect... on his less stable readers.
An effect? Like what?
Well, disorientation, memory loss... severe paranoid reaction.
People pay money to feel like that? It's cute.
Put it in the press kit.
We need you.
OK. Well, why don't you and I get together after work?
We'll go through his files.
I don't think so.
I need to see his contracts, papers, you know.
Impossible.
His agent was a total buffer.
We don't even know where Cane lives.
What do you know?
For about a year before he disappeared... his work became erratic, bent, more bizarre than usual.
He became convinced his writing was real, not fiction.
Then the work stopped coming.
I need to know if he's alive or dead.
And I need that book.
We've delayed publication as long as we can.
His fans are getting really restless.
This shit really sells, doesn't it?
More than you'd imagine.
Surprised?
Lady, nothing surprises me.
We fucked up the air, the water, we fucked up each other.
Why don't we finish the job... by just flushing our brains down the toilet?
Why don't you try reading his stuff?
See if you can get it.
Got any on tape?
You want some, too, buddy?
No, relax, Robby.
Look, it's a scam, of course it's a scam.
You see... all this strange behaviorfrom people that read the books... and the agent going nuts and so on...
Ifigure it's like mass hysteria, you know?
It's like, um, it's a pop phenomenon.
It's a craze. It'll pass.
It's this year's Hula-Hoop.
Something like that.
Yeah, my God, it's freaky.
No, it's a setup.
I just have to work out how it's set up.
It's just a matter of time.
You, too?
God, I've had heartburn, tell me about it.
Sporadic riots continue to hit Eastern cities... and reports of violence from Boston and Philadelphia... are now coming in.
Police continue to describe barely coherent witnesses... all reporting having read... horror novelist
Sutter Cane's latest novel...
'Hobb's End Horror. "
Many officers have been physically attacked... and more than three hundred eighty people... male and female, have been jailed in New York County.
Two officers in Boston were hacked to death... amid jeering crowds in an attack last night.
What is this horrible, unexplainable madness... that is gripping our lives?
What in the world is happening?
I can see.
Now we have an editorial...
Excuse me?
He sees you.
Great. Uh...
Tell him I say hi.
Oh, hi, Robby. Yeah.
Yeah, not a lot.
I picked up some of these Sutter Cane books.
I've been reading them.
Well, it...
Pulp horror novels.
They're all pretty familiar.
They all seem to have the same plot.
Slimy things in the dark, people go mad... they turn into monsters.
The funny thing is that they're kind of better written... than you'd expect.
They sort of get to you in a way.
I don't know if it's his style of writing... or his use of description or whatever, but...
No, don't be silly.
Do you want some, too, buddy?
He sees you.
What?
Aw, it's just too weird.
Beautiful.
Where'd you go?
Assuming you went somewhere.
Cute.
Now I know why Cane had the artwork done himself.
See this?
It's a map.
The red dot is Hobb's End.
It's not on any real map, but look at this.
The two line up.
Like it or not...
Cane's book covers place Hobb's End... right in the middle of New England.
So you're saying the man went someplace fictional?
It's a real place in a real state.
New Hampshire, to be precise.
But it's not on the map.
Well, not on any new ones, but maybe on some old ones.
There's plenty of forgotten towns across America.
Makes a great contest, doesn't it?
Put the pieces together, find the town... win a Sutter Cane lunchbox.
How can you be sure he's there?
Well, I'd have to go to be sure.
You sure you want me to go?
I'm not suggesting that you're lying... that you're about to file a fraudulent claim... but forgive me if this sounds... a little bit like bullshit to me.
And if you're telling the truth... if you really want your author back... if you really want your book... then maybe it's in both our best interests... if I go find him.
We have nothing to hide,
Mr. Trent.
I desire only ourfair share if Cane is dead... or our property if he's alive.
Since I assume you also have nothing to hide...
I'm sure you won't mind if I send Miss Styles along... on your expedition.
Well, it's your party.
America, the
Beautiful
From sea to
Shining
Who is it? What?
You're awake.
Couldn't you just shake me, you asshole?
What did I do?
We're lost.
We are lost because there is no such place as Hobb's End.
Well, we'll see.
Never, never, never... throw chips at a driver.
God damn it. Shit.
Asshole.
Styles, can I ask you something?
Do you really like working on Cane's stuff?
Do you really like busting people?
Yeah. I bust frauds,
I bust phonies... and, yeah, I love it.
Have you ever busted anyone you know?
Yeah, sure I did.
Didn't make any difference.
You see, in my business, you soon find out... that anybody's capable of anything.
If you can think of it, they've done it.
Doesn't leave you much to believe in.
Yeah.
But think of the upside... it doesn't leave you much to be disappointed in, either.
Believe me, the sooner we're off the planet, the better.
Now you sound like Cane.
No, not me.
You're the Cane lover.
I just like being scared.
Cane's work scares me.
What's to be scared about?
It's not like it's real or anything.
It's not real from your point of view... and right now reality shares your point of view.
What scares me about Cane's work... is what might happen if reality shared his point of view.
Whoa. We're not talking about reality here.
We're talking about fiction.
It's different, you know.
A reality is just what we tell each other it is.
Sane and insane could easily switch places... if the insane were to become the majority.
You would find yourself locked in a padded cell... wondering what happened to the world.
No, that wouldn't happen to me.
It would if you realized... everything you ever knew was gone.
It'd be pretty lonely being the last one left.
Not only in Manhattan proper... but there was that incident in Long Island... that was also related to it.
Come on, I don't buy this.
I mean, what are you saying?
That there's some kind of disease... that's spreading across the country?
It is an addiction that people have at this time... fantasy-creating out of the written material.
How could it be addicting?
Look, I mean this is words.
Or just something that is created by the press?
No. I think it's acting stupid is what it is.
Jesus Christ.
I saw a...
A cow, a sheep, a pig?
What'd you see?
Never mind.
It was nothing.
Good.
Don't move him!
Is he alive?
I don't know.
Just don't move.
He'll get a blanket, so lie still.
I can't get out.
Don't move.
They won't let me out.
He was OK?
Come on, let's go.
We'll tell the cops when we hit the next town.
You OK?
Oh, I can't believe it.
I must have slept through the whole night.
Hey, thanks for driving.
What is it?
Look.
Styles, you're fantastic.
You found it.
What's wrong?
You drive.
Cute, cute, cute.
Main Street, USA.
Jesus.
Antiques.
Look at this old crap.
I wonder where they manufacture this shit.
Look.
Those kids.
You didn't see them?
Where is everyone?
It's like the place is picture perfect... and there's nobody around.
Come on.
Styles, how'd you know about this place?
I thought you'd never been here before.
I haven't.
I've read about it.
So have you.
This is empty now.
It used to be filled with strange growing things... remember?
One night, the townspeople saw something moving in here... something enormous, with arms like snakes.
'Hobb's End Horror. "
The hotelfrom...
'Hobb's End Horror. "
Styles, you know what I'm thinking?
There's gotta be a great tie-in for a town like this.
I mean, think of the tourist potential, for instance, or...
There should be a painting behind us.
It's nice.
There's a loose board there.
Good morning.
Can I help you folks?
I certainly hope so.
We'd like a room, please.
We're on our way to Boston.
We thought we'd take a... break in yourfamous little town.
Famous?
Yeah, what with the whole
Sutter Cane thing and all.
Sut-Sutter who?
Cane. We heard he came from around here... and comes back to stay once in a while.
Uh, I don't know anybody named Cane.
Ha. Nobody passes through here much anymore.
Let me get you your keys.
You want me to leave a deposit or my credit card or something?
Oh, city folk.
Miss Styles, if that's what you saw, then... yeah, I guess it would be a little... unsettling.
I'd be a little unnerved myself.
But regardless of what you saw, regardless of what you think... we are not living inside a Sutter Cane story.
They're all in here.
The Mrs. Pickman in the book is a lunatic... who chops her husband into coleslaw.
That sweet old thing that we met downstairs... isn't capable of anything worse than... dipping her dentures into her husband's beer.
Trent, I know you think this is a joke.
Just listen to me for a second, please.
What if Cane's work isn't fiction?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
This is reality.
You hear that?
Reality.
Now, if what you're saying is true... there should be out that window... a black Byzantine church with two-hundred-fifty-foot spires... with gold onions on the top.
Now, look.
You see?
Reality.
You didn't read closely enough.
The view is from the east.
"This place had once been the seat of an evil...
"older than mankind...
"and wider than the known universe.
"It was a place of pain and suffering...
"beyond human understanding. "
You got me reading this thing like it's a guidebook.
"Originally, there was an old stone church...
"built on this site in seventeen eighty-eight...
"but the black church...
"swallowed up the old sanctuary...
"the way it has swallowed our minds.
"Now there is nothing left of what was once here...
"except the mosaic of our Lord and Savior...
"above the front door. "
"Some believe the old sanctuary still exists somewhere...
"trapped inside this evil edifice.
"It's primeval inhabitants...
"were a murderous race of creatures...
"whose vile existence contaminated time itself...
"affecting history...
"with their sadistic wickedness. "
It's the battle for heaven.
The archangel Michael's fighting off...
Don't tell me. "Fighting off one of the creatures...
"from the other side," right?
A representation. The things
Cane writes are indescribable.
"Beyond description. "
Right.
We're wasting our time.
We ought to be asking about Cane.
We'll have somebody to ask in about two seconds.
Come on, we have to get out of here.
We can't be in front of the church, Trent.
They have guns, Trent.
No, I want to go back.
Give him back!
Johnny!
Johnny-boy!
Is that Cane?
Get in the truck!
Where are they comingfrom?
I see.
Tell me how you knew about that mob!
You see, you can't bullshit a bullshitter, can you?
'Cause I'll tell you how.
This whole thing has been staged, that's how.
You, Harglow, and Cane put me through all of this... so I can blab to the media... about Cane's haunted little town... help you sell a few more million copies.
Well, fuck that.
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.
Before I leave this shitty town...
I'm going to find someone who's going to come clean... and we're going to dismiss your bullshit claim.
You're wrong, Trent.
I know you are wrong.
How am I wrong?
Because you're right.
You're half right.
This was a hoax.
We did send Cane away on a publicity stunt... only he never showed up.
Harglow sent me with you to make it look good... only we weren't supposed to find anything, but we did.
That's how I know what we're seeing is real.
We didn't stage any of this.
It's all happening for real, Trent.
And it is all in that book, and that's how I know.
You're lying.
I read the books, too, you remember?
There's nothing about any mob, any little girl.
Not in the old books, Trent.
In the new one!
No one knew what was in it except me and Cane's agent.
All right.
What's it about, the new one?
It's about the end to everything... and it starts here in this place... with an evil that returns and takes over Hobb's End... piece by piece, starting with the children.
It's about people turning into things... creatures that aren't human anymore.
It's fiction, Styles, fiction.
We need to read the new book to find the way out.
How's that gonna help?
We could skip to the ending.
I really hope you're making this up... because if you're not, you're actually crazy.
Please, Trent.
Don't make me do this alone,
Trent.
Are you coming with me?
Fine.
Have a nice bus ride home.
No smoking, please.
It bothers my husband.
I'm sorry.
I just can't seem to help myself around here.
I was just on my way out.
I thought I'd stop and admire the artwork.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Sure is.
Styles told me you painted it yourself.
You mean the pretty young thing you came in here with?
I don't know her at all.
Does she know me?
She claims she does.
So you're not responsible for this?
Hell, no.
Well, it's a nice place you got here.
It must be a hell of a thing to keep clean.
You look as if you've been up all night.
Been reading.
Hush!
You're a writer?
You an actor?
Take a hint, leave.
This ain't no tourist town.
Oh, I've been trying to.
You guys are good, you know.
You, the old lady at the hotel...
Really, really good.
Cane's been messing with the church.
Now something came leaking out, took the little ones first... then passed it on to us.
Can I buy you a beer?
Don't let it get to you.
Just get out.
Give it.
What are you?
Where do you come from?
Where do you live?
With you.
Who takes care of you?
You do.
You're my mommy.
Know what today is?
Today is Mommy's Day.
Nice to see you again.
You can edit this one from the inside, looking out.
It's funny, isn't it?
For years, I thought
I was making all this up.
But they were telling me what to write... giving me the power to make it all real.
And now it is.
All those horrible, slimy things... trying to get back in?
They're all true.
Come.
See the instrument of their homecoming.
What you have come lookingfor.
The new Bible... that starts the change... helps you see.
Do you like my ending?
Any suggestions?
You found something.
Where the hell did you go?
I'm losing me, John.
Help me.
I'm losing me.
What's happening?
I saw the book.
Don't look at it.
Don't read it, John.
I'm losing me!
Mrs. Pickman!
Come on, you old bitch.
We're going. Now.
You are a dead girl
Fuck you!
You're still here.
Busy night.
Special effects, hidden speakers.
You people are professionals,
I'll give you that.
The thing I can't remember is what came first... us or the book.
We are not living in a Sutter Cane story!
This is not reality!
Reality is not what it used to be.
Oh, Jesus, this place makes my head hurt.
Oh, really?
Come on, look at this.
This was done by a five-year-old... my five-year-old.
Johnny's sister.
She did me after she did her mom.
You're alone.
Shit. Don't.
I have to.
He wrote me this way.
Oh, shit.
The key.
Jesus!
Christ.
Shit.
Never leave the city.
Why don't I learn?
Are we leaving?
We're already home.
You should have believed me.
Where's the fucking highway?
Cane's writing me.
He wants me to kiss you.
Why?
Because it's good for the book.
Jesus!
It's what the readers want to read.
Oh, God!
Go! Get... get away from me!
Cane has a job for you.
Afew bad calls.
Afew wrong turns.
Do you want to know the problem with places like this?
With religion in general?
It's never known how to convey the anatomy of horror.
Religion seeks discipline through fear... yet doesn't understand the true nature of creation.
No one's ever believed it enough to make it real.
The same cannot be said of my world.
Your books aren't real.
But they've sold over a billion copies.
I've been translated into eighteen languages.
More people believe in my work than believe in the Bible.
You got a point?
I think you know it.
There has to be some kind of an explanation... for what I've seen tonight.
I'll sort this shit out later, but right now... there has to be some kind of a simple fucking explanation.
Always lookingfor the con.
Even now you're trying to rationalize.
Anyway... your books suck.
You must try reading my new one.
The others have had quite an effect... but this one will drive you absolutely mad.
So I'm told.
It'll make the world ready for the change.
It takes its power... from new readers and new believers.
That's the point.
Belief!
When people begin to lose their ability... to know the difference between fantasy and reality... the old ones can begin their journey back.
The more people who believe, the faster the journey.
And with the way the other books have sold... this one is bound to be very, very popular.
Want to see?
All done.
"In the Mouth of Madness. "
Yours to deliver, Trent.
What?
I will be joining my new publishers now.
You take the manuscript back to the world for me... that's what you do.
What I do?
You are what I write.
Like this town.
It wasn't here before I wrote it.
And neither were you.
I know what's real.
I know what I am... and nobody pulls my strings.
Did you think my agent attacked you by accident?
He read about you... in there.
He knew you'd bring it back and start the change... make what's happened here happen everywhere.
He tried to stop you.
I'm not a piece of fiction.
I think, therefore you are.
Read it if you don't believe me.
See what I have in store for you.
I know what I am.
Go back.
Your world lies beyond that passage.
Go now.
I can't hold them back any longer.
"Trent stood at the edge of the rip...
"stared into the illimitable gulf of the unknown...
"the Stygian world yawning blackly beyond.
"Trent's eyes refused to close.
"He did not shriek...
"but the hideous unholy abominations...
"shrieked for him...
"as in the same second he saw them...
"spill and tumble upward...
"out of an enormous carrion black pit...
"choked with the gleaming white bones...
"of countless unhallowed centuries.
"He began to back away from the rip...
"as the army of unspeakable figures...
"twilit by the glow from the bottomless pit...
"came pouring at him toward our world. "
Come with me.
I can't.
I've read to the end.
Hey, kid.
You want a paper?
Have you been in an accident?
You want me to get somebody?
No. Just...
Just point me to the highway.
Straight up.
Hey, kid.
Did you ever hear of Hobb's End?
What?
Package for you, sir.
But nobody knows I'm here.
Well, someone does.
Who delivered this?
I don't know.
Who?!
I don't know!
I wasn't here last night.
Who was it?!
I was.
And I didn't see shit.
I remember New York during the Depression.
They think they have it bad now.
You should have seen the Bowery back then.
Bodies piled two, three feet high off the gutter.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm God now.
You understand?
God's not supposed to be a hack horror writer.
But maybe
I can help you believe.
Look around when you wake up.
Did I ever tell you my favorite color was blue?
Relax, buddy.
Relax.
You're awake now.
It was just a bad dream.
Are you deaf and dumb, sir?
I was just there in the town... in that town, and... there were people there... and shops and homes and...
I don't doubt that.
What I'm telling you for the tenth time... is that it couldn't have been called Hobb's End.
There never was, is, or shall be any such place... by that name in this state.
Ever.
I want to see your supervisor!
Well... that is quite a story.
If you could write it,
I'd publish it.
You don't believe it, do you?
If I don't, what's my option?
That I'm crazy?
I'm not crazy.
Have you heard the rumors... that Cane's books have affected certain readers?
Yeah. Styles told me.
Styles... Oh, that's the girl you say I sent with you.
But I know I sent you off alone.
Why wouldn't I remember her?
Well...
That's easy.
She was written out.
Written out?
Look, do you think... those books somehow infected you?
Listen to me, Harglow.
Everything I've said is true.
It's real.
And that's why I had to destroy the last manuscript.
But I know that's not true.
What are you talking about?
You delivered that manuscript to me months ago.
To me personally in this room.
I did?
Yes, you did.
Last spring.
For God's sakes, we published in July.
The book's been in the stores for seven weeks.
Have you read it?
No.
I never read Cane's work.
I haven't got the stomach for it.
Pull it.
Don't distribute it.
Even if everything I've said is totally Looney Tunes...
I know this book will drive people crazy.
Well, let's hope so.
The movie comes out next month.
Oh, Christ.
The newest, and presumably posthumous, work... of Sutter Cane continues to sit at number one... on the best-seller list.
'In the Mouth of Madness" is expected to break... all previous publishing records.
On the local scene, police are at a loss to explain... the outbreak of violent crime among the city's clergy.
The mayor has called an emergency meeting... of law enforcement and medical agencies... to discuss an apparent epidemic of paranoid schizophrenia.
Just an unbelievably horrible story, Bob.
What began locally... has now broken out into a global epidemic.
An epidemic of monumental proportions... of senseless, seemingly unmotivated acts of violence.
Like the book?
I love it.
Good.
Then this shouldn't come as a surprise.
Jeez!
I don't believe he did that!
It's spreading out there, isn't it?
Just because you know the symptoms... doesn't mean to say your story's true.
It's Cane's story... and it'll spread with each new reader.
That's how it gets its power.
What about the people who don't read?
There's a movie.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm gonna leave now... but I'll be coming back,
I promise.
I want to help you.
There's no hurry.
It's safer in here now.
It'll get worse out there.
Why?
Every species can smell its own extinction.
The last ones left... won't have a pretty time of it.
And in ten years, maybe less... the human race will just be a bedtime story... for their children.
A myth. Nothing more.
Did he have anything to say?
No. It was useless.
He thinks he's fiction... and that Sutter Cane's causing the epidemic.
Do you read Sutter Cane?
Oh, God!
I'll try and continue... this emergency broadcast as long as we can hold out here.
Um, the city is almost completely deserted now.
There are only a few stragglers left on the streets.
There are no emergency services.
The fires continue to burn out of control.
This incredible epidemic of random mass killing... has spread to every country in the civilized world.
Every hour, more people are becoming infected... being driven to senseless acts of extreme violence.
We have gotten reports, sketchy at best... of people mutating, their bodies swelling and distorting... changing somehow.
Locally, the mass killings appear to have moved inland.
All the major cities on the East Coast are silent.
We lost contact with Los Angeles... and the West Coast last night... so it's impossible at this time to know... how many unaffected people are left.
If for any reason... you are one of us who hasn't become infected... take shelter immediately.
Do not trust any friends or family members.
I repeat... Do not...
I'm sorry about the balls!
It was a lucky shot, that's all!
What?!
I am not insane.
Do you hear me?
I am not insane!
Relax, buddy.
You're awake now.
This is not a Sutter Cane story!
This is not reality!
Not reality! Not reality!
This is reality.
Finga, finga, finga.
Finga.
Finga,
Finga.
Giorgio.
Do you have to drive so fast, Signor Giannetti?
This is not fast, Signora.
Is it far?
No.
Ecco! Castelo D'Orsino.
What does it look like?
It's up on a hill, Beck, just like in a fairy tale.
No, no.
Hold on, sweetie.
You'll catch cold.
You know, when I got your letter, Mr. Giannetti,
I thought it was a scam.
A scam?
Well, it's just hard to believe
I've actually inherited a castle.
This way, Signora.
Signorina.
What's the matter, mom?
Nothing.
Just be careful where you walk around here, okay?
This part was built 700 years ago.
Welcome to Castle Reilly, ladies.
Oh, it is cold, mama.
Have the rooms been prepared, Signor?
Of course, follow me.
I still don't understand how John is related to the Duchess.
I hired an investigation agency, and we found you, Signor Reilly.
You are the son of the late Duchess' sister, the last D'Orsino.
Daddy, I think he's saying that you're the Duke.
Yes, your father is the legal heir of the title and the castle, and the possessions it contains.
I'm afraid the family lost their fortune during the war.
So there is no money.
Mr. Giannetti?
Yes?
How soon can you liquidate the assets of the estate?
Oh, you want to sell?
Yes, everything, as soon as possible.
How much is the estate worth?
Oh, that is impossible to say.
No one but the duchess has been in the castle for 40 years.
This is my sister, Agnese.
She will cook and clean the rooms for you.
Hello, I'm John Reilly.
- This is my wife, Susan...
- Hi.
...and our daughter Rebecca.
Your room is here.
The girl is next door.
Grazie, Signora.
Your mother and you...
...are the Signora and
Signorina of the Castelo.
I'm the housekeeper.
There is much to do if you want to sell the castle.
So, we'll need a list of all the possessions.
An inventory?
Si, si, an inventory.
I must talk to an agent.
Thank you.
Sorry, I have to go.
Arrive derci.
- Bye bye.
- Ciao.
Thanks.
Well, are you staying in the castle, Agnese?
Si, I've a room by the kitchen.
Could you prepare another room for tonight?
Somebody's coming?
Well, it's for my husband.
Si, I'll make another room.
Supper is pasta and vitello?
Vitello?
Si.
Oh, well,
I'm sure that will be lovely.
Thank you very much.
You stay only a little in the castelo?
You sell, and then you go.
Soon.
As soon as we finish our business.
That good.
You sell and then you go.
Soon.
Who is it?
It's me.
Hi.
Hi.
What do you want?
Well, I thought since it's the first night in a new place, that we could make a fresh start of it.
I was just about to go to bed, John.
I took my pill.
Well, I could wake you up, Sleeping Beauty.
You are in my...
- ...castle, you know.
- Don't want it.
You are so beautiful.
John, please, I can't.
I miss you, Susan.
I miss you so, so much.
Stop it!
For Christ's sake.
- It's been nine months.
- I know, I know!
I haven't touched a drop.
I know, you've been very good...
...and I know that
I should try to forgive you, that I should want to forgive you, but I can't.
Then why are you here?
Why did you even come with--
She's in the next room.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to bed now.
Maybe we should pull over until it lets up.
I told your mother that
I would pick you up...
...and I would have you home for dinner.
We're already late.
How ya doin' back there, JJ?
Fine.
Hey! Hey, get back in your seat.
I can get it.
I said get back in your seat, JJ!
Daddy!
Becky?
JJ?
JJ!
JJ!
JJ!
No!
No!
JJ?
JJ?
Ah, God.
Do you need help?
No, thank you,
I just cut myself.
In the middle of the night?
Well, I was looking for the bathroom and I fell.
Did something wake you?
Why, did something wake you?
Old people sleep only a little.
You heard it too, didn't you?
Heard what?
Moaning.
Like a child crying?
My brother, he did not tell you...
...the story?
No, thank you.
I don't drink.
What story?
The Duchess had a son, Giorgio.
Le bambino bello.
A beautiful child.
Well, why didn't he inherit all this?
He died when he was only five years old.
Five?
How did he die?
No one knows.
The husband of the Duchess.
She married an American after the war.
He abandoned her and his little boy.
Soon after that,
Giorgio was buried.
Then, the Duchess dismissed everybody and lived alone.
She never left the castle, for 42 years until she died.
Losing a child is the worst grief there is.
And the worst guilt.
When her American left her, the Duchess went pazzo.
Crazy.
Some in town, they say she took revenge and killed his son.
Jesus, it was her son, too.
Yes, it's against nature, against God.
Why are you telling me this?
Some in town, they also say that late at night, when the streets are quiet, you can hear Giorgio crying.
A child crying.
They say the castle is haunted.
Il libro è verde.
The book is green.
Il libro è verde.
Il libro è verde.
Il lago è azzurro.
The lake is blue.
Il lago è azzurro.
Il lago è azzurro.
Il fiore è rosso.
The flower is red.
Il fiore è rosso.
Sweetie, are you okay?
What's wrong?
I'm fine, really.
What kind of flowers are those?
Oh, I'm not sure, really.
I got them outside around the castle.
Hello, ladies.
I'm going to start making an inventory of what we got here.
The booty.
You want to tag along, Beck?
Get the lay of the land?
Sure!
Well, I'm not sure that's a good idea.
We'll stay on this floor.
Come on, Beck, let's go.
Here, be careful, okay?
Stop worrying so much, mom, we'll be fine.
Oh.
What?
It's a room full of toys, Beck.
It's a nursery, I think.
Here, Beck.
What?
What's that?
A horse.
A rocking horse.
Right.
Oh, wow!
What?
Let's set you down on this bed.
Right there.
While I look around for booty.
Oh, it looked like somebody lived in this room.
Now, if you were a Duchess, where would you hide your jewellery?
I don't know.
Under the bed?
Why not?
Worth a try.
Daddy!
Is it there?
No, sweetheart.
It's not there.
Just some junk.
Oh.
We keep looking.
Okay.
Daddy?
Do you hear anything like, scratching?
No.
Daddy?
Beck, just a second, please.
I'm looking at a few things.
Nice kitty.
Where are you?
Kitty?
Where are you going?
What do you want?
Where are you going, you crazy cat?
Beck?
Beck?
Rebecca?
This is silly.
Let's go back upstairs.
Wait!
What the heck is down here that's so important?
Oh, damn.
Oh, get out of here.
Go wherever you're going!
Jeez-louise.
Out of here.
Hello?
Oh.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Is that just you, you stupid cat?
Anybody there?
Come here.
Here, kitty!
Come out of there, kitty.
Come here, kitty.
Rebecca?
Daddy?
Rebecca?
Kitty, come on, I gotta go.
Rebecca!
Down here, Daddy!
Daddy?
Daddy, I'm coming.
Daddy?
Daddy!
Daddy?
Rebecca, where have you been?
I heard your father calling for you!
Why aren't you with him?
There's somebody else here!
What?
What are you talking about?
What happened?
There was a door and I opened it, and I followed this cat downstairs.
Downstairs?
Becky, how could you be so stupid?
You could have been hurt!
Well, I kinda, you know --
Oh no, You are hurt.
It's just a cut.
- It's really no big deal.
- There you are!
God, Beck, where were you?
She's hurt, John, because you let her run off.
Beck, what did you do?
She was right with me.
Yeah, what's your excuse this time?
We can't watch her every minute.
Well, you can't, obviously, can you?
Listen, listen, there's somebody in the castle!
Rebecca, you have to promise me that you won't do anything like that again.
You mean walk around like a normal person?
Look, if you want to explore the castle or the town, then all you have to do is tell me, and I'll go with you.
Mom, it's, it's my handicap.
It's my challenge.
I have to deal with it myself.
I know you do, sweetie.
I know you do, I'm sorry.
You don't have any friends here, and you're--
A friend would believe me, Mom.
You've got to listen to me.
There's somebody else in the castle.
Enough of this, okay?
Come on, put your glasses on.
Let's go to lunch.
Now sweetie,
I want you to know that
I am your friend, and I'll always be your friend.
And I'll always take care of you.
And I think you're just projecting, because you want to have somebody else here with you.
Is there a cat in the house, Agnese?
No.
But Gabriella, she loved cats.
Gabriella, was that the Duchess?
Si.
Oh, did you know her?
Si, I was the maid in the castle when she was a young girl.
Oh, what was she like?
She always got what she wanted.
If she did not...
Was she pretty?
She was beautiful.
Bella!
What?
Like you.
Oh, you must eat, you are too thin.
Oh, tell her, Agnese.
She eats like a bird.
Americans don't eat enough.
To share food makes a family.
No?
My god, this mirror broke!
Oh, that's all we need.
Seven more years of bad luck.
No, no, no, no.
The wood warped.
These things are so old, or, maybe there was a sudden change of temperature.
Or somebody else is in the castle.
Who's there?
Who are you?
I know you're there.
Sweetheart, what is it?
What is it, who is here?
Sweetie, what's the matter?
You having a dream?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
I believe you.
I'm going to go look around.
No, daddy, please be careful!
It's okay.
- It's okay, sweetie.
- It's all right, sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
It's okay, it's okay, sweetie.
It's okay, I'm here.
It's okay.
JJ?
JJ.
My baby boy.
So, your daughter heard something in her room last night, and she sensed something downstairs before that.
Is that correct?
Yes.
But you found no one on this floor or below, when you went to look.
No, but I heard crying.
Did you hear crying, Signora Reilly?
Well, no, I didn't.
What?
What did he say?
He says, so the door are locked and this is not evidence of entering by force.
No one has come to the castle from the outside.
But you won't know that for certain until you search the place, right?
Castle D'Orsino has more than 150 rooms.
We cannot spare the men to search with such little evidence.
Well, my daughter said that she did hear something.
I'm certain she did.
A castle makes many sounds, especially at night.
Everybody thinks I made it up.
No, I think maybe you didn't understand.
No, I think maybe you don't understand.
We want you to search the castle!
What about--
What about this mirror?
How did you hurt your hand, Signor Reilly?
What are you saying?
Are you saying I did it myself?
Why would I break my own mirror?
Maybe you don't like what you saw.
Susan?
John!
She didn't get much sleep last night, you know.
None of us did, come on.
I want to show you something.
Why, what is it?
Please, you've got to see this.
Come on.
It's in here, Susan.
That's really weird.
It's gone.
There was a picture right there, of a little boy who looked like JJ.
John.
No, I swear.
He looked exactly like JJ.
It was right there.
It was Giorgio.
The Duchess' son.
Look at this, Susan.
He died when he was five.
John, stop it.
This isn't funny.
You know, when I found this place last night and this picture, I felt--
I felt like it was JJ.
What are you talking about?
I felt like JJ was here.
Well, I feel him...
- ...sometimes, too.
- No, no, no.
It's different than that.
He was here.
John.
I know, that's why I wanted the police to look around, so they could find something.
He's dead.
JJ's dead.
I know.
Stop it, you're acting like a child.
Jesus, I know he's dead,
I was there.
But listen to me.
His spirit, his ghost, was here, Susan.
Now, Agnese says that this castle is haunt--
No, it's your conscience, John.
You are just in such serious denial, you don't even realize it.
No, no, no, no.
This is different.
No, it's always the same.
It's never your fault.
Your father was responsible for your drinking problem.
The university fired you...
...because you were politically incorrect.
And now you're trying to use JJ's death--
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!
It's not JJ's ghost, it's you, John.
It's you!
You were the one who was driving that car, drunk!
You blinded Becky!
You killed our son!
So what's left?
You just punishing me?
Yes, because God didn't.
He just let you walk away without a scratch.
Well, what do you want me to do?
I wish I could go back.
I wish it had been me.
Oh, so do I.
The international language, huh?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't smoke.
Sorry.
But, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you a drink?
Joe.
Give the lady whatever she wants.
You heard it.
Joe, give me another one.
What?
What, are you tryin'--
Oh, shit.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I'm sorry.
He's trying to tell you that he's closing the bar.
Really?
You mean he's closing it to me.
You go home to your family.
Okay, okay, hold.
Listen up, I get it.
I'm going.
I've caused enough trouble as it is.
This is for your trouble, Joe.
Hey.
Oh, and that's for her, whatever she wants.
What?
I owe you a glass of wine, don't I?
I know where this nice quiet place, that's open all night.
Excellent.
Chateau Reilly.
Yes.
Quiet.
Sound travels in this place.
We don't want to be disturbed, right?
Okay?
Please.
You have to go.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, really, you were wonderful.
I just...
I have to go.
What?
What?
Centomila.
Of course.
Of course.
Here.
Well, just fucking take it.
No, take it please.
Just take it!
Oh!
Officer.
I came to see you,
Signor Reilly.
Alone, please.
Well, you'll see me, too.
What do you want?
We need your help to find Sylvana Lucci.
Who?
She didn't come home last night.
Well, I don't know anything about this.
The last time anyone saw her, she was going into the castle with you.
Well, she's not here, officer.
And no one here has seen her since last night?
I said she's not here.
Do you mind if I look inside?
Yesterday, you couldn't be bothered and now you want to look around.
Yesterday, you asked us to look and now you refuse?
Why shouldn't he look around, John?
Because he just wants to hassle me, that's why.
Sylvana Lucci has a small child.
So you see, a mother is missing.
Am I suspect?
Has there been a crime?
No, so there's no need for you to look around, is there?
Then you won't mind coming to the station to answer some questions?
I'm not going to answer any questions...
...until I talk to my lawyer.
You brought a woman here?
I was lonely.
You were drunk.
Sus...
You are not listening to me.
I am listening to you,
I just don't agree with you.
Mom, if he's drinking again, he'll need us more than ever.
I am tired, Becky.
I am just so tired, I--
I think if we stay together, one of us will go crazy.
If what you tell me, Giovanni, is all that happened, there is no evidence against you.
It is all that happened.
Then they will find
Sylvana Lucci... or they will find some explanation... and you'll be innocent.
You know of course, that the Signorina and carabinieri were lovers.
What?
She's a prostitute.
She must have screwed half the guys in this town.
Myself included.
But all the other men did not have a child with her.
She had his kid?
Yes.
He denies it, but everyone knows it's his.
He's a charming little boy.
Il telefono.
Don't worry, there is no evidence.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
That was my sister calling from the castle.
She has found Sylvana Lucci's what do you call...
Handbag.
She must have left it.
That's not something a woman leaves.
I'm afraid now, they, they're going to arrest you.
What?
That's ridiculous.
I didn't do anything.
Yes, but the police find the handbag.
Oh, Jesus.
What are we going to do?
I'm your lawyer.
I believe you, but that is not evidence.
And then, carabinieri, they don't need to be told.
I swear,
I didn't do anything to her.
Then we agree.
I'll have Agnese bring me the handbag.
I'll keep it until they find Signora Lucci.
Then, all we'll have to discuss, is our new financial agreement.
What are you talking about?
Because of new problems with your case,
I must raise my fee.
That's blackmail.
You bastard.
I think it's time you learned the truth.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your father's first wife.
It was a great scandal.
The Duchess D'Orsino married an American soldier.
What? What are you--
The Duchess?
Yes, they got married.
Then they had a child.
Then your father got tired of both of them, and he ran off with her younger sister to America.
No, my parents never said anything about this.
Why would they?
The Duchess would never give him a divorce.
She's nobility.
So, the marriage of your father with her sister was not legal, no good.
No!
Yes.
Your father was never married to your mother.
So, you, Giovanni, are the bastard.
Thank you.
Get in the car, Rebecca.
Susan!
I have to say goodbye.
No, get in the car.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
We're leaving, John.
No, listen.
Listen, they're going to arrest me.
For what?
That woman is still missing.
I need your help.
You brought a whore into our home, John.
Into our home, with Becky there.
Look, I know that but if you leave me, it's going to look like I'm guilty.
I should have left you two years ago.
Susan, please!
I'm begging you.
You made yourself into a whipping boy, John.
Don't blame me.
Go.
Whipping boy?
Whipping boy.
Why would she have a whip?
Susan!
I think I know what happened, what's happening.
And I can prove it!
Bye Daddy!
I'll see you again sweetheart, I promise!
Yes?
I'm sorry, Signora Reilly but we must take your husband to the Carabinieri station to answer some questions.
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll be able to explain himself.
We must also search the castle.
Fine, do whatever you have to do.
My daughter and I are catching the train to Rome.
I must ask you both to stay in Orsino.
We will require statements from you.
But we don't know anything about any of this.
But you understand that we must ask.
And first we have to talk to your husband.
We are grateful for your cooperation.
Well, don't be.
You're keeping us here against our will.
Where is Agnese?
I don't know, really.
We wanted to say goodbye, but we couldn't find her.
Where are the stairs, please?
Somebody needs to stay with my daughter.
He's a policeman honey, he'll stay with you, okay.
It's alright.
Grimaldi.
What's going on mom?
John.
What are you doing?
Rebecca is right.
There is someone else in the castle.
God, forgive you.
It is nothing but rocks.
He's not here.
Who, Signor.
Giorgio D'Orsino, he was never buried.
She kept him alive.
He's alive.
Don't you see?
He's here.
He's here somewhere in the castle.
Where is my sister?
I don't know where your sister is.
Maybe he took her.
Come with us, Signora Reilley.
What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
Wait a minute.
Check upstairs, in the Duchess's room.
She has a whip.
Why would she have a whip?
Who's she going to use it on?
Think, for Christ's sake.
She never let anyone in, right?
But who was here to begin with, at the start?
Her son, he didn't die.
She had him hid away.
She made him into a whipping boy to get back at my father for leaving her.
Very clever.
He's the one that broke the mirror.
He's the one that was in
Rebecca's room, I'm telling you.
You've got to search the castle.
Oh my God.
You are under arrest.
What?
I didn't do this.
Why would I do this?
You should be careful what you say, until you talk to your lawyer.
Susan, I didn't do this.
I swear, I need your help.
Please, I know it.
I need your help, I'm innocent.
I didn't do it!
Please, go back.
Yes?
Grimaldi and Benedetti will stay here tonight.
You can bring your daughter to the station tomorrow, and give your testimony.
Alright, thank you.
You alright?
Okay.
Buona notte.
Goodnight.
Could you get us some water?
Acqua, per favore.
Acqua, si.
Can you get someone in here who speaks English?
English!
Damn it!
It's okay.
Officer.
Officer, would you please listen to me.
Then you are prepared to answer some questions.
I will answer any questions that you want, but you have got to get my family out of that castle.
Why?
Why, because there is a madman in there and my family is in danger.
And who is this madman,
Giorgio D'Orsino?
You saw the coffin.
You saw that it was empty.
Why would the Duchess bury an empty coffin?
That was 40 years ago.
I want more about last night.
Why did you kill Sylvana?
I keep telling you over, and over, and over again.
I didn't kill her!
It was him!
No more fairy tales.
Tell me the truth.
Hello!
Yes.
We asked for water.
Acqua, do you know if it's coming?
Yes, acqua, acqua.
I go, I go.
Thank you.
Benedetti!
It's coming, Sweetie.
Benedetti!
Bene...
We're going to get through this, sweetie.
You'll see.
We're going to be home, soon.
Do you really think daddy's a murderer?
You do.
You think he killed JJ.
I thought you guys must love JJ more than me.
What, why would you say that?
Because you hate each other so much, since he died.
Oh, sweetie.
We both love you so much, you know that, don't you?
I know.
And no matter what, your father needs our prayers.
So pray with me, okay.
Heavenly father, please watch over us, and protect us in this time of trouble.
And help my mother forgive my father.
And God, please help us put our family back together.
- Amen.
- Amen.
We'll figure out what to do in the morning, okay.
I think I'm getting one of my headaches.
Okay, I have your pills right here.
I just thought that we'd never get back to normal.
Where's that water?
Mom, are you listening to me?
Yes sweetie, I'm listening.
I don't care that things won't be normal again.
Normal sucks.
Becky.
No, really.
Well, I don't have to worry about all that stupid stuff, like cars and prom and stuff.
When I get a boyfriend, automatically be a special person because he won't care that I'm blind.
And I'll have to judge him by what he's really like not by what he looks like.
It'll have to be love, the real thing.
Mom?
It's you!
Help!
Please.
Please, I have answered all of your questions.
And now I want you to get my daughter and my wife out of that castle, now.
You don't give orders here. and you will answer questions until we are satisfied with your answers.
Now, tell me again, why did you kill Sylvana?
I didn't kill her,
I fucked her, okay.
No!
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
Please, let me go.
Please.
The police are here.
They'll find you, they will.
No, no!
Stop!
Mom!
Let her go.
Let her go!
Take me.
No, mom, no!
Come on, take me.
Take me!
Run, mom, run!
Get up, get up, come on!
Oh no.
Mom, look at him, he's coming.
Giorgio!
John!
Daddy!
John.
John!
Daddy!
John.
John.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
John, I love you.
I...
I love you.
Stroke! Stroke!
Stroke! Stroke!
Stroke! Stroke!
Come on, come on.
Pick him up, pick him up.
Son of a bitch!
I mean, Your Honor, that was a hell of a shot.
Well, I'm currently doing an externship for two extra credits
as a clerk for Judge Hookstratten.
B.J. Hookstratten?
That's more impressive than being in the top 5%.
Look, I don't know what kind of offers you've had from Wall Street...
The top five, sir. In my class.
Not the top 5%.
I'm sorry, I just...
Mr. McDeere, we've just offered you $68,000 a year from arguably the leading law firm in Chicago.
Is there somewhere else you have to be?
Yes, sir. I have a job.
I'm just on lunch break.
I know you've had a lot of offers.
Did you know, for example, that we have 127 clients
that are Fortune 500 companies?
Now, look, we'll offer you $74, 000...
...our billing requirement for a first-year associate is only 2,000 hours, not the usual 25 or 26 or 2,700.
We want you to have a life outside the office, Mitch.
And if you're a Lakers fan, we have a fabulous box at the Forum.
I know there are firms from all over the country
that have been up here offering you everything.
But with your ability and ambition, there is only one place for you,
and that's with our firm in Washington...
Let's stop talking about the ribbon on the package,
and start talking about what's in the package.
One of our partners is an ex-governor, two are congressmen
and one's a former
Senator of Agriculture.
May I take your coat, sir?
- Mitchell McDeere, right?
- Yes.
Lamar Quinn. Come on in.
I'd like you to meet
- Oliver Lambert, our senior partner.
- Mitch. Mitch.
- How do you do, sir?
- This is Royce McKnight,
- our managing partner.
- How do you do, sir?
- Welcome.
- Care for a drink?
- No, I'm fine.
- Take a seat, Mitch.
Tired of interviews?
No, sir. I just don't quite know what to say.
Unusual for a lawyer.
I can get tongue-tied in any number of situations, sir, but it's usually with my wife.
Would you mind describing one, with your wife?
The first time I saw her.
Any time we argue.
Whenever she walks into a room, as a matter of fact.
Might we ask about the rest of your family?
My father was killed in the coal mines and my mother remarried and lives in Florida.
Brothers and sisters?
None.
Mitch, I hope you don't think us intrusive, but stability in the family has a special importance for us.
Bendini, Lambert & Locke is just a small Memphis firm,
41 lawyers.
But we're a large family.
So we're careful.
Now, sir, do you have any questions for us?
Do you have an offer in mind?
It includes a bonus schedule, a low-interest mortgage so you can buy a home, country club membership, and we'll lease you a new Mercedes.
You pick the color, Mitch.
Lamar, you haven't been paying attention.
His wife picks the color.
- Do I... Do I open it here?
- Of course.
Unless you can tell us what's in it.
A lawyer worth that offer shouldn't have to open the envelope.
Mr. McKnight, you are the managing partner at Bendini, Lambert & Locke, is that correct?
Yes.
Did Mr. Lambert, as senior partner, give you any instructions regarding my employment?
He did.
And, Mr. McKnight, do you usually follow Mr. Lambert's instructions?
Objection.
Vague. Ambiguous.
Sustained.
What precisely were those instructions?
That you were in great demand, and I should make certain that we obtained your services before a bidding situation developed.
How did you go about making certain?
I bribed a clerk in the Harvard
Law placement office for the exact amount of the highest offer, and then added 20%.
Mitch, the letter you got from Bendini, Lambert & Locke was the only one sent out.
We want you.
Okay.
You're gonna have to leave now.
I'm expecting my husband.
The hell with him.
Come here.
Moo shu pork, Szechwan beef, mandarin duck from Wong Boys.
It's even got a cork.
What's going on?
You remember the letter I got from that firm in Memphis?
Memphis?
That's what I thought, until their offer.
What was the offer?
They didn't say.
It's in there.
It's sealed.
I guessed.
What?
Yeah, but I'm a good guesser.
Plus a 5% increase the second year.
Why?
"Why?"
Whose side are you on anyway?
Yours.
Plus bonuses, plus a low interest mortgage...
As in a home, with grass around it?
They want to fly us down to Memphis for a little visit.
If you've been in one limo, you've been in them all.
Bye. See you later, Your Honor.
Sir.
Hey, Mitch.
Come on, associates first, then lunch with the partners in our private dining room.
He's our number one draft pick, so to speak, and he's being romanced by the big boys from New York and Chicago and everywhere else, so we have to sell him on our little firm here in Memphis.
Meanwhile, he's gonna try not to be embarrassed while I remind you that he's about to graduate from Harvard with honors.
Hear, hear.
No one's divorced in the Firm?
No one's divorced in the Firm.
- Impossible.
- No bachelors either.
What about women?
- They had one once.
- Only one?
Alice Krauss, wobbled around on 4" heels.
Affirmative action on stilts.
All white, all male, all married, huh?
- What the hell is this?
- There he goes.
Hey!
It's different from the northeast.
The pace, we're almost stately by comparison.
Courteous and not as gossipy.
We keep each other's secrets.
I like that.
What do you like about it?
All of it. It's a family.
Just the way you said.
For the last three years,
I've been teaching in the Boston area at a private school.
Do you work?
Well, not since
I put Lamar through law school.
But, you know, working isn't forbidden.
- Forbidden?
- Working, by the Firm, you know.
- How could it be forbidden?
- It isn't.
Anyway, two babies in 14 months and I had all the work I could handle.
- Do you plan to start a family?
- Maybe in a couple of years.
The Firm encourages children.
How do they do that exactly?
Hey, how about it?
How about it.
Okay, okay. The Love Boat band, the secret recipe ribs, they're a little square maybe...
I don't mind square.
I like square. Weird, I mind.
What do you mean, "weird"?
Well, here's a quote.
"The Firm does not forbid me to take a job, and they encourage children."
Ask me why.
Because they love kids.
Because children promote stability.
Want to hear more?
No, you're right.
Don't pay any attention. I'm just gonna throw myself over the rail.
- I think my will is self-explanatory.
- Okay, okay, okay.
These are nice people, Abby.
These are nice people.
Okay.
I'm more impressed with it than you are.
You grew up with it.
Do you know what
$96,000 a year is here?
It's like 150 in New York.
Did you ever think
I'd make a six-figure salary?
Absolutely.
You did?
Well, your folks! Your folks are only a few hours away, too.
You mean, if we fight,
I don't have far to drive.
Exactly.
She made two phone calls from the hotel, one to her parents and one to the Memphis School Board.
She seemed a little reluctant.
I'd hate to lose this young man.
I think she'll come around.
What about Kozinski and Hodges?
Have you spoken to Chicago?
I have.
It's not good.
We're gonna have to do something.
I drew the happy face.
Where's Memphis?
Is that it?
- Yeah?
- It looks different.
It's prettier than the pictures they sent.
"Mitch and Abby, we've taken the liberty of furnishing the house temporarily.
"Just a few things to make you feel at home.
"Hope you don't mind."
Abby!
Not bad, huh?
Where's yours?
- Don't get up.
- Don't worry.
Mitchell McDeere.
Tad eager are we, Mr. McDeere?
What are you doing?
Dutch says you've been here since 6:30.
I thought I'd jump start the bar exam work.
Good. No associate has ever failed the bar exam, you know.
Come on.
I'll show you your new office.
Wally Hudson, Contracts.
- Here to help with the bar exam.
- Thanks, Wally.
No associate of the Firm has ever failed the bar exam.
The first day is a four-hour multiple choice on ethics.
Look at the first six chapters.
I'll see you Wednesday, 8:45.
Oh, no associate of this firm has ever failed the bar exam.
No kidding.
- Ken Curry. Domestic Relations.
- Mike Allen. Wills and Estates.
Nina.
Fuck! Please.
I'm sorry. Can I help you?
Actually,
I think I'm here to help you.
I'm Avery Tolar, your designated mentor.
Let's go to lunch.
Lunch? But it's not even...
Not even noon, I know.
It will be a working lunch.
Come on up to my office while I drop this off.
Everything depends on billing.
How many hours you spend even thinking about a client.
I don't care if you're stuck in traffic or shaving or sitting on a park bench.
Now, my particular field...
Is forming limited partnerships for offshore corporations, mainly in the Cayman Islands.
Good. I want you to review the last one
I did for a client named Sonny Capps.
He made over 14 million last year, paid less than 4% in taxes and resents every buck of it.
But he paid us $400,000 in fees, so I don't want to make him unhappy.
Take a look at the deal, see if you can come up with anything.
Madge, tell him
I'll call him in the morning, please.
Yes, Mr. Tolar.
Should I save these for later?
- Could you, please?
- What do you mean by "anything"?
What do you think I mean?
I don't know, you're the risk taker.
Do you think I'm talking about breaking the law?
No, I'm just trying to figure out how far you want it bent.
As far as you can without breaking it.
In other words, don't risk an IRS audit.
I don't give a damn about an audit.
They just better not win.
Yes, Mr. Tolar?
Something before lunch?
I should warn you the Firm frowns on drinking during office hours.
Iced tea, please.
Bombay martini on the rocks,
Ellis, three olives.
On the way.
Senator.
I'm allowed a few minor rebellions.
- Put that in the bedroom, please.
- Hey, hon, I made you some tea.
Kay, please. I've never had so many people trying to do things for me.
It's the South, Abby.
We encumber you with hospitality.
Would you like to have your phone programmed for speed dialing, ma'am?
Other than my husband's office number, let's see, that's...
We have it, Mrs. McDeere. We do all the installations for the Firm.
Oh.
What led you to law school?
- I can't remember, really.
- Sure you can, Counselor.
I was a delivery boy for a pizza parlor.
One day the owner got a notice from the IRS.
He was an immigrant, didn't know much English, even less about withholding tax.
He went bankrupt.
Lost his store.
That was the first time
I thought of being a lawyer.
In other words, you're an idealist.
I don't know any tax lawyer who's an idealist.
When he lost his store, I lost my job, and it scared me.
- Being out of work?
- No.
What the government can do to anybody.
What about you?
What led you to law school?
It's so far back
I don't think I can remember.
Sure you can, Counselor.
I used to caddie for young lawyers off from work on weekdays and their wives.
I'd look at those long tan legs and just knew I had to be a lawyer.
The wives had long tan legs, too.
Ellis, another martini, please.
So we're not a couple of idealists.
Heaven forbid.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'll let Mrs. Quinn know you're here.
- Are you sure it's today?
- That's what he told me.
Kay?
There's been...
Marty Kozinski and
Joe Hodges were killed.
We just got word about 20 minutes ago.
Did you meet them at the barbecue?
What happened, Kay?
We're not sure.
They were diving off a boat on Grand Cayman, and then there was some kind of explosion on the boat.
Lamar?
Marty was...
His twin girls are a month older than our son.
I'm very sorry, Lamar.
Oh.
By the way, Oliver wanted me to tell you, you shouldn't be burdened with a student loan.
Excuse me?
If you bring the papers by tomorrow, the Firm will repay it for you.
Kay was scared.
What? No, she was upset.
There is a difference between being upset and being scared.
She was scared.
Of what?
What, do you know her that well?
Maybe not.
But I've spent a lot of time with her lately.
They have their own horses.
Two of them. Quarter Horses.
Does that make half a horse?
Sorry. I...
...and gently wipe away every tear from our eyes.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Let us pray.
Lord our God, you are always faithful and quick to show mercy.
Our brother Marty was suddenly and violently taken from us.
Come swiftly to his aid.
Have mercy on him, and comfort his family and friends by the power and protection of the cross.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Let us go in the peace of Christ.
I'm just gonna go say goodbye to Oliver.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right.
Mrs. McDeere, I'm Avery Tolar.
Oh!
You're the reason I see so little of my husband these days.
He must be the most ambitious man in the world.
One of them.
No, I mean leaving you every day just to go off to work.
I'm sure you could manage.
Just tell me how.
Did you know them well?
The men who died?
Yes.
You must be overwhelmed with grief.
People grieve in different ways, Mrs. McDeere.
Abby!
Hey, Hearsay, come here.
Shit.
- Is he in?
- Yes, Mr. Tolar.
Hell of a proposal, kiddo.
Just redraft this section on repatriation of offshore funds.
I need it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? I need another week!
- Can't have it, pal.
You and I are flying to the Caymans tomorrow morning to take on Mr. Sonny Capps personally.
But the bar exam!
It will be here when you get back, kiddo.
Shall I stay, Mr. McDeere?
Would you like me to pick you up a sandwich?
No, I'm fine, Nina. Thank you.
You go on home.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- So what's good here?
- I'm just having coffee.
I'm going with the steak sandwich.
Two steak sandwiches on rolls, please.
Two steak sandwiches on rolls.
You with Bendini,
Lambert & Locke?
Yeah. How did you...
Ah! Sorry, I'm just a little...
It looks like they're working you to death.
They do that with new associates,
I guess.
- I've just been with them now...
- Eight weeks.
Sorry, guys.
I'm just a little punchy.
That firm looks like a health hazard.
- Hours they make you keep.
- Kind of work they make you do.
Kozinski and Hodges.
Bob Lamm and Alice Krauss.
That's four dead lawyers out of 41 in less than 10 years.
And none of them over the age of what, 45?
I mean, that beats the hell out of any life insurance tables I've ever heard about.
Who are you guys?
Could we get those sandwiches to go, please?
We'll probably see each other again.
The car wouldn't start.
I got caught in this incredible accident,
12 cars, maybe 13.
There was a pregnant woman in one of them.
I had to help deliver the baby.
It was a girl.
They said they're gonna name her Abigail.
Come on, Abby. Why do you think
I'm working like this, huh?
- 'Cause I want you to have all the stuff...
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I never asked for anything, Mitch, except for us to be together.
But I want to give it to you.
I want to give you everything you gave up to marry me.
Stop it.
It's sweet. I know.
It's some kind of courtship, but I don't need all that.
Just bring me flowers sometime.
What were you working on all night?
Just, you know, it's...
It's just this stuff Avery's got me doing for the Cayman trip.
Hey, want to have some eggs?
I had some eggs.
Want to have some naked?
You don't even know what moves me about you, do you?
Mitch, I know what you want, but it's not for me.
It's not even for you.
And you know it.
It's easy for somebody rich to talk about being poor like it's some fly that's bothering you and you just wave it away.
This isn't about rich or poor.
This is about trying to fix something that won't get fixed with 10 Mercedes.
Hey, that's not fair, Abby!
That's not fair!
This is about a mother in a trailer park.
And a brother you pretend you don't have.
Have a nice trip.
Just follow me, and don't over-breathe.
What about Sonny Capps?
I thought we were under a lot of pressure.
We're under tremendous pressure.
If we don't get this dive in before the bank, we can't do it.
You can't dive and then fly within 24 hours.
I don't see how you can dive so soon after the accident.
We don't even know what happened to Kozinski and Hodges.
Hey, there was a plane crash last week.
We didn't take a boat to the Caymans, did we?
That's ridiculous, Sonny.
Let us sit down with you for five minutes. Thank you.
Son of a bitch pays less than 5% tax and wants to fire us. The Hyatt!
This new plan is very aggressive, Sonny, and it defers all your tax liability for years. And you could start right away.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I can't talk right now.
These taxes are only deferred, right?
The future value of the tax dollars will be less than half their present value.
- Who says?
- After the election...
Are you telling me who's gonna be in the White House the next four years,
'cause that would be valuable information.
- Well...
- Mr. Tolar has a plan that...
That meets all your needs, whoever's in the White House.
- Let him tell me.
- He's been trying to.
Hey, who the fuck are you?
His lawyer or mine?
- Neither one, sir.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
Sonny, you're not the Firm's only concern here.
We put you into deals with other clients where they may be very sensitive about exposing their relationships to outside attorneys.
You hear that, Counselor?
That's a veiled threat.
If you're talking about our friends in Chicago, they don't make money when I pay you fees.
You make money when I pay you fees.
They make money being in business with me.
And as long as they're making money, they don't give a flying fuck who does my taxes.
Hey, you don't know me.
I'm a nice guy.
You lose a million bucks for me,
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna break your legs.
Sonny, let's don't get carried away here, all right?
What did I say?
Maybe it's what you didn't say.
- "What I didn't say." What didn't I say?
- Thank you.
Mr. Tolar handed you a schedule that virtually guarantees you zero tax with zero risk.
The basis of your stock would be the face amount of the installment note, but the stock would have no value.
Even so, it's deducted in offsets income.
You defer your tax in full even though you have a bankable LC.
- Deferred till when?
- What do you care?
Whenever it is, it's still the best interest free loan you'll ever get.
So the worst is, I pay my taxes much, much later.
No.
The worst thing is next year they're going to close the loophole, change the regs and if you haven't grabbed this proposal, you're gonna feel like you were fucked with a dick big enough for an elephant to feel it.
You know that for a fact?
Hey, you like the word "protege"?
I never had one. You ever been one?
I'm A, you're B, right next door.
Avery, who's in Chicago?
We'll get to all that.
The hell with it.
Clean up and come on over.
You earned a good dinner and a night out.
Hey.
I lost my son.
Don't you think I would have screamed bloody murder if I thought something was wrong?
You're right, Mr. Abanks, I'm sorry.
Okay? You're right. I'm sorry.
Nothing to bury even.
Just a stone.
They never did find him or the other two.
What other two?
The other two who split the charter.
Your friends and two other guys.
- Lawyers?
- They were in swim suits.
They paid cash.
Were they American?
Could have been anything.
One was, I don't know, squat, heavy.
Other guy had long blond hair, almost white, with weird blue eyes.
- Mitch?
- Yeah.
Grab a Red Stripe out of the fridge.
I'm a little slow.
Take your time.
I'm trying to look as pretty as you, which I'm convinced I can.
It just takes me a little longer.
You got anything to munch on?
Yeah, there's a thing full of stuff next to the fridge.
It's got a lock on it. Use that key from the ring I gave you.
Do you see it?
Yeah, sure.
You find something?
Listen, Capps is a tough guy, but he's also a blowhard.
He loves to give the impression that he's connected.
Thinks it's glamorous.
He said a couple of things.
Hey, you're about to take the bar exam.
Here's a multiple choice.
The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is...
A, whatever the IRS says.
B, a smart lawyer.
C, 10 years in prison.
D, all of the above.
Being a tax lawyer's got nothing to do with the law.
It's a game.
We teach the rich how to play it, so they can stay rich.
The IRS keeps changing the rules so we can keep getting rich teaching them.
It's a game. One you just played very, very well.
Where's your beer?
I decided to wait for the rum.
I hear it's good down here.
Everything's good down here.
You deserve a taste of all of it.
I think that since we're here on this island, there's things we can do on it, you know, primitive things.
Come on, you deserve it.
Look, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but this isn't gonna happen.
Would you tell my friend
I went back to the condo?
You don't know what you're missing.
Thanks anyway.
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me.
Are you all right?
It's okay.
Just wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Can I look at this?
You're not a doctor.
No, but I've sprained a lot of ankles.
Mostly mine.
You should ice this.
You should also report that guy.
That was your boyfriend.
That was for money.
Oh.
- Aren't you gonna finish?
- I'm sorry.
- You think that's...
- Got nothing to do with me.
- Is this too tight?
- No.
I work in a travel agency.
I wanted to feel like all those people with first class tickets and pretty clothes.
I guess I wanted to feel...
Rich.
How much would it take to feel rich?
I don't know.
How much would it take to feel safe?
You did that.
You made me feel safe.
Hey...
Will you stay with me for a while?
Why don't you take the afternoon off?
You deserve it.
Spend it with that pretty wife of yours.
Oh, shit, I forgot, she phoned last night.
What'd you tell her?
That you were probably walking on the beach.
I was.
I guessed right then, didn't I?
Okay, Mr. McDeere.
If you'll sign where the "X" is and initial where it's marked.
Well, well. The man from
Gentleman's Quarterly.
How you doing, Ray?
Pretty fair. How's yourself?
It's a long time, huh?
It's okay.
I've become a patient man.
Don't beat yourself up, kid.
If I wasn't here,
I wouldn't want to be here either.
- Do you ever talk to Ma?
- A few months ago.
- Still with the same guy?
- They're all the same guy.
So, you finish law school?
Yeah.
That suit's a dead give-away.
What, you get a job on Wall Street?
- You always said...
- No, I'm not. I just...
I went with a firm across the river in Memphis.
Memphis?
Hey, Ray, wouldn't it be funny if I went to Harvard and you went to jail and we both ended up surrounded by crooks?
Sonny Capps is thrilled.
McDeere was dazzling.
I think we ought to pull Lamar out of that tax seminar in Washington and send Mitch instead.
Let him take the jet.
Any problem with that, Bill?
No. No, no problem.
So far the kid's been real predictable.
If you're even half right, you're gonna need some help. What does Abby think?
I haven't told her.
I guess...
I guess I don't want it to be real.
Nothing's real until
I tell it to Abby.
How did you ever land a job with a brother in the joint?
That's okay. I'd have done the same thing myself.
You were always around for me, Ray.
All those years after Dad died.
I'd have done the same.
You think I'd ever tell guys around here I got a brother in Harvard?
Jesus, Ray.
Hey, listen. I want you to see a friend of mine.
His name is Eddie Lomax. He's a private investigator in Little Rock.
Ex-cop.
Anything I can do for you?
Sure. Get me out of here.
Where to?
Anywhere I can see a whole lot of sky.
I can get through the days,
I even eat the food.
It's amazing how much you miss the sky.
Ever plug one of these in only you forgot to put the water in?
No.
- Do you know what happens?
- No.
The lights go out.
He's been dying to see you since you called.
That's what I saw.
Tammy!
Mr. Lomax will see you now.
- Mr. McDeere.
- Yes.
I practically went to law school with you.
Ray talked about you every stinking day for three years.
I was his cellmate, he must have told you.
Did he tell you, by the way, it was statutory rape?
She was 17. Looked 25.
I got one to four.
Sit down. Sit down. Come on. Sit down, sit down. You want some Sweet'N Low?
- You want some dairy cream?
- No.
You want some sugar?
You want some...
Eddie, I've got some business
- I'd like to go over with you here.
- Good. Good. Good.
I owe your brother my life.
- I'm leaving.
- Thank you, dear.
That's my secretary.
She is terrific.
But she's got a nutcase for a husband. He's a truck driver.
He moved here to be close to Graceland.
The reason why, he thinks he's Elvis.
What do you think his name is?
It's Elvis. Elvis Aaron Hemphill.
I run across some strange things in this job.
Some things I'd never spray-paint on an overpass.
Now, what can I do for you?
- What a nice surprise.
- Avery.
They didn't have to disturb you.
You didn't have to come down.
Believe me, it's no bother.
I was just looking for Mitch.
Nina says he hasn't been in all afternoon.
I didn't mean for her to call you.
Didn't he come back with you?
I'll be honest with you.
This is not my area of expertise.
- But you think it's possible?
- Anything's possible.
I'll tell you one thing, if those guys at the steak joint were feds, you better watch out for them.
'Cause they don't give a damn about you.
I get some pretty pissed off husbands in here.
On the other hand, the lawyers at your firm sure as hell seem accident prone.
Okay.
I'll see what I can find out.
You better let me call you.
You sure remind me of your brother.
Ray comes up for parole in a while.
Says that he can last it.
What do you think?
There's guys that can do all the hard time the State gives them.
Whatever Ray had, he used up to get this far.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I didn't think you were home.
- Why not?
- No car.
- I took it in for service.
Avery brought me home.
I went to the office looking for you.
I wasn't there.
Apparently not.
I even looked under your desk.
- Yeah, I went...
- Avery told me you were at MSU, at the law library.
- Avery did.
- Avery did.
But when I happened to spot your car in the parking lot, it made him kind of edgy.
Yeah, well, Avery didn't exactly know where I was.
Oh.
Probably thought you were with another woman.
I went to see Ray.
Ray?
- Yeah.
- Just like that, after all this time?
You were right.
I've been stupid.
I would have gone with you on Saturday.
I know. God, I just wasn't...
I wasn't thinking.
How'd it go?
It was...
It was...
God, he...
He tried to make it easy for me.
Is he okay?
He's gotta get that parole.
You want to try something?
Let's put the books away, pretend we're back in our old beat-up apartment, broke, and we find some money we forgot in pockets.
- We'll send out for pizza and drink beer.
- Drink beer.
And watch Star Search.
Who knows where it will lead.
Your wife?
- She's in Cleveland.
- She lies.
Don't you answer your phone?
Don't you knock?
Where's your secretary?
Out.
- She left a cigarette burning.
- She does that.
Why don't you come back in one hour, and make an appointment?
Why bother? We're here.
I'm busy.
Doing what?
I'm getting a pedicure.
What's it to you?
Now this is gonna turn out badly for you, but we can make it relatively painless.
Why are you asking questions about dead lawyers?
What dead lawyers?
Who hired you to do that?
Okay! Okay.
Just let me think.
His name was Julio Iglesias.
No! No!
Great!
Just great.
You want to ask him a few questions now?
I think this is a carefully balanced proposal.
I think it's high-minded and I think it's fair-minded.
In other words, it's got something in it to offend everyone.
If you want to follow along with me,
we'll begin on page "I" of the introduction.
We'll revue sections 704-B of the IRS code of 1986
and the treasury regulations amended under Section 1/704-1.
Quote,
"The distribution provisions
"in limited and general partnership agreements."
These regulations permit the IRS to disregard allocations
which are not made in accordance
with partners' interests in the partnership
unless those allocations satisfy the economic effect
most easily satisfied
by taking advantage of the safe harbor provisions set forth therein.
In other words, in an ever-changing sea of tax laws...
Hey, brother.
Brother, go down the steps towards the pool.
Here you go, brother.
- Voices from the Wall.
- Thanks a lot.
Oh, yeah.
Mister.
Who killed Eddie Lomax?
Go over and sit next to the man on the bench.
I appreciate your coming,
Mr. McDeere.
I'll call you Mitch, if I may?
My name is Voyles.
Denton Voyles.
I'm with the Department of Justice.
What happened to Eddie Lomax?
We've been investigating Bendini,
Lambert & Locke for four years.
No lawyer has ever left your law firm alive.
Two tried to leave, they were killed.
Two were about to try, you know what happened.
Now, we have reason to believe that your house is bugged.
Your phones are tapped, your office is wired.
They may follow you, they may be here in Washington as we speak.
Are you saying my life is in danger?
I'm saying that your life as you know it is over.
Your law firm is the sole legal representative of the Morolto crime family in Chicago.
Known as the Mafia.
The Mob.
I don't believe it.
They set up legitimate businesses with dirty money from drugs, gambling, prostitution.
All cash, all moved offshore. You believe it.
That's why you talked to Thomas Abanks in the Caymans.
That's why you got this private investigator asking questions that got him killed.
Maybe 30% of their clients are legitimate.
They bring in a new rookie, throw money at him, buy the car, the house.
After a couple of years, and your kids are in private schools, you're used to the good life, they tell you the truth.
You mean every partner in the Firm is...
Every partner knows.
We suspect most of the associates.
Why don't you get indictments and bust it all up?
We have to have somebody on the inside.
We need to see copies of contracts, clients' bank records,
- articles of incorporation.
- Wait a minute.
- You think I'm...
- You can say no.
But we're gonna break this firm.
And when that happens, you're gonna go to jail along with the rest.
It will happen, son, believe me.
Why can't I just leave?
That's what Kozinski and
Hodges were trying to do.
You have to think this over.
Meanwhile, you and your wife have to behave as though everything is normal.
Now don't discuss this with anyone, but make a decision.
If you help us, we'll make it worth your while.
Worth my while?
You can still have a pretty good life.
You mean in a witness protection program?
How?
I live somebody else's life?
In some nowhere place, and one day
I'm backing out of my driveway and my car explodes?
Doesn't have to be that way.
I don't need much of a life,
Mr. Voyles, but it has to be mine.
Is that what you've got now, son?
You ought to get back to the seminar.
Tarrance has full authority to negotiate on our behalf.
Why don't you wander back past the memorial?
You can call me in Memphis anytime, day or night.
The second one's a mobile number.
Let me get this straight.
I steal files from the Firm and turn them over to the FBI.
Testify against my colleagues, send them to jail.
They suckered you into this.
Reveal privileged information that violates attorney-client confidences, get me disbarred, and then testify in open court against the Mafia.
- Well, unfortunately, Mitch...
- Let me ask you something.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
How long before they find out Lomax's cellmate was a guy named Ray McDeere?
And when they do, what do you think they'll do to him?
They can get to anyone, anywhere.
What can you do?
Your brother comes up for parole soon, doesn't he?
You cooperate with us, I'll guarantee the board will be grateful.
Otherwise... Well, you know what those parole hearings are like.
It could go either way.
Forget about home, driver.
Take me to the Firm.
- The employer will have...
- Mr. McDeere, you can't go in there!
Call everybody. Right now!
- I'm on overseas and I've got two...
- Right now!
I just had a little chat with the FBI.
- And they didn't try to coerce you?
- No.
- They didn't offer you money?
- Nope.
Did they ask you to contact them again?
What for?
Exactly what did they want?
The secret files.
Who had those secret files last?
You have them, Royce?
- I gave them to you.
- No.
They also suggested that Hodges and Kozinski were murdered.
Those sons of bitches!
Now, we ought to build a case and sue. This is pure harassment.
And that was it?
That was everything that was said?
Well, I mean, as far as I can remember.
It wasn't exactly a sequential conversation.
There was a lot of yelling, mostly by me.
Mitch, we're always doing battle with the government.
If it isn't the Justice Department, it's the IRS, and you know what?
We beat them every time.
And they hate us for it.
They can't get to us so they pick on somebody new.
They invite you to break the law.
Doesn't cost them anything, but it costs you everything.
Now, I don't want you to worry about this.
It's gotten serious enough.
We'll have to get into it legally.
I guess the only other question is, who do we bill this hour to?
How about the FBI?
I can't believe that.
That is so weird.
I was just thinking about you.
Somebody's burning leaves outside, did you smell it?
It reminded me of the time...
Hey!
If you're afraid you'll wake the kids, we don't have any.
Abby!
Abby!
Abby!
- Abby!
- Don't say anything! Don't say anything!
Don't tell me any more!
Everything.
Every single thing we've said or done since we've been in that house, nothing has been between us.
Can't we just get in our own car and drive back to Boston, tonight?
- We'll just leave everything.
- They'd find us.
How do you go to work tomorrow?
How do you look at Avery?
What do you say to him?
I talk about work.
- That's insane!
- I have thought of every possible way.
Here, in the Caymans, in
Washington, that's all I've done.
Try to think of a way out. if we run, they'd find us, and it gets Ray killed.
- But if you testify...
- The FBI says they'll help Ray
- and protect us.
- Protect what?
What are you going to do?
Go in tomorrow and start to copy files.
I don't have a choice.
Mitch, what are you saying?
You'll be revealing clients' secrets.
- You'll be disbarred.
- Abby, don't...
You'll never be able to practice law again for the rest of your life.
Everything you've worked for!
They can't ask you to do that!
They are not asking!
We have to behave exactly as we have been.
We have to go to work and come home every day and never wonder about the walls and the wires...
And do nothing we want to do.
Szechwan beef from Wong Boys.
That was the last time
I remember laughing.
- Come on! Every single day we got...
- Oh, not you again, man.
...one of your trucks out here, blocking this alley.
- Hey, leave me alone.
- What's it gonna take, huh?
Hey, would you leave me alone, buddy?
You're using this place as a parking lot!
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus, I was just trying to make a copy of...
They just started this. You have to have the billing code for each client.
You mean every time
I copy a piece of paper, it's recorded?
What are you trying to do, kill yourself?
Come on.
Nina should do that anyway.
Come down for one night, can't you?
Well, it used to be worth it.
Okay.
Yeah, maybe next time.
Bye, Cordelia.
That was Cordelia.
Yeah. Your wife.
From the song of the same name.
Avery, I have a couple of ideas about those Capps LCs.
When's the next Cayman trip?
For me? Next week.
If you think I'm gonna let Sonny Capps get another look at you, you're crazy.
But you write down every single thought you have.
I'll be happy to take credit.
Mr. McDeere! Mr. Mulholland's called twice about his bills again.
Tell Mr. Mulholland to take his bill and...
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Isn't he just up the street?
- Yes. In the Cotton Exchange.
- Cotton Exchange.
Tell him I'll see him later.
Did you order a fried egg sandwich from the Front Street Deli?
A fried egg...
Yes, I did. I did.
Come in.
It's $2.65.
The receipt's in the bag.
The receipt's in the bag.
How did you see them, and they didn't see you?
I was under the desk.
I was vacuuming the rug.
You want me to draw you a diagram?
I loved him.
I'm sorry, Tammy.
They wanted to know who hired him and why he was asking questions about dead lawyers.
You actually saw them?
One guy was stocky, looked like a wrestler.
He's gonna limp the rest of his life
'cause Eddie hit him in the knee with that cannon under his desk.
And the other guy was like an albino.
Long thin hair, almost white.
Dead blue eyes.
My landlady said they came looking for me yesterday, so I checked into the Motel 6 on River Street.
I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.
Listen, they're gonna put Eddie together with Ray, and when they do, it'll lead to you.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
Eddie wouldn't like it.
So, you're in as much trouble as I am.
Listen, there's a building around the corner called the Cotton Exchange.
Maybe you can help, Tammy.
Hi there, Mitch.
Bill Devasher, Firm Security.
Mr. Locke and Mr. Lambert were telling me about your little run in with the FBI.
I wonder if we could have a little talk.
Actually, I told them everything.
I'm sure you did.
This won't take a minute.
Hop in.
So, Mitch, this is a debriefing.
I know pretty much what you told the fellows, so I kind of got the picture.
Now it's my job to give you the picture.
What I'm concerned about, son, is this.
The FBI wouldn't have come after you if they didn't figure they'd get to you.
What do you suppose made them think that?
I have no idea.
Well, see, it's my job to have an idea about that.
For example, they might know how important your young wife is to you.
They might use that.
How?
Avery says last Friday you took the afternoon off.
He figures you might have been with another woman.
- Why would Avery think...
- How do you know you weren't followed?
Picture Abby one day walking to the mail box, anticipating the arrival of her Redbook, her Sharper Image catalog.
What does she find instead?
She finds heartache, Mitch.
The death of love and trust.
Imagine her one day opening that.
Go ahead.
Take a look.
Devastating.
Not just screwing, Mitch.
But the kind of intimate acts, oral and whatnot, that can be particularly hard for a trusting young wife to forgive and impossible to forget.
That's just the kind of stuff the
FBI could use for coercion, Mitch.
So you watch yourself.
I'll do the best I can to protect you, and I know you will do your best to protect the Firm.
So if the FBI so much as spits in your direction, you'll let me know before it hits the ground, won't you?
Won't you, Mitch?
Oliver wants to see you right now in the library. Where you been?
Let me just put my coat away.
Right now.
He's been waiting.
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Well, we've been informed there's somebody smarter.
You didn't get the highest score on the bar exam, you got the second-highest score.
Cheers!
Nice one.
Congratulations.
They called you, huh?
Guilty, Your Honor.
I did it.
Well, it's your moment of glory.
You know, my wife missed mine, and she never forgave herself.
I wouldn't want that to happen to you.
- That's very considerate, Avery.
- Well, I thought so.
Well done. Well done.
- Quite an achievement, Mitch.
- Abby.
Well, the space is just great.
I'll take it.
And the lease would be under...
Greenwood Secretarial Services.
And you are...
- Doris Greenwood. I like that suit a lot.
- Well, thank you.
They're gonna deliver a copier tomorrow.
- I'll make sure the office is open.
- All right.
I will employ such means only as are consistent with truth and honor.
I will employ such means only as are consistent with truth and honor.
I will maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate the secrets of my client.
I will maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate the secrets of my client.
I will truly and honestly conduct myself in the practice of my profession to the best of my skill and ability, so help me God.
"I will maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate
"the secrets of my client"?
The first thing I'm gonna do is violate the secrets of my clients.
Do you see any other way?
Okay, then. Aren't we doing the best we can?
No.
What do you mean?
I can't.
What?
That...
That night...
That night in the Caymans when you telephoned...
You were on the beach.
What?
What did you do?
No.
You didn't...
Who was she?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
I don't even know her name.
It didn't mean anything.
Like hell it didn't.
It means everything.
What did you do?
Why did you fuck some stranger on a beach one night away from me?
Who does that?
- Abby, I promise you...
- What?
You can't promise anything.
Not ever. Not anymore.
Why did you tell me?
Because I couldn't stand not to.
I couldn't stand your not knowing.
Well, now I know.
Give me the keys.
Sorry, I...
Just give me the keys.
I thought there were only two Brothers Grimm.
Sit down, Avery.
Anthony and Joey are coming down next week.
- What for?
- Works out your protégé's got a brother.
So?
He didn't mention him at the interview in Boston.
I've got a brother
I might not mention either
- in polite conversation.
- This brother's doing time.
How did you find that out?
What do you think I am here, a fucking night watchman?
I get confused sometimes.
- Well, don't!
- All right, Avery.
We got a prison guard in
Arkansas. He's on the arm.
He tells us about a Ray McDeere doing time for manslaughter.
The Moroltos have been edgy ever since the Kozinski and Hodges mess.
They're concerned that we might be misreading McDeere.
And the Moroltos are coming for what?
- To personally take over?
- Are we misreading him?
I don't think so.
Wouldn't you lie if you had a felon in the family to get a job like this?
I still think we ought to keep him on a pretty tight leash.
Why? You've got nothing to be suspicious about.
I get paid to be suspicious when
I got nothing to be suspicious about.
Excuse me.
You're not listening,
Mr. McDeere.
I'm sorry.
You were talking about hours?
Listen, I know I'm not Bendini-Lambert's most valuable client, but I've got a legitimate complaint here.
You never spent 33 hours last month on my account.
Is that what you were billed?
You don't see your own bills?
No, I just submit my time sheet.
Where is it?
It's on file with the office manager.
You know, this overbilling's gotten so common nobody gives it another thought.
It's kind of like tipping.
Well, it's not policy,
Mr. Mulholland.
It sure seems like policy. It's been going on over there for years.
People forget something else, too.
When somebody over there put a stamp on this and mailed it, you know what happened?
- It became a federal offense.
- It became a federal offense.
You're damn right.
Each instance punishable by...
$10,000 fine.
Three to five years each instance.
Nina, I'm going over to Mulholland's for a half hour or so.
All righty.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- I got the beeper.
I think there might be a way of doing this without getting disbarred and without breaking the law.
Is that our chief concern here?
Tear those up.
I might not have to use them.
But I got to get to that stuff in the Caymans.
What, for the FBI?
No. For me.
They won't let you go, you said.
Somebody's gonna have to get to it another way.
It has to happen fast.
I got to figure out what to do about Ray.
What?
In Eddie's stuff, is there some kind of wireless recording device?
Yes. Yes!
You know how to use it?
Whenever Eddie said,
"My associate"? Yours truly.
Did he have any high-speed camera equipment?
Sure.
I want you to get hold of a van, Tammy.
Hey, Tammy, did Elvis ever find out about Eddie?
Oh, man. He loved Eddie.
Are you kidding?
Hell, that stuff was over between me and Elvis when I was 18.
We'd been married two years, and one morning at breakfast
I just turned too old for him.
But I tell you, everybody loves Elvis.
The man's a panda.
And he'd do anything for me.
They're off, and Say Something comes away on top
and Right There is stepping over on the inside.
Champagne Now rushes up...
Doesn't a dog ever get the bone?
Yeah, I hear it happens once in a while.
It's a disaster.
They can never get that dog to run again.
Listen, Mitch,
Mr. Voyles wants me to tell you how much the Bureau appreciates...
A million dollars in a numbered account in Switzerland.
IBG Bank International in Zurich.
Well, you sure as hell turned greedy overnight.
And my brother out.
Now.
Your brother is a convicted felon, Mitch.
Then get yourself another snitch.
He's in for manslaughter.
It was a brawl in a bar.
If he hadn't done any boxing, it would have been self-defense.
It's still a felony, Mitch.
You heard me, Tarrance.
My brother out now.
And make it a million and a half.
How about you get down on your knees and kiss my ass for not indicting you as a co-conspirator right now, you chickenshit little Harvard cocksucker!
I haven't done anything, and you know it!
Who gives a fuck?
I'm a federal agent.
You know what that means, you low life motherfucker?
You got no rights.
Your life is mine.
I could kick your teeth down your throat, yank them out your asshole and I'm not even violating your civil rights.
- You are Agent Wayne Tarrance.
- Yeah, you're goddamn right I am!
Maybe local cops can't...
- Yeah.
- Is this Wayne Tarrance?
- Who is this?
- Is this Wayne Tarrance?
Yeah, this is Wayne Tarrance.
So is this.
...cocksucker!
I haven't done anything, and you know it!
Who gives a fuck?
I'm a federal agent.
You know what that means, you low life motherfucker?
You got no rights.
Your life is mine.
I could kick your teeth down your throat, yank them out your asshole
and I'm not even violating your civil rights.
Now,
I think you ought to reconsider.
I think I might have found a way out.
Not out, exactly.
It's more like a way through.
It's a long shot, but it's...
Well, it's legal.
I know it's weird, but if we follow the law, it just might save us.
You don't want to hear the plan.
Would it change anything between us?
It's just a plan.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't help you here.
I can't help myself.
I've given notice at the school.
I'll leave after the break Wednesday.
You're right.
It's better if you go, safer.
- You have no idea...
- Don't!
- I love you, Abby.
- Don't you dare, you son of a bitch!
You want to tell me your plan?
Tomorrow.
Abby, where are you gonna go?
To my parents, first.
After that, I don't know.
It might not be safe for you to leave, unless they know why...
I know. I know.
Somewhere inside, in the dark, a Firm is listening.
Shall we go in now and do this for the record?
I've made a decision.
My mother hasn't been well, she's having some tests.
I want to be there.
We never see each other, anyway.
And I need some time to think.
Call Devasher.
She's leaving him.
Knock, knock.
Bad times, huh?
Abby called Kay.
Listen, all the wives go a little nuts the first year.
She'll be back.
Probably want to get pregnant.
Big help, huh?
You think I'm gonna let this kid tell us how to run the penal system in this country?
Sir, it's the only way he'll give us the files.
Then stall on the money.
Get the brother out with a federal subpoena.
Follow him and the minute we get the files, yank him back.
Abanks' Dive Lodge.
Mr. Thomas Abanks, please.
This is Mitch McDeere.
Sorry, Dutch, but I've got to justify a client's bill before a breakfast meeting and all the time sheets and bills are locked up in the office manager's office.
I don't know if I'm really supposed to do this for you.
Hey, you want to wake up Avery?
I'm just trying to head off a legal action against us.
I promise, I'll have everything back in the drawer before the office opens.
You're taller than I thought.
That's nice to hear.
There's been a change of plan.
I didn't know there was a plan.
Good, because it's been changed.
Who are you, sweetheart?
Abanks' Diving Lodge.
What time has Avery chartered the boat for?
Okay, now, you got to keep him out long enough to copy everything in that closet.
Don't worry. My friends are taking him to Trinity Caves.
- It should be a good six hours.
- Okay.
Tammy's coming down tomorrow to set things up.
I can...
I can whip us up some eggs.
Last day, I don't want to be late for school.
Has Tammy left to meet Abanks?
Not until this evening.
You're running a real 3-ring circus, aren't you?
- I hope it goes well.
- It has to.
You know, isn't it amazing?
You did the cheating, and I'm the one who feels guilty.
Don't.
Take care of yourself.
Hey! Hey! Stop that!
Where are your gloves?
Get back to the dodge ball game.
You, too, Sheila.
Boys and girls together, rehearsing for later life.
What are you doing here?
Would you believe I just happened to be in the neighborhood?
No.
I heard this was your last day.
Was I misinformed?
I'll be gone for a while.
I just stopped off to say goodbye.
- Just in case.
- In case what?
In case it's more than a while.
I'm going to the Caymans tomorrow, and I would miss saying goodbye.
Well, thank you.
Have a nice trip.
Want to come?
I know.
I know, it sounds outrageous, but think about it.
We could grab some sun, take a dip, drink some Havana Club.
I could give you marital advice and hit on you, and whatever happens,
I promise I take rejection well.
What makes you think
I need marital advice?
Okay, you give me marital advice.
I couldn't possibly.
- I don't scuba dive.
- Perfect. I can't scuba dive either.
Really?
I'd heard that you don't miss a chance to...
Not this time.
I had to shorten the trip, clients coming into town.
I can't dive and fly in the same 24 hours. So, you see?
How about it?
My mother isn't well.
They're doing some tests.
That's why I'm going home.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
How could you possibly?
I hope she feels better, and if she does, bring her with you.
Goodbye, Avery.
Have a good flight.
Greenwood Secretarial Services.
Tammy, this is Abby McDeere.
I think you've got a serious problem.
Avery's not going diving.
We're dead.
Well, how do we...
How am I gonna tell Mitch?
How am I gonna let him know?
I'm going anyway.
I've got to try to do something.
My flight's in three hours.
Mr. McDeere's office.
I'm sorry, he's not in.
May I take a message?
Tammy, don't tell Mitch anything.
I'll just be a sec.
A prescription for Abigail McDeere.
One!
Well, you want to go, or do you want to stay here?
- Aren't you gonna cuff him?
- I'll take care of it.
Yeah?
Guess what I'm looking at?
Tell me.
My first sunset in six years.
- You made it.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
Lowe you, little brother.
No, you don't.
- Anything from Abanks?
- Last I heard, everything was set.
It's gonna be fine.
It already is.
I'll be seeing you, Ray.
Okay, you spoke to him.
Now, where are the files?
Where's the money?
Not until I get the files.
You send half now.
Account number 6194408S.
You got that?
Yeah. 6194408S, yeah.
When I get confirmation it's there,
I'll send the files.
Here's some pocket money.
You're free, McDeere.
There's a bus stop a quarter mile.
Follow the yellow line.
You're used to that.
Excuse me.
You don't seem that surprised.
I'm deeply surprised.
So am I.
Stephanie, could we have two Havana Club, please?
Yes, Mr. Tolar.
How'd the test turn out?
We were worried for no reason.
Good.
I didn't think we'd got on that well in the school yard.
Maybe I've grown up since then.
I'd love to believe that.
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it?
It's like cognac.
You know,
I have a very bad reputation.
- What do you do?
- I run around.
Why do you do that?
I think it's because my wife understands me.
The fact is, I love my wife.
But she's... Well,
I guess she's lost interest in me.
I know I have.
And I haven't cared for anyone since.
I'd like to, though.
I miss it.
My, you lay a lot on a girl for a first date.
Is that what this is?
This is Unit B.
We'll be pulling into Five Points at 11:15 for a 20-minute rest stop.
Mrs. Sunderland, I'm sorry to call you at home so late, but I need to speak to you about something that's, well, it's really quite embarrassing.
Let me preface this by saying you're not the only client at the Firm that I've had to call about this.
I'd like a big steak, medium rare, three fried eggs over,
French fries and coffee, please.
I'll see you, darling.
Fuck!
What the hell is going on?
We lost your brother.
Why, were you following him?
Are you trying to fuck with me?
Where are you?
Where are those files?
Are you trying to fuck with me?
You want the files, you wire the money.
I want those files now.
Got to go, Wayne.
He knows exactly where his brother is.
Have them check all the credit cards of everybody that got fuel outside that diner between 11:00 and 11:45, whenever we lost Ray.
There couldn't be more than a dozen or so.
He's got to be on one of them.
And get me a map of Louisiana.
Get me a map of Louisiana!
It hasn't even begun to melt.
The staff was chosen for its timing.
I would do that, but I could never do that.
The buttons are too small.
It requires terrible...
Dexterity.
Amazing.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
I mean, exactly what did you come here for?
I thought I was invited.
You're not being truthful.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm sick and I want you to tell me the truth.
I came here to punish Mitch for letting the Firm ruin our lives.
I came because when Mitch was here with you he slept with someone else.
Is that what you want to hear?
That's better than the alternative.
What alternative?
That you came here to see me.
Avery?
It came in about three hours ago.
You sure he'll be all right?
What the hell you want to do? Call 911?
Get the key, grab the stuff and get over here.
Keep calling him.
Wake the son of a bitch up. When you get him on the phone, find me.
I want that girl.
The account number is 6194408S.
And can you confirm that it is $750,000?
Absolutely. I'm fixing to get out of here now.
You got all the information I need?
Yeah, but, Mitch...
I've been looking at this stuff and there's no numbers listed.
There's no numbers?
No amounts?
No, I got papers for bank accounts everywhere from the Caymans to Hong Kong, but there's no amounts.
I can't play the poker game
I'm gonna play and bluff.
I gotta know how much they have and where.
There's a note on each one that says,
"Info held by client and my Mac. Signed A.T."
Is there any other information?
Is there a password?
Some kind of password?
Just look on the paper, Tammy.
Wait a minute.
On the side of one, in parenthesis it says,
"R-E-F," then a colon, then, "Cordelia."
Okay, okay, I've got to get to Avery's computer in the morning before I leave.
Well, listen, be careful.
We don't know how this is all gonna look in the morning.
I should be able to get through the morning fine.
By the time they notice I'm not back from lunch, I'll be in Chicago.
Okay. We're finished. That's it.
I gotta get these out to the boat.
The boat?
- What boat?
- Oh, man.
Later on there's some stuff I gotta tell you about what Mitch is doing.
Tell me now, Tammy.
What?
Get the damn keys back in his pants and get out of there before he wakes up.
Hello?
You have to repeat that.
That's not possible.
She stole your keys and God knows what else.
Now who the hell is she?
You know me, just somebody I met last night.
Then how the hell does she know to go after your keys?
The guys will be landing in about
10 minutes and she better be there.
Don't.
They heard you on the phone.
Mitch sent you.
I knew he was a closet idealist.
He doesn't know I'm here.
But I did do it for him.
That's even better than getting even with him.
You gotta get out of here.
What are you going to do?
Abby, the girl was a set-up.
On the beach, she was a set-up.
They do things like that.
Just in case the usual inducements don't work.
What's going to happen?
What are they going to do to you?
Whatever it is...
They did it a long time ago.
Get this thing out of here, will you?
Look, this ain't your cotton truck, and this ain't your alley!
I'm calling in to the
Department of Traffic right now!
They call?
Not yet.
Madge, I just talked to Avery in the Caymans.
He needs some work done on the Kemmer papers before 10:00.
I'll just get it off his computer.
What the hell's the matter with you guys?
This thing's out of paper.
McDeere in yet?
Check every goddamn floor and find him.
That son of a bitch cut a deal.
Natisin, Earlywine, Hemphill.
Hemphill?
Wait a minute.
That's Lomax's secretary.
Wayne, it's Warden Dynehart from Wrightsville prison.
Wayne, we've got a problem here. I've just been questioning a guard
who sent an unauthorized fax to a law firm in Memphis
and I think it was in regard to your prisoner.
No! No, no, no, no!
No, he's not in his office, Your Honor.
I'll see if he's in the building.
- Thank you, Madge.
- You're welcome.
Mitch...
We've just been looking for you.
Can you step in here, please?
Mr. Tolar's office. Yes, he's right here.
Nina, transfer him.
Mr. McDeere, a Judge Tarrance for you.
One moment please.
Hello?
Get out of there.
They know. Get out.
Did you hear what I said?
Get out of there and get over here now.
Can you?
I understand.
Come on.
He ain't going nowhere.
Rudy, get to the front door.
Mitch, what can I do you for?
Have a seat.
Okay, Rudy, he's headed east up the alley.
Get him and hold him.
God damn it.
I knew they wouldn't find her.
Now, I need him here now, so you get him back on that plane.
If we don't get McDeere before he gives what he got to the feds...
Well, what direction was he running?
- Wayne...
- Just a minute.
It's McDeere!
Where are you?
Never mind.
What happened?
Look. It's okay.
I'll send you a car.
You just come on in.
I'll tell you when you get here.
No, you tell me now!
Mitch, it was a prison guard.
You just come on in.
Come on in and we'll place you in protective custody.
Somehow you don't make me feel protected.
Are you looking to get whacked?
Do you know what's going on here?
The Moroltos are arriving today.
- From Chicago.
- What?
I got their itinerary right in front of me.
The Moroltos are coming here,
Memphis, this afternoon.
I got the itinerary right in front of me.
Northwest, arrives 2:16 p.m.
Straight to the Peabody.
Now, listen to me, the whole goddamn world is gonna be looking for you.
You can't go home, you can't go back there, so get in here. Now!
I've got to get lost for a few hours.
There's something I gotta do.
Where the hell are the files, Mitch?
You'll get instructions.
- After.
- After what?
He's withholding evidence.
He's got three quarters of a million dollars of our money.
He's a fugitive.
I want him brought in.
Use the Memphis police if you have to, but get him.
It's a red KW 10-ton registered to a Farley's Catfish Farm.
Get its routes and find that truck.
And issue APBs on Ray and Mitchell McDeere.
During the great steamboat era, which was at its height in the 1870s, these great floating palaces, like the Robert E. Lee, whose model you see here, numbered by the hundreds on the Mississippi River.
The Robert E. Lee was actually designed specifically to travel on the Mississippi River, which is a shallow river...
Follow me now to the main deck of the boat where the cargo would be carried as well as the deck passengers.
The great rollers that powered the steam engine were situated here on the main deck of the boat.
Hey, Mitch. Mitch!
The end of the great steam era and the advent of the railway.
The next gallery detailing...
We have here the working steam engine off the US Army
Corps of Engineers snag boat, the Arkansas II.
Now a steam engine works by lighting a fire underneath the boilers where the water is contained.
This heats the water and turns it into steam.
Because the kids wanted me to bring them by.
Why, what's the matter?
Okay. Oh, Lamar, I just saw
Mitch at Mud Island Museum.
He was zipping through like a tourist.
I waved to him but he didn't see me.
Northwest Airlines
Flight 264 arriving from Chicago,
Gate B-1, main concourse.
- Devasher.
- Sir, they spotted McDeere on Mud Island.
Get the boys over there, right away!
I'm on my way.
Okay. Let's get these below with the rest of them.
- Abanks' Diving Lodge.
- How are my friends?
Okay.
Your brother's on the plane and
Tammy's loading the ship now.
It worked out.
Your lawyer friend is dead.
He never was on the boat.
He canceled the charter.
- Well, how did...
- He drowned.
In his bathtub.
After the lady left.
Didn't Tammy tell you?
What lady?
- How did you get...
- I don't know.
A lady friend of Tammy's slipped him some kind of Mickey Finn.
I think it was somebody he knew.
What are you talking about?
What lady friend?
Wait a minute.
Mitch is asking about your friend Abby.
Isn't that her name?
Hey!
Excuse me.
Come here.
He's in that first door.
I'm going around the front.
You sick son of a bitch!
Well, of course I can talk.
Why, isn't that what I'm doing?
I mean, if it's something else, please advise me, Maury.
I always like to learn something
I don't know at $500 an hour.
I swear to you, Joey, every fucking lawyer on the face of the earth ought to be killed.
You want to what?
You want to meet with McDeere?
For what? So the two of you can get together and charge me $1,000 an hour while they send me to Joliet for 30 years?
Stay in Chicago, Maury.
This kid's cut a deal and I bet it's a beaut.
If I get my hands on this fucking kid,
Joey, if I get my hands on this kid...
- Excuse me.
- Not now, Ruthie.
I think it's urgent, Mr. Morolto.
Ruthie thinks it's urgent.
What do you think, Joey?
It's a Mr. McDeere.
Mr. Mitchell McDeere.
He's waiting to see you.
I think Ruth is right.
I'm Mitch McDeere.
I'm your attorney.
One of them, anyway.
I assume you knew, but I thought
I'd mention it, in case.
- Would you care to sit down?
- Not really.
I want to try and...
This is just...
This is very awkward.
I'm afraid my firm has behaved in an unethical manner.
It seems that we,
Bendini, Lambert & Locke, the entire firm, has been engaged in a...
Well, a conspiracy.
We've been overbilling our clients.
In some cases, massive overbilling.
I assure you I had no idea any of this was going on when I joined the Firm.
Well, I feel I have to report this criminal behavior.
But I can't use...
I can't use your invoices without your written authorization.
- Our invoices?
- Tony, please.
Listen.
Yes, sir. Your bills.
You see, it's an important part of the proof that we've overbilled you.
That's it?
Pretty much.
Well, most of our clients have already agreed, pretty much all.
Except for you.
Which is why I'm here.
And this is what you've been talking to the FBI about?
You want us to let you turn our bills...
What we charged you,
I should say overcharged you.
- ...over to the government.
- Yes, sir.
- Now, does that in any way...
- No, sir.
It does not in any way waive your rights to full and complete confidentiality in any other area of the attorney-client relationship.
I'm your lawyer, gentlemen.
Whether I like it or not, I can't talk to the government about you even when I'm no longer your lawyer.
That would be breaking my word, my oath.
All right, Mitch.
So what was this stealing of the files?
What the fuck was this all about?
The files haven't been stolen.
They're in exactly the same place they were.
I just felt it was important for me to be thoroughly familiar with the precise make-up and whereabouts of all your holdings and activities.
So I prepared copies of everything.
That way you and I can communicate perfectly, and, of course, if we ever have to talk to a third party, then I know everything, right down to the penny, pound, franc and deutsche mark.
I know everything you know.
As I should, as your attorney.
And what if the Firm should desire at some point to terminate your employment?
Whatever I know, wherever I go, I am bound by the attorney-client privilege.
I am very much like...
I would say I am exactly like a ship carrying a cargo that will never reach any port.
And as long as I am alive, that ship will always be at sea, so to speak.
Like Yasir-fucking-Arafat, huh?
Never a night in the same place.
In any case, I need your written authorization, so I can release your bills, like every other client has given.
You have this authorization with you?
I do.
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.
Fuck!
You got the account number?
You know how to access it?
Mitch has verified that the money's there.
I love your crooked little mouth.
Well, it's not my best feature.
Wow!
Well, what is?
Where the hell are you?
What is this supposed to be?
Huh?
- You let the Moroltos off the hook?
- They're my clients.
They're the crooks.
You're letting the Mafia get away.
- What the hell are you doing?
- You guys are always one villain behind the times, you know that?
You gave me a bunch of pencil pushers who padded their bills.
You think if they don't pull guns, they aren't the bad guys.
Ask the Moroltos who's harder to find, the killer or the lawyer who hides their money.
Don't give me that shit!
That's a bunch of double talk and you know it.
You want the Mafia?
Get their lawyers.
Without the Firm, the only way the Moroltos can launder money is in a washing machine.
You are so naive.
There'll be a thousand other
Bendini-Lamberts fighting for the chance to launder money tomorrow.
How the hell you gonna get all of them?
One at a time.
I'm a lawyer and I got mine.
You're the cop, Tarrance, you get the rest of them.
Get them with what?
Overbilling? Mail fraud?
That's exciting.
It's not sexy, but it's got teeth,
$10,000 and five years in prison.
That's 10 and five for each act.
Have you really looked at that?
You've got every partner in the Firm on overbilling.
There's 250 acts of documented mail fraud there.
That's racketeering.
That's a minimum of 1,250 years in prison and two and a half million dollars in fines.
That's more than you had on Capone.
You twist this into whatever you want.
You made a deal to save your ass.
You got our money, three quarters of a million dollars of it, you're still a hot-shot lawyer and you're out of this.
I didn't keep a nickel of your money.
It was always for somebody else.
And, yeah,
I'm still a lawyer with references from Bendini, Lambert & Locke.
You want to put that on your resume?
You think I'm ever gonna turn on the ignition in my car again without sweating?
Then I don't understand you.
What did you do it for?
You didn't win a thing.
Oh, yeah, I did. I won my life back.
You don't run me and they don't run me-.
You want to know something weird?
I discovered the law again.
You actually made me think about it.
I managed to get through three years of law school without doing that.
It's you at the dog track.
I could've gone public with it.
- Why didn't you?
- It's against the law.
Okay.
How in the hell did you ever come up with mail fraud?
It was on the bar exam.
They made me study like hell for it.
Well, you've had a busy day.
So did you.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about your plan?
All of it?
The Moroltos.
Because I knew you'd worry, and that might make you stay.
And I knew you needed to leave.
I like what you've done to the place.
- I thought you were going to your folks'.
- I was.
Some detour.
Where are you going?
To look for you.
I guess I didn't feel I could leave you without trying to help you.
Do you want to tell me what happened?
Someday.
I think you should know that Avery was pretty decent.
He was decent, and corrupt, and ruined, and so unhappy...
Listen, Abby...
And it could have happened to you, all of it.
You were on your way.
Did I lose you?
You look tired.
Did I?
I've loved you all my life.
Even before we met.
Part of it wasn't even you, it was just a promise of you.
But these last days, you kept your promise.
How could you lose me?
- You think it will make it?
- Make it where?
Boston.
What's in Boston?
We are.
And the Wong Boys, and my kids.
And a very small unknown law firm.
With a lot of potential.
Yeah.
July eighth, 1979... all the fathers of Nobel Prize winners were rounded up...
By United Nations military units, all right?
...and actually forced at gunpoint... to give semen samples in little plastic jars... which are now stored below Rockefeller
Center, underneath the ice skating rink.
I wouldn't want to be there for the thaw. Ha-ha-ha. Yuck.
I mean, it's disgusting!
You know what they put in the water, don't you?
Fluoride! Yeah, fluoride.
On the pretext that it strengthens your teeth!
That's ridiculous! You know what this stuff does to you?
It actually weakens your will... takes away the capacity for free and creative thought... and makes you a slave to the state.
Ever wonder about all these militia groups, survivalist-type kooks on the right-wing side?
They say that they're defending the country from the U.N. troops.
These guys yelling so loud, my theory is... And this is a conspiracy, pal.
They are the U.N. troops.
They're in place!
The infrastructure's ready.
It's a fait accompli.
They'll just take over.
We'll all be toast.
Oswald. Yeah, that's what I said, Oswald.
He said, "I'm just a patsy."
That means he didn't do it, right?
Armand Hammer goes to the doctor.
The doctor says, "Hey, Armand..." you've only got 3 minutes to live."
And he says, "Oh, God, that's terrible news."
Isn't there anything you can do for me, doc? Three minutes?"
And the doctor says,
"Well, I can boil you an egg."
I guess not. All right.
Do you ever see those advertisements, like, "Got Milk?"
Hey, Open up! Open it up!
What's going on in there?
Open it up.
Son of a bitch!
"Eat beef"?
That's like saying, "Smoke cigarettes," or "Drive cars." I mean, it's real generic.
This guy looks at me and says, "You think you're living in a free country?"
"You think it's a democracy?
Of course it's not."
Web sites, newsletters, self-published manifestos.
They think we're kooks.
George Bush knew what he was saying when he said, "New World Order."
You remember those three little words?
He was a 33rd degree Mason, you know, and as ex-director of the CIA... he knew that saying that would send conspiratologists everywhere... spinning, spinning their wheels.
Then they destroy their own credibility.
Don't get me wrong, sister, I'm sure your heart's in the right place... but, you know, somebody's got to lift the festering scab that is the Vatican.
A chip for identification so they can track down an animal anywhere he's at.
You'll insert it under the dog's skin and it's an identification thing.
I mean, it's only a small logical step... until they start putting it in us and our children. Before we know it... they'll probably come with the pretext...
Sure. Hey, is that one of the new hundreds where they changed picture of Ben Franklin?
Look at him. He looks like... the love child of Fred
Mertz and Rosie O'Donnell.
Yeah, that's him. Get rid of them as soon as you can, lady.
Look at it. See the metal strip in it?
That's a tracking device.
If you got any more of those at home, get rid of them. Exchange them.
They'll follow you. They know where every one of those hundreds is going...
Black helicopters. You heard about them? The black helicopters?
They're... They're everywhere.
They're on whisper mode. You can't hear them until they've already gone.
You know?
No. There's nobody there.
Where did...? Where did they...?
Where'd they go? Oh, there was nobody in here! Nobody.
What am I talking...?
Why is the meter on?
Taxi!
Taxi!
- Where to, pal?
- Luxembourg Towers, on 7th.
Okay.
The sound of love.
Excuse me?
That, what you just did.
- That's love.
- Heh.
"Love is just a way of saying,
"I want to sleep with you."
Admit it. I saw you kiss her.
You love her. This is the street where love lives.
Love is bullshit.
Love gives you wings.
It makes you fly.
I don't even call it love.
I call it "Geronimo."
- Geronimo?
- Yeah.
Geronimo. See, when you're in love, you'll... jump right from the top of the
Empire State and you won't care.
Screaming "Geronimo" the whole way down. It's great.
Yeah, but then you'll die. You'll squash yourself. So, what's the point?
Hey, aren't you listening? I'm telling you, love gives you wings.
She must be some girl.
I love her so bad, I just...
Well, she wrecks me.
I'd die for her.
She feel the same about you?
I don't know.
Uh, I never told her.
Why the hell not?
Uh...
I have some problems.
- You dumb creep!
- Oh, my God!
Stop the cab!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shut up! Wacko!
- I'm sorry.
Forget the fare.
Love Street.
Yeah, sure, it's possible Lee
Harvey Oswald didn't kill Kennedy.
And frankly, it's possible Jack Ruby...
didn't kill Oswald. Look at those films, you see this other guy hanging around.
Are you saying that
Oswald is still alive?
Well, no. Somebody who looked like Lee Harvey Oswald.
She's singing.
Can't take my eyes off of you
Bingo.
I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
Through all the lonely night
I love you, baby
Trust in my when I say
Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Pretty baby
Now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
Why do you do that?
Why do you push yourself?
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
Whoa!
- Yo, brother!
- What are you doing?
Go ahead, play on.
Hey, what's up?
Ha-ha-ha! Look at him.
Come on, keep up! Keep UP!
- Can you swim, man?
- Ha-ha-ha!
The water main broke all the way up on 40th Street and 7th Avenue.
- Yeah?
- They say the subway's a damn river.
Strange.
What's up, Jerry?
What are you thinking?
Water mains don't usually break unless it's wintertime.
The pipes burst open because it's cold.
And it's only the first of October.
- Reminds me of life in the delta.
- Yeah, Mississippi, all right.
- Mekong, my friend. Mekong.
- Oh.
Hey, Flip, did I ever tell you that the whole Vietnam War... was fought over a bet... that Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onassis?
I heard that. The two of them used my legs for a wishbone.
Nearly snapped my butt in half.
- Yeah, they owe you.
- No, you owe me!
- Ah. Uh, I'll get you tomorrow.
- All right.
- Peace.
- You too! Take it easy, Flip.
Ho! Ho! All right, all right. Yeah!
Seventy-three, 74... seventy-five, 76, 77, 78... seventy-nine, 80, 81.
Okay, right.
Not bad, 1:31.
Good, good. I can do that a couple more times.
Maybe four times if I have to.
Somebody's growing a garden on the roof. Ripe for the picking.
Yeah, that's it. Health food.
That's disgusting! What is that?
You really don't need it.
I didn't leave this open.
Somebody's been up here. Oh, I'm not the only one with a key.
Right where I left you.
Yuck. Return to sender.
Disgusting.
- Jerry, keys.
- What? What?
How come this is safe for me, but not for the keys?
- Smart girl.
- How's that, Jer?
Justice. She's wearing a blindfold.
- Jerry.
- What?
- You have an appointment?
- Sure, naturally.
- Okay, can you show us a slip?
- I'm not wearing one. Ha-ha-ha!
- Good morning, Claudia.
- Good morning, sir. This is what you wanted.
- And, uh, your coffee's on your desk.
- Okay, thank you.
People, give me this room.
Not you, Miss Sutton. You stay.
This is a request from you for 18 wiretaps... on the Ezekiel Walters case, a case that we are no longer investigating.
I've been doing it in my spare time.
This is the Justice Department, not Alice Sutton, P.I.
Walters is sewing a life sentence on the bank bombing.
Until we get new evidence, this case is closed.
Do you know what it's like, Mr. Wilson, to think you know what happened... but to never be sure?
I've been here 20 years, Alice.
I know what it's like.
Until you've investigated your own father's murder, you have no idea.
Alice Sutton knows me.
- It will not be a surprise.
- You're making it hard.
Ms. Sutton's psychotic is here again.
Claudia, I want him out of here right now.
I have a right!
I am an American citizen!
- And I demand to see Alice Sutton!
- Please, you have to...
Shit.
Man, this guy is a restraining order waiting to happen.
I... Can I see Alice Sutton?
No, he can't. He has to have an appointment.
I have a right to be here.
She'll tell you that.
- Get him out of here.
- Thank you.
What? She can't... I haven't done anything wrong!
Officers! Officers,
I'll take him from here.
I'm Alice Sutton. Sorry.
Hi, Alice.
You need to start making appointments.
Uh, can I make one now? In a couple minutes? I can wait if you're busy.
Come around.
- I don't see the connection.
- You don't?
Oh, come on. Six major earthquakes in three and a half years and the space shuttle... up in orbit for every one. Don't you think that's strange?
Testing some top-secret seismic weapon?
No! No. Not testing. Using.
Nukes are passe. We're...
We're talking weapon of the future.
I don't see what it has to do with the president.
The president's in Europe...
Hi. Europe at the moment.
And, uh, tomorrow he'll be, uh... in Turkey, right here along this fault line.
And they sent up a space shuttle yesterday.
- Motive?
- Motive?
How about $50 billion?
How's that for a motive?
Oh. Oh, here, let me get that.
The president's cutting funding to NASA, the milk cow of the aerospace industry.
So you're telling me that NASA's going to kill the president with an earthquake?
- Do you still ride?
- Not for years.
Why do you keep the picture of you?
Kind of wish you hadn't quit?
- Jerry. The earthquake.
- What? Oh.
Not exactly the kind of thing... a Secret Service agent can just throw himself on top of, is it?
- Mr. Wilson needs you in his office.
- Thank you.
Does she always just burst in like that?
Yes, Jerry, that's her job.
Now I have to go.
My boss is looking to yell at me.
Do you want me to talk to him, smooth things out for you?
No, I want you to go home or wherever it is that you go.
And I want you to make an appointment.
You can't just keep bursting in.
No, no. It's just what they'd be expecting.
- If I make an appointment, they...
- Jerry.
I have a serious job here.
I have a boss I must answer to.
Do you understand that?
I'm sorry. You're right.
- Use your common sense.
- Okay.
Okay, deal. So are you gonna warn him?
Who?
The president.
I'm not gonna promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
She thinks I'm crazy.
No. No, Jerry, I think you're different.
Well, you know, to be normal in the real world... and to, you know, drink
Coca-Cola and eat...
- Jerry.
- Sorry. Eat Kentucky Fried Chicken... you got to be in a conspiracy against yourself.
Do you wanna go out sometime?
No.
Okay. Okay. Ahem.
So, what's...? What's your horse's name?
Johnny Dancer.
You've been in my office a dozen times, you never asked that before.
Um, I was waiting till
I got to know you better.
- Ahem, uh...
- Ahem.
I'd say eight, actually... times.
Times I've been here. Eight.
Hey! Hey, pal!
Don't these water mains usually go in the wintertime?
Hey, pal, all I know is it's beaucoup overtime.
Yeah.
Feds.
No, not Feds.
These guys got a purpose.
Car has government plates.
Government plates.
There's something fishy going on here.
Yeah. Yeah. Bet my balls.
Oh, here they come. Camera!
Sir, he's in the building now.
Spooks. I knew it.
Yes, sir.
Surprise must count for something.
You guys are good.
You fellas been watching me a while?
I've been told I have eyes in the back of my head... but I didn't even see you guys coming, you know? I just...
You must be spooks, huh? Spooks?
CIA spooks, right?
Say something, will you?
I was right.
What was...?
What was I right about?
I wasn't right about... No, I wasn't right.
I was wrong. I was wrong! I was...
You guys are from NASA! That's right!
You're from NASA! No! Come on!
No, not the eyes!
God! Unh!
What?
We've been looking for you a long time, Jerry.
Do I know you?
Very well.
Jerry... have you ever... been in a place from which hope was gone?
Where all that's left... is patience?
Now, Jerry... to whom have you been talking?
I... I... I talk to lots of people.
I drive a cab, you know?
- I meet people all day.
- Who else knows what we know?
What?
What we know, Jerry.
What?
Tell me what! What do we know?
If I know what we know, then
I could tell you what we know... and if someone else knows, okay?
I mean, it's just...
You got to be more specific.
What...? What is that?
Gravy for the brain.
No! Not gravy!
Please! Please! Please!
Not gravy. No, not gravy!
No! God, no.
Don't do this to me, please!
Now, Jerry... to whom have you been talking?
No, I've had gravy!
I've had gravy.
- I know you!
- Yes. Now you...
- You know now, Jerry. Now you know.
- Unh!
- I don't know! Help me!
- Who else knows, Jerry?
Who else knows, Jerry?
- Who knows?
- Help me!
What do you know? Who have you been talking to?
Help! Help!
I know I must share some of the blame for this.
I wish it didn't have to be this way.
Jerry, to whom have you been talking?
Who else knows? Who else knows?
Jerry!
I believe.
I believe! I believe!
Agh!
- Who else knows?
- I don't know.
Who else knows, Jerry?
- Names, Jerry, names!
- I don't know!
- I don't want to dance!
- Who else knows?
To whom have you been talking?
Aah! Aah! Now he knows!
Now he knows!
He's flying! He's flying!
You wouldn't do this if you knew! Alice!
I want to see Alice Sutton!
There she is.
There she is. Alice! Alice!
I don't know...
Alice, this is it! This is it!
They tried to...
I don't know what they tried, but I know...
I don't know what I know, but I know that it's big.
And they just... Will you let me talk?
Look, get back, all right?
- Calm down!
- Cut it out, will you?
Get back. Please, just give me that gun.
- And roll it over here.
- All right, all right!
- Will you get back? Will you get back? Alice.
- All right.
- I need to talk to you.
- You want to talk to me? Here I am.
- I was... In a wheelchair... No, I was...
- Take it easy. Okay.
- Will you get back!
- Okay.
Alice, I have to tell you something. I...
Why don't you just take it easy?
Take it real easy with that, okay?
Just take it real easy.
Jerry, you have blood on your shirt.
Oh.
I bit his nose off!
I bit his nose off! I bit...
- You bit somebody's nose off?
- Agh.
Don't get into this thing where you make me repeat myself. I hate that.
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- Get back... you dumb complicit sons of bitches!
You're looking for a man with no nose, not me! Not me.
- I need to tell you there was...
- Jerry, look at me.
Tank. Fishtank. Goldfish, no.
- And I was in the belly of a whale.
- Just calm down.
No! Wheel...! I was crippled and...
Look at me. I want you to put the gun down, please.
No, there was a goldfish. There wasn't any gravy and I...
- Jerry. Jerry.
- I...
I don't know what to...
Just put the gun down.
I'm so... I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay? Perfect.
- Agh!
- Hey! Take it easy! Take it easy!
- Unh!
- Jesus. My God, Jerry, you're bleeding.
Call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance!
A piece of a wheelchair poked through me.
- Christ.
- Back away! Back away!
Put it away!
- Oh, Christ!
- Tell me what happened.
I can't.
I can't remember.
I can't remember them.
I can't remember me.
I... I can remember you.
I remember you.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I'll remember in the morning. Remem...
I'm just tired.
I just need some sleep.
Open.
Open, please.
She's for you.
No, nurse. No, don't! Don't!
What is it? What is it?
I told them...
- No, what is it?
- Something to help you sleep.
I don't... Agh! I don't want to sleep, I want to check out.
Why am I handcuffed to this bed?
I'm not a criminal. Please, help!
Alice, you gotta get me out of here.
They gave me some stuff.
- You're under arrest.
- What?
What's...? What's the charge?
- Jerry, you were there. Figure it out.
- Oh, Jesus.
If you remember who stabbed you with the wheelchair...
- ...or where it happened, it would help.
- Wheelchair, right.
I was in the... Oh, God, I wish I could explain it so it all made sense.
- It's all right. Just relax.
- Alice. Alice.
You got to switch the charts.
Switch my charts with that guy's charts. You gotta switch them.
Don't make me repeat myself. Please, switch my chart or I'll be dead by morning.
- I swear.
- Relax. Go to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.
- You want to bet?
- You're just being paranoid.
Only paranoid because they want me dead.
Please, Alice.
Please, save my life.
Switch... Switch them.
Switch the charts.
Could you open this, please, ma'am? Ma'am?
- What happened?
- Guy came in with a stab wound... and died of a heart attack.
Go figure.
- You Miss Sutton?
- Yes.
They want me to bring you downstairs.
Who does?
The FBI, the CIA. You name the initials, they're down there.
Any special reason?
They said to bring you and the body to the basement.
And the body's on its way, so come with me.
Uh...
I just need one minute, please.
Thank you.
For what?
For switching the charts.
I didn't switch the charts.
No, it's okay. The guy, he traded bullets with an old man in a liquor store.
He had it coming.
You expect me to believe that someone came in here last night... and gave that guy something that stopped his heart?
You switched the charts, you tell me.
I've got to go downstairs, now.
- The CIA wants to see your body.
- Really?
I won't be here when you get back. I'll keep in touch.
You're handcuffed to the bed, Jerry.
I guess I'll have to chew through my arm.
It's better than hospital food.
Thank you.
You saved my life. Thank you.
Heart attacks happen.
I didn't switch the charts.
Yeah, you did.
You switched them.
You switched the charts.
Let's see here. This is a grueling experience.
Put that out!
Here's a government man now.
Uh, this is Miss Sutton.
Miss Sutton, Agent Lowry, FBI.
Uh, we're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared.
- This guy Fletcher's something else.
- Tell me about it.
Police want him for assault.
Secret Service for counterfeiting.
We're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.
No one knows what the
CIA wants him for.
This guy's a CIA shrink, he's here to ID Fletcher.
- They knew each other somehow.
- Take off the sheet.
- This isn't him.
- Says "Jerry Fletcher" on the chart.
- Alice.
- Uh...
Uh, Jerry's...
- He's...
- He's what?
He's having a heart attack!
- Where's that goddamn cop?
- Agh! Unh!
Get a crash cart in here, stat!
Dr. Hamilton, Code Blue.
Dr. Hamilton, Code Blue.
- A dog bit it.
- Excuse me?
You were going to ask about my nose.
Poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
- And you feel bad for it?
- It's my dog.
Oh, no! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Nurse. Nurse! Aah!
There he goes!
- Open the goddamn gate!
- No, and you watch your language!
- Hey!
- FBI, lady! Open the damn door!
Hi, Alice.
You never saw me.
Shut up! There he goes!
Lady, open the damn door!
- Open the gate! Will you open it?
- Open it!
You! Get hospital security.
- Block all exits.
- Yes sir. Let's go!
Is this guy a psychiatrist or a field agent?
You want to put your foot down and get out of there?
Ugh. Come on, buddy.
Look, if you only knew what really happened to Serpico... you'd be helping me out right now.
Get out of there!
Come on, now!
Give me a break. I'm wounded.
Hands behind your back.
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Agh! Unh.
He said a dog bit his nose.
Oh. Arf.
Please. You got to help me out of this, Alice, please.
I can't make any promises.
I'm in a tight spot here.
Please, Alice.
You look really pretty today.
Your eyes look kind of different. Oh, God.
Please, Alice, make an exception. Alice?
Alice. Alice. Alice. Alice!
Please. Alice, are you there? Please!
Come back. Please, don't leave me here.
Alice. Alice. Alice!
Oh, unh.
Thank you.
There we go.
Have you seen him?
- No. Did you see him?
- No way we can shut a place quick enough.
You have a half-naked man chained to a bed rail. Just block all the exits.
- That's a good idea.
- Um...
Will you keep me company, please?
- David?
- Uh, Carl.
I'm sorry, Carl. Of course. Dr. Fine.
I want your advice about something.
I had a middle-aged guy, operating on him, gallstones...
- Do I know you?
- Of course. Dr. Fine, Proctology.
So Jerry thinks that NASA is plotting to kill the president?
You've already asked me that.
And you have no idea where Jerry lives?
You've asked me that three times. Why do you keep making me repeat myself?
All right, here's a fresh one.
Over here.
Why you?
Your colleague, Mr. Wilson, tells me
Jerry won't talk to anyone but you.
That seems, um... oddly possessive behavior to me.
I'm sorry, what was the question?
Why do you insist on having me repeat myself?
Why... you?
I think he has a crush on me.
How charming.
He has great taste.
Now, why him?
Why do you, uh, tolerate his visits to your office?
About six months ago, I was leaving work and two guys tried to mug me.
Jerry came out of nowhere and rescued me. That's how I met him.
He probably is crazy, but there's something about Jerry that... just...
I don't know.
I guess I don't have the heart to tell him to get lost.
I didn't know the CIA had psychiatrists.
We're very specialized.
May I?
Veritas.
Truth.
What is it they say about truth?
The truth will set you free.
Thank you.
"Catcher in the Rye."
That's the book Chapman had on him when he shot John Lennon.
I was just thinking that.
Remember the guy that shot Reagan? John Hinckley?
I read they found a copy of that book in his apartment.
Weird coincidence, huh?
Thanks for your input, officer.
Unh. Gum... keys... and a book.
Hmm.
Car.
Maybe apartment.
But, uh... this in an odd one.
What do you think?
It's got paint on it.
Safety deposit box key.
I'll take that.
And that.
You're welcome.
Spooks.
So, what do you say we, um...
I don't know, compare notes on this guy?
"Geronimo"?
- No, don't! Don't!
- Let me have the ticket.
No, I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here! Oh, God.
- There's a "no parking" sign there.
- Yeah, I see it. Yeah, yeah.
- Two cops to give a ticket now? Great.
- These days it takes two cops.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Tickets have been coming all day.
Didn't know what to do.
- How'd you know this was my car?
- I didn't. It was a lucky guess.
Look, I feel kind of naked.
Could we get out of here?
- Please don't tell me you're naked.
- It's a figure of speech. Can we go?
- Please. Hurry.
- Yeah, okay.
People are looking everywhere for the...
What took you so long?
I was here all day.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside-out. There are people after you.
They'll put me in the same place as
Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone.
Oswald killed the president. Is that what you're planning to do?
No. Did you call him about the earthquake thing?
- Warn him?
- I'll do that.
- Can you sit up so I can see you?
- No. No. I don't want them to see me.
- Them who?
- Them back there.
Look. Change lanes.
Watch the rear-view mirror.
It's a fun experiment.
- Did you see it? Wraparound headlights?
- Yeah.
Crown Victoria? FBI.
It's a legitimate tail.
As opposed to?
As opposed to people more serious about their work.
Can you drive this thing, or do you just like looking good in it?
I suppose you think
I should speed up...
- ...and try to lose them?
- Yes.
It's what a man would do.
I'm not a man.
I noticed. Hey, what...?
What are you doing?
What are you doing? What?
What are you doing?
Oh, man.
Agent Lowry.
It wasn't my idea.
Jonas?
It's his show for now.
Look, you want to get some dinner?
Interagency cooperation and all?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
It's your call.
Have a good night.
See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Nothing's easy.
- You know that guy they arrested in...
- How long have we known each other?
Six months and 11 days. Um...
Six months and 11 days?
All right, I'll give you one more hour.
Where to?
Why did we have to go down to go back up?
Shh, shh, shh.
Because...
Because it's, uh... I don't like to come and go the same way twice.
I just live in there.
I have to get...
Get... Unh.
Okay.
Here.
- You should have this.
- What is it?
It's my union pin. I figured, the way you drove... you should be in the union.
I'd be proud to have you drive me around in a cab.
Come in, please.
Give me those.
I'll put them up. Unh.
Let me shut the door. Sorry there's not more room in here.
My keys.
I'll just get the light.
The Jerry Garcia file.
I didn't... Oh, yeah. Yes, I did.
You know why The Grateful
Dead are always on tour?
- No.
- Yeah?
You know why? Because they're all
British agents, intelligence agents.
They're spies.
Jerry Garcia himself has a double-0 rating, just like James Bond.
Jerry Garcia's dead.
That's what they want you to think. Unh.
Is this supposed to protect you from aliens or something?
No, it's just a beer bottle.
Follow me.
Come into my humble abode.
Here we go.
Welcome.
Would you like something to drink?
Coffee... if that's okay.
Oh, no, coffee's our friend.
Coffee's our friend. It's fine.
I keep the beans in the fridge. Keeps them fresher, makes better coffee.
Old Italian guy, Papa
Leoni told me that.
He's dead now. Nice old guy.
The hell?
"I love the delicate shadow..." of she...
- "wanting me to be."
- Gah, uh...
Yeah, I can't seem to remember this combination. Want some juice instead?
Sure.
Oh, you know, if my universe had a hub...
- This would be it?
- Yeah.
Here.
"In the Irons"?
Yeah, I've been reading up on it lately. Equitation.
- You know.
- Are these yours?
Yes.
But this, I think this is what's been causing the problem.
This is the third issue this year.
"Conspiracy Theory." I give you "Conspiracy Theory."
This is my newsletter.
I think it's got them scared.
You know? I must have hit a nerve with one of those articles in there.
Otherwise... They're pretty pissed off about something. That's...
"The Space Shuttle's
Seismic Secret"?
"The Oliver Stone-George Bush
Connection"? Oliver Stone?
Oh, oh yeah. Sure. I mean, he's their spokesman.
Yeah! You think if anyone had the information that he's got... and had a national podium to shout it from, they'd actually let him do it?
No, it's quite clear that he's a disinformation junkie for him.
The fact that he's still alive says it all. He should be dead.
- Can you prove any of this?
- Heh.
No. Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is, um, an unprovable one.
If you can prove it, they screwed up somewhere along the line.
- And if that's the case...
- They?
They! Yeah.
- They who?
- They?
They? I... I don't know.
That's why they call them "they."
And "them." You know?
Where does Jonas fit in?
He's one of "they." He's one of them.
He's them. I mean, for sure.
- They. Them.
- Them.
Suppose they have a secret handshake.
- That's it?
- Ha, ha.
No. How would I know?
I'm not one of them.
I'm just horsing around.
- How many subscribers do you have?
- Well, let's see.
Uh, five.
But I think it's probably got something to do with the economy.
You think one of them is not who they seem?
You think it might be one of they?
That could be. Oh! Of course!
- You have a list?
- Huh?
- A subscriber's list?
- Oh!
Yes, right over here.
I thought you meant some other kind of...
Big Holden Caulfield fan?
No.
Not really.
You just like the story?
- Not especially, no.
- Well, Jerry... you've got a dozen copies of this book.
I know.
Yeah, I know. I know, I...
There's more of them in here.
And, uh...
Under the bed too.
I don't know why, but whenever I see one...
I have to buy it.
And if I don't see one... well, then I have to find one... to buy... so that I can feel normal.
I... I don't know why. Ahem.
Did you ever read it?
Um, yeah, you read this in school.
No one ever gave it to me to read at school.
That's what they start when you're young.
When you're little, at school, they
Baden-Powell all the boys and... and they Betty Crocker all the girls.
Then they air condition you.
And they put you in an Easy Bake
Oven and you can't breathe anymore.
Oh, Jesus.
You must think I'm crazy, huh?
Yeah, right.
Four, twenty-three... twelve.
That's, uh...
That's the combination of the coffee.
Do you still want some?
Ugh, you idiot.
We're made. Gas them.
Go! Tear gas!
Don't breathe! Don't breathe!
- Delta team, are you secure?
- Delta team, secure.
- Ready?
- Take it down!
Concussion grenade. Clear!
- Get on the bed! Stay down!
- Aah!
Unh! Move it! Come on! Come on.
- What are you doing? Oh, God.
- Get down. There's a ladder.
- Are you coming?
- I'm right behind you.
- Close your eyes.
- Aah! What are you doing?
I'm torching my hub!
What is that?
Uh, that was here when I moved in.
- What are you doing?
- Always be prepared.
Get out now! Go, go, go!
The fire's two flights up on the left.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Clear a path.
- Was that who I think it was?
- Yup.
- Has this ever happened before?
- No.
- No, but I've been practicing. Let's go.
- Jerry!
- What?
- Who are you?
I'm just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Come on, let's go.
See this aluminum-looking stuff? It's fire wall.
It's amazing. The guy designed this place so it could be an incinerator... but it leaves the rest of the building untouched.
Dr. Jonas. Dr. Jonas!
Something else here you should see.
I want to hear more.
Let's go. Wrap it up. Let's go.
Do you mind?
In one hour, I want to know what she eats... where she sleeps, the name of her kindergarten teacher. Everything.
- See? Home, safe and sound.
- No, it only looks safe.
- You can't stay here.
- They're not after me!
Don't turn the lights on.
Look, I can stay here with you,
I can sleep on your couch.
- Don't turn the lights on.
- No. You're going, okay?
- I don't want to go.
- No. You're going!
I want to ask you something.
Ask me to stay. I could sleep in the bathtub.
- Jerry, no! Shut up.
- You shouldn't be here alone.
- Get down.
- Jerry, I...
What are you doing now?
You don't want to be seen here.
Always make sure these are shut.
Please, just be still, be quiet.
Listen to me, okay?
I think we can make some progress... if you just answer one question to my satisfaction.
I'll try.
It's about the painting on the wall in your apartment.
I didn't mean for you to see that.
That's like looking in someone's diary...
- and taking it all out of context, you know.
- Okay. Okay.
That's fair. It's just that... well, Jerry, it was so big and you obviously put a lot of time into it and you seem to... know me so well.
How is that possible?
So, what's the question?
How is that possible?
This is you and your dad. He was... murdered, wasn't he? He was that judge. I read in the paper.
Did they ever find out, you know... how, who did it?
You don't mind me asking you?
I mean, it's...
You're changing the subject.
He's why you punish yourself, isn't it?
Jerry, please, don't start.
You get on the treadmill, and turn your back to that picture... like you're running away from him.
You punish yourself. Sometimes you sing along to the music... but most of the time, you punish yourself. Wow.
I don't know where you get the energy after a full day's work.
- You run like a maniac. I wondered why.
- What are you talking about? Music?
What are you talking about, huh?
Are you watching me?
What do you do? Sit in your car?
Are you waiting in an alleyway? Every day?
- It's not like...
- What is it? Tell me what it is!
- You don't ride your horse...
- Do not change the subject!
Get out of my house. Now!
I will give you $100 to get out of my house.
I don't need any money.
I got plenty for a rainy day.
Oh, yeah? Well guess what?
- It's pouring out.
- All right, you're tired. I, uh...
Just don't be mad at me, okay?
Use your dead bolts, Alice.
Dead bolts. Okay? Just lock up.
I'm gonna empty my bladder.
- How's your bladder?
- I gotta go. How's yours? Hey!
No, no. No, don't do that.
Okay.
There's a lot of folks looking for you.
I guess that makes you the smart one, huh?
Put your hands on the wheel.
Both your hands on the wheel. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Don't mention it.
- Where's my partner?
- Who? Oh!
I... He's okay.
But here you are with a gun to your head asking how your partner is.
You might be okay. Um...
He'll have a headache for a couple of days.
Are your intentions here honorable?
I'm not sure what you mean.
Uh, they...? Uh, with Alice.
I mean, what...?
Think of me as her guardian angel.
That's ironic because we're here to protect her from you.
No, you're here because you thought
I'd show up, so that's why you're here.
- Seemed like a possibility.
- Well...
What about your intentions?
Are they, uh...
- ...honorable?
- Uh.
Yeah.
I'm not a violent man.
No, I'm not by nature.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry.
But if you hurt Alice in any way... or anything like that,
I'll kill you.
Does that seem honorable enough?
Well, um, maybe.
Are you pretending?
Yes, yes...
Sorry.
It's got to be here.
Thank God.
- May I help you, sir?
- Yeah.
Okay. Uh...
- I need to scan it.
- All right, put it through.
No, this side.
Okay, just... I'll do it.
I'll do it. Just...
Bingo! "Catcher in the Rye."
Location is 33 East 17th
Street, Barnes and Noble.
Where's...?
- I'm just putting it in a bag, sir.
- I don't want a bag.
- I got the exact change for you.
- Okay.
Make life easy for you.
- Your receipt.
- Yeah. Thank you.
You're welcome.
"Catcher in the Rye."
- Yeah.
- It's a classic.
- Have you read it?
- You know, I've...
- ...never read it.
- Never?
No, I haven't. I never read it.
We're going silent, guys.
Confirm silent.
Exploit the art
And watch hip-hop fall apart
But I'm a do my part to stay true but please don't try to tell me what I can not see
Could I have a pretzel?
And expect all props
I'm gettin' dropped like hot rocks
So stop what they doin'
'Cause I'm about to ruin
I got him.
There he is.
Just one.
Hurry up.
Sorry.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
Bomb! There's a bomb under my seat!
Be calm! Remain calm and move out in an orderly fashion!
There he is!
I'm not sorry.
Leave me alone, will you?
I'm turning into a Jerry.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters related to Jerry Fletcher.
We are not to discuss him with the press, N.Y.P.D., or anyone else.
Building security is gonna arrest him on sight... and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
I don't like it. Something's not right here.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.
Why is that?
Well, we don't know who Dr. Jonas is.
We don't know who we're cooperating with.
I had a lot of credentials flashed in my face.
And after yesterday,
I know not to ask questions.
We're out. We're shut off.
We're terminated.
Understood?
Understood.
They can't see the trees for the forest.
Hello?
Hi, may I speak with
Mr. Ketcham, please?
This is Mrs. Ketcham.
Hello, Mrs. Ketcham. Your husband receives our newsletter.
I wanted to see if he would like to renew his subscription?
My husband is dead. He was killed last night in a car accident.
- Miss Sutton here?
- Yes.
Sign here, please.
- Hey, here, wait.
- Thank you.
These just came for you.
- Want a vase?
- Yes, please.
"Go out the building to the right.
Take the first bus."
Claudia, tell Jill I'm expecting a call from Milwaukee.
Transfer the calls to my mobile.
- Will do.
- Thank you.
Got her.
Subject is on the move.
Okay, she's on the bus. Go!
Subject on bus 1648.
Will follow.
What the hell?
Keep going!
Ha-ha-ha! Like a Roadrunner cartoon. See that?
- No, see what?
- You didn't see it?
- Nobody ever sees what I see.
- Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
- What?
- Where did you get your five subscribers?
I put an ad on the computer bulletin board.
Logged in at the library so they couldn't trace it.
They're dead.
Four out of five of them.
I've checked. All in the last 24 hours.
One accident, two heart attacks, a stroke.
This one I can't reach.
Henry Finch.
They're dead. Dead.
I did that.
Heart attacks and strokes, that's CIA. Henry Finch!
Oh, my God!
I should've realized.
They monitor absolutely everything.
Elaborate on "they." They?
They?
There's lots of groups, actually.
Lots of initials.
CIA. FBI. IMF, you name it.
They. But they're part of the same two opposing factions.
- Which are?
- Which are, one...
One. Some of them are really, really wealthy families.
Their thing is to maintain stability.
That's what they call it.
The other is Eisenhower's industrial-military complex.
And they want instability, so they say.
So you're saying that group one is warring with group two?
Yes, at some levels. But at others, it's the same group.
It's scary! It's hand and glove.
Cold wars, hot wars.
- They sit back and watch the whole damn show.
- Jerry. Take a breath.
The latest casualty in the whole fiasco is one of the richest men in America:
Ernest Harriman.
He was murdered.
- Murdered?
- Here in Manhattan.
No, Jerry, I read in the paper, he was, um...
He drowned in a swimming pool. It was an accident, it was in Newport.
No. Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't even kill Sunny Von Bulow in Newport.
He drowned, but not in Newport.
Where, then?
Right here, the 7th
Street subway station.
A billionaire waiting on the subway?
Why didn't they drown him in his limo?
No, don't you read the papers?
I mean, don't you watch television? Huh?
Last week, this place was under water.
- A water main broke.
- I know.
But you know what's right above this area? The Harriman Building.
The whole substructure was flooded.
I'm telling you, he didn't drown in a pool.
Call the, uh, coroner in Rhode
Island or wherever it was... and ask if he had chlorinated water in his lungs.
- Okay, I will.
- You will?
Yeah, if you want, I will.
I don't know what to say.
I love you.
- What?
- I...
I...
It's like I resolved to... call you up a thousand times a day.
And, um, ask you if you'll marry me... in some old-fashioned way.
Everything you do is magic.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Yeah, I know. I know that.
Uh, I know that. Look.
I'm nervous. I reached out and grabbed hold of the first thing I could think.
I know they're song lyrics.
- But I know how I feel.
- Jerry.
I think you're confused.
It's been a long day.
I'm not confused. I'm not. You wanted to know, that picture on the wall.
- How that was possible.
- I don't think we should...
Yes, we should. It's Geronimo.
That's love. And love gives you insight.
Love lets you see things that you wouldn't normally...
I just know that I've loved you...
- ...since the first time I saw you.
- Jerry. No, no.
You don't love me.
- Sure I do.
- No.
- I don't?
- No.
Uh...
I thought that, uh...
Well, I thought...
I just thought that maybe...
Jerry.
Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry.
I'm sorry. Jerry, I'm sorry.
- Hello?
- Alice, we have a call...
- ...from the Milwaukee post office.
- Yeah?
The mail for Henry Finch is being forwarded here to Manhattan.
Where?
Foley Square. The
Criminal Courts Building.
I'd like to see Mr. Finch, please.
- Who?
- Henry Finch.
Is he expecting you?
My name is Sutton with the Justice Department.
I'd like to see
Mr. Finch immediately.
- He'll be right with you.
- Thank you.
What the hell is going on here?
I'm very impressed, Alice.
How's Jerry this morning?
The more important question is, who are you?
Those are much bigger questions than you think.
Please sit down.
For... reasons that will soon be... regrettably clear, I'm going to tell you a secret.
Then you can judge what and who I am.
Years ago...
I worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency... on the MK ULTRA program.
Are you familiar with it?
It was mind control.
"Manchurian Candidate" kind of stuff.
That's a vulgar generalization.
But yes, uh, you take an ordinary man... and turn him into an assassin.
That was our goal.
Now, MK ULTRA was terminated in 1973.
But... not the... research.
That, I continued.
Shall I go on?
"The truth will set you free." it involved hallucinogenic research... electroshock to induce vegetative states... terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Terminal?
As in, "resulting in death."
Alice, I'm, uh...
I'm now trying to pay my penance.
These things that you're talking about, you did them to Jerry?
MK ULTRA was science, sanctioned by the government.
It all ended... the moment John Hinckley shot Ronald Reagan.
No, that wasn't us.
But the technology had been stolen.
Pandora's box opened.
My subjects were taken from me, used in the private sector.
Jerry was one of them.
One of your subjects.
It is imperative that I discover who stole the technology.
Alice, I will do what is necessary... to stimulate Jerry into telling me what he knows.
Jerry is very dangerous.
Jerry has killed.
To find who programmed Jerry...
I have to find Jerry, but I can't do that without you.
Do you recognize this?
Where did you get that?
You do recognize it, then?
Of course I do.
It belonged to my father.
Where did you get it?
Alice, what do you know about your father's death?
He denied a man in prison appeal for a new trial.
Ezekiel Walters.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
When they found him, he was holding his wallet.
The only thing missing was this photo.
Where did you find it?
Jerry's safe deposit box.
Alice, when do you think Jerry first took notice of you?
What is it the two of you have in common?
I was mugged and he saved me.
He may have saved you, Alice, but that was no coincidence.
Come on, you're a lawyer.
Think like one.
Your father was assassinated.
And the sick son of a bitch has been obsessed with you ever since.
I am so sorry, Alice.
I truly am.
- Miss Sutton?
- Uh...
Hold on one second.
- Alice, you order pizza?
- No.
- Oh.
- Hold it.
"Go to the northeast corner..." of Greenwich and Battery Place.
"Bring the pizza. I have something important to tell you."
Call Bill in Security and tell him Fletcher's in the area.
I will, sir.
"I have something important to tell you."
Alice.
I have tried everything
I know to get Jerry to talk.
Would you try?
I promise you, you'll be perfectly safe.
No way. No way. Alice... you don't have to do this.
- I will.
- Good girl.
I want a bug in this box, audio and track.
Right away.
Hey, that still hot?
Hop in. Doesn't pay to stand around too long.
This is 42-K. We're on him.
Thanks.
I'm starving.
Unh.
This is good.
Have some.
- Do you have him on that?
- We still got him.
Are you okay, Alice?
No, you're not. I shouldn't have said all that stuff I said before.
I won't do that anymore. Creeped you out. I can't help the way I feel.
Jerry, what did you want to talk to me about?
Ah.
I can feel what I... I mean,
I can think? No, I can feel... what I want to say, but I can't think it. No. I can't get it out.
I got blank spots...
I've heard enough. Stop the car.
- I want her out of there.
- No! Keep driving.
It's kind of like, um, you know, if you sing along with the music.
If there's no music, then you know the words with the music.
- But if there's none, you're helpless.
- I don't understand.
Is something wrong?
No. Don't worry about it.
I want to take you where the music's playing.
The music is playing in Queens?
What? Oh. Uh, no, not today.
- Did she say Queens?
- Yes.
This is air unit one.
We've lost visual.
He's on the lower level. We'll pick him up on the other side.
- Where is he?
- Straight ahead.
About 300 yards.
- What?
- Nothing.
You see something?
- Hang on.
- Aah!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let's go.
- The pizza!
- Whoa, sorry. Sorry!
- The pizza.
- We don't need it.
I'll get you another pizza.
It wasn't that good.
- What's this?
- He stopped.
I have to go back and get the pizza.
- Aah!
- It'll all make sense in a minute.
Stop, stop, stop!
Okay, this is us. Hop in.
All mobile units watch him.
What do you see?
Slide across. I'll crank her up.
Yeah. Yeah, coming.
Air unit one, what do you see?
We see no traffic.
Repeat, no traffic.
We'll go down and take a look.
They've exited the vehicle.
- The pizza box is still in the car.
- Go.
Where are we going?
Connecticut.
We shut the bridge down. All off-ramps. Both levels. Got it?
Roger that. I'll take the west end.
Where are we going?
- Shh. Can you hear it?
- What?
The music, I can almost hear it.
I almost hear it.
We will.
We will.
Mr. Wilson's office.
Hello? Hello?
David Berkowitz.
Ted Bundy. Richard Speck.
What about them?
Serial killers.
Serial killers only have two names.
You ever notice that?
But lone gunman assassins... they always have three names.
John Wilkes Booth.
Lee Harvey Oswald.
Mark David Chapman.
John Hinckley, he shot Reagan.
He only has two names.
Yeah, but he only just shot
Reagan. Reagan didn't die.
If Reagan had died,
I'm pretty sure... we probably would all know what
John Hinckley's middle name was.
Mr. Wilson's office. Hello?
It's her. The line's open.
Get a trace on it.
- Hot one, line three trace.
- We got a cell trace.
This is my father's place.
This is where the music's playing.
I just thought of another one.
James Earl Ray. The guy that got Luther King.
Then there's Sirhan Sirhan.
I haven't figured that out.
Maybe it's Sirhan Sirhan Sirhan.
Here we got the stables and the main house is over there.
I guess I should just follow my nose.
What's your middle name, Jerry?
What? What do you mean?
- Did you kill my father?
- No.
Maybe.
- Maybe?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- No...
Ugh.
You were at the horse show that day. And, uh...
You never rode again after that.
I think maybe you blame yourself.
Oh, God, it's on the tip of my brain. I just...
He died right here.
He died right here.
Did he see you coming, Jerry?
Huh? Did he beg for his life?
You put a gun to his head and you shot him, didn't you? Didn't you?
He died in the dirt, like an animal!
Jerry, you killed my father!
Answer me! I have to know!
Tell me, please. Please, tell me.
Please tell me!
Please tell me. Please.
I... went to the court to kill your father.
I'm sorry.
That what I was programmed to do that. The Ezekiel Walters hearing.
I had a gun, and...
I couldn't shoot him. I couldn't do it because I saw you.
That was the first time I ever saw you.
That's the first time we met.
And, oh, boy, I knew that if I was to screw up... that Jonas, he was gonna send somebody else to do the job I didn't do.
So I decided to watch him and make him safe.
- Make it safe.
- Safe?
- He started carrying a gun.
- Oh, I know.
I know. He stuck it in my face the first time I tried to introduce myself.
And I had to... Had to...
Uh...
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him. We became friends. Yes.
Oh.
He made really good coffee.
And he tried to help me remember all of this stuff.
One of Jonas' guys...
No. One of... Unh.
When I got here, he was already dying.
When I... He was dying when I got here.
What does Jonas have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Ezekiel Carl Walters.
Ezekiel Carl Walters. Ezekiel
Walters is one of Jonas' fall guys!
He's the three name thing!
Ezekiel Carl Walters! You see? He...
Oh, he was innocent, innocent of everything.
Your father was gonna reopen the case.
He was gonna reopen the case because... he didn't accept the official story.
- Why?
- Because...
Because he believed me.
He believed me.
And...
He believed that I couldn't do what I was meant to do to him... and he was gonna blow it all wide-open... before Jonas sent someone else. He was gonna...
Oh.
When he was dying... he was still really worried about you.
He took your picture out of his wallet.
He called you his baby.
I told him I'd keep you safe.
And I kept your picture, and I've been watching you ever since.
I didn't... I didn't kill him.
But I was late and...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
I believe you.
He made great coffee.
Heh, yeah.
- What the?
- They traced my phone. Sorry. Oh, God!
- No! Before I go, I have to ask you one thing.
- What?
- Did you switch the charts?
- Now is not the time.
Now is all I got! Did you switch them? Did you?
- Yes.
- I knew it. I knew it!
Freeze!
- Freeze!
- Get away from her!
- Get off me!
- Leave her alone!
Get off me!
Let go of me! Jerry!
Get off her!
Jerry!
You really embarrassed me, Jerry.
You made certain people take notice of me who shouldn't have.
Alice, are you all right?
Wilson!
Alice.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.
It's a moment without hope.
You've never seen her run.
Agh!
This will put my words in your mouth.
Once this does its job, you'll swear that you killed her yourself.
She's dead, you know.
Well, then you can't hurt me anymore.
I'll be the judge of that.
Come on in. I'll get the lights.
Holy shit.
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.
When I was in here last night, there were, like, desks.
That's messed up. I'm going to call management right now. This is not good.
You guys, I'll meet you downstairs. Go ahead.
Come on.
Who's the Deputy
Director of the FBI?
You think we have time for 20 Questions?
Hold it right there. Put your hands in the air.
What gave me away?
Nothing. I just wanted to make sure.
Who are you guys?
If the intelligence world was a family... think of us as the uncle no one ever talks about.
We watched Jerry.
Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Jonas has shown himself.
Why don't you take him?
Jonas builds assassins.
We need to know who they are, where they are and who Jonas works for.
Jonas had my father killed, didn't he?
We think so.
- Do you know where Jerry is?
- No.
I wish I did. Honest.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna find him... because he'd find me.
- Let's work together on this.
- I don't think that's a good idea.
Let me give you a number where you can call if you need me.
Hey! Hands in the air.
I'm sorry.
Everybody's sorry.
Geronimo.
Son of a bitch.
The president left the area moments earlier...
and is currently safe in Germany.
The quake in southern Turkey measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.
Thousands are feared missing or dead. More on this story as it...
Can I help you?
Yes. I'm with the
Justice Department.
I need to see any male patients who have been brought in in the last 12 hours.
Justice Department? You got some credentials, a badge or something?
This is the Treasury Department.
But it'll do. Come on, let's go.
You're just too good to be true
That's better.
Yo, Marie! What happened to those two guys came in this morning?
They were transferred to
Mount Vernon immediately.
Sorry.
Jerry?
Jerry? Hey, Jerry!
Jerry, can you hear me?
Jerry. Jerry?
Can you hear me, Jerry?
You're just too good to be true
You're just too good to be true
Jerry, tell me where you are. Jerry!
Jerry?
I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
Through all the lonely nights
Hi, Alice.
Hi, Jerry.
- Alice, I'm sorry you're dead.
- Jerry.
- Unh.
- Jerry, tell me where you are.
Right here.
Uh...
- Um...
- Where's "here," Jerry?
On the floor. I'm... Uh...
Behind a waffle or a...
The paint is peeling on the ceiling.
That rhymes.
Peeling on the ceiling.
Nice views, and I can...
I can see the smokestacks in the light.
Good views.
Where can you see the smokestacks in this building?
Smokestacks? Um, smokestacks.
That would be the power station.
You can see it from the north wing, upstairs, but that's been closed for two years.
Take me there, right now. Jerry,
I'm coming to get you. Come on.
Alice? Alice?
You can fit through there?
Around this corner.
Down the hall.
Just honk the horn. I'll come out.
Yeah, this is it.
- You have a key?
- I don't have a key.
- Can you break it open?
- Lady, hundred bucks doesn't cover this.
I'll clean the place up. I'll...
Whoa! No, wait!
- Let's think about this! Wait, come on.
- Come on.
This is as far as I go, lady.
Call the police and this man.
Tell them where I am.
I'll call for backup. Agh.
I'll call for backup.
Call Roto-Rooter, that's the name.
What'd you think this would get you, Jerry?
Ugh, how would I know?
I'm tied up on the floor.
I don't know, maybe
I wanted some attention.
I was lonely.
Wow.
Ooh, heh.
Are you all right?
Are you all right, huh?
This is, like, the best dream I ever had.
- Alice.
- Yeah?
Could you untie me?
Oh, my God, yes, of course. I'm sorry.
- North wing?
- Can I see some ID?
ID him, Flip.
- Through that door, but it's abandoned.
- No matter.
Oh, God! I'm sorry.
Can you walk?
I think so.
- Kiss me.
- What?
For luck.
Kiss me and...
- Jerry, you're crazy.
- No, I'm certifiable, I know... but kiss me once. Come on.
Kiss me, then we'll go.
Jerry, you continually surprise me.
Go. Go!
Alice.
I always seem to come between you and the men in your life.
No!
- Somebody help me!
- Unh.
Help me!
- Throw down your weapon!
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Get an ambulance here, now.
Geronimo.
Is that this place?
No, not anymore.
It's love. And... love gives you wings.
And helps you fly and we can fly away.
Yes, I do.
I do so.
I love you.
I do.
I love you too.
Now you tell me.
Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry! Jerry. No! Jerry.
Somebody help me, please!
Somebody help me! Jerry.
I'm right here. I'm here with you.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
No, I want to go with him. I want to stay with him! No! Please.
Stop pulling on me.
Jerry, I'm right here!
- Clear!
- Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry, look at me!
I miss your face.
Hi.
I'm back... if you'll have me, Johnny. Hmm?
Is that a "yes"?
Geronimo.
As long as they think you're dead, she's safe.
I kept my end of the bargain.
What about yours?
Yeah, I'll tell you all I can remember.
I'll give you all the gravy on
Jonas and his operation and...
You're gonna have to help me, though, Lowry.
It's coming back, but slow.
You got it.
By the way, my real name's Hatcher.
Pleased to meet you.
- Ow. Go easy on me.
- Oh, sorry about that.
I guess nothing was what it seemed to be, huh?
Guess not.
Except her.
Son of a bitch.
- Brought the morning paper for you.
- Thanks, Flip.
- It is Flip, isn't it?
- Yes, it's Flip.
Don't even think about it.
At least not for now.
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm the lonely nights
Baby, trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby
If it's quite all right
We're all right.
Baby
We got a future.
Hold you tight
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
You want my money, best throw some elbow into that.
$1.50. That's 2-bits shy a car wash.
$1.50 each.
No, man. You must have got me confused with some other idiot.
The rain's doing half your work.
Look here.
Bobby Earl, the cultured pearl.
What's up, Gomer?
Boys, take a break.
Bobby Earl, we got to talk.
- I said quit!
- Talk about what?
Take a ride.
- A ride.
- Please.
It's Wilcox.
I need a tech team at Ferguson's place.
What kind of car is that?
Leave him be!
You cracker son of a bitch!
- I should lock you up!
- Grandma, go inside.
- Can't you just leave him be?
- I'm all right, Grandma.
It's all right.
I'll be back before supper.
Grandma, why are they taking Bobby Earl?
Give me that head!
Let's shake up that cage, son!
You're not getting that meat tenderized enough?
Sit down!
Let's see what else we got to start with.
Look here, Bobby Earl!
Get the fuck up.
I'll ask you nicely, son.
Did you fuck her before or after you filleted her?
Country-ass motherfucker.
"Asshole," is it?
I'll show you!
Fucking asshole!
"At the first official electrocution in 1890...
"...the victim had the electrodes removed from his head...
"...after 15 seconds.
"Suddenly he opened his eyes and began gasping for air...
"...apparently unaware that he was supposed to be dead.
"The warden and all present lost their wits...
"...before calling for the current to be turned back on.
"Witnesses describe a blue flame playing about the base of the spine.
"This time the electricity flowed for four minutes.
"Over the years, other witnesses to electrocutions...
"...have described the prisoner catching fire...
"...the electricity so powerful...
"...that the eyeballs pop out onto the cheeks...
"...a sound like bacon frying.
"During the autopsy, the liver is so hot that it can't be touched by human hands.
"Despite its best efforts, this justice system has killed...
"...at least 23 innocent men...
"...and sentences blacks who kill whites...
"...seven times more than whites who kill blacks. "
1890...
... to the 1990s.
Over 100 years of progress.
You paint a grim picture indeed, Professor.
I wish you had been as vivid describing the victims.
They were people who suffered far more cruel and unusual punishment...
... than any our penal system could even imagine.
- I refuse to believe...
- Let me finish.
- Let me finish.
- Very well.
I submit to you, the issue is revenge.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, if you will.
No, I refuse to believe in any god or government...
... which is willing to trade torture for torture...
... or death for death.
In closing, Professor...
... if your wife...
... or child were murdered...
... how would you feel about that last statement of yours?
How would I feel?
Very much the same as yourself.
But I would not want their deaths avenged...
... by a system as cruel and capricious as this.
- You changed my mind.
- I thought I had you.
- They're going to kill my boy.
- Excuse me?
My grandson's in a Florida prison on Death Row for something he didn't do.
Good luck. I'll see you in Washington.
I'm sorry. I no longer practice law.
He said to me,
"Go up to Cambridge, Massachusetts.
"Find Mr. Paul Armstrong...
"...and give him this."
Well, thank you.
I'll read it and get back to you.
Read it now.
Come far?
Ochopee, Florida.
A long way.
"Victim was white. I am black.
No food or water."
Beaten?
By Mr. Tanny Brown, the black-hatingest police in Everglade County.
"Murder one.
"Death penalty."
The white judge was 87.
He called Bobby Earl an animal, ought to be shot.
It's 25 years since I practiced law.
If you say no, he said to go to Princeton,
New Jersey and find Mr. Harry Gilyard.
A good man.
But he said to come to you first.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Can I drive you somewhere?
Nowhere.
There a 2:00 a.m. Bus to Princeton from the Trailways station.
I can get there by myself.
Thank you for your time.
No, you keep it.
It's got your name on it.
Daddy!
Wonderful, wonderful.
Carry on.
Where's Mommy?
- Hi.
- What happened to you?
I was working in juvenile detention center this morning with this kid, Carlos.
He was in for dealing.
Usual rap sheet: Misdemeanors, history of drug use.
Half-hour in, I ask about his mother.
And he goes berserk.
I'm on my back seeing stars.
A day at the office.
An hour later,
I'm standing in front of the judge...
...convincing her he's perfect for the Crossroads program instead of jail.
How did you explain the eye?
I told her my husband's a wife beater.
Thank you very much.
Why don't you go back to being a lawyer?
It is safer.
For who? Me or the bad guys?
More popcorn, please.
Daddy will bring it.
Paul, how did the debate go?
Little old lady showed up tonight.
Tells me her grandson's on Death Row down in Florida.
A black kid. Went to Cornell.
Can I see it?
Back to the salt mines.
He needs a lawyer...
...not a teacher. And I need a drink.
Did you really read this?
Maybe this one is worth checking out.
Why don't you check it out?
You know Everglade County.
Can we sleep outside?
No way.
I'd sooner go to hell than into another courtroom.
This would be really good for you.
Put you in the real world.
Why is every fucking thing the real world except teaching?
That's the real world?
He's on Death Row. He's asking you to put your money where your mouth is.
All I'm saying is that...
...every once in a while you got to get a little bloody.
It's good for the soul.
- I see them.
- There they are.
Grandma!
Dad.
What's that on your face?
Hi, sweetness.
Welcome.
It's not a bad paper as papers go, but that's not saying much.
Delores, sweetheart.
Hey, Mr. Phil.
It's been a long time.
Paul Armstrong.
My son-in-law.
Delores Rodriguez, keeper of archives, news-trivia expert.
Buried three husbands.
Were it not for Libby, I could well be No. 4.
How is Libby's health?
It's good.
Pity.
Business.
Paul needs information on the Joanie Shriver murder.
That poor kid from Ochopee?
Watch your back in here.
We are on-line back to 1985.
Everything before that is on microfiche.
I'll see what else I can find.
How long?
That depends. You'll be amazed at what I can do with a little help.
Mr. Armstrong.
Sergeant Rogers?
Raise your arms, please.
Tape recorder.
There you go.
Your first time, Mr. Armstrong?
Buzz when you want out.
If you're unable to buzz, don't worry about it.
Sweet Jesus.
The old girl said you'd be coming up in here.
I said, "No.
"No, Grandma, he's too busy...
"...to come all the way from Harvard just to give me his time."
But praise God...
...here you is.
If I really talked with that verbal buck-and-shuffle...
...I'd be free today.
What's your game?
It's no game.
Funny thing about small-town Florida people.
Like crabs in a bucket, black or white.
One tries to climb out, the others hop on his back to put him back in.
Souls of Black Folk, DuBois.
I've read it.
I'm impressed.
Good.
I've always been that climb-out crab.
My mother OD'd on heroin when I was 13 up in Newark.
Grandma got me and brought me here.
I was high school valedictorian.
I got a full scholarship to Cornell, but...
...they treated me like an outsider.
How do you like Grandma?
She's something else.
She's very determined.
But why did you send her up to see me?
Because you are from a small town, like me.
Fife, Scotland. First in your family to attend a university.
Magna from Cambridge. Columbia Law.
Youngest assistant DA, 1960-69.
Joined a law firm, 1970.
1980 to the present...
...Harvard professor of law...
...author of Process and Law, and six books since.
I've read them all.
Enough.
Let's start.
Joanie Shriver.
The victim.
Eleven years old. White girl.
Snatched from the Ochopee
Elementary School, March 4, 1986.
Found a day later, raped and cut up in the Glades.
A teacher ID'd the car as somewhat like mine.
Officer Tanny Brown come and lock me up.
- I read the transcript.
- I'll tell you this:
Down here, if the chief head-banger takes a dislike to you...
...your ass is his.
He's a nigger who likes being a big fish...
He's black?
Yes.
In the new South, they've got black cops to torment your black ass.
It's called affirmative action.
Tell me about your confession.
My confession?
I was slapped.
I was punched.
Beaten with a phone book.
Made to piss myself, kicked.
Then Officer Brown...
...walked in.
Tanny, wait.
J.T., I need you to back me up on this one here.
Pretty Robert Earl.
I want to ask you...
Last time.
I told you. I swear.
I don't know this girl.
I have no reason to lie. I don't know her.
Come on, talk to me.
Come on, stop.
What did you say to her?
How'd you get her in the car? Say, "Ah."
Talk to me.
Talk to me.
I hate pretty motherfuckers like you.
I don't know no Joanie Shriver.
Pretty motherfucker, talk to me.
Ain't so pretty now, are you?
They had me in there 22 hours.
No food, no water, no sleep.
No bathroom.
You drove her...
...to an isolated section of the Everglades...
...approximately two and a half miles southeast of her home.
Yes.
Did you drive her to that location...
...with the full intent to kidnap, rape...
...sodomize and kill her?
Speak into the microphone.
Yes.
You feel better now, don't you?
You're a strange fruit, Robert Earl.
Strange fruit, indeed.
I'd have confessed to anything.
They spoon-fed me to the Row.
It's your word against theirs.
I didn't do it.
She's a pretty thing, but you couldn't tell it when they brought her in.
Bobby Earl was a very angry boy.
Parts of her chest and abdomen were so badly damaged...
...hard to tell how many times she was stabbed.
The cuts were...
...long, shallow at the ends, deep in the middle.
The wounds curved upward.
- A half-moon shape.
- Like a scimitar?
Yeah.
But miniature.
I'd say six inches, hilt to tip.
Your autopsy report...
...states that the girl was raped.
But there's no record of any semen.
There wasn't any.
There wasn't?
No. She was penetrated.
With no semen, how did you establish the O-positive blood?
We got that from the teeth and gums.
You said you examined Bobby Earl's hand...
...and found cuts that could be attributed to teeth marks.
That's right.
You never matched the dental plate to the cuts.
I didn't need to, once he confessed.
Did you know he was beaten for 22 hours before he gave his confession?
So he says.
The cuts on his hand could have been from the beating.
How convenient.
Armstrong?
Yes.
I'm Detective Wilcox.
Spoke on the phone about hooking up with Tanny Brown?
Yes. J.T. Wilcox.
That's right.
Tanny said he'd hook up with you this afternoon if you're still around.
Anything I can do?
If you have time later, thank you.
You got a busy afternoon lined up,
Mr. Armstrong.
Some people to see, yes.
Ever been here before?
No.
Come on. It's a nice little town.
How's old Bobby Earl doing?
He's holding it together.
"Holding it together."
I'd expect he would be
"holding it together."
Cold-hearted son of a bitch.
Stayed right frosty to the end.
Get that vehicle back in the street, Charlie.
That's the last time I'll tell you.
Sorry, J.T.
Then he just started spitting it out, like a goddamn machine.
Scared me to death.
Scared you to death?
What did Bobby Earl tell you?
About the bare-assed light bulb at 4:00 a.m.?
I beat on him with a rubber hose?
How about a phone book?
White pages or yellow pages?
Mr. Armstrong?
Now, you listen to me.
Do you think if I'd gotten physical with Bobby Earl...
...he wouldn't be wearing my anger all over him at that arraignment?
What do you think, Professor?
I'm impressed.
You have a nice day now.
Harvard University. Do tell.
I'm a graduate of Florida State.
Bobby Earl Ferguson.
Change of venue, denied.
Motion to suppress a confession, denied.
Objection to an all-white jury, overruled.
Noted for the record.
I said, "You'll have to plead guilty, take a 25-year hit.
"You'll have a life left when you come out."
He says, "But, sir, I didn't do it."
So he made you go to trial?
This matching blood statement by Dr. Doliveau...
...why didn't you challenge it?
Even us backwoods
Florida State Law School alumni know...
...that an O-positive match doesn't mean anything...
...unless you get genetic screening or an enzyme-base analysis.
You just narrowed it down to 40 million suspects.
How did this testimony survive cross-examination?
Half the people in the courtroom knew that woman well.
She's known here as a very fine physician.
And a doctor is a god.
You know that.
Pathetic.
Jury didn't care.
I'll tell you, worst thing in that courtroom was Bobby Earl himself.
He sat there, day after day, looking guilty as hell.
It's not a popularity contest.
I find that a naive statement, Counselor.
Is that what you teach your law students:
"The truth will prevail"?
When's the last time you tried a case?
It's been 25 years.
Does that make you feel better?
Hell.
Hang dog, show dog,
I don't think it'd make any difference...
...if Bobby Earl was a 6'4" golden-haired Caucasian...
...who just quarterbacked Florida State past Miami, 62-0 in the Cotton Bowl.
That jury won't disregard the boy's own words.
His confession was coerced.
Why didn't you get an expert to analyze his voice on tape?
I tried, sir.
Truly, I tried.
I know my job, Mr. Armstrong.
What you're not hearing is the fact...
...that people were sick with grief over that poor little girl.
They wanted their revenge!
The end.
Mr. McNair.
Many thanks for your time.
No matter what you think...
...I defended that boy pro bono because everybody has a right to legal counsel.
I paid for it dearly. I've lost half my business because I tried to defend him.
And he got the chair.
Imagine what it'd be like for me here if I'd gotten him acquitted.
We always have a teacher here at 3:00 to make sure...
... the boys don't get into horseplay or the girls while away the afternoon...
...gossiping and giggling on the corner.
Horseplay. Gossip.
Sweet.
That day it was about 3:10.
Most everyone was gone.
I saw her by the banyan tree.
She walked past the car, then turned...
...like someone in the car called her.
She walked back...
...and before she got in...
God.
I go to bed with this every night.
Her waving.
The car was parked under that tree?
Right like that there.
That far away?
When did the police show you the car for identification?
The police? They didn't.
They just showed me a photo.
A photo?
Really?
- From what angle?
- Angle?
Front, rear, side?
Side.
But you couldn't see the side from here.
Not if it was in that position.
It seemed like the car to me.
I was solid to myself when I said it.
I understand.
No, you don't!
You're tearing open a wound, coming here.
I'm only trying to get at what happened.
I am sorry for your grief.
Thanks for your time.
Miss Conklin...
...may I ask you one last question?
What color is that car?
Midnight blue.
Midnight blue.
Not dark blue? Black?
Midnight blue.
How can you be so sure?
Because that's Tanny Brown's car.
Everyone knows that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
Tanny Brown.
Paul Armstrong.
You're trying to get Robert Earl off the Row?
No.
I'm just trying to get some information.
Information?
Well, fair enough.
Let's get you some information.
- The girl got into the car right here.
- I know.
All right, fasten your seat belt.
Watch carefully.
Robert Earl made this right...
...still headed towards the girl's house.
See that house with the blue trim?
That's hers.
She'd wanted to go that way, but he took her this way.
That's where he popped her.
He's a pretty son of a bitch, but he's mean.
He's real mean.
Scream!
Scream!
I can't breathe.
Come on, big man like you.
You can scream louder than that.
Stop!
What the fuck was that nonsense about?
Trying to get you some information.
That is why you're here, right?
You be careful.
You're way beyond your perimeters.
Look around you, Mr. Armstrong.
Look where you are.
You smack dab in the middle of hell.
Took only five minutes to get here, and nobody can hear you scream for help...
...let alone an 11-year-old girl.
Getting the picture?
See it with Joanie Shriver's eyes?
I get the point.
You get the point?
They come through here.
He was probably carrying her.
No defensive wounds on her hands.
We figure he knocked her out cold in the car...
...at the intersection near her house.
Killed her while she was unconscious.
Otherwise, we'd have...
...seen stab wounds on her hands or...
...some of his skin underneath her nails.
This is it.
This is the kill spot.
The coroner said that the rape was premortem, some of the cuts too.
But he did a lot of damage to her after she was dead.
It's like he just went stone crazy.
He pushed her body in the water...
...and covered her up with some brush.
Want you to meet Joanie Shriver.
Take a look.
Daddy!
I'll get Mommy.
No, don't get Mommy just yet.
I've been thinking about you all day, sweetheart.
I love you very much.
I love you too.
Can you come back tonight?
No.
I can't come back tonight.
So I want you to sleep with Mommy.
Daddy, I'm too old for that.
It's not for you, it's for her.
Do it for me.
I'll do it for you.
Good girl.
I love you.
I love you too.
Damn!
They hate long stories about how you messed up their vehicles.
I hope you took that insurance option.
I like them lightning bolts, though.
Hell...
...you might not want to paint this over.
I know I wouldn't.
What do we got to do to get rid of you, Mr. Armstrong?
Convince me that Bobby Earl deserves to die.
Under the circumstances, that's not possible.
So I'm not going to waste time trying.
I do have a question for you.
Are you aware that he was picked up on kidnap charges in Dade County...
...a year prior to his arrest for Joanie Shriver's murder?
Case went all the way to trial.
Yeah, I bet "Mr. Victim" forgot to tell you about that.
And what was the result?
Prosecution's case collapsed on a technicality, I believe.
Acquitted or thrown out of court?
Look, Armstrong...
...I knew Robert Earl was bad news when I first saw him.
See him hanging around the school when I'd pick up my girls.
Hanging around with his pretty-boy looks and college-boy words.
He just felt wrong.
Wasn't just me who felt that way.
Every man in this department.
- Everybody in town.
- I still don't hear any evidence.
We didn't need any.
We had a confession.
If that's a confession...
...my ass is a banjo.
Damn arrogant Yankee son of a bitch!
He did it, goddamn it!
That man is an asshole!
Just calm the hell down.
You tell me that man never laid a hand on Bobby Earl in 22 hours?
He slapped him once or twice.
Which was it?
You and I both know it wasn't a textbook confession.
But it was enough to convict him!
This case hangs together by a thin thread.
You come down here, you start picking at them threads, it'll fall apart.
I don't want that.
I tell you something else.
I want to see Robert Earl go to the chair for what he did.
Tell me, what is your policy on taking guns into the interrogation room?
Very simple: We don't.
May I see your left ankle?
Please?
Looking for this?
I checked it with the duty sergeant.
You didn't take it out?
Point it at Bobby Earl?
No, sir.
You didn't stick it in his mouth and play Russian roulette?
No, sir.
Then how did I know where to look for it?
You're back.
Let's get started.
Why didn't you tell me about your run-ins?
What run-ins?
Those times when Tanny tried to bust me?
Come on.
Tanny Brown had nothing to do with your arrest in Dade County.
Dade County?
The charge was kidnapping.
That was bullshit.
Bullshit. I took some white girl for a ride in my car.
It was just a ride.
In fact, she asked me for that ride.
The arresting cracker happened to be a boyfriend of hers.
It should've been thrown out of court.
My life was different after that.
How?
How was your life different after that, if the case was thrown out?
They took away my scholarship.
A scholarship, for someone like me...
...is a trade-off, pure and simple.
I get a free ride, they get a better image.
As soon as I walked into court,
I couldn't live up to my end of the bargain.
They felt justified.
The same way Tanny felt justified looking for me...
Wait.
I don't follow you.
Imagine a man, a very bad man...
...driving a car south, driving off the turnpike into Ochopee.
He stops...
...takes a siesta under a banyan tree just outside a schoolyard.
Then he spots a little girl.
Pretty little girl.
He talks her into his car.
He's friendly when he needs to be.
Then he does it.
Right there in the Glades.
He drives on and never gives it another thought.
Go on.
That very bad man moves on down the line.
A waitress in the Keys...
...two tourists in Lakeland, a prostitute in Tampa, and finally...
...he gets sloppy.
Big-time sloppy.
That's murder one.
That's the Row. Death Row.
He's here?
Yes. And what does he find when he gets here?
A neighbor on the Row who's in for killing a little girl.
Yeah, a little blonde girl down in Ochopee.
All cut up and thrown in the swamps.
And he says:
"I know you didn't do it, because I did."
Then he starts laughing.
And he says, "You must be the sorriest fuck in this unit."
I can hear him every night.
Bobby Earl!
Why won't you talk to me?
Shut up, you crazy fuck!
Shut up!
It's like a death sentence on top of a death sentence.
He calls me his last victim.
Who is he?
Blair Sullivan.
You really had me going.
I was starting to think:
"Maybe the man is onto something."
What do you mean?
Funny thing is, you almost pulled it off, you almost got away with it.
Got away with what?
Your wife, Slick.
"Prentiss" is her maiden name, isn't it?
Yes. Was.
Was before she married you.
Laurie Prentiss, Assistant DA.
What about her?
She was the prosecutor on Robert Earl's kidnap trial in Dade. Ring any bells?
What you think?
Small-town police don't do their homework?
Don't know how to access information?
I don't understand exactly what kind of hidden agenda you got up your sleeve...
...but I'm telling you...
...stay out of my town.
I'd been plea bargaining everything that came across my desk.
I just wanted to show the good old boys how good I was.
I was hot for it.
Thought I had the case locked tight.
My star witness, the arresting officer.
He said when he came up on the car, that Bobby Earl was on top of her...
...in the back seat and she was screaming.
Two seconds into the cross-examination...
...the defense attorney produces a prom photo...
...with my star witness in a tuxedo with the victim.
Son of a bitch admits they were high school sweethearts!
I didn't want to give up, so...
...I got the judge to grant me a 24-hour recess so I could regroup.
I came back with nothing and he threw the case out.
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
I did. I told you when I met you.
Bullshit.
Should've told me when you read the letter.
- I didn't...
- Why not?
I didn't know if it would influence you.
That you might not take the case, you might not help this kid.
He paid dearly for what happened to him.
Why? Because he lost a scholarship and spent an extra night in prison?
No, Paul.
It was more than that.
Later, I found out that they beat him real bad that night.
He ended up in the hospital.
Listen.
It was my fault.
I want you to help him get his life back.
I want you to make it right for him.
No, Laurie, you want me to make it right for you.
You're right.
But how does what I'm telling you change his situation on Death Row?
Okay.
It was called "The Pilgrimage of Death."
It sold many papers.
The guy started with his landlady in New Orleans...
... a prostitute in Mobile and a sailor in Pensacola.
Then he got real busy.
A body every 100 miles.
When was Pensacola?
Late April, early May.
It was incredible.
APBs in three states,
FBI flyers all over the place...
...and no one spots him.
Painting, writing letters to the families of his victims...
...that's all he does.
Yeah, we got a whole other theme park for Mr. Sullivan.
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!
All right...
...he's all yours.
They don't like me very much.
Really?
Why is that?
Creative differences.
Tape recorder. May I?
Be my guest.
You have quite an art gallery back there.
Thank you.
Idle hands are the devil's workshop.
You believe in Jesus?
Yes, I do.
That's good.
That's very good.
I killed so many goddamn people...
...I can't keep up with my correspondence, but my question is:
Do you think any of those people got out of bed on their last day...
...thinking, "Today's my day to die"?
You got to take Jesus into your heart now, because you never know.
Even if you don't have a condition, you might have a situation.
You a killer too?
Me?
No.
You never went to war?
Korea? Vietnam?
Never did a hit-and-run with the BMW?
Never told the wifey to get an abortion?
Or that piece of chicken on the side,
"Here's $300, take care of it."
Because you got that look.
You got ice in your eyes.
I can tell.
You're wrong.
Am I now?
Mr. Armstrong...
...let's see whom we're talking to.
Are you married?
Yes.
Kids?
No.
Liar.
House or apartment?
A house.
Alarms on the windows?
Dogs?
Have trouble sleeping?
- No.
- Liar.
You afraid to die?
Don't think about it.
Liar!
That's three lies.
Same as Peter did to Jesus before the cock crowed.
You should be ashamed of yourself, lying to a condemned man.
Don't my...
...lies tell you as much about me as my truths?
Okay.
Would you do me a favor?
Mail this for me.
Thank you.
What do you want to talk to me for?
Ochopee.
Nice town.
What happened there?
You been talking to my old neighbor,
Bobby Earl. Excitable boy.
Did you kill Joanie Shriver?
Did I?
There been so many.
Did you kill Joanie Shriver?
You're starting to get all frantic and excited, just like Bobby Earl did.
Did you?
You're my first visitor in two years since those behavioral science boys visited me.
Wanted to know about my childhood.
Did my folks beat me, abuse me, sex me up?
I told them there ain't no formula for people like me.
What we're dealing with here is just a predisposition for an appetite.
You know, good parents, bad parents...
Ain't no cause and effect.
It's just an appetite.
Fuck you.
Let me tell you a few things, Armstrong.
One:
I am filled with power!
You may think I'm an impotent prisoner...
...locked in a cell each night and day, but I am filled with a strength...
...that reaches beyond these bars!
I can touch anyone I want to!
Just as easy as dialing the telephone!
There's no one beyond my reach!
You hear me? No one!
Did you kill her?
I ain't going to tell you if I did or not.
Even if I did, how would you know to believe me?
Killing is easy for me.
How hard do you think lying is?
Yeah. Go to hell.
I will.
No doubt about that.
What if I could help you find something?
Something important.
Something interesting.
Real important.
Like what?
Where is it?
- Not far from where they found her.
- Where?
They didn't read the signs.
What signs?
The Bible.
The Bible?
Ecclesiastes 11:1.
You can't miss it if you can read the signs.
What signs?
"Seek, and ye shall find."
- Do you have a Bible here?
- We have plenty. The Gideons love us.
- How'd it go?
- I wouldn't like him as a neighbor.
- He asked me to mail this.
- Not again. Goddamn him.
Wilkinsons.
Sick bastard.
I never send these letters.
Can't even read them anymore.
Hey, Roz, what's up, baby?
You saw Tyrone?
He is not telling you the truth.
You know he's lying.
I saw him with her last night.
Someone is here so I'll speak to you later.
All right, then.
Hi.
Is Tanny Brown here?
He's at a soccer practice with my brother.
Hi. I'm Lena.
- You must be Mr. Armstrong.
- Yeah? How do you know?
Everyone knows you're the guy my father was complaining about.
He'll be back in a few minutes.
Would you care for some iced tea?
- That would be very nice.
- Come in.
I'm going to study law too.
I graduated first in my high school class.
Good for you.
I'm thinking about going to the University of Virginia.
They have a great school and my mom lives in Newport News.
That's Joanie and me.
Daddy used to call us his girls.
I remember how we used to talk about opening up a pet shop together.
I miss her.
A day doesn't go by that I still don't talk to her.
To who?
- Maurice, go wash up for supper.
- But, Daddy...
Go! Is supper ready?
Take Mr. Armstrong's glass.
He was just leaving.
Get out of my house.
You shouldn't have been in charge.
- I'll have you arrested!
- Too close to the victim.
You got no right coming here and interrogating my kids!
You got no right telling me how to do my job!
How many times did she eat here, or sleep over with Lena?
Look, I got an office.
What you come around here for?
I thought you might be interested in recovering the knife.
All of a sudden you're Sherlock Holmes?
You're obviously not.
Any luck?
"Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days."
Ecclesiastes 11:1.
Blair Sullivan's directions.
Blair Sullivan?
"And if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north...
"...in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be."
Yeah, you're really onto something now,
Armstrong.
Really onto something.
Look here...
How you come to Blair Sullivan?
It's a long story.
Look around you.
Look where you at.
- You see where you are?
- Yes.
"Seek and ye shall find."
Sullivan must have bust a gut the minute he saw you coming.
Talking about the Bible.
Look...
...we must've had...
...50, 60 volunteers...
...poking and digging through here...
...trying to find that knife.
What's this?
That's a culvert. They run under the roads.
Keep them from washing away.
- What the hell was that?
- That's the local wildlife.
There's a couple hundred of them here, if you want to keep looking.
Do people live in a place like that?
Hell, no.
An old poacher's shack, what they call a hunting blind.
It's a camp for gator hunters.
Do the skinning there, rest up in the evening. It's a nighttime thing.
What the hell is he doing now?
What now?
Look at this: One, one, one.
What about it?
Sullivan said we have to read the signs.
Eleven-one. Chapter eleven, verse one.
You're a real hard case.
You know that?
You're fishing! Nothing's out here!
You're fishing!
The man's an idiot!
Goddamn it!
How about this?
North, south. South, north.
That's a tree.
Make your point.
Step down here, please.
I've just about run out of patience with you.
Step down.
I hope this is good.
Pick that up.
Is something wrong with your hands?
No, but if it is the murder weapon...
...technically it's better to be discovered by the police.
I see.
That way we won't jeopardize my legal position.
Thank you, Professor.
Goddamn!
Goddamn you, Armstrong.
You got a lot of explaining to do.
Sullivan...
...all but admitted that he killed the girl...
...without anyone sticking a gun in his mouth.
Fuck Blair Sullivan and fuck you too!
No! Rejoice!
For a great injustice is about to be undone!
What did Sullivan drive?
Three cars.
All stolen.
What was he driving in Florida?
Green Monarch.
Damn.
We need a Ford Granada.
I see your Monarch...
...I raise you Bobby Earl's...
...Granada.
They're almost identical.
I'm no friend of capital punishment...
...but at least the letters will stop.
More of Sullivan's correspondence.
That's the lot?
So far.
Warden.
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Shriver...
"...I've been wrong not to write sooner...
"...but I've been real busy getting ready to die.
"I just wanted you to know what a real...
"...sweet piece of business...
"...your little baby was.
"Doing her...
"...was like carving up...
"...a ripe melon...
"...like picking ripe cherries on a summer morning...
"...like plowing a scented field, and plow her I did.
"But I don't imagine anything will come of that particular crop...
"...come harvest time, do you?"
It's signed, "Your friend...
"...Blair Sullivan."
Now...
...he doesn't specifically...
...say in this letter that he killed
Joanie Shriver.
Does he?
No.
He said what I read.
That being with her was "like carving up...
"...a ripe melon."
Nothing further.
How does freedom feel?
- I'd like to thank...
- Your attorney.
...my attorney, Mr. Lyle Morgan.
My grandma for never giving up hope, and Professor Paul Armstrong.
Without him, I wouldn't be here.
How are you?
I'm very happy for you.
I'm happy for both of us.
Professor.
Thank you.
Before we go back...
...come for drinks Friday.
I'd love to...
...but I can't. I made other plans.
We'll meet again.
I promise you.
- You ready?
- Congratulations.
Have a safe trip.
Hey, Mr. Ferguson. Congratulations.
Got them all fooled, don't you? Judge...
...even that know-nothing Harvard fool.
But not me.
No, sir.
Not Tanny Brown.
I'll be all over you like white on rice.
You hear?
Come on.
Miss Evangeline.
"But they all disappear
"From view
"'Cause I only have eyes for you"
I love you.
The firm's been more successful than I dreamed.
Are you single?
I've been married for eight years.
Good. It's time for you to fool around.
Champagne, anyone?
Yes, I'd love some. Thank you, Phil.
You ought to stay a few days and make it a real vacation.
No, we must get back. I'm behind on my caseload. Paul has classes.
Paul, I think you missed your true calling.
You should've been a detective.
No, thanks. I'm quite happy to get out of the real world.
Here we go. A little refreshment.
Katie, get the phone.
I would like to propose a toast.
To innocence revealed.
To death denied.
To the triumph of truth over appearance.
Hear, hear.
Telephone for you, Daddy.
Don't finish it.
What are you doing later?
After the party?
I have an appointment.
In fact, I must leave now.
Congratulations, Professor.
Sullivan?
How'd you get this number?
I've got all your numbers.
Been a big week for you.
Been a big week for me too.
Sure you know the governor signed my death warrant.
I got less time than it takes to play a round of golf.
Anyways...
...my letter sewed it up tight for you.
We thought that might do the trick.
We?
Who's "we"?
I'll tell you when you come.
Things worked out kind of perfect for you, didn't it?
Maybe too perfect.
You got a pen?
13 Tula Way.
Winterglade.
My folks' place.
I want you to call on them.
I want you to say good-bye for me.
Tell them I love them...
...and that they are in my prayers...
...and then you come to me.
You do that for me...
... and I'll tell you who "we" is.
You best run, Armstrong.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Takes me back to my youth.
I want to remind you all of next Sunday's fish fry.
And now, from the bounty of the Lord...
...Amazing Grace on Everglade Christian Radio.
"So the dead which he slew at his death...
"...were more than they which he slew in his life."
Judges 16:30.
I told you I had power.
Not this time.
So tell me...
...what did you see?
What did you hear?
Give me all the details.
Spare me nothing. Come on.
Come on, I want everything.
Come on.
No.
When you called me to say:
"We thought the letter would do the trick"...
...who did you mean by "we"?
Tell me what you saw.
Tell me about my folks. That was the deal.
Okay.
Why not?
By "we," I meant me and the shining boy of the hour.
I pushed the buttons to make you do the dance...
...to spring our boy...
...who, in turn, did the deed.
"The deed"?
You know what I mean.
I had some unfinished business out there.
I gave Bobby Earl life...
...so he could give me death.
Joanie Shriver?
I never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance.
Bobby Earl coached me a little bit on the details.
All I had to do to take his crime was tell you where the knife was...
...and write that letter.
You should see your face, Armstrong!
What's going on up there?
Why me?
We needed a legitimizer.
Who'd believe us? We're just psychopaths.
Why me?
You were Bobby Earl's con.
And he had his reasons.
Reasons?
It's my turn.
What reasons?
No, it's my turn now!
Come on.
How did my folks look?
How did they smell?
Tell me everything.
Spare me nothing.
They said they forgive you and will remember you in their prayers.
No!
Yeah.
I'm sure you're lying, cocksucker!
You inhuman bastard!
You cannot cheat me of this!
Come on!
We played you like a tune! It ain't over!
You got the trials of Job ahead of you!
The trials of Job! The sin is pride, you fucker, and the messenger is revenge!
We played you like a tune!
It ain't over yet!
- I told you how fragile this thing was.
- Yes, you're right.
- You were right.
- You know where I am?
I'm at the Sullivan house now and I want to tell you...
... it's a good thing I put Wilcox on his tail.
- "In the name of the Father, the Son..."
- Shut up!
- "...and the Holy Spirit..."
- Shut up, please!
Shut up!
"As governor of the state of Florida..."
I have a confession from Sullivan on tape and it is evidence.
You're a goddamn fool.
First you had evidence this way, now you got evidence that way.
His confession don't mean shit unless he testifies in court.
Don't lecture me about confessions, not after the way you got Bobby Earl's.
"To cause the sentence of death to be executed on Blair Sullivan."
Armstrong, you keep Sullivan alive.
"Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
"Give us this day our daily bread.
"And forgive us our trespasses."
Are you packed?
Where are you?
I'm right on top of him.
Collins and 50th.
I want you to stay on his tail, but don't jump him until I tell you.
You were Bobby Earl's con.
And he had his reasons.
- It's my turn.
- What reasons?
No, it's my turn now!
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Did she leave any messages for me?
Just one moment, sir.
We played you like a tune! It ain't over!
You got the trials of Job ahead!
The trials of Job! The sin is pride...
- Sorry, sir, no messages.
- ... and the messenger is revenge!
On, no, I left him!
Angus!
- Who?
- The bear Daddy gave me. I left him!
- We gave the key back.
- We can't just leave him!
Come on, we'll find a maid.
Maybe she'll let us in the room.
Don't let anyone touch that luggage.
All right?
I'll be right back.
I got to call Mom and Dad.
- Did I get the laundry?
- I think so.
Good.
The maid wouldn't take Angus, right?
I don't think so.
You must take better care of your stuff.
I know.
We'll go in your car. Get your keys out.
You better lock it up, girl.
Get the keys out.
We'll have ourselves a little ride.
Come on, Wilcox, pick up the damn phone.
- Get in.
- Leave her here.
Move your hand or I'll cut her head off!
Get in!
Hurry up!
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Come on, pick it up.
Come in, quick.
Get in the car!
That's Laurie's car!
I think Bobby Earl has them!
Where is Wilcox?
Where are we going?
It's a surprise.
Stop touching her.
I'm out of my jurisdiction here.
I need to call for backup.
Why are you doing this?
He saved your life.
Bitch, that don't make up for what you did to me.
Let her go. She didn't do anything to you.
- She's a part of you.
- Let her go.
She's a tiny version of you.
She'll grow up and be a hero.
- It's okay.
- Shut up!
Get down, in case he sees you.
Damn.
Pull over! To the left!
Where?
I'll kill her!
They're going against the traffic!
Bitch, drive!
Take it! Punch it!
Punch the gas! Punch it!
Punch it!
Bitch, you better drive! Punch it!
I'll kill her! I'll take her now!
Professor?
Listen up.
Daddy?
Got me a double date.
Remember Joanie Shriver? That's nothing compared to what I'll do to your girl.
There's the car.
It's the only place he'd be.
Keep your eyes open, Armstrong.
We're in his backyard now.
We need to split up.
I'm going to go around back.
Here...
...squeeze one off if you have to.
Don't try to hit nothing.
Just point and squeeze.
- Where is he?
- Hurry.
Get it off my mouth.
He's out there.
Hurry!
He's out there somewhere!
Get Katie out of here.
Quick!
Everything's going to be all right.
I don't know if he's coming back.
Welcome to the party, Professor.
Stop it!
Give me Tanny's gun.
He couldn't stand to see me free, living the good life...
...so I killed the fucker.
Let them go. You have me now.
It's not you that I want, Professor.
Is it Laurie?
It's not you I've been waiting for and thinking about the last eight years.
But she dropped her case against you.
Not soon enough.
You had me held for just one night so you could make a name for yourself.
Sullivan was right.
"The sin is pride."
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
I had no idea they'd hurt you.
Hurt me?
Do you want to see what those fuckers did to me?
They cut me.
They castrated me!
You feel that?
You had me...
Did you think they'd give a shit about justice?
Sit down!
Like that knife?
That's what put me on the Row and eight years later that's what made me free.
Please, let Katie go.
She's just a little girl.
I'm saving Katie for dessert.
Now I'm going to do me these two lovely ladies of yours.
Easy!
Then I'll disappear.
What I need to know from you is how do you want to die, first or last?
And Blair Sullivan?
Watch your fucking hands!
What about him?
Don't fuck with me, Armstrong.
Sullivan is dead.
No. The governor gave him a stay of execution.
You're a desperate man, Armstrong.
I brought him the news.
What fucking news?
That his parents were still alive and well.
No, it's my turn now!
How did my folks look?
How did they smell?
They said they forgive you and will remember you in their prayers.
You're a fucking liar!
Sullivan will testify against you.
- You inhuman bastard!
- Liar!
You cannot cheat me of this!
We played you like a tune!
It ain't over yet! You got the trials of Job ahead of you!
The trials of Job!
Get your ass out of the water.
You all right there, Armstrong?
I'm in better shape than you are.
I loved Joanie Shriver like she was my own.
Are you going to be okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Least we'll be able to sleep at night.
We'll see.
{4725}{4812}We need about five minutes|before I make a statement.
{5519}{5585}Look at this. How do they always|get here before we do?
{5586}{5624}Police band radios.
{5626}{5730}That was a rhetorical question, David.|I didn't really expect an answer.
{5742}{5849}You know me, Curtis. I think most of them|would look better in plastic zipper suits.
{5851}{5884}Did you bring a smoke?
{5886}{5963}No, I figured something like fingerprints|we could just guess.
{5965}{6013}Yeah, I brought the smoke.
{6109}{6186}{y:i}What I can tell you is,|{y:i}we've got a multiple homicide.
{6204}{6266}{y:i}No suspects are in custody|{y:i}at the present time.
{6273}{6319}Kevin, you want the statement?
{6320}{6420}Forensics has given us a significant lead,|which we are investigating.
{6426}{6455}That's all for now.
{6475}{6512}{y:i}I'm sorry. That's it.
{6575}{6615}Glad you could join us.
{6617}{6698}Your boss is already in there|shuffling around, scratching his ass...
{6700}{6757}...praying for divine inspiration.
{6759}{6833}- What's the lead?|- Who said we had a lead?
{6842}{6894}You did.|You said Forensics gave you a lead.
{6896}{6938}What am I supposed to say, Dave?
{6939}{7047}The ME can't find anything, so we had to|bring in his brilliant assistant?
{7049}{7100}If it ain't Count fuckin' Dracula.
{7128}{7197}- Give it a rest, Stew.|- Still not talking?
{7201}{7282}You'll like it in there, Doc.|It's your kind of party.
{7405}{7499}Her name's Donna Berman,|a student at the Seattle Art Institute.
{7512}{7545}Fucking shame.
{7570}{7643}We got that guy,|we got two bods in the back.
{8167}{8275}Here we got Mr. Wu,|and back here is Mr. Chang.
{8527}{8550}Hi, Michael.
{8584}{8608}David.
{8654}{8700}It's provocative, isn't it?
{8770}{8829}The position of the bodies|indicates two shooters...
{8830}{8893}...one by the counter,|the other by the door.
{8901}{8994}Wounds look like.45s.|Probably a failed stick-up.
{9005}{9106}Judging from the holes in the wall and the|blood splatter, I'd say it was a Magnum.
{9115}{9156}My guess, a.357.
{9188}{9278}If it was a stick-up,|the perp wasn't looking for money.
{9280}{9334}- How do you know that?|- Look.
{9516}{9603}Okay, I'd like a full report|on my desk by 9:00 a.m.
{9605}{9675}I have a press conference at 10:00.|You got that?
{9677}{9712}Yeah, okay.
{9758}{9815}- Good night.|- See you tomorrow.
{9917}{9952}All right.
{9987}{10013}Let's smoke it.
{10166}{10231}That's good with the smoke, thank you.
{10446}{10494}Here we go. Right here.
{10527}{10564}This one's been wiped.
{10632}{10715}Let's do an inventory,|and find out what was in these drawers.
{10723}{10790}Harold, inventory of the drawer, please.
{10818}{10897}Try drugs, Doc. It's a fuckin' drug store.
{10919}{11004}Drug store hit by a junkie.|Who would have thought?
{11015}{11065}Pretty fancy forensic work.
{11074}{11113}Thank you, Stewart.
{11129}{11200}When Dick Tracy's done in there, lock it up.
{11833}{11911}David, I found a candy bar. It's a PayDay.
{11920}{11984}No prints, but the bite mark's not bad.
{12001}{12028}What?
{12168}{12210}You think there's a connection?
{12211}{12309}Absolutely. Do a 48-hour rush|DNA analysis on the candy bar.
{12311}{12368}- What am I going to tell Stratton?|- Nothing.
{12370}{12440}You know what that's gonna cost?|He'll see the paperwork.
{12442}{12507}Just tell him it's routine.|He won't know the difference.
{12509}{12585}When I get fired,|will you visit me at the homeless shelter?
{12587}{12641}Curtis, help me out, please.
{12661}{12705}Okay? Please.
{12730}{12774}- All right.|- Thank you.
{12814}{12930}This is a photo from tonight's pharmacy,|and this is one from Mary's office. Look.
{13106}{13141}What's your point?
{13143}{13209}The pharmacy shooter could be my guy.
{13263}{13351}How many guys do you know|that twist up a matchbook like this?
{13352}{13384}Look at it.
{13454}{13551}It's 4:30 in the fucking morning,|and I've been up for 18 hours.
{13559}{13665}- What do you want me to do?|- I want you to question him about my wife.
{13696}{13723}That's it?
{13771}{13799}Yeah.
{13820}{13899}Well, you got it.|I want to get this guy, too.
{13923}{13971}I know it's been hard on you, Dave.
{14010}{14050}But sometimes...
{14066}{14121}...you just gotta let things go.
{14199}{14235}I can't, Don.
{14398}{14430}Thanks.
{14443}{14484}We'll get this guy.
{14521}{14579}- Is that it, Daddy?|- Let me see.
{14601}{14644}Yes, that's where I grew up.
{14645}{14751}Right over here is where I went|to high school, Garfield High.
{14764}{14847}- Same high school as Jimi Hendrix.|- Who's Jimi Hendrix?
{14863}{14929}Did Mommy go to|Garfield High School, too?
{14981}{15005}No.
{15011}{15098}She went to high school up north,|next to the university.
{15123}{15192}- Is that where she became a lawyer?|- Yes.
{15217}{15267}I want to be a lawyer, just like Mommy.
{15274}{15331}I thought you wanted to be a doctor,|like me.
{15333}{15388}No. Lawyers make more money.
{15404}{15469}- They do, do they?|- Yes, they do.
{15505}{15581}What about you, Cara?|What do you want to be?
{15607}{15681}I don't know. Can we go?|It's cold up here.
{15741}{15768}Okay.
{16153}{16208}- Did you have a good time?|- Yeah.
{16224}{16305}- How about you, Cara?|- It was okay, I guess.
{16348}{16405}Cara! Lindy! Over here.
{16449}{16500}Bye, Dad. We're going ice-skating tonight.
{16501}{16534}Don't I get a kiss?
{16612}{16635}Sorry.
{16781}{16836}- I love you.|- I love you, too.
{16839}{16889}- See you next week?|- Okay.
{16899}{16932}Gotta go.
{17007}{17048}Look what Dad got me.
{17050}{17114}- I get the front seat.|- No, you don't.
{17150}{17219}You get in the back, you get in the front.
{18738}{18792}- Sheila.|- You forgot.
{18810}{18892}The Wahlic Foundation, for dinner,|we had a date?
{18961}{18988}Yeah, I did.
{18990}{19065}{y:i}The next logical step for me was transfer.
{19085}{19184}{y:i}My original thesis of transferring|{y:i}intelligence was quite simple.
{19186}{19235}{y:i}The implications are obvious...
{19237}{19337}{y:i}... helping the mentally impaired|{y:i}or those with learning disabilities.
{19351}{19440}{y:i}Of course, who wouldn't want a piece|{y:i}of Einstein's brain power.
{19640}{19745}{y:i}To date I've made successful transfers|{y:i}of neuroelectrical impulses.
{19756}{19850}{y:i}Of course, it's impossible|{y:i}to get into the mind of rab lats.
{19908}{19950}{y:i}I mean, lab rats.
{19983}{20046}{y:i}But my findings show|{y:i}that they respond to the memory...
{20048}{20102}{y:i}... of certain incidents more than others.
{20118}{20157}{y:i}To us these would be things like...
{20159}{20247}{y:i}... your first date, your first kiss,|{y:i}or your first car wreck.
{20264}{20334}{y:i}Events or traumas in our lives|{y:i}that are so powerful...
{20336}{20385}{y:i}... they are unforgettable.
{20603}{20637}Excuse me.
{20832}{20865}What are you having?
{20899}{20937}A Maker's Mark.
{20948}{21029}- Maker's Mark and a mineral water, please.|- On ice.
{21106}{21158}I hadn't thought about|my first date in years.
{21159}{21208}- Sorry?|- Your speech.
{21223}{21267}First date, first kiss.
{21277}{21379}You were listening.|I thought I put the room to sleep.
{21381}{21494}It wasn't you. I think people tend to drink|more than usual at these kinds of dinners.
{21496}{21556}They want to get their money's worth.|Thank you.
{21617}{21648}And you?
{21674}{21735}I'm actually very interested in your work.
{21737}{21773}- Really?|- Yeah.
{21818}{21902}I'm glad I got a chance to meet you.|My name's David.
{21924}{21994}Martha. You're a neuroscientist?
{21998}{22071}No, I was a closet microbiologist in school.
{22127}{22226}- So you've really transferred memory?|- In lab rats, yes.
{22237}{22288}- Really? How?|- Excuse me.
{22309}{22382}They're going over to Cutter's|for a nightcap. Are you ready?
{22384}{22455}- Yeah, I'll be right with you.|- Okay.
{22551}{22585}I'm sorry.
{22607}{22644}I've gotta go.
{22663}{22744}I'd love to know more about your work.|Can I call you?
{22797}{22841}Sure, if you want.
{22865}{22955}Or you can stop by the university.|I'm there every day.
{22962}{23032}- Great. How about tomorrow?|- Tomorrow?
{23088}{23125}In the morning I'm free.
{23145}{23191}- 9:00 a.m.?|- That's great.
{23193}{23236}Great. Thanks a lot.
{23247}{23323}I look forward to talking with you.|Good night.
{23425}{23465}What's he like?
{23578}{23659}- He's just interested in the work.|- Sure he is.
{23698}{23734}That's what he said.
{23735}{23824}- You know who it is, don't you?|- No, I've never seen him before.
{23826}{23927}It's Dr. Krane. The medical examiner|who murdered his wife.
{23990}{24056}They all but caught that guy|crushing her skull in.
{24058}{24138}If the police hadn't botched the case,|he'd be on death row by now.
{24157}{24215}He seemed like a nice guy.
{24217}{24328}I'm sure he is. But if you go out with him,|make sure you wear a crash helmet.
{26448}{26485}Good morning.
{26505}{26544}Hi, Dr. Krane.
{26617}{26673}- You're early.|- I couldn't wait.
{26675}{26720}Do you still have time?
{26765}{26790}Sure.
{26803}{26855}- Do you need a hand?|- No.
{27251}{27318}Maybe it's easier if I just show you.
{27326}{27355}Great.
{27531}{27573}Good morning, Zelda.
{28040}{28070}Ready?
{28683}{28745}Animal rights people know about you?
{28885}{28941}As you know, Dr. Krane,|neuropeptides mediate...
{28943}{28986}David.
{29018}{29105}Neuropeptides mediate memory storage|and retrieval in the brain.
{29130}{29228}In theory a person's thought and memory|is contained in his cerebral spinal fluid.
{29230}{29283}- The CSF.|- Right.
{29285}{29374}But if you injected CSF,|you wouldn't see a thing. Why?
{29378}{29448}Because there's no starter,|there's no primer.
{29450}{29564}I started thinking about neuroactive drugs,|like norepinephrine and adrenaline.
{29566}{29659}They'd increase the brain's sensitivity|during memory retrieval.
{29675}{29702}Very good.
{29744}{29784}Hence, your starter.
{29792}{29817}Exactly.
{29839}{29901}This is it. My transfer formula.
{29903}{29993}It's a combination of norepinephrine,|a GABA inhibitor...
{30005}{30055}...and a few other things.
{30439}{30514}When injected, the brain experiences|these new memory impulses...
{30516}{30563}...as if they were its own.
{30647}{30741}For these impulses to be triggered,|the brain requires an outside stimulant...
{30743}{30854}...such as a sight, sound, or smell|that's familiar to the other brain's memory.
{30887}{30949}This rat isn't familiar with the maze,|as you just saw.
{30951}{31002}This is CSF from a rat|who knows the maze.
{31004}{31124}By injecting this CSF into this rat, he|should be able to run the maze perfectly.
{31126}{31196}- And the cat is...|- The outside stimulant.
{31205}{31260}It's there to make the memory more vivid.
{31632}{31657}Yes.
{31761}{31815}It has an 80% success rate.
{31825}{31935}- When do you start human trials?|- That's a long way off.
{31949}{31975}Why?
{31995}{32041}There are a few complications...
{32043}{32112}...not to mention about seven years'|worth of paperwork.
{32114}{32164}What kind of complications?
{32170}{32244}Like, the norepinephrine|stimulates the heart.
{32257}{32325}Heart rate and blood pressure|of all the rats increased.
{32327}{32403}- Unfortunately, 30% of them...|- Had heart attacks.
{32408}{32438}Can't reduce the dosage.
{32440}{32556}Anything that would inhibit the side effects|would also inhibit the memory retrieval.
{32558}{32613}What about taking nitroglycerine?
{32615}{32661}It might solve the short-term problems...
{32663}{32764}...but you'd still run the risk|of long-term damage to the heart.
{32870}{32938}CSF is routinely taken in all autopsies.
{32980}{33009}I know.
{33066}{33160}Every forensic pathologist has at least|one or two cases that can't be solved.
{33351}{33426}I have a class in 10 minutes.
{33449}{33498}I'd be willing to try it.
{33780}{33809}Excuse me.
{33835}{33958}I'm just as curious as the next scientist,|but that would be completely irresponsible.
{33993}{34043}This is not what I set out to do.
{34045}{34118}It's a byproduct,|I'd like to keep it that way.
{34355}{34378}Okay.
{34490}{34578}Thanks a lot for your time.|I appreciate it, Dr. Briggs.
{34662}{34707}Good luck with everything.
{34727}{34753}Thanks.
{35102}{35156}- Good morning, George.|- Morning, Dr. Krane.
{35158}{35212}- How are you?|- Fine, thank you.
{35218}{35268}- Is that from the pharmacy?|- Yeah.
{35270}{35368}Nasty. I heard he shot a girl in the face.|Is that true?
{35399}{35438}A real model citizen.
{36778}{36838}- Dr. Krane?|- Yeah, George?
{36924}{36976}I was just checking some numbers.
{36978}{37078}- It's cold in here. I could lend you a coat.|- No, I'm done.
{46074}{46101}Mary?
{47818}{47872}{y:i}You'll never catch me alive.
{48087}{48132}{y:i}... that we've exchanged this day.
{48151}{48263}{y:i}Now, by the power that's vested in me|{y:i}by the state and the church...
{51088}{51121}Dr. Krane.
{51161}{51218}- Are you okay?|- Yes, I'm fine.
{51220}{51280}Do you mind if I don't sign in?|I'm onto something.
{51281}{51327}You know I can't do that.
{51373}{51399}Look.
{51415}{51454}Just help me out here.
{51510}{51579}- Is that what I think it is?|- Yeah.
{51581}{51629}I could take a lot of heat for that.
{51633}{51742}Only if somebody finds out. And they're|not going to find out unless you tell them.
{51743}{51793}Come on, please.
{51882}{51926}I gotta visit the head.
{51946}{52016}Anybody shows, you're on your own.
{52043}{52072}Thanks.
{58373}{58425}No, his face is too round.
{58431}{58481}It was much more narrow.
{58487}{58556}Don't worry.|Focus on the eyes and the rest will follow.
{58558}{58629}They don't seem right either.|They're too...
{58713}{58750}Let me just...
{58850}{58949}The eyes are much more like this.
{59200}{59257}There. Those are the eyes.
{59452}{59498}I didn't know you could draw.
{59626}{59714}Donna Berman. Seattle Art Institute.
{59893}{59918}Thanks, Jeff.
{60379}{60410}Watch this.
{61461}{61495}Are you okay?
{61529}{61570}You're bleeding.
{61776}{61822}Maybe you should see a doctor.
{61830}{61882}Could you send that out for an ID?
{61898}{61980}Are you kidding?|I could book him on the "Queen Mary".
{61988}{62012}Gone.
{62019}{62046}Thanks.
{62206}{62304}I'm missing a vial of my formula,|and I know you have it.
{62306}{62344}I was gonna call you.
{62346}{62396}- Where is it?|- Just wait.
{62398}{62455}- You've had nosebleeds?|- Hi, Dr. Stratton.
{62477}{62559}Avery tells me you haven't finished|the pharmacy paperwork.
{62573}{62610}I'm running a little late.
{62612}{62686}- I need it on my desk by noon.|- Okay.
{62894}{62927}It works.
{62950}{63031}It was the most amazing thing|I ever experienced.
{63035}{63143}I took the nitroglycerine orally to counter|the side effects of the norepinephrine.
{63207}{63233}Where is it?
{63296}{63332}I used it all.
{63351}{63379}Twelve cc's?
{63415}{63440}Yeah.
{63514}{63606}I trusted you.|You had no right to take it from me!
{63614}{63687}You're right.|I took something, and I'm sorry.
{63714}{63801}But look what I've given you in return.|Your first human trial.
{63803}{63840}Who do you think you are?
{63877}{63939}You could have died. You had no right.
{63941}{63991}Aren't you even the least bit curious?
{64046}{64135}You created something incredible.|Do you know what I saw?
{64152}{64220}It's not what you thought.|It's not like memory.
{64226}{64316}It's more than that.|It was like a raw experience.
{64341}{64413}Like the past is present.|Like I was actually there.
{64418}{64467}Do you know murders can be solved?
{64469}{64534}Questions can be answered.
{64544}{64604}This is about your wife, isn't it?
{64648}{64701}You took her CSF, didn't you?
{64786}{64846}You have no idea|what you've done to yourself.
{64850}{64961}I have no idea. I haven't even completed|side-effect research on my rats.
{64984}{65097}I'm telling you that your formula works,|and you're talking to me about rats.
{65305}{65331}Okay.
{65414}{65457}I want you in my lab.
{65459}{65582}I need full blood work,|an EKG, full respiratory.
{65602}{65711}And a brain scan wouldn't be a bad idea,|just to make sure you have one.
{65744}{65782}It's not funny.
{65873}{65970}All right, I'll be by this afternoon.|Let me just finish this paperwork.
{65972}{66008}How about right now, Doctor?
{66078}{66133}No bruits. Regular rate and rhythm.
{66149}{66217}No murmurs, rubs or extra heart sounds.
{66229}{66266}And the lungs are clear.
{66715}{66763}There's been some damage.
{66906}{66950}I can live with that.
{66961}{67067}You can live with that? You've done|significant damage to your heart.
{67081}{67114}It's my heart.
{67119}{67218}It's my experiment.|If somebody finds out about this...
{67246}{67295}You're right. I'm sorry.
{67306}{67365}If there was another way,|I would have done it.
{67372}{67422}But what's done is done.
{67445}{67536}- Nobody will find out unless you tell them.|- Or unless you die.
{67542}{67588}I'm not gonna die.
{67613}{67670}Even if I did, they'd never link it to you.
{67672}{67784}Most MEs won't find foreign matter|unless they're told to look for it.
{67799}{67842}I can keep a secret, can you?
{68036}{68118}- Where's your phone?|- In there.
{68315}{68343}Avery, it's me.
{68345}{68406}They already found a match|on your drawing.
{68412}{68448}{y:i}This equipment is incredible.
{68449}{68506}- What's his name?|- Eddie Dutton.
{68508}{68597}This guy has a lovely résumé.|Listen to this.
{68600}{68679}Drugs, grand theft, aggravated assault.
{68684}{68773}They even tried to nail him on those|contract hits in Chinatown last year.
{68780}{68880}- What's his last known address?|{y:i}- 25 Hastings, Dodson Hotel.
{68882}{68920}{y:i}He lived with his girlfriend.
{68922}{69027}Okay. Call Bresler and tell him|that Dutton is the pharmacy shooter.
{69047}{69106}What should I say when he stops laughing?
{69107}{69166}{y:i}Tell him you ID'd him from the candy bar.
{69167}{69218}But I haven't. We're waiting to hear.
{69220}{69271}Please, you've gotta help me out.
{69273}{69333}Look, that's not confirmed. I can't put my...
{69335}{69388}Please, just do it for me.
{69407}{69447}All right, David.
{69467}{69517}But this time it's your ass.
{69572}{69602}I gotta go.
{69604}{69649}- No, you don't.|- I've got work to do.
{69650}{69708}You're not leaving my sight|for the next 48 hours.
{69710}{69751}I can't stay here.
{69792}{69841}Okay, I'll go with you.
{69865}{69895}- No.|- Yes.
{69897}{69923}Wait a minute.
{69925}{69992}You're the one who made yourself|part of my experiment.
{69994}{70033}I don't have time for this.
{70035}{70097}If you leave without me I'll call the police.
{70311}{70370}- Must you drive so fast?|- Yes.
{70400}{70440}It's part of my job.
{70609}{70720}1:00 p.m. Subject appears irritable,|anxious and tense.
{71062}{71141}- Stay with the car.|- Where are you going?
{71944}{71973}Hang on.
{72073}{72110}- Are you the manager?|- Yeah.
{72112}{72167}I'm with the Seattle|Medical Examiner's Office.
{72169}{72219}I'm looking for a guy named Eddie Dutton.
{72220}{72293}- Do you know where I could find him?|- Are you a cop?
{72295}{72330}No, I'm with the Seattle...
{72374}{72399}Damn it.
{72904}{72957}What are you staring at?
{73029}{73107}Fuckin' fag.|What are you looking at me like that for?
{73117}{73160}Are you a pretty boy?
{73173}{73220}Get out of here, you fuckin'...
{73876}{73901}Sorry.
{74548}{74583}David, you have to stop!
{74594}{74670}- Your heart! It's extremely weak.|- Get lost!
{74675}{74702}You have to stop.
{75008}{75035}Shit.
{75101}{75187}What the fuck do you think you're doing?|Get out of the fuckin' truck.
{75202}{75283}- You fucked up my car.|- I'm sorry. It was just an accident.
{75285}{75359}You can't see a fuckin'|parked car on the street?
{75361}{75422}I said I was sorry.|What do you want me to do?
{75424}{75499}- Are you okay?|- Get your fuckin' wallet out of the car.
{75501}{75550}- Martha Briggs.|- Fuck you.
{75943}{75971}Okay.
{76209}{76276}- You are fuckin' lucky.|- Move the car!
{80553}{80655}We know the way we would|like to reason...
{80677}{80766}...but all too often it leads to change.
{80797}{80897}And it's how we react to this change...
{81003}{81035}Let him go!
{81059}{81083}Put him down.
{81109}{81132}Put him down!
{81134}{81222}Back off right now, or I'm going to cut him.
{81234}{81270}Please, he's only a child.
{81272}{81303}Back off!
{81315}{81345}You don't think I'll cut him?
{81555}{81606}I'll fucking cut him like a fish.
{81635}{81690}Right through the guts, man. Back off.
{81733}{81779}Call the dogs off, man.
{81796}{81842}Fuck off! Back up!
{81851}{81900}Put the knife down.
{81919}{82038}Call your dogs off right now,|or I'm going to cut him.
{82044}{82109}Please, put the gun down.
{82131}{82198}Yeah, put the gun down. Come on, man.
{82215}{82269}Put the gun down now!
{82373}{82411}Put them down!
{82574}{82639}- What's it gonna be?|- Take it easy.
{82653}{82750}I don't give a fuck anymore.|Get me a car, or this boy is gonna die.
{82766}{82796}Stop moving, man.
{82820}{82854}Back up, man.
{82880}{82947}Nobody's listening to me! Back up!
{82958}{82992}Put the kid down.
{82995}{83036}I'm gonna run this boy.
{83055}{83080}Eddie.
{83116}{83139}No!
{83325}{83352}Get off!
{83368}{83415}Stay back. Nobody move!
{83453}{83490}Aw, shit.
{83520}{83588}Jesus, Krane! What are you doing here?
{83625}{83668}I was following a lead.
{83675}{83704}Lead?
{83726}{83814}You're way out of bounds, Krane.|This isn't the fucking Coroner's Office.
{83816}{83874}Get up! Tell me that again.
{83900}{83986}I was following a lead.|He was getting away. That's his gun.
{83998}{84098}Is that right? I think you've seen|one too many episodes of "Quincy".
{84114}{84139}It's over.
{84176}{84240}Keep this up, you'll get yourself killed.
{84456}{84500}Is that the guy?
{84629}{84678}I guess I'll never know.
{84777}{84818}Get this guy out of here.
{85837}{85877}Are you all right?
{85993}{86022}David?
{86029}{86065}Could we talk?
{86095}{86189}- Could you excuse us, please?|- I'll wait outside.
{86277}{86343}You went behind my back|for the saliva test.
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is now ready for boarding at--
Inmate number 87645--
Cole, James.
-Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.
- Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.
Maybe they'll give you a pardon, man.
Yeah. That's why none of the volunteers come back. They all get a pardon.
Some come back, I heard.
Please put me back!
Don't take me!
They got 'em up on the seventh floor.
They hide 'em up there.
They're all messed up in the head.
You don't know they're all messed up.
Nobody's seen 'em.
And maybe they're not messed up.
That's a rumour. Nobody knows that.
I don't believe that.
Good luck, man.
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn't volunteer.
You causing trouble again?
No, no trouble.
These are the instructions
for the first time probe.
Listen carefully.
They must be followed exactly.
All openings of your garment
must be sealed completely.
If the integrity of the suit
is compromised in any way...
if the fabric is torn
or a zipper not closed...
readmittance will be denied.
If there are any indications
of contamination by germs...
the subject will be denied
re-entry to secure population.
Please place blood sample
in receptacle provided.
There will be a socialization
class in room 700...
for citizens cited
for deviations 23-A and 96-A...
per Subchapter 6
of the Permanent Emergency Code.
James Cole cleared from quarantine.
Thank you.
You two wait outside.
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.
Antisocial six.
Repeated violations of the Permanent Emergency Code.
Insolence. Defiance.
Disregard of authority.
Doing 25 to life.
I don't think he's gonna hurt us.
You aren't gonna hurt us, are you, Mr Cole?
No, sir.
Why don't you sit down,
Mr Cole?
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.
- Thank you.
- We have a very advanced programme.
- Something very different.
- A chance to reduce your sentence.
And possibly play an important role... in returning the human race to the surface of the Earth.
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.
We've had some misfortunes with unstable types.
For a man in your position, an opportunity.
Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.
Definitely a mistake.
"Yet among the myriad microwaves... the infrared messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeros... we find words, byte-sized now... tinier even than science... lurking in some vague electricity.
But if we but listen... we hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us... yesterday this day's madness did prepare... tomorrow's silent triumph of despair.
Drink, for you know not whence you came, nor why.
Drink, for you know not why you go, nor where.''
Wandering around in nothing but his underpants... and one of those plastic, see-through lady's raincoats.
So, they get there, they ask the guy real nice for some kind of ID.
He gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
Totally irrational, totally disoriented.
Doesn't know where he is, what day of the week it is.
All they got was his name.
They figured he's stoned out of his mind. Some kind of psychotic episode.
- He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.
But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.
- No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.
Yeah. Weren't you listenin'? I've got two police officers in the hospital!
The medic gave him enough Stelazine to kill a horse. He's rarin' to go.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
The struggle.
Yeah. You wanna go in there, examine him?
Yes, please.
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?
No match-up. No licence, no prints, no warrants. Nothing.
- I should probably go in with you.
- No, thank you.
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.
He'll be right here, just in case.
Mr Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist.
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.
So my concern is for your well-being.
Do you understand that?
Need to go!
Need to go!
I can't make the police let you go.
But I do wanna help you, so l--
I need you to tell me exactly what happened tonight.
Do you think you can do that,James?
May I call you James?
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.
- Have you been a patient at County?
- No.
- Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.
I need to go! I'm supposed to be gathering information.
- What kind of information?
- Won't help you.
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.
James, do you know why you're here?
'Cause I'm a good observer.
I've got a tough mind.
You don't remember assaulting a police officer?
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?
You've been in an institution before, haven't you?
- Or hospital?
- No! Now I need to go. Need to go!
- Have you been in prison,James?
- Underground.
Hiding?
I love this air.
Oh, it's such wonderful air.
- What's wonderful about the air,James?
- Very fresh. No germs.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air?
- This is October, right?
- April.
- What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?
That's the future,James. Do you think you're living in the future?
1996 is the past.
No, 1996 is the future.
This is 1990.
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where're you taking me?
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.
I can't go to France. I just need to make a telephone call.
Yeah, yeah. Zip it, Daisy. You fooled the shrink, but you don't fool us.
Let's go, ace.
All right.
Come on, come on.
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head,Jimbo.
- See if you got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.
Got to get to a doctor,Jimbo. Can't make no calls till the doctor says.
It's very important!
What you gotta do,Jimbo, is take it easy. Relax into things.
And we'll all get along fine if you just relax.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Goines!
Yo, Goines!
Yo,Jeffrey!
- What?
- Look here.
This here's James. Now, do me a favour.
Why don't you show him around?
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.
- Five thousand dollars. That enough?
- Five thousand?
I'll wire a cheque to your account as usual.
I'll give him the deluxe mental hospital tour.
Kid around, makes 'em feel good.
We're pals.
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.
Now you got it.
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.
And there's--
Get out! Get out!
He was in my chair.
Games. Games.
Here's some games.
Games that wanna get out.
See? More games.
Games, they vegetize you.
See?
If you play the games, you're voluntarily taking a tranquillizer.
I guess they gave you some chemical restraints. Drugs!
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?
Learn your drugs. Know your dosages.
It's elementary.
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?
That's communication with the outside world. Doctor's discretion.
If all of these nuts could just make phone calls... it could spread insanity oozing through telephone cables... oozing to the ears of all these poor, sane people, infecting them.
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.
In fact, very few,Jim--Jim, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.
I'm not saying you're not mentally ill.
For all I know, you're crazy as a loon.
But that's not why you're here.
You're here because of the system.
There's the television.
It's all right there.
All right there.
Look, listen, kneel, pray.
The commercials!
We're not productive any more.
Don't make things. It's all automated.
What are we for then?
We're consumers,Jim.
Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, what are you then?
What?
You're mentally ill.
Fact,Jim. Fact! If you don't buy things: toilet paper, new cars... electrically operated sexual devices... stereo systems with brain-implanted headphones... screwdrivers with built-in radar devices, voice-activated computers--
Take it easy,Jeffrey.
Be calm!
Right. That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.
If you want to watch a particular
TV programme, like All My Children... go to the nurse, tell her the day, the time the show you wanna see is on.
But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on.
This guy was always requesting shows that had already played.
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.
He couldn't grasp the idea that the nurse couldn't make it be yesterday.
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake,Jim.
Okay, that's it,Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.
- I warned you.
- Right.
I got a little carried away... explaining the inner workings of the institution to Jim.
I don't really come from outer space.
Oh. L.J. Washington.
He doesn't really come from outer space.
Don't mock me, my friend.
Get outta my chair!
It's a condition of mental divergence.
I find myself on the planet Ogo.
Part of an intellectual elite... preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on Pluto.
But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in all ways... nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche.
I am mentally divergent... in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities... that plague my life here.
When I stop going there,
I will be well.
Are you also divergent, friend?
This is a place for crazy people.
I'm not crazy.
We don't use that term, " crazy,''
Mr Cole.
You've got some real nuts here!
I know some things that you don't know.
It's gonna be very difficult for you to understand it.
I'm not gonna hurt anyone!
All right.
Look, have any of you heard... of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
They stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere.
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?
Why don't you just take your time... and try to explain this from the beginning?
Right, right.
It's 1990.
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn't have been active yet.
Five billion people died in 1996 and 1997.
Almost the entire population of the world.
Only about one percent of us survived.
- Are you going to save us?
- How can I? This already happened.
I can't save you.
Nobody can.
I am simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present... trace the path of the virus.
We're not in the present now,
Mr Cole?
1990 is the past. This already happened.
That's what I'm trying--
You believe 1996 is the present then, is that it?
No! 1996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What l--
What l-- What I need to do is make a telephone call.
I can straighten this out if I make a telephone call.
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?
The scientists. They'll want to know that they sent me to the wrong time.
I can leave a voice mail message that they monitor from the present.
Can I just make one telephone call, please?
Please?
What are you doin' in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!
Who put those Doritos in there anyway?
Yes? What?
Voice mail?
Look, I don't know--
Stop makin' that noise!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.
Duanne, get out--
James who?
Wasn't who you expected?
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.
Well, maybe it was the wrong number.
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.
James, where did you grow up?
Dr Railly.
I have the strangest feeling
I've met you before.
Wait. This is 1990. I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1996!
It's not the right number yet!
That's the problem!
I have a message for them.
Won't work.
Can't open it.
You think you can remove the grill, but you can't. It's welded.
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.
They're protecting the people on the outside from us... when the people on the outside are as crazy as us.
Do you know what " crazy'' is?
Crazy is " majority rules.'' Yeah.
Take germs, for example.
Germs?
In the 18th century, no such thing.
Nada. Nothing.
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person, anyway.
Along comes this doctor.
Semmelweis!
Semmelweis comes along, trying to convince people, other doctors mainly... that there are these teeny, tiny, invisible bad things called germs... that get into your body and make you sick.
He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.
What is this guy?
Crazy?
Teeny, tiny, invisible--
"What do you call 'em? Germs? What?''
Now, cut to the 20th century.
Last week, in fact, right before
I got dragged into this hellhole!
I go in to order a burger in this fast-food joint.
The guy drops it on the floor.
Jim, he picks it up, wipes it off.
He hands it to me like it was all okay.
"What about the germs?'' I say.
He says, "I don't believe in germs.
Germs are a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soaps.''
Now, he's crazy, right?
See?
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.
You, you, you believe in germs, right?
I'm not crazy.
Of course not! You wanna escape, right?
That's very sane.
I can help you.
You want me to, don't ya? Get you out?
You know how to get outta here?
Yes, my son!
- Then why don't ya?
- Why don't I try to escape?
Good question. Very good question.
Intelligent.
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits... secretaries of secretaries and other assorted minions... who will contact my father.
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place... he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints... where they treat you properly, like a person, a guest!
With sheets and towels like a big hotel... with great drugs for all of us nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils!
Sorry. Sorry.
I got a little agitated.
The thought of escape crossed my mind.
And suddenly--
Suddenly I felt like bending the fucking bars back!
And ripping out the window frames and eating them! Yes, eating them!
And leaping, leaping, leaping!
Colonics for everyone!
I'm a mental patient.
I'm supposed to act out.
Wait'll you morons find out who I am!
My father's gonna be really upset.
And when my father gets upset, the ground shakes.
My father is God!
I worship my father!
These dramatic video tapes, secretly
obtained by animal rights activists...
have aroused public indignation.
But many scientists
vehemently disagree.
Torture experiments.
- We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?
Not as bad as what they're doing to the Easter Bunny.
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.
Maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out.
Wiping out the human race?
It's a great idea.
It's great.
But more of a long-term thing.
First we have to focus on more immediate goals.
I didn't say a word about you-know-what.
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.
What are you writing?
You a reporter?
It's private.
A lawsuit?
You gonna sue 'em?
Yo,Jimbo.
Time for your meds.
Take a chance.
Live the moment.
Sunshine.
Gorgeous beaches.
The Florida Keys!
We'll return you to the Marx Brothers
in Monkey Business.
Monkey business!
Fetch!
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.
What?
If you see a bearish future
in the decade ahead...
consider the changes sweeping the world
and the opportunities they offer.
" And the opportunities they offer.'' Ooh!
They really dosed you.
Jim!
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.
Remember the plan.
I did my part!
What?
Not " what.'' When.
- When?
- Yes. When.
Now. Now,Jim.
Yes! Now!
Buy! Sell!
Stocks! Bonds!
Purchase! Sell!
Yes!
No more monkey business!
No... more... monkey business!
Yes, enhance your portfolio now.
Five hundred dollars.
I got $500. I'm insured!
Yeah! A window of opportunity is opening now.
Now is the time for all good men to seize the moment. The moment!
Now is the time for all good men to seize the day!
Goddam it,Jeffrey!
Quit playin' the fool!
MasterCard!
Visa!
The key to happiness!
Jim, seize the moment!
Jeffrey, come back here!
Go,Jim!
- Get out. Out!
- Come here,Jeffrey!
The future can be yours!
Last chance! Last chance!
Best place to go would be Florida.
The Keys are lovely this time of year.
Two's not working today.
Use one.
Kathryn, this was in my box!
But I have a slight suspicion it wasn't meant for me.
"You are the most bootiful woman I have ever seen.
You live in a bootiful world, but you don't know it.
You have freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe--''
James Cole, right?
"I would do anything to stay here but I must leave. Please help me.''
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one of yours, right?
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.
Shit!
We have to know exactly what's there so we can fix it.
Doctor, we have a visitor.
May I help you?
Excuse me?
Hey,Jimbo.
What's up, man?
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.
- It'll be all right.
- Take care.
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?
Send you back to your room. A little milk and cookies, you'll be all right.
Just take it easy, okay?
Calm down!
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr Railly, help me, please.
- We'll give you something to calm you.
- No! No more drugs!
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.
Kathryn, we've been working together for four years.
I've never seen you like this before.
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactly what--
He should've been in restraints.
It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. Why not own up to it?
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him.
- I've seen him before and I'm trying--
- Two policemen are in the hospital.
Now we've got a security guard with a skull fracture.
I said it was bad judgment!
What else do you want me to say?
You see that?
See what I mean?
You're being defensive.
Isn't she being defensive?
We have another situation.
- He was fully restrained?
- Yes, sir. I did it myself.
And he was fully sedated?
He was fully sedated.
Are you trying to tell me a fully sedated, fully restrained patient... somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him... and is wriggling his way through the ventilation system?
Watch it!
You sure fucked up!
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!
My name's not Bob.
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?
- Where are you?
- Another cell.
Maybe.
What do you mean " maybe''?
What's that supposed to mean?
Maybe means... maybe I'm in the next cell.
Another volunteer like you.
Or maybe I'm in the Central Office... spying on ya for all those science bozos.
Or, hey... maybe I'm not even here.
Maybe I'm just in your head.
No way to confirm anything.
- Where'd they send ya?
'90! How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?
Hey, Bob, you do the job?
You find out the big info?
Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
It was supposed to be 1996.
Science ain't an exact science with these clowns.
But they're getting better.
You're lucky you didn't end up in ancient Egypt.
Shh! They're comin'.
The Freedom for Animals Association
on Second Avenue...
is the secret headquarters
of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They are the ones
who are going to do it.
I can't do any more.
I have to go now.
Have a merry Christmas.
- Well?
- What?
Did you or did you not record that message?
It's a reconstruction of a deteriorated recording.
Weak signal. We have to put them together one word at a time.
We just finished rebuilding this.
Did you or did you not make this call?
I couldn't make any call. You sent me to the wrong year. It was 1990.
- You're certain of that?
- What'd you do with your time, Cole?
Did you waste it on drugs?
Women?
- They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?
Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I was in trouble.
I got arrested.
I did what you wanted.
I got a specimen, a spider.
I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.
But you sent me to the wrong year, so it really doesn't matter.
Did you see this when you went back?
No, sir, I don't think so.
What about these people?
Did you see any of these people?
No.
Oh, wait, wait.
Him?
You saw that man?
Maybe in the mental institution.
You were in a mental institution?
Oh, God.
Cole, you were sent back to make some very important observations.
You could've made a real contribution.
Helped us to reclaim the planet.
As well as reducing your sentence.
The question is, Cole, do you want another chance?
Last connection going on.
No mistakes this time, Cole.
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.
We're thinking about the spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.
We're sending you to the third quarter of 1996.
Right on the money.
I don't understand!
What?
I don't understand!
- Where am I?
- I gotta find 'em! I gotta find 'em!
Help me!
I don't know where I am.
- You gotta help me find 'em!
-Jose?
-Jose!
- Cole!
Cole, where are we?
- Help me, Cole!
- Oh, God, wait!
"In a season of great pestilence...
there are omens and divinations.
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels... seven golden vials full of the wrath of God... who liveth forever and ever.''
Revelations.
In the 14th century, according to accounts of officials of that time... this man appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle near Stonehenge... in April of 1362.
Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent... the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence... which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years.
Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling... when reality supports it with a virulent disease... whether it's the bubonic plague, small pox or AIDS.
Now we have technological horrors as well... such as chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head... during the deadly mustard gas attacks of World War I.
During such an attack in the French trenches in October of 1917... we have an account of this soldier... who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel... and hospitalized, apparently in a state of hysteria.
Doctors found he had lost all comprehension of French... but that he spoke English fluently... albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize.
The man, though physically unaffected by the gas... was beside himself.
He claimed that he had come from the future... that he was looking for a pure germ... that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the Earth... starting in the year 1996.
Though injured, the young soldier disappeared from the hospital... no doubt trying to carry on his mission to warn others... and substituting for the agony of war... a self-inflicted agony we call "the Cassandra complex."
Cassandra, in Greek legend, was condemned to know the future... but to be disbelieved when she foretold it.
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge, plus the impotence to do anything about it.
I'm going right out to get vaccinated.
I think, Dr Railly, you've given alarmists a bad name.
I have?
There's real data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race.
- This is true.
- Proliferation of atomic devices.
Uncontrolled breeding habits.
Pollution of land, sea and air.
The rape of the environment.
In this context, it's obvious Chicken
Little represents the sane vision... and that Homo sapiens' motto,
"Let's go shopping" ... is the cry of the true lunatic.
Please, Dr Railly. I wonder if you're aware of my own studies.
See you at work tomorrow.
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
Get in the car!
I've got a gun. Get in the car.
Drive.
Take my purse.
I've got a lot of cash, credit cards.
- Take my keys.
- Start the car!
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.
- Where are we going?
- Philadelphia.
- That's more than a hundred miles.
- That's why I can't walk there.
-Just let me go.
-Just drive!
- You can take the car.
- I don't know how to drive.
I went underground when I was eight.
I told you that before.
At the next--
- At the next corner, turn right.
- Cole.James Cole.
You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
Six years for you.
Come on.
Turn around! Get goin'.
I can't believe that this is a coincidence, Mr Cole.
- Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.
I know this isn't what you meant, but...
I don't have any money.
I hurt my leg.
I've been sleeping on the street.
I'm sure I smell bad.
Do you have any food in this car?
- You have been following me?
- No.
No, I saw this... in a store window.
I can read, remember?
Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.
It's in Philadelphia.
That's where the ones who did it are.
The Twelve Monkeys.
Is that a radio?
Can you turn it on?
This is a personal message to you.
Are you at the end of your rope?
Are you dying to get away?
The Florida Keys are waiting for you.
Ocean waves--
I've never seen the ocean.
It's an advertisement, Mr Cole.
What?
It's an advertisement.
You understand that, don't you?
It's not really a special message to you.
Mr Cole.
- You used to call me James.
- You prefer that?
James, you don't really have a gun--
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?
I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you
I love the music of the 20th century.
I love this air.
Love to breathe this air!
WXBX news break.
News as it happens.
Roger Pratt reporting.
A story breaking now is emergency crews
are converging on a corn field...
where playmates of nine-year-old
Ricky Neuman say...
he disappeared before their eyes.
Young Neuman apparently stepped
into an abandoned well shaft...
and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 150-foot pipe.
Possibly alive, possibly badly injured,
playmates heard him cry out faintly.
- Never cry wolf.
- What?
My father said that to me.
He said, "Never cry wolf."
Then people won't believe you if something really happens.
If something really happens like what,James?
Something bad.
Can we have some more music, please?
I don't wanna hear this stuff.
Can we hear more music?
- I see trees of green
- Oh, that's good. That's good.
I've seen them bloom
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Hello, Dr Railly?
This is Wikke from Psych Admitting.
Do you rememberJames Cole?
The paranoid who pulled
the Houdini back in '90?
Well, he's back, and he's--
Sorry about that. He's looking for you.
I thought you oughta know.
Take care.
It's just like I told you.
Me and my husband went ahead.
I don't know. She never showed.
That is totally unlike her.
Do you happen to know the make of her car?
Cherokee. '94 Cherokee.
Silver.
I have done " doed" it, ja.
I, Professor Grossenfibber,
have invented the time tunnel!
Oh, boy!
Oh, excuse me, mister.
Have a cigar.
Excuse me, mister.
Have a cigar.
Now my time machine
is ready for experiments.
Ah, the woodpecker!
Yoo-hoo, woodpecker!
You were in my dream just now.
Hair is different.
Different colour.
I'm sure it was you.
What was the dream about?
About an airport... before everything happened.
It's the same dream
I always have.
When I was a kid.
And I was in it?
What did I do?
You were very upset.
You're always very upset in the dream.
Just never knew it was you.
It wasn't me before,James.
It's become me now because of what's happening.
Could you please untie me?
No, I think it was always you.
Very strange.
You're flushed and you were moaning.
I think you're running a fever.
What are you doing?
In Fresno, California, crews continue
to attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman.
Closer to home, in Baltimore,
Kathryn Railly...
prominent psychiatrist and author of
a newly released book on insanity...
disappeared mysteriously last night
after a lecture at the university.
Former mental patient James Cole
is wanted for questioning...
regarding Dr Railly's disappearance.
Authorities warn that Cole
has a history of violence...
and advise anyone spotting him
to notify authorities at once.
I love this music.
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.
What are all those?
These?
My notes, clues.
What kind of clues?
It's about the secret army.
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones that spread the virus.
That's why I'm here.
I have to find them. That's my mission.
Have to locate them because they have the virus in its pure form... before it mutates.
When I locate them, they'll send a scientist back here.
That scientist will study the virus.
When he goes back to the present, he and the scientists will make a cure.
Police officers
from threejurisdictions...
apparently including
special tactical unit personnel...
have now been mobilized to control
the growing thousands of onlookers...
here in Fresno, California.
Does that disturb you?
No. Thought it was about us.
Thought maybe they'd captured us and arrested me.
Just a joke.
I remember being very afraid for that little boy.
All alone, down that well... not knowing if anybody's gonna get him out.
First time I was really afraid when I was a kid.
What do you mean,
"when you were a kid" ?
Never mind.
Just a prank, a hoax.
That boy's hiding in a barn.
"There are omens and divinations.
One of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels... seven golden vials full of the wrath of God... who liveth forever and ever.''
You won't think I'm crazy when people start dying next month.
First they'll think it's just some weird fever.
Then they'll find out.
They'll catch on.
Wait. Stop here! Stop the car!
Stop right here!
I was right. They're here!
You see? Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys!
You believe me now?
Come on!
Come on!
They're here, you see?
Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys. Come on!
Twelve Monkeys.
Wait, wait. Wait, here.
Here, do you see it?
Do you see?
I see some red paint, some marks.
- Marks? You think that--
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
Don't--
Don't you do anything crazy.
Or I'll hurt somebody.
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but none of this is what you think it is!
You can't hide from them, Bob.
I said, you can't hide from them.
No, sir, ol' Bob.
Don't even try.
They hear everything.
They got that tracking device on ya.
They can find you anywhere, anytime!
It's in the tooth.
Right, Bob?
But I fooled 'em, old buddy.
They don't have to spy on me.
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.
You see? Here it is again. See?
Here, follow this paint trail.
Here. It's here, see?
I am not going--
Come with me!
The paint trail goes here.
Let go of my arm!
James, we shouldn't be here.
Goddam it!
Leave me alone!
Let's get out of here.
James, we shouldn't be here.
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me, don't kill me!
Stick around, bitch.
Are you all right?
Is he alive?
Go ahead.
We're runnin' out of time.
- You can't help him.
- Oh,Jesus!
James, you killed him!
All I see are dead people.
Come on.
- Come on.
- You never had a gun before!
I have one now.
Come on. Come on!
"Dragons in their pleasant palaces.
The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air... and there came--''
You!
You're one of us.
This is it.
Come on.
Can we help you?
It's just a tape.
I'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
We don't know anything about an Army of the Twelve Monkeys so just disappear.
-Just want some information.
- Didn't you hear me?
Don't hurt her!
Please, I'm a psychiatrist.
Just do whatever he tells you to do.
He's disturbed. He's dangerous.
- Please just cooperate.
- You want money?
- We only got a few bucks.
- I told you what I want.
Get down. Lock that door.
Lock it now!
- I told you that Goines would get us--
- Shut up!
- Goines?
-Jeffrey Goines?
Jeffrey becomes this big star, and the media latch onto him... because he's picketing his own father... a famous
Nobel-prize-winning virologist.
You must have seen all that on TV.
I don't watch TV.
Is this him?
Yeah, that's him, that's him.
What are you gonna do to us?
Tell me more about Jeffrey.
Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do-- picketing, leafleting, letter-writing stuff.
He said we were ineffectual, liberal jerk-offs.
He wanted to do guerrilla actions in order to educate the public.
- Like this?
- He let 100 snakes loose in the Senate.
But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
It's counterproductive. We told him.
So he and 11 guys, they split off... and formed this underground army.
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
See?
They started planning a"human hunt."
They bought stun guns, nets and bear traps.
They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers.
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any of it.
Like always, Mr Big Shot sold his friends out.
What does that mean?
He goes on TV and gives this big news conference, tells the world... he just realized his dad's experiments are vital for humanity... and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary... that from now on, he,Jeffrey Goines, will personally supervise the labs... to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer.
What is this?
People like that aren't accessible.
You can't just barge in on them.
- It's not how the world works.
- Be quiet and drive the car.
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't.
This car is stolen, and we are in big trouble.
Big trouble.
If you don't turn yourself over to the police, they're going to kill you.
They're going to shoot me, too, because I'm an accessory to murder.
- You're all going to die.
- Nobody is going to die.
You're not going to save the world, okay? You're delusional.
You've made all this up out of bits and pieces in your head.
- No.
- Yes!
Let me give you an example.
You know Jeffrey Goines. You were both patients at County Hospital.
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.
He told you that his father was a famous scientist who worked with viruses... so you incorporated that information to this cockeyed fantasy.
He didn't say his father was a scientist. He said his father was God.
This is insane.
Prominent psychiatrist and author
Dr Kathryn Railly has been abducted...
by a dangerous mental patient,
James Cole.
Cole was under Railly's care
six years ago...
when he made
a dramatic escape--
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.
Shot?
Who shot you?
I don't know.
It was some kind of war. Never mind.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
What are you doing?
-We don't need gas.
-I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.
This can't go on.
If you have a bullet in your leg,
I have to take care of it.
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.
Meanwhile,
in Fresno, California...
where mining engineers
continue their attempt...
to sink a shaft parallel to the one
in which Ricky is believed trapped...
authorities say there is still a chance
the boy might be alive.
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.
Lucky for you, it's near the surface.
I love seeing the sun.
Wait.
Let me help you.
You smell so good.
You have to give yourself up.
You know that?
What are you doing? James?
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
Let go of me!
- They find him?
- Who?
- That kid, the one in the pipe.
- You believe that?
They're lowering a monkey down there... with an infrared camera strapped on him... and a roast beef sandwich wrapped up in tin foil.
- You're makin' it up.
- I shit you not, man.
- Life is really weird.
- A monkey and a roast beef sandwich.
Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner... and this most stimulating and exciting company... for itself, with no sense of purpose.
But, alas, I am burdened.
For with all this excess of public attention and cacophony of praise... there comes great responsibility.
I don't have to tell you all that the dangers of science... are a timeworn threat.
From Prometheus stealing fire from the gods--
What friend?
I'm not expecting anyone.
But never before--
This is ridiculous.
My father's giving a major address.
...to fear the power... we have at hand.
Normally, if we caught a guy... sneaking around with no ID, we'd bust his ass.
Excuse my French.
This one says he knows you.
Since you seem to have had a few unusual associates... we certainly would not want to arrest one of your closest pals.
Never seen him before in my life.
Feel free to torture this man, or whatever it is you do.
I'm going back to listen to my father's eloquent discourse on the perils of--
I'm here about some monkeys.
- Monkeys?
- Monkeys, yes.
Twelve of them.
Arnold.
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?
Of course I know this man.
Arnold Pettibone.
Gee, Arnie, it's black tie.
I said, "Drop by."
But it's Dad's big do--
VIPs, senators, secret service.
You hungry, Arnie?
Real killer feast we're putting on.
Lots of dead lamb, dead cow, dead pig.
Shall we?
Hi. How are you? Hello.
Very attractive.
"The Great Escape," 1990.
Watch it! Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?
I can't do anything about what you're going to do.
I can't change anything.
I won't stop you. I can't stop you.
- I just want the information.
- Come on.
Hi, ladies. So nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.
All right. Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?
I just want access to the pure virus.
- Virus?
- I need to know where and what it is.
I get it. I see what you're up to.
It's your old plan, isn't it?
- What plan?
- Your plan.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do.
We were in the day room watching television... and you were upset about the desecration of the planet, which I understand.
Then you said, "Wouldn't it be great to have a germ or virus... that would wipe out mankind and leave the animals and trees?''
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.
I told you my father was this famous virologist.
You said, "He could make a germ, and we could steal it."
- You were so funny.
- They mutate! We live underground!
The world belongs to the dogs and cats.
We live like worms.
I just need the information!
-Take it easy.
-You are a nutcase, completely deranged!
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.
Your information tray is jammed, man.
Do you know what it is, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
It's a collection of space-case do-gooders saving rain forests.
I have nothing to do with those bozos any more.
I've quit being the rich-kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffective fanatics!
So much for your grand plot, asshole!
My father has warned people about the dangers... of experimenting with DNA viruses for years.
You processed that information through your addled, paranoid infrastructure.
Lo and behold, a non-profit organization... becomes a sinister, revolutionary cabal!
This man is complete bat shit!
Ladies and gentlemen... do you realize where he thinks he comes from?
Captain Dan Miller, the man
in charge of the rescue operation...
says he has consulted with experts...
and they assure us
there will be no negative--
If you ask me, the monkey's gonna eat that goddam sandwich himself.
Did a man just come running through here?
His primary responsibility
was to the missing boy.
Police say
that the body of a woman...
found strangled
in Knutson State Park...
could be kidnapping victim...
Dr Kathryn Railly.
Anybody see someone come through here?
The body was discovered
less than an hour ago by hikers.
But we have an unconfirmed report
that the victim...
a woman in her late 20s
or early 30s...
was savagely mutilated.
Earlier in the day, police located
Railly's abandoned car.
It was found not far from--
Any sign of him?
Nothing.
He can't just disappear.
You bastard!
I could have died in there, you son of a bitch!
What are you thinking of... you twisted sack of shit?
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.
I'm sick of you.
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?
Yes.
- A million people, five billion people.
- What?
Jeffrey Goines said that it was my idea about the virus.
We were in the institution.
It was all so fuzzy with the drugs.
Do you think it was my idea?
Do you think maybe
I wiped out the human race?
Nobody is gonna wipe out the human race.
Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.
You've created something in your mind.
- Mentally divergent?
- Whatever.
A substitute reality... because you don't want to deal with anything.
I would love it if that was true.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.
I can help you.
- They're after me.
- Who is after you?
We have to get out of here.
There were policemen at that party.
Party? You went to a--
Never mind.
It's important you surrender instead of them catching you running away.
Wouldn't it be great if I was crazy?
Then the world would be okay.
- Give me the gun. Where is the gun?
- I lost the gun.
I could live right here.
You got water, air, stars.
- I'm gonna attract their attention.
- Debris.
I'm gonna attract their attention so they know where we are.
I love this world!
They're gonna tell you to put your hands on your head. Do what they say.
I love the frogs, the spiders.
I'll be with you.
I'll help you. I won't let them--
Then I said something about cooperating, and he said he would do that.
So I got in the car.
Thanks. And when l--
I started honking the horn, and when I got out, he was gone.
I tell you something.
You lucked out.
For a while we thought you were a body found down state, mutilated.
- He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?
I want to be clear about this, okay?
This man and the other one were severely beating us.
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.
Funny thing, Doctor.
Maybe you can help explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist and all.
Why do kidnap victims always tell us about the guys that grabbed 'em... and they try to make us understand... how kind these bastards really were.
It's a normal reaction to a life-threatening situation.
He's sick, okay?
He thinks he comes from the future.
He lives in a meticulously constructed fantasy world that's disintegrating.
He needs help.
Exhausted but apparently unharmed
by her 30-hour ordeal...
Dr Railly returned to Baltimore
without making a public statement.
The author and psychiatrist
is currently in seclusion at her home.
Meantime, police have pieced together
a scenario of the series of events...
that began with escaped
mental patient James Cole--
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.
I'm just hyper-alert.
I can't sleep.
- Did you take a sedative?
- I hate those things. They mess me up.
With the kidnapping
of the Baltimore woman, James Cole...
is now also wanted in connection...
with the brutal slaying of Rodney
Wiggins, an ex-convict from Ardmore.
His body was discovered
in an abandoned theatre...
not far from where Cole left 3 animal
rights activists bound and gagged...
in their Second Avenue headquarters.
Now, do they really believe that he's going to show up here? Please.
In Fresno, California, the corn field
that was jammed with spectators--
He's dead, isn't he?
That little boy.
He's fine. It was just a prank he and his friends pulled.
The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky
Neuman from an abandoned mine shaft...
ended abruptly
when playmates confessed...
that Neuman's disappearance
was a prank.
In fact, the missing child
was hiding in a nearby barn.
I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you
Congratulations, Cole.
Well done. Well done.
During your interview, while you were under the influence... you told us you liked music.
- This isn't a prison,James.
- This is a hospital.
- Until you recover your equilibrium.
- You're still a little disoriented.
- Time travel is a very stressful thing.
- You stood up very well, considering.
You connected the Twelve Monkeys with a famous virologist and his son.
- Others will take over now.
- We'll be back in service in months.
We'll retake the planet.
This is what you've been working for.
- A full pardon.
- You'll be out of here in no time.
- Women will want to get to know you.
- I don't want your women!
I want to get well!
And you will be well,James.
Soon.
You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.
We can't travel back in time.
You're not here.
You can't trick me.
You're in my mind.
I am insane, and you are my insanity.
He not only used the word " prank" ... he said the boy was hiding in a barn.
Kathryn, Kathryn, he kidnapped you.
You saw him murder somebody... and you knew there was a real possibility... he could kill you too.
You're under tremendous emotional stress.
For God's sake, Owen, listen to me.
He knew about the boy in Fresno... and he says five billion people are gonna die.
No way he could possibly know that.
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.
You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
What we say is the truth is what everybody accepts, right?
Psychiatry is the latest religion.
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.
I'm in trouble here.
I'm losing my faith.
You sure fucked up, Bob.
But I can understand.
You don't want your mistakes
pointed out to you.
I can relate to that, old Bob.
I know what you're thinkin'.
You're thinkin'I don't exist
except in your head.
I can see that point of view.
But you could still talk to me,
couldn't ya?
I saw you... in 1996, in the real world.
- You pulled out your teeth.
- Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?
That's a no-no.
And when did you say you saw me?
- In 1872?
- Leave me alone!
Yellin' won't get you
what you want.
You have to be smart
to get what you want.
- What do I want?
- You don't know what you want?
Sure you do, Bob.
You know what you want.
You tell me.
Tell me what I want.
To see the sky and the ocean...
to be topside...
breathe the air...
to be with her.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you want?
Bob?
Jim Halperin, Philly PD.
Sorry to call you so early.
You found him? Is he okay?
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.
No sign of your good friend, the kidnapper.
However, the plot does thicken.
I got a ballistics report here on my desk.
It says the bullet you claim you removed from Cole's thigh... is, in fact, an antique.
And all indications are...
it was fired sometime
prior to the 1920s.
- How about I take a spin down there?
- This can't be.
You and I can grab a bite to eat... and maybe you could revise or amplify your statement.
You can't trick us, you know.
It wouldn't work.
No, sir.
You haven't become addicted,
have you...
to that dying world?
No, sir.
I just want to do my part to get us back on top... in charge of the planet.
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.
He really is the most qualified.
But all that behaviour.
You said we weren't real.
I don't think the human mind is meant to exist... in two different... whatever you called it, dimensions?
It's just too stressful.
You said that yourself.
It's very confusing. You don't know what's real and what's not.
But you know what's real now.
Yes, sir, I do.
No, I don't know anything about... a monkey army, Doctor.
No, nothing whatsoever.
Good Lord, if my son was ever involved in something like that--
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.
I think it's doubly inappropriate to discuss... security matters with you,
Dr Railly.
But if it will ease your mind... rest assured that neither my son... nor any other unauthorized person... has access to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory.
Is that clear to you now?
Thank you so much for your concern.
Women psychiatrists!
I attended a lecture of hers once.
" Apocalyptic Visions."
She was suddenly struck... by the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.
Has she succumbed to her own...
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?
Maybe we ought to review our security procedures.
Perhaps upgrade 'em, you know?
Beef'em up.
Let's consider again our current information.
If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia... on December 27, 1996, that makes us know that--
It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1996.
And was seen sequentially after that in--
San Francisco, New Orleans...
Rio de Janeiro...
Rome, Kinshasa...
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
That was very well done.
If you're in there,
I have to talk to you!
It's the kidnap woman. The one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the light!
- What's she doin'?
- She's drawing attention to us.
I don't know what you're up to, but you're gonna get us in deep shit.
Walkies ready, batteries charged?
I saw you!
I saw somebody in there!
Secret experiments.
That's what they do.
Secret, weird stuff.
- Not just on animals.
- I know you.
- Do 'em on people too down at--
- Have you seen James Cole?
They're watching you.
- Takin' pictures.
- The police.
I know. Look.
I have to contact James.
It's very, very important that he's really careful when he reaches me.
Do you understand that?
- Good.
- Who's James?
He was with me.
He spoke to you several weeks ago.
He said that you were from the future and that you were watching him.
Bolt cutters.
Did you get the bolt cutters?
One dozen. They're in the van.
- The plans for the security system?
- All right here, committed to memory.
- You know what she's doin' out there?
- What's it say?
I can't see it.
Forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand.
Your psychiatrist?
- Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.
This woman was your psychiatrist... and now she's spray-painting our building?
What's it say?
- What?
- There's a policeman over there.
- Pretend you don't know me.
- I want to turn myself in.
- Where is he?
-James! Down!
No, it's okay.
I'm not crazy any more.
I mean, I am. I'm mentally divergent.
I know that now.
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.
Let's get outta here.
He's going. Go!
- I've seen that before.
- No, you haven't.
A guy in a Ford is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
No problem. It's probably just another kidnapping... featuring Jeffrey's shrink.
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.
This is your leader?
A certifiable lunatic... who told his former psychiatrist all his plans... for God knows what wacko irresponsible schemes?
God knows what she's written on that wall!
Who cares what psychiatrists write on walls?
You think I told her about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
Impossible! Do you know why?
Do you know why?
Because, you pathetically ineffectual... and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals, I'll tell you why.
Because when I had anything to do with her six years ago... there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought of it yet.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
Well, here's my theory on that.
When I was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively... in the guise of mental health.
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.
Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer... where they created this model of my mind.
Yes! Using that model... they managed to generate every thought...
I could possibly have in the next ten years... which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind... to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.
So, you see... she knew I was gonna lead the Army of the Twelve Monkeys... into the pages of history before it even occurred to me.
She knows everything I'm ever gonna do before I know it myself.
How's that?
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.
And if you forget one thing, I'll have you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.
-Jeff?
- What?
You're a great man.
Fuck the bozos!
He's seriously crazy.
You know that.
There. Over there.
Okay. Come on.
- I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours?
Go someplace else.
Here's... twenty-five, six, seven for an hour.
Deal?
One hour, honey babe.
Number 64.
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end of the hall.
Elevator's busted.
She's not "honey babe."
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.
Understand?
Whatever gets it up for you,Jack.
Tommy, this is Charlie over at the Globe.
You know if Wallace has a new girl?
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?
Okay, you were standing there looking up at the moon.
You were splashing through the water, and then what?
I thought I was in prison again.
Just like that, you were in prison?
No, not really.
Like you said, it was all in my mind.
You disappeared.
One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone.
Did you run through the woods, or--
I don't know.
I don't remember.
The boy in the well.
How did you know that was just a hoax?
It was?
I didn't know.
You said he was hiding in a barn!
I think I maybe saw a TV show about that... when I was a kid where a boy--
It wasn't a TV show!
It was real!
Maybe this boy saw the same TV show that I did... and he copied it.
Look, you were right.
I am mentally ill.
I imagined all these things, these people.
I know they're not real.
I can trick them.
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.
I got back here to get better.
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?
I think I had a dream about this.
You had a bullet from World War I in your leg. How did it get there?
I don't know. You said I had delusions, that I created this world.
- You said you could explain.
- I can't!
I'm trying to, and--
I can't believe that everything we say or do has already happened.
We can't change what's gonna happen.
And if five billion people are gonna die, it's--
I want the future to be unknown.
I want to become a whole person again.
I want this to be the present.
I want to stay here this time... with you.
Do you remember six years ago you had a phone number?
- It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.
It was the wrong number in 1990.
It should be the right number now.
Do you remember it?
The number.
This is my territory, bitch!
- Is this real or one of my delusions?
- This is definitely real.
Excuse me. I think we've got a little misunderstanding here.
- Yeah. We--
- Gee, really?
Now, you just sit tight, chief.
You listen to me, little Miss Understanding.
You think you can go around me and peddle your ass in this part of town?
You bet your life we got what I would call... a major fuckin' misunderstanding.
James, no! Don't!
Put him in the closet.
Take his money first!
- You want me to rob him?
- We need cash!
Call the cops!
Call the cops!
What's goin' on?
I've got friends, man.
Don't fuckin' kill me.
No,James!
Open the door!
What the fuck are you doing?
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.
James, come on.
Just in case--
Just in case I'm not crazy, this is how they find us.
By our teeth.
I don't want them to find me ever.
I don't want to go back.
Step back.
You'd better load.
Police! Throw your weapons out and come on out!
Hey! Is that the cops?
I'm the innocent victim here.
I was attacked by a coked-up whore... and a fuckin' crazy dentist.
Try to blend in.
Oh,Jesus!
Come on.
There's gotta be a phone around here somewhere.
Over there. Look.
I'm gonna try that number, okay?
Let's hope it's nothing.
It's okay! We're insane.
We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.
- A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.
No scientists.
No men from the future.
It's just a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.
You leave a message telling where you want your carpet cleaned.
- You left them a message?
- Yeah, I couldn't resist.
Wait till they hear this nutty woman telling them to watch out... for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
I said, "The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue--"
"Is the secret headquarters of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones who are gonna do it.
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.
Have a merry Christmas.''
You couldn't have heard me.
They got your message.
They played it for me.
It was a bad recording, distorted.
I didn't recognize your voice.
This.
And this.
And this.
Is everything okay?
You want anything?
Shall I put this on your account, ma'am?
No. That'll be cash.
Can you tell me what floor the wigs are on?
You turned the thing into a fucking computer.
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.
He's like, "If you guys get nailed, which I'm pretty sure you will...
I've never seen you before in my fuckin' life.''
Come on, come on.
Bring him through.
Drive!
What's the harm in openin' up the bag?
His eyes are taped, right?
Right?
Hello. Hello.
Wanna hear the monkey speak?
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.
- I recognize your voice.
- No, you don't.
I also know all about your warped little plan.
That lady, your psychiatrist?
She told me.
I didn't believe her.
It just seemed too crazy, even for you.
But just in case, I took steps... to make sure that you couldn't go through with it.
I don't have the code any more.
I don't have access to the virus.
I took myself out of the loop.
Too late! Too late!
We've got plans for you, Dad.
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it's true.
Jeffrey?
You're completely insane.
No, I'm not.
There's a cross section of one of
the old trees that's been cut down.
Here I was born.
And there I died.
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.
I think I've seen this movie before.
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.
- I did see it before.
- Tall trees.
Have you been here before?
- Yes.
- When?
- But I don't recognize this--
- When were you born?
- Long ago.
- Where?
What's the matter?
Tell me.
Madeleine, tell me.
It's just like what's happening with us.
Like the past.
The movie never changes.
It can't change.
But every time you see it, it seems different because you're different.
You see different things.
Please don't ask me.
If you can't change anything because it's already happened... you may as well smell the flowers.
What flowers?
It's an expression.
Why are you doing this?
I want to know why.
What if I'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?
What if I am crazy?
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.
If there's still... football games, traffic jams...
TV shows and armed robberies... we're going to be so glad... that we'll be thrilled to see the police.
I'm responsible for you now.
The Chinese say
once you've saved a person's life...
you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.
Do you have a plan?
I have to know.
There's so little that I know.
You said you'd never seen the ocean.
Hurry up. Come on.
Jeffrey?
You know I can't see.
Where are we?
Jeffrey? Please.
We have 9:30 reservations for Key West.
I just didn't recognize you.
Well, you look pretty different yourself.
It was always you.
In my dream.
It was always you.
I remember you like this.
You do?
I felt I've known you before.
I feel like I've always known you.
I'm so scared.
What time's your flight, friends?
- Might be tight.
Tight? No.
My watch says 7:30.
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty of time.
But today you gotta take into account your Army of the Twelve Monkeys factor.
What? What'd you say?
Twelve Monkeys.
In case you folks didn't turn on your radio this mornin'.
Bunch of weirdos let all the animals out of the zoo.
Then they locked up this big-shot scientist in one of the cages.
Scientist's own kid one of the ones did it.
They've got animals all over the place.
Bunch of zebras closed down the thruway about an hour ago.
And they got some thing called an emu.
It's got traffic blocked for miles on 676.
What do they think they're accomplishing
by releasing an animal like this...
into a city like this one?
That's what they were up to-- freeing animals.
On the walls. It said, "We did it."
They meant the animals.
I think it's gonna be all right.
Tell your people if they spot either one of them not to try and apprehend them.
They should notify us.
We have people all over the airport.
We'll take care of it.
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.
This is my dream.
- Your moustache.
- It's not just my dream.
I was actually here.
I remember now.
About a week or two before everyone started dying.
Careful.
They might be looking for us.
- I was here as a kid.
- Use this.
I think you were here then too.
If they identify us, they're going to send us someplace... but it won't be Key West.
I'll go fix this.
I'm gonna get the tickets.
I'll meet you in the newspaper stand.
Judy Simmons.
I have reservations for Key West.
- I don't see a lot of this. It's cash.
- It's a long story.
We'll begin boarding in about 20 minutes.
- You have a nice flight, Miss Simmons.
- Thank you.
Hello. How are you today?
I don't know whether you're there or not.
Maybe you just clean carpets.
If you do, you're lucky.
You're gonna live a long, happy life.
But if you other guys are out there, if you're picking this up... forget about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys is just a bunch of dumb kids... playing revolutionaries.
Listen, I've done my job.
I did what you wanted.
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.
San Francisco, New Orleans...
Rio de Janeiro, Rome...
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.
This is some trip you're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?
Business.
Have a good one, sir.
Got yourself a prob, Bob?
Leave me alone!
I made a report.
I didn't have to do that.
Point of fact:
You don't belong here.
It's not permitted to let you stay.
This is the present.
This is not the past.
This is not the future.
This is right now!
I'm not leaving! Get that?
You can't stop me.
Anything you say, chief.
It's none of my business.
- Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone!
Calm down, Cole. It's me.
Cole, it's me.
-Jose?
- Yeah, right,Jose.
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.
- Here, take this.
- What for? Are you crazy?
Me? Are you kidding?
You're the one.
You're a hero, man.
They pardoned you, and you come back and fuck with your teeth.
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.
They did their reconstruction thing on it.
The phone--
The phone call I just made?
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.
Thirty years ago.
They just put it together.
"Uh, hey, this is Cole,James.
I don't know whether you're there or not. Maybe you just clean carpets.''
Where'd you get that from?
"Forget about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys."
Man, if only they could've got your message earlier.
Take it. You could still be a hero if you cooperate!
Come on,James.
It's okay.
- $6.50's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is ready for boarding at gate 38.
Oh, my God!
I got orders to shoot the lady if you don't go along this time.
- What?
- Yeah, you got that?
- They said, "If Cole don't obey--"
- I'll break your fuckin' head!
You hear me?
Volunteers now boarding
at gate 37.
You see?
I had no choice.
These are my orders, man.
Just take it.
Take it!
This part isn't about the virus at all, is it?
It's about following orders, about doing what you're told.
Hey, man, you got a pardon.
What do you want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
James! It's Dr Goines' assistant.
He's an apocalypse nut.
I think he's involved.
The next flight to San Francisco leaves from gate 38.
If he's there,
I'm sure he's part of it.
Mr Holtz, you wanna have a look at this, please?
Sir, would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag?
We don't have time for this.
Excuse me.
Biological samples.
I have the papers right here.
I'm gonna have to ask you to open this up, sir.
Open it?
Why, yes, of course.
What could be better?
Look at the planes. Hurry up.
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am, you have to get in the line.
You see?
Biological.
Check the papers.
It's all proper.
I have a permit.
- It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.
It looks empty, but I assure you, it's not.
- You don't understand.
- I don't have to.
This is very important.
There's a man carrying a deadly virus.
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.
It doesn't even have an odour.
That's not necessary, sir.
There you go.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.
- Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron!
- A fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her!
Hold it!
Wait a moment.
There he is! That man!
He's carrying a deadly virus!
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!
Police officer.
He's got a gun!
Watch it!
Freeze!
Excuse me.
It's obscene.
All the violence, all the lunacy.
Shootings even at airports now.
You might say that we're the next endangered species.
Human beings.
I think you're right, ma'am.
I think you've hit the nail on the head.
Jones is my name.
I'm in insurance.
Rachel, hi, it's... it's Simon.
Um, I don't know how long you've got this flat for,
I hope it's nice, I hope it's okay.
I know you don't want to, but we've really got to talk about our house or, you know, fix the price.
I've tried calling you at work.
Please ring back.
You'll be with us two afternoons a week, uh?
Bag. Far to drive?
No.
Only the London hospital.
I teach there.
You'll have your work cut out. Harold does his best, but his not a nurse.
- Harold?
- Your assistant.
Every movement, a key.
Don't worry. They're all being banged up.
Feeding time.
- High heels.
- No, I don't say.
Beauty parlour now have we?
Go on, doll, give the screws some.
I'm on my dinner break really.
So I'm getting off.
But when you've finished, just say
Harold, and I'll see you out.
Make sure you're all right.
Have a nice break.
I think we might as well start here.
Oral surgery.
Yes, well, shall we sure move on.
This is the waiting area. We like to bring them over in blocks, Wing by wing.
Keep your eye on the numbers.
Officers get twitchy, if there's too many cons are hanging about.
X-Ray.
Records.
For medications we put a prescription in the files and an M.O. passes it out later, on the wing.
Loo.
They will keep promicing us a nurse, but we like to say nothing, say it well, and keep on saying it.
Doctor Hockley, Rachel Clifford.
New dentist two days a week.
For her sins?
Fall into step up.
Four coming, two for visits.
You'll have to send over.
Hey, you can't put "Elvis" down as a religion.
Elvis isn't a religion.
Yeah, well, it is to me.
Why not? It's as good as any.
- I'm not accepting Elvis.
- Put "C. of E." "Church of Elvis."
Oh... Yeah, this is Graceland, isn't it?
I think I'm in love with you, you know, bastard.
You should be fine now, all right?
Harold, why can't I issue dental floss?
Because they'd floss each other's heads off, that's why.
I haven't any records for Chaney.
He's been transferred from up North.
It's all right. I'll just get your details, have that out of the way.
Dr Hockley might have his medicals.
Any medical history?
Allergic to penicillin?
Anything I need to be warned about?
No?
No major renovations?
So, what's the problem?
- Pain, really.
- Upper or lower?
Both.
Front?
And back.
And a funny clicking.
And open.
Close.
Open.
You can close again.
Tempero-mandibular joint dysfunction.
I was just saying that to the boys.
London has a problem with cockroaches.
Doesn't it just...
You are grinding very heavily.
And it's wearing down your teeth.
Can you lean back? It could cause vertical fractures which can be quite serious.
Is that comfy?
This'll be fun.
I haven't seen one of these in years.
The clicking... um is in your joint.
It's the disk. It's becoming displaced.
At the very worst it'll start locking, and... then you're in real trouble.
- Lockjaw?
- Good as. Open.
And bite down. Lovely.
It's stress, causing you to grind. Tension.
Everyone does it to some extent.
London cabdrivers are the worst. It's unreal.
They come in right down to their gums.
Go like that.
Lovely.
Just ask you to hold still for just a sec.
- Rachel.
- Sorry, I'm disturbing you.
No, no, not at all.
I need my old kits,
I can't take any more from the hospital.
Right. Of course.
I didn't think you'd be here.
No, no. Please.
So, how's this prison?
Fine.
I saw a textbook once, someone trying to show facial characteristics, that could indicate criminality.
You know, jaw-size and that sort of thing.
Same guy tried an identification system based on ears.
Like fingerprints.
- Rachel.
- I know all about the house.
I don't just want to talk about that.
Take the cabinet.
I can't afford to go any lower.
I haven't only been ringing about the house.
Sorry?
I'm trying to say that...
I know, you've been through a lot.
I needed to sort some things out, too.
There have been days,
I couldn't even come down here.
I remember that.
- You were fucking her then.
- Christ.
Don't come crying to me, Simon.
Tell your little tart in the sari.
I'm not listening to this.
I'm trying to talk to you.
Who was this smile for?
Who were you smiling for?
It was like...
It was like living in a bubble here.
Like a desert island, you know?
You, me, the house, the practice, everything.
Well, I'm really sorry!
"There have been days,
I couldn't even come down here"
What does he expect me to do?
How am I supposed to feel?
Rachel, you have to meet Pearl.
She's just...
Well, I can't describe it.
You know, people talk about healing hands.
But she's got healing eyes.
I was telling her about Oliver, and all the trouble that he causes...
How Katie gets so upset with him coming and going.
And that I want Katie to have a father, or no father, but not this pulling.
And Pearl's eyes just telling me "Let go".
Because you have to, you know, you can't get ten out of ten all the time.
Right then. That's fine.
Um... Just make sure that you check the inclusions right, because the bite is very close.
Okay, I'll do that.
- Haven't you finished yet?
- Almost.
- If any one is on, get me at the jail.
- Have fun!
That dentist on today?
What, the toothfairy?
Yeah. She's doing "B" wing.
I'd give her one.
I'm lying in the chair, and she's giving me this, leaning, rubbing up there.
She's got it all right.
She'd do it.
She loves it.
Coming in here.
You dirty, fucking bitch.
Yeah, coming in here...
You could take somebody's eye out with that.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
They let you out then?
You all right.
Don't worry.
I haven't done a runner.
I'd be wearing arrows.
That's how you can tell.
- I'm just surprised.
- Yeah, I didn't think it was you, either.
They do let us out on our own, you know?
We have our shoe shined.
Coming from the nick?
Just on my way back.
I've been to college.
I go one day a week.
- Starting today.
- Gosh, your first day!
You look like a store detective.
Making you nervious.
I do a degree course Computer programming.
I've been doing it for about four years.
At the correspondence, and a bit of open university.
And now I'm towards the end.
They've agreed to let me out.
Pound and twelve, please.
It says seventy. Seventy pence.
- It's... it's a code...
- Stock number. A pound twelve, please.
- Right, okay. That's okay.
- I'll get it.
No, leave it.
Take it with mine.
- No.
- Philip. It's twenty pence.
Give me the ninety.
Okay.
- I'll pay you back.
- That's okay.
No, I'll pay you back!
When you said "code", I thought "codes?".
You know, like not knowing the password when you're a kid, not knowing what team to support.
To think I used to run my own business.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
I've been waiting eight years for this.
How do you get back?
I get the tube to here, and here's the bus back to the nick.
See? All the cons coming out of the shade.
Well, it's nice to see you again.
- I'll get back for that.
- Sorry?
Oh, no. My pleasure.
"Oh, no. My pleasure."
I've been in dozens of times.
You have seen me.
I have a clinic, and I'm already late
Just a sec.
Delta-Juliet-Whiskey.
Reception.
Delta-Juliet-Whiskey.
Central. Over.
I've got a female here.
Says she's a new vet.
- Dentist?
- Dentist, yeah. You know her.
- Good-looking?
- Is that Sexton?
- Dark, yeah.
- She'll need an excort.
Okay. Come over and pick her up.
You silly tart.
Come on.
Blimey. Not like she's a Mick.
You're not, are you?
Don't worry about her, we call all the medics vets.
And all the men animals.
Only those that are, mam.
All right, Lanny.
That's you done.
Lanny. Elvis.
Come on, Leonard.
We've other patients to see.
Look, I know what you're thinking, right?
You're thinking I'm not Elvis Presley.
Well, I know that. I know who I am. I do.
- You're a lucky man.
- Yeah. I'm the King.
Come on. Out.
It's a guard just like boxers wear, and it exactly fits your mouth
So, even if you are still grinding at night, it won't damage your teeth.
All right.
That's it.
But, I'm afraid...
You may need endless adjustments.
Takes forever to get it right.
I haven't had a visit in five years.
Cheeky bugger.
I mean, he could be anything.
A child molester or a rapist.
- No, I don't think so.
- You can't tell, can you?
Well, I can tell he's lonely.
Come on, five years without a visit, so would you be.
Those are all for the prison.
I hate it when patients do that.
He used to run his own business, so he said.
Thieving probably.
Or drugs.
Anyway. I'm sure you're not allowed to visit.
Not in a prison attached to.
Quite.
Bet he knows, too.
Just trying it on.
Can't blame them, really, I suppose.
Mum, it's not dangerous.
There are prison officers everywhere.
Not in the room, not with you.
- No, but...
- It's so different. I wish you'd told us.
There's been such a lot happening, what with moving and everything.
Have you seen Simon?
No, I haven't seen him.
I just thought...
You still haven't sold the house...
Mum, this is London.
The property market's collapsed, that's why we haven't sold it.
Him in that beautyful house...
And you were always such a clever girl.
Come on, duck. Come to see your dad.
That's brandy and coke.
- What's this then?
- That's Bacardi.
All right.
What's this?
That's the baby's bloody bottle.
Can't win, can you?
Try to look nice and a man treats you like you're on the game.
Who are you dressing for?
Where are you going after?
Don't bother and you're showing him up front of his mates.
- Come on, love, move yourself.
- Come on, mate.
Come on. Can we move through now, please?
Here we go.
Oh. Sealed visits.
IRA?
Funny sort of IRA men.
- Hardly recognised you.
- I don't look that different, do I?
You look great.
Sit down.
- All right?
- I'm sure staff aren't allowed to visit.
- It's all right. They won't clock you.
- They're not blind.
Yeah, they are.
They don't see people, just bodies.
They count them in and count them out.
- You could train monkeys to do that.
- Why are you shaking then?
You'd do well in here.
That's what we spend half our lives doing.
Reading each other.
Oh, yeah.
So, what you wanna do?
Eat first, then the pictures, or pictures first?
No, nothing to see, is there?
No, you're probably right.
I'm fed up with going out anyway.
I don't know how you do it.
Coming back in the evenings.
- It's the weekends that are a real killer.
- Empty?
Yeah, how about you?
- Me?
- Facing into this lot?
Psychopaths and gangsters, and that's just the screws.
I used to share a practice in Clapham.
Oh, yeah?
I did jobs all over Clapham.
No, not, you know, no.
No, proper job.
Wiring and rewiring houses, contracting.
Stockwell, Brixton. Brixton, lived there.
Lived all over.
Better than being stuck in a room all day.
You can say that again.
Sorry.
What?
No, what is it? Tell me.
When you were at the supermarket, you weren't tagged.
So I knew it was play for the jail.
No wedding ring.
Oh, no.
I some...
We split up.
Same here.
- Have you told her that?
- Well, as it happens, she told me.
That's what made it easier.
Easier asking you.
Is that what this is?
Practice?
I don't know.
You're the one with all the cards. You can find out anything about me. You're staff.
No.
But I'd prefer if you ask me.
Of course.
No, absolutely...
Look, you said you hadn't had a visit and I just thought...
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate this.
A bomb exploded this morning in a shopping centre in Finchley North London...
No warning was given about the device.
The explosion occured to start...
Out of order, that is.
... crowded shopcenter...
They call themselves soldiers. ... they found a second bomb which was made safe...
Chief Inspector Keith Toplow,
Head of the...
Oi! Don't feed the animals, right?
Snow? Guys?
All right, Elvis.
Fancy a little jailhouse rock, do we?
Do you want to try a little piece of the Devil's Dandruff?
You, damn pussycat.
Hey, man. Don't let the crown. Dig it down.
Simon.
Bloody house.
- Hello?
- Is that Rachel?
Philip... where are you?
How can you ring?
Phonecards. All the wings have them.
We can call out anytime.
Well, I didn't give you this number.
I'm sorry... to disturb you.
I'm sorry if it's a liberty.
- Who did you say you were?
- Personal, I just said it was personal.
Right, well, I'll hurry up then,
I was just wondering if... if you're doing anything next week, if you're up for a visit?
Next week's difficult.
Week after?
I can't make it.
Look, as you said, I'm stuff.
Only part-time, but...
No, I understand.
- No, really...
- No, I understand. That's cool.
Fuck off.
You don't want to jeopardize anything.
It's like college.
I don't want to jeopardize anything.
Well, that's right. Exactly.
Listen, these phonecards don't...
Oh, shit.
- What are you up to?
- That vet, what's she up to, uh?
That's the question.
Calls herself a dentist.
You see the nigger last night?
He's having a laugh, isn't he?
"Look at me, I'm a gangster".
I've been to see her, right?
I got gold crowns.
Five. Now I've got only four.
Five gold crowns cost me a lot of money.
"Devil's Dandruff"...
I mean, who the fuck does he think he is, uh?
Now. One, two, three, four.
Right?
Brixton. Parkhurst.
Durham. Wakefield. Scrubs.
Where's the Scrubs?
Where's the Scrubs?
- She's got it.
- She hasn't.
Yeah. Her and that doctor bloke, Hockley.
I'm worth more to them dead than I'm alive.
You can laugh.
I know, what they're doing.
What's they're doing done exactly the same to Elvis.
I know, what they're doing.
Exactly the same...
Hi.
All right?
I hoped I'd find you somewhere around here.
Lurking about.
You were cut off.
Seems so, yeah...
Listen...
I'm sorry I was so abrupt.
I was really taken back by the phone.
I didn't realize you could call out.
Yeah, you can call anyone.
Dial a pizza, live in hope...
No ring today.
No.
I hate wearing it.
He had an affair.
My husband.
She was very beautiful, apparently.
- How could he be so bloody stupid?
- Well...
No more shopping trips?
I got mugged though.
You'll be seeing to his teeth.
- In the jail?
- Oh yeah.
Where I did most of my time, up North, that was much quieter.
It had to be, so many dangerous people walking about.
Down here, it's all... junkies, and crackheads, and kids making a name for themselves.
- Why not stay up North?
- That's long sentences.
When you come to the end, when you're going out, they put you in short term, like this one.
But any trouble, they can knock you back a year, two years.
Any little thing.
- Asking me?
- Maybe.
I could report you.
Well, you've had plenty of time.
I've still got your note.
Evidence.
Yeah, but you won't use it, will you?
I could lose my job.
Can't have that, can we?
- Someone could see us.
- Just a chance meeting.
Well, that depends...
On what?
A pillow case is a pillow case, mate.
It ain't a suit of armour.
Sorry mate. We heard you had rocks, heard you were bringing in parcels.
I don't do drugs.
- You know where to go for that, don't you?
- Towler?
I owe him a grand already.
Oi, cosyhead! You shut up, man.
You give me a fucking headache.
Hi man. Where's my script?
I said, where's my damn script?
All right, Towler. Shut it.
Bite.
Now down.
Open.
Bite.
Toerag...
Coming along nicely.
Yeah...
Mister... Mister Towler.
Must fancy them, do you?
Hanging round here.
Wouldn't mind the treatment they get?
- Make an appointment.
- Oh yeah...
- Pleasure parlour have we?
- No, place of chaos.
Uuuh... Whips and canes.
Plenty of customers in this place.
How come some files have prisoner's offences and others don't?
- A mess, isn't it?
- Different jails.
Not wondering about Lenny, are you?
You don't want to know about him.
You should see the book he's reading.
Adventures stories for girls...
Ouone-six, Mister Sexton, can you come to control? Over.
Yeah, I'll be along.
I'll see you later.
Let's go outside.
It's cold.
- We've got time.
- We'll freeze.
That's not the point though, is it?
Relax.
I'm risking my liberty here.
I know you are.
Oh, thank you, Angela.
I have to go.
- Okay?
- Beautiful.
Hare Krishna.
- Hang on. Let's take a closer look.
- All right.
Bend over.
Okay, get dressed.
That comes under very special treatment
Are you surprised?
Happens all the time.
Oh, yeah?
Ever heard of "Her Majesty's Pleasure"?
That's why she has all those prisons.
I can still taste you on my fingers.
I can't believe I said that.
- I've got to go.
- Will you phone me?
Yeah.
Tell me, what does he do?
Computers.
He's into computers.
- Money, yes!
- No.
- Go on then.
- He's about the same age as me.
- Single?
- Very.
Not gay?
Definitely not.
He's in jail.
Jail?
Prison?
- He'll be out soon.
- But he's not...
He gets out to college one day a week.
But he's not like...
Katie!
- Sue, promise you won't tell anyone.
- Of course not.
- It's important. I'm not really meant him.
- Oh, well, no.
What's he done?
I don't know.
It's not something you can just jump right into.
It's very... personal.
I don't know. Maybe he's probably a bank robber or something.
But you've got to find out.
- I know.
- Katie!
Well, where's your glove?
Where's your other glove?
Well, you go back and look for it.
I mean, normally, right, you meet a guy and you think he's a bit tasty.
You've got three questions:
Is he a psycho?
Well, he's in jail, so that tells us something.
Has he got any money, or you might gonna have to support him all the rest of his lazy life?
And what he is like between the sheets, and you don't know.
You have it...
It's so weird.
I know.
Sometimes I'm afraid it's me using him.
I can see it in his eyes.
How much he longs for me.
I have so much power.
What do you really know about him?
I know he doesn't wear dentures.
I chose that.
Well, I don't know why exactly.
I really like it.
I really like it...
There's no hidden message, of course.
This morning, you know, just before you're awake that moment between waking and sleeping
I felt you beside me.
I could feel your hand stroking my thigh.
It felt beautiful.
And then I woke up.
Hang on a sec. Phone.
Sorry about that. Just Mike from work.
We're having a drink tomorrow.
Anyway, love, think of me in there with you.
Just Mike from work.
We're having a drink tomorrow.
Mike from work.
Every time I see you, I want you.
Even in the surgery if you brush against me
I want you inside me.
Sometimes I can hardly stand it.
What are we doing?
That's what you wanted.
That's why I gave you the note.
Say that again.
What you just said?
That's why you're here.
That's why you're working in the jail.
- I don't think that's very funny.
- Well, neither do I.
Christ!
You had a little get-together, did you?
The GBH Club. "Oh, she's putting it about."
"Must be all our broken noses." - Rachel.
I'm a professional woman fucking a prisoner in a toilet!
Keep it down to a scream.
Well, I don't know what you want.
I don't know what you're doing here with the con.
It's like you said.
What are you looking for?
You started this.
You asked me.
What do you want, a bit of rough?
Phil! How are you doing, mate?
Are you all right? How's it going?
All right.
Just go left. Go left again.
You can't miss it.
Hello... Rachel?
If you're there, will you come to the phone?
I'm sorry that happened.
Rachel?
I've been calling all night.
Are you there?
Listening?
I haven't been close to anyone.
I'm not used to it yet.
I wanna be with you,
I want us to be together.
I tried earlier, the machine was on.
So I wasn't sure, you'd be in.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
How's Mister Big?
You know, I've been thinking
What with everything about the police these days, we don't even know, if he's guilty.
He killed his wife.
Murdered her.
Did he tell you?
No. I found out.
He hit her during an argument.
Oh, Rachel.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'll have to stop seeing him.
Obviously.
I can't...
Well, I've taken enough chances.
He must have loved her very much.
- Loved her?
- Well...
I don't know.
He found out she was seeing someone else.
Then he should have let her go.
- Maybe he couldn't?
- Forgive her then.
Would you forgive him?
Rachel...
- If you love someone?
- You hardly know this guy.
How can you love him?
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I'll be fine.
What do you think you're doing?
What are you doing in here?
This is my house!
Get out, get out of my house!
And you might be fucking my husband, but you don't touch my things!
These are my things! You don't touch my things!
Now get out of my house!
- We're selling the house!
- You're not! It's not yours to fucking sell!
I'm the estate-agent, Missis Clifford.
Oh, my God.
We've got a client coming to view the property.
I did telephone and leave a message.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
They melt them down, don't they?
That's what they're doing, the pair of them.
Her and that bloke Hockley him.
Called me a psychopath.
Fancy that.
- Bang out of order.
- All right, all right.
What are you fucking looking at?
Are you in love with me? You slag.
Liberty, isn't it?
Extracting a molar.
She's helping you escape. Taking you out bit by bit, then woosh. You're gone.
Oi! You!
I've seen Marathon Man.
I know what happens.
Call yourself a dentist.
Fuck you and the horse you came in on.
...should be defrocked.
I want my teeth back!
Hockley!!!
You call me a psychopath again and I'll fucking kill you!
Leave him!
- Get back in your room! - But he...
- I said into your surgery!
Brandy.
- Up the big house?
- Yeah.
Park over here if you like.
Thanks.
That's one eighty, please.
Hear what happened?
Apparently another bloke topped his self.
What do they expect?
Doubling, trebling people up?
Can't even wank in peace.
Still... another day up the judge's arse.
- All right?
- Out.
All right, Phil?
This is Gus, a mate of mine.
Gus, Phil.
You've been doubled up, mate.
Sorry, mate.
Oh, he's all right. Looks like a hippo, but he's cool.
Cheers.
We'll help ourselves.
Playing house.
How did you meet this bloke, anyway?
I heard he hadn't had any visits.
Hadn't had one in years.
- He killed his wife.
- They don't bang them up for nothing, love.
Not for double parking.
She'd been cheating on him, so he said.
- He told you?
- No, it's what they said in court.
He doesn't know I known yet.
You must have known he'd done one.
Even if you didn't want to admit it.
Make your mind up time.
You got to hear his side of the story.
When I was little, my dad had come home and I'd run out to him.
And he'd scooped me up and hugged me.
He'd held me like his life depended on it.
He's like that.
He holds me like his life depends on it.
He feels like it does right now...
Why can't you put me through?
Hold on, will you?
- D-Hall. Mister Clark.
- I need to speak to Philip Chaney.
- It's an emergency.
- Who's speaking?
I'm a relative.
I've already been put through by reception.
Hold on.
Chaney!
Lady for you.
She says she's a relative.
She says it's an emergency.
Do you want me to take a number?
- Sorry, Miss.
- But it's important!
Not to him, sweetheart.
- I can't see you right now.
- Philip.
Strange things are happening at the nick.
Really strange.
I do wanna see you, but I've been doubled up.
It's the way it's happened.
It's too easy.
I went to the library.
Newspaper section.
Philip!
Philip!
You said you wouldn't go behind my back!
You said you'd ask me.
- I wanted to.
- You'd rather read the fucking hewspapers!
I'm a person here! I'm still a fucking person!
You said you'd split up!
That's what you told me!
You'd split up!
You're not the only one with feelings!
How do you think I felt?
Philip!
Talk to me!
All right, Phil?
How's your old lady?
Must be spending a fortune on phonecards.
- What's your game, Towler?
- What?
My old lady's dead.
Not your Avon Lady.
The one that comes calling.
She's well alive and kicking.
Fit bit a kit. Loves her jogging.
What do you want, Towler?
Just a message. A little parcel into the sick bay, day after tomorrow.
Things are getting a little difficult out there.
People them are sickening, man.
Leave it out.
She's a square peg.
She ain't searched when she comes in.
Piece of piss.
She's a fucking dentist.
That don't make her stupid.
I'll make an appointment.
Palm it off. Matter of seconds.
No.
All she has to do is waltz in, man.
With her handbag.
No.
She better do it.
Because if she don't,
I'm going to send her a nightmare.
I'll put a rapist in her house, you know.
There's been enough through here.
You know that.
Just one phone call.
Sorry.
Which is Microsoft Excel.
If you look to the left,
You have got the minus sign...
- Sorry, but how else I can talk to you?
- I was ringing you.
- I tried to get to the hospital.
- On the motorway. In some toilet.
There are things I need to know.
- Listen to me.
- Why did you give me the note?
- We've got five minutes.
- No, tell me.
- What did you want from me?
- Why do you think?
- The same reason you took it.
- I didn't kill anyone.
I can't take it any further, Philip.
I wanted to talk to someone.
Woman.
- You never spoke to anyone?
- You want a heart to heart in that place, you have it with the wall.
I'd given my statement to the police.
You can love the wrong person.
- Terrible things happen.
- You killed her.
I know.
I can't believe that was me.
I'm not saying I'm mental or anything.
In the morning when she got up, she got up the bed, she looked back at me and she smiled.
I thought: "She still loves me."
I could smell her scent in the room, while I was waiting for her.
She was two hours late.
And I knew, I knew there was someone new in her life.
Like I'd been once.
She broke my heart.
With no idea, no idea, what she was doing.
Like a child would...
I had my jacket on and was going out the door.
And she opened it.
If the phone had rang, if she'd stopped for milk on the way home...
Any one of a million tiny things...
I'd have been gone.
She smiled and I broke her head against the door jamb.
She went chalk white, you've no idea how fast.
I watched the life drain out of her.
I'd never hit her before.
You've got to get back.
There's something else.
- What?
- Towler's sussed us.
He wants you to bring a parcel in.
It's only drugs.
The place is flooded with them.
There's been a clamp-down.
You're just using me.
Rachel.
This has nothing to do with me.
This is a common thing.
I'll do the solitary, punishment.
He knows where you live.
- He knows more about you, than I do.
- I don't...
I can't handle this.
It's not me than I'm worried about.
- I don't want anything happening to you.
- Then get your hand away.
Don't lay that on me.
That's not what this is about.
I'd never hurt you.
Trust me.
I don't trust myself anymore.
The blast happened near the Centre Point building the headquarters of the
Confederation of Industry.
Eye-witnesses said they ducked for cover, they were calling for London
Ambulance Servicemen...
Shit.
Get away from me!
Two o'clock today at the Abbey.
Don't let him down. Not unless you want to see him in a wheelchair.
Nice kid.
Katie, isn't it?
Hey, Graham!
It's on the bar!
- Rachel.
- Hi.
Tools of the trade?
You're forgetting your torture kit.
Open.
- Another kit?
- No, I'll do that.
Mister Towler's next.
That's right.
Will you get me some new cards?
- No, I'm not seeing Towler today.
- What?
- Chaney.
- Hey, man...
- What's going on?
- It's a gun.
- Fucking gun?
- I'm not giving him a gun.
I'll go to the Governor.
They won't let me see you again.
I'm not losing you now.
Shouldn't be too much more.
I do a lot of bowling.
At the weekends.
Any night you've nothing better to do...
Yeow. Mister Sexton.
Nice one.
Chaney!
Get over here!
Stand over there and face me..
Hair.
Mouth.
Right.
Empty your pockets.
You got anything that you shouldn't have?
Get your arms out.
Right. Turn around. Put your right leg up. Down.
Left leg. Down. Away you go.
Go on then.
Go on.
See what happens to her.
You tell her next week...
She ain't never... going... through... that again!
She'd better...
Just a phone call.
Move yourselves!
I want to see the Governor.
Try Nelson Mandela.
I wanna talk to the Governor.
Brandi.
There was a woman in earlier.
Red hair, little girl?
Sorry. I've just come on.
- She's armed.
- She's not armed.
She's stuck with a gun.
He'll be after her.
Now you protect her.
Where's she likely to go?
Thought I'd find you here.
Creature of habit.
But you don't want to make a habit out of what you've done today. Now...
You be a good girl.
Give me the gun.
You've got nice hands, do you know that?
I've hidden it in the toilet.
Yeah?
Well, you come and show Daddy.
And I'll look after it for you.
Maybe you can have it back next week.
All right?
All right?
Come on.
Let go of my hand.
Whoever fired, put the gun down.
Put the gun down, please.
Kenny.
Kenny English.
Drop the firearm, Kenny
Kenny.
Is that your name then?
Kenny.
He could have taken you hostage.
Popped you one, popped one of our lads.
I reckon you've done us all a favour.
Reckon any jury'll think so and all.
Where are they taking him?
Whitemoor, Parkhurst...
Parkhurst probably on the Isle of Wight.
The Isle of Wight?
I'll have to cross water to see him.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Clem?
Turn down that thing, will ya?
You're gonna wake Scotty.
- What's that?
- The RCA.
- Scotty's got school tomorrow.
- All right.
Say, you haven't seen my glasses, have you?
On the table next to the clock.
Yes, you're such a pretty girl, aren't you?
- No, they're not here.
- Try the washroom.
What's gotten into Jack?
Anderson's bitch must be in heat again.
I'll go run her up the road.
What is it, Jack?
That old bitch doggin' you again?
Lulu, is that you out there?
You go on home, now, you hear?
Go on. Get.
What the devil?
Still dead?
I don't understand it.
County ran a new wire just last month.
You can drive him into town in the mornin'.
He looks like he could use a good night's rest anyway.
You get anything more out of him?
No. He just keeps saying he's lost.
Scotty, what are you doing down here?
You don't know this here boy, do you, son?
- Hush.
- I'll put him in the barn. Come on.
Come on.
You get out.
Why don't we go upstairs and run you a bath?
Didn't your mama think to give you a haircut?
Now, what is this?
My God.
Who'd do such a thing to a boy?
They're supposed to be asleep.
You always know they're supposed to be asleep.
Somebody else in this house beside that baby?
Somebody else in this house?
Boy, I am your father... and you answer your father.
Is there somebody else in this house?
Is this one as smart as the other one?
Afraid so.
How come they're all named Betty?
Well, now, that is a good Question.
Maybe they're not as smart as we think.
Here.
Stick with the jukebox.
My bird's fryin' her ass out there in the hot sun, Theodore.
Yeah, well, County Health's gonna fry my ass if I put her back inside.
- I serve food here, Arlis.
- So to speak.
And by the way, some 14-year-old kid... bought a pack of cigarettes out of your machine there... and his parents are threatening to sue me.
- You want me to take it out?
- Hell, no.
I'm just tellin' you what I'm up against.
Your mangy chicken's the least of my problems.
You should have heard the stink over the rubbers last week.
Do we have to have a prophylactic machine in the ladies' toilet?
We are doing 2-to-1 compared to the men's room.
I know, Arlis, but this ain't Abilene.
We're a small town.
We got small-town values.
- Am I right, Cindy?
- Amen.
Like I said, you just missed him.
We were preparing to close the casket.
Well, it's probably best.
I was sort of the black sheep of the family.
Well, as they say,
"In death, all is forgiven."
That's a nice sentiment.
I'll have to remember that.
Exactly what relation are you?
It's complicated.
Would you mind giving us a moment alone?
Of course.
The book is here if you care to sign.
Thank you.
God bless, whoever you are.
You know, my face breaks out about two days after you leave town.
Every time, like some goddamn teenaged girl.
- It's the chocolate.
- I know. I just can't help myself.
How come you don't have those cheese and peanut butter crackers anymore?
They pick up pinworms in the heat.
Pinworms? Jesus.
Too bad.
My kids love those things.
You want a carton of Kools for Nathan?
No. He's Quit. Again.
Jesus. I never get used to these chickens.
- About twenty-five.
- Twenty... Twenty-five late?
Lay it down.
You heard about Lou Jamison?
I heard his widow was lookin' to unload his machines.
Was. Pudge Riley got to her Friday last.
He get the Remingtons?
Two dozen electro-slots.
Says he's got a buyer for 'em in Oklahoma.
All I know is
Lou Jamison's widow is sittin'... on all the Texaco stations in Benson County... and most of the Dairy Queens, with no machines.
I don't want Benson County.
But Arlis, I had to drive through Benson to get here.
- Why not expand a little?
- I'm big enough.
- I don't need Benson.
- But Arlis...
Just make a note about the machines, Elliot.
Say, Arlis, I almost forgot.
There was a fella askin' about you over in Woodlake.
- Denny Harris?
- No. Just some fella.
Said he knew you from way back.
I figured he must've worked for you sometime.
- Why is that?
- He had one of our dimes.
You know, the blue juke dimes?
- You get a name?
- He didn't offer. I didn't ask.
Said he wanted to look you up.
Anyway, I stayed vague.
You did right.
I'll see you on the 7th.
Looks like I'm gonna be stretchin' felt in the mornin'.
You're gonna be stretchin' your luck if you're thinkin' about take-out... anytime soon.
It is a slight feverish tonight.
Just wait till that damn cake pops its lid.
Unless that little pastry inside comes with a bicycle pump... and two sisters, there ain't gonna be a farm animal safe tonight.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Three, two, one!
Christ Almighty.
Just put her in my pickup.
- Lookin' good.
- Here's to ya, honey!
Feel like knockin' a few sins off your ledger, Arlis?
You want me to find out if she's got a home.
And take her there.
What's the damage?
Well, put it this way.
Feed this girl a cucumber, it'd come out pickles.
Jesus.
I figure the bed's one of those vibratin' numbers... so that explains the Quarters.
Nobody could possibly fancy pretzel twists that much... so I figured you won some kind of weird contest.
As for the condoms, well, either you got a yen... for cheerleading squads, or we had the night of all nights.
Whatever.
There's an explanation.
As for the blue chicken,
I need a little help with that one.
- You passed out.
- Who wouldn't?
The coins just need to be papered for the bank.
The condoms and the twists are inventory.
The chicken's Brainy Betty.
I take it Betty's one of the exotics?
She plays tic-tac-toe.
What makes her so brainy?
She wins nine times out of ten.
You want some coffee?
You got a machine for that too?
Half a dozen in the next three counties.
But given the circumstances of your immediate past...
I would suggest the real bean.
You wouldn't happen to have a pair of chinos and a belt, would ya?
"Boo-boo"?
Story of my life.
Wait. Don't forget Lorraine.
Peek's Beauty Academy, right outside Red Grove... near Green Gene's Pickle Factory.
Buy a burger around here, chances are it's Green Gene's under the bun.
Anyway... seein' as the beauty academy was next door to the pickle factory... we always had plenty of people to practice on.
So one day I'm doin' this tint job on this lady... and my instructor comes over and is giving me...
The collar picked up a little perfume... so if you got a suspicious wife,
I'd run some soap through it.
I don't need to worry about that.
Headin' home?
I don't think so.
I got a girlfriend up in Bayview.
That oughta be enough for now.
- You got a coat?
- Yeah.
- Money?
- Sure.
Well, thanks for the eggs.
Everything.
Thanks for the company.
It must get lonely on the road sometimes.
Like anything else, you're born to it.
Well, you're a born listener, that's for sure.
Depends on who's talkin'.
- What's your name?
- Kay.
All right, Kay.
You girls watch yourselves.
- You're sure this is no trouble?
- No use you waitin' seven hours... on a bus to Bayview when I can get you there in two.
I just hate to take ya too far off the beaten path.
There's a man I can see on the way, if you don't mind a detour or two.
- It's greased.
- Huh?
The wristband.
By the way, I get those novelties straight from Korea.
I can do you ten on the dollar, as many as you want.
Bayview's a little south for you, ain't it, Arlis?
Who said anything about Bayview?
'55, '56, somewhere in there.
Eisenhower days.
- Whatever.
- How'd you know about Bayview?
- Reese Davies.
- Who's Reese Davies?
- A moron.
Used to own a movie theater down that way.
At least, his father did, till he died.
Reese ran it into the ground in about 18 months.
I had a couple of cigarette machines in the lobby from his old man's day.
Then when the theater went south,
Reese tried to claim 'em as assets.
It's his wife. Reese's.
Ugly as sin, ain't it?
Maybe some music'll take the bite out of it.
Keep going. Sometimes you can pick up K-MOO drivin' south.
Or here. Big Lake's got a station plays George Jones most afternoons.
You like George Jones?
You spend much time out this way?
Who? Me? No.
Like I said, my girlfriend...
There's no girlfriend.
It's just me.
See, if I hadn't have gotten my money stolen...
I wouldn't have been jumpin' out of the cake, and we never would've met.
And you wouldn't be wastin' time drivin' me back to Bayview.
I'm sorry I lied.
That's all right.
It's just...
I'm really not myself right now.
That's all right.
And I'm married.
That's all right too.
America's number-one shop-at-home television service... bringing you 24 hours of savings, fun and excitement every day.
Jesus. Will you look at this.
Two days.
Think if I'd been gone a week.
If you’re just joining us, you're not too late.
Don't worry. We're alone.
It's always on.
Reese goes through a picture tube every six months.
I make it a rule not to trespass... especially in a man's house
I don't know.
Well, believe me, it's more my house than it is his.
Drop that anywhere.
I'll be right back.
You're welcome to a beer if you can find one.
- I oughta be pushin' off.
- What's that?
I said, "I left my smokes in the truck."
What the hell?
Afternoon, Mr. Davies.
I'm Earl Logan,
Ned Foster's man.
Is that your truck?
Yeah. I mean...
Well, I was wondering if we could get you to move it.
See, it sure would make our job a whole lot easier.
And I need you to sign here 'fore we can start. Watch your finger.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
They're...
Hello? Hubie?
This is Kay Davies.
Does my husband happen to be there?
Don't lie to me, Hubie!
Shit!
What the hell is that in the driveway?
I think that they're lookin' for your husband.
Well, they're not the only ones.
Can I help you?
Ma'am, I need the gentleman's signature so we can begin.
You're not takin' my furniture.
Ma'am, I'm not emotionally involved.
Well, I am!
Christ!
"Boo-boo"?
Since it looks like
I'm not needed here anymore...
Hey, Darlene. You haven't by any chance seen Reese, have you?
You have.
Really?
Who are you?
Never mind, Darlene.
Here he is.
Sorry to bother you.
This don't look like a good time for introductions, so I'm gonna...
Where'd you put that duffel?
There.
I understand all about schedules.
Just give me a minute to get my ducks in line.
Quack, Quack.
Jesus, Kay, where in the hell have you been?
Just what in the hell are you wearin'?
And just who in the hell is this?
You're askin' me Questions?
Exactly what the hell is that truck doin' outside?
Well, if you'd been here, Kay, maybe
I wouldn't have to explain it to ya.
I'm gone two days, and you sell the furniture?
Well, if it makes you feel better,
I sold it two weeks ago.
Well, shit, Reese, that makes me feel a whole lot better.
Look, I don't wanna talk about no goddamn chest of drawers, anyway.
I wanna know who in the hell this man is.
None of your fuckin' business.
Hell, no.
He's in my house with my woman.
- Are you cheatin' with my wife?
- Actually, I just...
That's right, Reese.
Not two hours ago... we were sweatin' over each other in the back room of the Shady 8 Motel.
He don't mind it in the mornin'.
And guess what, Reese.
I haven't showered... or brushed my teeth.
Actually,
I just gave her a ride... in the truck.
Now, you listen to me, darlin'.
There are two men on our front lawn, and they got a job to do.
Now, I'm gonna open that door, and you're gonna let 'em do it.
Ain't that right?
Fuck you.
Go for it, Slick.
You got yourself a real lionheart, Kay.
Fuck my pretty wife now.
Fuck this.
- That's my gun.
- Very good, Reese.
It's your gun, in my hand, pointed at you. Get the picture?
Christ, Kay, you don't even know how to use that thing.
I got a pretty good idea.
Now, Reese, darlin', I suggest you take your sorry ass outside... and tell the gentlemen on the lawn that the deal is off.
I can't do that.
- Christ, Kay!
- Trust me, Reese.
That clock ain't the only thing runnin' out of time.
I took money. I shook hands, Kay.
The deal is done.
How much?
Seven hundred dollars.
- Where is it?
- You know them bills we had to pay!
Shit, Reese, you haven't paid a bill in three years. Where is it?
Kay, I just told you.
For God's sake, Kay.
All right. It's gone.
I lost it.
Poker?
Mostly.
You sell that too?
The piano?
Hell, no. I bought you that for your birthday, Kay.
- All right then. We'll take it.
- Take it?
You got room in the truck there, Arlan?
- Wait just a second here.
- It's Arlis.
You don't even know his name?
For Christ's sake, Kay, what in the hell has happened to you?
Excuse me.
Who's holding the gun here?
You are.
So I guess I can call anybody any damn thing I damn well please.
Am I right?
That's right.
Sorry.
Back there. Your name.
Mixing it up.
That's a horrible thing to do to a person.
You were close enough.
It's just I have a habit of doin' it when I get nervous.
I got so mad at a boss of mine one time, I was screamin' at him... a full three minutes 'fore I realized I was callin' him Leroy... and his name was Ed.
Not even close.
It sort of took the sting out of it.
Scary sometimes.
What's that?
Moments.
Little split-seconds of time where you find yourself capable... of things you would never even think of doing normally.
Like back there, holdin' that gun.
There was a moment when my finger twitched.
Not so you could see.
More like inside, under the skin.
Some crazy little muscle.
And I could've done it. I could've shot him right in the face.
My whole life would've changed in one tiny little second.
It's not in your blood.
Ain't that a kick?
Yeah, it's a real tickler.
You mind tellin' me what you got in here?
Seven years of bad luck, at least what's left.
Well, thank God the furniture's spoken for.
Believe me, sooner or later, he'd have slapped a price tag on my ass.
To hell with him.
He's just taillights to me now.
Not that he didn't leave a few dents behind.
Let me see.
You take a hell of a punch.
Practice makes perfect.
We'll get you some ice.
Arlis, you're tellin'me this now?
I've been settin'here all afternoon.
I've been settin'here for three hours waitin'for you to call.
Rosie, I told ya, something's come up.
Something's come up, huh?
Well, I know what's come up.
You got another woman over there with you, don't you?
- Don't you, Arlis?
- Rosie, listen to me.
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to town, go into a bar... and pick up the first man I see.
I'm gonna pick up the first two men I see.
I don't think that's such a good idea, do you, Rosie?
You know what, Arlis?
I don't care.
Are you still there, or did you hang up on me?
No, I'm still here.
You're sort of an odd fellow, you know that?
You don't ask many Questions... personal, I mean.
I figure people share what they want to.
No sense crowdin' 'em.
Women must love you.
Put that on your face once you're out.
You mind grabbin' me another one of these?
- Ever been married?
- Nope.
Ever been in love?
- Am I crowdin' you?
- No.
- I've never been in love.
- Me either.
What about your husband?
Hell, no. I mean, you saw his hair, right?
Besides, he's no different than any of the others.
I was 13 when the first one pulled my blue jeans off... and ever since, they seem to pass me off, one to another... my whole life.
Like they're all members of the same club or something.
You know, you look good without that hat.
But you're gonna bald.
See how high your peaks are?
That's from wearin' the hat all day.
You have to let your scalp breathe.
Besides, you shouldn't hide your head. You got a nice shape.
I'll keep that in mind.
It's not 'cause of that, is it?
The tattoo?
I bet that was one crazy night.
No more than any other.
Well, whatever.
Nothin' to feel shy about.
You hardly notice it's there.
Come on. Let's go for a little walk, okay?
Why can't you sleep?
The night air usually calms her.
This stuff is awful.
You sure you asked for Cover Girl?
Yes, I asked. They were out.
Well, my skin does not take to this.
How I could forget my beauty bag,
I do not know.
Probably wouldn't fit in the suitcase.
How do you abide this seat?
Ten more miles, my ass'll be flat as a pancake.
Seats take breakin' in.
All right. I get the message.
I'm not usually like this. If we'd met under normal circumstances... you'd probably like me.
Most people do, or I guess they do.
I didn't say I didn't like you.
Hell, I like you.
It's just that there's been a whole lot of... activity in the past couple of days.
I go from one town to the next, you understand?
I see the same faces.
I hear the same talk.
I sleep in the same beds.
I eat the same food.
Then I start all over again.
I like it that way.
I don't like walkin' into people's houses I don't know.
I don't like guns comin' out of nowhere.
I don't like lookin' over my shoulder for angry husbands.
I don't like surprises, period.
You really like me?
What's not to like?
Arlis, that stew of yours... has got to where it's nothin' but potatoes and carrots.
I don't make it, Kyle;
I just stock it.
Hell, Homer and I are about the only ones who buy the damn stuff.
We get up to our elbows in John Deere, we got no choice.
I can go back to the chili if you want.
Shit, no.
We work close enough Quarters in that pit as it is.
All I need is Homer's ass in my face after two cans of that.
Now, I could stand a little of that in my face.
She'd steal you blind.
So old Sam found you, did she?
- Came right up.
- Yeah, she knows the truck.
Here. Introduce yourself.
You like that, don't you?
Better than that scratch old Charley feeds you.
- She'll follow you all day now.
- What happened to her throat?
She ran herself through a fence couple of years back... tore herself up pretty good.
- Hey, girl.
- But you're still here, ain't ya?
You ride?
Once or twice. County fairs, stuff like that.
You?
Once or twice.
I bet you can't swim neither.
That?
Beginner's luck.
Well, there was a cowboy a while back who showed me a thing or two.
Comin' in?
I'm fine.
Suit yourself.
So who showed you about horses?
When I was about 12, 13, I worked at a little horse farm like this.
I shoveled stalls during the day, got a roof over my head at night.
Well, where was your mother?
She died.
How 'bout your father?
Long story.
He still alive?
You ask all your cowboys this many Questions?
Why don't you come on in here and cool off?
We gotta go.
I don't wanna go.
Storm's comin'.
There's no storm.
I can feel it.
How come some of them are blue?
- Those dimes?
- They're juke dimes.
Juke dimes?
What's that?
I give the boss man a roll of these, he'll start up a jukebox.
You play your own jukebox?
That don't make sense.
People don't make sense.
Man walks into a place with a jukebox, right?
Nine times out of ten, if that box isn't already playin'... he'll be shy about startin' it up or won't even know it's there.
But you get it goin' for him... nine times out of ten, he'll keep it goin'... with his own money.
Trick of the trade.
How come you paint 'em blue?
This keeps 'em separate from the boss man's money, that's all.
You go east...
Billy Breckins paints his green.
Drop down two counties...
Buddy Clarke, his are red.
Me, I'm just partial to blue.
You could use a trim.
I got a man in Blackwell does me every third Wednesday of the month.
I could do ya.
A couple of snips here.
Couple there.
I think your hands are a couple of beers past steady.
Yeah, I'd do you better blind than you been gettin'.
Your man in Blackwell doesn't understand your head.
Besides, I'm not drunk.
I know exactly what I'm doin'.
Looks like you were right... about that storm.
What?
Nothing.
What? Did you say something?
Is there somebody out there?
Shit!
Maybe it's Reese come.
Jesus.
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry to bother you, but the night man's gone to bed... and I'm having some trouble with my car.
You try the bell?
- The bell?
- For the night man.
Sure, but no one came.
And no one along here would open their door to me.
- You're the only one.
- What's wrong with your car?
Hell if I know.
I am lost when it comes to anything mechanical.
But you look like you might know something about motors.
Am I right?
- You got the keys?
- Inside.
- You got it in gear.
- What?
You got it in gear.
Well, damn.
You'd follow a mouse into the mouth of a snake... wouldn't you, Junior?
He's hurt bad.
Hurt bad?
Honey, I cut my lip worse than this when I'm whistlin'.
See, it's just that
I can't fix it myself... and my sweet pea there, she don't know how.
How long has it been, boy?
Well, long time... no see.
Ugly little bastards, ain't they?
How's it look?
I've seen worse.
Yeah, I guess my whole life's back there.
A good portion of yours too, huh, son?
Be glad it's just bird seed chasing you this time.
Not like that night in Kilgore, huh?
Hell, come winter... it get cold enough... the pinch'll get somethin' fierce.
Sometimes you can't get it all out.
Sometimes you got to carry it with you.
Now, don't get me wrong.
You was always a good boy.
You always did what you was told.
Well, most of the time.
I managed to raise the night man, and I have a key...
Shit!
Shouldn't we get a doctor?
Little darlin', I don't believe there's a pill peddler alive... got a better touch than my boy here.
And best of all, he don't ask no Questions.
Practice makes perfect.
You got an injured man here, boy.
Easy, easy.
That's nice.
That's nice, that smell.
You've got the smell of love on you, boy.
Tell me... does she taste as good?
Come here, boy.
Get your father's boots off.
That's the least a son can do... till he's ready to wear them himself.
Get yourself out of those clothes before you catch a chill.
Don't worry yourself.
I never caught anything in my life.
Everybody catches something.
Not me.
Well, I broke a finger once... but I don't figure that counts.
Shit.
This is too fucking weird.
Wish I could say the same.
I'm always catching a cold.
Had one just last month.
I'm sorry to hear it.
You can't sleep in those.
Find yourself something of mine.
I'll hang yours up to dry.
Come on.
What's your name?
Ginnie.
With a J or a G?
You plannin' on writin' me a letter?
All right, keep it a mystery.
It's a nice name either way.
Yeah, well...
I'm not a nice girl.
But I'll bet that you are, aren't you?
I'd like to think so.
And the guy who did that to your face... did he think you were nice?
Not at the time.
But you stay with him anyway, don't you?
Who, Arlis?
He didn't do this to me.
He's not like that at all.
Don't kid yourself.
Eventually, they are all like that... evil.
But once you know that... you can turn it back against 'em.
Use it.
Arlis doesn't have an evil bone in his body.
But...
What?
I don't know.
I get the feeling... he's been close to it, felt the heat of it.
I think that you're the one that's felt the heat of it.
And not too long ago at that.
There's a pretty cotton nightshirt in there with tulips on it.
I know you'll love that.
You don't exactly travel light, do you?
Long story.
Take anything you want.
Well, how about this?
That was my mother's.
I'm sorry.
This her?
She's pretty.
Yeah, I guess she was.
Fuck.
You lookin' for something?
Three guesses.
I had some serious shit in that car.
- Your shit's still in it.
- You mind telling me where?
Across the tracks over there in Mesquite.
You mind telling me why?
Anybody see you last night?
Last night? No.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Are you deaf?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Then whose pepper was I pickin' out of my father's shoulder?
That?
Some half-wit pump owner... stumbled onto us in the rain, took a wild shot and hit something.
It was fluke luck.
Nobody saw the car.
I guess I just wasted my time.
I guess you did.
I'm his kin, you understand?
I got no choice.
So don't think this is some game that you're playin'.
Last night, it could have just as easily been you out there... bleedin' in the rain.
Only difference is, he'd have left you behind... or finished the job himself.
Well, shit.
No wonder old black eyes loves you.
You wouldn't have the balls to shoo a fly off a steak.
Warm you boys up?
Is that one at a time or both together?
You're a little devil, aren't you?
I'd damn sure put the curl in your hair if you'd give me half a chance.
I don't need a man for that.
- There you go.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Oh, my God.
Where you from?
Why do you wanna know that?
Who gave her that mask?
Does it matter?
I suppose you're right.
People get what they deserve.
What do you want?
- If it's money, l...
- Money?
Money? Hey, boy...
I don't need your money.
Well, why are you here?
I got shot. You fixed me up.
I'm havin' some eggs.
Does that seem strange?
Just like old times, huh?
Just coincidence.
I had a loose end to take care of up north Oklahoma way... around Ardmore, them parts.
An associate of mine... got a little greedy.
Started threatenin'.
Started to weigh on me... stole my sleep, and you know how I feel about loose ends.
Being one myself.
That's true, isn't it, Junior?
He bought me lunch, and... he bought me a pack of cigarettes.
After Oklahoma, I was working north, drifted on down... and run into this little girl over here.
And I saw her... switching tickets at this diner in Cherry Spring.
She had a full rancher's breakfast, and she pulled a switch... with this little old lady had coffee and a piece of pie.
Little low-rent for you, ain't it?
Well, it was the way she did it.
Smooth as glass.
Real nerve.
Well, at least you won't go hungry.
Well... she's a little bigger than that.
The last couple months, she's been runnin' this slick little game.
Thing of beauty.
She steals from the dead.
She's been sloppy about it, of course.
Would've got caught if I hadn't come along.
But she's got grit in spades.
I'll have to watch my back with this one.
Heart beats about twice a minute.
At least it beats.
Don't you kid yourself, Junior.
You see, you and me... we're flesh and bone.
The same blood that runs my veins... runs yours.
- You seen my duffle?
- Maybe in the truck.
What happened last night... with your father?
He just has a habit of puttin' himself... at the wrong place at the wrong time.
What's all that?
She hardly has a thing to wear from what I gather.
Lord knows I got enough.
Besides, most of these are full of bad memories.
Not too many spring picnics here.
This may not be none of my business, but...
I run into that little scarecrow you got... runnin' that north territory up there.
- Did he mention that?
- He mentioned it.
Yeah.
- His name Eddie?
- Elliot.
Elliot, right.
He's a nervous little son of a bitch, ain't he?
Got a real strange way of walkin'.
Them ankles so close together.
You ever notice things like that?
What's your point?
Well... it might not be my place.
It looked to me like he's stealin' from you, son.
Elliot's an honest man.
You sure know him better than I do.
But it's just that, you see...
I watched him at this fillin' station outside of Paint Rock.
This one afternoon, he had him two sacks... and he was runnin' Quarters in the both of them.
I guess it don't take no great genius... to count Clark Bars and figure out that you're short.
He has been short, hasn't he?
Short don't mean he's stealin'.
No, I guess not.
But then again, what else would it mean?
Bye, y'all.
You sure you're fit to travel?
Hell, this ain't nothin', darlin'.
I'm what you call a Quick healer.
You ask Arlis there.
I'd wreck my shoulder on a Sunday... and still give him a smack on a Monday.
Ain't that right, son?
There's a Texaco station about ten miles east.
That'll be your last chance for a while.
I appreciate that.
Truly, l... Except I think we're gonna head up north there... around Benson County.
You remember Benson County, don't you, Junior?
I'm just needlin' him.
Boy always hated it up there.
Them locusts liked to drive him crazy. You take care, now.
Get yourself packed.
We're leavin'.
It's funny. I'd have never put it together... him and you.
If I'd met you separate,
I'd never see the tie.
I guess we don't get much choice in it, do we?
What was all that talk about Benson County?
Just talk.
I don't remember the locusts at all.
Pass me that bottle again, will ya?
We finished the last we had.
We or you?
What's the difference?
It's gone.
Next place you see, you stop.
You're the boss.
That's strange.
What?
Look at that house up there.
Looks familiar.
Sure, that's the one in the photograph.
Photograph?
The one that lady had.
I saw it in her suitcase when
I went looking for a nightshirt.
- You're wrong.
- No.
That roof was just the same.
And the trees. And the windmill...
There's dozens of houses look just like that up here.
I'm positive.
No one has lived in that house for years.
Well, looks like it was a nice place once.
I think whoever lived there would have kept it up.
Not that house.
What do you mean?
Years ago, they say some Mexican... shot the man he was working for... and then shot the whole family right after.
Jesus.
I mean, that's the story I heard.
It changes over the years.
Who knows what the truth is anymore?
No matter what the story is, it all comes back to one thing.
What's that?
Well, the house.
They say it's haunted.
But then,
I don't believe in ghosts.
All right, Darlene. Thanks.
No, I'm glad you told me.
Yeah, you too.
Bye.
I can't believe it.
He filed for divorce, Reese did.
I'm sorry.
Sorry? I'm just amazed he could do the paperwork by himself.
I wanna celebrate.
Celebrate?
Yeah, I feel free... for the first time in my life,
I think, and I wanna celebrate.
I wanna put on a pretty dress, get you out of that damn hat... and go have a nice big fat steak.
What do you say?
Any suggestions?
Try C-17.
C-17.
How come this place is closed in the middle of the week?
Pete's boy plays baseball for the local school.
Anytime Tommy's set to pitch,
Pete throws a lock on the place... and he rides the bus with the team.
That's how come I got the key.
He must trust you.
I guess he does.
You play this for all the girls, old C-17?
First time.
You an honest man, Arlis Sweeney?
Yes, ma'am.
You like the dress?
I like the dress.
You like the girl?
I'd say she's the prettiest one in the room.
Pretty enough to dance with?
Well...
Now, don't tell me you don't.
Well, don't you think it's about time you learned?
Dancin'... frees the soul.
Howdy, partner.
That's all I get after last night?
Mornin'.
Good mornin', darlin'.
Why don't you shake on into the kitchen... and crack me a beer?
Need some help?
Get me two cases of Milky Ways by 9:00 a. M...
'cause that's what my hired man's gonna be lookin' to take with him... back to Crockett County.
I haven't even got me one case.
Hell, I ain't got a Milky Way, period.
Well, I'm sure the good people of Crockett County... can do without a Milky Way for a day or two.
It's my job, all right?
We're a little surly in the morning, aren't we?
That's okay.
It runs in my family too.
What's that?
The morning bear.
I said it runs in my family too.
What else runs in your family?
Your family.
You never talk about 'em.
Believe me, there's a lot more interesting things to talk about... than my family.
I already told you everything that's worth tellin' anyway.
Besides, I haven't seen them in years.
Not since I got married.
But when you were a kid growin' up, what were they like?
What'd your mother do?
What'd your father do?
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you were crowdin' me.
Maybe you don't know me.
What'd my father do?
Drink mostly. Gamble.
Lost everything we had eventually.
That's how I met Reese.
Went to go collect my father one night at this place in the woods... where there was always an all-night game... and there they were, sittin' shoulder-to-shoulder... two drunks...
Losing money faster than one sober fool ever could.
Of course, I was a real fool.
Ended up takin' Reese home.
Stayed to make his breakfast.
Never left.
Why the sudden interest?
Nothin'. I'm just...
I happened to see that photograph... in your suitcase.
Well, that's not me.
It is me, but it isn't.
See, my parents...
The only parents I've ever known... are really my aunt and uncle by blood.
I mean... the people in the photograph
I never knew.
They were lost when I was a baby.
Killed.
Car accident.
Car accident?
When I was old enough to know, I was given the picture and told about it.
I don't know why I hang onto it.
It's just...
You grow up in an ugly house the way I did... sometimes you wonder how it might have been... if things hadn't happened the way they did.
It's funny.
Your father the other day... mentioned Benson County.
That's where they lived,
I'm pretty sure.
The people in the picture.
My family.
I'm about ready.
Listen.
I think maybe it'd be better you stay here.
Stay here?
While I run up the road to tend to Elliot.
There's some money over there.
Get yourself something to eat while l... while I'm gone.
Well, they must make one hell of a Spanish omelette.
All right, I'll wait for ya.
You don't want to be going anywhere without this.
Earl's Truck Stop over in Coke County... run out of Cheez-Its again.
Cheez-Its and truckers.
They sure go together.
And Phil Pritchard wants you to ring him up... about puttin' another Coke machine in his ice rink.
I can't figure why he waited so long.
- Two years I've been tellin' him.
- You're a little light here.
Yeah, well, I had trouble with the Mexicans again.
They hurt the machines?
Nothin' I couldn't put right with a crowbar.
I had to replace the brace on one.
Slung it with... a three-Quarter inch York.
- That should solve your problem.
- Should.
But those boys are strong.
Hell knows I couldn't pop her.
- Without the key?
- Yeah.
Well, that's what I meant... without the key.
You look like you had one too many cups of coffee, Elliot.
It's the chill, I guess.
Are you stealin' from me?
You know I did time in Big Spring.
I told you that right off day we met.
But I did the time.
I'm out now... and I want to stay that way.
I'm not sure that answers my Question.
You don't know...
'cause you've never been in trouble.
But once you been in trouble... and people know it... you feel guilty for things you never done.
Just because you know... they think you got it in you.
That potential.
Is that why your hands are shaking?
That's why my hands are shaking.
I like my job, Arlis.
I like you.
I like you too, Elliot.
I'll see you next week.
And Elliot, that business about the machines...
It ain't the Mexicans.
Up there they blame everything on the Mexicans.
We asked 100 women this question.
Give me the most popular answer... from the 100 women who answered.
Tell me a reason why women leave their husbands.
Infidelity.
Did our women say infidelity?
It's number one!
Who needs him anyway?
Stardust Motel.
Emma, it's Arlis.
Ring 12 for me, will you?
Not unless you wanna talk to
Theresa. She's pulling the sheets.
Speaking of which, what do you want me to do with the suitcase?
Suitcase?
I'll have Jimmy put it in
Maintenance. Just give me the word.
I don't follow you.
Where's the lady?
Gone. Been gone about an hour now.
They just got in the car and left.
They? Who's they?
She and her friend.
A young lady in sunglasses.
A real stinger, that one.
Asked me for directions three times... then liked to take half the guest mints from the bowl.
I swear, some people just have no manners.
They say where they were goin'?
Up north, I guess. The young one had gotten turned around.
Wanted to know how to get back on the farm route.
That doesn't help much. They could be anywhere in the county.
It suits you... the dress.
Well, you can have it back if that's what you mean.
I'm just sayin' it suits you, that's all.
You might think about doin' something with your hair.
You got a nice face.
You should let the boys see it.
It ain't my face the boys wanna see.
Maybe you haven't met the right boy.
- And you have?
- I thought so.
Last night, at least, but now l...
I don't know what to think.
Look, you can't figure men.
So don't run yourself ragged tryin'.
I guess. I don't know why he just didn't call me himself.
I told you, it's a surprise.
I don't even know what's goin' on myself.
I'm just doin' what I was told.
Well, here we are.
This is where we're goin'?
I don't...
Oh, my God.
Surprise.
Howdy.
She's some old dame, ain't she?
Look at that face, sweet pea.
Does that break your heart?
To pieces.
First time you've seen it?
- How did he know?
- What's that now?
The house.
How did he know where it was?
Oh, Arlis.
He knows a lot more than he lets on.
Anyway, sweet pea saw it and... said something about a photograph.
- That about right?
- Right.
Where is he?
He'll be along.
Say, you wanna take a little look inside there, look around?
Well, go on.
But you be careful, now.
Watch yourself, especially on them stairs there.
There's more termites than there is timber by now.
How was the movie?
I got here as fast as I could.
You talk to that clerk there at the motel?
Dropped enough crumbs for a flock of geese.
That's ten minutes.
Where the hell you been?
She had to pee twice... and I had to make a little stop of my own.
I know how grim you get, you don't get your breakfast.
You're smarter than I thought.
I'm not smart enough to figure out what we're doin'... wastin' our time out here in cracker land.
I'm gonna tell you all about loose ends some day.
And you'll want to listen careful.
You look like you've seen a ghost there, Junior.
I hope you brought some food.
You all right?
Hell, he's fine. Just fine.
Cat's got his tongue is all.
Come on up.
There's something I wanna show you.
Watch your step, son.
It's like heaven, isn't it?
My mother must have stood right here... brushin' her hair... daydreamin'.
I think I figured it out.
I must've slept in here... or there.
No. In front.
In those days, houses like these... they used to put the baby in the front of the house.
That way, if a woman was hangin' laundry and the baby cried... she could hear.
Maybe my mother hung laundry out back.
Sun's strongest in the front.
You seem to know more about me than I do, so why don't you tell me.
Were my parents good people?
Were they nice to baby Kay?
I'm sure they were.
- What makes you so sure?
- 'Cause you're good people.
And good people come from good people.
Ain't that right, son?
- That's right.
- I'm not so sure that's true.
But it's nice of you to say.
No, I'm...
I'm not just saying it.
I know it, and that's a fact.
I'm gonna go outside.
That's a good idea.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you take Ginnie while you're at it?
She's probably down there bitin' on her nails by now.
- I'll go with you.
- No.
I need to talk to you.
Father to son, you know.
Let the girls get some wind in their hair.
We could walk for days, I bet, and never see anything but this.
Wouldn't that be a thrill.
See, it was the girl, sweet pea, that first mentioned it... the house being the same and all.
I thought she had it all wrong, naturally.
See, I knew I never seen this woman of yours before...
'cause I never forget a face.
But...
Still, there was something doggin' me. A sound.
Halfway to Shreveport, I see a lady standin' by the side of the road.
A mother.
And that's when I knew what it was.
That sound in my head... her cryin'.
You see, I had forgotten... about the baby.
What's that sound?
You hear it?
Bugs.
She doesn't know.
There's no reason for her to know, no reason for me to tell her.
I realize that.
I truly, truly do.
But this woman, she's different.
See, I noticed that the first time I seen her.
The way she looked at you and the way you looked at her.
It was touching, truly.
She'll never know.
I swear it on my life.
Damn, I wish I could believe that.
But as much as we are the same... you've always been a little too emotional.
I left her this mornin'.
I only came back 'cause of you.
This little game.
This ain't no game, Junior.
You know me better than that.
I must be out of my fuckin' mind.
It's not gonna change, you know!
They don't grow this stuff but one color.
It's a shame, really.
She's so sweet.
Almost innocent.
She is innocent. But I'm not.
Take me... and she can't know.
I couldn't do that.
What kind of man would that make me?
A man who'd shoot his own kin.
I couldn't sleep with that, and I do prize my sleep.
There's really only one Question here, son.
Do I do it... or you?
I could hear 'em.
You don't mind if I smoke, do you?
You know how I always enjoyed a good cigar.
That's what separates me from other men... I can tell the difference.
A good cigar's not what separates you from other men.
What separates you, Junior?
You fuck their wives?
I don't shoot their children.
You'd done what you were told, there would have been no blood that night.
I didn't pull the trigger.
But you opened the door, and they were supposed to be asleep.
And you know they're always supposed to be asleep.
Besides, wasn't me that shot first.
I had no choice.
And the boy?
Did he have a choice?
Fuck that little boy!
He almost got your daddy killed.
We had one bad night.
It was 30 years ago.
There was more than one bad night.
But that was your night, wasn't it, Junior?
You're right.
You didn't pull the trigger.
You did open the door.
And now, you brung her to me.
You're stupid.
You've always been stupid.
You was stupid when you were a little kid.
As a man, shit, you're being stupid now.
Who's got the gun, boy? Me?
Go ahead, son.
Put it on me and pull the trigger.
Come on.
See, you can't.
You just can't.
You can't because we're kin.
Blood.
Look, you go ahead and run along and fill up them candy machines.
It's only right that I do it.
This way, we both will sleep easy.
Dad?
Son?
Sweet dreams.
- What happened?
- Get in the truck.
- But...
- Get in the truck!
Everything he told you... it's a lie.
Thanks for the advice.
Don't be in a hurry to leave.
They know me here for years, so you just stay as long as you want.
Until you figure out your next step.
You got your key?
Yeah.
I got my key.
What was I doin' in that house today?
Or am I crowdin' you?
There are some things that... are better left unsaid.
It just does no good to talk about 'em.
No good at all.
It's like I said.
I'm a creature of habit.
Each town I go, there's a place to eat... place to sleep.
And in each town, there's also a woman.
I'm startin' to miss 'em.
Sure, I understand.
I just sort of fell into your life anyway.
There wasn't any reason to it.
God knows I've been a burden.
It's just...
I really haven't been myself these last few days.
Yes, you have.
You've been fine.
Better than fine.
Looks like they're almost gone.
The bruises.
I better go.
I got a jukebox up the road that's only playin' George Jones.
That ain't so bad.
I guess not.
I stumble on any of those blue dimes of yours... maybe I'll use a couple of'em... give you a call, let you know how I'm doin'.
You know where to find me.
What's that on your pocket?
That's nothin'.
It's just a little blood.
{{{the end}}}
{6451}{6544}Captain! Captain!
{6642}{6714}Captain, my crates.|Have you loaded my crates?
{6717}{6759}They can't go.|They have to come off.
{6762}{6822}- Who the hell are you?|- My name is John Whitney.
{6825}{6898}The crates, they're consigned|to the Natural History Museum in Chicago.
{6901}{6966}- Just tell me if they're onboard.|- Crates is all we have onboard, senor.
{6969}{7058}No, they have to come off.|This is extremely important.
{7061}{7127}Nothing comes off after customs|has been on, senor.
{7130}{7226}- That's more important.|- Look. Look, I'll take care of you, all right?
{7229}{7323}If you'll just get the manifest.|The Natural History Museum in Chicago.
{7326}{7377}- Please, compadre.|- I don't have time for this.
{7380}{7452}I have to get my ship out of the harbor.|I'm eight hours late,
{7455}{7489}and there's weather coming in.
{7492}{7566}Don't worry, senor.|We'll take good care of your crates.
{10405}{10485}6 WEEKS LATER
{11030}{11085}Morning, Lieutenant.|Coast Guard found it early this morning.
{11088}{11181}Don't really know how long it's been there|or how it got there.
{11184}{11231}- What are those?|- The old coal tunnels.
{11234}{11328}There was a time when 30 coal barges a day|would come into this slip.
{11331}{11382}I'm touched.|Who the hell is onboard?
{11385}{11449}- Hollingsworth.|- Wonderful.
{11481}{11554}Morning, Lieutenant.|Just been to the front of the boat.
{11557}{11595}I got something to show you.
{11598}{11717}It's a ship, Hollingsworth, not a boat.|And the pointy end is the bow.
{11720}{11786}Custody hearing went badly?
{11789}{11826}I don't want to talk about it.
{11829}{11882}She got Jerry?
{11897}{11981}What part of "I don't want to talk about it"|is unclear?
{11984}{12084}- Oh, shit.|- His ex-wife got custody of his son?
{12089}{12147}- His dog.|- His dog?
{12150}{12221}Yeah, he really loves that dog.
{12253}{12349}The ship's registered out of Brazil.|Came down through the seaway.
{12352}{12412}Paperwork looks legit.
{12509}{12604}It's blood.|Lab's checking it for type.
{12638}{12720}- Any bodies?|- Nope. Not a one.
{12725}{12755}When the Coast Guard found it,
{12758}{12803}it was floundering|in the middle of Lake Michigan.
{12806}{12886}So they towed it in, and nobody knows|how long it had been like that.
{12889}{12950}- You checked the manifest?|- We're doing it now.
{12953}{13046}- Bring in the dogs?|- The drug unit's been over the whole thing.
{13049}{13146}I told them it was a waste of time.|I mean, this was obviously a drug hit.
{13149}{13223}Whatever they came for, they found.
{13226}{13325}Now, I figure they came aboard at night,|they killed everyone,
{13328}{13381}and they threw the bodies overboard.
{13384}{13452}You figured all that out by yourself?
{13455}{13527}- Holy shit!|- What?
{13530}{13602}- What?|- Cat. Nearly gave me a heart attack.
{13605}{13680}- Was it a black cat?|- No.
{13756}{13812}What's that smell?
{13851}{13913}- Is the bilge below here?|- I think so.
{13916}{13959}Give me that.
{13965}{14024}Give me a hand here.
{14035}{14086}What a stink!
{14284}{14337}Jesus Christ.
{14741}{14799}1 WEEK LATER|- Let's all stay together.
{14802}{14914}Please walk! Walk!|Walk, children. Walk!
{14917}{15034}Walk. Please, walk. Walk.|Let's all stay together.
{15037}{15087}- I say we go.|- Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.
{15090}{15152}We finally cut school|and you wanna go to a museum.
{15155}{15198}Maybe afterwards we could go to a library.
{15201}{15279}They've got mummies in there,|eyeballs in jars, dead stuff.
{15282}{15326}See, man, I don't know about this stuff.
{15329}{15423}Look, we can go in with them,|check it out, split.
{15426}{15486}I mean, we can't go|to an arcade yet anyway.
{15489}{15519}We'd be noticed.
{15522}{15612}- So, what are you, scared?|- No, I'm not scared!
{15909}{15959}Hey, didn't your parents teach you|not to stare?
{15962}{16022}Didn't yours teach you|not to get dressed in the street?
{16025}{16086}- Good morning, Dr. Green.|- Good morning.
{16089}{16146}- Doctor?|- What kind of a doctor are you?
{16149}{16213}I'm an evolutionary biologist.
{16216}{16240}What's that?
{16243}{16314}Someone trying to figure out|where our tails went.
{16317}{16358}Your teacher's|gonna be looking for you.
{16361}{16425}Oh, yeah. Come on, Eugene.
{16432}{16591}Kids, do not run. Walk. Walk. Easy.|Do not run, walk.
{16612}{16701}Walk, kids. Walk.
{16740}{16775}- Walk.|- Good morning, Dr. Green.
{16778}{16830}- Good morning, Fred.|- These kids are driving me crazy.
{16833}{16916}Careful.|They're our future benefactors.
{16981}{17056}Margo, I need to speak with you|about your grant.
{17059}{17126}- You've heard already?|- I've heard something.
{17129}{17193}- I didn't get it.|- No. It's not that bad.
{17196}{17300}It's just that the Blaisedale Foundation|has decided to delay their decision.
{17303}{17447}- Delay? Why?|- Greg Lee is applying for the same grant.
{17450}{17493}Greg?
{17513}{17593}- I thought he had his grant.|- Well, he's going after another one.
{17596}{17657}Can he do that? Another one?
{17660}{17729}I mean, doesn't he realize|that I have to shut down my work
{17732}{17838}- if I don't get that money?|- I don't suppose he's thought about that.
{17841}{17908}- Slimy bastard.|- Margo, have a little faith in yourself.
{17911}{17975}- You're better than he is.|- Faith?
{17978}{18063}Come on. It's not the end of the world.|It's just a little competition.
{18066}{18123}You've got the gala coming up|night after next,
{18126}{18174}and the Blaisedales|are going to be here.
{18177}{18226}- You know? The Blaisedales.|- Yes.
{18229}{18294}So put on your party dress,|and I'll introduce you,
{18297}{18378}and you show them|just how bright you are.
{18381}{18444}I just want to do my work.
{18448}{18500}You know, Greg will be there,
{18503}{18602}attaching himself to the Blaisedales|like a crustacean.
{18724}{18780}Donna, did you get the gecko|and lizard samples loaded?
{18783}{18839}It's through the replicator.|We got a big sample.
{18842}{18909}Great. Hey, Charlie.|Did we get the database back online?
{18912}{18974}It's online, but I don't know|for how long. - Good.
{18977}{19065}- Hello, Greg. How nice to see you!|- Margo.
{19069}{19152}- How's the old research going?|- Fine. I'm just a little bit busy.
{19155}{19224}Could there be anything special|that you'd like to tell me?
{19227}{19307}Of course not. 'Cause if there was,|you would've just come out and told me.
{19310}{19359}I have every right to apply|for any grant.
{19362}{19446}So you go behind my back|and apply for my grant?
{19449}{19534}- There's nothing wrong with that.|- It's not your grant until you get it.
{19537}{19638}If I don't get it, I'm out of work.|My staff is out of work.
{19641}{19751}- You shouldn't take it so personally.|- You really are a gerbil.
{20407}{20479}Margo. Well, this is a surprise.
{20482}{20558}- I was just... I thought...|- I asked Margo to join us, Ann.
{20561}{20628}- I hope you don't mind.|- Oh, no. Of course not.
{20631}{20700}No word from John yet,|but these crates arrived this morning.
{20703}{20811}They were supposed to be on a ship|except there was some mix-up in Brazil,
{20814}{20878}and they never made it.|They were sent by air freight.
{20881}{20931}Here, here. Take a look at this.
{20934}{21006}- The Kothoga.|- Could be.
{21009}{21048}And what does this god|specialize in?
{21051}{21150}South American tribe, the Zenzera,|long thought to be extinct.
{21153}{21248}They made a deal with satan|to vanquish their enemies.
{21251}{21353}So, Kothoga was born, son of satan.|You have that look again, Margo.
{21356}{21418}Why do we keep financing|John Whitney's expeditions,
{21421}{21466}as if superstition|were the same thing as science?
{21469}{21564}Anthropologists are permitted|to believe in myth. It's part of their job.
{21567}{21677}In any case, our superstition exhibit|is excellent box office for this museum,
{21680}{21718}and that benefits you, as well.
{21721}{21783}Using superstition|to bring people to the museum
{21786}{21863}is like hiring topless ushers|for the Bolshoi Ballet.
{21866}{21915}Well, if they did,|I might go to the ballet.
{21918}{21991}Do you really think the restoration|department can do something with this?
{21994}{22054}Certainly.|Possibly even for the opening.
{22057}{22085}What was in this other crate?
{22088}{22143}Except for the packing leaves,|it was empty.
{22146}{22243}Empty? Well, was there a packing list?|There must've been something in here.
{22246}{22330}Crates were nailed shut|when they arrived.
{22403}{22458}- Strange.|- What?
{22478}{22543}Do you think these are eggs?
{22546}{22683}More like fungus. Probably parasitical.|Best not to take any chances.
{22686}{22804}Quite right. Let's see to having those leaves|and crates incinerated.
{22987}{23051}Of course you can, Margo.
{23291}{23432}Attention, please. The museum|will be closing in 15 minutes. Thank you.
{23832}{23883}Hey, man, this stuff is so cool.
{23886}{24008}- I don't think we're supposed to be here.|- Don't be such a wuss, Eugene.
{24012}{24107}Attention, please.|The museum is now closed.
{24125}{24225}Attention, please.|The museum is now closed.
{24228}{24274}We're gonna get in big trouble.
{24277}{24363}What do you think they're gonna do?|Put us in the museum jail?
{25503}{25588}Johnson? Davis? That you?
{26711}{26790}Dr. Green,|I've worked myself to the bone.
{26793}{26890}Please let me go home.|I need to rest.
{26961}{27042}All right, you guys.|You can finish tomorrow morning.
{27045}{27103}Go on. Take a hike.
{27270}{27392}Why don't we just start yelling?|Someone will show us the way out of here.
{27424}{27529}And call our moms and let them know|that we cut class.
{27532}{27592}Great idea, butt wipe.
{27669}{27710}Hey, man, there's a really cool|staircase back here.
{27713}{27820}- No, let's just get out of here.|- What are you, scared?
{28458}{28530}Hello? Is someone there?
{28723}{28832}Josh? Josh, where are you?
{28873}{28916}Josh.
{28954}{29025}Josh, come on. This isn't funny.
{29197}{29289}- You goofball. You almost wet your pants.|- Josh.
{29355}{29418}Quiet. Do you hear something?
{29421}{29487}- What is it?|- I don't know.
{29547}{29607}- Let's just go.|- Yeah.
{29629}{29706}- You smell something?|- You farted, didn't you?
{29709}{29762}No, not lately.
{29965}{30027}Let's get out of here.
{30431}{30486}That's terrific.
{30518}{30558}Hang on to your fucking hat,|Lieutenant.
{30561}{30630}I want to interview every employee|whether they worked yesterday or not.
{30633}{30700}If they did work, I want the hours,|what part of the building,
{30703}{30757}if they saw the victim,|what time and where.
{30760}{30814}Who was the last person|to leave the building yesterday?
{30817}{30917}- A Dr. Green.|- Good. I want to talk to him.
{30961}{31010}- Did you hear?|- No.
{31013}{31117}- I'm guessing you're gonna tell me.|- Someone's been killed.
{31161}{31219}- Murder.|- Oh, my god.
{31222}{31316}They're not telling us who. All I know is|they cut off the whole basement level.
{31319}{31345}Murdered?
{31348}{31441}I'm betting it was Colonel Mustard|with a candlestick.
{31470}{31592}What? What are you thinking?|You think I'm an asshole, right? Is that it?
{31596}{31646}- Are you Dr. Green?|- Yes, I am.
{31649}{31704}Could you come with me, please?
{31707}{31758}- It's okay, honey.|- I understand...
{31761}{31837}- It's gonna be all right.|- All right, that's good. All right.
{31840}{31907}Take them both to the 15th.|I want detailed statements
{31910}{31953}in the presence of a psychologist.
{31956}{32003}Museum security wants to know|if they can open the doors.
{32006}{32054}No. Check to see|if they got anything on video.
{32057}{32104}I did that, sir. They don't have|surveillance cameras down here.
{32107}{32179}- Can I help you?|- Lieutenant D'Agosta wants to see me.
{32182}{32250}- He does?|- This is Dr. Green.
{32253}{32326}Yeah. Dr. Green, I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.|I wanted to ask you some questions,
{32329}{32388}but I'm fresh on the scene here.|Can I find you later?
{32391}{32427}- Can I go to my lab?|- Not yet.
{32430}{32486}We'll clear the work areas|as soon as we can.
{32489}{32582}- What am I supposed to do?|- Enjoying your mochas, gentlemen?
{32585}{32636}- The smell!|- Take it outside, Martini.
{32639}{32693}I'm okay. I'm okay.
{32937}{33009}- This look familiar to you?|- Yep.
{33050}{33098}This is not good.
{33101}{33166}Never thought there was a worse way to die|than a shark attack.
{33169}{33229}Having my head ripped off|never occurred to me.
{33232}{33285}- Where is his head?|- It's over there by the sink.
{33288}{33368}Lieutenant D'Agosta...|Oh, my god!
{33380}{33437}Get her out of here.
{33447}{33508}Lieutenant, over here.
{33512}{33624}No, don't step over it.|It's bad luck.
{33635}{33669}Jesus Christ.
{33672}{33724}There's a half-burnt joint|on the floor.
{33727}{33808}Seems our boy was having|a little pot on the potty.
{33822}{33922}Pot's a misdemeanor.|Decapitation seems a bit severe.
{33981}{34076}I want the blood on the walls.|Get a ballistic analysis.
{34079}{34188}Pinpoint source, speed, force,|full splatter pattern.
{34272}{34328}Sweep in teams of two.|Nobody goes in alone.
{34331}{34440}This place is not gonna open|until every room is clear. Now, go.
{34469}{34532}Now, the question is,|what does a museum guard
{34535}{34606}have to do with a drug hit|on a South American ship?
{34609}{34689}- I don't know.|- The answer is, maybe nothing.
{34813}{34942}Dr. Cuthbert. Lieutenant|Vincent D'Agosta, Chicago homicide.
{34945}{35018}Lieutenant, this is Tom Parkinson,|our director of security.
{35021}{35077}Have you identified the victim,|Lieutenant Augustino?
{35080}{35115}D'Agosta.
{35118}{35164}Victim's name is Frederick Ford.
{35167}{35247}Freddy Ford?|What a terrible, terrible thing.
{35250}{35315}Yeah. I'd say somebody was|really pissed off at him.
{35318}{35349}Any thoughts on who that might be?
{35352}{35416}No. He was a very sweet man.|I have no idea.
{35419}{35443}I hardly knew the guy.
{35446}{35539}Lieutenant, I don't mean to downplay|the horror of this tragedy
{35542}{35630}or the urgency of your investigation,|but what about the museum?
{35633}{35669}I'm going to do this in layers.
{35672}{35729}You'll be allowed in your offices|once we've been through the building
{35732}{35769}and determined|that there is no danger.
{35772}{35828}But what about our exhibition space?|When will that open?
{35831}{35897}We have a major exhibit|about to open.
{35900}{35980}The board is hosting a gala preview|here tomorrow night.
{35983}{36043}It's so vital to us.
{36049}{36091}I can't tell you exactly when.
{36094}{36164}Lieutenant,|we've invested so much in this.
{36167}{36243}It would be a disaster for us|if we had to postpone.
{36246}{36338}We're checking your offices and labs first|so you people can go back, do your work.
{36341}{36423}It won't take long. Now,|as far as the areas open to the public,
{36426}{36452}we may have somebody|on our hands
{36455}{36515}who makes Jeffery Dahmer|look like a Cub Scout,
{36518}{36596}and I've got to be sure|he's not here.
{36994}{37101}Dr. Green.|I'd like to ask you a few questions.
{37118}{37161}Okay.
{37193}{37261}- What's that stuff you were looking at?|- DNA strands.
{37264}{37321}Did you come all the way down here|to learn about DNA?
{37324}{37355}No.
{37358}{37423}I hope you don't mind walking.|I have to return these samples.
{37426}{37477}Well, if I get tired,|I'll let you know.
{37480}{37566}- What's the soup today?|- Rhinoceros megarhinus.
{37569}{37630}He's making rhinoceros soup?
{37633}{37714}It's a maceration tank.|Skin them, toss them in the warm water,
{37717}{37782}wait until the meat and flesh fall off,|and then give them to the beetles.
{37785}{37833}Beetles as in bug beetles?
{37845}{37900}Domestic beetles are|a fairly common insect.
{37903}{37974}They eat the flesh off almost anything.|They pick the bones clean.
{37977}{38034}Better watch yourself.|Someone left the glass case open last night
{38037}{38061}and a bunch hit the highway.
{38064}{38107}Well, they know better|than to head for the cafeteria.
{38110}{38208}I'm sorry you had to see all that|at the crime scene.
{38212}{38278}I said hello to that man every day|for the past six years.
{38281}{38349}You could have closed the door.
{38352}{38418}- Did you know him well?|- No.
{38459}{38501}Wait.
{38508}{38580}- Is it face up?|- Down.
{38583}{38634}Don't touch it.|Face down's bad luck.
{38637}{38704}Don't tell me|you're superstitious.
{38707}{38792}Sorry, but around here,|every penny counts.
{38821}{38851}What the hell's all this?
{38854}{38920}This is one of six storage areas|for the collection.
{38923}{39006}The museum has something|like 3 million specimens.
{39009}{39083}Exhibition areas only show about 2%|of what the museum owns.
{39086}{39154}It doesn't look like a good place|to light a match.
{39157}{39257}According to museum security,|you were the last one to leave last night.
{39260}{39361}- Did you see or hear anything strange?|- No.
{39364}{39407}Well, I thought I heard something|as I was leaving,
{39410}{39473}but it could have been anything.|I was tired.
{39476}{39535}What can you tell me about John Whitney?|You know him?
{39538}{39643}- Unfortunately.|- His office was vandalized last night.
{39680}{39720}Sir.
{39783}{39819}Do you have any idea|what might have been in this office
{39822}{39858}that someone would want|so damn bad?
{39861}{39931}I have no idea why anyone would want|anything of John Whitney's.
{39934}{39986}But I've been told|mine's a subjective opinion.
{39989}{40056}You ever see John Whitney with Fred Ford?|Were they friends?
{40059}{40099}No.
{40104}{40203}- Does John Whitney use or sell drugs?|- I don't think so.
{40206}{40324}John Whitney's not in Brazil|shipping drugs, just insignificant relics.
{40337}{40408}- Brazil?|- Yeah, a couple of crates came in yesterday.
{40411}{40451}- What was in them?|- One had a smashed relic.
{40454}{40488}The other was empty.
{40491}{40550}- So there was nothing inside?|- That's what empty means.
{40553}{40605}- Could it have been pried open?|- It was nailed shut.
{40608}{40646}Could it have been pried open|and then nailed shut?
{40649}{40722}I suppose so. What are you suggesting?|That there were drugs in the crate?
{40725}{40799}I don't suggest.|Where are those crates?
{40802}{40897}They were burned, but the relic's|in the restoration department.
{40997}{41070}Perri Masai, our restorative genius,|Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{41073}{41095}Hi.
{41098}{41184}Well, this is John Whitney's relic|or what's left of it.
{41187}{41255}- Any idea what it looks like?|- With black stone, it's difficult.
{41258}{41302}It's a chimera of some kind.
{41305}{41369}- What's a chimera?|- It's a combination of creatures
{41372}{41468}that superstitious people|see as god or enemy.
{41473}{41544}What kind of superstitious people?
{41618}{41678}Here's my card.|If you think of anything else...
{41681}{41733}You're welcome.
{41837}{41892}Lieutenant D'Agosta,
{41895}{42014}it's lovely to see you|under such alarming circumstances.
{42018}{42097}Seven decapitations in one week.
{42100}{42175}Don't you just hate someone|who only takes head and never gives it?
{42178}{42220}You're bad, Matilda, real bad.
{42223}{42326}Autopsy attended by Lieutenant Vincent|D'Agosta, Chicago homicide.
{42329}{42422}- I heard your ex got custody of the dog.|- What, it's on the goddamn Internet?
{42425}{42520}You shouldn't have been late|on your Alpo payments.
{42543}{42645}We have an African American male,|probably age 55 to 60.
{42648}{42740}Height, 5'4",|with his head, maybe 6'1".
{42743}{42838}Weight, 160, give or take,|if you know what I mean.
{42841}{42894}There are an undetermined|number of lacerations
{42897}{42987}preceding from the left anterior pectoral|region downward through the sternum,
{42990}{43066}terminating at the right|anterior abdominal region.
{43069}{43157}The pectoralis minor and pectoralis major|are separated to a great degree.
{43160}{43202}And there is|spontaneous dehiscence.
{43205}{43308}The sternal process has been split|and the rib cage exposed.
{43311}{43398}Now for the head.|The head is decapitated
{43401}{43468}between the axial process|and the atlas.
{43471}{43554}The entire occipital portion|of the calvarium
{43557}{43615}and half the parietal process|has been crushed
{43618}{43700}or rather seemingly punched through|and removed,
{43703}{43786}leaving a hole perhaps|5 inches in diameter.
{43789}{43884}The skull is empty.|The entire brain appears to have fallen out
{43887}{43950}or been extracted|through this hole.
{43953}{44056}- Any idea about a weapon?|- Something big.
{44089}{44133}The brain is severely traumatized
{44136}{44208}and appears to have been severed|at the medulla oblongata.
{44211}{44262}The pons Varolii|is intact but separate.
{44265}{44352}The cerebrum has been completely severed|from the mesencephalon.
{44355}{44497}And... Wait a minute,|this brain's light, even for a man.
{44508}{44578}Something's missing, Lieutenant.|Where's the rest of it?
{44581}{44682}- You got everything we found.|- There is no thalamic region.
{44685}{44779}- There is no pituitary gland.|- What are you talking about?
{44782}{44892}The thalamus and hypothalamus|regulate body temperature, blood pressure,
{44895}{45002}heartbeat, it regulates hundreds|of hormones into the bloodstream.
{45005}{45070}- Don't you agree, Fred?|- Yes.
{45073}{45128}He never shuts up.
{45589}{45636}That was fast.
{45755}{45860}Glycotetraline collagenoid,|Weinstein's thyrotropic hormone.
{45863}{46001}Tenascin, oxytocin, monoxytocin,|suppressive hormones.
{46004}{46091}This fungus is loaded with hormones,|animal hormones.
{46094}{46157}What kind of fungus is this?
{46473}{46550}Hollingsworth, I hope|I'm interrupting your dinner.
{46553}{46646}Listen, dig up whatever records|we have on those bodies from the ship.
{46649}{46678}If there were any autopsies done,
{46681}{46767}check and see if any part of the brain|was missing from any of the heads.
{46770}{46882}I don't care how long it takes.|Let me ask you something.
{46896}{46976}How the fuck does somebody|get custody of a dog?
{47079}{47131}- Good night.|- Good night, ma'am.
{52755}{52852}- Morning, Lieutenant.|- Pretty fancy.
{52855}{52934}It only took|seven months planning.
{52937}{53015}I really hope|you can have your party tonight.
{53018}{53058}So do I.
{53061}{53126}We may have a majorly crazy person|somewhere in this building
{53129}{53194}and I don't think you'd want him|showing up tonight.
{53197}{53259}No, we can't have that.
{53302}{53378}- This is a big deal, isn't it?|- Very big.
{53381}{53482}- This party will raise a lot of money, right?|- A lot of money. Very high profile.
{53485}{53570}The Mayor is coming, the media,|big companies that give lots of grants,
{53573}{53652}- limousines, the whole schmeer.|- Tell you what, we'll find this guy
{53655}{53691}so you can have your party.
{53694}{53795}Lieutenant, do you like smoked salmon|on those little round toasty things?
{53798}{53871}- I don't think I've ever had it.|- Well, if you don't catch your man,
{53874}{53960}there's going to be|about 300 pounds of it.
{54141}{54212}Yeah, but have you tried|the lattes with the whole milk?
{54215}{54313}- Very smooth.|- I like espresso. Forget smooth.
{54316}{54378}- What the fuck do you know?|- I know I like espresso.
{54381}{54455}- Yeah, but have you tried lattes?|- No.
{54458}{54545}There's supposed to be a door|around here someplace.
{54607}{54668}Here it is. Here it is.
{54766}{54809}Jesus.
{54940}{55031}Come out, come out,|wherever you are.
{55044}{55119}I don't know|where the hell we are.
{55136}{55224}Maybe I'm reading this map wrong,|I don't know.
{55244}{55296}Look at this!
{55310}{55338}Jesus.
{55341}{55387}Is that a footprint?
{55475}{55576}- He's got to be over 7 feet tall.|- Looks like blood.
{55600}{55657}I think it is blood.
{55913}{55985}Good morning, Lieutenant.|How are you today?
{55988}{56060}- What have you got?|- Right.
{56085}{56206}- Well, we checked on that hypo...|- Hypothalamus.
{56209}{56309}Right. Anyway,|what heads we were able
{56312}{56407}to salvage from the Santos Morales|were pretty decomposed.
{56412}{56531}But they were all missing|their hypothalamuses.
{56569}{56637}Why thank you, Hollingsworth.
{57405}{57483}It's the consistent repetition|of sequences of three
{57486}{57583}that are unique to each individual.|But before you begin DNA testing,
{57586}{57647}you have to be able|to identify the specimen.
{57650}{57702}With your financial grant,
{57705}{57814}the complicated, tedious task|of specimen identification
{57817}{57928}will become a quick,|certain, analytical technique.
{57985}{58097}Procedure. Mode? System.
{58127}{58208}Just give me the goddamn money.|Shit.
{58289}{58358}One of the kids i n your lab told me|where to find you.
{58375}{58460}Well, I was just rehearsing.
{58463}{58544}- You were really good.|- Yeah. Right.
{58598}{58656}Really good ending.
{58668}{58719}Hold on.
{58744}{58860}- So, what's your field exactly? Biology?|- Evolutionary biology.
{58863}{58940}- Are we still evolving?|- Some of us.
{58944}{59036}Look, Lieutenant, I'm really busy right now,|and I don't have time to be socializing,
{59039}{59122}- so if you don't mind.|- I'm not here to ask you out, Dr. Green.
{59125}{59151}I just thought|there might be something else
{59154}{59239}you could tell me|about John Whitney's work.
{59263}{59318}Well, I'll take you to|Dr. Frock, our curator.
{59321}{59399}He could probably explain John Whitney|better than I can.
{59429}{59517}- It's Margo.|- Who have you brought me?
{59520}{59558}A policeman. Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{59561}{59683}Well, how goes the gradual extinction|of the human race, Lieutenant?
{59686}{59752}I'm doing what I can|to keep it orderly.
{59755}{59842}You and the lieutenant are kindred spirits.|He's very superstitious.
{59845}{59929}- I don't know about "very".|- Well, you must excuse Margo, Lieutenant.
{59932}{59994}She believes that science|must destroy myth,
{59997}{60109}and as a consequence, she has very little|patience with superstitious people like us.
{60112}{60183}Margo, did I ever tell you|about my experiences
{60186}{60235}with the Khoe tribe|in Botswana land?
{60238}{60320}- Yes, more than once.|- Haven't told him.
{60330}{60462}The Khoe tribe, Lieutenant, believed|that headaches were caused by sorcery
{60468}{60566}and the pin poke of the headache victim|would identify the sorcerer,
{60569}{60612}and then go off and murder him.
{60615}{60724}Of course, the kinfolk of the sorcerer|would feel they had to avenge his death,
{60727}{60781}so they'd go and in turn|kill the headache victim.
{60784}{60858}And I'm sure you can imagine|how it eventually all turned out.
{60861}{60908}- What's that?|- Well, it's a medical miracle.
{60911}{60987}Everybody stopped having headaches.
{61001}{61054}Lieutenant, what would|a superstitious police officer
{61057}{61110}possibly want|with an old fossil like me?
{61113}{61175}- He wants to know about John Whitney.|- You think there's some connection
{61178}{61242}between the vandalism|in John's office and the murder?
{61245}{61305}Maybe. What's John Whitney|doing in Brazil?
{61308}{61390}Well, John's an anthropologist.|He's in Brazil studying ancient tribes,
{61393}{61476}their rituals, their environmental|and social relations, their culture.
{61479}{61520}When was the last time|you heard from him?
{61523}{61574}I haven't had actual contact with him|for months,
{61577}{61645}but just yesterday,|we received a wonderful artifact.
{61648}{61705}Yeah. I took a look at it.
{61708}{61753}That artifact's rather important|to me, Lieutenant,
{61756}{61824}because it may help to illuminate|a scientific theory
{61827}{61874}I've been expounding|for some time.
{61877}{61930}- The Callisto Effect.|- What's that?
{61933}{62054}It's a commonly-held belief that life evolved|gradually by natural selection.
{62057}{62146}Dr. Frock argues that sometimes|there are sudden evolutionary changes
{62149}{62261}that create a grotesque|and short-lived aberrant species.
{62264}{62374}Okay, so, John Whitney's down in Brazil|studying ancient tribal rituals.
{62377}{62458}Could any of these rituals|have anything to do with, say,
{62461}{62526}ripping out|the human hypothalamus?
{62529}{62617}- I beg your pardon?|- Human hypothalamus?
{62713}{62754}Never mind.
{62791}{62832}You smell that?
{62835}{62927}It's that same stink|from where they found that guard.
{62930}{62981}Better get some backup down here.
{62984}{63046}2-4, 2-4, this is 2-6, you copy?
{63049}{63110}Shit!|We're under too much concrete.
{63132}{63192}What the fuck was that?
{63195}{63284}- Was that in front of us?|- It's hard to tell.
{64352}{64446}The guy was a convicted rapist.|He's a suspect in a couple of murders,
{64449}{64480}two terms of hard time,
{64483}{64538}and he fits the description|given to us by the two boys.
{64541}{64594}Those kids didn't see him|commit the murder.
{64597}{64650}Lieutenant, come on.|This place, it could've been anything.
{64653}{64698}He attacked McNally|with a fucking ax.
{64701}{64747}You know, you wanna take|somebody's head off,
{64750}{64845}- an ax is a pretty good way to do it.|- I know. I know, I know, I know, I know.
{64848}{64922}- So what's the matter?|- Something's not right.
{64925}{64956}- What's not right?|- Something.
{64959}{64991}Something what?
{64994}{65038}You're a pain in the ass,|you know that?
{65041}{65112}Here comes the rent-a-cop.
{65249}{65336}Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
{65364}{65430}- Can I get a little help here?|- Congratulations, Lieutenant.
{65433}{65495}- Looks like you've got your man.|- Maybe.
{65498}{65542}- Maybe?|- Maybe.
{65545}{65636}The man was covered in the dead guard's|blood. He was carrying his wallet.
{65639}{65697}He tried to cut his head off|with an ax.
{65700}{65775}- What do you need? A videotape?|- That'd help.
{65778}{65846}- This is nuts.|- Something's wrong.
{65849}{65894}We got a homeless ex-con|who gets his jollies
{65897}{65942}from ripping out|people's hypothalamuses?
{65945}{66002}What's he doing?|Starting a hypothalamus collection?
{66005}{66087}This guy gets on a boat sailing from Brazil,|he kills everyone onboard,
{66090}{66130}then he catches a cab|to the museum,
{66133}{66175}where he hides in the closet|in the sub-basement.
{66178}{66258}I don't know anything|about boats from Brazil,
{66261}{66331}but it's obvious to me|that this man killed Frederick Ford.
{66334}{66428}Two plus two, Lieutenant,|in my book, that's four.
{66431}{66480}You have to|let the gala go on tonight.
{66483}{66565}I don't have to|let anything go on tonight.
{66672}{66709}Asshole.
{66712}{66780}- Lieutenant.|- What's this?
{66783}{66855}We found this|under the guy's bed.
{66865}{66936}Jaime Martinez.
{66939}{67040}He was one of the victims|on the Santos Morales.
{67045}{67105}- Shit.|- This has got to be our guy.
{67108}{67208}- Lieutenant, it's for you.|- Who is it?
{67360}{67414}- Hello?|- This is Mayor Owen.
{67417}{67458}What's your first name, Lieutenant?
{67461}{67497}- Vincent.|- May I call you Vincent?
{67500}{67523}- Sure.|- Good.
{67526}{67558}You can call me Your Honor.
{67561}{67629}Tell you what, Vincent.|Looking forward to this gala tonight.
{67632}{67714}My wife is, too. She bought a killer dress|that shows off her cleavage.
{67717}{67772}Have you ever seen my wife's cleavage?|It's in all the papers.
{67775}{67809}I can't say that I have,|Your Honor.
{67812}{67890}Well, you're one of the few people|in the city of Chicago who hasn't.
{67893}{67937}That cleavage helped get me elected.
{67943}{67977}I'll bet you don't know what to say.
{67980}{68004}No, sir, I don't.
{68007}{68069}So the thing is, Vincent,|this gala tonight is very important.
{68072}{68126}It's important to the museum,|it's important to my wife,
{68129}{68258}it's important to the city, and it's real|important to Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.
{68261}{68292}- You know who they are?|- No.
{68295}{68360}Well, they're good friends of mine,|real good friends.
{68363}{68403}They're good friends of the city.
{68406}{68433}Real good friends.
{68436}{68499}I was so upset when I thought|they would be disappointed tonight
{68502}{68571}until I heard the wonderful news|that you caught that murderer.
{68574}{68675}Terrible business. Anyway, I called|to congratulate you on a job well done.
{68678}{68730}I'm so happy we'll be having|that gala tonight.
{68733}{68782}I'm gonna call the chief and tell him|just how happy I am.
{68785}{68824}Nice talking to you, Vincent.
{69000}{69072}I'm going to clear the wings|of museum personnel
{69075}{69158}and open only the|central exhibition area.
{69161}{69238}And I'm going to maintain|police presence throughout.
{69241}{69300}How much police presence?
{69309}{69400}As much as I goddamn|deem necessary.
{69488}{69519}- Tell Bert...|- What?
{69522}{69582}I want to make a final sweep|while the wings are still closed.
{69585}{69619}Get me a team of dogs.
{69622}{69710}But we already swept with dogs, Lieutenant,|right after we found the body.
{69713}{69791}So get better dogs. I'll take them down|myself, and you're coming with me.
{71443}{71548}Dermestes vulpinus.|That's the dermestid beetle.
{71562}{71680}Match with 33%|Hemidactylus turcicus.
{71696}{71790}Hemidactylus turcicus?|What the hell is that?
{71793}{71826}Have you seen Greg?
{71829}{71878}- He's down there.|- Thanks.
{71881}{71976}Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.|How wonderful you look this evening.
{71979}{72037}I'm Greg Lee.
{72048}{72166}I'm Greg Lee, Mr. Blaisedale.|How rich you look this evening.
{72169}{72253}Good evening, Mr. Blaisedale.|I didn't know you have a daughter.
{72256}{72317}Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt|your little meeting.
{72320}{72379}- You not going to the party?|- I'm going.
{72382}{72446}Don't get your|greedy little hopes up.
{72449}{72499}Can you identify these species?
{72502}{72537}Now you want my help?
{72540}{72616}Look, can you|identify them or not?
{72664}{72743}Hemidactylus turcicus.|That's a Turkish gecko.
{72746}{72778}- Gecko?|- Yeah, a lizard.
{72781}{72833}Yes, I know what a gecko is.
{72836}{72902}But reptilian and beetle DNA|on the same strand?
{72905}{72938}Well, maybe your source|is contaminated.
{72941}{72994}It's not contaminated.|I scraped the cells myself.
{72997}{73028}Then it's your software.
{73031}{73161}Of course, I'd be shocked to think|that it may not be 100% accurate.
{73164}{73216}You can get back|to the Blaisedales now.
{73781}{73887}Well, it looks to me as if we're just about|as ready as we're going to be.
{74179}{74231}You know, they're|closing down the wing soon.
{74234}{74332}- I wouldn't want you to miss the party.|- I'll be there.
{74834}{74889}We'll head down to the basement|to our storage level here
{74892}{74928}and work our way east to west.
{74931}{74996}- Make sense to you?|- Yeah, I think it'll work.
{74999}{75055}You got something for the dogs?
{75155}{75244}Pollux. Castor.
{75439}{75484}Hello.
{76003}{76051}Hello.
{76134}{76228}- Margo, are you here?|- I'm at the electron microscope.
{76231}{76302}Come on, girl. It's party time.
{76319}{76379}Wait. You're not even dressed yet.
{76382}{76416}I need you to take a look at this.
{76419}{76490}I'm not gonna take a look at anything|until you get dressed.
{76493}{76573}That parasite Greg Lee is gonna steal|your grant right out from under you
{76576}{76659}- unless you get in there and start pitching.|- All right. All right.
{76662}{76738}Try and guess what that is.
{76872}{76935}I don't think I've ever seen|anything quite like this before.
{76938}{77010}- It's a dermestid beetle.|- Dermestid? Are you sure?
{77013}{77071}Remember the leaves from|Whitney's crate? - Yeah.
{77074}{77107}That beetle ate part of one.
{77110}{77198}I ran some cells through the interpolator|searching for a match.
{77201}{77252}It came back|"dermestid beetle".
{77255}{77392}But the analysis also revealed|a large percentage of reptilian DNA.
{77414}{77478}Reptilian? Well, there|must be some mistake, Margo.
{77481}{77555}- I ran it through three times.|- There must be something in the leaf.
{77558}{77612}Take a look at that printout.
{77626}{77666}Hormones. Lots of them.
{77669}{77840}Gammaglobulin AXY,|left positive, reverse transcriptase.
{77851}{77942}That's an enzyme almost always found|in association with viruses.
{77945}{78005}This plant is heavily|infected with a virus.
{78008}{78058}So it's taken over|some of the plant cells
{78061}{78154}and inserted its own genetic material|into the plant's genes.
{78157}{78251}But why would a virus|code for animal proteins?
{78617}{78650}Mr. Mayor.
{78653}{78695}Your Honor,|how do you feel about the exhibit?
{78698}{78746}- Very, very proud.|- Are you superstitious?
{78749}{78810}Only around election time.
{78813}{78850}Let's go, Castor.|Come on, Pollux.
{78853}{78918}Come on, boy. Come on.
{78921}{78962}- Anything?|- No, nothing yet.
{78965}{79048}There's a lot of foreign smells down here,|which might knock off their olfactors.
{79051}{79136}We'll have to take it slow.|Come on, boy. Attaboy!
{79889}{79963}- Looking very dapper tonight.|- You think so?
{79966}{80022}'Cause I don't see too many other guys|wearing these ruffles.
{80025}{80073}You look cool.
{80109}{80174}Your Honor, so pleased to see you.
{80177}{80210}So excited about being here.
{80213}{80289}What you got? What you got? That's right.|Come on. What you got? What you got?
{80292}{80352}What you got? What you got?
{80356}{80417}We know these hormones|are responsible for growth,
{80420}{80506}bone structure, exoskeletal physiology|and skin maintenance.
{80509}{80578}A huge influx of these|could easily cause it to change.
{80581}{80605}Of course it could.
{80608}{80662}Do you think Whitney knew|about the properties of these leaves
{80665}{80689}before he sent them?
{80692}{80749}Maybe he wasn't just using them|as packing material.
{80752}{80801}Maybe there was nothing missing|from the crate.
{80804}{80912}Maybe the leaves were the shipment.|But why? I don't get it.
{80915}{80954}Margo.
{80960}{81022}The hormones listed|in this analysis of the leaf,
{81025}{81096}they're all produced|by the human hypothalamus.
{81099}{81159}Of course, it's a much more|concentrated form here,
{81162}{81254}and one milligram of this material|is equal to more than 100 milligrams
{81257}{81292}of the hormone produced|by the hypothalamus.
{81295}{81340}Wait, wait.|Remember when the Lieutenant
{81343}{81388}said something|about the human hypothalamus?
{81391}{81493}Yeah. - Do you think this is somehow|connected to Fred Ford's murder?
{81496}{81640}Well, if it is, whoever killed Fred Ford|really needs the hormones on that leaf.
{81643}{81694}We better find|Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{81771}{81843}Where the hell is Margo?
{81914}{81977}He's absolutely correct.
{82052}{82130}Harriet, George, I'm so|pleased to see you. - Hello.
{82133}{82187}- This is wonderful. Wonderful.|- Thank you.
{82190}{82241}Come with me. I have someone|I want to introduce you to.
{82244}{82274}Thank you.
{82277}{82359}Michael, Candice,|I want you to meet the Blaisedales.
{82362}{82408}- Harriet and George.|- Hello.
{82411}{82468}Come on. What've we got?
{82501}{82542}Detective!
{82686}{82779}- Run. Find, find!|- I've got you.
{82951}{83076}Johnson, Parkinson here. It's time to|shut down the outer cells. Do you read?
{83079}{83149}Right, sir.|Still checking the lab area.
{83152}{83205}Lab area? Everyone was|supposed to be out by 6:00.
{83208}{83272}I just came from the lab, Mr. Parkinson.|I was the last one out.
{83275}{83339}You sure? It could be a long night|for anyone locked in down there.
{83342}{83399}It's completely deserted.
{83417}{83485}It's clear. Shut it down.
{83527}{83579}Shutting down.
{83877}{83918}Done.
{83969}{84069}If he's not upstairs, one of the other officers|will probably know how to find him.
{84072}{84140}- It's locked.|- Well, it seems that that imbecile Parkinson
{84143}{84222}made good on his promise.|He sealed off the entire wing.
{84225}{84261}- Come on, Professor.|- Where?
{84264}{84311}Down the fire stairs|and across the sub-basement.
{84314}{84380}- Down the stairs?|- I hope your brakes work.
{84462}{84530}- Champagne. How lovely.|- Yes.
{84533}{84615}- Thank you very much, Mister...|- Lee. Greg Lee.
{84618}{84717}And may I say how enchanting you look|this evening, Mrs. Blaisedale.
{84720}{84801}- We've gone off the map, Evans.|- This is the old coal tunnel.
{84804}{84830}- Lieutenant.|- Yeah?
{84833}{84902}- The scent seems to be getting stronger.|- What the hell is this?
{84905}{84973}Electric trams hauled coal right into|the basement from the old barges.
{84976}{85038}- That's how Chicago stayed warm.|- How far does it go?
{85041}{85074}This one goes|all the way to Lake Michigan.
{85077}{85137}At least that's what they say.|No one really comes down here.
{85140}{85172}Let me ask you something.
{85175}{85227}Could somebody get off a ship|docked at the lake
{85230}{85263}and go through these tunnels
{85266}{85323}all the way to the museum|without being seen?
{85326}{85378}- Sure.|- We're moving now, guys.
{85381}{85423}Let's go.
{85768}{85837}- What in god's name is that smell?|- I don't like this.
{85840}{85865}Okay, we can do this.
{85868}{85914}Bradley and I go together.|Evans, you're behind me.
{85917}{86010}Hollingsworth, stay here. If I call you,|get that cannon up there. Let's go.
{86065}{86112}Come on, Castor.
{86299}{86359}There's something moving|right in front of us!
{86362}{86456}Castor, Pollux, heel! Heel!
{86553}{86614}Hollingsworth! Hollingsworth!
{86713}{86756}You okay?
{86821}{86892}Castor? Pollux?
{87031}{87081}Holy shit!
{87261}{87326}Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!|What the hell did this?
{87329}{87376}Castor?
{87382}{87458}- Oh, dear god! Pollux!|- Bradley, no!
{87461}{87514}- Pollux!|- Bradley!
{87517}{87547}Pollux!
{87550}{87583}Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth!
{87586}{87619}Take Evans|and get your ass upstairs.
{87622}{87674}Find Cuthbert, Parkinson,|whoever the hell's in charge,
{87677}{87758}and clear out the museum.|Go! Now!
{87774}{87816}Bradley!
{87843}{87888}Bradley!
{87986}{88028}Bradley!
{88199}{88246}- Are you lost, Margo?|- Of course I'm lost.
{88249}{88296}Just checking.
{88454}{88494}Pollux!
{88514}{88557}Pollux!
{88564}{88605}Pollux!
{88631}{88670}Pollux!
{88684}{88723}Pollux!
{88765}{88850}Come on, boy.|Come on. Let's go.
{88877}{88945}Come on.|What's the matter with you?
{89677}{89795}Ladies and gentlemen, welcome|and thank you very much for being here.
{89798}{89905}I'd like to introduce to you|one of this museum's best friends
{89908}{89964}and staunchest supporters,
{89967}{90067}the mayor of our city,|the Honorable Robert Owen.
{90103}{90178}Thank you, Dr. Cuthbert.|Ladies and gentlemen,
{90181}{90317}I am so excited and honored to be here|at this wonderful museum this evening.
{90321}{90373}As we march forward
{90376}{90450}with fragile footsteps into the sunset|of the last few years...
{90453}{90520}- Is he speaking English?|- I don't know.
{90527}{90604}Bradley! Bradley!
{92181}{92300}Here, boy. You scared me.|You scared me.
{92843}{92936}- This coffee's terrible.|- It's bitter. Very bitter.
{93001}{93066}- What do you think, darling?|- The telling moment.
{93069}{93110}Not for me. Not today.
{93218}{93271}...the beginning of|superstition, really...
{93274}{93370}- Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.|- ...in Egypt very early about 50,000 B.C.
{93417}{93500}But here's the "piece de résistance".
{93503}{93664}This is a very rare sacrificial palette|from Mesoamerica.
{93682}{93758}- The priests would sacrifice their victims...|- Excuse me. Excuse me.
{93761}{93828}- ...by cutting out the beating heart.|- Excuse me.
{93831}{93936}- That's pleasant. Then what?|- Well, then they would eat it.
{93939}{94025}You know, I think I could use|one of these things down at City Hall.
{94028}{94080}Shall we?
{94201}{94300}Primordial forest. There's Pan.
{94389}{94528}And here we are in Brazil.|We're with the spirits of the Amazon now.
{94539}{94638}And here is the great devil god,
{94641}{94749}the Kothoga, sitting on the|skulls of his dead victims.
{94752}{94809}- Look out.|- Out of the way.
{94832}{94880}Look at this.
{94994}{95062}You know, I wonder what...
{95104}{95173}What the...|What in the hell...
{95193}{95221}Come on. Come on.
{95224}{95262}- Dr. Cuthbert.|- Wait.
{95265}{95307}- Oh, god.|- Mr. Mayor!
{95337}{95414}Excuse me!|May I ask what you think you're doing?
{95417}{95463}My name's Hollingsworth,|Chicago homicide.
{95466}{95529}We have to get everybody|out of here now.
{95551}{95612}We got a very dangerous situation,|Your Honor.
{95978}{96018}What the hell...
{96081}{96124}Come on. Let's go!
{96197}{96225}Holy shit, look at this.
{96228}{96292}We got a robbery alert|in the new exhibition space.
{96369}{96444}- What the hell is going on?|- I have no idea, but I'll find out.
{96447}{96523}- Keep moving.|- Come on, let's go.
{96543}{96624}Five, six, seven.|The whole board's going down.
{96734}{96818}Code 27.|It says we're having an earthquake!
{96871}{96956}This is Chicago.|We don't have earthquakes in Chicago.
{96959}{97039}Johnson, Wootton,|we've got problems up here!
{97107}{97188}The computer's forcing down|the last cell doors.
{97242}{97301}Jesus! This diorama wall,|can't we override manually?
{97304}{97334}Not in code status, I can't.
{97337}{97375}We're gonna have to reset|the whole system.
{97378}{97444}That's impossible.|Somebody's fucking with us.
{97865}{97954}Shit. We're shut down.|Everything is shut down.
{100313}{100402}Wootton, Johnson, what the hell's going on|up there? The fire doors are down.
{100405}{100462}- Shit!|- Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.
{100465}{100511}Where the hell are you?
{100525}{100569}Phones are out.
{100572}{100639}And all the power's out|all over the museum.
{100642}{100706}Well, what about the|emergency generator?
{100709}{100826}It's only for the lab area to keep their|computer systems and refrigerators going.
{100829}{100919}It's over in the east wing.|It's about a mile from here.
{100948}{100998}What about the backup batteries|for the security system?
{101001}{101070}Maybe we can reboot,|then get it back online.
{101073}{101144}It's over in the|power room somewheres.
{101151}{101192}I'll go.
{101224}{101298}Excuse me, sir. May I ask you|a few questions? Can I ask you a few...
{101301}{101388}Don't lock the door.|I hate when you do that.
{102107}{102162}What the hell did that?
{102165}{102266}Control, this is Parkinson.|What the hell is going on down there?
{102269}{102325}Would you answer me,|for Christ's sakes?
{102328}{102387}Someone fucking trashed|the backup system.
{102390}{102448}Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.|Where the hell are you?
{102451}{102529}Hey, asshole.|Aren't you gonna answer the man?
{102737}{102784}I can't reach the|damn control room.
{102787}{102853}All right. McNally, help me get a count.|Let's figure a way out of here.
{102856}{102948}We can't lift the fire door|until we get the computer restarted.
{102951}{103011}The fire stairs|only lead to the basement.
{103014}{103051}Then maybe that's what we'll do.
{103054}{103142}Heel. Heel. What is it?
{103161}{103196}What is it?
{103199}{103225}This is absurd.
{103228}{103310}Every police officer in the city of Chicago|is gonna be on the other side of that door
{103313}{103408}in five minutes trying to figure out a way|to get through. We wait here.
{104350}{104395}You ready?
{104499}{104562}I don't think you understand|how this works.
{104565}{104645}You're a junior detective.|You don't order the Mayor to do anything.
{104648}{104714}All I know is I've been ordered to get|everybody out of this building.
{104717}{104811}Now someone or something is in here.|You saw what it can do.
{104817}{104909}- Sorry, but I'm not budging.|- Is anybody there?
{104918}{105000}- Wootton?|- No, D'Agosta. Put the Mayor on.
{105029}{105087}Put him on!
{105090}{105145}It's for you, Your Honor.
{105201}{105250}- Put this over your head.|- This is Mayor Owen.
{105253}{105294}Mayor Owen,|this is Lieutenant D'Agosta.
{105297}{105362}- Lieutenant D'Augusta.|- D'Agosta, sir.
{105365}{105449}Vincent. Badge number 14173.|We spoke once before.
{105452}{105518}- Do you remember?|- I want you to consider very carefully...
{105521}{105582}With all due respect, sir,|you can fire me on Monday.
{105585}{105654}But right now, I want you|to shut your fucking mouth and listen.
{105657}{105711}I'm putting|Sergeant Hollingsworth in charge,
{105714}{105784}and you're going to do exactly|what he tells you to do.
{105787}{105833}- Or what, Lieutenant?|- Or none of you
{105836}{105885}are gonna live to see election day.
{105888}{105914}Hollingsworth.
{105917}{105992}- Hollingsworth, are you there?|- Excuse me, Your Honor.
{105995}{106048}- I'm here, Lieutenant.|- Take the fire stairs back down
{106051}{106129}to the sub-basement|and head west into the service area.
{106132}{106207}Go through the passageway|for the old coal line.
{106210}{106259}You'll come up across the street|from the museum.
{106262}{106352}Now you go slow. You go quiet.|You stick together.
{106355}{106412}- You understand?|- I got it.
{106445}{106502}I'm not walking through some|filthy crawl space...
{106505}{106556}Shut up, Tom!
{106589}{106660}- Let's go.|- Let's move.
{106733}{106813}Excuse me, but I don't care|what the Lieutenant,
{106816}{106882}whatever the hell his name is, says.|I'm staying!
{106885}{106944}I'm afraid my wife and I|will be staying, as well.
{106947}{106999}Mr. Blaisedale,|we must stay together.
{107002}{107073}But she won't physically be able to go|downstairs or through tunnels.
{107076}{107107}It's best if we stay behind.
{107110}{107167}- One of us can carry her.|- It's out of the question.
{107170}{107204}We'll be fine here.
{107207}{107293}Okay, officer, I'll stay behind|and protect Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.
{107296}{107328}Give me a break!
{107331}{107383}We're not going.|What are you gonna do?
{107386}{107450}- Shoot us?|- All right. All right.
{107454}{107508}One of you stay here with them.|Now who's it gonna be?
{107511}{107557}- I'll stay.|- I'll stay.
{107563}{107620}McNally, you're staying.
{107644}{107728}- You got plenty of ammo?|- I'm loaded.
{107741}{107812}Okay, let's move.
{107815}{107870}Dr. Cuthbert. Dr. Cuthbert.
{107873}{107918}I'm sorry, but I don't think|you should do this.
{107921}{108000}Bullshit, Tom. You're fired.
{108088}{108174}I'll lead with the shotgun.|Bailey, you stay at the back.
{108177}{108246}The rest are single file.|Now, it's gonna be dark.
{108249}{108349}We go slow, we go quiet|and we stick together.
{108381}{108414}- Inside.|- Thank you.
{108417}{108450}- I got you.|- You all right?
{108453}{108532}Come on. - All right,|stay close and watch your step.
{108606}{108663}Let's keep it going.|Keep it going.
{108666}{108721}Can I get you a drink?
{108895}{108952}What is it, boy?
{109008}{109050}Let's go.
{109371}{109418}Oh, god, Lieutenant D'Agosta!|We've been trying to find you!
{109421}{109480}You got to get out of here.
{109517}{109568}Oh, my god! No!
{109827}{109880}Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
{110396}{110458}Somebody want to tell me|what in god's name that was?
{110461}{110507}I think it's the Kothoga.
{110510}{110553}John Whitney must have found it|somewhere, somehow
{110556}{110594}and sent it back to the museum.
{110597}{110658}But, for god's sake,|why wouldn't he give us warning?
{110661}{110719}How big were those crates|that John Whitney sent back?
{110722}{110747}Not very big.
{110750}{110803}How the hell does something like that|fit inside one of them?
{110806}{110915}In those crates that Whitney sent back,|the artifact was packed in a leaf specimen
{110918}{111025}that carried a parasitic fungus.|The fungus was loaded with hormones,
{111028}{111135}animal hormones that are produced|in the thalamoid region of the human brain.
{111138}{111218}- You mean the hypothalamus.|- I know this is crazy,
{111221}{111298}but maybe this animal started out|as something else,
{111301}{111397}a chameleon, a lizard,|maybe even a dog.
{111400}{111504}It ate those leaves, and it changed|into whatever it is now.
{111550}{111600}Into what we just saw.
{111649}{111744}You're not crazy, Margo.|Don't you see, girl?
{111751}{111836}It's the Callisto Effect.|It's really true.
{111839}{111906}The Kothoga myth|was based on fact.
{111909}{111981}People of the Zenzera tribe,|when they were threatened by an enemy,
{111984}{112060}they must have fed some of those|hormonal leaves to some animal,
{112063}{112162}and it caused a riot in its DNA,|and it was transformed into
{112165}{112254}some horrific beast, but the beast|needed those hormones to stay alive.
{112257}{112325}So when it was big enough|and deadly enough, they stopped feeding it.
{112328}{112397}So it would have to find some other way|to get the hormone.
{112400}{112494}Their enemies. Yes, and when the enemies|were dead, it had no more hormones,
{112497}{112578}it would eventually die and the Zenzera|would come out from hiding.
{112581}{112666}Well, we don't have time to wait|for eventually. So, here's my question.
{112669}{112752}- How the fuck do we kill that thing?|- I have to figure out what this is first.
{112755}{112785}We need to get back to my lab.
{112788}{112834}I'll never make it up those stairs.|You leave me here.
{112837}{112873}- I'll carry you.|- Don't be ridiculous.
{112876}{112956}You have more important things to do.|I'm staying here.
{113657}{113698}Right here!
{113821}{113896}All right, it's Martin.|I'm here on the ground.
{113958}{114033}Let's clear this area.|Clear the steps.
{114424}{114494}First I liquefy and|purify my sample.
{114497}{114597}Then this machine will amplify|the DNA strand,
{114617}{114703}and finally scan|the created gel image.
{114706}{114794}Then it's matched against a huge database|we've compiled over the last three years.
{114797}{114844}Very impressive.
{114866}{114931}- How long is this gonna take?|- A little while.
{114934}{114978}- That's terrific.|- What have you got there?
{114981}{115032}Good luck bullet.
{115065}{115129}- Superstitious. I remember now.|- Yeah.
{115132}{115218}- So, does your bullet have a story?|- I was on the beat my rookie year,
{115221}{115282}and I saw this guy|who'd locked his keys in his car
{115285}{115311}with his motor running.
{115314}{115382}He's got a clothes hanger|and he's trying to get the lock off.
{115385}{115414}So I go over,|try to help him out,
{115417}{115470}and what I didn't know was|that he'd just robbed
{115473}{115569}a liquor store a block away.|So, he's concentrating so hard, you know.
{115572}{115658}He doesn't see me|till I'm right up on top of him.
{115661}{115729}I surprise him. He turns and...
{115764}{115820}Point blank range.
{115831}{115898}It doesn't pop, though.
{115901}{115988}Doesn't go off. This bullet.
{116128}{116170}So, what did you do?
{116173}{116235}I took the gun away from him|and beat the shit out of him.
{116238}{116343}Anyway, the forensics told me later|that the bullet's perfect.
{116346}{116418}It should have fired.|I should be dead.
{116422}{116537}- So, in other words, a miracle of physics.|- Maybe just plain old-fashioned good luck.
{116681}{116724}This is Martin.|Has anybody seen the Mayor?
{116727}{116775}Give me a location on the Mayor.
{116916}{116951}What people don't realize is that
{116954}{117018}molecular biology is|the science of the future.
{117021}{117066}You know what I mean?|If people were just given...
{117069}{117168}I'm not taking the fall for this fiasco,|I can tell you that.
{117189}{117266}Come Monday morning,|everything will get straightened out.
{117269}{117370}And whatever prankster|created this miasma, I swear to god,
{117373}{117433}when I get my hands on him...
{117862}{117901}God!
{119877}{119943}There's no exact match here.|Surprise, surprise.
{119946}{120008}4%. 2%... Wait a minute.
{120011}{120066}Hemidactylus turcicus 45%?
{120069}{120135}- It's a gecko, same as the beetle.|- What are you talking about?
{120138}{120202}Well, whatever this thing was,|it ate those leaves
{120205}{120292}and is rapidly evolving|into something reptilian.
{120306}{120367}- You mean it's still changing.|- It's quite possible.
{123110}{123196}Help! Pull me up! Pull me up!
{123199}{123264}- We got you!|- We got you!
{123288}{123366}Pull me up, man! Pull me up!
{123426}{123489}Help me! Help!
{123561}{123624}- Help me!|- Hold on! Hold on!
{123627}{123690}Please! God!
{123748}{123827}Help me! Help! Help me!
{125033}{125068}- It can't be.|- What? What is it?
{125071}{125135}33% homo sapien.
{125138}{125223}- Are you telling me that thing's part human?|- No, I'm saying more than that.
{125226}{125293}According to this data,|that thing started out as a human.
{125296}{125348}I'm gonna keep scanning.|There must be some error.
{125351}{125392}Lieutenant.
{125398}{125456}Hollingsworth. Where are you?
{125459}{125513}I'm just about to take them|into the coal tunnels.
{125516}{125562}Shit. I think that thing|is following us, Lieutenant.
{125565}{125598}I think it knows where we are.
{125601}{125709}Okay, now, listen. Those tunnels lead|right across the street. Just keep going.
{125712}{125750}Get those people out.
{125753}{125832}We're gonna follow you|and decoy the fucker away.
{125853}{125898}Hollingsworth.
{125950}{126005}I'll see you out on the street.
{126107}{126184}Where are those leaves with the hormones|that thing likes to eat?
{126219}{126298}Okay, we know this thing is part reptilian,|probably ectothermic,
{126301}{126359}so it can't handle|extremes of hot and cold.
{126362}{126458}Maybe if we can change its temperature|by 30 to 40 degrees...
{126469}{126542}- What do you mean "maybe"?|- We can freeze the son of a bitch.
{126545}{126599}- Come on.|- Here.
{126889}{127007}- Dr. Frock?|- Let me go first.
{127198}{127287}- Don't look.|- No, no, no!
{127524}{127571}I'm really sorry.
{127813}{127857}Let's go.
{128547}{128609}Get me more guns, god damn it!
{128715}{128774}Hollingsworth, you read me?
{128777}{128836}Hollingsworth, you read me?
{128858}{128935}Yeah, Lieutenant, I'm here.|Scared shitless.
{128938}{129023}- But I'm here.|- Just keep moving. We're on our way.
{129050}{129090}You hear me?
{129093}{129158}- You read me?|- Yeah. I got it.
{129161}{129191}I hope you know what we're doing.
{129194}{129250}- What was that?|- Just keep moving.
{129253}{129309}Just keep moving.
{130165}{130218}Hang on. Hang on.
{130273}{130324}Okay. Let's go.
{130462}{130497}- Bailey!|- Yeah?
{130500}{130556}It's not getting any deeper,|so keep them moving.
{130559}{130623}- All right.|- And watch your back.
{130695}{130744}Okay.
{131065}{131111}- Bailey.|- Yeah?
{131114}{131157}You hear something?
{131306}{131346}No.
{131405}{131449}Bailey!
{131497}{131539}Bailey!
{131576}{131618}Bailey!
{131705}{131740}Move out of the way.
{131743}{131784}Move!
{131821}{131880}Stay back!
{131917}{131958}Move!
{131969}{132025}- Bailey!|- What do you see?
{132123}{132170}I can't run.
{132735}{132819}This way, everybody. Go.
{133421}{133461}Listen up.
{133464}{133542}Now, whatever that was,|something made it go the other way.
{133545}{133639}So stay close to me|and I will get you out of here.
{133695}{133745}Give me the leaves.
{133757}{133811}I'm gonna take them and tie them|on that grate over there.
{133814}{133880}I think the draft will blow|the smell down the tunnels.
{135919}{135958}Come on.
{136348}{136397}Go! Hurry!
{136481}{136530}I found it.
{136579}{136646}- Good. Go! Go!|- Oh, thank god, we're out!
{136649}{136701}We're out, thank god.
{136725}{136797}- All right. All right. Everybody.|- Hurry.
{136800}{136879}- Let's go. All right.|- Come on, don't panic.
{137605}{137666}I'll need some help|for Dr. Cuthbert.
{137933}{137989}Give me that.|Get inside the lab and lock the door.
{137992}{138038}- What about you?|- Just get inside. I'll hold it off.
{138041}{138089}- Hold it off? You've seen that thing.|- Yeah, I've seen it.
{138092}{138146}Look, I know if we keep going,|we can find a way out.
{138149}{138192}I don't want a way out.|We've got to stop it.
{138195}{138241}I'll stay with you.
{138244}{138270}- Get inside.|- This is crazy.
{138273}{138328}- Get inside! Now!|- This is...
{138466}{138584}- This is stupid! Don't do this!|- Lock the goddamn door!
{138609}{138674}This is so stupid!
{139218}{139280}John Whitney? Oh, my god!
{139341}{139387}Lieutenant!
{139571}{139685}Dr. Green!|Dr. Green! Open the door!
{140393}{140443}Open the goddamn door!
{143443}{143517}Come on. Oh, god! Oh, god!
{143611}{143652}Come on.
{143669}{143756}Oh, god! Just keep coming.
{143766}{143808}Oh, god!
{143817}{143866}Just keep coming.
{143869}{143920}Attaboy.
{144187}{144229}Oh, god!
{144411}{144473}Look, I...
{144485}{144536}I know who you are.
{145033}{145088}Oh, god!
{147261}{147305}You go to hell!
{148117}{148163}Captain, we finally|got through that door.
{148166}{148216}We found two more bodies|inside the main room.
{148219}{148251}- Not the Mayor.|- I can't tell, sir.
{148254}{148297}- They're pretty badly messed up.|- How about the others?
{148300}{148352}Well, we got the power up,|trying to get into the other levels,
{148355}{148420}- but it's a big place.|- When I get my hands on that D'Agosta,
{148423}{148494}- he'll be back in a fucking squad car.|- Captain.
{148506}{148562}- Are you in charge here?|- Mr. Mayor.
{148565}{148596}How'd you get out?
{148599}{148638}It's a long story, Captain.
{148641}{148682}Look, these people|are cold and tired.
{148685}{148736}I'd like to get them under a roof|as soon as possible.
{148739}{148795}- Yes, sir.|- And leave De Augusta alone.
{148798}{148867}Or else you might be back|in that squad car.
{149037}{149091}Lieutenant!
{149104}{149194}- Jesus! You all right? You okay?|- I'm okay. Get me up.
{149205}{149264}- Get me up.|- All right.
{149365}{149411}- Let's go! Let's go!|- Go, go, go!
{149414}{149459}Get in there.
{149516}{149552}- Have you seen Dr. Green?|- No.
{149555}{149602}- Did you get those people out?|- Most of them.
{149605}{149644}- Lieutenant, over here.|- You did well.
{149647}{149704}- There's somebody inside.|- Open it up.
{149707}{149747}Open it up.
{150289}{150340}That's all we got here.
{150566}{150608}Keep it.
{150640}{150688}Let's go.
Mrs. Claus is hot!
Yeah!
My name is Samantha Caine.
At least, I think it is.
You might not believe it to look at me, but I was born only years eight ago... on a beach in New Jersey.
I entered the world fully grown, wearing clothes I don't remember buying.
In the back pocket a single key... filed blank and faceless.
A fitting metaphor, but otherwise no help whatsoever. None.
Sometimes I stand naked in the mirror... try to guess my age.
Thirty-five, maybe?
I have lots of scars.
They call my condition focal retrograde amnesia.
It's no picnic, but I've learned to live with it.
Got a job I love, been seeing someone.
Nice guy. Good sense of humor.
- Hound of the Baskervilles.
- Mad dogs. Mad dogs.
- Hal, I gotta tell you.
- Yes? Yes?
Of all the Christmas pageants
I have ever seen... this was by far the most recent.
Ha, ha.
For God's sakes, Sam...
I've got teenage girls that are playing the Three Wise Men.
What'd you expect?
Teenage boys?
I thought they did fine.
It was the first nativity where Joseph stares at the Wise Men's tits all night.
Yeah? Ha, ha.
Her name is Caitlin, and when I woke up on that long-ago day...
I was two months pregnant with her.
I don't know who her father is.
I may never.
I just know she's mine.
His name is Mr. Perkins.
My mom named him for me.
- Caitlin! Come help in the kitchen!
- That's her.
- That's who?
- Her mom.
She's got amnesia.
- Swear?
- Swear.
Too weird.
Hello, girls.
Caitlin, come help me in the kitchen.
Hurry up, because I forget where it is.
- Bah!
- Ha, ha.
Some more sugar.
Raymond! If I catch you smoking again... they'll never find the body.
Understand?
- Yes, Miss Caine.
- Have a cookie.
- Quiet, everybody.
- As the year draws to a close, I would like...
I would like to share with you a few things about myself... things of which I am especially proud.
First, I'm proud to say that I don't smoke...
I don't drink, and I don't swear.
- Oh, shit, I do smoke and drink.
- Hal.
- You see, right there.
- Block your ears.
To our dear friends... may the best of your past be the worst of your future.
I'll drink to that.
Take a bow, my dear. Take a bow.
We got the mistletoe.
Oh, sweetie.
Eight years.
Except for my name, all traces are lost.
I used to hire expensive detectives.
Now I'm down to the cheap ones.
Doesn't seem to matter.
The woman I was, the one I used to be, she's gone.
I've kissed her good night.
- Ha, ha.
- Police. Don't move.
What the hell is this?
Don't give me attitude, sir.
See, you're assuming
I won't shoot your sorry ass... and everyone knows, when you make an assumption... you make an ass out of "u" and "mption."
I'm Sergeant Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff...
I will see to it you spend the next
10 years in prison getting ass-fucked.
If the case is thrown out because my arrest was too violent...
I will personally hire men to ass-fuck you for the next 10 years.
So if you're an ass-fucking fan, you go ahead and mouth off.
Meanwhile, you're under arrest for the crime of prostitution.
Officer Donlevy, read him his rights.
- What?
- His rights.
You have the remight...
You have the right to remain silent.
And anything you say and do will be held against you in a...
You gotta listen to me, man.
I got a wife. This... I've never...
This is the first time I've done this.
Sir, sir.
Listen to me. I can see from your choice you're not a wealthy man.
Now, in light of the damage that this arrest could do to you... we might be able to make some arrangement.
God!
Gotta stop using bums.
Forget that.
They looked like cops.
We pulled it off, didn't we?
It was embarrassing.
Want me to hire actors, for chrissake?
These guys are cheap.
They work for food.
When they puke on you, is that a refund?
Oh, Trin...
I'm pissing myself here, you're so funny.
- What's this?
- I got movement on Samantha Caine.
- You're kidding.
- Nope. I may have a lead on someone... who rented Amnesia Chick an apartment back in '87.
They still have some of her stuff.
Get out of here.
Where'd that come from?
Lucky break. Old lady died and one of her asshole grandkids... found a credit card in a shoe box... name Samantha Caine on it.
Tried to use it at Nordstrom's.
Okay, here's what we do.
You get on the phone to Amnesia Chick.
Tell her we need more cash.
Hey, that was a really swell party.
Thanks again for the ride.
You and Hal, you've been together now, what?
What? A couple of years?
How often do you two...?
Stick our fingers in our hands and pull them out again?
Every chance we get.
Earl, do me a favor.
Have bubbles come out of your mouth and say, "Hic."
Goddamn it, I am not drunk.
Here, I'll prove it to you.
Hey. Hey, come on.
Hey! Stop that!
- I'm sorry.
- No!
And so much for the skydiving Santa of Hutchinson County.
Meanwhile, WICC News journeyed to Honesdale today... where Santa's Mrs. Kringle turned out to celebrate... her hubby's worldwide tour.
And after one look at her...
I'm thinking Santa got what he really wanted this Christmas.
The parade included floats and participants from four counties.
Everyone enjoyed themselves, especially the young and the young at heart.
Up next...
Gotta be fucking kidding!
No.
No fucking way!
It's impossible!
So you rest up.
And I'll see you in the morning.
Sweet dreams.
I want a cigarette.
I don't smoke.
You used to.
See how easy it comes back?
I'm coming back.
You know that, don't you?
Name's Charly, by the way.
You're gonna love me.
Now, this is the intergalactic slammer. It's a jail, all right?
This guy here, this is the Borium Dude.
He's kind of like a dinosaur.
And this is his escape chute.
He's mean, quick, and he don't take no shit, either, all right?
He can shoot at the guards with his arrow right here.
- It's cool?
- Todd, time for dinner.
Now.
Guess you'd better go in.
Hey, hope you like the toy.
It's awesome.
Dad, Mom, she gets weird.
Like on my birthday when you gave me that Schwinn... she called the bicycle store to see if there's been any robberies.
Look, tell her I don't steal them locally, all right? Ha, ha.
Man.
Sorry, but I can't take this.
You know how Mom will get.
- Guess I'll see you.
- Yeah. All right.
How do you like that?
Yo, Trin. Me. What's up?
- Ready to be happy?
- Yeah.
Remember the landlady I told you about?
The Caine woman was her favorite tenant.
Then one day, the tenant never comes home.
Old lady very sad.
So sad, she can't throw away
Amnesia Chick's shit.
It's pay dirt, Mitch.
Got an old postcard, never mailed.
Woman telling everyone she just got engaged.
Samantha's handwriting. Perfect match.
She was engaged to some guy in Jersey.
No phone number, just an address.
Holy shit. Score.
Sweetheart, that's worth time and a half.
Double. I made us look good.
Her other PIs couldn't find dick.
Of course not.
Took a true dick-hound like yourself.
Tell Miss Caine I'm coming to see her tonight.
Honey, you have an ETA on that carrot?
Stow it.
Maybe you should just take it with you to school tomorrow.
- Ha, ha. You're killing me. You're so funny.
- Ha, ha.
Here. Here. Give me the knife.
I'm gonna cut this carrot... and you'll eat the blood-soaked pieces and like it. Piss off.
Hon?
Look at something, will you?
How the hell do you...?
I used to do this.
I'm a chef. Yahoo!
Look what she's doing here.
Give me something else.
Quick. Anything.
- Here.
- Go. I'm hot to trot.
- Tomato, tomato.
- Tomato!
Look at this.
Look at this woman go. Okay, okay, fine.
More.
Pepper! Pepper! Celery!
Look at this!
- More! More!
- Scallions!
Scallions. Give her scallions.
One more tomato.
Look at this. Look at this woman.
She's amazing!
Chefs do that.
Timothy, I know you're gonna kill me. I know you're gonna kill me.
Please use the gun, not the knife.
As a favor to me. I'm begging you.
Goddamn it, how can I tell the feds about the fucking Honeymoon thing?
I don't know a fucking thing about it.
No, you don't.
I don't know a fucking thing.
You know, I can tell when someone's lying to me.
What's so fucking important?
Remember your old colleague...
One-Eyed Jack?
Yeah. He's doing seven to 10 upstate.
Not anymore. He broke out.
Two days after seeing something on TV that "disturbed" him.
Yeah, me too.
It's called Baywatch Nights.
Wanna get to the fucking point?
While under sedation, he said Charly Baltimore's alive, sir.
Daedalus is understandably concerned.
He was under the impression you disposed of her eight years ago.
I know it's unlikely, but if she were alive...
I think she might be in contact with the old man in Massachusetts.
Tap his phone.
Tell Daedalus I'm on my way.
Timothy out.
I can't see Mr. Perkins.
He's there. He's on the sled. See him?
He's watching you.
He's very excited.
Oh, that's better.
Ready to try it alone?
I want you to hold my hand.
Oh. Just pretend I am.
You can do it.
Piece of cake. Here we go.
Ready?
- Mom, it won't work, I swear.
- Sure, it will!
You're one of the X-Men. You're tough.
Ready? Let's go.
Three, two, one, go.
Wait! I'm not ready!
Go! Go!
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!
I can't do it. I wanna go home.
Look, I know you're afraid.
That's the whole point.
Can't you see that?
Stop being a little baby and get up.
I can't skate anymore. My wrist hurts.
Life is pain.
Get used to it.
See, you will skate all the way to the shore, princess... and you will not fall again.
Am I understood?
I'm just guessing, but this is a tree house.
I think you wanted a doghouse.
Little joke.
She said that her wrist hurt.
I didn't know it was fractured.
I don't remember... what I said to her.
I can't remember.
No!
For God's sake, I'm not gonna hurt you.
It's not me I'm worried about.
Evening, Charly.
Long time.
- Mommy!
- Get out!
Mommy! Help!
Mommy!
I want my eye back, bitch!
No!
Chefs do that.
Caitlin.
Oh, my God!
We have to find Caitlin! Caitlin!
Caitlin! No!
Slow down, slow down!
Your kid's okay. She's in my car.
Jesus! What the hell's going on here?
Freeze!
Don't hurt him!
Don't shoot!
Yeah, don't shoot, like she said!
Call an ambulance!
This man, he's going to help me find out some things... so we'll be safe. You understand?
When will you be back home?
Before you know it, I swear.
Here. I want you to keep a candle burning... in a window for me.
That's called keeping a vigil.
Okay?
That's to light my way home.
Here.
This is to my portable phone.
I keep it with me.
You call me any time.
Okay?
Why don't you keep this?
For luck.
Let's have Mr. Perkins wear it.
There. See?
You do what you have to.
But, Sam... the person you used to be...
Whatever you find, I'm not scared.
I never will be, not ever.
Thank you.
Bye.
Mr. Perkins, you lost one of your agents... whose training included, among other things... counter-assassination.
And now she turns up as belle of the Christmas parade.
Well, that information is two weeks old, Mr. President.
To my knowledge,
Charlene Baltimore died... in my employ, relic of the Cold War.
The kind of violent operative that has since been eliminated from our ranks.
You recruited this woman?
For Chapter, sir.
In the late '70s her father was a friend of mine.
Stop that.
I don't wanna hear that stuff.
Intelligence community.
You people are unbelievable.
You dump a mess like this in my lap... and then you come whining to me and say, "Where is our funding?"
Well, I'll tell you where it is.
Can you say "healthcare"?
I'm not talking about the linen
And I don't wanna change your life
Moving in.
What?
It's...
It's... The song's not about linen.
It's not linen.
Yeah, whatever. So you cold?
Yeah. Freezing.
I'll turn on the heat.
Doesn't work, but it makes an annoying noise...
- ...distracts from the cold.
- I'll pass.
Thanks.
Who knew I had an old fiancé?
And now we're just gonna pay a surprise visit?
Well, there are no bells or whistles going off... because I don't remember any of this.
Jeez, that's too bad, because that's the cream of the crop, believe me.
I forgot to ask.
Why is it that you got so far?
Say what?
Well, I mean... you seem kind of low-rent.
No offense.
None taken.
Really, I was about to... Hey!
Hey, now!
Yeah.
Shit.
Are you okay?
Is your neck all right?
You don't have whiplash?
What?
I'm just...
Since you almost just ran us off the road...
I'm wondering, what it is that you take away... from an experience like that.
Don't get me wrong. I mean,
I'm sure it's very enriching in some way.
And I know that she was probably very moved... by having some asshole hang out the window and go, "Woo-hoo!"
Hey, I didn't hang out the window and go, "Woo, woo, woo."
I checked out her form, okay?
If it's any consolation, you got her beat hands down.
- Really?
- Yeah.
From the neck up.
This is exciting.
You saw her tits. It's so neat.
Look, it's a guy thing, all right?
Hey, now, you got a nice body and all... but those, you could see them coming around the corner.
You got time to comb your hair. Shit.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's that?
Charly was my name in the dream.
"To Charly. Love, Nathan."
Nathan J. Waldman, Ph.D.
- All right. Let's find a phone.
- Found one.
Find his number.
Take the stand.
I got it. Now what'll I do with it?
Sit down!
Alice, please.
Your dog, Alice.
It and my appetite are mutually exclusive.
- Well, what's wrong with the dog?
- It's simple.
He's been licking his asshole for the last three straight hours.
I submit there is nothing there worth more than an hour's attention... and I should think that whatever he is attempting to dislodge... is either gone for good or there to stay.
Wouldn't you agree?
Yes. Hello.
Mr. Waldman?
I got your number from a Realtor... in Massachusetts, and I'd just like to speak to you.
Who is this?
You tell me, Mr. Waldman.
Charly.
My full name, please.
God.
It's really you.
Chapter, they think you're dead.
- Everyone thinks...
- My full name, please.
You don't know your name?
Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.
Don't talk, Charly. Just listen.
You could be in danger. Understand?
We must meet.
We must meet straightaway.
Where are you now?
Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.
We'll meet halfway.
There's a town in New Jersey,
Chestermon.
Tomorrow, Central Train Station... at 11 a.m.
Meet me.
I'll tell you everything.
Signal Daedalus. We got her.
- Some what?
- Curry brand cat food.
- Could you spell that?
- Yeah. Curry brand.
All this shit is the same.
You don't happen to have a cat by any chance...?
What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.
Yeah. Pussy's pussy.
You got a girl, I got a cat.
Mom, can I stay up for Rugrats?
What, sweetie? I lost you.
Rugrats. I want to stay up.
- Yes. You can stay up for Rugrats.
- Oh, good.
I'm gonna go now.
All right.
- Mommy loves you.
- I love you too.
Big kiss.
- Bye, Mom.
- Good night.
Put my glasses in my pocket
Put the jacket on the chair
I sing the things I do, you know, so I won't forget.
Like:
Turning off the downstairs light
Before I go to bed at night
Shit.
I can't take this fucking waiting.
Excuse me.
Do you normally curse this much?
I didn't...
What, are you a Mormon?
Yes, I'm a Mormon.
That's why I just smoked a pack of Newport and drank three vodka tonics.
What I'm saying is... back when we first met... you were all like, "Oh, phooey.
I burned the darn muffins."
Now, you go into a bar, 10 minutes later, sailors come running out.
What up with that?
Thanks for sharing.
Mind your own damn business.
While you're at it, if you're gonna smoke inside... close the damn door.
No!
Hey, I heard you screaming.
Shit!
Henessey, I didn't know about the gun.
I wasn't hiding things. I swear.
Goddamn it. Stop walking.
I'm going home.
- Hey!
- And so are you!
I paid you!
Well, here. Here.
Take your money. Take it!
I can't go home... until I know why that man tried to kill me.
I'm trapped.
It's like I'm in goddamn prison.
- Do you know how that feels?
- Yeah!
Yeah, I know exactly what that's like.
Four years inside! Marion, Illinois.
A real shithole.
And I'm not going back!
Seven years ago I was an Atlanta cop.
Me and my partner handled a lot of impounded shit.
That motherfucker hated me.
I forget why, but he did.
Well, one weekend, when he was conveniently away... some bonds disappeared from his office.
Lo and behold, when my brothers in blue responded to an anonymous tip... you'll never guess what they found sitting in my closet.
The bonds. Your partner put them there.
Oh, no, no, no. I did.
I stole the damn things.
I never did one thing right in my life, you know that?
Not one.
That takes skill.
You just missed our exit.
Give me back my money.
Oh, so you're...?
I'm taking you to the train station, yes, to meet Mr. Waldman.
Merry Christmas.
Bah, humbug.
Look out the window and shut up.
You know we're about 10 minutes early.
Got a bad feeling about this.
Putting the keys in my left pocket
Gun in the right-hand side
Makes a bulge. People can see.
Want me to stick it in my pants, shoot my dick off?
You're a sharpshooter?
Going to shake hands with the man
- How you doing?
- Hi.
That's for you.
Another in a long line of bad personal investments.
Excuse me?
I just saw the ring on your finger.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Back up.
Total pickup line.
Forget I said it. I take it back.
Thank you for the beer, but I don't know you. No.
No, you don't.
And I can tell when someone's lying to me.
I am sorry to have bothered you.
- Yours?
- Yeah.
Who's your boyfriend?
Oh, some guy.
Okay, people. I got what I need.
Move in. Do them both.
Hey, hey.
That man walking this way.
Is that him?
I think so.
Mr. Waldman?
Gun!
Jesus wept.
Let's go, Miss Caine.
We gotta get to the car.
This way! This way! This way!
Come on! Come on! Go!
No! No! No! Come on!
Shit, there's more of them!
No! No! No! This way!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, Miss Caine! Come on!
Come on, goddamn it! Come on!
- Where are they?
- Oh, shit!
Here, take this. Take it. Take it.
I got three shots left in this revolver.
You got a full clip.
Just point and spray, okay?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
And...
Fuck it! Run for your life!
There's no way out!
Jump!
That's a three-story drop! Are you crazy?
- What happened?
- I saved your ass. It was great.
Come on. We gotta get to the car.
Come on! Come on! This way! This way!
Come on. Come on.
Get down! Get down! Get down!
Get in, both of you. Now!
I said, now!
We jumped out of a building.
Yes. It was very exciting.
Tomorrow, we go to the zoo.
You're Waldman.
No, I'm the Hills Bros.' bean buyer.
Who else would I be? Hang on.
If you want me to talk in front of him, you may be asked to kill him later.
- What?
- Your call.
- What?
- Fire out the back if you have to.
Jesus, old man.
How many of those things you got?
Three. One shoulder, one hip, and one next to Mr. Wally... where patdowns never reveal it... as an agent's often reluctant to feel up a man's groin.
- Any other questions?
- What's the weather like on your planet?
Charlene, my darling.
My name is Samantha. Samantha Caine.
No, no, no! Forget all that.
That teacher business was your cover.
Do you hear me, Charly?
Hear what I'm saying?
Your memory was gone. You got confused.
You bought your own cover.
It was a fantasy, for chrissake!
Samantha Caine never existed.
You wrote the bloody thing.
No. It's not a fantasy.
I'm in the goddamn PTA.
Then quit!
You're an assassin working for the United States government.
I ought to know.
I trained you.
Get the fuck out of here! Ha, ha.
Assassin? Ha, ha.
Your father was in the Royal lrish Rangers, assigned to Belfast.
After he was murdered there in 1975... his friend Perkins adopted you.
Or perhaps I should say recruited you... to work for Chapter, a black-bag operation working from the U.S. State Department.
You getting this?
October, 1988.
You're assigned to take out a munitions dealer, Daedalus... and his hired enforcer, Timothy.
You failed to complete your mission... electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary.
And dead you remained until, without preamble... you re-emerge eight years later and a good deal frumpier.
Anyhow, I think we can safely assume... that Daedalus is aware of your resurrection... and attempting to reverse it.
He'll be watching the police, watching hospitals.
We must stay away. Understand?
Yes, Mr. Henessey? Can I help you?
Henessey, what is it?
It's a setup. It's gotta be.
Put that down.
This is not an episode of television.
Those guys back there at the train station, how'd they know we'd be there?
Impossible, unless Waldman here told them.
- I did not.
- They tapped your phone at least.
I know it sounds preposterous...
Oh, just happened to know we'd be calling?
Get in the car.
See here, my friend...
Oh, shit!
Oh, damn!
Get in the car now!
So how about it?
You believe any of that crap he said back there?
Oh, I don't... No.
That guy was a lunatic.
We gotta talk to someone else.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I hope not, because I'm thinking how much my balls hurt.
But if you're talking about that postcard,
I don't wanna meet more of your friends.
We have no choice.
We need some answers or we're gonna die.
I saw you from the road.
I think your name is Luke... and I think I was gonna marry you.
Charly?
Oh, baby. Hey.
Oh, man.
Luke.
She's my only daughter... and I don't quite trust you yet.
So, what about it?
You and Mr. Outdoors here bump pelvis?
It's possible.
How about your daughter?
- What's her name? Cat head?
- Caitlin.
Yeah, well, you think he might be the father?
I don't know. I don't know.
But all these little details about him are coming back.
I'm remembering things about him.
Like what?
Look, is this America's Funniest
Practical Videos or something?
Keep your hands where I can see them.
I had an itch.
Charly, this is crazy.
You and me, we were like...
Don't you remember?
Hell, you pursued me.
I know that he has a pin in his leg.
Car accident.
I know he... He cuts his own hair.
He doesn't even own a TV.
He sits down when he pees...
Hey, that's enough.
I'm getting a boner here, all right?
Henessey, I know this man, okay?
I must have been seeing him.
Let me talk to him.
Alone.
I'm sorry.
You wanna take a walk?
Got me a handgun
Got a rifle too
Anybody fucks with Mitch
He knows just what to do
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker
Stay quiet and drop the rifle.
How'd you find us?
There may be reasons not to kill you... but among them is not that you'll be missed by NASA.
I found the address in your coat.
Here.
Between the address of a topless bar... and the picture of what looks like a man's penis.
That's a duck, not a dick.
The man she's with, who is he?
He's her former fiancé. His name's Luke.
- Former fiancé?
- Hey, hey, hey.
That's ridiculous.
She was never engaged.
For chrissake,
I went through this with her.
She knows how the man pees.
Look at him. He's cool.
A former fiancé.
Why on earth would she think that?
We found a note. It's in her handwriting.
- She saw a note?
- Who are you, William Shatner? Calm down.
Yeah, a note to her uncle.
- Max?
- Yeah.
Uncle Max.
That's the agency, you blithering idiot.
And the word "engaged" means she's locked on to target. Fuck!
He's not her former lover, he's a target?
That's why she knows personal things.
She studied the bastard to assassinate him.
Stop!
- Charly!
- Stop!
- Charly!
- He's Daedalus!
- Get out of there!
- It's him!
He is Daedalus, Charly!
Well, howdy there.
If it isn't the forgetful spy.
How you feeling?
You're the man from the bar.
Would you look at her?
She's not faking it.
She doesn't know me from Adam.
It's not that I don't trust my compadre here, Major Baltimore.
In fact, I had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine... until you showed up here.
You follow?
I'm trying to pull off the biggest job of my career... so you see, darling,
I have to know how much about me... you really remember, and who you told.
I haven't told a soul. I swear.
We'll soon know.
What is this? Some kind of torture thing?
Torture, yes.
A woman's face never looks quite so beautiful... as when it's distended in pain.
Witness the beauty of childbirth.
- Untie me and I'll make any face you want.
- Let's not and say we did.
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna do the torture thing.
Operation Honeymoon's on schedule.
I've secured the tanker.
Now I just gotta make the soup.
I'll follow as soon as I'm done here.
Ten minutes in this cold water, she'll be insane or dead.
Five minutes.
She'll tell me everything I need.
That's right. Take all the air you can.
If you need to vomit, do it now.
So you don't remember anything at all?
Best night of your fucking life.
I say drown the wench.
Talk to me, major.
Is my identity safe?
My name is Samantha Caine.
Answer the question.
Who knows about me?
Nobody. Fuck you!
Fuck you!
I hate to see you like this, Charly.
I heard you were a hell of a spy once.
Watch your back.
I'm not done yet.
Good night.
Okay. I'll signal Daedalus.
Your money will be waiting.
Jack?
Jack. Jack!
Do yourself a favor, man.
Don't let her looks fool you.
She's the Energizer fucking Bunny.
Just do her and dump her.
Don't try to get cute and play doctor first.
I made that mistake. It nearly killed me.
Motherfucker!
Daedalus...
I'll make you a deal.
Let me go now... and I'll leave you the use of your legs.
Why have you resurfaced?
Is it Operation Honeymoon? Is that it?
Who sent you?
Why are you here?
I let you touch me, cowboy.
I think I need a bath.
Samantha, please.
Who's Samantha?
Where's Henessey?
The lengthening of its neck makes it easier for it to swim.
Its front feet are larger... and that's good, to have paddle-like feet to move through water...
Hey, Mitch.
You're awake.
You're seeping.
Here. Look at this.
Shit.
That hurt like shit.
I know. That's why I distracted you first.
Same principle as deflowering virgins.
What? Virg...? What?
I read it in this Harold Robbins book.
Guy bites her on the ear, distracts from the pain.
You ever try that?
No, no. I sock them in the jaw and yell, "Pop goes the weasel."
Who the fuck are you?
The name's Charly.
The spy.
Nice to meet you.
Drink?
Yeah.
Now, as you can see, things are still very crazy here... but the sheriff has told me this:
There have been gunshots, and yes...
Okay, let's say I buy it.
You are a trained killer.
I can't even say that with a straight face.
So Samantha, she...
Never really existed.
Like Nathan said, she was a total fabrication.
I made her up.
So now she's just gone forever and ever?
Thank God.
Look at my inordinately large ass.
Look what she did to me.
Pretty convincing act.
I guess.
You know, her personality had to come from somewhere.
Change the subject.
Better yet, bring me that bottle.
Here you go. Drink up.
So, what's next?
What do we do now?
I contact Chapter.
I come in for debriefing... bury the last eight years... get back to work.
Cheers.
Would you believe it, Harry?
We got an appropriations review in three weeks... and the president wants to know how I lost an agent.
Yes, sir. You have a call on line 3, sir.
Gonna tell me who it is?
Charly Baltimore, sir.
Run a trace.
This is Mr. Perkins.
Turn on the TV.
Farm in New Jersey. Seven dead.
Charly.
Good Lord, girl.
We've been looking all over for you.
I got a photo of you in a Christmas parade.
What the hell is happening?
Don't be stupid.
I completed my assignment.
You mean Daedalus?
I shot him. He's pretty much dead.
Actually, I would have done it earlier, say back in '92... but I was baking. Don't ask.
I wanna come in.
Sure. Of course.
Let me direct you to a safe house.
Forget it. We play it my way.
You want me back, then you stay away.
I'll call you.
Those are the rules, understand?
Shit.
Did you hear that?
If she got to Daedalus... she could know about Honeymoon.
She might know that old targets have become your new best friends.
That could be trouble.
Goddamn you.
There were weapons at that farm.
She's armed now.
Stop having kittens.
You're the head of a major spy network, and you have a tendency to whine.
Do you realize that?
She could compromise this entire operation.
We have 24 hours.
We find her... then we kill her.
Do whatever it takes, but be careful.
If it gets out you work for me...
I'll be grabbing my ankles on the White House lawn.
The lady's wacked, Trin.
She's lost it. I gotta get out of here.
Look, I need you to meet me.
I'll sneak back out to this phone and call you at midnight with the details.
Bye.
All right, Sam. What did that accomplish?
I'm testing our boy Perkins.
Got a light?
I don't really trust him.
Come again?
A little experiment.
If he was looking for me in Pennsylvania, he sure as hell tapped your office.
You mean he just traced that call?
Come midnight, you hang by the phone.
If he wants to erase me... he'll send someone to kidnap and torture you for my whereabouts... in which case, hey, I don't trust him.
No, no, no. Time out.
I haven't had a date in eight years, Mitch.
Is this a fun date?
What's going on?
True love. Shut the fuck up.
Beautiful.
White lady seducing the colored help.
Get real, sweetheart.
I ain't handsome, I ain't rich... and the last time I got blown, candy bars cost a nickel.
What's going on?
Chemistry. Go figure.
Chemistry, my ass.
You know what I think?
I think this is why you'd fuck me.
To kill a schoolteacher.
To bury her once and for all.
I kind of liked that schoolteacher.
When she comes back, give me a call, all right?
Oh, and call your fucking kid.
It's two days to Christmas.
She might be under the mistaken impression
Mommy gives a fuck.
I didn't ask for the kid.
Samantha had the kid, not me.
Nobody asked me.
Merry Christmas.
Good evening, pretty lady.
How about some company?
No, thanks.
I'm saving myself till I get raped.
Step in the alley.
I ain't asking you. I'm telling you.
Fuck.
Goddamn it. You're early.
So Perkins wants me dead?
What's the rush?
Why don't you go away and come back at midnight?
Shoo.
Hey, honey, this is a real big fucking gun.
- This ain't no ham on rye, pal.
- What the hell are you doing?
Saving your life.
I would've come sooner, but I was thinking up that line.
You think I can't take him?
- Probably scared the others away.
- What others?
Headhunters, nimrod.
They don't travel alone.
Were you always this stupid, or did you take lessons?
- I took lessons.
- Hey.
What?
I still got this fucking gun.
Fuck this.
Put that away.
I'm out of here.
Perkins, you prick.
Now you want me dead. Why?
What's going on?
Easy, sport.
I got myself out of Beirut once.
I think I can get out of New Jersey.
Yeah? Well, don't be so sure.
Others have tried and failed.
The entire population, in fact.
You keep saying "I" this,
"I" that, like, well...
It's like you don't need me anymore.
Good point.
Hey, hey, hey.
Get in.
Found a use for me?
Yep.
I'm leaving the country, Mitch.
I need a fake passport, and I need money, lots of it.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Hold on a minute while I pull that out of my ass.
The key, Mitch.
The one I keep on that charm bracelet?
It opens Box 227 in a bank in Buffalo.
How the fuck would you know?
The numbers are filed off.
I filed them off.
There's a briefcase in Box 227.
It's got cash and IDs in it.
I need you to get them for me.
Shit. I should have known.
Okay.
So where's this charm bracelet?
Yeah, well, that's the thing about being a secret agent, Mitch.
Nothing is ever simple.
Drive past. Don't slow down.
You can park under those trees.
Honk if there's any trouble.
Yes, Miss Daisy. I be honking.
Good morning, Raymond.
Good morning, Miss Caine.
What did we learn about the dangers of smoking?
Give it here.
Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me...
I'll blow your fucking head off.
Fuck.
Shoot the son of a bitch.
Oh, shit.
Hi.
You're about to have 2.4 children.
Oh, please.
Merry Christmas.
So how far to the money?
Hour, tops.
I haven't seen a cop in a while.
So, Mitch... still think I'm warm and fuzzy?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Anything?
Phone bill, Christmas card.
You could've aimed for those guys' shoulders.
- Back off, man.
- Ha, ha.
You know, I'm thinking maybe
Samantha Caine wasn't an act.
Yeah, you had amnesia and all... but I think maybe you forgot to hate yourself for a while. How about it?
What the fuck is that?
Oh.
Hello?
It's me. I got your kid.
Give your location. Don't waste time.
State Road 5...
15 minutes east of Union Springs, New York.
I don't like cellular phones, so here's how we do this.
Go to the Holiday Inn nearest you.
There's one in Cayuga.
Be there when I call in 15 minutes.
Who?
He's got the kid.
Timothy?
He's routing me to a landline.
Doesn't want to talk over the airwaves.
Oh, shit.
Maybe we can trace him.
Trace him? How? It's a random hotel.
- How long did he give you?
- Fifteen minutes.
Okay.
Why don't we try the phone company?
Think you can get here in under 15 minutes?
Nobody move.
You.
You've got 40 seconds to run a patch for me.
Everybody up. Against the wall.
Holiday lnn. Chet speaking.
I'd like to page
Charlene Baltimore, please.
Please hold.
Yeah.
Hi. It's me.
No shit. Verify you have the kid.
How else would I get your cellular number?
I got it off the cast on her right wrist.
Right below "Mommy loves you."
I offer up a simple trade.
You for the girl.
I'll tell you where and when.
And, Charly... you fuck with me...
I'll blind the kid and shoot out her knees.
Give me an ANI trace.
Do it.
How do you know so much about this Timothy?
Oh, what do you think?
I bumped pelvises with him.
He was a target, remember?
Ma'am?
That call was placed from Niagara Falls.
Niagara Falls?
Operation Honeymoon.
Bingo.
Perkins.
What's he doing here?
Timothy acting alone, we had a chance.
Charly's hooked.
All we gotta do is set a time and a place.
My God. We're monsters.
You talk to me about Honeymoon.
Tanker's ready.
One terrorist on ice waiting to play patsy.
- And no loose ends?
- No, no. Not that I can tell.
Feds are gonna find them crashed in a ravine five miles from the blast site.
I'm not a complete ogre.
The young one gets a doll to play with for Christmas.
Oh, fuck you.
- I think I should go in first.
- Negative.
You'd just screw it up.
Hey, I'm a much better shot up close.
You couldn't hit a lake if you were on the bottom.
Forget it.
Here.
The guards are at 126.9 megahertz.
You meet me at 127.1 if you need to talk.
As soon as you spot me with the kid, you start laying down cover fire.
All right.
They're gonna blow my head off, you know.
This is the last time I'll ever be pretty.
Northeast sector, all clear.
Roger, Northeast.
Bogey.
Round her up, gentlemen.
I want her alive and unmarked.
Run. She's got the kid.
I smell gasoline.
Did you have a little accident?
I got plenty of matches up here.
It would be a bad way for a kid to go.
Thirty seconds. Think it over.
- Oh!
- Pick him up.
I'm gonna miss you, major.
You ought to have stayed dead.
You don't know the rules anymore.
Tell me about it. Eight years ago, this guy was on the hit list.
Budget cuts, dear.
Congress blinded us overseas.
I was forced to turn to any eyes and ears I could find... even if that meant recruiting the quote-unquote "bad guys" here.
Budget cuts, is that what this is about?
Operation Honeymoon.
Fuck me. You're running a fundraiser.
Fundraiser?
World Trade Center bombing, remember?
During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
The diplomat who issued the terrorists' visa was CIA.
It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing... purely to justify a budget increase.
You're gonna fake some terrorist thing just to scare some money out of Congress?
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Henessey...
I have no idea how to fake killing 4000 people.
So we're just gonna have to do it for real.
Oh, blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
Then I get my funding.
Good night, old girl.
- Timothy, I'll be in Chopper 1.
- All right.
No, no, no. Just her.
Sam.
I'll be waiting for you to come rescue me.
Be just a minute.
Hey.
So you plant this poor Arab to take the fall.
What's going out in the tanker?
Come on.
I'm gonna die. I wanna know.
Okay.
Chemical bomb.
Chain reaction.
Once started, it can't be stopped.
The catalyst injected into the tanker heats up.
We pull the truck into the center of town.
It goes critical around midnight.
Farewell. Adieu.
- Timothy.
- Yeah?
Please... let my kid go.
I'm about all out of favors, there, Chuck.
But I'm already letting you spend time with the kid while you freeze to death.
Now, they're...
They're gonna find your bodies somewhere in Pennsylvania.
And you're just gonna be written off as some crazy mommy... who kidnapped her own kid... died with her in a blizzard.
Goddamn you.
Look at her eyes.
Now, why would I wanna do that?
Because they're yours.
That night with you, I got pregnant.
The little girl is your daughter.
That's priceless.
Would you bring my little bitch in here?
Caitlin.
Hi, princess.
You mind if I take a look at your fucking eyes?
It's all right, Caity.
We're gonna take a nap together.
We'll be like the bears in the winter.
Yeah, bears. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
It ain't over.
You're gonna die screaming.
And I'm gonna watch.
Am I telling the truth?
Mommy, it's cold in here.
Just for a minute.
Polar bears, remember?
Open.
Step over there, sweetie.
Give me a spark.
Hi, Mitch.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
For you, Tim, always a pleasure to wait.
I wanted to tell you this story.
The Grinch, like a mean fucker, but...
Come on. Do it.
Do it!
It being Christmas Eve,
I'm gonna give you a choice.
The knife or the gun.
Do it.
Mommy, don't cry.
I keep these here for lighting your candle.
Oh, Caity.
I love you.
Sam called Washington.
By morning, this place will be crawling with feds.
We're gonna be gone by then, Mitch.
That's what I'm saying.
A couple of feds said they couldn't sleep, so they might come early.
That tanker goes bang at 312 degrees Celsius.
Right in the center of town...
25 minutes from now.
Mommy, am I gonna die?
Oh, no, baby.
No, you're not gonna die.
They are.
Cover your ears.
Hey, should we get a dog?
Bye, Mitch.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, shit.
I know! Watch your fire!
Ha, ha. You foxy bitch.
- Mommy.
- Run, Caity.
Hide.
Caity.
Yeah, Sam, they don't know who they're fucking with.
- Skin looks fine.
- Yeah, looks all right from here.
Where the fuck is that kid going?
Shit.
Move it out! And find that bitch.
All right, people, listen up.
Nothing changes.
Icy roads, five miles past the town limit.
Plant the car in the ravine... and get your asses out of there.
Where'd you go, baby?
Show Mommy.
Sam.
Sam, are you out there?
Sam, where are you?
Mitch. I don't believe it.
I just saw Caitlin climb in the back of the truck.
She's locked in the toolbox, left rear.
Jesus. The truck is a bomb.
Tell me something I don't know.
Timothy rigged it.
Three hundred-twelve degrees, it goes boom.
We got 20 minutes, tops.
I'll go in and get her.
- No chance.
- I'm close.
I make it a dozen with automatic weapons.
So kill them for me, bitch.
What are you good for?
Okay, you can do this.
Mitch, no.
Just do one thing right.
Talk to me, Mitch.
- Please.
- Mitch.
Goddamn it.
Your 9, Mitch, on your 9.
Thirty degrees left, Mitch. Left.
Your other left.
They got you flanked.
Mitch, get out, now!
Mitch! Shit!
Mitch.
Move it out. Let's go.
Okay, listen up.
She's gonna make a try for the payload... so Units 2 and 4, watch your backs.
Sky 1, get me a chopper in the air.
I'm on my way. Out.
Let me through.
Coming through.
Out.
Clear out of the way.
This truck's gonna blow up.
Move.
Sir, she's got the truck.
She's headed out of town.
I'm hurt real bad. I think I'm dying.
Continue dying. Out.
Head her off, please.
Oh, fuck.
No. No!
Oh, not fair.
Not fucking fair.
Get out of the way.
Hang on, Caity.
Suck my dick, every one of you bastards.
- Shit.
- Shit.
Oh, honey, only four inches?
You'll feel me.
No!
No!
Mommy.
She must be in the truck.
Get away from her.
- Mom.
- No!
Help.
Caity.
- Caity.
- Mommy, I hit my head.
Come on.
Okay. Hold on.
Caity, run.
Get out.
Don't go away again, please.
Caity, the truck is a bomb.
It's gonna blow up.
Go.
I'm right behind you, baby.
Go, and don't look back.
Good girl.
Here! Over here!
Mommy, no.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I left.
Please get up.
Charlie Team 1, we're in position and ready to advance.
Charlie 1, that's a negative.
Orders are to stand down until notified.
Would you stop it?
Stop being a little baby.
Get up now. You're not dead.
Don't you die.
You get up now.
Life is pain.
You just get used to it.
So stand up right this minute, Mommy.
You're grounded.
Get me to the bridge.
I'm not leaving till I know that bitch is dead.
Somebody help me.
I got a kid here.
I got my 8-year-old daughter, do you hear me?
Somebody get this motherfucker off me.
- Help me.
- Negative, ma'am.
We understand your request, but...
That's right.
You can't kill me, motherfuckers.
Sam!
Mitch.
Hurry.
- Get in.
- Sam.
Stay here. Here.
- I'm here.
- Sam.
I'm here, you bastard.
I'm here, you bastard!
Die screaming, motherfucker.
Don't let her get to the border!
They're heading for the border!
Go!
Don't hit the cars.
Sorry.
I can't drive anymore.
Okay.
Are you okay?
Are you stupid?
Hey, gorgeous.
You got your mommy's eyes.
Don't let nobody tell you different.
Hey, hang in there, partner.
Did you forget we're rich?
Hello?
I'm putting your call through to the president.
- Hello, Miss Caine.
- Yes, Mr. President.
I owe you.
The country owes you a debt of tremendous gratitude.
I wonder, would I be out of line if I asked you to come back into government... work for the State Department?
Out of the question, sir.
I've got a stack of papers to grade.
The money involved would be substantial.
You'd be surprised how much a good teacher can earn.
Oh, gosh, I know.
And I am working on it, but it's for next term.
Before I go, sir, there is a small favor I'd like to ask.
Welcome to Larry King Live.
Tonight we seek closure in the matter of Leland Perkins... indicted on six counts of high treason.
Joining us tonight is CIA Section Chief Walter Hodge.
He's in Langley, Virginia.
At our studios in New York City... intelligence analyst
Jack E. Wadsworth.
And in our studios here tonight is Pittsburgh native Mitchell Henessey... who, at a surprise press conference... was singled out by the president of the United States... for his role in this affair.
As the expression goes, "That ain't hay."
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you, Mr. K, for having me.
Mitch, you have had one hell of a Christmas Eve... and we have heard from our reporter Carla
Krebs, on the scene in Niagara Falls... when she heard this story, she didn't believe it.
Well, what Carla failed to realize,
Mr. King... is that I'm always frank and earnest with women.
In New York, I'm Frank.
In Chicago, I'm Earnest.
Good boy.
Yeah, I could just sit out here forever.
Couldn't you?
We got cenizo...
...that's purple sage...
...agave, nopal...
What's that stuff?
That's whatchamacallit.
That's horse crippler.
This place is a gold mine.
Lead mine.
What?
I said it's a lead mine.
- Right.
- Why am I talking to you?
You got that thing on your head.
You find lots of cactus and shit?
Not just cactus. There's acacias...
...the yuccas...
- Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Man knows 150 varieties of beer, can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Cliff!
You live in a place, you should learn about it.
- Explore.
- You've got to look at this.
Don't tell me.
Spanish treasure, right?
Pieces of eight...
...from the Coronado Expedition.
Jesus!
Was Coronado in the Masons?
The forensics fella's coming down from San Marcos.
There's no way to know how old the body is without lab work.
That ring?
Mason's been around a long while.
He a treasure hunter?
Old bullets.
Makes art out of them.
Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything.
He can't hear with that rig on.
Mikey!
Hey, what have we got here?
We're supposed to leave everything where we found it.
They're real particular about that.
The scene of the crime.
No telling yet if there's been a crime...
...but this country's seen a good number of disagreements over the years.
He went to school on the post when we were in Korea.
It's all kids in the same boat, army brats...
His record shows he's a good student.
I'm more worried about the social thing.
Are there, like, gangs or guns...
We haven't had any serious violence, if that's what you mean.
But we've got a pretty lively mix.
Mexican kids...
...anglo kids, black kids.
- And the blacks are what?
- The smallest group.
Except for a couple...
...of Kickapoo kids.
Look, you're obviously a concerned parent.
Chet has no history of getting into trouble.
Pilar...
Is Amado okay?
He's not here?
Is he sick?
He's going to wish he was dead.
Somebody hand me a CD player.
They've come a long way since those old eight-tracks, ain't they?
Something wrong?
Stolen property. I'm hauling the bunch of you to jail.
If anything else is wrong, tell me on the way to the station.
Cleaning his toenails with a pocketknife.
He was the most hygienic of all the McHenry's.
"Fishbait," Buddy says, in that quiet way of his...
..."what do you know about the tires that went missing from Merkel's?"
Fishbait thinks for a minute...
...then lifts up a loose board from the porch floor...
...and calls down into it.
"Come on out, Hooter, they caught us!"
Buddy Deeds, he had a way.
He'd known who it was from the tire tracks in the dirt...
...leading from the back of the garage to where they loaded up.
"Old Fishbait," he said...
..."never lifted a thing, if there was a way he could roll it. "
Never be another like him.
You know that boy of his can't cut it.
He's all hat and no cattle.
Hey, fellas.
We was telling a few on your old man.
He was a unique individual.
He was that.
Big day coming up.
I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living.
Went so unexpected.
Better late than never.
Korean War hero, sheriff for nearly 30 years...
The Buddy Deeds Memorial Courthouse.
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
Well, the usual troublemakers.
Danny Padilla from the Sentinel.
That crowd.
We call everything else in the country after Martin Luther King.
We can't have one measly courthouse?
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton.
Bad enough that all the street names are in Spanish.
They were here first.
Then let's call it after Big Chief
Shit-In-The-Bucket. That Tonkawa had...
...the Mexes beat by centuries.
Nineteen out of 20 people here are Mexican.
There was a faction pulling for that boy killed in the Gulf War...
Yeah. Santiago.
Mexicans that know remember what...
...Buddy was for their people.
Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung...
...the deciding vote for him.
She made it an even 3-3.
As mayor, I get to cast the tiebreaker.
The old-timers won't have a problem.
They know how Buddy come to be sheriff.
Tell that story, Hollis.
Everybody heard it a million times.
I'd like to hear it.
Your version of it.
Yeah, come on, Hollis.
Well, the two of us...
...were the only deputies back then.
Me and Buddy, in what, '58?
'57, I think.
The sheriff at the time was big Charlie Wade.
Charlie...
...was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of sheriffs.
He took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this country.
It was in here one night...
...back when Jimmy Herrera run the place.
Started over a basket of tortillas.
This beaner fare doesn't agree with me but the price sure is right.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of them relatives.
Those people breed like chickens.
So?
I roust some muchacho on the street with no papers, all he's got to say is:
I work for Jimmy Herrera.
Sort of a...
...I- scratch-his-back-he-washes-mine arrangement, if you know what I mean.
This'll be one of your pickups.
First of the month, like the rent.
Get the car, Hollis.
I'm not doing it.
Come again?
It's your deal.
There's going to be some left over for you.
I take care of my boys.
That's not the point, Charlie.
You feeling bad about Jimmy?
Ask him how big a mordida they took when he run a place on the other side.
Those old boys from Ciudad León...
I'm not picking it up.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
How about this, Charlie?
How about you lay that shield on this table and vanish...
...before you end up dead...
...or in jail?
You're not making sense, Buddy.
Stick around and I'm bringing up charges on the county road project.
Two-thirds of that money went straight into your pocket.
You're being mighty careless with your mouth, son.
You ever shoot a man who's looking you in the eye?
It's a whole different story, isn't it?
You're fired.
Not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit.
Make yourself scarce and you'll make a lot of people happy.
- You little piss ant.
- Now...
...or later.
You won't have any trouble finding me.
You're a dead man.
Get the goddamn car.
We're going to Roderick's.
Boy...
...another beer, please.
Yeah, that Buddy was a cool breeze.
Wade was known to put quite a few people in the ground...
...and your daddy gets eyeball-to-eyeball with him.
We made our pickup at Roderick's place.
Nobody's seen hide nor hair of him since.
He went missing the next day along with $10,000 in county funds from the safe.
Never heard from him again.
Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn well backed it up.
Never be another like him.
So, I suppose then he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's people and...
...sent them back to the other side?
He came to an accommodation.
Money doesn't always have to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
I know you had problems with your father.
- And he and Muriel...
- Your mother was a saint.
But Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Won't be another like him.
It is an honor for me...
...to assume command of this unit.
I look forward to working with all of you.
I'm sure you're all aware of the Army's decision...
...to shut this post down.
That doesn't mean, however, that we're here to mark time...
...until we're reassigned.
You may have heard rumors...
...that I run a very tight operation.
These rumors...
...are not exaggerated.
Somebody call a doctor!
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
No, no, sir.
Go out the back way.
Somebody call a doctor!
Tearing everything down.
Our heritage, the memory of the people who fought and died for this land.
We fought and died for this land too.
We fought the U.S. Army, the Texas Rangers...
Yeah, and you lost.
Winners get the bragging rights.
People. It'd be best if we don't view this in terms of winners and losers.
The way she teaches, she's got everything backward.
I was on the textbook committee.
Her version...
We think of the textbook...
...as a guide, not as an absolute.
It is not what we set as the standard.
Now, you people can believe whatever you want...
...but when it comes to teaching...
They're our children too. As the majority in this community, we have the right.
The men who founded this state have the right to have their story told.
The men who founded this state broke from Mexico.
They needed slavery to be legal to make a fortune in the cotton business.
I think that's a bit of an oversimplification.
- You reporting or running this meeting?
- Adding some historical perspective.
You call it history, I call it propaganda.
I'm sure they've got their own account of the Alamo on the other side...
...but our schools shouldn't teach it that way.
Excuse me.
I've only been trying to get across part of the complexity of our situation here.
Cultures coming together in both negative and positive ways.
If you mean food and music and all,
I have no problem.
But when you start changing...
...who did what to who...
We're just trying to present a more complete picture.
That's what's got to stop!
There's enough ignorance in the world without us encouraging it in school.
Now, who are you calling ignorant?
I hope the sucker dies.
Mess with me, that's what you get.
Hospital says the kid is in bad shape.
The shooter local?
Houston. I think he knew the girl from before.
We'll take a statement from the GI's before they go back to post.
You can get the story from Otis.
Any poop on the John Doe we found today?
No, nothing much.
Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it.
I'll catch you later.
He's only 15. He's about 5 foot 5...
Pilar.
Something wrong?
They've got my son.
Here?
Somebody called about a house that was broken into. They say they don't have...
All right, I know what he looks like.
I'll see what's going on.
I was...
I was real sorry about Nando.
He was a good fella.
We haven't talked...
We haven't talked since high school.
I'll go check on your boy.
Ritchie didn't say nothing,
'cause he didn't want to get in it.
Then, next thing I know there's shots and Ritchie's down.
You got some boys you run in earlier?
They tell me you're good at fixing things.
Your father was a hell of a mechanic.
You know, if you figure minimum wage...
...on the time most thieves spend in jail...
...they could have bought most everything they stole.
They asked me to hook it up for them.
I didn't steal anything.
Well, I didn't say you did.
My name's Sam, by the way.
- He's all yours.
- Are you okay?
What's the big deal?
You'll find out when I get you home.
Thanks, Sam.
It's no problem.
It was good seeing you again.
Big O's is the only place where African American soldiers...
...feel comfortable, sir.
- Have we had trouble there before?
- Fistfight now and then.
- This town isn't much.
- They didn't come for a vacation.
For many, it's their first time away from home, dealing with new people...
- I remember my first hitch...
- Substance abuse?
Yes, sir, but I went through the program.
I haven't drunk...
I meant on the post.
How are you dealing with it?
We throw a urine test at them once a month.
Random numbers...
...maybe 100 people at a time.
- Let's make it once a week for a while.
- Yes, sir.
I sprint the last quarter mile.
You don't have to keep up.
Appreciate it, sir.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Sam the Man.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
So, how's business?
Business is booming.
Got your drugs, got your illegals.
Had a shooting the other night at O's place. Soldier got ventilated.
I hear they're closing Fort McKenzie.
It'll pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
We'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweat shops.
Is that the word on our boy?
This is Skinny.
Skinny?
When we find a body, it's Skinny or Stinky.
Depends on how much meat's left on the bones.
That's a nice job.
"A male Caucasian...
"... 40 to 60 years old...
"... 5 foot 9...
"... 5 foot 11.
"Chewed tobacco. "
Then we'll get the dental records and personal effects.
It's Charlie Wade.
That badge...
Didn't come out of a cereal box.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You got a cause of death?
Skull was intact.
No signs of trauma on what we found.
Not much to go on.
So, he could have gone out to the post, just hopped the fence...
...dug into the dirt on the rifle range...
...and had a heart attack.
You remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Colt Peacemaker.
He swore by it.
What?
I was just wondering.
Is Buddy on your short list?
If it were some poor majadero who swam across, got lost in the brush...
...and starved out there it wouldn't go much further, but...
...this is a once prominent citizen who disappeared.
You've got to investigate.
There's no question about it.
I'll keep names out of it until we get some answers or hit a dead end.
You know how the press is when they get ahold of a murder story, even 40 years old.
Yeah, yeah. They can do a number on you.
I remember...
...Charlie Wade come to my father's hardware store once.
I was just a little boy.
I'd heard stories about how he shot this one...
...how he shot that one.
The man winked at me.
I peed my pants.
Winked at me.
We have the fight against the Spanish, a bloody conflict for dozens of years...
...till they are finally defeated in 1821...
...and Mexican independence is declared.
Anglo settlers are invited to colonize the area.
By the time they begin the movement against Santa Anna...
...they outnumber the Mexicans here by four to one.
The war between Mexico and the anglo forces ends...
...in 1836...
...with the formation of the Texas republic. Texas...
...joins the United States...
...as a state where slavery is legal in 1845...
...after the so-called Mexican War, then secedes to join...
...the Confederacy in 1861.
The Confederacy is beaten...
...and the Reformation period here is marked by range wars...
...and race wars and all this...
...paralleled by the constant battles...
...between the Mexican and anglo settlers...
...and the various Indian nations.
What are we seeing here, Chet?
Everybody's killing everybody else?
I always wondered what you mayors do...
...when you're not cutting ribbons.
Sam!
Partner.
You caught me playing hooky.
Floating around out here, playing hell with them bass.
Sounds great! Where do I sign up?
You been by your old place lately?
No.
New people painted it some awful color.
We found a body out by Fort McKenzie yesterday.
It'd been there a long time.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
You recall if Charlie Wade was a Mason?
Charlie?
I believe he used to go for Lodge meetings over to Laredo.
What's Charlie Wade got to do with your body?
All he was wearing was a big old Masonic ring...
...and a Rio County sheriff's badge.
You remember anything else from the last night you saw him?
I told the story enough times.
We were in the car. He was stewing about his fight with Buddy as we drove over...
...to Roderick Bledsoe's.
Bledsoe?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Otis.
He's still living?
No.
I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.
You think it was Charlie Wade, huh?
Forensics people are sure of it.
You got any idea who might have put him there?
Besides my father, I mean.
There's no call for that, Sam.
Wade made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
- Buddy was one of them.
- The dedication's tomorrow.
It's a hell of a time to bring up old business.
People have made this whole big thing around my father. If it's built on a crime...
...they deserve to know.
I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
I understand why you might want to think he could.
Thanks for your time, Hollis.
Look at all this.
Tackle, boat...
All just to catch a little old fish...
...minding his own business down at the bottom of the lake.
Hardly seems worth the effort, does it, Sam?
You knew this young man before?
From back in Houston.
We both come up off the street.
Did you know he'd be there last night?
If I had, I wouldn't have gone in.
And you and Private Graves were...
We were just dancing.
We're not running a dating service.
I know that, Sergeant.
We were just dancing.
There was a bunch of us there.
Shadow... just come down looking for trouble.
I don't like to get involved with soldiers' personal lives...
...but when it interferes with training...
Shadow just gets crazy.
Sergeant, how is Ritchie doing?
Private Graves?
He'll live.
He'll be transferred to Fort Sam...
...as soon as he's stabilized.
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge.
Will this go on my record?
The incident will be noted.
If it happened the way you say...
...there hasn't been an infraction.
Thank you, Sergeant.
You're dismissed.
Thank you, Sergeant.
You spoil them, Cliff.
- You don't believe her?
- That wasn't much of an interrogation.
I'm in charge of her sorry ass and frankly...
I won't give her the third-degree because her ex-boyfriend's a thug.
She's pulled herself out of a rough neighborhood.
And if she isn't careful, she's gonna slide right back into it.
Mrs. Bledsoe?
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds.
Sheriff Deeds is dead, honey.
You're just Sheriff Junior.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You ever play one of these?
Yeah, I've seen them.
Don't ever start up on them, because...
...once you do, you can't stop.
I tell myself I'll just play three little games after breakfast...
...and here I am...
...with half the day gone.
May I ask you a few questions about your husband?
Roderick.
I ain't gonna say nothing bad about the man...
...but you can ask away.
He had the club on Old Trail Road.
We run that club for over 20 years.
Give it over to Otis Payne...
...in 1967, April.
You must remember Sheriff Wade.
Them days...
...you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal.
First of the month, every month...
...he'd remind you who you really working for.
So, he squeezed money out of you?
It wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then, unless you was a club, see?
Roderick used to say:
"Buy yourself a glass, get a free membership. "
Sheriff Wade...
...he could close you down anytime.
And my father?
Sheriff Buddy was a different story.
As long as Roderick throw his weight the right way at election day...
...make sure all the colored come to vote, throw a barbecue for the right folks...
Sheriff Buddy kept to his word.
That Sheriff Wade, though...
...he could get ugly.
People didn't complain?
Not if you was colored or Mexican.
Not if you wanted to keep breathing.
I remember the last time I seen him before he gone missing.
He come fussing around our place.
He used to come in whilst we was in full swing.
Making everybody nervous.
Had him a smile like the Grim Reaper.
He used to sit there with his hand on his old gun...
...acting the kingfish with everybody.
Otis Payne come...
...to work for us about that time...
...and that boy had him some attitude.
Pour it.
What?
Pour it.
I know you?
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
Payne.
They call me "O."
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I sent your daddy to the farm once.
Yeah, I know that.
Why you think that was?
Some crop needed picking and the man was short-handed.
As I remember, it was 'cause he had a sassy mouth on him.
Must run in the family.
You wouldn't be running numbers out of this club?
Running numbers is illegal, sir.
Running numbers without I knowin' about it is both illegal and unhealthy.
You remember that.
Son, you're not finished.
Pour his.
I prefer it in the bottle.
Shut up, Hollis.
How come you don't look familiar?
I've been away, up in Houston.
Houston?
I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
Look what you've done now.
Better get something to wipe it up, son.
You spilled it.
Maybe you should wipe it up.
I told you to do something. Will you hop to it or will we have a problem?
You don't want to turn tail in front of your people?
I understand.
Come on, Houston, give it a try.
Come to Papa.
Don't mind him.
He's a bit slow, is all.
He don't mean nothing by it.
That the problem, son?
You slow?
Otis!
Apologize to the sheriff.
Sheriff, you got him too scared to peep.
Maybe if you'd put that gun up.
You telling me what to do?
No, Sheriff, I'm just...
Is that whisky in them glasses?
I'll have to cite you for violation of a state law.
This is a club, Sheriff. You've been here.
You people better clear out of here now!
Learn how to act your place, son.
This isn't Houston.
'Course, I was young...
...and full of beans back then.
I didn't understand the spot
I was putting Roderick in.
And that was the last time you saw him?
I think he came in one more time...
...with Hollis and...
No, no, your daddy wasn't with him.
Made their monthly pickup.
Roderick wasn't in, so I kept my mouth shut and handed over that envelope.
That was the night he disappeared?
Could have been.
You own a gun?
Back then?
No.
How about Roderick?
Oh, he kept...
...a big old piece back behind the bar, just so folks knew it was there.
I don't keep one here now.
Don't much care for them.
And when my father was sheriff?
What about him?
What was your deal with him?
Buddy was more part of the big picture:
County political machine...
...Chamber of Commerce, Zoning Board...
If I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.
When somebody thought of starting up a new bar for the black folks, they'd be...
How should I say this?
They'd be officially discouraged.
He ever accept cash for a favor?
I don't recall a prisoner ever died...
...in your daddy's custody.
I don't recall a man in this county...
...black, white, Mexican...
...who'd hesitate for a minute...
...before they'd call on Buddy Deeds to solve a problem.
More than that...
...I wouldn't care to say.
I'm supposed to tell my friends they're too low-class to hang with?
Come on, Amado.
- 'Cause I'm not like Miss Honor Roll?
- Leave your sister out of it.
You and those teachers in that dump...
Your story's over, so nobody can have fun.
You jerk.
You have no friends.
Who'd be friends with a pachuco wannabe?
- I don't pretend I came on the Mayflower.
- And those stupid girls.
Shut up.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's in love with Santo Guerra.
So?
You can't be desperately in love when you're 14.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Of course, you can.
What?
It's got nothing to do with being smart.
It's ancient goddamn history, Danny.
1963, they dam up the north branch to make Lake Pescadero...
...and a whole town disappears.
A squatter's town!
People lived in Perdido for over 100 years!
Mexicans and Chicanos are deported...
...forcibly evicted by our local hero,
Buddy Deeds, and his department.
There was a bill from the state legislature.
Families were split apart!
A whole community was destroyed!
And who gets Lakefront property bought for a fraction of the market price?
Buddy Deeds, Sheriff of Rio County, and his Chief Deputy, Hollis Pogue.
Are you finished?
Look, I'm not after you, Sam.
I just think people ought to know the full story on Buddy Deeds.
That makes two of us.
What's the big deal? Go back over, talk to the man, and bury the hatchet.
Why me? He's had almost 40 years and I haven't heard from him.
He was probably embarrassed.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
You were 8 when he left.
He moved three houses down with my mother's best friend.
Dad.
"Delmore, where's your daddy?"
Godforsaken town.
Everybody in everybody else's business.
Everybody loved Otis. Big "O."
Always there with a smile or a loan...
...or a free drink.
- Dad, can I talk to you about track?
People change.
Not that much.
I talked to the coach.
I told you. Next year, if your grades are high.
I have a B average!
How many B students do you think they take at West Point?
We'll be here for three years.
We'll have to see him.
No, we don't.
Get off the phone.
We've got a big wedding.
Mommy...
They are getting stupider every year.
Maybe you're getting less patient.
If they're going to survive, they have to know how to work.
You hire illegals, what do you expect?
Nobody's illegal in my cafe!
They've got green cards, relatives who were born here.
If they only had a little common sense,
I'd be happy.
If you took more time training them, you wouldn't have to...
Did you come here to teach me how to run my business?
Do you want to take a trip...
...down south with us?
Maybe see where you grew up?
- Why would I want to go there?
- You must be curious...
...how it's changed. Amado is into this big tejano- roots thing...
...and I've never been further than Ciudad León.
You want to see Mexicans?
Open your eyes and look around you.
We're up to our ears in them.
Mommy...
...how old were you when my father died?
He was killed.
Right, when he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
How come you never remarried?
It just didn't happen.
There must have been...
...somebody.
I was too busy.
Nobody is too busy.
Maybe now.
It was different back then.
I had to do all the shopping, all the cooking...
What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Thank you.
I don't mean Fernando.
When I brought him home, those were your exact words:
"A chulo with grease under his nails. "
I never said that.
You made it pretty damn clear.
You thought he was nobody.
I thought you could do better.
What? What?
Become a nun? You didn't even want me to go out with anglos.
I never said that. Just that boy.
"That boy. "
Say his name, for Christ's sake.
You people are stealing from me.
Is she your mother?
I'm sorry.
Now, I'm as liberal as the next guy.
If the next guy is a redneck.
But I got to say...
...I think there's something to this cold-climate business.
I mean, you go to the beach...
...what do you do?
Drink a few beers, wait for that fish to flop up on the sand.
You can't build no civilization that way.
But you got a cold winter coming on...
...you got to plan ahead.
That gives your old cerebral cortex a workout.
Good thing you were born down here then.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis.
The lines of demarcation are getting fuzzy.
To run a successful civilization, you've got to have your lines of demarcation...
...between right and wrong, this one and that one.
Your daddy understood that.
He was... What do you call it?
The referee in this damn menudo we got down here.
He understood how most folks don't want their salt and sugar in the same jar.
If you mixed drinks...
...as bad as you mix metaphors...
...you'd be out of a job.
You're the last white sheriff this town will see.
Hollis retires next year.
Jorge Guerra will take over.
This is it, right here, Sam.
This bar is the last stand.
Se habla American, goddamn it!
And even in here, it's sliding away.
Take that pair over there in the corner.
A place like this, 20 years ago...
...Buddy'd been on them.
He'd have went over there...
...and given them a warning.
Not that he had it in for the colored, but just as a kind of a safety tip.
Yeah, bet he would.
The day that man died...
...they broke the goddamn mold.
- Seriously.
- Seriously?
I think we should get married.
We've been through this before.
We should just do it.
And if I get transferred to another post?
Germany or Korea?
I'd ask for a transfer too.
Which they'd most likely turn down.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
You know, you are something.
Man's going to retire in two years and he offers to quit.
Big goddamn deal.
Excuse me.
Sheriff.
This is Sergeant...
This is Priscilla Worth.
Sheriff Deeds was with us on our archeological find.
They're building a shopping mall there?
If certain people have their way, it's gonna be a new jail.
They're closing down military and putting up jails...
...like 7-11 stores.
Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site...
...as a rifle range?
Fort McKenzie stopped training infantry...
...there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits...
...till they gave it to the county last year.
You know who it was they dug up?
Not for sure yet.
But I kind of wish they hadn't.
In English, Enrique.
This is the United States.
We speak English.
Is very beautiful, your car.
- Good night, Enrique.
- Buenas noches, seòora.
Carolyn...
Knock that off.
Black Seminoles?
Hobby of mine.
A few artifacts...
...couple of pieces one of your men out on the base made.
Admission's free.
This is where he was shot?
He fell right by the door.
You get much of that here?
It's a bar.
Folks come together...
...drink, fall in love, fall out of love...
...hear their grudges out.
Deal drugs in the bathroom.
If I thought it would do any good...
...I'd put up a sign telling them not to...
...right next to the one about the employees washing their hands.
This here is Carolyn.
Honey...
...this is my son, Delmore.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
I'll be in the back waiting for that delivery.
So?
So.
Tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
This is an official visit then.
I assume most of your business is with our people.
Your boys are cooped up together.
They need a place to let the steam out.
If they're black, there's not but one spot in this county...
...where they feel welcome.
It's been that way...
...since before you were born.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
You the man out there now, ain't you?
It's your call.
That's right.
I've been hearing about this new command out there...
...for a couple of weeks now.
The boys say they hear he's a hard case...
...a real spit-and-polish man.
Full bird colonel by the name of Payne.
Bet you never figured you'd end up back here.
When the Army offers you a command, you go...
...wherever it is.
Right.
I hear things too.
They call you...
...the mayor of Darktown.
Over the years this is the one place that's always been there.
I loan a little money out,
I've settled a few arguments.
I got a cot in the back. Folks get scared to go home, they spend the night.
There's not enough of us to run anything in this town.
It's the Holiness Church...
...or Big O's.
And the people make a choice.
Most of them choose both.
It's not like there's a borderline...
...between the good people and the bad people.
You're not on either...
...one side or the other.
Right.
Will I meet that family of yours?
Why would you want to do that?
Because I'm your father.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision.
So, that's him.
Yeah, that's him.
Historic occasion, ain't it?
Seems like we have another one every week.
Jorge and the boys down at the Chamber of Commerce got to keep things humming.
Building up tourism, Sam.
Most people come here to catch bass and get laid at the Boy's Town in Ciudad León.
You ought to put up a banner, "Frontera,
Texas - Gateway to Inexpensive Pussy. "
That kind of talk doesn't help.
I'd rather have that than a 10-foot-high catfish statue.
Eddie Richter at the Sentinel will kill that story.
The Perdido thing?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news.
Danny will be out for blood the next time.
That's why we need to talk to you about the new jail.
Come on, we don't need a new jail.
That's a matter of opinion.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow.
It wouldn't be your construction company who'd get the bid on building this thing?
And, Jorge...
You wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs...
...to dangle by the voters when you run for mayor next election?
Damn it, Sam! The people are concerned about crime.
I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here.
But if anybody asks...
...I've got to tell them the truth.
We don't need a new jail.
We backed you...
When you backed me, you needed somebody named Deeds...
...to bump the other fella out of office.
- Hey, folks.
- Fenton, what's up, buddy?
- How you doing?
- Let's get this thing over with.
I never thought I'd see a buddy of mine dating a woman...
...with three bars on her shoulder.
It's beyond what you'd call dating.
You're going to get married?
Maybe.
You met her family?
They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Priscilla says they think a woman over 30 who's not married must be a lesbian.
She figures they'll be so relieved
I'm a man...
It's always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.
But marriage, man, I don't know.
Let's see...
I did two tours of duty in Southeast Asia...
...and I was married for five years.
I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
Mikey?
I knew she was Japanese, but she didn't tell me...
...the Ninja-assassin part.
Parents acted like I'd blow my nose on their curtains.
If I stayed out past 10:00, she'd do a Madam Butterfly routine.
Mikey, look at this.
What?
It's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets.
It's a. 45.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right?
- Rest of this is all. 30 caliber.
- They used M-1s.
So what's a pistol slug doing on a rifle range?
We'd better call that sheriff.
Back in the early '70s...
...a reporter from a national magazine asked the governor of our Lone Star state:
"Governor...
"... what's your ideal...
"... of what a real Texan ought to be?"
Governor said:
"Son, that's easy.
"Just go down to...
"... Rio County and look at...
"... Sheriff Buddy Deeds. "
Thank you.
There's...
...one more person we ought to hear from and...
...I think he's somebody that knew Buddy better than any of us.
Sam...
Say a few words?
Well, you folks who remember my father...
...knew him as sheriff.
But at home he was also judge, jury...
...and executioner.
This is a real honor you're doing him today.
If Buddy was around, I know his hat size would be getting bigger every minute.
I used to think there wasn't a place here you could hide from my old man.
And now I'm sure of it.
I do appreciate it, though.
And wherever he is, Buddy's putting the beer on ice for you. So, thank you.
And now, my favorite council member...
...and one of Frontera's most respected businesswomen...
...Mrs. Mercedes Cruz...
...will do the honors.
It does look kind of like Buddy.
I think he'll run that Mexican kid in for loitering.
Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.
Field trip?
Lunch hour.
My next class isn't until 1:30.
You want to take a walk?
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
People liked him.
Most people did, yeah.
I remember him watching me once...
...when I was little...
...before you and I...
I was in the playground with all the other kids.
I thought he was only looking at me.
I was afraid he was going to arrest me.
He had those eyes, and that...
Yeah.
It's weird what you remember.
Your boy there.
Amado.
Nice looking kid.
He hates me.
No.
With Paloma, it's like she pities and tolerates me, totally age-appropriate.
But with Amado...
...you know, he's always had difficulty reading and me...
...being a teacher and caring about those things, it's like a betrayal.
But Fernando did okay.
He dropped out.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody.
He just wanted to fix their cars.
I spent my first 15 years trying to be just like Buddy.
The next 15 trying to give him a heart attack.
So, why did you come back here, Sam?
I got divorced...
...and I wouldn't work for my father-in-law anymore.
And the fellas down here...
...they said they'd back me.
You don't want to be sheriff.
I got to admit, it's not what I thought it'd be.
Back when Buddy had it...
Hell, I'm just a jailer.
Run a 60-room hotel with bars on the windows.
Do you remember this?
I ought to head back.
It looks real bad if a teacher's late for class.
It's real nice to talk with you, Sam.
Are you going to tell her?
Are you going to tell him?
He doesn't need to know my business.
He's going to find out.
What is he going to do, arrest us?
It's supposed to be a big sin even if you love each other.
Do you believe that?
No.
Me neither.
Private Johnson!
Report to the sergeant in the orderly's room.
The doctor will have a look at you.
No, I'm feeling okay.
I'm happy to hear it.
You go put some pee-pee in the cup for Dr. Innis and I'll feel okay too.
You testing me?
You and 119 other fortunate individuals.
Put it in gear.
- Take this shit off now.
- You've been talking so much trash today!
You better be good, boy.
"Boy"? You're the good boy.
The man say "fetch" and you fetch.
Just doing my job.
White man's using you to keep the black man down.
This isn't Houston. We run things now.
Our good day has come.
You chumps haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
Lupe...
Can you get me Ben Wetzel up in Austin?
Wetbacks again.
Border Patrol?
Mom?
Yeah.
You staying out here?
For a while.
What's she singing about?
What do you think?
Hey, 'morning, sir!
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
Three months.
Stop growing that locoweed at your place, you'd see more daylight.
It was for personal consumption.
You going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I got a bad stomach. It helps me to digest.
Your father never bothered me about it.
Leastways not till the drug people got on his case in the late '60s.
I thought he busted you a couple of times.
No.
Different charge.
I had a still.
Made my own mescal.
That's how come I ruined my stomach.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
He was afraid I'd poison somebody.
Your father tried to do good for people.
- So I've heard.
- And your mother...
...she was a saint.
Remember that summer I built that patio at your house?
She made me lunch every day.
You were working there.
It could have been another box lunch from the jail.
So you built our patio while you were on the county?
Out in the fresh air?
Nice gringo lady making you pies?
Who'd sit in that jail cell all day?
Sheriff Buddy, man.
There's no one like him.
After that cabrón, Charlie Wade.
I heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans.
He murdered Eladio Cruz.
Is that tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes.
Shot him in cold blood.
Charlie Wade was a big asshole.
Sam...
Wait up.
You're out early.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
Well, I'm working on a few things.
I'm going over to the other side.
Republicans?
No, Mexico.
Got to talk to someone.
They got telephones.
No.
It's got to be in person.
The Committee...
Jorge and Fenton and all, they...
...they've asked me-
They want you to stand for sheriff next election.
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
Thanks.
What about you?
I don't know if I'll still want it.
I just didn't want to go around your back.
I appreciate you telling me.
You think we need a new jail?
Well, Sam...
It's a complicated issue.
Yeah, Ray.
You'd be a hell of a sheriff.
Down here...
...we don't throw everything away like you gringos do.
Recycling, right?
We invented that.
The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
You own this place, huh?
This place...
...the one across the street...
...three or four others in Ciudad León.
"King of the Tires. "
A lot of your people rolling over that bridge on my rubber.
You lived in the States for a while?
Fifteen years.
Made some money, came back here?
Something like that.
Hey, you ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
You're the sheriff of Rio County, right?
Step across this line.
You're not the sheriff of nothing anymore.
Just some tejano with a lot of questions
I don't have to answer.
A bird flying south...
...you think he sees this line?
Rattlesnake,jabalina...
...whatever you got.
You think halfway across that line they start thinking different?
Why should a man?
Your government's been pretty happy to have that line.
The question's just been where to draw it.
My government can go fuck itself and so can yours.
I'm talking about people here.
Men.
Eladio Cruz...
...is giving his friends a lift one day in his camión.
But since they're on one side of this invisible line and not the other...
...they got to hide in the back como criminales.
And because over there he's just another Mex bracero...
...any man with a badge is his jefe.
What's in the back?
Not much,jefe. Some watermelons.
I'm driving them up to the market.
They could bring a good price.
I heard somebody's been hauling wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
That person's been bragging all over the county...
...how he doesn't have to cut that gringo sheriff in on it.
Run his own operation without any help.
What's your name?
Eladio Cruz.
You know this road's got a bad reputation.
Reputation?
Bandidos, Injuns.
Many an unfortunate soul has been ambushed out on this stretch.
I hope you're carrying some protection.
Protection?
You carrying a firearm, son?
Don't lie to me now.
Just a shotgun.
Just a shotgun.
Then let me have a look at that.
Little greaser son of a bitch is running a goddamn bus service.
Thinks he can make a fool out of Charlie Wade.
Get them wets out of the back.
See what we've got.
You killed him!
You got a talent for stating the obvious, son.
Steve called for you.
Steve?
Steve. Board of Education Steve, who likes you.
He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls,
I can tell.
Spanish. My mother would have a heart attack.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
They go back to Cortés.
When he was riding by they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
You've got to be interested in somebody.
All you do is work.
All my mother does is work.
It's how you get to be Spanish.
How about this sheriff?
Sheriff?
The old high-school heartthrob sheriff?
I thought you were crazy about each other.
He's available. You're available.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
You told me one time it was true love.
Nobody stays in love for 23 years.
Let's go.
Goddamn it.
Come here. Come on.
- What the hell are you doing, asshole?
- How old is that girl?
Get your clothes in order, missy.
Where's your goddamn sense?
You got no fucking right!
Stay out of my life!
Give me the goddamn car keys.
What should I do with her?
Drive her home. Tell her mother where we found her.
- Leave her alone!
- Move it, boy!
Don't tell my mother. She'll kill me.
Pilar!
Don't eye me.
Git!
Follow me.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
Yeah.
And I look at my kids in school...
...10th, 11th-graders.
That's who we were. Children.
I mean, what did we know about anything?
Nothing.
When Nando died...
...it was so sudden...
...I kind of went into shock for a while...
...and then I woke up and...
...there was the rest of my life and I had no idea what to do with it.
You know, the other day you asked...
...why I came back.
Yeah?
I came back 'cause you were here.
My mother hasn't changed a song since I was 10.
How come it feels the same?
I don't know.
It just feels good.
Always did.
So...
What are we going to do about this?
More...
...I hope.
How long have you lived here?
Two years.
There's nothing on the walls.
No pictures.
I don't have kids.
Other pictures...
I don't know. It's nothing I want to look back on.
Like your story's over.
I've felt that way...
...yeah.
It isn't.
Not by a long shot.
Pilar...
What was your father's name?
Eladio.
Eladio Cruz.
That's John Horse.
The Spanish down in Florida call him...
..."Juan Caballo. "
John Horse.
He a black man or an Indian?
Both.
He was part of the Seminole nation.
Got pushed down into the Florida
Everglades back in pioneer days.
African people run off from slaveholders...
...hooked up with them...
...married up, had children.
When the Spanish gave up Florida...
...the U.S. Army come down to move all the Indian people to Oklahoma.
A couple of them held out.
That man, John Horse...
...his friend, Wildcat, another fella named...
...Osceola...
...formed a fighting band...
...held out for another 10, 15 years...
...and beat Zach Taylor and 1,000 troops at Lake Okeechobee.
So they stayed in Florida?
One night they packed up, rode out to Mexico.
Men went to work for General Santa Anna down there.
After the Civil War they came north to Texas, put up at Fort Duncan...
...and the men joined what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts.
The best trackers...
...on either side of the border.
They chased after bandits...
...rustlers, Texas rednecks,
Kiowas, Comanches...
They fought against the Indians?
Just like they did in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army...
...like your father.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Are you kidding?
And face a court-martial?
Pretty tough old man.
Every time he moves up a rank...
...he tightens the screws a little more.
Just 'cause...
You know, he didn't have...
Didn't have a father.
He's still pissed off about it.
When you're his age...
...you'll still be pissed off about him.
How come you got into this?
These are our people.
There are Paynes in Florida,
Oklahoma, Piedras Negras-
So I'm part Indian?
By blood you are.
But blood only means what you let it.
My father says from the day you're born you start from scratch.
No breaks.
No excuses.
You got to pull yourself up on your own.
He's living proof of that, son.
Living proof.
'Morning, Hollis.
Sam!
Sit down.
Big to-do the other day.
Meant a lot to folks you said something.
You thought anymore about our murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Well, I got an idea what happened.
You do?
I think somewhere between
Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house...
...Wade ran into Buddy Deeds.
I think Buddy put a bullet in him.
Waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the sheriff's car...
...and drove him out by Fort McKenzie.
I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
You lived in the man's house, how long?
17, 18 years...
...but didn't get to know him any better than that.
I got to go see somebody up in San Antonio.
Now, your memory gets any better...
...I'll be back tonight.
She finally got up.
It's Saturday.
You got in late last night.
I had some...
...some school business.
Could I get this?
Paloma.
Nobody really wears that stuff.
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
I only went for my last two years.
How come?
My mother wanted to keep me away from...
...from boys.
Did it work?
Longhorns go for 10 times the price.
But longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Sell much out here?
How am I going to sell things?
Nobody comes around.
This stretch of road...
...runs between Nowhere and...
...Not Much Else.
A hell of a spot to put a business.
Don't see much competition, do you?
Used to sell these things like hotcakes.
Now...
...if it can't play those disks, they won't look at it.
I like it here.
Once I tried going onto the reservation to live.
Couldn't take the politics.
Damn Indians will drive you crazy with that.
Now, your father, this wasn't what he had in mind.
He come out of Korea...
...bought a Chevy with too much engine.
Used to come roaring up and down this road all hours of the day and night...
...looking for somebody to race.
Here.
Buffalo chips.
A fella down in Santa Fe told me...
...he sells these as fast as a buffalo can squeeze them out.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
They don't hand those medals out for hiding in your foxhole.
Would you buy this?
No.
Yeah, neither would I.
If he hadn't found the deputy's job...
...I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into serious trouble.
It settled him right down.
That and your mother.
Of course, he had that other one later.
He had another woman?
Your mother was not one to be chased off her patch.
Half the damn county knew about it.
Nobody thought the worse of her for seeing it through.
You know who it was?
The other one?
At my age...
...you learn a new name...
...you got to forget an old one.
Here.
This big fella was sleeping in a crate at Cisco's junkyard.
When I was going to open to see what was in her...
...jumped right at my face.
Scared me so bad I had to kill him without thinking.
Be careful where you go poking.
Who knows what you'll find.
Private Johnson...
...are you unhappy...
...in the Army?
No, sir.
Then how would you explain...
...that out of 120 people...
...you were the only one...
...who tested positive for drugs?
I'm sorry, sir.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist...
...a kind of contract was agreed upon.
I think the Army has honored its part...
...of that agreement.
Yes, sir.
Do you believe in what we do in here, Private?
I can do the job, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is?
Follow orders, do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
The officers.
And that's the job?
Nothing about serving your country?
These are not trick questions,
Private Johnson.
You'll get an Article 15...
...and we'll go through the process one way or another.
I'm just trying to understand...
...how someone like you thinks.
You really want to know?
Please.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Being good at your job.
Doing what they tell you.
Do what they tell you?
I mean, follow orders, sir.
With your attitude, Private...
...I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
I do, sir.
Because it's a job?
Outside it's such a mess. It's...
Chaos.
Why do you think...
...they let us in on the deal?
'Cause they got people to fight:
Arabs, yellow people, whatever.
Might as well use us.
It works like this, Private.
Every soldier in the war doesn't have to believe...
...in what he's fighting for.
Most of them fight just to back up the other soldiers in their squad.
You try not to get them killed.
You try not to get them extra duty.
You try not embarrass yourself...
...in front of them.
Why don't you start with that?
Yes, sir.
Dismissed.
Thank you, sir.
This time, Fred Zenito for Pager and the Aggies jump to a 14-point lead.
Sooners back to punt on their own 27.
Longhorns are going to kick some serious butt this Saturday. You just watch.
We got a kid, a tailback from down your way, out of El Indio-
That's in Maverick County.
Right, and you're in?
In Rio.
This kid, Hosea Brown...
...he does the 40 in 3.4.
Soft hands, lateral movement, the whole package.
- Only a sophomore.
- Still go to all the home games?
Daddy's got his box in the stadium and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games.
And Friday nights there's high school.
Churchill's got this boy, 6 foot 6,
310, moves like a cat.
High school, we're talking.
Guess how much he can bench-press?
Bunny, you...
You on that same medication?
- Why, do I seem jumpy?
- No.
You look good. I was just wondering.
Last year was awful with Mama passing on and this business with O.J.
It's not Don Meredith or...
...one of our boys, but it kind of threw me for a loop.
You look good.
Then that squeaker, the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma.
That son of a bitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal.
If they hadn't pulled me off that woman,
I'd have jerked a knot in her.
Were you in a fight?
Daddy calls it an altercation.
How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
No, I'm the same weight I always was.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job.
Says so himself:
"Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now. "
Bunny...
That stuff I left in the garage still there?
Least he never called me that.
With me it was always "high-strung. "
"Bunny would've done something with her life if she wasn't so high-strung. "
Or "tightly wound. "
You haven't had one of your fires, have you?
The stuff I left in the garage, some of it was my father's.
Did you watch the draft this year?
Of course not. Idiot question.
They try to make it dramatic...
...like it's a surprise who picks who in the first round...
...but they went over it for months with their experts, computers...
...doctor's reports, coach's evaluations...
...highlight reels, psychological profiles...
I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on them, had them analyzed.
All that to pick...
...a football player for your squad.
Compared to that, what you know about a person when you get married to them...
...doesn't amount to diddly, does it?
No, I suppose not.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you?
The whole time we were seeing each other, you didn't know that I was tightly wound.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
No, it wasn't, was it?
You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul.
Your shit's still in the garage, if that's what you came for.
Three hundred and fifty pounds.
That boy Churchill's got.
He plays tackle both ways.
Bench-presses 350 pounds.
Imagine having that much weight on you, pressing down.
Be hard to breathe, hard to swallow.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest.
A spotter.
"I only got my little girl now," he says.
"She's my lifeline. "
Then he says I can't sit in the box anymore if I don't control myself.
Son of a bitch!
He doesn't even watch the games, just sits there drinking.
Looks up at the TV now and then.
I'd be better off in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You look good, Bunny.
It was nice to see you.
Thanks.
I like it when you say that, Sam.
"Dearest Buddy. "
Hey, it's the general.
Colonel. Is Otis in?
- Come on in.
- If it's too late-
Come on in.
Otis is sitting up with some people at the club. I don't think he'll be long.
His hot sauce recipe won a contest last year.
They're selling it as far away...
...as San Antonio.
You've been in this house for a while?
I've been here with him eight years.
He built it when he was with Leora.
Never met her.
There's a bunch of them you never met.
Well, me neither.
Let me show you around.
He got into this cowboys-and-Indians stuff a while back.
Spent half his time poking...
...around the library, way up to Austin.
Kind of like a shrine, isn't it?
Where did he get all this stuff?
Your mother's got a brother, Alphonse.
Uncle Al.
Otis stood on good terms with him.
Whenever you make the news...
...he sends it on.
When they made you general...
...Otis almost drove away our customers going on about it.
I'm a colonel.
I know.
The man made me memorize the whole Army chain of command...
...before he'd marry me.
My mother said that he never asked about me.
He never asked her.
Tell him I stopped by?
Thanks.
Catch you later...
...Colonel.
Seòora Cruz.
Who is it?
What are you doing out here?
Are you crazy?
In English. We're in the United States.
I have some friends and they have had an accident.
- You have somebody else out there?
- We was...
...by the river and I heard my friend calling for help...
...and I look...
...and she has fallen in the water.
Don't tell me lies. What happened?
We was crossing the river.
What are you doing out there?
Wait. Who are they?
Why bring them here?
I need help, seòora.
I'll call Border Patrol.
They'll get her to the hospital.
You think you're doing these people a favor?
What are they going to do?
They get on welfare...
...or they become criminals.
This girl is a friend of yours?
I thought you were married.
I am married to the cousin of a friend but only to live here.
This is the mother of my child.
Typical.
Homework?
I finished that.
I'm just messing around.
Tanks, huh?
Yeah, well...
If you've got to be in the Army, better to have something slick to drive.
So...
You're going in the Army?
That's the general plan, isn't it?
That's up to you.
The Army isn't for everybody.
It's not that I think you wouldn't be good at it.
You know...
I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
You wouldn't?
No.
How's your room shaping up?
It's fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Good.
Are we ever going to see your father?
My father?
He lives here, right?
Yes, he does.
Maybe we'll...
We'll fix that thing out back and have...
...a barbecue.
We could invite him and...
...and his wife over.
He makes his own sauce.
Let's go! Hurry up!
Everybody in the world will see.
He was a doctor on the other side.
Don't worry about it.
He owes me a few favors.
In English, Enrique. In English!
Hollis!
Hollis!
You in there?
Fellas.
You're open late.
I'm not open. We're just talking.
So, Hollis probably told you.
We found Charlie Wade.
Is that right?
Start digging holes in this county, no telling what'll come up.
You two saw it, didn't you?
You two saw it when Buddy killed him.
I'm going to find out one way or the other.
Your father had the finest sense of justice...
...of any man I've ever known.
And my mother was a saint.
For 15 years the whole damn town...
...knew he had another woman on the side.
He stole $10,000 and set her up in business...
...but hell, what's that?
You got a problem, old Buddy'll fix it.
You facing some time in jail?
Buddy'll knock half of it off, if you do what he says when he says.
You got some business that's not exactly legal?
Just talk to Buddy.
Buddy Deeds-
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
That night at the cafe...
...he didn't stay long after you left, did he, Hollis?
Maybe he'd decided he'd gone too far with Wade.
He figured he'd better not wait for the sheriff to get behind him.
So he stepped out to see if he could catch up...
...and you were here that night...
...weren't you, "O"?
I was here.
I'd been running a game on the side after hours.
Craps.
Draw poker on the weekends.
Roderick didn't know about it.
More important...
...Charlie Wade didn't know about it...
...'cause I didn't want to cut him in on it.
I was pretty full of myself back in those days.
Hell, I just didn't expect the man so early.
Wade!
Sheriff Charlie was the whip hand for old Judge Tibbs...
...who pretty much owned this county back then.
If the truth came out...
...he wasn't going to go easy on Hollis.
I don't know why I trusted Buddy with it...
...don't know why he trusted me.
The first time I talked with him...
...was right there and then...
...with a dead white man leaking blood on the floor between us.
The three of us cleaned up and took him out by the post...
...and put him under.
I can't say I was much help.
And the $10,000?
Widow's benefits.
He figured it'd make the disappearance look better.
And Mercedes was scraping by after Charlie killed her man.
Buddy and her...
...didn't get hooked up until later.
Time went on...
...people liked the story we told...
...better than what the truth might have been.
It's your call, Sam.
I don't think the Rangers are likely to...
...find out any more than they already know.
And as for me...
...it's just one of your unsolved mysteries.
Word gets out who the body was...
...people'll think Buddy done it.
Buddy's a goddamn legend.
He can handle it.
'Night, fellas.
When does the picture start?
Are you going to tell your mother we've been seeing each other?
She'll find out sooner or later.
I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
You have any idea when your father died?
Eladio?
Couple of months before I was born.
Try a year and half.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county.
They can't pull this on me.
It's not fair.
I don't believe this.
He paid the hospital bill when you were born.
Your mother...
...she always called you...
..."a beautiful daughter"...
...in the letters she wrote to him.
From the first time I saw you at school...
...all those years we were married to other people, I always felt...
...like we were connected.
I remember thinking...
...you were the one part of my life...
...that Buddy didn't have a piece of.
I can't have any more children.
After Amado, I had complications.
I can't get pregnant anymore, if that's what the rule is about.
So that's it?
You won't want to be with me anymore?
If I met you...
...for the first time today...
...I'd still want to be with you.
Start from scratch?
Yeah.
All that other stuff and all that history...
...the hell with it, right?
Forget the Alamo.

{505}{554}Mrs. Baran fainted! Let's go.
{629}{675}-Get a doctor!|-I'll go!
{1006}{1095}The doctor's worried about you.|He thinks it's serious.
{1101}{1138}Where's the body?
{1148}{1203}Someone moved it, that's apparent.
{1208}{1262}Someone saw us put it in?
{1284}{1338}Well, I don't know. Maybe.
{1395}{1429}We must find him.
{1440}{1466}No, Mia.
{1471}{1577}Stick to our story. It's better|this way. We don't know where he is.
{1582}{1646}He'll turn up.|If he doesn't, all the better.
{1651}{1716}Okay? Did you take your|heart medicine? No.
{1730}{1826}We must act naturally.|You must ask about Guy.
{1831}{1935}Be concerned, like you would be|if he was really missing.
{2074}{2145}-What?|-His suit.
{2321}{2360}Oh, my God.
{2828}{2910}4 x 6 color prints.|Can I have those in 20 minutes?
{3404}{3434}Ask her.
{3619}{3692}Tell her if she sees anything,|to call us.
{3916}{3946}He's disappeared.
{4394}{4459}Let's just get these|and get out of here.
{4914}{5001}Someone's watching us.|Someone with Guy's camera.
{5255}{5348}-You need to eat, honey.|-I'm not hungry, thank you.
{5353}{5392}He is dead, Mia.
{5449}{5529}He is dead. We killed him.|You saw him die.
{5623}{5659}What about the pictures?
{5664}{5736}Someone took them before he was killed.
{5770}{5821}-Right?|-Who?
{5827}{5900}We'll know when they start|blackmailing us.
{5916}{5947}He's dead.
{5952}{5994}This is another thing.
{6021}{6073}I didn't tell you something.
{6138}{6169}Open it.
{6279}{6352}It's the school accounts.|That's why there's no money.
{6358}{6476}It was for Guy and me. He told me|someone stole it, but I found it.
{6488}{6529}You killed him for money.
{6534}{6597}Believe me, it wasn't the only reason.
{6631}{6683}There's $50,000 there, Mia.
{6688}{6716}We'll split it.
{6721}{6796}Use it to pay for your damn|fried chicken.
{6830}{6874}I can go to the police.
{6888}{6947}I can tell them what we did.
{6956}{6997}What you did.
{7004}{7048}We both did it.
{7053}{7126}They won't see that as|beneficial to me.
{7131}{7227}They'll say the wife gets the|school, the money, her freedom.
{7232}{7287}What does the other woman get?
{7292}{7372}Nothing.|That's how they'll look at it.
{7519}{7570}I'll say we were lovers.
{7575}{7651}You can take the girl|out of the convent....
{7684}{7742}I thought we had the same reason.
{7762}{7822}We did have the same reason.
{7840}{7888}I just had an extra one.
{7945}{8058}I'm sorry I lied to you.|I couldn't do it now.
{8110}{8169}If you hadn't found this...
{8184}{8287}...you killed the person who|could tell you where it was.
{8308}{8358}He said we were partners...
{8364}{8422}...and then he acted alone.
{9497}{9561}-Where're you going?|-I must go.
{9565}{9617}What are you talking about?
{9673}{9788}This was under my door this morning.|It's over. He's been found.
{9805}{9902}It's Sunbury, 20 miles from here.|How would he get there?
{9908}{9980}Someone took him from the pool|to the river.
{9985}{10086}We should call the police and|file a missing persons report.
{10092}{10127}I must go. It's him.
{10133}{10177}I'll go too.
{10567}{10640}No, I'll wait. Fine.
{10646}{10714}-Wait in there.|-No, I'll be fine.
{10738}{10807}Just don't let him forget me.
{10820}{10867}You're not gonna light that?
{10872}{10933}You can light these in America?
{10939}{11012}I'm quitting. Nicorette.
{11078}{11115}Excuse me...
{11126}{11174}...my husband is missing.
{11228}{11275}I think this might be him.
{11281}{11330}-How long?|-Four days.
{11337}{11417}-You file a missing persons report?|-No.
{11452}{11525}He has left before|without telling you?
{11531}{11577}The description fits.
{11609}{11689}-John Doe, 180 pounds, six foot even?|-Right.
{11694}{11781}-Describe his clothes.|-It says the body was naked.
{11787}{11847}We don't tell the press everything.
{11853}{11928}I didn't see him the day|he disappeared.
{11933}{11976}Any jewelry?
{11982}{12027}A wedding ring, that's all.
{12043}{12094}He doesn't always wear that.
{12119}{12161}Can I see the body?
{12207}{12268}-Appendectomy scar?|-No.
{12316}{12372}I see. No.
{12408}{12439}Hold on.
{12467}{12563}Howie, I think Mrs. Doe is here.
{12897}{12969}Prepare yourself.|The sand does a lot of damage.
{13058}{13112}Oh, my God.
{13132}{13182}Is that your husband, ma'am?
{13243}{13277}No.
{13445}{13472}Poor kid.
{13478}{13557}Wasn't her husband.|Never saw him before.
{14118}{14152}Excuse me?
{14161}{14196}Mrs. Baran?
{14202}{14262}-Who are you?|-Forgive me for intruding.
{14289}{14319}Sit down.
{14399}{14437}Coffee, please.
{14490}{14602}I saw you at the sheriff's.|I got your name off the view request.
{14607}{14644}Shirley Vogel.
{14687}{14721}You're the police?
{14743}{14798}Cagney and Lacey|kind of thing.
{14804}{14893}They met with me once.|Research stuff. Nice girls.
{14913}{14957}I say "girls," is that okay?
{14969}{15099}Anyway, flash forward 10 years.|I'm on medical leave. The big C.
{15105}{15130}Air.
{15151}{15176}I'm sorry.
{15182}{15226}Whatever. I knew it was coming.
{15232}{15316}With my family, never two boobs|in a coffin.
{15321}{15394}I'm sorry, but why are you here?
{15407}{15457}Remember your husband?
{15514}{15583}Could I get some coffee, please?
{15599}{15686}You mean....|I'm sure he'll turn up.
{15692}{15780}Wrapped around a pier.|You drove all the way here--
{15786}{15833}That's kind of you.
{15838}{15913}Who the hell am l, right?|I don't blame you.
{15919}{15991}Look, I know an officer in Hazelton.
{15998}{16123}-I could call him, he'll get details.|-I don't want to make it official.
{16128}{16180}Suppose it's just intentional.
{16186}{16253}-Here's your coffee.|-I know what you mean.
{16272}{16303}Men.
{16368}{16420}How do they sleep at night?
{16468}{16553}They have sex, that's how|they sleep at night.
{16579}{16631}He might be home already.
{16653}{16745}This place. Jesus.|It's no Sizzler, is it?
{16759}{16811}He'll be mad if I go to the police.
{16826}{16937}That's it. Keep it private.|Once they get your hooks in you....
{16946}{17021}I couldn't afford you.|We run a school.
{17027}{17105}A school? Then forget the police.
{17110}{17180}You can't afford the publicity.
{17191}{17267}Two, three days, I chase him down|to a girlfriend's...
{17272}{17331}...and scare him.
{17336}{17379}That wouldn't be easy.
{17408}{17433}Look...
{17439}{17486}...I don't want money.
{17500}{17593}Look at me. I'm chasing all|over for lunch dates...
{17599}{17677}...with guys I couldn't stand|10 years ago.
{17696}{17762}It'd give me something to do.
{17829}{17867}You ever smoke?
{17972}{18082}Look at this security system.|What's this? A piece of the Cross?
{18130}{18170}Aren't you hungry?
{18176}{18245}I thought I should eat, but....
{18277}{18325}You know what your problem is?
{18335}{18371}You're feeling guilty.
{18386}{18412}No...
{18425}{18456}...I'm not.
{18472}{18594}It's not your fault. It's men.|Testosterone.
{18605}{18657}They should put it in bombs.
{18695}{18725}Want that?
{19977}{20050}Mrs. Baran would like me to help|informally.
{20108}{20184}Well, Miss Vogel--or is it Detective?
{20189}{20226}Detective.
{20243}{20370}Detective, I don't think we need to|overreact. We've seen this before.
{20379}{20407}We have?
{20471}{20550}We, we, we. What is she,|the school nurse?
{20559}{20611}When did you last see your husband?
{20625}{20665}Last Saturday.
{20714}{20826}He was asleep when we left at 7.|Nicole and I drove out to her duplex.
{20832}{20858}Look!
{20864}{20978}This must be nice when it's full.|Isn't it dangerous, empty like this?
{20983}{21034}We lost some keys in there.
{21040}{21140}We should get back to our|students, they're on work crew.
{21146}{21236}I noticed. Must save money having|the kids work.
{21242}{21283}These older buildings.
{21289}{21348}His friends don't know where he is?
{21354}{21418}We haven't asked them.|It's kind of awkward.
{21424}{21493}"My husband's disappeared.|Have you seen him?"
{21510}{21584}Her husband.|It wouldn't be awkward for me.
{21590}{21681}If it's okay with you,|could I look at his address book?
{21686}{21778}We needn't make a|mountain out of a molehill.
{21784}{21857}Exactly. This place|crawling with police?
{21863}{21956}Wouldn't be something|to write home about. We'll tiptoe.
{21961}{22033}-Will you show me his things?|-Of course.
{22113}{22153}Nice meeting you.
{22417}{22500}This is lucky. The phone bill.
{22508}{22544}It came this morning.
{22593}{22630}May I?
{22766}{22809}This must be Miss Horner.
{22815}{22864}Pittsburgh. Earlier this month.
{22870}{22965}I call her there when she goes|there on weekends.
{22988}{23018}53 minutes.
{23024}{23079}72 minutes. Girl talk.
{23164}{23265}This is through Monday.|He didn't call you over the weekend?
{23317}{23431}-What kind of car does he drive?|-We have one car, the blue Cherokee.
{23437}{23528}-How'd you break the taillight?|-I don't know. It's old.
{23575}{23632}What was he wearing when he left?
{23649}{23707}His blue suit.
{23729}{23765}Can I see his closet?
{23784}{23817}Yes.
{23916}{23987}It's missing. His blue suit...
{23999}{24063}...and his belt with|the silver buckle.
{24069}{24145}You just have to look and you know.|Good for you.
{24162}{24242}A place for everything|and everything in its place.
{24261}{24358}I hope we're not too late.|There's video cameras out there.
{24368}{24461}-The news?|-No, it's some PR for the school.
{24467}{24546}-Is that all? I'm very tired.|-Of course.
{24574}{24603}The address book?
{24609}{24642}It's in his office.
{24649}{24674}I'll find it.
{24770}{24865}Just one more thing.|That isn't the suit there, is it?
{24948}{25036}You need to take Vawze's classes--|Oh, you're still here.
{25042}{25146}I was wondering if this is the suit|Dr. Baran was wearing on Sunday.
{25160}{25209}But close. He had two.
{25252}{25330}I'll go speak with|some other teachers now.
{25516}{25554}Why bring her here?
{25559}{25670}I'm supposed to act concerned.|Anyway, it keeps the police away.
{25675}{25706}Fine.
{25713}{25835}That woman should wear a prosthesis.|I hate all that survivor crap.
{25882}{25938}I'm really tired, Nicole.
{26066}{26152}It's okay. You did fine.|I heard you.
{26200}{26265}Just don't see her alone anymore.
{26359}{26388}Promise?
{26648}{26689}Can I get a printout of that?
{26695}{26742}You can get a dub too.
{26911}{26995}This is really cool stuff.|Inside Edition material.
{27000}{27077}The Magic Hour tape.|This guy gives "prick" a bad name.
{27083}{27108}What doesn't?
{27178}{27226}I want this one too.
{27441}{27533}Okay, if X equals four,|then X minus 2 is?
{27539}{27573}-Two.|-Great.
{27579}{27661}Ten plus X, when X equals 3 is?
{27693}{27719}I'm talking to you.
{27725}{27787}-Thirteen.|-Thank you.
{27832}{27880}Mrs. Baran needs you.
{27906}{27951}Review these equations.
{27957}{28065}Continue to work them until I return.|And stay in your seats.
{28326}{28367}This is Miss Horner.
{28380}{28446}Nicole, this is Lisa Campos.
{28514}{28585}Miss Campos is looking for Guy.
{28616}{28722}I'm sure Mrs. Baran told you that|Dr. Baran is away on business.
{28742}{28798}You said you didn't know where he was.
{28830}{28879}Well, someone has to pay.
{28885}{28917}He said he would.
{28923}{29021}I thought it over.|I don't want to wait until next month.
{29059}{29095}Excuse me?
{29102}{29154}Miss Campos is expecting.
{29172}{29234}Unto her, a child will be born.
{29300}{29374}-How is Dr. Baran involved?|-What do you think?
{29398}{29460}What makes you think it's Guy's?
{29465}{29544}That's what he said.|But, come on, I would know.
{29567}{29614}I don't sleep around.
{29624}{29661}He said he'd pay.
{29667}{29750}I'm not putting it on my card.|I'm maxed out.
{30076}{30156}So you're absolutely certain|this is Dr. Baran's?
{30162}{30245}-What does she have to say?|-Abortion is murder.
{30251}{30312}I'm gonna have an anesthetic.
{30324}{30365}How much will this cost?
{30371}{30444}They want 650, and that's a clinic.
{30449}{30567}I'm not holding anybody up here.|I want what he promised. Besides...
{30573}{30690}...it's your husband.|You don't want me to have his baby.
{30785}{30915}I wouldn't have come, only he said you|knew about his girlfriends.
{31052}{31087}Thank you.
{31154}{31237}And tell him not to call|when he does get back.
{31254}{31297}It's boundary time.
{31339}{31380}Incidentally...
{31430}{31510}...when did you last see Dr. Baran?
{31539}{31576}Sunday afternoon.
{31582}{31680}I dropped by. He was real wired up|about something.
{31694}{31732}Figured you two had a fight.
{31761}{31815}Make him pay you back.
{31876}{31906}Anyway...
{31917}{31947}...goodbye.
{32067}{32141}-You knew about her?|-Yeah.
{32167}{32225}Since last fall.
{32250}{32300}Right after you came.
{32337}{32386}You should've told me about her.
{32392}{32495}Why would I want you|to be hurt like I was?
{33064}{33106}Somebody knows.
{33505}{33615}They got a license plate.|They could've gotten a number wrong.
{33621}{33751}It looks like his car was there.|But we don't know if he was driving.
{33808}{33915}I told Mrs. Baran I ran Dr. Baran's|license plate through the DMV.
{33921}{34012}That pileup Monday on the l-80,|he was in it.
{34019}{34118}The report doesn't say much,|but his car's on the printout.
{34123}{34220}-You said that was an old dent?|-Did I?
{34238}{34315}Let's say he left Sunday,|wearing a blue suit.
{34321}{34364}Maybe to Pittsburgh?
{34370}{34445}He stopped for gas Sunday|in Williamsport.
{34462}{34558}Yes, Mrs. Baran gave me his credit|card numbers.
{34571}{34664}Anyway, it seems he was trying|to see you.
{34672}{34725}Pittsburgh is a big town.
{34762}{34845}You're sure you didn't hear from him|after Saturday?
{34869}{34925}That's not something we'd forget.
{34995}{35070}-Aren't you on room checks?|-Excuse me.
{35084}{35125}I'll be in touch.
{35147}{35187}I'm glad she didn't ask.
{35192}{35300}The cards weren't charged from|Sunday on. What are room checks?
{35306}{35366}Drug searches.|Kids here used to use.
{35372}{35428}My son had a habit years ago.
{35434}{35511}My husband and I looked for places.|He's dead.
{35517}{35563}-Your husband?|-Son.
{35569}{35657}IV drug users.|You know what happens.
{35663}{35704}But my ex is alive.
{35710}{35800}-Isn't God quirky? You got an ex?|-Nothing official.
{35806}{35884}Mine felt he was God's gift,|like that was on my list.
{35890}{36005}God, please send me someone who|wears black nylon socks to bed.
{36014}{36087}My heaven is where|they screw you barefoot.
{36093}{36180}-You make me want to pass the hat.|-Don't feel sorry for me.
{36186}{36314}He left. Every cloud has a silver|lining. He was too dull to kill.
{36334}{36422}-Did she want to kill her husband?|-Why would she?
{36428}{36486}Maybe she found out about you and him.
{36492}{36593}That's clever. Did you ask|the faculty or the students?
{36599}{36661}I know. You read it in the brochure.
{36667}{36750}-She knew?|-Of course she knew. Ask her.
{36756}{36839}Come on, she's not a murderer.|She's an ex-nun.
{36858}{36887}Remember them?
{36893}{36961}They disappeared overnight,|like dial phones.
{36971}{37031}And you?|What if he wouldn't leave her?
{37040}{37134}If I couldn't get a man to leave her,|I'd kill myself.
{37164}{37200}He has left her...
{37206}{37279}...apparently.|One way or another.
{37336}{37434}-Unless there's anything else....|-Just one more thing.
{37464}{37501}Guy did it barefoot.
{37569}{37596}"Did"?
{37614}{37658}Don't you mean, "does"?
{37889}{37925}Mrs. Baran?
{37953}{38004}It's dinnertime, Erik.
{38010}{38080}You should go inside with the others.
{38090}{38130}Are you okay?
{38151}{38204}You know the rules, Erik.
{38209}{38264}Your table can't eat without you.
{38284}{38347}It's so much nicer here since he left.
{38367}{38413}I hope he never comes back.
{38622}{38684}-Where'd you find those?|-I found them yesterday.
{38689}{38735}Give them to me.
{38773}{38871}-They're good, just a little rusty.|-Give them to me!
{39145}{39186}It means nothing.
{39192}{39290}The pool was empty and maybe he|saw them at the bottom.
{39307}{39365}I didn't. Did you?
{39384}{39470}If they were so plain to see....|See what it means?
{39475}{39522}It means we overlooked them.
{39527}{39629}It means Guy's watching us.|He's alive.
{39641}{39699}He's dead. And I'm not sorry.
{39718}{39806}And neither are you, if you're honest|with yourself.
{39812}{39907}Killing him is a good thing,|like planting a tree.
{39932}{40051}-Maybe there is a God.|-What're you talking about?
{40086}{40145}I haven't believed for so long.
{40169}{40227}When the pool was empty,|I thought...
{40238}{40284}...maybe there is a God.
{40303}{40401}And he knows what we did.|And he's coming for us.
{40432}{40555}It's not God, honey. That's a lady|detective with one breast.
{40577}{40630}You're always laughing at me.
{40658}{40699}So was Guy.
{40723}{40775}He must be laughing now.
{40795}{40845}I'm not laughing at you, Mia.
{40877}{40935}You are, a little...
{40958}{40991}...inside.
{41090}{41160}It's lonely without God, isn't it?
{41169}{41215}It's just lonely...
{41249}{41285}...period.
{42621}{42671}They're filling the pool!
{42761}{42878}-When will it be done?|-Soon! It's great!
{46779}{46836}We should have canceled this.
{46841}{46925}Everything's fine. Just calm down.
{46958}{46999}20 bucks they killed him.
{47015}{47110}-Dykes.|-That's why they're not all over you.
{47115}{47140}Thanks.
{47205}{47258}We could use Dr. Baran in this.
{47264}{47318}He's still away on business.
{47323}{47362}I don't want to be in it.
{47508}{47601}It's Parents' Day and these are|your parents.
{47612}{47720}Boys, you're happy,|but try not to look relieved, okay?
{47745}{47853}"I'm glad to see you, but boy,|is this school great!"
{47860}{47927}Moms, some of you can look|misty-eyed.
{47938}{47986}-Who wants to be misty?|-Here!
{47992}{48075}All right, you and you.|Don't overdo it.
{48084}{48162}Everyone have their numbers?|Number one.
{48197}{48242}Is that Dr. Baran?
{48258}{48301}What?
{48308}{48346}Up there, second floor.
{48468}{48525}Wait, I'll play it back.
{48858}{48912}It's someone, that's for sure.
{48939}{48977}It's Guy.
{49008}{49046}It's Guy.
{51089}{51130}What're you doing?
{51139}{51217}I'm fasting and praying for our sins.
{51253}{51347}I want you to stop that.|Come inside.
{51362}{51396}You're not well.
{51402}{51508}Each time I go to sleep,|I have to kill him over and over.
{51529}{51615}No, Mia, someone's playing|a game with us.
{51629}{51721}Come inside. You're ill.
{51800}{51832}It's holy water.
{51886}{51925}Come on.
{51988}{52048}What are you looking at? Go inside!
{52058}{52116}-Let's go.|-Go in!
{52154}{52179}Go!
{52358}{52449}-Where's your medicine?|-I'm sure it's there.
{52466}{52570}No, I think you're out.|I'll go get it refilled.
{52636}{52686}You should take these.
{52725}{52770}Here, go on.
{52810}{52905}-You'll be out before I return.|-I want you to go.
{52917}{52981}-Okay!|-No, I mean, away.
{52986}{53056}Leave the school, for good.
{53069}{53108}I'm sick of you.
{53171}{53285}-If they only knew.|-They will if you act like this.
{53299}{53410}The church can't save you,|no matter how much you pay them.
{53436}{53497}I know you gave|that priest my money.
{53505}{53574}Money shouldn't go to people|who love you.
{53579}{53629}It should go to people you love.
{53687}{53798}They don't love you, they used you.|You're scared so you're using them.
{53803}{53929}Like you used me? You were a good|teacher. We should've paid you more.
{53934}{53998}-You like playing the victim.|-Get out!
{54003}{54043}Leave me alone!
{54049}{54166}Fine, if that's what you want.|But from one saint to another:
{54171}{54290}Keep praying. Wear your knees out|that way for a change.
{58402}{58440}Hello?
{59459}{59495}Hello?!
{61884}{61918}Who's there?
{62027}{62069}Who's there?
{63632}{63670}Get the water bottle.
{64405}{64446}He's dead.
{64451}{64526}He's dead. He's dead.
{64532}{64625}God forgive you.|He's dead.
{65942}{66012}You're a lot tougher than I thought,|you little bitch.
{66160}{66206}Jesus, Guy.
{66213}{66289}Sucking on that douche bag hose|for 8 hours.
{66315}{66370}And that ride in the back...
{66377}{66416}...I've still got a cold.
{66421}{66530}I don't care what doctors say.|That fucking heart was made of iron.
{66565}{66629}I tried to reach you to call it off.
{66644}{66711}Call it off? What for?
{66729}{66786}I wish I could've seen her face.
{66791}{66835}The gags were great.
{66852}{66916}What will we do with|that detective?
{66922}{67002}Snooping around. She got hers.
{67007}{67060}You were supposed to call me.
{67089}{67135}You should find the body.
{67147}{67240}I'll show up tomorrow|and you break the news to me.
{67245}{67284}I'll be grief-stricken.
{67367}{67406}I think you should go.
{67425}{67450}Go?
{67558}{67612}Why? Haven't you missed me?
{67720}{67779}That's better. It's over.
{67788}{67832}So let's celebrate.
{68008}{68080}I don't want you to get caught.|You bet--
{68086}{68118}Is this natural?
{68152}{68204}I mean, the tub was full.
{68303}{68384}-Shouldn't she be undressed?|-Yeah, okay.
{68521}{68561}I thought she was dead!
{68567}{68647}I thought she was. I did.|It's over.
{68652}{68734}-She won't do anything.|-Lying bitch!
{68762}{68827}-Just let her go!|-You're with her!
{68832}{68890}-You are.|-No, I'm not! Mia, go!
{68930}{68958}Bitch!
{69032}{69070}Just you wait!
{69773}{69823}Don't you run away!
{69866}{69907}I said stop!
{70102}{70134}Come here!
{70224}{70270}Let me see your face!
{70290}{70366}Was it lonely, or did she|keep you company?
{70378}{70496}How's it feel, after years of|sainthood, to find us a perfect match?
{70502}{70564}You're just like me. Soul mates.
{70625}{70650}Bitch!
{70822}{70862}Want to confess before you die?
{70882}{70974}Say, "I'm sorry, Guy."|I'll forgive you, even if God won't.
{70979}{71014}Fuck you!
{71254}{71361}You son of a bitch.|This is a week late, asshole.
{71821}{71856}Oh, Jesus.
{71932}{71964}Mia, come on.
{74710}{74790}This way it'll be easier to claim|self-defense.
{74853}{74925}You know, paramedics|can work miracles.
{74945}{75005}One of us should go get one.
{75342}{75382}I'm sorry.
{75666}{75701}Goodbye.
All the monkeys were back in their cages...
in time for the matinee.
The circus will be in town two more weeks.
Thanks to early morning rush hour fog...
twenty-three cars, four trucks, and one bike...
were in a massive fender bender.
Luckily, no serious injuries.
Highway patrol reports traffic moving briskly.
It's seven o'clock. 
Here's a recap of today's top stories.
On his second day in office...
President Romero fulfilled a campaign promise today.
He announced the formation...
of a commission on human rights violations.
The commission will investigate acts of torture and murder...
that took place between 1975 and 1980...
under the military junta.
Rumors swept the capital about who will be named...
to chair the controversial and powerful committee.
Attorney Gerardo Escobar, civil rights activist...
and on the short list for Minister of Justice...
met with the president for an hour this afternoon.
...president's office has refused to comment.
Informed sources said...
Mr. Escobar has accepted the committee chairmanship.
In other news, as expected,
President Romero appoint--
Quite sure you won't come in?
No, thanks.
Home and a hot bath.
Me, too. 
Sorry for the trouble.
- No problem.
- Then why not drop in someday?
Thanks again and good-bye.
You know it's crazy--
I never introduced myself.
Gerardo Escobar.
Dr. Roberto Miranda.
Nice to meet you.
If you're ever passing--
- Escobar the lawyer?
- That's right.
It's OK. It's me!
- Power's out. Again.
- Shit.
Did you have an accident?
A flat in this.
Can you believe it?
What a nightmare.
You want a towel?
Oh, God.
Who was that?
It was the guy who stopped to help me.
I practically threw myself in front of his car.
He didn't have a lot of choice.
You made a lovely dinner.
I'm sorry.
I was going to be here on time.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Not your fault.
Stop apologizing.
It's only chicken.
Why are you wet?
I was looking for you-- patiently awaiting my captain's return from the sea.
It blew out about a mile past the lighthouse.
Right in the middle of nowhere.
Be a good girl.
How'd the meeting go?
I always forget how deserted that shore road is.
Seriously, if that guy hadn't come along...
I'd still be stuck.
- He has a house here?
- Yeah, on Salt Pond.
Really was very good of him.
He went way out of his way to take me home.
This suit is completely ruined.
What a nightmare.
The phones are out, too.
Shit.
I have to call a tow truck.
We have no car.
He drove me to a gas station, but it was closed.
I don't want to leave it out there.
Anything could happen.
Thanks.
You're not having any?
I ate.
I was hungry. 
I'm sorry.
Now you're apologizing... but you're apologizing for the wrong reasons.
When you get a flat tire... most people-- actually all people-- go to their trunk and get what?
An interrogation-- my favorite thing in life.
A spare tire.
Uh-huh. 
A spare tire.
In the pouring rain, wearing their best suit... they jack up the car, remove the flat... getting dirtier until, after a grueling struggle... they finally put the spare on.
This is a brilliant narrative, full of surprises.
I didn't know that all people who change tires... wear their best suits.
Just the classy jerks, like me.
A complete physical wreck,
I finally get the spare on... only to watch it sag.
You had two blowouts?
No. You're not listening to me.
The spare was flat.
You never fixed it.
You didn't notice it was flat until you'd put it on?
Well, that was dumb.
So, your conclusion is I was dumb?
Oh, no, my love,
I believe we all agree... including the president... that you are a highly intelligent man... but it was dumb to put a flat spare on the car.
Don't feel bad.
Even geniuses do dumb things.
So, did he ask you to head the commission?
God, it's very hot in here, isn't it?
Congratulations.
It's the peak of your career.
Not the peak, I hope.
I meant the first peak.
You'll go from peak to peak,
I'm sure.
I'm very serious about the spare.
You were supposed to take care of it.
And how did he react when you turned him down?
It's a very complicated situation.
It's much, much more complicated than we thought.
Shit. What am I going to do about the car?
- Fuck the car.
- Great.
Are you going to tell me what you said to the president?
Did you change his mind about the rules?
Why don't I tell you all about it later, OK?
I really don't want to discuss it now.
Fine.
Oh, come on!
- OK. Let's talk.
- Too late.
Nothing's been decided yet.
I told the president
I had to discuss it with you.
You told our brand-new president you had to ask my permission?
Of course.
So you told him about me?
Of course not.
Listen, nobody knows about you.
No, somebody knows about me.
But I'm not talking about them.
Don't lie! 
I hate that.
What's the point?
I know you're lying.
What am I supposed to be lying about?
Of course you said yes.
- OK. I'm sorry.
- God damn it!
Don't apologize.
You think you can pay for anything with those words.
If you were really sorry... you would've said no to this whitewash.
You would've said,
"No, Mr. President...
"I won't dignify this betrayal!"
- It's not a betrayal.
- Bullshit.
We have to move very slowly.
I can get the commission to accomplish a great deal.
What will happen to the men you prove were on the death squads?
The evidence will be turned over to the courts.
To the courts.
Yeah. Maybe to that judge who told Maria Bautista... her husband wasn't tortured to death.
He just ran off with a younger woman.
If this happens every night,
I can't do this job.
- Good.
- It's a job that's worth doing.
I don't exist.
Once the truth starts to come out...
I can get the president to change the rules.
But you didn't change his mind.
It's still only cases that ended in death.
You have to give me time.
Make love to me. 
Let's be happy.
Happy?
That's real bullshit.
We can.
Just give me time.
Give us time.
I promise you
I'll get them for you.
I'll bring you justice instead of a flat tire.
Let's dream of happiness, my sweet girl.
My bride.
- My savior.
- I want to.
I want to help you be brilliant and important.
I want us to live like suburban idiots.
I want to adopt a baby and spoil it.
My beautiful boy.
My beautiful, beautiful boy.
It's a car.
- There's a car here.
- What?
Wake up.
What is it? 
What?
- OK. I'll go.
- Don't.
It's OK. It's OK.
Who is it?
It's Dr. Miranda.
I've got your tire.
- Oh, Christ.
- What?
It's OK. It's nothing.
I'm coming!
It's the guy who stopped to help me with the car.
It's OK. It's OK.
Christ. 
Just a minute.
I forgot to take it out.
Of course. 
I'm so stupid.
I drove home and got into the shower before it hit me.
- Oh, I woke you.
- No. I was just, uh...
Is your power out, too?
Yeah. 
The whole peninsula for a change.
- This is very kind.
- It's no problem.
I could've picked it up.
How? On your bike?
You have no car.
I couldn't call, and you needed the tire.
I'm really sorry for what I've done to your weekend.
Stop that.
You're being nice... but it isn't necessary to keep apologizing.
I'm all alone.
My wife took the kids to her mother's.
The house is so empty...
I probably wouldn't be able to sleep.
Want to know the truth-- the real, real truth?
Truth is, I'm a fan of yours.
I was so stunned when you introduced yourself...
I couldn't say anything.
On the way home,
I heard the news on the radio.
I'm thrilled to meet you.
On the radio?
What did you hear?
About you and the commission.
You're doing the most important work.
I couldn't resist the temptation to come tell you.
What exactly did you hear?
You're going to chair the commission.
That's not supposed to be announced.
Oh, well...
I wouldn't worry.
They said it was rumors.
Leaks, I guess.
This was on the news?
I followed your career ever since you petitioned... on behalf of the missing prisoners in...
Anyway, I just want to tell you what a thrill.
A real thrill-- a mud bath and a sleepless night.
No, no. 
I'm serious.
With you on the commission... there's a real chance for our country.
Well, I hope we can do some good.
I'm sure you will.
So you see,
I'm glad to be of use.
I had an ulterior motive.
Sir.
Listen... this time, you have to have a drink.
I can't send you into the dark and stormy night... without some reward.
- I shouldn't. It's late.
- Just one drink.
I'm afraid my wife's already in bed so--
Oh, shit. 
I woke her, too.
No, she's still awake.
I have to turn my lights off.
To tell you the truth... she gets a little nervous because of the bad old days.
We both used to get pretty freaked... by that knock on the door in the night.
Oh, God. I should've left the tire and gone quietly.
No. You just taught me a very valuable lesson.
Please, sit down.
In a democracy, the midnight knock can be friendly.
- Want a whiskey?
- A teeny-weeny drop.
More than just a drop.
I'm just going to go check on Paulina.
Excuse me.
Are you asleep?
- I'm very tired.
- What?
I'm almost asleep.
Come out and say a quick hello. 
He's harmless.
Are you too tired?
Must be from listening to the news.
What?
Never mind.
I'm afraid my wife's almost asleep... but she sends her thanks and apologies.
- I know I must seem ridiculous.
- Why ridiculous?
I am ridiculous, especially when my wife's away.
She would've told me to go to bed.
"Bring it in the morning.
"You'll wake those poor people, scare them half to death.
"You think Escobar's a great man.
"Don't give him a heart attack."
I suspect we're all lost without our wives.
You must be excited about the committee.
Now I know who's running it,
I'm very optimistic.
Yeah, I am pretty optimistic despite my being on it.
You're modest, too.
That doesn't surprise me.
Don't you think this could be a real turning point?
It's a step in the right direction.
Even though we can't put those bastards on trial... because they gave themselves amnesty... we can make their names public.
A ground rule is the names aren't going to be made public.
Really? 
It doesn't matter.
The names will leak out.
Their kids will know.
They'll ask...
"Is it true you did those horrible things?"
Those fucks will have to face their own flesh and blood.
Maybe.
That's a kind of justice.
It's possible, well, likely, people will get so pissed off... when they hear the details of these crimes... they'll revoke this bullshit amnesty.
Any move in that direction is dangerous.
The army has only stepped aside.
They haven't disbanded.
My wife must be letting in some air.
It's stuffy.
The storm didn't really cool things off.
I think we're being too merciful.
I'm for killing the whole bunch of them.
Really? With all due respect,
I can't agree with you.
Isn't that what the death squads proved?
Killing doesn't end it for either side.
Still out.
The president says the army is very, very unhappy... making a lot of veiled and not so veiled threats.
How depressing.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe my idea about the children learning the truth... is just a fantasy.
You've taken my point too far.
If you really want to know... the president told me-- this is between us--
Oh, I won't tell.
Not even my wife.
Especially not your wife.
The president told me... in actuality, there are hundreds and hundreds of people... ready to make statements.
Now, once this begins, with luck, it could snowball... and we could know everything.
Jesus. 
You may be in danger.
- Danger of what?
- Well, you said so yourself.
They're out there.
They have a lot to hide... and they have the guns.
Stop! 
That's my car!
God damn it! 
That's my car!
Shit!
I'm such an asshole.
I'm yelling, "Stop, that's my car" to a thief.
He's glad it's my car.
That's the whole point.
I'm sorry.
It's probably some kids out for a joyride.
This time, I really do have something to apologize for.
My wife took your car.
She went for a tire?
I don't understand.
Where did she go?
She's pissed at me.
Jesus. 
'Cause you had a flat?
I thought my wife was unreasonable.
No, she took money.
Had some in the house.
She took it all.
Well, that's weird.
Well, then, she's a woman.
Why am I surprised?
Is she coming back soon?
Is this a twenty-four-hour deal or a week or what?
How will I explain this to my wife?
This has never happened before.
We fight. We have fights, but she's never...
Oh, shit.
I really thought that she understood.
She's left me.
Fuck women.
She'll be back.
Well, that's the bad news.
Oh, come on. 
You love her.
I didn't think I'd feel this shitty.
- I thought I'd feel relieved.
- Relieved?
Be careful.
Let me tell you something.
She has not been easy.
She's got a lot of reasons, but she's crazy.
They all have reasons, and they're all crazy.
You know what Nietzsche said?
I think it was Nietzsche.
I always say it was Nietzsche.
It's probably Freud.
I mean, he said everything.
If it's quotable, it's probably Freud.
You're very funny when you're grief-stricken.
That's the only way to suffer.
What did Nietzsche say, or whoever else?
Whoever said...
"We can never entirely possess the female soul."
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Sure, you do.
You go insane wanting them.
It doesn't matter what it costs you.
You pay the price... but you still don't get what you expect.
What do we expect?
- Approval.
- What do we get?
No. Don't tell me.
I know, I know.
Guilt.
- Guilt?
- Right.
Boy, that's interesting.
We each get something different.
Each man gets the very thing to keep him coming back for more.
Guilt.
And you?
Me, I get my balls cut off.
Your balls? 
That's what keeps you coming back?
Sure. 
I want them back.
- Did you hear the phone?
- No. It's not working.
Sure?
Should be fixed by now.
I hate this.
All these fucking things don't work!
Hey, come on, man, take it easy.
I hate this house.
It's like her.
We're both too fucked up... to know what to think about anything anymore.
Let's get some sleep.
What a disaster 
I've made of your life.
Not my life. 
Just one night.
I know I shouldn't really say this...
'cause you're feeling so terrible... but I'm enjoying myself.
She'll be back in the morning.
You'll see.
Then you'll have a headache.
And it won't just be the booze.
Well, at least we became friends tonight.
We sure did.
Oh, God, I'm drunk.
Let me show you the spare room.
No, no, no. 
I'll be all right.
- You sure?
- Sure.
Why?
Shut up, bitch.
Dr. Roberto Miranda.
So that's your name.
I've waited so long to be... properly introduced.
Keep still, motherfucker!
You know,
I thought you'd be bigger.
I had a friend at school named Miranda.
Anita Miranda.
They were from St. Esteban.
Maybe you're related.
They were a very respectable family.
Many of them were doctors.
Do you know Anita?
That's right.
That was my tactic, too.
Admit nothing.
Well, Anita and I, we were going to be doctors... just like you.
You don't recognize me.
Well, why should you?
It's been forever.
My hair was different then.
Very light brunette.
Almost red.
Very long.
I'm not surprised.
What time didn't change, I have.
I didn't want you to recognize me.
I didn't want to recognize me.
Still don't know?
I'm hurt.
But I was touched... when I found this in your car.
Let's listen to it.
For old time's sake.
Out here, my love.
I didn't get my diploma when I was released.
I didn't go back to school.
You can guess why.
Shouldn't require much imagination on your part.
Look at me!
Luckily, Gerardo was waiting.
Well, I shouldn't say waiting, exactly.
But let's just say he still loved me... so I didn't have to go back.
You know how long it's been... since I listened to this quartet?
If it's on the radio,
I turn it off.
Once, I ran out of a dinner party just to get away.
It made me sick... physically sick, to hear it.
But it's time for me to reclaim my Schubert... my favorite composer.
And to think I threw out my entire collection.
Don't touch him!
- What is this?
- It's a miracle.
He's delivered himself like a surprise Christmas present.
- What's going on?
- It's him.
- Who?
- The doctor.
The doctor who played
"Death and the Maiden."
- The doctor who...
- Yes. It's him.
You were blindfolded.
- The voice.
- His voice? That's it?
- That's it.
- That's it?
That's enough for me.
Paulie, you're ill.
- I'm not ill.
- You're ill.
All right, but I can be ill and recognize a voice.
Jesus fucking Christ!
Are you trying to kill me?
It's him.
I'm telling you, it's him.
Your memory of a voice doesn't prove anything.
His voice, his laugh... his favorite phrases.
I would recognize him anywhere from his pet phrases.
It may be a teeny-weeny thing, but that's the real, real truth.
- Paulie, this isn't funny.
- No, it isn't funny-- not a bit.
He's bleeding.
Want me to clean you up, Doctor?
My angel of mercy?
"She can take more.
"Give the bitch another five volts.
"Her sweet cunt is still wet."
Paulie, this is about me.
You're angry with me.
About you?
I knew you were vain, Gerardo.
You're angry because
I ignored your feelings... because I said yes to the commission.
I know his smell.
Remember that? 
Remember?
You like my love bites.
You told me so.
You hungry, bitch?
You want some meat?
I'll give you some meat.
I'll give you a big, fat sausage.
Christ, Paulina.
That's how your new buddy talked to me.
This has got to stop.
Even if he is guilty, you can't torture him like this.
Torture? 
Head of the president's commission... you call this torture?
You know so little about your subject.
Give me the gun.
As you would say-- I'm sorry.
While you're holding the gun, we have nothing to discuss.
The minute I give up the gun, all discussion will end.
Paulina, please.
Stop saying my name as if I'm a child.
You're behaving like a child, as if there are no consequences.
What you're doing will destroy any hope... of exposing the real criminals.
He is the real criminal.
Listen to me.
I'm in no hurry. 
I'm listening.
What revolted me most about the old regime--
You can call them fascists.
I won't tell the press.
Let me finish!
What revolted me was that they ignored the evidence... and never allowed the accused to defend themselves.
No matter how sure you are... no matter how terrible the accusations... he has the right to defend himself.
But I have no intention of denying him that right, Gerardo.
I'll give him a chance to defend himself.
What are you talking about?
He's tied to a chair.
Look who I've gotten to be his attorney-- one of the most talented in the nation... a future Minister of Justice, no less.
If only I had been that well-represented.
Don't you agree,
Gerardo Escobar, Esquire?
He has a better chance to defend himself than I did.
Go ahead.
Take off his gag.
Consult your client... and prepare his defense.
It's OK. 
I'll handle it.
- Move away.
- Let me untie his hands.
Move away, or I'll kill him.
Water.
Get him some water, Gerardo.
There's a mike built into this.
At least that's what the man in the store told me.
I want everything on the record, scrupulously recorded.
Little did I know how handy this would be.
Nothing like cold water, huh, Doctor?
- Beats drinking your piss.
- You have to stop her.
Move away from him.
This is unforgivable.
Hold it. 
Everyone be quiet.
It's working.
We already have a statement from the good doctor.
He tells us tying a person up... and preventing him from speaking is unforgivable.
You know what, Doctor?
I agree.
It is unforgivable.
Please.
Proceed with your statement.
I don't know you.
I've never seen you before.
I don't know what it is you think I've done.
Obviously, she's insane.
She's not responsible for what she does... but you're a lawyer.
If you don't stop this, you're an accomplice... and you'll pay the price.
- You threatening?
- I'm not.
Yes, you were.
Let me make this clear.
The time for people like you making threats is over.
Out there maybe you bastards are still running things... but in here-- in here...
I'm in charge!
Understand? Me.
Is that clear?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it as a threat.
It's OK. He's not resisting.
Hear him out.
Quick! Get it!
Get the gun!
You didn't do anything.
You just stood there.
Of course he just stood there.
He's the law.
My God.
This is some kind of game.
You're part of it.
Paulina, I beg of you.
Tie his legs.
He's OK like that.
Tie his legs and do a good job.
Use the green rope.
I don't know who she is.
I don't even know what she thinks I've done.
You want to hear the charges?
I accuse Dr. Roberto Miranda... of overseeing and approving systematic beatings... and the use of electric shock on Paulina Lorca.
What?
I wasn't married then... although Gerardo recruited me into the student resistance.
He was my fearless leader, but you never knew that.
If I'd given you his name... he wouldn't be heading an investigating committee.
Some other lawyer would be investigating his death.
And in addition,
I accuse Dr. Miranda... of raping Paulina Lorca on fourteen separate occasions... each time playing Schubert's
"Death and the Maiden"... on a wobbly turntable over cheap speakers.
Raped?
You never told me you were raped.
I was. 
Of course I was.
This is crazy.
I've nothing to do with any beatings or tortures.
Paulie, we have to talk.
- When was this?
- In 1977.
I wasn't even in the country.
I was in residency in Barcelona for three years.
Check with them.
- Sure. I'll write a letter.
- Make a call!
Why don't we just drive to the police station... ask them to call for us?
Oh. 
We can't drive, either.
We have no car.
Our car had a flat... and your car has also had an accident.
Went right through the guard rail and down the cliff.
I don't think you could've survived such a crash, do you?
You're an expert on how much punishment the body can take... before death is the result.
That's what they called you in for, wasn't it, Doctor?
This is insane. 
Is this a trial?
You're willing to be an accomplice... to kidnapping and murder, too?
I have to talk to you.
For God's sake, go ahead, talk.
Privately.
In your chambers?
All right, on the deck.
What a sad and beautiful man
Schubert must have been.
Only thirty-one when he died.
Did you know he was homosexual?
Of course you do.
You told me.
"He was a faggot.
"You don't like faggots.
You like a real man's cock."
I'm a gentleman. I'd never say anything like that to a lady.
Enjoy it.
We won't be long.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask?
You knew.
You're an expert.
You've listened to hours of testimony.
They did it to us all.
You told me everything else the doctor did... how he supervised the torture--
- I told you nothing.
- Nothing?
Actually, very little.
Almost nothing.
All these years because you took it for granted that I knew?
There's a difference between knowing the facts... and hearing the details.
If I'd told you, he'd always be between us.
We'd never be alone.
I understand.
Remember how young we were?
I miss us, Gerardo.
So we're here, Paulie.
We're still here.
I understand what you feel, but even if he is guilty...
Even if?
Do you realize what you've done?
Yes, darling. 
Absolutely.
This is kidnapping, assault.
We'll go to jail for twenty years.
Think what that'll do to the movement.
It's the kind of excuse the authorities look for.
We've given enough to the movement.
I've given enough.
If you thought you recognized him... why didn't you tell me?
You wouldn't have believed me.
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
More than anything.
You have no proof.
- What will you do with him?
- Put him on trial.
This isn't a trial.
It's terrorism.
Do you love me, Gerardo?
We're supposed to be different.
We can't use their methods.
I'm giving him all the guarantees he never gave me.
He has a lawyer.
I'll listen to his defense.
That's bullshit.
You've already convicted him.
The evidence is your own testimony.
- If you want the real truth...
- The real, real truth.
You're not a reliable witness.
Because I'm crazy.
Any court would tear you to pieces.
Five years ago in the Taveli Cafe... you heard a voice you recognized--
I never said it was him.
You panicked on a bus when a man touched your shoulder.
Stop it.
You can be cold, Gerardo.
I'm being truthful.
Isn't that what you want?
It's too serious to spare your feelings.
You're not killing him.
Kill him?
You really think I'll kill him?
Why did you crash his car?
I didn't crash his car.
It's parked on the road.
I made that up to make him think 
I mean business.
I'm not the secret police.
I have to create the illusion of threat... or he won't take the trial seriously.
What are you trying to do to me?
Oh, my baby.
My poor, gentle baby.
I'd never do anything to hurt you... or the commission.
I don't want to stop you... from finding the bodies of the missing... or getting the crimes on record.
I love you.
You're my life.
But you're only investigating... the cases of those who are dead, who can't speak.
I can talk now.
I'm free for the first time... since I was buried alone with this terror... until...
I've got him, Gerardo... and he's the one I wanted, the worst of them.
The others were thugs.
I expected them.
But he was a doctor... supposedly there to make sure they didn't kill me.
He talked about science and philosophy.
- He liked to quote Nietzsche.
- Nietzsche?
"I think it was Nietzsche."
He was so friendly, so thoughtful.
After a horrible session, he gave me a shot.
To soothe me, he said... to ease my suffering, he said he would play music.
I want to tell you.
Do you really want me to?
Because I can.
You really think you can stand it?
Well, I told you I was... blindfolded.
They had me tied to a table... face up... except when they decided to put me face down... in a bucket of my own shit, but this day-- the first day the doctor came-- they were being kind.
They had all these wires, electrodes all over me... and a metal rod, like a penis, inside me.
When they shock you... first it burns, and then-- and then your body jumps... and it hurts where you're tied.
I was trying to scream more where it hurt less... a little trick, but it didn't work.
The doctor came in.
He told them I'd had enough.
He sent them away.
He gave me a shot.
I felt warm.
That pain was gone.
I didn't think it could go, but it was like magic.
He cleaned me up.
He put something on my wounds.
He told me I was safe... and that he would play
"Death and the Maiden."
Did I like Schubert?
"Oh, yes," I said.
"I love his music."
I thanked him.
I thanked him and thanked him... and we listened together... like a couple of people who care about each other... and for the first few minutes, he didn't do anything.
Then I heard him moving around.
It sounded like his belt dragging on the floor.
I heard the change in his pockets jangling.
I heard the whisper of his clothes coming off... and, suddenly, he was on top of me... slobbering sick ideas.
He pushed himself in.
And, God, it hurt... like fire.
I screamed.
I screamed as hard as when they shocked me... but he wouldn't stop.
He wouldn't stop.
I love you.
Let me hold you, Paulie.
I don't trust you.
Understand? I can't.
I'm sorry. I know you hate me saying it, but I am sorry.
And after he'd finished... he turned the music off and said good-bye... with one of his pet phrases...
"No bones broken, right, baby?"
I know it's him.
I'm positive.
What do you want?
My first thought was that I wanted to rape him.
That's what I thought... that he should know what it's like... but a woman can't rape... so I thought it would be something you would have to do.
Paulie, please.
It would be difficult for you.
After all, you need a certain amount of enthusiasm.
Stop it.
Then I wondered maybe
I should use a broomstick.
That's enough.
I know it's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous because no revenge can satisfy me.
That's what they're about-- crude power and control.
I don't want to fuck him.
I don't want him dead. I--
I want him... to talk to me.
I want him to confess.
To confess?
I want to get him on videotape... confessing to everything he did, not just to me, to all of us.
After he's confessed, you'll let him go?
I don't believe you.
You have to.
You have no choice.
If he repents,
I will let him go.
You and your commission will be safe.
With a taped confession... he won't send thugs or go to the police... or the video would be all over the TV... and I'll let him live.
As you say about our sad country, Gerardo...
I will let the past become the past.
We'll get on with our lives?
Yes. We'll have to.
We'll have to live with him.
What if he refuses?
Tell him if he refuses, then he's dead.
Is that a real threat?
What happened to you can't be condoned in any way.
You have to do this.
You have to convince him.
There's no other way.
What if by some incredible miracle... this is just some crazy coincidence?
What if he's innocent?
If he's innocent, then he's really fucked.
Will you please turn that off?
Know that I'm not allowed to come near you.
She's got the gun on us both.
Don't kid yourself.
You're an accomplice.
You can end it.
This is a charade.
You're playing good cop / bad cop.
I'm a victim, too.
Not from where I sit.
Dr. Miranda, are you--
What happened to Roberto?
We're not friends anymore?
Are you aware the secret police used doctors... as torture session consultants?
Everybody knows.
The Medical Association denounced it.
I signed their petition.
You weren't asked to participate?
I told you.
I wasn't even in the country.
Oh, this is hopeless.
If you don't want to die, you'll confess.
What?
She's promised if you confess and show remorse... she'll let you go.
My God.
You're no different from them... threatening to kill me if I don't confess.
You're supposed to be a democrat, a lawyer... a man who believes in justice.
What's she got on you?
What's her power over you?
It's not power.
What is it?
Gratitude and love.
She saved my life, OK?
What's this all about?
Why was she tortured?
What did that--
You know why.
I don't.
I don't understand anything!
What's that in my eyes, blood?
Is that blood?
Wait a minute.
Listen, he's bleeding.
I'm going to wipe it off.
Is that OK?
Go ahead.
What's going on? 
Tell me.
What's this about?
Remember one of the underground newspapers, "Liberation"?
Sure. Thanks.
Really? 
You said you were in Barcelona in 1977.
Everybody knew about those papers. 
Come on.
I don't know whether one was called "Liberation."
I just remember people talking... about protest papers later when I--
It's OK. 
It doesn't prove anything anyway.
It doesn't matter.
There were seven illegal broadsides.
I was the editor of the student paper "Liberation."
We protected ourselves.
No one knew each other.
Paulina went to the blind drops each week... and brought me our anonymous contributors' articles.
She was the only one who knew my identity... which is what they wanted.
If she'd given them my name...
But you know all this.
You're playing games.
I am not.
I admire you both!
I'm on your side!
I respect what she's been through.
Please, check on me.
Isn't there a way?
She wants a confession.
Confession? 
How?
How can I confess to something I haven't done?
Then make it up.
That's the only way she'll pardon you.
She's got nothing to pardon me for.
Don't you understand? 
Christ!
It's not her, it's you.
You're too fucking civilized to admit it's you.
You think I'm guilty.
You want revenge.
Yeah, I think you're guilty.
She recognizes your voice, your smell... all those peculiar little phrases of yours.
She remembered that you liked to quote Nietzsche.
And there's this.
For God's sakes, 
I've got dozens of tapes in my car.
I'm not alone quoting Nietzsche or my smell.
It's ridiculous.
She's making it up.
She's paranoid.
She's delusional.
You said so yourself.
She's crazy.
But so's the whole country.
I have to take a pee.
What?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Listen, I'm not sure about anything right now... but I'll tell you something.
I do know that she's serious.
All I said was I have to go to the bathroom.
No tricks, you understand?
You want me to pee in my pants?
He wants to go to the bathroom.
Can I untie his hands?
Number one or number two, Doctor?
Christ.
Well? 
Do you have to go wee-wee... or is there something more substantial in you?
Forget it.
A trick. 
That's what I thought.
It's not a trick.
God damn it,
I have to pee, you cunt.
That's the Dr. Miranda
I know so well.
All right, I believe you do have to pee.
Untie his legs.
Do it. Untie them and step away from him.
Don't move a muscle till I tell you to.
Don't make this any more grotesque than it already is.
Gerardo, shut up.
Take this.
Walk ahead of us to show the way.
Guest bathroom,
I think, for our guest.
Get up slowly and move slowly.
If you make any sudden movements... the gun might go off, even if I don't mean it to.
I can't, not like this.
Yes, it's very difficult, isn't it... to live without privacy or pride?
- You'll get used to it.
- Paulina.
Quiet, Gerardo.
I guess we have to try again later.
It isn't hard to humiliate or be humiliated, is it, Doctor?
Not that difficult to lord power over people.
It's no great achievement.
All done?
I guess I'd better wash my hands.
Oh, God!
Don't shoot. 
Don't shoot!
Don't move!
Don't fucking move!
Get the phone.
Hello, Mr. Escobar?
Pablo Milar, the president's executive secretary.
We've been trying to reach you for hours.
We've had a storm.
All electricity and phones were out.
Could you hold for the president, please?
The president?
Yes, of course I will.
I said don't move.
Sorry. 
I couldn't help it.
Don't make a sound.
I won't. I swear.
Be careful, please.
Shut up!
Yes, sir.
Sorry to wake you.
That's quite all right.
There's been a leak about your appointment.
It was on the news.
As usual-- don't think this is out of the ordinary...
there have been death threats.
Death threats to you?
I'm afraid death threats against me...
are a daily, even boring occurrence.
I mean death threats against you.
As a precaution, we're sending some men to your beach house.
There's been a storm?
Yeah. Everything's still out.
The lights are still out.
Probably the road's impassable.
So maybe...
They'll get through, but not until about-- What time?
About six o'clock in the morning.
It's unnecessary.
I'm safe here.
Why not send your men to my city apartment?
I'll be there Sunday night.
Couldn't stop them if I wanted to, and I don't.
Who was it?
I have to talk to you.
Don't move.
The president is sending cops here to protect me.
What? Why?
It's a precaution.
It doesn't matter why.
They'll be here by six.
We've only got--
Shit. 
You better hurry.
That's less than four hours.
They may even get here sooner.
We don't have time to get this confession.
Fine.
We'll kill him right away.
You're going to kill him?
Everything's taken care of.
We push him off the cliff onto the wrecked car.
- It'll look like an accident.
- You're serious?
It'll look like he lost control.
Push him off the cliff.
Maybe he'll hit rocks.
We'll do it where I wrecked the car.
You said you didn't do anything to his car.
I had to say that.
It's easy.
You lied to me?
There's no time for this.
It's simple. We push him.
With his hands tied?
We'll climb down, untie them... put him in the water, or the car.
Which is better?
In the water, he'll bang around.
Are you crazy?
Well, you know me.
Climb down? 
Move his corpse?
The tide will take his body.
They'll still know it was murder.
What am I saying?
I'm not doing this.
You promised not to kill him.
You only wanted a confession.
You don't want to push him off the cliff?
No. It's premeditated murder.
I won't do it.
Well, if you won't... you'd better get the confession quick.
Why don't you use the phone?
It's working now, right?
In the middle of the night?
Barcelona, it's daytime there.
And say what?
Ask for the administration office... for Elena Galvan, the Deputy Secretary.
- You're wasting time.
- She knows me.
She'll tell you
I was in residency in '77.
It won't matter.
I was there when your wife was under arrest.
Arrest. 
That's a good euphemism.
I couldn't have had anything to do with it.
Please, just make the call.
It's not going to convince her.
She's mad. 
She needs therapy.
You are her therapy.
You're telling me that if I confess... she'll forgive me and let me go?
Forgive you, no.
Let you go, yes... if your confession convinces her... and she truly believes you're remorseful.
My hands aren't getting any circulation.
Can you loosen them, please?
That's it. 
Fuck it!
I'm going to count to five, then I'm telling her... there's nothing more
I can do to save you. One--
- You're scared your career...
- Two-- will be destroyed if I get out alive.
If you confess, we have no worries. Three--
Stop counting. I can count.
Four is next. It's stupid!
Four.
All right. All right!
What do I have to confess to?
Don't start.
I don't know what to say.
Just imagine it.
But I don't know what she expects.
If I make it up and it's wrong, she may kill me anyway.
I know a few things.
Maybe I can help you.
Why don't you ask her?
Ask her what?
What she wants in the confession.
I'll write down exactly what she wants, OK?
No. 
She wants it to be genuine.
How can it be genuine?
I am innocent.
I don't see why you need to hear everything from me... to get him to confess.
I'm your lawyer.
I need facts.
I don't want you to be my lawyer.
I want you to be my husband.
I'm trying to be, but you're never satisfied.
Poor Gerardo.
There's never any pity for me.
I'm always wrong.
I'm sick of it.
I want to get through this and get on with our lives.
Is that so wrong?
I wanted to tell you the day I was released.
Even though I was a mess and in pain, 
I ran to see you.
Let's start with the day of your arrest.
Did you love her?
Christ, we don't have time for this. 
They're coming.
I have to interrogate him.
He'll have to write the confession, we tape it.
Did you love her?
You forgave me.
How many more times can we go over this?
I never asked if you loved her, just if you fucked her.
That was stupid.
You were in bed together.
What did I think you were doing?
We'll die from so much past.
There's too much pain.
We must deal with him.
He's the monster.
How many times did you fuck her?
Give me the gun.
I'll kill him. 
I'll blow his fucking brains out.
Will that make up for it?
No. I just want the truth for once... no evasion, no tact.
Was that the first night she'd spent with you?
So how many times did you fuck her?
I didn't know you were alive, Paulie.
That's an excuse.
I want the truth.
You'd been gone for two months.
You're going to shoot me now?
That's your new way of having a conversation?
We'd been lovers for a month.
I don't know how many times we had sex.
Were you in love with her?
You want the real, real truth?
Yes. 
Tonight, I want the truth.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything about how I felt since that night.
You came back beat up and crazy.
You were half-dead... taken punishment a thousand times worse... than anything I could have taken... and you did it to save my life.
How do you think I feel?
I would have given them your name to save my skin.
They would have broken me on the first day.
So you see, 
I don't really remember anything... about how I felt since that night you came back.
But I love you.
I love you.
It's been the logic of my life.
I have a feeling it's going to destroy me.
It was about two in the afternoon.
I'd made the pickup... on the corner of Huerfanos near the bookstore.
I heard them get out of a car behind me.
There were two of them... and one came up and took my arm... and said, "Hey, girlie, you're having a busy day."
The other put a gun in my ribs... and said, 
"Let's go away for the weekend."
I smelled garlic on his breath.
It's weird.
I'd wondered what he'd eaten.
I didn't resist.
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night.
I get so angry
I want to hit myself.
The street was crowded, crowded with students.
Maybe they would have fought for me.
I didn't cry out.
You were supposed to.
You told me, 
"If they come for you, yell your name."
"I am Paulina Lorca, and they're kidnapping me.
"This is an illegal arrest."
I was a fool.
They would have shot you.
They probably would have.
That was the problem.
You see, I wanted to live.
I wanted to see the future.
I wanted to be there to enjoy my happy ending.
I wanted to live for that glorious day... when I would once again rejoin the man I love... and live in a free country.
You don't have to describe the room.
She never saw it.
She was tied to a table, a wooden table.
Was it long enough for her whole body?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Whatever I don't know, just leave out.
She was tied with ropes.
Ropes?
That's right.
They beat her with iron rods on her back and thighs.
They burned her breasts with cigars.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
They put a rod... a metal rod in...
Go on.
I took part in ninety-four interrogations.
They told me the prisoners were dying.
They needed someone they could trust to care for them.
Why did they want to keep us alive?
He's supposed to be making a statement.
I want the truth.
That's all I want.
Wait.
"I believed they had a right to medical attention...
"and at first, that's all I did.
"I tended to their wounds.
"I checked on their health...
"but after a week, they said they needed my help...
"in supervising interrogations."
Who needed your help?
This is not going to work.
I thought we agreed he was only going to talk about what he did.
I didn't agree.
We haven't got time.
All right, go on.
Wait.
"I tried to protect the prisoners...
"from the worst tortures to prevent permanent damage...
"and to lessen the chance of death...
"from shock and sudden heart failure.
"I made sure that a sufficient amount of food and water...
"was given so there would be no deaths from starvation."
This isn't a confession.
It's a fucking testimonial.
Sounds exactly like the confession of a torturer.
You expect them to face the truth?
Tell them about me.
About me.
Wait.
"After three weeks, the daily sixteen-hour sessions...
"began to rub off on me.
"I tended to be impressionable...
"to be influenced by my surroundings...
"and the people around me.
"I lost my sense of my own identity...
"and my own moral code."
You liked it!
Tell the truth.
Jesus. 
Give him a chance.
All right, go on.
Get to it.
"When I--"
Wait.
"When I first saw Paulina Lorca, she was in very poor condition.
"She had had no food or water for three days.
"She was tied by ropes to a wooden table.
"She had been severely beaten on her back and thighs.
"She had burns on her breasts.
"She'd also been subjected to electric shocks...
"on her torso and genitals.
"I convinced them she would die...
"if the torture and starvation continued.
"I asked them to leave me alone with her...
"so I could gain her trust.
"I had tried this successfully...
"with a number of other prisoners.
"I tended to their physical plain--
"I tended to their physical pain.
"I played music to soothe their minds.
"Paulina Lorca was a very beautiful woman."
That's why you raped me?
Because I was beautiful?
It's my fault, right?
You left the ugly ones alone.
Would you stop interrupting?
You don't understand.
I obeyed women, honored women all my life.
That's bullshit!
You're going to die, Doctor.
I let your lawyer convince me to spare you... if you made an honest confession... but you're playing games.
You're deliberately making mistakes to look innocent.
He gave me all the details.
They came from you.
I never told him
I was tied with ropes.
You're lying.
This is worthless.
You're right.
They tied you with wires.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
Wires-- it was wires.
What did you tell him, Gerardo?
I didn't tell him anything.
I know you prepared him.
I knew you were going to, so I lied to you.
What did you tell him?
Ropes.
Understand?
You didn't tell him... so how did he know it was really wires?
Because it was wires.
You see? 
I'm not crazy!
Get the gun!
Don't move!
I don't want to shoot.
Back off!
Get that light out of my eyes.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I'm not a killer.
I don't want trouble.
Up! Up!
I just want out.
Back off!
To the window!
The window!
I'll go to the door, and then I'll leave.
- You won't get hurt.
- No. You wouldn't hurt a fly.
Listen!
I just want to get out of here.
You can keep your idiotic confession... and your ridiculous tape.
You can watch it every night.
It'll make great therapy.
If I see you on the beach... you'll forgive me if I don't smile.
I don't care what games you play in this fucking madhouse...
I just want out.
You fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Gerardo, get up.
Hurry.
What'll we do?
Take him to his car.
The confession game is over.
I believe I was the winner.
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.
That's it. 
We're taking him.
You got your confession.
You got what you wanted.
Let's forget tonight ever happened.
That's not what I want.
It's phony.
It's phony because he's innocent.
He didn't even want the tape.
He didn't want it because it's absurd.
It looked staged.
A man with a bandage talking like a robot.
Get up.
Get me that dish towel.
Paulie, wait. 
Wait, wait.
I have to think.
You think. I'm going.
What are you doing?
Let me make this call.
Let me call Barcelona.
We've got time.
It'll only take a couple of minutes.
You won't give up being a lawyer.
Paulie, please.
Is that what you need to do it?
What time is it?
Ten after five.
Five minutes.
That's all the mercy we can spare.
- Our Lady of Sorrows.
- Personnel office, please.
Not personnel.
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- There's no personnel office.
You want administration.
I'll transfer you.
Who do I want?
Deputy Administrator's office.
Ask if Elena Galvan is there.
Hello, is that administration?
Not again.
No. This is the cafeteria.
Shit. 
They just cut me off.
This is bullshit!
- We have to do it now.
- Let me try again, OK?
He isn't finished.
Just let me try again.
Wait. I beg you!
You should know how useless begging is.
Wait. Wait.
Let me check.
I'm almost through.
You've got to stop her.
- You have my confession.
- You told me you made it up.
Yes, but you have the tape.
I'll keep quiet.
He can't decide which lie to stick to.
Either you were there in April '77 or not.
What can I say?
If I'm guilty, you'll kill me.
If I'm innocent, you'll kill me.
If I'm innocent, you're screwed.
If I'm guilty, you'll kill me for revenge.
Justice, not revenge.
It's not justice!
You're not dead!
No. I wasn't that lucky.
Our Lady of Sorrows.
You just tried to transfer me to the administration office... and connected me to the cafeteria instead.
You want the cafeteria?
No. I want the administration office,
I'm calling long distance.
What extension do you want?
I don't know the extension.
Who do you want in administration?
I want to speak to-- 
Wait--
I want to speak to Elena Galvan.
No. The person I want is the Deputy Administrator.
- Hold on, please.
- Thank you.
Administration.
I have an application for employment... from a doctor who said he did his residency with you... from 1975 to 1978.
Could you confirm that?
The records office will confirm it.
I don't want your records.
I just want a routine confirmation... he did his residency at your hospital.
You can fax the records office.
Their number is--
Is there somebody there called Elena Galvan?
Elena Galvan?
Yes. 
I'm Elena Galvan.
Do you remember a doctor named Miranda?
You do?
Yes. 
Dr. Roberto Miranda.
Was he there in April 1977?
Yes. In '77.
Thank you.
It's true, Paulie.
I just spoke with Elena Galvan.
He was there, just like he said.
She remembers him.
Thank God.
You had it ready, didn't you?
You had it all set up.
Gerardo, is it the truth?
Is it the truth, Gerardo?
You told me yourself the army's been preparing alibis.
You said some of them have fake visas.
So this one has a crony at the hospital... who conveniently remembers... fifteen years later... where he was the very month he was raping me.
This is it.
We're going to end it here.
Look at me.
Isn't it bright enough to see me?
Don't you know me?
Didn't you tell me your ugly thoughts?
Didn't you tell me your secrets?
Didn't you rape me?
Didn't you put your cock in me?
How many times?
Many times.
I raped you many times.
Fourteen times.
You played music.
Yes, I played music.
I wanted to soothe you.
I was good at first.
It took weeks.
I was strong.
I fought it so hard.
No one fought as hard as I did.
I was the last one, the last one to have a taste.
No one died, I swear.
I saved many, and I made it easier on them.
That's how it started.
That's how I got into it.
They needed doctors.
My brother was in the secret police.
He told me they needed someone to make sure nobody died.
I washed you.
You soiled yourself.
You told me, "I'm dirty," and I washed you clean.
The others egged me on.
"Come on, Doctor, you're not going to refuse free meat."
I couldn't think straight.
And inside, I could feel
I was starting to like it.
They lay the people out... flesh on the table in the fluorescent light.
You didn't know.
It was bright in those rooms.
People lying totally helpless, and I didn't have to be nice!
I didn't have to seduce them!
I realized I didn't even have to take care of them.
I had all the power.
I could break anyone.
I could make them do or say whatever I wanted.
I was lost.
I got curious.
Morbid curiosity.
How much can this woman take?
What's going to happen to her vagina?
Does it dry up when you shock her?
Can she have an orgasm afterwards?
I liked being naked.
I would undress slowly.
I would let my pants fall... so you could hear what I was doing.
I liked you knowing what I was going to do.
I was naked in the bright light, and you couldn't see me.
You couldn't tell me what to do.
I owned you.
I owned all of them.
I fell in love with it.
I could hurt you, or I could fuck you... and you couldn't tell me not to.
You had to thank me.
I--
I loved it.
I was sorry it ended.
I was very sorry it ended.
I can't do it, Paulie.
I just can't.
The curse of God on you!
God bless him.
Isn't he great for his age?
Miss Grubb, you bold thing, you're taking us home.
It's the third Sunday, the day for the cemetery.
I know. I thought you might like to pick up Master Godfrey.
Godfrey is not next or near the house.
Jesus!
He's at the dentist.
You have the height of luck,
Mr. Doyle-Counihan.
Sunday dinnertime... many a professional man might be intemperate.
Now, local anesthetic.
I got it at the local.
Mr. Clancy, suddenly I feel a lot...
That's what they all say.
When you think of it... this is the only place in the world... where toothache is unknown.
Open up now, sir.
Think of your mammy's lovely house burning to the ground.
- Huh?
- That's the stuff.
- Now, identification parade.
- Uhh!
You'll tell me when I get warm, won't you?
- Fair dues now.
- Ohh.
Aah! Aah!
Are you sure?
We're on the pig's back... so I won't need to pull that bugger.
It'll walk out.
Still, no sense in discouraging business.
Ohh...
- Hold still now.
- Aah!
- How's the mammy?
- Mmm.
Fresh and well she's looking.
The woman, I always say, is born for widowhood.
It is her natural vocation.
The woman is incomplete until himself is six feet under.
Aah!
Who are you telling?
You, sir, are, as yet, a youngish man... but you may have noticed... that no sooner does a widow leave off wearing her weeds... than people are never done telling her how ravaging... how ravishing she looks.
Would you say, now, that is why your own mammy... having been twice bereaved... is ahead of the field in the beauty stakes?
No one's going to tell me
I don't disinfect.
I dote on women, so I do.
I could look at them until the cows came home.
Mr. Doyle-Counihan,
I would not, at this minute... be putting you through the agony of the damned... except that the first
I set foot in this town...
I saw her...
Miss Katherine O'Hare... a jewel, a skylark in the hen house.
She's as poor as Job's ass in a town that's as rich as God.
She has the smallest house... and the sweetest smile on Widows' Peak.
There's a secret about her, would you say?
Where does she fit in?
If you know, don't, whatever you do, tell me.
I like a woman with a bit of mystery.
Oh, the first day
I clapped eyes on that one...
I made up my mind.
If she ends up as anyone's widow, it'll be as mine... or I'll swing for her.
Aah!
I have good news for you.
Back that at a hundred to eight, you bollocks, you.
Ladies, that'll do.
Enough's enough.
We don't want to spoil them.
Uhh!
Oh, Mrs. Lacey, no getting morbid.
If you please, ladies.
It's a busy day for us.
Anything stirring, Miss Grubb?
It's Clancy the dentist.
He's calling on Miss O'Hare.
Oh, show.
It's too late. They've gone in.
The silly woman.
You'd think she'd had enough of that sort of carry-on.
I do hear tell he is overly fond of his jar.
He's a man. That's enough.
- What, dear?
- I said he takes the snuff.
Oh.
Good morning, Miss O'Hare.
I hope I didn't hunt your visitor.
Oh, Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, not at all.
Mr. Clancy was just admiring my roses.
Sure, why wouldn't he?
Would you like a jaunt?
- Excuse me?
- Get in next to me.
"Sure, where's the harm," says you, "in a bit of style?"
How are you, ma'am?
People do pay me compliments on my roses.
I do tell them there's not a ha'p'orth of skill involved.
A weenie bit of loving care, maybe.
Mind, I'll own up to it.
I wouldn't mind one day to grow a rose of my own.
- And you will, please God.
- I don't know.
But if I ever do,
I'll call it the Widows' Peak.
You'll what?
In honor of our little kingdom and how snug we are in it.
My dear,
I hope you'll do no such thing.
Widows' Peak?
That's the name used by all the jealous boots in the town.
Miss Grubb, slow down.
It's the Lucy girl.
The poor creature.
What poor?
Now, we gave her every chance, so we did.
Get it adopted, we said to her.
But, no, she'd sooner make a show of herself and of us.
Where will she go?
Where do you think she'll go?
Why else did God in his goodness invent England?
A new rose, now that'll be nice for you.
And, of course, it means you won't be leaving us.
Is it me?
For gracious sake, why would I want to leave?
Now, aren't people scandalous?
The way they talk, I mean, about yourself and Mr. Clancy.
About...
Corner-boy gossip.
But don't mind it.
The word is, he's popped the question.
Hello. Hello.
- The question?
- One question or the other.
Excuse me?
And we all know what the other is.
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan...
Mr. Clancy is a gentleman through and through.
He would never dream...
Miss O'Hare, do you see the green in my eye?
Now, listen here.
You know me of an old date... and I'm not one to rub vinegar into a cut... but it doesn't do to have too short a memory.
I mean, we don't want that carry-on a second time.
- Once bitten...
- Yes!
And a woman of your years...
Has the man no decorum?
So it's true, then?
Old Mrs. Melody's cottage has been sold.
Now, there's another excitement.
Well, I'm too old a dog to act in breach of my instructions.
Your revered mother...
R.I.P... laid down the terms under which property on Widow's... on the hill may be leased... no children under adulthood, no males of any kind... except in the case of your son Master Godfrey... and no married or single ladies... unless by exceptional consent of the residents.
In short, ma'am, all is well.
Oh, rather, the new owner of Melody Cottage... is, unhappily, a widow.
Unhappily.
And, what is more, a war widow... or, at least, a postwar widow.
Her husband,
Major Broome, V. C... recently died of wounds received in 1918.
Will you go to God? A V.C.?
Do you mean...
Are you saying he was in the English army?
No, he was with the Germans.
Wait till word gets out.
And do you mean that that man's wife is coming here?
If you please, Miss O'Hare,
I'm talking.
Now, I can't say
I'm partial to military men.
They have a coarseness
I can do without... but a medal now is different... especially when it's from what they call...
For valor?
Posthumous, I was going to say.
Posthumous is nice.
And his wife?
There are no children?
You're certain?
The lady is a bird alone.
In fact, she should be flying in just anytime now.
Shit!
Hey!
Damn it.
Oh, my...
Had a puncture?
No, my car threw me.
Let me give you a hand.
- Ha ha.
- Ha ha, yourself.
Thanks, but don't you think... you might get dirt on that fancy dress of yours?
A few spots? Who cares?
The very thing.
Mrs. Broome, isn't that it?
Ten out of ten.
I saw the removals van.
I'm Godfrey Doyle-Counihan.
The mammy and I live up the hill from you.
- Up Widows' Peak.
- Widows'...
In Kilshannon, Mrs. Broome... widows are as plentiful as freckles on a redhead.
Maybe you knew that.
I came to Kilshannon for the climate.
What climate? We're in Ireland.
Was I misinformed?
Before you jack up the car... aren't you supposed to put a stone or a wedge... under the wheel to keep it from...
Mrs. Broome, would you say... that I'm doing you a small favor right now?
Don't tell me you want a favor in return.
Nothing of a disgusting nature.
Now, it's just that when you meet the mammy... and you will, don't let on to her that I can change a tire.
- Why?
- Well, God rest her... she thinks that I'm like the rest of the men, you know?
A bit helpless, bit of a namby-pamby.
You know what mammies are like.
So I put on an act for her.
I pretend
I'm helpless without her.
She'd never get over it... if she thought that I wasn't in the least bit helpless... that I could do things with my hands... like changing a tire.
Ahem.
I'll keep your secret.
Oh, look.
Are you in trouble?
Well, let's just say if I had a bad reputation... you're doing it the power of good.
Whoa! You've arrived.
Excuse us.
- I was married, you know.
- Yes.
And I still like a good stretch.
I'm sorry I can't offer you tea.
No teapot, no cups, no sugar, no cream, no tea.
I could, uh, light a fire.
A Boy Scout.
I'm sure you could.
Tell me, do you have a maid?
Not until now.
You'll need one.
Up here on the Peak... having someone in to polish your silver... marks the point where women leave off and ladies begin.
I don't make the rules.
The women do.
Or rather, the ladies.
And each one of them has a maid.
After you've been a widow for thirty or forty years... having a chaperone around the house... may not be a necessity, but it does wonders for the morale.
Mr. Doyle-Counihan,
I think you're a brat.
So let me give you a tip.
Out of the goodness of her heart... first thing the mammy will do is find you a maid... and ten to one, it'll be Mata Hari.
- Oh, yes?
- Maddie O'Hara, that is.
During the recent Troubles...
Dublin Castle had an intelligence network... that was only legendary.
Maddie would knock them the lot of them into a cocked hat.
The sorrowful fact is that where Mata Hari is concerned... there is no such place as no man's land.
- How many times?
- Fourteen, Canon.
She takes the front line with her as she goes.
- Was he married?
- My sister's husband, Canon.
Oh, dear, dear God.
Did you take pleasure in it?
I... I didn't mind.
Oh, dear, dear, dear God.
Trot out the details.
Spare me nothing.
So, Mrs. Broome, tell this poor admirer...
Is that what you are?
What brought a beautiful woman like you... to maybe end up on
Widows' Peak?
Truthfully.
When we're better acquainted.
Bargain.
There, that'll put a bit of warmth into you.
It's taking nicely.
It'll be roaring in no time.
Well, I'll love you and leave you then, so.
Oh, and remember, next time you see me with herself... don't let on to her that I'm such a handyman.
Mammy's the word.
Aha! Good luck now.
See you soon.
I can't wait.
Is this Mrs. Broome that's in it?
Yes. Hello.
I'm Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
What way are you?
God bless you, you're as welcome here as rain in a drought.
Thank you, I...
Creature, you, what are you doing... sitting where the people from the town sit?
Move down with us.
Yes, you will. Now, up you get.
No, really, I...
Now, don't be shy.
There's buckets of room.
Now, I say you will.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Thank you, but, really,
I was quite comfortable.
- It's not the thing.
- What?
We keep separate from the townies.
We don't mix, dear.
That's the custom.
Well, at least, some of us don't.
Miss O'Hare, make room.
There's a good woman.
Now, down you sit.
Isn't it a massive film?
I do hear tell you see God in the second half.
Miss Grubb, have you anything sweets?
So, tell, how are you settling in?
Yeah, no, wait.
Where is my manners?
Mrs. Broome, this is Miss O'Hare.
Oh, butter wouldn't melt, but a great character.
How do you do?
Ah, Miss Grubb... why are you tempting me, you bold strap, you?
Will I, won't I?
Will I, will I, will I?
I'll introduce you to the other ladies back at the house.
We're all going there for tea after the film.
Now, what was I asking you?
Oh, yes. Are you settled in?
I think so. It was a bit confusing to begin with.
The pace is so different in Ireland.
But I'm beginning to get the hang of it.
But you're not English after all.
Pardon me?
What I mean is, your accent is American, isn't it?
Oh, Lord, is it so noticeable?
Yes, well, I grew up in America, in Washington.
My father was military attache at the embassy there.
- Oh.
- The British embassy, that is.
Ah... grand.
Here comes God.
Thank you.
Then after the war...
I... I went to France... to visit Nigel's... my husband's grave.
I suppose one might call it a pilgrimage.
And they gave him a medal?
A what? The V.C., yes.
And I couldn't bring myself to go back to England... not to live there on my own.
We hadn't been blessed with children.
So I went south, to the Riviera.
I took a house at Antibes.
I was there seven years, since 1919.
And then I left, and here I am.
And where else would you want to live?
Nobody in their senses would live in France.
What made you decide to honor us, Mrs. Broome?
Don't tell me you were tired of the blue sea... and the palm trees and the sunshine.
No. No, in many ways,
I was sorry to leave.
But you did.
Miss O'Hare, you're being inquisitive.
If Mrs. Broome had a mind... to move out of one place and go live in another... isn't it her own affair?
Ladies, amn't I right?
- Yes.
- Of course.
I enjoyed living in the south of France.
There's no secret why I left.
I... I had to.
And as I say, I didn't want to go back to England.
There were too many... painful memories.
You had to leave?
Well, I hardly like to say.
I'm sure.
You see...
It is Miss O'Hare, isn't it?
I had been married, and, uh... now I was a widow, and I was still... forgive me, quite young.
And my husband had seen to it... that I was not uncomfortably off.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
I left Antibes because... because of men.
Because of fortune hunters.
Oh, wasn't that woeful for you, you creature, you.
Well, it was probably time to go, in any case.
I missed hearing my own language spoken... and I missed the kind of climate... where you get snow and sunshine and rain and fog... all in one day.
And Nigel had often spoken so affectionately of Ireland.
He loved this country so.
He told me how he used to come here for the shooting.
Really?
What did he shoot... Irishmen?
Uh, Miss O'Hare, honest to God.
Why not? It isn't as if we're ever out of season.
Mrs. Broome, don't mind a bit of her.
Miss O'Hare has had family misfortunes.
- Oh, dear.
- Oh.
And even so, we don't talk about such low goings on... as wars and massacres and people getting shot.
No. We leave all that to the men... seeing as they're good for nothing else.
Would you say that includes
Englishmen as well?
Miss O'Hare, I think you've exceeded your allowance.
Anyway, the fighting and troubles and such... aren't they all behind us and in the past?
No.
Uh, another piece of sweet cake,
Mrs. Broome?
No, no refusals, no.
Yes, you will, just in your hand. Godfrey.
How wonderful it must be,
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan... to have a son who's so helpful.
Oh, Godfrey's a wonder.
We'd be lost without him.
He's the only man here who's worth his salt.
A man? God forgive you,
Dolores Furlong.
She wants to put ideas into his head.
He's all I have, Mrs. Broome.
Oh, go on. You're an old cod.
Still, the mammy and I are great pals.
Oh, how lovely.
Are you in business,
Mr. Doyle-Counihan?
Godfrey.
I do have a profession, yes... the law.
But I don't practice much these days.
There's too many little jobs to be done around the house.
Oh, poor Godfrey.
Sure, he tries.
I'm sure.
That reminds me,
I'll be needing a housemaid... and I was wondering if you might...
With a heart and a half.
In fact, there was one woman
I heard about... who sounds like a pearl beyond price.
What was her name?
Oh, yes. Maddie O'Hara.
Oh, dear.
So, what do you think?
About the widow?
Well, would you not say you could do a lot worse?
Fortune hunters she ran away from.
You could be well-matched.
Oh, son, put away your toy.
Your mammy's talking.
I'm not one of those mothers... that thinks they can hold on to a son down all eternity.
Oh, you'll go from me someday,
I know that.
So, now, what do you think of her?
Now, Mammy, stop it.
No matchmaking.
I'll decide whether
I like Mrs. Broome or not.
You wasteful child, you.
What do you think Mammy is for?
Why do you think there's nothing but all divorces... in America and England?
Because people choose for themselves, that's why.
It's scandalous.
I think I'll call upon her
Saturday afternoon... and ask her to go for a stroll by the lake.
You do. Do.
And pretend you're as good as ten carpenters.
Yes. Make yourself useful.
Yeah.
A widow. That's good.
She knows what there is to know... and her stomach would have been turned by it.
She'll have learned her lesson.
She won't harm a hair of you.
I have made inquiries in the neighborhood... and really, Miss O'Hara...
Or Maddie.
May I call you Maddie?
You sound like absolute perfection.
Nothing but the highest praise, a treasure.
Oh, heavens,
I shouldn't have said that.
Now you'll want more money.
Well, let's not quibble.
Shall we say... whatever you were getting at your last place... plus five shillings a week?
I do, however, have two firm rules... that we must agree on from the start.
The first is no gossiping.
I will not have what happens... or is said in this house talked about.
Gossip? Is it me?
Oh, no, no.
Please, I wasn't for a moment suggesting that...
I swear on the grave of my mother that's dead and gone...
It isn't necessary.
If a word of gossiping or carrying stories... ever passed my lips or ever will pass them... may I be put sitting on the hottest hob in purgatory... and may I splutter steam...
Please, I...
Until Good Friday falls on a Saturday.
Maddie... Miss O'Hara...
I was merely stating a little rule of mine.
The fact is, everyone
I've spoken to in Kilshannon... agrees that they haven't heard... one word of scandal pass your lips.
They what?
They say one could as soon get gossip... out of the old town hall clock.
- Excuse me?
- And as for the other rule...
I can't abide doors or drawers or cupboards... that are under lock and key.
It's a little fetish of mine.
I like everything open and accessible... so of course I do need a person such as yourself... who... who doesn't pry... who respects the privacy of her employer.
Is that too eccentric on my part?
I'm dead. That's what it is.
I've died and gone to heaven.
- Good evening.
- You're ready.
Guess what. I've had an idea.
- You... you look...
- Oh, good.
I thought, as you've been so kind... as to take pity on a lady who's all alone...
I thought, why not make the most... of its being Saturday night... and instead of a walk, why not a dance?
Good God.
Whenever Nigel was on leave... we'd go dancing every evening and all at the Savoy.
People nicknamed us the Castles.
You've heard of them?
Vernon and Irene Castle from America.
Oh, well, the fact is...
Oh, don't tell me there's no place we can go.
I have a car.
I can drive us into Limerick.
Well, the fact is that around here... unless there's a party or a hunt ball...
Don't tell me there isn't any.
- Well...
- No music at all?
- Well, yeah...
- Good. Let's go.
Yes, but you have to be a certain...
Maddie, I'll be back before midnight.
If my luck runs out.
You don't get my drift.
This is not the kind of dancing that you... Oh!
This place we're going to...
Katy Daly's.
Who did you say?
It's what it's called.
I ought to warn you, it isn't exactly the Savoy in London.
For heaven's sake,
Godfrey Doyle-Counihan... don't you think
I can make allowances?
Potted palms, four old ladies... a harp, a violin, a piano, and a cello.
Who cares?
Con. Mr. Clancy.
How in the world do you do that?
It's the same as pulling teeth, only in reverse.
That woman... she's that peculiar friend of your mother's.
Miss O'Hare.
She oughtn't be here no more than us.
Mind you, she's mad.
She doesn't like the English much, does she?
I don't know why the mammy and the other old dears... bother to bid her the time of day.
They're such snobs, and she's poor as a church mouse.
Yes, why is that?
Have you ever thought to ask?
I did once.
I said to the mammy...
"What's the secret?
"What is this hold that Miss O'Hare has over you?"
And do you know what she said?
"Ask me no questions, child, and I'll tell you no"...
Oh. It's over.
Stay out of the ditches.
Good evening, Miss O'H...
Cold for the time of year, isn't it?
And now, ladies and gentlemen... the next dance will be an old-time waltz.
Ladies' choice.
And for this dance... the special spot prize will be two tickets... for the premiere performance of that great film...
"The Big Parade," starring John Gilbert.
Ladies' choice.
Does ladies' choice mean that I'm supposed...
Hey, mister, would you be on for a dance?
Uh, I'd... I'd, uh, I'd be delighted.
Jesus, I'm made for life.
Would you like to?
I was ready to slash my wrists.
Shall we?
Lovely orchestra, isn't it?
Do you come here often?
Terribly jolly, isn't it?
Jesus.
Now, now, now.
Everybody stay where ye are.
Don't move a muscle!
Off you go, Mrs. Fogerty.
Take five paces forward:
Over here!
Not a jig out of anyone!
One, two, three, four, five.
Are you there, Mrs. Fogerty?
I am.
OK. So now, um, turn right!
Take three paces!
One, two, three.
Yes?
Now, now, now, turn left.
Take six paces!
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Yes?
And now, last of all, and for the prize... turn left again.
Oh. Something disgusting stuck on my shoe.
And take two short paces!
One, two.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I lost my balance.
Have we a winner?
- We have!
- Excuse me.
Come back here!
There ye are.
And the great style of ya!
Who deserves it better?
I deserve it better!
That woman pushed me.
- Oh, Katherine.
- With all her strength.
Pushed you?
I did no such thing.
That's a lie.
How dare you.
I fell against you accidentally.
Yeah, to be sure you did.
The same your lot have been falling against us... for 700 years, accidentally.
I see.
I'll take that, if you please.
You will not.
While there's breath in my body, you will not.
- Kindly let go.
- Katherine, give it to her.
No!
Miss O'Hare, I have no desire for a public quarrel... least of all in public.
As far as this prize is concerned...
- You're welcome to it.
- Thank you.
Just as soon as you own up... that I did not push you deliberately.
Ha!
Katherine,
Katherine, just leave it.
Hey, Mossie, you're slipping.
You ought to dance with a better class of mot.
Huh?
That one would take the pennies off a corpse's eyes.
Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
Hey, hey, hey!
No rowdyism!
That's mine.
Then take them.
If women don't want them tickets, I do!
Ooh, Con, what's happening?
You should know. You started it.
Can you not do something?
Sure, if one of them needs a dentist.
Ohh!
I'm new here.
I don't know that woman.
I've never done her any harm, and yet she hates me.
Why?
Because you're English.
Is that the reason, really?
No.
Mrs. Broome...
Edwina.
Edwina.
Did you really bump into Miss O'Hare by accident?
Of course.
Well, good night. Thank you.
Most of it was lovely.
Thank you.
And I really enjoyed the drive.
Perhaps next week we could, uh...
Come for tea on Monday.
We'll talk about it.
Oh! By the way... the mammy wants you to sit on the Ladies' Committee.
It's to do with town planning and things like that.
It's as dull as a wet Good Friday.
I'll think about it.
I wouldn't if I were you.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, why did you ignore my advice about Mata Hari?
Don't you know that your private life... will become knowledgeable throughout... the length and breadth of the twenty-six counties?
I don't mind in the least.
I don't have any secrets.
Good night.
Good night.
If you'll excuse me saying so, dear... dance halls are for people not like us.
Now, I don't blame you, not a bit.
You're English.
You have no idea about social distinctions.
Miss O'Hare was at the dance.
Yes, well...
She's one of... us.
She is, and she isn't.
She's half and half.
What has she got against me?
I've tried to be friendly, but it's war to the knife. Why?
Why, why?
"Y" is a crooked letter, pet.
- What does that mean?
- I haven't the remotest.
Why don't you have a talk with her?
Yeah, be nice.
- I have been nice.
- Be nicer.
Put yourself in the right and her in the wrong.
Oh, there's Godfrey!
Mammy! Ha ha!
Coo-ee!
She wins prizes for her roses... every year at the Adare flower show.
Tell her how you never saw the likes of them.
Miss O'Hare.
Maddie, I'd like to talk to Miss O'Hare... privately, if you don't mind.
I brought you a peace offering.
It's just some fruit from my garden.
I have no use for it really.
The fruit, I mean, not the garden.
Miss O'Hare, don't you think... we could at least talk like grownups?
If I've done anything to offend you...
I promise you that it simply wasn't intended.
I knew in my heart it was no use coming here... but at least I tried.
If we're not friends, it's by your choice, not mine.
Good-bye.
Would you look at the face of her?
What ails the woman?
What badness is in her?
Is there any rhyme or reason to it?
I don't know.
She's rude and hateful... and there's no reason to it.
No!
Ma'am, them's the ones for the flower show.
She said,
"I brought you a gift. "
Next.
Ladies, are you coming in, or aren't you?
And then you know what happened?
She went over to the prize rose bush... and she broke two of them off and threw them on the ground.
This is a likely spot.
- For what?
- A proposal.
How did you know?
My late husband proposed to me in the Lake District.
He believed water was romantic.
Your own mother's never done saying... that all men are alike, so...
Well, in that case, it should be... like marrying the same man twice.
I came here to be rid of men.
Fortune hunters.
That excludes me.
We have pots of money, and so have you.
Otherwise you wouldn't be huntable.
There are those who would say we were well matched.
Including your mammy?
Especially the mammy.
You want to be rid of men?
Marry one.
I don't like idlers.
I'll go back to the law.
I don't like lawyers.
They consort with criminals.
No, they don't.
They consort with other lawyers.
That's what I said.
Isn't there some family business... selling bottled mineral water from the spa?
Yes. That's how we made our money... but the well dried up years ago.
Then import some water.
Better still, use ordinary water... and whatever makes it taste disgusting.
My God, you're as crooked as any lawyer.
Aren't I just?
When I receive your proposal,
I'll consider it.
Meanwhile, it's customary... to provide a sample of goods on offer.
Um...
Who's going to provide the sample?
Think of it as mutual.
Tit for tat.
Bloody fool!
What do you mean, fool?
That's my car!
Stop it!
Aah!
You say the woman on the bicycle was too far off... to identify as Miss O'Hare?
Well, allow me, if you'll pardon the expression, to mark your card, ma'am.
Even if you could identify her, and it was Miss O'Hare... there's not a shred of evidence... to say that she tampered with your motor car.
Then who else could have done it?
That's not a question a judge would put to a jury... especially not if the jury and the defendant was Irish... and the plaintiff was English.
It was she. I know it was.
Ma'am, I have a son in Trinity College... and a wife who says that without a fur coat... she'll die of pneumonia... so I could do with a fat lawsuit that would last a week.
I could assure it tomorrow against Miss O'Hare.
Then do it.
You'd lose... and the Irish are a litigious race.
She'd bring a countersuit against you... and the upshot would be... that she'd never need to take a lodger ever again.
A lodger?
Aye. The poor thing hasn't
2 ha'pennies to rub together... so from June to September, she rents out a room.
No. If you sue Miss O'Hare... you'll be backing the wrong horse.
She's too well liked.
Then what am I to do?
There's no end to her malice.
She's called me a thief in public.
My car was almost wrecked.
What next?
She's a harmless soul... a relic of old decency.
Between ourselves and these four walls... what did you do to her?
Own up.
Nothing. Well, not really.
Anyway, she started it.
It's because I'm English.
Are you codding me?
Mr. Gaffney, I see no humor...
Because you're English?
Yes. For some reason... she loathes and detests anyone who...
And who do you think her lodgers are?
Tourists on holiday... from London and Liverpool and Birmingham.
They come back year after year... because no landlady has ever made them... feel so much at home as Miss O'Hare does.
She hates you because you're English?
Come on, now.
You'll have to do better than that for a yarn.
Ma'am! Ma'am!
It's on the wall.
What?
What are you talking about?
Oh, ma'am, what's writ on it.
Writ? What do you mean, writ?
You mean written?
Written where?
The one thing I won't be is a hindrance.
Seeing as the regatta's upon us...
I'll do my bit, same as always.
The Ladies' Committee won't even know I'm gone.
Ah, will we not?
You think so?
And you, you'd throw away 30 years.
Now, change your mind.
Yes, you will.
If that woman is on the committee...
But she lives here.
She's entitled to be on it, as you are.
Katherine, it's not too late.
Now, what began as a quarrel is turning into a scandal.
There's talk of graffiti.
I know nothing about that.
And her motorcar won't be mended for a month.
Oh, she's clever.
I'll give her that.
It's all my doing.
Poor Miss O'Hare that's gone astray in the head.
It's all to be laid at my door.
And she's you fooled as well.
Me? How?
The car and the paint... and what happened at the dance.
Don't you see that she's the one behind it all?
It's part of what she's been up to.
And what's that when it's at home?
I think it's to do away with me.
To...
Because she knows
I can see through her.
I gave myself away... the first time
I clapped eyes on her.
Maybe she credits me with being smarter than I am... but at least
I know a gold ring... from the brass one you'd find in a sweet cake on Halloween.
A gold ring?
I'm talking about her... about her not being what she pretends to be... and that's maybe why one of these dark nights... poor Miss O'Hare will walk into the lake in her madness.
- Into the...
- Don't you see it?
Are you blind?
She's up to murder.
Miss O'Hare.
Well, ma'am, did you talk her out of it?
Quite the opposite,
Mr. Clancy.
I think she's tired of slaving for the committee.
She ought to rest herself for a month or so.
Aye, with all my doors and windows locked.
Watch her.
- What?
- I said watch her.
She trusts you in her innocence.
I don't, not so far as I could throw you... or the whole seed and breed of youse.
But I'm telling you to look after her, to mind her.
What is it that ails her?
I don't know.
She has queer ideas.
Has it to do with the past?
What?
I mean before
I came to Kilshannon.
I know there was something... because, well, I'm fond of her.
And I ask her about how it was... the time she was growing up, about herself.
She won't answer me.
She looks out of the window or at the lake... but not at me.
So what is it?
I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Clancy.
There's nothing in the past.
Nothing.
Would you like a hot cup?
There you go!
There you go!
Easy now, son!
Not too quick!
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it! Easy, easy!
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on.
Take it easy. Not too quick.
Steady...
Go on, go on, go on.
There you go.
Oh, Con! I'll fall in!
Not a bit of you!
Hold on!
Hey! Come back!
What about me?
- Admiral.
- Good to see you.
Grand. You're here.
Well, come on.
We'll get aboard, huh?
Well, what's the rush?
Well, the rally's in Inishkeen... and the harbor's a little on the tiny side... so the boats that get there last... have to moor out on the lake.
Is that so bad?
Well, it's all right rowing ashore... but rowing back to the cruiser isn't.
Do you mean because of the currents on the lake?
No, I mean because of the pubs on the land.
- Mrs. Broome.
- Hello.
Right, everybody.
Let's get aboard.
Come along, Mammy.
Lend a hand, Miss Grubb.
What fun!
Right, Mammy.
Come on. Up you get.
Up, up, up. That's it.
I think I'd better go in the car.
No, no, no, you won't.
Come. Get in the boat.
- Oh, Godfrey!
- That's it. Stop it, now.
Up you get. Lovely.
Hands and shoulders up! Lovely.
I wouldn't go next to or near a boat... only the doctor told me
I needed exercise.
That's right.
That's it, Mammy. Down below.
What next?
I never dreamed. I had no idea.
- What?
- That Ireland was like this.
I'm so glad I came here.
It's perfect.
Almost perfect.
Well, the "almost" can be rectified.
Say you'll marry me.
On this lake and under this sky?
The gods would strike us dead for our impertinence. No.
I'll say it on dry land.
- You will?
- Godfrey!
Oh, that's all right.
The boat will steer itself.
Look, not a feather out of it.
You'll say yes then?
Today I'd say yes if Miss O'Hare invited me... to drink a glass of her own blackcurrant wine.
Not bad.
You'll do.
Yes, you'll definitely do.
Is that her up ahead... the old witch, Miss O'Hare?
Yes.
Oh!
Just hold the wheel lightly.
That's it. Gentle.
Be gentle. Just a touch.
Pretend she's a woman.
You say the loveliest things.
Godfrey, will Miss O'Hare get to... wherever it is we're going ahead of us?
Inishkeen.
We're faster, but they've got a head start.
If we opened her up, we could make it.
We could be first round
Hamilton Point... and then again, we might not.
Then open her up, my future husband.
Whoo!
Oh!
She gaining on us.
I think it's a race.
Godfrey, stupid child, put the brakes on!
Won't it go any faster?
There are too many small boats around.
It's considered bad form.
We're not going to overtake them.
There's not enough water between us and the point.
You're heading for the shallow!
Go back to the channel!
We've done it!
We'll be in first!
- Yes!
- Good girl yourself!
Better luck next year!
Ha ha!
Jesus, they're on top of us.
We're never going to overtake them.
There's no room!
Then they can very well move over.
Look, do you want to see them on a shoal?
Do I? Oh, heavens to Betsy, what a terrible idea.
Edwina! Throttle back!
Let go of me.
Oh!
Get over!
Aah!
- Get back!
- Aah!
Oh!
Did you see what he did?
- Tighten those sheets!
- Hold 'er steady.
Katherine, are you hurt?
Ohh...
I'm fine.
Are we sinking? I can't swim.
It won't be necessary.
One of the few advantages of going aground... is that you can walk ashore.
- Do you need a hand?
- Are you hurt?
Can you hold on?
There's boats coming!
Can I throw you a line?
No! Don't let him.
Don't let them come near us.
Don't worry, I won't.
What are you trying to do, son?
Tow us out into deep water so you can sink us properly?
Well, at least let me help you aboard!
No!
It's all right.
We won't want for rescuing.
If the weather holds... you'll be back on the lake inside of a month.
All you need is a denture and a bit of bridgework.
I'm sure.
What's a couple of cracked bicuspids?
You'll be sailing this boat till you're a hundred.
Another 80 years, what?
Miss O'Hare, can I just say that we... my family, that is, will gladly pay for the repairs.
There, now.
It was my fault entirely.
I shouldn't have let Edwina...
Mrs. Broome... take the wheel.
I don't suppose there's any point in asking... if it would be possible for her to say how sorry she is?
I mean, it would just make the day perfect for us... because we're actually going to announce... that we're going to be engaged.
Oh, well.
That's great news.
Engaged, what?
God send youse good luck.
What do you say, Katherine?
She completely lost her head.
Didn't know the rules of the river.
Don't pass on the right.
Pass on the right.
No, it was just high spirits and lack of river sense... so obviously, we wouldn't like anything to spoil our...
She tried to kill us.
What?
Murder was what I said.
And I was right.
Ah, woman, you're raving.
While we've been sitting here,
I worked it out.
What she'd a mind to do was to ram us in the midstream... where the water's 40 feet deep.
Are the pair of you blind?
Can't you see what was going on in that murderous brain of hers?
And she'll try it again.
As long as she's not found out, she'll go on trying.
All right, Con?
Is this seat taken?
- No, no. Quite all right.
- Thanks.
Whoo! Ha ha ha ha!
Absolutely fantastic!
I say!
I thought you said it was dead around here.
It must be one of them mirages.
You don't hear a mirage.
You see it, you hick.
I love men when they're witty.
Excuse me, dear madam... but might one inquire what the occasion is?
If it's public.
It's the regatta dance... for the regatta and the rally.
Excellent. And forgive me... but are there nonteetotal beverages available?
Not for the likes of them that's had enough.
I don't know you.
Go 'way from me.
We don't know him, either, missis.
We gave him a lift from outside Nenagh.
Permit me, ma'am.
First Lieutenant Rokesby... of His Majesty's ship "Heroic. "
Lads, will we go to the old dance? Say we will.
At your service, ma'am.
The fact is, I've had a somewhat checkered 24 hours.
Fell into bad company in Dublin last night... and missed my ship.
Courtesy visit, you know, not bombardment.
So I thought I'd catch up with it in Cork... and took the road to Limerick by mistake.
Going to be the devil to pay.
- That serves you right.
- I suppose it does.
- And the devil's cure to you.
- Well, thanks very much.
Hey, admiral.
Is someone calling?
- Hey, limey, are you coming in?
- Oh, yes, why not?
Lord knows where
I'm going to sleep tonight.
Oh, I say.
Are you going, too?
Good. I have a partner.
Go away from me. Go on.
Shoo. Shoo.
Drunken Englishman.
Thank you. Keep the change.
You came in. Grand.
How do you feel?
Are you all well in yourself?
Oh, yes. I think
I'd like to go home, actually.
Excuse me, most gracious lady.
But may I have the pleasure of this dance?
No, you may not. Go 'way.
One small circuit of the floor is all I crave... or at least to as far... as where they're serving refreshments.
Am I in my own country at all, or amn't I?
They're everywhere I go, tormenting me!
Can't you see you're annoying the lady?
- That'll do you now.
- Are you saying I offend her?
Not at all. It's just she's not in form for dancing.
If it's a drink you want, it's down there. Good lad.
So much for the friendly Irish.
To you.
Uhh!
Good God, it is!
It's you!
Well, I'm damned.
Excuse me?
You... here, of all places.
My God, they do say it's a small world.
I'm sorry.
I've never seen you before.
Yes, you have.
Don't talk gammon, old girl.
But where the devil was it?
And I've forgotten your name.
Wait. You tell me who I am.
You're mistaken.
I really don't know you.
Now, you're making a nuisance of yourself.
The lady doesn't know you.
Come on, Edwina.
Edwina?
No, no, that's not it.
Yes. Now I remember.
It was at Antibes.
We'd put in at Monaco for repairs, and you...
Oh, my God: Yes!
I don't believe it.
You, here, of all places.
How damn priceless.
I don't...
Godfrey, I need some fresh air.
Yes, but they're going to make the announcement about us.
Fine. Well, let them.
Yes, but we have to be here.
Everyone's going to applaud...
For Christ's sakes, Godfrey!
Do you have to be so childish?
Con!
Why don't you treat Mr...
- Rokesby, ma'am.
- Rokesby to a drink?
- Thanks very much.
- Sure.
And of hope and glory
We'll take Barney Murphy's horse and trap... and I'll be back to him inside the hour.
A few more steps and a good night's sleep... and you'll be as right as the rain.
I have no drink in the house.
- What?
- For him.
- He wants more drink?
- I want more drink.
Wha... what's going on?
Why are we here?
Be quiet.
Up you get.
Can you manage it?
Oh!
Splendid Irish hospitality.
Infinitely obliged!
Don't worry.
You'll sing for your supper.
- There you are.
- Right.
- You got the door open?
- No.
- Home already?
- Oh, yes.
All ashore that's going ashore!
You'll frighten the horses.
You'll frighten the neighbors.
Steady, now.
Home, sweet home.
Oh, God. Time for beddy-byes.
Oh, no, Mr. Rokesby, the night is still young.
You and I are going to have a little drink.
Just first tell me...
Just you and I, as snug as two bugs.
I don't like just driving off... and leaving you on your own with him for the whole night.
Oh, aren't you a gorgeous man?
You're jealous.
You're as good as a tonic.
No, I'll be safe with Mr. Rokesby.
Even when the English are murdering you... they're always pure gentlemen.
Well, if you're sure...
Good night, Con.
Good night, Katherine.
Good night, Maddie.
Good night, Miss...
Oh! Tsk!
Now, then...
I'll be your sweetheart
If you will be mine
Good evening, Maddie.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
Are these what you were looking for?
I suppose you remembered that you'd forgotten... to re-seal my letters after you'd steamed them open.
What? May God forgive you.
I never.
May I drop down dead.
- It's the weather.
- I beg your pardon?
Rain one minute, sun the next.
Sure nothing sticks.
I knew there was an explanation.
Glue is useless.
What a climate.
True for you. It's fierce.
Maddie...
I want to know... about that woman O'Hare.
About Miss O'Hare?
There's nothing.
She has no money.
What does she live on?
Why doesn't she live in town instead of here on the peak?
She's nobody.
Why do Mrs. Doyle-Counihan and the others... put up with her? Huh?
What makes her one of them?
Is it blackmail?
What does she know?
Nothing.
It's the ladies who...
The ladies who know?
Who know what?
It was...
Well?
It was agreed long ago.
It was a bargain they made with Miss O'Hare... that it would never be talked about.
No, nor mentioned. Not ever.
I see.
Well, you're going to talk about it now.
Good morn to you, Miss O'Hare.
Isn't that a grand class of a day?
Grand, thank God.
I haven't clapped eyes on you since the regatta.
Were you not well?
Oh, no, I...
I thought it might be dangerous to go out.
They say everyone's got a summer cold... the kind you can't get rid of.
Will you walk down with us, or will you take the bike?
Ah. I think
I'll go on shanks' mare.
The banns are called between
Godfrey Doyle... and Edwina Broome, both of this parish.
If anyone can show just cause... why this marriage should not take place... he or she should do so to His Lordship the bishop... or to any one of the priests of the parish.
This is the third and last time of calling.
- Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
- Canon.
Well, the church clerk hasn't come haring around... to say that somebody's ready to swear to it... that the groom-to-be is in the Freemasons... so I think we can safely use racing parlance... and say that the tapes are up.
And as for you, young man...
I've never known anyone born so fortunate.
When I look at this beautiful young woman...
Mrs. Broome!
Miss O'Hare.
I wouldn't know a bit of you.
Such a stranger you are these two weeks.
Ought I to offer my congratulations?
I'd be very pleased if you did.
In that case, I do.
Ah, God love you.
And I congratulate myself as well.
I walked to Mass.
Did you know that?
I didn't take my bicycle... because the brakes weren't working.
Really?
Such a steep hill.
Wasn't I blessed?
But what I really congratulate myself on... is that once you're married, you'll be safe... and no one can touch you... not me, not anyone.
And that means
I'll be safe as well.
So that's the height of good fortune... for the pair of us, wouldn't you say?
Canon.
Safe?
W - what's she talking about?
What does she mean by that?
I have no idea.
Ah, the creature.
Old maids are the same the world over.
The poor mind always gives way.
Will you come up, Canon, for a bite of dinner with us?
What is it, Con?
I hope you went to early Mass... because you're late for this one.
What's happened?
Someone put this through my letterbox.
Whoever wrote it doesn't put his name to it... but I'd like to know if it's true.
Read it.
It's short, but not what I'd call sweet.
Well?
Ohh...
C - con, th-this sort of thing...
Is it true?
A...
A long time ago... a girl...
A different person. She...
Con, you can't walk away.
You can't walk away.
Ohh...
Lunch, Mammy.
Dinner, Godfrey.
There's me own sister...
Sister Teresa Gonzaga from the Carmelites.
They let her out on condition she doesn't talk.
And there's me cousin
Mossy Cooney... who's in the government... and Godfrey's uncle on his father's side... who was a gunman in the Troubles... and is the ambassador to the Vatican now... and the commodore of the yacht club... that's had the stroke, but is coming in spite of it.
Oh, such a dinner!
It'll be the talk of the county.
Excuse me...
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, for interrupting your lunch.
Dinner.
It's a private occasion, pet.
I know that, so I won't take up your time.
This morning,
Con Clancy got a letter.
It said as how
I'd had a baby 30 years ago.
Uh, Miss O'Hare...
The baby's father was a soldier... out of the garrison in Limerick.
It was the oldest story in the world.
I was that innocent.
I believed him when he said... he was off to fight some foreign war... and when it was over, he'd send for me.
It was 1904,
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
Your own Godfrey wasn't even into long trousers.
I remember the salt tears you cried... begging me not to keep the baby like I wanted to... but to give it to strangers.
You promised that no one in the town... would ever mention it or think bad of me... that it would be looked after.
What I wanted was to have the child... and rear it and be a mother to it.
But yourself and the ladies... them that I still see every day around me... you said that for me to keep it... would be an insult to good-living women... to them that were well in with God.
So in the heel of the hunt...
I went to Dublin and had her adopted.
And youse kept your word,
I'll not deny it.
There was the little cottage, all for myself... not a penny rent to pay... and I was never looked down on... because I'd done what was right.
I suppose I reminded youse of how good youse were... and how Christian.
The baby died.
Did you know that?
What? Well, no.
How could I have known?
When she was three.
I thought to find out... what kind of people she'd gone to... and if they were good to her.
It took me a long while, but I managed it.
I'm a great finder out of things.
She'd been with a doctor and his wife.
Nice people.
Only there'd been scarlet fever where they lived.
I felt sorry for them.
So...
Oh, your lovely lunch is going cold on you.
So this morning,
Con Clancy got a letter.
And now he's done with me.
Maybe it comes from having... too high a regard for a person in the first place.
It's not them you can't forgive for being human.
It's yourself for being so foolish.
Well, my secret is out, and my race is run.
Con Clancy will die in his own bed... and me in mine.
You were foolish, too,
Mrs. Broome.
If you hadn't hated me enough to want to destroy me with this, then I wouldn't be here now... and you'd be getting married to himself there.
What am I saying?
You might even have finished... eating the food on the plate in front of you.
Are you saying that I wrote an anonymous letter?
I'm sorry, but this lady is not herself.
Did I mention that it was anonymous?
I don't think so.
But 'tis no matter.
'Tis the day for them, all the same.
For letters, I mean.
We'll be at least agreed on that score, Mrs. Broome.
That name isn't yours, but then, I don't know what is.
This letter is from
Mrs. Edwina Broome.
She lives in Scotland.
Her husband was Major Nigel Broome... who won the Victoria Cross.
The War Office sent me her address.
Isn't it grand to know... the English are good for something?
She says that you're an impostor... and if I were you, I'd go back where it was you came from... before she sets the law on you.
Edwina, tell her.
Tell her what?
You tried time and time again to harm me... but at Mass this morning,
I said, "I'll say nothing.
"Let her marry him and get her hands on his money. "
You?
"And more power to her. "
I don't know why.
Maybe I lack for poison inside me.
Then Con got that letter.
You were wrong about one thing.
I'm finishing my lunch.
It's lovely.
You went to so much trouble... leaving all those papers around... for Maddie O'Hara to spy through.
No wonder you wanted her as a maid.
She was your best character witness.
The mistake you made was taking the name of a real person.
If you hadn't done that... all I had was the word of that young Navy officer... that met you in the brothel in the south of France.
He said you could do more tricks than a conjuror.
Oh!
The holy sister, what she's trying to say...
She says she's going to faint.
That young officer said that thanks to you... the ship missed its maneuvers, but the crew didn't miss theirs.
Now, what did he mean by that?
He was being kind.
I remember him well.
He said he wanted to go around the world... and so I let him.
I don't think
I'll stay for pudding.
Good-bye, Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
It was magical.
- No!
- Godfrey.
- Godfrey.
- She's not to go.
I won't have it.
I won't let her.
Child, are you mad?
You have the cheek of you.
Now sit down and have your dinner.
- Lunch!
- Whatever! Sit!
I don't care what she's done or who she is.
I'm that fond of her.
Are you, Godfrey?
I said sit down!
I won't say good-bye to you,
Miss O'Hare.
We still have unfinished business.
That's the last we'll see of her.
Godfrey!
Miss Grubb!
Come here to me.
Mammy, what is it?
Miss O'Hare's boat. Look.
Oh, my God!
What are we going to do?
Yeah, the police!
Miss Grubb, get the police.
Tell them Miss O'Hare...
Oh, the saints protect her this day. Ohh.
Ahoy, there!
Is there anybody onboard?
Ahoy! Is anybody there?
Oh, thank heavens.
I've been on the lake all night.
I lost my sense of direction.
Stand by for a line.
Thanks.
Can you please tow me back to Kilshannon?
My car's still there.
Where's Miss O'Hare?
Is she below?
She was on the boat with you last evening... when it left its mooring.
Yes, she, uh... she got off.
- Got off?
- Got off?
Excuse me. Would you...
If you don't mind.
Am I speaking to the man from Limerick?
A man from Limerick, yes.
Chief Inspector Kilkelly.
Well, my name is
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan... and I saw the woman who's in there... going on to Miss O'Hare's boat.
And my son saw it, and Miss Grubb saw it.
And if I know the ladies on the hill... every one of them saw it.
- Yes, I saw it.
- I saw it, too.
Well, Sergeant, could you take the ladies... somewhere comfortable where they can make a statement?
There's not room in there to swing a crippen.
I tell you this.
If Miss O'Hare wasn't on that boat when it was found... then she was drowned off of it.
"I have business to finish with you yet. "
That's what that woman said.
And now we know the sort of black business it was.
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, we don't have to get excitable.
- I'm saying...
- Madam!
This crowd has their ears cocked for every word we say.
Now, let's not be reckless.
Well, let the police walk tippy-toes all they like... but I'm going to say what's true... and I won't put a tooth in it.
My friend, the friend of all of us here...
Katherine O'Hare... is at the bottom of the lake this minute... because that woman put her there.
And God forgive me...
Miss O'Hare said she was in danger... and I wouldn't believe her.
None of us believed her, not even me.
I was a Judas.
I turned my back on her.
And now there's been a murder done.
That's true.
It's been said at last.
- Murder.
- Did she say murder?
That woman murdered Miss O'Hare.
It's true. It's true.
She murdered her.
- Murder?
- Murder?
Broken-down pier, you say.
That'll be here. Kilgarven Quay.
Three miles to the nearest village.
Are you saying that Miss O'Hare left her vessel... and walked to a place where you wouldn't meet... an ass and cart in an hour's walk?
Yes. Why not?
Why not? Why should she?
Well, it was... I told you, we... we quarreled... and she said if I didn't get off the boat, she would.
Yet you were the one who remained onboard.
I told you, it was starting to rain.
Why should I walk out into a downpour?
Why should she?
Why should Miss O'Hare walk into a downpour?
Because she was stupid, that's why.
Was stupid, Mrs. Broome?
I... I was talking about yesterday.
But you do admit that when you went aboard the vessel... it was you who untied the mooring ropes.
I wanted to talk to her.
On a boat, a person can't very well walk away.
Right. Right over there.
That's it.
Bring the boats in, lads!
By God,
I think they've found her.
This bag and its contents... were found in the water off Kilgarven Quay.
It belongs... or belonged to Miss O'Hare.
These are her house keys.
Any idea how it came to be in the water?
She dropped it in the water as she got off the boat.
You didn't mention this previously.
Well... I forgot.
She just dropped her purse in the water... and made no attempt to retrieve it?
She was in a hurry.
She did say, "Oh, shit. "
Mrs. Broome... you are to be detained on a holding charge... of removing property, to wit, a motor cruiser... without the owner's permission.
You will be removed forthwith to Limerick Garda station... where a more serious charge may be preferred against you.
The... the door's opening.
Edwina! Edwina!
There's the murderess!
- Murderess!
- Edwina!
- Murderess!
- Edwina!
Murderess!
I was not in the least surprised... to find that the woman was a...
No, I won't say it.
But she tried to get her claws on my son.
And when poor Miss O'Hare... the Lord have mercy on her, got suspicious... well, that was her death warrant.
A woman, whom we took into our community... our homes, and our hearts.
And what was in her heart... a heart as black as it was English... but murder?
But I say to ye... in the name of our all-loving Savior... that murder will out.
Over there.
Right. Take her back, Jim.
Not much luck.
Let's move our sweep this side along the west.
Right there!
...of the murdered woman,
Miss O'Hare.
- Dear God!
- We will now proceed to sail... over the point where she was last seen.
I appreciate that since the Troubles... a good murder is hard to come by.
When one does come along... people want to make the most of it... but this is going too far.
And who the hell thinks he knows how to print a handbill?
And this woman, the lowest of the low... is charged with what?
With taking what belongs to someone else... and they call that a crime?
Ah, it isn't even a venial sin, not in this town.
And we have here today... none other than Mr. Comiskey... the Minister of Agriculture... representing the Minister of Justice... and still the police take no action.
They want, if you please, to find a dead body.
Yeah, a body.
Well, all I can say is they're very particular.
Good woman yourself!
Well, the people of Kilshannon demand justice.
Now you're talking!
We... we have had 700 years of English tyranny... and now let this meeting demand... the rope be on the other neck for a change.
Thank you, Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
And now let us say a decade of the Rosary... for the repose of the soul of a woman... who was a saint when she was with us... and, alas, is now a saint in earnest.
I take it there are no objections... from the committee... given the nonsacred nature of our surroundings.
- None at all, Canon.
- Fire away, fire away.
Mrs. Colgan?
One of the sorrowful mysteries.
- Mrs. Purdieu?
- By all means.
- Mrs. Lawless?
- Yes, yes, of course.
Miss O'Hare.
Miss O'Hare!
Oh, don't mind me.
Water. Get some water.
No. Power's Gold Label.
Such an aggravating young woman
I never met.
She came on to my boat and shanghaied me.
Now there's the town she knows something about.
She carried on about me making a show of her... in front of the Doyle-Counihans... and all belonging to them.
God almighty, for a strap of an Englishwoman... she'd talk the hind leg off a donkey.
So by the time we got to Kilgarven Quay...
I... I was so moidered...
- That you went ashore.
- I did.
I walked two miles in the pours of rain.
A cart from the creamery at Portumna gave me a lift... to my cousin Maggie's house at Terryglass... and it was the best day's outing
I ever had.
I'm going to live with her.
And why wouldn't I?
She's a widow and by herself, the same as I am.
I only came back to sell the boat... and pack up me bits and pieces... and look at the commotion
I've walked into.
Ha! They're gone... and sorra a body will shed a tear.
That Miss O'Hare...
I don't know.
I gave that woman... so much of me heart's blood over the years.
I'm glad to see the back of her.
And as for the other rip...
Did she turn you against women, son?
Only against her, Mammy.
Do you know, she actually asked me to go back to work.
Go along with you.
Pardon me.
Will you see Gaffney the lawyer?
I'm sure she will.
And it's Mr. Gaffney, by the way.
Do tell me.
And to what, Mr. Gaffney, do I owe the...
Pleasure, ma'am?
No pleasure at all.
Alas, business rather.
The business of
Mrs. Gaffney's new fur coat.
The man has drink took.
He has, yes, and will again shortly.
However, I was alluding, ma'am, to the prosperous time ahead.
To get to the nub of the matter,
I am instructed by my client... known to you as Mrs. Edwina Broome... to take action against yourself... the Reverend Canon Murtagh... and the ladies of your committee... singly and en masse... on the grounds of slander and criminal libel.
You what?
Now, now. Forgive me.
Did you and the ladies of Widows' Peak... not call my client a murderess?
Did you not give interviews to the papers?
Did you not personally print handbills... accusing her of a crime... that carries with it a sentence of death?
No. Those handbills were Maddie O'Hara.
No. All I did was...
Put her up to it.
Yes, I have that.
Dear me, it seems as if all of you conspired... to put a rope around my client's neck.
Having called the tune, you must pay the piper.
We'll do nothing of the sort.
The brazen nerve of her.
A woman that's a mockery to her s-e-x.
No better than a common...
I wouldn't repeat that if I were you... seeing as we only have
Miss O'Hare's word for it.
It's called hearsay... and, in any case, the judge will rule as inadmissible... any attack on my client's character.
The judge?
Oh, my God.
It's a good job you're comfortably off...
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
At least, unlike the other ladies... you will have a penny or two left.
Oh... oh, the rip.
Oh, the rip!
How dare she? Oh!
Now, now, now, woman.
None of your ullagoning.
You ought to go down on your benders and give thanks.
Haven't you a treasure that neither the plaintiff... nor any woman can take from you?
A treasure?
To be sure you have... the love of a good son.
Hasn't she, Master Godfrey?
Aye, a boy's affection for his mother.
All else will fade, but never that.
Godfrey!
Godfrey!
Godfrey!
Bye-bye, Mammy!
I'm free!
I'm free!
Help!
Help!
Help!
# The blue of her eyes
# And the gold of her hair
# Are a blend of the western sky...
Mrs. Clancy.
Yes, Mr. Clancy.
Time for dinner, Mrs. Clancy.
# She's the sweetheart
# of Sigma Chi
Ready for dinner, dear?
Oh...
Ah, lamb, what is it?
I told her. I warned her.
Gin will do it every time.
Oh, be quiet.
But what's wrong?
I just remembered when you told everyone... that the baby died of scarlet fever.
I actually believed it, and I still do.
Oh, no.
That's because I'm Irish, lovey.
We can never resist a nice sad story.
And don't remind me about Kilshannon.
It's on my conscience.
Why on earth should it be?
There are times... not all the time, sometimes... when I feel we were a bit hard on them.
Well, they were a bit hard on us... weren't they, Mother... thirty years ago?

''From Arthur Kahn to Tom Sanders.
''Product Name: Arcamax CD-ROM.
''Considering the merger, I thought you should get this at home:
''Arcamax production lines running at 29% despite all efforts.
''Spot-checks on dada dada....
''Speaking of the merger, are you rich and famous yet?
''Congratulations in advance on your promotion.
''Arthur.''
Dad, you got E-mail.
I'm not a pain in the ass,
I'm being a lawyer.
There's a difference.
No more computer games, Matt, it's time for school. Eliza, where are you?
You got E-mail.
Tom, Matt's got toothpaste all over himself!
If you can't get them ready for school, don't say you'll do it.
You're welcome.
I'm here.
-And Liza needs a jacket.
-I know she needs a jacket!
A jacket doesn't go, dad.
Wear a sweatshirt.
That's for girls, a white sweatshirt.
Since when?
Leave me alone.
Put your jacket on.
Ariel doesn't have a father.
She has two mothers.
That's interesting.
He's in a hotel with his secretary patched in from New York...
...while I'm brushing Cheerios from my file folders.
It's insanity.
Put your jacket on.
Put this on, sweetie.
You can take it off at school.
Listen to your mom.
Matt, did you pee?
I don't know why you said you'd help me today, with your promotion.
What's dad got around his neck?
You don't know what this is?
It's a tie.
Dad's getting a promotion.
-Dad, you got an E-mail.
-Thanks, honey. Let's go.
We're late.
Did you get the Disneyland tickets?
With everything I have to do?
It's just one call.
Who are they for?
Mohammed Jafar. He's foreman of the Malaysian plant.
You're the one person I know who sucks up to the people below you.
Matt, don't kick the seat.
-What's on your tie?
-Toothpaste.
-Let's go.
-Your tie shouldn't look like a bib.
Hi, Cindy, what's up?
Garvin came by the office this morning?
About the promotion?
Matt, will you stop that?
He was surprised I was late?
What does that mean?
Did he say it in passing, or like he really meant it?
I wonder why Garvin came by the office at 8 in the morning?
To congratulate you.
He treats everyone like dirt--
Except the top guys.
Except the top guys.
When this merger with
Conley-White goes through...
...and they spin off our division...
...we're going to be rich.
We're already rich.
No, I mean...
...really rich.
My grandmother used to say:
''Don't climb up there too close to God, He might shake the tree.''
Tom!
Thanks for this morning.
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.
Remember lugging the first ones around?
People were amazed. It was like showing a Polaroid to a bushman.
Now, if it's bigger than a credit card, it's too inconvenient.
Keeps you on your toes.
Eddie, it's Tom. Cindy said you called.
Sure, I can hold.
How's the job search?
28 years at lBM. Did I tell you what they told me?
I was ''surplussed.''
Ever hear that word?
What's going on down there?
What? That's crazy.
They should've said, ''sodomized.''
They're not going to sell the
Austin plant. That's just a rumor.
You don't see it coming. You go along, and then one day there's no room.
No more room for you.
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.
I won't mention names. I'm just telling you, it's not true. It's a rumor.
I was making 150 a year. Big money.
It's probably what you make, huh?
Hang on.
Why don't you call Cindy...
...make an appointment.
I'll see if I can help.
Eddie, they are not going to sell Austin.
If I'm telling you, who else are you going to believe?
Cindy.
Pretty name.
Used to have fun with the girls.
Nowadays they want your job.
Good morning.
-What did Garvin say? Should I see him?
-He didn't say.
He growled.
He was flirting. Did you get Arthur?
He's standing by on the DVL.
Lunch with Conley-White is at noon.
We'll probably have those sandwiches with the crusts cut off.
Their jaws were wired shut at the same prep school.
The merger's still happening?
You heard something?
No.
Just, I....
What's on your tie?
Garvin didn't mention my promotion?
You said you'd be early today.
People from ''Father of the Year'' didn't call?
No.
That's a joke.
5 seconds to Malaysia.
Should I close the door?
Do I ever ask that?
Never.
Malaysian video linkup.
You look good. Awake.
What's wrong with Arcamax?
The drives are very slow. We're getting seek times in the 140-160 range.
140 isn't a sexy CD player anymore.
Everyone has 140.
My guys think there's a compatibility problem...
...between the controller chip and the driver's software.
That'll put us back a year.
The screen flickers. The current cuts in and out. It's a design problem.
What do you mean?
All laptops have the same design.
I sent you out some drives.
You should get them today.
This is bad, Arthur.
How could this happen?
Going to bury it until the merger?
Don't you say anything.
Does anyone else know?
I'm a grave. What, are you kidding, Tom?
I still think, really, that
Arcamax will be a major, major hit.
I'll call you when I see the drives.
Did you get the macadamia nuts?
Good night, Arthur.
They are so good.
He's off the phone. I got to go.
Do you know a Meredith Johnson?
-Yes, years ago.
-She wanted to see you.
She's here for the lunch.
The entire company came for this lunch?
Garvin brought up the Operations Group.
Meredith is in Operations?
What should I tell her?
Bad day, in-laws in town?
I'm going to see Lewyn about the 900s. Stop worrying.
If there was bad news Garvin would've sent Phil Blackburn.
Phil.
Are you coming to see me?
No. Why?
Nothing. How are you?
How are you, Tom?
You look all beat up.
I do?
You're letting it get to you.
Don't take it personally.
Take what personally?
Maybe it's just a rumor.
What's a rumor?
I don't want to spread rumors.
That's how these things get started.
You mean Austin?
Who said that?
What am I missing?
I can't believe he didn't tell you.
He's so perverse.
Tell me what?
So, how's Susan?
Susan's good.
-How's Lonnie?
-Great.
-Did you know she got tenure?
-That's great.
Here's my stop.
I tried to explain to Garvin.
You know him, he's like a child.
Fuck your feelings if they interfere with his surprise.
-What surprise?
-Rumor is you're getting passed over.
So I'm not getting the VP job?
That's the rumor.
Rumors are always true.
Garvin didn't say anything?
Came by the office. I was late,
Susan had a conference.
-You were late? Today?
-Why're you in Seattle?
Good to see you again.
Somebody tells Garvin I was talking to you.... You know how he is about leaks.
Leak? I thought it was a rumor.
It was different before.
I could watch your back.
Who gets the job, Stephanie Kaplan?
Rumor is he went outside the group.
You'd still head up Manufacturing...
...presumably.
Wait a minute.
I might be out of a job?
Don't get paranoid.
I'm a quick learner.
You wouldn't make someone VP and not let them appoint their own team.
How would that look?
Am I out of a job?
Come on, Tom.
I'm already out on a limb.
Are you okay? You want a Prozac?
No, I'm fine.
I'm disappointed, but I'm fine.
You sure?
Don't worry about me. I'm a stockholder. Whatever's...
...best for the company...
Leave a message for Susan, Tom,
Matt and Eliza, after the beep.
Thanks for calling. Bye.
-Obviously, he's disappointed.
-But he took it well?
Overall, I'd say yes.
No bumps before the merger.
I don't want him quitting.
It's up to you.
Just one big happy family.
You got that?
I have to say, going down to see him this morning was a masterstroke.
It really put him on the defensive.
I'll keep an eye on him.
He'll get on the program.
When push comes to shove, he has no guts.
Let me ask you something.
You know Susan.
If I heard a rumor about the...
...future of the company...
...my future...
...you know, nothing crazy, a real rumor...
...what would Susan say?
You think she'd say to see Garvin?
Here's someone you should meet.
Tom Sanders. He heads up Manufacturing.
Steven Chase, Crescent Capital.
John Conley.
You're John Conley?
Junior. Dad's coming on Friday with members of the Board.
-Catch you at the lunch.
-Tom, come in.
You wanted to see me.
Yeah, sorry about this morning.
You know how kids are.
Have you met Meredith Johnson?
What's wrong? That's a hello you'd give to a rash.
I'm preoccupied. It's not you.
We go way back. He broke my heart.
She's making that up.
I thought your heart was made of plastic.
He said I could be anything I wanted.
-He was right.
-It was a line.
-It wasn't a line.
-I didn't know you were acquainted.
Wilde said, ''I like a man with a future and a woman with a past.''
I heard you were in Operations.
I don't know. Am I?
The last few years I've been cleaning up the mess Bob made of this company.
If it's such a mess, why am I so rich?
Yes, but you're a lot richer now.
We should catch up. Get together.
I'd love that.
Plenty of time now.
Flying over Wyoming, I thought the merger was dead.
Conley was choking on the valuation.
The spin-off was Meredith's idea.
Conley thinks it was their idea.
-Really?
-Lit them up like a Christmas tree.
She saved the merger.
You have money now.
You can even buy a new tie.
So, what was it you wanted to see me about?
Meredith-fucking-Johnson!
Son-of-a-bitch. Goddamn Garvin.
-What happened?
-I didn't get it.
-You're not the new VP?
-He announced it?
It was a secret. He's got her installed in the office...
...bouncing quips back and forth.
Who?
-Who's she?
-Will this affect the spin-off?
She doesn't know the difference between software and a sweater.
What aren't you telling us?
I might be out of a job.
You know what it's like out there?
What about the spin-off?
They didn't tell me about me!
Would they tell me about the spin-off?!
I'm sorry.
This is the worst day of my life.
All right?
Who is she?
Let me guess: attractive?
What does that matter?
Nipples like pencil erasers?
She's attractive. Very attractive.
Sleeping with Garvin?
That's why he got a Nordic Track.
It's a curse to be me.
Life holds no surprises.
This is such a cliche.
How do you think a cliche becomes a cliche?
You mean like, ''Size doesn't matter''?
I have a thing for you.
All right, please, can we get some work done?
We got a small problem with Arcamax.
-It's not the design.
-It's not the code.
Any woman must be twice as good as a man and work harder for less pay.
Cliche grande.
How does a cliche become one?
It is very weird. We know nothing about this woman.
I do.
I had a thing with her.
You are amazing.
It was years ago.
You've seen more ass than a rental car.
Get a few more women in your life so you can be a census.
Maybe you can sleep your way up.
Right.
Wait, why? Why her and not Tom?
He's not attractive?
Men and women are different.
Not in a way that matters to you.
Are you saying I'm a virgin?
Meanwhile, you were asking me about the spin-off.
Garvin said it was her idea.
It's always such a pleasure to come here...
...and be with the
Advanced Products Group.
I feel such a warmth for the people here.
I feel a kinship. And I've always wanted to give you...
Is this seat taken?
...the most advanced original leadership that I could.
How are you?
-Sorry you didn't get the promotion.
-I'm sorry you didn't get it either.
How long have you known?
Really? That long?
Every time I've wanted to promote a woman...
...to break the glass ceiling...
...it's always the same story:
''But, Bob.... But, Bob....''
I've thought about it often since my daughter's death, that had she lived...
...it would be extremely rare...
...that she ever got to run a company.
So it has a special meaning for me when I tell you...
...that when we announce the merger...
...we will also announce the new VP for Advanced Operations and Planning...
...in Seattle...
...will be Meredith Johnson.
Unbelievable.
Thanks, Bob. Can I have the lights?
The Advanced Products Group has been the heart of DigiCom for the last 10 years.
Advanced Products has historically consisted of 4 divisions:
You seem to be spending more time up here.
My son's a freshman at the university.
This way I get to see more of him.
I thought it had to do with the merger.
This merger means everything to Garvin.
Give a man a $100 million and you create a frustrated billionaire.
The new compression algorithms will shift industry standards...
...to full-res digitized video at 60 fields a second...
...with platform-independent
RlSC processors supported by...
...a 32-bit color-active...
Conley's a conservative company.
Is Meredith conservative?
I don't know.
I thought you knew her.
Is there anything you don't know?
We offer, through technology...
...what religion and revolution have promised but never delivered:
Freedom from the physical body.
Freedom from race and gender...
...from nationality and personality, from place and time.
Communicating by cellular phone and hand-held computer...
...PDA and built-in fax modem...
...we can relate to each other as pure consciousness.
Smart, touching base with all the division heads.
She didn't name them in her speech.
Does it mean something?
Only if she plans to make changes.
Phil said she wasn't planning on making any changes.
You know Meredith.
Wait a minute.
I must know, am I out of a job?
What was she bending your ear about?
Stephanie? Nothing. Just small talk.
What, all of a sudden there's Stephanie Lite?
She was talking about her son at the university.
Sorry I didn't get to mention you.
That's fine.
I'm jammed all day but why don't you come up at 7?
We'll have a drink and catch up on business.
Great.
I remember how you liked a good bottle of wine. I'll get one.
What's she want to see you at 7 about?
Probably the Arcamax problems. We must discuss it before Conley asks questions.
She doesn't give you a boner?
Because, you know,
I definitely have lift-off.
What about you? You got a woody?
She's very nice.
-I'll let you know what happens.
-Don't do that.
You have a sexual urge every
20 minutes. It's a physical certainty.
It's hard-wired into your brain.
You can't fight it. Why would you want to? Live a little.
Ten years from now you'll need a forklift to get a hard on.
I'll call you.
I'll count the minutes.
Where've you been all day?
I didn't get it.
No, they went outside the division.
Someone from Operations.
What can I say? I got passed over.
What can I say?
So, did you get the tickets for Disneyland?
No, I know, but I promised the guy and it's...
Mohammed Jafar.
Thanks a lot. Probably won't be home for dinner tonight.
I love you too. Bye.
Are there any asset sale triggers?
In the indenture?
Will you do me a favor?
Alan, Brown will go 250 on this, easy.
Let's just do this thing.
Not a bad idea for a girl.
Let's talk first thing.
'91 Pahlmeyer.
I've looked all over for it.
I like all the boys under me to be happy.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I brought the files up for
Arcamax if you want to see them.
Show me your pictures.
The diagrams?
Your family. You have pictures?
Yeah, sure.
Here's.... Here.
That's Matthew.
That's Eliza at Halloween.
And here's Susan with the kids.
She looks like she always has food in the refrigerator.
-She never lost the baby weight--
-She doesn't look like a refrigerator.
I mean, she's made a home for you.
In my fridge I've got some champagne and an orange.
Doesn't Eliza look pretty?
She looks like Susan.
It can be inhibiting.
-What's that?
-Domesticity.
You'd be surprised.
You can't jump her from behind...
...because you get excited by the way she bends to pick up the soap.
Remember that?
I remember that.
And you miss it.
There's compensations.
Of course. Life's a series of trade-offs.
I wouldn't trade what I have.
I wouldn't want you to.
That's exactly why I can trust you.
You have more to lose than I do.
I'll bring you up to speed on the problems with the drives.
You kept in good shape, Tom.
Nice and hard.
Thank you.
It's different now.
You're my boss.
It's different.
Okay.
Rub my shoulders and I'll listen to your problems.
The specs and the seek times call for 100 milliseconds.
We have that on the prototypes.
But the drives coming off-line--
-Are the drives here?
-It might be a chip.
-Answer my question.
-I'm trying to.
Understand the controller chip positions the split optics.
I'll show you the schematic.
No, no, no, no. Rub.
You can't understand the problem--
-Do you have the drives?
-Arthur sent 5--
-I said no calls.
-It's Mr. Garvin.
But after that, nobody.
Is it all right if I leave for the day?
That's fine, Mrs. Ross.
You'd rather talk about other things...
...than answer my question because you don't know.
You don't know what the problem is.
But you can't say, ''I don't know''...
...because in your mind that means you lose. You're worthless. Men!
-What will you tell Conley?
-I can't lie to them.
Talk about the prototypes. They work.
Focus on the positive.
We're on-line. It's not about the prototypes.
-They want to know if you can build it.
-I understand that--
Do you have a problem working for me?
No.
Hi, Bob.
You don't want to hear about my hard day.
Yes, that's hard work.
Let me get my docs together.
The merger is about people, not Arcamax.
They're comfortable with me and Bob.
This isn't about some CD-ROM that'll be obsolete in a year.
If they ask, then you tell them you don't know.
Hi, Bob, I'm here.
I've got a great idea about that.
Go ahead.
Lewyn, this is Sanders.
I've discussed the drives with Meredith.
She says don't tell the Conley people...
...until we know exactly what the problems are.
That is the line for the 8 a.m. meeting tomorrow--
Let's get down to business.
Wait a sec, wait a sec.
Meredith, wait a second.
-There, was that so bad?
-That's not so bad, it's just--
Come on, while there's still a chance we might get caught.
No, no.
Oh, yes, I think so.
Some things never change, and some things just get better.
Meredith, come on.
-Remember all the things we did?
-I remember.
Things nobody knows about you but me.
All our secrets.
Just lie back and let me take you.
I could have anybody and I picked you.
Now you've got all the power.
You've got something I want.
Doesn't that make you feel good?
Don't stop me. Come on.
Don't worry, I'm not going to bite.
Let me do whatever I want.
You just lie back and let me be the boss.
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait a minute.
What?
Look, nobody has to know.
Nobody gets hurt.
It's just a meeting between two colleagues.
Just another dull day in the computer business.
No, honey.
Don't!
Here.
-Want to get fucked?
-Do it.
Is that what you want?
Come on.
Is that what you want?
You just stay hard.
Oh, God.
You bad boy.
Come on, baby.
Come on. You going to fuck me?
You going to fuck me?!
Put it in.
God, look at us.
Go inside me.
Come on.
-I can't do this.
-Do it.
I won't.
Now!
-I'm not going to do this!
-Now!
You can't just stop!
-Come on.
-No! Goddamn!
You stick your dick in my mouth then get an attack of morality?
This never happened.
You never used to be this way.
I have a family now.
A family made you stupid.
You take those two champagne bottles in your refrigerator...
...and fuck them.
You son-of-a-bitch.
You get back here and finish what you started.
You hear me?
Do you?
Come back and finish what you started or you are dead!
You are fucking dead!
Shit, it's dead.
You are hereby notified that we will hold your client liable--
I didn't hear you come in.
I'm going to take a shower.
-No kiss?
-I just feel kind of shitty, you know.
Screw them.
-They don't deserve you.
-Can you get me a beer?
Thanks. Before I forget, could you do me a favor?
The cellular's battery's dead.
Sure. I thought they were supposed to last all day?
I thought so.
Who's Meredith Johnson?
What?
Meredith Johnson.
She called just before you got home.
She called?
Yeah, about 10 minutes ago.
She said the 8 a.m. had been pushed back to 8:30.
-Who is she?
-She's the one, the new VP.
She's the one?
She came from the Valley.
How old is she?
I don't know. 33, maybe.
That's young for that job.
-Had you ever heard of her?
-She's a face guy.
She made the merger happen. Now she's Garvin's fair-haired...whatever.
Where'd she come from?
Has she any technical background?
No. That's the thing with the merger.
Everything's changed.
That's not the worst thing in the world.
She'll crash and burn.
Then they'll appreciate you.
Things aren't easy out there.
So quit...
...rather than let them treat you badly.
We might lose everything, including the stock options.
I don't care about stock options.
I'll work full-time.
I'm capable of supporting our family.
Just trying to help.
You're too nice sometimes.
I don't need you to fight my battles for me, thanks.
Right now some lucky girl in the building will come after me.
I deserve that, but ask yourself...
...why does a man go with another girl? He's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely.
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?
You never do.
I don't know. Just a little cold.
What are you going to do?
Grin and bear it, like I usually do.
And hope it doesn't get worse.
Morning.
Morning, Bob.
That's a nice suit.
Nice fabric.
Can I feel it?
What is that? Wool?
With a little bit of viscose.
That's what makes the pants drape so well.
You work out?
When I get a chance, Bob.
It's been busy lately.
I've always liked you.
Now you have the power.
You have something I want.
Come on.
The computer takes the information from the database...
...and constructs an environment that is projected in the headset.
When the user walks on the pad, he or she...
...feels like they're walking in a hall with drawers of files on all sides.
The user can stop, open any file...
...and look at the data. The laser scanners are for body representation.
-That's amazing.
-It's cool, isn't it?
Where is everyone?
They left 15 minutes ago.
Don Cherry's demo-ing the Corridor.
The meeting's at 8:30.
No, 7:30. It got pushed up.
Nobody told you?
If someone wants to log on with a regular computer, what they'll see...
...is a model of themselves with a photo that's pulled up from a data file.
Hey, I know you.
The photo bears some resemblance to me, I admit.
An inside joke here at the company.
We've also constructed virtual help.
Users always need on-line help.
We created an angel to help you.
Welcome to the Corridor.
The same face.
Angel...
...how do I open this drawer?
What's the angel saying?
That's between them.
We don't see the Corridor as a product in the marketplace now.
This is something that we worked up to demonstrate the potential...
...of virtual reality technology.
This looks good.
Hold on. What's that?
I believe it's your financial records.
Turn that damn thing off.
Sorry.
In the final system there will be safeguards that will control access.
So glad you could join us.
That was a sweet entrance, my friend.
Did the ferry hit an iceberg? You were going to call me after meeting Meredith.
I called you from her office.
Left a message.
There was nothing on my machine.
Then you're late again.
Thank God Meredith led the discussion.
Hey, pal, I left a message on your machine, all right?
Check it out.
Did you get my message?
You told Susan the meeting had been moved to 8:30.
I said 7:30. If your wife can't take a fucking message, get a machine.
-There you go, Mr. Sanders.
-Thank you.
You're welcome.
Full house today.
Meredith has been getting us up to speed on the Arcamax.
We'd like your read on it.
Meredith said there are problems.
You might have to go back to the drawing board.
I'm sorry if I conveyed that impression to Meredith.
I'm convinced we can manufacture them.
How many of the drives meet specs?
I don't have that information with me.
Meredith told us the line is running at 29%. Is that approximately right?
The seek times are off-specs.
There's a power flicker in the screen?
-Right?
-That's right.
With the merger impending, shouldn't you have told someone?
The merger isn't about a CD-ROM that might be obsolete in a year.
It's about people.
-It'll be obsolete in a year?
-The promise of the Arcamax...
...was a central factor in this merger.
I may be at fault. Tom said the problem with the drives was serious.
Not so serious.
Don't cover up.
-I'm not covering anything up.
-Give us worst case.
We go back to the drawing boards and we're down for 9 months.
Nine months?
Meredith said 6 weeks.
Nobody likes to go back to the board, but it can be an advantage.
Is there a problem?
This isn't an inquisition.
I feel like I'm pulling teeth.
John just wants to get a handle on what the problems are with the lines.
-I don't know is the honest answer.
-Wait a minute.
You are head of Manufacturing.
You are in charge of Arcamax.
There are problems with it...
...that could take 9 months to fix, which I assume means a year.
And the bottom line is...
...you don't know?
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
Jesus Christ!
I wanted to see you. It's not going to work out with Meredith.
-Evidently not.
-She set me up.
I saw.
-She set me up.
-Sit down.
-Why? What'd I do?
-Please, would you just sit.
Meredith told me about your meeting last night.
What?
What'd she say?
She wants to handle the intervention internally, which is best.
-She still cares about you.
-Wait a minute.
What'd she say?
Not to put too fine a point on it, she said you sexually harassed her.
I sexually harassed her?
-What would you call it?
-She jumped me.
She jumped you? You're in denial.
That's typical.
She almost raped me.
You need help. You must accept responsibility for--
What about this?
What about that?
Looks like she defended herself.
Defended herself? The woman can kick the shit out of both of us!
-It may have seemed different to you.
-I didn't harass her.
She harassed me.
I've never heard of a woman harassing a man.
Why're you here?
-I'm here as your friend.
-My ass, you're my friend.
When Garvin finds out about this, he'll want to throw you out on your ass.
Let's keep this quiet.
That's what Meredith wants too.
Resolve this quickly and quietly.
Want your wife to find out?
We'll have to tell her at some point.
They'll get the whole thing and it'll be on the front page of the paper!
I'm offering you a chance to make a new life.
Keep your family out of this mess.
Keep your job.
Obviously, some kind of lateral move.
When you say lateral, you mean out of the division.
You can't stay here.
She's scared out of her wits.
I'm not leaving this division. I spent
10 years here. I built this place.
Now, we got a spin-off going on--
We're thinking, you know, Austin.
Austin?
I told him what she said.
He said the opposite happened.
He said she harassed him.
What?
He denies it?
You know, the man always denies it.
Is he crazy?
I offered him a move to Austin.
To Austin. That's like a duck making a lateral move to ''à l'orange.''
He's too smart for that.
Let's hope he's smart enough to see he has no options.
Take care of this.
This is a bomb we're sitting on that can blow everything sky-high.
Meredith is key to the merger. I can't have her involved in a sex scandal.
And I won't say good-bye to
$100 million. You got that?
I get the picture, Bob.
10th floor. Down the hall and right.
There were no witnesses?
Her assistant left earlier in the night.
A cleaning lady was outside the office.
I don't know what she heard.
-Did you report that to anyone?
-In the morning, yeah.
What was the company's response?
They believed her.
They suggested I transfer to Austin.
I heard they're selling Austin.
The point is, if I go to Austin,
I lose everything, all right?
My stock options, everything that I worked for.
Did you call anyone after the incident?
No.
Did you tell your wife?
Oh, boy.
Why not?
I didn't want to upset her. I felt guilty being in that situation at all.
How would you characterize
Miss Johnson physically?
She's very pretty. She was
Miss Teenage New Mexico.
So you kissed.
Yes. And then she began to...rub me.
Rub you where?
You know....
Your penis?
Yes.
And?
I'm uncomfortable talking about it.
-Because I'm a woman?
-You act like it's a game.
-Why are you here?
-I want to know what my options are.
What your options are?
I want to know whether I can sue her for sexual harassment.
To do that you must convince a jury...
...you were alone with Miss Teenage
New Mexico and you said, ''no.''
Sexual harassment...
...is not about sex.
It is about power.
She has it...
...you don't.
If you sue, you'll never get another job in computers.
If you don't, you'll go to Austin. Sue, and it's news. Don't sue, it's gossip.
If you sue, no one will believe you.
If you don't, your wife won't.
They'll make your life hell for the
3 years until the case goes to trial.
And, for that privilege, it'll cost you a minimum of $100,000.
Do you not think it's a game, Mr. Sanders?
It's a game to them.
How do you feel about losing?
That's what Meredith wants.
To resolve it, quickly and quietly.
They said she's not going to press charges. Why?
She's accused me. Why stop there?
Why not press charges?
Meredith didn't press charges...
...because she couldn't.
DigiCom is planning a merger with Conley-White.
It is supposed to happen Friday.
They think that we are as conservative as they are.
With a scandal, Conley goes to bed with
Katie Couric, wakes up to Jessica Hahn.
Garvin is out $100 million.
I think we might make a plaintiff out of this guy yet.
No, a potential plaintiff. I don't have to sue. I just threaten to sue.
That's a dangerous game.
Are you willing to play it?
Fuck them.
Now you're talking my language.
For the next 3 days...
...this loose cannon is in a position to apply a lot of pressure.
And they on you, Mr. Sanders.
They on you.
Call security. Throw him out on the sidewalk.
We have to appear to be impartial.
Keep him in his job, keep paying him, no hassles.
I made Tom Sanders.
Who the hell is he to sue me?
Sexual harassment, under Title Seven.
He'll file with the Human Rights
Commission if we don't fire Meredith.
If he files, it becomes public.
It'd blow the deal.
We realize that. So does he.
He's blackmailing us.
This is America, goddamn it.
The legal system is supposed to protect people like me.
It gets worse.
His lawyer is...
...Catherine Alvarez.
Great. She'd change her name to ''TV
Listings'' just to get it in the paper.
I'm trying to get them to mediate.
Keep it quiet.
Mediate?
I want you to cut his balls off.
Did he say mediate or split the difference?
I'm just hoping he'll agree.
Alvarez will tell him not to.
He'll agree.
He doesn't want this public.
We pushed him too hard.
He has nothing to lose.
Really? He hasn't told his wife yet.
How do you know?
I know Sanders, remember?
He likes secrets.
-I'll be in diagnostics.
-Where were you?
They're pulling the drives apart.
-John Levin called.
-John Levin with Sematach?
He said it's important.
-Why didn't they come this morning?
-Susan called about the benefit.
-Call her and say--
-She said don't try to cancel.
-The Lewyns paid for the tickets.
-I'll be there at 7:30.
Ask her to bring me a shirt and jacket.
Is everything okay?
Everything is fine, thanks for asking.
I'll kill Arthur.
We must solve this before Friday and you just got the drives?!
What is Arthur doing over there?
All he does anymore is give macadamia nuts to people.
Is he a manager or a stewardess?
-He gave you nuts?
-What's slowing it down?
Over here.
Let me show you something.
Arthur was right.
There's a compatibility problem with the controller chip.
Is it a bug?
Don Cherry debugged Arcamax.
There are no bugs.
Fabrication problem?
What're you doing?
This is a sophisticated piece of electronics, not a pickup truck.
How bad is it? We have 4,000 of these. Should I junk them all?
I told Arthur to send 10 in heat-sealed plastic bags. It's a hunch I have.
Do what you can.
I don't understand it.
In prototypes, no problem.
In manufacturing, it falls apart.
Mr. Garvin wants to see you.
He said not to tell anyone.
Catherine Alvarez on two.
Thanks. Could you close the door?
How are you?
Let's agree to mediate.
I don't want this getting out either.
If we get this all over in a week, my wife needn't know.
I do not want to tell my wife. I don't want to upset her if I don't have to.
Wait a second.
Guess what?
They locked me out of my computer and cleaned out my files.
I guess it's starting.
Come in.
I'm not interrupting?
No, not at all.
Going down?
Don't tell me you're scared of me.
I don't want it to be this way.
Yeah, we could be fucking right now.
-I think of you as a friend.
-Oh, come off it!
You called Blackburn--
Only to beat you to the punch.
I knew you'd play that card.
I wasn't playing a card.
You were the one that--
Alarm.
This isn't a game.
You'd have a great job, the spin-off would make you a millionaire.
We'd have fun.
It's not like breaking rocks.
You don't get it.
Poor Sanders. You have no idea what you're up against.
As usual.
By this time tomorrow you'll wish you took the Austin job.
We'll see.
We'll see.
I'm trying to figure out whether to get a fat Barbie for Eliza.
Mattel makes a fat Barbie?
It's called ''Happy to Be Me Barbie.''
Does she come with the
''Happy to Be Divorced Ken''?
I'm serious.
Which is more stigmatizing?
Yeah, Barbie's stigmatized.
It's that whole male,
36-24-36 image of beauty.
Women are oppressed.
Women are oppressed?!
80% of suicides are committed by men.
They're dropping from heart attacks.
-You're not as tough.
-Sorry. We're just fighting the wars.
You start the wars.
I'm sorry. I don't have my own crisis hot line.
-You're taking the Meredith thing well.
-That has nothing to do with it.
What was today's rumor?
She was once a man?
Just tell her.
Tell her what?
Tell her a lot of us have worked as hard as you...
...and you're blowing this merger for all of us because you fucked up.
What happened?
Who got to you?
It's not that simple.
The thought of losing millions happens to stick right here in my throat.
This was my big shot. It's not like I'm being scouted by the NBA.
What happened?
Who knows? An old girlfriend, a bottle of wine, a late meeting...
-Fill in the blanks.
-Thanks.
You're like women who think they're in the hotel room, drunk, to watch TV.
Could you possibly be more lame?
For your information, Mark,
Tom told me everything.
Everything that happened.
And I support him 100%.
That is so sweet, but I don't think--
Let's not discuss it.
Let's just enjoy the evening.
Obviously, something happened.
Did you have sex?
-Think first. Because if you're lying--
-No, I said, no.
She kissed me, and she unzipped my pants, and-and-and-and-and--
And?
And that was it.
How did it get that far?
-You think I encouraged her?
-Her hand was in your pants?
-Nothing happened.
-How did that happen?
Then she accuses me of sexual harassment--
-She harassed you?
-You don't believe me?
Mark doesn't believe you.
He's got stock options on the brain.
He's back-stabbing.
Everybody's sure you're having an affair with Cindy.
-We're not having an affair.
-How could you let this happen?
-Nothing happened.
-Something happened.
She's an old girlfriend of yours.
Like I'm surprised. That club's as exclusive as the white pages.
-I was going to tell you.
-I can't believe everyone knew but me.
-Nobody knows it.
-You're so naive. Of course they know.
I'm old-fashioned. I greet my inferiors with a handshake.
I'll handle it.
Jesus.
What does she look like?
She's attractive.
One to ten.
Eight.
Nine.
What does the company say?
They want me to transfer to
Austin, do some therapy.
Austin?
I'm not moving there.
We're not moving to Austin.
-I'm pressing charges.
-For what?
Sexual harassment.
We have a mediation tomorrow.
When were you going to tell me?
That's brilliant.
Show up without your wife.
-I'll handle it.
-Are you crazy? They'll destroy you.
-It won't go that far.
-It'll take over our life.
Depositions and whispering and legal fees for some damn personal vindication.
And all people remember is that you were involved in something sleazy.
-Do you have a lawyer?
-Catherine Alvarez.
Great. When are we on Hard Copy?
But if it had happened to you--
You know how many times it's happened to me?
-You never said this ever happened--
-You're so narcissistic.
Nothing happens until it happens to you.
-You should've said something.
-I do what women always do.
I deal with it. Now go in there tomorrow and work it out.
Right. I should shut up and fuck her.
Apologize and get your job back.
Apologize?!
The children are sleeping.
Wait, I got a better idea.
Why don't I just admit it?
I'll be the evil male you all complain about. Then I can fuck everybody.
Tom, stop it.
Come, I want to dominate you!
You're scaring her.
I have a urge!
The children!
My children that I provide for and protect.
They can come between me and my wife, move us, take my job...
...and take the house we have made! ! !
And I apologize to them, Susan?
They call me a rapist and I apologize. This is a joke.
Sexual harassment is about power.
When did I have the power?
When?
Good morning, I'm Judge Murphy.
This is a mediation.
Our proceedings are confidential.
Maintain a civil and courteous tone.
Our goal is to determine the nature of the dispute...
...and how best to resolve it.
The parties have agreed that
Mr. Sanders will speak first...
...and be cross-examined by Mr. Heller.
Ms. Johnson will speak next, and be cross-examined by Ms. Alvarez.
Any questions?
Let's get started.
I had my cellular phone with me, so when she called Garvin...
...I called Mark Lewyn to give him the upshot of our meeting.
Then she approached you?
Correct. She took the phone from me and she kissed me.
Where?
She kissed me in my ear...
...on my neck...
...on my mouth.
She put her tongue in my mouth.
When you asked her to stop, did she?
No, no.
She unzipped my pants...
...and massaged my penis.
-Were you aroused?
-Yes.
Then she slid down...
...and she...
...put my penis in her mouth.
Did you climax?
I grabbed her by the wrists.
I threw her on the ground.
Then I wanted to leave.
Then what did Ms. Johnson do?
She threatened me.
She said, ''You're dead.''
And then, the next day,
Mr. Blackburn told me that...
...she said that I had sexually harassed her.
Mr. Heller?
-Mr. Sanders, would you like a break?
-No, I'm fine.
You say the bottle of wine was Ms. Johnson's idea?
Yes.
But when you were living with Ms. Johnson...
...didn't you discover wines together on trips to the Napa Valley?
Yes.
Romantic trips?
Yes.
But you didn't expect any romance in her office?
Did you have a conversation after lunch about how...
...seeing Meredith gave you a...
...boner?
Someone else said that. lsn't the term ''boner'' a slang for erection?
You had a conversation about...
...having an erection? A boner?
Yes, but I didn't say it.
But you laughed.
Yes.
So you condone it.
It was harmless.
If it's harmless...
...why are we here today?
Well, it was just...
...what guys talk about.
About their boners?
Not generally, no.
Yet you expect us to believe that after having a sexual conversation...
...you weren't thinking of sex?
That's correct.
How would you characterize your prior relationship with Ms. Johnson?
Highly sexual?
I don't know how to rate it.
Every day?
Sometimes twice a day.
Sex in public places.
Sodomy.
Viewing of pornography.
Vibrators and other mechanical devices.
Sometimes we sat on the couch and watched television.
But when you became reacquainted, you no longer saw her as a sexual object?
-She was just your boss now?
-That's correct.
And do you admit having an erection during your meeting?
She had her top open.
It was an involuntary reflex.
Reflex.
Do you think her gynecologist gets an erection when he examines her breast?
That's completely different.
Do you admit putting your penis in her mouth?
She did.
Oh, I forgot.
You resisted.
Mr. Sanders, during your rather fantastic testimony...
...there was one moment that rang true.
You said, and I quote:
''I was angry.
I felt I was being pushed around.''
Correct.
The truth is, you felt that way all day.
You'd been expecting a promotion and she got it. You got angry about it.
I felt I deserved the job.
You took that anger up to her office.
You'd show her who's boss.
That's not true.
Did you tell your wife about your
7 o'clock meeting with Ms. Johnson?
I had a meeting and I'd be home late.
You expected to be late?
No, but if I got home earlier my wife would be pleasantly surprised.
So you make it a rule to lie to your wife?
I didn't lie.
When you called your wife, did you tell her that...
...Ms. Johnson was a former lover of yours?
When you got home, did you tell her what happened?
No, I hoped it would go away.
You hoped you'd get away with it?
Do not debunk the illusion that this dispute might be settled amicably.
That's okay.
I have no further questions.
I asked to see pictures.
I thought if we put it on that basis...
...it would be clear that things had changed between us.
Do you have those pictures now?
I'd like copies for my file.
You can continue.
He said his wife hadn't lost all the weight gained from pregnancy.
His children were beautiful...
...but they made him feel old...
...and seeing me reminded him of what it was like to be young...
...and marriage was a tough trade-off.
Go on.
My assistant, Mrs. Ross, asked if she could go home.
I wanted her to stay, but felt guilty.
I'd kept her late for weeks preparing for my new job.
And where was Mr. Sanders at that point?
He began to rub my shoulders.
And you let him?
It was awkward...
...but I thought we'd end the meeting and leave it at that.
Then he tried to kiss you?
No, Mr. Garvin called and then I came back to Tom...
...and said that was it, and then he began to kiss me.
Did you try to stop him?
Yes. I struggled with him and told him to stop. But he didn't.
Did he attack you physically?
Yes.
He grabbed me by my hair...
...and forced me down on my knees.
And...
He put his...
...penis in your mouth?
This is making me uncomfortable.
Want some water?
Thank you.
He put his penis in my mouth...
...and said that he was going to...
To fuck you? Were those his words?
He said, ''Do you want to get fucked?''
And then he reached down and tore off my panties.
What did you do then?
He threw me down on the scaffold and I kneed him in the groin.
And that was the end of it?
It's strange. I'd think my instinct would be to run, but I became angry.
I yelled at him. Called him names.
Told him I'd kill him.
Just yelling.
How did he react?
He seemed to realize what he'd done.
He pulled up his pants and left.
Did you call anyone afterwards?
No.
I didn't know what to do.
I kept going over the day in my mind trying to figure out...
...if somehow this thing was my fault.
You reported it the next day?
Yes.
But you didn't bring formal charges. Why not?
I talked to Phil Blackburn.
I knew he was Tom's friend.
I didn't want to destroy...
...Tom's marriage or career, but it's clear we couldn't work together.
I would be too scared.
I'm scared just sitting here.
Nothing further.
Ms. Alvarez.
Ms. Johnson, I just want to be clear on one thing.
Mr. Sanders suggested the bottle of wine?
-That's right.
-But you bought it.
I sent my assistant Mrs. Ross out to buy a bottle.
That afternoon?
Did you tell her what kind?
I said to get a nice Chardonnay.
I knew Tom liked white wine.
From those trips to Napa that he was an amateur connoisseur.
He'd be impressed by a nice bottle.
Yes.
Do you remember the wine?
No.
The '91 Pahlmeyer?
That's right.
Do you know where your assistant got that wine?
I assume she got it at a liquor store.
Would it surprise you to know...
...that no liquor store in
Seattle carries that bottle?
Mrs. Ross is very resourceful.
Very resourceful?
A bottle of wine you can't find within 500 miles of Seattle.
I have no idea where she got the bottle of wine. lsn't it true, Ms. Johnson, that you told Mrs. Ross 3 weeks ago...
...that you wanted a bottle of '91 Pahlmeyer...
...for this meeting?
That's not true.
And when she couldn't find it, you said--.
What was that? It had such managerial brio.
Here it is.
''If you don't find the wine...
...find a replacement.''
Do you have testimony from Mrs. Ross?
Yes, I do.
Ms. Johnson?
The fact is Mrs. Ross has personal problems.
She has a drinking problem.
She makes up stories to make herself seem more important.
I told Mrs. Ross to go buy a bottle of wine after Tom and I spoke...
...at the luncheon.
Maybe she had that bottle at home.
Maybe in her wine cellar.
Any more questions?
No, not for now.
I think this is a good time for a break.
I got some information on Meredith.
You won't believe it, or maybe you will.
Alan gave me a list, we can't verify any of this.
-You said you didn't have sex.
-I didn't.
I didn't have sex with her.
What is it, Tom?
She's trying to quit smoking?
-It's true.
-How could you do this?
She did it. That's the point.
You saw this woman alone.
You had wine, a back rub, you kissed.
And then this non-sex sex thing.
You took off her panties.
Those are facts.
So what?
-That doesn't happen unless you want it.
-I was cornered.
-You let it happen!
-I did not!
How could you? How could you let that woman into our lives?
Get this.
Ten of her subordinates transferred in the last 5 years. All men.
What a red flag!
Can you see them?
Yeah, but no one will talk and we can't subpoena them just for a mediation.
-Do you want to have lunch?
-I must go back to work.
How about you? Are you hungry?
How are you holding up?
Are you married?
Chandler, Hogue and Alvarez.
-I married Chandler.
-You married your boss?
Classic case of sexual harassment. He asked me out 5 times before I said yes.
Today, if I had said no once, he would have been afraid to ask again.
Tom said you're a lawyer.
Ten years.
-Let's switch hats. What do you think?
-I don't look good in hats.
You're afraid she's telling the truth.
Yes.
What he did, he did out of weakness.
Hardly makes it better, does it?
I can't get in the middle of your relationship with Tom...
...but she did break the law and that makes the difference.
Ms. Alvarez, 48 hrs ago, my husband's penis was in another woman's mouth.
There's nothing in the law that'll help me deal with that.
When did these arrive?
Came in an hour ago.
Garvin had me send the Corridor to the hotel for the Conley people to use.
It's at the hotel?
Yeah. The Conley people had such fun with it yesterday...
Getting anywhere with the drives?
I'm counting on you.
-I have a hunch.
-What is it?
-I don't know.
-What is it?
I don't know.
She got to you, didn't she?
What else? They're stronger, they're smarter and they don't fight fair.
It's the next step in the human evolution.
Keep some of us for sperm and kill the rest.
What do you have?
If I know something for a fact,
I won't withhold it.
But I can't go out on a limb, it's too intense around here.
I'm 23. I can't wake up tomorrow and find I'm out of the computer business.
Why aren't you at the mediation?
I just came back to--. This was the last thing I needed this week.
Come in.
Something's come up.
I need to know exactly what happened that night.
Well, it's exactly like I told Phil.
You're not talking to Phil.
We have Sanders' phone records. It's possible someone overheard you two.
John Levin called again.
Find out what it's about.
He must talk to you personally.
I don't want to talk to him now.
Can I talk to you?
Cindy...
Are you ''a friend''?
A friend?
You know...
...''a friend.'' A friend.
I depends on what you mean by ''a friend.''
All right, never mind.
He's heading for the elevator.
Heading back to the mediation?
-Yeah, I must get back.
-I'll give you a lift.
Don't you think it's time we talked?
I understand you both had a chance to get it off your chest.
Your version of what happened.
Now I want it to stop.
What I got off my chest was not a version.
It's always a version. That's the legacy of the modern age.
We have information but no truth.
Flashes of electrons in a grain of sand.
I'm telling the truth.
-You must look at this from all sides.
-How many sides are there?
All right, let's say she made a mistake. So what?
She made a pass, that's all.
You could have decided it was flattering.
You could have handled it many ways, but this vindictiveness...
...I must say, I'm surprised.
It's against the law.
I work for her.
I'm employed by her.
No. You work for me.
That's what I'm saying.
After all these years, why didn't you come to me? Not hire this lawyer!
Maybe I should have.
I mean, why can't you just forget it?
Work together like adults and everyone makes a pile of money.
-What's wrong with that?
-It's gone too far.
Things can go back.
Why would he offer to settle now?
He realized how much they got to lose.
No, it doesn't add up.
Maybe there's a vulnerability we don't know about.
I'm still getting messages from
''a friend''. I printed out the address.
Maybe you can check it out.
I hope DigiCom doesn't find him first.
Remember the cleaning lady?
She's out of town. No one knows where or when she's coming back.
The Bahamas, probably, with
Mrs. Ross soon to join her.
These guys play hardball.
Did Mr. Sanders ever touch you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable?
He's not aware of it.
Just answer the question, please.
Yes.
How?
He'll pat me on my behind or...
...rub my shoulders.
Rub your shoulders?
I don't think he means anything by it.
You don't like it.
I just feel it's inappropriate.
I don't see the relevance of this.
We're trying to establish a pattern of behavior.
Sexual harassers generally follow a pattern.
I'll allow it.
Do you have chiropractic problems?
Any neck problems, or your back?
No.
So you would characterize this behavior as flirting...
...or sexual?
-I suppose so.
-But you never said anything.
He's my boss.
You didn't report it?
He's your boss. I understand.
Your job is at stake. Rumors.
Whether people would believe you.
And if I ask you if you ever had any sexual relations with Mr. Sanders...
...same answer?
No, I didn't.
Didn't report it?
-It never happened.
-I understand.
I have no more questions.
Barbara called...
-about the Disneyland tickets for...?
-Jafar.
He's got the tickets and an upgrade at the hotel.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
They gave me your photos.
I'll see you later?
Yes, I'll see you later.
You know...
...it's funny how you always assumed you'd get the job.
Lewyn assumed it would be him or you.
But nobody ever thought for a second it might be me. lsn't that funny?
That's not true. You were on the list.
Really?
Let me guess: ''Hunter, not someone you'd follow into battle.
A team player. No killer instinct.
Doesn't have those tools.''
What is that all a code for?
What, you on Meredith's side?
I studied engineering for eight years.
I was the only woman in the department. You know what I did?
I worked. You think
I'm on Meredith's side?
What do you want to do?
What?
Their offer ends midnight. It's what
Garvin said. You get your job back.
She's your boss.
Everyone goes back to work.
Did you find ''a friend''?
Did we get the address?
Dr. Arthur Friend, a chemistry professor from the University of Washington...
...who's been in Nepal the last three weeks.
You got messages from a locked office.
I'm glad we got that one solved.
Shit, I have to call Lewyn.
The drives we're having problems with came in.
Only you.
Anyone else would be sabotaging the company, not solving their problems.
It's Adele and Mark.
We're not home, leave a message and we'll call you back.
What?
Mark's wife's voice is on the machine, but on Monday it was a man's voice.
Then the next day Mark said he never got the message.
I dialed the wrong number that night.
So?
That's why the battery was dead.
What are you talking about?
That's why Garvin wants to deal.
He's got my phone records.
I've got a 10 minute phone bill while I'm in Meredith's office.
She took the phone away.
I called the wrong number...
...but I never hung up the phone.
The phone line is open.
Somebody's got this whole thing on an answering machine.
It's Levin, not Lewyn.
What's going on?
I've been getting phone calls.
Some creep has my Visa...
...then, at the office, everything's turned upside down.
Have they got the tape?
What I'm saying is, it's good I brought it home.
-My girlfriend and I listened to it.
-Where's the tape?
It's all here?
I've been trying to get a hold of you all week!
You know what this means?
Do you have any idea what this means?
Thanks, pal.
No deal. No, no deal, Catherine.
We're going to bury them.
Everything is on tape.
Yes, everything.
Put it in.
God, look at us.
Go inside me.
I can't do this.
-Do it.
-I won't.
Now! Come on, now!
You can't just stop! You can't!
No! Goddamn it!
You stick your dick in my mouth then get an attack of morality?
This never happened.
You never used to be this way.
In any judicial proceeding, this tape would be inadmissible.
I'm worried I'm going to drive to work and hear it on Howard Stern.
Is she threatening?
I don't know how many copies of this tape there are.
I didn't put it out there.
This tape just shows consensual sex between adults...
...however it may have appeared the next day.
Mr. Sanders' regret is not my client's harassment.
Ms. Johnson, is that your position today?
Yes, it is.
Ms. Alvarez?
Just so I'm clear on what today's story is...
...would you define for me ''consensual sex.''
Sex where both parties are willing participants.
How many times did we hear
Mr. Sanders say ''no''?
I don't know, I was busy listening to my panties being torn off.
31 times.
Doesn't ''no'' mean ''no''?
Sometimes ''no'' means that person wants to be overwhelmed, dominated.
The way we're supposed to have sex nowadays we'd need UN supervision.
''No'' means ''no.'' lsn't that what we tell women?
Do men deserve less?
When he really wanted to stop he had no problems doing it.
And you got angry.
Of course I did. Anyone would.
We tell women they can stop at any point.
Haven't you ever said
''no'' and meant ''yes''?
Until the moment of penetration--
He was willing. That tape doesn't change anything.
You controlled the meeting. You set the time, you ordered the wine.
You demanded service and got angry when he didn't provide it.
So you decided to get rid of him with this trumped-up charge.
The only thing you have proven is that a woman in power...
...can be every bit as abusive as a man.
You want to put me on trial?
Let's be honest about why.
I am sexually aggressive. I like it.
Tom knew it and you can't handle it.
It's the same thing since the beginning of time.
Veil it, hide it, lock it up and throw away the key.
We expect a woman to do a man's job, make a man's money...
...then lie down for a man to fuck her like it was 100 years ago!
Well, no, thank you.
You won't believe this. I think the Howard Stern thing got to them.
-What did Phil say?
-You get your job back.
You get $100,000 in pain and suffering, and I get fees and expenses.
Meredith?
She stays through the merger, then they say...
...she has to leave for some whatever emergency. She's out.
This is total and complete vindication.
It's over!
I almost feel sorry for him.
He has no idea, does he?
I'd like to read this over again before we sign. Not that I don't trust you.
Just as long as it's done by midnight tonight.
Garvin wants this off his screen.
We want you to make a presentation on Arcamax...
...at the merger announcement tomorrow.
Nothing technical, 4 minutes.
Fine.
Great.
Now I've got to go break it to her.
It won't be easy.
I thought you enjoyed that kind of thing.
You go after one of our people, we'll put the wagons in a circle.
Once you made your case, the company behaved appropriately.
Right?
-You don't want to know what I think.
-It's terrible.
Way a thing like this can...
...tear a company apart.
I told Bob we really need to take a look at it.
Friends?
What?
I hope you still think of me as a friend.
Good night, Phil.
Sign it now and I'll read it later.
Where will you be?
Here, working on the presentation.
If not, I'll have somebody run this by your house later.
Let me ask you something.
Why'd she do this?
You've seen her in action.
She's cool, smart and in control.
-How'd she lose control like this?
-I don't know.
You're attractive. Maybe.
-But not irresistible.
-I'm serious. She's here one day.
There's a merger going on.
Conley people are touchy.
She thought you'd go along.
-There's more to it than that.
-Come on.
You think too much.
You need to go home...
...open a nice bottle of champagne...
...make up with your wife and get some sleep.
It's over.
Thank you.
Absolutely. You're welcome.
Good night.
Good night.
Hi, Stephanie.
Must be difficult, nobody giving you information.
It's been a crazy week.
I had a friend. She was one of the first women to move high up.
You know what it's like, every day putting out fires.
It turned out the job wasn't what she thought.
She was looking the wrong way when they fired her. lnteresting.
Truth usually is, once you get to it.
It's you.
Where is everyone?
Mr. Garvin came in an hour ago.
Said they were working too hard.
Sent everyone home.
-What if Sanders doesn't bring it up?
-He will.
I talked to him about his presentation on Arcamax.
He has no idea.
When he brings up the line....
You must pounce because we don't have the harassment.
It must be that Sanders is incompetent.
It'll be in public. With reporters.
Bob's counting on you.
Let's clean out the database.
And any backup.
Catherine, can you hold on one minute?
Has my contract gone out already?
Shit.
What does it say about firing me?
They can fire me for cause, can't they? For incompetence?
The problem with the drives is not with the programming or the design.
It's with the production line and that's my responsibility.
This whole thing tomorrow...
...they're setting me up.
Housekeeping, please.
This is Mr. Conley.
Could someone come and turn down my bed?
My room number? It's on the phone here somewhere....
That's right.
Thank you very much.
-When does your dad arrive?
-Midnight. They stopped in Houston.
I'd love for him to get a chance to see the Corridor.
You know...
I stayed up late last night, fooling around with it up in my room.
It's really incredible.
I'm sorry, sir.
Here, thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Good night.
Have a nice evening.
You're in the Corridor, our prototype for a virtual reality database.
Enjoy the demonstration. lnformation accessed during this demo is for entertainment value only...
...and should not be duplicated to another database.
If you have any questions, ask the angel.
Malaysian Operations.
Searching Malaysian revisions file.
Why don't we go up to my suite?
Give my colleagues a chance to try out the Corridor.
Good idea.
''Reduction of air handling capacity from number 7 air handlers...
...to a more appropriate and cost-effective number 5.''
You can't put number 5 handlers in there. You'll have dirt in everything.
My God, she's in the system.
Angel, I need help.
Help is here.
Can I stop files from being deleted?
I'm sorry. You're not Level 5.
You're supposed to protect the files.
Sysop controls are restricted to Level 5.
Show me all communications with Malaysia.
Telephone or video?
Video.
Show me the last transmission involving Meredith.
Sooner or later, Tom will figure out the changes at the plant.
He's not stupid.
Tom will be out of the picture by Tuesday.
I don't like to gamble.
I love Tahoe, but I think the risk--
Think. Who'll believe him?
He's married, with a family.
He'll have no choice but to take the settlement and leave.
Then we say Sanders made the changes at the plant? He'll deny it.
He won't know.
He'll be gone by then.
These things are so darn complicated.
I think it's upside down.
There we go.
Who's first?
Must have left the system on.
Give it a try. You'll love it.
I'd love to try it.
I am totally screwed.
I'll make my presentation...
...Meredith will ask me questions.
She'll make me look totally incompetent.
Are you sure there's not another system somewhere?
The system has been completely deleted.
So I'm a sitting duck.
I'll be walking around like a ghost with a resume.
It's Mohammed Jafar.
How are you?
I don't mean to bug you, but we're departing Monday--
It's my fault. Susan got the
Disneyland tickets for you.
The E-tickets?
You're comped for all the rides and at the hotel they'll upgrade you.
Magnificent. I can't wait to tell my wife.
She said you were full of shit.
You know how women are.
Yes, I sure do.
I miss your face.
Talk to Arthur. He sees it enough on the DVL. I'm always--
Tom, are you there?
Mohammed, on this end, we back up our files on DAT.
Do you do the same over there?
I don't know what we have.
I'd have to check it out. Why?
I got a real problem here.
I'm up against the wall and...
...I need you to do some things for me, Mohammed.
I hope we have what you need, Tom.
Daddy?
I never believed what they said about you.
Thank you, honey.
Come here, big guy.
Thank you.
Those from Malaysia?
I can't believe it's still coming out.
It started at 7.
Testing.
Put these in one of the files.
Yeah, there's a real talent to fishing.
First you must choose the right bait...
...then you must know when to reel it in.
About the other day, I didn't mean...
Yes, you did.
I apologize, and...
...thank you.
I accept.
Which brings us to our
Advanced Products Group.
Tom Sanders heads our manufacturing department.
Tom, can you come up here...
...and review for us the revolutionary new product we call Arcamax?
Thank you, Meredith.
Arcamax is our own stand-alone
CD-ROM drive player.
Now, for a CD-ROM drive to be effective, it must be portable...
...it has to be fast.
Arcamax is twice as fast as any
CD-ROM drive in the world today.
We've had our problems, but we are solving them.
And were the problems with the design?
No, there are fabrication problems involving the production line.
What sort of problems?
For example, we should be using automatic chip installers to lock...
...the control chip on.
The Malaysians have been doing it by hand...
...jamming the chips in with their thumbs.
And the quality of the air is dirty.
We should use level 7 air handlers, we're using level 5.
And we're ordering our components, like...
...hinge rods and clips, not from our Singapore supplier...
...but from someone who's a lot cheaper but also less reliable.
I'm confused. You set up this line.
You didn't anticipate these problems?
The line was changed.
The specifications were altered.
How is that possible? We know you to be a competent manager.
You should know.
You ordered the changes.
I don't know how you got that idea.
You were in Kuala Lumpur last year.
To settle a labor dispute.
I've never even seen the line.
You haven't?
No, I don't know who told you I--
You're watching Malaysian Channel 3.
Perhaps instead of digging up Malaysian video clips...
...we should discuss the problems here...
...the problems in your department with the line you set up.
All right.
The 1st memo in the file being handed out is signed by Meredith Johnson.
It states that manual labor will be used to install the chips.
That made the Malay government happy.
It also meant voltage irregularities and memory allocation--
The Malay government insisted we fill those jobs.
The Malaysian government does not own shares of DigiCom.
These people here do.
The second memo...
...reduces the air handling capacity in order to cut costs.
And that's why we're getting dirt in the split optics, the drive arms.
The resulting delays will actually increase the costs by more than 70%.
-The third memo regarding--
-The drives are your responsibility!
These problems were created because of your incompetence.
That's what's wrong!
Passing the buck!
Back stabbing!
I'm not done.
This so-called evidence of yours is fooling no one!
You can protect your turf and think it means something.
You weren't told of these decisions because they're over your head.
This merger is about synergy...
...between hardware and software, between cash flow and capital needs.
That's a language you can't understand!
I don't either.
We're buying this company because they build things.
You understand what she means?
I'm trying to convey the sentiments of everyone here.
That's what I meant to do.
Could you step outside for a moment?
Can you build the darn thing or not?
Yes, sir, we can.
They're replacing Meredith.
Garvin's announcing it in 10 minutes.
Ten minutes?
I'm surprised you didn't come to gloat.
Gloating is underrated. I actually came here to pick up the Arcamax files.
Some smart people underrated you.
Thank you.
Not including myself.
I beat you. I beat you fair and square.
Garvin lost his nerve.
It was his brilliant idea to fire you for incompetence.
Him and Phil.
Now I'm being fired.
I've never seen you play the victim.
It's the only good quality you had.
I'm playing the game men set up, and I'm being punished for it.
It's fine.
I've had calls from ten head-hunters with job offers.
Don't be surprised if I'm back in ten years to buy this place.
Did it ever occur to you, Meredith, that maybe I set you up?
-This is my son, Spencer.
-How you doing?
-Good.
-You're at the University of Washington?
That's great. Very good.
What a week!
The Chinese say:
''May you live in interesting times.''
This merger is the most interesting merger I've had...
...since my 2nd marriage.
The merger is complete.
The question now is...
...who do we find to run things up here in Seattle?
And what I realized during this...
...very interesting week...
...is that I have probably focused too much on...
...breaking the glass ceiling, finding a woman to run things here...
...when I should have been looking for the best person...
...to run things here.
Someone whose...
...long service with this company has established a record...
...of creativity...
...sound judgement...
...and hands-on expertise.
And that person...
...is Stephanie Kaplan.
Congratulations, Stephanie.
I tell you something, she's the greatest!
Thank you.
First, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the department heads:
...Mary Anne Hunter and Mark Lewyn here...
...and Don Cherry, where are you?
There he is.
And particularly, Tom Sanders...
...who epitomizes the inventiveness of this division...
...its past and its future.
I'm counting on you to be my right-hand.
Thank you.
We are heading into a new millennium...
...a new time.
You a chemistry major, Spencer?
Yeah, I am.
I know a chemistry professor there,
Arthur Friend. A. Friend.
I don't know if he teaches freshmen.
I'm his research assistant.
So if Arthur Friend was in Nepal, for example...
...you'd have the keys to his office and computer password.
We all work so well together and it's exciting...
...and it's wonderful to see.
Thank you.
Your mother's an extraordinary woman.
You just figured that out?
SUBTITLES BY LUIS-SUBS
Swann.
And the fire said to me... said to me...
"Nix, Nix, you are my instrument.
From now on you shall be known... as... the Puritan.
You will find a few good men... and women... and together... together... you will cleanse the world."
Master.
Swann's here.
Are we ready?
- Ready.
- Maybe we should think about this.
He's gone too far.
So he took a kid.
He's gonna kill her.
He could drive us crazy.
So stay out here!
Please get away from me.
Hush!
Please don't hurt me!
I said, hush.
What is it?
What's the matter, huh?
Please! Please!
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Want me to shoot, Swann?
Leave me alone!
You don't like him, do you?
- He wants her magic.
- Maybe.
Go! Fetch him.
I think he's in love.
If you see the kid, yell.
- Quaid.
- Hey, man.
It's Quaid.
I thought you weren't coming back.
I changed my mind.
You can't leave, man.
He won't let you.
You're gonna be okay.
Okay?
I knew you'd come.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.
All you have to do... is beg.
Fuck you.
You don't think that
I've got it to give?
You're wrong!
I could eat your fucking soul!
Now be a good girl.
Fuck!
Stay here.
- Jennifer, are you okay?
- Jesus!
Stay away.
Stay the fuck away.
Are you okay?
How would you like... to see the world... the way it really is?
You wanna see flesh... with a god's eyes?
Swann?
Here he is.
Take a look, Swann.
These are your friends.
What have you done to him?
- Swann...
- Don't touch me!
He got into my head!
You wanna be like that, Swann?
Mud? Shit?
Come here.
Share the power.
Swann.
Help me.
Bag.
Help me.
- What are you doing?
- Binding you.
You piece of shit!
This isn't over, Swann.
This isn't finished.
Dead?
Dead.
What now?
We bury him so deep... no one will ever find him.
I been calling you for three days, Harry.
I missed you too, Loomis.
You got a beer?
I got a job for you... if you can tear yourself away from all this weird shit.
You need a woman's touch in here.
Why don't you get yourself a secretary?
On what you pay me?
So get married.
Tried that.
Oh, yeah.
"Harry D'Amour, who describes himself as a private detective... has been linked with occult activities on several occasions.
'We regard D'Amour as a highly dubious character...' quoted one source."
That's nice, Harry.
It's all bullshit.
It was on TV last night.
You looked like shit, by the way.
- Thanks.
- What's the story?
Was the kid really possessed?
Probably.
By what?
You know.
The usual.
You need a vacation.
Somewhere sunny, like...
L.A.
That's where the job is?
Guy's name's Tapert.
Big insurance fraud.
He's gone west to spend his ill-gotten gains.
It's worth ten grand... if you catch him doing it.
If I don't?
Catch a tan.
I need someone of your caliber on this, Harry.
Taste the darkness, D'Amour.
It's been waiting for you.
Yeah, well, maybe I do need a vacation.
You'll like L.A.
There's great weather, great women.
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a nice evening.
You bet.
Hello, L.A.
9:18 p.m.
Tapert's paying by the hour.
He's getting his money's worth.
Come here, you fuckers! Come on in!
Wait a minute.
He's late for something.
What the hell?
Ever watched a man die?
If you watch very closely... you can sometimes see the soul escaping.
And if you're very quick... you can catch it.
I wasn't there.
Ask Pimm.
Pimm's dead.
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.
They knew the Puritan was coming home.
So did you.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
Did you come for a reading?
My God.
What?
You are drawn to the dark side... over and over.
You don't like that.
Not much.
You can't change it.
You must walk the line... between heaven and hell.
It is your destiny.
Accept it.
Hang on.
I'm not afraid to die.
There's something terrible... coming home soon.
The Puritan?
Who is he?
Shit.
What were you doing up here?
I'm a private detective.
I was hired to follow a guy named
Tapert for a couple of days.
- Insurance fraud.
- Tapert.
So now I've got Tapert,
Butterfield...
Tapert's got nothin' to do with this.
He just came to get his palm read.
This is something else.
You ever heard of somebody called the Puritan?
New one on me. Let's see him.
Where the fuck is he?
He got up and walked.
After that fall, he would've broken half his bones.
I don't think he'd have given a shit.
D'Amour.
Why do I know that name?
I know him.
I saw him on TV.
Some kid got possessed, and he saved the little bastard's life.
A priest?
He's just some guy... who's got a nose for this shit.
Like you.
I don't want him getting in the way.
He won't.
We've, all of us, waited too long... to have the homecoming spoiled.
What do you mean, "all of us"?
A lot of people believed in Nix.
They haven't forgotten his promise.
About?
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
Coffee, Mrs. Swann?
Yes, thank you.
Where's Mr. Swann?
In his study.
He got something on his mind?
Hey. Mr. Sunshine.
That's what I'm gonna call you.
Bad show?
The usual.
Full house.
Standing ovation.
I tell them it's magic.
They believe you.
Yeah.
Remember Quaid?
Sure.
I think they killed him.
Oh, God.
I just saw him too.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.
Something special.
I want you to be there.
Of course.
You want me to find out about Quaid?
- I mean, the funeral?
- No.
I'm not going anywhere near him.
Higher.
Another inch.
The left hand side is too low.
Valentin?
Good. There.
Yes?
I want you to find this man D'Amour for me.
Think any movie stars buried around here?
Probably.
It's not a bad place.
It's warm, lots of palm trees.
I don't think the dead much care.
You sure?
- Are you a believer, then?
- Oh, yeah.
I signed on for all of them in my time.
Catholic, Hindu, Moonies.
You can't have too many saviors.
Who's that?
Swann's wife.
I want you to help me help my husband.
He's in some kind of trouble... something to do with the man you saw murdered.
I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
And you don't?
I think we make our own futures.
So, what's the connection?
I don't exactly know.
Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Why not?
He's a secretive man.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
But obviously you still care about him.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't.
Swann is one of the most remarkable men alive.
You don't believe me?
He's an illusionist.
That's not exactly brain surgery.
I'm sorry. You asked.
No, you're right.
He could've been something more.
Maybe a lot more.
But sometimes people get lost.
Even good people.
- Too much money, too much fame.
- Where do I sign up?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
- Harry.
- Harry.
When do you want me to start?
Come to the show with me.
It's his last performance in L.A. tonight.
I want you to see him with an audience. They love him.
Do you?
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.
- Tonight?
- Sure.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?
This is a big deal for me.
I gotta have the tux back by midnight.
Valentin!
I'm here.
The guy with Dorothea... is that him?
- Check if he's ready.
- Ready?
Ready.
How the fuck does he do that?
It's wires.
- I don't see no wires.
- So, what is it? Magic?
Ladies and gentlemen... you are standing on the threshold of a miracle.
Come with me into the great beyond.
He's good.
You haven't seen anything yet.
This is the new illusion.
Have you seen this before?
There's something wrong here.
For God's sake!
Wait! Who are you?
Oh, God.
Please.
Please, Dorothea.
Come away.
It's no use.
I got you, you fucker!
Who did this, D'Amour?
Who killed Swann?
You did.
Didn't you?
Why would I?
Beats me.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
I feel it!
Deep shit?
Who did this?
It was...
It was...
And this Butterfield guy?
Vanished.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
You through with me?
For now.
You planning on moving back to New York?
No, not yet.
- They treating you all right?
- Yeah.
I heard what happened.
I think I'm gonna stick around for a while.
Maybe dig in places that cops wouldn't look.
I wouldn't know where you'd start.
Maybe with the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
Yeah.
I think you probably can.
Now, down here is what they call the repository.
Behind those locked doors... lies every secret of magic known to mankind.
- Ever been in there?
- Me? No.
No, there are only three keys.
Vinovich has got one, of course.
It is more than entertainment.
We are opening up people's heads.
We are bringing miracles back into their miserable little lives.
But they're fake miracles.
Houdini believed he had spirit guides.
Do you believe that?
I believe... that we walk a narrow path... between...
Heaven and hell?
Divinity and trickery.
So then, sometimes... the miracles are real.
No. They are always fake.
The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
You could walk on water?
I can reproduce any miracle that has ever been performed... with a little preparation.
Even one of Swann's?
- They were no damn good.
- Really?
That's funny.
I heard he was one of the best.
If he was so good, why is he so dead?
You tell me.
I figured you'd have some theory.
I have many theories.
I'd like to hear one of them.
I'm not saying another word.
You damn fool, Wilder.
This man is a journalist.
No, I'm not a journalist.
I just wanted to know about Swann.
He was a freak.
Everything he did was tainted.
- With what?
- Evil!
He was evil.
Are you coming?
Do not speak to this man if you wish to keep my company.
That's a great accent.
What is it, Brooklyn?
Fuck you, all right?
Harry.
I've got to be careful.
- If Vinovich sees me talking to you...
- What do you want, Billy?
I heard a name.
Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who?
Nix.
He's dead now, but I think maybe he taught Swann.
Who's doing the talking?
Vinovich.
But you burned your bridges there.
This is me.
Good luck.
I loved what you did in there.
What are you looking at?
I just want to know what Philip saw in those cards and stop it from happening.
Divinity and trickery.
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.
- D'Amour.
- Harry, I know it's late.
That's okay.
How'd it go today?
Went up to the Magic Castle.
You were right. He didn't have a lot of friends up there.
They were jealous of him.
Why? Because he had you?
He didn't have me. I told you.
Yeah, you didn't marry him for love.
So, why did you marry him?
That's none of your business, Harry.
You ever hear of somebody called Nix?
Dorothea?
Yeah, I'm here.
I don't know the name.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell.
I have to go.
That's it?
All right. Look, I'll keep digging.
Yeah. You do that.
"Keep Out Police Department"
Ever watched a man die?
Yes.
"Desiderio."
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
- I tried the hotel.
- So why you'd come here?
You're a detective with no clues.
Where else would you look?
Do you mind?
I'll keep this brief.
Here's $30,000.
What for?
A ticket home.
You didn't hire me. She did. She wants me to stop, I wanna hear it from her.
- She doesn't want to see you.
- No?
- People are dying here.
- Yes.
It's a terrible tragedy.
Is that all you have to say?
It's a fucking terrible tragedy?
- I want to know why.
- Why people die?
Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.
Don't try to see her, D'Amour.
Just leave her alone.
Lock up, will you?
Jennifer has only ever had one visitor.
- Mr. Quaid?
- Right.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.
Heard it on the news.
Jennifer doesn't know... and frankly, this isn't the best time for her to be told.
I won't say anything.
She's been with us for four years and she was coming along nicely.
Past month she's been worst than ever.
- What's her problem?
- She has no real grip on reality.
- Does anybody?
- Oh, yes.
We have to agree on what's real and not.
That's what holds us together.
What does Jennifer think is real?
She thinks the devil's coming for her.
Have we met before?
Only I forget.
They give me pills, you know, to make me even.
And I...
I forget things.
You didn't forget me.
I just came to see if you remembered a man named Butterfield.
Maybe. I...
That's okay.
What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann.
He's a fucking liar.
Why is that?
He said he knew how to protect us.
But he didn't know anything.
He made us think it was over and done with.
What was?
I don't wanna think about it.
If I think about it, he'll... he'll hear me.
He'll find me.
Swann?
I told you. I don't want...
What is it?
Calm down.
No, he'll get me!
He's not... He's not...
Who's not gonna get you?
Nix. Nix.
- And he's the Puritan?
- Yes!
- And he's dead?
- No.
He's coming back.
He's digging his way out.
I'll take care of her now.
Jesus.
Billy. Harry D'Amour.
Listen.
Supposing I wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle.
There we go.
You done something like this before?
I've had my moments.
Hold that up.
- They've gotta have this place rigged.
- How?
It'll be something hokey.
Whoa!
Let's have a look around.
Butterfield's pal had this carved on his forehead.
Any idea what it is?
Nope.
What'd I tell you?
So fucking hokey.
What have we got here?
- Get the files.
- Fuck the files.
Billy, get the files!
Go on!
Jesus!
I could have lost my fucking hands!
That would have kept you out of the magic circle... which was presumably the idea.
Why don't you take a look through these?
Go on.
These must be about Nix.
The Puritan?
Look at that.
A Nix specialty?
I don't know any of these tricks.
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking the path between...
Trickery and divinity.
He's saying that all the time.
He said that because he knew.
Son of a bitch.
He'd seen these and he knew.
Knew what?
Get it off of me!
Where the fuck are you?
Hold it right there.
I said hold it...
Hokey enough for you?
I'm out of here, man.
Comin'?
Yeah.
I'm comin'.
I can't let you in.
This is the way he wanted it.
No autopsy... no embalming... nobody meddling with his body.
"Flesh is a trap," he used to say.
"Flesh is a trap... and magic sets us free."
Why did you come back?
I've been doing some digging.
What did you find?
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Nix ran some kind of a cult, right?
Some kind of a
Charlie Manson deal?
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, wasn't he?
Swann said he could do stuff.
Like?
He could levitate, juggle fire... and he could get into people's heads... make them see things.
- Terrible things.
- What things?
I don't know.
- And he taught some of this to Swann?
- Yes, some of it.
So then, Swann wasn't performing illusions.
He was doing magic.
Yes.
What? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer... instead of making millions?
- Look, I told you.
- Right. I know. Too much fame.
That'd be enough to turn anybody's head, including yours.
Oh, fuck you.
You're the one who said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
Then what?
What the hell was going on here?
- I was grateful to him.
- For what?
Everything I had I owed to him.
And he loved me.
He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
Didn't he?
I can't help you unless you talk to me!
- You can't help me.
- You don't know that!
I was so afraid.
Don't be.
Nix can't hurt you now.
I know.
I was the one who shot him.
I was 12.
Nix took me hostage to get Swann to come to him.
And they all came.
- Yeah.
- Quaid and Jennifer and...
Swann and Pimm.
What was that?
Valentin?
Wait!
What the hell?
It's him. It's Nix.
Dorothea, stay there.
Find Valentin!
Find him and get him in here. Now!
This is sacrilege.
Are you satisfied now?
Don't worry. I'm not hurting him.
Looks like you're not a widow after all.
Sit down.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Yes.
You set up the fake body?
And then what?
Because I was getting too close to something or someone... you called Swann?
No. First I tried to pay you off.
Was it Swann's idea?
It was mine.
I didn't want any more bloodshed.
That's why we went to all this trouble.
So Nix would have no one to come after.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake!
What is wrong with you people?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
I want to meet with
Swann face to face.
Why can't you just let this alone?
Let everyone think it's over.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we should just let him stay dead.
Couldn't stay away, could you?
Had to see who cried over you the most, huh?
You know... a lot of people are gonna be pissed off when they find out you're still alive.
And they will, you know.
No matter how much shit you bury yourself under, you're gonna...
You shouldn't have followed me.
How do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.
You need me alive.
Why? So you can fuck the woman I love?
If you love her so much, why did you widow her?
What a waste.
You can do shit that most of us can only dream about.
Then you go around pretending it's just some trick.
Illusionists get Las
Vegas contracts.
Magicians get burned.
Yeah, or murdered like Nix.
Oh, he deserved it.
Maybe he doesn't feel that way.
Maybe he's digging himself out of that hole you put him in right now.
That's what you're hiding away from, isn't?
I did it for Dorothea.
Yeah?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
- So Nix won't be looking for her.
- I betrayed him.
But she shot him. If I'm Nix, that'd piss me off a little bit.
I don't know what else to do.
Help me.
Look... if Nix is back from the dead... then he is some kind of a god... and he'll find you wherever the fuck you go.
But if he's just another phony messiah... then you can stage the greatest comeback in history.
Who's there?
Easy.
I've sometimes thought... if I'd had another profession...
I would have been a surgeon.
To be able to heal with one little cut.
Say that those eyes of yours were troubling you.
- Please.
- I could just scoop them out.
No, don't.
Then tell me where Nix is buried.
I don't know.
Wait! Wait!
I'll tell you.
Oh, you'll do more than that.
What is it?
Did Dorothea know where Nix was buried?
No.
Did Valentin?
Yes.
Do you like the look of these?
I made them myself... to set him free.
Why did you wait so long?
I didn't have the skill... to resurrect him... to teach myself.
That took time.
Think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect after 13 years?
If he was just a man... like me, then no... but he's not.
What is he, then?
Maybe he'll show you.
Anything?
Not yet.
- If you have lied to me...
- No, I swear!
This is the place
Swann told me about.
- The rocks...
- Five more minutes.
- Are you hearing me?
- I'm doing my best.
What have you got there?
Fucker!
Butterfield!
He's in the corner!
Don't touch him.
It's him.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Smell it.
He's coming. He's coming.
He will come.
Help me!
Get out of the car.
Get out of the fuckin' car!
He's got Dorothea.
- And Nix?
- Yes.
- Don't bother about me.
- Shut up!
We've already lost enough lives.
Please accept my apologies, D'Amour.
For what?
You're going to lose one more.
No!
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this way.
You don't get it, do you?
This is where we're all goin'.
Do you wish him amongst us?
Yes.
Will you come unto him upon your knees?
Be ready.
Listen.
You got everything you want.
You don't need me.
No, but he will, after what you did to him.
He'll want vengeance.
Christ in heaven!
My lord.
He's coming home.
He's with us.
He's with us.
Hold her!
Open your eyes.
He's with us.
Where is Swann?
- He's dead.
- No, he isn't.
I swear.
Children.
Will you suffer to come unto me?
Jesus.
What the hell is goin' on in there?
At a guess, they just resurrected him.
Fuck!
I've come back to bring you the wisdom of the grave.
- Will you hear it?
- Yes.
Follow me.
Do I know you, child?
Yes.
I do, don't I?
No gun this time, child?
Where is Swann?
I don't know where he is.
He'll come.
We have unfinished business, he and I.
This is where we killed him.
Looks like you didn't try hard enough.
I can't go any further.
Where is she, you fuck, huh?
Are you ready for my wisdom?
Here is my wisdom.
Go! Help her!
You see, I escaped from the grave... so I have to give something to the grave in return.
Yes. Show us.
Show us, Puritan.
I have to give something back... so I'm giving you.
What's happening?
Go ahead, bleed.
Bleed!
What are you doing?
You're not worthy.
None of you.
Fuck you!
Only Swann is worthy.
You just waited like lambs.
I'm not your shepherd.
You're not Swann.
Who are you?
Oh, I know what you want.
Hold on!
Nix!
There you are.
Come on!
I've had a long time... to think about you.
Where did I go wrong?
And?
I should have been honest with you from the start.
I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.
I was born... to murder the world.
You can still help me do that if you want.
Why would I wanna do that?
The lady has a new love in her life.
Your friends are all dead.
No one can save you now... but me.
- Come on!
- We can't leave him there!
I'm not going to!
Bitch!
Butterfield!
Will you help me?
Yes.
Now you know I will kill you when we're done. I have to.
- Yes.
- But until then... it'll be just the two of us... the way it always was.
Yes.
Wait.
You still feel something for that bitch?
Yes.
Will... you... never... learn?
She's just flesh...
Swannie boy!
I'll show you.
Dorothea?
Dorothea?
Where is she?
Where did she go?
You've got Swann's disease.
You think that with a little courage and a little love... that it'll all be all right.
Tell me where she is and
I'll make it go away.
Dig, D'Amour.
Touch the darkness.
It's been waiting for you.
Harry, it's not real.
Now listen to me.
Look at me!
You'll be okay.
There you are, child.
Come along, child.
What are you seeing now?
There.
One... last... illusion.
What's it going to be?
- Fire to burn out your eyes?
- Let's go!
I'm sure Swann loved your eyes.
You shouldn't have taken him away from me.
We were going to be together... when I finished with the world.
We were going to keep each other company... in the dark.
But I'm on my own.
We're all on our own.
The grave is lonely.
But living is worse.
What the fuck are you?
A man who wanted to be a god... then changed his mind.
I'm going to be rotten shit from now on.
The car.
Can you raise me up like the car?
I'm going to show the world what's waiting at the end.
And I am going to make it... despair.
Fucker!
It's me.
Is it finished?
I think so.
Run.
Run!
And the fire said to me... said to me...
Hush!
You will see flesh with a god's eyes.
I was born... to murder the world.
"Flesh is a trap."
That's what he used to say.
"Flesh is a trap... and magic sets us free."
Idon't know why you make me read them bedtime stories.
All I hear is,
"Mommy reads better.
'Sports lllustrated' isn't a book."
I have a thought.
Hey hey, don't get overheated.
Might I suggest that perhaps the reason for Raymond's unwillingness to share with the parental responsibilities is a fear of intimacy, brought on by his distant and somewhat strained relationship with his father?
Robert's been seeing
Dr. Greenberg every Tuesday.
What, your therapist?
Oh, that's wonderful,
Robbie.
How does he do it-- push two couches together?
You see, joking is nothing more than a defense mechanism.
It masks some real problems that certain men have because they are afraid to get in touch with their feelings.
Hey, Dad, I'm giving Robert the finger in my mind.
Want me to put one up for you?
No, I got it.
Both of you, put those down.
That's okay, Ma.
This is men in a nutshell.
I wish you would take Ray to Dr. Greenberg sometime.
Don't think
I wouldn't love to.
Most of my problems stem from my combative male relationships in the home.
Shut up.
God forbid you should improve as a human being.
Fix your relationship with your brother.
My relationship with him is fine.
What are you bringing this psycho-crapola into my house for?
It's not crapola!
You're just afraid to look at yourself.
No, I'm afraid to look at you
'cause you're ugly.
You're the ugly one.
You're ugly on the inside.
Then go outside!
- You go outside!
- It's my house!
I forgot-- you don't have a house
'cause you still don't have a life!
What? What?
Oh... Iisten,
I didn't mean it.
Come on.
Come on.
Look, all right, all right.
Maybe...
I'll go with you tomorrow.
Yes!
I can't wait to hear how it goes.
Me too.
Tell me all about it.
Oh, you're going too,
Frank.
No, sir.
Oh, yes.
Or I will finally be calling Cousin Bella.
- Don't you threaten me.
- Who's cousin Bella?
My cousin Bella happens to be a top psychiatrist.
She's a hideous monster.
For years, she's offered to come up from South Carolina to stay with us for some emergency marriage counseling.
I'm gonna call her right now.
Put down that phone.
She's gonna stay with us as long as it takes to make you a person.
All right!
I'll go with them to the thing.
He's gonna have therapy!
- Dad!
- Oh, my gosh, he's going to therapy!
I can't believe it!
Wonderful day!
Oh, and Frank, don't be afraid to let them keep you for observation.
This is so great.
All right, guys, there's a couple of things
I wanna go over before we go inside.
I don't want this to throw you off, but Dr. Greenberg has a bit of a lazy eye.
Okay?
So when he looks at you, he may not be looking at you.
He may be looking at you.
So you guys know what you wanna start with today?
How much I hate you.
Actually, that's very good.
Don't hold back, Raymond.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Yeah, I actually have something
- I need to get off my chest.
- What is it, Dad?
I'm not going in there.
What?
I'm not going in there, and I would never set foot in some voodoo man's sucker trap-- not for all the tea in China, nor for all the Chinese waitresses who bring the tea.
There. I feel better.
Dad, come on.
We had a deal.
Hey, look, if he's not going, then I'm not going, all right?
- Let's just get a slice.
- Now you're talking.
No, wait.
Listen listen. Hey hey.
I'm paying an extra $100 for this session, and it's two hours, you see, so you can't go home because the girls will know.
Did you pay him the extra money yet?
No, I'm gonna pay him right now.
You've got
100 extra bucks... and we've got two free hours?
Ooh, yeah!
This is not what I had in mind.
Oh, no?
We're up 500 bucks.
Maybe you should start having that in mind, phone pole.
Yeah, phone pole,
'cause you're big.
All right, that's enough.
Not only did you two lie to the girls, but you made me lie to the doctor.
Now it's gonna be harder than ever to look Dr. Greenberg in the eye.
Oh my God, look at this.
We gotta bet this horse.
This is a big horse, a sure thing.
This horse is unstoppable.
"Marie's Mouth."
This is a sign from God.
We're supposed to be here.
I'm in!
I'm way in.
Care for a piece, Robert?
It is a good sign.
So how was therapy?
I gotta tell you, it was kind of a fulfilling experience.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, isn't this wonderful?
What did you think, Frank?
Well, when you were yanking me into this,
I was, as you know, very skeptical.
But then I got there, and I have to say... it really paid off.
And I owe it all to Marie's Mouth.
I'm so happy I helped.
To Marie's Mouth!
This is so great!
You mean this guy got through to you guys a little?
I gotta tell you, that Dr. Greenberg, he's a genius.
Know what? I am really proud of you guys.
So what else did Dr. Greenberg say?
Well... he said that I've actually been in denial with my feelings towards Robert.
Yeah.
I think I love him now.
This is so sweet.
And we realize how lucky we are to have you guys at home too.
Dr. Greenberg said that our marital companions can help our situation even further.
Oh, fine with me. How?
Well... we all have... you know... tension... and whatever you can do to alleviate... you know...
Dr. Greenberg said.
I'm happy to help.
Oh, Frank, I can't wait to talk more about this.
I always say nothing is more important than discussing one's feelings, and now we can have real discussions.
Yeah.
About that...
Dr. Greenberg advised me to have a cone of silence.
A cone of silence?
Yes, I need a cone of silence...
...around me whenever I feel
"Bad Frank" coming on.
He suggested a 10-foot radius.
A little more.
That's good, honey.
Oh, Chi Chi.
I'll do anything if it means you're mentally balanced.
The balance feels good now.
Hello, ladies.
Hey.
How are we doing?
We are up like a wedgie on the fat kid at camp.
How much?
Well, my Papa, after five weeks, we have cleared
1,400 semoles.
Here's to psychotherapy.
What excuse did you give
Dr. Greenberg this week?
I didn't even talk to him this week.
I told him I was gonna be working undercover for a while, and when I came back,
I'd have plenty of issues.
What kind of issues?
I told him
I had to dress as a woman, and I had to borrow the outfit from my mother.
- That's perfect.
- I know.
If he only knew what a sick bastard you really are.
I know!
So what's gonna be our breakthrough for today?
Let's see.
The last thing
I told the wives is that we were working on
Dad's withholding of affection when we were kids...
Good good.
...and how it impacted negatively on us.
For instance, whenever I did something
I always felt that Dad was disappointed in me, not to mention the neglect and verbal abuse.
Okay.
So what can we say as to why you were like that-- you know, unreceptive to our needs and stuff?
Right right.
Why was I like that?
'Cause you two were a couple of monkey's asses.
Okay.
I think that might be the verbal abuse you're talking about,
Robert.
No.
I been thinking about this since last week.
You know what you two's problems were?
You took all that abuse stuff personally.
Of course we took it personally.
You're our father!
It was just business.
This isn't exactly what they call a triumph of analysis.
What else you got?
What else you got?
How about, uh... you were withdrawn from your relationship with us because your father was like that with you?
That's friggin' great.
Yeah. Very good, Raymond.
Yeah yeah. Just like you were talking about the other day.
I'm kind of a lousy dad because of him, so I just back it up one more to Grandpa Joe.
Yeah yeah, and his dad was the worst.
- My Grandpa Sal.
- Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Grandpa Sal, very scary.
He once made Mussolini wet himself.
My dad used to tell me horrible stories about how his father used to hit him... when he wasn't hitting me.
Grandpa Joe hit you?
Sure.
I got hit every day.
Wow, Dad.
I didn't know it was like that for you.
It was like that for everybody.
That's just the way it was.
So your dad's dad hit him, he hit you, and you never really hit us.
I couldn't.
I don't know.
I was always weaker than him.
Maybe you didn't want to be like him.
I didn't.
The girls will buy that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
They'll eat it up like a bag of candy.
Come on, let's bet the next race.
I'm treating.
Hey Dad, can we get ice cream?
Sure.
Is it 6:00 yet?
Almost. The boys should be home from therapy soon.
Isn't it wonderful?
Frank's a new man.
It's like I'm cheating.
Did you see this?
- What?
- What is it, dear?
It's Dr. Greenberg.
Obituaries. He died?
Oh my God, that's awful.
I know.
He had a heart attack last week.
He was such a sweet man.
Oh, his poor family.
This is terrible.
Wait a minute.
He died last week?
It's subconscious, which is why we have to keep going.
Hello, beauties.
Something smells good, and I'm not talking about dinner.
Hey there, baby doll.
How about giving Daddy a little sugar?
Good session today?
Oh, great great.
Some major breakthroughs.
Better than major.
General-- four-star general breakthroughs.
I gotta be honest--
I feel really great.
Since I've been in analysis, my whole outlook is different.
That Dr. Greenberg was sent from heaven.
Hey, look at this.
What do you got?
I thought he looked a little pale when we left.
What is it?
Oh my God, was he hit by a car?
He's got that lazy eye.
It was a heart attack,
Robert.
He died last week.
Oh.
Ohh!
What is it?
Give me that.
Good night.
Where do you think you're going, Frank?
The news is depressing.
I'm gonna lie down.
Frank, you'd better take a good look at this section,
'cause you're gonna be in there tomorrow.
Well, maybe not tomorrow.
Looks like it takes a week.
I demand an explanation.
You lied to us.
Where exactly have you been going?
All right, if you must know.
- We go to church--
- Oh, bull!
Oh! To lie about church is a double sin!
This is a terrible thing you did.
What did we do?
You tricked us into thinking you weren't pigs anymore, but you are worse than pigs.
You're talking pigs who lie!
Why would you do this to us?
Here we were so happy that you guys were finally connecting.
And we pictured you sitting in Dr. Greenberg's office and going through all your awful fights and traumas and crying, and it was so cute.
Where did you go, Frank?
I'm not talking.
There is such a thing as patient-doctor confidentiality.
Robbie?
To the track.
Oh, what?!
You're gambling?!
What are you-- an imbecile?
How dare you?!
I'm married to a mentally diseased, gambling psychopath.
Oh, yeah?
I won!
I won!
And I'm glad what I done.
It's a good thing we didn't go to the headshrinker.
I told you guys therapy was a crock.
They take your money and then when you need the guy, like today, he's doing something else.
This is unbelievable, Ray.
No, Debra, come on, look.
This was supposed to make us happier, right?
Well, we're all happy now.
This is dirty happiness.
You know what you did.
You played on our sensitivities.
You took advantage of us.
You knew I would be so proud of you that I'd let you slide on everything around here, including me.
All right, okay.
But we really did work stuff out.
Right, guys?
You know, we did.
We really did.
We had to, for our made-up crap to be believable.
It's true.
Something good happened while we weren't going to therapy.
Me and Dad and Robert, we enjoyed being together and we laughed and... we found out stuff.
So you don't have to be mad, because what you wanted us to get out of therapy we kind of did.
And we feel good now, except for the dead doctor part.
But I can honestly say that we are better people now.
You've seen it.
So can't you be a little happy for us?
I am happy for you.
But don't touch me.
Deb.
I need a 10-foot radius.
No dinner for you!
I'm very disappointed in you, Robert.
Who do I talk to?
Explain it again,
Cousin Bella, because I really want him to understand it.
Well, Frank... it is my opinion that this lack of communication comes from your fear of intimacy.
But what you need to do is listen to your wife when she speaks.
Really listen to her.
Because it's important that she knows you care about her.
So we will explore this together over the next three weeks that I'm here.
What are you feeling, Frank?
What am I feeling?
HARRY: They're not as bad as you might think.
In fact, sometimes they're pretty good company.
GUARD: Cuff up!
HARRY: You can get used to just about anything in prison. Even a Palmetto bug.
I tried writing again.
Nothing came out that didn't sound bitter and cynical.
And there's nothing worse than a writer who doesn't have anything to say.
Yeah, well.
That's me.
Harry Barber.
Hey, Harry.
Man, I've got some good news.
I'm talking about some real good news.
You know what this is?
This is your ticket out of here, that's what.
- Here's the judge.
- GUARD: Right here, Barber.
Mr. Barber, your conviction has been overturned by a federal judge.
Flipped like a buttermilk pancake.
Testimony in a related case contradicted key evidence presented at your trial.
What he's saying is someone's turned states and fessed up.
You were framed.
Your sentence has been commuted, effective immediately.
Don't thank me. Not much, anyway.
The requisite paperwork has already been filed.
You'll be released within 24 hours.
All right!
All right.
What's wrong? You're free.
Your Honor,
I don't want to be ungrateful.
That's it, I'm done. I'm free.
This is justice.
What about the two years of my life?
Two years of my life wasted because I was honest.
Because I wasn't dirty like everybody else.
What about that?
Mr. Barber, that's something that you can take that up with your attorney.
I'm not taking it up with my attorney,
I'm taking it up with you!
You're the justice... Hey!
What about my... Don't turn me off!
Don't turn me off! You bastard!
Hey! I want my two years back!
I want it back!
I want it back! I want my two years back!
JOHN: Oh, my goodness, Harry Barber, as I live and breathe.
John Renick.
Aren't you a little out of your jurisdiction?
- Maybe.
- Got a cig?
Yeah.
Why don't you let me give you a lift.
- It's gonna be 105 today, you know?
- I can take a little heat.
Come on. Hop in.
I'm heading right back to Palmetto.
I ain't going to Palmetto.
Oh, yeah. Is that right?
Where are you going?
Miami.
It's all over with, Harry.
Palmetto's cleaned up top to bottom.
Trust me.
Yeah, but I'll just bet it squeaks.
Thanks for the cig.
Wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight.
You're really going to Miami?
Miami, Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco.
As long as it ain't Palmetto.
- What's Nina got to say about that?
- I didn't ask.
Maybe you should.
You smell good, Harry.
Nina, I am not going back to Palmetto.
Oh, you taste good.
Nina, it's been a couple of years.
I know.
I'm going to Miami, Nina.
Shut up, Harry.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Is it morning?
I don't know. I think so.
- Thanks for making the coffee.
- Yeah. Pretty good, huh?
Strong?
Weak?
Bad.
It's been a couple years.
I was looking at your piece there.
The marquet?
HARRY: Marquet. Yeah, it's...
I don't understand how you're making your money, because if you're selling it for 12 bucks, the metal itself has gotta be worth more than that.
(LAUGHS) Well, actually, it's $1,200, Harry.
It's $1,200? Wow.
Harry, this is what I do now.
Yeah, I don't blame you.
Okay, yeah, thanks.
Find anything?
Sure.
There's nothing I'm good at.
It'll be tough for you in this town,
Mr. Barber.
Think so?
- Don't you like my bourbon?
- I do.
Why don't you take it then?
I don't drink.
Maybe tomorrow I'll ask you why you ordered it if you don't drink.
Maybe tomorrow I'll tell you.
Harry. Harry?
How'd it go today?
Humiliating.
Listen, baby, you can't expect something good just to happen overnight.
You know,
I've got my exhibition coming up.
If you want to, I have so much work to do,
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna finish it up.
I have deliveries to make, and I have to figure out this whole space.
We can maybe do it together.
It might be fun.
Maybe I can make some deliveries for you?
That'd be great.
I'd be good at being your fucking errand boy.
Harry, I didn't mean it that way.
I just thought that...
Well, don't think, Nina!
You worry about your scrap metal,
I'll worry about Harry Barber.
(SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING)
I need to make a phone call.
Yeah. Right over there.
Thank you.
Oh, God!
Oh, I left my handbag in there.
I was just gonna hand it in to the bartender.
How thoughtful of you.
Is there a problem, lady?
No, I left my handbag in the phone booth, and this gentleman was going to turn it in.
Yeah? Maybe you better make sure everything's there.
Yes, it's all here.
Thank you.
And thank you.
Can I buy you a drink?
- It's not necessary.
- But it's customary.
Excuse me.
Another round for the gentleman.
I'll have a vodka martini with a twist.
You lost?
Do I seem lost?
No, just a little out of place.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Take it any way you like it.
My name's Harry Barber.
So, Mr. Barber, how do you spend your time?
What do you mean?
I mean, what do you do?
I don't smoke.
Well, what do I do?
What does anybody do?
I just try to survive, I guess.
Maybe you'd like to do more than just survive?
Who wouldn't?
I may know of something.
Would you be interested?
I'm interested now.
The money's good.
It's very good.
But, in exchange, there's an element of risk.
Risk?
Does that worry you?
Question is, does it worry you?
If I could, I would do the job myself.
What is this job exactly?
Why don't you call me tomorrow and we can talk about it some more.
I'm gonna settle the check.
I almost forgot.
Yeah. Well, I didn't.
Until tomorrow then?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I noticed your sign there.
It said you needed... Help was wanted.
What kind of, you know, help do you need?
The $6 an hour kind, to pump gas, cut bait...
HARRY: Wow, look at that boat. Rhea M.
Who owns that?
Fella by the name of Malroux.
Got an "x" on the end of it.
- "X" on the end of what?
- His name. It's French or some such.
Oh, yeah, French.
His Christian name is Felix.
That's got an "x" on the end of it, too, by the way.
I bet you were, maybe, a spelling bee champion in school.
He owns that boat and he owns that big house out on Cranleigh Key.
He bought that place?
What's a fella with all that money doing in a one-horse town like Palmetto?
Sorry.
Well, he's a lung cancer case.
He's here for his health.
He ain't got that much longer left to live, from what I hear.
- And the blonde?
- That's Mrs. Malroux.
Boat's named after her.
Got another boat named Odette.
That's named after his daughter.
- HARRY: Two "t's"?
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.
But he don't keep her here.
The boat, I mean.
Malroux.
Must be worth a fortune.
Well, I wouldn't trade places with him for all the tea in Chinee.
He's a lung cancer case.
Well, mister, you still interested in this job?
No thanks, old-timer.
I think I might have a better offer.
Hi, baby. I'll see you in about an hour.
- Where are you going?
- I've got a delivery to make.
- Let me do it for you.
- No, no, no. After yesterday, no way.
Let that go, first of all.
It'll make me feel like I'm contributing.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
Here.
Can I help you?
- Special delivery for Mrs. Malrow.
- I'll take it.
Well, no. She has to sign for this herself.
It's a telephone order.
Okay, wait right here.
Hope I'm not disturbing you, Mrs. Malrow.
It's Malroux.
No, you're not disturbing me at all.
I was just gathering some rosemary.
DONNELLY: Hey, you!
It's all right, Donnelly, I'll handle it.
Listen, do me a favor.
The next time you have a delivery, can you wait outside?
Yes, sir.
I like your initiative, Mr. Barber.
- Just checking my facts.
- And what are your facts?
That you're Rhea Malroux.
You're married to Felix Malroux.
You have a daughter named Odette, and that you live in the biggest house in Cranleigh Key.
Anything else?
You have a job for me.
Your facts seem to check out, Mr. Barber.
So, let's talk.
Not here.
- Do you know East Beach?
- I know it.
You know the bungalows for rent by the water?
- I've seen them.
- Rent one.
Then what?
Meet me tonight.
Give me one good reason why I should.
I can do better than that.
You have a phone call, ma'am.
Let me pay you for that then. $100, was it?
Two.
Give the man his money and show him the way out.
Can I use the car?
Can I use the car?
Nina!
Oh, sorry.
Can I use the car?
Yeah. Sure. Wow.
You sure you got a job at the marina?
- What do you mean?
- Well, you look pretty swanky-do.
Well, you know,
I'm excited to be working again.
What, should I change?
No, you look really handsome.
Go ahead, impress the fish.
Come here. Give me a kiss.
See you later. Have fun.
Don't do that to the fish.
RHEA: Good evening, Mr. Barber.
Excuse me.
May I have a drink, please?
Vodka martini with a twist?
Bravo, Mr. Barber.
You were paying attention in class.
Are you married, Mr. Barber?
No.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yeah. I...
We're living together.
RHEA: How old-fashioned of you.
I didn't know we were here to discuss my personal life.
What's wrong with talking about your personal life?
- It's personal.
- Pardon me.
So...
You wanted to talk with me about something, Mrs. Malroux-row?
- Roux.
- Roux.
Yes.
I...
I have a job for you.
Yeah, you... So you said.
As I mentioned, there's an element of risk involved.
- You mentioned that, yes.
- You do take risks, don't you, Mr. Barber?
Do I?
You took a rather large risk when you took the money from my purse.
Sorry, we're all out of twist.
So, what is this job anyway,
Mrs. Malroux?
My stepdaughter is going to be kidnapped.
The ransom will be $500,000.
I need someone to be the threatening voice on the telephone.
For making that call and for collecting the ransom,
I'm willing to pay 10%.
That's $50,000.
Yeah, I can do the math.
Are you interested?
I'm no kidnapper.
I don't need you to kidnap anyone because nobody's going to be kidnapped.
My stepdaughter, Odette, is simply going to disappear for a few days.
Does she know that?
It was her idea.
What do you need $500,000 for?
Your husband's rich.
Why don't you just ask him for the money?
My husband believes that his daughter and I should be able to manage on the allowance he provides.
I admit it's a generous allowance for reasonable people.
Just so happens that neither my stepdaughter nor I are reasonable people.
May I have another drink, please?
You realize, of course, that kidnapping is a federal crime, and that the FBI is probably gonna get in on this?
First of all, there's not going to be any kidnapping.
Secondly, my husband will not involve the authorities.
So what makes you so sure about that?
I know my husband.
So, let me get this straight.
Girl disappears.
I make a phone call, collect the money.
I take my cut, I give you the rest, the girl goes back home, and everybody's happy ever after.
Is that the deal?
Essentially.
That sounds easy.
It will be.
Are you a cop?
Do I look like a cop?
Answer the fucking question.
No.
- You wearing a wire?
- A what?
Did you find what you were looking for?
RHEA: Maybe you better check again.
I don't want you to miss anything.
In all this excitement,
Mr. Barber, I don't remember hearing whether you were in or out.
HARRY: In all this excitement,
I don't remember saying.
I need to know.
Time is of the essence.
I need to meet with this Odette.
That could be arranged.
HARRY: Tomorrow, here.
Alone.
RHEA: She's only 17.
You might need a chaperon.
HARRY: You don't have to worry about me.
I can behave myself.
RHEA: It's not you I'm worried about.
How was it?
Well, you know, dull, tedious, boring, in no particular order.
I got the strangest call from Mrs. Wintergarden.
Who?
Mrs. Wintergarden, the woman whose house you took the vase over to when you made the delivery yesterday.
Oh...
Yeah, yeah.
She says she never got it.
- You sure you had the right address?
- Yeah.
Sure, there was no one home.
I just, you know, rang the doorbell, put it on the steps.
It's weird.
It had such a beautiful finish.
I'll call her tomorrow.
You come here. I've missed you.
I gotta take a shower.
I smell like fish.
I'll be right back.
Hurry up.
- Wild Bill.
- Hi, Mr. Barber.
Listen. You think I could rent the bungalow a couple extra days?
Sure!
Season's been pretty slow.
We got cancellations up the wazoo.
In that case, maybe I'll take it for the weekend.
Okay. Paying cash, Mr. B?
Yeah.
Here. No need for a receipt.
Okay. Hey, good luck.
- With what?
- The writing.
Thanks.
- Harry Barber?
- Yeah.
I'm Odette Malroux.
Odette, yeah, come in, come in.
You...
Odette Malroux.
Can I get you a Coke or something?
Don't you have anything stronger than that?
I don't know. The law says you gotta be 21 to drink in this state.
- So?
- I always obey the law.
My granddad used to wear suspenders.
So did mine.
So, is Harry Barber your real name or did you make it up?
What's the matter, you don't like it?
No, I love it.
Sounds delicious.
It's just that you don't look like a Harry Barber.
Oh, really. What's a Harry Barber supposed to look like?
I don't know. I never met one before.
Odette Malroux?
What kind of a name is that?
Malroux's French.
Odette's on my mother's side.
She was from New Orleans.
Was?
She drove herself off a cliff in the Pyrenees mountains three years ago.
I'm sorry to hear that.
They never did figure out if she meant to or not.
So Rhea's your stepmother?
I'd hardly call her my stepmother.
She's more like a big sister.
We're only 14 years apart.
Yeah, but she refers to you as her stepdaughter.
That's her problem.
So, Odette, the reason I wanted you to come here today...
You want to know if I'm in on this, right?
- That's a good place to start.
- Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, I'm gonna pretend to be kidnapped.
Yes, Rhea and I are gonna ask my father for 500 grand.
And, yes, he'll pay it.
Yes, yes, yes.
You mind if I ask what it is you need the money for?
My father wants to send me away to boarding school.
One of those awful, boring Swiss schools run by awful, boring Swiss nuns.
He doesn't like the idea of me being so American.
Then why don't you just tell him that you don't want to go?
Why don't you tell him?
Why can't I ever find a match?
Look, I love my father, I really do, but I'm not going away to that school.
No way.
I figure 500 grand will get me through till my 18th birthday, and then I'll be on my own.
Oh, really? You think half a mill might last you till you're 18?
Do you think it's enough?
I don't really know anything about money.
Rhea came up with the amount.
- So this was her idea?
- No.
I thought it up.
Do you like it?
- You ever see the inside of a jail cell?
- On TV.
They make it look pretty on TV.
If I get caught,
I'll just say it was all a prank.
The cops won't think it's a funny idea.
Neither will I.
You're way too serious, Harry Barber.
Lighten up.
You son of a bitch, you hit me!
Get the hell out of here
- before I hit you again.
- No.
- Get out of here!
- No!
Listen, I don't play games, you hear.
Not when I could spend the next 20 years of my life in prison.
Cops get a hold of you, they're gonna question you till your ears bleed.
Yeah, well, I'm a pretty good liar when I have to be.
I don't doubt it.
You got me right in the eye.
I'm sorry.
- Did I hurt you?
- Yeah, you hurt me!
- Let me kiss it and make it better.
- Get off!
I'm just saying we need a story.
You know, a simple story.
Let's say
I meet a girlfriend Saturday night.
Let's say we're gonna have a drink and go to a movie.
Let's say my girlfriend shows up and can't find me.
Let's say it's because someone grabbed me out of the parking lot.
That's not bad.
Needs work, but it's not bad.
You're losing your hair, Mr. Barber.
- How're you doing?
- Oh, just peachy.
You look great.
I could gobble you right up.
You invited your sister.
NINA: Harry. Don't start.
Of course I invited my sister.
Just because she's married to a cop.
He's not even a cop anymore, Harry.
Yeah. Once a cop, always a cop.
Oh, hi, Alda.
Hi, Harry.
- Hey.
- Hey, baby sister.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Hi, Nina. Nice work.
- John. Thanks.
- I've got something to tell you.
- Okay.
Did you hear that the Ledger's got a new owner?
I heard.
Nice guy.
Play golf with him on a regular basis.
So?
So if that part-time marina job gets a little old, let me know.
- I could mention your name.
- Don't do me any favors, Renick.
Hello, Mr. Barber.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm just checking my facts.
Well?
I'm in.
Saturday night.
I got everything worked out.
The girl knows exactly what to do.
And what do I do?
All right. You make sure your husband finds this Sunday morning in the paper.
It has a lock of Odette's hair and a ransom note.
That and a phone call should convince him that this is the real deal.
And then?
And then just try to act like a grief-stricken stepmother.
Hey, I'd like a cola.
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)
Bartender.
This is for the Coke.
All right.
ODETTE: Hey, fuckface, watch it!
- Fuckface?
- ODETTE: Look what you did!
- You put a fucking dent in my door.
- Look, I'm sorry.
- No, fuck sorry! You can just pay for it.
- Give me a break.
- MAN: I didn't dent your door.
- Yes, you did.
That's gonna cost me
100 bucks to get fixed.
- HARRY: Let it go.
- I'm not gonna give you $100, young lady.
- Your fucking deductible's more than that.
- This is not good.
- ODETTE: Don't fuck with me, mister!
- Don't screw around with me.
Have you lost your mind?
Get the wig.
Now you've done it. Come on.
Come on!
Son of a bitch!
HARRY: Way to go.
He hit my car!
HARRY: Yeah, so?
Have Daddy buy you another one.
ODETTE: Yeah. What would you do if some jerk-off put a dent in your door?
Well, I would ignore it... because now, not only are we late, we have a witness.
Don't worry, he didn't see you.
- You can't be sure of that.
- Don't worry.
I'm worried, okay? I'm worried.
I'm very, very worried.
You know, Rhea told me you were gonna get paid $50,000 for this.
So?
You know what I said?
"If he's collecting 10 times that much,
"what makes you think he won't take all the money and run?"
This lipstick does not go with red hair.
Anyway, she said you wouldn't do that because you were predictably dishonest.
She said that?
I think she meant it as a compliment.
Well, Harry Barber, are you predictable?
You know, I used to write for the Palmetto Ledger.
I don't read the newspaper.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Anyway, I was covering a none too exciting meeting in the city council,
I step out back to have a smoke, and I notice there's this brand new car out there. Expensive, foreign.
You know, the kind like your daddy might drive, but unusual in Palmetto.
And then I see another new car.
A big Lincoln.
I see another one and another one, and pretty soon I notice there's half a dozen shiny new cars, all parked in spots reserved for the city council.
What's wrong with shiny new cars?
Well, nothing, except I discover that they just voted to allow gambling boats to dock at Palmetto.
So, the zoning commission's in on it, the cops.
It's a big story.
I write it up. I drop it on the editor's desk.
Next day I come in, and the owner of the paper himself calls me into his office.
I think he's gonna pin a medal on me.
Instead, he hands me a box of ashes.
- All my hard work.
- Cocksucker.
And he tells me,
"Harry, I can't print your story.
"Take the money and forget you ever knew what a gambling boat was."
Corruption at City Hall. What a shock.
Yeah, well, the shock came when that $10,000 ended up in an account with my name on it.
So instead of a Pulitzer Prize, I end up serving two years of a four-year sentence.
And that did it, huh?
The next time someone made you a large offer of small bills, you're gonna take the money and run.
- Am I right?
- You know, you're very intuitive for someone your age.
All right, tell me what you're gonna do.
- Not again.
- Well, just come on.
I buy a ticket using cash in the name Anne Hardaway.
When I get to Miami,
I check into the airport Holiday Inn. Yuck!
And I don't come out of my room till I hear from you.
All right, that's good.
Get going.
You know, Harry Barber, you don't look predictable.
But I guess I'm just not a very good judge of character.
How's that?
I bet Rhea $100 you wouldn't take the money out of her purse.
And, you see, I lost.
HARRY: Why?
Why didn't I pull out right then and there?
I've asked myself that question a thousand times.
Still I don't know why.
I understand.
I will pay.
How do you want me to hand you the money?
I'll have it by tomorrow.
I'll have it by tomorrow.
Please don't hurt her.
You'll get your money.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Thank you.
Well, I hope this suits you a little better.
Oh, it's just perfect.
No, it's good, I mean, it's really good.
Mr. Barber?
Yeah.
Assistant DA Renick would like you to come to the courthouse.
What'd I do?
Nothing that I know, sir.
I mean, am I under arrest, or...
Not that I know of, sir.
Hey, Harry. Come on in.
Look. Sorry for the early wake-up call.
But I wanted to get you in on this as soon as possible.
Let me introduce you to my boss.
Harry Barber,
District Attorney Miles Meadows.
Boss, this is Harry Barber.
How are you, Barber?
Well, I'd be a heck of a lot better if I knew what I was doing in the DA's office at 9:00 on a Sunday morning.
Do you ever hear of a man named Felix Malrow?
Malroux.
With an "x", right?
I think it's French or something.
Sorry, Harry. No smoking, public facility.
- It's against the law.
- Of course.
So did you ever hear of this guy or what?
Just that he's rich.
He's very rich.
Well, there's no law against that, is there?
I got a call early this morning from a banker acquaintance of mine.
Seems this Malroux was especially anxious to get his hands on $500,000 in small bills as soon as possible.
So?
Tell him about the girl.
Malrow... Malroux has got a daughter. Very young, 16, 17.
She went to meet a friend last night and never came home.
Maybe she eloped.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Well, so maybe this Malroux is a lousy poker player.
Maybe he wants to wallpaper his bathroom.
Harry, Malroux's bodyguard is an ex-cop.
I just spoke to him an hour ago.
He confirmed the girl did not come home last night.
He also said the first sign of trouble was last night.
They received a call from the girlfriend wondering where she was.
And this morning,
Malroux received a ransom note and a lock of his daughter's hair tucked inside the Sunday paper.
There was also a phone call in the middle of the night from someone claiming to have the girl.
That sounds convincing.
So you still haven't told me what it is you called me down here for.
Sooner or later the press is gonna get a hold of this.
You know exactly what that means.
We need somebody to handle it, act as the press liaison for the DA's office.
Course, you'll be on the payroll.
You're offering me a job.
So, why me?
Renick told me all about you, Barber.
Told me what they did to you.
We need somebody like you.
Somebody with integrity.
Somebody who's incorruptible.
You know the press, you're one of them.
I don't want this thing to turn ugly, become a circus.
The stakes are too high.
That's right. It's an election year.
JOHN: Look, Harry,
Malroux hasn't come to us yet.
That's why we can't act.
At least not officially anyway.
I mean, that's why this thing has gotta be handled very carefully.
I mean, once the press sinks their teeth into this thing, there's no telling what might happen to the girl.
What do you say? Will you do it?
Sure. Glad to help.
Thanks for coming down, Harry.
Sure. Pleasure.
So, we'll set you up in here.
There won't be too much to do right now, but I got a feeling this is just the calm before the storm. Okay?
- Hey, thanks, Renick.
- Yeah.
I owe you one.
Is that gratitude?
Let's just say that you and Palmetto are even now, all right?
(HOW BIZZARE PLAYING LOUDLY)
Hello?
- It's me.
- Who?
Turn that damn thing down.
Is that you, Harry Barber?
Listen to me. The jig is up.
We're calling the whole thing off.
What do you mean "off"?
I mean, off as in over, kaput, done, finished.
I think you're scared.
You're damn right I'm scared.
The cops know all about this.
Get your ass on a plane and get back here.
You understand?
Not until you get me my money.
Listen, you.
I'm the one calling the shots around here.
No, Harry Barber.
You're just the hired help.
Now if you don't get me my money,
I'm gonna have to do something stupid and adolescent.
Like, call the police and tell them what you did to me in that bungalow.
Oh, God.
Thanks.
Something on your mind, Harry?
The girl.
Odette Malroux?
You guys act like you got the biggest kidnap case since the Lindbergh baby. No offense, but you might be off on a wild-goose chase.
Believe me, the thought has crossed my mind.
I wouldn't be surprised if she showed up and announced it was all a big joke.
Oh, I'd like that.
Yeah, hello.
What? Oh, no, no.
All right. Yeah.
Our ex-cop.
He said the girl just telephoned her father, told him that if he didn't pay the ransom, she'd be sent home one piece at a time.
Still think this is a joke, Harry?
I guess not.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go. I have to get my typewriter.
I can't use these computers.
We can dig you up a typewriter around here, no problem.
No, no. That's all right.
You know, I gotta use my own.
Call me superstitious.
Sure, go ahead.
- Just stick near a phone, all right?
- You got it.
Hello.
HARRY: People I was worried would get involved are already involved.
Where can I meet you?
The beach.
Okay, I'll be there in 20 minutes.
What seems to be the problem,
Mr. Barber?
How the hell did you get in here?
Easy. The door was wide open.
The cops are involved.
Oh.
- How did that happen?
- Yeah, you tell me.
For starters, that pit bull of yours, Donnelly, is an ex-cop, or didn't you know that?
How would I?
Maybe the same way you knew that I'd take that money out of your purse.
You know, you can't believe everything Odette says.
Oh, yeah, speaking of, that silly little stepdaughter of yours is taking matters into her own hands.
- She telephoned...
- Her father. Yeah, I know.
- How did you know that?
- Yeah, how did you know that?
Yeah, well, never mind how I know.
You said your husband wasn't gonna involve the authorities.
- Yeah, well, he isn't!
- Somebody has!
Well, it wasn't him.
He's a sick man. He loves his daughter.
He's not about to trust the police.
What I don't understand is why the hell he'd wanna trust you.
RHEA: Get off of me!
The money's there.
It's all there. It's at the house.
The president of the bank dropped it off himself.
It's $500,000!
Come on.
Unless you're not up to it.
Maybe we should call the whole thing off.
Fine.
You know, this still could work.
It's gotta be tonight.
I'll set a time and a place.
After I make the pickup,
I'm gonna call the house.
You make sure that you answer.
If anybody asks, you tell them you're going to see Odette.
We meet back here, we split up the money.
Unless, of course, you don't trust me.
I trust you.
HARRY: Just remember, watch what you say.
Donnelly's an ear for the police.
I'll be careful.
What took you so long?
He needed a little encouragement.
How?
- Fax for Miss Hardaway.
- Thanks.
I take it back, Harry Barber.
You are predictable.
Yeah, you there?
Pick up. It's me.
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't get to you sooner.
It's a busy day, and it's like the crime of the century's going on down at the DA's office, and Renick wants me to be press liaison.
I can't talk about it, but I just...
Well, I'm gonna be late.
I'm gonna be very late, so don't wait up.
Bye-bye.
Okay. In an hour this'll all be over with.
You'll have your money.
And you'll have yours.
All right, get on in there and wait for me.
You know,
I can't help but think about what happened in that bungalow the other day.
What are you talking about?
Nothing happened.
I know.
It's a shame.
You sure you don't want me to come along?
The instructions said to come alone.
I can't risk my child's life.
Okay.
Yes. Yes! Yes!
Yes!
We did it.
We sure as hell did it.
Hey.
You want to check this out?
Wake up, sleeping beauty.
What are you, drunk?
Odette.
You're a fucking idiot.
Straight back to jail.
Straight back.
You fucking did it.
Twenty years.
Christ, you did it!
Come on! Come on!
Just light!
Just light!
Fuck!
Fuck!
(MOUTHS) Son of a bitch.
You all right under there?
Oh, yeah, I...
You know, I took my eye off the road for one second and I slid into a guardrail.
- Been drinking?
- No, I don't drink.
- This yours?
- Girlfriend's.
Sir, let me see your license and registration, please.
Okay.
You know, I work at the DA's office.
I don't know if it's too late, but maybe you could contact the assistant DA, John Renick, there.
He could vouch for me.
You mean the John Renick?
You know him?
- Yeah. We went to the Academy together.
- Oh, God.
He's my girl... My wife...
No, my girlfriend's sister's boy...
Husband.
- He's a good cop.
- A great cop, according to him.
Look, I got an idea.
Why don't you open up that trunk there?
We'll get the spare out and I'll help you fix that tire.
- Okay.
- All right.
You know, the spare is no...
It's no good. It's no good, the spare.
Well, you sure?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm...
No, I'm positive. It's...
My girlfriend had a flat.
Well.
We might better check and take a look-see.
Maybe she got it fixed.
No. She wouldn't, 'cause she's...
You know women.
They don't care about spare tires. They...
I know women.
Well, it'd be foolish not to check, though.
No, but I know my girlfriend. She...
Why don't we just pop her open anyway, take a look?
Might be surprised at what we find.
Go on, open her up.
Okay.
Shit!
Well, I'll be damned!
How about them bananas?
Done broke it off. I'll tell you what, I'll...
I'll just call you a tow truck, all right?
- Thanks.
- You bet.
- Very kind.
- You're welcome.
Thanks.
Here's $10, $25, that's $30.
Thirty? That's 50 bucks for the tow.
- Fifty bucks! Give me a break.
- Fifty bucks.
Hey, that car's not coming off the hook until after you pay me.
Come on.
- All right, I'll be right back.
- I'll be here.
NINA: Is that you, Harry?
HARRY: Go back to sleep, baby.
John? Yeah, here he is. Hold on.
Harry.
Harry, it's John on the phone.
Yeah.
JOHN: Harry, there's a new development.
Mr. Malroux just called us.
His daughter didn't show up.
So now we're officially involved.
We need you to write a statement, a press release.
Okay.
I'll be right there.
Oh, hey, I need someone to pick me up.
- Yeah, just sit tight.
- Thanks.
What's happening?
This case I've been working on, is a kidnapping case, and the girl who was kidnapped, the money was given, but she was never returned. And now...
Seems to really be affecting you.
Did you know her?
No, but it's... Of course not.
So, that why you started drinking again?
I mean, a guy's entitled to a drink every once in a while.
You were the one who said it affected your judgment.
Yeah. Well, I was wrong.
My judgment's as bad as it ever was.
What's going on, Harry?
Tell me.
Nina...
HARRY: So, what was it that finally got Malroux to call in the cavalry?
JOHN: Wife talked him into it.
HARRY: His wife?
JOHN: It's about time, too.
We've already been in touch with the FBI.
They're sending up an agent this afternoon.
MALROUX: Stop here.
- It was exactly here, Mr. Renick.
- Right there?
I set the odometer when I left home.
Let's go check that out.
Come on, let's go!
Hey, over here!
All right. Get some plastic on that.
We need that thing protected.
That's a footprint. Great.
All right.
Hey, Harry.
Harry, come here. Put your foot over next to this print here, will you?
What size shoe are you wearing?
HARRY: Same size as the kidnapper, looks like.
JOHN: Come on, where's that plastic?
OFFICER: Hey, I got tire tracks!
JOHN: All I can tell you, he was no pro, that's for sure.
Whole thing's sloppy, half-assed, and from what I know already, not very well thought out.
I bet he's local.
Let's get somebody on these tracks!
We don't want them covered up.
Hey, hey, hey. Harry, come on.
It could be important evidence you're standing on there, all right?
Sorry.
Am I still needed, Mr. Renick?
JOHN: Yes, sir.
I'll be right there, Mr. Malroux.
Hey, who is that guy with Malroux?
That's Donnelly.
He's the ex-cop I was telling you about.
- Looks familiar.
- Maybe you remember his face from TV.
He was the bagman for that crooked bunch down at City Hall.
He plea-bargained his way out of doing any jail time, but he still had to quit the force.
Hey, Harry.
It was his testimony that sprung you out of prison.
Damn!
Told you they'd be all over this like shit on a stick.
Well, it's time for you to earn your keep, my friend.
Get out there and keep them off me, brother.
In-law.
- There'll be a press conference upstairs...
- Are you involved in this, Mr. Barber?
...in three minutes.
Hello.
My name's Harry Barber.
I'll be the press liaison for the DA's office.
I used to be one of you, so I know how anxious you are to get going, but I'd like to ask that everybody turn off their cameras and turn off their tape-recording devices, please.
Do as I'm asking you, please...
You see, I...
The DA's office and the police department...
How come they let you out of jail, Harry?
...have asked that you hold off on your story for the next 24 hours.
Why? Why is that, Harry?
We don't know a heck of a lot more than you do.
Pretty much what you all received in your statement.
And, thank you.
So the district attorney doesn't want to jeopardize this girl's situation if we break this story too soon.
Come on, Harry. We're not just talking about a kidnapping case, we're talking about a murder case.
That's not true, Ernie.
- Do they have a suspect?
- No.
ERNIE: If they don't now, they will soon.
Right, Harry?
If the girl's already dead, then why are we sitting on this story?
ERNIE: They're just trying to flush the killer out. Right, Harry?
Come on, Harry. Throw us a bone.
JOHN: Kind of rough, huh, Harry?
(LAUGHS) Oh!
You know the press, they think they know everything.
But they're gonna cooperate though, right?
Yeah, for now.
What about you? Anything I should know?
Well, we sent the ransom note and the drop-off instructions to the FBI.
We're just gonna have to wait and see what they come up with.
What do you mean? Like fingerprints?
Fingerprints?
Harry, the guy's dumb, not brain-dead.
They'll take saliva samples from the envelopes, the cigarette butt we found, profile his DNA with it.
DNA?
(CHUCKLES) They can do that?
Don't you watch TV?
Anyway, come this way.
There's something more concrete
I want to show you.
You know, some people might call this luck.
I like to look at it as good investigative work.
Checked the routine police report the night the girl was taken.
Oh, it's hot.
This guy was discovered out cold in the parking lot, right next to where they found the girl's car.
Somebody gave him a great thump on the head.
Is that right?
I look like hell.
And he had receding brownish-blonde hair.
He was about that tall.
Had to be about...
God, he had to be about yea wide.
And he had kind of a small but longish face.
Jesus, Harry.
He could be talking about you.
Yeah, me and a hundred other guys.
- I'm gonna grab some lunch.
- Yeah. All right. Go ahead.
...it turned out to be a red wig.
I almost forgot. Nina called, said she couldn't find her car keys.
The car.
Nina!
Harry?
Are you here?
Do you have the keys? I need my car.
What are you doing?
What are you doing with that briefcase?
Nothing, I just...
It doesn't concern you, Nina.
Harry, if it concerns you, it concerns me.
Not this time.
- Tell me what's in the briefcase, Harry.
- Nothing's in the briefcase.
What's going on?
Nina, nothing is going on. Nothing.
This is about that girl, isn't it?
The one that was kidnapped.
Nina, I need a few minutes alone, right now.
- Where are you going?
- I need to take my car.
- No, no, not now.
- Why not, Harry?
- Just not now, Nina.
- Harry, what is going on?
Nothing! Nothing's going on!
Nothing! Okay?
Nothing!
It's the girl, isn't it?
Nina...
Harry, you answer me.
The girl, she's in the garage, isn't she?
Dead?
Did you kill her?
No.
I didn't kill anybody.
Oh, God,
I knew something was wrong, Harry, but...
Now you see why I didn't want to get you involved.
Okay.
All right. What do we do now?
Well, one thing's for sure.
We gotta get rid of the body.
Oh, God, Harry, don't talk like that.
I'm sorry, Nina. I'm not a good little Scout lost in the woods. Not anymore.
We gotta rent a car and dump the body somewhere.
We have all the money we need right here.
Oh, God.
I thought I was one step ahead of her the whole time.
She played me like a game of Chinese chess.
Checkers.
Are you talking about Rhea Malroux?
All she wanted was the girl dead and somebody to pin it on.
Why?
I don't know. It doesn't make sense.
Unless she wanted the whole fortune to herself after the old man dies.
- You think she killed her daughter?
- Stepdaughter. Not a chance.
Maybe there's somebody else involved.
Maybe Rhea Malroux's got a friend.
Donnelly.
Who's that?
Don't answer it. Don't answer it.
That'll be John Renick.
It's only a matter of time before he puts two and two together and comes up with the name Harry Barber.
Harry, why don't you tell John what happened? He'll believe you.
What, believe what? That I was gonna extort a half a million dollars from Felix Malroux and not kill his daughter?
It's the truth.
Yeah. It'll be Rhea Malroux's word against mine.
What?
HARRY: Rhea Malroux's word.
No, no, no.
I've got a message from Harry Barber.
Who's Harry Barber?
Maybe this will ring a bell.
RHEA ON TAPE: My stepdaughter is going to be kidnapped.
The ransom will be $500,000.
I need someone to be the threatening voice on the telephone.
For making the call and for collecting the ransom, I'm willing to pay...
- I've heard enough.
- ... 10%.
What does this have to do with me?
NINA: You're fucking Rhea Malroux, for starters.
So what do you want?
There's a body of a girl in the trunk of my car.
It needs to be taken care of or somebody's gonna find it.
- And if it's taken care of?
- Then nobody needs to hear the tape, and you can go on fucking Rhea Malroux.
I expect to hear from you.
I'm not the only one who's been fucking Rhea Malroux.
Maybe you should listen to the rest of your tape, sweetheart.
RHEA ON TAPE: In all of this excitement,
Mr. Barber,
I don't remember hearing whether you were in or out.
(RHEA MOANING)
HARRY: In all this excitement,
I don't remember saying.
RHEA ON TAPE: I need to know.
Time is of the essence.
(RHEA SIGHING)
Hey, where have you been?
I've been on pins and needles.
I listened to the tape, Harry.
- All of it.
- Nina...
It's not what you think.
It didn't mean anything.
It sounded sincere.
Well, yeah. Nina, Nina...
Harry, I don't understand why.
I don't understand. Why did you do this?
I don't know. She...
She's a beautiful woman.
I'm not talking about Rhea Malroux.
Everything. Everything. I don't understand.
Don't tell me you did it for the money.
- No, I didn't do it for the money.
- Then why?
Well, I guess I felt like somebody owed me something for those two years. This is my way...
NINA: Well, well.
If it isn't the missing link.
HARRY: You know, I'm not surprised you're mixed up in all this, Donnelly.
A snake can't change the fact that it crawls on its belly for a living.
Sticks and stones, Barber.
Now, give me the tape.
Now, look.
You take the body, you get the tape.
That's the deal.
No, no, no. I'm making the fucking deals around here, all right, Harry?
Give me the tape.
- Now, give me the other one.
- What other one?
What other one?
You met Odette alone in that bungalow.
If you taped Rhea, you taped the girl.
Well, Harry?
Did you tape the girl, too?
Nina...
Now, about that problem of yours.
Here's the solution.
This stuff dissolves the flesh off of bones, then dissolves the bones just like piss on a snowman.
DONNELLY: Harry, give me a hand.
All right, give me a hand.
You want to play, you gotta pay.
HARRY: Oh, Jesus!
You got a bathtub?
- Yeah, why?
- Where's the bathtub?
- Why?
- For her.
You're gonna do this here?
- DONNELLY: We're doing it here.
- No, you can't do it here!
You know what, we'll use that.
- HARRY: No, no, no. Take her out.
- It's happening, Harry.
- HARRY: Not here!
- We're doing it. Shut up! Okay?
HARRY: You shut up!
It's gonna take a couple of minutes.
Shit! Don't get it! Don't get it!
Don't answer it! Don't answer it!
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Just keep the water running, Harry.
DONNELLY: Your phone's ringing.
Want me to get that?
I almost forgot, Harry.
Guess you earned it.
Goodbye.
Counting your money, Harry?
I don't know how you can even stand to touch it.
Fuck you!
Taking kind of a long lunch, aren't you, Harry?
Get in.
Buckle your seat belt.
So what do you think, Harry?
About what?
JOHN: Don't tell me you haven't heard?
They found her.
They found who?
Odette Malroux.
In a bungalow down at East Beach.
Right under our noses the whole time.
Let's go, Harry.
We're live here at East Beach, and this is Harry Barber...
Harry, did you know it was Malroux's daughter? Did you know she was dead?
Did you know she was dead, Harry?
Harry, are you involved in this?
Come on, come on.
Meadows is waiting on us. Let's go.
ERNIE: Would you give us a statement?
FEMALE OFFICER: Hey.
It's seaweed.
Mr. Malroux, I hate to do this to you, sir, but it's very important.
Let's get on with it.
Is this your daughter, Odette?
Mr. Renick, this is Billy Holden. He manages the place.
JOHN: Was it you that called this in?
BILLY: Yes, sir.
The maid found her a little while ago.
Was the girl renting the bungalow?
BILLY: No, sir.
JOHN: Who was?
Harry Barber.
Get him.
Harry!
Harry, stop!
Oh, my God! My God!
- MAN: I'll get you a doctor.
- No, no, no. No doctors.
Don't think anything's broke.
You probably hurt that old truck more than it hurt you.
But that gunshot wound's another matter.
It might be best if you just gave yourself up.
HARRY: I was hoping the rain was gonna wash a way the whole dirty business.
And me right along with it.
HARRY: Thank you.
HARRY: I was in it right up to my ears,
and had no idea how the hell I was gonna get myself out.
There was only one thing I could do.
JOHN: Harry.
I've been waiting for you, Harry.
Yeah. I'm sure you have.
I have a boat.
We can go away together.
Just you and me.
Why don't I believe you?
Nobody was supposed to get killed.
Tell that to Odette Malroux.
It was Donnelly.
He's such an animal.
I'm so scared!
Will you hold me?
I need you so much.
No.
Not this time.
Somebody's gotta pay the piper.
It's not gonna be me.
Where's your husband?
- Upstairs?
- You're not gonna tell him.
- Yeah, yeah. I think he deserves to know.
- No, Harry, he'll kill you.
- Better him than the State of Florida.
- What about us?
Us?
Where does somebody like you come from?
I'm just a girl with a little ambition.
A little ambition?
We're no different!
You and me, Harry, we're the same.
HARRY: That's where you're wrong.
Who are you?
My name's Harry Barber.
Do I know you?
We have a mutual acquaintance or two, yes.
What do you want?
My neck is in a noose and I gotta get it out.
And you're my only chance.
Does this have something to do with my daughter?
Unfortunately, sir, it's got everything to do with your daughter.
Do you know who killed her?
Yes, I do.
I am waiting.
Well...
I know you got no reason to believe me, but I promise you it was...
Should I call the police, sir?
Continue, Mr. Barber.
Your wife and Donnelly.
- Look, I know you don't want to believe...
- He's lying, sir.
I know you got no reason to believe me, but it's true.
- They suckered me...
- Shut up!
...into this phony kidnapping thing.
- And then they killed your daughter.
- He's lying, sir!
And they did it for money.
They're in on this together.
- HARRY: I swear to God.
- Shut up!
Rhea?
Could you come in here?
Please.
I don't like doing this.
My wife is very upset.
It's an act, I'm telling you.
Your wife and this guy killed your daughter.
Who is that?
That's not your wife.
That can't be your wife.
DONNELLY: Shut up!
Although this is a death penalty state,
Mr. Barber,
I won't live long enough to see you die for the murder of my daughter.
I didn't kill your daughter.
Make sure he isn't found.
HARRY: I didn't do it.
- Ever.
- HARRY: I swear to God I didn't kill her.
Listen to me! Wait! I didn't do it.
I'm telling you...
Malroux, I...
(MUFFLED) I didn't kill your daughter.
I didn't do it!
Help me!
You had to get her involved, didn't you, dumb fuck?
RHEA: Hi, Harry.
- Rhea Malroux.
- You know the wife, Harry.
To be.
Intimately.
DONNELLY: For your information, she said you were lousy, just like your writing.
I did not say lousy, I said predictable.
Like showing up tonight at Malroux's.
She figured you would.
RHEA: It's not rocket science.
Guy coming out of prison on a bum charge is gonna want to even the score a little.
It's only human nature.
The wife's good at that human nature stuff.
She's not bad at the physical stuff either.
But you, Harry, you just couldn't keep your shirt on, could you?
RHEA: Or his pants.
Flash a little green under your nose, and a little pink, and you were panting like a big dog on a hot day.
Yeah, so I'm a sucker, me and that poor girl you had playing like she was Odette Malroux.
She was very cute.
And a good little actress, wasn't she?
Some runaway from the Midwest.
Idaho, I think.
- That's the Northwest, hon.
- Who cares?
Nobody's gonna see her again anyway.
I can't believe that you killed her and Odette Malroux just for the ransom money.
DONNELLY: Listen to you, Barber, a guy so broke his fucking cash bounces.
Five hundred thousand bucks is five hundred thousand bucks.
You always were small time, Donnelly.
Fuck you with a pile driver, Harry.
Hon?
Which one do you think for the plane ride?
I feel, I don't know, dark and mysterious.
- DONNELLY: I don't know. Surprise me.
- Okay.
DONNELLY: The little lady and I are going to Vegas to get married, take some R and R.
HARRY: Get the fuck off me.
Mr. Malroux gave us the week off, and his blessings, sweetheart.
- HARRY: Mr. Malroux?
- Yeah. That's how we met, Harry.
I do the cooking and the cleaning
- and take care of the old man.
- See, she does the gardening, too.
Rosemary, herbs, all that sort of thing.
- I've always been a working girl.
- I'll bet.
I gotta hand it to you, Barber.
When you showed up at the doorstep that day,
I thought you blew the whole deal.
You know, you got a fucking knack for that.
I had a damn good thing going when I was a cop.
Good thing till you fucked it all up.
You couldn't just take the money, could you?
Not Harry Barber. He's Mr. Clean.
DONNELLY: No. You just don't learn, do you, Barber?
- Maybe next time...
- You're out of next times, Sunny Jim.
You understand me?
Well, I guess this is goodbye.
Can I have a moment?
This must be what you want.
I'm gonna miss you.
Okay, lovebugs, that's enough.
You don't really think she's gonna marry you, do you?
- You talk too much, Barber.
- She ain't gonna marry you, I promise you.
(MUFFLED) She's gonna fuck you over...
You know, the world is full of Harry Barbers.
Guys who want to play in the big leagues, but just don't have the talent.
My advice to you, Harry, is don't go in the deep end if you can't swim.
Hey, what're you doing, Harry?
You want to fucking play games?
You want to make this painful?
What is that?
Is that a wire? You wearing a wire?
Hold it, Donnelly!
MALE OFFICER: Clear!
- Check the back.
- JOHN: Get her! Take care of her!
OFFICER: Check upstairs.
All right, I got you.
- Where have you been?
- We were right outside.
That could've been me, man.
JOHN: It could've been you, but it isn't you, all right?
That could've been me!
But it isn't you, Harry!
We had to make this look good if it was gonna be believable.
HARRY: You were late!
That could've been me.
JOHN: Jesus Christ! What?
Hi, baby.
I love you.
You okay?
You did it, Barber. Nice work.
Free at last.
- Read him his rights.
- What're you doing? What?
Conspiracy to kidnap, accessory to extortion, Harry,
- hindering an investigation.
- This was my idea.
The whole wire thing. I got you re-elected!
FEMALE OFFICER: Over here!
FEMALE OFFICER: Come on out of there!
MALE OFFICER: Open the door!
Hello.
Would you mind, please, holding my bag for me?
MALE OFFICER: Move it!
HARRY: This isn't right, Renick.
I helped you out, you know it.
- This isn't right. We had a deal.
- Let's go. Let's go. Get her out of here.
- Take them downtown.
- Move it! Move it, come on!
- Let's go. Let's go.
- This isn't right.
HARRY: Well, I'm back in prison,
back with my little friends.
It's part of the deal I cut with Renick.
But it isn't going to be for long.
The way I figure, just long enough for me to write my story.
And then, who knows?
They might even turn it into a movie.
[English - SDH]
OK. It's Monday morning.
Your name is M.L. Pogue.
Maurice Leonard.
Pogue is fine.
You live in Venice.
That's Venice, California.
You have an office just off the boardwalk.
You're a small -time gumshoe-- credit reports, insurance scams, that kind of stuff.
Nothing you'd call... adventurous.
Right now, you're on vacation temporarily.
You're unable to take any cases due to illness.
You have a dog.
He has a depth perception problem.
But don't worry about the dog.
He can take care of himself.
It's you that's got the problem, pal-- a problem called
Korsakoff's syndrome.
OK. Are you ready for this?
Whenever you go to sleep, you lose your memory.
What?
Whenever you go to sleep, you Lose your memory.
-Shit.
-Now, don't get upset.
You're bound to feel a little disorientated at first... but, really, don't panic.
You've got a system.
As long as you talk into this recorder every night... everything's going to be fine.
OK. Here's what happened.
Two months ago, you were injured working on a case.
-There was an explosion.
-Are you my dog?
That's what's causing this amnesia every night... so be careful.
There may be complications.
Wait. It gets worse.
You can't tell anyone about the amnesia.
You're the key witness against the guy who set the explosion.
If anyone finds out your memory's gone... the whole case could collapse.
The best thing you can do is stay in your apartment.
Don't show your face around town... don't talk to strangers... and above all don't answer the door.
I repeat--don't talk to anyone.
Just stay in bed.
Shh! They're following me.
They want to kill me.
Who's trying to kill you?
Cornell. The FBI.
I don't know.
What--what are you doing?
I'm calling the police, as soon as I find the phone.
-No. You can't.
-Why?
-I don't trust them.
-Who?
-I need you.
-I'm not taking any cases.
Thank you.
Well, I can listen.
-You're mad at me.
-No, I'm not.
-You are.
-Really, no.
-You can't lie to me.
-AII right, I'm a Little mad.
Pogue, you've got to believe
I missed you.
I didn't want you to suffer.
Oh, do you believe me?
Yes, I believe you.
Did you think I was dead?
Should I have?
Yes, I--I did think you were dead.
Will you kiss me?
AII right.
Down!
You want to run that by me again?
I'm being blackmailed.
-Uh, by who?
-I honesty don't know.
I got a note telling me to come to L.A.
If I didn't, they'd tell Cornell where I was.
I'm supposed to phone them in two days, set up a meeting.
Uh, who, uh, followed you...
-B-Beth?
-You can use my real name.
Good, yeah. I will.
I don't know. I didn't get a good look at him.
-He was big.
-Big?
By the way, how's Dolby doing?
Dolby?
Oh, he's, uh, great.
Really?
I heard he was shot.
Uh, except for that. Yeah.
And he was dying.
Yeah, yeah, but, uh, he looks great now... and he's jogging and playing tennis. He's good.
So he's out of the wheelchair?
-But?
-It's, uh...
-But then, what--
-It's a new wheelchair.
They just invented it.
It's water-powered.
Really?
Look, could we not talk about this right now... because, like, it's really sad for me, OK?
-Who's that?
-It's the police, Mr. Pogue.
It's the police.
Don't tell them I'm here.
Don't.
I need you, Pogue.
Mr. Pogue?
Would you step outside,
Mr. Pogue?
What is it?
Turn around, please, Mr. Pogue.
Get your hands behind your back,
Mr. Pogue.
Let's go.
Come on.
What do you think?
What's it going to be?
The Mona Lisa.
How's it going, Pogue?
Just great.
-You want the joke of the day?
-Sure.
Why don't blind people sky-dive?
Why?
It scares the shit out their dogs.
That's funny.
Mr. Pogue!
Mr. Pogue, the rent!
The rent, Mr. Pogue!
If it's not too much to ask, what'd I do?
-Stay here.
-Right here.
Surprise!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Pogue
I told you I'd get you.
Happy birthday to you
Make a wish.
Speech!
I, uh...
I just want to thank everyone for their effort here.
Thank you.
-More!
-No!
Come on!
Seeing all your... faces here today... brings back such... memories.
It's hard to know where to begin.
Start with the girls!
Jealous, Bob?
You old dog, Bob!
Sure, I could talk about Bob...
John and Susan and Mary...
Mary and--and Fred and Ethel and Little Ricky... and all the others... whose friendship means so much to me... but that wouldn’t be fair.
I'm reminded of a story.
A story about.... about guts... and blood.
Blood and guts and patriotism.
And love.
Let's not forget Love.
That-a-way!
I think we all know who I'm talking about.
I'm not going to embarrass them by mentioning their name... but what sacrifice, huh?
When they went into the... the thing with the... the guy in the-- you know, the flames... and the running the back with the thing and the...
Next thing, they're getting up in the middle of the night.
Who knew?
There's an old joke that goes... why don't blind people sky-dive?
Is it irrelevant?
I don't think so.
Call me old-fashioned, call me irresistible... call me late for lunch... but I think grabbing the initiative... overcoming handicaps, and, yes, even skydiving blind... are the true virtues, hmm?
I'm sure you have your own stories.
Raise your hand if you have your own story.
Come on, put 'em up.
Yeah, a lot of stories... a Lot of hands... which is to say...
I have a rare group of friends.
Thank you.
-Guess who!
-I'm not real good at this.
-Come on, guess.
-Let the man go, Judy.
-Judy.
-No fair, Dolby, no fair.
How's it going, Pogue?
Uh, pretty good.
I ran into a friend of ours this morning.
-Who's that?
-Sarah Novak.
What? Sarah Novak. What?
Come over here.
Listen, Pogue, I've seen a Lot of innocent people... killed in my time, and
I'm haunted by them constantly.
But Sarah is dead, Pogue.
You're alive.
Stop torturing yourself with it.
Stop talking to Sarah.
Concentrate on putting that bastard Cornell in jail, OK?
You nervous about Thursday?
Thursday?
Remember, be yourself on cross-examination.
Tell it Like you know.
Like I know.
-Right, counselor?
-That's right.
Nobody's gotten that close to
Cornell before--not till now.
Either wind up dead or bought or in a wheelchair.
But not you, Pogue.
Too Late to rent a hall.
Listen, I need to ask a favor as a friend.
Sure.
I think my fiancée’s cheating on me.
I know what you're thinking,
''Rosenheim, you're paranoid.''
But that's not it.
I want to hire you.
I need to hire you.
I'm not taking any cases right now.
-I'm desperate.
-I'm real busy.
-Listen, she's making me crazy.
-I'm on vacation.
Just find out who she's sleeping with. That's all I ask.
May I borrow the birthday boy for a sec?
Actually, we were talking.
Come on, come on, come on.
You're supposed to be resting.
Open your mouth.
I told you I would keep your amnesia confidential... but if you're gonna be running around... making an ass of yourself...
Turn your head.
You need some stability.
You need settle down.
You need to relax.
Find a woman, somebody to help you get through this thing.
Look up. If you keep up this life of high adventure... this amnesia's going to be permanent.
Look down. The best place for you right now is home-- familiar surroundings, people you know.
I'm surrounded by people I know.
That's my problem.
Now, who are they?
Hey...who are you?
-I'm your doctor.
-You are?
Anthony Doover.
We're friends.
We play tennis on Saturdays.
Doover, Doover. And the guy you were just talking to?
Rosenheim. Donald Rosenheim.
He's the assistant D.A.
You worked together on the force.
Rosenheim, assistant D.A.
And the guy in the wheelchair?
John Dolby. He's the D.A.
Dolby. D.A.
Sarah Novak?
Don't think about her, Pogue.
You're feeling guilty.
About what? What?
Listen, you're never gonna get over this amnesia... until you come to grips with what happened.
Would you just tell me what happened?
Go home. Go to bed.
Don't move.
AII right. Zip up.
Why, thank you.
We haven't met formally, have we, Mr. Pogue?
Philip Cornell.
You've got no thumb,
Mr. Cornell.
My dad loved art, Mr. Pogue.
He Loved art so much... that when I was kidnapped as a Little boy of 8... the kidnappers threatened to kill me... unless my father surrendered his Rubens--
Descent from the Cross-- a surpassing work, by the way.
Dad called their bluff.
The kidnappers sent my thumb back to him in a box.
What'd your dad do with the thumb?
Does he still have it?
The kidnappers were captured.
The Rubens was undamaged.
Did he freeze the thumb?
They can do--
Could they stop doing that?
Your testimony on Thursday--
I shall be most grateful if you could see your way clear... to have a convenient loss of memory.
This is a statement explaining you were mistaken.
You never saw me at the crime scene.
In turn, we could offer you this.
Is that a comma?
Can I think about this?
Of course.
Till tomorrow morning.
Give us time to make other plans.
This is bad.
I've gotten involved with a Sarah Novak.
She's either in trouble and needs your help... or she's dead... and in a remarkable state of preservation.
OK, According to the file in your office...
Sarah Novak was Philip Cornell's lover.
They were apparently inseparable for five years... till she left him.
Sarah was afraid that
Cornell intended to kill her... for what she knew about his illegal activities.
She decided to testify against him.
She hired a private detective to protect herself.
Yours truly.
The day after the indictment was brought against Cornell...
Sarah was killed.
A car bomb.
You were blown clear.
The only witness.
Oh, good. Let's see.
So, all of this leaves you with an interesting dilemma.
That is bizarre.
Maybe, maybe.
Ow! Ow! Shit.
Dead woman walks into your Life... and now we have a date to meet her at a fashion show.
AII right, two questions.
One--why isn't she dead?
And two-- what am I going to wear tonight?
There's only one way you can get your questions answered... and only one place you can find her.
Excuse me.
Sorry, sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
He's watching me.
So what did the police want?
Um...it's my birthday.
I know. Psst.
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.
These are nice.
Put them on.
Come here.
They seem very you.
You think so?
-Mm-hmm.
-How's that?
Black and white.
Like your anklet?
Yes, Like my ank--
You're a very good detective.
-How do you tell time?
-With difficulty.
-It's broken.
-Why don't you get it fixed?
My grandmother engraved on the back of it...
''Vivi ogni momento al suo massimo.''
Ah, yes. Romanian.
-No, It's Italian.
-I knew that.
That was my second choice.
So, what's it mean?
''Live every second to its fullest.''
I'm doing my part.
Clasp.
Um, do you mind if I ask you a question?
Sure.
Why aren't you dead?
-It wasn't me. It was a double.
-Why?
-Can we handle this later?
-No. Tell me now.
The FBI knew
Cornell was gonna hit me... so they put an agent in just in case.
They didn't expect... ba-boom.
Why would someone want to kill you?
You're on, Beth.
I became Beth Holly of San Francisco, a model.
What do I call you now,
Sarah or Beth?
Sarah.
Someone is threatening to tell
Cornell I'm still alive... unless I give them something.
What? Give them what?
You're on.
What? Give them what?
On display at the end of the hall of archeology... you'll find the oldest coin we now know to exist-- the Coin of Royal Power.
Dating from the year 650 b.c... the coin is customarily held... under the tightest security in China's forbidden city... but was loaned to the county museum... in a rare cultural exchange
Last year.
-He stole it.
-Cornell.
He was obsessed with it.
You know, he has every valuable coin in the world.
He had to have this one, too.
That's why you went to the FBI.
I took it from him.
It is named the Coin of Royal Power... due to the symbols of royalty-- the lion and the bull.
Its estimated value is seven million dollars.
I was angry, I wanted to hurt him, so I took it.
He came after me, so I went to the FBI.
I promised to testify about Cornell’s business... if they protected me.
And now the blackmailers want the coin?
-Give it to them.
-I don't have it.
-Who does?
-You do.
This whole thing is about a $7-miIIion coin... that Cornell stole from this museum... and you stole from Cornell?
The morning before the explosion...
I gave you something to hide, remember?
I didn't tell you what it was.
I couldn’t.
I just asked you to hide it... and you said you had the perfect place for it.
Remember?
-Pogue.
-Right.
You said one word--''baby.''
-Baby.
-Uh-huh.
You wouldn’t tell me what it meant.
This way.
No. Left.
-That's who's following you?
-That's him.
His name is Hendrix. He's FBI.
Be careful. I need you.
This isn't the way out?
I told Novak I'd kill her if she went to the police.
I'm not the police.
That's why
I'm going to kill you instead.
Who did that?
He made it after all.
Welcome. Welcome.
December 18, 1988-- a date Like any other... or was it?
This is the path we took.
It was a good path, a red path, a path of many moods.
Thank you.
We... we started here.
Then we went here, here, down here... over here, here, and ended up here.
Many people thought we wouldn’t make it.
This was one of the people who laughed at us.
We called him...Steve.
Later he died of dysentery.
We buried him here.
This, I think, is self-explanatory.
These dates are important to remember, obviously.
They reflect a different time and-- a different place.
Exotic? Yes...and no.
Who's to say who's the savage?
Not me. Not you.
There's an old joke that goes, why don't blind people...
But I--I think it was my illustrious colleague...
Dr. Howard from the University of Geneva... who said it best.
I think I should let the doctor tell it himself... shouldn’t I?
Doctor.
Come on up, doctor.
Come on up.
Where you going, doctor?
Don't be shy.
Oh, yes. The doctor's going to lead us... on a walking tour of the neolithic exhibits.
Please, everybody.
Don't Let the doctor get away.
He's on a tight schedule.
-Doctor!
-Doctor!
OK, things have gotten a bit more complicated.
Now, Sarah gave you something to hide.
You hid it either with someone called ''Baby''... or in a place that has something to do with babies.
It's a coin about the size of a penny.
It's worth seven million dollars.
Maybe ''Baby'' is something to do with your past... maybe when you were a cop.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it's something more recent... something just before your amnesia.
''Testimony.''
I'II check that out Later.
You were a private eye.
Maybe that's a clue.
''Two-way radio and survellance glasses.''
Someone's wiling to kill Sarah to get at the coin.
She needs your protection.
She needs your help.
Maybe it's time to do a little legwork.
''Baby.''
Oh, damn. Oh, damn it.
Where--where are the bullets?
Oh, so it was you.
-Guess who.
-Judy.
Surprise.
-What are you doing here?
-11:30 on the dot.
Ready?
I...
For what?
I hope you don't mind.
I borrowed a shirt.
Th-this is not a good idea,
Judy.
Oh. That's not what you said Last night.
Don't I Look as good tonight?
That's not the point.
Well, what is the point?
Hey, I--I think the point is--
-Say it. Say it, Pogue.
-What?
-What?
-Like Last night.
Like Last night. Right.
Let's pretend there was no Last night.
Oh, you animal.
Baby! Baby!
What did you say?
Skip it.
What?
You know what to do.
Then do it.
What are you doing?
Judy, wait a second.
Next time, try not to confuse me with your other girlfriends.
Pogue, do you ever Listen to your messages?
It's Paula.
I'II be home tonight.
I have the baby.
Let's talk this out, OK?
Hey, stranger. You drop off the face of the earth or what?
Give me a call.
Hi, Pogue. It's me.
Call me sometime.
I'm at the new number.
Pogue, it's curia you call me today.
I'm at the office.
Pogue, do you ever Listen to your messages?
It's Paula.
I'II be home tonight.
I have the baby.
Let's talk this out, OK?
OK, your name is M.L. Pogue, and you got a problem-- whenever you go to sleep, you Lose your memory.
Shit.
Whatever you do, don't talk to anyone.
Just stay in bed.
Pogue? It's me, Sarah.
Did you get rid of him
Last night?
Was there any problem?
Could you hold on one second?
You've become involved with a Sarah Novak.
Afraid that Philip Cornell intended to kill her... for what she knew about his operation...
Sarah hired you to protect her.
Sarah, are you safe?
Does Cornell know where you are?
Pogue, Cornell thinks I'm dead.
Oh...right.
One second.
But Sarah made a deal with the FBI... and they made it Look Like she was dead... after a failed bomb attack... so she could testify against Cornell.
But now an FBI man named
Hendrix is blackmailing her... threatening to tell Cornell she's still alive... unless she gives him a valuable coin... that Cornell stole from the Natural History Museum... and Sarah stole from him and gave to you to hide.
But you hid it with either someone called ''Baby''... or a place that has something to do with babies.
-Sarah, can I get back to you?
-Pogue, are you all right?
I'm fine. I'II get back to you.
I'II meet you on the beach at 6:00.
-I want my money, Mr. Pogue.
-Who is this?
Your landIord. Don't tell me you've forgotten again.
-How much is it?
-Eight hundred.
AII right.
I'm sending you a check.
No.
I'm coming over this second.
Good, good.
My apologies for the early hour, Mr. Pogue.
Have you decided to cooperate?
Here it is.
Thank you.
Sorry about the lateness.
Don't be sorry, Mr. Pogue.
The important thing is you signed it.
Yeah, I signed it.
I'm in your debt, Mr. Pogue.
Remember, anything you need, just Let me know.
Um, this door, it seems to stick a bit.
It probably needs a Little oil on the hinge.
So, just so I'II know, it's the first of the month?
No. It's the 8th.
Oh.
So it's always the 8th?
Today is the 8th.
Tomorrow is the 9th.
OK. Good. Good.
AII right. Bye.
What's up?
Sorry about that, boy.
Here's fresh air.
I'II be right back.
May I help you?
Oh, Maurice. Oh, go on in.
What room number is it again?
Naughty.
You've been away too Long.
Number thirty-two.
Up the stairs, at the end.
Thank you.
Problem?
Whose room is that?
Mrs. Pogue's?
Right.
Mom?
Son?
Mom.
Oh, I made some brownies.
Thank you.
They Look delicious.
Mom?
Son?
Don't just stand there.
Come and kiss your mother.
Seven pounds, nine ounces.
-Hmm. That's me?
-Mm-hmm.
The nurse said you were... the prettiest thing she ever saw.
Oh, Look, there's your first Christmas.
Oh, and that pretty tree.
That was our prettiest.
-You remember that house?
-Mom?
Mom, when I was a Little baby, was there someplace I'd go?
In your diapers.
No. Some kind of hiding place.
Even as a baby, you had the straightest teeth.
Oh, there you are.
Mom, where's the rest of this picture?
''Maurice, Paula, and Baby.''
Where's the rest?
Nap time, Shirley.
Now, don't worry about it.
-Come on.
-Mom.
Visiting hours are over.
I promised I would never say anything bad about her.
About who, Paula?
Come on.
What are you doing here, Pogue?
Nostalgic for the old academy?
Good to see you, John. How's the district attorney's office?
Fine. Rosenheim wanted to get in a Little target practice.
Oh, you mean my good friend
Donald the assistant D.A.
That's right.
I'm looking for Paula, John.
Do you know where I might find her?
Sure you want to see her?
It's none of my business, but watch out for Willis.
He's never forgiven you, slugger.
Paula’s on lane eight.
Slugger?
You been seeing any more of Sarah?
Sarah Novak? No.
-Good.
-But she's coming by tonight.
Pogue, sit down.
You need to get some help.
I wish I could.
You can't fight this on your own.
Sarah's afraid of bringing anyone else in.
Pogue, Listen to me.
Sarah is gone.
-Just till tonight.
-No! She's not coming back.
-How do you know?
-It's a fact of Life.
Good, John. Thanks a Lot.
Not now, Pogue.
-You two going to fight?
-Shut up, Donald.
Just great to see you back together.
We're not together.
I was just visiting Shirley.
Yeah? She still mad at me?
N-no. She said to say hi.
I'm trying to shoot here, Pogue.
It sounds Like fighting.
I do hear fighting.
You two should have never got married.
Ya-ya.
He Looks just Like his daddy.
-You think?
-Oh, yeah. Spitting image.
What do you think, Maurice?
I always thought he looked more
Like me, but, yeah, I see it.
-Thirty seconds.
-Thirty seconds.
Can you watch him for a second?
Maurice, just take him for a walk or something.
Sarah gave you the coin to hide... and you hid it either with someone called ''Baby''... or in a place that has something to do with babies.
Can I have teddy?
Teddy? Yeah.
Do the happy face.
Get away from him!
Don't push your luck, Pogue.
It was a sucker punch.
-Willis.
-You stay away from him.
-It's not what you think, OK?
-Yeah, right.
Just walk away! Just walk away!
-Knock it off.
-Would you leave him alone?
Let go of the damn thing!
I don't want you near my wife... and I sure as hell don't want you near my son.
I'II kill you if I see you near them again.
Pogue, I got a clue about who's sleeping with my fiancée.
She comes home Last night wearing this.
It's a man's, not mine.
And check out these initials--
M.P.
Someone with the initials M.P.
What do you think?
Maybe it's somebody called M.P.
Uh, not--not necessarily.
I just came by to check the roll call, you know?
Let's see. There's, uh,
Mike and Manuel...
-Maurice!
-Mattie, Mickey...
-Maurice!
-One second!
How about Last names?
Last names.
-Maurice Pogue!
-I'm coming!
Well, your car payments haven't been.
I'm not a suspicious type by nature. You know that.
It's just the idea of Judith sleeping with someone else--
I could kill, you understand?
-Well, I'II check into it.
-Will you?
You're a buddy. Thanks.
Listen, the suspenders Look great... but I'd Lose the teddy bear.
What do you think?
-Looks great.
-Yeah? Aw, thanks.
So, what's it going to be?
Very you.
Thanks...
I think.
You Look happy.
You had a good day?
Have we ever...
I mean, we...
Did, uh...
How serious are we?
I guess that depends.
I get serious very quickly.
I think you do, too.
I do?
Don't you?
I mean, but... wh-what do you really know about me?
I know enough.
There's something else.
I hit a snag with the coin.
-I don't want to talk about it.
-It's not as simple as...
Kiss me.
There was an explosion, and my memory...
''Kiss me''?
What is with this ''Kiss me''?
Ouch.
What is this? What is this?
Oh, that's where those were.
Thank you.
Like it's the first time.
Just one second.
-What?
-It's all right.
Wait.
Right back.
When you hear this, it'll be Wednesday morning.
The woman sleeping next to you, her name is Sarah Novak.
Don't be silly. I want you.
I got to go.
Where are you--
Don't Let her down because...
What are you--
Shit.
Because I think you're in Love with her.
Come here.
My watch is in your hair.
I'm sorry.
-My bra.
-Oh, your bra, yes.
I'm real good at this.
Man.
The woman sleeping next to you... her name is Sarah Novak.
Don't Let her down because
I think you're in Love with her.
Of course it's a good sign.
I go to sleep, I wake up...
I remember everything from the day before.
I'm not saying it's a bad sign, Pogue... but we can't tell anything from that. Cough.
Why not?
You still can't remember anything... from the day before yesterday or the day before that, right?
What I'm saying is, you need a breakthrough... a memory of something before your amnesia.
-What's that?
-What's what?
Scrambled or poached?
-Scrambled.
-Scrambled.
-Scrambled?
-What's scrambled?
-The eggs.
-The eggs.
Well, whoever she is, Pogue, she's exactly what you need-- someone to help you get on with your Life.
Got to go.
''Baby.''
Baby Ruth. Baby Ruth.
Baby powder.
Baby grand.
Baby face.
Baby blue.
Crybaby.
Sugar baby.
Baby.
Fido. Here, Fido.
Here, Spot. Here, Spot. Spot.
Rusty!
Pete? Here, Pete.
Hi, boy. Hi, Baby. Hi. Yeah.
Have you got something?
It's incredible.
It's incredible.
You're incredible.
Oh, no. Well, all right.
A Little bit.
-Yes. Look at it.
-Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.
So, what time's he supposed to call?
I may have to meet him alone.
-AII right.
-Ouch.
-What are you doing?
-What is this?
What are you doing down there?
What is this?
That's a two-way surveillance glasses and radio.
Wear them when he phones.
-Over there.
-AII right.
Santa Monica Pier in half an hour.
No one else. Just me.
He says if he sees you within a mile, he won't show.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You’ll need the coin.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Stay, boy.
You're Late.
How Long does it take to drive a block, you idiot?
I don't want to hear it.
-Did you get it from him?
-No problem.
Well, where is it?
-I've got it.
-Well, let's see it.
Not here. The big guy's gonna want to see it. Come on.
The big guy can wait.
What about Pogue?
He didn't catch on?
-Do not underestimate him.
-You should talk.
Any more questions, or can we go now?
Let's go.
Hold on, boy!
May I help you, sir?
Yes, you may. You may.
The gentleman on court six.
I believe he's a friend of mine, but I'm not quite certain.
Well, I'II call down.
Oh, I want to surprise him.
Certainly.
Court six.
That's Doover.
Dr. Anthony Doover.
Is he your friend, sir?
Dr. Doover?
My mistake.
Give me a high five.
Well, smile, Beth.
You pulled it off.
-She's got a guilty conscience.
-Shut up.
What, about Pogue?
Looks to me
Like you've been doing... a few Little favors for him on your own.
Stop it.
You're a character, Beth.
Well, let's see it.
Let me see the coin.
Come on.
What?
OK, this is Pogue's doing.
He saw through our Little charade.
So you go back, you get the tape before he wakes up... and we'll begin again from the beginning.
I beg your pardon?
It's over.
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm not.
May I remind you this Little item is worth $7 million?
Seven million.
Are you telling me you're going to turn your back on that?
I don't think so.
Watch me.
Does it Look Like it now?
Like what?
Pogue, you want the joke of the day?
How do you find a blind man in a nudist colony?
How?
It ain't hard.
You ain't much in a laughing mood today, Pogue.
Neither were your friends.
What friends?
The guys in your apartment.
Hey, where you been all day?
Uh, out.
Yeah, well, I been calling.
Somebody kept hanging up.
Come here.
I've got another clue.
Nobody at the LAPD has the initials M.P.
Are you sure?
Check this out.
I caught Judy tearing up a letter, OK?
I got this out just before she flushed it down the toilet.
Check it out.
Look at the numbers--
What's that other number?
5? Maybe a 3?
Could it be a license plate, maybe a phone number?
Uh, probably a phone number.
Maybe an address?
Oh, I-I'II Look into it.
OK. Well, we've got to go over your Cornell testimony.
How about tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night. That's good.
The testimony's tomorrow at 2:00, so you know...
That makes sense.
That wouldn’t be--
You're...
-Excuse me.
-You're coming through.
There you are.
You all right? There you go.
Pogue, the testimony.
Tomorrow morning at 9:00.
Judge BIock's upset because we missed the Last court date.
He said if you're not on the stand tomorrow... he's throwing out the whole case.
I'II be there.
What do you think of the tie now?
Have you thought about a clip-on or--
That's enough.
Oh, you're in trouble now.
Where's the coin, Maurice?
See that?
You got to watch out... when he starts calling you by your first name.
I wouldn’t do that if I were you.
There's some guys in there with guns.
-Open it.
-I really wouldn’t advise it.
My landlord?
Sir?
Seen a pickup truck speeding by here?
Just out for a walk?
Oh, I hate to iron.
When do they empty the meters?
Tomorrow. Why?
I--I just saw some kids messin' around with them.
-W-what time?
Don't worry, sir.
We’ll be here all night.
Great.
-He paid me to scare Pogue.
-Shut up.
To shoot up his apartment, make him turn over the coin.
What coin?
Royal...something.
It's supposed to be worth a Lot.
How do you know Mr. Pogue has this coin?
Well, when they brought Pogue into the hospital... he was babbling on about the coin being with Baby.
Will you shut up?
Baby? What's baby mean?
I don't know.
Anything else you can tell us?
No, except I think
I deserve something.
I mean, for my trouble.
Oh, yes, you most certainly do.
Not on the rug.
Pogue, I'm sorry.
I'm not Sarah Novak.
I'm really Beth Holly... a washed-up actress trying to become a model.
I Looked Like Sarah.
That's why Doover hired me.
OK, it's Thursday morning.
Your name is M.L. Pogue.
You're a private investigator.
When you're slapped, you’ll take it and Like it.
You're a, uh, you're a tough guy... a dangerous customer.
Women, they flock to you.
You use them and drop them
Like yesterday's laundry.
Or they use you.
OK, your name is M.L. Pogue, and you got a problem.
Whenever you go to sleep, you Lose your memory.
''Half a league, half a League, half a League onward...
''all in the valley of death rode the six hundred.
''Forward the light brigade.
Charge for the guns, he said.
''Into the valley of death rode the six hundred!''
''Aardvark--an animal resembling the anteater...
''found in parts of Africa...''
Whenever you go to sleep, you Lose your memory.
You can't go to sleep, or you’ll Lose your memory.
''Push this button.''
Good morning, Mr. Pogue.
Good morning.
I'm disappointed with you.
Eight hundred dollars for a bribe?
I thought I meant more to you than that.
Now I hear you've been holding out on me.
The Coin of Royal Power-- we know you have it.
Are you sure you've got the right person here or...
Where we going?
What happened to your thumb?
Nothin'.
Anything?
He's good.
If you don't tell me where that coin is...
I will have to kill you.
But first I will kill her.
I have a court date to keep.
You have two hours... to sweat it out, as it were.
Oh, Pogue, I'm so sorry.
I was wrong.
When Doover came to me,
I had no money, nothing.
But I didn't mean to get you into this.
Can you forgive me?
Sure.
Who are you?
AII rise and face the flag.
What is going on,
Mr. Rosenheim?
We've hit a snag, your honor.
Our witness is missing.
AII right.
Both of you, up here.
OK, Let me get this straight.
I'm a detective with amnesia... caused by an explosion set by Cornell... the guy I'm supposed to be testifying against... in a court of law on a murder charge.
You are an actress who pretended to be... a victim killed in the explosion... in order to get a valuable coin... that she gave to me before my amnesia... and I hid in my dog's collar.
But now you say you're sorry... and you want to help me get to court and find the coin.
If we could just have another day... to locate our witness, sir, I'm sure--
You've got until 3:00,
Mr. Rosenheim.
Listen, you're a detective.
You've been in tough spots
Like this before.
I can't remember.
Listen, that doesn't matter.
You are who you are.
Think. Give me that.
-Careful. Careful.
-That's cold.
Here, take this.
You get the guy in here... and then I'II--Poof!
Bam, bam, bam.
You just sit right back down there and get comfortable.
That's right.
-Now what?
-I have no idea.
-Pogue.
-What?
You're a baseball pitcher.
You are. I'm telling you.
That's about the distance to home plate.
Hit him with a pitch.
I thought you said
I was a detective.
You were in a baseball League at night.
-How Long ago?
-A few years--Last year.
I think you pitched three no-hitters... struck out twenty-five batters.
-Left hand or right hand?
-Right.
-You think I'm making this up?
-How many batters?
Twenty...ten in one game.
You said twenty-five a second ago. I heard you.
What is this, a sports quiz?
You're a champion. Let's go.
AII right, I'II do it one time.
-Let's go.
-One time.
Right now.
Just take it and do it.
Now. Now.
-What are you doing?
-I got to be a pitcher.
Now, now, now.
Loose. OK.
See? I suck.
I'm horrible.
Listen, you always lean high on your first pitch.
-I can't.
-Just do another one for me.
One more.
OK, for you, I'II do it one more time, and that's it.
You're a champion.
Now.
Just do it now.
Did you see that?
You did it.
You forgive me, don't you, Pogue?
That's kind of hard for me to answer...
-Beth.
-Beth.
I don't know anything about you.
You know enough.
Come on.
First pitch.
That was the first pitch.
Now, where am I going?
Make a right to the courthouse.
We're going to smarten you up.
Here. Wear these.
-Those are nice.
-Thanks.
Pogue, you have to memorize your testimony.
The only way to keep Cornell off our backs... is to put him in jail.
What testimony? What do I say?
Here. Listen to this.
-Comb.
-''Testimony.''
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work.
-It works.
-Try it.
Give it to me.
Damn it! It's batteries.
The batteries.
Do you have batteries?
Uh, glove compartment?
No, no, no.
Batteries. Batteries.
-The glasses. Put those on.
-I don't need glasses.
Don't worry.
Listen, just Listen.
I can see fine.
That's you. I hear you.
That's it.
God damn it, Pogue!
Where the hell have you been?
Keep the glasses on.
I'II go and get batteries.
Listen, Pogue, just stay calm, all right?
I don't want you to be too detailed in your descriptions.
I'd rather Let the jury's imagination run wild... than have them question specifics.
The glasses are a nice touch, by the way.
They make you Look very, very respectable.
Thank you.
I got another clue about the LAPD T-shirt... the one with ''M.P.'' on the collar?
They haven't made that shirt for two years.
Let us through, please.
You have to Let us through.
Do your job there, will you, fellas?
Oh, kiss me!
No time for family reunions.
I'm sorry.
I still don't have a check.
Did you talk to Sarah Novak today?
No. She's dead.
So happy you could join us,
Mr. Pogue.
I'm happy, too.
-Excuse me. I need to buy--
-Just a sec.
Nice lady's buying a postcard.
-OK, but--
-Patience.
Stand, sir.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
State your name and spell it for the record, please.
Maurice Pogue.
P...o...g...
-U-e!
-U-e!
Mr. Pogue, I'd Like to begin... with a few simple background questions.
You're a private investigator, is that correct?
And where is your place of business?
For the record.
-Stall!
-Stall!
Excuse me?
No. You stall.
I mean...stall.
S'tall possible to turn up the air conditioning here?
Answer the question, Mr. Pogue.
My address.
You want my address.
P-o, P-o, P-o.
Before I give my address...
I'd Like to state one thing for the record.
That's a fabulous pin.
Oh, thank you. It was a gift.
Really?
Have you seen this, judge?
Objection, your honor!
Nonresponsive.
He's such a well-mannered boy.
Pogue! 1195 Speedway!
-Mr. Pogue.
-1195 Speedway.
-Beautiful postcard.
-Can I have some batteries?
Just one moment.
And your change.
Batteries!
Mr. Pogue, is it also true that you used to work... as a police officer?
-What size?
-''C.''
Amigo.
And that you retired from the police force two years ago?
AII right, Mr. Pogue,
I have a few more questions... before we move on.
Mr. Rosenheim, do you have a question?
Yes, your honor,
I do have a few more questions.
Back stock.
It's in front of you, in front of you. No, no, no!
Mr. Pogue... you're a bachelor, isn't that correct?
Do you Live alone?
Would you say that you Live a promiscuous lifestyIe?
Objection, your honor.
What's the relevance?
For background, your honor.
Rather pertinent background.
Well, I'II allow a Little leeway.
Thank you, your honor.
Again, Mr. Pogue.
Would you say you Live a promiscuous lifestyle?
I--I wouldn’t say promiscuous.
Let me rephrase.
You are attracted to women, aren't you?
And not being married hasn't kept you... from being sexually active?
A simple yes or no will do,
Mr. Pogue.
-No.
-Thank you.
Mr. Pogue, what is the seventh commandment?
The seventh commandment?
Yes, yes, that one in particular.
The right to bear arms?
A Little difficulty with that one, Mr. Pogue?
Like some help with this, hmm?
Shall I help you out with the seventh commandment?
Thou shall not commit adultery!
Your honor! Your honor!
Your honor!
AII right.
Withdrawn. Withdrawn.
Mr. Pogue, where were you on the night of April 7th?
I don't remember.
Come, come, Mr. Pogue.
It was three nights ago.
Would you have this court believe you don't remember... who you were with three nights ago?
Yes. Let me refresh your memory a Little bit.
I have evidence here that suggests you were with a woman!
Background is fine,
Mr. Rosenheim... but let's get back to the crime, please.
Mr. Pogue, you've testified... that the defendant was responsible... for the death of Sarah Novak, is that correct?
I got it! Your testimony.
I'm sorry, Pogue,
I'm not Sarah Novak.
Oh, my God.
Pogue, I taped over it.
What?
A simple question, Mr. Pogue.
You testified in the past... that Mr. Cornell murdered Sarah Novak.
Is that correct?
Now, to the best of your recollection... and perhaps drawing upon your extensive expertise... in this particular area... do you think that Mr. Cornell has ever... boffed his best friend's fiancée?
Objection!
That's enough, Mr. Rosenheim.
Where is this leading?
I'II tell you where it's leading, your honor.
-To his fucking grave!
-Objection, your honor!
Tell the court you were with her!
-You're in contempt!
-You were with that slut!
You want to talk about sluts?
-Let's talk about Cynthia!
-Leave her out of this!
You slut!
As far as I'm concerned, we're even!
Even? He did boff her!
We need help in courtroom five.
Damn it! What's going on here?
I'm sorry, Pogue.
I'm not Sarah Novak.
I should’ve told you sooner... but I started to Like being Sarah... and I started to Like being with you.
I've lied to you throughout,
Pogue, I know... but there is one thing that's not a Lie.
I Love you. I Love you.
I'm not Sarah, but I Love you.
Rosenheim, what are you doing?
I can't reach his throat.
Order in my courtroom!
I gotcha!
Order in the court!
I'II have order in the courtroom!
Leave him alone!
Leave my baby alone!
That's it! That's it!
That's enough!
Come on, back off.
Back off. Back off.
You touch her again,
I'II kill you!
You son of a bitch!
Not me, her!
The coin, it's in the alley behind my apartment.
The Last parking meter.
Your memory's back!
I'm on my way.
I'II kill him!
Give me two seconds!
Get your hands off of me!
What are you doing?
I'm the bailiff, damn it!
I'II have your badges for this.
Move it on out.
Mr. Pogue, what do you remember... of the night of February 8th, the death of Sarah Novak... its aftermath, and the person responsible?
I remember... everything.
Miss, there are some kids breaking into a parking meter.
-What? Not on my beat!
-Around the corner.
Thank you!
Why did you change your plea,
Mr. Cornell?
The fact that we made a deal has no bearing... on Mr. Cornell’s guilt or innocence.
But it's kind of a thumbs-down for his credibility, isn't it?
Thumbs-down? Thumbs-down?
What do you mean, thumbs-down?
We will ask that Mr. Cornell receive the maximum sentence--
Life imprisonment.
I want to add one more thing.
This successful prosecution could not have happened... without the assistance of one very special person.
Oh, thank you.
Even as a baby, I always knew... that Maurice was a very special person.
Hey, boy.
Good to see you.
Here we go.
Remember me?
Humphrey Bogart?
I can give you a hint.
Mmm, it's coming back.
You know what?
It's almost there.
I'm cured.
How much do you remember, anyway?
Well, let's see.
How about, uh...
Viva suo massimo momento...
No. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Yeah, but what did you do with the coin?
WOMAN ON TV: Here Friday morning.
MAN ON TV:
Now, let's get the stocks here in London.
The Financial Times 100 Index up 11 points,
just above the key 3,800 level.
In the rest of Europe, Frankfurt's DAX
gaining nine points to 2,532.
In Paris, the CAC 40 losing seven,
the weaker franc weighing on the market.
Thank you, Ilsa.
Have a nice day.
MAN ON RADIO:
... they are on time this morning.
San Francisco's freeways are...
Morning, sir.
JACK ON SPEAKERPHONE: Tell me
what we're supposed to do.
You may be perched on majority shares,
but we all get fucked if the actuals crash.
That old man is gonna sink us.
As soon as I have Baer/Grant's
P&L report in hand, I will call you.
- Is that a promise?
- I'm sorry, I'm not aware of that term.
Well, what do I do if Anson calls
about substantiation procedure?
Have your secretary say you're in a meeting.
Thank you, Jack.
- Yes, Maria?
- Invitations.
- The Museum Gala.
- No.
- Fitzwilliam Botanical Annual Fundraiser.
- No.
- The Hinchberger wedding.
- Hinchberger wedding?
Tuxedos, droning conversations,
I don't think so, no.
I'll send your regrets.
Honestly, why must I bother?
If you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
- Yes?
- I have an Elizabeth on line three.
- MARIA: Your ex-wife.
- I know who it is.
Take a message.
Oh, happy birthday, sir.
Thank you, Maggie.
I don't like her.
I wouldn't mention the following, but he was very insistent.
- It's a prank.
- What?
A gentleman called requesting lunch.
I assured him you were busy...
- What's his name?
- A Mr. Seymour Butts.
Uhder The Bleachers by Seymour Butts.
I'm sorry?
Cancel my lunch. Make a reservation at the City Club for myself and Mr. Butts.
My usual table.
Maria, put the reservation under my name.
- Are you ready to order, sir?
- No, I'm still waiting.
This was iced tea.
- Conrad, what a surprise.
- Happy birthday, Nickie.
"Seymour Butts".
I'll never get tired of that one.
That's why it's a classic.
Nice restaurant. They gave me a free jacket.
I'm sure they'll want it back.
- I remember being here.
- I took you here once.
No, I used to buy crystal meth off the maître d'.
- Really?
- In college.
- Which college?
- Touchè.
Miss me?
As much as that's possible. You look good.
- So do you. To think I was worried.
- Worried about me?
How long's it been since Mom's funeral?
Two, three years.
- I thought you quit.
- I did, it didn't take.
- You can't smoke here.
- I'm with you.
It's illegal to smoke in restaurants in California.
Fuck California.
- How are you?
- Couldn't be better.
- Elizabeth?
- We're divorced.
She remarried a pediatrician, or a gynecologist, or a pediatric gynecologist.
Lives in Sausalito.
That's too bad. I liked her.
- And what about you?
- You don't keep track of me anymore?
Not since family week at rehab.
So what brings you to town, Conrad?
Everything all right?
- Yeah.
- Need anything?
- No.
- Really?
No, I don't need anything from you.
I just found myself laying naked on a beach near lbiza and all of a sudden it clicked,
October 12th, Nickie's birthday.
- October 11 th.
- Whatever.
- This is for you.
- You shouldn't have.
What do you get for the man who has everything?
Consumer Recreation Services.
Well, I do have golf clubs.
Call that number.
- Why?
- It'll make your life fun.
- Fun.
- You know what that is?
You've seen other people have it.
It's an entertainment service.
An escort service?
A profound life experience.
- WAITRESS: Sorry. I'll just get...
- Nah, it's all right, just...
- Tell me you'll call.
- I said I would.
No, you didn't.
You still on medication?
- Why would you say that?
- WAITRESS: You gentlemen ready to order?
- I didn't mean how it sounded.
- I'm not on anything.
I'm not even seeing a shrink.
And I feel great.
Do you mind?
I think you'll like this. I did.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
- I'll call them.
- Do it. For you.
I said I'll call, okay? All right, I'll call.
It's just that... I hate surprises.
I know.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, Mr. Van Orton
Happy birthday to you
MAN 1 ON SPEAKER: Someone's gotta
drive a stake through Anson's heart.
MAN 2: Have you seen
the profitability report?
NICHOLAS: Lmagine how unhappy I am.
- MAN 1: You'll deal with Anson?
- Correct.
We're furious.
- Sleep well, Nicholas.
- I will.
Good night, Ilsa.
- Dinner's in the oven.
- Thank you. Oh, I saw Conrad today.
- Did you? How is he?
- He's okay.
I think he's in a personal improvement cult.
Well, send my love if you see him again.
- Happy birthday.
- Good night.
... companies that defaulted
on their payments.
The FCC expects to receive
more than $500 million in bids...
- Elizabeth, good evening.
- Happy birthday, Nickie.
- Have you had a nice birthday?
- Does Rose Kennedy have a black dress?
I went not once, but twice, through the spanking machine.
I can only imagine.
- How are you?
- Connie asked me the same thing today.
Connie? Really? I always liked your brother.
Anyway...
I just thought this might be difficult for you.
Just another birthday.
Because of your father.
That's right, he was 48, wasn't he?
I hadn't thought about it until now.
(ELIZABETH SIGHING)
Why do I call?
I honestly don't know.
Please send Dr. Mel and Rachel my best.
She has a little brother on the way.
We did the ultrasound.
Official nuclear family.
You must be very pleased.
We are. We are very pleased.
Well, it's good to talk with you...
I guess I should let you go.
- Take care of yourself.
- You too, Nicholas. I mean that, I really do.
Be well. Bye.
A proposal to encourage small businesses
to provide their employees
with health insurance
is now being debated
by Washington legislators.
The bill, which attaches small-business
health plans to those of larger corporations
is receiving initial support
from a number of key Republican leaders.
However, Democratic lawmakers
are voicing serious concerns about the bill,
claiming that it would undermine local...
I just wanted to make sure that we understand each other.
Once you get it down on paper, then you can count on my full support.
- We understand.
- Thank you.
We'll talk soon.
You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you.
MAN ON PHONE: I do feel this reflects...
- I received this...
- Just a moment.
- I took these tests in good faith.
- RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry you feel that way.
We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience.
Thank you for choosing CRS.
Mr. Feingold, could you assist this gentleman?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Jim Feingold, VP Engineering,
Data Analysis.
I don't know exactly how this works.
My brother sent me this card as a gift.
All right, excellent. Let's get started.
I'm sorry about all this hullabaloo here.
We're... Well, we're still moving.
I got an office around here somewhere.
Do you mind holding that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Are you hungry? New Moon Cafè.
- No, thank you.
Best in Chinatown.
A gift from Conrad Van Orton.
- Interesting.
- What is?
Your brother was a client with our London branch.
We do a sort of informal scoring.
His numbers are outstanding.
Really?
- You sure you're not hungry?
- No.
Now, you need to fill out these forms.
There's an application and a couple of psych tests.
The MMPI and the TAT.
For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.
We'll run a TRW.
"I sometimes hurt small animals.
True or false?"
"I feel guilty when I masturbate."
Well, I don't write the questions.
I just review the answers.
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)
- What is this for?
- A sense of your capabilities...
No, what is this for? What are you selling?
Oh...
- It's a game.
- A game?
Specifically tailored for each participant.
Think of it as a great vacation.
Except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
What kind of vacation?
- It's different every time.
- Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
- What if nothing is lacking?
- May I make two suggestions?
You think I'll participate without knowing...
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.
Second, you don't have to decide today.
Take the silly test, fill out the forms.
One day, your game begins.
You either love it or hate it.
Decide then.
You know, we're like an experiential Book-of-the-Month Club.
You can drop out at any time with no further obligation.
That was my sales pitch.
- How long will this take?
- An hour for those, an hour for the physical.
- Physical?
- It's a cursory examination.
Turn your head and cough.
You'll be out of here in no time.
Confused.
Risky.
Bloody.
Whoops.
MARIA: Mr. Sutherland called.
NICHOLAS: Make it Wednesday.
Anson Baer called about tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
- How much longer will this take?
- Not long, you're almost done.
You said that two hours ago.
Put it back until tomorrow.

You have 0.9 seconds

Does this thing end?
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- Don't worry.
It's been terrific spending my entire day with your crack team.
It's all down to this, an insurance company requirement.
It states you're aware that The Game exists, that you're willing to participate in it.
Payment is at your brother's discretion, dependent on your satisfaction.
If I'm not happy, he doesn't have to pay?
We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
I think you mean "dissatisfied."
That's right.
You're a left-brain word fetishist.
Initials. And sign there. In blood.
Just kidding.
All right, your copy will be at the front desk in this folder.
And keep the pen. We'll let you know.
CONRAD: Monday or Tuesday?
NICHOLAS: Both bad.
- How about tonight?
- I'm working all this evening.
NICHOLAS:
Wednesday's the only possibility right now.
- NICHOLAS: You wanna do dinner?
- Okay.
NICHOLAS: By the way, I went to CRS.
CONRAD: Really? What'd you think?
NICHOLAS: Well, they seemed
just a little bit disorganized.
CONRAD: When I did it in London,
they'd been around a while.
- Are you gonna do this?
- I haven't decided yet.
MAN 1: It's like getting in on the ground floor of the next Disneyland.
MAN 2: CRS won't go public.
They're family-owned.
MAN 1: Stranger things have happened.
MAN 2: No, they haven't, actually.
MAN 1: They opened here.
MAN 2: The Game in San Francisco?
See? They're doing fine without any of us.
MAN: A scotch and soda.
- Nicholas, how are you?
- James, good evening.
- Got new members here?
- I believe so, sir.
- Put their next round on me.
- Gotcha, sir.
No, no, no. Last time I played Pebble,
I swore I'd never pick up a club again.
Well, speaking about games,
I couldn't help but overhear you talking about CRS.
The reason I mention it is I took the test today.
- The Montgomery street office.
- You did? Kudos.
- So yours hasn't started yet?
- Not yet.
That was one of the questions I had for you.
What is it?
- What is it?
- The eternal question.
You know, I envy you.
I wish I could go back and do it for the first time, all over again.
Here's to new experiences.
Excuse me, I've gotta go. Night, Ted.
- Nicholas.
- Nice to meet you.
- So you played recently?
- About a year ago.
I was working in Los Angeles.
I hear the London office is very good, too.
Sounds like a lot of fantasy role-playing nonsense.
You wanna know what it is?
What it's all about?
John, chapter 9, verse 25.
I haven't been to Sunday school in a long time.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."
Good night, Nicholas. Best of luck.
Good night.
NICHOLAS: If the Baer/Grant meeting is not held tomorrow, it may as well not be held at all.
When Mr. Van Orton boards his plane on the morrow, he will have every agreement and addendum, the complete closing package, flawlessly revised.
So you'll miss another opera you would have slept during anyway.
We now have an opportunity to show our client how well we will rise to his exhilarating challenge.
- Yes.
- CYNTHIA: Nicholas Van Orton?
- Who is this?
- This is Cynthia from CRS.
- How did you get this number?
- We've processed your application.
- I'm in a meeting...
- I'm afraid it was rejected.
I beg your pardon?
You shouldn't feel
this reflects negatively on you.
- This is ridiculous.
- Thank you for thinking of CRS.
- Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.
FEMAL VOICE: You may hang up,
or press "pound" for more options.
Oh, this is Conrad, leave a message.
Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas.
Give me a ring when you get in.
Oh, regarding your birthday present, things are a little crazy right now,
I don't know if I can fit it in my schedule.
We'll talk about it at dinner tomorrow.
Thanks. Bye.
Hello?
... resulting rise of unemployment
and decline in viable small businesses.
Meanwhile, Republican leaders argue
that its passage would be
the very stimulant
a sluggish economy needs.
No one has expressed an opinion
as to how it will impact
the pampered existence
of Nicholas Van Orton.
The one thing on which both
Democrats and Republicans agree
is that most Americans harbor
serious doubts about the economic future.
A recent poll suggests a staggering
57% of American workers believe
there is a very real chance
they will be unemployed
within the next five to seven years.
But what does that matter
to a bloated, millionaire fat cat like you?
Stock markets rose
both domestically and abroad
after the announcement
of stronger than expected earnings
by several hi-tech companies,
but dipped again after reports
that Nicholas Van Orton had sneezed.
Are you gonna spend the rest of the evening
prying at that clown's mouth?
I... I don't...
It's frustrating for me
if you don't pay attention.
What is this?
This is your game, Nicholas,
and welcome to it.
I'm here to let you in on a few ground rules.
You've received the very first key
and others will follow.
You won't know where you'll find them
or how you'll need to use them,
so keep your eyes open.
- How do you... You can see me?
- Let's save the questions till after.
How does this work?
There's a tiny camera
looking at you right now.
- That's impossible.
- You're right. Impossible.
You're having a conversation
with your television.
It's miniaturized.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
Mr. Van Orton?
And in domestic news, in southern...
Yes, Ilsa, what is it?
- Is everything all right?
- Fine...
... in a petroleum processing
plant yesterday...
I've finished for the evening.
Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night, then.
... broke out
in a petroleum processing plant yesterday.
Several workers were injured...
- Who's that?
- Never mind who that is.
You wanna know
how a camera got into your home.
Yes, I would.
Cold.
Colder.
Warm.
Warmer.
Write this number down.
It's a 24-hour
Consumer Recreation Services hotline,
for emergencies only.
But don't call asking
what the object of the game is.
Figuring that out is the object of the game.
Good luck,
and congratulations on choosing CRS.
... threatened to have
the American ambassador expelled.
The US State Department responded quickly
with a formal apology,
and announcement
of the ambassador's immediate removal.
MAN: Help me out here, huh?
I used to be in Nam.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.
May I help you?
What is it?
What?
Thank you.
MAN: Bud?
Can you help me out?
I need some toilet paper, I ran out.
Just go into the next stall.
Come on, help me out.
Hello?
- Didn't expect to see you here.
- I wanted to wish you luck.
- You been up all night?
- I checked it. Personally.
I appreciate that.
Go home and get some sleep.
- You sure you don't want me along?
- No, I'll be fine.
- SAM: Nice shirt.
- Don't ask.
Ciao.
ANSON: All these years, the first time ever you step foot in these offices, it's to ask me to step down.
NICHOLAS: You promised to meet the projections, Anson.
$1.60 a share is what you said.
I don't think this visit comes as a surprise.
- The projections were too optimistic.
- Admittedly, yes.
Our EPS was 150 last quarter.
We are up eight cents per share.
The expectations were ten.
The expectations meant everything.
Will you hold me to it over pennies?
My stock is falling,
I don't know about yours.
Those pennies are costing millions.
Give me next quarter.
If you still feel this way, vote your shares.
Today is what counts, Anson.
You... You intractable son of a bitch.
If your father could see you now.
- What?
- Your father was a friend.
A friend.
God damn it, I watched you grow up.
Because you went fishing with my father,
I should watch you throw my money away?
- I was...
- I'm not finished.
You misspoke before when you said you're stepping down.
I am firing you.
Action is taken, confidence is restored.
- The stock goes up.
- No.
There's no Baer/Grant Publishing...
No Baer/Grant Publishing without Anson Baer.
Where's Stewart Grant?
Probably out sailing, enjoying his golden years, wondering where the hell you are, Anson.
I'm sorry.
You failed.
I have prepared a severance package that is more than equitable.
Valid until this evening.
I could fight you on this.
If I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate.
Benefits shrink, options narrow, and your compensation will be shriveled.
I think it's in your best interest, Anson, to...
Well, I guess this is your lucky day.
My lawyers will be in touch with you.
Excuse me, has Conrad Van Orton left a message?
- I'll check right away, Mr. Van Orton.
- Thank you.
I'm so sorry. Here.
- Please don't do that.
- I'm so sorry. I wasn't even looking.
- I'm really having a bad day.
- How about a bad month?
You did almost the same thing to me last week.
- Here.
- Don't do that.
Just get me some napkins and some soda water.
It looks like the cleaning bill's gonna be more than the suit.
I don't think so.
- It was an accident, sir.
- Terrific.
I said I was sorry.
- Asshole.
- Christine.
- Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer.
- Fine. Then you kiss his ass.
- Don't you talk to me like that.
- I apologized, I offered to help.
- Clean out your locker.
- What?
You heard me.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton.
Will this table suit you for a complimentary meal?
It'll be fine.
- I'll fetch your waiter.
- Thank you.
Check, sir.
Fuck you and your vichyssoise, you little...
Miss? Pardon me, miss.
Great, it's you.
I don't know how this works, but do you have something for me? I...
- I received this note.
- What are you babbling about, psycho?
I need to know what is going on.
I'm going on my second job this month, and now it looks like I'm going on unemployment.
- Maybe I should try to explain...
- Don't explain, just fuck off.
Son of a bitch.
I'm trying to... I am apologizing.
Jesus. What is this?
- What's with him?
- He just fell down.
Sir, can you hear me?
Do you know what to do?
I don't even know if he's breathing.
Move your head. Don't stand there, get help.
Hey, hey. It's okay.
- We're gonna get help.
- How do we know he's real?
There's piss in his pants, is that real enough for you?
- Holy God.
- He's turning blue.
Police.
(MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO)
- You have to fill these forms out.
- I don't know this man.
I can't get involved.
- I have to detain you.
- Detain me?
- The report's gotta be filled out.
- She can do it.
Ride with your wife, we'll meet at the hospital.
Two blocks away.
She's not my wife.
NICHOLAS: This is insane. Ten minutes ago,
I was enjoying a quiet little dinner.
I received this note.
- He's breathing, isn't he?
- Yes.
Is the siren entirely necessary?
Right.
Let's just talk to someone who can get this over with.
Hang on.
They need your driver's license number.
- Oh, no, you've got to be kidding.
- What is happening?
This is what I was trying to explain to you.
This is a game.
- A what?
- It's a company.
They plan elaborate pranks.
I don't really understand it myself.
What are you talking about? This is a...
The lights, they went out.
A hundred people ran away.
Oh, so you mean the guy who just pissed himself and turned blue was...
Sorry about that.
You should be.
Why are they involving you?
There's gotta be a fucking flashlight.
Oh, great.
I thought that guy was gonna die.
I gave him mouth-to-mouth.
I'll see you around.
- How do you know that's the way?
- I don't.
CHRISTINE: Where'd you all go, you motherfucking frat boys?
You'd better hide.
Lobby?
My brother got me this gift certificate to this company.
Well, I got the key out of the mouth of this wooden clown.
Never mind.
I don't like this.
No signal.
What is the going rate for a "trapped-in-the-elevator" adventure?
- Don't even think about it.
- Why not?
Read the sign. "Warning, do not attempt to open if elevator stops."
- "Use emergency..."
- "Phone"? If there was one.
"And wait for help."
So, let's just wait for help.
- Okay, I'll give you a boost.
- You can go first.
This is not gallantry.
If I don't lift you, how will you get up?
I don't know. You pull me up.
- It's easier my way. Step up.
- No.
- Oh, please.
- I'm not wearing any underwear.
Okay? There, I said it.
Okay.
- We can use this like a ladder.
- My hero. Let's go.
I don't think so.
Thank you.
Damn it, my briefoase!
I'll wait.
Not as if anybody could open it.
- Wait a minute. This is CRS.
- What's CRS?
The company I was telling you about, that gave me the gift certificate.
This is their building.
We'll wait for security to come, and we'll just explain.
They'll love that! Explain for both of us.
Wait.
We don't want to draw any attention.
We're just out for a stroll.
Run!
We can't fit down there!
- NICHOLAS: Are you trying to ditch me?
- I'm not responsible...
I'm not the one who started running!
Yeah, well, I'm not the one that started this...
- Get up there!
- I'm going!
CHRISTINE: Here.
Climb. Climb.
So where's your modesty around attack dogs?
Shut up! Stupid fucking dogs.
Let me guess. I go first.
- There goes $1,000.
- Your shoes cost $1,000?
That one did.
Here, come on.
CHRISTINE: Watch out for nails and rats.
There should be a fire escape.
That's classic.
Why me?
Who are you?
Nicholas Van Orton.
What are you, a tsar or something?
All right.
I think, if we drop from here, the garbage will break our fall.
I think not.
Be careful!
What the fuck are you looking at?
Oh, shit.
Table for two, please.
CHRISTINE: Where are we going?
That tall, bright building?
It's right near there.
POLICE OFFICER: Everything okay, miss?
Yeah. How are you doing?
San Francisco's finest.
Is there some place I could throw this?
There's a waste basket beside the desk.
I think I have a fresh sweatshirt for you somewhere.
CHRISTINE: That'd be great.
You know, you've never even asked me my name.
The maître d' said your name was Christine.
Oh, right.
I guess I'll call you a cab.
- You got a shower in your office?
- Yeah.
You an athlete or something?
No, I'm an investment banker.
I move money from one place to another.
Actually, would you mind if I just quickly rinsed off?
No.
- Is there a towel I could use?
- Yeah, it's behind the door.
- Oh. I'll just be a second.
- No problem.
Listen, I know the owner of the City Club.
I'd be happy to give him a call if you'd like.
Don't. It was a shitty job anyway.
I overreacted.
I...
I have a confession to make.
Someone gave me 400 bucks to spill drinks on you as a practical joke.
Really? And what did they say?
They said, "300," I said, "400," they said, "The guy in the gray flannel suit."
I think I said,
"The attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?"
MAN: Mr. Van Orton. I was afraid you weren't going to make it back.
- Hello?
- Mr. Van Orton? It's Maria.
I thought I should call.
- What time is it?
- It's 11:00.
I rescheduled your meeting
with Allison and Dietrich.
No, I'll be in there in an hour.
Can you... I left my briefoase at 1019 Montgomery Street.
Can you check with Lost and Found, please?
Anson Baer is at the Ritz-Carlton.
He's requesting dinner.
We'll see about that.
And the Hotel Nikko called to say
they have your American Express card.
You left it there last night?
- Should I send someone?
- Give me the number.
- 565-1111.
- I'll call you back.
- MAN: Hotel Nikko.
- This is Nicholas Van Orton.
- You have my American Express card?
- Yes, everything's in order.
There will be wine and flowers in the room,
and a young woman phoned to say
she's en routo but running late.
Did the young woman leave her name?
- I'm sure I don't know.
- Of course, you don't. Thank you.
Sorry. My fault.
Mr. Van Orton. Welcome back.
Here we go.
Have we met?
I believe so.
If you'll just sign here, on this signature card.
Thank you.
My key?
Don't I get a key?
- Didn't I give you one last night?
- No, I don't think so.
Cute. That's very cute.
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.
Have a nice stay.
(WOMAN MOANING)
(MAN BREATHING HEAVILY)
(MOANING)
WOMAN: Housekeeping.
Could you come back a little later?
Thank you, sir.
Where the fuck is he?
- Jesus!
- Why are you following me?
What are you talking about?
I'm not following you, I'm just driving.
- Whatever I'm doing is none...
- Is Anson Baer "The Game"?
- Is that what this is all about?
- Look, buddy, back off, huh?
Oh, that's cute. That's really cute.
I suppose "The Game" uses real bullets, huh?
MAN: Jesus Christ!
All right, I'm a private investigator.
Somebody hired me to keep tabs on you.
Who hired you? Who hired you?
- Mr. Van...
- Maria, get hold of Sutherland.
Have him meet me at the Ritz-Carlton.
I'm on my way.
- What's happened?
- Follow me, Sam.
Nicholas. This is unexpected.
Now, do you really believe that just because you publish children's books, people will care about my reputation?
You can have pictures of me wearing nipple rings, fucking Captain Kangaroo, they only care about the stock!
And whether that stock is up or down!
- Daddy?
- It's all right.
And the fact that you bring Conrad into this juvenile game is unconscionable.
- Are you finished?
- (SHOUTING) No, I'm not finished.
Meet my attorney, Samuel Sutherland.
The two of you have something to talk about.
We met this morning.
I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grant.
I accepted your settlement, Nicholas.
You were right. I'm going sailing.
You know, sailing.
You are welcome to join our luncheon.
Maybe we can straighten this out.
You remember my wife, Mary Carol, and my daughter-in-law, Kaleigh.
Please accept my misguided...
- How concerned should I be?
- It was a misunderstanding.
It looks a lot like you.
You should see what they do with the nightly news.
What?
- Can I ask you to do me a favor?
- You know you can.
Find out about a company called
Consumer Recreation Services.
Sounds like they make tennis racquets.
What do you know?
Wait a minute. They gave me a waiver.
- What is this?
- It's a...
What's...
I don't believe it. It's invisible ink.
You're joking.
I'm being toyed with by a bunch of depraved children. This...
Are you okay? Tell me not to worry.
You don't have to worry. I promise.
Okay.
SAM: I'll call you later.
Right. Okay, right.
Maria, last night I got a taxi for a young woman named Christine.
- What's the company we use?
- United?
- What?
- United Taxi Company.
Call them, find out who the driver was and where they took her.
Llsa?
Shit!
(SHOUTING) I have a gun!
You fuckers.
Llsa?
- Ilsa?
- Mr. Van Orton!
What's happened?
You haven't seen the house?
There's been a break-in.
Stay inside. Lock your door.
Be careful.
- WOMAN: 911 Emergency.
- I need the police.
There's been a break-in in my house.
Give me your address.
2210 Broadway.
It's the biggest house on the street.
- You said it was a break-in?
- Yes.
Are you sure they're gone?
What?
Are you sure
there's not still someone in the house?
Nickie!
- Sir, are you still there?
- Meet me at your car.
Sir?
All right, what happened?
- Conrad, where are we going?
- Just wait.
What are you doing?
If I can't trust room service in the hotel,
I can't trust the fucking car.
- Who?
- CRS.
When I think what I almost got you into.
- What are you saying?
- I'm so fucked!
They just fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.
Then when you think it's over, the real fucking starts.
Take a breath.
They won't stop, Nick.
I gave them their fucking money.
They won't leave me alone.
- What are they doing to you?
- I'm a goddamn human pinafa!
Why do they keep playing if you already paid?
I don't know.
I paid them more to make it stop.
- They did this.
- It's a flat tire.
- How do you know?
- Get a grip on yourself. We'll figure it out.
Okay. Okay.
- The phone doesn't work.
- Really?
- Can you change a tire?
- No. Can you?
I don't think we should be out in the open.
Get the Teletrac.
It's in the glove compartment.
You're with them.
- What?
- You're doing this. You're part of it.
Whose are these?
Somebody put them in the car.
- You're behind it, aren't you?
- You brought them to me.
These were in your car!
They were right there in your fucking car!
Conrad!
Listen to yourself.
- You won't control this conversation.
- Why would I do what you're describing?
- You resent me.
- Stop being emotional.
- It kills you that I'm living my life.
- Lower your voice!
You afraid someone's gonna witness a scene?
- Get back to your house!
- Stop it.
I'm calling the cops.
You're afraid someone will see what a control freak you are.
What is wrong with you?
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't live up to expectations.
- Oh, bullshit.
- I'm not you. I don't wanna be you.
- There you go again.
- I'm your brother.
Pushing the responsibility on me.
- I'm your brother!
- All I ever tried to do was help you.
I don't want your help.
Nobody asked you to play Dad.
No! You don't say that! Did I have a choice?
Did I have a choice?
Conrad!
NICHOLAS ON PHONE: All I ever tried to do
was help you.
CONRAD ON PHONE: Nobody asked you
to play Dad.
NICHOLAS ON PHONE: Did I have a choice?
Taxi!
2210 Broadway.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
Hey, buddy, you missed the turn.
Hey! Do you hear me? You missed the turn...
Oh, no. No. Stop the car. Stop the car!
Thank you. Open the door.
Unlock the door.
Open the goddamned door!
Listen, I am a very wealthy man
And whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.
Jesus...
No!
MAN: Are you out of your fucking mind?
It's a game. If it's a game...
Here they are.
- Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland.
- Tim Foley.
FOLEY: Do you know where we're going?
SAM: This way. 14th floor.
FOLEY: Okay, management for the building says the space hasn't been officially rented yet.
The County Recorder has no listing for a Consumer Recreation Service or any derivation thereof.
When the divers find the cab, they'll pull the plates.
- Have you spoken to your brother?
- He hasn't called me back yet.
- What about the house?
- The graffiti was oil-based.
- Illegal in the States.
- It's not impossible to trace.
The photo, the gun, the clown, the ambulance, it's all pending.
Breaking and entering, we got solid.
Malicious mischief, vandalism and harassment.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Attempted murder.
Except you said you hired these guys.
- That's irrelevant.
- No, look.
It's our job to tell you what we've got.
So far we don't have a motive.
What was my father like, Ilsa?
Why do you ask?
I don't know.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
- I guess he was just on my mind.
- Your mother loved your father very much.
I think he just worked too hard.
NICHOLAS: Was he...
Morose? I mean...
What I remember most was that his manner was so slight.
You could spend time in a room and not know he'd been there the whole time.
No, what I mean is...
- Before he...
- What happened? No.
Nobody expected it.
I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
- Was Mother worried about him?
- Nobody ever worried about your father.
Yes.
MARIA: I found the address from United Taxi.
Give it to me.
Who are you?
Christine, is she here?
She's sleeping.
CHRISTINE: Amy, who is it?
- What are you doing here?
- Can we talk?
Sure.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Didn't think I'd see you again.
- What can you tell me about these?
Is this you?
- Where'd you get them?
- My hotel room.
It was in my hotel room.
Are you telling me this is not you?
What makes you think this is me?
The bra, the red bra.
Okay.
Well, I thought that...
- Can I sit down for a minute?
- Sure.
Are you all right?
You're not all right, are you?
Is it this contest thing that you're in still, or...
I'm sorry. I should go.
No, it's okay.
I'll put some clothes on and be right back.
Do you have an aspirin?
Can I get you something to drink?
Is this you?
Oh, yeah, that's First Communion.
- Show it to me.
- What's wrong?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
All right.
- (WHISPERING) They're watching.
- What?
Not here. They can see.
The smoke detector.
What do you say...
Let's go for a drive or something.
No, no, no. I am tired of this.
- I am goddamn tired of this.
- We'll go for a drink, then.
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are...
Come on out of there!
- Nicholas, please!
- Let's go.
Come out of there right now!
Now you've done it.
Shit!
- So what are they gonna do?
- Get away from the window.
What the...
(RADIO CRACKLING)
- What is this?
- Wake up. It's a fucking con.
CHRISTINE: Get in!
You all right? Hold on.
Get out of the car.
- I could've handed you to them.
- Get out of the goddamn car!
You don't have a choice. No one else is gonna tell you what's going on.
You wanna know?
'Cause if I'm gone, you never will.
They didn't take the time to get the fucking house right.
- Who are they?
- I don't know. I'm an employee.
- Then what good are you?
- Your brother was in on it.
That's a lie.
Yeah? I was your waitress on your birthday.
Connie told you about CRS.
Sorry. It wasn't his fault.
I guess he thought it was his only way out.
They fleeced him real good.
- How did they get to him?
- Same thing they did to you.
- What are you talking about?
- You checked your accounts?
I got the number to your modem.
That gave CRS remote access to your computer.
- You gave them everything else.
- What?
You took their tests.
Handwriting, psych info.
They used it all to figure out your passwords.
Feingold, the guy who signed you up, he did five years for hacking Citibank.
They broke into your financial network, transferred your holdings into dummy accounts.
Overseas operator, please.
- Why else are they shooting at us?
- Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Because they're finished with you.
Alive or dead's the same.
As long as you disappear.
Yes. Blue, 2, backslash,
9690, D as in David.
That's right.
The balance?
- That's impossible.
- They already got it, Nicholas.
They got everything.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: This is
the Sutherlands. Please leave a message.
Sam, I have checked them all.
I don't know how, but they have drained my accounts.
They're trying to kill me. Call the cops.
I've got one of them right here.
We'll make her testity.
I know how this sounds, but you call me, on my cellular.
And you be careful.
He cut your card in half, so...
My treat.
You take two sugars, right?
Never mind.
My name's not Christine. It's...
Who fucking cares?
It's just money.
You should be glad you're alive.
I'd rather not talk about it right now.
- Someone like you...
- How many times have you done this?
- What?
- These scams, con games. How many?
Lots.
Whatever bullshit you pulled in the past, this is more than just me.
This is pension plans, payrolls.
This is $600 million.
- Yes.
- Nick, it's Sam. I got your message.
I was disturbed.
- So what are we gonna do?
- I've been on the phone already.
Nicholas, your funds are intact.
Nothing's been touched.
I checked on them myself.
- CHRISTINE: Who is it?
- I made the calls.
Nothing's changed.
Not one cent is unaccounted for.
Who is it?
- My attorney says nothing is missing.
- He's in on it.
Stay where you are until I get there.
- Sutherland's in on it.
- Nicholas, I have another call.
Give me your precise location.
Nicholas?
Gotta get out of here.
How did they get to him?
Why did...
I wouldn't worry about it.
What do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
CHRISTINE: Cellular calls can be intercepted.
All those calls you made,
B of A, France, Switzerland...
You were talking to us.
You filled in the blanks, access codes and passwords.
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.
We have it now so we're done.
Bye, Nicholas.
Embassy? American?
Thank you.
Things have happened and it's important...
No money, no identification, no passport.
What happened to you?
(SIGHS) Where to begin...
- It's complicated.
- It always is.
I was on holiday alone and I was robbed by two men...
Robbed?
What hotel were you staying at?
I don't remember. I...
Have you gone to the police?
I don't speak Spanish.
And I just need enough to get out of here.
We'll help with the local law enforcement if you want.
As far as money is concerned, can I make a suggestion?
You say you were mugged?
And they didn't take that watch?
How much is a watch like that worth?
A couple of hundred at least.
A man with a watch like that doesn't necessarily have a passport problem.
Excuse me.
Can I have your attention, please?
Thank you.
Anybody here going to San Francisco?
I need a ride.
I got $18.78...
For a ride to San Francisco.
Anybody?
(MEN CHATTERING ON RADIO)
Keep the change.
Conrad Van Orton.
Could you ring his room, please?
One moment, please.
Is there a problem?
- You're here for Conrad Van Orton?
- Yes.
- I'm the hotel manager.
- Where is my brother?
- Will you come with me?
- Wait a minute. Is there trouble?
Sir, this is a private matter for you.
There were complaints by other guests, damage to his room.
We did our best to accommodate his behavior.
- His behavior?
- There was an incident a few days ago.
A nervous breakdown, they said.
The police took him.
They left this address in case anyone came.
It's a hospital in Napa, sir.
I'm terribly sorry.
NICHOLAS: Elizabeth,
I need to borrow your car.
Nickie, what happened to you? I mean...
- Look at you.
- What happened? I don't know.
There's things I have to do and I need your car.
Of course you can have it.
Can't I get you something to eat?
You know you're the only person that I can trust?
Everyone else... If Sam Sutherland calls, don't tell him you talked to me.
You lie to him and whatever else happens...
WAITRESS:
Coffee, English muffin and your water.
This bottle is open.
Who opened this bottle?
- I opened it.
- I don't want it.
I want an unopened bottle.
I don't want ice, just the glass.
Please.
Nickie, talk to me. You're scaring me.
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- I'm sorry, Liz, I don't mean to. I'm sorry.
I've been thinking the last couple of days,
I've had some spare time...
And I wanted to tell you that...
I understand why you left me.
And I know that I resented it.
I want to apologize to you for shutting you out...
For not being there.
I hope you can forgive me.
JIM: You're tired.
You've been on the go for days.
There's nothing to forgive.
Pain sets in.
The onset of a migraine headache.
If this sounds all too familiar,
relief is here at last.
No. You bastards!
Taggarene. For nearly a decade...
How did you find me here?
Taggarene is strong medicine
for headaches, toothaches...
He's an actor.
So if you trust your doctor,
trust Taggarene.
He's an actor on television.
Some day I'll explain.
Could I borrow your Yellow Pages?
Okay...
New Moon Cafè.
Best in Chinatown.
Get out of the car, fucker.
Open the door and leave it running.
- You're making a mistake.
- Get out of the car.
- Get the fuck out of the car.
- I am extremely fragile right now.
New Moon Cafè.
- He does commercials.
- You know how many customers we have?
I know he ordered from you.
It went to Montgomery Street.
Can anybody help me?
He's an actor, like one of these people you have up here on your...
Hey, where are you taking my picture?
We were hoping he could audition today.
He would be perfect for this part.
- WOMAN: This will break his heart.
- Is there any place to contact him?
His beeper's here.
He took the kids to the zoo.
- The zoo? That's very sweet. Which zoo?
- The one with the white tiger.
Lionel Fisher, I love your work.
Okay, please, can I... I got my kids.
Get rid of them.
All right, guys. Snack time.
More snacks. Go, go, go.
Look...
It was just a job. Nothing personal.
I play my part. Improvise a little.
- It's what I'm good at.
- I need to talk to who's in charge.
Nobody knows. Nobody gets the big picture.
Tammy, Alex, cut it out!
Why do they do that?
The offices are empty.
I need to find out where they are.
Look, they own the whole building.
They just move from floor to floor.
And you work for them, right?
You can get me in.
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Tell them the police called. Tell them
I'm gonna blow the whistle on them.
What whistle? There's no whistle.
This is very dangerous.
I don't think you understand.
Right now I am extremely dangerous.
Michael, guys, come on, we're leaving.
- Well, we're here.
- Drive in.
What are you gonna do anyway?
You won't get your money back.
I don't care about money.
I'm pulling back the curtain.
I wanna meet the wizard.
Hey.
- He's eyeing us like Tiffeny Towers.
- Pull in where they won't see you.
(WALKIE-TALKIE CRACKLING)
Shit. Stay down.
- You're not allowed to be here.
- They called me back. I got a fitting.
He's with me.
- You don't need me.
- Shut up.
Get in there.
Cuff him to the rail.
What floor?
(ELEVATOR MUSIC PLAYING)
SECURITY GUARD: You're fucked!
- Where?
- They hired me over the phone.
- Where'd you pick up your checks?
- It was a different floor.
- Guess.
- This way. Sort of.
I don't know. I...
Take it easy now.
This is gonna be a surprise.
Oh, fuck!
What are you doing here?
Back from the dead.
Nicholas, you're not about to shoot anyone.
Turn around.
You're gonna come with me.
Everybody, down!
CHRISTINE: Where are we going?
Stop!
- What do you think you're doing?
- You tell me!
Who's behind this? Who did this to me?
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
How deluded can you be?
It could've been any asshole with a couple of hundred million in the bank.
Get your boss up here.
Tell him I'm gonna shoot someone.
They won't do it.
Oh, yes, they will. Get someone up here because I'm gonna kill you.
They'll let me die.
You're not in a position to threaten anyone.
- Where'd you get that?
- What?
That gun. That's not an automatic.
- What are you talking about?
- Where'd you get the gun?
- This is my gun.
- We searched the house.
Well, I guess you missed this.
We got a real goddamn gun up here.
(WALKIE-TALKIE CRACKLING)
- This is fake. It's part of your game.
- Don't start with me!
- Listen to me!
- Don't you fucking start with me!
This is all the game.
Bullshit. They shot that guy Feingold, Fisher.
- They killed him. I saw them kill him.
- What did you really see this whole time?
Special effects. Squibs, like in the movies.
Nicholas, listen!
He's got a real gun. Okay, I'll put it down!
Fisher's behind that door. He's an actor.
- You're trying to kill me.
- No one's trying to kill you.
You're about to make a big mistake.
There was a safety net.
The taxi, there was a diver.
- We were shot at with blanks.
- That's not true.
It's what you hired us for.
They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne.
It's Conrad. Conrad's there!
It's your birthday party.
You stop lying!
Let me show you.
Don't you move.
He's got a gun! Get back from the door!
You shot him.
Someone call an ambulance!
He's dead.
We thought you knew.
JIM: How did you let this get so out of hand?
He wouldn't listen to me.
JIM: We went through this over and over.
JIM: The mark is your responsibility.
You never, never let the mark take over.
CHRISTINE: I'm sorry.
- JIM: You had a walkie-talkie.
- I used it.
We're going to jail. We're all going to jail for the rest of our lives.
Oh, God.
Nicholas!
MAN 1: We got him. He's in the bag.
MAN 2: He came in right on target.
Stand by for a further medical.
Keep them back until
we clear away the breakaway glass.
MAN 2: Don't open your eyes.
This is breakaway glass but it can still cut you.
(MEN CHATTERING ON WALKIE-TALKIES)
MAN 1: I'm just gonna take a look.
MAN 2: I'm gonna check your pulse.
Take it easy. That was quite a fall.
Happy birthday, Nickie.
What is this?
It's your birthday present.
I had to do something.
You were becoming such an asshole.
Ladies and gentlemen, my brother, Nicholas Van Orton.
Amazing. I just wanted to tell you.
This was the best ever.
Thank God you jumped. If you didn't,
I was supposed to throw you off.
We have to head home.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Rachel, sweet dreams.
Thanks, Mel, for coming.
Sorry about your car.
- I left it at the zoo.
- No problem.
Happy birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call you. I really will.
Nicholas, I haven't a clue what this is all about, but your taste in champagne is excellent, as always.
It was a great entrance.
I want you to know...
No, please.
I've never been happier in my whole life.
I thank you and my wife thanks you.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you, Sam.
- What's this?
- This is...
The bill.
- NICHOLAS: The bill?
- Keep the pen.
Thank you. Both.
Wanna split it?
Oh, God, yes, please.
I'll take you up on that.
Oh, my God.
Thank you, Connie.
What happened to that waitress?
What was her name...
Christine?
She said something about catching a plane.
I saw her hailing a cab.
Christine?
I...
- I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
- Well, thank you. I...
I never did ask you your name, did I?
No. It's Clare.
So you're catching a plane?
Yeah, we have a gig starting next week in Australia.
- You gonna shear some more sheep?
- Just a walk-on this time.
Well, when you get back...
Maybe we could have some dinner.
You don't know anything about me.
No, I don't.
So you tell me.
- Well...
- Where you're from.
Originally? Oklahoma.
Colorado?
I've been doing this way too long.
You know...
Would you like to have a coffee with me at the airport?
Look alive!
Damn it!
Goddamn it!
You call that blocking, you pussy-pukes?
You gotta pick up the linebacker!
Goddamn it! Get off the fucking field, you limp-ass blowdicks!
Consider yourselves dead
Friday night! Dead!
You gonna rejoin the living tomorrow, Stan?
You've got to feel the pressure closing in on you!
Then you get rid of the rock!
Now get focused or get the fuck off my team!
- Shit!
- Let it go.
This better be important or somebody's gonna be doing laps until sunrise.
Yeah? What?
Please let me finish this so we can go home. It's late.
Mrs Brummel, with all sadness, no new computers.
But...
Get the service guy down here and get the old ones juiced.
Mr Tate, you're dreaming.
Absolutely no field trips to New York City.
I don't think that you understand.
You're not getting out of Ohio. Rethink it.
And, finally,
Mrs Olson.
There's just no money for a musical this year.
But I bet the football team gets their new jerseys and their new equipment.
Have you seen the football stadium on a Friday night, Mr Tate?
The entire town is there. This is a football town, let me remind you, and, yes, the team will get new jerseys and new knee pads... and new jock straps and anything else they want in the name of education... because that is what the school board wants.
Because that is what the parents in this town want.
I'm sorry.
My frustrated hands are tied.
I don't see why we can't have a few new computers... so the children will learn a little set up.
Miss Drake, the Drama Club had their heart set on Guys and Dolls this year.
Well... maybe if they use last year's set from Our Town.
Shit, I forgot my keys.
I have to go back.
See you in the morning,
Mrs Olson.
Coach Willis.
What can I do for you?
You look... very, very pretty tonight,
- Miss Drake.
- Have you been drinking, Coach?
I'm sorry to bother you, but...
I can't seem to find a pencil.
You don't need a pencil, Coach.
You need a good night's sleep.
- I need a pencil.
- Sleep it off, Coach.
Do you have a pencil?
Jesus Christ, yes, I have a pencil.
I have plenty of pencils.
Look, why don't you and your pencil go home. It's late.
You look... very, very pretty tonight.
Harassment has a really fine line,
Coach. Haven't you read your handbook?
I've always wanted to do that.
Would Miss Drake please report... to the principal's office?
- I forgot my grade book.
- Unlock the door! Coach Willis attacked me!
- Unlock the door, goddamn it!
- I don't have my keys.
- Let me get help.
- No, don't leave me!
- Where are your keys?
- Wait...
In the office.
I'm gonna get my keys now,
Mrs Olson.
- Please, let me get help.
- No, just talk to me, okay?
Miss Drake... please be careful.
He's insane.
Miss Drake, he's coming!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry, Miss Drake!
Hurry!
Hurry!
- Shit!
- No!
Hurry!
Help me!
Prick.
I always wanted to do that.
You fucking bitch!
What the hell were you doing?
Whatever.
All right?
Sorry. My fault.
Crash and burn, Casey.
Get out of the fucking car, you stupid bitch!
Goddamn you!
- You okay?
- Walk much?
You ran into me, beast.
Okay, now listen up.
Since we're all wearing the same uniforms, let's keep the hair the same.
No hair spray, no teasing, just elegant.
- Simple. Great.
- Hey.
Stan, watch it. Those are Estee Lauder lips.
Takes 72 minutes to apply.
Sorry.
- Hey, can we talk?
- I can't right now.
I need a new headline for the school paper. It's important.
- So is this.
- I'm sure you think so, honey.
In fact... it could be just the story you're looking for.
Do the words "editor-in-chief" mean anything to you?
Leave the news to me, okay?
Later.
That chick weakens legs, meat.
- One, two, three...
- No, not the pole!
Yeah, do it again!
Yeah!
Excuse me.
Could you please tell me where the office is? It's my first day here.
Thank you.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson.
I really love what you've done with your nose ring. It brings out the colour in your eyes.
You're such a fucking pussy.
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!
Dude, that's not me.
Doesn't even look like me.
It's fifty bucks, right?
- Does that look like me?
- It's the new you.
I don't know, man. How do we know these things are even gonna work?
Trust me, man.
I'm brilliant.
Then why are you repeating your senior year?
All right, look, man.
I'll throw in a couple hits of this.
Scat. My own recipe.
Guaranteed to jack you up.
Up the nose, right?
Whatever works, man.
Fuck.
Excuse me, Mr Tate.
Try to remember, Harry, the projector's got teeth.
Sharp ones.
We should be getting hazard pay for this sort of faulty equipment.
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, good morning, Miss Harper.
I...
I called you this weekend.
I got your machine.
How's your cold?
- I can't get rid of it.
- Hello. How are you today?
A bit tired, but no complaints.
I got it.
Can we say,
"retirement"?
Maybe you should just go home.
No, thank you.
I'm saving my sick days for when I feel better.
Maybe I should just put a pen in my eye.
When will that bitch turn the air conditioning back on?
Hey, speaking of which, has anybody seen Principal Drake?
Maybe she had a sunstroke and died.
What's up with the coach?
He's thirsty.
Probably a pregame ritual.
Just looking at him makes me want to take a piss.
Good morning, Mrs Olson.
You look very, very pretty today.
So... what was Crusoe's... greatest fear?
Anyone?
Yes, Zeke.
Crusoe's afraid that he'd be stuck on that island forever... with nothing but calluses.
No, that's not correct.
Isolation was his greatest fear.
Yes, but... his external existence in no way compared... to the internal agony of the loneliness he felt.
That's very good.
Like I said, calluses.
So Cathy tells me one thing, and then Liz says another... and then, of course,
Jenny's got her own story, so which one do you want me to print?
Print them all.
He's a jerk.
- Hey, we need to talk.
- No, Stan, baby, I'm in a crunch.
Could we back-burner it?
- I'm quitting football.
- You're not playing tomorrow?
I'm not playing this year.
Would you listen to me?
I'm quitting the team.
I'm not playing ball... anymore.
What brought this on?
Well, I've been weighing the importance of being a jock...
- with my impending future, and I decided...
- You just decided?
Stan, what about college? The football scholarship is your only shot.
If I quit now, I can work harder at studying, maybe raise my grades a little.
I'd rather go to college... based on my intellect.
You're not good at studying.
Stan, you're good at football.
Stick to what you're good at.
Yeah, I've always been good at football and basketball and every other sport I try.
I think maybe it's time I try something
I'm not so good at, something different.
And what am I supposed to do while you're on a yellow-brick quest for a brain?
- What?
- The accepted social order... is head cheerleaders date star quarterbacks, not academic wanna-bes.
Don't be superficial.
"Superficial."
Four syllables.
That's really good, Stan.
You're on your way.
Let me know how the cancer cure goes.
I was hoping you'd be with me on this.
Now, if everyone will turn to chapter four:
"The Nation of the State."
"Only through conformity among the masses... can the unified state offer the benefits of power order and security."
Actually, we covered that last week, Mr Tate.
We're on chapter five.
Whatever.
Now if you could all please join Stan on chapter five:
"Individual Action in Society."
What are you reading?
Double Star.
Robert Heinlein.
You one of those science fiction people?
Y'all believe in alternate universes and alien beings and stuff?
I'm feeling pretty alien myself today.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson of Atlanta. I'm new here.
- No shit.
- What's your name?
Why do you want to know my name?
'Cause I don't have any friends.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to have one less than that.
- So I just thought... - Stokely, are you seducing the new students again?
Hi. I'm Delilah.
- Happy to have you at Herrington.
- Thank you.
Don't you love the way Stokely accessorizes different shades of black in her ensemble?
- Fuck you, gutter slut.
- I don't know why you insist... on being such a bad example for your people.
- What people? - I hope you're not a violent lesbian like your new friend.
No.
I'm not aware of any lesbianism in my lineage.
That's too bad, Stokely. You'll just have to keep looking for Miss Right.
Bipolar bitch.
Violent.
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- I was just eating my lunch, sir.
This ain't the cafeteria, son.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, sir.
You're...
- I forget your name.
- Casey.
Right.
I've seen you around.
You're not really into sports.
I don't think a person should run unless he's being chased.
"Being chased."
I like that.
Get outta here.
- Mrs Brummel, may I have a word with you?
- Certainly.
Man, get a fucking eye dog.
Maybe if you didn't paint your fucking eyes shut.
- Mr Furlong.
- Present.
Found something on the football field.
Thought you might want to take a look.
- What is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
Want to be lab partners?
I didn't know you were a lesbian.
I don't think
I've ever met one before.
Have you been out long?
I think it's very impressive and evolved of you...
I'm not a lesbian, all right?
Be one. Please.
Fly free.
You were right about me. I don't have any friends, and I like it that way.
- Being a lesbian is just my security.
- Your security against what?
People like you.
Complex.
Certain mesozoan... only exist in the kidney of certain squid and octopi.
- Which doesn't make sense because...
- This is Ohio.
Right.
It's a pelagic organism.
- What's pelagic?
- A sea-dwelling organism.
Exactly.
But I don't recognize this surface tissue at all.
Casey, I don't want to blow smoke up your butt, but I think you found a new species.
Yeah, right.
It could happen. New species are discovered every day.
- Don't be so cynical.
- Could it be gnathostomulida?
- No. - They escaped detection till the mid-20th century.
You just know everything.
I'm a contradiction.
Check the mesodermic follicles on its underbelly.
- What does that mean?
- It means we gotta call the university, let them take a look, maybe get in on some of that federal grant money.
Our secret... all right?
- Hey, Stokely, maybe it's from your planet.
- Blow me, blood fart.
Did you see that?
What is it doing?
- You think it's amphibian?
- Water resuscitated it.
Yeah, but couldn't this kill it?
Yeah, you don't want to drown it.
- One way to find out.
- Man.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Mr Furlong, what are you doing?
I'm just gonna check his prostate.
Actually, the surface texture changed, so... I want to feel it.
It can replicate.
Jesus.
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
- I'm okay.
- It has teeth.
Where did it get teeth?
I'm gonna call the university.
I've just been thinking ahead, Coach, and...
I've decided to quit the team... and concentrate on my academics.
Okay.
Stan, we'll miss you.
That's it?
Well, what do you want me to say?
My star quarterback comes to me the day before we play Brun County, the only team in the district that can kick our ass, and tells me he doesn't want to play.
There's something up with that.
You seem to be going through some life-defining turning point, and I'm not gonna stand in the way of the human condition.
You do what you have to do.
Thanks for not reaming me,
Coach.
What kind of human being would I be if I did that?
Hey, give me that back.
Hey, yo, piss wad, you're in my way.
I'm sorry.
I was breathing here.
Yeah, that's the problem.
You're occupying my air, you anal probe.
Hey.
Yo, Stan.
Tomorrow night, right?
That's right.
We'll kill them!
We draw blood! Yeah!
- It must really blow being you.
- You have no idea.
Yo, Casey, is that you?
- Mrs Brummel, what the fuck...
- Please.
Help me.
I can't breathe.
Get help!
You don't know what's happening.
They want everyone.
It's okay.
Is Mrs Brummel gonna be okay?
Stan, Mrs Brummel has been diagnosed with cancer, and she's on a lot of medication at the moment.
It causes disorientation.
We were hoping that she would get through the school year, but unfortunately it...
I hope you can understand the sensitive nature of the situation.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I can keep it quiet.
Casey? You understand?
Casey, you understand?
- Casey?
- Yeah.
Sure.
- It's Neve Campbell?
- And Jennifer Love Hewitt, right?
Yep.
Party of prettiness.
- And they're naked?
- Full frontal.
Zeke, you cannot conduct personal business on school property.
Well, Miss Burke, we have a problem... because I'm sitting on my car and that's my property.
Well, I've had complaints from several students... that you've sold them mind-altering substances.
You want to tell me about it or take it up with Principal Drake?
You're too tense, Miss Burke, but I've got just the thing for you.
You know, Zeke, I'm the authority figure here. It's time you realized that.
"For gentle relief of blockage caused by dietary stress."
- Chocolate-flavoured laxatives.
- You know... if you applied just five percent...
- of that intellect to your studies,
- Not a chocolate lover? you could have made up your finals last summer.
- You didn't have to repeat your senior year.
- How about these?
Condoms.
Magnum-sized, and they're cherry-flavoured.
Come on, Miss Burke.
They're on me.
That's so rude.
I need a lead story.
I have no page one.
Well, we found a new phylum in Biology. It's bizarre.
Really bizarre. Mr Furlong thinks it might be a new species.
Let me race to the stands for that issue.
- Why do you rag on me so much? What did I do?
- Nothing.
It's just your fate.
You're that geeky Stephen King kid.
There's one of you in every school.
- We can't go in here.
- Come on, Casey.
You're with me.
Be brave.
Okay, so what are we looking for?
Anything.
Nurse Harper is medicated.
Big surprise.
Hey.
No, I exposed Mr Tate's alcoholism last year. Nobody cares.
Well, his wife certainly didn't when she ran off with the baby-sitter.
God.
- You can be such a...
- What? pretty cool human being when you're not being a first-class, grade-A bitch.
You hitting on me, Casey?
No. No.
I just think you can be cool.
Sometimes.
This not being one of them.
- Where's Brummel?
- She didn't make it.
Her body was too old.
The heat got to her.
Be careful of the climate.
It compromises your nervous system.
It makes one impulsive.
Has the entire faculty been commuted?
Almost.
- What about the students?
- Soon.
What are you two still doing here?
I thought I was the only left.
There are not enough drugs in this world.
What?
I have a pain.
Right here.
Get off of me! Jesus!
Casey!
What the hell is going on?
- Slow down there. - Help us.
They killed Mrs Brummel. They're after us.
What are you talking about?
- Coach Willis.
- And Mrs Olson.
- What's going on?
- Ask Nurse Harper, okay? They attacked her.
Who attacked who?
What is going on?
I have no idea. I joined this right in the middle of it.
Mrs Brummel wigged out in the shower, and then we found her body in the faculty closet.
What were you doing in the faculty closet?
- Coach Willis and Mrs Olson attacked
Nurse Harper. - Why would they do that?
There's Nurse Harper.
Just ask her.
Now we can get to the bottom of this.
- Fuck.
- Delilah, run!
Delilah, wait!
In here?
Yes. The body was in the closet.
- And why would Mrs Brummel be in the closet?
- Because they killed her.
- That's right.
- Hey, Casey.
Sorry about that mix-up earlier.
Didn't mean to scare you.
Apparently, there's been a misunderstanding.
Still, if we could just see inside the closet.
Certainly.
- It's a doll.
- Meet Resuscitation Annie.
We use her to teach C.P.R. to the students, although I guess she does resemble Mrs Brummel slightly.
- You dialled 911 for a dead doll?
- That wasn't there.
They put that there.
Look, I'm not making this up.
- You gotta call Delilah.
- We called her. She isn't home.
She was here with me.
She saw it too.
They attacked Nurse Harper.
- Nurse Harper is epileptic. She's prone to grand mals. - She had an attack.
Luckily, she carries her medicine in her bag, so we were able to help her.
We think it was brought on by this terrible cold she's had. I took her home myself.
- You can call her if you like.
- It is procedure.
You can use the phone in my office.
That was some fast running you did down the hall, son.
We could sure use your speed.
There's plenty of chasing on the field.
Did you hear that, Casey?
He said you had speed.
- Thank you.
- Good luck in that game tomorrow, Coach.
This way.
Cas, what's gotten into you?
Evelyn knows someone downtown.
A professional.
I'm gonna make an appointment.
He's a straight-A student, and now he needs a professional?
- Christ.
- I don't need a shrink. I know what I saw.
Well, we've just spoken... with both Mrs Brummel and Nurse Harper.
- They got him.
- There's nothing here.
Just some kid looking for some attention. Let's go.
All right.
Well...
I am so sorry,
Miss Drake.
Maybe if you and I spoke privately, we could come up with...
No. No, Mom.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should see this woman, this doctor.
Can we just go?
We'll take care of this at home, Miss
Drake. Again, sorry for all the trouble.
I can see how it all got out of hand.
It's a pretty bizarre series of events.
It's our fault.
It won't happen again.
See you tomorrow, Casey.
Check his school books.
They hide the drugs in the spine of the book. We saw it on Dateline.
- What are you on, son?
- I'm not on drugs.
That's government property, Dad.
Shit.
Look, we love you, son.
We want to help you.
Then believe me.
I'm telling the truth.
Something really weird is happening at school. The teachers...
- Something's happened to them.
- Don't push it, all right?
- I'm bending as far as I can, but if you push it... - Just let me call Delilah.
Please?
Okay, that's it.
Your privileges are now over.
No phone. Sorry. Over.
No internet.
You'll go to school, straight to school, and you'll come straight home. You got it?
I'm not going back to that school.
They're waiting for me.
You'll go. If I have to tie you to the desk myself, you'll go.
No music.
His porno.
Porno.
Sorry, pal. No more flogging the bishop.
We are gonna get you help. Don't worry.
Get your room cleaned up.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Dad. They're here.
The faculty.
Get in the house, now.
I'm losing it.
- Go on, son.
- Dad, I'm begging you.
Please.
Come home right after school.
Your mom's looking into a doctor.
Mr Connor.
Delilah.
Wow, you look...
Don't. Come on.
Your attention, please.
Will the following students report to the office:
James Archuleta,
Tina Dannhausen, and Delilah Proffitt.
- This is all your fault.
- What do you mean?
Do you think I'm in drag for the aesthetics?
They're after me.
- Did you tell your parents?
- My mom didn't believe me.
She drinks.
It was a nightmare.
- Look, we have to go to the police.
- No.
- They've got the police.
- We don't know what they've got.
Look, you saw it.
Mrs Brummel was dead.
- They attacked Nurse Harper.
- "They"? Who are "they"?
Casey, we don't even know who "they" are.
Why did she act like everything was okay?
It's a devil's cult or something.
Maybe they worship comets.
Who the fuck knows?
I'm not gonna stay in a handicapped bathroom for the rest of my life.
- They couldn't have gotten to everyone.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find Stan.
- Stan? Why Stan?
Will the following students please report to the office:
Jennifer Qulick,
Randy Knotson and Thomas Nicks.
You should just go talk to him.
No way.
I'm sorry.
So you... Are you ready for the big game?
I quit the team.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
Why?
Just tired of everyone kissing my ass
'cause I'm captain of the football team.
You know... the coach, the students, even the teachers.
Last year after we won the 2A Conference...
That was thanks to you and your completed passes.
You follow the games?
I wouldn't have guessed that.
I made a "D" on a biology test right after, and Mr Furlong changed it to an "A."
He said I deserved for having such a strong arm.
That really bugged me, you know?
I worked hard for that "D."
That was my "D." I deserved that "D."
I just wish people would let me be, you know...
A "D" student.
Yeah.
Okay, class, listen up.
Today we are going to write a living family history.
Everyone take out a piece of paper and write down the name... of every living member of your family.
Begin with your immediate family... those living with you... then include the names of your nearest living relatives.
What?
- Is this gonna be on the test?
- This is the test.
What is that?
It's magic dust.
- You want some?
- No, I have a low tolerance, but thank you.
- You sure?
- I'm allergic to aspirin, so that would probably kill me.
- We wouldn't want to do that.
- No.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson of Atlanta.
Atlanta.
I know.
That's right.
You know everything.
I'm Zeke.
- I know.
- It's a pleasure.
The pleasure's all mine.
There's a mandatory meeting in the office at lunch today for all club presidents.
Remember, tonight we take on the Brun County Changa.
- Please come at 5:30 and show your support.
- Hey, that's mine.
Weird, isn't it?
- What do you think it is?
- Locker search maybe?
Something weird is going on here.
Hey, Football.
Hey, Gabe.
- You're not pissed, are you?
- About what?
I'm the new team captain.
What's going on here?
Nurse Harper, she's giving an ear exam or some shit like that.
And that takes the police?
Stan, I need to talk to you.
I didn't know you wore glasses.
Contacts.
Come on, it's important.
Stokely, got a second?
I need your help.
So after the accident, I came here to live with relatives, you know.
So I moved in with my cousins and... here I am.
Fucking do something, you pussy puke!
Yeah, my mom and dad are dead too.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They're still breathing, but for all intents and purposes, they're very much dead.
You've fucking gone weird.
Fuck you, you pussy.
- Fuck you!
- You and I have a lot in common then.
Yeah.
- You notice anything off today here at school?
- I'm from the south.
- Y'all are off.
- Dude, we need some scat.
Yeah, man, we can't deal.
There's some weird shit going down here.
Five bucks a pop. Hey, man, how's the new you working out?
Working out just fine.
Hey, you got any more?
- Sure, man.
- Really?
Why don't you give us all you got?
All right.
Dough.
- You got any more?
- Not on me, man.
- What about in your locker?
- How about in your car? Got any more there?
- Use in moderation, boys.
- Come on, Zeke. Hook us up.
- Check out Miss Burke.
- Wow, what happened to her?
Man, I'm really not in the mood,
Miss Burke. I'm clean.
- What's up with her?
- Not today.
It's too damn hot, and I got zero-fucking-tolerance.
Eat me, you asshole. I'm the one with no tolerance, you pathetic little runt.
Ouch. Comeback.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call my mother?
And how am I supposed to do that, little Zekey boy?
Do you even know where she is?
Europe, Sri Lanka, Japan? I wonder what remote location she went to this week... to hide from her great big bastard mistake.
I've taken your shit for too fucking long, you dickless drug-induced excuse for a human being.
- Woman, what are you on?
- "Woman"? Did you just say, "woman"?
I'm sick of you, little boy.
And if I see you peddling your wonder dust again,
I'm gonna shove my foot so far up your ass... you'll be sucking my toes till graduation.
Big trouble.
She got some bad shit.
And then they chased us, but we got away.
All this started when Mrs Brummel did a wet and wild...
- in the boys' locker room?
- I think so.
Everybody's been acting really strange, especially the faculty.
Tell me about it. It's like they've all turned into fucking pod people...
- or something.
- Into what people?
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A small town was taken over by aliens.
That was a joke.
Look, what if it really happened?
- What if that really happened?
- I think something's taking over our school.
The Body Snatchers is a story somebody made up, dingus.
It's located in the fiction section of the library.
So is Schindler's List. All fiction is based on some truth, right?
What does Miss Burke teach us in English 101? Write what you know.
How do we know this writer guy...
- Jack Finney.
- didn't encounter aliens in his high school... which led him to write a book about an alien invasion?
- Your conspiracy theory is flawed.
- How so?
Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers is a blatant rip-off... of The Puppet Masters by Robert Heinlein.
So you can completely disregard that entire work.
Whatever.
The point is they're here, they've been here and they're here again.
You know, Casey, I think you've been racked into the flagpole one too many times.
Look, how do you know there's not a conspiracy?
Maybe X-Files is right.
Where do all these movies come from anyway?
How do we know Spielberg,
Lucas, Sonnenfeld,
Emmerich haven't been visited by aliens?
You know, maybe they're aliens themselves.
Maybe they're simply preparing us for what's to come.
You know what, Casey, it's fiction. Okay?
- It's science fiction.
- Exactly.
Everybody gets hung up on the science part, which has nothing to do with it.
They're getting at us through the fiction.
So, aliens have just been setting us up over the years, creating this happy little make-believe existence... with their E.T. and their Men In Black movies... just so that nobody would believe it if it really happened?
I think so.
Yeah.
- You're not buying this, are you?
- No, I'm not.
But it's kind of cool.
Okay, so what's missing?
Well, in The Body Snatchers, they were pods, but where are they?
I mean, where are the pods?
There are no pods.
There's gotta be something else.
In Puppet Masters, they were parasites.
- I filled Stan in.
- Come with us. Stokely's onto something.
Really?
Shit.
Furlong must have sent it up to the university.
- Doubtful.
- Where else could it be?
What? What is it?
Will someone please tell me what the hell's going on here?
It all started yesterday when
I found this thing, this new species.
Which is now missing.
We think aliens are taking over our school.
Right. Come on.
You saw what Brummel did in the shower.
I saw her dead body in the closet.
They've been calling students into the office.
The students with the most influence on down, including the new team captain.
Looks like you picked the right week to quit football.
You think aliens have infested our school?
That would explain their weird behaviour, wouldn't it?
Give me a fucking break.
So, what are we doing in here?
Shopping.
- I've got a very large grocery list.
- What are you talking about?
This is where
I get my equipment.
You borrow it from science labs?
I like to think of it as stealing, actually.
Just doing my part to the deconstruction of America.
So if anybody finds us in here, just grab ahold of me and pretend we're making out.
The punishment will be less severe.
- Aliens?
- Do you have a better explanation, Stan?
Great. Just listen to yourselves.
Our teachers are aliens?
That's not weird, that's fucking psychotic.
Come on, guys.
This is nuts.
Then leave, Stan. Why are you hanging around? Go win a Pulitzer.
Blow me, Delilah,
'cause I'm sick of your shit.
Get the fuck out of here and take your freak dyke with you.
Fuck you, tit bags.
- Will everybody calm down, please?
- All right, Casey.
Let's go alien for a second.
Why here?
Why Ohio?
If you were going to take over the world, would you blow up the White House
Independence Day style... or sneak in through the backdoor?
Casey.
Man, the only person in this school who is an alien... is you, man.
Fuck you, Zeke.
What's going on here?
Shouldn't you people be in class?
Well, it's like this,
Mr Furlong,
Casey here thinks you're an alien.
- Really?
- The whole faculty, actually.
Is that true?
Casey?
The thing I found yesterday...
Where is it?
I sent it to the university.
Do they know what it is?
Look, sorry to impose and disrupt, Mr Furlong, but...
If you'd kindly take your seats, this will be over quite quickly.
Now sit down!
- Put him the fuck down, Furlong.
- This is for the best, Zeke.
Goddamn it!
Come on.
No!
Zeke.
This is usually the point where somebody says, "Let's get the fuck outta here."
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Aliens are taking over the fucking school.
We gotta have proof.
All right, everybody, here's the deal.
We're heading straight for the parking lot.
Pull it together, and try to stay calm.
Stokely.
What's Stan hanging out with those guys for?
Delilah.
My car.
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.
Wait.
Stan!
- There he is. Let's go.
- Where you going, buddy?
- We're going to...
- Come on, Stan. Jesus Christ.
- Get in the fucking car.
- Sure you don't want to play with us?
Nah, Gabe... but thanks.
What the fuck is going on?
Let's see if anybody's talking.
Who the fuck are these guys?
All right, pull over here, fellas.
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey!
- Where's your mom and dad?
- Europe, I think.
Shit.
- My God.
- This is some serious shit.
This is your big secret?
Caffeine pills?
You didn't see that.
What are we gonna do with the police not being an option?
I can call my dad.
He'd know what to do.
If he's even your dad anymore.
It's called a gun, man.
What is it?
We're gonna find out.
Hey, come here, Oscar.
Come here, buddy.
Jeez.
Now what?
I'm sorry, buddy.
See? It's a parasite.
It attaches itself to a host, and then it controls it.
- It's incomplete.
- What do you mean?
It can survive on its own, but it's really part of a greater organism.
Look, it has the ability to replicate, but it needs a host.
Something moist.
See what it did to Oscar's insides.
It dried them out.
Hey, isn't a human body composed mainly of water?
They're using us.
- Drying us out.
- Like Mrs Brummel, right?
I overheard the coach.
Her body was too old.
She didn't take.
See, this partially explains what happened to Furlong.
That drug's a diuretic.
Dries it out. Kills it.
They're using us as hosts. They're just turning us into mindless slaves...
- they can control.
- How do you know that?
She doesn't.
She's a Trekkie sci-fi freak.
Who's been right so far.
How do we stop it?
Yeah, Stokely, this is your area.
In theory, they're all connected.
- If we kill the master, we get them all.
- "In theory."
What happens to everybody else?
The ones who've been taken over?
Do they just die?
No, they don't.
They would become human again.
But that is in theory, so...
So if we found the leader and killed it,
- we'd beat it.
- What are we even talking about?
- I say we get the fuck out of town.
- And go where?
Don't you see? We got to stop it or it's gonna spread.
It took the high school in a day and a half.
Give it a week, we'll never outrun it.
- We have to fight.
- Fight what?
We don't even know who's alien and who's not.
What if one of us was an alien right now? How would we know?
He's right. How do I know you're really Casey?
How do I know you're really you?
In Body Snatchers, humans became emotionless.
- They completely lost their identities.
- The coach had emotion.
I mean, he's usually a real hard-ass, but he was different somehow.
His behaviour was slightly odd.
Like a star quarterback who mysteriously quits the football team?
What are you doing, Delilah?
I'm just pointing out your "slightly odd" behaviour, Stan.
You've been acting really weird the last couple of days.
I'm not an alien,
I'm discontent.
- There's another big word.
- You want to talk slightly odd?
What about you? You haven't been without your contacts... or hair spray since birth.
- I'm incognito.
- We just have to trust each other.
And I'm supposed to trust you? Tell me something,
Miss Lesbian, when did you start liking boys?
- What the fuck you talking about?
- I see the way you look at Stan.
So when did you stop muff-diving?
She's not a lesbian.
That was a hoax.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And what about you,
Miss Atlanta?
It's just really convenient that you showed up the second all these things started happening.
- What are you doing in Ohio anyway?
- It's not my fault.
Hey, shut up.
She's got a point, Zeke.
Yeah, Zeke, Professor.
I mean, you seem to know an awful lot about this stuff.
No offence, but you're not exactly known for your academic achievements.
Neither are you, man.
- Casey, when did you become Sigourney Weaver?
- Wha...
All right, this is getting us nowhere.
I got a solution.
We know this outs them, right?
Take a hit.
No way, man.
I don't do drugs.
Come on, man. If you're not an alien, you got nothing to worry about.
Zeke's right.
This is the only way to know for sure.
Yeah, come on, Stan.
What are you afraid of, man?
Look, we all do it.
- Casey.
- Why me first?
It's your birthright, man.
Just fucking take it.
Easy, boy.
What about you, Zeke? How do we know you're not one of those fucking things?
I don't get high on my own stash, man.
Fuck that, man!
You're taking it.
You're taking it.
Now what the hell's wrong with him?
Nothing's wrong with him, you asshole.
He's tweaking.
Let him fucking tweak!
Tweak. Tweak.
Now you.
Your turn.
Stokely.
I'm not putting that hack drug up my nose.
- It's so '80s.
- Aliens are taking over the Earth. Weigh it.
- What's in it?
- Mostly caffeine. Some other household shit.
Shit.
Now you,
Delilah.
No. Her first.
- I'm allergic.
- Yeah, and I'm Portuguese. Who cares?
Is she always this much fun, man?
Sometimes she can be a real bitch.
You know what I'm saying? You know?
You both take it.
Zeke, I can't.
You know, I can't.
You have to take it.
Showdown.
Del?
Shit!
Shoot her. Shoot her in the head, Casey.
- Stan, I don't know what's happening.
- Shoot her, Casey.
- Don't shoot her, Casey. - Shoot her, Casey.
She's fucking one of them, man!
There's nowhere to go.
Nowhere to hide.
We're everywhere.
I'll fucking shoot her.
Shit!
Jesus!
Get her!
She's getting away!
- Hurry!
- Shit!
I should have known that crazy bitch was one of them.
We can get her back, Zeke.
We can get them all back.
She destroyed most of my supply.
Look, if we kill the queen, we can get them all back.
Fuck!
- How much do we have left?
- Not much.
But we only need enough to get the queen.
- We get her, we get them all, right?
- I think so.
- Where are we gonna find her?
- Friday night? Only one place she can be.
Go Hornets!
He crosses the field!
Eludes the tacklers!
Tackled by four Hornets with authority.
Somebody stung by the Hornets!
Come on, ladies!
Let's play four quarters!
Jesus.
Get in there and take his fucking head off.
Kill! Kill!
Kill!
- You think it's Principal Drake?
- Who else?
She's in charge.
It would make perfect sense.
They're getting everybody.
I mean, the whole town is here.
By morning, there won't be a human left.
Come on.
Where are you guys?
We found Drake.
She's at the game.
What are you kids doing in here?
The gym is closed.
All of you come with me.
We can't do that,
Miss Drake.
Why is that?
Get her.
Quick, Zeke, get the doors!
Get me out!
You're all expelled!
- Stop the act. No one's buying it.
- We know who you are.
You're in a lot of trouble.
What are you doing?
- You ready?
- Yep.
Sniff this.
- No.
- Sniff it or he shoots you.
I will not.
Now what?
We do it the hard way.
With Mr Furlong, we plunged it into his eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.
You stick her, and then I'll shoot her before it erupts all over the place.
Casey, are you on drugs?
- What's wrong?
- Are we sure?
Please don't, Casey!
Don't wuss out, Casey!
Just do it!
What if we were wrong?
Stab it and find out.
I think we made a mistake, guys.
She's dead.
Easy!
Is that it?
Let's see if it worked.
It better have worked, or there are gonna be a lot of infected people going home.
We're right at ground zero.
You guys stay here.
I'll go check it out.
I'm gonna need some scat.
Use it wisely, man.
What if it wasn't Drake?
Then we're fucked.
I just don't want to never have done that.
What are you looking at?
Coach.
Jesus, I wish I'd never come here.
I don't like this place.
Any sign of him?
I can't tell.
I can barely see anything.
Quick, Stokely, open the door.
No, Stokely! We don't know if it's still him.
No, it's me.
Listen, it wasn't Drake.
It's the coach, and he's right after me. Open the door.
Don't do it, Stoke.
Prove it, Stan. Where's the drug?
I lost it. The coach was too fast for me.
Please, Stokely, don't leave me out here.
- Last one, man. - Please, I'm begging you!
Don't leave me out here!
- Come on, Stokely. Open the door.
- There, try it.
Okay, I'll do it. I'll...
Just let me do it inside.
Do it right now, man.
- Take the test, man.
- Stan, take the drug, man. Prove it to us.
Okay.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Open the door.
It is so much better.
There's no fear... or pain.
It's beautiful.
And you will be beautiful.
You'll be beautiful.
No problems or worries.
We want you.
I want you.
I want you.
Now open the fucking door!
- Open the door!
- Come away.
Go a-fucking-way, Stan!
It's too late, Stokely.
We've already won.
No pain, Stan?
Well, come in here, and I'll show you some fucking pain!
I say we go for the coach.
He turned Stan.
He's the one.
Would you rather wait for them to come to us?
Either way, we're completely unarmed.
Maybe not. I might have some more scat.
Where?
- In my trunk.
- In your trunk.
In your car, amongst the aliens.
That's convenient.
You got a better idea?
Stan?
You out there, buddy?
Does it really take two of us to get to your car?
Nope. One of us is a decoy.
Get him!
Where did he go?
- Check over there.
- Come on! Find him!
Hello, Casey.
Where are you gonna go?
Class wuss.
Eternal little loser... who comes to school every day knowing that this is it.
You've been labelled pathetic... since first grade, and you're afraid it's gonna bleed over for the rest of your life.
But we can stop it, Casey.
We can help you belong.
Isn't that what you really want?
Please don't do this,
Delilah.
I haven't been this happy since probably... since before my dad died.
You know you want me, Casey.
Come on.
Let's do it together.
Hello, Miss Burke.
Hello, sweetie pie.
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing important.
So, I take it you changed your mind about the chocolate laxatives?
Actually, I had my heart set on something cherry-flavoured. You know what I mean?
Sorry, I'm all out of those.
I might have something else for you though.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Something tasty?
- Let me hook you up.
Hello, Zekey boy.
You're too tense, honey.
Relax.
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.
I always thought the only alien in this high school was me.
Not the case.
Who do you think it is, the master alien, the queen bee?
It could be anyone.
What happens at the end of these stories, Stokely?
How does Invasion of the
Body Snatchers turn out?
They get us.
They win. We lose.
Do we?
Maybe we really win.
Stan didn't look unhappy.
That's 'cause it wasn't Stan.
They took away who he was.
Maybe they just bettered who he was, cleared away his confusion.
I know you pride yourself on being the outsider, Stokely, but aren't you tired of being something you're not?
I know I am.
No fucking way!
Shit!
Run, Stokes!
Stokes!
Stokely!
Stokes! Stokes!
Stokely!
No!
Stokely!
Come on, Stokes.
Run!
Come on!
- Hello?
- Zeke, I'm over here.
Watch out.
It's her.
- Zeke, don't believe her. It's her.
- She attacked me. Please, Zeke.
- What's going on here, Marybeth?
- Please, it is her.
She's lying.
She's trying to fake you out.
We don't know what she is: gay, straight, alien.
Answer me something,
Marybeth:
Why are you naked?
Does it bother you,
Zeke? My body?
- I'm getting kind of used to it myself.
- But I saw you take the test.
Zeke, how the hell can you be sure what you saw?
It was sweet of you to bond with me.
To be nice to me was sweet.
Will it work again, baby?
Do you like what you see?
Zeke.
- Take this.
- Now, Marybeth.
- You sniff it.
- You're out of your fucking mind.
I'm not taking any chances. I leave for five minutes, and everyone's an alien.
Now if I have to Men In Black your ass, you're gonna fucking sniff it.
Happy now?
Jesus. I'm fucking seeing two of everything.
Zeke. Zeke!
Come on, buddy.
Get up.
He's over here.
Casey, come out, come out, wherever you are.
You know, in my world, Casey, there were limitless oceans as far as the eye could see.
A beautiful home until it started to dry up.
So I escaped, came here and met you.
All of you.
All of you were different from the others.
Thanks, pal.
You were lost and lonely, just like me.
And I thought that maybe
I could give you a taste of my world: a world without anger, without fear, without attitude.
Where the underachiever goes home at night to parents who care.
The jock can be smart, the ugly duckling beautiful, and the class wuss doesn't have to live in terror.
And the new girl... Well, she can just fit right in with people who are just like her.
You see, Casey, even Marybeth's feelings can be hurt... by a bunch of pathetic, lost, little outcasts... who truly believe that their disaffected lonely life... is the only way they can survive.
I can make you a part of something so special, Casey, so perfect, so fearless.
Don't you want that, Casey?
I'd rather be afraid.
Fine. All right.
Have it your way.
'Cause this is where your land of fiction gets it right.
We win.
End of story.
Guaranteed to jack you up.
You wouldn't have liked it here anyway.
Stokes. Stokes.
Are you... you?
I think so.
I hope so.
Fuck!
- Shit!
- Is it over?
Yeah.
All right, you little fuck-pukes, quit screwing around!
As you can see, life has returned to normal at Herrington High... after the mysterious disappearance of several faculty members one month ago.
Both the local authorities and the F.B.I. have largely discounted... several students' claim that an extraterrestrial was involved.
A spokesperson for the F.B.I. has indicated... that no substantiating evidence has been found.
That goes for you too, Zeke!
Just 'cause you're the new guy doesn't mean we're gonna cut you any slack!
Put that butt out and get in there!
Now bring that camera over here.
When do you think they're gonna find a new story?
Haven't they milked our little high school invasion to death?
Although there has been no evidence of foul play, the criminal investigation is ongoing.
No regrets?
None whatsoever.
So, how does it feel to be a hero?
It's all right, I guess.
I don't know, it's...
- different.
- That's him over there. Hey, Casey.
Your fan club's here again.
Network or local?
Both.
You know, you can be pretty cool sometimes.
Things sure have changed, haven't they?
