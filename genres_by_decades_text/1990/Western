They'll fight a delaying action.
Twenty-five, thirty warriors, maybe.
Hundred women and children.
That's it.
The warriors will turn and fight.
-No avoiding that.[br]-No.
It'll give the women and children[br]time to take cover.
One thing for damn sure,[br]they already know we're here.
-Captain Ragsdale![br]-Sir.
Troopers on the flat, form a line!
Company!
-Mr. Ragsdale![br]-Sir!
Advance carbines.
Company! Advance carbines!
-Sound the march.[br]-Bugler!
The Chiricahua Apache[br]from the American Southwest...
...were the last of the great tribes[br]to defy the United States government...
...and its effort to impose[br]the reservation system.
The Army, under the command[br]of Brigadier General George Crook...
...was entrusted with the responsibility[br]of breaking this resistance.
His campaign ended the Chiricahua[br]strongholds below the Mexican border.
Brought to a conclusion the conflict...
...that had raged through the Southwest[br]for nearly two decades.
Tell old Nan and the others[br]we're not going to hurt them.
We're not going anywhere.
We don't want to fight.
We came here to bring you[br]to our reservation.
Tell your men that.
Nantan Lupan only wants peace[br]with the Chiricahua.
Live on the reservation.
Only one Chiricahua warrior[br]and his band of renegades held out.
Then, even he sent word that he would[br]give himself up in two months time.
He was called Goyakla.
But years before, the Mexicans[br]had given him another name:
Geronimo.
One month before my 22nd birthday...
...l reported for duty[br]in the Arizona territory.
It was my first post into garrison life.
In looking back, it is now clear to me[br]that I was as much a stranger to myself...
...as I was to the great western desert.
My name is Britton Davis.
I was a participant in what the Army[br]later called the Geronimo Campaign.
It is my wish to throw some light upon[br]the extraordinary events that I witnessed...
...and on the men that lived them.
The beginning of my life[br]as a frontier soldier was at hand...
...and no amount of military training[br]could disguise the excitement I felt.
-Howdy.[br]-Welcome. It's good to see an army fellow.
Whiskey?
No, thank you, sir.
You don't have to 'sir' me, son.
I ain't no officer.
-Looks like you are, though.[br]-Second Lieutenant Britton Davis.
-At your service.[br]-Proud to know you.
Where you from, Lieutenant?
Born in Texas, near Brownsville.
Texas? Why, hell, son,[br]I thought you was from back east!
Kind of got that manner about you.
Well, I been the last four years[br]at West Point.
-Senor.[br]-Yeah?
Soldados vienen.
My initial impression[br]of First Lieutenant Charles Gatewood...
...remains distinct in my memory.
His brusqueness was entirely military,[br]balanced by unfailing good manners.
In his most matter-of-fact way,[br]he gave me my first order...
...as an officer[br]of the United States Cavalry.
I was to accompany him south.
We were going to bring in Geronimo.
He's due in a few days.
We'Il go on down to the border[br]and escort him to San Carlos.
About 75 miles to the border[br]from here, Mr. Davis.
Plenty of time to get acquainted[br]with your new mount.
-Sir?[br]-Yes?
Just you and me?
The General figured that if we had[br]Geronimo we didn't need much protection.
Yes, sir.
A small detachment means[br]we're not threatening the hostiles.
You wouldn't want to pose a threat[br]to Geronimo, would you?
No, sir.
The Lieutenant was a man of confidence[br]and experience in the Apache wars.
In time I came to realise[br]he was much admired by his peers...
...much respected by his superiors.
That's the border, Mr. Davis.
-How will he find us?[br]-Easy. We're the only ones out here.
Lieutenant?
Apache medicine man.
Probably on a pilgrimage.
The Apaches, they believe in that power.[br]It's a kind of...
...spirit they carry inside them.
Sir, Geronimo's just going to come on in[br]and give himself up?
That's what he promised.
Chiricahua doesn't give his word much,[br]but when he does, he keeps it.
As long as you keep yours.
When the medicine man joined our camp,[br]I was filled with curiosity.
By personal inclination, Lieutenant[br]Gatewood kept his own counsel.
He met questions from an inexperienced[br]officer with patience and courtesy.
What fascinated me most...
...was his sympathy and knowledge[br]of all things pertaining to the Apache.
You don't talk to them much, do you?
To an Apache, stillness is a pleasure.
It's something they're taught[br]while they're young.
Helps someone who may have to[br]hide and wait.
What's he singing about?
Trying to locate Geronimo.
Says he'Il be here tomorrow.
On a white horse.
Superstitious, aren't they?
$5 says he rides in here on a white horse.
Just because the medicine man says so?
You've got a bet, Lieutenant.
Question?
These scouts that we have with us,[br]they're Apache.
Why would they work for the Army?[br]Fight their own kind?
There are lots of different Apache tribes[br]that don't much like each other.
Most of all,[br]Apache go where the best fight is.
It's a morality, once you understand it.
All right, l'Il see your $2...
...and l'Il raise you $1 .
Lieutenant, just curious:[br]are you a family man?
I have a son and a daughter.
They and my wife are back in Virginia.
-You must miss them.[br]-Every hour of every day.
Goyakla is coming.
Rides a white horse.
You owe me $5, Mr. Davis.
I heard you were wearing the blue coat.
I did not believe it.
Now I know your heart.
First Lieutenant Charles P. Gatewood.
It is good to see the great warrior.
You speak pretty good Apache.
Second Lieutenant Britton Davis,[br]Sixth Cavalry.
You are now under the protection[br]of the United States Army.
We will escort you[br]to General Crook at San Carlos.
Nantan Lupan waits for you[br]with an open heart.
They are something.
Chiricahua are special.
Even amongst the Apache.
The second night of our trek to San Carlos,[br]we put up at the Overland way station...
...at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains.
The following morning[br]I had my first opportunity to write home...
...being careful to include in the letter[br]an offhand reference to my participation...
...in the capture of Geronimo.
Two men are coming.[br]Man with white hat carries shotgun.
I'm looking for the officer in charge.
Lieutenant Charles Gatewood[br]at your service.
Heard the Army was travelling through[br]with hostiles.
Especially one hostile in particular.
City Marshal Joe Hawkins, Tombstone.
Apaches over yonder are under arrest.
I'm deputizing you to hold[br]these criminals until we get back...
...with a posse and a warrant.
These Apache are in our custody.
The warrant's going to specify[br]murder of white citizens...
...horse thievery and hostile lndianism.[br]Now, is that good enough for you?
We want to do what's right,[br]which is hang them.
I have orders to turn these Apache in[br]to General Crook.
The United States Army[br]doesn't need your help.
Lieutenant....
Don't sass me, blue coat.
Great Geronimo.
I think you're nothing[br]but a murdering red bastard.
I'd ride on if I were you, sir.
You seem to have provoked the hostiles.
And I don't think you want to get[br]into a contest with the Sixth Cavalry.
Let me tell you something.
Even the Sixth Cavalry is subject[br]to a Federal warrant.
Justice will be served...
...one way or the other.
Toothy.
Get the Apaches going, Mr. Davis.
Now.
Sir.
We moved north with all possible speed...
...but our pack mules prevented us[br]from making good progress.
Around 4:00 in the afternoon,[br]we caught sight of the Tombstone Posse.
Faced with the potential enemy[br]that possessed superior numbers...
...Lieutenant Gatewood hit upon[br]an unusual tactic.
He divided his forces.
He sent me ahead with the others,[br]while he and Geronimo remained behind.
The lieutenant had two objectives.
First, to attempt[br]a rear-guard protective action.
Second, and most important,[br]never to lose sight of Geronimo.
Easy, steady!
What you seeing, Davy?
Looks like some of them split off.
Six or seven of them headed[br]to San Carlos...
...other two up yonder.
That's more of a lynch mob than a posse.
But if they serve those warrants,[br]l'm going to have to give you up.
You have a good long glass, Gatewood.
If I scare them off...
...we trade.
I can't let you kill any of those men.
That was a great shot.
Not so great, I aimed for his head.
We best catch up to Mr. Davis[br]and the others now.
This your name?
Gatewood?
Yes.
A gift from my troops.
They must think you're a fine chief.
No.
Not a chief, just a soldier.
Your glass much better than mine.
Blue stone is valuable to Apache.
Well, thank you.
The following afternoon,[br]we arrived at the military base...
...of operations at San Carlos.
This afforded me my first glimpse[br]of General Crook...
...who the Apache called Nantan Lupan,[br]Grey Wolf Chief.
Our arrival was laid out[br]with great military ceremony.
The surrender of Geronimo[br]was no small event.
General.
My compliments, Lieutenant.
Nantan Lupan.
It does my heart good[br]to see you, Geronimo.
I accept your surrender.
I accept the surrender of a great warrior.
Now, let's have a cup of coffee[br]and smoke a cigar.
Got a lot to talk about.
It's old Geronimo.
Good to see you, ain't it?
You know my friend, AI Sieber.
Yeah. I was always hoping[br]to catch up to you myself, but...
...l guess l'Il never get that chance now.
-Mr. Sieber.[br]-Lieutenant.
I see you have your cigar and coffee.
Lieutenant Gatewood told me[br]of your trip up from the border.
Sounds like quite a story.
I'm glad to see that Geronimo's[br]a man of his word.
Washington's ordered me[br]to detain you here for a short period...
...and then send you and your band[br]of Chiricahua on to Turkey Creek.
We keep our rifles for hunting.
Yes, but only on the reservation.
I'Il put one of my officers in charge there.
Gatewood.
No, l'm sorry, Lieutenant Gatewood[br]is a company officer.
He has his responsibilities here.
Then we take Davis.
I like Davis.
I'm sure Mr. Davis will be a fine officer...
...but I had somebody[br]more experienced in mind.
I like Davis.
-What do you think, Lieutenant?[br]-I'm sure it will be his privilege...
...as well as his duty.
Mr. Davis, it is.
To be accompanied[br]by a small detachment of soldiers.
The Apache will be under the protection[br]of the United States Army.
Mr. Davis is young.
Young Apache, young White-Eye,[br]the hope of the West.
Gatewood.
You come visit me.
I would like that.
I hope the wars are over, my friend.
Nantan Lupan wants the Chiricahua[br]to learn to be farmers.
It's their only chance.
They must change.
The old days are gone.
Nantan Lupan says there must be[br]no leaving this reservation...
...even for a few hours without permission.
There must be no drinking[br]of whiskey or Tizwin.
Any violations of these rules...
...will result in confinement in an Army[br]prison stockade.
He want to know why these rules.
Why they be punished?
What you care if Apache drink?[br]Soldier drink.
Nantan Lupan says[br]if Apache drink, Apache fight.
Apache get into trouble.
It's bad for everyone.
It's bad for the Apache,[br]it's bad for soldiers...
...bad for all the White-Eyes.
Say, why, if some Apache do bad things,[br]all are punished?
That will not happen.
All Apache should not be punished[br]for the mistakes of only a few.
We will determine who is responsible[br]and only those few will be punished.
Six weeks after I took up residence[br]at Turkey Creek, Lieutenant Gatewood...
...and AI Sieber came to visit.
Sieber, as Chief of Scouts, was in charge[br]of recruiting Apache for the Army.
Hello there, Mangas.[br]Just the fellow I want to see.
I want you to join the Army, all right?
Wolves with blue coats,[br]scouts to help us fight the renegades.
You'Il be a sergeant, wear a blue coat,[br]stripes on your coat, with Army pay.
I don't know, Sieber.
Well, you are a warrior. You hunt men.
You'Il make your woman,[br]make your children proud of you.
Mexicans, they took my wife, my little boy.
Maybe the Army could help get them back.
I think maybe I stay here.
If I was asking you out on a raiding party,[br]I expect you'd be a lot more willing.
Federal government had forced[br]over 500 Chiricahua...
...to take up residence[br]within Turkey Creek's narrow borders.
Corn was the main crop, but the land[br]was not fertile enough to be self-sufficient.
The Chiricahua became dependent on[br]government supplies for their well-being.
Gatewood. You come to visit me.
Makes my heart glad to see Geronimo.
How's the life of a farmer?
Some Apaches are good farmer.
Others miss the old way.
I'm not good farmer, Gatewood.
I have come here to visit my friend...
...but I have some questions[br]I need to ask you.
There are rumours that a medicine man[br]is speaking against the White-Eye.
That he is calling for a return[br]to the war trail.
It was told by a medicine man...
...many more Apache would die[br]fighting White-Eye.
And in the end...
...we will win because we will die[br]free of them.
Is the only way for an Apache to be free...
...to die?
Well, which medicine man is this?[br]I should talk to him.
Find out what he's saying.
There are many.
Some have the power.
Some just talk.
He's a warrior.
Every bit born in battle.
Fighting a lost cause.
I'm familiar with the type.
My two older brothers and my father[br]fought for the Army of Northern Virginia.
My oldest brother was killed.
My father was wounded, crippled.
After the war, he took me aside and said,[br]'You'Il carry the new flag.'
Sent me off to the Academy.
First of my family[br]north of the Mason-Dixon line.
So, like our friend,[br]I know what it's like to hate the blue coat.
Before the White-Eye came[br]we had a good life.
Now we are forced to stay[br]on this tiny piece of land.
The White-Eye do not understand[br]the way of the Apache.
The medicine man at Cibecue[br]is called the Dreamer.
He says the dead chiefs will rise.
He says the Apache[br]are the true keepers of the land.
I will go to him.
I want to hear his words.
Today while Gatewood talked with me,[br]I looked into my power.
I saw a white horse running.
I saw signs of war.
Nothing so concentrated[br]the bureaucratic mind...
...in dealing with the lndians as rumours[br]of a troublesome medicine man.
When a religious leader[br]showed up among the tribes...
...preaching doctrines perceived to be[br]dangerous, the government policy...
...was to have the Army[br]deal with it immediately.
I am here by order of General Crook.
Nantan Lupan.
The dead chiefs[br]will not rise if you are here.
The White-Eye must leave.[br]I pray this will happen.
This dance is a demonstration[br]hostile to the citizens of the United States.
And this demonstration[br]is unlawfully assembled.
I order you to stop at this instant!
Stop that!
Stop him! Arrest him!
Watch it!
You didn't have to shoot him, goddamn it![br]I can handle this myself!
-What's he got there?[br]-He had a rock!
He has not done nothing!
We're not bothering no one!
You leave here!
You leave us alone!
Arrest him! Arrest Geronimo!
Where is your heart?
Arrest Geronimo! Arrest him!
-David never really--[br]-General Crook. Telegram, sir.
Pardon me.
Get a staff officer to me immediately.
Captain Ragsdale. Now!
General?
Geronimo's jumped Turkey Creek.
The Apache are out.
It all blew up at Cibecue.
Whole damn thing is a shambles.
Geronimo has taken[br]half of the reservation with him.
Men, women and children.
Spread the word.[br]All officers to their commands.
Yes, sir.
Geronimo had quickly divided[br]his forces into small bands...
...each headed for Mexico.
By the day after Cibecue,[br]Crook had five columns in the field.
The Geronimo Campaign had begun.
On the point!
Circle back!
Sir?
Yes, I see them, Mr. Davis.
Steady in the rank.
Go slow.
Beg your pardon, sir.
Do we attack?
Hold the column.
Sergeant!
Steady in the rank!
Steady!
-Sergeant.[br]-Column halt!
Whatever happens,[br]the Apache will take off.
Don't let the column pursue at speed.
Whenever you can,[br]you choose your ground to fight on.
Chato?
What the hell is going on?
Raiding party, split off from Goyakla.
Apache challenge Gatewood[br]to come out and fight.
Want to show off power[br]to other Chiricahua.
Chato.
Is there anything that should be done?
Geronimo's band had gone east[br]into the copper mining country...
...of the low hills.
His tactics were resupply[br]at the expense of the civilians...
...who had settled on Chiricahua land.
This is Apache land.
This has always been Apache land!
We ain't never done nothing to you.[br]I mean, it ain't right.
Stop crying, damn it!
He's going to kill you anyway.
We make things out of this country!
There was nothing here before us,[br]there'd be nothing if we left it to you.
You are a fool...
...but at least you are brave.
Get off Apache land.
The next time, I will kill you.
Detail halt!
-Troops, right, straight![br]-Left, right, face.
'The Apache known as[br]Dandy Jim and Skip-Hey...
'...have been found guilty by the[br]Military Court, Department of Arizona...
'...of insurrection at Cibecue Creek.
'The Apache Dead Shot...
'...Sergeant, Military Scouts,[br]Sixth Cavalry...
'...been found guilty of treason.
'The sentence of the court[br]for the three prisoners...
'...is death by hanging.'
Do any of you have anything[br]to say to me as Chaplain?
Are any of you Christians?
Nantan Lupan...
...l give you my hat.
Maybe you think my wife, my baby.
Don't trust the White-Eye.
With them there is no right way.
I am not afraid of their preacher.
The One God will welcome me.
There's three of them.
The driver should be nearby.
They didn't have to kill them[br]just to get their horses.
No, they didn't.
AI Sieber had had his wound[br]from Cibecue cauterised with a hot poker...
...and was back in the saddle[br]the following day.
All told, he had suffered[br]17 gunshot and arrow wounds...
...in his many years of fighting Apache.
The General wants to deploy me[br]and Dutchy to your column.
How's that wound, Mr. Sieber?
Which one?
Down here, here, here, here?
Hell, l'm in real good.[br]Ain't slowing me down none.
We came across an overland.[br]Four dead, horses gone.
If they've burned[br]two spreads off to the west...
...they've picked up horses,[br]food, a lot of ammunition.
I figure l'Il just keep tracking off[br]to those hills there.
All right.
Mr. Davis, you and Sergeant Mulrey[br]stick with Mr. Sieber.
Be sure that he gets back[br]to the column by sundown.
Yes, sir.
That raiding party is real close.
Yup.
I want you to ride for the column.
Bring them back to pick up this trail.
On the double, pronto, go on,[br]get out of here!
You take him!
The hostile Apache that Dutchy and I[br]had been pursuing had gotten away.
Needless to say, at the time,[br]I was humiliated.
But much later I decided the incident[br]had come out for the best.
I'm quite content to go to my grave[br]knowing that l've never killed an Apache.
You all right, Mr. Sieber?
Caught up with three bucks[br]and some stolen ponies.
Gave one of them to Mr. Davis.[br]Seems he got away.
Sergeant Mulrey,[br]check the area for a dead hostile!
Sir!
Now, we crossing to Mexico tomorrow?
That's right.
We ought to send some[br]of the scouts back.
I don't trust them south of the border.
Geronimo's got a few of them spooked.[br]They're wondering...
...if they're on the wrong side.
I don't think so, Mr. Sieber.
Besides, we need every scout we have.
Yes, sir.
I guess you weren't there then,[br]when Dead Shot and the others...
...turned on us at Cibecue.
If I had been at Cibecue,[br]they wouldn't have turned.
Whole thing wouldn't have happened, Al.
I know you don't like me much[br]and I don't really care.
I know l'm rough in some of my ways,[br]I guess.
I ain't the gentleman type.
But, I think...
...compared to you, I am somewhat honest.
No offence intended, Lieutenant.[br]Speaking off the record, sir.
I just figure you're a real sad case.
You don't love who you're fighting for...
...and you don't hate[br]who you're fighting against.
Perhaps I could learn to hate[br]with the proper vigour from you, Al.
Well, maybe you could, Lieutenant.
Though I never managed to become[br]a close friend of AI Sieber...
...in the next few weeks of campaigning,[br]I did learn to get along with him.
Only a fool would fail[br]to profit from his vast experience.
In his own way,[br]he was as taken by the Apache...
...as was Lieutenant Gatewood.
Well, sir...
...your Apache rides a horse to death[br]and eats him and steals another.
I mean, the horse is just mobile food.
I've chased them when they made[br]50 miles a day on horse and foot.
Hell, they can live on cactus,[br]go 48 hours without water.
I mean, one week of that would kill[br]your average trooper.
I hear you can track[br]as good as any Apache.
That's right, but there's only one of me[br]and 1,000 square miles of Apache country.
General Crook figured that out, 'cause[br]it takes an Apache to catch an Apache.
White-Eyes can't catch them alone, no sir.
If you ever fight an Apache and things[br]go bad, save the last bullet for yourself.
You don't want to get taken alive, no sir.
They got lots of ways to kill you.
One of their favourites is to strip you,[br]tie you upside down to a wagon wheel.
They pour pitch on you, light you on fire.
I know you are angry about this war.
The White-Eye...
...gave me no choice.
I ask your blessing.
You ask my blessing[br]after this thing is done.
What I did is right.
Now we are fighting[br]Mexicans and White-Eye.
The reservation is bad,[br]but at least we can stay alive.
We have fought the Mexicans for years...
...and the White-Eye will never catch us.
Many Apache will die.[br]I must send for Nantan Lupan.
We will talk with him.[br]I ask that you do this.
General Crook and a small detachment[br]of Apache scouts...
...came across the border[br]into the Canyon de los Embudos.
Crook had agreed to negotiate terms,[br]but he intended a hard bargain.
For the rest of his life, he never forgave[br]Geronimo forjumping Turkey Creek.
Crook maintained his sympathy[br]for the Apache...
...but between he and Geronimo[br]all trust had vanished.
There is one God looking down on us all.
We are all children of one God.
I didn't come here to listen to religion.
You broke your word.
You left Turkey Creek.
You killed many White-Eye.[br]You come back.
Washington wants you to go to Florida.
You do it or l'Il come back[br]with my army and fight.
Nantan Lupan does not understand.
The White-Eye try to change Apache way.
The Apache were doing fine farming corn.
The problem was Geronimo.
I knew Cochise, he was a king.
He was a wise ruler of his people.
I knew Vittorio, he was a proud leader.
And I know Geronimo.
He doesn't want to lead or rule or be wise.
He just wants to fight.
I didn't start this trouble.
The Army killed the Dreamer.
He was calling for war.
If the medicine man had come in[br]peaceably, he'd be alive.
There's no excuse for taking up arms[br]against the United States Army.
The Army's the best friend[br]the Chiricahua ever had.
You know it and I know it.
With all this land,[br]why is there no room for the Apache?
Why does the White-Eye want all land?
How long in Florida?
Maybe two years, with your families.
I think I can get that.
That's not a bad deal.
A lot of White-Eyes want to see[br]Geronimo hanged for murder.
Not murder.
War.
Many bad things happen in war.
How many White-Eye did you kill[br]since you left Turkey Creek?
Maybe 50.
Maybe more.[br]How many Apaches do you kill?
You killed women and children.
So did you.
We gain nothing by fighting.
We can live on the reservation.
I go there.
You, Nantan Lupan...
...are like a brother to me.
Many of my people want to surrender.
When I was young...
...the White-Eye came[br]and wanted the land of my people.
When their soldiers burnt our villages,[br]we moved to the mountains.
When they took our food...
...we ate thorns.
When they killed our children...
...we had more.
We killed all White-Eye that we could.
We starved and we killed...
...but in our hearts...
...we never surrendered.
C.S. Fly, a photographer from Tombstone...
...requested permission[br]to accompany General Crook to Mexico...
...and record the negotiations.
Much to everyone's surprise, Crook agreed.
Even more surprising, Geronimo[br]and the other Chiricahua also agreed.
In some mysterious way, they seemed[br]to understand these pictures...
...would make them immortal.
They are the only known photos[br]ever taken of the American lndian...
...as an enemy in the field.
Old Nana and his people... will return to Turkey Creek.
Many of his people are too old to fight.
Nantan Lupan[br]will make all of you a prisoner.
We have to trust him.
There is no other way.
I called him my brother.
Go if you must. I have made my decision.
I will not surrender to the White-Eye.
I will stay with you and fight.
But now we will be very few.
'Thereby I tender my resignation[br]as commander of this department.
'I have served you well in the past, but my[br]judgment has been called into question.
'Without doubt, I made an error[br]in trusting the word of Geronimo...
'...that he would surrender.
'Perhaps others will be more correct[br]or more fortunate.
'The real tragedy[br]I know you do not understand:
'That is, to the Apache people.
'They have lost in me a true friend...
'...and they have few.
'George Crook,[br]Brigadier General, United States Army.'
I was forced to send this[br]to Washington a day ago.
They've accepted my resignation...
...with regrets.
General Nelson Miles will replace me.
There's nothing to be done, General?
Nothing.
Graceful retirement for a general[br]who could not catch Geronimo.
Settlers, prospectors,[br]land speculators, they won't admit it...
...but the truth is they'd all like to see[br]the lndian dead.
They see the Army as their weapon.
The Army that fight the Apache is[br]the only hope of keeping the Apache alive.
Only the Army can protect them.
Yes, sir.
I fought them a long time, General...
...and I figure if I was one of them,[br]l'd be standing next to Geronimo...
...shooting at the blue coats.
But God made me who I am[br]and between them or us...
...l figure it's us.
Well, damn it, Al.[br]Is that the only way we could win?
Well, I can't answer that question.[br]I'm just a hired hand.
I just want to say,[br]I didn't always agree with you...
...but you had my respect.
And while you was in charge...
...the Army was a proper piece of work.
Sir.
So, l'm going to quit this damn fool job.[br]I'm going to go on down to Tucson and...
...l'm going to get drunk.
Take it easy, Al.
Yes, sir.
Al.
General Miles brought with him[br]an entirely new staff of line officers.
Lieutenant Gatewood,[br]myself and many others...
...had to taste the humiliation[br]of being dismissed from the field.
I'm honoured to be here[br]with you men of the Sixth Cavalry.
Honoured to be here by the order[br]of the President of the United States.
We are charged with bringing in[br]the renegade Apache, Geronimo.
We will accomplish this task.[br]We will succeed.
But we're abandoning[br]certain practices of the past:
Over reliance on Apache scouts.
Men of divided loyalties.
I will keep troops in the field[br]until the enemy is fully subjugated...
...fully pacified.
There will be no compromise[br]with the honour of our nation.
There will be no compromise[br]with the honour of the United States Army.
Captain.
As he had promised,[br]General Miles sent troops forward...
...without the Apache scouts.
For the next five months,[br]they relentlessly searched...
...but the results were predictable.
Geronimo and his tiny band of Chiricahua...
...had vanished deep[br]into the mountains of Mexico.
It seemed they were chasing a spirit[br]more than a man.
Lieutenant.
I doubt if you're enjoying[br]your current assignment.
Nothing personal,[br]I understand you're a fine officer.
Do you know why[br]I called you here, Gatewood?
No, sir.
Tomorrow a new policy change[br]will be announced.
As punishment for Geronimo's resistance.
All Chiricahua living on reservation land[br]are to be rounded up and sent to Florida.
They will stay there[br]until Geronimo is captured or killed.
That's a harsh penalty[br]that he's drawn on his own people.
I hear you and Geronimo were friendly.
Any relationship l've had has never[br]compromised my effectiveness in the field.
I need you to speak freely with me.
Can you find Geronimo, talk to him?
I thought so once.
There's no way to be sure now.
The signs are that he's starving,[br]or close to it.
Living on cactus and rabbits.
I know this because l've got[br]observation points...
...and 5,000 troops[br]stretched from here to Sonora...
...searching for--
Thirty-five Apache, sir.
That's what I believe he'Il be down to[br]in a month's time.
Thirty-five starving Apache.
Begging the General's pardon, sir,[br]but why not leave him to the Mexicans?
He can't continue to keep raiding[br]across the border.
He can't afford to lose any more warriors,[br]can't replace them.
The present political situation[br]demands results.
I want you to find Geronimo[br]and make him this proposal.
I have the authority to hunt him[br]all the way to South America if I have to...
...but I want this nonsense to end.
Now, l'm willing to give you[br]all the scouts you need...
...hundred-man detail, regular cavalry,[br]mule pack team.
A hundred men won't do.
How many do you want?
Three.
I'd like to pick them myself.
Whatever happens, Lieutenant...
...this conversation that you and I[br]are having never took place.
Any negotiations with Geronimo[br]are to be strictly confidential.
Is that understood?
Two years in Florida.
Two years in Florida, with their families.
And when they return to reservation land[br]here in Arizona territory...
...every warrior gets 40 acres of land...
...two mules.
I don't think you or the government[br]intend to keep this promise.
You just offer it.[br]None of the rest is your concern.
Do you know your scripture, sir?
'What does it profit a man[br]to gain the whole world...
'...and lose his soul?'
Lieutenant.
You have your orders.
Lieutenant Gatewood chose the Apache[br]scout, Chato, to accompany him...
...as well as myself and AI Sieber,[br]who became bored with his retirement.
After four weeks of tracking Geronimo[br]through the mountains of Sonora...
...we came across a burning lndian village.
What we found there was unspeakable.
There's two dead women there.
Two little kids.
Scalped them all, all four of them.
Bounty hunters.
Government down here pays[br]200 pesos a head for the men.
100 for the women...
...and 50 for those kids.
Kill any lndian, then claim they're Apache.
I don't see how any man can sink that low.
Must be Texans,[br]lowest form of white man there is.
Who are these people?
They are Yaqui, not Apache.
The dying Yaqui told me[br]five White-Eye and a Comanche...
They attacked before dawn.
Most of the men got away.
They go up into the hills...
...and come back one day, maybe two.
And come back for their families.
And build big fire and burn the bodies.
And they go join up[br]with other Yaqui tribe...
...maybe find new wives.
They go off that way into the hills.
After they hunt Yaqui men[br]they go to Soyapos...
...get their money.
You and Sieber, I want you to track[br]the bounty hunters that did this.
Geronimo is here.
You want me to ride? l'm ready--
You need more rest...
The women have gathered medicine.
Do we leave at dawn?
Don't worry.
We will not fight tomorrow.
Sleep.
I have just seen my power.[br]An iron horse comes over the desert.
I have seen a vision.[br]An iron horse for the Apache.
Been down here...
...almost 20 years.
I was in the war.
Confederate officer.
After the hostilities ended...
...l went to Texas.
Got into a little scrape with the law.
Come down here, got a new name.
New start.
Wife.
Family.
But in my heart...
...well, hell...
...l'm still a Tennessee man.
My wife and her sisters...
...they trade with Apache women.
They come down from the mountains.
They've done it for years.
Few days back,[br]some Chiricahua showed up near here.
Where?
Straight up Montana Avarripe.
I didn't expect to see[br]many Americans down here.
-Where you fellows from?[br]-Texas.
I keep a house in Brewster county.
Awful far from home, ain't you?
Well, we just came down here[br]to try to make ourselves a living.
And what about you, friend?
It seems like you've got[br]a real curious nature.
-You the law?[br]-Me? Hell, no.
I'm just hunting[br]that son of a bitch Geronimo.
Thought you might've come across[br]something to help me out.
I'm sorry, amigo.
We ain't seen nothing.
Apache!
Why don't you sit down there,[br]while we have us a drink.
We'Il take real good care of you.
Cover my back.
Anything happens, fire.
And keep firing.
Sir.
That Apache is with us.
Don't look like it to me.
He's a Sergeant of Scouts...
...in the United States Army.
Who the hell are you?
Charles Gatewood.
Lieutenant, Sixth Cavalry.
You boys are out of uniform.
Maybe he ought to wear one.
Somebody down here[br]take that scalp of his...
...make themselves a little money.
Ten days ago,[br]we came across a Yaqui village.
All the lndians slaughtered.
We come across[br]the same type of thing a while back.
I tell you, this is a crazy country.
...buys that scalp back.
Nice doing business with you,[br]Mr. Gatewood.
But...
...l changed my mind.
You rotten son of a bitch.
Amigo.
Move it, Dixie boy.
Goddamn.
I never thought l'd get killed[br]trying to help save an Apache.
We got them, Mr. Sieber.
We got them all.
I've been gun-shot, arrow-shot 17 times.
Twenty years chasing old Geronimo.
I'd love nothing better[br]than being there to...
...finish.
You don't have to[br]account yourself to me, Al.
You're a brave man.
I never did have no kind of luck.
Never did.
I'm going to catch me[br]a little sleep here for...
...a minute or two.
Rotten sons of bitches.
Gatewood!
No more burro!
Can't go higher!
Chato and l...
...are going on here alone.
You stay with the supplies.
Sir.
Are you giving me a choice?
That's an order, Lieutenant.
I know it's hard to come this far then stop,[br]and l'm sorry.
But somebody's got to go back[br]and tell the truth.
Britton...
...you're a fine officer.
Stay noble.
We're trying to make a country here.
It's hard.
Why did you bring him?
He is an enemy to his people!
He thinks you are.
He is a brave man to come here.[br]Enough Chiricahua are dead.
They are dead[br]because the White-Eye killed them.
Have they taught you to lie, Gatewood?
I don't lie.
But the truth is, General Miles[br]will hunt you for 50 years.
He's already sent your families to Florida,[br]which is far, far away.
Look around.
See how few warriors you have left.
If I kill White-Eyes forever...
...l am still Geronimo, an Apache.
Who are you, Gatewood?
Just a man like you.
And I want to go home.
I want to see my family.
My God....
My God is a God of peace.
A God of life, not death.
What does your God say?
Yosin is not here with us on the mountain.
Tell me, what is in your heart?
The war is over.
I offer this...
...because it has power for me.
Our fight must end here.
When I was young, I took a wife.
We lived in these mountains.
We have our family.
The Mexican soldiers came[br]and they killed her.
They killed her and my two little girls.
They killed them because we are Apache.
I remember when I found their bodies.
I stood until much time had passed,[br]not knowing what to do.
I had no weapon...
...but I did not want to fight.
I did not pray.
I did not do anything.
I had no purpose left.
After a year had passed...
...my power showed me[br]how to get revenge.
And always, since then, I get revenge.
But no matter how many I kill...
...l could not bring back my family.
Yosin...
...the Apache God, is a God of peace.
I gave you the blue stone.
You give me this.
It will be peace.
On September 4, 1886...
...Geronimo and 34 Chiricahua men,[br]women and children...
...surrendered to General Nelson Miles.
As he handed over his weapons,[br]Geronimo simply said:
'Once I moved about like the wind.[br]Now I surrender and that is all. '
He refused any further conversation[br]with the General.
After arranging Geronimo's[br]final surrender...
...Lieutenant Gatewood was transferred[br]to a remote garrison in Northern Wyoming.
His continued presence would have been[br]an embarrassing reminder...
...that the United States Army had failed[br]to defeat a band of 35 Apache.
Instead of being rewarded with a medal[br]for his heroic efforts...
...Lieutenant Charles Gatewood[br]was sentenced to obscurity.
Sir, formation is ready.
Attention!
-Prepare to mount![br]-Present arms!
Mount!
Detail, arms, halt!
'By order of the office[br]of the President of the United States...
'...all Chiricahua scouts are under arrest...
'...and will be transported[br]to Fort Marion Prison...
'...Saint Augustine, Florida...
'...with the outlaw Apaches,[br]led by Goyakla, known as Geronimo!
'The Apache scouts[br]from the White Mountain...
'...Coyotero and Mescalero tribes[br]are to return at once...
'...to their reservations.
'They will remain within these boundaries[br]unless given express permission to travel.
'Their duties for the United States Army[br]are at an end.
'We thank them for their services.'
Detail!
Collect arms!
I'm a good Apache, it's not right.
I'm Sergeant Chato, a scout.
Later that afternoon,[br]Geronimo, his band of renegades...
...and all the Chiricahua[br]that had served the Army so faithfully...
...were loaded into wagons and transported[br]to the railhead at Holbrook.
There, they were to begin theirjourney[br]to Florida and imprisonment.
Halt!
Morning report, sir.
Mr. Glenville, l'd like to see the General.
On what business?
It's about Mr. Gatewood.
Sir.
I thought the US Army kept its word.
I thought maybe[br]we were the only ones left who did.
What's going on out there is a disgrace.
Lieutenant.
You're more worried[br]about keeping your word to a savage...
...than you are fulfilling your duties[br]to the citizens of this country.
We won. That's what matters.
It's over, Lieutenant.
Geronimo, the Apache, the whole history[br]of the West, except being a farmer.
Mr. Gatewood wouldn't want me[br]to be a part of any of this.
I hate an idealist.
There's always something messy[br]about them.
I'm ashamed.
And you have my resignation.
To the disappointment[br]of family and friends...
...l had ended my military career.
Over the years, the events[br]surrounding the Geronimo Campaign...
...have continued to haunt me.
I carry the memory of those days...
...days of bravery and cruelty...
...of heroism and deceit.
And I am still faced with[br]an undeniable truth:
A way of life that endured[br]a thousand years was gone.
This desert...
...this land that we look out on...
...would never be the same.
You were right to fight the White-Eye.
Everything they said to me was a lie.
You helped them...
I will hate you forever.
There are so few of us left...
We should not hate each other.
She has the coughing sickness.
She will die soon.
Maybe the baby, too.
No one knows why the One God[br]let the White-Eye take our land.
Why did there have to be[br]so many of them?
Why did they have so many guns,[br]so many horses?
For many years,[br]the One God made me a warrior.
No gun, no bullets, could ever kill me.
That was my power...
Now my time is over.
Now, maybe, the time[br]of our people is over.
Geronimo lived for another 22 years...
...as a prisoner of war.
Despite its promise...
...the federal government[br]never let him return home.

TESTIFY AGAINST WHO?
AGAINST THE MURPHY BOYS
HE'S GOT IN THAT PIT
IN LINCOLN.
YOU CAN HANG
YOUR OLD ENEMIES, KID.
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE

HMM.
HEY. PAULITA MAXWELL

WHOA! CELSA BACA!
YOU GOT TO BEAR GREASE
THE DAMN WALLS
TO GET THAT PIG

YEAH? THAT'S THE ONLY THING
WE'D HAVE TO BEAR GREASE.
GARRETT!
WELL, GARRETT WAS RIGHT.
I WAS RUNNING OUT
OF PLACES TO HIDE.
AND HERE WAS
GOVERNOR LEW WALLACE,
THE SECOND BEST-KNOWN MAN
IN NEW MEXICO,
PROPOSING TO MAKE A TREATY
WITH ME IN LINCOLN.
THEN WHY GIVE UP THE SANCTUARY
OF A LITTLE VILLAGE
WHERE I WAS PROTECTED
BY MY FRIENDS?
BUENOS DIAS, IGNIO.
#COMO ESTAS?
HOLA, BILLY.

[GUNSHOTS]

YOUR EXCELLENCY...
IT'S HIM.
HE'S HERE.
WELL, SHOW HIM IN.
HI.
MR. BONNEY?
I APPRECIATE
YOUR GOOD FAITH.
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M GOVERNOR LEW WALLACE.
EXTRAORDINARY.
I WAS EXPECTING A RATHER ROUGH
AND OLDER FELLOW,
NOT SO SMOOTH OF FACE.
COGNAC, MR. BONNEY?
UH-UH.
WELL, THEN. TO THE POINT.
THE VARIOUS CRIMES COMMITTED
DURING THE LINCOLN CATTLE WAR--
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
IT WAS NO CATTLE WAR.
IT WAS A MERCHANT WAR,
IRISH AGAINST THE ENGLISH.
THEY KILLED MY EMPLOYER,
MR. TUNSTALL,
AND I MADE WAR.
THOSE MEN THAT KILLED
YOUR EMPLOYER,
THE GROUP THAT EVADED
THE REVENGE
OF YOUR SO-CALLED
REGULATORS,
THEY'VE BECOME
A RATHER ROUGH BUNCH
SINCE THIS MERCHANTS' WAR,
CUTTING
PROMINENT RANCHERS' HERDS
LIKE JOHN CHISUM'S.
YES, SIR. THEY HAVE.
AND YOU HAVE, TOO.
HOWEVER...
YOU'RE ONE,
AND THE MURPHY-DOLAN RUSTLERS
ARE MANY.
IF YOU CAN TESTIFY
AGAINST WHAT YOU SAW
IN YOUR LITTLE WAR,
I CAN THEN ELIMINATE
THE MANY.
WELL...
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE?
MY TERMS ARE SIMPLE--
YOUR TESTIMONY AGAINST THOSE
WHO MURDERED YOUR EMPLOYER
IN EXCHANGE FOR LENIENCY.
NO.
MY TESTIMONY IN EXCHANGE
FOR A FULL PARDON.
WELL,
I'M AFRAID THAT'S--
I TESTIFY,
AND I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN
A FREE MAN.
IF NOT,
I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN NOW.
ANY OF YOUR BOYS
TRY TO FOLLOW ME,
THEY'LL WIND UP
IN A PINE BOX.
IF YOU
WERE GIVEN PARDON,
YOU WOULD LEAVE
NEW MEXICO,
NEVER TO RETURN?
YOU GO ON THE STAND
AND HELP ME HANG
15 RUSTLERS,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
PARDON.
HA HA HA HA!
OF COURSE,
15 MINUTES LATER,
THE MURPHY BOYS WILL SHOOT YOU
DEAD AS A MANGY DOG
IN THE STREET.
SO WE'LL ARREST YOU,
A STAGED ARREST
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION
BEFORE THE TRIAL.
BUT THAT'S FOR YOU
TO DECIDE.
CAN I HAVE
SOME OF THAT CAKE?
PENDLETON.
UH-UH, PENDLETON.
UH-UH.
THE, UH...
THE WHITE CAKE
WITH THE SWEET FROST.
SO...
SHALL WE PROCLAIM
OUR SECRET PARLEY
A SUCCESS?
IT'S A DEAL.
WHEN THE NECK IS BROKEN,
THERE'S ONLY A SHARP PAIN, FAST.
THEN IF THE OTHER PLACE
ACCEPTS YOU,
THE SPIRIT HORSE COMES.
IT TAKES YOU THERE
TO THE OTHER SIDE.
SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH.
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE SPIRIT HORSE.
SHE'LL COME FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND.
GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, CHAVEZ.
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO CATCH
A SPIRIT HORSE.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE
THE OTHER SIDE.
I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANNA
HAVE MY NECK BROKE
THROUGH A SHARP, QUICK PAIN.
THE ONLY THING
I REALLY WANT TO DO
IS GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.
ME, TOO.
[APPLAUSE]
WELL DONE, WILLIAM.
SPLENDID PERFORMANCE.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE
THREE CANDLES LEFT
AND ONLY TWO BULLETS.
[GUNSHOT]
SPLENDID, SPLENDID!
WHAT DID I SAY?
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
MR. BONNEY...
DISTRICT ATTORNEY RYNERSON'S
HERE TO SEE YOU.
THE GOVERNOR
THINKS IT'S BEST
IF YOU HAVE
YOUR RESTRAINTS ON.
HEY, SHERIFF?
CAN YOU BRING THAT
FIDDLE PLAYER IN AGAIN?
HE WAS QUITE GOOD.
HOW ABOUT SOME MORE CAKE
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE?
AND IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE NIPPY IN HERE.
COULD YOU STOKE UP
THAT FIRE?
THANKS, GEORGE.
YES, SIR.
I WAS STARTING TO GROW FOND
OF PRISON LIFE.
TOP OF THE MORNING
TO YOU, MR. BONNEY.
FINALLY IN CHAINS,
ARE YOU?
STILL TRYING TO
KEEP UP YOUR GAME?
WELL,
WE'LL BE SEEING YOU
ON THE FLOOR
OF THE COURTS VERY SOON.
I AIN'T BEING TRIED.
I'M TESTIFYING AGAINST DOLAN
AND ALL THE OTHER SWINE
WHO KILLED MY FRIEND
JOHN TUNSTALL. YES, SIR.
ARE THE BLOODY COCKS
STILL RUNNING THE COOP?
AH, TO BE SURE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HA HA HA!
HMM.
WHO GIVES TESTIMONY
IS STRICTLY
WITHIN THE DISCRETION
OF THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY,
WHO HAPPENS TO BE ME,
WHO HAPPENS TO THINK
NOT A BLOODY CHANCE
IN THE PIT OF HADES.
UGH!
YOU CAN'T BLUFF ME.
NO.
I'LL CHARGE YOU,
SENTENCE YOU.
I WILLHANG YOU...
BUT I'D NEVER
BLUFF YOU.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
THE GOVERNOR'S ON HIS WAY
BACK TO SANTA FE NOW.
PARDON BILLY THE KID!
IMPOSSIBLE!
I SHOULD HAVE DUSTED
HIS EXCELLENCY'S REGAL ASS
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.
HE DIDN'T EXACTLY
LIE TO ME.
HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER
AGAINST THE IRISH POLITICIANS
WHO WERE STILL RUNNING
LINCOLN COUNTY.
GOOD DAY, MR. BONNEY.
GOOD DAY, MR. DUNG PILE.
HA HA HA!
AIN'T THAT A BEAUT?
HA HA HA!
ANOTHER HISTORICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL FACT
WAS THAT
I HAD SMALL HANDS
AND BIG WRISTS.
AND THAT HAS SAVED MY LIFE
MORE TIMES
THAN COLONEL COLT'S EQUALIZER.
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING
NEAR TO SUPPER TIME.
YOU BOYS HUNGRY?
I GOT TWO LOTS
OF NEWS FOR YOU--
GOOD AND BAD.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE BAD NEWS FIRST.
ALL WE GOT FOR SUPPER
IS HORSESHIT.
HA HA HA HA!
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE GOOD NEWS?
Scurlock:
THERE'S TONS OF IT.
THE WORLD HATES
A SMART MOUTH, SCURLOCK.
OF COURSE, YOU'RE GOING
TO REALIZE THAT TOMORROW
WHEN YOU SWING
FROM THAT GALLOWS.
HEE HEE!
THAT'S IF THE LYNCH MOB
DON'T COME FOR YOU FIRST,
WHICH I HEAR TELL
THEY INTEND TO DO.
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU BOYS WANT SOME DESSERT.
HA HA HA HA!
[WOMAN LAUGHING]
HOWDY, BELL.
EVENING.
HOWDY, BOYS.
HEE HEE HEE!
IF THEY STICK THEIR
FINGERS UP AGAIN,
I'LL BLOW THEM OFF
LIKE I DID YOURS,
EH, MOFFAT?
IF THERE WAS ONE THING
AN OUTLAW FEARED
IN THE NEW MEXICO TERRITORY,
IT WAS LYNCH-MOB JUSTICE.
RIGHT ON TIME.
WITH NO PATIENCE FOR COURTS
AND TRIALS,
THEY DID IT
THEIR OWN WAY,
AND THERE
WAS NO STOPPING THEM,
MAINLY 'CAUSE
THE SO-CALLED LAW...
HOWDY.
HAD NO DAMN INTENTIONS
OF STOPPING THEM.
YOU'RE A BIT LATE.
VIGILANTES!
JEEZ! IT'S THE LYNCH MOB!
KID'S ESCAPED,
THE LITTLE WEASEL.
OH, I'M SURE HE DID,
MISTER.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
OPEN THE PIT.
GET OUT OF THE WAY!
NO BILLY THE KID
IN THERE.
IT'S TRUE! HE'S GONE!
WE MIGHT
AS WELL GO.
WE GOT SOME OF HIS
REGULATORS THERE--
THE INDIAN
AND TENDERFOOT
RODE WITH THE KID
ON THE TUNSTALL-
McSWEEN SIDE.
HOW'D THEY BE?
AW, SHIT.
THEY'LL HAVE TO DO.
BRING THEM UP.
[YELLING]
HA HA HA HA!
PICK YOUR TREE, BREED.
STOP!
I ORDER YOU AS A PEACE OFFICER
OF LINCOLN COUNTY!
HA HA HA HA!
GENTLEMEN, I'M A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK,
AND THE BREED BACK THERE,
WELL, HE'S MY GUIDE,
AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO MAKE AN ENORMOUS ERROR.
WE KNOW YOU RODE
WITH THE BOY- DEVIL,
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HANG FOR IT.
I SWEAR TO YOU. I NEVER
EVEN LAID EYES ON HIM.
I WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK!
"I'M A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM THE ClTY OF NEW YORK!"
HA HA HA!
HOWDY, DOC.
HOW ARE YOUR DRAWERS?
NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, BILLY.
IT'S THE KID!
COME ON!
LET'S GET OUT!
JESUS! YOU SURE GOT
A LOT OF BOYS
RIDING WITH YOU
THESE DAYS.

AH!
HEY! HEY!

[GUNSHOTS]
HOLD STILL NOW.

IN MY ELBOW.
MAKES MY RIGHT ARM
KIND OF...WHOA!
HOLD STILL NOW.
IAMSTILL.
JUST SHOOT
THE CHAIN, OK?
GOD DAMN.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, DOC.
I KNEW
YOU'D COME BACK.
WE MADE A PACT,
REMEMBER?
YOU, ME, AND CHAVEZ.
PALS FOREVER.
BILLY,
THE CHAINS.
LOOK. I DON'T CARE
IF YOU GUYS
SWAPPED SPITTLE AND PISSED
IN EACH OTHER'S BOOTS.
I DON'T TAKE TO TENDERFOOTS
IN MY GANG,
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T TAKE
TO NO MEXICANS.
IT AIN'T YOUR GANG,
DAVE.
MEXICAN-INDIAN,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
OH! I'M SORRY!
HEY, TELL ME SOMETHING,
CHAVEZ.
WAS IT THE SAVAGES PUTTING IT
TO A MEXICAN WHORE,
OR WAS IT AN INDIAN WHORE
PUTTING IT TO
THE WHOLE GOD DAMN MEXICAN ARMY?
HO, HO, HO!
GOD DAMN IT.
REMEMBER SOMETHING,
DAVE.
THESE BOYS
ARE THE LINCOLN COUNTY
REGULATORS.
YEAH. WAS.
WERE.
BILLY, COME ON.
THE CHAIN.
YOU'RE RIGHT, DOC.
WERE.
THERE AIN'T NO REGULATORS
NO MORE.
NO ROOM FOR THEM.
NO ROOM FOR ME.
BILLY, PLEASE.
I'M TAKING
THE MEXICAN BLACKBIRD.
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING?
THE BROKEN TRAIL
THAT GO DOWN TO OLD MEXICO.
ONLY ME AND A FEW OTHER BOYS
KNOW IT.
TAKE THE TRAIL BELOW.
HEY, DOC...
ONCE YOU'RE DOWN THERE,
THESE BASKET MEN,
PAY THEM,
AND THEY'LL COME UP
AND GET YOUR BELONGINGS,
YOUR FAMILY,
WHATEVER YOU NEED.
COME HERE, BILLY.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHOOT THE CHAIN, OK?
ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN HERE.
MOUNT UP.
WE'RE TAKING
THE MEXICAN BLACKBIRD, HUH?
OLD MEXICO. LET'S GO.
COME ON.
WHERE'D
YOU FIND HIM?
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S FROM NEW YORK.
IT'S FOR THE HORSE.
THAT HORSE
AIN'T FOR SALE, DOC,
BUT, UH...
HOW ABOUT MY BOOTS?
THEY'RE NICE
AND BROKE AND--
SON OF A BITCH!
WOO HOO HOO!
COME ON, BILLY.
KILL THAT TENDERFOOT
SON OF A BITCH!
GET ON TOP OF HIM!
COME ON!
COME ON. BREAK IT UP, BILLY!
I KNOW YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU KNOW ME, HUH?
WELL, I KNOW YOU!
YOU KILLED HALF THE MEN
I GOT CREDIT FOR.
I SAW YOU WITH BLOOD
ALL OVER YOURSELF.
I SAW YOU KILL!
JUST BECAUSE YOU WENT
BACK EAST AND MARRIED,
PUT ON A SILK CRAVAT,
THAT DON'T CHANGE
WHAT YOU DID!
DAMN IT, CHAVEZ!
LET ME HAVE--
YOU REMEMBER
JOHN TUNSTALL?
REMEMBER THE STORIES
HE'D TELL US
ABOUT THE THREE CHINAMEN
PLAYING FAN-TAN?
SOMEONE RUNS UP TO THEM
AND SAYS, "HEY!
THE WORLD lS COMlNG
TO AN END."
AND THE FIRST ONE SAYS,
"WELL, I BEST GO
TO THE MlSSlON AND PRAY."
AND THE SECOND ONE SAYS,
"WELL, HELL!
I'M GOlNG TO GO BUY ME A CASE
OF MESCAL AND SlX WHORES."
AND THE THlRD ONE SAYS,
"WELL, I SHALL FlNlSH THE GAME."
I SHALL FINISH THE GAME, DOC.
WHOEVER'S GOING FOR OLD MEXICO,
WE RIDE NOW.
JOSIAH, THIS AIN'T
THE UNTAMED PRAIRIE
YOU USED TO
RUN FREE OVER.
I GOT A FAMILY
I GOT TO GET BACK TO, PAT.
THE NEW GOVERNOR WAS
THE GENERAL AT SHILOH...
HE'S GOT MILITIA,
HE'S GOT ARMY,
HE'S GOT MONEY
TO PAY GLORY HUNTERS
TO RUN YOU
DAY AND NIGHT,
AND THEY'RE
ON THEIR WAY,
AND THEY WILL
KILL YOU, DOC.
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, PAT.
THEY'LL
CATCH YOU, DOC,
AND CATCH ME.
EVERYBODY BUT HIM.
THE VILLAGERS SAY
HE'S ADIABLERO.
HE CAN CHANGE
INTO A COYOTE,
DISAPPEAR, AND NEVER
GETS KILLED.
ME?
I JUST THINK
HE'S THE LUCKIEST
WHITE EYE IN NEW MEXICO.
BUT HE'LL CROSS
THE BORDER.
HE WILL.
CHAVEZ, I CAN'T RIDE
WITH HIM ANYMORE.
TRYING TO SPEND THE LAST YEAR
FORGETTING ABOUT HIM.
READ ABOUT HIM
IN THE NEWSPAPER
AND THEM DAMN
FIVE- CENT BOOKS.
JESUS CHRIST,
THE CHILDREN
IN NEW YORK CITY
IMITATE HIM
IN THE STREETS.
HE'S IN MY SLEEP.
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING.
IT'S OVER.
WHEN THE SPIRIT HORSE COMES,
THEN IT'S OVER.
WELL, CHAVEZ KNEW
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
HE HAD SEEN THE SOLDIERS
MURDER HIS ENTIRE FAMILY,
AND HE'D BEEN HUNTED DOWN
LIKE A DOG
AND THROWN IN THE PIT.
HE KNEW HIS ONLY CHANCE
WAS TO SKIN OUT
AND HEAD SOUTH.
YAH! YAH!
BUT DOC,
HE DID HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
TO GO BACK TO,
AND ALTHOUGH HIM AND ME
WERE LIKE BROTHERS
AND HE REALLY WANTED TO
RIDE WITH ME,
HE JUST NEEDED SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.
OH, NO.
OK, READY?
GRAB A HOLD.
LIFT HIM UP.
[PRAYING IN LATIN]
WHERE'S THE HAMMER?
LUKE,
GIVE US A HAND.
THAT'S IT.
GOT IT?
WHERE ARE WE GONNA
PUT THIS?
WE WANT HIS HEAD.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
SHERIFF KIMBEL?
I WANT YOU
TO GET ON YOUR HORSE,
AND I WANT YOU TO TRACK
THIS LITTLE FIEND
TO THE EDGE
OF THE EARTH.
I WANT YOU TO
ASSASSINATE HIM.
I WANT YOU TO DELIVER
HIS HEAD IN BURLAP!
I'D RATHER DRINK TURPENTINE
AND PISS ON A BRUSH FIRE.
I AIN'T
TOUCHIN' THIS ONE.
BILLY,
WHERE ARE THE MEN
YOU PROMISED US?
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD AN ARMY.
I DO.
HERE IT COMES.
JESUS...JUST ONE?
THAT'S ALL
YOU COULD FIND?
NO ONE
WANT TO COME.
EVERYONE AFRAID.
ARE YOU
A FARMER?
YES, SIR.
MY NAME'S
HENDRY WILLIAM FRENCH.
YOU EVER SHOOT
ANYBODY BEFORE,
HENDRY WILLIAM
FRENCH?
YOU EVER SHOOT
ANYTHING BEFORE?
SAGE HEN.
SAGE HEN!
AHH...
WELL, TELL ME
SOMETHING, HENDRY.
WHY IS IT YOU WANNA
JOIN MY GANG, HUH?
WELL, I AIN'T--
I AIN'T A FARMER
NO MORE.
UH...LOST MY WIFE
TO THE POX,
LOST MY LAND
TO THE MONEY MEN.
HEY, BIG CASINO...
WHY DON'T YOU SAW A FOOT
OFF OF THIS THING
IN CASE WE RUN INTO
GOVERNOR WALLACE ON THE WAY.
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
MAKE THIS ONE, KID.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU GOTTA COME WITH US, PAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
STAY HERE
AND SCRUB POTS FOR BEEVER?
I MAY HAVE OLD BEEVER
SCRUB THE POTS FOR ME.
I'M BUYING THIS PLACE,
TURNING IT
INTO AN EATING HOUSE.
THERE'S WILDCAT MONEY
COMING IN HERE.
I GOT TO STAKE MY PIECE
WHILE I STILL GOT
A FAIR ENOUGH NAME.
WHAT NAME?
YOU'D BE RIDING
WITH KNOWN MEN, PATSY.
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A KNOWN MAN IN NEW MEXICO.
HELL,
I'LL BE A KNOWN MAN.
NEXT TIME
YOU RIDE THROUGH HERE,
THERE'LL BE
A BIG OLD SIGN OUT THERE
SAYS "GARRETT'S PLACE."
IT'S TIME
I GOT AN INCOME
THAT AIN'T
FROM STEALING HORSES.
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
SOMETHING, PAT.
I NEVER STOLE A HORSE
FROM SOMEONE I DIDN'T LIKE.
IF I DIDN'T LIKE THEM,
I JUST WOULDN'T
EVEN BOTHER WITH THEM.
NO. HE'D JUST KILL THEM.
HEY, COME ON, PAT!
YOU'RE ONE OF US!
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN ONE OF US!
I ALWAYS WILL BE, BILLY.
WELL, GO ON, THEN!
GO ON!
WE DON'T NEED YOU, PAT!
WE DON'T NEED HIM.
AH!
SOAPWEED, I GOT YOU!
YOU WANT TO EAT
OUT OF MY ASHCANS?
GO ON. HAVE A CHEW!
GO ON! GO ON!
HOWDY, BEEVER.
GO ON.
SIT WITH THE BOYS.
WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?
THIS?
THIS IS THE PRINCE
OF PENNSYLVANIA.
MMM, MMM, MMM.
[SIGHS]
[CLANGING]
THE FIRST STOP
ALONG THE BLACKBIRD
WAS TO RAISE SOMEDINEROS,
AND JOHN SIMPSUM CHISUM
WAS THE RICHEST MAN
IN THE TERRITORY.
NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT AS ANYONE FAMILIAR
WITH THE LINCOLN WAR KNOWS,
HE WAS A FINANCIAL PARTNER
OF TUNSTALL AND McSWEEN,
WHICH MADE HIM AN ALLY.
OLD JOHN
ADMIRED MY PLUCK
AND LOVED ME
LIKE I WAS HIS OWN SON.
WELL, BY GOD.
YOU REALLY TURNED OUT
TO BE A SNAKE, BILLY.
WHEN THEY CATCH YOU,
THEY'RE GONNA DRY GULCH
YOUR STINKING BONES.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
MY FRIENDS TO OLD MEXICO.
WE NEED SOME PESOS.
NOW, I'VE DONE
SOME FIGURING,
AND I FIGURE YOU OWE US,
MR. CHISUM--
$25O FOR THE FIGHTING
WE DID LAST YEAR
AND $25O FOR ME
LEAVING YOUR STOCK ALONE.
IS THAT
WHAT YOU FIGURED?
YES, SIR.
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
THOSE FIGURES
AND SHOVE THEM UP
YOUR ARROGANT LITTLE ASS
AND SET FIRE TO THEM.
I DON'T OWE YOU
A GOD DAMN THING.
NOW GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE!
I'LL BRING MY .5O DOWN
AND GIVE YOU A REAL GAME.
YEAH. WE, UH, WE SAW
SOME OF YOUR MEN
UP THERE
ON THE HIGH RANGE.
PASSED RIGHT BY THEM.
FINE BUNCH.
MR. CHISUM...
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE LINCOLN COUNTY WAR
IS OVER.
WE JUST WANT TO
GET OUT OF HERE,
GET DOWN BELOW.
OH, YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW
ALL RIGHT, DOC.
YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW.
YOU'RE BILLY THE KID,
TOO, YOU KNOW.
YOU ALL ARE
DIRTY LITTLE BILLY BASTARDS,
AND I DON'T OWE YOU
ANYTHING, DOC.
OR YOU, CHAVEZ...
YOU TOOK MY FARM,
MR. CHISUM.
YOU TOOK A LOT OF FARMS,
MR. CHISUM.
AS LONG AS BILLY THE KID
IS TAKING SOME BACK,
I'M WITH HIM.
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MR. CHISUM?
YES, YES.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
UH...GO ON AND BRING
THE MEN IN,
AND WE'LL HAVE
A LITTLE FRESH COFFEE
WITH THE BOYS HERE.
YOO-HOO!
I'LL MAKE YOU FAMOUS.
MR. CHISUM, WHICH ONE
OF THESE BOYS
IS THE FASTEST
WITH THE IRON?
DON'T YOU DO IT,
BILLY.
THAT BE ME.
YOU.
DROP SAM COLT.
BILLY...
PUT HER DOWN NOW.
STEP AWAY.
YOU OWE ME $5OO,
MR. CHISUM,
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
IS KILL ONE OF YOUR MEN
FOR EVERY $5.OO YOU OWE ME.
ONLY I'M GOING TO
DO IT FAIR.
HOW'S THAT FOR SQUARE?
NOW, WHEN I GO FOR MY GUN,
YOU START SHOOTING.
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT.
READY?
YEAH, I'M READY.
DAVE.
OH, MY GOD!
HENDRY.
OH, MY GOD!
HENDRY.
49O.
YOU JUST KILLED YOURSELF.
BONNEY, YOU ARE A FOOL!
YOU CALL YOURSELF
THE SCOURGE OF NEW MEXICO?
WELL, BY GOD,
IAMNEW MEXICO,
AND YOU ARE DEAD.
HA HA!
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MR. NEW MEXICO.
I WOULDN'T GIVE
A BUCKET OF PISS
FOR YOUR FUTURE.
SKIN OUT, BOYS.
YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A GOOD DAY NOW.
I WANT HIM DEAD.
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
HE'S PROTECTED
BY THE SURROUNDING
COMMUNITIES.
THEY'VE
MADE A BLOODY HERO
OUT OF A HALF-WIT
COMMON HORSE THIEF.
THAT'S WHAT I SAY!
LET'S HIRE A THIEF
TO CATCH ONE.
NOW BRING HIM IN,
GOVERNOR,
AND MAKE THE OFFER.
PENDLETON.
IF I'VE BEEN BROUGHT HERE
TO BE, UH...
IMPLICATED IN ANYTHING,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M A FAMILY MAN,
FIXING TO SETTLE
AND RUN A BUSINESS.
MR. CHISUM HAS INFORMED US
OF YOUR AMBITIONS,
MR. GARRETT.
NOW, WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN WITH BILLY BONNEY
SEVERAL TIMES
WHEN HE CUT MY HERD.
NOW, PAT,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS HIS HAUNTS,
HIS, UH, HIDEOUTS,
SOMEBODY WHO'S FAMILIAR
WITH HIS PATTERNS.
YOUAREFAMILIAR WITH HIM,
MR. GARRETT.
YOU SEE, PATRICK...
CERTAIN CHANGES
NEED TO BE STRUCTURED.
WE NEED A SHERIFF
WHO CAN ELIMINATE
THIS PARTICULAR...
PROBLEM.
I DON'T QUITE FOLLOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
WE'RE SAYING
SHERIFF OF LINCOLN COUNTY.
SHERIFF PAT GARRETT.
NOW THAT OUGHT TO
MAKE YOU FEEL PRETTY GOOD.
AND WE'RE SAYING $5OO...
UP FRONT.
AND 5OO AFTER.
$1,OOO, MR. GARRETT.
AND ALL THE RESOURCES
YOU NEED
TO CARRY OUT
THE EXTERMINATION
OF ONE
WILLIAM H. BONNEY.
IS THAT SATISFACTORY?
WHILE PAT WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE SANTA FE RING'S
GENEROUS OFFER,
ME AND THE BOYS WERE BUSY
SORTING OUT OUR FINANCES.
WE FIGURED THAT IF IT WAS
TOO MUCH OF A HARDSHIP
FOR CHISUM
TO GIVE US ANY MONEY...
HOWDY.
WELL,
THEN WE'D HELP HIM OUT
AND JUST TAKE
A FEW OF HIS COWS.
I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
YOU'RE CALLED KID,
AND RUDABAUGH'S
CALLED ARKANSAS DAVE,
AND, UH, I DARESAY
DOC'S CHRISTIAN NAME
AIN'T DOC.
YOU WANT A NAME.
YES, SIR.
I WOULD LIKE THAT.
I WOULD LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH INDEED.
YOU HAVE TO EARN IT,
HENDRY.
UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE STUCK
WITH PLAIN OLD HENDRY.
SORRY.
[RINGING]
[CLICK]
STILL TRYING TO GET
THIS RAG SHEET
OFF THE GROUND, ASH?
THE COPY IS GOOD.
THE MACHINE IS BAD.
I HEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OPENING UP AN EATING HOUSE,
GARRETT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SECURE
AN ADVERTISEMENT?
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
JEEZUM CROW.
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
THE SANTA FE RING HIRED--
NEVER MIND THAT.
I WANT TO HIRE YOU
FOR A JOB.
YOU DO?
I WANT YOU TO DOCUMENT
THE HUNT
FOR THE MOST FAMOUS MAN
IN NEW MEXICO.
I WANT
A BOOK WRITTEN ON IT
SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.
I WANT YOU
TO RIDE ALONG WITH ME
AND RECORD THE DANGERS
OF THE EXPEDITION.
RIDEALONG WITH YOU?
ON A HORSE?
OH, NO.
THIS I CAN'T DO.
I CAME OUT WEST
TO SAVE MY LAST LUNG.
I'M A JOURNALIST.
YOU'RE
A BROKE JOURNALIST,
AND YOU'RE A DRUNK.
THE COUNTRY WAS OVERGROWN
WITH WEED AND BRUSH
AND ENCUMBERED
WITH LOOSE ROCK,
MAKING IT
ALMOST IMPASSABLE.
I LIKE THAT.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
MORNING, SHERIFF.
WE MET AT THE GOVERNOR'S.
JOHN W. POE,
CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION.
THE GOVERNOR SENT ME
AND THESE MEN
TO LEND YOU A HAND.
ENCUMBERED BY IDIOTS,
WE PRESSED ON.
I LIKE THAT.
IT'S VERY GOOD.
WHAT DID THEY DO NOW--
SPELL YOUR NAME WRONG?
THEY GOT A NEW SHERIFF
ON US, BOYS.
GOES BY THE NAME
OF PAT GARRETT.
JESUS CHRIST!
WHAT THE HELL
DID HE DO THAT FOR?
MAKE HISSELF FAMOUS.
BE A KNOWN MAN LIKE ME.
HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT DID THEY SAY
ABOUT ME, HUH?
NOTHING, DAVE.
JUST PLAYING THE GAME,
DOC.
WE'LL GIVE HIM A GAME,
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, DAVE'S BOYS.
WE RIDE NOW.
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE
PAT GARRETT
THE RIDE OF HIS MISERABLE
TWO-FACED STINKING LIFE.
LET'S SKIN OUT! COME ON!
WELL, COME ON!
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?
OK, TOM.
LAST ONE OUT OF HERE
DRINKS DIRTY DISHWATER.
COME ON!
SON OF A BITCH!
HO.
BURIAL GROUND.
WARM SPRINGS PEOPLE.
APACHE.
WE BETTER GET GOING.
WE'LL GO AROUND.
WHAT IS IT--
CHAVEZ, WHY DON'T YOU
GO PECK SHIT
WITH THE CHICKENS, HUH?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE PAYING
FOR APACHE BONE
IN SILVER CITY RIGHT NOW?
CHRIST ALMIGHTY,
THEY'RE MAKING...
THEY'RE MAKING ASHTRAYS,
THEY'RE MAKING COMBS,
THEY'RE MAKING
KNIFE HANDLES.
YOU GET 5O CENTS
FOR A GOOD INDIAN LEG BONE.
IT'S ALL OUT THERE,
SO DON'T YOU GO GETTING
SENTIMENTAL AND ALL THAT,
COME ON.
YOU GO IN THERE,
SMART GRINGO,
AND I'LL BURY YOU
THERE.
OK.
LET'S GO.
COME ON. YAH!
COME ON.
WHOA.
WHOO!
SILVER CITY,
HERE I COME!
AAAH!
NO!
YAH!
UGH!
UHH!
SHIT.
SHIT.
SON OF A...
I DON'T THINK SO,
DAVE.
THAT MEXICAN-INDIAN
MAY HAVE LOST HIS FAMILY,
BUT HE HADN'T LOST A TRICK
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO
AN OLD-FASHIONED
PIG-STICKING MATCH.
YOU WANT
YOUR KNIFE BACK?
SHIT.
YEAH.
AND DAVE...
WELL, HE APPRECIATED
THE VALUE OF FAIR PLAY,
BUT HE ALSO APPRECIATED
THE VALUE
OF A GOOD BONE-HANDLED KNIFE.
AND WE WERE GOINGAROUND
THAT CEMETERY,
I PROMISE YOU.
THANK YOU.
GARRETT!
GET ME OFF
THIS ANIMAL!
I HAVE TO HAVE
A MOVEMENT!
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A WHAT?
HE HAS TO HAVE
A SHIT.
I HAVE TO HAVE
A MOVEMENT.
THAT'S THE FOURTH ONE
TODAY.
AAAH!
SHERIFF, AT THE RISK
OF OFFENDING YOU,
YOUR NEWSPAPERMAN
IS HINDERING
AN IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT OPERATION.
I HAVE TO REQUEST
THAT HE BE DISCHARGED
FROM SERVICE.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?
TOBACCO POUCH.
IT'S HIS.
I GAVE IT TO HIM.
IT'S BUFFALO SCROTUM
FROM MY FIRST KILL,
BIG OLD BULL
NEAR FORT GRIFFIN.
THAT'S A PRETTY STORY,
SHERIFF.
WHY'D HE LEAVE IT
HANGING THERE LIKE THAT?
JUST TO SAY HELLO.
LOOKS LIKE HE'S SAYING
MORE THAN HELLO.
WHAT'S ''SCUM''?
WELL, TOM,
THAT'S BAD TYPES--
POLITICIANS, BANKERS,
CATTLE KINGS--
SCUM.
COME ON.
COME ALONG, MOTHER.
WELL, I'LL BE HOG-TIED
AND SENT TO HADES!
BILLY!
AHH!
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
HOW ARE YOU, JANE?
WICKED BOYS!
4, 5, 6 WICKED BOYS.
WICKED AND WANTED
OR JUST PLAIN WICKED?
$1,OOO ON ME.
YEAH?
I HEARD $5OO.
WELL, YOU HEARD
WRONG, JANE.
I ALSO HEARD YOU AIN'T LONG
FOR THE TERRITORY, BILLY.
WE'RE NOT. WE'RE GOING TO
OLD MEXICO, RIGHT, BILLY?
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
HOW OLD'S THIS FELLA?
14 AND--
OH, WELL,
DON'T FORGET THAT HALF.
THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
PACKED INTO THAT HALF.
IT'S DIFFERENT.
WHAT? MY HAIR?
IT'S THE NEW FASHION.
YOU LIKE IT?
YEAH, YOUR HAIR,
BUT EVERYTHING.
THIS WHOLE TOWN,
OUTSIDE, TOO.
THEY GOT A CHURCH.
THIS AIN'T
WHITE OAKS.
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S 2,011
SOULS IN THIS TOWN, KID,
A LOT OF BACK EAST MONEY.
THE TOWN'S DIFFERENT.
IT'S RESPECTABLE.
YOU'RE NOT TELLING US
YOU'VE GONE RESPECTABLE
NOW, JANE, HAVE YOU?
NO. WELL, TO THE EYE
THAT DON'T KNOW NO BETTER,
YEAH, I HAVE.
WELL,
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
MY BOYS HERE WOULD LIKE
SOME BOONDA UPSTAIRS
RIGHT QUICK, DARLING.
DID I HEAR YOU SAY
YOU'D LIKE
AN EXCELLENT MALT
SIX-TIMES SERVED IN A ROOM
WITH A SOUTHERN VIEW?
YOU'RE A LADY
TO THE MANOR BORN, JANE.
TO THE MANOR BORN.
HE'S HURT PRETTY GOOD.
LOOKS LIKE THE MUSKRATS
ARE IN A TRAP.
THEY'RE CHEWING
THEIR OWN LEGS OFF.
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE GOING NORTH.
SOUTH, YOU MEAN.
NO, I MEAN NORTH.
BUT, SHERIFF,
LAST TIME I HEARD,
OLD MEXICO'S
STILL SOUTH.
YOU EVER HEAR OF
A COYDOG, POE?
HALF COMMON DOG,
HALF COYOTE.
FEED ONE, HE KEEPS
COMING AROUND.
NO FEAR OF MAN.
KID'S A COYDOG.
HE'S COME 15O MILES
WITHOUT A TOWN.
RIGHT ABOUT NOW,
HE'S LOOKING FOR
SOME ATTENTION.
ASH!
HE AIN'T MY CONCERN.
[SPEAKING APACHE LANGUAGE]
OH!
[SPEAKING APACHE LANGUAGE]
SHERIFF, I THINK
I NEED TO HAVE A MOVEMENT.
ME, TOO.
UHH! UHH!
''OVER THE MOUNTAINS
OF THE MOON,
''DOWN THE VALLEY
OF THE SHADOW,
''RIDE, BOLDLY, RIDE,
THE SHADE REPLIED--
IF YOU SEEK
FOR ELDORADO!''
MY, THAT WAS HEAVENLY.
WHO WROTE IT?
JOSIAH ''DOC'' SCURLOCK.
WHO THE HELL'S THAT?
NOW, YOU COME BACK NOW.
WHOO!
[BED SHAKING
AND LAUGHTER]
[HOOFBEATS]
OH, NO.
BILLY!
LOOK OUT THE WINDOW,
BILLY!
BILLY!
THEY DON'T TOLERATE SCUM.
HELP ME GATHER
THE BOYS.
GO ON. GET ROLLING
DOWNSTAIRS.
BILLY THE KID!
ALIAS WILLIAM H. BONNEY!
IT'S DEPUTY CARLYLE.
I BEST GO SPEAK TO HIM.
...AND DAVE RUDABAUGH
OF LAS VEGAS!
HE SAID DAVE RUDABAUGH
OF LAS VEGAS!
I'M REAL HAPPY FOR YOU,
DAVE.
...BLACK KNIGHTS
ON THE PREMISES,
TURN YOUR BODIES
OVER TO THE LAW...
OR PERISH IN FLAME.
DEPUTY CARLYLE, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON DOWN HERE?
BILLY THE KID,
WE HAVE JANE GREATHOUSE
HELD OUT HERE.
I'M COMING IN
TO TALK TO YOU.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME,
THE CITIZENS HERE
SAY THEY WILL STRING HER UP
AND BURN HER.
DO YOU AGREE TO THOSE TERMS?
DO I AGREE
TO THOSE TERMS?
HA HA HA!
WHO IS THIS GUY?
YES, SIR, WE AGREE
TO THOSE TERMS.
I'M GOING IN.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
PUT YOUR GUNS AWAY
AND LOOK RESPECTABLE.
LADIES, UPSTAIRS.
O'FOLLIARD, DISAPPEAR.
GENTLEMEN.
AHEM! AHEM!
GENTLEMEN, WHICH OF YOU
IS THE LEADER OF YOUR GANG?
THAT WOULD BE ME.
ARKANSAS DAVE.
YOU ARE NOT, DAVE.
I AM SO.
YOU ARE NOT.
I AM SO!
ARE NOT!
AHEM! GENTLEMEN,
I'M A DEPUTIZED MAN,
AND I DO THINGS
THE LAW WAY.
WHICH WAY?
LAW WAY.
LAW WAY. I SEE.
OK, GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
NOW, THE PEOPLE OUT THERE,
THEY DO THINGS
THEIR OWN WAY.
THEY GOT THEIR MINDS
SET ON A HANGING.
NOW,
IT'S GOING TO BE HELL
IF I CAN'T CONTROL
THIS SITUATION.
SO, WHAT I PROPOSE
IS THIS:
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
AN INDIAN IN YOUR GROUP.
YES, SIR.
JOSE CHAVEZ Y CHAVEZ.
HE'S A MEXICAN-INDIAN.
HOW'D THAT BE?
WELL, THAT'LL BE
JUST FINE.
IF I CAN GIVE THIS INDIAN
TO THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE,
THEY'LL BE
WELL SATISFIED.
THE REST OF YOU
CAN JUST RIDE OUT.
HA HA! YOU HEAR THAT,
CHAVEZ?
SIR, I AGREE
TO THOSE TERMS.
THEY'RE AN ANGRY MOB,
INDEED,
AND WE DO HAPPEN TO HAVE
AN INDIAN
ON THE PREMISES.
GIVE ME YOUR HAT.
NOW, MR. LAW WAY,
MAY I SEE YOUR HAT?
I REALLY DON'T SEE
HOW HATS ARE RELEVANT
IN THIS SITUATION.
I DO.
DAVE.
THE GENTLEMAN'S
JACKET.
THERE.
MR. CARLYLE!
NOW I CAN
TALK TO YOU.
NOW YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
SUCH A POLITICIAN.
CAN I TAKE THE INDIAN
WITH ME OR NOT?
THE INDIAN'S GOING OUT
TO SATISFY THE CROWD,
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE MEANING
OF THE WORD ''PALS.''
THINK I'D HAND
MY FRIEND OVER TO
A BUCKET OF MULE DUNG
LIKE YOU?
THAT'S AN INSULT.
TURN AROUND, CHIEF.
[GUNS COCK]
COME ON, CARLYLE!
YOU BRINGING HIM OUT OR NOT?
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WHITE CAPS!
WE'RE COMING OUT,
BUT WE'RE COMING OUT
SHOOTING!
GET READY FOR WAR!
[INDIAN WAR WHOOPING CALL]
UH-OH.
OH, MY GOD!
THAT'S DEPUTY CARLYLE.
THAT'S JAMES CARLYLE.
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
THEY'RE LEAVING.
THEY'RE ALL SKINNING OUT.
PALS.
OF COURSE,
THEY WERE SKINNING OUT.
THEY HAD JUST MURDERED
THEIR OWN DEPUTY.
THEY PINNED THAT ONE
ON ME, TOO,
BUT I NEVER FIRED
ONE SHOT.
JUST SAYING ''HELLO,'' PAT?
DID YOU ENTERTAIN HIM?
MAYBE.
DID YOU LIKE IT?
MAYBE.
REMEMBER THE TIME YOU, ME,
AND HIM LOCKED ALL THE DOORS,
STAYED UP TILL THE SUN,
BREAKING THE PLACE UP
WITH SIX-SHOOTERS?
EVERY BOTTLE IN THE BAR...
NAKED AS JAYBIRDS...
AND THERE WAS NO LAW.
NO LAW...
AND NO BARBED WIRE.
PATRICK,
I'M GOING TO PART
WITH A NASTY SECRET.
YOU USED TO MAKE ME
HOTTER THAN A JUNE BRIDE
SITTING BAREBACK
ON A DEPOT STOVE,
BUT I DON'T SHARE MY BED
WITH THE LAW.
AND I DON'T KEEP
WITH WHORES NO MORE.
SO AIN'T WE BOTH CONTENT?
JANE GREATHOUSE,
THE CITIZENS OF WHITE OAKS
HAVE PROCLAIMED THIS PLACE
THE DEVIL'S DEN.
AS SHERIFF
OF LINCOLN COUNTY,
I HAVE TO HONOR AND PROTECT
THEIR CIVIC VIRTUES.
I'LL SHOW THEM
WHAT MY CIVIC VIRTUES
LOOK LIKE,
ALL THOSE
STALL-FED TENDERFEET
WITH THEIR EASTERN
SHINPLASTER
AND THEIR SUNDAY WIVES
AND THEIR SUNDAY DRESSES
WITH THE PREACHER
AT THE BACK DOOR
BY MORNING
TO SEE IF THEY'VE GOT
THE CONNECTICUT BLUE LAWS
TATTOOED ON THEIR
LILY-WHITE BUTTOCKS!
LET IT BURN!
LET IT BURN!
THE TOWN WILL BE
BETTER OFF--
OH, LORD.
AAAH!
I DON'T BELIEVE
I'M SEEING THIS.
WHOA!
THIS TOWN WILL
NEVER BE THE SAME.
WHITE OAKS,
YOU CAN KISS MY ASS!
SURE.
ANYTIME, HONEY.
HEY, IS THIS ONE
READY TO GO?
IT CAN GO,
DOWN IN THAT
NUMBER TWO LANE.
LET IT GO!
LET IT GO!
HEY!
YOU GOT ANY WATER?
OLD-TIMER,
WHEN DID THIS PLACE BOOM UP?
LAST WEEK.
COPPER?
NAH! GUANO.
BAT DROPPINGS.
BAT DROPPINGS?
I'VE BEEN
TO GOLD TOWNS,
SILVER TOWNS,
I'VE EVEN BEEN
TO TURQUOISE TOWNS,
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO A BAT SHIT TOWN.
CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE WOMEN.
YAH!
YAH!
UGH!

AAAH!
HEY!
HAH!
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT TIME.
WE'LL GO BACK
THROUGH THE ARROYO.
WELL, THAT'S CONVENIENT,
AIN'T IT?
PARDON ME?
THE KID'LL BE LONG GONE.
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT, PAT.
WHAT I WANT
IS FOR YOU TO CORK
YOUR GOD DAMN
GOVERNMENT MOUTH,
AND THE NEXT TIME
YOU ADDRESS ME COMMON,
I WILL PUT YOU ON
YOUR PRISSY LITTLE ASS.
SWEET MARY'S ASS!
HOW THE HELL DID YOU
GET THEM TO DO THAT?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN
ANYWAY? ASSAY, ASSAY?
IT'S AN ANCIENT
NAVAHO WORD.
IT MEANS STOP.
STOP?
YAH! YAH!
WHEN WE GET TO THE TOP
OF THIS BLUFF,
WE'LL HAVE A CLEAR VIEW
OF THE NACHITA RIVER.
WE'LL SELL
THE HORSES OFF,
AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A SKIFF
DOWNRIVER INTO MEXICO.
HEY, TOMMY,
LAST ONE UP THE HILL'S
A THREE-LEGGED DOG!
WHOO!
YAY!
BILLY!
IS THIS OLD MEXICO?
NO.
IT'S GARRETT!
GET DOWN, TOM!
I GOT HIM.
UHH! UHH! UHH!
Oh, my God.
YOU SHOT ME.
YOU REALLY SHOT ME.
TAKE YOUR MEDICINE, SON.
WELL,
IT'S A START.
[SINGING IN NAVAHO LANGUAGE]
I SPENT A LOT OF NIGHTS
IN THIS CABIN
AFTER THE LINCOLN WAR.
TRIED TO PUT
ANOTHER OUTFIT TOGETHER,
BUT IT WAS NEVER THE SAME.
WHEN YOU BOYS CAME BACK,
I FELT LIKE THERE WAS NOTHING
I WOULDN'T DO
TO KEEP THE GANG TOGETHER,
KEEP RIDING.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
CHIVATO?
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE MEXICAN BLACKBIRD IS?
A BROKEN TRAIL THAT
LEADS TO OLD MEXICO.
IT'S A HALF-BLACK,
HALF-MEXICAN WHORE
UP IN PUERTO DE LUNA.
SO YOU MEAN...
YOU NAMED THE TRAIL
AFTER HER, RIGHT?
THERE IS NO TRAIL,
IS THERE, BILLY?
IS THERE?
WHAT ABOUT OLD MEXICO?
YOU PROMISED US.
I'D BE JUST ANOTHER
GRINGO IN OLD MEXICO.
IT'S THE SAME
AS BEING DEAD.
WHAT ABOUT TOMMY?
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU'RE STARTING TO BELIEVE
WHAT THEY'RE WRITING ABOUT YOU,
AREN'T YOU?
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT YOU REALLY ARE.
YOU RODE A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY
STRAIGHT INTO HIS GRAVE...
AND THE REST OF US
STRAIGHT TO HELL.
STRAIGHT TO HELL.
YOU, BONNEY...
YOU ARE NOT A GOD.
WHY DON'T YOU PULL
THE TRIGGER AND FIND OUT?
I GOT TO GET BACK HOME.
UGH!
DOC!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
WE'RE NOT IN POSITION YET!
THEY KILLED HIM!
THAT BASTARD KILLED YOU!
GET UP, DOC!
COME ON. GET UP!
YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE!
HE'S A DEAD MAN!
THEY'RE STARTING TO SURROUND US.
WE GOT TO SKIN OUT OF HERE!
PAT!
WE GOT TO
MAKE A BREAK.
DON'T LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK UP.
SO WHO'S GOING TO
BUST OUT FIRST?
HENDRY WILLIAM FRENCH,
YOU NEVER KILLED NOBODY.
THEY AIN'T GONNA
SHOOT AT YOU.
GO TO HELL!
THEY SHOT TOMMY!
SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA DO IT!
THERE MUST BE AT LEAST
1O OF THEM OUT THERE.
GET ME UP.
DAVE...
IT'S YOUR GANG.
WHAT?
IT'S YOUR GANG.
YOU LEAD US OUT.
IT AIN'T MY GANG!
IT'S YOUR GANG!
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
YOUR GANG.
DON'T CROSS ME, DAVE.
BILLY!
LET'S FINISH THE GAME.
AAAAH!
GO! GO!
COME ON, CHAVEZ! GO!
AAAH!

PAT!

YOU KILLED A BOY!
AAAH!

[Shoveling]
[Birds chirping]
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground.
For out of it we was taken.
Dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return.
Heavenly father,
pick this child up on the healing side.
Put the grave behind
for the promise on the other side,
that she might live and abide with you.
Boy as old man:
When sister died,
there weren't none but women and old men to bury her.
All of the able-bodied men
had gone off to fight the Civil War.
I know something about the Civil War.
The story I'm about to tell is true
as best I remember it.
We buried sister in the spring of 1862.
Later that night,
some Yankee bastards dug her up
and tossed her out like a rag doll,
on account of Paps siding with the South.
In these Cumberland mountains
down near the
Tennessee line,
half the folks sided with the South.
The other half sided with the North.
The neighbors turned against their neighbors,
and it was rough through here.
Giddyup.
Whoa.
We heard.
We can bury her again.
Israel can stand guard.
We're gonna take her home.
There'll be hell to pay.
So we brung sister back home to our place
Up at the end of
Meshack Creek.
Ma was mad about things.
She held it in,
And we went on
With the work of feeding ourselves.
[Talking to mule]
[Horses whinny]
Mama!
Man: Whoa!
Mama, men coming.
Yankees.
They'll steal everything we got.
Will they hurt us?
Maybe not.
Go on! Go on!
[Cow bell clanging]
Are you Sarah Anders?
I am.
Ma'am, they say your husband's fighting against his country.
We have orders to resupply
With contraband from the enemy.
That means we'll take forage provisions from you.
We got some hungry boys down in Cumberland Gap.
I apologize for your hardship.
How many you got here with you?
How many?
Me and my boy.
Where is he?
Boy, you go stand by your mother.
Sarah: Come here.
Come here.
Ma'am, I will not hurt you or your boy, if you give us no trouble.
All right.
Take no prisoners.
You got a nice place.
[Gunshot]
I got a piece of bottomland across the River.
Ohio River.
Brown County, Ohio.
Raise hogs, corn, sorghum, mostly.
You should stay there.
[Gunshot]
Ma'am?
Captain?
Uh, there weren't no hams in the smokehouse.
And there's no cows or pigs in the stall.
Just cow shit and pig shit.
Well, see what's in there.
Mmm. Bread.
[Hen clucks]
[Braying]
She don't own nigs.
He work like them.
What you think he is fighting for?
Keep us from stealing his chickens?
That's a good reason.
[Growls]
Shit!
Johnny dog.
[Kiss]
Neely, meet the elephant.
Shit...
That a fresh grave?
I'll tell where our cow is.
Well, I've seen all kinds of hiding places.
[Cowbell clangs]
She's up there.
[Gunshot]
Rodie!
Newt!
Captain?
A cow is up there somewheres.
Neely, Chicago, come on up.
Captain, we take the mule?
Uhh...
No.
Ma'am, I apologize for the things this war makes.
Ugh...
Aah!
Newt!
Oh! Oh, no!
Newt!
I fell off!
I fell off!
I fell off!
Roll him on his side.
Rodie, keep that leg still!
All right, somebody...
Somebody get him something to bite.
Oh, no! No!
Here, Newt, chew on this.
You all ready?
Oh, no!
Let's get him to the house.
[Screaming]
It hurts!
It hurts.
Spin him!
[Newt shrieking]
There's a damn dog under the bed.
Well, I'll kill the sum'bitch!
Captain: Neely, rip up that pillowcase!
Yes, sir.
Ma'am, you got some liniment oil?
No.
You got some whisky?
No.
Well, can you boil water?
Get the turpentine out of the harness shed.
Rodie, get some water.
Neely, light that damn fireplace.
Hold still!
[Men coughing]
What's she got up there?
A ham and a rifle.
Captain?
Man: All right, all right, soldier.
[Vulture screeching]
All right, all right.
Settle down.
It burns, don't it?
Well...
You want a chew?
No.
Look, he's sweating.
We can't move him until the fever breaks.
You can sleep in there if you want to.
I told the men to sleep in the barn.
I'm gonna keep ahold of this musket of yours.
I don't like this at all...
Staying here.
We've got plenty to eat.
Yeah...
Maybe them buzzards will, too.
[Speaking Polish]
Boy: Is he gonna die?
Like Jesse?
If the skinny Yankee gets well... he might be the one shooting at your pap.
You wash your face?
One day... your pap will come around up the creek.
Until then, you're the man around here.
You need to sleep.
Got to bear up.
[Snoring]
Captain?
It's me, Rodie.
Damn, Neely.
Captain, the woman's gone.
The woman's gone?
Mm-hmm.
You should try and get some sleep.
I'll look for her.
Yes, sir.
Elephant...
Elephant.
[Knock knock]
Who's there?
It's me.
Corporal Neely said you was gone.
Am I under arrest?
Who's buried here?
Excuse me for asking.
First Yankee that dies in Altmara,
I'm gonna go down.
And I'm gonna dig up the son of a bitch.
We buried her in Altmara.
The Yankees living down there wouldn't abide that...
Her mixed in with their damn Yankee kin.
Your daughter?
They dug her up.
We brought her back here.
Her pap don't even know.
She smelled so bad.
There'll be hell to pay.
[Sobbing]
[Chicago "introducing" himself to audience in Polish]
Rodie?
Yeah?
Use the damn outhouse.
Sir?
There's a woman about.
Yes, sir.
It burns like hell, don't it?
Damn, it hurts.
Well, it's supposed to, now.
Is that fresh milk?
He can't keep the hard stuff down.
[Newt coughing]
Thank you, ma'am.
[Boy talking to mule]
Whoa, whoa.
Well, the Yankees could steal what we had.
But not what we hadn't got yet.
So I was determined to put in
next year's corn crop.
I was young but I was stout,
and I could handle a mule as well as any man.
Your reins are too tight.
That's why she's drifting.
Whoa, whoa.
You need three fingers of slack right here.
I got a matched pair of sorrel mules back home
That turn on a skinny dollar.
Must be about 10, huh?
That old, huh?
Put some salt in his feed,
And you might get
A couple more crop years out of her.
Come on, come on!
The Yankee captain
asked if he could turn a few rows.
I didn't see the harm in it.
It made my job easier, you see.
And that morning was the first
I seen mama wear her green dress
to the plow field.
Captain:
Hyah! Hyah!
How's Newt?
You ain't been in to see him?
Cain't.
Bad luck.
This is not bad luck.
He is not dead.
It's a gut wound.
Ain't nothing you can do.
What's he doing out there?
Captain:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He is a widower.
He's, um...
Brushing off the cobwebs.
He ain't much of a soldier.
Whoa, whoa.
Thank you, sir.
Where's your husband fighting?
The army of Tennessee.
Was he at Shiloh?
Yeah.
That was a bad mess.
You was there?
No...
No.
No, we never been in a big scrape.
"Meet the elephant," boys call it.
Ma'am, last night,
What you said about your little girl.
I'm real sorry.
Sorry don't do nothing.
Don't stop you from taking our cow or ham,
Killing our chickens.
Well, you have a corn crop.
Some have it worse.
So that's it?
You's out here blistering up your hands
To make you feel better about stealing from us?
If I was you,
I'd take advantage.
These blisters can't hold out much longer.
Captain: Come on.
Ahem.
What?
Hell, Neely, they were starting to smell.
Go ahead. Smell.
You can't leave dead chickens in a rucksack for 2 days!
Corporal!
Uh...
Uh, captain?
Corporal.
Them chickens are starting to smell.
Well, pluck 'em.
Uh, pluck 'em, sir?
How do you do this?
- I ain't.
- I might.
They say you cannot know who does and who don't. It will surprise you.
You ain't running from the elephant, are you?
Me?
Yeah, you.
No.
You get shot a lot easier showing them your backside.
And you know something about this?
I joined up to fight.
No...
No, I ain't running.
Yeah, I know something about it.
Rodie, we ain't soldiers.
We are chicken thieves.
You kiss my brown spot.
I joined up to fight.
My brother saw action.
Wildcat, mule springs, Shiloh.
He said you become a new man, with your first shot.
Dead and dying... hardly get a passing thought.
Become cool and deliberate.
[Gunshots]
[Gunshot]
Captain!
Corporal?
You hear it?
Hear what?
Gunfire.
Whoa, whoa. What?
There was shooting from over there.
Squirrel hunters most likely.
Go ride over and find out.
Ride over?
Might run straight up to an ambush.
I'm in charge.
Neely, only reason you got that stripe is you too bold-ass dumb to think for yourself.
Are you a general?
General, huh?
No, just a captain.
How many men you killed?
You really want to know?
None.
Rodie?
What?
You feel cool and deliberate?
Nothing's moving.
Damn.
We should...
We should bury them.
We'd have to hang around to do that.
You want to hang around?
Hyah!
Want a chew?
Thank you.
[Horses neigh]
Captain.
There was a farm burnt down.
Some old man and his wife were killed.
Where?
There.
No more than 5 Miles up the creek.
You know whose place it is?
Yankees.
Ma'am, they weren't Yankees.
Just some old farmer and his wife.
They sent two boys into the Union army.
They were just farmers.
Like I said, the war was rough through here.
How'd you sleep?
You're going to be fine, soldier.
Uh, how's Newt?
We're out of turpentine.
Captain, what do we do?
Oh...
I don't know.
We need to feed the boys back at the Cumberland Gap.
And that old farmer and his wife.
We should report back that there's some guerrilla outfit running around killing Unionists.
I think we got to wait Newt out.
He's too sick to ride.
We could hitch up the wagon to the mule, haul Newt out.
Giddyup, giddyup.
I won't let that woman and boy root hog or starve.
No. No, sir.
Whoa.
Will you let me do that?
I don't need your help.
Well, I like working with mules.
How's your hands?
Blisters on top of blisters.
Let me see.
Let me see.
All right.
That's fine. Thank you.
Come on!
I told you I got you.
I told you.
Captain, Newt took a poop.
I guess that's a good sign.
Rodie, make sure you clean up this porch.
My stomach hurts.
Worse than yesterday?
Mm-mmm.
Oh, you'll be fine.
You're not as hot.
How's he doing?
He's fine.
I'll make you some sassafras tea.
She's pretty.
You are feeling better.
[Laughing]
[Spits]
Ohh...
Hey, Johnny, I'm sorry.
You crossed my artillery line there.
Here, I'll let you spit back.
Go ahead.
You're scaring the boy.
No, he ain't scared.
Are you, Johnny?
Go ahead...
Spit.
Neely: Rodie, you got a mean streak.
Cool and deliberate.
[Coughing and gagging]
[Wheezing]
Captain?
Neely.
Uh, chicken's cooked.
Yes, yes.
I told you it was going to get burnt.
Pow...
Pow.
Chicago: You are looking rather well this evening.
Leave him alone!
Go to hell.
Chicago: Rodie!
Hey, hey, hey!
Is she crazy, captain?
Bastard!
Rodie hit her dog.
That damn Johnny dog ate my food, captain.
Soldier, I want you to apologize.
I'm telling you, captain, that woman is crazy.
If you want another plate, you'll apologize.
She hit me with a damn bucket!
Common decency tells you you don't pick up a woman and throw her against a wall!
Private, you're dismissed!
Sir!
Hope you get a piece.
What'd you say, soldier?
Rodie, shut up.
Spent your whole damn day, what?
Plowing her corn.
You cut her wood.
I'm sure she thinks you're a damn good samaritan.
You know what I think?
I think you just want a little poke.
Rodie!
Rodie, stop it!
Come on, Rodie!
Rodie!
I hope you kills each other.
You rot in hell.
You rot in hell!
Come here.
Come here.
We can't just sit by.
I want you to go tonight, to preacher's house.
And tell him that there's Yankees here, and he should get word to our people.
Don't talk to anyone but preacher.
And you have to be back before sunup.
- You understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.
These are yours.
Go on.
And I'm sorry.
There was some... ugly things said tonight about...
They weren't true.
No?
Don't think they were true.
Your little girl died, and...
Well, my wife died
3 years ago.
I miss her.
Miss my farm, my boy.
I come here to your place, and it looks a lot like my place...
We ain't gonna be friends.
Let's just keep to being enemies.
Yes, ma'am.
I forgot.
You have a better memory.
Ahem...
Is Newt asleep?
Yeah.
You know,
I don't think Rodie mean to be disrespecting.
His brother was killed by a rebel sniper.
He get crazy thinking about it. He's...
Where are you from?
Chicago.
No, I mean before that.
This small village in Poland.
It's just very small.
You damn foreigner.
Why get mixed up in this?
I think I get to see new places,
I get tired of chopping sausage.
Pretty thin reason to get shot at.
You got a better one?
I've heard your big reasons.
To save the union.
This is what the generals say.
To free the slaves?
Nobody that I know want to get killed to free a bunch of nigs.
It's a mess, ain't it?
Why did you...
Sign up?
Minister.
Brought a runaway slave into our church and ripped off his shirt.
Showed off the ugliest damn strap scars.
Right there from the pulpit, the minister asked for volunteers, and I stood up, and here I am...
Stealing chickens.
Hold on!
Preacher:
Who's there, Israel?
It's Miss Anders' boy.
They came up the creek on horses.
How many Yankees is there?
Which?
One's hurt real bad.
Pharaoh sent his army to smite Israel.
And they drowned in the Red Sea.
It was wrong what they done to your sister.
God's will is a powerful thing.
Mama, mama.
Where's your shoes?
What did preacher say?
What?
That's it's going to be all right.
Is he going to get word to our people?
To your pap?
I think so.
Don't be so thick.
What did he say?
I can't understand him.
Rodie, you can get shot for desertion.
You ain't gonna do it.
What makes you so sure?
Because...
You ain't sure.
You ain't no killer.
They wouldn't send no fighting man
To rob widows and orphans.
You can't even do that.
Rodie?
If you desert...
I'll kill you.
Got to go, captain.
Rodie.
Rodie!
Stop!
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
Shit! A sniper!
God dang it, get down!
Get inside, get inside!
Come on!
Go, go!
What is it?
Newt, keep your head down!
It's a damn sniper.
Is it pap?
I don't know.
Just keep still.
[Gunshots]
Captain: What the hell are you all shooting at?
We can't see the sons of bitches!
It's the elephant.
It is.
It's just a damn sniper.
I believe he's up on that hill.
Anybody here hurt?
You know who's up there?
You know who's out there?
Pap.
[Gunshot]
You need to say something?
You think Rodie's dead?
I don't know.
Captain?
What are we going to do?
You's all as good as dead.
It's time to meet the elephant.
I'll need one of you... to keep a gun on these... Rebs.
And I need the other to cause a faint.
Faint...
What is?
It's a decoy to draw the enemy's fire.
Chicago, I think you better do the decoy.
Here.
Yes, sir, captain.
You shoot them if they try to run for it.
Shoot?
Ready...
Go, go!
Get on!
Get out!
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Speaking Polish]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
Hold it!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What the hell?
Chicago: It's a nig.
Neely: Shooting for the wrong side.
# When the reaping is done #
# And the harvest is o'er #
# At the feet of the son
# We will labor no more
# Serving faithfully...
You killed my boy.
And he killed a federal soldier.
You'll burn in hell for your sins.
Then I guess we'll meet again.
Next time don't send your boy.
Fight your own fights, you rebel bastard.
# When the reaping is done #
We ought to string up that damn rebel preacher.
# And the harvest is o'er #
# At the feet of the son
# We will labor no more
# Serving faithfully
You get that wagon and mule ready.
We're hauling Newt out of here.
# What a Joy it will be
# When the reaping is done #
Hey!
[Speaking Polish]
You can't take our mule.
Oh, get him away from her!
Get him away!
Stop it.
Get him away!
Stop bein' so damn stubborn!
All right?
They're dead!
They're dead!
You son of a bitch!
You hear me?
You stop that!
Boy...
Get away from me!
Boy, you get!
There'll be hell to pay.
Yeah, you said that before.
Go on in there.
Make sure she don't strangle Newt.
Yes, sir, captain.
Hitch up that mule, bring the wagon around.
Yes, sir.
We're getting out of here, Newt.
I'm gonna miss the dog.
Shit...
Ahh!
Sorry, Newt.
Captain, we are ready.
Should we say some words?
You say it for yourself.
Bye, Rodie.
Giddyup!
What do you expect us to eat?
Ma'am.
I says, what do you expect us to eat?
Ma'am, that husband of yours...
Why don't you bring him home?
We'll all eat good.
I'm leaving your rifle.
Maybe the boy can shoot squirrels.
Ma'am, I took your powder.
Let's go.
I thought she was sweet on him.
No, you can't trust johnnies.
Come on, mule.
Whoa, shit!
What the hell happened?
[Gunshots]
I want you both to stay here.
Yes, sir.
What's he doing?
I think he's wanting to kill somebody.
Ohh!
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
I shot.
Shot what?
I heard shooting.
I shot a Yankee.
Do they know it was you?
Do they?
I don't know.
Come on! Come on!
Sarah Anders!
Did you forget something?
Newt was shot about a mile down the creek.
- You know anything about it?
- No.
Where's your boy?
I sent him up the spring.
Boy! Come here!
Your pants are wet.
I was up at the spring.
He was up at the spring.
Come here, boy.
Come here!
Now, did you kill Newt?
You look at him.
Did you kill Newt?
Your mother might tell you that it's all right to kill Yankees.
But I just want you to know that that boy...
He had a brother just like you.
And he had a family just like you!
And he never hurt a fly in his life!
And he wouldn't be dead If you hadn't come down here stealing from us!
We was doing fine until you showed up.
Don't blame it on...
Go ahead...
Kill us.
You know it scares me.
'cause I could.
I really could.
I just hope whoever killed Newt...
Has the common decency to give him a Christian burial.
What'd you do to them?
You heard the shots.
[Thunder rumbles]
Damn...
[Thunder rumbles]
Get that damn Yankee out of our yard.
The captain asked us to do the decent thing.
I don't guess the Civil War was about being decent.
We dug up the big redhead
and floated him down
Meshack Creek.
Ma said he come up that creek to cause trouble,
and we sent him back down where he come from.
We drug the skinny
Yankee up a hill
to a sinkhole.
Where a big sycamore tree had fallen over
and turned up its roots.
We throwed the skinny Yankee in the sinkhole,
throwed some dirt on him.
I don't guess Ma hated the skinny Yankee
as much as the big redhead.
[Thunder rumbles]
Pap never made it back.
That war was a widow-maker.
Ma told me to never never tell anyone
What we had done.
And I don't think I ever did...
Except maybe once, or maybe twice.
[Rain falling]

1879. The Civil War is over, and the resulting economic explosion spurs the great migration west.
Farmers, ranchers, prospectors, killers and thieves seek their fortunes.
Cattle drovers turn cow towns into armed camps with murder rates higher than those of modern-day New York or Los Angeles.
Out of this chaos comes legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, retiring his badge and gun to start a peaceful life with his family.
Earp's friend, John "Doc" Holliday, a Southern gentleman turned gunman and gambler, also travels west, hoping the dry climate will relieve his tuberculosis.
Silver is discovered in Arizona.
Tombstone becomes queen of the boomtowns, where the latest Paris fashions are sold from the backs of wagons.
Attracted to this atmosphere of greed, over 100 exiled Texas outlaws band together to form the ruthless gang recognised by the red sashes they wear.
They emerge as the earliest example of organised crime in America.
They call themselves the Cowboys.
Y'all killed two Cowboys.
Shoot.
Looks like we win.
Mexican police, huh?
Tell him to get on his knees.
He will not kneel, patr髇.
He is very proud.
Hey, somebody get this dick on his knees.
Good shot, Billy.
They call me Curly Bill Brocius.
I'm what you might call the Founder of the Feast.
So next time we come, you'd better step aside.
I ain't kiddin' neither.
Patr髇, he say, someone will come to revenge for him.
Something like a sick horse who comes to sit with him.
He talk crazy.
That's not what he said, ya ignorant wretch.
Your Spanish is worse than your English.
You go to hell!
You first.
- Hell, let's eat, boys.
- Tamales are good, huh?
I guess they knew we were comin'.
Hey, Johnny, what'd that Mexican mean,
"A sick horse is gonna get us"?
He's quoting the Bible,
Revelations.
"Behold, a pale horse.
The man who sat on him was Death."
"And Hell followed with him."
Move!
Come on! That's it! You move!
Stupid mule!
Come on! Come on, boy! Come on!
Hurts, don't it?
Now let go of that stud and go on about your business.
Mr Earp. My name's Dake.
Crawley Dake,
US Marshal for this territory.
- Forget it. I'm retired.
- Excuse me?
I said forget it.
I don't want the job, and that's final.
- I don't think you understand.
- No, you don't understand, Marshal.
I did my duty, and now I'd like to get on with my life.
I'm going to Tombstone.
- I see. To strike it rich.
- Easy on the grain, Butch.
- Here you go.
- Well, all right, that's fine.
Tell you one thing, though.
Never saw a rich man who didn't wind up with a guilty conscience.
I already got a guilty conscience.
Might as well have the money too.
Good day now.
That's him, all right.
Boy, I'd know that sour face anywhere.
Virgil! Morgan! My God!
- Hey, boy! How are you, Morgan?
- Hi, Wyatt.
- Well, how do we look?
- Great, both of ya.
- Wyatt, you remember Allie.
- Good God. Well, he'd better.
Allie girl.
- And Louisa. Oh!
- Wyatt.
You're so lovely, darlin'.
I'm at your feet, just at your feet.
I guess it's only right.
Ma always said Morgan's the prettiest.
- Yeah, but she doted on the frowner.
- That's right.
- Wyatt.
- Mattie!
Mattie, they're already here.
Folks, this is Celia Ann.
- You can call her Mattie.
- Pleased to meet you, Mattie.
It's nice to meet you.
Well, Wyatt, I couldn't find a single store that had laudanum anywhere.
That's all right, honey.
I sure been dreamin' about this.
God, since forever! Wait! Look here.
Go on up. Look. Huh?
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Don't talk, just...
Yeah.
Thank you for this, Wyatt.
- It's all your doin'.
- We'll make our fortune, boys.
Well, come on.
Gracious. We could be sisters.
Mighty fine.
I wonder where he found her.
Same place we found ours, probably.
Matter, hon? Did you say you needed some laudanum?
- Yes, I did. Yes.
- I have some right here.
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
Just be careful now. It's full of hop.
Oh, don't worry.
I just get headaches sometimes.
Hey, Virg, see anything of Doc while you were in Prescott?
Yeah. He had a streak when we left, him and Kate.
I miss Doc. I miss that old rip.
- I don't.
- He makes me laugh.
That's $500, Holliday.
Are you in or out?
500. Must be a peach of a hand.
Oh, thank you, darlin'.
Kate! You're not wearing a bustle.
How lewd.
Come on, Holliday, you in or out, goddamn it?
Why, Ed Bailey, you look like you're just about ready to burst.
Come on! Come on, show!
Well, I suppose I'm deranged, but I...
I guess I'll just have to call.
Cover your ears, darlin'.
Isn't that a daisy?
Why, you son of a bitch!
Damn, Bailey, just settle down!
Shut up! Take your money and get out,
'cause I'm tired of listenin' to your mouth.
Why, Ed Bailey, are we cross?
Them guns don't scare me.
'Cause without them guns you ain't nothin' but a skinny lunger.
Ed, what an ugly thing to say.
I abhor ugliness. Does this mean we're not friends any more?
You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend,
I just don't think I could bear it.
There. Now we can be friends again.
Touch that gun, I'll burn you down.
I calculate that's the end of this town.
I had a boy at the hotel pack us up.
The horse is outside.
So that's why you're not wearin' a bustle.
My sweet, soft Hungarian devil.
Well!
Good evenin', then.
Let's not bother about the luggage.
Hey, Morg, pretty big, isn't it?
Oh-ho, brother, you can smell the silver in this town.
- Easy.
- Look at these girls over here.
- Hi!
- Hello, girls!
Hot damn, this burg's jumpin'!
Here we go, ladies.
- Isn't that sweet?
- You can say that.
Sheriff.
Newcomers, eh?
The name's John Behan,
Cochise County Sheriff.
- Just hit town, did ya?
- Just this minute.
I'm Wyatt Earp, and these are my brothers, Virgil and Morgan.
Wyatt Earp. Dodge City.
Gave all that up, Sheriff.
Goin' into business.
- Don't even carry a gun any more.
- Going into business, huh?
Well, then, I'm the man to see.
Besides sheriff, I'm also tax collector, captain of the fire brigade and chairman of the Nonpartisan Anti-Chinese League.
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?
Yeah, a man of many parts.
- Say, you folks got a place to stay yet?
- No.
- Like I said, we just got here.
- I also sit on the town lot commission.
Really?
As a matter of fact, we got three lovely cottages coming up for rent.
I'll throw in a good cleaning, no charge.
Believe me, Mr Earp, you're not gonna find a better deal within town limits.
I don't know, sounds pretty good.
- I'll have my man show 'em to ya.
- Thank you.
Hey, Wyatt, get on over here.
I want you to meet Fred White.
He's the town marshal.
- My pleasure.
- Lotta law around here.
- I already met the county sheriff.
- Who, Behan?
He ain't no law. The only real law around here is the Cowboys.
Cowboys? I had a run-in with a couple of them up in Prescott.
Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
I mean, they're it.
There's three of 'em right over there.
You can always spot a Cowboy.
They always wear those red sashes.
The plain fact is the Cowboys are good for business.
'Bout all these saloons?
Oh, that's the real mother lode here in Tombstone.
All up and down Allen Street here.
24 hours a day, you got liquor, hostesses, gamblin', makin' money hand over fist.
All except The Oriental.
That's a regular slaughterhouse.
Even the high rollers won't go near it.
That's too bad too. It's a nice place.
Hell of a waste.
Wyatt?
- There he goes.
- Yeah.
OI' Wyatt.
All right, fella,
I'll brace ya now for a little lesson.
Put your money on the board.
$5 on that six of spades.
Like that.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get that cigar outta my face.
Howdy, stranger. What can I get ya?
I wouldn't mind one of those cigars.
I'm about ready to go home.
I wish y'all would stop yakkin'
- and just play cards.
- Thank you.
Kinda nice in here. You run it?
Milt Joyce, owner, operator.
- Wyatt Earp.
- Yeah, sure.
I said lay off the queen, you jackass!
I swear I'm gonna slap somebody now.
Excuse me for askin', Milt, but kinda dead in here, isn't it?
- You don't listen too good, do ya?
- See that bird at the faro table?
You back that queen again, you son of a bitch,
I'll blow you right up that wildcat's ass!
Do you hear me, huh?
He comes bargin' in here one day, slappin' all the customers, wavin' his gun around.
He chased out all the high-class play.
The only trade that comes in here now is the bummers and the drovers, just the dregs.
Why don't you get rid of him, get yourself a straight dealer?
Sure, stranger, that's easy for you to say.
Shit!
Goddamn it, Junior, how many times am I going to tell you to keep that damn cigar outta my face?
Christ almighty, it's like I'm sittin' here playing cards with my brother's kids or somethin', you nerve-racking sons of bitches.
Is somethin' on your mind?
Just want to let you know you're sittin' in my chair.
Is that a fact?
Yeah, it's a fact.
For a man that don't go heeled, you run your mouth kinda reckless, don't ya?
No need to go heeled to get the bulge on a dub like you.
Is that a fact?
That's a fact.
Well, I'm real scared.
Damn right, you're scared.
I can see that in your eyes.
- All right now!
- Go ahead.
Go ahead, skin it! Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens.
Listen, mister,
I'm gettin' awful tired of your...
I'm gettin' tired of your gas.
Nowjerk that pistol and go to work.
I said throw down, boy.
You gonna do somethin', or just stand there and bleed?
No?
I didn't think so.
Here, Milt, a keepsake.
Hang it over the bar.
All right, youngster, out you go.
Don't come back!
Ever!
Well, what do you say, Milt?
25% of the house take sound about right?
Well, we're off and runnin'.
Just acquired us a quarter interest in the game at the Oriental.
- Acquired?
- So to speak.
Now all we gotta do is keep our eyes on that brass ring, fellas.
You're the one, Wyatt.
Why, Johnny Tyler!
- You madcap!
- Doc?
Where you goin' with that shotgun?
I didn't know you was back in town.
Well, well.
How the hell are you?
Wyatt, I am rolling. Morgan.
- Doc.
- Virgil.
'Lo, Doc.
Wyatt Earp?
Going into business for ourselves, Doc.
Wyatt just got us a faro game.
Since when is faro a business?
Didn't you always say that gambling's an honest trade?
No. I said poker's an honest trade.
Only suckers buck the tiger.
The odds are all on the house.
Depends on how you look at it.
I mean, it's not like anybody's puttin' a gun to their head now, is it?
That's what I love about Wyatt.
He can talk himself into anything.
Oh. Johnny, I apologise.
I forgot you were there.
You may go now.
Just leave that shotgun.
Leave it.
Thank you.
- Sheriff Behan!
- Gentlemen!
Sheriff, have you met Doc Holliday?
Piss on you, Wyatt.
Mr Holliday.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
- So, how's our little town suit you?
- Fine. Fine.
You know, I was thinking, what this town could really use is a racetrack.
Really? That's not a bad idea.
Send a signal we're growin' up.
Way ahead of yourselves, aren't you, boys?
This is just another mining camp.
Have you seen how everyone dresses?
Awful tony for a mining camp.
No sir, the die is cast. We are growin'.
Be as big as San Francisco in a few years, and just as sophisticated.
You son of a bitch!
Easy, gents! It's a private affair!
Don't raise that iron.
I don't wanna have to...
I'll kill you, you cheatin' son of a...
Very cosmopolitan.
I know him. That's Creek Johnson.
Wyatt? Doc?
- Jack.
- What do you say, old friend?
What the hell's that all about, Creek?
He crawfished a bet and called me a liar.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of fellow sophisticates.
Turkey Creek Jack Johnson,
Texas Jack Vermillion.
Watch your ear, Creek.
- Afraid I'll have to have those guns.
- It was a fair fight. We was legal.
I'm sorry, boys.
I gotta take you before Judge Spicer.
Hand 'em over.
Law and order every time, that's us.
I'm frightfully thirsty.
Well, we made it safe and sound.
Sheriff, what kinda town is this?
Nice scenery.
Well, an enchanted moment.
Interesting little scene.
I wonder who that tall drink of water is.
My dear, you have set your gaze upon the quintessential frontier type.
Note the lean silhouette, eyes closed by the sun, though sharp as a hawk.
He's got the look of both predator and prey.
I want one.
Happy hunting.
Hey there, sister boy!
Please, sister boy, gimme some!
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- Leave him alone, Barnes!
Billy, sit with me.
This is so much fun. We haven't been to a show since years.
I hope they're good.
- Wyatt?
- Oh, sorry.
Darlin', you know the Earps.
Kate, how you been?
Mattie, ravishin'.
Doc.
Wyatt, I'd like ya to meet Mayor Clum and his wife.
- Mr Earp.
- Mayor.
Your reputation precedes you.
- I was wondering if you might be...
- Not a prayer. Nice meetin' you.
Professor Gillman? Oh, I seen him in Bisbee. He catches stuff.
Hey, Professor, catch this.
They're shooting at us!
They're actually shooting at us.
At least we won't have to wait for our notices.
Prettiest man I ever saw.
Ladies and gentlemen, the St Crispin's Day speech from Henry V.
To set the scene...
- Goddamn, Barnes!
- Almost shot my damn ear off.
"If we are marked to die,
"we are now to do our country loss.
"But if to live, the fewer men, the greater share of honour."
He's got some nerve, I'll say that.
What d'ya think there, Billy Nilly?
I think he's wonderful.
"...gentle his condition.
"Gentlemen in England now abed shall think themselves accurs'd
"they were not here,
"and hold their manhoods cheap
"whilst any speaks who fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day."
That's great! That's our kinda stuff!
Play it again!
Now what in the hell is this?
That's Faust.
He's gonna make a deal with the devil.
Is your soul for sale, dear?
Know what I'd do?
I'd take a deal and then crawfish and drill that old devil in the ass.
How 'bout you, Juanito?
What would you do?
I already did it.
Very instructive.
But who was the devil?
I'll be damned.
You may indeed, if you get lucky.
Would you look at all those stars?
I mean, you look up and you think,
"God made all of that?
"He still remembered to make a little speck like me."
Kinda flattering, really.
Wyatt, do you believe in God?
- No, come on, really. Do ya?
- Yeah. Maybe. Hell, I don't know.
Well, what d'you think happens when you die?
Somethin'. Nothin'. Hell, I don't know.
Well, I read this book, a book on spiritualism.
Oh, God, here he goes again.
Said that a lot of people when they die, they see this light.
- Like in a tunnel.
- Yeah?
They say it's the light leadin' you to heaven.
Really?
Well, what about hell?
They got a sign there, or what?
Hey, Wyatt, goddamn it.
- I'm serious.
- Hey, Morg.
Comin' to the Oriental, Virg?
- Well.
- Not tonight.
Tonight, me and my old man are gonna have some fun.
Come on, get movin', old man.
Maiden name was Sullivan.
Well, you better go with them, honey.
I gotta go to work.
Please stay with me.
Well, honey, I gotta get to work.
All right. All right.
Well, wait a minute.
I guess I don't have to go right now. I...
- I could stay awhile.
- No, no. I don't wanna keep you.
No, really, I can stay awhile.
That the bottle Lou gave you?
Yes, it is.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Wyatt, it's just headaches.
I know what I'm doing.
No, I don't need to see a doctor!
- All right, honey. Okay.
- Just go.
Everything's fine, Wyatt.
- Work well.
- All right, good night.
You look beautiful tonight.
Thank you.
- Night, Mattie.
- Good night, Morgan.
Come on.
I want to match seven, seven stinkin' spades.
- Let's go.
- I'm your man.
You win again. Well played, sir.
You are on fire.
- I told you, I'm burnin' up tonight.
- Loser on the ace.
I'll take the red seven, and I got some deeds here.
- I'll take seven stinkin' diamonds.
- Awful lot of money.
You can't stand the heat, pal, get out of the kitchen.
You're the doctor.
Sad news, friend, you lose.
- So, now we're in the mining business.
- You're the one, Wyatt.
We're turnin' into regular tycoons.
Think I'll call this one the Mattie Blaylock.
Mattie'd get a kick outta that one.
- That's her maiden name.
- And what a maiden.
- Pure as the driven snow, I'm sure.
- Hey, Doc, come on now.
It's just his style, Morg.
He doesn't mean anything.
Tell me something, my friend.
I'm curious.
Do you actually consider yourself a married man, forsaking all others?
Yeah, pretty much.
I mean, I was no angel when we met, but neither was she.
People can change, Doc.
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.
I see.
And what would you do, if she walked in here?
- "She"?
- You know damn well who I mean.
That dusky-hued lady satan, that's who.
- Oh, I'd probably ignore her.
- Ignore her?
I'd ignore her. People can change, Doc.
I'll remember you said that.
What?
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Ma'am? Miss Marcus?
Aw, hell.
Bravo!
Miss Marcus, allow me the pleasure of a drink.
- Thank you, sir.
- Milt, champagne!
Satisfied?
I stand corrected, Wyatt. You're an oak.
Thanks, Kate.
Mr Fabian.
- Well done.
- Well done.
Good show, partner, good show.
Mr Fabian, would you come sit at my table?
Mr Earp, would you mind signing an autograph for me, sir?
My wife's not gonna believe this.
Wyatt Earp, huh? Heard of you.
Listen now, Mr Kansas Law Dog.
Law don't go around here. Savvy?
- I'm retired.
- Good.
That's real good.
Yeah. Yeah, that's real good, law dog,
'cause lawjust don't go around here.
Yeah, I heard you the first time.
Winner to the king. $500.
- Shut up, Ike.
- You must be Doc Holliday.
That's the rumour.
You retired too?
Not me. I'm in my prime.
Yeah, you look it.
You must be Ringo.
Look, darlin', Johnny Ringo, the deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.
What do you think, darlin', should I hate him?
- You don't even know him.
- No. That's true, but...
I don't know, there's just somethin' about him.
Somethin' 'round the eyes.
I don't know.
Reminds me of...
Me.
No. I'm sure of it, I hate him.
He's drunk.
Come on, boys, we don't want any trouble in here, not in any language.
That's Latin, darlin'.
Evidently, Mr Ringo's an educated man.
Now I really hate him.
Watch it, Johnny.
I hear he's real fast.
Come on. Go, Johnny.
Bravo!
Drinks are on me!
Gettin' kinda spooky around here.
Curly Bill, huh?
- Who was that other idiot?
- Ike Clanton.
- Table's open!
- The man dealing faro, who is he?
That's Wyatt Earp. Made a name for himself as a peace officer in Kansas.
Peace officer.
Very impressive.
I believe he's married.
More champagne?
Oh, hell.
- Hello.
- Hello.
We've never actually met.
My name is...
Wyatt Earp. Yes, I know.
- I'm...
- Josephine Marcus.
Everybody knows.
I was beginning to think we'd never meet.
This is fortuitous. That means "lucky."
Yeah, I know what it means.
- Easy now.
- What is it?
That mare is in season.
Bet she's starting.
- How do they know?
- They know. It's the scent.
Well, I guess we'd better split 'em up.
It's been real...
I have a better idea.
Let's run it out of them.
Yeah, I'm an oak, all right.
Well, end of the road.
Maybe for you.
That was lovely.
Lovely? You could've been killed back there, or busted up.
Fun, though, wasn't it?
- You'd die for fun?
- Wouldn't you?
Oh, he's laughing.
I didn't think you ever laughed.
Yeah, I laugh sometimes.
Yes, but how often? Are you happy?
Am I happy? Well, I don't know.
I'm happy as the next man, I guess.
I don't laugh all day long like an idiot, if that's what you mean.
- Touchy about it, aren't you?
- No, I'm not touchy. I'm just...
It's a silly question, is all.
"Am I happy? Are you happy?"
Are you happy?
Oh, I'm always happy, unless I'm bored.
That blonde woman, is that your wife?
- What about her?
- Nothing.
What do you want out of life?
- How do you get these questions?
- Just answer.
I don't know!
Make some money, I guess.
- Maybe have some children.
- Doesn't suit you.
- Well, how would you know?
- It just doesn't, that's all.
I oughta know my own mind, and I'm telling you what suits me is a family and kids.
Suits me right down to the ground.
In fact, that's my idea of heaven.
All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Room service.
Oh, he's laughing again.
Well, that's what I want.
I wanna move and go places and never look back.
Just have fun, forever.
That's my idea of heaven.
Need someone to share it with, though.
You mean Behan.
Well, then...
Why are you with him?
Because he's handsome and he's charming and...
He's all right. For now.
Oh, I know, don't say it, I'm rotten.
I've tried to be good. It's just so boring.
The way you talk.
Never heard a woman talk like that?
Never.
I don't have time to be proper.
I wanna live.
I'm a woman. I like men.
If that means I'm not ladylike, then I guess I'm just not a lady.
- At least I'm honest.
- You're different.
There's no arguin' that.
But you're a lady, all right.
I'll take my oath on it.
Come on! Giddap!
Is that the opium Lou gave you?
It's a new bottle, isn't it?
You better go easy on that stuff.
Wyatt, leave me alone.
- And where've you been?
- Just out. Ridin'.
How're you feelin', Mattie?
I don't know.
I'm all right.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
Well, I was thinkin' today, we've already made a pile of money in this place.
If we pulled up stakes and just moved on, you know, then we could stay on the move, keep goin', see the world.
Just live on room service for the rest of our lives.
How'd that be?
Room service?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Nothin'. I just...
Just thinkin' out loud, and you know I...
Nothin'.
Forget about it.
What's she doin' with that lunger?
Hey.
Is that Old Dog Tray?
That sounds like Old Dog Tray to me.
Pardon?
You know, Stephen Foster.
Oh! Susanna.
Camptown Races.
Stephen stinkin' Foster!
Yes, well, this happens to be a nocturne.
- A which?
- You know,
Frederic fucking Chopin.
Oh, yeah.
Boy, I feel great.
I feel just capital.
Do you see what's going on in the street?
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- I believe you're the sheriff.
No, no. This is not county business.
This is a town matter. Marshal?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do somethin'.
Here's your down card.
Curly Bill!
Come on now.
Well, howdy, Fred.
Hand those over, Curly. Hand 'em over.
Why, sure, dad.
I'm only funnin'.
Here you go.
Fred?
Come on now. Fred?
- Got ol' Fred White!
- Hey, he shot the marshal! Everybody!
Better get him off the street.
Fred White's dead! They killed him.
They killed Fred White!
- All right, back off.
- Get a rope! String him up!
- Nobody's hangin' anybody.
- He just killed a man!
Then he'll stand trial for it.
Now get back! Move!
Turn him loose!
He said to turn loose of him.
Well, I'm not. So go home.
I swear to God, law dog, you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
All right, you die first. Get it?
Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe. You understand me?
- He's bluffin'. Let's rush him.
- No, he ain't bluffin'.
You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.
- Now tell them to get back.
- Go on now, get back.
Go on! Billy!
He'll kill me.
And you, music lover, you're next.
It's the drunk piano player.
You're so drunk, you can't hit nothin'.
In fact, you're probably seein' double.
I have two guns, one for each of ya.
All right, break it up now!
Go home now!
I'll see you soon.
- I'll see you soon.
- We'll meet again.
Well, as you can see, never a dull moment.
So it takes Judge Spicer three weeks to get back to town, and he says,
"Well, did you actually see it?"
I said, "No. By the time I got there,
Marshal White had already been shot."
Then Spicer leans forward and he says,
"Well, can't have a murder without a witness."
- What?
- Case dismissed. Can you beat it?
After all that? Aw, hell, who cares?
None of my business anyway.
There you go, Milt.
God, I love this game!
You know, boys, when we're finally set, we gotta each have a billiard room in our houses.
I been thinkin', maybe we oughta open up a place of our own. You know?
There's the real money. Build it up, milk it for all it's worth, then sell it off for a bundle, and breeze outta this burg with more money than Croesus and ready to live like kings.
What d'ya think, Virg?
Virg? Why don't you and me take a walk around town and see if we can't spot us out a couple of nice lots?
It's workin' out just like you said, Wyatt.
Goddamn, boys, we're lootin' this burg six ways from Sunday.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Financially, yeah, I gotta admit.
Excuse me.
Wyatt, do you have a moment?
- Please, will you just hear me out?
- Now hold on, Mayor.
He already told you no.
You tell him, Morg.
What about you? You were a lawman.
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Sorry, Mayor, but you're barkin' up the wrong tree.
You know, you men are makin' a lot of money in this town.
That's good. That's good.
Good for you.
In the meantime, a lot of decent people are suffering.
But, please, don't let me take up any more of your precious time.
Rack 'em.
I tell ya, I'm suffering.
From a hangover.
Stop that!
- Stop.
- No.
Hold on a minute! Wait a minute!
- Calm down and listen to me!
- Yeah, let him speak!
Nobody's sayin' you can't own a gun.
Nobody's even sayin' you can't carry a gun.
All we're sayin' is you can't carry a gun in town.
That's not so bad, is it?
Listen, Mayor, I have to talk to you about this.
No, we don't have to talk.
You can read, can't you?
It's a town matter, not county.
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you we weren't gettin' involved.
You got us involved when you brought us here.
Now you hold on a minute, Virg.
Hold on nothin'! I walk around this town and look these people in the eye.
It's just like someone's slappin' me in the face.
These people are afraid to walk down the street, and I'm tryin' to make money off that like some goddamn vulture!
If we're gonna have a future in this town, it's gotta have some law and order.
Please, Virg, don't do this to me!
It's got nothin' to do with you!
It's got to do with...
Nothin' to do with me?
I'm your brother, for Christ's sake!
God, I don't believe this!
Talk to him, will you? Or hit him!
Ah, God, don't tell me!
Like you said, Wyatt, we're brothers.
Gotta back your brother's play.
Just did like I figured you would.
All right now, you listen to me, both of ya!
For the first time in our lives, we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family.
This is trouble we don't need.
You saw what happened to Fred White.
We know what we're doin', Wyatt.
Okay, fine. Say you're right, say you don't get yourself killed.
There's somethin' else.
All those years I worked those cow towns,
I was only ever mixed up in one shootin', just one.
But a man lost his life, and I took it.
You don't know how that feels, Morg.
Believe me, boy, you don't ever wanna know.
Not ever.
Didn't even make a dent, did I?
All right.
You're both makin' a big mistake.
Do you wanna ante?
Yeah, fine.
What do you think of the singer?
Nice voice.
Wyatt, Doc won't quit.
He's been at it for 36 hours straight.
Clanton and the McLaury Brothers came in an hour ago.
I tried to get him to go to bed, but he won't let go.
I know, and nobody can make him.
Wyatt, just in time. Pull up a chair.
Doc, you been hittin' it awful hard, haven't ya?
Nonsense.
I've not yet begun to defile myself.
I was wonderin' if maybe you wouldn't wanna go on over to the Crystal Palace.
I will not be pawed at, thank you very much.
- I'm sorry.
- That's right.
Doc can go on day and night, and then some.
That's my loving man.
Have another one, my loving man.
I'm in.
Hey.
Loving man, you been called.
What is that now?
That 12 hands in a row, Holliday?
Son of a bitch, nobody's that lucky.
Why, Ike, whatever do you mean?
Take it easy, boys.
Maybe poker's just not your game, Ike.
I know, let's have a spelling contest.
How 'bout if I just wring your scrawny neck?
Enough, Ike.
Are you takin' his part?
I'm the one who got cheated!
You goddamn pimps!
You're all in it together.
Nobody's in anything, Ike.
You're drunk.
Go on home and sleep it off.
Get your goddamn hands off me!
Don't you ever put your hands on me, see?
Don't you ever try to manhandle a Cowboy,
'cause we'll cut your goddamn pimp's heart out.
You understand, you pimp?
Don't you threaten me, you little son of a bitch!
All right! All right!
Come on, easy, Virg, easy!
You just go on home and forget about it, huh, Ike?
Come on, Virg.
I ain't gonna forget nothin'.
Well, that certainly was a bust.
Come, darlin'. Let's seek our entertainment elsewhere.
Forget it, Virg. Go on.
Get some fresh air.
- What's wrong, Doc?
- Nothin'. Not a thing.
I'm right as the mail.
Doc? Doc!
All right, get him up.
Let's get him to the hotel.
- What's wrong with him?
- Lunger.
Yeah, well, I hope you die.
Give me my guns.
My rifle.
Goddamn bastards.
Think they can cheat me.
Nobody cheated you, Ike.
Just go home.
I don't take no mouth from no bartenders, neither.
There, ya see?
Give somebody a rap on the beezer, get some respect around here.
You tell the Earps, I see 'em on the street and Doc Holliday,
I'm gonna send them to hell on a shutter. You tell 'em that.
Pick these guns up.
Come on.
Come on, Ike.
Come on!
- Hey, you walkin'?
- Leave me alone.
- You gonna give Ike back his guns.
- Not till he sobers up.
Wearin' that badge don't make you right.
Who the hell you think you are?
Watch the way you walk, you stupid bastard.
Easy, kid, I'm sorry.
I ain't easy and I ain't your kid.
You take your sorry and shove it up your ass.
I'll fight you right now.
Goddamn it!
You're gonna bleed.
You got a fight comin'. Comin' today.
Bastards! It's comin'!
Your condition's quite advanced.
I'd say you lost some 60% of your lung tissue, maybe more.
What's the verdict?
Two years. Two days.
Hard to say. If you stop now.
Your smokin', your drinkin', your gamblin', your nightlife.
You need complete rest.
What I mean is, you must attempt to deny
- your marital impulse.
- Get out of my sight.
- How are you feeling, Doc?
- Better.
That's good.
I knew it wasn't nothing.
We must talk, darlin'.
It appears we must redefine the nature of our association.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc.
Don't I always take care of ya?
Nobody cares for you like me.
I'm a good woman.
Yes, it's true, you are a good woman.
Then again, you may be the Antichrist.
Goddamn.
Now there's six of 'em.
Hell, this is like a bad dream.
Just stay calm. Use your head.
It'll be all right.
Just the same, though, guess maybe you better swear me in.
Those Cowboys been telling everybody in town they're gonna clean you out.
They're back there in that lot behind the O.K. Corral.
- Thank you, Mayor.
- What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?
What in the hell's goin' on?
Five people come up to my room tellin' me the Clantons and McLaurys are gunnin' for us.
We goin' down there or not?
What are we gonna do?
Wait till the liquor wears off.
Soon as they start gettin' headaches, they'll lose interest.
Lose interest, hell.
They're threatenin' our lives.
- You'll never make that stick.
- They're carryin' guns, Wyatt.
Christ's sake, Virg, that's a misdemeanour.
You go down there and arrest them, something goes wrong, maybe this time somebody really gets his head broken.
You'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for trouble from here to Christmas.
You want to risk all that over a misdemeanour?
Damn right I'll risk it.
They're breakin' the law.
It's not your problem, Doc.
You don't have to mix up in this.
That is a hell of a thing for you to say to me.
All right, Virg.
Your call. Give Doc the shotgun.
They'll be less apt to get nervy if he's on the street howitzer.
Go on! Get home!
Goddamn kid.
How the hell did we get ourselves into this?
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I just went over there and disarmed them.
You did? Come on, boys.
Gentlemen, I'm not gonna allow any trouble.
We're here to disarm you.
Throw up your hands.
Hold it! That's not what I want!
Oh, my God.
Billy! Billy!
Stop! No! No!
Don't shoot! I got no gun!
Please don't shoot me! I got no gun!
This fight's commenced!
Get to fightin' or get away!
- That's it!
- Shut the door!
Give me your goddamned gun!
Damn it!
Billy! Billy!
Doc, behind us!
I got you now, you son of a bitch.
You're a daisy if you do.
Morgan, hold quiet now.
Here you go. Easy. Easy, man.
- I got you. All right.
- All right!
All of you are under arrest.
I don't think I'll let you arrest us today, Behan.
Virg!
Virgil!
Well, I guess we did our good deed for today, Mayor.
You were right.
It's nothin' like I thought.
- I almost wish that...
- I know, Morgan.
I know. Me too.
Outta the way!
Gettin' warmer.
Guess spring's comin'.
Hello, Billy. I say hello.
It's deputy!
And I don't want to talk to you!
Those men you killed were my friends.
I'm just a nothin'.
But if I wasn't, I'd fight you right now, so I don't want to talk to you.
All they ever did was laugh at him.
Sister boy should've stuck around.
- What do you want, Ringo?
- I want your blood.
And I want your souls.
And I want 'em both right now.
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Well, ya got trouble!
And it starts with you.
I'm not gonna fight you, Ringo.
There's no money in it.
Sober up. Come on, boys.
You wretched slugs.
Don't any of ya have the guts to play for blood?
I'm your huckleberry.
That's just my game.
All right, lunger. You go to hell.
- I'll put you out of your misery.
- Say when.
- Johnny, don't!
- No, Johnny!
- Get off!
- Easy now!
- Get off!
- It ain't nothin'.
Don't mind him!
He's just drunk, that's all.
Cool down, Johnny!
No! No!
I want them spittin' blood!
Easy, son, easy! Now ain't the time!
Slow down, Ringo.
I tell ya, boys, even I'm worried what's gonna happen once Ringo runs this outfit.
God have mercy!
- Juanito, their time will come.
- Gentlemen.
- Let's go get bullied, boy!
- Let's go get soused!
- Barber.
- Yes, sir?
Proceed, sir.
Listen to me. I need to speak with you.
Not now. I'm busy.
I see what's going on between you and Wyatt.
I'm not a fool. But listen to me.
Lots of so-called hard cases and tough nuts come and go around this town, but none of them has a clue about the real play, none of them.
Now after tonight, there'll be one man in charge of Tombstone.
You'll be happy to know him. Bet on it.
Gonna be one of those nights.
It's gettin' late, boys.
I'm gonna go to bed.
- Good night, Virg.
- Good night, Morg.
Bundle up, Virg.
It's gettin' cold out there.
Yeah.
Tower of Babel.
Death and the Devil.
Oh, dear.
Oh, Allie. I wish you'd learn to play a real card game.
- More tea, Mattie?
- No, no.
- Are you all right, Mattie?
- Yes.
- Are you expecting someone?
- Only Virg.
Please. I know it's awful to come here, but listen.
I think something's gonna happen tonight.
It's Virg.
No! Get down!
That thunder's sure gettin' close.
Virgil. What'd ya forget?
Wyatt.
Will you hurry with that water, please?
Come on, Lou.
Wyatt! Wyatt!
They hit Clum's house too, shot up his wife.
His wife! Whoever heard of that?
They're bugs, Wyatt. All that smart talk about live and let live.
There ain't no live and let live with bugs.
All right, you listen to me now.
We gotta get out of here.
Get out of here?
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.
Lie down and crawl or you might get hurt? What kind of talk is that?
- Do you see what's happening here?
- What?
What do you mean?
What are you saying?
No. Please, no.
I'm afraid your husband's going to lose the use of his arm.
Oh, God, no.
Don't worry, Allie girl.
I still got one good arm to hold you with.
Goddamn!
- Goddamn sons of bitches!
- Morgan, wait a minute! Virg.
- You had to be so damn smart.
- I'm sorry, Allie.
I told you, Virg.
- Not now, Wyatt.
- All right.
All right, what do you want me to do?
- Just leave me alone, for God's sakes.
- Virg...
He doesn't want to talk now, Wyatt!
I heard about what they did to your women. That was wrong.
I'm here to let you know that it wasn't me. I had no part of it.
No? Brothers to the bone, right, McMasters?
No. Not any more. Not after this night.
He's right, Wyatt. You want us for anything, we're with you.
Come on.
Hold him!
No! Get her out of here! Jesus!
Somebody shut that dog up!
I said hold him, goddamn it!
Somebody get that goddamn dog out of here!
The bullet's too deep. I can't get it out.
The way it's lodged in there. I'm sorry.
Easy, Morg. Is that better?
Yeah.
You were right, Wyatt.
They got me good.
Don't let 'em get you, brother.
You're the one.
Easy, Morg.
Don't worry about that now.
Remember what I said about seein' a light when you're dyin'?
Yeah. Yeah.
That ain't true.
I can't see a damn thing.
Morg?
Morg!
Morg?
No.
Morgan! No!
Morgan, don't die! I love you!
Don't die!
Why? Why him?
- No. No, get away from me!
- Wyatt!
Can't you see? Get away from me!
Morgan!
And so she walked out of our lives forever.
I want you to know it's over.
Well.
Bye.
You smell that, Bill?
Smells like someone died.
Jesus, Johnny.
Ike.
Take Stillwell and finish it.
Now, you take care of yourself.
- That's Virgil with the women.
- He's mine!
- All aboard!
- Hey, Mattie! Where's Wyatt?
Right behind you, Stillwell.
No!
Sweet Jesus. Don't shoot.
All right, Clanton.
You called down the thunder.
Well, now you got it.
You see that?
It says "United States Marshal."
Wyatt. Please don't kill me. Please.
Take a good look at him, Ike,
'cause that's how you're gonna end up.
The Cowboys are finished.
You understand me?
I see a red sash,
I kill the man wearin' it.
So run, you cur.
Run! Tell all the other curs the law is comin'!
You tell 'em I'm comin'!
And Hell's comin' with me, you hear?
Hell's comin' with me!
Nobody move!
Nonsense. By all means, move.
Get down!
Hey, Wyatt!
How the hell are ya?
I got some boys over there behind ya!
Got you in a little crossfire.
How do ya like that?
Come on!
Think of something fast, would ya?
Wyatt? Hey, Wyatt.
- No.
- Wyatt!
- No.
- Wyatt, what are you doin'?
Look at that.
Yeah.
Come and get some, boy.
No! Let me!
No.
- Son of a bitch.
- No!
Jesus Christ!
No. No!
Did you ever see anything like that before?
Hell, I ain't never even heard of anything like that.
Nothin'.
Where is he?
Down by the creek, walkin' on water.
Well, let's hope he's got another miracle up his sleeve.
'Cause if I know Ringo, he's headed straight for us.
Well, if they were my brothers,
I'd want revenge too.
No. Make no mistake.
It's not revenge he's after.
It's a reckoning.
Doc. You ought to be in bed. What the hell you doin' this for anyway?
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hell, I got lots of friends.
I don't.
My God.
- Are you all right?
- What do you care?
It was your friends that did it.
Must've been Claiborne and Fuller.
They left here last night.
Oh, no.
They tried to take my watch.
He cursed them for cowards, and they shot him.
I don't understand any of this.
I just know it's ugly.
You're all ugly, and he was beautiful.
He tried to bring something fine into your ugly world, and you shot him for it.
Not that you care.
- Billy. Where you goin'?
- I'm not goin' with you.
Billy! Billy, get back here!
I'm sorry, sir, but we got to have some law.
- Billy!
- Let him go. Who cares?
Get on out!
Get the hell outta here! Go on!
Party's over, boys. Let's go!
Halt.
Ringo and Behan are out in front.
There is about 30 of 'em.
They're all wearin' badges.
Christ.
We gotta find a place to hole up.
Doc.
Grab him.
I got him.
I got him!
Is this Henry Hooker's ranch?
That's right. And I'm Hooker.
We got a sick man.
And our horses are done in.
Put him up at my place, as long as it's just tonight.
We're in debt to you.
I know you boys have got to keep movin', but he looks pretty bad to me.
They got held up, and their boss actor got killed.
They came here to water the horses, then they'll push on.
I'm sorry about your friend.
And I'm sorry that I...
I forgave you the moment you said it.
You did? Well...
Thank you.
All set.
I have to go.
Wait.
What the hell is that?
They got McMasters!
Ringo wanted to make sure he got your attention, Marshal!
He wants a straight-up fight, just you and him, to settle this thing once and for all.
Oak grove at the mouth of Silver Springs Canyon, 7:00!
You tell him I'll be there!
- Are you crazy?
- I'll be there!
It's not finished.
After I'm done with Wyatt Earp, take your Cowboys and finish off
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack.
You burn 'em, Ike.
Burn 'em all.
Hell, Johnny, he ain't even gonna show.
He'll show.
I spent my whole life not knowin' what I wanted outta life, just chasin' my tail.
Now for the first time
I know exactly what I want, and who.
And that's the damnable misery of it.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?
What makes him do the things he does?
A man like Ringo got a great empty hole right through the middle of him.
He can never kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it.
What does he need?
Revenge.
For what?
Bein' born.
It all happened so fast with Curly Bill
I didn't really have time to think about it, but I've had plenty of time to think about this.
I can't beat him, can I?
No.
Wait. I'm goin' with ya.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Wyatt.
It's all right, Doc.
What's it like to wear one of those?
Don't worry.
They want him, they gotta come over us first.
He's waitin' for you by the big oak, quarter mile up that trail.
They're not givin' ya any safe-conduct.
Shootin' starts, you better kick east to the New Mexico line.
I ain't got the words.
I know.
Me neither.
Well.
I didn't think ya had it in you.
I'm your huckleberry.
Why, Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave.
Fight's not with you, Holliday.
I'll beg to differ, sir. We started a game we never got to finish.
Play for blood, remember?
I was just foolin' about.
I wasn't.
And this time it's legal.
All right, lunger. Let's do it.
Say when.
Come on. Come on!
Oh, Johnny. Come on!
You're no daisy. You're no daisy at all!
Poor soul.
You were just too high-strung.
I'm afraid the strain was more than he could bear.
Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I made out.
Good God.
My hypocrisy goes only so far.
All right.
Let's finish it.
Indeed, sir. The last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.
Come on! Get going!
Look at this!
Hello, Wyatt.
Father Feeney and I were just investigating the mysteries of the Church of Rome.
It appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds.
You're no hypocrite, Doc.
You just like to sound like one.
I brought you somethin'.
Well, let's see. Where are we today?
I'm $17 down to you.
- Two bits a hand. Stud?
- You keep comin' back here.
I told you not to, and I meant it.
You're the only person
I can afford to lose to any more.
How we feelin' today, Doc?
I'm dying. How are you?
Pretty much the same.
So now we add self-pity to your list of frailties.
All right, Doc.
All right, how many cards you want?
I don't want to play any more.
How many?
Damn you. You're the most fallible, stubborn, self-deluded, bull-headed man
I've ever known in my entire life.
I call.
- You win.
- Yet withal, you're the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope.
I was in love once.
My first cousin.
She was 15.
We were both so...
That's good, Doc.
That's good. What happened?
She joined a convent over the affair.
She was all I ever wanted.
What did you want?
Just to live a normal life.
There's no normal life, Wyatt.
There's just life.
Now get on with it.
Don't know how.
Sure you do. Say goodbye to me.
Go grab that spirited actress and make her your own.
Take that beauty and run, and don't look back.
Live every second.
Live right up to the hilt.
Live, Wyatt.
Live for me.
Wyatt, if you ever were my friend, if you ever had even the slightest feelin' for me, leave now.
Leave now.
Please?
Thanks for always bein' there, Doc.
I'll be damned.
This is funny.
I never thought I would see
Gilbert and Sullivan performed right here in Denver.
- Good night, Josie.
- Good night.
Good show.
Ya ever see the sun come up over the Rockies?
It hits all of a sudden, and below there's California.
And you swear you're lookin' at heaven.
I have nothing left, nothing to give you.
I have no pride, no dignity.
No money. I don't even know how we'll make a living, but...
I promise I'll love you the rest of your life.
Don't worry, Wyatt. My family's rich.
What shall we do first?
What you wanted to do the first night we met.
Remember?
May I have this dance?
- Yes.
- And then we'll have room service.
The power of the Cowboy Gang was broken forever.
Ike Clanton was shot and killed two years later during an attempted robbery.
Mattie died of a drug overdose shortly after she left Tombstone.
Virgil and Allie Earp moved to California, where Virgil, despite the use of only one arm, became a town sheriff.
Wyatt and Josephine embarked on a series of adventures.
Up or down, thin or flush, in 47 years they never left each other's side.
Wyatt Earp died in Los Angeles in 1929.
Among the pallbearers at his funeral were early Western movie stars
William S. Hart and Tom Mix.
Tom Mix wept.
Almost got hung myself once.
Didn't care for it much.
How about you?
We'll leave you now.
Don't want anyone to see me here... get the crazy notion that I was somehow connected with your... accidental death.
On the other hand... it's not good for a man to be out here alone.
The mind can do terrible things.
Enjoy the company.
Oh, snakes.
Don't go without me, all right, Ollie?
Lord... whatever I've done to piss you off... if you'd just get me out of this... let me know what it was,
I'll rectify the situation.
It had just been a shitty week for me from the beginning.
It all started when I was heading into Crystal River... to take some money from the bank.
I should've known there was bad luck on the horizon... when my horse got stolen... and I had to replace it with something less than a thoroughbred.
My luck had to change fast.
The poker game of the century was four days away in St. Louis... and I was still $3,000 short of the entrance fee.
There was no way in hell
I would miss that game.
Not just because there was a half-million dollar pot to be won... although that kind of money certainly demands attention... but because I needed to know how good I really was.
Once and for all.
I had to hole up here for the night.
Business would have to wait till morning.
Big fella.
- Hello, sir.
- Hi, son.
How much?
By the day, week or month?
No, no. Not how much to take care of him, how much to just take him. Permanently.
Pa! This man wants to know if you wanna buy a burro.
That burro ain't worth a dollar.
Well, sir,
I say you got yourself a deal.
Here's your dollar.
He doesn't eat much, but he's a regular jackass.
And he-aw, he-aw, he always likes to be called Arthur.
From the moment I slapped eyes on this hombre, I smelled trouble... and refried beans.
Something else told me that this was not just a chance meeting.
I'll see your 10 and I'll raise you 10.
I call.
- What do you got?
- Full house.
That beats me.
Damn. You are a lucky lady.
Is this seat taken?
It is now.
My name is Annabelle Bransford.
What do they call you?
Bret Maverick.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I like the game the way it is.
Well, I bring all sorts of pluses to the table.
I hardly ever bluff and I never, ever cheat.
I don't believe it.
Neither do I.
I like the game just the way it is.
What good is an empty chair?
Indeed.
I'll bet I can change your mind.
I promise that I will lose for at least an hour.
- I like that.
- Sounds good.
My kind of player.
We're playing five-card draw.
Please, sit down.
My name is
Mrs. Annabelle Bransford.
I caught that before, ma'am.
Except the "Mrs."
Ante up.
I'm in.
Same game. Chips, sir.
You can lose as much as you want.
Two hundred.
- You did say you'd lose for an hour.
- I'm a man of my word.
I know.
Place your bets.
It's about time.
I'll see you... and raise you 20.
Slow down,
I'm running low on chips.
I'll see your bet and...
I'll call.
Two pair. Aces over queens.
Lucky for me, I had 3 sixes.
Sorry.
Nice pot.
Broke your losing streak.
That one shouldn't count.
Beg your pardon?
I don't think that hand should count.
You got any logical reasons why not?
My mind wasn't on the game.
His mind wasn't on the...
What's your name, son?
- Johnny.
- You got a last name?
Johnny Hardin.
What's your occupation?
I'm a gunfighter.
I have to assume since you're still alive... and playing cards with us... that you're good at it.
Care to find out?
Gentlemen, this hand definitely does not count. Take it all.
Whatever you think's fair, and
I'll be content with the leavings.
You always been gutless?
I think so. For as long as I can remember, at any rate.
My old pappy used to say,
"He who fights and runs away... can run away another day."
What?
Look, I don't see...
Slow down there.
Where's the fire, son?
Slow down. Don't shoot me, okay?
I'm just trying to expound.
I was saying, I don't see what's so great about being brave.
I mean, I'm a card player.
You know, I play cards.
Call me a gambler.
I want to become an old gambler.
You are a gunfighter.
An exceptional one at that, from what I hear.
If I went up against you, what chance would I have had? Answer?
Zero.
Absolutely none whatsoever.
Wanna see it again?
Damn thing won't stay in the holster.
Whoop! I must have a spring in there.
Come on, let's just play poker.
Who wants to play poker?
Who wants to see someone get killed?
No. Let's play poker.
I'd rather be rich than dead.
Was that fast?
I thought that was fast.
Was it fast? Was it?
Yeah.
Now, what was it? Stud?
I think I prefer draw!
Just kidding.
Sorry. I couldn't resist it.
My ante's in.
- I'll raise you 75.
- Oh, 75.
Well, that's...
That more than takes care of your bet.
And I'll raise you whatever that is, looks like 100.
Shit! I fold.
Hey, you never paid to look...
You said you never bluffed.
I had a pair of aces!
No, I said I never cheated and I also said I hardly ever bluff.
This is one of the "hardlys."
You've been cheating the whole game.
What do you think I was doing during that first hour?
I was learning your tells.
Your weakness comes when you get your hand... shuffle the cards back and forth and act a little fidgety.
I just called you a cheat.
You also called me gutless... but I figured you were just teasing.
Get your hands off him!
We get him first!
When I seen you through the window,
I believed in the Almighty.
You were drinking.
A lot. And you played bad.
Whose fault is that?
Yours, you bastard!
It's all your fault!
It's our time now.
- I think there's gonna be a fight.
- Come here, son.
I want you to hold onto this for me.
If they get to whupping me... you have my permission to shoot me.
- Shoot you?
- Shoot me.
See this gets no dirt on it.
Thank you.
Good luck! I get to hold it.
I'm going to cut you up... fancy man!
- You're a pretty good fighter.
- Thank you.
- I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.
- Me too.
- By the way, I won 20 cents.
- Twenty cents?
Thanks to my lucky shirt.
Speaking of my 20 cents...
All right. All right! My shirt's damaged!
Damn!
What the hell else bad can happen? You!
What did you say before?
You called me something.
- Nothing important.
- He called you a gutless coward.
I did not say that. I might've said a gutless cheat...
- But not a coward.
- Cheat? Cheat?
I was teasing.
- Teasing?
- Teasing.
I don't like being teased.
Hey. My friend, I'm sorry.
Now I'm teasing you.
Let's play poker.
Oh, ma'am. Here. Let me get your chair.
That was truly amazing.
I just get lucky sometimes.
Whose deal was it? Mine?
Excuse me. Think I'm through with y'all for the evening.
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.
Good night, son.
Five-card draw all right?
Whatever.
Mind if I take six?
Little poker humor.
I'm just teasing you again.
Who is it?
Annabelle Bransford.
I shouldn't be doing this.
You're just standing in the hallway.
That's still legal in this state.
If only I weren't a married woman.
I couldn't help myself.
My very being cried out to hold you.
Stop by anytime.
I know we may never see each other again... so I think it's safe to say... you are the most... blindingly attractive man that I've ever seen.
Goodbye.
How can I possibly go on... without my wallet?
If you don't give back my money,
I'll have your ass in jail.
Damn!
Don't get mad at me. I can't help it if you're a miserable thief.
I'm a very good thief.
I just been having bad luck.
I know what that's all about.
Where're you from?
Your accent could use some work too.
- Most gentlemen enjoy my Southern.
- That's not in dispute.
But I'll bet there is no Mr. Bransford, is there?
No, and there never will be, thank you very much.
Now what do we do?
You're not going to turn me in, are you?
I am law-abiding.
It's my duty to turn you in.
I'm afraid I'll have to...
What the hell. I got my money back and there's no harm done.
Let's just call it square, shall we?
Damn!
What?
You're just so irritating and likable.
I have to work on that, I guess.
There you go, all likable again.
You know, I...
I think that had we known each other under different circumstances... we'd have hated each other.
There's no Mrs. Maverick?
I'm sure I would've remembered.
May I?
I wish we'd never met.
Goodbye.
She did it.
Son of a bitch.
Can I be of some help?
What?
You have to admit
I was much better the second time.
Not just better. You were good.
- I was?
- Very good.
Thank you.
And now it's time you do something I want.
How dare you? I'm a lady.
Not in a million years!
Not if you or I were 100 years old...
Shut up! I don't want to go to bed with you.
Why not?
Why not? I'd be too frightened!
If I dozed, God knows what parts of me you'd steal.
I'd wake up with all sorts of things missing.
But I don't know how to clean this... and, obviously, you must know how to.
The laundry's closed,
I leave early and you owe me.
Easy on the starch.
If I can't touch you,
I can touch your shirt and dream.
- Want a hand?
- Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
Good night, Bert.
Bret.
Bret. That's my name. Bret.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Is Eugene in?
- Yes, sir, but he's bus...
Eugene?
Get up, you bald-headed reprobate!
- On your feet!
- Don't shoot.
- I need some cash.
- I know a desert flower...
Shut up!
- Put the cash on the table.
- I don't have any.
Robbery!
Robert, no! It's all right.
It's my friend Bret saying hello.
- Tell everybody everything's okay.
- Yes, sir.
- Son of a bitch.
- Silly bastard.
- How are things going?
- Things couldn't be worse.
I know I owe you $1,000.
- That's what I came for.
- Would you take 100?
I've never welshed on a debt.
Give me to year's end.
The end of the?
I need that money right now.
Oh, for the?
For the poker championship, the All Rivers.
How much to enter?
Twenty-five thousand dollars.
I'm $3,000 short, but with Joseph and you...
Pork Chop Slim owed me... but his widow used the money for his funeral.
They never found the body.
- What?
- They never found his body.
The widow Pork Chop conned me.
What's with people nowadays?
I know. You can't trust them.
Take my last 100.
I can't.
What about Matilda and the kid?
- Bank robbery!
- I told you...
You heard him! Bank robbery!
I'll take this, gunslinger.
Empty your pockets, old man.
I got a silver dollar.
Do better!
My trigger finger's itchy.
All right, don't shoot, don't shoot.
- Take it.
- What? Look at this.
Well, I'll be. Jesus.
Hundreds and thousands.
- You said you were broke!
- I am now! He's got it.
- And I'll get the rest too!
- I don't have any more.
Pull those pockets out.
Turn around!
- Hurry up! Hey!
- I'm sorry.
Give me that!
- Nah.
- Nah.
Let's blow the safe!
- Light up!
- Heads down, everybody!
- I'm younger than you.
- I should be under...
I'm getting too old for this shit.
Hi-yah! Yah!
You sons of bitches beat me by a day!
Eugene!
You're holding out.
Bret, that's all I got left!
Maverick!
Hey!
Bret Maverick!
Nothing to worry about.
We want to talk to you, pal.
Where are you going?
Got you now!
- Anybody see you?
- Not a soul.
You fellas come in any later last night... that monster would've eaten me alive.
We saw that.
Anybody suspect anything?
Not a thing. You were great!
We enjoyed it.
No kidding.
Thanks for taking it easy on us.
Easy? Those were my best shots.
The one there rung my bell a little bit.
That's good.
You owe us $5 apiece.
- Five bucks.
- Damn right, $5 a beating.
You boys may or may not believe this.
They cleaned the bank and me out.
I'll have to owe you.
Are you saying... you don't have our money for taking your best shots?
- Killing me won't make you richer.
- Sure gonna make me feel better.
You got a point there.
Let's see here.
I'm sorry. I forgot!
I honestly forgot.
I always keep something pinned inside my vest... for such a rainy day occasion.
It's a good thing.
It was clouding up pretty quick.
That's a $100 bill.
- A $100 bill?
- But I do need some change.
- Eighty will be close enough, 75...
- Let's see what we got.
- I got 17 here.
- Seventeen dollars?
- That's right.
- You owe me $8 for a month.
- We'll settle that later.
- You always cheat me.
- I can't believe you!
- Close enough.
You came out better than you think. Nice working with you.
You keep this under your hats, okay?
News travels fast in the old West.
A $100 bill! That's...
25 apiece.
Ever since I was a kid,
I believed I had a gift.
That if I thought hard enough about a card...
I'd be able to cut straight to it.
My old pappy always said
I was a damn fool.
But I knew if I really believed and made it happen, then that... would be nothing short of magic.
Damn!
Of course, it didn't always work.
What do I expect?
In fact, it had never worked.
You sweet woman.
Lucky shirt. Yes.
Mrs. Bransford. Mrs. Bransford!
Wait! You!
Wait there. I'm... No! You...
Wait!
Hold up the ferry!
Don't go without me!
You did this on purpose.
You bet I did.
This is my lucky shirt.
Do your own laundry then.
My underwear comes from New York.
Got any idea where this shirt was made?
Paris, France, that's where!
I can't go to the nearest dry goods store to pick up another one!
Why don't you try the kiddie department?
Remove your hands from the lady.
When you least expect it, your hero arrives. Mister?
Zane Cooper.
Folks call me Coop.
- Suits me just fine.
- Coop.
This creature's named Maverick.
I'm Annabelle Bransford.
- I'll be taking this coach.
- So am I.
That ought to be fun.
Lord knows what that ruffian might've done had we been alone on the stage for two days.
I hope you can relax and enjoy the journey now.
My feeling is that if there weren't any women... none of us would be here.
What kind of sense does that make?
If there were no men, we wouldn't be here either.
Are you mocking me?
Don't get ruffled.
I was agreeing with you... in a totally unusual way.
What would this world come to without gentlemen like yourself?
A passenger! Come ahead.
Right this way, sir. Want a hand?
I'm the driver.
Are you all right?
Why does everybody ask me that?
Get me up there so we can get this thing going.
I think it's about time we get to know each other.
Mr. Maverick has aspirations to be a card player.
I'm not ignorant of cards.
Can't be in my line of work.
- And pray, what might that be?
- Lawman.
I bet you're the best there is.
I can tell things about a man.
I can't quite place your accent.
Where in the South are you from?
Ever been to Mobile?
That's where I'm from.
Mobile, Alabama?
Hell, I been there.
I'll bet we know the same people.
You start.
I've tried so hard to forget that place.
I endured such personal tragedy there.
A woman's suffering is not a funny thing, Bertie.
There are exceptions.
Watch your billfold.
Hey, old-timer!
The thief and the old guy find it bumpy back here!
How could you face them all down?
Nine men, all of them armed?
A man gives his word to do his job, he's honor bound to do it.
- Weren't you afraid?
- A mite.
Maverick doesn't believe in bravery.
I think bravery's a fine thing... just overrated is all, and doesn't suit me personally.
- I just realized something.
- What's that?
You're spineless.
That's right.
It's kept me alive a long time.
You fellas got a problem?
Heavens to Betsy, no!
What's the joke?
- You, Pancho. You're the joke.
- Explain that.
You'll have to pay us more money than Maverick did.
He paid you to fall down?
Paid us good too.
That's right. A $100 bill.
- That's a good day's work.
- That's right.
You fellas ought to see me first.
I'd have let you fall down for free.
Maverick is mine, anyway.
But this time it's personal.
Hundred dollar bill. Ha!
Is he taking a short cut?
Hey, old-timer, wake up!
Wake...
- Is he asleep?
- It's more serious than that.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
Yeah.
- Get up and stop the stage.
- Me? I just put a fresh shirt on.
- You stop the stage!
- Because this wheel's loose.
If it comes off, we're all dead.
Stop the stage.
- I'll take care of the wheel.
- All right.
- Give me your hat.
- It better fit when I come back.
Now, Bert, stop playing around and stop those horses.
- Help!
- This is serious!
- He'll be fine. He looks handy.
- He is?
- Why don't you fix the wheel?
- The wheel is perfect.
Then help him.
He'll kill you when he gets back.
No, in the long run, he'll thank me in his prayers.
What's he doing back there?
Sorry!
- Stop fooling around!
- You poked me in the eye!
Get up there and stop the horses!
Horses! Stop!
Stop!
- Let me help you.
- I got it.
Here.
So, what's with the wheel?
- Oh! It's fine.
- Nothing was wrong with it. It...
I know. I got a real good... close look at the wheels from underneath.
Don't you feel better about yourself for being so brave?
- Wasn't that exciting?
- I get it.
This was all for my benefit.
- Yes!
- To help me build character.
- Exactly.
- He's bursting with pride.
That's funny.
You'd think I'd be mad, wouldn't you?
Give me your hand.
Don't you ever try and help me again.
You either.
Now back off.
Go ahead, back off!
Go away.
Ungrateful.
Help.
What?
Help.
What did you say?
Please help me.
Oh! Okay, take my hand.
You take my hand.
Take my other hand.
- Easy.
- Oh, watch the cactus!
I don't care about it.
Just get me up there.
You're doing good.
Now get your hands off me!
Ungrateful.
Somebody ought to say something nice about the deceased.
How do we know he was nice?
We don't know anything about him.
The only thing in his wallet is names of whorehouses.
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch
Like me
"Don't let Maverick reach the game."
Trouble.
Pull up!
We sing praises unto the Lord, our God!
Here.
We'll do everything we can.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
Maverick!
- They got hit by Indians.
- Yeah, they were Injuns.
Ma'am, it was not Indians.
I seen them.
They were wearing war paint...
If it was Indians...
I said we'd take them to Cristal City.
- That's backtracking.
- Just a day.
- I have a game to get to.
- I know what you have to get to.
- Took my girl's music box.
- My favorite!
And the wagon with our money.
Hold it. Simmer down. Simmer down.
Exactly how much money?
- What kind of animal are you?
- Vulture.
Exactly how much money?
Thirty thousand dollars.
We were starting a mission.
If I get it back, is it worth 10 percent to you?
Five. Five percent.
No, 10 percent, Mary Margaret.
I want my wedding dress back... for when I find a husband.
All right. Can you do it?
- I know we can.
- What's this "we" stuff? Ma'am.
I'll give you 10 percent, but make those savages suffer.
I'm telling you, there are no hostile Indians around here.
Oh, my God! Come on...
Drums.
Those are definitely drums.
Right again, Bert.
It's Bret.
- Well?
- They may look like dimples in dirt to you.
But they're shod horse tracks. Indians don't shoe their ponies. So it wasn't Indians.
They're Indians.
They probably stole the ponies.
- Not everybody's like you.
- What is it with you and Indians?
Nothing. I try to shoot one a day. If possible, before noon. How about you, Coop?
It's their fault for being on our land before we got here.
- What are you doing here?
- We're partners. 50-50.
Sounds like 50-50 to me.
You want 50% too?
I want those ladies to get their money.
Oh, fine!
I don't split my bounty with anybody.
Would 60-40 be agreeable?
- What'll you do for your 40 percent?
- I'll help.
Oh.
Seventy-thirty?
Now, Mrs. Bransford, 70-30,
I don't know.
You're not exactly an experienced tracker.
Some tracker you are, following horses. Anybody can do that.
Anybody? Oh... you see that hawk?
- No!
- I won't shoot the hawk.
- You know what that hawk means?
- What?
Nothing. But you didn't know that.
- I did!
- You didn't.
Children!
What?
Smell some Indians in Montana?
No. Now be quiet.
What is it?
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.
I thought I'd nap before sundown.
Sneak up on them in the dark.
What are you laughing at?
Here you go.
There's 6 horses.
It's got to be them.
- You got good eyes.
- We got to tie these up.
Can you teach me to be a better poker player?
- What? Now?
- You might be dead later.
You're all heart.
Poker's about observing.
Observe the U.S. Cavalry brand and the shoes.
They're not Indian.
These are tells.
- You got tells too.
- Do not.
- You play with your hair at cards.
- I never...
Would you two shut up?
Just listen!
Sounds like a music box, doesn't it?
Oh, hey. There they are.
There's the music box she talked about.
And look at that fella in the back.
He's wearing your sweetheart's wedding dress, Mary Margaret.
Margaret Mary. She's not...
You're on a first-name basis.
Would you two be quiet!
Be quiet!
You're crazy.
Did you see any money over there?
No.
Can't see anything.
We could take them easy.
They're half drunk...
That's a strange new word in your vocabulary, "we." This is your show.
You'd just stand there and let me face six guys with six guns?
Yeah.
I have one gun, that's six bullets.
They got six guns, that's 36 bullets.
What if they got 2? That's 72 bullets.
Maybe they got rifles.
Shut up. You're babbling.
You're babbling.
- No, I wasn't.
- You are babbling.
Don't worry, they're probably drunk.
Coop faced nine men dead sober, didn't you?
He's always dead sober.
- She didn't mean that.
- That's what she said.
I said the outlaws were sober!
Shut up!
Here he comes.
What if there's trouble? Seriously.
- I'm right behind you.
- You are?
No "wheels coming off" shit.
That was broken bones.
This is dying.
Other way.
Dying. Right.
- Give it to me.
- What?
It may be my last chance.
Hand it over.
- How dare you?
- I need all I can get.
- No, just take your own.
- Got to be under there.
- All right, 50 percent.
- Fifty percent?
- No!
- Fifty-fifty.
- No.
- Sixty-forty. Sixty-forty.
- Sixty-forty.
- All right, 60-40.
You're the fastest draw.
Why do you need my tiny gun?
Who said that?
It's true. I am fast, but...
I can't hit shit, especially when
I aim at people, so I need bullets.
- You back me up?
- Yeah.
- Bert.
- Bret. My name is Bret.
You're Annabelle, he's Coop.
It's like you're shooting me.
Be careful, okay?
Of course. You too.
Hey, everyone.
Wake up!
No need to get alarmed.
I saw your fire and thought
I'd come visit for a while.
Who are you?
Bert Maverick.
No. I'm Bret Maverick, and I'm here to say each one of you has a gun... pointed at your heads.
Just whistle, so they can hear you.
You're surrounded.
Did another wheel come off?
Clap if you can't whistle!
See? They're out there.
Marshal Zane Cooper will blow your brains out. Probably heard of him.
I know you're thinking he's old, decrepit, gums his food and his women.
But he can still shoot straight.
After you is Ugly Annie Bransford.
When she was born, she came out backwards and no one noticed.
Her parents had to tie a pork chop to her so the dog would play with her.
When making love, she has to pretend she's somebody else.
You're all right, Bart.
Admit it. That was funny.
I didn't think so.
Well, some Indians attacked a wagon train.
They said it might be whites acting like Indians, but I don't believe it.
If you come along with me, we'll settle this matter.
We can all get some more sleep.
So if you just follow me.
Get up.
Get up. Get in a straight line and let's go. Come on.
I'll give you something to remember!
- Aren't you helping him?
- A man could get killed like that.
Did you just help him?
Shot my whiskey bottle!
My hand!
Oh, that's my gun!
Damn you!
Oh, isn't he wonderful?
Oh, yeah.
Look at that!
They're all gone.
Isn't it wonderful?
- It's wonderful. I'll be rich!
- It was nothing, really.
- I'll tell you what you did wrong.
- Now where's the money?
You tell me where it is.
There it is!
I've never seen such beautiful money!
- Take off that dress!
- How dare you!
- Not you. Him.
- Put that cash down!
- I found it!
- I nearly got blown away!
- I'll take the money.
- I'll count it for you.
Don't let her touch it!
Where are you going?
Stay and clean up your mess.
Be mature. Clean up this mess.
Get back!
Put those guns down and line up.
Don't let her get within 10 yards of that cash!
I have found you.
For He said, "Seek and ye shall find."
And I have found you. Oh, rejoice!
Bless you for finding my wedding dress.
Now I can get married.
The Lord says it's good to bear children. The Lord says...
- It's a beautiful dress.
- Thank you.
I'm sure you'll find a husband.
Two thousand five hundred...
Two thousand seven hundred, ma'am.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
She'd know.
Two thousand seven hundred,
Three thousand dollars.
Here you go, the 10 percent we promised.
That leaves us with $27,000, Margaret Mary.
That's not enough to start a mission.
Don't worry. We are honorable women. We promised Mr. Maverick...
$3,000 and we delivered.
The Lord will provide for us.
My pappy used to say:
"Never sneeze when you hide or smile when you lie."
And never, under any circumstances...
"...take money from women who've lost a dog, a wedding dress and a wagon."
Hallelujah!
I lost a wedding dress! Bret!
We have got our money back. Saint Maverick!
You owe me my 30 percent.
I'm a man of my word.
You can have 30 percent of whatever I got.
I hate to interrupt, but I got a problem.
If those renegades weren't real Indians... who was beating those drums?
Maybe it was them.
I'll take care of this.
Anybody get that?
You know about Indians.
Can you speak to him?
I'll do my best.
What's he say?
It seems we've committed a terrible sin.
We're on sacred ground.
We didn't know that.
Can't you tell him?
Yeah.
His gods demand a sacrifice.
There's no other way.
Sacred ground is sacred ground.
Sacrifice?
Human.
We can go if one of us passes a bravery test... but one of us must go with him.
What's the bravery test?
He cuts off your hands.
If you don't make a sound, you pass.
I'll die before I let him touch you.
There's too many of them.
You can't protect me.
You're right. Don't show fear.
It makes them crazy.
One of us must go, or there'll be bloodshed.
- I'll go.
- No, I'll go.
I owe you.
I almost got you killed twice.
I can't do what you can.
You get these people to safety.
I'll go, but it's okay.
Third time lucky.
Oh, Bret.
I liked it just now when you called me Bret.
- One thing.
- What, Bret?
When you bluff, never tap your fingernails on your teeth.
That's your second giveaway.
You gotta work on that.
Even at a time like this, you think of others.
Goodbye, my lady.
You were right, Coop.
I never felt better than I do right now.
Take care of yourself.
Now when they...
Cut my hands off, my lucky shirt'll fit.
- Bye.
- Bye, Bret.
What was that about? My throat's killing me.
- Tell you later.
- Tell me later.
Bye.
I could die happy right now.
I'm just trying to...
Will you slow down?
I can't get my... Where'd you get this useless piece of junk?
I won it off a Russian guy in a card game. Okay, okay. Watch out!
My bicycle. Look at that.
I'll stick with a horse.
What are they laughing at?
Nobody's ever ridden it before.
You sure do pick the spots.
Yeah, I know.
Next time you people drive us off,
I'll find... some swampland so awful you'll leave us alone.
- Is that good?
- Nah.
What's with the drums and war paint and horses?
We had a lousy year.
Not much left to hunt. So when this
Russian archduke, where I got the bike... came and wanted to see the real West, I said, "Okay."
He pays well.
We get dressed up in war paint and whoop around like idiots.
He wants me to speak like they say in books, "How, white man."
You people are such assholes.
And he's got to hear the war drums all the time!
Gets on my nerves.
You'll move on, you'll have the cash. What's eating you?
- Bret.
- What?
I don't have the $1,000 I owe you.
Oh, I knew you'd say that.
I'm sorry. You'll get it as soon as I change my rubles into dollars.
When will that be? I've got a few days to make it to that big game.
Oh, the big game, the big game. You need
$25,000 to get into that. You're crazy.
I know that.
I suppose I have to win the $3,000.
If I get your $1,000 in time,
I'll only have to win $2,000.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- What?
You've got $22,000?
Cash?
It's not frog skins.
I've never seen $22,000.
I've never seen 25.
This is terrible!
Where is it? Can I see it?
Why not?
- Can I touch it?
- You can roll in it.
- Where is it?
- Where else?
What is this stuff?
- Oh, ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
- What?
It's... It's newspaper.
- You all right? Was it the food?
- No, no, no!
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her. Annabelle.
- What?
- Annabelle.
How could she rob me of $22,000 when I was off to face my doom?
You were gonna cut my hands off, she robbed me anyway!
- What are you talking about?
- No decency!
Pull yourself together!
Everyone's looking.
I got your money.
I wanted to see how you'd react.
I was just teasing you.
Teasing? I don't like being teased.
I'll kill you.
You'll be dead, I'll be happy.
- Wait!
- What?
- Did you say dead?
- Yes.
I just got an idea.
Big asshole.
How, white man!
Hello, noble savage.
I've had a terrible day.
I kill every animal in sight and it's boring me.
Boring?
Maybe His Largeness be interested in greatest Western thrill of all.
What is it? What?
Come, come!
What is greatest Western thrill?
Kill Injun.
Kill...?
Is it legal?
White man been doing it for years, but much wampum needed.
How much?
One thousand.
One thousand?
Don't tie him.
That wouldn't be sporting.
No, he'll lose, but easy hit.
Dying anyway.
Smoke too much tobacco.
Very sick. Put out of misery.
Deal?
Deal.
Me go find and give him courage.
Indian law say death private thing.
You wait here.
Psst! Hey!
- Bret?
- Who else? Did you fix his gun?
I couldn't.
He wouldn't let go of it.
Great
What's in it for me if I die?
I got him up to $500.
Five hundred? Worth the risk.
Let's get it over with.
Two-fifty a piece.
I'm the one taking all the risk.
Why do you need $250?
So, Arch!
Look sick.
Tell him to run.
No, no, no. Wrong!
What's wrong?
I don't want to lose the light.
Injun shot by white man's weapon not reach Happy Hunting Ground.
Injun die by Indian way.
- I never used one of those.
- Psst!
Real easy, see?
No wonder you people were so easy to conquer. Give me it!
Two thousand dollars.
Two thousand dollars?
Two thousand. Give me that.
Two thousand.
Come, come!
Oh, shit.
I killed him. I killed him.
I really killed him.
Are you just going to leave him for the vultures?
Never liked him much anyway.
Come, we get the money now.
Partner, we did it!
We did it. Yeah, "we" did it.
You son of a bitch.
He could have killed me.
- Arrows missing, bullets whiz...
- We had to make it look real.
Real? You knew he'd miss me by this much!
- Shoot this.
- You shoot it.
You shoot it. I'll show you something.
You go run.
I'll give you a 5-second start.
- Hey, gratitude! I saved your life!
- What?
Shoot it. I'll show you.
- That's not funny.
- Hurts, doesn't it?
Anybody who uses my bow can't use their hand for half a day.
And fresh from the mint.
All yours. You earned it.
I'd kiss you if there weren't so many people.
Don't do that.
So I guess you'll be going now.
How will I explain I got away... with my hands still attached?
Tell them you got us drunk and escaped in the confusion.
Nobody'll believe that.
It's stupid.
You people believe anything.
Besides, that's not $500.
- I got the big dunce up to $1,000.
- From $500 to $1,000?
- Who's the best?
- He would've gone for $2,000.
No! That's pushing it, really.
All I need now is another $2,000 and I'm in the game.
With your luck, you'll win it soon.
With my luck,
I'll lose this 1,000.
- Hey, what's this?
- What?
You insult me by counting it in front of me? It's all there.
I'm sorry Joseph, but lately, even my close friends... have stiffed me.
Oh, hey, Mav!
What are friends for?
Yeah. It's all there, isn't it?
It was high time I hotfooted it out of there... because I knew it wouldn't be long before Joseph had a scheme... to help me reinvest my newly-acquired thousand.
Goodbye, Bert.
The $2,000 wasn't the only thing
I was short on.
I was really getting short on time.
Hey!
Hey!
Should've paid your cowhands a little more.
Lucky for you,
I don't mind being made a fool of.
I'd never let you make that poker game.
But if you hadn't done what you did, I might've let you live.
But now I won't.
It occurred to me, before I blacked out, he might be teasing.
And then again... maybe not.
All right, Lord.
That's enough. I've... I've found humility.
If you could get me out of this,
I don't mean to be... too presumptuous, but...
Let's go! Go, Ollie, go!
Thank you, Lord.
All right, Ollie.
You can stop now.
Ollie, you can stop.
You can stop, Ollie.
You can stop. Attaboy, attaboy.
All right, Ollie.
Don't go, Ollie. Please don't.
Stay there, pal. Come on!
No! No, no. Don't run!
Ollie!
Bret! Bret!
Bret Maverick. Look at you.
- My hero's alive and well.
- You actually seem glad to see me.
Well, I am.
How ever did you escape from those hostiles?
I'm not exactly a whole man anymore.
Oh, Bret.
My beautiful, beautiful, perfect male.
I don't want to seem forward, but...
I was wondering, could you loan me $4,000?
I've only broken even at the poker tables these last few days.
That means you can't enter.
Mrs. B., if it was within my power,
I'd give you that money in a heartbeat.
The problem is,
I'm $2,000 short myself.
And my poor, pure heart was just set on it.
This wine is for peasants!
Set on this, Mrs. Bransford.
Just stay as pure as you are right now and I'll be back soon.
Hunting savages, wasn't that dangerous?
It's primitive, but I like killing.
Excuse me, sir, could I have a word with you?
Do you know who I am?
No, but I know who I am.
Maverick, Indian Affairs.
It's over for you, Dukey.
Joseph talked.
I know no one with that name.
Funny. That's exactly what he said of you when I started investigating the murder.
But once in jail, he told the truth, and so will you.
But I no American.
Murder's murder, Dukey.
You're looking at... a minimum of 10 years in jail and a $6,000 fine.
Six? Wait, wait! I have... six... Six... Six thousand.
I have 6,000. Please help me.
Do you know the penalty involved in bribing someone from Indian Affairs?
No, please, I'm going home.
Please. Take the 6. Fix it. Please.
- Take, take!
- All right.
The courts are overworked.
I'll give you a break.
Don't shoot any more Indians.
- All right?
- No, no.
Excuse me, has there been an accident?
Miss Annabelle, can I speak with you?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Good luck, Miss Annabelle.
- Gentlemen.
I got something to show you.
Close your eyes, Annabelle.
You're in the game!
I'm in the game!
- Best be quiet.
- Is there no end to your goodness?
Apparently not.
Heaven will kiss you for this one,
Mr. Maverick.
I just realized something.
What?
You can't help it, can you?
You are irresistible.
If by some small chance you happen to win, I'll expect my 50 percent.
Then I'll be expecting
50 percent of your winnings.
Perhaps we should consider that a loan.
Let him go!
How'd you get here? Tell me!
No, you tell me... what did you mean when you said you'd never let me make it to this game?
Who's trying to stop me?
It's gonna be a pleasure playing you again.
The pleasure's all yours.
Come on.
All right, all right!
All right, come on.
Hey!
My, my, my.
Hit it!
Welcome to my ship, the Lauren Belle.
And welcome to the first annual...
All River's
Draw Poker Championship.
Rules are simple.
We play till we drop.
Winner takes all.
The dealer can call one break of one hour.
As soon as you're busted, you're gone.
Twenty of us playing, which means there's going to be 19 broken hearts.
Let's make it a great contest.
An honest, great contest.
For that reason...
I've imported one of the West's most remarkable lawmen.
Marshal Zane Cooper.
He'll show us how to run things.
Come on up here, Coop.
Tell us how you're gonna do it.
Thank you, Commodore Duvall.
Now players, anyone caught cheating... will forfeit his entry fee and be banned.
See these?
They're the only two allowed here.
Anyone breaking rules... better be a faster draw than me.
And better learn how to swim.
Thank you, sir.
- Commodore.
- All right, gamblers... step right up and bring your money.
After you.
Twenty-five thousand dollars.
That's correct. Here.
Make your mark right here.
Thank you, sir.
Put in the money and make your mark, gentlemen.
Good luck to you.
There it is.
I'll take good care of it.
Count that, would you?
- It's all there.
- I'm sure it is.
The games will begin in 10 minutes.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we had
$25,000 more, we'd have a half-million.
- We're minus one entry fee.
- What?
I believe it's yours.
Do I need to count it?
I don't think so.
Even half-million.
This safe was brought in specially for this contest.
I selected the combination.
I'm the only one that knows it.
Commodore, the money's as protected as I can make it.
There it is. Gamblers... find your designated table and let's play some poker!
Four aces.
Five thousand.
Mr. Maverick wins the pot.
Dumb ass.
I'll call you.
Gentlemen... four kings.
All right, young man. Let's go.
Hey! A cheater!
You cheating son of a bitch!
Sit down! I'll handle this.
I knew it was him!
Don't touch my chips!
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second!
Where are you taking me?
I can't swim!
Gentlemen, my pleasure.
Kings over tens, gentlemen.
Ripped my shirt!
Time to go for a swim.
Divide the chips among the players.
You son of a bitch!
Sorry, old-timer, that's it.
- Sir.
- If you don't mind.
- At your pleasure.
- Thank you, Mr. Coop.
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Good game, Hightower.
- Hightower retires.
Oh.
Four queens.
Congratulations.
Chips'll be waiting at the main table.
Good luck in the final game.
Full house, kings over ace.
That's a good hand.
That beats one... two... three sevens.
But not four.
What?
I didn't...
Sir, why don't we go get a drink?
Get some fresh air.
You'll feel better if you get fresh air.
There we go. Watch your step.
- I hate those sad losers.
- Don't play if you can't afford it.
How's it look?
It looks like you,
Mrs. Bransford, the Spaniard... and, unless a miracle happens,
Maverick.
Maverick?
When it's decided, call a break for an hour... and let's set it up at that table.
I was going to leave you something, but I'm cleaned out.
You're a hell of a player.
Ma'am, that's the most I ever enjoyed losing.
- A thousand for you.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Congratulations. I'll see that your chips are set up for the next game.
Good luck to you, son.
Leave your chips here, I'll make sure they're transferred for the final game.
Congratulations.
The players can take a one-hour break.
Anyone not back in their seat at the stroke of 5 forfeits their winnings.
- Annabelle.
- Bret.
Annabelle
I thought you were...
Good morning.
Sorry.
Thirty minutes, everybody.
Thirty minutes to the final game.
He's a good four minutes fast.
30 minutes...
Positions, sir?
Dealer over there.
Give me the cards.
Fifteen minutes, everybody.
- Fifteen minutes.
- Maybe we better get serious.
Here.
I got it, if you don't mind.
Madam, we have rules about that on board ship.
That's my gun.
- It's your gun?
- Yeah, it's mine.
Do you swim?
Swim? No.
But she does and it's her gun.
And this one?
- Is this hers too?
- I'm carrying it for her.
- What?
- Madam, is this your husband?
- How about a little boat?
- A little boat?
Well, you look particularly ravishing for 5 in the morning.
Nice glow about you.
Five minutes, Mr. Maverick!
Four minutes!
Four minutes to game time, folks!
Dealer... start dividing up Maverick's chips.
- Looks like he's a no-show.
- Yes, sir.
Wait!
Excuse me.
Dealer, you can start the game.
Ante up, everyone, 50 dollars.
A thousand and two more.
I'll see your 2,000 and...
Can I bid everything I have left?
Yes, ma'am.
That'll be $12,000.
- Too rich for my blood.
- I'm out.
What the hell.
I feel like being silly. I'll call.
It's just a pair of sixes.
If you can beat that, you got me licked.
That's not a totally unpleasant prospect.
I'm out of the game.
You put me out of the game.
Yes, I did.
I didn't do any of my tells.
I didn't twirl my hair or flick my teeth.
You held your breath.
No, I wasn't.
- Did I hold my breath?
- Yes.
Did I hold my breath?
Did I?
See?
Sorry. See, usually... when you get excited, you breathe heavily.
How do you? Oh.
I'll just pretend I was playing with somebody else's money.
- Shouldn't be hard.
- Gentlemen.
You did hold your breath.
Ante up.
It's up to you, commodore, to open.
I'll open for 5,000.
Five thousand?
I'll see your 5... and raise you 5.
Ten thousand to you, Mr. Maverick.
Call.
And 5 more to me.
Cards, gentlemen.
Two cards, please.
- Sir?
- Two.
Mr. Maverick.
One card, but not from you.
Put the deck down.
What?
I'd like a new deck, new cut and a new shuffle.
I'm sorry, that isn't permitted.
You can have a new dealer if you'd like, but that's it.
In that case,
I'd like you to deal.
- Me?
- Just one from the top would be sufficient.
I like that.
Shows trust.
The commodore has four of a kind,
Angel has a small straight flush... and I don't have the least idea what Maverick has.
It's up to you, commodore.
Since it looks like I'm sucking hind tit,
I think I'll just bet my whole tray.
The Commodore wagers $25,000.
I'll see your 25.
I guess we're even.
I'll raise you everything I've got.
That's half a million dollars to the winner.
That should cover the commodore.
Aren't you gonna look at your card?
No need.
What are you playing at?
Look at it.
I'd look at my card if I were you.
This is your portion of the pot.
What kind of poker you playing?
Look at that card!
Cards have been called, commodore.
Show your cards.
I have two small pair.
Eights... and eights.
Thank you.
You're not gonna look at your card?
Well... how you gonna know if you can beat my straight flush?
Unbeatable!
Ten of spades.
Jack of spades.
Queen of spades and king of spades.
A possible royal flush.
Quiet! Quiet!
You beat him.
You miserable, cheating son of a bitch!
You all right?
I can't believe
I pulled that card. I...
Did I ever tell you how I was in the desert?
The snakes...
You're babbling.
You're babbling.
Your security isn't worth a damn!
Everybody's got a gun!
Ladies and gents... for our presentation of one-half million dollars to our winner...
Mr. Maverick!
I want to congratulate you on a game well played.
I wish your moment could last longer... but I see all this money.
Hell, I just... got to take it.
What?
I'll have regrets, I'm sure, but I'm going to take it nevertheless.
Move down the steps.
- Cut it out.
- This is no time to be brave, Bertie boy.
Down the stairs, now.
You too, commodore. Move it!
- I'll take your bag.
- Get your hands off.
Get away from here!
Down the stairs. Move!
You sidewinding son of a bitch!
I worked my ass off for that.
I'll be coming for it.
I'll look for you.
Look real hard! That's my money.
Was your money.
Do as he said!
I don't want to see any faces looking this way.
- Captain!
- Yes, sir?
- Get my gun.
- Yes, sir.
He's headed for the lifeboat.
- Try and stop him!
- Yes, sir.
Out of my way!
I'll kill that son of a bitch.
Go, go, go!
There he is.
Let him go!
- Let him go?
- The man saved my life!
I can always win more money.
Anyway, I found out what I came here for.
Do I have to remind you that's $500,000 that bastard's taking?
And it grieves me, but it's my half million.
It's only money, right?
Right!
- Only money?
- It's not worth killing a man.
No!
I won't swear out a warrant against him.
Well, I'll be damned!
I will be damned.
Let's toast our champion.
Our champion!
Fiddle that Coop!
Goodbye!
Well...
Oh, here.
I meant to give you this.
I took it from you on the stage.
You should have it.
I meant to give you this cufflink...
I took before you left with the Indians.
I been looking for it.
Yeah, I have. It's all right.
Well... bye.
You gonna miss me?
You are gonna miss me.
- How do you know?
- You were holding your breath.
I was not.
Maybe I was.
Well, I...
I guess I better go make my stage.
See you in Abilene.
New Orleans, wasn't it?
Either.
Where have you been?
I had to say goodbye to a lot of people.
I didn't want them thinking
I was off to meet someone.
And I did a lot of twists and turns and backtracked a lot... to keep anyone from following me.
I thought we were in this together.
You win, I do nothing.
Someone else wins, I do what I did.
You didn't tell me
Angel was in it too.
Oh.
If Angel had won, we'd split it the same way.
The reason I brought him in...
I telegraphed him to keep Maverick out of the game.
He messed up on that.
Poor, dead bastard.
I don't like secrets.
Yes, well, you're probably not gonna like this one either.
I don't know what it is,
I guess it's my greedy nature.
But I've decided... not to share it with you.
Uncock it.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Let's get real cozy.
Parlay some.
Put your hands down.
You look ridiculous.
I admit, you had me fooled.
Not many can.
But you did save my life.
It wouldn't be neighborly to kill you.
Besides... everybody knows what you are now, anyway.
All your life's work, all the good you did... it's all been wiped away.
Was it worth it?
You got nothing to show for it.
What you said is all true.
I traded every decent thing I know for that money.
You can't leave me alive.
I don't care where you go... one night you'll relax.
Guess who'll be waiting.
You couldn't sneak up on a corpse, Coop.
Not anymore.
You're a decrepit old has-been.
Well, what're you going to do?
Maybe the fairest thing would be... let one of you kill the other.
I'll let you decide which.
Give me that!
That, as they say, is that!
Oh, shit!
You dirty, rotten, double-crossed...
I've never committed a cold-blooded murder in my life.
And I won't.
Not till I find Maverick.
Decrepit old has-been?
Couldn't sneak up on a corpse?
You got $500,000 in that satchel and your gun is 8 feet away.
Not smart. Not smart at all.
Guess not.
It's plain to see who won the toss-up.
You shoot the commodore in the back?
No.
Good idea, but no.
I really enjoyed nailing that bastard.
No room in poker for cheats.
He won't be able to touch a deck of cards this side of the Mississippi.
My old pappy used to say:
"There is no more deeply moving religious experience... than cheating a cheater."
I never said that once.
You've misquoted me all your life.
- Are we quibbling fine points?
- I'm sick of it!
The things you said were so dumb
I had to improve on them.
Dumb?
Will you cut that out, Pappy!
These are a buck apiece.
You taught me to save money.
Really? Let me have one.
- Yeah, those are the good ones.
- They are?
You got a match?
Bret, Coop, everything good?
Enough cigars, brandy, hot water?
- Yell if you need anything.
- Yes, Mrs. D.
I certainly hope this shirt fits you.
It's from the best shirtmaker in San Francisco.
Isn't she sweet?
Hell of a shirt, but she's robbing us.
Look! Here's a lot of money and your gun is 6 feet away.
Eight.
What a remarkable family.
How'd she...?
How'd you figure that?
You don't have the exclusive on tells.
You both have the same height and build. You both... kiss the same way, you both... draw your guns alike and sing the wrong words to "Amazing Grace."
We do not.
My! Such... splendid similarities.
From the looks of things, the lady better bring more hot water.
Bye.
Bret, son, you know what we ended up with?
What?
A half-a-million-dollar silk shirt.
Nope. We ended up with a quarter-of-a-million-dollar silk shirt... because my old pappy used to say,
"Never put the cart..."
No. "Don't count..." No.
"Don't put your eggs in one basket."
Now that, I said.
- So I have a boot for you.
- A boot?
And the other one's twice as heavy.
Bret, that's my boy.
What are kids for?
I'd like the boot back, though.
Be my guest.
Thank you.
I don't know why I left the other half in the satchel.
- I do.
- So do I.
It'll be lots of fun getting it back.
- Bret.
- Yes, sir?
Something I got to know, son.
How did you come up with that ace of spades?
You won't believe me.
I'm your father, I'll believe you.
Magic.
Magic?
Magic.
I believe you.
Thanks.
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.
There's no ether, either.
Jesus Christ.
You there!
Is this the last one?
Oh God, what a mess.
At least there's no gangrene.
There will be if it doesn't come off soon.
Well I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.
I'm sorry.
Let's coffee up.
He can wait a few more minutes.
Oh God!
Glass.
- Is that Tucker's men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.
How long has it been like this?
We found 'em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.
Is that you, Lieutenant?
Sons of bitches.
Come on. You better take cover
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover
There you go.
You went to the hospital?
It was no good
What's going on here?
What's going on here?
That seems to be the question, all right.
See, you could ask the major... but he don't know
He's busy.
He's busy trying to figure out how come the officers' mess... run out of peach ice cream.
Then, of course, you got the general.
He comes up to see the show.
All he knows is there ain't no show... which ain't entirely correct
'cause we started a balloon up... but they shot her down before we got off the ground.
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.
Now, the major, he's looking at the general.
He's thinking to himself,
I better do something.
You know what that means.
I sure as hell don't want to be the first one across this field.
They're supposed to be beat up just like us
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.
So far, the only thing been killed out here is three milking cows.
Course, that's about to change
You son of a bitch.
You know, some of the boys are saying if we ain't gonna fight... we could just settle this whole business with a little... high-stakes poker.
Wouldn't that be a sight?
A bunch of fellas sitting in the middle of this field... drawing cards.
What is it, sir?
Looks like a suicide
Tucker!
What's he doing?
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say nothing.
Come on back, you son of a bitch!
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.
Forgive me, Father.
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!
- Ready!
- I got him
Don't...
Don't take off my foot.
You rest easy, son.
You'll keep your foot.
With God as my judge, you'll keep it.
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?
Bring up my ambulance, and bring my surgeon with it!
We got an officer who's worth something lying here.
The strangeness of this life cannot be measured.
In trying to produce my own death...
I was elevated to the status of a living hero.
I was also awarded Cisco...
the trusty mount that carried me across the field that day.
And on full recovery, was given transfer to any station I desired.
The bloody slaughter continues in the east as I arrive at Fort Hayes.
A tiny island of men and material surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie.
Lieutenant.
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?
Down at the end of the hall.
Thank you.
Lt. John J. Dunbar.
Lt. John J. Dunbar?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Indian fighter
Excuse me?
It says here that you're to be posted on the frontier.
The frontier is Indian country.
I quickly deduced that you're an Indian fighter.
I did not ascend to this position by being stupid.
- No, sir.
- No, sir
It says here that you've been decorated.
Yes, sir.
And they sent you here to be posted?
Actually, sir,
I'm here at my own request.
Really? Why?
I've always wanted to see the frontier.
You want to see the frontier?
Yes, sir.
Before it's gone.
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.
Sir...
Knight.
I am sending you on a knight's errand.
You will report to Captain Cargill... at the furthermost outpost of the realm...
Fort Sedgewick.
My personal seal will assure your safety... through many miles of wild and hostile country.
- I was wondering...
- Yes?
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?
You think I don't know?
- No, sir.
- You think that.
- It's just that I don't know...
- Hold your tongue.
I am in a generous mood and I will grant your boon.
See that peasant out there?
He calls himself Timmons.
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.
He knows the way.
Thank you. That is all.
Sir Knight?
I've just pissed in my pants... and nobody can do anything about it.
To your journey!
To my journey!
Haw!
Over a little bit, Jim!
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
I'll have my crown now.
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?
I said I'll have my crown right now!
Now!
No.
- I'll get your crown.
- No.
Sir?
Major?
The king is dead.
Long live the king.
Get these kids out of here, come on!
Haw, Jim and Jake!
Gee a little bit, Jim!
The hell was that?
What is that?
What the hell is that?
Why don't you put that in your book?
Were it not for my companion...
I believe I would be having the time of my life.
I know he means well...
but he is quite possibly the foulest man I have ever met.
How far you make the Fort?
Far.
How far?
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?
It's to be my post.
My home.
You ain't hard to please,
I'll give you that much.
Look yonder
What you got there?
Somebody back east is saying,
Why don't she write?
You stupid bastard.
Get up, Timmons.
Get up!
Get up!
Come on. Get up.
Get up!
Someone poked me in my butt.
Was that you?
Goddamn it!
I'm gonna have a welt.
Cpl. Guest?
You don't have to talk to me, just please come out.
It's the end.
Assemble the men in front of my quarters.
You hate me
But I feel none of the same for you.
You men stayed.
You stayed after they took all our horses.
You stayed after all the others deserted.
You stayed after the army failed to resupply us.
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes... just as you have... day after miserable day.
And all I can say is that I'm proud of you.
Now get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.
The army can go to hell.
Go.
Get your things.
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.
Other times, they'll be thick, like curls on a whore
What about Indians?
Indians? Goddamn Indians!
You just as soon not see 'em unless the bastards are dead.
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.
Ho, up there!
Not what you would call much of a going concern now, is it?
Go down there
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.
Go down there.
There, son of a bitch!
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant!
Everybody's run off or got killed.
All right. Let's unload the wagon.
What? What, and leave it all here?
I'm staying, too.
There ain't nothing here.
No, not at the moment.
We don't know what's happened.
Things being as they are... we might as well just turn around and get headed back.
This is my post.
This is my post?
This is my post.
This is my post?
Jesus H. Christ.
What, are you crazy, boy?
Fast son of a bitch.
- Jesus H. Christ.
- This is my post.
All right, put it down.
And these are the post provisions, all right? Now get your ass off the wagon.
- Put it down!
- And help me unload.
We're just havin' a conversation, now put it down.
I'll let them know where you are.
Good.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Jake and Jim!
Good mule!
Haw up there now!
Good mules!
Have arrived to find
Fort Sedgewick deserted.
Am now waiting for garrison's return or word from headquarters.
The posits in exceedingly poor condition...
and I have decided to assign myself clean-up duty beginning tomorrow.
Supplies are abundant...
and the country is everything I dreamed it would be.
There can be no place like this on Earth.
Bad horse.
Bad horse.
The animals in the pond had not been poisoned.
They had all been shot.
But why? Was it for sport?
Could it have been out of spite?
My first guess would have been that the men here were starving.
But this rotting waste speaks to the contrary.
The caves are an even bigger mystery.
What could have driven men to live in caves?
Perhaps they were frightened.
Maybe there had been some sort of revolt.
I can make no sense of the clues left me here.
Perhaps my relief will provide the answers.
Come on, Cisco. One more time.
Git up!
Come on! Git up, Cisco.
Git up!
Git up! There you go!
Easy.
And if I...
Look at me.
Don't hurt my mules.
Stop.
Stop it.
Please don't hurt my mules.
I am pleased with my efforts thus far.
For all my improvements, though, there remains an ugliness here I cannot dispel.
An injury that goes beyond neglect and like a bruise, it will be slow to heal.
It's been almost 30 days.
I have come to enjoy the patterns of my life at Fort Sedgewick.
Especially my daily reconnaissance rides with Cisco.
Each day, we go further into the prairie and every discovery...
big or small, becomes etched in my mind forever.
It would seem I've been marooned, as no one has yet come for me.
I can only assume that there is a problem, which the army will solve shortly.
Maybe I am being foolish in my optimism...
but when I look to the eastern horizon...
I never fail to hope that a column might be out there.
Still no sign of Capt. Cargill's command.
Though well-supplied,
I've decided to ration my goods...
as if I were part of a post instead of the whole affair.
There's a wolf who seems intent on the goings-on here.
He does not seem inclined to be a nuisance, however.
And aside from Cisco, has been my only company.
He's appeared each afternoon for the past two days.
He has two milky white paws.
If he comes calling tomorrow...
I will name him Two-Socks.
Almost a month and no one has come.
The longer this condition persists...
the less inclined I am to believe that anyone will.
Rain has forced me indoors for most of two days now...
and I have begun work on an awning.
It is the loneliest of times for me now...
but I can say honestly that I am not unhappy.
How can I marry a pretty little girl
When I got no coat to put on?
Soldier, soldier
Won't you marry me
Before the fight comes home?
How can I marry a pretty little girl
When I got no shoes to put on?
How can I marry a pretty little girl
When I got no hat to put on?
Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me
Before the fight comes home?
How can I marry an ugly little girl
When I got a pretty wife back home?
You there!
Have made first contact with a wild Indian.
One came to the fort and tried to steal my horse.
When I appeared, he became frightened and ran off.
Have decided to bury excess ordnance lets it fall into enemy hands.
Keeping only the barest necessities for myself.
My afternoon rides have been pared down to short circular patrols...
always keeping the post in sight.
Am taking steps to prepare for another visitation.
Do not know how many more might be in the vicinity...
but am assuming that where there is one there's sure to be another.
Most of my work has been geared toward creating the illusion...
of strength and stability.
I'm still alone, however, and unless troops arrive soon...
all may be lost.
It's been two days now, and nothing.
My presence here must have been reported by now.
Have made all the preparations I can think of.
Cannot mount an adequate defense as I am still alone.
But will try to make a big impression when they come.
Waiting.
Post-script...
The man I encountered was a magnificent-looking fellow.
I realize now that I have been wrong.
All this time, I've been waiting.
Waiting for what?
For someone to find me?
For Indians to take my horse?
To see a buffalo?
Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.
It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it.
Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.
I do not know the outcome or wisdom of this thinking...
but I've become a target and a target makes a poor impression.
I am through waiting.
What are you looking at?
Son of a bitch!
No. Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
You need help. You're hurt.
- You need...
- No!
Let me... You need help.
You need help. You're hurt.
Let me help you.
You're hurt.
Don't.
She's hurt.
She's hurt.
No. She's hurt.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Hi!
Come.
Please, sit down.
Sit down.
Wait just a... Just a minute.
Tatanka. Buffalo.
- Buffalo.
- Tatanka.
Buffalo. Tatanka.
The fierce one, as I call him, seems a very tough fellow.
I hope I never have to fight him.
From the little I know, he seems to be honest and very direct.
I like the quiet one immensely.
He's been patient and inquisitive.
He seems eager to communicate.
I would conclude that he is a man of some weight among his people.
Buffalo.
I believe I made an even greater impression on their next visit.
I produced a coffee grinder, something none of them had seen before.
Is the coffee not good?
It's too strong, maybe.
Sugar.
Put in.
Taste it.
Sugar.
You want some?
You want some?
That's a lot.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's good to finally have some company.
So much goes unsaid and I have the feeling that these people...
the quiet one in particular, want something from me.
Made presents of coffee and most of the sugar.
It didn't figure to last anyway.
Don't believe I go too far in saying...
that a foundation for good relations is being laid.
Christinel
Get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!
Billy, you get away from those puppies!
Damn!
Get the kids, and get them in the house.
Go on!
Christine!
Christine! Where are you?
I'm up here, mother.
- Get down now.
- Why?
Just do it.
Stay right where you are. Get back.
Do you hear me?
Joe, get in the house right now!
Willie!
- Who is it, Willie?
- They look like Pawnee.
My father and your father are talking to them.
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
Go on. You heard him. Get out of here.
Run, Christine!
I said run!
Joe!
Christine!
Mommyl
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.
Two Socks, like Cisco, has become a trusted friend.
He still won't eat from my hand...
but his keen eyes and ears never fail to alert me when something is wrong.
Tatanka.
No.
No, I haven't seen any buffalo.
Sorry.
Are you hungry?
Are you hungry?
I have food. I have a lot of food.
Nothing I've been told about these people is correct.
They are not beggars and thieves.
They are not the bogeymen they've been made out to be.
On the contrary, they are polite guests and have a familiar humor I enjoy.
Real communication is slow, however...
and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.
Most of our progress has been built on the basis of failure...
rather than success.
I've thought to inquire if the woman I found lived or not...
but it seems far too complicated a subject, given our limitations.
One thing is clear, however.
There are no buffalo.
And it weighs heavy on their minds.
Yesterday's meeting was the best yet.
It seems I've been invited to the village and I'm looking forward to going.
Hello.
You...
Here...
Good.
Thank you. I feel good.
I feel good.
The soldier fort.
Wait.
What is your names?
- Our names?
- What is his name?
He...
He...
Kick.
Kick?
More.
More kick?
More kicking?
Kicking.
Bird? Bird, kicking bird.
Kicking Bird.
What is he...
Is he chief?
No.
A holy man.
Holy man.
Your name?
- I don't...
- How are you called?
Get up?
Stand up?
Stands?
Stands. Your name's 'Stands'?
Stands.
- With.
- With?
- With.
- Stands with?
Fist?
Yes.
Stands With A Fist?
Stands With A Fist.
I'm John Dunbar.
John Dunbar.
Dumb Bear.
No, not Dumb Bear.
Dunbar.
Dun...
Bar.
Not Dumb Bear.
Dunbar.
There's been an exciting breakthrough with the Indians.
The woman I found on the prairie speaks English...
and today, clear progress was made.
She is white, and though I cannot be sure how she came to be with these people...
I can tell she is not a captive.
While I'm not afraid...
I don't feel completely welcome by everyone in the village.
My being here must be Kicking Bird's idea.
He is very enthusiastic and like two children...
we are both anxious to know more about each other.
But I find myself holding back.
For some reason, I am reluctant to answer all his questions.
Maybe it's my sense of duty...
but something tells me not to say too much.
It was good to see Fort Sedgewick again...
and yet I look forward to another visit with my new neighbors.
This is still my home, however...
and I remain watchful for my relief and can only hope...
that my negotiations with the wild people of the plains will bear fruit.
Buffalo!
Buffalo! I've seen buffalo!
Buffaloes!
Tatanka.
Tatanka?
Yeah.
Riders were sent out to pick up the trail.
In the time it took to gather my things at Sedgewick...
the entire tribe was well on its way.
The efficiency of the people and the speed of which they moved...
was enough to impress any military commander.
Spirits are high, and overnight
I've gone from a person of suspicion...
to one of genuine standing.
I am greeted with open smiles and looks of appreciation.
In short, I have become a celebrity.
Loo ten tant!
- Loo ten tant!
- Loo ten tant!
Scouts picked up the trail exactly where I said it would be.
It was not hard to find...
a gigantic swath of torn-up ground extending to the horizon.
The sheer numbers it took to create this impossible image...
was hard to imagine.
Loo ten tant!
Loo ten tant!
Who would do such a thing?
The field was proof enough...
that it was a people without value and without soul.
With no regard for Sioux rights.
The wagon tracks leading away left little doubt...
and my heart sank, as I knew it could only be white hunters.
Voices that had been joyous all morning...
were now as silent as the dead buffalo left to rot in this valley...
killed only for their tongues and the price of their hides.
Loo ten tant.
It was suddenly clear now what had happened...
and my heart sank as I tried to convince myself...
that the white men who'd been killed were bad people and deserved to die.
But it was no use.
I tried to believe that Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird...
and the others who shared in the killing were not so happy for having done it.
But they were.
As I looked at familiar faces,
I realized that the gap between us...
was greater than I could ever have imagined.
As they celebrated into the night the coming hunt...
it was hard to know where to be.
I don't know if they understood, but I could not sleep among them.
There had been no looks, and there was no blame.
There was only the confusion of a people not able to predict a future.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
I can't.
No, I'm full.
I'm full, and I can't tell the story anymore.
No.
Do you want to try it?
Do you want to try it?
Here.
I can't. This is too much.
Good trade.
This is a good trade.
No, no, I can't.
I'm full, I'm tired.
No!
Loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!
Tatanka. Big tatanka.
Big tatanka.
That's my hat!
You're wearing my hat.
It's my hat.
No, you...
My hat.
Good trade.
There you are.
Come here, Cisco.
It seems every day ends with a miracle here.
And whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day.
To stay any longer would have been useless.
We had all the meat we could possibly carry.
We had hunted for three days, losing a half a dozen ponies...
and only three men injured.
I'd never known a people so eager to laugh...
so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other.
And the only word that came to mind was 'harmony.
Many times I've felt alone...
but until this afternoon...
I'd never felt completely lonely.
Made a long patrol today.
There's nothing to report.
Time seems irrelevant except for the fact that I am bored...
and these hours alone are endless.
It is difficult for me to muster any enthusiasm...
for my regular duties here.
And the fort is showing serious signs of neglect.
The truth is,
I am missing the company of my friends.
I can see all of their faces, but somehow it is not enough.
Tomorrow I will pay them a visit.
It may be forward of me, but what can it hurt?
After all, they are my neighbors.
The night sounds have become so familiar as to be comforting.
My life on the prairie's a good one and for the most part, I am content.
The Indians have a great pull for me that goes beyond curiosity.
There's something wise about them and I'm drawn to them...
in ways much stronger than my obligations to the military.
Go home!
Go home!
Damn him.
God! Go home!
Go!
Go home, Two Socks!
Bad wolf!
It is autumn now and I am spending more time than ever with my friends.
They have given me my own lodge and I feel comfortable there.
We talk every day, but I know
Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.
He always wants to know how many more white people are coming.
I tell him they will most likely pass through this country and nothing more.
But I am speaking in half-truths.
One day there will be too many, but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.
I am sure that Stands With A Fist knows that I am holding back... but to her credit, she says nothing.
A war party is going against the
Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.
I sense I made a mistake in doing so...
but I could not bring myself to take it back.
They are my friends, and from what little I gather...
the Pawnee have been very hard on these people.
I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.
Come in, please.
Sit down?
Kicking Bird want to know... why you want to make war on the Pawnee.
They have done nothing to you.
They are Sioux enemies.
Only Sioux warriors to go.
Well then tell him that I have been a warrior... longer than many of the young men who will go on this war party.
Tell him.
He said that the Sioux way of being a warrior... is not the white way.
- You are not ready.
- I know, I understand. But thell him...
Tell him that
I cannot learn these ways in camp.
He also asks that you... watch over his family while he is gone.
This thing he asks is a great honor for you.
Tell him that I would be happy to watch over his family.
He thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.
Who is Dances With Wolves?
It is the name which all the people... are calling you now.
Dances With...
That's right.
That day.
Dances With Wolves.
How do you say it?
I'm here.
We walk.
I cut this off.
I shaved it off. More.
Grass grows on the prairie.
Grass grows on the prairie'?
- Wrong.
- Wrong?
You said, "Fire lives on the prairie"
I did?
No laughing, though.
That man is a fighter.
Again.
- That man is a fighter.
- Okay, I have it.
Yes.
Hoo hoo, right?
No?
Try this.
What's the word... for beautiful?
How did you get your name?
I was not very old... when I came to be with the people.
And I was made to work.
I worked every day, very hard.
There was a woman... who didn't like me much.
She used to call me bad names, and sometimes she...
Beat me?
And one day, she was... calling me these bad names... with her face in my face... and I hit her.
I was not very big, but she fell down.
She fell hard and didn't move.
And then I stood over her with my fist... and I asked if... there was any other woman... who wanted to call me bad names.
No one bothered me after that day.
No, I wouldn't think so.
Show me.
Show me where you hit her.
Why are you not married?
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
I don't...
Bet you were thinking:
Now, why don't he write?
Hello, Two Socks.
Come on.
I won't hurt you.
Come on. You can do this.
You can do this.
Come on.
This is easy.
This is easy, Two Socks.
I am in mourning.
No, we cannot.
- Yes.
- We must be careful.
We must be careful.
Okay.
Wait!
What?
Trouble.
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.
Hunters found them not far to the north.
Soon be here.
Okay!
Shoot the gun!
It was hard to know how to feel.
I'd never been in a battle like this one.
There was no dark political objective.
This was not a fight for territory or riches or to make men free.
It was fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through the winter.
To protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet away.
Stone Calf was a great loss, but even the old men could not remember...
such a one-sided victory.
And I gradually began to look at it in a new way.
I felt a pride I'd never felt before.
I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.
Perhaps the name itself had no meaning.
But as I heard my Sioux name being called over and over...
I knew for the first time who I really was.
The whole village was eager to take up a collection on my behalf.
The generosity of the people was astonishing.
The more valued the gift, the more easily it was given.
Even the poorer families wanted to give up animals they could not afford.
It was hard to turn them away.
Black Shawl was a mystery.
I couldn't guess what she was thinking and she offered no advice...
no words of encouragement.
I may have been the brunt of an inside joke...
that included the entire village...
but I was determined.
Wind In His Hair told me if all the gifts were gone in the morning...
my offer had been accepted.
I spent a sleepless night wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.
I had no idea what Kicking Bird's decision would be.
And for me.
I had never been married before.
I don't know if all grooms have the same experience...
but as Kicking Bird began to speak about what was expected of a Sioux husband...
my mind began to swim in a way that shut out everything but her...
the tiny details of her costume...
the contours of her shape...
the light in her eyes...
the smallness of her feet.
I knew that the love between us would be served.
Yes.
Good.
Bye.
Bye.
You have everything from the soldier fort?
Yes.
There's nothing for me there.
The journal.
Stands With... Wait!
Words are important!
The words in the book are like a trail for people to follow.
Now, it tells everything about my life here. I must get it.
Enough.
I'll catch up.
Injun!
Get him! Injun!
No!
Stay down. Stay.
My God.
God.
It's okay.
Spivey.
- Spivey!
- Yeah, Sergeant.
Tell the major he's waking up.
Move your worthless ass.
You got yourself a hell of a shiner... didn't you?
Major's coming through.
Does he speak English?
I don't know, sir.
Speak English?
Talk English? Talk!
I speak English.
Who are you?
Lt. John J. Dunbar.
This is my post.
Why are you dressed like this?
I came out from Fort Hayes last April, but there was nobody here.
Do you have proof of that?
My journal's on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.
It will tell you everything.
Spivey, you and Edwards were the first ones here.
Did you find anything?
A journal?
No, we didn't find nothing, sir.
Where's Edwards?
He's outside.
He didn't find nothing either.
Somebody find me Edwards.
You turned Injun, didn't you?
Didn't you?
What did you say your name was?
Dunbar.
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.
You say you're an officer?
- God. Did you read my orders?
- No.
Well they're in my journal.
There are no orders.
There's no journal.
Why are you out of uniform?
I have to relieve myself.
- Sergeant, take care of him.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go.
- He's a white man.
- Doesn't look white to me.
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer.
Do you salute him or shoot him?
Here, you. Eyes front.
I said eyes front!
Don't shoot him!
Hit him! Get him!
Get him!
Why are you out of uniform?
What's the army doing out here?
- Lieutenant's asking the questions.
- Bauer.
We're charged with apprehending...
We're charged with apprehending hostiles and recovering stolen property... retrieving white captives taken in hostile raidings.
- There are no hostiles.
- We will ascertain that for ourselves.
If you'll guide us to these camps and serve as an interpreter... your conduct will be re-evaluated.
- What conduct?
- With all due respect...
Your status as a traitor might improve should you choose... to cooperate with the United States Army.
There's nothing for you to do out here.
Are you willing to cooperate or not?
Speak up!
What's that?
Sergeant, form a detail and take this man down to the river.
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.
Not you, Spivey.
Lieutenant.
Major wants to see you.
Spivey.
Spivey. You got paper?
- What's it to you?
- Give me some, shit-bird.
Can you read?
No, I can't read.
What the hell's the difference?
You can't read either.
Now just give me some.
- Quick, give me some!
- All right. Hold your horses.
Bauer!
Let go of me!
Lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.
You son of a bitch!
It's all right.
It's all right.
He's going to get hungrier, that's all.
But maybe that don't matter.
Word is they're going to ship you back to Hayes.
And once you get there, they gonna hang you.
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.
Get up in there!
Spivey, what is that?
Looks like he's following us.
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.
Dang. You missed him.
- Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
- Wait. I seen him first.
- Get down!
- Look at that stupid bastard.
He ain't even moving.
- Wait a minute! That's my shot.
- Shoot him!
Shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.
Shoot him!
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!
Bauer, get him off him!
He might have killed you.
I'll get that son of a bitch.
Sit down, goddamn it!
That's it. I got him!
Dead shot, boys. Come on.
Son of a bitch!
Get up!
Get up!
I mean it! Get up!
Get up! Come on, get up!
What?
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.
You men get back here!
Goddamn it!
Boo.
Clear behind that stand of trees?
All right. Let's go.
I don't see nobody.
Indians!
No.
With Ten Bears, it was always more than a while.
There was purpose in everything he did and I knew he wanted me to stay.
But I was sure of myself.
I would be an excuse and that's all the army would need to find this place.
I pushed him as far as I could to move the camp...
but in the end he only smiled and talked of simple pleasures.
He reminded me that at his age a good fire is better than anything.
Ten Bears was an extraordinary man.
You have nothing to say?
What can I tell you?
What's ever on your mind.
You've made the decision.
My place is with you.
I go where you go.
You're not afraid?
No.
I told Ten Bears we'd leave when the snow breaks.
Did you tell everyone?
Not everyone.
You... finish your pipe?
Good pipe.
How... does it smoke?
I've never smoked it.
We come far... you and me.
I will not forget you.
Sergeant!
Over here! Now!
No, please! No! Please!
Davey!
- Come running, lad!
- Please don't!
- Stop it!
- Brand you like a damn steer!
- Bitch!
- No, please!
Hold the bitch! Hold her!
Hold her or I'll cut her tits off!
Go get Skinny! Quick!
Mike, don't!
Skinny!
Think it's funny?
Skinny, get the gun!
Get off of her, cowboy.
- They wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.
He says he'll shoot them.
I says, "You can't."
He says, "Get Little Bill."
I says, "He's sleeping."
But he don't care.
He'll shoot them boys soon.
She dying?
She'll live.
She didn't steal nothing or touch his poke.
When she seen his teensy little pecker...
...she giggled.
She didn't know no better.
Hang them, Little Bill.
Go to the office and get the bullwhip.
A whipping's all they get after what they done?
- It ain't no little thing.
- But what they done...
Alice!
Shut up!
- Whipping won't settle this.
- No?
Here's a contract between me and
Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.
I brought her from Boston, paid her expenses and all.
I got a contract that represents an investment of capital.
Property.
Damaged property.
Like if I hamstrung one of their ponies.
You think nobody'll fuck her now?
Hell, no!
Leastways, won't pay to do it!
Nobody's going to pay good money for a cut-up whore!
You boys are off the Bar T.
Got your own ponies?
Yeah, I got four.
Six.
Guess you want no trial, no fuss?
No, sir.
All right.
You did the cutting.
This fall, you bring in five ponies to Skinny.
Five?
And you...
...bring two.
- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.
The whip.
Maybe we don't need it now.
I'll tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies...
...I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?
I fined them instead, Alice.
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!
That ain't fair.
That ain't fair!
Haven't you seen enough blood tonight?
Hell, Alice...
...it ain't like they was tramps or loafers or...
...bad men. They were just...
...hardworking boys that were foolish.
- If they was wicked in a regular way...
- Like whores?
Tend to Delilah.
Go ahead.
I got $85.
I don't know.
If Delilah doesn't care, what are we so riled up about?
We let them smelly fools ride us like horses...
...doesn't mean we must let them brand us like horses.
Maybe we ain't nothing but whores, but...
...by God, we ain't horses!
I got $112.
That's everything.
And you, Faith?
240... dollars.
Jesus, what you been doing?
Giving Skinny something special?
She laughs.
With what Kate got, and Silky, me and Little Sue...
It ain't enough.
Not yet, maybe.
You don't look like no son-of-a- bitching cold-blooded assassin.
Say what?
You call yourself Mr. William Munny.
You have me confused with someone else, mister.
Shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Hey, Pa!
What, son?
Two more hogs got the fever.
You shot Charlie Pepper.
You killed William Harvey and robbed that train in Missouri.
Hold on.
Son, get those hogs separated there.
Penny, help your brother.
That one's sick too.
We'll talk inside.
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?
I thought you'd come to kill me for something I'd done in the old days.
I could have.
Easy.
I guess maybe so.
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell, cold-blooded damn killer.
Maybe I ain't.
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.
And if I wanted a partner for a killing...
...you were the worst one.
Meaning the best.
Because you're as cold as snow...
...and don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Pete said that?
He did.
I'm a killer myself, but I haven't killed as many as you...
...because of my youth.
Schofield Kid, they call me.
Why?
You from Schofield?
No, it's on account of my...
...Schofield-Smith & Wesson pistol.
How about it?
How about what?
How about being my partner?
I'm heading north in through Niobrara to Wyoming.
Kill two no-good cowboys.
For what?
For cutting up a lady.
Her face.
Cut her eyes out, her ears off.
They even cut her teets.
Jesus.
$1,000 reward, Will.
500 each.
I can't move those damn pigs!
Watch your cussing.
Do your best. Go to the pump and get cleaned up.
Come on.
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.
It was whiskey done it as much as anything else.
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.
My wife...
...cured me...
...of drink and...
...wickedness.
You don't look so prosperous.
You could buy her a new dress with your half.
You could buy your wife a fancy...
She's passed on.
Been gone near three years now.
Don't tell anyone about the reward.
I don't need no one else trying to collect.
Don't see no one.
Change your mind, you could catch me.
I'll ride due west for the trail headed north into Wyoming.
Let's separate those hogs.
Two others.
I think they got the fever.
Took you boys a while.
A few more days and I was going to call on the sheriff.
How about that?
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.
I bet. Get them horses to the livery.
Take that one over around the back.
Now here's a beauty.
You got my two. This one ain't yours.
We'll see about that.
Bastards! Get out of town!
Get out of here!
You are very sick sons-of-bitches!
Don't come back, butcher!
This here pony...
...I brung for the lady my partner cut.
She's the best.
Better than what I gave him.
She can sell her...
...or do what she wants.
A pony?
She ain't got no face left and you give her a mangy pony?
She ain't mangy!
Get out of here!
We don't need your goddamn charity!
Get out of our town and don't come back!
Get out of our town!
Did Pa use to kill folks?
I could tell your ma liked those flowers I gave her.
She ain't a saddle horse no more, Pa.
Ain't used to the feel.
Take care of your sister, son.
Kill a few chickens if you must and keep those hogs with fever separate.
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.
Ain't been in the saddle myself in a while.
She's getting even with me for the sins of my youth.
In my youth before I met your dear departed ma...
...I was weak and given to mistreating animals.
This horse and those hogs over there...
...are getting even for the cruelty I inflicted.
I used to be able to cuss and whip a horse like this...
...but your ma showed me the error of my ways.
I'll be back in 2 weeks.
The spirit of your dear departed ma watches over you.
- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!
Lying?
What if somebody comes to collect?
You going to hump them a thousand times?
The people come for that thousand won't tolerate you not having it!
They won't just cut up your face!
You stupid bitches.
Stupid bitches.
Shit!
Damn it! Jesus!
Get your finger?
Hello, Skinny.
You snuck up on me.
Like her?
I heard you done the roof yourself.
Roof?
Jesus, I did practically the whole damn thing myself.
The Roberts boy carried wood for me, but that's all.
What's that wood?
I'm building a porch here so I can sit of an evening and smoke my pipe...
...and drink coffee and watch the sunset.
Came out here just to take a look at her?
Them whores...
...been humping all them cowboys been through town the last two weeks.
Shit.
We got railroad barons and cattle barons.
You'll be the first billiard baron.
They been humping and telling every bowlegged one of them...
...they'll pay $1,000 to whoever...
...kills the two boys that cut up Delilah.
Those cowboys are riding that beef down to Kansas and Cheyenne?
All week long?
I didn't hear till last night myself.
The word's got all the way to Texas by now.
Nobody will come clear from Texas.
They got all that money?
Women can lie. Ask where the money is, they say they got none.
But the five of them could have it.
Maybe.
That much?
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
They'll just up and run anyhow, them two.
They'll stay out at the Bar T.
Close to their friends.
Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.
Got to go. I like your house.
It's Will.
Come in out of the sun.
See to Will's horse.
What you doing here?
Just thought I'd drop in on you.
We ain't bad men no more.
We're farmers.
Should be easy killing them, if they don't go on down to Texas.
How long since you fired a gun at a man, Will? Ten years?
Eleven.
Easy, huh?
It wasn't all that easy even back then.
And we were young and full of beans.
If you was mad at them...
...over some wrong, I could see shooting them.
We done stuff for money before.
We thought we did.
What'd these fellows do?
Cheat at cards? Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?
They cut up a woman.
Cut her face, cut her eyes out, cut her fingers off, cut her tits.
Everything but her cunny, I suppose.
I'll be dogged.
Guess they got it coming.
Of course, Will...
...if Claudia was alive, you wouldn't do this.
Could you look in on my youngsters next week?
Got some hogs to separate.
How long will you be gone?
Two weeks, I guess.
What's this Kid like?
Three ways?
I see you still have that Spencer rifle.
And I can still knock the eye out of a bird flying.
Jesus.
He must be moving right along.
We'll come across him tomorrow, I reckon.
Got used to my bed.
This ain't going to be like home.
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.
Hell, I'm sorry.
Don't fret it. It ain't nothing.
She don't like it much...
...you riding off with me.
Gave me the evil eye.
You know, Sally's Indian and...
...lndians ain't over-friendly.
I don't blame her.
I won't hold it against her.
She knew me back then.
She knew what a...
...no-good son-of-a-bitch I was.
She ain't allowing that I changed.
She don't realize I ain't like that no more.
- You know women.
- I ain't the same, Ned.
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.
Going on this killing...
...don't mean I'll go back to the way I was.
Just need the money.
Get a new start for them youngsters.
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...
...and his teeth came out the back of his head?
I think about him now and again.
He didn't do anything to deserve to get shot.
At least nothing I remembered when I sobered up.
You was one crazy son-of-a-bitch.
No one liked me.
The boys all thought I'd shoot them out of pure meanness.
You ain't like that no more.
Eagle, he hated my guts.
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.
Quincy neither, I reckon.
Quincy used to just watch all the time.
Scared.
Like I said...
...you ain't like that no more.
That's right.
I'm just a fellow now.
I ain't no different than anyone else.
No more.
What son-of-a-bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?
No, sir.
The would-be assassin is a gentleman of French ancestry. Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense, but...
...the French are known to be a race of assassins...
...who can't shoot worth a damn.
Any Frenchmen present are excluded, of course.
Says here a fellow by the name of Guiteau.
Sure as hell sounds like a John Bull to me.
Again, I don't wish to give offense...
...when I suggest that this country select...
...a king or even a queen, rather than a President.
One isn't that quick to shoot a king or a queen.
The majesty of royalty, you see.
Maybe you don't wish to give offense, sir...
...but you are giving it pretty thick.
This country don't need no queens whatsoever.
- When I heard about queens...
- Shut up, Joe.
What's wrong with you? This dude...
Might be this dude here is English Bob.
Works for the railroad shooting Chinamen.
Might be waiting for some cowboy...
...to touch his pistol so he can shoot him.
Is that a fact, mister?
You English Bob?
Pheasants.
Let's shoot some pheasants.
Ten shots.
And let's say $1 a pheasant.
I'll shoot for the Queen, and you for...
...whomever.
That's 8 for me and 1 for you.
That comes to 7 American dollars.
Pretty damn good shooting...
...for a John Bull.
No doubt your aim was affected by your grief...
...over the injury to your President.
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.
Does what?
Induces people to shoot persons in high places.
It's a savage country, really.
That's the second one they shot in 20 years.
It's uncivilized shooting persons of substance.
Thank you.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
The law obliges you to surrender all sidearms...
...to the proper authorities during your visit.
Proper authority?
I can assure you...
...that neither my companion or
I carry firearms on our person.
We rely upon the goodwill of our fellow man and the...
...forbearance of reptiles.
Unarmed, my ass.
Christ, it's hot.
If I'm going to get shot, I'd rather it was hot than cold.
Everything hurts me more when it's cold.
- If you hit your thumb...
- Shut up, Fatty!
- I only said...
- Clyde's back.
- With Little Bill?
- No.
Shit.
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.
Where's Little Bill, for chrissake?
Building his damn porch.
Building his porch?
If you got shot, would you want it to be a hot or cold day?
I ain't going to get shot.
He's coming?
Of course he's coming.
I just loaded that.
I don't trust nobody to load my guns for a shooting.
What he say?
Little Bill said he was building his porch.
You seen that thing?
It was all loaded.
You got three pistols and you only got one arm!
I don't want to get killed for lack of shooting back.
He don't have a straight angle on that whole porch!
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.
He didn't say nothing?
Asked what they looked like.
Maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Maybe he ain't so tough.
Seem like he was scared?
Little Bill? Him scared?
We never seen him up against any like these ones.
Killers.
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.
He worked them tough towns.
Just wondered.
Anybody could be scared.
He wasn't scared, boys.
He just ain't no carpenter.
There's a dignity in royalty which precludes the likelihood of assassination.
If you pointed a pistol at a queen...
...your hands would shake as if palsied.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.
Always a wise policy.
But if you did, I can assure you...
...the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed.
You would stand, how should I put it...
...in awe.
Now, a President...
Well, why not shoot the President?
Keep the change.
This Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.
Say you want a game of billiards.
Billiards?
Even though I don't wish to play?
No matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Right.
Quite right.
Mr. Beauchamp, I think a cup of tea...
Hello, Bob.
Boys, this here is English Bob.
Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time.
Run out of Chinamen?
I thought that you were dead.
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.
I was tasting the soup two hours after I ate it.
Actually, what I heard was you...
...fell off your horse.
Drunk, of course.
And that you broke your bloody neck.
I heard that one myself, Bob.
Hell, I even thought I was dead.
Till I found out I was just in Nebraska.
Who's he?
W.W. Beauchamp.
This is Little Bill Daggett.
And friends, of course.
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?
In person.
You work for the railroads too?
I write.
Letters?
Books, Bill. Books.
Actually...
...he's my biographer.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
It's only a book.
A book?
That means you boys can read.
That means you saw the signs...
...saying surrender your firearms.
But like you told young Andy...
...you're not armed, are you?
Not really, Bill.
Got a Peacemaker, but that wouldn't worry you, would it?
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.
I'm afraid so, Bob.
I don't like firearms around.
Be very careful with it, sonny.
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.
Make sure you don't get wet.
No shit.
All he's got is writing stuff and this book.
"The Duck of Death?"
Duke.
"The Duke."
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'll have that.32, Bob.
Now, Little Bill.
You will leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Enemies?
You been talking about the Queen again?
On Independence Day?
I guess you think I'm kicking you.
But it ain't so!
What I'm doing is talking!
Hear?!
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!
To all those villains in Missouri!
And those villains...
...down in Cheyenne!
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!
Even if there was, they don't want to come for it...
...anyhow!
What are you looking at?!
Go on!
Mind your own business!
Ever go into town?
On occasion.
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.
I mean, get yourself a woman.
No, I never go into town for that.
A man like me?
Only woman I could get is one I'd have to pay for.
That ain't right, buying flesh.
Claudia, rest her soul, wouldn't want me doing that.
Me being a father, and all.
You just use your hand?
I don't miss it all that much.
Goddamn, somebody's shooting at us!
You hit?
I bumped my head falling off my horse.
Ain't shooting at us no more.
Shooting way over yonder.
What the hell's he shooting at?
Beats the hell out of me.
Reckon we in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothing planted.
Shooting at us again.
He's shooting at the whole horizon.
Wait! You'll mark us!
Hey, Kid!
That's the Kid shooting at us?
Kid, it's me! Will Munny!
What the hell's he shooting at us for?
That you?
Yeah, it's me!
Don't go shooting at us no more! You hear me?
Who the hell you got with you, Will?
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?
We'll get our horses and come on over there.
You ain't going to shoot, are you?
I ain't!
Chased that horse a damn mile.
- What was you shooting at us for?
- I thought you was following me.
We was. You said if I changed my mind...
Wasn't nothing said about no partner.
This here's Ned Logan.
He's the Schofield Kid, nephew to Pete Sothow.
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.
We never talked about no other fellow.
There's two cowboys. Better there's three of us, if they got friends.
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.
Better than you, anyhow.
- You wasn't even coming close.
- Hands off!
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.
It ain't... bent.
You were shooting all over creation!
You'll share your half with him?
I figure three ways.
Wrong.
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.
You going back with him?
He's my partner.
He don't go, I don't.
What's it come to, three ways?
Shit!
What are you pissing on about?
What are you looking at?
Looking at?
Clouds.
He's looking at them clouds on account of we got a storm coming.
I seen them.
You was smart to change your mind.
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.
See that hawk?
I could hit it with one shot.
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.
There ain't no hawk, Kid.
You can't see for shit, can you?
See your canteen?
How far can you see?
Far enough.
- We ain't going to shoot canteens!
- How far? 100 yards?
More.
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.
- He's blind, Will!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!
Hold it!
How far can you see, Kid? 50 yards?
You bet your ass I can see 50 yards, Will.
I can see well enough to shoot this son-of-a-bitch.
Hold on.
Hear that, Ned?
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.
Jesus.
Fifty yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.
They look like real hard cases, Bob.
Did you kill all 7 of them?
Or just wing some of them?
That you here embalmed on the cover?
"The Duck of Death?"
The Duke.
"The Duke of Death."
You always were good with a pistol, but 7 of them? Boy!
Protecting that woman.
How the hell do you do that?
It's desirable in the publishing business to take a certain...
...liberty when depicting the cover scene.
For reasons involving the marketplace.
From what I read, the writing's not that much different than the picture.
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...
...that the events described are taken from eyewitness accounts.
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.
Like the Duck himself, I guess.
The Duke.
Duck, I says.
"'You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran'...
...said the Duck.
'You must apologize.'
But Two-Gun Corcoran would none of it.
Cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed him...
...but the Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking six-guns."
I consider that an accurate depiction of events.
There is a certain poetry to the language which I couldn't resist.
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...
...the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran.
I didn't see you there...
...nor no woman...
...nor two-gun shooters.
Nor none of this.
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was there.
First off...
...Corky never carried two guns, though he should have.
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun.
But not because he had two pistols.
He had a dick that was so big...
...it was longer than the barrel on his Walker Colt.
The only insulting he did was stick that thing...
...into a French lady
English Bob was sweet on.
The night Corky walked into the Blue Bottle...
...before he knows what's what,
Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky, and he did the wrong thing.
In his hurry, he shot his damn toe off.
Meantime, Bob here...
...aims real good and squeezes off another...
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!
He hits this thousand-dollar mirror over the bar.
The Duck of Death is as good as dead...
...because Corky does it right.
He aims real careful.
No hurry...
The Walker Colt blew up in his hand...
...a failing common to that model.
If Corky'd had two guns instead of just a big dick...
...he'd have defended himself to the end.
Wait a minute.
English Bob killed him when he didn't even have...
Bob wasn't going to wait for
Corky to grow a new hand.
No, he just walked over there real slow...
...'cause he's drunk...
...and shot him through the liver.
I don't like rocks on my dad-gum back.
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dad-gum bed!
You'll miss your dad-gum roof next, I suppose.
Will?
That business up in Jackson County...
...that really happen?
The way they say it happened?
What business?
Two deputies up close pointing their rifles right at you.
Got you dead to rights.
You pulled out your pistol and blew them to hell.
Only took a scratch yourself.
Uncle Pete never seen nothing like you shooting your way out of that scrape.
Well, I don't recollect.
You don't recollect?
Right.
Ned...
...how many men you killed?
Ain't you going to answer?
What the hell's that to you?
I got to know what kind of fellow I'm riding with, case we get into a scrape.
How many men you killed, Kid?
Five.
How many?
Five.
I done killed 5 of them.
That's including a Mexican who come at me with a knife.
Why don't you shut up? Get some rest.
You boys're as crotchety as a couple of old hens.
Actually...
...Mr. Corcoran was faster on the draw than the Duck...
Than English Bob?
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have shot himself in the toe.
He would've killed old Bob.
Being a good shot and being quick with a pistol...
...don't do no harm, but it don't mean much next to being cool-headed.
A man who'll keep his head, not get rattled under fire...
...like as not will kill you.
But if the other fellow is quicker...
Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.
Look.
That's as fast as I can draw, aim and hit anything more than 10 feet away.
'Less it's a barn.
But if he doesn't miss?
He'll kill you.
That's why there's so few dangerous men around like Bob.
Like me.
It ain't so easy to shoot a man if he's shooting back.
That'll flat rattle some folks.
- I'll show you something.
- Wait.
Look.
Take that.
Take it.
There's the key.
Just shoot me...
...and you and Bob can ride on out of here free as birds.
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.
You got to cock it.
Cock it.
Point it.
Go on. Point it.
Now all you must do is pull the trigger.
Hot, ain't it?
Your finger wasn't even on the trigger.
What if...
What if I gave it to him?
Do it.
You don't...
Do it.
I guess he don't want it, Mr. Beauchamp.
You were right not to take it.
I'd have killed you.
We could use some rain.
You no-good goddamn pig-fucking whore!
Sorry, horse.
I brung this for when we kill them fellows.
Figured we could use some now.
Not me. I don't touch it no more.
It's raining.
I know it's raining!
Give some to the Kid.
You think that Kid really killed 5 men?
When you talked about the time them deputies had the drop on you and Pete...
I remember there was
3 men you shot, not 2.
I ain't like that no more, Ned!
I ain't no crazy killing fool.
Still think it'll be easy to kill them cowboys?
If we don't drown first.
Give these keys to the conductor.
He can loose Bob's cuffs as soon as he's outside the county.
Got my pistols?
I guess you know, Bob, that...
...if I see you again I'll just shoot in self-defense.
I didn't steal your biographer!
He's staying on his own account!
He can go stuff himself as well, can't he?!
A plague on the whole stinking lot of you!
Without morals or laws!
And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!
It's no wonder you all emigrated to America!
They wouldn't have you in England!
You're a lot of savages!
You're all a bunch of bloody savages! A curse on you!
Nobody's going to come...
...after what Little Bill done to that Englishman.
Delilah, can't you get them tables clean?
Cover your face, somebody might hump you and you wouldn't have to clean.
What do they call that face cover?
A veil.
Yeah. Get a veil!
Rain's coming.
Thank God.
Sure?
You all right, Will?
Fellow asking for Alice.
Tonight? You ain't joshing?
This way, mister.
Must be randy as hell to come out in this shit.
"No, no! You're wrong,
Little Bill!" he said.
"That's not the Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!"
He had changed it over.
And I said to him...
..."Jim, you're a liar and a horse thief!"
He saw nobody would help him none.
He went to start crying and sobbing and just carrying on.
He said, "God, please, don't kill me, Bill!
Please don't kill me!"
I said, "It makes me sick..."
Open the window.
"...to see a man carrying two pistols and a Henry rifle...
...and crying like a damn baby."
So... you killed him?
No.
But I should have.
I can't abide them kind.
You see them in the taverns.
Tramps and drunk teamsters.
Crazed miners.
Sporting their pistols and acting like they was bad men.
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.
I do not like assassins.
Or men of low character.
Like English Bob.
But Bob was no coward, you know.
He wouldn't cry and carry on like that...
Sheriff...
I don't have any more receptacles.
Maybe you should just hang the carpenter.
I meant that because of the... if you hang...
Never mind.
What the hell?
On a night like this!
Who is it?
Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.
Three fellows just come into town, Bill.
They're down to Greely's.
There's two of them got guns.
What the hell's keeping that Kid?
You suppose he's up...
You look like shit.
You remember Eagle Hendershot?
I saw him.
Will, he's dead.
No, I saw him, Ned.
His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.
Jesus.
You got a fever.
- Take your drink.
- Worms were coming out.
I'll go find the Kid.
Must be he's getting an advance on one of the sporting ladies.
If I was to...
If it worked out that I could...
...take a little time for myself, would you...
I guess you don't want to come.
Give me the pistol.
I says give me over your pistol.
I ain't drunk.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to my office...
...day or night.
I guess you didn't see the sign, because of the weather.
No.
But I ain't armed.
Your friends upstairs got any pistols?
They ain't armed either.
Spilled your whiskey.
What's your name?
William...
...Hendershot.
Well, Mr. William Hendershot...
...what if I was to say you was a no-good liar?
And if I was to say you shit in your pants because of a cowardly soul...
...I bet you'd show me that pistol right quick and shoot me dead.
Is that so?
Maybe, I guess.
But the fact...
...is I ain't...
...carrying no firearm.
Get up.
What's this for, snakes and such?
We don't have any snakes in here, Mr. Hendershot.
It ain't loaded.
Powder's wet.
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?
Such is the trash I spoke of!
They're in all the saloons...
...in all your prosperous communities!
Wichita!
Over in Cheyenne!
Abilene!
But not in the town of Big Whiskey.
Hurry!
Know what to tell Little Bill?
Look sharp for that lone pine.
Don't miss it.
Not the shirt! Put his boots on!
What are we going to do about Will?
Come on! Let's hope them horses are still there!
Let the man out, W.W.
He's desiring to leave the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him.
Easy. She's got to be able to turn a dollar a time!
How come they lit out the back window?
They seen you beating on their friend.
They just come for the billiards, honest.
Billiards?!
They just passing through here?
Going to Fort Buford.
You kicked the shit out of an innocent man.
Innocent?
Innocent of what?
You done this before?
Plenty of times.
His pistol must've jammed.
Bring that candle in closer.
I can't see.
He wouldn't take no beating if it hadn't jammed.
He wouldn't give it over and not shoot.
He don't look so good.
He didn't even pull his pistol?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
I'd have pulled my pistol.
You did!
Out of the lady and out the window!
- That was your idea! I wanted to...
- We must go.
Already? Darling, I'm ready for another advance.
- You'll use it all up.
- No more advances on what you ain't done.
Sweetheart, we're just waiting on this weather to clear!
We'll need more food!
3 days' worth.
3 days?
- We'll kill them tomorrow.
- I don't kill nobody without him.
We don't need him! We can do it.
He ain't nothing but a broken-down pig farmer.
One of us'll bring food and some whiskey in the morning!
And some medicine if you got any!
Don't it make you sick hearing him?
Don't you ladies worry!
Me and Ned will kill them two sons-of-bitches for you!
Claudia.
She's not here.
Is that you, Ned?
I've seen him.
I saw the Angel of Death.
I've seen the river, Ned.
He's got snake eyes.
Who's got snake eyes?
It's the Angel of Death.
Ned, I'm scared of dying.
Easy, partner.
I seen Claudia too.
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?
Her face was all covered with worms.
Ned, I'm scared.
I'm dying.
No, don't tell nobody.
Don't tell my kids...
...none of the things I did. Hear me?
All right.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Maybe.
Suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
You mean will I help you kill them cowboys?
I can't spot them myself.
But you could.
You could spot that big bastard a half-mile off.
And if I spot him?
Then I ride up close and shoot him.
Just like that?
I'm a damn killer. I done it before.
I'm more of a killer than he is.
I thought you was an angel.
You ain't dead.
Some big fellow...
...kicked the hell out of me.
I must look like you now.
You don't look nothing like me.
No offense meant.
It was you those cowboys cut up.
My partners, Ned and that Kid...
...they around?
They went out scouting when your fever broke.
Scouting?
Out to the Bar T...
...looking for them.
How long I been here?
Three days.
Are you hungry or...
Three days?
I should be.
I thought I was gone.
I wouldn't normally pay no notice to high country like this.
Trees. But I'm sure noticing now.
Thought I was dying for sure.
I brought your hat.
You left it down at Greely's.
Thanks.
That sheriff...
...still looking for me?
Little Bill?
No, he thinks you went south.
Are you really going to kill them cowboys?
I guess.
Still a payment coming, isn't there?
The other two, your friends...
...they're taking advances on the payment.
Advances?
Free ones.
Alice and Silky been giving them free ones.
I see.
Would you like a free one?
I guess not.
I didn't mean with me. I meant...
...Alice and Silky would give you a free one...
...if you wanted.
That's all I meant.
I didn't mean I didn't want a free one because you been cut up.
What I said about you looking like me ain't true.
You ain't ugly like me.
It's just that we both have scars.
You're a beautiful woman and if I wanted a free one...
...I'd want it with you more than the other two.
It's just that...
...I can't on account of my wife.
Your wife?
I admire you for that...
...being true to your wife.
I've known a lot of men...
...who weren't.
I suppose.
Is she back in Kansas?
She's watching over my young ones.
Hang on!
Get the damn iron!
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!
I'm pinned, boys!
Better finish him.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
He got the boy's horse.
Finish him before he gets clear.
Get behind them rocks.
Get over there!
What happened?
He ain't killed?!
What's going on?
He gets in those rocks, we won't get him.
- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?
Shoot!
I ain't very good with one of these.
Keep going, Davey! The rocks!
Get him?
Where is he?
How many more shots do I have?
How many more shots do I have?
Two.
Did you get him?
Here, reload this.
- You missed him.
- I got him.
He ain't killed.
Maybe, maybe not.
Got him through the gut, I think.
Think he'll die?
We killed him?
We killed him...
...I guess.
I'm dying, boys!
Then you shouldn't have cut up no woman, you asshole!
Jesus, I'm so thirsty.
Give me some water, please!
Please, Slim!
I'm bleeding, Slim!
Give him a drink of water, goddamn it!
Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't going to shoot!
You won't?
Hold on, Davey-boy!
Here I come now!
Don't shoot, you bastards!
Shit!
They take him water?
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!
Hold on now!
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!
When do we double back?
After a ways.
Not me.
I'm heading back down to Kansas.
We must kill the other one first.
With any luck, we'll find him by nightfall or in the morning.
We'll shoot him and head back with the money.
Want the Spencer?
It's no time to quit.
- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!
I'll see you, Will. So long, Kid.
I ain't no good with that damn thing.
Me and the Kid'll go over to that ranch and when we find him we'll shoot him.
We'll meet up with you, get our money, and head south together.
Suppose he don't go back to the ranch?
He ain't going into town.
He won't stay out in the open country.
He'll hole up at that ranch.
I ain't waiting.
I'll look in on your young ones.
Forget what the Kid said about the money and all.
I'll bring yours.
Kid's full of shit.
Doing some repairs up here.
They killed one of them cowboys.
Shit.
Parsons said he saw three men, right after sun-up, headed east.
One was on a dun and another was on a flea-bitten grey.
He didn't know what the third one was on, maybe an Appaloosa.
Amos says to ask if the county will pay for feed for all the horses.
Witherspoon won't sell us no more
.30-30 shells without we pay.
Use my dogs.
Then the county must take responsibility.
Fatty, get on out there to the Bar
T and make sure that other cowboy...
...stays put and don't expose himself.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Think they come clear from Kansas to fuck us?
But that Kid's just a boy and the other one...
...Will, the nice one, being so true to his wife...
Wife? He ain't got no wife.
- Yes, he does. He said...
- He ain't got no wife.
Not above ground, anyways.
Murdering whores!
He had it coming...
...for what he done.
And the other one too!
Both of them for what they done!
We got one!
We got one, Sheriff! Out by Cow Creek!
Is he alive?
Yeah! Bunch of us from
Bar T went out looking...
...'cause they killed one of our own.
Come across the bastard on a roan heading south.
He admit it?
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.
They messing him up?
Little bit.
Get out there. Find out what happened to those other two!
See anything out there, Buck?
Hell, yes! Seen about 200 fellows packing rifles.
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.
I said, "How much?" They says,
"Five." I said, "Dollars?"
They said, "Cents."
I said, "Sold."
Well, I ain't worried!
'Cause I got me some protection.
- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.
Names?
Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.
Bring him in.
You'll want to tell me and Mr. Beauchamp here...
...all about your two villainous friends.
I'll want the names and whereabouts of those murderous son-of-a-bitches.
Sure is ripe.
Going to get a lot riper.
Think he's still in there?
He's in there.
He's holding on to his shit like it was money.
He's in there.
Tell me right off if you see him.
You won't shoot him your own self?
You can shoot him.
You, Mr. Quincy and... what was the young fellow's name?
Elroy Tate.
No, that's not what you said.
It is.
No, you said...
..."Elroy Quincy out of Medicine Hat and...
...Henry Tate out of Cheyenne."
Hell if I did.
Hell if I did.
Go get them whores that fucked these boys that night.
Strawberry Alice and Silky?
Go on and get them!
Them whores will tell different lies than you.
And when their lies ain't the same as your lies...
I ain't going to hurt no woman.
But I will hurt you.
Not gentle like before...
...but bad.
Where you going?
- The shithouse.
- Let me finish this hand.
To protect me while I take a dump?
- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.
- I'll go with him.
- You can wipe my ass, Thirsty.
Hell with him. He ain't polite, he should get shot.
That him?
Yeah, it's him.
Go get him. He's all yours.
Assassins!
Shoot!
Come on, goddamn it!
Get him?
Cover me.
- I can't see them!
- Just shoot!
Get him!
Was it like that in the old days?
Everybody riding out, shooting...
...smoke all over, folks yelling, bullets whizzing by?
I guess so.
Shit, I thought they'd get us.
I was even scared a little.
For a minute.
You ever scared in them days?
I can't remember.
I was drunk most of the time.
I shot that fucker three times!
He went for his pistol and I blazed away.
First shot...
...I got him right in the chest.
That was the first.
First what?
First one I ever killed.
I know I said I shot five men.
It weren't true.
That Mexican who had a knife...
...I busted his leg with a shovel.
I didn't kill him or nothing.
You killed the hell out of that fellow today.
Hell, yeah!
I killed the hell out of him!
Three shots while he took a shit...
Take a drink.
It don't seem real.
How he won't never breathe again, ever.
How he's dead.
And the other one too.
On account of pulling a trigger.
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.
You take away all he's got...
...and all he'll ever have.
I guess they had it coming.
We all have it coming, Kid.
I was watching you.
You weren't followed.
Silky and Faith rode off to the east and two deputies followed them.
Want to help me count this?
- I trust you.
- Don't go trusting me too much.
In fact, we'll give
Ned his share together.
You'll know I ain't holding out on you.
Ned's share?
He went south. We'll catch up.
He's dead.
What do you mean?
He went south yesterday. He ain't dead.
They killed him. I thought you knew.
Nobody killed Ned!
He didn't kill anyone, he went south!
Why would anybody kill Ned?
Who killed him?
Little Bill.
The boys caught him. Little Bill...
...beat him up.
He was making him answer questions and beating him up, then Ned just died.
They got a sign on him says he was a killer.
A sign?
In front of Greely's.
A sign on him in front of Greely's!
These questions he was asking...
...what were they?
About where you and him was.
Then what?
A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse at the Bar T.
So Little Bill killed him for what we done?
Not on purpose.
But he started hurting him worse.
Making him tell stuff.
First, Ned wouldn't talk.
Then Little Bill hurt him so bad, he said who you was.
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri...
Little Bill said, "The same William Munny...
...who dynamited the railroad in '69, killing women and children?"
Ned said you done a lot worse and was...
...more cold-blooded than William Bonney.
Said if he hurt Ned again, you'd come kill him...
...like you killed the
U.S. Marshal in '70.
That didn't scare him, did it?
No, sir.
Give me your Schofield.
Why?
Give it.
You keep it.
I won't use it.
I won't kill nobody no more.
I ain't like you, Will.
You better ride on back, Miss.
Keep all of it. It's yours.
What about spectacles and fancy clothes?
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead.
You don't have to worry, Kid.
I ain't going to kill you.
You're the only friend I got.
Take this money and give my share...
...and Ned's share to my kids.
Tell them if I ain't back in a week, to give half to Sally Two Trees.
You keep the rest. Get them spectacles.
You'll go kill Little Bill?
Stay clear of folks you see.
A lot will want to hang you.
Get going.
I'll say this just one more time, so don't ask me again!
Those on the posse today got one drink coming from the county budget!
And those who rode yesterday get another drink.
Hold it!
That's two!
After that, it comes out of your own pocket!
We'll pull out early in the morning.
We'll chase them clear to Texas, so don't spend too much money.
We'll divide up into four parties!
We'll hit all the farms and trails...
...in a big circle.
We're bound to find somebody...
...who seen these skunks.
Who owns this shithole?
Fat man.
Speak up.
I own this establishment.
I bought it from Greely for a thousand dollars.
Clear out of there.
Hold it!
Sir, you are a cowardly son-of-a-bitch!
You just shot an unarmed man.
He should've armed himself if he's going to decorate his saloon with my friend.
You'd be William Munny out of Missouri...
...killer of women and children.
That's right.
I've killed women and children.
I killed just about everything that walks or crawls.
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.
For what you did to Ned.
You boys better move away.
Gentlemen...
...he's got one barrel left.
When he fires that, use your pistols...
...and shoot him down like the mangy scoundrel he is!
Misfire! Kill the son-of-a-bitch!
Any man don't want to get killed, better clear on out the back.
I'm shot! I've been shot!
You ain't shot.
I don't have a gun. I am not armed.
Pick up that rifle.
Pick it up.
Shells too.
You killed Little Bill.
You ain't armed?
I'm not. I don't have a gun.
I've never had a gun. I'm a writer!
A writer?
- Letters and such?
- Books.
Books.
I don't believe it, you killed five men. Single-handed.
That's a Spencer rifle, right?
Who'd you kill first?
"When confronted by superior numbers...
...an experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shot first."
Little Bill said that.
You probably killed him first.
I was lucky in the order.
I'm always lucky when it comes to killing folks.
Who was next? Clyde, right?
You killed Clyde, or was it Deputy Andy...
All I can tell you is who'll be last.
I don't deserve this...
...to die like this.
I was building a house.
"Deserve's" got nothing to do with it.
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.
All right, I'm coming out!
Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!
Anyone takes a shot at me...
...I'll not only kill him, but his wife...
...and all his friends...
...and burn his damn house down!
Nobody better shoot!
Charley, go ahead. Shoot him!
Hell, no! I ain't no deputy!
You better bury Ned right!
You better not cut up nor otherwise harm no whores!
Or I'll come back and kill every one of you sons-of-bitches.
Anita!
Coming.
Ready? Open the door!
Oh, I've been saving up for you for a long time!
Come on, honey!
I'm a-waiting!
Happy birthday, Colonel.
Oh, darlin', darlin'.
Let's raise the flag on the flagpole today, huh?
You know the rules.
No sidearms upstairs.
Birthday kiss. Yeah.
Take off your coat and stay awhile.
Come on, darlin'.
- A toast.
- A toast?
- A toast.
- Yeah, give me a drink. Sure.
Oh, you're such a pig.
Ah, yeah! Oink, oink, oink!
- You're one of the best.
- One year better and one year older.
Now, darlin', what do you say, huh?
We're here to have a good time.
Come on! Come on!
I'll grab you, all right!
Come here, you. Here I go.
- Whoo.
- That kiss now.
- You don't want to do business with me, Colonel.
- I want that kiss!
Where you goin'?
- There they go again.
- What the hell's goin' on?
God-fearin' citizens of this fine town...
...ain't it about time we stop lettin'...
...the sad morality of a pernicious few sinners...
...bring shame upon us all?
Time to put a stop to the drinkin'...
- Yeah!
- And the gamblin'...
And the whorin'...
...right under our very noses.
Hey, preacher. You come up here.
We think we might could change your mind.
Man's entitled to a drink every once in a while.
My father, he'd have his drink on Saturday nights.
Worked hard all week long.
There's nothing wrong with that.
They say it says in the Bible...
You had two already.
Whoa! Hold on there! Where are you going?
We didn't finish yet.
- You've had too much to drink.
- I ain't got my birthday kiss yet.
You're gonna plant it right here, honey.
You... Come on now.
I'm gonna take you to...
- It's all right. Come on.
- Come on, darlin'...
- That's the one I wanted.
- Oh, boy.
- You stay away from me.
- No, whore!
Cody! Cody!
- Help me!
- Damn whore!
Now keep your hands off her, Colonel.
I paid for a goddamn birthday kiss!
I'm gonna get one!
You touch her again, you're a dead man.
She shot him!
The whore shot the colonel!
Get her!
Harlot! Get her!
She shot the colonel! She shot him!
Get her! Get her!
You okay?
The good Lord sayeth an eye for an eye, a life for a life.
Lord, let this jezebel be damned to death!
Harlot, you cannot escape the wrath of our Lord!
I accuse you ofharlotry.
I accuse you of destroying the sanctity of marriage.
I accuse you ofbringing sin and disease to this town.
You have blackened the sun and bloodied the moon!
- String her up.
- I accuse you of having a scorpion between your legs...
...that destroys man's covenant with God!
Cleanse yourself with death!
Free yourself from your sinful enslavement!
Just get on with it.
And let us pray.
O God...
Jesus has said...
...every tree is known by its fruits.
This woman has brought forth bad fruit.
And we pray unto you today, Lord, to bless us...
- As we rid our fair community of this woman.
- Hyah! Hyah!
This abomination.
This scarlet temptress...
- who is ruining our town.
- Get out of the way!
I say unto her, the day of wrath is at hand.
Seems more like a lifetime than three years.
I'm not exactly...
...your blushing bride anymore.
I know you don't hold it against me, but I do.
At least I never let another man kiss me.
I'll always have you in my heart.
If nothing else, at least that's sacred.
Let's go. If we don't put ground between us and Echo City, we won't be going anywhere.
Hey there. We're with the Pinkerton
Detective Agency. Wonder if you could help us.
We're looking for a Miss Mathilda Clayborne.
That's her in the buggy.
Thank you.
But they...
They are way the hell...
...out of my jurisdiction by now, Mrs. Clayborne.
If you were anything more than a pile of manure with a badge on it...
...my colonel might still be alive.
Well, I didn't put no gun to your mister's head...
...and make him jump that whore!
Bitch.
We came as soon as we got the wire, ma'am.
Sorry about your husband.
You're wasting time. I'm hiring you because what passes for the law around here...
...won't leave this jurisdiction.
I want that filthy harlot killed or brought back to me, no matter what.
I had these drawn up.
That's just a taste of what you'll get when you bring her back.
Sonny, you want to get our mounts off the horsecar back of the train.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you worry, ma'am.
You just point us which way they went.
We'll track 'em all right.
Okay. Lift it. Higher.
Okay. Ease it down.
That should do it.
Cody!
The wagon!
You all right, sweet pea?
Well, might as well eat this too.
Yeah. You can't tell the one meat from the other.
Yeah, just like men.
So, are we gonna find another saloon somewhere?
I'm finished with that.
So am I.
What have you got there?
Is that a stock certificate?
It's a homesteader's claim to 640 acres in the Oregon Territory.
- Jim and I had it together. It's what we came out west for.
- What's it worth?
A lot of hard work, and then what you gotta farm unless the bank takes it away.
We were gonna start a sawmill.
A sawmill?
Yeah. All the settling out here now...
...means more schools and saloons, churches, houses.
- That means lumber.
- Now how come you never told us about this before?
I don't know. I...
I didn't know how I was gonna do it all by myself.
What I mean to say is I'd like it if...
...you-all would go in with me.
Together we could do it.
We could run a business.
A sawmill?
We sold our bodies.
Why can't we sell some wood?
Might as well cook that thing some more. Ain't gonna hurt to burn it none.
I suppose not.
Takes money.
Building a sawmill takes money.
I know. I'm probably just dreaming...
...but it's the closest thing to a plan we've got.
Well, it could be I got some.
In Agua Dulce.
Been wiring it there for years.
Over $12,000 now.
Wha... Tw...
What are you saying?
I'm saying sawmill.
Why the hell not?
Yeah. Why the hell not?
A sawmill.
Well, as long as I don't have to get any splinters in my fingers.
Oh, Eileen.
This stuff's... Raunchy.
That's why they call it rotgut.
Oh, it hits you quick.
Maybe a day old.
They was pullin' a wagon.
If it don't rain, won't be hard picking 'em up.
Morning, ma'am.
Now don't go firing that thing.
I just want to show you something.
I must say the likeness doesn't do you justice.
Yeah. That's me all right.
Uh, my name's McCoy. Joshua McCoy.
Where are you headed, Mr. McCoy?
I'm a prospector, see.
These hills are too picked-over.
I... Thought I'd make my way up north.
I've seen prospectors.
You don't look like a prospector.
Oh, I am. Truly am.
I'm countin' on making a big strike soon.
Soon as I get some things taken care of.
Now you wouldn't be thinking this reward here would be part of your stake, would you?
No, ma'am. I'm just riding in the same direction as you.
All right. Put on your hat and be on your way, Mr. McCoy.
Only if you put your clothes on.
- Get movin'.
- Ma'am.
One more thing. They put Pinkertons on your trail. You best keep movin'.
Pack everything on horseback.
We're leaving the wagon.
What about all our things?
Leave 'em. We gotta be in Agua Dulce by tomorrow.
- Yes. May I help you?
- Yeah.
I want to buy a dress.
Um, just what kind of dress did you have in mind?
One of them ready-to-wear kind like you see in that Sears catalog.
I really think a woman like you would be happier shopping someplace else.
Hyah! Come on. Hyah!
Morning, ma'am.
Good day, Mr. Landaker.
- I believe you dropped this, madam.
- Oh, why, thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.
- I'm new here. If it wouldn't be too much trouble...
...could you suggest a respectable place...
...where I might have a meal and a decent libation?
Now, I just might know of such a place.
How dare you cast such lewd and salacious aspersions...
...upon my person.
But that might be interesting.
Eileen, you don't gotta whore yourself...
...at the first old fart that comes along.
- Silly child.
- Tramps, the both of you!
Ah, Lilly!
Can't you tell I...
I was just trying to get somethin'...
...passable to eat.
Oh, yeah? And I'm Wyatt Earp.
Can I have a kiss, Wyatt Earp?
- Don't you pucker up to me, Eileen.
- Come on. Come on.
Eileen.
Uh, well.
How can I help you, madam?
I would like to close out my account.
Uh... Pardon me.
I... I don't believe I know you.
You... You have an account with us?
Oh, yes. I set it up six years ago, and I've been wiring deposits ever since.
Miss Anna Lee Zamora.
Please come in, Miss Zamora.
- Thank you.
- Just have a seat right over there.
Now then, uh...
...if you don't mind, could I just, uh, take a look at your bankbook?
Oh, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.
You see, we had a fire.
And it was terrible. I... I just...
Well, I really can't say.
Uh... I do recall signing something some time ago.
You must have my signature on file somewhere.
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
Let's go in here.
- We're with the Pinkerton Detective Ag...
- I can see that.
We're following a harlot name of Cody Zamora.
She killed a fella up in Colorado Territory.
- She's riding with a bunch of other whores.
- Yep. These are some bad girls.
This one rode in this morning with three others.
It's, uh, very unusual to carry an account like this.
And, uh, there's considerable funds in your account.
$12,432, I believe.
- Why, yes. A little more with the interest.
- How lovely.
- Cody!
- Hold on.
- Not now.
- You gotta listen to me. Excuse me.
- See here, young lady.
- This is my sister.
- Pinkertons!
- Lilly, get!
She belongs to you, does she?
It's all right, Jenkins.
- It's all right.
- Yes, sir.
I am so sorry.
Oh. My sister, she's a little...
Nita, those Pinkertons. They're here.
Come on.
Here you go.
Cody. Cody. The Pinkertons are comin'...
Wrong, darlin'. The Pinkertons are here.
Miss Zamora, if you'd come with me.
- Get her.
- Come on.
Get off of me!
Cody!
Get up.
Drop the gun.
Drop it.
You too.
Move it!
Inside!
- Move!
- Aw, hell.
That's far enough, fat man.
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.
Come on! Come on!
Get in there. Get in there.
You heard him.
Cody?
Well, kiss my sister's black cat's ass!
What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm making a withdrawal.
- So are we, darlin'.
How much you taking out?
Well, give the lady her money, fat man.
Move it!
Thanks, Kid.
For old times.
Boss.
We've got it all. Let's ride.
Come on.
Let's go.
Let's get out ofhere now!
- Ah. Hold. Hold.
- Eileen, get your behind on that horse.
What the hell you think
I'm trying to do?
You know where to find me, darlin'.
You son of a bitch!
- Shit!
- Eileen, come on!
Stop!
Cody!
Come here.
Come here, you tramp.
- Get your hands off me!
- You're up to somethin', you little tart.
- Damn it!
- Stand still!
You. William Tucker.
- I'm deputizing you.
- I gotta get on back to my place.
Well, I gotta form a posse and get after them stinkin' Jarretts.
Now you put that down and take her over and lock her up.
You think you can do that, Deputy?
- I heard you twice the first time.
- Well, then, goddamn it, do it!
And then get yourself fixed up.
Yeah, all right, boss.
All right.
Who's gonna volunteer for the posse?
Come on. We gotta get 'em before they cross the river.
- I'll go, Marshal.
- Damn stranger's the only one of you with guts?
It's your damn money they stole.
You just gonna stand there and take it?
All right. That's better.
Let's mount up.
You feel like a big man?
I feel like my damn shoulder hurts.
Why don't you sit down? Act like a lady.
Tucker, watch her.
I'm going to the damn doctor.
William.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come closer. Please.
- Do I look like a criminal?
- No, ma'am.
I ain't no bank robber.
I ain't no deputy.
Why don't you just let me go?
I'd like to. I really would.
But I can't.
I'm sorry.
Ma'am, you shouldn't oughta carry on like that.
Oh, God. For heaven's sake.
Now, you see, when the marshal gets back, he'll straighten everything out.
We ain't gonna follow 'em?
We ain't the law over there.
We go back.
Are we gonna get her out?
- Are we gonna get Eileen?
- How are we gonna do that?
I don't know, but we got you out when they were gonna lynch you.
Well, now, that was lucky.
Look, I don't let my friends get hung.
I want her out just as much as you.
They're not gonna hang her.
- So rest easy.
- Do nothin'?
- Shit.
- I'm goin' to Kid Jarrett.
- I figure he's our best chance.
- Kid Jarrett's our best chance?
That son of a bitch was nothing but trouble to you.
- That was a long time ago.
- Yeah, and this morning all he did was steal our money.
That's Kid's way of inviting me to come over and see him.
Hell of an invitation.
Look. You don't know him. He's bored.
He'll give us back our money and spring
Eileen from jail just for the hell of it.
You're rating yourself awful high, Cody.
I ran with that gang.
I know what I'm doin'.
- Where the hell you goin'?
- With you to Kid Jarrett's.
You don't go anywhere near Jarrett's.
Do you understand me?
I'm goin' with ya, Cody.
I'm warnin' you. You stay put.
You don't do what I tell you, you're both out.
Hey.
New Orleans. My daddy had a big house...
...in the Quarter.
That's the French Quarter.
Parlez français?
Excuse me?
It's French.
It's the language of love, you know.
Oh, I didn't know the language of love had words, ma'am.
Oh, my, yes.
I could teach you.
Huh?
French. I could teach you French.
Oh. Of course.
So you're a rancher.
I got a couple dozen head of longhorns.
- Cattle rancher.
- Yes, ma'am.
Nearby?
Why, yes. Actually, about 16 miles out on North Road.
- It's a beautiful piece ofland.
- Huh.
It's called the Circle Bar "T."
Circle Bar "T."
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's a nice name.
Rico!
You can no come here, señorita.
Cody Zamora.
Cody Zamora.
Bueno.
Déme su pistola.
¡Hola, señorita!
You here to keep the boys happy?
It's been a long time, Cody.
It's been a long time, Frank.
Yeah.
Kid said you were back in Texas.
Did he tell you he stole my money?
- He said you'd be comin',
- Damn right.
That money is our stake for a new start in the Oregon Territory.
Yours and whose, darlin'?
Me and some friends. One of us got a homesteader's claim.
Oregon.
- I ran that once.
- Now why didn't I see you at the bank?
I got what I need right here.
Mucha tequila.
Muchas bonitas.
Well, Kid's still hungry.
Yeah. Thinks he can make a bigger name for himself than his old man.
Always did want what I had...
...didn't he?
Well, look who's here.
We got us some talkin' to do, Kid.
Let's talk.
I'll see you around, Frank.
Playing with the big guns now, Kid?
- You know I always did like playing with things. - Mm-hmm.
You're taking trains too, I see.
Military shipment. Selling
U.S. Army guns to Juarez.
It's funny what you can find out when you're running pinoche...
...to the army colonels over at Fort Clark, right, Jack?
By Friday, I'll be up to my ass in Mexican gold.
I'll bet you will.
Vete.
Vete!
- So what's on your mind?
- You invited me.
- Well, didn't you want to come?
- For the old days.
Remember when we went riding with that bunch down to Tucson...
...running those guns into Durango?
- You remember that?
- We had us some times, didn't we?
You lying bitch.
You just come here for your money.
Oh, now, what's the difference, Kid?
You're gonna be up to your ass in Mexican gold by Friday, right?
That's right. What's 10,000 one way or the other?
$12,432. Why don't you just give it to me, and I'll be on my way.
Look, I was only playing with ya.
You can have your money.
Keep the change.
Thanks, Kid.
What makes you think Oregon is gonna be any different, hmm?
A new start for an old whore.
Why don't you just say it, Kid?
You're still sore at me for running out.
Sore? Now, why would
I be sore? Hmm?
Because you run out on me in the middle of the night without saying a word? Hmm?
I'll see you around.
She ain't coming back.
- She is so.
- I'm going to get Eileen. Are you with me or not?
- When Cody comes back and we're not here...
- Don't worry about it.
She'll wait.
Lilly.
Don't hurt me.
There's no chance of that.
Electric chair? If you ask me...
...it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper just to hang 'em.
- That way, you can use the rope over and over again.
- What's that?
- Huh?
There. That's that whore.
That ain't her. You're drunk.
- She's been beaten.
- Here.
- Can you help her?
- Here.
Her back.
Her back was beaten.
Aw, hell. Why we gotta walk all the way the hell down here for?
Because she's in one of these tents. I seen her.
You ain't seen her.
I say we go right across the street...
...and get our bell ropes pulled.
I thought we were off duty.
We ain't ever off duty.
Psst. Hey, fellas.
You those fellas after that whore from Echo City?
What's it to ya?
You seen her?
Well, now, it depends.
That poster talked about a reward?
Well, could be there's a real big reward.
- Could be I know where that whore is right now.
- Where'd that be?
Where'd that reward be?
$500 wired to you when we get her.
My word as a Peckerton Ditinctive.
$500 is more than I'm used to.
All right. I seen that whore Cody riding up river not an hour ago.
- Well, hell, why didn't you do something?
- She's with Kid Jarrett.
Are you sure it were Kid Jarrett?
Sure enough. I'd of done something too, but I ain't no Peckerton Ditinctive.
Hell, Cody Zamora and Kid Jarrett.
Powerful...
...gunpowder heal wound.
Okay. Okay.
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.
- Tucker.
- Yeah, what do you want, Earl?
Get out here, Tucker.
- What are you doing?
- Interrogating the prisoner.
Well, you ain't trained for that.
I'll take over.
I'm making some real good headway there, Earl.
Your ranch is waiting on you, boy.
I expect that can wait a good while longer.
Now, I been talking to her.
She ain't no bank robber.
In fact, she's a real fine lady from New Orleans.
Tucker, you go home now.
Um, I'm turning myself in.
- Say what?
- I was with the gang that robbed the bank.
Oh, I can't take it anymore.
Maybe you oughta sit down.
Eileen.
- It's about damn time.
- Here. Tie this on.
Y'all don't know how hard it is being hunted.
Men wanting you everywhere you go.
I just wanna be safe.
What are you doing standin' here?
Go and question the prisoner, son.
- William.
- Yes.
- How would you like to kiss me?
- Excuse me?
First, they hurt me right there.
- Mmm.
- And then...
- They hurt me right there.
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.
Ma'am, those may be severe injuries, but I don't see any marks.
Perhaps if you just move it up a little bit.
- Oh!
- Shit.
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
- I've got more injuries.
- Show me later.
Gettin' me out in the middle of something...
Here's your chance to be a big hero to someone in real trouble.
I swear, on my honor as a Southern lady.
Get out of my way.
Hang on.
I didn't have anything to do with that robbery. You're just gonna have to believe me.
- Move!
- Please, William.
- I don't know why
I believe you, but I do.
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on. Get out.
- And you know what? For your own good.
- Wait! Wait! Hang on now!
- You're just gonna have to wait in there.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you, William.
You tell 'em that we held a gun to your head.
- Eileen, come on.
- Let's go. You take care, William.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on. They was tryin' to make me eat beans.
Hold up. Hold up.
- It's Cody's horse.
- See if you can find her.
- We'll be at the Circle Bar "T." Sixteen miles...
- Okay.
- Up the road next to Turtle Creek.
- Got it.
Let's go.
Don't worry, mister. Wife be okay.
Thank you.
Well, Mr. McCoy.
You seem to be my lucky penny.
It weren't no accident I was in Echo City or that I tracked you here.
Word was you had a history with the Jarretts.
I told you I was a prospector.
That's all true.
I'm on my way to the Klondike.
I got a claim there.
It could be worth a fortune in gold...
...but first I've got an old score to settle with Frank Jarrett.
He jumped my father's claim, then he killed him...
...and my ma was done like-like you was.
She lived on a couple years.
I swore on her grave
I'd live to see Frank Jarrett die.
So you figured that Jarrett's whore might lead you back to him.
Yes, ma'am.
That was the truth of it.
I didn't get our money.
Circle Bar "T," all right.
- This is big.
- Ha! This ain't so big.
This used to all be free-range.
Law of the land was the cattle could go where they pleased.
You see that barbed wire?
That gave small ranchers like Tucker a chance to get started...
...without being overrun by the cattle from the big outfits.
You know, folks say the West was conquered by the railroad.
Uh-uh. My daddy says it was conquered by barbed wire.
Well, you sure know a lot about this for a fine Southern lady from New Orleans.
Ah, Lilly,
I ain't from New Orleans.
I'd like to have been.
I grew up on an east Texas grub ranch not much different from this one.
Well, I don't know much about grub ranches...
...but this sure looks nice to me, Eileen.
It's got possibilities.
Well, ain't this sweet?
Little boy's gonna rob an army choo-choo.
Gonna get hisself a big, new toy gun, huh?
That gun's gonna make me rich, old man.
Oh, hi, William.
I hope you don't mind.
I kind of helped myself to a few things.
I- I-I've made a really nice stew.
I wouldn't go in there if I was you.
Our friend's restin' in your bed.
Sure is nice of you to let us stay here, Mr. Tucker.
Most kind.
Now, wouldn't you like some stew?
- I've made some pies.
- Sure smells good.
Hi. Joshua McCoy.
You got a real nice spread here, William.
That's just great.
That's just great.
Why don't y'all just make yourselves at home?
I been alone out here goin' on a couple of years...
...since my family died.
I reckon you're the first company
I've had out here.
I guess I wouldn't be much of a man...
...if I wasn't at least hospitable.
Welcome to my home.
The population of the United States is over 63 million people now.
Well, they sure ain't here.
I better let you get some rest.
No, you can stay.
Well, I suppose
I don't wanna be alone.
That's funny?
Funnier than you know.
I suppose I'd like to stay.
May I have the pleasure of a dance?
Oh, I don't know.
Come on. You're not gonna turn me down, are you?
Well, I don't... I don't do a lot of dancin' out here.
I feel kind of silly.
You boys are making me very angry.
Now, let's not be shy, and do what I told you.
That's it.
You boys are gonna be famous.
Tell your grandchildren you got held up by Kid Jarrett.
- Here, I'll get it.
- Don't look so sad, boys.
You look good in your drawers.
You fools be careful with that thing!
That's precious cargo we've got there.
Shit! It's okay, boss.
Hyah! Giddap!
Now.
Up in the hills!
What are you doin', Jack?
Get this wagon out of here.
Okay, Boss.
Come on! Giddap!
- Where are you goin', Jack?
- Aah!
Roberto! Come back here and fight!
Yuma! Roberto!
You yellow dogs! Get back here!
Oh, damn!
Ned! Ned!
Ned, where you goin'?
Anita!
Get your yellow asses back here, you cowards!
Oh, God.
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.
You dumb ass! Ain't nothin' but Cody and a bunch of women!
Ha! Better go find your toy, sonny.
Where do you think you're goin'?
Put me down, you asshole!
Name of the man that's killin' ya is Joshua McCoy.
Don't mean spit to me, boy.
Josh, they got Lilly. Kid's got Lilly.
- Cody.
- Bring him along. We'll trade him for Lilly.
I'm sorry, boss.
What happened to Jack?
You won't be seeing him no more.
What about you, Ned?
Tried my best, boss. Almost got my ass shot off. Lost my damn hat too.
- Where's Frank?
- They got him and they got the guns...
...but we got this so we're gonna make a little trade.
I seen one of these once at the armory in Cheyenne.
God, it's heavy.
We trade Frank for Lilly.
When we get her...
...we give Kid this toy and get our money back.
- This is not a toy.
- Let's get to work.
I can't believe we're even thinking about doing this.
I can't stand to think of her there with those dirty, disgusting men.
Only reason she's there is we went running off after Kid in the first place.
Are you saying this is my fault?
All you care about is revenge on Kid.
You went with us, Anita.
You came along.
I never should've gone.
None of us ever should've gone.
None of this ever should've happened.
I shouldn't of let anything happen.
- We have no choice. We have to get Lilly.
- I know!
- Nita.
- Let her go.
Nita!
Nita! Nita!
Can I have some of that water, please?
Mighty thirsty.
Thank you.
Couldn't help but overhearing about that land.
In Oregon, ain't it?
Grand territory, Oregon.
Spent a couple of years there once.
Lot of rain. Lot oflaws.
Don't like either.
Why are you talking to me?
Cody told me about your plans.
Sounds sweet.
It's just that I've never heard of no single miss holding a claim for land...
...in Oregon, that is.
Well, just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean it can't happen.
Suppose not.
- Where is she off to?
- She's just riding off some steam.
She sure picked a good time to pitch a fit.
If it were her in trouble, Lilly'd be the first one to be there.
What's your name?
- Lilly.
- Just Lilly?
- Lilly's enough.
- Yeah, if you answer to it.
That depends on who's askin'.
You don't look much like a parlor house girl in those pants and boots.
What's your family name?
- Laronette.
- Laronette?
I knowed a Roy Laronette. Seen him in a Wild West show over in Del Rio.
- Best trick rider I ever seed.
- Is that a fact?
Well, how'd the daughter of a trick rider wind up working in a parlor house?
He died... And the show died with him.
It came up to me to pay off his debts.
Oh. Well, ain't you daddy's sweet little girl?
- Sit her down.
- Sit down!
We got a real hellcat here.
May take some time breakin'her in...
...but it's gonna be a lot of fun doin' it.
This claim of yours seems proper enough, young lady.
Why worry your little head?
Your husband seems to have these matters well in hand.
What if my husband is deceased?
Ma'am, I don't quite know how to tell you this, but...
Tell me what?
Well, your claim's worthless without your husband alive.
See for yourself. Uh, second paragraph.
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but it's the law.
- Surely you understand that.
- Yes, I understand that.
I was worthless until I married, so now I guess I'm worthless as a widow.
Funny. I had some value as a whore.
- Did I shock you?
- Well, no, ma'am, I...
You expect me to cry all over your big desk?
Well, to hell with that.
If your laws don't include me, well, then, they just don't apply to me either.
Ma'am, that'll still be six bits for my services.
Keep the change, you sawed-off fart.
Don't let him play with you.
Well, looky here.
My little whore finally found herself a pretty boy.
Keep talkin'. That's all you can do.
There was a time I did a hell of a lot more than talk to you.
You know where I found her?
She was scrubbin' floors in a parlor house.
Wasn't more than 14.
She weren't contrary like that back then.
No, sirree.
Got her real excited being with a bunch of bandits.
My God, how she'd open up to me.
How she carried on.
Then you. Look at you.
A lovesick pretty boy.
Now after all these years of wantin'to kill me...
She won't let ya.
Nothing's changed.
You're dead. I just ain't killed ya yet.
Hey, pretty boy! Come over here.
Come on over here.
I got somethin' to tell ya.
Yeah, you look just like your ma.
Real pretty.
Beautiful piece of a woman, your ma.
Evangaline. Am I right?
Josh!
What happened?
He tried to escape. I shot him.
Did you shoot him before or after you untied him?
I said...
...did you shoot him before or after you untied him?
He brought it on himself.
He was playing you, and you couldn't rein yourself in...
...and now we can't trade him for Lilly.
Get the hell out of my sight.
Keep ridin' till you hit the Klondike.
Nita!
Sweet pea, where have you been?
- The claim's no good.
- What?
I went to a lawyer's office in town. He said the claim's no good without Jim alive.
- Let's go get Lilly.
- Come on.
What are you lookin' at?
Pigs.
You know, you're gonna be around here a while, girl.
You better be a little more friendly-like and get to know everybody.
Over here is Rico.
This here is Ned.
Roberto.
This here's Yuma.
Me and Yuma go back a long ways.
- Isn't that right, partner?
- Long ways, Kid.
Go inside and get one of Cody's old dresses out of my trunk.
Right away.
Have a drink.
Drink!
The more I think about it, it might be nice having you around here.
Let those whores keep the old buzzard.
- Hey, boss.
- Not that one. The red one.
Get up.
Get up!
Take your clothes off.
Get in here.
- Damn it, boss!
- You keep your ass in there!
Least let us watch.
Put it on.
Ned. She's all yours.
Hello, girlie.
What do you say old Ned unties you, and we can have some fun, huh?
You better kill me first...
'cause the only way
I'd lay with you is if I was dead.
It's Josh.
- Look again.
- Lilly? Oh, Lilly.
- Lilly, I've been so worried about you.
- You should've seen it.
It was crazy. Bombs going off everywhere.
Josh came in, attacked Kid's place.
Got me out of there. I was riding out.
- I looked behind me, but he wasn't there.
- Where is he?
I think they got him.
Where's the old man?
Dead.
Well, that is a shame.
What are you gonna do now?
- Where's McCoy?
- Oh, him.
He's here, but I wouldn't worry about him.
He ain't dead... Yet.
- I'll buy him.
- You ain't got enough money to buy him from me, darlin'.
Well, now, you don't have a Gatling gun, do ya?
That is true. That is true.
- Just show me the gun.
- Show me McCoy.
Tráelo!
I've shown you mine.
You show me yours.
Can I offer you ladies a drink?
Go get it.
Kid!
- Now, hurry up.
- Yeah, boss!
Come on.
Open that up! Let's see what we got there.
Hey, Lilly, welcome back.
Yes. Yes.
You want him?
Take him.
Josh.
Josh.
Oh, that's real sweet... comin'from a heartless whore.
That's what you came for.
Now get your ass outta here.
Cody. Let's go.
Girlie.
You come back and see old Ned, you hear?
We'll finish what we got started.
Lilly.
Cover me!
Lilly!
Cody! Here! Be careful! Here!
Just foolin'.
You don't think I'd shoot you in the back, do you, darlin'?
I'm even out of bullets. I got no bullets.
Pick it up. Put it in. Die like a man.
You are a dumb whore.
Looks like you could use some help.
Yeah, I reckon I could.
You all set to go?
I guess.
I'd sure be mite pleased if you decided to stay on...
...share this place.
Oh. Well...
William...
I think there's something
I need to tell you.
I know all about that.
It's all in the past.
It don't matter to me none...
- So you don't have...
- I'm no lady from New Orleans.
My daddy was a poor rancher.
Nearly worked himself to death...
...till the bank came and took it all away.
I told myself...
I'd get away from that damn dirt pile...
...and marry me a rich gentleman.
I was so stupid.
All I ever got was a... couple of fancy dresses...
...and a broken heart.
I got this land. I ain't got no money.
But I swear...
I'll never break your heart.
- Oh! Geez! That's my arm.
- Sorry.
It's your share. You earned it.
Consider it a wedding present.
I got everything I need right here...
...but I'll take it.
Well, the rest of it's here...
...all except the $12,432, which belongs to us.
You should stay. When that money gets back to Agua Dulce...
I expect y'all are gonna be big heroes in these parts.
We ain't heroes.
Well, it's time to go.
There's a gold mine in the Klondike waitin' on some hard work.
That's a long way.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, sweet pea.
See you. Take good care of her.
She's two handfuls, but I'm gonna hang on.
Eileen.
- Hey, you'll see her again.
- It ain't likely.
Love you.
Let's ride.
Oh, Lilly, I love you all the way to the moon and back.
That's not gonna change.
She killed a fella up in Colorado Territory.
Sorry, son. The only female I seen in the last month is that mare over there...
...and she's starting to look pretty good to me, ain't she?
Yeah.
Hey, what's that you're drinkin' there?
- Tennessee sippin' whiskey.
- Come on.
Does your pecker work proper?
Whenever a sweet-smelling gal passes close by... does it stand up and say howdy?
Good.
And you do know where to put it?
See, you're just nervous, right? Hey.
My first time-- the only time in my entire life--
I was ever scared shitless.
Yeah, it was a nerve-jangling experience... for a boy of 11 years.
It's as simple as riding a horse.
Start with a walk.
Now move into a canter.
Steady-like.
Don't trot. Never trot.
Now you hold that steady canter... till that sweet little creature starts to moan.
That's your signal. Gallop.
Gallop. Ride hard.
Come on. Yes!
You got business here?
Now remember, never just jump on a woman.
First, tell her she's got a pretty dress... nice, soft hair--
In your case, stroke it a few times.
Then jump on her.
Lovemaking.
- Hi there,Jack.
- Boys.
Howdy.
- Kane!
- Howdy,Jack.
How are you, Mr. Kane?
Mr. Kane, welcome back.
- Thanks, Luke.
- What'll it be? The usual?
They told me you were badly wounded, maybe even dead.
Well, the fact is, I did stop enough lead to kill a normal man.
But you know me.
I'm as tough and hard as a nickel steak.
You surely are.
I want you to meet my new partner.
Ben Doyle.
Ben, this is the Miss Lana Castelle-- prettiest gal in the county... sweetest singing voice in the entire state.
Pleased to meet you.
- Would you like a--
- Ben's a man of few words.
But he was just saying to me on the way in... that he'd really like it if you could organize--
Pilar?
Pilar here's a perfect match for Ben.
He don't talk much, and she never stops.
Hi.
Now, Pilar, darling...
I want you to take good care of our friend Ben here.
He could surely use a nice, hot bath.
But aside from that, he's unsoiled.
Well, what a coincidence.
So am I.
What do you say you and me get acquainted over some bubbly champagne?
Come on.
Right. Now let's you and me get on with my pleasuring.
''Cowboy Jack.''
I'm gonna do my specialty number now--
''Cowboy Jack.''
He was just a lonely cowboy
With a heart so brave and true
-And he laid--
-Honey, if you're gonna sing like that--
With eyes of heaven's own blue
Your sweetheart waits for you, Jack
Your sweetheart waits for you
Out on the lonely prairie--
Darned if you ain't the quietest man I ever met.
You ain't said more than two or three words in almost an hour.
Mind you, I am not one to complain about such things.
Most men will just interrupt a person or talk right on over the top of you.
But not you, sweetie.
You are a rare gentleman, Ben.
Now, don't you want to say something sweet about me?
Then go right on ahead, darlin'.
You can't talk?
Is there any other part of you that doesn't work proper?
So you mean to say no matter what... different things we find ourselves getting up to... you couldn't tell nobody, could you?
Ever.
Now isn't that a real shame?
New York.
We'll go to New York City.
I reckon people there got culture comin' out of their ears.
When,Jack?
Well, one last job. I need a couple of weeks to get Ben ready.
I'm glad you got Ben to watch your back.
There's some things a woman can tell right off.
He's loyal to you.
That would be on account of I saved his life.
He got bit in the leg by a rattler.
If I hadn't been there to calm him down and suck out the poison... he was a goner.
Of course we never mention it.
Men.
Well, this time we really are gonna go off and make a fresh start.
I can feel it.
It seems like only yesterday
I promised to take you away--
It's been nine years... honey.
Give us a beer, Luke.
Someone's looking bright and perky this morning.
Let me guess. Excited about starting your schooling today, right?
Something else put that silly grin on your face?
Howdy, Ben.
What did you do last night?
Oh, no. You mean, you--
Well done.
I'd like to hear ''sorry'' from you, boy.
A stupid grin just don't get it done.
Don't look at him.
This is none of my affair, gentlemen.
Hey, Mick, you gotta watch this.
- That's Comanche Doyle.
- He don't look like no Indian.
He ain't.
They call him Comanche
'cause after he guns a man down... he cuts out his tongue.
Got a dozen of them on a string round his neck.
Under his shirt.
He likes to feel it next to his skin.
Yeah, I heard about him. Comanche--
Doyle.
Comanche Doyle.
Yep. Dangerous fellow.
I got 50 bucks says he can drop them both... without spilling his beer.
A hundred.
Now just hold on there.
No point in getting all het up over spilt beer.
I spill more just taking a drink.
I guess I'm just clumsy.
No offense, Mr. Doyle.
Lucky fellow.
I appreciate your not making trouble in my town...
Comanche.
You coming?
That's what you call bluff.
We scared the gizzards out of them boys.
I surely hope your friend wasn't running from me.
No, ma'am. He'd more than likely be running after a pretty filly like you.
You can be sure of that.
Last night, he practically begged me to marry him.
But I'm too young for that.
Ah, you got to love 'em.
No point in practicing that.
Too slow.
Got a better idea for you.
Take that rig off.
Rode with a fellow once, name of ''Bad Eyes'' McBain.
Now he really needed eyeglasses.
Couldn't see past his hand.
So--
Try that on.
Made himself a special piece.
Twenty-gauge cut down.
It's a close-up gun.
Got to get close.
Take it easy.
That knot in the wall.
.45 caliber.
.50 caliber special.
Lightning don't strike twice.
Once is enough.
Now, this shotgun, six or seven paces... blow a man clean out of his boots.
But at 30 paces... it will just make him real pissed off.
Put it away.
Now, no point pulling a gun on a man... if you look like a scared rabbit.
You gotta look right through him... like he's nothing.
Think like you're a rattlesnake... and he's just a little mouse.
Me? Is that how I do it?
I just know I'm good.
Real good.
That tale I was telling about you being Comanche Doyle-- it ain't entirely made up.
Of course it ain't true about Comanche cutting out a man's tongue.
Ben, I want you to have this.
In fact, this ain't even an Indian charm.
I got it off an old China man.
That's a fertility charm.
They ain't tongues.
They're testicles.
You know, balls.
From now on, they're tongues, Comanche.
Ah, no need to thank me.
Just get on with your gun practice.
I'll fix us up a bit of grub.
Heard talk he used to lay low around these parts.
Figured he'd head here if he was all shot up.
How shot up don't matter.
The reward stands... alive or dead.
No, I can't recollect anyone like that.
Hey, Lana, these two lawmen... are asking about an outlaw by the name of Lightning Jack Kane.
You know him?
Lawmen?
Lawmen are always fat, old, grouchy types.
If you two are lawmen, you can lock me up.
No, ma'am. We are the law.
Appointed special U.S. deputy marshals.
You know Kane?
Oh, I met him once.
That was enough.
He was no outlaw.
Outlaws can be gentlemen.
No, sir.
Mr. Lightning Jack Kane... was a mean, low-down conniving skunk.
I heard he's dead.
I hope he is.
You boys look parched.
Sally... why don't you find these two handsome boys a table... while I hustle up something wet?
You should be on a stage.
I can swear you meant that.
That part about Jack being a low-down, mean, conniving skunk, I meant it.
Lana, you be careful.
Them boys are toting badges.
I guess that makes them legal.
But they got a smell of death on them.
I know. I just want to know why the sudden interest in Jack.
Open up.
It's me. Lana.
I'm awake.
You told me you always slept buck naked.
Yeah, I do... but it wouldn't be decent in front of another man.
Is that what brought you here in the middle of the night-- started thinking about me buck naked?
I came here to warn you.
There's two deputy marshals in town... telling folks there's a dead-or-alive reward on you.
Dead-or-alive reward?
How much reward?
I think they said 200.
Well, maybe it was 2,000.
What's the difference?
It's dead or alive.
What's the difference? Women.
$200 is a fitting reward for a two-bit cattle rustler.
Darling, I'm Lightning Jack Kane... a bank robber and a cold-blooded killer.
Yeah, silly me.
I must have panicked.
Maybe they said 5,000.
5,000? Yeah, sounds more like it.
Saddle up.
Folks around here would turn in their kinfolk for less than that.
$5,000, eh?
I'm scared.
Ah, the law's been on my tail for years.
No, this is different.
These are bounty hunters.
And there's more coming.
Some marshal up north has been hiring killers-- special deputies.
Dan Kurtz,Junction City.
It's not safe for you here anymore,Jack.
You can't come back.
- See, we can't--
- No, no matter.
I ain't planning to come back-- not more than once... to take you with me, like I promised.
When?
One last big job.
I'll be back at the end of the month.
You be ready to run.
Got my word.
I don't suppose you picked up one of them wanted posters with my name on it.
This is just a small town.
We need a big city bank, like Junction City.
What, rob that bank again?
I could never go back there.
The whole town is deputized.
Lightning never--
Lightning never strikes twice.
You got a point.
That's the last place on earth anyone would expect me to turn up.
You're starting to think like an outlaw, kid.
Here it is-- the biggest cattle sale of the year.
Junction City auction yards.
Friday the 2 7th.
That's next Friday.
That bank will be fatter than the baker's wife.
And you and me are gonna take it.
Get us another beer, Ben.
I wanna do some more thinking.
Oh, sorry.
Get us another drink, Comanche.
Hey, boy.
Me and my friends were just wondering about that.
You planning on drawing down on a squirrel or a duck?
That man in the black coat-- that's John D. Coles.
Coles? The gunfighter from up north?
What's the matter, boy?
You think you can see a squirrel?
Gentlemen.
This is Mr. Comanche Doyle.
He's a bit-- So folks around here don't pay him no never mind.
You're doing a lot of flapping off at the mouth, mister.
Buying into this?
Or you gonna let that big mouth of yours just go on flapping?
You're right, sir.
This is none of my business.
My big mouth is shut tight.
I was about to leave.
Good idea.Just stick your tail between your legs... and slink out of here like a yellow dog.
Here. Try mine.
Git.
Now take on four guns, kid.
Now then, Mr. Comanche.
You got two choices.
Either you pull that squirrel gun of yours... or I pull it for you... and maybe stick it up your squirrel ass.
Yeah, four is hard.
But three?
Easy.
I'm so good, I scare myself.
You boys are lucky.
Now, if Comanche had drawn down on you--
Ben?
Hold it right there, Mister.
You blink an eye,
I'll cut you in half.
- Good night, Matthew.
- Good night, Sheriff.
Sheriff, it appears there was another drifter involved... but he skedaddled fast.
Nobody in town ever seen 'em before... but one of the boys said he heard the name Comanche Doyle.
That be you, Mr. Gunfighter?
Comanche?
Maybe a pistol-whipping would loosen up your tongue.
Leave it be, Bart.
It don't matter what he calls hisself.
I'll telegraph his description around tomorrow.
My guess is we'll know who he is by noon.
Anybody that fast with a gun has gotta be wanted for somethin'.
You know, men like you gotta understand... the old ways is finished.
You can't outrun the wire.
This is the 19th century.
Check around outside, Bart.
Make sure the boys have settled down for the night.
It's been a long time,Jack.
At least ten years, Tom.
How have you been?
Surviving.
Just surviving.
I can't let you just walk away.
Too many witnesses.
By tomorrow the whole county's gonna know about the shoot-out.
Shit.
Ten years ago, I'd have kicked this cell door down... and rode out of town with you, but now--
Just do your job, Tom.
We all gotta survive best way we can.
I don't take it personal.
I didn't put no name to the description.
It's the best I can do, partner.
Appreciate it.
All's quiet outside, Sheriff.
Well, you're deputized, Bart.
Just don't get close to the drifter.
I'll spell you about sunup.
Lock her up tight.
Evenin', Sheriff.
Who's there?
You boys can act the fool all you want.
I ain't opening up for nobody.
Go home and sleep it off.
Durned fools.
Well, looky here.
No aiming sights.
You sure got lucky in that ruckus.
No. You got lucky.
Lucky I didn't blow a hole in that turd you're using for a head.
On your feet, you son of a bitch.
Slowly, boy.
One hand out front, the other on your head.
Come closer.
Back up.
Now you can bunk down.
No point in me missing a good night's sleep... over scum like you.
Deputy!
Fire!
The keys!
Hurry up.
Come on.
The cuffs!
Fire!
Cuffs!
You got religion, Ben?
I never thought much on it myself... till when you came through the flames.
Thought you was old Satan himself come to claim me personal.
I've come to thinking, Ben, you've got a shortcoming.
You ain't partial to pulling the trigger and blowing a man's head off, right?
Hey, don't be ashamed, Ben.
Nobody's perfect.
Even I got one flaw in my nature.
Never could trust anyone... till now.
You're being gun-shy doesn't matter.
I shoot better than any two men alive anyway.
What counts is,
I trust you, partner.
Trust you like a brother.
And that touches me.
I feel like
I should give you a big hug.
So it's a lucky thing we don't do that kind of sissy stuff.
Three dollars.
Now four. Now five.
Five dollars now.
Six dollars. Now seven.
Eight. Eight dollars.
Cattle sale's finished at 3:00.
By 5:00, that bank will be bursting at the seams with cash.
Then we go in and pay our respects.
Yeah, I know.
That's what's gonna give us the element of surprise.
I'll show you.
Beg your pardon, sir.
That bank over there-- Is that where those outlaws were ambushed?
It surely is, sir.
You were right.
Outlaws.
It makes me nervous about depositing our cash there.
Gentlemen, you are looking at the safest bank in the state.
Every businessman in town is a member... and at the first hint of trouble--
No outlaw would even think about it... not after the way we handled that Younger gang.
You were part of that?
I was the first to spot 'em.
I guess I just have an eye for trouble, you know.
That's definitely the bank for us, then.
For sure.
Oh, no.
The good side is, he couldn't spot an outlaw if they took a dump in his hat.
The bad side is, he just proved it.
Two riders.
The one on the left, that's J.D. Kincaid.
Wanted for bank robbery in four states.
Maybe he didn't spot me.
His gang must be in town somewhere.
He wouldn't be dumb enough to try and take that bank with just two men.
That's different.
You'd better follow him, careful-like.
I'll meet you back at the stables.
At least six of them?
One of'em a guy with an eye patch?
Big fella?
That's Spencer.
That's the Kincaid gang.
They're here after the bank.
Should've known.
Biggest cattle sale of the year.
Town not expecting anything.
Outlaw thinking.
We got two choices.
We go in now, first, take the bank right now.
And it ain't worth taking till the sale's over.
Second choice--
We let Kincaid knock over the bank.
We jump him on the way out of town.
Which way out of town?
I hate these big cities.
What? Three.
Third choice.
We quit, find another bank.
What's wrong?
What is it?
Outlaws?
Bank!
I gotta alert the members.
Pete, you go get the marshal and I'll--
I'll sound the alarm.
Don't run.
We give up!
Hold it! Hold it!
- Hold it right there.
- Don't shoot!
All right, step forward.
Everybody step forward.
Put your weapons on the ground.
Lay them on the ground.
This way. Hurry.
Set it up there.
We're gonna get a shot of Marshal Kurtz capturing all the bank robbers.
All right.
Hold it.
-All right, you sidewinders, get movin'!
-Over to the jailhouse!
All right, we want to set up a shot right in front of the town hall.
I'll never forget their faces when they saw all those guns.
It'll be a cold day in hell... before any outlaw even thinks about robbin' this--
You're the committee of the Law and Order Association.
Stand perfectly still.
Wait for me at the horses.
There's one more thing I gotta do.
Just a little bit closer together.
If you folks will move off just a little bit. Thank you.
Gentlemen, please.
As still as possible.
This is for the big papers back east.
They want to see the original committee... and, of course, our next governor.
All right, gentlemen.
Hold it.
How long are these buzzards gonna stay in town?
As long as they're being paid.
They'll stay till they realize that Jack ain't never coming back.
Never?
But he promised Lana.
Oh, right. A man don't have to keep his word to a whore?
Someone should have told Lana that ten years ago.
Maybe.
But she ain't gonna hear it today.
Lana, why don't you come inside and share a lemonade with me.
I'm just getting a breath of fresh air away from them.
Jack's most likely waitin' till things get a bit quieter here.
Well, of course. He can't just ride up in broad daylight.
They'd spot him a mile away.
Honey, how many men have asked you to ride off with them... maybe even marry up with them?
More than I can count.
Well, start countin', darlin'... or one day you're gonna be standing on some dusty porch... waitin' for a knight in shining armor that's really just some gritty old cow--
What?
Shut up.
Shut up and drive.
Howdy, ma'am.
Kincaid gang. Huh!
Hey, Ben, relax.
Lana will be all right.
That's just a hick town.
No sheriff.
Besides, it's been two weeks.
No one's looking for us.
Yep, we did the perfect crime, kid.
And no one will ever know about it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you get everything, honey?
Any problems?
Maybe.
Ben, check my supplies. Make sure
I've packed 'em nice and tight.
Newspaper got a letter.
The letter says that you were the mastermind behind the robbery... that you double-crossed the Kincaid gang.
They even pointed out your photograph.
The letter was signed
''Comanche.''
Read out that part underneath my likeness.
Read it out loud.
''Ten-thousand dollar reward for Mr. Lightning Jack Kane... described by Marshal Kurtz as meaner than a rattlesnake... and twice as cunning.''
Oh, Ben.
Why?
Ten... thousand dollars... reward.
Meaner than a rattlesnake.
Twice as cunning!
Ten thousand dollars!
That's a Indian ritual.
Comanches.
We'd better get rollin'.
Every lawman in the territory's gonna be looking for me and Ben.
Maybe every lawman in the country.
Great.
Hey, Ben.
We're the Kane gang.
We're outlaws.
Jack, folks in town said this trail leads through hostile Apache country.
Good.
See this?
It's a spirit bag.
Bought it off an Apache medicine man.
That makes me a full blood brother to the Apache.
I'm practically family.
It was only $50.
- Well, what about me and Ben?
- No problem.
This covers my whole family.
I just tell 'em you're my wife... and Ben's our kid.
Anyway, relax.
There ain't an Indian within 100 miles of here.
I can tell.
They just moved out of the O.K. Corral down by Fly’s.
Looks like Ike and Billy Clanton...
... the McLaurys, Billy Claiborne.
Maybe more.
Let's go.
Morgan, take care of Mama for me.
Keep your little brother out of trouble.
Warren, I won't be seeing you for a while.
Where you headed, Wyatt?
Nowheres.
-I thought you went to Logan.
-I changed my mind.
Where you going, son?
To town. I’m going to enlist, Pa.
I wanna fight the Rebs with James and Virg.
-I’m ready.
-Are you?
You think your ma's ready?
I don't think she is.
Why'd you wait till I left to take off, Wyatt, if you think it's the right thing?
Virgil and James should be coming on home any day soon now. they do, you know your job.
-What was that? I didn't hear you.
-Eighty acres of corn.
You take on a job, you finish it.
Any man who can't be depended on steady isn't worth the trouble of having around.
What makes you think they're coming home soon, Pa?
This war can't last forever.
Besides, it's what I want to happen.
You know I gotta whup you a bit.
Come on, Johnny Reb.
Virgil?
Virgil!
Look who got long and tall.
We didn't know you was coming.
Why didn't you send word?
We didn't know ourselves, so then we thought we'd just come on.
Well, is James coming too?
James is right here with me, Wyatt.
Hey, Wyatt.
Don't shoot me now, you hear?
James.
-James, welcome home.
-Give us a hand here.
Oh, thank you, Lord.
Your mother thinks there's something wrong with me.
She says there's something in my blood that won't allow me to stay put.
Well, she may be right.
If she's lucky,
I haven't passed it on to you.
We'll see.
But for this family, the time has come to move on again.
To the west of here is a vast expanse of untamed territory...
...full of wild Indians and countless dangers.
But beyond that wilderness lies a land with great promise...
...where civilization has flourished for hundreds of years.
We'll go to California.
-And see what we can make of that place.
-But why, Pa?
There are opportunities for lawyers...
... and rich land available for people who know how to work.
In California, Wyatt will study the law and perhaps come to work with me.
Maybe Morgan and Warren will join our firm.
I’ve already told Pa that I’m not going.
I wanna see what's available to me here.
-I don't wanna go, either.
-Martha's in love with Jimmy Jorgenson.
Good for you, Martha. He's a standup boy.
His family knows what it means to put down roots.
Martha, if you don't wanna go, that's your decision.
Well, James has said he will join us, which suits me fine.
The closer you keep your family, the better.
They're the only ones you can rely on.
Remember this, all of you.
Nothing counts so much as blood.
The rest are just strangers.
Nicholas, I think you've already told them that.
A hundred times.
-Well, you can't hear it enough.
-I heard it a thousand times.
I heard you, Pa. Blood counts the most.
I want you to get these things and get back.
Don't talk to anyone you don't have business with.
-Don't worry. I’ll keep an eye on him.
-That doesn't comfort me, Tom Chapman.
Both of you use your heads.
-Don't linger.
-Don't worry, Ma. We won't shame you.
Giddap.
See you guys later. Nice pitchfork.
I like this town, Wyatt.
Why don't you give up?
Excuse me.
I’m not going in there.
I’ll take a look though.
Go ahead!
Walk away. It ain't worth the trouble.
Stand back, or I’ll settle this right now.
How you doing, Wyatt?
I’m okay, Pa.
You know this land is full of people doing wicked things to each other.
I ain't afraid. I like it out here.
I like how nothing much has been touched.
I gotta tell you something, Wyatt.
I told your brothers when they went off to fight. I suppose the time's come for you.
You know I’m a man that believes in the law.
After your family, it's about the only thing you got to believe in.
But there are plenty of men who don't care about the law.
Men who'll take part in all kinds of viciousness and don't care who gets hurt.
In fact, the more that get hurt, the better.
When you find yourself in a fight with such viciousness...
... hit first if you can.
And when you do hit...
... hit to kill.
You'll know. Don't worry.
You'll know when it comes to that.
The Earps always know.
Damn it, Wyatt, move this wagon!
They're catching up!
-This is all we got, Dutch!
-Well, whip those nags!
Giddap! Giddap!
Hold on, Dutch!
They're on us!
-Shoot the horse.
-What?
Shoot the lead horse!
You can hit a horse, can't you?
Come on, boys.
That horse never done nothing to me.
You should be riding shotgun.
I’ve seen you shoot.
Of course, I can't handle a team like you.
Hell, we made it. That's the thing.
You ever shoot a man, Dutch?
Sure, I shot a few.
How do you think I got this job?
How about yourself?
No.
Hope I never do either.
Good luck.
Here, girl.
It’s the sore-ass boys back for a Fourth of July.
-Hey, Red.
-I hope you brought sugar in this load.
I ain't had no real sugar for a month.
What's happening in this hellhole, Red?
You got any new ladies up to my standards?
I believe there is a new one just right for you.
She can stay awake two minutes at a time, and she favors them teeny little wangers.
Look who's talking.
Prize fight Sunday morning, Wyatt.
You gonna referee?
I don't know. Last time some of the boys didn't like the decision.
Sore losers. Hell with them. See you later.
Fight.
-Get him, Shanssey!
-Keep your guard up, Shanssey.
That's it. Take him down!
Hands! Keep your hands off!
One. Two. Three.
-You're hurt, Mr. Shanssey.
-No, I’m just getting started.
-It’s not worth it.
-Let me fight him.
-Are you sure?
-Aye.
Fight.
Enough. Enough.
It’s over.
God bless you, boy.
God bless you.
Hey. Hey, kid.
You don't know a boxing ring from a mule's asshole.
And you twice cost me money.
Sorry you didn't like the decision.
-Hey.
-Stay out. It’s not your fight.
Come on, Wyatt.
-This is the damnedest game I ever saw.
-You can't get a spot now anyway.
So why don't you come on up with me for a while?
I don't know if that's the right thing to do, Sally.
See, I promised my heart to another.
Which girl? I’ll fight her for you.
It’s no one here.
She's back in Lamar, Missouri, where my grandparents live.
Missouri? Wyatt, she ain't gonna help you tonight.
I saw her three times back in '63.
The third time she smiled at me just right.
Wyatt.
I guarantee you, she don't know what I know.
I’ll bet you're right about that, unless things have changed in Lamar.
Hey, Wyatt.
Your boy, Dutch, is drunk and he's telling everybody how you're gonna take Ed Ross.
Damn.
Who's Ed Ross?
He's the guy who decked you at the fight this morning.
Look, I’d get a hold of Dutch before he starts some real trouble for you, all right?
-Thanks, Red.
-Sure.
I know Ed Ross. He's bad business.
I’d better find Dutch.
-Gentlemen, that's it for me.
-You don't have to leave yet.
-You done?
-All yours.
-How do you play this game?
-Simple, friend.
Place your bet on a number to win.
If you're betting for it to lose, tap her with a penny on top.
All bets on the spread, comes the turn.
The loser, jack.
The winner is ace.
-I had a feeling this was a game for me.
-You're a winner, sir.
Now can we have a better time than this upstairs?
At least upstairs
I’d be making some money.
Wyatt Earp!
That's my name.
Well, that don't mean shit to me or anybody else in this world.
And it never will after this night.
-Ed, this boy ain't worth your trouble.
-Shut up, Sally.
Earp.
I hear you was looking for me to make a fight.
So I thought I’d be easy to find.
You heard wrong, mister.
Only thing that's happened between us is I got popped good.
-I don't wanna make a fight.
-Stop talking.
Okay.
This man wanted to shoot me down...
... over nothing!
He lost.
I’m taking his gun.
Boom.
-Yes?
-Hello, Mrs. Sutherland.
-I don't expect you'll remember me--
-I know perfectly well who you are.
Your grandmother said you were coming back to Lamar.
Yes, ma’am. I’m reading the law with Judge Earp.
Are those flowers for me?
Well, if you'd like them, then, yes, they are.
No, thanks. Let me see if Urilla is around.
She might take them.
Hello, Wyatt.
Hello, Urilla.
I brought you these.
Thank you.
I was glad to hear you were coming back to town.
-You were?
-Yes, I was.
What's wrong?
Wrong?
Nothing. It’s....
What is it, Wyatt?
Well, I wasn't prepared for how beautiful you are.
Did you learn to talk that way out west?
So you've come to Lamar to study with your grandfather?
Yes.
And to marry you.
-Do you think it's as simple as that?
-No.
I know it will take a great effort to win you.
I know many men have tried.
They failed because you were meant for me.
But I’ll succeed.
I’ll begin today.
Is that your hat?
When do you expect to begin your practice, Wyatt?
It may be a while yet, sir.
The judge says he's never seen anybody make slower progress.
That's because the law is so damn boring.
Erwin, not everyone has the aptitude to be a blacksmith.
Oh, I don't know.
I think I could teach Wyatt here a thing or two...
-... if he was willing to work at it.
-I appreciate that, but I found a job.
I thought I ought to make a living while I continue my studies.
What is it, Wyatt? What's the job?
With the city police.
I’m to be a constable.
I figure a man who's about to propose marriage better have a livelihood.
When do you expect this proposal to happen, Wyatt...
... so we can all join in the crying?
Daddy, Wyatt's proposed to me every day since he's been back in town.
--be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?
I do.
May we have the ring, please?
Place the ring on the ring finger of her left hand...
... and repeat after me.
-Urilla.
-Urilla.
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring, I thee wed.
By the virtue of the authority vested in me as a judge of the State of Missouri Court...
... I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Urilla, if it doesn't work out, you know where to find me.
Wyatt, you give it your best shot.
You can do it.
Make us proud, Wyatt.
You've never seen such open space, Urilla.
You can ride all day towards some mountain...
... and never even get close.
There's practically nobody there.
The few people that are...
...they just make up whatever kind of life they want.
What if you don't ever go back?
That's all right. I seen it.
I don't wanna be the reason that you're not happy, Wyatt.
I could be happy anywhere with you,
Urilla.
I don't care what job I have or where I live.
What I care about is being with you.
I thought this was only supposed to happen in the morning.
Please, Wyatt, let's not talk about it.
Urilla....
Can't you let me be?
You can't go in.
-I wanna see my girl.
-I can't allow it.
Has something gone wrong with the pregnancy?
This has nothing to do with that.
It’s typhoid.
I’m going to have to quarantine the house.
I can't let you go in, Esther.
It wouldn't be fair to the town.
Wyatt....
--our blessed Savior, who is himself the resurrection and the life...
... has assured us that this body, which we now commit to the ground...
... dust to dust and ashes to ashes, shall be raised in a perfect form...
... and united to the spirit which has gone to God.
The grace of Jesus Christ...
... and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost....
Come on.
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
What the hell?
Come on. Back off.
This ain't no hotel, you stinking bum.
I can't tell you from the horse crap.
Keep walking.
Pardon me, sir.
I wonder if you could spare a fellow the price of a meal.
You're drunk.
-No, sir, not at present.
-You reek of it and worse.
I’m not in the business of helping drunks.
You're correct, mister.
I have done my share of drinking lately, and I intend to correct my behavior.
And it would be a good....
It would be a good start if you could lend me the price of a meal.
There's no excuse for drunkenness.
Or for the self-pity which so often occasions it.
Yes, sir.
If you really want a meal, come with me, and I’ll arrange it.
But I won't give you money.
Thank you, sir. I accept.
I don't know if they'll serve you here.
Maybe they'll give you a meal in the back.
Wait!
You don't know what you're talking about!
-You want a snort?
-No.
-Bob?
-Coming.
-Here. You can have the hat, too!
-Son of a bitch!
That's a little better.
Leastwise, I can take you in my bed without you fouling it.
I’m sure you have your standards.
Don't think I don't.
-Pretty new at this, ain't you?
-What?
Making a wreck of yourself.
Won't last much longer.
Gonna reform, are you, ace?
Reckon I’ll get myself shot dead pretty soon.
Let's find out what's left of you.
All right.
Wyatt....
Pa?
Horse thief.
-How did you find--?
-Shut up! Do you wanna die?
That's what they do to horse thieves.
They hang them.
I don't care....
Do you think you're the first man to lose someone?
That's what life is all about, loss.
But we don't use it as an excuse to destroy ourselves.
We go on. All of us.
Even you, Wyatt.
You're getting out of here.
I gave them $500 bail.
And I told them I’d defend you at your trial.
There's not gonna be any trial.
Because if they try you, they'll hang you.
And if they catch you, they'll hang you.
So you get on that horse, Wyatt, and you ride.
You keep riding till you get out of Arkansas.
And you don't come back here, ever.
Get them two, right there.
Ed.
This could be the one.
I got it. I got it.
-How about some hot coffee?
-We serve warm whiskey, not hot coffee.
Why don't you find me some coffee?
Coffee she is.
Excuse me, mister.
We saw you come in with your wagon, but we didn't see any skinners with you.
That's because there wasn't any.
Quit?
Dead.
That's as good as quit in my book.
My brother and me are looking for work as skinners.
Bartender!
My luck finally turned with those big stinking bastards.
Whiskey all around!
-No, thanks.
-Wait a second, mister.
Link Borland's buying, so drink up.
Thanks, but I got some coffee coming.
I don't do well on whiskey.
If you'd pay for my coffee,
I’d be much obliged.
Drink!
Mister, I’ve been in a real bad mood for a couple of years...
... so why don't you leave me alone?
Drop your gun belt...
... and go away.
Got any experience?
A little.
It ain't too hard shooting a bunch of dumb animals.
Skinning's the ugly part.
Our mother didn't raise no shirkers.
-Twenty-five dollars apiece.
-Mister, that's a deal.
My name is Ed Masterson.
-This is my brother--
-Bat.
-What?
-Bat. Bat Masterson.
Bat?
Okay, Bat.
Wyatt Earp.
We got a brother named Jim too.
One brother?
That's all you boys got?
One measly brother?
Well.... Better than nothing, I guess.
There's nothing counts so much as blood.
Everybody else is just strangers.
Well, I guess we know where we stand with old Wyatt here, don't we, Ed?
You boys keep up that good skinning, you just might get to be family yet.
Of course, before you can be family...
... I’d have to know where you got that name, Bat.
It’s just my name.
I already told you 1 0 times, Wyatt.
They always called me that.
Shut up, Ed.
I tell you what, Ed. Tell me his real name,
I’ll let you do some shooting tomorrow.
It’s Bartholomew. Bartholomew Masterson.
Bartholomew?
Why, Bat, that's a beautiful name.
There's no reason to be ashamed of a $25 handle like that.
Maybe I’ll just call you that all the time.
Bartholomew.
Sure you won't change your mind and take another run at them?
No, I’m gonna visit my brother James over in Wichita.
Meet his wife.
See if I can’t figure out a better way to make a living--
Than shooting a bunch of dumb animals.
Don't hold much future, that's for sure.
Not with every asshole in the territory plugging away dawn till dusk.
That's us, ain't it?
Are all bets in?
Next card, loser is six, winner is eight.
-Just in time, sir.
-Thank you.
That's good, Wyatt.
Gentlemen, hold your bets for the new dealer.
James.
-How's it going?
-I’m getting the hang of it.
I like that game. I wouldn’t mind owning a place, I’ll tell you that.
Last week you wanted to start a stage line.
Or was that the silver mine?
Now we're gonna have our own saloon.
All I know is there's not much future in working for other people.
Who knows, Wyatt?
With what Bessie makes, maybe we could get a bit together.
Hi there.
She's my wife, Wyatt.
You know I don't like counting on women.
Hell, I’d count on Bessie ahead of any man I know.
What you got against her, anyhow?
-Well, she's a whore, James.
-Yes, she is, Wyatt.
And a hard-working one at that.
What are you doing with her?
Same thing everyone else is doing with her.
Only difference is she doesn't charge me.
It doesn't bother you?
That she doesn't charge me?
No, I’m rather fond of the arrangement.
On a good day, I can even get her to cook and clean a little.
-What was that? I didn’t hear you.
-Nothing.
Your arrangement doesn't bother you,
I guess it doesn't bother me.
That's a big load off my mind, Wyatt.
I’ve been losing sleep worrying about...
...whether or not my arrangement bothered you.
I got something for you!
-Where are you, big man?
-Look out!
What in tarnation?
What the hell's going on here?
Rowdy Dubbs is in the Iron Spike, drunk and mad.
He's already shot one man.
Ford here's gotta go in and get him.
Oh, no.
It’s your job, isn't it?
Not anymore.
They don't pay me enough to commit suicide.
Give me it.
I see you out there!
My leg!
Oh, shut up.
I don't see anybody else in there, but maybe you'd better check around.
-Young man, how'd you like a job?
-I got a job over at Pryor's dealing faro.
Seventy-five dollars a month.
-I don't know. Being a deputy isn't--
-I’ll make it 1 00...
-... but don't hold me up for more.
-A hundred dollars?
What's the marshal gonna say?
Marshal Meagher's gonna like you just fine, deputy.
This could be trouble.
Hold on, Mike. Don't shoot him.
-How are you, Wyatt?
-This is my no-good brother, Morgan.
As opposed to your no-good brother, James.
-That's right.
-Morgan, meet Marshal Meagher.
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.
Now, take off those guns.
-Do what?
-Take off your guns.
Take them off.
-When'd you get to town?
-About an hour ago.
-This boy would make one hell of a deputy.
-Might have an opening some time.
If we do, he can put them back on.
-It’s really good to see you, Morgan.
-You, too, Wyatt.
Come on. I wanna show you something.
-Go ahead.
-Come on!
You're not gonna believe this, Wyatt.
Hold on to your hat.
Or maybe just take it off.
You decent, hon?
Here he is.
Lou, this is him.
This is my big brother.
-How do you do, ma’am?
-It’s a pleasure to meet you, James.
This is Wyatt, not James.
We'll find James later.
Lou and I met out in California when I was out to see the folks.
Isn't she the sweetest thing you ever seen?
I believe she is.
Ma’am.
Wyatt Earp!
Don't shoot.
If you miss me, it'd destroy your reputation.
Mister, I ain't in the mood.
Larry Deger from Dodge City.
People tell me you the man
I’m looking for.
We used to see 30, 000 head of cattle come through in a season.
Hell, this year looks closer to 300, 000.
Think about it.
-How much?
-Seventy-five a month.
-I’m making more than that here.
-Plus $2. 50 for every arrest.
I need help and lots of it.
Things are already out of hand.
-So you're looking for more than one?
-Hell, yes.
You know anyone you can trust?
I might know a few.
I’m Wyatt Earp.
Who?
Wyatt Earp!
Who the fuck is Wyatt Earp?
It appears to be just some asshole.
He's the asshole who enforces the law.
-There ain't no law in Dodge City.
-That's right.
Not for the Clements crew.
Stand down.
We got some new laws since you boys were here.
Tell them, Morgan.
All visitors will check their guns immediately upon arrival.
That'll be the day.
No discharge of firearms within the city limits...
... except on the Fourth of July and Christmas Day.
No riding into the stores...
... saloons, the dance halls, or the gambling houses.
And no public intoxication.
Mannen, what's that supposed to mean, public intoxication?
I think what it means is we done enough talking.
Nope.
It means if you do anything we don't much approve of...
...we got a legal right to shoot you down.
You the one that's gonna try it?
Mr. Clements, your men respect you.
And I don't wanna do anything to take away from that.
I’m sure you've earned it.
You and your boys are welcome in Dodge City...
... as long as you obey the law.
But if you don't wanna cooperate...
... I’ll open you up right now with this shotgun so wide...
... your whole crew's gonna see what you had for breakfast.
After that it won't matter much what happens next, will it?
Give up your guns, boys.
Only ones you need now are sitting right between your legs.
-The job don't pay a salary to start.
-No salary?
Pays $2. 50 for every arrest.
Wyatt cleared, what, $1000 last month?
-Hell, how many is that?
-A lot.
You've got yourself a bit of a reputation, Wyatt.
It’s a tricky thing, the reputation business, Bat.
I gotta tell you, not all a man hears is good.
We heard about you all the way over in Abilene.
What're they saying?
That people in Dodge are complaining you're too quick to bash a man...
...just because you don't like the way he looks.
You just tell me what son of a bitch is complaining, and I’ll go bash him.
Look, there are plenty of people around here who like Wyatt.
Let's see, there's me, there's Virgil...
...there's me....
You might as well get broke in sometime.
Why don't you boys handle this one?
-Evening.
-I understand, let me tell you--
Evening!
Looks like you boys have been doing some drinking.
-Yeah? What makes you say that?
-Intuition, I guess.
We're glad you're having a good time...
... but you know there is a city ordinance against wearing firearms in town.
-Says who?
-Says the law, that's who.
Bat, you're being about as sociable as an ulcerated molar.
These boys, they don't--
Shit, Wyatt!
You talk too much, Ed.
You didn't have to do that, Wyatt.
Holy.... I’ll be a son of a bitch.
How--?
That fella could've gone for his gun after he saw you buffalo his friend.
Maybe.
He was so drunk he couldn't have hit the ground with his hat in three tries.
I’m just saying, I believe I could've talked those guns off him, Wyatt.
Ed, if I were you, I’d look for another line of work.
Politics, maybe.
Ed's got a different style is all,
Wyatt. People like it.
You could get killed in this line of work, Ed.
You could get people around you killed.
-Wyatt, we're just getting started.
-I know.
When I hit that fella, Bat, your first instinct...
...was to pull your weapon and cover me.
This is a harsh land, Ed.
It doesn't suffer fools.
I’m not a fool, Wyatt.
No, you're not.
But you're not a deliberate man, Ed.
I don't sense that about you.
You're too affable.
Don't do that, Wyatt. Please.
-You know how I feel.
-I want to, Mattie.
I could make you happy, Wyatt.
I know I could.
You just give me a chance.
I could be a wife to you.
I care for you, but I’m not gonna tell you things that aren't true.
I don't wanna hurt you, Mattie, but if seeing me causes you pain--
No. No.
We have time.
I have to give you time, that's all.
You'll see.
Only, don't leave money on my dresser, please.
Unless....
Unless it's because you wanna take care of me.
Is that how you mean it, Wyatt?
Bat. Ed.
Wyatt, the mayor's asked us to come get you.
The mayor? Is something going on?
Some people are concerned about the way you've been handling things, Wyatt.
What do you think, Ed?
There's been some complaints.
From some in jail, maybe, not from citizens.
Some of them too.
I’m just saying this out of friendship,
Wyatt, so you know.
All I know is the mayor wants to see you.
He asked us to find you.
That's what we did.
You know, Donovan went all the way to a title shot after that bout.
Don't know what shape I’d be in today if you hadn't have stopped that fight.
Drink?
What are you doing in these parts, Wyatt?
I thought you was the deputy marshal in Dodge.
I was...
...till the city fathers forgot to renew my contract.
Too much of a hard-ass, I guess.
Well, you are, Wyatt.
Everybody knows that.
-Who replaced you?
-A fella named Masterson.
-Bat Masterson?
-No.
It was his brother Ed.
What's he like?
He's affable.
Very affable.
What are you up to?
I’m doing a job for the railroad. Looking for a fellow named Dave Rudabaugh.
-Know him?
-Yeah.
I heard he might be headed this way.
Well, he come through here all right, but where he went I couldn't tell you.
What'd he do?
He robbed the Santa Fe train three times, looks like.
There is somebody who might know something.
If he does, he'll probably tell you.
He hates Rudabaugh.
-His name's Doc Holliday.
-He's a killer, isn't he?
He's killed some.
He owes me a couple of favors, and he's as good as his word.
He's dying of tuberculosis.
He travels with a whore named Big Nose Kate...
... but he's not her pimp.
You take me to him?
-Doc.
-John.
I’d like you to meet a friend of mine,
Wyatt Earp.
Wyatt Earp.
I’ve heard that name somewhere.
Don't know where, but it wasn't good.
Mind if we sit down?
I’m looking for Dave Rudabaugh.
There's a reward for information about him.
Are you a lawman, Wyatt Earp?
You are not wearing a badge.
Are you ashamed of your profession?
I myself was a dentist.
I was proud to be a dentist.
I did not hide the fact that I was a dentist.
How are your teeth, Wyatt Earp?
They're working all right.
Well, take good care of them.
They cannot be replaced.
I am no longer a dentist.
I’m a sporting man. That is my work now.
In Georgia, we were taught that a man should take pride in his work.
Have you ever been to Georgia, Wyatt Earp?
Beautiful state, Georgia.
Very green.
I was forced to leave Georgia.
I fear that I will never see it again.
I’m sorry.
Do you believe in friendship, Wyatt Earp?
So do I.
Do you have many friends?
John here has been a friend to me when most men were not.
Dave Rudabaugh is an ignorant scoundrel.
I disapprove of his very existence.
I considered ending it myself on several occasions...
... but self-control got the better of me.
Besides, I’m a sporting man...
... not a killer.
So...
...tell me about the reward, Wyatt Earp.
You'd be doing me a favor if you would call me either Wyatt or Earp.
Not both.
All right.
Wyatt.
Call me Doc.
Hey, bartender.
Howdy, friend.
You ain't my friend.
True enough, but I am the law here...
... and the law says that you can't wear the gun in town. Hand it over.
What if I don't?
I’ll have to take it away from you.
You'll go to jail. You'll miss the party.
You don't want that, now, do you?
Give it to me!
Don't give it back till they leave town.
Thank you.
-I sure will do that.
-Okay, good. You have a good night.
-That one laying over there....
-I didn't see who it was.
Bat....
Bat, I’m shot.
Ed!
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Let's go.
My name is Wyatt Earp.
It all ends now!
-Hello, Doc.
-Wyatt...
... I’d like you to meet a friend of mine,
Kate Elder.
-Nice to meet you, Miss Elder.
-Charmed, I’m sure.
You can call me Big Nose Kate.
Everybody else does.
No, it's not that big.
All kinds of reasons a person gets a name.
I couldn't agree more, ma’am.
This is my brother Virgil, Bat Masterson.
Doc Holliday.
Bat Masterson. You're the man that killed Sergeant King in Sweetwater.
Got you in the leg, I understand.
My congratulations to you, sir.
King was a skunk of the first order.
I wish you'd got him before he shot poor Molly Brennan.
-She was a sweet girl.
-Yes, she was, ma’am.
-So, what brings you to Dodge City, Doc?
-I guess I missed you, Wyatt.
This is where the money is.
Anything else?
Well, perhaps you've heard, we had an unfortunate incident in Fort Griffin...
... entirely beyond our control.
It seemed a good time to move on.
Hope we won't have anything unfortunate happen in Dodge.
Oh, likewise, I’m sure.
I’ll be checking my gun as soon as we find a suitable hotel.
I look forward to more civilized surroundings.
Gentlemen.
Wyatt...
... maybe he ought to check his knife too.
I heard he cut that man in Texas from his belly to his dick.
Bob.
Don't know what you want, Wyatt.
This setup seems pretty sweet to me.
We're making good money. Looks like we'll get a piece of the Alhambra Faro Bank.
There's never been a man that got rich working on a salary, that much I’ve learned.
If you wanted to get rich, you went into the wrong line of work.
That's what I’m saying.
Think it's gonna be any different in Tombstone?
Can't say, but there's silver there.
And opportunity.
The town's booming, Virgil.
They're gonna need saloons, stage lines, hotels, you name it.
Wyatt...
... did it ever occur to you that maybe we're doing the only thing we're any good at?
-Goodbye, Allie.
-Bye.
I’ll see you a little later.
-What's this all about?
-I don't know.
-Where you going?
-Allie says they wanna talk to you alone.
-Wyatt.
-Allie.
Wyatt.
Thanks for coming, Wyatt.
You're probably wondering what this is about.
You're damn right.
We've been talking.
We like it here in Dodge.
We want you to stop talking to our husbands about going to Tombstone.
All that nonsense about mining claims and starting your own businesses.
They all listen to you, Wyatt.
They'll do what you say.
I know Morgan will.
We'd like you to just leave well enough alone.
Just for once, let the Earps settle down somewhere.
Is that right?
You brought me here to tell me that without my brothers?
-Stop talking and start shooting.
-They're upstairs.
-It’s that goddamn Holliday and his whore!
-Where is it? Where'd you put it?
Never again, you bastard! You've raised your hand to me for the last time!
Kate! It’s Wyatt!
I’m coming in!
Don't shoot me!
Where'd you hide it?
Come on, little dove.
Let's finally get it over with.
Don't think I won't, you skinny heap of pus.
I won't have you hit me ever again.
Put that gun down, Kate.
I don't want you shooting me by mistake.
Year after year, sleeping in his bed...
... breathing the diseased air he coughs up all night!
No one else would come near him!
This is what I get!
This is his idea of a fair hand!
-You won't be shooting him tonight, Kate.
-Let her do it.
They can hang the bitch.
We'll both be happy.
-What's wrong with you?
-What's wrong with me?
What have you got?
I am dying of tuberculosis.
Everyone who knows me hates me.
I sleep with the nastiest whore in Kansas...
... and every morning I wake up surprised.
Surprised I have to spend another day in this piss-hole world.
Not everybody that knows you hates you.
What were you fighting about this time?
I don't recall.
But like most times, when Kate and l disagree, we set to killing each other.
All of you can kiss my rebel dick.
I know sometimes it isn't easy being my friend...
... but I’ll be there when you need me.
They say it was the biggest funeral in the history of Dodge.
Of course, the town ain't that old.
People liked Ed.
We've covered some ground, haven't we?
What is it, Wyatt?
I’ve had it with being a lawman, Bat.
Had enough of being famous.
I’m sick of Dodge.
What are you two doing?
Can't you wait to get in here?
We're saying goodbye.
I’m leaving Dodge, Doc.
-Hallelujah. I’ll drink to that.
-I’m gonna settle down...
... start some kind of business where nobody wants to shoot me anymore.
My brothers and I are going.
You're both welcome to come along.
-Where is that?
-Tombstone, Arizona.
Tombstone.
It does sound quiet, I’ll give you that.
The man we've been waiting for.
-Come on in.
-Here you go.
-Set it right down on that bench, son.
-Okay.
Our savior has arrived.
Oh, yeah. Here you go.
-Thank you, Mr. Earp.
-You're welcome.
Morg, honey, food's ready.
-Come on, sweetie.
-I’ll be right there, little darling.
I’m gonna be sick.
Wyatt, the food's on the table.
Good, Mattie. That way we'll know where to find it when we're finished.
Morg.
In mining claims, we got the Mountain Maid
Mine, the Mattie Blaylock, the Grasshopper.
Why haven't you named a mine after me?
They will, Lou.
They're gonna call the next one the Idiot.
-Damn it, Bessie, you know something--
-Bessie, shut up and have yourself a drink.
Go ahead, Wyatt.
We're about 50-50 between the mines that are producing...
-... and the mines that are--
-Worthless.
That are not producing.
In other words, we ain't seen a dime's profit from the lot.
Not "in other words,” James.
Those are the words.
Incomes, we got our salaries...
... plus James' Sampling Room, and a half interest in the Oriental Faro Bank...
... and a quarter interest in one at the Crystal Palace.
From the sound of it, you'd think we'd have some money by now.
I’m afraid we're about as rich as lawmen are ever gonna be.
When you get through with the talk, that's what we are.
That's good enough for me, sweetheart.
I married you for your looks.
I guess you lost out all around.
We have close to $14,000 cash between us.
Why don't we just split it up, and everybody do what they like?
What we've gotta decide is how to invest it.
Don't you ignore me, Wyatt.
If somebody voted you king of this family,
I didn't hear about it.
You dragged us down here with a lot of talk about owning businesses and getting rich.
Now here you are a year later, a bunch of lawmen and bartenders, just like before.
Some things haven't worked out like we'd like. That's nobody's fault.
-We didn't come here to split up stakes.
-We're trying to build something.
Why does it always have to be the brothers together?
Why can't it just be you and me, James?
They're afraid to say anything, but they're thinking the same as me.
We are your wives. Don't we ever count more than the damn brothers?
No, Bessie, you don't.
Wives come and go, that's the plain truth of it.
They run off.
They die.
You're a cold man, Wyatt Earp.
God forgive you, you are cold.
Morgan.
I’m sorry if I hurt you today.
That was not my intention.
Let's have children, Wyatt.
-Mattie.
-You're always talking about family.
Well, let's have children. A family of our own. Our children, yours and mine.
Before I’m too old for it.
Before I dry up inside.
I can feel it, Wyatt.
A part of me is starting to die.
It’s not too late.
Children aren't a part of the bargain, Mattie.
They never were.
They're no good.
--that you, Frank Stillwell, and you, Pete Spence...
... did, on the evening of September 8,
1881, rob the Sandy Bob stagecoach...
... on the road from Tombstone to Bisbee.
How do you plead?
-Not guilty. And that's not all I gotta say!
-You'll get your chance.
-Spence?
-I didn't do nothing, judge.
It’s all a setup job by those damn Earps and Marshal White.
Look at me, judge.
This is the way they treat you...
...when you come nice and easy-like to defend your good name.
-Nice and easy, my ass.
-Quiet, everyone.
Now, there's enough evidence and eyewitnesses to warrant an indictment.
I’ll set your bail at $7000 each.
-Have you the means?
-They got it!
We'll stand that money, judge.
Get them away from these bastards. before they're lynched!
There ain't an honest cowboy can get a fair shake in this town.
First, why don't you show me an honest cowboy?
Enough! The next man that speaks out will be fined $25 contempt of court.
Your Honor, $25 wouldn't pay for half the contempt I got for this court.
Bailiff, collect $50 from Curly Bill Brocius.
Well...
... didn't take them long to get back on the road.
The Clantons and the McLaurys paid their bail. It’s the law.
-The same for them as it is for you or me.
-Then I guess it don't work too well, John.
Ike, what happened?
You're a little late, Johnny.
What is wrong with you, Fred?
Why didn't you send word...
-...when you caught up with them?
-Didn't know where you were.
I’m the county sheriff!
Those men were caught in my jurisdiction.
-I should've been at that hearing.
-They had enough friends there as it was.
We've been all over hell looking for those two.
Maybe you weren't looking hard enough, Johnny.
All over hell, huh?
Sounds like your jurisdiction, all right.
The outlaw's best friend would like a word with you.
-Hold your bets for the new dealer.
-All right, place your bets.
-Just tonight, Wyatt. To peace.
-No exceptions.
No exceptions.
-That about sums you up, doesn't it?
-What's on your mind?
You're headed for war with Ike Clanton and the men he rides with.
And it's all over nothing.
You and Ike want the same things.
The same things we all want.
-Really?
-That's right. To prosper.
To have some security for our family.
You did not come to Tombstone to be a lawman again, Wyatt.
You are an entrepreneur.
You're full of ideas for making the Earps rich.
Nothing good can come from you interfering...
...with the business of the Clantons and the McLaurys.
Only blood.
But with a little cooperation, a little "live and let live"...
... everyone can make out.
-How's that?
-Money, lots of money...
...to be shared with everyone who helped.
I know you.
-That's what you've always been after.
-You've forgotten something.
-The Clantons and their friends are rustlers.
-What do you care what they do?
-They don't tell you how to run your games.
-They're murderers and thieves.
They rob the stagecoaches my brothers and I are paid to protect.
One of those bastards shot Bud Philpot, who never did a thing to anybody--
Your best friend Doc Holliday is one of the worst killers in this territory.
Some people say he was in on that robbery that got Bud killed.
-Hell, even Big Nose Kate said it.
-That was your work, Johnny.
You got her drunk and mad to say that.
And I’m sick of hearing your lies!
Go to your friends. Tell them, if they wanna make a fight with the Earps...
...they know where to find us!
Good morning, Maria.
-Morning, George.
-Good morning, Virgil.
How are you, George?
Look at Behan.
He'd lick himself all over if he could, he's so whipped up.
-What's with him?
-His woman's coming back...
...from San Francisco on the Prescott stage.
A Jewish girl.
I never knew him to have one woman.
-Guess you haven't seen her yet, Wyatt.
-Oh, he's been busy while she was gone...
... but I reckon he stay home tonight.
-Evening, miss.
-Good evening.
Are you taking a walk?
I am.
Is that a problem?
Could be in this town.
A young woman walking alone in the evening...
... people could get the wrong impression.
What impression would that be?
Far as I know, the red light district...
-... is the other end of town.
-I didn't mean to imply that.
It’s just that you should have an escort.
Well, Mr. Earp, I can either be a shut-in or walk alone on the streets of Tombstone.
I appreciate your concern.
I saw you once before.
Before you came to Tombstone, in Dodge City.
You were in a show.
I know. I saw you too.
I saw you, and then you killed a man.
So I said:
"What are you afraid of, darling?
You're not some Red Injun that thinks the camera's gonna steal your soul. "
And she said, "No, Johnny.
I’m afraid that someone besides you might see it. "
But I assured her that would never happen.
-Bob, you seen James around?
-Not lately, I haven't.
Wyatt, you gotta take a look at this.
Danny, I am sure Marshal Earp is too upstanding, righteous...
... and married...
...to be interested in a naked picture of a young Jewish woman.
-You're a damn fool, Behan.
-Maybe.
But I’m the fool that climbs into bed with that every night.
-What's she doing with you, Johnny?
-Just about anything I can think of.
How much detail do you want?
It ain't right, shooting a man when he don't know it's coming.
-I’ll give him one in the face just for you.
-You ain't doing any shooting tonight.
That's Curly Bill's job. Frank?
-Where's the commotion, Frank?
-Don't worry about that. Got a spot?
-Yeah, I got one.
-We're close.
I don't know if I like that one or not.
It’s not quite my style.
-I like that hat.
-The black one?
All right, boys, let her rip.
Wait for me at home.
Clanton, move!
All right, boys, that's enough.
Put down the guns.
Drop them.
That'll be enough fun for now, Bill.
Hand it over.
Damn, you can't have a little fun in this town.
Whether it was just some drunken fun that got out of control...
... a mistake, as you say, you were just trying to hand over your firearm...
...when it accidentally discharged...
... or whether it was another heinous crime, carefully planned...
... and maliciously premeditated, we'll have to wait for a jury of your peers to decide.
But what we know already is this...
... you have robbed the people of Tombstone of a precious resource.
Fred White was a brave lawman, a loving father and husband...
... a loyal friend and a good man, which you, William Brocius, are not.
Your bail is set at $ 1 5, 000.
Virgil, you're the acting marshal now.
Take him out of my sight.
-Behan's not here.
-I’m not looking for Johnny.
He's horseshit.
We found something to agree on.
Maybe you've heard about the private photograph...
... my former fiancé was showing around?
Or maybe you've seen it.
It seems every man in town has.
-You shouldn't be in here.
-I’ve been in worse places than this.
You mean you want me to go somewhere with you?
I heard a story about you.
About you and a prisoner named Tommy O'Rourke.
Tommy Behind-the-Deuce, they called him.
Is it true what they say?
How you saved him?
People make up a lot of things.
Sometimes even I don't know what really happened.
I know this though...
...the stories are always better.
Is Mattie Earp your wife?
We've been together a while.
She uses my name.
I owe her that at the least.
I’m not gonna marry Johnny Behan.
I never thought you would.
-What would you know about it, Mr. Earp?
-Wyatt.
You don't know anything about me.
I knew a lot about you the minute you got off that stagecoach.
Like what?
That you're a brave young woman.
That you came out to a place like this on your own...
...to a man you knew wasn't right for you...
... because you liked the adventure of it all.
I’ve never been afraid of much.
You're afraid to say my name.
Why would I be afraid of that?
Because you know once you do, that'll be it.
You've got a lot of confidence, Mr. Earp.
I believe you're trying to seduce me.
What do people call you?
Josie.
Josie.
What makes you different from all the men who've tried what you're trying?
-I guess you know, Josie.
-No, I don't.
Then say it.
All right.
I don't know what you're talking about...
... Wyatt.
Come on, Brocius, let's go.
Come on!
Get on your horse, Bill, before they shoot you down in cold blood.
You had your last chance, and you let it go.
There ain't gonna be no more talking.
-You talk too much for a fighting man, Ike.
-Wyatt.
I’ve seen your kind my whole life.
There's never been but one way...
-...to deal with any of you.
-Your day is coming. Get ready.
Why not make it today?
I cannot speak for everyone, but personally...
... I am getting sick to my stomach of all your empty yellow talk.
If you wanna make a fight with these boys, why not get it over with...
-... right now?
-You're the first on my list, Holliday.
Spend the rest of your time waiting to see me.
McLaury, seeing you would be a nice change.
I understand most of your enemies got it in the back.
We ain't through.
I think we ought to just kill them all.
You know, Morg, Wyatt's my friend, but I believe I’m beginning to love you.
Wyatt, tell me about Missouri.
I loved a girl, Josie.
I loved her more than I’ll ever love anyone else as long as I live.
I married her, and we were going to have a child, and she died.
And our child with her.
I wanted to die too.
I burned everything we owned.
The pictures...
...the baby clothes she'd made...
... ribbons from her hair.
I tried to burn out everything
I’d felt back there.
Wyatt...
... I’m not asking for any more than you can give me.
I just wanna be close to you.
I wanna be lying here next to you when we're 80.
I never thought about living that long.
But if I do, you can bet all I’ll be doing is lying here.
Then we better not waste any time.
Wyatt, I think you better come with me.
Doc Goodfellow says she's gonna be okay.
She took a dose of laudanum with her whiskey.
It looks like she was trying to kill herself.
Lucky we found her in time.
Lucky somebody came around.
Where would she get this?
Probably over in Chinatown.
It’s not hard to find in Tombstone.
Mattie.
Mattie.
Go back to your Jew whore.
If I was married to him,
I'd drink a gallon of the stuff.
Allie, shut up.
It's all right, dear.
Wyatt.
-Give me a bottle and a glass, Clem.
-What?
Don't make me ask you twice.
Gentlemen, this game is losing its allure.
I'm out.
Don't mind if I do.
If you're gonna break the fast, the least you can do is invite a friend.
-I’m not in the mood for talking, Doc.
-You know how it is with me.
You don't have to do much talking when I’m around.
Wyatt, you ever wonder why we've been a part...
... of so many unfortunate incidents, yet we're still walking around?
I have figured it out.
It’s nothing much, just luck.
And you know why it's nothing much, Wyatt?
Because it doesn't matter much whether we're here today or not.
I wake up every morning looking in the face of death, and you know what?
He ain't half bad.
I think the secret old Mr. Death is holding...
... is that it's better for some of us over on the other side.
I know it can't be any worse for me.
Maybe that's the place for your Mattie.
For some people this world ain't ever gonna be right.
Is that supposed to let me off the hook?
There is no hook, my friend.
There's only what we do.
Well, it won't be for long.
After tomorrow, this town's gonna smell a whole lot better.
-Ike, why don't you slow down on that?
-Don't tell me to slow down.
I’ve waited long enough as it is.
Those Earps and their skinny diseased friend...
... are gonna find out what a real fight is all about.
I’m moving on.
If you're smart, you'll go back to the hotel to get some sleep.
You're gonna need some help if you're gonna take on the Earps.
I got friends. They're coming tomorrow. You'll see.
And then this town is gonna thank us for what we done.
Ike, if you're gonna talk like that, you'd best take it somewheres else.
Good evening.
-How you fellas doing?
-Not bad. Good to see you.
Shut up, I’m tired of hearing your noise.
Ike.
I hear you're gonna kill me.
-Get out your gun and commence.
-I ain't heeled, Doc.
You scum-sucking bastard, if you ain't heeled, go and arm yourself.
I shall meet you in the street.
-Who'll give this yellow-bellied prick a gun?
-Doc. Doc, that's enough.
I ain't gonna fight you tonight, Doc, but your fight's coming soon enough.
My mama always told me never put off till tomorrow people you can kill today.
-Doc, he ain't armed, and he's drunk.
-There ain't no law against killing drunks.
If you intend to open your lying mouth about me or my friends again...
...then go heeled and ready to fight!
-Josie, what are you doing here?
-Ike Clanton's been going around...
... saying they're gonna shoot the first Earp who shows his face.
Just Ike?
Wyatt, come away with me now.
We'll leave the trouble behind and go.
-Leave? I’m not gonna leave.
-Please, Wyatt.
I don't wanna see you shot down in a street fight I don't understand.
This is where we live.
My brothers and me, we've staked it all on this place.
It’s nothing, Wyatt. It’s a mining camp, dirty and small-minded.
It’s our home...
... and I’m not leaving, Josie.
Not for the Clantons or the McLaurys or anybody.
Not even you.
Then give me a gun.
Give me a gun, I’ll kill anyone who tries to hurt you.
Go home, Josie.
Thinking about you could get me killed.
Wyatt.
I love you, Wyatt.
If you leave me, I’ll kill myself.
I’ll do it this time, I swear.
I swear before God Almighty
I will kill myself. It'll be on your head.
Do you hear me?
If you don't break off with that whore, you will come back and find me dead.
Talk to me, you cold-hearted son of a bitch.
There are men out there
I may have to kill, Mattie.
I don't have time for this today.
Virg.
Marshal, they're around there, sir.
You heard?
You know how many?
I wonder if Curly Bill and them boys come in.
-What did you hear?
-Ike's been up all night drinking...
...trying to screw up the courage to kill us.
Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Billy Claiborne came in this morning.
-Curly Bill? Indian Charlie?
-I don't know, Morg.
Could be anybody's here.
-Where's Holliday?
-He hasn't been around.
All right, let him sleep.
How do you wanna handle this, Wyatt?
I’m gonna have some coffee.
-Give me one of those cigars.
-Sure.
Is there gonna be a fight, Wyatt?
I think there must be.
Do you want some help?
Thanks, Clem.
They just moved out of the O. K. Corral down by Fly's.
It looks like Ike and Billy Clanton...
...the McLaurys, Billy Claiborne.
Maybe more.
Let's go.
Where the hell are you going?
-We're going down the street.
-I think I’ll join you.
We intend to disarm them and take them in, Doc. You understand?
Oh, I understand, Virgil, but do you think they will?
Put that under your coat.
No use provoking them until we get a chance to talk.
Hell, I’ve heard enough talk already.
There is likely to be some trouble.
Now hold on here.
-Don't go down there. There'll be trouble.
-We're just gonna take their guns.
No. No, there's no need for that,
I disarmed them.
Then there won't be any trouble, Johnny.
Let them have it.
All right.
You sons of bitches have been looking for a fight. Now you can have it.
Throw up your hands.
I want your guns.
No, Frank, don't shoot!
Wyatt! Wyatt, no, I didn’t want this!
I ain't armed! I ain't-- Billy!
Billy, no! Billy!
F rank! F rank!
Frank.
Look out. Get out of my way.
Take them down to the house, Jack.
Allie, don't let him move too much.
Wyatt, I’m taking you in.
No, he didn't. No, he didn't.
Easy, Morg. Easy, Morg.
-Where's Virg and Doc?
-Don't try and talk.
-Where's the doctor?
-Yonder.
Wyatt, I’m gonna have to arrest you. Wyatt!
Get him down to the house.
I’m not gonna be arrested today, Johnny.
Not by you and not by anybody else.
In the name of God, Wyatt, there has been enough blood today.
I reckon that's the Earp family business.
Wyatt.
-Oh, God, are you all right?
-I’m okay, Josie.
-You go home now.
-No, I wanna stay--
Josie, go home. It might not be over.
-John, would you see her home?
-Miss, Wyatt's right.
They murdered them!
Them Earps shot them in cold blood!
Ike's been in here all morning threatening to kill them. It was a fair fight!
Break it up. Break it up.
Everybody who's not family, get out.
Allie, clear this chair for her.
-Don't tell me what to do in my own home.
-Allie.
Men may be coming into town to kill us all today.
It’s not important what you think of me.
We have to cooperate.
So clear the goddamn chair!
What happened to her?
This, a lot of it.
Oh, Lord.
Mattie. Come on, Mattie.
Nobody by the house, Jack.
It’s your fault this happened.
I wanted to get away from here, but he wouldn't leave you.
You and your precious brothers.
Well, damn you to hell, Wyatt Earp.
Well, here we are...
... one big happy family.
-Wyatt.
-John.
-What are you doing here with him?
-Wyatt, I’m here as your friend.
We have warrants for you, Doc, Morgan, and Virgil for the crime of murder.
Your brothers can stay here until they recover...
... but he's here to bring you in.
Behan was afraid if he came with his deputies, there'd be blood shed.
-Johnny's not as dumb as I thought.
-Wyatt, the warrants are legal.
I won't let them use the law to kill me and my family, John.
-I won't allow that.
-What'll it take, Wyatt?
I need to know my family is safe.
You boys are finally treating me the way I deserve to be treated.
-Let's drop him, Jack.
-You got it.
-And that one's Wyatt's.
-I’ll come back for the rest of them.
-Easy, now.
-Virg.
Ain't no fire.
-I don't wanna go to no hotel.
-We're all going.
I don't wanna.
Where's my medicine?
Did you take my medicine?
I want--I want my medicine.
Allie, help her.
-Calm down, dear.
-What?
Tell me, what is it?
-We got somebody on the roof?
-No.
All right, put somebody up there, Sherm.
No. No.
You son of a bitch, you've brought your whore.
-Mattie.
-You think I haven't heard?
You think I haven’t heard them laughing behind my back.
-Wyatt and his Heeb whore.
-Mattie!
-I won't stay under the same roof with that.
-Don't you talk about me.
-Who is she? I’m your wife.
-Goddamn it, that's enough!
-Wyatt, I told you this would happen.
-Both of you!
I’m your wife. I am.
I’m your wife, Wyatt.
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet, please.
In view of the controversies between the Earps, Clantons and the McLaurys...
... and the quarrel the night before between Isaac Clanton and John Holliday...
... I am of the opinion that the defendant,
Virgil Earp, as chief of police...
... subsequently calling upon his brothers and Holliday to assist him...
... in arresting and disarming the Clantons and the McLaurys...
... committed an injudicious and censurable act.
-No.
-Ridiculous. They were keeping the peace.
Yet when you consider the existence of a law-defying element in our midst...
... and consider the many threats made against the Earps...
... I can attach no criminality to his unwise act.
Moreover, the evidence taken before me in this case would not, in my judgment...
...warrant a conviction of the defendants by trial jury of any offense whatever.
I order the defendants to be released.
Lou.
A blind man could have made that shot.
Now you're gonna have to show me something.
Look who don't know if he's coming or going.
You're just in time to watch me whip Bob's ass for, what, 50th time?
"Fiftieth time?"
Wyatt, maybe you can answer a question that's been dogging me for years.
What's that?
How come Morgan here is the only Earp who's completely full of shit?
Bob, the whole family wants to know the answer to that one.
-Get down. Hide yourself. Find a gun.
-Take that gun!
-We sent for the doctor and Lou, Wyatt.
-It’s gonna be all right, Morg.
Go find James and Virgil Earp. Go.
Marshal Earp, you gotta come quick.
It’s your brother, Morgan.
-What's wrong?
-He's at Hatch's. Hurry.
They got me, Wyatt.
Don't let them get you.
You're not gonna die on me, Morg.
I won't let you.
Set my legs out straight.
They are, Morg.
It won't be long now.
-Where's Lou?
-She's coming.
She's coming.
Wyatt.
I heard gunfire.
I came to see what's going on.
No.
No. No! No!
How is he?
You can see for yourself.
Wyatt, he wants to take my arm.
Don't let him cut it off.
You heard him, doc.
Either way he's gonna be a cripple, if he doesn't bleed to death.
At least I’ll be a two-armed corpse.
Virg, please.
You never mind. I still got one good arm to hug you with.
Where's Morgan?
Where's Morgan?
Careful.
I don't want them taking a shot at you.
I’m...
... so sorry, Wyatt.
I loved that boy...
... like he was my own little brother.
What do you wanna do?
Kill them all.
-Hold it right there.
-I was just going in.
-Nobody's going in there.
-Well, I’m here to see Wyatt Earp.
Who's here to see Wyatt Earp?
It’s all right.
I’ve come to help bring Morgan home to Ma and Pa in California.
I’m glad you're here, Warren.
-It’s time to go now, Mattie.
-Sure, sugar.
Off to California with the Earps.
You're the only brother that hasn't been shot.
That's not fair.
Wyatt!
-Wyatt!
-It’s all right.
It was an accident.
Mattie.
Mattie, if you wanna go on the train with the others, you'll have to go now.
I don't know when I’ll be back here.
Go to hell.
When you do come back, I’ll be gone.
If you keep up with that stuff, it'll kill you.
What do you care?
I don't anymore.
John Holliday?
Wyatt.
It’s from Bob Paul in Tucson.
He says Ike Clanton, Frank Stillwell, and their friends are in Tucson.
They've been watching the trains.
Somebody in Tombstone told them we were coming.
Good.
We'll go as far as Tucson, get you out of the territory.
You'll stay on the train and help James and the women...
... get Virgil and Morg back to California.
James and them can get Morgan back.
Wyatt, if you're going after the men that did this, I’m going with you.
All aboard!
Warren.
James will watch the back door.
You watch that one.
Anybody tries to come on, shoot them.
You murdered my brother.
No!
Yes.
Wyatt!
It’s me, Sherm.
Wyatt.
Wyatt!
Okay, Wyatt.
Let's go.
It’s all right, Virgil.
That's one for Morgan.
Wyatt.
Finish it.
Marshal Earp.
Thought you better take a look at this.
I haven't shown it to Sheriff Behan yet.
-Your brother was a good man.
-I’m grateful, Albert.
They got a warrant out for us on Stillwell already.
-I guess everybody in Tucson saw us there.
-Oh, really?
Even with you being so quiet and all?
Better collect our things and go.
Sherm, see if the two Jacks will take a ride with us.
Wyatt.
-You're still a marshal here, ain't you?
-Sure.
But now he's gonna be a marshal and an outlaw.
The best of both worlds, son.
I missed you.
I want you to go home to your folks in San Francisco.
When I can, I’ll come and get you.
When will that be?
I have some men I have to see.
I don't know where that'll take me.
I’ll be expecting you every day.
-I’m broke. You know that.
-It doesn't matter.
There's nothing left to hold you here.
There's....
I was gonna say my family.
I’ll be your family, Wyatt.
I’ll give you children.
We'll make our own place where no one will find us.
And I won't die on you.
I swear it.
You were right, Josie.
We stayed too long.
You couldn't have been trying to arrest him. Not with 20 bullets in him.
No, I wasn’t trying to arrest him.
I don't know what to say to that.
This is my will, John.
I’ve named you as executor.
Not that there's much left.
This is not a jungle, Wyatt.
We have laws.
Yes, we do.
If those men think they can hide behind those laws, then they've missed their guess.
Goodbye, John.
Wyatt. Wyatt.
I wanna see you.
Johnny, you're not careful, you'll see me once too often.
Looking for Pete Spence.
He no here.
Go to Tombstone.
How about the one they call Indian Charlie?
Something bothering you?
What makes you so sure
Ringo, Spence, and Curly Bill...
... are with this pack we're trailing now?
-They're up here, all right.
-How do you know?
-That's what Texas Jack's friend told me.
-Maybe he's wrong.
Maybe it's just ordinary rustlers out about their business.
You gonna shoot all of them too?
-You can take off whenever you want.
-Go to hell.
You can't get what you want, Wyatt.
You can't kill them all.
Look...
... I’m dead anyway.
So if you wanna go out in a blaze of glory...
... I’m with you.
But if you wanna live....
What do you want me to do, forget about it?
Just wait.
Get out of Arizona for a while.
Make them think it's over.
Then we'll come back later.
We'll pick them off...
... one at a time.
You need to go to Colorado.
One of those sanitariums in the mountains.
I’ll go...
... if you'll take me.
You've been a good friend to me, Doc.
Shut up.
Johnny Ringo!
Wyatt, let's get out of here!
Show me where our gold is, Wyatt.
Point it out.
Right there.
Well, that doesn't look so tough.
No, I imagine we can pick most of it up in just a day's excursion out of Nome.
The problem will be lugging it back to town.
What are we gonna do with all our money?
We'll buy you a new suit.
You could use one.
Excuse me. I’m sorry to bother...
... but are you by any chance Wyatt Earp?
My name's Francis O'Rourke. I believe you saved my uncle's life one time...
... in Tombstone, Arizona.
That's the story my father told us, anyway, many times. Believe me.
-This is my wife, Josie.
-It’s an honor, ma’am.
I’m afraid my husband has saved so many lives...
... it's hard for him to keep track of them all.
Well, you'd remember this, if the story's true.
My uncle's name was Tommy O'Rourke.
They called him Tommy Behind-the-Deuce.
I thought so.
Guess my father's story's true.
He said my uncle killed a mining man named Schneider in a card game.
This Schneider fellow was very popular, and pretty soon a lynch mob had formed.
They were coming down to jail to take Tommy out and string him up.
Marshal!
Marshal Earp, give me a gun!
For God's sake, let me protect myself!
Tommy, if I hear one more sound out of you, I’m gonna help them do it.
It seems your brothers were off collecting renegade Indians in another town.
You were all alone.
They were shouting that they ought to just shoot you, take Tommy with them.
Finally, when they quieted down, you said:
Nice mob you got here.
-I said, we want Tommy O'Rourke!
-Yeah!
Get set for disappointment, because you're not gonna get him.
-He killed one of my men.
-He killed a man!
He'll stand trial for that.
You arrogant son of a bitch.
You think you can stop all of us?
You boys can get me.
That won't be any problem with all the guns you got here.
But I’m taking 1 0 or 1 2 of you with me.
Starting with you, Dick Gird.
And you, McGee.
Maybe you too, Harvey.
So if any of you want Tommy...
... and you want me...
... come up front with these brave men.
We'll all go together.
Anyway, that's what my father told us.
What happened to your Uncle Tommy?
He was shot dead up at Omaha in '87.
Guess he wasn't worth saving.
Anyway, it's an honor...
... Mr. Earp, sir.
Ma'am.
Some people say it didn't happen that way.
Never mind them, Wyatt.
It happened that way.
- Whoo! Yeah!
That brings us now to our final team, ladies and gentlemen.
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis. Keep your eyes right on the roping chutes.
These could be our 1993 champion team ropers.
Our boys are just about ready. Keep your eyes right on the roping chute.
Sonny makes a good head catch.
Now Pepper rides in, throws it down, goes to the horn... they turn and face, and the time is in!
Checking our official timers.
How 'bout a 5.4!
Ladies and gentlemen, that might be good enough to win the state championship!
The 1993 New Mexico
State Champion Team Ropers...
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis.
Good goin', boys!
- Thank you!
Hey, Carlos.
How ya doin'?
- Mr. Stark.
- Hey, stuff looks nice.
Looks really nice.
Look, there's some money missing from petty cash.
- You know anything about it?
- Uh, uh, no, sin'.
Right. All right.
I just thought I'd ask around.
It's good to see you,
Carlos.
You steal from me, and then you lie to me about it in my face?
Did you take my money?
- Yes! Yes!
- Good! That's what I like to hear.
That's what I like to hear. Now... you pay me back, and I won't add the amount to your debt.
- All right?
- Mr. Stark.
El Señor Huerta's downstain's.
He's by the docks.
What the hell is he doin' down here?
Manny. Havert seen you down here in a while.
- John, I don't like this.
- What?
No, no. Look at this old woman.
She won't live long enough to work off her debt.
That's why I came down here tonight.
I have been getting complaints, John.
Manny, you know it's not an exact system.
We don't always get what we expect.
Qué pasa?
Buscas a alguien?
Dónde está mi papa?
- Quién?
- Mi papá.
Tú vaya con el grupo primero, okay?
She says she wants her father.
- What is she talking about?
- Manny, I don't know.
Am I supposed to be personally responsible for everybody that comes off that boat?
Look, I'll call our people on the other side... and I'll handle this, okay?
Make sure you do that.
All right?
Bueno.
Bienvenidos a los
Estados Unidos de América.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together... and welcome Miss Espanola Valley,
Melba Van Buren!
We're gonna move to the calf roping event next... if we can get these two clowns out of the arena.
I don't know what they're doin' out there... but if they're not careful...
Well, lookee what the cat drug in.
Hey, Melba. Lookin' more gorgeous that ever.
Mm-mm-mm.
- All righty.
- Well, here's mine, boys.
- You all gonna wish me luck?
- Shit!
You fellas gonna be cryin' all the way home tonight.
- What's the deal here, boys?
- Hundred bucks a man.
- One ride, winner takes all. Just the same as always.
- You in, Pepper?
Hobby horse have a hickory dick? 'Course I'm in.
Bullshit, Pepper. I ain't ridin' to win no I.O.U. From you.
Yeah, Pepper, you can keep your damn old I.O.U.
That there's good as gold.
When you know me not to pay my debt?
Shit! When we know you to pay 'em?
Hell, you still owe me from last April.
April? Hell, he still owes me ten bucks from high school.
You didn't get my check,
Eddie? I sent it U.P.S.
You never. You're a lyin' little son of a bitch, Pepper.
- Who you callin' "little," asshole?
- You, you little son of a bitch!
He throws his hands in the ain'.
Get away from him, cowboy!
The time is in for Mike Ray.
The time is nine seconds flat!
Let him ride.
Yeah, Sonny. What the hell.
Let him ride.
Sonny.
Sonny. Ho! Wait up!
Thanks, man. You just saved Eddie about four teeth back there.
You win that prize money tonight, you're payin' off all your debts.
You understand me? Otherwise, it's gonna be me kickin' your ass tonight.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you just try kickin' it right now, okay?
Be better than this Eskimo treatment you been givin' me all year long.
You heard me, Pepper.
Luke Short, Jim Wilshin'e, our next team out.
Luke rides up, makes a nice, quick head catch.
Now Jim's gotta ride in.
Throws it down, go to the horn.
Turn and face, and the time...
- Chili Pepper.
Nacho.
Good to see you, man.
- Cómo estás?
- Where the hell have you been?
Oh, I been with the worms in Mexico.
- Ay, Chihuahua!
- I miss your cookin'.
You talk to Sonny?
Come on, Pepper.
Sonny will forgive you.
Oh, yeah? When?
That rodeo was a year ago.
He ain't said six words to me since.
I told him I was sorry.
What's he want?
Sonny don't care about words.
You have to show him.
Yeah, well, I ain't gonna kiss his ass, if that's what you mean.
So sour, probably tastes like a damn old lemon anyhow.
Don't give up on him. You've been friends too long for that.
Yeah, well, I had a reason for not showin' up at that rodeo.
Tell him what it was.
He will understand.
Maybe someday, when he ain't bein' such a damn shit-ass.
- Buena suerte.
- Thanks, viejo.
- Good luck on your ride.
- I don't need luck. I need sleep.
Senoritas.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm single.
- Pepper's still trying to make up, huh?
- Yeah, well, I ain't listenin'.
He's your friend.
You two guys should be out there chasing that steer together right now.
Friend don't pull a no-show at a national rodeo final, Nacho. Not in my book.
I had plans for that money.
You know that.
Nothing in your book about forgiving?
Nacho, Pepper and I are through, okay?
You got a heart the size of a tiny raisin, you know that?
Why don't you just hand me my bronc rein?
If you only knew what it was to be alone... you would treasure your friend.
Where you goin'?
- Home. I'm going home.
- You're not gonna stay and watch me ride?
No. You're a hardheaded donkey with a heart the size of a tiny raisin, and I don't want to watch you ride.
You better have a pot of coffee waitin' for me when I get home.
Next cowboy out this afternoon...
Sonny Gilstrap from Belen, New Mexico.
High Dive is the name of the bucking horse he's drawn this afternoon.
Easy, boy. I got him. I got him.
There we go. There we go.
There we go.
Seventy-five's the score the cowboy's tryin' to beat... to take the lead in the bronc riding this afternoon.
An excellent ride for Sonny Gilstrap.
This could be a high score.
Hard to beat that one.
Maybe for you.
- Shit.
Seventy-seven points... for that cowboy!
Let's move up to chute number five.
Keep your eyes right there.
Pepper Lewis, Belen, New Mexico, is gonna be our next cowboy.
Lone Star is the name of the bucking horse he's drawn.
- This cowboy's gotta do better than 77 points...
- Okay now.
If he wants to take the lead in the bronc riding this afternoon.
Take it easy now.
He's just about ready.
Say when, buddy.
Lemme have the old hammerheaded son of a bitch.
Damn! Well, there goes our money.
- Hope to hell you're happy.
- God, I hate that little peckerwood!
You oughta not let him in the jackpot, Sonny.
That old Pepper sure can cowboy, can't he? When he wants to.
The judges signal:
Seventy-nine points for the cowboy!
Seventy-nine!
Hello?
Yes, this is
Nacho Salazar.
What? Teresa? My daughter
Teresa is in New York City?
God's blessing on you,
Señor Stark.
I'll go get her right away.
Good, good. And please make sure you bring the other $5,000 with you.
Five thousand? But I already paid, Señor Stark.
That's what I thought too, but the people I work for... said you agreed to pay another 5,000 on delivery.
No, no, no. That was not the agreement.
Well, look, I could try talking to them... but I don't think it would do any good.
- Maybe we could go to the police.
- Wait a second, Mr. Salazar.
Think about what you're saying. Your daughter is in this country illegally.
Yes, of course.
You're right.
All these people are interested is in the money.
- And all you care about is your daughter.
- But what can I do?
Is there any way you can get the money?
Yes, I think I can get it.
- Good, good.
- How can I get in touch with you?
My number's 212-555-4320.
You got that?
Yes, I have it.
Señor Stark, my daughter, is she okay?
She's fine. Just think, in a couple of days... you two will be together again.
Good night,
Mr. Salazar.
"Dear Sonny. Praise God, my daughter
Teresa is out of Cuba.
I've gone to New York City to pick her up.
I will telephone you as soon as possible about your guns.
Forgive me. I did not know what else to do. "
"P.S. Here's your damn coffee. "
Where are you, Big Chief?
Now, where are you?
I don't wanna play if you ain't gonna play fain'. Oh!
Big Chief on trail of naked paleface woman.
Oh. Oh, no.
What are you gonna do when you find naked paleface woman, Big Chief?
Big Chief gonna teach naked paleface woman to play his tom-tom.
- Is much fun for Big Chief.
- Oh, no. Not that.
Oh!
Oh. Big Chief.
Now time for naked paleface woman... to make Big Chief happy chief.
Oh. Why, you wicked old heathen!
Pepper?
Pepper?
Sonny?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Got any of that prize money left over from the other night?
- Sure. Why?
- Need to borrow it.
- How come?
- None of your business. You gonna loan it to me?
- Yeah. How much you need?
- How much you got?
Just one minute.
I'll check.
- Hey, Sonny.
- Melba.
Big Chief catch you yet?
He just about had me when you drove up.
You wanna play?
No, thanks.
You used to like to play, remember?
- Yeah, well, you're a married woman now, Melba.
That don't bother
Pepper none.
Yeah, well, not much does, does it?
Oh, hey. Keep the wigwam warm for me, baby.
Mmm.
I will return.
Where the hell you think you're goin'?
You tell me.
You sure as hell ain't goin' nowhere with me.
- Where you goin'?
- New York City.
New York City? What the hell's in New York City?
- Nacho.
- Nacho?
He was supposed to pick up his daughter and call me. That was five days ago.
- You reckon he run into trouble?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
- Let's get goin'.
- I said, you ain't goin' nowhere with me.
- You might need my help.
- I counted on your help once before, remember?
You gonna loan me that money or not?
You want my money, not me, is that it?
- That's it.
- Well, my money goes where I go, you know that?
- You go where your money goes, is that a fact?
- Yessin'ee, that's a fact.
- I'm a businessman.
- Well, Mr. Businessman, guess what?
You and your money can both get the hell outta my truck...
'cause I don't want either one of you now.
Okay.
I'd rather play
Big Chief anyhow!
Good.
Don't slam the door.
And another thing... I wouldn't throw a bucket of water on your ass if it was drownin'!
Good. I wouldn't want you to neither!
Pepper! Get out!
Nacho's my friend!
I'm goin' to help him, not you!
Get out.
Aaah!
Okay. You wanna go? You can go, but you're ridin' back here, you understand me?
- I swear to God, you are not getting up front with me.
- Not polite to swear to God.
Oh, God! Hey!
- Sonny... Shit!
- Hey.
- Hey!
I told you, Pepper, you ain't ridin' up front with me.
I don't wanna get up front. I'm just curious what the hell's goin' on.
All I know is Nacho's been payin' this guy for the last couple years... to get his daughter outta Cuba.
When I got home, there was a note sayin' she was in New York City... and he'd gone to get her.
Nacho must've been hot to get there if he left before you got home.
Wouldrt you be if someone snuck your daughter outta Cuba?
I wouldn't let my daughter go to Cuba.
She didn't go to Cuba.
She was born there.
She never been nowhere else.
Always somethin'.
You gotta give 'em one thing, though.
Them Cubans make a damn fine cigar.
- Okay, goddamn it, you can ride up front with me... but I don't want you yappin' my ear off, you understand me?
Peculiar how things work out, ain't it?
I mean, one minute,
I'm playin' Big Chief.
Next minute, I'm on my way to New York City.
One day, never been east of Tulsa.
Next day, boom! I'm east of Tulsa.
Peculiar.
Yeah. Woo, woo, woo, woo.
You believe in hypnotism?
I can hypnotize you while you're drivin'... only it's probably not good to do while you're drivin'.
This old boy... has got this dead-drunk horse passed out in his bed.
So old Tug, who's pretty well shit-faced himself... takes one look at this horse and says...
I don't care what old Tug says.
I don't care what you say. You been sayin' it for the last 24 hours straight.
- You don't wanna hear the rest of the story?
- No, I don't!
I don't wanna hear you talk no more!
- You don't wanna hear me talk no more?
- That's right.
- Okay. That's the way you want it, fine. No more talkin'.
- Good.
Pepper, how far did that sign say it was to the interstate?
So where you wanna eat?
Okay, Pepper, finish your damn story.
So Tug takes one look at this horse and says...
"Well, she ain't pretty, but I wouldn't kick her outta bed for eatin' oats. "
Oh, Lordy.
Good to be talkin' again.
- Sonny?
- Yeah.
Big, ain't it?
Yeah.
Whoo! Yeah!
Boy, I like this city.
You ever heard such a racket in your life?
- Huh?
- You ever heard such a...
Forget it.
Hey, how we supposed to track down
Nacho in all this madness?
He left a New York number on the desktop.
Called it up. Turns out it's this place called "La Habanita. "
- Little Havana.
- That's right.
So I called 'em up and asked if a Cuban named Nacho Salazar had been there.
- You know what that bastard did to me?
- What?
He hung up.
I wish I knew his name.
I'd whup his rude ass for ya.
Hey! You know where
Club La Habanita is?
- What'd he say?
- Wa-hee, wa-hee, wa-canna?
- Italian, huh?
- I believe so.
This one's gone.
- The L's are gone from this one.
- Must be a phone book thief on the loose.
I'll try information.
Oh, here.
This works.
Howdy. Hey.
Operator said it was on Perez Street. Right there.
- One last little piece.
- Goddamn it, Pepper!
You're rippin' out all my ear hain's.
That'll teach ya not to look at a phone 'fore you stick it to your ear.
There it is.
Operator said Perez.
Looks more like Juarez.
You two goin' in there?
- Sure. Why not?
- Yes, indeed, sin'.
Why not? Why not?
Why not?
Fella there's about three bricks shy of a load if you ask me.
Hey, hey.
Dance, senorita?
Come on, Pepper.
Hey. Come on. She likes me.
There's a huge warehouse in Newark. It's in probate.
You could put
300 workers in there.
Hell, it's big enough to let 'em live there.
- How much?
- Quarter of a million.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
I know a guy downtown... who can get us that same kind of space for half that price.
- Howdy.
- Hola.
Can I have a whiskey and a beer, please?
Yeah, a beer and a mescal.
Hold the lime, hold the lemon.
It's a mighty nice place you got here.
Hell of a nice place.
Friend told us about it.
He was here the other night. Maybe you remember him. A guy named Nacho Salazar.
Chubby fella about yea tall. Come here from New Mexico to fetch his daughter.
Guess not.
Sonny, I'd like to make a toast.
We, uh, spent a little time apart over the past year... but it's nice to just be back... Okay.
Mm. Ohh!
Howdy.
Hey, man, por qué tú no yippee-hi-yay pa' fuera, huh?
Sonny, I don't think this fella likes us.
Yeah, well, don't go causing no trouble.
Probably just don't speak English. Howdy.
Speak English?
Sabe English?
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I was gonna tell you... your face looks like a hatful of assholes.
Sonny, did you see what this pukehead just did?
Yeah, well, maybe if you werert bein' so rude. Try a little politeness.
- "Politeness"?
- Politeness. We're in the city now.
Okay. Politeness.
Uh, sin', I apologize for my rude behavior.
I don't know what came over me. Bartender?
Could I get a beer for my new friend here?
See, a little common courtesy goes a long way, Pepper.
Amazin', ain't it?
Oh, here's your beer.
Goddamn it, Pepper!
Howdy.
Sonny!
Y tus sombreros de mierdas!
Thanks for breakin' my fall.
Here's your hat.
- Why not? Why not?
- Here's your hat.
Well, now you know why not.
Eh, gringos?
Let's get out of here.
- Te llamo mañana.
- Pronto, huh?
Okay.
- What was all that about?
- I don't know. I'll find out, though.
You better take off.
We could get some cops.
John, uh... You were out of line earlier.
I'm sorry, Manny.
I just...
I just don't want this guy tryin' to rip you off.
This guy is a friend of mine for 30 years.
Who was it always told me about mixing business and friendship?
Always watching my back, eh, John?
Yeah, Manny, I am.
Always.
- Who were they?
- Two cowboys from New Mexico.
They're looking for that old Cuban.
How much do they know?
They know he was here looking for his daughter.
I don't think they know nothing else.
We made sure they won't be back.
Oh, you did, huh?
I hope you're right.
Ow. Boy. Hell of a town.
- Ain't been here five minutes, already got our asses whupped.
- Thanks to you.
Here. Take a bite of this pepper.
Go ahead.
Cures what ails ya.
At least we know someone in there knows somethin'.
- You figure?
- Hell, yeah.
Second I mentioned Nacho's name, we got them two damn gorillas standin' right next to us.
- So what now?
- We find us a motel and sleep on it, I reckon.
Oh, hey. Hook a left.
That looks like a motel right there.
A bit uptown for us, ain't it, Pepper?
Don't worry about a thing.
You're my guest.
- Howdy do?
- Hidy what?
Hidy... He... Hello.
Uh, welcome to the Waldorf.
May I help you?
Yeah. Uh, me and my partner could use a couple beds. We just blew into town.
- We ain't from around here.
- Really?
Um, just fill this out.
Right away. Fill that out, will ya,
Sonny? I'll take care of the finances.
Okay.
You're a real cowboy, aren't you?
Been accused of it a time or two, ma'am.
Well, hell, yeah, we're real cowboys.
What the hell?
Damn!
Well, there you go.
Little piece of New Mexico right there.
Hey, uh, you know, we were thinkin' maybe later... to go to a museum, maybe take in an opera or two.
How's that sound to you?
Will this be cash or credit card, sin'?
Personal check, if you don't mind, little darlin'.
I can't believe she didn't take my damn check.
You ain't got no account. I don't know why you didn't just pay cash.
Cash? After she insulted me like that? Hell, no.
At least we can get a bite while we're here.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
And how would you gentlemen like those steaks prepared?
"Prepared"?
Oh, you mean cooked.
Yes, sin'. "Cooked" is most definitely what
I should have said. Do excuse me, please.
How would you like those steaks cooked?
Well, just knock its horns off, wipe its nasty old ass, and chunk it down on the plate.
Same for me, please.
I will give chef your instructions exactly.
And would you care to order wine with your meal?
Uh, yeah. Why don't you bring us a bottle of somethin'-or-other?
Uh, not too sweet.
American.
American something-or-other.
Yes, sin'. An excellent choice.
And would you like to have glasses, or do you prefer to drink din'ectly from the bottle?
Well, uh, glasses, I reckon.
Oh, and hey, toss a little ice in mine if you would, my good man.
Ice. Certainly, sin'.
Nothing could surprise me now.
Hey, tell that cook he better not screw up them steaks. We're particular about our meat.
Thank you, Pepper.
I hope you enjoy this bottle as much as you did the previous two.
Mmm. Hmm.
I been thinkin'. We got but one choice tomorrow.
I think we oughta boot on over to the police station.
Let them handle it.
I must say... they've done a fine job with this steak.
I don't understand why they gift-wrap these little lemons... but the steak is mighty tasty.
For all we know, Nacho could've gotten drunk... and thrown in jail.
It don't really matter.
Fin'st thing in the morning... we'll make our way over to the police station, let them handle this.
That's what they get paid for.
This little secret. We don't have to tell her right now.
What do you think?
- Jesus Christ, Pepper!
- Ow!
We're in New York City.
That shit don't fly around here.
Whoa!
Would you please...
Just to come for a fitting.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah, you got any, uh, popsicles?
Popsicles.
No, sin'.
Well, I guess that'll be all, then.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That was wonderful.
- Well, shall we?
- Of course.
- Gentlemen.
- Margarette.
Sonny, take a gander at this.
Tell me what it says.
"Tuesday, 9 p. m. 50 Central
Park South. Top floor. "
"I must see you again.
Margarette. "
Whew. Well, kiss a duck's red ass.
I do believe she loves me.
I'll be right back.
That amazes me.
That truly amazes me.
I'm beginnin' to like this town, you know.
- Well, it's time to go.
- Hmm?
- Stop touching me, Pepper!
- Hey, get down.
- Them people think we skipped the check.
- They think right.
- Well, bullshit. Pay 'em.
- With what?
You lyin' son of a bitch.
You told me you still had some of that prize money left.
- I do. I wouldn't lie to you.
- Well, how much you got?
About eight bucks,
I reckon.
- "Eight bucks, I reckon. "
- Better than a poke in the eye, ain't it?
Pepper, I've had it with you.
Ah! Ooh!
Ah. Don't worry.
Things will get better.
Only when my father comes.
You have to face the fact that maybe your father isn't coming.
He is coming.
Back to work!
I said, back to work.
Where is my father?
- Let go of me!
- Juan!
Déjala quieta.
- Are you okay?
- No.
There's a sink in the other room.
Let's go in there and wash that off, all right?
We'll take care of this.
Come on.
Go ahead.
My father was going to take me to New Mexico... to work with him on the ranch.
Where is my father?
- Please tell me.
- I don't know.
I mean, that's the truth.
The last time...
The last time I talked to him, he was still trying to raise the money... to pay me for getting you outta Cuba.
He already paid you.
Yeah, he paid me. He paid me some.
I mean, he didn't pay me everything.
Please, sit down.
Your father's comin', Teresa.
I mean, I don't know what's keepin' him.
Until he comes, let me take you outta here.
These people can be very cruel, as you just saw.
They take advantage of a pretty girl any chance they get.
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.
What are you gentlemen doing here?
Just catchin' a few winks, officer.
For your information, there's a law... against camping in Central Park, and a fine.
I.D.'s, please.
Are you fellas cowboys?
No, we, uh, criminals, mostly.
You know, sleep out in parks.
- Bloodthin'sty shit like that.
- Pepper.
Excuse him, officer.
He wasrt raised with any manners.
- Where you guys from, Texas?
- Texas!
There ain't no real cowboys from Texas.
We're from New Mexico.
So what brings you guys to New York?
- Lookin' for a friend.
- A friend?
He came here about a week ago.
Havert heard from him since.
Thought we'd come check it out ourselves, you know?
Hey!
Yeah, hey. You better watch it.
She's liable to come up lame on you.
Oh.
Hey, uh, thanks.
Listen, uh, you guys been to
Missing Persons?
No, sin'.
Come on. I'll, uh,
I'll walk you over.
- Thank you very much.
- Maybe they know something.
Ho.
Almost forgot.
Next time you'll be a little more polite.
I always wanted to be a cowboy myself.
Ridin' the range.
Always wanted to ride the Chisholm Trail from end to end.
Of course, the only cow I've ever seen is over in the Central Park Zoo.
- Sign in, then I'll take you down to Missing Persons.
- Thank you very much.
Hey.
You, uh, you ever heard of Bill Pickett?
- What's that?
- Bill Pickett. He was a cowboy in the Old West.
He pretty much invented bulldogging.
Black man. Like me.
Who told you that?
- It's true.
- Hey.
Sonny, you hear that?
He thinks some old black cowboy invented bulldogging.
That'd be
Bill Pickett, Pepper.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Oh, you mean
William Pickett.
Yeah. Oh.
- Age?
- Fifty-five or so.
Social Security number?
I don't even know if he has one, ma'am.
Any tattoos or distinguishing marks?
He's got a small scar over his left eye.
Yeah, I remember that. One night he got toilet-huggin' drunk...
- Shut up, Pepper.
- Okay.
- That's our friend.
- Goddamn!
- I'm sorry.
- How did it happen?
They found him in the East River four days ago.
One shot in the head.
His thumbs were tied behind his back.
Oh, Jesus.
We found this in his shin't pocket.
It's a claim ticket from a pawn shop.
Listen, uh, let's go talk to the Chief.
There's nothing more you can do for him here.
Adiós, my old friend.
They place illegals into domestic work, prostitution, sweatshops.
There may be 3,000 sweatshops running in this city alone.
- Goddamn, that's slavery.
- Yeah.
A lot of big cities run on it, whether anybody wants to admit it or not.
What are you all gonna do about our friend's daughter, Teresa Salazar?
Look, Mr. Gilstrap, we'll do all we can to find your friend's daughter.
There's a procedure. Sam will have to file reports with the I.N.S., the Department of Labor.
It's gonna take time.
You have to be patient.
Damn, who's the law around here, Sam?
Look, I'm, uh, sorry
I couldn't do more.
I guess I'm no Bill Pickett.
Yeah, well, not much use for cowboys these days anyhow.
Look, I'll, uh, do what I can here.
I'll call you in New Mexico and keep you posted.
Thanks.
How we supposed to know what we're lookin' for when we see it?
Lookee there.
It's them two bastards from last night.
I don't remember seein' that other guy.
Neither do I, but he sure as hell looks like the boss to me.
I think we oughta see what we can find out about that guy.
Okay, I got it.
You go in there and talk to him.
I'll cover the truck.
That's real cowboy of you, Pepper.
I got a better idea.
Lemme go! Lemme go, lemme go, lemme go, lemme go! You bully!
Stink factory!
Hey! You settle down, you ornery little cuss.
Listen here. We wanna ask you some questions.
- What kinda questions?
- I wanna know about that guy drivin' that fancy car.
I don't know nobody in no fancy car.
Let's tie some rocks to the peckerwood and kick him in the river.
- Okay.
- You wouldn't do that to a veteran.
Hell, I'd do it just to see what it looked like.
So let me get this straight. These guys smuggle people.
Why? You got somebody you want smuggled outta someplace?
Answer the question.
Yeah, Huerta and Stark, they smuggle people... for a price.
- Who's the boss?
- Huerta's the boss, but Stark does all the legwork.
We got a friend that had somebody smuggle his daughter outta Cuba.
We were wonderin' maybe you could tell us where she is.
Now, why would I do that?
Hey, we're the ones askin' the questions here, bub.
- Why don't we throw him on the spit with the pigeon?
- Okay.
Wait, wait, wait! You just wanna know where your friend's daughter is, right?
That's right.
And we'll pay you.
- Write you a check.
- Don't take checks.
Twenty bucks.
You get the other half when you deliver.
Howdy, ma'am.
Hey. How ya doin'?
People so unfriendly here.
It's like talkin' to a bunch of rocks.
Get away from me!
- Pepper, behave yourself.
- He ain't gonna show.
- I only gave him half a twenty. He'll show.
- Hey! I'm gonna hit him.
- Pepper.
Hey, look.
Well, this towrs full of surprises.
- Did you have any luck?
- Gimme a smoke.
- There's your brand right there, pal.
- Easy, Pepper.
- You owe me half a twenty, cowboy.
- Yeah, well, earn it.
Your friend's daughter? Stark is keepin' her in a house over by the river.
Aha. I'm gonna give you the address.
I got a better idea.
Why don't you show us?
Okay.
Don't waste a lot of money on rent,
I'll say that for him.
- Which one is it?
- On the end there. 4-B.
- Okay, come on. - Oh, no, no, no. Uh, not me. Mm-mmm.
That's not part of the deal.
Where's my other half?
We'll give it to you when we get back, if she's still there.
She's there, all right.
Gentlemen.
Ohh!
I got 'em here for you,
Mr. Stark.
Just like you said.
You did a good job,
Pop Fly.
Can I get my money now,
Mr. Stark?
Teresa.
- Anybody home?
- Looks like she ain't here.
Come on, Pepper! Come on!
Kick this mule!
- Aah! Damn!
- You okay?
I'm all right!
I'm all right!
Oh, no.
You reckon somebody'll find him?
We ain't got time to worry about that now, Pepper. Come on.
Okay, we got a whole new plan.
- What's that?
- Let's get the hell out of here while we still got two nuts each.
Teresa's still out there, Pepper.
Goddamn it, don't go hardheaded on me.
There's nothin' we can do.
Those guys damn near killed us.
Let the police handle this.
They get paid to get shot at.
You always fade in the stretch, don't you, Pepper? Just like Vegas.
Boy, that rodeo again. You got a memory like a damned elephant.
I remember when a friend lets me down.
We were one steer away from the national championship...
- and you don't even show up.
- We won State, didn't we? Got the buckles to prove it.
It ain't about winnin' buckles, Pepper.
- It's about being able to count on a friend.
- It's just a damn rodeo.
It was more than a rodeo!
It was a down payment on my ranch!
I'd been dreamin' about that since we were wearin' short pants and ridin' stick horses.
But you don't care about other people's dreams.
You sure as hell don't care that Nacho died for his.
I don't see how lettin' some crazy bastard shoot our fuzzy asses off... is gonna bring Nacho back to life.
- Get out.
- What?
Get the hell out!
Sonny!
Taxi!
Asshole!
I didn't mean you, pardner.
Follow that red pickup.
I've come to pick up my guns, ma'am.
There. Right there.
Pull over.
That's four-fifty, please.
- Hey, you take a check?
- Take a check? Take a hike!
Four-fifty, please.
All right.
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Here. One, two.
Two-fifty, two fifty-five...
- That'd be all of them.
- $4,000 for the lot.
$4,000? These here are my guns, lady.
They are yours for 4,000 bucks.
- Well, look, I just need a couple of 'em.
- Teddy!
- I'll give you an I.O.U. It's the best I can do right now. - Good-bye!
You hear her?
She said good-bye.
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?
Don't do this?
I'll tell you one more time:
Don't push me again.
Ohh.
Not my personal best time, but it'll do.
Hey!
Yahoo.
Lady, look, how about a trade?
You like this belt buckle?
Solid silver and gold. Only two of 'em like this in the whole wide world.
- What is won'th?
- I don't know. It ain't won'th a damn thing to me no more.
Oh, Sonny, don't do that.
- Only two like it in the whole world?
- That's right.
Manny.
How you doin'?
Come on in.
Is the girl here?
Yeah, uh, she's upstain's.
Why?
- Go get her.
- Hey, wait a second. What are you doin'?
John... where's her father?
He came around looking for her.
This guy got out of control.
I'm not kidding you, Manny.
Out of control.
It was an accident, that's all.
Just an accident.
He could've screwed us.
I took care of it.
It was an "accident"?
He got out of control, huh?
Why? What did you do, huh?
Tried to get more money out of him, right, John?
Those cowboys the other day...
They were looking for him, werert they?
Huh?
It's being taken care of, Manny.
I can handle it.
The cowboys got away, John.
They're still out there.
So, what now, more killing?
Take her out.
You gonna kill her too?
- We are not in the killing business, goddamn it!
- There's another solution, Manny.
We sell her.
We can make a lot of money off a young girl like that.
A hell of a lot more than she's making for us in any sweatshop.
You have been doing a lot of figuring, haven't you, John?
- This will protect you! It's the smart thing to do!
- Shut up!
What we do with her is up to me, because you work for me!
And when the buying and selling that goes on behind my back... gets in the way... then it stops.
Why are you treatin' me like this, Manny?
Huh?
Why are you treatin' me like this, Manny?
- Where's Teresa?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know you've got her!
- Screw you, cowboy. I ain't talkin'.
Which one of you bastards killed her father?
No.
We wait for Stark.
I'll get the rope. We'll tie him up.
Ho! Hey! Ho!
Crazy sons of bitches.
Yeah.
Evenin', ladies.
Excuse me, sin'. This party is by invitation only.
- Invitation only, huh?
- Yes, sin'.
- What's that look like, Mac, a chicken fried steak?
- Please excuse me. Enter.
Uh-huh.
- Whoo!
Boy, a fella could get a terminal erection in here, couldn't he?
Speak for yourself.
Excuse me, can I take your hat, sin'?
Hell, no, you won't take my hat.
Here, take my bag.
- Thanks.
- Howdy, pardner.
- How you doin'?
- I'll be better if you got some mescal back there.
- Sure do.
- Mescal, 1993.
- I know it well.
- Thank you so much.
- Ho!
- Slow down there, amigo.
- Ah. Thank you.
- Much obliged.
- Have a good night.
- Howdy. Remember me?
- Oh. Sorry. You look just like my sister.
- But she ain't stuck up!
- Ho!
- Whoo! You're a bad boy, you know it?
- Hell, yeah, I know it.
I'm glad you came.
I was hoping you would, Mr...
- Lewis. Pepper Lewis.
- Pepper Lewis.
Wild horses couldn't have kept me away.
- So, this is your party, huh?
- Mmm. For a new client.
- What business you in?
- I own a modeling agency.
- Mmm.
- So these people are all clothing designers, manufacturers, distributors.
They're all here to see the new lines, the new models.
In fact, you see that gentleman standing right over there?
That's Alfonse Salini, the famous Italian designer.
No shit.
Hey, Al!
How's your hammer hangin', boy?
- Where's your friend?
- Sonny?
Oh. Well, we ain't as close as we used to be.
I decided to go my own way.
There's some people
I'd like you to meet.
Jacques. Gaston.
Pepper Lewis, meet my new friends, Jacques and Gaston.
- Hi.
- Howdy, boys. Pepper Lewis. How you doin'?
- Margarette, this is our cowboy?
- Oui.
- I love this cowboy.
- Look at this face.
Hey. You about to lose you a hand there, Pierre.
Margarette, did you hear that?
Ah, this cowboy...
Formidable.
- Didrt I tell you?
- Tell 'em what?
You know, I love him. I love the hat, the boots, the, how do you say...
- The attitude!
- Attitude! That's it! He is a man for all men!
Hey! Oh...
What the hell?
You a couple of rope suckers?
He is perfect!
Perfect!
Yes, I knew you'd be pleased.
Pepper!
Them's some wein'd ducks you got there, you know it?
- They want you to model for them.
- Model?
They design mers undergarments.
Check it out.
Let a bunch of people I don't even know see me gallivantin' around in my underwear?
Pays $500 an hour.
I can probably get you more.
I don't care if it pays a million dollars an hour. I wouldn't do it.
Well... if you change your mind, you've got my number.
- Well, now, hang on there, missy.
Hey! That ain't the way this party's supposed to end.
- Ooh.
- Let's dance.
- Yeah? To this?
- If it's got hain' on it, I can ride it.
If it's got a beat, I can dance to it. Hold that, Jean-Claude.
Take it off!
Take it off!
Take it off, cowboy!
Whoo!
- Take it off, baby!
- Yeah!
Sonny?
Sonny.
Teresa.
You know who I am.
My father sent me pictures of you in his letters.
He showed me everything you ever sent him too.
Practically watched you grow up.
Ohh.
Teresa...
I have to tell you about your father.
He, uh...
Shh.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.
They're too tight.
There's a knife under my jacket in my belt.
You ever done a shiver shot?
Well, this just happens to be your lucky day.
Pretty simple, really.
Just take this, put it right there.
- Put that... there.
- Hmm?
- Now you get the shiver.
- Mmm!
Mmmm!
Mmm.
And I... get the shot.
Ahhh!
I know you eat the worm.
Well... don't be shy.
Holy jumping Jesus.
You know that guy?
- John Stark?
- Yeah. He a friend of yours?
Not really.
He's a clothing manufacturer.
Clothing manufacturer, my patoot.
- Come on. Introduce him to me.
- Mmm!
- It's got a beautiful cut to it.
- Uh, excuse me. Pepper Lewis, John Stark.
I already know this son of a bitch.
- Oh, I didn't know this was a costume party.
This son of a bitch killed my friend
Nacho and kidnapped his daughter!
He's a slave trader, is what he i...
I think this guy's had a few too many to drink, huh?
Is that the best you got?
Even the old Cuban had better than that.
Now, you get this piece of shit out of my way! Get him out of here!
Oh, shit! Sonny!
Shaw!
- Hey, buddy, I thought you went home.
- Believe me, I want to.
- Loan me your horse, will ya?
- I don't loan my horse to anybody.
Sonny's in trouble.
Hop on.
Hyah!
Qué pasa, John?
- You don't look so good.
- Yeah, I don't feel so good either.
What's goin' on?
Don't you know?
- I thought you had everything under control.
- What are we gonna do, Manny?
Stand here all night playing games?
Malagradecido, carajo.
I took you in right out of prison and gave you everything you got.
And you never had to remind me of that, did you?
You got greedy.
You killed that old man for a lousy five grand.
You need me, Manny... because
I get things done.
The things that you ain't got the stomach for anymore.
What I haven't got the stomach for anymore is you, John.
So get the hell out of here.
You don't work for me anymore.
You're right.
I don't.
What makes you think... that you're so much better than me?
You got a problem with this?
I ain't got a problem.
- You got a problem?
- No. No.
How you doin', baby? Hmm?
I wanna talk to you for a second.
Let him go, Chango.
Come here.
You know, you never should've left the cow shit. Hmm?
[Ohh!
Okay, get the girl.
Let's get outta here.
What do you want me to do with the vaquero?
Him? Cut his throat.
Okay, cowboy... it's show time.
No!
What are you planning to do?
I let my friend down twice.
I ain't gonna do it again.
You're gonna get yourself killed!
We gotta call for backup.
- I thought you wanted to be a cowboy.
- Yeah, I do, but...
Well, mister, this is the cowboy way.
Wha-hoo!
Hold on! Don't move!
Where's my buddy?
Aah!
Whoa. Get over there where I can keep an eye on you.
You heard the man, shit for brains.
Where's his buddy?
Watch 'em.
I'm gonna go after Sonny.
You people stand back.
My partner's coming through.
All right, now, listen up.
I don't want any talkin', any lookin' around.
You're answering to the big man now... Mad Dog Shaw.
Say adiós, Cowboy.
A- day-os.
- About time, Pepper.
- Better late than never.
- They took Teresa.
- Took her where?
This son of a bitch here knows.
Move!
- Good work, Sam.
- Sure thing.
- Nice to see you, Sam.
- Come on, man, where you guys takin' me, man?
Thanks for your cooperation.
Drinks are on the house.
Hee-yah!
- You'd better tell us where she is.
- Screw you, buddy.
This son of a bitch ain't talkin', Sonny.
Yeah, well, maybe we oughta show him how Pancho Villa used to make guys talk.
- You might think this here's gonna be fun...
- I ain't tellin' you nothin'.
- Hell, for the fin'st three or four seconds it just might be.
Ooh-eee, fellas, lookit there!
You fellas found a big one.
I had hell pullin' him off his mama's tit.
- Hungry bugger, isn't he?
- Yep. Starvin'.
You hear that, asshole?
Screw you, I ain't talkin'.
What's a baby cow gonna do to me?
- Hey, uh... Oh, come on, man, what you doin'?
I am embarrassed.
Our friend here is not wearin' any underpants.
Oh! He sees it.
Damn! That hungry devil thinks your little weenie is his mama's tit!
Hey, wait a minute, man.
You guys can't do this.
I'll ask you one more time, asshole: Where's Teresa?
I ain't tellin' you shit.
It's your call, Stubby.
Let him go, Pepper.
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Damn, that looks like it hurts.
Round up a posse, boys!
Come on.
Let's take her down to the dock.
- Pepper.
- Yep.
You know, about that rodeo...
I want you to forget about it, okay?
You just got drunk, that's all.
It could've happened to anybody.
- You ain't mad at me no more?
- No, I ain't mad at you.
You were right.
It's just a damn rodeo.
Last night, I was gonna take all those guys on by myself.
I just couldn't do it without you.
The whole time I was sitting there, thinkin'...
"Goddamn it, Pepper oughta be here with me.
" Started getting mad at you all over again.
Then I realized I wasrt mad at you,
I was mad at myself.
'Cause you were right... there's just some things I can't do on my own.
And I hated you for that.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I think you're tryin' to say, deep down you're a chicken shit. Is that it?
No, Pepper, that ain't it.
Here's that warehouse, just like old Stubby said.
Pepper, just forget it, okay?
I'm sorry I even brought it up.
All I'm trying to say is I ain't mad at you 'cause you got drunk... and completely ruined my chances of getting that ranch.
- Sonny.
- What?
Listen, uh, actually, I, uh...
- I wasrt drunk.
- Huh?
At the rodeo, I wasrt...
I wasrt drunk, I was just... bein' selfish again, like always.
What are you talkin' about, Pepper?
I knew we was gonna win that night... ain't nobody could've beat us.
I guess that's why
I didn't show up.
Didrt want you to buy that ranch.
Guess I just always figured we were... better together than we were on our own.
Didrt want to split up the team.
Get what
I'm trying to say?
Yeah, I think so.
I think you're trying to say that deep down you're a chicken shit.
I knew you'd understand, old buddy.
You ready?
- You gotta show me how to do that someday.
- It'd be my pleasure.
- Lock it?
- Yeah.
What are you doin'?
- Nothin'.
- Put it away.
You cover me.
Jesus!
- Shut up!
- No!
Oh, no! No!
Okay, everybody, hold it right there!
Let the girl go!
Come on. Come on!
Shit.
Goddamn it!
Well, if it ain't
Bill Pickett.
Let's go! Come on, move!
Nice work, Sam.
Hey, thanks a lot, guys.
We're bringing the boat in now.
- How's Teresa?
- Boat's secure, sin'.
Son of a bitch!
Go! Go!
- We'll never catch that bastard.
- The hell we won't.
Shit!
Pepper, duck!
Son of a bitch!
Yee-hoo-hoo!
Yee-hah!
He turned right!
There!
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
You can't just leave it...
- Aah!
- Shit!
Hey!
They're not in the car!
They gotta be in the subway!
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Excuse me!
Thank you!
Excuse me! Thank you!
Police!
Police! Police!
There he is!
- Where's the train going?
- Brooklyn.
- Any way we can head it off?
- Head it off? It's a fucking train!
It'll come out on the Manattan Bridge... but we'll never make it through this traffic.
Hyah!
Yee-hah!
- Hey!
- Follow the river!
- I need to use your radio.
- They stole our horses!
Don't worry, they're good with horses.
10-13, 53rd and Lex.
We have a hostage situation.
10-4. All units, all units.
10-13, 53rd and Lex.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ho!
Police business!
I need your cab! Come on, out!
Thank you very much!
Hey, get a job, will ya?
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Ahh-hah! Hyah!
Go ahead. Sit down.
Move it!
Come on! Let's go!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Whoo!
Hyah!
Ho! Ho! Whoa!
- Come on! Come on!
- Hyah! Gidd'up!
- Whoa! Yee-Hoo!
- Hyah!
I need to know the fin'st train stop after the Manattan Bridge.
I need backup there now!
That would be the 62nd Street station.
Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah, hyah!
- Hyah!
Hyah!
Look, Mom!
Cowboys!
There he is!
- Hyah!
- Gidd'up, boy! Whoo!
Hyah!
- Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Pepper!
Come on!
- Jump!
- Okay!
Jump!
Aah!
Stop the train!
- I can't! This is the express!
- You stop this train now!
Coming through!
Excuse me, please!
Stark!
- We just want the girl!
- Yeah, and all I want is your guns!
Throw 'em down on the track.
Do it!
Do it!
Don't play games with me.
Give me the other one.
You cowboys.
You're a dyin' breed, man.
Aah!
Hold it right there!
Pepper, heel it!
Give it up, man.
There's nowhere to go.
- Shaw, are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Give him a hand.
- Take it slow, take it slow.
Thank you.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Nice throw.
- Not bad yourself.
Thank you.
Can't thank you enough, Sam.
Hey, my pleasure,
Sonny.
- Don't you forget you got an open invitation to come see us.
- Thanks.
- Pepper.
- Saw you in the paper this morning, Sam.
- Yeah?
- Good picture.
Put me in mind of William Pickett.
- How's that shoulder?
- Oh, it's, um...
Oh, it's, it's okay.
Well, this'll cure what ails you.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
How's your butt?
Tender subject, Sam.
Okay, off we go. Ho!
Teresa, you take care of these two.
I will.
So long, Sam.
Got a little somethin' here for you,
Sonny. Thought you might want it back.
Damn, Pepper.
How the hell'd you get the money to pay for this buckle?
There ain't no hill for a high stepper.
- You didn't give that old lady a bad check, did you?
- Hell, no!
Old bitch wouldn't take a check.
- So how'd you come up with the money?
- I ain't tellin'.
- Pepper!
- Nope. My secret.
You ain't gonna know, not in a million years.
- Pepper.
- Don't ask me. I'll go to my grave with it.
Where is Hudson Saanteek?
You have to leave.
You're not supposed to be here.
Not now.
- Please.
- Oh.
Don't buy yourself trouble.
I want the man that signed the claim.
Nobody has a claim.
This is a sacred place.
Ask him again, Smiley.
- Jesus, mountain's solid gold.
- So where is he?
Just leave us alone.
This is our grandfather.
We're saying our goodbyes.
There. I'll ask you again.
Where is Hudson Saanteek?
- What are you doing here? Get out!
- Hudson!
Don't let him get away.
- Where is he?
- Up there.
Come on, this way.
Kill the son of a bitch.
Over there.
Yeehaw!
Got him.
- You got him, huh?
- Yeah.
Let's get back to Nome.
I'll buy youse all a nice warm hooker.
Easy.
Papa?
Son.
- You've grown.
- You're home.
- Morning, Miss Sarah.
- Good morning.
- I'll take her, Miss Sarah.
- Thank you. 
- Mama.
- What is it?
Bjorn.
It's so good to see you.
Hannah.
Can you believe it?
What is it?
This winter, you'll have a room of your own.
Close your eyes.
Can you feel how warm? 
It's gold.
Sold, the Kosoktok mine... to this lucky man... for $250.
Next up, the North Star Falls.

One thousand dollars is the bid.
Going once.
Going twice.
Sold to Mr. Sean McLennon, new owner of the North Star claim.
I'm, uh, very sorry about that.
It seems I've edged you out by just a smidgen.
Mr. Hanson.
Bjorn, wait for us.
- Come on, hurry up.
- Come on, Jesper.
I want to claim a stake.
You mean, stake a claim?
Yes. That.
- Name?
- Bjorn Svenson.
Where's this claim at?
Here.
Proof of citizenship?
- I'm Swedish.
- I'm sorry, Mr., uh, "Svenson."
Unless you're an American citizen,
I have to deny your claim.
What? I-- I don't...
- What do you mean?
- According to the Miner's Association... foreigners can no longer stake claims on American land.
But it's my claim.
I've been digging for eight months.
That's why I came here.
I'm sorry, it's not my rule.
Give me my map.
I'm sorry, it is now the property of the North American Miner's Association.
- Give me my map.
- Mr. Svenson.
- Don't you jump my claim.
- Bjorn.
Hey. Hey. What's going on here?
They said, foreigners can't make claims here.
- They stole my map.
- Who?
- Who?
- He.
That's against the law.
We're only following
Miner's Association rules, Lindberg.
If you wanna complain, you know where to go.
All right, come on.
- Where's McLennon?
- Who?
- The owner, your boss.
- Oh, McLennon.
I haven't seen him.
Where's McLennon?
Yes? Gentlemen, can I help you?
How dare you deny these men their claims?
Oh, I see, you, um--
You think this is a claims office.
It's true. This is a bar.
This man was denied his claim because he was not a citizen.
After eight months of digging.
Do you think that's just?
Well, according to the
Miner's Association, yes, it is just.
You are the Miner's Association.
Yes, that's true. 
I am the president.
And as the president, it is my duty to inform you... we are about to a meeting which will declare all foreign claims...
- void and illegal.
- No, no, you can't do that.
You can't do this.
What's the matter with you?
What?
Without their claims these men will freeze to death on the beaches.
Nobody asked them to come to Nome.
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right. 
Move, go home.
No.
Have you seen a man freeze to death,
Mr. McLennon?
A frozen man, or the actual freezing process?
No, I don't.
Because the actual freezing process is quite something to see.
The body's natural instinct is to fall asleep... but, anyway... first, uh, the joints and the tendons contract into little knots... and then your extremities... you, know, your nose, your fingers, your sex organs... they get frostbitten and fall off.
Then your breathing shuts off and you asphyxiate, it's terrible.
Do you expect these men will stand by... and watch this happen to their wives and children, do you?
- I expect these men to go home.
- We ain't going home.
We are up front with you.
May the words of a fellow Scot--
I, of course, was born here.
But a Mr. Macbeth said:
"When our actions do not, our fears do make us traitors."
I have no fear to tell the truth... which is that I don't care if you people freeze to death.
Because as far as I am concerned, you're trespassing.
This is disgusting.
Damn you. How dare you?
You are stealing from the people to whom this country belongs.
So you see? 
It's either your lives or ours.
Well, that's not a hard decision to make, is it?
- You son of a bitch.
- Reno. Smiley.
No.
If you going to take my claim, you'll have to kill me like all the others.
And why not do it now?
Come on, get them out of here.
Get these guys out.
Get him.
Get out, now.
Hey, you, get up.
- Come on. You heard me.
- No, I didn't.
Here we go.
Goddamn. Goddamn, I'll kill you.
- Hey, hey, you.
- Get him out of here.
Get him, come on.
Get him out. Get him out.
McLennon. Go home.
- Go home.
- Just leave. 
You dogs.
Hey. Halt.
- What the hell's happening?
- These men are stealing from us.
They're thieves.
- Well, that's better.
- McLennon, what's happening here?
These foreigners came into my saloon and started tearing the place apart.
- Liar. You started this.
- Let's have some order here.
Order? You call this order?
- He's planning to take over all our claims.
- Take it easy.
He's starting a war.
- Look, I'll handle this.
- You will?
You may own the town, McLennon, but you don't own me.
We'll be back, McLennon.
Don't fight, Bjorn.
Come on. Come on, let's go. Go.
McLennon.
I'm gonna have to report this to Colonel Johnson.
A barroom brawl?
It seems like a local matter to me, but if it's a little too big for you, sheriff...
McLennon,
I'm not gonna have violence here.
These foreigners, they ain't gonna stand by and watch you wipe out their claims.
And between you and me,
Congress ain't gonna approve it either.
And there's talk about an audit of the Claims Office.
I'm sorry, Sean,
I gonna have to report this.
Well...
Sheriff, I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.
Reno, Smiley, come on, we got work to do.
You brought the white man here.
They killed my grandfather because of you.
I'm sorry.
But I had nothing to do with it.
- Why did you steal our cave?
- I didn't steal anything.
Why do they say it's yours then? Why?
- I claimed it to protect it.
- You claimed it for the gold.
As long as I have this, the cave is still yours.
We don't need you to protect what's ours.
You can't protect yourself from them.
I know these men. They crave gold.
To them, it's just another mountain.
Sooner or later, they would have come to find and destroy it.
And you are half of one of them.
And you will destroy us.
How do you know?
Besides... they think I'm dead.
Goodbye, uncle.
"Normann Olsen, deceased.
New owner, Sean McLennon.
Dominique Tropini, deceased.
New owner, Sean McLennon."
"Hudson Saanteek, deceased.
New owner...
Sean McLennon."
What the hell?
Damn.
What is it, Smiley?
We got a problem.
Not now.
A big problem.
- Sean, what the--?
- Big time gunfighter, huh?
- What do you want?
- Just some broken-down bum.
Get out.
Get out, now. Now.
He's dead, huh?
The guy's dead?
Hey, I saw the Indian. 
He's alive.
I bought that mine because I thought you could do something besides this.
Now, I'm in deep shit.
Deep shit.
I want that half-breed dead.
You're a bum.
I thought you shot him.
Hey, maybe I missed. I, uh--
Square piece of garbage.
My Sarah.
Read aloud.
"Make me a willow cabin at your gate... and call upon my soul within the house.
Write loyal cantons of contemned love... and sing them loud even in the dead of night."
Twelfth Night.
"Shout your name to the reverberate hills... and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out, "Olivia!"
O, you should not rest between the elements of the air and earth... but you should pity me."
No way he's still in town.
I'll go back and burn down the whole goddamn Indian village.
- Reno said to look out for him all night.
- Oh, Reno.
While he stays in bed.
Goddamn.
Goddamn, I killed that Indian.
You've gone too far, McLennon.
You want the cave?
Deal with me.
Leave the Indians alone.
You got that?
They have nothing to do with it.
It's just between you and me.
Get away from him.
Get out! Get out!
Reno! Quick!
Reno! Someone--
Quick, help!
Quick, someone's attacked Sean.
Stay here.
Help, Smiley, quick!
Help me, help! Get off.
- Don't move.
- Reno, please!
- Put your guns down, I'll kill her.
- Reno! Reno!
Let me go. Stop!
Get off me. They'll kill you.
Will you get off?
- What's going on?
- You gotta help me.
- What are you doing with her?
- What are you doing? That's my sled.
Help! Help!
- Stop, don't shoot!
- Sean, help!
No.
Sean!
Get the sleds ready and get the goddamn tracker.
- You mean, the Indian?
- Yeah, the Indian.
Make sure Sean's sled's ready.
- You forming a posse?
- No, going fishing.
Don't forget his rifle.
- Of course we're forming a posse.
- Any money in it?
You two help get the girl back...
I'll make sure you never look at another mine.
All right.
- You can't go alone.
- Hey, Annie. Annie, we're gonna be rich.
Stay down.
Please, someone help!
- Help, somebody, help!
- Shut up.
- Stop!
- Stay down.
- Hold on, McLennon.
- You're late, aren't you?
You know, a posse ain't legal without the law behind it.
Stay and do your job.
- Hyah, hyah, hyah.
- Hyah, hyah.
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm coming.
Halt! Stop!
Come back!
Smoke!
Come back!
Help! Help!
Where are you running to?
There's nowhere to go.
Give me your hand. 
Give me your hand.
I won't hurt you.
Hold on to me.
Go, go!
Come on! Hyah! Hyah!
Stop!
- Please, sir.
- Hey, hang on.
Please, hang on.
Oh, God. Please.
I'll take you to someplace warm.
What's going on?
The girl jumped out, she ran down there.
He brought her back, then continued.
- I can't wait to kill that Indian.
- He's not an Indian, he's a half-breed.
- What's the difference?
- Let's go.
- We don't want you here.
- Help me.
- You bring nothing but trouble.
- Leave me alone!
White man's trouble.
- Help me.
- You bring death. 
Don't worry, she'll take care of you.
White men.
- We have to go.
- Don't touch me.
If you stay here, they will kill everyone.
- Let's go, come on.
- Don't touch me.
Let's go.
Let me go.
- Come on.
- No, no!
- Quick.
- Yap-yap-yap.
- He says he didn't--
- I know what he said.
I can see it in his lying face.
Go look for tracks.
I found tracks.
We go while they're still fresh.
Hey, wake up.
Wake up!
Stop!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Don't sleep. 
Wake up, wake up! Hyah!
Hyah, yap-yap, yap-yap.
I just hate this goddamn snow.
Christ.
You mean all this time we've been chasing an empty sled?
He's been dragging us along behind a goddamn empty sled.
I should have known, you goddamn Indian.
What are you trying to do, kill us?
- I'll kill him, I'Il--
- Smiley, take it easy.
Come on.
No, we shouldn't trust him.
I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch.
I'm gonna shoot his red ass off.
You're gonna shoot him, eh?
The same way you shot the half-breed?
Come on, Reno. 
He's just an Indian.
Go ahead, half-wit.
I bet he drops you right here.
I thought we were business partners,
I thought we were friends.
Friends? You shitbreath.
I'll kill you for that, Reno.
- I'll kill you for that.
- So shoot, goddamn it.
Shoot! You killed the half-breed, we wouldn't be here.
Go ahead, shoot everybody.
I'm looking forward to hell.
He's just an Indian.
What's wrong with you?
He's just an Indian.
Goddamn it. Goddamn them.
Goddamn that dog.
Goddamn that dog.
- Goddamn Indian.
- He's crazy.
I'll kill them. Everything.
Goddamn.
Goddamn.
Nobody dies until I tell them to die.
You should eat.
Please?
- I didn't mean to harm anyone.
- Well, you did.
I had no choice.
They were trying to kill me.
- You tried to kill Sean.
- No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
I tried to talk to him.
With a knife to his throat?
I told him to stay away from the North Star.
The North Star?
Well, that's his.
- It doesn't belong to him.
- Yes, it does. He bought it.
Because the owner died?
Exactly.
Well, I am the owner.
Do I look dead to you?
The North Star belongs to those Indians... who gave you warm clothing when you were freezing.
I filed a claim to protect them from McLennon.
I'm Henry Pruett Johnson.
Colonel of the United States Army,
Fort Michael.
Military commander for the territory of Alaska.
As of this moment, the town of Nome is under martial law.
So you see, it's not that simple.
- I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.
- What?
I mean, Sean isn't like that.
He cares for me.
He's not what you think.
You haven't listened to anything.
You don't understand why I'm doing this.
No, you're right, I don't.
- I don't think you're being honest.
- Honest?
What do you know about me?
You just think of me as a half-breed and a thief.
No, I don't.
I mean, what are you hoping to prove from all this?
That cave is sacred, like a church.
And McLennon's men defiled it.
They killed an old man who was like a father to me.
And I could do nothing to stop them.
That man had my respect... because he taught me as a child about right and wrong.
And if I can save that cave... then I can be honest with myself about who I am.
What are you gonna do?
- Look, I'll talk to Sean--
- Sean, he'll be here sooner or later.
And do his best to kill me.
Do you understand that?
You don't know him.
Look, he'll listen to me.
Why are you trying to help me?
You could have let me die out there and you didn't.
We'll leave tomorrow.
Before they get here.
Where to?
Nome.
Sean McLennon, owns 10, now 11 of the richest strikes on Anvil Creek... and he didn't file the original claim on one of them.
Nothing wrong with transferring a claim.
Happens all the time.
The original owners of McLennon's transfers are all dead.
Here. And here.
Here, this Indian.
Eyewitnesses saw him alive, here in town.
That makes things a little more slippery now, doesn't it?
I'd say a lot more.
Well, you best find him, and the girl.
- Well, now, this matter really--
- Sheriff.
Take three of my men and go after that posse.
Inform them of the martial law decree.
And order them to return to Nome immediately.
- Get up, get up.
- Hmm?
- Why?
- Get dressed, they're here.
No!
Sean.
Sean, listen. 
You have to listen to me.
You have to--
- Kill him.
- No!
No!
Tell them to stop, please.
No, Sean, you can't.
You mustn't shoot him.
No, Sean, please.
Stop it! Stop, stop shooting.
Please, please, stop it!
Out of the way.
Blow him up.
Sean, please. 
He didn't mean any harm.
He just wants to talk to you.
He told me.
What are you wearing?
What did you do with him?
You fucking whore. You whore!
I don't know what you're thinking.
How can you say that to me?
Gwill! Gwill!
Oh, no. Jesus Christ.
He's getting away.
Kill him! Put the dogs on him.
Please, please, Sean. I don't know what's wrong with you. Please, please.
Please. Please, Sean, just take me back to Nome, please.
Please, Sean.
Just take me back to Nome, please.
- Take me back to Nome, please.
- Let me take her back.
Please.
What?
I'll take her back. 
She'll freeze out here.
I mean, I gotta take
Gwill's body back, anyway.
I mean, a posse ain't no place for a woman.
All right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's great.
Why don--
Why don't you take her back to your sled and you keep her--
You keep her warm.
Maybe you like to fuck her like that half-breed, would you like that?
Let's finish what we came to do.
You're right.
Run.
Run out there to die or I'll kill you here?
I didn't come out here to kill any woman.
- Hey, what's that over there?
- That's a hell of a fire.
It's one of McLennon's boys.
Somebody shot him in the back of the head.
- How old you think this fire is?
- A couple hours at most. 
Whoever did this, sergeant, can't be far.
Come on. Hyah! 
Wait!
Wait, please! Stop!
Hyah.
Hyah.
Go on.
Go on, come on.
Go on.
We'll leave the horses here, follow up on foot.
That bastard.
That bastard.
It goes to the end of the canyon.
Well, that's good.
That's the only way out.
Let's get there first.
Ah. McLennon.
Well, well, Lamont.
What a pleasant surprise to find you out here like this... in the middle of all this natural beauty.
Boys?
What happened back there at the cabin?
You found old Pete, huh?
Goddamn half-breed, he shot him right in the face.
The half-breed shot him in the face?
He, um...
He ran out and old Pete went to grab him, and bang, right in the face.
Where's Sarah?
Sarah, well...
We're out looking for them now.
McLennon, Nome is under martial law right now.
Martial law, is that right? 
- Yup.
- Really?
Ah. Well, well, well.
Well, we'll be getting back there as soon as we find them.
Seeing as how you boys will all be there... seeing that it's nice and safe and martial and all.
I'm sorry, McLennon, but I'm taking over from here.
And I'm ordering you and your men to go back to Nome.
You just tell us which direction the half-breed went.
- I'd rather not.
- No, I'm the law around here, McLennon.
Not you.
Yeah, Lamont.
You're right. You are the law.
The man is right, he is the law.
- Look out!
- Hey, what the hell? 
- Please.
- All right.
Let's get to the dogs.
What is it, Tonga?
Very good.
You can see things, track, command dogs.
Speak English.
You understand what I say.
You didn't need me here.
You're a half-breed, just like him, aren't you?
Who was it, your mother?
Your father?
I won't tell anyone.
No, you won't.
- Afraid of a wolf?
- No.
But that half-breed's watching us.
That half-breed killed him.
- That's right, that half-breed killed him.
- Smiley, get the dogs ready.
Smiley, get the dogs ready.
You killed him, didn't you?
I just said the half-breed killed him.
- You saw him?
- Yeah, sure.
Oh, something's funny in there, Sean.
Where'd you think you were taking us?
- What, are you starting to question me?
- It's time I go back.
Half the mine is yours. 
You put your feet up for the rest of your life.
Don't you think that's a little late?
I'm going home.
Don't ever touch me again.
I'm coming apart.
You can't leave without me, you know.
You're the only friend I got.
You gotta trust me.
We'll go.
And in deciding this issue... the Miner's Association declares all foreign claims void and illegal... and open to restaking by the citizens of this frontier gem we call Nome.
Americans. God's children.
And in so doing, we rid ourselves of these scavengers... that have cost me so very much.
The life... of a woman that I loved very deeply.
Killed by a savage.
And the lives of my trusted friends... who bravely tried to help me save her.
And here in Nome, your oasis... among you, right here, there are savages.
Some are red, some are harder to spot.
But they all want the same thing, and you know what that is, don't you?
What do you have that they want?
And when will they try to take it?
Maybe tonight.
Maybe next week... maybe next month, but one night, when you're sleeping... they'll come take what's yours, because you're alone.
But from this day forward, you are not alone.
We are not alone.
Macbeth said:
"When our actions do not... our fears, we will fight against..."
- What?
- Sean McLennon.
You're under arrest for the murder of Sheriff Lamont...
Deputies Ross and Graves... and three soldiers of the United States Army.
- What are you talking about?
- We have an eyewitness.
The Indians saved her life and brought her here.
Take him away.
Citizens of Nome.
Citizens of Nome.
People of Nome.
I'm also here to inform you that meetings such as these... with obvious intent to cause disorder...
It's all over.
- Thank you.
- Get yourself some rest.
Congress has declared that all claims, past, present and future... by all miners, American and foreign, will be honored.
- Can I have my own room now?
- Of course you can.
You can have anything you want.
- Where is McLennon?
- He's in jail.
I wanted to say goodbye.
So did I.
- What's going on here?
- Haven't you heard?
The whole bloody beach is covered with gold.
My ancestors taught me you cannot own the land...
you can only respect it.
This is what I fought for.
And what I will always believe.
What's this war in the heart of nature?
Why does nature vie with itself?
The land contend with the sea?
Is there an avenging power in nature?
Not one power, but two?
I remember my mother when she was dying.
She looked all shrunk up and gray.
I asked her if she was afraid.
She just shook her head.
I was afraid to touch the death
I seen in her.
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or uplifting... about her going back to God.
I heard people talk about immortality.
But I ain't seen it.
I wondered how it'd be when I died.
What it'd be like to know that this breath now... was the last one you was ever gonna draw.
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did... with the same calm.
'Cause that's where it's hidden... the immortality I hadn't seen.
Kids around here never fight.
Sometimes.
Sometimes when you see them playing.
They always fight.
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.
- Why?
- 'Cause you look...
You look as an army.
- I look army.
- Yes.
Well, that don't matter.
It doesn't matter.
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.
Okay.
There you go.
Go, go, go, go. Go.
Go, go, go. Go!
Witt, patrol boat.
She's American.
What's it doing out here all alone?
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?
You haven't learned a thing.
All a man has to do is leave it to you, you put your head in the noose for him.
How many times you been AWOL?
You been in the army, what, six years now?
Ain't it about time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?
I mean, if you're ever gonna.
We can't all be smart.
No, we can't. That's a shame.
Look at you.
Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.
You'll never be a real soldier.
Not in God's world.
This is C Company, of which I'm first sergeant.
I run this outfit.
Now, Captain Staros, he's the C.O., but I'm the guy that runs it.
Nobody's gonna foul that up.
You're just another mouth for me to feed.
Normally you'd be court-martialed.
But I worked a deal for ya.
You oughta consider yourself lucky.
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.
You'll be a stretcher bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.
I can take anything you dish out.
I'm twice the man you are.
In this world... a man himself... is nothin'.
And there ain't no world but this one.
You're wrong there, Top.
I seen another world.
Sometimes I think it was just my imagination.
Well... then you've seen things I never will.
We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.
In a situation like that, all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.
Look out for himself.
I might be the best friend you ever had.
You don't even know it.
He hates you worse than poison.
I never felt he hated me.
'Cause I don't hate him.
I love Charlie Company.
They're my people.
They call it "The Rock."
Now, nobody wants this island.
The Japs just put an airfield there.
All the fighting's confined to this area.
As you can see, this is their road to Australia... and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.
Now, if we're gonna stop the Japs' advance... into the South Pacific, we've got to do it right there.
The marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.
Worked my ass off.
Brown-nosed the generals.
Degraded myself... for them, for my family... my home.
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.
Most men your age would have retired by now.
It's okay.
We need general officers with maturity and character like you.
We've got good sergeants.
We've got good lieutenant colonels.
But once a man gets those eagles...
He can't wait to get that star.
Can he? He becomes a politician, right?
Goes along to get along.
So goddamn hard to stay upright.
- You said it there, sir.
- With the admiral watching, which he will be.
There's always someone watching you.
Like a hawk.
Always someone ready to jump in if you're not.
Do you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Good.
'Cause we don't want our sons or our grandsons... fighting this war
30 years from now, do we?
- No, sir. We sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.
You... You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.
Yes, sir.
Do you wonder why... why did they...
Why did the Japs put an airfield there, of all places?
I guess we don't know the bigger picture though, do we?
If there is such a thing.
What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never asked myself that question.
- Mmm.
You're a humble man.
Nobody wants that island, but you.
How much do you want it?
As much as I have to, sir.
All they sacrificed for me... poured out like water on the ground.
All I might have given for love's sake.
Too late.
Dyin'... slow as a tree.
You feel it?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Take topside to the signal bridge.
The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.
I just can't help how damn scared I am, Sarge, all right?
I just can't help how damn scared I am, Sarge, all right?
I can't help it. I got...
You know, my stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little.
And I... I was scared.
And I used to run. I used to hide.
Hell, I slept in a chicken coop a whole lot of nights.
And...
I never thought it'd get no worse than that.
But I'm living by the... by the minute over here.
I'm counting the seconds.
- Yeah.
- And we're gonna be landing...
We're gonna be landing soon.
There's gonna be air raids.
We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.
- What's your name, kid?
- I want to own an automobile when I get out.
- What's your name?
- Edward... Edward B. Train.
Train.
The only things that are permanent is... is dying and the Lord.
That's it.
That's all you got to worry about.
This war ain't...
This war ain't gonna be the end of me.
- And it ain't gonna be the end of you neither.
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
How in the hell should I know?
All's I know is them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time they made this run.
On the other hand, time before last, they nearly got blew up.
- What do you want me to tell you?
- You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.
Tell you something.
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these here boats.
- That's what.
- I already know that.
Well, brood on it, Tills.
Brood on it.
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- Ain't interested.
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested even if it wasn't.
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.
- Yeah? Well, have fun.
- Yeah, have fun.
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore... and run into some of them samurai sabers.
Open this door!
Open this goddamn door!
Open the door!
I learned to deal these cards before...
All right. Here I am sleeping.
Yeah.
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?
- All right, jacks high, jack bet.
- Robert's got two jacks.
I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army... back in the Bronx before the war.
How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war?
Answer me that.
All I know is old Charlie Company's always gettin' screwed. Always.
And I can tell you whose fault it is too.
It's that captain of ours.
First he gets us stuck off on this boat, clear away from our own outfit... where we don't know a fucking soul.
Then he gets us stuck way down...
Hello, Captain.
Read in your 201 file you were an officer before the war.
How'd you end up a private?
'Cause of my wife.
I was in the Corps of Engineers.
We'd never been separated before.
Not even for a night.
I...I took it for four months... and then I quit.
Just resigned.
Th-They... They sent me back to the States.
They told me I'd never get another commission.
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.
Sons of bitches.
No, I don't blame them.
Well, where is she now?
She's home.
Why should I be afraid to die?
I belong to you.
Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!
Move, move! Movin' out!
If I go first, I'll wait for you there... on the other side of the dark waters.
Put your helmet on.
Be with me now.
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
I like you, Captain.
And I just want you to know... well, we're in this thing together. All right?
You keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
- I'll catch up with you there.
- Yes, sir.
It's all yours, Captain. Gangway!
Gangway, there! Coming through!
Squad leaders! Both teams!
This way, son. This way.
Right here.
Stand by to go inside!
Our Father who art in heaven...
- And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
- Okay.
For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory.
Your outfit's lucky.
Transports must've been spotted.
You're getting out of here just ahead of time. You're lucky.
Ho! Ho! Ho! Take a breath, mister!
You gotta breathe!
- Are you Charlie Company?
- Yeah.
We went in about a mile, sir.
There ain't nothing there.
Some oil drums, a burned-out spot.
There'd be nothing there for at least...
- About a week.
- About a week, sir.
But we didn't spot any casualties.
Japs must have hauled ass.
Couple of mortars hit the beach, but most of the guys came in standing up.
Darnedest thing I ever did see, sir.
They got fish that live in trees.
Oh, if they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?
Who are you who live in all these many forms?
Your death that captures all.
You too are the source of all that's gonna be born.
Your glory... mercy... peace... truth.
You give calm a spirit... understanding... courage.
The contented heart.
- Blankets.
- We need a medic now!
Maybe all men got one big soul... who everybody's a part of.
All faces of the same man.
One big self.
Everyone looking for salvation by himself... each like a coal... drawn from the fire.
We're going straight up that hill there.
We can't do that, Colonel.
Well, there's no way to outflank 'em.
Now, on the left there's a cliff that falls straight down into the river.
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.
What about water, sir?
Water's not getting up here.
My men are... passing out, sir.
Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitchin'.
We're all gonna attack abreast,
3rd platoon in reserve.
We've got to cross those three folds of ground. You see?
Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it... so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.
- Whyte?
- Yeah?
- You see those grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.
When you get to the end of that field... you're to locate and eliminate all the hidden strong points on those ridges.
I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.
Are you here?
Let me not betray you.
Let me not betray my men.
In you, I place my trust.
Eos Rotodoctolos...
Rosy-fingered dawn.
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?
Did you ever read Homer?
We read Homer at the Point.
In Greek.
What kind of artillery support do we have, sir? Over.
Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent in that position. Over.
- No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.
Okay, you guys. This is it.
We're going down in groups of 10.
There's no point in going by in rushes.
We'll only make a better target stopped.
Run all the way.
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale... you go organize them guys that's up there.
Movin' out in five minutes.
Let's go.
Sico, what's wrong with you?
I'm sick to my stomach.
Sico, you get up right now, or I'll kick you so hard in the stomach...
- you're gonna be sick.
- I can't, Sergeant. I would if I could.
I'm... I'm sick.
- I'm sick.
- You ain't sick. Get up!
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.
It's my stomach.
I'm in pain. I got cramps.
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.
- Come on. Get up.
- Leave him.
I need a volunteer to carry the B.A.R. Drop your gear, Sico.
I'm taking you to the medics.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Don't argue with me.
Good luck, Keck.
Plug that hole on your right.
Move!
- Maybe they pulled out.
- Mm-mmm.
Hit dirt! Hit dirt!
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
Stretcher bearers!
Move it out! Move out!
Come on!
- Stretcher bearers, this way!
- Come on!
Go get that man!
We already got eight or nine down there.
We're not supposed to...
Don't argue with me!
I'm Captain Staros. Go get that man.
Jim, he's not the one we should be thinking about.
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?
Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
We got others that are hit bad, sir.
That was all I meant.
- I gave you an order, Private!
- Yes, sir!
Hello, First Sergeant.
Who we going after over here?
We think it's Jacques.
Jockey?
Well, shoot.
That's... That's... That's too bad.
Sir? Sir.
Sir, can I come back to the company after we get Jockey back to the battalion?
- Okay. But you gotta get permission.
- Sure.
- All right.
- And my rifle.
Get up, Nicky!
You're still alive!
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Magnificent, Staros! Magnificent!
The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!
Beautifully conceived! Beautifully executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.
Young Whyte led beautifully.
- Yes, sir. Over.
- But sending in your second too was brilliant.
Just brilliant! They might well have carried the ridge with luck.
I don't think they were hurt too bad.
Blane led well too.
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?
Did they knock any out?
We oughta have those ridges cleaned out by noon! Over.
Hello? Hello?
Staros, are you there?
Here, sir. Over.
I said, how many emplacements did they locate?
Did they knock any out? Over.
Children.
I don't know, sir.
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over!
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.
I want you to get up there and see what the situation is.
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.
Now, goddamn it, the admiral got up at dawn for this!
Come to life down there, Staros! Out!
Move up!
Hey, Keck!
Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.
Blane's dead.
You're in charge.
We know you there, Yank.
Tojo eats shit!
No! Roosevelt eats shit!
I got him! I got him!
I killed a man.
Hey, Queen!
Queen, you there?
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.
Queen! You see them Japs leaving that left ridge?
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- No, I ain't seen much of nothing.
Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!
I'm serious!
I counted seven Japs leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!
I got me one of 'em!
- So?
- I think maybe they're pulling out!
Maybe somebody oughta go tell the captain!
Well, you wanna be the one to do it?
You just stay put!
I'm ordering you!
Stay down!
Stay low.
Go! Go! Go, go!
What do we do now?
We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.
To do what?
To capture some of these goddamn fucking positions around here! What do you think?
- You mean you really want to go on with this?
- I don't know.
No. No. Not no uphill charge, but... if they send us up some reinforcements, maybe we could... scout around and locate these machine guns.
Anyway, it's better than going back down through that.
- You wanna go back down?
- Something's coming. They're coming.
What are they doin'?
If they wanna throw us out of here... why... why didn't they come in force?
Maybe they was acting on their own.
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.
They're coming.
Keck!
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus!
I blew my butt off!
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!
Lay down!
- What a fucking recruit trick to pull!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
I grabbed it by the pin!
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.
Nobody's gonna have to write your old lady.
You're gonna make it.
- Don't you bullshit me!
- Stay down!
Hey, hey.
I got mud on my face.
Wipe it off.
Get it off. No!
I'll write her. I promise.
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.
Maybe it's for the best.
I'm all messed up down there.
I can't...
I can't fuck no more.
Wha...
Where am I?
Where am I?
You're gonna be all right.
Even if you die.
You didn't let your brother down.
Hey, if you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd have all been killed.
I'm gettin' cold.
I'm cold.
I'm freezing.
You gonna write his wife?
Fuck, no.
I don't know his old lady.
That's the company commander's job.
That ain't mine. You out of your mind?
- I ain't... I ain't no good at writing no letters.
- You told him you would.
I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.
- Somebody ought to do it.
- Well, then you write her. You write her.
What's wrong, Jim?
- Aaah!
- There's nothing anybody can do for him.
He'll be dead before they can ever get him back to a surgeon.
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Well, maybe it's worth a try.
At least I could get a syrette of morphine into him.
Would it keep him quiet?
Not for long.
But I could give him two.
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?
That's what you are.
That's all there is for us.
That's us. That's us.
I lost all 12. I lost all 12.
All 12 of 'em.
It's insanity up there.
I told 'em what to do. I showed 'em where to go, and I gave 'em a push.
Come on! Somebody help!
I know you. I know you. I know you.
- Sergeant, it's insane.
- I don't know who's in charge.
- I don't know who's in charge! But don't let him go!
- All right.
- Don't let him go! I'm outta here. I'm outta here.
- Take him back.
- Let me hold your rifle.
- I'm outta of here. All right. Move, feet, move.
Move, move, move.
Move! Move! I'm moving.
I'm moving. I'm moving now.
Please, don't touch.
Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. Okay, I'm outta here.
Come on. My feet are all right.
All right.
Somebody help me! Help me!
How goes it, kid? You gotta be quiet!
I came to help you, Tella.
Okay, calm down.
Fuck you! I'm dying!
I'm dying, Sarge!
Okay. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!
- Are you gonna get me out of here?
- I'm gonna take you back.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Put me down! Put me down!
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
Please, leave me alone.
Give me more. Give me more.
Give me more.
Give me more. Give me more.
Give me more.
- Okay.
- Give me more.
- Give me more.
- Here, Tella.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
Bye, kid.
Bye, Sarge. Good-bye.
Well, f-fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.
I want you to know I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow.
I'm gonna recommend you for the Silver Star.
- That's the most courageous thing...
- Captain.
Captain, if you say one more word to thank me, I'm gonna knock you right in the teeth.
You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign my rating so fast... and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.
You understand?
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.
What the hell's the matter with you, Staros?
Those men should be reinforced immediately!
What the hell are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses!
They're just lying there behind that ledge!
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over.
I don't think you understand what's going on down here, sir.
We've had heavy casualties.
We had a man...
His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir.
It created quite an upset.
Fine, fine.
Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.
I have two squads to...
First platoon I can send up, sir. Over.
What the hell do you mean, two squads?
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements, goddamn it, I mean it!
You commit everybody you have there and do it right now! Everybody!
Your first platoon too. I see 'em lying down there on their fat asses doing nothing.
You get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack!
And you move 'em by the flank to the ridge!
Then you get that second platoon... you move 'em over to the hill!
Have 'em press the center.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!
You attack them right now!
Jesus Christ, Staros! Do I have to give you a 10-cent lesson on infantry tactics... while your men are getting their asses shot off?
Colonel, I don't think that you fully understand what is going on down here.
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much firepower.
Colonel, there's a... there's a bunker up there.
We can't see it, and it's - it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.
I formally request to be given permission for patrol reconnaissance around... to the right of Hill 210 through the jungle.
I believe the entire position, sir, can be outflanked with a maneuver there in force.
- No!
- It might save lives.
Goddamn it, I tell you no!
There will be no flanking move!
- Now listen to me, Staros.
- Damn!
You're not gonna take your men around into the jungle... to avoid a goddamn fight!
Now do you hear me, Staros?
I want you to attack.
I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal.
Now attack, Staros!
That's a direct order!
Come on!
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.
The time, sir... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.
I've got two witnesses here listening to what I've said.
I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.
Staros, don't you pull this guardhouse lawyer bullshit with me!
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law!
This is a war! It's a goddamn battle!
Now, I want that frontal attack!
I repeat my order! Over!
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.
It's suicide, sir.
I've lived with these men, sir... for two-and-a-half years, and I will not order them all to their deaths.
Over.
This is a very important decision you're making, Staros.
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason.
- So I'm coming down there.
- Take a look.
Now, I'm not rescinding my order to you, son.
But if I find there are extenuating circumstances when I get down there...
I'm gonna take that into account.
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there!
And if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.
One spot's as good as another, men.
There's no place to hide.
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Where's... Where's Fife?
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.
Hold my hand, Fife.
Hold my hand.
I got it.
Oh.
I'm dying, Fife.
Oh, Captain.
Shut up in a tomb.
Can't lift the lid.
Played a role I never conceived.
Get that blouse on, soldier!
It's not a goddamn bathing beach.
Yeah, right here.
Put it on right now.
What are you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches!
Move up!
What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?
Observing, sir. Just sent 1st platoon forward to the ridge, sir.
- How many of 'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.
None? Not one?
That doesn't sound much like the situation you described to me over the sound power.
Well, it's not, sir. The situation's changed, sir, just in the last five minutes, sir.
Captain, you listen to me.
Now, we're going over there, and we're taking everybody with us.
Now, do you have any more formal complaints or demurrers?
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right, goddamn it!
We're gonna do things my way! My way!
You understand that, Captain?
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.
Show me how to see things the way you do.
Show me how to see things the way you do.
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.
Bell, take six men... and go see what's up there.
And we'll cover you best we can from down here.
Okay. You guys... You guys stay here.
Okay?
I'm goin' up alone.
Come out.
Come out where I am.
There was a...
There's a bunker up there.
It's five guns. It's five guns.
That strongpoint up there... somewhere up there around those rocks... is the key to this ridge.
Bell here is quite right.
From their knob up there, those goddamn little brown brothers... can cover the whole of the ground in front of this position for a thousand yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.
All right. All right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted.
And we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.
For that I'm sorry.
I apologize to you all.
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.
So I'm asking for volunteers.
Go back up there and knock it out.
Sir?
I'll be glad to... to go back up and lead the way back for a party.
- All right, Bell.
- I'll go, Colonel, sir.
And you. All right.
I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
I'd like that very much, sir.
All right, John.
I was hoping you'd say that.
- Go ahead. You'll be in command.
- All right. I'll go, sir.
- All right, you.
- Sir.
You.
All right, men. That's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.
I don't know if you realize the importance of this operation, Staros.
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.
That means air power for a thousand miles in every direction.
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.
It'll cost lives, Staros.
- Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.
Now, I explained to you the importance of this objective.
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?
I can't say, sir.
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?
How many?
One? Two?
Twenty?
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.
No, sir. You're right.
About everything you said.
Fine. Fine.
That's all, Captain.
One more thing, Staros.
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.
Ever.
We'll assume it.
Dismissed.
I feel sorry for you, kid.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.
This army's gonna kill you.
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do for anybody else.
Just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.
What difference you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.
If you die, it's gonna be for nothin'.
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be okay.
There's just this one.
Just this rock.
Go ahead. Come on.
Who's deciding who's gonna live?
Who's deciding who's gonna die?
This is futile!
Look at me.
I stand right up here and not one bullet!
Not one shot!
Why?
How come they all had to die?
I can stand right here. I can stand right up, and nothing happens to me!
We.
We together.
One being.
Flow together like water... till I can't tell you from me.
I drink you.
Now.
Now.
You're my light.
My guide.
John, we'll be right behind you.
If you can break through, we'll come pouring after.
We'll charge at your whistle signal.
All right, let's go, men.
Go get 'em.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Okay.
Stay down, below this ledge... and I'll call down the data from above.
Once the 81 s have plastered that rock as much as possible... we're gonna crawl along the big rock for cover... and then flank them to the right.
Okay?
Okay. Okay.
Azimuth 1-4-7-0... from Easy Roger Seven.
100 left. Add 200.
Uncle Baker One, fire mission.
Azimuth 1-4-7-0 from Easy Roger Seven.
Left 100. Add 200.
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.
Understand.
1-4-7-0 from Easy Roger Seven.
Left 25, drop 50.
Left 25, Uncle Baker One.
Left 25, drop 50.
Fire for effect. Over.
Roger, Uncle Baker One. 1-4-7...
Let's go!
Okay, we're gonna continue on up the hill to the right.
Nobody fire or throw their grenades till I give the signal.
Okay, let's do it.
Is he okay?
- Is he all right?
- What do you want to do now, sir?
- We can't take him with us.
- No, we can't leave him here!
Shut up. He's from your platoon.
You stay with him.
We can leave him and pick him up on the way back if he's still alive.
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!
We're pinned down!
Fall back!
Go!
Move back!
Look out!
Watch out!
Clear!
Clear!
Come on! Get down!
Come on. Get out of there.
Come on.
Want to kill soldiers?
You piece of shit?
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
You all right?
I shot a man.
Stinks around here.
All these dead people.
Put a cigarette up your nose.
Fire in the hole!
Look at 'em move!
Look at 'em move!
We got 'em on the run!
Way to go, John!
When they saw you make that attack and win, it was like you'd put their hearts right back in 'em.
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't do that, soldier!
Take good care of the others, men.
G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around before long.
I think we've wasted enough time here.
Let's go!
Sir, I've got a few recommendations for decorations I'd like to turn in to you.
Yes, yes, John. We're gonna get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.
In the meantime, I want you to know that I'm personally recommending you for something, John.
- Perhaps the big one.
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel I deserve it.
Oh, yes, you do, John.
Yes, you do.
Getting it for you, now, that's gonna be the goddamn problem.
But, hell, it would just be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment too if you did get it.
Now, we better get moving out of here.
We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.
Would you like to take command of Baker Company over on the left?
Of course.
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket or anything like that, but about the water...
- If we don't get some water to these...
- Don't worry about water.
John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours, now that we have the momentum.
We'll have some water in a couple of hours.
I've arranged for that.
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.
No, sir.
That's right.
And if some of the men... pass out... why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.
All right.
They could...
You know they could die from it.
Well, they could die from enemy fire too!
They're all tough boys.
Come on, men, let's go!
You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken right now.
All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill.
We'll have this hill by sundown.
You see the spirit in these men?
Do you see the new spirit?
Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.
To have this battalion relieved in... in a defeat... or even to have it reinforced from troops from the reserve regiment...
If we were to stall before reaching the top, well...
Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!
I've waited all my life for this.
I've worked, slaved, eaten, oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity... and I don't intend to give it up now.
You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.
I mean, you're young.
You're just out of the academy.
You know, you... you've got your war.
Fifteen years, this... this is my first war!
John, someday you'll understand.
You're like a son to me, John.
You know what my son does?
He's a bait salesman.
You've done a hell of a job, John.
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything... everything that you deserve.
Thank you, sir.
God...
Goddamn it! I want three runners!
Get me three runners!
You go back to the rear as far as you have to go to find water... and get back here with it as fast as you can!
We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything we got at 'em!
We're going all the way!
Nothing's stopping us!
It's high ground by nightfall!
You seen many dead people?
Plenty.
They're no different than dead dogs... once you get used to the idea.
They're meat, kid.
Are you righteous?
Kind?
Does your confidence lie in this?
Are you loved by all?
Know that I was too.
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?
Truth?
This way!
Get down!
Get on the fucking ground!
Get fucking down now!
Get down! Get down!
Get down! Stay there!
Get back!
Get on the fucking ground!
Now!
This great evil.
Where does it come from?
How did it steal into the world?
What seed, what root did it grow from?
Who's doing this?
Who's killing us... robbing us of life and light... mocking us with the sight of what we might have known?
Does our ruin benefit the earth?
Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine?
Is this darkness in you too?
Have you passed through this night?
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.
You're dying.
See them birds up there?
They're gonna eat you raw.
Where you're going, you're not coming back from.
What are you to me?
Nothin'.
Have a seat here.
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.
I already told him.
It's a hard thing to do.
Difficult decision to make.
I don't think you're tough enough.
You're too soft.
You're just too soft-hearted.
You're not tough-fibered enough.
Anyway, it's... it's my decision to make, and I've already made it.
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.
Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?
Have you?
I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.
I don't want it in the records of the battalion where I commanded... and there's no reason for you to have it on your records.
This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.
Look at this jungle.
Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.
Nature's cruel, Staros.
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment... to the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Washington for reasons of ill health.
You're a lawyer.
You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.
- Doesn't matter.
I can fix that.
Anyway, you probably will have it.
I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star... and I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.
Might as well have the Purple Heart too.
Why?
Because of that scratch on your face... and because of those cuts on your hands.
Now, you listen to me, Staros.
I think it's best you go back right away with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.
It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.
The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.
This is from Colonel Tall.
"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride."
"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal."
"Tomorrow, the division commander will arrive to make a personal inspection of the line."
"After the inspection, we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment."
"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line."
That's all.
Hours like months.
Days like years.
Walked into the golden age... stood on the shores of a new world.
I would've come by and paid you guys a visit... but...
I just felt like being alone, you know.
Yeah?
We... We wanted to thank you, sir... for asking to make that flanking move... for watching out for us... keeping us together.
We're all sorry to see you go.
We feel like you got a rotten deal.
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.
The tough part is... not knowing if you're doing any good.
That's the hard part.
But it doesn't matter.
I don't care. I'm...
I'm glad to be going.
I'm glad.
There's still time.
We could file a complaint.
For what?
What good would that do?
Anyway, I want to go.
Leave it alone. Let it lay.
What does that mean, sir?
It means,
"You've been like my sons."
You are my sons.
My dear sons.
Push up.
You live inside me now.
I'll carry you wherever I go.
Can't nothing make you forget it.
Each time you start from scratch.
War don't ennoble men.
It turns 'em into dogs.
Poisons the soul.
My dear wife.
You get something twisted out of your insides... by all this blood, filth and noise.
I want to stay changeless for you.
I want to come back to you the man I was before.
How do we get to those other shores... to those blue hills?
Love.
Where does it come from?
Who lit this flame in us?
No war can put it out... conquer it.
I was a prisoner.
You set me free.
No matter how much training you got, how careful you are... it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.
Makes no difference who you are or how tough a guy you might be.
If you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.
I look at that boy dying...
I don't feel nothing.
I don't care about nothing anymore.
Sounds like bliss.
I don't have that feeling yet... that numbness.
Not like the rest of you guys.
Maybe 'cause I knew what to expect.
Maybe I was just frozen up already.
I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.
Or talked to one.
I don't want to...
I don't want to feel the desire.
All right. Abrahams!
Abrahams, here you go.
Stack! Where's Stack?
Bring him out. Here.
Bell?
Bell!
Another one for Bell.
Another one for Bell.
Dear Jack...
I've met an Air Force captain.
I've fallen in love with him.
I want a divorce to marry him.
I know you can say no, but I'm asking you anyway... out of the memory of what we had together.
Forgive me.
It just got too lonely, Jack.
We'll meet again someday.
People who have been as close as we've been always meet again.
I have no right to speak to you this way.
I can't stop myself.
A habit so strong.
Oh, my friend of all those shining years... help me leave you.
What's your name?
We were a family.
How'd it break up and come apart... so that now we're turned against each other... each standing in the other's light?
How did we lose the good that was given us... let it slip away... scatter it, careless?
What's keeping us from reaching out... touching the glory?
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap... long ago.
They leave you here?
Yep.
I slowed 'em up.
Don't mind, really.
The medic, he fixed me up pretty good.
I got plenty of ammo.
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.
Yeah.
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.
What are you doing down here?
Just, you know...
I'm heading back to the company.
Yeah.
Well, you give all them boys my best.
You can come with me if you want.
I'll help you along.
Nah, it's nice and quiet... peaceful up here.
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.
I'll remind 'em.
Okay.
Hey, Witt.
Who you making trouble for today?
What do you mean?
Well, isn't that what you like to do?
Turn left when they say go right?
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?
I always felt like you did.
Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?
One day I can come up and talk to you.
By the next day... it's like we never even met.
Lonely house now.
You ever get lonely?
Only around people.
Only around people.
You still believing in the beautiful light, are you?
How do you do that?
You're a magician to me.
I still see a spark in you.
One man looks at a dying bird... and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.
But death's got the final word.
It's laughing at him.
Another man sees that same bird... feels the glory... feels something smiling through it.
We need to get out of here right now.
You explain to... to headquarters the situation?
- No.
- Do they know where we are?
'Cause we're sitting ducks out here.
Well, I think that's up to me to judge, Sergeant.
No, I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are.
Okay? It's easy.
Hey, Weld get headquarters on that thing.
The fire's coming closer, sir.
Line's cut.
This line?
Well, we need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut... and we need to find out how close they are.
Come on.
Okay, okay.
Hey, you.
You go.
You're going, Fife.
Coombs. You go too.
- Come on.
- I'll go.
But I want you to know I think the whole thing's a bad idea though.
If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant... they're gonna knock our position to hell and flinders.
Well, you don't have to go, Private.
There's others who'll volunteer.
No, I want to go, sir. In case something bad happens, I want to be there.
All right.
Y-You stay by the river.
That jungle's too thick.
And be very careful.
I will.
Good luck, Witt.
You okay, Fife?
A reinforced battalion.
We need to go back, tell the lieutenant.
Let's go.
I'm hit!
Do it! Split up!
Get back!
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.
We'll be all right.
My friend here doesn't have long.
So, you go.
You go on ahead.
Witt.
They're coming.
I gotta go.
I don't want you to be afraid.
Just hide out here till you hear firing.
Then push on down the river.
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back. They're coming!
Fall back.
Where's Witt?
Fife, where's Witt?
Fife, where's Witt?
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?
America.
Where's your spark now?
Now, I know you men have been making and drinking this goddamn swipe.
That's okay by me.
Everything a lie.
Any man in an outfit of mine can get as drunk as he wants to every night.
Everything you hear, everything you see.
As long as he's ready and in shape to make reveille and carry out any assignment he is given.
If he can't do that, he's gonna have trouble from me.
So much to spew out.
Now, I prefer to think of myself as a family man... and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.
We are a family.
I'm the father.
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.
They just keep coming, one after another.
And whether you guys like it or not, that makes you all the children in this family.
Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.
If any of you men want to see me about anything...
- You're in a box.
- Anything at all...
A moving box.
You will find that I am available.
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.
It's gonna be a long time before we get home.
They want you dead... or in their lie.
Only one thing a man can do... find something that's his... make an island for himself.
If I never meet you in this life... let me feel the lack.
A glance from your eyes... and my life will be yours.
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.
I mean, I don't know what, you know... what your plans are, but...
I'm determined now.
I've been through the thick and thin of it.
You know, I may be young, but I've lived plenty of life.
I'm ready to start living it good.
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna get a whole lot worse before it gets better.
You know, 'cause life ain't supposed to be that hard when you're young.
Well, I... I figure after this, the worst is gonna be gone though.
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.
That's what's gonna happen.
I'm getting older now.
By no means old, but older.
Where is it that we were together?
Who were you that I lived with... walked with?
The brother.
The friend.
Darkness and light.
Strife and love.
Are they the workings of one mind... the features of the same face?
O my soul... let me be in you now.
Look out through my eyes.
Look out at the things you made.
All things shining.
Look out the window.
And doesn't this remind you of when you were in the boat?
And then later that night, you were lying, looking up at the ceiling, and the water in your head... was not dissimilar from the landscape, and you think to yourself,
"Why is it that the landscape... is moving, but... the boat is still?"
And also...
Where is it that you're from?
- Cleveland.
- Cleveland.
- Lake Erie.
- Erie.
Do you have any parents back in, uh, Erie?
They passed on recently.
And, uh, do you have a wife... in Erie?
No.
- A fiancee?
- Well, I...
I had one of those, but, um, she changed her mind.
- She found herself somebody else.
- No.
Yes, she did.
Well, that doesn't explain... why you've come all the way out here, all the way out here to hell.
I, uh, have a job out in the town of Machine.
Machine? That's the end of the line.
- Is it?
- Yes.
Well, I... received a letter... from the people at Dickinson's
Metal Works...
Oh. assuring me of a job there.
Is that so?
Yes. I'm an accountant.
I wouldn't know, because, uh, I don't read, but, uh, I'll tell you one thing for sure:
I wouldn't trust no words written down on no piece of paper, especially from no "Dickinson" out in the town of Machine.
- You're just as likely to find your own grave.
Look. They're shooting buffalo.
Government says... killed a million of 'em last year alone.
Pardon me, sir. Could you please direct me towards the office?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How do you do, sir?
I'm Bill Blake, your new accountant from Cleveland.
What the heck are you doin' here?
Well, uh, I have here this letter... which confirms my position here.
Well, this letter is postmarked two months ago.
Makes you about a month late.
This here is Mr. Olafsen.
He's our new accountant.
I'm sorry. I think there's been some mistake.
- Look, Mr. Black,
- Blake.
I'm a very busy man, and Mr. Dickinson does not pay me for idle conversation.
Well, I'm sure he doesn't, but this letter confirms my position here.
Now, I've spent everything I had left after my parent's funeral just to get here.
Listen, Mr. Black,
I've got a lot of work to do here, and this ain't my business.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Dickinson.
No, I-I don't think you want to do that.
I insist on speaking to Mr. Dickinson, sir.
You insist?
- I insist.
- You insist?
Yes, I do.
Well, go on then, lad.
There's the door.
All right then.
Go on then!
Well, I will.
Hello?
Mr. Dickinson?
Who the hell are you?
And where did you get that goddamn clown suit? Cleveland?
Well, actually, yes, sir.
I did, uh, get it in Cleveland.
What the hell are you doin' in my office?
Well, I-I-I came to talk about my job.
The only job you're gonna get in here is pushin' up daisies from a pine box.
Now get out.
Thank you very much, sir.
Back to work,
Mr. Olafsen.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Pardon me, sir.
Could I get a bottle, please?
We liked you better when you was a whore.
Jackass.
Shit!
Why don't you just paint my portrait?
I'm sorry.
- Let me help here. One.
- This one's no good. No, it's ruined.
- Two.
- It's no good.
Oh, here. Oh!
Watch yourself.
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.
Here. Have a drink.
Would you like a drink?
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Would you mind walking me away from here?
- S-Sure. Sure.
- Yeah?
I'll just get my suitcase.
- It's that way.
- All right.
Oh, shit.
I have a sneaking suspicion that that large man back there was inebriated.
- I was gonna say something, but
I don't wanna cause any trouble.
No, I think it's best.
That's my room.
Wasn't... expecting any visitor.
- Like it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.
These flowers. Gosh.
They really are something.
Yeah. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I made them from paper.
If I ever get the money,
I'd like to make them out of cloth.
Silk.
And I'd put a drop of perfume...
French perfume... in each one.
What does it smell like?
- Paper.
- Well, it is paper.
Hey, Bill.
You got any tobacco anywhere?
- No, I don't smoke.
- Damn.
Ow!
Oh, watch it.
It's loaded.
Why do you have this?
'Cause this is America.
Charlie.
You know, Thel,
I never wanted to go away.
I know we said it was, uh, it was all over and everything, but... you were always in my heart, Thel.
Always.
I, uh...
I brought you, uh...
Well, it's a present.
A present?
Well, I, uh...
I'm... I'm goin'.
And, uh,
I'm... I'm sorry, Thel, for, uh, for intrudin'.
Well, I never really loved you anyway.
No, Charlie.
- I never stopped lovingly, Thel.
- Don't!
Thel.
Here's white man's metal next to your heart.
I tried to cut it out, but it's too deep inside.
A knife would cut your heart instead... and release the spirit from within.
Stupid fucking white man.
Do you have any tobacco?
I don't smoke.
Hey, Wilson, got any extra tobacco?
Well, of course you wouldn't have any extra tobacco. How 'bout you?
Shit. You ain't even old enough to smoke.
Mr. John Dickinson.
Last night, my youngest son, Charlie...
God bless his soul... was gunned down in cold blood right here in our own hotel.
The gutless murderer, one Mr. Bill Blake, also shot to death Miss Thel Russel, the fiancée of my beloved son.
Not only that, but he stole a very spirited and valuable horse, a beautiful young pinto that belonged to my personal family stable.
Hell, only, a pinto ain't rightly a horse to fret much about, if the truth be told.
Shut up!
You three are supposed to be the finest killers of men and Indians... in this here half of the world.
Cole Wilson, your reputation is already a legend.
You I know I can trust.
Conway Twill, you're a real good killer, but be sure you keep that goddamn trap shut.
And Johnny
"The Kid"Pickett.
I heard tell you killed 14 men.
I doubt you've seen that many years, and I ain't even gonna tell you what I really think of you.
- I always work alone.
- Uh, excuse me there, Mr. Dickinson, but, uh, rightly I, I never have worked with anyone else either.
- I never have.
- Uh, yeah, m-me neither.
Shut up!
My boy Charlie is dead!
Oh, I ain't askin' this time.
I'm tellin', and if somebody don't like it,
I'm prepared to do a little killin' of my own.
Now, that bastard couldn't have got too far yet.
Well, why don't we just say there, Mr. Dickinson, sir,
I think we oughta start uh, fresh in the mornin'.
I mean, it's well after noon now, and time we get finished, all packed up and...
I want him brought here to me... alive or dead don't matter, though I reckon dead would be easier.
I'm a-hiring boys on an exclusive basis, and I'm willing pay more money than you've ever seen before.
Boys, the hunt is on.
Stupid fucking white man.
I want this out over the wires.
Post a $500 reward from here to hell and back.
Notify every marshal, deputy and possum-skinnin' lowlife in the goddamn territory.
Bring everybody in.
I want that bastard's head.
And make sure you include a full description of my pinto. I want that horse back.
Goddamn pinto is a stupid damn animal.
Stupid as the day is long.
Got his heart so set on one.
Buy yourself a sorrel horse... and paint some white spots on him as far as I'm concerned.
Jesus Christ.
Course, ya can't put much stock in a man who spends the most part of a conversation... talkin' to a bear.
Talkin' to a goddamn bear.
The round stones beneath the earth... have spoken through the fire.
What?
Things which are alike, in nature, grow to look alike, and the speaking stones have lain a long time lookin' at the sun.
The speaking stones?
Some believe they descend with the lightning, but I believe they are on the ground and are projected downward by the bolt.
Did you kill the white man who killed you?
I'm not dead.
What name were you given at birth, stupid white man?
Blake.
William Blake.
Is this a lie?
Or a white man's trick?
No, I'm William Blake.
Then you are a dead man.
I'm sorry. I d...
I don't understand.
Is your name really
William Blake?
Yes.
Every night... and every morn', some to misery are born.
Every morn' and every night, some are born to sweet delight.
Some are born to sweet delight.
Some are born to endless night.
I really don't understand.
But I understand,
William Blake.
You were a poet and a painter.
And now, you are a killer of white men.
You must rest now,
William Blake.
Some are born to sweet delight.
Some are born to endless night.
Makin' biscuits, Mommy.
Sweetheart.
You didn't touch it, did you?
- Huh?
- No.
- You swear to me.
- I swear.
Swear to me you're tellin' the truth.
Yes, I swear I'm tellin' the truth.
Not a goddamn word to no one, ever.
You understand?
Don't ever ask me no questions.
Where are we?
You are being followed,
William Blake.
Are you sure?
I mean, how do you know?
Often the evil stench of white man precedes him.
Why don't we, uh...
Maybe we should, uh...
What should we do?
The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn from the crow.
Ever wish you were the moon?
Geez, my Henry's cold.
Aw, come on!
My britches been open like that how long?
Only been ridin' a couple of days together, but Jesus, one of you fellas could've mentioned the fact that...
Unsaddle your goddamn horses.
Unsaddle your goddamn horse.
Go on.
- Geez.
- An Injun dug this fire pit.
Oh.
Oh, an Indian.
We ain't trackin' no goddamn
Injuns, Cole. I mean, uh, hell, Dickinson didn't say nothin' about trackin' no goddamn Injuns.
I mean, the boy's name is William Blake.
You know a lotta Indians, do ya, named
William Blake? I mean, "Howdy, Chief Billy..."
D'you hear somethin'?
Huh?
- Did ya?
- No. No.
I guess it was nothin'.
You know about Wilson?
- What?
- Do you know about Cole Wilson?
What kinda question is that?
'Course I know about Cole Wilson.
Everybody knows about him.
He's a livin' legend.
Fucked his parents.
- He what?
- He fucked his parents.
- Both of 'em?
- Yeah.
Mother. Father. Parents.
Both of 'em. Fucked 'em.
Oh.
And you know what I heard?
After he killed 'em, he cooked 'em up and ate 'em.
Are you telling me he killed both his pa...
I'm tellin' you he killed 'em. He fucked 'em.
He cooked 'em up. He ate 'em.
He ain't got a goddamn conscience.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
He'd just as soon slit our goddamn throats in the middle of the night as walk.
Course, someone your age, Jesus, if you was to put one in him...
"Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett
Slays Cole Wilson."
William Blake, do you know how to use this weapon?
- Not really.
- That weapon will replace your tongue.
You will learn to speak through it, and your poetry will now be written with blood.
What is your name?
My name is Nobody.
- Excuse me?
- My name is Exaybachay:
He Who Talks Loud,
Saying Nothing.
He Who Talks...
I thought you said your name was Nobody.
I prefer to be called Nobody.
Nobody?
Um, shouldn't you be with your own tribe or somethin'?
My blood is mixed.
My mother was
Ohm gahpi phi gun ni.
My father is
Abso luka.
This mixture was not respected.
As a small boy,
I was often left to myself.
So I spent many months stalking the elk people... to prove I would soon become a good hunter.
One day, finally, my elk relatives took pity on me, and a young elk gave his life to me.
With only my knife,
I took his life.
As I was preparing to cut the meat, white men came upon me.
They were English soldiers.
I cut one with my knife, but they hit me on the head with a rifle.
All went black.
My spirit seemed to leave me.
I was then taken east... in a cage.
I was taken to Toronto, then Philadelphia... and then to New York.
And each time I arrived in another city, somehow the white men had moved... all their people there ahead of me.
Each new city contained the same white people as the last, and I could not understand how a whole city of people... could be moved so quickly.
Eventually, I was taken on a ship... across the great sea... over to England, and I was paraded before them... like a captured animal, an exhibit.
And so I mimicked them, imitating their ways, hoping that they might lose interest in this young savage, but their interest only grew.
So they placed me into the white man's schools.
It was there that I discovered... in a book... the words that you,
William Blake, had written.
They were powerful words, and they spoke to me.
But I made careful plans, and I eventually escaped.
Once again, I crossed the great ocean.
I saw many sad things... as I made my way back to the lands of my people.
Once they realized who I was, the stories of my adventures angered them.
They called me a liar.
"Exaybachay."
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing.
They ridiculed me.
My own people.
And I was left to wander the earth alone.
I am Nobody.
Ain't ya glad the sun kind of sets? Prepares you like?
I mean, what if it, like, went out sudden, like, say, blowin' out a candle or somethin'?
I mean... You know, one minute we're ridin' along, we can see everything and each other... and, boom, the next minute is just... you're in total darkness.
That'd scare the bejesus outta me.
Once upon a time, there were three bears in the forest.
A big bear, a medium mommy bear... and a tiny little baby bear.
One mornin', they were gonna eat their breakfast porridge.
They had a big bowl, a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl.
That porridge was too hot.
Stupid white man.
- So they went to take a walk.
- William Blake, you go to them.
- Along came this girl. She was...
- What?
Alone? Why don't we just go around them?
No!
You go.
It's a test.
I don't know those people, and they don't look very friendly.
- What if they kill me?
- Nobody will observe.
She got sleepy, and she went into their bedroom.
- There was a big bed, a medium bed and a tiny little bed. - All right.
- I'll go.
- ...their tiny bed.
I'd rather not, but I'll go.
The bears got home.
Papa said,
"Somebody here ate all our porridge."
- What's the best way to get down there?
- Be quiet and go.
- And he scalped her,
- All right. and he tore her head off her body.
And he took that golden hair, and he made a sweater for baby bear.
- That's terrible.
- Tonight we're reminded... of the evil emperor
Nero Augustus.
He was the scourge of all the Christians.
What's a scourge?
It's... It's like when somethin' real bad happens.
Like when everybody gets killed and you can't do anything about it.
Like a swarm of locusts.
For the entertainment of his guests,
Nero would illuminate his whole garden... with bodies of live Christians covered in burning oil... strung up on flaming crosses, crucified.
And at dinner, he would have the Christians rubbed by his guards... with aromatic herbs and garlic... and sewn up into sacks.
And then they'd throw these sacks to the wild dogs.
Well, that's terrible.
- It's horrible.
- Terrible's what it is.
You know, I just... I can't drink whiskey like I used to could.
My old belly just ain't no account.
I get the shits every time, don't you know?
I'm sorry, Big George.
I got some food here that even Goldilocks never tasted.
I think this is gonna fix up your old gut.
These beans is shit.
Why don't you shut your goddamn trap and just eat your beans?
Them, uh... There's possum in these beans, and spices too.
- I tried hard.
- Well, Sally,
I don't give a pig's ass what anybody says.
I still say you make a hell of a pot of beans.
Now why don't you say us a grace outta the Good Book, would you?
Thank you, Big George.
I'd be delighted to do that.
"This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand;
And I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee;
And I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day... unto the fowls of the air and the wild beasts of the earth."
Amen.
- What's a Philistine?
- Well, it's just a real dirty person.
Hello.
I smelled beans.
Who are you travelin' with?
I'm with Nobody.
Where you headed?
I don't know.
- Do you like beans?
- I...
I love beans.
Have you got any tobacco?
- I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
- Would you give me some tobacco?
- I would if I had some.
- I'll trade you some beans for some tobacco.
I don't have any tobacco, but I'd love some beans.
Hurt.
- Yes.
- Eyeglasses.
- Yes.
- Pretty suit too.
- I clean up real good, you know.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
- What size shoes are those?
- Ten.
- They look very comfortable. Are they?
Not too bad.
What kinda flower is that?
Well, it's a rose... that's made out of paper.
- Paper?
- Rose.
Now you see there?
- Look at the edge on that knife.
- Hmm.
- Feel that.
- I'd rather not.
Aw, go on.
That...
That is a very, very sharp knife, that is.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Yeah.
What do you call it?
- Pretty.
- I'm sorry?
That hat.
What do you call it?
I'm really not sure.
Ah, your hair.
Your hair is soft.
It's like a girl's.
By God, it is soft.
Now how do you get it that way?
See, this old stuff of mine, it just...
Well, it's just like old barn hay.
- There ain't a durn thing you can do with it.
How do you... How do you get it that way and keep it like that?
Just lucky, I guess.
Lucky. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Goddamn it.
You keep your hand off of it.
I thought I told you not to touch me.
I don't give a good goddamn what you told me.
You keep your hands off his hair.
Why? What's that to do with you then, eh?
That's got plenty to do with me, goddamn it.
- Really? This one's mine!
- That's right.
- This one's yours?
- Yes!
This one's mine, Big George.
You had the last one.
- Is that a fact?
- I saw him first.
I don't give a shit who saw what and who did what or who did who.
You had the last Philistine.
This one's mine.
If I want this one,
I'll have him, too, by God.
Fine. What happens if I just shoot you then, eh?
- What do you think about that?
- You gonna shoot me?
- That's right.
- Well, why don't you shoot me then, goddamn it?
- I will. I'll shoot you right now.
- Come on. Shoot me.
- I will.
- Well, quit talkin' about it and do it, by God.
I will.
- There you go.
- Good God, I'm hit! Lord have mercy!
Burns like hell fire!
You son of a bitch.
I'm gonna have to kill somebody now.
Well, goddamn it,
I guess nobody gets you.
What the hell?
- Nobody.
Oh, Jesus' bears and squirrels.
I cooked, I cleaned, and I sewed, and I have a right to get...
Yee!
Hootka.
That's me.
Wanted.
"The brutal murders of one Thel Russell and one Charles Ludlow Dickinson."
I didn't kill Thel.
I didn't kill Thel.
Your actions are useless.
This is complete fabrication.
There can't be...
You cannot stop the clouds by the building of a ship.
What? What did you say?
You know, I've had it up to here with this Indian malarkey.
I haven't understood a single word you've said since I met you, not one single word.
Are you sure you have no tobacco?
I've already told you
I don't smoke.
If I don't smoke, there's a pretty good chance that I don't have any tobacco.
William Blake.
I guess the best advice just not to take any damn advice.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell... is that?
What's that say?
Read it.
- "Wanted: William Blake."
- Huh?
"In the amount of $500."
Shit.
Hell, ain't we about more fucked than a whore at closin' time, huh?
Thanks to goddamn
Mr. Dickinson, huh?
I'll tell you what that there says, huh?
It says some pelt-wearin' trapper, some stinkin' bean-suckin' possum skinner, he's gonna collect that reward money.
Make you feel good?
Huh?
- Goddamn pelt skinner.
- I'll be damn.
Five hundred dollars.
I don't understand.
I thought we was hired exclusive.
I mean, he paid us in gold in advance.
I'm out here... I'm out here in the middle of shits creek... with two local lunatics.
One who don't say nothin'...
And the other one, he won't never stop yappin'!
You gonna shed tears for us?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- And why not?
- Because it ain't good for your health.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
Fuck you.
Goddamn it.
Jesus, Cole.
He's just a kid.
He's a Navajo mud toy now.
Yeah.
Aho.
I have just ingested... the food of the Great Spirit... and Father Peyote.
Do you think I could have a little bite of it?
It's not for use even for William Blake.
Flowers of the medicine... give you sacred visions that are not for you right now.
My southern brothers were prohibited from using it... by the Spanish devils.
But now, even the Notoemne and the Dene... know of its loving ways.
What?
What are you lookin' at?
William Blake.
It's so strange that you don't remember any of your poetry.
I don't know anything about poetry.
Oh, you're so modest.
Listen...
I feel very weak.
I'm hungry.
Quest for vision is a great blessing,
William Blake.
To do so, one must go without food and water.
All the sacred spirits... recognize those who fast.
It's good to prepare for a journey in this way.
I seem to have misplaced my eyeglasses.
I can't see clearly.
Perhaps you will see more clearly without them.
You're a very strange man.
Very strange.
May the Great Spirit watch over you, William Blake.
Nobody?
Nobody?
Nobody?
Nobody?
- Hey, Marvin.
- What?
How come Dickinson's telegram didn't give no description of the horse... this murderin' fucker stole?
It did, Lee. A pinto, just like that one.
White legs, brown ass, brown sides.
It did? I don't think it did, Marvin.
Well, you asshole... You got the damn telegram on you. Take it out and look.
That's right. Yeah, I got it here.
I'll check it.
Maybe I been thinkin' of them wanted posters.
Lee! It's him!
You William Blake?
Yes, I am.
Do you know my poetry?
Some are born to endless night.
Well, Rome weren't built in a day, Cole.
Course, uh, I wasn't overseein' that particular job.
Fresh kill.
Yeah. No damn tobacco, that's for sure.
This, uh, some kind of telegram or somethin'?
What's that say?
Dickinson again.
Oh, goddamn Dickinson. You mean to tell me he's even got the law involved in this now?
Jesus.
Tell you one thing. FL, uh, that there
Blake fella keeps on shootin' marshals,
I'll wind up likin' the bastard.
Looks like a goddamn religious icon.
Anyhow, greenback to the beginning of the story, my granddaddy come over from Scotland, you see.
He was actually part of the Mactwill clan.
Uh, the, uh, clan tartan was kind of gold and purple, if I remember correctly.
I never wore a lick of it myself.
Dropped the "Mac" part of the name when he decided to come out West... on account of he figured it'd get him more work and all.
How 'bout your family history there, Cole? Let me guess.
Kind of figured you for a German, huh?
I mean, am I right?
Am I close?
Austrian?
I'd like to speak with
Mr. Dickinson, please.
- I insist on speaking with Mr. Dickinson.
Goddamn redskins.
Oh!
- Nobody?
- William Blake.
She's upset.
She's beautiful.
- She didn't mean to call you that.
- Huh?
But you sure interrupted a very romantic moment, William Blake.
Oh. I'm sorry.
You stay here 'til I return.
Don't let the sun burn a hole in your ass, William Blake.
Rise now and drive your cart and plow... over the bones of the dead.
Do you still have my eyeglasses?
No. I traded 'em.
- You traded them?
- Do you have any tobacco?
No. I traded it.
- For what?
- I'm not telling.
- Liar.
- Thief.
I don't care if you were married 16 times
I still love you
Yo-ho yo-ho-yo
I will take you to the bridge made of waters.
The mirror.
Then you will be taken up to the next level of the world.
The place where
William Blake is from.
Where his spirit belongs.
I must make sure that you pass back through the mirror at the place... where the sea meets the sky.
White man's trading post.
Indians get diseases there.
What do you mean?
Smallpox, consumption.
Blankets are infected.
It spreads through the villages.
I see you have acquired a new weapon.
Hmm? Oh, yes.
A Winchester.
- Here. Take it.
- No.
No, really.
Take it.
I took it off a dead white man.
Did William Blake kill this white man?
Yes.
William Blake killed the white man.
We need a canoe.
Water.
"The brutal murders of Charles Dickinson and fiancée, Thel Russell.
Also the murders of the following territorial marshals...
...deputy... Big George Drakoulious,
Benmont Tench and one Salvatore Sally Jenko."
- It's not bad.
- Huh?
It's not a bad illustration of you, William Blake.
Well, I want you to have it.
- It's a present.
- Aho.
Good morning.
May you serve the Lord, and may His holy dominion guide you through your dismal life.
How can I be of assistance, my poor man?
All our ammunition is guaranteed.
This latest batch was, in fact, personally blessed by the archbishop of Detroit.
Good morning.
May our Lord Jesus Christ wash this earth with His holy light... and purge its darkest places from heathens and philistines.
The vision of Christ that thou dost see... is my vision's greatest enemy.
Do you have tobacco?
We sure don't.
Aren't those tins of tobacco right there behind you?
Sure are, but those cans are empty.
There's no tobacco in them.
Perhaps I could interest you in some beads... or possibly a blanket.
Blanket.
Yes, my fine fellow.
Ammunition.
Uh, I'd like some tobacco, please.
Well, I may have one or two twists left.
From my personal supply, you understand.
For good friends only.
Good Lord.
You're William Blake.
Yes, I am.
By the grace of the Lord Almighty.
Sir, would it be presumptuous of me to ask you for... for your autograph?
Please, kind sir.
It would be a great honor.
Pardon me.
There's my autograph.
God damn your soul to the fires of hell.
He already has.
Hootka.
I'm tired.
I'll free the horses.
I see you collected some more white man's metal.
Yes. I seem to be a magnet for it.
Oh, man.
Good day for a canoe ride.
Nobody?
Is this the boat... that'll take me across the mirror of water?
No.
This boat's not strong enough,
William Blake.
William Blake is a legend now
He's a good friend of mine
Stand up,
William Blake.
William Blake.
Ah.
Walk proudly,
William Blake.
That man there?
I know him.
He's a great builder of sea canoes.
Hello.
I prepared your canoe with cedar boughs.
It's time for you to leave now, William Blake.
Time for you to go back to where you came from.
You mean Cleveland?
Back to the place where all the spirits came from... and where all the spirits return.
This world will no longer concern you.
Found some tobacco.
The tobacco is for your voyage,
William Blake.
Nobody.
I don't smoke.
Aho, William Blake.
(woman)? What a fellowship
? What a joy divine
? Leaning on the everlasting arms
? What a blessed peace
? What a joy is mine
? Leaning on the everlasting arms
? Leaning on Jesus
? Leaning on Jesus
(man) His funeral was
<i筺 a blistering hot August afternoon,
just outside the town of Deadwood.
I suppose there was a rough justice to it,
the way he met his end after sending
so many others to early graves.
It didn't make the moment easier
on any of his friends.
I don't know why he never slept in my bed sinced he come to Deadwood.
Only got interested once.
The timing was just wrong.
Too much had happened to him before he got here.
I was awful attached to him.
All of us were. He had that kind of effect on people.
I got a feeling maybe in some ways you knew him best, Charley.
(glass smashes)
You know, I don't mind you shootin' glasses off of my dog's head, Marshal, but fondlin' him like that, you'll ruin him for fightin'.
That dog's bred for fightin'.
You oughta understand that.
You've had more fights than anybody.
(Charley) He fashioned himself as
just an ordinary man, in no way special.
But, of course, that was a deception.
By luck or design, it had fallen to him
to play the hero's part,
and, to the very end,
he embraced his fate.
Two damn weeks, ain't a damn sight of a buffalo.
Never thought it possible.
How's a man supposed to make a livin'?
(tribal chanting)
(horse whinnies)
That's a funeral platform.
Must be on some kind of vigil for the dead Indian next to him.
(speaks Sioux)
Says he's a Sioux, named He Who Whistles.
He's a chief.
That's his wife lying there next to him.
They had to leave a tribe.
They couldn't find no buffalo.
Figured since he'd failed his people and he'd failed his wife, he had to go off and find his own medicine.
Said he had a dream.
Had to fight a white-eye with long hair.
That looks to be you, Bill.
What the hell does this whistler want to fight me for?
His religion.
He wins, his people live.
He's gonna hang your scalp on a lodge pole.
Tell him I'm sorry about his woman and his tribe.
(speaks Sioux)
Tell him thanks, and I'll be on my way.
(war cry)
He wants me to show some colour.
Fine.
(cocks rifle)
- Don't kill him, Bill.
- Man knows what he wants!
Bad luck to kill an Indian in a religious frame of mind!
He chose it!
He must have got more than 20 hides out there. Winter prime.
Them hides'll fetch a dollar apiece in
Omaha. Let's run him off. What say you?
First feller who shows up today gonna buy a drink, and you're gonna run him off.
NEBRASKA TERRITORY
Whisky.
It'd be awfully neighbourly if you was to buy me a drink.
I generally only buy whisky for my friends.
I don't see no reason why a man come in here and insult me.
Watch his gun!
Oh! I'm shot!
You oughta understand, you ever touch another man's hat...
TOMMY DRUM'S SALOON
HAYS CITY, 1870
"Ma, Ma, who's my pa?"
"Wild Bill Hickok. Ha-ha-ha."
Please, Mr Wild Bill. Don't shoot me now.
I ain't done nothin' wrong.
- Don't shoot me, Mr Wild Bill.
- What's this about?
I kicked some drunk soldier's ass around about a week ago. Threw him in jail.
Figure these are his friends.
- Maybe you oughta apologise...
- I don't apologise!
Not to you or anybody else. Not ever.
Shouldn't touch another man's hat.
I ain't wearin' no pistols.
(woman screams)
Aaaagh!
Take 'em, Bill. They're gonna kill you.
(woman screams)
(soldier) Damn you! Kill him!
(band plays "The Yellow Rose of Texas")
ABILENE, KANSAS
(whooping)
Yee-ha!
Yee-ha!
(silence)
- Just funning, Marshal.
- Where are you from?
Texas, 50 miles north of Waco.
I work for...
I'm a Union man.
Fought four years against your kind.
- You been firing that weapon, Phil?
- Lots of fellers here...
I'm not talking to them, I'm talking to you!
You got an explanation why you was firing that weapon, breaking a city ordinance?
What's the matter, Bill? You miss me?
That why you're mad at Phil here?
You'd best hand over the gun, Phil.
Otherwise I'm just gonna have to step over there and slap you around some.
Who else?!
(man) Bill!
He's dead. You shot your own deputy.
(man) He shot Phil Coe, then he shot Mike Williams.
I'm gonna go get my shotgun, then I'm gonna go get my horse.
By the time I get back, I see one son of a bitch on the street, I'll kill 'em.
(sobs)
After Abilene, Bill was at loose ends.
He drifted East and accepted the
invitation of his friend Buffalo Bill Cody
to join his theatrical production
"Scouts of the Plains".
As a thespian he was,
by all reports, simply dreadful.
BOWERY THEATRE
NEW YORK
And now, my friends, a true story of courage as actually lived and fought by my dear friend of many years,
James Butler Hickok, known throughout the West as Wild Bill!
(applause)
I say, Wild Bill, where have you been?
(audience murmuring)
I say, old pard, where have you been?
(laughter)
What has detained you so long?
(sparse applause)
I was riding my horse, Black Nell, peacefully along the river when I was corralled by a party of hostiles.
- (war drum)
- Hostiles? What kind of hostiles?
Indians!
Yes. What tribe of Indians, Wild Bill?
- They were Sioux. Sioux Indians.
- And who was their chief?
Up there! Turn down the damn light.
Damn near blind a feller.
I say, Wild Bill, who was their chief?
KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI
Keep your eyes open.
You have glaucoma, Mr Hickok.
It's often a result from too much proximity to, uh... infected females.
Keep your eyes straight ahead.
If you take my meaning.
I had some trouble about ten years back.
Cleared right up when the local doc stuck a hot wire up my privates.
How bad's it gonna get?
You are losing your eyesight, Mr Hickok.
May take... two years, may take... ten.
I expect I just spent too much time staring at the prairie sun.
By the summer of the nation's centennial,
CHEYENNE, JULY 1876
Bill had become an idle drifter.
Like myself, he was addicted to whisky,
cards, and the wastrel's life.
My name is Charles Prince,
English born and educated,
but for reasons of temperament,
America had become my adopted home.
As I much prefer to observe life
in the raw, I took myself west.
I was not disappointed.
Mighty interesting game, poker.
Can't tell you how many times in my life
I've gone bust.
Yes, but it's not the same for you.
You don't know what real poverty is.
Everybody wants to buy the great Wild Bill dinner or drinks.
This pot is mine. Three kings.
Mr Hickok?
Mr Hickok, there's a man in the street gonna give me a dollar to come in here and tell you that you're a coward, and a wife stealer... and I can't say the rest, but it was much worse.
What'd he say?
Bill Hickok!
I'm callin' you out!
Hickok!
You gonna ride or hide?
What's the matter?
Afraid of a cripply old man in a wheelchair who can't even face you, are you?
What'd he say?
He said that you were a horse molester.
He say what horse?
What, are you hidin'?
The great Wild Bill Hickok is actually inside hidin'?
- (man) What's this?
- (man #2) Wild Bill in a wheelchair!
Needless to say, Bill, all good fortune.
I never saw a greater compliment to Bill
than that paid
by the citizens of Cheyenne.
Their confidence in his marksmanship
was such that none of them ran for cover,
but lined up as if they were watching
some athletic contest.
- A whisky, please. Neat.
- You ain't gonna go out and watch this?
I don't think my friend needs my help.
I generally stay in the bar when he gets involved with this sort of affair.
You just help yourself, cos I ain't gonna miss it.
Here's to you, Bill.
This dispute had begun two years before,
when one Ed Plummer had called Bill out.
Some said the reason
was a gambling debt.
Others claimed that it involved a woman.
Bill discovered that the Plummers
regarded the affair as a family matter.
Argh! My leg!
I can't move my leg!
Aaargh!
Damn it, Will Plummer. I already shot you once when you tried to bushwhack me.
You hear that? The man is accusing me.
Imagine that.
Have you forgotten, Mr Hickok, that I am the aggrieved party here?
You must be drunk or gone crazy, Will.
Now, if you got any sense left, you'll just head on home.
No, no. You're not gonna get off that easy.
You took the life from my brother.
And you left me a crippled old man in a wheelchair.
You, sir, will die!
Mister, Wild Bill just shot Will Plummer dead.
Then he told me to come ask you if you'd mind to get the lead out of your ass... sir... and come outside and help untie him.
Will Plummer, rest in peace.
We owe God a death.
Bill chose to move on to the town
that was the talk of the entire West.
DEADWOOD GULCH,
DAKOTA TERRITORY, AUGUST 1876
Gold had been discovered a year before.
"Get rich quick" was in the air.
From raw wilderness, suddenly up came
this hell-roaring place called Deadwood.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You, uh, haul our bags over to the tent city.
Tell 'em to find room for Bill Hickok and a friend.
How are the eyes, Bill?
Going to be a lot of strangers in this town.
Ah, I can see OK straight ahead.
The sides are narrowin' in, and it hurts.
Comes and goes, but hurts like hell when it's on you.
This town. I really think it's like something out of the Bible.
- What part of the Bible?
- The part right before God gets angry.
(whooping and cheering)
Deadwood was a haven
for cardsharps, con men,
thieves, killers, roughs, drunks,
pimps and whores...
along with those arbiters of disputes:
Whip, fist, knife and pistol.
These two fellers must have caused some trouble.
No trouble, just a couple of card cheats.
That's the worst kind of feller.
Man that cheats at cards ain't got no religion.
Howdy, Jane.
Howdy, Bill.
Boys! This here is James Butler Hickok.
(cheering and whooping)
Everybody to the bar!
Drinks are on Bill!
Wild Bill. Carl Mann.
Pleased to meet you. This here's my place, Mann's Number 10.
Make it your personal headquarters.
What kind of whisky do you favour?
Well, Carl, I prefer it in a glass.
Other than that, it's all good.
- That's the great Hickok?
- Sure as hell is.
He'll buy you a drink, shake your hand, and you can tell your grandkids about it.
Charles Prince, of London, New York and parts west, friend of Wild Bill's.
I know you're Calamity Jane.
He's spoken of you many times.
Joe!
Half a grand howdy, pard!
The whole town's crazy. Every polecat in the territory's looking for gold.
They ain't even got a sheriff yet.
I figure I'll nominate you for the job.
- Wild Bill?
- (Joe) They got varmints here that...
What are you doing?
Wild Bill, I'm talkin' to you.
You'd better look out when you walk down the street in this town.
You listen careful to every sound.
I come here to kill you.
He's not wearing a gun, Bill.
The man that kills Wild Bill is gonna be awful famous.
(laughter)
You come here to kill me?
Let me give you some advice.
If you have to shoot a man, you shoot him in the guts.
Might not kill him.
Sometimes they die slow.
But it'll paralyse his brain, and the fight's as good as over.
Why don't you shoot the little snot?
At least rough him up some.
- He's just a dumb-ass kid.
- I got...
You son of a bitch!
- How you been, Bill?
- Middlin'. Just middlin'.
I ain't seen you in two, maybe three years.
Well, I'm still here.
- How you been?
- Well, I'm still here too.
Lots of towns, lots of camps.
Good to see you, Jane.
I like seeing old friends.
It's just for old times' sake.
- You wipin' it off?
- No. I'm rubbin' it in.
You can see me about as much as you want. I guess that's always been the case.
I'm just a little too available.
I gotta be available too. Awful lot of people want a piece of Wild Bill.
Let's have us a card game and a drink.
Outta my way, boys.
As Bill played cards
and drank whisky on into the night,
Deadwood proceeded with its own
forced levity and bizarre behaviour.
The Dakota Dance Hall was
the preferred site for assignations.
This was no rude crib or flimsy shack.
It featured papered walls,
comfortable furniture,
polished spittoons,
and a piano that was actually in tune.
You don't touch me. I saw what you were doing. I don't like it.
Maybe you oughta.
You picked the wrong one, cos I don't care.
Ow! Owww!
Ow! My ear!
Are they shakin'? My hands?
Are they shakin'?
This your first time?
I'm showin' you
Wild Bill don't scare me none.
He's right over there in the Number 10.
- How come you're after Wild Bill?
- I got personal reasons.
- What'd you say your name is, anyhow?
- Lurline.
Lurline Newcomb from Lawrence,
Kansas. But I been all over.
I bet you have.
I kinda like that name Lurline.
You were talking about Dave McCandless.
- You were sayin' of McCandless, Bill?
- He wasn't sayin' a goddamn thing.
Yo？keep nosin' that around along with
Dave Tutt and how he took Bill's watch, and them soldiers beat him half to death in Hays City.
- I heard you killed seven men, Bill.
- He didn't have no reputation before that.
He just drove freight wagons.
It happened at Rock Creek Station.
Bill was taken with a woman kept by the outlaw and horse thief McCandless.
Her name was Sarah.
McCandless and his bunch, ten men in all, rode up lookin' to settle things.
Inside the station, Bill seen an old buffalo gun. He wasn't sure it would shoot.
McCandless yelled
"We know you're in there, and you've breathed your last breath for messin' with my girl!"
Wild Bill was shot and cut bad when they laid on him, but he met 'em shootin', stabbin', shoutin', hackin'.
He kicked and bit and kneed 'em down till the air was blue with smoke and the floor was wet with blood.
Ten men lay dd his  dyin', and his boots was fillin' with the blood of 16 wounds.
He thanked God and walked out into the blindin' light before he fell over, and that all happened July 12, 1861.
You can look it up.
I think it was maybe five killed.
- Are you all right, Bill?
- I'm fine, Charley.
I just need me some night air.
- Now, what set him off?
- Five men, Bill?
Well, hell, I thought it was seven!
The young kid stole a horse, somebody said the Chinaman looked the wrong way at a white woman, and the Indian was in town tradin' when we got the word about Custer.
We're gonna hang them all on Saturday.
In the Chinese section of Deadwood,
there was generally available
a remedy for the restless spirit.
Bill was susceptible to its application.
(in Chinese) Take it.
Afterwards, you'll have good dreams.
It will take you to a special place.
Dog soldiers. Cheyenne.
(speaks Cheyenne)
He said you saw a little dog. Um...
Can't make much sense out of it.
They followed your tracks.
Did the little dog speak to you?
The little dog's special medicine, sacred.
No! It's mine!
I'll kill you!
Argh! God!
Tell them I spoke to the little dog.
(speaks Cheyenne)
Tell them the little dog took me to a holy place, then it disappeared.
(Joe speaks Cheyenne)
Then we went to the other world.
Tell them the little dog told me that I was blessed. I'd live a long life.
(speaks Cheyenne)
Says you're a damn fine liar.
Says you saved yourself and your friends for today.
But if he catches you killin' any buffalo or takin' hides, the Cheyenne'll kill you.
What'd he tell you, Joe?
He said the next time you saw the little dog, you wouldn't live to see another moon.
(footsteps)
You OK, Bill?
I'm fine. No need to worry.
I damn well did get all concerned.
Nobody knew where you'd got to.
Had a hell of a time findin' where you'd been.
Maybe I drank a little too much last night.
Had me some dreams.
Had too much on that Chinese pipe.
You're lookin' mighty peaked.
You wanna tell me what you was dreamin' about?
About me and California Joe.
Things we did when we come across some Indians on a buffalo hunt six, seven years back.
What things? Bad things?
You know, they say sometimes a dream might be a foretellin'.
Wasn't just a dream, it was a fact.
Gimme some room, Jane.
I gotta clear my head.
You ain't the same, Bill.
- How's that?
- I don't know.
You just... got kinda different from before is all.
Maybe. I don't know.
You got a bathhouse in this town?
Sure could use one.
Howdy.
- What you doin' here?
- Maybe I'm just bein' friendly.
It ain't that I don't appreciate it.
I just got a lot of things to do today.
- What things?
- Weigh up my methods.
I'm gonna stir up old Wild Bill.
You'd better listen to me, because I know where your Mr Wild Bill was last night.
One of them Chinese girls told an upstairs girl that told me that he went down to Song Lew's and had himself a pipe.
You tell your friend, next time he goes in there, tell me about it.
I'll make it worth her while. Yours, too.
You know, you can move all your plunder into my room if you want.
It's the first room at the top of the stairs.
Maybe I'd better stay on out at the tent city.
What's the problem?
No problem.
I think it just might be best if I stay out...
You got yourself some new gal?
I just ain't in the mood.
Well, you must have got yourself some new gal.
You know, I don't ever remember askin' to be the only thing in your life, or you in mine, for that matter.
But what we had was kinda special, and I don't see why we can't have it now, so I would just like some kind of goddamn explanation. You owe me that much.
I don't owe nobody nothin'.
I don't explain myself.
Not to you, not to some punk-ass kid!
Not to nobody!
Now, just run along and leave me be.
Sure thing.
And to hell with you, Mr Wild Bill!
In truth, Bill felt some remorse
for his argument with Jane.
But it was the nature of their friendship
that feelings for one another go unstated.
Typical for a man of action,
Bill found romance
the most perplexing aspect of his life.
Bill! Look what I got! This damn kid!
People said bring him. I bringed him!
(laughter)
Well, look what we got here. I'd stick him in the manure bin if I was you, Joe.
Take him around back and shoot him.
He's makin' all kinds of trouble, Bill.
Skunk stuff, all of it.
Insulted some ladies, broke some china over to the store.
He even claims that you told him to do it!
Here. You see to the damage.
- What name do you go by?
- Jack McCall.
Joe, cut his ropes.
Hear you been misbehavin', Jack.
What's the problem between me and you?
I don't like the way you treated my ma.
How you done whatever then you left her.
She kept track of you. She had lots of stories from newspapers, dime novels.
I told her she should write you.
She said you wouldn't answer no letter.
- Who was she?
- A decent lady.
Miss Susannah Moore.
Greetings, Jack.
Charles Prince, friend of Bill's.
Could be that Wild Bill's made a few mistakes over the years, but...
Well, it's understandable. But past is past.
Shut up, Charley.
Yeah, shut up, Charley.
I planned killin' you from the time I found out the man that ruined my ma was a great hero to the country.
I'm gonna give you a chance in life, Jack.
I don't wanna kill nobody so young and confused about things.
Joe, get him a horse, would you?
Put him on it and point him east.
East is where fellers like him oughta live, but my recommendation is still to kill him.
I liked your ma. She was a good, fine woman. Awful pretty.
This here's been a real pleasure, Mr Hickok.
Not a word to your mother.
I don't wanna cause her no trouble.
She's dead six months.
I've been on your trail ever since.
(thunderclap)
It's gonna take some stitches.
That's what you get for actin' ornery.
Everybody in town's heard how the great
Wild Bill knocked you around. Hold still.
Now, you just don't worry about it none.
I accomplished my purposes.
The rumour of Jack McCall's purpose
had spread through Deadwood.
The circumstances called for a killing.
There would be no shortage of killers
to heed the summons.
You're Jack McCall?
- Whatever it is, I ain't interested.
- I'm Donnie. Donnie Lonigan.
I figure you and me got things to talk about.
- That right? Where you from, Donnie?
- New York. Came here to find the gold.
- Had a bad run of luck.
- Who's your friend?
Jubal Pickett. Pleased to meet you.
I say just throw 'em out, Jack.
They just look to be street trash.
A five-dollar whore's gonna tell me about street trash?
Oh, now.
Donnie, let's be polite.
How can I help you fellers?
We heard you're gonna be paying to kill a man.
You hears wrong.
You gonna do it by yourself, Jack?
All alone?
I doubt you ever even shot a feller.
Bill Hickok. He'd be at least a thousand dollars.
He's a two-gun plainsman.
And in addition, he carries a derringer in his vest pocket as a hide-out.
He's killed at least 20 people. That's not countin' what he done in the war.
I got three more fellers that work for me.
They like to take chances for money.
Well, I ain't there yet, Donnie, but you boys stay in touch.
Well, hallelujah. Let's lift up our hands tonight and praise the Lord. Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! How I love the Lord!
I love him, because he is able!
I love him, because he reached down and he pulled me right from the gutters of sin!
I love him, because when sin and sickness had me bound, he reached out.
He washed me in his precious blood.
Oh, hallelujah. And I am here to testify tonight that it is my determination!
I will hold on! I will hold on to the rock that is my salvation!
I will hold on to the word of God!
I will hold on to him!
Oh, yes, Satan, you can't touch me now!
Come on, you dirty devil!
I said you can't touch me now!
Oh, hallelujah.
Lift up your hands. Praise the Lord.
Hallelujah. Praise him.
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
- Who's that feller?
- Yankee. Name of Bill Hickok.
He's awful dashin', ain't he? They say he was spyin' around here during the war.
- He's lookin' at you.
- Look all he wants, won't do no good.
I bet he comes over and asks you to dance.
- I won't dance with no Yankee.
- I thought you was a loyal Union woman.
I am. My dead husband wasn't.
He'd be rollin' in his grave if I was dancin' with some Yankee feller.
I knew it. Here he comes.
It ain't gonna do no good. I didn't come here to meet up with Yankee strangers.
You look like the prettiest girl around.
I was wonderin' if you wanna dance.
Surely.
You comin' with me?
I just think you're lyin'.
I ain't lyin'. I'll take you on up to Springfield.
You had your way, and you want to again, and you'II...
I'll take you on up to Springfield, and that kid of yours, too.
I bet you have your way with lots of girls.
Bet you tell 'em all a whole pack of lies.
I ain't lyin'.
But I would if I couldn't figure no other way with you.
(in Chinese) He has had two pipes.
He is a famous man.
I know. He has killed many.
He has had many fights.
Howdy, Bill.
- Dave.
- What brings you back to these parts?
I spent the last six months scoutin' for the army. Figured I'd come back here, see the sights, see my old friends.
I hope you ain't figurin' on startin' back up with Miss Susannah Moore.
Got tired of waitin' on you, took up with somebody else.
Who'd that be, Dave?
That'd be me, Bill.
She took up with me.
Be seein' you around.
(tinkly tune)
- Dave?
- Hm?
Where'd you get that watch?
Goddammit, how many times I told you to stop botherin' me about things?
I recognise it. It's Bill's, ain't it?
His daddy gave him this watch.
You sure never took it off him.
Yeah? Well, I never said
I did that neither, did I?
Then how'd you get it?
Card game last night.
You walk around town wearin' this watch, he'll kill you.
Say, pard.
You seen old Dave Tutt today?
I sure have.
He's right over across the way.
Tell me, friend, is he wearing my watch?
I really couldn't say.
Well...
By God, Bill, I'm glad to see you could make it out today.
You know, this ain't about no timepiece, Bill.
You know it... and I know it.
He called it.
Whole damn thing didn't have to happen.
I come here for Wild Bill.
I don't want nobody interferin' none.
(speaks angrily in Chinese)
You ain't gonna slow me down none.
(speaks Chinese)
This is your time, Wild Bill.
Make your move, Jack.
We'll both go.
Hm! (speaks Chinese)
(bell tolling)
(Jack)
I've been thinkin' about you, Donnie.
I've been thinkin' a man has to seize his opportunities where he finds them.
I tried last night, but I fell short of my mark.
Now, you're a lot rougher feller than I am, ain't you, Donnie?
You and your boys here are real capable.
And you've found your greatest opportunity right here in Deadwood.
The most famous gunfighter in all the world.
- He's gettin' old.
- He is for a fact.
But, uh, the sight of him in the street, well, it could make a young feller shake.
He don't make me shake.
How much money are we talkin'?
You called it before, Donnie. $1,000.
Here she is.
$250 now, $250 when we meet tonight, the other half when it's done.
Want it or not?
(speaks Chinese)
(slurps)
I thank you for your kindness.
Wild Bill.
Maybe you can help me.
Where the hell did things go wrong?
This kid,
Miss Jane, trouble with my eyes.
You don't understand a blessed word
I'm sayin', do you?
(imitates slurping)
I had him. I had him right there in front of me.
All I had to do was pull the trigger.
You ask yourself why you didn't?
I don't know.
Maybe I was enjoyin' the moment too much, or... (chuckles)
...maybe I ain't got the nerve.
Tie the knot right there, would you? A bow knot or something that'll slip real easy.
I guess this is fare thee well between you and me.
Come tonight, I either see him dead and be on the run... or he'll kill me dead like all them others.
You've come this far.
That's already buckin' the odds.
Maybe you'll just go all the way.
(snores)
Break the seal on that bottle there, would you, Carl?
Bill!
It's surely good to see you. Uh-huh.
Where you been, Bill? I thought maybe that kid scared you outta town.
Would you find that help of yours and tell him to go across to Jensen's barn, tell them to have a horse ready?
I'm headin' out come dawn.
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it myself.
- D'you eat your supper?
- Wasn't hungry.
Now, that don't sound right to me.
Mm-mm.
You got to learn to take better care of yourself.
Where the hell'd everybody go? There's not a damn person out there in the street.
There's a new gold strike 30 miles west of here. Real gargantua.
Whole town rushed off this morning.
You stayed?
Maybe I was worried about you, Bill.
Ain't damn likely.
Joe and Charley hung around too.
Nobody knew where you'd been holed up.
If you're lookin' for them, they're upstairs sleepin' in the flop room.
Had me another bad dream on the Chinese pipe.
- Things are comin' back to haunt me.
- I figured it was somethin' like that.
You got to stay away from that stuff.
Stick with whisky.
Go on, now. Drink that.
It's real good for you.
Mmm. Good, right?
Yeah. Thanks.
(horse whinnies)
Now, I want you all to listen to me.
We're gonna ride out past the Number 10 down to Jensen's barn.
I don't want anybody suspicious of our horses out front.
- You OK, Jack?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Been waitin' for this for a real long time.
He had found
the band of jackals he needed.
But as Jack McCall rode through town,
he experienced the terrifying certainty
that a man faces when he is
about to make his own name famous.
He lacked both a hero's calm, and
a coward's resolve to survive at any price.
(Bill) I have to admit, there's something about this kid that spooks me.
Must be his ma.
She was one hell of a damn fine woman.
She could talk good, drink, tear off a piece...
I had a lot of good times with Miss Susannah Moore.
I'd like us to be in love like you and Susannah Moore.
She was the one, wasn't she?
The one you loved most of all.
That's why this kid's got a hold to you.
She was young and pretty, and it was before you was the great Wild Bill.
And you loved her as close as you ever did anybody, in an innocent kinda way.
Ain't that right?
Yeah, I suppose.
(riffles cards)
That's the way
I'd like you to feel about me.
Ain't it a sweet thought?
I think it's a very sweet and fine thought.
Didn't ever come real good till I met you.
- Now, why do you think that is?
- I don't know precisely.
I always reckoned I knew you better than them others.
You've been around lots.
This pain in my eyes, that's all I think about.
It comes and goes.
Your little... charm, it distracts me.
You and me, we had our time in Cheyenne, didn't we? Hm?
We had something kinda special for a while.
Yeah. Listen to us, talking about our pleasures.
Mm. As if they mattered a damn.
All this love talk, I got me a hard-on.
You wanna see?
Surely.
You know, I'm just an ordinary fellow.
I don't want nobody thinkin' more than that. It's all a bother to me.
This thing happens when I spend a night or two with no sleep, too much whisky, no food.
I get easy. Don't know that I should.
Oh, hush now, Bill.
Don't fight it none.
(player piano plays
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic")
Love you, Bill.
Right now I love you too, Jane.
Maybe we'd just better get on with it, hm?
? And his truth goes marchin' on
Hey!
Move easy or I kill you both.
Now get off her!
You inconsiderate bastard.
Get those guns in a tote sack and head upstairs, see who's there.
Let's do it. Let's shoot the son of a bitch.
I'm thinkin'.
Don't hurry me none.
- Excuse me whilst I pull up my pants!
- Upstairs.
Don't want no back of the head shot like Mr Lincoln.
Give me that pocket gun you keep in there.
Hey! Would you mind avertin' your eyes?
I'm a little exposed here.
Donnie!
Goddammit! A Negro.
Just a gun-sharp.
Don't mind my colour. I make a livin'.
You ungrateful son of a bitch.
I almost got my ass shot off 20 times tryin' to free your type during the war!
That was mighty white of you, Wild Bill.
Bill! The horses'll be ready at...
Aw, shit.
Who the hell are you?
I don't think these are gentlemen we should challenge, Joe.
They look a bit on the rough and boorish side, possibly even dangerous.
What are we waitin' for?
Let's get this done.
I told you I wanted to think things through.
I kinda enjoy the great man bein' captured like he is.
You lose your nerve?
We've been here long enough.
- Well, play cards.
- You reckon we're really gonna do this?
You deserted my ma and left her unacknowledged.
Then you shot and killed the only man that coulda made her happy.
Your ma always knowed
I might have to leave.
She enjoyed our little time together, just like I did.
Then how come you promised you were gonna be like a father to me?
That's a mighty evil thing to tell a young widow.
Now, you see, Jack, that's the way it is with men and women.
Lots of times, men make some promises, then take their pleasures and move on.
- Jane, play cards.
- Now, on the other side of the ledger, you ought to understand that when a woman finally surrenders to a man, she's usually got him just about where she wants him.
I'd love to go do my toilette,
s'il vous pla顃?
Sit back down.
- Bill?
- You can sit a minute.
I do believe I will.
Count me in, boys.
What if I could persuade Wild Bill to let you go?
Erase the shadow that he has cast over you.
Apologise.
Go drown in crap, Charley.
I don't know why this matters to me, except that I'd miss Bill's company.
But every time there is a death of a hero, we are all the less.
It drags down morale. People get anxious, depressed, drink more, fight more, causing more killings, till the general uncertainty destroys whatever useful or good remains.
Jack, with luck, and rough cunning, you've got maybe 40 years to rid yourself of Wild Bill and learn the value of simple things.
Fall in love with some pretty girl and learn to cultivate your talents.
Is this your college education that makes you dribble on so?
Oh, come on, Bill.
You can let this kid go.
Apologise for wrongs, real and imagined?
Shake hands, have a drink?
You'll need all the friends you can get when your eyes get worse.
I don't apologise.
See, he figures whatever he done, even if it wasn't perfect, was justifiable.
Well, you see, Jack.
Even if Bill won't do anything but die restless, trying the patience of his friends, maybe you could let him go.
Forgive him.
And move on.
He's the one captured here.
Well... I've said my piece.
You rotten bastard!
OK, Charley. Come on.
Come on. I got you.
Charley had him some mighty interesting cards here.
There you go. Come on, sugar.
Carl, give me a rag or somethin'.
There ain't even a Chinaman out there.
There isn't much change.
I expect she could see a visitor, though.
She has her screaming fits now and then, but most times she's normal.
I knew her family down in Arkansas.
Her momma's from Yell County.
The boy's been boarded out.
He's roomin' up the road there at the James place.
- Our women ain't very pretty, are they?
- They look mostly hungry.
Probably are. The state's had us on mush and molasses for months.
You shouldn't have come.
You got nothin' to be ashamed about.
The woman, she says you're normal.
That's what she says. Normal.
You act right, they'll let you out.
- I'll make 'em do it.
- No. I'll get outta here.
Don't you worry about that.
I just went through a bad time is all.
Lost my husband, lost you, lost Dave.
You come into my life...
I thought you was the dashin' stranger that was gonna change everything, make it all fine.
And you did.
It was all real fine for a while.
The best I ever knew, about.
I even thought you was gonna be a real good daddy to my son.
But then you went off, and... when you come back, it was gone. The special feeling was gone.
Go on your way.
I got my boy.
He'll take care of me.
I'll get outta here, and he'll take care of me, and I'll take care of him.
Go on your way now, Bill.
You gonna do it?
You gonna shoot Wild Bill?
I just gotta get the time right in my head.
@f 鯮u're gonna finish Bill, just get to it.
I killed two men in my life.
I never made no goddamn circus out of it!
I didn't know no ladies killed.
I was defendin' myself against unnatural advances.
Well, pard, looks like you've come to a messy end, no size to it.
Don't seem right for the great Wild Bill, but it don't seem like nothin' can be done.
So I figure, Jack, since all this makes no difference to Bill, kill him quick and don't apologise.
You're gonna go to hell, Joe.
It'd be a kindness to have your company, but I'm just tryin' to get it over with.
Kill him.
Make sure you do it clean.
Don't prolong it.
Just kill him! Let's get it done.
Everybody says kill you.
Ain't their concern. It's yours and mine.
Now, listen.
I have here one hell of an idea.
You just give me the pistol, n her,ard slug in her,
I'll blow my own damn brains out, save you the trouble!
Yes, let him kill himself.
He's been doing it all his life.
Give me the gun!
I left one slug in there. I'm gonna stand back so you can fire when ready.
You wanna say goodbye?
Sure.
Goodbye, Jack.
I got you that time, Wild Bill.
Now this is it.
I can't.
For Christ's sake!
I couldn't do it last night in the
Chinese flophouse, and I can't do it now.
Cos I done it already.
Like the Bible says, I done it in my heart.
I killed you already.
How about I do it?
The man who kills Wild Bill will be very famous.
Especially when he hangs for it.
Could you just jump over the bullshit?
Let's get outta here.
Be seein' you around, Wild Bill.
Maybe next time I won't be workin' for no chickenshit kid.
Come on, let's go.
Well, at last I can do my toilette.
We got your guns! Anybody come outside before we're gone, there will be a killin'!
Bill!
You all best stay in here.
Gimme one of them Colts, Bill.
Can't do it, Joe. I'm a better pistol shot than you with either hand.
How are the eyes, Bill?
Never can tell, Charley.
It comes and goes.
The theatre of Bill's life
had come to demand
that he walk up
the centre of a muddy street
rather than use the boardwalk.
He had discovered being Wild Bill
was a profession in its own right.
(horses fretting)
You oughta know better than to touch another man's hat.
Get him!
Come here, Jack.
Give me my pocket gun back.
I'm lettin' you live.
A sentimental gesture in honour of your mother. Now get on outta here.
Thank you, Mr Hickok, sir.
Uh...
Mind if I have me a drink afore I leave?
I'll buy you one. Whisky's good for a man.
Helps you see things in perspective.
(Joe) Whisky and cards.
The Lord does provide.
Ohh!
I've been up here 20 minutes cryin' my eyes out, and none of you bastards would come up and tell me what happened!
- Bill killed 'em, killed 'em all.
- I don't expect decent treatment from Bill, but I figured a gent like Charley would come upstairs and tell a lady!
I knew if I told you that Bill was alive, you'd be mad at him again.
- What's he doin' here?
- (Joe) Bill's buyin' him a drink.
Go on there and drink your drink and then head on outta town!
Else I'll be the one to put a bullet in ya!
Yes, ma'am.
You ain't no kinda man at all.
You're just some kinda fool.
This whole thing's been too damn crazy, Bill!
You've always been able to do whatever you want, and we don't matter!
- None of us! Ever!
- Hush up now.
I'm concentratin' on my cards.
I like this view over here better, boys.
And I'm gonna like you a whole lot better when you've passed on!
That way I can just say I loved you and I don't have to explain it none! (sobs)
Come on, deal 'em up, Joe.
My luck's runnin'.
You remember them soldiers in Hays City, Bill?
(Charley) He remembers every fight he was ever in. He loves them all.
(Bill) Goddamn soldiers!
Never liked them, any of them.
Never liked bein' one, neither.
Wasn't cut out for the army life.
Never liked eastern bastards, neither.
One time Bill says to his deputy,
Mike Williams, he says...
This is in Abilene. Bill says "I don't want you mixin' in this, cos this is my affair."
"It's just between me and this feller
Phil Coe, who stole my watch."
Dave Tutt stole my watch.
Then Bill waded into this mob of drunks, sharps, whores, mental deficients, all of 'em friends of the great Texas gunfighter, Phil...
Phil Coe. Another one of them bullshit
Texans. Never much liked any of 'em.
Mean sons of bitches, usually cheat at cards, never take a bath.
Bill says "Phil Coe, I'm arrestin' you, because you went and committed a murder."
All of a sudden Phil Coe pulls a drop on Bill, who was too quick for him and gunned him down with two shots, the second one breakin' his spine.
He deserved it.
And that ain't the way it happened.
Then Bill heard footsteps runnin' behind him.
He turns and fires, and accidentally kills his own deputy, Mike Williams.
Then he tells the crowd to clear the streets - which they done - and he stands there and cries over the body.
Nothin' like that ever happened.
It was windy. The dust got in my eyes.
Then there was the time
Bill fought them soldiers in Hays City.
A whole platoon of bluecoats from the 7th Cavalry took him on over a chance remark about a woman Bill was seein'.
Bill's great fights always involved a woman one way or another.
It was the only time the great Wild Bill took off his guns.
Them soldiers damn near killed him with their fists and boots.
Only the miracle of the bartender, one Tommy Drum, who gave Bill back his firearms, saved the day.
Sendin' you home, Wild Bill.
No!
Jack McCall was hanged March 1 st, 1877,
for the murder of James Butler Hickok,
known as Wild Bill.
Like a city in the Old Testament,
Deadwood had become
a place of prophecy and visions.
Bill was 39 years old when he died.
I'm proud to say I was his friend.

50 feet north of the wagon.
Or was it 50 feet south of the wagon?
I can't remember.
You ain't gonna take my gold.
No, sir!
Asshole.
I'm gonna kill you, bitch.
Damn you!
Don't you leave me here. I'm gonna kill you if I ever see you again.
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!
MARSHAL
5'8". Am I right?
I ain't ever wrong.
That's a girl. Thanks.
- How about a room?
- Whores next door.
- Say that again.
- Whores next door.
Now, do you have a room available?
A room and bath.
Yes, ma'am. Coming up.
Katie, let's go get the lady a room and a bath.
Barkeep,
I want a bottle of champagne.
And don't you dare open it.
I want to know what I'm drinking.
- You want to play poker with me?
- You keep playing with yourself.
This is a very special pack.
I put an ace in it every time I kill a man.
Interested in first-class whisky?
Fine cigars, Indian ink, or perfume?
Just shine my boots.
John Herod owns that house. He gets
50 cents of every dollar in town.
- What does the town get?
- They get to live.
Another gun in town.
Hi, Scars.
Stand back.
That makes... 15.
- I just got out of prison.
- Congratulations.
- I got 35 years, but got out early.
- How long did you do this time?
Three days.
- You're pretty.
- You're not.
- I need a woman.
- You need a bath.
I'm so clumsy, I must be blind.
- We prayed you'd come to help us.
- This is strictly business.
- These candelabras are worth $200.
- That's not good enough.
Is that it?
Don't mind my daddy.
He's just stupid.
You look like you've been riding a long time. Where are you from?
Are you here for the contest?
I've never seen a woman carry a gun.
If you're a good shot, maybe you could...
I guess I'd better go now.
Gold teeth!
I've got all sizes. Gold teeth.
I've got uppers. I've got lowers.
You're wasting my time.
Quiet!
I now declare the quick-draw competition open.
Each man who enters the contest will fight once a day.
Anybody can challenge anybody.
Fight times to be drawn from a hat.
For the duration of the contest -
- fighters are entitled to whatever they want, courtesy of Mr. Herod.
But the man who wins the contest gets this...
Compliments of Mr. Herod and Wells-Fargo.
All right, gentlemen, what do you say?
Do we have any real gunmen in this room?
- Do we?
- Yes.
Gutzon.
- I am the Swedish champion.
- Mr. Gutzon is the first to go up.
Anyone else?
- Put an ace up there for me.
- Ace Hanlon.
You'd better put me and my friend Eugene on the list.
I ain't joining no contest.
Did I hear a clucking? Did somebody bring a chicken in here?
- I'll kill you with my bare hands.
- No, it's a gunfight.
We aim, we fire, you die.
You'll get the idea.
The fighting begins tomorrow.
- Put my name up there.
- Anybody else?
- Sergeant Cantrell.
- How do you spell that?
Correctly.
- Anyone else?
- Spotted Horse.
Many white men will leave this town in wooden boxes.
Spotted Horse. Any others?
- Put my damn name up.
- Scars.
I'm worth $3,000 in four states.
75 offences and no convictions.
My name's Fee... but everyone calls me The Kid.
Congratulations.
I can wake up at dawn, rob two banks, a train, a stagecoach, -
- shoot the feathers off a duck's ass at 300 feet, -
- and be back in bed before you wake up next to me. How are you?
- Just fine.
- Virgil Sparks, the pride of Texas.
Horace said you drink this.
You sure must want to die young.
I do now.
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.
- How many brave men do we got?
- 12, Mr. Herod.
13 if you count Foy, but he and Ratsy aren't back yet.
They'll be here. They're just running a little errand for me.
- Add my name to the list.
- Yes, sir.
- We beat the hell out of him.
- He ain't nothing.
Hello, Cort. I was beginning to worry you wouldn't make it in time.
It's been a while. I hear you have a mission down in Hermosillo.
Is that right?
Your own little piece of heaven.
Sunshine, cactus flowers and you and the orphan children.
We burned that mission down, just like you said.
All that work, Cort...
All those years of hard work destroyed for no reason.
It must make you angry.
You used to be fast.
Are you still fast?
Don't I get an answer?
Have you taken a vow of silence?
I said, are you still fast?
Faster than you.
But I have renounced violence.
We'll see.
String him up.
In here, on the chair.
Adjust your collar, Reverend.
Pull him up, Foy.
Let me make it clear...
I want you in that contest.
No.
Think about it.
Last chance.
- Yes or no?
- Go to hell.
Sign me up.
- No women in quick-draw.
- There's no rules against ladies.
It's just that women can't shoot for shit.
Adios, Reverend.
Put 'em both in the contest.
Move it, Preacher.
Take him out by the trough.
- Come back here.
- No!
Come back here! You hear me?
Daddy!
Good morning. You definitely had a good time last night.
Want some breakfast? Or how about some more of what we had last night?
You certainly won that drinking contest.
But then again, I won you in poker.
You puked and passed out, so let's not plan the wedding yet.
- Why do you sleep on this thing?
- That way nobody will steal it.
DYNAMITE
- Who are you gonna challenge today?
- Herod.
Bad idea. I'm the only guy who can take him and I ain't gonna rush it.
- Why not?
- Hell, he's my father.
Have you been challenged yet?
You have now. I'll go get us a time.
These are my boys.
They don't get to church much.
Daddy's gonna kill you, Preacher.
- Sleep well?
- Not as well as you.
- I saved your life last night.
- You just stretched it out a bit.
- I might already be in heaven.
- Sorry.
- Don't you even want to fight back?
- Of course I do.
I'd like to kill them all for what they've done... but I won't.
- Killing people is wrong.
- Some people deserve to die.
It was a little lean this week.
The whisky was flat.
Horace, your excuses are getting worse every week.
I took everything out of the register, sir.
- That's all there was.
- Barkeep...
I challenge you...
- I'm not fighting you.
- You ain't got no choice.
- I told you!
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here for the money.
The rules say you have to accept every challenge.
If you've got a problem with that, get out of town.
- I've got no problem.
- The lady fights Mr. Kelly.
They fight at seven o'clock tonight.
- Pick a card, honey.
- Thank you.
He's so hot.
Hold it up.
Ace of spades.
Thank you.
I heard you blew a little girl's thumb off in Reno doing that.
- I'm the best you'll ever see.
- So I keep hearing.
Shall we find out?
Look, girls, there he is.
It's lights out, Kid.
I'm gonna be pissing on your grave tonight. You're through!
Quiet!
- What's the odds on The Kid?
- Three to one.
Gentlemen, remember, you must not draw -
- until that clock makes the first chime of the hour.
What if somebody gets excited and starts shooting early?
Any cheats will be eliminated from the contest.
Whoever is standing after the draw is the winner.
If both men are still standing, you must continue firing.
Gentlemen, the street is yours.
I'll only wound you, Kid.
You're a kind man.
Damn, am I fast!
Did you even see me, I was so fast?
Mr. Swedish Champion, are you done?
Stay down if you're finished.
Yes, I give up.
- The Kid's the winner.
- Am I fast or is Sweden very small?
Come on, Kid, I'm gonna get you something to drink.
How does it feel, Cort?
Does it remind you of the good old days?
Is your heart beating faster?
Is your pulse racing?
- Good shooting, Kid.
- Good shooting?
If the Swede had been any slower, birds would've nested in his hat.
Come on, Kid.
Spotted Horse cannot be killed by a bullet. See.
Four bullets in my arm, three in my left leg and two in the back.
Another bullet went through my lip.
Another through my left foot.
Today a bullet went into my head and it's not even come out yet!
- It's time.
- I'm not gonna fight.
You don't want to fight?
We'll see about that.
Get up! Come on, don't keep Mr. Herod waiting.
Come on, Preacher, move it.
- Turn the other cheek, Preacher.
- Kick his ass!
He's gonna forgive us all.
And that concludes the lessons for today.
- My nose!
- I'm shocked.
- My nose!
- I'm shocked.
- The reverend needs a gun.
- There's plenty of other gun shops.
- Nowhere as cheap.
- No place is cheap enough for you.
Your mouth gets faster every day.
Pity your hands are so slow.
- I ain't got slow hands.
- Put your hand on the counter.
Put your gun hand on the counter.
See, Cort. Here's a gunfighter's hand, and here's a farmer's hand.
I ain't got a farmer's hand.
Cort and me are killers, the genuine article, but you...
You're from different stock.
My friend here needs a gun.
This is the Eagle-butt Peacemaker.
Solid ivory handle.
Only 30 of these were ever made.
This is the customized
Remington new model.
It's more accurate than the Colt.
The handles are solid silver.
Used with great success on
35 bank robberies by its late owner.
This is the best help a man can get.
A Smith & Wesson Schofield.45.
Me and Jesse James think it's the best handgun in the world.
Trigger guard removal saves drawing time.
But if you're drunk, you'll kill your feet.
- When did you last hold a gun?
- You know when.
I got offered 120 for this Colt.
You want to try it out?
- Have you got $120, Cort?
- I don't have any money.
The Lord provides me with everything I need.
We're wasting this boy's time then.
I'll be a good Samaritan.
What's the cheapest gun you've got?
The cheapest piece of crap you've got in the whole miserable store.
All right...
- Five bucks.
- Sold.
What are you doing?
The Preacher's got the Lord on his side. He only needs one bullet.
Otherwise he might be tempted to shoot his way out of town.
- That gun shoots straight.
- It's okay, I won't draw.
You will. I know you. When it comes down to it, you'll pull the trigger.
I've got money on you, Preacher.
- I've got 20 bucks on you, Foy.
- That's money in the bank, Jimmy.
Preacher boy, you're a dead man.
Bless me, Lord.
Forgive me for my sins.
- He shot me!
- You didn't lay down and die.
You said you weren't gonna fight.
It felt natural, didn't it?
Nice and smooth.
I thought you weren't gonna fight.
You're pretty fast.
I hope I don't have to fight you.
- You have a choice to be here.
- He made you do it.
I was the only one who pulled the trigger.
This ain't much of a town for a preacher.
- I wasn't always a preacher.
- Cort was an outlaw. Like us.
Weren't you?
In fact, he used to ride with me.
Of course, that's all changed now.
He's a man of peace.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Easy...
There was a time when you couldn't tell us apart.
Is that true?
- Is that true?
- Yes.
I should've let you die.
It's yours. Go ahead, take it.
You smell good.
- What are you looking at?
- A dirty old man and a little girl.
This is a business discussion.
I'm offering her a job.
Just make sure you wash wherever he touches you.
One of these days, I'm gonna have to shoot you up real good.
Mr. Hanlon, I wanted to ask you about Indian Wells.
- Did that fight really take place?
- It sure did.
- You gunned down four men?
- I had a gun in each hand.
The truth is
I am just as good with either hand.
You must be the fastest gun in the West... or the biggest liar.
It's a pity you weren't there to find out.
But I was. I was the one who really killed the Terence brothers.
I doubt that a lying chicken-shit like you was even in the same state.
How about that left hand, Ace?
How about that left-handed draw?
Mr. Ace Hanlon, scourge of the sagebrush.
The terror of Tucson.
A bladder full of hot air.
Daddy!
String him up! Put him on a chair.
Daddy!
They're calling for you on the street.
Are you really gonna do it?
What if you get killed?
Then I won't have to answer any more of your dumb questions.
- Miss...
- What?
You can do it.
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.
The last fight of the day.
Fire at the first chime.
You're gonna die now, girl.
You're dead meat.
Look at you. Are you scared?
You're trembling like a leaf.
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.
The lady is the winner.
- Damn!
- Come back here.
Quick-firing resumes tomorrow at noon.
- I think you're great.
- Grow up.
Thanks.
DINNER TONIGHT
JOHN HEROD
Thirsty?
No need to go to all that trouble just for me.
Last night The Kid. Tonight Herod.
You're a busy woman.
- Any man you're not interested in?
- Yeah, you.
You're looking at me and thinking:
We have nothing in common.
But we do. We're both winners.
How do you feel after surviving your first day?
- The same as yesterday.
- No. Your eyes are shining.
You've passed a test.
You feel alive.
I guess it doesn't excite me as much as it does you.
You think I do this contest because it's fun?
Look at this town. These people would kill you for your bootlaces.
This way I get to face my enemies.
They can't shoot me in the back.
- And of course I always win.
- One day your luck will run out.
I don't win because I'm lucky.
Apres vous.
- Why did you come here tonight?
- You invited me.
You could've turned me down.
- I wanted to see what you're like.
- What kind of man am I?
The kind people hate.
I'm not trying to be popular.
The people in this town need me.
I bring a sense of order to their lives.
- Not law, order.
- Like hanging a preacher?
He's no preacher. He's a fraud.
If a man is a killer, that's what he is.
That same man can't tell me it's not in his blood any more.
- He's the worst kind of liar.
- Why does he upset you so much?
I find myself almost uncontrollably attracted to you.
I'd think a man like you would have a woman.
I was married to a beautiful woman.
- She was unfaithful.
- Where is she now?
I told you... she was unfaithful.
- Why are you really here?
- Like I said, for the money.
I'd give you all the money you want.
I wouldn't feel like I'd earned it.
Yes, you would.
- Did you ever kill anyone?
- Sure.
I don't think so. It all comes down to how far you're prepared to go.
All the way.
My father was a judge.
That surprises you.
He used to make my mother and me watch people being hanged.
One day he said there was too much bad in this world.
He took a bullet, put it in his gun and spun the chamber.
Then he took it in turns, clicking it at each of us, -
- until he blew the back of his head off... with the final click.
Understand this: There is nothing on this earth that frightens me now.
- Nothing.
- I have to go.
I shouldn't have come here.
- Who are you?
- Let me go.
I apologize for my behaviour, but it's hard to get a drink round here.
I was only a kid when I hitched up with Herod.
He singled me out because...
...I was a little smarter and a little faster than most.
A completely fearless man, and he wanted me to be just like him.
We used to go revenue collecting along the border, just the two of us.
We took the bank in Nogales... and ran out to a street full of troops.
We got shot up so bad.
This padre hid us in his mission.
He cared for us and fed us.
He talked to us both for hours.
When we were strong enough to ride,
Herod told me to shoot him.
When I said no, -
- he put a gun to my head and started to count down from ten.
So I killed the priest.
It doesn't matter what I do now.
I'm already damned, I know that.
Don't go down that road.
You don't have to become like me.
- Why did you call me up here?
- I wanted to ask you one question.
Who brought you here to fight me?
Mr. Herod...
I'm just a gentleman adventurer after the challenge of a gunfight.
I thought Ace Hanlon was the hired gun. I was so sure of it.
But he was just a buffoon.
You're not.
My name's Clay Cantrell, and I'm a shootist.
I've killed 17 men.
Killing is purely business for me.
It doesn't give me any pleasure.
My employer is confidential.
Do we have business together today?
As soon as the rain stops, I'm going to make an example of you.
Then he said, "Give me the gun."
What could I do? I gave it to him.
Like hell I did.
That was it for Flat Nose Freddy.
He currently resides six feet under.
You were brave to enter the contest.
You've made your point.
Now I want you to step down.
I'll step down when you step down.
I'm telling you to step down.
Your time will come.
Not with you still around.
Don't ever cross me.
And don't try to stare me down like you're doing now.
I'm not sick or old, and you're not half the man I am.
Round two.
Four fights today, featuring the eight remaining contestants.
The winner is the contestant left standing.
Left alive.
Left alive!
From now on, we fight to the death.
What a surprise, John, you changing the rules...
What a surprise, John, you changing the rules...
Any problem with that?
I was planning to kill you anyway.
Gentlemen, the street is yours.
I'm confused.
All I hear from you weak cowards is how poor you are.
How you can't afford my taxes, my protection.
Yet somehow you've all managed to find the money -
- to hire a professional gunfighter to kill me.
Where's all this money coming from?
What am I to think?
If you've got so much to spare,
I'm gonna have to take more off you.
This is my town!
If you live to see the dawn, it's because I allow it.
I'm in charge of everything.
I decide who lives or who dies.
Your gunfighter's dead.
Old news.
Is it possible?
Is it possible to improve on perfection?
The man's dead.
The Kid's the winner.
I heard him.
I heard him move his hand.
People, I am on a different level.
I am the new mayor of this town.
- Wonderful.
- He stinks worse dead.
Storm coming up. No more fights till we see what it's gonna do.
We're gonna have to bury him deep.
He stinks something awful.
Get the hell out of here!
That little girl is gonna be a real good earner.
Deal me in, boys.
- I feel lucky.
- Was she good?
Wriggled like a fish.
Get up!
- Bitch! I'll kill you.
- Outside, you bastard!
You goddamn filthy bitch!
Please, don't kill me.
Finish him off! This contest isn't over until one of you is dead.
Please, don't kill me.
This contest is not over yet.
A drink.
Thank you.
Die!
Gold teeth.
A whole mouthful of gold teeth.
The lady moves to round three.
There's always forgiveness if you ask for it.
Come on, Preacher.
- Thank you, Ratsy.
- Goodbye.
What are you doing?
You're not quitting, are you?
I know this is probably the wrong time...
...but I like you and I want you to stay.
- How can you live like this?
- Live like what?
- Are you going to see Cort's fight?
- No, I'm not.
I don't care about him... or you, or anybody else in this town.
I'm through.
I don't think you heard me right.
I said I liked you.
Spotted Horse cannot be killed by a bullet.
The man's dead.
Cort's the winner.
He killed that Indian.
Spotted Horse cannot be killed by a bullet.
- Give me another bullet.
- I explained the rules to you.
You have to kill the man.
Give me another bullet, John.
Somebody give me a bullet!
.38, Long Colt.
"I shall not kill."
That's what you told me.
- "I have renounced all violence."
- Now!
Congratulations, you're going to the next round, Preacher.
Applause.
Bravo.
Welcome back... killer.
Enough.
Give me that.
- I knew I'd find you here.
- You know who I am?
Of course I do.
I brought you into this world.
- Your father...
- I don't want to talk about it.
You've been hours looking for his grave. He's not here.
Herod's men... they smashed the gravestone I made.
Then they burned his body till there was nothing left.
There are good people here.
They're just cowards... like me.
They're waiting for someone like you to come and stop him.
I can't! I can't kill him!
I had my chance and I was scared.
- I'm scared of dying.
- You've been dead since that day.
You're more scared of living.
It will be the same if you keep riding.
I pulled this from the fire.
He was the best friend I ever had.
String him up. Put him on a chair.
- Say your prayers.
- Here's the rope.
Daddy! No!
Put her down!
Hey, beautiful.
What's wrong with you?
What the hell!
That's Mr. Herod's prisoner.
I hope you don't think I've sunk to some base level of humanity.
The Bible speaks of drawing a sword against evil.
I feel that it must be God's will that I'm here.
So I...
Oh God...
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because we could be dead tomorrow.
Promise me you'll leave Herod for me.
I challenge you.
I'm not fighting anybody else.
I want you.
I've already been challenged.
It's time for me to see if I'm my father's equal.
You would fight your own son.
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Do you have a problem with me?
I'll let you know.
- I'm not fighting you.
- I'm not fighting you.
I came here to kill Herod, and that's what I'm gonna do.
- Stand down.
- I will not.
Stand down and let me take him in the final. He'll be just as dead.
Let me make something clear:
You are going to fight.
Nobody walks out on this contest.
You don't tell me what to do.
If you try to leave town or refuse to fight, my men will kill you.
You had your chance to quit and now it's gone.
Clear the street!
Round three!
Only four contestants left.
Mr. Herod fights The Kid.
Then the lady fights Cort.
Clear the street!
You don't have to do this.
Everybody knows you're the best.
It ain't about that. I'm his son.
If this is the only way he'll admit that...
...then so be it.
What can you get out of this?
What do you want?
All I want is his respect.
I love you.
Drop out. You've made your point.
The gunfight is in the head, not in the hands.
The thing that makes him invincible is that you all think he is.
Maybe five years ago he was the fastest...
...but time catches up with everyone.
He's just a little bit slower than he used to be. As for myself...
I just reached my peak.
Shit, that was fast!
- Did I get him?
- Yeah, Kid, you got him.
Did I kill him?
- You were so fast, Kid.
- I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I know.
It was never proved that he was my son.
It was a farmer that...
He wasn't mine.
I gave him a way out.
He wouldn't take it.
- What kind of ink do you have?
- Any kind you need.
DYNAMITE
If neither one of you fire by the time I count down from ten, -
- my men will gun you down.
Ten... nine...
- Draw your gun. He'll do it.
- Eight.
- Seven.
- Draw!
- Six.
- Kill me, Ellen.
- Five.
- Kill me!
Kill me! Kill me, or I'm gonna kill you.
One!
She's dead.
She's dead! Leave her alone, you vultures. Don't touch her!
Nice shooting, Reverend.
You put a fox in the hen house and you'll have chicken for dinner.
You're gonna burn for this.
Is this what you wanted all along?
Come and get some.
Son of a bitch!
Of course we'll fight, but the rules say tomorrow.
- I'll even let you name the time.
- Dawn.
Break my nose twice?
Now we'll see how fast you can draw.
- Who did that?
- I did that, Mr. Herod.
You've got 20 seconds to get out of town.
That's not fair. I've only ever done what you told me to.
- You now have 15 seconds.
- Goodbye, Ratsy.
What do you think? There's a lot of people here that want entertainment.
I could draw with my left hand.
How does that sound?
Unlike Mr. Ace Hanlon,
I really can fight with both hands.
How do you feel? I'm nervous.
It takes a lot to scare me.
I love the sensation.
Time's up, Ratsy!
I always wanted to fight you, Cort.
Ever since the first time I saw you.
It's just this itch that I had to scratch.
If he's still standing at the end, gun him down.
You're dead! You're dead!
Sorry, John.
Changed the rules.
- From now on all fights are fair.
- Who are you?
You stole my life.
Let her go, you son of a bitch!
Don't make my little girl watch.
Let her go, before you kill me.
I can't do that.
I've had my three shots.
I'll give you three shots to save your daddy's life.
Shoot the rope, and if it breaks, your daddy can live.
You can do it, darling.
- I can't.
- You can do it.
Hold the gun in both hands and pull the hammer back.
- I can't.
- You can. You can do it.
- No, I can't.
- Don't you worry about this.
None of this is your fault.
Don't you blame yourself.
Just remember that your daddy loves you.
I'll always love you...
Just remember that. Now, come on.
That's close enough.
- You're not fast enough for me.
- Today I am.
The law's come back to town.

Hi, Curly.
Remember me?
Mitch Robbins?
I was on your last cattle drive.
Remember? We birthed that calf together.
How you been?
I'm sorry.
That's a stupid thing to say, because...
Why get into that? Why depress you?
Anyway...
I think about you a lot.
You changed my whole life.
You were right, cowboy.
'"One thing.'"
'"Just one thing.'"
City folk.
I buried him alive!
Hello?
Yes!
Hi, Mom.
It's September 8, 1952.
We're driving back from Aunt Marsha's, my water breaks... your father jumps the divider of the Saw Mill River Parkway... and races me to Doctors' Hospital... and at 5:16... out you came.
Happy birthday, darling!
I can't believe you're 40.
I'm overcome. Talk to your father.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, boy. Happy birthday.
Thanks. How are you?
I got a cyst on my testicle.
Here's your mother.
Don't worry, he's fine.
So, how does it feel to be 40?
- Actually, Mom, I feel great.
- Why, what's wrong?
Ma, he's fine. He's never been better.
You're there, too? Hi, Barbara.
Well, listen, you two, have a...
Leo, Leo! The dog needs to go out.
Leo! He's impossible.
- I'm gonna have him neutered.
- She means the dog.
Stop that!
I've got to go, he's peeing on the carpet!
She means Dad.
'Bye, Mom.
'Bye, angel birthday boy.
'Bye.
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks.
Oh, boy!
- What a nightmare.
- They're your parents.
No, not them.
I had a nightmare that was...
I don't want to talk about it... because today is my birthday.
The big 4-0.
And I feel good, I really feel great.
I feel good, yes.
Nurse, today is my birthday.
I'd like to look at the ocean, please.
Thank you.
I'm 40. And you know what?
It's not so terrible.
There's no surprise party, right?
Please, no surprise party?
Abe's wife threw a surprise party, he walked in, they yelled, '"Surprise! '"... and he said, '"Bigger surprise:
I'm having a heart attack! '"
Abe Goodman weighed 400 pounds.
Who are you telling, I was a pallbearer.
I had to help carry that camper he was buried in.
No surprise party.
Just dinner and the movies, you, me, and the kids... then both the kids are going to sleep over at my sister's.
And you and I will have the whole house to ourselves.
All night long.
That's my present to you.
Can I open my present now?
Tonight.
But, look, the little man wants to go to the parade.
Save your strength.
You'll need it.
I love it up here.
I'm so glad we moved out of the city.
- 'Morning!
- Good morning!
Work is good.
I'm just not pushing time anymore.
I'm the boss now and I like it.
- 'Morning!
- 'Morning!
Want to turn back? Come on, let's go.
How will you get into a bathing suit?
Look at you, you weigh 800 pounds.
And don't tell me ThighMaster.
You're so out of shape.
I'm 40 and you're 1.
Look at you.
You're like this big tub of veal or something.
Stay in your lane. Why bump me, Norman?
I saved your life.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be 100 wallets.
Okay, we're back.
I'm Dr. Jeffrey Sanborn.
Emotional pain is as real as physical pain.
Just 'cause you can't see a wound on an X-ray doesn't mean it isn't there.
Remember, I feel your pain.
If you want to talk to me about anything, call 555-HELP.
We're on the phone now with Kenny from New Jersey.
- Kenny? Thanks for waiting.
- That's all right.
Kenny, you said you get extremely depressed at night.
That's when the clothes in my closet come alive.
Excuse me?
Well, not really, it's...
Nighttime's when I'm alone and my mind...
I understand.
I pretend there are friends who come over...
Are these men's or women's clothes?
No, I don't have women's clothes.
They're men's clothes.
None at all?
Hi. Don't forget.
The sales meeting's in 10 minutes.
I want to talk to you about Phil.
Nobody said anything when you gave your friend your old job... though he had no experience in radio or sales...
- I know.
...because you're the boss.
But you said you'd let him go two months ago.
I know.
- He's costing the station money.
- It takes a while.
He's in his office now. He's trying his best.
He's been through a tough time.
He's being cleaned out in his divorce.
He's just down.
Then why are you taking him to the Las Vegas convention?
They'll charge you for excess baggage.
You can't keep putting this off.
Lois, today is my birthday.
Do you know what your present to me is?
Not to talk about this anymore?
Thank you, it's just what I wanted.
We're back with Kenny from New Jersey.
The women you meet, do they say things to make you feel they don't like you?
It's not anything that they say, it's just... an overall feeling I get that they're...
What do you get?
Are you there, Kenny?
Are you all right?
Are the clothes in your closet coming to life?
- What's happening?
- Wrong number.
Speak to me.
Kenny has to go.
He's cooking breakfast for his underwear.
- Who is this?
- I'm a pair of his socks.
You're calling the station psychiatrist instead of working?
Well, it's free.
Do you know what psychiatry costs?
Anyway, this guy is helping me.
Helping you?
Last year this guy was doing our traffic reports from a helicopter.
If this doesn't work, he's going to be the movie critic.
What's going on?
You were doing so much better.
I'm thinking of going back with Arlene.
Are you serious?
I'm not sure she'd take me back, but maybe...
Think about what you're saying.
Going back to Arlene is like breaking back into Alcatraz.
You were miserable with Arlene.
Yeah, but I wasn't lonely.
Come home with me tonight.
It's my birthday, we're going out.
- I forgot your birthday!
- Don't worry about it.
Just come with me.
But you can't sleep over... because Barbara and I...
- You can't.
- That's okay.
Then this weekend we're going to Vegas.
That'll be fun.
Oh, boy, we got a big meeting, so come on.
Thank God I've got this job to go to every day or I'd really go crazy.
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.
What's with the champagne?
What are we celebrating?
We're celebrating two things.
First, today happens to be my 40th birthday.
Secondly, and maybe more importantly, in a minute George Leyton will call... to inform us officially that we are the new New York affiliate... for the Jerry Jackson Show!
- That show's a gold mine!
- Sure is.
Naturally, I had to clear the 6:00 to 10:00 slots.
We're talking scheduling changes, marketing, promotion and sales.
This is great for our station!
- Call for Mitch, line 1.
- Put it through.
This must be the call.
Put it on the speaker,
I want to share this with everybody.
'Morning. You have good news for me?
Tonight, I will pull down your pants... sink my hands into your cute little ass... and give you a tongue bath.
I'm going to start at your feet and slowly work my way up...
Hello?
New Rochelle.
Phil, we're here.
We're here.
- Look, come here!
- I'm up.
What?
Nothing.
Excuse me. Coming through.
Curly!
I'm sorry...
Who was that?
I thought it was somebody else.
Come on, it's your birthday. Let's go.
- What if he was a narcoleptic?
- Who?
Curly.
Curly? The trail boss?
They go into these trances where it looks like they're dead, but...
- they're not.
- He was dead. We checked.
He was...
Why are you even thinking about this?
I thought I just saw Curly on the train.
That's who I was chasing after.
Yeah, right.
We buried him alive.
He was underground for a year... got up, dusted himself off... and got on the commuter train to New Rochelle.
That makes sense.
You're right.
I must just be tired, that's all.
Honey, I'm home.
Guess who's coming to dinner?
So you knew he was coming?
- Yeah, I invited him.
- How could you do that?
- What are you saying?
- I'll leave.
You know I can't stand him.
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, this is Phil, our friend.
I'm not talking about Phil.
You thought I meant Phil?
No, Phil.
I love you.
Then what are we talking about?
- Then you don't know.
- No, I don't.
Can I buy a vowel?
- Your brother's here.
- Oh, no.
Glen? Crazy Glen?
What do you mean, he's here?
What do I mean? He's here!
He's in our den, watching a Spanish soap opera.
How is he? How did he seem?
He came in and asked me to make him a sandwich, no crust... then started making long distance calls.
Oh, God.
First, he did three scenes from Godfather II.
He still does that? I love that.
I'm warning you.
If you mention The Godfather to him...
I'll rip your arms out and beat you to death with them.
This started as a good birthday.
- What's he been up to?
- Nothing. He's the vice president of Lazy.
He goes from one family member to another... stays there until they throw him out.
He borrows money.
Borrows indicates an intent to repay.
He gets jobs that aren't jobs.
We only hear from him through change of address cards. He's lost.
He's a lost soul, he's a dented can...
He's behind me, isn't he?
Buenos dias.
Hello, Glen.
- How was your sandwich?
- Delightful.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Water off a duck's back. Come here.
Look at you, you're still the world's smallest big brother.
- Hey, Glen.
- Phil.
Long time no see. How are you?
I'm getting divorced, I'm living alone... struggling for a reason to live.
Too much information for me.
I cannot get over this place.
I mean, look at it.
You got birds and trees, and you got those fish and you got a cow...
By the way...
- there is something wrong with your cow.
- What?
I thought I'd help out with the chores, you know, so I figured... milk the cow.
I reach under there and I'm pulling and tugging.
Nothing, not a drop.
The cow's name is Norman.
You were pulling on his dick.
I'm gonna go wash up.
Let me ask you a question:
Who had Frankie Pentangeli killed?
The Rosato Brothers.
Who gave the order?
I love this.
There was this kid...
I grew up with.
He was younger than me, looked up to me.
We did our first work together.
Worked our way up the streets. Things were good. We made the most of it.
I got to change.
During prohibition, we ran molasses into Canada.
Made a fortune.
Ran molasses to Canada.
You should run brains to your head.
I can't believe you two are from the same gene pool.
- He's from the shallow end.
- When's he leaving?
I'll talk to him tonight.
Hi, Dad. Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Holly. Did you see your uncle?
- He borrowed $10 from me.
- Have you seen your brother?
- He's hiding from Uncle Glen.
Find him and tell him we're leaving in a few minutes.
Who's that?
It's Curtis. I invited him to come with us.
- Curtis? The lab experiment?
- Dad!
I know you like him, but it's my birthday and I wanted this to be a family thing.
- Mom!
- Answer the door.
I don't trust this Curtis.
He's got eight million earrings, his nose is pierced...
He's no boy, he's a fishing lure.
This is the business we've chosen...
What do we do about him?
We were supposed to be alone tonight.
I was planning to make noise.
I'll send him home with Phil. It's perfect!
Tonight is our night.
Tonight, I'm the Energizer Bunny.
Someone put a bullet through his eye.
Are you relaxed now?
It's time.
- I'm going to change.
- Change?
Into what?
Your husband's out of town?
- What?
- Nothing.
It's just something that helps me.
I'm Antonio, dance with me.
Oh, baby.
I look like a schmuck.
What's this?
What did you have in your hat, Curly?
What the hell is this?
'"$1,000,000 in gold.
'"I took it, you find it.'"
- What the...
- Mitch!
- I'm ready.
- Just a second.
Happy birthday.
Wow.
If I scream too loud... tough.
I'm done.
What happened?
- I just...
- There was, I think, too much anticipation.
You know, and you look so great.
And the kissing was great, really wonderful, topnotch kissing, and... it's better this way.
For whom?
You. I mean, for us, I mean... because now... that one's out of the way, and in 10 minutes the new shift comes on... and I'll be in total control.
So, go hide in any room in the house and I'll go look for you.
- What?
- Go. It'll be great.
Any room in the house.
I guess I got you too excited.
Go hide.
I'm hiding.
I don't believe this!
- Mitch?
- Okay.
I feel your pain.
Tell me again. Last year you buried someone you were fond of?
Someone I was very fond of.
With whom I had a very good relationship.
But now this dead individual seems to be following me.
- Excuse me?
- I am plotzing, I am seeing him...
You listening to this nut?
He's crazy.
- Are you seeing him now?
- Gotta go.
- 'Morning.
- Are you busy?
Actually, could I talk to you for a second?
What?
You know what, forget about it.
I love to hear about other people's problems.
Makes me feel normal.
I know that this will sound crazy, but...
I saw him again.
- Who?
- Curly.
Oh, God, Mitch.
Last night in the rain, outside my window.
I ran out, but he was gone.
I'm telling you, we buried him alive.
He is pissed, and he wants his hat back.
- I'm taking you home.
- No, let me explain.
Nobody returns from the dead for their hat.
- Lf this was in it?
- This was in Curly's hat?
It was sewn in the hat band.
Read this.
'"West Pac, eat my dust.
I took it, you find it.
'"$1,000,000. L. Washburn.'"
Who's L. Washburn?
- No idea.
- What is this?
I think it's a treasure map.
- No kidding?
- I'm not imagining this, right?
There's a piece missing.
But it shows the trail and the X where it's buried.
$1,000,000! I got those Time-Life books on the Old West... and I read there's money buried all over that's never been found.
I bet this map tells you where it's buried.
Tells you where what's buried?
Phil's grandmother.
What's up? We're really busy.
I'm going to do a little more research on this...
Grandma.
Wow, this is a big office.
It's not that big.
'"Mitch Robbins, Station Manager.'"
- What is it? I'm a little bit busy.
- Nothing.
That's great you got Phil a job.
That's really nice.
- What's it been, about five months now?
- Yeah.
I called you about six months ago, and asked if there were any openings... and you said there wasn't anything.
Then a month goes by... something opens up, and Phil gets it.
My tough luck, I guess. Or bad timing.
I always try to take care of you.
Take care of me?
Mikey, you're my kid brother, and you take care of me?
You're my kid brother.
My name is not Mikey.
Send Fredo to do this, send Fredo to do that.
- I'm smart.
- Stop.
I'm smart, I want respect!
Would you stop with this Godfather stuff!
You want to talk about this? Seriously?
'Cause you have a job for a friend and not for a brother.
And don't tell me he's special, all right?
I like Phil, but let's face it... he's a lamb chop short of a mixed grill.
So when you say...
I'll tell you something, and I'll be honest.
I didn't want you to work here because I can't count on you.
I have tried to help you in the past and you embarrassed me, frankly.
- When?
- When? The ad agency thing?
Bob Richardson gave you that job as a personal favor to me.
And you let him down.
Bob Richardson said terrible things about you behind your back.
I had a fight with him.
I said I don't care who he is, he can't talk about my brother like that.
And I refused to work there anymore.
He told me you never showed up.
Oh, that Bob Richardson.
That guy. He...
I'll just deal with the fact that my brother thinks I'm an idiot.
Don't turn this into an opera.
I don't think you're an idiot.
No? Never once in your life did you ever say you were proud of me.
For what?
Thanks.
Damn it!
Glen, wait a second. Come here.
- Glen, come here.
- Let go of me, you big bully.
Come here! Listen to me. I'm sorry... but you set me up for that.
You've a right to feel how you feel.
Would you please listen to me?
Friday, I'm going to Las Vegas.
There's a big convention.
Why don't you come with me and Phil?
I'll introduce you, you'll meet people, make contacts.
Maybe something'll come of it... if you're really looking for a serious job.
- Okay?
- Hey, Mitch. Come on. I found some...
Grandma.
Can you loan me $10?
And then it just hit me.
West Pac: Western Pacific Railroad.
I'll bet you that $1,000,000 is from a train robbery.
A little louder, some of the crack dealers didn't hear you. Thank you.
Get you a little decaf.
I got it!
Look at this.
'"June 12, 1908.'"
That's what it says on the map!
What could Curly have to do with this?
In 1908 he wasn't born yet.
Look at this.
The starting spot on the map, Spencer... it's only 65 miles from Las Vegas.
This is fate!
Up yours.
'"$1,000,000 in gold bars lost.'"
That was then.
Gold is 10 times more valuable now.
Twenty!
Sorry. What am I doing?
I'm getting crazy! This is ridiculous.
It's not crazy.
It's all fitting into place. Look.
I got the trial of the train robbers.
'"Leader of the gang, Lincoln Washburn... '"
- L. Washburn!
- I don't believe this.
'"...challenged the authorities.
'I took it, you find it', he said.
'"So far, none of the gold has been recovered.'"
None of the gold has been recovered.
- Let's do it.
- Do what?
- Go after the gold!
- Are you serious?
From Las Vegas, let's go to Spencer, follow the map and see where it leads us!
- You're getting a little excited.
- You're damn right.
This could be the opportunity of a lifetime.
Holy...
You are out of control.
Stop and think a minute.
Why would Curly keep something like this in his hat?
He couldn't take a filing cabinet on the cattle drive.
I mean, why put the map into his hat?
Why didn't he go get the treasure?
Maybe he never got around to it.
He never got around to it?
For $20,000,000 you'd budget your time.
Mitch!
When I saw this map, I got excited, too.
But we can't just go nuts. I mean, I'm 40!
What does that mean?
I don't know!
Come on!
If you showed me what any of this has to do with Curly... then I would believe you.
Then I would say, '"It's real.'"
But you can't. So it isn't.
Meet Lincoln Washburn.
Hi, honey, I'm in Las Vegas.
Yeah, at the convention.
We're just sitting out here relaxing by the pool.
Weather's hot, about 120... but dry, so you don't even notice it.
Honey, listen, here's the thing.
They had some sort of an electrical thing at the hotel.
I don't know. It was a thing.
The switchboard blew up.
What the hell am I doing?
No calls coming in, no calls going out.
So you have to call me on the cellular,
'cause I'll have it with me every second.
All right. So don't call the hotel... call me.
I've got to go, honey.
We're going to see Siegfried and Roy.
I love you, too. 'Bye.
You lied to her.
What was I going to do, tell her the truth?
That I'm jeopardizing my career to rent burros and go hunting for buried treasure?
I'm sure she'd be real supportive.
You know, this whole situation drips with irony.
- Does it?
- Oh, drips.
What if it was my idea instead of yours?
If I was bagging my job to hunt treasure?
You'd be saying,
'"Same old crazy, irresponsible Glen.'"
But you do it and it's all right.
How do you explain that?
Listen... we know it's a day and a half to the gold and a day and a half back.
We'll be back Monday, tops.
Wait. Why are you making me feel guilty about this?
Shouldn't you be grateful we included you?
If it's real, your share could be $7 million...
Everything's set.
Good. Where's my other friend?
He's inside, settling up with my partner.
That's a lot of stuff for a couple days camping. Shovels, ropes...
Well, actually... we're seismologists from Caltech.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Do you know anything about geology or earthquakes?
No.
Well, the continental plates are in a state of extreme... seismic tension... throughout this entire igneous, polygamous, Jurassic...
Hasidic region.
And when the plates get in that state of tension... what we have to do is dig down... and relax them.
Golly.
Well put.
So there's this guy's picture in an old newspaper... and he looks just like the guy with the map in his hat.
It must have been his father or his grandfather... but that's what convinced us the gold is really there.
Phil.
I don't really believe much in this treasure-hunting business... but I sure do wish you boys a whole lot of luck.
- We didn't want to look stupid.
- That's all right.
A lot of you city boys come up here thinking you'll dig up some gold.
Hell, it keeps us in business.
- Let's get started. Thank you very much.
- Oh, sure thing.
- All right!
- Now, you boys be careful.
Turn your boots upside down at night, watch your step, watch where you squat.
Squat?
A city boy came here about a year ago.
He was squatting to do his business... a rattlesnake got him right in the keister.
See you in a couple of days, I hope.
Did you tell him your entire life?
- Of course not, I just...
- Phil!
I'd think twice before going back to your wife.
It'd be like sticking your balls in a bear trap.
That would be a bad thing, right?
I'm joking, it's a joke.
We should go,
'cause, look, we're in a handicapped spot.
Gays in the military. Your thoughts?
We'll be back after these commercial breaks.
'Bye. Let's go, boys.
Good luck.
Hope you find lots and lots of gold.
Well?
It says, '"The band plays the way.'"
What band? What's '"plays the way'"?
I don't know. This is very hard to read.
Which way is north?
Up.
What do you mean, '"up'"?
North on the map is always up.
So, I guess that means... we should go up.
What are you saying?
Every time you go up you're going north, and every time you go down, south?
Now you're starting to frighten me.
Hold up here.
Maybe you should have bought a compass instead of four pounds of tortilla chips.
Let's see.
I can't make out anything here.
Look at this.
It's all written so small.
- I know. What is this?
- I don't know.
- Give me the map.
- Let Magellan have a look.
Yes, some of us come prepared.
Can you hold this, please? Thank you.
Move, you're in my light.
All right.
Now, the sun sets in the east, right?
No, the sun sets in the west.
That's if you're in the East.
But we are way out West now...
- so we are past where the sun sets.
- You can't be past where the sun sets.
And if you think you can, then I am directly south of an idiot.
- Which is down.
- Right.
Speaking of idiots, it doesn't say, '"The band plays the way.'"
It says, '"The hand points the way.'"
That's a lot better, what does that mean?
- The hand points the way.
- Yes.
The hand points the way.
Look, it's the hand!
The hand points the way. The map is real!
Look at it! Here it is!
It's real!
The hand points the way.
All right!
We're going to get the gold!
What are you doing?
I'm doing Walter Huston's dance from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.
Oh, yeah. He found the gold and he did the dance. I loved it.
Rich, boys. We'll be rich.
It's real!
The map is real!
The map is on fire!
- It's on fire!
- Shit!
Get it. Oh, no!
I got it!
Watch it!
Chiropractor.
Twelve.
Unbelievable.
Also 12.
- How do you do that?
- Fourteen.
No, I'm really asking you, how do you do that?
I don't know, I automatically see how many letters there are in every word.
My brother, the Rain Man.
Wayne Newton.
Eleven.
Yeah, definitely 11.
Let me ask you:
If I'd actually died today, would you still be playing this game?
Mitch, it's over.
You're okay. Everybody's okay.
I know, I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm just a little petrified of heights, which is why I'm not tall.
Listen, Phil.
I'm making you a copy of the map in case something like this happens again.
So Phil gets a copy, but not me.
We don't need three copies.
But why, automatically, does Phil get the copy?
Well, because...
I see.
- What does that mean?
- It means I see.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bed.
Listen, Phil.
Is it okay with you if Glen gets the copy?
- Fine.
- Thank you.
I've already given him $7 million, why not a map?
Okay, here we go. I told you,
I had already invited him to Las Vegas.
What could I say to him?
'"Stand by that roulette table, we'll be back in three days'"?
It was awkward.
I know he's your brother and I know he's a nice guy... but I've got this terrible feeling he'll do something to screw this up.
He already set fire to the map.
I know. I'll watch him.
I'll be responsible for him.
I don't want anything to mess this up.
It's too important.
Don't worry. So far, so good.
We're having a great time.
I almost got killed today.
I made you a map.
You did?
Yeah, I put it in your saddlebag.
Thanks.
It means a lot to me that you brought me along on this thing.
- Look, come on.
- No, I mean it, you know.
It reminds me of...
Remember when Mom would force you to take me to the movies with your friends?
She never forced me.
She'd just say if I didn't, she'd hang herself with the good towels.
But you were really nice about it.
I remember you gave me my own personal box of Milk Duds... and you'd take me to the bathroom... during the best part of the movie.
And you let me sit next to you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
What do you do?
What do I do?
Sometimes we don't hear from you for months.
I do a lot of things.
Sales, mostly.
For a while I was an animal detective.
What is that? A poodle calls and says,
'"My wife's fooling around with a bulldog'"?
No.
Once, by accident, I found a dog and called the owner.
He gave me $100.
So I made a business out of it.
I'd find lost dogs and call the owners.
People paid big ransom.
- Ransom! My God...
- '"Ransom'" is a bad choice of words.
That's the word they used in court, but I'm still fighting it.
Good for you.
There's Phil's horse.
Where's Phil?
- You all right?
- I'll just be a second.
Yeah, right.
He must be having trouble.
Relax, don't strain!
Oh, my God.
Too many tortilla chips.
I was bit by a rattler!
Mitch, help!
A snake!
A rattler!
He bit me on the ass.
God, I'm going to die!
Hold on.
Somebody, suck out the poison. Please!
- He's your friend.
- Yeah, but you slept with his sister.
I'm losing feeling.
Can't we wait till the poison travels up?
I understand. Glen, suck on his ass.
What?
I can't speak.
My tongue's numb.
I've done you a million favors, and one time I ask you to do something...
And the one time is sucking poison out of your friend's ass? Forget it!
I'm blind.
Where are you?
I'm here, Phil.
Don't worry, Phil, I'm going to do it.
But I am not going to forget this, Glen.
Mitch, please... don't tell my kids I died taking a shit.
Okay.
Hurry.
Would you suck, already?
That is not a snakebite.
You sat on a cactus.
You sat on a cactus.
I felt the sting, I saw that snake, and I remembered what those guys said...
I though I was really going to die.
- It's over, you're okay.
- You were going to do it.
You were going to suck on my ass.
It's over.
- You're my friend, Mitch.
- Sure I am.
You really care about me!
It's okay, Phil.
He gets a little emotional.
We used to be that close.
Oh, God.
Let's get that gold!
I want that gold!
'"This is the business we've chosen.'"
Batting third, and playing center field...
Number 7, Mickey Mantle.
I can't see.
How does the TV know what to record?
Because you've told the VCR, and once you tell the VCR...
- It tells it?
- Yeah, you don't tell the TV anything.
The VCR does all the work.
It's a great convention, honey. I love...
Hello?
Phil, is this beef jerky or turkey jerky?
Does it really matter?
How do they make it, anyway?
Jerky? It's an interesting process.
Take a really good piece of meat... then a New York City cab driver sits on it for four months.
How will those two laughing idiots we rented this stuff from feel... when we bring back all that gold?
The looks on those faces, those tobacco-chewing, gun-rack-having... chicken-screwing, sister-marrying, abandoned-toilet-seat-in-the-yard-having... vitamin-deficiencied, ugly faces.
They're behind me, aren't they?
Howdy, boys.
What a coincidence.
We were just talking about you.
- What are you doing here?
- We followed you.
Isn't that nice, huh? Talk about service.
Everything is great.
The equipment, the food...
That jerky, forget about it.
Better than Mom's, but she used onions...
We want the map!
Map?
The one old Stretch there told us about.
Oh, the map.
Like you said, we're like all those dumb city boys who come looking for treasure.
Nope.
This cowboy kept this map in his hat, and that means it was something special.
- And if his daddy did that holdup...
- We want that map!
- Don't make us look for it.
- Fellas, come on now.
I know what you're feeling,
I've been there.
I'm still there.
You feel like you have no control over your life... that nothing makes sense...
It's in the saddle bag.
Come on, you can't leave us like this.
We won't make any trouble.
We've got families, we've got kids.
Let us go and we'll forget the whole thing.
- Absolutely.
- Not me.
If I ever see either of you, I'll kill you!
Will you shut up?
Pig-boy!
That's my wife. I really should take this.
So if you'd just pull it out and press '"Send'"?
Looks like you won't be talking to her after all.
All right, look... you got two choices.
We can leave you here, and animals will smell your flesh burning in the sun... and will come down here and chew you up pretty bad.
Or?
We can shoot you in the head right now.
I think we shoot them right now.
Got any last words?
Curly, I knew it! You're alive!
I swear, we thought you were dead.
We didn't know.
Please, Curly.
I'm sorry we buried you, but you looked so dead.
Sorry, Curly.
I'm not Curly.
I'm Duke.
Duke?
Curly was my brother.
Your brother?
Brother?
The other night... it was you on the train to New Rochelle, wasn't it?
Yeah.
And I was outside your window that night.
You have a lovely home.
Thank you, we did a lot of work.
Where you were used to be a tool shed.
The other side was a total disaster.
The wood rot...
Where is my brother's map?
The map. They got the map.
You gave them...
- You gave them my brother's map?
- No, it's okay.
- They don't have the real map.
- What?
What do you mean?
It's the map you gave me.
I didn't make you a real copy, I changed it.
- Why?
- In case something like this happened.
You didn't trust me.
I drew you a copy that led to the highway!
I wanted you to be safe.
No! You thought I'd sneak off and steal the gold.
No, I didn't. L...
Would you two pixies knock it off?
Where's the damn map?
What the hell are you staring at?
Curly's twin, I can't get over it.
Well, get over it... or I'll turn you into twins.
Oh, I see.
That piece was missing when we found it.
And I accidentally burned that hole.
Can't tell you how often my daddy put me and my brother on his knees... and told us about this treasure.
He said we'd all go out together when the time was ripe...
- when they weren't watching him.
- Why did you wait so long?
If Curly had the map, why didn't you...
We didn't know there was a map till a year ago.
Our mom died.
She was 95.
Stabbed at a bar fight.
She gave Curly the map on her deathbed.
He wrote to me, told me to come home, that we'd be rich.
Till then, he was going to keep it under his hat.
Where were you?
You writing a book?
No.
By the time I got back...
Curly had died on a cattle drive.
Dumb son-of-a-bitch.
His pal, Cookie... told me that you had his hat, so I came looking for you.
Found you, didn't I?
Why didn't you just knock and tell me?
Why did you scare the life out of me?
Because I didn't know what kind of guy you were.
And I wasn't sure you knew about the map.
If you didn't...
I sure wasn't going to tell you.
Then you came out here,
I figured I'd let you do all the work... and then just take it from you.
You guys ought to head back to town.
Back, what do you mean, back?
Your mommies will be worried about you.
Thanks for the map.
Hey, wait a second, you can't...
I can't what?
Nothing.
That's it, I guess.
What the hell do you want?
You may look like Curly, but you're nothing like him.
Curly was a good man, a decent man.
He had dignity.
He wouldn't like to see you treating his friends like this.
- You were his friend?
- Yeah.
As a matter of fact, he changed my whole life.
I was really confused, and he told me that one thing...
He told you about that one thing?
Yeah. And if he was here and saw what you were doing... he would kick the living shit out of you.
So, Curly told you about the one thing.
He must have liked you.
He did.
You and your friends want to ride along...
As partners?
Hell, half of what's up there is more than I'll ever need.
Half?
You mean, you get a half and the three of us have to split a half?
Which is fine. I'll go along with that.
Just remember something.
Don't mess with us, pal.
We're from New York.
You ever talk to me like that again... and I'll turn your balls... into earrings. Understand?
Go for it.
We're close. Less than a day.
Can you hear it?
That's the gold, it's singing to us:
'"Come and get me.'"
Curly was wrong, there are two things.
Whatever the hell this is... and gold.
Let's go get it.
Phil, you won't meet women sitting at home reading those Time-Life books.
You gotta get out, go places.
If a woman wants someone like me, she goes to the pound... and gets herself a three-legged dog.
If this isn't too personal a question... when's the last time you were with a woman?
Saturday.
Saturday will be a year.
If I'd known
I would have gotten you a cake.
Who was she?
- This girl I met on the cattle drive.
- Bonnie.
Right, Bonnie. She was cute.
She was really sweet, too, but...
I was two weeks out of my marriage.
I was just a huge sack of tears.
Wonder if I still know how to do it?
Come on, it's like riding a bicycle, only you're naked.
Speaking of which, did you ever walk in on our parents doing it?
No.
- Why, did you?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Worst thing I've ever seen.
It's a horrible thing for a little kid to see.
This was three weeks ago, in Florida.
- Did you walk into the bedroom?
- It was in the kitchen.
Apparently it was spontaneous, because Pop still had his hat on... the one with fake grass and a golf ball.
It was horrible.
Wax fruit flying every place, dog barking... my kids' pictures flapping up and down on the refrigerator.
- Okay, stop it.
- Pop was working hard.
'"Enough of that, did you take the car in? '"
I think that's beautiful.
Not from my angle.
Two people in love after all those years, that's great.
Great? An hour later we ate on that table.
You okay?
- First time on a horse in 50 years.
- What? But you're a cowboy.
I was born around here, but left when I was 15.
Where did you go?
World War II.
Lied about my age and joined the Navy.
First look at the big blue. After the war...
Merchant Marine, charter boats, anything to stay on the ocean.
Been around the world 21 times.
Curly loved the land.
I loved the sea.
So you're like surf and turf.
- You thought that was funny?
- No.
I'm just thinking what I'd like to do to you.
Look at that.
Look at how great he looks.
Majestic, you know?
I had a dream about a horse like this.
I want to ride alongside him.
Why?
To see what it's like riding alongside a wild animal.
It's like going on vacation with Arlene.
Come on.
Where did he go?
Shit!
Where did he go?
Quiet.
- What is that?
- It's an earthquake.
Go! Go!
He's got friends, get out of here!
Stampede!
Holy shit!
Go! Go!
Let's head for the trees. Come on, go!
Let's go, come on.
Oh, no! Duke!
- I lost the goddamn...
- Forget the map, come on!
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- Let's get out of here!
I'm going after Glen.
Help!
Mitch!
Help!
I'm coming!
- Pull them up!
- Which ones?
Get to the front and pull them up!
I can't!
Mitch!
One... two...
Mitch!
What are you doing?
I'm saving you, you schmuck.
Glen, the wagon's coming apart!
- What?
- You'll have to jump.
We're coming to the edge, you've got to jump now!
- I can't!
- Jump!
- I can't!
- You pain in the ass... listen to me, for once.
Get your fat ass out here, and jump now!
Come on, jump... now!
- Mitch, do something!
- Hold on!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You can let go now.
Soon.
You saved my life!
You are amazing!
And the way you did it...
This is a whole lot different than just sucking on Phil's ass.
Excuse me?
Did I hear right?
- Yeah, Phil thought that a snake bit him...
- I don't care.
Now, whatever went on before... stops now.
Is this real bad?
It looks like... you spent the night with a Singapore hooker.
Great, that's it.
I'm dead.
- They're just scratches.
- No, you don't get it.
Barbara can't reach me.
By now, she's called the hotel in Vegas... and realized that I've been lying to her.
Then I return with scratches on my back?
That's it, it is over. I'm divorced.
By this time next week,
I'll be having a candlelit dinner with Phil.
Well, pick a night, 'cause the map is gone.
Everything's been trampled:
The food, tents, sleeping bags...
What's left?
Three miner's helmets and a tube of Chap Stick.
What's the difference?
The only thing that mattered was that map.
- This is all my fault.
- Your fault?
I dropped it.
You wouldn't have, if I hadn't frolicked with some stallion.
I'm sorry, Duke.
I'm really sorry.
If we don't get lost, will we make it back to town before we starve to death?
It's only a day and a half.
I can use every second... to think of another lie to tell Barbara.
If you guys go home...
I'm not splitting the treasure with you.
- What? You're not coming back with us?
- No. The gold is that way.
Yes, but the grand-slam pancake breakfast at the Mirage is that way.
Duke, we've got no map.
What will you do? Wander around hoping to stumble onto the gold?
Something like that.
Please don't take this the wrong way, but you're insane.
Insane is coming this far and then just going back.
If you guys want to go home, go ahead.
But, that gold...
That's the only dream I've got left.
'"Over the buffalo's back...
'"and under the frozen people.'"
What?
'"Over the buffalo's back and under the frozen people! '"
That's the rest of the map.
How do you know?
You never even saw the real map.
I saw it yesterday for a minute when we were looking for the hand.
This isn't memorizing a movie, or telling how many letters are in '"falafel'".
Seven. Now, I'm telling you... that gold will be in our hands by tomorrow night.
I can draw you the exact map.
I can get us there.
All you have to do is trust me.
Mitch, please... for once in your life... just trust me.
Trust you?
Are you sure it said, '"buffalo's back'"?
We haven't seen anything that looks like a buffalo's back. Nothing.
You know something?
You have not stopped whining since we started.
It's like going on vacation with an ambulance.
Shut up! You shouldn't even be on this!
Yeah? If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't even be here.
Freezing to death!
Hurry, it's going out!
That's the last one.
Good night.
Good night? How about good-bye?
We're going to die up here.
The sun's up in... five hours.
Tomorrow morning we're all going to be rich.
Hey, look, guys... we're really in trouble here.
In case we never find our way out... and I die first... eat me.
Eat you?
I mean, if you're starving to death.
Eat you? I don't even like talking to you on the phone.
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for the good of the group.
'"Eat me'"?
What a lovely image: '"Eat me.'"
Glen, I'm still hungry.
Is there any more Phil?
Pass the Phil.
He's even good cold!
Great party, thanks to Phil.
All right, so don't eat me.
Jesus Christ!
What a bunch of little pisspots.
Maybe if we huddled together, we could share our body warmth.
I read in my Time-Life book people can survive that way.
I mean, we're three 98.6s.
How much is that, Glen?
295.8. That's too hot.
So, what are you saying?
Well, I'm saying... we should hug.
All night?
Yeah.
Okay.
Come on, Glen.
Easy.
Hold still. I'm trying to sleep.
You know what?
It is a little warmer.
Hey, guys?
What about Duke?
What about him?
Shouldn't we invite...
- invite him to...
- To what? To join us?
- What are you, crazy?
- Look at him.
He could die.
This isn't right.
Who's going to ask him?
- You've been getting along with him best.
- Don't make me do this.
Go.
Save my place.
Duke?
- Yeah.
- The guys and I were wondering... if you'd like to come back to our place and... you know, maybe we could all...
All what?
Hug.
Holy God.
- I'm up here with a goddamn musical.
- No.
What I meant was... body warmth.
And if we press against each other...
Come on, you could die up here.
Maybe.
Curly... ever mention me?
Well, Curly wasn't really what you'd call gabby.
He wasn't that chatterbox that you remember from your youth.
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Oh, God, long ago.
But when you have a twin... you see him every time you look in the mirror.
Sometimes you don't know what you have, until...
Till you don't have it anymore.
I liked having a brother.
Did Curly... die happy?
Does anybody?
Well, I think he did.
One of the last things he said to me was,
'"There's nothing like bringing in a herd.'"
It must be how you feel when you're at sea.
I lost my boat in a squall about two years ago.
Half-squall.
I just wasn't a good enough sailor, so I came ashore.
What have you been doing since?
A friend of mine's son... opened a seafood restaurant in San Diego,
The Happy Pirate.
- I work there.
- You're the manager?
I am the happy pirate.
Bird on my shoulder, pirate hat... one hand's a hook.
'"How would you like your burger cooked, matey? '"
Sometimes I can't stand it, I want to spit in their goddamn clam chowder.
I've been a sailor for 50 years.
I don't know how to do anything else.
I'd just be lost.
Mitch, I...
I've got to find that gold.
I need that gold.
Guys, come on. Are you all right?
You all right? Come on, wake up.
Guys, we made it! We're alive.
Come on, we did it.
Come on, get up.
All right, now listen.
This is it. This is finished.
We're going back.
Listen, no arguments, Glen.
We'll never survive another night like this.
- You got no argument here. Let's just go.
- Right.
We'd better tell Duke.
Where is he?
You guys pack up, I'll go find him.
Come on.
Duke?
Oh, no.
Not him, too.
What is with this family?
Everybody dies sitting up?
You wouldn't hug us, you big dope!
You thought I was dead, didn't you?
What do you want?
Listen, Duke...
I know what this treasure means to you, but we're going back.
You mean, back that way?
- Over the buffalo's back?
- What buffalo's back? There isn't any!
There's a buffalo's back down there.
Here, look through this.
Look down there.
We crossed it in the dark and didn't even know it.
Glen was right.
He was also right about the frozen people.
- How do you know?
- Look down there.
I don't believe it.
That's gold, buddy.
Are you still going to go back?
Give me this. Go get everyone.
Look at them! Guys!
We're going to be rich!
'"Come and get me. Come and get me.'"
This could be it.
There's an entrance to a cave. Come on.
Come on, let's go.
I can't believe it.
- Where's the stuff?
- Get it. Put it down.
Where do we go now?
I'll bet that's what was on the corner of the map that's missing.
What's the matter, Duke?
Do you see something?
Quiet.
My daddy was in this cave.
- How can you tell?
- I just can.
Sure, like we could always tell when our dad had been in the bathroom.
There are a lot of passageways.
- Let's split up and each take one.
- Alone?
I'll take this one.
Hey, Mitch... what if the cave is booby-trapped?
You go down the wrong passageway and you get your head chopped off?
Or a huge boulder comes rolling at you, and it crushes your head?
Would you shut up? Stop it!
Why did you have to say something like that?
Look at this. There's three tunnels.
What do we do now?
Okay, Glen, take the one in the middle.
I'll take this one... and you take that. Okay?
Will you guys shut up?
Don't do that now.
Come on!
Thank you.
- Find anything?
- No, you?
Yeah, I found you.
- Can you hear something?
- Yeah.
It sounds like a train.
A train?
Hey, look, there's some tracks.
- Is something coming?
- I don't know.
Here's how you tell.
What are you doing?
I'm listening for vibrations.
Yeah, something's coming.
And it's definitely coming from that direction.
That was Mitch.
Are you okay?
- I'm all right.
- Where are you?
- Follow the tracks.
- I got it.
Hello.
I found it.
I found it.
Guys!
I found the gold.
'"Man, what a gold rush. I found the gold.
'"It's mine, I tell you. It's all my gold.
'"We don't have to show him no stinking badges. I found the gold! '"
Down here!
- Where is it?
- He found it?
Guys, I found the gold!
Let me see it!
Can I just say one thing?
We're rich!
We did it!
What the hell is going on?
Duke, we found it! We found the gold.
You did?
- Over here, Duke.
- Holy shit!
You found the gold? Holy...
Stand back, boys.
It is time for the Walter Huston dance.
- Hey, Duke, no more happy pirate.
- That's right, no more.
You believe this guy?
Last night he wouldn't even hug me!
See how the money makes a difference?
Let's go get the burros and start loading this stuff up.
Stop right there.
Did you really think we'd let you take the gold out of here?
- Thanks for doing all the work.
- I don't believe this.
- How the hell did you follow us, Pig-boy?
- Never mind that.
It's our gold now, and I'm afraid we can't leave witnesses.
Get the gun! Quick!
Mitch!
Glen!
It's better this way, isn't it?
It's better it's me instead of you.
This way Barbara and the kids...
I'm sorry I wasn't a good brother.
No, I'm sorry.
Don't worry, we'll get some help.
Hold on, we'll get some help, you'll see.
Somebody get some help!
Get some help!
It's okay. You always helped me.
You took me to the movies.
It's funny... it doesn't even hurt.
Glen?
You killed him! You son of a bitch!
You killed my best friend's brother!
These aren't real bullets. These are blanks.
What?
These are blanks.
Here.
- It's paint!
- What the hell is going on?
- That's funny!
- Yeah, real funny.
Hey, who's down there?
What in the name of John Wayne's ass is going on in here?
Clay Stone? From the cattle drive?
I remember you two. What are you doing?
Great buckets of bullshit!
It's Curly, come back to life.
I'm not Curly, I'm his brother, Duke.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Clay Stone.
Hell, I've been looking for you for months.
- What did you do to my boys?
- Your boys?
- What happened? We heard shots.
- Is everybody all right?
Ira and Barry Shalowitz?
Mitch? Phil?
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, it's Curly!
He's come back from the dead.
He looks great.
It's Duke, Curly's brother.
Will somebody please... tell me what the hell is going on here?
- Didn't Curly tell you?
- No!
Hell, it was his idea.
We take folks on a real Western treasure hunt.
Follow right in the steps of the old Washburn gang.
Yeah, we get these maps, and we follow these clues...
It's been exciting.
It's been great.
Better than those cattle drives. Yes, sir-ee.
More fun. You don't have to watch where you step.
Yeah, but we actually found it.
Yes, and it belongs to us.
What, that?
Everybody finds that.
Hell, that's just lead painted with gold.
Just to make it a little bit more fun.
Take a look for yourself.
Then, to give it extra goose... the boys come in, pretend to rob them... and shoot them with paint pellets.
Scares the Evian out of them.
Then there's no real treasure?
Curly came up here a lot of times, but he never found anything.
But he wrote to me, said we were going to be rich.
I don't know about being rich, but you make a damn good living.
He wanted to cut you in for a piece.
As far as I'm concerned, you can have his share.
That's what he meant?
I believe so.
You boys came up here thinking that this was real?
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Un-by-God-believable!
- Ready?
- I'm wound.
I got it.
We're Barry and Ira Shalowitz.
We helped bury your brother.
Maybe someday I can do the same for you.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
You start a conversation with,
'"We buried your brother'"?
- I was flustered.
- It's impolite.
Come on, let's get a cold beverage and...
- Going somewhere?
- No.
I'll take Clay's sons down and show them where we left our horses.
We'll help you.
I can do it.
You guys got to go to Las Vegas.
I don't got to go nowhere.
What are you going to do, Duke?
Work for Clay Stone?
Come up here every week and find a fake treasure? No, thanks.
So what will you do?
That gold...
That gold is up here somewhere.
- Duke...
- No, it's up here somewhere.
Thanks for... being Curly's last friend.
It was my pleasure.
Okay, come on.
Come on, baby.
Did Curly ever tell you what that one thing was?
He said that's what you have to figure out for yourself.
God.
He was a real pain in the ass, wasn't he?
- About five minutes.
- Good.
Well, how stupid do we feel?
I don't feel that stupid.
- Then you're stupid.
- No, I'm confused.
- Why don't I feel worse?
- I don't know.
Think about it for a second.
How bad do you really feel?
I don't know.
You know, not as bad as I should.
I feel pretty good, actually.
Why is that?
Well, we had a great adventure... we weren't killed, which is always a feature I like.
- And we found a box full of lead.
- That's not how I look at it.
I mean, you guys saved my life.
I mean, you stepped in front of a bullet.
You jumped on a guy who was ready to shoot me.
- They were blanks.
- But you didn't know that.
We didn't have any guided tour or box lunches.
All we had was each other.
And we made it.
Me... my best friend... and my brother.
We found the Washburn treasure!
We did it.
We found that gold!
Philly-boy... you did great.
Thanks.
I'm really proud of you.
God, look at this town!
Filled with desperate people.
Why do you think they come here?
Well, the buffets are lovely.
There's $3.95 all-you-can-eat.
They want to hit the jackpot, get rich.
Listen, I feel bad for you, I really do.
But could we talk about this later?
Maybe have a drink together?
My wife is coming in from the airport right now.
I told her everything... and I planned this fabulous evening of being yelled at.
I understand.
I came back... to tell you that I know what this is.
It's honesty... integrity.
Great, that's great.
So, listen, thanks for scaring me... and maybe...
Honesty.
Gotcha.
You know, Mitch... right down to the end...
I was planning to cheat you and your friends.
I was going to find the gold... then I was going to say I didn't find it... and after you guys had gone,
I was going...
I was going to have it all, all to myself.
Only...
I couldn't do it.
Of course not, because it isn't up there.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Curly was up there a million times.
My mother... didn't want either of us to find that treasure without the other.
She wanted her boys to do something together.
So she gave Curly the map...
Wait a minute.
She sent me the missing corner.
There.
Look at that.
'"Hot on my trail.
'"Re-buried here, 1909.
'"L. Washburn.'"
Did you draw this yourself?
Is that what you did?
You prankster. You scamp.
You little ruffian.
Forget it. I'm not going back up there.
There's nothing there.
I'm through hunting for treasure.
What am I, one of the Little Rascals?
What do you think of that, Spanky?
This is...
It's got friends.
'"Come and get me. Come and get me.'"
