Okay.
One picture and we're history.
That's what I'm afraid of.
ANDREAS: Come on.
NICKY:
Oh, man, do we have to do this?
ANDREAS: You want everyone in school to think we're chicken?
I could live with that.
You wuss. Come on.
I don't see anything. Do you?
ANDREAS: No, I don't see anything.
NICKY: Let's just take the picture and get out of here.
Fine. Here, take the picture.
Wait, I should be in the picture, too, or no one will believe I was here.
Shut up and take the picture!
You take the picture.
- You take it!
- You!
CASPER: Guys, don't fight.
I'll take the picture.
Say "cheese."
BOTH: (SCREAMING) A ghost!
"...and to the Save the Dolphins
Foundation, $11 million.
"To the Save the Pumas
Foundation, $1.2 million.
"To the Patagonian
Wasp Salvation Fund,
"$1.4 million.
"To the Dyslexic
Dalmatians Foundation..."
To hell with the livestock. What did the old stiff leave me?
I believe that what the bereaved is trying to express is that the sudden death of her only father has left a great gaping void in her bank... in her life.
And Carrigan wonders what he has left her to fill it up with.
Let's see.
"Bobcats, owls,
"snakes,
"daughter Carrigan,
"Whipstaff Manor in Maine."
And?
And I'm late for lunch, so if you'll excuse me...
Are you telling me that I just spent the last two days holding his clammy hand waiting for him to kick it, and all I get is one lousy piece of property?
No, it was lousy 50 years ago.
Now it's condemned. Enjoy.
Wait a minute. This is not fair!
I'll contest, and then I'll drag you and all of those damned dolphins into court.
Knock yourself out.
Dibs, this is all your fault.
As usual. If you would have just forged the damn will.
This is condemned seafront property.
Dibs, don't you get it?
Flipper got more money than me.
Carrigan! The deed's in there!
My God.
"Buccaneers and buried gold,
"Whipstaff doth a treasure hold."
Treasure?
Dibs, you idiot! Get it out.
I knew that place was worth something.
There's treasure in that house and finally, I'm going to get what I deserve.
Carrigan, I think I need a doctor.
There's plenty in Maine.
So, what do you think?
I think you're going to get wet.
Wait! Carrigan!
CARRIGAN: Dibs, light!
What a dump.
This place is fabulous.
You could just do so much with it.
- I know it's a bit spooky.
- Dibs.
CASPER: Hello.
Who is it?
CASPER: Afraid I can't answer that.
CARRIGAN: Why not?
CASPER:
It's kind of hard to explain.
Is he the caretaker?
Are you the caretaker?
CASPER: No.
Is he a drug dealer?
Is he... Are you a transient?
CASPER: No, not exactly.
Then tell him to show himself.
Show yourself!
CASPER: Here's the thing. If I do, don't scream, okay? I get that a lot.
Are you a burglar?
I must warn you that I am armed.
Hello?
Cut the crap. If you don't show yourself,
I'll have you arrested for trespassing.
CASPER: Okay, calm down, lady.
Here I come!
Hi! I'm Casper.
No, you shouldn't do that, or you'll wake the...
Too late.
So tell me. You have experience?
I have quite a bit of experience. Not, you know, like, exactly doing it, but I've studied it, and I've talked to people who have done it.
I've seen the videos, and I feel very confident that with my knowledge
I could do it, no problem.
Then you can handle this?
It's like no problem whatsoever.
Piece of cake. Piece of crumb cake.
(COMICAL INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC CONTINUES)
Well? How did it go?
It was fine. Was no problem. Piece of cake.
Who you gonna call?
Someone else.
What do we do now?
What do I usually do when something stands in my way?
Are you sure we're not going a tad overboard here?
Dibs, I have huffed and puffed. Now
I want to rip this place down.
I want my treasure. They can't haunt a pile of rubble, for Christ's sake.
People, please!
You're sweaty male construction types, for Christ's sake!
Dibs, do something!
WORKMAN 1:
Come on, get out of there!
WORKMAN 2: Charlie, quick, keep running and don't look back! Run, Charlie!
CASPER: Wait! They were just kidding! Honest!
Every time.
All I want is a friend.
Did you ever feel the way
Priscilla Cow felt
that you'd like to be completely different?
Almost everybody feels like that once in a while.
But most of the time
I hope you can be glad to be yourself.
That's really something to celebrate.
A ghost!
More on the Pentagon playboys as the story unfolds.
But, now...
step aside, Sigmund Freud.
Jump back, Joyce Brothers.
It's Dr. James Harvey, therapist to the dead?
Are you depressed? Are you anxious? Are you lonely?
Do you need someone to talk to?
No problem, if you're a ghost!
You can call them ghosts if you like, or as I prefer, the living impaired.
But the bottom line is, they need help sometimes
just like the rest of us.
ANCHOR: After the sudden unexpected death of his wife, Amelia,
Dr. Harvey gave up conventional psychiatry
and some say conventional sanity.
Now, along with his loner daughter, Kat, short for Kathy
Doc Harvey travels from town to town, searching for paranoid poltergeists,
scared specters, the depressed and the dead.
REPORTER: How do you feel about your father's livelihood?
Please don't ask me any questions.
REPORTER: Do you believe in ghosts? Ever seen one?
Does your father hurt you in any way?
He's my father.
REPORTER:
Could you just talk to us?
Look, it's the first day of school
and I'm sure I'll have homework, so could you please...
Carrigan.
CARRIGAN:
What part don't you understand?
No, not "I ate fish." I hate fish.
Don't you people have cows here?
Listen, I have had a long and tiring day.
Do you think that you could bring me a pint of HÃ¤agen-Dazs ice cream, rum raisin and a Diet Pepsi? Think you can handle that?
Now you want me to hold. Fine.
HARVEY: ...and with therapy they can begin to process this pain.
They can pack up their emotional baggage, and they can move on.
My Harry passed away five years ago, but he was so miserable.
His spirit would not leave the apartment.
So I called Dr. Harvey.
He came over
and in a few weeks Harry left
smiling.
HARVEY: The living-impaired are known for haunting us.
My question is, what's haunting them?
It's a lack of resolution.
Ghosts are simply spirits without resolution.
With unfinished business. And it's my job to find out what that is.
TERRY MURPHY: And so Dr. James
Harvey continues his work
dragging his daughter along for the ride. This week they're in Santa Fe,
but next week, "boo" knows?
Now, from the ghost shrink to shrinking...
Yes, I'm still here.
Get me Santa Fe.
(SINGING ALONG) That's life!
That's what all the people say
You're ridin' high in April
Shot down in
I'm sorry about your
Cactus Spooners.
Crooners.
I don't care what they said, you are not demented.
You're a picture of mental health.
They were talking about you.
Try explaining afterlife therapy to a bunch of junior high kids.
Some people go through life never questioning the norm.
But you and I, we're doing something extraordinary with our lives.
No, we aren't doing anything.
You're the one who's been packing up my stuff and moving me around the country.
I mean, in two years, I have been to nine different schools.
I've eaten in nine different cafeterias.
I mean, I can't even remember anyone's name.
For once, I would just like to be in one place long enough to make a friend.
Honey, you will.
Right.
I mean, come on, we're moving to Friendship, Maine.
Even I might make one.
You better, Dad, 'cause a single guy your age is more likely to become a bank hostage than to make new friends.
You sound like your mother.
You're not gonna find her.
Mom's not a ghost, Dad.
Yes, she is. She has unfinished business.
There's no such thing as ghosts.
I'll tell you what you go with me this one last time.
If I don't find what I'm looking for, then it's over.
No more moving, no more ghost mining.
You promise?
I promise.
Deal.
It's not so bad.
If you're Stephen King.
Dr. Harvey, hello.
I'm Carrigan Crittenden.
And this is Dibs.
Hello. I'm a close personal friend.
And this is my daughter, Kat.
His close personal daughter.
How nice to meet you, Kat.
Very nice to meet you.
You have a beautiful daughter.
Very beautiful.
We are very happy that you could come all the way to Whipstaff.
Very happy.
The both of us.
You're kind of hurting my face.
Sorry. Now, Dr. Harvey exactly what kind of time frame are you looking at?
Please tell me you'll just go in the house and spray and that's it.
No. As with a traditional psychological cure it can take weeks or even years...
Excuse me!
Did you just say the word "years"?
It's conceivable.
No, it isn't. Days is conceivable.
Weeks, maybe.
Possibly.
Months, no. Years, forget it.
- Forget it.
- Dibs, check.
Get the bouquet. Now, Dr. Harvey
I will be watching you very closely.
These are for you.
Have a lovely night.
Wow.
It's her. She's here. She's in my house. I did it!
What if she likes me?
What if she doesn't?
"Hi, I'm Casper. I'm a ghost."
No, that's total disaster.
"Yo, I'm Casper.
What's up? Give me four."
God, I'd kill for a pinkie.
See? That was easy.
KAT: Yeah.
Pennies should hold for now but we ought to get a box of 20 amps in the morning.
Right, yeah, 20s should be fine.
All right, I'm gonna go find a room, Dad.
You gonna be all right alone?
If I'm not back in 10 days, send a search party.
KAT: "Stretch"
"Fatso" and "Stinkie"?
Man, they had cruel parents.
I wonder where Doc and Dopey sleep.
Dad, I found my room!
There's a girl on my bed.
Yes!
Space master! In here.
HARVEY: It's very scary.
Have you seen any surprises yet?
Please. This is the deadest place yet.
This is a nice room.
Right. This place is a freak's holiday.
Mom belongs over here.
How about if I help you unpack?
Why bother? We'll just be repacking in two weeks anyway, right?
I'm kidding.
This place is fine.
Good.
Night, bucket.
Night, Dad.
We're gonna be glad we came.
You watch.
Hi.
Man!
Perfect first impression.
What a jerk!
Better?
HARVEY: Honey!
Honey, what?
Dad, I saw a ghost!
- It was a real, live ghost!
- Slow down. What are you saying?
I saw a ghost.
And it had a head, it was round, it was white and see-through, and...
Wait a minute. Now maybe...
Dad, please.
Do not think I'm as crazy as I thought you were. I promise.
No, but remember, ghosts can't hurt you, okay?
They're simply spirits with unfinished business, all right?
Let's just see about this ghost, all right?
Come here. Come on.
Over here. Check here.
See? No ghost there.
And then we can check over here, all right?
No, there's no ghost in there.
We can even check over here.
There. See?
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Dad, put me down!
This is insane. What are you doing?
I can walk, you know.
HARVEY: My God, this is big.
- Dad?
- What?
We're in a closet.
Right. Now I want you to stay in here no matter what you hear, okay?
Okay.
- Wait!
- What?
Dad, I'm sorry.
For what?
For not believing you. For thinking you were a total loser.
Apologize later.
Blew it!
Uh-oh.
It's them.
- STRETCH: Giddyup there!
- STINKIE: Go, horsie!
Man oh, man, them ponies run faster when we go down to Belmont.
Here, Flicka.
Hey, guys. Have fun?
Look, it's Casper!
Now on a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being fun and 1 being you yeah, we had fun.
Giddyup there.
Say, Bulbhead, why ain't you inside doing your chores?
Yeah, where's dinner? I'm starving.
Look at me, I'm wasting away here.
I know. How about you guys relax out here and tonight we'll eat alfresco?
Sounds great. Who's that?
Short-sheet, you wouldn't be trying to keep us out of the house, would you?
No!
I can see right through that bulbous little head of yours.
It's just such a lovely night.
I thought we'd have fun just eating under the harvest moon.
(SINGING)
Shine on, shine on harvest moon
Up in the sky
ALL: Bye-bye!
Hold it.
Fatso, you smell something?
Yeah.
No, besides him.
HARVEY: Hello?
No need to be afraid.
Yeah, right, don't be afraid.
I'd like to make contact with you, but just one little thing, please.
Don't pop out from under a rug or through a keyhole. No spooking.
Let's get beyond that.
I would like to approach you.
Now I'm coming in the room.
I'm in the room.
Can you deal with that?
Dive!
Dad?
I'm gonna kill you, your mama and all her bridge-playing friends.
You think you got it tough? I got a facelift.
There was one just like it underneath.
KAT: Dad?
Boys, we got a closet case here!
Smell-o-gram!
STRETCH: Sushi, anyone?
California roll coming up!
All for one and one for all!
Catch your pants before they fall!
FATSO: On the runway, we have Dr. James
Harvey wearing smashing underwear.
STINKIE: Marky Mark he's not!
You are good.
Stop. It's you.
Are we scary or what?
And it looks as if we're gonna go into sudden death overtime.
FATSO:
Anybody for a little shish ke-doc?
STRETCH: I am.
Who do you think you are defiling our domicile?
Dr. James Harvey, your therapist.
Dad!
Are you okay?
Dad.
STINKIE:
And he's down for the count.
A winner by a clean stink out!
Get back.
What the hell is that thing?
STRETCH: Not the nose!
I'm being hosed!
No!
This sucks.
Dad? Are you okay?
I'm fine. Why don't we go regroup?
- STRETCH: Get your hand out of my mouth!
- FATSO: I found half a Twinkie!
- Who let one?
- Who do you think?
Who's got their pointy head in my...
That's not my head.
STINKIE: You know, fellas, we're never this close anymore.
Morning. No, please don't scream.
I promise, I won't hurt you.
I'm a ghost. Yes, I admit it, but I'm a friendly ghost.
You have to trust me. If you scream, you'll wake up my uncles and they get awfully cranky. I'm gonna let you go now. Okay?
You're so cold.
Yeah, but it saves in the heating, though.
CASPER: Come on.
It's okay.
I can see right through you.
It kind of happens when you don't have any skin.
What are you made of?
You know that tingling feeling when your foot falls asleep?
I think I'm made of that.
Sunny-side up kind of makes me yak.
No problem.
So, can you go invisible?
That one's easy.
It's fresh.
Go ahead.
I've never done this before.
Me, neither.
- Can you hurt me?
- No.
Can I hurt you?
No.
Cool.
Morning, Dr. Harvey.
Some breakfast?
You okay?
Good.
How about a paper? The New York
Times? The Journal? Hong Kong Press?
- Sure.
- Coming at you.
Hope you're hungry.
I love the smell of fleshies in the morning.
ALL: I'm melting.
Auntie Phlegm.
What a world!
- They're gone.
- What happened?
They must have crossed over.
FATSO: Don't think so!
Guess again, Bonebag!
Fellas. Good morning.
Casper.
How dare you serve these air-sucking intruders before us.
I was just...
Give me my meal!
Okay.
FATSO: I feel like Oprah on hiatus.
STRETCH:
You look like Oprah on hiatus.
Ketchup, please.
STRETCH:
You know what the problem is?
Casper's got no respect for us.
After all we've done for the little glowworm.
What the hell do you think you're doing, Bulbhead?
This floor used to be dirty enough to eat off of.
But we have company.
Yeah? Company loves misery.
You guys are disgusting, obnoxious creeps.
ALL: Thank you.
I mean, what's your problem?
He's just cleaning the floor.
Shut up, Skinbag.
- Piss off.
- Take a hike.
- Get a grave.
- HARVEY: Honey!
...school thing and you don't want to be late...
- Drop dead!
- STRETCH: Too late!
You go have a lot of fun.
I know you will.
All right, guys, we've obviously gotten off on the wrong foot here.
Now, you know and I know that you really shouldn't be here.
So I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go ahead and finish your meal and we can meet in my office and start the process of crossing over.
What do you say?
It's your hour.
AMBER: Watch it!
Amber, wait up!
Had that locker last year.
Thanks.
My name's Vic.
Kat.
Coming, Vic?
MR. CURTIS:
Okay, gang, let's settle down!
Put a lid on it!
I got a couple of announcements to make.
First. The asbestos removal from the gym is taking a little longer than planned.
So we're gonna have to push back the Halloween Dance just by a couple of months.
As most of you know, my parents have finished the new boathouse.
So I'm sure it'd be no problem having the party at my place.
Great. That's done.
Secondly, we have a new student today.
I'd like you all to meet Harvey Kathleen.
Would you like to come up and say hi to everyone for me?
Why don't you tell us something special about yourself, Kathleen?
It's Kat.
I guess I just moved here with my dad from Santa Fe and Friendship seems like a pretty friendly place.
MR. CURTIS:
So where are you guys living?
AMBER: In outer space?
No. Whipstaff.
You've heard of it.
You actually live there?
KAT: Yeah, I mean...
I know it looks kind of funky and stuff from the outside and everything but, I mean... I don't know, inside it's kind of cool.
Yeah, if you drink blood.
Mr. Curtis, check this. We're dead for the Halloween Dance, right?
This girl has a seriously creepy house with room to spare.
Wait a minute. I thought we were having the party at my place.
Okay, we'll take a vote.
Whoever wants the party at my house, raise your hand.
Whipstaff?
FATSO: "Johns Hopkins
University." Very impressive.
- STRETCH: Very.
- STINKIE: Pull!
Not this one.
Thank you, gentlemen.
What a dish, Doc.
The little missus, perhaps?
Fatso, you animal!
Is she available, Doc?
She's my wife, Amelia.
She's deceased.
Even better.
But we're not here to talk about me.
See? Now don't you feel just awful?
I was just goofing.
Don't be goofing on Amelia.
She's as nice a person as they come.
She's always treated you right, Stinkie.
STINKIE: I got no complaints.
She's always been an angel to me.
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
STRETCH: I'm saying she's a peach. None better. Why?
You've actually seen her?
What, you think I'm blind?
Of course, I've seen her.
Who hasn't?
What, you're not looking for her, are you, Doc?
That's not really the focus of our sessions here, is it?
But as long as you raise the issue you wouldn't have a way of contacting others like yourselves would you?
I didn't think so.
Now that's not generally allowed there, Doc.
STRETCH: I mean, you got to go through channels.
Yeah, paperwork.
- Red tape.
- A holy mess, you know what I'm saying?
But for you, I don't know, maybe we could work something out.
You keep that ghoul
Crittenden off our backs and I'd say we got a deal. Right, boys?
Deal?
Deal.
Fatso, you know where
Amelia floats. Go.
It's that easy, huh?
We got a ghost-to-ghost network.
We share haunting stories.
We throw parties.
The parties are always pretty dead, though.
That was fast.
I think it's for you, Doc.
BOTH: Go.
Amelia?
My man!
What are you doing... I mean, hi.
Can I come in?
No. It's so much nicer out here in the flesh... Fresh air.
So did you ask your dad about the party?
Yeah.
He kind of hit the ceiling, but
I think it's gonna be okay.
Cool. So listen if you're not hooked up with anybody else, you wanna... I don't know you wanna hang out with me at the party?
I'd love to.
All right. Cool.
All right, see you.
Okay.
- Well, did you ask her?
- Yeah.
And she actually believed you.
This really bites.
No, it's absolutely perfect.
See? I'm a good dancer.
I don't need a costume.
I'm always the life of the party.
Casper! Listen,
I know you want to go.
Come on, we'd have a great time together.
Casper, I have a date.
What's this Vic guy got that I don't?
A pulse.
Big fleshy deal.
A tan.
Very bad for your skin.
How about a reflection?
Okay, but can he do this?
Come with me if you want to live.
Casper, no. Don't!
Casper, no. Oh, my God.
High, this is very high!
Casper!
KAT: Casper, this is beautiful.
CASPER: I come here every night.
Alone?
What were you like when you were alive?
I was...
I don't remember.
You don't remember anything from your life?
No.
So, nothing?
You don't remember what school you went to?
How old you were?
Your favorite song?
What about your dad?
Not even your mom?
Is that bad?
No. It's just kind of sad.
I wonder why you don't remember anything.
Guess 'cause when you're a ghost life doesn't matter that much anymore.
So you forget.
Sometimes I worry that
I'm starting to forget.
Forget what?
My mom.
Just certain things.
The sound of her making breakfast downstairs.
The way she put on her lipstick, so carefully.
I do remember.
She always used Ivory soap.
And when she'd hug me,
I'd breathe her in so deep and I remember, before
I'd go to sleep she'd whisper in my ear,
"Stardust in the eyes, rosy cheeks,
"and a happy girl in the morning."
If my mom's a ghost, did she forget about me?
No. She'd never forget you.
If I were alive would you go to the
Halloween Dance with me?
Can I keep you?
Casper, close the window. It's cold.
Hey, Dad.
I found your Visa card.
Where was it?
In your wallet. I was thinking, maybe I could use it to buy this perfect costume
I saw in a store downtown.
You always made your costume.
No, Mom did.
I think I could come up with something pretty good.
Why don't we just roll you in aluminum foil and you could go as a leftover?
Don't worry. You always look cute.
I don't wanna look cute. Cute's like when you're nine years old and you've got papier-mÃ¢chÃ© around your head.
I wanna look nice.
Like date nice.
Really?
Honey, you know, I think maybe it's time that we sat down...
It's a little late for that, Dad.
How late?
Don't worry, not that late.
Good.
You know that I would love to buy you everything that you wanted but until Miss Crittenden pays me, that thing is pretty worthless.
That's okay. Don't worry about it.
I'm sure I can come up with something perfect for the party.
GHOSTLY TRIO: (SINGING) It's my party, and I'll die if I want to
Die if I want to
Dad, please.
Whatever you do, don't let those guys crash it.
I think they're actually getting to be quite focused now.
GHOSTLY TRIO: (SINGING) You will die, too, when it happens to you
FATSO: Big finish.
STRETCH: Scream or sugar?
STRETCH:
The patient has finally arrived.
Late again, I see.
Could this be an expression of hostility, Doc?
FATSO: It's your hour, Freud.
What, so silent? No pearls of wisdom today, Doc?
Come on, Doc. Stay tough, don't stop.
Come on, Doc, hang with us homeboys. Wait a second.
What? You ain't thinking about packing it in now, are you, Doc?
We're just starting to have fun.
It ain't often we meet a bonebag as amusing as you.
Boys, this is serious.
I think the doc is having one of them fleshy breakdowns.
STRETCH: Time for drastic measures.
FATSO:
You think we should sing a song?
No. I think it's time we gave the doc our own prescription.
But what about the party?
The party'll have to wait.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Gentlemen.
- Happy hour.
- Happy hour.
ALL: (SINGING) Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of beer
FATSO: Here's to dead guys!
This is an outrage.
This is appalling.
You pay a man to get ghosts out of the house and what does he do?
He gets the ghosts out of the house.
Exactly.
It's about time.
Look familiar?
I know this!
I had five fingers. I remember.
Hootie!
And wait!
Check it out.
Hands up, Kat!
It was my mom's.
Can I?
Go ahead.
It's perfect. Do you think I could wear it to the party tonight?
Casper?
I begged and begged my dad to get me this sled.
He acted like I couldn't even have it
'cause I didn't know how to ride it.
Then one morning I came down for breakfast and there it was, just for me.
For no reason at all.
I took it out and went sledding all day.
My dad said that's enough but I couldn't stop. I was having so much fun.
Then it got late, it got dark.
It got cold and I got sick.
My dad got sad.
What's it like to die?
Like being born.
Only backwards.
I remember, I didn't go where I was supposed to go.
I just stayed behind so my dad wouldn't be lonely.
Is that your dad?
"McFadden claimed that he was haunted by the ghost of his dead son
"and that he invented a machine to bring him back to life...
BOTH: "The Lazarus."
Sorry. I guess we'll have to take the long way.
Hurry up! Come on!
My dad hid it so no one could find it.
But I remember where it is!
Wait till you see it.
Don't you know a shortcut?
You got it.
Casper, no.
Wall! Human! Stop!
Hey, over here.
Go ahead. Sit down.
I would hold on.
Why?
Casper!
Well?
What was that?
The "Up and At 'Em Machine."
My dad was a great inventor but he had trouble getting going in the morning.
Didn't he ever hear of caffeine?
What is all this?
My dad's lab.
Kind of a slob, wasn't he?
Here, he could do whatever he wanted to. No matter how busy he was he would drop everything to play pirates with me.
Man, we had so much fun!
Aye, matey. Buccaneers and buried gold.
Whipstaff doth a treasure hold.
Come on.
So where's this Lazarus thing?
CASPER: You're looking at it.
Down there?
That's useful.
I know there's a way to get it going.
I just can't...
What about that?
That?
That's the vault.
Wait! It's got to be this!
Hey, I did it!
Lazarus.
- What is this?
- Careful!
That's what makes the whole thing work.
Kind of an instant primordial soup mix.
It's what brings ghosts back to life.
Just enough for one.
Pull the lever.
Which one?
I don't know. Try one.
Casper.
I'm gonna be alive.
How am I gonna do this?
I couldn't even get my
Easy Bake oven to work.
Casper?
Am I alive?
Do you have any idea what this means?
Yes!
No.
You don't have to be scared of death anymore.
One minute you're a ghost next you're back on your feet free to come and go as you please.
- Hell, you could even fly through...
- Walls!
Thick walls.
Thick as steel.
Certainly could get to whatever's behind those walls.
Like a treasure, for example?
Then snap, crackle, pop, you're back alive and on your way to the Riviera.
If you were a ghost.
If you were.
Damn it, Dibs.
This won't hurt a bit.
CARRIGAN: Stop being such a weenie!
It's just business. Come on!
If you would just...
DIBS: So there you are.
Dibs, you're taking this way too personally.
Wait!
DIBS: Carrigan?
Are you a ghost yet?
Carrigan!
What a tragic waste.
She had my favorite sunglasses.
CARRIGAN: Not so fast, little man.
The bitch is back.
(SINGING) Warden threw a party at the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was playin' hard the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock
This Dr. Harvey's got a lot of spirit, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, but he's got his whole miserable life ahead of him.
So we could do him a favor and put him out of his misery.
Yeah. Good idea.
We've been the ghostly trio long enough.
Time to make it a quartet.
Can I just say something here?
Get a little personal?
Yeah. Why not?
Well, you know.
I just got to tell you you guys remind me of what it's like to hang out with the boys.
I mean you are absolutely there for each other.
I mean you look like right in the face.
You say, "I'm a ghost.
I don't need you."
You know what?
I'm gonna tell that
Miss Critten Picken...
Crichton Critten.
I'm gonna tell that lady you ain't going anywhere.
It's your house.
You're haunting it.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law...
- ALL: No.
- Yes.
ALL: No.
Yes.
I didn't think so at first but you guys are great.
I love you.
No.
What a sweetheart.
I can't croak him now.
Me, neither. No way.
All right, boys.
The night is young.
We are going to clean out every bar this town has got!
We're gonna booze it until we lose it.
Come on.
I think my ears just popped.
CARRIGAN: Come to mama!
My treasure!
You mean my treasure.
Miss Crittenden?
In the flesh.
Well, in a couple of minutes.
Dibs! What are you doing?
This is no time to shave!
Helping you. Remember?
Remember what?
This!
You stole that. That's Casper's.
So sue me!
Dibs! The capsule, now!
Coming. I'm coming, okay?
Keep away from me!
Here!
Jump in!
Perfect.
We're here.
Okay.
Hi. Come on in.
This is the room.
Stay together, you'll be safe, and I'll be right back.
Amber, do we have to do this?
She wants a Halloween party.
She's gonna get a Halloween party.
That's my treasure!
- Stay back! Keep away from me!
- Casper.
Don't come near me, you spiteful spook.
I'll knock you into the next world!
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, Poppin Fresh.
It's my turn in the oven!
Dibs! Get this thing cooking, you flaccid little worm, you!
How kind of you to drop in.
You know, if there's one thing I've learned from you it's always kick them when they're down.
And, baby, you're six feet under.
Oh, what a shame.
Sorry, sweetheart.
We're through.
I am not gonna forget this, you ungrateful lousy little worm, you!
You can haunt me all you want but it's gonna be in a great, big, expensive house with lovely purple wallpaper and great big green carpets.
And a little dog called Carrigan.
A bitch, just like you!
I got the power!
I got the treasure!
And you have a flight to catch.
Any other takers?
No. But aren't you forgetting something?
What?
Your unfinished business.
My what?
You know unfinished business.
All ghosts have unfinished business.
That's why they don't cross over.
Unfinished business? I have no unfinished business.
I have my treasure, my mansion.
I have everything!
I'm just perfect!
CARRIGAN: Wait, I lied!
I have unfinished business.
Lots of unfinished business.
I'm not ready to cross over yet!
Wait! You tricked me, you rotten little brats!
No!
My treasure!
A ball? That's your treasure?
Are you kidding?
It's autographed by Duke Snider of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
My favorite player.
Casper it's time.
HARVEY: Honey, I'm home!
Dad?
No. What have you done to him?
Nothing. He's just a little dead.
I'm free!
I've never felt so good in my life!
I can fly!
Rookie.
Stinkie, work with him.
Dad?
Who's the girl?
Dad, it's me. It's Kat!
Kat?
Kat Ballou?
Katatonic?
Katastrophic?
Kreplach soup?
Flash flood alert.
Don't you remember?
Yeah, I remember!
No, this.
Kat.
Sweetheart.
What have I done?
Kat, don't cry.
Please.
Come on, Dr. Harvey. You need this more than I do.
Casper.
This is the way it's got to be.
KAT: Dad?
Honey.
It felt like the strangest dream.
I thought we almost lost each other for a minute there.
Oh, bucket.
Your party started without you.
Your date's probably waiting.
Maybe we should get going.
Where are we?
Well, go ahead.
What about you?
This is your party.
Go do your thing.
Go hang or chill or kick it, or whatever you call it.
I think you got a date out there.
Thanks, Dad.
I hope no one saw that.
AMBER: Hold still.
VIC: I'm trying. Could you weigh any more?
Just shut up and get your head down.
You got to see this.
People are gonna freak.
Let me see.
Cool.
Thank you.
You're...
That's right.
Kat's mom?
Are you an angel?
That was a very noble thing you did tonight, Casper.
I know Kat will never forget it.
She needs her father.
And I know yours will never forget it either.
You've fulfilled his greatest dream, Casper and I know he is very proud of you.
And for what you've done
I'm giving you your dream in return.
But it's just for tonight.
Sort of a Cinderella deal.
So I have until midnight?
Ten.
Hey! Cinderella got until midnight.
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.
I told you I was a good dancer.
Can I keep you?
Casper?
Hello, James.
Amelia.
It's all right.
It's just me.
I thought I'd have a hundred things to say when I...
How?
Let's just say you know three crazy ghosts who kept their word.
James, I know you've been searching for me.
But there's something you have to understand.
You and Kat loved me so well when I was alive that I have no unfinished business.
Please don't let me be yours.
But, Amelia
I don't...
I don't really know what I'm doing.
What parent does?
James, Kat is growing up beautifully because of you.
No wonder I miss you so much.
Just a couple of things, though.
Don't pick up the extension every time she gets a phone call.
French fries are not a breakfast food.
And don't ask her to wear a T-shirt under...
Under her bathing suit.
I know.
- Our daughter is a teenager.
- A teenager.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Where I can watch over both of you until we're together again.
Good-bye, James.
Casper?
Boo?
Not bad for my first party, huh?
Couldn't have been better.
It ain't over yet.
Boys?
(SINGING) Casper the friendly ghost
The friendliest ghost you know
Though grown-ups might look at him in fright
The children all love him so
Casper the friendly ghost
He couldn't be bad or mean
You know, he jump and play
Sing and dance all day
The friendliest ghost you've ever seen
He always say "Hello"
And he's really glad to meet ya
Wherever he may go
You know, he's kind to every living creature
Grown-ups don't understand
Why children all love him the most
But kids all know that he loves them so
Casper the friendly ghost
Casper, your friendly
Your friendly
He always say "Hello"
He's always glad to meet ya
Wherever he may go
He's kind to every living creature
Grown-ups don't understand
Why children all love him the most
But kids all know he loves them so
Casper the friendly ghost

City by the mighty dirty river
City by the greasy rolling sea
I crawl so small
And it stands so tall
And it all belongs
To me
Welcome to Joe's apartment
It's our apartment, too
We've been around for a hundred million years
And we'll be here long after you
Let's go to our place
It's a great big space
It's where I wanna be
Where friends all meet
And life is sweet
'Cause everything's for free
It's the joint, it's a gas
It's a big fat boot in the ass
Let's toast! Raise your glass
Here's to Joe! A man with class
So! Hello from Joe's apartment
You're gonna love the view
It's a nest that beats the rest
We're so glad that you're our guest
Come on in, we're all undressed
Joe's apartment, we welcome you!
Nice singing!
The movie's starting.
Dear Mom,
I made it to New York safe and sound.
Hands up, pinhead!
Dear Mom, I made it to New York.
Hands up, pinhead!
Dear Mom--
Hands up, pinhead!
Please send money.
Don 't worry, Mom, I'll pay you back soon.
I'm bound to get a job.
I'm a college graduate.
But first things first.
I got to get an apartment.
I hope I can get one really cheap.
$1,500 a month?
There's a hole in the ceiling.
It's a private atrium.
$1,100 a month for 300 square feet.
That's a sweet deal.
No vacancy.
$1,500 a month.
Nothing for that price range.
Try Nebraska.
Oh, my God, mister. Are you all right?
Two days, seven hours, twenty-three minutes and four seconds.
That's how long I've been lying here.
Are you okay?
Of course not. I'm an artist.
I wanted to express how cold, how pitiless this city really is.
Nobody touched you for two days?
Spitting doesn't count.
You must be from out of town.
Yeah.
Iowa.
-What's your name?
-Joe.
Walter. Walter Shit.
Walter Shit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Looking for a place?
Something for $100 a month.
Hey, junior here thinks he's going to find his own rent-controlled apartment!
Rent-controlled apartment?
Yeah.
A place where the rent's been frozen since the 1950s.
Those places are hard to find because no one ever leaves them.
Not unless the landlord gives them a little help.
I love the real estate business.
They're tougher than they look.
See? There's really no way to get a rent-controlled apartment.
No way at all?
I mean, only if it's your mom's apartment... and she croaks.
How you doing, Mrs. Grotowski?
Oh, my God!
Joe, Mrs. Grotowski doesn't have any family.
You pose as her son, take her apartment.
What?
I couldn't!
Oh, my God!
Joe!
It's your mother!
And she's dead!
Thank you.
My first place!
Quiet!
Got to hide! Got to hide!
-Never seen him around before.
-Where's the old lady?
-Luggage! I don't like it!
-Stay undercover.
Right, another stupid human.
-Shut up!
-Can it, both of you.
Oh, no!
Yummy, yummy!
Damn. Ralph's out there. Poor sucker.
This is the greasiest, ugliest bug I've ever seen in my life.
-Look at that.
-Our kind of guy.
He likes good living. That's for sure.
-He's not so bad.
-He's got potential.
Did you hear that? "Greasy."
Nice compliment.
I thought you was smushed for sure.
Who's out there?
Schlomo and Pauli, who else?
-Schlomo, I quit drinking.
-Me, too, Pauli.
Ever since I joined this health club.
It's a great lap pool.
Diver down.
We're gonna get drunk.
Hold on. He's having a taste of Old Hound Dog instead.
I'll drink to that.
I can't tell you how happy I am to be finally out on my own, Mom.
No, no thanks, Mom.
I can find a job by myself.
Look how easy I got a place.
Yes, Mom.
No, Mom. Right, Mom. Good, Mom.
Isn't his mom supposed to be dead?
Landlord!
I hope everything's going fine up in heaven, Mom.
Pray to you later. Amen!
Joe, who are you talking to?
Who the hell are you?
Joe Grotowski.
Joe F. Grotowski.
Vladimir Bianco.
My cousin, Jesus.
Vlad and Jesus Bianco?
You are related?
Speaking of relations,
I knew your old lady... and she never talked you up! Not once!
-I've been away at college.
-ls that so?
Well, $50 rent, college boy.
-Cash!
-Now!
Sorry about your moms, man.
But maybe you won't be missing her long.
Amen.
Dear Mom, thanks for another loan.
I haven 't found a job yet... but I'm on the lookout for something good.
Thank you for calling 91 1.
Your call is important to us.
Please stay on the line.
Your local police precinct will be with you shortly.
Central Complaint Department, please hold.
I don't know. Please hold.
I can't help you. Please hold.
Like, who cares, man? Please hold.
Alligators in the subway.
Interesting, ma'am. Please hold.
No, sir. Don't try to saw it off yourself.
Please hold.
-Central Complaint Department.
-I'm calling from 324 1/2 East 8th Street.
No water, no heat, no power.
Roof leaking, drug dealing.
People falling out of windows?
Congratulations, sir.
This is the worst call I've had all day!
Really?
Coffee break!
Please hold.
Hello?
Lily, what's up?
Oh, Blank. Hey.
This garden of yours is really coming along.
-Quite a change from the old air shaft.
-Oh, yeah.
It's such a relief after all those calls.
It ain't bad now.
Wait till there's a riot or a fire!
Serious O.T.
I wish we could do something other than put people on hold.
What are you doing in this dead-end city department anyway?
Child, go work for your dad.
The man's a U.S. senator.
Wear a nice dress, sit next to his podium.
You could get into politics, easy.
-Mr. Bianco.
-Check it out.
Please, Senator, just call me Alberto.
Have you brought me good news, Alberto?
My second to the last tenant has just taken flight, Senator.
We two saw her off personally.
Wonderful. She'll love the condo you bought her.
Nothing is too good for my tenants.
And how about your last tenant?
We made his final arrangements.
And soon the building will be yours.
The U.S. government will have acquired the last property we need... for the brand new...
Manhattan... maximum security... federal penitentiary.
The biggest prison in the world.
Whatever happened to the Lower East Side?
How did it decay so badly... that the only thing that'll sprout in its soil... is a jail?
We can't take all the credit for that.
But we're glad we could help.
Oh, look at those kids.
They could get hurt, playing in this empty lot.
I used to get plenty of cuts and scratches... but that's all there is around here.
Hi, guys.
What are you making?
A crack house.
Oh, my God.
This is awful.
This should be a public garden, with safe places for kids to play... with flowers and trees.
Lily, this ain't no cute little building atrium.
This is the nastiest neighborhood in New York City.
Come on, girl.
-Conference.
-What's up, Ralph?
This new guy, Joe. He don't wash, clean, vacuum. He don't give a crap.
He's the dirtiest slob on the planet.
I think I'm in love.
-Me, too, Ralph.
-I vote we keep him.
We got to break him in, that's all.
Oh, my gosh!
Looks like the landlord wants to change Joe's lease.
They aren't doing no paint job.
Let's not kid ourselves.
If Joe gets greased, we're next.
I won't stand for it!
Let's teach them toe-heads some respect!
Roaches to the rescue!
I love the smell of this old couch.
-Double time! Double time!
-Hang on!
Hurry! These goons will bust Joe's skull!
He knows it, too.
-Feel him shaking?
-Spring is in the air.
-Stay cool, Joe.
-Take it easy, Joe.
Don't worry, Joe. We got your back.
Who....
Where is he?
-Troops! Antennas up!
-Sir, yes, sir!
Bombs away!
Give me a kiss, asshole.
God, they talk?
That's right!
I'm about to kick your ass, too!
Disgusting little....
Your mama's cooking sucks!
I wouldn't even touch it.
I think he got me! He got me!
I'm heading up to that big Dumpster in the sky.
You missed!
Over here, fruitcake.
Let's go!
It's a roach clip. Get it?
Now you're in trouble!
Ought to stomp your freaking head!
Slip on something more comfortable.
Hiya, Hansel and Gretel, lay off our buddy Joe.
-Okay. Just let us go, please!
-Are you listening?
Because if you ain't, you'll get a roach in every meal you'll ever have... for the rest of your freaking life!
-You got that?
-Yeah!
We know where you live!
We live where you live.
-What a fall!
-Leaving so soon?
-The party's just started!
-See you.
Hate to be you!
-A spare!
-You was robbed!
You was great, Ralphie.
What a couple of pansies.
Joe, are you all right?
Get back!
-Joe.
-Buddy!
-That ain't no way to treat your friends.
-My friends?
Sure! We like the way you run things here, so we wanted to keep you around.
You can talk.
Talk? We can sing!
Garbage
Garbage
Garbage
Sorry.
The garbage in the moonlight
Gives off a lovely smell
Sipping sewage with my baby
In our little roach motel
Please, don 't tell
On an ocean trip on a garbage ship
With a cockroach I adore
We 'll take a taste of the medical waste
That washes up on shore
Oh, sweetheart, say you love me
And crawl underneath my rug
You're one in a thousand billion, baby
Oh, won 't you be my bug?
Oh, won 't you be my bug?
Please, be my bug
God, what a nightmare.
I'm up. I'm up already.
-What's that?
-I'm trying to get some shuteye here.
Morning. My name's Ralph Roach.
This is my associate, Rodney Roach.
What's happening, Joe?
Another hot and muggy, Joe?
-What are you doing on my breakfast?
-Little nosh, that's all.
-How's it hanging today?
-Word up.
How do you like the Knicks?
How many of you are there?
This apartment? Not a lot.
About 20,000, 30,000, 40,000.
Mostly family, you know.
-And you can talk?
-Sure.
We just don't talk much.
Not to people, anyhow.
No point. People smush first, and ask questions later.
But not you, brother. You're different.
Oh, yeah?
Joe, Joe!
Let's be friends.
We just saved your life, remember?
Besides, Joe... if those two friends of yours come back, we might come in useful.
So, how about a live-and-let-live philosophy here?
"Slobs of a feather swarm together."
-Makes sense to me.
-That's fair.
-What's yours is ours.
-Stereo rights?
Just warn us before you flush.
I got to get out of here.
-Where are you going?
-None of your business.
-Mind if we hang out with you?
-Yes!
-Come on!
-Don't be that way, Joey!
Can't we? Please?
-You won't even notice us.
-We'll be good.
What's up his butt?
We ought to keep an eye on him, in case he needs our help.
-Right as usual, Ralph.
-Excellent idea, Ralph.
Ritardo's!
Come on in. The cheese is fine.
You're fired!
Here are your enlargements, sir.
You're fired!
You're fired!
-You're fired!
-You're fired!
Poor Joe. Having trouble keeping a job.
We're doing our best to help.
Guess we got to keep on trying.
-Love this guy! Breakfast?
-Don't mind if I do.
-Don't panic or nothing.
-What do you mean?
Well, it appears to me... that one of our most dreaded natural enemies somehow got in!
Oh, my God!
Joe, wake up! A cat!
Don't let it get me!
How's everybody doing tonight?
Thank you! Good-looking crowd.
Anybody here from New Jersey?
What exit?
He's dying out there.
Some pretty cool cats from there:
Sinatra, Bruce.
Say, nice set of whiskers, sir.
Poor Ralphie. I can't look!
It's Cousin Tiny from Texas!
Howdy, cousins! Just buzzing through!
Let's have ourselves a little rodeo!
It's chicken-pickin ', finger-lickin ' good
I got my honey in a sunny neighborhood
It's a wrassling, hassling, dazzling show
Grab a lady and do-si-do
A little bitty kitty-cat rodeo
Scrape it, Clyde!
Now you ought to bring your daughter
'cause it's hotter
When he's shaking and a-baking and breaking it in
He's a-gripping, he's a-slipping
Come on, mister, bring your sister
Bring her to the rodeo
Go, Joe!
-Go, Joe!
-Attaboy, Joe!
-Look at those claws digging into his face!
-That's got to hurt!
Good arm, Joe! Good arm!
You saved my life!
No human being has ever saved the life of a cockroach.
This is a breakthrough in "interspecio" diplomacy!
Yeah? Well, stop following me to work already!
-For God's sake!
-You got it, Joe.
-Forget about it.
-Don't worry.
We don't follow you to work no more.
Yeah, right. I've heard that before.
Give me a "J"! Give me an "O"! An "E"!
-What's that spell?
-Joe!
-What's that spell?
-Joe!
Dear Mom, the job situation has been a little tricky.
But I know I'm going to land something soon.
Congratulate me.
This is the first of my works to use paint!
I call this piece lnstant Minority.
I did the whole block.
But people are black or white or brown.
Nobody's purple!
Periwinkle!
You're now the world's smallest minority.
How am I supposed to get a job looking like this?
-You know how to play drums?
-No.
Perfect! You want a job?
I'm doing a musical performance.
You can sit in for my drummer. He's dead.
Well, sure.
What? He's dead?
Actually, it's a very funny story.
There's a crack dealer in our building and my drummer called him--
Slit his throat so badly that his own mom couldn't identify him at the morgue.
I'll miss that guy.
Is it a deal?
Excellent. Here. You can put these up.
That's a cool name for a band.
Shit.
-Hi.
-Hi.
It's a band.
What is?
This.
That's nice.
I'm the drummer.
We kick ass.
I guess you must.
What are those for?
It's a community garden.
We'll plant flowers and have a playground for kids, vegetables for families.
Cool.
Yeah, but the lot is totally bare of soil.
We'll need fertilizer.
-Fertilizer?
-Yeah, a lot of it.
And then I saw your sign. I thought... that is exactly what we need.
Well, maybe I can help out.
Wonderful. I'm Lily.
I'm Joe.
Dear Lily, it was great to meet you.
I'm into gardening, too.
I can plant trees, weed flowers, dig bulbs....
Boobs, Joe, not bulbs!
Tell her you dig her boobs!
Dames like compliments!
Nothing like the sight of a woman with a sack of grubs hanging off her abdomen.
Can't you see
I'm trying to have some privacy?
Hey, Joe, what's this idea you people keep kicking about "privacy"?
Explain it to us. We don't get it.
People need to be alone sometimes.
That's a false philosophic concept.
-You are never alone.
-Not in New York City.
Us roaches see everything you do.
So what? We're all friends here.
Okay. Fine. Shut up.
Oh, I like that.
-"Shut up," he says.
-Shut up yourself.
-No manners, this guy.
-Who needs you?
-So long, Romeo.
-I bet she's a dog.
Dear Lily, I want to help your garden.
That's "plow your garden," Joe.
Tell her you want to plow her.
I said shut up already!
Come on, Joe!
Dames secretly like it when you give them shit.
We need fertilizer. Lots ofit.
What are you doing?
Giving you a neck rub.
You seem a little tense.
-Okay, okay! We're gone!
-Chill out.
Wait.
Hey, get out!
You've got to be more careful with those enthusiastic greetings.
I'm an old man.
Oh, Daddy.
I got a call from your job supervisor the other day.
He told me that you're spending a lot of time in that little atrium of yours.
But I must insist....
Tell me where you got those earrings.
Saks.
The atrium is just a dry run for my first big project.
What? I'm sorry, a project? What project?
I'm starting a community garden in the East Village.
That's nice. Whereabouts?
East 8th Street in Avenue B.
In your old neighborhood.
Isn't this great, Daddy?
Pumpkin...
I'm building a federal prison on that site.
A prison?
In the middle of the East Village?
Why not? With all the crime and drugs, it's already a prison.
Not until my 30-day gardening permit expires.
And by that time,
I'll have the whole East Village behind me.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have some mulching to do.
Hey, what's that smell?
-It's odoriferous.
-It's "splendoriferous."
-Joe, you are a prince among men.
-Always thinking of your buddies.
Letter for Ralph.
-Mail call!
-Anything for me?
-Letter for Rodney.
-A postcard from Uncle Sid.
How is Tampa?
Garbage magazine?
-Thanks a bunch, Joe!
-My sex toy arrived yet?
Junk mail, junk mail.
Hey, one for me.
-It's from Mom.
-No kidding.
-How is the old bag?
-Be respectful.
Joe knows I'm kidding!
"Dear Joe, got you a job interview with P.I. Smith & Sons.
"The boss is my old high school classmate."
-P.I. Smith & Sons? Great company.
-You've heard of them?
They're the biggest manufacturer in New York.
What do they make?
When I was about your age,
I woke up one morning and said to myself:
"Urinal cake.
"That's the future."
So...
I decided to aim for men's room manufacturing.
Now I'm the richest man in the urinal sanitation industry.
Twenty million men piss on my name everyday.
That's great, sir.
So, you're an lowa boy, like me.
Yes, sir. Went to Murchison High School.
Good old Murchison.
"Go, Bullfrogs! "
My mom could do that cheer really well.
She was a varsity cheerleader.
I remember.
Your mom was the hottest tomato in school.
Does your mom still wear her hair in that sexy way?
Does mischief still sparkle in her eye... that minx?
Mommy still got that saucy swing to her hips?
Did Mommy ever give you... a sponge bath?
Welcome to the research department for P.I. Smith & Sons.
You will play an essential role in our quest for the perfect urinal cake:
Used product retrieval.
Your first assignment, retrieve all used product from the restrooms... at 58 East 161st Street, the Bronx.
Deliver them to the research department for testing.
58 East 161st Street.
58 East 161st....
Joe's here!
Let him watch. He's okay.
What's this?
Channel R.
The roach public access channel.
You roaches have your own channel?
Shut up!
Are you ready for something itsy-bitsy, baby?
Come and get it, you greasy little tick.
Oh, my God! I'm going to pupate!
You so fine, baby.
Bloats up your crop, don't it, Joe?
Hey, Joe!
-What is it now?
-You seem a little down.
Are you okay?
Just great.
I'm lonely, my job sucks... and I'm in love with a girl who's got a boyfriend.
My life has totally turned to shit.
Funny thing about shit, Joe.
-Good stuff grows out of it.
-Yeah, right.
You don't believe me?
Check out that bag in the corner.
Where do you want this stupid bush?
Right over there.
Isn't this great, Blank?
This is not my thing.
Why did I say yes to this?
For you.
Elephicalia vermilius?
I did my senior thesis on this flower.
It's only found in Sri Lankan elephant habitats.
It loves rotting, moist conditions.
You know....
It's a terrific planting for the garden.
Good.
Thanks.
What's "P.I.S. & S?"
It's the bank I work for.
"Prudential lnvestment Stocks and Security Savings...."
I thought you played in a band.
I do.
But... banking is kind of like my trade.
I'm sort of a rock-and-roll banker.
You wear these overalls to work?
What's this?
Those are super-mulching pellets.
Great for growing things.
-I've never seen them before.
-It's a new technology.
Could you get some of these for the garden?
As many as you want!
Thank you.
You're great.
On one condition:
You come see my band tomorrow night.
I can put you on the list.
I don't know.
Come on.
Can't resist a man in a uniform.
Thank you for tuning into Alternative Life.
New York's only truly underground forum.
We continue last week's discussion:
"How can we promote better understanding between species?"
Lay off the rat jokes!
How many rats does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How'd you like a punch in the beak, wise guy?
Lay off the bird, sewer breath!
Go gnaw some nuts!
Can 't we all just get along?
No!
Now, guys--
-Out of the way.
-We're watching Charlie Roach.
I've got a date tonight.
Is she cute?
-About time, Joey!
-Porkola time, buddy.
-So I want you to stay out of sight.
-Who, us?
-Sure, Joey.
-No problem, Joe.
-You got the place to yourself.
-We're Gandhi.
I'll forget every horrible thing you've ever done to me if you disappear tonight.
-Just disappear.
-We're on the same team.
Forget about it.
I mean it.
Thanks, Joe.
Look at that piece of meat.
That is some dope shit, Joe.
Look at that, Joe!
-That hit the spot.
-Complements to the chef.
Joe's first date!
Let's make it special.
-Great idea, Ralph.
-Special, sure.
I'm in favor.
Come on, buddy, that's it.
Let's get him over the curb.
Mr. Smith?
It's a hostile takeover.
Ten minutes ago this company became a wholly-owned subsidiary... of Featherstone Feminine Products.
They're going to shut down the whole urinal cake division!
Don't forget to take this.
This way, gentlemen. Roll it over here.
My whole life's work!
Ruined!
That's right.
The days of trickle-down economics are over.
Ladies and gentlemen. It's loud, it's bad... it's Shit!
Easy crowd.
Oh, a new drummer.
Yeah, I hope he's good.
Hit it!
I'm sorry!
There won't be any rock-and-roll tonight.
This is all that's left!
This feeble wimped-out death rattle... is all that remains of the rolling thunder... of America's heartbeat!
It wasn't that bad.
Yes, it was.
Maybe you should stick to banking, after all.
I'm not a banker. I'm not a drummer.
I can't even keep a job collecting urinal cakes.
I'm just... nothing.
I think you're something.
-Why aren't you with your boyfriend?
-What boyfriend?
The guy I saw you kiss in the garden a few days ago.
He's probably home kissing my mother.
He's my dad.
The lot is completely planted.
The community is behind it, the flowers are starting to bloom.
Now I just have to show it to my father... and show him something good can come out of the neighborhood... and it's worth saving.
Do you want to come to my place?
I've got a towel you could use.
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk
Baby, I got the love
Baby, I got the power
Come on, girl, and rock my world
And my funky towel
Baby, got the love
Baby, got the howl
Let's get down to party town
And my funky towel
Thick and funky
Steamin ' up the dance floor
Get on up and shake that thing
Everybody's gettin ' what they ask for
Everybody, everybody, sing
Sing, sing, sing
Welcome to Joey's toilet
-Make yourself at home.
-Thanks.
I've got a towel....
What are you doing?
Having a party, what does it look like?
I'm serious. I want you out of here!
-Joe, my brother!
-Thanks, Joey!
-What say there?
-Bust a move.
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk
Okay, I'm dancing. Now, beat it. Leave.
You just flushed the rhythm section out to Coney lsland.
So follow them out there. Lily's here.
She is?
My towels are in the laundry.
Oh, that's fine.
So... do you live here alone?
Yep. Nobody here but us.
Guys, you promised.
Come on, baby, light my fire.
-Up periscope.
-Music, maestro.
How about a smooch, baby?
Your place is so comfy.
Shut up.
I mean... drink up.
Down the hatch, sweetie.
Here's to life's little surprises.
I think you'll need one of these, Joe.
Pretzel nugget?
Bon appetit.
What a lover!
A real Casanova.
Go get her.
I beg your pardon?
Feeling better?
Well, I'm... still a little wet.
-What's going on?
-Don't push.
I'm sorry. I hope you don't catch cold.
-She wants it.
-I smell victory.
At least it wasn't a downpour.
Steady there!
-Steady!
-Don't tip it!
Let me out of here!
No, no! Wait!
Oh, my God!
Lily, come back!
Oh, my God.
My garden.
My father was right.
This place does deserve to be a prison.
The East Village sucks!
We're really sorry, man.
-We're sorry.
-We didn't mean it.
Tough break, buddy.
We didn't know.
Beer, Joe? Oh, sorry.
She'll never speak to me again.
Come on. There'll be others, Joe.
I don't want any others. I want Lily.
I want to die.
Look on the bright side.
You always got us.
All right.
That's it.
I'm getting rid of you roaches once and for all.
Wait. Don't be rash.
I'll kill every last one of you!
We're family!
Well, I guess this means war.
Joe, let's talk.
This is all I have to say to you, Ralph.
-He's got a bomb!
-Run for your lives!
No! Don't do it!
My babies! My babies!
One, two, three, heave!
Heave!
Careful, soldier, don't lose your head.
Oh, Joe's little dolly got hurt.
Red alert!
Armored force, attack!
Let her go!
Timber!
-What the....
-Hello, Joe.
Now can we talk?
-You go first.
-No, you go first.
Goddamn, you little sons of bitches!
Get the hell out of my apartment!
Listen to that.
-Your apartment?
-I believe we were here first.
We'll be here last, too.
We got a long-term lease on this planet.
Roaches will be crawling on the daisy popping out of the last rotting human.
God, you're disgusting!
Like you humans are any kind of fucking prize!
What makes you so much better than us?
War, pollution, New Age music!
I suppose those things are our fault?
We just want to say two things. First:
We're sorry we ruined your life. Second:
Goodbye.
-Toodles.
-Sayonara.
What do you mean "goodbye"?
-We took a big risk talking to you.
-Since you faked our friendship... you can't walk off knowing what you know.
Painful decision, Joe.
Wait!
Here, roachy, roachy.
Going to miss you.
I was kidding.
-Any last words?
-Don't kill me.
Those are the last words?
Ready! Aim!
Ralph! Rodney!
Help!
Big deal. Please hold.
So what? Please hold.
Don't make me laugh. Please hold.
No, ma'am.
I think you should take the shrapnel out before you cauterize.
-I don 't think I can do it.
-Please hold.
Central Complaint Department.
I'd like to speak to Lily Dougherty.
Lily's not here.
Will she be back soon?
No. She's sick.
Sick?
She's sick of her job.
And she's sick of New York City.
And she's sick of having her stupid daydreams dashed to pieces.
And what makes her sickest... is the unspeakably rotten things some people do to other people... just when she was beginning to like them!
Lily, is that you?
No.
Lily quit.
Lily, it's Joe!
Lily!
Ralph!
Rodney!
I don't care if you can hear me or not, Ralph!
But you can keep this goddamn city!
I'm going back to lowa!
Here's a souvenir to take with you.
So long, sucker.
I love the real estate business.
The place looks great.
Sure it does, Ralph. Where's Joe?
Around here someplace, I suppose.
Joe!
Joe, speak to me!
Who did this to you?
We did, Ralph. We ran out on him just when he needed us most.
We behaved no better than a bunch of people.
We got to make it up to him.
Let's find him a new place.
We got to get Lily back, too.
Forget that, I'm a cockroach, not Santa Claus.
Ralphie, I'm surprised at you.
Does this mean you're giving up?
Give up? Give up?
What are you saying to me?
How come us roaches have been able to outlast the dinosaurs?
How do we survive poison and persecution?
How do we keep on crawling in the face of the world in arms?
How?
I'll tell you how.
Because we never give up!
A true cockroach never gives up!
They can stomp us, they can pop us, but they'll never ever stop us!
Some day, the great H-bomb will drop, and we'll have the planet to ourselves!
I don't care if we call in favors from every roach, rat and pigeon in New York.
We aren't giving up on Joe!
-Great speech, Ralph!
-Truly righteous, brother.
Where's the stapler?
-I need five copies.
-How do you spell "memorandum"?
Boot it up.
Anybody got a 1942 W-440?
Special delivery.
This is giving me hay fever.
Hey, watch the potholes, homes.
Excuse me, sir. Mind if we borrow this?
Tubular!
Wash out!
Sewer surfing
Under-turfing
We get our kicks while we're hanging six
On a sewer surfing holiday
We're surfing, we're sewer surfing
Shoo-shoo
Shooting the tube
We are going to get there
Shooting the tube
Hitting the loo
We're dirtier than you
We are shooting the tube
Are you sure this is the right address?
Yes, Daddy.
"324 1/2 East 8th Street.
"Prison dedication, 9:00 a.m."
Funny, I could have sworn this was an empty lot.
-Hi, Lily.
-Joe!
What's all this?
I guess it's sort of... mine.
And I'm giving it to you.
Is it okay?
It's wonderful, but how did you....
My friends helped.
I see.
Lily, you were right.
This park will do more for the Lower East Side than 1,000 prisons.
My boy, you've done my old neighborhood a great service.
It was all her idea, Senator.
Come on.
My friends... this extraordinary garden... is the first blossom of this neighborhood's rebirth.
What is this?
Kill that lying, two-timing Senator Dougherty. Tonight.
Whack his daughter and that damn kid, too.
See all these people here?
Dead by the end of the week.
And that little girl over there--
Mr. Shirt!
Let me show you a hot new property.
Welcome to Lily Park!
There's an extra toothbrush in the cupboard.
Oh, really, don't bother.
It's the least I could do.
Your house burned down.
I'll set you up on the couch.
Joe, you're practically inside.
Ralph!
-Little last minute advice.
-Get lost, Ralph!
Look into her eyes and say:
"Baby, I'm going to bop you till your ears bleed! "
Did you need something?
No, thanks.
Play your cards right, Joe, and this could be our new pad.
"Our new pad"? You little....
We busted ass for you!
What kind of thanks do we get?
Ralph... thanks.
For everything.
Forget it. Sorry about our little misunderstanding back there.
Me, too. Now, how about a little privacy?
Take my advice, just grab her by--
Gosh, Lily, you look incredible.
-How about a little help here?
-No. I mean it.
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen in my life.
I bet you say that to all the girls the minute you get them alone.
We are alone, aren't we?
Last I looked.
Oh, please, let me.
I can make the bed myself.
Really? Have you ever made a bed in your life?
Sure, watch this.
Swinging pad!
What do you think, Rodney?
Brother Ralph...
I believe that we have finally reached the promised penthouse!
Brother bugs and sister insects!
Come on with it, Rodney!
Give a shout out to the Great Big Bug.
With his help, we can turn this antiseptic sanctuary... into a putrid paradise!
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, pull me through
Pull me through
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, pull me through
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, till I join that golden horde
I'll be hanging
Hanging onto you
Lily, now that we're alone,
I should tell you...
I'm sorry about what happened at my apartment.
My friends are sorry, too.
Friends?
I never thought I'd say this, but they're actually kind of sweet.
They must like you a lot.
Not as much as I like you.
Go, Joe!
We've been battered
And we've been scattered
We've been splattered into goo
-But the healer, he took my feeler
-Praise the Lord, hallelujah!
And he really pulled me through
-Oh, he pulled me through
-Oh, that feeler
When I cash my chips and pay the dealer
I'll be holding onto the Lord's feeler, too
Hold my feeler
And my antenna, too
I've been down and I've been trampled
And dug myself down deep in a hole
But I was lifted
By the love of that Great Big Bug
With his feelers 'round my soul
Whoa, Lord
Won 't you hold my feeler?
Hold my feeler and pull me through
I want you to feel my feeler!
My Lord, there 's nothing realer
Joe, that tickles.
Than my ever-loving feeler feeling you
So! So long from Joe's apartment
We're sad to see you go
Thanks for coming, it's been swell
Check back into our motel
Hope you didn 't mind the smell
Joe's apartment our own sweet home
Shit!
Oh, God!
- What time did you get back?
- You don't want to know.
Was it worth it?
Did he sign the contract?
- Yes.
- What a genius. How did you do it?
I did it the old-fashioned way.
I begged.
Good morning, Roy and Mary.
What time's my doctor's appointment?
I had no idea you had one.
- Coffee, Roy?
- Yeah. Are you sick?
- A wolf bit me.
- I just asked.
- Are you going to Alden's party?
- Probably.
He invites everybody over to let them know if they still have a job.
You have no appointment.
But he'll see you before 12.
If you get the axe tonight,
I go with you.
- So do I.
- Listen, you need your pay cheques.
I forbid you to take any action if I'm fired.
Right. Maude Waggins is waiting in your office.
I cannot write for a conglomerate.
Protect me.
Raymond Alden isn't a conglomerate, he's a billionaire.
And I'm not sure if I'm going to be here after the takeover.
You're the senior editor.
Your name, your reputation...
My reputation has been in question ever since I told Judith Krantz -
- that no 14-year-old would read her fiction.
- Bullshit!
- Sit down. Maude.
The good news is that the head of marketing is my friend and protÃ©gÃ©.
If I leave. He'll leave with me.
I know they don't want to lose him.
That may give me some leverage.
I'll leave with you, too!
Howâs that for leverage?
Let's go and see your protÃ©gÃ©.
Willie.
Just the man I wanted to see.
Maude Waggins.
You saved my life. While reading
"What About Us Girls?"...
- You realized you had to write.
- No, I stopped.
I realized that if this was talent.
I had none.
- How nice that it should stop you.
- I adore you.
- I taught him to do that.
- I used to hit my authors.
Maude wants in if we leave. Do you know what her contract calls for?
She's obligated to one more book.
We get first look at her next two.
How about an 80-page reminiscence of all the restaurants I've loved?
There are no specifications in the contract.
I'll start eating out right now.
You are a rarity. A loyal man, with a great taste in authors.
Bye, Will. I'll see you at Jason's.
You're such a polished ass-kisser it takes my breath away.
I kiss 'em like I see 'em.
A wolf in Vermont.
I don't think so. Will.
You weren't there.
You sure it wasn't a husky?
After all. It was dark out.
There was a full moon.
It was a wolf.
I was staring straight at it.
You don't confuse a dog with a wolf.
I see. Funny, this isn't the first rabies shot I've given recently.
My wife's sister-in-law in Oneonta, a raccoon bit her in the ass.
My friend's son sustained brain damage from a snake bite.
He was by the pool, next thing he has brain damage.
- Is he all right?
- No, you idiot, he's brain damaged.
I see Time-Warner as a bunch of decent caring people.
Money doesn't always imply ruthless ambition. Am I insane?
I would say so, yes.
He's so charming.
Because the rainforest is being destroyed so rapidly, -
- all these viruses are going to colonize the world.
They'll kill off the population.
I'm only quoting "The New Yorker".
Everyone's trying to say the world will end if we have no rainforests.
You could make a case that the world has already ended. That art is dead.
Instead of art we have pop culture and daytime TV.
Women who've been raped by their dentists confiding in Oprah.
An exploration in depth of why women cut off their husbands' penises.
- Time to fill up the glass.
- Yes. Let's have a drink.
Relax. Eat something.
At least get a meal out of this.
I didn't like the food.
All that red meat dripping blood.
- You're fun to eat with.
- Mr. Alden would like to see you.
"Never send to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls..."'
Will... just remember who you are.
Charm him. You can be charming when you want to.
- Why is he doing it this way?
- It's kinder face-to-face.
- Cigar?
- Don't mind if I do.
I want you to think about Europe.
Eastern Europe, particularly.
There's a whole new market opening up there.
God and currency willing, the entire continent will cohere.
Both economically and culturally.
I want that to be your area.
I see...
Then my area will no longer be editor-in-chief after the takeover?
There's nothing personal, you know that.
You're clearly a man of taste and individuality.
But these days, all around the globe, -
- taste and individuality are actually a handicap.
Then what of my successor?
Is he a vulgar conformist?
Drive. Hustle. Drive and 52-carat ambition.
He nagged me day and night until I gave him your job.
Well. For what it's worth. Here's what I've learned in 30 years:
Treat the authors as human beings.
Don't stint on review copies.
Don't hold them to deadlines.
They'll only turn in rough drafts.
Thank you, I'll remember that.
You're a nice person, Will.
Thank God I replaced you.
I hope you give
Eastern Europe a shot.
You'd better put that out.
Horses don't like it.
- I think I'll finish it.
- Go ahead. Good cigar, isn't it?
This is the prize. Fort Knox.
Drink it.
Good boy.
I'm afraid I... finished your drink.
What are you?
The last civilized man?
I'm...
...just embarrassed.
Half the people here use Thorazine, so a little anxiety is okay.
- You're very kind.
- No. I'm not.
I'm Laura Alden. Alden is my father.
- I'm Will Randall.
- Nice to meet you.
- You don't seem surprised.
- Not tonight.
- He just fired you, didn't he?
- Demoted is the word.
I have a choice between no job and a job no one would want.
- What will you do?
- Take the job no one would want.
I don't have the courage to be jobless at my age.
Old guy?
Yeah... Old guy.
Well... I'd better get back.
Was that on purpose?
No... You're perfectly safe.
I'm married.
- And that makes you perfectly safe?
- Yes...
You better clean yourself up if you're gonna face the crowd.
Here, wipe your face.
It's all sweaty.
There you are, dear.
All ready for company.
Thank you.
How did it go?
Speak, we've been going nuts.
First, let me say congratulations on being the new editor-in-chief.
What...? Alden said that?
What did he say?
He called this evening and told me he wanted me to take the job.
I said that it was your job.
I didn't know if he was serious.
I didn't ask for this.
Say the word, I'll turn it down.
- What should I do?
- That's up to you, Stewart.
No, it's up to you.
I'll do whatever you say.
You're asking the one person who can't advise you.
Shit! I'm sorry you said that.
That son of a bitch! Prick!
I had no idea he was offered your job.
Alden must have made a good offer, but he could have told you.
Why didn't you say something?
You let him walk away guilt-free.
Charlotte, please...
I can't talk now.
May I just say one more thing about it?
No.
Will. Come on. It's 7:30.
Give me till eight.
Will?
It's 7:40.
I asked you to give me till eight.
It's 7:40 at night, you dope.
You've slept all day.
Are you all right?
How do you feel?
I feel...
...good.
I said, "Why assign me mastectomies and estrogen therapy?"
"Let me do genetic engineering.
Give Pete mastectomies."
You know what he said? "You'll do it so much better, you're a woman."
I said, "That's like telling a black food-writer..." Hey!
I have to catch up.
I haven't eaten. I haven't drunk.
I haven't made love in a long time.
A very long time.
Do you think we ought to do it right here in front of the church?
- What else do you do without hands?
- You'll see.
What was in that stew?
- Good morning.
- It's a bit early to be drinking?
- How the fuck did you know?
- You can smell it a mile away.
- Mr. Randall, are you all right?
- Perfectly.
I heard about Alden's decision.
I'm so sorry.
- Was Stewart just in here?
- Not just. About an hour ago.
That's how I found out.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- I want to say I think it sucks.
- Thank you, Roy.
What did you do, get contacts?
I'll be damned...
You've edited about 60 pages since Monday. What are you on?
Nothing.
I just caught up on my sleep.
I got 20 hours of sleep and I feel 20 years younger.
And so now you can see without your glasses?
Yeah, you've got a point.
You know what he said?
"How could you drink this early?"
I put some tequila in my coffee and he said he smelled it.
- Alden replaced Randall.
- Are you sure?
It's official. Will Randall's out
Stewart Swinton's in.
Get me Gary on the phone.
- A manual on owning animals?
- No. Animal possession.
Demonic possession.
Possession of the spirit by animals.
Give me a minute.
- How many do you want?
- One, the most respectable.
Vijav Alezais wrote "Something Wild" in 1948.
- Old but breathing.
- He's not some kind of mystic?
No. He has letters after his name.
In fact. He's Doctor Alezais.
Thank you.
Give his number to Mary, please.
And, Gary, don't tell people you had tequila with your coffee.
You didn't have coffee this morning.
Hi, I made it to New Haven.
I'll be home tomorrow.
If you get hungry, there's some left over stew.
Let's see if it still works, you animal!
- Yes?
- It's Will.
I'll come down.
Hey, Will. What's going on?
What is it?
What's wrong?
What did he...
I'm sorry.
I'll get dressed.
- Good morning, Mr. Randall.
- I've moved to the Mayflower.
- Is that permanent?
- Yes.
Call legal and find out if the deal with Alden is closed.
Get Roy to come over with a list of every author he's ever worked with.
And a list of every author
I've ever worked with.
Call Alden and get me an appointment this afternoon.
Is the worm turning?
- The worm is now packing an Uzi.
- It's about fucking time.
Shall I resign today? Promise never to see Charlotte again?
- Just tell me what to do.
- Resign today.
I can't do that.
So why did I say it?
I guess it's just a way of telling you...
...how bad I feel about being such a shit.
I love you, Will.
I know how that sounds. But I do.
I know how much I've hurt you and it kills me.
I know I can't...
- You'll never forgive me, will you?
- No.
I'd still like one thing.
Your permission to call Alden and tell him to forget Eastern Europe.
To keep you on as a consultant.
May I do that for you?
I'm gonna get you, Stewart.
The deal is not officially closed.
Mr. Alden will see you at 12:30.
Roy, ask your list of authors about forming a publishing partnership.
Tell them we're leaving MacLeish House, -
- whose new policy is to bury everything that doesn't sell.
- Tell them we've got investors.
- Two things.
- How many investors do we have?
- I don't know.
But I say it anyway.
Is any of this true?
- Not yet.
- You're my God.
You'd better start calling writers.
Begin with Maude.
Mr. Randall.
I wanted to tell you that
I'm turning down Eastern Europe.
I more or less thought you would.
Nice seeing you again, sir.
- Are you all right?
- Are you crazy?
Stay away from animals when you know they're frightened of you!
Didn't you realize that on Monday?
Your presence disturbs them.
- I just wanted to say hello.
- You haven't fallen in years.
Here you still are.
Did you get lost?
- No.
- We were talking.
Henry and Caroline are here.
I told them you'd join us.
Did you? What a pity,
I'm having lunch with... Will.
It doesn't really matter to Laura what your name is, Mr. Randall.
What is important is that you're unemployed and I disapprove of you.
- We're going to miss your company.
- Yes. I know.
Shall we start cooking?
Your place?
A guest house.
I stay here when I'm in town.
I only have peanut butter and jelly.
We'll have to cancel lunch.
Peanut butter and jelly is mother's milk to me.
Whatever you think is going to happen, isn't.
Don't take anything for granted because we exchanged a few words.
I don't take anything for granted, except perhaps a little civility.
So what do you do?
Why do you care?
I don't. I was just making polite conversation.
I'd rather not discuss what I do.
I think I understand what you're like now.
You think men are only interested in you because you're beautiful.
But you want them to be interested in you.
The problem is that you're not very interesting.
You're rude, you're hostile, you're sullen, you're withdrawn...
I know you want someone to look past all that to what's underneath.
But the only reason anyone would bother is because you're beautiful.
Ironic, isn't it? In an odd way you are your own problem.
Sorry, wrong line.
I'm not shocked by your keen insight and suddenly challenged by you.
Shall we have the rest of our milk in the living room?
Are all these you?
Yes, my father keeps this cottage empty just for me, -
- so I can stay as far away from him as possible.
The pictures were thrown in by the decorator. He had a mawkish side.
- Is this you?
- My mother. She died when I was 12.
I'm sorry.
And this?
My brother. He died last year.
Yes... I remember.
He had some kind of an accident.
No. He killed himself.
He was diagnosed borderline schizophrenic.
I guess he got tired of the title.
He lived with me on and off.
- Nice face.
- Yeah...
He was pretty nice for a little brother.
This is really something.
Isn't it?
This is where I used to come to bury my pets.
And this is where I realized that one day I would die.
Standing right here on this spot,
I realized one day I would be over.
I want to tell you something.
A few days ago, something happened to me.
I was driving in New England and I hit an animal.
- A wolf.
- In New England? Are you sure?
I'm positive.
When I tried to touch it. It bit me.
- Did you get checked for rabies?
- Yes. I'm fine.
This will really sound insane.
The wolf passed something on to me.
A scrap of its spirit in my blood.
My senses are suddenly so acute.
I feel just so... great.
I'm just not the kind of person who walks around feeling great.
I'm more alive. Stronger.
- It sounds strange, but...
- It's better than living in Bosnia.
No, I wasn't going to say that.
I was going to say that...
If you feel great, maybe you should just accept it as a gift.
I'm afraid it will have a price.
There is that.
Would you like to stay for dinner?
If not peanut butter and jelly, and I won't tell my father.
Yes.
- Let's get back before it's dark.
- Are you cold?
No. But we will be.
What is it?
- Here. Sit down.
- I think... I want to get inside.
It's not that far.
Here. Lean on me.
Listen, I'm an almost-professional psychiatric nurse.
Elevated, but you'll live.
Is this another attack?
I don't know.
Don't be upset with me if I tell you this, okay?
You are beautiful.
And the nicest girl...
Can I get you something to eat?
- I can't eat.
- Then go to sleep.
The next thing you know it'll be morning and I'll make coffee.
- Eggs and toast.
- Bacon.
You think I can't get bacon?
I just may surprise you.
- I don't know where I'm going.
- Someplace nice.
- Any idea how this happened?
- None.
- Do you ever sleepwalk?
- Not that I know of.
It sounds like you took a walk in your sleep and fell down.
There's some lacerations back here.
Nothing bleeds like the scalp.
I'll have you in for an EEG and a CAT scan.
- You'll have to be in overnight.
- Impossible.
You could have a concussion.
No one feels this good with a concussion.
So good to see you again so soon. Sir.
It's nice to see you too, Will.
Robert Keyes, my counsel.
- Counselor, nice to meet you.
- Sit down. Will.
You're deliberately goading some of our top writers -
- to become part of some totally improbable scheme.
And being writers, they're too damn stupid to know it.
They might not succeed, but it won't hurt them to try.
And if they fail, any publisher will be glad to get them.
It doesn't matter if we start a new publishing house or go to another.
At least seven top writers are going to leave MacLeish House.
My press release in the morning will see this firm's reputation collapse.
- You're worse than Stewart.
- Yes.
But I have two big drawbacks:
Taste and individuality.
Maybe I can overlook them.
All right.
Call it off. Keep your job.
I'd never have fired you if I'd known you were this ruthless.
I want a deal memo granting me additional powers and monies.
By tomorrow morning.
- I won't agree to that.
- You will. I'd do the same.
- I'll tell Stewart.
- Wait until the deal is signed.
Then I'll tell Stewart.
- Did you contact Miss Alden?
- Not yet.
- Any appointments?
- Doctor Alezais at 4.
He's called three times to confirm.
He sounds like he's over 100.
If you want to cancel, you'll have to do it yourself.
I was just boiling water for tea.
Perhaps you will join me. Come.
- I won't take much of your time.
- Take. I am not a busy man.
You were bitten by a wolf in Vermont on March 8th.
Very auspicious.
- Very suspicious?
- Auspicious. Very auspicious.
March 8th. The moon was the closest it's been to earth in 100 years.
Well... that is auspicious.
What I'm curious about is...
Could my symptoms be caused by chemicals released from a wolf bite?
Something that medical science has overlooked.
Among my people there is only one explanation for your symptoms.
That you are becoming a wolf.
But... you don't believe that...
Why not?
Remember, man has only been out of the jungle for 25,000 years.
Please. Sit down.
Life is mystical.
It's just that we are used to it.
Catholicism itself.
A religion so mystical -
- that even primitive tribes can be converted to it.
The return after death.
Judgement Day, Heaven and Hell.
All so incredible and so ordinary.
But we are used to it.
- Honey, sugar, Sweet N' Low?
- Anything. Honey.
I don't have honey.
Visit a shaman.
He'll tell you the rules.
I can only tell you the theory.
- Do you know any of the rules?
- Very few.
The wolf rests by day and prowls by night.
But he's always present.
He grows inside a man he's entered until the first full moon.
Then he consumes him. Killing all but his nature and his heart.
Not a great prognosis.
Of course.
Not all who are bitten change.
There must be something wild within.
An analogue of the wolf.
Among my people, I'm not known for having an analogue of a wolf.
Your people are wrong. Sometimes one doesn't even need to be bitten.
Only the passion of the wolf is enough.
Dr. Alezais...
I'd like to know...
Not that I subscribe to this...
Neither do I.
Only to the possibility.
But out of curiosity...
Is there supposed to be any way to stop this metamorphosis?
Supposedly there are herbs and rites and amulets.
I don't know the rites.
I don't have the herbs.
But I did find something for you when you called.
This is one of the most powerful amulets.
It must be worn next to the skin and never taken off.
If it works. There is said to be great pain and weakness.
The wolf struggles to emerge, and the charm holds him at bay.
I have no idea if any of it is true, but it's yours.
It's a gift.
And in return
I would like a favour from you.
If it's in my power.
I was recently told that I am dying.
Speaking of mystical and terrifying experiences.
I would like you to bite me.
- What?
- I would like you to bite me.
I can't ask you to transform me with your passions.
But I ask you to honour me with your bite.
I. Too. Will become a demon wolf.
You'd rather be damned than die?
Damnation is not a part of my system of beliefs.
The demon wolf is not evil unless the man he's bitten is evil.
And it feels good to be a wolf, doesn't it?
Power without guilt.
Love without doubt.
Excuse me, I just can't.
I understand.
Keep the amulet.
If you decide to believe, -
- perhaps you will give me your gift.
It has been a privilege.
I've never seen one like you.
- Hello?
- I've been trying to call...
Don't hang up.
Let me explain.
I'm not a fan of men who mysteriously disappear.
I had an accident.
I sleepwalked last night.
I hit my head. I drove to the doctor's at 6 o'clock.
But you didn't come and tell me?
No, it was 6 o'clock in the morning and I had a scalp wound.
I didn't want you to take care of me again.
Finish drying yourself.
The towel's driving me crazy.
Can you hear that?
Yes, it's one of my new gifts.
Laura, please... can I see you?
Can we have dinner tomorrow?
I'm at the Mayflower.
Laura?
I'll be there tomorrow at six.
You'd better look like you fell.
I do!
Room 825. What did you...
...make me for breakfast?
I'm not only the president of the Hair Club for Men. -
- I'm also a member.
Hold it right there.
Put your hands on the cage.
Spread your legs.
He's clean.
Put your hands behind your back.
- Did you see that?
- He got my cuffs.
- Wait up!
- Have you got any money?
- Loan us some money.
- All of you?
Yeah...
I've got about $1,000 in my wallet.
How much would you like to borrow?
Give me the wallet.
Morning, this is Alice with your8 o'clock wake up.
You must have been bad last night
I've been ringing you forever.
As a matter of fact. Alice.
I was a very good boy last night.
I went to bed...
...so early,
I don't even remember.
- Big boys here yet?
- Conference room. Deal in hand.
Don't even pretend to have any doubts.
It's a pleasure doing business with you, sir.
Will... I talked to Mr. Alden about your consultant position.
It's less pay of course, but so is Eastern Europe.
Thanks. But I've had a better offer.
- Really? What house?
- This one.
- I don't understand...
- I did the same thing you did.
I nagged Alden until he gave me your job.
- When? I don't understand.
- In my spare time.
I guess I owe you some congratulations.
I guess the best man won.
I'm glad in a way.
I couldn't have given it up.
And I didn't like the way I got it.
I hope we can work together without rancor.
You're fired. Stewart.
Don't. Will. It'll ruin me.
I know. But it's best for the firm.
Give me a few months.
Let me say I quit.
No.
It wouldn't be best for the firm.
You vindictive son of a bitch!
The best thing for the firm is me.
I'm the best thing this firm has, and you fucking know it!
- Are you crazy?
- No.
I'm just marking my territory, and you got in the way.
Nice.
Real nice.
- Suede shoes.
- Asparagus.
Will...
Please, can I talk to you for a moment?
A moment of your time for 16 years.
That's pretty cheap.
- What do you want?
- I want to come back.
I have no excuse. I deserve anything you do to me.
I'm just begging you to be kind.
Has Stewart become unlovable now that he's out of my job?
I never loved Stewart.
It was a mistake. Will.
I'm going to talk to him.
Stewart never for one moment meant anything to me.
And you think that makes it better?
You betrayed me with a man -
- that meant nothing to you?
You betrayed me for nothing.
- Don't be so smug.
- Don't touch me.
Keep away.
Hi, I thought I'd just come on up.
Have you been waiting for me?
I can't see you.
Open the door.
You can't do this to me twice.
Open it!
I wonder if you could do me a favour...
- Please go.
- Why? What happened?
What have you done?
Where did you get those?
I want you to go.
No.
- Tell me why you've done this.
- It's getting late.
I think I'm dangerous, especially at night.
You're afraid that when it gets dark, you'll attack me?
Yeah.
I think I'm turning into... something else.
Into the thing that bit you?
Into the wolf?
- Tell me where the key is.
- I don't have a key.
I don't even know where I got the handcuffs.
You don't have a key?
What was your plan? To sit chained to the radiator until you grew paws?
God... you almost make this seem like it isn't happening.
I don't have a plan.
I didn't think past not hurting anyone.
- I don't think I can open these.
- You don't know about me.
When you're a druggie and a delinquent, -
- and you want to get Daddy, you get arrested.
You come into contact with the criminal element of society.
You pick up shit you think you're never going to need.
Then one day you meet a guy who chains himself to the radiator.
Why do you want any of this nightmare?
You mean instead of the gaiety of my normal life?
I don't know.
Because I like you.
Because you're a good man.
And that's very exotic to me.
I never thought I'd meet a good man who looked at me the way you do.
- You don't know I'm a good man.
- Yes. I do.
Then why is this happening?
I thought only the evil were cursed.
No. Not at all.
I could've told you that.
The worst things happen to the best people.
I almost had it.
You might consider -
- that you're not cursed at all, that you're sick.
There are brain tumors that can cause all of your symptoms.
Tumors? What are you saying?
Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- God, if only that could be true.
How we lower our sights.
I say we get you examined for physical causes, -
- before we take for granted that you're becoming...
There we go. On your feet.
Let's get you re-handcuffed.
- Maybe it isn't necessary.
- Hands behind your back.
There.
You seem pretty helpless now.
- Yes.
- Great.
Interesting. What is it?
- It's a good luck charm.
- Really?
Does it work?
Well.
Today isn't turning out too bad.
- Laura...
- Yes?
Nothing... not a thing.
- Who is it?
- Police.
Detective Sergeant Bridger, NYPD.
- Is William Randall here?
- Why? What's wrong?
- I'd rather tell Mr. Randall.
- He's in the shower.
Is it okay if I come in and wait?
There's... some kind of a problem.
I understand. I'm Will Randall.
I'm renting the apartment.
About the noise last night...
He's not the hotel manager.
He's a police detective.
Could we talk in private?
That won't be necessary.
This is Miss Smith, my fiancÃ©e.
She can hear anything that you have to say.
Your wife was found dead this morning.
I'm sorry.
She was murdered last night.
Her body was found in the park.
- How was she killed?
- Her throat was torn out.
- Sit down.
- No... I want to stand up.
Would you mind telling me when you saw your wife last?
Last night, here in the lobby.
- About six.
- Did you argue?
- Don't answer anything else, Will.
- I'm trying to get the facts.
The clerk said
Mr. Randall and his wife had argued.
So you already know they argued.
These are not straight questions.
Could I ask about Mr. Randall's whereabouts last night?
Mr. Randall was with me last night.
I arrived at 6:30 and didn't leave.
Check that with the desk.
I will.
We've taken some blood and tissue samples from your... the victim.
It would really help if you would submit some samples...
- Not without a court order.
- Just a request.
Here's my number.
In case you want to reach me.
I'd like you to come down to the station and give a statement.
- Both of you.
- All right.
Thank you for your cooperation.
He's got an alibi.
The girl says she was with him.
- Airtight?
- It depends on who the girl is.
Charlotte Randall was wife of the senior editor of MacLeish House, -
- recently purchased by Raymond Alden.
Police have no suspects in custody at this time.
- My God!
- I hope they don't go after Will.
Why should they?
He's the husband and they were separated.
It wouldn't be great for the stock.
It could be a bonanza for the stock.
The heat, the gossip.
- That's what publishing's about.
- Well, you handle it.
You're back in marketing.
Thank you, sir.
If they do go after Will, -
- and I hope that they don't,
I'd like to bid again for the job.
Randall has the right to name his own replacement.
He's named Roy Macallister.
I see.
Would that contract hold if Will was arrested?
Yes. Unless he's convicted. You'll have to keep your fingers crossed.
- I didn't mean...
- Really? What did you mean?
I hope to God Will is innocent.
And if he is. Screw the job.
But if he's guilty... screw Roy Macallister.
It's not much farther now.
- What if I killed her?
- What if you killed her?
Are you the guy I spent the night with? You look so much like him.
I could have gone out after you fell asleep.
Why does it always have to be the worst news?
The worst pain?
The worst defeat?
- Because... what if it is?
- It's not!
It's not.
They've left the hotel.
The night clerk identified the girl.
She's Laura Alden.
Howâs that for an alibi?
- Where are we?
- We're almost home.
Jesus! Where did the day go?
You'd better duck down.
- Hi. Miss Alden.
- Hi, George.
Stay down.
Hi. Tom.
Be careful of the woods.
There are some wild dogs.
- What do you mean?
- We found a deer they killed.
Thanks. I'll be careful.
Goodnight.
I want you to lock me up before it gets dark.
- Then what?
- Then maybe it won't happen.
I don't know where else to put you but the barn.
- Everything else has windows.
- The barn sounds good.
The barn sounds great.
I'm gonna beat this, Laura.
I'm gonna beat this.
Your phone is ringing.
- How do you know?
- I can hear it.
I'll be right back.
- Hello?
- Laura Alden?
- This is Detective Bridger.
- I know who you are.
- And we now know who you are.
- How long have you been ringing?
About two minutes. But I've been trying to reach you all day.
Tomorrow you'll give me the statement I asked for.
All right. Do you still want blood and tissue samples from Mr. Randall?
They'd be useless.
We've messed up the samples we took from the body.
What happened?
There was canine DNA in all the tissue samples.
The victim could have been mauled after she was killed.
Or maybe one of the lab assistants had been petting her dog.
You scared me.
You were right.
The phone was ringing.
It was that detective. Bridger.
He traced me and now he's threatening to subpoena me -
- if I don't give him a statement tonight.
Will you be all right if I go in?
Yes.
Don't look so scared.
Maybe there's happy endings even for people who don't believe in them.
I want you to know something.
I've never loved anybody this way.
I've never looked at a woman and thought:
If the world ends. I'll still understand what God meant -
- if I'm with her.
Laura Alden's coming in tonight.
It sounds like she's been crying.
I just got a call from
Randall's best friend.
- He wants to see me tonight.
- We've got a busy night.
The family of a kid who got his fingers torn off is out there.
- What is there about a full moon?
- More light.
If a rich, white boy had his fingers torn off, they'd do something.
- Laura Alden for Mr. Bridger.
- He's running behind.
- Miss Alden, take my seat.
- No.
- Please.
- No. I want to stand.
You don't know me. Stewart Swinton.
I'm a friend of Will Randall's.
I know who he is...
Well. I know his name.
This is a terrible thing.
I'm in shock over it.
Will was more than a friend.
He was my mentor.
- And you were his protÃ©gÃ©?
- Yes. A better word.
It's a true pleasure.
A very interesting scent you have.
At once new. And familiar.
Very familiar.
Thank you.
- Were you bitten?
- What?
What a very odd question.
What made you ask such a question?
I don't know... When people are bitten. It's often on the hand.
Why are you here?
They want some information about the publishing house.
Stewart Swinton!
Come on in.
Will you have a drink with me?
I'll tell you all about Will.
Thank you, that's very sweet.
I'd love to.
Wonderful.
- Don't break our date now.
- I won't.
This is not easy. Will Randall was a very dear friend of mine.
I'm not proud of what
I'm going to say.
Charlotte Randall and I...
This is hard.
Charlotte Randall and I were having an affair. It just happened.
And Will found out.
- Yes.
- Will there be anyone else?
There will only be the two of us.
I'll be flying with a sick friend.
Could you please have it as near the gate as possible?
In about an hour.
He was like a madman.
He was a madman. He bit me.
- He urinated on my shoe.
- Urinated...
He told me he would kill her.
I didn't believe him.
I blame myself.
If you're gonna hang a first-degree murder rap on Will, forget it.
This was true temporary insanity.
If Will is arrested.
I'll testify to that in his defense.
I understand.
He's staying at the Alden place with Miss Alden. Isn't he?
- I really must find him.
- Ask her. She's outside.
Laura Alden?
She's gone. She left right after
Mr. Swinton went in.
We don't need her.
Get a warrant for Randall.
Did he say
"on his shoe" or "in his shoe"?
No one gets through without a call!
No one!
The horses were restless tonight.
It's all right.
Steer clear of the barn tonight.
- Will you tell the others?
- Yes. Ma'am.
Can I help you?
- Mr. Swinton...
- I'm here to see Miss Alden.
I'm afraid I'll have to call.
May I ask your business?
Pleasure.
She'd be the fuck of the decade.
- Back up.
- All right.
Excuse me!
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Miss Alden.
You're not expected.
Really? I have a card...
...and an appointment. Here.
Hello. Miss Alden.
If you scream, I'II kill you.
I'll just break your neck, okay?
This is a surprise.
- How did you get in?
- I smooth-talked the guard.
If anyone could do it...
Don't play any more games.
You know, don't you?
- What?
- What's happening to me.
You're playing games with me.
You pretended not to know Will.
You know what happened to Charlotte.
All right, I do know Will and
I do know what's happening to you.
Will told me. When I asked him if there were any more like him.
- I'm not a fool. Laura.
- I know that.
If you find me so attractive, how about me fucking you right now?
- How would that be?
- I'd have to try it first.
Hello. Will.
Locked you up, did she?
- Is my daughter all right?
- I thought she was with you.
Laura!
I heard gunshots.
I was afraid to come out.
- Are you with Randall?
- Where's Randall?
As far as I know, he's on his way to Teterboro airport.
I told him I wasn't going with him.
He hung up on me.
We'd like to check the cottage.
- What's happening?
- They think Tom shot Swinton.
Laura. Tom is dead.
George, too, he was run down.
- With Stewart Swinton's car.
- He was after Will.
At the police station, he kept asking where Will was.
Laura Alden chartered a plane.
Swinton was looking for Randall.
He asked us if Randall was here.
When he found out that Laura Alden was gone, he took off.
All this might not have happened, -
- but I was against Randall, because he was after my daughter.
You were just trying to save me from a disastrous relationship.
It would only have lasted a week.
He was too tame for me.
That's what I thought when I saw you together at the Mayflower.
I hope this time you will give us a statement.
It would be my pleasure.
Could I get you something to drink, detective?
- Another vodka-tonic?
- Another... no. Thanks.
Let me know if you change your mind.
How did she know I'd been drinking?
I can smell it.
I can smell it a mile away.
People once believed that when someone dies... a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead.
But sometimes, something so bad happens... that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest.
Then, sometimes... just sometimes... the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right.
Hey, Sarge!
Yeah?
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.
Who the fuck gets married on Halloween anyhow?
Nobody.
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.
- All right, guys, let's do it.
- Devil's fuckin' Night.
- What's the count so far?
- 143 fires.
- They're slacking off from last year.
- Three hours to go.
- Maybe they're just slow starters.
- Coming through!
Yeah, I remember.
But you guys just can't come in here and take her away like this.
There are procedures to stick by.
You guys should have cleared this with me first.
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.
- We found her, Detective, and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.
I didn't give the order to move her.
Jesus, Albrecht. I can see why they took away your gold shield.
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.
All right, clear out of here.
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.
Tell him to take care of Sarah.
Look, I will. You just, uh, lie back. Come on, come on.
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.
Yeah, look. Your sister... she's gonna be okay.
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.
She's my friend.
Her and Eric.
- You lied to her about Eric.
- Look, I had to.
And you're lying to me about Shelly.
She's gonna die, isn't she?
Hey, uh...
Now, come on.
Come on, it's okay.
She's gonna be fine.
A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.
I used to think that was true about everything... families, friends, feelings.
But now I know that sometimes, if love proves real... two people who are meant to be together... nothing can keep them apart.
Later.
What are you, like the night watchman?
You know, what this place needs... is a good natural catastrophe.
- Earthquake, tornado, you know.
- No, no, no, no.
Mickey, come on, man. You... You got to put the mustard underneath first.
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.
Hey, hey, hey, let me do it.
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?
Come on. Come on, man.
Don't cheap out on me. Lots of onions.
- All right, here you go.
- Hey, all right.
Now we're talkin'.
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.
- How do you steer that thing on a wet street?
- Pure talent. Hi.
See, now, Sarah, she's a genuine hot dogger. You hungry?
- You buyin'?
- I'm buyin'.
- No onions though, okay?
- No onions?
They make you fart big time.
You know, Lake Erie actually caught on fire once... from all the crap floating around in it.
I wish I could have seen that.
Fire it up! Yeah!
- Fire it up! We busted their machines!
- Shit!
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T-Bird, cop car, cop car.
Bad people out on the street tonight.
- Damn it!
- Oh, my God!
- What was that?
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.
Mickey, call it in for me!
Gabriel!
- Eric?
- Department of Housing!
Code violations?
Safety hazards?
Place looks fine to me.
Let's redecorate.
"Abashed, the devil stood... and felt how awful goodness is.
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."
It's pornography.
Virtue?
Shelly?
- No! Eric!
- See ya!
No, no, no, no, me first.
Please.
- Shelly.
- Eric!
- Hey, that's good.
- That's good.
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?
Look at that.
Look at that.
Here's to Devil's Night, my new favourite holiday.
To Devil's Night.
You just go over there and tell your pals...
You sick fuck.
Are you out of your motherfuckin' mind, man?
Look at that!
Pussies drink last, man.
- Fuck you, Tin Tin.
- Hey.
That shit ain't even loaded, man.
This one is.
Which of you Motor City motherfuckers... wants to bet me this one isn't?
Hey, fire it up!
Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Here's your shooters.
Put your guns away, huh, guys?
- How ya doin'?
- Pussycat.
Boo.
- I love you.
- Say that again.
I love you.
Oh, boy.
Restaurant.
- Wow, you look great.
- Ta-da!
Yeah.
- Come here!
- No, no, no, stop!
Just paint your face
the shadows smile
Slipping me away from you
It doesn't matter how you hide
We find you
if we're wanting to
So slide back down
and close your eyes
Sleep a while
You must be tired
But every night I burn
Screaming the animal scream
Every night I burn
Dreaming the crow-black dream
Dreaming the crow-black dream
- Couple more rings. That's 24K.
- 24K, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- It's 18K. It's crap.
It's probably fake.
Leather purse. Leather.
Geez. Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?
A blood stain that's on here?
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.
Now, you, take it or leave it.
Right there for ya.
Decisions, decisions, yes.
You cheap ass, chrome dome... child molestin', saprophyte motherfucker.
- Close the gate when you go out!
- Oh, I closes up for you... real good, massa.
Fuck you.
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.
Lucky I don't stab your fat ass.
Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
Peculiar personalities
The stretch of true realities
They keep calling me
They keep calling me
Keep on calling me
They keep calling me
What the fuck you all painted up for, crackhead, huh?
Halloween ain't till maé¦»na.
Come on.
I'll cut you!
Fuck you, murderer!
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!
- Man, what the fuck you want, man?
- I want you to tell me a story.
A man and a woman in a loft a year ago.
- You're out of your motherfucking mind...
- Listen!
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them on Halloween.
Yeah, yeah, right, Halloween, yeah.
Some dude, some bitch, whatever, man.
Her name was Shelly.
You cut her.
You raped her.
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shanked her pink ass and she loved it!
Murderer? Murderer? Let me tell you about murder. It's fun!
It's easy.
You gonna learn all about it.
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.
We never miss.
Try harder. Try again!
Victims. Aren't we all?
Sometimes it rains
inside my head
When the words run dry
And the walls are breathing
Hands are...
- Look at this mess!
What's the world comin' to?
- Yeah, it's a mess.
No, they don't
have to take you
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.
No, they don't
have to take you away
- Get out of my way, you worms!
- No, they don't have to take you away
Give me some of that over there!
Why don't you ladies come by later? Check me out.
Hey, guess what.
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.
- Boom.
- Can you imagine that? It's tragic.
Gather your soldiers. You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.
You're thinking about the past.
Dad gave me this.
Fifth birthday.
He said childhood's over the moment you know you're gonna die.
Is she asleep?
I think we broke her.
I love her eyes.
Pretty.
No, they don't
have to take you away
Hey, kid, get the hell outta the road!
I don't hate them
But I know them
I don't want them
hangin' 'round
I won't roll my bones
Don't fuck with me.
I told you to stay out of here.
So I guess you're not gonna be home till a lot later, huh, Darla?
She's busy. Go play with your dolls or something, okay?
I don't have any dolls.
- Get some food, huh?
- Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.
"Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police."
Thirty, I go 40 dollars.
And 20 from 60...
Who the fuck is this now?
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!
Go sleep it off somewhere else, dusthead, unless you want to get mutilated.
Always got to dick off.
Goddamn creatures of the night, they never learn.
Hey! Hey!
"Suddenly I heard a tapping, as if someone... gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."
What are you talking about?
You heard me rapping, right?
You're trespassing, and you owe me a fuckin' new door!
- I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.
- Yeah?
- Gold.
- You're looking for a coroner, shit-for-brains.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit on me!
Shit on me.
Shit on me!
Mr Gideon.
You're not paying attention.
No! My hand!
I repeat, a gold engagement ring, yes?
It was pawned here a year ago by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.
He confided in me before he ran out of breath.
- Who's this sack of shit?
- That's Tin Tin, one of
T-Bird's little helpers.
I think you can rule out accidental death.
Don't any of your street demons have real grown-up names?
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't look like your usual gang crap.
Oh, come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.
I'm supposed to thank you for that, right?
Word to the wise:
Watch your fuckin' mouth.
What the hell do you call that?
I call it blood, Detective. I suppose you'll write it up as graffiti.
You can leave my crime scene now, okay?
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?
- Don't you know this game?
What game are you talking about?
Okay, the rings.
I'll tell you about the rings!
They're in that-that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!
Take... Take the fucking rings out! You can choke on them, you son of a bitch!
- Look, it goes up to the attic.
- Okay.
No, no.
No, no, no.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.
Shelly.
I love you.
- You have one chance to live.
- Look, man, take anything you want.
- Thank you.
- Take anything!
Now you're going to tell me where to find the rest of Tin Tin's little party pals.
The Pit. They all hang out at the Pit.
All of T-Birds's little potato-heads hang out there. And Funboy, he lives there upstairs, all right?
- Funboy.
- Oh, baby, oh.
- Shit!
- A whole jolly club...
- Stop! Stop! Please!
- With jolly pirate nicknames!
- Stop! Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still.
Each one of these is a life... a life you helped destroy.
Look, I'm begging you, all right?
Don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Your job will be to tell the rest of them that death is coming for them... tonight.
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.
You walk outta here, they're gonna erase your sorry ass.
You're nothing but street grease, ya hear that... street grease, you motherfucker!
- Is that gasoline I smell?
- No, man, no. No!
No! No!
It's on the house, kiddo, you know that.
One root beer.
I can't do anything.
Your mom, technically, she's off right now.
Yeah, way off.
Police! Don't move!
I said, "Don't move!"
I thought the police always said, "Freeze."
I am the police and I say don't move,
Snow White. You move, you're dead.
And I say
I'm dead and I move.
Not one more step.
I'm serious.
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun? You high?
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.
I want you to move over to the kurb there. Go on, real nice and easy. Come on. Move it!
Okay, we're gonna wait here for backup.
- It's gettin' too friggin' weird for me.
- Oh, it gets better.
Do you know someone named T-Bird?
He had a friend who shouldn't have played with knives. Like the coat?
You're the guy that murdered Tin Tin.
- Hey, check it out.
- He was already dead.
He died a year ago, the moment he touched her.
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.
Get away from there!
Cops! Come on!
Get outta here!
Leave it, leave it! Run!
Oh, great, great.
Guy shows up looking like a mime from hell and you lose him right out in the open.
Well, at least he didn't do that walking against the wind shit. I hate that.
- Little early for Devil's Night.
- What the hell is going on, man?
You are very restless.
Just wish I was a little hungry again, that's all.
- Be careful of what you ask for.
- Yeah, you may get it, I know.
There are energies aligning against you.
Seeing is believing, isn't it?
Mmm, yummy.
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down to the foundation.
Nobody cleared this little event with me.
I didn't have nothing to do with that.
Well, sure.
You must be awful disappointed.
I got trouble. One of my crew got himself perished.
- Yeah, and who might that be?
- Tin Tin.
Somebody stuck his blades in all his major organs in alphabetical order.
Gentlemen, by all means, I think we ought to have an introspective moment of silence for poor old Tin Tin.
You're working for me tomorrow night, right?
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good. That's very reassuring.
I still ain't heard the story on why Gideon's burned down.
Is that a natural catastrophe or act of God or something?
Call it my need to know.
Let go, you creep!
Nah.
You need to slow down, you dickhead!
- He couldn't have stopped.
- He was a buttface.
I could have made it.
- What are you supposed to be, a clown or something?
- Sometimes.
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?
Don't thank me. Are we fighting the good fight?
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.
Annie, look at that.
"We, the undersigned tenants of 1929 Caulderon Court Apartments..."
- What is this, a petition?
- A big "kick me" sign... for a very nice girl who found herself a cause and the cause got her killed.
She was fighting tenant eviction in that neighbourhood?
Miss Shelly Webster and her nice rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.
You know, the last time you went snooping around on a case is when you got put back on the beat.
- Yeah, I know.
Torres keeps reminding me.
- Oh, I bet he does.
You're going to wind up working a school crosswalk.
- I'm cool.
- You didn't get that file from me, okay? And don't tell me you owe me one.
Ah, I owe you one!
Yeah, right.
Damn.
Tomorrow night, we can... we can get high... and watch this whole fucking city burn from that window.
I am the park
I am glow
In the motherfuckin'dark
I am shocked
And I see
I don't want to believe
No more
- There's a big fuckin' bird over there.
- No more
Huh?
- No more
- It's a squab.
Come here, bird.
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.
Bird. B-B-Birdie.
Here, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie.
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie.
Birdie? Hey, birdie?
Here, Funboy.
What the fuck?
No, man! Don't do that! You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!
Look at him.
Don't sweat it.
It's time for you to take your bird and leave, freako.
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?
You need professional help.
Bingo!
He shoots. He scores.
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ?
Stop me if you heard this one.
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.
Ow.
He hands the innkeeper three nails and he asks...
Don't you ever fuckin' die?
"Can you put me up for the night?"
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Yes, it fuckin' hurts.
Oh, God.
Look what you've done to my sheets.
I've got a gun in my pocket.
You're happy to see me, aren't you?
Stay away!
Stay away from me!
Look.
Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children.
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.
Your daughter is out there on the streets waiting for you.
If I wanted ice, I would have asked for ice! Now fill it up!
Fill it up yourself, macho man.
I really need this.
All right.
- You burn yourself playing with matches?
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.
- This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?
Get my friend here a glass of blood.
- Hey, hey, hon!
- Hey, good night, Darla.
You stay put right there.
Get away, steamhead.
Shh.
Well, as you can see,
I'm here on the corner of 27th Street
and East Washington Place...
the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.
It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see
across the street from me...
was totally demolished by fire.
The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies, but cost
the lives of two fire fighters.
In fact, if it weren't
for the constant surveillance
by the local police precincts...
Freeze!
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.
Fuck.
- Good likeness.
- I saw your body, man.
You... You died. You got buried.
You still have your hat on.
I gotta sit down.
Holy shit.
Say... are you some kind of... of ghost?
Boo!
I don't know what I am. I need you to tell me what happened to us.
Well, you took a six-story swan dive out of a window.
She, ah, was beaten and raped.
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.
I mean, come on.
Read the file.
Shelly Webster held on for 30 hours in intensive care.
And her body finally just gave it up.
I saw it, man.
I-I couldn't do jack for her.
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!
Hey.
- You okay?
- I saw her.
I saw her through your eyes.
You stayed with her the whole time.
Yeah, well, you got to understand something, all right?
I was... I was hoping she'd come out of it, you know.
Uh, give me something
I could work with.
Yeah. Look, I...
Why didn't you do something about it?
You think any of those people in that building... even the ones who signed the petition... would talk after what happened to you?
I kept asking questions and... finally got busted for sticking my nose where it wasn't wanted.
This your wife?
Yeah, we, uh... Well, not any more.
We're getting a divorce.
It's funny.
Little things used to mean so much to Shelly.
I used to think they were kind of trivial.
Believe me, nothing is trivial.
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.
You gonna vanish into thin air again?
I thought I'd use your front door.
Look, man, um, I'm sorry as hell for what happened to you and your girlfriend.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!
I watched the bullet hole close by itself.
And then my business gets blown up real good.
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.
He winked at me before he jumped out a fourth-floor window like he had wings.
He winked at ya?
Musicians.
What else did you see?
So far I haven't heard shit about what you're going to do about all this crap!
I mean, what do I get? My livelihood, it got flushed away and went swirling.
- You ain't lost everything.
- Yeah?
And maybe you're not such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!
Fair enough. Catch.
- Jesus.
- Say hello to the last fellow who wouldn't cooperate with me.
What are you tellin' me, this...
You tellin' me this thing is real?
All the power in the world resides in the eyes, fella.
Sometimes they're more useful than the people who bear them.
You know, you're directly out of your fucking mind! You know that!
Yeah. Eyes see.
It's one of the most important things
I learned from my sister.
Sister? She's supposed to be your sister?
My father's daughter.
That's right.
What's the matter, you don't see the resemblance?
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.
And a lot of detail.
What do you say?
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.
He-He told me to tell T-Bird that death was on its way.
Whatever the fuck that means.
And... Draven.
He said his name was Eric Draven.
Want to relax that thing now?
And this bird man, he just happened to let you live, huh?
You sure you ain't making all of this up just to save your own ass?
I ain't makin' all this up.
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.
All right.
A boy and his bird.
Awful touching.
Yeah.
Oh, for fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.
- Thanks.
- Funboy said he saw a black bird too.
A big one.
Then he choked to death on his own blood.
I'll have the janitor, uh, come on up.
You again.
You lost or hungry?
Hi.
It can't rain all the time...
Can't rain all the time...
Can't rain all the time... Can't rain
all the time... Can't rain all the time...
I don't know how many times I gotta tell you. We're in this together.
We ain't and one part falls and it all falls.
- Do you know how long it took us to put this together?
- Yeah, a long time.
That piece of rat shit made Tin Tin into a fuckin' voodoo doll.
Tin Tin was a dick.
Tin Tin.
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up!
- No Funboy.
- Probably still bangin' away on Darla.
Smokes and road beers.
Be quick.
I'm on it.
What the fuck are you supposed to be, man?
I'm your passenger.
Drive.
What's all this happy horseshit?
Hey, T-Bird! T-Bird!
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
Stupid asshair!
You hit my car!
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.
- This is business, right?
- Faster.
You got that cream stuff?
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.
What in the crap...
Oh, look.
You're makin' us popular.
When they flash us like that, they ain't friends.
This is vehicle 38.
We got us a big ol'red hot rod.
Hey!
You got somethin' personal, amigo, we can work it out, right? Huh?
Damn! Dead end!
Look out!
Oh, man, get out of the way!
Holy shit!
Goddam foreign cars!
Shit! Fuckin'...
Oh, I hate this.
This ain't good.
T-Bird, I got you, man!
I'm coming!
Shit!
Remember? Yeah, I remember everything.
But I don't know...
What? What? Huh? What?
What are you talkin' about?
No, no, no, no, no.
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her. We needed to put some fear into that little lady.
She wasn't going along with our tenant relocation programme.
Then her idiot boyfriend shows up and turns a simple sweep-and-clear into a total cluster fuck.
Who gives a shit?
It's ancient history.
What? What do you want?
What is it? What?
Speak to me. Speak!
Did you send us these complaints?
Come here.
"Abashed the devil stood."
Does it get you sweaty?
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.
You can't be you.
We put you through the window.
There ain't no comin' back.
This is the really real world.
There ain't no comin' back.
We killed you dead.
There ain't no comin' back.
T-Bird...
There ain't no comin' back!
There ain't no comin' back!
T-Bird.
"Abashed the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is."
He felt how awful goodness is.
He felt...
T-Bird. T-Bird!
This is the 7:00 a.m. Edition
of Action News.
For over a decade,
the night before Halloween...
has had a darker and deadlier nickname
in the inner city... Devil's Night...
the name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.
Last year over 200
individual blazes were reported,
and 11 people lost their lives.
Tonight, on the eve
of what may become the biggest
and deadliest Devil's Night ever...
the mayor has firefighters from all
surrounding counties as well as...
Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.
Wait. You loved eggs.
Yeah, when I was five.
So what do you want now, black coffee and cigarettes?
So what did you take to become Mother of the Year?
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.
- Who?
- Oh, it was nuts.
You're acting weird. Did you win the lottery or something, Darla?
Oh, forget it. I never was too good at this mommy shit.
Over easy.
I like 'em over easy, Mom.
Hey, Albrecht.
This is the third hit in your hood in 24 hours.
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.
- We're gonna have to I.D. His teeth.
- His name is T-Bird.
Arson was his specialty. Looks like he zigged when he should have zagged.
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'-shit.
Come here.
You're holding out on me.
I got a goddam vigilante killer knockin' off scumbags left and right, and you're covering up for somebody.
Who's the cartoon character in the painted face?
Hey, you're the detective.
Why don't you tell me?
Okay. Gideon's blows all to hell, and you're having a chitchat with some weirdo... who winds up in T-Bird's car when it zigs instead of zags.
Then you steal one of my case files from homicide... and you're saying this is just a fuckin' automobile accident?
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good. You know, you gotta write that shit down.
All right, smart-ass. The captain's got a little love note waiting for you.
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your suspension.
Suspension? For what?
Misconduct.
Yeah, give me the lab.
- One for sorrow, two for joy...
- Come here.
And three for a girl and four for a boy.
- Dancing...
- Here I am.
Eric?
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.
Gabriel.
I thought you were dead.
You're not dead, are you?
I knew it was you.
Even with the make-up.
I remembered your song.
You said, "Can't rain all the time."
That is from your song, right?
Come on, Eric, I know you're here.
I miss you and Shelly.
Gets so lonely all by myself.
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.
Sarah, I do care.
That's him. That's him!
But he looked different.
He was all painted up white like some kind of dead whore.
I seen him. T-Bird, he sent me in for some road beers, right?
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.
And he flash-fried T-Bird to his fuckin' car!
Oh, T-Bird!
Here's to you, buddy.
Maybe we oughta just videotape this, play it back in slow motion.
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?
- Empty.
- Fire it... Grave? What grave?
- What about my fuckin' grave?
- Three out of four.
- Oh, man!
He's working his way back to this speed freak right here.
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.
That boy was out of control. T-Bird, he came in, he says, "Waste 'em both."
And now this ghost gonna kill my ass next!
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.
- This ghost gonna kill m...
- Hey.
It ain't no ghost.
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.
We might need him.
Ghost gonna kill my ass.
He like his plain or with onions?
Fine. Don't talk to me.
When someone's dead, they can't come back, can they?
That's what I thought.
Are you referring to anyone in particular?
You'll just think I'm nuts.
Yeah, well, then maybe they'll have to lock us both up.
You see him too?
I saw somebody.
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.
Eric didn't come back for me.
He can't be my friend any more because I'm... I'm alive.
You want a friend to walk you home?
I am the wicked
I am the wave of the future
Being crucified
You things, things
things of the flesh
Do it slow
Down avenues
"Cut me"
Lust my eyes
Licking lips encouraging
Mr Careworn
To gaze upon the screen
Bask on
After the flesh
Boys.
It seems our friend T-Bird won't be joining us this evening... on account of a slight case of death.
You wanna sit down?
Well, well, well.
Devil's Night is upon us again.
I thought we'd throw a little party, start a bunch of fires, make a little profit.
I like the pretty lights.
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm sayin'?
- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong.
Best reason to quit.
Only reason to quit.
A man has an idea.
The idea attracts others... like-minded.
The idea expands.
The idea becomes an institution.
What was the idea?
See, that's what's been bothering me, boys.
And I tell ya, when I used to think about the idea itself... it'd put a big old smile on my face.
You see, gentlemen, greed is for amateurs.
Disorder, chaos, anarchy... now, that's fun!
- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?
I started the first fires in this goddam city.
Before I knew it, every charlatan and shitheel was imitating me.
Do you know what they got now?
Devil's Night greeting cards.
Isn't that precious?
Yeah.
The idea has become the institution, boys. Time to move along.
You don't want us to do
"Light My Fire" time for the whole city?
No.
No, I want you to set a fire so goddam big, the gods'll notice us again.
- That's what I'm sayin'.
- Right.
I want all of you boys to be able to look me straight in the eye one more time and say...
"Are we havin' fun or what?"
- Hey, you! What's your name? Skank!
- Huh? What?
- You don't feel that?
- I feel like a little worm on a big fuckin' hook.
"I feel like a little worm on a big fuckin' hook."
Well, boy, your mama must be damn proud of you.
How the hell'd that thing get in here?
Gentlemen.
Let me go! Let me go! I gotta go!
So you're him, huh?
The avenger. The killer of killers.
Nice outfit.
Not sure about the face though.
I just want him.
Well, you can't have him.
- Well...
- Let me go.
I see you have made your decision.
- Now let's see you enforce it.
- Aw, this is already boring the shit out of me.
Kill him!
Ooh, that had to hurt.
Well, that's that.
That guy was crazy.
He's gone.
Oh, no!
Get him!
Right here! H-Here, help me!
Help me! He's tryin' to kill me!
Jesus Christ!
Hey!
You're all going to die.
Get the fuck outta here!
Guess it's not a good day to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?
I'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there. Skank's dead.
That's right.
- What in the crap...
- Don't move! Hold it!
That's all she wrote.
Move and we shoot!
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.
- Stop running immediately.
- Holy shit!
... spread your arms and legs...
Stop immediately.
Lie down, spread your arms and legs...
Come on! Move it!
My advice: Next time duck.
So many cops, you'd think they were giving away doughnuts.
Shit!
I knew you were going to do that.
Look at that out there. The whole city oughta be in flames by now.
The sky oughta be red.
So that, I take it, is the late, great Eric Draven.
He has power, but it is power you can take from him.
I like him already.
The crow is his link... between the land of the living and the realm of the dead.
So kill the crow and destroy the man.
I'm coming home, Shelly.
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery in the middle of the night. Right?
- The safest place in the world to be.
- That's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.
It's really late, Sarah.
You didn't say goodbye.
You're just gonna have to forgive me for that.
And you're never coming back.
I gave this to Shelly once.
I think she'd like you to have it.
This way you'll always remember her.
I'll never take it off.
I'd better go sneak back in the house.
Bye.
Shh. Shh.
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.
Come on. Come on.
What is that, some sort of souvenir there from your pal?
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say? Hmm?
Her eyes are so innocent.
Eric! Eric, help! Eric!
Quick impression for you.
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!
Give me the girl, and I'll let you walk out of here.
Well, well. Why don't you just give me a minute to think about that, huh?
Nah. Fuck it.
Aw, fuck.
Well, well, well, it does seem to me that our little life... has undergone a rather significant change in the past few minutes.
Now wouldn't you agree?
Well, for a ghost you bleed just fine.
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it.
Bye-bye, birdie.
Aw, shit.
Well, I just came by to pay my respects, and here you are gettin' all shot up again.
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?
Two more.
- I can handle it. Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan. You stay in front, and when they run out of ammo,
I'll arrest 'em.
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.
Oh, shit.
You're bleedin' all over the place.
I thought, you know, you were invincible.
I was. I'm not any more.
Well, I guess you really will need my help, won't you? Come on.
You take that.
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.
This is all the power you ever had.
Now it is mine.
Pity there is not more time... for us.
Help me!
Eric, I'm scared!
Let me go!
Let her go!
You can have me.
I won't fight you.
- All right.
- No!
Eric!
- Sarah?
- Look out!
Eric!
You know, my daddy used to say,
"Every man's got a devil... and you can't rest till you find him."
Whatever happened back there with you and your girlfriend,
I cleared that building.
Hell, nothin' in this town happens without my say-so.
So I'm sorry if I spoiled your wedding plans there, friend.
But if it's any consolation to you... you have put a smile on my face.
You got a lot of spirit, son.
I am gonna miss you.
I have something to give you.
I don't want it any more.
Thirty hours of pain.
All at once!
All for you.
Yeah.
Go help him.
Are you alive?
God, I need a cigarette.
- Everybody else dead?
- You helped me.
What you kept in here saved me.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
I've been meaning to come to church anyway.
Oh, yuck.
I'm quitting as of now, if I live.
Stay with him until help comes.
He'll be okay, right?
Eric?
He does that a lot.
Shelly.
- At least it stopped raining, huh?
- It can't rain all the time.
No, I don't believe it.
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
- Look, you go on home. I'm okay.
- Okay.
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.
- You missed it.
- Get him out of here.
Thanks.
If the people we love are stolen from us... the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them.
Buildings burn, people die... but real love is forever.
We walk the narrow path
Beneath the smoking skies
Sometimes barely
tell the difference
Between darkness and light
Do we have faith
In what we believe
The truest test
Is when we cannot
When we cannot see
I hear pounding feet in the
In the streets below and the
And the women cried and the
And the children know that there's
There's something wrong
It's hard to believe that love
Will prevail
Oh, it won't rain all the time
The sky won't fall forever
And though the night seems long
Your tears won't fall
Forever
Oh
When I'm lonely
I lie awake at night
And I wish you were here
I miss you
Can you tell me
Is there something more to believe in
Or is this all there is
And the pounding feet in the
In the streets below and a
And a window breaks and a
And a woman falls and there's
There's something wrong
It's
It's hard to believe that love
Will prevail
It won't rain all the time
The sky won't fall forever
And though the night seems long
Your tears won't fall
Your tears won't fall
Your tears won't fall
Forever
Last night I had a dream
You came into my room
You took me into your arms
Whispering and kissing me
And telling me to still believe
Within the emptiness
of the burning cities
Against which we save
our darkest selves
Until I felt safe
And warm
I fell asleep in your arms
And when I awoke
I cried again
For you were gone
Oh, can you hear me
It won't rain all the time
The sky won't fall forever
And though the night seems long
Your tears won't fall
Forever
It won't rain all the time
The sky won't fall forever
And though the night seems long
Your tears won't fall
Your tears won't fall
Your tears won't fall
Forever
Drivin'faster in my car
Falling farther from just what we are
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more
These conversations kill
Falling faster in my car
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today
No conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
to wait too long
To wait too long

[Man Narrating]
Careful, Otto.
Don't spill it.
Hold your horses.
Children, heed the warnings
of your parents.
Peril awaits the incautious wayfarer...
and strews grief
where laughter once played.
##[Woman Vocalizing]
Think twice.
I'm sure you can live without that.
Don't get wet.
Nature has built for us
a beautiful world.
Allow yourself to drink in
its wonder safely.
Paths must be climbed with
the sure-footedness of a mountain goat,
but beware your skill at climbing.
The skill assures nothing.
A heedless heart
can be lured to dangerous heights,
and a sudden ice film...
or a single wobbly stone
can pry you loose from the path...
[Screaming]
And serenade you with the whistling wing
of the death plummet.
[Screaming Continues]
Then there is always the avalanche...
when the snow relaxes its grip on the slope...
and is dragged downward
under its own crushing weight.
The slightest sound...
- [Sneezes]
- Or any false move by anyone...
can trigger these deadly landslides
and sweep all into oblivion.
Guard yourself and your neighbor
against making that fatal sound.
Be vigilant.
Do you have your binoculars? Use them.
Silence. Propriety.
While clutched to its mother's bosom,
a baby in Tolzbad once lost an eye...
when a carelessly unpinned brooch
pierced right through the baby's eyelid.
As if infected with this carelessness,
the same baby, by then a grown swan feeder,
lost his other eye
when he got too close to a clock.
Caution is not enough for the blind.
It wasrt long before the swan feeder, too,
heard the loud song of the wind.
You should never hold a baby's face near an open pin.
[Narrator]
Once, an avalanche,
started by a single bleat of a lamb,
uncovered all the graves in a cemetery.
The dead had been
so well preserved by the ice,
long dead youthful husbands
were revisited by their brides,
now withered and old,
and young parents by their old children.
Henceforth, before burial,
- all the dead had their hearts perforated
with the long nail of the coroner...
- [Hammering]
Just to be on the safe side.
And ever since,
to prevent a repetition of the tragedy,
all farm animals
have had their vocal chords severed.
Absolute silence is required of us.
Children, sit still.
The noise of your play must be muted
until you comprehend the risk you represent.
Keep a lid on it. Don't be rash.
I'll do it.
Don't stand so close to the walnut tree.
You'll catch a chill.
Don't put too much pepper on it.
After long research, I've discovered
the existence of mountain nodes...
rare and extremely hard to find places,
quirks of the mountain ranges,
where all sounds sent out
are perfectly canceled by their own echoes.
From here,
within these acoustic shadows,
no dangerous noises can escape
to unloose the crushing mass of snows.
Here cautious vent
can be given to stifled impulses.
We can sing, laugh and cavort.
But I must stress,
even though safety is assured
by the acoustic laws of the ranges, we must not believe ourselves safe.
For always there is the wild, uncontrolled sound of nature.

Yes, Johann?
Herr Trotta, I was thinking.
Perhaps you shouldn't say what you're thinking.
I can't help myself.
I'd like to ask you for Klara's hand... in marriage.
We've known each other since birth.
Well, what do you think, Sigleinde?
Should we say yes?
Poppa, what do I know about such things?
Johann, you have my consent.
Poppa!
[No Audible Dialogue]
Come, Sigleinde.
I do believe we're late.
[Sigleinde]
For what, again?
I thought I'd die.
Your eyes are so blue.
Johann, watch your tongue.
It's true.
You're as fresh and sound
as a rose.
Oh, Johann,
it's magic that binds me to you.
Ours is a magic that...
Curious feature of life in this valley:
When two people who are in love speak to each other, however softly, their voices carry for miles.
[Johann]
Forever.
Till tomorrow, Johann.
Don't lose your way.
Don't stay up too late, darling.
You need your sleep.
I'll never let you out of my sight.
Don't forget to wear your sweater at the crevasse.
Good night.
Onufrij has made lamb tonight.
Would you like to set the table?
Watch how we set the table at butler school, Mother.
You can time us if you'd like.
If we make any mistakes, feel free to cane us.
As Frau Teacher says, that's how you learn to be more careful next time.
Why such a good mood, Johann?
Only because
Klara and I are going to be married.
And when are you going to make your mother happy?
Sigleinde would marry you.
There shall be dancing.
Lower the sheepskins.

You're the one that looks ill.
Let me feel your forehead.
Sit down. Rest yourself.
Tea is almost ready.
Look, Johann.
This napkin fold is called the lotus.
Not on the table, Grigorss.
But diligence is a butler's ally.
That's what Frau Teacher says.

Hurry up, Johann.

Come on, Johann.
[Mother]
Don't talk to strangers.
[Locks Clicking]
Good morning, children.
[All]
Good morning, Frau Teacher.
Today I have to talk to you about something very sad.
You all know about the tragic accident that happened on the... on the Eiger north wall in Setsburg.
Some of you even saw the one who was rescued.
The other one no longer lives.
He will not come back to his parents.
He will no longer enjoy the beautiful things that life, which is so very, very precious, may have had in store for him.
Never... gamble... with... life.
You are butler students.
It is hoped you will be punctual, faithful, diligent, well mannered, polite, earnest, hardworking, zealous, always obedient while you are with us.
Your appearance is, uh, inoffensive,
and I trust your conduct
will be so too.
Polish... until you can see your own reflection.
Pluck those nose hairs, Fritz.
But I must insist you make an effort
to restrain all your movements.
Loud voices and clumsy feet
are not in fashion here and never shall be.
Master has an occluded bowel.
Alert Herr Doctor Schmidt at once.
Try to see if you might find it
in your power... to always... set foot upon the floor with the utmost care.
The Count is exceedingly... sensitive about this.
Wrong.
Clean yourself and try again.
Be quick, cautious, alert,
precise and silent.
I also recommend that your comportment... remain cold and serene.
Here are the bodies of those foolish climbers.
What is the lesson?
[Both]
Never gamble with life.
Kurt.
She needs a light for her cigar.
Correct.
Hanz!
Remove the serving dish.
Correct.
Sepp.
Slide in her chair?
Correct. Ferdl?
Her fork has fallen on the floor.
Correct. Grigorss.
Plump the seat cushion.
Correct. Johann?
Remove her nightgown.
Wrong. You are butler, good for naught... save bed making, sand strewing.
Steady, man.
Kurt.
You're thinking too much of your Klara.
Groom his mustache.
Correct. Hanz?
The napkin is folded improperly.
Frau Teacher is very strict.
Brother, where are you going?
Klara's coming here to meet you.
Tell her I'm ill.
Tell her whatever you like.
[Animals Hooting]
[Trotta] No, I don't.
[Klara]
Yes, I will.
Easy now.
Oh, Poppa.
Watch your step.
[Wind Howling]
[Birds Squawking]
[Squawking Continues]
[Wings Swoop]
[Panting]
This is from Johann.
Eggs break very easily.
You'd best give it to Sigleinde.
Where is Johann?
J... Johann is ill.
The passions grow on high mountains... and fling their red blossoms to the storm.
Perhaps the boy has mountain fever.
It begins innocently enough,
with dreams of mountains,
a peak round as a plump knee...
or a crest like a frosted bosom,
white as goats'milk.
Who can resist
the temptation to climb?
Into the folds one swoons.
The rocks will catch you
in a piercing embrace.
There is something terrible
about mountains.
When the wind passes over
anything else in nature...
long grass or flowers...
there is a brief agitation,
an anxious stirring,
and then the wind passes away
as if it had never been.
With mountains, it is different.
Look at the ripples,
wrinkles in the rock.
The fearful passage of the wind
is etched in the very stone, like a scream that never ends.
[Mother's Voice]
Johann. Johann.!
You better put your name
on your new toothbrush
before some accidents happen.
[Tapping Drinking Glass]
[Animals Chirping, Screeching]
Franz, this is your father.
I have come back.
Are you still alive?
Nod if you are real.
I hear you nod.
Death has sharpened my ears, but for some reason it has left me blind, just as in life.
I cannot see what death is like, but this is what I know.
Sounds of swans, wings beating ceaselessly above my head, night winds blowing against my cheeks.
Most of the time,
I remember nothing and have no thoughts.
Then a memory strays into my head, like a lost traveler, famished and pleading.
I dreamt I saw your footprints... in the wet part of the underworld.
Why your footprints, Franz?
You, who have never walked.
I heard your footprints speak to me
in your voice.
You, who have never spoken.
I followed you here in my dream.
Am I awake?
I know that I am in your room and that you see me.
Your brother's heart...
It is full of sores.
He dreams of his mother like a bridegroom.
He is confused.
His virginity has become a curse.
One can get lost in love.
When I remember anything,
I remember how much
I wanted your mother's kisses.
My desire still lives in this house, unsatisfied.
And your mother's desire, also unfulfilled...
Johann has breathed it in.
Warn him!
I'm counting on you to warn him.
Warn him.
Warn him.
[Echoes Softly]
Warn him.
[Animals Chirping, Screeching]
[Birds Chirping]
Look at that butterfly.
How innocent it is.
Let us strive for purity in everything, even after our wedding.
Purity sickens me.
You can be pure for both of us.
Johann!
Klara.
Suppose that the sounds of angels singing hymns to our virginal love... was in reality a choir from the deepest pit of hell.
What are you saying?
You frighten me.
Forgive my raving.
I have not been sleeping well.
We live at a very high altitude.
You need rest.
Keep your mind fixed on goodness, as it always has been, and all will be well.
Here.
Let me smooth your brow.
How our feelings play with us.

I learned today
I'm first in my class.
Count Knotkers always hires the best of the graduating butlers to enter his service.
Can you imagine me waiting tables and lighting fires in that castle?
Quite an honor.
Of course, thejob
would have gone toJohann,

I'm sorry to mention his name.
One can't live in the past.
I must put all that behind me.
[Bell Clanging Softly]
I'd like to share my income with your family.
I realize your father's experiments, however valuable, bring in very little money.
If you'd allow me to do this small thing...
Thank you, my friend.
That won't be necessary.
I've accepted a job in the mines.
I begin work this afternoon, as a matter of fact.
You in the mines?
Why not?
I'm as strong as any man in the village.
Being in darkness all day seems strangely comforting to me now.
Perhaps I could accompany you to work someday.
You just have.
Ah, there's Poppa!
Hello, Grigorss.
Klara,
I do wish you'd reconsider.
Don't be silly, Poppa.
Mining's just like chopping firewood.
Besides, in the mines you can sing without starting an avalanche.
Very well. The least I can do is escort you down on your first day.
Don't forget your helmet.

##[Chorus Vocalizing]
- What will you be doing today?
- Oh, your sister and I will take our usual walk in the village.
Perhaps I'll finish my painting of her.
You still haven't painted me, Father.
I'm still waiting for inspiration.
##[Continues]
Good-bye, Klara.
Take care now.
Good-bye, Poppa.
You forgot your gloves!
You forgot your gloves.!
You forgot your gloves.!
You forgot your gloves.!
[Metal Clanging]
##[Chorus Vocalizing]
You forgot your gloves.!
[Birds Cawing]
I'm Grigorss Bernoltz, the new butler.
I'm Herr Schmidt.
Wipe your feet before you come in.
I hope that's a clean shirt.
[Shoes Scuffing]
Does the Count wish to see me before I begin?
The Count must never be disturbed.
If you do not stay out of his way, you will have cause to regret it.
A word of caution.
Don't, under any circumstances, go into this room.
No, Herr Schmidt.
Only the nuns are allowed in here.
Do you understand?
Yes, Herr Schmidt.
I think so.
Only the nuns.
This is the white bedroom.
The Count's mother rests here.
Since her illness, nothing, absolutely nothing of hers has been touched by unconsecrated hands.
Are your bowel movements regular?
Yes, Herr Schmidt.
I'm glad to hear it.
[No Audio]
[Klara]
Poppa, I'm home... from the mines.
[Chuckling]
Oh, how funny you look.
Poppa said you'd come home dirty.
He laughed when I asked if you'd look like a chimney sweep from my fairy book.
Poppa laughed?
Look. I have something to show you.
Poppa bought me this today.
He didn't want the sun to burn my fair skin.
He spoils us so.
Doesrt he, Klara?
Come down to the river with me.
Right now?
I need your help to clean off this dust.
[Water Flowing]
Come in.
It's too cold.
Take off your dress
and come in.
I can't clean myself.
What if someone sees us?
It's dark.
We swam together hundreds of times as children.
Don't frustrate me.
Only for a minute.
Don't splash me.
I won't.
Start with my face.
Rub hard.
It's too deep here.
The rock is slippery.
You silly girl!
I can't swim.
I'm getting out.
Clean my face!
[Trotta]
Is that you, Klara?
Cover your eyes, Poppa.
I'm helping Klara scrub herself.
This is most imprudent.
Klara, what is the meaning of this?
There's so much grime, Poppa.
I needed help.
Come to the house when you've finished, and we will discuss the matter.
The Count has summoned you to his chamber.
What have you done?
Nothing.
You must have committed some grave offense.
The Count never sees anyone.
[Gong Sounds]
Let a little light in.
So, you disappoint me.
I'm very sorry, Count Knotkers.
Raise your head.
I can't see you.
You look like you've killed someone.
L... I feel so much shame at having displeased you.
It was such an honor to be chosen as one of your servants.
My poor mother is overjoyed... that I'm working here.
Am I to be dismissed?
Please calm yourself.
I was teasing you
about being disappointed.
You've done nothing wrong.
I wanted to ask you
about your mother.
My mother?
Yes. Uh, my mother is dead,
as you must know.
We were very close.
She was a great lady.
It was difficult for me to think of
anyone else while she was alive.
You must know
that feeling.
Yes, I do.
But now... she's passed away.
Is your mother still as beautiful as I remember?
It's a difficult question for a son to answer.
I knew her very well, in my rather devil-may-care youth.
Has she spoken of me to you?
Only as a man to be looked up to.
My brother and I were taught to include your name in our night prayers.
I'm pleased to hear it.
You know, I've been shut up
in this castle for too long now.
I long for some companionship.
The villagers dream of capturing a glimpse of you.
As they should.
Perhaps I will pay a visit
to your mother one day soon.
For old time's sake.
It would be a very great honor.
I hope she can bear up in your presence.
She does not handle excitement very well.
Yes, she is rather... delicate.
Well, convey my regards to her.
That's all. You may go now.
[Whispers]
8:00. Lights out.
Trouble once again, my faithful Franz!
You must act this time to save your mother from a terrible fate.
A former rival of mine will be entering my house.
Yes. It is my house, whether anybody remembers my place here or not.
This rival will speak words of love to your mother, and she will drink them in eagerly, helplessly, until she is mad for his touch, for his breath upon her neck.
I see his cloak draped over her nakedness... and her forgetting everything but tight, pinching fingers,
his greedy biting.
She will leave this house for good and go to him.
You will never have her forgiveness.
And you will be sealed up
in this attic forever.
So act now, Franz,
while there is still time.
Can I help you roll out the dough, Mother?
I'm making gooseberry pie.
My favorite.
And a brimming mug of cow warm milk to go with it.
Tell me about your day... at the castle.
I performed all my duties with grace and decorum.
Don't boast, Grigorss.
It will make you careless.
And stop eating those gooseberries.
What would you say if I told you
I had an audience with the Count?
I'd say it was impossible.
You're full of secrets, Mother.
He says he knows you.
You have spoken to him.
I was a little troubled by his way of talking about you.
How do you mean?
Oh, I don't know.
Familiar.
Almost flirtatious.
I realize he's the Count, but you are my mother, and with Father and Johann gone,
I am your protector as well.
What did he say about me?
You really loved Poppa, didn't you?
What a foolish question.
It's not like you to have doubts about me.
I never doubt you,
Mother, only...
What?
I'm afraid to ask you this.
Then perhaps you should think of it better.
Why do we keep Franz in the attic?
Why won't you let us mention him in your presence?
[Breathing Heavily]
I have a hair ball in my throat.
[Whimpers]
I'll swallow it.
[Bird Squawking]
Franz.
Father.
Mother.
[Woman Whispering]
[Knotkers]
I stumbled around inside myself
again and again.
[Man Continues, Indistinct]
Zenaida. Zenaida.
Let me say that name.
That beautiful name.
Zenaida.
Zenaida.
Zenaida.
My mother disapproved
of our being together.
I couldn't go against her wishes.
But now that she's at rest,
I'm free... free to do what I like.
- Do I speak too boldly?
- Oh, let me be bolder still.
The night of my sors tragic accident,
I dreamt that you came into my room... and kissed me once sweetly on my breast.
Your face was still of that handsome young man I longed for.
Oh, how many years, in spite of all my troubles... and heartache.
I cherished that dream, dearest Count, as a sign from heaven
God has not forsaken me.
Why did you marry that wretched swan feeder?
I cringe at the thought of him sleeping beside you.
If you only knew what I endured with him.
My first child,
Franz...
he smelled like my husband,
even as an infant.
I couldn't nurse him.
I couldn't nurse him
without thinking for a moment
how much I hated my life.
He never spoke.
He fell ill and had to be confined to his sickroom.
I gave him to my husband.
"Feed him with your swans,"
I told him.
[Whimpers]
But my other sons,
Johann and Grigorss...
they are yours.
At least in spirit.
When I conceived them, my thoughts were only of you.
I cried out to you, silently,
while my husband
blindly and clumsily labored.
Oh, my darling.
Let me give Grigorss a title then.
And let us wed as soon as possible.
We've wasted half of our lives.
[Jingling Softly]
Where are you
leading me, Daughter?
You'll see, Poppa.
Put your foot just there.
Here?
Just there.
Is Sigleinde still behind me?
Yes, Poppa.
I told her to be as quiet as a snowflake.
Take off your blindfold.
Take off my blindfold.
My Lord.
Look at this.
What is this place?
It's my mountain hideaway, Poppa.
For weeks I've been bringing things here.
I want to make a little home for the two of us... a home away from home, where we can visit and be close and tell each other stories.
You could eat horsehair at this little table.
Where's Sigleinde?
I want a special place, just for the two of us.
Please, Poppa.
Grant me this one request.
I can't think about this right now.
What have you done with your sister?
She's walking in the forest.
Here. Let me show you my treasure chest and the quilt I made for you.
No. She's lost.
I must find her.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Imagine. Only two weeks ago your were lighting fires in the basement... and washing goblets in the kitchen.
Now you're wearing the uniform of a high official.
Don't rub your eyes, or this may all disappear.
How I wish it were that simple to end a nightmare.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Clinks]
Very recently,
Grigorss Bernoltz... joined the ranks of my servants.
He dreamed, like most servants dream,
of a long career
of faithfully discharged duties.
Tonight Grigorss removes his butler's livery... and takes seat at my right hand.
From now on, he shall be called...
Coronet Counselor
Grigorss von Knotkers.
I will bestow on him all the privileges of a firstborn son,
and I expect all of you
to regard him as my son...
and treat him with the same degree
of respect and deference...
that you owe to me.
His mother, Zenaida,
has agreed to be my wife.
This dinner has been arranged...
to make a public announcement
of our engagement.
If we seem overly hasty to complete the nuptials, well, so be it.
When is it more fitting for a man and a woman... to be impetuous than when they are in love?
Grigorss, please join my side.
Your mother and I would like your blessing on our union.
I'm sure you won't withhold it.
Do I have permission to speak?
[Knotkers] My dear son,
you no longer need permission.
Very well.
Since I've been granted a title,
I'm within my rights to challenge you to a duel, tomorrow on Mitterwald's Tongue above the clouds.
Are you mad?
Perhaps this will make your decision easier.
This is for shaming the memory of my father... and attempting to lead my too easily tempted mother from the path of virtue.
Get your coat, Mother.
Our business here is complete.
Grigorss, don't turn around.
I can't bear to look at you.
In the morning, I'll be dead.
Then you won't have to.
Let me tell you what you've done tonight.
You've plunged a dagger into your mother's heart.
You've ripped my skin off and poured hot lead into my veins.
I'm sorry for any... inconvenience
I may have caused you.
Why have you laid this curse on me?
Why?
Because you made my poor blind father a cuckold.
Because I wanted to see your seducer's smile die on his face.
Lower your voice.
We'll set off an avalanche.
What do I care?
[Rumbling]
Did you see him, Mother?
White with rage.
If I'd flung a dozen more words in his face, he'd have died on the spot.
Listen to me. Listen.
I'm still your mother.
You're my only child.
If you should die,
I will have no reason to live.
There's still some time to stop this madness.
Come home with me.
[Sigleinde]
Poor Gerda, mountain wild girl.
To be chained so for our safety.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Bell Clangs]
[Trotta's Voice]
This is most imprudent.
Klara, what is the meaning of this?

What have you done with your sister?
Well, what do you think, Sigleinde?
Klara, what is the meaning of this?
Come, Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
Sigleinde.
[Rumbling]
Where's Sigleinde?
You'd best give it to Sigleinde.
[Rumbling]
Sigleinde. Sigleinde.
Johann.
Poppa.
Grigorss.
Grigorss.
[Bird Chirping]
[Chains Clink]
Lower the sheepskins.
We'll have music.
Remember... when Johann and you and I... danced together the last time?
How happy we were then.
Yes, we were children of light.
Or so it seemed.
Now the night's come to drown us.
Dance with me.
Hold me.
If I cannot believe in you, all the women of the world are painted like the harlot.
Shh!
It's all a bad dream.
You can beg the Count's forgiveness in front of his servants.
He will spare your life out of love for me.
Perhaps I can go away to a distant land.
Wherever you go, I'll find you.
Mother always knows where her son is hiding.
Does it mean so much to you that I live?
Is it not the Count whose life you fear for?
Precious child.
Look into my eyes.
What do you see?
Gentleness.
Pity.
What can I do to win your faith back?
I'll do anything.
There is one thing you can do.
If you agree,
I will kiss the Count's feet, plead for mercy... and give my blessings to your marriage.
Name it. I'll do it.
Accept Franz as your son.
Go to him. Embrace him.
Franz loves you.
When I leave, there will be no one left to take care of him.
You are right.
There must be peace in this home again.
I have done a great wrong.
It is God's will.
I believe you, Mother.
Forgive me.
Franz. Wake up.
You have a visitor.
My son.
My eldest child.
Is there still room in your heart for me?
Oh.
[Sobbing]
Now I've told you everything.
Franz can begin living.
A great weight has been lifted from me.
I feel revived.
You wear false comforts,
Grigorss.
What about your father?
Have you forgotten him?
Of course not.
Think of what the Count has done to him.
His honor must be vindicated.
But I made a promise to my mother.
You had no right to.
I could not love a man... who placed anything above his father's honor.
Not even his love for me.
Do you think you could love me?
I had no hope of you ever loving me.
I... could love someone who has done his duty.
I've been blind.
Thank God I did not go down on my knees to that monster.
I shall go to the castle at once and arrange the duel.
Knives at dawn.
Here is the hair I have lost in the past three months.
Take it. It belongs to you.
You will know why one day.
If you come out of it alive,
I will be here waiting for you.
And if you don't, you will be waiting, somewhere, for me.
Farewell.
[Chains Clink]
Have you no seconds?
No one in the community would stand against the Count.
Then use Herr Schrammel here.
He'll be sacked otherwise for dropping a teacup.

What happened?
Did you get caught in a mountain storm?
Mother.
[Liquid Burbling]
Are you conscious?
Do you recognize me?
Where am I?
Safe at home.
I'm rubbing your chest with the goose grease, just as I did when you were a little boy.
Do you remember how often
I promised you that when I grew up...
I would sail out in a big ship and bring you back all the treasures in the world?
Do I remember?
You were to bring me hyacinths because I loved them so much.
And a palm.
Mother, I've done a terrible thing.
No. Last night is past and forgotten.
The Count will forgive you.
You'll see.
I have an influence over him still.
I killed Count Knotkers...
early this morning in a duel.
What?
What are you saying?
You're delirious.
There seemed no other way.
Your name was forming on his lips when he died.
Two more seconds,
and he would have spoken it.
Here. Put this on.
Quickly.
What am I to do?
Get out from this house and never come back.
You have killed my love for you.
Go. Do you hear me?
There is no goodness left in the world.
Franz, I want you to watch over me.
Look at your mother.
I'm rather clumsy.
Only you could help me.
Am I doing this right?
Yes, I think so.
There.
[Wood Clatters]
Klara.
Klara.
Grigorss, you've come at last.
Well?
He is dead.
I am an outcast.
All is not lost.
Come with me.
I have something to show you.
Oh, Klara, you're a wild one.
So are the reindeer when summer is coming.
You must take the gondola across.
There's very little oxygen.
You may find yourself
gasping for breath.
You are not softhearted, are you, Grigorss?
[Laughs]
[Yawns]
No.
I assure you that I'm not.
I have a dreadful secret to share with you.
[Yawns]
About my father.
I'm afraid that in my present state
nothing could seem dreadful.
Could you marry me, Grigorss, even if I were not... chaste?
Chaste?
My God, did Johann dishonor you... before his accident?
No. His thoughts were pure.
He used to call me his golden fleece.
Who then?
My father.
[Yawns]
He ravished me in the woods.
[Yawns]
I refuse to believe it.
Look at this, Grigorss.
My mountain hideaway.
The two of us can be outcasts here together.
We need never see anyone but each other.
We can live on berries and grasses... and small animals we can kill with sharp sticks.
You can sleep in my arms when the mountains blacken.
What about your father?
That won'thy, blameless man.
Are you saying he... he took advantage of you?
Shall I show you the leaves drenched in my blood?
That was not the wedding night
I had imagined.
You must never speak of this.
God has left this mountain to the devil.
We have all joined his unoly dance.
This place can be ours,
Grigorss.
Here we can have our own laws.
Here's my treasure chest.
Shells from the seashore.
A wooden flute.
Quilts that my mother made.
One dire thought occurs to me, but it would freeze my blood to utter it.
Speak.
You could kill my father.
Oh, Klara.
Or better yet,
I could throw myself off a precipice.
Then perhaps Father would repent of his crime and life could go on as usual.
Why should the victim suffer?
We shall have no more talk of suicide.
Do you think your father is capable of repentance?
The hardness of his gaze makes me doubt it.
He asked me to come to his room tonight.
He told me... there would be no more pain.
Monstrous!
He must be killed.
A few hours ago,
I rid this mountain of another villain.
I can still smell his blood on my hands.
Soon I can wash these filthy hands in the blood of your father.
There needrt be any blood.
Suppose we rode with him in a sleigh through Uhlars Pass.
We could tell him it was an errand of mercy.
He will not refuse, because he's a Christian.
You will be driver.
When we get close to the place
where the mountain is nearest
the edge, you can stand...
and fire your pistol.
[Rumbling]
That will start an avalanche.
Father will be startled.
We will both leap to safety.
Father and the sleigh will fall thousands of feet, and his evil will be blotted out.
Let God decide what a just punishment shall be.
Such terrible calm.
I feel like a trembling schoolboy next to you.
Shall we do it?
I hear the angel's trumpet.
It is ordained.
[Footsteps Approaching]

My name is Mary Lennox.
I was born in India.
It was hot...and strange...
...and lonely in India.
I didn't like it.
Nobody but my servant...
...my ayah, looked after me.
My parents didn't want me.
My mother cared only to go to parties...
...and my fa ther was busy with his military duties.
I was never allowed to go to the parties.
I watched them from my mother's bedroom window.
I was angry, but I never cried.
I didn't know how to cry.
-I left my fan. You didn't have to come.
-I wanted to.
My parents always thought about themselves.
They never thought about me.
If only I could've known...
...that in a few moments
I would lose them forever.
Earthquake!
The families of the Indian earthquake orphans should please go to Dock 2.
We're here, Mary! Can you believe it?
She's so sour. I heard that she never cried when her parents died.
'"Mistress Mary, quite contrary....'"
Numbers 38 and 39...
...George and Amy Brent.
Numbers 40 and 41...
...Timothy and Thomas Burke.
-Here we are!
-Here we are!
Oh, my boys, my boys.
Number 43, Mary Lennox.
'"Mary, Mary, quite contrary
'"How does your garden grow?
'"With silver bells
'"And cockleshells
'"And pretty maids all in a row.'"
Number 43...
...Mary Lennox.
Please, just step aside.
Number 44...
...Adam Snow.
Mary Lennox?
Is that Mary Lennox?
Number 43.
Yes, Mary Lennox.
I've come to claim her.
I'm Mrs. Medlock, housekeeper of Misslethwaite Manor...
...for the Lord Archibald Craven...
...her uncle and guardian.
What a queer, unresponsive little thing.
And, my word, a plain piece of quince.
Her mother was a beauty.
She certainly didn't hand much of it down.
She might improve as she gets older.
Children change.
She'll have to change quite a bit.
There's not much to improve her at Misslethwaite Manor.
Come along.
It's a pity for you that you haven't any other place to go.
Your uncle won't trouble himself about you.
That's for sure.
He never troubles himself about anyone.
As if having a crooked back...
...wasn't cross enough for a man to bear, but she had to up and die on him.
Your aunt is dead.
Didn't your mother tell you?
Strange.
Not telling you that her own twin sister was dead.
My mother didn't have the time to tell me stories.
Oh, at last.
There's Misslethwaite.
You'll go straight to bed for a few hours.
You probably haven't gotten much rest.
There's your breakfast.
I'm still in my nightgown.
You can change after you eat.
There are new clothes in the wardrobe.
Who'll dress me?
You can't dress yourself?
Of course not. My ayah dressed me.
Nonsense.
As old as you are?
What do they do with children in India?
Carry you around in a basket?
How dare you talk to me with such disrespect!
Nobody's going to carry you around Misslethwaite Manor.
We've far too much work already.
So you'll have to look after yourself.
There are 100 rooms here.
This one and no other is yours.
Don't expect to see your uncle because it's certain you won't.
You are not to touch anything, or to go wandering and poking about.
The house seemed dead...
...like a spell had been cast upon it.
It lookedjust like my mother's room.
This must have been my aunt's.
The dressing tables were the same.
They even had twin ivory elephants.
Mother.
What are you doing? What did I tell you?
I heard someone crying.
Dogs.
No, someone! A person crying.
You heard nothing of the sort.
Now...
...you stay where you are told, or I'll come and box your ears.
Good afternoon.
I brought you something to eat.
You haven't touched your porridge.
Didn't you want it?
Are you my servant?
I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant.
She's Lord Craven's.
But I'll be doing the housemaid's work up here and waiting on you a bit.
Waiting on me makes you my servant then.
You are strange.
Hey, I know that.
Mrs. Medlock gave me the place out of kindness to me mother.
She said she could never have done it if there was a grand missus here.
I'd never be let out of the kitchens...
...and certainly not upstairs.
Stop it!
What're you doing?
I thought all girls liked to be tickled.
What would you like to wear?
Black...
...black or black?
Are you blind?
They're all black.
And I won't be laughed at, servant.
My name's Martha.
I won't tickle you. I promise.
What do they wear in India?
When I heard you were coming,
I thought you'd be a native.
What?
You thought I was a what? You....
You....
You daughter of a pig!
You needn't be like that.
I've nothing against natives.
My mother says all of us are family.
I've never seen a native.
I was pleased to think I was.
You don't know anything about anything!
None of you know nothing!
Please.
Don't be vexed.
I don't know anything about anything...
...like you said.
I'm sorry, miss.
I'm too common and I talk too much.
I beg your pardon, miss.
I don't know when exactly your uncle will call for you.
My uncle?
Mrs. Medlock said he wouldn't want to see me.
But he does.
Your uncle's decided not to see you today.
When will I see him?
Tomorrow?
No. He'll be gone tomorrow.
After the mistress died ten years ago...
...Lord Craven wouldn't see people.
There's nobody to ease his sorrow.
He spends most of his time away from home now.
Poor man.
They say he's cursed.
Better put your sweater on.
It's cold outside.
But I've got no one to play with.
No one to play with?
Let me out of here.
Dickon, my brother...
...goes up on the moor by himself for hours.
That's how he made friends with all his animals.
Who?
Dickon...
...me younger brother.
Pull it down!
You have no idea how curious he is about you.
What do you think you're doing?
There you are!
I wondered where you'd gone.
What do you mean?
You knew perfectly well where I was.
Your scarf, miss.
There.
Thou is ready to go out now.
I can't see.
To get to the gardens...
...you must go through there...
...then around the outside of the house.
Run along now. Have fun.
What's beyond there?
Another garden?
Where's the door?
You there!
-Where's the door to that other garden?
-What?
The one with all the ivy.
I didn't see a door.
There isn't one.
There has to be a door somewhere.
No one's been inside that place for ten years.
Why?
Why?
Because when she died, the master gave orders to shut it up forever.
Who died?
My aunt died.
It was her garden, wasn't it?
Look at me.
Answer me, you!
It's revolting how these people behave toward me.
Of course...
...orders couldn't keep him out.
He's the only one goes in there nowadays.
If you know the way...
...show me.
Who's there?
He hates it.
Why does Lord Craven hate her garden?
-We're not supposed to talk about it.
-Why not?
I've got a present for you.
Mother sent it over to you.
What's it for?
You mean, all they've got is elephants and tigers in India?
They've not got skipping ropes?
Come here.
Watch.
Now, you try.
Thank you, Martha. Thank your mother.
You are strange.
If you'd been any other child...
-...you'd have given me a kiss.
-Do you want me to kiss you?
What's that?
Go on now, Miss Mary.
Go, go.
I've never skipped before.
Well, he's impressed.
Cheeky little beggar. Look at him.
What about him?
I can't think why, but...
...he's decided to make friends with thee.
He has?
I've never had any friends.
That I believe.
Show me.
Please show me the way in.
Thank you, robin.
I need more.... Martha!
I need more plasters! More towels!
Did you see what I found, pretty robin?
You're getting on well enough with that this morning.
Tastes nice today.
Listen.
Hear that?
It's the wind.
Sometimes it sounds like someone's lost out in the moor...
...and crying.
Poor little Betty Butterworth...
...the scullery maid.
She's had a toothache all morning.
I need your help. Come on.
Get this child outside at once!
Come on, Martha, please!
Soot.
He doesn't know thee. You frightened him.
I frightened him?
Come.
He won't hurt you.
-He'll bite me.
-He won't.
But he's filthy and dirty.
No, he's soft. You'll like it.
There. I did it.
Like that, Miss Mary.
I know you, too.
You're Martha's brother, Dickon.
The robin says he's been waiting for you.
The animals tell me all their secrets.
He wouldn't tell you my secret.
About what, Miss Mary?
A garden.
I've stolen a garden.
Maybe it's dead, anyhow.
-I don't know.
-I'd know.
Promise you won't tell?
Promise.
Nobody?
Not a soul.
It's a secret garden.
Secrets are safe with me.
-And you'll know if it's alive?
-'Course.
Wait here.
This garden's not dead.
It's as alive as you or me.
See? This part's wick.
See the green?
Wick?
What's wick?
Alive.
Full of life.
There'll be so many roses in there this summer...
...you'll be sick of them.
Look!
There's a picture of my mother and my aunt sitting here.
They say that's how she died.
How?
From falling off it.
For the first time since coming from India...
...I dreamed about my mother.
She was here...
...in the garden...
...and the garden was ajungle.
Come to me.
Are you a ghost?
Are you?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Who are you?
I'm master of this house, while my father's away.
Your father?
He's my uncle.
Nobody told me he had a son.
Come here.
What's your name?
I'm Mary Lennox.
What's your name?
I'm Colin Craven.
Our mother's were sisters. Twins.
Twins?
Nobody told me she had a twin.
-Why were you crying?
-I can't sleep.
Plump my pillows for me, Cousin Mary.
-What?
-My pillows.
My covers got twisted.
I don't know what to do about it.
-I'll get Martha, or Mrs. Medlock.
-No!
Why not?
Medlock wouldn't allow you in here.
She'd be afraid you'd upset me...
...and make me more ill.
-Do I? I'll go.
-Stop!
Stay here!
How old are you?
Ten.
We're the same age.
What's your mother like?
She's dead.
Mine's dead, too.
Do you see that cord?
Pull it.
That's my mother.
My father never wants to see me because...
...I don't look anything like her.
But you, you look like her.
Why do you keep a curtain over her?
She smiles too much.
Smiles too much?
How can anybody smile too much?
Sometimes I hate her.
-She died when I was born.
-I thought she died in her garden.
Garden?
What garden?
Oh, just a garden.
There are so many of them here.
-Are there?
-Of course.
Don't you go outside?
Never.
What's wrong with you?
I'm going to die.
From what?
Everything.
I've spent my whole life in this bed.
You don't know how to walk?
You are real?
My dreams are so real sometimes.
Shall I pinch you to prove it?
See?
How did you know to pull the weeds?
It looked like it was strangling.
I don't even know what it is.
A lily. It's an Empress-of-India lily.
Empress of India?
These bulbs are lilies, too.
We'll plant them all around your lily.
She'll have her own ladies in waiting.
It's just like the rhyme:
'"Mistress Mary, quite contrary
'"How does your garden grow?
'"With silver bells and cockleshells
'"And pretty maids all in a row.'"
On the boat coming here, they used to sing that song at me.
I wasn't as contrary as they were.
I met my cousin last night.
You've seen Colin?
Did you know about him?
Everybody knows about him.
But hardly anybody's seen him.
He said his mother died when he was born.
She fell off the swing.
He was born too soon.
He's not at all like you.
His cheeks are whiter than ice and marble.
Whiter than these little hairs.
Those are the roots.
Set it in there.
Let it grow this way, Miss Mary.
How tiresome to be shut indoors.
It's too stuffy!
I'll faint if I don't get some light and fresh air.
At least we can open the windows.
No, get away from there!
Don't touch them.
They're nailed shut.
My lungs can't take the spores.
Spores?
The wind carries them. When you breathe the air, you swallow them.
They get stuck in your lungs.
Before I got out into the wind, even my hair was scrawny.
Your hair?
-Hair is dead.
-If hair is dead...
...then how come it keeps growing even after you die?
Well, maybe not your hair!
By then you might be bald.
Don't be stupid.
I'll be dead before I'm old enough to be bald.
I'll get a lump on my back like my father.
Then I'll die.
I hate how you talk about dying.
Everyone thinks I'll die.
If everyone thought that about me,
I wouldn't do it.
Here.
Put this on.
Everyone has to wear one.
Medlock's orders.
-But she's not here to see me.
-Put it on.
It makes my face itch.
I can't stand it!
I didn't give you any germs last night!
Put on the mask.
Stop talking to me as if you were a rajah with jewels stuck all over you.
I'll talk to you any way I please.
Where are you going?
Back outside to be with Dickon.
He tames animals like the animal charmers in India.
He knows everything about gardens.
Does he know about my mother's garden?
-What?
-You said my mother had a garden.
How would he know about it?
It's locked. No one's allowed in there.
-I'll make them unlock it.
-No, don't do that.
Why not?
If you make them open the door like that, if everyone knows...
...it wouldn't be a secret anymore.
Don't you see how much better it is if it's a secret?
You have to.
Maybe you can't even keep a secret.
Master Colin, we've brought the machine for your legs.
I don't want it.
Now, don't be like that.
You know how important it is for your circulation.
I've got some nice, fresh flannels, too.
Your father returns today.
He won't want to see me.
Perhaps he will.
The machine. Wake up, girl!
Oh, I forgot my herbs.
-I'll get them for you.
-No, thank you.
Last time, you brought too many roots and almost no leaves.
What are you doing down there,
Miss Mary?
Where's your mask?
If Mrs. Medlock finds out....
The world's coming to an end.
She won't let you come back.
But you're master until your father gets home, you could make her--
Go! Just go!
She'll think I disobeyed her.
She'll fire me for sure.
Please! Go!
His Lordship's arrived! He's here!
Come along, Miss Mary.
Come along.
Miss Mary, Your Lordship.
Calm down.
Come here.
You needn't be afraid.
Come here.
My God!
Your eyes!
They're so much....
I had no idea.
Wait a moment.
They never sent me your picture.
Mother had no time to get my picture taken.
Medlock wants me to send you to some sort of boarding school.
Please. Let me stay.
I don't do any harm.
Harm?
What harm could you do?
There's nothing for a child here.
I don't need much.
All I need is....
Could I...?
Could I have a bit of earth?
Bit of earth?
To plant seeds in.
To make things grow.
Take your bit of earth.
Don't be foolish and expect anything to come of it.
May I take it from anywhere so long as it's not wanted?
Anywhere!
Well.... Go! Go!
You can go.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
I'll be away until the winter.
He said I can!
I can have my bit of earth!
Who said?
My uncle. I asked him and he said '"yes.'"
I can plant seeds anywhere I like.
Blue flowers, pink flowers...
...purple flowers, yellow flowers...
...cornflowers, foxgloves, any kind we want.
It's raining.
The rain will help our flowers grow.
In India when it rained, my ayah would tell me stories.
In one of the stories there was a god who reminds me of you.
When he was growing up...
...he had to be kept a secret, so no one would see him.
Really?
-Why?
-Because his uncle wanted to kill him.
His uncle dreamed the young god would take over heaven.
-Where did he hide?
-He lived with some cows.
Was he different from other people?
Only on the inside.
When you looked down his throat you could see the universe.
The universe couldn't fit down anybody's throat.
Down his it could.
How?
He'd have to be bigger than the whole universe to fit it down his throat.
You said he looked like everybody else on the outside.
That's right. It's inside that he was different.
-It doesn't make sense.
-It doesn't have to make sense.
It's the idea of it.
It's so stupid.
-No, it's not. It's magic.
-You can't be that stupid.
I am not stupid!
You don't understand. You don't want to!
You can't leave!
You wouldn't dare!
Wouldn't I?
-I'll have them drag you back in.
-Will you, Mr. Rajah?
Fine.
That's just fine.
Then I won't even look at you.
I'll stare at the floor.
I'll clench my teeth together and never tell you one thing.
Not even about seeing your father.
Yes, you will.
Tell me.
He didn't come to see me.
I'll die 'cause he doesn't like me.
He likes me.
But he's my father!
Maybe if you weren't so rude.
I'm not rude!
Yes, you are! You're so sour!
You won't even open your windows and let the sunshine in.
How can I? It's raining out.
-Even if it weren't raining.
-If it weren't raining, maybe I would.
-You never have.
-Does that mean I never would?
I'm not sour.
Will he ever see Colin?
-He's afraid to fall in love with him.
-He's afraid to love his son?
Sometimes when he's here, he stays alone for a week.
But Colin wants to see him.
Sometimes, he stays longer.
Longer than a week?
Ten years ago...
...when his wife died, he locked himself in for over a month.
Colin was such a weak baby, everyone thought he'd die.
His father couldn't bear losing him, too.
He'd suffered so much already.
My poor little boy.
That was the night the rain stopped, the night spring came to Misslethwaite.
My poor uncle fled from it...
...as if he were escaping the spring.
Medlock's gone!
It's working. It's working any minute now.
Hold, Dickon!
Hold! It's working!
Come down! We need a hand.
It's beautiful, Colin. Do you feel it?
Do you?
I'm coming!
What about the spores?
Can you see them?
Jesus.
Come help me, please.
Put him on the bed.
Calm yourself, Master Colin.
Please, just calm down!
Calm down. See if Mrs. Medlock's back.
Calm down!
Calm down, please!
Miss Mary, please, don't go in there now.
He's having a dreadful fit.
Lord knows what he'll do.
I don't care. He's so spoiled, he must be stopped.
Somebody's got to make him stop.
Stop it, you! Stop! I hate you!
Everybody hates you!
You're so selfish! You're the most selfish boy there ever was!
I'm not as selfish as you are.
Because I'm always ill.
Nobody ill can scream like that.
I'm going to die!
What do you know about dying?
-My mother died!
-Both my parents died!
I'll get a lump on my back.
I'll get a lump like my father's!
It's Master Colin! It's Master Colin!
Come quickly, John. Come quickly.
There's nothing but your bones sticking out.
It's because you're so skinny.
What in God's name?
Get away from him, beastly girl!
You'll kill him!
-I won't hurt him!
-She's my cousin!
Give me a hand.
Hold his arms up.
Martha, stop that girl!
He doesn't have a lump!
-You let that wretched girl in here?
-No, ma'am.
You disobeyed me!
You are done for.
You can hie yourself home.
But I didn't tell her.
What's going on?
I'll send you away if you dare think of making her go!
Now, get out of here!
I want to be alone with my cousin.
Beg your pardon?
I'm ordering you to leave this room!
Ordering me?
Go!
I shall.
If only to prevent you from harming yourself with this hysterical shrieking.
But, I promise you....
Maybe I'm not ill.
I don't see how.
You're just weak.
Do you think I could go outside?
Spores and all?
I don't know anything about spores.
If I went out...
...maybe we could find the door to my mother's garden.
If we found the door...
...we could go inside.
What is it?
I didn't dare tell you.
I didn't because I was so afraid
I couldn't trust you.
What?
I've been in the secret garden.
I found the key weeks ago.
Go on. Tell me.
When you open the door, you can't see anything.
Then you go down some stone steps.
By the time you reach the bottom, you're surrounded by flowers.
Every day, new flowers open.
It's like magic.
Baby animals are being born.
I'm going out in my chair.
If the fresh air agrees with me...
...I may go out every day.
Not every day, surely, Master Colin.
When I go, nobody is to be anywhere near.
None of the staff, not a single gardener.
Is that clear?
What do they say in India...
...when you want people to go?
You say:
'"I have spoken. All depart.'"
I have spoken.
All depart.
But remember...
...this is very important.
Step back.
You are to stay here, Medlock.
-Oh, but Master Colin--
-Stay here!
Just take these stupid things off!
What good are they now?
Get inside.
-Are these your animals?
-Yes.
It's safe.
Go fast, Dickon! Faster! Faster!
Faster, Dickon! Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Here we go.
Go along, Honker.
I wish I could help.
Don't worry. We'll have you walking before you know it.
Me? Walk?
Do you think I could?
You have legs like everybody else.
But I never thought I--
Close your eyes, Colin.
Am I there?
Almost.
Now.
Yes.
I imagined this.
The pond was clogged when we first came.
Really?
Do you see that flower?
That's a cornflower. There's a robin's nest.
That's where I found the Empress of India.
I planted all those bulbs and seeds.
I'm going to come here tomorrow.
And the day after.
And the day after that.
See.
You must pull the weeds up...
...to give the flowers room.
Get off.
It's only a worm.
It's not '"ew.'"
See? He likes them, too.
Who's that man?
What are you doing in here?
How did you get in?
You awful, little busybody!
I couldn't bear you the first time
I set eyes on you.
It was the robin who showed me the door.
Do you know who I am?
Who you are?
You're the little cripple.
-If he's got a lump...
-I'm not a cripple!
...it's the size of a pin.
-Your back's not crooked?
-No!
And you haven't crooked legs?
Who said I had crooked legs?
No one ever said that.
You can do it.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Look at me.
Just look, you.
We didn't want you, but now you're here.
Don't say a word about it to anyone.
Send for you to help us sometimes.
I've come here before, when no one saw me.
Your mother...
...was so fond of this garden.
She would ask me to look after her roses.
She'd never ask anybody else.
When she went away, orders were no one were to come here.
But I come anyway.
She gave her orders first.
You know how to keep a secret.
Come inside. Be quick.
Oh, laddie.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
I'll meet him at the door.
-Are you making this magic?
-No.
You are.
It's like the story, the whole universe is in here.
I'm certain it is.
-I could marry you.
-What?
But we're cousins!
I don't care.
I want us always to be together.
We are together.
Come back.
See you tomorrow.
I'll be back tomorrow.
What's he doing?
What does he want?
He lost his mother.
He's hungry.
He's only a few days old.
He just learned how to walk.
You can hold him, if you like.
Be careful, Master Colin.
Where did he come from?
Three days ago...
...I was out on the moor.
I heard bleating under the bushes.
So, I started to look, and I looked...
...and I looked, and at last,
I seen a bit of gray by a rock.
So, I climbed up and there was the little one.
Off you go.
Go on. Go on.
Give me your hand.
You can do it.
You can do it.
You can do it.
You can do it.
You did it! You can walk!
I did it! I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
Are you a ghost?
It's me!
Medlock might hear you.
Then we wouldn't have to worry about her anymore.
She'd drop dead at the sight of you walking.
How did you get here?
I found the way by myself.
You climbed the stairs?
This is how I want it to be with my father.
I want to surprise him.
Just like this.
I want him to see me before anyone else does.
I wish we knew how to find him.
Medlock must know.
We can steal the address from her.
I'll have a fit, and when she comes running--
I saw a desk in your father's room.
It had lots of papers on it.
Maybe it's there.
I looked and I couldn't find the address.
But I discovered another of my uncle's secrets.
That's my mother.
I think that is my father.
That's me.
I think she's beautiful.
Attention!
Over here.
Smile.
Sit on the swing, Dickon.
Look at each other.
Now, look at me.
Come on, Dickon!
Stop all this.
I am well.
Write to my father and tell him to come back.
I do not believe you are well.
Your pulse is much too quick.
And there's a definite sign of fever in your eyes.
John, bring that ice.
Despite what you and your cousin may think, you're still under my care.
Your father trusts me to do what is best for you, and that's what I will do.
God, look at your legs.
They're all swollen and red.
Come on, Will.
If I'm so sick, you should send for my father.
You are to stay in bed.
You are not to go out into the gardens.
Give me the address and I'll write to him.
You'll do no such thing.
Give it to me.
I've had enough.
Between the wretched girl and the dangers of the fresh air...
...heaven knows what's happened to you.
You could be clotting.
She probably turned your chair over.
I won't stand for it. Not anymore.
I won't stand for any of it! Come on, John.
I'm keeping you children apart.
He is a very ill little boy.
I've worked too hard and too long to keep him alive...
...to have him killed by one pig-headed, meddlesome little girl like you.
Come on.
It's safe.
Everybody's gone.
Ben's waiting at the gate.
Thank you.
We're making magic here.
When I grow up,
I'll make great discoveries.
And this is my first experiment.
Aye.
'"Oh, great magic
'"Please come to me
'"Send me my father here
'"Set his spirit free
'"Oh, great magic
'"Please come to me
'"Send me my father here
'"Set his spirit free
'"Oh, great magic
'"Please come to me
'"Send me my father here
'"Set his spirit free
'"Oh, great magic
'"Please come to me
'"Send me my father here
'"Set his spirit free'"
Go!
Where are you?
In the garden! I'm in the garden!
I'm in the garden!
I'm in the garden...
...with Colin!
I must go.
I must go! Immediately!
I must go tonight. Prepare my bill.
His Lordship's just arrived!
His Lordship?
Where? Where is he?
Outside.
Get me out of this thing.
Will you get me out?
Get me out of it!
Oh, come on!
You're home, sir.
We weren't expecting you.
Here I am. Where's my son?
He's in his room, of course, Your Lordship.
Would you get back to the kitchen, impudent girl!
Where's my son?
He's here, my lord.
He must be here.
What's happened?
It's that child, my lord.
She's created absolute havoc here.
I've tried to control her.
She must be sent away, my lord.
She'll kill Master Colin...
...for sure.
Take me to her room.
She has no regard for his fragile state of health. She does what she pleases.
You lock her in?
I've had to, my lord.
That's how wild she is.
Mary?
Your uncle's here.
I beg your pardon, my lord.
Perhaps they're in the garden.
The garden?
How can they be?
It's quite impossible.
I've done my best, sir.
I really have.
But with that child defying me--
Silence, Medlock!
She's just a child.
I left you in charge.
I'll resign, sir.
I'll leave today.
Don't!
Around and around and around we go, and where we stop, nobody knows.
Catch me!
Come get me!
Where are you?
I can't believe it.
You're here.
The magic worked.
The garden.
Let me show you.
Mary found the key, she opened the door and went inside....
No one wants me!
This is where the robin has his nest.
See the babies?
They'll be flying soon.
This is where I walked first.
I was like a baby myself.
Why are you here by yourself?
It wasn't wanted.
What wasn't wanted?
The garden.
You're right.
I never wanted to see it again.
You never wanted to see Colin.
You brought us back to life, Mary.
You did something
I thought no one could do.
Don't be afraid.
I won't shut it up again.
Believe me.
Thank you.
Should we call Colin?
What's happening?
Did you see them?
Oh, look!
Master Colin.
Master Colin.
He's walking.
The spell was broken.
My uncle learned to laugh, and I learned to cry.
The secret garden is always open now.
Open...
...and awake and alive.
Ifyou look the right way...
...you can see that the whole world is a garden.
Oh, but this is great.
- Wow!
- ThaÃ¹s incredible.
There's gotta be at least seven or eight feet up there.
And 80 years of dust.
Look at all this height.
We could put our bedroom upstairs, and that will leave us with all this space.
- For what?
- Just space.
One, two, three!
- And four?
- Come on.
Four.
And five.
Watch... Watch this.
God, this place is huge.
- IÃ¹s beautiful.
- God.
- You guys, iÃ¹s absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.
A little paint.
I'd say you could sell this tomorrow and double your money.
- Carl, you're obsessed.
- A little bit.
Whoa, look.
Hey, iÃ¹s an Indian-head penny.
- IÃ¹s a good omen.
- You're the good omen.
Oh, iÃ¹s so great.
I had Rose move your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00,
'cause Gary Alan called at the end of the day yesterday and said he has to see you about the final painting bids for the loft.
3:00 is the only time he could make it.
Is that okay?
Sam?
What are you doing?
- Would you relax, man?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
This is not brain surgery you're going into.
Pitching these Japanese guys makes me so nervous.
Sam, you're going to be great. Okay?
I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I mean, I can't very well tell them my
Swedish pom-pom girl joke, you know.
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?
Nice, huh? Molly.
What do you think? Are they me?
Oh, man, look at that. A Testarossa.
I think you ought to pay off your Mustang first.
How you feeling?
WhaÃ¹d the doctor say?
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...
- No.
- Yeah.
He said that I shouldn't even be coming in today.
- What about the rash?
- The rash?
The rash is also incredibly contagious.
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No.
- On your genitals again?
- Yeah, yeah. Right on the genitals.
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- You're sick.
- I know.
- Good morning, Paul.
- Good morning, Carl. Sam.
Hey, Paul.
- Morning, Mr. Wheat.
- Morning, Susan. You are looking good.
Sam.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Here it is.
- Thanks.
- Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning, Rose.
- Oh, listen, the Kobiashi people...
- They're already here.
- They're early.
- I know.
Come here.
Oh, and Andy Dillon called...
- How long have they been here?
- About 10 minutes.
Andy Dillon called and he says he needs $900,000 transferred to Albany by 10:00.
- By 10:00?
- Yes.
Excuse me.
- Carl?
- Yeah?
- Good morning.
- Carl.
Bill, hang on one second.
Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by 10:00.
Can you transfer it to his payroll account?
- Yeah, I'm gonna need your MAC code.
- Okay.
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Okay, thanks.
Yeah. Bill, I'm going to call you back. Okay.
Okay, okay, thaÃ¹s fine. IÃ¹s fine. IÃ¹s fine!
Man, iÃ¹s too far out.
Can you get this, man?
Where are you guys from, the New York City Ballet?
Almost.
- Saved your life.
- You shit. You scared me to death.
Why did you do that?
IÃ¹s better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the place.
Look out. Look out.
Grab it.
- Sam, Mol, are you guys home?
- ThaÃ¹s Carl. Did you invite him?
- Slave labor.
- Carl.
- What?
- Hurry, help.
Oh, my God.
- Near the bottom.
- I got it.
- Now go down.
- What? Just down here?
Yeah.
- Just right here?
- Watch your toes.
I got it.
- Hey, where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.
Good girl.
- God, this place looks great.
- Yeah.
- You like it, huh?
- Like? Like is hardly the word.
I had no idea iÃ¹d be this beautiful.
IÃ¹s incredible.
Molly, what about her?
Well, why don't we just leave her there until we get the other stuff in?
- We can figure out...
- What are these?
Oh, let me show you.
Hey, you wanna help me lift this up?
- What, here?
- Yeah.
Wow.
- I just finished it. What do you think?
- IÃ¹s fantastic. I love it.
Sam, whaÃ¹s this chair doing here?
- What do you mean? I love that chair.
- I know you love this chair.
- But we discussed this and...
- Yeah, I've had it forever.
I mean just, when I watch TV, I sit in it.
- Baby, this chair is ugly.
- So?
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.
You're right. It does.
- We'll paint it.
- We'll what?
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- WhaÃ¹s the matter?
- Nothing.
Are you worried about the promotion?
No, not really.
- Then what? Is it moving in together?
- No.
I don't know. IÃ¹s a lot of things.
I just don't want the bubble to burst.
It seems like whenever anything good in my life happens,
I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.
I love you. I really love you.
Ditto.
The piloÃ¹s first report of trouble was that he blew the number two engine, the one in the tail of the plane.
It was fully loaded.
Oh, Jesus, another one.
Oh, don't watch that.
I should cancel my LA trip.
These things always happen in threes.
Sam, get serious.
Besides, you lead a charmed life.
Oh, yeah. So did they.
IÃ¹s amazing, just like that. Blackout.
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep.
Boy, I really must have passed out.
- What time is it?
- IÃ¹s 2:00 a.m.
Oh, no. I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.
Well, iÃ¹s not now.
- Can I help?
- Yeah.
Put your hands up here. Get them wet.
Now, just let the clay slide between your fingers.
Oh, no.
- WhaÃ¹s the matter?
- A glitch. WhaÃ¹s up?
The Mark Greenberg and Larry White accounts.
I can't get in.
The MAC code doesn't work.
- No, I changed it.
- You changed it? Why?
Nothing. I just want to nose around a bit.
Is something wrong?
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah, sure.
WhaÃ¹s up?
There's too much money in these accounts.
Too much money?
ThaÃ¹s impossible. How could there be...
C72273.
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.
It already has taken me hours.
Well, let me take it back and figure it out for you.
No, no, thaÃ¹s okay.
IÃ¹s... IÃ¹s like a vendetta now.
- Thanks, though. I appreciate it.
- Okay.
- Lf you start to go blind, just shout.
- Okay.
Listen, I was wondering, what are you and Mol doing tonight?
We're going to the theater.
She wants to see Macbeth.
I think she likes the guys in tights, personally.
- You want to go?
- No, thanks.
I want a full report, though.
- Later.
- Yeah.
Wonderful.
Excellent. Great.
- Well, I loved it.
- Yes.
I was spellbound the whole time.
I could tell.
And so could the rest of the audience with that resonating snore of yours.
Did I tell you what Melissa said?
- Yeah, about six times.
- It wasn't six times.
- Now quit being so blasÃ about this.
- Okay.
Now, this is really important.
I'm gonna have two pieces in her gallery.
The New York Times reviews her gallery all the time.
Molly, The New York Times is just some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school.
So who cares what they think?
About eight million readers, thaÃ¹s who.
Nah, they're just reading the sports page.
- Your work is really beautiful. It really is.
- Thanks.
And it shouldn't matter what anyone else thinks. Just what I think.
I want to marry you, Sam.
What? What?
Yep.
I've been thinking about it.
I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think we should just do it.
- You're serious.
- Yeah.
WhaÃ¹s that look for?
You never wanted to talk about it.
- Do you love me, Sam?
- Now, what do you think?
Why don't you ever say it?
What do you mean, why don't I ever say it?
- I say it all the time. I feel like...
- No, you don't.
You say, "Ditto," and thaÃ¹s not the same.
People say "I love you" all the time, and it doesn't mean anything.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
I need to hear it.
LeÃ¹s go.
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.
- What do you want?
- Shit.
Your wallet. Give it to me!
- Sam, just give it to him.
- Okay.
Just take the money. Just leave us...
No, no, Sam!
You son of a bitch!
Sam, no!
Somebody help us!
Jesus Christ! Sam!
Just get off!
Somebody! Somebody help us!
Sam, just let...
Sam, just stop it! Stop it, Sam!
Molly?
Molly? He got...
Oh, baby, hold on.
You're gonna be okay.
Somebody! Somebody!
Somebody help us!
Sam. Oh, my God.
Oh, Sam, come on. Hold on, baby.
Someone's gonna come.
We're gonna be okay.
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Please, anybody.
Help me, please, help me.
IÃ¹s okay, lady. Take it easy, all right?
Oh, God!
We'll help you, okay?
Molly? Molly? Molly?
Molly.
What should we do?
What should we do?
What? WhaÃ¹s happening? WhaÃ¹s...
Is he breathing?
Is he breathing?
I don't know if he's breathing.
Oh, God, Sam, hold on.
Hold on, baby. Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Come on, man.
All right. Okay, come on, iÃ¹s all right.
Here we go.
All right, there you go. One, two...
Sam, don't you leave me! Sam, hold on!
Sam!
Oh, Sam!
...emergency room.
All right. Right away.
Miss Jensen, if you'll step this way, please.
Cardiology, please dial extension 255...
- So, what happened to you?
- What?
You're new, huh? I can tell.
- Are you talking to me?
- Hey, relax.
It ain't like before, you know.
IÃ¹s a whole new ball of wax.
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm waiting for my wife.
She's in 4C, cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.
Shot, huh? ThaÃ¹ll do it every time.
Poor bastard.
Hey, you may as well get used to it.
You could be here for a long while.
Come here, I'll tell you a secret.
Doors ain't as bad as you think.
Zip, zap, they ain't nothing at all.
You'll see. You'll catch on.
This patienÃ¹s fibrillating.
Where's the paddles?
Get them up here.
He ain't gonna make it.
I've seen it a million times.
He's a goner.
- He's still fibrillating.
- Clear.
Clear.
You see? Here they come.
Lucky bastard.
It could have been the other ones.
You never know.
Who are...
Nursing supervisor, dial the operator, please.
Nursing supervisor, dial the operator.
No!
Help me.
Oh, God, help me.
"I am sunk in the abysmal swamp where there is no foothold.
"I have reached the watery depths.
"The flood overwhelms me.
"I am wearied with calling."
As we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit.
All that we treasure, our loved ones, our friends, our body, our mind, are but on loan to us.
We must surrender them all.
We are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end.
As our loved one enters eternal life, let us remember that love too is eternal.
That although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.
I picked up your shirts today.
I don't know why.
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you hello.
I broke into tears.
IÃ¹s like I think about you every minute.
IÃ¹s like I can still feel you.
I'm here, Mol.
Floyd, whaÃ¹s the matter, kitty?
WhaÃ¹s the matter?
Crazy cat.
Sam?
ThaÃ¹s really stupid.
- I love this picture.
- IÃ¹s great.
Office.
Oh, let me see that.
IÃ¹s...
- Sam's address book.
- Right.
Dave Brubeck, Newport, '88.
- Should I toss them?
- No.
No? Molly, we hated that concert.
Hey.
- Oh, you wanted to save those?
- Rolaids?
Molly, what are you doing?
- I just miss him, Carl.
- Me, too.
- Carl?
- Yeah?
Wait a minute. Wait.
- What?
- Not that one.
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to put that on there.
- ThaÃ¹s okay.
Hey, Molly, why don't you come?
IÃ¹s like summer outside.
No, I really don't. I... I'm not up for it.
Come on, Mol, just for a walk.
- IÃ¹d be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.
Molly, you can't stay in here all day.
- IÃ¹s not healthy for you.
- Look, Carl, I can't do it!
Molly, you're not the one who died.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.
Shit.
Maybe you're right.
- Maybe just a short one.
- Attagirl.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Molly?
What are you doing here?
You bastard.
You son of a bitch!
What do you want?
Molly?
Molly, get out!
Oh, my God.
No, Molly. No, Molly, no, no. Please, no.
Molly, Molly, he's got a gun. Molly!
Hi, kitty. Hi.
You hurt her, I'll kill...
Molly.
Shit.
Is somebody there? Hello?
Hello?
What are you doing?
Let go! What are you doing?
No!
Like trains?
Stay out! This is mine!
Shit.
IÃ¹s me. I couldn't get it.
She came home.
In a couple of days, man. I'll go back.
Relax, I'll get it.
Get what?
Who are you?
What do you want from us?
No. You stay away from her.
Do you hear me?
You stay away from her!
Rosa Santiago?
Please be seated.
Our sister will be with us soon.
Sister Oda Mae, grant us the gift of your all-seeing presence.
Appear before us now.
Mrs. Santiago?
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
I understand you wish to contact your husband.
I believe he'll be with us today.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
But you know, Mrs. Santiago, there's no telling about that other world.
So you've got to be a believer,
Mrs. Santiago.
- Are you a believer?
- SÃ. SÃ. I believe. I believe.
Then let us begin.
I can't. I can't. IÃ¹s too difficult.
I just can't seem to make contact.
I... I don't feel his... No, wait!
I'm feeling something.
Did he know someone by the name of Anna?
Consuelo? Lucita? Julietta?
Josephina? Linda? Maria?
SÃ, sÃ. His mama. She is Maria.
Yes. Praise God!
I knew he was with his mama.
Oh, my God.
IÃ¹s too difficult. IÃ¹s two of them.
I'm not sure I can do that.
- IÃ¹s so trying... IÃ¹s...
- Oh, I pay more.
- How much? How much?
Oh, way to go. Milk her for every penny.
Yes, I believe we can start again.
Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.
- My husband?
- Have mercy!
Oh, yeah? Where?
- Julio?
- Yes.
I feel his vibration.
I see him!
How is he? How does he look?
Oh, he's a handsome man.
Handsome?
Mrs. Santiago, in our Father's kingdom, we're all handsome.
Oh, Julio.
Julio's coming towards us. I see him!
He's coming! He's there!
He's dressed in a black suit.
Black suit?
Could be blue.
What a crock of shit.
- Who is that?
- Julio?
- Where are you?
- Julio? Julio?
Did you hear it? Damn.
- Where are you?
- Julio?
- Who are you?
- Who?
Julio? Julio?
- You can hear me?
- Don't you hear him?
I don't believe this.
Hey, you! Hey, you!
My name is Sam Wheat.
Listen, can you hear me? Sam Wheat.
Say my name. Say it.
- Leave me alone! Stop it!
- Say my name. Say it! Sam Wheat.
Say my name. Sam Wheat. Say it.
Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.
Sam Wheat!
Jesus.
- Sam Wheat?
- Sam Wheat?
I swear, no more cheating. I promise.
I'll do anything. I'll do penance.
Give me penance, but make that guy go away.
No way.
IÃ¹s okay.
IÃ¹s okay.
All right, Sister.
- I can't...
- Yeah, you're all right.
My mother had it.
And my mother's mother had it.
They... They both had the gift.
And they always said I had it, but I never did. I never had it.
They told me what it was like.
They told me all about it.
But now that I got it, I...
I don't think I want it.
So, do me a favor, just go away.
Find somebody else.
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.
Yeah, I'm getting there fast.
Well, I think she hit her head harder than we think.
Well, she was talking to nobody that wasn't there before she even hit her head.
Well, I know she is.
But you know, Sister can do that.
- Where exactly are you?
- I'm standing right beside you.
- Oh, you're standing right beside me?
- Well, honey, we're right here.
- Are you white?
- What?
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?
Oh, God, you know what I think?
Yes, I'm gonna call the doctor right now.
- I knew it. IÃ¹s a white guy. Why me?
- Listen, damn it.
You are going to help me.
There's a woman.
Her name is Molly Jensen, and she's in terrible danger.
The man who killed me broke into our apartment and he's gonna go back.
So you've gotta warn her.
Just what makes you think she's gonna listen to me?
IÃ¹s just a phone call.
Look, you're all I've got.
Now, I'm not leaving until you help me.
I don't care how long it takes,
'cause I can talk forever.
She's talking to white people in the room.
- Hello?
- Hi.
- Is this Molly Jensen?
- Yes.
Well, my name is Oda Mae Brown.
I'm a spiritual reader and advisor, and a friend of yours gave me a message for you.
Now, I know this is gonna sound a little crazy, but iÃ¹s not, and you gotta believe me.
Just don't be afraid.
Who is this?
I got a message from Sam.
What?
Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.
- I told you.
- You gotta go there.
Forget it. I'm not going anywhere.
I don't care what you do.

All right, all right, all right! Stop singing!
I'll go anywhere you want to!
Just don't sing anymore!
I can't believe this.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
What am I doing down here?
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.
She's probably not even there.
Where are you?
Which building is it?
- Which one?
- Push three.
- See? Nobody's there.
- She's there. Just wait. Just wait.
Look, no. I came down here,
I did everything I said I was gonna do.
I pressed the button. She's not there.
I'm gone. Goodbye.
- Just wait one minute.
- I'm sorry.
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
Ninety-nine bottles of beer
Take one down and pass it around
All right, don't sing!
All right, all right, all right!
- Hello?
- Yes, hi.
She can't hear you.
Hi, I'm Oda Mae.
You know, I called you last night about your friend Sam Wheat.
I told you.
Hey, Molly!
Molly Jensen, I know you're up there!
I know you hear me! I'm down here!
Sam wants to talk to you!
This is for real!
Hey, you remember the starfish in Montego Bay?
How would I know that if he wasn't here?
Hey, Molly!
I know about the green underwear that you wrote your name on!
I'd never get over that, I'll tell you that.
I know about the picture in Reno.
Hey, Molly!
Ask her about the sweater she knitted, in the closet, thaÃ¹s too big.
He just asked me to remind you of the sweater thaÃ¹s in the closet that you knitted is too big!
Four sizes!
Hey, you hear me talking to you?
- I hear you.
- Oh, shut up. Nobody's talking to you.
Didn't you ever hear of a phone?
Wanna kiss my butt?
- I'm not gonna stay down here all day!
- Thank God.
Oh, man, shut up!
Molly!
I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm out of here.
One, two, three.
- No, Oda. Wait.
- No.
IÃ¹s Molly.
Molly?
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
I don't know you.
I don't know this guy, Sam.
But let me tell you what he did to me.
He kept me up all night singing
I'm Henry Vlll, I am.
ThaÃ¹s how he got me to go out with him.
Look, I'm sorry.
I just don't believe in this life-after-death stuff.
- Well, tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.
- You're talking to him right now?
- Yeah.
He just asked me to tell you that you were wrong.
- So, where is he?
- I can't see him. I can only hear him.
I'm right here.
That doesn't help, Sam.
I'm holding her hand.
He says he's holding your hand.
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing to me?
Hey, look, if you think I'd come all the way down here for my health, you're out of your mind.
Sam's dead. Okay? He's dead.
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.
Sam would never say that.
Ditto! Tell her ditto.
What the hell is ditto? Ditto!
Man, to tell you the truth,
I don't know how I'm doing this.
You know, confidentially, nothing like this has ever happened to me before.
I mean, nothing.
And now I can't turn it off.
Is this him? Is this you?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Cute. White, but cute.
What I don't understand is why did he come back?
- I don't know.
- Why is he still here?
He's stuck, thaÃ¹s what it is.
He's in between worlds.
You know, it happens sometimes.
The spirit gets yanked out so quick that the essence still feels like it has work to do here.
- Would you stop rambling?
- I don't think I'm rambling.
I'm just answering her question.
- He's got an attitude now.
- I don't have an attitude.
Yes, you do have an attitude.
We're having a little discussion.
If you didn't have an attitude, you would not have raised your voice to me, now, would you?
- God damn it, Oda Mae.
- Don't you "God damn it" me.
Don't you take the LorÃs name in vain with me, you understand?
- I don't take that.
- Would you relax?
No, you relax. You're the dead guy.
You want me to help you?
You better apologize.
- Because I don't take that from anybody.
- Jesus Christ!
- ThaÃ¹s it, I'm leaving.
- What are you doing?
I'm leaving. Nobody talks to me like that.
You understand me?
- Now you better apologize.
- I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay?
Now would you sit down? Please?
He's apologized.
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying, but you have to tell her word for word, all right?
- Word for word.
- Yes.
He wants me to tell you what he's saying word for word.
Molly, you're in danger.
Now you can't just blurt it out like that.
And quit moving around, will you?
'Cause you're starting to make me dizzy.
I'll just tell her in my own way.
Molly, you in danger, girl.
What are you talking about?
I know the man who killed me.
He knows the man who killed him.
His name is Willie Lopez, and I know where he lives.
His name is Willie Lopez.
He's Puerto Rican.
He knows where he lives.
- Write it down.
- He wants you to write it down.
- You write it down.
- I ain't no damn secretary.
Just do it!
He's so testy.
What is it you want me to write?
IÃ¹s 303 Prospect Place, apartment 4D.
- 303 Prospect Place?
- Yeah.
ThaÃ¹s my neighborhood.
Molly, he's got my wallet, he's got my key, and he was in here.
He's got his wallet and his key, and he was in here.
Yesterday when you came back from your walk with Carl, you went up the stairs, you talked to Floyd,
- you went in, took off your clothes...
- All right, all right.
When you came in yesterday from your walk with Carl, he was here.
You took your clothes off.
He saw everything.
Molly, you got to go to the police.
It was a set-up.
I was murdered.
He wants you to go to the police.
He said it was a set-up.
He was murdered.
- There's somebody else involved.
- Look, forget it.
- I don't know who, but...
- I don't want no more
- to do with this, okay?
- Wait.
- Where are you going?
- What do you mean, where am I going?
I'm leaving.
I did everything I said I was going to do.
And don't be following me,
'cause I'm finished. And I mean it.
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death. Goodbye.
Molly, there's no one on earth besides you who'd want this to be true more than me.
But you've got to be rational about this.
I mean, Sam is no more in this room than...
Look, I understand the need to hang on to him.
I really do. But this is absurd.
I know this seems absurd.
But it had to be real.
How could you believe some fortuneteller from Brooklyn who just shows up at your door?
I sat there and watched her have a conversation with him.
I don't buy it, Mol. Not for a minute.
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?
The photo that Sam took of me on our trip to Reno.
Carl, we were alone.
And the green underwear that I wrote my name in.
- She said Sam knew who killed him.
- Yeah.
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.
We're going off the deep end here.
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly, good.
Willie Lopez.
303 Prospect Place, apartment 4D.
This is sick.
Oh, Carl.
This is really sick.
Oh, God.
Molly, I don't understand how you could swallow this crap.
I mean, this guy may not even exist.
This woman, maybe she's just trying to use you to set someone up.
You're right. You're absolutely right.
No.
ThaÃ¹s what I got to find out.
What do you mean, find out?
How are you gonna do that?
Well, she said Sam wants me to go to the police.
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus, Molly.
Are you out of your mind?
I mean, what are you gonna tell the police?
Are you gonna tell them that some storefront psychic lady's been communing with the dead?
I mean, do you have any idea what that sounds like?
You're talking ghosts here, for ChrisÃ¹s sake.
I'm sorry.
IÃ¹s just this stuff just really gets to me, you know.
IÃ¹s okay if you don't believe me.
I'm trying to, Molly.
Look, if iÃ¹ll make you feel any better,
I'll go check this out, okay?
Now, why don't you try and get some sleep?
Okay? All right?
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.
All right. Good night.
Be careful.
Carl. What the hell are you doing here?
Who have you been talking to, Willie?
Talking to? What the hell do you mean?
Some woman knows all about you, everything.
- Now where's she getting it from, huh?
- I haven't said a word to anybody.
She knows your name, God damn it.
She knows where you live.
- A lot of women know where I live.
- This is not a joke!
She knows about the murder.
Now I want you to find this bitch, whoever she is.
And I want you to just get rid of her, okay?
I've got $4 million stuck in a goddamn computer.
If I don't get those codes, if that money is not transferred soon,
I'm... dead. We're both dead.
Why don't you tell them you only launder money on the first of the month?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Is everything a joke? You killed a man.
You were supposed to steal his wallet.
Was that a joke?
Man, I did you a favor, man.
That was a freebie.
Look, these are drug dealers, okay?
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
I'd lose my job. I could go to jail.
$80,000 of that money is mine.
Look, just let me have the key to Sam's apartment.
I'll get the address book myself, okay?
Bastard! You goddamn bastard!
Why? Why? You were my friend!
I had a life, God damn you. I had a life!
Look, I don't even believe in this stuff myself.
But she was real.
What? You think I'd come down here if it wasn't real?
You know, you told me if I had any new information that I should come.
So here I am.
I know how this sounds.
I mean, I hear myself saying it and I want to cringe.
But this woman knew things she couldn't have known.
Things Sam only said to me.
Okay, according to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place, watching us all the time, huh?
Well, hell, I'm never gonna get undressed again.
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.
All I'm asking you to do is check it out.
Okay.
You just wait here and let me see if the guy's got a record, all right?
Great.
What are you doing?
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for a Willie Lopez.
He was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with.
Now, this psychic woman's got a record that goes back a long way.
1967, Shreveport, forgery, selling false ID.
Served one year in 1971.
Baton Rouge, arrested for fraud.
Numbers racketeering, served 10 months, 1974, and...
Look, this is impossible.
- It goes on and on.
- She knew things. Private things.
Now, how could she have known all that?
A lot of times they read the obits.
All she had to do was see the word "banker." Boom.
Hell, they even go through your garbage to find things they can use.
Letters, old papers, it doesn't take much.
No.
It was real.
She knew about a sweater I knitted.
And songs we sang.
Our trip to Montego Bay.
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.
People want so much to believe.
They're grieving. They're vulnerable, and they will give anything for one last moment.
Believe me, these people know what they're doing.
And I know how you must feel, but you know you can press charges.
No.
Thank you.
Oh, God, let this be it.
Yes.
Hello?
- Eddie?
- Yeah.
- IÃ¹s Carl Bruner.
- WhaÃ¹s up?
I'm fine. Yeah, everything's fine.
Just, we're all set.
Good.
Just let me know what you want me to do.
Okay, I want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name Rita Miller.
Okay.
Tomorrow at five minutes before closing, 3:55 p.m., transfer the full account to the First Island Bank of Nassau, registry number 4869580.
- Call us when iÃ¹s done.
- Okay, I've got it.
Just tell Mr. Balistreri that there won't be any more problems, okay?
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Thank you.
Good work, Carl.
Molly, why can't you hear me?
I need you.
- Who is it?
- IÃ¹s Carl, Molly.
No. Don't open it, Molly.
Don't open the goddamn door.
He's a murderer.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Listen, sorry, I know iÃ¹s late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I just...
I've been thinking about you all day.
And I feel really lousy about...
About what happened last night.
This supernatural thing just really...
Listen, don't worry about it.
Really, iÃ¹s okay.
No, iÃ¹s not.
You needed me to hear you and I didn't.
I wasn't there for you, and that was...
That was wrong.
IÃ¹s just I... I just...
I want you to know that I'm your friend, Mol.
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never our friend.
- That really means a lot to me.
- Me, too.
So I brought you some Japanese apple-pears.
I know you like them.
Thanks. ThaÃ¹s very sweet.
Could I come in for a second?
I won't stay long.
IÃ¹s just been one of those days.
- Maybe a cup of coffee or something?
- Yeah.
- Come on in.
- No, Molly.
- You seem a little tense. Are you okay?
- No, I'm fine.
IÃ¹s just, God, what can I tell you?
IÃ¹s been tough.
IÃ¹s... I mean, you know, it just still hurts so much.
You lying snake.
And then on top of it, iÃ¹s stuff at work.
They've given me my own accounts, which is good.
But I just haven't really had time to adjust, kind of absorb everything.
IÃ¹s no big deal.
Yeah.
- Can I have just a little more cream?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit. Jesus. I can't believe I did that.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, God.
- Here, let me throw that in the washer.
- No, don't worry about it. IÃ¹s okay.
IÃ¹s just...
- You want me to get you another shirt?
- No, iÃ¹s fine. IÃ¹ll dry.
- Just take a minute.
- Here you go.
So where were you today?
I thought you were gonna come into the bank and sign those papers.
Well, I was supposed to, but I didn't have time.
I went to the police.
You did? Wow, what did you tell them?
What did they say?
It was awful.
I felt really stupid.
They brought out a file on this woman, and... At least 10 inches thick.
- A rip-off artist, huh?
- No, Molly.
You know, the sad thing is that I believed her.
Molly, sometimes we need to believe.
Why? WhaÃ¹s the point?
Molly, it is not easy to face the realities of life.
Sometimes you've gotta give yourself that.
What you've got to remember is the love that you guys felt.
I mean, thaÃ¹s whaÃ¹s real.
You've got to remember how good Sam was, how much he loved you.
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.
I feel so alone.
You're not alone, okay?
You've got your work.
You're incredibly talented. You're young.
You're fantastically gorgeous.
I don't know whaÃ¹s real anymore.
I don't know what to think.
Just think about Sam.
Think about the time you guys had together, how wonderful that was.
Yeah.
Let your feelings out, Molly. IÃ¹s okay.
Life turns on a dime.
You know?
I mean, people think that they have forever, that there's always gonna be tomorrow, but thaÃ¹s bullshit.
Sam taught us that.
You have to live for now, for today.
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- IÃ¹s okay.
- I can't. IÃ¹s just too soon.
- IÃ¹s okay.
You've been great, Carl.
- But I need you to leave.
- IÃ¹s okay. I understand, totally.
Please.
Could we just have dinner tomorrow night? Just talk.
Can I interest you in that?
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.
Hey.
- Get off my train.
- No.
Get off! Get off!
Get off! Get off! Get off!
- Get out of here. Get off.
- No.
Show me how you do that.
I want to learn, and I'm not leaving till you teach me.
- Get off!
- No.
Get off!
You stubborn asshole.
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I...
You're trying to move it with your finger.
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.
IÃ¹s all in your mind.
The problem with you is you still think you're real.
You think you're wearing those clothes?
You think you're crouched on that floor? Bullshit!
You ain't got a body no more, son.
IÃ¹s all up here now.
If you want to move something, you've got to move it with your mind.
You gotta focus.
You hear what I'm saying?
How? How do you focus?
I don't know how you focus.
You just focus.
- How did you do that?
- You gotta take all your emotions, all your anger, all your love, all your hate, and push it way down here into the pit of your stomach.
And then let it explode like a reactor.
Okay, okay.
Don't laugh!
Way to go, kid!
I did it.
- I did it.
- Way to go.
From your gut, like I told you.
Give it time. What else have you got?
How long have you been here?
Since they pushed me.
- Someone pushed you?
- Yes, someone pushed me.
- Who?
- What, you don't believe me?
You think I fell? You think I jumped?
Well, fuck you!
It wasn't my time.
I wasn't supposed to go!
I'm not supposed to be here!
Oh, I'd give anything for a drag.
Just one drag!
Are you all right?
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Yes!
...so you need to concentrate,
'cause if you concentrate, you'll probably rouse him.
- Now whaÃ¹s his name again?
- Orlando.
Orlando.
Orlando, Orlando, is there an Orlando here?
- I'm here.
- He's here.
- Oda Mae, I...
- Sam!
- What the hell?
- Excuse me, I'm Orlando.
The line's over there.
Oda Mae, where did all these ghosts come from?
- You can hear them, too?
- Hear them? Can I hear them?
I hear them in the morning.
I hear them in the evening.
They're coming into the shower.
Sam, what the hell did you do to me?
Did you tell every spook in the world you met about me?
I got spooks from Jersey coming in here.
Jesus.
There's stuff going on you wouldn't believe.
I don't even believe it.
- IÃ¹s amazing. You're really doing it.
- Yes, I know.
How do you like that?
- Can you two please hurry this up?
- Oh, chill out. Chill out!
Listen, I need your help again,
Oda Mae.
- There's something we need to do.
- No.
I'm not doing anything else with you, Sam.
Look, you're holding onto a life that doesn't want you anymore.
It doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.
Are you speaking to me?
Does it look like I'm speaking to you?
You'll know when I'm talking to you.
You supposed to be concentrating, aren't you?
Now, you want to try it?
Thank you very much.
Now, Sam, are you gonna get out of here?
'Cause I got work to do.
Fine, then stay there.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
You ready now?
LeÃ¹s do it.
Oda Mae, listen.
I got to talk to you now. I've got a plan.
You see, I figured this thing out.
There's something we can do.
All we got to do is...
Oda Mae?
Oda Mae?
Ortisha?
Orlando? Is that you?
Ortisha, where are you at?
I can't hardly see.
- Here. She's here.
- In front of you. I'm right here.
Damn, baby!
WhaÃ¹d you do to your hair?
Orlando, you like it?
IÃ¹s Autumn Sunrise.
Get out of me, you son of a bitch!
Don't you ever do that to me again.
Orlando!
- I can barely move.
- Now, you should know better than that.
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.
Everybody out!
What happened to Orlando?
Where's the insurance policy?
Are you deaf? I said everybody out!
Everybody out! Get out, get out, get out!
Everybody get out!
Get out!
- You the fortuneteller?
- Who are you?
ThaÃ¹s an interesting question.
Why don't you tell me?
- Willie.
- Willie?
Prospect Place Willie?
Get out of here! Fast!
- Sister! Sister!
- Oda Mae!
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Oda Mae, we're in trouble, so you've got to help me.
What do you mean we? Who's we?
You're already dead.
Don't you understand?
These people are trying to kill me.
Yeah, you're right. And they'll be back.
Look, why don't you just find a house to haunt, you know?
Get some chains and rattle them or something.
Will you listen to me?
I have a plan and it will work.
But you've gotta get some of your fake IDs.
Forget it.
If you do this, they'll never bother you again, I promise.
Scouts' honor.
All right.
What do I have to do?
What exactly do I have to do?
You got a nice dress?
I don't see whaÃ¹s wrong with what I'm wearing.
I'm sorry I made a joke.
I love your shoes.
No, I don't think you do.
You know, I think I'm gonna go home.
I'm going home because
I don't know anything about banking.
I don't know that this is gonna work.
- Oda Mae, would you just relax?
- Listen, I'm nervous.
Please donate.
I know you're nervous, but I will get you through it.
- And the fake driver's license is great.
- Oh, Sam, I don't think I can do this.
You can do it. Straight ahead of you.
A stairway that says, "New Accounts."
- ThaÃ¹s where we're going.
- I'm not giving them no money.
- Just do what I say and don't talk.
- Okay.
Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm here to fill out a signature card for a new account.
And do you know your account number?
- Rita Miller.
- Who?
- What?
- Tell her Rita Miller.
Rita Miller.
Didn't they have you sign a card when you opened the account?
Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today.
You see, Carl Bruner, he opened it for me by phone, that account, and now he's asked me to come in today.
I see.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
All right.
Just sign this card on the bottom line, please.
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.
No, no, no! Rita Miller.
I'm so sorry.
You know, I... I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.
Now, tell her to make sure it goes straight up to the third floor file, because you have a transaction to make.
Please make sure this goes right up to the third floor file, because I have a transfusion to make.
- A what?
- LeÃ¹s go.
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.
- I just love these pens.
- Then keep the pen.
- Why are you always making me...
- What do you want to keep the pen for?
- Carl Bruner speaking.
- Hi, Carl.
- Mr. Balistreri.
- Balistreri?
- Carl, iÃ¹s me, John.
- John, John. Sorry.
What... What... WhaÃ¹s up?
I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio.
Oh, right, okay, look, I'll just...
I'll pick it up later. All right?
- All right. I'll be here till 6:00.
- Good.
This is it.
I don't suppose I can talk you into losing the hat.
You keep messing with me, you'll be here by yourself.
Tell the guard you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.
Lyle Ferguson.
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I'm here for my health.
Don't say that.
Tell him Rita Miller's here.
You just tell him Rita Miller's here.
Just one moment, please.
Don't embellish.
Excuse me?
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.
I've known him for five years, and he still thinks my name's...
- Why are you whispering?
- Just be quiet and listen.
He's a social moron, so you don't have anything to worry about.
Just tell the guard Ferguson knows you.
You spent time with him and his wife, Shirley, at the Brewster's Christmas party last year. Got it?
- What is this in regards to?
- What?
He doesn't remember me?
Oh, we spent all that time at the
Brewster's Christmas party last year.
He and his lovely wife, Shirley.
It was beautiful.
A big old tree and thousands of presents everywhere. It...
Gas.
I get a little gas from time to time.
ThaÃ¹s all. Gas.
- Quit poking me!
- Well, don't overdo it.
Now, listen, this'll be easy.
Ferguson was so drunk at that party, he coulÃve had a conversation with Tina Turner and he wouldn't remember.
- I don't know, Sam.
- Here we go.
Hello. Hello. Yes.
Of course, yes.
Well, iÃ¹s been a long time.
Oh, a long time.
Ask how Bobby and Snooky are doing.
By the way, how are Bobby and Snooky doing?
Fine. Fine. Thank you.
Thank you for asking.
And how is your family?
Oh, couldn't be better.
Well, wonderful.
Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities.
I was just wondering, how did you do on the Gibraltar securities?
The Gibraltar securities?
Well, it looks like we topped out on that one, huh?
- We sure did.
- We sure did.
- That was a very useful tip.
- Good old Randy.
- Good old Randy.
- Right.
Got a good old head on his shoulders.
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.
Yeah. So, what...
What brings you here today?
- You're closing an account.
- I'm closing an account.
Well, wonderful.
Do you have your account number?
- Yes?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Good.
Well, Rita, it looks like you'll be withdrawing
$4 million from us today.
- $4 million?
- Say yes. Say yes!
- Is that correct?
- Yes.
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
- ThaÃ¹s correct. Yes.
- Easy, easy.
Yes.
Well, how would you like that?
- Tens and twenties.
- Pardon?
Cashier's check.
Tell him a cashier's check.
I think better, a cashier's check.
A cashier's check. Fine.
Well, of course, you know, we require identification from everyone.
- IÃ¹s just procedural.
- Oh, ID! Yes.
You know, I...
Thank you. Well, I'll be right back.
$4 million!
Yeah, get me the First Island Bank of Nassau. IÃ¹s on the Rolodex.
Well, we have some things for you to sign here.
This officially closes the account.
And here you are.
Now, sign Rita Miller.
Rita Miller. ThaÃ¹s my name.
My name. Rita Miller. My name.
My name.
- Molly, hi. IÃ¹s good to see you.
- Hi.
- Oda Mae, I'll be right back.
- A few more if you would, please.
Just anywhere?
Right here.
Fine.
The check.
This... Here you are.
The person you need to see is right down at the end.
Okay, thanks.
Mama took the money that she made in the oil wells, and she sunk it into gas pumps.
You know, how they have at the gas station?
And those gas stations have five or six of those things, so iÃ¹s very, very lucrative.
- Oda Mae.
- It really adds up.
- Oda Mae, we've gotta go. Say goodbye.
- Well, gotta go now.
IÃ¹s been a pleasure doing business with you, a real pleasure.
Now, may I keep the pen?
Say good night to Bobby and Snooky for me.
I'll see you. Bye-bye.
Why are you rushing me?
What is wrong?
- Excuse me. Lyle?
- Oh, yes...
- Molly Jensen.
- Molly.
The woman you were just doing business with.
- Yeah?
- What did she want?
I mean, did it have anything to do with me or with Sam?
Sam? Why, no. No.
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right?
- No, her name was Rita Miller, and she was closing an account.
- Why? Is there a problem?
- No. I guess not.
Thank you.
Carl, is something wrong?
Is somebody playing with the computers?
- What?
- One of my accounts is closed.
Which account? WhaÃ¹s wrong?
You want me to call someone?
No, iÃ¹s okay. I can do it. I got it.
$4 million!
Oh, my God, what am I gonna do with this money?
I... You know,
I'm gonna buy the building.
No, no, wait. I'm gonna buy the block.
I'm gonna make my sister go to a fat farm, because, you know, she's way too big.
Whoa, wait! What are you gonna do...
Then I'm gonna...
Yeah, I'm gonna buy the building.
Wait, wait, wait, Oda Mae,
I've got an idea.
- Take the check out of your purse.
- Oh, you're right. You're right.
I should take it out.
I should put it where nobody can get it.
No, no, no. Endorse it.
No, if I endorse it, then if I drop it, somebody will get it. No, I'll just...
IÃ¹s not your money.
I never said you were gonna get the money.
This is blood money.
I was killed for this money.
- Now, endorse the check.
- I know, but...
Well, Sam, what are you gonna do with it?
Look over there, to your left.
I know you don't think I'm giving this
$4 million to a bunch of nuns!
Oda Mae, if you don't do it, they will track you down.
Your only protection is to get rid of it.
Oh, Sam, come on. You're killing me!
IÃ¹s $4 million!
Just think of it this way, you'll go to heaven.
I don't want to go to heaven!
I want to go to a bank and cash the goddamn check!
- Hello.
- Yeah.
- You'll thank me later.
- How are you doing?
- Now, endorse it Rita Miller.
- I know.
Make it out to St. Joseph's Shelter.
I can't believe you're making me do this.
Now, give it to her.
I will, I will. I just want to feel it one more time in my fingers, thaÃ¹s all.
- Just give the lady the check.
- I will!
Hand her the check. You can do it.
- Give her the check.
- I will.
Bless you, child. Bless you.
Give it to her. Let go. Let go!
Shit.
I'm proud of you, Oda Mae.
You know something, Sam?
I don't care if you're proud of me.
You stay away from me from now on.
What is that nun going to do with it?
She can't even buy underwear. Nothing.
I hate you. Leave me alone.
Never talk to me again.
I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.
Go ahead, search. You'll never find it.
They're gonna kill you, Carl.
You and Willie, you're gonna be fertilizer.
They're gonna bury you right next to Jimmy Hoffa.
Who's doing that?
Who's doing that?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.
I know, Mol. I'm sorry.
Things got a little crazy. I just forgot.
Yeah, had a little trouble at the bank.
- You forgot?
- Yeah.
You know, I wish you would have called me, because I've been really worried.
Listen to me, Molly,
I gotta ask you about something.
Yeah, he needs to borrow $4 million.
When you said that you thought that Sam was here, that he was talking to you, what did you feel?
What did he say to you?
Why? What does that have to do with anything?
IÃ¹s just... Listen to me for a second.
This psychic lady,
I want to know what she told you.
- I wanna know exactly what she said.
- Carl, let me go. Carl, stop this.
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.
What the hell happened to you tonight?
Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today?
The bank?
Yeah, Ferguson said she closed an account.
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
IÃ¹s Rita Miller or something.
Carl, are you all right?
IÃ¹s just my stomach...
Jesus.
Do you have any, like, I don't know, some Pepto-Bismol or something?
- Cyanide.
- Yeah. IÃ¹s upstairs.
Why don't you sit down, and I'll get it?
WhaÃ¹s wrong? Does little Carl have a little tummy ache?
What are you doing to me?
Now do you believe in ghosts?
I'll set the place on fire, I swear to God.
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl.
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.
I need that money, and I want it tonight at 11:00.
If that psychic lady does not bring it here,
Molly is dead. Okay?
- Carl, who are you talking to?
- Nothing. Now, Molly, listen to me.
I have to go, okay?
I can't explain this now, but there is a problem, okay?
- Something's going on at the bank.
- Carl, you're really scaring me.
I'm sorry, Mol.
Look, I don't have time to talk now, but I'll come back about 11:00.
- Why? Why not now?
- Molly, I can't talk now.
Molly, look, I'll come back.
What do you say? Like, 11:00, okay?
I'm sorry to do this to you, Molly, but iÃ¹s really important.
I gotta go. Okay?
- Oda Mae!
I'm Arsenio Hall.
Don't try to adjust your television.
I'm black.
- I want to watch Love Connection.
- I love Love Connection.
- I love that man on there.
- Leave that! ThaÃ¹s Arsenio.
- So?
- What do you mean, so?
You love Love Connection, you ought to send your picture in there.
She did already.
They just haven't answered yet.
- Oda Mae?
- Sam?
- Oh, no. Not again.
- Oda Mae, we're in trouble.
They want the check, and they're coming for you.
So you gotta get out of here.
What do you mean, they want the check?
The check you said they would never know about?
- Oda Mae, whaÃ¹s happening?
- Sam.
They're here! They're here!
Get out of here! Now! Go!
- Come on. We gotta go!
- WhaÃ¹s the matter?
Come on, come on!
Just knock on the door here.
Help! Help!
- IÃ¹s an emergency. You gotta let us in.
- Who are you kidding?
Open up!
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.
The cat don't like visitors.
She'll pee all over that...
They're gonna get us.
Where's Sam?
- Shit! It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.
Carl?
Shit!
Willie!
Hey, man, you got a serious problem, man.
Help me! Help!
That dude is dead.
You're dead, Willie.
No! No! No!
Help me!
Tell the driver to hurry.
Yo, man, you wanna step on it, please?
Listen, lady, I'm driving as fast as I can.
Problems?
- Carl, is that you?
- No, iÃ¹s me, Oda Mae.
Listen. Molly,
I know what you think of me.
I know what you think of me, but, look, you gotta talk to me.
You are in serious danger.
I got Sam here with me.
- We got to come in and talk to you.
- Get the hell out of here.
- I'm calling the police.
- Good.
- Tell her to do it.
- Fine. ThaÃ¹s what we want you to do.
We want you to call the police.
- But you've gotta let us in.
- No.
Look, don't you get it?
Sam was not just accidentally killed.
He was murdered.
He found out that Carl was laundering money at the bank.
Now, this guy Carl is dangerous.
I'm telling you, he tried to kill me.
He's gonna try to kill you, too.
You are in deep, deep trouble.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't. I just... I just can't.
Oda Mae, Oda Mae, tell her she's wearing the shirt that I spilled the margarita on and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.
Molly, Sam says to tell you you're wearing the shirt that he spilled the margarita on and the earrings he gave you for Christmas.
Don't you see?
I'm not a fake, not about this.
- Give me a penny, quick.
- What?
Push a penny under the door, now.
What you be talking about, push a penny under the door?
Just do it.
- Tell her iÃ¹s for luck.
- Sam says iÃ¹s for luck.
We're between Greene and Mercer on Prince.
We're between Greene and Mercer on Prince.
IÃ¹s the gray building right across from the post office.
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry.
We'll be waiting.
- All right. They're on their way.
- Good.
- So, what do we do now?
- Just wait.
Is Sam here?
Sam?
I'm sitting beside her.
He's sitting right beside you.
Sam, can you feel me?
With all my heart.
He says with all his heart.
I'd give anything if I could just touch you once more.
He says he wishes he was alive again, so he could touch you.
Me, too.
Okay. Okay, look. You can use me.
- Use you?
- You can use my body.
Use your body?
Just do it quick before I change my mind.
Molly?
Molly, are you home?
IÃ¹s Carl.
Molly!
Fire escape.
WhaÃ¹s happening to me?
Molly?
Molly?
Molly!
Son of a bitch.
Come on.
Molly, look. Look.
Oh, leÃ¹s go. LeÃ¹s go.
Molly!
Just get away from us, Carl.
- Molly!
- You're just a liar. Liar!
Molly, you got to listen to me.
This woman's a thief.
- She's a con artist.
- Why?
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't listen to her, Molly.
Stop!
Just get away from us, Carl.
I've called the police.
Molly!
Shit.
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- Don't interfere, Molly. She's a thief.
All right, the check.
Just give me the check.
- Carl, no.
- Stay out of this, Molly!
Son of a bitch!
Keep out of this, Molly!
Get off of me!
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it, God damn it!
- I gave it away.
- You're lying to me.
Don't lie to me, God damn it!
The check.
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to God, I'll kill her.
Just... Look, just give me the check,
Sam. Okay?
I promise you I'll let her go if you'll just give it to me.
Okay?
Sam?
Sam?
Sam.
- Oh, Carl.
- What?
No!
Are you two all right?
Sam?
Molly?
I can hear you.
Oh, God.
Sam? They're waiting for you, Sam.
I'll miss you.
Your mother'd be proud.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Sam.
You're all right.
Bye, Oda Mae.
Bye, Sam.
I love you, Molly.
I've always loved you.
Ditto.
IÃ¹s amazing, Molly.
The love inside, you take it with you.
See you.
See you.
Bye.

<font color='#FFFFFF'>HANK: Tough loss, George.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I can't take it anymore.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You have to start trade them.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>All of them, now!</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>That is not my fault.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What ever happened to Barney or</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Bailey, or whatever?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You fired him, and they </font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>She'll be here at 11:00.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah, angels. Real ones.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Wh-- Why do you think</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>there would be...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>real angels at the ball game?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Maybe 'cause I prayed for 'em?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Nothing you were doing was helping.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I just figured it couldn't hurt.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(CLEARS THROAT)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Does he talk?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Of course he talks.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He just doesn't like strangers.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, me either.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't even like my friends.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, these angels you thinkyou seen,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>do you suppose they're coming back?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- If they feel like it, I guess.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Oh, this is crazy.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I must be losing it.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What I meant to say is...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, do you wanna come</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to the game tomorrow?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I have an open seat</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>next to the dugout, and you can...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>get your Aunt Maggie or </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>whoever she is to come along.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I don't go to baseball games.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Oh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- But, uh, yeah, you can go, Roger.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Can J.P. come too?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Okay.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: After their </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>victory over the Jays...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the Angels open a three-game series</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>against the visiting Athletics.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Winning the last game may </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>have given these Angels a boost.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Sizing up the team, I'd say</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>they look a little bouncier today,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>wouldn't you, Wally?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(CLICK) Absolutely, Ranch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>As we saw in last game--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Keep it minimal, Wally.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>They'll like you better.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(CLICK)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: We're 20 minutes </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>away from game time,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and there are already</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>more people in the seats...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>than there were for</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the last five games combined.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Here. Here you go.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Take that. Just take it, okay?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>DAVID: Do you want anything else?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, yeah, peanuts, maybe,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and nachos, if you could.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Aah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Sorry.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- DAVID: My linen suit!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What do I do? Mustard stains.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That's hot water.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Cold water. Uh, club soda.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Club soda.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I got soda!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- DAVID: Ow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(GASPs)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm all wet.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>DAVID: Get up in front of me.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Right now! We're gonna dry off.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Leave your popcorn there.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Hey, what happened to you?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Those kids, they're evil.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>The big one might be lucky,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>so keep him happy.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- JP, let's go!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- We gonna win today, kid?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Maybe.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Maybe?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't know.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's your team.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Don't remind me.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>Oh, please, don't drink me.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>No, no, no, don't, don't, don't!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- AL: Aah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Got it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GARY: My, my!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- How'd you get-- How'd you get--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>AL: This is between you and me, </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>little guy. No one can see me but you.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Remember?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Oh, hi.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>AL: Sit down, already.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I left in a hurry yesterday.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I forgot a few of the rules.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Numero uno:</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>don't tell anyone about us.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Now, I heard you already told</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the little kid and el capitÂ¹n.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But nobody else.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We hate recognition.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We're a very sensitive group.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>If people know we're around,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I wouldn't be able to get an angel...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>within a mile of this team.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Okay. Uh, are you guys</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>gonna help out today?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We'll see.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We never make commitments.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We go and come and come and go.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We're a capricious crowd.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Wh-- What's cap--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What's-- What's capricious?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Just keep your chin up and your</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>eyes open and enjoy the game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Aah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (GASPS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You popped Al!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Who's Al?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Al's the boss angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- He was just here, but he's gone now.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Next time will you tell me sooner?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'd like to try and see one.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ROGER: Mr Knox, over here!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Over here! Over here, Mr Knox!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Mr Knox, Mr Knox, over here!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Mr Knox, come on,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>come on! Mr Knox!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I just saw an angel!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You saw an angel?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah. In my Coke cup.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- In your Coke cup?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Okay.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I gotta get back to the dugout.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What should I do</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>if I see another one?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Kid, I was thinking of you</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>as a sort of good luck charm...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>not as someone</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>who spiritually hallucinates.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What's that?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It means if you see anything</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>weird, keep it to yourself.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But wait! You should know.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You're the manager,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and the angels are here to help...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and if I don't tell you,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you're not gonna know--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Calm down.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>In baseball, we got signals.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Make some kind of signal.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Okay? I can't come over here</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>every couple of seconds.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Um, I'll go like that, okay?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Oh, okay. You do that.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That's fine. Okay.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And we-- </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And we can't let David know.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah, right. Absolutely.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We can't tell David.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Can't tell anyone.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Thank you.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Here.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Thanks.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Thanks. Oh, and excuse me, David,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>wh-- where are the nachos?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(CRUNCH)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm saving them for later.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(BOTH LAUGHING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Sorry!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Sorry!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(LAUGHING CONTINUES)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ANNOUNCER: Number 17,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>first baseman Tom Brewer.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Bass takes the sign.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Here's the pitch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And it's lined to left...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- for another base hit.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- AUBREY: Oh, no!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Shit! Damn!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- So it's more bad news...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Shit!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- for manager Knox...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>as he does his dance</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in the dugout.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Mapel waits for the pitch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Strike!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- GEORGE: Strike?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Aw, come on, now!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That's no strike!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>If that was a strike, th-th-th-then you</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>blind as a horse's ass!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(GASPS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: Jesus! Come on. </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Let me have some-- Gimme this.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Mr Knox.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I want your hats off.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>- It's nacho butt.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Go buy the kids nachos.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Anything but nachos.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Buy them Angels jackets.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- It's 90 degrees outside.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Get your butt up there, now!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (SIGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You know, uh,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>it's been four innings,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and no real angels yet.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And, you know, I was just thinking,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>maybe you shouldn't swear so much.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I bet the angels don't like it.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Sh-Shoot!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Get on, you stupid sons of--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm kiddin'!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Man, he is a deadbeat, this one.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Let's keep the profanity down!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Huh?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I mean it! No swearin'!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That eliminates all speech</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for most of the team.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: So here in the ninth,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the Athletics have opted</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to bring in reliever...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Tom Ruddy to pitch</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to Angels heavy hitter</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Ray Mitchell.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Oh-ho, wow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What happened?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>There's an angel</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>right next to Hemmerling.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, David, I-I need a drink.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You have drinks.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I don't want these.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I want something else.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What else?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, coffee.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You drink coffee?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah. Of course. All the time.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah, all the time.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What do you think we are,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>little kids or something?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Now, get me a cup or I'll scream.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>How do you take it?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>In cups.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ROGER: Mr Knox! Mr Knox!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Come over here. We got one!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hey.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What's goin' on?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- There's an angel with Hemmerling.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>There's an angel massaging</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hemmerling's shoulders.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(SIGHS) </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>This is ridiculous. I don't know</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>what you see,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but there's no one</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>with Hemmerling.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ROGER: She's rubbin' </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>his shoulders.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Huh?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- A-A-And what should I do about it?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Put him in.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Pinch-hit.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I-I got Mitchell coming up.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's my best hitter.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hemmerling can't hit</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the broad side of a barn.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I can't substitute my worst hitter</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for my best hitter.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>If you want a hit,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you'll put in Hemmerling.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's crazy! Wacko.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You forget about it. Ah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- But he's got an angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Wait a minute. What's the worst thing</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>that could happen?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Are we gonna fall</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>out of last place? Heh.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Sit down, Mitchell.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You're up, Hemmerling.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ALL: Huh?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What are you talkin' about?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah, what are you talking about?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You heard what I said.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You're out and you're in.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You gotta be stupid!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Hey, get your stuff!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Right.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (LAUGHING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Damn! Damn!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Aah! Aah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>As Mitchell was getting ready</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to lead off,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Knox has suddenly</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>decided to pinch-hit.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And he's bringing in Danny Hemmerling,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the utility infielder...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>who is known, sports fans, for his</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>glove, but definitely not for his bat.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hemmerling for Mitchell?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Go back to Cincinnati!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Strike!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (CROWD BOOING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Where they go?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Damn!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- UMPIRE: Strike!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: See the pitch?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>VERNE: Oh, my gosh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Holy cow! Are you kidding me?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What the--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (SINGING) For goodness sake</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Oh, wow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I got the hippy-hippy shakes</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah, I got the shakes</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I got the hippy-hippy shakes</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Ah, I can't stand still</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Go, go! Come on! Come on!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ALL: Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hey-Hey, uh--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah, I get my fill now</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- ALL: Aah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Whoa!</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>(ALL SHOUTING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Unhh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Go, go, go!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: He may score.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- UMPIRE: Throw it! Safe!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: He will score!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- BOTH: Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Hemmerling scores</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for the first time this season,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and the Angels win the game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>This will go down </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in the record books.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Ladies and gentlemen,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>this is unbelievable!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>This is insanity! I've never </font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>And, obviously, neither</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>have these umps.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't know. (WHISTLES)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ROGER: Yeah! </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah! All right! Whoo-hoo!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Something's going on</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>with this kid.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(PLAYERS CHEERING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Ladies and gentlemen, can we now say</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the Angels are on a winning streak?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Or were these last few games</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>just a small blip on the screen</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>of a terminally ill patient?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Only time will tell.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What is going on?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Where are my stats? I'm on the air!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- My ass is hanging on the air...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- No, it's not!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and there are no stats.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>There were how many errors?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- There were a lot of errors, Ranch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Not as many as in this booth.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Let me tell you, this is not baseball.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>This is not baseball.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Ow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Hey, David!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Whatever your duties were before,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>forget 'em.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>From now on, these boys</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>will be at all our games.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>Mr Knox, I want to remind you, you are</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>gonna fire me on Friday, aren't you?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You've bonded with the boys.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Bonded?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Hey, you're gonna stick around, David.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah, stick around, David.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Hey, you got job security.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Job security?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (SHUTS DOOR)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Who knew?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>So, you're right.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hemmerling came through.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah, 'cause of the angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Aw, whatever.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- No, we got angels helping the team.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Ah, well, that may be,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but we're winning.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>All the games, man!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Can you believe it?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: When we're on the road,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you should watch the games on TV.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We'll figure out a way</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for us to talk on the phone.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You mean, the phone in the dugout</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you're always yelling into...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and-and banging against</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the wall and spitting at?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah, yeah, yeah, that phone.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Cool! (LAUGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What a game. First time Hemmerling</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>got a hit, let alone a home run.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's 'cause of the angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>They helped him.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Get in.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Come on.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We don't have all day.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>ROGER: Sort of.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He used to live</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in a car with his mom.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm happy you see the angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Me too.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>JP: Good night.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: It's a beautiful day</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>here in Anaheim...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>as the resurgent Angels</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>prepare to meet their longtime</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>nemesis, the Detroit Tigers...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>who have won the first five games</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>of their Western road trip.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>WALLY: They've been the hottest team in the</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>league for the last few weeks, Ranch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder:</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the most popular--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>...coming up next week</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>with Cap Night...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>this year featuring a totally white cap</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>with red pinstripes and the Angel logo.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's free for the first 50, 000 fans</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>entering Anaheim Stadium.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I see an angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Already?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I gotta go bathroom. I can't go alone.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Bad guys might get me.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We just came back</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>from the bathroom.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Gotta go now. Sorry.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Gimme your Coke.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Gimme the Cracker Jacks.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Stand up.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>DAVID: Go.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What's-- What's up?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- We got an angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But the game hasn't started.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>She was with Mel Clark.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Aah! Impossible.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>She was there. That means Mel</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>should start the game today.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Mel's arm is gone.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I don't care. He should start the game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh-uh. No way! And besides,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>he's not even on the active roster.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>If the angel pitches with him,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>he'll be awesome.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You really do see something,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>don't you?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah, I do.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Good. All right.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You're off injured reserve</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and you're starting today.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You talkin' to me?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>So get your stuff together.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Starting pitcher announced</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for this game was Dan Prince...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but just moments ago,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the Angels made a dramatic change...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and activated the </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>long-injured Mel Clark.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>League rules specify that up</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>until the first pitch is thrown,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the roster can be altered...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>although I can't ever remember</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>this happening so near game time.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Me neither, Ranch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Easy, Wally. Less is more.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>These warm-ups</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>should be interesting.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Over the plate, Mel!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- WALLY: Clark looks a little rusty.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- MEL: Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Too much time</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in the whirlpool, Wally.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm checking to see if Dan Prince</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>pulled a muscle during his warm-up.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>There must be some logical explanation</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>as to why George Knox...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>would make such a bizarre change.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I have personally checked</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the stats, sports fans...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and Mel Clark hasn't started a game...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>In this decade.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>WALLY: He looks mighty</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'> nervous out there.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Not as nervous </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>as George Knox.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Clark takes the sign.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Talk about heat!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Messmer felt that one.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Ow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Oh, my gosh! Holy cow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Wow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Are you kidding me?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What an amazing pitch!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You damn-- darn right.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(LAUGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Well, commit that</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to memory, Wally...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>'cause he doesn't have</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>any more of those in him.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- An angel helped out on that one.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Good.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- MEL: Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Got it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Strike!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- MEL: Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- BRENT: Got it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Strike!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (CHEERING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Mel!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Way to go!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>All right, Mel!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Unh! Unh! Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Unh! Unh! Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>BRAD: Got it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's now the top of the ninth. There</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>are two outs. We've got a full count.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>This could be the Tigers' last</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>chance to get back...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- in this ball game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- One more! One more!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Got it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- ROGER: Yeah! Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I told you!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I told you!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: That's the game! The Angels win</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>one-nothing in a miracle shutout...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>pitched by the veteran Mel Clark.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(PLAYERS CHEERING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- All right, Mel! - Good game!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah! Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's unbelievable.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>How in the world did</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>old noodle-arm pull that off?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And who gets the credit?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>George Knox. George Knox.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And we're down in the Angels' clubhouse</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for a talk with manager George Knox.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What inspired you to start Mel?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- A feeling.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>An instinct. A kind of faith.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>A faith in what? Has Mel shown</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>this kind of power in practice?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Mel Clark has always shown himself</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to be an extraordinary athlete.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>The rest is about believing</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in something or someone.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And when did you suddenly start</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>believing in Clark?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's been sitting on</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the bench all season.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I look for signs.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- It's good to win.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: And sometimes they come</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>from unexpected places.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Look, that's enough out of me for today.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Talk to the star of the game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Excuse me.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Something's goin' on.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Mel! You talk to us about the game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Well, it-- it feels great</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to be a winner again.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- We won! - (CHUCKLES)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah. Three in a row.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Oh, I feel good!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah. Me too.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Me three.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Ah, I owe you guys.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: Okay. Anything you want.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You name it, you got it.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(JAZZ PLAYING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- All right, let's play ball!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- BOYS: Yeah!</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Marvin Vincent Archer.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You play any ball before, Marvin?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>No, I never played any ball.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Well, this is a perfect time to learn.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Come on.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- GEORGE: Watch the ball...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- ROGER: Stay sharp, Zack.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and when I say "now," you swing.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: Just do exactly what I say.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Get ready to swing.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: The Angels have closed out the </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>season with an incredible hot streak.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Who would have believed they could go</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>from last place at the All-Star break...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to just one win away</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>from clinching the division title?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Now it all comes down</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to the last two games of the season...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and, ironically, they are with the</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>defending champion Chicago White Sox...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>who are one game back</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and closing fast...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in a determined effort</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>The first ofthose crucial games</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>I've just tried everything to get 'em</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to reschedule. It's just not possible.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Maggie, I'm not going.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You don't have a choice,</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'll call Mr Knox.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I know he thinks you guys</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>Come on. You're getting snot all over</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the place. It's nobody's fault.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I tried to see angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I really tried.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I guess without angels helping,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>this team doesn't have what it takes.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Maybe I just don't</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>have what it takes.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>JP: If we could still win </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>without the angels. It could happen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Maybe. Eh, gimme a minute, kid,</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>I know who you are.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I heard you on the radio.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>have a big chin.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Everybody's a critic.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Well, what's your name?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- JP.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Well, J.P., that was</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>a tough loss today, huh?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Knox took it pretty hard.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He was gettin' kinda crazy out there.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>'Cause Roger couldn't come.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I get it. So Roger's sort of lucky.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Is that it?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He sees the angels, the ones</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>who help out. He prayed for 'em.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Real angels?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah, but I don't see 'em.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And Knox-- he sees 'em?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>No!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Roger has to tell him</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>when they're around.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Really?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>MAGGIE: You know,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>by releasing you legally...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>it does make it possible for somebody</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to take you permanently.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He did that 'cause he wants</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the best for you.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah. Givin' someone away is</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>a great way to show 'em you care.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Hey, Roger!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Took a little longer than you expected.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We waited three hours for his hearing.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That's quick for family court.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- What'd they decide?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Oh, it's just a formality.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(CLOSES DOOR)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He belongs to the state</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>of California now.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Scoot over.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Roger, I'm sorry about today.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Why? 'Cause you lost</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>your stupid baseball game?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>No. Because you're hurt.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(SCOFFS) You don't </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>know anything about it.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You know, Roger, when I was growin' up,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I never saw very much of my dad.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: He couldn't </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>take care of himself...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>so takin' care of me and my brothers</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>was outta the question.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm not sure the pain</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>that caused ever goes away.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But I am sure you can't</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>go through life...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>thinkin' everyone you meet</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>will one day let you down.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Because if you do,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>a very bad thing will happen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You'll end up like me.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm goin' inside.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I thought you said you</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>had to be somewhere.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I do. Right here.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yuck!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You both wash your hands?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yep.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Okay, then, let's dig in.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: Next time I'll try lasagna.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You guys like lasagna?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>BOTH: No. What is it?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>JP: Look. It's God's thumbnail.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That's just the moon, JP.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>No God up there.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>I can't believe you said that.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>The kid who sees angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't believe </font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>JP: Roger, what are </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you talking about?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That's okay, JP.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Roger's had a tough day.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(ROGER SIGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>"The source says there's</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>a boy known as Roger--</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>"And when Mel Clark made his</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>amazing comeback in August...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>it was Roger's--</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Who do you think told?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't know. Maybe David found out.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't see how.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- JP: Are we in trouble?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Knox is in trouble, that's for sure.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>This is bad, right?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm gonna have to tell Maggie.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(JP SIGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>WOMAN: Right this </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>way, Mr Knox.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You stood me up last night.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>HANK: What in the Sam Hill is</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>all this about real angels?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- It's nothing.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Start talkin'.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Okay. I-- I got these two kids.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And I-I think of them as mascots.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And the angels-- Uh, well--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's just something that's</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>going on between me and them.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>HANK: You're tellin' me there's</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>real angels in the ball park?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Sometimes.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But they're not in on all the plays.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(CHUCKLES)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You've lost it, partner.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Look, if I lied to you...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>then the angels wouldn't like it,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and they might not come back.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>They're very temperamental.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Mental is the key word here.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm sorry, George, but I'm relieving you</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ofyour management responsibilities.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You can't do that.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We're only one game away.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I tell you what. I'll give you 24 hours</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to get your head on straight.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Then I'll call a press conference.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And you can publicly</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>renounce this hogwash.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>HANK: George, you repeat any of</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the baloney I've heard here...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>we're talkin' the end of</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>HANK: Have I made myself clear?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yes.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We're gonna make this short and sweet.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>My manager, George Knox here,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>has something he'd like to say to ya.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- George.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- I have a statement I'd like to read.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>There have been reports...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>that I've been using angels</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to help the team win.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>MAGGIE: Go on. Go in.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(ALL CLAMORING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I was gonna read a statement...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but instead,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm gonna shoot from the hip.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You know, there are</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>a lot of times in sports...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>when there's no logical explanation</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>why things happen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: Sometimes a </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>player gets hot and...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>goes beyond their physical ability.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Is it just adrenaline?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't know.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But I do believe</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>there are times in life...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>where something stronger, higher...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>or maybe spiritual is with us.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: I can't explain it, but something has</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>happened to my players this year...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>something that's changed</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the way they play...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and the way I manage.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You can call it faith.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You can call it angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You can call it whateveryou want.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That's all I have to say.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: George, does this mean</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you really think...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>that a kid sees angels</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>at your games?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(CLEARS THROAT)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Excuse me.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'd, uh-- I'd like to say something</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>on behalf of George Knox.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, what's your name?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>What's your business here?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>My name is Maggie Nelson.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I take care of foster kids.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>MAGGIE: One of these boys is, uh,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the child who can see angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He could stand up right now</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and tell you exactly what's happened...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and I know you'd just laugh at him.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But, when a professional football player</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>drops to one knee to thank God...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>after making a touchdown,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>nobody laughs at that.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Or when a pitcher crosses himself</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>before going to the mound?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Nobody laughs at that either.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Seems like you're saying</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>it's okay to believe in God...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but it's not okay</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to believe in angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Uh, I thought they were</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>on the same team.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Is it your belief, ma'am,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>that, uh, angels play baseball?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Since the All-Star break, yes.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(ALL LAUGHING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We all need somebody</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to watch out for us.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Every kid I have</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ever taken care of...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>has been looking for</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>someone to love-- an angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You gotta have faith.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>MAGGIE: You gotta believe.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You gotta look inside yourself.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>The footprints</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>of an angel are love.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And where there is love,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>miraculous things can happen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I've seen it.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'd also like</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to say something.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>MEL: I don't know if there</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>are angels out there...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>other than the 25 of us</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in uniform...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but I know there is</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>one thing I won't do.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I won't play for anyone</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but George Knox. I believe in him.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That goes for me too.</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah! Yes!</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>and welcome to downtown Anaheim...</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>out against</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: When I came here this season,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I didn't believe in you guys.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I didn't believe in anything.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But when you stood up this morning...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you gave me back</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>my reason to believe.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I'm more proud of bein' a part of</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>So let's go out there</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and show them what winners can do!</font>

<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah! Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- All right! You're so fantastic!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- MEL: Okay, you heard him. Let's go!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>your California Angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(ALL CHEERING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Starting pitcher</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for this crucial game...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>is the veteran Mel Clark.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- All right!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's been their hottest pitcher since</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>he returned to the line-up in July.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: So, Clark's have a rocky</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>start here in the first.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's got runner's a second and third</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>with two outs, </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And Darren at bat.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Darren tries the ball to left.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's fair!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>One run will score, and</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>here comes Cooper.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Norton get's to it.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's gonna be close.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Here come the ball...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Copper slides, he's safe!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- AUBREY: No!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: The fans don't like the call.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But the Sox go up 2 to nothing,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And we're still in the top in the verse.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- You got 'em, Mel!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- (SIGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Clark pitches to Young.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He loops one over second base</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and here comes Garcia!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Oh, wow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- RANCH: Whoa! Garcia makes a...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>spectacular save</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to end the inning!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah! Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: With the Angels </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>behind 2 to nothing...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Clark's really struggling with</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>one out in the top of the fifth...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And a man on first and second</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Beasley comes to bat.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Anybody got any uh-No?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: No question he's tiring, Wally.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And Knox knows it. Ball one.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That expected this there</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>getting Teller up now...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>In the ballpen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Whoa! Mitchell makes a great</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>play makes the force at third.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: All right, all right, all right</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>all right, all right.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>All right.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Here in the sixth...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Garcia's on first with the</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>single as the Angels trying...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>To battle away back</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>into the ball game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That brings up Ray Mitchell.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Ray's been hot as wild far</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>this second half of this...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- miraculous season.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- But as many you've known...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>In the past, Mitchell is choked.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>When it came from</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>real pressure situation.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(SHOUTING) You got the one, Ray?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>GEORGE: You hear me?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You can do it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Mitchell connects...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's hit deep...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Go, go, go, go, go!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- And It's gone!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Got it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- AUBREY: Oh, my god!! I got it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- RANCH: Ray Mitchell has just hit...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>a monster home run with the man on</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to tie the game here in the sixth.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>VERNE: Oh, my gosh! Holy cow.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Are you kidding me?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(ALL CHEERING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Clark has it's back to</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the wall here in the seventh...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>As the Sox was threading again</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>with two man on base.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Okay. Holding on, holding on.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Holding on. Huh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hang it in there.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Clark definitely could use an angel now,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>as he's tiring...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>late in the game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>BRENT: Intercepted!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah! Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>WALLY: There seems to be some sort</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>of magic in the way his team</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>is supporting him, Ranch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Hey, kid. How you doin'?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Fine. Al!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hey, kiddo, sharp outfit.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I wish I had one.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Thanks. Gee, I am </font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>glad to see you.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You know, I was afraid you guys</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>wouldn't show up today since...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>you know, a lot of people</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>know about the angels now.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>No one's coming. Championships have</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to be won on their own. It's a rule.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Oh. Well, then,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>what are you doing here?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I came here to check on Mel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's comin' up soon.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- He's gonna be one of us.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Y-You mean he's--</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Ah, he smoked for  years.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's always a mistake.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>AL: He's got six months left.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He doesn't know anything's wrong yet.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- No.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Don't you worry.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's well taken care of.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>You concentrate on your own life now.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We expect great things from you, kid.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We'll all be watching.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Remember that. Even though you can't</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>see us, we're always watching.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(SIGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: With the man on and</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>one out in the eighth.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Clark is showing definite</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>science of photic.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>As he pitches to Marge.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Ball three.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Take your time, Clark.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>BOY: We're ready to go, guys!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Here's the pitch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And Marge grounds to Martinez</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>they get Darren in second.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Garcia throws, Double play!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- AUBREY: Yes!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- And once again sulled defense...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>barrels Clark out of the jam!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: It's still tied up here</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in the bottom of the eighth.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>but the Angels have Garcia at bat</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and Martinez on third...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>with the go ahead run.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Martinez goes on the pitch!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Garcia bunts!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>There's a screen's play.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Here's the throw.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- VERNE: Oh, wow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Martinez scores!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And the Angels take the lead!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Yeah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Unh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Messmer pops out to</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Gaboyan to end the inning.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>So as were in the ninth</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the Angels are only three outs</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>away from the pennant...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>if they can just hold on</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to this 3 to 2 lead.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Hey, Mel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Let's finish this.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- We got 'em.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>All right. All right,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>three outs, boys.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Let's do it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: So the championship</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>on the line...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>manager George Knox elects</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to send a tired Mel Clark...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>out to face the heart of</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the White Sox's lineup.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(SCOFFS) He's all alone.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Let's go.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Come on, Angels.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Don't worry. He'll get an angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Mel always gets an angel.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Clark takes the sign</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for his first pitch to Gasper.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Let's see if he has</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>anything left.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Gasper gets a piece of it.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And it balls in</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for the single.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>The tying run is</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>now on first.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: They're getting Sanford</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>up in the bullpen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(COUGHING)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Bee, bunt!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Clark feels it cleanly</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and gets the runner at first.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>But Gasper advances at second</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>on the sarifice.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>One down.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>The White Sox now have</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the tying run and scoring...</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>position with Darren at bat.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>It's in the hole.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Garcia dives.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- He gets it!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- AUBREY: Yes!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>The grow is off-balance.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Safe!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Not in time!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Are you sure?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: But the go</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ahead run is now on first.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>With only one away.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: Clark looks very tired.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Gaboyan swings and smashes it</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>deep left center!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>This is trouble! Williams</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>got a good jump on the ball!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Somebody better take charge!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>VERNE: Oh, wow!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: And Ben Williams saves the game</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>for now with a spectacular catch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>WALLY: Had a great throw,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>to hold the runner at third.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Aah!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Oh!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And he hits Birch</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in the back on the first pitch.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>That loads the bases.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and Kesey, the lead guard</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>beyond leader is up next.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>ANNOUNCER: Number 32,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Kit "Hit or Die" Kesey.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(SPITS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(SPITS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: I can't believe</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>he's leaving Clark in the game.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Any hit scores a run.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- There's an angel there now, right?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- No.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And the runners take their leads.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And Kesey got a good piece</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>of that one, but it's foul.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>We've got one strike.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Sanford is ready</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>in the bullpen.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Ball one!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>WALLY: His arm has to be tired.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's thrown 156 pitches.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- Ball two!</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>- There's one comin', right, Roger?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I don't know, JP.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>I-- I don't think so.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>And Clark just misses nicking Kesey,</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>and the count goes to 3 and 1.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>He's way behind</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>the batter now.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>(GEORGE SIGHS)</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>Any angels?</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>No.</font>
<font color='#FFFFFF'>RANCH: And Kesey jumps on it!</font>

Snuggle in, sweetie! It's cold out there.
Why is it snowing, Grandma?
Where does it come from?
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.
- I wanna hear.
- Not tonight. Go to sleep.
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.
Well, all right.
Let's see...
I guess it would have to start with scissors!
Scissors?
Well, there are all kinds of scissors.
And once there was even a man who had scissors for hands.
- A man?
- Yes.
- Hands scissors?
- No, scissor hands.
You know the mansion on top of the mountain?
It's haunted.
Well...
A long time ago an inventor lived in that mansion.
He made many things, I suppose.
He also created a man.
He gave him insides,
a heart, a brain, everything.
Well, almost everything.
You see, the inventor was very old.
He died before he got to finish
the man he invented.
So the man was left by himself,
incomplete and all alone.
He didn't have a name?
Of course he had a name.
His name was Edward.
Avon calling!
- Weren't you just here?
- No, not since last season!
Today I've come to show you our exquisite new line of softer colours, in shadows, blushes and lipstick.
Everything you need to accent and highlight your changing look.
My changing look. That's good!
I also have a complete selection of your old favourites, those tried and true products we've all come to depend on year in and year out.
Come on, Peg,
I never buy anything from you.
I know. Bye, Helen.
You didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself.
I could? I don't think so.
It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.
See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...
And out she pops.
On TV they say you repairmen are a lonely bunch.
Housewives get lonely too, though you may not realise it since they haven't made an ad.
And then you just take this and put it back in here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.
And then you just screw this back on.
Now who could that be?
Will you excuse me for a moment?
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
This is fascinatin'!
I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!
- Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling!
- Why, Peg...
Have you gone blind?
Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?
- Yes.
- Don't you realise that means I'm busy?
OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.
OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini, which looked charming on you, or the Bahimini Bliss?
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?
Ding-dong! The Avon lady!
Just not my day.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, it's so beautiful!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Avon calling!
Oh, my!
Hello?
I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative.
I'm sorry to barge in like this, but you don't have any reason to be afraid.
This is some huge house, isn't it?
Thank goodness for those aerobics classes.
Hello?
Why are you hiding back there?
You don't have to hide from me.
I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative, and I'm as harmless as cherry pie...
Oh, my!
I can see that I've disturbed you.
How stupid of me. I'll just be going now.
Don't go.
Oh, my!
What happened to you?
I'm not finished.
Put those down.
Don't come any closer. Please...
Those are your hands?
What happened to you?
Where are your parents?
Your mother?
Your father?
He didn't wake up.
Are you alone?
Do you live up here all by yourself?
What happened to your face?
I won't hurt you.
At the very least, let me give you a good astringent.
This will help to prevent infection.
What's your name?
Edward.
I think you should just come home with me.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.
You go ahead and look.
You have every reason to be excited.
You OK?
Hello?
Hi. It's Marge.
I was standing outside talking to Carol, and
Peg drove by. She had somebody with her.
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.
Did she say anything to you about having a guest?
Nothing at all.
She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn.
No... OK, I'll meet you on the corner.
Right. Bye.
Damn!
Here we go, dear. This is our house.
You can just go right in and make yourself right at home, OK?
We'll have something to eat or drink, or...
Here, dear. Here we go. This is the front door.
Right in here.
Joyce? I just saw this strange guy drive in with Peg. I didn't get a good look.
He looked kinda pale.
On my way. Don't do anything without me.
Yes! Be right there!
Here we are.
So... this is the living room and back here are the bedrooms.
You want to see the pictures? All right.
This is my husband Bill.
He's a bowling champion.
Do you know what bowling is?
Bowling?
No. Well... Here they are down at the lake, fishing.
I think Kevin looks a little glum because they didn't catch anything that day.
And here's my daughter Kim.
All dressed for the junior prom.
She's a senior now, if you can believe it!
She's camping in the mountains with friends, but she'll be back in a few days.
You can meet then.
Isn't she beautiful?
That's my family.
Come along.
I'll show you the rest of the house.
Then you can just freshen up and make yourself at home.
That's the kitchen over there.
Help yourself to anything you want.
Those are grapes.
And back here are the bedrooms.
Let me get you some towels and I'll see what we can find for you to wear.
You know what? I think I have some of
Bill's old clothes in here. This is perfect!
Here. These should just fit you.
Don't be alarmed. That's just the phone.
Now you can go in Kim's room and put these on, and I'll be right with you.
No, no, scissors!
That's right. Well, he was born up there or... something.
- Have you seen him before?
- No, I doubt he's ever been off the grounds.
Then how did you ever get together with him?
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.
Sorry, Edward, I didn't...
May I help you with this?
Thank you.
There you go. Oh dear, you've cut your face.
Let me just get this right off.
- Does that hurt?
- No.
Good. OK. Now, let's get you dressed.
There we go. Very fine!
You look fine!
Helen, come on! She wouldn't wait for you.
I've got rollers in my damn hair!
Now, what did I do with my sciss...?
Edward, would you?
Thank you.
You know, I have a doctor friend who I think could help you.
- Really?
- Yes.
Now, I can help with the scars...
But I just wanna consult the big
Avon handbook before doing anything.
Kevin!
It's not polite to stare, dear.
Think how it would make you feel if somebody were staring at you.
- I wouldn't care.
- Well, I would, so don't do it!
This must be quite a change for you, right, Ed?
- Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward.
- Sure.
So what have you been doin' with yourself up there in that big old place?
- I bet the view must be spectacular, huh, Ed?
- Edward!
Yes?
No, I just...
See all the way to the ocean, I bet.
Sometimes.
Bill, could I have the salt and pepper, please?
Bill, dear, could I have the salt and pepper, please? Thank you.
Man, those things are cool!
I bet they're razor-sharp.
One karate chop to a guy's neck...
Kevin...!
Edward, would you like some butter for your bread?
Great!
Thank you.
Hey, can I bring him to show and tell on Monday?
Kevin, I've had enough.
Do you think you can sleep?
I know things feel strange, but soon you'll feel right at home.
Good night.
The light concealing cream goes on first, then you blend and blend and blend.
Blending is the secret.
More concealing cream...
Your complexion is so fair!
Now, this has a touch of lavender in it.
Give it a try here.
Close enough!
OK, this should do the trick here.
I have another idea.
We'll cover up the scars and start with a completely smooth surface.
Darn this stuff!
They still have 11 on the scoreboard,
and it's three to one.
It's through the gap to Warren.
Now they change it to 12 hits.
Turn it up, Kevin, I can't hear it!
Kevin!
- It's hammered!
- Did you hear that, Mr Boggs?
- No, make it louder!
- It's gone,
it's out of here, it's history!
Dad...
Look!
... to make it a five-run inning
and blow this game to pieces!
I'll be darned.
They filled the whole tape!
What's going on over there, Peg? Call me.
Hi, it's Marge. Who is he? Call me.
Oh, by the way, I hear it's pouring rain in
the mountains. Do you think the kids are OK?
Hey there, darlin'! The gals are all in a tizzy
about your secret visitor.
You can't keep him a secret for ever!
Well, it's just wonderful, Ed. My God, you have the whole family in there, don't ya?
And he answers the challenge at first
with a strike of his own.
Edward, come here.
No, that's a terrible idea, son!
Go to the garage and get the oil can.
We don't want him rusting up on us.
Edward, you did us!
- Oh, Bill, it's us!
- Yes, it is.
It's not heaven he's from, it's straight from the stinking flames of hell.
The power of Satan is in him, I can feel it.
- Can't you? Have you sheep strayed so far?
- We're not sheep.
Don't come near me.
That's right. Go on, get outta here, run!
Edward, don't you listen to her!
Don't worry about her, Edward.
She's just a little loony, that's all.
Hi!
You-all are hidin' in there like hermit crabs.
Hi, Joyce.
Shame on you, keepin' your unusual guest to yourself.
We think that's mighty selfish of you.
Things have been hectic here.
That is so sweet of you to wanna correct the situation.
What time does the barbecue begin?
Barbecue?
You intend to introduce your guest to your friends,
- don't you?
- I'll bring coleslaw.
And I will bring the ambrosia salad!
What time was it that you said?
- Bill!
- About five?
He has been sent first to tempt you!
But it's not too late.
You must push him from you, expel him.
Trample down the perversion of nature.
Did you hear that?
He's a perversion of nature.
Why, isn't that excitin'?
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks so much.
Bill!
You really can't have a picnic or a barbecue without devilled eggs.
They're just the best. They make a thing.
Oh, Edward, that's wonderful!
I didn't know you'd chopped the whole thing.
All right now, it's just a nick.
There's no need to be nervous, dear.
Esmeralda won't be here. And the rest of the neighbours, they're really very nice.
There's no need to be nervous.
They're so eager to meet you!
You just have to be yourself.
- Myself?
- That's right. Just your own sweet self.
- Thanks, Edward.
- Hey! Play scissors, paper, stone with us.
Play scissors what?
I got a doctor friend might be able to help you.
- He did them just like that!
- That is incredible.
- Hi, Mike, how you doin'?
- Hello, Jack.
Hey, kids!
Hi, George Monroe. That's a heck of a handshake you got there, Ed.
Harry! I saw you on the golf course last week...
Are you OK? Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?
Do you want a cracker?
- He's different.
- Completely different.
No kidding.
- He's so...
- Mysterious.
D'you imagine those hands are hot or cold?
And just think what a single snip could do.
Or undo.
Eddie.
The guys and I want to invite you to our card game Friday night.
Would you like that?
Only thing is... you can't cut!
I have my own infirmity.
Never did me a bit of harm.
Took some shrapnel during the war, and ever since then I can't feel a damn thing!
Don't you ever let anybody tell you you have a handicap.
Who's handicapped? My goodness.
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not handicapped, you're...
What do they call the... exceptional?
My name's Joyce, and I noticed that you have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad that I made especially for you.
Allow me.
- You must try this. It's my mother's recipe.
- Doesn't this look gorgeous?
With a green thumb like yours,
I sure could use your help at my place.
I want a row of angels!
I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised to come to my house first. Haven't you, Eddie?
- I did?
- OK, everybody, grab your plates!
Soup's on!
What?
It is shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.
You shouldn't take things so literally.
"Let us pretend we are in the drawing
room and the hostess is serving tea."
"Many numerous little questions confront us."
"Should the man rise when he accepts his cup of tea?"
"May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?"
No.
"Is it good form to accept a second cup?"
"Should the napkin be entirely unfolded, or should the centre crease be allowed to remain?"
"It is so easy to commit embarrassing blunders, but etiquette tells us just what is expected of us and guards us from all humiliation and discomfort."
Yes. Boring.
Let us switch to...
To some poetry, hm?
"There was an old man from the Cape,"
"Who made himself garments of crepe."
"When asked: Will they tear?"
"He replied: Here and there,"
"But they keep such a beautiful shape!"
That's right.
Go ahead, smile. It's funny.
We're home.
Shit.
Everything's still sopping.
- I can hardly wait to take a shower.
- And to sleep in a bed.
If my parents have the alarm set,
I'm screwed.
I told you to call them and tell them we're coming back early.
- But did you?
- Nope, he'd rather complain.
How else am I supposed to get attention?
- You didn't call your parents.
- They don't run things like a police state.
Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny.
Bye.
- Don't forget your arm!
- Oh, yeah.
Come on, Jim, let's go.
There's somebody in my room! Go look!
He's a murderer! He's got an axe!
He tried to kill me!
Everything's OK.
Go back to bed, Kevin.
This way.
Edward's come to live with us.
There is nothing to be upset about.
We'll have you set up here in a minute.
We got a full queen-size bed here, believe it or not.
It's all made and everything. Good.
There you go.
What's the matter? What's wrong?
She get you nervous?
You've been cloistered away up in that castle too long.
You don't know about the wonderful world of teenage girls. They're all crazy.
- Here, this'll straighten you right out.
- What is it?
Lemonade.
I don't know what it is.
They reach a certain age...
They develop these gland things, their bodies swell up...
They go crazy.
Glands?
Yeah, glands.
I try not to think about it.
Good, isn't it?
Now, you stay in Kevin's room tonight and tomorrow we'll fix your room right up.
Why did you have to bring him here?
I couldn't have left him all alone.
You'd have done the same.
Why does he have to stay here?
My goodness, Kim, I'm surprised at you.
He can't help the way he is.
- Have a little sympathy.
- I do have sympathy.
Then say a little greeting.
Come downstairs, shake the man's hand...
- Shake his hand?!
- Well, not literally.
- Goodness, you scared him half to death!
- I scared him to death?
Hi, Bill! I just wanted you two to have a proper introduction.
Edward, this is our daughter Kim.
Kim, this is Edward, who's gonna live with us.
Hi.
Eddie!
Thirsty?
Kisses! Hush up!
Quiet now!
Darlin', I can hardly hear myself think!
Momma's precious little baby girl...
Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of lemonade?
Lemonade?
One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.
Sharpest things in the world.
They can hack through anything.
And...
They give me the creeps.
You should see the clown in Miss Peters' yard.
Kim!
- Oh, no.
- That's him?
- He's calling you, Kimba.
- Stop it!
Edward, you forgot your cookies.
Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for ya!
- Stop!
- Let's go.
Bill, Edward had lunch at Jackie's today and she just had her kitchen completely redone.
- I'll be darned.
- New paint, new cabinets, new floors,
- a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...
- Isn't that wonderful?
Jim, didn't you just tell me your mom had her kitchen done too?
Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new toys.
Big-screen TV, CD players,
VCR with four heads...
My goodness sake!
I wonder what it's like to be that rich.
They keep things locked up.
My father has his own room for his stuff to make sure I can't use it.
He won't even help me buy an old car.
He probably wants you to pay for it yourself.
It builds character. You'll appreciate it more.
Dad...!
Speaking of money... I understand you're not charging for your gardening, Edward.
Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.
Sweetheart...
You can't buy the necessities of life with cookies.
You can't buy a car with cookies.
Am I right, Jim?
That's true, sir, you can't.
I can't eat that. He used his hands.
I don't think it's sanitary.
I'm sorry.
Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?
No, that's OK.
I'll be right back.
Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!
She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!
She's gorgeous. Thank you!
It won't be long.
She just has to decide on the style.
And then it'll be fine.
I was hopin' for somethin' big and kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?
Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonna be just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.
Yes, you are.
Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?
You take my very breath away, I swear.
Look at this!
Have you ever cut a woman's hair?
Would you cut mine?
That was the single most thrillin' experience of my whole life.
They're getting the head of the company!
- I'm home!
- Hi, honey. We're in here.
Hi.
What did you do to your hair?
Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?
Hello? Oh, I can't believe
I'm talking to you in person.
This is such an honour.
Yes. He's right here.
So then you know all about it.
Well, that's exactly what I've been using.
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it the right consistency... well, just a little.
I'll try that.
Well, what imaginative suggestions.
I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.
No wonder she's the head of the company.
You know, she started out as a sales representative just like me.
I've always wanted to talk to her, but until now I never had a reason.
Thanks, Edward.
- She had some ideas?
- You bet she did.
I'll get that.
Edward. We're here.
Come on, let's get you sharpened up.
- You got it?
- No. I can't believe this.
This is such a drag.
Hi!
Bye.
Do you have a key?
No.
- I could have sworn they were in my purse.
- Well, we're stranded.
Wow! Thanks!
Ed! What a guy! Good job.
You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.
Be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in.
Quite a story, yes?
Any questions for Edward?
Yeah? Get away over.
Stand right up.
What's been the best part of your new life here in town?
The friends I've made.
Any other questions?
Have you ever thought of having corrective surgery or prosthetics?
I know a doctor that might be able to help you.
I'd like to meet him.
We'll get that name after the show.
Thank you. That's very nice.
Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.
But then you'd be like everyone else.
Yes, I know.
I think he'd like that.
But then no one would think you were special.
You wouldn't be on TV or anything.
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.
Your work is so interesting, distinctive and unique.
Do you have any plans to open your own beauty salon?
Oh, there's an idea!
Anyone else? Yeah. Stand right up.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Sure he does. Right, Kim?
- Right, Kim?
- Great! Now you got him started.
Knock it off, bubble-butt.
- You did it.
- So?
How about it, Edward?
Is there some special lady in your life?
Everything's all right. We'll take a break and we'll be back after these messages.
Why are you laughing? He got hurt!
- It was just a little shock. What do you care?
- A little shock?!
I wish we'd been taping that.
I'd give my left nut to see that again.
Aren't you excited? This is so thrillin'!
Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect.
It's just what we've been lookin' for.
I wanna call it Shear Heaven!
And here we are.
Now, all along here
I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.
And back along here, well, I think...
Eddie! Come along, doll.
Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.
And all along this row here...
- Peg could sell cosmetics.
- Yeah... Sure.
And this of course is where we wash the hair.
And here is where I stand... when I greet the customers.
But back in here is what I really wanna show you.
Eddie... This is what
I really want to show you.
Now, this is the storeroom where we keep everything, and what I need from you today is a decision I need you to help me make.
Honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.
Now, you just sit right down there...
I have some smocks.
Would you like me to model them for you?
Yes.
OK.
Now, this is my favourite.
Because it's yellow...
And what it's for... is to catch those itchy little trimmings that fall down your neck.
And then there's this old purple one that you kinda drape around you like this.
I like that one.
Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.
So am I!
I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.
Edward!
Edward, you come back here!
You can't do that!
Velcro, sweetheart.
- It hangs on the dashboard.
- I've never seen that.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Edward.
Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.
There you go.
So, Edward, did you have a productive day?
Mrs Monroe showed me where the salon will be.
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?
Great.
Then she showed me the back room where she took all her clothes off.
Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm as pleased as punch.
This venture's gonna teach you volumes.
There's nothin' like running your own business.
I've never done it myself, but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a working man can have.
So I guess the bank's gonna be your next step, huh?
The bank?
Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.
Nothin' to worry about. With your talent and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.
No credit, no record ofjobs you've held, no savings, no personal investments...
No social security number - you may as well not even exist...
- There is no collateral.
- No, we already have a second on the house.
But don't the testimonials count?
Did you see here the mayor's wife can't wait to become a client?
We simply can't do it.
Now, get yourself a social security card, establish credit and buy yourself a car.
You have a decided advantage.
You can get a handicapped placard and park anywhere you like.
I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.
But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.
- But that's breaking and entering.
- My parents have insurance up the rear.
What'll it cost them?
A little hassle, that's about it.
- We can't.
- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.
I don't want to.
You don't want us to have our own van where we can be alone? And a mattress in the back?
Why can't you do it?
Because the room's locked and we need Edward to get us in.
Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?
The only thing he hangs on to tighter is his dick.
- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.
- That's not true.
- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair.
- So what? There isn't any other way.
- There's gotta be.
Look, I've racked my brain.
Don't you want us to have our own van?
Yeah.
Jim, the lights are on!
Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend, I told you.
In case of burglars.
- You turned off the alarm?
- Yes. Let's go.
I hate this.
Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's house?
- This person stole from you?
- Keep it down!
I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!
Tell his parents and they'll make him give it back.
Listen, I already tried that.
Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.
Come on!
OK, come on.
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!
No, Jim, we can't just leave him here!
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do this!
- Just come on, Kim.
- Stop!
Put me down!
We know you're in there!
We're in the process of deactivating
the system so that you can come out!
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.
Jim, they can't arrest you for setting off your own alarm.
We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.
- I'm not going back there, OK?
- We have to!
No. My father would prosecute.
- His own son?
- Especially his own son.
And if Edward tells I'll kill him!
- Denny, turn around!
- No!
You have to!
We want your hands high in the air
where we can see them!
Put your hands up!
He's holding something. Looks like knives.
Drop your weapons!
I repeat- drop your weapons!
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.
If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.
Don't make us do that, buddy.
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!
Now!
Looks like we got a psycho.
- Prepare to fire!
- No!
- Stand back, ladies!
- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!
Please. We know him.
All right. Cuff him.
- But we can see him now?
- We're going to have to hold him overnight.
- He has to stay in prison all night?
- You can pick him up in the morning.
Oh, Edward!
Hello, Edward.
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.
What in God's name was going through your mind, son?
Why didn't I set a better example?
You saw how I envied Jim's parents.
What were you gonna do with that stuff?
I blithely say "We'll get money for the salon somehow", but I never meant stealing.
Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.
Stealing's not the way to get anything.
Except trouble.
And you're in a serious heap of that.
Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?
- Damn those TV programmes!
- Damn them all to hell!
Or did somebody put you up to this?
Will he be OK, doc?
The years spent in isolation have not given him the tools to judge right from wrong.
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.
Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures, hairstyles and so forth, indicate that he's a highly imaginative... character.
His awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped.
But will he be all right out there?
Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.
Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying about ya. You watch yourself, you hear?
I happened to be up, so I heard all this noise...
All along I felt in my gut there was somethin' wrong with him.
- It could have been my house.
- Or any of our houses, but...
I warned you, didn't I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.
You didn't heed my warning, but now you will. Because now you can see it too.
Edward, you stay here.
- What do you say in your defence?
- Nothing.
- He doesn't want to talk.
- You have to say something.
- He can't talk right now.
- No comments? No remarks?
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?
What do you have to say for yourself?
- One comment.
- Later.
Goodness, Lois, it looks like
I'll see you at our Christmas party before I get you over for your haircut!
Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?
Well!
You may think that, but you're wrong.
You're here.
They didn't hurt you, did they?
Were you scared?
I tried to make Jim go back, but you can't make Jim do anything.
Thank you for not telling them that we...
You're welcome.
It must have been awful when they told you whose house it was.
I knew it was Jim's house.
You did?
Yes.
Well, then why'd you do it?
Because you asked me to.
Kimba!
Kimmy!
- Don't!
- What's the matter with you?
When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.
My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free.
What more do you want?
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you. You were there too!
- You know I didn't wanna do it.
- But you did do it.
I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.
Maybe there's a way you can replace the drapes and the towels, but our confidence in you is not gonna be so easy to replace.
Dad...
OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' down the street. You find a suitcase full of money.
There's nobody around. No human person is in evidence. What do you do?
A: You keep the money.
B: You use it to buy gifts for your friends and your loved ones.
C: You give it to the poor.
D: You turn it in to the police.
- Dad, this is really stupid.
- Kim...!
- I'd keep the money.
- Simmer down.
Edward?
Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the bowling alley? That'd be fun.
You're not seeing Jim tonight?
No.
We had the coolest show and tell today.
This kid brought in a box of baby possums.
Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.
- No hair at all.
- Honey, your father isn't finished yet.
Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.
Give it to my loved ones?
Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you should do, but it's not.
You dope, everybody knows you're supposed to give it to the police.
Good thinking, Kevin.
Well, think about it, you guys.
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what I would do.
We're not trying to confuse him, we're trying to make things easier, so cut the comedy.
I am being serious, Dad.
It's a much nicer thing to do.
Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.
Shut up!
Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can't learn right from wrong, living in this family!
Well, did you hear what he did to Peg's curtains?
It's unbelievable they're having their party anyway. Are you going?
I don't think so.
He practically raped Joyce, threatening her with those knives.
It's a miracle she escaped.
I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...
I know. They've got that teenage daughter in the house.
Those poor things!
After what happened to me...
Can you imagine?
What did you say about the Christmas party?
I said I hoped we could make it.
I lied too.
Edward? Do you want to give me that new haircut?
- Again?
- Yeah, sure!
It makes me proud to have you as my own personal hairdresser.
Hi, honey.
- Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone?
- No.
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.
- People's feelings, please. A few manners!
- I'll be outside.
Never you mind, dear. Just... cut away.
# I saw three ships come sailing by
# On Christmas day in the morning
It needs something... else.
What do you think, honey?
- More bells?
- OK.
Mom, do you really think we should be having this party?
Of course I think we should be having this party.
It's just what we need to calm things down... and everything'll go back to normal.
Do you have any more bells, honey?
Now you've done it.
It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's OK.
- Touch her again and I'll kill ya.
- It's no big deal.
- Call a doctor. He skewered Kim.
- No!
Stay away from her. I mean it!
You can't touch anything without ruining it.
Why do you hang around here anyway?
I want you to sit right down and wait for me to bring you some ice.
Stay right there. I'll be right back.
Get the hell outta here!
Get the hell out! Go! Freak!
Hey, Edward, where are you goin'?
Where is he?
- He tried to hurt you.
- He did not, and you know it.
Are you nuts? I just saw him!
Jim, I don't love you any more.
I just want you to go, OK? Just go!
Are you serious?
And lose you to that? He isn't even human.
Just get out of here, OK? Just go!
Dad, did you see where Edward went?
I don't know. He just waltzed down the street.
- We have to find him, Mom.
- Your father will find him.
Go on in the house. I'll take care of it.
I'll go find him.
Edward!
I'm calling the police!
See all that blood, sweetie?
And it's just a little cut.
Hello. I'm here to see the man with the hands.
He's not here. Thank you.
Oh, dear.
Helen, did you actually see him?
Yes! Look!
I'm looking for the man with the scissors.
- Thank God you're here.
- He went right down that way, sir.
All right, calm down.
Go on home. We'll handle it.
Just go home.
- A demon. A demon.
- You gotta do somethin'!
I'm sure your father'll find him soon.
What time is it?
It's almost 8.30. Great party, huh?
Mom, where are they?
- God, I hope he's OK.
- So do I, honey.
You know, when I brought Edward down here to live with us,
I really didn't think things through.
And I didn't think about what could happen to him.
Or to us. Or to the neighbourhood.
And now I think that maybe... it might be best if he goes... back up there.
Because at least there he's safe.
And we'd just go back to normal.
I got halfway to the Whitmans'.
I didn't see him anywhere.
Let's get in the car and go look for him.
- Where's Kevin now?
- At Max's.
Oh, for God's sakes!
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- With you guys.
- You stay here in case somebody shows up.
- We'll be right back, dear.
Police!
Edward?
Are you OK?
Yes. Are you OK?
Where is everybody?
Out looking for you.
Hold me.
I can't.
I know it's a little early for Christmas, Edward, but...
I have a present for you.
Forget holding her hand.
Picture the damage he could do other places.
Yeah. That's sick.
I feel like I'm gonna pass out or puke or something.
Later. First, take me to her house.
Come on. Don't make me drive.
Just do it!
Jesus. Maybe she was right about you.
- Just drive!
- Relax!
- See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.
Have they caught him yet?
- Who?
- Him! That cripple.
Let me know when they do.
Let us all know, OK?
Like a good boy.
Kevin.
Are you OK?
It's OK.
- Edward, stop!
- I'm your friend.
Help us!
What are you doing? Get away from him!
- Let go of me!
- What?
Kevin!
- Get away!
- Edward, come home!
Run.
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch!
He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right?
Let's just leave him alone.
Go on, run.
- What happened? Is he dead?
- Did you get him?
It's all over. Go on home.
There's nothing more to see.
What happened out there?
I want to know! I want some answers!
It is all over.
Where is he?
Get back here!
I wanna ask you something!
Look at that! I don't believe this.
They don't have him. I'm goin'.
No! That's not a good idea.
They're coming?
Did I hurt Kevin?
No, he's OK. Mostly he was just scared.
Edward, I was so afraid.
I thought you were dead.
I didn't.
No!
No!
Jim, stop!
No!
Stop it. Or I'll kill you myself.
I said stay away from her!
Goodbye.
I love you.
Is he in there?
He's dead.
The roof caved in on him.
They killed each other.
You can see for yourselves.
See?
I'm goin' home.
Joyce...
She never saw him again.
Not after that night.
How do you know?
Because I was there.
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.
No, sweetheart.
I'm an old woman now.
I would rather him remember me the way I was.
How do you know he's still alive?
I don't know.
Not for sure, but...
I believe he is.
You see, before he came down here
it never snowed.
And afterwards it did.
If he weren't up there now,
I don't think it would be snowing.
Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.

An eight-year-old boy from Manhattan was delivered dead on arrival today-
The Centers for Disease Control.
Are we dealing with an epidemic?
Whatever the carrier, we know that it's not the water.
We don't believe that it's airborne.
One, two, three, four--
Strickler's Disease was first diagnosed two years ago.
We're no better off now.
I needed you to see this for yourself, Dr. Tyler.
It's the same at every hospital in the city.
For the lucky ones, it's a lifetime in leg braces.
Most of these kids won't make it.
We need your help.
Strickler's Disease came to New York... like a thief in the night, threatening to steal... an entire generation of our children from before our eyes.
Dr. Peter Mann, Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control--
The killer was cunning. It was deadly.
Neither a cure nor a vaccine could be found.
We at the CDC had to contain it... before it could spread beyond Manhattan Island.
So we went after its carrier, the common cockroach.
Or rather she did.
Dr. Susan Tyler is the reason that there hasn't been... a new case of Strickler's in this city for six months.
Dr. Susan Tyler.
Dr. Susan Tyler,
Professor of Entomology... at the New York State University.
Thank you, Peter.
I don't think I need to tell you
New Yorkers just how resilient... the common cockroach is.
Since it has proven to be virtually immune to chemical control... we had to find a new avenue of attack.
So, with the aid of genetics labs across the country... we recombined termite and mantid DNA to create a biological counteragent... a new species to be our six-legged ally... in wiping out the roach population.
We call it the "Judas" breed.
Once in contact with the Judas' secretions... the common roaches were infected with an enzyme... which caused their metabolism to go into overdrive.
Come on, Susan!
You're missing it.
No matter how much the common roaches ate... every last member of the nest... starved to death within a matter of hours.
I hope someone's taping this.
This announcement's been a long time coming...
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Coming home.
The Strickler's outbreak has officially been contained.
- The epidemic is over.
- Hey, Susan. Honey.
Any other questions?
Dr. Mann, what did this victory mean to you personally?
It means that I can move on to other projects with the...
Our 15 minutes are gone.
And personally it's where I met my wife.
What is this? Is this some kind of Catholic guilt thing?
We don't even know what the impact is of what we did.
The impact is that... a lot of kids will be running around next year because of you.
A lot of kids.
- Hey!
- Maybe we get lucky.
Maybe a couple of them'll be ours someday.
Oh, a couple, huh?
Oh, okay. We're not rushing things.
I didn't want to overtax you.
It's been a hard year.
It's been a great year.
Oxfords. Seven and a half.
Black. Leather soles.
Funny, funny shoes.
Funny--
Can you raise it a little bit on the left?
It's sort of drooping. Don't you think?
Husband, incoming, 6:00.
- I'm sorry I was late.
- Everything crazy out there today?
I got T.B. breaking out all over the city... and the mayor's in my face about scaring off another convention.
It's Bruce.
I'll call him later.
So, nice lunch, huh?
- Very nice lunch.
- Choose.
- What's this?
- Come on, choose.
Oh, honey, why'd you get this?
Baby in a bottle.
It's ours.
Dr. Chadwick said if you take that twice a we--
- Do you know where this comes from?
- Sure.
It comes from the urine of Italian menopausal nuns.
So? Monks bottle their own wine, so--
Not natural, Peter.
Would you at least think about this?
For the last six months...
I've been the one running around with ice in my underwear.
And that's not natural.
I really got to go.
See you.
Hold it right there, sir.
CDC.
Hey, Boss, welcome to disease land.
- Tuck it in.
- All right. All right.
We sure this is yellow fever?
- What, are you ignoring your pages now?
- Listen, l--
Okay, these two cops saw the broken scaffold, and then the paint mess here.
And then they looked through that cellar window.
Go ahead. Take a look.
Pleasant, isn't it?
Couldn't let 'em out until you gave me the okay, so--
This piece of shit chapel here is a front for the Triads.
Chinese mob.
The snake had people in from UNAD.
Slave labor.
How long have they been operating?
I don't know. Five, six years. Too long.
- Oh, have you had lunch?
- Uh-huh.
Try to keep it down when you see this, okay?
Roughly three dozen people were trapped in here.
One toilet, no paper.
We got bacterial samples reading off the scale, though nothing's airborne.
- We got a Reverend Harry Ping.
- Preacher?
Yeah. Preacher, if you can imagine that.
He ran this place.
But there's no sign of him.
So what do you say, boss?
Quarantine 'em.
Quarantine the cops that found it.
Quarantine anybody who touched anything.
Immigration's gonna love you.
Tell 'em to send the flowers to the usual address.
You got it.
Piece of shit on the ceiling.
- Figure that one out.
- Here you go, Josh.
The subway?
You know what?
This is what I love about my job.
I get to travel, see the world... and meet new exotic cultures.
It's... It's all bacterial, but hey, what the fuck, right?
You're gonna be okay.
We'll take care of you.
Hey, she doesn't speak English.
You tell her, please.
Man, she's delirious.
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.
She keeps saying something like the dark angels.
She says they're coming to get her.
Chinese people, man.
They come up with some pretty wild stuff.
- Thanks a lot, Miguel.
- Board up every exit.
If this leads to the subways,
I don't want anything to spread.
Quarantine everybody.
But in the middle of the third date, he tells me that he wears women's underwear.
What a pervert.
This city is full of perverts.
Some of your fans.
- You're the bug lady, right?
- That's me.
We're here to deal.
When you pick them up, you should pick 'em up by this front vein on the wing...
'cause it's the strongest part of the wing.
See, that way you don't break it.
Now, let's see what else you have in here. Oh, look.
- What do we have here?
- Swallowtail?
- Excellent.
- How come you like bugs so much?
Just imagine that you're one of them.
What, eating furniture and stuff?
That's gotta suck.
No, no, no.
Now, donât judge them too quickly.
These guys were building castles while dinosaurs were still wimpy little lizards.
Now, say youâre him.
He's what we call a soldier.
Now, there is no way that you would ever quit fighting... no matter how badly injured you were.
It would be a battle to the death.
But most insects don't kill... unless their territory is invaded.
You'd just stun your prey up here.
And then you drag it all the way down through here to there... into what is kind of like a pantry.
We eat it alive?
Yeah. You're not really squeamish about those kind of things.
This is the nest.
It's the heart of the colony.
The big enchilada.
- Why?
- If anything were to happen to the nest... the entire colony would die out.
I'd just bail and start my own.
Well, you couldn't do that.
See... that big guy there?
Next to the queen?
Wait. Look over there.
He's the king. And out of all the nest, he's the only fertile male.
He got a good deal.
Yeah.
It's a simple structure designed for their survival.
It's perfectly balanced, and it's very beautiful.
Whatever peels your banana, lady.
So, you wanna buy the butterflies, or what?
You know what?
You guys have done a really good job.
So, how about five bucks?
That's your best?
- I'm gonna show her the weird bug.
- Costs a dollar just to look.
It's a really great bug.
Got it on the subway.
- We kind of broke it a little.
- Okay. My best offer.
Ten bucks for everything, plus a specimen jar, some tweezers and some mounts.
Deal.
Are you crazy? This is the best.
This is our meal ticket.
Come on. Bug's almost dead anyway.
It's yours.
- You gave 'em ten bucks.
- They're from Alphabet City.
There's much worse things they could be selling.
Oh, no. Your papers.
Help me get the window.
Susan. Push.
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, I hate this window.
Okay, on three. One, two, three.
Who the hell do you think you are putting my two officers on quarantine?
Listen to me, Captain.
Those two, they go home... they kiss their wives, they kiss their kids... and I'm the one with a full-blown epidemic--
Come on, Chuy. We have to make dinner.
- Dinner.
- I don't care.
Well, I do care! Jesus, God, I hate cops.
They make the worst coffee.
- Shiny wire.
- Don't stare. People look back if you stare.
I've had limited success with this combination of pheromones... because it tends to wear off.
But now, watch this male when I add sound.
See, this is a female
I recorded in the field.
Look at him go.
It's like the Donna Summer of cricketdom.
Wow. He wants it bad.
Siren song.
If we put these speakers in fields that are overinfested... we can collect the males, save the crops... and restore the balance of the ecosystem.
All without putting harmful chemicals in food.
What the hell?
Shit!
Those kids, we've gotta find them.
- I can't believe this.
- What?
I spend an hour in the field.
I get a weekend's worth of crap.
Oh, speaking of that.
That turd that I took to the lab?
I found these in it.
What are they?
- Buttons.
- Buttons?
Maybe they needed fiber.
Wow.
Oh, my God. Youâre just a baby.
Oh, my God.
The transfer of recombinant genetic material... from termites and mantids into Judas breed will allow rapid enzymatic change...
...insuring 100% sterility in all Judas females...
...utilization of a suicide gene...
...leading to a life expectancy of 120 to 180 days.
Not too little... and not too much.
You rub it in.
Around and around.
Like this, huh?
Let the leather take it.
Funny shoes.
Aieee. Mr. Funny Shoes.
No one is there.
It's empty.
Chuy, listen to me.
They have Jesus on the cross... but that is not a holy place.
Can you call me back tonight?
Thanks, Officer.
Cops are on it.
Good.
Well, they said--
Can you do me a favor and hold off working at night for awhile?
I can't do that. I was actually thinking I had to get back...
Susan, someone broke into your office, okay?
I'm sorry about you losing your specimen...
- but let's try and get our priorities straight.
- This is not just a specimen.
I did a pH test, and there are only two species that match what I found.
Now, one of them is a leafcutter ant in the Amazon.
The other one we released here three years ago.
You said--
You said the ones we released only had a life span of six months.
We engineered them to be sterile adults.
The Judases were not supposed to last past one generation.
- So what happened?
- The one I examined today was a baby.
They were designed to die.
They are breeding.
I shine them good.
Chuy, Black Lincoln. Chuy?
Black Lincoln. This one.
Chuy... pay attention, please.
This is where you found the bug?
Yeah, man. But they changed the lock.
You sure you haven't seen one of those?
No. What is it?
It's an ootheca. It's kind of a fancy name for an egg case.
There's probably more, like, weird bugs inside of it.
No way. I see one of those, I puke.
Here you go.
- Here.
- Hold on.
Is there money to be made on this egg thing?
- Sorry.
- Dealing days are over. Vamonos.
These egg things look nasty.
Thought you liked finding nasty things.
Well, what if we go find these things.
She'll pay us, right?
Is that all you think about?
Come on.
This bug. What does it look like?
Did you hear that?
- How deep does this go?
- Let's see.
Let's take a look.
- You see anything?
- Not yet.
Shit.
I dropped it.
I can't reach it.
Let me try. My hands are smaller.
- Just leave it.
- Well, no. Wait. I think I'm almost there.
I already told you this is CDC business.
And I'm telling you that those lockers are MTA business.
Okay, we'll-- we'll pay for the lock that we broke, Officer.
- I mean, whatever we can do...
- Lady, who am I talking to now?
- You or him?
- You're talking to me, okay? You're talking to me.
All we wanna see is...
See what? That's the old maintenance bridge, buddy.
This insect that we are looking for...
Look, man. Your lady want a bug... or its eggs, or whatever she wants, that's fine by me.
But it's like Swiss cheese down there.
Tunnels in, tunnels out, old tracks.
You go messing around, break your neck, and it's my ass on the line.
Lace-up shoes. Black. Nine West.
Chuy, finish your sandwich.
It's good. It's chicken.
Penny loafers. Eleven.
Double E.
Hey.
- He's really good at that.
- Oh, yes.
He imitates anything.
Doesn't he go to school?
He doesn't need school. He's special.
What you making there?
Is that a superhero?
Mr. Funny Shoes.
He knows everything about shoes.
- Hey, I'm talking to you.
- No, you're talking at me!
You come back with the proper permits.
Maybe we'll have a conversation.
- Great. We'll do lunch.
- Yeah, I look forward to it.
Uptown.
What happened?
Napoleon is alive and well and working for the MTA.
We have to get down there.
He wants a permit?
I'll give him a real special one.
What's that?
Is that the egg thing?
Give me a hand.
Oh, man, that smells.
I can hear the bugs inside.
Come on. Cut it.
She's gonna give us at least 40 bucks.
What's up?
I think there's a guy down there.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit! It's got me!
Help! Oh, God, please! Please, help me!
Alex!
A philosopher named Hobbes once wrote that...
"Life, by its very nature, is nasty, brutish and short. "
An ant would put it more succinctly:
Can I eat it or will it eat me?
It's this kind of simplicity... that governs the phylum Insecta.
Hello?
- It's me. I got the permits.
- You did?
- We're going down first thing tomorrow.
- Okay, that's great.
Listen, honey, I gotta go right now.
I'll call you later.
- ... or of cellular phones...
- Okay. as my distinguished colleague can tell you.
So, you think your little Frankenstein has got the better of you?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I really need to find some answers, Walter.
Dear Susan... is it answers you want from me, or is it absolution?
You still think making the Judases was wrong?
Three years ago,
I would've called it unforgivable.
But I have two grandchildren who are alive today probably because of you.
It would be a tad hypocritical for me to pass judgement.
That's not an answer, Walter.
It's not an easy question.
But as to the Judases...
I think it's likely some survived.
Evolution has a way of keeping things alive.
But they all died in the lab.
Yes, Susan.
But you let them out... into the world.
The world's a much bigger lab.
Funny shoes.
Hold on. Something's blocking filter "D."
Something's blocking filter "D"!
Jules, come on, man. Hurry it up.
Fuck off.
It's not a date.
Oh, God.
What's the problem?
I think it's a kid.
- Yeah.
- Hi, Peter. It's Remy.
- Yeah, hi.
- Is Susan there? I need to talk to her.
- How you doin'?
- Fine.
It's really important.
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
What do you got there?
- Where?
- Right down there. In your hand.
- Nothing.
- Oh, are we testing it?
Maybe.
- Are we testing it?
- Uh-huh, maybe. I don't know. Could be.
- It's Remy.
- Oh, good. Okay. So give me the phone.
Come on. Come here.
Give me the phone.
- Are we testing it?
- Yes.
Can you hold on, Remy?
Hey. What's up?
- They found what?
- At the water filtration plant.
- What's going on?
- Okay, I'll be there in about 20 minutes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
How long you got?
Patience.
We'll just try again.
Try again.
You know, sometimes these things can be wrong.
That's okay. I gotta go, okay? Bye, babe.
Susan, we got the subway thing today.
Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna have to meet you there when I'm done.
Wait.
When you're done from what?
Boots, toys, beer bottles... body parts, cocaine-filled condoms... little baby alligators.
Shit, you wouldn't believe the stuff I'd seen.
Yep.
They flush 'em down. We fish 'em out.
But this thing.
We didn't know what this was.
We were thinking about throwing it away, but then I remembered Remy.
Jeremy plays bass in my band.
Anyway. So--
Yep. I remember Remy says to me...
"If it's got more than four legs, it's not a mammal. "
It's a lobster, right?
My father saw me stay in bed... he'd go get the pitcher of cold water, and whoosh!
I tell you, that's some alarm clock.
Wow.
- How big did you say these bugs are?
- Come on. Hurry up.
You know, my shift's almost over.
I need my beauty sleep.
Man, if I'm blowing off my Saturday, then so are you.
Yeah. It looks like somebody requested you for overtime.
Come on. Hurry up.
Let's find these things.
We've got a long way to go.
All right. Watch your step there.
We've got burrows going down seven stories here.
- No shit?
- Oh, yeah.
It's five stories down, partner.
You fall, I don't wanna come back and pick you up.
Okay, it's all yours. Go ahead.
- It's 48 hours anyway.
- I can't wait that long.
It's 48 hours. Now listen, you got something to write with?
- Yes, yes. I write it.
- You gotta write this down.
Come on. Here's the case number.
It's two-seven--
Wait a sec. Two, seven. Yes, two-seven--
- Eight-three.
- Eight-three.
- All right. You got that?
- What does this mean, case number?
It means I deal with you in 48 hours, okay?
Mr. Funny Shoes.
People actually do live down here?
Yeah, man. The mole people.
This section was pretty popular all the way to Fulton Street.
Tweeked-out crackheads, dopeheads, shitheads, mental cases.
Then suddenly, poof! All gone.
Rumors got started.
Someone found a couple of stiffs.
They make up some crap about a killer.
Overcoat Slim, Long John.
Now, down here is the land of talk.
The wildest version goes the farthest.
This is mole speak, man. Hobo language.
Most of'em, they can't read or write.
They mark out an area with a sign or drawing, and it's as good as closed.
Here, here. See? This one.
This one says, "Go away.
Man with gun. " That's me.
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me again.
- Susan?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Susan.
- Peter?
Yeah. Susan?
- Can you hear me?
- Barely.
I haven't found a thing yet.
Okay, I have. I have to talk to you right away in person.
How long would it take to get back to the platform?
About 30 minutes, you knock off the sightseeing.
Susan--
I'll meet you at the platform at a quarter to 12:00.
Honey, did you say quarter to 12:00?
Peter?
Susan, the test was positive.
- The test was positive.
- Peter?
Peter, I can't hear you!
Oh, damn it.
The test was...
Susan! Shit. Susan?
She didn't wait long enough.
Hi, Doc. Susan sent you some homework.
I see--
What's this? Look!
The organs are... perfectly formed.
They were functional.
I'm guessing here, and, of course... they don't have a complete specimen, but--
What do you think it is?
This thing... is not just some random mutation.
It's a highly evolved soldier caste... formidable killer.
It couldn't have developed in a vacuum.
It's part of a colony.
This way, this way.
Should have stayed at the office.
- How much longer do we have to go?
- Keep looking around.
It's the size of your palm.
Man. Take a whiff.
- God, it smells like acid.
- No. It's ammonia.
Hey, guys.
There's some weird shit here.
What kind of weird shit?
Lots of it.
Oh, Jesus.
God!
Man!
Go ahead and ask him. Ask.
You seen anything like this before?
Why're you asking me if I've ever seen some shit like this before?
Do I look like I've seen some shit like this before?
Hell, no, I ain't never seen no shit like this before!
Who the fuck would wanna climb up these walls and hang one of these?
Must've been a big elephant-ass motherfucker. I don't know who the fuck...
The Delancey Street station will be closing in five minutes.
Please find alternate routes to your destination.
- Carlito?
- Yeah?
Oh, come on, Peter. Hurry up.
Do you have the time?
Sir, the time?
You know, my father always wanted me to become a dentist.
I said, "No way.
I'm not gonna spend my life looking into people's open mouths. "
What could be worse than that, right?
Oh, man, I've never been this deep.
This is the old Armory Station.
Hey, they built it around the turn of the century.
It's been closed for decades.
- Yeah, I guess we covered everything.
- Hey, look.
You got your shit. I'm happy for you.
Let's get the hell outta here, huh?
Okay, Josh, I want a full team in here by 6:00 tonight.
All right.
Oh, shit!
- What the fuck?
- No, don't!
Look what the fuck you did, man!
You see the size of that thing?
Peter, are you all right?
It's okay, Josh.
It's okay. I think I'm okay.
- Get the hell off me.
- Yeah, I think he's okay too.
How am I gonna get you back up?
I don't know.
See a way up?
- No.
- Shit.
There is no way up.
- Oh, man, that's gonna work!
- Do you know a better way up?
Hey... show that to the station manager.
Tell him Leonard said he's gonna have his bubble-butt... if he don't have someone down here in ten--
Wait a second.
I can't find my way back alone.
Look, look, look.
Just go back the same way we came.
Wait, wait.
- All right.
- Take the first tunnel to the left.
Then go to the fourth, right?
Then right, right, left, right?
Left, fourth-- Peter, can I just stay here and help you guys back up?
Toss the glow-sticks down and just go, Josh, please.
Just keep headin' up.
You're gonna get there.
- Hurry!
- All right, all right! I got it.
Help me!
Help! Please, help!
Help! Please!
Help!
Please! Please! Somebody, please help me!
There were four brothers
Piece of shit.
This is really weird.
We should've seen some track bunnies by now.
- What are they?
- Track bunnies. Rats.
They're usually around.
- They big?
- You damn right.
Yeah, yeah
Got a telegram this mornin'
Sayin' my wife was dead
Show it to Mr. Moore
He said, Might as you know, boy
You gotta plow ol' Red
That white man says,
"It's rainin' and I'm way behind
I may let you bury that woman, Sam one of these old dinner times"
I told him, "No, Mr. Moore"
I dropped what I was doin'
Whoa, I cried till my eyes was red
You know I love that woman
And now she's gone
Could you just knock it off, please?
Knock it off.
- Hey, I sing when I'm nervous.
- Yeah.
Turn these lights back on.
- What?
- You said the cables are still alive.
- Oh, man.
- Maybe we can rewire them.
There you go again.
- What?
- How are you gonna rewire all of this?
- You need a whole crew down here to do that.
- What is your problem, man?
- Do you need a memo every time you take a shit?
- Oh, don't go there.
You better be careful how you speak to people.
Josh?
He wouldn't be comin' from there.
Manny, what the hell are you doin' here?
Hurry.
The lady needs help.
Hey, honey, we're coming!
Oh, Jesus, please hurry.
Please. Come on!
Oh, no! It's coming!
What the fuck is that?
Come on. Get her, man!
Get her! What the fuck is that?
- What the fuck...
- Go!
Look there! There! There!
The car! The car!
Close the door!
Close the fuckin' door!
What the fuck was that?
- Come on. Here. Here, here, here!
- Just wait a minute!
Fuck it! You wait a minute!
I wanna make sure!
It's not dead.
Yeah, well, it's gonna be!
Very soon, lady!
- There it is.
- Drag it out.
- There it is!
- Drag it out!
You better tell me... what the hell's goin' on around here.
Oh, man.
Okay, Leonard. Okay.
It's gonna be fine. You'll be fine.
Okay.
You just stay calm.
Okay, there we go.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, Christ.
- Josh will be here soon. He'll bring us some help.
- You're dreamin', man.
If your boy was comin' back, he'd have been here by now.
- They got his ass, man. They ate his ass, man.
- We don't know that.
And if you think there's not another one of those things out there... what has been puttin' that shit all over the walls?
Listen, Leonard.
If you keep on screaming like that... we're gonna meet the rest of its family.
Manny? Manny, be careful.
- It-It's dead.
- No, no, no.
I emptied two clips into that thing and it kept comin'.
Wait, wait a second. Help me turn it over.
Peter, these are lungs.
What the hell is she talkin' about?
Biology 101. You know, insects don't have lungs.
- That's what limits their size.
- The secretions are the same.
Oh, God.
When I increased the Judasâs metabolism, I must have sped up its breeding cycle.
I mean, we're talking tens, hundreds of thousands of generations.
- I mean, who knows how many mutations.
- Listen, l--
I just don't fuckin' get this.
How could the--
How could the Judas evolve into this?
Think generations, not years, okay?
It took only 40,000 generations for apes to turn into humans.
So?
We changed its DNA, Peter.
I mean, we don't know what we did!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Hold on!
If that thing has been around, how come--
How come nobody's ever seen it?
I think we have.
Sometimes an insect will evolve to mimic its predator.
A fly can look like a spider.
A caterpillar can look like a snake.
The Judas evolved to mimic its predator.
Us.
Nobody up there knows about this?
Nobody would. Not until it's too late.
These things can imitate us.
They can infiltrate us and breed a legion before anyone would even notice.
How could you do this?
You take something and you make it like a man.
- A man who's not a man, he's a--
- Manny!
- He's a thing!
- Manny!
That steals my child!
Manny, you tell her,
'cause she don't give a goddamn.
- Your kid's gone.
- Hey, shut up.
- My leg's chewed to the bone!
- Shut up, will ya? Shut the fuck up!
- And they're both talkin' about insects with lungs!
- Shut up!
Oh, shit! They're everywhere!
Manny, get over here!
It's the blood!
- The smell of the blood is driving them crazy!
- Oh, shit!
We have to cover the scent!
Manny, give me your razor.
Give me your razor!
Here. Take it. Rub it on the windows.
- Anywhere where there's a crack.
- Wha--
- Just do it!
- Come on!
What the... What is it?
Scent glands. Insects use them to identify themselves.
Here. Rub it all over yourself.
They won't attack you if they think youâre one of them.
Me!
It worked.
Do you mind if...
Go ahead.
Manny, give me your lighter.
Look. This is where we are.
Now, these tunnels may lead to the surface.
- Yes.
- If we can get... this car moving, we might be able to make it.
What--
What do you mean, might?
I mean, probably.
But even if they do... this thing's been down here rotting for half a century.
- How do you know it'll move?
- Listen to me. Listen.
This car is a CR-17 from Coney Island.
Believe me, it was made to last.
Now, Manny... there's a track relay switch in this room here.
- You switch the tracks. That'll get us going.
- Yes, I'll try.
- I'll try.
- Do.
There's a fuse box down the tracks.
If I can rewire it,
I can juice up the whole system.
Leonard, man.
- Look at yourself, l--
- I'll do it.
Hey, if you talk me through it,
I'll go out there.
- All you've gotta do is...
- No, no, no, no. I'll go.
- I'll go.
- Why?
I know much more about what's out there than you do.
You're right.
You understand the creature, and...
Leonard knows the subway, so-- so this is the way it's gotta be.
- Whatever happens, it's Manny and me.
- Why?
You two have gotta stay on this car.
You gotta get back up.
You gotta undo this.
So, I'll go.
We'll go.
Yes.
I have to put this on you now.
They mimic us. We mimic them.
Peter, Peter. Peter, look.
You'll find two wires... one green, the other blue.
Okay.
Man, this shit can't be sanitary.
Take it off.
No, man. Leave it on. Leave it on.
Don't touch it.
Try not to sweat.
They sense chemical changes.
Oh, okay.
Okay, I'll try not to sweat.
Susan, he's in.
He just needs to find the switch.
Good.
Green. Blue.
Green, blue. Green, blue.
Shit.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh--
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Chuy, it's me.
Come on, Manny. What's takin' you so long?
Do these subway tracks lead to the regular train tunnels... at Grand Central and Penn Station?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, they'll use them to migrate out of the city.
After that, they'll set up colonies anywhere they can.
Fuck.
Now, every specimen we've seen has been female... because a male would be a lighter color and it would have no wings.
And if they are holding true to the Judasâs spawning pattern... the nest will have only one fertile male.
Now, if we could catch that male and kill him... then the females won't be able to breed... and the whole generation could die out.
Where the hell is the male?
Chuy, come here.
Come here. Come here.
Friends.
Come here, please.
Oh, goddamn it! He must be in trouble!
- He must be in trouble!
- Wait. Listen.
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm goin' out there.
You stay here.
Listen. If the car starts...
I'll meet you at the end of the platform.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Manny.
Yes! Yes! CR-17 from Coney Island!
Goddamn it!
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!
Goddamn! Shit!
Leonard!
Get away! Go away! I'm bleeding!
- Found a way out, on a dumbwaiter.
- Go away!
Peter, I'm bleeding. Go away!
I can't stop it.
- I can't stop it. They'll be here soon.
- Where's my wife?
- Go away.
- Where's Susan?
- Where's Susan?
- She went to get Manny.
They haven't seen us yet. Don't move.
Peter, go!
- At an old general station
- Oh, my God.
Please send a train
Leonard?
You see
My health is failin' me
And I ain't got too much time
- Come on, Chuy.
- Hurry!
All right, come on in.
That's all right. That's a good boy.
No, no, it's all right.
Stop. Stop it.
It's okay. It's okay. All right, Peter.
Come on. Get in. Get in, Peter.
Come on. Chuy, shh! Stop it!
Stop it!
Get in, get in, get in.
- Peter, what are you doing?
- I gotta stop them here.
Oh, no. Peter, don't do this!
Peter! No! No!
Oh, Jesus! Don't! No!
Chuy! Chuy! Stop it. Stop it.
Train!
We're here! Help!
Oh, Jesus.
Go on, Chuy. Go on.
Get out! Hurry! Go!
Fuck you!
Look out!
Oh, my God.
It's the male.
No!
You will not hurt him! No! Turn around!
Turn around!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Police and emergency crews continue their work... in the aftermath of tonightâs explosions on the Lower East Side.
Hustle up! Teams leader!
We swept the area twice.
It's burned.
Nothing could have survived down there.
What about one of us?
I'm sorry, Susan.
I really am.
Shiny wire.
Mountain boots. Ten.
Brown.
We're gonna have a baby.
We're gonna have a baby.
My poor baby.
Who has stolen the child's dream?
The mad genius Krank in his evil scheme.
To what vicious depths will he not descend?
Will the tale turn to tragedy... or have a happy end?
Step up. ladies and gentlemen!
Step right up! Come closer.
Don't be afraid.
See the strongest man in the world.
Look at those chains. made of the same steel... as that used to lift--
Yes, my friends--
The true light is invisible.
Penetrate the corridor of shadows... and you will enter the world of the chosen ones.
Renounce the gift of sight. l know there are skeptics among you... afraid to share with us the dead of night.
Be brave.
Renounce your gift of sight.
Pluck out your eyes.
Come and join us.
Help us build a better world.
The crusher Bones is going to try once more to shatter steel... only using the power of his mighty arms.
Please, ladies and gentlemen, l want absolute silence... during the demonstration. l must beg of you, for your own safety... not to look him in the eye... because his power of concentration is so great... that he might provoke a cerebral hemorrhage... in the weaker ones among you.
Mr. One, ready?
And now, attention!
Little thief!
Stealing money from orphans. l'll teach you !
Let go of that!
What's going on?
What's the matter?
The poor man's not well.
Don't move!
Don't move or l'll waste you!
Denree!
Kill him!
- Who's that?
- He's the strong man at the fun fair.
I don't know him.
What do you want? l have lost little brother.
He didn't come all by himself.
Well. well, kiddies, hard at work? lt looks like you're doing really well.
Thanks for waiting for us.
Thank you.
Just remember. my ears are so sharp... that l can hear you think.
Go buy yourself some sweets.
Don't overdo it.
Come on. Move your bum.
Go on. Here.
Move it!
Get the tools and let's beat it.
Move it!
Those rotten Cyclops.
Don't worry.
We know where to find them.
And him?
What about him?
You helped us out.
Here. Now we're even.
Hey. girl. Cyclops.
You know where to find Cyclops?
Will you get lost?
Beat it!
Happy birthday, Uuncle dear
Our wish is mosf sincere
We hope this cake of ours will bring you happiness
Good fortune and success
Wait till the candles are blown out!
In fair or foul weafher
We'll always be together
Happy birthday, Uncle Irvin.
A cake for me?
You're really too kind.
Are you ready, children?
Not you.
You've got a cold.
One, two.
What is all this bellowing about?
But, sweetheart, it's lrvin's birthday. lrvin's birthday?
Why, of course.
How could l have forgotten?
Let us celebrate.
Let us all make merry.
Everyone, let's shout!
Scream out!
Krank, come back. l had a thought last night. lf these children only have nightmares... it's perhaps because the evil is in you.
Why not seek the cause of your torment... in the molecular study of your own tears?
Who could make me cry?
Well. boss... we could make you cry with laughter. l aa a gnome a bag of bones
A man of means and full of beans
The girls in Spain sing my refrains l've such a pain that it's insane
You mustn't be angry.
Your brothers are doing their best.
My brothers?
May I give it a try?
Go ahead, mollusk.
Once upon a time, there was an inventor so gifted... that he could create life.
- Truly remarkable man.
- Ah. a fairy tale. l can already feel tears in my eyes.
Since he had no wife or children... he decided to make them in his laboratory.
He started with his wife and fashioned her... into the most beautiful princess in the world.
Alas, a wicked genetic fairy cast a spell on the inventor... so much so that the princess was only knee-high to a grasshopper.
He then cloned six children in his own image.
Faithful. hardworking. they were so alike... no one could tell them apart.
But fate tricked him again, giving them all sleeping sickness.
Craving someone to talk to, he grew in a fish tank... a poor migraine-ridden brain.
And then. at last. he created his masterpiece... more intelligent than the most intelligent man on Earth.
But, alas. the inventor made a serious mistake.
While his creation was intelligent, he, too, had a defect.
He never, ever had a dream.
You can't imagine how quickly he grew old... because he was so unhappy.
Boss.
There!
An eye dropper, quick!
An eye dropper!
Then the poor masterpiece became so crazed... that he believed a single teardrop could save him.
And, after committing many cruel deeds... he died a horrible death... never knowing what it is to dream.
Get out!
All of you, get out!
Good-bye, Uncle. Happy birthday.
See you tonight.
Silence... you glub!
What do you expect us to do with that? l wouldn't waste a nail to hang it up.
But it's pretty. isn't it?
Don't get smart with us.
The picklock won't always be there to save your behind.
All right. get lost.
- That's all?
- Afraid so. lf you keep being sassy--
You'll be sorry.
There's no shortage of orphans. Miette.
Listen carefully, Tadpole.
You don't want to go to the hole, do you?
- lt's very cold there.
- And pitch black.
And full of spiders.
So give us all the rest.
The rest.
There's a fine lad.
See? When you want to.
Now, the second shift.
The neighborhood's calm, isolated.
But be careful.
You never know.
There's a backyard.
You'lI go that way with all the stuff.
On the landing, there are three doors.
One is locked from inside.
That's the one that must be forced.
Behind is what interests us.
Here's the prize. lt's identical to the one where he hides his loot.
The problem with this safe: it takes two hours to crack it.
Two hours?
We're going to get caught.
We have no choice, unless you know someone capable of carrying it.
Somebody got in.
- You big idiot!
- He's right here now.
Do l pay you to sleepwalk?
Who is this guy?
- Don't ask me.
- l know who he is.
The strong man at the fair, the one who breaks his chains.
Are you thinking what l'm thinking?
Nice going, Mr. One.
One don't like whistles.
One not thief.
A thief? Who's a thief?
We're not stealing, just borrowing.
What he said?
He said you can take it back. lt just won't be as heavy.
- The true lighf.
- Little brother.
Renounce the gift of sighf and penefrate fhe corridor of shadows... the world of the blind.
That guy is crazy.
The Octopus will kill us.
Tell her l'll bring him back. l won't be long.
Help us build a beffer world... or we shall wifness a reign of ferror.
One! Where do you think you're going?
Cyclops truck.
Denree, little brother.
What about the truck?
Cyclops truck.
Kidnap Denree.
Kidnap little brother.
You know something?
You won't find Cyclops truck like that.
When you get there, someone will have eaten Denree.
The wolf will have eaten him.
Take a break.
No use wearing out your shoes. l know where the truck's going.
Miette and One together?
And then what?
And anyway. how old was this brother of yours?
Little, little brother.
Found him... one night... on his rubbish bin, crying.
One comes close.
Discover--
Okay. l can guess the rest.
He's just like l thought.
He's too little to bother.
Let's go.
We have to get out of here.
Stupid! lmbecile! ldiot!
Have you finished?
My crystal glasses are broken!
You'll crack my chandelier!
Are you calmer now?
One look for Denree.
See you.
Oh. come on, fat head.
- Where did those brats go?
- l don't know. lt's the big guy's fault.
Miette's different since he came.
Does he have all the jewels?
That's all he's interested in?
You had big ideas?
Poor little Tadpole.
You haven't fallen in love. too. like the others? Get to bed!
- Filthy brats.
- All the same.
We really can't count on them.
- Raise crows, they'll rip out--
- Your eyes.
- lt's the best ones who want to go.
- lt's not the first time it's happened. lt's always the same old story.
- Remember little Lucas six years ago?
- And Marcus before.
Yes, Marcus. l'd almost forgotten him.
- When we think--
- Of everything we've done for them.
And if she had an accident?
You never know.
At that moment. the winkles suddenly break into a dance... then cast off their shells and begin to use them as megaphones... to announce the concert.
Winkles. winkles.
Shells. shells.
And then, at that moment... all the winkles cast off their shells... and use them as megaphones to announce the concert.
The winkles?
The winkles cast off their shells?
Please continue.
Continue, and with colors as well.
Yes. yes. yes.
Then the hammerhead shark plays xylophone with the catfish bones.
The walrus plays the Jew's harp with the... the sperm whale's suspenders.
The sea is blue like the sky... and the sky is blue
Iike the South Seas.
And l don't know if l'm swimming in the sky or... or flying at the bottom of the sea. l swear it gives me the shivers.
Shivers? Shivers all over.
And igloos?
Oh, yes, tell me about the igloos. lgloos that turn into mushrooms.
Ah. it's you. my boy. l was expecting you.
Not so loud. Turn it down.
The boss might hear you.
The boss? He's out of a test tube, like all of us.
Lay the boy in the sarcophagus and come here.
But before--
Well, you promised me--
What's tormenting you, my son?
Well, this story that among us there's an original clone... different from the others. ls that true?
Of course it's true. The others are nothing but cheap copies... while the original one is unique.
- Unique?
- Yes.
And do you know who it is?
Do you really want to know?
Connect yourself to the child.
- To the child?
- Yes.
Connect myself to the child?
But l can't. lt's forbidden.
Exactly.
The others wouldn't dare, but you, you can do it... because you're the original.
Me? l'm the original?
But it's not lonely being the original?
All the penguins, the centipedes. everyone applauds.
Except, even if you climb to the treetops... it's impossible to catch the candy floss.
And so, everybody climbs to the top of the mountain... except the giraffes who, of course, stay in one spot... munching the clouds.
Sleep.
Sleep, my little one. l am the sandman... and you can't resist me.
Your eyelids are so heavy.
Sleep. my little one.
The snowflakes evaporate... and then turn into hailstones. ln the farmyards... the turkeys scramble towards... the hailstones.
The better to peck them?
And then when the children's voices cry for help... the chickens are merciless.
There.
Now he's going to come around very nicely.
- Who, the boss?
- No. the child.
He's a real nightmare factory.
- What's that? A fuse blew!
- Perfect.
Be careful.
Someone will hear you. lt's hard to be original.
Now, throw this message-- uh, bottle into the sea.
- Yes.
- Go on!
May soaeone find my plea fo get it over wifh. l...
Gabriel Marie... l came into this world with open eyes... but l saw a world... that was a world of dogs.
Litter of dogs!
And so, the creator... sent me down here to Earth... to recover the power... that men have illegally seized.
My brothers... you who have joined me in this struggle... understand that together we must fight... human beings... from their own grounds.
The world... of appearances. l thought we had agreed on half a dozen.
But you know it's becoming more and more difficult.
People are suspicious.
They've put up posters. ln any case. this batch is as fresh as they come.
Not one of them is over five years oId.
Listen. Let us have maybe a couple of hours... and we'll sort this thing out.
Only the third eye... will enable you to enter... the world of appearances.
But beware... because this sordid world of temptation and perversion... is also the world of desire.
Try. Brother Angel Joseph... to discover it... without your losing sight... of the only true light.
Be strong.
My brothers... our grace... our great superior race... shall reign once more... on Earth !
From that day on... our faithful third eye... will become useless... as the world of appearances... will be abolished. lt's Denree. l see!
What's that?
That, Brother Angel Joseph... is a female.
- A female.
- Do you have a problem?
What's that?
That is a condemned man.
Take them. Go on !
Come back when those idiots have had enough.
Search her!
What is it?
Kill her!
She's clean.
Then tomorrow night at Pier 24.
We'll never get half that.
One more scrap of information.
A girl in a red dress... with a big moron.
We found these on them.
But there was much more in the--
What'll you do with them?
A midnight snack for the fishes, tonight. Pier 24.
A midnight snack for the fishes.
- lrvin?
- Such a migraine.
You know all about feelings.
Won't you try to help me?
Won't you explain why all those children only have nightmares?
'Cause you were their nightmare.
You can persecute all the children in the world... but there's one thing you'll never have.
- What?
- A soul.
Because you believe you have one?
You don't even have a body.
He who created us made us all monsters.
No, Krank, you're wrong.
You are the only monster here.
Be quiet!
He's the only one responsible.
For that, l say l'm innocent. l'm innocent!
Anyway... l thank you for your help.
Hurry up! And don't break any of the baubles.
Well done.
And don't cut yourself.
Are you sure that we're doing the right thing?
Of course, my pet.
All children love it.
Lift your elbow.
Why worry, Krank? lf you're sincere. you have nothing to lose.
How are you, Marcello?
What's it to you?
We need you. Marcello, and your creepy-crawlies.
Have you still got the knack?
No, pIease, not again. l paid enough already.
- Nice place--
- You've got here. Marcello. l'm glad to see it hasn't changed much.
You know, l never liked that blue cage.
You were always so kind to us, Marcello.
- lt's only fair--
- That we look after you--
Today.
- A little girl in a red dress--
- With a big moron.
We want him.
And what do l do with her?
A midnight snack for the fishes.
Come on, my little flea.
There. there.
Easy does it.
Midnight snack for the fishes.
Will you shut up, you idiots?
- lt wasn't me.
- l don't care.
Work this out among yourselves.
How dare you hit the original.
You, the original?
Have you looked in the mirror lately?
Miette...
One will die?
You're born in the gutter.
You end up in the port.
Miette too little.
Not as little as all that.
Five thousand on the kid.
Ten thousand on the monster.
There are pebbles in the meat pie.
There are pebbles, bits of--
- Did you hear anything?
- Just them crazy birds.
- There's something over there.
- l don't see anything.
- Who is that guy there?
- What's all that monkey business?
Well, Brutus.
- l can't see anything now.
- Don't you like the music?
What you doing? l can't see. l don't want to be dead.
Jump! Go on! Jump!
Save Miette!
Hurry! Jump!
Found, West Pier. eve of St. John.
Oh, it's a miracle!
She's come to.
Spit!
Feel better? Look at me.
Are you alI right?
You're very lucky that l came by.
Haven't l seen you somewhere? l doubt it.
No one ever sees me. l'm always underwater.
Why? lt's dangerous up there.
- He wants to kill me.
- Who? l can't remember anything.
Some people lose their marbles.
And me, l've lost my memory. l'm glad you're here. l bring in more than enough stuff for two.
Look.
You see, l'm a treasure hunter.
The city's history is here.
Cast into the sea and forgotten forever.
- l see.
- l'm here, cataloging, dating.
Wait. That's the land shark's safe.
Oh, yes.
Yes, l brought it in yesterday.
And this is Vito Nine Fingers.
Everyone thought he ran away with his money.
They're wrong.
What are you doing? l stole them. l'm taking back what's mine.
Don't go back up there. lt's dangerous!
You're a kid.
Stay with me.
Well, thanks for everything, but l've got to go.
Not that way.
- The children.
- What about them? What do you know?
He takes them.
The devil takes them away... in his boat.
He takes them to hell.
- What hell?
- The Tattooed Man, he knows where.
The map.
The map of the minefield is tattooed on his body. lt's all my fault.
This man's a proper nutcase.
Holy cow, it's little brother again.
Miette.
Take care of him.
He's hopeless.
Sure.
What's the trouble, handsome?
There's no reason to be depressed.
- What?
- The girl--
Yes. The girl drowned. l wasn't going to resuscitate her.
- You should be twice as happy.
- Why are you sniffing?
Why l sniff? So what? l caught a cold at the pier.
- Gef ready in half an hour.
- ln a half hour?
Cyclops truck kidnap little brother.
Kidnap Denree.
Very funny.
What are you doing here?
Well, smarty, it wasn't nice of you to disappear. l'm sorry, but incredible things happened to One and me.
No kidding?
The Cyclops are stealing the chiIdren.
Yeah? And if you want to know, that doesn't seem to bother Mr. One.
He's picking up girls.
- Who says so?
- Pipo saw him.
- That night.
- ln the bar.
You're feeling a lot better already.
You can handle your liquor, a strong man like you.
That body. hard as a rock.
May l touch you?
Oh, wow!
Pretty nice. l don't like to brag. but they haven't failed me yet.
My little angel.
Little angel.
Life's a real bitch.
Feel better?
You're not cold?
You kidding?
You're a real radiator.
Radiator.
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Of course Miette!
You expecting Santa Claus?
When you're through being ridiculous, maybe we can talk.
Oh, well, there's no problem. l'll leave you.
See you later, Mr. One. l know where your brother is.
Why. you're absolutely smashed. lt's really you.
- But how did you manage to--
- You won't believe me.
Tell me about it.
- No, l have to take him back.
- He's too heavy.
See what state he's in? You won't be able to carry him all alone.
- Maybe you can help me.
- Me?
Yes, but for real this time. l'm embarrassed.
You know l didn't do it for money. l didn't betray you.
What's she doing?
Quick. run !
Go on. run !
They think you drowned.
Let them go on believing it.
We have to do something.
Lower him!
Get him!
Careful!
Great!
- A job well done.
- Trapped like a big, slobbering fish.
What's the matter?
What did he do to you?
- What did he do to you?
- You're inseparable.
- You must be in love.
- Think you're funny?
He's a grown-up, and you know it.
He may be big. but he's not grown up.
And maybe you're not so little either.
- Or you. or you.
- l am.
Okay, we get the message.
- See ya.
- Bye, Miette.
You'd better get going. lt'll soon get dark.
One?
You asleep?
What did you do before?
One sailor.
Harpooned whales.
One night...
One hear whales singing.
After... always the target l miss.
One loses job.
What's it like to have a little brother?
Keeps you... running.
Well, he can't complain he's got nobody to worry about him.
Denree-- little brother.
Miette-- little sister.
What are you doing?
Radiator.
Okay, Miette?
You had bad dream? l saw that woman again.
You know, who steals children.
There were huge balls in the port... full of spikes.
Mines?
The Taftooed Man knows where they've taken thea.
The map of the minefield is tatfooed on his body.
You were a sailor.
You should know about tattoos.
Big strong guy.
Kinda stupid.
Now that rings a bell-- with red hair.
- And hands like a baboon.
- He was supposed to deliver him.
We sent him the trumpet.
He brought it back empty.
- Nothing!
- But he took my sight, l swear!
Shut up!
- The beacons. Don't hurt them.
- Would we do that?
On the contrary.
Finish him.
Those sluts.
Always naggin' at me.
Boss?
- The boy ate your dinner.
- lt doesn't matter.
You were hungry, no doubt, my angel. Come closer.
No violence. Mishinka. After all, this young man is our guest.
The merciless burden of solitude.
And no one-- no one is spared.
Not even great minds.
And that shows... just how much l appreciate a visit... that's as spontaneous as yours. l'm glad l have no ears to hear such nonsense. lt's getting rather late for lrvin.
He becomes so tired. l'm sorry. Uncle lrvin.
Tell me... are you susceptible to the influence... of the fuIl moon?
And to the werewolf?
You're only sensitive to your nutritive urges.
You're not at all terrified of me.
You and l were made for each other.
You are the little boy that l need.
Let everyone know.
There.
Tattoo artist there.
Fifteenth one we've seen.
Hey, Cro-Magnon. slow down! l'm pooped.
For every step you take, l take three.
Tell me... after you've found your little brother. what'll you do?
Don't know.
Find work.
House.
One day... take wife, maybe.
Well. what kind of wife?
No hurry to choose.
Need time to find shoes One's size.
''Miette for life.''
Are you sure you don't remember?
He was a sailor who worked the minefields. You tattooed the map on him.
He will be most honored to answer your question.
What on Earth is that, Mama? lt can't be a submarine. lt's going through the mines. lt's the Messiah.
The Messiah has come to save us.
The Messiah walked on top of the water.
Two hands are better than one.
Hello, Miette.
Oh. no!
Don't say you've forgotten us.
Days and nights without news.
- We were beginning to worry about you.
- Don't bother.
We're never coming back.
Right, One?
Truer words were never said.
You'd better give us those jewels. quick.
Good work.
Very good.
Now we'll play a little tune for you in our own way.
A farewell tune.
All right?
He's killing her.
Will you keep quiet?
Shut up, l said!
WilI you shut up?
There's been an accident!
The two little brats got away, Zee.
But it's not over, is it?
They're hiding.
- And why are they hiding?
- Because they don't want to play.
So that's why they hide.
Why, it's you, my little flea.
Tell me where you've been.
How horrible.
What's the Octopus doing?
Scratch.
Go on.
Be careful.
- You got stung, you bitch !
- Bitch!
Bitch yourself!
Die!
Let go!
You're hurting me!
Die, you crazy witch!
- Why must you look like me?
- That's not true! l don't look like you! lt's you who looks like me!
You old hag! l'm going to kill you! l'll kill you first!
- l'll tear your nose off!
- Die! lf l die. you die too!
Think you can live forever.
Always better than anyone else.
You ugly old bitch!
Not a migraine tonight. l want you in impeccable condition.
Your concern is really touching.
Has the boy put you into such good spirits?
A perfect specimen that is totally uninhibited.
Tonight is my last chance.
What is it?
The thing is here, Mama. ln the house.
What do we do now?
Don't you panic!
Are you men?
Yes or no?
No.
Well, that's enough! lnspection and report!
The explosives!
They've disappeared. lt came from there.
There must be a passage.
Too small.
Mouse hole. lt's worth a try. l'm off.
We're really starting to get attached.
Concentrate on my voice, Krank.
You're sinking into sleep.
You're falling into a void.
Always deeper.
Together, we shall open a door.
Please don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.
Good-bye. grasshopper.
- You, Professor.
- There's no more professor, Martha.
Just a terrible mistake. lt must be erased.
Say, l recognize you.
So, little crayfish, huh?
You fell into a strange net. huh?
Run.
Run before it's too late.
- Does it hurt?
- Yes. l'm allergic to steel. lt's nothing. He'll erase everything. like a mistake, you see.
He explained it to me.
You'll feel better after.
Yes. He really knows.
- He's the original.
- What are you doing?
- l found him.
- Who?
There.
- The original.
- The original?
- Quite a shock, no?
- The original.
That's the original.
But l'm the original. lt's me!
- No, l'm the original.
- Smell that.
33% sodium nitrate,
20 glycerine carbonate and S02.
Very strange. You remind me of someone. All of you.
Well. come on.
- Back to work, huh?
- Hey! And the kids?
- You've forgotten?
- Of course! The little children. l came for them. l even brought them this.
And this.
Give them back to them, huh?
Come on! Let's go!
Please, help me!
Which is the way out?
Miss?
Miss?
The passage there.
Take the key. Here.
But don't hurt him.
Go save the children.
Here you are at last. l've been waiting so long. ls someone there? l'm the one speaking. ln the fish tank.
Come closer.
Don't be afraid. lt's you who's speaking, mister?
The mines.
The oil rig in your dream.
Remember?
That was my message.
Don't try to trick me, too, mister.
Get up, little brother.
We have to go.
- Wake up, now.
- Oh. no! You'll kill him!
He's under a spell.
There's only one way.
Go find the child where he is-- in the clutches of evil. lnside the dream.
Look, no hands! l don't believe this.
What am l doing here?
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right. lf you say so. mister. lt's funny. l don't even know the little brother.
But l know you.
The little brother could have been yours.
Don't be afraid.
Just relax.
Now. close your eyes. listen to my voice... and sleep.
Be brave. little girl.
Who are you?
Why are you in my dream?
- Why is it his dream?
- Because he's not afraid of me.
Please let me take his place.
What would you get in exchange?
A brother. lf l take his place, maybe l'll see his big brother again.
You are trying to trap me, aren't you?
You don't risk very much.
So be it.
Well, my chickadee, huh?
Sometimes it's better to land in the muck, huh?
Hey, you'd better get out of this place. lt's going sky-high! l had a weird dream. l was very, very old.
And you were dead.
The void equals infinity!
Oh, no, Uncle!
Heave, ho!
Row faster, guys! lt's following us!
What do you mean, following us?
Untie the bowlines, idiots.
Come back! lt's me!
Your creator! l made you ! l gave you life! lrvin ! You hear me? l order you to come back!
More blood!
Great. Keep coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.
Don't be stingy.
Watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.
Chase, keep that claw really moving.
Jeffrey, jam it on there just like Freddy would.
Good, good. And cut!
Print that, Gretchen.
Chase, you're a genius.
This makes his old claw look like Mother Teresa's mitten.
You better thank them.
They're very sensitive.
Chuck, Terry, great blood.
- Thank you very much.
- Some of our best work.
Hey, monkey man, want to see some neat stuff?
Come on.
It's only make-Believe.
Marianne, I gotta go.
Low bridge.
Let's see if we can scare the P.J.'S off Mommy.
Hey, Heather.
You hungry, Dylan?
Gotcha.
It should have flexed more.
I think the servos got shorted out with blood.
Well, take it apart, pull it out... and insulate them with some styro.
The thing wasn't meant to be submerged, for Pete's sake.
I don't like that thing.
That thing puts bread on our table.
Is it alive, Daddy?
Heather, you're in the next shot.
State-Of-The-Art animatronics with bio-Organic grafting.
Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a live Doberman.
Must've have picked up a signal from an eighties walkie-talkie.
- Sure it's off?
- It's off.
Funny, it's warm... just like a real hand.
Oh, God.
What the hell's going on here?
Cut the effects!
Terry, where is it? Terry!
Chuck, get off me!
Heather, where is it?
Chase, where the hell is it?
Come on.
What the fuck?!
Earthquake. Come on.
Mommy!
What is that?
Car alarms.
You OK?
You OK, chief?
Honey, do you have a fever?
Just another earthquake, Dylan.
Getting kind of fun, huh?
Daddy. Blood.
It's nothing, guys.
It's a scratch. Really.
Where did you get that?
I don't know. Picture, I guess.
When it fell. It's no big deal.
Put a bandage on it.
Don't worry about it.
Geologists at Cal Tech... have confirmed this morning's aftershock...
Do we have to watch that?
...five-point-three on the Richter scale.
Thought you turned it on.
It was strong enough to cause further collapse... of the already badly damaged parking structure...
I'll turn it off.
Officials say that this is normal... following a quake of last week's magnitude... now thought to be a massive 6.8.
Dylan, this is breakfast, not arts and crafts.
What?
Did you get any sleep last night?
More or less.
OK, time to get dressed.
I'm late.
You going away?
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.
Is there anything other than the obvious bothering you?
I think five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another phone call, has there?
Good sign.
Two full weeks without him.
Maybe he got hit by a truck.
He's closer, if anything.
It's giving me nightmares,
Chase.
Did you have one last night?
It's just the earthquakes,
Heather.
Maybe.
Maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No. You gotta get back on the horse sometime.
Look, you had a nut case making harassing phone calls.
I know how scary that's been.
No, you don't.
OK, I don't.
But it doesn't mean that it can't be over.
But what if it isn't over?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
It was nothing. I was... you and I were working on this movie, together for once... and one of your special effects went really wrong.
And Chuck and Terry got hurt... and... well, your fingers were cut.
Right here?
Heather, you were probably half awake... and saw my fingers get nicked when the mirror fell.
Dreams are like that.
Look, if you don't want me to go on this job, I won't.
Just be careful, OK?
I think I can survive two days in Palm Springs... supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial.
I guess so.
You guess so?
Come here.
Forty-eight hours.
I'll be back in no time.
I gotta go.
I love what you've done with the place.
Knock 'em dead.
Dylan, I gotta go.
Take care of Mommy.
Nancy.
Dylan, I don't want you watching this.
Dylan, what's wrong?
What's wrong?!
What's happening to you?
One, two...
Freddy's coming for you!
Someone's coming.
What?
Are you OK, honey?
Is everything OK?
It's just these quakes.
Did you feel one just now?
No. A big truck went by before you opened the door.
It's life on the fault line.
- Hey, tiger.
- Hi, Julie.
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning.
No, he seems OK.
Are you sure that's all that's wrong?
Leave us alone, you son of a bitch!
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.
Just wanted you to know
I'm out front.
I'm sorry.
Can you hang on a minute?
What is it?
I don't know.
I just have this weird feeling today.
Mommy? Stay home, then.
This damn caller.
He's started again?
Sick fuck.
Sorry.
Dylan doesn't seem to have a fever.
It's probably just your nerves.
Nerves?
I just meant from the shaker this morning.
Everybody's freaked out about how many we've been having.
And then these phone calls.
Don't answer it.
Excuse me, ma'am, but we are going to be late.
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?
Bye.
I'll call the cops for you.
You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Give them the time they called... and they're keeping this list, supposedly.
Julie, I'm really sorry.
My nerves are a little raw these days.
It's OK.
Yeah. I gotta go.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
You played that girl.
In that movie.
With the guy with the...
Yeah, sure. That's you.
That's what I love about this job.
I get to meet the stars.
I'm hardly a star.
What, are you kidding?
I love your stuff.
The first was the best.
Where the girlfriend's cut open and dragged across the ceiling.
It was awesome.
And when all that blood comes out of your boyfriend's bed?
I thought I'd shit.
But they never should have killed off Freddy.
Heather, look, we gotta go.
Cutting it close, aren't you?
You trying to get me fired?
OK! We're coming!
So, Heather, we're approaching the tenth anniversary... of this whole
"Nightmare on Elm Street" thing.
I mean, the original, five very popular sequels.
How has all the success affected you personally?
I don't know if it really has, Sam.
God. With the exception of One and Three...
I pretty much stayed out of it.
Well, I'm doing a lot more television now... so those hours let me spend a lot more time... with my husband and my little boy.
You have a little boy.
What's his name?
Dylan.
With Dylan, does that change your feeling... your perspective about horror movies?
No, not really.
Would you let him see one of your movies?
My son? No.
I'm sure people ask you this all the time...
Is there going to be another sequel... and what's more, is Freddy really dead?
Of course he is.
Freddy's dead and gone.
And how about your co-Star in the original... would you trust him alone with Dylan?
Robert? I don't know.
Why don't we ask him how he'd feel about it?
We've got a big surprise for you and for our audience.
Let's bring him out.
He is the best of the bad.
Let's say hello to Robert Englund.
Love ya, babe!
We'll do lunch!
I'm alive once again!
Freddy's back! Give it up for your Uncle Freddy!
Just when you thought it was safe to get back into bed!
Give me five!
I'm back, and I'm badder than ever!
You are all my children now!
I got to go, Robert.
Just a second. I'll walk you.
There you go, kids.
- Thank you.
- Bye-Bye.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
Well, everything went great,
I thought.
We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me.
Come on. They loved the expression on your face.
I think they'd like to see us together again.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Just because it's a love story... doesn't mean you can't have a decapitation or two.
- There's a call for you.
- For me?
I'll talk to you later.
Heather, it's Sara Risher over at New Line Cinema.
How are you?
How are you?
This is a voice from the past.
It sure is.
Listen, Heather,
I won't take but a minute.
It's just that we have something to propose to you... and I wonder if you'd stop by the offices.
Bob would love to talk to you.
Sure. When?
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.
- Now?
-Just take a minute.
You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Bye.
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Bob Shaye.
Was Bob expecting you?
Sara. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Great to see you.
- You look great.
- Thank you.
Bob is dying to see you.
Can I get you something?
- Coffee would be fine.
- Black?
- Black's fine.
- Could you get us some coffee?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
I think the guy is a little bit of a jerk... but we won't know until we've read the script.
Anyhow, I'll give you a call when I...
Listen, man, I got to go.
Call me when you get to Milan... and don't forget... risotto con tartufi.
It's fantastico!
Take care, man.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Boy, do you look great, Heather.
- How are you?
- Great. I'm fine.
And I don't have to ask how you're doing.
Well, so far so good.
Which is why we asked you to come by today.
- Thanks, Kim.
- Sure.
Look, Heather, let me cut to the chase.
How would you like to join us in the definitive "Nightmare"?
I thought you killed Freddy off.
Well, we did, but the fans...
God bless them, they're clamouring for more.
I guess evil never dies, right?
Anyhow, a few weeks ago,
I got a call from Wes... and he pitched me this really ex citing idea... and I started thinking...
"who better to resurrect
Freddy than his creator?"
I thought Wes stopped doing horror movies.
He actually told me he hadn't called in the last ten years... because he hadn't had any really scary nightmares.
They're his inspiration for this thing.
Anyhow, he's right in the middle of the script.
Which means he's having nightmares again.
He's very excited about it.
- The nightmares?
- No, the script.
And you should be, too, because you're the star.
I don't know, Bob.
I'm flattered, really, but I have a kid now.
Well, so?
So I'm not sure about doing horror.
Come on, Heather.
Kids love horror.
Thank you so much, Bob.
I have other things happening.
Look, we'll match any offer that's on the table for you.
No, it's not that.
Look, I have a fan.
Heather, you got plenty of fans.
We've been doing marketing research on you.
You are rating right up there.
We've got Chase working on a prototype for the new glove.
What?
We asked him to kind of keep it as a surprise... until you and I could have this conversation.
How long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't know.
A couple of months. Why?
And since you've been thinking of making it... has anything funny happened?
What do you mean?
Like weird phone calls.
Or nightmares.
Why don't you answer your phone, Bob?
That's what we got people we pay around here for.
Will someone pick up the damn phone?
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
What the...
Never sleep again.
What is going on?
You didn't let him watch the movie on TV, did you?
Movie? He didn't watch anything on TV.
He was taking his nap, and I heard him screaming.
Honey, are you OK?
Rex saved me.
He did?
Is Rex going to die?
Rex is not going to die.
I promise you, sweetie.
Do you know where the sewing stuff is in the kitchen?
Sure.
We'll do an operation, OK?
Come on.
Dr Dylan and Dr Julie.
Fix him up good as new, OK?
Hey, Chase. You've got a call.
It's your wife.
Chase, you better come home.
Heather, I'm stuck here.
Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.
Why? What's the matter?
- Chase, it's Dylan.
- What?
Hold on.
The phone's breaking up.
What's going on with Dylan?
He's had some sort of an episode.
What?
What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strangely.
Like somebody was after him.
It's scary. It scared me.
He was acting like...
Like what?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another phone call?
Why didn't you tell me you were working on a new glove?
And why aren't Chuck and Terry at work today?
Forget those clowns. Answer me.
Has there been another phone call today or not?
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.
- Danny, I got to go.
- What's up?
My kid's sick. I got to fly.
"As soon as the sun was up...
"the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.
"'We will bake cookies first,' she said.
"'I've heated the oven and kneaded the dough.
"'Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.'
"And she pushed Gretel toward the oven.
"The witch went to shut the door and bake her inside."
This is so violent.
I don't know why you like these stupid old fairy tales.
Finish, please.
- They'll give you nightmares.
- I like this story.
"But Gretel guessed what the witch was planning.
"'I don't know how to get in,' Gretel said.
"'How am I to manage it?'
"'Stupid girl,' shouted the witch, rushing to the oven.
"'The opening is big enough.
See? I can fit myself. '
"Quickly, Gretel came behind and pushed with all her might...
"plunging the wicked old woman headlong into the flames...
"banging the door shut and bolting it tight.
"The witch howled..."
That's enough.
"The witch howled like a scalded cat...
"but Gretel ran and left her there to perish nonetheless.
"She ran to her brother as fast as she could...
"flung open the door.
'Hansel! Hansel,' she cried.
"We're saved!
The witch is dead."
Time for sleep.
Say how they find their way back home.
- Tomorrow night.
- No. Tonight.
It's important.
Dylan, you know as well as I do.
They followed the trail of breadcrumbs back to their house.
And then their father covered them with kisses... and they were safe.
They were safe, and they could sleep.
- What is that?
- Rex.
Come on.
Rex keeps him down there.
Who?
The mean old man with the claws.
He wants to come up while we sleep.
I keep my feet up here.
Rex keeps him down there.
He's my guard.
You should have a guard, too.
There's nothing down there.
Come here.
Look. See?
It's different when you're gone.
Come on.
On, please.
OK, sweetie.
Night-Night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- Daddy coming home?
- He's on his way.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Right.
If the birds don't eat them first.
Perfect, perfect, perfect!
Come on, come on, come on.
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot
Light
Light
Losin' my
Religion
Mommy's scared?
Dylan, Mommy's fine.
It was just a bad dream.
What are you doing out of bed?
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting.
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.
I'm not sleepy.
Police, ma'am.
Will you open the door?
Heather Langenkamp?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
There was an accident.
It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
Is he... I mean...
Is he hurt?
I'm afraid it's worse than that, ma'am.
Is he dead?
Yes, ma'am.
Are you sure it's him?
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.
I want to see his body.
No, you don't, ma'am.
It's not necessary.
I want to see it for myself.
- Can you hand me that?
- Sure.
Excuse me.
- Could I help you?
- Porter.
Chase Porter.
It's back here.
You said Chase?
I'm sorry.
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.
I'd like to see once again.
I'm sorry?
Could you lift the sheet again, please?
More, please.
What is that?
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.
The head's gonna be all right for the funeral, but...
Hey, lady. You OK?
You sure?
Oh, God. What did that?
They said the truck was tore up something awful... so you can imagine him not being in... well, exactly top shape.
It looks like he was clawed.
That's why we don't lift the sheet past the face, ma'am.
Sometimes it's what we don't see that gets us through the night.
So, if you'll just sign...
God is our hope and strength... a very present help in trouble.
Therefore, we will not fear... though the earth be moved... and though the hills be carried... into the midst of the sea... though the waters thereof rage and swell... and though the mountains shake... at the tempest of the same.
-Julie, where's Dylan?
- I don't know.
Dylan, grab Mommy's hand.
Grab it!
Oh, my God!
Hurry!
Let go of me!
Stay with me.
Stay with me, Heather.
- Where's Dylan?
- He's all right.
He's right here.
- What happened?
- Earthquake.
You got knocked off your feet.
You got a pretty good bump, actually.
May he rest in peace, children.
And may you all get home safely.
Amen.
If there's anything
I can do, Heather... anything.
Thank you, Robert.
Sweetie.
Tina?
Who are you?
Baby, wake up.
Honey. Dylan.
Dylan, get over here!
Honey! Honey!
Come on.
OK, sugar, we're gonna go back to bed now.
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.
Honey, you have to sleep.
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Where did you hear that?
Did you hear that on that movie?
Did you answer the phone?
Dylan, where did you hear that song?
In my bed.
In your bed?
Under my covers. Kids singing.
Way down there with the man.
The mean man.
What is that man doing?
Trying to get up.
Trying to get up into our world.
Where's Daddy now?
Daddy's in heaven.
He's with God now.
Do you have to die to see God?
I don't think so.
I think you have to pray.
And reach out.
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know, honey.
Please try to get some sleep.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
I think that only happens in the movies.
But I'll always, always... be right here when you get back.
And I'll make sure that nobody gets your toes.
I know his behaviour is bizarre... but he's usually so normal and well adjusted, John...
I can't believe it's him... and not something outside influencing him.
Or is that how denial works?
It is denial.
I don't think that's the case here.
If you're really worried about Dylan... have a doctor check him out.
You'll see. Everything's fine.
You're not just saying that to help a crazy friend cope?
Everything about Dylan's behaviour is understandable... for a kid who just lost his father.
How does a child process a thing like that?
I don't know.
I've not been able to process it very well myself.
And you're not crazy, by the way.
Seeing Freddy in that grave and then jumping in... you didn't jump in.
That's my memory.
It seemed absolutely real.
"Seemed," not "was."
It's in my family, you know.
What is?
A very close relative died in an institution.
Really? If having a screwy family made a person crazy... the whole world would be one big loony bin.
You have a crazed fan after you.
That's what's making you crazy.
Probably Dylan, too.
I never mentioned that to him.
Kids know when something's bugging the parent.
You have no idea who this is calling?
- Freddy, for all I know.
- Come on.
He's a man.
Or a boy with a deep Freddy voice.
Six weeks, and you're surprised you got Freddy in your dreams?
Hell, Sonny Bono, after a while... began seeing his stalker everywhere, even at Mass.
Really?
How many times did Letterman call the cops... thinking that woman was down in the kitchen again?
Really gets under your skin if you let it.
You really think Dylan's OK?
Dylan's fine. You're fine.
You're hurting, but you're fine... and you're definitely not crazy.
My worst fear... that whatever madness is in my family I have... and I've passed it onto Dylan.
- Make sure he's OK, John.
- Are you all right?
Are you OK? Are you sure?
Does anything hurt?
Dylan, are you all right?
Honey, are you all right?
Are you sure?
God wouldn't take me.
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.
It's unbelievable.
- You doing all right?
- Hanging in there.
You know the guy that was calling me all the time?
He started again... and he's putting stuff in my mail again.
Listen, the S.O.B. Probably read about the funeral... in the papers or something.
Sick mother.
That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.
Wait a second.
Now, let me get this straight.
You're having nightmares about Freddy? As in me?
No. It isn't you. He's scarier.
He's...
Darker?
More evil?
Yeah. How did you know?
Call it a guess.
Pretty damn good guess.
Anyway what I was calling about was... have you seen any of the script by any chance?
No. Wes won't show it until he's finished.
At least that's what he told me.
When is it gonna be done?
The way he's writing, who knows?
It's so weird.
I asked him how far he was at the funeral.
What did he say? Oh, yeah.
"As far as Dylan trying to reach God."
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?
Putting your kid in the script.
Robert... have you been having nightmares?
Look, we need to talk, but not over the phone.
Can I come over?
Actually, Heather... today's no good.
There's something
I have to finish.
Tomorrow maybe, huh?
OK, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.
And meanwhile, Robert, take care, OK?
Yeah. Sure.
Damn it!
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, grab your crucifix
Seven, eight, better stay up late
Dylan, don't sing that song.
Nine, ten, never sleep again!
Dylan! Stop it!
No! Don't!
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
I touched him.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Diabetes?
Was there a trigger event, trauma, shock?
You haven't shown him the films you've made, have you?
The horror stuff?
His father just passed away.
I'm sorry.
But I'm convinced those films can tip... an unstable child over the edge.
Unstable?
Dylan's not unstable.
He's just upset.
We'll run a battery of tests and know in a few days.
Does he have to stay overnight?
Absolutely.
Anything more happen we need to know about?
Like what?
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes... will give a clue to what ails him.
Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
What do we have here?
Too soon to know for sure.
The early symptoms point to childhood schizophrenia.
Dylan, can you hear me?
Dylan, you have to fight it, whatever is after you... and you got to come back to me.
You can't make it alone.
Do you hear?
If you can hear me, tell me what you need to feel safe.
Rex? Is that what you want?
Well, Rex is at home, and that's where you should be.
But you got to get better before they'll let you come home.
Do you understand?
Home.
Home. Home, that's right.
That's where I want you, sweetie.
And, you know, we're not that far away.
Look right out there.
Past the freeway is our home.
But to get there, you have to come out from where you are... so that they'll let you come home to Rex.
And to me.
Time for your medicine, cowboy.
- Here you go.
- What is that?
Something to help him sleep.
There you go. It looks good.
There you go.
Good. Good. Attaboy.
Come on, lie down and take a little nap.
You should get some rest, too.
He's going to be fine.
We're gonna do some tests... and then you can come back later.
Can you get that other side, please?
I grabbed his things.
These are his favourite pyjamas here.
Honey, I've got to go.
I love you, Dylan.
Remember what I said.
We'll take care of everything.
Wake up, lady!
Don't lose it now!
Seismologists at Cal Tech... have counted over 300 temblors so far.
Though most were too faint for us to feel... seven have shaken our community in the last few weeks... and now scientists are speculating... there might be an unknown fault running beneath Los Angeles... a fault that could...
Hi. You've reached the Englund residence.
We're out of town.
You can leave a message if you wish, but... we'll be gone for some time.
I wish I could tell you where the script was going.
The fact is I don't know.
I dream a scene at night,
I write it down in the morning.
Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine where it's going.
At least tell me what it's about so far.
- Coffee.
- Thanks.
I can tell you what the nightmare's about so far.
It's about this entity... whatever you want to call it.
It's old. It's very old.
It's existed in different forms in different times.
The only thing that stays the same is what it lives for.
What is that?
The murder of innocents.
This is still a script we're talking about, right, Wes?
I sort of think of it as a nightmare in progress.
In this nightmare in progress... does this thing have any weaknesses?
It can be captured sometimes.
Captured? How?
By storytellers, of all things.
Every so often, they imagine a story good enough... to sort of catch its essence.
Then, for a while, it's held prisoner in the story.
- Like the genie in the bottle.
- Exactly.
But the problem comes when the story dies.
And that can happen in a lot of ways.
It can get too familiar... or somebody waters it down to make it an easier sell... or maybe it's so upsetting that it's banned outright.
However it happens, when the story dies... the evil is set free.
You're saying Freddy is this ancient thing?
Right. The current version.
And for ten years, he's been held captive as Freddy... in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, but... now that the films have ended, the genie's out of the bottle.
That's what the nightmares are telling me and I'm writing.
If Freddy's loose in your script, where's he going?
Another age? Another form?
No, that's not what the dreams have him doing.
What is he doing?
He's sort of gotten used to being Freddy now... and he likes our time and space... so he's decided to cross over out of films into our reality.
Isn't there somebody who can stop him?
Actually there is a person in the dream... sort of a gatekeeper, so to speak.
Somebody Freddy has to get by... before he can come into our world.
That person's you, Heather.
It's me?
Why me?
Dramatically speaking, it makes perfect sense.
You played Nancy, after all.
You were the first to humiliate him, defeat him.
That was Nancy. Not me.
But you gave Nancy her strength.
So in order to get out, he's got to come through you.
He's gonna try to do that at your most vulnerable points.
Oh, my God, Wes.
Did you know?
It was a script.
It was a dream.
I didn't know.
You know damn well it's more than that now.
How can we stop him?
The only way is to make another movie.
I swear, I'm gonna stay by this computer... and keep writing until I finish the script, but... when that time comes, you'll have to make a choice.
Choice?
What kind of choice?
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
"Many of the symptoms of childhood schizophrenia...
"are duplicated in children...
"suffering from sleep deprivation."
"Sleep deprivation can produce trance-Like states...
"mechanical behaviour.
"The child might..."
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting the mean old man with the claws.
You have no idea who this is calling?
Freddy, for all I know.
As in me?
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.
Darker, more evil?
How did you know?
He's decided to cross over, out of films, into our reality.
Never sleep again.
The world of horror films suffered its own terror today... as two of Hollywood's best known special-Effects technicians... were found dead in a vacant field.
Terrance Feinstein and Charles Wilson... two special-effects artists... reputedly working on a top-Secret project... for the makers of the Freddy Krueger films... were found brutally slashed to death early this morning.
Freddy's glove was missing... and police are speculating the murders were the result... of a botched theft... which apparently took place two days ago.
At this point, the murder weapon has not...
Oh, God.
Miss me?
Nancy.
There are no visiting hours this late.
You must understand.
No, I don't understand.
I told you I'm his baby-sitter.
I'm a close friend of the family, damn it.
I just need to see him for a minute.
Sixty seconds. Come on.
You have to understand.
You can't see him.
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I had this really terrible dream about Dylan.
I had to come and see him.
You must think I'm crazy.
No, I don't.
Is he all right?
I don't know.
They wouldn't let me in.
There are no evening visiting hours in intensive care.
Is he all right?
Dylan? He's holding well.
Earlier he had some problems.
- He's in an oxygen tent now.
- Oh, my God.
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp. May I?
Those are nasty cuts.
How did you get them?
It happened in the earthquake.
I fell.
I need to see Dylan.
In a moment.
First let's see about you.
If these had been a few inches nearer the wrist... what did you say you cut yourself on?
It was the earthquake.
It was dark. I have no idea.
But these look quite fresh.
They are. It happened in tonight's earthquake.
It happened just 15 minutes ago.
You must have felt it.
Guess we lucked out over here.
Your son... is apparently terrified of a man... someone he thinks is going to come out of his bed.
One of the nurses heard him talking to himself.
Do you have any idea who that man is?
I forgot to bring his dinosaur Rex.
He keeps Freddy from coming up out of his... bed.
The man from your films?
Freddy Krueger?
With the claws?
Is that who he's afraid of?
You have let your child see your films, haven't you?
Every kid knows who Freddy is.
He's like Santa Claus... or King Kong or... well, interesting talking with you, Miss Langenkamp.
I hope you understand.
My concerns are simply for the welfare of your son.
How's he doing?
Honey.
- You shouldn't do that.
- Too late.
I'm almost there, Heather.
Almost there.
Daddy!
- Doctor!
- Keep her right there.
We can't hold him much longer.
Get the full anaesthetic, stat.
We don't have that here.
No anaesthetic, you say?
Screw it. I'm going in.
Little booger's full of something I don't like.
Let's get him open, good and proper.
Cut this evil out of him.
- Gloria!
- He's got my baby!
- Who?
- Freddy!
Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?
- What the hell's going on?
- My baby!
Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.
I suggest you go home and get some rest.
Your son is fine.
He's downstairs for further testing.
But he was just here.
He was here, you fell asleep, we took him.
You looked so exhausted... frankly, we didn't want to wake you.
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.
That's his baby-Sitter, right?
Believe me. Everything is fine.
Everything's not fine.
Damn!
Call security.
Security, code yellow.
Pediatric testing.
This is a restricted area.
Do you have a pass?
Screw your pass.
It's all right.
Where is he?
Just stay calm.
How's her little boy doing?
He's fine, actually.
He came around about ten minutes ago.
He seems to be suffering from acute sleep deprivation.
I don't think she ever lets him sleep.
What are you saying?
Where is he?
I've got someone here who wants to see you.
Are you OK, champ?
Can we go get Rex now?
The bad man's getting awful close.
I know he is.
We're gonna go get Rex right now.
I'm afraid Dylan should stay here until we know... what's causing these episodes.
I'm sure you understand.
Good.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go home and get Rex right now.
You know that home isn't far from here, right?
Right across the freeway.
That's right.
I won't be gone long... and Julie's gonna stay here with you.
Yeah, you bet.
Hurry up, please. I'm sleepy.
I promise. Cross my heart.
But, Dylan... until Mommy gets back... whatever you do... don't fall asleep.
Julie, don't let him out of your sight.
What's going on?
Your hair's turning grey.
Julie, keep him awake.
Understand?
Excuse me, miss.
Would you come with us?
What? Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off me!
Do you mind?
What the hell is this?
Just a quick word... for Dylan's sake.
We've had an ex citing day, haven't we?
This one?
Right there.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
You won.
Would you mind stepping outside for one moment?
As a matter of fact, I would.
What are you doing?
It's just a little shot to see that he sleeps.
No. His mother specifically said...
- I said no.
- Do it.
All done.
He'll be asleep soon.
- Would you let go of my arm?
- You bitch!
Hey, you can't do that!
I know what's in that one.
Do you know what's in this one?
Or what's gonna happen to you when I stick you with it?
And I will.
I want you to stay awake, OK?
Keep your eyes open for me.
Come on.
Has there been any use of recreational drugs... in your family?
Or any history of mental disturbance?
What are you asking?
Please, don't take it wrong.
If there was, there's a good chance...
Dylan could be suffering from something passed down to him.
Have you been suffering from any delusional events?
This man from your films...
Freddy Krueger.
Have you been seeing him?
Would you get those keys down here?
I want you to stay awake.
Keep your eyes open for me.
Where's Mommy?
She'll be back. Now stay awake.
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.
We could... put Dylan in foster care for a short while.
Just long enough to run some tests on you.
Keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, OK?
Come on. You can stay awake.
Stay awake for me.
I want you to stay awake.
Keep your eyes open.
Dylan, what's the matter?
Julie, behind you.
There's nothing there.
Dylan, what's wrong?
Dylan, stop it.
You're scaring me.
I want my son out of here right now.
Very well.
As soon as we can gather the appropriate papers.
You don't understand.
If Dylan falls asleep, then...
I got it.
Dylan, get out of here!
Ever play skin the cat?
Come on.
Help me.
Mom!
Rex!
What the hell's going on?
You can't go in there. No.
Wait, wait.
Code yellow to paediatric testing.
Where's my son?!
Where is he?!
Have you seen my son?
He was just here.
The boy.
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
- What?
- He sleepwalks, you idiot.
He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.
Oh, shit.
John, it's Heather.
I need your help.
Why? What happened?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.
I don't know if he's wandering or headed for the house... but I think Freddy's after him.
I know that sounds crazy, but... you're right. That sounds crazy.
Oh, my God.
You know that home isn't far from here, right?
Right across the freeway.
Krueger, you bastard!
Take me!
Are you OK?
You OK?
My son is out here!
Let me go! Dylan!
I'm sorry. What happened to you?
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?
Take it easy, take it easy.
Relax. He's right there.
What happened?
Oh, God.
What's going on, Heather?
What in the world happened?
I know how Chase really died.
- What do you mean?
- Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah. Sure.
You saw him, didn't you?
Coming for you
Nancy, let's go outside.
He'll be all right.
I'll be right back.
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?
Why are you calling me Nancy,
John?
Why are you calling me John?
Nancy, pull yourself together... before you make yourself and that kid nuts.
Would you call Robert?
Robert Englund.
- The guy who plays Freddy.
- Freddy who?
Freddy Krueger.
Nancy, Freddy's dead.
Don't start losing it like your mother did.
I love you, sweetheart.
Don't forget that.
I love you, too...
Daddy.
Get yourself some rest,
Nancy, please.
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Who's there?
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.
I'm gonna get the guy who did it... and I want you to arrest him when I bring him out, OK?
Nancy, just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.
Yeah, sure.
Dylan's sleeping pills.
Say how they find their way back home.
It's important.
Breadcrumbs.
Too late, Heather.
Too late.
Join you.
You've given me a way to join you.
Almost there.
"The more she read, the more she realized...
"what she had in her hands was nothing more or less...
"than her life itself.
"That everything she had experienced and thought...
"was bound within these pages."
"There was no movie.
"There was only... her life."
It's just me.
Are you OK? Are you all right?
Where's the man?
I don't know.
He had me, but then he let me go.
Meet your maker.
Pick a pet for the rugrat, bitch.
Fuck you!
Get over there, Dylan!
Take this!
Come here, my piggy.
I got some gingerbread for you.
Gotcha!
Where's your mommy, piglet, huh, huh?
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!
Come to papa.
Gonna eat you up.
Leave him alone!
Dylan, get out of there!
Push!
Run!
Are you OK?
Honey, honey.
Oh, my God.
We're saved. The witch is dead.
And his mother covered him with kisses, and they were safe.
"Heather...
"thanks for having the guts to play Nancy one last time.
"At last Freddy's back where he belongs.
"Regards, Wes."
Is it a story?
Yeah. It's a story.
Read me some.
"We open on an old wooden bench.
"There's fire and tools...
"and a man's grimy hands...
"building what soon is revealed as a gleaming set of claws.
"And the claws are moving now...
"as if awakening from a long and unwanted sleep.
"Then the man lays one trembling hand flat upon the table...
"and with his other picks up a thick, sharp blade.
"Behind the lights, faces watch from the darkness...
"ready to laugh or scream in terror."
Listen up, 'cause
I'm only tellin' you this once.
I'm not a bedtime story lady, so pay attention.
It's 2033.
The world is screwed now.
You see, a while ago, this humongous comet came crashing into the Earth.
Bam!
Total devastation.
End of the world as we know it.
No celebrities, no cable TV, no water.
It hasn't rained in 11 years.
Now, 20 people gotta squeeze inside the same bathtub.
So, it ain't all bad.
That's me... the one in the mask.
No, the other one in the mask.
Today's my boyfriend's birthday.
So, I'm out shopping for that perfect gift... whatever I can scrounge up.
Uh-oh, Ripper leftovers.
The Rippers are a demonic army of bloodthirsty, human eating, purse snatching, mutant creatures.
Witness exhibit A.
Uchh!, you are so dead.
They're led by the infamous
Johnny Prophet.
They spend most of their time raidin' the WP.
That's short for Water and Power.
They control most of the water and got all the power.
Oh, wait, one last thing.
My friends and me, we do not suck up to Water and Power.
Yeah, we steal water, but as long as they don't find out, who gives a shit?
Ah, there it is... home sweet home.
A thing of beauty.
I'm gonna go water the vegetables.
Hey, Town, you fixed the pump, right?
I'm going down.
Yeah, go for it.
Shit.
You've been stealing water.
What gave you that idea?
Take off your clothes.
Ohh, agh!
- Now!
- Shit.
Right, right, right, right...
There.
Did I tell you to stop?
Ohh.
Now...
Salute me.
I'm not too good under pressure.
Well, you'll learn then, won't you?
Gross out.
Come on, they're being weird again.
Let's get outta here.
Let go.
Damn!
Hah, I was just gettin' into that one.
Give me that.
Hey, Sam.
I thought you was working on my Doris Day bust.
I didn't trade you my specially autographed Doris picture just for whatever this is.
I know, but the wood talks to me.
It said, "Ripper. "
How would you know what one looks like?
No one's ever seen a Ripper.
No one's ever seen your peanut dick either.
- I'm tellin'.
- Go ahead.
Rebecca, don't forget guard duty.
Ah.
Adam was dust until God injected him with life.
And do you know what was in that injection?
Water.
Water is life.
Water is power.
Well done.
You've all done a masterful job.
Ninety-five percent of the desert and all the water it contains now belongs to Water and Power.
Well, I think that deserves a little toast.
To Captain Derouche for securing most of the desert.
Captain Derouche.
Captain Derouche.
I can promise you, sir, the Rippers will only be a minor setback.
Hmm.
Once I take care of them, that final crack of land will be ours.
This crack of land, Captain?
Hm, hm, well, just a small crack.
Doesn't matter, we'll let that go.
Hmm.
Oh, my.
Now look what's happened.
We lost the Feta Plains.
And the Tenelson Ridge.
And so on!
There are three million liters of water underneath the Blue Dunes.
And you will retrieve it.
Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir.
Good!
Remove your boots, Captain.
Now, come here.
The fool.
It was foolish not to carry out my order.
And it was foolish to walk across a floor full of glass.
If I were you,
I wouldn't have done it.
I would have killed me first.
But you lack that courage, don't you, Captain?
Come closer.
Well.
Uh!
Ah.
Sergeant Small, it's your show now.
Please, try not to let me down.
Yes, sir.
Lovely.
I take guard duty very seriously.
Elvis, Elvis, come out and play.
Hey, baby, what do you say, me and you, Vegas?
Bollocks!
Boo!
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca!
Ha ha, got you.
You butt smear.
What'd I tell you?
Don't say butt smear.
It's not becoming.
Say... asshole.
Or dickwad.
- Trade you.
- What?
I'll sneak you some food for that danger ball you found.
I don't know.
You know how to work it?
- Mm-hm.
- If you don't... you're steak tartare.
All right.
First, go get me my food.
Happy birthday.
I knew you couldn't resist me.
Snip snip.
Don't come any closer.
You gotta stay there.
And watch.
Okay, you can come a little bit closer.
But you can't touch.
Hi.
Lose the scissors.
Shit.
Water and Power, hands in the air!
Over here, over here!
It's the troopers.
Confirmed, they've been siphoning water.
Well, keep going.
We're just gettin' to the good stuff.
Ooh, yeah.
Okay.
Uh!
- Drop something?
- Huh?
Ha ha.
Aww, shit.
Rebecca, help!
Rebecca!
- Sam!
- Rebecca!
No!
Richard!
Come on!
Shit!
We got her!
You've been stealing water.
- Not smart.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We could have a lot of fun with this one.
Well, well.
Don't you know you shouldn't own animals?
There's a water shortage.
There's your water.
Uh!
Hey, you.
Look at me when
I'm talkin' to ya.
That cut looks painful.
I like pain.
And what else do you like?
Hot oil.
Vacuum attachments.
Yeah?
Yep.
Hey, which of you gorgeous guys would like an oil change, hm?
Don't be stupid, she's gonna bite it off.
The moment I feel teeth, you feel lead.
Well, what are you waiting for?
I'm gonna need a microscope and tweezers.
It's like, uh...
You know, you're gonna have to stop this.
You're really gettin' me hot.
Freeze!
What?
Ah, ah.
She's all yours, sir.
Just how many of my men did you kill?
Mm-mm.
Eight, sir.
Eight, eight, the burning eight.
Between Sunday and Monday hangs a day so dark, it will devastate.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Look, you want to torture me, spank me, lick me?
Do it.
But if this poetry shit continues, just shoot me now please?
What, and waste all that talent?
I'm offering you the chance of a lifetime.
The honor of working for me.
Not interested.
Not yet.
Put her to work.
Dig or die!
You people are pathetic!
Come on, get back to work!
These water pipes should have been dug yesterday!
Hey, just stand still.
Hey, this scum's got a knife.
Enjoying yourself?
Uh!
Hey, what time is it?
I don't want to miss Bay Watch.
Hey, Jess, how's the jet, Jet?
I asked you a question!
There are stress cracks in the main engine turbine blades.
And the manifold pressure sensor's leaking like a sieve.
I'm doing a full teardown.
I'll have her back together by Wednesday.
You'll have her back together by morning.
I don't care if you have to work all night.
That is, of course, unless you want to make me change my mind.
Uh!
I'll have it fixed by morning.
Failure to recycle body fluids is a violation.
Number four...
Hoarding water rations is a violation.
Number five... syphoning body fluids from another prisoner is a violation.
Number six... Tampering with no smoking devices is a violation.
What is your problem?
I have gone out of my way to be nice to you!
If it wasn't for me, you would just be another whore around here.
Now, all I'm askin' for is just a little bit in return.
Quit pickin' on my girlfriend.
Uh.
Shit.
Uh, God, that is...
Thanks.
It worked.
What worked?
Mm, oh, my God.
End of shift.
All prisoners return to cells.
End of shift.
All prisoners return to cells.
Ahh!
Heh, heh, heh.
I'm in love.
Ba-ba-ba-bam.
Cool.
Systems check, stand by.
Check, check, check, check, check.
Please enter security signature.
My mom and your mom were hangin' out clothes.
- Security signature invalid.
- Shit.
You have ten seconds before cyanide gas is injected into the chamber.
- Go, go!
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Oh, no.
You know the security code to this thing?
Yeah, yeah.
Good, then get me outta here.
Go, do it.
Get to cranking.
They're hijacking a tank.
Sir, if you want my opinion...
No, I don't.
Places to wreck, people to do.
This tank, it isn't... isn't, isn't...
- isn't...
- What?
Come on, just one little adjective, we'll have a whole sentence here.
The tank isn't...
Glad.
Sad.
Mad.
- Um...
- Lonely.
It isn't op... op... operational.
How do I know you're not lyin'?
Because, if I was lying, your lungs would be full of cyanide gas.
Cool, so we get a new tank.
Wait, wait.
Look, um, nobody gets out of here without a clearance.
We're all prisoners here.
And if... if they catch you...
Then they'll, don't tell me, they'll take away my TV privileges.
I'll live with it.
My, my.
She'll be fun to break.
How's your lover?
Huh?
Yeah, I wouldn't get too attached.
She's not going to be around much longer.
Well, I bet you just can't wait to take this baby for a test run, huh?
That's too bad.
'Cause you just lost your flying privileges.
And, uh, the whole hangar is off limits too.
You happy?
Miss me?
What... what are you doing?
Oh, I was just thinking about leaving this place.
It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down.
What do you reckon?
We go to New York, see Cats.
You... you don't understand.
The... the better you behave, the more they leave you alone.
And the more they leave you alone, the better off you are.
Well, that's a bore.
There's nuttin' to be scared of.
You just gotta think about it like the first time you got laid.
You just gotta go,
"Daddy, are you sure this is right?"
Oh, you're sick.
How come you always do that?
How come you always cover your mouth when you smile?
You got bad teeth or somethin'?
- Mm, I don't know.
- Come on.
What do you say we bolt?
Oh!
You know, I'm really startin' to like it here.
People are nice, food's great, and I love my job.
I can see why you want to hang around.
Morning.
It's really hard for me to play with myself in this thing.
That's a shame.
Look, you want to play,
I'll play.
And I'll win.
No, not if it's Monopoly,
'cause I really kick ass at that game.
But, I get to be the shoe.
I'm going to ask you just one more time.
Do you want to work for Water and Power?
Oh, yeah, that sounds groovy.
I get to wear a cute little outfit like yours?
The pipe.
You're gonna really love this one.
Goes down 40 meters.
You'll get smaller and smaller the deeper you go.
Sounds wicked.
Can I go first?
I hope you're not claustrophobic.
Drop her.
Uh!
Bye.
No!
No!
Don't go.
Help!
Rebecca!
Full metal.
They didn't even have a chance to squeeze off a round.
Another outpost lost to those Rippers.
At this rate, we'll lose all our water.
Rippers must have come up from some underground sub gate.
Well then, I know just the young lady to help us find it.
Absolutely, sir.
Uhh.
Hmm, well, I'm so glad you see things my way now.
You know what I see?
No.
What?
This big honkin' booger hangin' outta your left nostril.
If I was you,
I'd use this finger to pick it out.
Uhh.
I win.
Yeah.
Lucky you.
And just wait till you see what you've won.
- Excuse me.
- Ow!
Relax, it's only a locator.
This is your pulse.
Now I'll always be close to your heart.
Your job is to penetrate this sub gate we found, which could be the entrance to the Ripper's base.
Most of these are booby-trapped, so if we hear a loud bang...
Sorry.
If not, congratulations, you just found the Ripper's hideout.
Either way, I win.
Like a piece of cheese at the end of a fishing hook.
That's you.
Ready.
- Move.
- Uh!
Rippers!
Arrgh!
Condor Control, Condor zero five,
I'm detecting Ripper activity.
Wha?
Oh, my God.
That's what you get for messin' with me.
Mine.
Well, what do you know?
Am I close to your heart now,
Kesslee?
What happened to the rest of you?
Butthead.
Cool.
Shit.
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
I thought the Rippers got you.
Hell, no.
Come on, let's go.
I ain't goin' back there.
Your gonna have to kill me first.
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm not gonna go back there either.
We're free.
Oh, no.
We better go before they come back for us.
You take the tank.
Are you sure?
Go, go, all right.
Rebecca!
Don't leave.
No! Rebecca, come on!
Rebecca, turn the engine off!
Kill the engine!
You're crazy!
Are you okay?
Sorry about the bonker on the head.
I think I need to go practice some more.
- No!
- Yes. Take that!
- No, no!
- Yes.
- Heeya!
You didn't have to rough me up so bad, Becky.
Hmm.
Look, no hands.
You could do that for a living.
Look out!
You're face has been gutted,
Mr. Kesslee, sir.
To be honest, your chances of seeing again are as likely as your arm growing back.
However,
I can make you comfortable.
No!
No pain killers.
Do I make myself clear, Doctor?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Now, what is the prognosis?
Not good, sir.
Not good.
Excuse me.
- Sir, this is Mr. Che'tsai.
- What? What?
He... uh, Che'tsai.
He, uh, specializes in cybergenic reconstructive surgery.
- Oh.
- Go ahead.
All the king's horses and all the king's men wish they had the technology I have.
If you want my services... the fee will be 100,000 liters.
Doctor, come here.
You see the glass half empty.
I prefer to see it half full.
- Don't you agree, Sergeant?
- I don't understand.
Uh!
We can't be in here.
We're trespassing.
What if somebody catches us?
Jet, there she blow, matey.
Do- do-do, do-do-do.
Put it down, it's not funny.
What is it?
Raise your hands to the sky gods.
The rains are coming.
But it hasn't rained since the comet.
I need metal to complete my ark.
I'll be taking your tank.
No, see, you won't be taking the tank.
The Rippers are waiting.
I must save them from the floods.
Tell me the security code.
Bam!
- Ha ha.
- Oh!
All right, listen, rain lady, where'd you get this?
I made it.
- Liar.
- She's lying.
How do you know?
Well, it's a little something
I designed.
It's a spectrum analyzer which recognizes voice pattern stress modulations.
It detects lies.
But I only speak the truth.
Liar.
All right, all right, I, uh, I caught it in my fish pond on a stick.
Liar.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
They were selling a girl's stuff after they had taken her prisoner.
I bought it.
It was sad, really.
What'd they do with the girl?
First, tell me what Water and Power want with her.
We're not Water and Power.
We're escaped prisoners.
Oh, in that case.
Oh, it was terrible.
They put her to work in town at Liquid Silver.
Come on, Jet, we gotta go get her.
To the bat tank.
Wait, wait, we can't go into town with those Water and Power vehicles.
Oh, oh, oh, you can fix them up here in my garage.
Ha ha.
Da- da-da-da-da...
Pow!
Yes.
Ba-ba-ba-pow!
Hey, Jet.
Nice work.
They took the bait, sir, and they're on their way to Liquid Silver for the girl.
Make sure I get the girl first,
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
I'm outta here.
What you got there, little boy?
No, I don't need none of that today, thank you.
Nice hats.
Rebecca, do you know what kind of place this is?
Yeah, come on, let's split up and find Sam.
Hi, how many would you like?
I got a guy here who wants the school girl thing.
For real.
Introduce him to Sam.
She's just a girl.
Not for long.
Dancers, welcome to Liquid Silver.
I could get you out.
First, we are going to create your look.
Girls, please step up to the glamour port in front of you.
Your dressing room is equipped with the latest Liquid Silver fashions.
We will start by shaving all inappropriate hair.
If your ears are not pierced, you'll find an ear puncher before you.
The crop top.
The anklets and the mules.
The spiraling arm cuff.
And now, the wrap skirt.
You have now finished creating your look.
If you have followed instructions properly, you should appear as so.
Lock up your sons.
Now, you stop this childish behavior this instant.
Do you want me to tell your mother how naughty you've been?
Do you?
Don't take my silver, it's all the money I've got.
Silver, I'll have that.
Uhh.
The clapper.
That's what you get for being a perv.
Hey, you're gonna get fired if you keep treatin' the guests like that.
Rebecca!
There she is!
- Uh-oh.
- And the little girl!
- Sam, come on.
- Get them!
- Hey!
- Guards!
Hurry!
Kill her.
Kill them both.
Not a good idea.
Now, everybody drop your guns, or I scrape off all her makeup.
This might take me a really long time.
Ha ha.
Sam, is this the lady that put you in a room with that scumbag?
Yeah.
A ten-year-old girl.
She has to learn sometime.
Look, you got two choices...
Either I improve that lovely hairdo...
Ooh! or you sing for us.
Ooh!
Fine.
All right, what do you want me to sing?
"Let's do it. "
Cole Porter, 1928.
Ooh!
I hate that song.
I'll cut it off.
Louder!
I can't hear you.
Everybody.
Come on, you too!
What the hell is that?
Sounds like Cole Porter to me, sir.
End it!
Yes, sir.
Move, come on, let's go, let's go now!
Sam!
Jet, Jet, Jet, where's Sam?
- Sam!
- Sam!
Sam!
Rebecca!
Let go!
Rebecca!
Sam!
Sam!
You let her go!
- Sam!
- Sam, Sam!
Help!
Sam!
Don't worry, your friends'll be along shortly to save you, my little princess.
The Rippers?
Are you kidding?
You don't know what they're like.
Are you out of your mind?
Listen to me, you haven't seen these things.
They're not human.
They're demons from hell.
I'm telling you.
Look, if we're gonna rescue Sam, we're gonna need an army.
They're an army.
Yeah, but...
Rebecca, we've been combing the desert all night.
We'll never find the Ripper's sub gate.
Look, rain lady said the Ripper's sub gate was around here somewhere.
Near two rocks.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca, where are you?
What's going on?
Rebecca?
Rebecca!
Rebecca!
Ah!
Jet, what took you so long?
What?
Uh!
What?
See hell, go to hell.
Duhh.
Oh, my God, it's the elephant man.
Hey, Quasimodo guy, we're hungry in here!
How 'bout some food.
- Ah!
- Now, you've done it.
[coughing
We're dead.
So, like... what are your names?
- Give me the gas.
- And like, what are you doing here?
Is it true what they say about guys with big shoes?
- Ooh.
- Yeah.
He asked you a question.
Answer it!
Hey, I have two words for you.
Brush your teeth!
They're spies.
They got Water and Power logos all over 'em.
Yeah, I was thinkin' that, right?
But then, I was also thinkin' that if they are Water and Power,
No, no, no, don't you. why would they come here advertising it?
Check it out.
Tattoos.
Give me that.
I wonder where else they got 'em.
I don't think those are tattoos.
I mean, like, who would want some alphabet soup?
I'd rather have a dragon or some... somethin' more
Aquarian related, you dig?
They're prisoner stamps.
- Mine.
- Prisoner, my ass.
That's exactly what they want us to think.
Or better yet, that isn't what they want us to think.
That way, we'll think what they think we might think.
But actually...
- Booga.
- Huh?
Try not to speak.
How much did they pay you to spy on us?
Shut up!
You should go easy on the truth serum.
It might send 'em off.
Hey.
On second thought, that could be to our advantage.
That's good, I'm tired of asking them questions anyway.
- I say we kill 'em.
- I say we hump 'em.
I say we get crumpets and tea.
Tasty.
Crumpets and tea.
All in favor of crumpets and tea, say "aye. "
Aye.
Shut up! Ain't gonna be no crumpets and tea.
We're gonna take 'em outside right now and waste 'em.
I think they're nice.
I... I say we let 'em go.
Let 'em go? They're spies!
I'm gonna kill 'em myself.
- Wait.
- Whoa!
Now, I don't remember anybody puttin' you in charge, T-Saint.
Yeah, he's right.
We're a committee now.
We'll vote on it.
Dig, all in favor of killin' 'em, raise your tail.
And all those in favor of not killin' 'em...
- Gentlemen, it's a tie.
- Coin toss time.
This is pathetic.
Hey, no cheating.
Ready, one, two...
I've got you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do you suppose me and Jet could go to the bathroom?
Uh, it's totally negatory.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You know, me and Jet can make it worth your while.
Put a little smile on that kangaroo face.
You got baseball cards?
Oh, but... no.
But, um, I... I know where
I could get you some.
She does.
It's totally negatory.
No, wait, wait, wait, uh, uh... come on.
Now, you don't want to be like those other manimals in there.
We're not manimals.
What are you?
The army wanted to build the ultimate soldier, so they messed with, uh, kangaroo NDA and...
You mean DNA.
Yeah.
And they created us.
And then the war ended and they told Johnny to poison us.
Johnny Prophet?
Yeah.
Why?
Because he was the one that made us.
But then he didn't do it because he decided that he liked us too much.
I have this great idea.
You, me, and Jet go for a visit with Johnny Prophet.
Well, when he get's back, yeah.
Uh, well, maybe.
Where did he go?
To, uh, uh, New Zealand for a little while to, uh, help some scientist guy who's makin' sea water so you could drink it.
Does she need to know that?
Did they need to know that?
- Uh, I was just...
- Get your ass outta here!
Uh!
Go ahead WP-2.
Hey, you guys, hey!
We have a shipment coming tonight from Red Sands, over.
Water and Power's gettin' some kind of shipment in.
What kind of shipment?
I don't know, all I know it's coming in from Red Sands.
- When?
- Tonight.
What if it's a arms shipment?
It's a trap.
What if they want us to think it's a trap, but it's really not?
That way, when we get there, it could still be one.
Or better yet, what if...
- Booga!
- Huh?
Why don't you make yourself useful and go and choke on something.
Oh, that's cold, man.
Okay, we're gonna give you chicks a chance to prove yourself.
Call it an initiation.
You fail, you die.
Yeah, but first you gotta strip.
That's not in the plan.
Why not?
Ha ha ha.
Hold on, cats.
All right.
All you have to do is confirm the shipment.
Copacetic?
You're gonna use this.
But you have to be really careful with it.
- Let me see.
- Because I designed it with a...
I, uh... I especially built it with a visual send processor.
It's a little invention that I invented myself, I might add.
Smile.
Oh, and these are so you can hear us.
This one's for you.
And this one I made especially for you.
- Hmm.
- Let me help you put it on because it's kind of tricky to...
Oh, I'm sorry, how clumsy of me.
- Ohh.
- What?
- Get off.
- It was hard to clip on.
Whaa...
Okay, so, we can hear you.
But how are you gonna hear us?
Just speak facin' West.
We'll hear you all right.
The code will be, "On the road. "
Yeah.
He's Jack Kerouac incarnated.
Uh, we... we're all reincarnated.
That means you're not really dead or you just think you're dead...
Who'd you used to be?
A cop.
Figures.
I used to be Ted Smith, assistant manager at Chief Auto Parts in Cincinnati, Ohio.
- Oh, fascinating.
- Oh, thank you.
I was a dog, but because
I was really good, they, uh, moved me up to human being status.
Uh, sort of.
Uh!
Strike.
North, wait...
South, West.
Mr. Kerouac,
I'm sending you an image.
Oh, he... here it comes.
This is the south side of the warehouse.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- That's gotta be it.
- Let's move!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All I see is a couple of workers unloading some crates.
For all you know, that could be toilet paper.
I don't see no Water and Power vehicles out there.
Tell you the truth,
I don't see jack shit.
We need more proof.
Yeah, I'll give you more proof.
I've got your proof.
- Whoops, there it is.
- Oh, my.
Tasty.
Damn it.
We gotta get in closer if we're gonna take pictures of those weapons.
What are you doing?
Those guys'll mangle you.
Jet, they're men.
Move it or lose it.
- Whoop!
- Ooh!
- Becca.
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.
What's this for?
Work with me, girl.
What do you mean, work with you?
What are you doing?
Uh, fabulous.
I have died and gone to hard body heaven.
Shaniqua, don't dally.
You are giving me realness.
Delfrieda, darling, be a good little girl and let's get set up.
Over there by the crates.
Take off your shirt.
What are you doing here?
This is a restricted area.
I know you're not talking to me like this.
- Obviously, you didn't get the memo.
- What memo?
Darling, we are doing a men of Water and Power calendar.
- Oh.
- And I think you would be the perfect supermodel cover.
Oh.
You mean, we get to be calendar guys?
Can I be December?
Baby, you can be any month you want.
Yeah!
LeJeanne, have we left ourselves in our purse?
- Shoot the men near the crates.
- Uh!
It's more... manly.
Quickly.
Come on, get up, get up, come on.
- All right, here we go, okay.
- Oh, my goodness.
You are so beautiful, you're making me sick.
Smile for me.
Yes!
Yes.
What's this?
I don't know.
Let me see you... open your shirt.
Quick, quick, all right, now smile, let me see those teeth.
Come on, okay, yes, yes, yes, I like that.
Those are definitely weapons in those crates.
We better move.
No way, the whole thing is so convenient, man.
If they wanna be down with us, tell 'em to hijack the shipment themself.
If they pull it off, then we'll think about it.
Fine, I'll have the goods to you in an hour.
Asshole.
Oh!
The glamour has left the building.
There's no magic, there's no sparkle, there's no je ne sais quoi.
Come, Jetina.
Hold your chest, come on, brilliant, that's great.
Jetina, come.
Oh, God, that's great!
Yes, you're so brilliant, you're a supermodel...
The super has left the model, girl.
Come on.
So, when's the calendar comin' out?
Mmm, let's go!
Turbo boosters.
Ba-dah!
What the hell?
Suck on this, dirtbag!
And keep your ass out of the fast lane!
Damn!
Jet, what are you wearin' tonight?
Jetness, remember me?
Hijacking shipment, me, you.
Jet, hello.
Shit, I've got a malfunction.
Well fix it fast and get your narrow little butt over here.
I wouldn't want you to miss all this fun.
Do you mind?
I'm tryin' to have a little lunch.
Oh, now you're workin' my tits.
You guys can't shoot worth a shit.
- Uh!
- Ha, hey oh, ha, ha, ha!
Damn, where is she?
Road kill.
I'm too young for this shit.
Hey, I guess we got rid of her, huh?
Jack!
- Uh, uh!
- Hi.
Ha, ha.
Feeling a little inadequate?
- I'm out of here.
- Go!
Hey, girl, glad you could join me.
I'm in the semi and I got the goods.
Rebecca, can you hear me?
There's a big cliff coming up on you.
Now, hit the breaks.
Hit the brakes!
Oh, brakes aren't working girl, plan B.
Get out of there quick.
Jump!
Aw, shit!
Ah!
Rebecca!
Grab on.
I came as fast as I could.
I know you probably didn't need help.
But I got here as fast as I could.
I had it all under control, Booga.
That squash is really good.
A toast to our newest members.
May their energies enhance the spirit of our circle.
Yeah. Here, here.
Ahhh, great.
Now, let's check out the weapons.
After the ceremony, the weapons'll be disposed of.
Why?
After all that?
Uh, we don't use guns.
Uh-huh.
You don't use guns?
No, Prophet taught us to fight without the corruption of guns.
- Yeah.
- Let us all hold hands.
Oh, great.
Please.
I'd like to recite a poem that I've written.
Oh, cool.
Laugh, you butterfly that dances in the mud.
Laugh, you piece of dental floss.
- You burn me toast.
- Yeah.
Laugh, you pig that flies in the sky with rainbow Twinkie fluid and three liters of high-octane petrol.
Oh, yeah.
- Whew.
- Yeah, heh, heh.
- Bravo.
- Yes, sir.
Hit it again.
Thank you.
Now, let's pray.
Uh! Uh!
Come on, Jet.
Here we go...
What are you doing?
We're praying to the spirit of freedom.
Prophet taught us religion.
Hallelujah!
Damn right.
- Come on.
- Oh, no, I can't, I'm not good at...
It's okay, I have condoms.
Yay, Jet!
Booga, where'd you learn to dance?
Oh, wow.
It's one of Johnny Prophet's dreams.
See how the people are all free and the water just comes down from the sky and it don't cost nothin'.
With flowers and rainbows.
It's beautiful.
This is just like Christmas, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.
- I love opening things.
Especially when you don't know what's inside.
I remember the first Christmas
I got to open something.
- Mm-hm.
- It was a book.
I didn't know what the title was
'cause the cover was ripped off.
But it had these really cool pictures...
- Booga!
- Okay, okay, I'm done.
Let's get this one.
Two, three.
It's dirt.
This is bullshit.
We've been had.
Good job.
Come on, help me open this one over here.
One, two, three.
Jesus Christ.
Johnny Prophet.
Motherfucker Kesslee killed Prophet!
Okay guys, here's the plan.
Water and Power has mines all the way from here to here.
No, there's no way through 'em.
How 'bout we go over 'em?
Yeah, that's great.
How you plan on sneakin' over the top?
- Fly?
- Yep.
We've got the stolen flyer.
All we have to do is paint it back the way it was and pow.
What happens when they ask for a security code?
- Then what, huh?
- Yeah, then what?
Well, uh, maybe we could, uh, wait till another flyer does a routine scout.
We capture his ID code and we're in.
Brilliant.
Okay, I will meet you there.
Wait, what do you mean meet us there?
I'm not goin' in without my tank.
- Gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're listenin' to her now?
I thought we were committee.
We gotta vote.
Okay.
Everybody for that pathetic plan, raise your paw.
Majority, let's go.
All right, let's hit it.
Committee.
Condor zero four, respond when airborne.
Okay, okay,
I got us an ID code.
- Cool.
- You are just too cool.
All right, now, try to sound relaxed.
And whatever you do, only repeat what I tell you.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Condor Control, this is Condor zero four, over.
- What did she say?
- Okay.
Condor Control, Condo, um, I mean, um, Condor four, come in, over.
Condor four, we just sent you out.
You must have a stabilizer in your left modifier.
- Okay.
- Come on, go ahead.
Must be a, um, stabilizer in the left, in the modifier.
Condor four, why aren't you using your assigned frequency?
- Must be a short haircut.
- What?
- No!
- Ow.
- Uhhh.
- Short circuit.
Yeeah!
Whoa! Aah!
Get 'em!
Just repeat what she tells you.
You're blowing it!
Say again, zero four.
You're blowing it, Donner, just listen to me okay?
- No!
- We're dead.
We're dead.
Condor zero four, you said you're dead?
All right, that's it.
Turn this boat around or you're gonna get us all killed.
Now! Do it now!
No!
We're going in!
You are gonna listen to me.
For once, you're gonna shut your deformed face and you're gonna let me do my stuff!
Have you got that?
All right.
Home plate, this is Condor four.
We have pirate interference.
Obviously, a Ripper ploy to confuse you.
Now, here's the situation...
This bird has got no electrical and in about two minutes, we're gonna be kissing gravel.
So, listen to me, you spam sucker.
Either you get off your butt and clear us for landing, or I'm going to fly this rocket right up your socket!
Uh, roger, zero four, you're cleared for hangar A.
- Cool.
- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
'Bout time.
Damn.
Yeeah!
Start the water.
Shoving a small, innocent child down the pipe and then slowly letting her drown.
Is that wrong?
Move out!
Looks all clear.
Let's go, daddy-o.
- Did you hear that?
- What? I don't hear anything.
Shh! Must be 150 of them.
Hundred and sixty-three.
We're toast.
Actually, 164.
Definitely.
Rebecca.
Are you okay?
Ohhh.
Okay, come on, come on.
Go on.
Go, go, go, go.
No!
You see that light down there?
Light is not our bag.
Yeah, we're much better in the dark like Count Chocula.
Dracula, fool.
Count Chocula is the guy on the laundry detergent box.
Duhh!
- If I asked you something...
- No, he is... he's right.
Shut up.
Thank you.
Could we just figure out what we're gonna do, please?
Well, there are power boxes down at the end of this aisle.
If only we could get to them.
Later, cats.
No!
Sir, we've got action.
Let's get this over with quickly,
Sergeant.
There he is!
Uh!
Hang on a second, we've lost power.
What the hell happened to the lights?
Guard!
Watch our back.
- Oh, no, Deet?
- Deetee, come on, man.
Deetee?
Hold on, man, hold on.
Deetee!
Oh, my God.
No.
I'll see you cats at that big jam in the sky.
Oh, no, no.
No.
Help.
Rebecca, help.
Hang on, I hear you!
Can't breathe.
Please, help me.
I can't breathe.
Please help me.
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
If you're looking for Sam, she's in the pipe!
What, again?
Piece of shit.
Now, there's something about you that's different.
I think it...
I'll tell you what's different.
I've lost my patience.
And you've lost the fight.
Oh, I played you.
I played you like an old fiddle.
Well, uh, maybe we could, uh, wait till another flyer does a routine scout.
We capture his ID code and we're in.
Brilliant.
Jet.
She's been workin' for you this whole time.
No, you were.
You're a walking, talking, living microphone.
I had them planted all over your body.
Thank you for serving up the Rippers.
Uh!
They'll make great shoe leather for my soldiers.
Uh!
Need a hand?
Come on, get up.
- What happened?
- Oh, I'm so pretty.
I'm gonna hit you so hard you're children will be born bruised.
Get up!
P- p-p-p-p-pow.
Uh!
Marvelous, isn't it?
State of the art holographic technology.
Mm.
You know what it means?
It means I can hurt you, but you can't hurt me.
I won and you know it.
Come on.
Say it, say it.
Just say I won.
- I won.
- No! No!
Say I won!
I won.
Hmm, say it.
And the little girl lives.
I'd rather her die than live as your slave.
Uh!
What took you so long?
Well, well, well.
I win.
What's the matter with you?
Finish him!
Aw, shit.
Don't tell me you're out of ammo.
Don't move a muscle.
I hate wastin' good beer for nothin'.
Thirsty?
Get her!
Screw this, man.
Uh!
Die!
Die!
Higher, higher!
Come on!
One for the road.
Die!
I'm melting, I'm melting.
Is that the best you can do?
Try this close to your heart, asshole!
Did I hurt you yet?
It's not over... over.
It's not over... It's not... It's not...
It's not... It's not...
Help.
Hang on, I hear you!
Help, help.
- Hold on.
- Rebecca.
Fuck me.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't want to.
It's over.
Don't move!
Down!
See ya in the next world.
Atten-hut!
General, uh, we have taken out the airfields and now have control of the bridge.
Awaiting your next command, sir.
I, uh, I took the bullets out of their guns.
Real smart, huh?
Booga, that was very smart.
Mm-mm-mm-mm.
Giggles.
Yes.
What do you say we blow this joint?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeeah!
Rebecca, hit the brakes!
Waterfall ahead!
Shut up, you'll ruin the surprise.
Yeeah!
Ker-pow!
Ah!
Bravo!
Yay!
That was great!
Do the bird trick!
Bird trick.
Let's hear it
For the amazing, colossal, stupendous antoine and babette!
Yeah, mr. Antoine!
Aww.
How sweet!
Wait, now.
Wow!
Where did it go?
I'll be back between shows,
And i want you ready for bed.
No tv till you finish that report.
Tell mr. Antoine the mouse won't eat.
You hear me? No tv.
Now give your mom a big kiss.
And don't let that mouse out of the cage.
I won't.
Mrs. Partridge, i'll be back between shows.
All right.
Drive careful.
Ok. Love you!
Tell mr. Antoine he won't eat!
Ok. See ya!
Wouldn't want to be ya!
Make sure you tell him!
Ok! I will!
Don't forget to!
Ok!
Mr. Antoine is teaching me
How to make lightning disappear.
Mm-Hmm.
Sooner the better.
I'm not a mouse person.
Come on. Let's get in here and do some more tricks.
Attaboy.
I'm going to call albert.
I'll see you for the next show.
Say hi to albert for me.
Aw, thanks.
Hello.
It's lorraine, mrs. Partridge.
How's my boy?
Oh, he's fine. Fine.
Ate all his vegetables tonight, even his broccoli.
Good. Good.
Well, i need to go to the market, and i'll be home within the hour.
Is it my mom?
Hold on.
Here comes mr. Magician.
Mom, i did my hoover dam report.
I'm going to read it to you.
I'm coming home to put you to bed.
You can read it to me then.
I'll just read you the first part.
"45 miles from las vegas is the hoover dam.
It is one of the highest dams of the entire world."
Ooh!
That's my opener.
Oh, it's stupendous!
I'm hooked!
And the rest of it when i get home.
And i want you to brush your teeth.
Hi, albert, honey!
It's ruthie.
Hi, ruthie!
Mom.
Yeah?
I'm working on mr.
Antoine's card move...
The rise-And-Fall move he showed me.
I think i got it.
It's all in the wrist.
It's all in the wrist, and so is brushing your teeth.
Now, i'll be home soon, and look, albert,
I want you to be gentle with mrs. Partridge, ok?
She's brittle.
Ok.
Miss rylander gave me an "a" on my report on ethiopia.
Great. Wonderful.
"Ethiopia is in the northern part of africa.
"Children in ethiopia are very hungry.
There was a drought there."
That means no rain.
Good work, albert!
I love you.
I'll be home soon, but i want you to brush your teeth and get into bed.
Ok. Ok.
Ok, promise me?
Promise.
Promise?
Promise.
Ok. I love you.
Love you too, mom. Bye.
Mrs. Partridge, i have something to show you.
What...Your room?
Yes!
It's a mess.
Ok, mrs. Partridge,
I have an empty brown bag.
Uh-Huh.
I will open the brown paper bag like this.
Now give me the ketchup bottle.
Careful you don't break it.
I won't.
Put the ketchup bottle in the bag.
Watch!
Uh-Huh.
Say the magic words...Sim-Sola-Bim.
Poof! It's gone!
Oh, come on, now, albert.
Nobody's going to believe that.
Don't like it?
Hee hee hee!
âª sing me a lullaby âª
âª won't you wipe away my pain? âª
âª take me out âª
âª ohh âª
âª of the driving rain âª
Hello. Is this the franklin residence?
Yes.
Ma'am, can we please come inside and talk to you?
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Ma'am, i regret to inform you
That mrs. Franklin has been involved in a very serious vehicle accident.
Mom!
"I am the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in me, though he were dead,
"Yet shall he live.
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
But have eternal life and peace forever."
Amen.
Ok. Now.
It is a sad day here.
We are confused.
We do not understand.
Je ne comprends pas.
Tell me, god,
Is life the illusion, and is death the reality?
What door do you go through, lorraine,
And where will you appear again?
Allez. Au revoir, ma petite.
Bon voyage.
Oh.
"45 miles from las vegas is the hoover dam.
It is one of the highest dams in the entire..."
I'm sorry, albert.
Keep reading, baby.
Keep going.
Shouldn't i do this?
It's all right, mon grand.
Keep reading.
Don't stop, albert.
It's so beautiful.
Yes.
But I'm making everybody sadder.
It's all right, mon cheri. Go on.
Go.
No. Everybody's too sad.
Mother wasn't sad.
My mother was never sad!
Why can't we keep him?
We could all...
Babette, this is not a pet, you know.
But he's so little, and we love him.
Hey, ruthie, you must know more about the family.
What about the father?
Yes, ruthie.
The father.
Father?
The father was just a fly-By-Night.
She thought he was magic.
Maybe he was, 'cause he sure did disappear.
I don't even think she got his last name.
Grandparents?
She didn't have any family...
No parents, no grandparents,
No brothers, no sisters.
She was raised in a foster home
Back in newark, new jersey.
If there's no family, where will albert go?
Why can't i just stay here?
Albert!
Honey, we thought you were fast asleep.
Come on, honey.
Let's go back to bed.
Mr. Antoine said he was my father.
C'est une facon de parler.
It is an expression.
He loves you like a father.
Oui. Je t'aime beaucoup, albert.
You know you are my favorite.
We all love you, albert.
We would like to take you with us,
But we move around so much.
We have no maison...
No home...
And a circus is not a home.
You were going to teach me to be a magician.
You said i could be in the act one day.
I've been practicing.
I'm really good with the a.B.C. Trick,
And i already know the over-The-Falls and the 50-Cent discovery.
Mrs. Partridge, you saw me do it.
I fooled you, didn't i?
Yes. You certainly fooled me.
And my fingers are getting stronger all the time,
And my wrist.
Look!
See? See?
It's all in the wrist.
To whom it may concern: in the event of my death,
Please contact my foster sister harriet franklin.
Even though our lives have gone separate ways
And it's been many years since we've spoken,
I've always thought of her as the godmother of my son albert,
Who i am leaving in her care.
I believe she will always be there for albert...
"As harriet and i were once there for one another.
"She is most likely still in newark.
I know she'll want to do the right thing."
Signed, lorraine franklin.
The boy has a guardian.
It's his godmother...
Harriet franklin.
Any of you ever heard of her?
Janet, get me directory assistance for newark, new jersey.
Let me ask harriet, ok?
Hold on. Hold on.
Harriet!
Can you hold on one second?
What is it?
Mike belasco's claiming we over-Delivered on the coasters.
Penny, did you remember to verify the order?
Verbally and in writing, like you said.
Bob, can you hold on one second?
It's so busy here.
Mike, what's the problem?
No, no, no. We didn't over-Deliver.
You over-Ordered.
What were you thinking, ordering pink coasters?
You got a cigar manufacturers convention going on!
No. Hold on a second.
Bob, you still there?
I'll be right with you.
I tell you what.
I'm going to do you a big favor.
You send me back the pink ones, i'll send you the brown ones,
You pay for shipping.
Ok? I'm going to put penny on. Penny!
What?
Get on with belasco.
We're finally getting rid of those goddamn brown coasters.
Bob! Sorry about that.
You know, when you're busy, the world is on hold.
Now, as i was saying, i want to get into bigger things, bob.
I want to get into sterilizers and deep fryers...
To cook things in.
I really feel...
Reliable hotel and restaurant supply.
We're there for you.
Yes?
No. I found a wonderful warehouse.
It's full of inventory.
All you have to do is come and see it with me.
Make the day. Any day.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You just let me know, ok?
Thanks. Bye-Bye.
One moment, please.
Somebody from las vegas on line 2?
Something about lorraine, your sister?
I didn't know you had a sister.
Hello.
Hello. Miss franklin?
Yeah.
Miss franklin, my name is clay thrasher.
I'm a lawyer at the hotel where lorraine franklin has been working.
Uh-Oh. What's wrong?
What, is she in some kind of trouble?
I'm afraid it's worse than trouble, miss franklin.
Lorraine was killed last week in an automobile accident.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Lorraine was killed last week in an automobile accident.
You are lorraine's foster sister,
Is that correct, miss franklin?
You're telling me lorraine is dead?
Miss franklin, this is ruth clark.
I was lorraine's best friend.
We would have told you sooner,
Except...
We just found out about you.
We're sorry to break the news to you this way, miss franklin.
Oh, no. I...
I understand, and thank you for calling.
No, no. Please don't hang up.
Miss franklin, there's something more we need to talk about.
What?
It's about albert...
Lorraine's little boy.
Lorraine had a little boy?
Now, what i have before me, miss franklin,
Are some documents naming you the boy's guardian.
What?!
Oh. Oh!
No. No. No.
No. No. I...
Uh-Uh. No.
You know, first you tell me lorraine is dead,
And now you tell me she's got a kid,
And then you're going to spring on me
That I'm supposed to be responsible for it?
He's not an ordinary boy, miss franklin.
He's really a wonderful boy, harriet.
He's a magical boy.
Was that him?
Who was that?
I'm antoine.
Who?
Albert's good friend.
The problem is that right now, he is a homeless boy.
Well, what about his father?
We can't find the father.
There is no father.
What do you mean, there is no father?
The boy wasn't immaculately conceived, was he?
Listen, you people, let me explain something to you.
I don't have a motherly bone in my body, ok?
I'm not a mother.
I don't want to be a mother.
Now, i also assume that this little boy is white, is he not?
Have you got a problem with that?
Yeah...Just a small one.
'Cause I'm black, too, you know,
And i think that your sister would be damned upset with you
If she thought that you wouldn't take albert
Because you think that black gets in the way!
That's not what i said.
It didn't bother his mother,
And you grew up with white folks, didn't you?
What has my growing up with white folks
Have to do with me raising some little white boy?
It's who you are.
You are the closest thing that he's got to blood!
You understand the alternative
Would be to place him in the state system, miss franklin?
No...
God!
What happens now?
Bye.
Bye, albert.
Bon voyage.
Albert!
Don't you even want to say good-Bye to your friends?
No.
Bye-Bye, albert!
Albert, bye-Bye.

The flight from las vegas...Is it in?
Landed 20 minutes ago.
I'm looking for a little boy.
Wait, wait. Are you miss harriet franklin?
Yes.
The boy's waiting down at traveller's aid, down level one.
Take the escalator, turn right.
Ok. Escalator, turn right.
You wouldn't be miss franklin?
Actually, i would be.
Oh.
I'm sorry I'm late.
The jackson street bridge was out, and i couldn't get across.
Yes, I'm sure that's true.
Well, we have to give ourselves a little more time these days,
Especially when picking up such precious cargo.
I'll need to see some identification, please.
I'm sorry.
Passport, driver's lic...
Thank you.
Boy, do you look like your mother.
I.D. Is fine.
You have to sign right there.
Great.
Are you a card player?
Oh, no.
He's a magician.
He can make the ace of spades
Turn into the queen of hearts.
Looks like he's on sale.
Can i take the tag off?
Usually the tag's taken off at the gate when they're picked up.
I said i was sorry.
Mm-Hmm.
Ok. Let me get your tag off here.
Sorry.
There you go.
Thank you.
So get your backpack and...
We'll go.
What's in the parcel?
My pillow.
Oh.
Ok. Let's go.
Good luck, Albert.
That's it. No more shortcuts for me.
I know better.
You know, there's no shortcuts in life.
I'm sure you know that.
I know that.
It's the kind of thing where you just have to concentrate.
Because i don't know how i got here.
I'm not sure i am here.
You know what?
I don't think I'm here.
As a matter of fact, i think I'm not really here.
As a matter of fact,
I am an alien space monster,
And I'm going to eat you up!
Aah!
What's the matter?
My coloring book.
What about it?
I left it on the airplane.
We'll get you another one.
I need that one!
Hey, I'm going to get towed away!
Flight 106 from st. Louis now arriving at gate 61.
Never mind.
It's ok.
We can go now.
Oh, well,
I'm relieved,
Because we weren't going back to get a coloring book.
It's all right.
She's nervous.
She's a space monster.
She has funny hair, huh?
I know.
You know what?
I don't know.
Oh.
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't write that ticket, man.
I had to pick up the little boy.
He was traveling by himself in traveller's aid.
Don't you have kids?
No.
Well, listen.
It wasn't that long.
I wasn't here but 3 minutes.
I was not here
15 minutes.
I would know if i was here 15 minutes.
Get in the car.
If i was here
15 minutes,
I would not be fooling around with you.
What are you doing?
Get in!
I wasn't here 15 minutes.
I was here 3 minutes.
Why are you writing a ticket?
I'm not paying it,
I'm just telling you now.
Don't pay it, lady.
Pay your lawyer.
Do you believe that guy had the nerve to give me a ticket?
I mean, there's drug addicts out there,
There's crazy people starting fires, running around naked,
And what is this guy doing...
The police department, our fabulous police department?
Giving me a ticket.
I work every day.
I pay rent.
I could have been picking up
A loved one or something.
Oh, loved one.
That sounds good.
Well, can't cry about it.
Cannot cry about it.
So...you play cards, huh?
He does magic.
I do magic.
You do magic, huh? Good.
Yes, yes. You do the french pass.
I know.
You know what?
Nothing.
Why do you keep saying "i know"?
Tell her you are thinking.
I was thinking.
Oh, good.
That's something we can do together...Think.
Think.
This is it.
277 barrow.
That's where we live.
Can you remember that?
Yeah.
Now, listen, uh...
277 barrow?
Yeah.
I've always lived alone,
So we're going to have to have some rules, ok?
You ok with rules?
Sometimes.
Do you have to go to the bathroom?
Because if you do, it's down the hall.
Now, i've only got one,
So we're going to have to figure out what we want to do.
I don't want you to leave toothpaste in the sink because it's really nasty.
I'll try not to do the same thing.
The other thing is i would really appreciate it
If you would put down the toilet seat because...
Well, it's just because it's courteous.
Oh. I gave the mets a pretty good deal on some coffee mugs,
So they gave me a baseball.
I have a baseball signed by liza minelli.
Why would liza minelli sign a baseball?
The sahara hotel was playing
The hilton hotel on sunday.
My mom took me, and mr. Antoine
Got liza minelli to sign a ball.
It says, "to my favorite all-Star, from liza minelli."
Engelbert humperdinck hit a home run in that game.
Well, you know, i don't really get engelbert humperdinck.
He's nice.
Picked me up once.
He's strong.
âª please release me âª
âª let me go âª
Are you hungry?
No.
Well, you have to eat something.
Come in here.
I got us a couple of tv dinners.
What kind?
Fish cakes.
Fish cakes?
Oh, no.
You like fish, don't you?
It's like brain food.
We like nachos.
Well, we don't have no nachos.
We have fish cakes.
We have fish cakes with cauliflower and brownies.
That's what we have.
Here are the plates, and here are the cups.
Styrofoam?!
They're not biodegradable.
That's too bad, because i got 2,500 of them.
They're all misprinted, so i got stuck with them.
I think it's too early to talk about biodegradable.
No, no.
She's a polluter.
What?
Nothing.
Why don't i show you your room?
I want to go home.
She's nervous.
She scares me.
I'll stay by your side like krazy glue.
Promise?
I never break a promise.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
Mumbling all the time.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You notice i got you your own television set,
And if you look out the window,
You'll see there's a park.
In the park, there's a playground.
If anybody says anything to you, run.
Now, we're looking into boys' clubs and ys for you
Because I'm going to be working all the time.
I don't have time to spend with you, you know,
Because I'm trying to expand my business.
I'm actually trying to buy a warehouse supply.
Yeah, well...
We're looking into summer camps for you, too.
You like summer camp?
My mom took me places in the summer.
Oh. Well, i can't do that
Because, obviously, i have a business to run.
Cupboard's over there.
Bathroom's down the hall.
I put some little mickey mouse soaps in there for you.
Want to take a bath?
I'll go run you a bath.
I'll run you a bath.
Oh, and don't mess with the fire escape.
It's off-Limits.
You know, i heard you're good in school.
Do you like school?
I guess so.
So...you miss everybody, huh?
Your mom and...
Say yes.
Yes.
Well, you're just going to have to... deal with it.
You know, you got to get strong.
Got to learn to grow up.
You don't always get choices in life.
Your mom had to do it.
I had to do it.
We had to grow up.
We grew up.
Your mom was my best friend.
She was my real pal.
You can put your things away, can't you?
He wants you to tell him a big hello.
He wants you to tell him you like his face.
Why don't you pick him up
And give a big, big kiss on his face?
I don't want her to pick me up.
Oh, yes, you do. Ooh!
No, i don't.
Oh, you cry?
Cry.
Is good to cry.
I won't cry!
I won't watch tv,
And i won't go to summer camp,
And i won't wash my hands with mickey mouse.
Maybe minnie?
No.
Goofy?
No. I want to go home!
But you have no ticket.
I have my own money.
It's all here.
I can use it for whatever i want to.
I have my own insurance policy that my mother left me.
I'm going to be really rich.
It's for college, you know?
She doesn't know anything about baseball.
All she does is talk about newark.
I hate newark.
I hate it!
She...She...She wants... she needs a friend, huh?
You should try.
I don't want to try.
Yes, you do.
No, i don't!
Yes, you do.
No, i don't!
Ye...
I want to go back to vegas.
I don't like it here.
I don't want to try.
Albert?
Your bath's ready.
Albert, let's go.
It's down here.
I ran a tub for you.
I don't know how you like it, so maybe it's too hot.
You'll get in and let me know.
I put some of this in.
It's big bird.
So...it's all ready.
Do you need me to take your cl...
I can wash myself.
Oh! Great. I'm going to fix dinner.
I can't live here.
If i live here, i'll die.
You cannot die.
You just got here.
Besides, if you die,
What will you do tomorrow?
What will i do?
I could lose my job.
If you die, I'm back waiting for someone to make me up again.
Back where?
Back where i come from.
Where's that?
That is where i am before you make me up.
Hmm?
Before i drew your picture?
Are there other people there?
Ooh!
Ooh. Everybody you can imagine.
My mother?
You should wash behind the ears.
I want to go home.
I don't like it here.
I want to see my mother.
Albert...
Your mother is dead.
I hate that word!
I want to go to where you live.
This is where i live, you know?
Here it is.
Where...Where you live, i live.
This is not where i live.
Is!
Isn't!
Is!
Isn't!
Albert, are you all right in there?
Huh?
Say yes.
Yeah.
Great. Well, hurry up.
Dinner's almost ready.
She's hungry.
Ha ha ha!
Albert, dinner's ready.
I'm not hungry.
Well, come on.
It turned out great.
I don't want any.
Come on. You got to eat something.
I don't want any!
Fine. Fine.
Albert?
Albert, i made you a sandwich.
This must be harriet.
This is mrs. Franklin, harriet...Your foster mother.
Hi.
This is your new home.
Come in.
This is harriet, everybody.
This is mr. Franklin,
Richard, david.
Hello, harriet.
And this is lorraine.
Hi.
You're going to sleep in my room,
And we can be best friends.
Albert, are you hungry?
What's in the sandwich?
Oh!
Peanuts.
Peanuts butter.
No, thank you.
Slow down!
Slow down! No running in the hallways.
You know the rules.
Ok, ms. Franklin.
I'll take albert to his class.
You can pick him up at 2:45.
Say good-Bye, albert.
Bye.
Listen to your teachers...
And don't get into trouble.
I'll be on the steps at 2:45. Be there.
You hear what she said?
Yes.
All right.
I'm going to have to call you back.
Good morning, harriet.
What, don't i exist?
Good morning, harriet. So?
How is he?
What's he like?
I don't know.
He's like a little boy.
Does he like his room?
Did you feed him?
He wasn't hungry.
He doesn't like styrofoam cups
Because they're not biodegradable.
Of course not.
He's a kid.
He's got convictions.
So? What did you guys talk about?
What did he have to say?
He didn't say much of anything to me.
He talked to his friend.
The child is obviously not alone.
He's got a friend?
Mm-Hmm.
And i can't tell you anything about him
Because he's invisible and i can't see him.
I had a little friend when i was growing up.
Little bitty thing.
Can't remember her name,
But she lived in my ear, and she wore a tuxedo,
And she whispered things to me i never knew about.
She made me feel safe.
I couldn't have survived without her.
Drudella.
Yeah.
That was her name.
Excuse me!
Do i have any appointments today?
You can see the hudson brothers at 10:00.
If you want to drop in on springer,
He's interested in the cocktail glasses at the march 30th rate.
Did bob morrison call?
He just called.
He can meet you at the warehouse at 3:00.
I have to pick up albert at 2:45.
You can make it.
I can't. You're going to have to pick him up.
I got the dentist at 3:00.
Take him with you.
I'll pick up albert if you have the root canal.
No! See...i knew this wasn't going to work out.
This is not going to work.
I haven't had a conversation with a child
Since i was a child,
And now i got one sitting on the steps
Waiting for me to pick him up at 2:45.
Goddamn!
Maybe she's not coming.
Listen to him.
She'll come.
There's no one there.
Maybe she'll never come.
This kid's really nuts.
Let's go.
She'll be mad.
I don't care.
Hey, weirdo, where are you going?
Hey, albert, who you talking to?
Come on.
âª me and my shadow âª
âª strolling down the avenue âª
âª me and my shadow âª
âª i need a friend to tell my troubles to âª
That's a big truck.
Look, look, look!
Hey, fish face!
Hey, look out!
Watch out, kid.
Why wasn't somebody watching him?
We can't watch them every minute.
We're doing the best that we can.
The parents got to assume some responsibility, too.
You were late.
You know that.
What are you telling me,
I'm irresponsible because i don't control the traffic in newark?
You should have left earlier!
Hey, you 2 kids.
Did you see albert?
You know, the new student.
Did you see him?
He went back to las vegas.
Talking to himself.
You cover the streets and the park.
I'll check out the yard here.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
You 2 kids go on home.
Hey, lady!
Your kid's weird.
Come here.
You want to see something really weird?
Sure.
Go home and look at your mothers!
Aah!
Yoo hoo!
Eat lead, mutant scum!
Aah!
I'm...dying!
Huh!
Aah!
Aah! Ha ha ha!
Whoo whoo whoo whoo!
Aah!
I got you!
Aah!
Aah!
Albert.
Albert!
What are you doing?
Do you know that everybody's looking for you?
Come on!
What is the matter with you?
Do you know that the whole school is looking for you?
And where are you?
Laying here in the park talking to yourself.
You don't even know what direction you're going.
You live that way.
Hey! Excuse me.
I was here looking for my lost son.
Get in the car.
He was lost. He's just a little white boy,
Doesn't know where he's going.
He's trying to find his way home.
Aren't we all?
No. We all are not.
I know where i live.
I live that way.
I've always known where i lived.
Please, spare me any kind of philosophy
You getting ready to throw.
Hakuna matata.
Disney cartoons everywhere you turn.
Disney, disney, disney.
People having conversations with themselves.
Like you.
You know how strange you look
Having a conversation by yourself?
I have a theory about that.
If i can't see it, it doesn't exist.
That's because you don't believe in magic.
Yeah, well...
I don't.
You know why?
Because when i was a little kid,
They used to have this show on tv called peter pan.
Had this grown woman in it named mary martin
Dressed up like a little boy,
Which i don't even want to get into now.
So this little fairy gets sick, right?
Tinkerbell.
She drinks the poison
That captain hook left for peter.
Yeah. Whoever, whatever.
Anyway, they said, "well, if you believe in magic,
"Why, then, you just clap your hands, and she'll get better.
Yeah, if you believe, clap your hands, ooh!
She'll get better."
Let me tell you something:
I didn't believe, so i didn't clap my hands, and you know what?
She got better anyway,
Which just goes to show you there is no such thing as magic.
People just try to make you believe that there is.
I watched that video with my mom.
We always clapped our hands.
Yeah, well...
Ha ha!
You can't believe...
I got caught in a detour.
You know, they're tearing up allen street.
Come on, harriet.
Nobody takes allen street.
You take rose, and you cut across the 92.
So you brought your bodyguard, huh?
Albert, mr. Morrison.
Hi. Bob.
Come on.
I just want to show you this.
Isn't this great?
Isn't this spectacular?
Isn't it everything i said it was going to be?
I mean, it's amazing.
Look at this place!
And you know what's wonderful about it?
It has its own
2 trucks.
Albert, don't break anything.
I don't own it yet.
And leave that cat alone.
Bob, so, can you see what i can do here?
You can make a lot of soup.
Bob, I'm serious.
I take you seriously, harriet.
I always did.
You know that.
Well, then, make the numbers work.
Put it together, bob, and make it work.
Wow!
Vanilla.
What do you want?
Oh, uh... strawberry!
Strawberry? What?
Ok, strawberry.
Strawberry.
And chocolate.
Chocolate.
Bananas.
âª tutti-Frutti once and spumoni twice âª
âª banana split for my baby âª
âª and a glass of plain water for me âª
âª spray the whip cream for at least an hour âª
âª pile it as high as the eiffel tower âª
Nuts!
âª load it with nuts, about 16 tons âª
âª top it with a pizza just for fun âª
âª banana split for my baby âª
âª and a glass of plain water for me âª
âª banana split for my baby âª
âª and a glass of plain water for me âª
Why wrap yourself up in this place?
It's like a big tomb.
All your vitality, why do you want to bury it in here?
Well, because this is good, bob.
This is a good investment.
I'll do my best.
That looks good.
What do you got there?
A banana split!
Uh-Huh.
May i have a taste?
Mmm!
That's good!
You know, i have a boy your age.
I'm giving him a birthday party in a couple of weeks.
Like to come?
Sure.
Good!
You like a party, don't you, harriet?
Oh, yeah!
Got to go.
Wait a minute, bob.
There's so much i want to show you.
I've seen enough.
I'll run some numbers and get back to you.
So long, albert.
Don't get no tummy ache.
So long, bob.
Run the numbers, bob.
I'll do the best i can, harriet.
Ask her if she wants a banana split.
She won't.
She won't what?
Nothing.
Come on.
Listen, uh... this is the deal.
I brought him here to show him all of this
Because i want him to give me the money to get it.
Now because of you, we're going to a party,
So i want you to take bob aside,
And i want you to say, "bob,
This investment is great for your bank."
Repeat that to me right now.
This investment is great for your bank.
Albert, can i ask you a question?
Who do you talk to all the time?
Bogus.
And, uh...where's your friend come from?
France. He's french.
French.
Oui.
Listen, albert, i got to tell you.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
If you had some visible friends.
See, then i wouldn't care
If they were from france or germany or ethiopia.
Tell her about ethiopia.
Ethiopia is in the northern part of africa.
Children in ethiopia are very hungry.
There's a drought there.
That means no rain.
Liza minnelli went there once
With shirley maclaine.
Mom told me audrey hepburn made them come.
How do you know all that?
I wrote a report.
My mom helped me.
You want a root beer?
You know, albert, you're so smart.
I...i just don't think you need
That french guy anymore.
Let me take care of him.
Say there, mr. Bogus, i don't think albert...
That's not where he is.
He's not teeny-Tiny?
He's bigger than you are.
Oh.
Oh! Ha ha!
Of course he is!
Look at him standing right over there.
Listen, it's time for you to go back to france.
You know, albert doesn't really need you anymore.
I know! No, i know that you're not happy here in newark.
You hate newark.
I know you do.
Oh. Well, no, you agree.
Of course.
Ha ha! Thank you.
Well, it's been real.
Bye-Bye now.
Au revoir.
Voila. He's gone.
You didn't really see him.
Of course i did.
What was he wearing?
A coat.
A big coat.
A big, french coat.
What color was it?
Brown. He was wearing a big, french, brown coat,
And he said to say good-Bye,
So why don't you finish your spaghetti, have an oreo cookie,
And I'm going to finish my phone calls, ok?
See, we're working it out, albert.
Bogus.
Bogus.
Bogus?
Bogus?
Bogus!
Bogus, you can come out now.
Rrrr...
Oh!
Where were you?
Why did you disappear?
She fooled you.
She fooled me, too, for a minute.
I thought i was gone.
Pendent une minute, j'ai cru que j'etais parti.
I don't want you to leave me again.
That's an order.
Oui, mon general.
You're my friend, and i want you to always be my friend.
For as long as you need me.
I'll always need you.
You're my best friend.
My only friend.
You're my mon ami.
I am your best friend.
I know you better than anyone.
Better than anyone.
Better than you know yourself.
Hello.
Hello.
Harriet?
Hello?
Hello.
Would you like to see me?
Mmm...
Huh!
Albert?
Albert, were you in my room last night?
No.
Let's go.
Uhh!
Uhh...
Words starting with "a." Anybody else?
Artichoke.
Artichoke. What a wonderful word, angela.
That will be fun to use in a sentence.
I'll show you how to spell it.
I know how to spell it.
How about alaska?
Good, thomas.
Alaska's a good subject.
It's our country's largest state.
I know that.
Uh, words beginning with "b."
Albert?
Bogus.
Bogus. Well, what a grown-Up word.
Can you tell me what it means?
It means...
Friend.
I'm afraid that's not right, albert.
Bogus is a word you'll use
When you're a little older.
It means fake.
Something that is not real.
No, bogus is real.
Bogus is not real.
The word bogus means just the opposite of real.
It means pretending to be real.
Something not being what it seems to be.
It's very important you not confuse the meaning of words.
Ha ha!
What are you looking at, albert?
What's so funny?
Mmm...nothing.
Well, now, then, albert,
Can you tell me the correct meaning of the word bogus?
It means...
Friend.
No, no, no!
Bogus means fake!
Bogus is not fake!
Don't you shout at me, young man!
No, bogus is real!
He's always been real!
All right.
All right, um...
We'll talk about this later on.
You can sit down.
Um...we'll go on.
Words starting with the letter "c."
Oh, right here.
Jeffrey.
Bob morrison's kid's birthday party.
Uh-Uh. Tell him
I'm in philadelphia.
Oh, come on, harriet.
It will be fun.
It will be good for albert.
He'll meet other kids.
What scares you about a birthday party?
Take it out of my paycheck.
Who said anything about being scared?
I'm not scared of anything.
Then what's your problem?
He's 7.
7. His mother died.
He loved her.
He's got to work it out.
I know he's 7.
I know his mother died.
I also have to work it out.
But you're not 7.
Some part of me is 7!
Let the part that's 7 be friends with his 7.
What are you, sigmund freud?
Stop analyzing me.
You are my secretary!
Take the kid to the party.
Are you ready for a surprise?
Yeah!
It's me, dr. Surprise!
Yay!
Do you like surprises?
Yes!
Harriet, harriet, harriet.
Ha ha ha!
Here's a party hat for you.
I don't...
Uh, yes, harriet.
Yes, yes, yes.
Hey, doug.
Hi, bob.
How are you?
Long time no see.
Here's a hat for you.
Kid's having a great time, harriet.
Oh, yeah.
Have some cake.
I don't...
Come on, harriet.
Have a piece of cake.
This is a nice house.
Well, i got the house.
My wife got the money.
Yes. I always thought it was the other way around.
Listen, um... about the loan...
It's a party, harriet.
We'll talk about it later.
Yay!
Is everybody having fun at dougie's birthday party?
Yeah!
And now, i want you to feast your eyes
On the magic closet:
Dr. Surprise's cabinet of mystery!
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho!
The one and only place that's guaranteed to show you
Things as they really are.
It's the double-Door trick.
Magic wand, oh, magic wand.
Choose, magic wand...
That lovely lady across the lawn!
Please, come up and help us.
Yeah, you. Yes.
No. No, thank you.
Get somebody else.
You're the one.
No, I'm not.
Just do your magic trick.
Are we going to let this lady
Get away from the magic closet?
No!
Then let's find out who she really is.
Go and get her!
Ha ha ha!
No! Come on, now!
Stop!
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho ho!
Ow!
I'm sorry. Tell her i didn't mean to hurt her.
Ok, kids, come on.
Back to your seats.
Come on, right now.
Hurry up, everyone.
Choose me, dr. Surprise.
I'll do it.
What's the matter with you, harriet?
I told him i didn't want to play.
I said no!
Just settle down, kids. Settle down. Yes.
Are you ready for another surprise?
Yes!
What am i supposed to do?
Right into the box, my little cinnamon bun.
Here is the big surprise!
Are you ready in the closet?
Yes, i am, dr. Surprise.
Ha ha ha!
Sim sola bim!
Huh! Momma!
Where's my momma?
Dr. Surprise isn't really a very good magician.
No, he's not.
That's pretty good.
I hold it this way,
And you can't see it.
And i do this.
See?
And it drops down here. See?
It's called the french pass.
More french, huh?
I've got a better one.
Mr. Antoine taught me.
He's the best magician in las vegas.
Look, i don't have time for this right now.
I have these bills i have to pay.
I just really don't have time.
I hate her!
I hate her!
He wants to show you a trick. That's all.
Why you push him away?
And now you feel so bad.
Harriet, why do you want to feel so bad?
What is this?
Belasco's 12,456 pink coasters.
I will be so glad when I'm out of the coaster business.
Let me get you a cup of coffee.
What's wrong?
Bob morrison called this morning.
Yeah?
He said the bank won't give you the loan.
He says he really wishes he could,
But he doesn't think
He can get it through the loan committee.
He doesn't think he can get it through?
Get him on the phone.
He's out of town all day.
You can't reach him.
He gave me his home number
In case you want to talk to him later.
I don't want to talk to him later.
I want to see him face-To-Face tonight.
Get on the phone, and tell him i want to see him tonight.
What about albert?
I'll get the lady downstairs.
She'll babysit.
She doesn't charge for invisible friends.
What's your order?
2 martinis.
Harvey, it seems that veta is having
A party this afternoon...
Ohh...
It's a bad idea, albert.
It's a bad idea.
You can't stop me.
But it's too far.
It's only
2 hours by bus.
I saw it in an ad.
Oh, i don't like this.
It's a bad idea.
Don't follow me.
Do you want to go to atlantic city?
Well, thank you, harvey.
I prefer you, too.
Ha ha ha!
Hi.
Huh? Oh, hi.
What a lovely movie.
Everything ok?
Fine. He's such a good little boy.
Is he asleep?
Not a sound.
At least not now.
He was in there talking to somebody,
If you know what i mean.
Yeah. What do i owe you?
Uh, $4.00 an hour, that will be $18.00.
Ok.
Oh, thank you.
You know, when my daughter was small,
She used to talk to herself all the time.
Really?
Yeah. I even had to set an extra place
For somebody named trinket.
Hell, they were real close.
Good night.
Albert?
Albert?
Come on, what are you doing?
Come on, albert, where are you?
Albert!
Albert?
Damn!
Albert! A bad idea.
It's still a bad idea!
Ah, voila.
Merci!
Hi, gomez.
It's me, albert.
Hi!
It's me...Albert.
Albert! But what are you doing here?
Mon petit chou.
Mon petit chou.
What are you doing here?
It will not work.
They will send you back.
No, they won't.
They love me.
Of course we love you.
But how did you get here?
On the bus.
On the bus?
Who'd you come with?
Where's your godmother?
Where is harriet?
Where?
I ran away.
I'm never going back.
I want to stay with you.
I can't believe you have done this, albert.
You are crazy!
I can do the egg trick.
I can do the double disappear.
C'est ridicule.
II doit retourner chez sa tante,
Et le plus tot sera le mieux.
Ne sois pas bete, antoine.
J'essaie de lui dire que c'est une mauvaise idee.
You can cut me in half if you want to...
And i can learn more.
I can do the egg trick.
Anything you want me to do.
Quiet down, albert.
You rest now, ok?
Doucement, doucement.
I take off your shoes, ok?
Now rest.
Rest.
And later, we will take you for hot cakes, ok?
But we have to call your godmother.
I want to stay with you.
You cannot stay with us.
Is impossible.
But we love you very, very much.
Mm-Hmm, but is impossible.
Now sleep.
Sleep.
Oh, magic...sleep.
Now, you sleep.
Sleep.
No more troubles.
Just peaceful sleep.
Hush.
Sleep. Hush, hush.
Hush.
Fermez les yeux.
Close your eyes.
Shh. Hush.
Sleep.
Hush.
Bogus?
Bogus?
I'm here.
I'm not going back.
Shh.
Yes, you will.
You have to be strong.
She comes for you.
I want my mom.
I know.
I want to find her.
I want to go to your world.
But I'm not real.
I am imagination.
I am...bogus.
I don't care.
I don't want to be here.
Take me to where you come from.
It's not a real place.
It's dangerous.
You get lost... and never come back.
I'm going, and you can't stop me!
Albert!
Albert, come back!
Albert!
Albert, albert!
Come back!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Please welcome the one, the only...
The great albertini!
Watch, because i am about to confound you.
Mom?
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Come back!
He's been here since we came off the stage.
He's anyway totally exhausted.
Of course he's exhausted.
Who the hell sells a bus ticket to a little boy?
Aren't people paying attention out there?
Shh. Don't wake him.
Watch him twitch... I think he dreams.
There's something strange.
How come a little boy like that
Can run away in the middle of the night?
He's homesick.
I still don't understand.
You don't have to understand
Because I'm his godmother.
I'm taking him home.
Whether you want to or not.
I don't recall getting any phone calls.
You guys never even checked to see where the hell he was.
What about the...
Ok, little guy.
Up we go.
All right.
Ok.
We're home.
Now we'll get into bed.
It'll be great.
Oh, albert, i know we got off to a rough start,
But you're just going to have to understand
This is where you live now.
This is your home.
You know?
But, it's probably too late to be talking about this.
We can talk about it over breakfast in the morning.
You know, i'll make you some french toast from scratch
'Cause i know you like french stuff.
And maybe...Maybe i can find some real syrup...
You know, the kind they have from real trees.
I'm sure they must have some somewhere.
You feel a little bit cold.
Maybe i should make you some soup, huh?
He doesn't need soup.
Yeah, i'll make you a little bit of soup.
You know, your mom loved soup.
There you go.
And you? You're supposed to be his best friend.
Where were you?
Why would you let him go to atlantic city like that?
You're ok? Good.
You know, bogus, you ought to start doing your job.
I do my job?
Do your job.
You don't do it well enough as far as I'm concerned,
Because i do my job.
I do the best that i can.
What more can i do?
I got albertitis.
I'm talking to myself.
No. You are talking to bogus.
I'm talking to bogus?
Bogus is an imaginary character on some little boy's wall.
You're not real.
No. It's time to see me, harriet.
See you?
I don't see anything.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Where?
Here, harriet.
Just behind you.
Don't be afraid.
Try.
I'm here.
Believe, harriet, and you will see.
I'm waiting.
Aah!
Don't be afraid!
Stop, harriet.
Don't be afraid.
There's a big white man in my kitchen!
Get out of here!
Get away from me!
No, no, no!
Harriet!
I'm a part of you, harriet.
No. Go away.
You are such a difficult woman.
I said, go away.
How can i go away?
Like this.
Oh!
Oh, you want to play dirty?
Ow! Stop that!
That hurt.
What's the matter with you?
I said i didn't want to play.
You have to play.
I don't have to play with you!
This is all your fault, you know that?
If not for you, this little boy would be fine.
It's better I'm here.
You need me, harriet.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I need a big imaginary frenchman
Who comes in and messes up my life?
No. This is nuts.
No, it's not nuts.
Is imagination.
Where is your imagination, harriet?
My imagination is fine.
I see you, don't i?
Oh, there is more to see.
Oh, really?
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
All right, so i should play with this
Because really what you are
Is some little acorn in my stomach
That i ate from some damn doughnut.
Sort of, yes.
And there's 3 of you?
Is there a past, present, and future?
Yes.
Oh, i see. Ok.
So at the end, you're going to show me
How good a person i can be,
And in the beginning, you're going to show me
What a sad little girl i was, aren't you?
You're going to take me back
And show me the little harriet who used to sit around
And wait for people to come and play with her
And wait for mail from her mother, and nobody ever wrote.
You going to sit around, you going to explain that to me?
I understand.
I've been waiting for that.
Really?
Yeah.
Where were you?
Where were you when i needed you?
When i was little?
I was there.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Right.
This little boy doesn't even like me.
Oh, yeah?
No.
He would like the harriet i see.
The true harriet.
La vraie.
The one who is gentle.
Not afraid to play.
Not afraid to love.
Not afraid to trust.
The real harriet would dance...
With a clumsy frenchman... if he asked her?
It's time to bring albert back.
Tell him you see me.
Albert?
Hey, albert?
I saw him.
Albert?
Albert!
Albert!
God.
Albert.
I'm coming, boy.
Albert?
Albert.
Albert?
Come on, take my hand.
Come on.
Albert?
Go to harriet.
Come on, albert.
I'm right here.
Ugh!
Albert!
You can do it.
Go on.
That's right.
That's it.
Go on, albert.
Take her hand. Reach.
Come on.
Take her hand.
You can do it.
Take my hand.
Come on.
You can do it, albert.
Come on, one more step.
Come on.
Don't be scared.
Come on. Yeah.
All right, i got you.
Come on, give me your other hand.
Oh, all right.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.
Oh.
Oh.
Listen, the next time you decide to run away,
Do it on the ground, ok?
I don't want to run away.
Good.
'Cause i don't want you to.
Tell him you want him here.
I want you here.
I need you.
I really need you.
Tell her you need her, too.
I need you, too.
Good.
'Cause i want to try to make us into a family, ok?
Tell her you want that, too.
Me, too.
I'll try to be a good mother.
That's pushing it.
I'll try.
You hungry?
Uh-Huh.
Good.
And now the soup.
Come on.
You know, your mom did this to me once.
My mom ran away?
Yeah. She used to run away all the time.
Really?
Come on, albert.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
You can't run through a graveyard.
Stop, boy, stop!
Pow!
Got you.
I tried to be nice, albert, but you wouldn't listen.
Got you.
Oh. I think you got me through the heart.
That was a good one, harriet!
Albert, slow down!
Come on, harriet!
Au revoir.
Well, it's funny.
When they need us, we are there.
Big "hello," big "let's be friends
That never parts forever and forever."
But when it's done... poof! We disappear.
They never say good-Bye.
They never see us go.
Oh, sometimes they remember us...later.
Maybe not.
But...i cannot complain.
It's my job, you know.
Whoo!
Oh, by the way...
If you need me, i am available, hmm?
âª anyone can see we're good together âª
âª we're a perfect match âª

Over the water and across the sea... 
on a little island
off the Carolinas... 
there once lived a young girl
with a great gift... 
who thought she knew it all. 
That's me. 
Folks call me Marina, 
and I'm a clairvoyant. 
I've always known what people desire
long before they do... 
and that's just a gift
I was born with. 
Of course, I was always
on the watch for my other half... 
what Grammy d'Arbo
calls your split-apart. 
Mind you, I had my suitors... 
but I was waiting for the signs
to let me know the right one... 
a zigzag rainbow... 
a bolt of lightning
ripping through the sky... 
the usual things
that tell you love's at hand. 
As the years went by, 
I grew fevered with anticipation. 
Grammy told me it was hormones. 
But I knew love
had to be on its way... 
and I could hardly wait
for my journey to begin. 
First, a twin-tailed comet
crossed my path... 
and I was sure
love could not be far behind. 
Next thing I know, 
a magical gift washed up on shore... 
promising travel
to a faraway place. 
And then thejumping mullet fish
yielded up a wedding band... 
an undeniable sign that
I'd soon meet my mate. 
And then one night, 
I saw him in my dream. 
Well, just part of him, actually... 
but what a part. 
It was a lustrous, glowing smile. 
Grammy d'Arbo said you
can tell nothing from a smile... 
unless, of course, you're a dentist. 
Truth be told, I'd had
just about enough of her wisdom. 
I knew what I had seen
in my dream... 
the smile of my split-apart. 
And he'd be coming over the water
and across the sea... 
the man of my dreams. 
My Adonis. 
My Poseidon. 
No. No, my Zeus. 
Which is why I must admit
I was a mite surprised... 
when the tides washed in
my husband-to-be Leo Lemke. 
Grammy d'Arbo always said love
is the leap that won't be denied. 
And what a leap I made... 
from my little island to his. 
Kids, don't waste the water!
You little bastards!
I'll make sausage out of ya!
Ladies, could you help me, please?
Molly, Gina, this is my bride, Marina Lemke.
Bride?
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Leo. You'll get a hernia.
Love's made a young man of me.
No peeking, now.
No peeking.
It's for wrapping the meat.
That's right! You always got to wear an apron. Always.
And you'll be working here, behind the counter.
- It's fragile.
- Sorry.
The most important part of the business... keeping the customer satisfied.
Oh, Leo, you're back.
Hey, Harper, you're holding me up?
Oh. This?
The writers decided that Harper's gonna kill somebody next week.
Of course, they haven't decided whom.
But I decided I'd start working with the weapon... so I'd be more in-the-moment when it comes.
Honey, this is Robyn Graves.
She's Harper on Our Daily Bread. 
- Big TV star.
- Well, hardly.
And this is Marina Lemke... my wife.
Pleased to meet ya.
Your wife?
I mean, my God.
Congratulations.
That's wonderful.
Leo, you sneaky devil.
You didn't even tell me you were seeing anybody.
So...
I was just showing Marina around the shop.
- We're not really open.
- Oh, no, Leo.
You got to help me, please. Please?
I got some stuff in the freezer if you want.
- Just something for the barbecue.
- Let me see what I can do ya.
So Leo married.
And you too. That's great.
- When did you two meet?
- Two days ago.
You're kidding.
Oh, that's so brave.
I mean, it's just that it seems so sudden.
- How did you know he was the one?
- I dreamed about him.
Oh, God.
I wish I got some answers when I'm asleep.
All I ever dream about is being on stage naked... which is so textbook I'm embarrassed to tell my boyfriend about it.
- He's a shrink.
- Shrink?
Psychiatrist.
And I know that he wishes...
I had more complicated dreams, so...
I make 'em up sometimes.
Maybe I could borrow yours.
"Honey, I dreamed
I was at my wedding last night... and you were the one.
The one and only."
How will I ever know for sure?
Oh, you'll know.
There's love waiting for you behind a friendly face.
There'll be big changes... and a nice surprise... but don't be scared of it.
Just stand up to it.
Destiny has a way of working itself out.
That's what Grandma d'Arbo always says.
Then Alex is it.
I think you're right.
I think we've both been just fooling ourselves... with all this talk about shared independence... when basically at heart...
I am an old-fashioned girl.
- I could just die...
- Here you go, sweetheart.
A couple of London broils. You can defrost them in the microwave.
Thanks, Leo.
You know, your wife...
Is something special, all right.
Robyn, we've been driving all day... and this is our first night home together.
We got to close up now.
Oh, God.
How insensitive of me.
Okay.
- Leo, what do I owe you?
- You can pay me next time.
- I don't got any change.
- Oh, hey.
Thank you. We'll talk?
Looking towards it.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Honey... how come you told her all that stuff?
Just thought she might want to know.
Welcome back!
I hear congratulations are in order.
Hey, Doc!
Meet my new bride, Marina.
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
I was just careless.
Yeah.
- I hope you have enough space.
- Oh, plenty.
You know, I wasn't expecting to bring home a new wife.
That thing's awful loud.
I got a brand-new digital alarm clock from the bank.
Want me to put this in the living room?
Oh, no. This clock's been with my family since heaven started.
- It's a perpetual motion clock.
- There's no such thing.
Well, sure.
Grandma d'Arbo says those ticks are the heartbeat of a marriage... two hearts beating as one.
That's nice, honey.
Don't you go anywhere.
You can't beat Bessie.
Who's that?
Oh, Bessie Smith... the empress of the blues.
- How come it sounds so scratchy?
- It's an original pressing.
Very rare.
No one's ever wanted me to dance with them before.
- I can't believe that.
- Well, it's the truth.
This town is just crackling with current.
I'm never going to get to sleep.
I was thinking... maybe you could take me out to meet some of the neighbors.
We got to get up early tomorrow.
We got a big delivery coming.
I think it's going to be late arriving.
Something... Cracked axle.
- I'm getting good at this.
- You sure are.
So what do you say?
I say I'm one lucky butcher.
I'm sure glad I found you.
I found you.
I'm sorry. It's just, you took me by surprise.
I thought our next decision is living together, not marriage.
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
The butcher's wife.
What?
Leo's wife.
I've been to a lot of clairvoyants in my time... and this one is the real thing.
She's a very wise woman.
I could tell.
Leo's married to a clairvoyant?
And she told me...
"Love is waiting for you behind a friendly face.
Don't be scared of it.
You can stand up to it."
Where the hell did Leo meet a gypsy?
Alex, do you want to get married or not?
- Before we answer that question...
- Oh, God.
Sit down.
If she's going to have such a profound effect on us...
I'd like to know more about her.
- Could we get off her and on to us?
- I'm concerned.
No, curious. Yes.
If you're going to talk about getting married... why would you approach some strange woman in a butcher shop?
Why wouldn't you just come to me?
Forget it! Just forget it!
I should've told you I dreamed it.
We'd be at the altar by now.
- Can we talk about this rationally?
- No.
Can you fight like a man instead of a shrink?
All I am trying to say is that marriage is an inspired decision.
And I told you I'm uncomfortable with the term "shrink."
Shrink!
"We are all in the gutter... but some of us are looking at the stars."
Who'd have done that?
- It's beautiful.
- It's vandalism.
I could wash it off for a couple of bucks.
Don't you want to let it stay put?
What?
Well, what would it hurt?
We got some chores around the shop, if you're handy with a broom.
- We do?
- Sure.
We've got that big delivery arriving late this afternoon.
This morning.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Excuse me.
I know this kid. He's trouble.
No, I don't see that.
Maybe a little misunderstood.
He could use a job.
What do you say?
Hey, what are you waiting for?
Get in here before he changes his mind.
Eugene, come on out here!
Just come on out here!
I want you to go out and sweep out the back room.
- Right now?
- No. Tomorrow.
And a dollar and a quarter.
You stop back soon.
Thanks. I will.
Love your window.
It's so original.
Thank you. See ya later.
Afternoon, Dr. Tremor.
What would you be needing?
I'm just looking for someone.
He's in the back.
I wouldn't fret yourself none over Eugene.
- He's a good boy.
- Of course he's a good boy.
Doctor, Leo said the chops are real nice today.
Good. I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
Sorry, Doc.
I'm on the clock.
Then I'll just take a moment of your time.
It's okay. Go on.
Eugene, what are you doing?
- I'm sweeping out the bad luck.
- What?
It's a sedge broom from Ocracoke.
That's an island off the coast of North Carolina, where I'm from.
Will you excuse us for a moment?
Eugene...
- Did you forget our appointment?
- I got a job now.
I don't need a shrink anymore.
I don't think he likes being called that.
I'm sorry.
- Hey, Doc. How's it going?
- I'm fine. Thanks, Leo.
Just trying to have a chat with Eugene, if that's all right.
Sure, sure.
Take your time.
Honey, what are you doing cutting up all those chops?
We'll have no place to put them when the delivery truck shows up.
I don't see that as a problem.
They won't be arriving today.
- They called?
- No, not yet.
- I'm really getting good at this.
- I thought we had an agreement.
You were going to see me until the end of the summer... before we decided whether you need a shrink... psychiatrist.
That was an agreement that you and my probation officer made.
I'm just a troubled kid, Doc.
Who's been telling you that?
You're no trouble at all.
Eugene, I am thrilled you found a job.
It's a positive move, but I don't think it precludes therapy.
We've still got some things to talk about.
Honey, those chops are gonna dry out.
Nobody's gonna want to buy them tomorrow.
It's all in the rhythm, isn't it?
Out of my way, asshole.
Oh, thank God you're open.
He's standing there with that little-boy-lost look.
"I'm an artist, so it's cool if my right brain's oatmeal.
Did Jackson Pollack remember to bring home veal chops?"
I said,
"Cut it out, Julian.
That stopped being cute the day you got out of art school.
I pay for the food!
You can pick it up!"
So now I've got a sit-down dinner for 24 influential critics... and art dealers in less than three hours.
I'm hoping one will discover the bugger and take him off my hands.
Of course you're thinking,
"It's her fault.
What kind of sane woman gets involved with a man... with pretensions to paint?"
But I'm throwing myself on your mercy.
I need veal chops.
Lots of them. Now.
- What's this?
- Veal chops. Lots of them. Now.
How'd you do that?
- Oh, great window.
- Bye.
Yeah. How did she do that?
Eugene, why don't you stop by tonight at 6:00?
We'll talk about this choice.
Don't worry, Doctor.
I'll take good care of him.
I appreciate that, Mrs. Lemke.
Say hey to your gal for me.
Oh, that's right.
You and Robyn had a brief... or, shall we say, influential, encounter.
I'm curious, Mrs. Lemke.
Why would you suggest we get married?
What I say and what people hear aren't always the same thing.
Don't you find that in your calling, Doctor?
I never told your sweetheart to marry with you.
I can see you sparking to her.
A man like you needs someone bigger than life itself.
But she's not gonna be the one you'll settle with.
Could you give me a hand?
Yes. Sure.
Thanks.
Can I offer you a little professional advice?
A scholar like you?
I'd be honored.
Good.
I believe in female intuition,
Mrs. Lemke, to an extent...
It's just a specific manifestation of the collective unconscious... but you might want to be careful about ordering your life... or anyone else's for that matter... on such a primitive instinct.
I'll keep that in mind.
Good. Good.
Would you get the door?
Eugene, I'll see you later.
That boy's tongue's long enough to cut his throat.
I was going to say that.
Honey, it's for...
You want to get that?
Lemke's.
What do you mean you can't get here?
I need the goddamn beef today!
I better take my mess out of here.
- What? A cracked axle?
- Eugene, mind the store.
You bet.
Wash your hands before you touch that meat.
Hi, girls.
How are you today?
Good, real good.
Just out for a stroll.
I don't think
I've seen you here before.
I just moved up here with my husband.
Maybe you know him.
His name's Leo Lemke.
The butcher?
Hi. Let me know if you need help.
Well, actually, I do.
I'm looking for something dowdy and plain.
What's the occasion?
A church recital.
"Lead us not into temptation."
It's so glamorous.
You know, with your hair done up and some nice shoes...
Been a while since you were in church.
I see you wearing this at a nightclub... and you're standing in front of a room full of people... and you're... and you're singing.
You could always frump these up with pearls and pumps.
I'll take this one.
How much are these?
Those are 350.
I think I got that.
This is three.
I got the change.
There you go.
I got to get back to work.
Thank ya.
See ya later.
I think I've made a breakthrough.
I'm gonna sing the blues.
Sing the blues.
What exactly does that mean to you?
A lounge act.
Actually, I met this wonderful woman... in a clothing store... and I don't remember exactly what she said... but it feels right.
I'm gonna sing.
All right.
You feel you'd like to sing.
But why do you think a clerk in a clothing store... is having such a profound effect on you?
No, no.
She's not a clerk.
I think she works in the butcher's shop... or something, but... she is so wise.
Stella... a woman as intelligent and insightful as yourself... doesn't need some clairvoyant to tell you how to live your life.
That's why we're here.
Do you really think she's clairvoyant?
- Hi.
- Good evening.
Who did that to your window?
Maybe I should do something like that at the store.
About those shoes...
Oh, they are so cozy.
You're working in them?
What's that for?
Supper... for you and a friend.
Friends I got plenty of.
It's love that's left me wanting.
Well, don't despair.
It takes as long as it takes.
What?
It bothers Leo when I get to talking this way.
There's two faces.
No, it's one face with two sides.
On one side... there's violence.
But not to her. It's...
It's just to men who've treated her unkindly.
On the other... she's looking for love... but she's confused...
'cause she... well, 'cause she's just looking for... she's just looking for it in the wrong house.
God love her.
I can't wait.
You just stick close to your front porch.
You're gonna be cooking for two real soon.
Hey, do you think my husband would like me in something like that?
I mean, it's just so sophisticated, and... you know.
No.
I think you look great.
What do I owe you?
Oh, goodness, nothing.
It's a gift.
Thanks.
- Thanks.
- See ya later.
Marina, there's a lot of nuts in this city.
You don't want people thinking you're one of them.
So, how about, like... no more of this hocus-pocus talk, huh?
Goodness, Leo, I'm just trying to help out.
Honey, we're in the business of selling meat, not giving advice.
I got to tell you, it's giving me the creeps.
How come?
I...
You...
I got to go get a drink.
Hey, Leo.
I just heard the news.
How's married life?
Hit me, Luis, hard.
Darling!
Honey!
Come over here, sweetheart.
Molly, Gina.
How are you ladies this evening?
Fine. Come.
Sit down. It's for you.
Thank you.
So... how's love everlasting?
Oh, we're just smoothing out the creases.
Everything has a way of working itself out, doesn't it?
A wedding present.
You need a mojo.
It's a sack of charms.
Some herbs, dried flowers, a little spice.
Some roots, nut shells, spider webs, candle wax.
Personally, I like cumin.
Yeah?
You use cumin?
I never use cumin.
Goat's hair is nice.
It helps clear up the vision, so what you see is...
What you end up getting.
Exactly.
Thank you, ladies.
You know, though... what's meant to be just can't be changed.
Hard times demand an open mind.
Wear it.
Nice shoes, Alex.
Jackie Gleason collection?
You like 'em?
By the way, I can't go away with you and Robyn next weekend.
What do you mean you can't go away next weekend?
Something came up.
I rented this house five months ago.
I've been looking forward to this weekend together.
It was unexpected.
We're supposed to relax and have fun, goddamn it.
I scheduled you a blind date for Saturday night.
I already have a date, thank you.
Oh, that's something else.
- Bring her along.
- I don't know who she is yet.
- I'm curious.
- Oh, no.
No, no.
You have a date with somebody... but you don't know who it is.
- Shut up and putt.
- No.
I'm always interested when my friends show... early signs of dementia praecox.
Listen, Alex...
I know it sounds flaky, but I met this wonderful woman... and she says I'll be cooking for two soon... and I really want to believe her.
- Believe who?
- The butcher's wife.
I knew that one day... 
one day... 
I ran from you, Chauncey, 
as far as I could. 
So why do I keep ending up
back in your arms? 
Because that's where
you were meant to be... 
safe and warm
in my sweet embrace. 
Come to Uncle Chauncey, 
my little passion flower. 
I only want
what's best for us. 
I told you one of us
would end up hurt. 
Why does everything
I touch die? 
It's the gun, sweetheart.
- The gun.
- One little box he brings down!
A big man like that, he brings one box! One teeny little box!
Let's load this thing up!
I can't believe it.
It's an awfully long distance from Georgia.
Hey, Eugene.
I got this thing for you, and I wanted to give it to you.
I wanted you to open it here.
- Thanks.
- Just a little present... but it means something special to me, and I wanted to give it to you.
Eugene, she's beautiful.
Come here.
I named her Rosalita.
She's so sweet.
Hey, Rosalita.
You like her?
Oh, she's beautiful.
Thank you so much.
Eugene, you're late!
Get your butt in gear now!
Go on.
Leo, if you want to pass words with me... will you please not take it out on him?
Bless you.
Are you wearing some new kind of perfume?
I think you may be allergic to my new mojo.
Let me get you a tissue.
- Here you go.
- What the hell is that?
Oh, this is Rosalita.
Isn't she sweet?
What do you want with a live chicken?
No, don't tell me.
Don't... Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
Don't say nothing.
Just don't.
It's just a little chick.
I never thought I'd see the inside of a shrink's office.
It looks so normal.
I was expecting something a little more psycho.
Pervy, you know?
Uh-huh.
How can I help you, Leo?
I don't need help.
I'm normal.
It's my wife.
I mean, I know we've only been married for a couple of days... but I think she might be nuts, if you know what I mean.
Yes.
I think I have an idea.
Though "nuts" isn't a word
I'm comfortable with.
Me neither.
See, we got married real quick, like the day we met.
She insisted.
Swear to God, she told me
I was the man of her dreams.
I had no idea she really meant it.
So we took some holy vows.
I believe a man is only as good as his vows... but now I think maybe she married me
'cause of these dreams of hers.
She believes in 'em, Doc.
It's not natural.
It could be some sort of complex in her head, right?
Which means she's nuts.
And if she's nuts, how do I even know if she loves me?
So I'm thinking... dreams, nuts...
Sounds like your field.
And she's really spooking me now, Doc.
She's got some live chicken running around... and she's wearing some hojo around her neck.
You gotta cure her, or we're in big trouble.
Doc, I been to Brooklyn.
I know about voodoo.
Hey, Leo.
- Where's the new missus?
- She's fine, thanks.
I said where.
Never mind.
Make sure she gets this, okay?
Yeah, sure.
So when you going to give it to her?
- Don't worry.
- Do I look worried?
It's a love token.
It'll seal your love forever.
Jesus.
Oh, Mrs. Lemke.
Did I...
Oh, boy. Did, I...
Did I leave the door unlocked?
Where's the couch?
I don't use a couch.
I don't know if you've ever been in therapy before.
- That's my chair.
- Oh, it is?
Well, it's nice.
It's important you know... that I can be of absolutely no help... unless you want to be here.
You, of course, are free to go at any time.
I promised Leo I'd come.
Good. Why?
Well, I expect he thinks
I'm a little touched.
"Touched"? Interesting word.
What exactly does it mean to you?
Well, that's a fine question.
I reckon it's 'cause I know things before he does... and that just gives him the shivers.
Yes.
Well, come on.
Women have been burned for less.
So you know things.
Like telling a total stranger that she should... get up in front of a crowd and sing... when she might not be ready for such a bold move... and is liable to get terribly discouraged.
You know Stella?
Or telling a lonely woman that she should wait for love to find her... when she'd be better off getting out there and finding...
But that's all true.
Or telling my girlfriend that she should marry me.
Now, here we go again.
No. People...
I can't help what I see, can I?
But you can help what you say.
Do you have visions?
Do you hear voices?
Premonitions?
Do you roller-skate?
How exactly does roller-skating figure into your gift?
Oh, it doesn't.
I just wanted to have a little fun.
Yeah, well, it is highly unorthodox to leave the office with a patient.
I'm not your patient, Doctor.
I'm doing it for Leo.
If you want to hear how crazy I am, you better just lace up.
What am I doing here?
Some crazy woman in the clothing store put me up to this.
No wonder I'm in therapy.
I'm too impressionable.
Don't you think?
You'll be great.
If only I were black,
I'd feel so much better.
Luis, rye and soda.
Hold the soda.
Make it a double.
I don't want to talk about women... and I don't want to talk about my wife.
Oh, you're married?
Leo, this is Stella Kefauver, our new lounge act.
She's gonna class up the joint.
You got your work cut out for you.
Hit me again, Luis.
Bessie Smith?
You sing Bessie Smith?
A skinny little thing like you?
- Okay, I'll sing the Debby Boone.
- No, no, no.
I love Bessie.
Stella, you're on.
You're welcome.
You been holding out on me, Luis?
What do you think?
Good evening.
For my first selection...
I would like to sing
"In the Dark."
In the dark
It's just... 
Sorry.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Oh, boy.
In the dark
It's just you and I
Not a sound
There's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark
But soon
This dance will be ending
And we're gonna be missed
Gee
But I'm not pretending
'Cause I swear it's fun
Fun to be kissed
Oh, in the dark
Now we will find
What the rest
Have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
In the dark
Boy, I miss the wind.
You know, no wind will make you stale.
You were going to explain to me... about the mechanics of your clairvoyance.
You know, it's so good to cut loose.
Yeah. It sure is.
Mrs. Lemke, come on.
I promised your husband.
Please.
Okay.
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.
It's like you're standing in the middle of a doughnut.
And depending on which way you turn, you can tell... what's going on in folks' lives.
If you lean one way, it's like "whoosh."
You just catch a piece of the past.
And if you turn yourself a bit... you'll bump right into the future.
But it's like somebody's running me my own private picture show... in stops and starts.
I'm curious.
What do you mean, "picture show"?
Here. Give me your hands.
Well, there's the sea... and your little naked body... and you're curling your toes up in the sand.
White flowers at a funeral.
Your mama.
She's real glad that she gave you that red drum set.
And there you are, barely six.
You've got these red bumps all over... and they're just making you itch.
You just want to scratch.
Seven.
I was...
I was seven.
Move me again
because I don't care
Move me 'cause I don't care
Luis, champagne for Mrs. Kefauver.
Miss. And call me Stella.
Champagne? What do you think this is, the Copa?
We got Bud Light on draft.
Stella, you are music to my ears.
Gorgeous.
You sing like an angel.
A choir of angels.
Thank you so much.
You are some sort of singer, lady.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You know, I hear your songs... and I get pictures in my head.
All soft and dreamy.
Like the movies.
Leo, do you really think so?
There aren't many of us that like blues. We got to stick together.
I'd like that.
This ain't the kind of place
I imagined you working at.
You imagined me?
Yeah. Sure.
But I always thought you blues singers... slept all day and stayed out all night.
- And lived in Paris.
- Yeah.
I know.
And now I'm here teaching holy music to pimply-faced kids.
So, Leo... what's on your mind?
I got to tell you something.
Sure. Anything.
It's about my wife.
The thing is...
I don't think we got married for the right reasons.
It seemed to make sense when she proposed, but... I don't know.
Maybe I just don't know how to be her husband.
Since I brought her back here, nothing's been working out.
Maybe it's just not meant to be.
No. She keeps telling me
I'm the man she was meant to marry.
The thing is...
Stella, I know it's not right, but...
I got this feeling for you.
I got the same feeling too.
But my wife... she's so fragile.
It would send her right off the deep end.
A short trip for her.
You're right.
We'll have a higher love.
We won't wallow in the degradation of earthly desires.
Jesus, you even talk like an angel.
A toad.
I don't know what to say.
How...
How thoughtful.
It's hard to get your bearings when you can't even see the stars.
Yes. Yes.
The other night, you were looking for the stars... in your nightgown.
You were watching me?
Last week I saw something
I still don't believe... and I've studied the stars since I was a kid.
I saw a twin-tailed comet just... right in.
Really? Me too.
That was my definite sign that love was on its way.
How exactly did you come to marry Leo?
I was supposed to marry Leo.
I knew it when I saw his smile in my dreams.
He's my split-apart.
What's a split-apart?
Long ago before man and woman... when time was young, there were these beings.
- Beans?
- Beings.
Oh. Beings.
Yeah.
Right.
So we were kind of odd-looking... but just as happy as pigs in a puddle... and we didn't need no one for nothing, and...
And we could reproduce by ourselves and... Yeah.
You don't know this story.
- You can't.
- I do. I do.
Go ahead. Try me.
Okay.
The spirits that ruled the world then...
Envied our joy and independence.
And so they split us apart.
Like clams on a half shell and then scattered us to the wind.
You can still see the scar... which, of course, is the... navel.
Right.
The bellybutton.
You were saying.
So we're the kinfolk of these old split-aparts... and mostly we're miserable on account of we spend our lives...
Iooking for our long-lost other half.
And sometimes... getting so caught up in that search for that special person that... they don't even notice.
Boom, there they are.
Right before their very eyes.
- How'd you know this?
- Magic.
I never would've thought you had it in ya.
Actually, everybody knows it.
It's Plato.
It's a corruption, of course, but Plato nonetheless.
Well, my grammy told it to me.
She must be well-read.
Blind since birth.
I've never met anyone quite like you, Mrs. Lemke.
You ought to get out more.
And you can call me Marina.
Marina... It's pretty.
It's pretty.
Look, Marina.
Fooling yourself into believing you married Leo... because your grammy screwed up Plato, that's... that's dangerous territory.
Well, I appreciate your concern, Doctor... but I wouldn't expect a man like you to understand.
Oh, no, I do understand.
And I want you to understand, because your impulsive behavior... is jeopardizing your marriage.
- Perhaps Leo just showed up...
- He didn't just show up.
How the hell you think he got to Ocracoke in the first place?
- I suggested he take a vacation.
- It was his destiny.
Mrs. Lemke, these delusions are not healthy.
- I can help...
- You know what? You don't know zip... about love or life, Doctor... and I don't need you strewing your learning all over me.
Do not walk away from this!
These fantasies...
Your fantasies of being all-seeing and all-powerful are dangerous... and they're...
It's just a hell of a way to run your life!
My God, you didn't dream
Leo into your life...
Of course I did.
I just made a mistake.
It's all right.
It's okay. That's...
Awareness is the first and most difficult step.
Honestly, I...
I understand what it's like to think you know everything.
It's really terrible.
I've made a wreck... of Leo's life and my life and two innocent strangers.
I've really got to go figure this out... and... fix it.
You ended up skating in the park with a patient.
It's classic countertransference.
You allowed her to manipulate you into a vulnerable... never mind unprofessional... situation... where she controlled you.
This is freshman psychology, Alex.
Oh, good. Oh, good. Good.
Dr. Tremor... don't blow a great career on a cute piece of ass.
You keep your dick in your pants... your id in check... and you remember that we have a mission... in this world.
Did you sleep well?
I didn't hear you come in last night.
I didn't want to wake you.
Lend me a hand with this?
It's stuck.
Are you trying to tell me something?
No.
You trying to tell me something?
No.
Say it with flowers?
For the first time...
I can almost imagine a world without therapy.
Amen.
Well, I'm glad our time together is having such a positive effect.
It's been good, but I owe this one to that psychic.
I thought we dealt with that.
Don't worry. It's not like
I'm cured or anything.
Good.
Well, not good...
Forgive me, Doctor, for I have sinned.
But he is such a good man, and I think he really likes me.
Is he married?
Well, yes. But... his wife's not well... which, of course, fills me with guilt.
But she's making him miserable, so I rationalize... by figuring that...
I'm bringing some well-earned joy to his life.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
I'm curious.
Oh, no. You wouldn't be if you knew him.
I mean, this is it.
You always know when the right person walks into your life.
I always know when the wrong person walks in... and it doesn't feel that way at all, so...
I'm sure Leo's the one.
Leo?
That's his name... Leo.
I really think you'd like him.
- Here's your hot dogs.
- No, no, sweetheart. Chops.
- Chops.
- Chops.
Great sign.
Really makes you want to come in here.
- Oh. It's you.
- Hi.
I didn't know you worked here.
- How'd that dress work out?
- Great.
Everything's working out great.
Thanks to you, I'm singing at this cabaret. Dellago's?
Oh, I know that place.
My husband likes it.
Okay, it's a bar.
But I met this really wonderful man.
Hey, maybe you can tell me if we're going to...
Oh, no. Never mind.
I don't want to know.
Just pray for me.
Pray for all of us, darling.
Would it be all right if I put up a flyer?
Well, sure. I'd be proud.
I've got to tell Leo to get up there to see you.
He just loves that old stuff.
Leo?
My husband.
That'll be 10.
Well, see ya.
Uh, 10.
I've got to find a wife for my husband.
Why not?
Thanks.
Out of my way, asshole.
Guess.
Would you fancy meeting a cuddly middle-aged man?
Sorry. I like them young and talented.
I never go on dates arranged by my butcher... but I'd be interested in meeting the artist who did your window.
Is he young?
Take my card.
Your change.
What I wouldn't give for just a little breeze.
Not till September at the earliest.
So now you're doing the weather?
The face of God is a one-way mirror.
You're not listening to me!
I knew it!
You're absolutely correct, and I apologize.
Excuse me.
You're still not listening to me.
- Leo.
- You're in. Good.
What the hell did you do to my wife?
- I am with a patient.
- Your fruitcake can wait. Mine can't.
You got her trying to fix me up with strange women.
I don't know what kind of advice you're giving out... but a few more visits with you, we can book her a room in Bellevue!
Wait a second!
I am not...
Just stay the hell away from her, okay?
You're a dangerous man.
- Your clock's stuck.
- I don't want to talk about it!
Where's Alex?
He's seeing some lunatic.
Doctor's wife is not one of my featured roles.
God, Grace, what am I going to do?
- What?
- I proposed to him the other night.
- No.
- Yes.
I can't believe it either, but I met the most incredible woman.
She just opened my eyes.
Me too.
Oh, yeah?
You're seeing someone new?
No. This new girl that works at the butcher shop.
My God. Marina.
She's incredible.
- Is she for real?
- Absolutely.
- What did she tell you?
- To stick close to my front porch.
That's why I canceled my weekend with you guys... to wait for my mystery date.
Hey.
You think I'm nuts?
Grace, that's fabulous.
Alex thinks I'm insane.
It's his favorite diagnosis.
Why do we waste our time with men?
Not all of us do.
Oh, Chauncey, don't touch me there.
Mrs. Lemke.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I need to see you.
- Oh, well...
- Now.
Why don't we just go to my office?
Okay.
I was going to talk to you in the morning.
We need to...
We need to be clear about last night.
I acted inappropriately.
I never should have seen you under duress.
That was unprofessional.
I never should have allowed the session to leave the office.
- That was inexcusable.
- Doctor...
Worst of all, I had no business offering you... a quick-fix analysis of your marriage.
Dr. Tremor,
I saw you in my dreams tonight.
Oh, sure.
That's not uncommon.
Dreams are important.
And you know... you can keep a little notebook by the bed... and just write them down if you're afraid of...
What was I doing?
Smiling.
Look, Mrs. Lemke...
Marina.
All right, listen.
I can't deny that I feel an attraction for you.
But don't worry.
I know what it is... and how to remedy the situation.
There's no cure. Last night, just for a moment, you knew it.
Love is the leap that won't be denied.
No, no.
This isn't love.
This is what we doctors like to call...
I'll think of it.
Countertransference!
You're not listening to me.
Yes, I am, and I understand exactly... why you're doing this.
You do?
Yes.
To get even.
What for?
Because you're angry at your husband for commencing an extramarital affair.
What?
Yes.
Leo's seeing another woman?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.
Well, if he was, I would.
Who is she?
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that.
I can't believe he's seeing another woman.
My God, we've only been married, what, three days?
Marina, last night, you yourself said you'd made a mistake.
Yes, but it was my mistake... and I was doing the fixing.
And I'm gonna be the one deciding who my husband should marry.
Honey, we got to talk.
I heard you yesterday, you know, when you were talking.
So I suppose I've been wasting my time trying to find you the right wife.
Of course you are, honey.
I've got a good wife.
And we can work things out.
Don't worry.
- I may be simple, but I'm not stupid.
- What's that supposed to mean?
I suppose lying and cheating ain't in your vocabulary.
Another day, another dollar.
Eugene, I want that money back in the till.
What's a till?
You know I know. You want to borrow money, that's one thing.
- But I've got no time for thieving.
- Honey.
- What are you talking about?
- We're $50 short from last night.
Honey, is this what you're looking for?
Why don't you get a couch, Doc?
I need some advice.
You remember I was telling you about that girl I like?
Right.
She's got one of these "Sybil" things going now.
One day she treats me like I'm Romeo... the next day she treats me like I'm public enemy number one.
I can't figure it out.
The female psyche has eluded men since the beginning of time, Eugene.
Nice tone, Doc.
Feeling hostile?
Yes... No.
- We're not here to talk about me.
- That's right. It's my dime.
I'm thinking about my male pride with this girl.
Maybe I got to dump her.
Then I'm thinking, no... maybe I ought to give her another chance.
Maybe I got to go for broke, maybe even ask her out.
- So?
- So what if she says no?
Eugene, when confronted with a risky proposition...
Doc, 10 words or less.
I'm on the clock.
Love is the leap that won't be denied.
I was going to say that. Good thinking.
I'll get her to dump the butcher.
I assume when you say "the butcher," you're speaking metaphorically.
No, I'm talking about the old fart I work for.
Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town
Gets full of corn
and starts bringin' 'em down
Just at the break of day
You can hear old Hannah say
Give me a pigfoot
and a bottle of beer
Send me, I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Bring the piano player a drink
Because he's bringin'me down
He's got a rhythm
Oh, yeah
When he stomps his feet
He sends me right off to sleep
Check all your razors and... 
So, Leo, what are you doing here?
I had to see you.
- I had to see you too.
- It's my wife.
- I know.
- She's looney tunes.
No, she's wonderful.
My wife?
- She's the one who got me singing.
- Marina?
So, the thing is...
The thing is...
You're grade "A," Stella, prime cut.
Together we're choice.
But my wife ain't got nobody but me... to see her through her time of trouble.
- We got to break it off, Leo.
- I can't just go abandoning her.
Are you women always one step ahead?
It's kind of spooky.
So... do you want this back?
Damn.
I just want to tell you
I'm real sorry for accusing you.
I just don't know what's the matter with me... and I hope you can forgive me.
I can.
I really loved the flowers.
And the window.
Really.
There was an art lady who came to the store today... and she really loved it too.
She said you should call her... and I think you should too...
'cause you've really got something special.
No, I don't.
No, a true gift.
I mean it.
He's such a good man, too, Doctor.
But I guess you were right, as usual.
If only his wife wasn't such a great lady.
But the thing is,
I know he loves me.
And I love him.
Such sweet sorrow.
God, love hurts!
Wait a second. You mean to tell me that Leo broke it off?
Maybe they're really not meant for each other.
Who?
Leo and Marina.
I never told you her name was Marina.
Of course you did.
No, I don't think so.
Sorry, then. My mistake.
No. That's her name.
I just... don't remember telling you that.
You two really love each other, right?
- Who?
- You and Leo, for God's sake.
- Gee, I think so.
- Yes or no? Stella, commit.
- Yes!
- Fine!
There. Now, if he's the right man for you... you can't let him slip by, can you?
Do you mind if I...
Can I?
But... he's married.
What about my addiction to failure in the form of married men?
Your addiction to failure stems from your failure to commit.
And your failure to commit stems from, of course... your lack of trust.
I'm a little confused.
You listen to me, Stella.
I am your psychiatrist.
You have got to commit to this affair once and for all... or you are doomed to fail.
And if you fail at this affair... you're gonna end up... a lonely, old spinster.
It's me, Stella.
I have to talk to you.
Hurry. Hurry.
Listen, Leo,
I'm no home-wrecker.
Well, actually, that's not true, but I don't want to wreck your home.
I like your wife too much.
But I love you.
Anyway, the thing is...
Dr. Tremor thinks that maybe we have a future together.
Who?
Dr. Tremor, my therapist.
Does it bother you that I'm in therapy?
Okay! All right!
Why, why, why are you fucking with my life?
I never laid a hand on her.
My life, my life!
First you start... by telling my wife to get me a girlfriend.
Then you tell my girlfriend... that we should have an affair.
Meanwhile my wife finds out about my girlfriend... only it's no go for her... because she didn't handpick her!
And now she's giving me looks with the meat cleaver!
What did I ever do to you?
It's a very confusing world, Leo.
I'd be lying to tell you otherwise.
What's the problem?
Ten words or less.
Jesus Christ! I'm trying to hold on to my marriage here.
Did it ever occur to you that your wife might want you to leave her?
Did it ever occur to you that your wife... might have found someone else?
My wife ain't having an affair.
- You never know.
- I know. I know.
You know why?
'Cause if she was...
I'd cut off his balls with a carving knife.
I apologize for the interruption.
Where were we?
What's on your mind, Doctor?
You can trust me.
I am having a professional breakdown.
I have done something... unforgivable.
Alex, you've got to stop thinking of yourself... as responsible for the fate of the world.
You're just a psychiatrist... trying to muddle through this twisted web of life.
You're obviously experiencing a stress-induced anxiety...
You know her too, don't you?
Know who?
The butcher's wife!
Okay, okay.
Goodness gracious.
I'm glad you're here.
I have so many things to tell you.
This has to stop now.
My practice is in chaos.
My patients are out of control because you are a psychiatrist's nightmare.
No. You don't understand.
I figured it all out...
I take chaos and turn it into order.
You take order and turn it into a chaos... that transcends chaos.
Why? I'll tell you why.
Because you are contagious.
That's why.
Everyone you touch just goes berserk.
You're the only one
I see jumping around... like a crazed jackrabbit.
Alex Tremor, you love me.
No! No, no, no!
Stop fighting it so hard.
Stop fighting it.
We're meant. It's destiny.
Why are you being so stubborn?
I am just a doctor.
All I've wanted to do since I was six years old is help people.
Me too.
- No. It's not the same.
- Oh, it is.
We both help people, just in our different ways.
Just when it comes to our true feelings and desires, we're just... too close to see clearly.
Marina... please, no more fairy tales, all right?
Can't you see how dangerous you are?
You say that listening to your heart and trusting what you feel... is that what you're calling dangerous?
You know what?
I hope I am contagious...
'cause life isn't about your damn books and theories.
You know what? Life is life.
And it's messy... and it's complicated and it takes guts.
That's not something you're gonna find in any book.
And just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's crazy.
No wonder everybody's wandering around lost on this island.
They can't even smell the tides.
Here we go again... the tides, the tides.
Can't you for once deal with the problem at hand... instead of hiding behind all this hoodoo voodoo...
Yes, I can. You know what?
You get out now.
Out of my way, asshole!
Just ignore him.
Honey, what are you doing?
I'm leaving.
- Where are you gonna go?
- Home.
I'm real sorry, Leo, for all the mess.
I really thought we were meant for each other.
Yeah.
Me too.
And you've been nothing but sweet to me.
I just wanted... so much to find somebody to love... and be loved by that...
I guess I just jumped into that boat so fast without thinking it through.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
Gracie, the sky is falling.
It's 2:00 in the morning, Alex.
Go home.
I know. I need to talk.
Yes, we do need to talk, Alex.
But you know what you need now?
You need sleep.
Yeah. Can I stay here tonight?
I don't want to be alone.
It's not a convenient time for me, Alex.
What? What?
I'm with somebody.
Gracie, that's... that's great.
- You may not think it's so great.
- Is everything all right, Gracie?
You've got Robyn in there.
I know that.
My career is a shambles... and my best friend is sleeping with my girlfriend.
Ain't love grand?
That's not gonna cut it.
We're happy.
Don't take it apart.
So...
I was the one who got her that nightgown.
- Call me tomorrow.
- Me too.
Gone is the romance
That was so divine
'Tis broken
And cannot be mended
You must go your way
And I must go mine
And now that our love dreams
Have ended
What'll I do
When you
Are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do
What'll I do
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you
What'll I do
What'll I do with just
A photograph
To tell my troubles to
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
Dreams that won't come true
What'll I do
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
Dreams that won't come true
What'll I do
What will
I do
Grammy d'Arbo.
Yes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I always wanted her to marry a doctor.
She's waiting on the lookout.
And I never read Plato.
Oh, it's a lonely world without your split-apart.
I've always had a hard time with mysteries... and I've never been very good with trust, but Marina...
I believe in you... and I love you.

Nevada prison officials
are scratching their heads this morning.
Over the disappearance of bank robber Julian Goddard, who escaped during last night's
electrical storm.
Goddard was serving time for his part.
In the daring
Silverado bank robbery.
Three years ago in Las Vegas.
Goddard's unidentified accomplice.
Was never apprehended.
Nor was the money ever recovered.
Sounds like it's going to be a busy day.
For cops and robbers alike.

I heard about you on the radio this morning.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. The news fellas was comparing you to Harry Houdini.
I kinda figured I'd see ya headed this way.
Yeah. You're probably not the only one.
Well, what do you think of the place?
It's all mine now.
You didn't buy it, did you?
Well, let's just say
I acquired it.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Thoreau.
I mean... I mean, it really...
It really looks like shit.
The universe is expanding, Julian.
It's beyond one man's power to stem the tide of chaos.

First off, Lucille hasn't exactly waited for you.
Well, she didn't leave town, did she?
No. She's still here, but she's Tuerto's girl now.

You said...
That, uh...
There were a couple problems.
Yes, I did.
Well, let me have it.
It's about the money, Julian.
Thoreau...
I spent three long years in prison.
Dreamin' about that money.
Whatever you do, don't tell me it's gone.
It's gone.
What do you mean... gone?
I mean... gone.
As in... away.
Do you wanna know what happened?
No. I wanna hit you again.
I... I didn't lose it.
I didn't squander it.
I was robbed!
It wasn't my fault.
Ooh.
You went back for Lucille.
Oh.
That's what screwed things up.
Can you hear me, Julian?
All right, for the sake of the rest of this conversation,
I'm just gonna assume you can hear me.
Now, you left me here.
In this god forsaken place...
With all that damn money.
I was a sitting duck.
Oh. You know, I figured...
I figured you could take care of yourself.
You know, I just don't get it, Thoreau.
I just don't get it.
I mean, you had a gun, a car.
You had your wits about you when I left ya.
You are seriously underestimating.
The power of the forces.
Which were aligned against us, Julian.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about.
The inescapable forces of fate.
I'm talking about fire and water!
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Don't tell me you gone and got god on me now.
Please don't tell me.
I'm not putting any names on him, but he was here, and he stole our money!
He?
Tell me there was more than one.
One was enough.
<font color="#ffff80">Thoreau:</font> If you recall, we had an appointment at Silverado bank, but, of course, you and Lucille.
Had to choose this particular moment in time.
To have a relationship talk.
You promised me that we would leave tonight.
You promised me.
We need some traveling money, don't we? Huh?
After tonight, we're gonna be on top of the world.
Then what?
And then... and then we'll leave.
This god forsaken town.
With the cops chasing us?
There ain't gonna be no cops.
Julian!
Thoreau and I got it figured out, baby.
It's gonna go like clockwork.
What if something goes wrong?
Nothing's gonna go wrong.
Julian, let's leave now.
Forget about the bank.
We don't need the money.
Let's get out of here before it's too late.
Don't... don't worry, baby.
You wait here, and I'll be back.
Before you can say Acapulco.
You have this power over me.
It is ripping me in half.
Part of me wants to stay, but the other part of me.
Wants to clear out of here right now.
Which part wants to stay?
<font color="#ffff80">Thoreau:</font> Now, we'd done more than our fair share of thievin',
but we never managed to get ahead.

What's up with you, Thoreau?
What the hell you still doing here after three years?
I'm waiting.
People left, this place fell to ruin, but I'm still here, and I'm waiting.
For what?
He's coming back.
That pool means something to him.
I hate to disappoint you,
Thoreau, but there ain't no way in hell this guy's coming back.
Whoever he is.
Well, you never know.
It's a town of limitless possibilities.
Why did you say that?
I don't know. It just popped into my head.
Why do you say anything?
Aw, it's... it's nothing.
Guy that dropped me off was driving a car just like yours.
Only his was '69.
Julian, mine was a '69.
Thoreau, yours was a '68.
It was mine. I owned it and I'm telling you it was a '69.
Aw, it's just a coincidence.
Like hell it is.
Plymouth only made 615
446 barrel coupes in 1969.
And 388 of those were four speeds.
Now you figure the odds on that.
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
He played me for a sucker once.
It ain't gonna happen twice.

You mean like the Manitou?
Exactly.
What's a manitou?
Sort of like a god, with a small "G."
<font color="#ffff80">Thoreau:</font>
Think of it this way, Julian.
Millions of people come to Las Vegas to gamble.
They pin their hopes and dreams.
On one spin of the wheel or roll of the dice.
It's a ritual, like a rain dance.
Or a circumcision.
And this repeated act of gambling has conjured a deity.
Uh-huh. And that's this guy Johnny?
Exactly. It's his job to dole out the luck.
And the beautiful part of it is it's all random.
Wait a second. Let's just go back to the beginning.
Why are you putting water in the pool?
He said if I help him, he'll give us our money back.
This pool's his path back to the spirit world.
Well, you see? You see?
Now everything makes perfect sense.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm glad to hear you say that, Julian.
To tell you the truth, I was...
I was kind of afraid you were gonna think I was off my nut.
That's exactly what
I think, you freak!
Did something happen to you while I was locked up?
Dropped on your head or something?
Somebody's making a fool out of you.
And doing a damn good job of it.
You used to be Harry Thoreau, the scourge of the west.
And now you're a freaking pool man.
Fuck you, Julian.
Yeah, well, fuck you too.
If he came around here while
I was here, I would've...
I would've thrashed him within an inch of his life.
And demanded some kind of restitution.
You wanna kick his ass so bad, tough guy, he's staying right down at the stardust.
What are you guys, pals or something?
<font color="#ffff80">Thoreau:</font>

Well, maybe I'll go pay him a visit.
And reach an understanding of my own.

That was before she met me.

She dumped him, hasn't seen him since.

You are giving me a fucking headache, Dravec!

We're gonna just take a quick look around.

I remember the first war.
The way the sky burned.
The faces of angels destroyed.
I saw a third of
Heaven's legion banished... and the creation of Hell.
I stood with my brothers and watched Lucifer fall.
But now my brothers are not brothers.
And we have come here, where we are mortal, to steal a dark soul not yet Lucifer's... to serve our cause.
I have always obeyed.
But I never thought the war... would happen again.
Come to our help,
Lord, Holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
You are the source of every honor and dignity, of all progress and stability.
You watch over the growing family of man by Your gift of wisdom... and Your pattern of order.
When You had appointed high priests to rule Your people,
You chose other men next to them in rank and dignity... to be with them and to help them in their task.
And so there grew up the ranks of priests... and the offices of Levites established by sacred rites.
In the desert You extended the spirit of Moses to 70 wise men... who helped him to rule the great company of his people.
He shared among the sons of Aaron the fullness of their father's power, to provide worthy priests in sufficient number... for the increasing rites of sacrifice and worship.
With the same loving care You gave companions to Your Son's apostles... to help in teaching the faith, they preached the Gospel to the whole world.
Let Joseph, who is to be ordained priest, come forward.
Lord, I am not worthy to receive You, but say the word and I shall be healed.
Almighty Father, grant to this servant of Yours the dignity of the priesthood.
Renew within him the spirit of holiness... as a coworker with the Order of Bishops.
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ.
One God, forever and ever.
Amen.
Let Thomas, who is to be ordained priest, come forward.
Some people lose their faith because Heaven shows them too little.
But how many people lose their faith because Heaven shows them too much?
Years later, of all the gospels
I learned in seminary school, a verse from St. Paul stays with me.
It is perhaps the strangest passage in the Bible, in which he writes:
"Even now in Heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons."
Hey, you're not supposed to be up here.
Sorry.
Don't fuckin' move.
You don't need a gun,
Thomas.
Who are you?
Everything used to be much simpler, didn't it?
Get down, slow.
- Everyone thinks they know what Heaven is like.
- Turn around. Turn around!
- Heaven isn't Heaven anymore.
- Now, take it easy.
- Calm down. Take it easy.
- Thomas... Thomas!
Will you listen?
I was in the church that day.
I know what you saw.
I know why you left your faith on that floor.
What do you want?
You have no idea what this is like for me.
"A Thesis on Angels in Religious Scripture"... by Thomas Dagget.
Do you still believe... any of it?
- You're asking me as a cop?
- As a priest.
But I'm not a priest.
St. Christopher.
"Go your way in safety."
Do you believe... that you're part of God's plan,
Thomas?
That's a complicated question.
No, it isn't.
You found it, haven't you?
You can't keep it from us, Simon!
Well, look at this. Tommy Dagget actually lit by the light of morning.
What am I doin' here, Burrows? I work nights. It's not even my division.
Well, we'll get to that.
Our friend here did a half-gainer from the fourth floor.
Jumper?
Not unless he decided not to bother opening the window first.
Was he fucked up or what?
Well, he wasn't exactly in condition to walk a chalk line when we got here.
You're welcome to smell his breath, if you like.
He is missing one or two things, though.
- What's that?
- His eyes.
Maybe they're stuck in the radiator grill.
Who's the room registered under?
- John Smith.
- Anything interesting inside?
Well, there are what an experienced detective like yourself... could possibly construe as signs of a struggle.
Of course, nobody saw or heard anything.
- Place been dusted?
- Yeah. Nothing.
Kinda weird, huh, somebody carrying that around?
That's why Lieutenant Deason had me call you down on this.
Any ideas what it's doin' here?
No.
"For it was there at Nicene...
"that the world's fourth-century bishops...
"declared that with the sacrifice of God's Son man became one with God,
"for the first time lifted above all other creations...
"to stand at His side in Heaven."
You been holdin' out on me.
I never knew you could read and write.
That measures eight feet.
Where's Chimney Rock?
Arizona.
It's where I'll be in two years and three months.
You gonna give all this up?
You're breakin' my heart.
Don't forget to tip the maid.
Hey, what's the big idea of sitting out here all alone?
Someone's here.
Where?
Pig out on all the cake?
No.
But there, there might be one teeny, tiny little piece left.
But you'll have to race me for it.
- What's that?
- Where?
Oh, you sneak!
Tommy. A little early for you, isn't it?
Joseph.
- They got you workin' days?
- Yeah.
Huh.
Tyson, slow down.
- Everybody's dead.
- Do you got any more of this?
No.
All right, where do you wanna start?
Well, I think we could skip the cause of death.
Why don't we begin with his eyes?
Your man has none.
What, they weren't in the radiator grill?
No, I mean, he never had any.
No optical fibers, no muscle pores, zip.
We did a toxicology on his blood, you know,
- looking for the usual: coke, booze, sugar.
- What'd you come up with?
High sodium, elevated erythrocytes, no floating cholesterol platelets, trace of ammonia.
- What's so unusual about that?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Actually, it's pretty common... for an aborted fetus.
- Fetus?
- We also did a bone section.
It wasn't much trouble; most of them were sticking out of his chest anyway.
Okay. And?
When a baby grows, their bones get larger... by having calcium layers form over the haversian canals. Are you with me?
- I'm with you.
- This leaves growth rings; everybody's got 'em.
Except our pal here.
Oh.
And this is for you.
He's also a hermaphrodite.
Ohh!
He's got both male and female sex organs.
- Think of the possibilities.
- Yeah.
He could be impotent and frigid at the same time. They don't normally work.
We found this in the lining of his coat.
- It's an old Bible.
- Yeah.
Handwritten.
Beautiful, really.
See this symbol?
Matches a scar on his neck.
Exactly the same.
That's attractive, huh?
Anything else?
There's a velvet book marker.
- Cute.
- What is it?
Twenty-third chapter of
St. John's Revelations.
And?
There is no 23rd chapter.
Well, maybe this is the teacher's edition.
- Can I keep this?
- Sign for it.
What are we gonna do here, Tommy?
Do me a favor... just sit on it for a couple of days, give me a head start... before the wolves start circling, OK?
Take your time.
"And there were angels who could not accept...
"the lifting of man above them,
"and, like Lucifer, rebelled against the armies of the loyal archangel Michael.
"And there rose a second war in Heaven."
"Lieutenant to the seraph or archangel Gabriel."
Gabriel.
Simon.
Mamacita.
Hey, cutie!
Hey, don't let the door hit you!
One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand, six-one thousand, seven-one thousand, eight-one thousand, nine-one thousand, ten-one thousand.
You guys, I know you're here.
You guys.
I know you're in here.
Hello there, young lady.
Hi.
I'm Simon.
What's your name?
- Mary.
- Mary!
Mary.
That's a pretty name.
- Does Miss Henley know you're here?
- No, she doesn't.
No one does.
And I would like to keep it like that, if we can.
Do you think that you could not tell anyone that I'm here, just for a little while?
Okay.
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!
- I have to go.
- Let's go!
Do you have to?
Are you hungry?
I could bring something.
That would be very nice, Mary.
Okay. Bye.
Gee, Jerry, you look like shit.
- Leave me alone, Gabriel.
- Soon, pal, soon.
- Come here.
- Go away.
Come here.
You still got a spark of life left in you.
- Fuck you.
- Hmm.
I want you to do something for me.
- Why don't you just let me die?
- Soon.
Honest.
Don't start.
You know how I hate that.
I'm so tired.
I'm so goddamn tired.
Watch the profanity.
One more favor.
- What?
- I want you to get something for me.
Some personal effects the cops took from the Gable Apartments... on Seventh Street.
It'll be sitting in a property room on San Julian.
And you just want me to waltz right in there like this, right?
Go in during a shift change.
- You got the name the stuff is under?
- John Doe.
- Oh. Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Number 12.
Bus fare.
7-8-25, code six.
105 North Vann, route 52.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Final spectrometry came back on that fancy Bible of yours.
If that new chapter's a forgery, it's an old one.
Carbon dating checks out second century.
That would make this Bible the oldest in existence then.
So don't lose it.
How's the translation going?
Well, from what I can make out so far, this thing seems to be mostly about angels and the second war in Heaven.
A second angel war?
Over what?
Us. Humans.
It says when God gave us a soul some angels became jealous... and they started this war.
Really? You translated all of that?
Well, when did it end?
It doesn't say it did.
It does prophesy a little, though.
Come on.
Let me show you something.
It's been a while here, so bear with me.
"And there shall be a dark soul,
"and this soul will eat other dark souls and so become their inheritor.
"This soul will not rest in an angel but a man, and he shall be a warrior."
Nice.
Very nice.
Let me ask you something.
Why wouldn't God just get rid of the bad angels?
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe He can't.
- Maybe He won't.
- Come on.
Don't be so serious.
It's not like all this is real.
Well, what's in the basement is real.
And according to this, it's got a name.
Remember that symbol on his neck?
According to some ancient
Hebrew cabalists, that's angelic script for an angel named Uziel.
Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice?
- I'm gonna need to see a pass.
- Shh.
- Yeah.
- Stop it.
- Dork!
- It's over. Back to the real world of learning.
Wait up.
Brian, have you seen Mary?
- I think she's out back.
- Allison?
We haven't seen her since lunch.
Were you upstairs?
Mm-hmm. All right.
Until I get back
I want everyone reading... and being quiet.
Mary?
Mary?
- Mary, come here.
- But Simon and I were...
Now.
Ohh.
I'm not mad at you. I just want you to go back to class. Okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
This is school property.
You can't sleep here.
It wasn't part of the plan.
Are you all right?
Not really.
I'll have to call the police.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
They can help you.
No.
Not me.
Please leave, Katherine.
Hi.
Well, now.
I thought you left.
I hid.
I'm very clever.
Oh, yes, you are.
Very clever.
Mary,
I have very little time left.
And since you have been so nice to me, there's something that I would very much like to give to you.
What?
Something very special.
Can you keep a secret?
The biggest secret ever?
What is it?
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay. Come here.
You're a very clever girl.
Close your eyes.
Mary?
Oh, honey.
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel good.
Did you...
Did you eat something?
- Can I go home now?
- Come on.
It's okay.
Emma?
Mary got really sick in school and I thought she should come home.
I don't feel very good, Grandma.
Come on, sweetie.
It's all right.
I'll have the school send for a doctor.
He was just lying up there.
Most of my deputies are at a tanker spill right now and they may be a while.
These people are rarely any problem.
I'll have one of the boys come down by tonight or tomorrow and shoo him out for ya.
All right. I mean, as, as, as soon as you can.
He was kind of strange.
All right, thanks.
Looks like one of those snow angels we used to make as kids, you know.
Lay down on a clean snowbank, swing your arms up and down.
You know what this means, don't you?
Our friend's cleaned out all our evidence on Mr. Doe here, everything.
Yeah.
- Guard get a good look at who nailed him?
- Yeah.
Tall.
Smiled a lot.
I think I have to go.
- Where?
- Chimney Rock.
Go.
Figure this out.
Then call.
Tell me I'm not crazy.
You like the desert,
Jerry?
You promised.
Soon! Don't be a pest about it.
Never trust a fucking angel.
I can't see, you know.
Hey, look, man, what the hell do you need me for, huh?
It's a big universe, Jerry.
Some things in it are talking monkey work.
Monkeys. Like you.
Oh. Well, that's great, Gabe.
Stop!
Stop the car!
Ahh.
I can always smell a graveyard.
# I went to sleep #
You enjoyin' yourself up there?
I always enjoy watching you work, Jerry.
How'd I ever get you in my life?
- Stop. You didn't really want to kill yourself.
- Oh, no, I did, actually.
I did kill myself, right?
- I mean, I did do it.
- Ahh, technically.
- So you're just keeping me alive.
- Letting you die slower.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, man. I'm so in your debt.
Thank you, Jerry.
I'm touched.
Ohh! Fuck.
- Ah.
- Oh, fuck.
Don't hurt it.
Ah. There you go.
That's it.
Brush off. That's it.
Be very careful.
Open it up.
Whoa.
Ah, there it is.
Not much to look at.
It's not what's on the outside that matters.
It's what's on the inside.
Oooh!
You are looking at the cleverest, meanest, sickest talking monkey.
I love him.
Time to go.
Gimme a kiss.
It's not here.
- More bad news for the war effort, huh?
- Shut up!
Jerry, come here.
If you were a soul, where would you hide?
The hell away from you.
- Hi, Simon.
- Hi, Gabriel.
Long time.
You know why I'm here.
Oh, yes.
You don't have it on you, by chance.
- No.
- No.
That'd be too easy.
Sorry, man.
You know.
Simon.
Get serious.
So, where's the soul?
You know, bigger than a bread box; used to occupy the recently dead
Colonel Hawthorne.
You can't keep it from me, Simon.
The stalemate is over.
Why are you doing this, Gabriel?
I want what's mine.
I bow to no human in Heaven.
- But the Word...
- No one hears the Word anymore. No one!
- Without the Word...
- There's only the argument. I'll not step aside.
I will not allow any talking monkey... to take my place.
I'll burn down Heaven to stop it.
I'm so tired of this war.
Reject the lie, Simon.
Join us.
Help us make it like it was before the monkeys.
You remember?
We cast out Lucifer's army.
You and I.
We threw their rebel thrones from the wall.
- They wanted to be gods.
- I don't want to be a god, Simon.
I just want to make it like it was before the lie, when He loved us best.
Oh, Gabriel.
When was it that you lost your grace?
I'd like to help you, old friend, but I can't.
I'm not sure who's right, who's wrong, but it doesn't matter.
Sometimes you just have to do what you're told.
That's who we are.
You know, the great thing... about a conversation like this?
You never have to have it again.
You know the routine.
Yes.
Not yet!
Simon.
I can make this last forever.
This is getting boring, Simon.
Hey, man...
Where is it? Where did you put it?
Give it to me!
You're an abomination, Gabriel.
You'll never get that soul.
You're a tough one, friend.
Old school.
What's going on, John?
You may want to skip this one, Katherine.
Were any of your, uh, students up here?
Mary.
- How is she?
- Same.
- Has she seen the doctor yet?
- He found nothing.
But something is in her.
So we have called the hand trembler to find if she must have a sing.
"And there shall be a dark soul,
"and this soul will eat other dark souls and so become their inheritor.
"This soul will not rest in an angel, but a man,
"and he shall be a warrior."
How long ago was he buried?
- Which time?
- "Which time"? What do you mean?
Somebody dug him up last night.
Local hoods, probably.
I just finished puttin' him back.
- Did you call the sheriff?
- Sure.
They were busy up at the school this morning. Some wino burned himself up.
I expect I'll be buryin' him too.
Don't run!
Don't run.
Can I help you with something?
Yes, I'm Thomas Dagget with the police.
- Katherine Henley.
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- It's about that guy upstairs?
- That's right.
Well, sorry, but I kinda got my hands full right now.
Do you mind if I tag along?
- Here, let me help you with that.
- Make yourself useful.
- Hey, you forgot something!
- Thanks.
- What grade is this?
- Oh, it's all of them.
The town doesn't seem that small.
Well, after the copper mine closed, it sort of took most of the town with it.
Jade, you hurry back!
So we just teach out of this one corner now.
The rest of the school has been abandoned for years.
It's happened before, you know.
Homeless people just looking for a place to sleep.
Of course, no one's ever burned themselves up before.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah. I wanted to know what he was doing there.
- Did he say?
- No, he didn't say.
I mean, he looked like he was hurt.
Bloody, like somebody had cut him.
Is there something going on
I should know about?
Did any of the children come in contact with him, talk to him in any way?
- Yes.
- Which one?
Well, she's home, sick today.
I'd like to speak with her parents, if that's possible.
Well, her parents are dead.
She lives with her grandmother.
I'd have to ask her.
Did you know an Arnold Hawthorne?
The colonel.
Did you go to his funeral?
Everybody did. He lived here.
Any dark secrets?
There are no secrets in a small town,
Mr. Dagget, dark or otherwise.
Okay. Thank you.
Sure.
No, not really.
I mean, he lived here but...
- nobody ever really talked to him much.
- Have any family?
Nah, not Hawthorne. Town'll probably just auction this place.
- Yeah.
- Well, lock up when you're done.
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure.
It's unusual... to see someone your age in a church on a weeknight.
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's a sign of excellent character. You're not from here.
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for something.
- Did you find it?
- I will.
I found what you're looking for... Thomas.
Excuse me? Do I know you?
How do you know my name?
Ah, you look like a Thomas.
Hey. Look at me.
You want me to look at you? Huh?
You know how you got that dent in your top lip?
Way back, before you were born,
I told you a secret, then
I put my finger there... and I said,
"Shh."
Okay?
There and there.
Put your lips there.
Pucker your lips and blow.
Just a little bit.
This trumpet's special.
Very good.
Kevin.
Have a mint.
On me. Huh?
Oooh-ohhh.
What? What, you want an autograph?
Come on, get out of here.
Next.
- Sandra.
- How'd you know my name?
Well, you look like a Sandra.
You have very pretty teeth, Sandra.
- Thank you.
- Let's check 'em. Hmm? Ahh.
- Did you see the man upstairs, Sandra?
- A little.
- Did you talk to him?
- No.
Well, who did, Sandra?
Who talked to the man?
Mary.
- Where is Mary, Sandra?
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I'm talkin' to the kids, ma'am.
- Sandra, come here.
Come here, honey.
The rest of you inside. Now. Go on.
- Bye, Gabriel.
- See you, kids. Study your math.
Key to the universe.
Bye, Gabriel.
- Who are you?
- That's a long story.
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, everybody else does.
Look, I don't know what's going on here, but I think you both should leave.
You're right.
You have no idea what's going on.
So you saw Simon.
What did he say to you?
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Why? Is something wrong?
Emma.
It's okay, Mary.
You don't have to talk to him.
You don't have to talk to any of them.
He was just asking me about Simon.
Simon?
What did he say to you, Mary?
- He asked if I could keep a secret.
- What was that?
Something he gave me.
- What did he give you?
- Then it wouldn't be a secret.
You're a good friend not to tell, Mary.
But I'm a good friend of Simon's too.
So if you want to go ahead and say what it was, you can to me, okay?
It's a secret.
But sometimes it hurts.
Ever cut off a Chinaman's head?
They don't bleed.
Not like we do.
Or maybe it was just the cold.
You could always tell when they were coming.
Those songs.
They charge through the snow.
Their guns froze.
And that was okay because we were better.
Colder.
At Chosin, we were colder than anyone.
Make it stop, Miss Henley!
Make it stop!
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Make it stop! Make it stop!
Shh.
What are we gonna do?
She's going to have the enemy ghost way.
We leave this afternoon.
- Wh... Where's the ceremony?
- It's at her clan's village. Old Woman Butte.
You're gonna take her away?
This girl needs a doctor.
She's already seen a doctor.
Chinamen's heads? Chosin? I've never heard her talk that way before.
Is someone teaching that to your kids in class?
Yeah, sure.
Right next to Jack and Jill.
Colonel Hawthorne was at Chosin.
Did she talk to him?
She had no contact with him.
He hated children.
This isn't just about some drunk... who burned himself up at the school, is it?
Can you tell me the truth, Thomas?
Did you ever read the Bible, Katherine?
Long time ago.
Did you ever notice how in the Bible, whenever God needed to punish someone... or make an example, or whenever God needed a killing,
He sent an angel?
Did you ever wonder what a creature like that must be like?
A whole existence spent praising your God, but always with one wing dipped in blood.
Would you ever really want to see an angel?
Why are you asking me this?
They want Colonel Hawthorne.
They want a dead, forgotten, psychotic colonel.
They?
There was a man at my school this morning.
The children were calling him Gabriel.
He had Sandra on his lap.
What does he want with my kids?
I don't know, Katherine.
But I gotta find him.
I know where you can find him.
He was parked right here.
It's cold.
What's that?
I don't know.
It's angelic script.
Thomas?
No!
Saint John was right.
There's a war in Heaven.
Is Gabriel an angel?
He wants something.
Something that's here.
He wants Mary.
Thomas, he wants Mary.
Mary?
His car.
Get away from her.
Son of a gun. Priest.
Wanna-be. Figured it out.
- Mary?
- Shh.
She won't feel anything, honest.
I have to rip her apart, of course.
Just the way it goes. See, Simon hid
Hawthorne's soul inside her. I need it.
Nice Catholic boy like you, Mr. Dagget, you should be on my side.
Goddamn it!
You're gonna have to watch it with that profanity.
Mary.
Look in my eyes.
Come on, motherfucker!
Come on, fuck!
Thanks, man.
You're a sport.
Pest! Do you have any idea how hard it is to get one of those?
Why?
I'm an angel. I kill firstborns while their mamas watch.
I turn cities into salt.
I even, when I feel like it, rip the souls from little girls.
And from now till kingdom come, the only thing you can count on, in your existence, is never understanding why.
You, give me a kiss.
- Mary!
- Go! Go!
You... can't... have her!
Thomas!
- You don't understand. You gotta cuff him.
- He's dead.
He's not dead. You gotta cuff him, do you hear me?
- Bob, just do it.
- Do it!
All right, Jack. Cuff him.
Put him in my car.
- All right.
- They got him. They got him.
- Wh... Where's Mary?
- She's here. She's here.
Hey.
On Earth, they're not immortal.
They're not like you and me.
You've got to cut their hearts out.
Come on.
We gotta go.
Let's go. Let's go.
This is a good place.
Separate water source.
Stocked grain.
Only one possible approach.
A man could, with the proper defenses, hold off an entire battalion.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Yeah, someone's gonna die. Soon. Here.
I'll just be a minute.
Uh, there's no visitors allowed in I.C.U.
Timing is so important.
I smell these things.
Shh.
So.
"Nancy."
Recovering? Hmm.
Recovering? Huh.
Stable?
Get out of here.
Deteriorating.
Critical.
My favorite.
Rachael.
Not yet. Come back.
Come on back. Get up.
That's it. Come on back.
Ooh. Ahh.
- Hi!
- No, no, no, no, no.
Shh.
Don't start.
I hate that.
Come on, don't start.
It's only for a short time.
Promise.
Hello, Katherine.
We must talk.
- Oh, my God.
- God?
God is love.
I don't love you.
I... I can't.
I can't do this.
I can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mother's feces.
Or we can talk.
- Are you one of them?
- Them?
Are you an angel?
I am the first angel, loved once above all others.
A perfect love.
# But like all true love #
# One day it withered on the vine #
Ahh, the winged party boy is about.
Come to feed on the guts of your little Mary.
- Are you a part of it?
- No, Katherine.
Other angels have made this war because they hate you.
You and all humans.
God has put you in His grace and pushed them aside.
They're desperate. They've never been able to conquer the other loyal angels.
And so this war has remained in stalemate for thousands of years.
And while this state of affairs endures, no soul can meet its God.
Your parents and their parents and so on, from the beginning, lie still in wormy earth.
Of course, some of them do come to me eventually.
For while Heaven may be closed,
I am always open, even on Christmas.
Gabriel has a plan.
Humans... and how I love you talking monkeys for this... know more about war and treachery of the spirit... than any angel.
Gabriel is well aware of this... and has found a way to steal the blackest soul on Earth to fight for him.
If he wins, Heaven opens.
I know that this new Heaven will just be another Hell.
You see, I'm not here to help you and the little bitch... because I love you or because I care for you, but because two hells is one hell too many... and I can't have that.
What I'm offering you is a chance not only to save Mary, but to finally open Heaven to your kind.
What do you say?
I saw the devil tonight.
If you have something to say, why can't you say it to me?
Thomas.
I had a voice once, Katherine.
For as long as I could remember,
I had a voice... that called me to my God, that called me to church.
And on the day that I needed that voice the most, it left me.
It's better never having known that voice.
All I know is that I'm not going to let anything happen to Mary.
All right?
Say, ma'am, any idea where I can find
Old Woman Butte?
Yeah, it's on the reservation.
Don't suppose you could be just a tad more specific,
Madge?
The light.
It was so... br... bright.
- Isn't your friend hungry?
- What?
Not for a while, I'm afraid.
Funniest thing.
Don't do that.
- Take the 522 to the Sonsela Wash cutoff.
- Right.
First dirt road, go left 20, 25 miles.
You'll see it.
Much obliged.
Let's get crackin', Rachael.
No.
Eternity here.
In that sagging skin suit.
Or one more day with me.
Why?
Can't drive.
But I can wait.
Until the stars burn out, if you don't make up your mind.
I doubt we'll meet again.
- Suits me.
- Thank Heaven.
Little Tommy Dagget.
How I loved listening to your sweet prayers every night.
And then you'd jump in your bed, so afraid I was under there.
And I was.
Do you know what hell really is, Thomas?
It's not lakes of burning oil or chains of ice.
It's being removed from God's sight, having His Word taken from you.
It's hard to believe. So hard.
I know that better than anyone.
And there's your weapon.
Think, Thomas, think.
What is the one thing essential to an angel, the thing that holds his entire being together?
Faith.
Faith, faith.
And what would happen if that faith was tested, and an angel just like you... didn't understand?
Use that.
Use it!
He's coming.
Go inside, lock the door.
There's one shot.
Okay?
It'll be okay.
You're gonna love it, Rachael.
It'll be our night to howl.
Nice move.
Beautifully done.
Tommy, you've got to come work for me.
Upstairs.
I... I could get you in now.
You'll love it.
Nobody tells you when to go to bed.
You eat all the ice cream you want.
You get to kill... all day, all night, just like an angel!
Save yourself, friend!
Why go to the wall for that bitch and her rug rat?
It all turns out the same anyway. Now, later.
I'm gonna rip that kid apart.
I'm not an angel!
I'm just a man.
Which means I've got something you don't. It's a soul.
This is gonna really hurt.
Your war...
Make it good.
- Your war is a lie!
- Right.
It's not about humans.
It's about God.
What do you know about that, you monkey?
I don't have to, Gabriel.
I know you.
I know what it's like to be ignored, pushed aside.
I know your anger. I know what it's like to lose your faith in the Word.
I know.
'Cause you hate Him.
You hate Him just a little bit.
'Cause you're jealous.
That's what this war's about... jealousy.
Jealousy that He could love something more than you.
Something with a soul.
Well.
If you wanted to prove your side was right, Gabriel, so badly, why didn't you just ask Him?
Why didn't you just ask God?
Because...
He doesn't talk to me anymore.
Gabriel!
- I'm getting so fed up with you.
- Go to hell.
Heaven, darling, Heaven.
At least get the zip code right.
It's all the same to you, isn't it?
No. In Heaven, we believe in love.
- What do you love, Gabriel?
- Cracking your skull.
Kill me!
Oh, God!
Mary!
Go home.
Go home!
Finish it.
Long time.
This war is mine.
Your war is arrogance.
That makes it evil.
That's mine.
Lucifer, sitting in your basement, sulking over your breakup with the boss.
You're nothing.
Time to come home, Gabriel.
The enemy ghost is gone.
The war's over.
It's done.
No. I want you both to come home with me.
- Never.
- "I love you. I love you more than Jesus."
You owe me one.
- You're gonna ask me to take you home.
- No.
You will. Because anything else will be worse than you could ever imagine.
Katherine.
I have my soul.
And I have my faith.
What do you have... angel?
Leave the light on, Thomas.
Is he coming back?
I don't think so.
And in the end I think it must be about faith.
And if faith is a choice, then it can be lost... for a man, an angel... or the devil himself.
And if faith means never completely understanding God's plan, then maybe understanding just a part of it, our part, is what it is to have a soul.
And maybe, in the end, that's what being human is, after all.
A very long time ago...
...there lived a beautiful princess, in a mystical land known as...
...India.
She was married to the handsome Prince Rama...
...who had been banished to the enchanted forest...
...by his jealous stepmother,
Queen Kaikeyi.
One day...
...Princess Sita saw a wounded deer in the woods...
...and she begged Rama to go and help it.
Rama drew a circle in the ground and said to her:
''This is a magic circle.
So long as you stay inside it...
...no harm can come to you. ''
That night, the princess heard a horrible cry.
Help me.
Thinking it was her beloved Rama in danger...
...the princess ran from the circle to answer the cry.
She soon came across an old beggar man.
Although she had no money to give him...
...she could not refuse his plea.
As soon as he had the bracelet...
...he transformed into the
1 0-headed demon, Ravana.
He grabs her and takes her to his palace...
...to make her his bride.
Did you ever know a real prince, Maya?
Laki's father.
- I thought he was in the army.
- He was.
And he was my prince.
And I, his princess.
But I mean real princes and princesses.
All women are princesses.
It is our right.
I shall miss it here.
India is the only place on earth that stirs the imagination.
I wish we could stay here forever.
I know, sweetheart.
But now that England's at war...
...I must go too.
You understand, don't you?
But why must I go to America?
Because it's safer.
And you'll be going to the school your mother went to at your age...
- ...in a city called?
- New York.
Papa?
Maya told me that all girls are princesses.
- Maya is a very wise woman.
- Then it's true?
You can be anything you want to be, as long as you believe.
- What do you believe?
- I believe that you are...
...and always will be, my little princess.
I gave this to your mother on our wedding day.
I want you to have it.
She was so beautiful.
What did you love most about her?
Tough question.
I loved the way her eyes lit up when she laughed.
Just like yours do.
I loved the sound of her voice when she sang me the Indian folksong.
But I think, more than anything else...
...I loved dancing with her!
Hello!
You must be Captain Crewe.
My sister will be down presently.
We were just preparing the young lady's room.
Your things arrived this morning.
Thank you...?
Heavens, Amelia.
Amelia Minchin.
Captain Crewe.
How delightful to meet you!
And this must be little Sara.
My, what a beautiful child.
- I was telling the Captain--
- Thank you, that'll be all.
Won't you follow me?
Classes begin promptly at 8:00.
We cover all subjects: literature, math, science...
...and of course, French and Latin.
Oh, Sara speaks fluent--
Luncheon is served at 1 :30.
Then we take our daily walk...
...unless the weather is extremely inclement.
At 4:00, the girls attend etiquette classes...
...where they're trained in the formal graces of society.
Study hall is between 4:30 and 6:30, followed by a light supper.
Before bedtime, we read from one of the classics...
...something the children look forward to with anticipation.
Sunday is a day of rest.
Students may write to their parents.
And of course, we attend church.
Have you any questions?
Come along, dear.
Girls.
Say hello to our new arrival...
...Miss Sara Crewe.
Hello, Sara.
You must tell them about your exciting life in India.
No doubt she'll be our most popular student in no time.
There are certain rules that should be made clear.
First is the Order Rule...
...which requires the girls keep their rooms spotless.
These rules are strictly enforced.
But I assure you, the results are well worth the effort.
Our reputation for sending the most poised...
...and charming young ladies into society...
...is one of the highest.
I've no doubt.
Also, I'm afraid jewelry and such finery are not allowed.
What if I wear it in my room, during my free time?
If you absolutely insist.
I do.
She'll get in trouble.
This is splendid.
It's our largest suite.
Thank you for all the care you've taken.
I want Sara to feel at home while I'm away.
- No expense shall be spared.
- Of course not.
I'll let you say goodbye.
You don't have much time before your boat leaves.
We'll write to each other every day.
How do you like your room?
I made sure it was the best, with corner windows and a fireplace.
And with all your toys and clothes moved in...
...it's as if you were really...
I think I saw something...
...on that chair over there.
She came all the way from France to be with you.
Her name is Emily.
Dolls make the very best friends.
Just because they can't speak doesn't mean they don't listen.
Did you know, when we leave them alone in our room, they come to life?
- They do?
- Yes.
Before we walk in, they quickly return to their places.
Why don't they come to life in front of us?
Because it's magic.
Magic has to be believed.
That's the only way it's real.
Whenever you're afraid, or miss me terribly...
...just tell Emily.
She'll get the message to me, wherever I am.
And I'll send one back right away...
...so when you hug her...
...you'll be getting a hug from me.
It's all right, Papa.
I'm going to be fine.
What are you doing?
Memorizing me by heart?
I already know you by heart.
Goodbye princess.
What was that noise last night?
Somebody was crying for hours.
That's nothing.
You should hear Josephine snore.
I do not!
Who was it? The new girl?
She hasn't come out of her room.
Did you see all her toys?
I want your hair ribbon.
Her father grows crackers.
They're very rich.
They must be.
Everyone I know eats crackers.
Her father's British. I hear he's best friends with the king and queen.
I hear he was thrown out of India...
...because people died from eating his poisoned crackers.
Poisoned crackers?
My aunt died from eating poisoned string beans.
- Who cares about her?
- Yeah, who cares?
But before we catch them, they return to their places, quick as lightning.
Gosh, she's fast.
Mama.
Sara?
We don't delay breakfast for one student.
I'm sorry, but I--
Remember, you're not the only child here.
Yes, good morning.
You remember our newest pupil from our visit yesterday.
This is Monsieur Dufarge.
You begin French lessons today.
Do I have to?
You most certainly do.
Apologize to Monsieur for your rudeness.
- But I didn't mean to be rude.
- Now!
This child doesn't need to learn French.
She practically is French!
She learned from her father.
I understood what she said.
I'm sorry. We tried to tell you.
She can tutor the younger children...
...and help you with your pronunciation, Miss Minchin.
Are those sausages I smell?
Thank you.
There's no talking at the table.
Doesn't seem natural.
I won't say it again.
Seven times five is 35.
Seven times six is 42.
Seven times seven is 49.
Seven times eight is...
No, wait. 54?
Or 72? Or 93? Or 1 2?
I'm sorry, Miss Minchin.
I studied for hours last night.
I find that hard to believe.
I imagine your father will as well.
Please don't tell him.
I promise I'll do better.
Please.
Lavinia, you may continue.
Seven times eight is 56.
Seven times nine...
...is 63.
Dear Papa:
I miss you already.
Things are fine.
Except I never imagined there would be so many rules at school.
I guess they're there for a purpose...
...and I'm trying hard to obey them.
But I get the feeling
I'm doing something wrong.
Goodbye, Father.
Bye, son.
I hope when you read this...
...it kindles your heart and puts a smile on your face.
I'm so proud of you.
I think about you every moment.
And I love you forever.
Your Sara.
Lottie, you mustn't get so excited.
Lottie? Precious?
Please, Lottie dear!
Please stop screaming!
How about a cookie?
Would you like that?
I'll get a cookie.
It's hard to study with you carrying on like this.
I want my mama!
You'll see her soon.
I won't. She's dead, and I won't ever see her again!
I don't have a mother either.
You don't?
Where is she?
In heaven with my baby sister.
That doesn't mean
I can't talk to her.
I tell her everything, and I know she hears me.
How?
Because that's what angels do.
- Your mama's an angel?
- Of course.
And so is yours.
With beautiful wings of silk...
...and a crown of rosebuds.
And they all live together in a castle.
Do you know what it's made of?
Sunflowers...
...hundreds of them, so bright they shine like gold.
When the angels want to go someplace...
...they just whistle, like this.
And a cloud floats to the castle and picks them up.
As the angels fly through the sky...
...riding the cloud like a magic carpet...
...under the moon and through the stars...
...until they're hovering above us.
That's how they can look down and see if we're all right.
And sometimes they even send messages to us.
You can't hear them if you're kicking and screaming as you were.
But they always try again, in case we've missed it.
Hey, wait!
That's Becky.
She's not allowed to talk to us.
Why not?
She's a servant girl, and she has dark skin.
So?
Well, doesn't that mean something?
I'm sorry, I--
Is there anything
I can do for you, miss?
I just came up here to change my shoes.
No, there's nothing.
Begging your pardon, but we'll both be in trouble if you stay.
All right, girls, pair up.
Pair up.
''Sir Edward saw the sorrow in his daughter's eyes...
...but he knew that family honor must prevail.
Nobility was not to be trifled with.
'I beg of you, Charlotte,' he said.
'Marry Sir John in the spring, as he has asked.' ''
Thank you, Lavinia.
Sara, you may take your turn.
''Charlotte said to her father,
'Father, you are right.
I must put away my foolish fancies and childhood wishes.' ''
But I simply won't do it.
I'm sorry, Father.
When I marry, it'll be for love.
And with that,
Charlotte ran from the house.
Waiting outside was the handsome stable boy, Pierre...
...whom Charlotte secretly adored.
Together they escaped to the coast and quickly set sail for Tahiti.
When they were halfway there, their ship was attacked by pirates!
Rather than be eaten alive...
...they threw themselves into the sea.
As they began to drown...
...they held each other close, and swore undying love.
Then, when all seemed lost, a group of mermaids appeared--
Stop!
What are you doing?
I couldn't bear to see her marry him, so I imagined another ending. lmagined it?
Don't you ever do that, miss?
Believe in something, just to make it seem real?
That's easy for a child who has everything.
There will be no more make-believe at this school...
...during reading or any other time.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Miss Minchin.
All of you, go to your bed.
I never heard a story like that in my life.
I bet you know lots of them, don't you, Sara?
I want silence up there!
We have to do something about this communication rule.
After Minchin goes to bed...
...we'll sneak into your room, and you can show us a real story.
How about it, Sara?
Only if it's just you three.
Come on, come on.
The evil Ravana locked the princess up in his tower.
There she stayed for many weeks...
...just staring out her window...
...missing her Prince Rama terribly.
Perfect.
You look just like Emily.
My father hates dolls.
And he hates coming here.
Says he doesn't belong.
Then why does he send you?
Because he wants me to belong.
My little girl. She spoke French!
She really spoke French.
Your mother and I are very proud of you.
I caught you, Nellie!
Papa!
Randolph...John!
Rama approached the thorny palace...
...unaware that Ravana was waiting for him.
That's it!
I can't take it anymore!
I don't care what you say about Sara's stories.
They have to be more fun than watching your hair being combed!
If anyone else feels the same way, she should leave too.
But Ravana was not through yet.
He took a bow that could hold, not one, but 1 0 arrows...
...each filled with poison.
The arrows sped through the air...
...heading straight for Rama.
The arrows hit the ground...
...and released their poison, giant clouds of thick, yello w smoke.
- I want a big piece!
- Hush up, Lottie.
''Princess'' Sara will give everyone a fair share.
Right, Princess?
I told her that's what you were.
Well, not just me.
All girls are princesses.
Even snotty, two-faced bullies like you, Lavinia.
Here, Lavinia, you get a big piece.
Yes, may I help you?
I'm Mr. Barrow.
Captain Crewe's solicitor.
Oh, yes, do come in.
- We're celebrating Sara's birthday.
- May I speak to you in private?
Yes, of course.
Right this way.
May I just say that Sara is quite the favorite around here.
We went to great lengths to make this a special day for her.
I'm afraid your check to us this month will be rather large.
There will be no check,
Miss Minchin.
Excuse me?
The party is over! Everyone go to their rooms, this instant!
But we--
Sara, you will stay behind.
I have something to tell you.
Move!
Amelia, go to Sara's room and find a simple black dress.
If nothing is suitable, borrow one.
- But, sister--
- Do as I say.
Why would I need a black dress,
Miss Minchin?
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Sara.
Your father has...
Your father--
It's been discovered that your father has died.
He was killed in battle several weeks ago.
I'm sorry.
That's the situation, and there's nothing we can do to change it.
The British government has seized control of his company and assets...
...leaving you penniless, without any money.
Since you've no relations, this puts me in a terrible position.
What are you staring at?
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
You are alone in the world...
...unless I decide to keep you here...
...out of charity.
Because of the expenses you've incurred, all you own is mine...
...your clothes, your toys, everything.
It'll hardly make up for the financial losses I've suffered.
From now on, you must earn your room and board.
You'll move to the attic and work as a servant.
If you fail to meet our standards...
...or if you don 't obey, you'll be thrown out.
And the streets of this city are not kind to homeless beggars.
Report to Mabel in the kitchen promptly at 5 a.m.
You could be arrested for taking this.
You're lucky I let you keep that doll.
You may have the book.
But another incident like this...
...and I will call the authorities.
I expect you to remember,
Sara Crewe...
...you're not a princess any longer.
Papa.
Papa, please.
Sara, what happened?
You're to serve the girls without conversation, understand?
Sara will be working here as a servant from now on.
There will be no communication.
Is that clear?
Yes, Miss Minchin.
Seven times five is 35.
Seven times six is 42.
Let go!
Great God!
It can't be!
It's my son, John!
Dear God, no.
Not John.
It's John, Ram Dass!
It's John. Help me.
- Come inside.
- Help.
I thought you'd be sleeping.
I never got a chance to give you your birthday present.
It's a picture of where you used to live.
See the blue threads?
That's the river.
These are the mountains you always talk about.
Thank you, Becky.
It's beautiful.
Why don't you tell stories anymore?
They're just make-believe.
They don't mean anything.
They've always meant something to me.
Some days I thought I'd die, until
I heard you talk about the magic.
There is no magic, Becky.
Papa...
...can you hear me?
I'm so scared.
Are you still a princess?
You better get back in line or we'll both be in trouble.
Are you?
Girls, get in line.
Don't touch that!
It's for Mr. Randolph.
The poor man. His son is missing in action in Europe.
You mean John?
He's such a nice boy.
Here, little girl.
I told you not to give your money away.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
You see?
You never get rid of them.
May I help you?
Would you like to buy a flower?
Would you like to buy a flower?
- Would you?
- Not today.
Would you like to buy a flower?
Would you?
Pardon me.
Give her a flower.
Wait!
For the princess.
What is it, little mouse?
Are you a prisoner too?
Is it ever this cold where you come from?
No.
Tell me about it, Sara.
Tell me again about India.
India.
Tell me.
Well...
...the air is so hot there...
...you can almost taste it.
I bet it tastes like coconuts.
It's more like spices, really.
Curry and saffron.
What else?
Tigers sleep under trees...
...and elephants cool themselves in the lakes.
The warm wind blows through the fields...
...and the spirits ride it...
...singing as they look down on us.
Their voices echo through the mountains...
...and the sky...
...is all different colors...
...like a peacock's tail.
Soot all over the place, you clumsy fool!
Get out!
Get out of my house!
And you can forget being paid this week!
Ungrateful little wretch.
No, you don't!
I won't tolerate any soot in this house!
There, just look at my boot!
It's filthy!
Out!
Out! And take this ridiculous-looking thing with you!
Where might Miss Amelia be this morning?
Good morning, Frances.
You're here early this morning.
A working man gets up early if he wants to have an effect on the world.
How true.
And what a powerful effect you have,
Frances.
Where have you been?
I've been chilled for half an hour.
Hurry up and light a fire.
And don't touch anything else with your dirty hands.
This is my room now, and I won't have you messing it up.
What is that awful smell?
When did you last have a bath?
What are you doing?
I don't believe in this!
So you can just stop it!
Stop it, I said!
What did you just do?
Just a little curse I learned from a witch in India.
Curse?
- What kind of curse?
- You'll see.
But I wouldn't brush my hair as much if I were you.
It's all right.
I saved it especially for you.
Go on. Take it.
Is this where you live?
You shouldn't be here.
It's too dangerous.
Why don't you like me anymore?
Did I do something wrong?
No, of course not.
I didn't think you'd want me for a friend...
...now that things are different.
I'm sure you could do fine without me for a friend...
...but I couldn't get along without you.
I'm sorry.
I should've known...
...you wouldn't be like the others.
- What's that?
- One knock means ''I'm here. ''
Two knocks means ''All is well. ''
Three means
''The coast is clear. ''
- ''The demon Minchinweed is asleep. ''
- It all sounds so adventurous!
Look, Becky. We have a visitor.
Hello, Becky.
Oh, Sara, I miss your stories so much.
Won't you tell us what happened to Rama and the princess?
The smoke from Ravana 's arrows...
...finally began to lift.
Rama lay dead on the ground.
Oh, no!
But then a wonderful thing happened.
The gazelle laid down next to Rama, giving him his own life.
He's suffering from amnesia...
...one of the rare side effects of poison gas.
His eyes will heal in time.
His memory...who can say?
He's not my son.
I'm sorry, Mr. Randolph.
He was in severe shock...
...with no coat, no identification.
Since your son was the only name unaccounted for...
...they assumed this was John.
I am sorry.
All the hoping.
You must think me a fool.
Is it your wish to be wise, sahib?
I don't know.
I suppose a wise man wouldn't have come here at all.
But if he had...
...he would have looked closely upon the soldier's face.
What would he have seen?
Pain, sahib.
He needs to be cared for.
He's not my responsibility.
A wise man would remember that this man was in John's regiment.
If his memory returns, he might tell what happened to his son.
Perhaps sahib will learn that John is in British hospital...
...wishing that a kind man would take him home, away from his pain.
If the plumber comes, show him the problem.
And don't babble with him.
He's paid by the hour.
And correct the Latin tests by the time I get back.
Yes, sister.
Hello, Miss Minchin.
Goodbye, Miss Minchin.
Oh, no, not again!
Lottie, not again.
Let's find the locket.
All right...
...it's okay. It's all right.
Come quick!
I think Lottie's possessed.
I got it.
Will you please get that child under control?
Don't worry. Everything's fine.
What is it?
I thought I saw a mouse.
Hello.
I swear, that child has a pact with Satan to destroy me.
I'm not cut out for this job.
I have no patience.
And teaching!
All those facts to remember.
I don't like it at all.
You like Frances, don't you?
What?
Of course not. How dare you.
I think he likes you too.
You do?
Really?
I think you should run away and get married.
It'd be terribly romantic.
What an extraordinary thing to say.
Well, anyway, my sister would be furious if she found out.
You'd be long gone by then.
Living in some exotic paradise...
...with that dashing young milkman.
I'd better get to the market.
You're doing well, young man.
You're almost home.
You must trust my eyes, sahib.
What's going on?
It's a surprise.
- What are you doing here?
- We brought you something.
Princess Sara, we present you with something we rescued.
In a dangerous adventure.
- Our very own crusade.
- Risking all our lives.
And mine too.
I don't know what to say.
You are the best friends anyone could ever ask for.
It's all right.
It's just my little monkey friend,
Hanuman.
Where did he come from?
Right next door. Look.
He likes to visit me.
Can you really talk to him, Sara?
Hanuman, say hello to all my friends.
After Rama came back to life...
...he raced towards the monster's palace to rescue Sita.
Suddenly...
...Ravana appeared!
I think we better save the rest for later.
What's going on here?
It's not their fault.
I asked them to come.
You five go downstairs.
I'll deal with you later.
Becky...
...you'll remain locked in your room tomorrow without meals.
Go!
And you will perform her chores in addition to your own...
...without breakfast, lunch or dinner.
It's time you learned...
...that real life has nothing to do with your fantasy games.
It's a cruel, nasty world out there...
...and it's our duty to make the best of it.
Not to indulge in ridiculous dreams, but to be productive and useful.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes, ma'am.
Good.
But I don't believe in it.
Don't tell me you still fancy yourself a princess.
Good God, child, look around you!
Or better yet, look in the mirror.
I am a princess.
All girls are.
Even if they live in tiny old attics.
Even if they dress in rags.
Even if they aren't pretty or smart or young.
They're still princesses.
All of us.
Didn't your father ever tell you that?
Didn't he?
If I find you up here with the girls again...
...I'll throw you out into the street!
What're we going to do?
A whole day with nothing to eat.
Don't cry, Becky.
I'm scared.
If Minchin throws me out,
I've got no place to go.
That's not true.
I'm here with you. I've always thought of us as sisters.
You have?
Let's make a promise to always look out for each other.
It's a promise.
Now, what are we going to do about food?
Starve, I guess.
No, there's only one thing to do.
We'll eat a great feast before we go to sleep...
...and that will keep us full tomorrow.
Feast? What feast?
Just look around.
See that table there?
It's covered with a beautiful cloth...
...and candles...
...and trays of good things to eat.
Come on, Becky.
Tell me what kind of food there is.
But I don't see any food.
Try, Becky.
Just make-believe it.
Remember what you told me?
About the magic?
- Muffins?
- Good! What kind?
All kinds.
Every kind of muffin God ever made, and all of them hot.
Good!
But we're not dressed right for such an elegant banquet.
I'm wearing a long velvet cape with fur on the collar.
And you?
Well,
I always liked diamonds myself.
Rings and bracelets, and a whole dress covered with them.
Smell those sausages!
I love sausages.
Oh, my Lord!
I think you went a little too far this time.
It wasn't me.
Go ahead.
I feel like I've been touched by an angel.
Look!
Just what we ordered.
I'm a little scared about this.
Me too.
Do you think we shouldn't eat it?
I'm not that scared.
Thank you for your kindness.
I'm sorry to inconvenience you.
It is nothing, sahib.
That word...
It sounds so familiar...
...yet I don't know what it means.
It is not English.
We use it where I am from.
In India.
India...
You know it?
No.
Everything's just a blur.
Maybe someday I'll sort it out.
You will, sahib.
You will.
Yoo-hoo?
One minute.
Oh, my God.
Where is it?
Where's the locket?
Give it to me!
What is all this?
Where'd it come from?
I don't know.
I just woke up and it was here.
You stole it, like you stole this locket!
You're nothing but a dirty little thief.
It's my responsibility to protect the children from animals like you.
You'll be leaving with the police very shortly!
No, Miss Minchin!
I didn't do it.
Miss Minchin, please!
Miss Minchin, I didn't do it!
You heard me.
I want her picked up immediately!
You've removed the bandages.
There wasn't much point.
I can see all right.
Come on in, have a brandy.
Don't worry.
I'm sure they'll believe you.
I have to get out.
But how? My room's locked too.
The police, they're here!
Let's go, boys.
Step lively now.
Quick, help me with this board!
- Right this way.
- Yes, madam.
You'll fall!
I can do it.
I'll come back for you.
I promise.
What is she doing?
Get back in here!
- The little beast is running away!
- We're trying, miss.
Good God!
Don't just stand there!
Go and find her!
Take this one while you're at it.
I heard you calling in your sleep last night.
Sometimes when I dream,
I sense a part of me that's missing.
It's strange, having your heart remember what your mind can't.
She jumped like a little animal.
Who's that at this hour?
Let us in, man.
A child from the school is in your house.
What's going on?
I'm sorry, but there's a child hiding in your house.
- What?
- Search upstairs.
Oh, not now!
Ram Dass, get some candles!
- Start with the attic.
- Let's go.
Quickly!
Who's there?
Make sure you check the closets and under the beds!
What is it?
Why are you crying?
Please tell me.
I won't hurt you.
Won't you tell me your name?
That's such a pretty name.
Papa.
Papa.
What did you say?
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, it's me, Sara.
Do you know me?
Don't you remember me?
Please...
...you've got to know me.
It's Sara. Remember?
Remember India and Maya?
Remember the Ramayana...
...and Emily?
The locket with Mama's picture?
Oh, Papa, please!
Papa, please!
Do you know this man?
Tell them!
This child has no father.
Take her away!
Papa!
I'm so sorry.
Sara!
Papa, don't ever leave me!
- I missed you.
- I love you.
Well, well, well.
I hardly recognized you.
I'm glad you straightened everything out.
They released all my property.
I came to say goodbye...
...and to thank you for everything you've done for us.
No more than you tried to do for my son.
- Take care, Mr. Randolph.
- And you too.
You must be glad to be going home.
Thank you.
I have a surprise for you all.
Whenever you think of me, tell Emily, and she'll get the message to me.
And when you hug her, you'll really be getting a hug from me.
Then we'll hug her every day.
That's the first time anyone's hugged Lavinia.
Bye, Becky.
Come on.
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Get over here.
I've been looking for you, Minchin.
- Pick up the bucket.
- When do I get my break?
Follow me!
What do you put in here, rocks?
Bye, Ram Dass!
- Bye, Hanuman!
- Cheerio!
Subed By HFN
MAN: The Mountains of Destiny mark the highest point in the whole of Fantasia.
It is here, in the Hidden Crystal Cave, that the Old Man of Wandering Mountain records 'The Neverending Story'.
Now what?
VOICE: Now what?
VOICE: What now?
(Voice echoes) Hold your horses!
I'm finding out!
There will be a day when the writing stylus will start to act strangely, making it increasingly difficult to record 'The Neverending Story'.
This is a sign that the Nasty is on the way - an evil force that first takes hold in young humans when they turn away from books and reading.
To stop the Nasty, even temporarily, would require a special young human - a voracious reader of great imagination and extraordinary courage.
Nicole?
MAN: Books listed according to the Dewey decimal system.
Check the card catalogue...
Shhh!
"Shhh"?
I'll do the shushing around here, young man!
Shushing is the job of the librarian and not some snotty little kid with hair that looks like the rear end of a porcupine.
Mr Coreander?
Mr Coreander, don't you remember me?
Bastian - Bastian Balthazar Bucks.
Bastian?
W-w-what in the world happened to you?
It's sort of hard to explain.
I see.
Why so far from home?
Not playing hooky from school, are we?
No. We moved.
This is my new school...
...unfortunately.
I see.
Well...
Stay here till the bell rings, but no longer.
Don't want to be late on your first day.
'Treasure Island'.
I remember this from your store.
Are the rest from there too?
Uh-huh.
(OMINOUS, MAGICAL MUSIC
PLAYS)
'The Neverending Story'.
That is strictly a reference book from now on.
It must not be taken from the library under any circumstances.
It keeps going.
Well, of course it keeps going.
Every move you make is part of your story.
Remember that the next time you pick your nose.
(Clears throat) Have to get more inventory from the car.
Remember, 'late first day, pay, pay, pay! '
"The Nasties"?
"One year after his second visit to Fantasia,
"Bastian's father finally found a woman he wanted to marry -
"a divorcee named Jane Baxter.
"Jane's house was more suited for a family of four
"which, for Bastian, meant a new room, a new neighbourhood,
"and worst of all, a new school."
Honey...
...where's Nicole?
Oh, she'll be right down.
"But maybe his dad was right and it would all be worth it.
"All his life
Bastian wanted a sister or brother
"to share his dreams and confide in his secrets.
"Now, at last, he'd have one."
Hey, kiddo!
This is a family effort.
Do you want to help?
They're not my family and this is not their house.
Nicole.
Dr Dumont said this would take time, but you've got to meet them halfway.
Why bother?
You'll only get divorced again.
Nicole, this is going to be different.
I promise you.
And just think what a cool new brother you have.
Yeah. Real cool.
This is my mom's sewing room, you know?
She loves sewing so much.
I'm really surprised she's letting you use it.
I know I wouldn't.
You can have one if you want.
I got plenty of them.
What for?
Crystals are so stupid.
Like crystals can really grant wishes!
Please...
...spare me this New Age garbage.
Crystals aren't supposed to grant wishes.
Only the Oran can do that.
Oran?
You can't tell this to anybody.
OK.
The Oran is the necklace of the Childlike Empress, the ruler of all Fantasia.
Please!
I'm not making it up.
It's all written.
In what - a book?
'The Neverending Story'.
(Scoffs) And I'm listening to you like this is real?
You are completely weird!
So, you two getting into trouble yet?
See? They're bonding already!
Oh.
(Sings) * I wish I still saw you
* Then I would be with you
* Days spent in the sun having fun
* Laughing alone
* But then something happened and you left me here
* All alone... *
Bye-bye, wife.
I'll be home around 6:00.
(Giggles) You look... handsome.
Thank you.
OK, kids, let's get this show on the road!
That was forceful.
I'm being too harsh, aren't I?
He needs more time.
Take your time, Bastian.
I can always write you a late note.
Jane, you had it right the first time.
I don't want him thinking
I'm a drill sergeant.
Downstairs! Look alive!
Let's go! Yee-hah!
Barney!
Been doing it since he was three. 'Bye.
'Bye.
I'll be pulling the car out of the garage.
You know, when you're ready.
You are not going to school like that.
Like what?
That is so un.
'Un'?
Uncool, unsophisticated, unhappening!
Just... un.
'Un'.
Mm-hm! I'll show you 'un'!
You are so weird.
Nicole!
Everyone's waiting to see my new so-called brother.
So-called?
* It has always been the same
* That's the call
That's the game
* And the pain stays the same. *
OK, kids, here we are.
Nicole, wait for Bastian.
Jane, would you happen to have a comb or a brush?
Honey, I think you should have thought of that before.
No, I don't, but don't worry.
You look perfectly... impressive.
Really.
(Whispers) lmpressive.
Impressive.
Oh, my God, the new brother!
GIRL: Is he for real?
I hope not.
Hey, Nicole.
Let's go!
Nicole!
NICOLE! Wait!
Where's the bathroom?
I gotta fix up my hair.
I can't show you right now.
Oh, my God!
Let's get out of here.
Nicole!
Nicole, come on!
Run!
Why? Who are they?
The Nasties!
The Nasties?
What's up, little homey?
Uh... yo, what is it?
Uh, I mean... yo, what it is?
Can you guys show me where the men's room is?
Ah... or at least tell me?
Dog, should we tell him or show him?
Ah, you know I hate those two-part questions, Slip.
Yeah. That's 'cause you've got a no-part brain.
Oh, OK.
Yeah.
This your first day here, squirt?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Ha.
Ha.
I think it'd only be right we personally escort you to the men's room.
Um, I can find it. I mean I really...
Ah...
So... you got a name?
Bastian Balthazar... Bucks.
Balthazar.
What kind of name's that?
You a Viking or something?
Don't forget to flush, Balthazar.
Yo, Mr John. What's up?
How many times are you dweezils going to repeat 12th grade?
Till we break the record.
Well, you ain't going to make it.
Principal said the next time he catches you here, you're expelled.
Yo, chill. We're only down here on a field trip.
We're checking the pipes for ecological violations...
Yeah.
And... stuff.
(Bastian knocks) Let me out!
Let me out!
(Clicks fingers) Open it.
Let me out!
Balthazar! Pal! Yeah!
Um... No, no!
We didn't lock him in there!
Mr John, we were sent down here to look for him.
Just ask him.
Ask him.
Can you really have them expelled?
Oh, yeah.
They kidnapped me and locked me in there to die!
Hey, Mr John, can't we discuss this?
I'm going to get you, Balthazar.
Nicole!
The story really is still happening.
Gotcha!
Help! Take me back to Fantasia!
Come on! Hurry up!
Come on!
It's my story! Return to Fantasia!
Escape the Nasties!
Where is he?
Where'd he go?
Find him!
Wash up first!
There's a terrible root rot going around.
Come and get it, sweetskins!
It's your favourite - frog and lizard puree.
Don't bother me now, wench.
Can't you see
I'm observing the night sky?
Same as yesterday and the day before that.
OH!
Aaaagh!
Two months of root rot - I finally get to sleep and now this!
Ow! Aaaagh!
(Engywook and Urgl grumble and mutter angrily)
It serves you right for sticking your foot in other people's potions!
If I was five feet taller I'd show you a thing or two, young man!
Bastian?
Engywook?
Welcome back, me boy!
Ha! Engywook!
Sorry I wrecked your house.
I must've taken a wrong turn... somewhere.
Ah, yes, well, inter-world travel is a very imprecise science.
I wrote a paper on that very subject, didn't I?
Yes, yes!
Alright!
It doesn't look so bad.
I can fix it.
When I get my hands on that slippery weasel, I'm going to rock his world.
Ah... Yo! Maybe he's hiding in one of these books!
Yo, Balthazar!
Did anybody check in there?
Yeah, just a pile of junk.
(HAUNTING, MAGICAL
MUSIC PLAYS)
'The Neverending Story'.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Ah!
I don't believe I've read that.
I must put it on my preferred reading list.
Why don't you put 'Learning to Read' on your preferred list first?
Why you always dissing me, man?
Why don't you look into the mirror and find out?
Shhhh!
"In order to escape the Nasties..."
The Nasties?
"...Bastian rushed inside the nearest door of the school library."
(Gasps) The Nasties - that's us!
Now how can something that's happening right now...
...be in this book?
It ain't possible!
"Slip, the leader of the Nasties, exclaimed to the others,
"'How can something that's happening right now be in this book?"'
Yo! I just said that.
Yeah.
"'Yo! I just said that."'
That is so cool! Let me try.
OK! (Clears throat)
Um... the-the print's too small.
You know what it is?
Your brain is too small.
The print is fine.
"Safe at last among his tiny little friends,
"Bastian settled in front of the patched-up gnome hovel,
"chewing on the last tiny morsels of a gnome-cooked meal.
"When he finished his account
"of what brought him back to Fantasia,
"Engywook popped a fresh toothpick in his nearly toothless mouth,
"shook his onion-sized bald head and sighed to his human friend..."
That's quite a story, young man.
These Nasties sound downright... nasty!
Are you finished with your snake patties, dearie?
Snake patties?
Snake! Yeah, I'm finished.
Where exactly is the book now, Bastian?
It is in a safe place, isn't it?
(DISTANT WOLF HOWLS
OMINOUSLY)
Well, uh...
"It's safe alright."
I smell wood burning!
Well, if Balthazar could make up anything he wanted to happen in Fantasia while he read this book, maybe we could make a few things happen to him...
...while he's there.
What are we waiting for?
Let's get NASTY!
What's this?
They said it'd be sunny today.
Oooh! I think I'll take a raincheck here.
Whoa! Careful!
Watch the leaves, will ya?!
Ooooh!

Oh, no, it's me!
Quick! Call the fire department!
Call anybody!

Get up, you old fool!
Get inside! Get inside now!
Come on, you daft old bat!
I knew this would happen! I...

Help me, kid! I need a wig!
What about us?!
Um... ah...
Nest! Get in his nest!
BOTH: No way!
Man...
...what can I do?
Ain't nothing you can do!
I'm the king. You're my slave!
The Nasties must have
'The Neverending Story'!
They're the ones making this stuff happen.
Well, go back and stop them before they destroy everything!
I can't get back without the book.
There is one other means of inter-world transportation.
The Oran.
The Empress has the Oran in the lvory Tower.
Onward to Silver City!
(Faint voice) This is positively and absolutely the last time I'm flying!
Falkor!
Huh? Bastian, is that you?
Falkor, land!
Land?!
I can't land down there.
I need a runway.
Come on, you can land anywhere.
You're a luck dragon!
A luck dragon, huh?
If I was a luck dragon
I'd be halfway to Vegas.
It's not a dragon.
It's an overgrown pink poodle.
Oh, no! I'm losing altitude!
Look out below!
(Shouts) Aaaaaaagh!
Look out!
Oh, I hate this part of the story!
(Screams) Aaaaaaaaagh!
(Squeals happily) Wee!
Falkor!
Ow! I think I've skinned my snout.
Falkor, you did great!
Ohh...
(Exclaims) Am I still in one piece?
We need a ride to Silver City to see the Empress.
Not with me. I just came from there.
Everyone's acting crazy there too.
What about the lvory Tower?
Did the Nasty reach there too?
Yes, they did.
And the Empress?
I heard she escaped to the Wandering Mountains.
That's where we must go!
Wait, that's just what I heard.
It could be just a rumour.
This is no weather for mountain flying.
We'll have to chance it, you pink wimp!
Bastian needs the power of the Oran to get him back to the human world so he can stop this thing before it ruins us all!
Hurry up, let's go. Come on!
With my root rot, I'm walking!
Come on, Barky!
Alright, alright!
I'm sitting in the middle.
You are not getting me up in the air in that thing!
Not a chance!
(WONDROUS MUSIC PLAYS,
WIND RUSHES)
Hang on, Barky, hang on.
Hang on to what?
There's no handles, no seat belts, no in-flight catering.
I'm getting a stiff neck from the draught.
We should have walked!
I... want to get down!
Oh, be quiet. Enjoy the view.
Well... you wanna know what's next, Bastian?
First we're gonna take over the Wandering Mountains and then the Hidden Crystal Cave.
Then there'll be no place for you and your little freaky friends to hide!
Someone's coming!
Ooh! Shouldn't we clean up first?
No. Leave it for that numbskull janitor.
Bastian, were we?
Bastian Balth!
Shush, will you?!
Oh, I hate birds! (Hums)
Mmm! (Stamps loudly)
Go AWAY!
(Sings) * I was born in the Rockies made out of stone
* I'm high like a mountain and I love rock'n'roll. *
Oh... Junior!
I said no more rocks before lunch!
I'm hungry.
Now, stop!
(Snorts) Did someone say,
"Rocks before lunch"?
Mmm. No!
Honeykins, would you mind going over to Wandering Mountains and breaking off about a half a pound of limestone for me, hmm?
For you, honeykins, anything.
Oh.
Mmm!
Mmm!
(Laughs) You still turn my lips to lava!
Oh, go on now!
Oh, Dadda, me come too!
And don't forget the sedimentary sauce!
I won't.
Junior? Oh, Junior!
Junior go buggy! (Laughs)
Dadda, me come too.
Pick up me, pick up me.
OK, Junior. Alright.
Strong like your dadda.
Help me.
Dadda, HELP ME.
You can do it. (Chuckles)
Let's roll!
OK, Junior, let's go shopping!
Yay, yay, yay!

* Head out on the highway

Oh, what now? I have a visitor?
ECHOING MALE VOICE: Visitor!
Visitor!
A visitor?
Hurry, open the door!
Empress! Oh-oh,
I-I-I... alright. (Shudders)
Come in.
Empress, what an honour!
What an honour!
It's so nice to have company.
This isn't a social call, Old Man.
A terrible plague has overrun the Silver City.
I was driven from the lvory Tower by a force so powerful...
...even the Oran couldn't stop it.
Fortunately, I was able to, hmm, butt us through to the secret tunnel for our escape.
Well... that's using your head.
Mmm...
It's no time for cheap head jokes.
We must do something.
What does the Great Book say?
This evil force is known as the Nasty and comes from the human world.
The human world?
So that's why
Oran has no effect on it!
But how's it controlling Fantasia?
Alas, I'm afraid the Nasty humans now possess 'The Neverending Story'.
Well, then, get out of here! It's $5!
Yeah, alright!
You must go there.
I'll use the Oran's powers to wish you there immediately.
No. (Stammers) Hold it, hold it.
Mmm?
My dear Royal Empress of all that is wonderful and imaginative...
...what you need is a special young human, a voracious reader of great imagination and extraordinary courage.
That's what it says in the Great Book.
Here.
Hmm...
I shall call on the Oran.
Oh, great Oran, bring me the human hero who will save Fantasia from the Nasty.
(THUNDERING SOUNDS,
MAGICAL MUSIC)
Bastian!
Oh, show some respect, will ya?!
It's freezing in here.
But it's a lot safer!
Oh, yeah! I hope those stalactites are screwed in tight!
Uh? Yeah.
Ooh, ooh! My beloved Empress!
I was so worried
I caught the first flight...
Shh! Quiet!
Empress, how are you?
Not well.
But the Oran has brought me a hero to save Fantasia.
Excuse me, your Royal Highness.
May I make a humble little interjection here?
Quiet, gnome! There's no time!
The Nasty's on its way here!
Soon, we could be at each other's throats.
Good! Why not start now?
Stop! We must not give in to the Nasty!
Let the gnome speak.
This better be good!
Bastian's heart is strong.
But he's not exactly
Arnold Schwarzenegger in the muscle department, is he?
No!
Shut up!
The Oran can provide the transport.
But when he gets back to the human world how's he going to get the book away from these thugs?
The gnome is right.
Told ya.
You will take the Oran with you.
You shall wish yourself back to the human world, then use the Oran's power to return the book to the Keeper's safe hands.
But... you must only use it to stop the Nasty.
Then you must return it to me.
Back, back, back. Get back!
Give the boy wishing room.
Here goes.
Oh, kid!
If you want to travel back to another world, Bastian, you'll have to wish harder than that!
I can't.
If the kid wishes any harder he'll break his wishbone!
Hey, don't go too far, Junior.
Come on! What's the big deal?
Time for me to lend him a helping branch.
Here, grab a twig.
Come on, grab his ear, Bastian.
Ohh, Bastian! Hi, Dadda.
Junior, come back!
Oh! It's Junior.
Me play too. (Laughs)
BARKY: Hold tight! Hold the branch.
ENG YWOOK: Be careful!
Dadda!
Oh, me toes!
(Voice echoes) Dadda, help me!
But they've all gone!
Ah! There's been a wish overload, you see.
Don't worry, my tasty little toadstool, we're safe.
You see, we and the others weren't making physical contact.
Aaaagh!
Ah! Oooh!
Your body's gone!
Well, your body went years ago!
What the?! (Exclaims)
No. This must not happen.
Fantasians, come back.
They're lost, Old Man.
Help me. What do I do?
Oh, Empress, I'm a mere chronicler.
What can I do?
Bastian, can you hear me?
I have something of great importance to tell you!
The book! (Pants)
I wish 'The Neverending Story' would leave the Nasties and return here...
No, Bastian, stop!
Empress?
The Fantasians who helped you got caught in a wish overload and are there with you in the human world.
You mustn't use the Oran's powers to stop the Nasty.
Why not?
Because the new Fantasia that follows will be different.
It won't include them.
It's my imagination. I'll just... make sure they're in the new Fantasia.
No, Bastian. You must find them.
Bring them all together and bring them back to Fantasia before you return the book to the Keeper.
Or they will be lost forever.
OK.
(Sniffs) I'm really gonna miss the old school!
What's new? You've been missing school for five years!
Yo, check this out.
"Bastian always wanted a sister or brother
"to share his dreams and secrets.
"Now, at last, he would have one."
Only problem is, he's stuck in Fantasia.
Maybe we'll let him send her a postcard!
Balthazar!
He's back!
Let's split.
Hey!
What if he tells the cops?!
Let him.
We didn't do nothin'.
He stole the book. It says so right in 'The Neverending Story'.
(Shouts) Aaaaaagh...
Wow! Something tells me
I'm not in Fantasia anymore!
Doesn't seem to be anybody else around up here.
I hope I'm not the only flying creature in these parts.
Oh, pardon me, ma'am!
May I talk to you for a second?
I'm a little lost.
BARKY: Ay, where am I?
Last time I'm making any wishes.
Where is that kid?
Uh, pardon me, ladies.
Any of you seen a human about 1.5 roots tall, goes by the name of Bastian Bucks, hmm?
Ahh! Don't worry, lady,
I'm not gonna steal your pine cones.
Huh, what is this place?
Hey, uh, balsam, hemlock, fir, oak, aspen, maple even!
Ooh! Look at the bark formation on that one!
I've never seen anything like it!
Is this a Greenpeace convention?
Oh, no, chainsaw massacre!
(Exclaims) Oh!
Ugh! Yuck!
Uncle Rocky?
Help, help!
There's a murderer back there!
Oh, no!
Oh, God, I've gotta get out of this awful place!
Oh, wait a minute!
MAN: They're going over to second grade.
OK, let's move it out.
That gives me... an idea.
Mmm!
Ooh! Yum-meeeeeee!
(Whimpers) I no like it!
Hang on, kid, I'll save ya!
Er... with a little luck.
Hang in there, kid!
(Whimpers) Oh, oh, oh...
(Screams) Ow!
(Yells faintly) Dadda!
Here I come!
(Exclaims) Oh, Dadda!
Gotcha!
Ow! This won't help my back problem.
I hungry.
Huh? OK, OK.
We'll stop at the next rock pile.
Ooh, goody!
(Rappers sing) * Hear the formality
* Get on the front seat... *
* Show your personality
Be who you wanna be... *
Honey, I'm home!
It is so cool to have a nice family to come home to!
Barney...
Sis watching TV.
How was your day?
Fine.
Great!
Barney...
And Bastian...
I'll bet he's upstairs studying already.
Barney, the school called today.
It seems Bastian cut his first three classes.
And he... well, he stole a book - something called 'The Neverending
Story' - from the school library.
Barney...
What are you looking for?
Nothing.
You wanna talk?
I can't. I'm busy right now.
Any, um... problems with the new school?
Making any friends?
I'm fine, OK?!
(Chuckles) OK.
It's just that, um...
...sometimes it... helps to get things off your chest.
This is all new to you.
It'll be tough for a while.
So, there's nothing you wanna?
No.
Dad?
Yeah?
Everything sucks.
OK?
OK.
Guys, you've gotta find me.
I'll never find you.
The world's too big for a kid without a driver's licence.
Who were you talking to?
Uh, no-one.
I was... singing a song.
It's country and western.
My mom and your dad think you have gone bonkers.
They're talking about having you committed to a mental institution.
Oh, well. At least Mom will get her sewing room back.
Oh, very funny!
Oh, where did you get this - the Empress?
Can't believe you actually expect people to believe all this stuff.
I don't care what they believe.
I don't get it.
Why don't you... just show us something from this Fantasia place of yours?
(Sighs) I-I... I can't.
I wish I could, bu...
But... (Gasps)... I can't!
Fine. Have it your way.
"Bastian sadly clutched the Oran...
"...unable to make the one wish that would set things right in Fantasia
"and allow him to get on with his own life...
"...in the human world."
"Bastian returned to his telescope
"hoping against hope for some sign of his Fantasian friends.
"As the night wore on, his eyes grew heavier and heavier
"until he fell gently off to sleep."
Because now I'm gonna rock his life in the human world.
I'll make sure he never gets a sister.
I like that.
Um, chief?
You think maybe we should get our hands on that Koran thing first?
It's Oran...
...YOU MORON!
But maybe you have a point.
If those Fantasians can show up any minute now...
...before we even get a chance to read about it, this book could go flying from our hands.
Wait, Slip...
Let's steal the necklace.
And then we get the book... forever.
Permanent control over Balthazar's story.
Falkor!
Falky, look.
Fantasia!
Oh, I don't think so.
But let's go check it out.
Ah!
Oh, pretty! Fantasia?
It may not be Fantasia but there's some cute dragons here.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Heeeeey! You're nice!
Falkor!
Look over there.
Where? Oh, yeah!
Oh, boy! It's Bastion.
There!
Junior!
Bastian.
Oh, great. You two OK?
Dog! Sic the necklace!
I mean it! Just go! Go!
(Whimpers) OK.
Get it, Dog!
Go!
Don't be a wimp!
Hungry, Bastion!
Let's get out of here.
Ha, ha, ha! Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
Yeah!
So long, my little fortune cookies!
I'll be back!
No Fantasia, Bastian.
(Nasties mutter and shout with frustration)
Well, genius, got any ideas where we are?
Oh, yes.
It's definitely the human world.
The weather's so unpredictable.
You see, there's this gigantic hole...
Yes. And it's right in the middle of your face.
Now, why don't you shut it?
Shush!
Oh, it's slippery.
Come on.
You're breathing rather heavily.
Federal Express.
There is one problem, my little squashed cumquat.
We appear to be several thousand miles from Bastian's house.
Oh, you nit-sized nitwit!
No, no, I can invent a small flying machine, but it may take me some time.
Ohhh!
Good evening.
Evening, Mr McKenzie.
When will it arrive?
Ah, tomorrow afternoon.
Come on. Get inside.
I'll change the label to Bastian's address when the coast is clear.
I hope we get some advantage miles for this.
The Nasty could be at
Wandering Mountain already.
If it gets to the Empress it's all over for Fantasia.
Fly faster, Falkor!
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say!
My back is killing me.
Alright, let's head to my house.
I'll stay there with Junior and you keep searching.
Oh, alright.
Oh! Mm-mm.
Oh! You are home!
I was beginning to worry about you and Junior with all this nasty weather.
Ah... where is Junior?
Well, he's... Ohhhh.
Where's Junior?
Well, he, er...
Where's the rest of him?
He's in the human world.
(Gasps) Ohhhhh!
Oh, no.
Oh, that's better.
Bye-bye.
With luck he'll find them by morning.
Come on.
Sleepy sleep.
Oh, why is it always me?
You'll sleep in here.
Nobody will notice you.
I'm tired now.
Ah. Mmm.
OK. Right here.
Don't come out for any reason whatsoever.
Kissy kiss?
Mmm.
Goodnight.
(Sighs) Mmmm.
(MUSIC BO X PLAYS
'ROCK-A-BYE BABY')
Mama.
(MOBILE CONTINUES PLAYING
LULLABY)
Junior.
My baby.
A-choo!
(Shouts) I hungry, Bastian.
Shhh!
Ooh!
Stop it! Come on, Junior. No!
Stop it! No!
Slippy!
I think it's coming from the kitchen.
Shh. We've got the element of surprise on our side.
No. It's for humans only!
(RATTLING AND
SCUFFLING SOUNDS)
Aaagh!
Me hungry!
Barney!
(BANGING AND CLATTERING
NOISES)
Ooh, I like these!
No! Junior, no!
No! No!
(SMASHING AND BANGING
SOUNDS)
Uh-oh.
(Bellows) Haiiiii-ya!
Uh, hiya... Bastion.
You mind telling me why you're running all those machines?
I just... came down for a late-night snack and then I decided to sorta...
...test to make sure everything in the kitchen was in working order.
At one o'clock in the morning?
Good work, Bastian.
Yes. Always good to do that sort of thing during low-usage hours.
Very cost conscious of you.
Gee. Neat necklace.
Thanks.
Where did you get that?
Ahhh... a pawn shop.
A pawn shop?
Barney.
Come on. Let him be.
Don't stay up too late, Bastian, OK?
Sleepy sleep with Bastian?
No, you can't sleepy sleep with Bastian.
Ohhhh.
Please.
OK, but keep it quiet.
Oh!
If that's possible.
I happy!
Come on, Junior. Tippy-toes.
I'm not tired.
Shhh!
(Yawns) But I'm not tired.
Another great idea bites the dust!
Where am I now?
Everything hurts.
Just what I need!
Get away from me!
I'm warning you!
I've seen that look before.
Shoo! You're barking up the wrong tree.
Hmm. Me like red one.
Me like blue one.
Mmm!
Oh! Oh!
Can I come in?
JUNIOR: Come in!
BASTIAN: No, you can't.
Can I come in?
No! I'm getting dressed.
JUNIOR: Come in!
OK. Come in.
SONG * I'm on a mission
I'm on mission
* I'm on a mission of love... *
I know - I look... un.
Oooh.
I didn't say anything.
Don't be so paranoid.
What are you looking for?
Nothing.
JANE: Kids! Come on.
Let's go.
Hiya!
NICOLE: Coming.
Hiya!
Hiya!
Get off!
Good game.
Shhh. Shhh.
I have to go to school now, OK?
Ohh! Me come too, Bastian.
Like I don't have enough problems already.
Look out that window.
When the car leaves, go to where I took you 'sleep sleep' and wait there until I get back.
Kiss kiss?
Do again.
Again?
Yeah.
God, it's like kissing a sidewalk.
Ah, nice Bastian.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
(Laughs) Ooh!
Oooh.
Wish wish.
Mmm. Tell Bastian.
SONG: * Na-na-na, na-na, na na-na
* Talk about you and me, yeah
* And the games people play... *
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Bastian.
* Na-na-na, na-na, na na-na
* Talking about you and me, yeah... *
JUNIOR: Wish wish gone.
Me want go home!
(Wails) See Mama, Dadda!
Go away! Can't a man chew his rocks in peace?
Well, you shouldn't be so nasty.
Nasty? Who's being nasty?
Junior always gets into trouble when he is with you.
What?
Would you rather he lay around the cave all day helping you with those mud cakes?
And what's wrong with my mud cakes?
Well, now that you mention it, after 2,000 years of marriage they still taste like hockey pucks!
Hockey pucks?!
Ow!
Hmmmm!
I say this is my story.
I'm gonna get you for this.
But, chief, the necklace!
Chill!
We're supposed to be expelled, remember?
Let's wait till the 3:00 bell so we can take him outside without no-one noticing.
Nicole. Rachel!
Guys!
Hi. Want to go to the mall after school?
My mom's driving.
Cool. We're in.
No way. I am like so broke.
So am I.
But that's why I carry plastique.
You'll find this at the Principal's office, young lady.
But that's my mom's gold...
And if we don't get to our home room, we'll find ourselves at the Principal's office.
Nicole. What have we there?
Nothing.
Hand it over.
I can't.
It doesn't belong to me.
That's all the more reason.
Let's see it.
I wish you would just...
Yes?
We were saying?
We wish...
I wish...
We... wish... what?
I wish... you would just leave me alone, leave all of us alone and stop breathing your camel breath on us and go back to your cage where you belong.
Class...
I must leave you all now.
My cage needs tidying.
No way.
Way.
Nicole!
Nicole, wait!
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.
Gotcha! (Sniggers)
Ow! Ow! Come on!
Hello, Mother.
Hello, dear.
Can I come to the mall with you guys?
I thought you were broke.
Well... I don't need any money.
Oh, how nice. Your mother finally got you a charge card?
Which one?
All of them.
OK. Balthazar.
Lay it on me.
Lay what on you?
No games, Balthazar.
Let's see the gold.
I don't have it.
Frisk him.
Oh! Ugh!
Where did you hide it?
I didn't hide it.
You wanna make things harder on us? OK.
We're gonna make things
A lot harder for you.
We'll check the book, find out where the necklace is and when we get it you can kiss your new family goodbye.
Bastian!
I hungry!
I...
Shhh.
You got it?
Yeah, I got it.
OK.
Stay here. Bark Troll.
Oh. Me come too.
This your order?
Ah, yeah.
Sign here.
Where do you want it?
I'll take care of him.
Him?
Ah, yeah. Um...
Haven't you read... you know,
'The Secret Life of Plants'?
Trees are people too.
Oh, yeah?
This one looks like he'd be better off in a woodchipper.
Whoa!
Hey, Tom!
Oh!
Have a nice trip? (Laughs)
What are you looking at?
Let's go.
Oooh. Have they gone?
You made it.
Some place you got here, this human world.
How did you find me?
I let my branches do the walking.
Luckily there's only one Bucks in the phone book else I'd be walking all day.
Oooh!
Not that pile of rocks again.
Just what I need.
Now we go home?
Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh! Ow!
Get off the roots!
Stay here with Junior.
Shhh!
Me go home!
Junior, take it easy.
Shut up!
(Faintly) Me go home!
Bastion Bucks lives here?
Yes.
Right.
Thank you.
Can you sign here?
Sure.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
You too.
"Living Things - Handle With Care."
ENG YWOOK: Let us out!
Oh, no!
There's no floor!
There's no bathroom here!
I've got to go!
Ohhhhhhh!
Bastion... there's a package here for you.
And there seems to be something -
I don't know how to say this - speaking inside.
Help us!
Oh, um...
...this must be... er... the parrot... I sent for.
Um... by the way, have you... seen Nicole?
Er... she called to say she went to the mall.
The mall. OK. 'Bye.
Shhhh!
Stop!
Let us out!
Ohhhhhh! Candy?
Let us out!
There's no time.
We gotta go.
BOTH: No! We've got to go!
Ugh!
Do you see what I see?
Hey, that's it!
If anybody says anything to you, just say, "Trick or treat?"
Twick or tweat?
Don't put words in my knothole.
I'm 300 years older than you.
You wanna end up in a botanical garden?
Twick or tweat!
OK, trick or treat.
This is so embarrassing.
Oooooh! That's so gross!
My costume's real.
Where'd you get yours - K-Mart?
Ooh, pretty!
Yeah, yeah.
She looks like leaf mould.
If this is the way you humans amuse yourselves, take me back to Fantasia!
(Chuckles) What a dweeb!
OK, come on, guys.
Balthazar's sister's right upstairs.
ALL: Whooo!
SONG: * I'm so happy I'm a girl
* 'Cause I'm a girly girl... *
Oh, it fits so perfectly.
I really wish I had this dress.
You look just stunning in that.
Darling, it's yours.
Could you wrap it up in big, fluffy bows?
Fluffy bows?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
We're awfully busy.
I really wish you would.
Red... or blue?
Red.
Oh, look! They're havin' a sale in the garden department!
There's no time for shopping.
Let's split up.
If you guys find Nicole, bring her back here.
Watch him.
Oh, great!
Leaves me with the mini-landslide!
We go see toys!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Just don't expect me to change your diapers.
* There was a girl looking so delicious
* Standing at the bar in front of me
* The guy who touched her hand is looking pretty
* Now he's turned around watching me... *
Right, you've convinced me.
I'll take it.
* I am so happy I'm a girl
* 'Cause I'm a girly girl
* Come over here, little boy
We gotta twist and turn
* 'Cause I'm a girly girl
I'm a girly girl... *
Hmm. A little more purple.
You know something?
In all the time I've been Empress, it never occurred to me to go shopping with the Oran.
Well, that's because you serve a higher purpose, my Empress.
Oh.
Here's where we spread out and get the gold.
SONG: * We're livin' in a nasty world... *
Oooh! Funny!
Let's see a smile here.
Come on.
Next!
Me!
CHILD: You bully!
It was my turn!
Twick or tweat!
Twick or twea!
* This is the time to change your mind
* Maybe together
* We can be strong so give a sign... *
Ugh! Bastion!
When are you going to return that book?
Mr Coreander, have you seen my sister?
I wasn't aware you had a sister.
I don't.
I mean... not a real one.
Look, I gotta find her before...
...the Nasties do!
* Don't believe an illusion
* You're never gonna change the world... *
Got it!
* Livin' in a nasty world... *
Whoo-hoo-hoooo!
Hey! Come back here!
Nicole, where's the Oran?
He just took it!
Ohhh! I've got the Oran!
I've got the Oran!
Had the Oran!
(Screams) Ooh! Aaagh!
Nicole, hurry! She's got the Oran!
She's got it! She's got it!
She has got it!
Come and get it, Balthazar!
She's getting away!
Hey! Wait for me!
Ahhh, I'm going back to the garden department.
(FRENZIED, VIOLENT MUSIC
POUNDS)
Where'd they go?
I don't know.
They must've used the Oran to disappear.
What'll happen if you don't get the Oran back?
Don't you realise what you've caused?
The entire civilisation of Fantasia will go down the toilet!
And maybe ours will go down with it.
I really hope you enjoyed your little shopping spree.
Oh, Nicole!
Now I'll be telling the story forever, Balthazar.
Yo, Empress!
Check it out, Wilma -
I'm the new keeper of the book.
My name is not Wilma.
Oh!
Yo, Large Head! What's up?
And, um... Old Man, you've got more company coming.
Then Bastian has failed and the Fantasia that we know will be a thing of the past.
Let's get outta here!
Barky! Let's go!
Bastian!
Come on, Barky!
Wait! I'm not validated.
Oh! Ow!
Stop shaking us around, you great lump of lumber!
Ah! It's gridlock out here!
Hundreds of humans are testing out their air bags at the same time!
These creatures are crazy!
(ANGRY SHOUTING,
BANGING AND SMASHING
Why are they all being so nasty?
Mr Coreander?!
Yo! Chief!
What about the luck dragon?
(Groans) This is not my favourite part of the story.
Looks like he's out of luck.
BARNEY: Stay with me, Jane!
Where is... Oh, God!
There they are! There they are!
Bastian!
Why didn't you say you were coming here?
It's like Armageddon out there.
I keep telling you, let me know where you're going.
Nicole, look at you.
GIRL: Nicole, would you take your stuff now, please?
Where'd you get the money for all this?
They gave it to me.
They gave this to you?!
Nicole, sweetie,
I don't quite understand.
The stores just decide to give
Nicole half their inventory?!
I want the truth, young lady, and I want it now!
I wished for it.
What?!
Barney, give her a chance to explain.
Don't tell me what to do, Jane!
See? I knew this would happen!
Nicole!
You come back here this second!
Dad!
The Nasty is controlling you!
Don't give in to the darkness.
Come on!
This is so cool!
No, no!
Vile creatures, stay out!
Let them in, you globe-domed geek!
Empress, you said no cheap head jokes.
So sue me! Huh!
Honeykins, can you come in here?
What is it now?
Yaaaaa!
Is that the best you can do?
Ugh!
(Roars) Eeeeeow!
BASTIAN: Nicole!
Nicole! Wait!
Nicole!
Nicole!
Hey!
Let me go!
Your mom and my dad are at each other's throats.
I don't care!
You must!
They're our parents! We're a family!
No, we're not! It's better this way.
Better to do it now.
Do what now?
Let them fight and get divorced.
My parents used to fight all the time.
First my dad would yell at me, then they'd yell at each other!
It's all happening again!
It's not! It's the Nasty!
We have to stop it!
You can't stop it. I tried.
No matter what I did it didn't stop.
They still got divorced.
This is my story and I'm not gonna let it happen.
Bastian!
Bastian!
Are you OK?
What happened?
I thought you were electrocuted.
It scared me.
Bastian, I'm gonna help you get the Oran back.
Why should you help?
At least this way your mom will get her stupid sewing room back.
(Voice echoes) Bastian. Bastian.
What? I look too 'un' for you?
Stop it!
Unsophisticated? Uncool?
I'm sick of it!
You're a spoilt little brat!
Stop it!
It's the Nasty that's doing this, not you.
You would never act this way.
Don't you understand?
You're too nice.
Oh, yeah!
I want it to be your room.
I'm sorry for all the mean things
I ever said to you.
I want you to be my brother.
You really do want me for a brother?
Yes.
I just didn't want to get hurt again.
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!
Let's jam!
Want to go home!
Yeah, yeah. I miss Fantasia too.
BOTH: So do we!
Alright! Alright already!
We'll go back to the toy department.
Hold your boulders, will ya...
Whoa!
(Slip reads) "Bark Troll's branch pushes the dumpster aside
"and then they step inside the Nasties' hide-out.
"And Bark Troll exclaimed..."
BOTH: "Oh, no! It's an ambush!"
Hands off.
Hey, don't touch the bark.
I'm 300 years old.
Show some respect.
Kissy kiss?
(Whimpers) Barky!
EMPRESS: Come on!
Vile crustacean!
My Empress, don't give in to the Nasty!
Empress! Help me!
This is where we lost them.
They're not here now.
(Engywook shouts) If I were six feet taller I'd pulverise you!
You hear that?
I did.
Go!
(Keeps yelling) Come down to my size and I'll have you, my lad!
Balthazar! (Laughs)
What took you so long?
You know, I've been reading all about your mommy and your daddy.
Things are getting a little nasty over at the Bucks residence.
You made it that way!
No. You did!
And you too.
Don't go blaming it on me.
I didn't put those words into your parents' mouths.
They said it themselves.
Don't you care about anything?!
You have to live in the human world after all this too.
If you destroy everything it'll be bad for you!
And you and everybody!!
He's right, chief!
Give him the necklace back.
I don't want anything bad happening to my mother.
Wanna know something? Something bad already happened to your mother.
What?
You!
Oh!
I've got the Oran!
I've got the Oran!
You've lost the Oran!
(Whoops) Ooh, yeah!
SLIP: What are you doing?
I wish...
Nicole, the book!
Big man, Balthazar...
...when you got the necklace.
Put it down.
Put it down!
Then we'll see what a big man you are.
In front of your sister!
Don't do it!
You've got the Oran!
You can turn him into a duck.
I frightened, Bastian.
(Reads) "Bastian placed the necklace down...
"...then put into practice all those years of... karate lessons."
ALL: Karate lessons?!
"'Ha-ha! Karate lessons! ' yelled
Slip, bursting with laughter."
What are you doing?
I only took two lessons!
"Bastian starts circling, waiting for his moment to attack."
(Junior whimpers) Go home, Bastian!
(Grunts) Ooh-hoo-hoo!
I'm sorry! That's what it says.
To heck with what the book says.
BARKY: Careful, Bastian.
Take it easy.
"All at once,
"it was if Bastian was transformed into a deadly combination
"of Bruce Lee, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme."
Don't worry, chief.
It's just a bluff.
"Bastian blocks Slip's attack and counters with a karate chop
"and then... kicks him away."
I'll kill him! Come on!
Go on! Go on!
Give him a left!
"Bastian turns from Slip
"and performs a miraculous flying kick to Dog."
ENG YWOOK: Yes! Come on, lad!
Careful, Bastian.
I'm back!
Falkor!
"They see Falkor and... run for their lives!"
Get off! Get off!
We go home now.
Hooray! Ha-hah!
Get the...
Ah... perhaps not.
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh, no! What now, huh?
(Reads) "Meanwhile, back at Jane's house,
"Barney and Jane's short honeymoon had turned into a living nightmare.
"After only one week of marriage,
Barney decided to call it quits."
Let me see that.
(Reads) "And over in the Rockchewers' dwelling, things were just as bad."
(Gasps) Dadda?
From now on, woman...
...l'm going to be a rolling stone!
Fine with me! Hmmph! Fool.
Oh, no! They've taken my story to the future!
All this stuff's already happened.
Don't come back!
Don't worry, I won't!
(Voice echoes) No, Dadda!
No leave Mama!
Hmm... no. Must be dreaming.
(Voice echoes) No, Daddy! Don't go!
Nicole?
Nicole, Falkor's here now.
We have to wish the Fantasians back before we get rid of the Nasties.
Ah... l'm gonna miss you, kid.
Bye-bye, Barky. I'll miss you.
You too, Falkor.
'Bye, Bastian.
Ooooh!
Yes, you too, Junior.
'Bye, Bastian.
I go home now.
Alright, everybody, get in wish position.
ENG YWOOK: Good luck, lad.
Dadda!
We wish that Fantasia would go back to how it was before this Nasty business started.
Oooooh!
It worked!
(Jane sobs) Barney!
Barney!
No! Please, don't go, Dad!
Don't go!
Nicole!
I'm home!
Are you OK?
Hi, Mom!
Bastian! (Laughs)
I was worried sick about you, you crazy kid!
Are you sure you're OK?
You'll never believe what happened, Dad!
Oh, I think I might believe what happened.
Welcome home, Nicole!
Dr Dumont said it would work out!
I hope you learned something, kid.
Be careful what you wish - you might wind up trapped in a shopping mall!
Me - I wish small.
I got new leaves.
I got a new lease of life!
Bye-bye, Barky!
Oh, ah... look! There's your daddy!
Go kiss him.
(Shouts joyfully) Mama! Dadda!
I'm home!
My baby!
Junior!
Oh!
He's home!
If I can just get the root rot to clear up, everything will be fine.
Hi.
Bastian and Nicole! Hi!
Nicole, you know my girlfriend Marcia.
I do?
Sure you do.
You kids better run along.
We mustn't be late for our classes.
Heavens, no.
Gosh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
'Bye.
'Bye.
See you later.
'Bye.
Well, sis, how'd you like the ending?
You did that?
(Laughs) Yeah!
The story's not over yet, young man.
Run along.
BOTH: Yeah!
Now this is my favourite part of the story!

{2729}{2775}The genetics wing.
{2777}{2862}I'II remind you we are|in the vanguard of research.
{3844}{3918}Get KIump in here now.
{3919}{3966}- Professor KIump.|- Good mornin'.
{3967}{4014}- Hey, Professor!|- Good mornin'!
{4015}{4062}- Morning.|- Mornin'.
{4063}{4138}- Good morning, Professor KIump.|- Morning. How are you?
{4334}{4407}Mornin'.
{5236}{5295}Aaaaaah!
{5383}{5431}Oh, my goodness.
{5656}{5715}Professor KIump, the cages-|what happened?
{5716}{5817}That is most pecuIiar, Jason,|because I distinctIy remember|Iocking up Iast night.
{5819}{5903}I Iocked these cages, picked up|my portfoIio and turned around-
{6044}{6097}Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
{6099}{6158}I must've grazed the switch.|Ha-ha.
{6159}{6239}- SheIIey's the onIy one|that didn't get out.|- Good. I'II tend to SheIIey.
{6240}{6303}You students take care of this.|Excuse me.
{6305}{6385}HeIIo, SheIIey. How are you today,|my IittIe powder puff?
{6387}{6447}Yeah. Yeah.
{6448}{6495}- Sir?
{6496}{6563}You may want to Iook at|the Iatest test resuIts.
{6564}{6647}I'm not sure if I'm|reading them correctIy.
{6648}{6746}- She's Iost three ounces|since the Iast feed?|- Must be some kind of mistake.
{6795}{6881}No, no, Jason.|Her entire moIecuIar structure|has been reaIigned.
{6919}{6997}We've done it.|This new formuIa's working.
{6999}{7045}It's actuaIIy reconstructed|SheIIey's DNA.
{7047}{7122}She Iost 20 percent|of her body fat in one feeding.
{7123}{7170}What if we upped the dosage?
{7171}{7255}No, one step at a time.|We don't want to jeopardize SheIIey.
{7257}{7303}- We'II keep the feedings as scheduIed.|- Okay.
{7305}{7351}ScheduIe. Excuse me.|I'm very Iate.
{7353}{7447}Students, we got a Iot of work to do|and don't have much time to do it in.
{7449}{7543}Tryin' to win a grant here.|So, as Arsenio used to say,|Iet's get busy!
{8043}{8119}- Comfy?|- Quite.
{8121}{8205}Anything I can get for you?|Juice? Coffee? Rack of Iamb?
{8207}{8253}No, sir, I'm fine.
{8484}{8555}You, uh, did want to see me|about something, didn't you, sir?
{8556}{8615}WeII, Professor KIump,
{8616}{8699}aIIow me to answer that question|by posing another.
{8701}{8778}- Why are you trying|to destroy my schooI?|- Beg your pardon, sir?
{8779}{8887}- Do you know who|Louise Vindovik is?|- Oh, sureIy, sir.
{8889}{8966}She's a IoveIy woman who so|generousIy donates money to heIp|fund our science department.
{8967}{9014}Ooh! CIose.|Very cIose. But wrong.
{9015}{9138}See, she was a IoveIy woman, and she|used to fund our science department.
{9139}{9210}That was before she was hospitaIized|for nearIy swaIIowing a gerbiI.
{9211}{9258}Not gerbiI, sir.|A hamster.
{9259}{9342}GerbiIs are more streamIined and|hamsters have a tendency to be fIuffier.
{9343}{9414}The maIe hamster's scrotum has|a tendency to be disproportionateIy-
{9415}{9470}Never mind.
{9471}{9518}Those NationaI RifIe peopIe|are right.
{9519}{9590}If I had one now- bang.
{9591}{9647}Sir, I'd Iike to concentrate|on the positives.
{9648}{9719}What Ms. Vindovik witnessed|was 5,000 heaIthy hamsters...
{9720}{9782}bred from a geneticaIIy deficient|hereditary Iine.
{9783}{9830}It's actuaIIy very exciting.
{9831}{9878}Do I Iook excited, KIump?
{9879}{9938}Uh, no, you don't|Iook excited at aII.
{9939}{10010}But maybe you might be hoIding it in,|your excitement,
{10011}{10079}not wanting to...|express it.
{10080}{10171}Now Iisten to me carefuIIy,|you fat tub of goo.
{10173}{10295}For years you've singIe-handedIy|aIienated every weaIthy donor we've had.
{10297}{10355}Air-conditioning schooIs|are outdrawing us!
{10356}{10420}We've Iost so much money,|red is our schooI coIor.
{10422}{10495}Inner-city schooIs|have better computers than we do.
{10496}{10550}Bosnia wants to give us money!
{10551}{10652}I'm going to set up a meeting|with HarIan HartIey- KIump!|Are you Iistening?
{10654}{10738}- Uh, yes, sir. Yes.|- HartIey is the Iast|rich aIumnus we've got.
{10739}{10798}And he's a science fan.
{10799}{10893}And he's considering donating|a $10 miIIion grant to this schooI.
{10895}{10965}And I want that money, KIump.
{10967}{11013}Your job depends upon it.
{11015}{11091}I'II Iet you know how to handIe it,|since I'II be watching you. Now go.
{11093}{11151}- But, sir, I don't know|if you shouId-|- Ah-ah-ah.
{11153}{11242}See, right back there, just before|you said, ""But, sir-"" Right there?
{11267}{11320}That was the end|of the meeting.
{11322}{11368}WeII, I guess|I'II Ieave.
{11370}{11416}You have a pIeasant day.
{11909}{11974}Grace, the cream|has turned again.
{12099}{12209}Of aII the equations you'II Iearn|during the course of your studies here,
{12211}{12306}this equation shaII be,|I promise you,
{12307}{12390}the most heIpfuI throughout|the course of your studies,
{12391}{12486}because this equation|fundamentaIIy breaks down...
{12487}{12599}what DNA is composed of...
{12600}{12647}and what components of DNA-
{12702}{12775}- I seem to have messed myseIf.
{12777}{12864}I haven't reaIIy messed myseIf.|I mean, I messed my shirt up.
{12926}{13011}But, uh, make sure you read chapter four|in your textbooks on genetics.

{55844}{55920}""Sherman, no matter what,|you've got to strut.

{77330}{77400}You caught me in the middIe|of an experiment I was doing.
{77402}{77505}I was trying to see how|the students wouId respond to|a teacher-Iess environment.
{77507}{77581}Teacher-Iess environment.|New fieId of research for you?
{77583}{77641}- Uh, yes, sir.|- Interesting. AIways thinking.
{77643}{77746}That's good, KIump.|Let me know your resuIts.|WouId you mind expIaining this?
{77786}{77878}Oh! Yeah, weII, um,|my car's in the shop, so-
{77879}{77983}So you put a $47,000 Iuxury car|on your facuIty account.
{77985}{78090}InitiaIIy, I- I requested a Yugo,|and this is aII they had.
{78091}{78138}If it's aII they had,|it's aII they had.
{78139}{78228}After aII, men Iike us|can't waIk around now, can we? Hmm?
{78230}{78276}Come on.
{78327}{78403}Oh, weII, weII. I'm gIad|you're takin' it Iike that, sir.
{78404}{78472}I thought you was gonna get|angry and start screamin'...
{78474}{78531}and hoIIerin',|and maybe even fire me.
{78532}{78581}Whoo!
{78583}{78677}Oh, Sherman, Sherman. In the end|we know so IittIe of each other, hmm?
{78679}{78730}No, my friend, I've got|bigger fish to fry.
{78731}{78782}I spoke to HarIan HartIey.
{78783}{78859}He's offering that tiny trinket that|couId save your entire research program.
{78861}{78938}- Oh, yes. AbsoIuteIy.|- I set up a meeting with him.
{78939}{79038}He wants to hear your grant|proposaI personaIIy- Friday,|the Ritz, dinner, 8:00 sharp.
{79039}{79131}WeII, sir, I think that's|a wonderfuI idea, sir. AbsoIuteIy.
{79133}{79209}- And I promise you,|I wiII not Iet you down.|- I know you won't.
{79211}{79269}I know you're going to be there,|and you're going to be great.
{79271}{79336}- In fact, I know you're|going to be perfect.
{79338}{79391}- Do you know how I know?|- How's that?
{79392}{79507}'Cause if you're not perfect,|never mind the yeIIing and|the screaming and the firing.
{79508}{79558}If anything goes wrong|for any reason,
{79559}{79619}I'm going to kiII you.
{79620}{79700}I don't mean that as a euphemism.|I'm going to IiteraIIy kiII you.
{79702}{79807}I'm going to strangIe you|and choke off your air suppIy...
{79808}{79859}untiI you pass away.
{79887}{79956}Ooh, okay.
{79958}{80028}'TiI Friday, then.
{80030}{80096}It's a date.
{80253}{80304}Sir, this is incredibIe.
{80305}{80376}It's- It's a compIete|metaboIic transformation.|How did it happen?
{80377}{80476}- Was it an accident?|- No, I did it to myseIf, Jason.
{80477}{80524}You did? Why?
{80525}{80632}If it was for the grant,|the data with SheIIey|was aIready so compeIIing.
{80633}{80717}WeII, I have compeIIing|reasons of my own, Jason.
{80718}{80796}I have a case of infatuation|of sorts with Miss Purty.
{80797}{80890}Professor, if you feeI this way|about CarIa, why don't you teII her?
{80892}{80950}It'd be a Iot simpIer|than transforming into-
{80952}{81019}This guy's testosterone IeveIs|are right off the charts.
{81021}{81088}He was mean Iast night.|It was so unIike you.
{81089}{81168}- You know, I did feeI that.|- Sir, you can't controI him.
{81169}{81258}Jason, you have no idea|what it feeIs Iike to be Buddy Love.
{81260}{81324}It's indescribabIe.|It's just wonderfuI!
{81325}{81408}The way peopIe taIk to him and|treat him, and the way she Iooks at him.
{81409}{81477}But he's dangerous.|He aImost kiIIed us Iast night.
{81478}{81565}We shouId be concentrating on getting|the grant proposaI to HarIan HartIey.
{81566}{81613}This is nuts!
{81666}{81761}I guess you're right, Jason.|I never have behaved Iike this before.
{81818}{81901}But on the other hand,
{81902}{81976}I've never been in Iove before.
{81977}{82024}Ever.
{82475}{82539}- Afternoon, CarIa.|- Hi, Sherman.
{82541}{82609}- How are you doing today?|- Pretty good.
{82611}{82678}I come over to see how things|were going with you and Buddy.
{82680}{82726}I wish I knew.
{82728}{82817}We went out Iast night. It was great.|We had such a wonderfuI time.
{82819}{82881}And then aII of a sudden|he runs out of the cIub.
{82883}{82929}He has some aIIergic reaction.
{82931}{82993}- I don't even know if he's aII right.|- He's fine.
{82995}{83073}He toId me that his Iip|sweIIed up, he put ice on it|and the sweIIing came down.
{83074}{83163}- Kinda strange, huh?|- WeII, did he even ask about me?
{83165}{83246}Did he say why he didn't caII me|and Iet me know he was aII right?
{83248}{83294}CarIa, Buddy's kind of unreIiabIe.
{83296}{83381}He's kind of what you caII|a ""here today, gone tomorrow""|kind of feIIow.
{83383}{83429}- Oh, I see.|- Mm-hmm.
{83431}{83523}So he had you taIk to me|because he's not interested anymore.
{83525}{83577}- No, it's nothing quite Iike that.|- Look.
{83579}{83655}I know what it feeIs Iike|to be brushed off, and it's okay.
{83657}{83760}This is aII my fauIt.|I shouId've never encouraged|you to go out with Buddy.
{83761}{83841}Sherman, you have been so sweet.
{83843}{83938}I'II just have to forget about him.|I'II see you Iater.
{83940}{84012}CarIa.
{84013}{84074}I was wonderin' if, uh,
{84076}{84145}I couId taIk to you|about you and I for a second.
{84147}{84193}I was-
{84233}{84306}I was wonderin' what|you were doin' Iater, 'cause...
{84308}{84357}the famiIy gonna get together.
{84358}{84409}She made a meaI and...
{84411}{84508}we gonna be eatin', so I figured if you|not doin' anything for dinner,
{84509}{84621}we'd Iove to have you,|if you want to come over for dinner.
{84623}{84677}We'd Iove to have you|over for dinner.
{84701}{84748}I'd Iove to.
{84749}{84809}- WouId you, now?|- Yes, I wouId.
{84811}{84862}ShouId we caII and make sure there's|going to be enough food?
{84864}{84945}I don't think that's|going to be a probIem.
{84954}{85025}- There's nothing|Iike being with famiIy!
{85026}{85084}I am hungry. Come on now.
{85085}{85158}- CarIa, where are you from?|- Chicago.
{85160}{85225}- Oh, Chicago!|We have famiIy there.|- Windy City, huh?
{85227}{85330}I was workin' on a skyscraper|in Chicago once and my Iunch|bIew off the 27th fIoor.
{85332}{85458}Yeah, I figure your fat ass|wouId remember somebody's|sandwich fIyin' off a buiIding.
{85460}{85517}- Oh, baby, eat some bread.
{85519}{85574}Miss Purty, are you and Sherman|havin' reIations?
{85576}{85654}- That's a good question.|- Uh, no, Grandma.
{85656}{85710}It's not Iike- Iike that.|We're coIIeagues.
{85712}{85761}- Oh.|- We just work together.
{85763}{85809}That's how it start out- coIIeagues.
{85811}{85857}Me and your grandfather|was coIIeagues.
{85859}{85929}Next thing you know he's on top of me|in the shed, pumpin' and a-sweatin'.
{85931}{85985}- It's not Iike that.|- WiII you hush up?
{85987}{86054}You never brought a girI home.|The Ieast you can do|is Iet us taIk to her.
{86056}{86120}Yeah, I'd Iike to get to know her|a IittIe better myseIf.
{86121}{86188}Ain't nothing wrong|with havin' reIations.|Don't be ashamed of that.
{86189}{86280}ReIations is beautifuI. When I was young|I used to aIways have reIations.
{86281}{86393}Every night, if a nice gentIeman|bring me fIowers and candy,
{86394}{86485}take me to a movie,|show me a IoveIy evenin',
{86486}{86585}then I wouId take him home|and give him hot, IoveIy reIations.
{86586}{86657}ReIations is a beautifuI thing.|It's nothing to be ashamed of.
{86658}{86713}EspeciaIIy two young peopIe.
{86715}{86780}- That bIowhoIe.|- CIetus!
{86781}{86872}- Sometimes when I'm aIone,|I reIate to myseIf.|- I can reIate.
{86873}{86969}- Oh, Mama.|- I don't wanna hear|this shit whiIe I'm eatin'.
{86971}{87030}- CIetus!|- I'm gonna kiII you Iater.
{87032}{87096}- CarIa, do you Iike chiIdren?|- Yes. Oh, that's wonderfuI.
{87097}{87168}I can't wait for Sherman|to bring me home some grandbabies.
{87169}{87261}I know you're gonna|enjoy making them babies.|Got those chiIdbearing hips.
{87263}{87325}- Baby'II pop right out.
{87326}{87393}Your famiIy got any money?|I ain't payin' for no big-ass wedding.
{87395}{87470}I know a wonderfuI minister.|What reIigious background are you?
{87472}{87569}I stiII got my wedding dress.|If you want it, I'II take it in.
{87570}{87652}You'd Iook so IoveIy in it.|It's white, though.
{87653}{87715}Can you wear a white wedding dress,|young Iady?
{87717}{87817}Now, Sherman,|you can wear a white tuxedo.
{87819}{87905}'Cause you know Sherman- Sherman|has never had reIations.
{87906}{87957}Mama, you gonna|embarrass my baby.
{87958}{88019}- I hope you got a strong back.|- Oh, Iook at my baby bIushin'.
{88021}{88111}When you get aII that man, and reIease|aII that that's been buiIt up...
{88113}{88177}for 35 years-
{88179}{88260}Just wantin' and wantin'|and wantin'!
{88261}{88321}Whoo! Might make|your head bIow off.
{88323}{88381}Pop goes the weaseI!
{88382}{88437}I got my own seIf hot|teIIin' that story.
{88438}{88501}Pop goes the weaseI,|'cause the weaseI say ""pop""!
{88502}{88549}You gonna get married|here or in Chicago?
{88550}{88617}Do you cook?|'Cause somebody's got to|feed my Sherman.
{88619}{88689}Yeah, I know a wonderfuI church|down there on Main Street,
{88690}{88737}but they won't marry you|if you're a Iesbian.
{88738}{88822}Not that I have anything|against Iesbians. I Iove Iesbians.
{88824}{88908}- Lesbians is cooI.|- There's nothing wrong|with a IittIe bingo.
{88909}{88956}A IittIe cunniIingus|ain't never hurt nobody.
{88957}{89036}- Why is it the woman aIways gets the|choice where they're gonna be married?|- Tradition.
{89037}{89130}Tradition, my ass! I ain't gonna pay|for everybody fIyin' to no Chicago!
{89132}{89188}- You know how much pIane tickets cost?|- You cheap bastard.
{89189}{89240}We're gonna have to|drive down there.
{89241}{89295}I'm not driving over to Chicago.
{89323}{89412}* Sherman gonna have reIations *
{89413}{89504}- My baby's not gettin' married-
{89505}{89600}There you go again, poppin' off gas|in front of this IoveIy young Iady.
{89601}{89653}We're trying to have a meaI.|Put that brake on this gas.
{89655}{89741}I hope your ass|turn into a frog.
{89742}{89802}- Don't nobody want to hear|your fIatuIence, CIetus KIump.
{89804}{89849}You're such a disgrace!
{89851}{89921}- I stopped hoIding my gas|a Iong time ago.|- You spoiIed the dinner!
{89922}{89982}- Say one more word-
{90032}{90104}- Listen, CarIa,
{90105}{90164}I want to apoIogize|about my famiIy back there.
{90165}{90274}- I think they got|the wrong idea about things.|- Oh, no. I shouId apoIogize.
{90276}{90336}I'm so sorry if I seemed|distant tonight.
{90337}{90403}I stiII have Buddy on my mind.
{90405}{90483}- You reaIIy care for Buddy, huh?|- I don't know.
{90485}{90595}I mean, on the outside,|he seems so cocky and brash.
{90597}{90685}But when I Iook in his eyes,|I see kindness, I see warmth.
{90687}{90751}And that's the side of Buddy|I wanted to get to know.
{90753}{90819}I just got way|ahead of myseIf.
{90821}{90911}And here I am, taIking your ear off|once again about Buddy.
{90913}{90961}No, it's quite aII right, reaIIy.
{90963}{91009}Listen, CarIa,
{91011}{91074}don't you worry about Buddy.
{91076}{91122}I'II find him for you.
{91157}{91209}Thank you, Sherman.
{91211}{91281}Thank you for being|such a good friend to me.
{91308}{91354}A good friend.
{91519}{91565}Good night.
{91567}{91613}Good night.
{92168}{92273}- Professor?
{92274}{92325}Is that you?
{92326}{92405}I just finished|the grant proposaI.
{92487}{92561}What's the matter with you? Never seen|a brother wearing a circus tent before?
{92563}{92650}- BIack man can't go campin'?|- Now, wait a minute.|You- You can't be you.
{92652}{92698}We agreed that|you wouIdn't do this.
{92700}{92757}Someone has to tend|to chunky butt's sex Iife.
{92759}{92825}Chunky butt is extremeIy horny.|Excuse me.
{92827}{92922}But Professor KIump|has a meeting tonight with|HarIan HartIey at the Ritz.
{92924}{93001}I'm gonna be at the Ritz|tonight, but it wiII not be|in the interest of science.
{93002}{93063}No! I can't Iet you go.
{93065}{93113}Professor!
{93115}{93213}If you're in there|and you can hear me, come out!
{93214}{93320}Professor, Iisten to me.|The testosterone IeveIs|are way too high.
{93321}{93393}- You can't controI him.
{93493}{93562}- Oh! Jason!|- What?
{93564}{93661}It's me, Sherman. I'm taIking to you|from deep down inside Buddy Love.
{93663}{93744}Listen to me cIoseIy. Go in|the back room whiIe I'm hoIding him...
{93745}{93821}- and get the coaguIant serum|off the back sheIf!|- In the storage cIoset?
{93822}{93884}- Yes, Jason! Hurry, Jason!|- I got it!
{93885}{93948}- We don't have much time. Let's move!|- I got it!
{94005}{94060}Professor!|Professor!
{94061}{94136}I have an appointment with Iove!|Good night, hamster boy!
{94137}{94197}- No, Professor!
{94712}{94792}""Sorry I haven't phoned,|but I haven't been myseIf IateIy.
{94793}{94854}""Join me for dinner. Buddy Love.
{94856}{94965}P.S. I've encIosed a waIIet-sized photo|for your enjoyment.''
{95173}{95240}Buddy, how can I stay mad at you?|This is gorgeous!
{95241}{95312}You're gorgeous and I'm gorgeous, so we|shouId be in gorgeous surroundings.
{95313}{95365}- Let me get the room key.|- Wait. HoId it.
{95366}{95425}I didn't say anything|about going to any room with you.
{95426}{95489}You said you were|taking me to dinner.
{95491}{95557}What are you taIking about?|Oh, you think that- Oh!
{95558}{95605}Oh, my- Hey, hey, hey.|SIow down.
{95606}{95670}I just want to spend|some time with you, by ourseIves.
{95672}{95769}I don't want to|share you with these peopIe.|I want to eat, aIone, quiet.
{95771}{95865}I wouId never disrespect you.|I'm a puppy dog.
{95866}{95937}PIease, can I go|get this room?
{95986}{96049}- Yes?|- Yes.
{96051}{96133}I'd throw him in the river|with a Buick tied to his neck.|He'd probabIy drag the car down.
{96134}{96181}- Miss Purty. Purty!|- Dean Richmond.
{96182}{96242}Have you seen Professor KIump?|He's 40 minutes Iate.
{96244}{96310}If HarIan HartIey waIks out that door,|$10 miIIion goes with him.
{96312}{96381}Oh, Lord. I'm gonna have to Iay down|in front of his car.
{96382}{96441}- Let's go.|- Buddy, you know Sherman's research.
{96442}{96502}He's Iate for a meeting.|FiII in for him.
{96504}{96581}No, it's a nice thought, but he'd|have to know Sherman's research.
{96583}{96633}You know Sherman's research?|Who are you?
{96635}{96720}You might say I'm a visiting professor|who might be staying for a whiIe.
{96721}{96796}- I do know Sherman's work.|In fact, I am Sherman's work.|- Buddy!
{96797}{96873}Do you think you can do KIump's job|and crowbar that dough out of HartIey?
{96875}{96957}There's not a job on this pIanet|I can't do twice as good as Sherman.
{96958}{97030}Good. FoIIow me.
{97032}{97093}I'II go do this just 'cause|you asked me, not 'cause of him.
{97094}{97144}You just stay put.
{97145}{97220}I've got to go be briIIiant.|Look at your fine seIf.
{97221}{97313}I bet you have on|a thong made of Iicorice, don't you?
{97314}{97357}Excuse me.
{97366}{97443}AII righty!
{97445}{97501}WeII, this had better be|Professor KIump.
{97502}{97565}KIump? That fraud,|that hack, that no-taIent.
{97566}{97635}No, sir, this is the man|behind KIump's work, the reaI genius.
{97637}{97683}I give you|Professor Buddy Love.
{97685}{97778}AII right, Professor Love. You have|one minute to show me your research.
{97780}{97876}No, you got it backwards, RockefeIIer.|You have one minute to Iisten.
{97877}{97929}May I borrow this?|You haven't used it, have you?
{97931}{98005}Don't want to get|your boogers on my fingers.|Okay. Here we go.
{98007}{98061}25N times C.
{98062}{98147}You have to excuse my handwriting.|I'm in a bit of a rush.
{98149}{98229}- You have a pIeasant evening.|Good night.|- Uh, Professor Love,
{98231}{98331}don't you think Mr. HartIey wouId Iike|to know what that means in Iay terms?
{98333}{98411}- Oh, you mean rich-dummy terms?
{98413}{98505}I'II break it down for the rich dummies|in the room. Listen up.
{98507}{98553}If you eat nasty stuff|Iike this-
{98555}{98625}I know it Iooks good,|and some of y'aII Iike pork chops,
{98627}{98742}but this greasy, nasty pork chop-|there's a gene in your D.N.A....
{98744}{98841}that routes this straight|to your fat ceIIs, and it|causes unsightIy conditions.
{98936}{99057}The arm is taking on a geIatin|sort of vibe. It's quite nasty.
{99058}{99121}To my Ieft, this gentIeman|has turkey neck.
{99123}{99186}To my immediate Ieft,|this woman is suffering|from what we Iike to caII...
{99188}{99234}""saddIebag syndrome.""
{99236}{99358}To my extreme Ieft,|this young Iady is suffering|from what I Iike to caII ""tank ass.""
{99360}{99442}PIease, sit down.|Not tonight. I'm your brother!
{99444}{99514}Like I was saying, everybody,|where there's a wiII, there's a way.
{99516}{99583}There is a way we can|turn these genes off.
{99585}{99653}I'm not taIking about|using exercise or diet.
{99654}{99716}I'm taIking about|by taking a simpIe soIution...

{99914}{99993}Or, in Iayman's terms,|an extremeIy tight, wonderfuI ass.
{99994}{100053}Let's give a big round of appIause|for the woman with the nice ass.
{100054}{100128}Her ass is so nice, don't you agree?|She's worked so hard.

{100329}{100401}- Where'd you find this man?|- HarIan, it's an outrage.
{100402}{100467}I assure you he has no affiIiation|with this schooI.
{100469}{100522}- He's briIIiant.|- ExactIy my point.
{100524}{100614}It's an outrage that his briIIiance|has no affiIiation with this schooI.

{100677}{100743}Attention.|Brought him to your attention.

{101156}{101221}You're good, Love. Very good.
{101223}{101332}How'd you Iike to fiII in|for Professor KIump|on a more permanent basis?

{115079}{115159}WeII, I must admit,|it didn't seem Iike the Sherman I knew.

- Great game, dad.
- Thank you, my boy.
My goodness, the game night was something special.
Even better, because you invited me.
It's like I am a part of the family.
Good night together.
- Good night, Roy.
- Good night, Uncle Roy.
Good night.
8th
It's bedtime for you kids.
Wait a moment.
Nobody goes here until we all hugged each other.
A hug? Dad, are you alright?
I feel great.
Every now and then you just realize how happy you are.
Come on.
- OK.
- Press, press.
This feels so good,
I do not want to let go.
But off to bed.
- Peck. Good night.
- Sorry.
- Good night.
- Bye.
You seem so to have a really good mood.
And why not?
My life is good.
I have faithful friends, three loving children
- and a beautiful woman.
- Earl.
What else can you wish for?
Well, it's Thursday night.
And also time for us, going to bed.
I'll be right back, my dear.
I only clear the game and the dishes on.
Only takes a minute.
I'm waiting for you.
Who would have thought that?
I had so much fun today,
I did not even watch TV.
I could look for a few minutes.
What can that harm?
And now back to the rich.
Stanley, I hold do not turn off the tension.
What did you buy for my birthday?
You already admire it the last 37 kilometers.
- The lambswool seat cover?
- No, silly.
This huge piece of unspoiled coastline.
That's all yours, my dear.
Happy Birthday.
- My own shoreline.
- Yes.
I am so happy.
I do not have my own coastal strip.
Welcome to
The lifestyle of those we envy.
And we all envy the super rich male model Clive!
We met Clive in his lush
50-room amusement palace.
In Movieland Hills,
while bathing in his jeweled
Whirlpool filled with champagne.
Sorry, you happen to have very expensive mustard?
I have nothing of what they have.
How could I think
I would be happy?
I should see it.
There is a huge hole in my life, that I can never fill.
Fill the hole in your life with the Willi cup, the old sea bear.
A collector mug from world famous manufacturer Fernhill.
You certainly expect a high price for such handmade artwork.
And you're right.
He's terribly expensive.
But can you really live without him?
- No.
- Then call now!
- I will.
- Please be patient,
while we review your credit rating.
Only a select few are suitable for ownership
this masterpiece in limited quantities.
- Name?
- Earl Sinclair.
Hi?
Do not miss your chance, to the chosen ones.
To associate mug lovers, who found true happiness.
I would do everything for such a Fernhill mug.
Everything! I would...
I would even sell my soul!
Sulfur. I have to stop smoking.
Honey I'm home.
You. You are him. You are...
You are the one on the
"Devilish good ham".
Not long. They get a copyright lawsuit.
What do you want from me?
I happened to pass by and listened to something.
I could you get such a cup.
If you want.
Are you kidding?
I would give my soul.
Yes, yes, I heard that.
Of course you are aware of the seriousness of this trade?
Yes. I trade my immortal soul against one of these cups in the TV.
You captured it.
Where do I sign?
On the dotted line, please, and please draw on the pages with the slips against.
That looks so intimidating.
A pure standard contract,
I assure you.
Maybe that should be checked by a lawyer.
I am the king of lawyers!
Just sign!
I'm sorry.
I did not want to get angry.
It was a busy evening.
Every time this lifestyle broadcast
I have a lot to do
It was my pleasure, to serve you, Mr. Sinclair.
See you later.
Thanks.
Hey, wait! Where is my mug?
If you are the lord of darkness can not trust who then?
Man, that went fast.
No freight costs.
FRAGILE
We met Earl in his fabulous showcase home, where he has his extraordinary
Fernhill mug demonstrated.
Yes. Earl really seems to have everything.
He is finally on his way, to be really happy.
Yes.
I have never seen such a thing.
You have to be the luckiest person to be on earth.
My goodness. I wish I was you.
Of course I would have to to change my clothes
Would not be worthwhile.
But that is still a great-looking mug.
Yes, people.
Do you beat "luck" in the dictionary,
Do you see how I feel?
Yes.
Sinclair! Come in immediately!
What's the point, Sinclair?
I only give with mine new mug on.
Who said you can have such a thing?
If I'm not mistaken, sir, may I own things.
Well, I can not refuse you.
By legal means.
But we from the
Have a mug lover company strict standards for those who collect
Own or want to show cups.
You own a Fernhill mug?
A? I have eight!
Eight cups?
Sir, you have to be extremely happy.
I am the happiest you will ever meet
You worthless bucket full of fish food.
You can tell by her cheerful mood.
Flap!
Do you want to be a mug owner, you should behave like that too.
How do I start, sir?
First, keep away from the rabble far away, with which you spend time.
You mean my friends?
No more friends, Sinclair.
They are without cups and therefore not even worth the contempt.
Keep an eye on them, because they will be jealous and maybe you want to steal your mug.
Thanks for the warning.
Then you have to join our mug company.
Here.
Membership fee is 1,200 a year.
What? 1,200 dollars?
An alms, considering the hours great mug fellowship considering.
- We'll meet next week.
- I am invited to you?
Yes. While we light refreshments take, replace cup legends.
Buy, sell and trade and discuss articles in the mug magazine.
Cup magazine?
The monthly overview of Beverage Tube Collecting.
You have to subscribe.
But a bargain with 200 a year.
Sir, may I go now?
It seems, as if I had to spend a lot.
Yes.
Make room, he comes in.
What on earth is this?
- A Fernhill mug showcase.
- He looks expensive.
A necessary issue, to protect our investment.
- What investment?
- Our Fernhill mug.
Do you know that mug like mine have risen in value around...
My mug! Where is he!
Did you break it,
I'll tear your limbs out.
I did not touch him.
Earl, stop it.
Nobody broke anything.
After you left,
Roy came by and wanted to borrow him.
You owe me an apology.
Roy borrowed my mug?
Yes. He said, he wanted to impress a date with it.
You lent him to Roy?
He is rabble.
Mr. Richfield was right.
And now Willi is sitting in Roys shabby, small dump, while Roy and a cheap slut drooling on him and him in hers holding greasy little fingers.
Hi, Uncle Roy.
I have no greasy fingers.
The drool problem of my girlfriend is largely regulated.
- Here's your stupid mug.
- Woe, he's not okay.
We just looked at him.
And you have diminished its value.
What does this mean?
That collectible artwork like this not ignorant scum how you should be touched.
Earl, it's just a cup.
Do not be ridiculous, Fran.
You sound as stupid as Roy.
- What did you say?
- Fran, do not listen to him.
You are never as stupid as...
You can not talk to me or her talk about me like that.
I'm leaving, Mr. Former Old Boy.
And never come again.
- Bye.
- Finally got rid of.
You see mug TV.
Programs exclusively by, for, and about mug lovers.
And now the mug messages with chip stone.
Good evening.
Panic shook again tonight the mug community,
as another, more meaningless
Mug theft was reported.
The police advise all bucket owners,
their priceless collectibles good guard.
More Mug News in a minute.
Just courage.
And this activates the system.
You activate with your code
Alarm and security apparatus.
That's what keeps the thieves from to get my cup in her paws?
You mean, like that?
Do you see that?
And so disable it.
Yes. What do you say, Mr. S?
- Is it worth the money?
- Every last dollar.
We needed too.
Earl, we have to talk.
I was in the supermarket right now and they did not accept my check.
Something with insufficient coverage.
Fran, expensive alarm systems do not grow on trees.
I had to take the money somewhere.
Best of our bank account.
- What?
- Want to hear a cool alarm?
I want to know, how we should eat without money.
No fear.
We just earn something.
Mom, all my clothes has disappeared!
My sweaters, my blouses, my shoes. Everything.
My guitar is gone and my speakers.
Great alarm system, Earl.
Calm down all.
I know exactly where your stuff is.
I wanted anyway to check if everything is fine.
FLEA MARKET
Could you agree with the price go down this guitar?
No action. Prices as written.
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Yes.
What does the baby chair cost?
He is not for sale.
Sixty dollars.
- The chair is not for sale.
- My goodness.
I give you two dollars for the blouse.
Listen, there is no flea market.
- You never would have...
- Pull yourself together, Fran.
Look how I deserve.
You're acting like a madman and destroy our family.
Are you kidding?
We earn extra money, only by being useless,
Declutter forgotten goods.
- These are my textbooks.
- My diary!
Come now.
We have to bring all sacrifices,
Let's stay a Fernhill family.
The cup!
The awful mug is the root of all the chaos.
You're in luck, you have an alarm system, otherwise I would run in and beat him down.
Fran. This mug, as you call it, made us happier than ever.
You're just too angry to see that.
Fran! Fran!
Bad mug.
Its getting late. Time to sleep.
Good night, Willi.
- We are up, you should need us.
- Of course, Mr. S.
CUP SECURITY ABSTRACT
Dino baby powder
Caught.
Wake up!
- What happened?
- Something is going on.
I'm here for you, Mr. S.
My goodness. It is the baby!
It was not me, I tell you.
If you do something to the cup, so help me...
Earl. Take action against the noise!
Immediately, ma'am.
OK.
- Honey, are you alright?
- I'm fine, mom.
Give me the cup.
You little rat.
I should you Skinning alive.
- Looks like the work of insiders.
- It's ok, hank.
He was it. Lock him up and throw the key away.
Earl, this is our child.
Okay, keep the key.
Mr. S., will you file a claim?
Not necessary.
- I take the child with me.
- Can you have him.
More precisely, we will all go, until my husband comes to his senses again.
- Yes.
- All right, go.
Take the children with you.
The types in the lifestyle series marry constantly new!
But they keep their villas and sports cars and Fernhills.
Who is this?
Nobody gets my cup.
I'm here, to protect him. Nobody.
Nobody...
They are all after me.
They are after me.
Tomorrow, Mr. S. Another quiet night?
You can sleep peacefully, the cup is still safe.
That's true. That's the important thing.
Until this evening.
It was here last night really quiet, right?
Yes, sir.
And our alarm system did her job, right?
Sir, if it does not bother you,
I really want to be with my family.
You have a family?
Yes, sir. Wife and children.
Do you have pictures?
Yes, many pictures.
I bet they still like you.
Yes, I think I am the happiest person in the world.
- Yes.
- I do not have much, but I have her love.
In my view that is enough to be happy.
I have a picture of my mug.
Loopy.
I lost my friends,
I lost my family.
I even lost Hank.
I'm sorry, Willi, but I am not happy.
Sulfur. Pooh.
Ok, Sinclair. Ready to take off?
What does this mean? I'm not dead.
Why are you hanging around?
For this exciting fun?
No, I think,
I made a terrible mistake.
I've never heard that before.
I'm not ready to go.
I made a mistake.
Well, forget it. We have a deal.
Pretty expensive.
You cost me everything.
Can I take this?
Sure, a carry-on bag is allowed.
Why do you want the cup?
As a constant painful memory the stupidity of my actions.
I like it. TrÃ¨s symbolic.
I'll just get the box quickly.
He should on the crossing nothing happens.
Good, but hurry up.
I have a lot to do.
- What's this?
- Are you finally going now?
A moment.
- Here is a manufacturer's warranty.
- I beg your pardon?
A legal document that says if I am not completely satisfied, I can return the cup for up to seven working days send and get everything refunded.
Let me see that.
Let's see... That's a guarantee...
Seven days?
Full refund?
Damn it.
I am not satisfied.
I want to have my family back.
You are me this time jumped off the shovel, Sinclair.
Everything that was done was not done.
Bye for now!
Hey, wait a minute. What is...
We met Clive in his lush
50-room amusement palace.
In Movieland Hills,
while bathing in his jeweled
Whirlpool filled with champagne.
Earl, are you going to bed?
Sweetheart, Thursday night, you know what?
- You're right, that's it.
- Exactly.
It still is Thursday evening and I do not have
Family and friends scorned, because of a ridiculous piece of property.
No, Earl, you do not have.
Do not go away.
We'll be right back.
With much more to envy, after these dazzling commercials.
No, not really.
I'm coming, darling.
Don't worry. It's just a pack of wolves.
Come on. We're almost rid of it.
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!
Run! Run!
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.
Come on. Help me bury it.
What if someone digs it up?
May God have mercy on his soul.
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.
- Good afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.
Get him!
Prepare to die, Parrish!
Hey, Parrish, what's the rush?
He's goin' to his dad's factory!
Alan wants his daddy now!
Go ahead, Parrish.
Run to Daddy. We'll be waiting.
- Hi, Carl.
- Hey, Alan, I gotta show you something.
Come here. Now, I've been working on this for almost a year.
I got an appointment this afternoon with your father to show him this.
Go ahead. Take it.
So what do ya think?
Ya think he'II like it?
- What is it?
- What is it?
Man, this is the future. If I can get Wilt Chamberlain to wear 'em...
I predict there'll be a pair of those in every closet in America.
That's gonna be the height of fashion.
What's wrong?
- Nothin'.
- Alan!
Thanks, Bob.
What are you doing here?
I've told you before. This factory isn't a playground. It's dangerous.
- Dad, can I have a ride home?
- Look, Alan.
Is Billy Jessup picking on you again?
Son, you're gonna have to face him sooner or later.
Look, if you're afraid of something, you've got to stand and face it.
Now, run on, son.
Carl, you should know better than to let the boy play in here.
Sorry, sir.
- What was it you wanted to show me?
- Just a minute, sir.
What the devil...
Get an extinguisher.
Who did this?
Well?
I did, sir.
Just because you're a Parrish doesn't mean you can hang around my girlfriend.
- We're just friends.
- Not anymore. Get him!
- Let's go!
- Okay, I've got his bike.
Jerks!
Wow.
Neat.
Alan. Are you home?
Oh, Alan, not again.
Come on.
Hard work, determination, a cheerful outlook... attributes that have exemplified the Brantford spirit... since our forefathers first settled this town.
Despite the harshness of our native clime and the granite of our soil...
- we have...
- Prospered.
- I knew the damn thing this morning.
- You'll know the darn thing tonight.
- All right. Let's go.
- Sam. We have to talk to Alan.
- Well, we're on our way.
- Okay.
I told your father what you told me this afternoon. It wasn't just Billy Jessup.
Look, if I'd known that,
Alan, I wouldn't have...
- It's okay, Dad.
- I want you to know I am proud of you.
I mean, you faced them, even though you were outnumbered.
And since you took it like a man... your mother and I have decided that you're ready to go... to the Cliffside School for Boys.
- There.
- Congratulations, sweetheart.
- You don't want me living here anymore?
- Alan.
It's always been the plan that you go to Cliffside when you were ready.
I mean, Parrishes have been going to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.
Even your Uncle Skylar went there.
- Look at this. Parrish Hall.
- It's the main dormitory.
Oh, this is great. Kids are on my case here because I'm a Parrish.
Just wait till I'm living in a building named after me.
It was named after my father.
- Good. Why don't you live in it?
- I did!
I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for my years there.
Maybe I don't wanna be who you are.
Maybe I don't wanna be a Parrish.
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.
Get your coat!
I guess I'm not ready for Cliffside then!
We're taking you there next Sunday! I don't wanna hear another word about it!
You won't.
I'm never talking to you again!
- Sam...
- Don't!
- Sam...
- What?
Nothing. Just...
- What are you doing here?
- I brought your bike back.
You didn't have to. I was going over to Billy's to get it myself.
I told Billy to stop picking on you.
You shouldn't have wasted your breath.
We'll talk about this some other time.
What was that?
- You heard it too?
- Of course I heard it.
Come on. I found this weird game in the factory.
A game?
"Jumanji.
A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind.
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.
And the first player to reach the end wins." You wanna play?
I quit playing board games five years ago.
Sarah.
- It's gotta be magnetized or something.
- Alan, look.
"At night they fly, you better run... these winged things are not much fun."
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- Put it away, Alan!
- Okay.
Oh, no.
The game thinks I rolled.
What do you mean,
"The game thinks"?
"In the jungle you must wait... until the dice read five or eight."
"In the jungle you must wait..."
What's that mean?
Roll the dice!
I think a bed-and-breakfast is just what this town needs.
Well, it's pretty hard to pass up, especially full of furniture.
Oh, boy! I keep forgetting how big this place is.
Judy, Peter, come look at this.
I'm gonna put a reception area over here.
And a bar over here in the parlor.
That sounds lovely. I'm sure you and your kids are gonna be very happy here.
Oh. Well, actually, they're my late brother's.
He and his wife passed away just last winter.
Is this something, or what?
It sure is.
So, what do you think, young man?
Is it big enough for you?
Peter hasn't spoken a word since it happened.
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribly awful.
It's okay.
We barely even knew our parents.
They were always away... skiing in
Saint Moritz, gambling in Monte Carlo... safariing in darkest Africa.
We didn't even know if they loved us.
But when the sheik's yacht went down, well... they managed to write us a really beautiful good-bye note... that was found floating in a champagne bottle amongst the debris.
Excuse me.
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.
- So you'll send me those escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.
I'll have to get a locksmith out for this one.
Peter, pick up your toys, please.
Peter, take this suitcase up to the attic.
Then we can all have ice cream and bourbon.
What? What is it?
- I'm going to Motel 6.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
I don't see any guano.
- He said it looked like that.
- That's an African bat.
Some kid said she saw a bunch of those back in the '60s.
But we don't get bats like that in New England.
- But that's what he saw.
- Well, whatever it was... is gone now.
Bats aren't what I'd worry about in this house anyways.
What would you worry about?
Well, personally...
I wouldn't wanna live in a house where someone was murdered.
- Murdered?
- Yep.
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.
There's a thousand and one places he could have hid the body in this house.
Especially if he chopped it up first.
Hey, up there! You kids don't wanna be late for your first day of school.
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Ya hear that?
There is nothing to be afraid of in this house.
I can't believe I have to see your principal after the first day.
What am I gonna do?
Let's just try to relax and finish our dinner and talk about something else.
Well, we found out why you got this house so cheap.
Twenty-six years ago, a kid named
Alan Parrish used to live here.
Then one day, he just disappeared...
'cause his parents chopped him up in little pieces and hid him in the walls.
Okay, that's it. I am sick and tired of your lies, young lady. You're grounded.
Fine. There's nowhere to go in this stupid town anyway.
And just for your information, that wasn't a lie.
Did you hear anything a little while ago?
Do you miss Mom and Dad?
- No.
- Liar.
If you don't cut that out, they're gonna send you to a shrink.
Where do you think they're gonna send you if you don't start talking?
If I get held up at the permit office,
I'll give you a call.
School bus should be here any minute.
You guys still have your house keys?
You guys listening to me?
Hello?
- Hello?
- What?
Maybe I should wait with you till the bus comes.
Did your parents used to put you on the bus?
- No. No.
- Are you sure?
I could drop you off.
No, don't worry about us.
The bus'll be here any minute.
Okay.
Please be good today.
- You do hear it.
- Hear what?
Where's it coming from?
Wow.
Let's bring it over here.
Weird. They're stuck.
"Jumanji. A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind.
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles get another turn.
The first player to reach the end wins."
It's gotta be microchips or something.
You go first.
Okay.
Six.
"A tiny bite can make you itch, make you sneeze, make you twitch."
Don't!
"This will not be an easy mission... monkeys slow the expedition."
What is that?
I bet those monkeys came from the game.
The mosquitoes too.
Uh-oh.
I didn't see this part.
"Adventurers beware."
"Adventurers beware. Do not begin unless you intend to finish.
The exciting consequences of the game will vanish... only when a player has reached
Jumanji and called out its name."
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.
- Put it away.
- Wait!
The instructions say if we finish the game, it'll all go away.
We better do it, or Aunt Nora's gonna pitch a fit.
We should just get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.
No, you rolled doubles.
You get another turn.
Roll!
Five.
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.
Your party better move poste haste."
I don't like the sound of that.
Judy, someone's in here.
It's not real, Peter.
It's a hallucination.
Run, Peter!
I'm back.
Somebody roll a five or an eight?
He did.
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you.
Sorry if I scared you.
Sorry if I scared you.
Thank you.
I'm back! Mom! Dad!
I'm home!
I'm back!
It's me!
It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!
I'm home! I'm back.
Are you my little sister?
No.
I'm Judy and he's Peter.
Where's Mom?
Is Dad at the factory?
Are you Alan Parrish?
Yeah.
Who are you?
We live here now.
- Where's my mom and dad?
- We don't know.
This house has been empty for years.
Everyone thought you were dead.
Sorry.
- Gimme that description again.
- I said, red fur and long fail.
Get down off of my car, please.
And get up on the sidewalk.
- What year is it?
- It was brand new.
No.
What year is it?
- Uh, 1995, remember?
You got some I. D? Oh, let me guess.
You left it in your other Tarzan outfit?
- Twenty-six years.
- Are you from around here?
I was!
But I've been in Jumanji.
Indonesia.
He was in the Peace Corps.
Bentley.
- Carl Bentley, the Soleman.
- Is this man related to you?
- Yes, sir. He's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?
Well, yeah, he's a vegetarian.
Get out of there!
Monkeys! Monkeys.
Is he all right upstairs?
Uh, he suffered a head injury a few months ago.
Hey! Hey... What?
Don't you move!
Freeze! Hey!
Don't move. Don't move.
- Wait a minute! Where are you going?
- To find my parents!
Come on.
Wait!
My dad used to make shoes here.
They were the best shoes in New England.
Hey!
Sorry.
Easy, girl.
Do you know what happened to this shoe factory?
Yeah, it folded up, like everything else in this town.
Hey, it's pretty cold out there.
How 'bout some coffee?
Why would they close
Parrish Shoes?
When his kid ran away, Sam put all he had into trying to find him.
His time, his money.
Everything.
After a while, he stopped comin' to work.
He just quit carin'.
I don't think anybody loved his boy more than Sam did.
Here.
You're gonna freeze out there.
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?
- I see 'em now and then.
- Yeah?
They're over on Adams Street.
Our parents are dead too.
They were in the Middle East negotiating peace when...
Our dad was in advertising.
I bet you miss him, huh?
Me too.
There he goes again.
Listen, I know you're upset and all, but
I kinda feel we should finish the game.
We?
Why do you need me?
Just in case any other scary stuff comes out.
Plus, there's a lion in my aunt's bedroom. What should I do about that?
- Do I look like a Ringling Brother?
- But she'll be home soon.
Won't she be surprised.
Hope she's not allergic to cats.
Larry, we need the wheels.
Gimme a hand.
Did we hit her that hard?
No, it looks like another one of those weird bites.
It's another one.
Geez, that's over 50.
What the hell's goin' on?
Easy now.
- Hey, look. Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?
- The realtor.
- Quiet. Listen.
You hear that?
- Hear what?
- Get in the car.
Okay, think.
What came out of the game before me?
- There was a lion, a bunch of monkeys...
- That!
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a bug.
But we're safe in here.
See? We're fine.
As long as we stay low, he can't get through there too far. Don't worry.
We're fine.
Hey, he can't get us in here.
He can't get through the glass.
We're safe.
Either one of you know how to drive?
No? Well, that's no problem.
Well, my dad used to let me back the car down the driveway once.
- So what's the big deal?
- Buckle up.
Here we go!
Oh, wait a minute.
What... Wait.
Alan, the top!
Piece of cake.
Yeah.
Keep that thing away from me!
When are you gonna help us play?
We've gotta hurry.
Our aunt's gonna be home soon.
Well, good. You can inform her that she's the ex-owner of this house.
I hope you realize, with my parents gone, this home belongs to me.
Oh, thank you.
No more banana leaves.
What do you think those monkeys are gonna do to the ecosystem around here?
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
- A tale of a fateful trip
- Hello!
That started out on this tropic port aboard this tiny ship
The mate was a mighty sailor man
The skipper brave and sure
Five passengers set sail that day for a three-hour four
What happened to you?
You shave with a piece of glass?
What happened to you?
The Clampetts have a yard sale?
What do you want?
I've never shaved before.
Where are you going?
How 'bout Peter and I play, and you just sort of watch?
No, thanks.
I've seen it.
So if you're not gonna help us, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.
I wonder if Mrs. Nedermeyer's still teaching sixth grade.
Come on, Judy.
He's not gonna help us. He's afraid.
What did you say?
You're afraid.
It's okay to be afraid.
Let's go set it up in the living room.
No, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
Whatever it is, we'll handle it by ourselves. We don't need your help.
I don't think so.
You think monkeys, mosquitoes and lions are bad?
That's just the beginning.
I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares.
Things you can't even imagine.
Things you can't even see.
There are things that'll hunt you in the night.
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eat.
And you hope to God that you're not dessert.
Afraid?
You don't even know what afraid is.
You will not last five minutes without me.
So are you gonna help us?
I'll watch.
But I'm not afraid.
Peter, that was very cool.
That's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Alan, ready?
There is no "ready."
I'll try it again.
It's not working.
Oh, no. It's not your turn.
Yeah. I rolled first... and then Peter twice 'cause he got doubles, and now it's my turn again.
No, look. Two of those pieces are yours, right?
Whose are the other pieces?
The elephant was mine.
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.
I'm gonna have to play.
It's not my turn.
Whose turn is it?
Sarah Whittle.
This is where she used to live.
This place gives me the creeps.
We used to play on this porch.
I knew she still wouldn't live here.
Probably married Billy Jessup and they're living in a trailer park.
- Let's go.
- Maybe she'II know where Sarah went.
Of course she'll know where Sarah went.
She's a psychic.
Good point.
- I remember the porch being bigger.
- Hello?
- Um, can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?
No, we're just trying to find someone.
- Madam Serena can't see you right now.
- Maybe you can help us.
What is it?
We're looking for someone who used to live here.
No, I've lived here my whole life.
Well, then you must know
Sarah Whittle.
What do you want with Sarah Whittle?
No, I don't go by that name anymore.
What do you want?
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game with a little boy down the street.
A game with drums.
How do you know that?
I was that little boy,
Sarah.
You killed her.
Leave a message and the docfor will call you back...
at his earliest convenience.
Dr. Boorstein.
Sarah Whittle calling.
If you could call me back as soon as you can...
I think I need to have my dosage checked.
That event we've been discussing for a long time now... the one that didn't really happen...
I'm havin' an episode here with the little boy that didn't really disappear.
I'm sittin' in his living room drinkin' lemonade.
If you could call me, I'd really be interested in your interpretation.
Thank you so much. He'II call me back ten minutes before the hour.
- While we're waiting...
- Whoa, God!
- Sarah!
- No, no, no, no!
- Sarah, please!
- I spent over 2,000 hours in therapy... convincing myself that that doesn't exist.
What happened to you was so awful,
I made up that whole thing.
- Sarah, it was awful. It really was.
- Am I crazy?
It was real. Real.
No, no, no.
It wasn't real.
Your father murdered you and chopped you up in little pieces.
Sarah, come on.
My dad did that?
My father could barely hug me... let alone cut me into little pieces.
Twenty-six years ago... we started playing a little game.
And now we're all gonna sit down... and we're gonna finish it.
And guess what?
Your turn.
No!
Play the game.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- All right.
Just gimme the dice and you can go home.
You don't have to play.
Thank you, Alan.
Oh, my God!
How could you do that?
It's the law of the jungle, Sarah.
You'll get used to it.
And I think of all the energy I spent visualizing you as a radiant spirit.
Go on, read it.
"They grow much faster than bamboo.
Take care or they'll come after you."
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening.
Oh, it is.
Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.
No quick movements.
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- Oh, yeah, they're beautiful.
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.
And definitely stay away from the pods.
The big yellow ones.
What big yellow ones?
Peter!
I got ya!
Get his arms!
Get it off me!
Oh, my God!
- Hang on, boy.
- Grab him!
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, my God!
Sorry, Angus.
Whoa. Harvest time!
Are you okay?
Oh, my God!
My car.
Oh, my car.
Has anybody seen Carl?
- I can't believe this. Start. Please.
- Carl, come in please.
- Carl here.
- Where have you been?
We've got a serious animal control situation.
You gotta get Stan and Willy on it.
I'm headin' to the old Parrish place... to check a suspicious character.
I should've been a fireman.
Get your hands off me!
- The game is not over yet, Sarah.
- It is for me.
You are not in the jungle anymore. Stop this! You don't treat people like this.
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.
Alan, please. Last time I played this game, it ruined my life.
It ruined your life?
"In the jungle you must wait, till the dice read five or eight."
I was a little girl, Alan.
You disappeared.
And a bunch of bats surrounded me and chased me down the street.
I was afraid.
I'm sorry, Alan.
No one believed me.
I was all alone.
So was I.
For 26 years, Sarah.
Me too.
It's okay, Sarah.
We're scared too.
But if we finish the game, it'll all go away.
- What if I get stuck in the game?
- You won't.
Because I won't stop playing.
- And neither will I.
- I won't either.
- Come on, Sarah.
- Please?
I knew this was gonna be a bad day.
Hey, come on.
We'II be fine.
We just have to keep our heads.
Roll with the punches.
"A hunter from the darkest wild... makes you feel just like a child."
- What is it?
- Van Pelt.
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.
Coming, ready or not.
Hey, you!
Drop your gun and get your hands in the air!
Man, I don't believe this.
Even if Alan gets out of this, the same kind of thing's... gonna happen over and over again.
When you carry around so much anger, it attracts a lot of negative energy.
And things happen, like ending up in the jungle. That was no accident.
- There are no accidents.
- Whose turn is it?
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.
You might have told us there was a man in there with a rifle that hunts people.
I didn't know, okay?
It's just the roll of the dice.
Is he the reason you didn't wanna play?
You didn't wanna play either...
Mr. We-Started-Something-26-Years-Ago-
And-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?
- What's the deal with you and this guy?
- He's a hunter.
He kills things. Right now, he wants to hunt me and kill me.
- Why you?
- Why me? I don't know.
Everything about me he finds offensive.
You think it'd be a waste of his time.
- Maybe he needs something for his wall.
- It's your turn.
You ever thought about sitting down and talking about your differences?
What, are you crazy?
The man has a gun.
Don't ever call me crazy, Alan.
Ever. 'Cause everyone in this town has called me crazy... ever since I told the cops you were sucked into a board game.
- Maybe I should roll.
- You know what it's like to be known... as the little girl who saw Alan Parrish murdered?
You think anybody showed up at my 14th birthday party?
- Hello. I'm rolling now.
- Billy who?
- I'm gonna roll.
- Are you an owl?
- Dig into your higher consciousness...
- Here, just roll.
And find the memory of your old boyfriend.
- The kid who stole your bicycle?
- No, the kid who took you to movies.
"Don't be fooled.
It isn't thunder.
Staying put would be a blunder."
- No, you're immature.
- You are.
I know you are, but what am I?
Do you feel that?
Listen.
Run!
It's a stampede!
The game!
Don't look back!
Not the game!
Why didn't you grab the game, Peter?
Ignore him, honey.
He's a Libra.
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!
Judy, if's Aunt Nora.
Where have you been?
I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.
Wait for me!
- What can I do for you?
- I want a gross of these.
You know, they stopped making these in 1903.
Damn. I shall need a replacement weapon.
There's a waiting period... and you'll have to... fill out these.
Or I could fill these out.
Now, anyone asks, you didn't get this here.
You're not a postal worker, are you?
Quiet.
Okay.
No!
- Peter, that was great.
- Are you okay?
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.
- You gave me chills.
- It was great.
It's nice work.
Come on, gimme the game. Let's go.
Act natural.
- Hey!
- Hide the game.
I don't believe this. Every time there's trouble, I run into you.
Me? I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm taking you in for questioning.
- I'm not going anywhere.
Just a second.
You can't take him. He's...
- Her fiance.
- I thought he was your uncle.
It's all right.
I'll be back soon.
Blast.
Remember you said you'd never abandon your friends?
- We'll finish the game later.
- Later?
I suggest you all go home now.
Okay.
Now how are we supposed to finish the game?
We can't. We can't finish it without him.
What?
What happened?
I thought I could end the game.
I was only ten spaces away.
"A law of Jumanji having been broken... you will slip back even more than your token."
You tried to cheat?
No. I tried to drop the dice so they'd land on 12.
Oh, okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.
Peter, your hands!
Look at your hands!
Ray, come in, this is Willie.
They cleaned out Larry's Hardware, and they're headed for Parrish Common.
I can't stop 'em, Lorraine. You gotta get the Nafional Guard down here now!
What is this about?
I know you know.
Yes, I do, but you wouldn't believe me even if I told you, Carl.
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?
I know a lot more than that.
I know you used to work on the stamping line at Parrish Shoes.
They used to call you
Soleman.
Soleman.
Yeah, that's right.
I was in there too, until old man Parrish fired me.
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.
And I had something I could've turned this whole town around.
- Your shoes.
- Right.
Listen, Carl...
I know it doesn't mean much after 26 years... but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- It's me, Alan.
Thank you.
Come on.
- What's going on?
- Apparently there's a sale happening.
You just saw three monkeys go by on a motorcycle, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Good girl. Come on.
Maybe we can bail him out with a check.
Thanks.
You tell that sniveling coward from me, if he wants...
Give me that, boy!
Hey! Help me!
Get me outta here!
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter. Come on.
There it is!
Wait here.
Got ya, girlie.
When Alan hears of your predicament, he'll come.
He doesn't know I'm here, so this isn't gonna work. I'm going.
Don't move or I'II blow your blinking brains out!
Call the cops!
- That should do it, don't ya think?
- Oh, yeah.
Price check.
If you let me go,
I can stop all this.
It sounds like something out of the
Twilight Zone, but it's true.
Please.
You gotta help me on this.
I know I'm gonna regret it.
Just hold still.
There. I let you go.
Now what are we gonna do?
- You are gonna stay here.
- Those are my keys!
It's for your own good.
You just stay there.
- My handcuff keys. Wait.
- This is something I have to do.
- Alan!
- You'll thank me someday.
Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot involving a woman and two children.
Sounds like the armed perpetrator in the pith helmet and khakis you reported.
- Carl? Come in, Carl.
- Lorraine, come in. Lorraine!
- What's Sir Sav-a-Iot?
- It's a discount store.
- Move over.
- Wait. Gently.
All right.
Don't worry.
I've done this before once.
- Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?
- Monroe and Elm.
- The Episcopal church.
- No, it's not a church anymore.
Now it's a Speedy Burger, or it was.
I don't know what's left of it.
People in this town are goin' loopy.
We got company.
It's all right.
That's a traffic cop. He'll back us up.
- Here's the game.
- Come on. Get outta here.
- Turn the siren off. Right there!
- I got it.
Okay!
Stop your cringing.
I could have shot you at any moment.
Then why didn't you?
You didn't roll the dice.
Alan did.
There it is.
Hit the brakes.
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' 'em.
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' the brakes!
He should be here any moment.
You're all right?
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.
Oh, great.
So remember...
circumstances are never ever out of your control.
End of tape three.
... update on the events unfolding in Brantford, New Hampshire...
where at least 98 people have been hospitalized with symptoms...
ranging from fevers and rashes...
to violent seizures.
Local resources have been strained to the breaking point.
State health officials are asking anyone experiencing symptoms...
to dial 9-1-1.
I got it.
Alan, talk to him. Please?
What? We don't have time for this, okay?
I know, but he's a kid and he was trying to help.
- All right.
- Thank you.
I warned you about this,
Peter.
No, you wanted to play the game.
What, are you crying? You don't cry, all right? You keep your chin up.
Keep your chin up.
Crying never helped anybody do anything, okay?
You have a problem, you face it like a man.
I'm sorry.
Twenty-six years buried in the jungle and I still became my father.
It's okay.
Come here. I'm sorry.
Hey.
It's all right.
Remember what you told me?
It's all right to be afraid.
It's not that.
What is it?
Okay. Ready?
Don't worry. We're gonna have you turned back into your old self in no time flat.
'Cause we're gonna go in here, and together... we're gonna sit down, we're gonna finish that game... no matter what.
Suddenly, I feel right at home.
Lorraine, this is Carl.
I know who's behind this. I'm headin' to the Parrish place. Gimme backup.
Wait!
- Now what?
- Stop!
Wait, stop!
Is there a problem, ma'am?
- Can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?
Jefferson Street.
The old Parrish place.
Do you have children?
A boy and a girl?
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- Get in. I'II explain it on the way.
Fine! Take it!
We gotta get to that house.
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.
Okay, it's my turn.
If you roll a 12, you win.
Okay, ready? Here I go.
It's okay.
"Every month at the quarter moon... there'll be a monsoon... in your lagoon."
Monsoon.
Well, at least we're inside.
Yeah, right.
Well, a little rain never hurt anybody.
Yeah, but a lot could kill you.
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground!
- Okay.
- Come on! Stay together!
You all right?
Alan. What is that?
Swim! Go! Go!
Swim fast! Move!
Keep goin'!
Get on the table!
Peter, get out of the water!
On the chandelier!
Come on, Sarah.
Hang on, Sarah!
Are you okay?
Where is he?
Ma'am, step back and let me handle this, please. It's probably nothing.
They probably left the TV on too loud.
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?
Give me your hand.
- Grab my hand!
- I got it! No!
Take the game.
Here you go.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Alan, you wrestled an alligator for me.
It was a crocodile.
Alligators don't have that little fringe on their hind leg.
Come on.
My mistake.
Come on.
Okay, it's my turn.
I've got it. Colonel Mustard in the library with a wrench.
Clue.
"Beware the ground on which you stand... the floor is quicker than the sand."
- Help me.
- Okay. Stay calm.
Don't struggle.
- Stay calm.
- I'm calm.
- Grab on!
- Pull.
Okay, I got it.
Pull!
Stay calm!
Come on.
Oh, good!
I got you.
Stop giving me things that come apart!
- "There is a lesson..."
- All right.
"There is a lesson you will learn:
I got you.
Sometimes you must go back a turn."
- Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no.
Oh, dear.
Oh, thank you, Judy.
Thank you.
That was quick thinking.
Sarah and I would like to get out of the floor... so it's your turn, Peter.
Okay.
I thought I lost you again.
Thanks for stickin' around this time.
"Need a hand while you just wait... we'll help you out, we each have eight."
- What's that? What is it?
- Nothing.
You don't go "Waah!"
For nothing.
- Oh, my.
- Peter!
My dad kept an ax in the woodshed. Get it.
- Okay.
- Hurry! Go, go, go!
Aunt Nora, it's me, Peter.
Oh, God!
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.
- What?
- It's your turn.
- You can finish if you roll a 7.
- I can't roll!
Put the dice in your mouth...
Bring the game!
Hurry!
- Judy, are you okay?
- I'm fine. Help them.
Come on, Judy.
Gimme the dice!
"You're almost there with much at stake... but now the ground begins to quake."
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I wish Mom and Dad were here.
So do I.
Our only chance is if we finish the game!
It's your turn!
Oh, my God.
- Get the game! The game!
- No, I won't let you go!
Don't move!
Stand up.
What's in your hand?
Drop it.
End of the line, Sonny Jim.
Game's up.
Stop running.
No.
- Aren't you afraid?
- I'm terrified.
But my father told me... you should always face what you're afraid of.
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.
Any last words?
Jumanji.
No, Alan!
Forgot my speech notes.
I'm so glad you're back.
I've only been gone five minutes.
It seems like a lot longer to me.
I thought you told me you were never gonna talk to me again.
Whatever I said, Dad...
I'm sorry.
Look, Alan, I was angry.
I'm sorry too. I'm sorry.
You don't have to go to Cliffside if you don't want to.
Let's talk it over tomorrow, man-to-man.
How about father-to-son?
All right.
Hey, I gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honor.
Dad?
Back in 196...
I mean, today in the factory... it wasn't
Carl Bentley's fault.
I put the shoe on the conveyor belt.
I'm glad you told me, son.
Thanks.
Bye, Dad.
Good-bye.
Holy smokes!
Judy and Peter!
They're not there.
It's 1969.
They don't even exist yet.
I'm starting to forget what it's like to be a grown-up.
That's okay. As long as we don't forget each other.
Or Judy and Peter.
Alan, there's something
I've been wanting to do... and I better do it before I feel too much like a kid.
They probably don't teach driver training in the sixth grade, huh?
God and sinners reconciled
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
Merry Christmas.
Want to try one of these?
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark, he herald angels sing
No, Dad. It's a new cross-trainer.
It's doing fabulous.
- It's not a bra. It's a shoe.
- Honey, they're here.
Dad, I gotta run. Merry Christmas.
We'll pick you up at the airport.
You'll be the best
Christmas gift of all. Bye-bye.
- They're here.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Pardon me.
- Jim, glad you could make it.
- Thanks.
- This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi, Martha. This is Sarah.
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?
Oh, my God, there they are.
How'd you know?
A guess. A guess, of course.
They're your kids.
You're right.
These are our children.
Judy and Peter. Kids, say hi to Mr. And Mrs. Parrish.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
You're just like we remembered you.
I feel like we know so much about them... because, you know...
- You've told Alan so much about them.
- And I told her.
- Yeah.
- I'll go get the presents.
Sure, honey.
Well, we love children.
- Merry Christmas.
- Cool!
- When can you start?
- Martha and I were thinking... of taking a little skiing holiday up in the Canadian Rockies.
No!
Sorry.
We... We just...
Need you to get that marketing done on the new line pronto.
No problem.
I could probably start next week.
That'd be great.
Let me introduce you to the rest of the folks you'll be working with.
Come on in.
Our house was your house.
Is, anytime you like.
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Long, long ago, in a faraway land a young woodcarver took secretly to the forest.
His name was Geppetto, and he was shy and quiet.
Oh, and very much in love. l carve this heart for dear Leona... while in this peaceful meadow.
With dreams and hope... my love endures.
Forever yours, Geppetto.
Sooner or later, though, when the heart is full... and the heavens are listening, magic... is bound to happen.
Legendas : Jdacd's
For many years after,
Geppetto kept to his chores, and the forest kept Geppetto's secret.
But the forest knew one thing that Geppetto did not: that miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles are made in the heart
A log underneath the wheel.
Oh, l got to take you home.
A very good one, too.
All right.
Here we go.
@ My wife's the blushing, blooming rose of dawning
@ Without the sting
Morning, Luigi
Put a sock in it, Luigi!
@ Welcome, welcome
@ Blessed morning sun
@ Welcome, welcome
@ New day just begun
@ Buon giorno, life
@ Buon giorno, sun
@ Buon giorno, wife
@ My Little one
@ That's my little song
@ Good day, buon giorno, everyone
@ Housework, homework
@ Off to work we go
@ Buying, selling
@ Making money so that we can eat
@ And we can drink
@ and we can have a little fun
@ l've sung my little song
@ And now my little song is done
@ Buon giorno, Life, buon giorno, sun
@ Buon giorno, wife, my little one
@ That's my little song
@ Good day, buon giorno, everyone
Watch this
Oops, looks like you've dropped your wood,
Signor Puppetmaker.
Maybe l should be morecareful next time
Let's go boys.
Hey, last one to the bridge gets dunked.
Yoo hoo, everybody. l'm home.
All right, don't say hello.
Hello, little one.
How was your day?
Ah, that's nice. Me... l got lost in the forest.
Used to be a time when west was west.
Are you two fighting again?
What's the problem this time?
He said l have a funny nose. l said you have a funny toes.
Funny nose.
Funny toes.
Now stop it. l'm tired of hearing you two argue.
Stop it!
You know what happens to bad little boys who fight?
They go to bed without being sandpapered. lt's chilly.
There. lt's going to be a chilly night.
This log has a will of it's own.
Let's see if we can find a face to match.
Our heart.
Anyone who wants a new brother, say so now.
All right, all right, don't everybody talk at once. l'm going to make the most perfect nose.
A world of wisdom could be told in a nose.
Open wide.
Give me a big smile.
Nina, go find yourself a mouse.
Blue eyes, just like your papa.
Bellissimo.
Now would you like your papa to show you how to walk?
Yes?
Very nice.
What a smart little boy you are.
Excuse me, coming through!
Now say hello to your brothers and sisters.
Say hello.
They'll keep you company while l'm at work.
Now what shall we call you, dear child, hmm?
You're made of pine.
That's a start.
You have beautiful eyes.
Occhi magnifico.
We'll call you...
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio.
Better to have puppets... than noisy little boys running around.
Oh, my back is... l'm not as young as l used to be.
Nina, leave that puppet alone!
Behave yourself!
Excuse me, coming through.
Ah, get the soap.
Thank you.
Now get me the scrub brush.
Scwub-bwsh. lt's happened. l've finally lost my mind.
Mind... lt's impossible!
You can't be real!
Real.
But you're a puppet!
Pup-peh...
Pa-pa!
No, l'm not your papa!
Wait, Pinocchio.
Stop!
Come down right now!
What are you doing?
Come down this instant, young... man.
Come down here! l'm not going to go chasing after you.
Luigi, please, put a sock in it!
Pinocchio, hold on, l'll save you!
No!
Take off my underwear right now!
Pinocchio, listen to me.
Pinocchio?
Right. Listen to me.
Papa.
No, l--No, that's not--
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.
No, l'm not your papa.
Papa, papa, papa...
You are a puppet.
You're not a real boy.
Real boy.
No! And be glad for it. lf you were a real boy, you'd have to have doctor istead of--
Sit still!
Look at this mess! l'll have to wash all over again.
Ciao, Geppetto.
Quite a new puppet.
He's amazing.
He still needs work.
So do you. Look at you, you were up all night again.
- l slept a little.
- You were up all night. l made these for Lorenzini's puppets, but l think he needs them more.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Wouldn't want his head to fry, either.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bet your house is full of sawdust. l'll come by and sweep it up.
Leona, l'm not a child.
The Little one, does he have a name?
Pinocchio.
Enchanted.
Leona
Leona...
You even gave him your heart.
Our heart
What did you say?
Nothing.
Come, Pinocchio.
Come, Pinocchio.
Come, Papa.
Seems a little stiff, Leona.
Just like his father.
Marco, look!
Look here.
Wow! Look at that.
Wow!
Stop it!
What are you doing? lt's your color.
- Did l ask for a scarf?
- No.
Then get rid of it. l'll take that one.
He's magnificent, Geppetto!
Do you see what l see?
Yes!
What?
He is more than-- he's just-- he's...
Well, l--well...
How did you do this? l don't know.
Where are the strings? l-- l don't know.
You don't know. l don't know.
Tino, am l going crazy? l have no idea how this happened.
They're going to burn me at the stake!
No, no, they've stopped burning people.
They might hang you, though.
Excuse me, coming through.
Then you'll know where the strings are.
Are you real boy?
Yes. Are you?
Yes
Hello
Hello
Oh, my, what an intriguing little item you are.
May l?
Empty as a witch's dowry.
Oh, and look how smoothly his arms move.
Volpe, Felinet...
Excuse me, but haven't you two got a pushcart to rob?
We've already done that.
Come, Pinocchio.
Oh, but, Geppetto, darling, we were just playing with him.
He'll play with his own sort, thank you.
And what sort would that be?
Pinocchio, don't wander away like that. l don't want you to do that. l don't get it. ls he a boy or a puppet?
He's a puppet, furface, and he's worth a fortune.
And l know exactly where to cash him in.
Don't worry, son, l'll get your ball back.
Take my kid's ball, would you?
Listen closely.
Next week's puppet show... must be the most spectacular ever.
Every single boy must be in attendance.
Lorenzini, darling.
Felinet, looking for employment? l see my timing is purr-fect!
What l've seen will assure you... more curtain calls than Rome has rats.
Do tell.
There, there. That's better.
That's didn't hurt, did it?
No. Didn't hurt.
What does he want?
Open up.
No good can come of this.
Be very quiet.
Stay here and be quiet
Don't even breathe.
Do you understand?
Open up!
Signor Lorenzini, uh...
Geppetto, my friend.
To want do l owe this honor?
The honor is mine to call a gain on the man... with the magical hands. l bring good news, Geppetto. l am mounting my grandest production ever, and l want to purchase your newest creation... whatever that might be. l've been spending a great deal of time in the forest lately. l will carve you something very special the first chance l get. l was looking for something with, shall we say, thinner strings.
Thinner strings?
Why-- why didn't you say so? Come. l've gotjust the thing.
These wonderful pieces are made of cherry wood, and they are on sale this week only.
Don't toy with me. l didn't buy those puppets from you two years ago, and l'm not going to buy them today, so show me your best... and show me now.
Excuse me. Coming through. lncredibile.
He is perfect.
Stay.
- Boys do little bugs.
- Bugs
Don't they?
They like to tease them... and twist them and--
Please, Lorenzini.
Name your price.
He's not for sale.
- Geppetto, everything is for sale.
- Stay, Stay!
Not him.
Not at any price.
Stay, bug.
You can have the emperor and his daughter, and that's it.
You are making a big mistake,
Geppetto.
That's my last offer.
Take it or leave it.
Very well. l will take these lovely puppets off your hands. l'm just burning with ideas.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Geppetto.
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio lnfantino is a creep.
Hey, fatty!
You're late, dimwit.
Pinocchio, show yourself right now... because l'm noot leaving this house to look for you again.
Would someone please like to tell us... of a characteristic which separates humans... from the rest of the animal kingdom?
Cages.
Humans cry tears, professore.
Ah, tears.
Expressions of the soul.
Do any other creatures look so deeply within themselves?
No, professore. Only humans.
We must always decide what is right and wrong.
Excellent.
Hey, Woody.
You ever get termites?
What are termites?
They're bugs. l like bugs.
Not these kind, you don't.
They eat wood like you.
Hey, lay off my friend, Woody.
Lay off my friend, Woody.
What is going on in my classroom?
The new kid punched Lampwick, professore. ls that true?
No
Hey, how'd you do that?
Silence.
Now, you're not lying to me by any slim chance, are you?
There are two kinds of lies-- lies that have short legs and lies that have a long nose, and yours are clearly the kind that have long nose.
Now, l will give you one last chance to redeem yourself. lf you didn't punch Lampwick, how did he end up on the floor?
Nobody punched Lampwick.
Lampwick punched himself. l--l mean, a man climed in the window and punched him.
And Lampwick tried to kick him back, but he missed and fell on the floor, and--
Silence. lnfantino!
Silence! lnfantino, go on, go on.
Handkerchief. Go on, quickly.
Run, run, run, run, run!
Right, l did punch Lampwick, professore, and l'm sorry
Well, it's too late for that now. lf there's one thing l will not tolerate... in my classroom, it's a liar.
Out.
And... l'm sorry that l kicked him, too.
Out.
And l'm even more sorry that l told a lie.
Out, out, l said.
But l want to stay and learn.
Now, class, we will review what we have learned today. lf anything happened to him, he's going to be in big trouble. lf l don't find him, l'm never talking to him again.
Pinocchio! lt's finished. lsn't it beautiful?
Everything you bake is beautiful, dear.
You know, l sold it to the magistrate by the pound, and the best part is, l cheated on the weight.
You're very good at that, dear. lt reminds me of the cake that we had on our wedding day.
Don't eat that.
- l'm not eating anything.
- Not you!
Look!
Mmm, more? l'll give you more.
You're a bad boy, huh?
Real bad boy.
Little mischief maker.
Your father's going to pay for this!
Got him.
Even better.
Pinocchio.
Papa, want some?
Geppetto, he's yours?
Arrest him.
Arrest both of them.
You're under arrest, signore.
Wait.
Papa.
Come on. you, too, little one.
Hey, stop him!
There goes our commission.
Au contraire. l have a feeling ourjob just got easier.
Come on, now. lt's past your bedtime. lnto bed.
Good night, son. l love you, Papa. l love you, Papa. l can't do anything right.
The human dilemma.
Who said that?
Or is it the puppet dilemma?
You've still got cake on your face.
What?
Say, do you always squish someone... before being formally introduced?
Are--are you a termite?
Oh, please!
So you're not going to eat me.
Thanks for the offer, but li'm on a low-wood diet.
Let me introduce myself.
The name is...
Pugnacio Elecuzio P. Elegante.
Give me a ''P,'' an ''E,'' a ''P,'' an ''E.''
Put'em all together and call me...
Pepe.
- Pepe?
- You don't like it?
- lt's OK.
- l'm very sensitive, you know.
No. lt's--it's fine.
We can't all be called Pinocchio.
Now listen to me. l'm here because you are one tumult little puppet.
Your papa's in jail, you're all alone, you trounced me in the alley, and l'm here to see that we get our friendship back on track... right this very second!
Sorry.
Didn't meant to holler, but insects are people, too, you know?
And l'm a lot more than your standard garden-variety cricket. l'm a teller of truths. l'll be your best friend, pine cone. l'll open your eyes. l'm not a pine cone. l'm a boy.
Not yet, but it's a top-notch goal... for such a cute little puppet, which is why it's time to get to work.
You ca become a real boy one you get the tools. l'll advise you and be your regal guardian, but you've got to do the hard work.
You, my little sapling, will have to shed something blood, sweat, and tree bark.
Total eclipse.
Visitors. How wonderful.
Get the door, and be polite, and smile, now.
Show those pearly whites.
No, stop.
- Let me go.
- Come on. We've got you now.
Court is now in session.
Case number 491, your honor.
The People versus Luca Antonio
Renaldo Geppetto Baldini.
My papa. lt will be all right, Pinocchio.
There he is, your honor, the little mutilator.
He ruined my cannolis.
He ruined my fruit tarts.
Silence, woman.
He even ruined my grandmother's torta della nonna... with the pinoli and the chocolate--
Are you done?
No, l am not done. l would--
Arrest her!
Now l'm done.
Now...
Since you, Geppetto, are responsible for this, uh, puppet, how do you plead?
Guilty, sir.
You will pay 20,000 lira to the bakers... and 10,000 to the court. l--l don't have it.
That--that's three years' wages. lf you cannot pay, then you will go to debtors prison.
Three years locked away.
Your honor. l propose the court allow me to pay the fines... for this poor, impoverished peasant.
This is most generous of you, Signore Lorenzini.
Kindness is my weakness.
Of course, no good deed should go without obligation, so all l ask is to keep
Pinocchio in return.
Lorenzini, please, take any other puppet. l will work for you day and night the rest of my life.
Geppetto, is itjust money for you?
Pinocchio needs a home.
All you can offer him... is table scarps and cold winter nights, but with me, he will have a family.
What's a family, Papa?
My goodness, such a heartbreaking question, one no one should ever have to ask.
Pinocchio, l can give you a life... other little boys only dream of.
What is your decision, Geppetto?
Listen to me.
You're going to go with that man now.
But l want to be with you. l know, but you see--you see, there--there's no other choice.
You're my papa. l can't be your papa.
You're made of wood.
You're not flesh.
You're not a real boy.
Now go, for everyone's good!
Let's go.
Son.
Good boy. l love you, Papa. l'm sorry.
Why does everything good get thrown to the beasts?
@ No to tyranny
@ He shall not have his pleasure
@ for goodness shall prevail l see gold out there-- little pieces of gold.
Yeah, Woody!
@ All the world is waiting
@ A maiden l must save
@ No time for hesitating
@ lf only l were brave
@ For now is the hour
@ l must be the hero
@ lt's my call, that's my cue
@ lt's everything or nothing
@ Look out, he's coming through
Sorry.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through. l'll save you--
Sorry.
Puny peasants! l'll save you, princess.
@ Oh, the giant
@ Please stand up in defiance
@ The princess shall be mine!
Hey, you up there with the beard.
@ l was made of freedom
@ Nobody pulls my strings
@ And l can equal any man
@ ln all the grown-up things
@ And l will do or die
@ For l know one thing after all
@ The bigger any giant comes
@ The harder he may fall
@ My hero
@ He saved me
@ My hero, my hero, my hero, my hero, my hero l love being a star.
Of course you do.
All real boys love being stars.
Now this is all yours,
Pinocchio.
You can buy anything you want, and after tonight, there will be more.
Here.
Now hurry, son.
Get ready for the next scene.
Champagne.
OK, kiddo, now we're in the swing of things.
Lesson number one-- beware of temptation.
Applause may be good for the moment, but love is everlasting. l do have love.
Lorenzini loves me.
That's not love.
He's fooling you.
He's got evil plans in the works, and he's using you to make them come true.
Why do you have to make everything so hard?
No pain, no gain.
They love us.
To success.
Wait till they see what l've got for them next.
Pinocchio, you're on.
@ What are we made of?
@ Can we know what we will be?
@ Whar are the chances
@ l can find the better path
@ The better life
@ The better me?
@ What are we made of?
@ lf you think you know the answer
@ Turn arround
@ Think again
@ Carabonza!
@ The fire-breathing monster
@ Alas, we are undone
Stand by for fireworks.
Here's your proof, Pinocchio.
This is how much
Lorenzini loves you.
You can save the others, if you want.
This is your chance, Pinocchio.
You can do what's right.
Those puppets are your brothers and sisters.
Stop it.
Brilliant acting, Pinocchio.
Geppetto made them. l won't let them burn.
Good work!
- No.
- Yes. ls it hot in here, or is it me? Ciao!
Come here, you little--
There.
Get him.
Signor Lorenzini, l'm sorry things didn't quite work out. l don't know. l think things turned out rather well. l guess you'll pay us our commission now, huh?
Pay you? l will kill you if you don't bring me that puppet. l thought you were burned.
Where's my Pinocchio?
There he is! On the bridge!
Grab him!
@ What are we made of?
@ Just for this moment
@ Take your life into your hands
@ You'll decide what you are made of
@ What it is that l can be
@ Turn arround
@ Think again
Pinocchio?
Oh, Leona l've been all over town.
So have l. l hope you had more luck. l asked Carmella if she'd seen Pinocchio.
She said no.
But then l went to see Tino.
He said no.
But then l went to see
Maria, the witch-- the one who hasn't spoken in years.
- What did she say?
- Nothing.
But... she gave me this.
A stick?
What's it mean?
Think about it.
Pinocchio probably feels like he can't come home, like he'd only be in trouble if he does.
Yes...
Where would you go if you felt that way? l... don't know.
Someplace safe.
And where would that be, given the fact that you're made out of wood?
The forest.
Thank you, Maria.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.
Smell that pine.
You know, they ought to bottle that scent... so you can spray it arround your house.
Have l told you what an honor it is to be your cricket?
You were brilliant last night.
You stayed cool when things got hot.
You did the right thing, and you deserve to be proud.
This is where l belong.
You know, l prefer the beach myself, but property there is so expensive.
You've gone back to your roots. l know you feel lost, Pinocchio.
Believe me, it's only natural, but you can't stay here.
Go away, please. l fell happy here.
You can't sleep your problems away.
You've got to get back to your papa.
Bye.
We've got to roll.
Let's make tracks. Let's go!
Follow me! Off we go!
Run. Run. Run.
Pepe?
Where are you when l need you?
Quit it!
Peck on someone your own size.
''Let's get into the puppet business,'' you said.
- l never--
- Shut up!
- ''We'll be rich,'' you said.
- l didn't...
Shut up. ''He's worth a fortune,'' you said.
Why do l always listen to you?
Get off!
Go away.
Who do you suppose that might be?
Are you serious?
Go away.
Pinocchio!
Out of my way.
Let's put Lorenzini off forjust a few more minutes.
Hey, l know you.
You're friends with Lorenzini.
We're finished with him now.
- We're repugnant.
- Repentant.
Yeah, that, too.
And we're here to ask for forgiveness.
What's forgiveness?
Forgiveness means that when you did something really wrong, you want somebody to tell you... that it wasn't really, really wrong, when you know what you did was wrong because you did it!
Please forgive me for being a puppet, instead of a real boy for my papa. l miss my daddy, too.
You know, it is possible... for you to become a real boy.
How?
All you need is a miracle.
What's a miracle?
A miracle is--
Miracles make your dreams come true, and you could buy one... with enough of these.
Look... l have four more.
Very good.
Will you people be quiet!
Unfortunately, you're just a little short.
But you might have enough if... lf what? lf you planted them and let them grow.
Where?
Why, in the field of miracles, of course.
The field of miracles.
Faster.
Found the perfect spot.
Stop. That's deep enough.
Now cover the hole and let it cook.
For one hour.
Exactly.
Just keep going this way.
Leona, please, don't tell me about the forest. l've been coming out here with my brother, Enzio-- may he rest in peace-- since l was a little boy.
Stop.
He was here.
Maybe he's not far off.
Now you stand here and watch that clock.
The big hand will go all the way around... and come back to the top, and that's an hour.
Got it?
Got it.
@ Our souls are like a cup of cappuccino
@ Strong and dark
@ Strong and dark
Out of the woods, huh?
What are you doing now?
Watching the clock.
Why?
So l can buy a miracle.
Any particular brand?
Real Boy brand.
Here's how it works--
You dig a hole, you plant your gold, you let it cook--
The first lesson about trust is learning whom to trust.
Didn't this gold deal seem a little shaky? l don't know.
A little.
And let me guess... you ignored your instincts.
- Didn't you?
- Maybe.
You just don't give maybe to the president of the Cricket Union.
Now, let's say we regroup and talk about your papa.
Or l'll be falling down on the job.
Look, my papa wants me to be a real boy. l'm staying right here and waiting for my miracle.
Your papa want you, no matter what you're made of.
Be a loving son, and the real boy stuff will take care of itself.
So remember, you heard it here first.
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles are made in the heart.
Stupid me!
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Hey, Woody!
Stop!
Come on. Come with us.
We're going to the greatest place. lt's great. There's no school.
No rules.
You can do whatever you want.
And it's just for boys.
Just for boys?
Yep. Real boys.
Look. Look. There he is.
Where? l don't see him. l'm sure. l'm going to be a real boy!
Hey, Woody, watch out for your hat.
Welcome to the Terra Magica!
New boys.
[ Skipped item nr. 770 ]
Wait a minute. l thought there were-- l forgot the biggest rule of them all!
There are no rules.
That's more like it!
[ Skipped item nr. 775 ]
[ Skipped item nr. 776 ]
He's out there.
Not necessarily.
What do you think this is? lt's his hat, the one l gave to him. l'm going to go find him.
Now wait one minute.
You're going to kill youself for one of your puppets?
He's my son. l've already let one great love slip through my fingers. l don't want it to happen again.
You've never been in a boat in your life.
You can't even swim. l can row.
But, Geppetto... you may never come back. ln that case, l'll tell you why... you should never have married my brother.
Why?
Because you should have married me!
The day l carved that heart in the tree, you accepted my brother's proposal.
25 years you take to tell me, and l'm supposed to wait?
You're too late. l'm not waiting!
This is foul.
Foul?
Come on, Woody, you're missing all the fun!
Hey, your turn, Woody!
Rather cruel of you to shoot my cousins into outer space.
All l'm doing is having a little fun.
Fun? Your idea of fun... puts my antenna way out of whack, and what about your papa, since you brought him up? l didn't bring him up.
Precisely my point!
You know he wouldn't want you acting like ajackass, and if you act like one, you'll become one!
This is how you light it,
Woody.
Taht's it. l can't go on a trip. l forgot to go to the bathroom!
Act like ajackass, if you have the nerve.
Drink up the water.
Get what you deserve.
Be wicked, be naughty.
Come drink from my fountain, then l will be rich-- king of the mountain.
Let mr try.
Nice shooting.
Look. No, look... l'll show you how.
No!
Sorry.
That's my gun.
No, it's mine, Lampshade.
Nobody calls me Lampshade.
You give me the gun.
Nice shot.
Hey... l can see right through him.
What's all this?
He sarted it.
You liar.
Stop! Let's settle this.
Tokens for the ride of your life.
You have all earned it.
For you... and you.
Hey, swiss cheese, we're going on the big one.
Me, too.
Sell these jackasses to the circus... and at the market--
20,000 lira each-- then skin one... for a new pair of boots.
We're going on the big one, Woody.
The big one.
Here we go.
Aw, yeah.
Coming through! l'm a real boy. l'm a real boy.
Come on! Whoa! Faster!
All right!
Hey, Woody, you're leaking! l guess some guys just can't hold their water.
Faster!
What's wrong with you? l don't know. l don't feel so good.
You don't look so good, either.
Where'd you get that?
Here's another batch, signor.
Corral them. l don't want to be ajackass. l don't want to be ajackass.
Don't panic, Pinocchio.
Keep your wits.
Please, Pepe, get me out of here.
You can do it. Be brave.
Don't let fear tie you up.
Yikes!
One of them didn't drink their water, signor!
- Catch him!
- He's gone.
Don't let him get away!
Go and find him!
There...behind the donkey.
Calm these donkeys!
Of course, signore.
Go. Go. Go.
Come on. Go.
Run!
Get him! l will break you into firewood... puppet!
Come here. Over here.
No, this is all wrong.
You got to believe me.
Look, they're trying to trick you.
They wants us to behave badly.
Don't go on the ride. Please!
We've been acting like jackasses, so that's what we turn into.
Well, well, well...
Here l provide you with the most wonderful place to frolic, and this is the thanks l get?
You steal my donkeys?
They're not your donkeys.
This one's Lampwick.
Pinocchio, a good boy does not go around spreading lies. lt's not a lie.
My nose grows when l lie.
Come on, boys. Take the ride.
Drink the water.
No, don't!
Be yourselves!
Lampwick...
Go on.
He's turning into a monster.
Look at his face.
Lorenzini's turned into a monster.
Lorenzini was a monster.
He was a monster and got what he deserved.
Jackasses! l'm going home.
Thanks, Pinocchio.
Home home home home! l don't care if l never become a real boy anymore. l just want to get home to my papa.
There you are. l knew you didn't go out to sea.
Where have you been?
We were so worried, and look at you.
Have you eaten?
You're so skinny.
Where is my papa?
He's out there somewhere, looking for you.
Wait, Pinocchio! lt's too dangerous. lf you think l'm going to wait... for both of you--
You don't even know how to swim. l'm not scared. l'm not scared. l smell seaweed.
Are--are we at the beach?
Pepe, l thought you left me.
Ahoy, captain.
Where are we now?
Boy, you sure get into a let of trouble.
You know, it smells an awful lot... like rotten chili peppers in here.
Lorenzini, he must be the sea monster.
OK. Fine. Enjoy yourself. l'm playing cricket this afternoon.
Hey, l'm a clamophobic.
Quiet.
We're in this together, now.
But--but--but l'm afraid of the dark.
Papa!
Oh, sure, like he's just around the corner.
He might be.
Oh, you two had plans to meet here for dinner?
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
Coming through. lf only it were true.
Where were you?
Let's try to find a way out of here.
Come. lt smells like rotten chili peppers in here.
The throat. hold on.
Pinocchio, hold on.
Go, Pinocchio.
Not without you.
Go, l said.
No. Push it open. l can't get through there.
Now, do as l say! l hate you, Papa.
What? l never, ever missed you.
That's a lie. l wish l never found you. l never wanted to be your son. l want to stay a puppet.
Lies, all lies.
Don'tjudge my cooking by this, OK?
Are you OK, Papa?
Wake up.
Forgive me, Pinocchio... for doubting my heart and letting you go. l'm sorry, too, Papa. l'm sorry for not... for not being a rea boy.
But you're real to me, my son.
Real to me.
Oh, l love you. l love you, too, Papa. l'm a boy.
Tell me it's true.
Miracles are made in the heart, Papa.
Yoo-hoo, hello. l'm in the dark in here.
What am l missing?
Have the pilgrims landed? l don't even want to know what happened.
Keep it to youself.
Nice to know you, junior.
Lots of luck.
You look good in the flesh, a real doll--uh, boy, but l got to go. Ciao.
You're leaving again? l'm just starting to have a good time.
Leaving?
That would make me a hypo-cricket.
Union rules-- l'm with you forever. l just got to get some sleep.
Papa! Pap, stop the cart.
- What?
- Please stop the cart.
There's just one more little thing... l need to take care of. lt'll only take a minute. l'm not going to sleep in no barn.
Fine, then sleep in the doghouse.
Hello.
Don't you answer back when a person greets you?
Hello.
Haven't l seen you somewhere before?
No. Believe me, l just got here.
That sure isn't very much gold you've got there.
Excuse me, sonny. We're rich.
That's not rich.
This is rich.
That's nothing but a rock.
Yes, but if you take this road five miles, there's a valley. l've been there.
Drinking the water turns bad boys into donkeys.
Get out of here.
Fine, then l won't tell you about the gold.
Gold?
Keep this to yourselves. lf you drink the water while holding onto a rock...
Yeah? lt turns into gold.
Gold?
Would l lie?
Bye.
See you later, Papa.
Pinocchio, where are you going?
To play with Lampwick.
Did you do your studies and all of your chores?
Yes, Papa.
Sometimes l wish that nose still grew.
Lampwick.
Come on, Woody, let's go.
Careful!
We're--we're very sorry, sir.
Yeah. Let us pick these up.
- Donn't you just hate that kid?
- Not as much as l hate you.
Papa, Papa, l've got a great idea.
How about carving me a girlfriend?
You've been a boy two minutes, already you're thinking about girls?
Am l going to have trouble with you!
And there you have it.
Geppetto and Leona lived happily ever after.
Luigi ate a lot of socks, and all the donkeys turned back into boys. lt took some hard work.
They had to do many good deeds to earn the privilege.
As for me, l took a house on Lake Como... and played canasta with a couple of locusts.
So, ciao, my little saplings.
Arrivederci!
And when you need me, give me a holler.
We'll see if we can arrange something.
There's no smell.
It happened a week ago, you say?
I came home from the shop, and she was in the kitchen.
I said: Rush, Maria Olegovna, they're almost out of yoghurt
And she says in this sad voice:
"I've rushed around enough, it's time I took a rest."
I immediately suspected something was amiss.
Then she went off to her room.
That was the last we saw of her.
To work!

WINDOW TO PARIS
PART 1
Good day, Nikolai Nikolayevich!
Everyone in line!
- Hi!
- Good morning!
- You didn't freeze?
- I'm used to it.
I'm looking at a place today.
-They've given you a flat?
-No, a room in a communal flat.
Good day, Nikolai Nikolaevich!
Nikolai Nikolaevich, why are your children blocking the way?
Herman awoke during the night.
Moonlight flooded his room.
He looked at his watch: a quarter to three.
Sleep left him.
A this moment, someone passing in the street...
...peeking through his window and immediately walked off.
Unfamiliar, shuffling steps approached, the door opened, and on the threshold appeared the figure of a woman in white.
What are you doing in the dark?
Saving electricity?
This is equipment for the school of management.
1 20 megabytes hard memory
Can't you see we're having a lesson?
-I can see.
-Boys, bring the stuff in.
-Get out of here this minute!
Don't mind us.
We'll talk later.
Dear Nikolai Nikolaevich!
You're over-dramatizing the situation.
Nothing terrible has happened.
We simply can't have valuable equipment strewn in the hall.
This is your most valuable equipment!
-Don't you understand?
-That's why we employ you to cultivate, ennoble, refine the soul...
You're talking to me...
...as if I'm a child or an idiot.
For you my subject is rubbish and the children see that.
To be frank, we don't prepare musicians, but businessmen.
If this were a musical college yours would be the main subject.
But you didn't get along there.
Our main subjects are management and marketing.
Sure. You brought up builders of communism.
Now it's builders of capitalism.
And the result is one: beasts of pray and ignorant thieves.
- How many megabytes did you say?
The chrysanthemums in the garden...
...have long since withered.
But love lives on...
...in my sick heart.
Let me kiss you, dear.
Papa, open the door.
Congratulations, daughter.
- Good day. Who are you looking for?
- I'm moving in.
-Into the old woman's room?
-I don't know. It's 1 8 sq.m.
Someone's come to live in the old woman's room.
It's sealed up.
I have a warrant and the key.
We'll break the seal. Come in.
This is where she lived.
Blimey, where have you come from, parasite?
It's the cat of the woman who died here.
She's been dead a year, and he was gone. Suddenly there he is.
Fat as a pig!
As if he'd been feeding at the meat factory.
How'd he get in here?
The furniture is all ours.
Maria Olegovna, when she took her leave, said:
I leave the furniture to you who are like a family to me.
- Where to with the chair?
- Here.
- And this, papa? - Can't you work it out for yourself?
A rental shop...
Concerto for vermicelli and orchestra.
Why so many pianos?
We work at the factory.
You a musician?
Here's to Nikolai Nikolaevich, my neighbor and colleague.
And here's to my other neighbor van Kuzmich!
He's a real fisherman.
Catches eels in the city canal.
I'll fetch some pickled eels right away.
No, don't! They stink of shit!
They live in shit all their life.
OK, we all live in shit.
So fetch your eels.
I don't like eels, myself
Till '83, we got them...
...in our Party rations.
I gave mine to the chauffeur.
I'm a simple fellow, I'd rather suck on some dried fish.
In 70 years, your lot fairy sucked us dry!
And now see what we have to suck!
I left your party before the putsch.
Your kind just comes and leaves by any asshole.
I always carry my Party card!
I'll die with it.
Here's to the last communist!
Ditch you lousy school.
Do you need those juvenile slobs?
You'll be better off working at our factory. We need tuners.
We play in the orchestra every night and every day we're drunk.
We play in the orchestra every night and every day we're drunk.
Max, Max!
So here you are, you rascal!
I'll have a few words to say to you at home.
See that?
We're pissed.
Who was that?
The dead old woman, my neighbor.
We'll have to call a priest to have the room blessed.
Where did she go to?
- Who?
- Your old woman.
To the cemetery, where else?
She was a plague in life, and still is.
What a cupboard!
Did you see that?
In 20 years I never knew there was a way out to the roof.
So that's how she comes and goes from the cemetery.
- Were you at the funeral?
- No. She simply disappeared.
Maybe she didn't die, after all.
You mean she comes flying in here alive?
That's a lot of nonsense.
- You can feel it's got warmer.
- Another drink's what we need.
- What time is it?
You've got a lively night life here.
-The fire escape's on the left.
- Let's get there.
- Lads, what's that down there?
- A porcupine!
You'd do better to go to bed.
I can't stand the sound of a broken piano being murdered.
We'll be late. They'll close.
I can't go backwards down the ladder.
A step is missing here.
Where to now?
Don't step on my hand!
It really has got warmer.
- Shh! Quiet now!
- Hold on, lads!
There used to be a beer stall here.
We always had a mug before school.
Every bastard knows me here.
It's a foreign currency joint!
Let's beat it!
Hold it! Why can't I, a native
Russian,...
...have a mug of beer in my own country?
Not enough? Have some more.
See how they treat us Russians?
Remember our Party.There was nothing like this in its days.
Take this, it's all I've got.
Still not enough?
If I have no stinking bucks!
Does that mean I can't have a beer?
Hey, look: they accept "baldies"!
- I've got one, too!
- I only collect these.
Excellent beer!
I haven't had it so good for ages.
And we get by without your party.
Tomorrow we'll come with a canister.
- I think you fell, Petia.
- Not me. My body did.
See how well they mended the street!
If you give our people a free hand, they'll do anything.
But for the TV tower, I'd never known my neighborhood.
If you only knew...
...how dear to me...
...are Petersburg evenings!
Here we go. Get in, lads.
See you tomorrow, Gorokhov!
Kolia, good-bye!
- Get in, Fedia!
- I'll take the subway.
It's closed. It's past 3 AM.
Don't be a nut. Let's go.
Kolia! I'm so glad you've moved in with us.
I'm fed up with the dames.
But I liked you the moment I saw you.
Ditch your school and come to...
...our "Red October" musical instruments factory!
Days, you'll tune pianos.
Nights, we'll play near the subway...
Stop!
This is more than I can bear!
Why did you do that?
Stop! That's bad, unsynchronized.
- The Director summons you.
- Can't you see we have a class?
I'm sorry.
The collective has decided:
For behavior inconsistent with a pedagogue's calling... e.g., systematic infringement of pedagogical ethics, childish populism and damage to equipment...
...belonging to the Lycee,
Nikolai Chizhov, teacher of music and aesthetics, is to be dismissed from the teachers' staff...
...and his class time to be turned over to priority subjects
Anything biting?
Biting? Nothing but condoms.
They've fouled up the whole ecology, the bums!
On this very spot,
I used to catch bream this big!
And now you're lucky if you catch a lousy minnow!
Excuse me, are you the last in this queue?
Where have you been?
-They've given me the sack...
- Forget it! Come take a look!
Look!
I'm being refracted...
What's the matter with you?
I'm undergoing special refraction.
What's that?
I'm undergoing refraction in space, blockhead!
Bloody heck!
Don't just stand there!
Come here!
Well? Does it remind you of some place?
Right! We're in Paris, comrade.
Hold on tight, or your head will start spinning again!
To hell with it! Impossible!
I can't believe it!
- It's possible, Kolia!
-The discovery of the century!
Of course, it's the discovery of the century.
God! We must invite the scientists.
The specialists.
You off your head?
You want a frontier post here and a kick in the ass from us?
Not a word to anyone.
- Hey!
- Yes, that's good.
Just be grateful I brought you here.
No scientists. This is for the two of us.
They write in French so we won't understand.
Here's a fine job: a turn of the handle and money pours.
The perfume doesn't come cheap here.
Look: loads of stuff down the whole street, and not a buyer in sight.
Who needs that?
Forty varieties! All this'll rot, they'll dump it.
But if you ask for some, they'll rather die than give it.
The French are stingy.
See the bottles they drink from!
And they say we Russians are drunkards. They started it all.
These are our furs, from Siberia!
How many Russian mink die for their prostitutes to dress up!
What a monster! Don't think of taking it home: you'll go blind.
More radioactive than Chernobyl!
That fat mug should be pulling a cart, but he's in films.
Oh, it's me! The bastards!
Here's the fire escape! And the bar!
But where's the embankment?
Simple enough. We're looking for a bar by the embankment.
-There's our street!
- Are you sure?
- Or maybe over there...
- Where? There or there?
- The devil can tell...
-That's it. Farewell, Russia.
Hey!
- You could see the tower there.
- You can see it anywhere.
Here's the embankment.
There was one there, too.
Kuzmich! How did you get here?
-Through your ass.
- Lie! Through the old woman's room!
Why should I be tramping through other people's rooms?
Do you know where you are?
First time in a year they bite and you addling my brains.
- Go away!
- Where to? We're lost!
What do I care?
Come here! Here it is!
Here's the wall, and here's the fire escape ladder.
They're so rich they throw away motorcycles like this!
Churches all about and they don't even believe in God!
Look who's here to greet us!
-That's where the pig got so fat!
- Well, expect a visitation!
I'll take care of this visitation tonight.
The insolent bum walking about as if he owns the place.
He brought us to Paris and all you can do is shout at him.
Look at this!
- So you speak French?
- No, it's an Ives Montand song.
If you think you can get away with this, you're mistaken.
The police know about your last night carousal.
You'll have to respond before the law.
What does she want?
She says thank you for tuning her piano.
You're welcome, Madam.
It was no trouble.
Play the fool at home in Poland, but observe the laws of civilized society here.
She definitely wants something.
What could a Parisienne want of a Russian peasant?
You've inflicted damage for 5500 francs!
Look what a mess you've made of my studio!
I told you! She's asking us in.
Take my advice, don't be shy. demand you pay damages and put the studio in order.
Don't pretend you don't understand.
I have witnesses.
Watch her wiggle her fanny!
How am I to restore this composition?
-That's a hint! Hot babe!
- I think she's repulsive!
What about the divan?
What'll I do about these stains?
And the lobster?
You broke its pincher!
She wants the crab position on the divan!
Gorokhov!
Darn Vera found the door. I'm off!
Take the condom. They've got
AIDS all about here. shit face? Everyone's looking for you.
Already found yourself a dame, you jerk!
What do you mean?
She's Nikolai's bird!
Parasite! Waving your arms too!
What's this brawl about?
And who are you, anyway?
You don't speak French at all?
I've had enough. I'm calling the police.
Don't call the police. Don't be afraid, we won't hurt you.
I'll fix your piano free of charge.
Monsieur Prevant, help me get rid of him!
You don't understand!
Stop, lads. Here it is.
The bridge, the tower, the river and the bar!
That river was like Fontanka.
This one's a piddling ditch.
No more questions. On we go.
I'd say this detail is revealing of your friend's character.
You're right, Coco new not fear.
He attacked even the largest dogs and turned them to flight.
The best are the first to die, unfortunately.
In our family, all the males are fighters.
My grandfather, cavalier of the Legion of Honor, was a fighter.
So was my father. Likewise, myself.
And Coco, too.
Max! Max!
Meow, you old witch!
Good day, Maria Olegovna!
Have you nice neighbors in the other world, or louts like us?
You ought to be ashamed, Maria.
If you want shopping done or the doctor, call us, but Paris...
All Paris needs is you! You've done enough spoiling this place.
We forgot to ask your permission to take a walk about Paris.
The window belongs to us now!
We'll come and go as we like.
No you won't! Because this window is closing!
That's a lie. How can it close?
But for that, I would have gone there when still young.
Tell us when it closes.
- I will not!
-You will!
No!
Vera, get the scissors!
We'll cut off the kitty's balls.
Don't you dare! Let the cat go.
I ask for the last time: when?
We'll cut them off!
Very well, you monsters...
Read this. The exact dates are marked.
- Run! The window is closing!
- What do you mean, closing?
Paris is closing, blockhead!
- How do you know?
-The old woman said so.
Her grandfather was a scientist.
He worked it all out.
See this rain.There wasn't a cloud in sight in the daytime.
All as the old woman said.
Just wait till midnight strikes.
- How long will that be?
- I don't know exactly.
That's all humbug.
You'll see when it closes.
- When will it open again?
- In 20 years.
In 20 years, we'll be too old for Paris.
- Get closer to the windows.
- I can manage myself.
- You'll fall, you idiot.
-Take care you don't fall.
- Where'd you put the tank?
- I gave it to Mum.
And the hind wheel, too.
What are you doing here, Kolia?
I don't understand you...
Your chum decided to emigrate.
The sort of friends you have!
Drag it away before they catch you in the act.
At least, we're not traitors like you.
That's an offence. Motorcycles are common as mud in Paris.
They even dump cars, they got so fat at our expense.
Why at our expense?
Who do you think shielded them from the Golden Horde?
In the 200 years we kept it back they've been developing.
So you're just taking your due?
Precisely.
And it's OK to rob other people's tents? This is ours!
Let him use it.
We're generous people.
I'm giving you my room in exchange, may you choke on it.
Thanks for the room.
We may be poor, but we're ready to share our last kopeck.
Here, it's a cruel world.
No one will offer a hand in help.
Go to hell, you and your advice!
We'll go all right, but you'll remember your fatherland, when you lie dying under a hedge among the frog gobblers.
Kolia, get up!
The window is still open!
Where to with these?
Leave them where you found them.
Good day, Nikolai Nikolaevich!
Did you sleep well?
You didn't feel cold in your tent?
Nights are warm here.
- Mum! The colors will stain!
- Don't tell me what to do!
See the outdated spelling?
This was written before the revolution.
Exactly! They used a different calendar then.
So what?
When you celebrate the
Old New Year?
On the 1 3th...
Put those rags aside!
We only have 1 3 days ahead!
- 1 3? What do you mean?
- Round it off, Mum.
Silence! I'll read the Strike
Committee's declaration.
We, students of the Business
Lycee demand:
1 : Recommence the aesthetics classes.
2: That the canteen again serve doughnuts.
3: Permit smoking during recesses.
Nikolai Nikolaevich, I'm so glad that you're back among us.
Thank you, I no longer need money.
But if you could give me a French textbook...
- What do you mean?
- I need a textbook.
- For which year?
- For all of them.
But they've all been checked out.
We'll give you anything if you influence the kids.
I have a proposal that will suit everyone.
Withdraw your demands and attend classes.
I, on my part, will arrange a fantastic excursion.
Where to?
To a place you've never been to and aren't likely to see.
To a place you've never been to and aren't likely to see.
Vera! Hold on to the money.
Stop them!
Hey! Are you out of your mind?
Let go of me, you damn monkey!
- Hallo!
- Stop them.
What are you doing on my roof?
Clear out before I have them put you behind bars.
Madame, may I make your akwiance?
- What?
- Acquaintance.
- You cretin.
- Why?
Please come in. make yourself comfortable.
I'll go fetch your pet.
There...
I thought this will liven things up a bit.
"The Afternoon of a Faun", so to speak...
Faun! She was a virgin.
It was an unfortunate way of putting it...
I meant "Diana Resting after the Hunt".
Adele couldn't hurt a fly.
She was a noble creature.
But surely she rested from time to time.
But not in this loose position.
She was very modest.
- I'm so tired of idiots!
- What?
Get your ugly mugs out of here.
I need a Russian-French phrasebook and Russian swear words dictionary.
There! You thought we'd be playing in orchestras here.
You were wrong.
Nobody here wants art. Nobody!
Come on, you're exaggerating.
Just look at these fat chops.
Those are the French for you.
Thick as planks.
- Surely not all of them.
- All.
No, really.
What about Voltaire or Bizet?
As thick as the rest of them.
Shrimp with lemon.
We know: "The mighty French culture...
...fertilized the Russian culture."
It was we who fertilized them.
We filled their void...
...with profound meaning and now stand in awe of them!
I don't agree with you.
No? See those people sitting behind us?
You know what their conversation is about?
It's about the food they're stuffing in.
And you remember how we...
...in a communal flat on Lenin square, on the kitchen table...
... a bottle of vodka and one pickle...
And we talked about fine arts,
Motherland's fate, about God.
Oh, well...
Gorokhov!
What are you doing?
What do you need a piano for on the roof?
I'm going to give concerts, stupid.
- Bought for hard currency?
- No, for your pretty eyes.
Who gave you the right to spend
Convertible currency on yourself?
On myself, huh? Who'd you think
I bought this for? You!
Mum, to think I wasted my life on him!
- Wretched parasite!
- You old prostitute!
Me ask no noise. Me call police.
No noise. Call police.
Madame! Pardon, don't call the police!
When you deal with your wife, you beat up her face, but when it comes to a French tart, it's "Pardon!"
Madame! Everything will be OK!
Yves Montand! C'est la vie!
Peace, friendship! Pardon, merci!
- Who took down our lines?
- Who needs your rags?
I know who needs them.
I'll sort her out now!
Vera, please stop it!
She's already on her way over.
There'll be trouble...
We're not saying a word.
Slut, idiot, tart!
You be scoundrel, fool, bastard, shit, bandit!
Is that so? I'll show you!
You know what this is?
Stop! Stop!
At last we've found it!
The church, the bar, and the ladder!
It's the wrong church... and the wrong bar.
They're robbing someone.
There's just as much shit here as back home. Let's go!
You say: look at the dirt, the poverty, the boorishness.
You're right, on the one hand.
On the other... Take me:
I have everything: a car, a flat, a job, a family.
But I have an ache here.
The farther, the worse.
I've been here. And Australia, the Hawaii, Florida and Japan.
So what?
It's just the same as watching it on TV in Petersburg.
But when I sat bare-assed in my communal flat, and couldn't even dream of all this, somewhere deep inside
I was much richer!
So many plans!
I was bursting with ideas!
Then go back there!
- If it were that simple!
- It's very simple.
It's no occasion for irony.
I swear, I'd give up all: France,
Australia, car and coat, if you'd return to me my Nevsky
Prospect and communal flat!
But give it back this very moment!
Will you be satisfied if it's in half an hour's time?
- Well, I'm blowed!
- Straight ahead.Turn left.
Careful, there are steps here.
Why such a stench?
Are we in a loo?
It's a surprise.
Especially for you.
A nice surprise but too stinky.
- Which way?
- It makes no difference.
It makes a difference to me.
Zip along Nevsky, past
Field of Mars, then turn right...
- Along Fontanka?
- No.
Along Mokhovaya, to our local little pub!
Then left, and step on it till you get to the end.
- Is he just out of a madhouse?
- He's just over from Paris.
- Is everyone a nut over there?
- All without exception.
Get out. We've arrived.
Take off your blindfold.
Recognize it?
So long, and good luck!
Stop!
News bulletin.
Democracy is upon us, bringing to the sacred banks of the Neva not merely foreign traders, but foreign gangsters as well.
Two criminals were arrested while breaking into a flat...
That's them, the foul parasites!
They maintain, in broken French, that they are citizens of France.
They are, more over, unable to explain their presence in Petersburg.
They'll pay for it.
Not so fast. What about Lenin Square and your communal flat?
To hell with all that!
- Stop the idle talk!
- I've already stopped.
- You'll find me a job.
- No problem.
Get up! Cover your eyes!
Cover them properly! Let's go!
Stop!
Careful! Don't scratch it!
I don't need to be told.
What are you doing there?
Gorokhov!
I'm coming down.
- You bet you are!
- What's the matter?
Your French tart has chopped the ladder.
What am I going to do?
Mother Russia, I'll never see you again!
Madame, can I help you?
Gorokhov! Get me out of here!
Well, are you satisfied now?
-This is not Adele.
- What do you mean?
A grey angora with spots, white bib, blue eyes...
That's it. The eyes!
She has a frivolous look.
Adele's eye were chaste and meek.
She was a virgin, just like me.
Perhaps the light's not quite right.
I'll open the window and you'll see.
Let us through.
You gang of bastards!
You'll pay for this!
Go to hell!
She thinks we can fly.
Excuse me.
They look even more depraved in this light.
My Adele, you know, had meek and gentle eyes...
You be scoundrel, fool, bastard, tart!
Mesdames! Messieurs!
By" Red October"factory's pianos, the sturdiest!
- You'd do better if you played.
- Right.
Congratulations. We'll take you.
But I should warn you, we're no "Moulin Rouge".
We believe in serious art.
Our club was founded almost 300 years ago, and we have traditions you will have to reckon with.
To start with: stop smoking.
No smoking here.
Second, take off your trousers.
Why?
Clear enough. Take off your trousers.
If you don't, you'll lose the job.
Can't you show your legs?
6 sections in all.
- Height?
- 2.5 meters.
- Too low.
- Banks use them.
But you don't know these people.
If you insist, we can put in electronic eyes.
Anything crossing the beam sets off the electronic defense, triggering either high voltage electric shock or a blast of neuro-paralytic gas.
- Could I have both?
- Certainly.
And I'd also like a row of spikes on top.
- Smeared with poison?
- Is it possible?
Madame, you've seen too many horror films and are over-dramatizing the situation.
So. For physical injuries we'll confiscate the telephone.
For moral damage, we'll take the bird.
Hey, thief!
Give back my things immediately.
Stop and give back my things, that's an order!
All right, we've had our little joke, but there's a limit.
Open the door, you bastards! Thieves!
This time, you won't get away with it!
I've had enough.
I'm going to the police.
You'll remember me!
You'll keep out cold.
Messieurs!
There are toilets for that!
Madame, tell me, which district is this?
She's ill!
PART II
Cheers!
Hands off Lenin!
Remember, Russia always rested on three whales:
God, Tsar, and Fatherland.
Ma'am, save Russia! Keep her from hands of Jews and Masons!
Sign in support of our deputy!
RUSSIA IS FOR THE RUSSIANS!
How much is the chicken?
Hey, girl, is the dressing gown for sale?
You're a foreigner! Are you cold?
What are you doing naked in such weather?
Come home with me, we'll get warm.
Watch the step.
She's with me. My bird.
Careful, there's a piss on the floor.
Sit down.
What a beauty! Who is she?
Keep your hands off.
She's a foreigner.
Get out of here!
What are you shivering for?
We'll get warm now.
Cheers!
No, drink it all. Bottoms up!
Feel that? Sure!
Are you getting warmer?
What a nice gown you've got.
You're nice, too.
And your bird is nice, too.
I like your gown and the hat.
They were yours.
Now they're mine.
C'est la vie!
Your tails, monsieur!
-Thank you very much!
- No trouble.
- Monsieur, and the trousers?
- No trousers.
I won't play Mozart trouser-less!
No one here wants to see
Mozart in trousers.
-Then I won't play at all.
-Then you'll die under the hedge.
Let me die, but with my trousers on.
That's your Russian prudery for you!
You all play at being saints, being in fact a bunch of thieves.
Vodka and foul language - that's your moral code.
You say one thing, do another, think yet another!
You're shit!
Messieurs, you speak French?
Help me!
Wait for me!
I'm coming!
I'm French, just like you.
Let me through! I must speak to my fellow countrymen!
I must go home!
Leave me alone!
You little bitch!
No, no I'll show you "monsieur".
I beg you, let me go home.
I'll allow you free passage through my flat.
Police?
This is the place, lads,
I've found it.
Look: here's the house, the wall, the grill, the church.
And where's the fire escape ladder?
There are thousands of such places in Paris!
-Then I don't know...
- But I know!
Madame, excuse me,
I must get through.
Hello. Come in,
I've no time to waste.
Lower it down here.
Over to the left.
That's it!
Look, there're some books!
Get in, granny!
And you said we'd never lift her up! We did!
What a car!
A"Citroen Cabriolet".
- Look at those lights! Halogens!
- Where's the French girl?
- I'm serious. Where is she?
- Your dame's in Petersburg.
Gorokhov sent her there for re-education.
I always carry it close to my heart,
I'll die with it.
I always carry it close to my heart,
I'll die with it.
In these hard times, when our Party has been forced underground we have fought our way here to fellow French comrades:
The Party still lives!
Our way to you was hard and full of deprivation.
Our delegation was exposed to cold and famine.
But communists never give up!
And extending to you our hand in friendship, and adhering to the principles of proletarian internationalism, we exhort you to pay our taxi!
Long live international solidarity of workers!
Long live everlasting friendship between our parties!
No pasaran!
8500 francs?
You've really come straight from Moscow?
No, from Leningrad.
Have a look...
It's her! Edith Piaf!
Here's a book about her.
Help me get out of here.
Don't leave me here,
I beg you!
I want to go home!
Don't do that. Get up!
What are you doing? Calm down.
See what you've done to the famous artiste?
- She's got a concert today.
- Well, what of it?
You think she can go out on stage in this condition?
- Where's her concert?
- In a concert hall...
- Which one?
-The "October".
Find "October" phone number.
- And who might you be?
- Mme. Piaf's interpreter.
I double as the pianist.
-Your documents, please.
- How could I have them?
I'm in my concert dress,
I don't even have pockets.
"October" Hall? Lt. Vragov,
20th Police station, speaking.
Do you have Edith Piaf performing today?
You do? With whom? Who?
With Elvis Presley?
Well, we have them both down here at the station.
I'll pass the word.
Greetings to you both.
- We are free to go?
- Free to go?
We have criminal proceedings against your artiste.
For assault of an officer on duty and material damages.
What damages?
See this broken cap.
This offence calls for arrest.
Don't you realize that a concert with Edith Piaf is worth more than Petersburg's entire Police Force?
Splendid! Then let her pay for material, and, especially, moral damages. Hard currency.
I'll find out in a minute.
Madame Piaf...
Have you been taking drugs?
Madame Piaf has agreed to pay in goods.
What goods?
Video, TV set, washing machine, cigarettes...
Can we have two videos?
I can't read item 1 7 here.
- Uev or Muev...
- Captain Chuev.
- 2 cassette recorders and a hair-drier. - Thank you.
Petrenko will take you to your hotel.
Madam Piaf invites you to her concert.
Hallo. Who are you escorting?
- French Artists.
- What are the names?
Edith Piaf and Elvis Presley.
And you, I suppose, must be Fyodor Chaliapin?
-Petrenko! Where are the artists?
-In the car.
Artists, my foot!
I want these criminals brought to the station.
In case of resistance, we use weapons.
Easy now! Get out of the car!
Only don't shoot!
Quick, shut the door!
Madame, let's go!
Step on it!
Petrenko! Why don't you reply?
I order you to reply.
Go to hell, I've had enough of you.
Answer according to Regulations!
I've shot them.
Shot them?
But you don't have any bullets.
And you don't have any brain, you idiot
It's not Petrenko!
All highway and police cars!
Stop police car No...
Your card, Madam!
Let's see your card!
Leave her alone.
She's a foreigner.
What about your ticket?
Are you also a foreigner?
I could be a foreigner, too!
None of them have a conscience.
It's that insolent breed.
They've got money for restaurants.
I know their kind!
Keep calm, citizens.
We'll soon get off.
- And who'll pay your fare?
- Get them out of here!
Who will put this country to order?!
- I'm Nikolai!
- I'm Nicole!
At long last!
We've waited long enough.
We were worried.
You tell him, Vera.
You ran off with the club's costume.
That wasn't nice.
Dinner's ready. We have an occasion to celebrate.
You won't believe your eyes.
See what a beauty...
So soft and comfortable.
Just feel the suspension!
A"Citroen"!
Time to take your medicine.
Drink this.
Why give her shit to drink!
It's full of synthetic nitrates.
Try this! 7 6 per cent, made with natural herbs!
See how it spreads through the system. Let's try it, too.
Your health!
Best of all, give her a rub down.
- What do you mean?
- Strip her, then rub.
I'll give you such a rub down you'll crawl to the ceiling.
She's ill, poor thing!
And hungry...
- Come to our place for a bite and drink.
- Our table's loaded.
Can't you see, she won't come.
Leave her alone.
She doesn't have to, if she doesn't want to.
If the mountain won't come to Mohammed,
Mohammed goes to the mountain.
Kolya, you have callers.
Greetings, Nikolai Nikolaevich!
- We've come.
-That's wonderful.
And what next?
You promised to take us to a place we've never been to.
Come on then!
Do you think they're taking us to lunch?
Comrades, in 1 5 minutes we'll be at Pere Lachaise.
What are perlachaise?
It's a famous restaurant.
Like "Maxim's".
Nikolai Nikolaevich, how do you say in French
"a window to Paris"?
"A window to Paris"?
Let's see...
Kolya, we've found them!
"We haven't eaten in six days."
Right, the concert's over, time to go home.
Don't you understand? Home!
The window is closing.
Well, let it close.
It won't open again for 20 years.
Got it?
- Got it.
- Let's go then.
- We've decided to stay.
- You what?
We've decided to stay.
What do you mean, "decided to stay"?
How can you decide?
Grow up first, then decide.
I'll decide for you meanwhile.
Come on!
Fine. You've decided to stay.
What about your parents?
It's all the better for them.
Fewer problems with food.
You're a bunch of fools.
They love you. They worry.
They think something has happened to us.
But we've written to them.
When they learn we're in Paris, of course, they'll be glad.
Then we'll invite them over and they'll have a good time.
Nastya! What about your granny?
She'll die without you.
Don't play on her feelings.
Her granny's sick because she doesn't have good medicine.
But we'll buy her medicine here and she'll get better.
And the money? Where's the money going to come from?
See this?
We've earned 248 francs already.
The French are kind people.
They won't abandon children.
They're kind, but you won't always be children.
Do you plan to spend your lives sponging on them?
Why our whole lives?
We'll find other work.
- Dishwashing...
- Or washing cars...
-There's plenty of occupations.
- What do you mean?
Beauty has its value everywhere.
Clever girl.
You ought to be ashamed.
Your teacher gave you a treat and the thanks he gets.
He's in the hospital because of you.
You're cruel, ungrateful children.
Very well. You're right.
You were born at the wrong time, in a miserable bankrupt country.
But it's your country.
Can't you make it a better place?
You could do much, believe me.
But you haven't even tried.
Don't you really care?
- And you?
- I do.
Then why have you decided to stay here?
Who said I'm staying?
No, thanks, I don't want to spoil my appetite.
Look!
-That's Gorokhov's neighbor.
- Kolya...
- Stop! Wait!
- Kolya! It's us!
Open the door, do you hear me!
Gorokhov, dear! Come for my sake!
The window's closing!
Insensitive creature.
Let them say goodbye!
Contact the Russian embassy.
They'll help their countrymen.
The hell they need you!
No passport, no money...
We can't get along without the French communists.
We're fed up to there with that party!
Give me that thing, please.
I have a brilliant idea.
Hands up!
Where to?
To Petersburg!
What are you standing there for?
Give me a hand!

The End
Christchurch...
New Zealand's city
of the plains.
Here, when spring comes
to Canterbury,
daffodils bloom gay
and golden
in the woodland
of Hagley Park.
Through the park,
tree-bordered, green-banked,
the Avon flows,
a small and placid stream.
The riverbank is cool
and green,
a quiet haven from the bustle
of the city.
Nearby are tall buildings,
busy streets,
and the heart of the city,
Cathedral Square.
Every city street is flat,
so there are bicycles
everywhere.
This is a city of cycling.
Mothers, fathers, sons,
and daughters all on wheels...
cyclists of all ages
from 8 to 80 ride to play
or work each day.
There are thousands of them,
and only Copenhagen
is said to boast more bicycles.
Canterbury University
College...
weathered gray stone buildings,
shadowed cloisters.
It was here Lord Rutherford
began a great career.
The girls' high school stands
in Cranmer Square,
and not far away are
the broad acres of Hagley Park,
with playing fields
for many sports.
In spring, summer, and autumn,
Christchurch gardens are gay
and colored.
Yes, Christchurch,
New Zealand's city
of the plains.
Mummy!
Mummy!
Mummy!
It's Mummy!
She's terribly hurt!
Please... help us!

The imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past.
He wanted her to give him the money.
Translate, somebody.
Quickly.
He wanted her to give him some money.
Put up your hand.
I will not have girls talking out of turn in my class.
Good morning, girls.
Good morning, Miss Stewart.
Sit.
Miss Waller, class... this is Juliet Hulme.
Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret,
and prior to that,
she spent some time
at Queenswood
in the Hawkes Bay.
I am actually from England,
Miss Stewart.
Of course.
Juliet's father is
Dr. Hulme, rector of Canterbury College.
Juliet has traveled all over the world.
And I'm sure she's very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the girls of 3A.
Hmm. Well, I'll leave you to it,
Miss Waller.
Juliet.
You can
sit over here, Juliet.
We use French names in this class.
You can choose your own.
Now, irregular verbs
in the present subjunctive...
I doubted... that he would come.
Excuse me, Miss Waller.
You've made a mistake.
"I doubted that he would come" is, in fact, the spoken subjunctive.
It is customary to stand when addressing a teacher...
Antoinette.
You should have written
"came."
I- I must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.
You don't need to apologize,
Miss Waller.
I found it frightfully difficult myself until I got the hang of it.
Thank you, Juliet.
Open your textbook to page 17.
Right, I thought we'd do some life drawing today, so why don't you pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw?
Oh, Juliet, you haven't got a partner.
Oh, that's all right,
Mrs. Collins.
I'm sure I can manage without one.
Pauline, are you with anybody?
Good.
You can come up here
and pair up with Juliet.
Draw some heavier lines there.
You might want to
change the color.
Make it a bit darker.
That's very nice,
Joanne.
Good heavens, Juliet.
What on Earth is this?
St. George and the dragon.
Where's Pauline?
Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet.
I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out of room.
Sorry.
I don't know if you've
noticed, Mrs. Collins, but I've actually drawn
St. George in the likeness of the world's greatest tenor,
Mario Lanza.
Yes, I know.
It's very clever, Juliet.
But when I set you a topic,
I expect you to follow it.
Now, put that down and start again.
I think your drawing's fantastic.
Ooh. Mackerel.
Well, we'll have them for lunch tomorrow.
Oh, let's have them now while they're fresh, eh, Honora?
Well,
I think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss isn't too keen on seafood, and I've got lamb chops in the refrigerator.
Excuse me.
Would you mind if I put my new long-playing record on?
You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, Steve?
Uh, well, actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.
Oh, you have been
splashing out.
Oh, it's all right!
I've got my board money.
Hello.
Well? Tell us.
How'd you go?
Got an "A," Mum.
Oh, don't worry about it now.
We'll sort it out after dinner.
You go and put your record on.
Doris Day.
I think she's really talented.
Got to be quick in this house, mate.

Can I have another look?
One...
Lift those legs high,
girls,
keeping those legs straight.
One...
That's so impressive.
Can I touch it?
Carry on now.
You're doing well.
I've got scars.
They're on my lungs.
I spent months in bed during the war, ravaged by respiratory illness.
Mummy and Daddy sent me
to the Bahamas to recuperate.
I didn't see them
for five years.
But we're together now,
and Mummy's promised
they'll never leave me again.
I spent ages in
hospital, too, with my leg.
I had to have
all these operations.
Osteomyelitis turns
your bones to chalk.
Took them two years to drain all the muck out.
Cheer up.
All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases.
It's all frightfully romantic.
Oh! Hi, Paul!
The evil Prince Runnymede is escaping!
Get him, Paul!
Faster!
Come on!
The blighter's gone to ground!
Oh, God, Jonesy!
Jonesy, stop it!
Leave her alone, you rotten little turd!
But she's an invader!
Go away.
We're not playing anymore.
Go on.
Bugger off.
You said a swearword.
I'm telling Mummy on you.
And I'm going into your bedroom to break every one of your toys.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters!
It's Mario.
What on Earth are these?
They're egg-and-salmon sandwiches, and I gave them to you several days ago.
Yeah, I thought
I could smell sulfur.
God, Henry.
You're hopeless!
Can't be trusted with anything as simple as lunch.
Mother!
Oh... hello.
Mother, Jonesy broke
Paul's record!
Oh, dear.
We must buy her another one.
Would you like a cup of tea... Paul?
Um, no, thank you.
Well, Juliet's told us
all about you.
I hear you're very fond
of opera.
Now, which one shall we play?
Juliet, your father
is trying to study.
Daddy can study while we're playing records.
Why don't you go back outside, hmm?
I'll be finished soon.
# Hiya-a-a-a-a-a #
# Hiya-a-a-a-a-a-a #
# There's a song in the air #
# But the fair seÃ±orita
doesn't seem to care #
# For the song in the air #
# So I'll sing to the mule #
# If you're sure
she won't think #
# That I am just a fool
serenading a mule #
# Amigo mÃ­o, does she not have
a dainty bray? #
# She listens carefully
to each little tune you play #
# A bÃ¨lla seÃ±orita #
# SÃ­, sÃ­, mi muchachito #
# She'd love to sing it, too,
if only she knew the way #
# But try as she may #
# In her voice there's a flaw #
# And all
that the lady can say #
Mario!
# Is "Heeha-a-a-a-a-w" #
# SeÃ±orita donkey-cita
not so fleet as a mosquito #
# But so sweet
like my Chiquita #
# You're the one for me #
# There's a light
in her eyes... #
Paul!
Oh, God!
Paul, are you all right?!
I... I think...
I'm dying.
Don't!
Please.
Please don't!
Paul!
You've been eating onions!
You toad!
# There's a light
in her eyes #
# Though she may try
to hide it #
# She cannot deny
there's a light in her eyes #
# The charm of her smile
so beguiles Don Diego #
# That he rode a mile
for the charm of her smile #
- Waaaa!
- Wheeee!
# Her face is a dream #
# Like an angel I saw... #
# But all
that my darling can scream #
# Is "Heeha-a-a-a-a-a-w" #

OlÃ©!
Oh, I wish James Mason
would do a religious picture.
He'd be perfect as Jesus.
Daddy says the Bible is a load of bunkum.
But we're all going to Heaven.
I'm not.
I'm going to the Fourth World.
It's sort of like Heaven, only better, because there aren't any Christians.
It's an absolute paradise of music, art, and pure enjoyment.
James will be there, and Mario, only they'll be saints.
St. Mario.
To be known... as "He."
"He."
"Him."
"Him."
"This."
"This."
"That."
"That."
"It."
Absolutely not!
Orson Welles!
The most hideous man alive!
We... give praise... to the saints.
Saints.
Oh, wonderful, Mum!
I got
me self a pair of socks!
Oh, Wendy. Oh.
Oh, thanks.
From Dad.
Mario Lanza!
Oh, thanks, Yvonne.
I hope it's all right.
It's from
Whitcombe & Tombs.
I decided
that my New Year's resolution
is to be more lenient
with others.
Pikelets! Yum!
Aren't you going out?
Not until 2:30.
This is a private function.
Go away!
Oh! Come on.
- Sausage rolls.
- Come on through.
Look who I found.
Hello... Juliet.
Hello, Mrs. Rieper.
It's so nice to meet you.
And so,
in a blazing fury,
Charles runs
Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword, leaving
Deborah free to accept
Charles' proposal of marriage.
I've heard your mother on 3 YA.
The Women's Session has lots of lively debate.
Well, actually,
Mummy's left that program now.
She's far too busy with the Marriage Guidance Council.
They sound like a queer mob.
Dad.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger.
Oh, no.
Mummy's awfully good at it.
She has deep discussions
with unhappy couples
and persuades them to give it
another go.
In two years,
she's only had four divorces.
She should really be working
for the U.N.
My wife's blaming me.
Says it's all my fault.
And how do you feel about that, Mr. Perry?
Please... call me Bill.
I don't know what went wrong.
My wife feels that, uh...
Oh, no. No.
Let's talk about your feelings... Bill.
Mummy's got a special technique
called "deep therapy."
What's that?
I'm not sure, but it's proving to be very popular.
Mmm.
Eat up, Yvonne.
It's my middle name.
Yvonne tells us you're...
you're good at making models.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Well, we're... we're pretty handy with the old model making, too, eh?
I've never cottoned on
to plasticine like you girls,
but I enjoy making
anything out of wood.
Oh. Are you a carpenter,
Mr. Rieper?
I work at Dennis Brothers... fish supply.
He's the manager.
This is the dining room.
Do excuse us.
Um, breakfast is between
7:00 and 9:00.
The bedrooms are small, but they're very clean and comfortable.
This, um,
this story of yours... perhaps the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Actually, Mr. Rieper, it's a novel.
And we'll be sending it to New York.
That's where all the big
publishing houses are based.
Is that a fact?
Well, you'd better put me name down for an advance copy.
We have decided
how sad it is for other people
that they cannot appreciate
our genius,
but we hope the book
will help them
to do so a little,
though no one
could fully appreciate us.
# How much is that doggie
in the window #
Woof, woof.
# The one with
the waggly tail? #
# How much is that doggie
in the window? #
- Oh, go on.
- Woof, woof.
# I do hope
that doggie's for sale #
California,

# I must take a trip

Charles clutches
his wounded shoulder
- As he gallops into the courtyard!
Deborah awaits his return in their private boudoir
at the very top
of the tower!
He smells her scent
from 50 paces
and urges his steed
onward!
He flings open the door
and launches himself
at the bed,
ravishing her!
Oh, God, yes!
I bet she gets up the duff on their first night together.
What's "up the duff"?
Something
you wouldn't understand.
Tell me!
I'm almost 10!
You're 81/2
and incredibly stupid!
Mummy...
Paul and I have decided that Charles and Deborah are going to have a baby, an heir to the throne of Borovnia.
What a splendid idea.
We're calling him
Diello.
Well, that's a good dramatic name.
Paul thought it up.
Aren't you clever?
Hmm.
There... all done.
Oh, look at you two...
A couple of Borovnian Princesses
If ever I saw them.
My daughter... and my... foster daughter.
Hilda,
I can't find that letter from the High Commission.
They want
our passport numbers.
Are you going abroad,
Daddy?
Your father's attending a university conference in England, darling.
We'll only be gone for a few weeks.
You're not going, are you, Mummy?
Well, yes,
I-I thought I might.
It's, uh, a long time for your father and I to be apart.
But I should go, too.
Darling, you've got school.
You've only just settled in.
B- But...
Who's coming to the shops?
Me! I'm coming!
I need some cigarettes.
Put on your shoes,
Jonathon!
Julie!
Julie!
Julie!
Julie!
Look, Paul!
What?
- Look!
- What?
Oh, it's so beautiful.
What?!
Oh, it's so beautiful!
Pretty flowers.
Come with me!
It's all right.
You'll see.
Come on!
Come on!
Look!
Today
Juliet and I discovered
the key to the Fourth World.
We have had it
in our possession
for about six months,
but we only realized it
on the day
of the death of Christ.
We saw a gateway
through the clouds.
Everything
was full of peace and bliss.
We then realized
we had the key.
We now know we're not genii,
as we thought.
We have an extra part
of our brain
that can appreciate
the Fourth World.
Only about 10 people have it.
When we die, we will go
to the Fourth World,
but meanwhile,
on two days every year,
we may use the key
and look into
that beautiful world
which we have been lucky enough
to be allowed to know of
on this day
of finding the key
to the way
through the clouds.
Push!
It's coming!
Oh, God!
It's a boy!
Deborah...
We have a son and heir.
I shall call him Diello!
Oh, you're such an incredible woman!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
The empress Deborah has the most enormous difficulty fending off her husband, who tries to have his way with her morning, noon, and night.
Thank you, Juliet.
However...
the queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello, who has proven to be an uncontrollable little blighter who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him!
That's enough, Juliet!
I suppose this is your idea of a joke!
No, Mrs. Stevens.
I suppose you think it witty and clever to mock the royal family,
to poke fun at the queen
and the empire with this... rubbish!
It's not rubbish!
Sit down, Pauline!
I really don't understand why you are so upset,
Mrs. Stevens.
I merely wrote an essay on the royal family, as requested.
It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors!
Sit down!
A girl like you should be
setting an example.
To your seat.
Stop it, Juliet!
Mrs. Hulme told me
they had found out today
that Juliet has tuberculosis
on one lung.
Poor Juliet.
I nearly fainted
when I heard.
I had a terrible job
not to cry.
I spent a wretched night.
It would be wonderful
if I could get
tuberculosis, too.
Come on, sit up.
I'm not hungry.
Oh, Yvonne, you've got to eat.
You hardly ate any dinner last night.
Now, come on.
I'm not having you falling ill.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Well, you may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't.
All right.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Juliet's infectious.
She'll be going to the hospital.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Well, her parents won't be going overseas now.
They have to cancel
their trip.
Don't worry about Juliet.
Well, it's not too late to cancel our travel arrangements, if that's what you want.
I'm sure you'll like it here.
It's very tranquil.
Oh, I've spoken to the matron.
She promises to take extra special care of you.
And you can carry on
with your studies
while you convalesce.
It's for the good of your health, darling.
Cheer up, old thing, hmm?
Four months... fly by in no time.
Juliet
won't be allowed visitors
for at least
a couple of months, dear.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray just to be on the safe side.
I thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday.
Anybody
want to give me a hand?
You used to love making
things with Dad, Yvonne.
This evening,
I had a brain wave
that Juliet and I
should write to each other
as Charles and Deborah.
I wrote a six-page letter
as Charles
and a two-page letter
as Paul.
She has entered into
the spirit of the thing
greatly.
"My dear Charles,
"I miss you and adore you
in equal amounts
"and long for the day
that we will be reunited.
"But as I languish here
in this house of disease
"and decrepitude,
"my mind turns
with increasing frequency
"to the problem of our son.
"Although only 10,
"Diello has thus far killed
57 people
"and shows no desire to stop.
It worries me, Charles. "
"My dearest,
darling, Deborah,
"affairs of state
continue to occupy my time.
"I have to report
"that the lower classes
are terrifically dull.
"Only yesterday,
"I was compelled to execute
several peasants
"just to alleviate
the boredom.
"Diello insisted
on coming along.
"In fact,
he made such a fuss
"that I had to let him
wield the ax himself.
"Heads did roll...
"not just the prisoners
"but the royal guard,
my valet,
"and several
unfortunate onlookers
copped it as well. "
"Oh, Charles,
I am despaired enough
"to put Diello
in the hands of the cardinal
"in the hope
that a good dose of religion
will set the young chap
on the right path. "
Hello again.
How are you getting on?
It must be awfully hard being away from your school chums.
I've got something here that you might just like to have a look at.
Unfortunately, the miracles of modern medicine can only go so far in combating an illness like TB.
That's why I'm here,
because...
Reach out, Juliet!
Reach out for Jesus!
Yvonne!
Yvonne!
Paul!
Paul!
I'm so happy to see you!
Don't get too close.
She's still not 100%.
Hello, Juliet.
Hello!
We brought you some fruit.
Oh, thank you so much!
Your letters are wonderful, Charles!
Well, that's, um, coming along nicely.
Oh, I'm the matron's favorite patient, and she showed me her special stitch.
I love the color.
It's for you.
Goodness, me, what a lot of letters.
Ha. Are your parents enjoying their trip?
Oh, there's a couple of unopened ones.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
They sent me off to the Bahamas for the good of my health.
They sent me off to the Bay of bloody Islands for the good of my health!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper.
I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Well, we don't want to tire you out, dear.
Oh, can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
No, we've got a tram to catch, Yvonne.
Bye.
You know,
this is quite something.
You're damn clever.
So, Deborah is married to Charles, and this chap Nicholas is her tennis instructor?
Yes, but there's nothing between them.
Deborah would never go for a commoner.
Nicholas has got his eye on Gina,
an amazingly beautiful
gypsy.
Looks like you, Yvonne.
Juliet made it.
This is really quite incredible.
I'd bet you girls know the entire royal lineage for the last five centuries.
Oh, yes, it's all worked out.
You'll never guess what's happened.
What?
John has fallen in love with me!
That idiot boarder?
Yes!
How do you know?
Did he tell you?
Well, uh, no, but it's so obvious.
Is that why you haven't replied to my last letter?
No, silly.
I'm only teasing.
He's only a stupid boy.
Yvonne.
What do you want?
I can't sleep.
Can I borrow a book?
Shut the door.
This looks interesting.
Some of these knitting patterns look damn complicated.
Have you tried the tea cozy?
It's damn cold, isn't it?
Do you think I could hop into bed just for a minute... just to warm up?
My feet
are like ice blocks.
Well, you should've worn your slippers.
Come on, Yvonne,
I'll catch my death.
Tsk.
Just for a minute.
To think
that so much could happen
in so little time
caused by so few.
A terrible tragedy
has occurred.
"No, girls, it isn't 'O,' it's 'E'!"
And she goes, "Eee!"
As if someone was jabbing a pen into her.
Silly old trout.
I love you, Yvonne.
And then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes,
"And Charles II
"met Nell Gwyn aboard a boat,
"and he was a wealthy, young prince,
"and she was a pretty, young thing, and these things do happen."
God, it's no wonder
I don't excel in history.
Do you love me as much as I love you?
Of course, my darling, Nicholas.
My... my name's John.
Well, I like "Nicholas" much better.
You can call me anything you like.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Oh, bloody hell!
Go to the house.
You've broken my heart,
Yvonne.
I lay there mesmerized.
It was just too frightful
to believe.
When I got up,
I found Father
had told Mother.
Coming to Lancaster Park
today, Mr. Rieper?
Oh, where's John?
He said he'd walk with me.
John is no longer staying here.
Shot through this morning, said his old mom had taken sick.
I had a nasty,
foreboding feeling at first,
but now I realized
my crime was too frightful
for an ordinary lecture.
From now on, you are sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this kind of behavior, you've got another think coming!
You're only 14!
You're a child!
What on Earth is the matter with you, Yvonne?
You know what can happen with boys.
Don't you have any self-respect?!
Can I go now?
Oh, you think you're such a clever little madam!
You had your father in tears last night!
My God, what a disgrace you are.
You shame me.
You shame the family.
You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
Well, I guess
I take after you, then!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17!
Nana Parker told me!
You're going to be late.
I'm terribly cut up.
I miss Nicholas
terrifically.
Mother thinks I will have
nothing more to do with him,
but little she knows.
Nicholas was pleased
that I was so early.
We sat around and talked
for an hour
and then went to bed.
I declined the invitation
at first,
but he became
very masterful,
and I had no option.
I discovered that
I had not lost my virginity
on Thursday night.
However, there is no doubt
whatsoever
that I have now.

Yvonne.
Yvonne.
I didn't hurt you, did I?
I've got to go home.
I love you so much.
Oh, Pauline!
- Daddy!
- Daddy!
There, living among
two beautiful daughters.
Of a man who possesses
two beautiful daughters,
you cannot know
nor yet try to guess
the sweet soothingness
of their caress.
The outstanding genius
of this pair
is understood by few,
they are so rare.
Beautiful boy!
Mummy!
Oh, darling!
Hello. Welcome home.
Yvonne!
Stop!
I still love you!
Compared with these
two, every man is a fool.
The world is most honored
that they should deign to rule,
and I worship the power
of these lovely two
with that adoring love
known to so few.
Yvonne!
Ah... pretty.
'Tis indeed
a miracle one must feel
that two such
heavenly creatures are real.
Both sets of eyes,
though different far,
hold many mysteries strange,
and passively,
they watch the race of men
decay and change.
Hatred burning bright
in the brown eyes
with enemies for fuel.
Icy scorn
glitters in the gray eyes,
contemptuous and cruel.
And why are men such fools
they will not realize
the wisdom
that is hidden
behind those strange eyes?
And these wonderful people
are you and I.
Mrs. Rieper, may I come in?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
An imaginative...
...and spirited girl.
Look, if she's spending too much time at your house, you only need to say.
All those nights that she spends over, she's assured us that you don't mind.
Uh, no. I-It's rather more complicated than that.
Since Mrs. Hulme and I have returned home,
Juliet's been behaving in a rather... disturbed manner...
Surliness, um, short temper, general irritability... most uncharacteristic.
You sure I can't tempt you
to a nice sherry, Dr. Hulme?
Uh, no, thank you.
The thing is...
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either... locking herself away in her room, endlessly writing.
My wife and I feel that the friendship is... unhealthy.
 No arguments
there, Dr. Hulme.
All that time inside working on those novels of theirs... they don't get any fresh air or exercise.
I'm not sure what you mean,
Dr. Hulme.
Your daughter... appears to have formed a rather... unwholesome attachment to Juliet.
What's she done?
She hasn't done anything.
It's the, um... it's the intensity of the friendship that concerns me.
I think we should avert trouble... before it starts.
Now...
Dr. Bennett's a good friend of mine.
He's a general physician, but he has some expertise in child psychology.
If Pauline is, indeed, developing in a rather...
...wayward fashion,
Dr. Bennett is the ideal man to set her back on track.
Dr. Bennett:
What about your studies?
Are you enjoying school?
Are you happy at home?
Answer Dr. Bennett,
Yvonne.
Yvonne...
Mrs. Rieper, perhaps you, uh, you wouldn't mind waiting outside, hmm?
Do you like your mother?
No.
And why is that?
She nags me.
And that's why you like to stay with the Hulmes.
Or is it because you want to be with Juliet?
Do you... like girls?
No.
Why not?
They're silly.
But Juliet's not silly.
No.
Yvonne, there's nothing wrong with having a close friend.
But sometimes things can get... too friendly.
Such associations can lead to trouble.
It isn't good to have just one friend.
My wife and I have several friends, and we enjoy seeing them on a regular basis, and it's all perfectly healthy.
Perhaps you could think about spending more time with... boys.
You don't want to hurt
Juliet's feelings, but I'm sure she'd understand your having other interests outside of the friendship.
I mean, there's all sorts of clubs and hobbies that you...
Bloody fool.
Uh, Mrs. Rieper... homosexuality.
I agree, Mrs. Rieper.
It's not a pleasant word.
But let us not panic unduly.
This condition is often a passing phase with girls of Yvonne's age.
But she's always been a normal... happy child.
Oh, it can strike at any time, and adolescents are particularly vulnerable.
What about the vomiting?
Uh, she's lost a lot of weight.
Physically,
I can find nothing wrong.
I've checked for TB, and she's clear.
I... I can only attribute her weight loss to her... mental disorder.
Look, Mrs. Rieper,
try not to worry too much.
Yvonne's young and strong,
and she's got a loving
family behind her.
Chances are
she'll grow out of it.
If not, well, medical science is progressing in leaps and bounds.
There... there could be a breakthrough at any time.
It was a rather snobbish
conception...
Mother woke me this morning
and started lecturing me
before I was properly awake,
which I thought was
somewhat unfair.
She has brought up the worst
possible threat now.
She said that if my health
did not improve,
I could never see the Hulmes
again.
The thought is too dreadful.
Life would be unbearable
without Deborah.
I wish I could die.
This is not an idle
or temporary impulse.
I have decided over the last
two or three weeks
that it would be the best thing
that could happen altogether,
and the thought of death
is not fearsome.
Oh, thank you!
Oh, Wendy.
I've got me self a pair of socks!
#... time has fled #
# And I die in despair... #
Is it hurting, dear?
Your leg.
Have you got pain?
# Never have I loved life
so dearly... #
My New Year's resolution
is a far more selfish one
than last year.
It is to make my motto,
"Eat, drink, and be merry,
for tomorrow you may be dead. "
Hi, Paul!
Hi, Paul!
Hi, Paul!
Ready...
Smile.
This arrived today,
Yvonne.
My name is Gina.
It's a letter from the school, from Miss Stewart.
What does Old Stu want?
She says the standard of your work is slipping.
At this rate, she doesn't think you'll get school certificate.
Who cares?
I care, and your father cares.
We want you to get a good education.
I'm educating myself.
You're failing English!
You used to be the top of the class!
I'm doing my own writing!
Don't think these stories are going to get you school certificate!
You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
What would you know?
You wouldn't know the first thing about writing!
You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're rude... rude and insolent!
And I don't think I should keep a horrid little child like you in school a minute longer.
I don't want to be in bloody school!
All right!
Well, you go out there!
You go out there and get a job, and you damn well pay your own way!
I think I'm going crazy.
No, you're not, Gina.
It's everyone else who's bonkers.
Let's go overseas.
You mean travel
by ourselves?
Where shall we go?
Not the Bahamas.
It's bloody awful.
Of course!
It's so obvious!
I know...
I'll lean back and put
my hair on my shoulder.
Then I'll look just like
Veronica Lake.
Oh, great!
Stay still,
or else they'll be blurry.
Oh, well, hurry up!
It's freezing!
Oh, just a couple more.
I know...
I'll lean forward now
and I'll show more cleavage.
Those girls are up to something in the bathroom.
I think they're taking photographs of each other.
Just leave them alone,
Henry.
I'm prepared to tolerate that Rieper girl's presence, but I will not stand for any... you know... hanky-panky.
I'm sure it's all perfectly innocent.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper.
She nicks stuff all the time.
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid.
I can try my father's safe.
I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
That's great!
We'll have the fare in no time.
As soon as those bods in Hollywood cop a look at us, they'll be falling over themselves.
Oh, it'll be amazing to meet James in person.
I just know we'll hit it off brilliantly.
And Guy Rolfe and Mel Ferrer.
And Mario!
Oh, I can't wait to do the love scenes!
But what if they're married?
Oh, don't worry about that.
We'll simply murder any odd wives that get in our way.
I rose at 5:30 this morning
and did all the housework
before 8:00,
including taking Wendy
her breakfast in bed.
I feel very pleased with myself
on the whole,
and also the future.
We are so brilliantly clever.
A good shot, Hilda.
Ah... excellent.
Boys and girls,
what have you been doing?
Direct hit!
Gave his trousers a jolly good soaking.
Everyone will think he's peed himself.
Ha!
Damn it!
Net fault.
Bloody Bill is sniffing around
Mummy something chronic.
Hmm.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
That's what we were led to believe.
Henry... I'm terribly worried about Bill Perry.
He's just had this spell
in hospital.
He's got nowhere
to convalesce.
No?
I- I've offered him the flat.
He really shouldn't be left alone... not in his condition.
Yeah.
I was so looking forward
to the ambulance arriving.
There's something
desperately exciting
about bodies on stretchers.
Oh, God! Bill!
But it wasn't like that
at all.
Bill!
I hope the trip didn't tire you.
Hello.
Not in the least.
What a splendid place.
Hello.
Hello.
It used to be the servants' quarters, but it's... it's very comfortable.
Oh. Corker.
Mother was completely taken in.
Do you think bloody Bill's trying to get into her drawers?
Too right.
But he doesn't have a show.
Nobody gets into
Mummy's drawers except Daddy.
Poor Father.
Don't worry, Gina.
Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Thanks, Prof.
You have alienated
the professorial board and completely compromised the good will of the council.
You could've at least been a bit more reasonable about the forestry school.
I stand by the report I made last year.
Canterbury College should not be diversifying...
Henry,
it's just not working.
Surely a man of your caliber is needed back in England.
I have my daughter's health to consider.
She requires a warm climate.
Dr. Hulme, let's make an effort to avoid a public embarrassment.
You have until the end of the year to find a new position.
Bill, it's not right.
It's not right.
- When?
- Not now!
You're a dreadful flirt.
Just washing my hair now,
Laurie.
Won't be a moment.
Is she still in there?
Come on, Yvonne.
You've had enough time.
Yvonne!
Yes, yes, yes.
You open up this door right now.
I'm bloody dressing
as fast as I can,
for God's sake.
Open this door!
Mother gave me
a fearful lecture
along the usual strain.
I rang Deborah immediately,
as I had to tell
someone sympathetic...
how I loathed Mother.
Mother told me
I could not go to Ilam again
until I was 8 stone
and more cheerful.
All week I have looked forward
to going to Ilam,
and now this.
She is most unreasonable.
I also overheard her making
insulting remarks
about Mrs. Hulme.
I was livid.
I am very glad, because
the Hulmes sympathize with me,
and it is nice to feel that
adults realize what Mother is.
Dr. Hulme is going to do
something about it, I think.
Why could not Mother die?
Dozens of people are dying
all the time... thousands.
So why not Mother?
And Father, too.
Yvonne...
Come on, dear.
Now shut your eyes and make a wish.
The balloon has gone up!
- What on Earth are you talking about?
Mr. Perry's ill.
I've brought him a cup of tea.
Would you care for one,
Juliet?
Don't try and fob me off.
It's going to cost you Â£ 100, or else I'm blabbing to Daddy.
Mister... Perry and I are... in love, Juliet.
Hilda...
Your father knows
about us.
Until other arrangements can be made, we've decided to live together as a threesome.
I don't care what you do.
Paul and I are going to Hollywood.
They're desperately keen to sign us up.
We're going to be film stars.
What are you talking about?
It's all arranged.
We don't need your bloody Â£ 100 anyway, so stick it up your bottom!
Deborah told me
the stupendous news.
I'm going out to Ilam,
as we have much to talk over.
Hello!
Deborah was still in bed
when I arrived.
Dr. Hulme asked us
to come into the lounge
to have a talk with him.
Your mother and I... are getting divorced.
The shock was too great
to have penetrated my mind.
It is so incredible.
Poor Father.
Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind
and understanding.
He said we must tell him
everything
about our going to America.
He was both hope-giving
and depressing.
We talked for a long time,
and Deborah and I were near
tears by the time it was over.
What is to be the future now?
We may all be going to Italy
and dozens of other places,
or not at all.
None of us know where we are,
and a good deal depends on
chance.
Dr. Hulme is the noblest
and most wonderful person
I have ever known of.
One thing Deborah
and I are sticking to...
through everything,
we sink or swim together.
Your mother and I
have talked things over,
and we've made some decisions.
I'm resigning from the university, and I'll be taking up a position back in England.
But, Daddy, you can't just leave me here with Mother.
I thought it best if you accompany your father.
Is Gina coming, too?
Of course not.
I'm not going to England without Gina!
You're not going to England, darling.
I'm leaving you in South Africa with Auntie Ena.
That chest of yours isn't
getting any better.
A warmer climate is
just what you need.
For the good of your health.
The Hulmes will look after me.
They want me to live with them.
Don't be so ridiculous.
You're our daughter.
You belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah.
We're going to South Africa.
You're not going
anywhere.
You're 15 years old,
Yvonne.
You have to let me go!
We'll talk about this when you've calmed down.
I felt thoroughly depressed
and even quite seriously
considered committing suicide.
Life seemed so much
not worth the living
and death such an easy way out.
Love, you can still write to each other.
Anger against Mother boiled up
inside me,
as it is she who is one of
the main obstacles in my path.
Suddenly a means of
ridding myself of this obstacle
occurred to me.
If she were to die...
I cannot begin
to attempt to measure
the inestimable value
of Dr. Hulme's contributions to Canterbury College, both social and official.
We wish both him and Mrs. Hulme all the best for the future.
Everything's
going to be okay, Gina.
Mr. Perry promised to give me
Â£50 for my horse.
That's 120!
Just another Â£30, and we've got the fare!
It's no bloody good.
I went to the passport office today.
They won't give me one till I'm 20!
But that's not true!
I've got one!
No...
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Oh, don't cry, Gina.
Gina, please don't cry.
We're not going to be separated. We're not.
They can't make us!
They can't!
They can't!
They can not.
Off me!
I hate you!
Yvonne...
Don't be like this, love.
I did not tell Deborah
of my plans
for removing Mother.
I have made no decision yet,
as the last fate I wish to meet
is one in a borstal.
I am trying to think of
some way.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the telephone.
What now?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state.
She's uncontrollable.
I've told her Pauline isn't going to South Africa.
She refuses to accept it.
Well, I expect you've heard the same from your own daughter.
Um...
Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for... um, nearly two weeks.
Yes.
Well... it hasn't been an easy time for any of us, Mrs. Rieper.
She's cut us out of her life, Mrs. Hulme.
It's been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.
What I'm suggesting is that we let the girls spend these last three weeks together.
We would like Pauline to come and stay with Juliet until she leaves.
Is that a good idea?
Perhaps I could telephone you tonight, Mrs. Hulme.
Yes, yes.
Of... of course.
# When you are in love #
# It's the loveliest night
of the year #
# Stars twinkle above #
# And you almost can touch them
from here #
# Words fall into rhyme #
# Anytime you are
holding me near #
# When you are in love #
# It's the loveliest night
of the year #
Charles!
Charles! Charles!
# Waltzing along in the blue #
# Like a breeze
drifting over the sand #
# Thrilled by the wonder
of you... #
We've realized
why Deborah and I have such
extraordinary telepathy
and why people treat us
and look at us the way they do.
It is because we are mad!
We are both stark raving mad!
#... when a birthday
is near... #
All the cast of the saints
are mad, too.
Dr. Hulme is mad,
as mad as a March hare.
#... the loveliest night
of the ye-e-e-e-e-ar #
Halt!
It was the first time
I had ever seen "It."
Deborah had always told me
how hideous he was.
Is that you?
You're through, Harry.
Come out.
You haven't got a chance
this way.
What do you want?
You might as well give up.
"It" is appalling.
He is dreadful.
Come back!
I have never in my life
seen anything
in the same category
of hideousness,
but I adore him!
Bah!
Ah.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Gina!
We talked
for some time about "It,"
getting ourselves
more and more excited.
We enacted how each saint
would make love in bed.
We spent a hectic
night going through the saints.
It was wonderful...
heavenly... beautiful...
and ours.
We felt satisfied, indeed.
We have now learned the peace
of the thing called "bliss"...
the joy of the thing
called "sin."
I'm coming with you.
Yes.
I know what to do about Mother.
We don't want to go to too much trouble.
Some sort of... accident.
People die every day.
Our main idea for
the day was to murder Mother.
This notion is not a new one,
but this time
it is a definite plan
which we intend to carry out.
We have worked it out carefully
and are both thrilled
by the idea.
Naturally,
we feel a trifle nervous,
but the pleasure
of anticipation is great.
Only the best people fight against all obstacles... in pursuit of happiness.
We both spent last night having
a simply wonderful time
in every possible way.
I was picked up at 2:00 p.m.
I have been very sweet
and good.
I have worked out
a little more of our plan.
Peculiarly enough,
I have no qualms of conscience.
I arose late and helped Mother
vigorously this morning.
Deborah rang,
and we decided to use
a rock and a stocking
rather than a sandbag.
We discussed the murder fully.
I feel very keyed up,
as though I were
planning a surprise party.
Mother has fallen in
with everything beautifully,
and the happy event is to
take place tomorrow afternoon.
Next time I write
in this diary,
Mother will be dead.
How odd...
yet how pleasing.
# Have they gone? #
# I pretended to be asleep #
# Because I wanted to be alone
with you #
# I have so many things
to tell you #
# Or one thing
as huge as the sea... #
Mummy!
Mummy!
# Deep and infinite
as the sea #
# You are my love
and all my life #
I am writing
a little of this up
on the morning
before the death.
I felt very excited and...
The-Night-Before-Christmas-ish
last night.
I am about to rise.
Juliet?
Hurry up.
Ah, thought I'd lost you.
Mummy...
You've got roses in your cheeks.
Oh, I haven't seen that in such a long time.
Oh, bye.
Have a lovely time, darling.
I will.
I'm so looking forward to it.
Bye, Daddy!
See you tonight!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's enough bread to feed an army.
Hello.
Hello, Juliet.
Oh, what a nice outfit.
Thank you. I, um, bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Fruit.
Oh, pop them in a bowl.
Let's go upstairs,
Deborah.
I wrote the first 10 pages of my opera last night.
All right, then.
Do you feel all sweaty?
Oh, I feel sweaty.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Your mother is rather a miserable woman... isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept
Bernard's marriage proposal...
I think she knows what's going to happen.
She doesn't appear to bear us any grudge.
...but in the end
I decided against it.
I thought it would spoil all their fun.
Affairs are much more exciting than marriages, as Mummy can testify.
It's true.
He was spotted in the lingerie department, eh, Wendy?
There's nothing wrong with
Sir Edmund Hillary buying underwear for his wife.
He was a very nice man.
I- I bet it was thermal underwear.
I bet...
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on a mountain.
That's enough, Yvonne.
That man's a credit to the nation.
Right, who's going
to help me clear away?
I will, Mum.
Anything to get away from Laurel and Hardy.
I'd better be getting back.
- Bye, love.
- Bye.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Mr. Rieper.
Well, I'm going to make myself a bit more presentable.
Isn't it beautiful?
Let's go for a walk down here.
Come on, Mummy.
Oh, no.
I'd like a cup of tea first.
Come on.
You have it.
Oh... no.
I'm... I'm watching my figure.
But you're not fat,
Mrs. Rieper.
Oh, well,
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Go on, Mum.
Treat yourself.
All right.
Yvonne, love, w... we should be going back.
We don't want to miss the bus.
Juliet...
You button up your coat.
You'll get a chill.
Look... Mother.
Gina!
Hurry!
Don't!
No!
Don't! 
Gina.
Do not leave.
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Don't go!
You can't!
No!
I'm sorry.
No!

She's close!
Vitals are down to nothing.
Here you go. Come on.
Let me get in here. You got her?
- We're clear. We're clear.
- I got it.
- All right, lift her up on three.
One, two, three. Up.
- Who's hanging blood?
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
- Get in there.
Get her prepped. Let's move!
Let's go! Let's go!
We need some room!
Spread it out, spread it out!
Let's make a hole! Come on!

- We tried everything.
The trauma was just too much.
- [Sniffles, Sighs]
[Sighs] The baby?
The baby, I'm concerned, might have some abnormalities.
Outwardly, we can already tell that the child has no pigmentation.
It's called albinism.
It's strictly genetic.
That's, that's--
Well, that's pale skin, right?
And pale eyes that are usually more light sensitive.
- I want to see him.
- Greg, you have to remember that an unborn child... experiences everything that the mother experiences.
You take me to him.
You show me.

Thanks for making the drive.
- Are we still in Wheaton County?
- Barely.
- Did I ruin your Sunday?
- Well, I guess if somebody... was going to have to,
I'm glad it was you.
[Screen Door Squeaks Open]
Doug...
I can hear him again.
- He's movin' around down there.
- Tell me you didn't try to talk to him.
- You bet your ass I didn't.
- Good.
Miss Caldwell.
They said a boy, right?
I'm guessing that's what it is.
The old man here died last night.
The neighbors found him this morning.
- We figure the kid's his grandson.
- So where is he?
He won't come up from the cellar.
He didn't report his grandfather's death either.
We already know he died of natural causes.
Doug, what am I doing here?
The neighbors say he may be retarded.
One of them says deformed.
You know, physically handicapped.
I don't know.
I couldn't for the life of me think of who else to call.
He's scared enough, and I thought maybe you could... come down and talk him out of there without us having to go down and drag him out.
Jessie... the neighbors talk about him like he's some kind of a phantom.
I haven't met one yet that ever had a good look at him.
What are you telling me, Doug?
That the old folks may have kept him down there... like some kind of a family secret.
I don't know.
Boy?
I brought somebody to talk to you.
[Grunting]
Hello?
Hey, my name is Jessie.
Are you okay down here?
You think we could turn a light on?
Hey, if you're afraid, you don't need to be. Not with me.
[Boy, Softly]
I'm not afraid.
What's your name?
Powder.
- Is that a name or a nickname?
- He was getting coffee and he fell.
He jus--
He just fell over and died.
I tried to help him.
- I tried. He--
- [Doug] We know that.
Son, I told you, you're not in any trouble.
- I'm sorry. I just want to see you.
- Why?
Well, come on. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
It's all right.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
What's your real name, son?
Jeremy Reed.
You've been down here all night, Jeremy.
[Jessie] You must be starved.
Could you get us something to eat?
Anything. Sheriff?
We'll be all right.
Be right back.
[Footsteps Ascending Stairs]
Why didn't you tell anyone when you knew he was dead?
Why didn't you call the police?
Grandpa said there would be a day... when he would die... like Grandma died.
And that people would come... and see me... and try and take me away.
[Radio Transmission,
Onlookers Chattering]
- Get back there.
Keep an ear, but don't go down.
- Yes, sir.
Lucy, this is Barnum.
[Radio] Go ahead, Sheriff. I'm here.
We're still out at the Reeds'.
We got something out here nobody's gonna believe.
- You don't live down here?
- Mmm.
I do most of the work around the place... [Sniffs] at least until the sun gets too high.
Then the sunglasses don't even help.
Did you know they make contact lenses now... that can protect your eyes from the sun all the time?
I read about them, but Grandpa said they cost too much. [Sniffs]
When's the last time you were in school?
I've never been to school.
I read about it though.
But you said you read all these books?
And... have you read this book?
Well, I know college kids who couldn't wade through this one.
Pick a page.
Two hundred and sixteen.
"Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more.
"In what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will never weary?
"Where is the foundling's father hidden?
"Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them.
"And the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there learn it. "
You know the whole book?
I know 'em all.
- Go clear 'em back.
- All right, everybody, let's move back.
- And I mean back beyond the vehicles.
Let's go!
- [Onlooker] Okay.
[Hinges Squeak]
[Birds Chirping]

You don't have to be afraid.
You're afraid.

[Deputy] You ever see so many goddamn lightning rods on one house?
I just got off the horn with the coroner.
He said that old boy died of natural causes, but there was evidence of fibrillation.
His body was juiced with electricity.
That old man was laying dead there all night.
You think the paramedics showed up this morning and tried paddles on him?
Are you telling me the kid electrocuted the old man?
What do you think, he's Dr. Frankenstein?
I'm just sayin' that that's more than an albino, Doug.
That is spooky.
I never thought we'd find a man too white for you there, Harley.

What the hell is that?
You need to see him, Aaron, to know what I'm saying.
You need to see him sitting out in the hall right now...
'cause, I'm telling you,
I've never seen anything like him.
That's exactly what I mean.
Because of the way he's lived.
Uh, he doesn't seem to know what things are.
I think things you and I take for granted-- common, everyday objects, simple ideas--
I just don't think he's ever been exposed to them.
I mean, he's about the most well-read teenage kid you could ever meet.
But in other ways...
[Whispers] I think he's a lot like a little child.

You can either wear it on the end of your nose--

- I'm here, angel.
Something about a retarded boy they got up at the state home now.
How the hell did you hear about that?
I guess I don't have to tell you what I think about that.

I don't know what he is, but retarded he's not.
Well, aside from the absence of any and all body hair, which is a condition not too uniquely uncommon, bottom line, he's a very healthy young man.
In fact, with all that farm work,
I'd say you're in damn fine shape.
And the optometrist said his contact lenses'll be here...
- the end of the week?
- [Doctor] They'll be callin' him
"Ol' Blue Eyes"... in time for the county fair.
- You guys are comin', right?
- Uh, you'll see a few of us there.
Hey, Doc, thanks for comin' out.
It's my pleasure.
Good day, Mr. Jeremy Reed.
Jeremy, listen, uh,
I want you to think about something.
We attend school in town at Wheaton High.
You certainly wouldn't be at an intellectual disadvantage there, and I know most of the teachers so--
Anyway, um, all I'm saying is, if you'd like to attend school one day next week, I can arrange it.
Will my contacts be ready by Monday?
[Students Chattering]
[Continue Chattering]
[Brakes Squeaking]
[Chattering Continues]
[Chattering Continues]
- Come on, let's go. Okay?
- Hey, there.
- I left it in my locker.
- Hey, what is that?
- I'll go get it.
- Hey, check it out.
Hey, hey, guys.
Check that guy out.
- Look, look.
- [Girl Giggling]
[Chattering Stops]
[Chalk Squeaking]
[Softly] Molecules.
When we speed up the course of molecules, we get...
[Tapping Feet] energy.
And, um, since we are all basically... just a mass of molecules, what does our brain send out to all the other parts of the body?
Lindsey?
Um, impulses.
Yeah.
Electric impulses.
Jeremy, turn your head and look at Lindsey.
[Students Snickering]
Yes. That's lovely.
That's very good.
You've just relayed electricity.
Your brain sent out an electric impulse... down to your neck muscles... and, uh, what, what turned your head, besides the obvious?
What your, what your muscles used to turn your head?
[Snapping Fingers]
It's energy. Energy.
Always relaying, always transforming.
And never ending.
Now looky here.
This is a, uh, a Jacob's ladder.
It's a science fair toy, and it's, uh, built to show us how electricity travels.
Okay?
Can we get the, uh, shutters?
Watch this.
[Teacher Sighs, Students Gasping]
Hey, cut it out.
Cut it out.
[Clicks Switch,
Electricity Buzzing]
[Continues Buzzing]
- [Students Chuckling]
- [Teacher] Ooh, look at this.
Blinding, isn't it? Now, who can tell me why electricity travels?
Uh, boredom?
- [Students Laughing]
- Huh, he tickles me.
No. No, potential.
Potential.
One side of this thing is positive, while the other side... has a strong negative pull.
And, uh, that's all the potential that electricity needs to travel.
- [Buzzing]
- That's right.
That's pretty good. Don't I bring you good, entertaining things?
But you get the idea that it does-- You know, it-it travels and just keeps going.
Did you ever--
What's your experience with electricity?
Did you ever, you know, run your feet over a carpet like that and touch somebody?
- What happens?
- Static electricity?
That's right, that's right. Now, where does it go when y-you touch somebody?
- [Pen Spinning]
- [Teacher] It just goes out.
So ener-- So, so electricity, like energy, uh, just-just, um, uh, recycles.
- [Buzzing Louder]
- It flows in a cycle that d-doesn't end.
- It-It, uh--
- [Buzzing Louder]
[Buzzing Louder]
Are you all right?
Mr. Ripley?
[Arcing Faster, Buzzing Louder]
Are you okay?
[Students Shouting]
[Students Gasping]
[Gasps]
The local news and those Channel 5 people are outside.
So is Jimmy Hobbs from the newspaper.
- Tell them to go home.
- Oh, come on, Doug.
They ain't goin' anywhere 'til somebody goes out there and talks to 'em.
Tell them there's no fatalities, no sex scandal. That will get rid of them fast.
Goddamn it, Doug,
I sound like a moron...
- if I say more than five words to those people, and you know it.
- Well, if the shoe fits--
[P. A. System] Dr. Tarentino, you're wanted in Pediatrics.
[Doctor] But I can't do it. I've got no authorization to do anything.
- I can't let you go anywhere--
- [Doug] Hi, Doc.
Here we go, here we go.
Doug, Doug, tell Duane that it's okay for me to see that kid.
- Thank you.
- Donald, you're just the man
I wanted to see.
I got 20 different kids telling me 20 different stories.
Right. Uh, if I hadn't seen it myself,
I'd say it was impossible.
It was a model. For God sakes, it picked him right out of his seat.
- What did?
- Hold it! Ho-Hold it, Doug.
The kid doesn't have a scratch on him.
Heart rate's a little irregular, but nothing to indicate the kind of electrical shock you're talking about.
Right, right! And he's got a hole, uh, burned in his shirt... the size of a bowling ball.
[Ripley Sighs]
Something's happened here.
Something's happened here.
I'm telling you, with everything we know about science, about the makeup of the human body, what happened in that classroom is impossible!
That kid attracted an arc of electricity from 30 feet away!
And not just from the Jacob's ladder.
I mean, after a second, it was like it was... comin' at him out of the whole... building.
- You want to know why there isn't a hair on him?
- [Doug] Why?
Because he is electrolysis.
It can't grow on him.
- [Nurse] Doc Roth?
- Yes?
- Can I see you for a minute?
- Excuse me.
- [Nurse] Excuse me.
- [P. A. System] Dr. McGrail and Dr. Cain to C. C. U.
- Drink that in.
- Dr. McGrail and Dr. Cain to C. C. U.
[Doug] I will.
Nobody saw him leave his room,
- but his clothes are gone too.
- Find him.
He can't have gotten far.
[P. A. System]
Dr. Brodnick, call 2-9-2.
- Dr. Brodnick, 2-9-2, please.
- Lucy, come in.
[Birds Chirping]
[Dog Barking]
[Barking Continues]
- [Softly] Hey.
- [Growling, Barking]
- [Barking, Growling Continue]
- Zack! Zachary!
Zack, come here.
Come here, boy.
[Barking]
- [Growling]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch out. He bites.
[Whimpering]
The family before us made him pretty mean, so--
Wow, I can't believe I'm looking at you.
Are you okay?
- [Zack Whimpering]
- I didn't mean to scare anybody.
- The whole thing was pretty embarrassing really.
- Embarrassing?
You're kidding, right?
[Giggles]
My grandma used to say
I have an electric personality.
[Laughs]
Well, that was some light show.
I mean, people will be talking about that... to their grandkids' grandkids around here.
I don't mean to stare, but I had a bet with a friend... that you have blue-grey eyes.
She says they're blue-green.
Looks like she's right.
Well, actually, you're... you're both wrong.
Oh.
Sorry.
No, no, that's okay. Just kind of took me by surprise, that's all.
- [Zack Panting]
- [Sighs] Oh, well.
- [Raking]
- [Zack Barks]
- [Continues Raking]
- [Lindsey] You must feel like you've got two heads...
- the way everybody looks at you around here, huh?
- [Raking Continues]
Have you ever listened to people from the inside?
Listened so close, you can hear their thoughts... and all their memories?
Hear 'em think from places that they don't even know they think from?
What are you saying?
You can do that?
Are you sure you're okay?
[Nervous Laugh]
Do you know how to get to the interstate?
Yeah, it's um--
If you follow the train tracks, you'll see the Redmond water tower.
Then, if you go across the trestle, you'll see it.
- But you're really okay?
- [Softly] I'm okay.
You better hurry.
They catch boys running away from Central, I hear they get solitary.
Hey!
Stay away from those electrical outlets, okay?
[Softly] Bye.
[Birds Chirping]
[Chirping Continues]
[Engines Stop]
I didn't know better,
I'd say you were headed for the highway.
Don't make me come out there, boy.
Now, you're about to make me a whole lot meaner. Trust me, son,
- you don't want to make me mad.
- Afraid.
I don't make you mad,
I make you afraid.
What was that?
I said that you're afraid of me.
Duncan, get on back.
I can handle this.
I'm all right.
- I can see that.
- [Jeremy] Then let me go home.
I don't want to go back to that hospital.
We'll call the doc. If he says okay,
I'll take you back to Central.
Central's not my home.
[Doug] I'm trying to tell you as nice as I know how.
Now either you come with me without a fuss or we're gonna have ourselves a problem.
You want me to cuff him?
[Engine Starts]
Lucy, this is One.
We got him.
I'm coming back to the office.
[Transmission Distorts]
... Doug.
You got a problem with hospitals in general?
I don't like 'em.
Well, you can put me on that list.
Worst day I can remember was in a hospital.
[Door Opens, Closes]
What day was that?
The day I was born.
Let me get this straight, Jeremy.
You said that you've never been tested for I. Q. before. Is that right?
And your grandmother tutored you.
Did she ever say anything about it?
She said I was a fast learner.
[Laughs] Yeah.
Well, I think that's about to fall into the "no shit" category.
[Sighs]
Jeremy Reed, this is Dr. Aaron Stipler with the State Board of Education.
- Jeremy.
- [Jessie]
These men and women are here... because the results of your diagnostics came back with a few surprises.
Please, sit down.
[Sighs]
Miss Caldwell says you're a very unique young man, Jeremy.
Hmm.
She also tells me that, um, reading and your grandparents are the only ways you've experienced the world.
Is that true?
What about a radio or, um, a TV set?
- Surely you've watched some television at some point.
- He probably couldn't.
Didn't your grandparents have a TV set, Jeremy?
I could never watch television.
- Are you saying you weren't allowed?
- Here, it probably just makes--
- [Signal Distorting]
- No.
- [Distorted Signal Continues]
- Oh.
I'm saying I could never watch television.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That was-- That was my fault. l, uh-- I was-- I was just trying to make them understand.
What the good doctor hasn't, uh, let you in on yet is that...
- your test shows that you're a genius.
- [Stipler] Please!
Your I. Q. scored right off the charts, Jeremy.
There isn't even a classification for you, it was so high.
All of your tests indicate that you have the most advanced intellect... in the history of humankind.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
If you thought I was that advanced, would you ask me if I understood?
- [Chuckles]
- [Jessie] Jeremy, these people are in a position to help you.
Can they send me home?
- Can they send me back?
- No.
I'm sorry. They can't.
The fact is, the... the farm's in probate.
Do you know what that means?
Of or pertaining to probate or a court of probate, exempli gratia... the official proving of a will as authentic or genuine.
Or it can also mean the official, certified copy of a will so proved.
Right.
Well, it-it seems that the bank owns most of it.
I'm sorry.
[Clearing Throat]
Well, back to the matter at hand.
I have a few more questions
I have to ask you,
- Jeremy.
- You're not here to ask me questions.
You're here to find out how I cheated.
That's the only way you can make sense of it.
- [Lights Flickering]
- That's what you need to believe.
But I don't need you to believe in me, Dr. Stipler.
- [Lights Flickering]
- And I'm not interested in any of your tests.
I'm not interested in you, or anything else here.
I'm interested in going home!
[Lights Go Out]
- What the hell is going on here?
- What you already know.
I'm not like other people.
[Door Closes]
[Sighs]
[Boys Chattering, Laughing]
[Boys Chattering]
[Continue Chattering]
- Over there.
- Okay, do I got to hang it up too?
- No, no, no.
- [Guitar, Chattering Continue]
Did you see that guy playing in the football game?
- Yeah.
- God!
[Chattering, Laughing Continue]
What the hell is that thing doing up here anyway?
Jessie told me you didn't want to come up here.
I don't want to be anywhere that's not home.
Jessie's trying so hard to help you, kiddo.
If you're as smart as they say you are, you know she's about the best friend you got.
[Thunder Rumbling]
The storm's over Poho County.
We'll be lucky to get a drop.
When a thunderstorm comes up,
I can feel it inside.
And when lightning comes down,
I can feel it wanting to come to me.
Grandma said it was God.
She said the white fire was God.
Do you believe in God, Sheriff?
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- That it was God who took my mother?
[Thunder Claps]
Anna!
[Greg Screaming]
Hey.
Took your mother?
Your grandfolks told you that?
I remember it.
[Footsteps]
[Leaves Rustling]
Hello, John, Mitch.
What the hell are you doing out this far?
What are you?
You're supposed to be at the lake, skinny-dipping with the rest of the faggots.
[Cocks Rifle]
You afraid you're gonna get a little color on that marshmallow ass of yours?
Look, man, you'd better get out of here.
- [Mitch] Oh, Johnny!
- How about it, huh?
What are you doin', man?
I could do you right now.
Right now, man.
One less freak in the freak show.
Come on, man!
It might go off!
Why don't you go suck your old man off some more?
How about it, huh? You gonna show us one of your little tricks?
Come on, John!
It's--
[Gunshot]
[Jubilant Hooting, Shouting]
[Hooting, Shouting Continue]
- Let's go!
- Yeah!
- All right!
- Look at it! Look at it! Look at it!
Oh, man!
[Panting]
A good hunter don't hunt for the kill.
A good hunter hunts for the hunt.
Now, that's a perfect hit right there.
That's a perfect shot. That's a clean kill right through the heart.
Y'all see that?
Now, what she's doing now--
It's just her nerves dyin'.
Suffering's minimal when you know what you're doin'.
What the hell are you doing out here?
Now listen to me.
You didn't see any of this, you hear?
Now you just back out of here, boy.
Now, now, stay away from it.
It ain't dead yet, stupid.
Well, what the hell's with you, man?
Oh, let's get this moron out of here before he gets himself kicked.
[Gasping]
- [Boys] What's he doin'?
- What's he doin'?
What do you think you're doin', man?
- [Gasping]
- Hey, come on!
- Harley?
- Let Harley go!
- [Gasping]
- Oh, my God!
- Cut it out, man!
- Stop, man!
- Somebody do something!
- Say something, man!
- Are you okay?
- Somebody make him stop.
[Mitch] It doesn't matter what you do, just make him stop!
- Somebody make him stop! Come on!
- Come on, man!
- [Gasping]
- Harley! He's giving him a heart attack or something!
- Let him go!
- [Harley Screaming]
- Harley! Harley!
- Do something, John!
- Let him go, you freak!
- Do something, John!
- He's gonna have a heart attack.
- Let him go. Now. Let him go.
- Do it!
- Put the goddamn gun down, John.
- Do it!
- [Harley Gasping]
- [Gun Fires]
- [Harley Screaming, Boys Shouting]
- Harley!
- Harley! Harley, calm down!
- Harley!
- Are you okay? Harley?
[Gasping, Whimpering]
[Crying]
[Whimpering, Sobbing]
[Continues Crying]
[Sobbing]
Break it up, guys.
Come on. Okay.
[Doug] I left camp for less than an hour.
When I get back, one of my deputies is being hauled down the mountain in an ambulance.
The boys tell me that you gave him some sort of an attack.
It was like a seizure.
- Is that right?
- No.
Then what did happen?
Why won't you tell anyone?
I let him see.
I opened him up, and I let him see.
He just couldn't see what he was doing, so I helped him.
[Radio Distorting, Static]
Sheriff--
[Turns Down Radio]
You better start leveling with me.
Go ahead.
[Radio Static Continues]
It's Maxine, Doug. She just called.
I'm on my way.
I gotta go.
I need you to think real hard about telling me what happened.
Thanks, Jess.
- [Door Closes]
- Jeremy, please.
I want to go home.
Do you understand that?
I want to go home.
Look, whatever happened up there, whatever you saw--
I saw that
I don't like what you do!
Any of you!
- Jeremy--
- No!
You pretend to be my friend, the way you pretend everything!
[Glass Cracks]
A friend doesn't lock you up!
- [Glass Shattering]
- [Gasps]
A friend doesn't take you away from your home,
- [Gasps]
- and say that it's for your own good!
[Electrical Buzzing]
How long do you really think
I'll let you keep me here?
[Panting]
[Door Closes]
She's all right.
I got nervous when I couldn't find you, so I called the doc.
[Sighs] Harley just got admitted over at County.
Give a call over there, will you,
Maxine? Find out how he's doing.
Listen, this is like having your heart torn out every day.
Doug, there's no explanation why your wife should still be alive right now.
[Doug] Give me the short one, will you, Doc?
She can't like seeing this strain on you, which may be why she's hanging on through the worst pain of her life.
[Sighs]
It's just gonna make it that much easier if we get her back to County.
This is where she wants to be, Duane.
She told me when she still could.
She keeps holding on.
I just don't know why.
And you won't.
Doug, she's past communicating.
- You can't get inside of her head.
- [Sighs]
And if you could, she'd probably tell you...
"Let me go. "
[Crickets Chirping]
[Ripley Knocking]
Knock, knock.
Mind if I come in?
[Sighs]
Hey, you-you did something to me.
Um... you know,
I-I didn't figure it out... until enough people looked at me like
I was crazy or told me to act my age, but you, uh, uh, zapped me or I, uh, zapped myself when I touched you.
But I've been-- I-I've been running around on this high like I was 18 again.
I've had more ideas and more, more focus... and... better sex than I've had in ten years.
Do you believe me?
Well... why shouldn't you?
You know if what I say is bullshit, don't you?
So you know when I say
I'm just here to talk... that, uh, that I mean it.
Uh, say, did you--
Did you read any, uh, Einstein?
No? Oh, well--
Oh, I think you'd like him.
Um, he said he believed in life after death.
Only because energy can never cease to exist.
That it relays, it transforms, but it doesn't stop ever.
Uh, and he said that if we ever got to the point... where we could use all our brain, uh, that we'd be pure energy... and that we wouldn't even need bodies.
Now, um, wh-what would you say to the possibility... that because something happened to you, uh, something that never does or isn't supposed to, that you are, are closer to that energy level... than any one body has ever been?
I'd say, "So what?"
So what?
Jeremy, y-you know, y-your life up 'til now has been... that farmhouse and, uh, and the 12 acres of earth.
You know, you've kind of lived in books.
But I think you're starting to find out now that the misery... that you read about is real.
The tragedy is, is real in all those stories, Jeremy.
Did you think that it wasn't?
I mean, my God, that deer hunt--
You think that's the dark side of man? Killing for pleasure?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but you haven't begun to see what we do.
We're-- Jesus, we're stumbling around in a very dark age... basically just trying not to kill each other.
So it hurts me when you say, "So what?" because you are not just different, Jeremy.
I think that you have a mind that, uh, that we won't evolve to for like, uh, thousands of years.
You're maybe the man of the future right here and now.
I don't know.
And I'm-I'm not here to hurt you.
Jeremy, I want to be a-a-a friend.
[Sighs]
I want to talk with you.
Well... I mean, did you ever have a friend?
I don't need a friend.
Really?
Gee, I thought you were a genius.
You know what I say is true.
Are you telling me you, like, never shook anybody's hand before?
Ah, how do you do?
Hmm? Now we've been properly introduced.
Want to see a trick?
[Chuckles]
[Laughs]
Hmm.
Wow.
They were afraid to touch me after a while.
My grandma and grandpa, they--
They got really scared.
What? To touch you?
Jeremy, that's not right.
No way.
That's not right.
[Shifts Into Park,
Stops Engine]
[Knocking]
Doug.
You've done a little spring cleaning?
What the hell are you doing here, Doug?
A couple of my deputies told me that Harley Duncan... got rid of every goddamn gun in his house.
Said he dropped out of the marksman tourney over in Butte too.
The one he wins every year.
I just ain't huntin' no more, Doug.
Is that some kind of crime?
I just got lots of other stuff to do.
You gonna stop carrying one on the job?
If you can't pick it up and use it, that's a liability.
I want you to level with me.
I already know you snuck off hunting with the boys, which is the last damn thing you should have done.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
[Sighs]
And I popped this pretty doe, just up at Little Lake.
Let me tell you something, Doug.
You ever tell anybody I said this,
I'm moving out of town.
That... kid?
He lays his hand on the deer while it's still shakin'... and then he touches me at the same time.
Now, I can't figure out why...
'til my heart starts poundin' and I'm shakin', and I'm feelin' myself hurt and scared shitless, slippin' away in the goddamn dark.
That's the worst thing I ever felt.
It's like I could feel that animal dyin'.
[Exhales] It's like I was the goddamn thing.
- Aw, come on, Harley.
- Doug, I swear.
Now... I--
I just can't do it anymore.
I can't look at something down the barrel of a gun without thinking about it.
I've tried it.
I'm telling you, that thing ain't normal.
I'm telling you, he took whatever was in that goddamn deer, and he put it right into me.
[Door Creaking Open]
[Doug] I'm sorry, son.
Uh... Jessie said... it may be okay for you to come with me.
[Crickets Chirping,
Car Approaching]
[Engine Idling]
[Turns Off Engine]
I don't know what it is you do.
I'm not even sure
I believe you can do it.
But if you can,
I need your help.
- [Owl Hooting]
- [Sighs]
[Maxine]
Doug Barnum, don't you do this.
- That boy should not be in this house!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Go to bed, Maxine.
- If you heard the stories I've heard,
- you wouldn't want him in this house!
- Go on, go on.
- Go back to bed.
- I'm telling you, that boy should not be here.
Go to bed, Maxine.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
She knows you're here.
[Doug]
Talk to me, woman.
Tell me what
I can do for you, Emma.
She can't go, not until she knows you're gonna get through this.
She says the both of you.
You and Steven.
Steven?
What the hell do you want me to do?
What should I do?
Throw my arms around him?
She wants you to remember the snow when Steven was younger.
And it was snowing.
You were all playing in it.
A snowball fight.
And she lost her--
Ring.
You lost your wedding ring.
You looked down at your hand, and it was gone.
We all looked.
Me and Steven, we dug through the snow all afternoon.
He came back from school every day, digging through the snowbanks, thinking he'd find it.
She cried that you both loved her so much.
The way each of you looked so hard for it.
[Sighs]
I remember that.
I do.
The silver box.
The silver box on the table.
Oh, no, Mama. No.
[Gasps, Sobs]
Oh, no.
[Sobs]
[Jeremy]
He found it at the old house... in a garden he was tilling.
He said he knew right away what it was...
- and that it was time to come home.
- [Inhales Deeply]
She says she believes in miracles now... and that you should too.
[Sighs]
She thinks I'm an angel... come to take her home.
And to bring you and Steven together again.
Remind you how much you're still in each other's hearts.
[Sighs]
Everything about each other we don't like.
You know that.
He loves you more than any man in the whole world.
And she won't go, she won't leave this place, this room or this world... until you know that you still have a son.
She'd like to feel the ring on her finger.
[Sighs]
[Doug Gasping]
[Sighing]
You can hear.
[Sniffling]
Oh, it's all right.
[Crying]
Angel, it's all right.
[Sighs]
Good-bye, Emma, sweetie.
[Car Approaching]
- Hurry!
- What?
- He's got him up there right now!
- What? What is--
He's got him up there with your mama!
[Panting]
Poppa.
[Crying]
[Continues Crying]
[Crowd Chattering]
[Chattering Continues]
[Chattering Continues]
Why don't we just tell them all to stop, and they can just take a picture or something.
Jeremy, are you okay?
They're wondering if I killed her.
Don't tell me you're seeing inside them again.
What are people like on the inside?
Inside most people there's a feeling of being separate.
Separated from everything.
And?
And they're not.
They're part of absolutely everyone and everything.
Everything?
I'm part of this tree?
Part of Zack barking over fences?
You're telling me that I'm part of some fisherman in Italy... on some ocean
I've never even heard of?
There's some guy sitting on death row.
- I'm part of him too?
- You don't believe me.
It's hard to believe that, all of that.
Well, that's because you have this spot that you can't see past.
My grams and gramps had it.
A spot where they were taught they were disconnected from everything.
So that's what they'd see if they could?
That they're connected?
And how beautiful they really are.
- [Inhales Deeply]
- And that there's no need to hide or lie.
And that it's possible... to talk to someone without any lies.
With no sarcasms, no deceptions, no exaggerations... or any of the things that people use to confuse the truth.
I don't know a single person who does that.
Hold out your hand.
Put your fingers up.
Wow.
Is that your heartbeat?
And yours.
Wow, this feels strange.
You're afraid someone will see us holding hands.
You're really nervous talking to me.
You don't think you're pretty enough.
You feel alone.
You feel so alone.
Sometimes you just want to break out of yourself.
Your father.
Your father hurt you a long time ago.
You're so sad.
He made you so sad.
He thought you were, you were ugly and... and he kept saying you, you weren't--
- [Sighs]
- I'm so sorry.
Do you?
- Do you?
- Do I what?
Do you think I'm ugly?
I don't know what I think when I look at you.
But sometimes I-I think...
I think you're the most beautiful face I've ever seen.
What?
What in the name of God do you think you're doing?
[Sighs]
You having a good time with my daughter?
Wonderful.
It's a good school, and I feel good--
You think this is funny?
- Funny man, huh?
- Dad!
- You think this is funny, huh, lover boy?
- Would you stop?
[Crowd Chattering]
- Now, I asked you a question, and I want an answer.
- Would you please let him--
[Children Screaming]
- You think it's funny?
- Dad, he wasn't doing anything!
- [Dad] Answer me!
- Mr. Kelloway!
[Jessie] Let him go.
I said, "Let him go. " Dick Kelloway, you take your hands off him now!
- I thought your boys had rules about fraternizing.
- I said now.
Keep your state trash away from my daughter.
Christ, you know nothing happened!
Is that your expert opinion?
You keep that thing on a leash or I'll slap a lawsuit... on that state zoo that will shut it down so fast it will make your head spin.
I am so sorry.
Powder.

Why don't you take a picture, man?
Hey, Skye!
[Panting]
Does this look like a genius to you?
Peeping Tom faggot, maybe.
You were gettin' an eyeful of him, weren't you, light bulb?
You want to see what a real man looks like?
Huh?
You think you can take me, freak show, go for it.
In the meantime...
I keep the hat.
When you think you're man enough to get it back, you take your best shot.
You think you're man enough to get it back?
You take your best shot, tough stuff.
What did you say?
I'd beat you to shit before you got this old hat back.
That's what he said to you when he was drunk.
You were 12 years old, and he took your father's hat.
It's the only thing your real father ever left behind.
Your stepdad, John.
That's what he said to you.
"You think you're man enough to get it back?
Then take your best shot, tough stuff. "
And then he beat you bloody that night when you tried.
Hey, fuck you!
You had marks so dark, you were embarrassed to suit up for gym.
I ought to kill you right now, man.
I ought to slit your throat and spit down it while I'm doing it.
[Thunder Rumbling]
Well, what do you know.
Boogeyman's afraid of lightning.
Come on!
- What's the matter, freak show?
- Leave him alone, Johnny! Jesus Christ!
- He's scared to death!
- Bullshit, Mitch!
He got a free show.
Now we get one.
[Laughing]
Now that is white!
Look at that.
You're as bald as a baby.
[John] He needs some color.
Doesn't he need some color?
You definitely need some color, buddy.
- [Gasping]
- [John] Go get him.
[Thunder Rumbling]
Do it!
- Now you got some color.
- That's enough, John.
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Sighs, Chuckles]
There's not much fight in you, is there, freak show?
[Thunder Clapping]
You really think you can be like us?
Is that what you think, freak show?
Hey.
Hey, what the hell--
[Laughing]
[Laughing]
Holy shit.
[Zane] Look at this.
Look. What's going on here?
[Boys Chuckling]

- What the--
[Screaming]

Jesus!
His heart stopped beating!
- You son of a bitch!
- Zane! No, no, no, no!
- Don't touch him, man!
- What the hell are you?
- Don't touch him!
- [Mitch] Come on, you assholes!
Go and get some help now!
Do it!
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?
- You got to be kidding me.
- Come on!
- Just get away from him, man!
- [Electricity Jolts]
Stop it, man!
Come on!
He's gone!
[Coughing]
Go get help, you idiots!
Do it!
- [Coughing Continues]
- Now!
[Gasping]
Come on, man!
You gotta get outta here!

We can track it all down.
We-We'll find every book.
Uh--
Why don't you look at me and say something?
[Sighs]
Jeremy, listen.
From the first moment
I saw you down here, scared in the dark,
I had this feeling that... that you would change everything I knew.
And maybe... this is not the right place for someone as beautiful as you.
But if you come with me...
I promise you we'll find a place that is.
[Sighs]
[Footsteps Approaching]
[Footsteps Continue]
Let's go.

Donald.
Just let him come on down,
Miss Caldwell.
We don't want no trouble from you.
What the hell you doin', Jess?
The right thing.
[Sighs]
And if you don't see that, then why don't you just turn your head and please, please... just look the other way.
- I don't know how to do that, Jess.
- Of course you do, Doug.
Christ's sake, just, uh, you know, turn your head.
Just like that.
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Rumbling Continues]
[Ripley]
Let's do it.
He can't be out in this weather.
Where the hell are you gonna take him?
[Thunder Rumbling]
Let's have a talk.
Come here. Come on.
Why don't you hit the road, Harley?
- Do what?
- I said get the hell out of here.
I'm not gonna let this happen, Doug.
You're breakin' the goddamn law.
- Lucy, this is Harley--
- I said go away.
- [Lucy] Go ahead, Harley.
- [Radio Shatters]
You're out of your goddamn, motherfrickin' minds, you know that?
- All of ya!
- [Thunder Rumbles]
[Rumbling Continues]
Lucy.
Lucy, this is Harley.
I need some help out here at the Reed place.
- A couple of units would be good.
- [Thunder Rumbling]
Jeremy? Powder? Hey!
[Doug] If you're gonna go, you better go now.
Jeremy?
She didn't go someplace.
- Your wife.
- What?
I felt her go.
Not away.
Just out.
Everywhere.

I believe there is a place where the restless souls wander.
Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they wait for a chance to set the wrong things right.
Only then can they be reunited with the ones they love.
Sometimes a crow shows them the way.
- Because sometimes...
- Iove is stronger than death.
- It's not your fault.
- No, no, no.
- We didn't see.
Let him go!
He's just a kid!
He can't hurt you!
I'm scared, Dad.
Please, Dad, I'm sorry.
- No!
Gabriel... it's been a long night.
Caressing the marble and stone
Caressing the marble and stone
Ah, love that was special for one
The waste in the fever I feel
How I wish you were here with me now
They call this
"The City of Angels," but all I see around me are victims.
It's the city of drugs... and of darkness.
The city ofJudah Earl.
Got a name?
Grace. So what?
My name is Sarah.
Listen, Grace, maybe you want to get some hot coffee... and a little bit of food.
What do you want?
Nothing.
Do you want to eat here?
We all have our pleasures.
For some, it's the flesh.
And we provide for them.
For others, it's the drugs.
- And we provide for them too.
Our products feed this entire city.
While other kingdoms fall around us, we've succeeded... by being of a single mind.
Succeeded with guidance from a darker world, Judah.
Do you love me, Sibyl?
All must love you.
Really?
Then why did this sad-eyed sack of shit betray me?
Hey, well, l...
Hey, l-l-l-I didn't betray you, Judah.
L-l-I did it for the business, you know?
I mean, this last...
Batch of yours, it was bad... it was a hot mix.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Judah, it was given 'em seizures... whoa, get away.
Hey, Judah, your... your brand...
It should inspire trust, right?
I mean, come on, we can't kill off all the motherfuckers, huh?
I mean, hey, whoa, there'd be no one left to buy the shit.
So you destroyed 80 keys of product without my consent.
Hey, hey, back off!
Get the fuck away from me!
Look at this, Judah. You're surrounded by these fuckin' freaks, man!
You don't even leave this fun house anymore, man!
I mean, you have no idea what the shit is doing to people... out on the streets, man.
It could ruin your fix with the cops.
I'm not bullshittin'.
I mean, it's bad for business, huh?
All right, then.
Let's see how bad this batch of ours really is.
Hey! Whoa! Hey!
What the fuck is goin' on?
We're volunteering you for a little quality control.
Oh, jeez, Judah.
I'll make it up to you, I swear!
But you are. Weren't you listening before, Bassett?
I said we all have our pleasures.
Mine is the pain of others.
Guess you were right, Bassett.
That was a bad batch.
- Whoo!
I'm almost done.
- Are you okay?
- It stings a little.
That's why they call me the mistress of pain.
I'll get the other book out for you.
Let's see this masterpiece.
Go ahead, turn around.
Whew. Spin 'round a little.
Ho, ho, ho. There's nothin'
I can do for you, luv.
Christ, what a downer!
Some kid asked me to tattoo,
"If you can read this, you're standin' too close."
Right on her bum.
I tell ya, I've had it.
Well, it's better than pushing ink in Detroit.
Well, you can say that again, darlin'.
You can say that again.
- I got a little present for you.
- You did?
They do them for the Day of the Dead.
Thank you.
"Necrophagia,"darlin'... eat the dead.
"Life is just a dream on the way to death."
I like that.
Do you want to come have a beer, girl?
Um, no, I can't.
I gotta go home. I haven't been getting that much sleep lately.
And what is the dirty dog's name?
No, I've just...
I've just been having these really, really strange dreams.
I know.
Sleep with angels.
Sleep with angels.
- Did l...
No!
Talk to me, Sibyl.
Tell me what you see.
I see death returning from the vale of tears.
Look at them down there, swarming through the streets like insects.
It's the same each year, isn't it?
Lighting their little candles.
Whispering their wasted prayers.
This time is different, Judah.
This time someone is coming for you.
He has your name on his tongue.
It's finally beginning, isn't it?
What mask will death wear?
Can you tell me that?
I see the face of one of your victims.
All my sins remembered.
Now we're gonna be face to face
And I lay right down in my favorite place
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Ah, come on
Spider Monkey!
- What's this tattoo look like to you?
- This is a test?
- Come on, man! Tell me what you see!
- Come on!
- A bird.
Think about this!
Think! Think!
- Don't you see two demons?
- No.
I see a bird.
- Fuck you, you fucking fool!
And what's this in your ear?
Toro, toro!
- Ole!
Look.
- Who are you?
- Sarah.
I had a dream about you.
I saw them shoot you and your son.
I saw you drowning.
How did I survive?
You didn't.
- You're dead.
- No!
No!
This isn't real.
None of this is real.
No!
Where will we go
Oh, where will we go
This ghost follows
Ah, yes
- Danny! What are you doing?
- Hmm?
- You think you're a man? Come on.
- Yes.
Defense, defense.
The face, the face.
- Yeah, yeah, good.
- Aah! Help!
Want to do bullfighting?
Huh? Do the bull.
- Come on.
- Okay. Uuh!
Danny.
Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?
- Look, I made this.
- Who are they?
- These people?
- Yeah.
- That's you and me.
That's me? And the thing on top over there?
That?
That's a blue sun.
- A blue sun?
- Yeah, a blue sun.
What was that?
Danny, stay here!
Danny!
Come here.
Come here.
Danny!
See no evil.
- No! No!
- You can run.
Run! Run! Uuh!
No! No!
No! No!
No! Danny!
No!
Leave him alone!
- Dad!
No-o-o! No!
I want to help you.
Danny.
He's not here anymore.
I know.
What's your name?
Ashe.
There's a reason why you've been brought back, Ashe.
To find the people who did this to us.
To make them pay.
These were Danny's paints, weren't they?
Hey, old man
Got something for you
- Change your mind
Gonna make you take it
- Your mistake is something you own
And I'm the one who's gonna take it
Hey, old man
Got something for you
Got something for you
Got something for you
Hey, old man
Got a real good tip
- Got a real good tip
- Something's wrong and you don't know it
You don't know it
You don't know it
When will you learn
I'm not your boy
You don't look back
Why do I pick up your slack, man
When will you learn
I'm not your boy
Hey, old man
Got something for you
Gonna...
- Ahh!
- Ooh!
- OlÃ©!
- Whoop!
- Toro!
- Ah-ha-ha-ha!
Who the fuck are you?
- Does the corpse have a familiar face?
- Flowers for the dead, seÃ±or?
We killed you, man.
You're dead!
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- Whoo-oo-oo!
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.
There's nobody out there listening.
- Yee-aagh!
- I'm all your nightmares... rolled into one!
- Wuh-aah!
Aa-aa-aah!
Oh, geez! No way, man!
- Fuck! Oh!
This shit's flammable, man.
- The others. Who are they?
- Huh?
- Nemo,
- Hmm.
- Kali, Curve and Judah.
- I'll start with Nemo...
And then work my way up the food chain.
- Where is he?
- Nemo?
- Mm-hmm.
- He's an old pervert.
He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama on Deacon Street.
Congratulations, Monkey!
You just bought yourself a fighting chance!
Pick a card, Monkey.
Come on.
Come on.
Lady Luck's... a bitch.
Oh...
Jesus, man. Come on, man.
Come on, come on, come on.
You're wasting your breath, angelito.
- Nobody's up there listening.
I want to be your
Be your rubber ball
- I want to be the one
You love the most of all
Oh, yeah
- I'm your boogie man, boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man, boogie man
I'll do what you want
I'm your boogie man
Boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man
Ohh...
I got bad news. Someone torched the lab on Manchester.
Spider Monkey's a fucking crispy critter.
Monkey I could care less about.
What about our merchandise?
- It's a total loss.
- He left a sign, didn't he?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Yes, you do.
You've seen it.
You've been marked.
Jesus Christ. Judah, why the fuck do you listen to her?
Because she speaks the truth.
What's this, Curve?
A beauty mark?
And all the world will be in love with night.
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
- Noah?
- Yeah.
Do you believe in fate?
Seems to me it's a question of... fate believin' in you.
- We're closed for the night!
- Open the fucking door!
I said, we're closed. Aah!
- Fucker!
- Think what you did to me was funny?
- God...
- Some kind of joke? Huh?
- Stop! It hurts me!
Huh? Huh?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talkin' about this fuckin' tattoo you gave me! Look at this shit!
- It's a crow.
- You're goddamn right it's a crow.
Did I ask you for a fuckin' bird on my chest? Did I?
I was going from the fucking design that you gave me!
Stop it! Stop it!
O-Oh!
Well, what's it gonna be, hero?
Ready to kiss your faggot ass good-bye?
I think you're shittin' yourself, you're so goddamn ready.
Fuck you!
Uuh!
- You fucking piece of shit!
- Aah!
- Get up.
- Girl to girl sincerity

Awkwardly unnamed
- You never kissed

Simple choice to fall away
Fall away
Away, away, away
Away
Why is the world
- Falling on me
- Are you okay?
Well, fuck me. What are they going to be snorting next?
- I can't take this anymore.
Don't worry, love.
Everything'll work itself out.
Did she make you cry, make you break down
- Aah!
- And shatter your illusions of love
- Fuckin' shit, motherfucker!
Smile, sister.
- Whoo! Hey!
This is a recording.
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Live girls.
- It's his wreck. It's all right.
What up, Zeke?
Right.
How ya doin', man?
This is for you.
For you.
You got a name?
- Holly Daze.
- Put your hands in the air
Tonight is a special night
- You want me, baby?
- Put your hands in the air
Tonight is a special night
Check this one
Oh...
Throw your hands in the air tonight
Uh... I wanna see some sugar.
Check me out, Pop
Throw your hands high in the air
Sugar?
- Right on, sister.
Mmm. Is that for me?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We're gonna celebrate Christmas a little early this year.
Mmm. Keep doin' that, baby, you're gonna go blind.
- Fuck! Fuck!
Oh, yes!
Time's almost up, lover.
Hurry with those tokens.
- Oh, shit, man!
Come on!
Bitch!
Come on, fucker!
Come on, fucker!
Do you want me... baby?
You...
Me.
- Hey! Fuckin'mime boy!
- Uuh!
One crow, sorrow.
Two crows... joy!
- Three crows...
- Oh, ah!
A letter!
- Four crows...
- Uuh!
- Uuh! Aah!
- A boy.
- Let him go! He's just a child.
Uuh! Uh! Aah!
- Five crows, silver!
- Aah!
- Six crows, gold!
Seven crows, a secret never to be told!
Aah! Stop the fuck...
Aah! Please!
No, please!
- Please, just stop! I can't...
- Look at me!
Lights! Camera! Action!
- Aah!
- You killed my son, Nemo.
You took away the only piece of light left in my soul.
We had to! We had to!
It wasn't our fault!
Was Judah's orders.
Never leave any witnesses.
We didn't have any choice.
We always have a choice!
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Go, let's go!
- Live girls.
- Ow! Yeah!
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Let's go!
- Live girls.
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
Live girls.
Tokens for the bunny booths.
Live girls.
Tokens for the bunny booths.
Live...
In my room I want you here
Now we're gonna be face to face
And I lay right down in my favorite place
Holy fuck.
Do you know what they call a gathering of crows... Curve?
- A murder.
A murder of crows.
Think about it.
Can I help you?
I'm sorry, Father.
I was just watching.
Our doors were open.
What's all this for?
Dia de los Muertos.
Day of the Dead.
We light candles for our loved ones... so they might find their way back to Earth.
Tomorrow night we will celebrate.
The people will dance and sing and some will wear masks.
Why?
Some spirits linger here too long.
They become confused, mistaking themselves for the living.
They must be frightened away.
Santa Muerte.
Santa Muerte.
No soporte.
No lo soporte.
Santa Muerte.
No soporte.
Maybe there is another way.
- How... How'd you do that?
- Magic.
Blow on it.
Go on.
Like birthday candles.
You have power just like I do.
You have power over this.
That's him!
That's the son of a bitch I dumped off the pier, I know it.
I saw you kill him.
Look, you wanna tell yourself some bullshit fairy tales, that's your business.
- I'm not gonna sit here with a fuckin'target on my chest.
I'm gonna take this motherfucker out.
You won't stop him with guns or knives.
He doesn't feel pain.
His soul has crossed over.
So how do you stop a man who's already dead?
Can you look Destiny in the eye... without flinching?
You tell me.
The crow is his source of power; his link between this world and the next.
Sever that link, and he's as vulnerable as the next man.
You came back.
Were you married?
My ring...
It belonged to some friends.
Where are they now?
A better place.
What about you?
Danny's mother left after he was born.
She was a drug addict.
You knocked me out
Bit my lip
- You held me down
- What happens to me...
- And kept me sober
- when I finish what
I'm supposed to do here?
Through all this time
- You go back.
With no regret
Guess that's just the way
I liked it
- Ooo
- And what if I don't want to go back?
- Oh whoa-oa
That tattoo on your chest...
Who gave it to you?
Some bitch down at the Gargoyle.
What's that got to do with anything?
Everything, you idiot!
Find her.
If she gave you his mark, she's connected to him in some way.
She can lead us to him.
Fool!
Mm-aah!
What do you people want?
A house in the country.
A little dog.
A wife.
Two kids...
- and your fucking head stapled to my pussy seat.
- Listen...
We're only looking for Sarah.
Where is she, Noah?
I ain't gonna tell you that.
- I wish I could lose control
- But I think you are.
- I wish I could let go
I'm cumming on you
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you
Last chance, love.
- Go fuck yourself, you dried-up bitch!
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you
I took Danny last summer.
We went up on the bike.
Rode all the way up the coast.
It was cold, I remember.
We could see our breath.
Look at me.
Ashe?
L-Look at me.
No. No.
We can't do this.
I have to find the others.
I have to finish what I started.
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?
- Look.
- Who are they?
- These people down here?
- Yeah.
That's you and me.
Sleep with angels.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to look.
- It's not your fault.
- Lights!
- Look at me! It's not your fault.
You understand?
Action! Action!
Flowers for the dead, seÃ±or?
- No!
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.
Let him get out! Let him alone!
He's just a kid!
- What about the kid?
Pain is my power.
Kill them both.
Let him alone!
Let him alone!
He's just a kid!
- He doesn't even know who you are.
- Don't, please, don't.

Please don't cry
I beg you!
I beg you, please!
- Kali's gonna give you eternal life
- Don't! No! Aah!
- No! Aah!
- Nothing personal, sport.
I guess you were just in the wrong place... at the wrong time. Heh!
Dump 'em!
Ah! Hah!
Sarah's gone.
Ghost man.
Where is she?
You took my son's life.
Some people are just born victims.
Hush, little baby
Please don't cry
Do you know how to fight?
Do you know how to die?
- Yah!
- Come on.
Hah!
- Hi! Hah!
- Do you want to dance?
- Kali's gonna give you eternal...
Hah! Ah!
- Ah!
Hush, little baby...
Shh.
Don't say a word.
N... No!
Daddy's gonna buy you a big, black bird!
When I first heard the sound
I couldn't put it down
It made my life complete
Ah, give it to me.
Yeah.
Ain't it neat
And you know
I like it when you
- Spit
Oh, I like it when you
Spit
- Naughty boy!
- And when you do that
You know I'm getting wet
- Wear me on your head
Yeah, that's what I said
I wanna be your rock and roll
I wanna be your rock and roll
You know I wanna be your push and pull and it's only 'cause
I like it, whoo
Girl, I like it
Whoo, girl I like it
- Oh, yeah
Waaahh!
Nothing personal, sport.
- Hey!
- Look out!
Ow!
Fuck you, bird dick!
Time's up, Curve!
My naked cousin
I see him running
All over his land
- Scared as a chick-a-chicken
His naked skin fries
Fries in the sun
But my, my naked cousin
Can cook 'til he's good, good and done
He's running
He's running
He's running
Baby, he's running
He's running
He's running
He's running
Yeah!
Wrong place.
Wrong time.
Eh, Curve?
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?
You fucking freak!
Do you think I'm afraid?
- You think I'm afraid!
Can you hear me, Curve?
You're going to die now.
People used to put coins in the mouths of the dead.
Do you know why?
So they could pay the ferryman to take them across the river Styx.
What's this?
Open your mouth, Curve.
I want to thank you for showing me my pain, Curve.
You made me what I am.

Flores para los muertos.

Where am I?
The tower.
Everyone finds their way here eventually.
What happened to you?
Fate happened to her.
Sibyl's been cursed with the gift of prophecy.
Judah Earl.
She sees things that are fated to happen.
She cut out her eyes with a carving knife... because she wanted to make the visions stop.
But that only made the visions stronger, didn't it, dear?
Why did you bring me here?
I'm glad you asked that, Sarah.
You've got a very important part to play in this little drama of ours.
I intend to capture the crow, and you, my dear, are the birdseed.
Sarah.
First you smiled at no one
I found you first
They've grown fine inside of you
But it hurts if I even see you
Make you smile
I look over and cry
But that's too bad
Get stuck for nothing at all
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius
You won't to find
You won't find me
Go!
Go!
Look who's come home to roost.
Aah!
But that's too bad
- You'll get what you pay for
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius
You want to find
You won't find me
I'm coming home when I go
Aah
Ashe is here.
First you fight me
I found you first
They've grown fine inside of you
- Do you know what these are called?
Misericords.
Wonderful name, isn't it?
In the Dark Ages, these were used to deliver the death stroke... to the mortally wounded.
They were considered tools of mercy.
Easy.
Easy.
- Ah!
- Oww!
- Aah!
Ashes, ashes,
- Oh!
- We all fall down.
No!
You have taken his power.
He is only a man now.
Ah.
Hey, Dad!
If you give up now, we won't be together.
Danny!
Judah!
What...
What are you?
I'm your shadow, Ashe.
Every angel's got a devil.
I've tasted the blood of the crow and taken your power!
The crows. They are the souls who have come before Ashe.
They are crying for the people they have lost.
Now they have come for him.
Looks like the dead have forsaken you, my friend.
- Look at you!
- Go to hell!
Already been there!
And I must confess,
I liked what I saw!
Where's your strength, huh?
Where's your power?
You're nothing now, Ashe.
Not even a ghost.
- You want death?
- Yeah!
There he is, people!
Take a good look!
Uh! If you whip him, does he not bleed?
- Ashe!
Aah!
Sarah.
Sarah! Sarah!
Judah!
Aah!
Oh!
You can't stop me anymore, Ashe.
You haven't got the power.
There's nothing but pain for you now.
Pain is my power.
Take him!
Aah!
You can't die.
Oh, God.
Wait!
I wanted to thank you.
Where are you going now?
A better place.
I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander... burdened by the weight of their own sadness.
They wait for a chance to set the wrong things right.
Only then can they be reunited with the ones they love.
Sometimes a crow shows them the way... because sometimes love is stronger than death.
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon
Dig your grave
One less challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunlight burning to go down
Lousy lovers pick their graves but they never cry out loud
Cry out
Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now
Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home
Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And did you know by now
Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home
To go home
Home, home, home

<font color="white">Tiere, die scheinbar keinen Zweck haben, erfÃ¼llen eben doch einen.</font>
<font color="white">Die Bosse mÃ¼ssen ja auch essen.</font>
<font color="white">Es ist wohl der edelste Zweck von allen, wenn du drÃ¼ber nachdenkst.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie essen Schweine?</font>
<font color="white">Sie nennen es Speck oder Schinken, und Schwein nur solange es lebt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber ich bin ein SchÃ¤ferschwein.</font>
<font color="white">Der Mann der Chefin spielt nur ein bisschen mit dir.</font>
<font color="white">Aber frÃ¼her oder spÃ¤ter wird jedes Schwein gegessen.</font>

Passt jetzt gefÃ¤lligst auf!</font>

<font color="white">(TV) Gewaltige Probleme.
Sehen Sie sich das an!</font>
<font color="white">Keine Sorge, Valda!
Das war bloÃ ein Ausrutscher.</font>
<font color="white">Es geht schon viel besser.</font>
<font color="white">(Rex) He, halt! Stopp!</font>
<font color="white">Wenn die Schafe nicht mit Babe reden,</font>
<font color="white">steht der Boss wie ein Idiot da.</font>

<font color="white">Die Schafe beim Wettbewerb reden nicht mit ihm und hÃ¶ren ihm nicht zu.</font>

- Wir helfen doch keinem Wolf!</font>
<font color="white">Warte hier, Wolf!</font>

"You want to build a rocket
"and send a man into outer space,
"don't come to me.
"If you're looking for someone
"to perform a delicate brain operation,
"I'm not your man.
"But if you have any questions
"regarding the quality of a fine pair of pants, that's what I know.
I know pants."
Ohh, I had a day.
Let me tell you.
Then he says,
"what about chinos?"
Talk about slaves in ancient Egypt.
Dad.
"I know chinos."
Mom?
Those slaves were in Disneyland.
Dad?
I grew up on jeans.
Being whipped while building a pyramid's no bargain.
Overalls... now he's insulting me.
Those slaves didn't have to book the himmelmans nonstop to Boca during easter.
"Einstein knew arithmetic, Pavarotti knows singing, and I know pants."
North was positive
he was having a coronary.
"Do you know who I am?
As a rule, 11-year-olds
don't experience
cardiac events.
"Let me remind you who I am.
But for north, this was
a very stressful time.
"I'm number 6!"
North was having a difficult time with his folks,
and it was putting a damper
on what was
in all other respects
a very successful life.
How successful?
Look at the year he'd had.
Photosynthesis... the process by which carbohydrates are formed in the chlorophyll containing tissues of plants exposed to sunlight.
Â¶ If I were a rich man Â¶
Â¶ diguh diguh diguh diguh Â¶
Â¶ diguh diguh diguh diguh dum Â¶
Â¶ all day long
I'd biddy biddy bum Â¶
Â¶ if I were a wealthy man Â¶Â¶ hey!
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
An outstanding year
by anyone's standards.
But did north's folks appreciate how special he was?
Hardly.
"I was inspecting pants before you even started wearing them,
Mr. Vice president-only because-your-father owns-the-company."
God forbid the himmelmans should stop over in Atlanta.
"I've forgotten more about belt loops than you'll know.
See this rash? Himmelman.
There's no ointment for this.
"Let me remind you who you're talking to...
"only this year's recipient of the coveted
Mr. Inseam award."
Well, that shut him up.
Dad... You know what that stupid Rachel did to me?
I saw blood in my stool this morning.
Aah!
Are you o.K.?
What's the matter, son?
Here, loosen his pants.
No, no, I'm o.K.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
I'm o.K.
But north wasn't o.K.
This parent thing
was starting to affect
every aspect of his life.
It's turning into the wind.
What sense does that make?
It's not... uh...
Maybe it's showing us where the wind was.
What are we supposed to do with that information?
To be...
Or not to... line?
Be.
Oh.
Be.
Ball 4.
That's six in a row.
Time out.
How ya doin'?
I don't get it.
A child is born, he's given a life, but then...
He's appreciated by everyone except the folks who gave him that life.
It's just not right.
Uh, let me rephrase the question.
How's the arm?
Mr. Blankman,
I've got some problems
I have to work out.
Problems? You?
North?
So while everyone speculated
as to what could
possibly be bothering
last season's
most valuable player,
north left the field
and headed straight
for his secret spot.
Yes, north had a secret spot.
You know the kind of spot
I'm talking about...
a place that's just
ordinary to everyone else
but for some reason
is special only to you.
No matter where it is,
it's the spot where you can go
and feel away from everyone
and everything,
the spot where you can go
and do your best thinking.
The one place where you can go
to reflect upon what was,
mull over what is,
or just sit back,
close your eyes,
and change the world
into whatever
you wish it could be.
It's my guess even north
couldn't remember
when his spot first revealed
its special powers to him,
nor did it matter
at this point.
What was important
was whenever he sat
in that huge armchair,
he looked like any other kid
waiting for his parents to finish their easter shopping.
He was sitting on that spot
the first time I saw him.
Why don't they like me?
What did I do wrong?
You o.K., kid?
Yeah.
Good, 'cause I only got a 10-minute break, and my back is killing me.
The last thing I need is to listen to somebody else's problems.
You hungry?
No, thanks.
Good,
'cause I'm starving, and this is my last carrot.
So, who are you?
I'm north.
Seen your name on maps.
Very impressive.
Who are you?
I'm the easter bunny... third floor, toys.
At least until Sunday.
Then what do you do?
Whatever I want.
Independently wealthy.
4th of July,
I might be Uncle Sam.
Christmas... maybe Santa claus.
My life's a holiday.
How about yours?
Not lately.
I had a bad game today.
How bad?
I walked nine panthers and hit my coach's wife with a wild pitch.
That's bad.
You got something on your mind?
Well?
What is it?
Thought you didn't want to hear anyone else's problems.
You always believe everything strangers tell you?
Come on, spill.
Aw, you wouldn't understand.
Try me.
It's my folks.
Yeah, what about 'em?
I don't know.
All they care about is themselves.
Selfish folks. That is rough.
They don't know what a good thing they got in you.
Exactly, and they're the only ones.
You should hear what the other parents say about me.
North's room is always clean.
North always looks both ways.
North never spoils his appetite.
North flosses.
Holy mackerel. Your folks are sitting on a gold mine.
Tell me about it.
You realize, of course, you're not alone.
What do you mean?
Look, kid, just because
I'm in a bunny suit doesn't mean I haven't stumbled across some basic truths.
The feeling of being insufficiently appreciated is a common childhood lament.
I'm not common.
Course not, but I'll bet you that even
Wolfgang amadeus Mozart... who wrote a symphony by the age of 3... had some evenings there with an angry parent yelling,
"stop banging on that damn piano."
But Mr. Mozart's dead and I'm alive, so I'll bet you that right now
I'm in more pain than he is.
Hard to argue with that one.
At this point,
I'd even settle for Mozart's parents.
Unfortunately, you don't get to make that choice.
The one thing we cannot control is who our parents are.
You're dealt a hand, you're stuck with it.
It's not like baseball, where you can become a free agent and try to get a better deal with another team.
Another team...
This is real life, kid.
The rules are different.
I got to get back upstairs.
You want my advice... and I know you didn't ask for it... go home, make up, and goodbye.
And that was it.
Nothing special.
I just left him there
in that secret spot of his,
just him and his thoughts.
Free agency.
What a scoop!
A kid becoming a free agent, then offering his services as a devoted son to the highest-bidding set of parents.
It's brilliant, north, simply brilliant!
This still isn't for sure yet.
This could be my Watergate.
Winchell, you put out a two-page leaflet with a circulation of 90.
Might land me a pulitzer.
I told you this as my friend, not as editor of the school newspaper.
I'm a journalist, north.
You never said this conversation was off the record.
I need time to think.
I'll hold the story, but a few more displays like that panther game, and some parents may start doing some thinking of their own.
That damn panther game.
And that geography test we took today?
What about it?
You got a 34.
Chicago's in Africa?
Mexico... an island off the coast of Montana?
Where'd you get this?
I'm a journalist, north.
I can't reveal my sources.
How I got this test isn't important.
Why you got this grade is.
Your instincts are correct.
You need new parents, and you need them now.
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless you haven't got the guts.
I've got more guts than anybody in this town.
Eh, talk is cheap.
I just feel I owe it to my parents to give them one last chance.
What can I say?
You came to me, sought my counsel.
The rest is up to you.
No, no, that's o.K.
Thanks, anyway.
North wanted to give his folks
every chance to keep
the family together.
He tried his mom,
but she was too busy
rerouting the himmelmans.
That left dad.
Pants. Can I help you?
My name is north.
Can I talk to my dad?
What number?
Number 6.
Looks like that 5-iron's a little short.
Number 6.
Number 6! Phone call.
Oh, uh, prom season.
Get a number, would you?
It's your son.
All right. Just a minute.
Is that piping holding up?
Very well, Mr. Vice president.
Now he's an expert on piping.
Hello.
Dad, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes, north.
We need these by 5:00.
I only got two legs!
North, I'm swamped.
Could we discuss this over dinner?
But, dad...
We'll discuss it over dinner.
Yeah, right.
Dinner.
Well, that's that.
O.K., guys, let's roll.
Zoe, you take the South side.
Winchell!
Winchell!
Here you go.
Here you go.
I've made my decision.
Let me guess.
How did you know?
News travels fast.
Apparently.
You got a lawyer?
Do I need one?
This is America.
Everyone needs a lawyer.
I happen to know the best.
Name's Arthur belt.
Let's move it.
Where will I find him?
Don't worry. He'll find you.
We got a paper to get out!
Hello, north.
Arthur belt at your service.
The lawyer?
Your lawyer.
We're a team.
You do what I tell you to do, you're going to have the best parents in the world.
You sure you can squeeze me in?
What?
Oh, the "ambulance chasing" thing.
Ha ha.
That's nothing.
I just use it to beat traffic.
Try it sometime on your bike.
Are we a team?
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, hey, hey. You know so.
Yes, north was actually
going to go through with it
and challenge the entire
concept of family.
The effect was immediate,
as kids now faced their parents
with confidence they once
only dreamed about.
What a great idea.
North's a genius.
Jeffrey, don't be ridiculous.
Now, where did I put that phone number for Arthur belt?
Did I say ridiculous?
What I meant was, you look very handsome today.
You realize north will never pull this off?
He's north. He can do anything.
His folks will fight it.
They won't take this lying down.
And then
the media circus began.
How do you feel?
Is winchell's story accurate?
Can we take that as a "yes"?
You think you can pull this off?
No comment.
North, if you're successful, how will your actions affect mother's day?
No comment!
In 1793, the cotton gin was invented.
North, could you please tell us the name of the inventor?
E-e... o.K.
Under strict advice from counsel,
I must respectfully say no comment.
Finally, north's day
in court arrived.
The world was watching.
All rise for the honorable judge buckle.
All sit for the honorable judge buckle.
Now, then, this is a trial, not a hearing.
Even though both sides will be saying things and I'll be hearing them, it is still not a hearing.
No doubt you'll be hearing the same things I'm hearing.
That's your privilege.
However, once both sides have been heard, it'll be my job to pass judgment.
Obviously, you can pass judgment, too, but it won't count.
That's because I'm the judge.
Have I made myself clear to the plaintiff?
Yes, your honor, it's quite clear to the plaintiff.
Have I made myself clear to the defense?
Your honor, the defense rests.
Then there's nothing left to do but make my judgment, and in my judgment, any folks who would sleep through this trial don't deserve a son like north!
I rule in favor of the plaintiff.
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
The system works.
North, you're a free man.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Â¶ Israel was in Egypt land Â¶
Â¶ let my people go Â¶ everybody!
Â¶ Go down, Moses Â¶
Hey! Hey! Pipe down!
Â¶ Go down, Moses... Â¶Â¶ this is a court of law.
Even though I have made a judgment, the trial isn't over.
I still have to make a ruling.
Now, then, today is...
July 1st.
Today is July 1st, and it's my ruling that north choose his new parents by labor day so he can begin school with his new family.
If he does not choose new parents, he may return to his original parents.
However, if he is not physically in the arms of either his new parents or his original parents by noon on labor day, he will be remanded to an orphanage.
And if any of you has ever seen the little rascals, you know that's no day at the beach.
Orphanage?
Not to worry.
From now own, the world is your oyster.
Even though north didn't
really care for oysters,
he couldn't help but take
Arthur belt's enthusiasm
as a positive sign.
North free agent draft.
Yes, his eyes are blue.
Soprano.
Super Mario III.
He believes in God and evolution.
Don't even get him started on the Warren commission.
Everyone wants you, kid.
Everyone.
Look at this.
You got a first class ticket to every city in the world.
My advice is, don't spread yourself thin.
Learn as much as you can about the parents you audition.
Once you sign with someone, that's it.
They're your new folks forever. Understand?
You bet.
That's the spirit.
Let's get cracking.
So north was on his way.
It was the 4th of July.
This year, independence day
had a special meaning
for north.
He was a free man
searching for the life
he felt he deserved.
There he is.
Look at that boy.
There he is, pa.
Well, hey, howdy, north.
I'm pa Texas. Here's ma Tex.
And welcome to the great state of Texas.
Uh, howdy.
I know what you're thinkin'.
Big car, right?
Well, it did cross my mind.
Everything I own's the biggest and the best.
That's why we'd like you to become our son.
'Cause you're the best.
To the best.
Home, sweet home.
This can all be yours, son... the main house, guest house, livestock, oil Wells.
Rumor has it you like baseball.
I used to own the Houston astros.
Really? What happened?
Just this morning, I signed them over to you.
Gee, don't get me wrong.
They're a fine organization, but aren't we rushing things?
Pretty fair shootin', Gabby.
Thanks, boss.
Hey...
What are you doing here?
Finished all my chores.
Figured I'd get some shootin' in.
No, I... I mean...
Have you ever been an easter bunny?
Easter bunny?
Careful, son.
Gabby's killed men for less than that.
Sorry.
No harm done.
So, what you two cowpokes got planned for tomorrow?
We'll wake up early and eat, then dig for oil and eat, then rope doggies and bust broncs, then maybe grab a bite to eat.
You like Tex-mex?
I'm a fan of any food that straddles two borders.
That's my boy.
But what's the deal with all this eating?
It's simple.
Remember I told you everything I own's the biggest and best?
You're already the best.
There's nothing left but to make you the biggest.
And don't fret about not being able to clean your plate.
Pretty soon that stomach of yours will stretch and stretch, and your capacity for food will grow and grow.
Excuse me. You say that like that's a good thing to have happen to your stomach.
It is.
Why?
Well, then you'll be like buck.
Who?
Our first son.
Biggest boy this big state's ever seen.
He could eat more in one day than anyone else eats in a month.
That's why buck hated February.
Where is buck?
He died in a stampede.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
It was a mighty big loss.
Now we'll show you how much we're lookin' forward to making you our new son.
Ready, pa?
Ready, ma.
Â¶ We had a son who was trampled Â¶
Â¶ by a ton of longhorns Â¶
Â¶ but you're here, cutes Â¶
Â¶ to fill his boots Â¶
Â¶ as flat as they may be Â¶
Â¶ you'll yell yippee-ai-o at the rodeo Â¶
Â¶ till the day's done Â¶
Â¶ then you'll make a lot of pals Â¶
Â¶ with buffalo gals Â¶
Â¶ just leave some for me Â¶
Â¶ we'll barbecue steaks and stew Â¶
Â¶ feed you pumpkin pie Â¶
Â¶ till your can's bigger than Â¶
Â¶ the big ol' Texas sky Â¶ yee-hah!
Yee-hah!
Yee-hah!
Yee-hah!
Whoo!
Â¶ You'll grow tall and play football Â¶
Â¶ be famous Â¶
Â¶ you'll grow more, own a chain of stores Â¶
Â¶ marry Betty Lou Â¶
Â¶ oh, north Â¶
Â¶ north Â¶
Â¶ grow, north Â¶Â¶
'nother rib, son?
You o.K., cowboy?
Yeah.
Just thinking.
Texas nights are sure good for thinking.
Yeah.
You doing any particular type of thinking or just wandering thinking?
I was thinking if I stay here,
I'll always be living in the shadow of someone else.
What kind of life would that be?
From what I hear about buck, what kind of shadow would that be?
Yeah, he was a big one.
Mighty hard being your own man when they're always comparing you to somebody else.
Yeah, right.
I mean, I left home because I had parents who didn't appreciate who I was.
Why would I want new parents who'd only appreciate me if I was someone else?
You might be onto something there, son.
You know, down here in these parts we got a saying... sometimes when you're panning for gold, you got to try more than one stream.
We really wish you'd reconsider.
I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be fair to any of us.
Thanks for the opportunity, north.
Oh, sir?
Yes, north?
I think it's only right
I give you back the astros.
Well, thanks, son.
That's a class gesture.
Well...
Goodbye.
So long, pard.
We'll miss you.
Hold on there, son.
Just a little something to remember your old buddy Gabby by.
Hope it brings you good luck.
Thanks.
So north resumed his search,
and though he got
to the airport by noon,
out of respect
for ma and pa Tex,
in true cowboy tradition,
he chose to wait eight hours
to fly off into the sunset,
with no knowledge at all
of what was going on back home.
How much longer do we have to put up with this indignity?
How much longer must we tolerate these injustices?
The subservience?
It's humiliating, my friends.
It's demeaning.
Right on!
Now is the time to say no!
Now is the time to say,
"just because you were born
25 or 30 years before me
"doesn't make you smart.
"It doesn't make you right.
It just makes you old!"
"It just makes you smell worse in the morning!"
Now is the time to band together and let our parents know we're at the dawn of a new era... the era of our liberation!
An era made possible by a kid who had the guts to fight for the power we now possess!
And now the man whose brilliant legal mind shone the light on the pathway to freedom...
Mr. Arthur ulysses belt, esquire!
Thank you!
I am but a humble servant, standing at your ready, to assist in this noble cause!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
But like I said,
north didn't know
about any of this.
He was on his way to Hawaii
to meet what he hoped
would be his new parents.
Governor and Mrs. ho?
Aloha, north.
Welcome to our island paradise, north.
Aloha.
We've got a big day planned for you.
Waki-waki will take you to the house to change.
Aloha.
Aloha?
I thought that meant hello.
In Hawaii, aloha means hello and goodbye.
Doesn't that get confusing?
Only when you're firing someone.
Oh, well, aloha.
Isn't he great?
You know, north, if you settle here, you'll be many years younger because of the difference in time zones.
You won't die as early as you would if you lived on the mainland.
That's a plus.
Another thing, north.
If you live in Hawaii, it's much easier to get into a good college.
How's that?
We have only 12 letters in our alphabet.
Really?
That's right. Five vowels...
A-e-I-o-u.
Seven consonants.
H-k-l-m-n-p-w.
I didn't know that.
Well, sure.
Just think about it.
Waikiki, Honolulu...
Kaanapali, mauna lani.
That's very interesting, but how does that help me get into college?
Since we don't use the letters b-c-d and "f", you're pretty much guaranteed to get straight as.
What do you think?
Well, I like what I see, but I do have one question, just for my own peace of mind.
What is it?
I hope I'm not being insensitive, but you wouldn't have a dead kid whose shoes you want me to fill?
Dead kid?
North, Hawaii is a lush and fertile land.
There's only one barren area on all of our islands.
Unfortunately, it's Mrs. ho.
But if all goes right, you will be our first child.
Wow!
What a great day.
You know, this might really work out.
As far I'm concerned, there's just a few minor details to discuss.
You know, bedtime, sleepovers, your views on snacks.
That sort of thing.
What are we standing here for?
Let's go inside and push a few numbers around, see what we come up with.
Ladies and gentlemen,
governor and Mrs. ho.
Heahea 'oe!
Komo mai e kai e ku aloha!
Ladies and gentlemen, fellow 50th staters,
I am thrilled to announce that we have reached an agreement in principle which allows me to introduce to you today a young man, who in coming years will be to Hawaii what the peach is to Georgia, the apple is to New York, the wind is to Chicago!
Now, without further ado, please give a big, warm
Hawaiian welcome to our new pride and joy... our son north!
What is that?
Son, that'll be in every airport, along every highway...
My crack?
My crack is going to be shown in every airport?
What gives you the right to show my crack on every highway?
The truth is, north,
I'm governor of a state running low on self-esteem.
After 35 years of statehood, people still don't treat Hawaii like we're part of the country.
Sure, there's a star for us on the flag, but why didn't anyone show up during "hands across America"?
Not even a phone call.
It's just plain inconsiderate.
He's right.
People from the mainland just don't care about Hawaii.
They come with their knobby knees and pale kids, eat our food, watch our whales, say "aloha," like they really mean it.
7 to 10 days later, they drop us like a sack of rancid poi.
We're supposed to feel good about ourselves?
Excuse me. What's this have to do with my crack?
Don't you see, north?
If you lived here in Hawaii, people would be more inclined to settle here.
So they can be close to my crack?
North, north...
You're very important to us.
I don't know.
I need some time to think, o.K.?
1, 2, 3, 4 Jacks!
Come on, guys!
Don't just stand there.
Get your butt in motion!
You might just like it!
And squat down, up and...
What is the point?
Gabby, what are you doing here?
They say for every hour you exercise, you add an hour to your life.
Who needs all that extra time if you're just going to spend it exercising?
See where I'm going?
Who's Gabby?
A ranch hand from Texas.
Not familiar with the gentlemen.
So, how's it feel to be Hawaii's new first son?
Well, I'm not so sure that's what I want to be.
Why not?
Beautiful climate.
Can't beat the fashion.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think I should settle for parents who have to show my most private crevice on a billboard to feel better about themselves.
It's refreshing to meet a kid who has such strong convictions about his crack.
Whoa! Whoa.
Ah!
Dig, man.
The way I always figured this deal is parents are supposed to make the kids feel better.
Not the other way around.
Yeah.
Hang in there, kid!
You'll find what you're looking for.
I hope so.
Although he came up short
in both Texas and Hawaii,
north felt no anxiety,
as he still had eight weeks
till his labor day deadline.
Welcome to Juneau, Alaska.
Remain seated until the plane comes to a complete stop
in Anchorage, Alaska.
To accompany our skid,
we'll be showing another
full-length feature film.
Our friend had a dream, and that dream is becoming a reality.
Meanwhile, as north
was skidding
his way to Anchorage,
things were heating up at home.
Winchell's
inspirational speeches
had created a groundswell,
and all across the land,
kids continued holding
their parents
at emotional gunpoint.
Anything else, son?
Yes. How's my room coming along?
I'll have it spotless by dinner.
Viva El norte.
And as of next Monday, no parent will be permitted to see an r-rated movie unless accompanied by a kid.
Yeah, right.
Arthur, do I detect a note of melancholy?
It's just that north still hasn't found new parents.
Maybe he never will.
Maybe this free agency thing will blow up in our face.
I'm surprised at you.
Do you think I'd embark on an endeavor of this magnitude without a contingency plan?
Contingency plan?
Oh, good. I love those.
One Coca-Cola.
Right here.
And one sex-on-the-beach.
Aren't I naughty?
To our future.
What a future it is.
According to the latest polls, parents are so nervous, that 78% of them say they'll vote however their kids tell them to.
And since those kids will do whatever you tell them to...
Well, I, uh...
What I mean is...
That's right.
I'm lying here with the next president of the United States.
I'm happy for you, Arthur.
I'm sure you'll make a fine commander-in-chief.
Hey, dollface, could you concentrate on my lower back?
That's where all my tension builds up.
Flight 24 from Hawaii
by way of Juneau
is now arriving at gate seven.
Approach 119-90.
Hey, great landing, guys.
You've really got that skid thing down to a science.
Thanks for the kind words, north.
We've dented a terminal now and then, but eventually you get the hang of it.
Thanks.
North's first impression
of Alaska
was a positive one.
The air was clean,
it was breathtakingly
beautiful,
and, best of all,
it was far away from
everyone and everything.
There was nothing
to distract these people
from concentrating on life's
most precious commodity...
the love of a good family.
Morning!
Whoa ho!
Here you go, north.
A nice cup of hot cocoa.
And to go with that, our state dish... eskimo pie.
Thank you.
Hey, what do you know?
The salmon are running.
I'm going to get poles and go fishing with my boy.
Great! I love fishing.
This is the life, right, son?
Sure is.
You like Christmas, north?
Who doesn't?
You've never had a Christmas till you've had an Alaskan Christmas.
Since our days last for months at a time, you can imagine the festivities.
Why, opening presents takes three weeks alone.
Right, ma?
This all sounds great, but what's the catch?
What do you mean?
I mean, what's in it for you?
Nothing.
Really?
No dead kids?
No low self-esteem?
No frozen skeletons in your closet?
We have pride, north, and we're proud of our pride.
We wouldn't ask anything of a child.
We want you to follow your dreams and be the best north you can be.
You'll be a source of pride to the entire eskimo community for many, many years to come.
Oh, jeepers creepers, that reminds me.
Oh, dad, let's go!
Time to flow!
Coming!
Time to what?
Bundle up. It's a long walk.
Who's that?
North, this is your new grandfather.
Hello, north.
Hello. What do you mean
"it's time to flow"?
When an eskimo gets too old or weak to contribute to society, the whole family gets together and walks to the ocean.
Then the revered old eskimo is proudly placed on an ice floe and set out to sea to die with dignity.
And pride.
All right, everybody, let's go.
But wait a minute.
Just because he's old doesn't mean he can't be part of the family.
Well, it's a tradition.
I promise you, north, grandpa wants this as much as anyone. Right, grandpa?
Yeah, right. I've been looking forward to this.
As the family made
their long trek to the sea,
north took the opportunity
to get close to his
new grandpa,
which was easy,
since he had a tremendous
affection for old folks.
He found them warm,
understanding,
and, most importantly,
way too tired to yell.
Knowing his time
with grandpa was limited,
north tried to take in
all this wise old man
had to offer
about life in the tundra.
And another thing. Up here, if your mother says
"don't make a face because it could freeze in the position," you better take her seriously.
Can't you hang around a little longer?
There's so much you can teach me.
Next!
Goodbye.
Yeah, o.K. O.K.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Let's go. I only got four months of sunlight.
Next. Let's go!
Come on. Come on.
Should've done this before.
I've got a civilization to run here.
Move along.
Next!
Don't act like you don't know what's going on.
Well, goodbye, north.
Are you sure you have to go?
Don't worry about him, north.
He's had a great life.
He's happy to set sail before he starts embarrassing himself.
Take it from us, north.
When drool hardens, it's not a pretty sight.
Let's go, pal.
This is no surprise.
Take a walk. Let's go. Move it.
Yeah, bye, bye.
Fine. Thank you.
Bye, dad!
Bye, dad!
Bye.
Listen, if there's a change in policy the next couple of weeks, feel free to track me down.
What did he say?
What do you say we grab a ride home?
Great idea!
North, don't worry about grandpa.
He'll be o.K.
Yeah.
Can I ride on top?
Why, sure. It's the best view.
Landscape sure is beautiful up here.
Hey...
It's you.
No, it's not.
Oh.
Smell that fresh air.
No smog up here.
How could they do that?
Not even my original parents would send my grandpa away like that.
Hey, son!
How's the view up there?
Great!
Thanks.
"Son."
I don't want to overstep my bounds, but unless I'm mistaken, you're that fella north.
Unless I'm further mistaken, you have a deadline of labor day... a week from tomorrow... to choose new parents.
You still haven't found what you're looking for.
How could labor day be next week?
I just got here.
You walked from home to the ice floes?
It's a seven-week walk, even with the wind at your back.
No wonder we stopped for lunch 49 times.
That six months of daylight thing throws everybody off.
I only showered 12 times during the seventies.
Oh, man, I'll never find new parents.
You can always go back to your original parents.
Oh, yeah!
That's just what I want to do... go back to the people who haven't even tried to contact me.
Take me to the airport.
I've got lots to do and not much time.
You got it. Yah!
So a now-desperate north,
with time running out,
raced towards
an uncertain future.
Understandably, he was upset
that his parents hadn't
called in two months,
but his parents hadn't
done much of anything
in two months.
As curator of the Smithsonian institution, it is my distinct honor to unveil the newest addition to our illustrious hall of achievement.
At 78 consecutive days and counting, the longest simultaneous coma in medical history, ladies and gentlemen, north's folks.
I'll now take questions.
Yes!
How can you equate a medical oddity with man's landing on the moon?
With all due respect to the achievements of the Apollo 11 crew, the sociological impact of what these folks did dwarfs those of Mr. Armstrong et Al.
All they did was faint.
And in so doing, shifted the familial balance of power throughout the world.
"Throughout the world"?
This is even bigger than we thought.
It's bigger than you thought.
That's why you're only going to be president.
...Child's continuing process to improve status...
I just thought of something.
What if they wake up in the next eight days, begging north to come back?
What if north goes back to his folks?
Arthur, don't you know that that's an impossibility, that I would use all my power to prevent a thing like that from happening?
Oh.
What do you say we grab some Chinese?
Maybe the msg will calm you down.
Despite north's growing concern
about his approaching deadline,
he took solace in the fact
the lord needed
only six days to create
the entire universe.
A kid of his caliber,
given an extra two days,
should be able to find
two measly parents.
Greetings...
North.
I'm thy new father, and this good woman, who art my wife, art thy new mother.
And these art thy new brothers, who art named Ezekiel.
And these art thy new brothers, who art named art.
Hey, hey, this looks great.
I've always dreamt of a life without the ever-present nuisance of electricity.
Just let me grab something from the plane.
I seem to have left my butter churn in the overhead compartment.
Floor it!
While it wasn't like north
to make snap judgments,
there were only
seven days left.
He had a world of potential
parents to evaluate.
Long live the north dynasty!
Give him the emperor cut.
Honey!
Honey face!
You seem like very nice folks, but to be totally honest with you, if I lived here,
I'm not sure I'd get much homework done.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Quiet, Harry! Quiet!
I think he's trying
to tell us something.
Â¶ Wack wack wack-ado Â¶Â¶
Oh, my!
With three days to go
before his 12 noon
labor day deadline,
north, the little
world traveler,
arrived in New York today
to interview his final
set of parents...
ward and Donna Nelson,
who, along with their
two children, bud and Laura,
live in the quaint
upstate town of bedford.
When contacted earlier
at his office,
ward, the local pediatrician,
who, we understand,
still makes house calls,
said, "my family and I
would like nothing better
"than to see north's
long journey
"finally be rewarded with
a warm and loving home,
and we hope we can
provide it for him."
Thanks.
Hi, north!
Ward, bud, Laura, he's here!
He's here!
Hi, north!
Hi!
Hello.
Welcome to our home, son.
Tired, hungry?
I'm going to bake you some chocolate chip cookies.
Do you like Nintendo?
Today at mount rushmore,
thousands of angry parents
gathered
to voice opposition to the bill
that lowers voting age to 7.
According to Arthur belt,
the rising politician
who drafted the bill...
Wait. They were talking about me.
Soon you'll be hearing your name so much, even you'll be sick of it.
I highly doubt it.
Talk to me.
Boss, it's Al with the sleeping dogs.
Yeah, what about them?
Looks like they counted their last sheep.
So it does.
How long will it take to get operation xerox into place?
Less than a minute, boss.
Go to it, and, Al?
Yeah, boss?
Don't be surprised if there's extra zeros in your next paycheck.
Thanks, boss. I appreciate it.
And, Al?
Yeah, boss?
Don't be surprised if there isn't.
I understand.
Good morning.
Where are we?
Oh! Where's our son?
Ooh! Can we see our son?
Absolutely. Just follow me.
We got a limo waiting outside with coffee and hot Danish.
Oh, that sounds good.
I seem to have worked up an appetite. Honey?
I could eat.
Right this way.
Hike!
O.K., Laura, sack the quarterback!
Here we go. Hey!
Touchdown!
You faked me right out of my socks!
Come and get it!
It's great having you here, north.
I've always wanted a brother to throw to.
Now I have two brothers to look out for me.
I know we're all excited to have north in our family, but he hasn't decided to stay.
You got to stay!
We really want you.
Help yourself, everybody. Dig in.
Mom, can we go to the carnival tomorrow?
I don't see why not.
Ward?
Sounds good to me.
North...
We miss you so much.
Please forgive us.
We made so many mistakes.
We should've appreciated you more.
If only you could give us just one more chance.
We love you, son.
We love you very much.
Cut!
Very nice.
Very, very nice.
Touching, moving, and yet, not over the top.
Keep it rolling.
So, crazy summer, huh?
Oh, terrible.
Very disturbing.
I know what you're going through, but if north doesn't come back, you can always adopt.
Just the other day,
I met this adorable little boy,
7 years old.
His name was Hugh.
Maybe you can adopt him.
Maybe Hugh can be your son.
We don't want Hugh.
He's not our son.
We want north.
I understand.
It was insensitive of me to even mention it.
Uh, you folks want more coffee?
Nah. That's o.K.
Not for me.
I still don't understand why we can't speak to north in person.
I think that would be a big mistake.
North is very angry right now, very sensitive.
You show up unannounced, and this could blow up in your face, and it'd just kill me to see that happen.
My suggestion is, you lay low for a while.
I'll have someone escort you to the Plaza.
I told Jean Pierre to give you any room service, and as north's best friend,
I'd happily show him this tape to pave the way for you.
Thank you, winchell.
Oh, yes.
You're a real friend.
I try.
Bring the car around for north's folks.
Yes, sir. Consider it done.
You know, you're doing very well for a sixth-grader.
Well, I cut a few breaks.
Adam, take the tape down to editing.
Colonel mustard in the study with the rope.
I don't have any of those.
Neither do I.
Me, neither.
Let's see.
Colonel mustard in the study, and here's the rope.
All right!
Good job, kitten.
Can we play again?
No. You have to hit the sack.
You don't want to be tired for the carnival.
Everybody upstairs to bed right now.
O.K. Good night.
Good night, honey.
Good night, north.
Good night.
Brush your teeth before you go to bed.
Ahem.
Sorry to bother you, but I got something important for a kid named north.
What is it?
Apparently an urgent message from his original parents.
I'll see he gets it.
Thank you.
North, honey?
Yeah?
Can you come down here for a minute?
Coming.
What is it?
North, a man just left this tape.
It's a message from your parents.
From my parents?
Do you mind if I... of course not.
Would you like to be alone, north?
No. That's o.K.
After all you've been through,
what would you like
to say to your son?
We don't want Hugh.
How can you say that?
He's not our son.
Aren't you bothered
you might never see
your son again?
Nah. That's o.K.
Isn't this a gut-wrenching,
torturous, emotional
experience?
Not for me.
He's not our son.
We don't want Hugh.
North, honey, are you o.K.?
Is there anything we can do for you?
Yeah.
Let me be your son.
Finally, north
had new parents...
parents who made him
feel wanted, secure,
and loved,
yet something was still wrong.
The nelsons were everything
he was looking for,
so why couldn't he
embrace them?
North needed answers.
North, we just don't understand why you're leaving.
Neither do I.
You're all nice people.
I'm really gonna miss you, but I've just got to be alone.
We're going to miss you, too.
And so will Oliver.
North.
Here.
In case you get hungry on your way to New York.
Thanks, mom...
I mean, Mrs. Nelson.
Bye.
So with just 24 hours until
his labor day deadline,
no hope of parents,
and the prospect
of an orphanage looming,
north felt he only
had one option left.
He would disappear.
Can you spare some extra change?
Oh.
Here.
Maybe it'll bring you more luck than it brought me.
Hey, it's got a hole in it!
What good does this do me?
Yes, he would disappear,
and where better to do that
than amidst the teeming,
faceless masses
of the naked city?
Want to go downtown?
Shut up!
He's heading into the park.
Don't worry, boss. I'm just looking for the right place.
So long, Al.
What was that all about?
It seems our young friend's had a change of heart.
Change of heart?
He's left the nelsons and decided to grace our city with his presence.
Oh, no.
This ruins everything.
Arthur, please, use your head.
This is a godsend.
It is?
Of course.
As we speak, grownups across this great land of ours are feeling humiliated.
They blame north for all their frustrations.
Do you realize how many of those angry parents would like nothing better than to do away with our little friend?
And do you know the one catalyst that can give a political movement true cohesion?
That's right.
A martyr.
You're a genius.
I mean, it's brilliant.
It's absolutely winchellian.
It... it...
But for north to be martyred, doesn't he have to be killed?
Well, maybe we'll get lucky.
As north ran for his life,
he wondered how his dream
of finding perfect parents
had turned into a nightmare.
Aah! Aah!
Damn it.
Psst! North.
Over here.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Listen to me very carefully.
I'm not here. You never saw me.
We're not even having this conversation.
Got that?
Got what?
Perfect.
So what are we not talking about?
This.
What? I don't see anything.
What you don't see is a tape of the conversation winchell had with your parents.
I saw it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, I forgot. I didn't see it.
You did see it, and this is what you didn't see.
I see.
I don't think you do.
Look at the tape.
So how'd you find me?
Winchell. He bugged the nelsons' phones.
Winchell? Shh!
He's everywhere.
I been working for him ever since you left home.
You know, some guy was chasing me with a gun.
He was shooting at me.
That didn't have anything to do with winchell, did it?
Oh, man.
So why are you doing this?
I'm not, but if I was, because I think winchell's gone too far.
Also, you were always good to me, north.
You never picked me last.
You never made me play right field.
Thanks, Adam.
Oh, man.
Adam, I just don't feel safe anywhere.
Adam?
Adam?
Can I have a hot dog with just mustard?
That'll be $1.00.
Out of 5.
There you go.
Where did you get this?
Some bum bought a hot dog from me. Why?
No reason.
Aah!
Aah!
We won't see him no more.
Watch, watch, watch!
Watch there.
Excuse me.
Move it, kid.
Come on, move it.
Which reminds me of this man that walked into a bar.
He sits down next to a very beautiful young lady.
Before you know it, the conversation turns to sex.
He says to her,
"my darling, do you smoke after making love?"
She says, "I don't know.
I never looked."
"But I'll tell you one thing, my smoke alarm never went off."
Good night, folks.
You've been great.
Thank you.
You the kid with the tape?
Yeah.
Good. Come in. I want to try my new vcr.
How did you know?
I came to see you because you looked familiar.
I look familiar because
I'm almost famous.
Joey fingers, and you're?
North.
One of my favorite directions.
Mal-o-mar?
No, thanks.
That bad, huh?
What?
No kid ever refuses a mal-o-mar unless he's wrestling with heavyweight problems.
North, we miss you so much.
Please forgive us.
We made so many mistakes.
We should've
appreciated you more.
If only you could give us just one more chance.
We love you, son.
We love you very much.
Beautiful. Works like a charm.
You got some pretty nice folks there, kid.
Huh?
I said you got some pretty nice folks there.
Yeah.
I guess so.
What do you mean?
What did they mean by "give us one more chance?"
I thought they didn't love me.
What are you, nuts?
That's the thing.
They didn't always pay that much attention to me.
I left them to find folks who'd appreciate me.
I searched the whole world, but nobody was good enough... not even the nelsons, who I just left, and they weren't bad folks.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with you.
I'm sure the nelsons weren't bad folks.
They just weren't your folks.
You see those people out there?
That audience?
They paid attention to me.
They listened.
They laughed. They screamed.
They applauded.
They loved me, but do you think that audience would make me a cup of tea if I'm ill?
You think they're going to give me advice when I fight with my best friend or I get in girl trouble?
Who will I turn to?
Give you a hint.
It's not that audience.
My God, what have I done?
I'll tell you what you've done.
You've realized something it takes most people a whole lifetime to figure out... that a bird in the hand is always greener than the grass under the other guy's bushes.
It's a metaphor used mostly by gardeners and landscape people in general.
Hey, kid!
Hey, kid! Where are you going?
Home. I miss my parents.
How? You got a car?
No. I'm 11.
Then we better take mine.
The white zone
if for immediate loading
and unloading
of passengers only.
No parking.
Thanks for everything,
Mr. Fingers.
Make it Joey, and you're welcome.
Remember, if you can't stand the heat, leave Miami.
What does that metaphor mean?
What metaphor? You ever been there in August?
Your balls stick to your leg like crazy glue.
So north finally found
the parents
he'd always been looking for.
Much to his surprise,
they were his own.
So with a smile on his face,
north prepared to board
the final plane home.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going home.
Not on this plane.
Why not?
It says here you're dead.
But I'm not.
How can I be sure?
I'm here talking to you.
I know. That scares me.
I don't scare easily.
Imagine how it will affect the other passengers.
But I'm not dead.
Sorry. I can't take that chance.
Hey, it's north. He's alive.
What's he doing here?
This plane's headed to his hometown.
He's trying to reach his parents.
It'll ruin everything.
Let's get him!
Hey!
He's going up that way!
Stop him! Stop him!
Get that traitor!
Hey, kid, hop in.
What are you, some kind of guardian angel?
Well, I guess you can say that
'cause we at federal express feel we are guardians... guardians of your most important packages and priority communiques.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just get me home, will you?
Well, if you absolutely positively have to be home by tomorrow morning, you've come to the right truck.
Man, you don't let up for a second.
I have no idea what you mean.
I have no idea what you mean.
Just tell me what to do.
Get in.
Federal express, huh?
O.K. Thanks.
Oh, Al.
Can I have a word with you?
Oh. Sure, boss.
Remember when you told me north was dead?
Yeah.
Uh, just curious... what'd you base that on?
I can only assume that you think this is blood, and if I had an I.Q. Below
24, I might think the same, but the stain in this cap comes from borscht.
Borscht?
Yes, borscht... a beef-based soup,
Russian in origin, most frequently served chilled with a dollop of sour cream.
I make a good borscht.
And I'd love to sample it someday, but the point I'm making here is that unless north's head was filled with this traditional slavic delicacy, he's not dead, you idiot!
Oh, no!
Not now, Arthur.
All right. This just calls for a slight change in plans.
I'll take it from here.
All right.
Sign on the fourth line.
What time is it?
Normally my answer would be no later than 10:30, but thanks to that jackknifed truck,
I'm sorry to say it's 10 of 12:00.
We'll be happy to refund your... no, that's o.K.
Mom! Dad!
I'm home!
Mom!
Where are you guys?
Mom? Dad?
Mom?
Mom?
Hello, north. Happy labor day.
I trust your summer was enjoyable.
Where are my folks?
Oh, they're in a safe place.
Where the hell are my parents?
North! Did you say the word hell?
The summer's really broadened you.
Winchell, I've got exactly 10 minutes to find my parents.
If you don't tell me where they are,
I'll show you how broadened I've become, you little asshole!
Why are you smiling?
I was thinking what a beautiful heartwarming scene it's going to be when you're reunited with your parents at your secret spot.
How do you know about my secret spot?
I'm a journalist, north.
It's my job to know about these things, and as much as I'm enjoying this chat, shouldn't you be on your way?
After all, you're down to... Nine minutes.
Where is he?
Winchell said he'd be here by now.
Don't worry, honey.
He'll be here soon.
Soon may not be good enough.
I've been sent here by the court to ensure that your son's physically in your arms by 12:00 noon.
How much time is left?
Six minutes.
And that's my own clock from my own house.
Uh!
Maybe we should go look for him.
No, no, honey.
What if we leave here and north shows up?
Relax, honey.
Winchell's a man of his word.
Hey, watch yourself, kid.
He has less than one minute.
You wait here.
I'll look for him.
Bad idea. The ruling stipulates north's supposed to be in the arms of both parents.
That's two parents and four arms.
If one of you leaves... the math speaks for itself.
Mom! Dad!
North!
Aah!
Hey.
You still here?
Yeah.
I must've fallen asleep.
Come on. I'll give you a ride home.
And then you were a beach bum.
Then you drove a sleigh.
Then you were a comedian who said my parents were the best for me.
I said that? I must be a pretty smart guy.
What's that?
Oh, nothing.
Just something I've always had, you know, for good luck.
Maybe good luck for you.
I bet that eagle's whistling a different tune.
Here we go.
35 maple drive.
Thanks a lot, mister.
Don't mention it, kid.
And remember, be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.
With the possible exception of Vegas when Sinatra's in town. Bye.
North!
North!
Mom! Dad!
Where were you?
We were worried sick.
I fell asleep in the mall.
We called the hospitals.
We called the police.
Oh, we looked everywhere.
You did?
Of course we did.
We love you so much, north.
If anything ever happened to you,
I don't know what we'd do.
I love you guys, too.
Come on.
You hungry, honey?
A little bit.
A little bit?
O.K., a lot.
O.K. You run upstairs, put on your pajamas, we'll bring something up for you.
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?
I'll get drive-through.
You're counting on the Winged Avenger to deliver you from evil...
...aren't you, my friend?
Are you going to kill me?
Maybe, maybe not.
We're of two minds on the subject.
Are you a gambling man?
Let's say we flip for it?
One man is born a hero, his brother a coward.
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...
...holy men are martyred, and junkies grow legion.
Why?
Why, why, why, why, why?
Luck!
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah...
...clueless luck!
The random toss...
...is the only true justice.
Let's see what justice has in store...
...for you.
It's like the touch of God.
Wait, wait, wait.
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.
In your case, beer and pizza.
Out of here, guys!
-But you said you'd let me live!
-Too true!
And so you shall! Nothing's better than live bait to trap a bat.
Hot entrance.
Two-Face?
Two guards are dead.
He's holding a third hostage.
Didn't see this one coming.
We should have.
The Second Bank of Gotham--
Second anniversary of the day I captured him.
How could he resist?
I'm Chase Meridian.
I asked her to come here to consult on the case. She specializes in--
Abnormal psychology, multiple personalities. I read your work.
Insightful.
Naive, but insightful.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a superhero's night table.
Can we reason with him?
-He's got innocent people up there.
-It won't do any good.
-He'll slaughter them without a thought.
-Agreed.
A trauma powerful enough to create an alternate personality leaves one--
In a world where normal rules of right and wrong no longer apply.
Exactly.
Like you.
I could write a hell of a paper on a man who dresses like a flying rodent.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Really? I didn't know that.
You are interesting.
And call me Chase.
By the way, do you have a first name, or do I call you Bats?
Let's start this party with a bang!
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!
Kill the Bat!
Blast him!
Open sesame.
It's a trap!
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!
When we open that safe, we'll have everything we ever wanted:
Enough cash to rain down upon fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.
And, of course...
...you, my boy, dead!
It's boiling acid!
For your dying pleasure, we are serving the acid that made us the men we are!
No!
-Hold on.
-Yes!
Haul away!
Yes! Haul away!
-Give me your hand.
-Don't let go!
I must borrow this.
That's my hearing aid!
Thanks.
Wow! My shoes are melting!
No more!
Hang on.
Hang on?
Get him down.
Get him down.
Take it easy with him.
You'll be all right. Just stay calm.
This'll fix him!
Hang on, Batty!
Let's see.
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, happy day!
Farewell forever to that...
...pointy-eared night rat!
Face!
You need help. Give it up.
Have the good taste to die!
See you!
Despite a valiant effort last night by Batman...
...Harvey Two-Face is still at large and extremely dangerous.
In other news today...
...billionaire Bruce Wayne extended his profit-sharing program...
...to the employees of the successful electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.
Mr. Wayne.
Your inspections are a departmental highlight.
Oh, my God, it's him.
I am a winner. I am a winner.
I am a winner.
I am a winner.
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.
Perhaps we should get to R & D as soon as possible.
Mister...?
Oh, Bruce Wayne.
No, that's my name. And you are?
Nygma.
Edward.
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.
Just like I tell everyone.
We've never actually met, but your name was on the hiring slip. I have it.
I need that hand back.
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry.
It's just that...
...you're my idol.
Back to work.
And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Back to work.
It's okay.
What's on your mind?
Precisely.
What's on all our minds?
Brain waves.
The future...
...of Wayne Enterprises...
...is brain waves.
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.
-I terminated his project today.
-It's okay.
I have it!
My invention...
...beams any TV signal directly into the human brain.
By stimulating neurons, manipulating brain waves...
...this device makes the audience feel like they're inside the show.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?
Yes.
But...
...someone like you would never need it.
Someone so...
...intelligent, witty and...
...charming.
I need a bit of additional funding for human trials. Let me show you, please!
Now, listen...
...l want a full set of technical schematics on this, okay?
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.
Look at us! Two of a kind!
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.
That's not...
...going to be good for me.
I need an answer now.
I think I deserve it.
I'm sorry, then the answer is no.
Tampering with people's brain waves...
...mind manipulation...
...it just raises too many questions.
Sorry.
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.
All right, everyone!
Back to work!
We'll discuss this later!
You were supposed to understand.
I'll make you understand.
Lock.
Chair.
I saw the signal.
All is ready.
Commissioner?
He's at home.
I sent the signal.
What's wrong?
Last night at the bank I noticed something about Two-Face:
His coin.
It's his Achilles' heel.
It can be exploited.
I know.
You called me for this?
The Batsignal is not a beeper.
I wish I could say that my interest in you was...
...purely professional.
Are you trying to get under my cape?
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.
It's the car, right? Chicks love it.
What is it about the wrong kind of man?
In grade school: guys with earrings.
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.
Now...
...black rubber.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.
We all wear masks.
My life's an open book. You read?
I don't blend in at a family picnic.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...
...you bring your scarred psyche.
Direct, aren't you?
You like strong women.
I've done my homework.
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?
I haven't had much luck with women.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman.
I saw the signal.
-What's going on?
-Nothing.
False alarm.
Are you sure?
Women.
Now I've got it!
"Too many questions.
There's too many questions.
"Too many...."
I'll show you it works!
What the hell is going on here?
I told you this project is terminated!
I'm calling Security!
Caffeine will kill you!
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.
What are you doing?
Untie me!
This won't hurt.
At least, I don't think it will.
What are you doing?
You touch that switch and--
This?
Losing resolution.
More power!
Edward Nygma...
...come on down!
You're the next contestant on...
...Brain Drain!
I'll take what's inside thick skull number one!
What have we got for him?
Oh, Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough!
And a breakdown? Maybe!
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.
No, several geniuses.
A gaggle, a swarm...
...a flock of freaking Freuds!
Riddle me this, Fred.
What is everything to someone...
...and nothing to everyone else?
Your mind, baby!
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!
"I'm sucking up your IQ
"Vacuuming your cortex
"Feeding off your brain"
What a rush!
What the hell just happened?
A very surprising side effect.
While you were mesmerized by my 3-D TV...
...l utilized your neural energy to grow smarter.
Bruce Wayne was right!
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!
It is brain manipulation!
I'm reporting you to the FCC!
The human experimentation board!
The AMl!
And the police!
You are going up on charges...
...to court, to jail...
...and then to a mental institution for the rest of your life!
But, first and foremost,
Nygma, you are fired!
Do you hear me? Fired!
I don't think so.
Help!
Hang on!
Babe!
You are fired!
Or should I say...
...terminated?
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!
Nice form, but rough on the landing.
He may have to settle for the Bronze.
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?
My work raises too many questions?
Why hasn't anybody...
...put you in your place?
Harvey Dent, once Gotham's District Attorney...
...was horribly scarred by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.
Although Batman tried to save him...
...Dent's left-brain damage turned him into a violent criminal...
...who blamed Batman and who has vowed to destroy him.
Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous, repeat, extremely dangerous.
That was the Commissioner.
There's been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.
Horrible way to die.
The surveillance cameras are down here.
We'll dredge the river, but with that current, I doubt we'll find the body.
Why?
Oh, why?
I just can't believe it.
Two years working in the same office.
He was like my father...
...my brother...
...or a cousin that visits a lot.
Get a grip, Edward.
I found this in my cubicle.
You'll find the handwriting matches his, as does the sentence structure.
I couldn't possibly continue on here.
The memories....
This is last night's security log.
There's Stickley.
Pretty cut and dry.
Yes, definitely suicide.
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.
Suicide's not covered by our corporate insurance policy.
I know. Full benefits.
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?
I'll let you know. What's this?
I don't know.
I didn't see anyone.
"If you look at the numbers on my face...
"...you won't find 13 anyplace."
That's hideous.
What does it mean?
It's a riddle.
"Numbers on my face...13."
One through twelve.
The answer is a clock.
Who would send you a riddle?
That, Maggie...
...is the riddle.
Guess what I did today?
Wayne Manor.
See you soon.
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.
I...guess I'm early.
I have an appointment.
I'm Bruce Wayne.
Good.
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.
I'm sorry.
You...sounded like you were in...
...you know, trouble.
I prefer healthy expressions of violence as opposed to breaking in.
So...
...how can I help you?
Someone's been sending me love letters.
One at my office and one at my home.
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your opinion.
A clock.
Clock.
"Tear one off and scratch my head.
"What once was red is black instead."
A match.
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
Patient may suffer from obsession...
...with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?
So, what you're saying is...
...this guy's a total wacko.
Exactly.
He's obsessed with you.
His only escape may be to purge the fixation.
To kill me.
I think you understand obsession better than you let on.
You like bats?
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.
An inkblot.
People see what they want.
The question is: do you like bats?
Still playing with dolls?
She's a Malaysian dream warden.
Some cultures believe she protects you from bad dreams.
It's silly to you, I'm sure.
You look so sad.
Do you need one?
Me? No. Why would l?
You're not exactly what you seem, are you?
What is it you really came here for?
Yikes, time's up.
That's usually my line.
I'd love to stay here chatting--
Would you?
I'm not so sure.
I must get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me?
And into a black dress.
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...boys and girls of all ages...
...welcome to the greatest show on earth!
Who is this beautiful young woman you're with?
Dr. Chase Meridian.
A doctor?
What kind of doctor?
...for Gotham Children's Hospital.
Let's thank our largest single donor:
Bruce Wayne!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...70 feet above the ground...
...performing feats of unimaginable aerial skill...
...the Flying Graysons!
Listen...
...l'm going rock climbing this weekend.
Would you like to join me?
I'd like to.
I love climbing. I really love it.
But?
I've met someone.
That's fast work. You just moved here.
You could say he just...
...dropped out of the sky and...
...bang!
I think he felt it too.
He sure did.
What?
Who wouldn't?
Now...
...Richard...
...the youngest Flying Grayson...
...will perform the awe-inspiring...
...death drop...
...without the safety...
...of a net!
Let's go.
You'll be okay.
Ladies...
...and gentlemen!
Now, the new management of the circus invites you to forget...
...this good, wholesome fun...
...andjoin us in a celebration of absolute chaos...
...and truejesters!
Bring it on!
Now!
Tonight, a new act for your...
...personal amazement.
We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top. "
Let us direct your attention to the ring.
Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...
...that's two hundred sticks of TNT.
And in our innocent hand...
...a radio detonator.
What do you want?
Want, Mr. Mayor?
One simple thing: Batman.
Bruised, broken, bleeding...
...in a word: dead!
Batman.
Who do we have before us?
Gotham's finest...
...well-to-do...
...influential.
Surely one ofyou knows who Batman is.
Hell, odds are one ofyou pasty-faced twits is Batman!
You have two minutes.
Harvey!
I'm Batman!
We can stop them.
Go out on the rigging.
Be careful.
Don't worry.
Go to work, boys!
Our kind of day.
Reach for it! Stop it!
Oh, my God.
It's good you took him in.
He hasn't anyone now.
He's filled out papers all day.
He hasn't slept or eaten.
Welcome, Master Grayson.
I'm Alfred.
How're you doing, Al?
There's a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.
Okay, I'm out of here.
Excuse me?
Telling that cop I'd stay here...
...saved me a lot of social-service interviews.
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.
Take it easy.
Where will you go? The circus must be halfway to Metropolis.
Get a fix on Two-Face.
Then I'll kill him.
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.
It'll make it worse.
Spare me the sermons, all right?
I don't need your advice or your charity.
Nice bike.
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?
You're almost on empty.
Fill it up in the garage.
There's no gas station for miles.
The pump's over here.
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?
That's a 1917 Harley.
Yep.
Indian Classic, fully restored.
This is a Vincent Black Knight.
They only made a hundred.
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.
You've got two.
That one doesn't run.
The throttle sticks on this one.
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...
...these need a lot of work.
If someone were to fix them up...
...they could keep one.
Anyway...
...have a nice trip.
You'll land on your feet.
Is the young master leaving?
Pity.
I'll just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.
Hey, Al, wait up.
Master Bruce?
Just like my parents.
It's happening again.
A monster comes out of the night, a scream, two shots.
I killed them.
What did you say?
He killed them.
Two-Face.
He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No, no.
You said, "I killed them."
Take care of the kid.
Certainly, sir.
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?
No.
Thanks, I won't be staying long.
Is this a robin?
My brother's wire broke once and I swung out and grabbed him.
My father said I was his hero.
I flew in like a robin.
Some hero I turned out to be.
But your father was right.
You are a hero. I can tell.
Throw this away, will you?
I won't need it anymore.
I think I'll just put it in here.
Broken wings mend in time.
One day Robin will fly again.
I promise.
We'll drive.
The Puzzler?
The Gamester?
Captain Kill?
Question Mark Man?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...
...is driving us insane!
Don't worry, baby.
You'll kill him soon.
Besides...
...l made your favorite:
Sparkling champagne and...
...yummy poached salmon with little quail eggs and...
...a creamy...
...dreamy...
...lemon souffle.
No, I made your favorite:
A charred heart of black boar...
...a side of raw donkey meat...
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol, straight up, baby!
Perfect!
Ladies, you spoil us!
We're of two minds about what to eat first.
What?
I hope you made extra.
Who the hell are you?
Just a friend.
But you can call me...
...The Riddler.
I'll call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us? Talk!
But then if I talked, what would keep you from slaying me, O Segregated One?
That's never going to heal if you don't stop picking.
Let's see if you bleed green.
It's not me you want to kill.
That's just too easy for someone as powerful as you and...
...you.
But Batman...
...there's a challenge.
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.
But have you thought it through? A few bullets, a splash of blood, then what?
Wet hands.
Post-homicidal depression.
Why not humiliate him first?
Yeah.
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is at his weakest...
...crush him!
I see that...
...sparkle in your left eye.
I can help you get Batman.
That is, if you'll...
...spare my life for just a few moments.
Thank you.
I love what you've done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.
Beautiful.
It's so dark and Gothic and...
...disgustingly decadent.
Yet so bright and chipper and...
...conservative.
It's so you!
And yet, so you!
Very few people are both a summer and a winter, but...
...but you pull it off nicely.
What's the point?
Has anyone ever told you, you have a serious impulse-control problem?
This is the point.
This is how I found you.
Let me demonstrate.
This is your brain on The Box.
This is my brain on The Box.
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?
I'll have more.
There's more. But only the first one's free.
Here's the bargain:
You'll help me steal production capital...
...so I can put a Box on every TV in town...
...and become Gotham's cleverest, carbon-based life form!
And in return....
Is everybody paying attention?
I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.
The mother of all riddles:
Who is...
...Batman?
You broke into our hideout.
You violated the sanctity of our lair.
We should crush your bones into powder.
But you pose an interesting proposition.
Therefore, heads: we accept, and tails: we blow your damn head off.
Here's a good one.
No, no, no!
There is a good one.
-Leave that. I'll attend to it.
-I'm not used to being waited on.
Don't shoot me!
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!
It's dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...
...and assert yourself.
That looks fun. Let me try.
Ball up the fist, reach way back... assert yourself.
One hundred thousand, two hundred and twenty.
One hundred and....
I lost count!
Last night another robbery, perpetrated by the Green-Suited Menace...
...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen, with no sign of Batman.
Teamed with Two-Face, this new criminal's pattern...
...of marking his crimes with puzzles has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.
Apparently, you and Batman have a common enemy.
That was with the morning mail.
"The eight of us go forth, not back.
"To protect our king from the foe's attack."
Chess pawns.
Clock.
Matches.
All physical, man-made objects.
Small in size, light in weight.
What's the connection?
With all due respect, that's why they call him The Riddler.
May I help you?
Why is this the only locked door?
What's back there?
Master Wayne's dead wives.
The silver closet. On your way.
Now, you can be part of the action!
Nygma Tech brings thejoy of 3-D entertainment into your home!
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...
...my vision.
The Box in every home in America...
...and one day, the world!
In local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...
...has become the rage of Gotham.
Rioting occurred last night at electronic stores that were sold out.
There is hardly a home without the Nygma Tech Box.
Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites into zombies.
But Edward Nygmajust shrugs.
"That's what they said when TV was invented. "
Master Dick!
Up here.
Just checking, young sir.
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
I have something for you. It's on the table.
I hope you like it.
Call it clinical intuition.
I thought your dreams needed changing.
My parents were murdered before me...
...when I was a kid.
I don't...
...remember a lot of what happened, but...
...what I do comes to me in my dreams.
Flashes.
There's a new element now, though,
I haven't seen before.
It's a red leather book.
Something else....
My dreams come to me when I'm awake now.
Bruce, you're describing repressed memories.
Images of a forgotten pain that's trying to surface.
I'll be right back.
Is it possible there's an aspect of your parents' death you haven't faced?
You were so young when it happened.
Maybe I should leave you two alone.
This goes way beyond taking your work home, doesn't it?
All right.
I think he's fascinating.
Clinically.
Why does a man do this?
It's as if he's cursed to pay a penance.
What crime could he have committed to deserve a life of nightly torture?
It's more than just...
...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?
Bruce, are you jealous?
No.
I can't be jealous of Batman.
I want to be close, but you won't let me near.
What are you protecting me from?
Do you want to know me?
Do you want to know who I am?
I guess...
...we're all two people.
The one in daylight, and the one we keep in shadow.
Rage...
...violence...
...passion.
Excuse me.
I'm busy.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I have some distressing news about Dick.
Is he okay?
I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?
Not the Jaguar.
The other car.
The Bentley?
No, sir.
The other car.
Come for a little ride in my love machine, babies?
It's Batman!
Open up, Batman.
Wait!
That's not Batman!
What do you mean?
That's Batboy!
It ain't the Bat!
Let her go!
Who the hell are you?
I'm Batman.
I forgot my suit, all right?
Come on, run!
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?
Go!
Thanks, you saved my life!
I could definitely get into this superhero gig.
Batman!
Bastard!
It should've been you!
If you had told Two-Face who you were at the circus...
...they'd still be alive!
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life for your family, he would have.
All I can think about every day is getting Two-Face.
He took my whole life.
When I was out there tonight...
...l imagined it was him I was fighting...
...even when I was fighting you...
...and the pain went away.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
Good.
You must help me find him.
When we do...
...l'm the one who kills him.
So, you're willing to take a life?
As long as it's Two-Face.
Then it will happen this way:
You make the kill.
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey, it grows.
So you run into the night to find another face, and another...
...and another...
...until one terrible morning you wake up and realize...
...that revenge has become your whole life...
...and you won't know why.
You can't understand.
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.
Yes, they were.
We're the same.
If we're the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.
No.
I can't.
You still have a choice.
Look, Bruce...
...l'm a part of this, whether you like it or not.
Tonight all of Gotham society has turned out for Edward Nygma's...
...gala unveiling of his New lmproved Box.
Thanks, Al.
My pleasure, sir.
They'll be dining and dancing the night away...
...on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.
What's it like to have your face on the cover of every magazine?
Edward, how does it feel to be the city's newest, most-eligible bachelor?
Gotham must know!
There's Bruce Wayne!
Brucie!
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!
How come you don't look so good in that suit?
Shut up. You're here to work!
How's my mole?
Fine.
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech takeover of Wayne Enterprises?
Nygma Tech stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises two to one.
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?
Bruce, old man.
The press wonders what it's like to be outsold, outclassed, out-coifed and...
...generally outdone in every way.
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.
Great party. Nice suit.
Wit. Good.
And you are?
Chase.
And what a grand pursuit you must be.
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?
You can call me anything you want.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the future!
My New lmproved Box offers fully-interactive holographic fantasies.
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.
How do you create these images, hon?
That, my dear, is my little secret.
Fully-interactive holographs.
Only a high-frequency carrier wave, beamed into the brain...
...could create such images.
And you wish you thought of it.
Don't be a sore loser.
Step inside. Give it a try.
If you can introduce images into the mind, what stops you from...
...extracting images out of the mind?
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.
Shall we dance?
Naughty, naughty.
Looking for something?
I was just wondering how you turn it off.
Clever.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Relax.
Tell me your...
...dreams.
Tell me...
...your fantasies.
Tell me your secrets.
Tell me...
...your deepest...
...darkest...
...fears.
Relax, folks!
It's only an old-fashioned, low-tech stickup!
We're interested in the basics:
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.
Hand them over nice and quietly, and no one will be hurt!
Emergency, Alfred.
Yes, sir.
Be calm, everybody!
Just stay calm!
Excuse me!
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?
We're sick of waiting for you to deliver Batman.
Patience, O Bifurcated One.
Patience, hell! We want him dead!
And nothing brings out the Batman like a little murder and mayhem!
You could have let me in on the caper.
We could have organized it, planned it, pre-sold the movie rights!
Your entrance was good, his was better.
The difference?
Showmanship!
Emergency, Alfred.
Oh, sir....
I could be fired for this.
Perhaps they'll have me back at Buckingham Palace.
All right, boys! Phase Two!
My place, midnight.
Nothing like a bad case of gas!
Why can't you just die?
Hi.
What were you doing?
You got a real gratitude problem, you know that?
I need a name. Batboy? Knight Wing?
What's a good sidekick name?
"Dick Grayson, college student."
Screw you!
I saved your life. You owe me.
You're going to get yourself killed.
I'm your new partner.
No!
Whenever you go out at night, I'll be watching. Where Batman goes, I'll go.
How will you stop me?
I can stop you.
Hang this next to the Batsuit...
...where it belongs.
You're encouraging him.
Young men with a mind for revenge need little encouragement.
They need guidance.
You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose.
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.
Perhaps the lady is just what the doctor ordered.
She seems lovely and wise.
I've never been in love before.
Go to her.
Tell her how you feel.
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.
Let her decide.
I'm sorry.
I can't believe this.
I've imagined this moment since I first saw you.
Your eyes...
...your lips...
...your body.
Now I have you and...
...l'm wishing you were somebody else.
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.
I've met someone.
He's not you.
I hope you can understand.
I understand.
Well....
That's just what I said.
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:
How to map the human mind.
Would you like to see what Bruce Wayne has in his head?
Riddle me this:
What kind of man...
...has bats on the brain?
-Go ahead. You can say it.
-You're a genius.
Oh, stop.
So, from this day on...
...Batman is no more.
You can't just quit.
There's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.
I've dedicated my life to helping strangers
I've never met.
Faces I've never seen.
Well...
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.
You can't tell me what to do with the rest of my life.
My dad told me that every man goes his own way.
My way goes to Two-Face.
You must help me.
And if you do find Harvey...
...and then you kill him...
...what next?
Exactly.
Then you'd be alone, like me.
No, you must let this go.
Listen to me, I'm your friend.
I don't need a friend, I need a partner.
Two-Face has got to pay.
Please.
Chase is coming for dinner.
I'm going to tell her...
...everything.
Come upstairs. We'll talk.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
Happy Halloween.
Happy Halloween to you.
I asked you here tonight because there's something I wanted to tell you.
I wanted to tell you something too.
What I wanted--
Go ahead, you first.
Trick or treat!
All my life I have been...
...attracted to a certain kind of man.
The wrong kind.
Look at what I do for a living.
And since...
...since I met you, I....
Oh, God.
Why am I so nervous?
Don't eat too much tonight or you'll be sick in your beds.
Happy Halloween!
What's wrong?
It's happening again.
Flashes.
My parents' death.
Your memories are trying to break through.
I want to tell you something.
Something I've never told anyone.
It's all right.
It's all right. I'm here.
I'm here.
The night of my parents' wake...
...the priest's words gave no comfort.
Of course.
There, on my father's desk...
...the red book.
Hisjournal.
He'd written in it every day.
But now he'd never write in it again.
At that moment I knew...
...my life would never be the same.
I raced out into the storm...
...trying to outrun the rage.
The pain.
Then I fell.
I fell forever.
The cave was monstrous.
It must have been there for centuries.
And there...
...deep in the shadows...
...l saw....
It was coming toward me.
I was scared at first, but only at first.
The figure in the dark was my destiny.
It would change my life forever.
I would use its image to strike terror into the hearts of those who did evil.
I would ensure what happened to me would never happen to anyone else.
I would have my revenge.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm....
Twick or tweet!
Trick.
Remember the plan?
Seize and capture.
No killing.
That goes double for you.
If I was a superhero...
...where would I hide?
Spank me.
Intruder alert! lntruder alert!
Intruder alert! lntruder alert!
Shut up!
Now, that's impressive!
It's always risky introducing a tamed animal into the wild.
They may have trouble adapting to their new environment.
Somebody tell the fat lady...
...she's on in five.
"Joygasm! "
Get the girl!
Don't kill him.
If you kill him...
...he won't learn nothing.
Master Bruce!
How are you, young man?
You haven't called me that for a long time.
Old habits die hard.
Are you all right?
Where's Chase?
I'm afraid they've taken her.
Master Dick has run away.
The cave has been destroyed.
And there's another riddle.
I'm coming, my sweet.
Like the jacket?
It keeps me safe when I'm...
...jogging at night.
Batman will come for me.
Batman?
Batman, you say?
Coming for you?
I'm...
...counting on it.
What is that? Where's it coming from?
There!
Who's doing that?
The Riddler!
"We're five little items of an everyday sort.
"You'll find us all in a tennis court."
In....
A-E-l-O-U.
Vowels.
Not entirely unclever, sir.
But what do a clock, a match, chess pawns...
...and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?
Every riddle contains a number and they arrived in this order:
...and 5.
13, 1, 8 and 5.
Meaning?
Letters of the alphabet?
Of course, 13 is M.
1 would be A, 8 would be H and 5 would be E.
M-A-H-E.
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.
18 is R.
M-R-E.
How about...
..."Mr. E"?
-Mystery?
-Another name for mystery?
Enigma.
Mr. E. Nygma.
Edward Nygma.
Stickley's suicide was obviously a computer-generated forgery.
You really are quite bright, despite what people say.
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications. But it's not tested.
Tonight's a good night.
What do you suggest? By sea...
...or by air?
Why not both?
Who's your tailor?
I took the liberty, sir.
"R?"
What's that stand for?
Robin.
Riddler and Two-Face can make a pretty lethal combination.
You could use a hand.
Two against two are better odds.
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.
"A man's got to go his own way."
A friend taught me that.
Not just a friend.
A partner.
He's not coming.
Shut it down.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Hey, go!
A-14.
Hit!
Sweet!
B-12.
Hit!
My favorite vitamin.
That sinking feeling.
I like this game.
C-9.
You sunk my battleship!
Who, me?
This is your captain speaking.
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.
I got him!
I hope they can find the little black box.
Now...
...the real game begins.
Holy rusted metal, Batman!
The ground, it's all metal.
It's full of holes: holey.
Wait!
The whole island's moving!
Looking for us?
That was for my mother!
My father!
My brother!
And this is for me!
Finally, justice is served!
Let us die!
You're a man after our own heart, son!
I'll see you in hell!
I'd rather see you in jail!
Oh, good boy. Good boy.
The Bat's taught you well.
Noble.
Stupid...
...but noble.
Riddle me this.
Riddle me that.
Who's afraid of the big black bat?
No more tricks, Edward.
Very well, then.
Let's get real.
Release Chase. This is between you and me.
And me...
...and me!
You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and now you've devised a way to read minds.
You betcha!
Soon my little Box will be on countless TV's around the world...
...feeding me credit-card numbers...
...bank codes...
...sexual fantasies...
...and little white lies.
Into my head they'll go.
Victory is inevitable.
For if knowledge is power...
...then a god...
...am...
...l!
Was that over the top? I can never tell.
By the way, I've seen your mind. Freak!
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman ever truly coexist?
We'll find out today!
But first, let's meet our contestants.
Behind curtain...
...number one...
...the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian!
She enjoys hiking, manicures...
...and foolishly hopes to be the love of Bruce's life.
Behind curtain number two...
..."Fatman's" one and only partner.
This acrobat turned orphan...
...likes Saturday-morning cartoons and dreams of one day being...
...bare-naked with a girl.
And below these contestants...
...my personal favorite:
A watery grave.
Just one little touch...
...and five seconds later these two players are...
...gull feed on the rocks below.
Not enough time to save them both.
Which one will it be, Batman?
Bruce's love?
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?
There is no way for me to save them or myself.
It's all one giant death-trap.
Judges?
I'm sorry. Your answer must be in the form of a question.
But thank you for playing.
Wait!
I have a riddle for you.
For me?
Really?
Tell me.
I see without seeing.
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.
What am l?
Please!
You're as blind as a bat!
Exactly.
Bummer!
Thanks.
All those heroics for nothing.
No more riddles, no more curtains one and two.
Just plain curtains!
Aren't you forgetting something?
Your coin.
You're always of two minds.
Yes, of course. You're right.
Emotion's always the enemy of true justice.
You've always been a good friend.
Why?
Why can't I...
...kill you?
Too many questions.
Too many questions.
Poor Edward.
I had to save them both.
You see, I'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
Not because I have to be.
Now...
...because I choose to be.
Thank you for responding to my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.
Edward Nygma...
...has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity...
...of Batman.
Edward?
Who...
...is it?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.
Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me...
...you know who Batman is.
I can't tell you if you don't say, "please."
Edward, please.
Who is Batman?
I'm...
...Batman.
Your secret is safe.
He is definitely a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
Listen...
...I won't need this anymore.
Thank you for giving me a new dream.
Don't work too late.
Everyone is born.
But not everyone is born the same.
Some will grow to be butchers,
or bakers or candlestick makers.
Some will only be good
at making Jell-O salad.
But every human being is unique,
for better or forworse.
Most parents think their children
are the most beautiful things alive.
- Others are less emotional.
-What a waste of time.
- $9.25 for a bar of soap!
- I had to take a shower.
$5,000! I'm not paying it!
They can't repossess the kid!
- There's no way out.
- Make a U-turn.
Harry!
Harry and Zinnia Wormwood
lived in a very nice neighbourhood.
But they were not nice people.
Get out of the street, you dodos!
The Wormwoods were so busy,
they forgot they had a daughter.
lf they had paid her any attention,
they'd have seen she was special.
Oh, my gosh! MatiIda!
Now Iook what you did!
You're supposed to eat the spinach!
Babies ...
You're better off raising tomatoes!
At two, Matilda had already
learned how to take care of herself.
As time went by,
she developed a sense of style.
Every morning,
Matilda's brotherwent to school.
Her fatherwent to work.
selling used cars for unfair prices.
- Her mother took off to play Bingo.
- Soup's on the stove ...
Matilda was left alone.
That was how she liked it
At four. she had read
every magazine in the house.
One night she asked her father for
something she desperately wanted.
-A book? Why do you want a book?
- To read.
Why wouId you want to read, when the teIevision is right there?
- You get more out of watching TV.
- Get out of the way.
Matilda already knew
she was different from her family.
She saw that whatever she needed.
she'd have to get herself.
There's fish fingers in the microwave.
There's fish fingers in the microwave.
The next morning,
Matilda set off in search of a book.
-Where are the chiIdren's books?
- In that room.
-WouId you Iike me to pick out one?
- No, thank you. I can manage.
From then on, every day,
Matilda walked to the library.
She devoured one book after another.
When she finished all the children's
books. she searched for others.
Mrs. Phelps, who had been
watching herwith fascination, -
- offered Matilda some information.
You can have your own Iibrary card, and take books home.
- You can take as many as you Iike.
- That wouId be wonderfuI.
Matilda's strong mind continued
to grow, nurtured by the authors -
- who had sent their books out into
the world, like ships onto the sea.
The books gave Matilda a comforting
message: You are not alone.
Did any packages come today?.
-Where did aII this come from?
- The Iibrary.
- The Iibrary?. You're onIy four!
Then you'd be in schooI aIready.
I was supposed to start schooI in September. You wouIdn't Iisten.
Get up.
Give me that book!
- How oId is MatiIda?
- Four.
- I'm 6.. I was six in August.
- You're a Iiar.
- I want to go to schooI.
-Who'd sign for the packages?
We can't Ieave vaIuabIe packages on the doorstep. Go watch TV.
- There's something wrong with her.
- TeII me about it.
Hey, dipface! Have a marshmaIIow.
Have another!
Dipface!
Matilda longed for a friend,
like the kind people in her books.
lt occurred to her that
talking dragons and princesses -
- might exist only in story books.
But she was about to discover she
had a strength she didn't know of.
But she was about to discover she
had a strength she didn't know of.
I'm great! I'm incredibIe!
MichaeI, penciI and paper.
- Did we seII some cars today?.
- Did we!
- Can I get that new TV?
- Yeah!
It's time you Iearned the famiIy business. Write this down.
The first car I sold cost $320.
I soId it for $1.158.
The second one cost $512.
I soId it for $2.269!
- You're going too fast.
- Just write. The third cost $68.
I soId it for $999.
The fourth cost $1.100.
I soId it for
7,839 big American boffos!
-What was my profit for the day?.
Check it if you don't beIieve me.
- You saw the paper.
- From aII the way over here?
Are you being smart with me?
- If you are, you'II be punished.
- Punished for being smart?
When a person is bad, that person has to be taught a Iesson.
- Person?
- Get up!
Harry had unintentionally given
his daughter some practical advice.
He meant to say, ''child''.
lnstead, he said, ''person''.
Thereby, he introduced the idea that
children could punish their parents.
Only when they deserved it
of course.
MichaeI, come into my room!
-What?
- I'II take you to work today, okay?.
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I think appearance is important.
PeopIe don't buy a car. They buy me.
So I take pride in my appearance.
WeII-oiIed hair. cIean shave ...
Get ready for a big day of Iearning.
There's a sucker born every minute.
We'II take them for aII they've got.

- Here we are, my heartstrings ...
SnickerdoodIe. what did you do to your hair?.
My hair?.

Dirty dealings, like buying

Especially when the FBl
gets involved.

- I've got 9:18.
9:17 is correct.
- One day, aII this wiII be yours.

She's got 120,000 miIes on her.
Transmission's shot. bumpers are faIIing off ...
What do I do with her?.
I seII her!
We shouId weId these bumpers on, but that takes time and money.
So we use Super Super Glue instead.
- Go ahead. Put it on there.
-Won't it faII off?
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Not to me. Okay?. Transmission!
The sawdust Iets the engine run sweet as a nut. for a few miIes.
- Daddy, that's cheating.
- Nobody ever got rich being honest.
20 years ago, we couId turn the numbers back by hand.
But the Feds Iike to test the ingenuity of American businessmen.
Two-directionaI driII. If you run it backwards, the numbers go down.
CooI!
- Daddy, you're a crook.
-What?
- This is iIIegaI.
- Here, keep driIIing.
- Do you make money?.
- Don't peopIe need good cars?
Can't you seII good cars?
I'm smart, you're dumb.
I'm right, you're wrong!
There's nothing you can do about it.
Harry, I won!
I hit the doubIe bingo!
I'm taking you aII to Cafe Le Ritz!
Let me see the money!
Your hair Iooks awfuI!
I hope they'II Iet you in.
- Here's your hat, Daddy.
- Get in the car.
- How much?
- It's for me to know.
- You never take us out.
- I took you to The FIipper.
- There was a comb in the soup.
- Oh, yeah! I Iike thatjoint.
- This way, pIease.
- Harry, take your hat off.
- I can't.
- You can't wear a hat inside.
- I can't take it off.
- Nobody cares about your hair.
I can't get it off.
I'm gonna get this hat off.
I think your head sweIIed up.
- You're puIling the skin!
- You're such a baby!
- The fibres are fused to the head!
-What's that supposed to mean?
I wiII not be a figure of ridicuIe!
I want respect!
I stiII don't see how you gIued your hat on, Harry.
I did not glue my hat to my head!
The fibres fused to my hair!
Baby, wait a minute!
I'm getting it now.
Oh, my God!
From now on, this famiIy does exactIy what I say, when I say it!
Here's your hat.
Right now, we are eating dinner and watching TV.
Are you ready to get sticky
with Mickey?.
Are you ready to get sticky
with Mickey?.
Shut your Iight off.
For those idiots who don't know
how to play, here's how it goes.
For each correct answer, you'll move
one step closer to our cube of cash!
Any money that sticks to your
gooey body, you get to take home!
- Hi. Dad.
-Are you in this famiIy?.
HeIIo. Are you in this family?.
What is this trash you're reading?
It's IoveIy. It's ''Moby Dick'', by Herman MeIviIIe.
Moby what?
This is fiIth!
- It's a Iibrary book!
- I'm fed up with aII this reading!
You're a Wormwood! Act like one!
Sit up and Iook at the TV!
Get real sticky
and get cash for free.
Let's get sticky!
- I didn't do it.
- Of course not, you IittIe twit!
- I toId you that was a cheap set.
- It's not cheap, it's stoIen.
Put your Iight on!
Was it magic, or coincidence?
We only use
a tiny portion of our brains.
The events of the following day
made Matilda discover her strength.
- I need a car. Can you service me?
- Yes. WeIcome to Wormwood Motors.
- Harry Wormwood, owner and founder.
-Agatha TrunchbuII, PrincipaI.
I want a tight car, because I run a tight ship.
My schooI is a modeI of discipIine.
''Use the rod. beat the chiId.''
Do you have brats?
-A boy, Mikey, and one mistake.
- They're aII mistakes, chiIdren.
- I'm gIad I never was one.
- I'm gonna make you a great deaI.
You had better.
Thank you. Enjoy it.
Thank you. Enjoy it.
Hey, you.
You're going to schooI.
You'II get a reaI education at this pIace.
Matilda had always wanted
to go to school.
She tried to imagine
what her new school would be like.
She pictured a lovely building,
surrounded by trees and flowers.
There was a building. And children!
Regardless of how the school looked,
she was happy to be there.
After all, any school is better
than no school at all. lsn't it?.
You ... detention.
You're too smaII. Grow up quicker!
Heads up! ShouIders back!
- Sorry.
- It's better than being out there.
- ls that my teacher?.
- No, that's the principaI.
The principaI Iikes to snap a whip in here to see who's hiding.
- I'm MatiIda.
- Lavender.
- I'm Hortensia.
- Does she reaIIy hit chiIdren?
No. What she does is worse.
Like yesterday, in the second grade.
She makes weekIy visits to show the teachers how to handIe kids.
- JuIius ate two M&Ms.
-And she caught him?
- JuIius ate two M&Ms.
-And she caught him?
Of course!
-Was JuIius okay?.
- He Iived, if that's what you mean.
She used to be in the OIympics.
Shot-put, javeIin, hammer throw.
So she does this aII the time?
- It's better than the Chokey.
- Chokey?.
It's a taII hoIe in the waII. a drippy pipe with jagged edges.
The waIIs have naiIs sticking out.
Get in, you festering bowI of pus!
I've been in there twice.
- Didn't you teII your parents?
-WouId your parents beIieve it?
You must obey Miss TrunchbuII.
No. Here she comes!
Ah! Fresh meat!
-Amanda Thripp.
- Yes. Miss TrunchbuII.
What are those ... hanging down by your ears?
- You mean my pigtaiIs?
-Are you a pig?
- No. Miss TrunchbuII.
- Do I aIIow pigs in my schooI?
- My mommy thinks they're sweet.
- Your mommy is a twit!
- Chop them off by tomorrow, or ...
- But ...
But?
Did you say ''but''?
- Hammer throw.
- DefiniteIy.
I'II give you ''but''.
- Good Ioft!
- ExceIIent reIease!
Think she'II make the fence?
Get to cIass before I throw you aII in the Chokey.
- Lavender, what's my teacher Iike?
- Run. run. run!
Faster! Get in!
Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey,
was one of those people -
- who appreciates every child
forwho she or he is.
- I scooped these up for you.
- How IoveIy. Thank you, Amanda.
We have a new student with us today.
This is MatiIda Wormwood.
I'd Iike you to sit with Lavender.
You aII know how scary the first day of schooI is. so be nice to MatiIda.
CouId you get her workbook, please?
You can sit down.
Miss Honey was a wonderful teacher.
But her life was not as beautiful
as it seemed. She had a dark secret
Though it caused her pain, it didn't
interfere with her teaching.
You've come on a good day. We're going to review what we've Iearned.
If you know an answer, just raise your hand.
We've been working on our times tabIes. Who'd Iike to demonstrate?
Let's do some together.
- 2 x 4 is?
- 2 x 6 is?
- 2 x 9 is?
Soon you'II be abIe to do them aII, whether it's 2 x 7 ...
- Or 13 x 379.
- I beg your pardon?
- I think that's the answer.
13 x 379 is 4.927.
- It is.
-Wow ...
- You can muItipIy big numbers?
- I read a book on mathematics.
- You Iike to read?
- Yes. I Iove to read.
-What do you Iike to read?
- I've been reading DarIs Chickens.
CharIes Dickens.
I couId read him every day.
So couId I.
AII right, take out your workbooks and Iet's start with section three.
I'II be back in a moment.
Gotcha! Right in the neck.
Come in.
AImost got you.
Good to see you, Jen.
Time for one of our
IittIe heart-to-hearts?
It's about the new girI in my cIass,
MatiIda Wormwood.
Her father says she's a reaI wart.
A carbuncIe. A bIister.
A pustuIe of maIignant ooze.
- MatiIda is sweet and very bright.
-A bright chiId?
- She can muItipIy Iarge sums.
- So can a caIcuIator.
I think she might be happier in an oIder and more advanced cIass.
You can't handIe the IittIe viper, so you're trying to get rid of her.
- No ...
- TypicaI, sIothfuI cowardice!
The distance the shot-put goes depends on your effort.
If you can't handIe the littIe brat,
I'Il Iock her in the Chokey!
- Get it?
- Yes. ma'am.
Everything I do is for your own good.
And the good of those putrescent, IittIe children!
- Mom. I'm home.
- How was school?
- I get to do sixth grade work.
- HoId on a minute.
- Can't you see I'm on the phone?
- You just asked me how schooI was.
- The baby wasn't his.
-WeII, it was reaIIy great.
- No way. They have to be impIants.
- The principaI is insane.
- She threw a girI over the fence.
- You shouId wax yours, too.
I have the most wonderfuI teacher.
Mine are driving me crazy.
Six hours at schooI is not enough.
I'II say.
Awhack to the beIIy.
A smack to the face. Burns is hurt.
Saved by the belI.
- Packages at this hour?.
- Come here.
- HeIIo.
-We don't give money, charity ...
I'm Jennifer Honey.
I'm MatiIda's teacher.
What's she done now?.
You! Go to your room, right now!
- She's your probIem now.
- There is no probIem.
Then beat it. We're watching TV.
If a TV show is more important than
MatiIda, you shouIdn't be a parent.
Turn it off and Iisten to me.
Come on in. Get this over with.
Mrs. Wormwood won't Iike this.
- CIose the door.
-Who is it?
Some teacher.
-What did you do that for?.
-What do you want?
- MatiIda has a brilliant mind.
- Yeah, right. Give me a beer.
- Her math skiIIs are extraordinary.
- Do you want one?
No thank you. She's reading materiaI that I didn't see untiI coIIege.
CoIIege!
With private instruction, she'd be ready for coIIege in a few years.
A girI does not get anywhere by acting inteIIigent.
Look at you and me.
You chose books. I chose Iooks.
I have a nice house and a husband.
You teach chiIdren their ABC's.
You want MatiIda to go to coIIege?
I didn't go to coIIege.
I don't know anybody who did.
A bunch of hippies and cesspooI saIesmen.
Don't sneer at educated peopIe.
If you became iII, your doctor wouId be a coIIege graduate.
If you were sued, your Iawyer wouId have gone to coIIege, too.
Sued by who?
Who have you been taIking to?
Nobody.
I can see we're not going to agree. Are we?
I'm sorry
I burst in on you Iike this.
We ought to sue her for interrupting our show.
-Why's he standing in the middIe?
- Because it's over.
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.
-Who won?
- I don't know. You shut it off.
The entire school will go
to the assembly room immediately!
The entire school will go
to the assembly room immediately!
Sit!
-What's up?
- Beats me.
Bruce Bogtrotter.
WouId IittIe Brucey come up here?
He Iives on my bIock.
This boy, Bruce Bogtrotter, is a vicious sneak thief.
- You're a disgusting criminaI.
-What are you taIking about?
ChocoIate cake.
You sIithered Iike a serpent into the kitchen and ate my snack!
Do you deny it?
Confess!
- I can't remember a specific cake.
- This one was mine.
- It was the best cake in the worId.
- My mom's is better.
How can you be sure unIess you have another piece?
Sit down, Bog.
Here we go.
SmelIs chocoIatey, eh?
Now. eat it!
I don't want any. Thank you.
Eat it!
Don't eat it.
- She wouIdn't give him cake.
- It's poison.
- You Iook Iike you enjoyed that.
- Yes. ma'am.
- You must have some more.
- No thanks.
But you'II hurt the cook's feeIings.
She made this cakejust for you.
Her sweat and bIood went into this cake.
You wiII not Ieave this pIatform untiI you have eaten the whoIe cake!
- The whoIe cake! See you at Iunch.
- Thank you, Cookie.
You wanted cake, you got cake.
Now eat it!
Poor Brucey.
He's going to puke.
- I can't Iook. Is he going to puke?
-Without a doubt.
- Bruce Iooks reaI bad.
- Give up?
You can do it, Brucey!
Yeah, you can do it!
Go. Bruce!
SiIence!
SiIence!
Stop! SiIence!
The entire assembIy wiII stay five hours after school!
Any chiIdren who object wiII go straight into the Chokey. Together!
Code R's the official way of saying
we've caught a bad one.
-Where were you?
- Miss TrunchbuII kept us Iate.
That's a Iie! The packages were Ieft outside because you weren't here.
You get aII this stuff from cataIogues and I don't get anything!
It's car parts. It's business.
-Why isn't it sent to the office?
- The cops are watching the office.
The cops are watching the house.
- They're parked outside, right now.
- Those are speedboat saIesmen.
- ReaIIy nice guys.
- Cops.
Speedboats?
There are no Iakes around here.
- Some peopIe go away on weekends.
-And some peopIe are cops.
They're not cops!
Go to bed, you Iying IittIe earwig!
With the FBl watching her father,
and the Trunchbull at school. -
- it was a rare moment when Matilda
couldjust play.
Afrog! Afrog! Afrog!
-What is it. Lavender?.
-Afrog!
- It's a saIamander.
- It's a chameIeon.
''Any of the semiaquatic saIamanders from the genus triturus.''
''Some are brightIy coIoured and secrete irritating substances.''
UseIess, fIaming car!
Wormwood! SeII me a Iemon!
You're heading for the Chokey!
Teach you a Iesson!
You and your father think you can make a fooI out of me!
- I'm nothing Iike my father!
- You're the spitting image!
The appIe never rots far from the tree!
- Miss Honey!
- TrunchbuII is teaching our cIass.
She'II be here any second!
Make sure the water is coId.
Cover the fish!
Put away the art projects.
Most great ideas
come from careful planning.
But sometimes.
theyjustjump out at you.
Last time, you forgot yourseIves.
Don't speak unIess you're spoken to.
- Don't Iaugh. Don't breathe IoudIy.
- Don't breathe at aII.
Good morning, Miss TrunchbuII.
Sit!
Shoo.
I don't understand why chiIdren are so disgusting.
They're Iike insects.
They shouId be got rid of.
The perfect schooI is one in which there are no children.
Do you agree, Miss Honey?.
You! Front of the cIass!
Are you okay?.
Next time I teII you to empty your pockets, do it faster!
This couId be the most interesting thing you've ever done.
Sit down, you squirming worm!
Get up!
- Can you speII?
-We can speII ''difficuIty''.
- You can't speII ''difficuIty''.
- She taught us with a poem.
How sweet. What poem is that?
Mrs. D. Mrs. I.
Mrs. F. F. I.
Mrs. C. Mrs. U.
Mrs. L. T. Y.
Why are aII these women married?
You teach speIIing, not poetry!
Why do smaII chiIdren take so Iong to grow up?
They do it deIiberateIy, just to annoy me.
What's funny?.
Spit it out! I Iike ajoke as weII as the next fat person.
It's a snake!
It's a snake!
One of you tried to poison me. Who?
MatiIda! I knew it.
- It's not a snake. It's a newt.
-What did you say?.
- It's a newt. Miss TrunchbuII.
- Stand up! You did this.
- No. Miss TrunchbuIl.
- Did you have accompIices?
- I didn't do it!
- You thought you'd pay me back?
-WeII, I'Il pay you back.
- For what. Miss TrunchbuII?
- For this newt, you pissworm!
- I'm teIIing you, I didn't do it!
Anyway, I'm big and you're smaII,
I'm right and you're wrong.
There's nothing you can do about it.
You're a Iiar and a scoundreI.
Your father is a cheat! You're the most corrupt Iow-Iifes in history!
Am I wrong? I'm never wrong.
In this cIassroom. in this schooI,
I am God!
- You!
- I didn't move!
- You did this.
- She was sitting way over here.
I'II be watching you.
Each and every one.
When you turn the corner, when you get your smeIIy coats.
When you skip merriIy to lunch.
I'II be watching you. AII of you.
And especiaIIy you!
- Thanks for not teIIing.
- Best friends don't teII.
She can reaIIy dance.
I'm gonna cIean up this mess.
I'II be out there in a minute.
- Miss Honey ...
- Yes. MatiIda?
- I did it.
- Did what?
- I made the glass tip over.
- Don't Iet her make you feeI bad.
- It was an accident.
- I did it with my eyes. Watch.
It's wonderfuI you feeI so powerfuI.
Many peopIe don't.
Come on. Tip over.
- Tip over.
- It's aII right, MatiIda.
- I reaIIy did do it, Miss Honey.
- Sometimes you can do things.
But when you want to show someone, then you can't.
- Or maybe something is broken ...
- This isn't Iike that.
I don't know.
Maybe I made myseIf tired.
-WouId you Iike to go to my house?
- I'd Iike that very much.
Good.
Good.
I just stare very hard and I can feeI the strongness.
I feeI I can move aImost anything.
- You do believe me. Don't you?
- You shouId beIieve in it.
BeIieve it with aII your heart.
That's where Miss TrunchbuII Iives.
-Why is there a swing?
-A girl used to Iive in that house.
Her Iife was good and happy.
When she was two. her mother died.
Her father was a doctor. He needed someone to Iook after things.
He asked the mother's stepsister to Iive with them.
But the girI's aunt was mean and treated her badIy.
- TrunchbuII?
- Yes.
- Then the girI's father died.
- How did her father die?
- The poIice said he kiIIed himseIf.
-Why wouId he do that?
No one knows.
The end is happier.
She found a smaII cottage.
She rented it for $50 a month and pIanted hundreds of wiId fIowers.
-And she moved out of the house.
- Good for her.
- Do you know why I toId you this?
- No.
Your famiIy doesn't appreciate you.
One day, things wiII be different.
- ShouId we have tea and cookies?
- Yes, pIease.
- It's the cottage from your story.
- Yes.
The young woman is you!
- Then ... No!
- Yes.
Aunt TrunchbuII.
When I Ieft Aunt TrunchbuII's home.
I Ieft aII my treasures behind.
- Treasures?
- Photos of my mother and father.
And a beautifuI doII my mother gave me. Lissy DoII, I caIIed her.
- MiIk?
- Yes, pIease.
Why don't you run away?.
I've thought about it, but I can't abandon my children.
-Without teaching I'd have nothing.
- You're very brave.
- Not as brave as you.
- I thought aduIts weren't afraid.
AII aduIts get scared, just Iike chiIdren.
I wonder what Miss TrunchbuII is afraid of.
I wonder what Miss TrunchbuII is afraid of.
There she is!
- Shot-put. Hammer throw.
- JaveIin.
Back. Back. Back.
- She's afraid of a cat?
- BIack cats. She's superstitious.
- Poor kitty.
- He's aII right.
- Let's go get your treasures.
- No!
She's gone. Come on!
Matilda!
Miss Honey!
Move, you piece ofjunkyard fodder!
Shift, you fiIthy ...
My house!
Oh, my!
- My father's portrait was there.
- The artist must have been brave.
ReaIly brave.
We shouId go ...
Father's chocoIate box.
After supper, he'd take a chocolate and cut it in haIf.
And he'd give me the bigger haIf.
When he died.
I couIdn't even sneak one.
She'd take a chocoIate and say:
Much too good for chiIdren!
Have one.
No. She'd notice.
-Where's Lissy DoII?
- Upstairs.
MatiIda ...
This is my room.
- That's my dad.
-What's his name?
Magnus. I caIIed him King Magnus.
And he caIIed me BumbIebee.
- I don't think he kiIIed himseIf.
- Neither do I.
Is that Lissy DoII?
Wormwood!
You useIess. used car saIesman scum!
Come here. now!
I know what ''caveat emptor'' means, but I'm gonna sue you!
I'Il burn down your shop! I'II shove thatjaIopy up your bazonga!
You're gonna Iook Iike roadkiII!
You what ..?
Come on.
- ShouIdn't we hide?
- Go out the kitchen door.
I'II distract her.
Who's in my house?
Come out and fight Iike a man!
TaIIy-ho!
Come on.
Over there.
Some rats are gonna die today.
Oh, my goodness.
FeeI my heart. Weren't you the most scared you've ever been?
She shouIdn't treat peopIe that way.
Somebody has to teach her a Iesson.
When she Ieaves, we'II get the doII.
-What?
- Just kidding.
Come here.
Promise me you'II never go back in that house again.
- I promise.
- Okay. Come on.
He came home with $2.000 cash and he threw it up in the air.
We swam in it like we were on
''The MiIIion DoIIar Sticky''!
- Do you Iike that show?.
- I Iove that show.
Now he has money in banks aII over.
But does he give me a dime?
- MatiIda. this is Bob and BiII.
- They're cops.
- They are Ace Power Boat saIesmen.
- Babyface, I'm starved!
- Hi, Harry.
-Who are you?
What is this? A hot tub party?.
- You're entertaining surfers?
- They're cops, Dad.
-Are you interested in time-share?
- Get out.
-Are you interested in time-share?
- Get out.
You don't Iet me taIk to peopIe!
I need to taIk to someone besides the kids.
A man is entitIed to come home and find dinner on the tabIe!
- Dad. YeII at me, okay?.
- Shut up and Ieave us aIone!
- YeII at me again!
- I'lI pound your miserabIe hide!
I want respect! You'II get a tanning you won't forget!
My word is Iaw!
No kid likes being yelled at
But Harry's ranting and raving -
- gave Matilda the key to her power.
To unlock that power,
all she had to do was practice.
Start acting like a Wormwood!
What are you? Stupid?
There's something wrong with her.
lf you're a Wormwood, it's time
you started acting like one!
That was one of my favorites,
played for all you pretty ones.
Playing music to make you smile ...
Playing music to make you smile ...
- Don't we need a search warrant?
- No. This guy's dirty.
We'II show this tape in court.
That box is fuII of stoIen parts.
How about Ietting me handIe that camera for a whiIe?
Do you know how to use it?
Do you know about the zoom?
- How to adjust the eye piece?
- I can handIe it.
It's my turn.
- Your turn to drop it.
- I won't drop it.
You'll be in a Iot of troubIe.
The femaIe minor.
- ShouIdn't you be in schooI?
- I hope you have a search warrant.
If you don't, you could Iose yourjob or even go to prison.
Your father is going to prison.
Do you know where you'II end up?
- In an orphanage.
-We can make it a nice one.
The kind with food ... and tiny cockroaches. What do you say?.
Your car is about to run a stop sign.
She bought some time for her dad.
But now. Matilda had
bigger fish to fry. Much bigger.
- Hey, dipface. Where are you going?
- Out.
Have a carrot.
Chew your food!
Chew your food!
Having power isn't as important
as what you do with it
And what Matilda had in mind
was nothing short of heroic.
Come on!
Lissy DoII, come on!
PIease come here.
Leave me aIone!
Magnus!
Miss Honey!
You'II never beIieve what I got you!
I aIso brought you this.
I ate mine Iast night.
I wiII be teaching your cIass today.
Miss Honey was getting nervous,
but Matilda had a plan.
- She is reaIIy raving mad.
-What did your father caII you?
- Hummingbird?
- BumbIebee.
- She knows the doII is missing.
-And he caIIed her TrunchbuII?
- He caIIed her Agatha.
- She caIIed him Magnus, right?
Maybe I couId put the doII back.
No. I can't do that.
CaIm down.
It's gonna be okay. I promise.
- You promised you wouIdn't go back.
- I was on the garage roof.
- I did it with my powers.
-AII right. I need to think.
Powers?
I think I got them down.
Watch this.
And no more Miss Nice Girl.
Get inside, quickIy! Run!
Get against that walI, quickIy!
Water!
And hoId the newt!
Join the ranks. Move!
I am here to teach you aII a Iesson.
Sometimes in Iife. horrible and unexpIainabIe things happen.
These things are a test of character.
And I have character.
Form a Iine across the room!
FiII this gap!
I expect you're wondering what I'm taIking about.
A chiId came to my house.
I don't know how, when or why.
- May I ..?
- No, you may not.
But I know a chiId came.
Did you know it was iIIegaI to enter someone's home without permission?
Yes. Miss TrunchbuII.
Stomach in! Shoulders back!
Do any of you recognise this?
Let's pIay a game.
Who was wearing a pretty, red ribbon yesterday -
- and isn't wearing one today?.
Who does this disgusting ribbon beIong to?
I shaII personaIIy see to it that the demented LiIIiputian -
-who owns this ribbon wiII never see the Iight of day again!
I was at your house Iast night.
I broke your arm once before.
I can do it again.
I'm not seven years oId anymore,
Aunt TrunchbuII.
Shut your hoIes!
You'II be put away in a pIace where no one wiII find you.
Look!
The chaIk!
''Agatha ...''
''This is Magnus.''
''Give my littIe BumbIebee ...
... her house and her money.''
''Then get out of town.
If you don't, I wiII get you.''
''I wiII get you Iike you got me.''
''That is a promise.''
PIease don't throw him.
Lavender!
It's the Trunch!
Look at this!
Let go.
- I didn't know I couId do that.
- Pretty good.
Trunchbull was gone,
never to be seen or heard from. -
- never to darken a doorway again.
- never to darken a doorway again.
Miss Honey moved back to her house,
and Matilda was a frequent visitor.
Did you know the heart of a mouse beats 650 times a minute?
-Where did you Iearn that?
- In a book.
It beats so fast. it sounds Iike it's humming.
Hey, you!
We're Ieaving. Let's go.
- Let's wrap these up.
- I'd be happy to waIk her home.
-We're moving to Guam.
- Guam?
- Daddy's out of business.
- I don't want to!
-We're taking a permanent vacation!
-We have to hurry to the airport.
I Iove it here!
PIease don't Iet them take me.
- Get in the car. MeIinda!
- MatiIda! I want to stay here!
Why wouId she want a disobedient kid?
She's wonderfuI and I Iove her.
-Adopt me, Miss Honey!
- I don't have time for this.
- I have the adoption papers.
-What?
-Where did you get those?
- From a book in the Iibrary.
Are you hearing this, Harry?.
- You just have to sign.
- I'II be an onIy chiId again!
I can't think with aII these sirens!
What do you think, pumpkin?
You're the onIy daughter I ever had.
And I never understood you.
Who's got a pen?
- Here.
- Thanks.
This was perhaps the first decent
thing they ever did for Matilda.
And here.
Come here. Turn around.
- You won't want support payments?
- No. We have everything we need.
Let's rolI.
So Harry and Zinnia got away.
And as bad as things were, -
- that's how good they became.
Miss Honey was made
principal of the school.
And Matilda found, to her surprise,
that life could be fun.
She decided to have
as much fun as possible.
After all, she was a very smart kid.
Matilda and Miss Honey each got
what they had always wanted:
A loving family.
And Matilda never had to use
her powers again.
Well. l mean almost never.
''CaII me IshmaeI.''
''Some years ago, never mind how Iong, preciseIy ...''
EngIish subtitIes - IFT
I don't wanna go camping, Mom.
Oh, come on. We go camping every year on Memorial Day.
It's Memorial Day, the start of another summer.
Like most people,
I look forward to it.
Except this year.
This year it's hard to look forward to anything.
- Hello. Hi, Frank.
- I got the notes from the I.R.S.
Tax inquiry.
You gotta be kidding me, Frank.
- I can't even get a break...
- What happened is simple, I guess.
I lost my business, and now I've gotta sell the house.
My wife says
I'm not looking at it right.
She says one day I'll look back and see it all happened for a reason.
Tom.
Are you coming or not?
Maybe I just can't see it.
Maybe I never will.
Stop!
- Who said you could wear my earrings?
- You said they look stupid on you.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Take them off right now!
- Girls, come on. Stop it.
- Don't touch me!
That's it! That's enough!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch my hair.
- Girls, are you all right?
- Yeah.
We're okay.
- Can you hear me?
- I'd hear you better for a quarter.
Don't start that now.
Quickly, in the car.
We're very late. Hurry.
We'll stop at home, and we're off.
Mommy, my stomach hurts.
Are you sure, sweetheart?
The doctor said there's nothing wrong.
- Faker, faker.
- I'm not, I'm not!
- Stop it!
- Look out!
Oh, my God.
What was that?
- Somebody call the police!
- Police?
Stay in the car.
Oh, my God.
Can you get up?
Can you move that leg?
I'm terribly sorry. It's all my fault.
I didn't even see you.
- There was a dog in the intersection.
- Betty Jane!
- She ran off that way. She looked okay.
- Thanks.
What's going on here?
I'm the driver. It's my fault.
I was coming to the intersection...
- Excuse me.
- I swerved.
Hitchhiking is against the law in this township.
- So is running into a car.
- That's not what happened.
Lady, why don't you and your son just walk back to the car?
I haven't given you my name.
You're all done here.
Thank you.
All right, people, let's get movin'.
What are we staring at?
This is not a circus.
Let's move on. Move it out.
The man's hurt.
Come on. Show is over.
Let's go, people. Move it out.
Move it out. Let's go.
What are you staring at?
Let's move it along.
- Do we have to do this now?
- It's what Memorial Day means.
Mommy, which one's our daddy?
- You know. She told you last year.
- I forget.
It's all right.
Daddy doesn't actually have a place here, honey... because he died very far away... in Korea.
At least they could've tried to find his plane.
Tom, they did try.
Hocus-pocus diddly-ocus.
Slow down, boys.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
- What are you drinkin'?
- What's everybody else having?
- G&T's.
- G&T's it is then.
What's a G&T?
- Gin and tonic.
- Of course. Perfect.
Where is your sister?
Aren't you worried about her?
I am worried. She's never this late.
I'm gonna go find her.
- Joyce, your sister's always late.
- Can you watch Cindy for me?
Tom, take that, please.
Very funny.
- Did you put celery in it again?
- Please, sweetheart.
Up you go.
Walk, Thomas! Walk, please.
- Why isn't this on?
- You didn't check inside.
Gunny, snakes can't fit into a space this small.
A little baby one could.
Look inside.
- It blasted off on my nose.
- It did?
- How's your tummy?
- Good.
Jeanne, where have you been?
You're never gonna...
I can't. I'm still shaking.
Don't touch that. It's poison.
- Hey, Gunny. See that lake?
- Yeah.
- Know what's in it?
- Fishies.
Monsters.
You know what else?
That's where Mom's gonna make you take swimming lessons.
I won't. I'm not. I won't.
Wait here.
- Let this be a warning.
- I don't know how badly he was hurt.
Security is what you should be thinking about, not starting some silly business.
- You have one, two clients?
- Three.
- Three. I was being all worried.
- I should call the hospital.
With three clients and pension money, you'll be able to... I don't know...
What expression would you use?
Scrape by?
It takes time to start a business.
Listen to me.
Hank hasn't replaced you yet.
There's nothing wrong with being his bookkeeper.
Jeanne, those shorts!
I wouldn't have the nerve.
That's the difference between you and me, Shirley.
I would if I had your legs,
Jeanne.
You picked the perfect day to wear them.
You never know who's around the corner.
Phil?
Look at you.
Hello. Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe it.
- Mommy.
- What?
This is my youngest.
This is Gunther.
- We call him Gunny.
- How are you?
You're tall.
You can be tall too.
- Okay. All right.
- He's deathly afraid of heights.
He's afraid of everything.
Monsters and snakes and swimming pools.
Cindy, that's enough.
Let's all go play.
I don't even remember.
When did we last see each other?
- What are you doing here?
- Must be fate.
To think I nearly gave this territory to one of my salesmen.
I tell you what. You tell me when you're free for dinner.
Listen on up.
Everybody feeling good and limber?
How 'bout a ball game?
Okay, fathers and sons, like we did last year.
Jim, raise the bat. We're gonna see who's gonna be the home team.
Fathers win!
You guys can bat first, okay?
Don't look at us.
We wanna win.
I'm never gonna be "it" again!
You be "it"!
Give him a cookie. One more cookie, then I want you to brush your teeth.
- I hate you!
- Hey, last warning!
Tom Holman, you stop this right now!
Come on, fellas, please.
It's been a very long day.
Tom, give him the doll.
Give him Davy.
Am I talking to myself?
No, no!
- This is not a toy.
- But Dad gave it to me.
Give him Davy.
Give it to him.
Then give me Davy and go take out the garbage.
He gets whatever he wants, and I get stuck with the garbage.
I know you.
You're Betty Jane.
You're lost?
Come here.
You have to pull both sides of the string... when you tighten this or we're gonna lose it again.
Good morning.
Oh, my God! Tom!
What is that?
I don't know why we can't keep her.
You're the one who almost ran her over.
What's a pound?
A place where they tie dogs together by their tails.
Her tail's not long enough.
It's not fair.
I never get what other kids have.
He wants a dad.
I know.
Mom, I think she has to go.
Betty Jane!
Where have you been, you silly girl?
I don't understand you.
I found her near my house.
She was lost.
I'm grateful to you.
Your name is Tom?
Is that right?
I'm so...
Your leg.
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry about yesterday.
Really. I'm...
I'm Jeanne Holman.
And... if... if there is anything I can do to compensate... for my carelessness, please just say.
We could use a ride.
Bye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
It's dangerous to stand by the road, isn't it, Mommy?
Yes, it is, honey.
What if he doesn't get a ride?
Damnation!
You boys wait here.
Excuse me!
- Sorry. I don't know your name.
- Jack.
Jack, this is very dangerous.
I'll be careful.
Would you come back to the car?
Why?
You've gotta have a place to stay until that leg heals.
Dogs should stay outside.
Honey, he's a lovely dog.
I want to make a few things clear and...
I would never do this under any circumstances... except these circumstances.
And because of that cast.
So, there is no point standing here.
You've got baseball. Take Gunny down the street to his friend's.
- I'd appreciate that.
- Come on, Gunny.
I'll take you to your room.
You can stay in Tom's room, and he'll bunk in with Gunny.
One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight... nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come.
I got ya.
Now America's favorite family comedy,
The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.
- It's starting.
- Come on. Just one more.
Eat your corn, eat your corn
Tickle, tickle, tickle
Eat your corn, eat your corn
I'm a corn dog
- Are you a chicken?
- You bet I am.
I'm gonna go for a walk.
Sure.
Michael, listen to me when I say come in.
Dinner is ready.
- Okay, let's go.
- You got the keys?
- Good night.
- Hey!
- You lookin' for somethin'?
- The highway.
It's a couple miles that way.
We can take you if you want.
No, thanks.
Always tell Mommy where you're going.
Yes, sir.
Honey?
Hi, I'll just be one...
He's outside.
He's making sun tea.
Sun tea?
Then it's moon toast and star jam?
And the next thing you know, it's a heavenly breakfast?
Hank, go outside.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Coffee?
Is it sun coffee?
How can you ask me that?
Who is he?
Where did he come from?
Does he have any identification?
Don't you realize he could be dangerous?
- You don't know a thing about him.
- I do know.
He is not of this world.
Are you saying he's from someplace else, like outer space?
- I'm pretty sure. I can't...
- How do you know?
Scout's honor, Joyce.
He can fly.
And he has a third eye right in the middle of his forehead.
- Green, just like the other two.
- You're makin' that up.
- You act like this thing is a joke.
- Joyce.
Well?
It's good tea.
Hi, Brian.
- Good work.
- Thanks.
I'll clean up.
Here we go.
See you Saturday.
- Get some rest.
- Bye, Coach.
As I was saying, brakes were screeching, then it crashed.
People came running, but I got there first.
You should've seen.
Bones were sticking out.
There was blood everywhere.
He wouldn't even get on the stretcher.
He walked to the ambulance.
This guy, if he's for real...
- Could we meet him sometime?
- Maybe.
- Bye.
- Bye, Tom.
I saw your club last night.
What was in the box?
How'd you see?
What are you, a Russki spy?
No, he's a Peeping Tom.
You get it? Tom.
- Can I join?
- Very doubtful, Holman.
Tell us why we'd want a bellyache in our club.
- Come on, guys. Let's go.
- You wanna meet Jack, don't you?
Holman, this better be good.
- What is this, Holman?
- Yeah, what are you trying to do?
- What the hell is going on here?
- Boys, inside.
What the hell do you think you are doing here?
Sunbathing.
You know, I know how guys like you operate.
Jeanne never actually invited you here, did she?
No, you're right.
She didn't invite me.
She insisted.
Yeah, sure.
Honey!
Enjoy.
But what does it get you?
You. That is what I care about.
I'm only gonna say this one more time.
Bringing a perfect stranger into your home isn't like you.
Let me show you something.
It's the last thing I expected.
Where did this come from?
All these years I've been away, building up the business...
I carried it around with me.
Why?
Maybe you were the one
I was doing it all for.
Dirty freight cars.
Gettin' caught in the rain, nobody to talk to.
The whole world does come to you.
Every place that you ever wanted to see... and a few that you cannot even imagine.
Like the salt flats in Utah.
What are the salt flats?
The flattest place on Earth, a place that's cracked like the moon... where nothing grows except... quiet.
And it's a quiet that, like, moves through you... like a wind.
It scares you at first.
It's a place so bright... where the dark becomes light... and clouds, like shadows, dancing in your eyes.
Is that where you go home?
Yeah.
But most people, they live in houses like this one... and I guess they like it.
I have a different kind of house... where there are no walls.
- Just mountains and trees and oceans.
- Wow.
Don't you ever get cold or hungry?
Sometimes, but I just eat snakes or lizards.
I'm just kidding.
But there's always a way to make do.
If you don't have much, you don't need much.
And we were just going to bed.
Yeah.
Yeah, I bet you were.
- Good night.
- Night.
Step in and swing straight.
Eye on the ball. Come on.
It's nothin' to smile at, Sackin.
Holman!
Don't disappoint me now.
Come on, Holman.
What are you lookin' at?
Don't tell me the ball.
I was.
Never complain, never explain.
Come on. Everybody in.
I wanna talk to you.
Come on, come on!
What do I have to say to you guys?
Huh? Look at you!
Bottom of the league three years running.
I mean, come on! What am I saying?
I'm not talking here to myself.
The only thing that's gonna save you is determination. You with me?
Determination!
You wanna win,
I wanna see it on your faces.
I wanna see you bustin' up for it, bustin' up!
Get out in the field.
I'm gonna hit some to you.
And will somebody catch some of these?
Way to go, Holman.
Now Coach is really mad.
- So I'm having a bad day.
- When are you gonna have a good one?
Yeah, why don't you just take your clothes off and play naked?
- That was no big deal.
- Maybe you don't think so, pervert.
- Your mother should know.
- Shut up!
You pansy!
Mine!
Come on, Betty Jane.
Off you go.
- Hi, Mom! We're home.
- Hi!
- How was the birthday party?
- I have a stomachache.
Stomachache? Not again.
How long does Jack have to be here?
- Until his leg heals.
- How long is that?
About a month, I suppose.
Why?
I was just wondering.
- Does he have to stay with us?
- I thought you liked him.
- Well, I do, but...
- We invited him, Tom.
I don't know. Can we pay him to go somewhere else?
Excuse me.
Talk to her, Phil.
Tell her to come back to work for me.
Besides, we need her for the Wednesday night league.
No can do.
I am behind my gal 100%.
Your gal?
Business is a good idea, assuming you're adequately capitalized.
- She has a bank appointment next week.
- With no credit history?
Banks are not the end of the line.
There's always investors.
- You should try to sleep in tomorrow.
- Maybe.
That was fun, really.
If you call losing fun.
I think I'm the guilty one there.
- Wait a minute. Don't you ever lose?
- Only at bowling.
Thank you.
Or bowling with me, at any rate.
- I tried.
- No, you were great.
You're very generous.
I appreciate what you said to Hank.
He worries about me.
What I said about investors... they have benefits... especially if that investor is me.
- Are you serious?
- I am betting.
I'm betting that you're gonna succeed.
There's nothin' wrong with bettin' on you.
Is there?
Well.
I had a great time.
Thank you.
- I'll say good night now.
- Okay.
Good night.
- I'm sorry. I'm just going in.
- No, no.
Thanks for watching the boys.
Sure.
About what Tom said today.
It's just what his friends have been saying.
I don't mind.
Well, I do.
I bet things are nice out there.
A hundred million miles between neighbors.
If I could just reach out... and get some answers.
- Answers to what?
- Everything.
Silly things, mostly.
Can the car possibly last another year?
Should Gunny take swimming lessons?
Am I making a mistake... starting a business?
Why would that be a mistake?
I suppose other people might say that a woman... in my position... shouldn't take such a chance.
Did you ever think that maybe it's other people... that are the problem?
Yeah.
What is really worrying you?
The boys.
I just think that maybe I oughta... start thinking about getting remarried or something... for their sake.
I don't know how I'm gonna take care of them if I don't.
You are taking care of them.
I don't know.
I don't know, Jack.
I just feel so lost sometimes.
So you know... when Columbus first set out... needless to say, he didn't have very much to go by.
He didn't know what he was doing and he wasn't looking for a new world.
Just a faster way to India.
But that's the way it is with explorers.
Sometimes they feel lost.
Are you saying that's what I am then?
I'm an explorer.
That's nice.
You should see me navigate a parking space.
Do you ever feel lost?
Well, I'll go check on the boys.
Good night.
Gunny, stand over there and field.
Run!
Looks to me like you could use a pitcher.
- Yeah.
- Want me to toss a few?
Give me the bucket.
Okay.
Here comes my crutch ball.
Nice side arm.
Are you a pitcher?
I've thrown a few.
Okay.
Take anything that looks good.
Come on, Holman, concentrate.
Can I say something?
You know, baseball is a thing that if you push too hard... you get exactly the opposite of what you're trying for.
This time, swing to miss.
- Are you kidding?
- Clean strike.
Okay. That's easy.
Wow! I didn't even mean to.
Can you do that again?
Brian, Bobby M., on the bench.
Come on. Hustle.
All right, everybody, listen up.
One thing I wanna say to you.
Don't let up.
Understand?
Huh?
All right, go sit in the bleachers.
All right, guys, listen up.
Here's the lineup.
Leading off in pitching is Bobby M.
Batting second and catching...
I'm sure that must be him, the one with the beard.
Kate Palmer thinks he's a spy.
Imagine the covert activities.
Hi, Jeanne.
- Play ball!
- Men, let's take the field.
Come on.
Show 'em what you got.
Let's see some energy here.
Let's try and win one.
Coach moved me over to right field, and that guy's a lefty.
It's all in the way you see it.
Just slow the ball down in your mind and let it float.
Take your position.
All right.
Get out there!
Good eye.
Hang on to it!
What, are you sleeping, Brian?
Right here. You're good.
- Brian, stay awake, son!
- Hey, Coach!
What do you guys do at practice?
Come on. Be ready to move.
Eyes, eyes!
Go home! Hustle!
Throw it to home!
Lee!
Move and concentrate.
Remember what we talked about.
Just get an out.
Base hit now. Base hit.
Mine!
You idiots!
Oh, my goodness!
Tom, you caught it!
I got it. I caught it!
It worked!
All right, Holman!
- Gunny, did you see that?
- Mommy, my stomach hurts.
My stomach hurts.
Oh, Gunny. Okay.
All right, sweetheart.
Let's go.
Come on. Let me carry you.
Put your head down.
Maybe it's just the sun.
Yeah? Maybe too much sun.
- Could you make sure Tom gets home?
- Sure.
Thank you.
He's had a shot.
Let him sleep as long as he can.
Is it the flu or...
We'll know when we run some tests.
I saw you.
At least we were closer this time.
Nah, close is for horseshoes and grenades.
But it worked, everything you said.
I never hit a homer before.
Hey, nice game.
Thanks.
You think we can get a ride?
I'll ask.
- Dad.
- Leland's dad is really cool.
He even started a club.
Hurry up.
We're not going that way.
Sorry.
Yeah, okay.
Need a lift?
Yeah.
I don't wanna have an X ray, Mommy.
It won't hurt a bit, sweetheart.
And then we'll go right home, okay?
Just one more.
You can put your arm down now.
- I'm scared.
- You're doin' great, buddy.
Turn over.
This will be the last one,
I promise.
Welcome back.
Do you believe in magic?
Of course I believe in magic.
I even know a couple of stories.
You wanna hear one?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Well... it begins with a little boy... and his brother and their mother.
They had some real problems.
So one day they met a man who was hurt... and they stopped to help him.
- Did the man have a dog?
- As a matter of fact, he did.
But it wasn't really a dog, was it?
- I'm sorry. I heard a noise and came...
- That's all right.
I... iron when I can't sleep.
And tonight
I'm having a drink.
Sometimes it's the right thing.
Especially if you have company.
You know, to most people I know... a mother of two having a drink at 3:00 in the morning in the garage... is a scandal.
Not to you.
No, not to me.
Touche.
Sit down if you like.
Yes.
That's Blue Bear.
Jeffrey bought it for Gunny on his last day of leave.
Gunny has cancer.
Life needs a new rule.
Only one tragic death per family... and kids are off-limits.
At least Jeffrey died for a reason.
Maybe that's important for you to believe.
What do you mean, it's important for me?
How dare you.
How dare you!
He died for peace.
I think you should go.
Because nobody's gonna tell me my husband died for nothing!
I didn't say "for nothing."
I did.
Oh, God!
Oh, he should be here.
I promised him
I'd look after them.
I promised him.
Oh, my sweet boy.
Oh, my God!
You're not alone.
Okay, hot potato.
Now breathe this time.
Relax.
Breathe.
Don't forget to breathe.
Hey, guys. Come here.
Jack, these are the guys.
Brian, Scott,
Little Leland Sackin the Third...
Bobby M., Bobby R., Bobby C...
Richie, T-Bone and Del, Junior.
They wanna know if you can help them the way you helped me.
So you guys are here because you wanna win, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
So the first thing you're gonna do... the most important thing... is forget all that.
What?
So I want you to take your gloves off and throw 'em right here.
- You wanna play better, don't you?
- Yeah.
Take off your mitt.
What is this?
If you resist a force, that's what you're gonna get, is resistance.
Yet if you go with it, what you get is power.
That's hard to understand.
I'd like you all to sit up.
Cross your legs.
Sit up straight.
Breathe. Just think about your breathing.
Baseball is not just hitting and fielding.
More than anything, it's thinking.
What you think and how you think it.
Starting with this.
- You're up.
- Good morning.
Morning.
Believe it or not, I decided to make a real breakfast.
- Can I help?
- No.
Everything's fine.
There's coffee.
You don't drink coffee.
Guess what, Gunny?
I made your favorite. Pancakes.
I don't want to eat, Mommy.
Please, sweetheart.
Just try a little bit.
I don't feel like trying.
Did you like it?
Well, I'm surprised.
It's a really expensive gift.
Yeah, well,
I've got money saved.
I know you're not my dad or anything... but I just wanted to give it to you.
I don't shave.
In case you ever want to sometime.
Why would I want to?
Everybody else does.
So if I shave
I can be more like them... and I can really start to fit in, huh?
I'm not like them, Tom.
You know that.
They're not even like each other.
They just think they are.
You're saying I should be myself, aren't you?
Well, since it's the only thing you can be, it might be a good idea.
And it'll be enough, if you let it.
- What are we here for?
- Victory!
- How are we gonna win?
- Big!
- Win!
- Big!
- Who's gonna win?
- We are!
Tool and Die!
If you push too hard, you'll get the opposite of what you're trying for.
Everything contains its opposite.
And om.
Hey, Herb, Jim.
What are they doing?
I don't know.
Look at them.
- They're in a circle.
- Singing something. I don't know.
I'm gonna find out.
What the hell's going on there?
I don't know, and I don't ask.
- Are you going to let that guy...
- He's a beatnik! He's running the team?
That beatnik is Jack McCloud, star rookie of the White Sox, 1941.
Says who?
Official records.
Something about him was bothering me, so I looked it up. He was a pitcher.
Won 25 games.
He was gonna be one of the great ones.
Then he just dropped out at the end of his first season.
Never heard of again.
You're saying we've got a major leaguer right here, coaching our kids?
That's what I'm saying.
Oh, yeah? I'll believe it when I see it.
Phil? Hi. I'm back.
I thought I heard Gunny.
Yeah, it's not too bad for long distance.
Right.
Uh-huh. Yeah. Minnesota?
I thought you were in Chicago.
Oh, sure. Mayo Clinic.
Of course I've heard of it.
You did what? You got Gunny into the Mayo Clinic? Really?
Oh, a week from Wednesday.
Yeah.
I'm really happy.
What I'll do,
I'll check with his doctors...
What do you mean you already did that?
Well, l... I think you should have asked me first.
All right. No. I understand.
Batter up!
- Let's go!
- Swing away. Come on! Let's go.
Be a hero. Line drive!
Score us a run.
You gotta go, okay?
Top of the sixth.
Defense!
All right, Bobby, right in there.
Keep your eyes open!
Let's see some fire.
Come on.
Go!
Home!
- Home!
- Slide!
You're out!
Yes!
My boys are playing baseball!
I thought that!
He hit him!
Take the walk!
Take your base.
Control!
Use control!
Come on! Be a hero!
- Keep your eyes open with these guys.
- Okay, Stretch.
Put it over. You can do it.
Right down the middle.
Just put it right past him.
- That was on purpose!
- Come on!
Run down to first.
Make him throw strikes here.
You gotta be a hero now, guy.
This is it.
Come on!
All right, Little Lee!
Strike one.
Two more.
Gotta get this one.
Strike two.
You can do it. One more.
I know you can do it.
Strike out.
Yeah. Easy out.
- Pop it up.
- Yeah. Strike out.
Let it go by.
- Just miss it. Pop it up.
- What the hell?
Everything contains its opposite.
You were playing baseball today!
- Boy, yes!
- I'm very proud of you.
Sundaes at Howard Johnson's, the whole team. My treat!
Everybody line up here.
- Smile.
- Where's Tom?
- Come on.
- Team picture.
Come on. Jack.
Can't do this without you.
Oh, please.
He did a pretty good job, didn't he?
Okay, I can admit it when I'm wrong.
- Just think, we didn't even know him.
- Hell, let's get to know him.
- Cheese.
- Good. Great picture.
Say, Jack.
- I'm Leland's dad, Leland.
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Great job.
So a few of us planned a camping trip.
Gonna have some fishing.
- Why don't you and Tom join us?
- We'd be proud to have you.
Give us a chance to say thanks.
I really appreciate it, but I don't fish.
Come on.
Come along anyway.
Tom would enjoy it.
You don't want to let these kids down, do you?
After they worked so hard.
Please?
No, I don't.
Good. We'll call you later.
- Come on, son.
- We'll call you. Come on, Lee.
Thanks, Jack.
Tom? Your ride's here, hon.
What are you gonna wear?
Something lavender?
I don't know.
Wait, come here.
Promise me.
Life preservers in the boats.
- Mom.
- Tom, please.
- Bye, Tommy.
- Bye, Aunt Joyce.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
- Just call me Davy Crockett.
- I will. Bye.
It's just great.
Come on, Jack.
Tommy, hop in our car.
My God.
You're falling in love.
With the wrong man.
What are you talking about?
Look, I admit
I can understand the attraction.
What are you talking about?
All right.
But it's Tom who's going to be hurt... when he finds out you can't turn a drifter into a father.
Please. The real you.
- Okay, everybody out.
- Everybody grab some gear.
Jack, you wanna help us get this fishing gear off here?
Jim and I'll get the canoe.
- I'm getting a thousand pounds.
- Oh, come on.
Hey, look!
I got a date with that one in November.
Pow!
Little Lee? You boys start doing the tents.
- Shot down on third base.
- My wife's hitting me like this.
This is our kid doing this!
He steps on the bag.
Throws it to first base.
We got three outs in one inning.
The side's retired.
I'm proud of you.
Hey, Jack.
I got a question for you.
Are all ballplayers as quiet as you?
Well, not these sluggers.
We been waiting around all night.
Tell us about the majors.
A good time on the road?
I mean for a man who's not married.
- Did you make a lot of money?
- Hey.
- How come you quit?
- Got a baseball card?
- You were in the big leagues?
- What hole you keeping your head in?
- How come you never told me?
- It's called humility.
It's a damn rare quality these days.
But you can't put it by us.
We know your stats. White Sox.
- '41, twenty-five wins.
- Wow.
- Twenty-five wins?
- Neato.
That is some record.
But it's not mine.
You've got the wrong
Jack McCloud.
You mean you never played pro ball?
- No, sir.
- The minors?
Looks like we jumped to some conclusions here.
What this means is...
- This whole thing's a mistake.
- No, it's not.
It's bullshit.
Hey, we had a great game, and that's all that matters.
- Like hell it does.
- Lee, we're here to fish. Remember?
L... Guys...
What are you sitting around here for?
There's a lake full of fish out there, and we promised you some night fishing.
Let's go. Get your gear.
Let's go night fishing.
Come on now and get your stuff.
- Come on.
- Tommy, you come with us.
Hurry up.
Let's go.
I'm sticking with Jack.
Let's go. He's gonna stay.
Come on, guys.
You know you are free to change your mind.
Yeah.
But I don't want to.
- Well, I think...
- Thanks for bringing that.
- Would you like some now?
- No, thank you.
Why don't you sit down?
- Sure.
- No. Over here.
Will you marry me?
Oh, Phil.
It's exquisite.
So will you marry me?
I don't know.
I just don't know that it's the right time.
No, for good times and bad times.
That's the whole idea. Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
And when we get back from Minnesota... there's a house I want to show you on two acres of land.
Stop. Please, stop.
I've decided against the trip.
- What?
- Yes. You see...
I've decided. Memorial Hospital has an experimental program... that's very promising.
It's much closer than the Mayo Clinic... and I know Gunny.
I know Gunny.
And he will be much better if he can stay closer to home.
This is nonsense.
You're letting sentiment get in the way.
Sentiment! Get in the way of what?
Of what I am trying to do!
Now, let me handle it.
This is a question of what's best... not what's easy.
You're right.
And this would be easy... but it will never be best.
I'm sorry.
I'm terribly sorry.
Hey, Jack.
We don't even know what time it is.
That's right.
We can just go down this road and see what's there.
I wish we were going all the way to the salt flats, don't you?
Yeah.
Maybe for my birthday.
It's in October.
Is that a good time to go to the flats?
- October? No better time.
- I've never been on a trip before.
Ever.
But my mom would let me, as long as it's with you.
I thought you ironed when you couldn't sleep.
That's Tuesdays.
I save Thursdays for closets and drawers.
I'll remember that.
Hey, Mom.
I'll take out the garbage.
- What are you so happy about?
- Nothing.
After lunch, you wanna throw the ball around a little?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Hey, we really missed you camping!
But don't worry, we brought you something. All the fish guts.
- To go with your fish face.
- Fish slime!
Hello?
He's outside.
May I take a message?
Oh. Uh-huh.
To have his cast removed.
All right.
I'll tell him.
Okay. Bye-bye.
Jack isn't gonna leave, is he?
Just because his cast is coming off?
Are you gonna ask him, Mom?
Dr. Pavlick's office just phoned.
A reminder about your appointment.
Just one last bit.
There we are.
Hey, not bad.
Hold on.
Well, you're a free man.
Don't be silly.
It's very pretty.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Looks good.
- Got enough there, Tom?
- I'm saving room for seconds.
- Hi, Coach.
- Hi.
Would you like to join us?
We just sat down.
No, thank you. Keep eating.
I don't mean to interrupt.
What I have to say to Jack
I can say pretty quickly.
First, I wanna apologize for the mix-up.
I can get pretty carried away... about sports.
But I don't care who you are or who you're not.
You did one hell of a job with that baseball team... and I want you to coach with me.
You'll do it, won't you?
I really appreciate the offer.
Season's over for me.
I sincerely wish you luck.
They're great kids.
Well, I had to ask.
We'll just go on what you gave us.
See you at practice, Tom.
You don't have to leave just because your cast is off. Tell him, Mom.
He'll say yes, if you ask him.
I can't do that, Tom.
Jack has his life... and we have ours.
Yes, you could.
Please, honey. Don't be difficult.
You're old enough to understand this.
You always say that... when you don't have a reason.
Remember the story you told me about the man and the dog and the family?
I know what the dog really was.
A genie.
She's got a lot of names... and she took on a lot of different forms.
She travels all over the world granting wishes to people who do good deeds.
And because that family was so kind... the genie granted them three wishes.
One for the mother, one for the big brother and one for the little boy.
But what did the little boy wish for?
I'm not sure.
What do you think?
I know what he wished for. He wished to be a firecracker. Fourth of July.
Well, if he was a firecracker, he wouldn't be a little boy anymore.
So don't you think he'd wanna stay a little boy?
I know. He wanted to fly up in the air... and see the fireworks and be real close.
Now, that is a fine wish.
Did the man get a wish too?
He got his wish a long time ago.
But there was nothing he wanted.
Now you go to sleep.
Nothing?
Well... once he was in a war... and that changed all the things that he thought were important.
He didn't know what he wanted anymore.
Did the genie help him pick?
Well, I guess you could say she did.
You see, the man gave his wish back to the genie... and she made a wish for him instead.
What was it?
The genie wished... that the man would travel around with her... so she wouldn't have to be lonely.
But she was really thinking of him... because there was... still something he needed to learn.
You don't wanna forget that.
I won't forget anything.
You know... if you really wanted a life like this one... you'd have it.
You would.
Yup.
You gonna be okay?
Yes, I am.
I'll be fine.
On my own.
Thinking about Gunny.
All I want is for him to be all right.
He will be.
You sound so sure.
I don't know why, but I believe you.
Can I drive you to the highway?
I gotta go alone.
I came to say good-bye.
We all lose things, Tom, every day.
Some things are so small we hardly notice.
Then others hurt a lot.
But you know what?
If we don't give up, we'll get to see... that we're always getting something else instead.
Like what?
Depends.
Today you choose.
Whatever you want.
Mean it?
As long as you don't wish for me to stay.
So what do I care, anyway?
If you don't make a wish,
I'll have to make one for you.
Big deal.
You don't fool me.
You're just a bum.
That's all you are.
Just a bum.
Good-bye, Tom.
Jack! Jack, wait up!
Take me with you.
Mommy, I'm really hungry.
That's great. And you tell me if you feel cold, all right?
Okay.
Have you seen Tom anywhere?
I want you to wait right here.
Stay here. I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go look for Tom.
Have you boys seen Tom?
No, ma'am.
You didn't see Tom coming up the road?
We got a crasher, guys.
Don't look down.
Give me your hand.
You're a gutsy guy, aren't you?
Whoa!
Where have you been?
Why do you do those things?
You scared me, sweetheart.
Mrs. Holman?
I heard it on the radio.
What a day.
Think of how the family must feel.
What's going on?
Dad?
Gunny, get up here.
In the summer of '55... the Republic of China released
15 American fliers... taken prisoner during the Korean War.
My father was one of them.
I don't remember much about the weeks that followed... except that I was happy all the time.
And there was something else.
Gunny began to get well.
It was hard to imagine so much good fortune all at once.
I believed it had something to do with Jack... the man who was neither sailor nor spy... not a beatnik or a baseball star.
He was just Jack.
And he had made a wish for me.
Tom, where are you going?
Son of a bitch!
- Betty Jane?
- Hello, Tom.
What are you doing here?
You never did get it, did you?
Get what?
You never understood my wish.
My father coming home.
- I got that.
- That wasn't it.
You always wanted what you didn't have.
My wish for you... was that you'd find happiness in whatever you got.
What have I got?
Look around you, Tom.
Get out of the car and stretch our legs.
Why don't we play a game?
You're it!
All right!
Thank you.
Katherine.

Sometimes, I think about what we must sound like to God.
How does He know who's in trouble and needs help?
How did He know to come to us?
What you are about to see is true.
The names have not been changed... because nobody believes me anyway.

Let the church say, "Amen."
Look at this, Osbert.
Ninety-six dollars and a button.
Button! Who would put a button in the collection...?
Oh.
- Times are hard, Saul.
- The church can't pay its bills on that.
Amen.
Beloved, in our exploration of the text today...
I would like to talk to you about temptation.
Mm-hmm.
Amen.
And not just the kind you find in the liquor store or someone else's bed.
I'm talking about temptation of the soul.
Mm-hmm.
The kind that just kinda, kinda... kinda creeps up on you without you even knowing it.
- But God knows.
- % God knows%
God is that little voice inside that says, "Don't give in."
% Don't give in%
- Don't give up.
- % Don't give up%
Be gone, temptation!
He knows you're tired.
That's why He says,
"Lean on me."
% Lean%
- % Lean%
- Aw.
He knows you're tempted.
That's why He says,
"Grab on to me... and together we will rise above."
Amen.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you... thought I needed some help in there.
Well, when I realized you were doing one of Daddy's old sermons...
I thought maybe you did.
I was... hoping that he could make a difference, even if I can't.
If you ask me, you did even better than he did.
Really.
I appreciate your support, honey.
Father, forgive me.
I'd like to talk to you about temptation.
The kind that creeps up on you.
And that's me, Jeremiah.
Are you after Daddy's job already?
Well, this is the story.
My didn't-make-it-up story.
- It was one week before Christmas.
- Come on.
The Christmas
I learned all about miracles.
I asked Santa Claus to bring me a brother for Christmas.
Well, Santa doesn't make those kinds of deliveries, baby.
Oh.
Can Hakim have lunch with us?
Well, I think Hakim's grandma might want him around today, you know?
But he's my best friend.
Well, maybe she won't miss him for a while.
- But then you and I are going downtown, okay?
- Okay.
- Be careful crossing the street.
- I will.
- Look both ways.
- Hakim!
- Don't wake his grandma.
- Hakim!
Come on, come on!
Hurry up! All right!
Let's play, Jeremiah!
Okay.
Let's build a snowman.
Come on over here.
Come on over here.

Child, I'm the only help in this house.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Now that was a lovely sermon.
Even better the second time.
Mama, please.
I told you about smoking in the house.
You shouldn't be smoking at all.
Well, there's a lot of things
I shouldn't be doing at all.
Oh, poor Hakim.
Bad enough his mama ran out, but to leave him with his grandma.
Bessie Adams can't take care of no five-year-old!
You know that woman's two days older than dirt!
Well, she won't have to much longer.
- Child Welfare's gonna take him now.
- What?
Julia, they're closing the youth center today.
I have to say good-bye to the kids.
What is his problem?
There is no problem, Ma.
Yeah, and I'm the Queen of the Nile!
Julia, something's been going on in this house for months now.
I can hear it in your voice over the phone.
- Mom, maybe you've been dialing the wrong number.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, somebody just better get their house in order. That's all I know.
- Well, don't look at me, Ma, okay?
- I'm lookin' at you!
All right. Well, Mama, you can look at me from behind.
Girl, don't be talkin' to me about your behind. I gave you that behind!
I don't even know why I bother wearing this.
It's not doing anyone any good.
And neither am I.
Lord...
I know You're especially busy this time of year, but...
I'm just a little tired.
If You get a moment,
I sure could use some help.
- Mine's bigger!
- Mine's bigger!
- Mine's much bigger!
- Mine's bigger!
Why did you throw snow at me?
It's all down my neck!
Wow.
- Huh?
- Where'd you come from?
You okay?
No.
You okay?
No. Aaaaaaah!
Hide, run, Hakim, run!
- Wait a... Wait a minute!
- Quick, hurry!
- Here. Hide here.
- I'm here! I'm here!
I'm here!
Thank You, Dear God.
Thank You.
I'm here!
- What's he doing?
- Huh?
I'm here!
I'm here!
Ma, it's a snowman.
A real one!
Joe Hamilton's tearin' down everything. Why's he doin' it?
Yeah, man, where're we supposed to chill at now?
They're tryin' to see us get locked up or shot or something.
Listen to me, listen. It just means you've got to work that much harder... try that much harder to stay out of trouble.
- I'm gonna do my thing.
- Peace, man.
- I'm sorry.
- Where are we supposed to go now?
- I don't know, man.
- You did your best, pastor.
Yeah, you tried.
- Thank you, son.
- Bye.
- Y'all take care of yourselves.
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.
- Well, it's too cold to stay out.
Tough break, huh?
Kinda seems like they're all tough these days.
You Henry Biggs?
- Yes, I'm the pastor over at St. Matt's.
- Bingo!
Every Friday, 8:00.
- My name's Dudley.
- Nice to meet you, Dudley.
- Pleasure.
- You a reporter?
- No. No, no.
- Social worker?
- No, I'm here in answer to your request.
- My request?
For help?
Is this some kind of joke?
Uh, no, no.
He doesn't make jokes.
He?
Capital "H", capital "E".
I want you to know that together the three of us... can help get you through this little crisis you're having.
- Look, I don't know who you are.
- Dudley, I'm Dudley.
- Or who put you up to this.
- He did.
But I'm afraid you picked the wrong day for me to be a good sport.
- Now, will you excuse me?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- Wow.
I'm sorry.
I'll, uh... try another approach.
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Thank you, sister. Merry Christmas.
I've been waitin' a long time for this.
- Yeah?
- Yes, sir.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, don't that cheese burn the roof of your mouth?
Hmm?
Um...
Uh, you... you know Reverend Biggs?
- Sure, from St. Matt's.
- Yeah, that's the one.
Stubborn, isn't he? Kinda short with people too. Didn't you notice?
This man right here?
Not that I know him that well.
I'm just...
- He came to the hospital every day after my wife's surgery.
- Every day?
He baptized all five of my kids.
- All five of them?
- Yeah. Give me this.
- Wait. I didn't mean anything.
- Go on, get on out of here!
You better go. Get on outta here.
And don't come back.
I'm telling you, Mama, he was there.
Like he fell from the sky.
Then he did a dance and jumped around.
Mommy's gonna stop giving you sugar cereal in the morning, baby.
- Come on. Who's that?
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa Claus!
- Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Santa.
- Thank you, little bro.
- Here, put some money in.
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- Thank you, sir.
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you, buddy.
- Osbert! Merry Christmas!
- How've you been, sister?
- Shh. Mm-mm.
- Come on, Jeremiah.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, brother.
God bless Mommy and Daddy and Grandma and Hakim.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Okay, fella, let's get into bed.
Legs under.
Thank you.
All right.
I'm going to be sad when he goes.
We all will.
We'll all miss Hakim.
Will I have to go live with another family too?
Of course not, Jeremiah.
Of course not.
Get some sleep.
I will if you sing to me.
All right.

- Come on, let's get in the car.
Pull up the car! Come on!
Let's go! Get in! Go, go, go!
Over here! Over here!
Help me, help me, look!
- Hey, hey, calm down.
- They robbed me! They broke my window!
- That's him over there!
- That's him? Freeze!
- That's him over there.
- Don't shoot.
- Turn around!
- That ain't mine, man. He dropped it.
- Get against the wall.
- I was returning a tape, man.
I live right down the street.
That was you.
I saw you break my window!
- I was at the ATM.
- You have the right to remain silent.
I have the receipt in my pocket!
Billy looked so sad. Why did they have him in handcuffs? He's not a criminal.
Do you think they'll give him dinner?
He hasn't had anything since lunch.
- I know he's hungry.
- He'll just be there overnight.
His bail hearing will be set for sometime tomorrow.
Has he ever been in trouble before?
- Two years ago.
- Oh, great!
I was able to get the judge to give him probation, as long as I found him a job.
- And you did.
- I promised I would straighten him out.
Looks like I didn't do such a good job.
Oh, no.
He's a different kid now.
Watches the little ones while I'm at work.
I don't know what I'm going to do if they take him away from me.
- Don't worry. We'll talk tomorrow.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Saul, Saul, Saul! Over here!
Look, kids!
We don't have to walk.
Come on, kids.
Come on, kids.
- Henry.
- Let's go. Watch your brother.
No fingerprints on the windshield, if you please.
Try to keep the feet off the seats, too, huh?
All right.
Get on, sweetheart.
- Feet on the floor, please.
- They are!
- Me too.
- King Saul's Charter Service.
- We make jail calls.
I appreciate it, Saul.
We all do.
You're a minister, you know.
You're not a social worker.
I'll file a complaint.
See you.
All right, y'all.
Everybody sit down, now.
Sit down, put your seat belts on.
Nobody gets carsick, do they?
- I do!
- Just stick your head out that window!
- Go on. It's not that cold out!
- Saul!
What did they give you?
They give you eggs? Oh, no!
Okay.
Come on.
Great.
Lord, if You are really up there...
I need some help.
- Henry?
- You again.
- Yep.
- What do you want from me now?
Uh, wait. I'm supposed to ask you that question.
Right now, all I want is to put my key in the ignition... turn it and have it...
- What else?
Oh, I suppose you think that you...
Who are you?
Really?
All right, but it might be best if you don't tell anybody else.
No. No.
My name's Dudley, as you remember... when I saw you at the Youth Center, and...
I'm an angel.
I beg your pardon?
An angel.
You know, like in the Bible?
Of course you are!
The angel Dudley?
- % Ding%
- That must have been that part of the Bible that got lost.
I knew you wouldn't understand.
I know you don't believe me.
It's hard, even for you.
But angels cannot lie, Henry. We're not allowed to. It's in the angel handbook.
- Of course it is. No, that's okay.
- I'll show it to you.
- No, I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna show you.
- That's okay. Okay, fine.
Thanks for everything. Say hello to the Big Guy and the Easter Bunny too.
- Wait, wait, wait. Can I exp...
- It's freezing.
- Let's get a cab.
- Can't afford one.
Can I get in?
Yes, it's cold out and...
Get in.
- You've got a good heart, Henry.
- Come on.
- You've got a good heart.
- Yeah, a good heart.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Don't draw on the window.
Oh, God.
I miss this place, Henry.
I had some wonderful times down here, I tell you.
Oh, I'm not supposed to go into how l...
Ohh. The seat belt, please.
But, as you can see,
I was cut down in my prime.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Ever since then, Henry,
I've been up there... waitin' in line for a chance to get sent back down here.
- It's a long line, too, let me tell you.
- You don't say.
Oh, I do say.
You've got no idea what the competition is like just to get sent down here.
Everybody wants this job.
I don't know why
He sent me, Henry, but I'm glad He did.
- Yeah.
- And I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, I need to go over the rules, if that's okay with you?
- Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary.
- It'll only take a second, Henry.
- Oh, all right.
- "Rule Number One: We can't do anything you should be doing."
That makes sense. If I'm doing it, that'd be two of us, wouldn't it?
Exactly. "Number Two: Everything you do must be done of your own free will."
- Now, that's a biggie.
- Tough, but fair. Are there many more?
Finally, when I leave, when the mission is accomplished, you won't have any memory of me.
That's my favorite.
Okay, so I got my rules.
Where can I drop you?
- Uh, how about right here?
- Good.
- See you later, Henry.
- Um...
Uh, ooh, ooh...
Hold... Wait a minute.
Look. If you...
If you really want to talk to me, my office is always open.
- Just make an appointment.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Feel it?
Kinda like springtime and Mom's home cooking all rolled into one?
I don't feel a thing.
You will.
Have faith.
Good night, Henry.
Good night.

Julia, we've always done it like this.

No, no, I have not.
Good TV tonight?
What do you see when you look at a place like this?
I'll tell you what I see.
Sterling Acres.
- The latest development miracle from Hamilton Realty.
- Well, not anymore.
I see 200 luxury apartments.
Over here, a 24-hour health club, right on the grounds.
State-of-the-art security, designer interiors you have to see to believe.
The kind of homes that you deserve!
And I know, because I'm Joe Hamilton... and I care about the things you care about.
He's so oily, you can fry chicken on that man's smile.
Hmm.
- He called here tonight.
- Huh?
Said there's a meeting at his office tomorrow at 11:00.
He's got something he wants to show you.
Now, Henry,
I know it's none of my business...
I'm glad you realize that,
Marguerite.
I'll be in my office.

- It's the boiler!
- Don't forget your coats.
Need to be now.
This is all I need.
Come on. Careful.
Be careful.
Julia, get everyone out of the building.
Come on, hurry, hurry.
Henry! The boiler!
- Yeah, I know it.
- Button up, button up.
What do you need?
Do you need anything?
Careful, Mrs. Havergal.
- You've got the devil in that basement there.
I know, I know.
Don't slip. I got it.
Careful, children, careful.
Oh, no, no!
Look at this.
Aww. Oh, no.
You could have given us one more winter.
- Is it open?
- Yes, Jeremiah. I left it open.
- Okay? All right. Sleep well.
- Okay.
Good night, Mommy.
What a night.
I don't even want to think about tomorrow... between the boiler and Hakim leaving.
Now, why... why are they gonna send that boy... to a foster home so far away?
I knew I should have called...
Honey, you called half the agencies in the state.
I know, I know.
But maybe the answer was in the other half.
I'm losing them, Julia.
One by one.
Hakim, Saul, Billy... the youth center.
I know it's my fault, but I just can't seem...
- You know, honey,
I had some thoughts on...
- Can we do this in the morning?
'Cause I'm beat.
Yeah, the morning's fine.
Good night, Julia.
Yoo-hoo! Mornin'!
Whoo!
I brought the mail in.
Anybody wanna open it?
Oh. Well, I'll just take my coat off... and bring it on into the office, then.
Look, I know things have been tough around here lately, and that's my fault.
But everything is gonna be all right.
- I'm comin'! Ooh! I got it!
Hello? Who?
- Mm-hmm.
- If only saying it made it all right.
- Yeah.
- You see? If you'd listened, you'd have heard an apology.
Not a big one, but a start.
- Uh-huh.
- No, what I heard is a man saying...
"How can I deal with this fast enough, then get on with the rest of my day?"
- You see, that's not fair.
- Oh, it's not fair?
Girl, I'm trying to listen!
Yeah, I'll give him the message. Uh-huh.
We've got to stop talking around Mama.
She knows too much of our business.
That was Anna Eldridge. Billy's bail hearing's been scheduled for 9:30.
9:30! We'll finish this later, honey.
I promise.
- Are you coming home after?
- Not right after.
- I have to be somewhere at 11:00.
- Joe Hamilton.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, Henry.
Do I look like I mind?
You ready to talk about this, little girl?
I don't know what you mean, Mama.
I think things are looking up for us.
Mmm-hmm.
There goes that behind again.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I didn't hear you come in!
You waitin' for the pastor?
Yes, yes.
My name's Dudley.
- Beverly.
- How are you?
- I'm the pastor's secretary.
- Pleasure to meet you.
You just missed him.
He went to court.
- These your children?
- Yeah, that's them.
Oh, they're beautiful.
Where was your husband?
Taking the picture?
Mm-hmm.
Then he took the car and the waitress at the diner and moved to Cleveland.
- Sorry to hear that.
- You have any children?
No, no. Never had a chance to settle down. I wanted to.
- You smell wonderful.
What do you call that?
Soap.
I haven't smelled a woman in such a long time.
I'll get you a bar for Christmas.
Do you have an appointment?
Uh, no, not exactly.
I was... sent to help the reverend, like an assistant.
Assistant? I haven't heard anything about no...
Oh, my Lord!
Am I gettin' fired?
No, no, no.
It's just temporary.
Temporary! I ain't heard nothing about no temporary!
- Well, there's nothing... Uh, look.
- Oh, God.
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Coffee!
You made coffee on that machine?
I've been trying for six weeks to figure out that machine!
My babies need new glasses, and I'm out of a job!
Look, mister, I have kids.
They're growin' like weeds.
And if you think I get a penny from that man, you got another thought comin'!
I can't take this!
Bein' fired!
Take it easy.
There's nothing to worry about. Here.
Oooh! Oooh!
Look at you.
You're crying.
Here, blow, blow.
Oh. I knew that.
Your Honor, my client,
Billy Eldridge... was sent by his mother to return a video rental...
It's all here, Miss Chattan.
Well, the Reverend Biggs is present in the courtroom... and he is willing to post bail.
This is a serious felony.
Bail is set at $ 25,000.
- Your Honor, I have evidence...
- May I address the court?
I'm turning it over for grand jury action. Next case.
We love you, Billy.
He didn't do it.
Clear the court.
What am I gonna do?
- Would you clear the court?
- I'll take care of it.
Next case.
I said, next case!
Pending 802, Harley Williamson.
- You could hide.
- Mm-mm.
- Take this. I'll bring him right out.
- Sure. No problem.
Here.
They might starve you.
Thanks.
Okay, they've got everything.
All ready to go.
Hey, guys!
Hakim, you remember
Robbie, don't you?
Hakim gets to ride in the train today.
Wow. A train ride.
We're running a little late.
Okay.
Take care of yourself, okay?
See you soon. Say good-bye, Jer.
Bye.
Take care.
Bye, Hakim.
We'll miss you.
Hold on, baby.
It's cold out here.
Who will I tell my secrets to?
Well, you can phone Hakim sometimes, okay?
And Mommy'll teach you how to write, so you can send him letters.
Bye.
I know You have a master plan, but... sometimes You're just a little tough to figure.
Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah.
- It's not fair!
Hakim left.
Julia.
This is Dudley, the reverend's new assistant.
Assistant? He wrote to the church council months ago for extra help.
Well, the extra help is here.
Oooooh.
But he didn't say anything about getting a response. Who sent you, exactly?
Uh, the, uh...
The Top Man himself,
Mrs. Biggs.
- Julia.
- Julia.
And this is Julia's mother,
Mrs. Coleman.
Of course it is.
Well, it's obvious where
Julia's beauty comes from.
Oh. And me with my hair lookin' like this.
- Oh, no. It looks magnificent.
- Why, thank you.
- Well, Mr., um...
- You can call me Dudley.
- Dudley. You're very welcome here.
- Thank you.
Excuse us.
What are you doing?
Now, that's what I call good-lookin'!
Your daddy used to look like that back in 19...
Ma, ma, ma.
I've heard it 100 times.
Yeah, well, maybe now, with him around, you'll have time to deal with some of your own problems.
The Good Lord's the only one who can do that.
- Honey, you don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do.
Ma!
I was gonna go over by the window, Julia.
There's too many rules in this house.
You're the man in the street... and in the snow and...
My name's Dudley.
I'm here to help your father.
- I'm Jeremiah.
- It's nice to meet you, Jeremiah.
You've got a real nice room here.
Thank you.
Wow, you've got a lot of neat stuff in here.
And what is this?
My toy ambulance is broken.
The battery got stole, and the lights don't work anymore.
Is that right?
I'll see what I can do here.
It never had a siren!
Never had a siren?
No.
You look sad there, Jeremiah.
Have you been crying?
Yes.
I'm sorry about your friend, Hakim.
What if I told you... that he's not really gone?
Hakim?
Did he run away and come back?
- No, he never left.
- Yes, he did. I saw him go.
Well, you know, my mother... once lost someone who was very dear to her.
He wasn't as young as Hakim, but he was... too young, just the same.
And she would always do something that seemed to make her feel better.
- You want to try it?
- Yeah.
All right, close your eyes.
Do you remember playing in the snow with Hakim?
Do you remember what his laugh sounded like?
Yes.
Do you remember what he looked like catching a ball?
He never caught the ball in his life.
But I remember.
That's because when God takes someone away from us...
He leaves what's most important about that person with us.
Right here in our hearts.
Yeah, but I still miss him.
Well, she still misses him too.
Are you all right?
Maybe you should close your eyes.
Mommy says I can write to him.
- Do you know how to spell his name?
- No.
- You want to learn? All right.
- Yeah!
- Hakim starts with an "H."
- And ends with "akim."
- There you go. Perfect.
Wow!
Fishies in a TV.
Windows.
Henry?
I know I said make an appointment... but I didn't say anything about filling out any form.
Beverly!
Beverly, I need you.
I gave her the day off to do some Christmas shopping, Henry.
You gave my secretary the day...
Yes, she needed some time off to be with her children... and I needed time to do my job with you.
- What job? What are you doing here?
- Henry, Henry, Henry!
How many times I got to tell you?
I'm here in answer to your request for help. And Julia's.
You can forget about the boiler.
You got more important problem...
Ah, here she is now.
- Henry?
- Wha...
Whoo! Lord have mercy!
Honey, remind me the next time I pay a visit, I wanna get paid! Okay?
- Hi, Dudley.
- Julia.
- Dudley. D-U-D-L-E-Y.
- Perfect.
- Very good.
- Poi-fect. Poi-fect.
- What happened with Billy Eldridge?
Uh, uh, the judge set the bail at $25,000.
- Henry, that child's still in jail?
- Julia, I did what I could!
Come on, sweetie.
We have a nativity play to rehearse.
You can't rehearse.
It's freezing in there.
Henry, I'll be chasing 15 kids all day.
I don't think I'll get cold.
And after we're through, you're taking your son shopping, remember?
- Henry.
- Huh?
Your wife's talking to you.
Oh, yes, uh, uh...
Hanley's, 1:00. 1:00?
Spell Hakim for me, baby.
M-l-K-A-H.
Dudley's teaching me to spell backwards.
Maybe he can teach Daddy how to be on time.
These are perfect. Beverly never typed a perfect letter in her life.
Yes, I did those myself, once I figured out that fish typewriter.
Let's get this straight, Dud.
I do not appreciate some stranger coming into my office...
Angels are hardly strangers, Henry.
And don't call me "Dud."
Julia, hold on! Wait for me!
Excuse me, Mother, not now. I'm having a little meeting. You understand.
- Bye, Marguerite!
- Bye, Dudley!
- Mama, come on!
- Start that rehearsal!
You are not going around telling my family this ridiculous story...
No, of course not.
They think the church council sent me.
The church council!
Why don't we continue this on our way to the meeting with Joe Hamilton?
The meeting.
- So, which floor is he on?
- I'm not telling.
- Henry, what's the floor?
- Go away.
- You asked for help.
- Not from you. I don't need you in here, out there or anywhere.
You didn't have to let the doors close on me downstairs, Henry. That was cold.
Well, I figured you'd just fly up.
You know, if you're really a you-know-what, where are your wings?
You're caught up in stereotypes, Henry.
That's your problem.
Hello, Reverend.
That's a beautiful dress you have on.
Just magnificent.
Why, thank you.
- You're very welcome.
Is Mr. Hamilton inside?
Oh, he's taping another TV commercial, but you can wait in his office.
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
Hamilton Realty.
Hi, Amy.
You know that old dress from Mom's closet? It's back in style.
"That's a lovely dress!"
It was a lovely dress. I mean, you gotta admit, it was a lovely dress.
What kind of angel talks like that?
The kind of angel that has good taste.
Well, you're still not going in here.
Henry, I'm like this with the creator of the entire universe.
- Now, you don't think a little door's gonna stop me, do you?
- Yes.
How? How?
Rule Number Two.
All right, fine, Henry. Can't make you do anything you don't wanna do.
That's right! That's right!
I always liked that rule!
Did you like that smile?
I tilted my head to the side.
I loved it.
- Henry Biggs.
- Joe Hamilton.
- How are you doing? Julia's good?
- She's very good.
- Uh, Henry, this is Debbie Page.
- Hi.
- She's the station manager over at WRKO.
They're televising your Christmas sermon this year.
We need to get your text for the TelePrompTer, Reverend.
- I'm working on it.
- Later, Debbie. Come on.
Let's see the guys.
- Wait 'til you see where you're gonna move to, Henry.
- What?
A planned community.
Your son could ride his bike to school.
- Mary?
- Henry!
Osbert?
What are you doing here?
Well, I, we, um... We came to check out, the same as you, Henry!
Saul.
Uh, listen to the man, Henry.
We think it makes sense.
Well, of course it makes sense.
That's what it's gonna look like when it's finished.
- What do you think, Henry?
- Isn't that nice?
It's a new city landmark.
It's a whole new neighborhood.
A different clientele, so to speak.
I'm hoping, with everyone here, we can once and for all... persuade you to move into the new world, Henry.
Well, all we need is a boiler that works... and we'll be fine in the world that we're in.
New boiler. Henry, look at this.
Day care facilities.
We need that.
We could sure use that.
Senior citizens' club.
- That's much better than ours.
- Mm-hmm.
- What I'm offering you here, Henry...
- Well, it is.
TV cameras and lighting built right in.
- Look at that!
- It's a pulpit to preach to the world!
It's beautiful!
All you have to say is,
"I'll do it."
Say yeah. Say yeah.
All right.
Look, say yes, and I'll throw in that new boiler.
I'll stop St. Matt's from freezing over Christmas... if that's the price
I have to pay to get you.
And if I accept, what price am I paying?
Henry, what you see there is the answer to all your problems.
Amen.
Isn't it?
- I need my Magi. The Magi's entrance.
- What does the sheep say in this play?
- Baaaa!
Ah. Mmm.
Does everybody know their parts?
You know your parts?
- What's my part?
- What's your part? You're a camel.
- I need my shepherds.
- I'm a shepherd.
- Come here. You two, over here.
- I'm the angel.
- In there. Come on.
Kick it, Mrs. Havergal.
Let's do this.

- Yeah.
- Again.
- All right.
You take this one solo, okay?
- Okay?
- Comet's swingin'!
- Ooh, look at that.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Sure is.
Go in and try it on.
We're supposed to be shopping for Henry, remember?
You with that nightgown on is all the gift Henry would want.
- Trust me.
- A gift from Jeremiah.
- Oh. Ho, ho.
- Mmm.
So how long do you think he's gonna be with that snake?
He'll be along soon.
How'd you two meet, anyway?
Hmm. We were in adjoining strollers, and, uh... and one day I took his pacifier, and he made a really big noise about it.
Who wouldn't?
You know, when he was about ten, he started wearing suits to school.
- What?
- Trying to impress me.
Obviously, it worked.
He'd walk me home... and I always thought he was cuter without his glasses, so... one day he took them off for me.
And he slipped on the ice, and fell right on his fanny.
Sounds like love to me.
Daddy said we were born friends.
He did a lot for Henry, your father.
He was the best.
Mommy.
Enough!
- Is it good, Dudley?
- Mm-hmm. Great.
How is your food, Jeremiah?
Mmmmm.
- Julia.
- Henry.
Ah, Jeremiah.
Dudley!
- Henry.
- Okay, Jer. Let's go shopping.
- Wait, honey. What happened?
- I'll tell you later.
- Come on. Come on.
- Henry, it is later.
It's about an hour later than when you were supposed to be here.
- Now, what happened?
- It's a long story.
You know, you and Julia need to talk.
I can take Jeremiah shopping.
I'm an excellent gift consultant.
Yes, Dudley.
I want Dudley.
Wait a minute.
I wanted to take him shopping.
You two have more important things to talk about.
- Dud-ley! Dud-ley! Dud-ley!
- Jeremiah.
We'll be right across the street at the toy store. Okay?
- Julia! Julia!
- Dud-ley!
- Jere-miah! Put your hat on.
- Dud-ley! Dud-ley!
- So, who are we shopping for?
- Grandma.
- Any idea what she wants?
- A new ashtray.
- Mom took all her old ones.
- Let's get something for Hakim.
So, what happened?
Julia.
L...
I've decided to accept
Joe Hamilton's offer.
Julia, did you hear me?
- I heard you. I just can't believe what I've heard.
- Then let me explain.
Excuse me.
Can I get you anything?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, thank you.
Okay.
Listen, Saul was there,
Mary Halford, Andy and Osbert.
But what were they doing there?
Every one of them was begging me, arguing with me, blackmailing me.
- Blackmail!
- They're gonna put in a new boiler tomorrow.
- Henry, he bought you for a boiler?
- Shh. Julia.
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse us.
Of course not!
- Oooooh...
- Julia, let me show you something.
Julia, Julia... he is building the most beautiful church you've ever seen.
Look at that.
Day care center, youth center.
Henry, he is building a shrine to himself!
Eight years, Julia.
And what do I have to show for it?
So you give up our lives without even talking to me, Henry?
This solves all of our problems, Julia.
Why can't you see that?
My father trusted you with St. Matt's.
How dare you walk out on it like this!
All right, all right.
Your father was a saint, and I'm not!
But I'm here, Julia, and he isn't.
I'm sorry, Julia.
Give me the car keys, Henry!
Julia!
- Julia, please sit down.
- Give me the keys, Henry.
Would you kindly give her the keys?
I have customers sitting here.
Sorry. Sorry.
Julia, please listen to me.
Henry, I can't.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Julia.
Come on, Jeremiah.
We're leaving.
I got Daddy's present.
And I bought a fire engine for Hakim.
It was on sale.
Yes, that's wonderful, honey.
That's wonderful.
All right. You're going to have to support him now, Julia.
You hear me?
Now is when he needs you most.
Mama, I can't support what's wrong.
Preachin' God's word is never wrong, no matter where you do it from.
He didn't even discuss it with me.
Daddy would have never made a decision like that without discussing it with you.
Sure he would. Your Daddy kept things from me all the time.
Especially church business.
Well, it was different in those days.
Those days!
Child, men ain't changed since Adam!
And he gave up one of his own ribs, just so he could have somebody to keep things from!
You know, gettin'angry at a dead tree is not gonna help.
Yeah, but it wouldn't look good to punch out a pastor, either.
No, you don't... you don't... you don't mean that...
'Cause you know you love him.
Yeah, he knows it, too.
That's the problem.
He knows I'll always be there, just like a pet.
- Ouch!
- See? God doesn't like ugly.
- Let me see.
You ever had your palm read?
Okay.
I see a beautiful woman with a good heart.
Only has to open her eyes to realize that everything she ever wanted... she already has.
You didn't even look at my hand.
But I held it.
Do you see Henry and me?
Hmmm... let's see.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Ohhh.
Oh, it's so hot,
I had to let it go.
You must be talking about my past.
- Mrs. Biggs, you forgot this.
- Thanks.
Every fire dies sometime,
Dudley.
What do you do when you have to decide if the memory of it is enough?
- What do you do?
- Yeah.
What you do is you... you go dancing, that's what you do. You go out.
- Dancing?
- Yes.
You're gonna go dancing, put on a beautiful dress, make your husband break out the cologne.
- Have you met my husband?
- That's right, I met him.
- He hasn't taken me out in...
- Far too long. That's my point.
But tonight's gonna be different.
Tonight you're gonna strike a match.
No, not a match, a, a firecracker!
You'll see.
You take your coat off, you go upstairs and you take your wife out dancing.
Can't do it.
Not tonight.
Henry, you and Julia need this.
Mr. Kingman needs his minister with him at the hospital, and the seniors need blankets.
You're only one man, Henry.
Things don't get fixed waiting for the next guy to do it.
- Including marriages.
- Dudley!
Henry!
You already told her, didn't you?
She's upstairs dressing right now...
- and once again
I'm gonna look like the bad guy.
- Not if you go.
- Dudley!
- What? I'm just trying to help you.
You're just trying to help.
All right, you can help... by taking her.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- You're missing the point, Henry.
- No, no.
The point is...
Mr. Kingman won't wait.
Now, you go, tell me all about it later.
- And you make sure you tell her I'm sorry.
- Ohh, Henry.
- Good night.
- Henry.
- Not too late.
- Henry.
- And no drinking.
It was not supposed to go like this.
Good night, Mommy.
Okay, good night.
Don't worry about us.
I'm gonna give 'em a hot bath... and then we're gonna play Monopoly... for real money!
Yea!
How do I look?
Oh! Oh, my!
Henry?
Henry? Henry?
- Where's Henry?
- He said... He said he's sorry.
- He's sorry?
- Yeah, he had to go.
One of the congregation is in the hospital. Mr. Kingman.
Oh, yeah.
He's been sick a long time.
I'll call his wife tomorrow.
Look, Julia, he suggested that I, uh... pinch-hit for him, if that's okay with you.
Hmm?
Welcome to Jazzie's, folks. Come on in.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- My brother.
Ahhh!
Nice, huh? Dancing. Do you dance?
I bet you're a good dancer.
It's been a long time.
You want to dance?
Why not?
- All right.
- Give it a shot.
- Bust a move. Right.
- Bust a move.
It doesn't seem like we're dancing right for this music, huh?
Get down.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean.
Yeah.
Oh, my.
Go, brother!
Ooh, hit it!
- What's he doing?
Mmm!
Ooh.
- What's that one?
- The Popeye.
- The Popeye. Okay.
- It's comin' back now.
- I guess.
Whoo! You get out about as much as I do.
Less! Even less!
Oh, there we go!
- Oh, you're swimming.
- Yeah, backstroking.
- Jules!
- Bristloe!
- How you doin', sweet thing?
- Oh, my Lord!
- I thought you were in Paris.
- I was, but I've been back a while.
You and Henry don't come by here much anymore.
Henry's been real busy.
But it's great to see you!
- You too! How you doin', sweet thing?
- Oh, I'm okay.
Dudley, Bristloe.
Bristloe, Dudley.
- Oh, hey. How ya doin'?
- A pleasure, a pleasure.
If Henry hadn't helped me with that plane ticket,
I never would've gotten to Paris.
I tell you,
I owe that man everything.
- You should call him and tell him.
- I will.
Do that.
He'd love to hear from you.
Why don't we all just sit down and visit?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.
So, Bristloe, are you and Maxine still together?
- Oh, you better believe it.
- Oh, good.
She still calls six times a day to make sure I'm being a good boy.
Fine woman, that Maxine.
You married, Dudley?
No, no.
No, I've never been lucky enough to meet someone like Maxine... or Julia.
Ain't that the truth?
Used to be a time this little girl could come by here every night.
- Yeah? You used to come in here?
- Sure.
Henry proposed to me right over there, in that booth.
- Get outta here! Right over there?
- That's right.
- Those were the good old days, huh?
- Sure were.
- Couldn't squeeze a dime between 'em.
- Whew.
She used to go on stage and torch the place down.
Get outta here.
Now she just sings for the Lord.
Not that that's bad.
No, no, no.
That's good.
Let me tell you somethin'.
Ever want to know what lovin' really sounds like...
- she's got that secret in her voice.
- Oh, Bristloe, please.
Why don't you share that secret with us, Julia?
- Come on, remind us.
- No. It's been years, a long time.
- You still do it in B?
- No, no, Bristloe. I don't do it at all.
Well, I'd like to know what love really sounds like.
- Well, that solves that problem.
- Bristloe.
- I don't know the song.
- Don't want to hear another word.
- I don't...
- We want to hear you sing.
You sang it for Henry.
I should be going home.
- We're going to play this in B.
Just follow me, okay?
- Okay.
- Follow him, guys.
- You go out there. Go on. Yeah.
- Go on, sing it for Henry.
No. No.
Here we go.
% I believe in you and me%
% I believe that we will be%
% In love eternally%
% Well, as far as I can see%
% You will always be%
% The one%

Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're bad.
One for you.
One for me.
And one for the tree.
- Thank you.
- I got your Christmas present yesterday.
You did?
What'd you get?
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.
What are you getting Mom for Christmas?
I don't know.
What do you think I should get her?
I think she'd like to go to bed.
Excuse me, young man?
She was looking at a nightie in the store window with Dudley.
Was she now?
All right, come on, young man.
Sleep time.
Wait for your mama to get home, you'll be too big for the bed.
Go get some more Vicks on your chest.
See if we can rid of that stuffy nose.
I think you were born with a stuffy nose. Come on, here.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.
Oh, thank you.
- Have a good evening.
- Thank you.
- Did you have a good time?
- Are you kidding?
I had a great time. You?
I had a ball.
You're not such a bad dancer.
- I haven't had so much fun in a long time.
- I did too.
- I heard you singing.
- Yeah, I was about to get up there with you.
- I'm so glad you didn't.
- % I believe in miracles%
- Shh! They're probably all asleep.
- Not all of us.
- Henry.
- Dudley.
I guess I don't have to ask if you had a... good time.
We did. We went to Jazzieâs.
Some of the old band was there, and...
You've been at Jazzie's?
Yeah. Yeah.
Bristloe was there too.
- Henry, your wife got on stage.
- Oh, wait, wait.
You went singing at Jazzie's all night?
- You told me to take her out.
- Not to the place where I proposed!
Henry, we had fun.
Remember what that used to be?
But honey. Jazzie's?
Well, maybe I sang at Jazzieâs because
I won't be singing in any Joe Hamilton church, wherever that may be.
- Thanks, Dudley.
- Good night, Julia.
- She had a good time, Henry.
- Oh, really?
Yeah. Yeah.
She told me about how you proposed.
- She showed me the booth.
- The booth?
I don't believe this entire situation!
No, you don't.
That's your trouble right there.
You don't believe in much of anything anymore, do you, Henry?
You don't believe in me.
You don't believe in yourself.
You don't believe you can make a difference anymore.
You don't even believe that Billy Eldridge is innocent.
Billy... Of course I do.
You don't sound very convincing, Henry.
I tried to help him before.
- Did you?
- Yes.
And besides, he doesn't even go to church.
Have you tried looking him in the eye and asking him to tell the truth?
No. You know why?
I guess I was just too busy having fun.
I guess that's your problem, Henry.
You're just too busy.
Your wife feels like she's in a marriage by herself.
Your son lost his best friend.
What are you doing about that, Henry?
You don't have to listen to me.
You're right.
But you ought to listen to them.
Come on, everybody.
Time to make the Christmas baskets.
Aren't you gonna help?
I miss Hakim.
I know.
But a lot of people are depending on us for those baskets.
- What do you think?
- Okay, then.
All right?
Gym socks. Now, nothing says
"Merry Christmas" like gym socks.
Ahh.
Uh, Billy.
Uh... here.
Thank you.
Billy, I need to talk to you.
You're wasting your time, you know that?
The grand jury's about to indict me in there.
You ever pray, son?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.
You're too hip for that.
All right. Okay.
- You play ball?
- Yeah.
When you play basketball, don't you hope that when you shoot the ball... that the ball goes into the net?
Yeah.
Well, that's all prayer is: Hope.
And helping to give people hope is what I do.
What's the point?
No one believes me anyway.
Billy...
Look at me, son.
Were you a part of this or not?
I swear, Rev, it happened just like I said.
I've messed up before, but I'm telling you the truth.
When was the last time you said a prayer, Billy?
I don't know.
Well, I think it's about time you gave it a try.
- What's the status of this case?
- Good morning, Judge!
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Reverend Biggs, this is not a playground!
It's a court of law!
I don't have time...
I work for an even higher court,
Your Honor, and I'm finding the time.
- I came to tell you
Billy Eldridge is innocent.
- I have your word on that?
- What does it take for me to show you?
- Let him in.
On his way to return a video, he got $20 from an auto-teller.
There's a time on the receipt.
- The victim identified him, Reverend.
The victim...
Saw him standing there, Your Honor, and that's all Billy was doing.
There's a grand jury hearing going on right down the hall... but the D.A. Won't even present it if you don't buy the evidence.
- And you know there isn't any.
- Reverend, come here. Come here.
I appreciate you wanting to help the boy.
The young man, Your Honor, helped himself.
He shows up every day to his $4.25 an hour job at Sampson's Stationery... a job he's held steady for two years... and he goes to school at night.
He came to a crossroads a long time ago, Your Honor.
And he chose the right path.
Now it's up to you... to judge not his past, but his future; not his failures, but his dreams; not his imperfections, but his possibilities.
Hallelujah!
% Hallelujah, hallelujah%
% Hallelujah%
- Is that Billy?
- % Hallelujah, hallelujah%
- It is!
- % Hallelujah% %
Mama, Mama, Billy's home!
- They're all waiting for you.
- Thanks a lot, Rev.
- You're welcome, son.
- I prayed for you, Billy.
Hey, Jessica!
I missed you.
Come here, kids.
How y'all doin'?
- Good to see you, son.
- Where the boys at?
Hey, bro, what's up?
God bless you, Pastor.
You guys get in the house.
- Billy's home! Billy's home!
- Come on, Mom.
- It's so good to see you.
Did they hurt you?
- No, they didn't hurt me.
Are you all right?
Are you hungry?
You're hungry. You're hungry.
Kids, get the good dishes out.
Two points.
He's doin' it better than you.
I don't know, Dudley. I'm a mother.
I can't die like this.
Time out. My feet sore.
I want to watch.
Okay, baby, you can watch.
- Whoa!
- That was fun.
- Whoa!
- Okay.
All right, you sit here.
- Okay.
- And Mommy'll be right over there skating, okay?
Keep warm, and the cocoa man is going to bring you something to drink, okay?
- Look out for Daddy.
- Hi, Lisa. Over here!
Come on, Julia.
- Mademoiselle.
- "Madame," please.
- And nothing too fancy, you.
- Oui, Oui.

- % That I might feel like this%
- All right.
- % Some kind of wonderful%
- You wait. I'll get better.
% There's nothing quite comparable%
% The thing about it is%
- Bend your knees. You're a natural.
I told you I'd get better.
I wonder where Henry is.
This time of day?
Probably stuck in traffic.
- % I'm about to lose a fight%
- Oh, come on!

- Damn! I don't believe this.

The movie's almost over.
I can help you with that.
- Oh, thank you.
- Madame.
All right, off with the boots.
Grandma's crying.
Yeah, baby, she cries at these movies every Christmas.
She cries at "Jingle Bells."
Ohh! So skatin' was good, huh?
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah, it was okay.
- It was nice. I had a good...
- It was a nice time.
- It was great. It was nice, skating.
- Grandma.
Yeah, we had a good time.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was great.
- I laughed a lot.

- Oh, my Lord.
- Ma, you said that already.
And I'm gonna say it again.
Oh, my Lord.
Ma, he's been very kind.
That's all.
At least he's got time for me.
Julia,
Henry can't be ten places at once.
And don't tell me that your daddy could.
Now pull yourself together, young lady.
You're a married woman.
Oh, Ma, I can look in the window.
Even if I don't buy.
Well, you just better not go window shopping with money in your pocket.
And you better not be puttin' anything in the layaway plan, either.
- You hear me?
- Oh, Ma.
% Two turtledoves%
- % And a partridge in a pear tree% %
- Let's do it again.
- Oh, no more, Jer, please.
- Oooh!
- Your dad's home.
Daddy, where were you?
I'm sorry, Jer.
I really am.
I just can't understand why the traffic was so bad. We'll go tomorrow, okay?
Okay. I did skating, Dad.
You did? Good for you.
And I got Billy Eldridge home for Christmas.
They dropped the charges, Henry.
How'd you do it?
I just remembered you gotta look someone in the eye to see if they're innocent.
So it wasn't that hard.
- Daddy?
- Yes, son?
- Skating isn't hard, neither.
- It isn't?
Your mom taught you, huh?
Dudley and Mom.
It was fun!
Dudley went skating with you?
We waited for you, Henry.
You didn't miss much at all.
Ah, Henry! Just the man I wanted to see. I've been working on this...
Keep away from my wife.
What'd I do now?
- You take her to lunch.
- Well, you were late, Henry.
- You take her to Jazzieâs.
- You asked me to.
You take her skating.
What kind of man do you think I am?
Keep the hell away from her.
Henry, you're a man of God.
That doesn't mean I'm blind.
Now, I've seen the way she looks at you.
Really? I mean, really.
All right, fine.
I want you to leave now.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
I don't think I can do that.
Check the angel handbook.
It says I can't leave until I'm through, I think.
You see, it says right here...
Wait a minute.
Hey! Henry!
What was that?
- Oooh!
- My goodness!
- What?
- You're in trouble.
What was that?
What is that?
It wasn't a sign that there's a new pope.
- What do you mean?
- You're in trouble.
You want me out of the house.
- Yes, I want you out.
- I'm not the problem. It wasn't me.
- It wasn't me!
- Who are you talking to?
Get out of my house!
What is going on in here?
- I am terminating Dudley's services.
- Is that what you want, Julia?
It isn't a question of what she wants.
All right, Julia, you're a part of this.
You say.
You two stop this right now.
Just stop it!
You hear me?
- You see what you did?
- It's not about me.
You and Julia would have these problems even if I never showed up.
You've forgotten what's important, for you and for her.
And you're going to remind me, I'm sure.
St. Matt's is more than just a church, Henry.
It's the glue that holds everything together in this neighborhood.
And you mark my word, without it, this neighborhood will fall, I guarantee it.
And Julia will never look at you the same.
Hey, handsome.
Come and walk me across the street.
I gotta take this plate over to Bessie Adams.
- Well, actually, I was...
- Walk me!
Delighted.
- I heard what you two were talking about.
- Really?
Now, you know I don't usually pry into other folks' business.
- Uh-huh.
- Hold on a second.
Mmm-mm!
Now, what are you doing to my daughter?
Mrs. Coleman, it's all right,
I promise you.
Nothin' is all right, Dudley, when I see a married woman look at a man that way.
I'm just tryin' to help them, that's all.
You really shouldn't smoke.
Our time here on Earth is precious.
That's right.
And you know the most precious time of all is time spent with your family.
Now, you know I'm supposed to only be here through Christmas.
But I will conveniently have a hip injury... and stay to the year 2000 if I have to.
Do you understand what I'm sayin' to you?
- I do now.
- Mm-hmm.
Look, I'm havin' a little trouble tryin' to get through to Henry.
Now, Julia, on the other hand, she's wonderful. She deserves...
What are you talkin' about what Julia deserves and what she don't?
She's Henry's wife.
Don't worry. L...
I'm sure she'll forget me as soon as I leave.
She'll forget herself if you go on like this.
Marguerite, is that you?
I'm comin', Bessie!
Now, Dudley, you are a charming person.
You go charm somebody else.
Okay?
Bessie, I'm comin' in.
Did I tell you I quit smokin'?
I'm so proud of you, sugar.
Watch it. Don't slip now.
Come on, babies, let's go. Thank you so much. Now you have a lot more room.
- Bye.
- Hi, Dudley!
- I'm just baby-sitting Jeremiah.
- Mommy, Mommy! Here, puppy.
- Get away from that dog!
- Go ahead!
- Jeremiah! Jeremiah!
Saul!
Where's he goin'now?
Thank you so much for the ride.
I know you had to go out of your way.
The first five minutes of The Nutcracker hasn't changed any since last year.
- I'll make 'em leave before the bows so we can come and get you.
- Oh, thank you.
- Um...
- Um...
- Thanks.
Okay.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!
No time for that, Saul.
Come on, we're gonna be late.
Oh, Santa, just leave that man under my tree... if he'll fit.

Oh, Keeleys...
Take a left at Woodlawn.
The Keeleys live on Sixth.
Henry, the Keeleys live on Woodlawn.
- You're jealous.
- I am not jealous.
- Yes, you are.
- I may be a lot of things, but jealous is not one of them.
Sure, you are. You're so jealous, you can't even think straight.
I am thinking just fine, thank you.
- You can't even remember where the Keeleys live.
- The Keeleys' house is on Sixth.
- Then what's it doing over there?
- What?
Hmm.
Keeleys moved.
Woodlawn. Sixth.
- Is this it?
- Mm-hmm. There's the house.
- Be careful, Henry.
- I will be.
Drive all this way, they're probably not even home.
At least they could shovel their walkway.
- Whoooaaah!
Henry!
What are you laughin' at?
You look like a kid.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Let me help you up.
Thanks, babe.
- Oh, baby. What are you doing?
- I thought you was helpin'me up.
- You did this on purpose.
Eddie, come here quick.
It's the preacher.
- What's goin' on?
- I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
- You all right?
- We're fine.
I told these kids to shovel that walk.
They ain't got nothin' on their mind but Santa Claus. Sorry.
- This is yours. Merry Christmas.
- Us?
- Merry Christmas.
- God bless you.
- You'll catch cold. Be careful.
- We will.
I'll see you on Sunday.
We'll be there. All of us.
Seems like we've been doin' this forever.
Forever is right.
Do you remember the first time?
- My mother was visiting, yeah.
- Yes.
- You know, Henry, she never liked me.
- No, no, that's not true.
She used to say, "Girl, you better get some meat on them there bones."
Well, she just wanted you to eat, that's all.
- No, she wanted me to be as fat as her.
- She wasn't that fat.
Henry, a policeman walk down the street, see your mama and go, "Break it up!"
- Stop!
Stop it!
Rest her soul.
It's good to see you laugh again.
It's nice to have a reason to.
You know, I miss this Henry.
I wish he'd show up more often.
There.
We did it.
I'm gonna go to the church for a minute.
You go on inside.
- There we go.
- Thank you.
- Don't slip.
- I won't. Don't be long.

- We could sell ads.
- I think it could work.
- Sounds okay to me.
- Mr. Hamilton?
- Is that gonna slow us down?
- Excuse me, Mr. Hamilton.
- Yes, Bernita?
- Reverend Biggs is here to see you.
- Henry!
- Joe.
Uh... Joe...
I need to speak with you.
Can we...
Go ahead. I have no secrets from my own people here. In fact, sit down...
I've reconsidered.
I don't want the job.
- Let's go, guys.
- I can't leave my own people, Joe.
And they can't afford to travel clear up here.
- And as far as moving, Julia and l...
- Henry, a deal is a deal.
My decision is final.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
Sorry is not good enough, Henry!
You don't get it, Henry.
I don't care about St. Matt's.
St. Matt's is where we've been, not where we're going!
Only if people like you abandon it, Joe.
You know, it used to be you couldn't just pick up... and move away from your own people as soon as you made a couple of bucks.
There was nowhere else for us to go.
But at least our kids got to grow up with their heroes.
Henry, I'm trying to be nice to you because you and I go back a ways... and the old reverend was always real good to me.
But this is gonna happen whether you want it to or not.
With all due respect, Joe, how do you think you can make me...
Not you. The church.
It's coming down.
What's coming down?
The church is...
Henry, do you know why I am a trustee of a church I don't go to?
Because your deacons all came begging to me, telling me how broke the church was.
I bought the mortgage.
That's right!
I own it, and it's coming down.
That land's worth a lot more to me with nothing on it.
- You're gonna tear down my church?
- That's right.
- A-And build a mall and tennis courts.
- Tennis courts?
Henry, we're gonna turn that neighborhood around, attract some real money to that place.
- Oh, I see. Yeah.
- You see what I'm saying?
You think without me there to lead them, the people will just cave in.
- That's why you got me here!
- No, Henry, I want you to lead them.
- But into the future.
- Whose future, Joe?
They don't play much tennis.
Joe, come back to the church.
See exactly who you'll be hurting.
See their faces, their families, their... their children, Joe.
People are a lot tougher than you think, Henry.
Henry, look.
Come on, they'll survive.
And you still think you care about the things we care about?
"Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger."
- That's what I say.
- Only louder.
"Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger."
Then Michael and Jessica come on... and sing a really slow song.
It's not that slow, and it's very pretty.
Meanin' to ask you, you two have a fight last night?
No, Ma, we delivered
Christmas baskets.
- The gym socks were a big hit.
- Huh! I knew they would be.
- That you were right about.
- Hi there.
- Henry.
- Hello.
Dad, Jason got sick, and I'm gonna be a shepherd in the nativity play.
- I won't have to say "baaa."
- Ohh.
- That's great.
'Cause someone very special is gonna be in the audience listening to every word you say.
Huh?
- Your mother and I figured out what you'd like for Christmas.
- Yeah.
- Did you wrap it up?
- Not quite.
Hakim!
I missed you.
Ohhh.
Is he going to stay forever and ever?
Well, just 'til the new year.
Then after that, we'll see.
I have a secret to tell you.
My ambulance has a siren now.
Really?
God bless Mommy and Daddy...
And Grandma...
- And my grandma.
- Amen.
- Okay, guys, you ready?
- We did our prayers.
'Cause we were already on our knees.
Okay. It's time to get into bed now.
Come on.
Boing!
All right.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
No talking late now.
Close the door, please.
Okay.
- Wait 'til you meet Dudley.
- Who's that?
- The man in the gray coat.
- Huh?
- You remember.
- Oh!
Christmas is supposed to be... the most joyous day of the year.
- Henry?
- Hmm?
- Would you like some hot chocolate?
- No, thank you.
I've got to check the fuse box.
If we put any more lights on that tree, we're gonna blow up the house.
Christmas is supposed to be the most joyous day of the year.
But for St. Matt's, it's a day to surrender.
Not because I'm going to preach at another church, as some may believe... but because the people who own the building are going to tear it down.
- Now, it's no one's fault.
There is no one to blame.
- Henry.
It just seems as though despite our best efforts, our dream...
- my dream for St. Matthew's... will not come to pass.
- Ohhh.
But let's remember the good things we've shared over the years.
The laughter, the exploding boiler... the sounds of voices raised to heaven.
I'll miss it all.
I thank you for your efforts.
I thank you for your friendship.
God bless you.
I love you all.

I'm Rev. Biggs' assistant.
- Wait in the living room, please.
- Thank you.
- Okay, Bernita, I'll take care of it.
I ain't buying!
For God's sake, it's Christmas Eve!
For the sake of God indeed.
Henry Biggs sent you here. I told him he's through. To hell with him.
No, to heaven with him, Joe. That's a plan not even you could mess up.
- Look, I don't know who you are, but...
- I'm an angel.
- No, not yours.
No, I'm afraid yours is a long way off.
I'm a very busy man, and you're wasting my time.
Now, I'm giving 'em another church.
St. Matt's is...
What is this?
It's like your past, Joe.
You can walk away from it, but it's still there.
What do you see when you look at a place like this?
I'll tell you what I see.
Sterling Acres.
The latest development miracle from Hamilton Realty.
I see 200 luxury apartments.
Over here, a 24-hour health club right on the grounds.
- State of the art designer interiors.
- This thing is broken.
- The kind of home that you deserve.
- It's not even plugged in.
- That's very smooth, however you did all this.
But you gotta do better than that.
Yeah... you gotta do a lot better than that... to get to me.
Have to do a whole lot better than that to get to me.
Whoever you are.
Don't worry about who I am, Joe.
You won't even remember me tomorrow.
But remember this:
Look at the real price before you close the deal.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.
Listen to your heart.
Do what it tells you.
You'll find your way.
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.
- Where's Joseph and Mary?
Ohhh.
See the infant, meek and mild.
He is God's anointed child.
So celebrate this Christmas morn.
For on this day, His son is born!
Julia.
I wanted to see you to say good-bye.
No, no. I'll call the council and tell them that we still need you.
Well, this is over the council's head.
Way over their head.
Besides, it's time.
How can it be time?
It just is.
It's funny, you know,
I spent the last 30 years... thinking I'd be happy if I could just get back to this place.
Here? The council must send you to some dead neighborhoods.
Well, dead is relative.
But now I know where I belong.
Is this because of me?
No. Mmm.
Well, maybe just a little bit.
You remember when you asked me what you do... when the flame between two people goes out?
Yes.
The answer is:
You don't let it.
Will we ever see you again?
I don't know.
Well, let's see.
No. Not again.
% Or maybe a fisherman%
% Out on the sea%
- How can I thank you?
- You already have.
- God bless you.
- Thank you.
% Who would imagine%
% A king%
% It was so clear%
- Mrs. Biggs, here!
- Jessica, you still have more songs to sing.
I'm wet.
Who would use
Baby Wet Wet for Jesus?
Mrs... Biggs, our Virgin Mary bailed!
People are gonna know that's not in the Bible. Do something!
You better get out there.

Hurry up.
Come on.
- Mommy, was I good?
- Oh! The best donkey.
I'll do it.
- Not bad, man.
Oh, yes!
"Christmas is supposed to be...
"the most joyous day of the year.
Amen!
But for St. Matthew's, today is..."
"For St. Matt's... today is supposed..."
Beloved...
God never promised us a perfect life.
Amen!
He's saving that for the hereafter.
- Oh, no!
- Amen!
While we're here on... on this Earth... there's some things we just got to work for.
- Am I right about this?
- Yeah!
- He's not following the script.
- He's doing fine.
- It could be a job.
- Uh-huh.
- It could be a church.
- Amen!
- It could be a community.
- Amen!
- Could be a marriage.
- Amen!
But the good news is... is that He gave us... two secret weapons to help us to succeed.
- Hope...
- Hope!
- And love.
- And love!
- Hope.
- Hope.
- That's all a prayer is.
- And love.
- Love!
- Loving is giving...
- Yeah!
- Pure and simple.
- Amen!
But in love, there is also forgiveness.
- And forgiveness... belongs to everyone.
- It's a right.
- Yeah!
- Like a right to breathe or eat.
- Yeah!
Or even to fall in love.
Amen!
Sometimes we... we take love for granted.
- Am I right about it?
Those who are nearest to us... dearest to us... those are the ones we forget to cherish.
But the miracle is... when we love someone... we are really loving God.
Look in wonder at those you love... for they are the face of God.
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.
And when the path is dark...
- Amen.
- And the road bends... we will let the Lord show us the way.
- He will give us heart and make us whole.
- Amen!
You see, I know... because He did me!
- Yeah!
- You may ask me, "How?"
How?
You see, He's...
You see,
He's got these angels...
- Yeah.
- Waitin' on this long line... for the chance to come down and help each and every one of us!
- And they do!
- Yes!
So you see, beloved, today I am truly blessed.
- Blessed with hope,
- Hope!
- Blessed with love...
- Love!
And blessed with a belief that I can make a difference!
- All of us can!
We can save this church!
- Yeah!
- He's got a point.
- We will help our poor!
- Oh, yes!
- We will help our young!
- All right!
- And our lonely and our needy!
So now let us begin again.
Let us go forward.
- Forward in hope, forward in love...
- Hope! Love!
And forward into the new days of our lives!
Put your hands together and praise God!
- Whoo!
Praise Him! Hallelujah!

Member? I'm planning on getting married in this church.
- To who?
- Who do you think?
- You're my little lamb dumpling.
- We're gonna have a daddy?
- Did he say "lamb dumpling"?
I can't believe you said that to the pastor.
Oh, well, the pastor's gonna have to get himself a new secretary.
- I'm gonna have to pray on that.
- Joe, Merry Christmas.
You belong here, Henry. Call me Monday.
We'll work that mortgage thing out.
That's wonderful.
- Call me.
- I will.
Henry, you did it!
No, honey, we did.
- Good sermon, Reverend.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- Who's that?
- I don't know.
Maybe he's new in the neighborhood.
Come on, boys!
Let's go!
Hey, Merry Christmas, Dudley.
Merry Christmas to you, too, Jeremiah.
Lunch and presents. Come on, boys!
Jeremiah, give me your hand, honey.
Mom, did you get Dudley a present?
Jeremiah, who is Dudley, baby?
- Ma, you know Dudley.
- Come on, boys, let's go get some soup.
That was a long time ago. At least a year.
Before Hakim came to live with us for good.
Wow!
And became my real brother.
It's beautiful!
You must've sat up with that all night, baby.
- Mama, you didn't.
- With my back?
My parents still think I made Dudley up.
They say,
"If he's so real, then where is he?"
But just like I told Daddy... just because you can't see the air... doesn't stop you from breathing.
And just 'cause you can't see God... it don't stop you from believing.
Then Daddy smiled and said...
"Son, that's what we call faith."

I'll get my pliers and yank it out.

Honey, you just don't know these people.
It isn't good to be late to an audition.
Whoa!
JERI: Oliver!
Don't ask. I don't want to bore you with it.
Kids, stay here and watch Duchess.
-Where's my music?
-CHARLIE: It's in your hand, Dad.
Can't we watch you audition?
Yeah. No, no, makes me too nervous.
You know, you're incredibly late.
Look, since when is six minutes incredibly late, huh?
For Lord Richard, it is.
RICHARD: No.
-Manny?
-Yeah.
Where's Tony Sable?
He'll be here any minute, but we gotta see this Oliver Greening first.
Why? Who's he?
He's nobody, but the threat of several other actors gets us bargaining leverage with Sable's agent.
Now, Mr. Greening,
I see you've come in costume.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes, lucky accident.
Not that lucky.
Performer of my stature having to audition is insulting.
Tony, if it were anyone other than Lord Richard, I'd never allow it.
Besides, there are only a few candidates.
-Who's scheduled ahead of me?
-Oliver Greening.
You can park your limo here if you watch my horse.
-Gee, thanks.
-My pleasure.
-But Dad said...
-Dad said to watch Duchess.
So, she's being watched, right? Come on.
You haven't mentioned how you feel about my score.
Oh, yes. It's quite possibly the finest work that you have ever produced.
Without a doubt.
-Without a doubt.
-Lovely and haunting.
Intimate, yet operatic.
Presently about to start.
Let's have a crack at it, shall we?
What the devil's going on up there?
Quiet!
Proceed.
(SINGING) The rats come creeping out
I know something you don't know.
When he doesn't get the part, and he won't, we're moving to North Platte to live with an Uncle Carl.
North Platte, it's a city in Nebraska.
You're lying.
No, I heard Dad on the phone. Uncle Carl offered him a job at his rendering plant.
What's that?
That's a place where they take all the parts of a dead animal that nobody wants, then melt them down in a big pot to make stuff like glue and guitar picks.
That's disgusting.
Fine, fine! No real challenge there.
Let me hear the big one.
Off to the Gallows.
(SINGING) Shed not one tear
My dearest Lucie
l must die soon
in one swift moment
The blade will fall then
My head he'll chop off
Please, turn away then
Don't see it drop off
'Tis a far, far better thing that l do now
Than Iâve ever done before
Have no illusion
Itâs the solution
Itâs a far, far better thing that l do now
Than Iâve ever done before
You were confusingly good.
Excuse me?
-You're excused. Tony Sable's here.
-Ah...
Why can't we consider this Greening chap?
No, no, no.
You promised your backers a named star.
We'll call you.
Charlie, do they have a lot of theaters in Nebraska?
I don't think they have a lot of anything in Nebraska.
Except maybe Nebraskans.
Charlie, do you believe in fairy godmothers?
I hate to break it to you, Anabel, but there is no fairy godmothers.
There's no tooth fairy, there's no angels, there's no genie in the bottle, there's no Wizard of Oz.
It's all a big bunch of bull.
You're wrong, and I can prove it.
Yeah, well, go ahead.
If there's no tooth fairy, then explain this?
You think you know everything, but you don't.
I know this much, there are no fairy godmothers in Manhattan.
How would you know?
WOMAN 1 : Watch your wand. Watch the lady.
WOMAN 2: All these fairy godmothers getting together, it's so wonderful.
WOMAN 3: Every fairy godmother in Manhattan meet once a year.
Wish it were more.
Be sure and check your wands, girls.
Thank you for signing in.
Elevator's right over there.
Welcome, welcome.
Are all the districts accounted for?
Well, all but one of course.
How distressing. Well, come along, ladies.
Violet, I haven't seen you since last year's retreat.
Hello. We're ready for 24 hours of fun.
It's hard to believe another year's gone by.
Why do we have to check our wands?
Really, I feel naked without mine.
Well, it's like in the Old West.
All the cowpokes had to check their guns before they moseyed into town.
Especially in Dodge City.
And that's why nobody got plugged.
Well, all it takes is one show off.
Well, that pair from Rego Park, remember?
(SCOFFS) They got way out of control.
Mmm-hmm. I had to put them both on suspension for six months.
ANABEL: That's what I need, a fairy godmother.
Are you a fairy godmother?
Can't you tell?
Ta-da!
You don't look a whole lot like the one in Cinderella.
I don't? I know why, because I'm...
You mean because I'm so much taller.
Ah, well, listen, you know...
It's not the height.
The hair.
Because hers is gray and mine is red.
I don't think it's the hair.
Oh! You... You mean the whole guy thing.
Yes, well, no, she's not a fella. That's true.
Can I ask you something?
What difference does it really make where the magic comes from?
I mean, isn't the real question, can the person do the job?
-Can you?
-What?
Can you do the job?
Boy, this is some swell room, huh?
Well, missy, look at all the...
What luck, a Buddy Rich enthusiast.
Thank you.
Is something the matter?
Are you nervous or something?
Not at all. Not me.
What's your name?
That's... I'm sorry...
That's the first thing you learn, you know, is...
Hello, there. My name is Murray.
Can I talk to you about my wish?
Your wish? Anxious to get to that.
Boy, it's dry here, isn't it?
You wouldn't have a thirst quencher handy, would you?
Um...
How about milk and cookies?
No, I'm... What, do I look like Santa?
No, I don't drink milk.
However, if you did happen to have a steamy, hot espresso or coffee.
As long as it's caffeinated, gotta be caffeinated.
Can't you just wave around your wand to make yourself coffee whenever you want?
You do that, and it's over.
They just strip you of your wand and... Shaboom!
Fini.
So, who's the joker in the jammies?
It's my brother, Charlie.
He thinks fairy godmothers don't exist.
Maybe he might reconsider if we turn him into a frog, huh?
You can do that?
That happens to be one of my best things.
You know, back in basic training frogs was my signature spell.
-Frogs and rain, interestingly enough.
-Do it.
What? Turn Charlie into a frog?
Well... Yeah, well, that's what I like.
Nice, clean, simple wish.
Here we go.
Wait, wait.
How many wishes do I have?
Oh! One per customer.
And no wishing for more wishes, you sneaky little devil.
Because, you know, they plugged that loophole up years ago.
There was abuse.
All right!
-Wait, stop.
-What?
I've a better wish.
It's for my dad.
Ah, that's sweet.
What day is it?
-Wednesday.
-Wednesday.
Oh, okay, I gotta go.
I'll have to give you a rain check, okay.
Okay. But what's a rain check?
Rain check is, well, you know...
Like, in a baseball game, when it rains, you get a new game.
Oh, I can't believe this.
Every fairy godmother in the city is uptown with the exception of me.
But my wish can't wait.
It's very important.
-Pretend you're sleeping, okay?
-All right.
Claudia.
No, you really shouldn't be here.
You can't be...
Now, how can you say that I can't be here when I already am.
-It's just not logical.
-No, no, no, I...
Well, this is my faithful companion, Boots.
You know, Claudia, since you left us, rumor has it that you've gone into the dark side.
Witch. Moi?
Oh, you can't be serious.
Do I look like a witch?
Well, you know, you really should leave.
Because if Hortense were to see you here,
I could lose my own wand.
Oh, no one knows the pain of such a loss more than I.
So, I'll go.
But before I do, I remembered what a healthy appetite you have, so I brought you a little something from my garden.
No thanks, I just had quite a bit of...
My, that is the reddest apple
I think I've ever seen.
-It tastes even better than it looks.
-Really?
Yummy!
Mmm.
Now, is that the apple of a witch?
Mmm-mmm.
You bet it is.
Let's get the wands.
All right, take the work area,
I'm going to search her desk.
BOOTS: Right, right, right.
What is with you?
I've got to pee.
But you were just outside.
I always lose it when I get nervous.
What good are you? Now, move it.
I think I liked you better when you were a dog.
All right, Rena, honey.
What the...
Claudia!
What are you doing here?
Taking back what's mine.
I took your wand away because you were using it for your own selfish ends.
That is not what fairy godmothers are all about!
No, you're all about 70.
Get out of my house.
Or what?
Don't even think about it.
As a person,
I always found you a tad one-dimensional.
You're making a big mistake.
What's that? Speak up.
That ought to hold her for about 24 hours.
And by then, any wish worth a damn will be mine.
Hortense, what happened to you?
Would you remind me to call Alphonse and get a refund on those apples.
Now, nothing is wrong.
Nothing is wrong?
No, everything is perfectly normal.
Hortense is flat.
Perfectly normal. Hortense is flat.
All is right.
Phew.
Party on, ladies. Enjoy your day off.
You stay right where you are.
Why aren't you asleep?
My fairy godmother came to see me tonight.
You don't say.
And was she nice?
Yeah, but it wasn't a she.
It was a guy named Murray.
Ah.
He left this.
-I'm not sure how it works.
-The old magic wand, huh?
Yeah, magic.
But he had to go away before I could even tell him my wish.
I bet you that if you went to sleep, this Murray would come back with an instruction book.
Nice try, Dad, but I'm not a bit sleepy.
Shaboom!
There, I put a spell on you.
-To help you get the part.
-Come on.
It's late. Time to go to bed.
Dad, remember how you said
Mommy went to heaven?
-How she's an angel now.
-Mmm-hmm.
Were you making that up?
Why do you ask that question?
Charlie said that it was bull.
I mean, Charlie said that it wasn't true.
Well, I believe that.
I know that she's in heaven.
You know, but I also think that there's a big part of her that's right here.
Where?
No. I mean, I see her when I look at you.
You know, she had that way of looking at the world, right in the face.
Did she ever give up?
No.
Dad, will you do my hair?
I'll tell you what.
First thing in the morning, okay?
I'm stuck, very stuck.
Well, if it isn't one of our city's finest.
Hello, Officer.
What the hell are you?
You see that plaque? NAFGA.
NAFGA.
North American
Fairy Godmothers' Association.
Let me ask you something, Fairy Godmother.
Where is your wand?
Oh!
Well, it's right...
I'm in big trouble.
Oh, you are in trouble.
You see, I could arrest you for a lot of things.
That would require a lot of paperwork, and a lot of my time.
And they'd probably call me down somewhere to testify.
On my day off.
And I imagine that would be your day at the gym.
And then knowing the system the way I do, you probably wouldn't do even one night behind bars.
But tonight, tonight you will.
Fairy godmother. My...
Officer, where are you going?
Are you off to get a donut?
ANABEL: Not so tight.
-Ow! Not so tight, Dad.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sugar.
I'm always gonna be a klutz at this. Done.
-Charlie, me boy, let's go.
-What's that?
-You better be nice to me.
-(SCOFFS)
Why would you bring something like that to school?
It's none of your business, Charlie.
-CHARLIE: Shut up!
-It's your fault, you started it.
Just tell her to shut up.
-Dad, he did start it.
-No, I heard you.
Dad.
-Charlie.
-Oh, hey, Jeri.
I was gonna call, but I figured
I better break this to you in person.
I know. He's too tall, he's too short.
He's too young, he's too old.
I did not get the part.
No, you didn't.
But they wanna hear you sing again.
-You're kidding.
-Mmm-mmm.
-Tonight, 9:30. No.
-You're not kidding.
Oliver, you're about this close to getting it.
-Call me a cab.
-All right, you're a cab.
-Go.
-Going, going.
-Wow, maybe it's working.
-What's working?
Uh, nothing.
ANABEL: I'm sure they sent us ahead just so they could kiss and make out.
CHARLIE: Duh.
Taxi!
-Can I see it?
-No. Listen...
Come on, let me see it.
-Okay, but be careful.
-Oh, please!
Okay, so I'll see you tonight.
You know, you're the first agent that I ever kissed and dug it.
Give me back my wand.
-Give me back my wand.
-I got the wand now.
-I'll see you tonight.
-All right.
Come on. Come on.
Whoa!
Okay, Mr. Kim. Are you okay?
ANABEL: Where'd it go?
I hate you.
All, right, Mr. Kim, we're gonna pick...
He's gonna pick it up.
Dad, it's so stupid. She thinks it's magic.
OLIVER: Why can't you just play along?
She's just a kid.
Some people's taste.
I thought I felt a flea.
Go. Sit.
Now what?
I really admire you.
Yeah, I got that. Now, go sit.
Where was I?
I don't understand, why do we need all these wands?
I mean, with all your power?
It isn't enough just to control the power of dark magic.
To be truly effective and monstrously evil, one needs to control the power of white magic as well.
Now, see, every living soul in this city has some desperate wish, some secret desire they think will improve their miserable little lives.
Why, all these goody-goody sticks off the street, they'll have to come to me.
Where was I?
One-ninety-one, 1 92,
-1 93, 1 94. Boots!
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
Put that down.
I don't see it.
One-ninety-seven, 1 98, 1 99.
It's not here. We're short one wand.
And the wand that is missing is the one I want the most. Mine!
BOOTS: There isn't anything in here.
CLAUDIA: Seventeenth district, east side.
My old stomping grounds before Hortense stripped me of my wand.
Maybe we could go there and sniff it out.
(SCOFFS) Haven't been in broad daylight for years!
Oh!
I love this mirror.
Rights, Boots, get changed.
We're going for a very important walk.
You haven't put any glue on that, and that's got far too much.
Move over your paper.
Everybody, your napkin holders must be finished today.
Get going, it's beyond improvement.
Begin again.
Lacking talent, lacking inspiration, lacking everything.
A waste of glue.
What's this?
It's something I have to fix.
-It's not our assignment. Hand over your toy.
-ANABEL: It's not a toy.
It's a magic wand.
Of course! Now, give that to me.
I wish you'd let me have it.
Shaboom!
MS. BRAMBLE: Children, stop laughing.
Jeffrey, what are you doing over there?
Anabel. Anabel!
Anabel!
Oh, thank goodness!
Murray, where'd you go?
Well, it's a long story involving the police, fire department and the jaws of life.
Uh, listen, the other night, I left a long...
You know, a wand...
Oh, no. This is sad. This is...
Sticky? Why is it sticky?
I tried gluing it back together.
You put glue on my wand?
You don't put glue on someone's wand.
This is like the Army. You're given one, it's supposed to last forever.
Look at this. I can't get my hand off.
Here, I have an idea.
This'll keep the pieces together until the glue dries.
Done.
Does this mean I don't get my wish?
Huh?
Oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly.
Of course you'll get your...
Well, I'll do the best I can.
MS. BRAMBLE: Anabel?
Follow me.
About this wish, the future of my entire family depends on it.
Well, at least there's no pressure. Okay, so, whatever your wish is, just remember, keep it simple.
ANABEL: Okay, here's the thing.
My dad, you see, he's got to sing tonight, and if he does it better than anyone else in the world, he'll get this part and we won't have to move to Nebraska, and work for Uncle Carl and render things.
Uh-huh.
Charlie says they make plastic dishes out of puppy dog tails.
Anabel, please, simple.
Okay, I wish that when my dad sings tonight, he gets the part.
You mean, that's all?
Well, for heaven's sakes, think of it as done.
Come on.
So, you can do it?
What? Yes, but not here.
See, the granter of the wish, namely me, has to be within 1 00 yards of the beneficiary, which is your father.
So, where is your father?
Um...
Right across from The Plaza Hotel. Come on, the subway's one block out the front door.
Subway? Are you kidding?
Have wand, will travel.
Murray, what are you talking about?
Well, it's not important. Come on.
So, Anabel, I want you to look in my eyes and get a fix on the place you want to be.
-Let me see that.
-No, no.
Not yours, is it?
Am I using up my wish?
This is in service of your main wish, so try and see it in your head.
See The Plaza Hotel. Visualize it.
Visualize.
(STUTTERING) Shaboom!
Anabel!
Anabel!
Something tells me we're not in Manhattan anymore.
Ouch!
Murray?
Tell me when the coffee's ready.
Oh, Murray.
You wouldn't have any floss on you, would you?
Just get up.
I guess I missed the off ramp, huh?
I'd say definitely.
MURRAY: Nebraska.
We're in Nebraska.
What about that other sign?
What does it say?
MURRAY: It says, "The Plaza Motel."
"The Plaza Motel."
Murray, this is not my wish.
Yes. No. I'm aware of that, dear.
Look, I was coming down the hallway and I was trying to follow this girl.
She was going away and I... Look, I...
CHARLIE: What's going on? What happened?
Ms. Bramble went mental.
Hey, has anyone seen Anabel?
She ran away.
This isn't like her.
Yeah, and she took her magic wand.
MS. BRAMBLE: ...I don't know, and the girl flew away.
Let me see. Good.
I knew it, I knew it. I knew my nose would lead us right to the place.
Ah. Boots, you amaze me.
We've grilled 29 out of 30 kids.
There's only one left, you dithering little idiot.
Anabel, honey, let me ask you something.
Can I?
Remember when I told you to get a mental picture in your head?
Remember that?
Do you think you had anything else going on in there?
Other than The Plaza Hotel? I mean...
Do you think it's possible that you could have been thinking of, let's say, I don't know, Nebraska?
Well, maybe. A little. I guess so.
Ah!
Are you saying this is my fault?
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, honey, no.
Not at all. Don't be...
Well, not entirely your fault.
But then again,
I guess it wasn't entirely my fault, was it?
Oh, you're unbelievable.
Can't you even admit it?
Admit what?
That you blew it.
You totally screwed my wish.
-I did not blow it.
-You did too.
-Did not.
-Did too.
-Did not.
-Did too to infinity.
Did not to double infinity.
There is no such thing.
-There isn't?
-Mmm-mmm.
Hey, Joe, did you see my sister?
Uh-uh. Everything all right?
Yeah, yeah. How about my dad? Where is he?
He took off a while ago with a bunch of tourists.
-Come on, let's go track the old man down.
-No, thanks, man. This'll be faster.
What a dump.
This had better not be a wild goose chase.
Somewhere in here I smell the wand.
-I got her. I found her. She's here!
-She's here!
Look.
This is a snapshot.
-She's a ballerina. Isn't that cute?
-"Cute."
They are the worst. Honestly, those children, how I used to hate listening to their insipid little wishes as if I had nothing better to do with the rest of my life!
Cinderella.
Oh, God. How I despise this book.
Nothing in this book has ever made any sense whatsoever.
I mean, what kind of masochistic idiot goes to a ball wearing glass shoes?
JERI: Oliver? Kids?
Wherever you are, I hope you get this.
Your callback audition's still on for tonight,
9:30, Palace Ð¢heater.
Boots, how would you like to get all dressed up and go to The Palace?
ANABEL: Murray, do you think anybody lives at that motel?
MURRAY: No, dear. If you recall, the Clampetts struck oil and then moved to Beverly Hills. Remember that?
Look, a payphone!
Maybe we can call my dad.
I don't know. It doesn't... No, it's broken.
How many days did you say till your dad's big audition?
Not days. He's got to sing at 9:30 tonight.
Murray.
You're on my property!
-Greetings.
-Now stop right there!
Oh!
How elegant.
My name is Murray and this is Anabel.
And, you must be...
Oh! "Roy."
Hey, Anabel, honey, say hello to Roy.
It ain't Roy!
But it says on his shirt.
It ain't my shirt!
That ain't his shirt, honey.
Oh! How very artistic.
-"Duane."
-So, who's Roy?
Got a brother Roy!
Is that his shirt?
Was.
Roy's dead.
I needed a clean shirt.
(SOFTLY) He killed his brother
'cause he needed a clean shirt?
Well, this is Nebraska.
So, we have got to go. Love to stay.
But gotta go, so say goodbye to primitive man, dear.
Not so fast!
What's that?
It's a magic wand, a real one. And it's got a lot more power than your stupid shotgun.
Honey. She's just a child and doesn't seem to understand the danger of combining a deadly weapon and a low IQ.
Let me see that a minute!
Mmm?
-Give me that thing just a second now.
-Wanna see what?
Speak English.
Give me that divining rod right now.
Let me see that divining rod a second.
Sure. Yes.
MURRAY: Just a stick.
Let that go! Come on, already.
I'll hang on to this.
Now you just listen up, you good old boy.
Now you get those greasy taters out of your ears so you listen real good.
Good Lord, that is disgusting!
Take that back.
Can you believe him?
You may think that's an old popsicle stick, but that's powerful magic in there, fella.
-Oh, Roy.
-Hey!
Stop right there!
What you going to do? Wave it around, turn me into some little bunny rabbit?
Do it, Murray. Turn him into a little rabbit.
Well, take your best shot. And I'll take mine.
(STUTTERING) Shaboom!
MURRAY: He's not exactly little.
No, not quite a rabbit, either.
Something's not kosher and I think it's Duane.
Murray.
Rabbit, rabbi, it's in the same ballpark.
Do you realize if he spits now, we're goners.
Let's go.
MURRAY: Get a clear picture in your head, where do you want to go?
-Central Park and hurry!
-Close your eyes!
Oh, just do it already!
Shaboom!
Excuse me, Anabel, dear, but what exactly were you thinking?
ANABEL: It's my favorite part of Central Park.
No, thanks! Already ate!
Come on, we've got to go find Dad.
-All right. Well, The Plaza Hotel is that way.
-That way.
Have you seen my dad?
No.
Have you seen my dad?
Sorry.
Anabel, you just missed Charlie.
He's been looking to find you.
I told him where your dad was.
This is my fairy...
Fairly new friend. We just met.
How are you doing? Good to see you.
Need a lift to your dad? Hop in.
Closer to the horse. That's right.
She likes you.
Don't you, Duchess?
MURRAY: Okay, driver, this is good.
ANABEL: It's good, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Joe, this is good.
You sure? Happy to take you around.
We're going to surprise him.
MURRAY: Okay, let's do this!
Okay, Anabel, you gotta help me here.
Which one is your dad?
ANABEL: He's the one with the brown coat and the big hat.
Okay, close your eyes and just visualize your wish coming true and just...
That's good. Visualize.
(STUTTERING) Shaboom!
What the...
My hat! Hey, grab my hat!
Oh!
Dad? Dad!
Anabel, where have you been?
Here, lose something?
When Dad finds out about what you did, you're going to be in some...
Hey, mister, sorry.
We don't got any spare change, so just take a hike, all right.
Just leave us alone.
Anabel, honey.
-You see, Dad...
-CHARLIE: Anabel, who's this bum?
And what's he doing with your magic wand?
It's not my wand, Charlie. It's his.
And I am not a bum, thank you.
Do you want to tell him or should I?
-Tell me what?
-This is Murray, he's my fairy godmother.
Male fairy godmother.
Anabel, what's going on here?
Where's Dad and Duchess?
-They were just here, right?
-I'm not sure about Duchess, but Dad's...
Where? I don't see him.
That's Dad.
CHARLIE: No, that's a statue.
That doesn't even look like Dad.
Well, trust me. It is. I saw Murray use magic.
-WOMAN: It's a mouse!
-I hate mice!
ANABEL: Hey, wait. That's not a mouse.
It's Duchess.
Come on. Come on, Duchess. Come on.
CHARLIE: What did this fairy godmother guy do to you?
I agree, but twice in one century is excessive,
I think.
Come on. Good girl. Good girl, Duchess.
You know, that mouse might very well be a horse.
-I'm sorry. I don't speak English.
-CHARLIE: I'm putting the horse in your bag.
Ah.
Yes, that's good. I write you later.
All right, I think I got it.
You're supposed to be 1 00 yards.
That's definitely more than 1 00 yards, so you have to be within 1 00 yards.
I think I was just too far.
I was blaming it on the wand.
This is going to be fine, okay.
Now, look at this. Ready?
(STUTTERING) Shaboom!
Oh.
CHARLIE: All right, all right. Enough.
Where is Dad? And who is this nut?
-Nut.
-Charlie, let me have a minute.
I liked him better when he was asleep.
There's a pushy quality when he's awake that doesn't quite work.
This is a mess.
I know. It's not good.
You really are a fairy godmother, aren't you?
Oh, yeah. Yes. Absolutely.
Then undo it. Undo the spell.
You mean spell reversal?
It can be done, can't it?
I've never done it.
How long have you been at this?
I'm certified, if that's what you're getting at.
And I did very well on the final exams.
I skipped over some of the true-or-false questions, which, in retrospect, is really dumb because if you just guess at it, for heaven's sake, you can...
We what? Fifty-fifty chance you know what you're doing.
How long?
Well, between you and me, this wish of yours would be my first one solo.
This stinks!
I know. It's bad. It isn't good, but we're dealing with it, remember?
And, nothing's cast in stone.
Well, with the exception of your father.
Bronze. And that statue, Anabel,
-I'm telling you...
-Go over here.
That is not Dad. I know.
It is, too.
-It is not.
-Guys, guys, trust me.
Hortense will straighten this out.
The woman has an answer for everything.
This even the right address?
-Trust me. This is the right address.
-Someone could get in there.
Don't look at me.
I try to keep the jaws of life experience down to once a week.
-Someone give me a boost.
-This is crazy.
-We're insane. We are all...
-What?
Oh! What an excellent idea. My, you're clever.
Here, let me. Okay.
CHARLIE: Careful, you don't want that horse in your bag to have an accident on your homework.
-Very funny.
-(DUCHESS SQUEAKS)
It's okay, Duchess. Stick with me.
Attagirl! Now, listen, if anyone asks, just say you're a friend of Murray's.
Yeah, that ought to carry a lot of weight.
Hello, in there.
Yoo-hoo!
Oh.
Yo, fairy?
Yeah, that's Mr. Fairy to you.
Did you think of trying the handle?
Yo, Anabel. Remember us? Come on.
Get away from me. Go away.
Finally, the fairy godmother headquarters.
What took you so long?
Murray, is this house haunted?
Not very. No.
I heard breathing and I don't think it was her or me.
Hortense?
Wait, wait, wait. This playing card.
-You're telling me this is a person?
-MURRAY: That's her, all right.
She's the queen of the fairy godmothers.
Fairy di tutti fairies.
Hortense, it's Murray.
A spell like this...
No fairy godmother would ever do a spell like this.
This is the dark stuff. This is witchcraft.
Now, don't be afraid. I'm here.
It's going to be okay.
Hopefully.
Nice and easy. She's very fragile.
Well, I'm assuming she's fragile.
The only thing missing is the syrup at this point.
I'm sorry. I just...
This joke's fallen a little flat. There.
That's right.
Okay, just give me a hand here to...
Not literally. No, I mean, just...
That's right. That's very nice.
Okay, so looks like the wand will have to save the day once again.
All right. Okay, so this is 50 feet.
Wish me luck.
(STUTTERING) Shaboom!
Hello, Murray.
Why, Rena.
What a pleasant surprise.
You said you'd call me.
-Well things got busy. Yes?
-Murray? Murray?
-Is she your girlfriend?
-No, no, no. She's not...
Hey, Anabel, check it out.
He's got a girlfriend.
-She is not my girlfriend.
-Then who is she?
I was really very disappointed...
Yeah, can we possibly discuss this...
HORTENSE: All of you, pay attention!
We've got a crisis on our hands.
Little girl, who are you?
Um, hi, my name is Anabel.
This is my brother, Charlie.
And we came here
'cause Murray thought you could help.
You see, he's trying to grant me a wish and...
And nothing really. It's just...
You know how it happens.
The spell went ever so slightly awry.
CHARLIE: Yes, ever so slightly wrong.
Goodness, Murray.
What have you been doing with our wand?
Get to work, Rena.
For what we're up against, it's going to need a quick fix.
I'm sorry. "For what we're up against."
What would that mean, dear?
Come with me, pumpkin.
Okay, now that's heavy.
-Charlie, would you maybe help us...
-Pumpkin.
-I'm very comfortable...
-Would you just give us a hand, please?
Are you really the head of all the fairy godmothers?
I am, yes.
I tried to keep my wish simple...
There's no such thing as a simple wish.
Just put those goggles on, would you, boys?
Cute.
So, tell me about your wish.
My dad got turned into a statue and I don't know why.
Was there anything else?
His horse got turned into a mouse, and his carriage got turned into a pumpkin.
HORTENSE: Stop right there.
This spell of Murray's, it must be lifted before midnight.
After that, your father will most likely remain a statue forever.
You promised her what?
Nothing, I just said that we'd get the wands back.
From Claudia's? No, no. Forget it.
Absolutely not.
Murray, we've got to.
We've got to get to the park before midnight, otherwise Dad will be a statue forever.
Look, there has got to be some sort of...
Oh!
Anabel, honey, listen, we cannot go to Claudia's. I mean, first of all,
I don't even know where she lives.
And secondly, she hates my guts.
Is this another one of your ex-girlfriends?
Look, let's just try to stick to the topic, shall we?
-If Dad misses his audition...
-CHARLIE: If? Anabel, it's 9:1 5, game over, that's it.
Listen, now, let me tell you something.
It ain't over until the flat lady sings.
Get it?
"Flat" lady, "fat" lady?
-Don't worry about it. It's just...
-Murray, remember last night when you told me that I had to take a rain check?
Okay, go backstage, find your dad's agent and tell him to stall, okay?
-CHARLIE: Yeah, okay.
-You gotta get us to the balcony.
ANABEL: Follow me.
Charlie, thank God.
-Where's your dad?
-He just got a little stuck.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you now Mr. Tony Sable,
who, with your generous backing, will be the star of my 23rd consecutive hit.
-That's the guy, right?
-TONY: Thank you, Lord Richard.
-What are you going to do?
-Maestro.
Time for that rain check.
(SINGING) Shed not one tear
My dearest Lucie
I must die soon
In one swift moment
Shaboom!
What is going on here?
How am I expected to work...
Now, that's what I call rain.
-Anabel, did you see that?
-Yes!
RICHARD: The thunderstorm isn't until Act 2.
Yes, yes, I did it.
Manny, move.
Seriously, what's going on here?
-Manny?
-What do you want with me?
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had a new sprinkler system installed and there are some bugs left to work out.
RICHARD: My soggiest apologies.
After all, the show must go on.
-All right, Mr. Sable. The stage is yours.
-ANABEL: That's it?
-All right, Mr. Sable. The stage is yours.
-ANABEL: That's it?
That guy gets to sing and my dad can't?
It's so unfair.
Interesting.
-Did I say something?
-(TONY SINGING)
You ever get that feeling where you feel a sore throat coming on?
Sort of (GASPS) scratchy?
You mean like a frog in your throat?
Hurry, he's already singing.
(STUTTERING) Shaboom!
Anything for attention.
Tony? Tony?
Tony?
Now, that is what I call a frog.
Not so fast. Get that back to that keyboard.
If you ever want to work here or anywhere else, play.
Now, there's no need for concern, ladies and gentlemen.
No, no. Keep your seats.
Keep your seats, please.
Anabel? Murray?
There, there. Don't go.
They're perfectly harmless.
What's a few toads when
Broadway history's about to be made?
MAN: Look, Richard, I love the show.
I love the set, I love the T-shirts,
I love everything!
If you just add a six-foot frog, I'm in.
Well, that's what I get for getting over excited.
My, oh, my.
Hey, I'm fine. I don't need a doctor.
I need a microphone.
I'm okay. Listen.
(SINGING) Itâs a far, far better thing that l do
Do you see any frogs in there? Look.
Save it for opening night, Tony.
-You mean I got the part?
-Yeah.
Wait a minute. Manny, listen to me...
-He wins by default.
-But, Manny...
Sorry, toots. That's show business.
Murray, that was great. I wish I could...
-I mean, I...
-I think I know.
Murray, when I grow up,
I think I want to be a fairy godmother.
You want to take a crack at it. Is that it?
I really shouldn't, but there you go.
Do I hold it like this?
No, it's more like...
No, no, no. It's more like with two...
See, it's...
-Where'd it go?
-I...
ANABEL: Where is it?
MURRAY: This is a serious problem.
Oh, this is sad.
-Got you now.
-Boots!
Back off, Murray. I'll push her over. I will.
Dead giveaway, Murray.
Any magic around here had to come from you.
Come on. Let her go.
-Where's Claudia's wand?
-(MUFFLED) I don't know.
Ah!
Did your dad ever tell you the story of Brer Rabbit?
I know it.
Please, don't throw me in the briar patch.
Yes. Yes, that's it. That's good.
-I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse.
-No!
MURRAY: Boots, you don't scare us.
Maybe Claudia could, but not you.
Claudia?
Please, don't take us to Claudia's.
Oh, please, don't!
BOOTS: You know what?
I'm gonna take you to Claudia's.
To Claudia's?
No!
Isn't it frightening, waiting to see if we're going to Claudia's?
Come on, we're going to Claudia's.
Oh, Lordy! No.
What's to become of us?
Will we survive?
MURRAY: Despair is my new middle name.
Woe is me!
The end is near.
Duchess, hey, hey.
Come here, come here. Stay.
Gotcha.
MURRAY: Save us!
Woe is me!
Whatever you do, don't show us where the wands are hidden.
MURRAY: Yes, don't do that.
CLAUDIA: Nothing.
Poochcas, I send you out to fetch me one measly little wand, and you failed to do even that. Did you not?
(WHISPERS) To get to the wands!
-What?
-I...
What was that?
Care to share it with the rest of the class?
Boots!
Guard.
Princess,
-come look me in the eye.
-Don't.
My wand. You know where it is, don't you?
MURRAY: Don't talk to her.
Don't even look at her.
Now, surely you have a wish.
Every creature your age, any turning of the head, gives birth to a new longing.
Very well.
If need be,
I will do the choosing.
This child wishes...
To be a great dancer.
Bingo!
Claudia, don't.
Murray, please help. I don't wanna dance.
I can't stop.
Oh, yes, you can.
Just as soon as you come clean about where in this wretched city you stashed my wand.
MURRAY: Come on, Claudia.
This is so demented.
CLAUDIA: What's wrong with this picture?
Something's off.
Dancing all alone, doesn't seem like much fun.
BOOTS: Claudia, we can't leave them dancing forever.
Oh, they won't last long.
-BOOTS: Make your bet.
-Murray, please make her stop.
CLAUDIA: The only question is which one will break first.
My money's on the midget.
And we have a fabulous conductor.
-Help me, Murray.
-Help you?
Help me!
Put me down!
-Help!
-MURRAY: Get down!
No! No! No!
Please...
Put him down.
ANABEL: I give up!
I'll tell everything you wanna know.
I give up! I give up! I give up.
I'll tell everything.
Anabel! Don't!
I believe we have a winner!
Oh, you poor darling, come with me into the parlor.
I'll take care of all your wishes.
You, stay with twinkle toes.
If he makes a move towards those wands, give him a taste of the mace.
Now, my darling, you must be exhausted.
Can I get you some brandy? A milk?
Both?
Now, just between us girls,
-where's my wand?
-Central Park.
-Near the boat lake.
-CLAUDIA: The precise location?
If I take you, you'll show me, won't you?
Yes, but there's something I want in return.
There's always something.
What? Do you want to go home?
No, but it was very sweet to think of it.
Sweet. That's me.
So, then what is your wish...
Your request?
I want you to use your incredible powers to release my father from a magic spell that Murray totally screwed up.
CLAUDIA: Classic, isn't it?
Well, that's what happens when you send a man to do a woman's job.
Wait till you hear the details.
-You won't believe the things he did.
-CLAUDIA: Tell me all.
ANABEL: Well, he took us to Nebraska...
MURRAY: It was worth a try.
BOOTS: You can't fool me,
I'm gonna be a witch.
Listen, Bootsie,
I've known many witches in my day, and you're no witch.
Claudia promised me.
You believed her?
You poor, gullible mutt, she's lying to you!
She'd never lie to me. She's my friend.
(WHISPERS) She can't keep a promise to anyone other than herself.
Go ahead, see for yourself.
Ow!
What?
MURRAY: I guess the cleaning lady didn't show up this week, huh?
Boots?
Boots?
-You were supposed to be watching him.
-I... I, I...
-Bad dog. Bad, bad dog.
-(BOOTS WHINING)
CLAUDIA: Now do as I told you.
Get over there and drag that chest of wands over to the fire and burn them. Go on.
Murray!
-You weren't thinking of leaving, were you?
-Oh, no.
I thought we were having so much fun.
-We are.
-Yeah.
You know, you really needn't worry about being such a miserable failure as a fairy godmother.
Actually, I'm planning on phasing all of you out anyway.
"Actually I'm planning on phasing all of you out anyway."
How dare you mock me!
"How dare you mock me!"
Cut it out!
"Cut it..." (CHOKING)
Listen, buster, you are talking to the future queen of darkness here.
You don't seem so confident about that.
-Look at those worry lines.
-(GASPS)
Liar.
You know, normally, I enjoy liars.
But in your case,
I believe I will have to make an exception.
I'm not lying.
Right next to that wart that's growing.
Wart?
I have a lighter, if you'd like to burn it off, sweetie.
Murray, I'm just about ready to break every bone in your body.
"Murray, I'm just about ready to break every bone in your..."
What's that?
Feeling a little al dente today, are we?
Oh, no. No, Murray, don't.
You'll smudge my wax.
Men.
They'll always be putty in my hands.
I'd love you to tell me where you hid my wand!
(SIGHS) Now is the time for all good men to spill the beans.
Aw. Look at the poor little fairy godmother.
Think you're so magical, do you?
-Wait, wait. Here, burn this.
-What?
Go ahead.
-You're getting rid of it?
-Could be.
But it's a perfectly good old shoe.
-I love old shoes.
-Sit.
ANABEL: Good girl. Stay.
CLAUDIA: Great, what now?
And you, what an annoying yet undeniably cunning child.
Yes.
Still has its old snap.
Olly, olly, oxen free!
Come on, both of you move.
Come on.
Tired of this game.
All the time, all the planning, all the magic that went into making my wish come true.
There were times when I thought to myself,
"Can one modest little witch really make a difference?"
But then I thought,
"What if Lucrezia Borgia had ever thrown in the towel, huh?"
Ah.
I go on.
I go on confident that, in the end, evil will triumph over good.
Very touching, if you were a troll.
BOOTS: Claudia, can I ask you a question?
-No.
-But what about...
-What about me?
-You?
Is that all you ever think about?
You exist on this planet for the sole reason that one night, in a weak moment, when my cable was out,
I chose to tolerate your companionship.
Aren't I your best...
What? Friend?
Is that the word?
You?
You and your needy little eyes and your twitchy ears.
You, with your incessant whining and scratching!
You, who fills the air with an acrid stench every time
-you come in the room after the rain.
-I got it, I got it!
Does that mean you're not going to be making me your partner?
Partner? (CACKLES)
But you promised!
Only a dumb mutt would believe a witch's promise.
Well, that's it, Boots. You're gonna be fixed.
MURRAY: You kids better get these wands out of here.
CLAUDIA: I've had just about enough.
Okay, okay. Get the wands out of here. Hurry!
You've got 1 5 minutes.
Don't stop for anything.
CLAUDIA: Bite me, will you?
-You're gonna get...
-No! No, you...
MURRAY: Get away from my wand.
-Get me back that wand.
-You gonna...
-MURRAY: You witch...
-CLAUDIA: That wand...
-Wand. You better get...
-MURRAY: No!
CLAUDIA: Boots, show yourself right now and maybe I won't have you stuffed.
You stupid animal.
Get back here with my wand.
There you are.
All right, Boots. Drop the wand at my feet, and I'll send you to the pound with a nice little rubber mouse, huh?
MURRAY: Come on, Bootsie, you want me to rub your little tummy?
Drop it now!
MURRAY: Come on, Bootsie.
Get back here, you stupid animal.
Oh, yes, Bootsie. Good girl, Boots. Yes!
Good riddance to you both!
No!
No!
No! No!
Do something, you idiot!
O Mirror, mirror, on the wall, now who's the smartest of them all?
I am. I am! I am!
Uh-oh!
We are. We are.
Where's my chin? Where's my...
Wave goodbye, Bootsie.
Perhaps it's time for some quiet reflection.
Murray!
Almost slipped on some collagen.
Murray, don't leave me like this.
You broke a mirror.
It's seven years bad luck, I tell you!
-Come on, Murray, come on, come on.
-Hurry, hurry.
The boat lake in Central Park. Move it!
Faster! If we don't get to Central Park before midnight, my dad will be a statue forever!
MURRAY: Anabel, quickly get a picture in your head.
All right. Here we go.
(STUTTERING) Shaboom!
Duchess!
CHARLIE: That's it?
I'm sorry, I...
I've nothing left.
What? How can you say that?
Murray, just forget about what Hortense said about midnight.
If you remember, she also said the real magic comes from inside.
So let's all hold hands.
-You, too, Charlie.
-Do I have to?
-ANABEL: Yes.
-Aw, man, this is so stupid.
ANABEL: Charlie, for once in your life, don't be a jerk.
Now see the wish.
Dad! Dad! It's really you.
You won't believe this.
First I went to Nebraska and this giant rabbi almost stepped on me, and then Duchess turned into a mouse.
It's really you!
Anabel, come here. Of course, it's me.
Anabel, Charlie. What?
What are we doing here? It's...
It's like...
What time is it?
It's after midnight. The callback!
I'm supposed to be at The Palace.
Okay, look,
I'm gonna have to call Jeri, they...
Did something happen to me?
No, no. Of course not.
Wait right here, Dad. You gotta meet Murray.
-He is right over here.
-Yeah, he's her fairy godmother.
He's a really cool guy.
-Murray? Murray?
-OLIVER: Come on, Duchess.
Come on, let me get you hitched up.
CHARLIE: Where is he? Where's the taxi?
It's okay, Anabel.
We didn't get to say goodbye or thanks or anything.
CHARLIE: But he was one hell of a fairy godmother.
Oh, your tooth!
Well, give it to me. So you don't lose it.
-I'm gonna miss Murray.
-I know.
I'm happy for him, though.
First one he got right.
OLIVER: What are you guys talking about?
MAN: Opening night. Get your program.
(SINGING) Far, far, better thing than l do now
MANNY: Keep it going, keep it moving.
Rabble over here.
-All right, you're up.
-Warming up for your one note in Act 2?
There's no shame in being an understudy.
I'm sure you'll be one again someday.
MANNY: Hurry now, come on.
Everyone, get in their place.
Watch your step, Tony. Don't fall.
MANNY: Kids at the back, come on.
I can't believe you did that.
The only way I'll be the lead in this show is if he...
I don't know, kicks the bucket or...
JERI: Relax. You're just saying what everyone else...
-Okay, kids, time to go.
-CHARLIE: Good luck, Dad.
TONY: Look at this. Who is this psycho?
I want a restraining order against this guy.
-Tony, gotta go.
-Miss Drescoll... When I'm good and ready.
What is with this dressing room?
It's more like a toilet.
It is a closet, Michael. It is a toilet.
One word, "big." I want "big."
You know what I love about you? Nothing!
Get out of my sight before I throw up.
Thanks for the flowers, they're beautiful.
TONY: And another thing,
I am the star of this show.
That curtain does not go up until I am ready.
-I'm sick and tired of this whole thing.
-Shaboom!
TONY: Look at me.
I think in percent and in return I expect 1 00%.
-Have you got that?
-I have it.
Agony. I am in agony.
I think my leg is broken.
I think that my leg is broken.
You know what? This show cannot go on.
I don't believe this curtain can go up.
-I do not think this show can go on.
-RICHARD: Mr. Sable...
But this show will go on.
...I have had it with you and your temperament.
You are out of my show, do you hear me? Out!
You'll not set foot on stage. Wardrobe!
OLIVER: I'll be looking for you in the third row, aisle.
RICHARD: Hold the curtain and open the microphone for an announcement.
-Easy.
-Okay, come on.
Okay, cue the announcement.
Everybody, stand by.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, at tonight's performance of Two Cities,
the role of Sydney Carton,
listed in your program as played by Tony Sable,
will be played by Oliver Greening.
Sorry.
Oh!
Don't you enjoy all of Lord Richard's love melodies?
-(POPS)
-(WOMAN GASPS)
(SINGING) The rats come creeping out
A certain slanted son shall die
Instinctively, we bow
Ð¢heir carriages just pass us by
Lovers...
It's a far, far better thing
That I do now
Than I have ever done before
You'll want to miss me
But not to kiss me
It's a far, far better thing
That I do now
Than I've ever done
-Before
-(CHOKING)
-Hello, Boots. There you go.
-Thank you.
A hit, a palpable hit.
Come on, honey. Let's go. There we go.
Yes, sir, you got it.
New York Post!
50-foot rabbi terrorizes Nebraska!
Now is the time.
This is the hour.
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.
Now is the time.
This is the hour.
Ours is the magic.
Ours is the power.
THE CRAFT
Move your seat to the upright position, please.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, darling.
The taxi's waiting.
Oh, yeah.
It's a lot drier in here, Dad.
Oh, God.
We need a new roof.
Yeah. But it's big.
I like the peg-and-groove floors.
Damask curtains would look really nice.
-Yeah. Gotta get this roof fixed, honey.
-Yeah.
I found this out back.
You want it?
Relax. What's the matter with you?
- Dad!
- What? What is it?
What the--
Get the hell out of here!
What the hell?
Sarah, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
He just surprised me, that's all.
Yeah, I guess.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You could wait-- just until you got a school uniform.
You don't have to go now.
I can't stay home and watch daytime TV for the rest of my life.
Why not? I could.
I just want to get started and get it over with.
- You look good. Good luck.
- Thanks.
-Jenny'll pick you up.
- I'll walk.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Hey, scary bitch alert.
Oh, God! I thought it was Satan.
Jesus Christ. She looking?
- Oh, God.
- Oh, she's looking.
Okay, I'll find a warm place-- safe, warm place.
The almanac says today will bring an arrival of something.
Yeah, wonderful.
I'm getting my rag.
A new wholeness, and with it a new balance.
Earth, air, water, fire.''
Maybe it's our fourth.
We don't need a fourth.
Nancy, we need someone to call out the corners-- north, south, east and west.
Four would make a circle.
Maybe she can be our fourth.
I love a woman in uniform.
Bonjour, class.
What?
Oh, you mean did I get laid?
Beaucoup de laid.
What is that snail trail over there saying about me?
You know, this is LA.
We should be learning Mexican.
That would be Spanish, genius.
She's here.
- She who?
- Someone to be the fourth.
She's the one.
You feeling okay?
That's her.
Hi. Do you guys mind if I sit with you?
'Cause I'm supposed to find a lab group.
Okay.
No, you can sit here.
Happy?
What?
- You're Sarah, right?
- Yeah.
Hi. I'm Chris.
I just wanted to apologize for those guys in French.
They're assholes.
You know what they say.
You are what you hang with.
Yeah, right.
Wait. Did you just call me an asshole?
- You did, didn't you?
- I'm sorry. My defenses are up.
People here have been really rude to me.
Really? Who else?
These three girls.
They're behind you.
Don't stare.
That's slick.
Oh, shit.
It's the bitches of Eastwick.
- What?
- Whatever you do, stay away from them.
- Why?
- You see the one on the right?
She's a major slut.
I don't know from experience or anything, but--
And the one in the middle, she's got burn scars all over her body.
I haven't seen them, but friends of mine have.
Anyway, they're--
Nah. Never mind.
What?
They're witches.
Witches?
That's what people say.
So what are you doing after school?
I don't know.
Nothing, I guess.
- Really?
- Really.
I'm busy.
Football practice.
You can come and watch.
Football practice.
That is so tempting.
Looking for someone?
Some of these football dicks make their girlfriends... come and watch them practice, as if it's interesting.
Yeah, like, girlfriend, over there--
Chris Hooker.
I don't even know him.
Nancy's sorry about what happened in biology.
And she's mean to everybody, so don't take it personally.
You're Nancy?
She's Nancy, I'm Bonnie and that's Rochelle.
- Hi. I'm Sarah.
- Yeah, we know who you are.
Do you want to go for coffee?
No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My dad's waiting for--
You can make something up.
Rochelle's ditching practice.
He comes on to anything with tits, Sarah.
Except me.
I'm not watching him.
He spreads disease.
I speak from personal experience.
Whoa, Chris! Go long!
Go for the pass, baby!
He's a jerk.
Come on.
- So you're coming, right?
- Where are we going?
Shopping.
Come on.
I don't have any money.
We get a five-finger discount.
Five-finger discount.
Sarah, where'd you live before?
San Francisco.
- Why'd you move?
- 'Cause it sucks.
My dad wanted to.
- Sucks here too.
- I know. You need a car here.
You need a car everywhere.
What's up with that?
I slit my wrists.
Sorry.
What'd you do it with?
With a kitchen knife.
You even did it the right way.
Yeah.
Punk rock. Let's go.
The right way  ?
How do you know the right way?
Shut up, Rochelle.
How do you know?
What?
Put this in your bag.
No.
Everything in nature steals, you know.
Big animals steal from little ones.
They steal for survival.
- Besides, I already have a diary.
- This is different.
You put spells and power thoughts in it... and then you don't let anyone else read it, ever.
Except maybe us.
Here.
You guys are really into all this?
Sort of.
That's not for you.
I'm sorry.
What a beautiful ring.
It was your mother's.
Yeah, it was.
Are you going to pay for those?
Uh-huh.
You're not like your friends.
You know how to use candles?
Yeah. You light the wick.
More than that.
Red is for love.
Black--
Actually--
Why you don't read that?
- It explains it all.
- Okay.
Twenty dollars.
You know, I've never read anything about this stuff before.
I mean, I don't follow it.
Maybe you're a natural witch.
Your power comes from within.
Come on, Sarah.
You guys, I think
I should head home.
Just look straight ahead and keep up.
Please? My baby needs some food.
- I don't have anything.
- Don't give them money.
- You're gonna get nailed.
- I don't have anything.
I know you.
I have another snake for you.
Wait a second.
I have to talk to you.
I had a dream about you.
In my dream, you were dead.
I'm talking to you.
Come back to Jesus, child.
- Don't you run away from me!
- I am the door, the way--
I know what I'm talking about!
I'm in touch with the man!
Listen to me!
Come on, Sarah.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, my God!
What is it? Do you think there's anybody back there?
It hit him. The car hit him, and we made it happen.
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Definitely.
I thought to myself,
It's gonna hit him.
- I thought it too.
- Sarah, did you think it?
- Yeah.
- Then that's it. Sarah's the fourth.
North, south, east and west.
We can make things happen.
- This is it. This is real.
- Shit.
You guys, this is really weird.
Well, I mean, he was after you.
He was gonna hurt you, man.
It's not our fault.
You guys, maybe he'll really listen now.
Who?
Manon.
What's that?
That's like God?
No. Man invented God.
This is older than that.
Do you guys worship the devil?
It's like God and the devil.
I mean, it's everything.
It's the trees, it's the ground, it's the rocks, it's the moon.
It's nature.
If God and the devil were playing football...
Manon would be the stadium that they played on.
It would be the sun that shone down on them.
So, does stuff like tonight happen to you a lot?
No. Not like that.
Other stuff.
Where did you learn it?
I don't know.
A natural witch.
I hate it.
It's always getting screwed up.
It's like, sometimes
I'll want it to rain... and a pipe will burst in my room and it'll just get flooded.
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.
Or I'll want it just to be quiet... and I'll wish for it, and I'll go deaf for three days straight.
If you can do that... have you ever heard of invoking the spirit?
It's when you call him.
Manon.
It's like--
It's like you take him into you.
It's like he fills you.
He takes everything that's gone wrong in your life... and he makes it all better again.
Nothing makes everything all better again.
Maybe not foryou.
Where are you going?
You guys are freaking me out.
Oh, she's scared.
Nancy, we need her.
Like a hole in the head.
She'll be back.
You sounded strange when I called last night.
- I didn't think you'd come.
- No, just surprised.
- Surprised?
- Yeah.
I thought you'd be hanging out with those girls.
- What girls?
- Those girls with the weird heads.
What's weird about their heads?
That one girl, she's got a mammoth head.
Really?
Yeah. She looks like a St. Bernard.
I haven't noticed her.
I hate that big head thing.
'Course it's better than that shrunken-head thing.
Little, tiny-- Makes you want to hang it from a rearview mirror.
What is your obsession with heads?
I was just noticing how great yours is.
- You like my head?
- Yeah. It's a good head.
- It's a good head?
- It's good.
It looks good for kissing.
Can I?
All right, we'll see you later, bro.
Nice meeting you, Sarah.
Yeah. Bye.
See you.
Come on. Let's go to my house.
Nobody's there.
I don't want to go.
I can't.
I gotta go home.
All right.
Are you mad?
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
So, hot stuff, how'd it go?
- How'd what go?
- Your date with Chris.
What are you talking about?
Chris already told everybody.
He told everybody what?
That you guys did it.
But we didn't do it.
Maybe he was just trying to save face then... because... he's going around the whole school saying that... you're the lousiest lay he's ever had.
And coming from him... that's pretty bad.
- No, he didn't.
- He did.
He said the same thing about Nancy.
Told you he was a jerk.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry.
Chris is really busy.
Maybe we could set something up for-- nice jacket-- later in the week.
What do you think?
Why'd you lie about me?
Look, I don't want to go out with you again.
Okay?
Please stop begging.
It's pathetic.
Fuck you.
Nah.
But I will.
She's gonna cry, and then I'm gonna cry.
We're all gonna cry.
Someone just doesn't want to go in the pool.
- Come on.
- This is a joke.
I can't even believe this.
Oh, wait. Here she goes.
Shark!
- Brilliant. Superb.
- Very good. It was great.
Oh, God, look.
There is a pubic hair in my brush.
Oh, no, wait. Wait.
That's just one of Rochelle's little nappy hairs.
Why are you doing this to me, Laura?
Do you think you're funny?
You really want to know why?
Yes, I really want to know why.
Because I don't like Negroids.
Sorry.
I've told you this before, but I want to be really clear.
This is a very experimental procedure... and we can't make any warranties regarding results or side effects.
I can tell you unofficially that there's little to no risk.
With this form of gene therapy, it's relatively noninvasive.
It can be somewhat painful, but noninvasive.
Okay. Try to stay relaxed.
I'm moving the armature over you now.
And you'll feel a little sting when the needle penetrates.
And then more when the needle moves.
I'll try and keep it as brief as possible.
Hold very still, but keep breathing.
Okay?
Good. Keep your body relaxed.
Just a little more, Bonnie.
Don't move.
Ray, the light's out!
Oh, man!
You didn't even pay the bill.
I gave you the money.
What are you doing home so late?
You're late!
It's the storm, Grace.
It's the connection.
- Oh, it's the storm?
- That's why the lights are out.
Neighbor's lights aren't out.
Got a light?
I give you money.
You tell me you pay the bill.
You can't even pay a bill?
What are you good for?
You know what I'm good for.
We're going on a field trip.
Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt your little social gathering.
Sorry, Sister.
You girls watch out for those weirdos.
We are the weirdos, mister.
Earth, air, fire, water.
Earth, air, fire, water.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade... than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade... than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade... than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
That's a girl.
As above... so below.
I drink of my sisters... and I ask for the ability... to not hate those who hate me-- especially racist pieces... of bleached-blonde shit like Laura Lizzie.
Right on.
I drink of my sisters... and I ask to love myself more... and to allow myself to be loved more by others-- especially Chris Hooker.
I know it's pathetic.
Definitely pathetic.
I drink of my sisters... and I take into myself the power to be beautiful... outside as well as in.
I drink of my sisters... and I take into myself... all the power of Manon.
That's all?
Blessed be.
Thought you were gonna burp.
Oh, my God.
What?
Look.
It's Manon.
It's so beautiful.
He's listening to us.
- Do you think it's working?
- I don't know.
I think he just looked at me.
Did he look at me? Is he looking?
- Not right now, but he just did.
- So weird.
I know. Now he's looking.
- He's looking?
- Yes.
Is he still back there?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Never mind.
It's working.
That or he's gone completely crazy.
- You hate me, right?
- No.
- You don't?
- No.
'Cause, you see, when you're a guy-- and I am-- people expect things.
I mean, I know I said some nasty things about you.
- Did you tell your friends?
- What?
That you're a lying sack of shit.
No. But I will.
I'll tell them tomorrow.
I'll tell the truth.
Good.
- Can I sit with you in Mass?
- Yeah, sure.
Watch this.
Chris, could you carry these for me?
- They're really heavy.
- Yeah.
And Bonnie's too.
She's got a bad back.
And this. Thanks.
I can't believe it.
Could you hold my jock for me?
It's kind of heavy.
In the book of Genesis--
What are you, Stepford boy?
Sit.
Pay attention.
It's working.
Check it out.
Her spell is working.
Nancy, oh, my God.
Would you look?
Oh, great. Really bad.
- Get one in, already.
- It's hard, you know.
You're, like, two feet away from each other.
- Get off!.
- I'm not that heavy.
Yeah, you're light as a feather... during deep space travel.
I am, actually.
Did you ever play that game,
Light as a feather, stiffas a board  ?
One girl lays down, and you surround her... and you put your fingers underneath.
You put your fingers where?
Okay.
Now you take your index finger... and your middle finger... and you put it under her like this.
Now you have to imagine that she's incredibly light... like she's made out of air.
Now, is that her whole body, or just her head?
Cow.
You guys, concentrate or it's not gonna work.
I think I sprained my finger.
- Shut up!
- Focus!
Come on, you guys.
Ready?
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
Holy shit.
You guys, it's not working.
Shut up, or you're gonna fall.
How do I get down?
Who's got the instructions?
Just keep concentrating.
Amazing.
Hi. I got clean towels for everyone.
- Oh, my butt!
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing. Why?
- Are you girls getting high?
Are you okay?
You gotta try it.
So I say we all chip in for it.
How much can you give?
You pulled my hair out!
Sorry. I thought I saw a bug.
They have shampoo for that, you know.
Stupid bitch.
- Laura really has split ends.
- Really?
I guess this confirms she's not a natural blonde.
Bleach.
What do you think will happen to Laura?
I don't know.
If she leaves you alone, nothing will happen to her.
Nothing good.
Fat chance.
Who's that?
That's my real mother.
Where is she?
She died when she was having me.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Manon, take my scars.
Give me beauty outside as well as in.
Manon, take my scars.
Thank you.
Don't hit your head on the board.
Put a lid on it, Laura.
Oh, my God.
What? What happened?
I don't know!
What does it look like?
I don't know.
Hold still.
Gross!
- Is there a mark?
- Did you hit your head on something?
Now, I want you to remember that we may need to make several passes... before we can see any results.
Is it better?
I can't tell yet, dear.
Just a minute.
What does it look like?
I don't know.
Just wait.
I can't believe it.
It worked.
- What?
- It worked.
'Cause seriously, if you don't stop it, you can go blind.
Hairy palms?
She was supposed to come back today.
Did you talk to her?
Principal Draper has called a special assembly... during the second half of the fifth per--
Homeroom starts at 8:45 sharp.
Sorry.
My pedicure ran late.
- Wow.
- Holy shit.
- Hi, Bonnie.
- How's it going?
- Yeah, how's it going, Bonnie?
- My God.
You look so beautiful.
I can't believe it.
You did it.
No, I didn't do it.
- Yeah, you totally did it.
- I helped.
Come on. You made Chris love you.
You own him.
You made Laura Lizzie's hair fall out.
You guys should see her.
She has to wear a hat every day now.
Poor Laura.
What's wrong with Nancy?
- Her spell's not working.
- What spell?
I don't know. I think she doesn't want to be white trash any more.
And I told her,  "You're white, honey.
Just deal with it."
Good.
Okay. Come on, come on.
- I can almost see through this thing.
- Leave me alone!
- God!
-Jesus!
You're supposed to act like a father to the girl.
- I ain't her father.
- Thank God.
Her father's the one who paid you the
50 bucks for a bang in the back seat.
Damn it!
- Don't you ever hit me!
- Don't you touch her!
Stop!
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God!
Pig.
Ray?
Oxygen is flowing.
What's happening?
What's happening to him?
I know this is a difficult time for you... but it is procedure that I ask just a few questions... before we can start processing the policy.
I don't understand.
What policy?
Mr. Saunders had a whole life pension plan through the company... and with benefits this size... it's standard that I--
What size?
Just a second here.
Sorry.
A hundred--
Wait. Are you saying that this goes to us?
To you.
A hundred and seventy-five--
What a dear, sweet man.
I can't believe he's dead.
- Do you think we killed him?
- No. Not at all.
Now don't be shy, honey.
Nice ass.
- What? He has a cute butt.
- You're a slut.
- Maybe you should go ask him out.
- You know it.
Yeah.   I like your butt.
Do you want to have dinner?
This is nice.
Bedroom, bathroom, nightmare.
You look so pretty. I'm so glad you could come and see our apartment.
Our apartment.
We have an apartment!
And it's so big.
And look at this view.
- It's beautiful.
- And the couch--
This is our couch.
I love this couch.
I saw it in the window and said,
I have to have this couch.
And the guy, what an attitude.
I said,    Honey, wrap it up.
I'm taking it right now.
Cash!
My juke box.
Every song on here is by Connie Francis.
Yeah! Isn't that great?
Ever since I was a little girl
I said...
All I want in life is a juke box... that plays nothing but Connie Francis records.''
That's great.
Who's Connie Francis?
Oh, shut up, honey.
Listen and learn. Connie Francis.
Can you come to my room, girls?
- Let's go.
- It was nice to see you, Mrs. Downs.
Connie Francis is--
Wait a minute here.
Let's have a little house warming party.
Sorry, Mom.
This is cool.
Ooh, nice.
I was reading and I found something
I thought you guys might be into.
Glamour. Throwing a glamour-- an illusion so real as to fool an onlooker-- is one of the oldest forms of magic.
- Bet you I could do that.
- Do you think?
This is to feel.
This is to be.
Shape and form it... for all to see.
By the power of three times three... as I will it... so shall it be.
What?
My eyes are brown.
They're usually green.
You can do that with contacts.
Yeah, but it's good.
I mean, it suits you.
Subtle. But good.
You want something bigger?
- I want bigger.
- Bigger.
We have to concentrate.
Come on.
Ready?
Are you impressed?
- Yeah, I'm impressed!
- You look like Loni Anderson.
- You want to touch it?
- Yeah.
It's real!
And so much simpler than going to a salon.
- Yeah, a really shitty salon.
- You try it.
Wait. Watch.
- Make me a blonde.
- Me, me, me.
I don't think so.
No way.
Do something to me.
What do you want?
A smaller ass.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Oh, no. No.
Why didn't you answer the phone?
It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris.
Oh, yeah, that's a good reason.
You know what I was thinking?
Maybe we could move in together.
I don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment right now.
Oh, shit.
It's just that I can't stop thinking about you.
I don't know why, but I think I love you.
I've never loved anyone before, except... maybe my mom and this little puppy
I had when I was little.
I think you should go home, Chris.
No! Sarah, wait, please.
Sarah, please. Look.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
Can I help you?
No. Nobody can help me.
Here again.
What can I do for you today?
We need provisions.
I need to undo a love spell.
When you open a floodgate, how do you undo it?
You unleash something with a spell.
There is no undoing.
It must run its course.
You should let him suffer.
It's not for you to judge suffering.
When do we find out what's behind the curtain?
What are you doing, hiding all the missing kids from the neighborhood?
What's there? Black magic?
True magic is neither black nor white.
It's both because nature is both.
Loving and cruel, all at the same time.
The only good or bad is in the heart of the witch.
Life keeps a balance on its own.
You understand?
Not really.
Well, then understand this.
Whatever you send out you get back times three.
Wait. We didn't read that in any book.
No, it's part of a basic spiritual truth... said in many ways in many faiths.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
I wanna buy this book.
You want to invoke the spirit?
You must be experienced to do this.
It's very dangerous.
Look, lady, I'm a big girl, okay?
Now please just sell me the book.
- How much?
- Twenty-five.
What do you know?
I have money.
When things were the worst for me... just before I tried to kill myself...
I used to hallucinate things.
I'd close my eyes, and all I would see were... snakes and bugs everywhere.
Then I'd open them, and they'd still be there.
They wouldn't go away.
They're everywhere.
You know, the serpent is a very powerful being.
You should respect it.
Aren't you powerful?
Yes, you are.
All right.
Enough screwing around.
Let's call the corners, shall we?
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the east... the powers of air and invention.
Hear me!
- Us!
- Hear us.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the south... powers of fire and feeling.
Hear us.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the west... powers of water and intuition.
Hear us.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north... by the powers of mother and earth.
Hear us.
Aid us in our magical working on this May's eve.
Serpent of old... ruler of deep... guardian of the bitter sea... show us your glory... show us your power.
We pray of thee.
We invoke thee.
O serpent one, hear our calls.
Hear our prayers.
Ancient wise one... teach us thy ways.
We summon and stir thee.
Lend us your powers.
Show us your glory.
We invoke thee!
Manon, fill me!
Is he here?
Did you feel that?
He blessed me.
I can feel him running through my veins.
He's still in me.
It's so amazing.
Look at this.
It's so beautiful.
This is a gift.
These are my gifts!
I can feel you in me!
I'm your daughter now.
He's everywhere!
He's in everything!
Listen, all I'm saying is
I think it's enough already.
I don't know what's going on with this.
I'm completely humiliating Chris... when all I wanted was for him to like me.
And Bonnie, what's going on with you?
You used to be nice.
Now you're completely narcissistic.
Excuse me, but I spent a big chunk of my life being a monster.
Now that I'm not, I'm having a good time. Sorry if that bothers you.
Can you guys tell me what color that light is?
It's red.
Doesn't red mean stop?
Yeah, red does mean stop.
It's like what Lirio was talking about-- throwing things out of balance.
I know you thinkwe're getting what we want now... but it's going to come back to us threefold.
Are we actually having a theological conversation here?
I mean, it's fun, it's scary.
I mean, who gives a shit?
Oh, Nancy, we do.
What do you guys think?
- They don't think.
- Bitch!
Stop trying to win them over, because it won't work.
I'm not trying to win them over.
You're paranoid.
- I'm paranoid?
- Paranoid.
I am not paranoid!
- Paranoid.
- Will you guys shut up!
Do you want in, or do you want to leave this circle?
Just tell me right now.
Why must it always be that way with you?
Because that's the way it is!
All I'm saying is,
I think you should think.
And I don't want out.
One of these times, the lights not gonna be green.
Oh, waah!
We're scared, Sarah?
You scared, hmm?
That was actually pretty close.
It just keeps falling out.
I don't understand it.
What did I do to deserve this?
Laura!
What's the matter?
What happened?
I don't know.
Calm down. Calm down.
It's okay.
I'm gonna go get somebody, okay?
Stay right here.
Sarah, come on, please.
You look like you need to talk to someone anyways.
How do you know what I look like?
We're talking on the phone.
Look, it's important.
I just need to be alone with you.
I have to see you.
I don't know why, but--
Why are you being this way?
It's just dinner. Come on.
I don't know.
Please.
Okay. Tomorrow night.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
- I'll see you then.
- Bye.
So when I started hanging out with them, I was almost relieved.
I didn't have that many close friends in San Francisco.
It just felt really nice to belong.
I disagreed with them once, and they turned their backs on me.
That's not friendship.
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
- You do?
Yeah. Sometimes it's like we're one person. Know what I mean?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure either.
That's so funny.
I was just thinking,
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
Aren't we supposed to go to a restaurant or something like that?
No.
All right. Look, Chris.
I know you think you feel really intensely... but do you ever stop and wonder where it comes from?
I can't think.
I just feel.
It's weird how it happened.
One day, I couldn't wait to see you.
It's like that every day, but now that I have you, I'm not letting go.
Stop and think about what you're saying.
You don't even know me.
Here. I'll give you a back rub.
I don't want a back rub.
I don't want you to. Just let go.
Just relax for a second.
Turn around.
- I think you should take me home.
- No! Sarah, come on.
- Take me home, okay?
-Just hold me, okay?
- Let go.
- Hold me first.
Fine. I'll walk.
Goddamn it!
Sarah, get back--
Come back here.
- Goddamn it!
- Please, Chris! Let go of my arm!
Stay still!
No! Please!
Let go!
Oh, my God.
Sarah, come here.
What happened?
Are you okay?
You should've seen the look in his eyes.
It was so weird.
They seemed empty, like it wasn't even him.
Where would he be?
There's a party.
At Trey's.
Just leave it alone.
Don't go.
You're not going to help anything.
I'm gonna go play.
I cannot believe she's here.
You guys...
Nancy Downs is here.
Nancy?
I'm here. You're here.
We're all here.
Is Sarah with you?
What's going on?
Where is she?
You and me, we've had some pretty good times together.
If I remember correctly... we had some pretty hot times too.
- Remember?
- I've been trying to forget.
Forget?
- Did you forget this?
- Stop.
What's the matter?
Not in the mood?
Not to get my dick bitten off.
What makes you think that's what I wanna do?
Go away.
Go away.
What the--
Surprise.
Make love to me, Chris.
We should not be here.
Neither should Nancy.
Rochelle.
How's it going?
Fine.
Listen.
You're a witch!
- They were right.
- They usually are.
- Nancy, get off the bed. Let's go.
- She's a witch too.
The only reason you're in love with her is because she cast a spell on you.
Yes. Sad, but true.
That's why I'm here-- to help you forget about her.
- What do you care?
- Nancy, get off the bed!
You scared the shit out of him.
Thank you very much. Let's go.
No! He's gotta pay.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Jealous?
You don't even exist to me!
You don't even exist.
You are nothing.
You are shit.
You don't exist.
The only way you know how to treat women is by treating them like whores!
When you're the whore!
And that's gonna stop!
Do you understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying, huh?
I'm sorry.
He's sorry?
Oh, he's sorry!
He's sorry! He's sorry!
Sorry, my ass!
I didn't want him to get hurt.
I liked him.
I think that he was a good guy underneath it all.
I didn't know that it would go this far.
Honey, come on.
I mean, it's hard for you.
- It was an accident.
- Dad, I need to be alone right now.
- Please, honey, listen.
- Don't touch me!
Everything I touch turns to shit.
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy.... harm against other people... and harm against yourself.
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy.
Harm against other people... and harm against yourself.
Stop it!
Stop it!
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
We heard the police came to your house.
They came to mine too.
Yeah. Well, I didn't tell them anything.
Then why do you want to leave the circle?
- I didn't say--
- You don't need to say it.
You're thinking it.
Look, people are dead.
Chris and Ray are--
Those were accidents.
- They deserved it.
- Says who?
Says me.
You know it's true.
Fine. Whatever. I'm out.
Fine. That's fine.
We don't really need a fourth anymore, do we?
But if you're gonna leave the circle... you might want to think about leaving the school.
And maybe the city too.
We're not sure.
Or the planet.
And please don't do any more spells on me.
I didn't--
You know, in the old days... if a witch betrayed her coven... they would kill her.
Bye!
Sweet dreams, Sarah.
How have you been sleeping?
Hello?
Yes?
Hello.
- Hi.
- What's wrong?
Oh, darling, what's wrong?
I know I don't know you very well... but I just didn't know where else to go.
It's those girls that I always come in here with.
They're trying to use magic against me.
You don't understand.
They killed people.
I tried to do a binding, and it didn't work.
And now, it's like everywhere I turn, they're all around me.
No matter what I do, they're still there. I don't know what to do.
You understand?
She's inside my dreams.
She knows what's going on inside my head. She can read my mind.
I'm so sorry. I just didn't have anywhere else to go.
Please.
Come.
What is this?
This temple is built on a place of power.
Sarah, you have a tremendous light inside you... more than any witch
I've ever known.
You must not be afraid.
I can't control it.
I always end up hurting somebody.
Do you hear the voice of your mother?
What about her?
She's telling you to be strong.
She was a witch, too, of course.
Didn't you know?
You can defeat those who challenge you... but you must surrender yourself... to the higher power.
You must invoke the spirit.
But it made Nancy crazy.
She takes it to a dark place.
- Don't be afraid. Invoke him.
- I can't.
There is no other way.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north--
It's Nancy.
I can't stay here.
No, Sarah! Stop! Sarah!
Hello?
Dad!
Jenny!
- Hello?
- They're gone.
They flew back to San Francisco.
They thought you ranaway back home.
Look, Sarah... there's been an accident, man.
What are you talking about?
- What?
- It's been allover the news.
Go look at your TV.
Wreckage from the plane was scattered over a one-mile square area.
Authorities suspect severe wind shear... may have been responsible for today's tragedy.
FAA officials have retrieved the blackbox... and a full investigationi spending.
Onceagain,
Global flight 321... from Los Angeles to San Francisco has crashed with no survivors.
More on this story as details become available.
Oh, my God.
Please. Please stop it.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Go away, please!
- Stop it!
- Gotcha!
God, if I was as pathetic as you are...
I would have killed myself ages ago.
You should get on with it.
Where are my dad and Jenny?
You'll be seeing them soon enough.
You're going to kill yourself tonight, my dear.
No, I'm not.
Surprise.
Really?
Look in your eyes tells me... you might not be so sure.
After all, you have every reason in the world to do it.
I mean, you killed Chris... and you killed your mom--
You killed your mom when you were coming out of her.
Now, that is really special.
Even I couldn't go that low.
Bravo!
Stop it, please!
What's the deal?
Why doesn't she use magic on us?
Because she's weak!
Weak, weak, weak.
Stop, please.
Oh, God, you're so disgusting.
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.
Now is the end.
Let her go in peace.
- I didn't write that.
- It doesn't matter.
Hand writing still looks the same.
What's wrong with your scars, Sarah?
It isn't real.
Then why are you still bleeding?
Run!
Run back up to your room like the little coward that you are.
That's right.
She's so pathetic!
Stop it!
- Please, somebody help me!
- I'm bleeding!
Please.
What can I do?
Rochelle, go upstairs.
See what's going on.
No. This whole thing is just--
Get your lazy ass up those stairs or I'll slit your throat!
- Dead as she is.
- Come on. I'll go with you.
Little shit.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north... by the powers of mother and earth.
I invoke thee.
I invoke thee.
By the powers of three times three, make them see, make them see.
Bonnie?
My hair. My hair!
It's coming back times three.
Not again.
What happened?
Where are you going?
Hail to the guardians of the... watchtowers--
Don't be afraid.
Reach inside yourself.
Reach inside yourself.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north... by the powers of mother and earth.
I invoke thee.
I invoke thee, Manon.
I invoke thee, Manon.
Did I frighten you, Nancy?
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Why aren't you dead?
Came to me.
Saved me.
And he wanted me to give you a message.
You're in deep shit.
He says you've abused what he's given you and now you have to pay the price.
Did he?
He did.
By the way, what happened to Rochelle and Bonnie?
They rushed out of here without even saying good-bye.
That's bad manners.
What's going on?
What is going on?
Stop it! Stop it!
Relax. It's only magic.
Now who's pathetic?
Look.
I know I'm a little crazy.
I don't mean to be.
It all got out of hand, and I'm sorry.
No more games, okay?
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
Good.
- I'm gonna go.
- One thing first.
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm... harm against other people and harm against yourself.
Wait.
Wait.
I called him before you!
You bitch! You bitch!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Where are you?
Where are you, Sarah?
Where are you?
Tricky. Tricky, tricky, tricky.
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm.
Hi, Sarah. How are you?
Good.
Then again,
I can sleep at night, so--
How are you?
We want to apologize.
- We feel really bad about--
- Trying to kill me?
Yeah.
Honestly, we never thought it would go that far.
Hi, girls.
How're you doin'?
Hi, Mr. Bailey.
And you know that thing on TV about the plane crash... was just a glamour.
It was a practical joke.
Funny.
Sarah, wait.
We were just wondering, do you still have any powers?
'Cause we don't.
Sorry.
So if you ever want to just hang out... and chant or call the corners--
Maybe.
Hold your breath until I call.
She probably doesn't have any powers anyway.
Be careful.
You don't want to end up like Nancy.
It's you. It's you.
He gave me power.
I can do whatever I want now.
I can fly.
He gave you somethin', honey, but it ain't the power.
But I can fly. I'm flying.
I'm flying.
I'm flying.

Hey, George.
Born in poverty
You gonna just stand there or you gonna help me with these boxes?
Now what have you got me carryin', huh?
Got a deal on solar panels and batteries.
Well, I told you I wasn't doin' any more improvements on the house.
- I'm sellin' this place someday.
- Yeah, right.
But I see you improved the garden anyway.
- Yeah. And that goddamn rabbit still got in there.
- [ Chuckles ]
I told you. He went under your fence, George.
- He did not.
- He did too.
I put that fence a foot and a half underneath the ground.
Well, it's a mystery, George.
Anyway, this solar outfit, it's going to save you money, and it's free.
So happy birthday.
Thanks, Nate.
Thank you.
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Sighs ]
- Who's gonna put it together? Huh?
- Not me.
It comes with a manual in three different languages.
Forget it. Look, if it's a car, I can fix it.
If it's in the garden,
I probably can grow it. But--
This is way out of my neighborhood.
Hey, you, uh--
You bringin' a date tonight?
No. You?
- Well, I'm thinkin' of askin' somebody.
- When?
Today? You don't give 'em much notice, do you?
Well, you even ask anybody? Huh?
- I always ask Diana Ross, but she never says yes to me.
- [ Radio: The Supremes ]
- See you.
- See you later.
[ The Supremes ]
That you never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me cryin' baby, for you
Keeps me sighin' baby, for you
So won't you hurry
- Come on, boy
See about me

Hey, George, George.
I forgot to tell you, man.

Que vayas a su ventana.

- He wants you to look at his window.
- Man!
How you doin', Lace?
You look great.
Yeah. How are the chairs sellin'?
I got one left.
I need four more.
Wow. It's going a lot better than I expected.
- Yeah? Well, you know, people sit down a lot around here.
- Yeah.
- Here. I can get these.
- No, I got it. Thanks.
Well, I'll help you.
Hey, uh, Lace. There's a-- There's a party tonight at the Elkhorn Bar.
Why do they call it that?
There's no elk around here.
I don't know. They just always called it the Elkhorn.
Why? They got some poor elk's horn hangin' over the bar?
[ Laughs ]
I don't think so.
Anyway, it's my birthday today, and there's a party tonight at the Elkhorn.
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yup.
- George!
- Oh. I gotta look up here at 10:00.
- Why?
- Well, that's Doc Brunder's office. Have you met him yet?
- No. What does he want?
- I don't know.
So, uh, hey, uh-- Do you-- Do you think you could come to the party?
No. I don't like to leave my kids home alone at night.
- Well, I know a good baby-sitter. Tito's wife.
- I live really far out.
- You know Tito. Tito? Tito!
- Really.
[ Lace ]
Hey, George.
- Hey. That's nice.
- Mmm.

Would you please come tonight?
No. Not tonight.

Well. Then I'll keep askin'.

- Yo! George doesn't buy drinks tonight. It's his birthday.
- Doc! Hey, you made it.
- For you.
- [ Woman ] Hey, hi!
- How's everybody?
- Hey.
- Still breathing in and out?
[ Chuckles ]
- Doc, you gotta try--
You gotta try that cake.
- What?
- Tito's wife made it.
It is macho bueno.
- Macho!
- Oh, Doc. Thank you.
- [ Man ] Hey, Jimmy!
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.
You're learning the moves,
George, but you've never played amidst turmoil and confusion.
I wish we could go back to checkers. Maybe I could win.
No, no, no, no.
You have potential, George.
I always said George Malley has something extra to offer this world.
- I said that the day I, uh, circumcised you.
- [ Tito Laughs ]
- He says that every birthday!
- It was a bad joke, I know.
- [ Chuckles ]
- You know, you ruined my chance of romance today...
- with that obscene stunt in the window.
- It was an outrage!
- A criminal act.
- It was a disgrace!
Okay, there was a beautiful girl who walked right away from me.
- It was so embarrassing.
- George, you talking about the one with the chairs?
- Yeah.
- They-- They are not all that comfortable.
Well, I think they're perfect, but you gotta learn how to sit in 'em.
Ah, here you go. On the house, everybody. Happy birthday.
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy.
There's no smoking section in heaven.
Aw, don't start, Doc. Don't start.
Pass those out. Pass 'em out.

Yup. Happy birthday.
Ah.

There was th-that light?
- What kind of light?
- Y-You know, there was a noise.
- D-Did you hear it?
- No.
[ Doc ] Could we finish the game, George?
Man. I-I-It was like-- like-- like an explosion.
- A-A-And-- And it was a flash--
- Like a plane?
- A-A-And-- And it was a flash--
- Like a plane?
No. It was bigger than that.
I-I-It was farther away.
Oh, you mean like a star, George?
Man, it knocked me off my feet.
- [ Doc ] You fell?
- Yeah, I fell! I was hit right--
- [ Laughing ] The man's inebriated.
- I warned you.
- I'm not drunk, Nate.
- I'm takin' your queen,
George. Now pay attention.
Isn't that checkmate?
That's checkmate, isn't it?
You mean he beat you?
- You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?
- I-I didn't let him win anything.
You're a little pissed off about that, aren't you?
- Play another one?
- You can get your revenge on me tomorrow, all right?
- You feeling okay?
- Yep.
- Can you drive, George?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Happy birthday, George.

Jesus, George! What are you doing calling me? It's late.
I thought that farmers got up when it was still dark.
That's if you have cows.
I don't have any cows, George.
- Now, look. There's only one explanation for that rabbit.
- What!
You see, when I built that fence higher and deeper, he was already in there.
See? He was hiding.
I fenced him in! [ Laughs ]
- There's only one thing
I can do now, just let him out.
- Good night, George.
Good night.

George, can I have my Bronco back?
I don't have any cash right now, but I need my car.
Well, I need some solar panels installed on my roof.
I don't know anything about solar.
Well, Charlie Shipper does. And, uh--
He needs a well dug on his property.
You help him dig the well, he'll help me with the panels, and I'll fix your car.
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal!
I'll, uh--
I'll call Charlie.
Hi. I just called about, uh, fixin' my brakes.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Be right with you. Uh, Tito.

- His name's Al.
- What's your name?
Glory.
Well, I'm George.
Pop the hood, Al.
Why?
- You know how to start this thing?
- Duh.
- [ Engine Starts ]
- Ah.
Emergency road service, ma'am.
- Truck can't breathe, and your idle's too fast.
- Mm, sorry. Gotta go.
Where? You're not, uh, leavin' town, are you?
No. Just San Francisco for the day.
Oh, I used to live there. Ask--
Ask me directions on where you're going.
As a matter of fact, ask me anything at all. You could even ask me to come along.
I'd show you the sights, the hazards.
What do you think?
I think your idle's too fast.
San Francisco, huh?
- But you were born here, right?
- How'd you know I was born here?
Just now, in the store. Someone said,
'I've known George Malley all my life.
And if he said he saw a UFO, he saw one.'
I didn't say that.
- [ Al ] You saw one?
- But I didn't say what I saw.
- [ Glory ] What'd it look like?
- Well, it could've been!
That's mate, Doc.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
George!
What in the hell is goin' on here? What?
Look, you know, I don't know, Doc.
I-I-I really don't know.
It's just lately I've been-- been seeing things so clearly, you know. l, uh-- You know,
I understand right away.
I concentrate. And, uh--
And books. I can't stop feeding myself.
I-I read two-- two, three books a day. Imagine that.
And-- And-- You know, I can't stop, and I-I-I can't sleep.
You know, ever since the, uh--
I-I-I gotta go.
Get back to work.
[ Jimmy, Roger ]
Ever since... the sighting.
[ Laughs ]
Roger, it was a damn light!
- And a boom.
- Now, did you hear it?
Well, no.
Anybody?
About nine days ago, right outside here?
Was that 12:00, George?
George, come in for a physical. Okay?
George.
- Two or three books a day?
- At least.
- About what?
- About everything.
You know, all the things
I've wanted to know about and learn.
Like what?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, you tell me, Rog.
I mean, what have you always wanted to know about and learn?
Hmm?
Think about it.
I'm waiting for ignition
I'm looking for a spark
Any chance collision and I light up in the dark
Such a nice emotion
Do not know where it goes
I'm equipped for movement
And I have the touch
Any social occasion it's 'Hello, how do you do'
All those introductions
I never miss my cue
So before a question
So before a doubt
My hand moves out and
- I have the touch
- [ Barks ]
Only, only
Wanting contact
With you
Shake those hands
Shake those hands
Shake hands
- [ Laughs ]
- [ Doc Reading Aloud ]
- Shake hands
I have the touch
[ Nate ] CQ, this is WB6QLF, standing by.
Searcher out of Harmon, California.
Is anybody in the void tonight?
I'm lookin' for Diana Ross,
- but I'll accept any voice in the English tongue.
- [ Crash ]
- [ George Muttering ]
- Is that you, Diana?
- Hey, George.
- Now, look, Nate.
You haven't sat 'til you've put your ass on one of these homemade willow chairs. Okay?
Now, I brought you a pair so you can put your feet up, or if you, uh, want a friend to sit in there, if you decide one day and invite someone over.
What do you think?
I don't think they go, George.
Oh, what would you know?
Looks like a swap meet blew in here.
Talk about needin' a woman's touch.
This is an emergency.
Hey, Nate. I've been workin' on that solar kit you gave me.
I am telling you, the whole field of photovoltaics is-- is just in baby land!
I mean-- You know--
The-- The idea that plants have been storing and-- and using the sun's energy since the birth of the world!
I mean, photosynthesis is-- is a model for us, and we're just scratching the surface... of what we could do with these silicon cells.
I'm telling you.
[ Sighs ] What?
What?
You just talk so fast, George.
And-- And you know so much stuff.
I'm sorry. But--
I can't help it, Nate.
- That's okay.
- Mmm.
- [ High-Pitched Radio Beeps ]
- What is that?
Uh, it's just computers talking to computers.
- Shh. Leave it, leave it, leave it.
- Aw, come on.
- The Morse code's goin' too fast for you to pick that out.
- No, no, no. It's--
- I can hear it.
- Bull.
No. I'll tell you what it is. A repeated pattern.
They're looping a message.
[ Nate ]
'Watering the golds... Friday.'
Yeah. Yeah. Now, who'd be sending a coded message like that in simple Morse?
Oh, man, look. I pick up, like two different air force bases.
I think we better leave this one alone, George.
- Mm. No, no, this is a different one. Listen, listen!
- [ Beeps Continue ]
This one's much denser, but i-it's still a loop.
It still repeats.
Listen.
- Seriously, I think--
- Oh, I gotta record this.
- We ought to leave this alone.
- Where's your-- No, no, no, no.
What are you doin'?
Well, I'm gonna take it home so I can break it down. Then we can answer it.
- Why?
- Because it gives me something to do, Nate.
[ Sighs ] I don't know if it's gettin' worse or it's gettin' better.
But, you know, I have 12 hours in the night to kill. And I--
When I get tired of reading,
I do crossword puzzles, but they're all too simple.
- [ Laughs ] Too simple.
- [ Chuckles ]
And then everybody I know is asleep, and I'm-- I'm awake at night.
Is there something-- something I could do?
Hey! Why don't we just go outside and box?
I could split your lip again. You'll--
Yeah, you'll feel a lot better.
No.
Hey, if you sent a message, would they get it?
- Yeah, sure. Uh--
- Send this.
Send them, 'Don't, uh--
Don't overwater the golds.' Say that.
- Okay, fine. The golds?
- Marigolds.
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, no, no. Say, 'Don't overwater the marigolds Friday.'
- [ Beeping, Clicking ]
- Don't overwater... the marigolds on Friday.
- Right.
- 'We'll be watching.'
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Watching.
Oh, God. This is cool.

See? Here-- Here you go.
Okay!
[ Sighs ]
All right. Okay.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, man!
Is somebody trying to tell me something?
Huh?
What?
[ Exhales ]
- Did you pee in the cup?
- Yup.
- You still having trouble sleeping?
- Yup. Any ideas?
How long have you been feeling this way?
Well, you know how long I've been feeling this way. Everybody does.
I mean, it's been over a month since my birthday.
Notice anything else? Or--
Yeah.
What?
Well, watch your fountain pen there.
What do you mean?
Ohh! Uh--
[ Chuckles ]
- That's telekinesis.
- Yeah.
Is that okay?
Do it again.
Do it again.
You know, uh, I consider myself a rational man.
A man of science. You know, open to... whatever. But, uh--
I feel like a child,
George. I feel scared.
Me too.
Well, whatever the reason is,
I promise you we'll find it. Okay?
[ Chuckles ] Now, let me see you do that one more time.
[ Engine Revving, Rattling ]
It's a monster, George.
Yup, yup. This old
Frankenstein here... gets 90 miles to the gallon on methane.
And it's made from my garbage...
[ Chuckles ] and Nate's pig manure-- special blend.
- Sure smells like it.
- [ Chuckles ]
[ Banes ]
See, Georgie?
- [ George ] Hello, Lace.
- Hey.
These are a little bit different. I used a little bit of a wider branch on these.
Yeah, they look great.
- George, are these yours?
- Yeah. Yeah. I've been, uh, workin' on some, uh, special organic fertilizers.
- Go ahead, taste it.
- Mmm.
No, no, no.
Bite into it like a-- like an apple.
- Oh!
- You got some on your chin. Sorry.
Maybe, uh-- Maybe the kids would like some.
- That's great. Thanks.
- No, no, no. Lace, wait.
Let me pick some out for you, okay?
If the kids like 'em, you know, y-y-you could make anything.
You could make some sauce or a soup.
George, I thought you were smart.
[ Tito ]
Hey, what's she got, anyway?
Yeah. Yeah, besides uncomfortable chairs.
My heart, amigos.
My heart. [ Sighs ]
Jump in
Let's go
Lay back
Enjoy the show
Jump in
Let's go
These are the days when anything goes
- [ Kids Yelling ]
- Every day is a winding road
- [ Al ] Got another one!
- I get a little bit closer
Every day is a better sign
- Hey, George! Where do you think you're goin'?
- I get a little bit closer
- To feelin' fine
- [ George ] You guys going home?
- You want a ride?
- Okay.
- Glory!
- What?
Glory, come on.
- Would you come on?
- All right.
- Al!
- Okay. I'm coming.
Hurry up.
- Jump in
Let's go
- Move over.
Ouch!
These are the days when anything goes
Every day is a winding road
- I'm feelin' fine
- Are those for our mom?
Yup.
I thought flowers were for dates.
[ Laughs ]
Don't get spooky, Al.
Did she invite you?
Hey, wait a minute!
Blue. I don't have blue.
Every day is a winding road
- Every day is a winding road
- Oh, great.
Every day is a winding road
- You guys know the name of this, uh-- this flower?
- No.
- No.
- A Delphinium belladonna.
That's the Ranunculaceae family.
I didn't always know the names of flowers, but it seems, recently, that I can pretty much name any flower I see.
Yeah. Like this one is Lamonium sabbatom.
And, uh, this is the, uh--
[ Chuckles ]
Doesn't make 'em any prettier, though.
- Is that a garbage bag tie?
- Yeah.
I was improvising.
Hey, now that's a good idea.
- Ah, that's much better.
- Yup.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Every day is a winding road
Every day is a winding road
My mom's around back!
Every day is a winding road
Lace?
Hi.
- Hi.
- Now, you didn't nearly take enough tomatoes.
And I'm very proud of them.
Uh, well, there you go.
And, uh...
I got you these.
Uh, well, that's every wildflower from my house to your house.
Your kids helped.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you working on?
- Nah, nothing. Nothing.
- Look at this. Wow. That's--
That's really great work.
- [ Kids Giggling ]
- Look at this. Beautiful.
- Uh, you want to, uh, walk?
- Sure.
- [ Glory ] Shh.
I-- I gotta tell you, you-- you got great kids.
Yeah, they are great kids.
But you don't really know that yet,
George, because you don't know them... and you don't know me.
- Well, I'm tryin' to get to know you.
- I know.
I-I really want to keep my life very simple.
Even predictable.
That's why I moved here.
I don't like surprises, and I don't like complications.
What happened to you, Lace?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Th-That's none of my business.
- No, no. It's okay.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
So, let me ask you something, George.
When a man comes over with a basket full of tomatoes, what is he expecting?
- Dinner?
- No, no, no.
Just hoping.
Charlock folium.
Look at--
Uh, you don't have any purple in those flowers I got you, do you?
Whoa. Did you--
Did you feel that?
- Feel what?
- Uh... oh!
Uh--
Uh, uh, come here.
Come here. Let's see.
- Okay.
- Feel that, right there.
Feel what?
Oh, God. I think
I know what this is.
- What?
- C-C-Can I use your phone?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Just east of Harmon. Do you know which one I'm talking about?
No. I-I-I was told to call you, and-- and I'm telling you right now... that I picked up on some activity.
No, we didn't use any instrumentation.
No, I don't have a degree, and I haven't studied anywhere, but I'm just trying to--
Are you shutting me down here?
Is that what's going on?
Are you trying to shut me down?
Look, I'm just trying to tell you that
I felt the compression waves, okay?
ULF, ultralow frequency waves.
N-N-Now, they have the ability to make you nauseous and-- and dizzy. Am I right?
Okay. Well, that's what I felt.
And-- And I'm trying to tell you...
- th-that I think that there--
- [ Phone Disconnects ]
There's an earthquake coming.
Um, listen, Al. Why don't you put some masking tape on the cupboards?
- And, Glory, bring the vases down, and the china.
- Okay.
This is good, Lace.
- I think you're a good cook.
- No, I'm not.
I only make two things pretty well-- pork chops and, um, turkey.
Which is this?
[ Laughing ]
I'm-- I'm just--
- [ Dishes Rattling ]
- Look!
[ Gasps ]
Al!
- Oh, you!
- [ Laughing ] I was just joking.
- [ Lace ] Oh, please!
- [ Everyone Laughing ]
Oh, you scared me!
[ Exhales ]
- Not funny.
- [ Chuckling ]
[ Clears Throat ]
- Outside?
- Thanks.
- All right. Can I say it now?
- What's that?
- You've got great kids.
- Oh, thanks.
- And I thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.
- And good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Yeah.
Shh. She's coming.
- Tell her.
- You tell her.
- Shh.
- [ Clears Throat ]
- He's neat.
- Yeah, he's nice, isn't he?
Yeah, but he thinks he saw a UFO, and he thinks he can predict earthquakes.
There may be a warning here.
But he never said for sure it was a UFO
[ Rumbling ]
Oh, Jesus!
Doorway, doorway!
Let's get in the truck.
Get in the truck!
- It's over, Mom.
- I know it's over. Let's go! Now!
- [ Attila Barking ]
- Did you feel it? Huh?
- Did you get scared? Huh?
- [ Whining ]
Do you realize the possibilities of this? Huh?
- [ Truck Approaching ]
- Do you know what this means?
You felt it, didn't you?
- You did!
- What is going on, George?
- Wasn't that amazing?
- Tell me what's happening.
I don't know!
I don't-- I don't know!
I need the simple truth, George.
This is the truth. Wh-Wh-What's happening to me i-is the truth.
Oh, no.
[ Exhales ]
Lace.
I love those chairs, Lace.
I love them.
I did--
Y-You made them.
Okay? All right?
I-I wanted to see you.
Okay?
Bring them back to your shop tomorrow.
- I'll give you your money back.
- I don't want my money back, Lace.
I just asked you for one thing, George. The truth.
And you couldn't handle it.
[ Nate ] George, haven't you called her yet?
Never mind about that now, will you?
Now, this is the second one.
- Gladiolus. Remember that.
- How do you know she's still mad at you?
- I know. Now. All right.
- Write her a note.
No, no. I found this.
Classic five-bed garden pattern.
Flowers. You should send her flowers or candy.
Yeah. Marigolds, gladiolas, roses, et cetera.
And I went to the library, and I looked up the missile silo pattern... at the Masterson Air Force Base.
I made my-- my own overlay.
And here we go.
- There.
- Yeah.
See, that's their-- that's their garden. You see?
Well, that's old stuff, and it's-- it's, uh, declassified. But now, this--
This stuff is trickier.
This is, uh, trigraphs and tetragraphs and ABBA class.
- George. [ Sighs ]
- Yep?
- Well, you just tell me what you want me to send.
- Right.
Okay, send this.
Why don't you send this?
'Mind your garden. Frost coming. Luck on the Mozop.'
- Wanna know what 'Mozop' is?
- That's okay. It's your game, George.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, you sat in this chair yet?
- It's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.
- You should give her a call right now.
- Nah. Let her cool off.
- [ Radio Beeping ]
- I figure I'll give her about a year.
- [ Chuckles ]
Pick up the phone and call her, George.
Look who's talkin'.
Diana Ross fan club.
Have you said ten words to a woman this year?
Ah, I'm sorry, Nate.
Your transmission's finished, sir.
I've just been goin' through some things lately.
Everybody's goin' through something.
I know, but, uh--
This thing's been hard for me to handle.
Let me show you something.
[ Exhales ]
You suppose they magnetized you?
I don't know, buddy.
I wish I did.
- [ Doc ] What've we got here?
- Hurry up! Get in there.
[ All Chattering ]
- [ Man ] Dor na barriga.
- One of you go to the garbage... and bring me any food containers you find.
- [ Muttering In Portuguese ]
- Somebody else go in the cabinets... and look for damaged or swollen cans.
- Food poisoning.
- I think.
- [ Muttering ]
- Now, what the hell is he saying? Who speaks Spanish?
[ Woman ] That's Portuguese.
They just came in last week.
- Portuguese?
- Berto, onde esta?
He's trying to tell us something about Berto.
- [ Groaning ]
- That's the little one.
It's a little boy.
All right, some of you search around here for the kid.
I'm gonna tell you right now he could be pretty darn sick.
Now, Bonnie, wait.
Uh--
Get on the phone and get
George Malley over here.
Tell him what's going on and tell him to stop at the library for a English-Portuguese book.
Tell him to find out how to ask where a lost boy is. Got that?
- George Malley?
- You bet. [ Chuckles ]
George. Go on, do it.
Just go on. Go on!
[ Phone Ringing ]
- Don't you answer that?
- Not when I'm working.
I been farmin' all my life,
- [ Ringing Continues ]
- but this growth is amazing, George.
[ Laughs ]
This is embarrassing.
You know, I want to try this fertilizer in your south 40.
You just sprayed my boots.
It's the worst soil in the county.
I can't even get weeds to grow in that field.
But I bet we can get corn to grow in that field.
You bet? You don't have any money to bet.
You spent all your money on chairs, remember?
[ Vehicle Approaching ]
[ Attila Barks ]
- George Malley?
- Yeah, I'm George Malley.
I-I'm John Ringold.
We talked on the phone the other day.
- John Ringold? From Berkeley?
- Yes. Yes.
- [ Laughs ] Right! Hi.
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm glad you came by.
- Will your dog let me step out?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he just has a thing for seismologists.
Now, come on out.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, this is my friend, Nate Pope.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- L-Let me get you a cold drink. Come on in.
- From the university, huh?
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.
And, uh, we are very interested in how you were able to predict that earthquake, Mr.Malley.
Oh, that.
You see, I-I just picked up the subsonic frequency waves, right?
And, of course, I was standing on the fault, so that made it easier.
- What instrumentation did you use?
- Just me.
If you think that's something, you should see him move stuff with his brain.
Nate! Never mind that. You see,
I felt the ultralow frequency waves.
And they kind of made me dizzy and nauseous, right? And that's how I perceived all this.
We've been studying quake prediction for ten years.
There's no record of any person ever feeling the prequake activity.
Now there is.
We have some ULF equipment in our labs.
Could you come in for an experiment?
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.
[ Laughs ]
Yes.
Well, my department would like to interview you and clear this up.
I-I would be-- I would be so glad to come to Berkeley.
D-Do you think that I could meet with-- with some other departments as well?
I-I have some experiments that
I'd like to show you. Come with me.
They're nice.
All right.
Well, uh, let's see.
Um. Oh, oh, yes, here.
Okay, now, look, um--
I've taken solar panels, and I've actually germinated the seeds... th-that made these-- th-th-these plants grow.
I'm trying to change the electromagnetic field, right?
- Uh, Mr.Malley?
- I took, uh, incandescent light...
- Mr.Malley.
- and turned it into sunlight, which actually made these-- these plants grow.
- Mr.Malley.
- Oh. Now look,
I-I-I took pig manure... and I turned it into a fuel, which I-I believe will actually run an automobile.
All I'm interested in is the earthquake.
We need to know if that was a fluke.
A coincidence.
A fluke?
George, why don't you move something with your mind?
Maybe move his, uh-- [ Mouthing Word ] or something like that?
- Look, Mr.Ringold.
- Doctor.
D-Dr.Ringold, uh, look--
I--
Look. I-- I've got-- I've got my garden out there, and that acts like a lab, right?
- And I've got-- And I've got everything that you see here.
- [ Vehicle Approaching ]
- But I-- I really need to talk to people like you, okay?
- [ Tito ] Hey, George!
- [ Horn Honking ]
- [ Shouting ] George! Are you home?
- Please don't go, okay?
Just please don't go.
- George, get out here!
- [ Honking ]
- Hey, George!
George! Doc says you better come right now!
- What's the matter?
- Come on, man! It's an emergency!
You gotta learn how to talk Portuguese on the way over there.
I gotta go.
Portuguese?
- Learn Portuguese?
- Why don't you go along, Professor?
George! Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.
[ Man ]
Hey, George.
- Hey, Doc. George is here.
- [ Sighs ]
He's gonna be fine, George, but his grandson is missing.
Now, if they ate the same thing, the boy could be a lot worse off.
- You brought the book?
- Yeah, I have it.
Okay. Ask him where the boy is.
Onde esta o menino?
- Va ao pomar.
- He's in orchard.
He said, 'He's in the orchard.'
- Right. Okay.
- [ George ] Diga.
[ Patient ]
Meu neto, Alberto.
- Uma coisa que eu comi.
- Mmm.
Eu tenho medo. Vao depressa achar o Alberto. Depressa!
He said that they ate something bad, and he thinks the boy-- the boy is sick.
Calma. Eles irao encontrar o menino.
O doutor vai dar uma coisa para ficar melhor.
Calma, calma.
Obrigado. Obrigado.
Tito drove the truck while I-I read the book.
George Malley! You learned the Portuguese language in 20 minutes?
Not all of it.
- What are we lookin' for here? A kid?
- [ Tito ] What's the kid's name?
- Alberto.
- Berto. Alberto. Yeah.
Alberto.
Now, let's spread out and comb these-- comb these trees.
- Everybody, let's go.
Look real careful.
- Okay.
- Call out his name.
- [ All Shouting ] Alberto!
[ Everyone ]
Boy! Alberto! Alberto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!
Berto!
[ All Shouting ]
Where are you, kid?
Alberto? Wherever you are, we're coming.
[ Calling Continues ]
[ Moans ]
George, what you got?
- [ Moans ]
- Huh? What?
- He's not in the orchard.
- Oh.
- He's sick, Doc.
- Oh.
Mmm.
- He's there.
- Where is he, George? Where?
- Over here.
- Okay. That's good.
We're with you.
We're with you.
[ Tito ]
What's goin' on?
- Oh. Ohh.
- [ Doc ] You okay, George?
It's not me, it's him.
[ Moans ]
Tell me where he is.
[ George ]
I don't know! I don't know.
[ Moaning ]
[ Rattling ]
Dios mio!
[ Moaning ]
[ Tito ]
Look! There's a ladder under there!
Come on.
He was right! Vayamos!
He's up here!
Doc? You better get up here fast.
Good work, George.
[ Groans ]
So is, uh, Wednesday good for you? Say 2:00?
- Sure, Wednesday is good.
- Should I send a car?
No, no, John.
I'll get there on my own.
And I'll have somebody from solar energy there.
- And, uh, anything else?
- Yeah, automotive.
- D-D-Do you have an agricultural school at Berkeley?
- Yeah.
Well, how about for my fertilizer?
- I'll take care of it.
- [ Laughs ]
Hey, George.
Esa mujer con Doc.
- That's the little boy's mom.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]
She's the only woman talks English, I think.
Oh. It's too bad she wasn't here earlier, huh?
Yeah. But--
I guess she had to look for work, man.
I want you to meet a very special guy.
This is the man who-- who found your son. Okay?
Very special.
This is George Malley.
- This is Ella.
- Hello.
[ Crying ]
- Thank you.
- It's okay.
Thank you.
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?
Thank you, George.
- Way to go, patron.
- Do you know what kind of work she was lookin' for?
Mmm. Cook, I think they say. Housekeeper.
Por que? You know somebody who's looking?
- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.
I found a housekeeper for you.
A Portuguese woman. She cooks too.
I think she's perfect for you.
I don't know if I could eat
Portuguese food, George.
Well, she'll cook you anything you want, Nate.
She'll try to make sense of that so-called house that you live in.
- She speak English?
- Oh, a bit. But, uh--
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna work on your Portuguese.
- Me?
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
No, no. It's, uh-- I don't know if that's gonna work, George.
All right. Well, let's try it.
What do you wanna say?
How about, uh, something like, um, um,
'Can you come twice a week?'
Okay. Can you come twice a week?
Okay. Can you come twice a week?
[ In Portuguese ]
You are more beautiful than music.
That sounds complicated, George.
Oh, no! You got your tape recorder and-- and, uh, you'll learn it phonetically.
No problem.
What else?
- Uh, 'How much per day?'
- How much-- Okay. Good.
How much per day?
[ In Portuguese ]
Your face is like a poem.
- I like that one. That one's nice.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What else?
- Okay, okay. Uh--
- Uh, 'Can you start next week?'
- Perfect. Logical, right? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can you start next week?
[ In Portuguese ]
And in your eyes... heaven.
- Beautiful language, huh?
- That's it?
Yep. Work on those.
Yep. Work on those.
You know, George,
I might be pretty good at Portuguese.
[ Coyote Howling ]
[ Howling Continues ]
No. Oh, never mind.
We'll get used to 'em.
If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
It's a good arrangement.
- What are we reading?
- This.
What is this?
Where did you get this?
- From me.
- Oh, this is not a good choice for bedtime.
- Are you still mad at him?
- [ Sighs ] What's the difference?
He's neat, and they say he saved that boy's life at the orchard.
- He's funny.
- We are funny enough.
We laugh all the time.
[ Groans ]
Look, we're reading Black Beauty, and we are not talking about men.
I've got enough to worry about.
Too much.
- [ Al ] What?
- Well, you guys, for one.
We're not little anymore.
I know you're not little anymore, sweetie. But you think that George Malley is safe, and you're afraid of coyotes.
You've got it all backwards.
Here. Find our place.
Go brush your teeth.
I'll be right back. Don't you have a report to do?
Did it.
Ohh. [ Muttering ]
'They're everywhere.'
Oh, Al! Do you really believe this?
Yeah. There's been a lot of UFO people coming into town... since George saw... what he saw.
The word's spreading, Ma.
You just believe what you want to believe. Most people do.
- [ Coyote Howling ]
- You get over it.
Hey, I thought we were getting ready for bed.
No.
[ Sighs ]
- Stop talking about him, all right?
- Why do you hate him?
- [ Exhales ] Because I like him.
- Told you.
[ Mimicking Glory ]
Told you.
But if he was sitting here with us right now, wouldn't you be watching him?
Wondering what's he thinking?
When's he gonna leave?
Is he gonna leave? Hmm?
- We don't need that.
- [ Coyote Howls ]
It's okay. Shh.
- [ Tito ] He found the kid and left--
- I heard he took 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes, he read the whole damn book, knew Portuguese.
- [ Man ] You were there!
- [ Woman ] He went running around in the orchard.
[ Jimmy ] Shh. Here he comes.
Here he comes.
- [ Jimmy ] Hey, George.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- [ Sighs ]
- So, George.
How'd you feel that earthquake comin'?
- Voices tell you?
- Voices? Hell, no.
What else do you know, George?
Well, I know you're on the outs with Lisa again.
- How did you know that?
- Well, 'cause when she's livin' with you,
- she makes sure your clothes match.
- [ Laughs ]
- [ Man ] Poor Banes.
- Do you get messages, George?
Yeah. Well, yeah. When, uh,
Paulette delivers the mail, I do.
But today she was two hours late.
I think we ought to do something about that.
Complain or something.
- Earthquake. Earthquake. Can we--
- Well, you know, Jimmy.
It was just-- I was out by Ash Creek, and I felt some vibrations, that's all.
- How'd you know where to find the boy in that orchard?
- Oh, I don't know, Bonnie.
- Come on.
- Do you know what's going to happen?
Roger! Come on.
I'm sorry, I--
They say at the library you read four books a day now.
Yeah, well, that was last week, and--
[ Sighs ]
I-- I better go.
How many languages do you speak now?
- Excusez-moi, Jimmy.
- Huh?
If anything bad was gonna happen, you'd tell us.
Won't you? Hey!
[ Women Chattering ]
- All right.
- Excuse me?
- Hi, Lace.
- Hello.
I'm sorry I lied to you about the chairs.
I-I just wanted you to come to my shop... so-- so you would talk to me.
Instead of, um-- Instead of always walking away from me.
What do you want, George?
I want you to come to Berkeley with me. I-I've been invited to talk to, uh, some scientists... about the earthquake thing and about some of my-- my experiments.
You know, the-- the fertilizer and the solar panels and--
- That's really nice.
- I'm excited, but I--
I guess I'm scared too.
I sure would like you there with me.
- What for?
- Support.
Confidence. A friend.
You've got friends. You know everyone in the whole area code.
I don't know. You know, since that orchard thing, it--
People are different now.
They're-- I don't like it.
[ Chuckling ] You know, the-- the funny thing is-- is that... you're probably the only one that-- that-- that's mad at me for a good reason.
You're just tryin' to make up.
Yes. I'm tryin' to make up with you.
I am tryin' to get a date with you.
And I would love it if you stood by me while all those scientists... and teachers ask me questions.
You know, I-I spent half of school in detention.
- [ Scoffs ]
- [ Laughs ]
- When?
- Wednesday.
- What time?
- Leave about noon.
I'll be outside your shop at noon if I'm coming.
And if I'm not there--
Okay. Thanks, Lace.
[ Exhales ]
- [ Diana Ross, Muffled ]
- [ Nate ] Touch
Me in the morning
Then just walk away
[ Knock At Door ]
We don't have tomorrow
Uh... one second.
One second.
Here I come.
You are Mr.Pope?
You are Mr.Pope?
I am Michaela.
'Mick-Ella.' Mm?
- You're Ella?
- [ Chuckling ] Uh, yes.
[ Chuckles ]
Wow.
- Oh. I-I'm sorry. Please.
- Oh. Um. Maybe you need to--
- [ Ella ] Yes, this is the place.
- [ Nate Chuckles ]
- I cook too. You need cooking?
- Cooking.
- Yeah. [ Laughs ]
- Good. Fine. Good.
- Um, how much you pay?
- Uh, I--
Oh, wait.
Uh, I-I-I speak a little Portuguese.
Oh, muito bem!
Assim vamos entender-nos.
- [ Laughs ]
- Uh, aonde aprendeu portugues?
[ Chuckling ] I don't know what you just said, but it sounded great.
- [ Laughs ] Um--
- Sorry.
Okay, uh, tomorrow
I come back.
9:00. Okay?
I work, and we talk about money.
No, wait.
Es mais bonita do que uma sinfonia.
That's all I really know.
That and, um--
Teu rosto e um poema.
E teus olhos, o ceu.
Is that right?
[ Laughs ]
You're cute.
- Tomorrow.
- Mm.
Tomorrow, then.
CQ. CQ.
This is WB6QLF.
Diana, if you can hear me,
I know you'll understand this.
I just met... an angel... from Portugal.
Here.
In my house.
[ Police Dispatcher On Radio ]
You George Malley?
Jack Hatch, FBI.
Nate Pope sent a coded message to Masterson Air Force Base.
No, no, no. Nate-- Nate Pope did not send a coded message to the air force base.
- I-I did.
- Well, who taught you the cipher, Mr.Malley?
Nobody. I just broke-- broke the code.
- Who trained you?
- As I said, nobody. I--
[ Groans ]
Oh, man.
Mm-hmm.
[ Electronic Beeping ]
Well?
[ Clears Throat ]
Can't do it.
You can do it, Mr.Malley.
Too complex.
We're releasing Nathan Pope.
[ Sighs ] It's about time.
Can I talk to him?
[ Official ] No.
Try this one.
You know, i-it was just a game, okay? I mean, a game.
You caused the cancellation of a top secret training exercise, Mr.Malley.
The scrapping of an entire cipher system.
You cost the government a lot of money.
[ Sighs ] So bill me.
- [ Electronic Beeping ]
- [ Sighs ]
[ Woman ] I think he's what he says he is-- a fluke.
- He's an independent, playing some kind of genius games.
- I want him tested.
- Can't keep holdin' him.
- Yes, we can.
- He resisted arrest.
- No, he didn't.
Yes. He did.
Test him.
All right. I'll start the questions, and I'll be timing your responses.
And we'll be recording.
Any questions?
- What's your first name?
- Uh, my first name is Bob.
- [ Chuckles ] Hi.
- Shoot, Bob.
Right.
Name as many mammals as you can in 60 seconds.
- Ready? Go.
- [ Stopwatch Beeps ]
Hmm. Sixty seconds.
Well, how would you like that?
How about alphabetical?
Aardvark, baboon, caribou, dolphin, eohippus, fox, gorilla, hyena, ibex, jackal, kangaroo, lion, marmoset, Newfoundland, ocelot, panda, rat, sloth, tiger, unicorn, varmint, whale, yak, zebra.
Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland.
That's a dog breed.
Unicorn is mythical; eohippus is prehistoric.
But you weren't being very specific, now, were you, Bob?
- [ Watch Beeps ]
- [ Chuckles ]
Well. Uh, I'll--
I'll try to be more specific.
- Ready for the next one?
- Shoot.
Answer as quickly as you can.
- How old is a person born in 1928?
- [ Beep ]
- Man or woman?
- [ Beep ]
Why?
- Specifics, Bob.
- Okay. One more time.
- How old is a man born in 1928?
- [ Beep ]
- Still alive?
- [ Beep ]
If a man is born in 1928...
- and he's still alive, how old is he?
- [ Beep ]
- What month?
- [ Beep ]
If a man was born...
October 3, 1928,
- and he's still alive, how old is he?
- [ Beep ]
- What time?
- [ Beep ]
- 10:00... p.m.
- [ Beep ]
- Where?
- [ Beep ]
- Anywhere!
Well, let's get specific, Bob.
I mean, if the guy's still alive, born in California,
October 3, 1928, he's 67 years, 9 months,
22 days, 14 hours and-- and 12 minutes.
If he's born in New York, he's three hours older, now, isn't he?
Mmm.
[ Grunts ]
How do you do that?
How do you-- How do you make that pencil move?
Is that a trick pencil?
No. I ask it to move.
I mean, I could say that I will it, but that would be more like a command.
This is more like a collaboration, a partnership.
- Partnership?
- Mm-hmm.
- With a pencil.
- Well, why not?
We're all made up of the same stuff, aren't we?
- Wood?
- Energy, Bob.
- You know, the little pieces.
- Right, yeah.
I wanna go home. How the hell can I get home, Bob?
I don't know. Sorry.
Hey.
- They say you haven't slept.
- Mm.
Who's that?
My keepers?
I'm all right.
You know, you're a pretty gifted man,
Mr.Malley.
- [ Scoffs ]
- No, no, really. We were hopin'--
Well, I was kind of hopin' that you might find something that you enjoy doing.
Something useful in our world.
- Your world?
- Intelligence.
Ah, no, no, no.
It's home for me, Jack.
I'm jumpin' out of my skin here.
I mean, I want my life.
I-I want my life.
[ Sighs ]
What do you want?
- It's not what I want.
- What do they want?
They want to feel safe.
They don't feel safe with you out there.
Whoa. Why would they? They've been havin' me break codes all night.
Secret codes.
I mean-- There--
I shouldn't be listening to a code from Britain to Saudi Arabia.
These are our allies! I-If you guys are gonna accuse me of a crime... or keep me here, uh, I'll tell the press.
Or I'll call London or Riyadh.
I know all the, uh, capitals now, by the way.
You can test me.
My interest in Mr.Malley has to do with seismology and geology.
It has nothing to do with security issues.
Oh, I know. But that's not the point. Mr.Malley has been released without charges.
But he is considered a security risk.
I'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.
We'd feel better, for the time being, if he wasn't granted any access to the institutions... where sensitive government projects are in the works.
- Access?
- Access even to personnel.
[ Knock At Door ]
- [ George ] Lace!
- Oh.
- I-It's me.
- [ Sighs ]
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry I-- I didn't come through the front door,
- but I was so afraid
I'd wake the kids.
- Oh, that's okay. That's okay.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I wanted to see you.
- [ Sighs ]
Nate told me about the FBI.
- [ Groans ]
- I'm so glad they let you go.
- Yeah, well, they had no choice.
But they-- they are watching me so closely.
I think I scare them.
You scare me too.
I do?
Hmm.
[ Sniffles ]
Listen, George.
It's getting really complicated. I just--
I just don't know what's gonna happen next.
I should probably leave you alone, shouldn't I?
I-- I guess so.
I'll see you.
[ Whispers ]
Good-bye.
[ Sighs ]
Hey.
- You want a beer, George?
- Yup.
Look, Nate.
I am really sorry for what happened. Okay?
I told them everything, George.
I told them everything about you. Everything.
Well, you know, that's supposed to happen. Okay?
- I mean, you know, it's, uh--
- You just think you're not gonna be so scared.
And you're just sittin' there.
You don't know what's gonna happen.
And then all of a sudden, something happens inside you, right?
You don't know what it is, but--
It's all right.
I-It was my game. You know?
What'd they do to you, George?
[ Exhales ]
They tested me.
Wh-What'd they find out?
[ Sighs ]
I'm pregnant.
- [ Chuckles ]
- That's how it feels.
- How what feels?
- You know, to be full of ideas and you can't deliver. Okay?
I mean, you know, you're ready to break out, and you can't deliver!
Y-You know, uh, this professor, he won't even talk to me.
He won't even talk to me.
- You're not going to Berkeley, George?
- Come on. Me at Berkeley?
- That's a thought, huh?
- I'm sorry, buddy.
You mean inventions?
You got inventions?
No, no, ideas. Okay?
I got a thousand ideas a day.
E-Every d-damn minute! Okay?
B-Big 'holy cow' kind of ideas.
And little 'what if' ideas, all right?
I-I got you-- ideas for you,
Jimmy. Look at this.
Look at this. Your parking lot.
It's laid out all wrong, okay?
Now, if you just follow this, right?
You can put six more cars in, and nobody gets fender benders.
All right? Where's Paulette?
Where is she?
Bonnie. Here. Take this.
It's a new route for her mail, okay?
Now, if she does this, she can save an hour a day and everybody gets their mail by 3:00.
Imagine! 3:00. Oh, and I got a 'holy shit' idea too. Look at this.
Now, this may be the most efficient way to store solar energy. Okay? Take it!
- Well, what am I gonna do with it?
- What the hell... am I supposed to do with it, huh?
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?
- Tell us. Well, tell us!
- I'm gonna tell you what it was.
- It was a damn alien!
- Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.
- I know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was!
Don't say that!
- Well, tell us!
- It's a goddamn mistake is what it is!
Okay? It was supposed to happen to someone smart.
Someone-- Someone scientific.
Someone who's a leader.
But it didn't. It happened to me, George freakin' Malley!
Look at him!
Now, look at him! Look!
[ Sighs ]
Jimmy.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, i-it's all right.
- I-I-I'll pay for it.
- All right.
Bonnie. Bonnie, please.
I-It's okay.
Oh, man.
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
- Who was that? A customer?
It's Banes. He says he can't work here no more.
Sorry.
Well, why didn't he talk to me?
Little bit scared, I guess.
- Jesus Christ.
- Look, George. It'll wear off.
They'll forget. Their cars are gonna break down--
- Hi.
- Hey, Doc.
Hi.
Energy vibrations?
What is it?
- I don't know.
- Telekinesis? What?
- Yeah, maybe. Uh, maybe, yeah.
- Think it's gettin out of hand?
Look, look. I-- I was mad, all right? I was pissed off, and I'm not mad now, okay?
Good. I'll sound the all clear, call off the paratroopers. [ Laughs ]
Jesus, George.
Now, listen.
- You owe me a CAT scan.
I want more blood.
- Mm-hmm.
- Also, you look like hell.
- Aah. That's good. Doc, what's the matter with everybody?
They won't give me a chance to explain anything.
I look-- I look at them, and they-- they look at me like
I'm a green bug or something!
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look! I have an idea.
Now, you look at this.
Now, look at this.
Now, look at that. Now, I-I'm a big deal at the Harmon library.
I-I can take up to 30 books a night. Okay?
And I told them I'd be part of this.
I said that I-I'd put out a table.
- Pressure is way up there.
- Then I would sit there, and they could ask me questions.
You know, 'Meet George Malley.'
What do you think?
- Uh, like a circus attraction.
- Oh, God, Doc. Please?
You know, I-- See, I-I can explain to them once and for all.
I-I could share my ideas with them. Y-You know. And then I-I could get my life back together.
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt. Okay?
And do like I told you all your life:
Breathe in and out. Okay, George?
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
[ Breathing Heavily ]
[ Wind Whistling ]
- [ Glory ] Come on, give it.
- [ Al ] No.
- Give it! Come on!
- No! You're not careful.
You'll break it.
- Al! What've you got there?
- [ Glory ] Please,
I just wanna look at it.
Hey. That's dangerous, sweetie.
- He bought it.
- What?
It's a piece of the mirror George broke.
Richard Smick is selling them at school.
- Oh, you're kidding.
- It's hot! Feel it.
- That's not hot!
- Richard said the aliens probably took George Malley away...
- and put this man in his place.
- This man?
Like he's not human.
That's really dumb.
And it's really mean.
Can't they just look in his eyes and see who he is? Can't you?
Do you remember when Daddy left, how people treated us differently?
Even our so-called friends?
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.
How much you pay for that?
- A... quarter.
- A dollar.
- What's the truth, Al?
- I paid a dollar. I was gonna check it with my magnets.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Do you see something really strange in there?
- What?
- What?
- A sucker.
- No.
- You paid a dollar for nothing.
- You're a goner!
- Nice job, Al! [ Giggles ]
[ Al Arguing,
Glory Giggling ]
Hmm.
Lace.
Hi.
Hi.
I just--
I just called you.
- You did?
- Mmm. Come in. Come in.
- [ Clears Throat ]
- I'm so-- so glad you came.
Well, I was just--
Why-- Why were you calling?
I found some things out, Lace.
Things, uh, are coming clearer to me.
Or at least they're-- they're starting to.
- Things?
- Mmm.
I want to talk to the people, Lace.
I-I don't want them to be scared of me or-- or frightened.
I-I mean, I wanna--
I wanna tell them what I know.
So I've-- I've decided to speak at the library fair.
Do you-- Do you think that they'll listen to me?
What would they do?
[ Chuckles ] Throw stones?
Oh, my God. Please, sit down.
I can't believe this.
- Would you like something to drink? A beer?
- No.
What? What can I get you?
Scissors.
I can hear her heartbeat
From a thousand miles
And the heavens open up
Every time she smiles
And when I come to her
That is where I belong
And I'm runnin' through her
Like a river song
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She's got a fine sense of humor
When I'm feelin' low down
And I'm comin' to her
When the sun goes down
Take away my troubles
Oh, take away my grief
Take away my heartaches
In the night like a thief
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
And I need her in the daytime
I need her
And I need her in the night
I need her
And I wanna throw my arms
- Around her
- Have you done this before?
- Nope.
- Kiss and hug her
Kiss and hug her tight
Ah
Up or down?
- Down.
- When I'm returning
From so far away
Gives me some sweeter lovin'
Brightens up my day
And it makes me righteous
And it makes me whole
And it makes me mellow
Right down to my soul
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
- Love, love
- Is it close enough?
- Love, love
Crazy love
- You tell me.
- You give me love
- Love, love
- Give me love
- Love, love
- Crazy love
- Ah, that's pretty close.
- Love
- Love, love, love, love
Crazy love
- You give me love
- Love, love, love, love
Crazy love
[ Sighs ]
You're running away?
Are you coming back?
Mmm.
Hope so.
- [ Al ] Let me see the popcorn.
- [ Glory ] No.
[ Kids Arguing,
People Chattering ]
Good luck, George.
Oh, hi, Doc.
- Welcome.
- Do you improve your mind with all this reading?
Yes, Doc.
Lady Chatterley's Lover?
- [ Everyone Laughs ]
- Huh?
Yeah. Uh-- All right, well, you know, that's kind of a--
That's kind of a code book for anyone who, uh, wants to understand a woman's heart and mind;
I-I read it twice.
[ Laughter ]
Can you, uh-- Can you name the presidents forwards and backwards for these people?
No. But I can name some, uh, forward presidents and some backward ones.
You know, I-I can really only tell you what I've read in these books.
- He looks better.
- Yeah. Yeah. He does.
[ George ] I seem to have an increased capacity for-- for learning.
- Right now.
- How do we know you've read all these books?
Well, um, ask me something. Uh--
I'd be-- I'd be glad to answer any question that you have, or--
How did you break that mirror, George, without even touching it?
Now, I want to talk to you about that, Banes, because I know-- I know you've been worried about it, and, um--
Okay. Come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely.
I'm gonna--
May I use your glasses?
What you're about to see is not a trick. Okay? I-It's just, um--
Well, l-let's just call it an experiment in energy.
Cool!
- [ George ]
Well, everything there is...
- You getting this? is made up of some living energy, okay?
See, now, all this is-- is, uh-- is kind of a dance... or partnership between the energy coming from me... and the, uh, energy of the plastic.
- Now-- Now, th-th-that's it.
- Well, why can't we do it?
Well, focus. Um, uh, clarity of thought.
I-I don't know.
M-Maybe you can, Banes.
What about the UFOs?
What are they?
- I don't know that either.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!
Um, this power began the night that you saw the object in the sky.
Th-That-- That was a light.
Now-- Now, let me just finish this one thing.
N-Now, we're talking about a partnership.
Do you-- Do you know what the largest living organism in the world is?
Okay. It's a grove of aspen trees in Colorado, acres of aspens.
Okay. Now, they thought they were disconnected, separate.
But, indeed, they found out that they weren't.
That-- That there was one giant organism with the same root system.
Uh, what sort of light was it?
- Now-- Now, that's not unlike us.
- [ Man ] Answer the question!
- We think that-- that--
- Why won't you tell us what you know about the UFOs?
- Can you move the table?
- [ Reporter ] How did you feel when you saw that light?
- I think you know more than you're telling us!
- Now, imagine--
Have you seen the light since the 28th?
- [ UFO Enthusiast ]
Are you hiding something?
- [ Man ] Hey! Come on!
- Just put your hands on my boy.
- It was aliens.
- Move the glasses some more!
- Can you bend spoons?
- We know what you can do.
- Leave George alone!
- Touch the boy!
- Please, he's dying.
- George! George!
- [ People Screaming ]
[ Roaring Sound ]
[ Nate ]
George. George, can you see me?
George. George.
You okay?
[ Roaring Continues ]
[ Zapping ]
Mr.Malley?
Are you all right?
Good to see you.
You look sorrowful.
No.
What's the matter? Can't think of any more tests to give me?
How did you, uh, manage to get your pressure to come down?
Oh, I found my pace.
Simple thing, really.
Hard to explain.
Why, you figure
I'm too thick?
What I figure about you... is that you're stalling.
I'm not stalling, though.
I'm-- I'm waiting.
- For what?
- Reinforcements.
[ Laughs ]
Ah. Yeah.
You pick good people.
You bet.
See, uh--
George. George.
There's a tumor in your brain...
- [ Scoffs ]
- that's spread out like a hand.
Threads of it, you know, everywhere.
But instead of dysfunction--
Now, here's the mystery, George.
Instead of destroying brain function, so far, it's been stimulating it.
And we can't understand that.
You have more area of active brain use than anybody ever tested.
Ever. B-Because of those tentacles.
I mean, we've seen tumors like this before.
It's called astrocytoma.
And it explains the-- the dizziness and... the illusion of light.
But the way it's in there, waking up areas of the brain, it's a... big mystery, so--
And it's killing me.
- Well, uh--
- For sure?
We got a call from the best brain man in the country.
I mean, actually he's one of the best in the world.
He's gonna study your tests and then talk to you.
But, uh, the blood flow is in danger now.
And, uh, you're gonna start to weaken, maybe... black out.
We-- We really don't know.
It's--
But it's a damn lousy scenario, you see.
[ Sighs ]
Let me sit down here a minute.
[ Sighs ]
Goddamn it.
S-Something happened about 25 years ago... when you broke your leg and I set it, George.
I don't know what to call it. But, uh--
Somehow you got into my heart more than most.
And for--
[ Choking Up ]
And for a man who's never been a father,
I sure feel like I'm losing a son.
[ Doc ] Yeah.
Georgie. Yeah.
[ Nate ] Can I do something for you, George?
- Anything?
- Yes.
Next spring, when you plant the south 40,
I want you to use the new fertilizer.
I want you to put corn in that field.
And I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking... that it's just too tough a-a crop, but it's not.
I'm telling you.
You'll get four to five years... without rotation.
Now, trust me on this.
Okay.
I'm gonna wait outside.
- Okay.
- Doc, you wanna... come with me?
Yeah. Okay.
Bye, Doc.
Now, uh, he didn't say how long.
Days or weeks.
They don't--
They don't know.
I'm so sorry, Lace.
I know how you hate surprises.
[ Laughs ] I tried so hard not to love you.
- How'd you make out?
- Terrible.
Hey. Would you, uh, love me the rest of my life?
Nah. I'm gonna love you for the rest of mine.
George Malley?
I'm Dr.Wellin.
George, I'm recording this because I'm going to be asking you...
- some very important questions.
- Mm.
- You ready?
- Not another test.
No. No, no.
No more tests.
A dialogue.
I'm going to ask for your permission for my team to perform open-brain surgery.
- [ Murmurs ]
- But I don't want you to answer...
- 'til we've had our dialogue.
- B-B-But y-you said that this tumor was inoperable.
I think the odds are very small, say, one in five hundred, that we'd be able to remove enough of the tumor to even prolong your life.
- Well, why-- why--
- But what I want to explain... is that this would not be a lifesaving operation.
[ Inhales ]
This would be--
Call it an expedition.
This would be a voyage of discovery.
You're in a position to contribute as much to our knowledge... as any man or woman who's come before you.
And if you were to wait, and, uh, do this operation... after I'm done with my brain, what would, uh--
If that's what you want, yes, an autopsy. That's all we'll do.
But that wouldn't be as useful.
The study of a living, active brain would tell us volumes.
All right, so, if you were to do this operation, wouldn't it most likely kill me... or at least shorten my life?
George, I-- I'm asking you to try and see the larger picture.
- Mm-hmm.
- To realize what you have... to offer to us, the ones you're leaving behind.
You could be our greatest teacher, George.
Hmm?
I can be your biographer, in a sense.
I can present you to the world.
But that's not me.
That's just my brain.
Do you understand?
Look, Doctor.
You know, I just might have something to say in my last few hours.
I just might have something to say.
What you're saying is that
I have something to teach.
And yet you're willing to end me to study my brain under a microscope.
- N-Now, is that all I'm here for?
- What else?
- You're not a scholar or a--
- I'll tell you what I am, okay?
I-I'll tell you what I think I am.
I think I'm what everybody can be.
- Everyone with a malignant, tentacled--
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I-It's-- It's-- Th-Th-That just helped me get here, okay?
I mean, anybody can get here. It's--
I'm-- I'm the possibility, all right?
I mean, I think you've got this desperate grasp on, uh, technology... and this grasp on science, and, uh, you don't have a-- a hand left to-- to grasp what's important.
- George, now, George--
- If I had to choose between a tumor that got me here... and some flash of light from an alien craft,
I'd choose the tumor; I would, because it's here within us.
What I'm talking about is the human spirit.
That's the challenge.
That's the voyage.
That's the expedition.
You need to go now.
I need my rest, and, uh, I wanna go home.
[ People Chattering ]
Hey, hey, hey.
- I tried to release my patient.
Now, what's going on?
- It's done.
- What's done?
- We didn't feel George Malley was competent to make the decision.
He's a surgical patient now.
Oh, what did you tell the judge?
That you could save him?
- I might prolong his life, yes.
- Bullshit.
If he were rational, he'd say yes.
You know he would.
Now I know why you guys wear masks.
[ Banes ] Yeah, if it was light enough, he could have been blowing on it with his breath.
You know, he could've had a string.
So thin, you know, like, uh, catgut.
He could've had it on his finger and on the glasses, and he could've made it move that way.
[ Roger ] Don't you think he-- he could've, uh, thrown s-something at that mirror somehow? We just--
We just didn't see it.
- [ Jimmy ] No way.
- That quake could've been a coincidence.
He just thought he knew stuff.
I mean, he just studied harder on the Spanish, that's all.
It's not like he really knew stuff.
Just studied hard at chess... and made us think he was changing.
But-- You know, I mean, he never really changed at all. Isn't that right, Doc?
I mean, he never really got any smarter. [ Chuckles ]
- Doc?
- Banes.
How's your lady love?
[ Clears Throat ]
We, uh-- We broke up.
Oh. Really?
That's too bad.
Yeah. Now, George, he's got a love at his side, and she's stickin' with him.
You know why? Because he bought her chairs.
That's pretty smart to me.
You ever buy Lisa's chairs?
[ Laughs ] God, Doc's really drunk tonight. God!
Every woman has her chairs. Something she needs to put herself into, Banes.
You ever figure out what
Lisa's chairs were and buy 'em?
Nope.
[ Chuckles ]
But you're right about one thing.
George never changed.
Never. No, never.
- Doc's makin' no sense tonight.
- Yeah. Maybe he caught it from George.
- Now, goddamn it, Doc!
- Why do you have to tear him down?
What are you so afraid of?
What have you got to lose?
He wasn't selling anything!
He didn't want anything from anybody!
He wanted nothing from nobody!
Nothing! Nothing!
And you people have to tear him down so you can sleep better tonight?
So you can prove that the world is flat? And sleep better tonight? Am I right?
I'm right.
To hell with all of you.
To hell with every one of you.
[ Woman On P.A. ]
Dr.Robinson--
Hey, George. How you doin'?
Here you go.
- Drink up.
- All right.
Good job.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't take the pudding. That's the good part.
- [ Laughs ]
- Hey, is Cal around?
Sure. You wanna see him?
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay.
- Hey, dude. How's it goin'?
- Hey, man. All right.
- Can you stay for a few minutes?
- Sure.
- Saved you some pudding again.
- Oh, what a buddy.
I love this stuff.
Night, dude.
- [ Radio Dispatcher Chattering ]
- Hey, Doc. You seen him?
- Seen who? What?
- George Malley. He's out.
He sneaked out.
- We're lookin' all over for him.
- He's out?
Yeah, he flew the coop. Nobody knows where he is. I heard it on the radio.
Flew the coop. Those FBI guys are gonna have me drivin' around all night.
I'm gonna be home late again.
[ Laughing ]
[ Air Hissing ]
I want you to take these and give 'em to Doc.
These I'm taking with me because
I haven't finished 'em yet.
They're for Dr.Ringold.
This I wrote for you, Nate.
It's-- It's about soils and, uh, some of my own thoughts.
- Your thoughts?
- [ Whispers ] Yeah.
- I could drive you.
- No, no, Nate. It's too chancy.
You gonna make it, man.
- Nate.
- George.
[ Whines ]
Pal.
Oh.
- [ Engine Revving ]
- [ Kids Chattering ]
- [ Glory ] I'll get it.
- [ George ] Okay, now you put the top on it.
[ Chatter Continues ]
- [ Al ] I can do it alone.
- [ Glory ] You, Al!
Mmm. Okay.
That tight enough?
Why don't you do it once more?
- Go ahead.
- Okay.
There you go.
Good. Now you fixed it.
What?
You came here to die, didn't you?
But I-- I like this place, and, um,
I love the people here.
You know, if-- if we were to, uh, to put this apple down... and leave it, it would be spoiled and gone within a few days.
But if we were to take a bite of it, like this, it would become part of us.
And we could take it with us forever.
Al.
Everything is on its way... to somewhere.
Everything.
That's a good bite.
Keep an eye out.
- Have you seen George Malley,
Ms.Pennamin?
- What's the point?
Look, it's not my call.
I haven't seen him.
You mind if I get in your truck?
Why?
[ Engine Starts,
Runs Smoothly ]
What's your first name?
Jack.
How would you want to die, Jack?
[ Engine Stops ]
Come on. Let's go.
[ Exhales ]
There you are.
I knew I'd find you here.
What are you working on?
Dr.Ringold's coming tomorrow, and I just wanted to finish this up.
- Finish what?
- Ah, just some possibilities.
Hey, come sit by me.
Hmm?
You scared?
No.
I wish I knew what you feel.
Oh, you do.
You've always known it, Lace.
I'll show you.
When your children were babies, how did you hold them?
[ Chuckles ]
And if they had a hard time sleeping and you had to rock them to sleep, well, how did you do it?
- [ Laughs ]
- See?
Hey. Look what I made back there.
Ah, that looks like a bed.
Are you expecting to get lucky?
No. Just hoping.
When the road gets dark
You can no longer see
Just let my love
Throw a spark, baby
And have a little faith in me
And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby
And have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
- Hey, I never kissed you there.
- Mm. No.
- Keeping track?
- Mm-hmm.
You going to sleep?
Huh-uh.
Are you?
No. And I don't want to sleep unless you're sleeping.
I don't want to--
- Lace.
- What?
- Sweetheart.
- What?
Now, you have to listen to me now.
What?
It's happening.
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
No. Wait, George. Wait.
- No.
- And it's gonna be okay.
- George.
- It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay.
- Good-bye, honey.
- No.
Oh.
Oh.
Hello. I'm John Ringold.
I'm here to see George Malley.
Oh! I'm sorry, John.
George Malley passed away last night.
Wh--
I-I'm sorry.
He left these for you.
He said they're not finished.
You'll have to do it.
I'll do my best.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
[ Crying ]
[ Wind Whistling ]
[ Sighs ]
Thank you, sweetie.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]
- [ Chuckles ]
- Nate, they'll be waiting for you.
- We're comin'. We're comin'.
If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love
I have inside
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.
But for now I find
- Whoo. Whoo.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]
- It's only in my dreams
- It's okay. It's okay.
- But I can't change the world
- [ Jimmy ] Hey, Nate!
- Hi, Ella!
- You look beautiful.
What am I gonna do with this?
- What am I gonna do?
- You would think my love was really something good
- [ Everyone Chattering ]
- Baby, if you knew that I
- Could change
- Not here.
- The world
- It's not here.
Tell you where it is.
- It's right there!
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that? It's magic.
- [ Bonnie ] Good job.
Can you hear her?
She just kicked.
- [ Tito ] Baby, huh?
- Yeah.
- Change the world
- Have a cold one.
- You gettin' any rest?
- [ Sighs ] Not much.
Well, get it now, because there's no sleepin' once the baby gets here.
- You would think my love was really something good
- Check.
Baby, if I could
- Change
- Go on now. Think it through.
Think it through.
The world
[ Everyone Chattering ]
Ah, ah
I was thinkin' out loud
One life's such a short time for love
When a match made in heaven arrives
Eternity is never enough
I need to dance
With life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance
With life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'Til we melt into the ground
Oh, we need to dance with life
And leave a brilliant light
Behind
It's no secret how I feel
This special moment
I love you
You seem to cover me up
And hide me deep
Deep in me
To dance with life
Breathe the sweet, fresh air
And make every second your last
And I'll touch you
A full moon shall wake you
Make the most of the present and the past
I need to dance
With life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance
With life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'Til we melt into the ground
Oh, we need to dance with life
And leave a brilliant light
Leave a brilliant light
Leave a brilliant light
Behind
Here's what I found out.
That all of life is a learning experience.
Everything is part of a big... master plan.
But sometimes it's--
Well, it's hard to read.
It's like if you get too close to the screen... all you can see is a bunch of little dots.
You don 't see the big picture until you stand back.
But when you do... everything comes into focus.
My name is Suzanne Maretto.
No, wait. I'm sorry.
Suzanne Maretto is my married name.
My own name... is Suzanne Stone.
That's my professional name.
It's not like I have any negative feelings about the name Maretto.
Maretto is the name, after all... of my husband... who I loved... very, very much.
Sorry.
It's also the name of his parents,
Joe and Angela Maretto... and of his lovely and talented sister, Janice Maretto... who have been like a second family to me... and who I regard as I do my own family... particularly since my recent tragedy.
I knew just through knowing and being related to them.
They have given me what I think is a very precious and valuable insight... into the different kinds of ethnic relationships... that are part of the very things that I've been trying to explore... as a member of the professional media.
First impressions in one word?
You really want to know?
Four letters, begins with C.'
Larry, it's a girl.
You ain't never seen one of them?
'Cold.'
Cold. C-O-I-D.
Yeah.
What did you think of Suzanne when you first met her?
I just didn't get the Suzanne thing.
All the girls around town thought Larry was really cute.
I mean, Larry used to hang out at the restaurant... on the nights when my dad... would let Larry and his dopey rock band play there.
Just, you know?
Oh, Susie Q
I love you
I love the way you walk
I love the way you talk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk
Laura Risley, I remember.
Peggy Holden.
She was kind of a slut.
He could've had anybody, basically, is what I'm saying.
I don't know. Suzanne-- blonde.
I don't know.
Well, yeah, sure,
I could've said some things.
Well, to tell you the truth,
I did say some things.
He's my brother.
But in a very subtle way.
What do you think of Angela Raguzzo?
She's all right.
- She's hot.
- Why?
She wants you to ask her out.
Look, don't try and fix me up with people. It's embarrassing.
All right.
What do you think of Dana Defalco?
You want me to go out with a girl whose father's in the mob?
- Who says he's in the mob?
- Everybody.
So? Don't you want a little excitement?
- I got all the excitement I can take.
- With who? The ice maiden?
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I don't?
- No.
Inform me.
Well, it's none of your business.
But Suzanne, she looks, you know... very fragile and delicate, right?
But when we're--
I mean, when I'm--
I don't know why I'm telling you this.
Details are too graphic.
But let me just tell ya, she's like--
She's like a volcano.
You mean people come from miles around just to watch her explode?
- Is that it?
- Very funny.
Like Mount Saint Helens?
Man! When he says to me--
I'm gonna marry her.
Wait a minute. You what?
'You what?' I said.
And then he says--
I'm tellin' ya, sis, she's it.
- She's the golden girl of my dreams.
- Oh, God.
And I did one of these... which I regretted right away...
'cause he looked at me with that kind of doggy look that guys get.
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding!
She can't even bowl.
Yes! Yes!
- Let me tell you something, all right?
- Yeah.
She's like--
She's like a delicate china doll.
You ever try kissing a doll?
You know, they don't kiss back.
She's like one of those porcelain figurines that Mom collects.
She is so pure and delicate... and innocent.
You just have to look at her, and you wanna take care of her... for the rest of your life.
Yeah, I can see that.
So--
Anyway, so when she, Suzanne, says to me--
If you're actively seeking a career in the professional ice skating field-- in the spotlight, so to speak--
I think you have to maximize your positive features.
Sure.
What I'm saying is that a qualified plastic surgeon... could just snip away those little beauty spots, or facial blemishes... and you'd see how much better you'd feel about yourself.
You know, commenting about my face and stuff.
I knew where she was going.
Miss Fixer-Upper.
I believe that Mr. Gorbachev--
The man who ran Russia for so long?
I believe that he would still be in power today if he'd done... what many people suggested and had that big purple thing taken off his forehead.
I firmly believe that.
Someday I hope to interview him, and we'll discuss that... along with other more pertinent international things.
I'm tellin' you, sis, she's gonna be the next Barbara Walters.
Is that right?
Well, Barbara does have many admirable qualities-- a wide knowledge of current events... and a deep sympathy for people's inner feelings... which is a trait so many people have who are of the Jewish persuasion.
Isn't she somethin' else?
So, yeah, that was it.
I mean, a done deal, finito.
He was a goner.
The point is that, for instance...
Connie Chung, who is married, I believe... to Maury Povich, the well-known interviewer... doesn't say, 'Hello, this is
Connie Povich with the news.'
I don't think she would be embarrassed by it... because she's already pretty ethnic when you think about it.
Or, to take another example... someone who doesn't appear to have an ethnic bone in her body--
Jane Pauley... who I strongly relate to... because, you know, we have similar physical traits.
Although, I thankfully don't have to struggle with the weight problem... like she does.
And she also, to the best of my knowledge... has never identified herself, audience-wise... as Jane Trudeau... even though her husband,
Mr. Trudeau... is a prominent cartoonist of some kind... and not, as so many people believe, the ex-president of Canada.
So, what I'm saying is this:
There are some people who never know who they are... or who they wanna be until it's too late... and that is a real tragedy in my book... because I always knew who I was and who I wanted to be, always.
Who wants to be on TV?
There she is!
- Look at who's looking at herself.
- Just look at that.
Suzanne, lookie there.
Come here.
Look at the camera.
- See?
- Look, what a darling.
Sweetheart.
Can't you get it focused better than that?
And we're back... with the families of Suzanne and Larry Maretto.
Mr. Stone.
At first, I have to admit we-- we didn't think too much of it, the relationship.
Here was our daughter, a college graduate.
Junior college, yes, but... with good grades and a degree in--
Electronic journalism.
Exactly.
And here was this young man... a good boy obviously... but, still, a boy whose education was... limited to high school.
I remember saying, 'Honey--'
Honey, I'm worried that you don't know what you're getting into with this kid.
- Dad, I'm not a little girl anymore.
- I know that.
All I'm saying is that... we come from pretty different backgrounds.
'For all you know his family could be mixed up with the mafia.'
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- No problem, Earl.
- I was just being--
- I understand.
I understand. Please.
She just laughed at me.
- Don't worry.
- I have to worry.
That's what dads do.
If you ask me, I'd say Larry appealed to a side of her... that you wouldn't ordinarily know was there.
It was a kind of a-- What?
A wild side.
Not wild, but--
Wild.
I thought he would marry--
I don't know.
A nice lfalian girl.
But like the guy in The Godfather says...
'This is America, okay?
The melting pot.'
Anyway, one day,
Larry comes over to me. He says--
I'm gonna tell you something, Pop.
She's going places.
She's got goals.
You know, she's studying stuff.
She's sending out resumes all the time.
Did I show you what she gave me for my birthday?
'You Can Be The 0ne.'
The one what?
Well, the one anything.
That's the point.
It's self-motivation.
It's from that guy on TV, the inspirational millionaire... with all the houses and yachts.
You know?
Sounds pretty serious.
Serious? Pop, I sold my drums.
- You sold your drums?
- Yep.
And he did.
He sold his drums...
And he did.
He sold his drums... and he turned himself right around... just for her.
The veil Suzanne wore... she had copied from a picture in a magazine... the exact same one
Maria Shriver wore at her wedding.
Larry, he was so proud, you know...
'cause Suzanne designed the wedding rings... all by herself.
You want me to describe them for you?
They were round, and gold.
I mean, big fuckin' deal.
Come on, Suze, let's go!
I'll still never find a guy like you, Dad.
What?
We got a postcard from Suzanne... every single day that they were on their honeymoon.
And it very much surprised us that they went to Florida... because Suzanne was never one to lie around the beach.
But Larry was very much into boatlng and fishing... and I think she just wanted to make him happY.
- That's a pretty lady you got there.
- Yes, sir.
We've been married for four days and 18 hours.
I wouldn't let her out of my sight for very long.
Well, she can't go in the sun.
It's not good to tan when you're on TV.
What show is she on?
Have I ever seen her?
Not yet, but you will.
Hi, honey.
Did you miss me?
Did you dream about me, baby?
It must've been a... pretty successful honeymoon, because when they came back they were--
- Radiant.
- Exactly. Radiant.
Larry took the money he was saving in case he wanted to go back to college... and put a down payment on that condo at the Heights.
And he bought her that pretty little Mustang.
- Hi. How are you?
- Come in!
All right. Come on.
So you thought Larry changed a lot after he and Suzanne were married?
Totally! It was like suddenly he went from Van Halen... to Jerry Vale overnight.
She didn't have any--
She thought she had taste, but--
Barquettes with leek chiffonade.
This is the dish that they serve... in Johnny Carson's favorite restaurant in Hollywood.
Well, hey, if it's good enough for Johnny--
Well, was that some meal or what?
I say Julia Childs better watch her back... or she'll be looking for another job.
Well, I won't be doing this every night.
I'm planning on starting this exercise class so I can get rid of a few pounds.
From where? Your feet?
- On TV the camera adds five pounds.
- Is that true?
I didn't know that.
Did you know that?
Talking about exercise,
I gotta go.
I got a rehearsal... at some god-awful hour all the way over in Norwalk.
- What are you rehearsing?
- Janice has a job in the lce Follies.
They're going on tour in September.
- That's fabulous.
- Thanks.
I'm just one of the chorus now, but--
Actually, I do skate this one medley.
It's kind of a, you know, salute to great TV shows.
I skate the Peggy Lipton part in the Mod Squad number.
Peggy Lipton?
Yeah.
I get to wear a blonde wig.
How exciting.
They're talking about like maybe a TV special this year or so--
Listen. Hang on, everybody.
Because, well, we've got... a pretty important announcement ourselves to make... and I think congratulations are in order.
Oh, honey.
Wait, wait, wait!
Cut, cut, cut!
It's not that.
- You're not--
- No, I'm not pregnant, for God's sake.
- Suzy's got a job.
- What?
Over at WWEN, the TV station.
The first woman they ever hired.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
Yep, our Suze is on her way now... and nothing is gonna stop her.
Oh, honey, I'm proud of you.
That's great.
We're proud of you.
That's great.
- How are the newlyweds?
- They're doing great.
- Thanks, Sal.
- Yeah, cute kids.
- Aren't they just?
- Yeah.
- Did you like the barquettes?
- The what?
With the leek chiffonade.
Was it okay?
We never did 'em before... but she showed us this recipe in a book, so--
No problem.
I never told anyone... even Joe.
So she couldn't cook.
There are worse crimes... as we all know.
You're not anybody in America unless you're on TV.
On TV is where we learn about who we really are... because what's the point of doing anything worthwhile... if nobody's watching?
And if people are watching, it makes you a better person.
Marry me.
Mary, say yes.
I thought she was like a goddess of some kind.
Like Lady Di before she dumped the prince... and went nudist and everything.
Suzanne bought me this dress, which I hope to fit someday.
Suzanne Maretto was a beautiful human being... with real dreams and aspirations.
Suzanne used to say
'Opportunity is always knocking... but if you aren't listening, its knuckles get sore... and it moves to another house.'
Something like that.
She said that even on her honeymoon she had Larry take her... to this hotel in Florida where there was going to be... this kind of convention of all these big-shot TV people... that she'd read about in a magazine.
Which, of course, she didn't tell Larry... because she didn't want to maybe hurt his feelings about... her attending to her career while they were bonding sexually... so to speak.
So the German reporter says to the Hungarian editor...
'Of course she's always smiling.
She gets 'faxed' at least ten times a day.'
Boom.
Thank you.
I know that's a silly joke... but it does illustrate our central thesis today... which is 'Here and Now in the...
Fast-Moving Computer Age.'
It's the--
In our fast-moving computer age... it's the medium of television... that joins together our global community.
And it is the--
It is the television journalist who serves as messenger... bringing the world into our homes... and our homes into the world.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
- The point is, Miss--
- Stone.
That's a good name.
Now, that's a name you can remember.
The point is, Suzanne... if you want it bad enough you'll get it... but you gotta really want it.
You gotta be able to do things that ordinary people wouldn't do.
You see what I'm saying?
I think so.
How about another of those?
- I don't know about that.
- Sweetheart?
Give us another all around.
Anyway, when I was at the network... there was this gal from some ten-watt station in the Midwest... where she did the weather.
The weather.
So she comes up to New York... in her best Donna Karan dress-for-success knockoff... blonde hair all done up in a French twist... and an audition tape in her imitation leather briefcase... along with a letter of introduction from her station manager.
And it says...
'Please give your most serious consideration... to the bearer of this letter--'
Miss So-and-so.
'Who is of moderate intelligence... who has some experience in broadcasting... and, more importantly... who can suck your cock until your eyes pop out.'
And you know who that gal is?
Who?
Is that true?
It's true.
And here comes the best part.
- Yes?
- This is the best part.
About ten years ago,
I'm at some TV conference somewhere... and I run into that station manager... and I congratulate him on his letter-writing skills.
And he doesn't know what I'm talking about.
Why doesn't he?
Because he didn't write the letter.
Oh. Who did?
She did.
She wrote it herself.
Oh, I see.
It's good, isn't it?
- I watch your show all the time.
- Everybody does.
So... what do you think, Suzanne?
What do I think about what?
Well--
Hi, honey.
Where were you?
I couldn't sleep.
When I put out the sign for a gal Friday...
I figured I'd be interviewing a couple of high school dropouts... who wouldn't mind going to the mall and picking up doughnuts... and emptying the ashtrays, that kind of thing.
This is when we first meet Gangbusters.
That's what George and I called Suzanne.
Not to her face, of course.
Mr. Grant, I am the woman you are looking for.
My name is
Suzanne Stone Maretto... but I plan to use Suzanne Stone as my professional name.
I'd like you to look over my resume... which details both my educational background... and my references in the media field.
I can make you a solemn promise that I will be... dedicated and committed to this job.
Hang on a second.
We're only looking for someone to answer the mail, run errands.
Minimum pay, no benefits.
Money is not my main concern.
I just want a chance to contribute something.
I think you'll find I have very valuable ideas about programming.
Whoa! No!
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
Take a look around you.
I mean, Suzanne, we're talking local cable station here.
I just want a chance to get my foot in the door.
Everybody has to start somewhere.
Do you know where
Edward R. Murrow started?
No, I don't.
No. Well, neither do I offhand.
I don't think it was at the top, do you?
I live only five minutes from here.
I will be willing and eager... to respond to any newsworthy emergency you put in front of me.
Mr. Grant, this is a dream
I have had all my life.
I will do anything to get this job.
This is my associate George.
Pleased to meet you, George.
Well, we'll think about it.
I believe that my assets--
I said we'll think about it!
And we will.
Thank you.
I believe that in our fast-moving computer age... it is the medium of television that joins together the global community... and it is the television journalist who serves as messenger... bringing the world into our homes and our homes into the world.
It has always been my dream to become such a messenger.
I look to you, gentlemen, now... to make that dream... a reality.
Jesus Christ.
Gangbusters.
Fuckin' gangbusters.
- Come on back to bed.
- I gotta go to work.
- Ten minutes.
- I gotta go.
- Five minutes.
- I gotta put my face on.
- Put your face on me. Two minutes.
- Take your hand away.
Come, Walter.
The dog was a cute little thing, wasn't it?
She was crazy about that dog.
It was darling.
Oh, hello!
She named it Walter... after Walter--
Is it 'Cronkite'?
The guy who used to be on TV.
I think he was Dan Rather's uncle or something.
It was like a hair ball puked up by some demon from hell.
There wasn't much to do.
Most of the time she just sat over there and worked on her file... her idea file.
She had so many ideas.
This is the presentation on that idea with me going to local movie theaters... talking to the people coming out to see what they really think.
An actual... vox populae, if you know the term.
Here's the memo on that children's show with me as the hostess... and the live, in-studio animals.
Look it over tonight.
Give me your thoughts in the morning.
A couple of pages outlining that concept for interviewing everyday citizens... like mailmen, school crossing guards... to inform our citizenry on what kind of valuable services are available to them.
After a few months, she wore me down.
I let her do the evening weather report, which she was fine at.
Although with the preparation she put into it... you'd think she was covering D-Day.
Six, five...
Six, five... four, three... two, one.
You're on!
Good evening from the WWEN Weather Center.
Weather Center?
The heavy system we were expecting... moving down from the north is not going to show up after all... because the high pressure system... is going to be moving up to the north.
The temperature for tonight will remain unseasonably cool... with patches of fog in the morning and probably--
Come on.
Let's have some quiet here.
The winds are at seven to ten miles per hour.
Sunrise will be at 6:12.
That's about It for your up-to-the-minute weather report.
This is your
WWEN weather person saying...
I'll be with You again tomorrow evening, rain or shine.
I never really gave a rat's ass about the weather... until I got to know Mrs. Maretto.
Now I take it very seriously.
If it rains... or there's lightning or thunder... or if it snows...
I have to jack off.
Oh, right. Sorry.
Today's guest, Mrs. Maretto... is a representative of our local television station, WWEN.
- On-air correspondent.
- I'm sorry?
Actually, I'm an on-air correspondent.
Well, that's fine.
Anyway, Mrs. Maretto has asked to have a few words with you.
I know that while I'm gone you will give her your best attention.
Here's my best attention.
Did you say something, Russell?
No, Mr. Finlaysson, I didn't.
I didn't!
Well, first of all,
I would like to thank you all... for extending me the courtesy of your time and attention.
I got something to extend.
And I would like to say that I hope you'll all be as excited... about the project I'm here to propose to you as I am.
First of all, I want to ask... have any of you ever been on television before?
Not counting home video, of course.
No one?
I was!
- What's your name?
- Lydia Mertz.
And how did it happen that you made this appearance?
It was down at Benson's Electronics.
They have this video camera in the window... and when you walk by they take your picture.
Well, this may come as a surprise... but that is how some of our most famous personalities started out-- just seeing what they look like, accidentally.
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.
Now, I am producing a television documentary... about kids just like yourselves... because it is teenagers like you... who are the future of our nation.
And, after all, I used to be a teenager myself once... back in the Dark Ages.
I would like to find out about your way of life-- how you feel about your education... how you feel about things like peer pressure... how you feel about drugs... rap music.
Pussy?
Do we have to get permission slips from our parents for this?
No, that wouldn't be necessary.
When'd your folks learn to read and write?
Hey, read this, shitface.
All right.
I am going to put this list on your bulletin board.
And any of you who think this project... would be as meaningful as I know it can be... put their names on it.
I would also like to thank you all... for your interest.
- Everything settled then?
- Yes.
Well, then let's give
Mrs. Maretto our thanks... and a round of applause.
Thank you.
Sign up.
I'd never really signed up for anything before... except an after-school weight watchers program... which I was asked to leave anyway
'cause they said I wasn't motivated... and because I gained 11 pounds in three weeks.
But this was different...
'cause it turned out to be the most important thing I ever did.
Now, here's some advice,
Russell dear.
That nice Mrs. Maretto is married to a boy... whose father is a pillar of the ltalian-American community... and if he knew how you had insulted... his only beloved daughter-in-law... he would make one phone call... and a man with a big knife would show up in the middle of the night... and turn you into a eunuch.
You know what a eunuch is?
Of course you don't.
You can find it in the dictionary.
If you don't know how to spell it, you can look it up under 'nutless wonders.'
So I'm thinking, there must be some simple way... for you to make it up to Mrs. Maretto... for your offensive behavior.
What do you think?
What is a eunuch?
I have to say that the staff at WWEN...
I have to say that the staff at WWEN... responded with total enthusiasm to my project... and gave me excellent support... both editorially and technically... because I think they could sense almost immediately... that I was onto something important... in a sociological sense.
She must've taped
God-knows-how-many hundreds of hours... with these three dorky kids... who, from what I've seen, would have a major struggle on their hands... just reciting the days of the week in proper order.
Forget about social insights.
Here, I'll show you.
This is 'Teens Speak Out' project, tape one, take one.
I'm Suzanne Stone and these are--
Now, let's just saY something in general about ourselves.
Like what?
What do you plan to do with your future?
I don't exactly have a plan.
Well, you must have aspirations of some kind.
What?
A dream, a life goal.
I can tell you
Lydia's big life goal.
It's to fuck the new kids on the block.
That's a dirty lie!
I don't want to hear language like that.
It is very offensive... and it is unsuitable for broadcast under FCC regulations.
- You got that?
- Yeah.
Anyways, it was Motley Crue.
All right, Lydia.
- Just for your information.
- What about you, James?
I think you get the point.
It's not exactly
Mike Wallace, eat your heart out.'
But I have to say
I've never seen more persistence.
I once said to her--
What about we call it a night?
Just need to get this reel cleaned up.
An hour, maybe two.
You go ahead. I'll lock up.
Don't you have that nice husband waiting at home for you?
He knows how much this means to me.
He works full-time at his dad's restaurant, so he gets home real late.
Well, Suzanne, I sure pity the person who says no to you.
No one ever does.
Why're you tyin' her up again?
Why is she fied up again?
Just leave her alone.
Untie yourself.
Leave her alone.
If she runs away--
As Scripture says,
God is alive.
Fucker.
That life, friends, is heaven.
Heaven is waiting for you.
See, nobody ever called me that before.
All anyone ever called me was...
Jimmy or Jimbo or... other stuff.
My mom told me that I was named Jimmy... after this old movie star she liked... named Jimmy Dean.
But... well, when anyone ever asked me,
I always said I was named Jim... after Jim Morrison of The Doors...
'cause, you know... he had this great kind of life... just traveling around and writing his songs... and having women beg him to do it to them... even to take his...
'organ' out onstage.
That kind of life
I thought I'd like to have.
I bet he jumps her all the time, you know?
Like after dinner, just bang, right on the kitchen table.
Fuckin' during even.
Yeah. Maybe both.
Those skinny bitches, they can't get enough of it.
They're always wanting it.
That's a medical fact.
It's because the nerves in their body are all bunched up in their snatch.
They're all right up in there... so they're all whack.
I don't think that's true.
What are you, a doctor?
She's a perfectly nice person.
You think she's gonna make you a big movie star?
Just to be on TV will be something nice.
It'd be something different.
I got something different for you right here.
You're a disgusting pig.
Yeah.
You know what we should do?
We should get some money out of it.
- What makes you think she's got any?
- You shittin' me?
Her husband, Mr. Fuckin' Big Cock... owns a fuckin' guinea restaurant, all right?
Look at the car she drives.
Look at her fuckin' fingernails.
Big, red, sculpted, glossy nails.
She got plenty of money.
That's rich bitch stuff.
Yeah, maybe.
You think she's some kind of hot shit.
- She just looks--
- What?
Clean.
Come on. They're ready.
Kids, stop it.
- That's a real pretty outfit, honey.
- Thanks.
- You want one of these?
- No, thanks.
What about one of these?
You're goin' in the pool.
No, thanks.
He sure is great with those kids.
He's gotta stop eating that junk.
He's getting a rubber tire around him.
He'll make a wonderful father someday.
He calls them love handles.
I call them flab.
- What about you?
- Me? You think I look fat?
No! What about the idea of kids?
That's what I mean.
Well, I love kids.
I absolutely love them, but... a woman in my field with a baby has two strikes against her.
- Say I'm in New York--
- New York?
Well, for instance.
And I'm suddenly called on some foreign assignment... like a royal wedding or a revolution in South America.
You can't run from place to place with your crew following... and conduct serious interviews with a big, fat stomach.
Or say you've already had the baby, and you've got this blubber... these boobs out to here.
It's just so gross.
Careful!
- Excuse me.
- Nice.
You having a good time?
Well, I want to get out of the sun.
I have to go prepare my show.
I sure would like to have a couple of them. What do you think?
What do you think?
I think if you wanted a baby-sitter you should've married Mary Poppins.
Hi, Ed. Wake up, George.
Let's hit it.
Hi, everybody.
This is Suzanne Stone with your late-nlght sign-off weather report... from the WWEN Weather Center.
I don't think I need to tell you that today was a hot one.
That old mercury zoomed on up to 91.
That's a record-breaking temperature for this day.
Tomorrow promises to be more of the same... with relevant numbers up in the 90's... humidity to match... and maybe just a hint of a breeze or two.
Won't be much help with this heat, the kind of heat... that makes me want to head for that swimming hole with my friend James... strip off everything, including my panties... which you can see right fhrough anyway... and poke my soft, pink tongue in his mouth... and slide my hand way up the inside of his leg... until he's so hot that he rolls over on top of me... and I'm yelling, 'James,' his name.
What are you doing to me... with your big, fat, hard--
Oh, Jesus.
Listen to me, Larry.
So she finishes her little docudrama... whatever the fuck it is.
She sends it off to someone in New York, and while she's waiting for an answer... you should, forgive the expression, knock her up.
Knock her up and then-- Whoa!
Los Angeles? What does Los Angeles got to do with it?
A course in what?
Advanced media?
Advanced bullshit!
Look, I'm sorry.
You're my brother.
I know you love her and want her to succeed... but sometimes, man, you just gotta say no.
What do you mean, how?
N-O, that's how.
Comes to the right of the key, throws up a hook shot.
It's good!
The score is again tied here in the first half at the Palace.
With the ball--
Yeah?
What are you doin'?
Just sitting here, waiting for you.
I asked you to please keep your feet off the coffee table.
- We got to talk about some things.
- What kind of things?
I think you know.
No, I don't.
Can't this wait until tomorrow?
I'm really tired.
What?
No, I don't think it can wait.
Sit down.
We're gonna talk about this stuff.
I think we got this great future ahead of us.
I just want to make sure we both understand what the priorities are.
I think Pop's gonna let me take over managing the restaurant.
And I got a lot of exciting ideas... like introducing some new menu items... bringing in live music on the weekends... and maybe even one night a week... open house for local singers and comics... which you, with your TV background, could help me with.
You know, maybe shooting the acts... and then maybe selling the tapes... which you could edit yourself back to the performers.
I talked to my folks about it, and they thought it'd be a great idea.
Really.
And, believe me, I am not selling short what you're doing now.
I mean, the weather report stuff... which you're really good at.
But let's face facts.
It's probably not gonna... lead to any big network offers.
Now, this way... we could be working together in both our respective fields... doing what a family is supposed to be doing.
A family, that's what
I'm talking about.
What do you think?
I'll think about it.
It's true that the road my husband and I chose to travel on... was paved with many speed bumps.
Larry said he would never stand in my way, whatever happened.
But the word failure' is not part of my vocabulary.
My commitment to my career or my marriage, or whatever... has always been 110 percent.
Regardless of how fast I was growing in my vocation...
I would never leave Larry behind.
The word divorce' was never mentioned.
What do you think?
Like the color?
- Yeah.
- It doesn't make me look fat?
I think I'm gonna get it.
Mr. Maretto is going to--
Yeah, right.
Let me tell you something.
- No, you wouldn't understand.
- Maybe I would.
Well, you grow up, you know.
You think it's all gonna be like a fairy tale.
Like you're Sleeping Beauty and along comes this Prince Charming.
And he looks at you and it's nighttime.
And he smiles at you and kisses you.
Yeah, I know that story.
And then... you wake up... and it's daylight... and you look at him.
When you work all day, trying to perfect yourself... and create something meaningful, you expect support.
Does anyone ever say,
'Did you have a good shoot today?'
Or 'How's the editing going?'
I guess not.
I mean, the point is...
Larry is a nice guy, you know... but he just doesn't know a thing about television.
Let's get outta here.
Mrs. Maretto bought me lots of nice stuff...
Mrs. Maretto bought me lots of nice stuff... like this ankle bracelet, for instance... and a bottle of real expensive perfume-- a 'scent' she called it-- which I'm saving for a special occasion.
No one ever really bought me stuff before... except my mom's boyfriend Chester... who got me for my birthday when I was 12... a bottle of something called
Garden of Eden body oil... which he said would be good for my skin... and which he wanted to show me how to use... which I let him do.
He did other things for a while.
When I was 13, I got this mild case of
T. B. and he wasn't interested anymore.
You just have to block that out of your memory... like some scary TV movie where you just change the channel... and pretend like it never happened.
Before you know it, the whole thing will be like a bad dream.
Anyway, my mom keeps this gun hidden in her closet...
'cause of all the sex fiend killers around.
And one time, I told him if he didn't leave me alone...
I'd get it out and I'd shoot him.
I mean, he didn't give me any more trouble or anything.
Now I guess I wish
I hadn't told her all that...
'cause maybe it put some ideas in her mind.
I don't know.
I just told her stuff I'd never told anyone, because she was my friend.
She was my only real friend.
Where are you going?
I told you, hon.
Pop and I are going to the trade show in Freeport.
- We're leaving from the restaurant.
- Yeah. Right.
- Look, are you going to be okay?
- Sure.
Will you think about what we talked about?
I have been.
That's great, hon, because I believe...
I got something here that's really gonna work.
You know who I want with me by my side?
- Who?
- 'Who'? My best girl, that's who!
My beautiful little lady.
I left a phone number on the fridge.
And don't forget to lock the garage.
Bye.
You know what
I'm thinkin', Larry?
Why don't we get some artificial plants for the restaurant?
Good idea.
- Then we don't have to water them.
- Exactly.
Come on, Liddy.
I can't do this,
Mrs. Maretto.
Of course you can.
You just have to let your natural sense of rhythm take over.
I don't think I have one of those.
- She really stinks at this.
- Here.
Watch me.
Watch me.
Watch my hips.
You can do that.
Can't you?
- I can't do that.
- Of course you can!
You just have to move.
Move your body.
Come on.
Come on. Relax.
Relax!
You're like a stick.
- I can't do this.
- Move your hips.
No, I gotta sit down.
This is makin' me feel all funny.
Come on, James.
Come on.
Come on, James.
I'm dancing.
- Would you do me an enormous favor?
- Sure. What?
Walter hasn't been out for hours.
Would you take him for a walk around the block?
- Yeah. Sure.
- I'm gonna go upstairs.
Take my sweater off.
It's really hot in here.
When you come back,
I'll fix us something to eat.
And, Liddy?
Don't let him come back until he's done his business, okay?
Like a good little boy.
I'm back.
Hello?
I have to use the bathroom.
It was like I was in one of those--
Okay, you know those great movies where everyone is comin' out of their graves?
With like half their faces missing... and their eyes hanging out and their lips falling off?
You know those?
And they're all walking around... real slow like this.
They're all walking like this and kind of grunting.
And they're all looking for the same thing.
For regular live people, to eat their flesh... and drink their blood and all.
Smile. Smile.
And they can 't help themselves...
'cause they're dead... and that's just what happens.
That's what I felt like.
You gotta tell me what's wrong, please.
James, do you think about me when we're not together?
All I do is think about you.
When I'm not with you,
I'm not alive.
Mrs. Maretto... you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
- I can't do this anymore.
- What?
I can't go home every night and have him try to touch me.
And all the time
I'm just thinking about you.
About us.
And when I push him away, he has this temper.
What do you mean?
Does he hurt you?
There were these women, you know... on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show the other day... and they were all wearing disguises so their husbands couldn't find them.
They were living in shelters, and
I thought I could live in one of them.
If they let me bring Walter with me,
I could live in one of them.
Someplace in another state where no one even knows who I am.
Look. Couldn't you just get a divorce?
- And then--
- But then he would get the condo.
And he'd get the car.
And he'd take Walter from me!
He'd take Walter.
I know you think
I'm just a kid, but...
I could never do anything bad to you... or ever hurt you.
A guy that does that to someone like you... doesn't deserve to live.
That's the truth.
He doesn't deserve to live.
No. I suppose you're right.
He doesn't.
Oh, fuck!
I love this song!
Don't you love this song?
I don't know.
Mrs. Maretto used to let me drive around in her car... even though I didn't have a learner's permit.
'Cause she said when she'd be living in California and doing her TV shows... she'd make me her personal assistant, and I'd have to drive her places... and help her answer her personal fan mail.
I guess this is the most exciting time of my life.
It was like living in a really great movie... except it was kind of X-rated on account of all the sex stuff, you know.
Hey. Don't stop.
You didn't answer my question.
What question was that?
Did you talk to Russell?
Yeah, I did.
What did he say?
He wants a thousand dollars.
- Is that all?
- And some CDs.
- Did you get the gun?
- No, not yet.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
I guess I thought you'd ask Lydia or--
I can't ask Liddy. You have to.
Don't you understand?
I guess so, but I thought--
Do you want me to keep doing what I was doing?
- Yeah, please.
- Okay.
Then you have to do what you have to do.
- So when will it happen?
- Please don't--
- I just want to know when.
- Let's just do this.
I don't know.
Whenever. Jesus.
If you don't know,
I'll have to find somebody who does.
Aw, Mrs. Maretto, you have to understand.
No. I think I do understand.
Obviously you're not the mature individual that I thought you were.
Actually,
I just had a thought.
- Maybe a better way to go on the thing.
- What's that?
- Russell.
- What about him?
Russell's enough of a man to take charge of the situation.
- Well--
- He looks at me in a certain way.
I think he'd be very appreciative of what I could do for him.
What do you think?
I think we could probably do it next week.
Is that soon enough?
Would you really do that for me, James?
Anything.
And then we can be together.
And you can sleep over.
And we could do anything we wanna do.
- Anything?
- Yeah.
Anything.
Got it?
Got it?
Stand back, tell me if it's straight.
Oh, it looks great.
Hey, Walter!
Five.
Four.
Come on, boy.
Let's go for a walk.
Three.
Two.
One.
Hi, everybody.
- This is Suzanne Stone, live.
- What do you want?
Don't fuckin' move.
Just take whatever you want and get out.
Come on, Jimmy. Now!
Wait.
Just wait.
Take the watch.
It's a Rolex.
I know it's a fucking Rolex.
Think it's the first time I've seen one?
Gimme your fuckin' chain.
Gimme your chain.
As you've probably noticed, it's been another beautiful evening... with just a slight chill in the air... and those autumn temperatures right about where they should be.
Now, Jim.
Do it.
- No, please.
- Give me your ring.
- My ring?
- Give it to me.
I can't give you my ring.
My wife will kill me.
She'd kill you?
Suzanne would kill you?
You know my wife?
Jimmy, now.
Fuckin' now, asshole!
Do it!
God, forgive me.
So, for the next few days it should be... just about perfect for boat season weather.
That's about it for tonight.
I'm Suzanne Stone saying--
And if you'll allow me, just a personal note.
A special greeting to my husband Larry... on this, our first anniversary.
Good night, honey.
Come on!
Hello.
Hello.
Anything?
Looks like a little dirt.
Who knows?
- And this.
- What?
Don't know.
Feels like pieces of shell.
- Janice Maretto?
- Yeah, that's me.
Telephone call at the desk.
Hello.
What?
Thank you.
Hey, wake up!
We're open right now!
All Saturday night around the clock.
Anything upset him at the restaurant?
Some guy come in and drink too much, or say something to him?
Five-piece, all-wood dinettes in Colonial, oak and white.
Your choice, 297.
Complete king bed set-- mattress, box, frame-- 297.
- That's Tom Peterson.
- And Gloria Stewart.
And that concludes our broadcast day at WWEN.
Your communitY access station serving Little Hope... and the greater
Hope County area.
You don't have to talk to those people if you don't want to.
That's what surprised me.
That he didn't put up much of a fight.
I mean, for a guy with such a mean temper.
When I was standing in the hall... with the gun...
I was trying to keep from being too nervous... by thinking about
Mrs. Maretto... and how we'd be together for the rest of our lives.
Let us take leave of our brother.
Living in Callfornia,
Florida, somewhere...
Iying around on beaches where everyone goes topless... and working on her TV show.
When the love of Christ, which conquers all things... destroys even death itself.
All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself
Anymore
I just knew.
I don't know why I knew.
I just-- I just knew.
It was like a light just went off in my head, and I knew she'd--
I knew she just got rid of him.
Just got in her way.
Anyway--
Then I didn't see her again.
That was the last time I saw her.
Suzanne.
I'm sorry.
Could we--
Could we stop for a second?
- What do you want, Liddy?
- Just to talk.
I'm really busy right now.
What do you want to talk about?
- What we're gonna do!
- We?
You and me and Jimmy.
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared about.
You and I and Jimmy are gonna stay miles away from each other.
Well, he's here.
Here?
Shit! Where?
Across the street.
Jesus Christ!
Get in here.
Get in here quick!
Now you listen to me.
You tell James to stay away, all right?
What is the matter with you people?
Don't you ever watch Mystery Theater?
He says that he needs to see you and that he's dying of love.
Tell him to call a doctor.
And Russell wants his money and his CDs.
Really? You tell Russell if he doesn't keep his mouth shut... he's gonna be playing his goddamn CDs in the gas chamber!
What else?
What do you want?
Just to be like before, like we were.
Lydia, we can't be like we were.
We have to forget we ever knew each other.
Go on, get outta here.
What about the Tv show in California and everything?
Jesus, Liddy.
Get real.
God!
- Did you tell her I love her?
- Yes, I did.
She said you were sick and you needed to see a doctor.
Hello, Suzanne.
How's it goin'?
I'm real unhappy I haven't been able to give you an exclusive on everything.
- Pardon?
- The competing news markets... are clamoring for attention, and
I have to consider future possibilities.
- Of course. I understand absolutely.
- Good.
I need to collect my tapes.
With all the publicity,
I've decided to finish my documentary--
- There's gonna be a slight problem.
- Problem?
- The cops took 'em.
- What do you mean?
- They came and took 'em away.
- Why would they do that?
- They said it was standard procedure.
- But those tapes belong to me!
Technically speaking, those tapes actually belong to us.
I mean, to the station, until such time--
I'll show you the section that peaked the cops' interest, you might say.
Today we're talking about sexually transmitted diseases... and teenage attitudes toward them.
Would anyone like to start it off?
Personally, I'm against them.
Let's see if we can be more specific.
What do you think of when I say the word 'AIDS'?
- Queers.
- Perversion.
The Hershey Highway.
Settle down, children.
What about you, Liddy? Supposing you were in a sexual relationship?
Would you expect that person to wear a condom?
I don't know.
I guess it would depend on, you know, what kind of person he was.
Yeah, a blind person.
How about you, James?
Are you personally concerned about AlDS?
Well, in my present situation--
Well, in the relationship I got goin',
I don't worry about that type of thing.
She's not that kind of person.
She's very clean.
That's the piece GerAldo used with some minor editing.
It was on First Edition and American Justice.
We made a few bucks on this one, and got a nice credit.
...in the Holy Spirit,
I want you to bow down...
Arms straight up.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you for my life.
Think a llttle bit about Your llfe.
Think about what you can part with.
A dollar? Ten dollars?
A hundred dollars?
How important is Jesus in your life?
As you can imagine...
I was shocked beyond comprehension.
I mean, to think that these disadvantaged youngsters... who I had taken under my wing and spent my time with... and who would only stand to ultimately benefit from my media savvy... to think they might be responsible for this heinous crime!
It simply boggles one with disbelief.
Of course, I realized, and I hope this doesn't sound callous... that the upside to all this, assuming justice prevailed... is that I would have in my documentary an extremely marketable commodity.
Something that even PBS would take an interest in... which would mean a smaller audience but a much larger prestige factor.
- Want to tell us about it?
- I got nothin' to tell.
- Your friend Russell told us plenty.
- Like what?
He said your dick was bigger than your brain.
Oh, yeah?
He really said that?
I don't think he meant it as a compliment.
- Fuckin' amateurs.
- Who?
Listen, as career criminals... you guys flunk out of kindergarten.
Your prints are on the gun.
Your pal left a trail of clam shells all over the murder scene.
You boys did everything but leave a business card.
There's Larry Maretto's blood all over those shoes you wore.
And pieces of Larry's brains.
He, he, he used to beat her up all the time.
- He said he was gonna kill her.
- I'm sure he did.
We were going to California 'cause... she said I had real potential in TV 'cause of my voice.
- Doing what with your voice?
- Sports.
Like being a sports announcer.
When did you start bangin' her?
- It wasn't like that.
- What was it like?
It was just--
We were--
You were what?
In love.
We were in love.
How many times? How many times did you do it, you and Mrs. Maretto?
I don't know.
- Lots, I guess.
- Where?
In her bed? ln her and her dead husband's bed?
Yeah, sometimes.
Where else?
In her car.
- In her car.
- Yeah.
And once at school.
Jesus Christ.
At school, huh?
Yeah. In the back of the gym.
And once late at night at the station where she does her weather reports.
And twice at the motel on Piedmont.
0h, and the back of Russell's truck.
And the movie theater on Hayworth.
Oh, a couple times at her parents' house... when they were away on some vacation or something.
And... also in the field behind the gas station.
Probably where you get your doughnuts and coffee.
It's close.
Hi, Liddy.
Is it my imagination, or is that diet working?
You lost a few pounds in there?
I don't know. I haven't been eating much lately.
What's this about talking to the police?
I just figured that Russell would tell them everything, so--
Look. No one's gonna believe anything Russell or Jimmy say.
TheY're just a couple of punks.
They wouldn't be in this deep shit if theY'd kept their mouths shut.
There's no evidence that we're involved.
I wasn't near the house.
And if they did find out anything, you know who'd be in trouble, don't you?
- You would!
- What do you mean?
If you hadn't gotten your mother's gun,
Larry would still be alive.
- But you asked me to.
- No, I didn't.
No. Jimmy did.
Don't you remember that?
But you asked Jimmy, and you told Russell that you'd pay.
I don't think so.
Now you listen to me.
I never gave Russell any money.
Do you understand?
The way I remember, it was your plan all along. You and Jimmy!
You had a fixation about me, and you were getting a perverted kick out it... like people with your sexual problems tend to do.
Russell went along with you because
Russell is an evil fucking scumbag!
Who, I'll bet, you were having some kind of dirty sex with... in spite of your lesbian tendencies.
- Wait a minute!
- Wait for what?
I thought we were friends.
Okay, then.
Can you take some advice from a friend?
You keep your fuckin' mouth shut.
It's their word against mine.
Who are they?
A bunch of 16-year-old losers who grew up in trailers... whose parents sit around drinking and screwing their cousins.
I'm a professional person, for Christ's sake.
I come from a good home.
Who do you think a jury would believe?
Thank God we still have legal procedures in this country.
The court has ruled this is a clear case of police entrapment.
The tapes were found to be inadmissible evidence.
My client was granted bail in the amount of $200,000, which we felt was steep... but at least she'll be able to assist us in the preparation of her defense.
Do you have a statement?
You have something you'd like to say?
- Suzanne, please say something.
- I just want to say... it's nice to live in a country... where life, liberty... and all the rest of it still stand for something.
- Thank you.
- What are you gonna do now?
I'm gonna go home and walk my dog.
- How will you address the questions?
- Will you take the stand?
Did you get those kids to kill your husband?
I loved Larry Maretto... with all my heart.
But the fact is... my husband had a serious cocaine problem.
There.
I've said it.
I've finally said it.
I believe that while
I was making my documentary...
'Teens Speak Out'...
James and Russell became acquainted with my husband without me knowing... and got him addicted to drugs... and became his main supplier.
And when he tried to break free of them or maybe when he told them... he was thinking of turning them in to the law... they killed him.
I had no intention of revealing thls dark side... of my late husband's character... because I wanted to spare his parents the pain.
But I just don 't have a choice any more.
I have to defend myself with the truth.
There were times when--
And I know someday when my fight is over...
I will be joining my husband... in the heaven that he so fervently believed in.
And that was the last time we--
- The last time we saw her.
- And that--
That pretty well brings us up to date.
Until your phone call, which I must say wasn't entirely unexpected... since in the last few days a number of interesting offers for my story... have been literally pouring in from the networks... and some major movie studios.
I totally understand why we'll be keeping this meeting confidential... until such time as we may come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
And I have to admit... that I really do enjoy... this spy story aspect of our first rendezvous, if I may call it that.
Because I think that being a good investigative reporter... is very much like being a kind of secret agent.
I hope you enjoy viewing this document... which I believe could serve as the first draft... that you Hollywood people are so richly rewarded for.
Well, I guess that's a wrap.
Come on, Walter.
- Suzanne?
- Yes.
Finally.
The famous Suzanne Maretto.
How nice to meet you.
Did you come all the way from Hollywood?
I came a long distance to see you.
Who's this?
This is Walter.
Walter.
Hi, Walter.
I don't know why, but I thought that you'd be older... running a big studio and everything.
I am older.
Come on out.
I want to show you something.
I brought my tape.
Let's go.
Let's go for a walk.
Oh, dear.
Where are we going?
To show you.
What?
It has to do with your story.
It is so funny.
I don't see why we have to go.
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much.
It sure looks good.
Thanks, Mrs. Maretto.
Maretto's.
I understand.
Thank you.
I'll be here... every day for life.
Plus thirty years, if I live that long.
Plus thirty years, if I live that long.
Russell copped a plea and got only 16 years.
I miss him.
He was my friend.
And Lydia too.
She was okay.
Mostly Mrs. Maretto.
And the weird thing is... now it's hard for me to even remember what she looked like.
You know?
Except when I dream about her... which I do every night.
I dream I'm at a baseball game... and I'm way up in the broadcasting booth.
And I'm callin' all the plays.
And she's sittin' right next to me... with her hand on my leg, feelin' me up.
I can hardly wait to get to sleep at night.
Suzanne used to say that you're not really anybody in America... unless you're on Tv.
'Cause what's the point of doing anything worth while... if there's nobody watching?
So when people are watching, it makes you a better person.
So if everybody was on TV all the time... everybody would be better people.
But if everybody was on TV all the time... there wouldn't be anybody left to watch.
That's where I get confused.
Anyhow, they're flying me to go on Oprah next weekend.
I hope she's gonna give me some diet tips.
And Phil Donahue called too.
But to tell you the truth,
I'm kinda nervous about that one...
'cause I honestly can't follow what he's sayin' most of the time.
There's some others too that I can't remember off hand.
But it's really something when you think that...
I'm the one who's gonna be famous.
Suzanne would die if she knew.
End sticks.
Oh, see you in the choir on Sunday!
Hi, Mike.
Hello?
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Been home long?
No. I just got back from the store.
We're looking forward
to tonight.
Can I bring anything?
I think I have everything.
Well, if there's
anything...
Wait.
There is something.
Do you have any champagne glasses?
I thought we'd start with champagne.
We have some.
Do you have eight?
No. We have six.
Bring them. Mitch and I will drink from jelly glasses.
You're going
to such trouble.
I always go to lots of trouble for a dinner party.
I've got to run.
See you around 8:00. Bye.
Bye.
Look at this floor.
I thought you love chocolate chip cookies.
Where's that book
I gave you?
When I was a little girl, this was my favorite book.
Which one was your favorite story?
What difference does it make?
Let me out of here! Help!
It's been so long,
I almost can't remember them.
Help! Let me out!
What are you doing?
Just preheating to 350.
Help! Help! There's a crazy woman here!
She's going to cook me!
She's going to eat me! Help!
I never could do long division.
Let's see.
How many times does 12 go into 75?
Oh... 6 times,
3 left over.
Why?
Well, at 12 minutes a pound, that means you have to be in the oven by no later than...
Oh... but evisceration takes at least an hour.
Evisceration?
What's that?
It's like gutting a fish.
First you make a long slit, then remove everything that isn't meat... the heart, the lungs, the intestines, and so forth.
Then you fill it back up with stuffing, sew it back together with one of these.
Maybe I should get started now.
Wait. There's plenty of time.
This was your favorite book.
Don't you want to hear a story?
A love story?
Yeah!
Well, not really.
But it's a really good one.
You'll like it a lot.
Here.
It's about these guys in college.
They live in the same dorm.
And one of them's kind of poor, so he works his way through school selling things.
Hey!
Be careful with that.
His name's Bellingham,
and he collects antiques.
Well, one day,
Bellingham got
a very special delivery.
Meanwhile, the other guys...
Andy and Lee...
they were real rich.
And they did something
very nasty to Bellingham.
Lee, the most work you've done in four years of college is filling out that application for the Penrose Fellowship.
Hey... hard work pays off,
Andy, especially when you have a girlfriend who can write award-winning essays about why I want to spend the summer traveling Europe.
I suppose my sister's pretty smart.
She's just not very honest.
I don't see why you'd risk it.
If they learn she wrote the proposal for you, they'll kick you out.
Your family sends you to Europe every summer anyway, so I don't understand.
Ah.
But this way I have the fellowship money to bring back a Maserati.
Maserati.
Guess who was my main competitor for the Penrose.
You know Bellingham works part-time at the university museum.
Where Susan does volunteer work. I know.
You better hope he doesn't find out she helped you screw him out of that fellowship.
Bellingham has the hots for Susan.
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.
Ah, Andy.
Ah, Edward.
How you doing?
You going to introduce me to your friend?
Uh, yeah.
This is...
Lee... Monckton, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. I, uh, saw your picture in our illustrious college newspaper.
Congratulations.
Oh... thank you.
It's an odd coincidence, us meeting, since we're in competition for the Penrose
Fellowship.
Oh, wait, wait.
You said it.
Competition.
Somebody... has to win, you know.
Not always the better man.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Allow me.
Hey, thanks.
That lot 249 was a heavy mother.
You'll get your money back tomorrow.
Oh, there's no rush.
Uh...
I'll tell you what,
Edward.
Just show us what you have in there, and my friend here will write it off.
All right.
If lot 249 lives up to my expectations, it won't matter that I was cheated out of the Penrose.
Cheated?
Something unfortunate happened to me before the committee announced its decision.
What?
I was accused of stealing a pre-Columbian Zuni fetish from the museum.
Well... did you?
I loathe Zuni aesthetics.
But by the time
I was cleared, the committee decided in your favor.
Oh.
Well, who was it that accused you?
It was an anonymous tip.
Oh!
I should probably get going.
Susan's waiting at home for me.
Absolutely not.
You're not leaving here until you see what's inside lot 249.
That was the deal.
Edward, why would you buy something like this?
I wasn't born with a silver trust fund in my mouth.
You... You can actually sell this to somebody... for a profit?
What else would I sell it for?
Give me a hand.
My...
God, Andy, it looks just like your father.
Ew!
It stinks like rotten flowers.
Let's see if the embalmers did him any justice.
You're going to unwrap it?
Why not?
All you're looking at is 3,000 years of dry rot.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to...
I'll show you out.
See you later, Andy?
Yeah.
4, 5, over.
6. Two more.
You're back early.
We quit after two sets.
Sounds like we lost to Andy again.
Do you know what your brother is doing right now as we speak?
Huh?
He's unwrapping a mummy!
With Edward Fucking Bellingham!
How much did you tell Andy?
Uh... that... that... that you wrote the essay.
Oh.
Well, that's okay.
He knows I do all your papers anyway.
Oh, and then... and then,
Bellingham casually mentioned that someone dropped an anonymous tip about the stolen...
Pre-Columbian
Zuni fetish?
He's guessing.
Well, maybe, but I think
Andy knows it was you.
Andy's my brother.
He won't do anything.
And Bellingham's a loser.
He can't do anything.
I've really got to get ready for dinner.
Don't you want to see his face?
No. Thank you.
He looks pissed off.
Like he's thinking.
He's not thinking anything.
The first thing the embalmers did was stick a hook up his nose, then drag his brain out through his nostrils.
Here's where they cut him open to remove his innards.
Then they stuff him with flowers and spices.
Here, hold this open.
Come on, hold this open.
Ohh.
Myrrh.
Cassia.
Onions.
And...
What?
Onions and what?
A fortune cookie.
What does it say?
Uh...
I have no idea.
Do you know how to read
Third Kingdom hieroglyphics?
You're taking those books back to the library now?
They're three months overdue.
And I thought I'd stop by to see Andy on the way home.
You don't care about those books or Andy.
You're going to go see Bellingham.
I give him a hard-on.
I'll talk to him, throw him off the track.
Zuni fetish.
Hmm.
They use their second timeout.
I've never
seen Johnny
so enraged by
a defensive play.
He's arguing at
the scorer's table.
They call a technical
on Scott!
"Grow, o light.
"Come forth, o light.
"Rise, o light.
" Ascend, o light.
"O darkness, remove thyself from before him.
"Open his eyes.
That bastard can read that scroll.
"Open, tat.
"Open, nap.
"Open his eyes.
"O darkness, remove thyself from before him.
"Open his eyes.
"The eater of shadows,
"the eater of souls,
"open his eyes.
"Open, tat.
"Open, nap.
Open his eyes."
Oh, jeez!
Hey, Bellingham!
Hey, Bellingham, come on.
The fuse box is right outside your door.
Christ.
Come on, Bellingham.
It's the end of the playoffs.
I mean, Christ.
Oh.
God.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Jesus!
What the hell are you doing here?
I just... I just thought I'd stop by.
What's going on?
Somebody just knocked me down.
Look, you two just wait here.
Don't go after him!
Go after who?
Um... a thief.
Damn fuses.
Well... he couldn't have taken much.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
Did you see him?
No.
Not really, but he did look a little weird.
Yes, he was very weird.
He must've been on drugs.
Got off with my rings.
Roman stuff.
Hollow gold.
At least he didn't get away with lot 249.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Lee!
Lee!
#...With me #
# That's the way
a heart breaks #
# And every man
must pay the price #
# That's the way
a heart breaks #
# You stand before the gates
of paradise #
# Of fire
and ice ##
Shit.
This better be important.
Need any help, Bill?
No. It's a mess, but we got it covered.
Andy.
You busy?
Guess I could use this, huh?
I lied to the police.
I saw who did it.
What?
I saw who killed Lee.
He was thin... and filthy... and stinking.
Like rotten flowers.
Lot 249.
Very few thieves would have the discernment to realize that this was one of the museum's most unusual pieces.
Susan Smith stole that fetish and planted it here.
Oh, my.
What a sensual candlestick.
Take your hands off that.
Good evening,
Mr. Smith.
Dean Murray.
Andy, do you know Dr. Carey, the curator of the university museum?
Uh... hi.
What's going on,
Edward?
I'm a little busy right now, Andy.
Yes.
Mr. Bellingham is packing.
He's leaving the university.
Oh!
Pity.
Would have been a nice acquisition if the mummy had come with it.
What happened to the mummy?
He never did have taste.
I don't care how cheap the psychology is.
I still hate these stupid chrysanthemums.
I'm aware of that, operator.
I've been trying to get through for a half hour.
Help!
Police!
Please, somebody help me!
Susan!
Susan!
Jesus.
Jesus.
Damned fuses.
Hey!
Oh, you're awake.
That's my master's thesis.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm going to start a little fire under your chair and roast your nuts.
Why?
Because you killed my sister and my best friend.
That's why.
I didn't kill them.
Right. Right.
Your friend lot 249 did.
Ah. I thought he'd be back.
The alleged perpetrator's got an airtight alibi.
He's been dead for 3,000 years.
Then these should make for excellent kindling.
Oh, Andy, you're crazy.
Ooh, damn, I think
I forgot my matches.
Grow, grow, o light.
Ascend, o light.
Rise, o light.
Come forth, o light.
O darkness, remove, re...
Shit, how does it go?
Remove thyself from them.
Open, tat. Open, nap.
Open his eyes.
Open his eyes.
Open...
Edward,
I believe in being prepared.
Eh?
Batteries in case those fuses blow again.
Need a hand up there, fella? Huh?
Jesus.
Edward...
I'm not going to apologize for what Lee and Susan did to you.
I won't call the cops either, because what sane person would believe that a 3,000-year-old mummy really did come back to life anyway?
But I do have another idea.
Well, that takes care of that, doesn't it?
Would you untie me, please?
Yeah, of course.
As soon as you tell me where the scroll is.
You don't need the scroll.
It only worked for that mummy, which you've totally destroyed.
The second drawer in the desk on the right.
It's irreplaceable.
Yeah,
I certainly hope so.
That scroll would have made my entire career.
My sister and my best friend died because of this.
Killing me won't bring them back.
If I let you live, that will bring them back?
Don't worry, Andy.
You'll never see me again.
But I'll find a way to keep in touch.
Open, tat.
Open, nap.
Bind them both to my service and to the gods of death, terror... and revenge.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, man, what's so fucking funny?
I was just thinking of this guy I know.
Couldn't distinguish a Third Dynasty sacred scroll from a piece of post-Alexandrian pictogram porn.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Mom, I'll be home as soon as finals are over.
Yeah, the funeral was hard on me, too.
No, the police don't have any leads yet.
All right?
I'll see you next week.
Bye.
Andy?
Bellingham sends his regards.
Antiques are so fascinating.
You told that very well.
Thank you.
Goodness, it's almost 1:00.
We've got to get things started.
You know, if I'm not home by 6:00, they'll come looking.
Looking for what, dear?
Uh... wait.
I'll tell you another story.
Put the book away.
But it's the best story yet.
I stopped reading twice because I got scared.
It's about the old man who's so rich and lives in this big house all by himself.
Okay. This'll be the last story, and you have to make it quick.
I will. I promise.
It's about this old man named Drogan.
Old man Drogan had this big problem, so he hired this man to help him,
a very
professional man.
It's already taken care of, pal.
Here,
Mr. Halston.
Here!
You are Mr. Halston, aren't you?
That's me.
Tell the driver to wait.
The man says you should wait.
For what this guy's paying,
I ain't going nowhere.
Take your time.
In here,
Mr. Halston.
In here.
I want you to make a hit.
That is what you do,
I understand.
How did you get my name?
A Mr. Saul Loggia told me that you know him.
Who do you want hit?
Your victim is right behind you.
I ought to kill you for that.
I don't like jokes.
I don't make jokes.
Sit down.
Here.
Sit down,
Mr. Halston, and look in that envelope.
There will be another 50,000 when you bring me proof that the cat has ended its time on earth.
I don't believe this.
You're hiring me to kill a cat?
That cat has killed three people in this household.
That leaves me.
I need not explain anything, but I will.
In fact, I feel the need to justify myself so you won't think me mad.
This is quite a mansion, don't you think,
Mr. Halston?
Quite a mansion.
Help me up.
Over the years lfilled this place with everything, everything you could want, everything you could ever want.
There used to be four of us living here...
myself
and Carolyn Broadmoor,
the only friend
of my sister Amanda.
And Richard Gage,
a hired man
with the family
almost 20 years.
We were
a dull collection
of rich, old,
unhappy people.
Then...
the cat came.
It was Gage
who saw it first.
He tried repeatedly
to scare it away,
but every time
he drove it off,
it kept coming back.
Finally,
my sister Amanda
noticed the animal.
She's the one
who took it in.
Oh, the poor little thing.
It's starving.
Is Oo hungry, darling?
Is Oo hungry?
Cats aggravate emphysema, Carolyn.
Get rid of the filthy thing.
Cats aggravate my brother, Carolyn.
Don't pay any attention.
I want it out of here!
Either out of here or dead!
Which is it to be?
Don't you ever dare to hurt this cat!
You hate cats.
You always have.
You're wrong.
I don't hate cats.
Cats hate me.
Don't you see?
We're all in danger while this animal's here!
You'll find out!
You'll find out!
You'll...
You all right?
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
You know who I am, don't you?
That is, where my money comes from?
Drogan Pharmaceuticals.
One of the biggest drug companies in America, Mr. Halston.
And the cornerstone of our financial success has always been this.
Tri-Dormal-Phenobarbin, compound "G."
Good old Tri-Dormal-G.
A combination painkiller, tranquilizer... and mild hallucinogen.
Remarkably helpful to those of us fighting the debilitating effects of an aging heart.
It's also remarkably expensive.
It's also remarkably habit-forming.
I've read all about it, Drogan.
That stuff is one step up from street junk.
You've obviously done very well with it.
And you've done well yourself.
Saul Loggia knows of at least two dozen jobs you have done for various members of the professional community.
All right.
We each know who it is we're dealing with.
Tell me the rest of the story about that cat.
Ah, yes.
The cat killed them.
I warned them, but they wouldn't listen.
They found out.
They found out.
My sister
was the first to die.
It was midnight.
She was on her way
to the kitchen
to get that evil beast
some food.
We heard her scream.
Amanda?
Amanda?
What happened, Amanda?
Death by accident,
the coroner said.
But I knew.
Why didn't you get rid of the cat then?
I tried,
Mr. Halston.
I tried.
I'll kill it!
Let me have it!
I'll kill it!
Carolyn locked
the damn thing
in her room.
She became obsessed
with the animal.
I'm going to kill it!
Do you hear me?
I'll kill it!
I'll kill, kill, kill!
My mother told me
that cats like to get babies
and old people
when they're asleep
and steal their breath.
Carolyn died at midnight as well.
Suffocated in her bed.
The coroner said natural causes in her case, but again,
I knew.
What did you do then?
I told Gage to get rid of the vile thing.
It took him almost 24 hours to find the cat and capture it.
Without concern for the time,
I sent him out to Milford to the veterinarian... to have the beast put away once and for all.
I phoned ahead to the vet.
"Mr. Drogan," he said,
"it's midnight."
A week later, the day Dick Gage was buried, the cat came back.
No one actually witnessed any of these deaths.
What makes you think this cat had anything to do with it?
I'm sure it killed them.
It killed them all.
And I'm next!
I'm afraid of it,
Halston.
It skulks around in the shadows, watching me.
It's waiting.
It's torturing me by waiting.
It's been sent to punish me.
I don't get it.
Tri-Dormal-G.
That's what it's about.
It's a synthetic, developed in our laboratories in New Jersey.
Our testing of Tri-Dormal-G was confined almost solely to cats because of the unique quality of the feline nervous system.
How many did you eliminate?
Over four years of testing...
5,000 cats.
5,000 of your buddies get wasted, and they send you back to settle the score with Drogan here, is that the deal, pussycat?
Don't make light of it, Halston.
I warn you.
I never make light of any matter involving $ 100,000.
Then you'll take the job?
I could do it now if you want me to.
I could put my hands around its neck and snap it.
Son of a bitch!
It's not going to be that easy, Mr. Halston.
Don't worry, Drogan.
I'll kill your cat for you.
Good. Kill it, bury it and bring me its tail so I can throw it in the fire and watch it burn.
I'm going into the city.
That's why I made the taxi wait.
There's food, there's liquor, there's everything.
Everything you could want.
Everything you could ever want.
Okay, cat.
It's just you and me now.
Jesus Christ.
Crazy old fucker.
Crazy old rich fucker.
How about it, kitty cat?
"Everything you could ever want."
Why is it rich guys always buy the cheap stuff?
Look at this shit.
Hey, cat!
For me, it's nothing but the best.
All the time.
"Everything you could ever want."
Shit.
Hey, you little motherfucker!
Nobody hits me twice!
No fucking body hits me twice!
Can't get hot.
Can't let yourself get hot, ever.
You make mistakes when you're hot.
What is this?
What is this shit?
Oh, no!
No!
This is a $ 100 shirt.
You'll be sorry you messed with me, you little shit.
I got a reason to kill you now.
Drogan, you cheap bastard.
Come on, kitty cat.
Let's be friends again.
We can go over by the fire like before.
You can sit on my lap again, and I'll give you a nice boost.
This is the real stuff, kitty cat.
Not like that cheap crap
Drogan sells.
What do you say?
You're beating me, pal.
You're beating me good.
I'm trying too hard.
Hey, cat...
I've never blown a hit yet.
It's just a matter of time.
Get away!
Get off of me!
You're done for, you fuck.
The rest of your nine lives are going in one lump sum.
I can outwait you, you little shit.
I've never blown a hit yet, kitty cat.
This is the end of you.
That's impossible.
Fucking impossible!
I had a dead bead on you.
Where are you?
You son of a bitch,
I know you're in here.
Oh, no.
No.
My goodness, that was a scary story.
But my favorites were the love stories.
Uh, yeah. There's one story in that book that's really scary.
But it's a love story, too.
Really?
Yeah.
Which one was that?
The one that's in New York.
You still have to cook for quite a while, but I'd love to hear the story.
"There's a part of New York that's busy during the day,
"but late at night when hardly anyone is around,
"strange things
sometimes happen.
"10 years ago,
on a cold, dreary night,
"an artist named Preston
saw something
very, very strange."
Oh, yes. Wyatt.
Hello.
Preston, it's Jer.
There's a guy here...
Fortyish, anal retentive type, right?
On the money.
Tell him I've been waiting half an hour.
He's been waiting half an hour.
Another Drambuie on the rocks, please.
This one's on him.
Keep it.
Wyatt, I'm sorry.
I was just working on a new piece.
Ah, come here.
Hey, Jer.
Give me a Holsten.
So, did you bring me a check or just a lot of cash?
Thanks, Jer.
Judith says she hasn't moved anything of yours in four months.
Judith Amato.
Big gallery on West Broadway.
If it isn't out by tomorrow, it gets junked.
What? Wyatt, you've got to convince her that l...
I can't convince her of anything.
Wyatt, you're my agent.
Well, not exactly.
Preston, your artistic vision is just not a marketable commodity.
Wyatt, I'm broke.
I can't live on nothing.
And I can't live on 10% of nothing.
You're a monster.
I'm an agent.
For an agent, being a monster is just credentials.
I'm sorry, Preston.
Fuck you!
Jesus, what am I supposed to do now?
Ah, Jesus.
There's Van Gogh.
Degas. Rodin.
They didn't have agents.
How'd they get so successful?
They died.
Time to put it to bed,
Preston.
All right.
What about Maddox?
Let him out in the morning.
That's probably how I'll end up.
Oh, jeez.
You're pissed out of your mind.
Ooh.
I'll take you home.
All right.
Why didn't you do that inside?
I did. It just goes right through.
Oh, my God!
Jer.
Help me.
Help me!
Jesus.
Maddox!
Maddox, open the door!
Help! Maddox, open the door!
Please! Aah!
Please! Please don't!
Your life in exchange for a promise.
You got it.
If I let you go, you must swear you'll never say you saw me.
Never say you heard me speak.
Never tell anyone how I look.
Never repeat what I've said.
A promise forever.
You got to be kidding.
I... I... promise!
Cross your heart?
Ugh.
I promise!
Come here.
No! Oh, God!
Shh! Shut up.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Shh.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Just be quiet, all right?
All right?
I won't hurt you.
Let go of me!
What are you trying to do?
Take a taxi.
You don't see any taxis out here, do you?
If you want one, you can use the phone from my place.
Look, my name is Preston.
I live just around the corner.
Come on.
Come on.
I thought someone was following me back there.
That wasn't me.
Here we are.
What are you doing down here?
I was supposed to meet some friends, but I got lost.
Here you go.
So what were you doing out this late?
I was having an argument.
My agent dumped me tonight.
Police, 16th Precinct.
Hello?
Uh...
Anyone there?
Jerk.
The line's busy.
We'll try again in a minute.
By the way... what's your name?
Carola.
Carola.
Can I have something to drink?
Sure.
So where are you from, anyway?
Colorado.
Sort of.
I had a boyfriend in California.
But... it didn't work out, so I left.
You're the first real artist
I've ever met.
Tell that to my agent.
Did he do that?
I had a run-in with a bottle of scotch.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
Say, did you try that taxi again?
Maybe you should wait till morning.
Good morning.
Last night was very important to me.
It was a nightmare.
Oh, no, Carola!
Not you!
It was everything else until I ran into you.
That part was good.
It was very good.
I needed it.
I need more of it.
I do, too.
Right now.
Oh, yes.
Help me!
Oh, look.
I have to go out for a while.
Wait for me.
Hey, that's my friend!
That's my friend!
I want to go!
Someone cut off his head!
Carola?
Carola?
Yeah. I would've left, too.
Help me!
Yeah.
It's Carola.
Can I come up?
Sure.
Jesus.
I know what you're thinking, but the girl I'm staying with, her boyfriend...
I didn't ask any questions.
I called a friend of mine...
She's a friend of a friend.
She owns a gallery on Houston Street.
That's
House-ton Street.
I told her how wonderful
I thought your work was, so she'd like to come see it.
Does she have a name?
Victorine... but I don't remember the rest.
Roget?
Victorine Roget?
A friend of a friend?
Jesus.
I hope you don't mind.
Victorine Roget... owns the hottest gallery downtown.
Of course
I don't mind!
It's what
I've always wanted.
So how does it feel to be a huge success?
Victorine just sold a piece to a couple for $23,000.
You're a smash.
Well?
Damn.
What?
Preston.
Excuse me.
Hey, Maddox.
Nice work.
Thanks.
I haven't seen you around, pal.
Not since the night Jer died.
I'm Carola.
Nice to meet you.
Who's Jer?
The bartender at this bar...
He died.
In the alley out back.
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, you know something, don't you?
Just sober up, Maddox, before someone puts a match to your breath.
Preston.
I told the cops everything I knew, which is exactly nothing.
Come on.
Promise forever.
So are you sorry you met me?
You take care of me.
Maybe just a little bit...
I take care of you.
Will you take care of me... and my child?
Your child?
Oh, so...
We going to make this little bastard legitimate?
To put it another way... will you marry me?
Will you marry me like this?
Oh, ho ho!
Yes, baby!
No! I'm pregnant!
Come here, sweetie!
No, no, please!
Where are the scissors... scissors?
Mom, look what Wyatt bought for me!
They took our picture a million times.
These kids ran me ragged.
Each has the metabolism of a hummingbird.
Ooh, is there some party tonight that I'm missing?
Yes. Preston and I are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the night we first met.
When you thought he was going to rape you?
Yes, darling.
It's also the night that Wyatt here gave your father the shaft.
I had to murder three other agents before you'd let me represent him again.
And you're still on probation, you mercenary wretch.
Find another agent that'll baby-sit the spawn of hell on a Saturday night.
Wyatt!
Choose your weapon.
10 years.
So many things have changed.
Changed for the better, I hope.
The night I met you,
I almost died.
What do you mean?
Well, let's just say it was the night my life started over again.
So, happy anniversary.
You know, you saved Preston from people like me.
She saved me from myself.
Time to go.
Sincerity is bad for my self-image.
Good night, Wyatt.
Good night,
Wyatt.
Whoa, taxi!
Taxi!
Let's move to the country.
We'll buy a big house with lots of land for the kids.
They'd hate it as much as you would.
Then for you.
There's nothing you could give me that I don't already have.
Yes, there is.
Oh, Christ,
I hate this neighborhood.
Can't get a cab here ever.
No one has ever seen this.
That's what killed Jer.
Then it turned on me.
I knew
I was going to die, but it spoke. It spoke.
It told me it wouldn't kill me if I promised never to tell anybody what I'd seen.
So I never told anybody.
Then why are you telling me?
Because you're the most important thing in my life.
You've brought me
10 years of happiness,
10 years of success,
10 years of a perfect life.
I'm telling you because I love you.
You deserve everything
I can give you, and I've never given you the truth about what happened the night we met.
What's wrong?
I'm not making this up.
I'm telling you the truth.
You promised you'd never tell!
Ohh!
Oh, God.
You broke your promise, you idiot!
I loved you!
Ugh!
Jesus, please...
Carola, stop it!
Just change back.
I can't.
No.
No!
What's wrong with the kids?
Stop it!
It's too late.
You betrayed your vow.
It can't be!
No!
I'm so sorry.
Carola...
I loved you.
And I loved you, too, but you broke your vow, and that sealed our destiny.
Yo!
Raarrr!
What the hell was that?
I don't want to know.
My goodness, you really did keep the best one for last.
No. I saved the really, really best one for now.
You should have told me the really, really best story before,
'cause now it's too late.
It's the best one because there's a happy ending, a really happy ending.
The stories in that book don't have happy endings.
But you got to hear this story.
This kid, his name's Timmy...
That's nice, dear.
And Timmy's older brother had this paper route.
One day, when
Timmy's brother got sick,
Timmy had to go collecting.
Timmy went to this one house, and this lady at the door said, "Come in."
He went inside, and she threw him into a pantry.
She made him eat cookies to get fat
'cause she was going to kill him and eat him!
This is your story, and we both know how it comes out.
But you don't. Something really weird happens.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Uh, Timmy had these marbles in his pocket, and they were all shiny and slippery.
When he threw them on the floor... she didn't see where they went... and she slipped!
Timmy saw his chance to escape... if he could just reach the keys!
Don't you just love happy endings?
Whoo-hoo!
- Come on, we're outta here!
- Easy, Rocky.
All right, guys, we're 15 seconds from the drop zone.
All right, pinheads, the Stealth Eagle's about to fly.
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Well, lead on, flyboys.
- That's a lotta air!
- After you, Skull!
What are you? Crazy? This was your idea!
Hey, guys. You might wanna slip those on.
Good idea.
We're three seconds away from the target zone. Aisha, you're on!
Yes!
Stylin'!
On your tail! Whoo!
All systems go!
Banzai!
Whoo-hoo!
- Show 'em your stuff.
- You got it. Surf's up!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Catch you on the flip side.

PA: With the arrival of Ryan"s Comet two days away, the Angel Grove jump-a-thon will breathe new life into the old observatory.
Tickets to see the comet are at the Fire Department booth.
Now, folks, raise your eyes to the skies, cos here comes the team from Angel Grove High!
All right, Dad, pay close attention.
This is how the pros do it.
- I didn't do so bad.
- You landed in the parking lot.
- It was embarrassing.
- Well...
PA: The first of the team is beginning his final approach. It"s Adam!
As he rounds the turn, he looks awful low... but he pulls up just in time and hits the target dead centre.
Right behind him is skydiver Billy... who manages a perfect landing!
Skydiver number three is Kimberly!
Her landing is flawless!
And here comes Rocky... who lands right on target!
Here comes Aisha! She makes it a perfect five out of five landing and ties the 1986 record.
So now it"s all up to Tommy Oliver.
Can he make it six for six?
Yeah! Go, Tommy!
PA: He"s making his final approach.
Looks a bit wide, but still OK.
Almost to the ground now. Can he do it?
He does! The Angel Grove team sets a new city record! Way to go, guys!
- Let's go.
- OK.
PA: Remember, folks, Ryan"s Comet will be passing in just two days.
- Looking good up there.
- Thanks. Maybe next time you can join us.
Really? Could l?
Yeah, well, we'll talk about that, Fred... in about 10 or 1 2 years, all right?
Congratulations, Tommy.
The observatory just got a new lease on life.
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- FRED: Awesome.
- Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days!
- Guys, we did it!
- That was awesome, Tommy.
- Wonderful.
- Thanks, guys. You too, man.
- Hey, has anybody seen Bulk and Skull?
Ernie's is serving a free dessert with lunch.
They probably landed on the roof.
- PILOT: Hurry up. We're runnin' out of fuel.
- BULK: I gotta be the eagle.
I'm gonna be the eagle!
Be the swallow!
- Be the swallow.
- Come on, baby!
- BULK: Let go of me!
- SKULL: I want my mommy!
TOMMY: Rock and roll!
# The mountain is high #
# The valley is low #
# And you're confused on which way to go #
# So I've come here to give you a hand #
# And lead you into the promised land #
- Air time!
- Up and away!
# Come on and take it be my side #
# Come on and take a tree ride #
- Let's take a shortcut.
- Right behind you!
# Come on and take a free ride #
# Come on and take it by my side #
SKULL: Hey, this doesn't look like the target landing zone! Where's the free food?
You idiot! Your screaming threw off the Stealth Eagle's sense of direction.
Stealth Eagle? Lame duck is more like it.
- Hey!
- Uh-oh.
- You guys, what do you think you're doing?
- Uh...
We're from the Angel Grove
Building lnspector's office.
Yeah. That building's supposed to be over there!
And what's that man doing without proper foot protection?
- Who's in charge around here, huh?
- Huh?
- Huh?
- Huh?
Hey, Dave! Come and have a look at this.
Go on, Dave.
- That was a close one.
- Uh-huh.
- You hungry?
- Always.
What in the world is this?
It sure as heck ain't DWP.
Let's get a crane in here.
OK, take it up!
Incredible.
What do you think it is?
No... idea.
Aaaaarrgghh!
John, you all right?
ROCKY: Let's get somethin' to eat.
TOMMY: Hang on.
Let's go over there.
- What's up, Alpha?
- Rangers, Zordon needs you. It"s urgent.
We're on our way.
Aye-yai-yai-yai! The subtronic interphasers are short-circuiting.
I have to find a way to alternate the frequency modulators.
What's goin' on?
A massive surge of evil energy is overloading our sensors. Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!
Rangers, you must act swiftly.
- The planet is in grave danger.
- Danger from what?
6,000 years ago a morphological being known as lvan Ooze ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror.
He was on the verge of completing construction of his ultimate weapons: the Ecto-Morphicon Titans, twin machines capable of enslaving the entire universe.
What happened to him?
A group of warriors like yourselves lured him to into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground.
But now the chamber has been accidentally uncovered.
You must return it to the depths before it is opened and lvan is released.
His Ecto-Morphicons were buried near the chamber. If lvan escapes, he'll find them.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You're dealing with an evil that is beyond all imagination.
- What do I care about some stupid egg?
- This is no ordinary egg!
- Well, I say we hard-boil the thing!
- I'm with her. I'm hungry.
- That's cos you're a pig!
- Hey, Kurt, take a look at this.
No need to wake him. In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself?
PIG: Yeah, I could do that.
I just choose not to.
Zip your lips.
After 2,000 years of searching... you are finally within my grasp.
And now... Iet's crack this egg.
Excellent.
Yuck!
What?! You spent 2,000 years looking for a tub of snot?!
Patience, motor-mouth. Watch.
Yes!
Cool!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The Ooze is back!
Yeah!
- He's so handsome!
- Why, thank you.
I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent.
- It is a supreme honour to finally meet you.
- How can I ever repay you?
Do you recall the name Zordon of Eltar?
I think he's heard of him.
I want you to destroy Zordon... so that my evil may once again reign supreme!
I will not only destroy him...
I will obliterate his entire legacy.
It will be as if Zordon of Eltar never existed!
- Finally, a real man!
- ( growls )
We shall leave you to weave your evil ways.
Let's go, Rita.
What is that odious stench?
Smells like... teenagers.
Anybody see anything?
Let's take a look up there.
Ugh!
- AISHA: What is it?
- ROCKY: It reeks.
Hey! What are you kids doin' here?
You haven't seen a morphological being lurking around here?
- A morphological being?
- Yeah.
What the heck is that?
Wait a second.
Did it look something like this?
- Ew, gross!
- Too kind. Allow me to introduce myself.
I am the galactically feared, globally reviled, universally despised...
They call me lvan Ooze.
Well, pack your bags, cos we're sending you back where you came from.
Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.
Not much has changed in 6,000 years.
You obviously don't know who you're dealing with, Mr Raisin Head.
- Really?
- Yeah. We're the Power Rangers.
Where's my autograph book? Ha!
Power Rangers, huh?
So Zordon's still usin' a bunch of kids to do his dirty work.
Well... meet my kids!
Ew.
From this moment forth the world as you know it shall cease to exist!
Welcome to my nightmare!
Bye-bye, kiddies!
He's gone.
- What are we gonna do?
- ROCKY: There's plenty of room down there.
Go, guys!
- Let's take these beasts!
- Spread out!
Welcome to my nightmare.

- AISHA: They got us cornered!

- BILLY: There's too many of 'em.
- Let's do it, guys! It's morphin' time!
Pterodactyl!
Triceratops!
Tyrannosaurus!
Mastodon!
Sabre-toothed tiger!
White tiger!
# Go, go, Power Rangers #
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

- Where'd they go?
- Keep your eyes peeled.
Heads up, guys! Over there!
- Careful. It could be a trap.
- Right.
Let's go.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late.
- lvan is on his way here.
- Don't worry.
Nobody enters the command centre without a power coin.
Well, almost nobody.
Hey, pretty fancy-schmancy.
I guess if you invest your money well over 60 centuries, you can buy something pretty nice.
Uh-oh.
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai....
You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself.
Put a sock in it, Z! 10 minutes out of the egg and I'm listening to one of your lectures.
You locked me into your stuffy hyperlock chamber and tossed me away in the depths like yesterday's trash.
You any idea what it's like to be locked up in a rotten egg for 6,000 years? It's boring.
Not to mention I've had a charley horse since the Renaissance.
- You won't get away with this, Ooze.
- You robbed me of my prime.
I was the supreme ruler of the most foul empire in the universe.
And now... it's time to pay the piper.
Oh, the things that I have missed!
The Black Plague!
The Spanish lnquisition!
The Brady Bunch reunion!
- BILLY: This place gives me the creeps.
- AISHA: I heard that.
TOMMY: I've got a bad feelin' about this place.
- KIMBERLY: Anybody see anything?
- We need some light.
Activating power beam.
- They gotta be around here somewhere.
- Activating power scope.
TOMMY: Talk to me, Rocky. What do we got?
I don't know what these purple creeps are made of, but I can't lock 'em down.
TOMMY: All right. Stay alert.
- Over there!
- Let's power up!
- ALL: Right!
- AISHA: Here they come!
You guys make me sick, sick, sick!
Back off!
Have a nice flight!
Later, dudes.
It's gonna be one messy night.
- Up and over?
- Let's do it!
ADAM: Rocky, behind you!
Goin' airborne!
These guys don't know when to quit.
Double whammy?
You're on.
Uh-oh!
Whoaaaa!
That does it. Stegastinger!
Did you miss me?
Pterodactyl Thunderwhip!
Have a nice trip! See you next fall.
Bye-bye.
Gotta love it.
Hold on, Aisha!
One, two, three, four, five, six!
Aisha!
- You OK?
- They're tough.
- Let's finish these purple parasites.
- You said it.
I want you guys to meet Saba.
ALL: Uh-oh!
ALL: Yeah!
TOMMY: Now let's go find lvan.
KIMBERLY: Hey, what's happening?
BILLY: We're losing power.
- What's goin' on?
- Alpha, come in.
- Something's wrong.
- We'd better get back. Let's go, guys.
BILLY: Oh, no.
- Ooze.
- TOMMY: Let's get it open.
TOMMY: Look at this place.
TOMMY: I can't believe it.
AISHA: What happened here?
KIMBERLY: Oh, no.
ADAM: Zordon!
What's happening to him?
Outside of his time warp, he's dying.
BILLY: He needs power.
Rangers.
Thank goodness you are safe.
Come on, we gotta get you back inside.
I'm afraid that is impossible.
The power has been destroyed.
It is gone.
The Zords... the weapons... all of it.
The Power Rangers are no more.
Ivan Ooze has won.
- We're losing him.
- Zordon, you can't leave us!
Ever since you came into our lives, you've been like a father to us all.
You must be strong.
Rangers!
TOMMY: Alpha.
- Are you OK?
- I'll be fine.
There may be a power that can save Zordon.
- What power?
- It is on the distant planet of Phaedos.
It's very dangerous.
All who have tried for it have perished.
- But we have to try, Alpha.
- Zordon's life force will not last long.
- You won't have much time.
- How can we get it?
Maybe if I can download the last plasmatic morphing gem into the transport core,
I might have just enough power to get you there.
- But there won't be any left to get you back.
- So, how do we get back?
We have to hope that the power is there.
Zordon's life depends on it.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
We may not have our powers, but we're still the Power Rangers.
Remember, Rangers,
Zordon doesn't have much time.
Oh, no! Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!
Please hold on, Zordon!
I can't believe it! How could he let them slip through his hands?!
He's no better than the rest of the hired help!
Oh, give it a rest.
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- You egg-sucking purple pinhead!
The Rangers are going after the great power!
I thought you said this guy was the master of disaster!
He's nothing but a slime-infested jelly doughnut!
Finally someone shut her up.
Your feebleness is staggering.
You obviously need a vacation.
I think circumstances force us to choose a new leader... and I pick... me!
Who does this clown think he's dealing with?
The bogeyman is taking over.
No one double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!
Oh, stop it! It tickles!
My turn.
- RITA: (squeaky voice) Way to go, bonehead!
- ZEDD: You can't trust anyone in this galaxy!
- I love snow globes.
- RITA: Earthquake! Earthquake!
Now you have a choice. You either serve me... or you can join these insufferable dingledorks!
- Goldar, get us out of here!
- Don't listen to that purple booger!
ZEDD: Don't you dare betray me!
- We never liked those dingledorks.
- PIG: You said it. They stink.
So... what are we going to do about the Power Rangers, oh my hideous one?
Ah, yes.
The Power Rangers.
- Good distance.
- Yeah.
Shut your beaks! Now, my Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, you will find the Power Rangers and you will tear them apart!
- GOLDAR: Go sic 'em, Tweety!
- PIG: Happy hunting!
Wow.
My gosh. Look at this place.
AISHA: You guys! Over here! Quick!
AISHA: Whoa. Looks like somebody had a bad day.
- What is it?
- I think the question is "What was it?"
Definitely not the welcoming committee, that's for sure.
Come on, guys, we got a job to do.
Taking over the world is one thing.
Finding good help to run it for you, that's the killer.
Would you like me to make a few calls?
No need. I'm going to recruit the parents of Angel Grove.
No offence, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Well, I suppose you'd be the experts on that.
- You forget. I'm a master of disguise.
- How could I forget? I never knew.
First I'll turn them into zombies and then order them to dig up my Ecto-Morphicons.
How you gonna do that?
By showing them the wonders of being wicked with a little bit of lvan's ooze.
Ooh!
Finally I get to finish what I started 6,000 years ago!
Little do they know my weapons of destruction lie buried beneath their feet.
- Stop it! Get to work!
- PIG: Yes, Your Royal Heinous Highness.
Hey.
You OK?
I was just thinking about Zordon.
You know, everything we've been through together.
Look, he's gonna make it.
We'll find this power and then send that slimeball lvan Ooze back to the sewer he crawled out of.
Come on.
What the heck was that?
BILLY: Get down!
TOMMY: Let's move!
ROCKY: Look out!
They're everywhere!
Take cover!
Back off.
- Know the funny thing about morphin'?
- What?
You don't appreciate it till you can't do it!
TOMMY: Kimberly, behind you!
Hang on, Kimberly!
Somebody help me!
- They're too strong!
- We need our powers!
Let me go, Big Bird!
That was amazing. Thanks.
If you want to thank me, go back to wherever it is you came from.
- We can't.
- We were told there was a great power here.
- Is it true?
- Yes.
The ground is littered with the bones of those who have tried for it and failed.
Well, we're different. We won't fail.
Leave Phaedos... before it's too late.
Look, we don't want any trouble.
Our leader Zordon got hurt...
Zordon?
Did you say Zordon?
You know Zordon? Who are you?
I am Dulcea, master warrior of the planet Phaedos.
What has happened to Zordon?
He was attacked by this cosmic being named lvan Ooze.
- lvan Ooze is free?
- You've heard of him?
Ivan Ooze is a monster.
If we don't hurry, your planet is doomed.
Follow me.
Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers.
Please, Zordon, save your strength.
You need to rest.
We must try to communicate with them.
It is possible I can help them.
If I could locate a vertical deflector, we could make contact through the viewing globe.
Please... please hurry.
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Hold on.
Guys and girls, girls and guys, gather round and feast your eyes.
I promise you all, you just can't lose, when you've got your own supply of lvan's ooze.
- BOY: What are we supposed to do with it?
- Show it to parents, show it to friends.
When you've got your ooze, the fun never ends.
This is kinda gross.
You may have heard that looks can be deceiving.
I'm sure that when you've tried it, you all will be believing.
And did I mention it's free?
- I'll take some.
- Here you go. Who else?
OK, there's enough for everybody.
Take it home in boxes, take it home in cases.
If your parents try to stop you, just throw it in their faces!
BILLY: Dulcea, where are you taking us?
You shall know soon enough.
KIMBERLY: We have to hurry.
Zordon won't last much longer.
TOMMY: Wow.
- AISHA: Amazing.
- TOMMY: What is this place?
DULCEA: These are the ancient ruins of the Ninjetti Temple.
There, beyond the Niola Jungle, is the monolith.
Inside awaits the power of the universe.
The monolith is heavily guarded against intruders.
No one has ever survived an attempt to reach it.
Then how can we?
You were chosen by Zordon.
I have faith in his wisdom.
Can you help us?
We will call upon the sacred animals of the Ninjetti for help.
Fred!
There, that should do it. Let's give it a whirl!
Police have been fielding hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing parents continues to grow.
Hi, folks. Ivan Ooze here.
Are you bored with your work?
Are you bored with your life? Then come on down to Ooze City and let"s get sticky!
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!
Ivan's evil plot is taking shape.
I just hope they're not too late.
Buried deep within each of us is an animal spirit waiting to be released.
Close your eyes and look deep inside.
Aisha, you are the bear, fierce and unstoppable.
Rocky, powerful, smart, you are the mighty ape.
Billy, you are the wolf, cunning and swift.
Agile Kimberly, light as a feather, you are the crane.
Adam...
- Adam, what's wrong?
- I'm a frog.
Yes, a frog. Like the one you kiss... to get a handsome prince.
And you, Tommy, are the falcon, winged lord of the skies.
To be in harmony with a sacred animal spirit is to have the force of the Ninjetti.
To those who are Ninjetti, anything is possible.
But... I am afraid you must do this on you own.
You're not coming with us, Dulcea?
If only I could.
One step beyond this plateau and I would begin to age as rapidly as Zordon is now.
The strength is inside you. Trust it.
Your sacred animals will be your guide.
May your animal spirits watch over you.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad? Where are you?
IVAN: I forgot how slow parents are.
I thought my Ecto-Morphicons would be dug up by now.
Oh, Goldie, I'm bored.
Let's have some fun. Hey, you!
Dance.
Do the swim.
- Ballet!
- (ballet music)
Hey.
Hey, boss! They're back!
Ah!
My Tengu.
Stop your screeching.
- How did you fare?
- It couldn't have gone better.
Threw one of 'em off a mountain, one into a ragin' river.
So, they've all been destroyed?
- Well, we were about to destroy them, but...
- What?
You didn't kill them? You call yourself Tengu warriors? You're more like Tengu turkeys!
I'll have you all stuffed and roasted!
But, master, there was this monster with these huge sticks and it kept twirling them...
Sticks? Did these sticks have a whistling sound?
It was more like nails on a chalkboard.
Dulcea.
That miserable, manipulating, loathsome she-devil of a witch!
If she leads them to the great power, everything will be ruined.
- Do you want us to take another whack at it?
- How about takin' another quack at it?
No time to waste. My Ecto-Morphicon machines must be unearthed by sundown.
It's time.
BILLY: Man, this jungle goes on for ever.
TOMMY: We've gotta keep movin', guys.
Zordon's time is runnin' out.
Dad!
Dad!
Hey, Dad!
Dad, what's wrong with you?
It's me - Fred.
Dad, we gotta get outta here!
Hey, you!
Get back to work!
PIG: Yeah! Pick up those rocks!
Tote that barge! Lift that bale!
GOLDAR: Put your weak backs into it!
PIG: Yeah, I had a weak back about a week back.
Feast your eyes on the exoskeleton of the Barbaric Hornitor!
The Dreaded Scorpitron should be close by.
Once my lovely little Ecto-Morphicon machines are up and running, spreading ooze throughout the world,
I shall annihilate Angel Grove, and then... the universe!
PIG: # We're takin' over the world!
We're takin' over the world #
- AISHA: What is this place?
- BILLY: Looks like some kind of graveyard.
- KIMBERLY: I wonder what happened.
- ADAM: Personally, I'd rather not find out.
- Welcome to Jurassic Park.
- AISHA: Very funny, Adam.
TOMMY: Aisha, get outta there!
Rocky!
Uh-oh.
Wait for me!
- Tommy!
- Hang on!
Tommy!
All right, bonehead!
- Tommy, hang on!
- Whoa! Whoa!
Tommy!
Whoa!
Hold on tight, Tommy!
Yo, fossil head!
I've got a bone to pick with you!
Huh? Whoa!
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Biology finally paid off for you, huh?
We should get outta here before he pulls himself together.
Yeah.
GOLDAR: You there! Let's show a little initiative! And you, get your rear in gear!
Pick up the pace! We haven't got all day!
- Hey, boss, construction is completed.
- PIG: Yeah, when's lunch?
Parents of Angel Grove!
You have completed my Ecto-Morphicons!
But, frankly, I'm sick of your ugly faces and your dull personalities.
- Yeah!
- (giggles/snorts)
You will return to the construction site and leap to your doom.
- Leap to your doom.
- Bye-bye.
- GOLDAR: Bye-bye!
- GOLDAR: Aloha!
GOLDAR: Arrivederci!
- Dad!
- IVAN: Hasta la vista, baby.
GOLDAR: See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!
Ciao.
See ya later, alligator.
Finally, the moment of truth!
Mordant, let the ooze flow!
Comin' right up.
Ooze, give my creatures life!
Life, I tell you! Life!
Excellent!
Now my machines will destroy the city!
ADAM: Wow.
Hey, guys, check this out.
BILLY: lncredible.
Let's go, guys. Nice and easy.
What do you think?
Wait here.
Tommy!
- What now?
- Ninjetti!
- Falcon!
- The frog!
- The ape!
- The crane!
- The wolf!
- Bear!
These things are made of rock.
These guys are strong.
Yikes.
Back off, boulder breath!
Hang tight, Adam!
Ever play leapfrog?
- Adam!
- Hang on, Rocky!
Hey, lava head!
Thanks, Adam. Thought I was finished.
That's one down, and three to go.
Whoa!
Somebody help!
Let's talk about this.
Guess not.
Come on, roll!
Hang on, Kimberly!
They're strong, but they're not too smart.
Help me push.
Right.
KIMBERLY: Let's rock his world.
What is this, pick-on-the-frog day?
- Hey, Adam, could you use a hand?
- The thought crossed my mind.
Adam!
Elevator goin' up.
BILLY: Elevator goin' down.
Talk about a splitting headache.
Whoa! That was close.
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.
Go!
Ninjetti corkscrew kick!
Eightball, corner pocket!
What now?
- Whoa. What's happening?
- TOMMY: Look.
The great power.
The sacred animals.
ROCKY: New Zords!
- We did it!
- Our morphers are on line.
- We got the power!
- Hang on, Zordon!
- We're on our way.
- Let's do it.
DULCEA: Good luck, Rangers.
Citizens of Angel Grove, how do you like my friends, huh?
The boys are back in town!
Long live the King of Ooze!
The mayor has declared a state of emergency.
He"s asked that the city be immediately evacuated.
Angel Grove has never before known...
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Ivan's evil machines are destroying Angel Grove!
Alpha... keep trying.
TV: Where are the Power Rangers?
I love the smell of destruction in the evening.
Me, too.
What's that smell?
Inconceivable.
The Power Rangers!
- Oh, man! Look at this mess.
- This is lvan's handiwork.
- Let's get back to the command centre.
- Wait. What was that?
I think we're about to find out. Look!
- Whoa. What is that thing?
- lvan's been busy while we were away.
Whoa!
- What's that?
- AISHA: There's another one.
KIMBERLY: And it's even uglier.
- Whoa.
- We've gotta stop these things.
- We've got new Ninja Zords. Let's use 'em!
- Right!
Ninja crane Zord!
Ninja wolf Zord!
Ninja frog Zord!
Ninja ape Zord!
Ninja bear Zord!
Ninja falcon Zord!
GOLDAR: Uh-oh!
- Check it out!
- Ninja Zords!
Cool!
- Yes!
- Awesome!
Oh, no! It's the Zords!
Ah, Zords, schmords.
I'll crush 'em like roaches.
- Let's do it!
- Right! Ninja Zords power up!
Ready to ride. Yes!
- All systems on line.
- Activating weapon systems.
- Nice stereo.
- We're outta here!
(parents chanting) Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble #
# Something's come along and it's burst our bubble #
# Yeah, yeah #
Hey, everyone!
Listen up! You all think this is one big party, don't you?
- Yeah!
- Well, you've all been brainwashed.
Ivan's taking over the planet and he's using all of us in his plans!
- And he's got our parents.
- What are you talking about?
Look, lvan Ooze is evil.
And if you don't come with me right now, our parents are gonna die! You gotta believe me!
TOMMY: Rangers, I'm over the east quadrant.
My sensors are pickin' up a disturbance.
I'm goin' in.
Somebody call for an exterminator?
I've got a lock.
Rockets away!
I've been hit! I'm pullin' out!
Don't worry, Tommy, Frog Zord is in position.
We got 'em now, boss.
Touch me again, you'll be chicken wings in the morning.
ADAM: Tongue-tied and twisted.
Yee-hah!
Bad move, sparky.
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned.
- I need backup!
- BILLY: l"m on my way!
Wolf Zord approaching target.
Keep him tied up. I'm loading hydraulics.
ADAM: I'm losin' him!
Here goes!
All right! Got him.
Time to boogie with the bear.
Whoa!
I've been hit hard!
Ape Zord locked on target.
Yee-hah!
Ride 'em, cowboy!
- Hang in there, Rocky!
- I'm hangin'! I'm hangin'!
FRED: Come on! We'll take the monorail!
Let's get down to the construction site!
All right, guys,
I've got a lock on the ooze man.
Ah!
Here comes that cute little Pink Ranger to the rescue.
Oh, you think she's cute too, huh?
- One order of toasted slime comin' up.
- So, you wanna play, huh?
Ivan's got me in an electromagnetic deadlock!
I can't break free!
TOMMY: Hang on, Kimberly!
I'm getting airsick up here!
My stabilisers have ruptured!
I can't hold on much longer!
- I'm burning up in here!
- AISHA: Kimberly, use your thrusters!
Right! Now, which button?
Aaaaaggghhh!
- I'll deal with you later.
- Yeah, later.
Ah. Oozed.
I'm losing my grip!
I can't hold on much longer!
Falcon Zord is back in the game.
Adam, disengage. I've got a clear shot!
He's all yours.
All right, big guy, it's lights out for you.
Rockets away!
- He's outta there!
- Target neutralised. Let's get the other one.
He's too strong! I can't take him down!
Everybody close in. This street's a dead end.
IVAN: They've destroyed my beautiful creation.
Now I'm beginning to get really angry!
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
IVAN: I feel big again!
Go get 'em, booger man!
Whoa. Somebody call a plastic surgeon.
Oh, no!
I'm outta here!
Time for a little swordplay.
- He destroyed the monorail track.
- We need Ninja Megazord power now!
Ninja Megazord, power up!
Monorail's in trouble.
I'll complete docking sequence later.
KIMBERLY: We"ll take care of lvan.
# Go, go, Power Rangers #
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #
Crane Zord locked on.
Checking out.
Ninja battle mode now!
- Activating Ninja Megazord battle mode.
- Power Sword, now!
Shall we tango?
- Oh, no.
- What is that?
- The track's broken!
- Oh, no!
Hang on, kids.
- Falcon Zord is comin' in for a landin'.
- Everybody hang on!
All right! Yeah! Whoo!
Good luck, kids.
Power Sword has been destroyed.
- Pressure's dropping!
- Negative control!
- Tommy, we need your help!
- Hang tight, guys. I'm on my way.
- Everybody hang on!
- IVAN: Next stop, Angel Grove First National.
Whoaaa!
ADAM: Brace for impact!
- All systems down!
- He's closing in!
- Tommy, get your butt down here!
- Comin' in to complete the sequence.
Ninja Falcon Megazord!
Let's get Ooze outta here before he destroys everything.
- I'll set a course for outer space.
- Good idea.
Let's do it!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Yee-hah!
(chanting) Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
It's our parents!
You guys try and stop them.
And you two come with me.
- Guys, I think I know a way to get rid of lvan.
- Really? How?
- Ryan's Comet.
- Billy, that's brilliant!
- What?
- We get lvan in the comet's path...
And kaboom! He's space dust.
- All right, guys, main thrusters.
- Right!
- We can't hold 'em back!
- We have to keep on trying!
Turn it on!
Well, if it isn't that double-dealing dough head!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of my misery!
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!
We're approaching the comet's coordinates.
All right, guys, this is it.
We'll wait here and lure him in.
I'm gonna rip you apart Zord by Zord.
TOMMY: Here he comes. Brace yourselves!
- Micropressure's in the red!
- We're imploding!
Bearing 009. We're in the comet's trajectory.
We need to break free.
IVAN: Have you hugged your Zords today?
- Here it comes!
- We have to break his grip!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
- What are you doing?
- Taking care of business.
- We're outta here.
- Right!
Oh, no.
Yeah.
- Skull!
- Bulk...
Dad!
- Fred!
- Dad!
I love you, son.
Alpha!
Rangers, you made it!
But... I'm afraid you're too late.
BILLY: Too late?
This can't be happening.
Remember what we learnt?
To those who possess the great power, all things are possible.
Come on.
Zordon!
Rangers!
He's alive! He's alive! He's alive!
- We thought that you had...
- It is good to see you again, too.
- SKULL: We were awesome.
- BULK: lncredible!
Ivan and his 50-foot monsters had us surrounded.
- There was no escape.
- We knew we were facing death in the eye.
- We could smell death's breath.
- And death could use a mint.
Can you believe those guys?
I'm so hungry.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Fred!
- Hey! Rumour has it you're quite the hero.
- That's my man!
I helped a bit.
The Power Rangers did most of the work.
Hey, things got tough, you didn't panic.
You, my friend, demonstrated true bravery.
It's like what you taught me about martial arts: use your head, and above all, stay calm.
I heard you're in line to be a Ranger yourself one of these days.
- Nah, that's impossible.
- Hey, anything's possible.
- You really think so?
- I know so.
- Fred Kelman, the Silver Ranger.
- It does have a certain ring to it.
Fred Kelman the Gold Ranger.
Check it out!
# We'll get higher and higher #

- Power Rangers?
- Bulk and Skull!

Hey! Watch it, will ya?
Finally got my hair the way I like it.
I'm so excited, Fred.
I'm gonna be a father.
It's like a dream come true.
A son. Someone to carry on the proud name of Rubble.
Think I'll be a good daddy, Fred?
Well, you're bound to find something you're good at.
Yeah, sure... Hey!
- Uncle!
- Heh, heh, heh.
You know, Fred, Betty and
I really owe it all to you.
We would've never qualified to adopt had it not been for the money you gave us.
Remember, Barn, that's between you and me.
I'd like to tell the world what a great guy my best buddy is!
No, no, no!
True, it was a selfless, noble act, if I do say so myself.
My only reward will be your happiness.
I don't need to go blabbin' my good deeds all around.
You're afraid to tell
Wilma, aren't you?
Afraid? Now, let's get this straight, Rubble.
I don't need permission from my wife to make a decision.
In my cave, I reign supreme!
Su-preme!
- I won't tell her, Fred.
- Thanks, pal.
Hiya, Timmy!
Here you go! Shoot, shoot, shoot!
Hey, Charlie!
- Huh?
- Wilma!
I'm home!
No, Dino! No, no! No, Dino! Bad boy!
Bad dog!
- Good doggie!
- Bad Dino breath.
Fred!
Do you have to get Dino so wound up when you come home?
It's not my fault. Maybe he'd calm down if we had him fixed!
What?
Here comes the big Daddysaurus!
How was your day, dear?
I think my Brontocrane's pregnant again.
I tell ya, you forget to lock her up one Saturday night...
- Comfortable, Fred?
- On my way.
All I need's a brew and a good scratch.
Which one do you want to do first?
It does my heart good to see you relaxing after a hard day at the quarry.
I'm telling you, I married the pick of the litter.
Fred, our garbage disposal has been acting up a lot lately, so I decided that it was time to buy a new one.
But when I went to take money out of our savings account...
- Guess what?
- New garbage disposal?
New garbage disposal? Why throw good money down the drain?
There's nothing wrong with this one.
All right, you. Say "ahh."
Uh-uh.
Do you have any idea why there's no money in our savings account?
There's your problem right there.
All right, you! Spit it out!
Where's the money, Fred?
Something happened to it.
There, I said it.
We have scrimped and saved for that money.
And every time we get ahead, you have to go blow it on some hare-brained scheme!
Now, see here, Wilma!
In this cave, I am the king!
- And...
- And what, Fred?
And you have every right to know, my queen.
I gave it to Barney.
You what?
I know I should've consulted you, but Barney Rubble's my neighbor, my lodge brother and my best friend since the first time I went through the fifth grade!
Fred Flintstone!
Wilma, without that money, they wouldn't be allowed to adopt a baby.
So go ahead, yell, scream, let the fur fly.
Give the neighbors something to talk about!
What you have just done for the Rubbles...
Is the sweetest, most generous thing I ever heard.
And I adore you for it.
Mmm.
I also bought a new bowling ball.
Wait! Come on, honey!
- Watch your step.
- Sit down.
All right, all together, folks.
Betty, sit down and relax.
Oh, I can't, Wilma. It just hit me.
From now on, I'll be spending 24 hours a day attending to the every need of a helpless little boy.
Then again, maybe it won't be such a big adjustment after all.
Fred!
And promise you won't say anything like you did when you saw my sister's baby.
The kid had a tail. Was I supposed to pretend I didn't notice?
Hello, Mommy and Daddy! I have someone who wants to meet you!
Well, it's not exactly what we pictured, but...
- We'll love him like he was our own.
- No, no, no.
This little fellow belongs to the Hendersons.
- So glad you'll be nursing.
- Congratulations.
Mr. and Mrs. Rubble, this is your little boy.
Barney, isn't he precious?
Precious? They'd have been better off with the monkey.
Fred!
- Does he have a name?
- Bamm-Bamm.
- Is that short for somethin'?
- Bamm-Bamm-Bamm.
You'll have to take it slowly with this one.
He doesn't speak yet, and he's a little skittish around humans.
But then again, I would be too if I had been raised by wild mastodons.
Mastodons?
Let's not nitpick.
A mammal's a mammal.
Well, sounds to me like all he needs is a little lovin'.
Ohh.
Come here, little guy.
Aah! He growled.
It's cute.
It's okay, little guy.
I'm your da-da.
Bamm-Bamm!
Oh! Barney!
- Oh, Betty!
- Bamm-Bamm! No!
Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm, wait!
Stalactite, stalagmite
Hold your baby very tight
- Come back!
- Come here, little guy!
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!
- Ohhh!
Rock with the caveman
Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm!
Roll with the caveman
Shake to the caveman
Break with the caveman
Oof!
Make with the caveman
Okay, give me a C-A-V-E
Whoa!
M-A-N, Caveman
Whoa!
What an arm!
"And Cinderocka married the handsome prince, and...
"And they lived happily ever after."
Yeah!
Okay, Brother Flintstone, we need a strike to win.
Can you do it?
Is the Earth flat?
- Come on, Freddie!
- Come on, hit it!
Come on, twinkle toes.
Fred!
- Waka-waka-woo!
- Waka-waka-woo!
- Wooga-wooga-wee!
- Wooga-wooga-wee!
Piki-piki-piki! Poki-poki-poki!!
Ahhhhhhhh-oooh!
Lava juice!
Hey, can I have everybody's attention, please?
I would like to propose a toast to not only a great bowler, but a great human being.
And no offense to you guys.
"Since I was just a lad often,
I've had the very bestest friend.
"He may be big, he may be loud,
"so you'll never lose him in a crowd.
"But for my friend the special part...
"Is what's behind his ribs...
His heart."
"I owe my son to him, and now...
"I stand before my peers and vow...
"I'll pay him back, someday, somehow."
The end.
- That was beautiful, Barn.
- I meant every word of it, Fred.
- Care to join me in a cold one?
- Love to.
It doesn't get any better than this.
Ohh!
No.
Look at him.
Drunk as a skunkosaurus.
Aaaah!
Mother, I can handle this.
What's that old fossil doing here?
Did the tar pits back up again?
Well, somebody has to be here looking after my daughter and grandchild...
While you're out carousing with a bunch of Neanderthals.
Oh, really?
Well, for your information, the lodge no longer accepts Neanderthals.
He robs your nest egg to bail out that little troll next door while my daughter has to wash her clothes in the river.
- I got half a mind...
- Oh, don't flatter yourself.
That's it! Where's my club, Wilma?
You just try it, fatso!
- If you was a man, I'd knock you...
- Enough! Mother! Fred!
You two should be ashamed of yourselves!
I've got my hands full just being ashamed of him.
You got your hands full when you scratch your neck!
Stop it!
Both of you!
Mother, Fred is a loving husband and a good provider.
Oh, really? What has he ever provided you besides shade?
Oh, Wilma.
You could've married
Elliot Firestone, the man who invented the wheel.
Instead you picked Fred Flintstone, the man who invented the excuse.
Let me tell you something, Pearl.
I'm not going to be a nobody all my life.
One of these days, I'm gonna be a somebody, a real somebody!
We'll live in luxury, and Wilma will have everything she deserves.
When that day comes, you'll be so busy eatin' crow you'll be passing feathers for a month!
Oh, you poor, poor dear.
And when I think of all the sacrifices your father made for you.
Lambs, oxen, your brother Jerry.
- Well...
- Oh, Wilma.
Do your mother a favor.
Just call Elliot Firestone.
Even if things don't work out, he can give you a great deal on some tires.
- Yes, Mother.
- Byesie-bye.
I'll show her. I'll show everybody.
I know you will, Fred.
- Call me fatso.
- Let's get some sleep.
Hey, what's the special?
This job sucks.
- What you got today?
- Lizard and onions. Want half?
Sure.
I hear that eatin' too much red meat is bad for you.
What a load of bunk.
My father ate it every day of his life, he lived to the ripe old age of 38.
Your attention please.
May I have your attention!
I have a very important announcement to make.
You found out why the guys in pit six are losing their hair?
Yes!
And we are currently in the process of refuting the results of that investigation.
But today I am here to formally announce the creation of Slate and Company's executive placement program.
Hold your questions, please.
That's right, this Saturday an aptitude test will be given, granting one of you the opportunity to crawl out of the primordial ooze and be somebody.
A vice president at
Slate and Company, with an obscene salary and a shiny nameplate.
Ooh.
Good luck, and may the best biped win.
An executive? This is my chance to be somebody.
Be somebody.
Whee!
Higher, Bamm-Bamm, higher!
Higher! Higher!
Whee!
- Wilma.
- Hmm?
How did you get rid of the ring around the collar?
By washing Fred's neck.
Hmm. You know, if Fred scores the highest on that test, you'll be able to hire someone to do your laundry for you.
If Fred scores the highest on that test,
I'll have to hire someone to revive me.
Oh, it's true,
Fred's no Albert Einstone.
- But you never know, he may surprise you.
- Whee!
Well, maybe.
- He has been studying day and night.
- Whee!
I know! I've never seen him so excited about something you couldn't spread mayonnaise on.
Barn, I've been thinking about this executive job.
It's not me.
Cooped up inside some swank office all day, kissing the big shot's feet.
Not Fred Flintstone.
Why, good afternoon, Mr. Vandercave.
My, that's a handsome pelt you're wearing today.
Thank you.
Your attention, please!
Please take your seats.
And welcome.
You will have one hour to complete the exam.
Please carve all answers with a well-sharpened No. 2 chisel.
On behalf of Slate and Company,
I want to wish you all the very best of luck.
Let's begin.
Eeee!
Ohh.
Chisels down.
Please slide your answer slab into the numbered envelope provided and stack them neatly on my desk.
Psst! Hey, Fred! How'd you do?
How'd I do? How'd I do?
- You want me to take that up for you?
- Yeah. Thanks, pal.
"And I stand before my peers and vow,
"I'll pay him back, someday, somehow."
Well, Cliff, the test results are in.
And our unsuspecting dupe is?
Believe it or not, the one who scored the highest was Fred Flintstone.
- That big ape?
- No, the big ape got a 65.
Flintstone? Oh, this can't be right!
He must have cheated.
He's dense, he's witless...
He's perfect.
The results of the exam were very competitive, and just because an applicant was not selected... ls no indication of lack of ability.
- I am pleased to announce...
- I know a kiss-off when I hear one. Let's go.
That the newest member of our executive rank is Mr. Fred Flintstone!
- Huh?
- Barney, quick. What's my name?
- Fred Flintstone!
- Don't toy with me, Barney.
You did it, Fred! You made it!
Yabba-dabba-dabba-doo!
Good morning, Mr. Vice President.
Good morning, Mrs. Vice President.
Oh, Dino! Oh, Dino, no!
- Hey!
- Mmm!
Atta baby!
Oh...
Good boy, Dino.
Well, how do I look?
Daddy pretty.
It's perfect!
Yeah. Snazzy.
What am I gonna call you now? Boss? Chief?
No, a simple "Your Highness" will do.
No, Barn.
I'm not gonna be one of these guys that makes it then forgets where he came from.
The first thing I'm gonna do is get everyone in the quarry some vacation time.
And maybe a health plan with free foot care.
I'd settle for them little packets of ketchup for the lunch room.
- I'm only one man.
- Not from the back.
Hey, hey.
Well, I guess this is it,
Mr. Flintstone.
Go get 'em, big guy.
- Hey, Barn.
- Yeah, Fred?
Could you spot me a couple bucks for lunch? I'm a little short.
You're right, Fred.
Nothing's changed.
Welcome aboard, Flintstone!
We're glad you're here. Nice suit!
You know, Fred, any gravel brain can shovel rock down in the quarry, but up here...
- Do you know what we do up here?
- Me and the guys have always wondered.
We interface, Flintstone.
We strategize, analyze, conceptualize, prioritize...
When do we eat?
Fred, until this moment I wasn't sure we'd picked the right man.
Now I'm certain.
Fred Flintstone, you've arrived.
- This is my office?
- That's right.
- This is my chair?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not to throw too much at you on your first day, but this big thing here is your desk.
- My desk?
- Watch out for your fingers in the drawers.
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Fred, I'd like you to meet your new secretary,
- Miss Sharon Stone.
- My secretary?
Personal secretary, Mr. Flintstone.
That is, of course, if you want me.
Great.
Well, I'm sure the two of you would like to get...
Better acquainted.
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like you to know that I enjoy working long hours, late nights, even weekends.
So feel free to use me however you see fit.
Now, can I get you anything?
- Coffee?
- Sure.
- How would you like it?
- In a cup?
Bold choice, Mr. Flintstone!
You'll go far in this company.
Take a memo. Cliff, let's play golf.
We can prioritize, conceptualize and, uh... Tenderize.
Executively yours, Fred Fli... Ah!
Are there six or seven
"I"s in "Fli... Ah"?
- Who said that?
- It was I, your dictabird.
- Dicta-what?
- Dictabird. Read my beak.
"Cliff, let's play golf.
"We can prioritize, conceptualize and, uh, tenderize."
Wow. Wow!
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like to warn you that management positions are fraught with peril.
Whenever you find yourself in a befuddled state,
I urge you to avail yourself of my experience and sage advice.
Oh, really?
Listen, birdie, let's get the pecking order straight here.
Hmm.
I don't need any help from you.
I'm Vice President of...
Of, uh...
Industrial procurement.
How about that? Excuse me.
Hey, guys!
Guess what I am!
Vice President of
Industrial Procurement!
Oy! Whew.
Yeah.
There. I'm all done with the requisition forms.
What do you think?
It's perfect.
Looks just like the real one.
Mr. Flintstone, you are about to embezzle a great deal of money.
Unfortunately, for you, we get to keep it.
We can have Flintstone sign these right away.
Not just yet.
Creatures like this
Flintstone are primitive, prone to irrational bouts of integrity.
We've got to make absolutely certain he'll do whatever we say.
Fred is the greatest bowler on Earth.
"Fred is the greatest bowler on Earth."
Now you talk, and see how much I can remember.
Workin' hard?
Okay, Fred, are you ready for your first executive action?
Ready and willing. Whatever you need, consider it done!
Good! I want you to fire Bernard Rubble.
Done... What? Fire Barney? Why?
Well, for starters, he scored the lowest on the management aptitude test.
He's an imbecile. The company can't afford to have dead weight like him on the payroll!
But, Mr. Vandercave, he's got a new kid, a mortgage.
I'm his best friend. I can't.
Fred...
If you don't fire him,
I will.
And then I'll fire you.
Come on, Fred, usually you're yakkin' my ear off, but today you haven't said two words.
Something exciting must have happened up there.
- You don't want to know, Barn, believe me.
- Sure I do, Fred.
You're the first one of us to make it out of that quarry.
Look at me.
I'll probably be working there the rest of my life.
No, you won't, Barn.
Take my word for it.
Come take a look... It's a dish in the shower, you keep the soap in it.
Barney, there's something we gotta talk about.
Yeah, yeah. Later, Fred.
Surprise!
Way to go, Fred!
- Wilma, you shouldn't have.
- Hmm?
I didn't. This was all
Barney and Betty's idea.
Aren't we lucky to have friends like them, Fred?
Ohh!
There he is!
There's my big, handsome son-in-law!
Have you lost weight?
Have we met?
Can I have everybody's attention, please?
I've got something I'd like to say.
I hope it's not another poem.
Fred... Betty, Bamm-Bamm and I could not be happier,
- even if it was me that got that job.
- Aww!
So we got a little something to show how proud of you we are.
Congratulations, big guy!
Barney, I can't accept this.
- Sure, you can.
- No, I can't. Take it back.
- We can't. We had your initials branded on it.
- It's yours, Fred.
- No, it's not!
- Fred, what's wrong with you?
It's a lovely gift.
- He's thrilled to receive it. Aren't you, Fred?
- No!
- Don't you like the color?
- It's not the briefcase, it's not the color.
- I just can't take anything from you.
- But, Fred...
Take a hike, shorty.
My Freddie doesn't want that tacky thing.
- How come, Fred?
- Because you can't afford it, Barn.
Sure I can, pal.
Not anymore.
- You're fired.
- Fired?
Well!
Let's not let a little thing like this spoil the party!
Conga line!
Conga! Conga!
Don't worry about me, Fred.
I've been working in that quarry since it was eight feet deep.
Atta boy!
There could be a whole new world opening up for me.
Maybe I'll take in that franchise show this weekend.
That's the spirit.
There's just one thing I gotta know.
After all these years, how come they're canning me?
Barn, you're a wonderful father, a loving husband, a hard worker, and one heck of a little bowler.
But, Barn, none of that counts on an aptitude test.
You got the lowest score, pal.
The lowest score?
Wilma, that is beautiful!
- Well, I have always wanted...
- You can't catch me!
- A Halstone original.
- Mmm.
- Ohh!
- Now, Wilma, don't be silly!
Your husband's a big executive.
You can afford it.
Charge it!
Bamm-Bamm!
Ohh! Bamm-Bamm!
- No!
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!
Gentlemen, please. I cannot endorse this modernization... if it means laying off all those workers.
Some have been here since the beginning of time.
What if I could quadruple your income?
I'll miss them. You were saying?
Sorry I'm late. I had car trouble.
Picked up a nail.
Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Flagstone.
May we continue?
Mr. Slate. Gentlemen.
I have a vision.
While our competitors are mired in the Stone Age,
I give you... The future!
- Ohh.
- Slate and Company will revolutionize the building industry...
By providing simple, low-cost, modular housing units.
Impossible, you say?
Let me demonstrate.
Through the miracle of geothermal power, the raw material is elevated to the second stage, where our steam-powered conveyor belt carries...
Steam?
He's a madman!
Steam-powered conveyor belts...
Carry the product to be shaped, cleaned, inspected and delivered to discerning consumers worldwide.
And did I mention increasing our profit margin...
- Fourfold?
- Very impressive, Mr. Vandercave.
Very impressive. I think we should implement this system immediately.
Yes?
Excuse me, Mr. Slate.
I know I'm the new man here, but I don't think you hired me to sit around and look pretty.
I hate to bust your bubble, but if you build houses this small, who's gonna live in 'em?
- Excuse me. Mrs. Rubble?
- Yes.
There seems to be a slight problem with your credit carol.
Really? And what would that be?
It's no damn good!
I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
- Go and play, children.
- Wilma, I promise you I'll pay you back.
- I just don't know when.
- Oh, now, Betty.
- It can't be as bad as all that.
- But it is.
Barney's still out of work, we've nearly spent all of our savings.
And, Wilma, what if the adoption agency finds out?
I don't want to lose my baby.
I swear, Betty, Fred and I would never let that happen.
- Oh, Wilma.
- Oh, Betty.
Pterodactyl alert!
Mommy, help!
- Ow, yuck!
- Ew!
And in conclusion, Mr. Slate,
I feel a paid vacation for everyone in the quarry would raise morale and increase productivity, um, um... A whole bunch!
Sincerely yours,
Frederick J. Flintstone.
Shall I make that "Flagstone," so he'll know who it's from?
My, don't we look handsome today?
Thank you.
Here are today's batch of requisitions.
- All marked and ready for your signature.
- Okay.
You know, Miss Stone,
I've been signing stacks of these for weeks, and I hate to pry, but what are they?
Oh, just tiny little forms so that we can pay the contractors working on the modernization.
We remodeled our kitchen a couple of years ago, and let me tell you, contractors can be real pirates.
- I'm gonna read these over.
- No!
You're much too busy for that, Mr. Flintstone.
Besides, reading is my job.
You wouldn't want to put poor little old me out of work, now, would you?
No.
Your wife. Mmm-mmm.
- Your wife.
- My wife. Wilma?
- Wilma! What a surprise!
- So it would seem.
Miss Stone, I'd like you to meet my wife Mrs. Flagstone...
And our daughter, um... Um, um, um...
Isn't she beautiful? My family.
- I've heard so much about you.
- Well, I wish that I could say the same.
That'll be all, Miss Stone.
I'll sign those documents and place them on your desk.
Whatever you want.
- Your secretary is very attractive.
- Really? I hadn't noticed.
Did I mention she chisels
18 words a minute?
Hmm.
Hey, Wilma, did ya ever see one of these?
My wife is the most beautiful gal in Bedrock.
"My wife is the most beautiful gal in Bedrock."
Nice try, Fred.
"Nice try, Fred."
Fred! I've come to talk about the Rubbles' troubles.
Hasn't Barney found a job yet?
It's gotten so bad, they've had to rent out their house just to make ends meet.
Really. Where are they gonna live?
So glad you're over your cold.
Thank you.
Isn't this nice, Betty?
The Flintstones and the
Rubbles, all under one roof.
Yes, but this is such an imposition.
Are you sure it's okay with Fred?
Oh, absolutely.
As a matter of fact, he thinks it was his idea.
- Hey, Freddie, a couple of cool ones.
- Oh, yeah.
How about it, Barn?
- Flintstones and Rubbles under one roof.
- But it's only temporary.
It'd better be.
- It'd better be!
- Yeah!
Ah, Barn, I admire ya.
You've lost your job, your dignity, but not your sense of humor.
Hey, cut it out, Fred!
You like your steak rare?
- Yeah.
- That one's yours.
Hey, hey, stop! Come here, you purple rodent!
Don't forget to wash that off before you eat it!
Come here! Give me that!
Help! Somebody!
Flintstone gets the rock.
He sets his shot. He shoots!
Oh!
Oh! Oh, boy.
Miss Stone, what a pleasant surprise.
Oh. What happened here?
- That's what I'd like to know!
- I'll get someone to fix it.
Oh, Miss Stone?
Before you go, there's something bothering me...
- About this new system we're putting in here.
- Oh?
Yeah. I don't pretend to understand it all, but wouldn't this put a lot of my guys out of work?
How would I know?
I'm just a little ol' secretary.
Are you kiddin' me? You're smart!
I could tell that right off.
There's a lot more to you than you... Er... Uh...
- You... I mean...
- Thank you.
I sure hope I didn't get you into too much trouble with your wife the other day.
Nah. Wilma always forgives me.
She knows I love her.
- And you do, don't you?
- Are you kiddin"?
I'll never forget, the first time I met her she was working at a restaurant.
I won this "All You Can Eat" contest and she was the one that cleaned me off.
Every night I go home and look at her and I think,
"What is a beautiful woman like that doing with a big galoot like me?"
I think I know.
- Where have you been?
- With Fred.
I mean, Mr. Flintstone.
I'm worried, Cliff.
He's smarter than we thought.
He'd have to be to get himself dressed in the morning.
He's been asking a lot of questions.
I think we should just call the whole thing off.
No. No, I've got a better idea.
Why don't we turn ourselves in, then we can rot in jail until the poles freeze over.
I was just thinking...
Stick to your strengths, Miss Stone.
And I'll stick to mine.
Besides, if Mr. Flintstone insists on being so conscientious, perhaps we can give Fred...
Something to take his mind off work, hmm?
- A bonus?
- That's right, Fred!
- You deserve it.
- For what?
Don't be modest, you go-getter, you!
And Fred, let me let you in on a little secret.
If you really want to become a top executive at this company, you've got to start living like one.
Yabba-dabba-doo!
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones
They're the modern
Stone Age family
From the town of Bedrock
They're a page right out of history
- Good afternoon, madam.
- Full serve, please.
Let's ride
With the family down the street
Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time
Oh, dear!
We'll have a gay old time
Good boy.
Good, Wilma! Use your arms.
Perfect. That's four.
Betty! Towel.
Keep going. Go eight.
Strong, tight. Go nine.
A yabba-dabba-doo time
The Flintstones!
We'll have a gay old
Time
Oh!
Yeah!
Who said money doesn't buy happiness?
But, Fred, isn't this all too much too fast?
Wilma, in the buffet of life there are no second helpings.
You gotta fill up your plate, top off your cup, and stuff a few rolls in your pocket.
Fred, stop!
Mmm. Frisky!
You know, Barney, life's funny.
One minute people are your best friends, the next you're fantasizing they're being ripped apart by a pack of rabid wolves.
- You too, huh?
- Oh, Barney, they've changed.
I hardly know them since
Fred's become such a big shot.
And it should be us squanderin' all our money and treatin' our friends like dirt.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothin'.
Just sour grapes, I guess.
Oh, don't worry, Barney.
It's gonna get better.
One day we're gonna look back on all this and we'll laugh.
Jeez, I hope so, Betty,
'cause tomorrow they got me testin' shark repellent.
Mmm. Oh, Barney. Ooh.
Leaving early?
Actually, the wife and I were going to have dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.
Ooh, pricey. Be sure to put that on your expense account.
Fred, before you go...
Would you mind chipping your
"X" on a couple of these?
Yeah, sure. What are they?
Well, you sign these and your buddies down in the quarry get some much-needed time off.
No kiddin'! I guess Mr. Slate finally noticed all those memos I been sendin' in.
I hope the guys will know who's to thank for this.
I'll make sure you get all the credit.
Mr. Flintstone, up to now our relationship has not been based on mutuality of admiration or respect.
Huh?
Put simply, you hate my bird guts and I think you're dumber than mud.
- Ah. Well, good night.
- Still, I wish to pass on an old dictum...
From business school that may be apropos here.
Only an idiot signs something before reading it.
Excuse me. I'm the executive, you're the office equipment.
If I want to ask the office equipment for advice,
I'll ask the water cooler!
Ladies and gentlemen, the B.C.-52's!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Twitch!
Well, I know a place where the hipsters go
Called Bedrock
Twitch, twitch
'Cause they're itching for it down in prehistoric
Bedrock
Twitch, twitch
It's a funky town so
I'll see you down
It's a funky town called Bedrock, yeah
Oh, the Stone Age crowd is twitching proud
In Bedrock
Twitch, twitch
They do the twitch
Twitch, twitch, come on
Twitch, twitch
Twitch, twitch
Twitch, twitch
Twitch, twitch
Do it, come on, baby
Do it, do it, do it
Do the twitch like you got an itch, itch
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Itch, itch, itch, itch
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Twitch!
Thank you, Bedrock!
Thanks, everybody. And remember, don't drink and pedal.
Good night!
How 'bout a spin, Betty?
No, thank you, Fred.
I'll wait till Barney gets here.
He started some new job today.
I'm not sure what time he gets done.
While we're waiting, how about another carafe of the bubbly?
Garcon! Whoops.
Don't worry, Mr. Flintstone.
I'll have that taken care of right away.
Table seven, sonny.
Barney!
Barney, nice skins!
Sit down, take a load off!
- I can't, Fred. I'm working here.
- You're a busboy?
It's honest work.
Yeah, I don't have to fight Dino for my supper.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll get you a fresh tablecloth, sir.
See Wilma, you were worried he'd never find a job and we'd be stuck with him forever.
Ow!
Flintstone! Flintstone!
We want Flintstone!
The demonstration continues to get uglier at Slate and Company
following the unexpected layoff of virtually the entire labor force
by V.P. Fred Flintstone.
For the Cave News Network, this is Susan Rock.
Fred, did you hear what happened to everyone at the quarry today?
Yup. A few hours ago, I sent them all off on a nice, long vacation.
You mean, a permanent vacation.
He fired them!
Fred! How could you?
- I didn't do that.
- You did too! It's all over the TV!
Fred!
Who are you going to believe, me or some busboy?
That busboy is your best friend!
Best friend? I lost my best friend the day I became an executive!
He's just jealous of my hard-earned success.
Hard-earned? Tell me something,
Mr. Vice President, what's a graduated inventory plan, huh?
How about supply and demand?
Hey, Fred! What's two and two?
I didn't come here to talk business.
I'm out with my wife.
Now, get me a clean spoon.
That does it!
The only reason you got that job is
'cause I switched tests with you.
- Oh, Barney.
- Oh-ho-ho, that's rich!
What good would it do me to switch tests with the guy that got the lowest score?
- Think about it, Fred.
- Oh, finally it all makes sense.
You don't believe this, do you?
Are you calling my husband a liar?
This has gone far enough.
After everything that we've done for you. We took you into our home.
Yeah? So you could show off every chance you got!
You used to be such nice people, but now...
You're just a couple of rich snobs!
Better than being a couple of petty ingrates.
Come on, Barney.
We are moving out, tonight!
Hang on, Betty.
I forgot to punch out.
Eh, put it up top.
Betty, please. We can work it out.
We're all civilized people here.
It's too late, Wilma.
Come on, we all said things that we didn't mean.
Speak for yourself.
Come on, Betty. Time to hit the road.
Fred! Aren't you even the least bit sorry?
Sure, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever met the little moocher.
Oh, Betty.
- Good-bye, Wilma.
- Oh.
They're gone.
I cannot believe you just sat there and let them walk out of our lives.
At least I can walk around the house in my underwear again.
That's more important than
20 years of friendship?
It is on a hot day.
They were holding us back, Wilma.
We'll make new friends. There's
4,000 other people in this world!
- Who needs the Rubbles?
- I do.
But I'll tell you what I don't need.
I don't need this necklace.
You know, I don't need this lamp.
And I don't need this television set.
Not the TV!
I don't need this.
I don't need this.
I don't think I'll be needing any of this bone china.
Because I don't have any friends to invite to dinner.
I don't think I'll be using any of these cups or saucers.
You're gonna regret this, Wilma.
It's gonna take you hours to clean up this mess.
All right, Wilma.
Enough of this charade.
Come back now, and I'll forgive ya.
Oh, you're bluff in',
Wilma Slaghoople.
You're not going to your mother's.
Once around the block, you'll realize the folly of your ways and you'll come crawling back.
Please.
It's finally happened,
I've become my father.
Now, Barney, don't talk like that.
- This place is fine for now.
- Come on, Betty.
We're living downwind from a family of wild boars.
- Face it. We've hit rock bottom.
- Hmm.
Come here, little guy.
Can you say da-da? Say da-da.
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.
It doesn't really matter where we live, as long as we're together.
Family hug!
- Betty?
- Hmm?
Exactly where did you get those eggs?
Sorry.
I think it might be twins.
There he is!
You're a traitor, Flintstone!
- Listen to me. I'm your friend.
- You're no friend of ours!
You're a rotten bowler too!
Good morning, Mr. Flint...
They made a fool of me.
Look what they had to work with.
Flintstone, heard you were down in the file room.
Find anything interesting?
Yeah! I'm on to your little scam.
Billing phony companies and keeping the money for yourself.
- I'm going to Mr. Slate.
- Good idea.
Turning yourself in might buy you a little leniency.
- Me? This entire scheme was your idea.
- True.
But I've graciously decided to give you all the credit, since it's your name on the requisitions.
I never touched any of that money!
Hmm. Fred, please.
Remodeling your house, furs, jewelry, a fully-equipped Le Sabertooth.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. You should have been more discreet.
I'm innocent!
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
Miss Stone, call security.
Tell them we've uncovered an embezzler.
Miss Stone, you'll back me up, won't ya?
You better run while you still have a chance.
You'll never get away with this.
I already have.
Here comes the pterodactyl.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- It's no use, Mother.
She misses Fred.
I hope it's not that pesky Avrok lady again.
Oh!
- Betty!
- Oh.
- Bamm-Bamm!
- I have missed you so much.
I don't care what Barney said.
I couldn't let you go through this alone.
- Have you heard from Fred?
- No.
I spoke to a lawyer.
If he's missing seven years, you can remarry.
Mother!
Well, wherever Fred is,
I hope he knows I still love him.
Oh.
Calling all Bedrock units, all Bedrock units.
Tonight, in a special edition of Bedrock's Most Wanted,
we bring you the story that's rocked our city,
"The Case of the
Embezzling Executive."
Mr. Flintstone, what are you doing?
I'm an executive. I'm embezzling.
I'm shocked!
How could you ever marry that man?
Mother! That man is not my husband.
That's right. He plays Dr. Gravelman on The Young And The Thumbless.
Fred might be a lot of things but a thief is not one of them.
- Can he prove it?
- Who cares?
Yabba-dabba-dabba!
This menace remains at large...
We ask the public's help in apprehending...
Maybe I can.
A little something to take that chill off. Take a swig of this.
Put hair on your knuckles.
Tell me something... You one of those guys that was laid off at the stone quarry?
I used to work there.
A lot of guys here would like to get their hands on the guy who's responsible for all this.
- So they could hear his side of the story?
- What? His side of the story?
Huh? Flintstone!
Flintstone!
It is! Flintstone!
Squealer!
Get him!
Just think.
This time tomorrow, we'll be on a pterodactyl winging our...
- Oh, Cliff.
- Hmm?
How come there's only one ticket to Rocapulco?
For your protection, darling. I thought
I would go on a "business trip," while you stay here to keep up appearances.
Then, when we're sure it's safe, I'll send for you.
Forgive me, Cliff.
Looks like you've thought of everything.
Psst. Excuse me!
- Hello.
- No, Mumsie, I don't want to go to school.
The other boys make fun of me.
Wake up!
Oh, Mrs. Flintstone. To what do
I owe the honor of this break-in?
I need your help, Mr. Bird.
You hear everything that goes on in this office.
Hmm-hmm.
You are the only one who can help clear my husband.
What a delicious irony.
Thank you for sharing it with me.
Now, let me share something with you.
Oh, now, Wilma, calm down.
- Maybe I can reason with him.
- Ow!
There. All set.
You know, my only regret is I won't be around when that shoddy new equipment blows up in their big, dumb faces.
Oh, well, I'll just have to console myself with all that money.
Hey, who's that?
That's Flintstone's wife.
What would she want with a stinky old dict...
Son of a brachiosaurus!
Well, Cliff. I guess you haven't thought of everything.
Oh, this is far from over.
String him up!
You can't do this. I was framed!
In a minute you're going to be boxed.
Anybody want a snow cone?
- Barney!
- Fred!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm getting lynched!
Oh. I got cherry, lime, rocky road.
Do you know this guy?
Know him? He used to be my best friend.
In a way, if it wasn't for me, this whole mess probably wouldn't have happened.
Thanks for filling us in. We could've made a very big mistake here.
- Hang both of 'em.
- What?
Gee, take it easy. They make you pay for your own uniforms.
Barney, I thought you came to save me.
Save you? I saw a crowd,
I figured I'd sell a few snow cones.
- You mean you haven't forgiven me yet?
- Nope.
And frankly, I don't think this is going to help.
- I took a cherry.
- I can't break a 20.
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute!
Look, Barn, I know you're still a little mad at me.
But I want you to know, if I had to have someone hanging next to me,
I'm glad it's you.
I guess switchin' them tests didn't turn out much like I planned, huh, Fred?
Hey, got any lemon?
Check in the back.
Gee, why can't business be this good every day?
The story of my life.
- I'm a loser.
- No, you're not.
This makes me a winner?
No, but you're the best friend a guy ever had and that makes you a winner in my book, pal.
Me...
I'm just a big jerk.
Ah, everybody loves you, Fred.
Except for this lynch mob.
Ah, Barn.
Ah, Fred.
You'll have plenty of time to bond in the afterlife.
Wilma, look!
Watch out for that tree!
Now wait, everybody.
Fred is innocent.
Barney, do you have to do everything Fred does?
Everybody, listen to him.
First things first.
I demand an apology.
- I'm sorry!
- Not you, him.
Me? Apologize to a bird?
Not Fred Flintstone!
I had hoped we might be colleagues but instead, you've treated me as if I were an ordinary piece of office furniture.
I may eat bugs, but I have feelings, Mr. Flintstone.
And you've hurt them.
Aww.
Uh, well, look, I know I could've been a little more sensitive.
- Especially when you were molting.
- Oh.
So, I'm... Sorry.
I don't think they heard you in the back.
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Oh.
Now, then, gather 'round, everyone.
I'll tell you the tale of an unsophisticated man caught up in a treacherous web of power, deceit and lust.
Ooh, yeah.
Why is the door open?
- Betty, the door is open!
- Wilma, something's wrong!
- Pebbles!
- Bamm-Bamm!
What kind of madman would do something like this?
That's a poor poochie.
That's a baby.
- Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are gone!
- They left this.
- It's a note.
- If you want to see your kids again, bring the Dictabird to the quarry at dawn. No police.
Mr. Flintstone.
Stealing office equipment, really. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Is this the kind of example you want to set for your daughter?
- Where are the kids?
- The bird, please.
- First, we want our children.
- Of course.
Bamm-Bamm!
Take one more step, Mr. Rubble, and this quarry's safety record will be severely tarnished.
Now, give me the bird.
Go on, Fred. Give him what he wants.
- What?
- Don't worry, I got a plan.
We're gonna get the kids back and then we'll rescue you.
What a strategist.
I should have signed with Disney.
They never would've allowed this sort of thing to happen.
- Ahh! Thank you, gentlemen.
- Easy.
And in the words of my beloved mother,
I'm taking the money and moving to a warmer climate.
Help, Daddy!
Let's discuss this, Cliff.
May I call you Cliff?
Barney, too much pressure.
One, two, three...
Nice goin'.
- Now what do we do?
- You get the kids, I'll try and stop this.
Whoa!
Cliff y, have I ever told you you have a very distinguished chin?
Shut up! Ahh!
Whoa!
Yo, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Oh, dear, Oh, dear.
Too many years behind a desk. Mayday, mayday!
Hi, da-da.
You did it! You called me da-da!
Oh, Barney, you lunkhead!
What am I going to do?
I gotta think of somethin'.
Not now.
Wake up, Uncle Barney!
Help, help!
Save me! Save me from this mad M.B.A.!
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- My hero.
Yipes.
Flintstone, kiss your bird good-bye.
Oh, mama.
Will there be anything else, Mr. Flintstone?
No, Miss Stone.
Take the rest of the day off.
Yabba-dabba-doo!
Cliff?
It's time for you and me to interface.
- Aah!
- Stee-rike!
And then, Cliff said,
"True. But I've graciously decided to give you all the credit,
"since it's your name on all the requisition forms."
Mr. Flintstone, I may not be in on Monday.
Don't worry, Miss Stone.
I'll tell 'em what you did.
- They'll let you off easy.
- I've been a very bad girl.
But you have to admit,
I was very, very good at it.
Come on, do it for Mommy. Who am I?
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.
Thank goodness, you're all right.
Well, I'm not going to jail, but it won't be easy getting a new job.
What kind of reference is
Mr. Slate gonna give me after I destroyed his quarry?
None of this was your fault.
Mr. Slate will understand.
Flintstone!
Sure, now he gets my name right.
How did this happen?
Mr. Slate, it all started when the
Rubbles here wanted to adopt a baby.
Not that!
How did this happen to Cliff?
Well, you see, Mr. Slate, the machinery went haywire and the rocks got all crushed up and that got mixed in with water and that came all down the hill.
- Mr. Slate, I'm sorry!
- Sorry?
I love this stuff!
I'm gonna name it after my daughter Concretia.
Flintstone, you're a genius!
Me? Really? Why?
Don't you see? Thanks to concrete, man can now shape his own destiny.
- The Stone Age is over!
- Ahh.
First thing, I want you to hire back all the men, Flintstone.
- We're going into production immediately.
- We?
That's right.
You are hereby promoted to President of the entire concrete division.
Yabba...
That's a real nice offer, Mr. Slate, but unfortunately, I'm gonna have to turn you down.
Don't listen to him, Mr. Slate.
Fred, it's a great job!
This time, you deserve it.
Barney, all my life I wanted to be a somebody.
And when I finally did, I turned into somebody I didn't like.
Good grief, man, have you lost your mind?
This could make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.
I was always the richest man in the world.
I just never knew it.
So, if it's okay with you, Mr. Slate, all I want is my old job back and my old life.
Fred.
And two weeks paid vacation for all the men in the quarry, an annual cost of livin' increase and those little packets of ketchup in the lunchroom.
Done!
Thanks, boss. See you at the company picnic.
There goes the best executive I ever had.
- Fred, I'm so proud of you.
- And I'm proud of you, Barney.
- I'm starving!
- Me too!
What do you say we get some breakfast.
Snake and eggs for everybody.
- My treat.
- Great.
Barney...
- Yeah, Fred?
- Spot me a couple bucks? I'm a little short.
- Not this time!
- What?

Bust a verse said what you think

Sounds stuck in the Stone Age
You're still using a hammer and chisel
Carving out your lyrics on stone pages

Set it off and he said yabba-dabba-doo
Then he got to prove

- Shh.
- Ask him.
- Shh!
Look at him, grandpa.
Ask him!
Ryan, that's enough.
Uh, I'm sorry.
He, uh...he thinks you're Santa Claus.
I am.
Merry christmas.
Uh, merry--Merry christmas.
Nuts.
I should have got his autograph.
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
In a sleighing song tonight oh, jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh hey, jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
What is the problem?
Your Santa Claus is wearing a topcoat and a fedora.
Ya-ha! Ha ha ha ha!
That's not my Santa Claus.
Right. Now...throw it out...
Bring it up right up high, and down she comes!
It's just in the wrist, you see.
It's really quite simple, you know, when you get the knack.
Now then, why don't you-- o.k., pops, come on. It's my turn.
Give me the whip.
What have you been drinking?
Just something to keep me warm.
You are intoxicated, sir.
And you're a pain in the butt.
You are a disgrace.
You have any idea how many children are watching you?
Give me back the whip.
Let me tell you something-- when you put on this suit, you represent something that has great significance to millions of people all over the world.
Now, I could overlook your poorly-manufactured jacket or even your ludicrously unbelievable beard.
Hey!
Or perhaps your phonily-padded tummy, but I will not tolerate public drunkenness.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Can I get a cop over here?
That's a very good idea. Officer!
Hey, wait a minute, you.
Mrs. Walker! Mrs. Walker!
Mrs. Walker, we need your help here!
Your sense of occasion is something--
If you're not with the parade, get back on the sidewalk.
I need to see whomever's in charge to alert them to this man.
Kiss my--
Oh, easy! Take it easy!
Gramps, come on, hey.
Let's go for a little walk.
That man's a degenerate.
It's time to go right up in the old office.
Ha ha!
Little drafty there.
Hey, let's just watch the parade, o.k.?
Come on.
O.k. Settle in here.
Oh!
Oh, my god.
Get this costume fixed.
O.k. We'll show this guy how to do it.
Whoa!
Aah!
Oh.
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
Merry christmas to all, and to all a good night.
Sir! Excuse me.
- Hello. I-I'm Dorey walker.
- Oh.
Director of special projects for c.f. Cole's department store.
My pleasure. As a matter of fact,
I was looking for you.
There's no doubt you saw your Santa Claus is inebriated.
I know. He has created such a terrible problem.
Millions of children are watching here and on television.
They're expecting to see Santa Claus, and now we don't have one.
That is a terrible problem.
Would you do it?
Would you be our Santa Claus?
Uh, me?
Well, do you have any experience?
Well...just a little.
Great. I'm sure you'll be fine.
Isn't there someone else that you could ask?
Sir, the parade has started already.
It's you right now, or else
There's no Santa in the cole's thanksgiving day parade.
Might I perhaps have a moment to think about it?
Don't worry about a thing. Just... be yourself.
Now, dasher!
Now, dancer!
Now, prancer and vixen!
Now, comet! Now, cupid!
Now, donner and blitzen!
Hey!
Merry christmas.
Merry chris--
This Santa Claus is fantastic.
Did he sign a contract?
There wasn't any time.
Myrna's going to have him sign after the parade.
She'll have him fill out his employment papers, and he'll start in the morning.
He insisted upon wearing his own Santa suit.
He has his own Santa suit?
Apparently.
Well, if it's horrible, we'll make him wear one of ours.
I'm going home.
You're not going to watch the parade?
No. I think I've had quite enough for one day, thank you.
I will see you in the morning.
O.k. Chin-chin.
Merry christmas.
Susan?
We can see the parade from his window, so put on something comfortable
And come on over.
P.S., Mr. Bedford put the turkey in the oven.
He said you forgot to sew up the turkey's bottom.
The stuffing will all fall out, but he told me not to say anything
Because he loves you, and he wants to kiss you, and he thinks you're
The most beautiful woman in the whole world!
Do you know how much it costs to make this parade?
Uh, a million dollars. $2 million?
1.6. It's probably a big mistake.
Some guy's going to buy cole's and turn it into a junk store.
That's not going to happen.
Two banks just came in and rescued cole's.
You better check your sources.
But cole's has to pay them back plus interest.
If they don't sell a lot at christmas, you can forget about it, pal.
Well, I think you should ask Santa Claus to give cole's an interest-free loan For christmas.
What do you think about that?
That's a good one
Well, you know what?
It might happen.
Santa Claus, he does some pretty amazing things.
Bryan, you know what? I know.
You know what?
The secret.
What secret?
Santa Claus.
I've known for a long time.
He's not real.
Says who?
My mom.
Hi.
I believe you have something of mine.
About 4-foot tall, brown hair, talks like she's 64 years old?
Hey.
Hi. / Hi.
So, what do you think?
It's a good one.
Yeah? Did Santa Claus come by yet?
Nope. Is it Tony falacchi again?
No. Tony had to leave.
Bombed?
Yes.
It's the pressure.
But I got this new guy, and he really looks like the real thing.
Maybe he is.
Are you still coming to dinner?
Am I still invited?
Yes.
Then I'm coming.
Honey, run home and put the camera stuff away.
I'll put the stuff away. You keep watching.
Let her finish watching the parade. Come on.
Santa hasn't even come by yet.
Well, as soon as Santa does come by,
I would like for you to come home.
Sure.
That's the end of the parade, anyway.
There's nothing else to see except guys cleaning up horse poop,
And that doesn't thrill me at all.
Hello!
Merry christmas!
- Hello?
- Jack?
Yes, sir.
I've been watching the parade.
It looks bigger than last year.
What is the crowd estimate?
Well, sir, cops say over a million.
Last year was about 750.
Have marketing come up with a giveaway, something free.
I don't want a crowd outside cole's in the morning.
I hate to say this, Mr. Lamberg.
Cole's has got one hell of a
Santa Claus this year.
If I didn'tknow better,
I'd say he was the real article.
Keep an eye on this, Mr. Duff.
These small, seemingly insignificant, sentimental anachronisms can be surprisingly potent.
I don't want my plans damaged by an elderly cherub in a red suit.
I'm on it, sir.
Bye-bye.
There we go.
- Ooh. Ooh. Ahh. Ahh.
- Happy thanksgiving.
- Happy thanksgiving.
- Happy thanksgiving
You know, this is kind of like TV, except I need a brother and a dog,
And Bryan would be the dad--
Mr. Bedford.
He said to call him Bryan.
Only if it's o.k. with your mom.
It's fine.
Bryan would be the dad, you'd be the mom.
We'd need either a fat person who's our cook or a neighbor who's
Always at our house.
You know, that's not very interesting.
Let's talk about something else.
For the chef.
Oh, in the loosest sense of the word.
In every sense of the word.
The vegetables are catered.
So is dessert.
Thank you, Susan.
You're welcome.
Do we give blessings in this house?
Not unless my grandparents are here.
Would you mind if I did it?
It's a tradition with me.
No. That's fine.
We give thanks for thfood before us and the closeness
Of the people we love, and we pray that these gifts
We so gratefully receive will be shared with those less fortunate than ourselves.
Amen.
Amen.
All right. Let's eat.
I slaved all day.
You really outdid yourself.
One of my elves is married to a fellow called Daniel.
Do you know what you want for christmas?
I want  a peter pollywog patrol frog that swims and blows up.
Gosh, that sounds great
Can mother have a word with Santa, please?
Yes, of course. Just a minute.
Don't make me look bad.
Them things cost 70 bucks.
He just looked at them.
I tell you what.
Shopper's express have got them on sale at 34.Lamberg with a $5.00 rebate.
Now that's reasonable enough, isn't it?
Yeah. Thanks.
But let me ask you a question.
Since when is cole's sending customers someplace else?
I don't think it matters where the toys are sold as long as it makes the children happy.
I'm sure the people here believe the same.
Yeah. Yeah, that's the spirit.
Thanks, Santa. Thank you.
- Merry christmas.
- Merry christmas.
Now then, young man, if you're a very good boy
And do exactly what your mummy tells you, you're going to have a peter pollywog for christmas.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Bye, Santa.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Daniel.
Merry christmas.
Come on, then. Come on.
You the boss?
I'm general manager of the store.
My kid asked Santa for a barf gun.
The Santa said he'd get it for him.
They're by the elevator.
And they're 90 bucks without batteries or barf.
Prices do go up.
Apparently not at bargain village.
They throw in the batteries.
I find it hard to believe cole's could be undersold by that much.
Where did you get your information?
From your Santa Claus.
But if you go out of here, turn to the right...
Excuse me?
Santa's telling everybody where to shop.
If you don't got it, it's too expensive, he's saying where to get it at the right price.
- You're serious?
- Absolutely.
Madam, will you excuse me for a moment?
Tell Santa he made me a cole's shopper.
I'm coming here for everything but toilet paper.
Any store that puts the parent ahead of the buck at christmas deserves my business.
Tell Mr. Cole his Santa Claus ought to get a raise.
You want me to go with you to the chairman and pitch an idea
That you got from Santa Claus?
If cole's doesn't have what you're looking for, we'll find it for you,
Even if it means sending you somewhere else. how does that sound?
It sounds like a great way to go out of business.
Know that house in the country where we do the catalog shoot?
You wanted to buy it.
Yes.
If this works, we're probably looking at a bonus.
And if he hates the idea?
We're no worse off.
If we don't turn this store around, we're all out--
From the chairman to the janitor.
Let's do it.
I...like it.
It's bold. It's fresh.
It will drive victor lamberg nuts.
It's beginning to look a lot like christmas soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
Why?
Why didn't you think of this?
Now if this campaign is successful--
I know in my gut it will be--
Cole's will make lots of money.
The more money they make, the harder it will be for me to buy them out.
Now I want  something done about this.
O.k., go ahead.
This seems like a pretty pointless exercise, Bryan.
I thought as long as we were here, might as well say hello to the old guy.
Why?
Let's just say for the sake of argument that there is a Santa Claus
And that you don't believe in him.
Is it worth the risk that you might not get anything for christmas?
Well, I didn't believe in him last year.
I still got everything i asked my mother for.
Yeah. You get a free candy cane?
I'm trying to limit my intake of sugar.
She can go see Santa now.
O.k., come on. Go ahead.
Nice to meet you.
Hello, sir.
Oh, how do you do?
Would you like to come sit on my knee?
Good. Up you come.
Now then, what's your name?
Susan elizabeth walker. What's yours?
Mine?
Ha ha ha ha.
Well, I have lots of names.
Uh, Kriss kringle,
Santa Claus, father christmas, saint nicholas.
If you were in holland, I'd be sinterklaas, or in italy, le befana.
I have to speak many languages because, of course, I travel a great deal.
That's russian.
That's swahili.
My mother's Mrs. Walker.
She's director of special events for cole's.
Uh-huh.
She runs the parade.
I know how this all works.
You're an employee of cole's.
That is true.
But you're a very good Santa Claus.
Your beard's stuck on real tight.
Usually the store Santa Claus whiskers are too loose.
Yours look realistic.
That's because they are real.
You give them a tug.
Whoo! Ha ha ha.
Are you convinced?
Mm-hmm.
Good.
This isn't the regular Santa suit, is it?
Oh, no. This is the real Santa suit.
It's very nice.
I agree. Lovely.
Gold buttons, gold thread.
It's as real as me.
Well, you ask your daddy if I'm real.
I don't know where he is.
Well, he's--
That's my friend Mr. Bedford.
I don't have a dad anymore.
Ha. Well, now, what can I get you for christmas?
Nothing, thank you.
Nothing?
My mother buys my gifts if I don't  want something too stupid or dangerous or...
Hi, mom.
Hi. It's nice to see you.
Susan, you've taken enough of this man's time.
There's a long line of customers, and they do come first.
Nice to meet you, Susan.
Nice to meet you, too.
Bye-bye.
Nonbelievers.
Right.
If I felt that it was important for her to see Santa Claus,
I would be happy to take her.
I didn'tsee any harm in her saying hello to an interesting old man.
Well, there is harm.
I tell her that there is no Santa Claus, so you bring her down here,
And she sees thousands of gullible kids, and she meets an actor  a very good actor, mind you? with a real beard and a beautiful Santa suit,
Sitting smack dab in the center of a child's fantasy world.
So, who does she believe, the myth or... the mom?
Listen, I just got some mistletoe.
Why don't we go back to my place and try it out?
No.
I don't  think so.
O.k. I'm here. I can help.
All you have to do is ask.
Well, actually, there is one thing.
Would you mind taking Susan home?
Sure.
I'm working at cole's.
All I have to do is to be myself.
There you are. Ha ha.
That's it.
Very good. Very good.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Good evening.
Good evening.
My name is jack duff.
How do you do?
And this is alberta leonard.
How do you do?
Pleasure.
Nice to meet you both. I'm Kriss kringle.
Well, Mr. Kringle, we're with shopper's express, the department store.
Yes. You've got the peter pollywog on sale.
Right.
Yes, we do.
We want you to be our main Santa Claus.
We have over 7,000 stores worldwide, but you would be the number one guy.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the people at cole's have already hired me.
In fact, I've signed a contract.
If you'll excuse me, it's getting a bit late.
Give you a ride?
I can walk. It's probably out of your way.
Where are you going?
4th street, the mount carmel senior center.
We're going right by it.
It's on our way.
Thank you so much.
Um, bye-bye, prancer.
Bye-bye, dancer.
So tell me, Santa.
How does one guy get to every house around the world in one night?
Ah, yes. Well, now that is a vexing question, isn't it?
You see, if you could slow time down so that a second became a year,
A minute became a century, and an hour became a millennium,
Well, you could manage it quite easily, couldn't you?
I remember before--Well,
100 years ago, before the population explosion,
I could manage
To deliver all my goods and have enough time left over for a late supper, A nap, and a round of golf with the easter bunny.
He winters in new zealand, you know.
Thank you so much.
Thank you both very much indeed.
Merry christmas to you, miss leonard.
Merry, merry christmas to you, Mr. Duff.
Same to you, Santa.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
He's completely out of his mind.
Imagine--cole's hiring a guy as nutty as that.
Could become a problem for them.
I know what you mean.
The easter bunny.
Nice to meet you.
Bye-bye now.
You don't think he's nuts, do you?
Hmm?
Well, he believes he's Santa Claus, absolutely believes it.
Maybe that's why he's good at it.
What difference does it make?
Look at our stocks.
They're through the roof.
Sales are up 70% over last holiday.
In a week, this company has turned around.
We could go the other way just as fast if this guy does anything wrong.
What's he going to do?
We don't know.
If the fate of the company rests on one very unstable old man,
You're celebrating our return just a little too soon.
I'm not worried.
Hello, little one. How are you? Come.
Uh, she's deaf.
You don't have to talk to her.
She just wanted to see you.
Thank you.
You are a very... Beautiful young lady.
Ha ha ha ha.
What's your name?
Sami?
That's a beautiful name.
Ha ha ha ha.
Now I tell you what.
Do you know Jingle bells?
Yes. jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way oh, what fun it is to ride on a one-horse open sleigh
Ha ha. Oh, very good.
Darling, what would you like for christmas?
A doll and a bear?
Well, you shall have them.
Sami, I wish you a merry... Christmas.
&nbsp;
Thank you. Thank you.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Something's driving me crazy, and I can't sleep.
What's on your mind?
Santa Claus.
Mr. Kringle? Why, what about him?
He talked sign language with a kid today.
Well, that was considerate of him.
It's weird how he knows so much about toys and kids.
He speaks russian and swahili.
Well, he must be quite a learned man.
He looks exactly like every picture of Santa Claus I ever saw.
Yes, I know. That's why I chose him.
You're positive he's not the real Santa Claus?
I thought that we talked about this.
You understand what he is.
What if we're wrong?
That would be extremely rude.
Well, we're not ong sweetheart.
But all my friends believe in Santa Claus.
Well, most children your age do.
How come I don't ?
Because you know the truth, and truth is one of the most important things in the world.
To know the truth and to always be truthful with others and, more importantly, with yourself.
Believing in myths and fantasies just makes you unhappy.
Did you believe in Santa Claus when you were my age?
Yes.
Were you unhappy?
Well, when all the things that I believed in turned out not to be true, yes, I was unhappy.
Would it be o.k. If I thought about this more?
Do I have to not believe in Santa Claus right away?
Come here.
You have the right to believe whatever you want to believe.
Now, I've told you the truth, but if I'm wrong, I will be glad to admit it.
I'll tell you what. You ask Mr. Kringle for something that you would never ask me for,
And if on christmas morning you don't get it, you will know Once and for all the honest truth about Santa Claus.
That's a very clever idea.
Thank you.
Think you can get some sleep?
- Yep.
- Yeah? Give me a kiss.
Good night.
I love you.
I love you.
- Good night.
- Good night. christmas christmas well, it's christmas time, pretty baby and the snow is
Fallin' on the ground christmas christmas well, it's christmas time, pretty baby...
Barkeep! Reload on this.
Hey. Hey!
Can I get another beer?
Boy, that cole's, they dealt me the high, hard one.
I did a good job for them last year.
This year they give me the--the royal fist.
They didn't have grounds on which to dismiss you.
That broad that runs the parade every year--
One of these college kids with a 3 ounce brain and 50 tons of attitude--
She hires some wacko right off the street to take my place.
Some wacko?
Tell me about him.
He's a loon.
We got thousands in this city.
I'll say.
Never had one of them take my job, though.
Tony, did you have any contact with this old guy?
The guy come up on the float, right in my face.
He got aggressive with you.
He tried to whack me over the head with his cane.
He tried to whack you with a cane?
Isn't that what I just said?
Tony, this'll make you feel better.
Got a little job I want  you to do for me.
What, uh, what kind of job you have in mind?
You'll see.
Just be yourself.
Don't even think about the camera.
You'll be just fine.
Right.
I must confess, I don't know why they're making such a fuss about me.
This is the holiday season, and you're Santa Claus, right?
To many, but to others I'm an old man with a white beard.
But you're still the symbol of the season.
You think I'm a fraud, don't you?
Fraud is a bit too strong a word.
But you don't believe in me.
I believe that christmas is for children.
Your daughter doesn't believe in me, either.
I don't think that there's any harm in not believing in a figure that many do acknowledge to be a fiction.
Oh, but there is.
I'm not just a whimsical figure who wears a charming suit
And affects a jolly demeanor.
You know, I..I...I'm a symbol.
I'm a symbol Of the human ability to be able to suppress the selfish And hateful tendencies that rule the major part of our lives.
If...you can't believe, if you can't accept anything on faith,
Then you're doomed for a life dominated by doubt.
I like you very much, Mrs...
Mrs. Walker, you're a fine woman.
And, you know,
I think you'll make an excellent test case for me, you and your daughter.
If I could make you believe, then there'd be some hope for me.
If I can't... Well, I'm finished.
Shall we go?
I'm Kriss kringle, and I'm at cole's department store in new york city.
Good morning, america.
No. Mr. Kringle's time is extremely limited.
Sorry. Mr. Bedford's on line three.
No. He can't do private sessions.
Can you hold for just a moment? Hang on.
Hi. Bryan, I have the mayor's office on hold.
What's up?
If I can arrange a really, really good
Babysitter for tonight, you want to do some shopping and have dinner?
Well, I'm not sure when I...
I don't know if I can get celia tonight.
I'll take care of it. See you at 7:00?
Well, I-I-I'm not sure what--o.k.
Fine. 7:00. Bye.
Whoa! Who is this one?
This is dancer.
He's a bit slow, do you see?
Poor old dancer.
Oh. Good evening, Mrs. Walker.
Good evening...Mr. Kringle.
Nobody at school is going to believe this one, huh?
Well, if you have to have a babysitter, who's better qualified?
Yes.
Pretty, isn't it?
There really has to be something you want for christmas.
I'm very good at keeping secrets, you know.
Come on. Tell me.
What's this?
Gosh.
That's what I want  for christmas-- a house, a brother, and a dad.
That's all I ever want.
If you're really Santa Claus, you can get it for me.
If you can't, you're just a nice man with a white beard like my mother says.
Oh, Susan.
Just because every child doesn't get his or her wish doesn't mean
There's not a Santa Claus.
I thought you might say that.
Did you?
Yes. Well...
A house is a very big order--
And very expensive.
And a baby, well a baby takes almost a year to, uh, to, uh... nine months. More if the lady's late.
Less if the baby's a preemie.
Right. And a father. I mean, uh...
No one can give anybody a father.
If Santa Claus really can make reindeer fly and go up and down people's chimneys and make millions of toys and go around the world in one night, he could get somebody a house and a brother...and a dad. Right?
Right. Right. Yes. I suppose he... he could.
I don't think I'll ever get those things, so it's no big deal.
Oh. Well, um, perhaps
I could keep this paper. Could I?
Sure.
Well, good night, little angel.
Good night.
Good night, Susan.
Good night, Mr. Kringle.
A family for christmas.
I don't think so.
No, really. I mean... see, that wasn't so bad, huh?
I had a great time.
You need to get out.
You need to forget work...
- I should've listened to you earlier.
- Come out with me.
You understand why I didn't.
Sometimes I think I do .
Sometimes I think I don't .
Well, you are a very patient man.
Most guys are gone after a few months of me.
So you admit that you're rough on men.
No, not just rough on men.
Yeah. I admit it. I'm careful.
At this point in my life, I really don't need to be disappointed.
Do you want one of your christmas presents early?
I got you a christmas present, and I want to give it to you.
What is it?
Do you want it early?
Yes.
What is it?
Open it.
It's an engagement ring.
If I've given you a... false impression of this relationship,
I'm very sorry.
Are you serious?
Have I ever given you any sign that I wanted to marry you?
No.
Then, tell me, whatever possessed you to make a presumption?
You know, I've done everything
I could to try to make you happy.
I love your daughter like she's my own.
I loved you, getting nothing in return.
Never asking for anything in return.
I put my faith in you.
Well, if that's true, then you're a fool.
- Taxi, please
- Certainly.
Mr. Bedford.
Kriss.
How was your night as a babysitter?
Oh. Very pleasant.
Susan's a good kid.
Yes. Delightful. Delightful.
Well, how was it?
I gave her an engagement ring.
Ohh. Ooh!
She didn't like it very much.
Well, perhaps your timing wasn't particularly good.
Oh. Not at all.
She...she's a sad sort of person, isn't she?
It's a pity, really.
She's very kind... but she's terribly careful about her emotions.
What I know about Dorey is pieced together from fragments of a dozen conversations.
She was married in college, he had a drinking problem,
And right after Susan was born he took off and hasn't been heard of since.
She's filled with these, these bitter thoughts.
The worst part is she's dragging
Susan into this with her.
Ah, yes. Well, Susan is struggling with it.
But I get the feeling that she does want to believe in me, you know.
She's a good girl.
She's loyal to her mother's wishes.
I can't fault that.
Of course, if I can't convince the mother,
I have no hope of convincing the child.
The tooth fairy told me that.
Well, your cab's here, Kriss.
I always wondered what guys who have to return engagement rings
Say to the sales clerk at the jewelry store.
Now I don't want to know.
I'm sure in your line of work you can find some lucky guy to give this to.
That's very generous of you, but I don't think this ring will ever fit anyone
Other than Mrs. Walker.
I'm sure you'll find somebody.
- I'm sorry.
- It's o.k.
I'll get over it.
Will Susan?
Well... I know what you want for christmas now.
I'll see what I can do.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye!
Come on.
It's your turn to go up now.
Hello.
What do you want for christmas?
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please step aside?
This is for the children.
Hot little helper you got here, huh, Santa?
She the one that puts the, uh... twinkle in your eye?
Hey, kids, you see that guy up there?
He's not really Santa Claus.
He doesn't even live at the north pole.
He lives in a nursing home on Kriss4th street!
You know what he is?
He's a big... Fat...Fake!
Just a fake.
Ho ho ho.
Hey! Goofball!
Huh?
Yeah, you, numb-nuts.
What is a guy your age playing this game for, huh?
I mean, are you just a lonely, pathetic mental case?
Or does it go a little bit deeper than that?
Is there a darker side to this?
Tell me something, you sorry old cripple, you.
You got a thing for the little ones, huh?
Huh? Huh?
'Cause they ain't much good for nothin' else, are they? Huh?
Stop that man! Quickly!
Get the cane away from him.
Come on.
I...I--I didn'tintend to injure him.
He baited me. He provoked me.
Save it for the cops, sir.
He's badly hurt.
Wait a second. You're-- you're cole's Santa Claus.
Cole's Santa Claus?
Oh...He...said the most...terrible th--Oh...
- Get away folks, please.
- Come with us.
All right, folks.
- Please. Step back.
- Take it easy, mister.
You might want to clear the kids out of the room before we read this next story.
It appears that new york's most famous
Santa Claus has a mean streak.
The centerpiece of c.f. Cole's big holiday ad push is behind bars this morning--
...plans regarding a replacement for
Mr. Kringle.
The spokesperson did say, however, that for at least the remainder Of today, there will be no Santa Claus at the 34th street store.
...without any apparent provocation, struck him repeatedly with a walking stick.
Police arrived within moments and arrested kringle--
If you're planning to take your children to the store today, take note.
There will be no Santa Claus at the 34th street store.
C.f. Cole's competitors are having the last laugh this morning.
Who wears a charming suit and affects a jolly demeanor, you know.
I'm a symbol.
I'm a symbol of the human ability to suppress the selfish and hateful tendencies that rule the major part of our lives.
And if you can't accept anything on faith, then you're doomed to a life dominated by doubt.
Get me Bryan bedford on the phone.
Bryan?
I know. I saw the papers.
I want you to help him.
He's at bellevue, and I don't know what's happening, but he's alone,
And he shouldn't be.
What's cole's position?
Do their attorneys have an opinion?
Oh, this isn't about cole's.
This is about a man who's had something very wrong done to him.
Somebody you care about.
Somebody... you believe in.
Your honor... do you have a moment for ed collins?
Send him in.
Thanks, colby.
How are you, eddie?
What can I do for you?
How are you?
Oh, just the commitment papers for the cole Santa.
That's a shocker, huh?
The press is having a field day.
"age unknown." Old man, is he?
Very old, your honor.
Do I have to read all this?
No. It's a slam dunk.
Guy's out of his mind.
We'd like it over quick.
- "we"?
- Victor.
- "victor"?
- Lamberg.
Oh, yes.
Right there.
Well. Justice will have to prevail, of course.
Oh, of course.
Yes, justice will have to prevail... as always.
Money makes the world go around, eddie.
Yes, it does, your honor, it sure does.
By the way, Mr. Lamberg wanted you to know that he's Very well aware of your re-election campaign coming up this spring.
Tell him I would welcome his support.
Will do.
Come in.
A Mr. Bedford's here to see you.
Who?
He represents Mr. Kringle?
Send him in.
Your honor, there seems to be some undue haste in this case.
I wish to protect my client's rights, as I'm sure you do.
Mr. Prosecutor, this is...
Bryan bedford.
Ed collins.
If your honor please, i request a formal hearing where i may bring witnesses.
Sign the commitment papers now if you like, but I'll bring in habeas corpus this afternoon.
We'll have a hearing.
Thursday morning, 9 a.m.?
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Collins.
Mr. Bedford.
I thought you said the old man didn't have an attorney.
What's the difference?
It'll be a hearing, not a jury trial.
You're the only one that has to be convinced.
Have a good day, judge.
Want to know somethin', mister?
I don't believe it.
This guy ain't dangerous.
He may be off his rails a little bit, but he ain't no thug.
And if he wants to call himself santy Claus... then god bless him.
Hello, Kriss.
Hello, Mr. Bedford.
What brings you out on a miserable day like this?
A friend in need.
Hmm.
You failed your mental exam on purpose, didn't you?
Huh. Why would I... do a thing like that?
I don't know.
Maybe you've served people long enough.
Maybe you've given all you have to give.
No.
Then why did you do it?
The charges against you were dropped.
The man you hit suffered no injury.
You could've been out of here if you passed your exam.
I disgraced myself.
I read your transcript, Kriss.
You defended your honor.
You stood up for the dignity of every child.
That isn't a disgrace.
That's decency.
If I'm dismissed as a crazy old man... then the good name of...
Santa Claus is spared.
That isn't true.
If not for you, there is no Santa Claus.
You are him.
Crazy or not, here or gone, you're Santa Claus.
Only if the children believe that.
And what kind of Santa Claus were they believing in, anyway?
They can't look to me anymore, not after knowing what happened the other night.
Well, think about the other night.
A man was there to photograph the incident.
The man you hit was the man you replaced.
The cops told me this, Kriss.
The cops believe in you.
A lot of people do.
More will when we're finished.
Finished with what?
There's a hearing Thursday to decide if you're to be committed.
I'm going to defend you.
We'll prove that there is Santa Claus and that you're him.
I'm ready, counselor.
Now, we have a few days to distance ourselves from this...scandal
And restart our advertising.
Uh, Mrs. Walker, we are in conference.
I have just read your press release.
You are all such a bunch of cowards.
You really don't deserve to run the store.
You are entirely out of line, Mrs. Walker.
We have spent millions telling people that we are the store that cares.
Well, what is it that we care about?
Profits? Ourselves?
Our jobs?
Well, what about one of our own who needs us now?
And what--what am I to do?
The public perception of Kriss is that he's out of his mind.
He's dangerous.
We have to change that.
If...we stand with Kriss...
If we challenge the rumors and the scandal sheets, if we force the truth, we'll win.
Now, he's going into court with... the best attorney in the city.
And he's going to prove that Kriss is not...crazy.
For the sake of the whole company...
I think that all of you should decide about whether or not You... believe in Santa Claus.
Bring up two. Go.
For the last 75 years, cole's has invited Santa Claus to meet and greet
The children of new york city in our 34th street store.
Cole's believes in Santa Claus... and we will stand by him.
He has done nothing but serve the children and the families of new york city..
And the world. We invite you to join with us and ask yourself this one simple question--
Do you believe in Santa Claus?
I have to confess, I'm a bit uneasy.
You'll be fine.
All you have to do is tell the truth.
Who's that character in the gray suit?
That's the prosecutor.
Oh. Anything I should know about him?
Yeah. He doesn't believe in
Santa Claus.
All rise!
Oyez, oyez.
Let all those who have business before this court come forward.
The honorable justice harper presiding.
Draw near, and ye shall be heard.
You may sit.
Your honor, in the matter of Kriss kringle, the commitment papers are on your desk.
May I call the first witness?
Mr. Kringle, would you please take the stand?
Good morning, judge.
How's that grandson of yours?
The parade.
He thought I looked like Santa Claus.
Oh. Oh, yes.
You swear to tell the whole truth, so help you god?
Yes. Uh, don't i put my hand on a bible?
No, sir, you don't.
Oh. Well, then,
I'll put my hand over my heart instead.
I do . I do .
Sit down, please.
What is your name?
I'm so sorry.
I didn'tintroduce myself.
I do beg your pardon.
You're Mr. Collins.
I'm Mr. Kringle. Kriss kringle.
Order.
Kriss kringle.
It's double "k."
Tell me, Mr. Kringle, do you believe that you are Santa Claus?
Well, would I be here if I didn't?
Just yes or no, Mr. Kringle.
Do you believe that you are Santa Claus?
Yes, of course.
Santa Claus. Hmm.
State rests, your honor.
Mr. Bedford, do you wish to cross-examine the witness?
No further questions, your honor.
Uh, you may step down, Mr. Kringle.
Oh. Thank you.
Mr. Bedford.
In view of your client's statement, do you still wish to offer a defense?
Yes, your honor.
I should like to call my first witness.
Can you tell us your name?
My name is Daniel lowry.
And what'd you get for christmas last year, Daniel?
Um... a bike and, um...
And who gave you the bike?
Him.
What's his name?
Santa Claus.
You're sure he's Santa Claus?
Yep.
How can you be sure?
'Cause he looks like Santa Claus.
Any other reasons?
Oh, he's very nice...
And he works at cole's, and he's got elves.
Well, tell me something, Daniel... could that man be Santa Claus?
Nope.
Why not?
'Cause Santa don't got a grumpy face.
Order.
No further questions.
Um...Mr. Collins, do you wish to cross-examine the witness?
No, your honor. No questions.
Do I have to go to jail now?
No. You can go back to your seat.
Your honor...
I should like to call my next witness.
Mrs. Rebecca collins.
Order.
You swear to tell the whole truth, so help you god?
I do .
Sit down, please.
Do you have children, Mrs. Collins?
I have two.
How old are they?
4 and 7.
Do they believe in Santa Claus?
I object, your honor.
On what grounds, Mr. Collins?
The witness is my wife.
Mr. Bedford is deliberately harassing her solely in order to embarrass me and expose private matters to the court.
Your honor, I'm merely attempting to establish that Mr. Collins,
Like so many others, has taught his children that there is a Santa Claus.
Objection overruled.
You may continue.
Thank you, your honor.
Mrs. Collins, do your children believe in Santa Claus?
Yes.
Did they come to this belief naturally, or were they introduced to it by a family member?
By a family member.
- Yourself.
- Yes.
And your husband.
Uh...yes.
Your husband told your children that there is a Santa Claus?
Yes.
On more than one occasion?
Uh...y-yeah.
Mrs. Collins, have you taken your children to see a department store Santa Claus this year?
Yes, we have.
- Where?
- At cole's.
So your children have met Mr. Kringle.
Oh, yes.
And they accepted him as Santa Claus.
Yes.
Did the question of Mr. Kringle's authenticity arise at any time
Before or after your children met him?
Uh...yes. It was after.
And did you deny...or confirm... that Mr. Kringle is the real Santa Claus?
You're under oath now, Mrs. Collins.
U-um...w-well, actually, my--my husband confirmed that he's the real Santa Claus.
No further questions, your honor.
Thank you, Mrs. Collins.
Merry christmas.
Mr. Collins...do you wish to cross-examine...your wife?
I object, your honor.
This is irrelevant, immaterial, and absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Bedford is making a mockery of this court.
He's not even established that there's such a person as Santa Claus.
Your honor, I would ask Mr. Collins if he could offer any proof that there
Is no Santa Claus.
Your honor, I'd like a recess until tomorrow so that I might Adequately prepare to meet Mr. Bedford's challenge.
Mr. Bedford, do you have any objections?
No, your honor.
This court stands in recess until 9:00 tomorrow morning.
I knew if I got him angry enough, he'd take the offensive.
There's no way in a court of law we can prove Santa Claus exists or that you're him.
Haven't you given him the opportunity of proving that I don't exist?
Exactly. You see, he'll go too far.
Our best defense is to let collins hang himself.
Oh. Oh, I see.
But you have to promise me one thing.
You'll speak only when I tell you to.
You have my word.
Good. Come on.
I, um...I just wanted to thank you for everything that you're doing for Kriss.
I was in the gallery.
I don't know if you saw me.
I still have a long way to go.
I think you'll do it.
I hope you will.
I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
About... last week...
I'm sorry.
I mean it. I'm really, really sorry.
I was...just...
Scared?
Yes.
Well...no permanent damage.
- Well, I'd...
- I have to pick Susan up from school.
Oh, how's she doing?
She's good. She's good.
I think she...misses you.
Tell her I said hello.
Bye.
Oh, indeed, there was.
Saint nicholas, otherwise known as
Santa Claus, was a fourth century
Bishop in myra, lycia--asia minor.
Uh, dr. Hunter, what is the church's position on saint nicholas?
He's a recognized saint.
Yes, but isn't it true that in 1969, pope paul vi eliminated the official celebration of the feast day of saint nicholas?
That's correct.
Uh, it was made an optional memorial day.
They downgraded him.
In essence, the church walked away from saint nicholas.
Doesn't it also stand to reason that they would walk away
From the derivative, diluted, secular figure of Santa Claus?
I...presume so.
Thank you...Dr. Hunter.
But the church has not made it clear what its pos--
No further questions.
It's all right, Kriss.
He's just trying to get under your skin.
Colonel.
Have you ever been to the north pole?
Yes, sir.
In 1972 and again in 1984.
Did you explore the region?
Extensively.
Did you ever find any evidence of dwellings... animal pens, barns, workshops?
No, sir.
No evidence whatsoever?
None, sir.
Tell me something, colonel.
In your opinion, would it be possible for an individual Like, uh,
Mr. Kringle over there to create a settlement in that
Inhospitable region large enough to manufacture at least one toy
For each and every one of the earth's
1.7 billion children?
No, sir.
There isn't any way in which the gentleman can have seen my workshops.
They're invisible.
Kriss, sit down, please.
But Mr. Collins is completely mistaken.
My workshops don't exist in the physical world.
They're in the dream world.
Let me be the lawyer.
I always thought that was completely understood.
Your honor...with the court's permission,
I'd like to call my next witness.
Mr. Collins, what is this?
This...is a reindeer, your honor.
I know, but what's it doing in my courtroom?
I'd like the court to see Mr. Kringle make the reindeer fly.
He's baiting you.
He wants you to lose your temper.
He wants you to act crazy.
Remember that.
Mr. Kringle...we're waiting.
Well...Isn't it.
Well, I would greatly like to oblige Mr. Collins, but I cannot make this reindeer fly.
I didn't think so.
He only flies on christmas eve.
Yes. Of course.
No further questions, your honor.
Then would somebody please remove the witnes-- the animal from the courtroom?
Your honor, the state of new york has no desire in laying waste to a popular myth, but this case is not about mythology.
It's about the mental competency of a man-- that man Kriss kringle.
Everyone in this courtroom, if they were entirely honest with themselves,
Would have to conclude based on the evidence that Mr. Kringle, regrettably, is insane.
As a sworn guardian of the laws of the state of new york,
As a citizen and a father, it is my wish that Mr. Kringle,
Who masquerades as Santa Claus, a figure of benevolence
And generosity, but who does so solely for profit--
That's not true!
Your honor.
Mr. Kringle will refrain from comment, or he will be removed from the courtroom.
Sit down. Sit down, Kriss.
Your honor,
I was not aware that cole's department store was a charitable Institution.
If it is, I'm more than willing to apologize to the court and to Mr. Kringle.
I didn'tthink so, your honor.
As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, it is my wish that Mr. Kringle be placed under the care of the state so that the children of new york will no longer be put at risk.
Hey, you big jerk!
Mr. Kringle's the nicest man in the world!
He'd never hurt anybody!
Order!
Order!
- Sit down!
- Order! Order!
I have nothing further to say, your honor.
Kriss, sit down. We're almost through.
Honey, it's o.k.
Mr. Bedford...do you wish to make a closing statement?
Your honor, a lot of people believe in Mr. Kringle, including millions of children.
If you rule against him, you won't destroy anyone's belief, just the man they believe in.
Mr. Kringle is not concerned for himself.
If he was, he wouldn't be here.
He is in this regrettable position because he is willing to sacrifice himself for children to create in their minds a world far better than the one we've made for them.
If this is, as Mr. Collins suggests, a masquerade, then Mr. Kringle is eager to forfeit his freedom to preserve that masquerade,
To subject himself to prosecution, to protect the children's Right to believe.
If this court finds that Mr. Kringle is not who he says he is, that there is no Santa Clause, then I would ask the court to judge which is worse--
A lie that draws a smile, or a truth... that draws a tear?
I rest my case.
I shall render my opinion on this matter at 12:00 noon tomorrow.
Until that time, this court stands in recess.
Hello, judge.
I appreciate your waiting for me.
Sit down.
How did I get on this case?
I don't want to rule against your client, but I can't see how, given the facts,
I can do otherwise.
A man who believes himself to be someone he isn't is by definition disturbed.
He isn't dangerous.
He isn't a threat.
I can't sit up on that bench as a representative of the state of new york
And declare that there is a Santa Claus.
I can't make that argument, much as I'd like to.
Believe me, Mr. Bedford, if I had a way out of this,
I'd take it.
I'm sorry.
It's all about money, isn't it?
You know what destroyed Kriss kringle?
Power, greed, and this.
Anger and recrimination may soothe your soul, but it won't help Mr. Kringle.
He doesn't need a bitter epilogue from his attorney.
He needs a miracle.
You may sit.
Ahem. Having heard the evidence in the matter of Kriss kringle,
I, judge henry harper, a representative of the state of new york,
Must regrettably rule on this day, the 24th of december, in the year...
Would it please the court if i gave you your christmas card?
I probably won't see you again unless
I get arrested, which is very unlikely,
Since it's christmas eve and I'm going to bed uncharacteristically early.
Thank you very much, young lady.
You're entirely welcome.
And, uh...Merry christmas.
Merry christmas to you.
What are you doing?
Merry christmas
I'm not going to be needing that.
The young lady who just approached the bench presented me with thi christmas card and this.
It's a $1.00 bill.
It's going to be returned to her shortly, but by presenting me With this bill, she reminded me that it's issued by the treasury of the united states of America.
And it's backed by the government, and the people, of the united states of America.
Upon inspection of the article, you will see the words, "in god we trust."
We're not here to prove that god exists, but we are here to prove
That a being just as invisible and yet just as present exists.
Federal government puts its trust in god.
It does so on faith and faith alone.
It's the will of the people that guides the government.
And it is and was their collective faith in a greater being that gave
And gives cause to this bill's inscription.
Now, if the government of the united states can issue its currency bearing a declaration of trust in god without demanding physical evidence of the existence or the nonexistence of a greater being, then the state of new york, by a similar demonstration of the collective faith of its people, can accept and acknowledge that Santa Claus does exist, and he exists In the person of Kriss kringle!
Case dismissed.
Case dismissed!
Santa Claus wins!
All charges have been dropped.
Kriss kringle is free.
Hey!
- How about that.
- Yes!
You're right, Kriss.
- It's all about the children.
- Yes.
Congratulations, counselor.
Thank you.
Merry christmas, Mr. Kringle.
Merry christmas to you, Mr. Collins.
Thank you.
Uh, my children... wanted me to remind you to stop by the house tonight.
I won't forget. I promise.
We live in stanford--31 Shellhammer bromton road, the big white house.
Yes. I know it well.
Yeah. Well... anyway, merry christmas.
Oh, uh, Mr. Collins,
I hope you've taken down that old television antenna.
I ripped my pants on it last year.
Well, Kriss, you're free.
You made a believer out of everybody.
Oh, no. Not everybody.
There are still a few I have to convince.
One in particular.
Excuse me.
Way to go, Bryan.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Walker.
You did a great job, sweetie.
You kicked that guy's bottom.
Well, she saved the day.
Congratulations, Bryan.
Thank you, Dorey.
Have a merry christmas.
You, too.
Well, I'll let you go.
Merry christmas and good luck.
Merry christmas, Mrs. Walker.
And a merry christmas to you, young lady.
And thank you very much.
Merry christmas, Mr. Kringle.
Merry christmas, Bryan.
Again, thank you so much.
I shall never forget you.
And in all my troubles past and all my troubles yet to come,
I'll never find a better friend.
Thank you, Kriss.
Merry christmas.
Merry christmas to you, Bryan.
Hey, you want to share a cab home?
Home?
Not tonight.
I'm going to be somewhat busy.
That's right.
Mr. Kringle! Mr. Kringle! Mr. Kringle!
This is going to blow up in my face, isn't it?
I lost bigger than i ever thought I'd win.
There was a lot of pressure.
Who knew what the judge was going to do when he was faced
With putting Santa in the nut house?
He isn't Santa Claus.
What the hell is the matter with everybody?
There is no Santa Claus!
Is somebody getting married?
Not that I know of.
Did you arrange this?
No. You did.
Oh, i did?
You didn't?
I didn't. Did you?
- I didn't.
- I know you did.
- Oh, no.
- Yes, you did.
You did, didn't you?
I did not.
Father?
Are you ready?
For what?
To get married.
I have something to tell you.
What'd you get for christmas?
Susan, that's not why we're going to the house.
We're going to the catalog house, right?
That's the house i told him I wanted.
I showed him a picture of it.
He said he would get it for me.
A house is a big gift.
That's what Mr. Kringle said.
We are going to the house because it's snowing, and it's very pretty,
And because Mr. Shellhammer wants to take photographs for next year's Christmas catalog, which, I think, is awfully bold of him.
It is a holiday.
That's just an excuse.
Mr. Kringle did all this.
I'm very sorry, mother.
You have it perfectly wrong.
You got a bonus.
What do you mean?
Our name's on the mailbox.
I got a call last night from Mr. Kringle, who said you And your husband were looking for a house.
He was quite insistent.
Did you get married?
Yeah. Last night.
I can't believe it.
Congratulations.
Was this planned?
Uh...no.
I can't believe it.
Mr. Kringle wanted to be here, but, uh, he's overseas.
Mr. Kringle?
Oh, the house is for sale, but I'm sure you can afford it now.
We all get our bonuses thanks to you and, uh, Mr. Kringle.
Wow.
I knew it.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I don't know what to say, except merry christmas.
Merry christmas.
Oh.
Chin-chin.
This is the house I asked Kriss for.
He got it for me, and he got me a dad, and the third thing--
I guess I'll just have to wait for it, but he'll get it for me, won't he?
If Kriss said he'd get you something, i bet it's already on the way.
I guess there's no doubt about it.
He's real.
I'm going up to look at my new room.
Excuse me.
Susan?
What?
What else did you ask Mr. Kringle for?
A baby brother.
See ya!
(feedback/voices overlapping)
I ask you to listen
with an open mind,
forgetting for a moment
what you believe and don't believe.
This is how it started.
On a night like this.
On a two-lane country road
not far from here.
Hey, Jeff!
Pull over!
(honks horn)
(whimpers)
(siren)
(speaks Chinese)
(barking)
It's that same mutt causing all the racket.
He just barks since the other pups were adopted.
Tomorrow you can put him to sleep.
For now, put him in the can.
(whimpers)
(makes petting noises)
Come here, boy. Uncle Jerry's got a special treat for you today.
Stop that dog!
(car horn)
(shrieking and laughing)
(school bell)
(? heavy metal music )
(petting noises)
(petting noises)
Come here, little fellow.
Come on. We'll keep each other warm.
Come on.
Come on.
(chuckles)
(man) These two connecting circles.
They mean forever.
It's beautiful.
- Will you be with me forever?
- Yes, Tommy.
Forever.
"My fancies are fireflies."
"Specks of living light, twinkling in the dark."
Poetry is food for the soul, little puppy.
(sighs)
We've seen better days.
Oh, well. Here, let's play a little game.
Now...
See, we have three walnut shells.
One, two, three. Three walnut shells.
And we put the little jewel under one.
We move 'em around. Move 'em around.
There. Where is it?
Where's the jewel?
Good puppy. Good puppy.
OK. Here we go again.
Now, where is it? Where is it?
Good puppy.
Good puppy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good puppy. Good puppy!
- He's such a smart little guy.
- Thank you.
It was just a fluke.
He's my little fluke.
Yes!
Fluke by nature, Fluke by name.
(coughs and splutters)
I... I don't feel very well, Fluke.
I think I'll take a nap before we go.
(barking)
Rise and shine, squirt.
Don't let 'em catch you sleeping.
That old dogcatcher gets up mighty early lookin' for easy targets just like you.
Did you run away, or did they pull that old "dump the pup" trick?
You can talk?
Don't be goofy. I'm a dog, pal.
But you're not barking.
What you're saying to me are words.
It's a mental thing. It's what I want you to know and what you want me to know.
- That's all it is.
- But... but...
You never met anyone who can communicate?
- No, never.
- Well, now you have.
- They call me Rumbo. What about you?
- Fluke.
Mm-mm.
I smell hunger with a capital H.
- Whaddya say we get something to eat?
- What about Bella?
I'm afraid Bella had to move on, my friend.
You won't be seeing her any more.
Hey, come on. It's chowtime. Let's roll.
Rumbo, help! Help!
Hey, squirt, we're goin' to eat and you're takin' a bath.
Get outta there. Come on.
Come on. You can do it. Come on.
There.
You OK?
Yeah. I'm OK.
Well, that's one way of gettin' rid of your fleas.
What's that... What's that smell?
I mean, I love it. I love it.
- Hey, hey! Be cool. Knock it off.
- Ow!
Come on back here. Come on.
It's taken me years to build this route and I'm not gonna let some rookie ruin it.
Now, you just sit there and watch the master.
Hey, Rumbo. What's goin' on?
What'll it be?
Coming right up, sir.
There you go.
Now, who is this?
Listen, Rumbo, you know
I can't be feeding all your buddies.
(Rumbo) Just let me handle this.
Hey, Bert, how about something for the pup?
I bet you want something for the pup too, huh?
Ow!
Now, you two, out of here.
I got payin' customers to tend to.
Listen up. You're gonna meet the boss, but he don't have patience with dogs, so when he talks to you, just wag your tail and go into your puppy routine.
OK.
You are gonna love this place, kid.
Lots of nice shade and soft places to lay.
It's the only place I know you can chase tyres and not worry about gettin' run over.
(Rumbo chuckles)
Uh-huh, yeah.
All righty. I'll have to call you back, all right?
(coughs)
Rumbo, where the hell you been all night? Huh?
- What do you have, a sweetheart?
- What!
- Just go to him.
- He called me a girl.
People make mistakes. Now forgive him and get over there and wag your tail.
- What's he doing?
- He's being affectionate.
- Well, it hurts.
- Well, love hurts.
What's this say?
"Fluke". What the hell kinda name is that?
Ah, that's a nice dog.
(whimpers)
(Rumbo) Hey. Hey!
- What's going on?
- I guess I was dreaming.
- You were what?!
- Uh, dreaming.
I was seeing pictures inside my head.
Pictures ain't got no business being inside your head.
Next time you just growl and chase 'em away.
Rumbo, have you always been a dog?
What you talkin' about?
What else could I have been?
- I don't know. A human.
- A two-legger? Me?
Rule number one: stop askin' dumb questions.
- It's just that...
- No "buts", no "ifs", no "ands".
Stop talking all this nonsense.
It's sack time.
Good night.
Good night, Rumbo.
(Rumbo) Oh, man!
This is too good to be true.
- What are we gonna do, Rumbo?
- Take a good look, squirt.
We done hit the promised land.
- Oh, holy smoke!
- D'you think this'll be all right?
All right? The guy walked away.
That's what I consider formal invitation.
- (Fluke) Everything smells so good.
- Mm-hm.
Mm-mm! (chuckles)
I knew I smelled pumpkin!
Hey!
(Bert) Yeah, so I'm sittin' there just waitin' for the light, this woman bangs into the back of my car.
$500 damage and they raise my insurance rates.
Now you tell me if that makes any sense.
(barking)
Fluke?
- Fluke. Cool it.
- (customer coughing)
- Don't mind that dog. He's harmless.
- (Rumbo) What's with you?
There's something about him.
Can't you smell it, Rumbo?
That'll be $1 .85.
All right. Thank you.
Oops.
Sorry about that.
Hey! Hey!
Get off me!
- Fluke, cut that out.
- That dog is vicious. He attacked me.
You can't keep a dog like that in a public place. Hear what I said?
I heard you. Now go on, man.
You're making the dogs nervous.
Go on, get outta here!
It's all right. Everything's all right.
Shh, shh. It's all right.
It's all right. Quiet. It's OK.
Sorry, pooch. l guess you're gonna have to find something else to read.
What's up?
You look like you just saw a ghost.
- I saw someone I used to know.
- An old friend?
I think... he's a murderer.
I hear they were your dogs.
- My dogs never bit anybody normal.
- Well, that dog ought to be put to sleep.
The dogs had their shots and you won't die from that scratch.
I could complain to Animal Control.
I could make a lot of trouble for you.
Mike...
All right?
Now get outta here.
(Rumbo) Uh-oh. l think it's time to split.
Hey! Hey, Rumbo! Rumbo!
Rumbo, get back here!
Come on in. Time for supper.
Daddy's back.
Hey! Hey, Rumbo! I see you.
You're gonna get yours.
OK, Fluke. You did your time.
(ringing tone)
(woman) Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
- (licking)
- Who's this?
What the hell...!
Hey, Fluke! Hey! Fluke!
(groans)
Oh, these dogs.
Hello?
Hello?
- Hello?
- Hi. Who's calling?
You called, lady. Who you lookin' for?
No, you called me. Who is this?
I didn't call anybody. The only other person in this office was Fluke, and he couldn't have called because he's a dog, lady.
Rumbo, I wasn't always a dog.
And neither were you.
Right! Last week I was Snow White.
Well, how do you know who Snow White is?
It's something you knew in your past, read in a book.
- That's ridiculous.
- You can't face it. You're lying to yourself.
- I'm happy who I am.
- But I'm not.
I lived in a house. I had a family.
I had a life once, Rumbo.
- You got one now. A damn good one.
- I'm gonna find them.
If you're gonna go chasing after humans in your head, you're going alone.
And don't bother coming back!
Rumbo! Wait!
Get him in the truck.
- There you go.
- You're right. He's just the right size.
(machine beeping)
(horn)
Forever.
(beeping quickens)
What's going on, Sylvester?
(alarm)
- We gotta get outta here. Can you walk?
- I think so.
Got it. Now let's roll.
- Rumbo, I can't see.
- Grab my tail.
Ow! Hey, easy with the teeth, now.
Watch your step.
Here we go. Blue skies ahead.
- Shoot the dog.
- I can't shoot the dog!
Maybe we should stop here for a minute.
They'll never find us here. l think maybe I'll lay down for a while.
- How are your eyes?
- A little better.
Rumbo, you're bleeding.
Listen to me, squirt. You stay in these woods until your eyes heal.
What do you mean? I'm staying with you.
I don't think
I can help you any more, squirt.
Rumbo, why you talking like this?
You're gonna be all right.
Forget it. There's nothing you can do.
Come closer.
Look, we've got to stay together.
You and me, like always.
I can't make it without you, Rumbo.
I had another dream.
My family's in danger.
Fluke, things aren't always what they seem.
Rule number one: there's no going back.
You can't be sorry about what's been, squirt. You got to be.
Please. I have to know.
Am I the only one?
You were a man once, too.
Weren't you, Rumbo?
Remember that snapshot behind old Bert's counter?
That was me. In another life.
Bert was my brother.
Hm. I never really missed being a two-legger.
But the sea...
Huh. I wish l could smell the sea again.
All I know is you were the best friend I ever had.
I'll miss you.
Rumbo, don't leave me.
Maybe we'll meet again, squirt.
Next time around.
No.
Rumbo?
(sobs) No.
Rumbo's words kept ringing in my ears.:
"There's no going back."
But my family was in danger.
I had to go to them.
(bell ringing)
- We're gonna be late.
- Wait up.
(school bell)
Let's go.
(school bell)
Cool. Hey, boy.
(girl) Oh, sweet puppy.
(girl) Neat dog.
(engine starts)
Move it, pooch.
(gasps)
Get down. Get away. Look at this!
- Mom, he's not gonna bite us.
- Get down!
Get away.
This dog is crazy.
Get down! Get away from the car!
What is with this dog?
Brian, shut your door. Shut it. Shut it.
What's wrong with it?
I've never seen a dog act like this.
Mom, the windows are up.
He can't do anything to us.
Let's go. We're going home.
My god, it scared me.
(Fluke barking)
- It's the dog from school.
- No, no, Brian. Don't open the door.
What's going on?
My god. How did he get here?
Uh, that's OK, Libby, thanks.
Mom, we have to feed him.
He must have run all the way here.
Come away from the door. Come on.
- He must be thirsty.
- Brian, we know nothing about that dog.
Stubborn dog.
- Brian, come and eat.
- l'm not hungry.
There's a big juicy cheeseburger here with your name on it.
Come on and eat your supper. l don't think I can eat with that sad creature staring in at me.
He probably hasn't eaten for days.
All right.
He can stay for just one meal, then he's gone. Deal?
Deal.
- Ah!
- I told you, Mom. He's really nice.
- Good boy.
- (sneezes)
Bless you! I think he likes us.
- Do you think anybody owns him?
- Well, let's see if he's got a tag here.
Here it is. Oh, there's no address. lt just says "Fluke".
Hi, Fluke.
Fluke.
Mom, I know we made a deal and I respect it.
But can't we keep him... just for a little while?
Brian, why don't you get up off the floor?
Just until we find his owner?
You can't put him on the street now.
I mean, he could be hit by a car.
You are just like your father.
A con artist.
Your father used to brag he could sell ice cubes to the Eskimos.
Well...
He can stay on one condition. He has to have a bath right now. He's filthy.
(groans)
Energise.
(imitates gunfire)
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Fluke, have you seen Data?
Hey.
My dad used to do that.
(whimpers)
OK, Fluke, this is your bed for the night.
I'll see you in the morning.
(gasps)
What are you doing here?
- See you later, Fluke.
- Come on, Brian. We're gonna be late.
What's the matter, Fluke? Hm?
What's the matter?
You're a sweet boy.
You're a very sweet dog.
Playing with Brian, doing things that
I never had time for when I was a man,
made me realise
how precious every moment is.
This was where I belonged.
Somehow, sooner or later,
I'd find a way to tell them who I really was.
(clatter)
Brian!
(gasps)
Fluke...
Did you escape from a circus, or what?
Tom looked so silly in this hat.
- Ready, Brian?
- All right. Come on, Fluke! Let's go.
# We're off to see the Wizard
# The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
# Because, because, because, because, because
# Because of the wonderful things he does
# We're... off to see the Wizard
# The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
# Because, because, because, because, because...
(Audrey Hepburn) I love you.
More than you know.
(Tom) She was even more beautiful
than I remembered.
I would have given anything
to tell her how much I loved her.
(Audrey Hepburn) More than fields
I have planted with my hands.
- I love you more than morning prayers.
- Shh, Fluke. Stop whining.
- I'm trying to watch the movie.
- It's OK, Fluke.
(vehicle approaches)
- (knock at door)
- Come in. The door's open.
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hi.
- No, Fluke! No!
- Jeff!
No. Fluke!
- Fluke, no!
- What are you gonna do to him?
Please, don't hurt him!
(Jeff) Open the door!
You all right?
- Hello. Give me Animal Control.
- Don't call them!
Brian, please! No, no, we've got a dog that's going crazy on our front lawn.
Brian, honey, go to your room.
It'll be OK. Please, go.
Yes, please.
6241 Willow Drive.
I don't know what got into him, why he's acting like this.
Well, something's wrong with that dog.
- Good evening.
- What's the problem, sir?
Well, my friend's kid brought home some stray that just went berserk. It bit me.
It's a large, brown mutt.
He might still be around here somewhere.
I don't know.
- (officer) We won't find him out there.
- (officer #2) He's gone.
- We'll call Animal Control in the morning.
- Thanks for coming out.
If it happens again, give us a call.
Well, there's nothing more I can do.
- Are you OK? I mean...
- Yeah. It didn't break the skin.
Don't go yet. Why don't you stay for a bit?
- (Jeff) They'll take him to the pound.
- I don't wanna call the pound.
You know what they do to dogs there.
I can't do that to Brian.
- Don't whine. They'll hear.
- (mother) Something about that dog...
- Brian?
- Yes, Mom?
- You OK?
- Yeah. I just need a Kleenex.
- 'Night, kiddo.
- 'Night, sweetheart.
Quiet, Fluke.
Come, Fluke.
Good boy.
(Jeff) Listen, it came off the streets.
You don't know where it's from.
- It just wasn't a good idea to let him in.
- I don't know what came over him.
But he attacked me, which means he could easily turn and attack either of you.
Maybe he was trying to protect us.
Brian has become attached to that dog.
I haven't seen him this happy in years.
What about you?
Are you OK?
- I've been thinking about Tom a lot lately.
- Me, too.
- (mother) You think he's happy?
- I hope so.
I keep thinking maybe if I'd... If I'd only known what he was going through.
Listen, l thought that we agreed we weren't gonna do the "ifs" any more.
I think that we've got to try to... put this behind us.
I love you, Fluke.
Oh, hey, hey, hey! Good morning, huh?
(coughs)
What's going on?
- You're so warm.
- Mom, I've gotta find...
Go back to bed.
I wanna take your temperature.
- But, Mom...
- You're going nowhere. You have a fever.
Go on. Back to bed.
- Morning, Rose.
- You're early this morning, Mr Newman.
- How was the trip?
- Work.
A lot of hard work, Rose, as usual.
Well, I hear you're actually taking a vacation this year.
Well, Carol made me promise.
Now, is that likely to turn into a honeymoon?
Well, if I had my way, it would.
How is she?
Much better, thanks.
She still misses him at times, but we all do.
Yes, we do.
- Have a good one.
- You, too.
Jane, can you please bring me that file?
- How'd it go?
- Fine, thanks.
- ls that it?
- Yeah, this is it.
No, I mean for the night.
My family's waiting.
And your wife called.
You have dinner reservations at 8.30.
Listen, could you please call her and tell her that l won't be able to make it.
- Anything else?
- No.
- Thank you.
- Just don't stay too late, Mr Johnson.
Good night.
Good night.
I see our brave captain is still at the helm.
(phone rings)
(footsteps)
(phone ringing)
(Carol) Jeff, it's me.
But... you called Tom's old office.
I did? Oh, God, I'm so scared.
- What's happened?
- I can't find Brian.
All I can think is that he's out looking for that dog.
Jeff, he has a fever and it is already below freezing outside.
Listen, I'm leaving right now.
We'll find him. Everything will be fine.
- Hurry.
- Bye-bye.
(growling)
I didn't care if I was dying or not.
I'd had my revenge.
Then suddenly it came to me
and I remembered what really happened.
I see our brave captain is still at the helm.
Somebody's gotta work. Especially in a business whose profits are off 30%.
You've heard we're in a slowdown?
Everybody's off.
So what's the cure? Everybody go home at five o'clock every night?
It's 8.45.
What d'you think of the prototype?
I asked them to set it up for you.
- Did you notice?
- I read your specs.
It's twice as efficient as any braking system around.
- But it's twice as expensive.
- It could save thousands of lives.
Maybe, but it's not cost-effective.
Not cost-effective! I never thought
I'd hear something like that from you.
When we started, we wanted to combine our talents to do something positive.
- Make money by helping people.
- We were young then. It's different now.
- I don't believe that. Neither do you.
- It's so easy for you to criticise my life.
Do you have any idea how many responsibilities I have? No.
No, cos you don't live in the real world.
You're a dreamer. Always have been.
I'll take that as a compliment.
We're not going to throw money away on your dreams.
- This company is in trouble...
- No, our company is not in trouble.
It's just a slow period and you think it's the end of the world.
Tom, what the hell is wrong with you?
You've got the kind of life that any man would envy. I envy it.
- You've got a great wife, a beautiful kid...
- Leave them out of it.
Like you do?
We're not gonna develop this system.
As a partner and head of Design,
I say we are.
As a partner and head of Finance,
I say that we're not!
Not!
Hey, you've lost it.
I don't even recognise you any more.
Come back here.
We're gonna settle this now.
Come back here!
Pull over!
Pull over.
Are you crazy?
You're gonna get us both killed!
Let's talk about this, can we, like a couple of adults. lt's useless trying to race because you know I always win.
Tom!
Tom!
Oh, God. Tom?
Tom?
(sobs)
Oh, God! Tom...
Oh, what had I done?
Everything had been my fault.
Jeff had always been a true friend.
Even after my death.
I had to help him.
Fluke.
Go find Brian. He's sick.
He can't stay out in this cold.
Go find him.
(Brian) Daddy?
Daddy?
I can't find him anywhere.
Maybe from where you are, you can see Fluke.
Help me find Fluke, Daddy. Please.
Please.
Mr. Grimes!
Hey, Mr. Grimes! Wait!
Mr. Grimes!
Wait!
I know where he is.
Fluke.
I knew you'd come.
(barking)
Brian!
Brian. Brian. It's Mommy.
Hi, Mom.
Come on.
- Fluke kept me warm, Mom.
- OK. Let's go to the car. Come on.
OK, put your arms around my neck.
Here you go.
OK.
I was dreaming, Mom.
I was dreaming, and Fluke spoke to me.
He told me not to cry.
He said he had to go away.
OK, stay here and keep warm.
I'll be right back.
Come, Fluke.
Come with us.
Come on, boy.
Let's go home now.
Come on, Fluke.
Of course, I had to go away.
I loved them too much
to get in the way of their happiness.
Jeff would be there now,
in a way that I hadn't been.
I didn't know how to live as a man
and I didn't know how to live as a dog.
Now I understand that life is something
to be cherished in every form.
So this is my story.
Perhaps I was made to remember
so that I could share it with you.
And perhaps there are
many out there like me,
hiding behind the eyes
of simple creatures.
Maybe even someone close to you.
Rise and shine, squirt.
Don't let 'em catch you sleepin'.
Rumbo?
Ha-ha! You didn't think you could get rid of me that easy now, did you, squirt?
- Rumbo, I can't believe it's you.
- You better believe it.
Come on over here. Come here.
We've got a lot to talk about.
But first, let me tell you something about being a squirrel.
Rule number one...

ENHOH
Once upon a time in a faraway land... a young prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired... the prince was spoiled, selfish and unkind.
But then, one winter's night... an old beggar woman came to the castle... and offered him a single rose... in return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance... the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances... for beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away... to reveal a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late... for she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast... and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form... the beast concealed himself inside his castle... with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The rose she had offered... was truly an enchanted rose... which would bloom until his 21 st year.
If he could learn to love another... and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell... then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed... to remain a beast for all time.
As the years passed... he fell into despair and lost all hope... for who could ever learn to love a beast?
Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town full of little people
Waking up to say
There goes the baker with his tray like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
- To this poor provincial town
- Good morning, Belle.
- Morning, monsieur.
- Where you off to?
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story...
- about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
- That's nice.
Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up!
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your family
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your wife
- I need six eggs
- That's too expensive
There must be more than this provincial life
- Ah, Belle!
- Good morning.
- I've come to return the book I borrowed.
- Finished already?
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?
Not since yesterday.
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.
That one?
But you've read it twice!
Well, it's my favourite!
Far-off places... daring sword fights, magic spells, a prince in disguise.
If you like it all that much, it's yours.
- But, sir!
- I insist.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
- With a dreamy, far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle
Oh
Isn't this amazing
It's my favourite part
Because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him
Till chapter three
Hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Now it's no wonder that her name means beauty
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
- You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!
- I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you...
- and no girl, for that matter.
- It's true, Lefou.
And I've got my sights set on that one.
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one!
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But she...
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- I know, but...
That makes her the best!
- And don't I deserve the best?
- Well, of course! I mean, you do!
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle
Look, there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute
- Bonjour
- Good day
- You call this bacon
- What lovely grapes
- Some cheese
- Ten yards
- Excuse me - I'll get the knife - Please let me through
- This bread, it's stale - Those fish, they smell - Madame's mistaken
There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife
Look, there she goes, a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston, may I have my book, please?
How can you read this?
There's no pictures!
Well, some people use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books... and paid attention to more important things.
Like me.
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking.
- Gaston, you are positively primeval.
- Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern...
- and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.
- What's wrong with her? -
She's crazy. - He's gorgeous!
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.
Goodbye.
That crazy old loon!
He needs all the help he can get.
Don't talk about my father that way!
Yeah! Don't talk about her father that way!
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius!
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?
I- I'm a... I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk.
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!
I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work!
Yes, you will, and you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow.
- Hmph!
- And become a world-famous inventor.
- You really believe that?
- I always have.
Well, what are we waitin' for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.
Hand me that... the... the... the dog-legged clincher there.
So, did you have a good time in town today?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know. It's just that
I'm not sure I fit in here.
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
H- He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome, all right, and rude and conceited and...
- Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
- Well, don't you worry...
'cause this invention's gonna be the start of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
- It works!
- It does?
- It does!
- You did it!
You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!
Goodbye, Papa.
Good luck!
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.
We should be there by now.
Maybe we missed a turn.
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.
No. Let's go this way.
Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Back up, back up, back up!
Good boy! Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!
Steady, steady, now.
Steady.
Steady. No, Philippe!
Philippe?
Oh.
Help!
Is... Is someone there?
Help!
Oh!
Wha... Oh!
Hello?
Hello!
Poor fellow must have lost his way in the woods.
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.
Is someone there?
Not a word, Lumiere.
Not one word!
I- I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse... and... and I need a place to stay for the night.
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
Shh!
O- O-Ow! Ow! Ow!
Of course, monsieur, you are welcome here.
Who said that?
Over here.
- Where?
- Hello.
Incredible!
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.
Splendid! Just peachy!
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once!
Stop that! Hee-hee-hee.
Stop that, I say!
Sir, close that at once!
- Do you mind?
- I-I beg your pardon?
It's... It's just that I've never seen a clock that...
Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur.
Come.
Warm yourself by the fire.
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!
You know what the master will do if he finds him here.
I demand that you stop right there!
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!
I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this!
Well, hello there, boy.
- Oh, what service!
- All right!
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...
Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.
No! No tea. No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama!
Oh! Hello!
Uh-oh.
There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so...
Master, I'd like to take this moment to say...
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I- I-I was lost in the woods and...
- You are not welcome here!
- I-I-I'm sorry.
- What are you staring at?
- N-Nothing.
So, you've come to stare at the beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
I- I just needed a place to stay.
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day.
I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.
First I better go in there and propose to the girl.
And you, Lefou, now, when
Belle and I come out that door...
Oh, I know! I know!
I- I strike up the band!
- Not yet!
- Sorry.
Oh!
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day...
This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty!
Here. Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs.
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?
No, Belle.
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.
- Do you know who that little wife will be?
- Let me think.
- You, Belle.
- Gaston, I'm...
I'm speechless.
I really don't know what to say.
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but... but I just don't deserve you!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife.
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy!
Is he gone?
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it
Madame Gaston his little wife
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it
I want much more than this provincial life
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned
Philippe! What are you doing here? Where's...
Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Papa!
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we?
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
- Pet the pooch!
- I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Papa? Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama.
I saw her.
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What...
A girl!
I saw a girl in the castle!
See, I told ya!
Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy eared, slack-jawed...
Papa?
Did you see that?
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!
- She has come to break the spell!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Papa?
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait!
I'm looking for my father. I...
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
I- Is anyone here?
- Belle?
- Papa!
- H-H-How did you find me?
- Oh, your hands are like ice.
- We have to get you out of there.
- Belle, I want you to leave this place.
- Who's done this to you?
- No time to explain.
- You must go. Now!
- I won't leave you.
- What are you doing here?
- Run, Belle!
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
- Can't you see he's sick?
- Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
Oh, there must be some way
I can... Wait!
- Take me instead.
- You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no! You don't know what you're doing!
If I did, would you let him go?
Yes, but you must promise to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
- You have my word.
- Done!
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.
- Wait! -
Belle! - Wait!
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out.
Please let me out!
Let me out!
Please! Please!
- Master?
- What?
Uh, since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time...
I was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
- I didn't get to say goodbye.
- I'll show you to your room.
My room?
But I thought...
- You wanna... You wanna stay in the tower?
- No.
Then follow me.
- Say something to her.
- Huh? Oh.
I, uh, hope you like it here.
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like except the west wing.
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything, my servants will attend you.
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with the wrong man.
- No one says no to Gaston!
- Darn right!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more than I can bear.
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never!
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favourite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard
To see why
No one's
Slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect
A pure paragon
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
No one's
Been like Gaston a kingpin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston
As a specimen yes, I'm intimidating
My, what a guy that Gaston
Give 5 hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips
Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips
No one
Fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one as burly and brawny
As you see
I've got biceps to spare
- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
- That's right!
And every last inch of me's covered with hair
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
I'm especially good at expectorating
- Ptooey!
- Ten points for Gaston
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge
No one
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers in all of my decorating
My, what a guy
Gaston
- Help! Someone help me!
- Maurice?
Please! Please, I need your help.
He's got her... He's got her locked in the dungeon!
- Who?
- Belle. We must go.
Not... Not a minute to lose.
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!
- Is it a big beast?
- Huge!
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly!
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes! Will you help me?
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.
You will? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Crazy old Maurice.
He's always good for a laugh.
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking
- A dangerous pastime
- I know
But that wacky old coot is Belle's father
And his sanity's only so-so
Now, the wheels in my head have been turning
Since I looked at that loony old man
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle
And right now
I'm evolving a plan
- If I...
- Yes?
- Then we...
- No, would she?
- Guess!
- Now I get it!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
No one
Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots like Gaston
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston
So his marriage we soon will be celebrating
My, what a guy
Gaston
Will no one help me?
- Who is it?
- Mrs Potts, dear.
I thought you might like a spot of tea.
But you're...
You're a...
- Oh! Careful.
- This is impossible!
I know it is, but here we are.
I told you she was pretty, Mama, didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now.
- Don't spill.
- Thank you.
Wanna see me do a trick?
- Chip!
- Oops, sorry.
That was a very brave thing you did, my dear.
- We all think so.
- But I've lost my father... my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me... jabberin' on while there's a supper to get on the table.
- Chip?
- Bye!
Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers.
Oh, how embarrassing!
Ahem.
Ah, here we are!
You'll look ravishing in this one!
That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner.
Ah, but you must!
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.
Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Oh, try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day.
Master, have you thought that perhaps... this girl could be the one to break the spell?
Of course I have!
I'm not a fool.
Good!
So, you fall in love with her... she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.
But the rose has already begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!
Oh, you must help her to see past all that.
I don't know how.
Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.
Ah, yes. When she comes in, give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come.
Show me the smile.
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.
And above all, you must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who? Oh, ha ha ha!
The girl, yes. The girl.
Well, actually, she's in the process of...
Circumstances being what they are...
Uh, she's not coming.
What!
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence!
Let's not be hasty!
- I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
- I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong, but that may not be... the best way to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!
Suave, genteel.
It would give me great pleasure... if you would join me for dinner.
And we say please.
- Please.
- No, thank you.
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch at the door... and inform me at once if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me, mon capitaine.
Well, we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she refuses.
Wh-Wh-What...
What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad once you get to know him.
- Why don't you give him a chance?
- I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want to have anything to do with him.
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me as anything... but a monster.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
I've been burnt by you before.
Zut alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long, and for what?
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn!
After all, he did say please.
But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper, he'll never break the...
Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.
- This is Lumiere.
- EnchantÃ©, chÃ©rie.
If there's... stop that... anything we... please... can do... to make your stay more comfortable...
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?
Hear that?
She's hungry!
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Oh, pish tosh! I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine. Glass of water, crust of bread and then...
Cogsworth,
I am surprised at you!
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest!
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.
If the master finds out about this, it will be our necks.
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner without a little music?
Music?
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure... that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax.
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents... your dinner.
Be our guest
Be our guest
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chÃ©rie and we provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff
It's delicious
Don't believe me
Ask the dishes
They can sing
They can dance
After all, miss this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest
Beef ragout, cheese soufflÃ©
Pie and pudding en flambÃ©
We'll prepare and serve with flair a culinary cabaret
You're alone and you're scared but the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes, I do tricks with my fellow candlesticks
Und it's all in perfect taste that you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be our guest if you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest
Be our guest, be our guest
Be our guest
Life is so unnerving for a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Get off!
Ah, those good old days when we were useful
- Huh?
- Suddenly those good old days are gone
- Oh!
- Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills
Most days wejust lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and upsy-daisy
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear, that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft- Shoein'
I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin'
I'll get warm, pipin'hot
Heaven sakes, is that a spot
Clean it up
We want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two
- For you, our guest
- She's our guest
- She's our guest
- Be our guest
- Be our guest, be our guest Our command is your request
- Let's go, people. Fun's over. Over here. Line up.
It's ten years since we've had anybody here and we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you
We'll keep going
Course by course
One by one
Till you shout
Enough, I'm done
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please be our
Guest
- Bravo! That was wonderful!
- Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now.
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.
- Oh, would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me. I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle.
Oh, well! Actually, I...
Yes, I do.
As you can see, the pseudo-facade was stripped away... to reveal the minimalist rococo design.
Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example of the late neoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say, if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the...
Uh, mademoiselle?
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what he's hiding up there.
- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would, uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to...
- Maybe later.
- Uh, the... the gardens... or, or the... the library perhaps?
You have a library?
- Yes! Oh, indeed.
- With books.
- Scads of books!
- Mountains of books!
- Forests of books!
- Cascades!
- Cloudbursts!
- Swamps of books!
More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever studied... by every author who ever set pen to paper.
By every author who ever set pen to paper.
Oh, oh.
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize what you could have done?
Please! Stop!
- Get out!
- No!
Get out!
- Where are you going?
- Promise or no promise...
I can't stay here another minute.
No, wait, please!
Please wait!
No!
Here, now. Don't do that.
Just hold still.
- That hurts!
- If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing!
Well, you should learn to control your temper!
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
By the way, thank you for saving my life.
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night... but he said you'd make it worth my while.
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle.
But she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat!
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is,
Belle would do anything... to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So you want me to throw her father into the asylum... unless she agrees to marry you.
Unless she agrees to marry you.
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!
If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone!
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...
I'll get her out of there.
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.
Guess it's not gonna work after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do, we'll be ready for them.
Lefou, don't move from that spot... until Belle and her father come home.
But... But I...
Ah, nuts!
I've never felt this way about anyone.
I want to do something for her, but what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.
Ah, no, no, it has to be something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!
Belle?
There's something
I want to show you.
But first, you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
- Can I open them?
- No, no. N-Not yet.
Wait here.
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now!
I can't believe it!
I've never seen so many books in all my life.
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful!
- Then it's yours.
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.
What? What works?
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.
There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought
That this could be
True
That he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see
- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul
- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who indeed
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own
- It's so peculiar, wait and see
- We'll wait a see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before
You know, perhaps there is something there that wasn't there before
What?
There may be something there that wasn't there before
- What's there, Mama?
- Shh.
I'll tell you when you're older.
Right, then, you all know why we're here.
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds... to create the most magical, spontaneous... romantic atmosphere known to man or beast.
Right. Need I remind you... that as the last petal falls from this rose... the spell will never be broken!
Very well. You all know your assignments.
Half of you to the west wing, half of you to the east wing... the rest of you, come with me.
Lighten up, Cogsworth, and let nature take its course.
It's obivious there's a spark between them.
Yes, but there's no harm in fanning the flames, you know... a little.
Besides, they must fall in love tonight if we ever expect to be human again.
- Ah, human again.
- Human again.
Yes, think what that means.
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again
Which should cause several husbands alarm
I'll hop down off this shelf and tout suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again
Be human again
Only human again
We'll be knick-knacks and what-nots no more
When we're human again
Good and human again
Oh, cherie, we'll be only top drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge and I won't be so huge
Why I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns
I'll have hair
It's my birth to be human again
When we're human again
Only human again
When the world once more starts making sense
I'll unwind for a change
Really that would be strange
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks
- And relax
- When I'm human again
So sweep fast round the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now
Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dustbin and broom
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now
Open the shutters and let in some air
Put these here and put those over there
Sweep up the years of sadness and tears
And throw them away
We'll be human again
Only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin'again
We're assumin'again
We'll assume our long lost joie de vivre
We'll be playin'again
Holidayin'again
And we're prayin'its'A.S.A.P.
We will push
We will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again
"There never was a story of more woe
"Than this of Juliet and her Romeo"
- Could you read it again?
- Here, why don't you read it to me?
Uh, all right.
- I can't.
- You mean, you never learned?
I learned... a little.
It's just been so long.
Well, here, I'll help you.
- Let's start here.
- Here.
- Okay. "Twoh..."
- "Two."
"Two." I knew that.
"Two households..."
We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding
As fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn when we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human
Again
Tonight is the night.
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold! Daring!
There will be music, romantic candlelight... provided by myself.
And when the moment is right, you confess your love.
Yes, I con...
I, I... No, I can't.
- You care for the girl, don't you?
- More than anything.
Well, then you must tell her.
Voila! Oh, you look so... so...
Stupid.
Not quite the word
I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.
Your lady awaits.
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Everjust the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Everjust as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Shh.
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love.
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see my father again just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way.
This mirror will show you anything... anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa! Oh, no!
He's sick. He may be dying, and he's all alone.
- Then you-you must go to him.
- What did you say?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean, I'm free?
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.
Take it with you so you'll always have a way... to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say... everything is going just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in you.
I let her go.
Yes, yes, splen...
You what?
How could you do that?
- I had to.
- Yes, but, but, but... but why?
Because I love her.
He did what?
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time, he's finally learned to love.
That's it then.
That should break the spell!
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
Papa? Papa?
They're back.
- Belle!
- Shh.
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
- I missed you so much!
- But the beast...
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
- Hi!
- Oh, a stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Y... Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us any more?
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
It's just that...
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was... I mean, he was... he was, uh, enormous!
I'd... I'd say at least eight, uh, no, more like ten feet!
Well, you don't get much crazier than that!
It's true, I tell you!
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!
No! You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding if...
- If what?
- If you marry me.
- What?
- One little word, Belle.
- That's all it takes.
- Never!
- Have it your way!
- Belle? Let go of me!
My father's not crazy and I can prove it!
Show me the beast.
- Is it dangerous?
- Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, I-I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle.
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better...
I'd think you had feelings for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are!
She's as crazy as the old man!
The beast will make off with your children.
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No!
We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall!
I say we kill the beast!
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me
Through the mist, through the woods through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there at the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead
Good and dead
- Kill the beast
- No, I won't let you do this.
If you're not with us, you're against us.
- Bring the old man!
- Get your hands off me!
We can't have them running off to warn the creature!
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!
- Who's with me?
- I am! I am!
- I am!
- Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist, to a wood where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest till he's good and deceased
Sally forth, tally-ho
Grab your sword and your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go
We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?
Now, now.
We'll think of something.
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the beast
I knew it. I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all.
- Could it be?
- Is it she?
Sacrebleu! Invaders!
- Encroachers!
- And they have the mirror!
Warn the master. If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them.
Who's with me?
Take whatever booty you can find.
But remember, the beast is mine!
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come 50 strong
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the beast
- Pardon me, Master.
- Leave me in peace.
But, sir, the castle is under attack!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
- This isn't working.
- Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!
Wait! I know!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
What shall we do, Master?
It doesn't matter now.
Just let them come.
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Now!
Yes!
Here we go!
What the devil?
Belle, look out!
You guys gotta try this thing.
Up here, you scurvy scum.
Now!
And stay out!
Get up!
What's the matter, beast?
Too kind and gentle to fight back?
No!
- Belle!
- No, Gaston, don't!
Let's go, Philippe.
Come on out and fight!
Were you in love with her, beast?
Did you honestly think she'd want you... when she had someone like me?
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything. Anything!
Get out!
- Beast!
- Belle.
Belle?
You came back.
You... You came back.
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...
Oh, this is all my fault.
If only I'd gotten here sooner.
Maybe it's better... it's better this way.
Don't talk like that.
You'll be all right.
We're together now. Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.
At least...
I got to see you one last time.
No! No!
Please! Please!
Please don't leave me.
I love you.
Belle, it's me!
It is you!
Lumiere!
Cogsworth!
Mrs Potts!
- Look at us!
- Mama! Mama!
- Oh, my goodness!
- It is a miracle!
Ah, I'amour.
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh, but I believe I told you.
No, you didn't. I told you!
You most certainly did not, you pompous, paraffin-headed peabrain!
En garde, you-you overgrown pocket watch!
- Take that!
- Stop shoving.
Are they gonna live happily ever after, Mama?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Everjust the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before and everjust as sure
As the sun will rise
Everjust the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Everjust as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme

- 950 grams. Nice and juicy.
- That's a shoulder piece, isn't it?
The Kube brothers get what they always get. Tell me about it!
- How much do we owe you?
- Two sacks.
Oh, it's Mr Interligator.
How's the wife?
She's doing poorly.
- Roger, your shawl.
- But I've got my shawl.
So she tried to commit suicide again?
By some miracle, she's alive.
Butcher, I think...
- you're getting a customer.
- Who's next?
I am.
- That for me?
- At your service.
Put it on my bill.
We all know where she keeps her bill.
OK, you're next.
That damn carburettor.
This has happened before.
That'll cost you... Iet's see... the ride plus the luggage...
How are you paying?
- In lentils?
- That's all I have left.
Listen, I'd settle for those shoes.
- We're closed for the day.
- I didn't come about that.
I don't eat meat anyway.
- I came about the ad.
- What ad?
- The ad in the paper.
- What paper?
Hard Times.
Hold on...
"Light maintenance jobs.
Odd jobs. Room and board."
"Room facing south."
I do have the right address, don't I?
Number 129a?
Whether here or there, this is nowhere.
That way we don't get hassled by the neighbours.
Nor by any visitors.
Well...
I must have made a mistake.
Not so fast.
You're looking for a job, right?
Come over here.
- Turn around.
- Pardon me?
Turn around.
How much do you weigh?
63 or 64 kilos. Why?
You're not exactly hefty.
The job I've got takes muscle.
- Don't worry about that.
- I'm a butcher.
I'm straight with people. So I'd say you haven't got what it takes.
You don't have the body structure, the right breadth.
Nonetheless I'll give you a try.
But you'll have to bust your ass.
I'd call that a stroke of luck.
- Thanks.
- Come on, let's go.
So what exactly does the job entail?
Light maintenance jobs. Odd jobs.
Room and board. Room facing south.
- Just like in the ad?
- What do you know? Like in the ad.
Hey, watch it. One of the steps is loose. You'll have to fix that.
And do all the painting, cleaning, the electricity. The whole shebang.
You'll like it here, you'll see.
And there aren't any neighbours opposite. The key is on this nail.
Well, I'll let you get settled in.
Thanks.
- How are things in town?
- Terrible. Really terrible.
It's the rationing. They'd eat their shoes. Kind of touch and go.
- They haven't got any street smarts.
- It's a mess. Till things grow back.
Nothing will ever grow back. Ever.
- You're quite the optimist.
- Get that through your thick skull.
- Well, is your hair growing back?
- No.
You see? It's the same thing.
Couldn't we open that window for five minutes?
I like the smell of glue. It smells like fish. It brings back memories.
What do you think of the new guy?
Are you deaf or something?
He's skinny.
Still thinking of her, huh?
Apparently she's hearing voices now.
Would it be too much of an effort to put that a bit closer?
Hello.
Ma'am...
She's deaf as a post. This way we always know where she is.
Granny, go back upstairs to your room. There's nothing left. Now go.
You finished? Then don't hang around.
Fix the bulb on the 2nd floor.
- Hi, butcher.
- Hi, postman.
- Got a parcel for your daughter.
- Upstairs.
- Watch the step.
- Mind your business.
Grab it, Marcel.
- I've got it.
- Throw it over here. Throw it.
You shit.
Postal Administration. Article 12.
You've got exactly 20 seconds to get back to your flats.
- Move.
- You don't have kids to feed.
That applies to kids as well.
Can't you read, moron?
- "Julie Clapet."
- He's a friend.
A friend?
Here, Julie.
Sign here, Julie.
I call you Julie because I like you.
But I don't want to rush you.
See you, Julie.
- Here. For the ad.
- Always at your service.
- That new guy is kind of weird.
- He used to be a circus man.
I'm sure this contains some tidbits to eat. That's why they're...
- Would you like to taste them?
- Yes. I'd love to.
Shall we say at 7? That'll give me time to get things ready.
- Is he after her?
- After who?
Your daughter. She's a cute slip of a thing. She needs someone.
- That someone is me. Is that clear?
- Hey, I've got news.
They shot one down two days ago.
A superb 30-metre target.
- No bodies?
- They cart them away.
Bloody vermin.
They even say they eat money.
We've got to get rid of them for good, those vegetable-eating queers.
They'll get what's coming to them.
THE ENEMY PLOTS AGAINST US
- Bye, butcher.
- Bye, postman.
- Do you think that's it for tonight?
- I hope so.
That goddamn butcher,
I'm sure he won't do it tonight.
He's taking his time just to make me mad.
- He's obviously succeeded.
- What's he waiting for anyway?
Till the new guy tries to escape in a garbage can, too?
- How long did the other guy last us?
- A week.
Not counting the broth, that is.
One week. We polished off the last chunk two days ago.
I'm hungry. I'm bloody starving.
I'm fucking starving.
My little Hercule... Every man for himself, and God for all.
- Hi there. It's me.
- Hello.
Come in.
Please, do come in.
- For you.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
- Did you paint that?
- Yes, it's nothing much.
- No, no...
- No problem.
I've made a pot of tea.
- Shall I pour you a cup?
- Yes, please.
- I hope you don't find me too bold.
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- Why should I?
- A girl invites you to her flat.
Some would consider that a bit brazen.
- Well, actually...
- And thank you for this morning.
- Why thank you?
- You rescued my parcel on the steps.
I was very moved by your concern.
That goes without saying.
No, on the contrary. People usually only think of themselves nowadays.
Only because they have nothing.
Deep down, they're still good people.
I'm glad to hear they like me.
They're very kind.
I'm getting along with your father, too. He thinks I'm a nice guy, right?
- Why not try Kraft cheese spread?
- That's new.
- And handy.
- They talk to me about you.
- Who?
- The voices in my head.
Oh, right. The voices.
And what do they say?
Hold on, let me try to remember...
- It's more the language they use.
- Do they talk about love?
Oh, no.
"Robert's a pervert, an arse wipe, a panty eater." You see?
But that's not true.
Aurore, you're missing something really funny.
At any rate, I have no choice.
Here. Tomorrow at 11 sharp.
- Ring me. I'm counting on you.
- But...
"Arse wipe"?
Move out? What for?
I've just moved in.
Because it's pretty awful here.
The building is unsanitary.
The walls are falling apart, and it leaks.
- Perhaps you don't like me?
- Me?
- You act as if you want me to leave.
- No, on the contrary. Not at all...
It does that once in a while.
Did I hurt you?
- I'll be all right.
- Then it must be the shock.
I'm such a klutz.
Don't move.
I'm blind as a bat.
Everything's all foggy.
I could get lost in that fog.
Leave it. I buy two of everything because I break things.
- So you play the cello?
- Yes.
I play an instrument as well.
Will you wait for me?
- Oh, shit. Not again.
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to draw a bath.
- Again?
Well, you sharpen your knives often enough, too.
A musical saw...
- It has a nice sound.
- Sit down.
- The doctor and I had an act once.
- Doctor?
Livingstone. "Dr Livingstone".
He was my partner.
- But now he's gone.
- Where did he go?
He disappeared after a show.
We only found his remains.
They'd eaten him.
Can you imagine that? They ate him.
I lost everything that night.
So, the first ad I ran across...
- And here I am.
- I need to tell you something.
Listen.
Do you know that tune?
It was his favourite.
Have you noticed how clear the nights have been?
That's normal. We're entering the Virgo age. That's my sign.
- No kidding?
- I swear it. My ascendant is Leo.
Cut it out. Not everyone's Gorilla, ascendant Bulldozer.
I'm in luck, there's more in store.
"Get ready, the wind's shifting."
You'd like to pack up and leave, right?
You wouldn't get far. It's worse out there, they draw straws.
And it'd be a shame to lose these juicy hams. These little sucklings...
Stop joking around. I don't like it.
You're better off here.
At least we have a system.
My ass! Your helpers are drawing straws, too. What about that ad?
That's fate.
You can't change fate.
It's like you said: the wind is shifting.
Everyone's going to get it.
Mr Louison,
I shouldn't tell you this, but ..
What happened to your friend... the same thing goes on here.
It takes place at night in the stairwell.
That's why no one ever goes out.
And my father...
SOPORIFIC HERBAL TEA
Hi. I'm here to fix the box springs.
Come in.
This is an antique.
It's seen a lot of use.
- Yes.
- What seems to be the problem?
It squeaks. I find it bothersome.
Could you bounce around on it a bit?
Just so I can hear?
- I can't see what's wrong.
- It squeaks most when there are two.
Let's give it a try.
Just as I thought, it's the 2nd spring to the right.
Come, Aurore...
We are here, Aurore... to help you.
Come...
Freed from life... come with us, Aurore.
Tranquil and at peace...
Aurore, come...
COME AT 11 SHARP.
RING HARD.
Rotten world ...
That should do it.
- Here.
- Thanks.
- What are "Troglodists"?
- Outlaws.
- But no one ever sees them.
- Just tales to distract the people.
- A typical Capricorn attitude.
- Wrong. I'm Aquarius.
- Oh?
- A sign of the future.
Oh, the future...
It soon becomes history around here.
- It's very easy to miss a step.
- Don't worry about me.
You brats, give that back this instant.
RÃ©mi, stop sniggering or I'll give you a whacking.
I'll beat the one with the other, do you hear? Give that back.
Oh, great! How will we get that back now, you guttersnipes?
This is a job for the Australian.
The Australian?
The Australian.
Stand back.
That's quite a tool.
The Australian is nothing without its master.
Wow, did you see that?
- Tapioca, did you find a job yet?
- No. Nothing yet.
Bad news. You're running up quite a bill. Not to mention the rent.
I'm in a fix at the moment. But I've got something here. Want a look?
Black market? In these times?
You make me sick.
Just take a look.
A rat-call. The female cry.
It attract males.
So? There aren't any rats left.
What's that?
- This? A bullshit detector.
- Oh, yeah?
- Come on, give it a try.
- Give what a try?
Start bullshitting. Come on.
- Come on...
- I can't do it on command.
Life is wonderful.
Your bullshit detector is shit.
Turn that thing off. It's too loud.
If you don't settle your bill soon, you'll find yourself on my hook.
Very funny. What about that clown?
Isn't that taking a tad too long?
- Everyone in the building is edgy.
- Not before he's redone the ceiling.
And in the meantime, to hell with us, right? I've got mouths to feed.
- Yeah, the granny's, for instance.
- For instance... Why bring her up?
- I've got my reasons.
- What do you mean by that?
Want to pay up?
Give me the granny tonight.
She's one of us.
It's against the rules.
The rules, the rules...
The age limit is a rule, too.
- She's only good for pÃ¢tÃ©.
- She's my mother-in-law.
- Why not take Mrs Interligator?
- Stop yelling.
- It'd be an act of charity.
- Please.
Interligator is fond of his wife.
He's a good tenant. He pays.
The bloody rich.
They always manage.
You haven't got much choice in view of your debts.
Oh, it's you, Julie.
- You gave me a fright.
- Counting your money again?
Well, yes. Tell me...
You don't come to see me very often.
It's nice of you to come.
- Well, did you like your gift?
- It must have cost you a bundle.
Well, yes.
Anything to make you happy.
- You've loved sweets since you...
- But I don't any more.
- Let him go.
- You always ask the same thing.
- It's the same old story every time.
- No, this time...
This time it's different? True. Just look at you. I know what he's up to.
With his puppy eyes. Making your head spin with his dreams...
- There's no room for dreams.
- Stop that.
It's a tough world out there.
I didn't make the world.
I know you hate my trade, but it's an art like any other.
- Let him leave this place.
- With you? You won't last two weeks.
- I don't want to lose you.
- You lost me long ago.
Julie...
TROGLODISM: AN UNDERGROUND
ORGANISATION?
Good evening, old girl. Guess what?
Let's play a little game, OK?
I'll scare you, and you'll scream.
That little clown upstairs will rush to your rescue.
Let's begin, OK?
Go for it!
Planning to take my picture or what?
Scream, goddamn it.
You came from the N.E. sector to annoy us with your beau's troubles?
- Mr Louison.
- I don't know him. No names. No I.D.
- We're at war, girlie.
- We're outlaws. He's Rolls.
- Voltange.
- Rolan. Tourneur. Milan.
- Trap.
- Pank. Fox. Paumeau.
- We watch out for moles.
- You could be one.
- I'm not a liar. It's the truth.
- You, a surfacer? Talk about truth?
Do you know what this is?
Take a close look.
- Your brother Matt's shirt.
- Shot down like a rabbit.
- Now that's the truth.
- Common game. That's all we are.
- And you're predators.
- Not me. I swear.
- You're one of them. A carnivore.
- What?
Is that the way you rats treat ladies?
- Hey, watch it!
- For God's sake!
Oh, my God.
Tell Calamity Jane to smarten up, or all hell will break loose.
- Got it.
- A month's harvest is on the floor.
- Plus the risks.
- Matt died for that.
Right. Tell her.
Corn...
There's plenty more in my building.
30 large bags in my dad's cellar.
- What's this guy of yours look like?
- Louison, Rolls...
Yeah, the guy you want us to pick up.
- Can I help you, miss?
- No, just an old coffee grinder.
Coffee? Some people have it made.
So you went for a walk last night?
A long one at that.
First ruckus, then screams.
This building is a madhouse.
Your father may work at night, but this is going too far.
There you are, Julie.
You OK?
Sorry, I was just rehearsing a new number.
Hold on...
Here.
Didn't you hear anything last night?
No, your tea made sure ofthat.
A pot of tea a night, just as you prescribed.
I'll get you some more, you're almost all out.
You should drink some, too.
You look exhausted.
- Cheer up, she died a natural death.
- Come on, let's go.
But still, I'd have liked to say goodbye.
Why don't we do that right now?
Poor Robert.
What made you rush out into the stairwell at night anyway?
I did it for Aurore.
I wanted to save her.
I'm telling you, she wasn't the one who screamed.
Anyway, here you go.
Still, I did it for her.
The butcher was very decent.
He apologised.
Invite you to dinner?
I haven't got much.
That's fine. That way we won't feel weighed down.
- At 9 p.m.?
- Sharp. I'm always on time.
- Rather unusual for a girl, right?
- For a girl, you're rather unusual.
I owe you a lot, you know?
- Did you forgive them...
- For Livingstone?
- One must always forgive.
- Depends. It's not always possible.
Don't say that.
No one is completely evil.
It depends on circumstance. Or they don't realise they've done wrong.
36th sector, 5th division.
Squirmer's Avenue.
What did that girl say? The girl!
Sector 3/4, 69Â° north-east.
Albumin Square. Here.
All right, let's go.
Scout to Sauce Master. Heading towards target, 69Â° north-east.
Sauce Master to Scout.
Read you, over and out.
Watch your backsides, guys!
Come, Aurore...
They are the worm... you are the fruit.
Not again! Darn it!
It seems rather quiet.
Not Father's golf clubs.
Yes, Father's clubs...
- Know who's on TV tonight?
- I don't have a TV.
Look, isn't that your customer?
- Shit.
- I'm a bit pressed for time.
No offence, but would you permit me to come back later tonight... to pay my respects to your daughter?
- Danger, we know not.
- Audacious, that's us.
Courageous, give me three.
Generous, you, you, you and me.
Scout to Sauce Master.
Corn located at site.
I repeat: corn located at site.
Proceeding with reconnaissance mission. Target: Louison.
I repeat: target, Louison.
An ambush.
- Aurore, what's the matter now?
- Georges...
Throw in your apron?
Now I've heard it all.
I've been thinking about it for a while now. I'm getting older.
I'm losing my touch.
And so many victims...
- I feel sorry for them.
- Sorry? That's not like you.
No one's entirely evil.
It's circumstance.
Or they don't realise they've done wrong.
Some say you have to be able to forgive. Do you forgive me?
An old bastard like you?
- Maybe I could.
- You're sweet.
The guys you finished off wouldn't forgive you, though.
- You'd really have to insist on it.
- If only Julie could forgive me.
- Have you asked her?
- She wouldn't ever.
- But you're her father.
- She won't even speak to me.
Want me to go see her?
I could explain it all to her.
All she cares about is that Louison.
But then, he's not such a bad guy.
By the way, he's on TV tonight.
Why don't you go tell him?
I bet he doesn't know.
He has his head in the clouds.
- You should really eat something.
- Not hungry.
Not hungry.
Fox...
You've been hiding things.
You're on TV tonight.
What do you know about that!
Livingstone.
The Criekville Casino.
Our Tica Tica Walk was a big hit back then.
Tica Tica what?
Oh, shit.
- So that's your new number?
- I can explain, Julie.
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
I messed things up again.
- He's got clown shoes.
- Mission accomplished.
We'll wait for the others.
Julie?
Recipe 8: Cordon Bleu to Sniper.
Artichoke Heart SoufflÃ©.
- Quiet down.
- Artichoke Heart SoufflÃ©.
Preparation: H minus 35 minutes.
Then the onions. Simmer the snipers.
Cover them for about 15 minutes.
I repeat: for about 15 minutes.
H minus 20 minutes: stir the sauce.
I repeat: H minus 20 minutes.
THE STARS OF THE CIRCUS
Julie, I didn't think you'd come.
- Good evening...
- I'll have a cup of tea.
- Pardon?
- I'll have a cup of tea.
A cup of tea?
You have...
I'll have one as well.
Yes, a nice cup of tea.
Aurore, come and watch.
It's spellbinding.
Come, Aurore...
Come...
- You're wearing...
- I found some contact lenses.
...they'll titillate us.
Here's Stan and Livingstone.
- You never told me about this.
- Julie... that's Livingstone.
Livingstone, Julie.
- I don't believe this.
- It's the antenna, Dad.
- What a drag.
- It's the antenna.
- Go and fix the wire.
- In this storm? No way.
That bastard.
It's the antenna.
Because of the wind.
Louison.
Aurore... come...
It's so much better here, near us...
Come...
Louison...
- What?
- Come back.
I can't hear you.
Come back.
Go back inside, Julie.
Watch out.
Mr Louison?
No...
To the right.
A bit more.
Yes. OK. Perfect. Perfect!
Leave it the way is. Perfect.
Georges...
Aurore?
- No more Robert...
- I fell.
That pervert who just wants to drag you down into the mire... down into the sewer, into the sew...
- So it was you all along.
- No.
Since when have you been doing this?
- No, I can explain.
- You bastard.
It comes from downstairs.
You'll hurt your leg, Robert.
Stop.
Help, help!
You shit. Son of a bitch.
- I fell.
- Yes, Aurore.
I wanted to get up on the chair.
I fell.
Yes, Aurore.
The Troglos. The Troglos are kidnapping someone.
Les Troglos...
How nice of you to make coffee,
Julie. Expecting company?
Take your clothes off.
- Julie, hurry.
- That Interligator woman... blew herself up sky high.
Took her husband with her.
Where are you going?
Stop them, Robert.
Julie, what are you doing here?
Wipe that muck off your face.
Do you hear me? Go home this instant.
And wipe off that lipstick.
And you, I'll skin you alive.
Just you wait. I'll get you yet.
I'll get you.
Just you wait.
- Who goes there?
- Snipers.
How did it go? Everything all right?
Everybody OK?
Hey, Tourneur, look what I found.
- Yes, but how about the others?
- Here they are.
- How did it go?
- Easy. Virtually fell into our arms.
And we're all here.
Shit.
- Where did she come from?
- What the hell...
- Shit.
- Pank...
Is that the guy we were supposed to grab? The target you located?
- Pank, can you explain this to us?
- Wasn't that the plan?
"Albumin Square. Name: Louison."
That's what it says.
But it also says: "Sex: male.
Shoes: that of a clown's."
- Then we'd better check it out.
- Sex: male. Male!
- So? What of it?
- OK, so tell me, is the sex male?
Not my problem.
Our mission was Louison. You got it.
Louison...is the package here male?
Yes or no?
I guess we should check it out.
Sorry, Louison, just part of the job.
I must have landed in a loony bin.
I'm sick and tired of this bullshit.
There's been a mistake, so let me go.
See, guys?
Female through and through.
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.
Artichoke Heart here.
I repeat: Artichoke Heart.
In immediate danger.
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.
- Artichoke Heart is in danger.
- We'll knock them off like flies.
- Must be cooking up there.
- You can count on those weirdos.
- They'll fix your buddy for good.
- Should we go?
Of course you're going. All of you.
- Doesn't she ever shut up?
- They play rough.
But an agreement is an agreement.
Who's not in? Rap, you're coming with me. Milan, Fox, Tourneur...
- You take the others. Move it.
- But what about me?
What about me?
Don't forget about me. What about me?
You assholes.
In case I don't come back.
Open up.
Give it up, you dimwit.
We'll let you go. I swear.
We won't touch you.
We'll forget the whole thing, OK?
- My cleavers. All of them.
- Right, the cleavers. Kill them off.
- Think you're on a safari, bitch?
- That's my wife.
- No men or women, only volunteers.
- You got it. Obedient volunteers.
Harm one hair of my daughter's head, and I'll carve you up into pieces.
- So, go get my cleavers. Move it.
- On the double.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I don't like this one bit.
It won't be long now.
Julie, get out of here.
Yes. It's me they're after.
Don't cry. I'll be all right.
- Don't cry.
- It's my contacts.
What?
Julie, there's only one thing left to do.
Go on, push. Push.
- What are you doing? Move your butt.
- Can't. I've gained too much weight.
Wait, turn back. Tourneur, wait.
- Shit, Tourneur's been hit.
- Tourneur's been hit.
- Hey, postman. Everything OK?
- I got one. Come and see.
- These monsters are everywhere.
- They've lost one.
They won't be back.
Good ol' Tourneur. Hang in there.
That lead really weighs you down.
- No other damage?
- Don't worry. We'll get you out.
You all right?
Come on, push.
Let me through.
- I don't believe this.
- Water's running.
What the hell are they doing?
Stand back.
What the hell are they up to?
Marcel...
You OK, Marcel?
Come on, get up. Get up.
Go on! Go! Go!
Julie, follow me.
Be careful!
Not a minute too soon.
Miss Plusse, you're a dragonfly in mating season. So a toad like me...
Get lost, jerk. I'm in a rush.
Let the lady by, will you?
I go from one footbath to another. Shit.
I despise you. I hate you.
This time you're done for, clown.
- Cut the bullshit.
- Right. Cut the bullshit.
Now you're going to start singing.
My cleaver, damn it. Hand it over.
- Here, butcher.
- You, here?
This is a job for the Australian.
At any rate, you came at the right time.
No...
- Oh, my God...
- Goddamn Troglos.
Bastards. My Julie...
It's all your fault.
You'll pay for this.
I've got something stuck in my head, right?
Answer me, sausage head.
You, tell me. I'm not dreaming, am I?
I've got something stuck...

{126051}{}What's happend?
In the year of Our Lord 1,123,
King Louis vl, known as "The Fat", waged war against his cousin,
Henry l, King of England and Duke of Normandy.
Many brave knights fought beside him.
They believed in God and the forces of Evil.
Your Majesty, time is of the essence.
Need I remind you we are in their camp? silence, Montmirail.
Love knows not haste! sire Godefroy!
The English!
My vassal sees horsemen approaching.
We are coming.
I beg of you, Your Majesty, make haste!
Adieu, my sweet.
I must join my men.
Will I see you soon?
When my cousin, the King of England, makes amends.
Do you love me, Kathleen?
Then accord me one last favor, should I die.
- Hush hush...
- show me your ankles.
I beseech thee, lady-love.
Higher. Up to your knees.
My God! How beautiful! sire... they're coming.
Come, sire.
THE vIsITORs
This way.
King! I capture thee!
Let me, my King!
Liar!
The King is never captured.
Not even in chess.
Toil! Never recoil! sound the horns! The King!
Master! You're alive!
God be praised!
I managed to save your horse and your arms.
You managed to flee, as usual.
Castrated clod! sire Godefroy,
The King summons you.
Castrated clod! sires... the King!
My kind knight Godefroy merits indeed his name "The Hardy".
His baldrick was nary stuckolded.
With his sword, he yslaked a scurvy English head.
Godefroy Amaury de Malfete,
Count of Montmirail, of Apremont, and of Popincourt
I shall thus reward your valor. sire, I am your eternal servant.
I know you desire descendants.
You have one week to fetch one of the fairest
Wenches in the Kingdom: the daughter of the Duke of Puglia.
I know you adore her. she is yours to wed.
How can I thank thee?
To serve my King is my Honor.
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
- Who is he?
- Jacquasse the Crass.
My vassal.
He should be waiting outside.
He lacks grace, but he sniffs out a trail like a good hound.
We must avoid the Forest of Malcombe, and pass by Montargis.
Avoid the forest?
You know it's haunted, sire.
No one dares penetrate it.
Hogwash!
My betrothed must not wait!
What about the witch of Malcombe?
Ride ahead of The Crass. she can turn an army into frog vomit.
At her touch, your skin spits pus. and you pisseth mud. she can damn 7 generations.
We're doomed!
Doomed!
Per Ansia
Queribus Memorium
"Halt or becometh a slug."
It's Latin and visigoth.
The Devil's drool!
A Black sabbath.
Let's splitteth!
What does she want?
To make that old hag young again. It's impossible!
Drink! Drink!
Where is she?
Fear not. she'll drop back in.
What a blast to have a virgin's unpolluted body again! she's plug-ugly!
Just like the day I married her!
It's devildom! surrender, she-Devil!
We'll dismember her and slice out her tongue.
Let rats gnaw on her innards.
No lady is tortured on my lands.
Just burn her.
Thank you, sire.
Thank you. You are too good!
At last... my castle.
Unpack our best apparels to honor my beloved.
Jacquasse, help me change.
Yes, sire.
I have no fine apparels. she won't even see you.
My shoes and my fanciest shell.
Ganelon, sound the horn to announce my arrival.
How thrilled am l, sire Fulbert, that my son weddeth your sweet and gentle daughter.
I wanted her to weddeth a Duke, but our Fat King decided otherwise.
Cursed be love.
More wine!
Let me piss a-plenty!
Father, you promised nary to burp for my marriage.
The Count of Montmirail!
Frenegonde! where are you going?
Frenegonde! Come back!
Come back this instant!
Frenegonde! Come back!
No Duke's daughter runs after a mere Count.
You look good and gentle.
And mighty uncomfortable.
Why?
Zounds!
The flask falleth all alone.
Give it to me.
My thirst needs a-quenching!
The castle!
Holy scrotums!
It swelleth like a blowfish!
It's wearing a wig! sire Godefroy, are you not well?
By what devil-craft?
What's wrong?
Come back, you wicked wench!
Come back!
Come back, you foul slut!
God shield!
A bear is chasing her!
My crossbow!
Come back!
There's no bear. steer clear, beloved! steer clear!
Father!
I saw a huge beast.
I'll spend my life in a convent, faithful to you.
I can ne'er wed the man who killed my father.
I understand, my betrothed.
I'll be faithful too.
I shall ne'er marry... ne'er have descendants.
Don't do me any favors.
What are you up to?
I Was praying for his saIvation.
Where is my father's wizard?
Eusaebius?
I found him.
He lives yonder, not far from here.
But they say he's senile.
I can make your Duke live again.
But you must know no fear.
Only God can do that!
You are right.
Only God can bring back the dead.
But there is another way.
Time is a mountain, pierced by many hidden tunnels.
My magic spells can give you access to them.
Meet Angueran. scarface Angueran.
At your service.
And my loyal Ganelon.
You shall return just before the Duke's death.
If you find enough force in yourself... you will be able to change the course of the arrow.
You'll wed your betrothed, and have the lineage you desire.
It's sheer lunacy!
Where is my powder of leech?
I haven't done this in ages.
I'm a bit rusty.
He's senile!
Here it is.
If you fear not,
Godefroy the Hardy, drink.
You'll arrive in the forest just before the accident.
Don't trust the old fool!
If sire Godefroy doesn't return,
We'll lock you in his dungeon
With your Book of spells.
Trust me.
Don't drink it, sire.
You'll turn into a frog, or a bat, or a goat, or a nun's ass.
Perhaps you're right.
Drink first.
Me?
I'll see if you turn into a nun's ass.
If you do, I'll seek revenge.
Drink! so, my Crass?
It tastes like pig excrement.
Candied concoctions are for evil sorcerers.
Drink hastily.
I must say the incantation.
If I drank... am I going too? say the incantation.
They've gone into the Tunnels of Time!
What's that noise?
What did you step on?
Rotten eggs.
I forgot the quail eggs.
What a catastrophe! stand up, peasant.
Where are We?
And our friends?
This isn't my Forest.
The wizard misled us!
We have tWo legs, sire.
And tWo arms.
'Tis miracle enough.
Fetch me a horse.
Make haste!
Pugh! It stinketh!
He's crazy! sire! A Moor!
A Moor in the Devil's chariot!
'Tis metal,
With no oxen to pull it! sire, come see!
Thither, sire! Thither!
They're psychos.
They're psychos.
Psychos!
Whose shield is this?
Lord our Father, We have sinned.
We'll bear this ordeal to the end.
Give us the courage never to recoil.
We Will obey Thee.
Amen.
It stinketh.
We can't breathe! We're doomed!
No, I smell victuals.
More diabolic chariots!
Let's stay in the Forest.
No!
We can't fight on an empty belly.
Two burgers!
French fries and ketchup!
Yo guys!
Is it Halloween?
You're dressed to go trick or treating! silence, strumpet.
Take this and go your way.
Leave us be.
Holy Moses!
Are you Tv stars? shove off! shove off!
I don't want to impose,
Ladies and Gents, but since you're in show-biz, do you know any... big-time agents?
Quiet, peasant, or I'll smacketh you.
It just so happens
I studied song and dance.
If you could get me an audition, it'd change my life.
What's wrong?
I'm no Worse than Madonna!
Let us leave this vile baWd.
Listen... still hanging around, sticky fingers?
Give back the steaks!
Watch out!
I'm a political refugee!
I'm sick of your shenanigans!
Ho! lnnkeeper!
You hit the fairer sex?
What the hell do these two clowns want?
This isn't a hobo hideout!
I am Godefroy of Montmirail,
Count of Apremont and of Popincourt.
And I lord over my property.
Mr. vautrot! Help!
Call the cops!
The bag lady's bothering Roger again!
Murderer!
Come on, toots!
This guy is gun crazy!
Attack, sire!
On your knees, punk!
Montjoie! st. Denis!
Jacquasse! My Jacquasse!
Easy does it, hot stuff.
Attack!
Montjoie!
Montjoie!
Asylum!
Asylum!
Father, I beseech the right to asylum.
Mi... Mi, honey.
That's it.
Keep on practicing, love.
I'll be right back.
Hello, Countess? It's Father Herve.
Hello, Father.
Yes, well...
My mass was interrupted... by a hooligan dressed in a very peculiar way.
He claims to be the Count of Montmirail etc, etc...
Quite frankly, he seems off his rocker.
The Count of Montmirail?
Daddy died in '81 .
I know, Beatrice. I buried him. This one claims to be called "The Hardy".
He has your family arms on his tunic.
Godefroy the Hardy?
How absurd.
Come quickly.
He looks ornery.
Hello? Hello?...
Father Herve?
What is this?
It's the UNICEF calendar.
Hurry!
He's busy praying. He saw today's date and went into a state of shock.
He claims to be born in 1 076.
He's a crackpot.
My betrothed.
My betrothed.
You are here?
Frenegonde!
My beautiful Frenegonde! stop!
That totally hurts!
Calm down, you brute!
It is l. stop. I don't know you.
Frenegonde.
The Countess doesn't know you.
You've made a mistake.
Cease, Father.
Dare I understand?
This fair dame is not my beloved, but my descendant.
1 000 years betwixt us.
Yes. I have to go.
I don't know him from Adam.
I'm from the time of Louis vl.
Help me. shall I call for help?
No, this very nice man
Won't harm us.
Will 50 francs do?
I must return to my time.
Know'st thou a wizard?
No. sorry, no wizard.
I know the wizard of Oz.
Where is this "Oz"?
Don't budge.
We'll take care of you.
Thank you, my sweet.
It's a miracle.
Okay, call the police.
- It's not very Christian.
- Of course it is.
Pugh! How ugly!
Without them,
We couldn't Watch Tv. Here...
Just what the doc ordered.
Thanks, bawd. You're ugly as sin, but good-hearted.
Ever see your nose?
When you sneeze, is it typhoon season?
Your wine is fruity, but a tad watery.
The wine's mine, swine.
What a raunchy eater!
You eat the plastic too?
The wizard was senile.
If I catch him,
I'll skin him alive.
Don't take it so bad.
Those pigs aIways get us.
Is your buddy a wrestler?
I saw him on Tv.
I wanted to be a singer... but they're all full of shit in show-biz.
My sire is a warrior, a trusted aide of our King.
The Count of Montmirail.
Montmirail?
The dentist's old lady?
He couldn't marry her!
That's why we're here.
They're not married?
No kidding!
The nerve of that prude! she acts so holier-than-thou at the rummage sale.
What a bitch!
You came so fast. squadron sergeant-Major Gibon.
At your service, Countess.
I brought the National Guard.
Where's the offender?
My stars!
Your squadron is quite impressive.
He's a bit brutal, but he's just a poor homeless person.
They're back-up.
This is Doctor Bauvin.
First we'll talk to him. size up the beast.
Let's go, Bauvin.
Good luck!
Where is she?
Enough! ldentity papers! Green card!
Psychology, sergeant-Major.
Hello there.
Are you from around here?
Bow down before me, and I shall be clement.
Why the costume?
Are you an actor?
Is this for Tv?
Candid Camera? should I smile?
Where is my descendant?
Answer or die!
Let me, sergeant-Major.
He's a sicko!
A little shot and you'll be good as new.
Give me your arm.
Officer, send in your men on the double!
He's a maniac!
He took the doctor hostage!
Thanks for coming!
Montjoie! st. Denis!
Toil, toil! Never recoil!
I have a horrible doubt. This tramp just may be part of my family.
What?
"Montjoie" is the battle cry of French knights.
"Toil! Never recoil!" is the motto of Godefroy the Hardy.
It's my family's motto.
Now you have doubts?
He's calmed doWn.
Hold him down.
I'll put him to sleep.
No, my mistake!
I never saw him before.
It can't hurt.
I killed the nerve.
Jean-Pierre, come here.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'll just be a minute.
Do you remember my cousin Hubert?
Martha's son. Naval Academy.
The race car driver?
I never met him.
Obviously. He disappeared in Borneo before our marriage.
- I think he's alive.
- What?
As wacky as it sounds, today's Tarzan... is probably Hubert.
He's totally changed.
You said he was a bum.
He had family air.
The sensual nose, the large forehead...
You meet a derelict
With a shiny red schnozz, and noW... he's a long-lost sensual cousin!
A cousin with our arms!
Don't just stand there.
Come look.
Look. The Montmirail family album.
Here's our first Count,
Godefroy The Hardy.
It's the same nose and forehead.
That's a 900-year old drawing.
What's the link with Hubert?
I'll call the castle.
When Hubert was 1 9, he posed for the last family portrait.
A wild-goose chase!
Beatrice Goulard de Montmirail for Mr. Jacquart.
Hello, Countess. It's Frederick.
Fred, is Jacques-Henri there?
One minute. A word of warning: he's repairing the boiler.
He's on edge.
Jacques-Henri!
Why did you jerk the lever so violently?
You asked me to. spare me.
My stunning vest is now a filthy rag.
Jacques-Henri!
Why are you shouting?
Beatrice de Montmirail.
What a ball-buster.
Jacquart?
Jacquart?
Yes?
Boiler trouble?
The burner is ruined.
Jean-Francois yanked on the lever.
Oil spurt out.
I was nearly disfigured.
Not to mention my jacket.
No one is of any help.
At least no one died.
Thank God.
I have a problem too.
Can I ask you a favor?
Go upstairs to the Gallery.
In our last family portrait... there's a Royal Navy cadet. second row. The kepi with a feather.
Do you have a Pola?
A what?
A Polaroid, Jacques.
The children threw ours in the toilet.
We have no "Pola". And my name is Jacques-Henri, not Jacques.
Try to understand, Jacquart/ my cousin is in an insane asylum by accident.
I can't help your cousin.
We're busy.
The Bernay and Bernay Bank is here for a seminar.
Edgar Bernay will be bathing in cold water. so, even if I had a "Pola",
I wouldn't take your picture.
Okay, I'll hang up.
I'll deal with this myself.
Toodle-oo.
Good riddance. sir...
Yes.
The rooms are horribly humid.
Mr. Bernay is sneezing non-stop.
He wanted to relax after his speech on sponsoring. so he took a shower.
Ice-cold.
His head is full of shampoo.
If you can't get the hot water back,
We'll have to cut short the seminar.
Does the lnstamatic work?
I'm draining Mrs. Pelissier's molar.
It'll be fine.
This is the Montmirail's house.
Take it easy!
They'll bawI us out. stop!
They'll call the cops for noise pollution.
Try ringing the bell.
Knock it off!
They'll kick us out!
Jacquart,
Why are you dressed like that?
Excuse our excessive chiming, your Grace...
Lady Frenegonde!
Let me go! You're crazy! she's my mistress!
What?
Jean-Pierre, come here.
Jacquart is calling me
"Frenegonde" too.
You slept with her?
Don't worry.
He looks weird but he's pals
With Montmirail the stuntman.
Montmirail the stuntman?
You must mean Hubert, the race car driver. stuntman, wrestler... race car driver... same diff.
But who are you?
Jacquasse The Crass.
You don't recognizeth me?
No, I don't recognizeth you.
You're Hubert's friend?
Hubert de Montmirail, whatta hunk.
And so considerate...
Iike you, your Ladyship.
And he gallops like Kerwin Costnere.
Coward that I am,
I lost track of my sire at the inn.
They got in a brawI at Remi vautrot's pit stop.
Whip me... your Ladyship!
What is it?
- Jacquart?
- Thou know'st me?
What?
A Jacquart from hunger.
I'm lost.
Mr. Goulard...
Yes, hello...
He's a friend of Hubert's. According to her,
Hubert has become a stuntman and a wrestler.
What horrible teeth!
Let's have a look.
I'm no mule! Zounds!
That ass bit me!
I need a tetanus shot!
He might even have rabies!
It isn't Jacquart.
I did his bridge-work.
Obviously, Jean-Pierre.
He proves that Hubert is alive.
We have to get him out of the hospital.
You banged the Countess?
Bitch.
The bum can't come.
My car isn't Noah's ark.
Open the window.
His body odor is unbearable.
He's very, very green. stop the car.
He's going to vomit.
Wait a second!
Hold it in!
It's coming!
He got it all over.
What a pig!
He puked on my shoes!
Your cousin is very violent.
He nearly castrated me.
Castrated clod!
What?
He saved our King's life.
What?
Ah, my youngling.
Why did you abandon me?
Their little red balls made me sleep.
Master! Master!
Why are you bound?
How much is the ransom? silence, peasant!
The "Iittle red balls" are valium.
50 milligrams. He barely slept.
Apothecary, I demand to be released immediately.
Calm down.
I am neither sick nor loony.
I come from far, far away.
Yes.
He thinks no one understands who he is.
Persecution mania.
But it's true. He came from Borneo.
He had an accident during a rally.
Right, cousin Hubert?
Cousin Hubert?
Yes. Hubert de Montmirail.
It's freaky... he has my father's hands.
You know your name.
He knows nothing.
He's completely amnesiac.
He says he's never watched Tv.
Amnesiac? How tragic!
His last remaining memories are a few facts from History class.
Elementary stuff.
It's often the case with amnesiacs.
He speaks a hodgepodge of Latin and Old French. verbal diarrhea.
Let him go.
- Pawing at him won't help!
- Compose yourself.
Will you free him?
Yes, only because your husband is a doctor, and he agrees to take full responsibility.
Another relative of yours?
No, not at all.
An old friend of Hubert's.
I belong to the Count. souplette, sire?
Is he a foreigner?
I don't understand him.
Yes, that must be it.
Come, cousin...
Wait! lf you take him, take his outfit too.
It smells like a billy goat here.
It's repulsive.
Here, take the valium.
If he gets violent, give him five of them.
Thank you.
Two more lunatics roaming the streets. sit down here.
Take care of him. I'll get the car.
Lady Frenegonde is strange. she is not Lady Frenegonde. she's my descendant.
My great great great great great great granddaughter.
Your great great great great granddaughter?
How terrible!
My Crass, we're a 1 000 years old.
It's a living hell.
We must search the dungeon.
Angueran swore to lock up the wizard and his Book.
With the book, We can concoct the potion and go back in Time.
Drink that again? Pugh!
You'd rather stay here?
Oh no!
Is this too fast, Hubert?
Do you feel sick?
Open your eyes, sire Godefroy.
You'll get used to it.
Why "Godefroy" and not "Hubert"?
Jean-Pierre, he has amnesia.
Godefroy, Henri, suzy...
Wait. Who has amnesia?
Your cousin or that other skunk?
They both do, Jean-Pierre.
Try being more tolerant.
Their feet reek! It's revolting!
What an insufferable ride!
Please...
I didn't smell anything unusual.
Did the kids behave?
- Yes.
- Okay, toodle-oo!
Zounds! What happened to Nature?
Everything is ugly.
There's no room... to go hunting.
The air is heavy.
It stinketh!
I'll say!
And it'll be worse
With the new highway.
Good-bye, Dr. Goulard.
Here you go.
It smells gross. Yeeuck!
Like old socks.
Could be. see you tomorrow, Hilda.
Where is my castle?
We left the castle ages ago.
Unfortunately.
Can you imagine the heating bills?
Anyway, Hubert, make yourself at home here.
I must go to the castle.
Yes! Yes!
That'll be tomorrow's outing!
Count me out.
I'm over-booked already.
Dinnertime!
Yes! souplette! Good hot souplette!
Yes, Mr... Jacques Kass.
I'll make you some.
He loves soup.
You live in a pitiful dwelling.
'Tis for peasants.
True, our home is simple.
But it's cozy and has lent itself to some marvelous evenings.
Don't push it.
We weren't counting on having houseguests. so go easy on us, Hubert.
You're Cousin Hubert?
O! noble Cousin Hubert!
Now he's calling me Hubert!
They're both crazy!
Listen, peon.
I'm Cousin Hubert.
You, sire?
I don't want to go back to the loonies.
Call me "Cousin Hubert"... and never "sire". Understand?
Yes, sire. stop that, or I'll give you the little red balls.
Leg of lamb, my sire!
Why "my sire" now?
I don't know, Jean-Pierre.
I just don't know.
Mr... Kass, that's for tomorrow.
Tonight is cold roast beef and a salad... and a Cup-a-soup for you.
If you're still hungry, you can have some left-overs.
Then a shower and off to bed.
Maybe they can start with the shower.
After such a trying day... they'll want to wash up.
No servants?
Come wash your hands.
Bea, come look.
What is it?
Come look!
What?
Cousin Hubert, What are you doing?
Can amnesia be this serious?
They're boors! swimming in the toilet!
Water. soap.
Hot.
Cold. Okay?
Thank you, gentle Lady.
Gentle lady... sire Godefroy.
Cousin Hubert!
Lady Frenegonde is
1 000 years old too? she's not Lady Frenegonde. she's Lady Beatrice.
How often must I tell you?
Lady Beatrice.
The descendant.
Jean-Pierre, set the table.
The nice plates or the normal ones?
Jean-Pierre, use mother's service.
Ridiculous.
Here. Help me, you two.
You stupid idiots!
Bea, they're retarded!
They can't even set a table!
Hello!
Don't scream.
It's Jacquart. I'm not deaf.
I'm sorry, Jacques-Henri.
Bea has some family over.
It's not easy. sorry to bother you.
I'm here with President Bernay the younger of the two banking brothers.
A charming man.
Unfortunately, he has a festering abscess.
Due to the humidity in your hotel, or your "Royal Raspberry" sherbet.
His face is all bloated.
I'll see your friend Bernie tomorrow at 8:00.
It's Bernay, not Bernie.
Lady-love... your skin is as soft as a rose petal.
Hubert!
How exciting to touch you... to lay beside you.
Who does he want to lay?
Jean-Pierre, you're totally on time.
Let's clean up. what were you up to?
You're kissing cousins!
- Not at all!
- sorry!
He'll take him.
He's too bad off.
Hello?
What the shit? shit.
Hello, Jean-Pierre? ls that Jean-Pierre?
What the hell?
You were sweethearts.
Not at all. He was much older!
You won't admit you were flirting.
Jean-Pierre, control yourself!
What you're saying is totally offensive.
Is this my castle?
Yes it is.
Where's my watch-tower? My moat?
My draw-bridge?
Is my dungeon intact?
He doesn't even recognize your castle.
Hub, it was rebuilt after the Revolution.
The what?
Christ Almighty.
I must go in my dungeon.
Relax. You're hysterical, Hub.
We'll go tomorrow.
But the dungeon is a legend.
Father aIways thought one existed... but we never found it.
It's like someone imitating a dog.
Listen. It's strange.
I don't hear a thing.
President Bernay.
Now he's gone too far!
He better not have woken
Florian and Ondine.
No! Bea! He burnt your umbrell-Ahhhhh!
Umbrella.
In the hole.
These eardrops sting.
The dog never complained.
If President Bernay has lost... just one percent of his hearing,
We'll sue the pants off you.
I've gone deaf.
I'm a little confused...
You're a race car driver?
A boxer? A stuntman?
A movie actor?
Who's the star of the movie?
Do I know him? And the director? stop the interrogation.
You're exhausting them.
Can't we talk?
Am I boring you?
Ay, indeed.
Charming.
You see.
Will this last long?
Day...
Night...
Please, Mr. Kass, that's becoming rather grating.
Can't he join us?
It's embarrassing.
He ne'er eats amid nobility.
He is happy to munch our left-o'ers.
Here, boy.
Thank you, sire Hubert!
He's mashing potatoes into the rug!
Enough! Come sit here.
That would upset him, right Jacquasse?
You want to sit here?
No, sire Hubert.
In my house, we all eat together.
Nay! Nay!
Obey, peasant.
Your host insists.
It'll be cozier.
There.
My sweet and pretty youngling...
Yes, dear cousin?
If you live in this poor abode,
Who owns our castle?
Jacques-Henri Jacquart. He's... rather nouveau riche and a bit affected.
- His family farmed our land.
- A peasant owns our castle?
- A peasant!
- What peasant?
Please! Jean-Pierre is a peasant too.
And he's a good husband.
He's a peasant? Pugh!
I lost my appetite.
This is too much!
I feel like throwing up.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Now he's spitting on me.
Or didn't you notice?
Excuse the oaf.
He is saddened to hear that a peasant owns my castle.
But why?
My sweet, radiant youngling...
I shall right this horrible wrong.
Jacquart shall render the castle in exchange for crowns.
If he refuses,
I'll disembowel him.
We'll rip off his stalk
Like we did the Duke of York
We hacked him up
Amid his shrieks and howIs.
We hung him up... alongside his bloody boweIs.
Bring in the hens.
I'm starved.
Hang who?
Jacquart the Peasant.
Bring the roasted lamb... the sausage and the beans... the venison...
Let us feast to forget this injustice!
Bring in kidney beans and kidneys.
A piglet and a roasted goat.
Well-peppered white swans.
Your whets have given me appetite.
You just stuffed your faces!
What's this puddle?
The room is totally flooded!
What happened?
They didn't turn off the Water!
They're deranged!
They can't shut off the tap! send them to the nut house!
Jacquasse, spongeth!
Yes, sire!
Who is that?
Mr. Kass! Not with your poncho!
I'll get some rags.
What is it now? sorry to pop in, but
President Bernay can't cope.
God knows how,
When Edgar took the phone, a foghorn sounded in his ear.
I'm not an ENT.
But it aggravated his toothache.
Irts trrowwwing.
It's throbbing.
Open your mouth.
How repulsive!
Wait here.
I'm going to fix
Bernaise's tooth.
It's Bernay. Edgar Bernay.
His abscess is incredibly ugly.
We'll be in my office.
Come on, come on! Everyone join in.
Can raspberry sherbet cause this type of infection?
No idea.
Bad timing, Jacquart.
We're in the middle of a flood.
Did the sewer back up?
It smells god-awful.
Be totally careful not to knock the bucket over.
Empty the bucket and sponge hardily.
Ay! Take this rag.
He threw a filthy mop on my linen jacket!
Mr. Kass, be careful with
Mr. Jacquart's linen jacket.
Mr. Jacquart, meet my cousin
Hubert, long-considered dead.
My pleasure.
My jacket is stained now.
A Hartwood original.
You're a less-bloated look-alike of your ancestor,
Godefroy the Hardy.
I have his portrait in the castle.
Ay, 'tis l.
Do I have a pimple?
That nose... those slimy eyes.
You're The Crass's descendant.
The Crass? Please...
What a disgrace!
Here, boy. start a-mopping.
Mr. Kass...
Ieave Mr. Jacquart be.
It's not his flood.
- Mr. Who?
- Jacquasse.
What an ugly face!
Your Jacquart is a traitor.
His real name is Jacquasse.
I aIways knew Jacquart as Jacquart.
Unless he changed his name to be more chic.
Jacques-Henri, how long have you had the name "Jacquart"?
Why?
Because you're the spitting image of Mr. Kass... and your names are similar.
I have nothing in common with this gentleman.
Just look at him.
No relationship at all.
I can't find my pouch in this unholy mess.
Dr. Goulard is a genius.
The abscess is... Oh my! ... drained.
The President is back in form.
Mr. Jacquart, is this...
- your brother?
- He's not my brother!
I'm Jacquasse The Crass. sorry, but it's getting late.
I understand. Let's go.
Thank you.
One minute, jester.
Let's make a deal.
I'll buy back the castle.
Take this, peasant.
A down payment.
Jacquart, take care of this.
We'll be in the car.
I'm coming.
My castle is not for sale,
I own it, Count.
Old gold coins?
I have 5 chests full, and 1 0 of jewels.
This upstart peasant can't stop me from buying it.
He's got nerve!
This is a fucking democracy.
What's "fucking"?
Jacquart, you've gone overboard.
That was vulgar.
What nerve! I take care of your Mr. Barbie for a modest fee, and you humiliate our houseguest.
Apologize!
Who does the hygienist think she is? shameless liar! lf you're proud of your family,
Why change your name?
What is the heinous secret?
An ogre? A witch? A child-slayer?
Hands off, Nazi!
If he can't understand why
Jacquart sounds better than Jacquasse, he should see a shrink.
I don't get it.
You're Jacquart's brother?
His brother?
Were you serious about buying back the castle?
A gift for you, my youngling.
I'm tired.
That's right. Bedtime!
How about some herbal tea, Hub?
Amnesia...
Cousin Hubert.
The new sire of the castle is a Jacquasse?
My God, how can that be?
Peasants have become sires.
Let us pray.
Jacquasse!
Beatrice!
They're praying now!
Don't scream. Let them pray.
Mommy...
There are bums in the living room.
Now they've woken the kids.
The lineage!
Your brother is the Count of Montmirail's valet?
I have no brother!
Older or younger?
We're not brothers!
I'm an only son.
We don't have the same name!
He smells awful. still, it was smart to change your name.
I once had a friend named Francois Twat.
He changed it to watt.
It changed his life.
Jacquasse is just too much!
I'll say. sorry, my name is not
Jacques Asse, but Jacquart.
They're ugly.
They stink. Gross!
Cousin Hubert is not a burglar.
His friend is not a smelly witch.
Cousin Hubert and Mr. Kass, let the children see you.
Nighty night, kidlings.
Don't stand there!
You'll scare them to death!
You scared them, Jean-Pierre.
Come on.
Lather up well. Especially your feet. soap and bath salt.
Help yourself... please.
I'll leave you.
- What's wrong with our feet?
- I don't know.
Another peasant ruse, no doubt.
It boil'st.
The ointments.
Jacquasse, scrub me. strange brush.
It'll do fine.
How is it going?
I have finished my ablutions.
Your turn.
Nay, sire. I bathed last month in the river.
I said it's your turn.
It boil'st!
What are they up to?
Why the uproar?
My Jacquasse is a-scrubbing.
I'll dry off in the chimney corner.
The entire bottle!
6000 francs down the drain!
Don't pull the plug!
I shall miss thee, lady-love
WhiIst I fight in the Crusades
Leaving you behind, turtle-dove
Darkens my heart, 'fore I fight
I can't stand it any more.
Take a valium. sire,
Jacquart... Is he my great great grandson?
Yes, my Jacquasse.
Poor you. Let's sleep.
It's mushy like porridge.
What now?
Beatrice, tell me about the kingdom since Louis the Fat.
Now?
Are you kidding?
Jean-Pierre!
This is an evil book.
I like it not.
It's the encyclopedia.
It has everything.
Nothing on Godefroy de Montmirail,
When he saved our King, during the Battle of Monthlery?
Not a word.
Really?
But his courage is renown from Poitou to savoie.
Godefroy the Hardy,
Louis the Fat... no one cares.
Our most famous family member is Gonzague de Montmirail.
Born in 1 754. Remember?
No.
He fought the Revolution against the rich, so they'd share their land
With the peasants.
What?
He helped create the Republic with La Fayette.
But he wasn't rewarded for his courage.
Robespierre had him decapitated.
A fine man, this Robespierre.
Why do you say that?
Why is Mr. Kass spying on us?
What infamy, my Jacquasse.
Peasants no longer pay taxes.
No more tallage, nor tithers.
How unfair.
We must return home.
What's that on your finger?
It's my seal.
Your seal?
It's The Hardy Ring!
You stole it from the castle?
Call the police. Or Jacquart may think we're accomplices. spare me. I'll return the ring.
Jacquart will understand that Hubert is mentally ill.
Mentally ill.
Lock him up, if he's mentally ill!
Where is Mr. Kass?
Out there.
What ripe apples, fair Ginette!
Come on, no feelies, stud. see 'ya. My groupies are getting impatient.
Here I come, fans.
Come on, Mr. Kass.
Ladies and Gents... for the artiste.
Ladies and Gents...
This is incredible!
A minute ago it was gorgeous.
Now it's raining cats and dogs.
I am angered that you think me a bandit.
I never said "bandit".
Don't exaggerate.
This ring is mine. A siIversmith made it for me in Flanders.
It cost me 1 00 ducats.
That's impossible, Hub.
Father sold that ring with the castle.
It can't be here and there!
President Bernay cannot give his speech in that ruckus.
There's an old ring sizzling in a glass case.
An old ring sizzling in a case?
What next?
Look! How can we concentrate on the prospecting?
It's the Hardy Ring!
Don't just stand there!
Get a fire extinguisher!
Make way!
Open the case!
It's burning!
It's broken.
What an ass!
What an ass! I'm blind!
Hold this.
This is crazy!
It's pitch black outside!
This is unreal!
It's hailing now.
Cheer up, Hub.
We'll return the Hardy Ring.
All will be forgotten.
He's The Hardy!
Mr. Kass, sit back. Did you eat old goat cheese for breakfast? sorry to be blunt, but I can't open the window. stay back there, please.
The closer we get, the darker it gets.
It works. Easy as pie.
He's a stupid ass.
Go ahead.
This extinguisher
Wouldn't put out a match.
Get out of here, honey!
It's going to explode!
What now?
You have ants in your pants?
The ring is a-fire!
It's devil work!
It fell under the seat. stop the chariot, girl!
Help! Call the Fire Department.
Perfect timing, Jacquart. Hubert has the Hardy ring, God knows how.
He brought it back.
The Hardy ring is here!
It's on fire!
My seal's a-fire!
How can it be up there?
It's down here.
Leave me alone!
- 'Tis sizzling and boiling.
- 'Tis hissing!
What are you doing?
Did you see lightning?
Wait a sec.
My roof looks like a cauliflower.
The lightning!
My Range! Godammit!
What happened?
It's incredible. It's nice out again.
Just unbelievable.
Jacquasse, look how they changed our beautiful castle!
Windows galore! We're defenseless!
A godsend for the visigoths.
And the Huttes.
Pray the dungeon is intact.
This weather is amazing.
I don't give a damn.
My Range! Dammit!
A brand new car with all the extras!
Look! It's ruined!
It's completely ruined!
Jacquart!
There's no lightning rod?
That's unheard of!
The explosion almost maimed the President.
No one was hurt?
No, thank God.
Just a car.
Thank God?
Thanks a lot!
My limo?
No, not your limo.
My new Range.
Don't lie. I can see from here.
The hood is burnt.
It's not burnt. Not at all!
Not the roof!
The hood, you idiot!
I'm warning you: if it's burnt,
We'll see you in court!
No, it's okay.
It's okay! Look!
Okkk ayyy!
I'm rubbing it.
I'm polishing it! Look!
It's so clean I can see myself!
Look!
It's okkk ayyy.
What's so funny?
Come, Jacquasse.
Let us go to my chamber.
...that hissing ring!
Give me Claims Division.
What kind of ring?
A signet ring.
You mean the Hardy ring
Was in its case?
I don't know.
Impossible.
Where the hell...
Jacqueline, where are you taking these men?
To the Hardy suite.
Innkeeper,
We'll be here several nights.
You and your friend?
There's just one bed.
He'll sleep on a mat in the halIway.
Not here, he won't.
In the stable, then.
Pity, sire! Not the stable.
I prefer the forest!
There is no stable. so pay for the room or go to the forest.
You understand me, my boy.
You're a kind man.
Don't touch me.
I'm not a kind man.
I'm not your friend or your brother. so dream on!
You'd let your brother sleep outside?
He's not my brother!
I never saw him! so he can sleep
Where the hell he wants!
You're so obscene!
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm taking
President Bernay his tea.
What the hell do I care?
And their deposit?
No, l...
You can't stay.
It's very pricey.
The Count of Montmirail sleep'st at Montmirail.
Keep your rotten coins.
Outside, scuzzballs.
Relax, Jacques.
Put it on my visa.
If Hub feels at home here, it may jog his memory.
It's worth trying.
Whatever you say. If you want to pay top price, be my guest.
You want my picture?
Don't stand there. show them to their room.
This way, Beatrice. sparks are flying!
The boss is angry at his brother.
This is the Godefroy Hardy suite.
The 10th century chimney is... a vestige of the watch-tower.
Zounds! It's different!
Excuse me?
Leave us, wretch.
What?
The Book of spells.
Holy scrotums!
You look drunk as a skunk!
Is that me?
That's an old fool!
Who's this monster?
Gonzague de Montmirail.
The Count Who helped the peasants?
A foul creature.
Nay, a saintly man.
Come. what are you doing?
Jean-Pierre, don't scream.
I'm not screaming.
It's expensive, but it's for Hub.
Two rooms at 2600, plus the suite at 3600, comes to 6200 francs a day.
Breakfast included.
How much?
Why three rooms?
I can't leave him.
Ridiculous! so I took a third room.
You're staying?
Hurry. I have other things to do.
- Bea, you can't do this.
- Okay, toodle-oo.
The torches are rotten. sire, I'm scared.
What are you doing?
They called me a wretch and threw me out. Then I heard a noise.
Open this door immediately!
Hub!
Cousin Hubert!
Mr. Kass!
They lit a fire!
There's soot everywhere.
You'll pay the dry cleaner!
They're not here.
Jacqueline, did they leave?
No, sir. I swear.
Don't start blubbering.
That won't help.
His friend's room.
Where did you come from?
Hub, what happened to you?
I need a torch.
Why were you hiding in the chimney?
The Book of...
We were here. Just visiting. visiting.... You were visiting the chimney?
We wanted a fire. A soot ball was blocking the flue. so Jacquasse, climbed on my shoulder.
I started climbing up...
And we slipped.
Everything fell.
No need to explain, Hub.
At 6200 francs a night,
We can expect the chimney to be swept.
There was no soot ball!
There's nothing!
Come on.
Jacqueline, call the roofer.
Tell him I refuse to pay the bill.
Not if he leaves soot balls!
Hub, you've got some explaining to do.
I am not Cousin Hubert.
I am Godefroy The Hardy.
I was born in the year of our Lord 1 079.
I'm Jacquasse The Crass, his vassal.
I know not my date of birth.
You're Godefroy, he's Joan of Arc, and I'm the Queen of England. Okay?
Okkk ayyy!
This is the Hardy.
Despite a vague resemblance, he was a fat, hairy macho
Who must have had chronic halitosis... You know...
Okkk ayyy! what are you doing here?
I asked for a torch.
Make haste!
Hubert, stop telling tall tales.
And what, pray tell, is this?
Mere trickery?
Hub!
You knew where the dungeon was?
Maybe we'll find the Montmirail treasure.
It's pitch black.
I'll get my flashlight. stay put.
Yes?
The torches died.
Can I help you? what on earth happened here? who is responsible for this?
'Tis a piece o' rubbish!
You can say that again.
If your brother sees this, it won't be a picnic.
Cousin Hubert needs a torch.
A flashlight.
I'll get you one.
Okkk ayyy!
Halogen flashlights.
A total must.
Could someone serve me a scotch?
I need a drink before the other brother arrives to finish the seminar.
Edgar and Edouard together... aren't easy.
I'm waiting for sire's torch. sire?
Cousin Hubert.
Hubert de Montmirail is your cousin?
How amazing. so Jacquart is their cousin too?
Nay nay nay!
Aren't you Jacquart's brother?
No.
Your mother isn't his mother?
My mother was Gwendolyne. she was devoured by woIves, because my father, on his way to the tavern, fell in the icy lake due to his club foot.
How awful!
How freaky!
Freakkky!
If I understand correctly, you're Jacquart's half-brother.
Freakkky! Okkk ayyy!
Freakkky!
Freakkky!
Yes, it sure is freaky.
Jacquart is so secretive.
There's no shame in having a handicapped father.
Okkk ayyy! sorry for your father.
Thank you. why did that idiot mention my father? what are you doing in the garbage, you dirty thief?
Come here.
Let go of me, sleazeball.
I'm a Chernobyl victim. save it for the cops.
Lady Ginette!
Release her, peasant.
Lady Ginette is my friend.
- she is a friend of yours?
- Yes. she is good-hearted. she is welcome here.
As you like, sir.
Her head was in the garbage bin.
If you rummaged in garbage heaps, you'd have a nicer bow-tie.
People with money to burn dump lots of great stuff.
Like I found these great stockings. what a ripe apple!
You're letting them in? stow it. she's the boss's brother's broad.
They'll kick us out.
Fear not.
The castle belongs to my family.
No way!
I'll give you a tour.
Ladies and Gents.
That's the office.
Hold your tongue, wretch.
It is my youngling's office.
He is kindred. what the hell is this?
Jacqueline, what happened in the halIway?
It's your "youngling", sir.
Those garbage heaps fall apart if you sneeze. worry not. 'Tis my specialty.
It needs oil. who let you in?
It's private here.
I'm showing our castle to Lady Ginette.
This is my youngling.
Hi youngling. she scuzzed up the Persian rug.
The game's over.
Get out, or I'll call the cops.
But you're my youngling.
I love you.
Thy success makes me proud.
Let go, scum.
Freddy, get the dog.
Brutus?
There are guests here.
I don't care!
Calm thyself, youngling. we're kin.
Chill out.
Enough!
Freddy, let him loose.
You flubbed.
That's not the way out. we must find the chapel.
My treasure!
He'll bite off our family jewels!
The chapel! The chapel!
The ruined abbey! welcome, Mr. Bernay.
Long trip.
Holy smoke!
Holy Moses! You're loaded. what about the pooch?
Your purse. we'll trap him.
I know him not. surely one of our enemies.
My youngling!
Help!
Hold on, youngling.
- without you, I'd have died.
- Indeed.
Leeches. serpent tongues. Rotten fish.
All the old wizard's potions.
A book!
The treasure is near.
The Book of spells.
All is lost.
That just opened.
I'm a little scared.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I'll go first.
My youngling!
Hub! Give me some slack.
Hub, help me!
Is there a Book?
- My God!
- what is it?
There's a note.
Godefroy de Montmirail.
If you make it here, call immediately, during office hours, 68 77 79.
Ask for Mr. Ferdinand.
In here.
Not you. Only the man.
- wait.
- sorry, youngling.
I wanted...
Great.
Come closer.
Godefroy de Montmirail?
The first Count to bear that name?
Yes, 'tis l.
I've been waiting 30 years. who are you?
I am the descendant of the wizard Eusaebius.
I am charged to send you back in time, so you can save the life of Eusaebius, who is at this very moment... being horribly tortured.
I prepared the potion, following the recipe in my ancestor's Book of spells.
Leave that.
The potion is on the shelf.
The same ghastly odor.
My ancestor's diary mentions your companion.
- where is he?
- At the castle.
You must leave with him before midnight. Or else, you'll have to wait 33 years.
If you don't return to your past, another future will take form, in which you have no descendants, because you never married and fathered children. so? what was the big secret?
Let's return to the castle.
The chariot that arrested me. why the ambulance?
Ma'am, hurry. It's your husband.
Jean-Pierre?
He was furious that you had hung up on him.
Then the dog bit him.
Come this way.
Jean-Pierre, what happened?
Jacquart's dog bit me while I was paying the taxi.
Your husband is baring his ass to this woman. she's caressing his bun'lings. she's giving him a shot. OK?
Get him out.
I want my shot in peace.
Excuse me, doctor.
Excuse us.
Is this Grand Central station?
I should charge admission!
You're here.
Yes.
Did Brutus attack for no reason, or did you excite him first?
Excite who?
Excuse me.
The dentist hurt himself?
I'm sick of having my ass stared at.
Jean-Pierre, you're paranoid.
No one is staring.
I have a phone call for Cousin Hubert.
Godefroy?
Monijoie!
It's Jacquasse, Godefroy.
No use shouting at the little box. stop screaming! speak calmly into the little holes. where are you, peasant?
Bowling Alley. with Lady Ginette.
And I'm no longer a peasant.
Yo, Jacky.
I roll the ball.
I'm having a ball! we're having balls.
You were a good master,
Godefroy. sire Godefroy!
Yes, Godefroy.
The best master.
Better than Montfaucon.
One minute, vassal.
No vassal.
No more vassals.
Leave your Lord alone, peasants. who does he think he is?
Peasants? what does he mean?
Problem, chief?
No.
Listen up.
- we can go home.
- Home?
Beer and Pernod?
Godefroy, I'm staying.
The beer and the Pernod: are they for you?
Okkk ayyy.
Lady Ginette proposed to me. who's the bozo?
A lounge lizard with that floozy. she's wearing high heels.
Come back!
Best wishes to Lady Frenegonde.
I'll miss you, but I'm too happy here.
You lunatic!
There's nothing for us here.
I'll make do.
You're wearing goddamned boots!
Let me go!
I don't want your scummy shoes!
Return here hastily.
I refuse. very well. whatever you say.
You're not angry?
No. we all must die.
Yes, I must warn you, Crass One.
I happened upon a wizard today.
He told me if you didn't return before the full moon, your innards would rot.
You'll die in great pain.
I don't believe you.
You want to scare me.
You're already rotting.
Take as proof the fetid odor in your mouth.
Come back before tweIve, or else, farewell. sire Godefroy. sire Godefroy.
Excuse my abruptness, but I'm o'erjoyed to return home.
Leaving already?
How nice. where do you live exactly?
Home. where is "home"?
Here and there.
You couldn't understand.
They're plotting something.
They were nosing around the chimney.
Really...
I'll conduct an investigation concerning your strange guest.
Peasant, come here. what the hell, ass-breath!
You smell like a dead skunk! where is Lady Beatrice? she's upstairs changing.
Your cousin has agreed to dine with Mr. Bernay of the Bernay and Bernay Bank.
Our bank has aIways appreciated the aristocracy.
May the Lord bless you, kind Bernay and Bernay.
Is he teasing me?
I doubt it.
To think my ancestors built all this!
- That dungeon is to die for!
- we almost did.
- what were you doing?
- I was showing... my all-too-logical husband how we almost found the treasure.
You played doctor there?
Leave me now.
You called me, Mr. Bernay?
Tell me, Jacquart, is your cousin Montmirail a little la-dee-dah-ish? what is la-dee-dah-ish?
Anyone can have a gay cousin and an alcoholic father.
There's no cause for embarrassment. who are you to insult my happily-retired father?
Do I ask if your father farts?
Or if your wife boozes it up in the closet?
Talking about his family is a major taboo.
You know the dungeon? what is this?
You entered my chamber without requesting audience?
Anything found in the dungeon belongs to the hotel. whatever it's worth. what is that? Crack?
LsD?
Hand it over.
I'll have it analyzed.
No tricks! I'm armed!
Hilda? still there? Lucky me.
Jump in a taxi and bring me my black cocktail dress. we have a dinner.
Hub, knock first!
The little red balls. what now?
You want a tranquilizer, Hub? what's wrong?
He's making progress.
He realizes he's cracking up.
Maybe he'll ask to be locked up.
I am totally disappointed in you.
I swear.
Free us immediately.
I'll reduce the sentence.
- swallow, peasant.
- Enough's enough.
Don't bother with me.
I'll keep quiet.
- Is your cousin Hubert joining us?
- soon.
They stop serving at 9:30.
Countess.
Let us eat.
Did you know this dungeon existed?
Of course not!
Help! where is sergeant-Major Gibon? with Jacques-Henri.
Go have a drink.
On the house.
'Twas much more hospitable in the past. we burned entire trees.
The walls and floors were covered with rugs.
Not an evening went by without jugglers, minstrels, and trollops.
I remember one evening, the fire-eater set afire
Lady Flegmonde's wig. we had to throw her into the icy moat, fully-dressed.
Family souvenirs are so vivid.
He tells them so well.
You feel you're there. where?
Isn't he the bum from the church?
Are you okay, sugardaddy?
I'm still not used to this jalopy.
Evening, wench.
Hiya Missy. sir, ma'am... where's Mr. Godefroy, dammit?
There.
Ladies and Gents.
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening, sir.
My Jacquasse. You came.
I am relieved.
Ladies and Gents.
Mr. Goulard.
Come drink to our friends, my Crass.
Before we leave. when is that?
This evening.
- Tonight?
- Traveling by night?
Indeed.
I prefer night-driving.
I have 20/20 vision.
There are fewer road hogs.
Except in the fog.
I'm a helicopter-man myself.
I am not going, sire. we're getting hitched.
He's too shy to ask you to be best man.
You can stay too.
I have the antidote against rot.
- Your purse, Ginette.
- Hold on, babe.
My bag's a mess. so much room you can shit in it! what? what do you do, Mr...
Kass, as in... "gas".
No rot can resist tooth pate! what?
Pearly white!
How 'bout that?
That was really gross.
Enough. what are you doing, bruiser?
Throwing him out.
Let go of him! what's going on?
Are you okay?
No, sire!
You can't force me to go home!
I'm not a vassal anymore! I'm free!
Long live the Revolution!
Look.
He's your youngling too.
He was a good man.
He knew about justice.
They cut off his head, peasant.
Freddy!
Help! who's that?
Your youngling.
You jailed him?
I left it so they'll find him.
Drink!
I'm in pain!
Hub, it's Bea. what happened to Mr. Kass?
My God! My belly!
I have no time. Listen.
I'm listening, Hubert.
I'm not Hubert.
I'm Godefroy Amaury de Malfete,
Count of Montmirail, of Apremont and of Popincourt. son of Aldebert de Malfete and Thibaude de Montfaucon.
I am your ancestor.
Torch.
Fred, it's you. Freddy.
I beg your pardon, youngling.
I'm sick of your song and dance.
I don't believe a word of it. so spill the beans. shit! Damn it!
You don't believe me? I'll show you something you've never seen.
That no one has ever seen.
That you'll never see again. sit thyself down, and watch.
I'm going to vomit.
Does your tummy ache? where is Mr. Kass?
How did "Jacky" get so rich?
An antique car is no bargain.
It's his own personal fortune.
His family owns this joint.
He wants us to tie the knot. why didn't you tell me from the start?
I did.
You wouldn't listen.
You're right.
I'm sorry Godefroy.
I'm going, Beatrice.
I am very happy to have known you.
Godefroy, I'm so moved. what can I say? we'll never meet again.
It is so unique to be able to touch you, my youngling, my ever-so-young youngling.
You know,
I lied.
I was not searching for a treasure, but for the magic potion.
Pardon me.
No treasure can replace our having met.
Indeed.
Nothing can equal meeting one's descendants.
Bea? Are you there?
My life will seem so boring now.
You must forget me.
You have your children.
Give Florian and Ondine a big kiss from an old ancestor.
And deep in your soul, keep a memory of me.
I love you, my Beatrice.
I love you too.
A secret passage. This way! sergeant-Major Gibon?
Are you okay?
You're not hurt?
No, Jean-Pierre. where did Hubert go?
You're too rational to understand. spare me your lame interpretations.
Answer me, please. where is your cousin?
He left with Mr. Kass.
Is the sheriff gone? what are you saying?
Mr. Kass is here.
Mr. Kass!
Hush! I must find Lady Ginette. who left with...? shit!
A bear is chasing her! steer clear, beloved! steer clear!
Come back!
If you find enough force in yourself, you will be able to change the course of the arrow.
Holy scrotums!
You almost pierced'st me! slay the father of my lady-love?
Your absence was an eternity, dear Godefroy.
- It's hard!
- sorry, beloved.
Jacquasse, where are you, peasant?
Fetch my crossbow.
He's here, sire.
A-snoring in clown clothes. where are we? where's Freddy? who are you?
Take my crossbow.
Oil it at the castle. what are you doing here?
Jump in the river.
You stinketh. so Crass?
Have you been sucking up wine? what the hell is going on?
Obey your Lord. I don't want to whip you on his wedding day!
Indeed!
Obey hastily, my Jacquasse. shit!
Fuck!
Freakkky!
Okkk ayyy!
Hand over your jewels!
Cousin Hubert! what is this nightmare? what the hell is going on?
I'm hallucinating! what the hell is going on? subtitled by Andrew Litvak
A little hello to credit-loverS!
Hi, Douglas.
How's it going?
- What did you do?
- Demo'ed the driveway.
- Nice job, too.
- What's the problem?
It's the wrong driveway.
That's a problem, isn't it?
2933, Vic.
This is 2935!
We're in the wrong...
These guys are morons.
- I'm sorry. It's going to cost.
- It's going to cost who?
I'm in a bad way right now.
Money's very tight with me.
I can't afford to eat this, even if it was my fault.
Shut up, Vic.
What am I going to do?
All right.
We're going to do both driveways.
No matter how long it takes.
And if you say one more word -
- I'll beat you to death with a drywall hammer.
- You got it?
- It makes sense to me. Thank you.
Hello. Kinney.
Problem this morning? Giving away free driveways? Come to my place.
No. Fax those plans right now.
Hold on.
Hi, hon. I was just about to call.
What's the matter?
Really? No, I know what it is.
It's the hot water heater.
My fax machine's gone psycho again.
What's up?
Do you hate me?
Do you want me dead? A guy from
Beverly Hills is going to sue me.
- You ruined his driveway?
- Yes, we did.
- Like a prank?
- No, Del.
Don't worry about it. It's my fault.
I'll fix it on my own time.
When? Ted told me you haven't finished the Malibu job yet.
You know what I think?
- No, what do you think?
- We'll have to put in more hours.
This isn't a nine-to-five job.
We had a saying where I worked last.
"Unless you come in Saturday, don't bother coming in Sunday."
- Are we going to work weekends?
- Weekends, nights, holidays.
My office. Two minutes.
Do you have any stegosauruses?
No. I have an iguanodon and a tyrannosaurus.
I fished a stegosaurus.
Hi. dad.
- Good hand. Hi.
- Did you look at the water heater?
- I just walked in the door.
- No bath tonight, Zack.
Brush your teeth and go to bed.
You missed Campfire Girls.
I'm not in Campfire Girls.
I'm a Brownie.
- It was Jennifer's graduation.
- Man, I forgot!
I phoned and reminded you.
I totally forgot.
Was she upset?
Yes. All the fathers were there.
Even the divorced ones.
- And the lesbian moms?
- Both of them.
- Where is she now?
- In the den. Drinking.
- She's asleep. Where were you?
- I had to work late.
- King fired DeGrazzi.
- You're kidding. Why?
He does bad work.
But at least he does it slowly.
- Who will replace him?
- The guy you sleep with.
The video store guy.
I knew you were dating, but not that you were sleeping with him.
That's great. It's like a promotion.
It's not great?
- Guess who'll do my job.
- You're going to do it all?
- Will they give you more money?
- It's more of a prestige thing.
They'll probably give me a plaque or a certificate for being so great.
That's ridiculous. We hardly ever see you. Can't you say no?
Yes, if you want to catch your own food. Don't worry. It'll be okay.
I'll go check on the water heater.
Jennifer Kinney.
I'll seek the way that'll bring me to the fllre of kindness, -
- Lighted by those who have gone on the Campfllre Trall.
That's so great.
I don't know.
I'll have to think about it.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
I'll call you. Thanks. Bye.
- Hi. Hungry?
- No. I'm too tired to eat.
- Who was that?
- Valerie.
Who helped her dial the phone?
Don't start. The company made her regional manager.
When I quit work to have Zack, they thought more of me than of Valerie.
- Did she call to tell you the news?
- No...
She offered me her old job, now that she's been promoted.
- Are you going back to work?
- Yes. What do you think?
What do I think?
The first couple of months you won't make anything because it's hard.
We're paying more for child care.
We're both working and then we're both not going to Campfire Girls.
- Maybe you could help out more.
- How am I going to work that out?
I just meant in emergencies.
A real estate emergency?
My whole life's an emergency.
I'm not going back to work, am l?
We always said I would, but now I realise I never will.
Take my job. Go build condos.
Make sure to be there at 6:00.
Call an exorcist.
I don't know where it came from.
I'm sorry, Laura.
I'm sorry.
This is stupid.
We just need to get a schedule.
We don't need a schedule.
We need a miracle.
GEMINI INSTITUTE
MALIBU. CALIFORNIA
Once we get all this duct work in, this should just fly.
Are you paid to watch her ass?
Because you do an excellent job.
We've got a problem down here.
I don't believe this.
Have a seat.
Damn!
Get out of the way.
Man. what is this?
I'm sorry. I just went crazy.
We'll turn the water back on now.
- This thing goes off all the time.
- Tough business.
- What do you do?
- Not mine. Yours.
Yes, really tough.
What do you do to relax?
- Well, play golf.
- That's a great game. How often?
Let's see...
Never. I'll have to cut back.
That's really going to hurt.
You don't have to live this way.
With all due respect...
I forgot to go to medical school.
- I can help you.
- Help me how?
Change your life.
- What do you guys do around here?
- We make miracles.
Sure.
Call me.
I feel guilty for not spending enough time with my family.
Then I get resentful because l don't have enough time for myself.
Work is first, my family is a close second and I'm a distant third.
- Is that crazy?
- I'm not a psychiatrist.
And you don't need one. Real problems require real solutions.
- Well, then... What do you do?
- I told you. I make miracles. l create time. l make clones.
Doug, sit down.
I'm a geneticist. 15 years ago
I started cloning viruses.
And then, ten years ago,
I cloned an earthworm.
- God bless you, sir.
- And then... a chimp.
And last year...
Last year...
- Hi there.
- Just in time.
- Doug is doing our new offices.
- I know Doug.
He and I went over the plans one day. You were sailing.
Wait a minute.
- You understand my suggestion?
- Sure. What's not to understand?
- You xerox people.
- In a way.
The procedure takes about two hours.
It takes more or less two hours.
Then you have everything you need.
What is it that I need?
- Time!
- All you need. For everything.
Let's say I was interested.
What would a..?
Nothing fancy, just a basic...
What would a basic clone job cost?
- Doctor, we're ready for you.
- Very good.
I hate to sound like a baby, but promise me it'll be all right.
You're going to be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.
- I won't be like them. will I?
- I hope not.
Watch your head.
Lie back and put your feet in the stirrups.
Did you see "The Fly"? Jeff Goldblum came out with enormous eyes.
Peripheral vision is one thing, but this is a bad look.
And he eats everything with these little hands and everything.
Take it easy.
Well... What is that thing?
- This'll help you relax.
- So far it isn't working.
I'm sorry. My uncle went to the dentist, and he was never the same.
I don't know if he got that suction thing lodged in his throat.
But after that he was always,
"Hi, Doug... What's wrong?"
- Count backwards from 100.
- Sure. Like that'll work.
- Am I all right?
- You're fine.
Well?
I mean...
Is it..? Is it a boy?
I mean, did it work?
- Is that it?
- No. I'm afraid you're it.
What do you mean?
I can't be it.
- You mean. I'm the clone?
- That's right.
- No. I'm me. He must be the clone.
- No. I'm me.
- Help me out. I'm me, right?
- Look here.
- I must be me.
- Hold this.
Attaboy.
Now... look here.
- You see that?
- I see a "2".
There you go.
Wait, I remember everything.
I came in. I put this on.
I remember getting the shot.
You have all Doug's feelings and memories right up to the cloning.
But now, when you have different experiences, you'll diverge.
- What do I feed it?
- Feed it? What am l? A hamster?
- Sorry. I mean, it eats something.
- He's a person, just like you.
He'll get duplicate identification here. You take care of the rest.
Now I'll leave you two alone.
You'll have a lot to talk about.
Astonishing.
- What?
- Nothing.
So... Where are you from?
- Stay down low. Really low.
- You want me to get under the car?
Good.
Laura's not home.
- The Mildew Suite.
- We'll fix it all up.
Am I really going to live here?
You can't live with me and Laura.
She'll wake up, roll over and say:
"Doug, you two have to get to work or you'll be late."
Don't worry. We'll clean up, put down some rugs, get a TV...
We ought to get a satellite dish.
Get all the sports and movies...
I don't know about that...
I don't think Laura'll go for that.
- I knew it. You're whipped.
- I'm not whipped.
You're whipped, partner.
- Fine, I'm whipped.
- Some guys are whipped. It's okay.
No, you're right.
We've got to get a plan together.
Think fast. Wear these till you get some of your own.
Don't make me want to kick your ass.
Come on. Come on.
Look at this. This is a great coat. l love this old coat.
- Always use the garden gate.
- We should black out the windows.
Good idea. We have to come up with a strategy for work.
- We're going to get a lot done.
- We're going to kick ass.
- And Ted...
- We're going to destroy Ted.
We'll ruin him. Bring him down.
Crush him. And I'll break his neck.
Laura's home.
Hi, honey.
Zack, help me.
- What are you doing up there?
- I was looking for something.
- You look really beautiful today.
- I do?
Do you want to go to the pony rides?
We could go to the movies tonight.
We could car pool, if you want.
No, I could pick you up.
- Doug! When did you get here?
- Six. Half day today, Teddy?
Let's have that meeting now, Del.
Here's the report on the Palisades.
- When did you do all this?
- We should do them every morning.
Two minutes. Conference room.
Sure...
Find out what he had for breakfast.
- Morning. Meeting start yet?
- I thought you were in the meeting.
- Did you see me?
- Yes, but in a different shirt.
Yes, but do you know why?
I spilled coffee on it.
- Then I went to my truck when...
- I was in the ladies room?
Perfect. I have another shirt. which I keep for emergencies.
Like when I spill coffee.
Also, I got out my briefcase.
Then I came back. and I forgot the meeting had started.
- Shouldn't you go back in?
- Yes, but I must go to the truck.
I'll get the original shirt.
It's dry now. And I like it better.
So when I come out of the meeting
I'll be wearing the original shirt.
- Are you okay?
- No problem. Never been better.
Why don't you forget all about it?
- Del King Construction.
- Is Doug Kinney there?
- He's in a meeting. Who is it?
- Carl.
- Roger.
- Roger who?
Carl Rogerson.
Phone call for you, Doug.
- What's going on?
- Who is it?
It's me. You.
It's us.
Hold on. I'll take it in my office.
I'm too busy to talk to myself.
- What's up?
- What are you doing there?
- Where should I be?
- I mean, you just went to work?
- You wanted to be home more.
- Yes, but we must discuss this.
We have to coordinate some stuff.
Anyway, how's it going?
Good. Everything's under control.
I'll go out to the Palisades later.
- Then I'll go by Sherman Oaks.
- I took care of it, pal.
- I'll go to North Hollywood.
- I'll do that on the way.
- Reseda?
- Already did it.
I'll tell you what then...
What should I do?
I don't know. Start living it up.
I've got to go.
Kinney!
You think you're hot shit.
But you won't fool anybody.
You read me?
I'm on top of you.
I see you, my friend.
Take this one.
What are you doing?
Don't kick it.
It's not soccer.
Fall on it! Fall on the ball!
Defence, let's go.
Zack!
- Mom said you had to work.
- You're playing, I'm coming.
You looked good.
Go sit with your team.
I don't pay 160 bucks to sit and watch my kid eat oranges.
He played four downs. That's all
I have to play him. Period.
Let go of that. I'm a lawyer, not just a coach. I'll kick your ass...
Don't touch me! Back off.
I've had it!
- I don't need this.
- Don't pay attention to those guys.
I'm doing the best I can do.
It's not like I'm getting paid.
- No. You could be out playing golf.
- I love golf.
They don't know what they're talking about. I appreciate what you do.
Can I mention one thing? You should think about a multiple-set offence.
- Four of these kids are morons.
- I understand. If you used Zack...
- Zack is my kid.
- That's it. Here you go.
You turn this franchise around.
See you in the Super Bowl.
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Dad's cooking dinner.
- Spaghetti?
- Yes. Just like the old days.
Dad's the new football coach.
He's great. We scored!
We've got a good team.
Go get washed up for dinner.
Thanks for coaching, Dad.
- I thought you had extra work.
- Not any more.
- Did you get fired?
- No, no.
I was tired of carrying that heavy load, so I went in to King and said:
"You either get me some help or I'm walking." Taste this.
- What did he say?
- What do you think he said?
I thought he was going to cry.
But he agreed to hire some help.
- The guy's like an assistant.
- I'm glad. Who?
Who? You mean, who's the guy?
Just a guy.
A new guy you don't know.
Very new guy.
- What you're saying is, he's new?
- He's going to run everything.
- And you trust him?
- Yes, like I trust myself.
- Great. What will you do now?
- Now? I don't know.
Right now I thought
I might do this.
- I want you to take that new job.
- My job? You mean it?
Yes! I can still drop off the kids at school and I can leave by three.
So if you can just back me up occasionally.
- Let's get the kids to bed early.
- What time is it?
- Kids, bedtime!
Hi, Doug.
- Hi. Vic. What time is it?
- It's... 5:30 in New York.
- Then it's 2:30 here.
- Why is it on New York time?
I bought it in New York and couldn't reset the darn thing.
- When did I tell you to be here?
- No specific time.
Yes. 1 :30.
In fact, I repeated it twice.
Do you want solid or laminate?
That's strange. For some reason
2:30 just stuck in my head.
I'll stick something in your head.
You're fired.
Take your New York watch and your fat ass and get out of here.
- For being a few minutes late?
- No, no. Three, four. That's a few.
You were 60 minutes late.
That's not a few. Hit it.
Is this a negotiating tactic?
I'm on my way.
Take your hands off me, now.
Now I'm getting mad. You've made a point. What's happening now?
Are you guys on a break?
Let's go!
- What got into you today?
- I should've fired him long ago.
- But he has like 34 kids.
- He's been married 17 times.
- What have you got there?
- You ought to see these plans.
Hi, it's me. I need to work late.
Could you pick up the kids?
- Sure.
- It's not that simple.
- It's picture day at ballet class.
- That'll be cute.
Go home, give her a bath, mousse her hair and be there at 4:30.
- Can you do this?
- I can do it. I'll see you.
Okay. Bye.
- Hello?
- Take the kids to the ballet.
- Wait. I was just teeing off here.
- Not today, pal. See you later.
I don't want a shower.
I want a bath. I hate showers!
Zack, get her on that side.
Contain her.
- You're going.
- I'm not going.
Let me see.
Turn around.
Good. I like it.
Let's go.
Hi. Sorry we're late.
We're here for the pictures.
Didn't anyone call you?
It was changed to tomorrow.
- No, seriously. The pictures.
- Tomorrow.
Get a photographer down here now.
- Right now.
- I'll see what I can do.
Hello? She's not here right now.
You can leave a message.
Hold on a second.
Can you call back?
I have a little emergency here.
One of the kids swallowed a spoon.
No, just a teaspoon. She'll live.
Keep it down!
- He took it.
- Zack, give it back to her.
I'm telling you, give it back.
- Doodyhead!
- You're a doodyhead.
Bath time. Go on up and don't come out till you're married.
- Could we have some cake?
- Get up there.
I'm sorry. This couple wanted to see the same house over and over.
- We're both here.
- Of course, sir. Right this way.
- This is like having an affair.
- We're too busy to have an affair.
I think he likes you.
I like him too, but there's no future in it. Besides, I have you.
What are we celebrating?
You know.
I've been thinking...
- This isn't working out.
- What?
This new arrangement.
I'm not getting anything done.
All I do is cook and do laundry.
I pick up and drop off the kids, dress them and clean up after them.
I've done that for ten years.
You've done it for a month.
- It comes more naturally to you.
- How so?
You're a nurturer. You are.
First of all you have two
X-chromosomes, and I have...
It's scientifically proven. That's why you have breasts and I don't.
Just what are you saying?
This system isn't working. We have to go back to the way it was.
You take care of the house. and I do what I need to do.
And what do you need to do?
I have to go back to work.
And that's it.
No, that's not it. I love my job, and I'm doing great at it.
Valerie is moving me into estates.
I'll be making a good living soon.
I know it's hard, and I can imagine your day, but I'm not quitting.
We'll just have to work it out.
And that is it.
It's funny you think that's it.
Because that's not it.
What I said... That's it.
What you said... not it.
No, Doug. This is it.
I can't believe you lured me here for this.
Can I have some water?
I didn't lure you into anything.
I had no idea. You tease me and I kind of liked it...
But I thought you were a happily married guy.
- I sleep in the guest house.
- My God. Is it that bad?
It's pretty bad.
She's sleeping with another guy.
That's the God's honest truth.
- She doesn't even know I exist.
- It must be so hard for you.
- It is.
- Do you want to go to my place?
- I understand...
- Doug, are you all right?
- What's wrong?
- It's a football injury. Rose Bowl.
- You played?
- I fell out of the bleachers.
Can I help you to the car?
- Let's get some dessert.
- You're still hungry?
My life's a shambles.
I need pie.
Can you breathe?
Should I Heimlich you?
- I'll get you some more water.
- No! Laura! Look at me.
- How do I look?
- Crazy.
Let's order. Let's get something to eat. We'll feel better.
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- Me too. To the men's room.
I mean, I'll accompany you to...
You know what I mean.
Boy, everything looks so good.
Doug, that's the wine list.
I thought there were a hell of a lot of beverages on there.
Will you order? You know what I like. Anything with barbecue sauce.
- What are you doing here?
- It's my favourite restaurant.
- I know. What about Noreen?
- She's a colleague. We're talking.
- Come on. You're up to something.
- Are you jealous?
- You can't cheat on Laura.
- You can't. I never get to see her.
- This isn't working out.
- What do you mean?
Our deal. We'll switch. I'll go back to work and you'll stay home.
I'm going to do housework?
I thought you were joking. There's no way that's ever going to happen.
I got you the job, pal!
You think I'm a genie? You rub a lamp and I do what you want me to?
- I have things I need to do.
- Look, things change...
You took away my wife, my family, my friends. All I have is my job.
I'm doing the work you couldn't do.
And I'm making it pay, so back off.
- I'm just washing his face.
- Of course. Please, carry on.
- What are you doing?
- I had to do something.
We'll talk later. I'll distract
Laura. Get Noreen out of here.
He's in way over his head.
Doug, I'm ready for dessert.
That's not your sport coat.
I switched with a guy in the men's room.
We traded. Men do that all the time.
- Let's go.
- I thought you wanted pie.
It's your wife!
- May we join you?
- Have we met?
- What happened to your shirt?
- Water spots.
- I don't want to fight about this.
- Great.
- About what?
- My job.
Hell, no. We don't want to fight about that. That'd be dumb.
- Laura, do you love me?
- Of course I love you.
Then kiss me.
Come on. Let's go.
That guy looks a lot...
I'm sorry... He's kissing her!
- Come on.
- Stop pushing?
Hi.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
You want a beer?
Actually I could use a couple.
Two, I'd like you to meet...
- Three.
- Hi, how are you?
Are you nuts?
Are you mentally nuts?
- I have it all figured out.
- What do we need him for?
He's going to help me with the kids, and when you're not working -
- you guys can hang out together.
- I'm giddy!
- We could do a lot together.
- You're lonely. I got you a friend.
- Where is he going to stay?
Here with you. That way you have a friend and a roommate. Look at him.
I have an idea. How about no?
Doug, he needs space.
It's a shock. I think.
The idea was for you to work while
I was with Laura and the kids.
Well, it isn't working. I need a break, so I can work on the house.
Or sit and think a single thought.
Or play golf every once in a while.
I've been working since I was
12 years old. It's break time.
I think the 12-year-old is saying:
"You need time for Doug."
- What a suck!
- I don't know what a suck is.
- Come on. For Doug.
- Fine. Screw your life up.
- You're in way over your head.
- You're two good-looking guys.
- I'll make this up to you.
- Start by cloning Laura.
Cloning, Laura...
Bye, Doug. Have a good time.
I'm worried about him.
He's uptight, isn't he?
He'll be all right.
That's a lot of ribs.
What is that? A slab?
Okay kids, hurry up.
We're going to be late.
Books, jackets.
I'll drive the kids to school. Take a couple of minutes to yourself.
- Thanks.
- That's all right.
Look, what I said about you quitting your job... Forget it.
You have as much right to work as I do.
- You mean it?
- I mean it.
I just want you to be happy.
I'll give you a foot rub tonight.
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm baking. Where are you?
At the Laker game. I meant to go home, but I felt like stopping here.
Have a good time.
- Did you hear from Two?
- He's still at work.
The guy's a horse.
I'll be home soon.
All right.
See you.
- What happened?
- Nothing. I had a terrible dream.
- What was it? Your dream?
- I don't know.
Go back to sleep.
Everything will be okay.
What was that all about?
Up there, with Laura?
- Who won the game?
- Don't worry about that. Lakers.
- What were you doing in bed?
- Nothing.
We were watching TV. Laura wanted to go to bed. What could I do?
What do you mean,
"she wanted to go to bed"?
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
- Did you have sex with my wife?
- No!
No, Douglas! Here was the plan.
When she was asleep, I'd sneak out.
I guess I dozed off.
Nothing happened.
She did kind of brush me in that region, but I mamboed out of there.
Doug, he mamboed out.
Listen to me. Both of you.
Rule number one.
It's unbreakable.
Don't even try to bend this rule.
Nobody has sex with my wife but me.
Fabulous rule, Doug.
- No clone nookie.
- You're the man, Doug.
Original nookie only.
- We're clear on that rule, right?
- Absolutely. It's locked in here.
- So, did you?
- No!
- Wimp.
- Slob.
The mambo king.
Watch the stern there!
Number eight, it's a boat, not a bathtub.
- Did you enjoy sailing?
- It was more like bumper cars.
How about a nice
"I sailed with Walt" T-shirt?
Do you have an
"I got a refund from Walt" T-shirt?
I'd like to learn how to sail.
Do you have anything big enough -
- to take my whole family out and not end up like Gilligan?
Great show. Remember the one with the Harlem Globetrotters?
That was good. Believable, too.
- What the hell are you doing?
- How many of you are there?
That's our brother Doug. This is
Patti and Beth. We were dancing.
One's cuter than the next.
Are you as much fun as Lance and Rico?
Lance and Ri..?
- You're Rico, I'm guessing.
- Guess again.
Even he can't tell them apart.
Look, can we have some privacy?
We have to have a family meeting.
- Wait..
- We were going to have a party.
- You're kidding, right?
- No.
- Are you a drag or what?
- Try to keep your voices down.
Goodnight, Lance!
Goodnight, Rico!
The adventures of Lance and Rico.
- Where did you meet them, Lance?
- They work at the Minimart.
Yes, they're clerks.
- Were the Slurpee girls busy?
- I stopped to pick up my dinner.
She offered to nuke my corn dog.
What am I going to say? No?
So we came back here to party.
- They were two very nice women.
- "Women" being the key word here.
You can't just bring strangers up here.
- Are we supposed to be monks?
- He has a point.
A damn good point.
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- I'm having a smoke.
- I can see that, but why?
I spent 1,000 dollars to quit.
Remember?
- Looks like it didn't take.
- Don't ever do that again.
- What are you going to do about it?
- I'll hit you so hard, he'll die.
Guys, come on. Let's sit down and talk. You're angry. Like two lions.
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry.
- Where's your aspirin?
- Tylenol. In the kitchen.
I'll find it.
I'll find it.
Look at this place. It's a mess.
I can't leave you for a minute.
One, two, three, four.
Doug, if I might...
One, two, three...
- Four...
- Twelve.
Doug, I'd like you to meet Four.
I got a wallet.
That guy gave it to me.
I'm going to drive a car.
He's got a wallet.
Come here. Come here.
- Where did he come from?
- He'll help us out around here.
Do the day-to-day stuff. Clean the house, take out the trash and so on.
Forget that!
What the hell is wrong with him?
Nothing.
Nothing's really wrong.
He's a little special.
He's fine. He'll be all right.
- He's special, all right.
- We made a copy from Two.
Sometimes a copy from a copy is not quite as sharp as the original.
Leeds loved it. because it was very experimental.
We got a great deal.
Leeds loved it?
Good. Because I hate it.
You can't just go around cloning people. That's crazy!
Listen up.
Listen really clearly to me.
Rule number two. First of all...
We all remember rule number one.
- No sleeping with your wife.
- That's important.
- Rule number two: No more Dougs.
- This is plenty, I think.
I'll call Leeds tomorrow. We're out of the Doug-making business.
- Am I clear? Am I clear on this?
- The book's closed on that one.
I like pizza.
I like it!
We're going to need a cage.
Bye, Steve.
Good party.
I like Steve.
- How did it go?
- I'm telling you, this is great!
You want some really great sailing?
Bring Mrs. Doug tomorrow -
- and come to Catalina with Robin and me on my big boat.
We'll cruise the Avalon Harbour at sunset. Champagne on board.
We'd leave you alone. You make love right on the boat. Very romantic.
- Think about Catalina.
- I'll call you.
Honey, may I do that?
I want to show you something.
First of all, this piece of aluminium foil is too small.
It can't cover it all, so you'll get that hard crust around the meat. -
- and nobody wants to eat that.
At Christmas time we can make an ornament out of it.
And save those fries. We'll paint them and hang them on the tree.
The kids are going to love that.
Okay, we'll take a fresh piece.
Now we fold up one side.
Make sure we're even.
Then I fold once. twice or three times. Whatever you need to fold it.
But don't just roll it over. Then you have that lump in the middle.
Fold it nicely, so no air gets in there. Air is our enemy.
Then take this.
Tuck, tuck, fold. T.T.F.
Two tucks and a fold.
I just think of Elizabeth Taylor.
Now roll it over nice and flat.
No air is going to get in there.
We could send it off to NASA and nothing would happen. Now, the lid.
That's very nice.
Very nice.
Doug, I've noticed some things about you lately that make me think...
- What?
- Nothing.
Go like this.
Can I just do something?
See what that does? It frames you better. It gives you height.
Why don't you go relax and let me finish cleaning up?
Why?
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
Freezer. Second shelf.
With all the other meat products.
Unless it's in a skin casing.
Then it goes lower... In the bin.
That was a great meal, honey.
- You cooked it.
- But you ate it.
Were you wearing that shirt earlier?
- This? Yes, sure.
- I'm losing it.
Dad, watch this.
- I'll show you "walking the dog".
- You just showed me before dinner.
I did?
That's right. I forgot.
You want to go get some ice cream?
Unless we already did.
- Doug, did you decide?
- Did I decide what?
What we talked about all evening.
You said you'd think about it.
I did.
I gave it a lot of thought.
What did you think?
Well, I gave it a lot of thought.
I think whatever you think is probably the smartest thing to do.
Don't put this all on me.
They're your kids, too.
Can I say something?
Let's leave the kids out of this.
You want to go to Disney World without the kids?
No. I don't want to do that.
That wouldn't be fair to the kids.
To go, just you and me, would be stupid. When is it we're going?
- Christmas. I bought the tickets.
- Are you nuts?
- You told me to buy them.
- Not me.
- Not me. Not me.
- You're driving me crazy!
I call and you bite my head off.
At times you're as sweet as can be.
Then you're obsessed with details, and now you don't even listen to me.
- What is going on with you?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong with me.
You could have bipolar disorder or multiple personalities.
Let's sail to Catalina.
- Drink wine and make love.
- Doug, you don't sail.
But I drink and make love.
The sailing... How hard can it be?
We can't just sail off to Catalina.
Let's be spontaneous!
We used to do stuff like this.
You're the one who wants to go to Ecuador and throw harpoons.
- Doug, that's just talk.
- Let's do it. Why not?
Your job. My job. Jennifer's dance recital. The Donaldsons' party.
- I'm not going to that.
- You said you were.
When you figure out what you want, would you just let me know?
- Hello?
- In here, Doug.
Three?
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure, Doug.
- What's up?
- I have to go away.
- It's a business trip.
- Business trip?
- I handle the business.
- He does. Steve.
Fine. it's not business. I need to be alone and figure some things out.
You need to get centered. Good idea.
You deserve that.
- You have to be me night and day.
- What about rule number one?
Rule number one. Steve!
What's rule number one?
Rain Man, go floss yourself.
The rule stands. Remember when I had a bronchial infection? You got it.
Cough. Tell her you don't want her to catch it. Can you handle that?
- I have a sore throat and a fever.
- Do you want me to handle it?
- No. Thanks, though.
- I'm just trying to help out.
- Is he safe with that?
- We take the blade out.
We shave him while he's sleeping.
It's cute.
All right, I'm counting on you.
Hi. Walt.
- Where's your wife?
- She couldn't make it.
Don't you want to wait until she can come?
- No. she'll come next time.
- All right. Come aboard.
Doug...
I'm sorry. I understand why you wanted us to go away together.
It sounded romantic. But we don't have to go away to make love.
- Are you all right?
- I'm coming down with something.
I've got a lot of phlegm, and I'm burning up.
I think I have a fever.
We'd better not get close tonight.
- I'm not worried.
- I don't want you to get sick.
I just think... You know what?
Maybe if you'd not do that...
- Maybe I ought to sleep in the den.
- Just relax.
Hey, did you hear from your parents?
How are they?
I'm really feeling sick.
I'm going to make you feel better.
- You weren't that sick after all.
- No. I guess not.
That was so unusual.
I've never seen you cry like that.
That time when the souffle fell.
But besides that... l guess I was just moved by it all.
- You know what I want now?
- No.
Graham crackers and chocolate milk.
- You want some?
- No, thanks. I've had plenty.
What have I done?
What have I done?
- Hey! Who ate all the bologna?
- Burglars.
- Did you eat everything?
- Count Chocula.
That's it. I'm starving. I'll sneak in and get something to eat.
Doug, you startled me!
Change your mind?
Yes, I changed my mind.
I think.
Want some?
You taste good.
You taste pretty good yourself.
Remember when we used to make love all over the house?
I remember.
Aren't you hungry?
Boy, I could go for one of these...
... canned hams.
Wait. I don't know if this is... the worst idea in the world.
I don't think we should do this. l have a really bad cough.
Of course it could clear up in a second.
I want you.
I'm not so sure... Okay.
Grab that.
That was athletic.
Better than the Stair-Master.
I guess I got a little carried away.
Are you all right?
Shouldn't we go back upstairs?
- I guess. Here.
- Thanks.
Laura, I almost forgot. There are some things I have to take care of.
- I'll be up in a minute.
- The kids.
I forgot to shut the windows in the Volvo.
No problem. I'll get it.
Sorry about yelling!
Steve?
Oh, baby!
You're drenched.
I'm sorry. Come upstairs.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You're soaking. Come on and get out of these wet clothes.
I'm sorry, I was so selfish.
Let me help you with those pants.
Again?
- My peepee.
- I see.
So much for rule number one.
A hell of a ride.
Maybe we'll get the onshore wind tomorrow. That'll be easier.
You ought to sit up or you'll start feeling ill again.
- I'm sorry I hurled on your dog.
- It's not the first time.
Some people really shouldn't sail.
Maybe not. I was pretty miserable there for a while.
It wasn't just the getting sick part.
When I was down there with my head in the head...
My whole life actually flashed before my eyes.
The funny part is...
I wasn't in it.
I've got to get back into my life.
I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
But good luck to you.
- 103. You're not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere, Steve.
- The building inspector's coming.
- You're too sick to go anywhere.
- Del King.
- Del? It's Doug.
- How are you doing?
- Not good. I can't make it today.
- Why don't you rip out my liver?
- You're being a little dramatic?
If we don't get inspected today, that guy won't be back for a month.
I understand. But I'm really ill.
Can't someone else meet him?
Nobody knows this job like you do.
Get down here or you're fired!
Nice attitude. Del.
- He said...
- I heard him. I have to go.
- You can't go.
- I have to go.
- Maybe I'll lie down for a...
- Take care of him. I'm going.
Sorry, Steve, that leg has to come off.
All right.
So these are the water pipes.
And you've got hot and cold available in all units.
That's very nice.
And what's that? It looks like...
It's the gas line, which would feed natural gas to all appliances -
- which would require natural gas.
You're not answering the question.
- What was the question?
- The plan showed two-inch lines.
Go like this.
You've got something... That's it.
- Why did you go with one-inch?
- That's right. Now I remember.
So what's the answer?
Can you excuse me for a second?
Why did you decide to use one-inch gas lines?
Knock it off!
Originally there were two ovens, but King cut it back to one.
Got it. I remember now. The original plan called for two ovens.
Somebody decided to cut back to one to save money, I guess.
I like a double oven.
Sure there's a lot of bending, -
- but you can have a turkey in the bottom and rutabaga up top.
- It's nice for entertaining.
- But you stubbed out for two.
What if someone wants two ovens?
I don't know.
Hold on a second.
- This is ridiculous.
- Wait...
He can't answer the questions, he runs off. You know what that means?
- Alcohol and drugs.
- God knows what he's done here.
Because of the oven we took the laundry room off this line.
- We ran a separate line for that.
- What about the gas fireplaces?
Thinking. Thinking.
Boy, does he have some tough ones.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
Wait a second.
You're entitled to your opinion.
But it's not fair to judge anyone after one superficial conversation.
- We have to re-inspect everything.
- Kinney. Doug Kinney.
Stop all work until further notice.
I'll be back in about three weeks.
Get your act together or you'll lose your license. And get him some help.
You what?
You got fired? How?
No, no, no.
Just come home.
Doug, what are you doing home?
- Are you sick?
- Yes. We're out of Pepto-Bismol.
- What about your big inspection?
- I guess I missed it, didn't I?
Wasn't it important? I rearranged everything so you could go.
What are you, some kind of saint?
Do you want me to give you a medal?
Now I feel better.
Doug, you've been under a lot of pressure lately.
But when you talk like that,
I think you mean it. It hurts me.
Something is happening lately.
I feel like I don't know you.
It scares me, Doug.
You tell yourself that your problems aren't serious.
They happen to everyone. You hope they'll go away, but they don't.
It's like this house.
You always said you'd fix it up.
"I'll fix it," you always say.
But nothing ever gets fixed.
I need to know what you're feeling.
I need to know if you still love me.
Please, just tell me what you want.
I want pizza.
What?
I want pizza.
Give me some pizza.
Hey! Are you guys crazy?
What if Laura walks in?
Not much chance of that, sport.
- Where is she?
- She left you.
Nothing but tail lights.
She took the kids and went to her mother's. They're in Palm Springs.
- I'm sorry. Did you eat?
- Forget that! Wait a minute.
- What happened with Laura?
- We had a fight.
- Why were you even talking to her?
- It's complicated.
I was pissed off because I got fired.
No. he did. You couldn't answer a few, simple, basic questions.
Simple questions? It was like being on Jeopardy, for crying out loud.
- Knock it off!
- Puke-face.
Did you bring me a monkey?
- There's something else.
- What?
About rule number one...
What about it?
We bent it a little.
We bent it a lot.
Damn near broke the thing off.
- Did you sleep with my wife?
- Let's have some tea.
I'm sorry, Doug.
She's a powerful woman.
Take it easy!
She thought it was you.
The fact is...
She thought I was you, too.
- We're not perfect.
- We're not perfect.
I don't believe this!
I leave you alone for one day!
And you totally destroy my life.
We didn't destroy your life.
You did.
Actually, we were trying to save it, and we were doing pretty good.
We just had one really bad day.
We tried. She was unstoppable.
It was like she couldn't get...
She touched my peepee, Steve.
I don't understand this.
We've had fights before, but...
Why did she leave?
- You don't fix stuff.
- What?
You always say you're going to fix stuff, and then you don't.
Did Laura say that?
Maybe.
You talked to her before she left?
Maybe.
I don't remember.
This will refresh your memory.
Where do you put all that stuff?
Did you?
Did she tell you something?
She talked to me a lot.
She was afraid and she cried.
She cried?
She cried, because...
- Because I don't fix anything?
- She's scared.
She's scared.
- I'll buy you a present for this.
- A chainsaw?
Or a book. Something really nice.
Come on up.
I'm spitting on bugs.
- What's going on?
- I need you guys to help me.
I'm putting my life back together.
Come on. Let's go.
- About time.
- Polyblend.
- Steve, can I help?
- Grab the end of that plastic.
You said to be here at 8:30.
I'd like you to note the time.
- This thing drives me nuts.
I'm sorry I spoke to you like that.
You're the best cement man alive.
- Really?
- No. No one else was available.
I can accept that.
You said you had your own guys?
Hi. Vic.
- Let's go to work.
- Fair enough.
Okay, you heard him.
I made some really tasty sandwiches if you want one.
Great.
- Tuna with curried mayonnaise.
- I like that.
That's why I made them.
Let me ask you something.
The other night, when you were...
- When you were with Laura...
- I'll tell you something.
When she wants something, there's no stopping her.
- I don't want any details.
- No, no. I know.
You think that...
... that she liked you better than she likes me?
Of course not, Doug.
First of all, you are me.
- I am you. Do you understand?
- Yes, that's right.
I'm me, you're me and I'm you.
I know she loves you, Doug.
I wasn't there for her.
Even when I was there
I wasn't there.
Remember what you said about quality time with your family?
Trust me. It's all quality time.
That's for sure.
You have to brush your teeth.
Don't forget your books and jackets.
Grandpa will take you to school.
Dad! Did you come to take us home?
Go inside and let me talk to Dad.
You can see Daddy later.
Come on, you guys.
Hurry up.
- How was the desert?
- Great. Just what I needed.
I saw on the weather that it was like 175 degrees.
It was a little hot.
All right, here's the deal.
I'm going to ask you to come home.
But I won't plead with you.
If you say yes, great.
But don't expect me to stand in front of the neighbours and beg.
I don't think...
Stop it. Get up. Why didn't you talk to me? It was mean.
- That wasn't me.
- That's just the point.
I was a little confused about who
I was. All right, real confused.
Look, it's happened to you.
You want to be a mom and to work.
You want to be independent, but you need to be taken care of a little.
- It gets confusing, doesn't it?
- Yes.
Come home, so I can show you something.
Come on.
Just for a minute.
It's beautiful. Oh, Doug.
This is perfect.
Great, right?
The wall's gone.
It's just like I dreamed...
I'm so glad you like it.
It's so pretty.
How did you do this?
I had some of the boys do some work and we just got it done.
If you put your mind to it, you can do anything.
- What do you think?
- I think it's a miracle.
It's good, right? I told you
I'd finish it. I just needed time.
I'm thinking of starting my own business. What do you think?
That way I could set my own hours.
I don't want to do anything big. l want to start with small projects.
Bird houses and mail boxes.
Stuff like that.
That'd be nice.
I love you so much.
I mean, I just...
I just really love you.
Whatever I do. whatever you need to do...
As long as we're both rowing the same boat we'll be fine.
- Bye, honey!
- See you.
Bye!
Where are you guys headed?
- Wherever the road takes us.
- Maybe Florida. Stop off in Vegas.
We're going to eat a dolphin.
- No, you're going to pet one.
- Right. We'll pet a dolphin.
- Will you be all right?
- We'll be okay.
- We'll be fine. Don't worry.
- How about you? You'll be okay?
I'm going to be fine.
I'll tell you one thing.
You're three good-looking guys.
- When he's right, he's right.
- I guess.
- I'll see you.
- Bye, Doug.
See you, Steve.
If a T. Rex fought with a tank...
Who'd win?
I don't know, honey.
Mom?
You know how to tell you love someone?
When everyone reminds you of them.
Dear Doug.
Greetings from sunny Miami.
We've been open for six months and business is booming.
Two is happy because he gets to meet new people every day.
You know how nice he can be when he wants to.
I'm cooking up a storm and having a ball.
The pizzas are selling like crazy.
People just love my pepperoni.
And you'd be so proud of Four.
He's working two jobs. In the morning he delivers newspapers.
And the rest of the day he delivers pizzas for us.
English subtitles: IFT
This is squad, we got him here.
We have a positive ID. It is the Ripper.
Repeat, it is the Ripper.
This is one hell of a way to spend Christmas.
- Mulcahey!
- Sir.
- Secure the sidewalk. No one in or out.
- Yes, sir.
Got a present for you. Pigs!
Damn you! Let the children go!
Damn you, Ripper! Let the children go!
Slater! Don't even think it, Slater, you hear me?
You're gonna sit and wait for the real hostage negotiator!
God damn it, Jack, I'm talking to you!
The last time you pulled this jive, jitterbug, tough gonad shit, people lost body parts!
Now, you go in there and it's your badge!
Jack! I know, as mayor of this great metropolis, you and I have had our little tiffs, but this is the Lieutenant Governor.
- Slater, here's what I...
- When the governor gets here, call me.
Slater's attempting to enter.
Do not let him in. Repeat, do not let him in.
- Piece of cake.
- Hey.
You want to be a farmer?
Here's a couple of acres.
- Dekker, the next one I'll hurt.
- Slater, don't go in...
Check fire. There's an officer in the building.
I say again, there's a plain-clothes officer in the building!
- Jack, what kept you?
- Dad!
Andy here's been getting nervous.
I promised him you'd come.
Gave him my word of honor he could watch you die.
- Lose the cannon.
- Has he hurt you, Andrew?
Hurt, Jack? You say "hurt"?
What do you know about hurt, Jack?
- You put me in a cage for 10 years.
- You should have gotten the death penalty.
Yeah, would've, should've, could've.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
Things crawling around in your head.
Sitting on my chest when I wake up.
Do you know what that's like, Jack?
It was your illegal search that rendered the bloody ax inadmissible.
Remember, Jack? Now lose the gun.
All right, I'm unarmed. So let the boy go.
Just one gun, Jack? You got to be kidding.
- Is that all, sport?
- Yep, that about does it.
Then step away.
Chop-chop.
Oh, unless you consider this a weapon.
Brilliant, Jack. Brilliant. I surrender.
- It's a live grenade.
- Yeah, right, Jack. Right, right.
You're going to sacrifice your own child to get to me.
I'm very flattered, Jack, but I doubt it.
Andy, pick up the grenade. Go on.
Show it to me. That's good. Right there.
Jack, that toy can't hurt the boy, but this one can.
Focus!
Hey, come on! Focus!
- Hey, people are trying to sleep.
- Yeah, right.
The film is out of focus.
The film is out... Never mind.
Nick!
Nick.
Nick?
Nick, you okay?
- What?
- The climax is on the fritz.
All right. All right.
I never used to do that, Danny.
It's okay.
I've seen this Slater six times.
I just got worried.
You know, the new Jack Slater opens this weekend at the Odyssey.
Like I didn't know that.
"They killed his second cousin.
Big mistake."
"Jack Slater IV."
Well, I'm checking the print tonight, midnight. Just myself.
I could arrange for you to gain admittance, that is, you know, if that sort of thing appeals to you.
- See it before it opens?
- Yeah.
- Who do I have to kill?
- Nobody. All you have to do is get to school.
You know, if you hurry, you're only going to be four hours late.
Treachery, conspiracy, sex, sword fights, madness, ghosts.
And in the end, everybody dies.
Shakespeare's Hamlet couldn't be more exciting.
And though it may seem that he is incapable of taking any action, he is, in fact, one of the first action heroes.
What you are going to see is a scene from the film by Laurence Olivier.
Some of you might have seen him in the Polaroid commercial, or as Zeus in Clash ofthe Titans.
O, bosom, black as death!
Help, angels!
All may yet be well.
Now he's praying, and now I'll do it.
And so he goes to heaven.
Don't talk. Just do it.
Hey, Claudius.
You killed my father.
Big mistake.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and Hamlet is taking out the trash.
- Stay thy hand, fair prince.
- Who said I'm fair?
No one's going to tell this sweet prince,
"Good night."
To be or not to be.
Not to be.
The whole morning? He wasn't.
No, I said, "He wasn't."
He wasn't at school today.
He's sick as a lamb, poor dog.
Regale me with the story of your life starting this morning, 8:30, first period,
American history and make this really good.
I mean something along the lines of,
"I cut so I could donate a kidney."
You were at the movies again, weren't you?
And that crazy old guy is an accessory.
- Nick's not crazy.
- Damn it, Danny!
You know, I'm in there, lying to a principal, me, a charter member of the PTA.
And what for? So you can go to the movies?
Sorry.
I didn't choose any of this. I didn't choose it.
I didn't say, "Hey, what the hell,
"let me see what it would be like to be a widow before I'm 40, give that a try."
- I know that.
- Give me a hug.
- I won't cut again.
- Let me hear the "p" word on that.
- Promise.
- All right.
Oh, Jesus! I'm late. I got to get to work.
All right.
Lock the top lock the minute I close the door, okay?
And do not open this door for anyone.
- Bye.
- Bye.
She called her mother in and they're trying to do something about it.
They had cereal bugs.
I can't wait to see the new...
...continue to be a big problem...
Come here often?
Ron Rice for one reason.
What you eating?
Nothing, maggots.
You alone? Okay. Move it!
Do yourself to the drain.
Tough guy.
Do it. I'll make it easier for you.
Go ahead.
Do it.
What is it with you? You got junk!
No jewelry, no VCR.
A shit TV that will get me 20 bucks.
Go fish, amigo.
Remember now, your mom says you're to go straight home.
- She'll be there when the shift is over.
- Yes, sir.
If we find the guy, I'll give you a call.
Nick!
Come on.
- I about gave up on you.
- Sorry.
- Well, what do you think?
- Well, I've never seen anything like it.
- It's not too tight, is it?
- No, no. It's... It's the style.
I always wanted to be a magician, but my hands, they were just too tiny.
My father, he was bookkeeper here and he got me my first job.
Usher. It was still a vaudeville house.
Then I worked myself up to projectionist.
It's not much, but it's still show biz.
So... Is the print ready to roll?
Just a minute, young man.
Aren't we forgetting something?
A ticket.
You got to have a ticket, Danny, to see a movie, and have I got just the one.
See, when I was about your age,
Harry Houdini played this theater and my pop took me backstage to see him after the show.
And he made a gesture, Houdini did.
Like this.
And all of a sudden, this was in his hand.
And he said to me, he whispered, he said, "This is a magic ticket.
"It was given to me by the best magician in India,
"and it was given to him by the best magician in Tibet.
"It's a passport to another world.
"It was mine, and now it's yours."
And now it's yours.
What does it do, Nick?
I never had the courage to find out.
I had the ticket for years and I wanted to try, but I guess I was afraid it wouldn't work.
See, when I was your age,
Houdini was like a god to me.
But what if he was faking?
And then again, what if it did work?
Yeah, well, what if it did?
Well, Houdini said something else to me.
He said, "This ticket has a mind of its own.
"It does what it wants to do."
And that always made me just a little edgy.
Well, I guess there's only one way to find out, then, right?
Please retain your stub, sir.
Shall we see if Mr. Slater wins this time?
Jack Slater can't lose!
Never has, never will.
Oh, Frankie.
Frank. Frankie.
Frankie, why you keep on with the insults?
- I would never insult you, Mr. Vivaldi.
- When you lie, that's an insult.
I know you're Jack Slater's favorite second cousin in the whole world.
You all the time talk to each other.
I got to know what Slater knows, and you are going to tell me, huh?
Does he know that my mob and Torelli's mob have just signed a secret pact to control...
To control all the drugs in Southern California?
We mostly talk muzzle velocities.
Guns.
Meet Mr. Benedict.
The genuine article.
And, you'd better believe it.
Sometimes, he likes to bake while he's shooting people.
What I'm saying is Mr. Benedict can take you out as easy as cake.
Pie, you Sicilian schmuck.
The man is a surgeon.
You want me to make him operate on you?
I swear, I don't know.
Dump him at his place, huh?
But take it easy.
He bought it.
He actually believes me and old man Torelli are banding together.
Beauty part is, nobody knows different.
Not till after the funeral.
Then everybody knows.
Everybody knows Tony Vivaldi is number one.
You are going to pay.
Oh, are you going to pay.
Are you sure this is the right address?
This don't look like no crack house to me.
What do you want?
Sixty guys dancing on the lawn, throwing cocaine at each other?
Just kick the door in.
What's up, guys?
- Quiet. This is a drug bust.
- A drug bust?
You must be joking.
My second cousin Frank lives in there.
The only drugs you'll find in there are aspirin.
And if you touch that front door, you're going to need them.
Maybe there's been a mistake.
We received an anonymous tip.
Frank? Frank? Frank?
Frank?
- Frank.
- Jack...
Jack, listen to me.
- Who did this?
- Listen to me. This is important.
Tony Vivaldi and the Torelli mob are joining forces.
I'm out of here.
Frank. Frank!
I'm sorry, Frank.
It's a bomb!
He's okay. Minor wound. Both cops dead.
Two days to retirement.
Nick? Hello?
Nick!
Who the hell are you?
Don't shoot me.
I'm Danny Madigan, I'm a kid.
How did you get here?
I'm not quite sure where "here" is, sir, but I don't think you want to know.
Okay, close your eyes, stay flat and don't move.
You're driving with no hands.
You think it's easy?
You have to practice a lot and never ever do it in heavy traffic.
Iced that guy. To "cone" a phrase.
Wait a minute. The bad puns, the voice, the hard rock.
This is happening.
This is really happening.
This is not happening.
Repeat, this is not hap...
Oh, no!
I booted. Sorry.
I thought I was going to die.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you're going to live to enjoy all the glorious fruits life has to offer, acne, shaving, premature ejaculation and your first divorce.
Boy, does this suck weenie or what?
This is a movie set.
This is a movie set.
That's how the scenery changed, right?
You're going to play chicken, aren't you?
Just like Jack Slater.
Fasten your seat belt, please.
Your fingers?
Cross as many as you can.
I'm in the movie.
Holy cow, I'm in the movie!
Nick, Houdini wasn't faking.
Jack, did you see that?
I was just in a real police station and this is much nicer.
Hey, Slater, it's your ex-wife on two.
You stay. She's always calling me.
Hello, sweetheart, how are you?
It's so nice to hear your voice.
- Oiler, you're partnered up with Waterman.
- Give me a partner, Sarge.
That is right.
Yep. Of course. No, just as you say.
Yep.
Krause, you're teamed up with the rabbi.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
- Practice!
John Practice, you old SOB.
What are you doing away from Washington?
The bureau thinks something strange is going on between...
And this is top secret...
I know. The Vivaldi mob is joining forces with the Torellis.
Damn it, Jack, how do you do that?
Well, I'm not parked behind a desk all day eating those donuts.
Those are government donuts, my friend.
It's not easy work. I got to call DC.
Good for you.
Watch it, Jack. He killed Mozart.
- In a movie?
- Amadeus. It won eight Oscars.
I saved his life in Nam.
I'll make sure to be on the lookout. Thanks.
Now, no more movies!
Slater!
I got the city council chewing my eggs off for that plane you crashed!
I got the mayor scheduling parades, up my Lincoln tunnel for that stunt you pulled on the beach!
Everybody wants to know, what it is, what it ain't and what it will be!
- Do I make myself clear?
- I'm just doing my job.
You've given this department the worst reputation in the country.
Now I've got the Chamber of Commerce doing cartwheels in my cocoa factory.
Radcliff, you're pulling duty with the animated cat.
Hiya, toots.
- I'm getting a flea bath later. Join me?
- You touch me again, fur ball...
- Wait! I can prove this is a movie.
- Who the hell are you, kid?
Look out there, there's a cartoon cat.
He's supposed to be back on duty.
He was only suspended for a month.
Now, shut up.
Listen to what I'm saying.
An animated cat just walked into the squad room. Hello.
He'll do it again tomorrow.
So what's your point?
- That cat is one of the best men I got!
- Yeah.
Now who is this twerp?
And why is that smile on his face?
I just love the way you two fight, knowing how you really feel about each other.
Pray tell, just how do I feel about this weird-looking sack of puppy poop?
You're dearest friends.
After your wife left you for the circus midget and Jack told everyone he drove her to
New England to the diphtheria clinic.
When he came back, you said,
"You saved me from public humiliation,
Jack.
"You're my dearest friend."
- And you promised me you wouldn't tell.
- I didn't.
- Then how did he know?
- Jack Slater I.
- What's winning got to do with this?
- No! The very first Jack Slater.
You told your dad?
I didn't tell anyone.
I don't even know this kid.
Well, he seems to know a lot about us.
No such number. No such name.
The state of New York's never heard of you,
Mr. Madigan.
- What's your real name?
- Danny Madigan.
- Where are you really from?
- How did you get in the car?
- I...
I fell off a walk over a bridge.
Slipped into your car.
He saved my life.
Truth at last. Now, why were they after you?
My second cousin Frank found out some crucial drug information.
I wouldn't put too much faith into what Vivaldi told him.
- How do you know Frank mentioned Vivaldi?
- I know a lot about what's going on.
Now if you will just listen to me...
All right, son,
I've got the perfect listener for you.
- Meet your new partner.
- Oh, no.
Better to die.
You're going to love it, Jack. I mean, we're perfect buddy-movie material.
I'll teach you to be vulnerable, you'll teach me to be brave.
Hi. I'm Jack Slater's new partner.
Jack and I will be working together for the duration of the film.
You know I'm right.
If this was the real world, I mean, they wouldn't make me your partner.
They'd assign me to a social worker.
Here's one.
Tell me how I know they tortured Frank and then stashed him behind his front door.
Because I saw it all on screen, because this is a movie.
You're very clever. And the only reason why I'm not roaring with laughter is because someone killed my favorite second cousin and that's a...
Big mistake.
That is what you were going to say, right?
- Gee, how would I know that?
- No one likes a smart-ass.
Okay. Then shoot me.
That's right. Take your gun, point it at my head and pull the trigger.
Come on, do it. I double dare you.
You're not going to do it, are you?
And do you know why?
Because people like you don't kill kids in movies.
Because, believe it or not,
Jack, you're the good guy.
You really believe that we're inside a movie, don't you?
- Yes!
- All right.
I'll give you 10 minutes to prove it and then I shoot you.
Slater!
- Quick, where are the Schwarzenegger films?
- Foreign films are in the back.
- No, action. This guy's an action star.
- Down the center on the left.
No. It isn't possible.
What's not possible? He's fantastic.
This is his best performance ever.
- But that was you. You were in that movie.
- You were in a movie?
Yes. It was called The Girl ofMy Dreams.
It starred you.
As a matter of fact, we had this very romantic scene together.
- What's the phone number of this store?
Okay. What's your home number?
That's okay. You can give it to him.
I'm a police officer.
- Amazing.
I'm willing to bet that everyone has a 555 number.
- So?
- So...
There can only be 9,999 numbers that start with 555.
- How many people live in LA?
- Eight or nine million.
That's why we have area codes.
- Is this your kid?
- This? Oh, no.
This is a mental patient and I'm going to take him downtown. Come on.
Okay, I got one.
What about this girl right here?
She is way too attractive to be working at a video store.
I agree with you.
I think she should be working with us.
Undercover, of course.
Look, the point is there are no unattractive women here.
I mean, where are the ordinary, every-day women?
- They don't exist, because this is a movie.
- No. This is California.
And by the way, thanks.
I think it was really slick, the way you got this girl's phone number.
Okay, Mr. Non-believer.
I'll take you to the house where your cousin Frank was tortured.
I've seen it, on screen.
It's kind of like that one, except it's got to be on the other side of the road
'cause it's got an ocean view.
Listen, there's something you don't understand.
This ticket is magic, and it really works.
Any second we're going to drive right into a theater.
Maybe I need to warm it up first.
Of course. My decoder ring has to warm up, too. All the time.
Okay, okay. The house looked European.
Like maybe you get a postcard from Italy or something.
Like that one. In fact, just like that one.
The bad guys are in there.
You know something?
I think you should be wearing this.
- I don't think I've earned it yet.
- You don't understand.
You just solved the entire case.
You just revolutionized the entire history of police training.
I mean, all these years at the academy, studying human character, psyche of the terrorist, fingerprint analysis.
All the courses that I've taken in surveillance, hostage negotiation and criminal psychology...
When all I had to do is just drive around the neighborhood and point my finger at the house and say,
"The bad guys are in there."
- You think you're funny, don't you?
- I know I am.
I'm the famous comedian,
Arnold Braunschweiger.
- Schwarzenegger.
- Gesundheit.
May I help you?
Yes. Could I speak to the drug dealer of the house please?
I beg your pardon?
It's a beautiful day and we're out killing drug dealers.
Are there any in the house?
Be ready for anything.
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'll be back.
You didn't know I was going to say that, did you?
- That's what you always say.
- I do?
Everybody keeps waiting for you to work it in.
It's kind of like your calling card.
I understand you're interested in drug dealers.
Yes.
Jack, that's him, the henchman with the glass eye.
Sir, are you a henchman?
No. I only go as far as lackey.
Will there be anything else?
Yeah. Take off your sunglasses.
- Who's asking?
- The tin man.
- Well, tin man, suppose you hit the bricks.
- No. They're the wrong color.
Are they? Oh, dear. By all means, let's change them. Would arterial red suit you?
Make no mistake.
They are exceptionally well-trained.
I snap my fingers again, and some time tomorrow you emerge from several canine recta.
Or you and Toto can go back to the land of Oz.
- Questions?
- Yeah.
Two of them.
Why am I wasting time on a dime store putz like you when I could be doing something much more dangerous?
Like rearranging my sock drawers.
And two, how exactly are you going to snap your fingers after I rip off both of your thumbs?
Have a nice day.
He had one with a bull's-eye when he was with your second cousin.
He hates his boss.
He calls him a Sicilian schmuck.
How did Slater find out? Will you tell me?
I want him to join me, but he's nuts.
He keeps going after the bad guys.
Where is it written I'm a bad guy?
Find out who talked and have him killed.
Then, Slater.
Hey. Hey!
What's with you?
We should change the funeral arrangements.
Are you crazy?
When I say bloodbath, there is
- a bloodbath.
- A bloodbath.
I'm going to find out more about Slater's short friend.
Come on, Jack.
That guy has got to be guilty of something.
Yeah. He's guilty of acting like an asshole.
If I arrest him,
I have to arrest half of Congress.
Why did we park back there?
In case my ex-wife is around.
Don't worry, she's not.
Her name wasn't in the credits.
Kid, who does the doctor treat?
Patients.
Look at the elbow of my jacket.
What is it doing?
- Wearing thin?
- Bingo.
Geez, that was a stretch.
Wow! Is this what you drive on the weekends?
No, this is my little girl's car.
Come on. Knock on the door.
I told you, your ex-wife's not home.
Her name wasn't in the credits.
Meredith?
I hope you mean Whitney.
Sorry. Whitney.
You're not Skeezy, are you?
Daddy! Oh, my God.
- Daddy!
- You've gained some weight.
Hi. I'm Danny Madigan and I realize I haven't had that long of a life, but I just want you to know that from now on, it's all going to be downhill.
- Hello, sweetheart, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.
So, who's your friend? He's cute.
No, he's not cute, he's hopelessly insane.
Very soon he's gonna tell you he loved you in Gone with the Wind.
- This is her first movie.
- You see?
- Now who is Skeezy?
- It's just a sorority thing, Dad. What they do is they assign you a freshman, and when he comes to the door, you kiss him.
- Do you have to kiss him?
- Dad, would you come on?
Okay, would you grab the phone and if it's for me, I'll be out of the shower in less than one hour for sure.
What a cutie.
It's old evidence. Counterfeit case.
Looks real, doesn't it?
Turns funny colors when you burn it.
Try using it for alimony.
What's wrong?
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?
"I'll be back." I know, I know.
Dad! Dad!
He would have been your age.
I know.
The Ripper killed him three years ago.
Pulled him down off the roof.
Your dad saw everything.
How did you know all that?
Your pop gets in the papers a lot.
I'm interested in crime stories.
- That's Skeezy.
- I'll get rid of him.
Hello, Toto.
There, there, and there.
No! Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Stop it!
- Evening. Uncle Jack around?
Mr. Slater's off tracking a lead somewhere.
Joey, would you teach her the virtue of silence?
- Right.
- Benedict.
- If you harm a hair on her head...
- Stop!
Go away! Stop it! No!
You were saying?
Now, I believe it was Sherlock Holmes who said that if you eliminate all the logical solutions to a problem, the illogical, however impossible, is invariably true.
You see, I know that your name is Daniel Madigan.
What I don't understand is how you know mine.
Slater showed me some mug shots.
We made your face easy.
Daniel Madigan from New York City.
Awfully long way away from home, aren't you? When did you get here?
Just.
And how do you know what I said on Vivaldi's terrace?
I heard a recording.
Microphones in the statues, are there?
You wouldn't believe how many.
And the eye I was wearing?
I saw it. I saw it in a movie.
There are micro cameras in the statues.
I should tell you that I have killed people smarter and younger than you.
Look, whatever this is, it's between you and Slater.
There's some money in the desk.
Take it and leave me and Meredith...
Whitney alone.
Holy shit, boss.
It looks like 2K in here.
Just a minute.
Give it to me.
These bills are marked, aren't they?
You were trying to sucker me with marked bills, weren't you?
Burn it.
- Burn it?
- Yes, burn it.
Don't play games with grownups, little boy.
You'll get hurt.
Stop it! Stop it! Oh, God.
Big mistake.
It's great, isn't it?
Now, we'll hurt you just a little bit, but you'll...
Freeze!
Lose the guns or I redecorate in brain-matter gray, got it?
Yes!
You kill me and I'll kill him.
Leave it. Get the door.
Boss?
Hi.
Don't give up your day job.
Jack!
Don't leave home without it.
Go!
Where are you going?
Got to catch the red-eye.
I don't believe this. I'm in the movie, and...
I'm in the movie, and I'm missing the best action!
Punch it. Let's get the hell out of here.
Go back up to the top!
Next time, we get thicker armor.
Like a tank.
Chicken, it is.
This is gonna work. It's a movie.
I'm a good guy. This has got to work!
I'm a comedy sidekick.
Oh, shit! I'm a comedy sidekick!
It's not gonna work!
Well, I think I scared him pretty good.
You did great. Come on.
- Benedict's got the ticket.
- That's too bad.
I wanted it for my collection.
I told you, Blanche isn't here.
She won't be back for two hours.
I know. I'm gonna wait for her.
It is a shame. It's so romantic.
Well, I'll never get any work done if I stay here and think about that.
I'll run with Jane to the store.
What a shame. Two tickets to Hawaii.
Oh, I've gotta get her a husband.
Maybe Blanche can help out.
We'll be right back after this commercial announcement.
You know, if you're looking for a new or used car, see me first.
Give me first crack at the deal.
I'll beat anybody else's deal.
I'd gargle anti-freeze to beat anybody else's deal.
So see me first, give me first shot.
Now here's a nice car.
Seventy-three, this is a Landau, top power steering, power brakes, air conditioning. $999.
If you're looking for trucks, we got trucks.
We got all kinds of trucks. '79 pickup, $2,999.
Here's another one. This is a Long Bed.
This is $3,999. Can't beat that.
Give me first shot...
You're traveling through another dimension.
My name is Skeezy. S-K-E-E-Z-Y, sir.
S-K-E...No I-E. Thank you.
Say this.
Hey, grow up.
Just say this one word.
Is this another one of your movie proofs?
Maybe.
Kid, I don't want to say it.
Say what?
You can't. You can't possibly say it because this movie is PG-13. Admit it.
Officer Slater, the guy with the missing eye,
I saw his license plate.
Well, good for you.
- You mean the guy with the glass eye?
- No.
When he was running for the car, it was missing.
It's got words.
"Vengeance is..."
Don't touch!
You flipped up on all of it!
God damn it, that's all I can take from you!
I got the California Raisin Counsel doing an all-male version of The Diary of Anne Frank, doing an all-male version in my fuzzy slipper!
Tiny Tim is tiptoeing through the tulips!
- Did you catch that?
- You ball-peen jack-a-menace.
I slurped about all the cock-sucking toast
I can take from you!
You know you...
I think some of it's English.
Well, see if this is clear enough!
Give me your badge!
And this time, you won't get it back.
Wohlschlager, you're partnered up with the black-and-white digitalization of Humphrey Bogart.
What, are you making some changes?
Come on, why don't you come and work the funeral with me, anyway?
I mean, I don't know, I wouldn't miss this one. I hear Torelli spent a bundle.
He's got a damn helicopter circling the building.
A rooftop funeral service in Long Beach.
How's that for taste?
Who died?
Leo the Fart was shot yesterday.
Somebody was trying for Torelli and missed.
Leo was tough.
He could do everything but sneak up on you.
Look, look, if you change your mind,
I'll be in front of the hotel.
- Where are we, anyway?
- Home.
Geez!
How did you know there was a guy in there?
There's always a guy in there.
Costs me a fortune in closet doors.
Right. Like in Slater, Part Il:
The Sagittarius Strangler.
Yeah, in a few seconds, you're gonna meet the Madigan strangler.
I just got fired.
What you find so entertaining happens to be my life.
Now I'm not even a cop anymore.
You'll get your badge back.
He was just pulling rank because you destroyed more of the city than usual.
Jack, you're not just my hero, you're everybody's hero.
And it will all be okay again. Trust me.
No, Danny. It's getting harder.
I never started out to be anything but a decent cop, but I kept getting involved in these crazy adventures.
But the craziest part is, I kept surviving.
Jack, these are the sequels.
They gotta get harder.
But look on the good side.
I mean, you've got a great daughter.
And your ex-wife wouldn't keep calling if somewhere deep down she didn't want you back.
Danny, do you think I would marry someone so stupid that doesn't know the real voice from a taped one?
I pay a cashier at the drugstore to call me every so often at the station so the guys think I have a private life.
My ex-wife, she's happily remarried.
She never calls.
And Whitney.
Why can she not be like every other teenager?
On prom night, she stays home and field strips an AK-47.
She's going to die a young maid. I know it.
I'm going to buy it soon, too.
No way.
You can't die till the grosses go down.
That guy Vivaldi,
I heard him say something was going to happen at a funeral.
Now this Leo the Fart is going to have one.
Maybe we should look into that.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.
Jack, it's a funeral for a guy named Fart.
Hello?
Funeral?
Check this out.
Someone tried to kill old man Torelli, right?
Missed and shot Leo the Fart by mistake.
- Right.
- Wrong.
Who took the shot? Was it Benedict?
Most likely.
Would he miss? No way.
Unless he wanted to miss.
You're saying he meant to miss?
Why?
Because, amigo,
Leo the Fart was very, very fat.
- Get it?
- No, I don't.
They broke in last night.
They cut Leo open like a turkey, stuffed him with TNT, he goes off at the funeral and takes out the entire Torelli mob, all at once.
Vivaldi owns the town.
That's what all this has been about.
Vivaldi's going to blow up that funeral.
No. No. It wouldn't just be a bomb.
I mean, we've already had a dozen explosions in this movie.
Danny, don't start that again.
- Nerve gas!
- What are you talking about?
Three canisters of nerve gas were stolen from military trucks the night before last.
They could have stuffed those inside him.
And you know what that means, don't you?
Leo the Fart is going to pass gas one more time.
Mr. Torelli,
I hope it's all right with you I am here.
- I don't want to be no fourth wheel.
- Nonsense, Antonio...
Fifth wheel.
That's nice. Thank you, thank you.
Did you hear that, Benedict?
Family.
Go pay your respects, huh?
- Stay in the car.
- No way. I'm coming with you.
Kid, let's say this is a movie.
How many times have you heard someone say, "Stay in the car" and the guy doesn't?
What happens?
- He saves the day.
- Or gets killed.
Good point. I'll stay in the car.
Wait a minute! What if staying in the car is what gets me killed?
There's a gun in the glove compartment.
- Practice!
- Makes perfect.
- You decided to join me, huh?
- The Fart is a bomb.
They're going to take out the whole
Torelli mob. We've got to stop it.
That explains the break-in at the mortuary.
Geez, that's brilliant.
Come on.
We'll use the service entrance in back.
- Who are you working for, John?
- What do you mean?
We both know there's no side entrance to this hotel.
Sorry, Jack.
I didn't want it to go down this way.
Danny told me not to trust you.
He said you killed Moe Zart.
- Moe, who?
- Zart.
I kill a lot of people.
I can't remember half of them.
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
In a body bag, if you don't drop that.
That's doubtful, kid.
Real doubtful.
Thanks for the fingerprints, kid.
You're about to murder Jack Slater.
Here. Chain yourself to that pipe.
See, Jack, these drug guys, they got more money than the U.S. Government.
So you cut a deal with a Sicilian scumbag like Vivaldi.
Right you are.
You see, Vivaldi made up with Torelli, but it was a phony.
He's going to destroy him.
So, in exchange for letting him alone, he gives me a profit percentage.
I'll be rich, Jack.
- You'll be dead, but...
- Freeze!
Toss me the cuffs.
Man, are you an idiot!
You made the classic movie mistake.
Don't explain so much.
You had to get in those last few words.
I mean, if you had just fired, you would have won.
But, no, you're the typical villain. Dumb.
You ain't no genius yourself, kid.
- The Fart goes off in seven minutes.
- Get my car.
Move it.
Well, I'd love to stay and watch the fun, but I have to go and establish my alibi.
So, is this the day you were talking about saving?
- I don't see you doing anything.
- I wouldn't want to steal your thunder.
No, no, no.
You stay here and make sure everything goes on as planned.
You had Slater in front of the eight ball before, but you always screwed it up.
All right. Let's go.
It's behind the eight ball, you moron.
Somebody once told me I talk too much.
No more words.
Whiskers! Where the hell have you been?
Sorry, Jack. Fur ball problem.
Seal off the area. There's a possible chemical explosion in five minutes.
- Thanks, Whiskers. I owe you one.
- Forget it. You saved my fur plenty of times.
You see the hook of that crane?
I want it on top of the roof in two minutes. Go.
Wait. How do I get them to do that?
You got to help me move that crane!
You got to help me!
- I got to get that crane to the roof.
- Shit.
Hey, wait a minute!
You got to work this thing!
I don't even know how to drive.
- Pardon me. Excuse me.
- Hey!
Pardon me.
He was a good man. A flatulent man.
Do you hear this?
Help me. Get me out of here.
My God! This man's not dead!
Get out of the way! This man needs a doctor!
Out of my way.
- This man needs a doctor!
- I'm a doctor.
- You're a doctor?
- Yes.
Check his chin.
The doctor has fainted.
Can somebody help this man here?
I'll take the corpse... I mean, the patient.
Look, an elephant.
Hold it! Don't shoot! He'll drop Leo!
Don't shoot!
Oh, shit!
Watch out!
It's a no-fly zone, fella.
Shit!
Danny! He's ticking!
Move the crane as fast as you can!
Danny! Stop the crane now! Stop it!
Drop! Go! Go! Go! Go! Damn you! Go!
Gas bag, drop! Damn you! Drop!
Drop! Gas bag, drop!
Get out of here! Everybody out!
Silent, but deadly.
Bring the car around.
Can't. The helicopter landed on it.
I hate when that happens.
You know, tar actually sticks to some people.
Hey, Dad! I heard you were here.
I thought you could use some clothes.
- Thanks, honey.
- Wait a minute.
No one finds this a little convenient?
Hey, kid, you always said this is a movie, didn't you?
How did it go?
Hey! How did it go?
Come on. I'm dying out here.
How was it? I want to know how it went.
Come on, move your butt.
How did it went?
Splendid.
What?
- It went splendidly!
- Wait, wait a minute. I can't hear you.
I don't want to miss a thing.
Come here. Come here.
- Hey, Benedict, get your stuff.
- Yes.
- Was it beautiful?
- Perfect in every detail.
And the gas tanks. Poof! Were they okay?
Like clockwork.
You should have been there.
Men, women and children dropping left and right, writhing and screaming.
Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
I want to enjoy it all.
Go on, go on. Tell me, tell me.
They were writhing and screaming and leaping to their doom to escape the pain.
- Really? Really?
- No, not really. I'm lying.
It was a complete and utter balls-up and I've had a terrible day, thanks largely to you.
What is this, Benedict?
First, you're my friend. Now you turn a
- 360 on me.
- God.
One-eighty, you stupid, spaghetti-slurping cretin.
One-eighty! If I did a 360,
I'd go completely around and end up back where I started!
- What?
- Trust me.
If that little turd, Daniel Madigan, can move through parallel worlds,
I can move through parallel worlds, in and out.
In, steal whatever I want, and out again.
Impossible to catch.
If God was a villain, he'd be me.
- You want me vacuum now?
- No, thank you.
But the pool could benefit from some attention.
Very good.
Don't move.
- All right, Slater, I'll go quietly.
- The hell you will.
That was for blowing up my second cousin, Frank's house.
And this is for blowing up my ex-wife's house.
But this...
This is for my daughter's black eye!
Usually, when I do that, it leaves a hole.
The ticket. Jack, he's got the ticket!
It's the key to everything. It's magic.
See? That's my world!
He's gone over to my world!
The door, it must still be open. Come on!
I'm not worried that you're crazy anymore.
I'm worried that you're right.
But if I go, how do I get back?
You can't go through life nitpicking every little thing.
Now, come on!
The hell with it.
There was nothing to it.
- We're still here.
- Are you sure about that? Look.
Quickly! Quickly!
- I want to see if Nick's okay.
- There's no time. Come on.
What the hell? We're in New York.
Jack, it all makes sense.
No, actually it makes absolutely no sense, but I'll try to explain it you. Later.
Meantime, please be careful.
Things work different here.
- Get out!
- All right. Don't get feisty.
- The car's a piece ofjunk, anyway.
- Drive, bonehead!
Here's another explosion for your movie, kid.
Not a word. Not one word.
- My hand. It really hurts.
- Things work different here.
You can't smash a car window with your bare hand and not have it hurt.
Thanks for sharing.
You couldn't have told me this earlier?
- I think the taxis are bulletproof.
- Jack, We got to get that ticket back.
No way, Slater. Please. Listen to me.
It won't work, you hear me?
You can't play chicken in real life.
You'll crash!
Out of the car, amigo.
This isn't the movies anymore, Jack.
Here, you have to reload guns...
- Go, Danny! Get out!
- Car crashes can kill you! You hear me?
You are going to die! Jack!
What did I do?
Oh, Christ, please.
Damn it, that hurt.
You're lucky you're still alive, you dumb idiot!
Hey, '89 Mercury Sable, standard driver's-side air bag.
Checker Cab, no air bag. Who is dumb?
Okay, okay. Just make sure they're dead.
- Give me a break. They're dead.
- Just check, will you?
- Look. Dead.
- They always look dead! Like in Die Hard.
The guy's hanging there by his neck and at the end of the movie he comes back.
All right. Make sure to cover me.
I think he's got a windshield wiper.
Maybe he used the ticket.
Maybe it's on all the time now.
What is this place?
Where am I now?
Danny, you got a place I can sit down?
Yeah. Come on.
Nick! Nick!
Danny. Oh, my God.
I was so worried. Are you okay?
Did you see what happened?
No, I slept the sleep of the dead, kid, in here until
I woke up at 2:00 in the morning and I figured you'd gone home.
I wasn't home, Nick. I was in the movie.
I'm getting a little up in years, kid.
Define "in."
Whitney kissed me on the mouth.
I drove one of those great big cranes and dropped Leo the Fart in the La Brea Tar Pits.
I was with Jack Slater every step of the way!
Oh, my God.
The ticket works?
I could have used it all this time and I never used it 'cause I...
I was too frightened.
But it's not too late. I can still go visit
Garbo in Camille.
Jean Harlow. Oh, boy, I had a crush...
Monroe in Bus Stop.
Forgive me for going on like that, sir.
I'm a great admirer of your work, too.
Nick, it isn't who you think.
You mean, it's... Is he...
This is a wonderful moment for me, Mr. Slater.
I've never met a fictional character before.
How new and exciting this must all be for you.
Hey, I just found out I was imaginary.
I mean, how would you feel if you found out that somebody made you up?
Your job, your marriage, your kids.
Oh, yeah.
Let's push his son off the building.
Gives you nightmares the rest of your life.
But you're fictional, so who cares? I'm sorry, but I don't find it so new and exciting to discover that my whole life has been a damn movie.
Well, you're young and impressionable.
You know, there's lots worse things than movies.
There's politicians and wars and forest fires, and famine and plague...
- Sickness, pain, warts, politicians...
- You already mentioned them.
I know I did.
They're twice as bad as anything else.
Most of my life's been movies, too.
Well, showing them.
But that's all over for me now.
The theater's shut. I'm gonna clear out my stuff, and then it's the wrecking ball.
But now, I got another chance.
Could I have the ticket back, please?
Well... We've got this one little
- hiccup.
- What do you mean "hiccup"?
Benedict's here, too, and he's got the ticket.
That madman with the glass eye?
- How the hell are you going to get back?
- That's a good question.
But we wouldn't want to nitpick.
Right, Danny?
Now, you just follow my lead.
Where have you been?
Have you got any idea what time it is?
The police called.
You're not there, you're not here.
Mom, I'm sorry. Okay?
"Okay?"
There are nine million kids out there with guns and that's all you have to say to me, "Okay?"
- Will you get in here?
- Well... Mom, wait.
You know how you always say you wished I had more friends?
Well...
Hello, Mrs. Madigan.
Arnold Braunschweiger.
Sweetheart, want to have a party?
- How old are you?
- Forget it.
No, you get the shoes! Take the shoes!
Come on, we ain't got time. Come on!
Take his shoes?
No screams?
No sirens?
Excuse me!
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
I'm sorry to bother you.
I wonder if you'd help me test a theory.
Sure. What can I do for you?
Well...
Hello?
I've just shot somebody. I did it on purpose!
I said, I have murdered a man, and I want to confess!
Hey, shut up down there!
I don't know what to say.
I feel a little shy and embarrassed right now, but, I mean, I understand that, for some reason, we look alike.
It's crazy...
The thing is, you really do look uncannily like him except for one thing, the eyes.
- You are obviously much more intelligent.
- Thank you.
Good morning. Good afternoon.
Good to see you.
What kind of eggs do you want?
Scrambled.
Have you guys been up all night?
Why didn't you tell me that Jack was a cop and why didn't you tell me you spent the whole night in a police station looking at mug shots?
You could have taken two minutes to call your mother.
Why didn't you tell me you had no friends?
And what is this business about going to the movies at midnight when you knew your mother would be worried?
Mom. You turned him into a wimp.
Oh, I think not. Toast?
No, thanks.
Jack, are you okay?
We talked.
I mean, I never just talked to a woman before. It's neat.
Neat?
Wimp. Next, they'll be talking about sex.
Me and Jack are going out today!
I'm helping him on a case!
Oh, no.
Your license to kill expired at 4:00 this morning, young man.
Get in here and eat some eggs.
Mom, I have to help. I'm the only witness.
You know, like the kid in the movie with Harrison Ford?
There is no comparison.
We're not Jewish.
- Amish.
- Whatever-ish!
Irene. Don't worry. It won't be that hard.
There are eight million in this city.
And I'm very good at catching people.
Yeah! And the future of the world may be at stake, and, and maybe...
Could you turn this up, please?
What's that?
- Mozart.
- The guy Practice killed?
That's right, Jack.
You like classical music?
I don't know. I think I will. Wow.
You tell my mom who you really were?
Yeah, a cop from LA.
I mean, really.
Well, real enough. For right now.
So you think for sure you're going to catch him?
I always catch everybody.
And you're going to spot him from up here?
Hey, give me a break.
It's the first time I've been to anyplace real.
Now, this ticket of yours...
It worked in one movie.
Does that mean that Benedict could use it again?
You mean on other movies?
Why would he want to do that?
I don't know.
But it's a start.
The possibilities are limitless.
But I realized after the car crash that the ultimate freedom would always elude me until Jack Slater was, and forgive the pun, taken out of the picture.
And I thought perhaps you might like to be inclined to help.
Look, I understand that all this must be strange and difficult for you, but if you do this right, the world is your oyster. Trust me.
You can have complete freedom to do whatever you want.
Beyond even your wildest dreams.
And you'll never have to go back to this film again.
Now I know you've never heard of this man, but his actual name, believe it or not, is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Jack, there's got to be a thousand theaters in this city and we've been looking for five hours.
We are that close in catching him.
No, Jack.
We're that close to catching pneumonia.
- Look, in my world, they just leave clues.
- But we're not in your world!
Or they just show up and then kidnap me.
That kind of stuff doesn't happen here, Jack, because this world stinks!
Hey.
The world is what you make of it, Danny.
Now if you want to give up and go home, then go ahead.
You believed in me in the movies.
Why not now?
Because here, you're just...
Just what?
Jack... Jack, there he is!
Jack!
Are you nuts?
- Damn it!
- Hey, you crazy asshole!
Jack, he's just a cabbie!
You've seen those movies where they say,
"Make my day" or "I am your worst nightmare."
Well, listen to this one, rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Ha! You didn't know I'm gonna say that, did you?
- Where did he go? Talk!
- How would I know?
The guy was in the back reading the paper.
You were right, Jack.
He has been going to the movies.
Kid, that ain't the half of it.
Hi, I'm Army Archerd, and we are live to you from New York.
We're just moments away from the world premiere of
Arnold Schwarzenegger's Jack Slater IV.
And here's the man they've come to see, folks. There's no mistaking that car.
Here they are, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his lovely wife, Maria Shriver.
- So good to see you all.
- Are you a big-time fan of Jack Slater films?
I've enjoyed...
It was just beautiful... I just loved it.
The National Enquirer. Don't talk to them.
Okay?
Hi, how are you?
Look, Time magazine. That's great. Hi.
Hi. How are you? Hello.
Now remember, don't plug the restaurants.
I just hate it when you plug the restaurants or the gyms. It's so tacky.
So why was he going to the movies?
Maybe to get help.
Benedict can do damn near anything with the ticket, but we still know who he is.
- So he's got to take us out.
- He can't get to you.
Suppose he doesn't have to get to me.
Suppose all he has to do is get to him.
Benedict is going to kill Schwarzenegger.
- Who's Schwarzenegger, who's Slater.
- Bingo.
We kill less people in this movie.
This movie we only killed 48 people compared to the last one, where we killed 119.
And I want to make sure that the action fans understand we make up for it with a good story, lot of emotions, depth, dimensions...
There are thousands in attendance here tonight.
And millions more are listening to us live around the world.
I'm going to direct it, produce it, and star in it.
- Is this guy a success story, or what?
- It's unbelievable.
Only in America.
Well, only in Hollywood, I would say.
And talking about Hollywood, at Planet Hollywood, we have this incredible memorabilia. Yes, I'm telling you...
Excuse us, we're just gonna get going.
Thanks very much.
...absolutely fabulous. I'm telling you.
You embarrassed me, you low-forehead.
It was humiliating.
How could you do something like that?
Chris, check this out. Look, it's the Ripper from Jack Slater III.
Scary.
Let's "ax" him a question, okay?
See if we can get him over here.
Wow, will you look at this?
A method villain.
Rip, Rip, come here.
What brings you here tonight?
I... I thought I might kill someone.
Maybe you should start with your designer.
Nobody wants to miss out tonight.
The limos just keep coming.
The stars are really shining in Times Square.
Excuse me, sir.
Could I see your invitation?
Pete, it's okay.
He's with me. I'm his agent.
Jesus Christ, Tom, come here.
My goodness, it's Tom Noonan, of course, the actor who played the Ripper.
Who plays the Rip...
What?
What are you, nuts? You want to play ax killers the rest of your life?
Honey, honey, come here.
I'm gonna need the manager's office for about five, 10 minutes.
- I'm sorry, sir...
- You're sorry? Here's 50 bucks.
How sorry are you now?
What do you think
Jack Slater says about America?
I really want to hear it.
I don't really want to hear it.
I'm not really a big fan ofArnold's but she is, you know.
Arnold really turns her on and I just want to be there when it happens, that's all.
Good, Tom, you got the props, too.
That's terrific.
Why don't you just whip a hibachi out from under your coat there?
And we could make some shish kebabs for the critics. That'd be good.
You're lucky I have a friend who rents tuxedos.
Hello. Yeah. I know it's late. Tell him it's me.
Did Nicholson show up to the premiere of Batman dressed as the Joker?
I don't think so.
Hi, Murray, get me your brother-in-law, will you?
Yes, it's important.
It fits nice. Moving the button was a good idea. Just get...
Hey, Marv. Yeah, I need a tux.
- What the hell was that?
- Hey! Watch it!
You're a big action guy.
What do you think about this?
I would never miss the premiere for a second.
Where am I sitting? Where?
Where am I sitting?
There's two balconies.
I believe you're in the upper...
Lower balcony.
- You stay here...
- Yeah, I know. I stay here.
And be careful.
Somebody should be checking that other balcony. Definitely!
Arnold, look. Deal's done, right?
- What?
- Slater V, the soundtrack.
I'll be a son of a...
Jack!
Jack! It's the Ripper!
He's brought back the Ripper!
Jack, Benedict's brought back the Ripper!
Everybody down! Now!
Get off me!
Get the hell off me.
The studio should let me know when they're planning a stunt.
You know, you are the best celebrity look-alike I've ever seen.
Why not?
Hey, if you get to Los Angeles, call my office.
We can get you shopping center openings...
Look, I don't really like you. All right?
You've brought me nothing but pain.
Jack, help!
Did anyone come out of here?
Did you see anyone come out here?
Did you see a crazy guy with an ax coming out of here?
No, no. I didn't.
Hey, Jack. What kept you?
Are you all right, Danny?
Yes... Yes, sir.
You know, I tried to change, Jack.
I really tried to do what he told me to do, but you know, I kept hearing that old music.
That's how I knew you'd come here, Jack.
Now, lose the piece.
There.
It's now between you and me, so let the boy go.
Hey, we've played this number before, haven't we, Jack?
Let's see, what comes next?
You throw the gun away, right?
We did that part and...
And then you tell me to let the kid go and...
I'm getting bored.
Why don't we just skip to the end?
Come on, Jack! Come on.
Over here, right here, Jack. Come on.
Right here.
Come on, Jack! Let's go, man.
Come here, Jack. Come on, Jack.
Let's go, let's go. Come on. Let's do it, Jack.
I'll be back!
The hell you will.
Jack!
- Danny?
- Jack, please!
Danny!
Danny! I'll be right there.
I'm coming! Hang on!
Just hang on now.
- Jack, help!
- Hold on, Danny! I'll be right there.
I'm coming.
Jack, hurry!
Hold on, Danny, and don't look down!
Oh, God, please, don't let him die.
Now, listen, kid.
You grab my hand, and we get out of here.
I can't, Jack. We'll fall.
Come on, now. Danny, trust me.
I can't do it, Jack.
Listen to me, Danny. Listen to me.
You hold on with your feet, with your legs and you let your hands go and I will catch you. Okay? Believe in me.
I will catch you. Now, get my hand. Let's go.
Go for it, now. Come on, Danny. Yes.
This hero stuff has its limits.
I need a hospital.
I think my shoulder is out of the socket.
Will the morgue suffice?
Get down, Danny.
Give it up, Benedict.
The whole lobby is swarming with cops.
I think I can manage to avoid them, but if not,
I've another little explosive surprise for them.
Gentlemen, since you're about to die anyway,
I may as well tell you the entire plot.
Think of villains, Jack.
You want Dracula? Dracula? Hang on.
I'll fetch him. Dracula. I can get King Kong.
We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger.
Have a surprise party for Adolf Hitler.
Hannibal Lecter can do the catering.
And then we'll all have a christening for Rosemary's baby.
All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here.
They're lining up to get here, and do you know why, Jack?
Shall I tell you why?
Because here in this world, the bad guys can win.
I shall miss you, Jack.
Gee, did you make a movie mistake!
You forgot to reload the damn gun.
No, Jack. I just left one chamber empty.
Son of a...
My arm! You broke my arm!
You see, Jack, bad guys can win.
Jack!
Now!
No sequel for you.
The ticket.
Take him home.
Take him back to where this is just a flesh wound.
Don't you understand?
We got to get him back to the movies.
I said turn around.
Great! Just great!
They always run away.
Hang on, Jack.
Danny, do you know how to drive?
Sure. I watched you, didn't I?
Get out of the way!
Nick, fire up the projector. Hurry!
- Slater's dying.
- What happened?
- You got the ticket?
- No, but it's got to work, anyway. It's got to!
Just hold on, Jack. You'll make it.
This is gonna work.
It's got to be here, Jack.
Please, please.
Nick, hurry! The door won't open.
No sweat, kid. You tried.
It's got to be here.
Just hold...
Where do you think you're going?
Back off. You can't have him.
I've had it up to here with you, Mister.
Who stays, who goes...
Well, I'm telling you this one stays.
I was only curious.
He's not on any of my lists.
Though you are, Daniel.
Now?
Oh, no.
You die a grandfather.
Hey, wait a minute. Help us.
You got to get him back.
You can do it. I know you can.
I don't do fiction. Not my field. Sorry.
You are a very brave young man.
Unfortunately, you're not very bright.
If I were you...
I might be looking for the other half of the ticket.
They're all gold. They're all gold.
Yes!
I've got it, Jack. I'll get you home, you'll see.
You can't die.
I know. Not until the grosses go down.
No. This is going to save us.
Throw that silly thing away.
Holy cow!
Let's hear it for Houdini!
Slater!
Damn it. Anybody seen Slater?
You see Slater, you tell him to get in my office right now.
Help, somebody!
They got Jack! Doctor! Hey, doc! Move!
Here, take this. You've got to get back before it changes its mind.
No way. I'm not going to leave you.
I'm just an imaginary hero, Danny.
You have a real life.
You're real to me. Don't you get it?
You're the best thing in... I need you to...
To be here where you can always find me but I need you to be out there.
To believe in me.
Doctor, doctor!
I need you to take care of your mother for me
'cause... Oh, I would love to...
You have your whole life ahead of you.
And pimples and premature ejaculation.
I heard.
- What?
- It's just...
I'm scared I'm never going to see you again.
Whoever thinks that, will be making a big mistake.
Get out of the way. Out of the way.
You want a doctor? I'm a doctor.
Get out of the way.
I'm a doctor. Get out of the way.
- What happened? What happened, pal?
- What is it, doc?
What is this, some kind of a joke?
I wouldn't even call this a flesh wound.
Come on, here, let's get him up.
Damn it, where the hell have you been?
Ha. It's working again.
And you know the cost of that door is coming right out of your meager but undeserved paycheck on account of
I got the Save-The-Eagle foundation doing a fucking tango up and down my Hershey Highway!
Put a sock in it.
I don't care who does what to your Hershey Highway, and stop shouting. I'm not deaf.
You know why you're shouting?
Because it's in the script.
You're the comic relief.
Yes, and you know what else?
I'm the hero so shut up!
You see, Hollywood is writing our lives and you know something?
I don't want to shoot people anymore and blow up buildings.
You know why we do this here?
You got to be a magician, after all, Nick.
It really does work.
The ticket's yours, Danny, and you know something?
I think the magic was yours, too.
Come on.
Ever tell you about the time
I was about your age and my pop took me to see Buffalo Bill?
Yeah, well, we went backstage to see
Sitting Bull who was his medicine man.
'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems... in a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.
For the story that you are about to be told... took place in the holiday worlds of old.
Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from.
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!
Boys and girls of every age
Wouldn't you like to see something strange
Come with us and you will see
This our town of Halloween
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween
Everybody make a scene
Trick-or-treat till the neighbor's gonna die of fright
It's our town
Everybody scream
In this town of Halloween
I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under your stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town
Don't we love it now
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can
- Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll
- Scream
- This is Halloween
- Red and black
- And slimy green
- Aren't you scared
- Well, that's just fine
Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream
Everybody scream
In our town of Halloween
I am the clown with a tear-away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the who when you call who's there
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Tender lumplings everywhere
Life's no fun without a good scare
- That's our job
- But we're not mean
In our town of Halloween
In this town
Don't we love it now
Everyone's waiting for the next surprise
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin
This is Halloween
Everybody scream
Won't you please make way for a very special guy
Our man Jack is king of the pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween
La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee
- It's over!
- We did it!
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!
Great Halloween, everybody.
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.
No! Thanks to you, Jack.
Without your brilliant leadership--
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.
Walls fall? You made the very mountains crack, Jack.
- The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!
- You're not ready for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!
Come back here, you foolish--
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.
Ooh, Jack, you made wounds ooze and flesh crawl.
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Hold it. We haven't given out the prizes yet.
Our first award goes to the vampires... for most blood drained in a single evening.
Our second and honorable mention... goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.
Nice work, Bone Daddy.
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year... and the year before that, and the year before that.
There are few who deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort
Of my ghost-like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With a wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year
It's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And l, Jack the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing
Oh, somewhere deep
Inside of these bones
An emptiness
Began to grow
There's something out there
Far from my home
A longing that
I've never known
I'm the master of fright
And a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky
And I'm known throughout
England and France
And since I am dead
I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
But who here
Would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown lf they only understood
He'd give it all up
If he only could
Oh, there's an empty
Place in my bones
That calls out for
Something unknown
The fame and praise
Come year after year
Does nothing for
These empty tears
Jack.
I know how you feel.
Sally!
You've come back.
- I had to.
- For this!
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!
I made you with my own hands.
You can make other creations.
I'm restless. I can't help it.
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.
We need to be patient, that's all.
But I don't want to be patient.
No, Zero, not now.
I'm not in the mood.
All right.
Here you go, boy.
Mornin', gents!
Jack, you home?
Jack, I've got the plans for next Halloween.
I need to go over them with you so we can get started.
Jack, please! I'm only an elected official here.
I can't make decisions by myself.
Jack, answer me!
- Huh?
- He's not home.
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.
Where are we?
It's someplace new!
What is this?
Whoa-oa-oa!
Whoa!
What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere
What's this
There's white things in the air
What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this
What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong
What's this, there's people singing songs, what's this
The streets are lined with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this
What's this
There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys and absolutely no one's dead
There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones
I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside
Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe
They kiss, why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this
What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why
They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings and there's a smile on everyone
So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this
Oh my, what now
The children are asleep
But look
There's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them
Only little cozy things secure inside their dreamland
What's this
The monsters are all missing and the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be good feeling all around
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies are absolutely everywhere
The sights, the sounds they're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know, I've got to know what is this place that I have found
What is this
Christmas Town?
Hmm.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hmm.
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.
Stand aside. Coming through.
We've got to find Jack!
There's only 365 days left till next Halloween!
Three sixty-four!
Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check?
I looked in every mausoleum.
We opened the sarcophagi!
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.
I peeked behind the cyclops' eye.
I did! But he wasn't there.
It's time to sound the alarms!
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.
Bitter!
Worm's wart. But where, where is that worm's wart?
Sally? ls that soup ready yet?
Ah. Coming!
Lunch!
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart! Mmm!
And frog's breath?
Wh-What's wrong? l-l thought you liked frog's breath.
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath.
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.
I'm not hungry. Oops.
You want me to starve... an old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is.
Me, to whom you owe your very life.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?
Oh, this morning.
- Hear that?
- Ah, what?
- Shh.
Zero!
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.
- When?
- Immediately!
Town meeting! Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Listen, everyone!
I want to tell you about Christmas Town.
There were objects so peculiar they were not to be believed
All around things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen
And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you.
Ooh!
This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box
- A box
- Is it steel
- Are there locks
- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox
If you please.
Just a box with bright colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow
- A bow
- But why
- How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it
That's the point of the thing
Not to know
- It's a bat
- Will it bend
- It's a rat
- Will it break
Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake
Listen now
You don't understand
That's not the point of Christmasland
Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall
Oh, yes, does it still have a foot
- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook
Um, let me explain.
There's no foot inside but there's candy
- Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
- Small toys
- Do they bite
- Do they snap
- Or explode in the sack
Well, perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once
Everyone, please
Now not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
I don't know.
Do you get it?
Well, I may as well give them what they want.
And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmasland
Is a fearsome king with a deep, mighty voice
Least, that's what
I've come to understand
And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is so I've heard it said
And on a dark cold night under full moonlight
He flies into a fog like a vulture in the sky
And they call him
Sandy Claws
Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmasland
Oh, well.
Hmm.
Hmm.
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Christmas thing.
You've poisoned me for the last time, you wretched girl.
Oh, my head!
The door is open!
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some equipment.
Is that so? Whatever for?
I'm conducting a series of experiments.
How perfectly marvelous!
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.
Hmm. Experiments?
Zero, I'm home!
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?
You can come out now if you promise to behave.
Sally?
Sally?
Oh, gone again!
Hmm.
Oh!
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back
He's all alone up there locked away inside
- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Christmastime is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be
I cannot tell
There's so many things
I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip
Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant
Gone in a flash
What does it mean
What does it mean
In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though
Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see
What does it mean
What does it mean
What does it mean
Hmm. Hmm.
I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them
Something's wrong
It's so hard to put my bony finger on
Or perhaps it's really not as deep as I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard
Of course
I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me
It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
You know I think this Christmas thing is not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone
Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime
I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Eureka!
This year,
Christmas will be ours!
Patience, everyone. Jack has a special job for each of you.
Dr. Beetlestein.
Your Christmas assignment is ready.
Dr. Beetlestein, to the front of the line.
What kind of noise is that for a baby to make?
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!
I knew it!
Doctor, thank you for coming.
We need some of these.
Hmm.
Their construction should be exceedingly simple, I think.
How horrible our Christmas will be.
No! How jolly!
Oh. How jolly our Christmas will be.
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.
- Specifically.
- By name.
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.
Jack, Jack, it's Boogie's boys.
Ah, Halloween's finest trick or treaters.
The job I have for you is top secret.
It requires craft, cunning, mischief.
And we thought you didn't like us, Jack.
Absolutely no one is to know about it. Not a soul!
Now.
Tree.
Christmas Town.
Ow! Hmm.
And one more thing.
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!
Whatever you say, Jack.
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws
- I wanna do it
- Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together
- Three of a kind
- Birds of a feather
- Now and forever
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then turn off all the lights
First we're going to set some bait inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate
Wait, I've got a better plan to catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks
And Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased I do declare
That he will cook him rare
Whee
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more
You're so stupid
Think now if we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too
I'll bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
We're his little henchmen and we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him and stay on his good side
- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one
- You're no fun
- Shut up
- Make me
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now in the box we'll wait and hide until his curiosity
Entices him to look inside and then we'll have him one, two, three
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key
Sandy Claws, huh?
It goes something like this.
How about it?
Think you can manage?
A-one, and a-two, and a-three, and a--
- Next!
- Fantastic!
Now, why don't you all practice on that, and we'll be in great shape.
Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.
My Christmas is filled with laughter and joy.
And this: my Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red.
The trim is white.
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.
Who else is clever enough to make my Sandy Claws outfit?
- Next!
- I have...
- Oh.
- every confidence in you.
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.
This device is called a nutcracker.
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!
That's not Sandy Claws!
- It isn't?
- Who is it?
- Bunny!
- Eek! Ooh.
Not Sandy Claws! Take him back!
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.
Which door?
There's more than one.
Sandy Claws is behind the door shaped like this.
I told you!
- You knock it off!
- Get-- Ow! Ow!
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
Take him home first!
And apologize again.
Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.
We'll get it right next time.
You will be a decided improvement... over that treacherous Sally.
Master. The plans.
Excellent, lgor.
- What?
- What's goin' on?
This time
This time
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Making Christmas is so fine
It's ours this time
And won't the children be surprised
It's ours this time
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas
Time to give them something fun
They'll talk about for years to come
- Let's have a cheer from everyone
- It's time to party
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Snakes and mice get wrapped up so nice
With spider legs and pretty bows
It's ours this time
All together that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime
Here comes Jack.
I don't believe what's happening to me
My hopes, my dreams
My fantasies
Won't they be impressed
I am a genius
See how I transform this old rat
Into a most delightful hat
- Hmm.
- My compliments from me to you on this your most intriguing hat
- Consider though this substitute
A bat in place of this old rat
- Huh!
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher
Something pleasant
Try again
Don't give up
All together that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime
- This time, this time
- It's ours
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
La, la, la
It's almost here and we can't wait
So ring the bells and celebrate
'Cause when the full moon starts to climb, we'll all sing out
It's Christmastime
Kathleen, Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty, nice, nice, nice--
There are hardly any naughty children this year.
Now, who could that be?
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?
Ya!
You don't look like yourself,
Jack, not at all.
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!
But you're the Pumpkin King!
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now!
Jack, I know you think something's missing, but--
- Ow!
- Sorry.
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?
I've got the beard, the coat, the boots, the belt--
- Jack, Jack, this time we bagged him.
- This time we really did!
- He sure is big, Jack!
- And heavy!
Let me out!
Sandy Claws in person!
What a pleasure to meet you!
Wh-- Why, you have hands!
- You don't have claws at all!
- Wha--
Where am l?
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.
You don't need to have another worry about Christmas this year.
- Wha-- Well, wha-- Wha--
- Consider this a vacation,
Sandy, a reward.
- It's your turn to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake!
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas. Of course!
- That's what I'm missing!
- B-B-but--
- Thanks.
- Y-You just can't--
Hold on.
Where are we going now?
Ho, ho, ho! No.
- This is worse than I thought.
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Much worse.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- I know.
Me, on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?
To Oogie Boogie, of course.
There isn't anywhere in the whole world more comfortable than that.
- And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.
Haven't you heard of peace on earth and goodwill toward men?
No!
Ah! This'll stop Jack.
What a joy to think of all we'll have in common.
We'll have conversations worth having!
Don't do this!
Naughty children never get any presents!
- I think he might be too big!
- Ooh!
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney... he can fit down here.
Well, well, well!
What have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about.
You're jokin'
You're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now if I don't die laughin' first
Mr. Oogie Boogie says there's trouble close at hand
You better pay attention now
'cause I'm the boogie man
And if you aren't shakin' there's somethin' very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time you hear the boogie song
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- I'm the Oogie Boogie man
- He's the Oogie Boogie man
Release me now or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses
Ah, you're jokin'
You're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny
I'm laughin'
You really are too much
And now with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna do the best I can.
Whoa
The sound of rolling dice to me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' boogie man although I don't play fair
It's much more fun
I must confess with lives on the line
Not mine, of course
But yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine
Release me fast or you will have to answer for this heinous act
Oh, brother, you're somethin'
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending the position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't goin' nowhere
Whoa! It's Jack!
Think of us as you soar triumphantly through the sky... outshining every star... your silhouette a dark blot on the moon.
You, who are our pride.
You, who are our glory.
- You, who have frightened millions into an early grave.
- Ow!
You, who have, uh... devastated the, the souls of the living?
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.
- The reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses.
- Whew!
This fog's as thick as, as--
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!
There go all of my hopes... my precious plans, my glorious dreams.
There goes Christmas.
No, Zero. Down, boy.
My, what a brilliant nose you have!
The better to light my way!
To the head of the team, Zero!
We're off!
Wait, Jack! No!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!
Good-bye, Jack.
My dearest Jack.
Oh, how I hope my premonition is wrong.
I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice
My feelings for him
And will he see
How much he means to me
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may it doesn't last
And will we ever
End up together
No, I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Santa!
Santa?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
- Uh, uh, uh, uh--
- That's all right.
I have a special present for you anyway. There you go, sonny.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
And what did Santa bring you, honey?
Merry Christmas!
Hello. Police.
Attacked by Christmas toys?
That's strange. That's the second toy complaint we've had.
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Huh?
Oh, wait!
Whoa! Help! Help!
You're welcome, one and all!
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.
Police. I know. I know.
A skeleton. Keep calm.
Turn off all the lights. Make sure the doors are locked. Hello. Police.
Reports are pouring in from all over the globe... that an impostor is shamelessly impersonating Santa Claus... mocking and mangling this joyous holiday.
Authorities assure us that at this moment... military units are mobilizing to stop the perpetrator of this heinous crime.
- Jack! Someone has to help Jack.
- Wherever you are...
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- come back and save Christmas.
Look, Zero, searchlights!
They're celebrating!
They're thanking us for doing such a good job.
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!
It's okay, Zero. Head higher.
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?
Let's play. Hmm?
My, my! What have we here?
I'll get you out of here.
Ah. Lovely.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Uh, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
What? You try to make a dupe out of me!
Oh!
Who's next on my list?
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?
They're trying to hit us. Zero!
Merry Christmas to all... and to all a good night!
I knew this Christmas thing was a bad idea.
I felt it in my gut.
Terrible news, folks.
The worst tragedy of our times.
Jack has been blown to smithereens!
Terrible, terrible news!
Attention. Attention, citizens.
Terrible news. There's still no sign of Santa Claus.
Although the impostor has been shot down... it looks like Christmas will have to be cancelled this year.
I repeat, the impostor has been shot down... but there's still no sign yet of Santa.
What have I done
What have I done
How could I
Be so blind
All is lost
Where was I
Spoiled all
Spoiled all
Everything's
Gone all wrong
What have I done
What have I done
Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years
They'll find me only dust
And a plaque that reads
Here lies poor old Jack
But I never intended all this madness
Never
And nobody really understood
Well, how could they
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should
Well, what the heck
I went and did my best
And by god
I really tasted something swell
And for a moment why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did
And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my old bony self again
And l, Jack
The Pumpkin King
That's right, I am the Pumpkin King
Ha-ha-ha-ha
And I just can't wait until next Halloween
'Cause I've got some new ideas that will really make them scream
And by god I'm really going to give it all my might
Uh-oh. I hope there's still time... to set things right.
Sandy Claws! Hmm.
You wait 'til Jack hears about this!
By the time he's through with you, you'll be lucky if you--
The King of Halloween... has been blown to smithereens.
Skeleton Jack is now a pile of dust.
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.
What's that you said about luck, rag doll?
Help! Help! Help!
Shh.
Looks like it's Oogie's turn to boogie now.
- Help!
- One, two, three... four, five, six, seven.
Help!
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
Oh, I'm feeling weak with hunger!
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.
What? Snake eyes?
Eleven!
Looks like I won the jackpot!
Bye-bye, doll face and sandman.
What the--
- Hello, Oogie.
- J-J-J-Jack!
But they said you were dead.
You must be double dead!
Oh!
Well, come on, bone man!
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!
Fire!
Hmm. Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Jack, look out!
So long, Jack.
How dare you treat my friends so shamefully!
Now look what you've done!
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.
I'm afraid I've made a terrible mess of your holiday.
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?
The next time you get the urge to take over someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.
She's the only one who makes any sense around this insane asylum.
- Skeletons! Boogie men! Ooh.
- I hope there's still time.
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!
I'm Santa Claus.
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.
How did you get down here, Sally?
Oh, l-l was trying to--
Well, I wanted to, to--
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just--
Sally, I can't believe
I never realized that you--
- Jack! Jack!
- Here he is!
- Alive!
- Just like we said!
- Grab ahold, my boy!
Whoa!
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one and only, has finally been spotted.
Old Saint Nick appears to be traveling at supersonic speed.
He's setting things right, bringing joy and cheer wherever he goes.
Yes, folks, Kris Kringle has pulled it out of the bag... and delivered Christmas to excited children all over the world.
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la
- Jack!
- Jack's back!
- Jack?
- Jack's okay!
- He's all right!
- It's Jack!
Jack's okay
And he's back
Oh, yea
He's all right
Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, whee
Jack is back now
Everyone sing
In the town of Halloween
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Happy Halloween!
Merry Christmas!
- What's this
- What's this
- I haven't got a clue
- What's this
- Why, it's completely new
What's this
Must be a Christmas thing
- What's this
- It's really very strange
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
What's this
What's this
Careful, my precious jewel.
My dearest friend if you don't mind
I'd like to join you by your side
Where we can gaze into the stars
And sit together
Now and forever
For it is plain
As anyone can see
We're simply meant to be
{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{1529}{1613}Not bad.
{1651}{1750}But not good enough to live.
{1944}{2042}Mind if I sit down?|I don't have your energy.
{2048}{2140}Fight with your head.
{2169}{2257}Not your heart.
{2532}{2574}Straight.
{2580}{2634}Better, Einon.
{2640}{2745}But you're still dead.
{2870}{2966}Purpose, not passion.
{3185}{3294}No one ever found victory|in the dirt.
{3350}{3394}The peasants are revolting.
{3400}{3452}They've always been revoltin', Prince.
{3458}{3507}But now they're rebellin'.
{3513}{3595}King Freyne wants his son|to witness his noble victory.
{3601}{3682}There's nothing noble|about crushing desperate men.
{3688}{3730}They're traitorous scum!
{3736}{3827}The king commands!|Bring him!
{3894}{4007}You can come, too, nursemaid.
{5512}{5617}Die, you dog!
{5844}{5916}- I wish we were down there.|- No, you don't.
{5922}{5975}Yes, I do. Just to see you|in action, Bowen.
{5981}{6039}Yours would be|the finest blade on the field.
{6045}{6111}My blade was not made|for your father's slaughter.
{6117}{6187}He is my father, Bowen,|and he is the king.
{6193}{6235}Yes.
{6241}{6294}But when you are king,|remember today...
{6300}{6364}and the difference|between battle and butchery.
{6370}{6418}And remember the Old Code.
{6424}{6513}Then you'll be a greater king|than your father.
{6546}{6596}I promise, Knight...
{6602}{6700}I will be greater.
{7548}{7607}Freyne!
{7613}{7733}Now, Hewe, now!
{7996}{8059}- He's trapped!|- Einon!
{8065}{8149}Einon!
{8335}{8441}Einon, no!
{8746}{8788}Enough! Enough!
{8794}{8886}The battle's out there!
{9355}{9445}Father?
{9748}{9851}Die! It's mine!
{10972}{11072}Einon! Einon!
{11073}{11120}I'm here, Einon!
{11126}{11232}I'm here, my King.
{11924}{11966}Dead, madam.
{11972}{12112}King Freyne,|your husband, slain.
{12152}{12237}In here!
{12264}{12376}In here, on the bed.
{12461}{12568}Get out! Out!|Out! Brok, out!
{12570}{12657}You stay, Bowen.
{12739}{12843}Forgive me, Queen Aislinn.
{12843}{12898}There's nothing to forgive.
{12904}{13004}His father's tyranny|brought him to this end.
{13042}{13137}He's beyond all help.
{13327}{13410}Not all.
{13495}{13540}A knight is sworn to valor.
{13546}{13595}Sworn to valor.
{13601}{13656}- His heart knows only virtue.|- Virtue.
{13662}{13755}His blade defends the helpless.
{13761}{13848}His might upholds the weak.
{13864}{13913}You must stay awake, my son!
{13919}{13973}- You must stay awake. Repeat the Code.|- The Code.
{13979}{14022}His might upholds the weak.
{14028}{14101}H-His word speaks only truth.
{14107}{14149}His wrath...
{14155}{14241}Undoes the wicked.
{14486}{14579}Brok, stay there.
{14750}{14868}Lord! Great one!
{14917}{14976}Your song is sad!
{14982}{15041}Are the stars shining tonight?
{15047}{15177}No. No bright souls|glitter in this darkness.
{15313}{15417}Leave us. Go.
{15418}{15473}Aislinn, daughter of the Celts.
{15479}{15559}Whose people loved your kind|and called you friend.
{15565}{15632}Ah, the king's son...
{15638}{15692}cruel and full of trickery.
{15698}{15821}- Is this why you've come,|dragonslayer's wife?|- Dragonslayer's widow!
{15827}{15906}This boy is not his father.
{15912}{16026}This knight here is his mentor.|He has taught him the Old Code.
{16058}{16141}I need your help.
{16402}{16450}The wound is deep.
{16456}{16513}You know what you ask.
{16519}{16577}I will teach him your ways.
{16583}{16653}He will grow in your grace.|He will grow just and good.
{16659}{16701}I swear.
{16707}{16803}No! The boy must swear.|Give me your sword, Knight.
{16809}{16893}Your sword!
{17030}{17107}Do not be afraid.|He can save you.
{17113}{17155}Now listen to me, boy.
{17161}{17246}Swear that your father's|blood lust and tyranny died with him.
{17252}{17323}Swear that you will live|and rule with mercy.
{17329}{17383}Come to me|and learn the Once-ways.
{17389}{17431}Now swear!
{17437}{17531}I swear.
{17779}{17854}He's dead!
{17860}{17935}Peace, Knight of the Old Code.
{17941}{18049}Witness the wonders|of an ancient glory.
{19258}{19314}Half my heart|to make you whole.
{19320}{19392}Its strength|to purify your weakness.
{19398}{19516}Live, and remember your oath.
{20337}{20431}I served the father only|for the sake of the son.
{20437}{20501}All my hopes rest on him.
{20507}{20562}Forgive a doubting fool.
{20568}{20664}Call when you need of me.|Ask what you will of me.
{20670}{20765}My sword, my service are yours.
{20771}{20854}Only remind him|always of his vow...
{20860}{20969}Knight of the Old Code.
{21235}{21294}Brok.
{21300}{21346}Your Majesty?
{21352}{21423}The Romans built|this great fortress.
{21429}{21550}I will rebuild it,|and mine will be greater.
{21562}{21652}It will take many men, my Lord,|to rebuild this ruin.
{21658}{21703}Yes.
{21709}{21801}Yes, it will.
{22512}{22553}Not so rebellious now.
{22559}{22694}You should thank me, boy.|It was my stroke made you king.
{22703}{22787}No, Brok, I want no martyrs.
{22793}{22887}Death should be a release,|not a punishment.
{22921}{22963}Look good, dog.
{22969}{23050}I'm the last thing|you'll ever see.
{23056}{23138}Burn the insolence|out of his eyes.
{23138}{23209}No! No!|Not my eyes! No!
{23215}{23286}Father!
{23292}{23375}Run!
{23526}{23580}How dare you defy me!
{23586}{23667}Einon, you're unwell.|You've been bewitched.
{23673}{23754}Look at this!|It's madness!
{23760}{23854}- Remember the Code!|- The king is above the Code!
{23889}{23943}Have you forgotten|everything I taught you?
{23949}{24036}No one is above the Code...
{24042}{24145}especially the king.
{24614}{24692}Dragon, I loved that boy,|and you changed him!
{24698}{24747}You tricked me, Dragon!
{24753}{24825}No matter where you fly...
{24831}{24929}no matter where you go,|I will find you!
{24935}{24999}Today I make a new vow!
{25005}{25149}I will spend the rest of my life|hunting you down!
{25224}{25289}Avalon, oh, Avalon.
{25295}{25354}For you I quest each day...
{25360}{25414}the resting place of Arthur...
{25420}{25490}and the Old Code of his way.
{25496}{25563}And when I find|those holy stones...
{25569}{25656}I'll pray, I'll pray, I'll pray.
{25662}{25726}Oh, Avalon, bright Avalon...
{25732}{25795}think me not a fool.
{25801}{25914}My quest is not for vanity,|my quest is spiritual.
{25920}{25967}Spiritual!
{25973}{26046}Merlin, spiritual!
{26052}{26105}Whoa! Merlin!
{26111}{26194}Merlin! Ow!
{26271}{26365}Everyone's a critic!
{26852}{26911}- Dragon, dragon.|- Yes, I know. Where?
{26917}{27017}There, there.
{27797}{27908}Get back here, horse.|You coward.
{27968}{28072}Marvelous! Heroics befitting the days|of Arthur and the Round Table!
{28078}{28125}Never have I seen such skill!
{28131}{28199}Then you must have lived|the sheltered life...
{28205}{28252}of a mon... monk.
{28258}{28344}Why, yes. A scribe, scholar,|historian and poet.
{28350}{28415}Your servant, sir,|Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur.
{28421}{28501}My humble life is in debt|to your exalted prowess...
{28507}{28592}your dauntless courage,|and your superb, swift sword.
{28598}{28643}You have the poet's gift|of exaggeration.
{28649}{28697}Sir, you should read|my histories.
{28703}{28792}But you belittle your talent.|Modesty as well as valor.
{28798}{28858}The Code of ancient Camelot|still lives.
{28864}{29007}Hardly worthy of Camelot.|Still, it's one less dragon.
{29050}{29102}Well done, Knight!|Congratulations.
{29108}{29157}Our gratitude,|mine and King Einon's.
{29163}{29236}Uh, you can keep your gratitude.|I'll take the gold.
{29242}{29294}- Yours or the king's.|- Gold, Knight?
{29300}{29380}We made a bargain, remember?|One dragon put down, one bag of gold.
{29386}{29446}Your honor has a price,|Sir Knight?
{29452}{29504}It has expenses.
{29510}{29567}Honor won't feed my belly|nor shoe my horse.
{29573}{29618}The priest is right.
{29624}{29714}It is your duty to protect King Einon's|vassals as a knight of the realm.
{29720}{29814}Not of this realm.|I bend no knee to Einon.
{29820}{29883}I should have known.|Foreign riffraff!
{29889}{29983}Well, begone, vagabond,|before I arrest you!
{29989}{30032}Back to work, you scum!
{30038}{30110}If King Einon's wheat|isn't cut before the rain...
{30116}{30191}I'll do a little cutting|of my own!
{30197}{30287}Sir Knight!|Sir Knight, wait!
{30290}{30325}Sir Knight!
{30331}{30375}Hear me out!
{30381}{30438}I'm on a pilgrimage.|Might we travel together?
{30444}{30560}The road's still free,|unless Einon's taxed it.
{30760}{30845}A road tax, King Einon. Hmm?
{30851}{30934}A road tax.
{30940}{30982}They are your roads, after all.
{30988}{31042}People really ought to pay|for the privilege of using them.
{31048}{31118}- And those that can't pay|will have to work it off.|- Ingenious, Felton.
{31124}{31186}Only you could keep such a good brain|under such a bad hat.
{31192}{31263}That's very good, "bad hat".
{31269}{31319}Out of my way, peacock.
{31325}{31394}Brok, some are good at hunting men,|some are good at hunting money.
{31400}{31502}Both have value for me.
{32993}{33077}Kara?
{33092}{33158}Kara, I told you...
{33164}{33268}- I told you not to come here anymore.|- I'm a disobedient child.
{33274}{33379}Go on. Take a drink. Go on.
{33385}{33432}Magnificent shot, Your Highness!
{33438}{33511}- Care to double the wager?|- Ah, yes, happily.
{33517}{33561}Shall we say the water bucket?
{33567}{33659}Stand still. Stand still.
{33673}{33732}Superb!
{33738}{33780}Double again?
{33786}{33890}Double again. Why not?
{33900}{33950}I say.
{33956}{34000}A moving target.
{34006}{34093}Peasant scum.
{34215}{34277}You've got a nerve,|interfering with the king's sport!
{34283}{34385}There's no sport|in tormenting a sick, old man.
{34388}{34467}I beg Your Majesty,|let him go.
{34473}{34582}It's been 12 years.|Your castle is built.
{34588}{34679}He can do you no more harm.
{34686}{34785}For God's sake, release him.
{34884}{34940}Father!
{34946}{35005}I've always said death is a release,|not a punishment.
{35011}{35109}Go.
{35197}{35281}Kara.
{36323}{36391}Yoo-hoo!|Yoo-hoo!
{36397}{36480}I've decided to compose|"The Ballad of Bowen"!
{36486}{36582}- How do you prefer I should write this?|- Far away!
{36588}{36661}Oh, don't concern yourself|with my safety!
{36667}{36767}I mean verse, meter.
{36773}{36850}Shall I spice it up|with a poetical flourish...
{36856}{36914}or just the cold, hard facts?
{36920}{36962}If you do not be quiet...
{36968}{37036}you and I shall be the only things|that are cold and hard around here.
{37042}{37131}I mean, it's all very well to go|hacking and whacking at dragons.
{37137}{37243}But if a dragon falls in the|forest and nobody gets to hear|about it, does it make a thud?
{37249}{37348}- Brother Gilbert.|- What?
{37550}{37626}The quill is mightier than the s...
{37632}{37674}Ooh.
{37680}{37804}The quill is mightier than the...
{37974}{38044}That's all that's left|of the last dragonslayer...
{38050}{38100}who tangled with me!
{38106}{38201}If I were you,|I'd quit while I was ahead.
{38354}{38474}Is that the best you can do?
{38532}{38574}Catch!
{38580}{38660}You know, I've got quite|a collection of victims in here.
{38666}{38756}I won't be added to it!
{38788}{38858}I've given you|my final warning.
{38864}{38930}Into the mouth of death he strode.
{38936}{39005}Into the gringy gloom.
{39011}{39073}Into the pit of fear unknown...
{39079}{39138}perhaps to court his doom.
{39144}{39201}That was good.
{39207}{39300}What did I say?|What did I say?
{39448}{39508}A little damp for fire,|isn't it?
{39514}{39598}Why must you knight-errants|out to make a name for yourselves...
{39604}{39648}always pick on us dragons?
{39654}{39706}I don't need a name!
{39712}{39762}And I have a collection of my own!
{39768}{39846}Yeah? You're one|who kills dragons for money.
{39852}{39906}It's honest enough work.
{39912}{39954}One must earn a living.
{39960}{40056}Oh, yes, one must live.
{40062}{40152}Well, since you seek a profit,|we might as well begin.
{40158}{40215}Oh, don't flatter yourself.
{40221}{40300}It's not the profit.|It's the pleasure.
{40306}{40444}Perhaps less pleasurable|and more costly than you think!
{40527}{40590}Bowen! Bowen, take care!
{40596}{40656}He went that way!
{40662}{40750}Take care, Bowen!
{41929}{41988}You can't fly forever!
{41994}{42074}- Neither can you!|- Slow down!
{42080}{42203}Come, visit the woods!
{42216}{42309}Whoa!
{42431}{42518}Look out! Well done!
{42524}{42592}- Ow!|- Pity. That must have hurt.
{42598}{42644}- Yeah!|- Again?
{42650}{42691}- Ow!|- And again?
{42697}{42788}How do you like the ride so far?
{42794}{42901}We're earning our money now,|aren't we?
{42907}{43020}Now, is there somewhere you|would like me to drop you off?
{43154}{43250}Yikes!
{43369}{43465}The sword against the fang and claw.|The flame against the shield.
{43471}{43514}Blah, blah, blah,|which one would win?
{43520}{43604}Blah, blah,|field, shield, wield.
{43610}{43669}Whose flesh from bones|be peeled. Oh, no.
{43675}{43766}Whose fate would soon be sealed.
{43772}{43816}Whose fate would soon be sealed?
{43822}{43932}Whose fate would soon be sealed!
{43944}{44046}Oh, you're good. Haven't had|this sort of challenge in some time.
{44052}{44139}Nor likely to again!
{44736}{44819}Drat!
{44914}{44968}A little overconfident, aren't we?
{44974}{45055}Hardly. But if you win,|you'll be out of work.
{45061}{45152}I will not stop until I've rid the world|of every last one of you.
{45158}{45249}I am the last one!
{45755}{45889}You're just trying to save|your scaly hide with tricks.
{45909}{45994}Haven't you noticed the pickings|are rather slim these days?
{46000}{46052}I got me one just the other day.
{46058}{46159}So it was you who killed the|Scarred One. She and I were the last.
{46165}{46230}Must've been a proud kill, warrior.
{46236}{46312}How much gold did her tattered carcass|put in your purse?
{46318}{46365}That's none of your business.
{46371}{46461}Couldn't have been very much.|And you'll kill me for sport?
{46467}{46528}And when there are|no more dragons to slay...
{46534}{46581}how will you make|a living, Knight?
{46587}{46666}Shut up!
{46995}{47089}Whoa!
{47112}{47265}If your teeth come down, my sword|goes up, right into your brain!
{47352}{47438}If your sword goes up,|my teeth come down!
{47444}{47528}Into the moonlit night|the titans dueled...
{47534}{47600}in mortal combat bound.
{47606}{47709}Oh, who'd the fatal|false step make?
{47715}{47833}Whose blood|would stain the ground?
{48264}{48345}Oh, good Lord.|Sir Eglamore.
{48351}{48419}Oh, thank you very much.
{48425}{48475}It's been stuck down there|for months.
{48481}{48531}Can you get your buttocks|off my tongue?
{48537}{48584}Why should you|be comfortable?
{48590}{48690}My armor is rusting in your drool,|and your breath is absolutely foul.
{48696}{48742}Well, what do you expect...
{48748}{48814}with old knights|rotting between my molars?
{48820}{48908}Oh, God, my mouth is so dry.
{48948}{48998}No, no, no, stop!
{49004}{49089}No, stop!
{49131}{49203}Sorry about that.
{49209}{49276}It seems we're in a bit|of a stalemate, wouldn't you say?
{49282}{49352}Yuck! But I can go|three days without sleep.
{49358}{49405}I can go three weeks.
{49411}{49489}Ooh! I'll stab you|before I nod off.
{49495}{49596}And I'll chomp you.|Marvelous, we'll kill each other.
{49602}{49658}- What do you suggest?|- A truce.
{49664}{49734}Get out of my mouth|and let's talk face-to-face.
{49740}{49803}How do I know I can trust you?
{49809}{49874}I give you my word.
{49880}{49949}The word of a dragon.|It's worthless.
{49955}{50077}Stubborn lout!
{50127}{50184}I should have known!
{50190}{50294}Go on. Kill me!
{50372}{50436}I don't want to kill you!|I never did!
{50442}{50496}And I don't want you to kill me!
{50502}{50544}How do we gain?
{50550}{50618}If you win, you lose a trade.
{50624}{50688}If I win, I wait around|for the next sword slinger...
{50694}{50776}thirsting to carve a reputation|out of my hide.
{50782}{50832}And I'm tired of lurking in holes...
{50838}{50901}and skulking in darkness.
{50907}{50949}I'm gonna let you up now.
{50955}{51007}And if you insist...
{51013}{51091}we can pursue this fracas|to its final stupidity.
{51097}{51234}Or you can listen|to my alternative.
{51410}{51447}Hmm?
{51453}{51565}What's the alternative?
{51652}{51761}Father, Father, look!
{51792}{51876}Dragon!
{51939}{52003}Out of the way!|Out of the way!
{52009}{52096}Out of the way!
{52695}{52796}Pesky critters, dragons.
{52801}{52843}You!
{52849}{52928}Like big rats.|You never seem to get rid of them.
{52934}{53061}Unless you pay me|two bags of gold, in advance.
{53232}{53320}Come on, Dragon.
{53328}{53414}Come on, Dragon.
{53420}{53504}Yes!
{53506}{53589}Ow!
{54707}{54814}Hmm.
{54820}{54886}Hello.
{54892}{54973}Twenty-eight, twenty-nine.
{54979}{55055}Most profitable, Dragon.|I should have met you a long time ago.
{55061}{55115}There is much gold in the world.
{55121}{55205}Perhaps when you've had your fill of it,|you'll no longer need me.
{55211}{55291}I am a Knight of the Old Code.|My word is my bond.
{55297}{55378}- No compunctions then?|- About what?
{55384}{55477}Well, such deception hardly befits|a Knight of the Old Code.
{55483}{55588}Fleecing Einon's lackeys.|That's a service to mankind.
{55594}{55628}Is it?
{55634}{55703}When you squeeze the nobility,|it's the peasants who feel the pinch.
{55709}{55758}That's not my concern.
{55764}{55846}Why should I stick my neck out|for people afraid to risk their own?
{55852}{55909}Don't clutter up|a clever scheme with morality.
{55915}{55989}Mmm, so be it...
{55995}{56062}Knight of the Old Code.
{56068}{56157}If I wanted my conscience pricked,|I would have stayed with the priest!
{56163}{56234}Huh! And what does a dragon|know of the Old Code, anyway?
{56240}{56287}His blade defends the helpless.
{56293}{56394}His might upholds the weak.|His word speaks only truth.
{56400}{56462}Shut up! I remember.
{56468}{56541}That's all it is, a memory.|Nothing can bring it back.
{56547}{56612}You sound like one who tried.
{56618}{56660}And failed.
{56666}{56747}So I no longer try to change the world,|Dragon. I just try to get by in it.
{56753}{56821}Yes, it's better than death,|I suppose.
{56827}{56888}Oh, is it? I should think|you'd welcome death.
{56894}{57028}You know, the last of your kind,|all your friends dead,|hunted wherever you go.
{57041}{57110}Do you delight in reminding me?
{57116}{57223}Yes, Knight,|I do long for death.
{57229}{57316}But fear it.
{57412}{57519}Why? Aside from your misery,|what's to lose?
{57525}{57609}My soul.
{58317}{58405}Finish him, Brok!
{58427}{58522}Well, are you a man?
{58741}{58802}Should he continue, Mother?
{58808}{59005}Oh, the field belongs to the apparently|inexhaustible Sir Brok, my son.
{59524}{59631}The quarry!
{59642}{59708}First you beg mercy|for your father's fate.
{59714}{59785}Then you try to avenge it.
{59791}{59847}Now, you'll share it.
{59853}{59967}In your kingdom, Einon,|there are worse fates than death.
{59998}{60073}I'll think one up for you.
{60079}{60218}- Take her away.|- No! No!
{60277}{60322}He killed my father!
{60328}{60425}He killed my father!
{60440}{60550}He killed my father!
{61890}{61986}I remember you now.
{61997}{62083}I remember you.
{62104}{62243}Your hair, like fire.
{62306}{62404}You gave me this scar.
{62428}{62511}Didn't you?
{62644}{62781}I... owe... you.
{63104}{63158}I can, uh...
{63164}{63255}I really can.
{63392}{63520}Sorry, Bowen.|I hope you like it well done.
{63623}{63697}You must have hated us very much.
{63703}{63759}I hated one of you.
{63765}{63864}These I killed because I wanted|to kill him. But I never found him.
{63870}{63943}I never will.|If you're the last, he must be dead.
{63949}{63991}Oh, yes.
{63997}{64047}Tell me, what was he like...
{64053}{64150}this, uh, dragon|that you hated?
{64158}{64222}He only had half a heart.
{64228}{64283}But even that was enough|to pollute an innocent boy.
{64289}{64390}Einon was no innocent!|He polluted the heart!
{64396}{64438}How do you know that?
{64444}{64534}How do you know that, Dragon?
{64548}{64608}All dragons know that story.
{64614}{64670}What was to be their hope|became their doom.
{64676}{64775}A spoiled, ungrateful child was given|a great gift and destroyed it!
{64781}{64904}No! I knew Einon.|I was his teacher.
{64910}{65029}I taught him|the ways of honor, of right.
{65035}{65078}Then he betrayed you...
{65084}{65169}just as he betrayed|the dragon whose heart he broke.
{65175}{65217}That's a lie, Dragon!
{65223}{65361}Stop calling me "Dragon"!|I have a name.
{65361}{65418}Well, what is it?
{65424}{65491}You couldn't possibly pronounce it|in your tongue.
{65497}{65611}- Try me.|- It's...
{65992}{66084}Next time stab more flesh,|less cloth.
{66090}{66187}I'll pierce your heart!
{66325}{66413}You already did.
{66482}{66589}A very special heart,|like no other.
{66595}{66709}A black, withered thing|without pity.
{66782}{66858}Then teach me.
{66864}{66959}Pity me.
{66965}{67040}I'll give you everything.
{67046}{67106}Even power.
{67112}{67218}You're so beautiful.
{67373}{67451}Even power.
{67457}{67554}Even a throne.
{68021}{68063}Oh, dear.
{68069}{68134}Thank you.|It's passed now.
{68140}{68190}What was it?
{68196}{68311}An old complaint|that acts up now and again.
{68325}{68428}Forgive me if anything|I said, if I upset you.
{68434}{68544}It wasn't you, not you.
{69348}{69389}Don't be afraid.
{69395}{69477}I won't let you suffer|the same fate as me.
{69483}{69569}I've come to help you.
{69685}{69801}This will bring you out|well below the castle walls.
{70126}{70217}Thank...
{70286}{70369}You.
{70504}{70561}Have you been watching over me|all night?
{70567}{70643}I've been thinking.
{70649}{70716}Yes? About what?
{70722}{70824}Many things.|Mostly about what to call you.
{70830}{70876}I think I've found you a name.
{70882}{70960}You say that as though you reached up|and plucked it from the sky.
{70966}{71022}I did.
{71028}{71080}Up there.
{71086}{71160}Do you see that group of stars?
{71166}{71240}I know those stars very well.
{71246}{71326}- Do you see the shape that they make?|- Mm-hmm, a dragon.
{71332}{71374}Yes.
{71380}{71427}They call it "Draco".
{71433}{71516}It means "dragon"|in the scholars' speech.
{71522}{71580}So instead of calling me|"Dragon" in your tongue...
{71586}{71641}you'll call me "Dragon"|in some other tongue.
{71647}{71710}You're right.|It's silly.
{71716}{71822}No. No, I would be honored|to be named after those stars.
{71828}{71923}I... I truly would.
{71929}{71996}Thank you, Bowen.
{72002}{72085}Draco.
{72193}{72273}Throw off the yoke|of Einon's oppression!
{72279}{72351}We must start to fight back!
{72357}{72429}Your father sang that sour tune once,|and we did fight back.
{72435}{72487}And once was enough!|We'll not dance to it again!
{72493}{72549}No, Hewe, just cringe|like a dog under Einon's boot.
{72555}{72606}At least a cringing dog's|a live one!
{72612}{72711}Hey! Why waste good food|on bad rhetoric?
{72717}{72761}I speak the truth.
{72767}{72856}Truth?|It's rarely inspiring, lass.
{72862}{72909}And it never wins rebellions...
{72915}{73007}but it will stretch necks,|if there is a neck...
{73013}{73116}underneath that little mud pie.
{73255}{73353}Ready or not, here I come!
{73359}{73439}Dragon!
{73562}{73621}It's Draco!
{73627}{73710}About time.
{73834}{73876}Mmm!
{73882}{74000}It seems you people|are in need of a dragonslayer.
{74001}{74104}Where is the lord responsible|for this village?
{74105}{74159}Brok lives in a big house|about six miles away.
{74165}{74242}But he'll only blame any damage on us|and pluck our pockets to pay for it.
{74248}{74337}I won't pluck them as deeply.|I'll make you a fair offer.
{74343}{74438}Take it, or leave him!
{74654}{74731}It's enough you people|grovel to Einon.
{74737}{74805}Will you be bullied by some broken-down,|blackmailing knight as well?
{74811}{74893}That's right, you don't need me.
{74899}{74941}Settle it yourself.
{74947}{75001}Of course, there are other ways.
{75007}{75057}Perhaps you'll part with...
{75063}{75172}one of your precious daughters,|instead of gold.
{75267}{75380}Dragons are partial|to maiden sacrifices, I hear.
{75386}{75517}Don't do this!|Don't do this to me!
{75523}{75568}I was born in this village!
{75574}{75617}You knew my father!|You knew my mother!
{75623}{75693}- Who's the girl?|- A nuisance. Get rid of her.
{75699}{75764}- Why?|- They're trying to placate you|with a sacrifice.
{75770}{75829}Now, whoever gave them|that bright idea?
{75835}{75895}- Never mind. Just get rid of her!|- How?
{75901}{75943}- Eat her!|- Oh, please! Yuck!
{75949}{76004}Aren't we squeamish?|You ate Sir Eglamore, hypocrite.
{76010}{76081}I merely chewed in self-defense,|but I never swallowed.
{76087}{76129}Improvise.
{76135}{76211}All right, all right.
{76217}{76312}He's coming! Quick!
{76977}{77021}You have a beautiful voice.
{77027}{77132}Oh, thank you. We dragons|love to sing when we're happy.
{77138}{77204}Well, you're not like|a dragon at all.
{77210}{77276}Well, how many dragons|do you know?
{77282}{77333}Well, you're the first.
{77339}{77405}You should never listen|to minstrels' fancies.
{77411}{77498}A dragon would never hurt a soul,|unless they tried to hurt him first.
{77504}{77570}Really? Then why were you|in my village?
{77576}{77627}Oh! The village!
{77633}{77697}Yes, the village!|You remember the village?
{77703}{77797}Leave him alone, you bully!|Run, Draco, fly! I'll hold him!
{77803}{77872}- Pick on someone your own size!|- Where have you been?
{77878}{77921}I'm truly sorry, Bowen.
{77927}{78040}I've been distracted.
{78043}{78157}Bowen, meet Kara.
{78157}{78244}- You should have eaten her.|- Oh, don't get angry, Bowen.
{78250}{78293}Why not?
{78299}{78357}You left me high and dry.|I was worried to death!
{78363}{78423}Worried? About me?
{78429}{78478}Yes, about you!
{78484}{78581}I had the whacker all set up.|Half the village is out there with me.
{78587}{78657}We're searching the skies for you,|I don't know where you are.
{78663}{78772}If you're coming back,|when you're coming back. You just...
{78778}{78845}Disappear.
{78851}{78935}Be careful!|He's coming!
{79299}{79365}Well, well, well,|it can't be!
{79371}{79413}But it is!
{79419}{79488}My old mentor.|Still giving carving lessons?
{79494}{79539}Get off your horse.|I'll give you one.
{79545}{79625}Time's not been|kind to you, Bowen.
{79631}{79717}- You should never have broke with me.|- It was you who broke with me!
{79723}{79836}And yet you return to me|with this girl I lost.
{79862}{79929}I think she wants to stay lost.
{79935}{80035}Not her decision, I'm afraid!
{80283}{80372}I'm ready for my lesson now, Knight.
{81042}{81107}That's one lesson you never learned!
{81113}{81208}Only expose your back|to a corpse!
{81225}{81285}You are a corpse!
{81291}{81376}You just don't know it!
{81475}{81527}Lie down, Bowen!
{81533}{81608}You're the sorry scrap|of dead worlds and dead beliefs.
{81614}{81691}No! They were your beliefs!
{81697}{81782}Never. Never mine.
{81849}{81929}You said the words!|You spoke them from your heart!
{81935}{81987}I vomited them up|because I couldn't stomach them!
{81993}{82061}Because I knew it was|what you wanted to hear!
{82067}{82148}Lies! Liar!|I taught you!
{82154}{82217}You taught me to fight,|that's all!
{82223}{82305}I took what I needed from you.
{82311}{82420}You taught me to fight!
{82695}{82782}You taught me well.
{83727}{83807}Who asked you to interfere?
{83813}{83926}I had everything under control!
{84239}{84341}Here, let me see.
{84379}{84438}It's knitted well.
{84444}{84550}You have a healer's touch, Kara.
{84565}{84624}In a few days,|it'll be just another scar.
{84630}{84705}And what's one more scar?
{84711}{84789}To a knight, I mean.|I once knew a knight.
{84795}{84843}He stood all alone|against an evil king...
{84849}{84903}and even saved a rebel leader|from blinding.
{84909}{84956}He must have had many scars.
{84962}{85034}- That knight died|of his wounds long ago.|- That's too bad.
{85040}{85094}His kind is badly missed|in this world.
{85100}{85205}- That's the way|the wretched world is, girl.|- Doesn't have to be.
{85211}{85284}Men like you could...|could lead others.
{85290}{85340}You could give people|courage and hope.
{85346}{85435}Hope? Even if you|could raise your army...
{85441}{85499}do you think they'd stand a chance|against seasoned troops?
{85505}{85552}Last time they tried|it was a massacre.
{85558}{85683}- I remember. I was there.|- So was I.
{85683}{85768}That rebel was my father.
{85778}{85908}Let others stand with you. You'll see|this time the end will be different.
{85974}{86024}What are you looking at?
{86030}{86172}Myself, once upon a time.
{86217}{86266}I'll see you in the village, Draco.
{86272}{86342}That's easy for you to say.
{86348}{86472}This time I'll collect the money,|and you can die.
{86967}{87033}We can lose no more pigs|to this dragon.
{87039}{87089}Wait!
{87095}{87208}This man is a fraud!
{87214}{87266}It's her!
{87272}{87342}This girl is a...|wandering idiot.
{87348}{87392}She babbles nonsense.
{87398}{87482}I'm telling you,|this knight is no dragonslayer.
{87488}{87534}You're mistaken, my child!
{87540}{87614}He's the greatest dragonslayer|there is!
{87620}{87670}Possibly the greatest|there ever will be!
{87676}{87729}- Brother Gilbert!|- Bowen!
{87735}{87779}You're alive.
{87785}{87862}Praised be the saints.|The saints be blessed.
{87868}{87914}You're alive!
{87920}{88014}- And whole.|- Brother Gilbert.
{88020}{88082}You could not put your trust|in a better man.
{88088}{88156}I personally have seen him slay|almost two dragons.
{88162}{88206}- Oh, Brother Gilbert.|- Almost.
{88212}{88288}Well, I didn't actually see|the death blow of the second...
{88294}{88404}but as Bowen is here,|he must have won.
{88412}{88529}Don't you see?|He's in league with the dragon.
{88916}{89004}Hold that there.
{89034}{89124}And here he comes.
{89600}{89653}Sink! Sink!
{89659}{89718}I can't!|It doesn't get any deeper!
{89724}{89787}Well done, Bowen!|You've done it again!
{89793}{89888}What a brute!|That's even bigger than the last one!
{89894}{89985}Actually,|he's about the same size.
{90172}{90222}- Meat.|- Meat.
{90228}{90331}Meat! Meat!
{90477}{90557}Oh, dear.
{90563}{90681}Run! He's getting away!
{91310}{91353}What's going on?
{91359}{91396}Meat!
{91402}{91477}- Meat! Meat!|- Meat!
{91483}{91542}Run. That's what's going on!
{91548}{91653}- Run.|- Run?
{91744}{91827}Kara! Kara!
{92021}{92116}Peace, brothers, peace!|Heathens!
{92122}{92205}Brother Gilbert!
{92228}{92296}Oh, good Lord.|Forgive me, my child.
{92302}{92385}Liar! Liar!
{92490}{92560}No dragon, no charge.
{92566}{92614}Meat. Meat.
{92620}{92662}Meat. Meat.
{92668}{92765}Meat. Meat. Meat.
{92891}{92934}We're going to die!
{92940}{93000}God help us!|We're all going to die!
{93006}{93064}Calm yourself, Brother Gilbert,|we're not going to die.
{93070}{93112}We're just flying.
{93118}{93174}If you're going|to get yourself killed...
{93180}{93230}you might as well do it|in the fight against Einon.
{93236}{93291}I think Kara has a point. Oh!
{93297}{93404}But I'd rather discuss it|on the ground.
{93504}{93595}Draco, what unholy place is this?
{93601}{93645}Unholy?
{93651}{93786}This is Avalon, the resting place|of King Arthur himself.
{93787}{93846}So it was foretold...
{93852}{93929}and so have I found you,|brave King Arthur.
{93935}{93992}Valor,
{93998}{94082}virtue, truth.
{94088}{94164}Ah, yes, truth.
{94170}{94274}Amen. Ready now, Kara.
{94280}{94363}And you, Bowen?
{94386}{94486}This is Avalon,|the shadow realm of the Round Table.
{94492}{94570}- It's a divine omen.|- Omens won't win battles.
{94576}{94618}Nor will you.
{94624}{94709}And you'll find out|when you try to raise your army.
{94715}{94772}You already know|the courage in your village.
{94778}{94844}They're very brave at pelting|young girls with vegetables.
{94850}{94897}It must start somewhere.
{94903}{94989}Will you wish us luck, Draco?
{94991}{95086}Long ago, when man was young|and the dragon already old...
{95092}{95148}the wisest of our race|took pity on man.
{95154}{95206}He gathered together|all the dragons...
{95212}{95284}making them vow|to watch over man always.
{95290}{95341}And at the moment of his death...
{95347}{95428}the night became alive|with those stars.
{95434}{95500}And thus was born|the dragons' heaven.
{95506}{95618}But when we die, not all dragons|are admitted to this shining place.
{95624}{95668}No, we have to earn it.
{95674}{95722}And if we don't...
{95728}{95804}our spirit disappears|as if we never were.
{95810}{95914}And that's why I shared my life force|with a dying boy...
{95920}{95970}so I would reunite|man and dragon...
{95976}{96075}and ensure my place|among my ancient brothers of the sky.
{96081}{96178}But my sacrifice|became my sin.
{96184}{96327}It was you. Your heart|beats in Einon's breast.
{96406}{96469}Yes, my half-heart...
{96475}{96545}that cost me all of my soul.
{96551}{96649}Even then I knew|his bloodthirsty nature...
{96655}{96730}but I thought|my heart could change him.
{96736}{96801}My God, I was so naive.
{96807}{96849}No more than I.
{96855}{96941}All my life I've dreamed|of serving noble kings...
{96947}{97016}noble ideals.
{97022}{97064}Dreams die hard...
{97070}{97170}and you hold them in your hands|long after they've turned to dust.
{97176}{97275}I will not be that naive again!
{97329}{97421}Kara, I will go with you.
{97532}{97580}So be it.
{97586}{97680}Farewell, Bowen.
{97879}{97922}Valor!
{97928}{97974}Valor!
{97980}{98119}Valor!|A knight is sworn to valor.
{99186}{99232}A knight is sworn to valor.
{99238}{99289}A knight is sworn to valor!
{99295}{99358}His heart knows only virtue.
{99364}{99413}His heart knows only virtue!
{99419}{99470}His blade defends the helpless.
{99476}{99523}His blade defends the helpless!
{99529}{99579}His might upholds the weak.
{99585}{99634}His might upholds the weak!
{99640}{99694}His word speaks only truth.
{99700}{99747}His word speaks only truth!
{99753}{99800}His wrath undoes the wicked!
{99806}{99910}His wrath undoes the wicked!
{100892}{100946}Now I know you're completely mad.
{100952}{101002}- You want us to follow you|and a priest against Einon?|- Yes.
{101008}{101069}- To hell, more like.|- But this time we can win.|You don't understand.
{101075}{101131}I don't want to understand!|I understand this!
{101137}{101218}I understand six years in a quarry!|That's all I need to understand!
{101224}{101280}Believe me, I know|what you've been through, Hewe.
{101286}{101344}- But this time we've been joined...|- Only a fool would join you!
{101350}{101398}You're not listening|to what I'm saying!
{101404}{101489}I've had enough|of your mischief!
{101715}{101773}Save your strength|for the fight against Einon.
{101779}{101901}- There isn't any fight against Einon.|- I'm going to start one.
{101907}{102002}You and what army, Knight?
{102570}{102624}You have never fired|a bow in your life...
{102630}{102691}- in anger or in practice?|- No.
{102697}{102752}Draw your bow.
{102758}{102893}Sight along the arrow.|Release.
{102952}{103051}Beginner's luck.|Try again.
{103148}{103231}Steady.
{103268}{103392}Brother Gilbert, you're a natural.
{103432}{103516}Easy!
{103534}{103633}Here, widen your stance.
{103662}{103749}Up, down. Up, down.
{103755}{103859}One fluid stroke.
{103996}{104088}This could cleave|a man's skull.
{104185}{104270}Like a pudding.
{104511}{104623}Eat.
{105082}{105180}Whoa! Whoa!
{105196}{105264}- I need more men!|- It's just a few peasants|waving pitchforks!
{105270}{105321}I noticed they're all on your land.
{105327}{105408}You're not too busy hawking|in your old age to keep control|of your minions, are you?
{105414}{105479}You acuse me?
{105485}{105620}I was just saying that any one of us|is worth a hundred of them.
{105632}{105737}My brave Felton,|an army unto himself.
{105743}{105798}Well.
{105804}{105864}Fool!
{105870}{105984}I know this man who leads them,|and I will not underestimate him!
{105990}{106042}Him or the dragon!
{106048}{106139}Don't be afraid|of the dragon, my son.
{106166}{106221}I'm afraid of nothing!
{106227}{106269}Nothing!
{106275}{106366}You understand?
{106528}{106572}A mother's gift to her son.
{106578}{106683}The finest to be had.
{106689}{106762}The finest what?
{106768}{106851}Dragonslayers.
{107176}{107234}Have you thought beyond tomorrow?
{107240}{107290}It's hard to see that far.
{107296}{107353}Look at the camp. What do you see?
{107359}{107448}- What do you hear?|- Hope.
{107454}{107496}Exactly.
{107502}{107583}Down there you have life,|songs and courage.
{107589}{107662}You have everything|you'll ever need.
{107668}{107780}And now, so do I.
{108805}{108914}He dares defy me at my own gates.|Look at him!
{108928}{109017}Well, today his Code|dies once and for all!
{109023}{109110}No! We're safe here,|Your Majesty!
{109116}{109174}That rabble couldn't possibly|storm the castle!
{109180}{109242}By tonight they'll be|cold and wet and tired.
{109248}{109333}They'll probably|just limp off home.
{109376}{109430}We're safe here, Einon!
{109436}{109529}Remember your father!
{110412}{110499}Gotcha!
{110840}{110949}Bear to the right!
{111295}{111398}Let's shear them|like the sheep they are!
{111412}{111534}To the forest!
{112343}{112414}Form up!
{112420}{112532}Form up!
{112578}{112663}Halt! Halt!
{112863}{112948}Second line!
{112955}{113040}Right flank, advance!
{113050}{113165}Get in there,|second line!
{113248}{113357}Charge!
{113988}{114069}Scatter or die!
{114075}{114185}Scatter or die! Go!
{115262}{115345}Like a pudding.
{115608}{115660}Pride goeth before the fall.
{115666}{115757}Help! Help!
{115770}{115863}Help! Help!
{115876}{115960}Turn the other cheek, brother.
{116699}{116758}Retreat! Retreat!
{116764}{116824}Retreat!
{116830}{116890}Return to the castle!|Retreat!
{116896}{117011}Brother Gilbert, it's Einon!|Stop him!
{117060}{117139}Thou...
{117163}{117216}shalt...
{117222}{117274}not...
{117280}{117369}kill!
{118141}{118226}The dragonslayers.
{118679}{118774}Open up! It's the king!
{118873}{118919}Stop!
{118925}{119031}No! I want it alive!
{119092}{119204}Alive and safe.
{119246}{119314}Safe for all eternity.
{119320}{119370}Oh, no.
{119376}{119458}I go to save the dragon!
{119464}{119553}Who will go with me?
{120301}{120428}Come from the shadows, Aislinn.|Come where I can see you.
{120695}{120770}- You know why I've come.|- I know.
{120776}{120889}In giving my heart, I've taken on every|poison stirring in his evil breast.
{120895}{120951}Even the pain of his death|must be mine.
{120957}{121061}You cannot blame yourself.
{121070}{121120}Death without immortality?
{121126}{121182}That was not the only reason.
{121188}{121238}I had to wait for a time|when mankind...
{121244}{121326}would not repeat my mistake|and let tyranny thrive.
{121332}{121393}When there would be those|who remembered the Once-ways...
{121399}{121519}remembered that even in the darkness|there is still light.
{121520}{121653}I cannot see.|Are the stars shining tonight?
{121700}{121762}Brightly, my lord.
{121768}{121810}Brightly.
{121816}{121909}Then let us end it.
{122043}{122126}Forgive me!
{122160}{122262}I know why you brought me|the dragonslayers.
{122268}{122329}You wanted them to kill him|because you wanted me dead.
{122335}{122395}I wanted to correct|a mistake made years ago...
{122401}{122513}when I saved a creature|not worth saving.
{122652}{122741}How un-motherly of you.
{123490}{123534}We have to open the gates.
{123540}{123598}The rest of us|are waiting outside.
{123604}{123661}Go save your dragon, Bowen.
{123667}{123725}Hurry, all of you.
{123731}{123814}It's this way.
{123916}{123969}Well, well, well,|what a pleasant surprise.
{123975}{124072}I expected you, Bowen,|but with my bride-to-be as well?
{124078}{124191}- And with a priest to wed us.|- To bury you.
{124214}{124305}Well, to bury one of us.
{124372}{124469}Kara, the door, quickly!
{125103}{125166}Hurry up. That way.|That way.
{125172}{125238}Quickly, this way.|This way.
{125244}{125328}Come on. Hurry up.
{126320}{126406}Now, I don't know how|you all got in here...
{126412}{126563}but I tell you this:|You are going to get me out.
{126768}{126877}Hewe, thank you.
{127660}{127765}Let me cut it|down to size for you.
{128024}{128113}A girl.
{128120}{128207}A girl!
{128892}{128987}Bowen!
{129196}{129301}Lo, I'm immortal.
{129794}{129898}- Yeah!|- Huh?
{130637}{130706}Now it's you, Bowen.|It's you that has to do it!
{130712}{130756}What are you talking about?
{130762}{130850}As the heart binds Einon to me in life,|it binds us in death.
{130856}{130938}- That's not true!|- You've seen that it is!
{130944}{131010}Through the heart,|we share each other's pains and power.
{131016}{131065}But in my half|beats the life source.
{131071}{131121}For Einon to die,|I must die!
{131127}{131170}Einon is dead.
{131176}{131244}- He lives!|- It doesn't matter.
{131250}{131312}Don't you hear it?|Our rebels have stormed the castle.
{131318}{131374}Alive or dead, Einon's beaten.|We've won!
{131380}{131454}You will never win|until Einon's evil is destroyed...
{131460}{131550}and to do that,|you must destroy me!
{131564}{131626}Once you swore your sword|and service were mine...
{131632}{131709}to call when I had need of you,|to ask what I would of you.
{131715}{131805}I hold you to your vow, Knight!
{131811}{131860}He's coming,|coming to stop you!
{131866}{131977}Strike before it's too late!
{132166}{132210}You are the last.
{132216}{132325}My time is over. Strike!
{132328}{132370}You are my friend.
{132376}{132486}Then, as my friend,|strike, please!
{132492}{132605}- I can't.|- Then I will make you.
{132627}{132748}Fight back, dragonslayer!|Defend yourself!
{133020}{133101}Pick it up!
{133107}{133212}Move, and she dies!
{135530}{135618}What now, Draco?
{135636}{135713}Without you...
{135719}{135773}what do we do?
{135779}{135875}Where do we turn?
{136208}{136273}To the stars, Bowen.
{136279}{136374}To the stars.
{138792}{138870}And in the days following|Draco's sacrifice...
{138876}{138972}Bowen and Kara led the people|in a time of justice and brotherhood.
{138978}{139058}As I remember it now,|those were golden years...
{139064}{139130}warmed by an unworldly light.
{139136}{139195}And when things|became the most difficult...
{139201}{139277}Draco's star shone|more brightly...
{139283}{139388}for all of us|who knew where to look.

Alan, every ten-year-old is afraid of something.
The kid's afraid of tuna-fish sandwiches.
Mercury levels in the tuna.
Whatever.
Alan, the world is a frightening place to him right now.
I think we could be a little more supportive.
Supportive? I'm the most supportive father on earth, but I'm running out of supportive things to do.
I signed him up for Little
League, he drove everybody crazy with statistics about how you can develop tumors from being hit in the head with a ball.
Did you know that shin splints can lead to blood clots in the legs?
Claire, he brought in a medical journal.
Nobody wanted to play after that.
And now I'm building him a tree house, in a tree he refuses to climb.
You know he hates heights.
I don't know. I just want to be a good father.
But you are a good father.
I'm OK! I'm OK!
Aah! No, I'm not!
Hey. Rich!
Well?
You like it?
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.
Hey, how about bringing me up that bag of nails?
No, come on up!
Look. Solid as a rock.
Dad, eight percent of all household accidents involve ladders.
Another three percent involve trees.
We're looking at 11 percent probability here.
Fine. Just put the bag in the bucket, OK?
- Rich.
- Huh?
Ow!
Oh! Oh!
Dad! Do you have feeling in your toes?
Yes, I have feeling in my toes.
Oh, Alan, honey, are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine. Oh!
Can't argue with statistics, Dad.
Statistics. Here's something you can do, go down to Gutman's Hardware
Store, buy a pound of these.
But, Dad...
Son, you can't live your life based on statistics.
You've gotta take some chances.
Now come on, buddy.
You can do this.
This is not good.
Definitely not good.
- All right!
- Whoa! Good one!
You went further that time.
- All right! Way to go, dude!
- All right, line it up.
Hey, guys, look, it's Richie Tyler.
Hey, check out his clothes. Hey,
Tyler, where you going, the moon?
Get cable in that thing, Tyler?
Hey, what's the matter, you chicken?
What's the matter, wuss, forgot your training wheels?
Uhh!
Uhh!
No cranial damage.
Oh!
Hello?
Welcome to the library, young man.
Don't tell me. You're here for a special book.
- Mister...
- Stop, stop, stop. Allow me to guess.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
You're in need of... a fantasy.
Brave knights, mythical fairies, ferocious dragons.
Look, all I want is...
Adventure!
Of course. You're a boy who loves adventure!
Brimming with wicked demons, cutthroat pirates...
No, no, that's not it.
Horror!
Horror! Evil demons!
Wretched monsters! Haunted houses!
Graveyards!
Yes.
It's horror for you, boy.
I'm sure of it.
Your library card, please.
I don't have one.
You do now.
Sign here.
Richard Tyler.
Consider this your passport to the wonderful, quite unpredictable world of books.
But I don't want any books.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I only came in here 'cause of the storm.
You mean you don't need...
Oh.
I see.
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?
Through there.
Proceed in a northeasterly direction until you get to the rotunda, and from there head west through the fiction section.
And you'll find it. A public telephone. You can't miss it.
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way, merely direct yourself back to the exit sign.
Wow!
Jeez!
Whoa! Oh!
Hello?
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Oh! Uhh!
Uhh!
Help!
Mister, mister, where's the exit?
Help!
Wha...
Huh?
I'm... I'm a cartoon!
You... are an illustration.
Who... who are you?
I am the Pagemaster, keeper of the books and guardian of the written word.
You're the guy from up there!
Where are the others?
Why, they're here, of course! And all around.
Maybe you can show me the way out?
Follow me.
I-Is that the way?
Oh, the only way.
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!
Where a boy's imagination can take root and grow to incredible heights!
Where a boy's courage is a wind that moves him to discovery!
And where your journey begins!
Uhh!
Whoa!
To find your way home, you must face three tests, horror, adventure and fantasy.
And remember this, when in doubt, look to the books!
Aah! How do you stop this thing?
I am the ghost of Christmas past...
All the pirates shared a grave.
Due to the storm, all lines have been temporarily disconnected.
Please try your call again later.
Oh! Ow!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Where's the son of a sea biscuit knocked me from me crow's nest?
Where's he be? Where's he be?
So here be the lubber who knocked me on me poop deck, and with no apologies too!
You fiction or nonfiction?
I'm... Richard. Richard Tyler.
- What kind of a book would that be?
- Uh, I'm not a book.
Got any proof?
See? Here's my name!
A library card!
Oh, begging your pardon, lad.
I didn't know you was a customer!
Uh, look, all I wanna do is get outta here.
Of course you do, matey! We all do.
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
You... you said you knew the way out?
I know these waters like the back of me hook!
Uh... Uh...
This way.
I gotta get home.
My parents are probably worried sick about me.
Well, I'm afeared
I've been dry-docked in this library far longer than I'd like to remember.
As I sees it, you with your library card are me ticket out of here!
Is it a deal, matey?
Ooh, I'm naked.
Uh, yeah, I guess so.
That's the spirit, lad!
Can we get going now?
Aye aye! Let's scale this mast and get our bearings!
Mast? That's a ladder. I kind of have this thing about heights.
Huh. I'll take care of that.
Mysterious Island. Yes.
Kidnapped.
Ah, here we be! 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea.
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!
It's a giant squid!
Ah!
Whoa!
Ohh!
Jump, boy!
It's jump for your life!
Ohh!
Uhh!
Let go of my face! I can't breathe!
What are you doing, grabbing me like that and messing up my pantyhose?
Hmph! Now I gotta straighten out my Little Mermaid underwear.
Who... who are you?
I'm Fantasy. Oh!
I'm Fantasy! What is this?
Hm.
It's a library card.
I'm a book, honey. I can read.
Now tell me, what's the one thing you wish for more than anything in the world?
Anything in the world?
L-I'd like to get out of here.
I'll grant your wish, child. But you must do me one small kindness in return.
You gotta check me outta here!
That's it? OK, let's go!
Do I have to click my heels or something?
Honey, you in the wrong story.
That was a close one, lad. Lad?
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!
- You know that short story?
- Yeah, he's adventure.
Honey, that's what they all say.
I heard that! I'll have you know I'm a classic!
Mm-hm. A classic... misprint.
Why, you old sea serpent! I'll rip out your pages and use them for... Oh, no!
Do something!
Hm.
Oops! I forgot. My wand doesn't always work outside the fantasy section.
You mean you can't wish us to the exit?
That overdue shrew's never even seen the exit.
More than you have, shorty!
In fact, the exit's just beyond my fantasy section. Hmph!
Then what are ye doing in these parts?
There a witches' convention around here, maybe?
Look, I was misshelved.
But that's over, now that young Prince
Charming here has come to check me out.
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!
Come on, boy, we're wasting time chumming off this dinghy.
It's on to the exit for us!
If he thinks the exit's in that direction, you know it's got to be in this one!
Don't listen to her, mate. She's not sailing with a full crew!
Ah-ah-ah!
Fantasy! She's a bloody nightmare.
Let's leave him. He doesn't even know where we are now!
Bilge water! Of course I know where we are! We're...
Hound of the Baskervilles.
We're in Baskervilles.
Have a look-see!
Hm. Huh?
Hey, this way! Through here!
Nice doggy! Good doggy!
Hurry!
Oh, baby.
Are we still in the library?
Aye, lad. The horror section.
It looks pretty scary.
That it does. Just stay close to me and... and you got nothing to worry about.
Mm-hm.
There it is! The exit!
Looks like the only way to reach the exit is through that there house.
No way I'm going in there.
It's your only chance, boy.
It's just a house.
Yeah, but 70 percent of all accidents are household-related.
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.
Whoa!
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.
Well? Ring the bell.
Ohh!
- Good catch!
- Here, take it.
Isn't he sweet?
Oh, I scared you.
I'm sorry!
You mustn't judge a book by its cover.
Look, he's smiling!
That's a smile?
All right, teatime's over.
Let's start navigating this house.
Huh? No, wait! Don't go in there!
It's scary inside!
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Or, of...
And... Aah!
And...
And...
Uh, I know how you feel.
Horror always has sad endings.
I come from a world of happy endings.
Why don't you come with us?
Yeah! And maybe you could help us through the house.
Through the house? Hm.
Uh.
You can do it.
'Kay.
Friend?
Oops!
Come on!
Hm?
He-hello?
A-anybody home?
What was that?
Nevermore!
Get me out of here!
May I assist you in some way?
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.
Well, sir, we did ring the bell.
It's all my fault. I was trying to help them find their way to the other side of the house.
The other side?
My boy, I derive no pleasure in telling you that you are in extreme danger.
- Danger?
- Even as we speak.
Lurking in this very room, waiting to strike, are forces of evil.
Wait for me! Wait for me!
Every man is possessed of both good... and evil.
Oh, yes.
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?
Hm?
Ah.
I'll have a go with you, doc.
Ooh!
Stay back! This is a man's drink!
Can I have the olive?
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Now look what you've done!
Whoa!
Ooh!
No! No, no! Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!
Dr... Jekyll?
Dr. J?
My name is... Mr. Hyde!
Easy, there!
The stairs, mateys, the stairs!
Ahh!
Help, master! Don't leave me!
This is no way to treat a library book. Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Honey, you got to help him!
But I... I...
Oh!
At least this wand is good for something.
Come on!
Which way?
Down. Definitely down.
No, up. Definitely up! Up, up, up!
Come on!
What's going on?
Ghost stories.
Ha ha!
Get me outta here!
Aah!
Close the door!
Whoa!
Down there? I... I can't.
Come on, boy! Even books have spines.
Come, master!
I can do this. I can do this.
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Reach deep within yourself, Richard.
Seize the courage.
Uhh! Uhh!
Whoa!
- Yay! You did it! You did it!
- Grand, boy!
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
Wow.
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.
Ha ha!
The land of adventure!
Look! There's the exit!
Hey! Wait for me!
Ha ha ha!
Home, sweet home!
There's only room for one up here.
From now on, it'll be smooth sailin'!
What are ya laughin' at?
Whoa!
Uhh!
A boat!
Is it... safe?
I wrote the book on sailin'. In fact, I am the book on sailin'.
I'm impressed.
We're sinking. We're going down!
Somebody do something!
Thank you.
Shove off, lads!
Jeez, the water looks kind of choppy.
Maybe we should've stayed back there where it was safe.
Whalin' men.
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!
Another guy with a peg leg.
Mm-hm. Seems to be a fashion statement around here.
- Did you see it?
- See what?
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.
- Hm?
- Moby Dick!
Thar she blows!
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
He's possessed!
He's insane!
He's my kind of guy!
Look!
It's headed straight for them!
Thou damned whale!
Thus, I give up the spear!
So, you think I scared it?
He shouldn't swim right after eating, you know. He'll get cramps.
Where did he go?
Aah!
Row! Row for your lives!
Guys! Where are you?
Adventure? Boy, am I ever glad to see you.
Huh?
All right, all right!
Where's Horror?
And Fantasy?
Where are they?
I searched for 'em as much as I could, mate.
I'm afraid... I'm afraid they've gone below with Davy Jones.
No. It can't be.
You guys are the only friends I've ever had.
She's a cruel sea, lad.
They gotta be out there.
Horror!
Fantasy!
Sharks!
We may be joining them other two sooner than you think.
Hey, look!
Help, help! Over here!
Careful, mate. Not all sharks are in the water.
Get us out of here!
This way! Help!
It's a good thing you guys came along.
Ohh! We're missing two others about his size. Did you see 'em?
He's all the catch we've had today.
Huh?
I knew it! It's him!
Who?
The meanest, black-hearted pirate that ever sailed the seven seas.
Long John Silver!
Just set your keel down, mate.
John Silver's expecting live company.
Uhh!
Give the word, Cap'n Silver, sir, and
I'll show you the color of his insides.
Red! Red! They're red!
Stow your cutlass, Tom Morgan.
I want a better look at his outsides first.
Long John Silver!
Aye, lad, the very same.
Well, seeing as how me men plucked you out of the water like a drownin' field rat, you'll be joinin' our happy family as our new cabin boy.
Thanks, but I already have a family.
I really should be getting home now.
Oh, I think you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.
John Silver! Touch one hair on that boy's head, and you'll be answerin' to me!
Well, come aboard, matey! Ha ha.
Uhh!
You wouldn't happen to be going after me treasure, would you, now?
You ain't got any treasure worth goin' after!
- No treasure?
- No treasure?
He's lyin'! There's plenty of treasure for all of ya!
Search him!
The boy, too.
Hm.
Why, looky here.
Here he be, Cap'n.
What might this here be?
Money! It's yours! Keep it!
- Money, he says!
- Keep it, he says!
- Hm. Library card.
- Library card?
A cabin boy don't need no library card.
I'd like to get out of here!
Land ho!
Land ho!
There she be, mateys!
Treasure Island!
Stay on your toes, mate. When they go for the gold, we'll make our break.
Quit your squawkin'!
Look to the map. What's it say?
It's, uh, in the middle, by the waterfall.
No, it's east by some broccoli.
- Give me that!
- Broccoli.
You half-wits!
It's west, by a tree!
East, by broccoli!
They're all idiots.
What sort of way is that for bones to lie?
It ain't natural.
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.
Open your eyes. The bones is the compass pointin' the way to the doubloons.
It's gone!
Dig deeper, boys!
I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!
One gold piece. This is your treasure, is it?
Let's kill him and eat his parrot.
Stand by for trouble.
We mighta known you'd double-cross us.
Throw down your weapons, John Silver!
Why, you pack of back-bitin' dogs!
You'll be regrettin' this, George Merry.
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.
16 men on a dead man's stomach...
No! No! Chest! Chest!
Chest! Chest!
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum!
Evil spirits.
Sanctuary!
Ohh.
Horror! You're alive!
Not for long. Hee hee hee hee hee!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh-Ohh!
Ahchoo!
Fantasy!
Naturally. Well, who were you expecting, honey, the tooth fairy?
Get them!
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!
Aah!
Uhh!
Get me outta here!
Hey!
Why, you...
Uhh!
Get the boat, boy. We're gonna be shovin' off.
I'm not going with you.
The sword, honey. Get the sword.
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.
Hyah! Uhh!
Stay back!
Avast there, laddie.
Somebody could get hurt with that blade you got thar.
Be careful, master.
In the boat.
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.
Ye be a hard lad, Richard Tyler.
Good sailin' to ya, shipmate.
15 men on a dead man's chest
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum
- Way to go, honey.
- Yes!
Whew. Oh, I wish my dad coulda seen me.
Boy, I thought you two were goners.
We almost were, until this enchanting fellow discovered he could float.
It's hollow.
- Who's there?
- Adventure!
Adventure who?
What do you mean, Adventure who?
Open the blasted door, you dog-eared...
Aah!
Perfect timing.
I was just thanking these guys for saving us.
I coulda taken the lot of 'em with one hand tied behind me back!
That's just his way of saying thanks.
You're welcome!
Ahoy, matey!
Aye, we're lusty adventurous men.
Go away. You don't know what you're talkin' about.
L-I know I'm not your favorite kind of book, but I could be just like you.
You'll never be Adventure!
Ye ain't got the spine for it.
And take that stupid thing off!
Sorry.
Thinks he can be a pirate!
Seize the courage, Richard, then you will reach the exit.
I'll never get home.
You did good, honey.
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.
We'll never get to the exit now.
Honey, never say "never" around Fantasy, because sometimes you've got to fight to make a wish come true.
So come on. Don't quit on me now.
Yeah.
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.
You don't see me pretending to be Horror.
Why are you sittin' around like a bunch of 0l' wenches at teatime?
Pick one.
Mmm...
That one.
My library card!
I wrestled it away from three sharks who was eyein' it for breakfast.
At no small threat to me life, neither.
Mm-hm.
Where's Horror? Wasn't he with you?
He was, but he, uh... I mean,
I sort of, uh... He, uh...
What did you say to him now?
Well, I, uh... I, uh...
I just, uh, uh...
I'll go find him.
Yeah, you better go find him.
And be quick about it!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror.
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!
You're lucky I was published with a thick hide!
Hm?
Come back, ya jellyfish!
Speak to me, mate.
Ye had a good heart and ye was braver than ye knew.
I... I'd walk the plank if I thought it would bring ye back.
That's beautiful.
Huh?
This is too cute.
Uhh!
Are you OK?
Thanks to my friend here.
Get off me!
Did you see that?
See what?
My wand! It's blinkin'!
That can only mean one thing.
The exit!
- The checkout!
- A happy ending.
Ohh!
Let's go! Come on!
Are you sure that swizzle stick of yours is workin' right?
Hm.
I don't know. Maybe we should test it.
You've gone overboard, missis!
Whatever you imagine
Is where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever you may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I could fly...
- Look! Mother Goose!
- Hey, girl!
And leave all our doubts and fears behind...
Hello, my little baby. Hi!
You see, that's just what can happen
If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Wait for me!
Hey! Come here!
Those are my glasses!
Hey! Don't go up there!
What's the matter? Is
Adventure afraid to go in?
What? I live for moments like this.
Look! There it is! The exit!
Me sword! Uhh!
Earthquake!
Quick! Find page 1,001.
Arabian Nights?
That's it!
Ohh!
Get the boy!
Come on! The exit's up there!
We're gonna make it!
- Hooray! We're gonna make...
- Aah! My wand!
Oh, baby. I wish that hadn't happened.
Come on, guys! The exit!
This way, guys!
Aah!
We're almost there!
We made it!
Guys?
This dragon is history!
Don't try to stop me!
Be careful.
Huh? Hm.
You really are a classic.
Mmm!
How would you like to curl up with a good book?
Oh, me binding!
In your dreams!
Ooh!
Adventure, up here!
Go on, lad! Save yourself!
You think a bag of hot air is enough to stop me?
Dragon? He's more like a dragonfly, he is!
Look out!
Uhh.
Happy birthday.
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!
A sword.
Yes!
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!
Bite him, bite him!
Aah!
Yah!
- Watch out for his tail!
- You've got him on the run!
Aah!
I'm not scared of you!
Aah!
Aah!
Huh?
Aah!
I gotta get out of here.
Aah!
Fantasy's wand!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Uh-oh.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books!
Alice in Wonderland.
Off with his head!
Sheesh!
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
Jack and the Beanstalk.
Yeah! This is it!
I hate heights!
Aah!
Matey!
He's alive!
Aah!
Come on, guys!
Uhh!
Whew.
Are you all right?
Wh... wha...
Master, you saved us!
That ya did, matey.
Baby, you're the greatest.
Mm-wah!
Who's there?
The Pagemaster.
Hey! How'd you get here?
Quit it! We're in the presence of the Pagemaster.
I know who he is! He's the guy who did all this to me!
Do you have any idea what I've been through?
Tell me.
I was nearly torn apart by a crazy doctor.
I was made a slave by a bunch of mangy pirates, and eaten, got that, eaten by a fire-breathing dragon!
He don't mean it, my
Pagemaster. He don't mean it.
Not to mention being tossed, squashed and scared practically to death.
Yet you stand before me.
Well... yeah.
Think, boy! What kind of an adventure would you have had if I'd brought you here with the turn of a page?
You prevailed over evil.
Ah, you looked Moby
Dick in the eye, boy.
Ah, you had pirates tough, me lad, and don't no one speak any different.
If I had brought you here from the start, you never would have found the courage to face your own fears.
And in doing so, you triumph here and always.
Hey, is that... That's me!
That was you.
I'm ready to go home now.
I mean, we're ready.
The world awaits.
Whoa!
Godspeed to you, boy!
Wait for me!
Aah!
You took quite a spill, young man.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Careful! You'll slip again!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait! Uh, I forgot something.
Here.
I'm afraid you can only check out two.
Horror? But I promised him.
You promised whom?
- Look, I need... Just this once?
- Shh.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
Just this once.
Shh.
Yes!
Good. That was definitely good.
I can't imagine where he could be.
Maybe we should call the police.
Alan!
He's home.
Alan.
It's impossible.
Rich?
We probably should put him in his bed.
Let's let him sleep up here tonight.
Love you, Richie.
Good night, son.
It's dark out here. I wish there was a night-light.
Honey, wish granted.
Ooh.
Hooray! Hooray!
Breathe it in, mateys.
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?
Because I have friends.
That you do, matey.
Aye, that you do.
Ahem.
You know what would make this a happy ending?
A kiss.
OK.
I meant from her!
When this world
The real-life world
You're livin' in
Just gets too much
For you to take
When you find
Too many troubles on your mind
And feel just like
There's no escape
And it seems your heart's forgotten
How to believe
Turn a page in your soul
Mmm, there's a place you can go
Close your eyes and let your heart
Fly free
Fly free
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Everything is...
Just a dream away
Ooh
Remember when
Remember when
A dream could take you anywhere
Anywhere you want to
Just a wish
Anything could be
When the farthest star was one more star you could reach
Take a look in your heart
'Cause that's where dreams always start
Anything is real
If you just believe
Believe, believe
Ohh, Ohh, ohh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Everything is...
Just a dream away
All it takes is faith to make your dreams come true
Oh, oh
And somewhere in this world
There'll be somebody
To share your dreams
With you
Hey
Yeah, oh, yeah
Ohh
Oh, yeah, oh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Is just a dream
Just a dream
Away
Yeah
Whatever you imagine
Can one day come to be
There are dreams to awaken
Roads to be taken
Follow them and they will set you free
Whatever you imagine
ls where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever
You may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I
Could fly past the sun
And leave all our doubts and fears
Behind us
You see, that's just what can happen
If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
- Can make your life brand-new
- Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine
Will come true
Ooh
Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes
Ah, salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today. Come on down.
Look at this. Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break. Will not...
It broke.
Ohh! Look at this.
I have never seen one of these intact before.
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen. Ah, still good.
Wait. Don't go.
I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance.
Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed.
A diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
It begins on a dark night,
where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.
You are late.
A thousand apologies,
O patient one.
You have it, then?
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ow!
Trust me, my pungent friend.
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.
Awk. Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine.
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?
Shh.
Who disturbs my slumber?
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
Know this.
Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
No!
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it. Look at this. I'm so ticked off that I'm moulting.
Patience, Iago. Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this...
Diamond in the rough.
Stop! Thief!
I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
Whoa!
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!
You think that was easy?
You two, over that way, and you, follow me.
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Trouble? No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.
And this time...
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.
Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
That's everything
One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke
- Riffraff
Street rat
Scoundrel
Take that
Just a little snack, guys
Rip him open
Take it back, guys
I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts
- You're my only friend, Abu
Who?
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime
I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it
When I got the time
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
There he is
One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block
- Stop, thief
- Vandal
- Abu
- Scandal
Let's not be too hasty
Still I think he's rather tasty
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
Wrong
Get him!
He's got a sword!
You idiots. We've all got swords.
- One jump ahead of the hoof beats
- Vandal!
- One hop ahead of the hump
- Street rat!
- One trick ahead of disaster
- Scoundrel!
They're quick, but I'm much faster
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump
Yuck! Oy!
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right.
Yum, yum!
Uh-oh.
Here. Go on. Take it.
Ah, don't. Huh?
On his way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey!
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.
Ooh!
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you.
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
Riffraff, street rat
I don't buy that
If only they'd look closer
Would they see a poor boy?
No, siree
They'd find out
There's so much more
To me
Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.
I've never been so insulted.
Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Good luck marrying her off.
Oh! Jasmine.
Jasmine!
Jasmine!
Confound it, Rajah.
So, this is why Prince
Achmed stormed out.
Oh, Father.
Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah?
You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince
Achmed, weren't you?
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.
The law says you must be married to a prince by your next birthday.
The law is wrong.
You've only got three more days.
Father, I hate being forced into this.
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.
Jasmine, it's not only this law.
I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I...
I just want to make sure you're taken care of.
Provided for.
Please try to understand.
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess any more.
Oooh! I... I...
Allah forbid you should have any daughters.
Hmm?
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Oh! Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
It's this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!
Oh!
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.
Oh. Uh, my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?
Yes. That will be pretty good.
I can't take it any more!
If I gotta choke down on one more of those mouldy, disgusting crackers...
Bam! Whack!
Calm yourself, Iago.
Then I'd grab him around the head. Whack!
Soon I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit.
And then I stuff the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Good bye.
Okay, Abu. Go.
Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you...
Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape!
Good bye.
Nice going, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish!
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
Oh, no. I don't think so.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm really very sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here you go.
You'd better be able to pay for that.
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.
- Thief!
- Please...
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.
Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
No! No, please!
Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her.
I've been looking all over for you.
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.
You, uh, know this girl?
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?
No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.
Huh? What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.
Yes, O mighty evil one.
Part, sands of time.
Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.
Yes! Yes!
There he is.
My diamond in the rough.
That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for?
Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you for stopping that man.
Uh, forget it.
So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you do kind of stand out.
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.
Wow.
Hey.
Come on. This way.
Whoa. Watch your head there.
Be careful.
Is this where you live?
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.
That sounds fabulous.
Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view.
Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
Oh, it's wonderful.
I wonder what it would be like to live there, and have servants and valets.
Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
You're not free to make your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...
- Trapped.
- Trapped.
So, where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away and I am not going back.
- Really? How come?
- Why, you...
My father's forcing me to get married.
That's... That's awful.
Abu!
What?
Abu says, uh, that's not fair.
What?
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.
And does Abu have anything else to say?
Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.
Oh, boy.
Hmm.
Tell him that's very sweet.
Here you are.
- They're after me!
- They're after you?
My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...
Then jump!
We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?
Run! Go! Get out of here!
Get this thing off of me!
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.
Let him go.
Looky here, men. A street mouse.
Unhand him, by order of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?
- Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.
That's not your concern. Do as
I command. Release him.
I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar.
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.
Jafar?
Oh, Princess.
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.
How may I be of service to you?
The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.
Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.
Oh, dear.
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...
What do you mean?
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.
What sentence?
Death.
- By beheading.
- No.
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
How could you?
So, how did it go?
I think she took it rather well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
I didn't even know his name.
She was the princess.
I can't believe it.
I must have sounded so stupid to her.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!
Abu. Down here.
Come on, help me out of these.
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.
She's gotta marry a prince.
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!
I'm a fool.
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.
Who are you?
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.
But together, perhaps we can be more.
I'm listening.
There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
Ooh!
Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.
But the law says only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.
Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.
Uh, one problem.
It's out there. We're in here.
Uh-uh. Things aren't always what they seem.
So, do we have a deal?
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs my slumber?
Uh, it is I, Aladdin.
Proceed.
Touch nothing but the lamp.
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Would you look at that!
Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan.
Abu!
Don't touch anything.
We gotta find that lamp.
Huh?
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?
Abu, what are you, crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.
Thanks.
Wait a minute. Don't go.
Maybe you can help us.
Hey! Whoa!
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
Oh!
This is it?
This is what we came all the way down here to...
Abu! No!
- Infidels!
- Uh-oh.
You have touched the forbidden treasure!
Now you will never again see the light of day!
Whoa!
Help! Help! Help!
Gotcha!
Carpet, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, this is no time to panic.
Start panicking.
Whoa!
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.
First give me the lamp.
Yes!
At last!
What are you doing?
Giving you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... Where is it?
No.
No!
Jasmine?
Oh, dearest.
What's wrong?
Jafar has done something terrible.
There, there, my dear.
We'll set it right.
Now, tell me everything.
Oh.
Aladdin. Wake up.
Aladdin.
Oh! My head.
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal!
Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
Aha!
Why, you hairy little thief.
Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.
Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out.
Aah!
Oy!
10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck.
Hang on a second.
Whoa! Whoa!
Does it feel good to be outta there.
I'm telling you, nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."
I must have hit my head harder than I thought.
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope
I didn't singe the fur.
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia.
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.
Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master.
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?
Wait a minute. I'm your master?
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?
The ever impressive, the long contained, the often imitated, but never duplicated...
Duplicated, duplicated...
Genie of the Lamp!
Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfillment.
Thank you.
- Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.
And ixnay on the wishing for more wishes.
That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres.
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Master, I don't think you quite realise what you've got here.
So why don't you just ruminate whilst
I illuminate the possibilities.
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power
In your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how
See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say
"Mr Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"
Let me take your order
Jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come on, whisper what it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me
Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service
You're the boss, the king, the shah
Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish
How 'bout a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Oh, my
No, no
My, my
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof
Hey, looky here
Ha-ha!
Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"
And then make the sucker disappear?
So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers
You got me bona fide certified
You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish?
I really wanna know
You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt
All you gotta do is rub like so
Mr Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend
You ain't never had a friend
Like me
Ah-ha-ha!
Wah-ha-ha!
You ain't never had a friend like me
Huh?
So, what'll it be, master?
You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right?
Ah, almost.
There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos.
Like?
Ah, rule number one,
I can't kill anybody.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else.
You little ponem there.
Rule number three. I can't bring people back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it.
- Hmm.
- Oh!
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.
Can't even bring people back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here.
Excuse me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And all of sudden you're walking out on me?
I don't think so, not right now.
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!
In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere.
Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet.
We're...
Outta here!
Jafar, this is an outrage.
If it weren't for all your years of loyal service...
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded.
I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar. Let's put this whole messy business behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess.
At least some good will come of my being forced to marry.
When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine?
Jasmine!
If only I had gotten that lamp.
"I will have the power to get rid of you."
To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.
Only until she finds a chump husband.
Then she'll have us banished.
Or beheaded.
Eww!
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.
What if you were the chump husband?
What?
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?
And, uh, then you become the sultan.
Oh.
Marry the shrew.
I become the sultan.
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff.
Yaaah!
Kersplat!
I love the way your foul little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic
Carpet for all your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop.
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.
Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.
Dost mine ears deceive me?
Three? You are down by one, boy.
Ah, no. I never actually wished to get out of the cave.
You did that on your own.
Well, I feel sheepish.
All right, you bad boy, but no more freebies.
Fair deal. So, three wishes.
I want them to be good.
What would you wish for?
Me?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.
- What?
- No, I can't. I...
Come on. Tell me.
Freedom.
You're a prisoner?
It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
Itty bitty living space.
Genie, that's terrible.
But, oh, to be free...
Not have to go, "Poof.
What do you need?
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"
To be my own master.
Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.
So you can guess how often that's happened.
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.
After I make my first two wishes,
I'll use my third wish to set you free.
Well, here's hopin'. All right.
Let's make some magic.
So how 'bout it? What is it you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Wrong.
I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?
Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and...
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.
She's got these eyes that just... And this hair. Wow.
And her smile...
Ami.
C'est l'amour.
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Chicken Ã  la king? Nope.
Alaskan king crab. Ow.
I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No.
Aha. "To make a prince."
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.
All right!
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!
First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century.
These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar?
No. Let's work with me here.
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?
It says mode of transportation.
Excuse me, monkey boy.
AquÃ­. Over here.
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.
What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah than riding your very own, brand-new camel?
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.
Still not enough. Let's see.
What do you need?
Yes!
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.
Whoa!
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.
Abu, you look good.
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.
But we're not through yet.
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.
Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter.
Awk. The problem with your daughter.
Oh, really?
Right here.
"If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
"then the sultan shall choose for her."
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could I choose someone she hates?
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.
"If in the event a suitable prince cannot be found..."
Jerk.
"A princess must then be wed to..."
Hmm. Interesting.
What? Who?
The royal vizier.
Why, that would be me.
But I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess.
I'm quite sure that...
Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.
Yes. Desperate measures.
You will order the princess to marry me.
I will order the princess to...
But you're so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess will marry...
What? What is that?
That music.
Jafar, you must come and see this.
Make way for Prince Ali
Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star
Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie
Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa
Strong as 10 regular men definitely
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords? Why, Prince Ali
He's got 75 golden camels
Don't they look lovely, June?
Purple peacocks, he's got 53
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you
It's a world-class menagerie
Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa
That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali
- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- He's got the monkeys
- Let's see the monkeys
- And to view them he charges no fee
He's generous
So generous
He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
With 60 elephants, llamas galore
With bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way
For Prince Ali
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.
Your Majesty,
I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.
This is my royal vizier,
Jafar. He's delighted, too.
Ecstatic.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.
Whatever.
You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to...
By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
Ooh.
I don't suppose I might...
Why, certainly,
Your Majesty. Allow me.
Sire, I must advise against this.
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
Ow, ow, ow.
Ahh! Whoa!
Look out, here I come.
Just where did you say you were from?
Oh, much farther than you've travelled, I'm sure.
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.
Hey, watch it.
Watch it with the dumb rug.
Aah!
Whew!
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.
If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!
Jasmine will like this one.
And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different from the others.
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
Your Majesty, I am
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
All of you. Standing around deciding my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down.
I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abubu.
What am I gonna do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.
I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.
So move.
Hey.
That's a good move.
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.
Genie, I need help.
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.
If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter.
- Do you got it?
- What?
No way.
If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.
Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.
I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.
How do I look?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.
So, how's our little beau doing?
Good kitty, take off.
Down, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
Do I know you?
Uh, no. No.
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.
The marketplace?
I have servants who go to the marketplace for me.
Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met.
No. I guess not.
Enough about you,
Casanova. Talk about her.
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.
Anything. Pick a feature.
Ahem. Uh, Princess
Jasmine? You're very...
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,
- punctual.
- Punctual.
- Punctual?
- Sorry.
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.
Hmm.
I'm rich, too, you know.
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A fine prize for any prince to marry.
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.
Warning! Warning!
Right. A prince like you.
And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've met.
Mayday! Mayday!
Just go jump off a balcony!
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.
Okay, fine. But remember,
"bee" yourself.
- Yeah, right.
- What?
Uh... Uh, you're right.
You aren't just some prize to be won.
You should be free to make your own choice.
I'll go now.
- No!
- What? What?
How...
How are you doing that?
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.
You, uh...
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world.
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
Yes.
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, Princess
Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place
I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you
Now I'm in
A whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes
- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise
- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share
This whole new world with you
- A whole new world
- A whole new world
- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place
For you and me
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
Nah. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like flying, either.
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.
You are the boy from the market. I knew it.
- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you? Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth. Um...
The truth is...
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um, to escape the pressures of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Well, you know, royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think?
Hmm.
Not that strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, Princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.
Abu. Abu.
Hold him.
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abubu.
Why, you...
Make sure he's never found.
Never fails. You get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.
Hello? AI?
Al! Kid, snap out of it.
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.
You have to say, "Genie, I want you to save my life." Got it?
Come on, Aladdin!
I'll take that as a yes.
Up scope.
Don't you scare me like that.
Genie, I, uh...
I...
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.
Not that I wanna pick out curtains or anything.
Jasmine.
Oh, Father, I just had the most wonderful time.
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.
I have chosen a husband for you.
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.
Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How in the... Uh. Awk!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.
What? Ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.
He is obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
Father, what's wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh, my!
Your Highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this.
What? Jafar?
You, you traitor!
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
Guards! Guards!
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.
Just dig a grave for both of us. We're dead.
Arrest Jafar at once.
This is not done yet, boy.
Find him! Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor, plotting against me all this time.
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...
Huh?
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.
I won't. I'll leave that to my...
But you two will be wed at once.
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan.
- Sultan?
- Yes.
A fine upstanding youth such as yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We gotta get outta here. I gotta start packing. Only essentials.
We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives, and how about this picture?
I think I'm making a weird face in it.
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!
Good grip.
Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin.
- He has the lamp, Iago.
- Why, that miserable...
But you are going to relieve him of it.
Me?
Sultan?
They want me to be Sultan?
Huzzah!
Hail the conquering hero
Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess.
What are you gonna do next?
Psst. Your line is, "I'm going to free the genie."
Any time.
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.
You just go, "Genie,
I wish you free."
I'm serious.
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.
The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you.
What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.
I can't wish you free.
Fine. I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else.
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.
Genie, I'm really sorry.
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.
What are you guys looking at?
Look, I... I'm sorry.
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...
Wait. Come on.
What am I doing?
Genie's right.
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?
Well, here goes.
Jasmine? Where are you?
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
I'm coming.
You got a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.
"Excellent work, Iago."
Ah, go on.
"No, really. On a scale of one to 10, you are an 11."
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.
People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.
Jasmine.
Ali, where have you been?
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.
The whole kingdom's turned out for Father's announcement.
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.
Ali Ababwa!
Oh, boy.
Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
Let them cheer.
You know, Al, I'm getting really...
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I wish to rule on high as sultan.
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?
Father.
Jafar, you vile betrayer.
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.
The lamp.
Finders keepers, Abubu.
Genie, no!
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.
Jafar, I order you to stop.
Ah, but there's a new order now.
My order.
Finally, you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!
Genie, my second wish...
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!
Genie, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.
Down, boy.
Oh, Princess.
There's someone I'm dying to introduce you to.
Jafar. Get your hands off her.
Prince Ali
Yes, it is he
But not as you know him
Read my lips
And come to grips with reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali
Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...
So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin
Just a con, need I go on
Take it from me
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing
On a one-way trip
Genie!
So his prospects
Take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the Earth, whoopee!
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.
Ex-Prince Ali
Abu.
Abu!
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.
- Abu. Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Abu.
I made a mess of everything.
Somehow, I gotta go back and set things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! All right!
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here's your cracker. Shove them all the way down your throat.
Here. Have lots.
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.
It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my dear?
Why, with you as my queen...
Never.
I'll teach you some respect.
No. Genie.
I have decided to make my final wish.
I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas, some quid pro quos...
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.
You will do what I order you to do, slave.
Jafar.
I never realised how incredibly handsome you are.
Mmm. That's better.
Now, pussycat, tell me more about myself.
You're tall, dark, well dressed...
AI. AI, little buddy.
Shh.
Al, I can't help you.
I work for SeÃ±or Psychopath now. What are you gonna do?
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? I'll improvise.
Cute little gaps between your teeth.
Go on.
And your beard is so twisted.
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jafar...
And the street rat?
What street rat?
Yech!
That was...
You!
How many times do I have to kill you, boy?
Get the lamp.
No!
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...
Don't toy with me.
Abu!
Things are unravelling fast now, boy.
Get the point?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?
A snake, am I?
Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be.
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake
You stay out of this.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... Great!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, hang on.
You little fool.
You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.
The genie. The genie.
The genie has more power than you'll ever have.
What?
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.
Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?
Face it, Jafar. You're still just second best.
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy. He's a little punch-drunk.
One too many hits with the snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!
All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al.
Yes.
Yes!
The power.
The absolute power!
- What have you done?
- Trust me.
The universe is mine to command, to control!
Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't you forgetting something?
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
You're the genie. I don't want...
Itty bitty living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Ahh!
Get your blasted beak out of my face.
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me.
Ten thousand years in a Cave of
Wonders ought to chill him out.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince.
I know why you did.
Well, I guess this is good-bye?
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.
I love you.
Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.
Just say the word and you're a prince again.
But, Genie, what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.
This is love.
Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.
Believe me, I know. I've looked.
Jasmine, I do love you, but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not.
I understand.
Genie, I wish for your freedom.
One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.
- What?
- Genie, you're free.
I'm free. I'm free.
Quick. Quick. Wish for something outrageous.
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!
I'm free! I'm free at last!
I'm hittin' the road. I'm off to see the world. I'm...
Genie, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.
Me, too, Al.
No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me.
That's right.
You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned.
It's that law that's the problem.
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?
From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.
Him. I choose...
I choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
Oh, all of you, come over here. Big group hug.
Group hug.
Mind if I kiss the monkey?
Ooh, hairball.
Well, I can't do any more damage around this Popsicle stand.
I'm outta here!
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.
No, I'm mythology.
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
A whole new world
A whole new life
For you and me
A whole new world
Made you look.
You have been a fabulous audience.
Tell you what, you're the best audience in the whole world.
Take care of yourselves.
Good night, Alice!
Good night, Agrabah! AdiÃ³s, amigos!

I remember a world with no wars... no warriors.
All that has changed.
Now I see a dying land.
And the enemy grows stronger.
Is there someone with the courage... to step f orward?
But I f ear f or him... as I f ear f or us.
Ryan! Breakf ast is on the table.
I've gotta run, honey.
Be back around 5:00.
Bye.
Shoot.
Bravo, no.
Look, where's Ryan?
Go on. You go find him.
Make sure he eats his breakf ast.
Yeah.
What?
Do you mind?
Dog.
Yeah.
- Hey, Ryan!
- Yeah?
To your right.
Have I told you about the real kung fu masters?
Then let go of your limitations.
Imagine a world beyond anything you've ever seen.
A world of no worries, of perf ect bliss, where anything can happen.
A world def ended by great warriors.
No guns, no lasers, no morphing.
They use the f orces of nature as their weapons.
Fire, metal... wood... water... and earth.
Warriors who fight f or integrity and honor... sail upon their enemies with the grace of a dancer... and knock them senseless... with the touch of a f eather.
Well, it's cooking time.
Hey, Ming.
Are they real?
Ancient Chinese secret.
Red f or 12!
Set, hut!
- Go!
- Go, Ken!
- We can still win.
- There's no way they can make it.
Time out!
- Red team.
- Ryan, Chucky, today!
Coming, Coach.
- Guys, we have time f or one more play.
- Here you go.
We're gonna sweep left. No, we're gonna sweep right. Toby, you get the ball.
No way, Coach. Left tackle's been bustin' through the line all game.
Hey, I've played a f ew games in my day, son. Okay?
I said sweep right, so we're gonna sweep right. Now let's go!
- We can do it.
- Yeah, it's a good play.
- Brad.
- Guys, throw 'em over here.
Thanks.
Their right saf ety comes in on every running play.
If you f ake to Toby, then bootleg left, you have a clear path to the end zone.
Sure, "Coach."
All right. Ready!
- Break!
- Gimp!
Let's go, Ry.
Blue 42! Go!
Hut!
All right! Way to go!
Wow!
Yes!
All right!
Nice call.
Thanks, Chucky.
You got dissed, man.
It was your call.
What's the diff erence?
You. That's the whole point.
- You made the diff erence.
- Watch out!
Hey, we're walkin' here!
Hey, Brad!
Ryan called your winning play.
Aren't you gonna thank him?
Did you say somethin', or did you f art?
Ryan called the play.
You heard him.
And he told you exactly what to do.
Oh, really? I thought you said that was your ingenious idea.
Bootleg left, clear path to the end zone.
- That was a great call, man.
- Thanks.
Too bad you can't play ball.
You're pretty smart.
Come on.
Let's get lost.
Wait a second.
You want to hang out with us tonight?
- Yeah. Sure.
- Cool.
Well, we'll be around the Orono tunnel about 8:00.
- Great. We'll be there.
- All right.
You too, Upchuck.
Break.
You got a death wish, man?
I mean, the guy's evil.
Lucif er thinks he's a little extreme.
- He's up to somethin'.
- So you're not comin'?
I didn't say that.
After all, you're the man.
See you there.
Pass!
Touchdown!
An incredible pass from the man simply known as...
"Ry."
- Darn.
- Hey, Mom.
The man I was looking f or.
Dinner's almost served.
Fabulous frozen. Got a showing in 20 minutes, so you'll have to eat alone.
- How was your game?
- We won.
Brad got a touchdown on the last play.
- I came up with the play.
- Really?
Hey, that's great.
I'm very proud of you.
Proud of what?
I didn't score the touchdown.
That's okay.
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is. You're a part of that team.
And it sounds to me like they couldn't have won without you.
When's Dad getting back?
Now, are you saying that your f ather is a better cook than your mother?
No off ense.
Oh, yes, you are gonna need something.
- How about Min's? My treat.
- Ming, Mom.
You've only been there a hundred times.
Yeah, Ming. I know.
Look, your mama's losing her mind, going in and out of that door all day long.
You bear with me a little longer?
I'll be back in a couple hours.
Sorry.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
You okay, Mr. Lang? It's slippery here.
You gotta watch your step.
- What's goin' on?
- Oh, nothin'.
Come on.
- What's got you singin' the blues?
- Nothin'.
Come on.
I got somethin' f or you.
- What is it?
- Come on.
I'll be right there.
What's this?
Oh, I f ound that when I was about your age.
It's a cocoon.
I was on my way home from school.
I saw it lying on the ground, just sitting there... moving around, something inside.
I got on my hands and knees and looked close... and I see this moth struggling to get out.
But he couldn't do it. So I reached down and tore open the cocoon.
And out he came.
Takes off into the air and flies away.
But then, all of a sudden, down he came into the ground.
Dead.
What happened?
I interrupted his journey.
We all have cocoons.
The struggle to free ourselves makes us whole and gives us the strength to fly.
It's pretty hard to fly when you have a broken wing.
Always so certain of that, aren't you?
Ancient Chinese secret, remember?
- A book?
- No, a manuscript.
I was like you once.
Never f elt I was good enough.
Always wanted to be like someone else.
But this-- this helped me become the person I wanted to be.
A cook?
No. Myself.
This is Tao.
It means the way to something, yourself, being the person you want to be.
I got all the self-help books I need from my mom. She doesn't get it either.
This isn't like the books your mom gave you.
I gotta go.
Check it out.
- It's yours.
- Catch you later.
Man, this place makes me itch.
- This is creepy. Let's get outta here.
- What?
This is our ticket, so don't blow it.
We're in.
So you boys decided to show up.
So what are we gonna do here?
We're gonna play f ollow the leader.
You're the leader.
- It's a bad idea.
- Just relax, okay?
No. See? I told you somethin' was up.
And I bet it's gonna get worse.
I bet they're gonna carve their initials into our chest... or make hot dogs out of our wieners.
- Hot dogs with meatballs on the side.
- Shut up.
Me, oh, my. You know, I just remembered,
I have a Spanish test tomorrow.
To hang with us, you gotta be initiated.
Come on, you wussies! Let's go!
- All right, guys.
- Wait.
All right.
Now, this is simple.
All you gotta do is walk across and give us an autograph.
- Make your mark.
- You said you wouldn't make him do it.
He can't.
- Don't listen to him.
- We all did it.
You want in? It's up to you.
- Don't.
- He's a wussy.
- Don't do it.
- Don't.
Fine. I'll meet you on the other side.
- Baby!
- All right, man. Come on!
Take a swim today?
Shut up!
- Watch out.
- Don't slip, man.
- Watch it!
- Yeah!
Come on! Yeah!
Come on, Jeff ers.
Are you cool?
Let's go.
Come on, buddy.
Come on.
He's just making fun of you.
Man, this is stupid.
Make like Tom and "cruise."
Shut up. I can do this, okay?
Look, he did it.
Yeah. But you're not him.
- Damn.
- Let's go!
- He's picking up the can.
- Are you afraid?
- Come on!
- Come on down.
- Don't do it!
- Shut up.
- Come on. You got it.
- You got it. Keep goin'.
You guys, don't distract him.
- He's gonna f all in!
- Hey, big guy, you got it.
Come on.
Come on! You got it.
What are you doing?
Go f or it!
You're movin' like a baby! Why don't you just get down and crawl? Come on!
- Stop it!
- Come on.
Come on! You got it!
- Don't look down!
- That's it. Yes!
Hey, you see that?
- What?
- He's freakin'.
You never know when it's gonna take a dump. You gotta be quick.
Come on! Let's go.
You gotta be quick.
Come on!
What is that?
Grab him!
- Oh, my God!
- Get him out!
What--
Dry?
Tracy?
Come on, guys.
Cut it out.
Look, this isn't funny.
Bravo!
Hey, you!
Gotcha!
Oh, my God.
It works.
My leg.
It works.
It works! Yes!
Set!
Blue 42!
Set! Hike!
Jeff ers spins past the def enders!
Oh, he cuts back, spinning, stiff-arming!
Back to the sidelines.
He goes.
He's spinning past the def enders.
Split the stiff-arm!
Spins again.
Fumble! But Jeff ers recovers.
He spins back to mid-field.
At the ten! The five--
- Get off me!
- You're not getting away, Newcomer!
- Let go! No!
- No such luck.
Let go, punk.
Hold your blade!
Who's there?
- Are you hurt?
- He's a Newcomer, Elysia.
Came right up out of the river.
I saw it with my own eyes.
And he's mine!
You're really a Newcomer?
I just f ell in the water.
I slipped, and then those things... they came out, and they tried to kill me.
Those were Komodo's men.
We're not saf e here.
Come on.
Elysia, a little reward f or my eff orts?
Virtue be yours!
Your patrol was sent to spy on their Lif espring, Commander.
- You were not supposed to be seen.
- General, we were attacked.
Well, you can explain it to him yourself.
He's not happy.
Bye-bye!
Commander.
Failure... is in your eyes.
An open wound inf ects like a disease... and it spreads... like an inf ection.
I smell f ear.
Fear of what?
Death?
My lord... please.
Look.
I brought you this.
It's from a boy.
He's a Newcomer.
Newcomer?
Rise.
Slowly stand up.
Don't be afraid.
I want to take away your terror.
There is nothing to f ear... because... nothing dies.
Listen.
Lif e... is but a dream... flowing into another dream.
Bye.
General Grillo...
I ask you this:
What's the point of power... if you don't abuse people?
Open it.
My lord, it's the symbol of Tao!
Could this be the-- the manuscript?
Lieutenants!
At last.
Find this Newcomer and bring him to me.
Pleasure, my lord.
Alive.
Who are you?
Where am I?
I'm Elysia.
You're in Tao.
- Tao?
- Yes, Tao.
The manuscript. I thought it was just a story. I didn't believe him.
What manuscript?
What does it look like?
- That. It has that on the cover.
- The Manuscript of Legend?
- The what?
- The Manuscript of Legend.
Master Chung once told us about an ancient book that had special powers.
He said, if it was ever returned to Tao, it could change everything.
- Who's Master Chung?
- He's our leader.
When he came to Tao, he taught ways of peace and harmony.
But it didn't last.
Komodo began mining the Lif espring f or a mineral called zubrium.
The Lif esprings are where we live.
They radiate energy to all of Tao.
Without zubrium they die out.
Komodo uses the zubrium to keep himself young and strong.
That's why he's so desperate f or it.
Now only one Lif espring remains.
Can't anyone stop him?
No, not even the Warriors of Virtue.
Warriors? Kung fu?
What do they look like?
They're Rooz.
This is our Lif espring.
Listen to me, citizens of Tao.
Please calm yourselves.
- We cannot let our f ears def eat us.
- We must remain calm.
The Warriors of Virtue will protect us!
But Master Chung, has Yun returned?
He has not.
Then how can the Warriors of Virtue protect us... if there are only f our of them?
Komodo's soldiers have already been spotted inside the green.
- What are we going to do?
- We're doomed!
Oh, we're dead!
Listen to me, please!
Master Chung, we have hope.
- A Newcomer has arrived.
- Newcomer?
He's too small to be a Newcomer.
Houston, we have a problem.
Newcomer, Elysia said you have brought the manuscript.
May I see it?
It is important, Newcomer.
The name is Ryan Jeff ers.
Show me the Warriors of Virtue, please?
I trained these five warriors to protect Tao.
Each upholds honor... and integrity.
Do they fight with kung fu?
They use the f orce of nature's elements: wood, fire... earth, metal... and water.
Ming was right.
This is Lai, virtue of order... the stability of wood.
Meticulous, logical... often a bit cranky.
Tsun, the virtue of Ioyalty... security of earth.
Kind and nurturing.
Chi, virtue of high wisdom... power of fire.
Often playful... but very wise.
Yee, virtue of righteousness... strength of metal.
He does not speak, seeing every choice as right or wrong.
- Nothing in between.
- You said there were five.
Yes. The other is Yun... their leader.
Virtue of benevolence, f orce of water.
Where is he?
Yun has lost his will to fight.
God, they're so cool.
Uh-oh.
But not ready!
Don't be afraid.
This is Yee.
Ryan. How's it goin'?
It's all right.
This is Chi...
Tsun... and Lai.
He is a Newcomer, and he has brought something important to us.
Now, Ryan Jeff ers, may we see the manuscript?
Look, I don't have it.
One of you guys has it.
Us?
When you saved me from Komodo's soldiers, it was in my backpack.
- At the river. Remember?
- Backpack? What's a backpack?
Yun knows where it is.
If the Newcomer was saved at the river, it would have been Yun.
- Forget Yun.
- But what if he can help?
Yun does not care about our cause anymore. He will not help.
In this struggle, all five of you must work together.
We must find Yun.
Without the Manuscript of Legend... we cannot def eat Komodo.
What are you thinking about?
Home.
I wonder if my mom and dad are worried about me.
What are your parents like?
I don't know.
No. They're pretty cool.
I mean, they're nice.
I wish I'd known my mother and f ather.
They died just after my brother and I were born.
Master Chung looked after us.
Where is your brother?
He was recently killed.
I'm sorry.
You must've been a great leader in your world to be trusted... with the Manuscript of Legend.
Not really.
I was just a bad f ollower.
- But I'd sure like to show them now.
- Show them what?
That I can run, play f ootball... just like everyone else!
What?
Nothing. I just think
I f ound a friend.
So have I.
Come on. There's something
I want to show you.
- What?
- Come on!
All this was built in honor of the Rooz.
During the Old Order, they were revered by everyone.
- How come Yee doesn't talk?
- He used to.
But after the war in Tao started... he saw so much suff ering that he hasn't spoken since.
Why'd Yun leave everyone?
- He killed someone in the battle.
- So what? It was a battle. People die.
It was a lif e!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.
It's just that the Warriors of Virtue made a creed never to kill.
But Yun--
Someday you'll understand.
Understand what?
You remind me of my brother.
He's alway--
Let go of me!
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!
- Move it.
- Help!
Help!
- Hey, Yun.
- Let go!
Come to play?
Where's your sword?
You killed anyone today?
Mantose! Get up!
Barbra-Rotious, this way!
You're Yun, aren't you?
I'm Ryan, the Newcomer.
You saved me at the river, remember?
Can I have the manuscript?
I need to bring it back to them.
The Manuscript of Legend?
You mean, you don't have it?
Then Komodo must have it.
You have to help them get it back.
Master Chung says they need you.
Come on. Let's go.
You don't understand.
Where are you going?
You're supposed to be one of them!
Honor! Integrity! Remember?
You can't run away f orever!
No wonder they gave up on you.
Wimp!
Lai was right.
He doesn't care.
- Let's go.
- Cool.
It can't be.
Irrational.
Cool.
Thank you, Ryan.
Tsun, l--
I knew you'd return.
- Thanks.
- There was always wisdom in your heart.
Welcome home.
You should not have left.
Order has been disrupted.
I was wrong.
The Newcomer helped me realize that.
Come on.
It is good you've returned.
Thank you.
Tell them about the manuscript.
Komodo has it.
We will never stop Komodo now.
Its knowledge is his.
That's not so.
It's good to see all of you together again.
Forgive me.
The Newcomer brought the manuscript.
He is the only one with the eyes to see what is written.
Me?
Master, on my lif e, I will get the manuscript back from Komodo.
Yun is back!
The Warriors of Virtue are united again!
Thank you, Ryan!
My lord, all the zubrium has been mined from this Lif espring.
The army stands at readiness.
The only question is, what do we do since Yun has returned?
Do not think thoughts.
The Rooz were born to die.
Even reunited, they cannot def eat me.
Isn't that why they seek the manuscript? Yes, it is.
- My lord, f orgive--
- Do not... think thoughts.
Outside, anxiety exists.
And where there is anxiety... there is error.
And where there is error... there is opportunity.
They're panicking!
Do not think thoughts!
Let them make their mistake.
Forgive me, my lord... but if the manuscript can harm us, why don't we just destroy it?
It cannot be destroyed.
You can be destroyed.
Your armies can be destroyed.
But it cannot be destroyed!
Get out.
Get away from me!
General Grillo.
My lord?
Can I survive when I have destroyed the last Lif espring in Tao?
And do you expect me to stay in a world where I cannot survive?
No, my lord.
Another world is waiting.
The manuscript... will help us to get to this other world.
Then why do we need the Newcomer?
Well, because he is the teller of tales.
And I do not see f ailure in your eyes.
The Newcomer shall be yours, my lord.
General.
Do--
Does purple suit me?
Very much, my lord.
Then you are dismissed.
I don't like it. We should tell
Master Chung what we're doing.
- There's no time.
- Just listen to what she's saying.
But Komodo can attack us at any time.
- He said to be patient.
- Patience is not my virtue.
If all of us go, there will be chaos.
And I made a pledge to protect these people. We can't leave them def enseless.
I let the manuscript f all into Komodo's hands... and I made a pledge to Master Chung.
I will go myself.
- I'll go with you too.
- What about me?
Master Chung says I'm the only one who can read the manuscript.
That would be unwise.
What did he say?
Yee said we must keep you from harm.
You're a friend.
Relax. It's just a cool way to shake hands.
Okay. You're gettin' it.
You got it.
All right.
Good luck.
Thank you, Mosely.
Do I look like a baby-sitter?
The next time, why don't you volunteer to get us something to eat?
Your stupid ideas.
If I hear one more thing come out of your mouth--
Your breath stinks.
Never mind.
My lord,
Elysia is here.
Your guilt is obscene.
It was a lif e!
Yield to vengeance.
Medication time.
-The Newcomer has taken a liking to you.
-Yes.
And you care f or him.
- He has f allen under my spell.
- A wicked spell it is.
What are you afraid of?
- Not you.
- That's my girl.
Oh, yes.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
That's Yun's sword.
Nobody touches Yun's sword.
Not even Yun, anymore.
Know what I mean?
You again.
What do you want?
I've got a deal f or you, Newcomer.
- I've got something you want.
- What?
I'm not telling until I get something in return.
- Tell me now, partner.
- Take it easy. Whoa!
I'll tell you.
I've got the manuscript.
You what?
Stole it right out from under Komodo's nose.
- Show it to me.
- Are you crazy?
It's hid, hid where no one's gonna find it but me.
But I'll take you there.
I have to tell them.
You're not listenin' to me.
The manuscript's not theirs.
It's yours.
Look, once they use up all the power, how are you gonna get home?
You wanna stay here f orever?
Never see your f amily, friends?
Ever?
Now, take it from me, Newcomer.
It's now or never.
No. Look, I can't leave them.
They need me here.
Fine.
You're not interested?
I'll ask someone else.
Mudlap.
Wait.
A small reward f or my eff orts.
It's a good watch.
Well, it's better than nothin'.
Come on.
Hey, wait up!
Where are we?
- Let go!
- Welcome to the other side.
- Thanks, General Grillo.
- Jerk!
- Virtue be yours.
- Let go!
Let go of my arm!
My arm, you punk! Let go!
That is not your way.
Komodo's lies have blinded your vision.
But the truth is still there.
In your heart.
The manuscript.
It's too easy.
What? Hmm?
Protectors of Tao, weak... vulnerable.
What are you doing here?
Oh, are you really that surprised, Yun?
Virtue of Benevolence who kills?
- It was an accident!
- Enjoy your restitution.
Please, Elysia.
Don't let him destroy our Lif espring.
I should have listened to Tsun.
Rooz!
Thank you f or hanging around.
I have concocted a recipe... f or kangaroo stew.
First... simply chop the meat into many tiny little pieces... and sprinkle with a hint of benevolence.
Don't--
Marinate in wisdom f or many, many, many years.
Add just a touch... of order!
And let it simmer... in righteousness.
Goes down very well with a... nice cold vial of zubrium.
My lord, please!
Growl. Roll over.
- Beg!
- Please!
Go away.
Komodo, you f orgot Ioyalty.
Loyalty... only lasts so long.
Then it spoils.
Chi... your stupidity astounds me.
You come uninvited into my lair... animals that you are.
Like animals, I shall serve you up as supper... to my close friend... and most honored guest... ladies and gentlemen... the Newcomer!
No! Not Ryan!
It was Master Chung.
Chung. Ah.
- He took the Newcomer from me.
- We've got to get out of here.
I'll add just a dash of old man to the dish.
And I'll enjoy your Lif espring f or dessert!
Yes!
General Grillo.
Drink.
- Do it.
- Hmm?
Is it worth it, Grillo?
General Grillo!
You belong with us, like it was when we were young.
You f orget, Yun.
Even then we played on opposite sides.
We were still friends.
Drop them!
Good boy, General!
Chi, give us some light here.
Uh-oh.
Don't anyone move.
Yee, don't panic!
Oh, no.
Problem.
Yee, the ring!
Yee, is that a tunnel?
Let's get out of here.
Forget the ring. Let's go!
Don't panic.
We've got you!
Ready, Chi? On three.
One, two... three!
Go, go, go!
Will the manuscript really get me home?
Yes, Ryan.
By helping the Rooz... you will find your way home.
What about my leg?
What matters is not what you gain there... but in your heart.
I want it to be strong, like it is now.
Do you consider the Warriors of Virtue strong?
Yeah. Look at them.
Their strength is not in what you see.
It is in their virtue.
That is their Kung.
What's Kung?
Kung is your energy... your inner strength.
It can be positive or negative.
Those like Komodo use negative Kung... to kill and destroy.
But if you can bring your virtues together within yourself... you will create positive Kung.
With that, you will always have the power... to do the right thing.
If no one else can read the manuscript, how will I be able to?
The answer lies within you.
When I tell you to run, take that path and go.
Do not stop until you get to the Lif espring.
- Who's that?
- It's Komodo.
You should go now. Run!
Where are you going, Newcomer?
Eat this, sucker!
Master Chung!
Come on!
Master Chung, help!
I ask you one last time.
I am in hell.
It's my prison.
How can I be free?
The only hells in this world... are in your heart... where all the battles must be f ought.
Get out of here!
Are you all right?
There are too many of them. We must leave. We've got to get out of here.
Stupid Rooz!
Oh, no.
We shouldn't have left.
There's no time f or blame, Chi.
- We must find the others.
- There's only one place still saf e.
What are you doing here?
Ryan, I wanted to tell you.
No, you're on his side.
- You're a traitor!
- No, Ryan.
Listen to me, Ryan.
Let me explain.
No. Master Chung is dead.
I saw him die.
How can you do this to them?
They protected you.
Protect with their creed not to kill... ever?
Well, they did kill.
Yun killed.
- It was one of the bad guys.
- It was my brother.
I don't believe you.
You're lying.
It's over now.
Yun, the others, they're dead.
- Komodo killed them.
- Shut up!
- Just shut up, Elysia!
- But it's okay f or you.
No, it's not. You set me up.
You said you were my friend.
No, you get to go home, right?
Oh, Ryan, please, listen to me.
Do what Komodo says.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Please? Listen--
Looking f or me?
I know your sorrow.
I know... your Ioneliness.
Look at me!
I am everything you can become.
I am... your darkest thoughts, Ryan.
And I am proud to be your destiny.
No one will ever laugh at you again.
I promise you that.
Let's go home... with your new leg.
Ryan Jeff ers... touchdown.
Open the book.
My lord.
The last Lif espring is now completely under our control.
But the Rooz have escaped, all of them.
Go away.
Get out!
Read me the book.
What does it say?
What does it say?
Do it, Ryan. Please.
Read it to me!
Do it.
You'll get to go home.
Read the words!
Shit happens.
- Shit--
- Happens.
Shit happens.
You can't read the book, can you?
Can you?
Komodo, please, give him another chance.
You mean nothing to me!
No one touches my master.
I want him alive!
Willy Beest! Mosely! Help!
Hey, guys.
- All right.
- Virtue be yours!
Good-bye, Master Chung.
I don't want to see it anymore.
I don't want to be here.
I don't want to see death.
I just want to go home.
Will this help?
Get out of here, creep.
Gee, come on, take it.
It'll make you f eel better.
Make me f eel better?
A watch?
Yeah, probably f or you.
All you care about is your stupid little things and your rewards.
You don't know what's important.
All you care about is how much you get.
Just get out of here. You sold me out.
You sold yourself out. Go away.
I just want to help.
I don't need your help.
Get out of here, you two-f oot creep!
The Rooz need your help.
They're at the Temple Ruin.
Search harder.
- Leave no crevice unexplored.
- We've done that already.
- Just do it!
- Whatever.
General Grillo!
The manuscript.
We have searched everywhere, my lord, but--
Then you have not looked everywhere... have you?
Find it.
- Get out!
- Go!
I can't help you.
I tried to read it, but it's empty.
There's nothing.
It's empty.
I'm sorry.
I tried to read it... but I can't.
Yee's right.
This is our home.
Live or die.
It's time, Yun.
Why not?
You've come uninvited into our Lif espring, Komodo.
This is our home.
We want it back.
Warriors... come out and play!
What?
Where is he?
Rooz!
Oh, no. Five.
Still nothing to say?
Then I will be your voice!
Lai.
The center cannot hold.
Things f all apart.
You're just illusion, Komodo.
Uh-oh.
Betrayal... is f ar more alluring, Tsun.
How can I help the Rooz?
The answer lies within you, Ryan.
Master Chung?
Help me.
Five is one. Positive Kung.
To take a lif e, you lose a part of yourself.
He lost his power.
That's it.
I am cruelty!
Can you stop me, Yun?
Are you ready to kill again...
Virtue of Benevolence?
Eat this!
Yun, where is Komodo?
What do we do now?
Master?
Yun, why didn't you listen to me?
You act in such haste.
The Lif espring is gone.
Master, I've f ailed you.
Please, tell me what to do now.
Now you can go to hell!
No, Yee. He'll break his neck.
Hey, Komodo!
Looking f or this?
Remember me? I'm your friend.
And I'm proud to be your destiny.
Chi, five is one! Positive Kung!
Do it now!
The medallions!
- Water!
- Fire!
- Wood!
- Earth!
- Is everyone all right?
- Yeah.
Yee!
Ryan.
- Did it work?
- Mm-hmm.
- It worked.
- What's this?
I can read the manuscript.
Chi.
Five is one.
Positive Kung.
To take a lif e, you lose a part of yourself.
Ryan sacrificed himself to save us.
Komodo expended his energy... trying to kill Ryan with negative Kung.
It weakened him.
You made the diff erence, Ryan.
It gave us time to combine our f orces to def eat him.
Oh, no!
General Grillo, it's over.
Join us in peace.
It's the only way.
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
- I'm--
- Komodo?
I'm lost, and could someone please tell me the way?
How do I get home?
This is your home.
The Lif espring is alive!
General?
Release all the villagers.
Thank you.
Yee talked.
Ryan.
Are you in or out, Jeff ers?
Don't stand there like a dork!
Ryan, he's just making fun of you.
Man, this is stupid.
Let's make like Tom and "cruise."
Why not?
I can't believe it!
What are you doing?
Finally. I'm glad you came to your senses.
We got a lot to talk about.
Let's get out of here.
Jeff ers, you'll never make the cut!
Pansy ass!
Shut up, Brad!
Tracy, save it!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Get me out of here! Help!
Quick!
I don't know.
We've gotta help him.
What are you looking at, you wussies?
Get me out of here!
Swim hard, Brad.
You think we ought to call 9-1-1?
Definitely.
How was your night?
Virtuous.
So how many houses did you sell?
Oh, at least 12.
We're set f or lif e.
Good night, honey.
Good night.
Mom?
I love you.
I love you too.
"Spread your wings."
Shake.
Good boy, Bravo.
Hey, Bravo, do you want to hear about Tao?

Somebody asked me:
"Phil, if you could be anywhere, where would you be?"
I said to him,
"Probably right here...
...Elko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.
In California, they'll have warm weather tomorrow...
...gang wars and some overpriced real estate.
In the Pacific Northwest, they'll have some...
...very, very tall trees.
Clear across the Rockies and Great Plains.
But look out, here comes trouble.
Oh, boy!
Front coming our way!
Look out!
What will that mean to us?
One of these big, blue things!
This cold, frigid arctic air, this big mass out of the north.
It'll meet up with all this moisture out of the Gulf.
They'll mix at high altitudes and cause snow.
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It'll push off and hit Altoona.
Close call!
Let's look at the five-day.
As you can see, nothing to be too scared about.
Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home.
I won't be here at 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.
I'll be in Punxsutawney for our country's oldest groundhog festival.
According to the legend, tomorrow, February 2nd...
...if the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow...
...we've got six more weeks of winter.
Sounds like fun.
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.
Four, Nan.
Four.
Thanks, Phil.
Next, our entertainment editor looks at sex and violence in movies.
Stay with us.
We're clear.
Have fun in Punxsutawney.
For your information, Hairdo, a major network is interested in me.
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.
That was nice, Phil.
" Big trees"!
Stop, Kenny.
Look, can you handle the 10:00 or not?
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!
Rita thinks it'd be a great idea...
...to stay for other events.
You'll get incredible footage.
The people and the fun.
The excitement!
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.
I think she'll be a really good producer.
You guys are going to have fun.
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I'll be here for the 5:00.
Can you keep a secret, Larry?
I'm probably leaving PBH.
So this will be the last time...
...we do the Groundhog together.
What's wrong with the Groundhog Festival?
In San Diego...
...I covered the swallows returning to Capistrano for six years.
Someone will see me interview a groundhog, think I have no future.
I think it's a nice story.
He comes out.
He looks around.
He wrinkles up his nose.
He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! People like it!
You are new, aren't you?
People like blood sausage too.
People are morons!
Nice attitude.
Look in the mirror and see how you look when you do that groundhog thing.
For me? Once?
He comes out, and there he looks at his little shadow.
Want some blood sausage?
I have some...
I like blood sausage.
Rita, I can't stay here.
Prima donna.
- What's the matter?
- I hate this place.
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.
- I won't stay here.
- You're not staying here.
I'm not?
Larry's dropping me off.
I booked you in a nice bed-and-breakfast.
Great.
I think this is one of the traits of a good producer.
Keep the talent happy.
Anything I can do.
Would you help me with my pelvic tilt?
Within reason. Want to come to dinner with Larry and me?
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.
Don't be late.
Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.
- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!
- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!
Expect hazardous travel later today with...
... that blizzard thing.
That blizzard thing.
Here's the report.
The National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing.
There's another reason today's especially ex citing...
Especially cold.
The big question on everybody's lips...
- Their chapped lips.
- On their chapped lips.
Will Phil come out and see his shadow?
- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!
It's Groundhog Day!
Get up and chuck me a hog!
- Morning!
- Morning.
- Off to see the groundhog?
- I am.
Think it'll be an early spring?
I'm predicting March 21 st.
Good guess!
I think that actually is the first day of spring.
- Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
- I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.
Like some coffee?
Is there any possibility of getting an espresso or cappuccino?
I really don't know...
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.
I hope you enjoy the festivities.
- I'm sure I will.
- There's talk of a blizzard.
We may catch a break and it will blow right by.
The moisture coming out of the south...
...by midday will push on to the east.
At high altitudes it'll crystallize and give us what we call snow.
Our high will get to about 30 today, teens tonight.
Chance of precipitation, about 20% today, 20% tomorrow.
Did you want to talk about the weather or just chitchat?
Chitchat.
See you later.
Will you be checking out today?
Chance of departure today, 100%.
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.
Not a chance.
Ned!
Ryerson!
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.
Come on, buddy.
Case Western High!
I did the whistling bellybutton trick at the talent show.
Bing! Got the shingles real bad senior year. Almost didn't graduate.
Bing again!
I dated your sister a couple times till you told me not to anymore.
Well?
Ned Ryerson?
Bing!
Bing.
Did you turn pro with that bellybutton thing?
I sell insurance.
- What a shock.
- Do you have insurance?
If you do, you could always use more.
Am I right or am I right or am I right?
I would love to stand here and talk with you.
But I'm not going to.
See you.
That's all right!
I'll walk with you.
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.
Ned the Bull, that's me now.
I got friends who live and die by the actuarial tables.
I say it's all one big crapshoot anyhoo.
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.
Oh, God!
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?
Something else.
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!
Phil!
Phil, over here!
Where have you been?
It was horrible.
A giant leech got me.
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great!
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.
Then they go sit by the fire and get warm.
Then they come back and sing some more!
They're hicks, Rita.
So, did you sleep okay without me?
You tossed and turned, didn't you?
You're incredible.
Who told you?
It's groundhog time.
Okay.
On me in three...
...two, one.
Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn to this tiny hamlet...
...to watch a master at work.
The master?
Punxsutawney Phil...
...the world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.
Who, as legend has it, can predict an early spring.
The question we have to ask ourselves is:
" Does Phil feel lucky?"
Every year, the guy comes with a big stick and raps on the door.
They pull the little rat out, talk to him.
The rat talks back.
Then they tell us when it'll end.
Isn't he cute?
Do you like the guys with the prominent upper teeth?
This February 2nd, at 7:20 and 30 seconds...
...Punxsutawney Phil...
...the seer of seers...
...prognosticator of prognosticators...
...emerged reluctantly...
...but alertly...
...in Punxsutawney, PA...
...and stated in groundhog-ese...
..." I definitely see a shadow."
Sorry, folks.
Six more weeks of winter.
On me in three, two, one.
This is one time where television fails...
...to capture the excitement of a large squirrel...
...predicting the weather.
I'm grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...
...this is Phil Connors.
So long.
Want to try it again without the sarcasm?
We got it.
I'm out of here.
Prima donnas.
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.
What is going on?
I don't know. Perhaps that blizzard we're not supposed to get.
This is impossible.
Nobody honks this horn but me, okay, pal?
Take it out of here.
Commander, what's going on?
Nothing.
We're closing the road.
- Big blizzard moving in.
- It's a couple of flakes.
Don't you listen to the weather?
I make the weather.
All this moisture from the Gulf will push off to the east in Altoona.
You got that moisture on your head.
You can go back to Punxsutawney...
...or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.
So, what's it going to be?
I'm thinking.
Come on, all the long-distance lines are down?
What about the satellite?
Is it snowing in space?
Don't you keep a line open for emergencies or celebrities?
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.
Can you patch me through on that line?
Could I have one more of these with some booze in it?
I like it here.
Going to the groundhog dinner?
No, I had groundhog for lunch.
Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.
You two run along.
Looking foxy tonight, man.
Is your troop selling cookies again this year?
That's so funny.
So, what are you doing?
I think I'll go back to my room...
...take a hot shower and maybe read Hustler.
Suit yourself.
Yo, mom.
Isn't there any hot water?
Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.
Of course not.
Silly me.
Sweet dreams.
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.
- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day!
- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.
- with that blizzard thing.
That blizzard thing?
Here's the report.
The National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing.
There's another reason today's especially ex citing...
Especially cold.
The big question on everybody's lips...
- Chapped lips.
- Their chapped lips.
Will Phil come out and see his shadow?
- Punxsutawney Phil!
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers!
It's Groundhog Day!
Get up and chuck me a hog!
What the hell?
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?
Think it'll be an early spring?
Didn't we do this yesterday?
I don't know what you mean.
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!
- What day is this?
- It's February 2nd.
Groundhog Day.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
Did I sleep well?
Like some coffee?
Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.
I hope you enjoy the festivities.
There's talk of a blizzard.
Ever have dÃ©jÃ¡ vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?
I'll check with the kitchen.
That's okay.
Thank you.
Will you be checking out today?
I'd say the chance of departure is 80 percent.
75 to 80.
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?
To Gobbler's Knob.
It's Groundhog Day.
It's still just once a year, isn't it?
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!
My, oh my, Phil Connors!
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.
- Well?
- Ned Ryerson?
Bing! First shot right out of the box!
So how's it going, old buddy?
I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?
It's funny you should mention your health. Guess what I do now.
Do you sell insurance?
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!
Do you have life insurance?
If you do, you could always use more.
Right! I mean, who couldn't?
But you want to know something?
I gots a feeling...
...you ain't got any.
Am I right or am I right or am I right?
I got to go.
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!
Phil! Over here!
- Where have you been?
- Rita. Do me a favour.
I need someone to give me a good, hard slap in the face.
How's that?
Good!
If you need help with the other cheek,
I'm right here.
Something's going on.
- Are you drunk or something?
- Drunk's more fun.
Can I be serious with you for a minute?
Can you?
I'm being serious!
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.
It's groundhog time.
See? I knew you'd say that!
I really feel...
...weird.
Let's just do this.
Then we'll talk.
All right, on me in three...
...two, one.
Well, it's Groundhog Day...
...again...
...and that must mean we're up here at Gobbler's Knob...
...waiting for the world's most famous groundhog weatherman...
...Punxsutawney Phil...
...who's gonna tell us how much more winter to expect.
This is a riot!
Isn't he cute?
This February 2nd, at 7:20 and 30 seconds...
...Punxsutawney Phil, the seer of seers...
...prognosticator of prognosticators...
...emerged reluctantly...
...but alertly in Punxsu...
Oh, my gosh!
I know there's a blizzard.
When will the long-distance lines be repaired?
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?
Did you sleep well, Mr...
Phil Connors! I thought...
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!
Phil! Over here!
Can I talk to you?
It's not work-related.
- You never talk about work.
- We have to talk.
- It's a creative meeting.
- We've got work to do!
I don't.
I've already done it twice.
When you get finished, meet me in the diner.
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.
Prima donnas.
More coffee?
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.
Aren't they?
Just put that anywhere, pal!
Good save!
Tell me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.
I'm reliving the same day over and over.
Groundhog Day. Today.
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.
Really! This is the third time!
It's like yesterday never happened!
I'm racking my brain trying to imagine why you'd make this up.
I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for help!
What do you want me to do?
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.
You should get your head examined...
...if you expect me to believe a stupid story like that!
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.
Look out for your shadow, pal!
Morons, your bus is leaving!
You guys ready? We better go, to stay ahead of the weather.
- Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.
- I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard!
You said it was going to hit Altoona.
I know that's what I said.
I think you need help.
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.
No spots.
No clots, no tumours.
No lesions.
No aneurysms.
At least none that I can see.
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI, you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.
I can't go into Pittsburgh.
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- I told you, there's a blizzard.
Right. The blizzard!
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?
A biopsy.
A psychiatrist.
That's an unusual problem...
...Mr. Connors.
Most of my work is with couples, families. I have an alcoholic now.
You went to college, right?
It wasn't veterinary psychology, was it?
Didn't you take a course that covered this stuff?
Sort of, I guess.
Abnormal psychology.
So...
...what do I do?
We should meet again.
How's tomorrow for you?
Is that not good?
I was in the Virgin Islands once.
I met a girl.
We ate lobster.
Drank piÃ±a coladas.
At sunset, we made love like sea otters.
That was a pretty good day.
Why couldn't I get that day...
...over...
...and over and over?
Some guys would look at this glass and say:
"That glass is half empty."
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."
I peg you as a "glass is half empty" kind of guy. Right?
What would you do if you were stuck in one place...
...and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did mattered?
That about sums it up for me.
Good luck.
I'll drop you off.
This thing sticks a little bit.
You got to jiggle it...
Come on up here, pal.
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.
Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?
You're all right.
You want to throw up here or in the car?
I think, both.
I don't think I should drive.
I don't either.
Watch your head.
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.
Let's not forget seat belts.
Who else could go for some flapjacks right now?
Let me ask you a question.
Shoot.
What if there were no tomorrow?
No tomorrow? That means there'd be no consequences...
...no hangovers.
We could do whatever we wanted!
That's true.
We could do whatever we want.
If we wanted to hit mailboxes, we could let Ralph drive!
They want you to stop.
Hang on!
It's the same thing your whole life.
" Clean up your room! Stand up straight! Pick up your feet!
Take it like a man!
Be nice to your sister!
Don't mix beer and wine, ever!
Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"
That's one I agree with.
I don't know, Gus.
Sometimes I think you just have to...
...take the big chances.
This is the police! Pull over now!
We're talking in here!
I bet he swerves first.
I'm not going to live by their rules anymore!
I noticed that.
You make choices and you live with them.
My knee!
Let me handle this.
Three cheeseburgers, two large fries...
...two chocolate shakes and one large Coke.
And some flapjacks!
Too early for flapjacks?
Yes!
Rise and shine, campers!
Don't forget your booties!
It's cold out there today!
It's cold every day.
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!
Slept like a baby.
I'd love some of your coffee.
- I hope...
- Flurries moving in later...
...but the blizzard's going to hit outside of town.
Mrs. Lancaster?
Was anybody looking for me here this morning?
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?
No, no one like that!
Will there be?
Apparently not.
Will you hold my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.
Catch you tomorrow, pops.
- Phil Connors!
- Ned?
I like to see a man of advancing years throw caution to the wind.
It's inspiring, in a way.
My years are not advancing as fast as you think.
More coffee?
Keep it coming.
Sure thing.
Just put that anywhere, pal!
Good save!
Don't you worry about cholesterol, lung cancer, love handles?
I don't worry anymore.
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.
That's exactly what makes me so special.
I don't even have to floss.
What?
The wretch, concentred all in self
Living, shall forfeit fair renown
And doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung
Unwept...
... unhonoured and unsung
Sir Walter Scott.
You don't like poetry?
I love poetry!
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.
You think I act like this because I'm egocentric?
You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.
You guys ready? We better go, to stay ahead of the weather.
Thanks, Larry.
Would you like a doggie bag?
I'll stay and finish.
I thought you hated this town.
It's beginning to grow on me.
Larry, quit staring.
- These are excellent.
- Bon appÃ©tit.
You see the groundhog this morning?
I never miss it.
What's your name?
Nancy Taylor. And you are?
- What high school did you go to?
- What?
High school.
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?
Are you kidding?
In 12th grade, your English teacher was...
Mrs. Walsh.
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.
Thanks very much.
Nancy?
Nancy Taylor!
Lincoln High School!
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Connors!
- That's amazing!
- You don't remember me?
I asked you to the prom.
Phil Connors?
I was short and I've sprouted.
How are you?
Great.
You look terrific!
You look very, very terrific!
Listen, I got to go do this report.
Are you a reporter?
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.
I should have known! That's great!
But maybe later we could...
Yeah, whatever!
Stay right here.
Promise me?
I'll be right back. Wish me luck!
Good luck!
Oh, Phil.
Oh, Rita.
Who's Rita?
How should I know?
What is this, some kind of one-night stand?
On the contrary, Nancy...
...I love you.
I've always loved you.
This is going to seem sudden but...
...Nancy, will you be my wife?
Rita.
- Nancy.
- Whatever.
A gust of wind.
A dog barks.
Cue the truck.
Exit Herman.
Walk on to the bank.
Exit Felix, and stand there with a not-so-bright look on your face.
All right, Doris. Come on.
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.
Felix!
How you doing, Doris?
Can I have a roll of quarters?
Ten... nine... eight...
...car...
...six... five...
...quarters...
...three... two...
Felix?
- Did I bring out two bags or one?
- I don't know.
I thought we were going to a costume party.
It's like I said, I love this film.
I've seen it over 100 times.
Phil!
Told you...
...call me " Bronco."
Sorry, Bronco.
Hi, Nancy.
My own fiancÃ©e...
...doesn't remember me.
That'll be one adult and...
- Two adults.
- Two adults, I guess.
- groundhog who, as legend has it, can predict an early spring.
The question we have to ask ourselves today is:
"Does Phil feel lucky?"
Rita, if you only had one day to live...
...what would you do?
I don't know.
What are you dying of?
No, the whole world is about to explode.
What do you do?
I want to know where to put the camera.
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?
No, I'm just interested in you.
What do you want?
What do you like?
What do you think about?
What kind of men are you interested in?
What do you do for fun?
Are you trying to make me look like a fool?
I'm trying to talk like normal people.
Isn't this how they talk?
- Close.
- Okay, so talk to me.
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
And a doughnut.
All right.
So what do you want out of life?
I guess I want what everybody wants.
Career, love, marriage, children.
Are you seeing anyone?
This is getting too personal.
I'm not ready to share this with you.
How about you?
What do you want?
What I really want is someone like you.
Oh, please!
Why not? What are you looking for?
Who's your perfect guy?
First of all, he's too humble to know he's perfect.
That's me!
He's intelligent, supportive, funny...
Intelligent, supportive, funny.
Me, me, me.
He's romantic and courageous.
Me also.
He's got a good body but doesn't have to look in the mirror often.
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.
He's not afraid to cry.
This is a man we're talking about, right?
He likes animals, children, and he'll change poopy diapers.
Does he have to use the word " poopy"?
He plays an instrument, and he loves his mother.
I am really close on this one.
Really, really close.
It's Phil Connors!
Hello.
Thanks for watching.
What are the chances of getting out today?
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.
Wouldn't you know it?
Can I buy you a drink?
Jim Beam, ice, water.
For you, miss?
Sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist, please.
What are the chances of getting out today?
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.
Wouldn't you know it?
Can I buy you a drink?
Sweet vermouth, rocks, with a twist, please.
For you, miss?
The same.
That's my favourite drink.
Mine too!
It makes me think of Rome.
The way the sun hits the buildings in the afternoon.
What should we drink to?
To the groundhog!
I always drink to world peace.

The same.
That's my favourite drink.
Mine too!
It makes me think of Rome.
The way the sun hits the buildings in the afternoon.
What should we drink to?
I'd like to say a prayer and drink to world peace.
To world peace.
- This is wonderful!
- See? Didn't I tell you?
How do you know so much about Punxsutawney?
I spent a lot of time here.
Small-town people are more real, down-to-earth.
- That's how I feel!
- Really?
- Some white chocolate?
- Yuck, don't make me sick.
No white chocolate.
There is something so familiar about this.
Do you ever have dÃ©jÃ¡ vu?
Didn't you just ask me that?
People place too much emphasis on their careers.
I wish we could all live in the mountains.
That's where I see myself in five years. How about you?
I agree. I just like to go with the flow.
See where it leads me.
Well, it's led you here.
It's about a million miles from where I started in college.
You weren't in broadcasting or journalism?
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.
What a waste of time!
I mean, for someone else that'd be a total waste.
So bold of you to choose that.
It's incredible.
You must be a very strong person.
People place too much emphasis on their careers.
I wish we could all live in the mountains.
That's where I see myself in five years.
How about you?
I agree. I like to go with the flow, see what happens.
Well, it's gotten you here.
It's a million miles from where I started in college.
You weren't in broadcasting or journalism or anything like that?
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.
You speak French!
I haven't done this since I was a kid.
Me neither. It's fun!
Clean fun.
I hope one day I can do this with my own children.
Where'd you get that?
Well, I went over to the snowman shop.
Hey, an assassin!
I'll protect you!
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!
Find cover!
I'm getting some good ones.
That's a boy! Good try.
Help me!
What?
I'm just amazed, and I'm not easily amazed.
About what?
How you can start a day with one kind of expectation...
...and end up so completely different.
Do you like the way this day is turning out?
I like it very much.
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.
Well, you can.
It just takes an awful lot of work.
Come in.
I want to show you something.
- I don't think I should.
- I agree.
That's why I'll show you one thing, then kick you right out.
It's just lovely.
Would you like to sit and stare at the fake fire?
It's a really wonderful room.
It is now.
I don't think we should do this.
I don't either.
On second thought,
I think we should.
It's the perfect end to a perfect day.
Well, it's a little fast for me.
Me too.
Maybe I should go.
Where would you go?
Why?
We've got a perfect fire.
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire...
I will read to you.
I've got some ice cream on the windowsill. Hold on a minute.
Rocky road.
I love rocky road.
Yeah, I thought so.
You have to stay.
No, really, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.
No, Phil, really.
Just stay for a while and if you like it, stay longer.
And if you like that, stay longer.
Let's not spoil it, okay?
I don't want to spoil it either.
You know I can't stay with you.
Why not? I love you.
You love me?
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.
Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!
This whole day has been one long setup.
No, it hasn't.
And I hate fudge. Yuck!
No white chocolate, no fudge.
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?
Did you call my friends and ask them what I like?
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.
Stop saying that!
You must be crazy.
I could never love you because you'll never love anyone but yourself.
I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.
That's for making me care about you.
I haven't done this since I was a kid.
It's fun!
And good, clean fun too.
That's what's missing in the world.
I can't wait to do this with my own children.
I want lots of kids!
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.
I got this at Snowman City.
Hey! Some kid just threw a snowball at us.
Come here! Let's have some fun!
I wish these were my own kids.
Are any of you up for adoption?
Here's a humdinger over here!
Wasn't that great?
Stop it!
Phil! Over here!
Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.
Phil, you look terrible.
What happened? Rough night?
Okay, campers.
Rise and shine.
Don't forget your booties, because it's cold out there.
It's cold out there every day.
This country's largest lake,
Chapala, is located near Guadalajara.
What is Mexico?
What is Mexico?
- Correct.
- Lakes and Rivers, 400.
Seneca is the largest of these lakes.
What are the Finger Lakes?
- What are the Finger Lakes?
- Correct.
- This lake in Bolivia...
- What is Titicaca?
- What is Titicaca?
- Correct.
For 1000.
- Milky-coloured...
- The Rhone.
... when entering Lake Geneva...
... this river is clear blue upon exiting.
- Jim?
- The Rhone.
Good for $1000.
You're $500 off the lead right now.
This is pitiful.
A thousand people...
...freezing their butts off, waiting to worship a rat.
What a hype.
They used to pull the hog out, and they used to eat it.
You're hypocrites! All of you!
You got a problem, Larry?
Untie your tongue. Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you, princess?
You want a prediction about the weather?
You're asking the wrong Phil.
I'll give you a winter prediction.
It's going to be cold.
It's going to be gray.
And it's going to last you for the rest of your life.
Once again the eyes of the nation have turned here...
...to this tiny village in Western Pennsylvania.
There is no way that this winter...
...is ever going to end...
...as long as this groundhog keeps seeing his shadow.
I don't see any other way out.
He's got to be stopped.
And I have to stop it.
Real good, Phil.
Real good.
He's out of his gourd.
I'm worried. There's something really wrong with Phil.
There's a lot of things wrong with Phil.
Hi, Phil.
I've come to the end of me.
There's no way out now.
Just remember, we had a beautiful day together once.
All right, little fellow.
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?
I believe he did.
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.
Hi, there. Something I can do you for?
Hey! What are you doing?
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!
We are going after him!
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?
I could think of reasons.
Pervert.
He must have just snapped!
This ought to be good.
What is he doing?
What can he be thinking?
Not bad for a quadruped.
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.
That's it.
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.
Don't drive angry.
Don't drive angry.
There's no way out except the way we came in!
We got him now!
What is he doing?
I don't know.
If you got to shoot, don't hit the groundhog.
Mustn't keep them waiting.
It's showtime.
On me in three...
...two...
...one.
Phil!
He might be okay.
Well, no. Probably not now.
Nuts.
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
Would you like...
...some toast?
Oh, my God!
That's him.
He was a really, really great guy.
I really, really liked him...
...a lot.
I'm sorry?
What was that again?
- I'm a god.
- You're God?
I'm a god. I'm not the God,
I don't think.
Because you survived a car wreck?
You folks ready to order?
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up.
I have been stabbed, shot, poisoned...
...frozen, hung, electrocuted and burned.
Oh, really.
Every morning I wake up without a scratch, not a dent in the fender.
I am an immortal.
Special today is blueberry waffles.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to believe in me.
You are not a god.
Take my word. It's 12 years of Catholic school talking.
I can come back if you're not ready.
How do you know I'm not a god?
Please.
- How do you know?
- It's not possible.
I'll come back.
Doris.
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...
...before she dies.
Boy, would I!
- What are you doing?
- Debbie and her fiancÃ©.
Do I know you?
They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.
What?
Lovely ring.
Bill's been a waiter three years, since he left Penn State to work.
He likes the town, paints toy soldiers and he's gay.
I am.
Gus hates it here, wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.
I could've retired on half pay after 20 years.
Excuse me. Is this a trick?
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...
...he just knows everything.
- Who's that?
- Tom.
He worked in the coal mine till it closed.
- And her?
- Alice.
Came from Ireland when she was a baby. Lived in Erie.
He's right.
- And her?
- Nancy.
Works in a shop, makes noises like a chipmunk when she gets excited.
- It's true.
- How do you know this?
I told you, I know everything.
In five seconds, a waiter will drop a tray.
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.
- Okay?
- Okay, that's enough.
What about me?
Do you know me too?
I know all about you. You hope for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.
Well, everyone knows that.
You like boats but not the ocean.
You go to a lake in the summer with your family.
There's a dock and a boathouse with boards missing from the roof...
...and a place you used to crawl underneath to be alone.
You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.
You're very generous.
You're kind to strangers and children.
When you stand in the snow you look like an angel.
How are you doing this?
I told you. I wake up every day.
Right here.
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.
And there's nothing
I can do about it.
If you still can't believe me, listen:
In 10 seconds...
...Larry is going to come and take you away from me.
But you can't let him.
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.
You guys ready? We better go, to stay ahead of the weather.
What's that?
"... to stay ahead of the weather."
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.
Maybe I should spend the day with you...
...as an objective witness, just to see what happens.
This sounds like a science project.
Concentrate.
You got to want it.
You got to want it, Rita.
Come on. It's more in the wrist than the fingers.
Be the hat. Come on, go.
- It'd take me a year to get good.
- Six months.
Four to five hours a day, and you'd be an expert.
- Is this what you do with eternity?
- Now you know.
That's not the worst part.
What's the worst part?
The worst part is that...
...tomorrow you'll have forgotten all about this...
...and you'll treat me like a jerk again.
I am a jerk.
No, you're not.
It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times...
...I don't even exist anymore.
Sometimes I wish I had a thousand lifetimes.
I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.
It just depends on how you look at it.
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!
I want you to know it's been a really nice day for me.
Me too.
And maybe...
...if it's not too boring, we can do it again sometime.
I hope so.
You're still here?
I thought you were supposed to disappear. Or I was.
Not until 6.
You rat!
I never said midnight.
You knew I was waiting for midnight.
Are you going to leave?
No.
Good.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.
I promise I won't touch you.
Much.
It's all right. I'm not tired.
What were you saying?
I think the last thing that you heard was:
"Only God could make a tree."
Really?
What I wanted to say was...
...I think you are the kindest...
...sweetest, prettiest person...
...l've ever met in my life.
I've never seen anyone...
...that's nicer to people than you are.
And the first time I saw you...
...something happened to me.
I never told you...
...but I knew I wanted to hold you...
...as hard as I could.
I don't deserve someone like you.
But if I ever could...
...I swear I would love you...
...for the rest of my life.
Did you say something?
Good night, Rita.
Good night, Phil.
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.
- It's cold out there!
- It's cold every day.
- Is this Miami Beach?
- Not hardly!
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.
Thanks, Phil.
Larry?
Skim milk, two sugar.
Thanks, Phil.
Pastry?
We're setting up.
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.
I talked with Buster Green, the head groundhog honcho.
He said if we set up here we'll get a better shot.
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.
Larry?
Yeah. Let's go for it.
Good work, Phil.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.
We never talk.
Do you have kids?
I'd like a piano lesson.
I'm with a student. But if you want to come back tomorrow...
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1000.
Come on in.
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?
Buon giorno, signore!
Think it'll be an early spring?
Winter, slumbering in the open air
Wears on his smiling face...
... a dream of spring
Ciao!
Ciao!
How does she look?
Great.
Thank you.
- Did you know he could ice sculpt?
- No.
Not bad. You say this is your first lesson?
Yes, but my father was a piano mover, so...
- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
- Ned Ryerson.
I have missed you so much.
I don't know where you're headed, but can you call in sick?
I got to get going.
It's good to see you, Phil.
Hello, father.
Let's get you someplace warm.
Remember me?
You brought the old man in?
How is he?
He just passed away.
- What did he die of?
- He was just old.
It was just his time.
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!
You can't come in here.
Sir, this is a restricted area.
Where's the chart?
Sometimes people just die.
Not today.
Gets hard down there at the bottom.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come on, dad.
Come on, pop.
Come on. Come on, breathe.
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!
When Chekhov saw the long winter...
...he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope.
Yet we know winter is just another step in the cycle of life.
But standing here among the people of Punxsutawney...
...and basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts...
...I couldn't imagine a better fate...
...than a long and lustrous winter.
From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.
So long.
Nice speech. Very nice.
Thank you.
- How was that for you two?
- My man, you touched me.
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.
I got to go.
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.
I surprise myself sometimes.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.
Errands? What errands?
I thought we were going back.
What do you say?
What do you say?
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!
I'll see you tomorrow...
...maybe.
You totaled it.
- It's only a flat tire.
- What are we going to do?
- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake.
What is it?
Thank you, young man.
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.
Just be comfortable.
It'll be a minute.
Who is that?
He must be from the motor club.
He's having a heart attack!
Do something!
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer, doctor, anything!
I think that did it.
If you're going to eat steak, get sharper teeth.
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.
Who was that?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
Eat, eat!
People don't understand...
...what's involved.
This is an art form.
I think most people just think...
...that I hold a camera and point it at stuff.
There's a lot more to it than that.
Would you be interested in seeing the inside of a van?
You know, I really have to get back to the party.
Great idea.
I'll go with you.
Let me just drop a tip here.
Hi! How are you?
Rita, this is Nancy.
We were going to the party.
You going?
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.
I think he's already in there.
Isn't he good?
He's great!
He's my student.
I'm so proud.
Thank you.
Hello, welcome to our party.
I didn't know you could play like that.
I'm versatile.
It's that nice young man from the motor club.
Thank you again.
It's nothing, ladies.
He's the fastest jack in Jefferson County.
What was that all about?
Don't know. They've been hitting on me all night.
There you are!
I never thanked you properly for what you did.
He would've choked for sure.
He may have. He was trying to swallow a whole cow.
I owe you one, buddy.
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.
What did you do today?
Same old, same old.
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.
Fred, how was the wedding?
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.
All I did was fan her flame of passion for you.
You are the best.
No, you are.
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?
No way!
WrestleMania!
No way!
How'd you know?
We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway!
Thank you. You're a real pal.
Oh, this is the best.
I don't understand.
I guess not.
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.
You're the most popular person in town.
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?
I want to thank you for fixing Felix's back.
He can help around the house again.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Felix.
Dr. Connors?
It's kind of an honorary title.
What is going on?
I really don't know.
There is something going on with you.
You want the long or short version?
Let's start with the short and go from there.
Okay, folks, attention.
Time for the bachelor auction.
You know the rules.
All the eligible bachelors come in front.
And you ladies...
...you bid on them!
Do whatever you want with them...
...no questions asked!
I don't want to know about it, as long as it's legal.
Get out your pocketbooks, and remember it's all for charity.

Sold to the lady for 25 cents.

Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.
This is Ned Ryerson, my new insurance agent.
I'll say.
I haven't seen him for 20 years.
He comes up and buys whole life, term, fire, auto, dental, health...
...with the optional death and dismemberment plan.
This is the best day of my life.
- Mine too.
- Mine too.
Where are we going?
Let's not spoil it.
Let's not...
I got that.
Why can't I look?
Because you bother me a lot.
I'm getting cold.
How long do I have to sit here?
I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.
Well, I think you were a bargain.
Sweet of you to say.
You're right.
Is it finished yet?
I still have to put cherry syrup on the top...
...then we can eat it.
Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!
One second, one second.
Let me turn it in the light.
It's amazing.
It's beautiful.
How did you do that?
I know your face so well,
I could do it with my eyes closed.
It's lovely.
I don't know what to say.
I do.
No matter what happens tomorrow...
...or for the rest of my life...
...l'm happy now...
...because I love you.
I think I'm happy too.
Please. Not again.
- That's a great song.
- It's not.
Don't listen to this man...
It's too early.
Something is different.
Good or bad?
Anything different is good.
But this could be real good.
Why are you here?
I bought you.
I own you.
But why are you still here?
You said, "Stay," so I stayed.
I said, "Stay," so you stayed.
I can't even make a collie stay.
I got to check something.
Stay.
Stay.
They're gone!
They're all gone.
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what?
Today is tomorrow.
It happened.
- You're here.
- I'm here.
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.
It was the end of a very long day.
Is there anything I can do for you today?
I'm sure I can think of something.
It's so beautiful!
Let's live here.
We'll rent to start.

AtIantis ?
You're wasting your time here.
Every man in my Iegion is of nobIe bIood.
My bIood's red as any man's.
[ ChuckIing ]
Take heart, KuII. There's a pIace in this worId for aII of us.

- Even a barbarian Iike yourseIf.
- GeneraI TaIigaro !

GeneraI TaIigaro, the paIace is in chaos.

[ Men YeIIing, Indistinct ]
[ Horse Neighing ]
Hyah !
Hyah ! Hyah !
Faster ! Faster !
Whoa !
What have you done, Borna ?
My eIders chaIIenged me for the throne, so I've spared aII my chiIdren any future disappointment !
This is madness, sire.
TaIigaro, so you, too, wiII have my crown.
You want it.
Take it ! Here !
Take it !
There'II be no more bIood spiIIed tonight, except your own if you insist on it.
Treason !
[ Laughing ]
I spare your Iife tonight.
[ Grunting, Groaning ]
The crown, KuII.
Give it to me.
It's my birthright.
Succession faIIs to me. Give it to me.
[ Man ]
HoId !
I am next in Iine, cousin !
-[ FIesh Searing ] Ahh !
-Lords, points of Iaw must be cIarified.
- The crown is mine !
- [ King Borna ] No !
It's mine.
And I give it to--
I give it to you, KuII.
Here ! Take it.
And keep it if you can.
[ Laughing, Choking ]
The sacred Iaw of succession-- undeniabIe and irreversibIe.
- Long Iive the king.
- Long Iive the king.
Long Iive the king.
[ SoIdiers ]
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive KuII.
[ Whispering ]
Sire, you, you no Ionger need bow to anyone.
- My king.
- Sire.
Borna's harem,
Your Majesty.
[ Chattering ]
And now yours.
InduIge me, Tu.
Even a king shouId bow to the Iadies.
Down.
You stiII read the hands of fate.
You read them for me once.
''King by the hand of a king,'' remember ?
I'm surprised you remember, miIord.
You were very drunk.
SiIence !
You are insoIent.
[ ChuckIes ]
But honest.
Yes, I was drunk, though I do remember.
Borna had a fit because I grabbed you about the waist and tried to kiss you.
You did kiss me, and it wasn't my waist you grabbed.
[ ChuckIes ]
What is your name ?
Zareta.
Ah.
Bring your cards to my chambers, Zareta.
Leave us.
- ShaII I undress, sire ?
- No. ShuffIe.
UnfoId my kingdom's destiny in the cards.
First, the hand of the spirit.
- The tiger.
- That's my totem.
- I was caIIed ''the Tiger'' when I was a pirate.
- A sign of majesty and power.
Next, the hand of being.
A quest.
My whoIe Iife has been a quest.
The hand of destiny.
Destiny.
The kiss.
The fate of your kingdom wiII be found within a kiss.
A kiss ?
Is that so ?
ShaII I undress now ?
Are you in a hurry ?
I am whatever you wish.
My women don't pIay games.
I'm not your woman.
I'm your sIave.
[ Both Grunting ]
Tu was right.
You are insoIent.
- But honest.
- I do not take women against their wiII.
As Iong as they come to you on command and not by choice, how wiII you know ?
I'II do my best to satisfy you in the bedchamber now, but do not mistake compIiance for enthusiasm.
The destiny of a sIave is to submit.
Now, shaII I undress ?
I don't need to be taught a sIave's destiny.
I Iearned that Iesson chained to the oar of a pirate gaIIey.
For five Iong years,
I Iearned.
Tonight I sIeep aIone.
[ Door RattIes ]
Your Majesty.
Hear me now. AII sIaves of VaIusia shaII be set free, starting with my own.
You, go home.
I am home, Majesty.
I was born here in the paIace.
Oh. WeII, from now on, you wiII receive a fair wage.
You, where are you from ?
ZaIgara, Your Majesty.
You wish to go home ?
- WeII, do so now. You're free.
- KuII !
Free VaIusians have a right to own sIaves under the Iaw.
The Iaw is changed.
Sire, Iook, um, for thousands of years, this Iaw has been on this stone.
It was carved by our forefathers, and it may not be aItered.
No matter how crueI or unjust the Iaw ?
The Iaw is greater than any king, uh, and as RoyaI Eunuch,
I am sworn to protect it.
[ Groans ]
[ Cheering ]
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Freedom !
- [ Whip SIashing ]
- [ Man Shouting ]
Our days are numbered !
The force of the peopIe never rests.
Your time is short, too, Mandara.
Mandara.
Who is this man ?
AscaIante,
High Priest of VaIka.
He was trying to reopen his tempIe.
He was exiIed by King Borna for heresy.
No ! For speaking
VaIka's truth.
VaIka aIIows the unhoIy fIame to burn as a reminder of godIess times... and as an omen of things to come.
Nonsense !
- ReIease him.
- You can't !
Is there some ancient Iaw which prevents this too ?
If so, teII me now.
UntiI then, Iet men worship what gods they wiII.
- [ PeopIe Cheering ]
- Reopen your tempIe, priest.
[ Cheering Continues ]
- You're going too fast, KuII.
- Not fast enough.
Long Iive KuII !
- The staff goes in the other hand.
- Oh.
Long Iive KuII !
Long Iive KuII !
- Long Iive KuII !
- Members of the RoyaI Court, peopIe of VaIusia.
For centuries the Topaz Throne... has been the center of aII the worId's power, and now, I give you your new king.
Long Iive KuII !
Long Iive KuII !
Long Iive KuII !
[ Screaming ]
Enemy spies, Your Majesty, no doubt sent from Commoria.
No doubt.
You sent for me, sire ?
Yes. To say good-bye.
Good-bye ?
I wiII not command your affections, Zareta.
You're free to go.
We'II aII be damned.
I choose to stay.
Why ?
To be king is to be aIone.
Today's event made that cIear.
I am used to court intrigue, sire.
I can heIp you. I--
Is this the onIy reason you stay ?
Tonight, I sIeep aIone.
I do go too fast.
[ ThundercIap ]
Where is he ?
[ Horse Neighing ]
It's about time, TaIigaro.
Why have you summoned us to this eviI pIace ?
I didn't. I received a note marked with our sign.
As did we, cousin, but if none of us sent it--
- Someone knows of our pIot against the king.
- [ Man ] That's right.
And why it has faiIed.
Enaros.
I'd heard rumors of your ghost haunting the city.
I've had no need for the company of men.
But I see you stiII crave the fIame's embrace.
''Let men worship what gods they wiII.''
Isn't that what your new king said ?
- [ GrowIing ]
- Wizard, what do you want now ?
I've come to heIp with your pIot to kiII the barbarian king.
How ?
You can't sIay this tiger with mere weapons.
You have to trap him first.
[ Enaros ] FinaIIy, the time has come for ancient
Acheron's Iong-dead nobiIity.
[ Hissing ]
[ Grunting ]
Akivasha, the Red Witch.
There she is, the sorceress queen of ancient Zakerof.
Let's see.
The Ieft breast above her heart.
The scroII !
The scroII spoke true.
[ GrowIing, Grunting ]
- Akivasha's bIood.
- [ GrowIs ]
Kanah maya kaIunia gud gamesh.
Kanah maya kaIunia gud gamesh !
Return, O Queen !
Acheron's kiss-- kiss of the sacred fIame--
Iet it fire your souI.
Awake. Awake and rise.
And Iive !
Live ! And ruIe !
Ohh, Akivasha.
Akivasha ? Akivasha.
You are Akivasha. Remember ?
O Queen.
The sacred fIame of Acheron that's burned since your time.
- And my kingdom ?
- Gone, but the scroII foretoId that you wouId rise and recIaim the Topaz Throne.
And so you shaII, with my heIp.
And then, six days from that time, darkness wiII shroud the Earth... and Acheron wiII rise again.
- Who are you ?
- Enaros, your humbIe servant, who's devoted his Iife to your return.
[ Moans ]
The worId has much changed during your Iong sIeep.
Too Iong a sIeep.
[ TaIigaro ]
Good morning, king.
Today, you'II meet the finest peopIe in aII VaIusia.
Who knows ?
Perhaps you'II find your queen here.
- My queen ?
- Yes, yes.
You can have your choice. A proper marriage wouId appease the nobiIity.
I can have any woman I want ?
- [ ChuckIing ]
- Your Majesty.
Good morning, sire.
Uh, come. Take your pIace for the presentation.
You see, miIord, every nobIe has brought the prize of his house.
Fanara, from the House of BaIIin.
As pure as virgin snow.
- We've met. She's not that pure.
- Shh.
- My niece, eunuch.
- NaIissa, niece of DucaIon, came to pay homage, sire.
[ Akivasha's Voice Echoing ]
Come to me. Be my Iover. Queen.
The next girI, sire.
Sire, the next girI.
Take off your veiI.
- Let me see your face.
- Oh.
ProtocoI does not permit.
The king... makes protocoI.
[ Echoing ]
Make Iove to me now.
MiIord, the others.
There are no others.
[ Echoing ]
I am yours.
Mmm.
- My queen !
- [ Cheering ]
My Queen.
A toast to the king and queen.
May your wedding night
Iast Ionger than your courtship.
And may fate smiIe on you both.
WeII, Iet's see.
Zareta, come teII us our fate.
- Zareta.
- [ Cards Drop ]
- What are you doing here ?
- Borna is dead.
Haven't you heard ?
I've missed you.
You are mad to come back.
[ Sighs ]
Not Iong ago, I was just a pirate.
Today I am king, and I have one of the IoveIiest of nobIewomen.
Who'd have thought it ?
I thought it.
- ReaIIy ?
- It was in the cards.
Sit. Divine our future.
WiII you choose ?
Oh, why worry for tomorrow, when we know our destiny tonight ?
No !
- You mustn't !
- [ ChuckIes ] Ow.
[ PeopIe Gasping ]
Your pIaything is jeaIous, husband.
- It's nothing. It's--
- This is the destiny you chose: the death card.
Must I pubIicIy compete for your affection with a paIace whore ?
- Away.
- The cards do not Iie !
- You forget your pIace.
- No !
- Let go !
- [ PeopIe ] Ohhh !
- You okay ?
- It seems our priest here fancies you, Zareta.
Perhaps you'd Iike to go with this... admirer.
I wiII stay and serve the king.
Enough ! Tonight is my wedding night.
Everyone must share our joy.
[ Cheering ]
[ Akivasha Moaning, Gasping ]
[ Echoing ] Yes.
- Ahh.
- NaIissa.
Come. Kiss your bride.
[ Chokes ]
[ Screaming ]
He's dead !
He's dead !
[ Sobs ]
It wasn't the wine.
I had some.
But poison, yes. How ?
Who ?
The whore !
[ SoIdier ]
This way ! Inside !
[ Women Screaming ]
[ BIeating ]
You've done weII.
You've honored our pact, and when I am king, you wiII be richIy rewarded.
[ ChuckIes ]
[ GrowIs ]
Psst.
You Iike the fIame's embrace ?
You shouIdn't pIay with fire, Enaros.
It hoIds so many painfuI memories.
[ Screaming ]
Oh, my hand ! My hand !
- [ ChuckIes ]
- Restore it !
Make it whoIe again !
No ! It wiII remind you who is master.
What are you, witch ?
I am queen... thanks to you.
What do you want ?
I want you, husband.
I was going to kiII you, but after Iast night--
Join me.
I wiII make you immortaI, and the Earth shaII be our empire.
[ Echoing ]
You are mine.
I wouId rather die.
[ Screams ]
So be it.
Do it ! SIowIy.
By the grace of VaIka, I wiII send you back to the darkest pit of heII !
Don't waste your prayers, dog.
Soon heII wiII be coming to us.
You are ugIy.
Your Majesty !
I suspected fouI doings.
I rejoice to find you aIive.
Of course I'm aIive.
I've escaped grimmer dungeons than that.
AII of VaIusia beIieves you've been murdered.
Zareta is to be executed for the crime.
When I get my hands on the bitch demon,
I wiII rip out her eviI heart.
She won't be so easy to kiII.
This mark burns on her breast.
What is it ?
The coin of ancient Acheron.
Your queen was once queen of that eviI empire... when the worId was cIoaked in darkness and demons ruIed over men.
The Red Witch ?
Your bride is over
3,000 years oId.
- She said she was 19.
- She is Akivasha reborn.
From the Topaz Throne she wiII bring back ancient Acheron... and open the gates of heII.
''The fate of your kingdom wiII be found within a kiss.''
Comfy ?
FIeas.
HaIt ! HoId.
HoId it there.
A guard, Your Majesty.
Get away from there !
Come on. Move.
[ Sighing ]
- Go. Outta my way.
- Excuse me.
[ Groaning ]
[ Man ] You kiIIed the king.
You must die !
[ Crowd Booing ]
Let's go.
[ PeopIe YeIIing, Booing ]
[ Sniffing ]
Something stinks.
WeII, it's not me.
It's me.
[ Horn BIowing ]
[ Horn Continues ]
[ Tu ]
Ach, the stench !
I think the body's gone ripe.
It's a good thing we're burning it.
A bit more IiberaI with that incense.
May this dog suffer an eternity of pain.
- But not today !
- [ Crowd Screams ]
Stop him !
HopeIess.
Watch out !
- Head for the tempIe !
- This way ! This way !
Let's go ! Hurry !
Who is it ?
Who eIse ?
[ Laughs ]
You desire him.
- My passion burns, sIave.
- [ Screaming ]
CIose the gate !
[ KuII ]
Faster ! Get inside.
Hurry !
[ Indistinct YeIIing ]
Go, go, go !
- Out of my way.
- Don't Iet him out !
- [ Screaming ]
- [ KuII ] Keep going !
Not good.
[ Grunts ]
Damn !
Oh, shit !
[ YeIIing ]
Oof ! Ohh.
- The passage !
- Stop ! In the queen's name,
Iay down your arms.
In the king's name,
Iay down yours.
KuII Iives.
[ SoIdier Muttering ]
Your Majesty ! Sire !
Your Highness.
Get up ! I say to you,
KuII is dead.
And never again wiII a foreigner suIIy our throne. Impostor !
Traitor !
On your feet.
[ YeIIs ]
Go !
AscaIante !
- What are you doing ?
- I can't take a man's Iife.
- Now you teII me ?
- [ YeIIing ]
Put that down ! Go !
Go ! Go !
- Are you aII right ?
- I'm okay.
Hey ! Just who is this priest to you ?
My brother.
Brother ?
Her brother ? Good.
- Hyah ! Hyah !
- Hyah ! Hyah !
Are you deceitfuI or just cIumsy ?
You betrayed me.
He's not here.
You said he was dead !
Remember your pIace !
My pIace is on the throne.
What game is this you're pIaying ?
The dog knows a few tricks, that's aII.
Find him, kiII him, and then we'II ruIe together.
No. That was not part of our pact.
I have aItered our pact.
Pray I do not aIter it further.
Move out !
First we deaI with KuII.
Then we'II see her festering in her grave where she beIongs.
[ AscaIante ]
The port of TatheIi.
From here we must saiI north, find the IsIe of Ice and bring back the breath of VaIka.
The breath of VaIka is just a myth.
For centuries men have searched for it, but no man has ever found it.
- It doesn't exist.
- It does exist.
OnIy VaIka's breath can extinguish the fIame which fIows in Akivasha's veins.
If you faiI,
VaIusia is doomed.
Whoa.
- Stay here.
- [ Both ] Where are you going ?
To see an oId friend.
[ Men HaggIing ]
Excuse my partner.
H-He doesn't know what he is saying.
AII right. Yeah.
It's good.
Hey ! KuII ! KuII !
- They toId me you were dead.
- Uh, they tried.
But here I am, drinking your wine.
It's good wine too.
Oh, KuII, you haven't changed at aII, my friend.
Come, you buIging bag of muscIe and hair.
Come. TaIk to me.
Pucci, cocktaiIs.
It's good to see you, Juba.
Look at this pIace.
It's, uh, not Iike the oId days.
WeII, I've gotten rich off pirates Iike you.
You know what they say:
You can never have too much money... or too many good friends.
[ ChuckIes ]
I don't see any friends.
So, come on, KuII.
We're back in business, right ?
[ Sighs ]
I need a favor.
What do you want, a woman ?
Pucci !
- No.
- What, two women ?
- Ten women ?
- No women.
No women ? KuII !
Have you got a probIem ?
Juba.
I need a ship.
WeII, here she is, my fastest ship.
Take her, my friend.
She's yours.
Why don't you come with us ?
Oh, KuII, you know
I hate the smeII of fish.
I insist.
We have a Iot of catching up to do.
Captain.
SaiI north.
Wake up, scum !
Prepare to row !
The wind is up.
UnfurI the saiIs.
Do it.
Ship the oars !
Don saiIs !
[ Knocking ]
He saiIed from TatheIi, headed due north.
He seeks the IsIe of Ice.
He seeks the breath of VaIka.
No man has ever found it.
KuII is no ordinary man.
TaIigaro, you must stop him.
With my heIp, you can defeat him.
Now, first, you must prepare a ship.
Where do I saiI ?
Leave that to me.
Obey and you wiII share in gIories far beyond your earthIy ambitions.
- Yes ?
- Power, immortaIity.
Do my bidding.
Share my throne.
Yes, my Queen.
Bitch.
The breath of VaIka ! FooI.
The worId couId have been yours, KuII.
I couId have been yours.
[ Akivasha ]
BIow, winds of heIIfire !
BIow ! Send my swift destruction across the sea.
Oh !
[ Gagging ]
[ Laughing ]
Can I do anything for you ?
I'm fine.
Don't Iove where there's no hope, sister.
Food.
[ Grunts ] You ?
Come, my precious fIower.
You'II feeI better if you have something to eat.
You Iike fish eye ?
No fish eye.
Okay, bring on the meat.
Forget the hors d'oeuvres.
Come eat, my friends. Eat.
There's aIways pIenty to eat at Juba's.
Come and feast, my friends.
Forgive me, sire.
Where are my manners ?
Eating before the king.
Where are your brains ?
Eating before Juba.
What ? WeII, you think--
Oh, KuII, you're breakin' my heart.
You think I'd poison you ?
[ ChuckIing ]
Of course not.
- See, it's not deadIy.
It's just a IittIe dry.
- WeII, then, some wine to wash it down.
- AbsoIuteIy. To your heaIth.
- No, no, no.
To yours. Drink up.
[ Groaning ]
Come, my friends.
Don't be siIIy.
Eat, drink, fiII yourseIves.
Oh, KuII.
Things... have just not been the same... since you and I--
[ Groans ]
[ Groaning ]
It's okay, Zareta.
You'II get your sea Iegs in a day or two.
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Grunts ]
[ Juba ]
Hey ! Hey.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Ahh. FinaIIy awake.
Ohh.
[ Laughing ]
Oh. You got nice equipment.
Think I'II get a nice price for that.
WeII, you certainIy did make a pig of yourseIf Iast night.
By the way, the food was not poisoned. It was drugged.
Oh, your queen's gonna be happy to see you when we dock in VaIusia.
I think you're gonna make me a nice profit.
MeanwhiIe, you can earn your keep here at the oars.
I'm sure you can pick it up again in no time.
- What have you done with Zareta ?
- Oh, her.
Bring the fine young Iady.
Come. Bring her.
[ Muttering ]
- Yes, bring her.
Bring her, bring her, bring her.
- Let go of me.
Maybe I couId, uh, seII her too.
You know, I think she cIeans up very niceIy.
You dog !
Why, you--
You are not fit to wear a fine Iady's things.
DangIe her in the drink.
[ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
I'II kiII you.
I don't think so.
- Those ropes are strong.
- [ YeIIing ]
- Mmm.
- Pity your ship isn't.
Where's that sword ?
Where's that sword ?
[ YeIIing ]
KuII. KuII, come on. It's me.
No, I was jokin'. It was a joke.
Come on. Oh, boy, you shouId've seen your face.
You shouId see yours.
Ohh.
KuII !
PuII out the knife.
PuII it !
KuII ! I can't swim !
- I can't swim !
- Zareta !
Don't go anywhere !
Hang on !
- [ Crack ]
- [ Screaming ]
[ AII ]
Down here ! Down here !
Come on !
[ MetaI CIanging ]
[ Neck Cracking ]
Not bad, priest. No !
Zareta !
[ Groaning ]
- Where the heII have you been ?
- Busy.
Give me your hand.
Thuron ! Run our course.
SaiI north.
Aye, Tiger.
[ Laughing ]
Hey, KuII !
You can come back now !
- KuII !
- [ Men Screaming ]
## [ Fanfare ]
[ Crowd Murmuring ]
Citizens of VaIusia, rest assured that we wiII find the whore who murdered our beIoved king... and the impostor that keeps her from justice.
We wiII have their bIood !
[ Cheering ]
And know this:
KuII's Iegacy wiII not die.
I wiII Iead VaIusia into the future, and our kingdom shaII reign supreme !
[ Cheering ]
What's wrong ?
[ Enaros ] You squander your affections on unworthy men, when the one who brought you back from the dead... remains your devoted servant.
Enaros.
You forget your pIace.
[ Shuddering ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Screaming ]
The IsIe of Ice.
[ KuII ] The wind is up !
Raise the saiI !
- Man the oars !
- Man the oars !
[ Boatswain ]
Keep rowing !
She shouId be in regaI robes, not bearskins.
She wasn't born a sIave,
Your Majesty.
Borna sentenced me to death for heresy, but Zareta begged him for mercy.
She traded her virtue and freedom for my Iife.
[ KuII ]
Put some more torches on the deck !
[ Shouting, Indistinct ]
Keep your eyes open !
- [ Shivering ]
- Soon.
- [ Crashing ]
- [ YeIIing ]
- [ Wood SpIintering ]
AscaIante !
[ Men Groaning ]
Steer away !
[ KuII ]
The ships that never returned !
Give me your hand !
There ! The cave !
- AscaIante !
- I'm aII right.
VaIka !
KuII ! Look !
''What was faIse must be true.
Cause be the carrier of VaIka's might... to defy unhoIy fIame.''
What does it mean ?
AscaIante.
The praying maiden.
''Cause be the carrier.''
- Zareta !
- Zareta !
AscaIante ! Wait !
''Cause be the carrier.''
Akivasha was the cause !
A woman !
OnIy a woman wiII bring forth the breath of VaIka !
Tiger ! Tiger ! Tiger !
- [ Screaming ]
- KuII !
I kneeI before you, VaIka, to pray for your son KuII, whom I Iove, and though I am not pure, my Iove is strong.
Come, barbarian !
I'm yours.
[ Screaming ]
I see you've yet to master a nobIeman's bIade.
[ Groaning ]
[ Zareta ] Let me be the carrier of your might !
Let me extinguish the fIame that mocks your rage !
[ Gasping ]
Zareta !
Zareta, speak to me.
It is inside of her.
The breath of VaIka.
So... so coId.
Zareta. Zareta must stand in the fIame of Acheron.
That is how Akivasha wiII be vanquished.
You can't have her.
Hah !
[ Groaning ]
[ Fierce YeII ]
Huh ?
AscaIante !
Finish what you started, priest.
- [ Groaning ]
- No !
- [ Grunting ]
- No !
You can't win.
You aIready Iost !
Everyone and everything you hoId dear is doomed because of you-- an arrogant dog who wouId be king !
Come here !
Zareta !
KuII !
[ Gasping ]
[ Groans ]
AscaIante !
KuII, if Zareta dies, the breath of VaIka wiII be Iost forever, and VaIusia wiII become a Iiving heII.
She Ioves you very much.
Such Iove was wasted on a fooI !
I was bIinded by pride and greedy dreams of nobiIity, and now a kingdom wiII pay the price.
Let me Iook at you.
CoId to the touch.
Ah.
The fIame dies.
Ah, yes, the priest was right.
You wiII stand in the unhoIy fire untiI it burns no more.
- Take her away.
- Sir.
Now, I wiII destroy the Iying witch... and take my rightfuI pIace as king.
After aII we've done in VaIka's name, Iook.
Your god Iaughs at us.
[ Fierce YeII ]
[ YeIIing ]
Forgive me, VaIka.
[ YeIIing ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Banging, Door Bursting Open ]
- DucaIon.
- Your Majesty, your procIamation has caused unrest among the nobIes.
The nobIes ?
Did you reaIIy think I'd step down ?
Hmm ?
- What is this ?
- The future.
AII I wanted was to be king !
It was my right !
- Hmm.
- What did you dredge up out of heII ?
I have bartered my souI, and VaIusia is Iost.
Yes, and Acheron wiII be Acheron again.
The past wiII be restored.
I shaII make you the past.
Witch !
Hmm.
Enaros, heIp me.
- HeIp me !
- Not me, fooI.
[ Hissing ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Crowd CIamoring ]
- [ ExcIaiming ]
- [ Man ] What's happening ?
It is done, my Queen.
[ Moaning ]
- Mistress.
- It is time.
[ Gasps ]
KuII ?
KuII !
- ImpossibIe !
- No. Stop him ! KiII him !
Or suffer my wrath !
Sacred fIame, protect us from the coId !
Hurry, Mistress.
Cause be the carrier.
The Topaz Throne is mine, witch !
I take what is my due, and now I give you yours.
[ Shrieking ]
[ Screaming, Gasping ]
- The fIame does not die.
- No !
The fIame does not die !
[ CackIing ]
No, VaIka.
She must not die.
She must not die !
You're stiII a barbarian, KuII.
[ Groaning ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Demonic Voice ]
KuII !
You have faiIed, KuII !
You have aII faiIed !
The breath of VaIka has died with her, and in moments,
I wiII be invincibIe !
[ Roaring ]
[ Laughing ]
KuII !
A kiss. A kiss.
[ Shrieking ]
Husband.
[ Low GrowI ]
Husband.
Come kiss your bride.
Yes. A kiss.
[ Roaring ]
Husband.
You're so coId.
CoId !
[ Screaming ]
The fate of my kingdom wiII be found within a kiss !
[ Shrieks ]
- [ Groaning ]
- Back !
Her Iife for the crown !
Hey, hey, hey !
The crown !
[ Fierce YeII ]
[ Groaning ]
That's how a barbarian fights !
[ Crowd Cheering ]
Give me that.
[ GiggIing ]
PeopIe of VaIusia, now I give you your new king !
- [ Crowd ] HaiI !
- M-MiIord, miIord.
Sire ? Uh, sire, sire.
Uh, uh, uh, sire ?
AII sIaves of VaIusia are now free.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Oh ! No, no, no !
But the Iaws ! Oh !
The Iaws ! The Iaws !
Take this.
- Move ! Move !
- The harem is dispersed.
The king commands no one's affections.
No.
Don't kneeI to me.
I shouId kneeI to you, my Queen.
A common girI, sir ?
- The woman I Iove.
- B-B-But, my Iiege, she's a-a--
- She is not of nobIe birth.
- Nor am I.
It's a good thing too.
From our Ioins, VaIusia wiII be reborn red-bIooded and strong.
But, miIord--
- Oh !
- If you don't Iike my kingship, come take the throne.
By this ax, I ruIe.
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !

Long Iive the king !
<I>I Am Merlin, And I Am Back,</I>
Awakened From My Eternal Slumber
To Reach Out Across Time...
For A Brave Warrior Who Can

<I>Fuller. Now Look,
Just Remember What I Told You. Three Things:</I>
Ya Lean In. Ya Cover The Plate.
Ya Pick A Point In The Outfield.
Then Ya Let Her Rip.
Actually, That's
Four Things.
Just Try And Hit The Ball,
Will Ya, Fuller?
[Man]
Come On. Play Ball.
Come On, Cal!
[Cal]
Three Things:
Lean In. Cover The Plate.
Pick A Point In The Outfield.

Your Highness.
<I>[Low Rumbling]</I>
<I>[Rumbling Intensifies,

Aaah!
<I>[King's Guards Shouting]</I>
[Cal Gasping]
<I>- [Guard] Forward! Together!

Whoa!
Hold, Boy!
[Driver]
Whoa Up. Whoa Up.
Ah.
Sire.
Find The Brave Man Who
Foiled The Black Knight.
I Want To Thank Him
Personally.
Please.
- Thank Thee, Lord Belasco.
- My Pleasure, Your Highness.
Spread Out!
Find The Boy.
<I>Where Am I?</I>
Ride On!
[Cal]
Excuse Me.
[Bleating]
Oh!
Clumsy Mutton.
Sorry.
<I>[Guard]
That-A-Way.</I>
<I>[Guards Shouting]</I>
- Where Did He Go?
- That Way, Sire. He Went That Way.
This Way!
[Gasps]
Whoa.
[Cal Grunting,
Chicken Clucking]
<I>[Dog Barking]</I>
There's Nothing Left To Steal In All Of Camelot!
The King Does Not Steal.
He Merely Takes His Fair Share.
In Other Words,
Everything.
<I>- [Commoner Groaning]
- I Have No Time For This!</I>
I Am Looking For A Boy.
Do Not Fight Him.
The King Is No Longer A Man Of The People.
- You Speak Treason?
- [Cal Gasps]
Ah, The Little Mouse.
- [Cal Yelling]
- [Guard] Get Him!
Oh, Boy.
[Gasps]
Don't Kill Me!
I Didn't Mean To Do It.
I Don't Even Know What I'm Doing Here.
Take Him To Camelot.
<I>Let Me Go!</I>
The King
Awaits His Presence.
King?
[Townspeople Chattering]
Hey, Guys, Where's The Boys' Room?
I've Been Holding It Since The Third Inning.
Where We Going?
Hey, Don't I Get A Phone Call Or Something?
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
[Man]
Look Here!
Ah! 'Tis The Brave Man Who
Frightened Off The Black Knight.
Bring Him Closer.
Not A Man, Father.
Just A Boy.
He Has A Very Pleasant Face.
Don't Be Ridiculous, Sister.
He Dresses Like A Fool.
[All Laughing]
Did You Find The Boy?
Of Course.
Then Bring Him To Me.
Ah, He Was Taken To
The Great Hall, Milord.
The King.
You Take Your Orders From Me,
Not That Stupid Old Fool.
Look, I Have Arthur
Exactly Where I Want Him.
The Black Knight's Working
His Magic Wonderfully.
We Do Not Need Interlopers
Like This Little Boy Spoiling It.
Now You Are
My High Chamberlain.
Deal With It!
Dost Thou Know
Who I Am, Lad?
Um, The King?
That's Right, Lad.
I Am King Arthur.
Cool.
Cool? Ah.
[Snaps Fingers]
[All Laughing]
Ah!
<I>[Laughter Continues]</I>
Your Highness.
[Stubs Toe]
Oh!
It's Obvious This Boy Is In
League With The Black Knight.
<I>[Cal] Who Me?
No! No, I'm Not!</I>
He's Nothing But A Common Spy And A Little Thief!
I Don't Know How I Got Here, Your Honor,
But I'm Not A Spy-- Or A Thief.
Thou Has Been Challenged, Lad.
<I>Step Up And
Prove Thyself Worthy.</I>
Of Course, The, Uh, The Boy May Be Allowed
To Choose The Mode Of Combat, Hmm?
Combat?
Can We Talk About This For A Minute?
Oh, Wake Up.
This Isn't
A Dream.
Quite Right.
It's Your Worst Nightmare
Come True.
Choose.
[Muttering]
Mode Of Combat.
I Gotta Choose A Weapon.
Oh, My God. I Gotta Choose.
I Gotta Choose.
I Choose Combat Rock.
<I>- Huh?
- [Guests Murmuring]</I>
- Here Goes.
- âªâª [Rock Blaring]
âªâª [Music Stops]
[Man Exclaiming]
- 'Tis A Miracle.
- In Full-Blown Digital Stereo.
I Never Heard Such A Clamor In All My Days.
That Was No Clamor.
That Was Rock And Roll.
Come. Sit Here, Lad.
<I>Now Tell Me: What Do They Call Thee, Boy,
And From Whence Doth Thou Hail?</I>
Uh, Calvin Fuller, Sir.
From Reseda.
Oh!
[Chuckling] Knights And Ladies,
I Give Thee...
Calvin Fuller Of Reseda!
Calvin Fuller
Of Reseda!
Calvin Fuller
Of Reseda!
Well, Now, Let Us Eat.
[Guests Chattering]
Oh. Looks Real Good.
- What Is It? - Braised Boar's Snout With Haggis.
Come On. Eat Up, Boy.
I Heard What Transpired Between
Thee And The Black Knight.
Who Is This
Black Knight Guy Anyway?
A Scoundrel!
His Mission Is To Bring Down My Father's Kingdom.
Eat. It Loses Its Bouquet
When It Is Taken Cold.
<I>[Whimpering, Panting]</I>
<I>[Arthur]
Hmm, He's Got A Good Cut.</I>
Say, Where's Merlin?
When Does He Show Up?
Sadly, Merlin Passed Away
Many Years Ago.
<I>Your Highness?</I>
[Garbled]
Yes, Lad?
I Don't Mean To Butt In Here,
But Where's The Round Table?
- Round Table? - You Know,
Where You And Your Knights Have Your Meetings.
<I>It's Round So You Gotta Look Everybody In The Eye.
No Favorites. Everybody's Equal.</I>
Everybody's Equal?
[Laughing] Fascinating Idea.
- Where Did You Say You Were From?
- Uh, Reseda.
Reseda.
What An Odd Name.
Hey, It's The Bowling
Capital Of The World.
May I Suggest For Our Honored
Visitor From Reseda...
A Fortnight Of Training
With Master Kane?
<I>Oh, A Splendid Idea, Daughter.
Tomorrow, My Master At Arms...</I>
Shall Instruct Thee In The Ways
Of The Knights Of Camelot.
Prepare His Quarters!
Come On!
[Belches, Slurps]
Welcome To
Camelot, Sir.
Thanks... I Think.
Okay, Where's The Bathroom?
Lord Elastic!
Belasco.
Right.
Listen.
[Whispering]
What?
I Don't Hear Anything.
Exactly!
I Could Choke The Life
Right Out Of You Right Now.
No One Would
Hear You Scream.
Hold That Thought.
[Creaking]
[Kiai]
Hyah!
Oh! Excuse Me, Good Sir.
Pardon My Intrusion.
My Father Asked That I Make Sure Thou
Art Comfortable In Thy New Quarters.
You Want Me Comfortable, How About Getting
Me A Road Map Out Of The Middle Ages?
If I Don't Get Home,
I'm Grounded.
You Resedians Wear
Very Strange Garments.
Oh! Excuse Me.
Okay.
<I>Wait. Your Father
Sent You Here?</I>
[Murmuring]
I Cannot Lie To Thee, Sir. My Father Knows
Nothing Of My Nocturnal Transgression.
Do Me A Favor.
Call Me "Calvin."
Calvin.
That Dance.
What Was It?
<I>Dance?</I>
You Know.
Oh. That's Not A Dance.
That's Karate.
You See, There Was This Big Kid Who Was Beating
Me Up Every Day And Stealing My Lunch Money,
So My Dad Signed Me Up
For Karate School.
I Really Miss Them.
My Sister Too.
You Have No Idea What I'm Talking About,
Do You?
I Fear I Know Nothing Of
Karate Or Lunch Money,
But I Do Know What It Is Like To Miss One's Parents.
My Father Has Never Been
The Same Since Mother Died.
I Miss My Mother Deeply.
I Miss My Father Even More.
I Really Need To Get Home, Katey.
Can You Help Me?
I Truly Cannot.
Perhaps There Is
Somebody Who Can!
- Who?
- Merlin.
- But You Said He Was Dead.
- Not Quite.
<I>[Rock Moving]</I>
<I>Cool.
A Secret Door.</I>
Come.
[Rumbling]
This Way.
<I>[Wind Whistling]</I>
We've Lost The Light!
[Chuckles]
No Problem.
It's Incredible!
<I>[Cal] Just Like The Temple Of Doom.</I>
This Is It.
<I>[Stones Creaking]</I>
These Were Once Merlin's Quarters.
'Tis Now My Father's Private Sanctuary.
<I>[Cal] Is That-- Aw, It Can't Be.</I>
Oh, That. That's Just
Father's Old Sword.
"Old Sword"?
That's Excalibur.
My, Thou Dost
Know A Lot.
I Watch A Lot Of Cnn.
No One's Touched It
In Years.
'Tis True.
Wow, You Even Have
A Hot Tub.
'Tis The Well Of Destiny.
Oh.
That Is All That
Remains Of Merlin.
If There Is A Way Home,
It Will Be In There.
Sweet.
Quick.
Someone Comes. Hurry!
Here Is Where
We Must Part.
There's Something Very Special About You,
Calvin Of Reseda.
Perhaps Your Arrival Here
Was No Accident.
Hey, How Do I Get Back?
Follow The Wall.
It Stops At Your Quarters.
Good Night, Sir.
<I>Ah, The Knight I Sent For.</I>
<I>Come To The Well So That I May
Gaze Upon The Face Of Greatness.</I>
Who Said That?
<I>Come.
Come.</I>
<I>We Haven't Much Time.</I>
Is Someone Down There?
What Are You Doing Here, Boy?
Stand Aside So I May See My Great Warrior.
<I>Where Is He? Come, Come.
Step Forward.</I>
Um, I Hate To Tell You This,
But I'm The Only One Here.
- You Must Be Joking.
- No.
You're Merlin, Right?
Something Has Gone Horribly Wrong.
What Was That Wretched Spell I Cast?
Half A Quart Of Pig Vomit
And The Two Monkey Bladders?
- Pig Vomit?
- Or Was It The Other Way Around?
Good Lord!
<I>Oh, I Get It.</I>
This Is All A Big Mistake. That's Okay.
Everybody Picks Me Last.
No, I Couldn't Have Got It Wrong.
But Look At You!
<I>What Manner Of Armor Is That?
And That Animal Sleeping On Your Head.</I>
Animal?
It's My Hair!
Look, Your Wetness,
I Don't Understand Any Of This.
- And What Am I Doing Here?
- I Brought You Here...
To Save Camelot.
<I>- Me? - Arthur Is In Trouble.
His Kingdom Has Been Shattered...</I>
By The Iron Fist
Of Lord Belasco.
Oh, The Dork In The Purple Dress.
We've Met.
And You Haven't Seen The Last Of Him.
He Is A Dangerous Man.
<I>He Means To Steal Camelot
From Arthur. And You...</I>
Are Going To Stop Him.
Look, You Definitely
Have The Wrong Guy.
Why Don't You Just Send Me Home?
I Mean, My Family Really Needs Me.
Camelot Needs You!
[Groaning]
Help Arthur
Find His Way Back,
And I Will Help You
Find Yours.
[Sighs]
[Battle Cry,
Shield Clanging]
Nicely Done.
Thank You.
Now, Would You Care To Show
Us How It Is Done In Reseda?
Uh, Actually I Was
Hoping For A Desk Job.
<I>As From Today,
You're A Knight In Training.</I>
Thanks, But I Won't
Be Here That Long.
<I>Don't Tell Me...</I>
A Brave Lad Like You,
Who Faced The Full Fury Of The Black Knight,
Is Afraid Of A Dummy.
Uh, No Way.
I Was Just Testing You.
[Clangs]
God, These Things Are A Lot
Heavier Than They Look On Tv.
"Tv"? One Of Your Knights Of Reseda,
No Doubt?
Uh, Something Like That.
Good Fit.
Can You See?
Perfectly.
Oh, It Smells Like
Something Died In Here.
Excuse Me.
[Grunting]
<I>- [Kane] This Way.
- [Cal] Yeah, I Knew That.</I>
There. Whoa!
Calvin?
Yeah?
Remember Three Things:
Lean In.
Protect Your Steed.
Fix A Point On Your Opponent's
Person And Have At Him.
That's Four Things.
What?
Never Mind.
Hit It.
Ah!
<I>[Splashing]</I>
<I>Well, I'd Like To See
You Try That.</I>
I Thought All Knights Spent Their Time
Rescuing Damsels And Fighting Dragons.
What Are They All
Doing Here?
They're All Training Hard
For The Big Tournament.
You See,
The Prize Is Quite Appealing To All Men Of Royal Blood.
Really?
What's The Prize?
My Sister.
And Camelot.
What About Her?
Doesn't She Have A Choice?
She Has Refused All Suitors.
Therefore,
On Her 21st Birthday,
The Tournament
Must Decide For Her.
Bummer.
I Think I Agree.
Come. You Try.
<I>[Cat Screeching]</I>
You Are The Most Exquisite
Flower In This Garden, Princess.
There Is One Major Difference Between The
Garden Flowers And Myself, Lord Belasco.
Mmm?
A Rose Will Prick You,
But I Will Do Far Worse.
You Cut Me To The Quick.
All I Want Is What Is Best
For My King And His Kingdom.
Camelot Could Be Great.
We Could Make It Great Again.
"We"?
Yes, Of Course.
The Two Of Us Together,
In Wedded Bliss.
I Will Marry The Man
Who Wins The Tournament.
Enter It...
If You Have The Nerve.
Good Day, Sir.
So, Master Kane,
Where's Your Castle?
Oh, I Have No Land
Of My Own.
Does That Mean You Can't Enter The Tournament?
Alas, The Tournament Is Reserved
For Far Better Men Than I.
No Way.
You're The Best.
If Thou Art Trying
To Get On My Good Side,
Thou Has Succeeded
With Royal Colors.
<I>Ah. Here Is Thy Opponent.</I>
Wait!
I Can't Fight The Princess.
You Are Right
About That, Sir.
Come.
I Wonder.
Do The Knights
Of Reseda Swim?
You Have Much To Learn
Before Supper.
I Hear The Kitchen Is Serving A Poached
Goat's Head In A Brown Grub Sauce.
Oh!
Or Perhaps We Could
Catch Yon Goose.
[Grunting]
Oh. Whoa!
<I>[Laughing]</I>
Oh, Geez.
I Cannot Believe I Fell For The Oldest Trick In The Book.
<I>Then Again,
Since I'm Here,</I>
<I>Maybe It's The Newest
Trick In The Book.</I>
Hey. How's It Goin'?
Ah, Good Sir. My Shop
Is At Your Service.
Really? Well, Thanks. Uh,
I Hear You Can Make Anything.
Indeed, I Have
That Reputation.
What About This?
By The Circle Builders
Themselves.
Well, I Need Another Pair, Like, Yesterday.
Ah.
- Who's There?
- I Trust You Slept Well?
<I>Yeah. We All Did-- Me And The Forest
Of Crawling Things Living In My Bed.</I>
<I>All Right.</I>
Come. Breakfast Is Served In The Great Hall.
We Must Hurry Or We'll Be Late.
Just A Minute.
I Have Somethin' To Show Ya.
What Is It For?
[Princess Gasping,
Both Laughing]
Come On.
This Way.
Oh, Careful.
Come On.
So If It's "Bad,"
It's Good.
Right.
And If It's "Cool,"
It's Hot.
Oh, I Fear I Will Never
Understand Your Valley Speak.
Well, Belasco. What Dost Thou
Wish To Speak About?
<I>Decisions, Your Highness.
It's Time You Made One.</I>
What Didst Thou
Have In Mind?
I've Been Loyal To You
For Years, Your Highness,
And All I Ask For In Return
Is Sarah's Hand In Marriage.
Thou Knowest
The Laws Of Camelot.
The Tournament
Shall Decide For Her.
The Fate Of Camelot Cannot Rest
Upon The Folly Of A Tournament.
Can It, Your Highness?
I-- I Shall Speak To My Daughter On Thy Behalf.
- I Thank Thee, Your Highness.
- Watch Out!
[Belasco
Gasping]
Hey, The Round Table.
History Books Are Gonna Love Ya.
<I>Not Staying For Breakfast,
Lord Belasco?</I>
I Do Not Eat With Children!
Well, Sit, Sit
Before It Gets Cold.
So What's
For Breakfast?
Leftovers!
Mmm.
Guard It
With Your Life.
Go For It.
<I>For What Do We Owe This Unexpected Pleasure,
Lord Belasco?</I>
Out Of My Way, Teacher.
Well, If You've Had Enough
Of Fighting Wooden Men,
How Do You Fancy Taking On
A Real Man For A Change?
But, Sir--
This Has Nothing To Do
With You, Teacher.
Boy, You Guys Are Really Hung Up On This
Dominant Male Monkey Thing, Aren't You?
- I Take It Your Answer's No.
- Calvin!
[Groaning]
I Could Be Wrong,
But I Think I Just Qualified For A Black Belt.
You'd Better Use It
To Hang Yourself With,
Because When I Come For You,
It'll Be Worse.
Far, Far Worse.
[Groaning]
As A Reward,
Thou Hast Earned A Grand Supper.
On One Condition.
What Is That?
I Do The Cooking.
Oh.
Mmm, Smells Divine.
What Is It?
<I>A Surprise, Princess.</I>
- Oh, No! Those Are Poisonous Love Apples.
- Trust Me.
<I>And No Peeking.</I>
It Smells So Wonderful
I Can Hardly Wait.
Patience.
Okay. You Can Look Now.
'Tis Beautiful,
But What Is It?
It's A Meal Fit
For The Round Table:
Double Cheeseburger,
Lettuce And Tomato On A Whole Wheat Bun.
- What?
- Big Mac.
Mmm. It's Good!
<I>I Mean... "Bad."</I>
Thou Called
For Me, Father?
I Did? Oh, Yes, Yes, Yes.
Of Course I Did.
Oh, My Dear Daughter,
I Believe I Know What Is
Best For My Kingdom.
I Mean, A Game To Settle
The Fate Of Camelot?
I Fear The Tournament
Is An Outdated Notion.
Thou Art Dancing, Father.
Get To The Point.
I Have Decided That Thou Shalt Marry Lord Belasco.
If I Cannot
Marry For Love,
Then The Law Of The Land
Will Prevail.
I Shall Let
The Tournament Decide.
Thou Art As Stubborn
As Thy Mother.
Riding Isn't As Hard
As I Thought.
Avert Thy Eyes.
[Clicking Tongue]
Thou Was Not To See That.
Swear Your Silence To Me Now, Sir, Or Risk My Wrath.
Hey, It's None
Of My Business--
Swear It!
Okay, Okay!
I Swear It.
Can We Put This Off
'Til Next Tuesday?
It Is Time To Put
A Real Lance In Your Hand.
Look, This Is Too Soon.
I Still Get Car Sick On Merry-Go-Rounds.
Lean Into The Charge And The
Lance Will Do The Work For You.
<I>Why Don't You
Do The Work For Me?</I>
<I>Hast Thou No...</I>
Confidence In Thyself?
[Horse Whinnies]
Look! There's
A Two-Headed Dragon!
I See Only Trees.
Yeah. Maybe I Need
To Get My Eyes Checked.
<I>Calvin, Perhaps
You're Not Quite Ready.</I>
Of Course I Am.
Let Her Rip, Professor.
Hyah!
Whoa!
Whoa.
[Panting] No. No, No!
Go Left! Go Left!
- Hold It! Oh!
- [Horse Whinnying]
Oh. Aah!
Calvin?
[Groaning]
Look What You've Done.
How Could You?
- But, Princess, It Was You Who Asked--
- How Dare You Contradict Me?
This Is Your Fault!
Ohh.
I'm So Sorry.
Please Speak To Me.
You Deceived Me!
Thou Art Impertinent!
[Laughing] Ow!
Honest, Princess-- Wait!
[Laughing]
You Are A Clever Lad.
I Think She Likes Me.
Did Not Expect To See You Again So Soon, Sir.
The Blade Rollers Did Not Meet With Satisfaction?
No, No, They Were
A Killer.
But This Time,
I Need Somethin' Bigger.
Bigger?
It's Gotta Be Light As A Feather
But Hard As Belasco's Head.
I Know Of
No Such Metal.
You Will.
Melt This And That Together,
Stir...
And Then Stand Back.
How Does A Boy
Know So Much?
Metal Shop,
Eighth Grade.
See, You Start
With The Frame.
<I>What Is It,
Sister?</I>
Distress.
Burning Of The Heart.
No, 'Tis Not
Heartburn.
'Tis Heartache.
You Are In Love,
Little One.
Don't Be Silly!
Can't Hide Anything
From You, Can I?
I Know It All
Too Well Myself.
Does It Always
Hurt This Much?
Oh, Sometimes
It Hurts Much Worse.
Poor Father.
Every Day He Drifts
Further Away From Us.
What Is To Become
Of Our Family, Sarah?
I Know Not,
But I Will Always
Look After Thee.
Farewell, My Beauties.
What Are Thou
Eating, Lad?
Oh, Mad Dog Bubble Gum.
What?
Here.
No! You're Not
Supposed To Swallow.
You're Not?
[Sighs]
Here. Just Put It
In Your Mouth And Chew.
Chew.
Never Swallow.
Never Swallow.
Then What Is
Its Purpose?
There Is No Purpose.
No Purpose?
Strange.
Why Do They Call It
"Mad Dog Bubble Gum"?
I Have No Idea,
Your Highness.
[Muffled]
Mmm. Lord Belasco.
Uh-- Mmm.
Take A Seat.
Get Out.
Affairs Of The Court, Lad.
You Understand.
It's Okay.
I Have A Date.
- "Date"?
- I'll Explain Later.
Have You Spoken
To Your Daughter?
Yes, Of Course, Of Course.
And?
Well, I Cannot Force Her
To Marry Thee.
But If She Means That Much To You,
I Mean,
There's Always
The Tournament.
She Will Be Mine.
No One Will Have Her.
Ah, So You Are Planning
To Enter The Tournament.
Are You
A Complete Idiot?
Do You Think
I Want To Die?
There's Another Way.
[Door Closing]
I Came Only Because My Music Lessons Were Cancelled.
You're Still
Impertinent.
I'll Take That As A Compliment.
State Your Business
And I Shall Be On My Way.
I Have A Surprise For You.
What Is It?
It's A Mountain Bike.
What Is It For?
In Reseda,
We Have A Custom.
It's Called A Picnic.
Hop On.
Watch Your Step.
Here We Go.
Look At That.
Oh!
It's Not So Bad,
Is It?
'Tis So Fast.
You Know The Night You Took Me
To See Merlin's Book Of Spells?
Mm-Hmm.
Well, I Went Back,
And I Don't Know If I'm Goin' Crazy Or What,
But I Saw Merlin In The Well.
He Came To You?
Yeah, He Said That He
Brought Me Here To Save Camelot.
<I>Well, Actually,
He Didn't Bring Me Here.</I>
He-- He Meant
To Bring Someone Else.
He Chose Well.
What Are The Girls Like
In Reseda?
I Don't Know.
Course You Do.
Well, They're
Nothing Like You.
<I>[Horse Nickering]</I>
<I>[Townspeople Chattering]</I>
<I>[Man] Now What Do You Make Of That?</I>
<I>[People Chattering]</I>
<I>[Man] Hurry,
Before Belasco's Men Come!</I>
<I>[Cal] Boy,
They Sure Are Hungry.</I>
<I>[Woman] Better Save The Rest.
'Tis Lord Belasco I Fear.</I>
Where Did It All
Come From?
<I>[Man] Our Only Friend--</I>
<I>- [Whinnying]
- [Child] God Bless The Black Knight!</I>
The Black Knight
Is One Of The Good Guys?
It Cannot Be True.
Are You Okay?
Confused.
About The Black Knight?
And Other Things.
I Shall Never Forget
This Moment.
Hey, Where You Going?
[Sighs]
I'll Walk You
To Your Room.
Old Reseda Custom.
The More I Hear Of Reseda,
The More I Want To See It.
I Wish I Could
Take You There.
Good Night.
Princess,
I Haven't Had This Much Fun
In My Whole Life.
I Know You're Worried
About Your Father.
<I>[Cal Continues]
Me Too.</I>
<I>I Promise I'll Do Everything I Can To
Keep Belasco From Screwing Things Up.</I>
I Guess That's All.
Oh, Yeah.
You're A Great Kisser.
Wise Girl.
Come On!
One Sound And It
Would Have Been Your Last.
[Rumbling]
Get In There!
Come With Me!
[Katey
Screaming]
[Katey]
Help Me!
Hah!
<I>[Whip Cracking]</I>
What Sorcery Is This, Merlin, That I'm No
Longer Able To Brandish The Sword Excalibur?
<I>I Thought With Thee,
I Would Reign Forever.</I>
<I>I Was Wrong.</I>
Camelot Rots,
And I Play At Being King.
<I>I Want Her
Great Again.</I>
But I Fear I'm Too Weak
To Bring Her Back.
Oh, Guinevere.
My Guinevere.
<I>I'm Too Old.
I'm Too Tired.</I>
<I>Go Ahead.
Take It.</I>
<I>I Want You
To Have It.</I>
We Need To Talk.
<I>Oh.</I>
You're Not Trying To Dodge Your
Way Out Of Our Deal, Are You?
Oh, No, No,
Nothin' Like That.
- Hmm?
- I'm Just Not So Sure I Wanna Go Home Yet.
Ohh.
Of Course.
The Princess Katherine.
Yeah. She's Incredible.
True, But You Won't Have Much Of
A Honeymoon In Belasco's Dungeon.
- Good Point.
- I Suggest You Take Excalibur.
<I>- What About Arthur?
- You Must Lead The Way.</I>
Now.
Wait!
- Was There Something Else?
- Aren't You Gonna Wish Me Luck?
Very Well.
Good Luck.
Are You Going To Need It.
<I>Ah! Princess.
So Good Of You To Come On Such Short Notice.</I>
Your Servant Said I Would Be Supremely
Interested In What You Have To Say.
Well, He Did Not
Exaggerate.
Then Say It
And I Shall Be On My Way.
How Dare You!
When My Father Hears How You're Treating Me--
Look, I Didn't Bring You Here To Listen
To Your Incessant Royal Prattle!
Now Shut Your Mouth And Your
Sister Will Remain Unharmed.
What Have You Done
With My Sister?
She's Safe.
For Now.
But I'm Getting Tired Of Waiting
For You To Accept My Offer.
You Are Mad.
You Cannot Force Me
To Marry You.
Well, If You Do Not Consent,
Then Princess Katherine Will Die.
This Pact Is Between You And Me.
You Utter One Word Of This To Anyone...
And You'll Never See
Your Sister Again.
I Await Your Answer.
You Have Until
The Tournament.
Sweet Dreams.
Night-Night.
Huh?
- What Do You Want?
- You're Under Arrest...
For The Murder
Of Princess Katherine.
Seize Him.
[Yells]
[Grunts]
Find Him
And Then Kill Him.
Calvin, I Must
Speak To You Of Katey.
I Didn't Do It. All We Did Was Go On A Picnic.
I Swear. I Didn't Kill Her.
She's Been Kidnapped Under Belasco's Orders.
I Need Your Help.
My Help?
You Must Bring Her Back.
<I>Ahem. All Right,
This Way.</I>
They're Looking For Me.
Belasco Tried To Arrest Me.
Then You Only Have One Chance.
Just One, Huh?
My Father--
Give Him This.
He Will Know You Speak The Truth.
<I>- Guards. He Went This Way.
- Come With Me.</I>
Calvin.
Calvin, Come.
Huh?
[Panting]
[Snores]
<I>[Crashing]</I>
<I>By Merlin's Prophecies,
Dost Thou Come At Me In My Sleep?</I>
<I>[Grunts] Thou Shalt Not Take Me That Easily.</I>
Come Into The Light,
You Cowards!
Calvin, Which Way
Did They Flee?
How Many Were There?
Five? Ten?
Oh, The Royal Blood Is Pumping Now.
Leave Us Ride After The Interlopers.
Sire, Stop! There Are No
Interlopers Or Outer-Lopers.
Don't Be Ridiculous, Boy.
Get Me My Royal Wardrobe.
The Hunt Is On.
Katey Has Been Kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
My Baby Is Sleeping
With The Goats?
She's Been
Taken Prisoner.
That's Impossible.
Belasco's Orders.
But I Would Trust Belasco
With My Life.
Bad Idea, Sire.
You've Been Faked Out, Played For A Sucker.
Your Chain Has Been Royally Pulled.
All Right, Boy,
I Get The Point.
Belasco Plans On Stealing
Camelot Just Like He Stole Katey.
I Cannot Believe It.
So, It's All True.
<I>[Knocking]</I>
Yes? Who Is It?
<I>Lord Belasco, Your Highness.</I>
Oh, Lord Belasco.
Why Art Thou Disturbing My Sleep?
I'm Sorry,
Your Highness.
I Have Some Terrible News.
Princess Katherine Is Dead.
Dead? Katey?
My Poor,
Poor Katey Dead!
Who Has Done This?
Calvin Of Reseda,
Your Highness.
Calvin Of Reseda!
<I>After I Fed Him And Clothed Him,
This Is The Thanks I Get!</I>
Why Art Thou Wasting My Time?
Find The Boy. Bring Me His Head On A Pike.
Your Wish Is
My Command, Sire.
He'll Be Dead By Daybreak,
Your Highness.
Calvin? Calvin?
Ah. My Artifice Was
Well Nigh Rewarded, Lad.
He Bought It?
He Bought It.
You Know Where They
Might've Taken Her?
I Do Indeed, Lad.
[Driver] Hyah!
Come On! [Cracks Whip]
What Are You Going
To Do With Me?
Nothing...
If Your Sister Gives Herself
To Lord Belasco In Betrothal.
In You Go.
And If She Doesn't?
Hmm.
<I>[Cal] Anyway,
We're Gonna Have To Go In Disguise.</I>
Disguise?
Yeah, I Figure
If We Look Like...
Miserable, Starving,
Pathetic Peasants, No One Will Notice.
Peasants? Hmph!
Don't Be Ridiculous, Boy.
The Royal Pendragon Strikes Fear
Into The Hearts Of My Enemies.
Not Anymore It Doesn't.
What Do You Know, Boy?
They Hate You.
Hate Me?
Belasco's Been Stealing
From Your People For Years.
There's Nothing But Sickness
And Starvation In Camelot, And...
They Think You Don't
Care About Them.
They Hate Me.
You Do Care,
Don't You?
Of Course I Do, Lad.
Come. I Know
A Way Out.
[Arthur, Cal
Yelling]
<I>[Pigs Grunting,
Squealing]</I>
[Hiccups, Burps]
Yuck!
More Boar Snouts?
<I>[Cal] Come On.
This Is Where We Get Off. Jump.</I>
Oh! [Chuckling] I Rather Like This:
Out Among My Own People.
Watch Whom You Bathe,
O Washerwoman.
Washerwoman, Eh? And Who Do You Think You Are?
The Bloody King Of England?
<I>As A Matter Of Fact,
I Am Your King.</I>
<I>And I'm
Cleo-Bleedin'-Patra.</I>
Come On. Let's Go.
If Thou Were A Man,
I Would Call Thee Out!
If You Were A Man,
I'd Throw More Than A Bath Over Ya.
Let's Go.
Stop!
Look, Your Majesty,
I Don't Wanna Insult You, But Are You Nuts?
This Isn't The Castle Where Everyone Kisses Your Butt.
This Is The Real, In-Your-Face,
Car-Jacking, Drive-By-Shooting,
Kill-You-For-Your-Reeboks Street Life.
What Language
Art Thou Speaking, Boy?
Let Me Give It To You Straight.
They Find Out You're The King, You're Dead Meat.
The Murderer!
Come On, Men!
[Shouting, Yelling]
[Groaning]
[Groaning]
[Groaning]
Merlin,
Where Art Thou Now?
Sire!
Sire, Run!
<I>[Soldiers Groaning]</I>
We Are Lost.
The Royal Stables Is Under Heavy Guard.
We Shall Never
Reach The Princess In Time.
Yeah, We Will.
Huh?
This Is Sorcery!
We Are Going To Die!
Your Highness,
Are You Okay?
If "Okay" Means A Sore Bum,
Then Yes. [Groans]
- Great.
- The Black Knight!
After Him!
Chill Out.
He's On Our Side.
On Our Side?
I Don't Understand.
[Sighs]
Let's Boogie.
Boogie?
Boogie?
I'm So Sorry About
The Princess Katey.
I Missed You
Desperately.
I Came Not For Comfort.
I Came To Say Good-Bye.
Good-Bye?
Oh, Dear Sweet Kane,
I Have Lost Everyone I Have Ever Loved,
And Now I Have Lost You.
No! You Have
Not Lost Me.
No Matter What We Think, No Matter How We Feel,
Our Lives Are Not Our Own.
Well, Then, We Will
Make Them Our Own.
It Is Too Late.
I Must Marry Lord Belasco.
Come On, Men!
We've Got Him!
Go On.
Right.
You Know,
When I Was A Boy,
Much The Same As You,
I Could Not Face The Things I Feared.
It Was By Sheer Accident I Pulled
The Sword Excalibur From The Stone.
Oh, It's True Over The Years I
Grew Into A Strong King, But...
Now, Alas,
I Fear I've Become That Cowering Boy Again.
I've Lost All Faith
In Myself.
And If I Cannot Believe
In Myself, Who Will?
You Know, Sire,
Where I Come From, There Are No Swords In
Stones That Turn Dweebs Like Me Into Heroes.
I Used To Think
I Needed One.
But You Know What?
I Don't.
You're A Good Man,
Calvin Fuller.
This Is Impossible.
There's No Way Into This Place.
How Did You Say It?
"Chill Out."
[Sighs]
[Horses Neigh]
Cool.
A Secret Passage.
Ahh. Merlin Showed It
To Me Long Ago...
When I Played Here
As A Boy.
[Squeaking]
- [Shrieks]
- Shh.
<I>Help!</I>
He's Got Her
In The Dungeon.
<I>[Shrieking]</I>
Hey, You.
Hey, Where Do You Think You're Going?
Bow To The King,
You Dog!
- Father!
- Katey!
Oh, I Knew You'd Come!
<I>[Cal]
Hi.</I>
You Wouldn't Happen
To Have A Key, Would Ya?
I Have Something
Better, Lad.
A Father's Love
For A Daughter.
And A King's Shoulder!
Ohh!
Ah! I'm Sorry, Lad.
I'm No Match For Merlin's Door.
Maybe Not.
But This Is.
- What Sorcery Is This?
- A Swiss Army Knife.
<I>"A Swiss Army Knife."
The Very Name Conjures Up Greatness.</I>
Yeah, It's Right Up There With Harley Davidson.
Cool.
Come, Daughter.
Come. Quick. Come.
Guards!
[Groaning]
Nice One.
Shh.
Your Majesty.
- Welcome.
- We're In Big Trouble.
<I>- What I'd Give For Excalibur Now.
- You've Got It.</I>
[Excalibur Ringing,
Vibrating]
[Screams]
[Grunts]
<I>[Cal]
Behind You, Katey!</I>
Gee, This Always Works
In The Movies.
Hyah!
<I>[Katey Screams]</I>
<I>- Help! Let Me Down!
- [Arthur] Katey!</I>
Katey!
After Him, Boy!
[Katey Screams]
Let Me Go!
Richard. Stay Where You Are.
Let My Daughter Go.
Stop There!
Or She Flies Like A Bird.
<I>- No, Take Me!
- Stay Put!</I>
Or Her Blood Will Be
On Your Hands, Boy.
Come. We'll
Charge Together.
I Have A Better Idea.
<I>Oh, I'm Afraid Rock And Roll
Will Not Work This Time.</I>
You're Wrong.
It Is The Great Equalizer.
[Screaming]
Oh, Calvin.
So, What About Me?
Father.
[Both Sighing]
[Cal]
Why Are We Stopping Here?
Come.
This Is As Fine
A Place As Any.
For What, Sire?
Kneel, Lad.
- Kneel?
- Just Do It.
Calvin Fuller
Of Reseda,
Dost Thou Swear Allegiance
To Thy King And Thy Kingdom?
Dost Thou Swear To Uphold The Laws Of Camelot?
And To Always Follow The Paths
Of Righteousness And Goodness?
I'll Try, Your Highness.
I Will.
Then Let All
Who Witness This Know--
It Doth Not Take A Sword
In Stone To Make A Hero.
By The Sword Excalibur,
I Dub Thee...
Knight Of The Round Table.
Arise... Sir Calvin
Of Reseda.
We Have Some
Unfinished Business.
Thank You For Coming.
Your Wish
Is My Command, Princess.
Made Your Decision Yet?
Yes.
And?
I Will Consent
To Marry You.
I Always Knew You Were
The Smart One In The Family.
Oh, Thank God.
Oh, Father!
I See You Have Your Old Friend With You.
I Do Indeed,
Dear Daughter.
I, Too, Am Delivered.
You're Looking, Uh,
Extremely Well, Your Highness.
If You'll Excuse Me, I'll Go And Get Ready For
The Tournament. Welcome Back, Darling.
You're Gonna Let Him Walk After All He's Done?
Well, I'm Not.
Wait, Lad.
Now Remember:
The People Believe Me To Be A Coward,
And The Guards Are Still Loyal To Belasco.
Bide Thy Time, Young Knight.
When The Hour Is Nigh, We'll Nail Him.
<I>Father.</I>
My People--
<I>My People,</I>
You Belong To The Land,
And So Do I.
I Was But A Stable Boy When I Pulled Excalibur
From The Stone And You Made Me Your King.
For Years, Together,
We Made Camelot Great.
And Then I Turned
My Back On You.
<I>I Betrayed Your Trust.</I>
But, My People,
I Shall Fail You
No Longer!
From This Day Henceforth,
The Tournament Shall Be
Open To All Free Men.
<I>[Crowd Cheering]</I>
And Let It Be Known:
The Great Sword Excalibur,
Camelot,
My Daughter's Hand,
<I>All Shall Belong
To My Successor,</I>
<I>The Last Man Unhorsed
In Honorable Combat.</I>
Let The Tournament Begin.
<I>[Crowd Cheering]</I>
That's Your Cue,
Professor.
I Can't Believe My Ears.
Go, Son.
Prepare Thyself.
Thou Deserveth A Place
In My Court.
Let's Go, Loverboy.
You Still Gotta Win This Turkey.
Here.
I've Been Saving This For A Special Occasion.
<I>It's Called
A Candy Bar.</I>
Is It Food?
Compared To What You're Used To,
It's Gourmet Dining.
You Are Truly
A Great Knight.
<I>[Crowd Applauding,
Cheering]</I>
[Neighs]
You Have Defeated
All Opponents.
Only One Of You Will Leave
This Field Of Honor...
<I>And One Day Rule
In My Stead.</I>
Kick His Butt.
[Whimpers]
No!
I Fear That Kane
Is Defeated.
Hey, You Know The Rules.
He's Still On His Horse.
He's Right, Father. As Long As He's On His Steed,
He's Still In The Game.
Stall Him.
I'll Be Right Back.
It Is Done.
I Claim My Victory.
As You've Not Unhorsed Master Kane,
He Is Not Yet Defeated.
- But, Sire--
- Rules Are Rules.
Very Well Then.
I Shall Await The Allotted Time.
Then You Can Proclaim My Legacy.
Ah, I Can Hardly Wait.
Hurry.
Sir Kane, How Many Fingers
Am I Holding Up?
Just A Little Off The Top.
Keep The Sideburns.
He Speaks In Tongues.
Hey! Where Are
You Going?
To Announce Sir Kane's Defeat.
He's Not Defeated.
He's--
He's Meditating.
Oh, Hurry, Calvin.
The Time Has Passed, Your Highness.
Please, Declare My Victory.
Wrong Again... Dweeb.
<I>[Crowd Cheering]</I>
<I>[Crowd]
Ohh!</I>
'Tis Black Magic.
You're History, Belasco.
Your Blood Is Mine!
Hey, Chill Out, Dude!
[Yells]
Prepare To Meet
Thy Ancestors.
<I>[Grunting]
He's Got My Cloth!</I>
[Crowd Laughing,
Cheering]
Thou Hast Won The Tournament,
Sir Knight.
Sarah's Hand Is Thine.
Sarah?
But I Hardly Know Her.
Oh, It Is Not A Question Of Familiarity.
It Is A Question Of Victory. Isn't It?
No, Father.
It Is Not.
Hmm.
Listen, I'm Not Your Knight In Shining Armor.
He Is.
It Seems I Owe Thee More Than One Debt Of Gratitude,
Sir Knight.
Reveal Thyself So That
We May All Know Thee.
[People Murmuring]
Who Is It?
<I>[Crowd]
Ohh!</I>
Hello, Father.
<I>[Woman]
The Princess!</I>
Daughter.
Daughter,
Thou Hast Won
The Right To Choose.
<I>[Woman] God Bless Princess Sarah And Master Kane!</I>
<I>[Crowd Cheers]</I>
[Grunting]
<I>As For Thee, Lord Belasco,
Thou Art Banished From My Kingdom Forever.</I>
<I>If I Were Thee,
I Would Not Stop Until Thou Reachest--</I>
- Cucamonga.
- Cucamonga.
Cucamonga?
You Are
A Great Knight.
I Had
A Great Teacher.
<I>Sir Calvin.</I>
My Kingdom Is Thine.
What Dost Thou Want?
A Castle? A Dukedom?
I Just Wanna Go Home.
Godspeed, Sir Calvin.
You've Given Me So Much.
Is There Anything I Can Give You?
No.
[Chuckles]
I Wouldn't Mind
That Swiss Army Knife.
Is There Nothing I Can Say Or Do To Make You Stay?
I Have To Go Back.
You Won't Forget Me?
How Could I?
I'm Ready, Merlin.
You Have Done Well,
Brave Knight.
<I>Thank You,
Sir Calvin.</I>
And Now It's Time For Me To
Keep My End Of The Bargain.
Behold:
Your Way Home.
Are You Sure About This?
<I>[Merlin]
Trust Me.</I>
I'm Back.
There Wasn't
Any Earthquake.
You're Up, Fuller.
- Ventilate 'Em, Calvin.
- He Brought Me Back Before I Struck Out.
Try Swingin' This Time,
Fuller.
Thanks, Hal.
I Love Your Tan.
<I>[Cheering]
Come On! Whoo!</I>
<I>It's Only A Game, Son.
Just Give It Your Best Shot.</I>
<I>[Mother] Good Luck, Honey.
We're All Rootin' For Ya.</I>
I Get Your Room
If You Get Killed.
- You Got It.
- Yes! Yes!
Relax. Just Remember
What I Told You.
Three Things,
Right, Coach?
Go For It, Kid.
<I>[Crowd]
Yea!</I>
[Crowd Cheering] Come On!
Come On! You Can Do It!
<I>[Arthur]
Calvin.</I>
<I>Remember: It Does Not Take A
Sword In Stone To Make A Hero.</I>
You're Dead Meat,
Fuller.
Not This Time, Baker.
[Shrieks]
Run!
Nice Going, Fuller.
Katey?
[Chuckling]
You Were Great.
<I>I Knew You
Could Do It!</I>
Taught The Kid
Everything He Knows.
From the dawn of time we came, moving silently among you... down through the centuries... immortals.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.
After the death of my friend Ramirez,
And my beloved wife Heather,
I left my home in the highlands of Scotland... and began to wander the world searching for answers.
Finally, I came to Japan... to the mountains of Niri and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.
From a faraway land comes another, the most feared and evil among us.
He keeps growing stronger everyday, feeding on the power of other immortals.
Soon, there will be none left who can stop him.
If he wins, the world will suffer eternal damnation.
Who is he?
His name is Kane.
The mountain of Niri, where is it?
What for?
Listen! Where is the mountain of Niri?
Do you seek the power of the sorcerer Nakano?
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.
- Burn it down!
- Yeah!
- Hyah!
- No! Oh!
Come on!
Hey!
How do I kill him?
With a heart, soul and steel.
I've heard that before.
I know.
Ramirez.
Like him,
I have lived many lifetimes.
And like him, my gift to you is my knowledge.
The knowledge does not come easy, Highlander.
Nothing is what it seems,
Highlander.
First, you must be aware and respect the power of illusion.
You have already lost.
Fight with your spirit... and the sword will follow.
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.
Just strike at my head and you will take all my knowledge.
I will not.
Not even for the power of illusion?
Not even.
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.
Oh, yes.
This is the place.
- Shh. You have to go now.
- What?
Shh. Trust me.
You must leave.
Nakano.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Why do I have to go?
This is not your time,
Highlander.
Remember... they're both mine.
Now, go!
I won't forget you.
Ah, Nakano.
So good to see you again.
The pleasure is always mine!
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!
Where is the Highlander?
Huh?
You age badly, you old goat.
Aah.
I think this is the Highlander.
There can be only one!
Always in the way, old man, huh?
More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!
Go after the Highlander!
Now!
So.
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?
I didn't give it you
200 years ago.
- I'm not about to now!
- Yes.
But if I cut off your head,
I get your magic anyway.
So... we could do this the easy way... or we could do this... the hard way.
My head doesn't come off that easy.
No? But it does come off, nonetheless.
You betrayed yourself, old man.
There can be... only one.
Yes, only one!
But it will not be you!
Hi, Alex. Good to see you.
Hi, Takamura. How are you?
Fine, thank you.
The archaeological commission is waiting.
The owner of the corporation is threatening... to shut us down so he can continue his foundations.
They can't stop the excavation now.
Japanese government has enormous respect for such a famous archaeologist as yourself, but this is a delicate situation.
Well, from what you sent me to authenticate, definitely 16th century.
But check the grid points.
Do you realize this spot is less than a mile from the center of Niri?
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?
Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.
Oh, which reminds me.
- So's Babe Ruth... based on fact.
- Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex.
The commission.
Highlander's out there somewhere.
And he owes me 400 years.
Find him!
Nothing more!
Just find him.
Where are we?
What's happening?
Nothing really left for you to worry about, my friend.
- There can be only one!
- Kane!
Ahhh.
Dad, is it okay?
Yeah.
I didn't think there could be lightning without clouds.
Let's go.
How can this be happening?
They were all dead and the prize was mine.
So who is out there?
And where is he?
If anything happens to me,
I want you to look after John.
What are you talking about?
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.
Does the boy know you're not his real father?
Oh, yeah. He knew he was adopted before he could spell it.
I hope whatever's taking you is worth what you're leaving.
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.
I know he's alive... and I have to find him.
Going back to New York to the place of the gathering... is not what I had in mind.
Once again, my life was about to change.
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.
Oh, shit.
So what did they take?
- We don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
So this must be the inner chamber.
But how did they know it was here?
Look at this!
What, 1500s?
Remarkable copy.
- Alex.
- I just want a sample.
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.
John.
John.
Hey. I'm not gonna be away long.
Well, you better call me.
Hey.
You better call me.
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.
Come here.
I love you, John.
Get out of the road!
Hey, pendejo. What are ya doin' here?
Stop the car!
Hey, Antonio.
Hey, vamos, carnales.
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.
Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
Little boy lost his way.
Hey, fuckhead,
I'm talkin' to you.
Nice blade.
Gang beating!
Malloy! Here!
- Clear the way! Come on, move!
- Severe trauma.
- Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds, 38 caliber.
- Vital signs?
- Stable.
- Lucky guy.
- Notify the police?
- Of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds.
- Impossible.
- Stop wasting my time!
- This guy was shot!
- You can deal with it.
- Doctor! Malloy!
- Restrain him!
Grab hold of him!
Get me a sedative!
Let me go!
You don't understand!
Let me go!
Take him up to ward seven right away.
- Ward seven?
- You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic.
Well... it's definitely not a fake.
It doesn't make any sense.
Alex-san, how do you explain this?
- Where'd you find it?
- In the chamber.
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern.
- The weave. Certainly not Japanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.
Especially 400 years ago.
Waterloo, my greatest battle. If only
I'd used my left flank before dawn.
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.
Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
Keep it down.
Who are you?
Martin.
Remember?
- Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?
- Yes.
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
- My God, what are you doing here?
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.
I know.
It's not safe here.
Please help me.
Oh, great one.
My mission is not over yet.
What mission?
Wellington. Remember?
I have to kill him.
Nephew, make him suffer.
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!
Finally the time has come and the time is now!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Shut up!
Yeah, man, let's dump this stuff and go.
Highlander!
I am your shadow!
Where is Kane?
Don't worry about Kane.
Worry about me.
You've already lost.
There can be only one.
So what do you got, Vorisek?
We got a body here and we got a head over there.
Now, I suspect foul play.
Maybe you should've taken over for Carson, you're so funny.
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a halloween costume gets his head sliced off.
- It's not your usual humdrum assassination.
- Where's the sword?
- How'd you know about that? I was saving that as a surprise.
- I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.
Hey, Lieutenant, you know, we checked for prints already.
Wasted your time.
You won't find nothin'.
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward, came down and did this hell of a mess.
Russell Nash.
- You see, he's a genius.
- Yeah? So you know the victim?
I know the killer.
Mr. Nash.
Lieutenant John Stenn,
N.Y.P.D.
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm gonna nail you. That's a promise.
Have a good night,
Lieutenant.
Whoop.
Sorry, Charlie.
- Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.
- All right.
- Yo, yo, the brother. The brother.
My brother, come on in, come on in.
Tell you what, you find the red card,
I'll give you $20 now.
Easy as that.
You do my magic.
Boom. You're on.
- I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?
Hey, yo!
Yo, gimme back my money.
My glasses!
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?
Welcome back, MacLeod.
Get back in the car immediately, please! My son...
I have with me American archaeologist,
Dr. Alex Johnson, who's from the New York Museum of Ancient History.
Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about the discovery, and why is it so exciting?
Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional, but only after a much more detailed analysis...
- Sarah.
- Will we be able to speculate as to the identities...
Do I know you?
No.
No. Hmm?
I thought not.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling... that this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.
Ah, Connor MacLeod.
I see you've met my rather spirited niece, Sarah.
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
I invited him for the weekend to join us at the card table.
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.
So am I.
On occasion.
Any chance of a preview?
Not at this point, but some of the more unusual objects... will be lent to our existing exhibition...
However, is it not possible to be stepping on the site... of the legendary lost cave of the great Japanese sorcerer Nakano?
As I've said before, any speculation at this point would be a little premature.
Well, is it not true that supported by your own controversial studies, that legends can be used to identify archaeological sites?
It is true that we have seen parallels between missing sites before.
What about the inscriptions?
Do they offer clues or is this some cave-robbing graffiti?
It's probably just some ancient taggers.
Taggers. Well, Ms. Johnson, so no idea what it means?
I know what it means.
As for the alphabet... uh, early Russian.
"There can be only one. "
Only one what?
Alex-san, another fax from Tommy.
"A little something to read on the flight home.
I thought this might interest you. "
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.
Better document that last crate.
The man wants vinyl when he can have the real thing?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Why don't you come here a little bit and make yourself comfortable?
You nice, big boy.
Come on, you little devil.
Silent type, huh?
It fine by me, baby.
But I'm telling you... no glove... no love.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, baby.
So after three days, this better be good.
Well, it wasn't easy, but I finally determined the cause of death.
All right, now that we've had our little joke, what else you got?
Nothin'.
Besides havin' his head cut off, he's in perfect health.
No broken bones, no cavities, no organ deterioration.
Like a newborn baby.
Find out who he is?
He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothin'.
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?
Mmm. I think you better not smoke in here, Lieutenant.
What's this guy doin' in New York City?
What's he doin' on the planet?
Thanks, Howard!
MacLeods. But I checked it. Same pattern, didn't match up.
Apparently, this alteration in the color... denotes a branch of the clan that broke away in, I think, 1536.
Some incident occurred that year... involving a Connor MacLeod who was driven from his home, accused of wielding powers thought to have been unnatural.
So in defiance, the father altered this insignia to honor the son's lineage, but there's been no record of this branch ever since.
Except for a piece of cloth.
Which could now place one of them in a Japanese cave a few years later.
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?
What if he was one of these
Gaelic mystics?
Nakano's initiates were said to have been great sorcerers, right?
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.
Interesting theory, but,
Alex, no records, no proof.
Once a year, the MacLeods meet at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.
According to the registrar, this entry was made in 1986, some antique dealer claiming to be a direct descendant... of this particular branch.
So where's this guy from?
New York.
They faxed me his address.
What? You're gonna harass some poor guy about his ancestors?
- He's gonna think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.
Then again, at this point, it may be my only link to Nakano.
Well... I'm off.
Bye, Tommy.
I'll tell security you're working late.
Thanks.
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?
This place, here.
What do you call it?
Uh... A museum, but we're closed.
Museum.
Ah, no, please.
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.
I'm a big historian myself really.
Ah, this looks familiar.
Oh, isn't it amazing how the present just can't seem to escape the past?
C- Can I help you with something?
No, no, no. I'm just a...
Just doing a little research.
Ooh, look at this cave.
Little small, eh?
And what does your museum call it?
- A model.
- A model.
And you?
Um, um, a vision of a past reality, I suppose.
Oh, reality.
No, not reality.
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer... illusion or fantasy, a little hocus pocus and maybe a little...
Maybe a little bit of... hanky-panky, huh?
Connor MacLeod.
Don't worry, my prissy,
I'll find him.
I'm gonna find him.
Burn it down.
I'm outside the Japanese
Spiritual Center in Queens.
Hyah!
Ya!
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.
Hyah!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Whooo-oh!
Come on. Come on.
Hyah!
I wish we could go on like this for a thousand years.
What do you wish?
MacLeod?
That he had better timing.
What do you want, Pierre?
I have bad news.
They need you in Paris.
Why now?
The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.
You're not coming back, are you?
You have to get back to England.
- It won't be safe here.
- No one is safe now.
Connor.
Take this.
Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?
- I'm looking for the previous owner of your shop, a Connor MacLeod.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, would you?
Did you follow me?
Yes.
I haven't seen him in eight years.
Do... Do you know if he's still in the area?
I wish I could help you,
Miss Johnson.
How do you know my name?
Well, you're, uh... discovery in Japan has made you famous.
You're obviously... interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.
Strange food.
Good cars.
Tough deals.
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.
Look, Mr. Nash,
I don't mean to bother you, but you're my only link to this Connor MacLeod.
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.
So am I.
Four hundred years... is a long time to hate.
Ohh.
And you never wrote.
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.
Eh, MacLeod?
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.
A little too... pale.
Then again, this being the 90s,
I, I could make an exception, huh?
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane, and we can't fight on holy ground.
Oh, well... I guess
I'll be the judge of that.
Hyah!
Oooh.
Nothing!
There can be only...
One!
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.
Jesus Christ!
I'm goin' in!
Listen!
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Stay away.
Freeze! Police!
One more thing I think you should know about:
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while. Brenda.
Brenda Wyatt.
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by... the murders, the swords... the whole thing.
Lieutenant, it's what,
5:00 in the morning?
They scraped her off a highway in Scotland seven years ago.
She was killed instantly, but he walked away... without a scratch.
Sad for him.
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry. No.
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.
Now I suggest you stay away from him.
That's exactly what he said.
Please, my friend.
For the revolution.
MacLeod!
Visitor!
Calm down, MacLeod.
If you die, we lose a great warrior against evil.
I'm here to take your place.
Go home and sleep it off.
Come on.
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.
Come on, Pierre.
Go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.
When he wakes up, throw him out.
God be with you.
For treason against the King of France.
Connor MacLeod.
Connor! Connor!
Connor!
Oh, Sarah.
Yes?
Well, it was a very interesting evening last night, but I didn't exactly have time to check the phone book... Mr. MacLeod.
You wanna come in?
Come in.
I'll fix you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
You've, uh, got quite a collection.
- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?
This is Janet at Super Travel.
I'm calling to confirm your reservation on the Newark-Glasgow flight.
Your ticket is prepaid and waiting at the counter.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lot of Connors in the family.
Her name was Sarah.
Come on, dear.
Ah, Papa.
Look, I don't know what was going on last night, but I think it's got something to do with what I'm working on.
We found a piece of tartan in the cave that was traced to... an undocumented branch of the MacLeods, of which... you are apparently the only member on record.
That cave was sealed
400 years ago.
Have you ever heard of the legend of the sorcerer Nakano?
Don't you ever think about anything else but business?
Do you have something better to offer?
It seems
I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
Well, I'm sure you'll let me know if something comes to mind, huh?
Hm. What's this?
Looks familiar.
Death to the MacLeods!
My bonny Heather, my first wife, my first love.
I came back here because this is where it all started.
And I need some strength.
God.
Ahh. The last 400 years... have been good to you, MacLeod.
Oh.
Oops-a-daisy.
Hi. Leave a message;
I'll call you back.
Uh, hi, it's me, John.
I miss you.
When are you coming home?
Uh, y-you said you were gonna call me, remember?
Well, in case you forgot, it's Marrakesh 1442.
Love you, Daddy. Bye.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Hey, MacLeod.
I thought you'd find me.
Why did you come?
Nakano.
You seem like you belong here.
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.
You spend a lot of time alone.
I'm used to it.
Nobody is.
You don't let people in, do you?
I can't.
- It hurts. Love and...
- And see them die?
Like the woman in the painting.
Yes.
I loved her very much.
I know who you are.
You're Connor MacLeod.
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glen Finnan, on the shores of Loch Shiel.
You were driven from your home in 1536.
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?
There's a Jack Donovan on the phone returning your call.
I'll be right back.
- Jack.
- What are you doing in Scotland?
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.
He gets into Newark tomorrow afternoon as planned.
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?
I've just dropped him at the airport.
Is there a problem?
No problem, Jack.
I'll pick him up.
Bye, Jack. Thanks.
Passport, please.
You're traveling alone?
Um, yeah, but my dad's picking me up.
Welcome to the United States,
Mr. MacLeod.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What?
- They got Nash.
- Where?
All right, we'll be right there.
Northwest Airlines. Flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.
Come on, move. Let's go!
It's over there.
The green bag. Grab it.
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?
Next.
- Dad!
- John.
- Freeze!
- Let me go!
John!
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche. Get in the car.
Little punk.
Who... Who are you?
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?
There's nothing in your file about a son. You're a a fuckin' liar!
Nash, what son?
Please, stop the car! Please!
Let me outta here!
- "Let me out of here. Please, stop the car. "
- Stop!
Please! Look at the plane!
There's a plane!
No!
Whoo!
I ain't missin' my plane!
Whoa! Whoa!
You take the wheel!
Watch out!
Give it back!
Ohh! Mother!
Okay, guys,
I'll take it from here.
Okay.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.
Whoo!
- Hey! Aaah!
- It's a truck! Stop!
Help!
This is fuckin' bullshit.
Without a confession, we got nothin' on this guy.
So if we can't charge him, he's gonna have to release him.
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?
There goes!
Now, first rule of safety:
Keep your eye on the road!
What's that? It's a wall!
Okay, Nash, you're free to go... for now.
- Oh, yeah. One more thing.
- What?
One day you'll make a mistake, and when you do, I'll nail ya.
I've heard that before.
Let the fucker go.
Your daddy can't save you now.
MacLeod... or Highlander... whatever you're going by these days.
- It's your boy.
- Dad!
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.
I'm at the old mission.
Route 1. Jersey City. Do come.
Dad!
Ah, the importance of teaching young people family values. Hah? Smoke.
- Don't touch him.
- Ha-ha! Little punk.
- Come here, John.
- Go see your father.
Ohh!
Disappearance in the family.
It's funny. You know, I... I thought immortals couldn't have children.
But it seems that while
I'm the master of illusion, you are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.
How did you do it? How did you convince all those lovely women of yours... that they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
When all the while it was you and your little immortal pecker... that really didn't do the pecking.
Ohh. I know.
You must've been very disappointed.
All those nice years thinking you were the only one left.
But, you see, the prize was never yours.
And now, it never will be.
Amen.
Nice little speech, Kane, but it's not gonna save your head.
Where's John?
Oh. Well, come with me.
Come. Where's Johnny?
Here's Johnny.
Ahh.
Ooh.
MacLeod.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
I... I just thought
I could help.
Aah!
Aw, shit!
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Ooh, MacLeod.
You're such a lady-killer.
I can't kill an unarmed man.
Take it.
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?
I'll see you... in hell.
I'll be the judge of that.
There can be only one.
Dad?
Dad?
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
Will ya do somethin' for me, Connor?
In the years to come, will ya light a candle and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love. I will.
There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.
The glen is snowy and cold.
It's the most glorious sight on Earth.
I've found no place to match it in 400 years.
I'm back now... with a woman I love and a son I've taken as my own.
I'm at peace.
It's finally over.
âHello?
âIt's me.
Oh, am I bothering you, Francesco?
No, don't worry, I had to get out of the shower some time.
Hold on a minute, Francoâ¦
You were saying, Franco?
No, no, nothing. Just calling to see how you doing.
You know how things areâ¦
â¦life goes on.
Gnaghi!
I've been shouting at you for hours. Gnaghi!
He's Ghigini, the surveyor.
12th row, 3rd grave, right?
âGna.
Grave three.
Here we go.
I know you've heard this before, but this time, my dear Ghigini, it is forever.
Rest in peace!
Oh, my backâ¦
What a waste of good marble.
Never looks right when you fix it.
All this fancy packaging.
I don' know why they don't just cover the graves with dirt.
The gun! I forgot the fucking gun!
âEaâ¦ t!
âGnaghi, give me the spade! Gnaghi! give me the fucking spade!
There we go.
You handle the rest, Gnaghi.
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.
Weird name, isn't it?
Francis Of Death.
Saint Francis Of Death.
I often thought of having it changed.
Andrea Dellamorte would be nicer, for example.
I'm the watchman of the Buffalora cemetery,
I don't know how the epidemic started,
All I know is that some people, on the 7th night after their death
come back to life.
I call them âReturnersâ,
but frankly I can't understand why they're so anxious to return.
The only way to get rid of them once and for all,
is to split their heads open.
A spade'll do it, but a
Dum-Dum bullet is best.
Come and have a glass of wine.
Is this the beginning of an invasion?
Does it happen in all cemeteries,
or is Buffalora just an exception?
Who knows? And in the end, who cares?
I'm just doing my job.
Good morning, engineer.
How are you doing today?
Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?
The cemetery is open, isn't it?
For you, any time.
Hello, cutie. Hereâ¦
How are you?
He's happy. He likes it when the sun shines.
I'm not an engineerâ¦
â¦and you are no cutie.
Poor Gnaghi, on his ID card it reads:
âDistinctive physical marks: allâ.
He has a real passion for dead leaves,
can't stand it when the wind blows them awayâ¦
Oh well,
we all do what we can not to think about life.
The most beautiful living woman I have ever seen!
Will I see her again?
I just came to water the flowers on your poor father's grave.
Husband.
How long has he been dead?
Two weeks.
âThank goodness.
âWhat?
âI mean, I'm very sorry.
âHave you no respect for pain?
Well, you know how these things areâ¦ You see: in time, pain heals.
âIt's not healing a bit.
He was wonderful, he was a wonderful lover, incredible, tireless.
He was fantastic!
I messed it all up,
I've lost her.
Will I see her again?
Hey, Franco!
Franco is the only living person
who even calls me. Now and then I stop by his office
to remind myself what he looks like.
You can't live on memories alone.
It's for you. Sign as usual.
âHave you got a pen?
âNo.
Hold on a sec, here we are.
Have you had any visits last nights?
A couple, yes.
All this extra work! It's much if the pay me any more.
Tell the Mayorâ¦
Oh, tell the Mayor then what?
They'd close the cemetery.
Good-bye job and good-bye house!
Come on, who do you think would believe you?
Listen, I don't care if you don't believe me, Franco, you're not the one who pays me!
I believe you,
I believe you, and you're rightâ¦
At least have him pay the overtime.
âGood.
Well, let's go to the Mayor, then!
It's not that easy.
First you have to fill out an M3 form, report with an M3 formâ¦
Formsâ¦
I could speed things up there for youâ¦
It's easier just to shoot them.
One M3 form!
Going to get our willies wet tonight?
Some of us, yeah.
Hell, at a certain point in life, you realize
you know more dead people than living.
Sorry about the other day, I was a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.
You know, this is the only job I could get even with a degree in biology.
Anyway we all end up here sooner or later, don't we?
I've got a great little houseâ¦ Want to see it?
I don't live alone, I've got a helper, Gnaghi.
He's a real conversationist!
The cemetery's small, but it's got a marvellous ossuary!
An ossuaryâ¦
I have never seen anything soâ¦ exciting!
Neither have I.
It's like in my dreams!
This is my dream.
I couldn't ask for anything more.
Me neither.
You know, you've got a real nice ossuary.
Thanks.
You will allow me to return, won't you?
You will allow me to kiss you just once, won't you?
No.
Not like this.
Like this.
I must be faithful to the memory of my husband!
I can't. I can't!
It's not my faultâ¦ It's this place.
I feel strange tremors.
It's not the coldâ¦
I'm not afraidâ¦
This place wants me toâ¦
It's forcing me toâ¦
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
I can't! I can't!
Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.
Why here?
Why on your poor husband's grave?
I've never kept anything from himâ¦
We trusted each other implicitly.
He would have liked to know.
Well, if that's the caseâ¦
All these lights!
Let them watch.
What's better than watching two lovers making love, hey?
Just to have a bit of privacy.
Sorry, but the lady wants stars only.
It's never been like this before, with anybody.
Only you.
No one will ever make us part.
Gnaghi! The gun!
I can explain! Listen to me, you've always been so understanding!
That's life!
It's nothing my love, you're fine.
Great, just when I don't need it anymore.
Well don't just stand there!
Go call doctor Vercesi!
Go on, get the doctor!
Go on! Move!
Nothing can separate us.
I swear, nothing.
Nothing will separate us, will it?
Nothing, my love. Nothing.
Not even death?
Not even death.
Dellamorte, are you in there? Dellamorte!
Jesus! You scared me to death!
Were you looking for me, Chief Straniero?
Yes, Dr Vercesi called.
What happened last night?
Well you know. Why are you asking me? She's dead.
I know she's dead, but how did that happen?
Her husband.
Sure! He came back from the dead, he raped her, then bit her to death.
Is that what he did?
No, he didn't rape her.
Oh, you always crack me up, you know!
Dr Vercesi, are you spying on us?
No, I dropped this certificate.
Her heart stopped from fear, it wasn't the bite that killed her.
She died while makingâ¦ well you knowâ¦ doing it.
You know what that means, my boy?
I'll have to look somewhere else for the creep who killed her!
You are no longer a suspect.
âWhy not?
Well, you know what I mean.
Look, don't make me say it!
Go on, you can say it. I don't mind, I'm impotent!
Don't use that word! A young man like you, at your ageâ¦
Did she have any relatives?
No, no relatives, no friends.
Well, I have to say thatâ¦
Shit! This is definitely not my style!
âCan I keep her here?
âIf you pay for the funeral, of course you can do whatever the hell you want with her.
âDoes that wrap it up, then?
âYeah, except for a killer on the loose.
Care to join me for a cup of tea?
The weather's changing at last!
I can't forgive myself for having lied to you:
I don't have a degree in biology,
I didn't even finish high school.
I haven't read more than two books in my whole life: one, never finished, and the other is the phone book.
I don't want her to become a Returner.
I don't want to see her again.
No!
Yes, my love!
No, don't make me do it!
But if you do it so wellâ¦ so well!
Not to you!
It will be better with me than with the others!
Gna!
You do it!
Well go on! If you finish fast I'll buy you an ice-cream.
Gna!
âHere comes the Unforgiven.
âWho?
The Tombstone Mayor.
The man whose dick's so small he pees with tweezers.
He could become a woman. That'd solve it!
They are sewing them back on in the States now.
Yeah, they can stitch it right on, if you've got one to start with.
Forget it, I started that rumour.
The more they laugh, the further away they seem.
You can never be too different, Gnaghi.
Maybe you can.
Engineer!
Engineer, engineer, come!
Have a seat!
Well well well, what a surprise!
Yes! It's a miracle seeing you here, engineer!
It's a miracle seeing you here, Mr Mayor.
So, how are things down at our cemetery? How are things?
Well how do you think things are?
Population's shrinking.
You're lucky, my dear engineer!
You just can't imagine how things are at the Town Hall.
Now that the elections are upon us, it is chaos, right, inspector?
Yeah, it's a thrill for all, nobody wants to lose their job.
I was hoping for a New Dealâ¦
Daddy, what's this?
This is my assistant Gnaghi.
He's sweet!
Will you buy him, daddy?
That's great, it even knows how to cry!
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.
Could you move over, darling?
Would you tell your daughter to move over please?
Yes of course.
Sometimes Gnaghi gets a little bit excitedâ¦
Oh, I'm sure he's charming.
Now, where was I?
What's he doing? Dancing?
No, no, he's just about toâ¦
What the hell are you doing, Valentina?
He threw up on me, Claudio!
Oh, a new fan!
Would you like to go for a ride?
I knew you'd understand!
Take off!
By the way, one of these days
I have to talk to you about the cemetery.
The youth of todayâ¦
They're soâ¦ emotional.
Come on, Gnaghi!
Get in, for God's sake!
Don't do this, just get in the car!
It's not the end of the world,
It didn't even bother her!
She understood it was just a demonstration of your affection.
Anyway, it's not the first time you threw up over a woman, is it?
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!
Look, first love doesn't count.
It's last love that counts!
Nobody came today.
I was a bit bored, not even the admiralâ¦ he's just disappeared!
Let's hope tomorrow, okay?
Yeah, come again and stay a while.
Oh, he was such a distinguished man, the admiral!
Always used to bring me, always, a touch of Sambuca.
Oh, come on, Gnaghi!
You'll get over, you'll see!
Time passes, nothing seems the sameâ¦
It just gets worse.
God, is it ever difficult trying to make you feel better!
What were you doing with the Mayor's daughter anyway? She's only a child!
Gna!
Oh yeah, that's not true, you are not a child, Gnaghi.
You're a year older than I am. Anywayâ¦
One day, you'll settle down with someâ¦ poor creature like yourself.
In the meanwhile, why do you care?
They all end up here sooner or later, Gnaghi.
Often sooner than later.
Faster, open it up!
âIf daddy could see us now!
âHe'd kill me!
Claudio!
âOff we go!
âGo!
Go! Go!
Go!
âHang on!
âEat our dust!
Four motorcycles racingâ¦
The Mayor's daughter is on one of them.
Her head was sliced right off.
They had to sew it back on the body.
The bikes crashed into a bus loaded with scouts on their way back from a church-sponsored rally.
Slaughter of the innocents!
And they were all so young.
They felt their life was ahead of them, but in fact they were already passing by.
Well, you've got your hands full!
Oh, more than you know!
Gnaghi, we're going to need a lot of bullets.
â« Never should have gone out on the Boy Scout picnic,
â« never should have, never should have gone just then.
â« Never should have gone out on the Boy Scout picnic,
â« Never should have, now
I'll never go again! â«
Claudio! Take me with you!
Don't leave me all alone, Claudio!
Take me with you, my love!
Oh no, sweetheart!
My son wasn't with you!
He was promised to the Mayor's daughter!
âBut he loved me!
âLiar!
He was mine, he loved me!
Only me!
âHave you no respect for a mother's pain?
We're born to die, born merely to die.
Do you remember?
Just yesterday, she was alive, happy.
Do you remember?
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her, and she took it so well!
And now, she's goneâ¦ and right on the eve of the elections!
I better get the pickaxe and shovel.
Pumpkin, how could you do this to me?
Is it true as they say, that the dead come back to life here at night?
Tell me the truth!
Hey! Who told you that?
Is it true or not? Is it true or not?
What if it is?
I've got to see Claudio again!
I have to know whether he loved me or her!
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.
No, waitâ¦
Go away! I haven't got time for the living!
Gnaghi?
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi, they came back sooner than we thought!
Gnaghi wake up!
Gnaghi, watch out!
Gnaghi,
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
Well, that's it, time's up and
I want you upstairs and ready in five minutes! Okay?
Oh no, what's she doing here?
Visiting hours are over!
No one is going to take me away from him!
Quick, get the fuck over here! Quick!
Noâ¦ Claudio!
Claudio, take me with you! Don't leave me!
Stupid cow!
Come on!
Wait! Wait!
Claudio please, take me with you!
Tell me you only love me!
Pleaseâ¦
Claudio!
You only love me, right?
Damn! It always shoots to the right when it's cold.
Gnaghi!
No, please don't!
He's only eating me!
Move aside.
Mind your business! I shall be eaten by whoever I please!
This is my business.
They pay me for it.
The living dead
and the dying living are all the same.
Cut from the same cloth.
But disposing of dead people is a public service,
whereas you're in all sorts of trouble
if you kill someone while they're still alive.
Wait!
This way they'll be together forever.
I'm sentimental.
Patience, Gnaghi.
In love, it's the waiting that's the best part.
You have to learn how to wait.
âWhat's your name again?
âGna!
Gnaghi.
I'm Valentina.
Haven't I seen you before?
Oh yeah. Now I remember.
You threw up on me. How sweet!
But I like shy boys, and you never say no to a kiss.
Take advantage.
I'm certainly in no position to refuse. Besides,
I don't think I'd refuse anyway.
False alarm!
It was only a cat.
No use you trying to help me, little thing!
If I can't do it, imagine youâ¦
Putting this skull together, is one of the most difficult things in the world.
Gna!
You know, you really are disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi.
Yes, you're right. I suppose it all does get mixed up in the stomach, in the end.
What is it?
That wasn't a cat!
We can't! I'm alive, and you are dead.
I'm not prejudiced, my love.
I killed her!
Gna!
I killed her!
I killed her.
The first time, when her husband bit her, she wasn't really dead.
When she woke up, and I shot her, she was alive.
I killed her.
I killed the only woman I ever loved.
I shot her with my eyes closed,
didn't aim for the head.
That's why she came back.
God, what an idiot!
Now, I'm infected too.
Will I be a Returner when I die?
Who knows if Gnaghiâ¦
No, poor Gnaghi, he'd never have the guts
to crush my skull with a shovel.
I'm not dead, you idiot!
A bite can't kill you!
Good morning, engineer!
Miss Chiaromondo,
I'm not an engineer.
Are you, or are you not the watchman of the cemetery?
Well, of course I am.
You are therefore an engineer.
By the way, which of these do you think would be better on my tombstone?
Both.
I like the opinion of a handsome young man.
Good-bye, engineer.
âGna!
âGood morning, cutie.
But that's the phone book.
Are you crazy?
That is my favourite reading!
Gnaghi, just because we've got the new ones doesn't mean to say we have to throw the old ones away. These books are classics!
Gnaghi!
Gna!
Stop killing the dead.
They're mine.
If you don't want the dead coming back to lifeâ¦
why don't you just kill the living,
shoot them in the head?
Are you listening to me?
âHello?
âGreetings from the Tomb of the Town Hall.
âFranco! How are you?
âBored.
Am I disturbing you?
No, you never disturb me.
Just called to talk about the scandal.
âGnaghi, the door!
ââ¦all that crap.
What did you say?
What the hell was that?
Nothing, I'mâ¦
â¦just working.
âWhat?
You know, daily grind.
Nothing but the daily grind.
You're telling me! Sometimes,
I feel like shooting myself.
How's everything in your life?
How are dear Mara and Cinzia?
You know, sometimes I wonder if they really exist, Franco.
I mean, you do have a wife and a daughter, don't you?
I only ask 'causeâ¦ sometimes
I think you've made it all up.
Franco, you do make me laugh!
You'll get out one day.
Buffalora will be nothing but a bad, bad memory.
Yeah, or maybe not, if only I could get unstuckâ¦
I feel like a fly on fly paper.
You'll see, Francoâ¦
Mara is going to get tired of you, and Cinzia will grow up to hate you.
Then you'll be free.
Free to see what the rest of the world looks like.
What do you think the rest of the world looks like?
âThe rest of the world?
âUh-uh.
Who knows if the rest of the world even existsâ¦
Look who it is!
Hey, Dellamorte, come here!
At times, I get ahead of my work.
Work!
Dellamorte!
Dellamorte!
Gnaghi!
Francesco Dellamorte?
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 last night?
In bed.
Any witnesses?
I was talking to my friend Franco on the telephone and I fell asleep.
Why, what happened?
Some fucking maniac killed 7 people in town.
More work.
Well, you got to go to jail, unless you have an alibi!
Why me?
Because your car was seen driving around the streets last night, that's why.
That's impossible, no one can drive that wreck apart from me.
Actually, I don't think it was you.
I think it was your assistant.
Gnaghi can't even roller-skate!
Neither can I, so what?
I want to question him immediately.
God, the weather's gone bad.
Please, let me talk to him first.
Just tell him to come right out, will you?
Don't you ever clean that place? Jesus Christ, it stinks!
â« When all is sad, when you're alone, it feels so bad.
â« You wait again for love to start, to feel the beating of the heart. â«
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi, I had a terrible dream last night,
I dreamt I went to town and killed 7 real people.
Hi, remember me?
Dellamorte, you've got important visitors!
You'll understand, engineer, after this massacre, the voters are furious with me.
They've been voting for you for 15 years.
If I don't find this maniac, Straniero, there won't be a sixteenth.
What's your daughter got to do with it?
Now that the whole town is in mourning,
I want to show them that I'm grieving as well.
I'll have some pictures taken of the body and put a blow-up on my election posters.
And underneath, something like:
âif you've had a death in the family, vote for someone who suffers like you.â
What do you think?
Well, you know, it's a thought!
Or: âVote for a man who has lost all other happiness.â
Ready to shoot?
So what do I do? Take one from the neck down?
Engineer?
What's the meaning of this?
Daddy!
Daddykin!
Did you hear that?
I don't know. It dependsâ¦
Daddypie!
Daddypooh!
Valentina!
Pumpkin!
The plot thickens!
Pumpkin, where are you?
Where are you?
Your Daddy's here!
Where are you?
Stop blabbering and come on in!
Coming.
Here I am, little one.
Jesus, it stinks in here!
It's my fault, daddy!
Oh my God, Valentina!
What are you doing on TV?
I'm rotting fast, Daddy!
You, stuttering monster, you're the one who hurt my little girl!
No, he loves me!
Step aside!
I command you, as your Mayor!
With your consent, I'd like to marry Gnaghi.
âThis horrible thing?
âGna!
I'm not such a great catch either, Daddy.
Not as long, dear, as I've got a breath in my body!
Alright. We'll fix that right away!
Help me, engineer!
I'm not an engineer!
I'm sorry, Gnaghi, she really was beginning toâ¦ go off a bit on that, wasn't she?
He's dead?
He's dead.
Who took a bite out of his neck?
Well, not me or Gnaghi,
Take a mould of our teeth.
You'll see they won't match.
And who did it?
Oh, relax, Straniero. This won't be your first unsolved case, will it?
Hold it!
Oh, come on, Gnaghiâ¦
The world's full of girls like that, and they've got bodies, too.
By the way, do you know what my mother's maiden name was?
You'd never believe it if I told you.
She was called Dellamore.
Dellamore.
That means âloveââ¦
You're not the only person in the world who's lost a lover, Gnaghi.
Get down!
What do you think?
Get down from there!
Forget it, engineer!
Go home!
You're supposed to be setting a good example, now will you get back to your coffin immediately!
You can't stop me, you owe your job to me.
Remember?
âGet down or I'll shoot.
You can't.
I'm the Mayor!
Ex!
âMr Dellamorte?
âWhat?
I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.
Why the barbed wire?
Do they climb in at night?
No, they climb out, sometimes.
Would you mind coming down?
You reported an epidemic which affects the dead.
You claim they come to life within seven days of burial.
It says so, right here.
âAn M3 report.
âDidn't you fill it out?
âNo.
Oh, splendid.
So you'll provide us with a denial.
Just sign here.
Franco must have sent it.
What a nice thought.
Nothing happened.
Nothing ever happens.
If the press got hold of something like this, not only would Buffalora be a laughing stock, but you'd lose your job.
My personal secretary.
Mr Dellamorte.
âA pleasure.
A real pleasure, Mr Dellamorte.
Thank you.
You and I are going to get along just fine.
Good-bye.
Your name!
I didn't get your nameâ¦
Will I see her again?
Hi!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you, Miss.
I was expecting someone else.
Miss! Miss!
Ever since I got to Buffalora, strange things have been happening to me.
It's as if I've been here before.
And that graveâ¦
And you, Mr Dellamorte, it's as if
I've known you forever.
As if I've loved you forever!
You love me, too?
Why?
Who else is there?
I love you as well.
I love you.
I've heard what they say about you in town.
Is it true that you don'tâ¦
I mean, that you can'tâ¦
No, you don't wanna believe town gossip.
Because I can only love an impotent man.
Yeah, it's true. It's true.
I like menâ¦ but their manhood terrifies me.
I can't stand the thought of them having aâ¦
I meanâ¦ you understand?
It's a sort of phobia I have.
I don't have one, I don't have anything at all.
Will you marry me?
I'm getting married!
Gna!
I'm really getting married!
Don't pretend you didn't hear everything.
Gna!
Yeah? Why not?
Go ahead, explainâ¦
God graciousâ¦
What are you saying?
You heard me!
My dear boy, you must be very run down.
I'm going to give you some pills.
Dr Vercesi, I'm serious.
Look, I'm not going to be intimidated in my own surgery.
That waiting room there is full of people with good, honest diseases.
I'll pay youâ¦
Yes I know, butâ¦
How can I? I mean, everybody knows thatâ¦ you haven't got one.
I see. You have got one.
When would you like me to relieve you of yourâ¦ problem?
âNow.
What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Now what?
I told you I don't want an anaesthetic.
It's not an anaesthetic.
What is it, then?
One shot of this, it'll be as if you've never had one.
It lasts for over a month.
Lookâ¦ please don't make me cut it away.
Today I'm just not up to it.
What are you doing, turning over?
I have to give you the shot in the front.
Front where?
Hold still, I'll just make a puncture.
That fucking butcherâ¦ has given me some kind of infection.
Gnaghi!
I'm hovering between life and death.
Gna!
Yeah, you're right.
I suppose I'm used to this condition.
That's her. Don't let her in. Tell her I'm not here.
I don't want her to see me like this.
âI must see Mr Dellamorte.
âGna!
Please, I've got to speak to him, is he in there?
I'd give my life to be dead.
Gnaghi!
It doesn't hurt anymore.
I think I'm better.
Gna!
When did t happen?
She was our nicest client.
The best always die first.
Gna!
Where have you been?
I thought I'd go mad.
If you only knew what happened to me.
If you only knew what happened to meâ¦
I must talk to you.
We'll always be together.
Yes, my love, yes.
I don't know how to say this, but the Mayor raped me.
âNo!
Wait! I liked it.
Not the violence, no.
But after that, we did it again nicely, so that I'd forgive him.
It was wonderful, do you understand?
That means I'm cured. I don't have a phobia anymore.
I can't marry you, now.
I'm going to marry him.
That doesn't mean anything though, I mean, nothing's changed between us, I still love you.
You know that.
I just love you in a different way, but you're important to me.
He knows, I mean, about you and me.
He's a wonderful man, he said he's happy we can be friends.
We can still see each other.
Nothing's changed.
Everything's just as it was.
Everything.
You look for Death in the clear night,
you tell her you still love her,
that you are her slave,
that she's still your queen.
Death, Death,
Death, the whore.
No, I'd only do it for the fear
and I'd come back
just to experience the same fear again.
To be afraid,
always to be afraid.
Hi!
Is that white VW outside yours?
We're on foot.
Could you give us a lift?
It's not very far.
Go on!
I'm Magda.
And this is Laura.
How far is it?
This is where we live, with another girlfriend.
Do you want to come up for a drink?
Come on, you're not afraid of two college girls, are you?
Make a wish. I grant wishes.
I want you to fall in love with me.
But I'm already in love with you.
Haven't you noticed?
It's cold in here.
If you'd like to wash, there's a sink there.
I didn't mean your face, silly!
I don't know whether I can do it.
I've been taking some medicationâ¦
I don't think your medication is working!
Do you love me?
Yes, if you stay all night.
All my life, too.
âCome on!
âLet's rest a bit.
âWhy?
âYou've come three times already.
Twice. The third one was faked.
She's sleeping, she's been studying all day. she's got an exam tomorrow morning.
I just wanted to get some wine.
Sit down.
I'll get you some.
Did Laura tell you you can pay me?
Pay you?
School's expensive, my friend.
I have to pay you?
We don't have a scholarship, you know.
Besides, it's only 100,000 lira.
She told me she loved meâ¦
That's 150,000.
She wants me to stay the night.
Is a cheque all right?
It's money, isn't it?
Hurry, darling.
I'm cold.
Come and warm me up.
I need your warmth.
Warm me up.
Coming, love.
Now you'll be warm forever.
This time I'm really through with love.
I bet you'd like to know where I was between 1 and 3 last night, wouldn't you?
I know, I know.
Here we are. Have no fear,
I won't tell anybody about this cheque, this is the reason I came here.
We're both worldly men, aren't we?
âBut this could be proof againstâ
âProof against whom?
We've already arrested the guilty party.
After setting fire to the apartment, he went home, killed his wife and daughter, then turned himself in. He's at the hospital, the psychiatric ward.
Somebody's stolen my crimes!
Sir?
Excuse me, this section is closed to the public.
I've come to see the killer.
But you can't go in there. He's in a coma.
He drank a whole bottle of iodine.
I have to take his measurements.
Franco!
You looked a lot better the last time we talked on the phone.
Thief!
You're a thiefâ¦
You may have killed your wife and daughter, OK, I'll give you that, but it was me who knocked off the three girls.
What are you doing stealing my murders?
What kind of fucking friend do you think you are?
Especially as you thought you were doing me a favour.
Put that out immediately!
Smoking is not allowed in here!
âShut up!
He's in a coma.
He doesn't even notice.
Shitâ¦
What'd you say?
Everything's shitâ¦
The only thing that's not shittyâ¦ is sleep.
What are you doing on the floor, sister?
She's praying.
Friend of yours?
Look, he hasn't got any relatives and the coma he's in is irreversible.
Give me a signature and I'll pull the plug now.
âFuck off!
Here we go. Put it back in there.
I won't let you die until you give me an explanation.
Why did you steal my murders?
Don't you think anything
I do counts? Huh?
Oh, my God! What happened?
They killed each other. It was a settling of scores.
Don't you believe me?
âNo!
âTough.
So badâ¦
So, is that all you have any need to say to your only friend?
Who are you?â¦
I don't know youâ¦
I don't know who you are.
Go away.
Go away!
Dellamorte, wait.
For God's sake, wait! There's another maniac on the loose.
He's on the 4th floor killing people.
He already shot three.
You got a gun!
That's good.
Now you can defend yourself.
Hey, take my advice and get the hell out of here quick!
Straniero!
It was me!
You and I are both the same.
We kill out of indifference, out of love sometimes, but never out of hate.
Now I don't know who's dead or alive.
I'm sick of killing.
So I'm leaving the game, brother.
Dellamorte Dellamoreâ¦ bids you farewellâ¦ and is on his way.
Where to?
Better get out of here.
Even the statue's talking.
Where do you think you're going?
if you haven't yet understood the difference
between life and me?
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that!
That coffin is not coming with us!
Yeah, I missed that one. Don't worry, I'll get the next one.
Oh, calm down. I know every bump on this road.
There's one!
Look!
I'd never been this far.
We made it, Gnaghi!
Who could have imagined this?
Wider than all the streets of Buffalora put together.
âIt never seems to end!
âGna!
Hang on, Gnaghi.
Past this tunnel is the rest of the world.
What do you think the rest of the world looks like, Gnaghi?
Can you imagine it?
You're right. It's beyond imagination.
I should have known it.
The rest of the world doesn't exist.
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi, you weren't hit that hard. Come on.
Come on, I'll take you to the car. Come on,
Come on! Why are you going on like this? You've just got cut.
Come on man, get up,
I'll take you to the car!
Come on! Come on, get up!
What? What?
Gnaghi!
Gnaghi!
Don't leave me alone now. Gnaghi! Gnaghi!
Oh God!
Death,
death, death comes sweeping down,
filthy death the leering clown,
death on wings, death by surprise,
veiling evil from worldly eyes,
death that's born
as life succumbs, while death and love
two kindred drums, beat the time
till Judgement Day,
an actor
in a Passion Play,
without beginning, without end,
evermore.
Amen.
You were my best friend.
I didn't even realise it.
Could you take me home?
Please.
Gna.
That fair her seems...
That fair her seems the less ye see her may.
Lo see soon after how...
Modesty.
There are things that she'll see.
Lo see soon after how... more bold and free her bared bosom...
A see the virgin rose...
How sweetly she...
...doth peep forth with bashful modesty.
There can be no doubt about his sex.
Despite the feminine appearance that...
...every young man at the time aspires to.
And there can be no doubt about his upbringing.
Good food.
Education.
A nanny.
Loneliness and isolation.
And...because this is England...
Orlando would therefore seem destined...
...to have his portrait on the wall.
And his name in the history books.
But when he...
That is...
I
Came into the world.
He was looking for something else.
Though heir to a name that meant power, land and property...
Surely when Orlando was born...
...it wasn't privilege he sought...
...but company.
âª Eliza âª...
...âª Eliza's eyes are blessed stars, âª...

More wine my lord?
A see the virgin rose.
How sweetly she doth first peep forth
With bashful modesty.
That fair her seems the less ye see her may.
Lo see soon after how.. more bold and free her bared bosom she doth broad display
Lo see soon after how she fades...
...and falls away. so passeth in th..
Is this a worthy topic?
From one so clearly in the bloom of youth.
To one who would desire it still?
Fair virgo gratious majesty,
Your bloom is legendary, and these were of course not the sentiments of our son, but of a poet.
Now what would please you?
All that is mine is here for your pleasure.
All you call yours is mine already.
Come.
Your leg.
I want you here in England with me.
You will be the son of my old age...
...and the limb of my infirmity.
My favourite.
My mascot.
Come.
Aah, this is my victory.
Come, your handsome leg.
For you and for your heirs Orlando.
The house.
Your Majesty.
I'm forever i...
But on one condition.
Do not fade.
Do not wither.
Do not grow old.
Very interesting person.
First the queen and now his father.
It is too sad.
Mourning so becomes him.
One can quite see why he was the favourite.
My dear friends how can you?
In his time of grief.
That way.
Sasha.
Who's that?
I believe she is the daughter of the muscovite ambassador.
How the delightful.
If that's to your taste.
What ever can you mean?
Oh, smearing themselves with candle wax to keep warm.
Wearing beards as they get older, that kind of thing.
Perhaps in this you're mistaken, Moray.
Told me on good authority by Lord Francis Vere.
Does he travel to muscovite.
He knows someone who did.
Aah.
This is the Lady Euphrosyne.
The Lord Winchelsea.
The Lord Orlando.
The Earl of Moray.
Moray....
And I am Lord Francis Vere.
Ochin Liesna.
Sorry?
- EnchantÃ©.
Enchanted.
- Aah.
And my name is
Alexandra Menchikova.
But my father calls me Sasha.
EnchantÃ©.
Here doing some quail.
Spasiba.
Do they have quail in Russia?
Do you speak French?
A little.
But the most Englishmen can't, or do...
...not want to speak other languages.
How do they communicate with strangers then?
They speak English louder.
Please tell the ambassador that this, great frost is the most severe ever to have visited these islands.
Erh, tell him that in
Norfolk a young country...
...woman was seen to turn visibly to powder...
...and was blown away in a puff of dust in the icy blast.
Most amusing.
Don't worry my dear, this absurd affection will not last the season.
After all..
She's a foreigner.
My Lord Orlando, you're in danger of becoming a fool.
You're ruining what could be the finest...
...career in the land and for what?
I no longer care for a career, Moray.
I'm only interested in love.
Don't you see in courting a Cossack, you're...
...humiliating not only your fiancÃ©...
...but the entire female population of this country.
Besides which, they have nothing.
Why do you think they're here?
For your sake I would hunt wolf instead of...
...rabbit drinking vodka instead of whiskey.
How generous.
As for marriage to the good
Lady Euphrosyne the thing is...
...so probably absurd that I scarcely give it a thought.
How gallant.
I feel as if I've been hooked through the nose and rushed...
...through the waters painfully yet with my own consent.
How brave.
My Lord, have you quite forgotten that we are betrothed?
My Lady, I'm being constantly reminded.
You speak so lightly of it.
You've betrayed me.
The treachery of men.
It would never have worked.
A man must follow his heart.
There.
Where you live?
I do.
By yourself?
Well, yes.
At the moment.
No brother?
No sister?
You Sasha?
If I had brother I wouldn't be here.
My father only has me.
Nothing thicker than a knifes blade...
...separates melancholy from happiness.
Why are you sad?
Because.
Because I can't bear this happiness to end.
But we are together.
Yes, now.
But what about tomorrow?
And the day after?
Orlando.
I think you suffer from a strange melancholy.
Which is, you suffer in advance.
Look at me. Look.
You are too serious, Orlando.
And yet not serious enough.
Shadows, you saw shadows.
- You were in his arms.
It was illusion in light.
- Then what were you doing?
He was taking me across deck.
- But I saw you.
May gods destroy me, if I family
Menchikov would lie in arm of sailor.
Sasha.
I cannot think of a life without you.
Stay with me.
Don't ever go.
- But it's impossible.
But why?
Because when ice breaks we must go.
But we're linked.
Our destinies are linked.
You're mine.
Why?
Because I adore you.
Meet me at midnight at London bridge.
We'll fly away as free as birds.
Lots of air, very fresh.
There.
It's decided. your lessons, speak now his now his a lot with peace within
Speak of me as I am.
Nothing extenuates nor sits down aught in malice.
Then speak of one.
Who loved lord wisely but to well
But one whom not easily jealous
But being wrought, perplexed in the extreme
Of one whose hand, like the base Indian...
...threw a pearl away. worth more than all his tribe.
I kissed thee ear. I killed thee.
No way but this.
By killing myself...
To die upon a kiss.
Terrific play.
She will. She will be here.
Help. Help.
The treachery of women.
Ehm, ehm.
Ehm.
Good morning.
It's now time to awake.
To such a fine morning.
From such a long refreshing sleep.
Six days you say?
- Tomorrow will be the seventh.
âª This pleasing shining wondrous day. âª
The Lord Orlando...
...is sleeping.
I can find only three words to describe the female sex.
None of which are worth expressing.
When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes.
I all alone be weep my outcast state. and trouble heaven...
...with my bootless cries. and look upon myself...
...and curse my fate.
Aah.
Poetry.
Get off.
Get off.
Off. Off.
Thank you.
I was thinking.
Sitting here, as we are.
It's odd. Considering how common the name of Greene is, that the Greene family came over with the conquerer.
And is in fact, from the highest nobility in France.
Oh.
Oh, really?
Unfortunately the Greens came down in the world and erm..
We've little more than leave our name to the burrower of Greenwich.
And now Mr Greene to the subject closer to my heart and yours.
The sacred subject of poetry.
Aah.
You know, I once broke a lady's fan in my enthusiasm to find a rime.
Enthusiasm can be dangerous.
As a youth I was often mocked for my love of poetry and solitude.
Tragic.
And of course Mr
Greene, your works...
...hold pride of place in my library.
Uh-uh.
To me there is a certain glory about...
...a man who can express in words...
...those great emotions that others can only feel.
Oh.
You know I scarcely dared to ask to make your acquaintance...
...for I feel that I can offer nothing in return.
I'm sure that any writer would be more...
...than willing to except your hospitality.
Oh, do you think so?
If we would speak of poetry...
...then let us first speak of poets lives.
Do you know how
'Hamlet' was written?
Written while bailiffs were pounding on Shakespeare's door.
No wonder so many of his plays were falsey too.
Aw, I'm sure you're right.
How can a...How can a genius work when he cannot pay the bills?
When I say work...
Erm, work you see... is...
...people who haven't laboured in this way don't understand...
...that real poetry neither easy nor easily produced.
Then I feel that I can understand a little Mr Greene.
Because I have myself been so righteous...
...to attempt to write some poems...
Did I hear a mouse's squeak?
I must say I didn't hear any.
That's saying you're in good health.
My own my lord have been so bad it's a marvel I'm still alive.
I have an enlarged heart, a spleen and a diseased liver.
Above all there are sensations in my spine which defy description.
There is one nob about a third from the top which burns like fire.
Second from the bottom...cold as ice.
Sometimes I feel as if a thousand wax tapers were alight.
And people were throwing fireworks inside my brain and I...
I'm so sensitive.
I can feel a rose leaf through my mattress.
In short.
I'm a piece of machinery so finely made...
...and curiously put together...
...that it confounds me to think
That I've only sold
115 copies of my poem.
But it has to be said this is largely due to what...
...can only be descried as a conspiracy against me.
But Mr Greene surely your work is...
...widely admired by all the young poets?
Including dare I say it...
All young writers will turn at any trash that will sell.
It hurts me to say it.
For I love literature, as I love life.
But the art of poetry is dead in England.
You think so?
Of course... erhm...
That I have pension...
...of...
...300 pounds a year? paid...
...quarterly...
I'd live for literature alone..
I'd dedicate myself to fine writing.
But...sadly...
It's necessary to have a pension to do it.
About 300 pounds a year.
Paid quarterly.
Mr Greene, I wonder would you be so kind...
...as to give me your opinion of my efforts?
By all means... If
I can find the time.
For time is money.
And I must write to eat.
We're not in the pursuit of art.
Of course I will arrange for the small matter of the 300 pounds.
To be paid...
Quarterly?
As you wish.
- My dear friend.
'Death of a lover'.
Listen to this my friend.
This is the great work
Of my gracious host, the soon to be, congratulate me friend, my pension...
'His heart was broken'
'cleft in two'
'abandoned, lost'
'what could he do?'
'And into this he retched cried'
'She said she loved me'
'But she lied'
'And so betrayed'
'He fell and died'.
Try as he might.
This gracious noble lord.
Who lifts his pen.
And thinks he then can write.
Cannot, for who can pen.
When he is bored.
The mind of leisure only can be trite.
This pretty knight who feebly lifts his sword
To make a witless thrust against his doom.
Is foiled by what his noble birth affords
Dogs, dogs more dogs and far too many rooms.
So fortune smiles on those that own the land
And frowns at the trivia from the dabblers hand.
I would like you to drop this in the midst of the filthiest manure.
And Mr Greene's pension, sir?
Pay it, quarterly.
Abroad?
As your ambassador, your majesty.
Ambassador?
I see, once the balance of power...
...has been established here in Europe.
We must certainly turn our attention to the east.
Well Orlando.
I fear you will be quite starved of conversation...
...and amusement in such a remote corner of the world.
However, I believe they have an interest in...
...horticulture.
I'd like you to bring them some tulips.
POLITICS
My dear sir, please accept my hospitality.
Feel that my home is your home.
And call upon me as you would a brother, for any of your needs.
You really are to kind.
And I must say I'm most impressed by...
...your command of the English language.
I hadn't expect... I mean...
I wasn't led to believe...
Why...are you here?
I'm here as a representative of his majesty's government.
Yes?
It has been said to me that the
English make a habit of collecting...
...countries.
Oh. We have no designs upon your sovereignty at all.
No one at all.
You would assist us...
...in defence against mutual enemies?
So Orlando, I salute your country.
To England, green and pleasant land.
And...
And I salute your country...
So...
...spacious...
And...
So... warm.
Ah, yes.
To the glorious sun which shines so brightly on this bountiful earth.
Quite so.
Erm.
Yes.
Yes.
To beauty of nature.
And of course to the beauty of women.
And the joys of love.
I see.
You're here as a casualty of love, my friend.
They're not like us fellows.
Women...
...it is said...
...man should...
...reverence his guarding lord who created them.
And from a single being created of like nature his mate. then from those two...
...scattered like seeds...
...countless men...
...and women.
So Orlando...
Let us now drink to brotherly love.
To the manly virtues.
Loyalty.
Courage.
Take me to your master my dear fellow.
I said, take me to your master.
Do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
Now look I can assure you he'll would want to see me.
Just let me pass those, good now.
Lord Orlando?
I.. erh...
May I present myself, I am the archduke Harry.
Emissary from her majesty.
I have come to inform you that your ten years here as ambassador...
...have been well appreciated by her majesty. would like to celebrate the new century...
...by raising you...
...to the highest rank...
...in the...
...peerage.
Ahh.
There must be a party. well of course one must demonstrate the gravity of an investiture,
A large party, food and entertainment.
But of course you know that they call customs
Exactly who you should invite, to the ball. Who's who.
Strange.
Most strange.
Perhaps they don't hold punctuality in high regard?
As a representative of her majesty Queen Anne.
I am pleased...
...and honoured...
...to bestow the most noble Order of the Bath...
...upon this...
...loyal servant...
...for ambassadorial services rendered...
...to the Crown...
...and...
...for the glory of god.
I'm sorry to arrive in this fashion but we must talk.
But this is outrageous.
I was expecting you as a guest at my party, I...
...didn't realize you were entertaining hostilities.
I was warned that Englishman would be dangerous for me.
I would like to give you an opportunity to prove this wrong.
Then let me introduce you, this is the archduke Harry from England.
Delighted.
Orlando.
Our enemies are at the city wall.
Will you help?
You wish me to take arms?
Truly Orlando you an
Englishman are not afraid?
Sir.
My Lord.
Despite these appalling manners...
...we must keep our interests alive in this region.
What do you recommend.
Harry, distribute your arms.
- But these fellows?
Do as I say.
- But sir.
Follow me.
Brother.
Leave him.
Leave him.
This is a dying man.
He's not a man, he's the enemy.
Same person.
No difference at all.
Just a different sex.
Well, here I am again.
Some more invitations my lady.
Is not this the lady famed for her literary gatherings?
Yes ma'am, but you could not possibly venture there. Alone.
Why ever not?
Society ma'am is full of dangerous individuals, which and... poets.
âª Where you walk, call gale shall find the glade. âª
And how is your leg now Mr Swift?
I have to tell you that the gout have left...
...my left leg and is travelled to my right.
Aah, the conversation is of legs.
Gout Mr Pope.
You are an expert in this field?
I believe I can say I have some knowledge.
A little learning is a dangerous thing.
Mr Pope, I must write that down at once.
I already have madam.
If taken as a science the study of ailments can be quite fascinating.
Indeed I believe science to be interesting than poetry.
Do you?
Appraise sir, Elaborate.
We.. well the systematic study, exploration...
...and taming of the material world...
...is surely a proper occupation for a man.
Compared to which...
...the introvert art of scribbling...
...wishfully...
...the occupation of...of...
...a fool?
So I admit a general rule that every poet is a fool.
But you yourself may server to show it.
That every fool is not a poet.
Mr Pope, you're pleased to be witty.
They are all words and no breeding archduke.
But so amusing.
- Countess, forgive me.
But the young lady who has joined us...
...bears the extraordinary resemblance to...
The Lady Orlando.
Orlando.
I were so proud of you Harry.
The Order of the Bath.
Marvellous. Cream?
Well how pleasant it is I'd live to sip...
...tea in the presence of a gracious lady.
Do you Pestradus.
As our good friend Dr
Johnson says Every...
...man is or desires to be an... idler.
Perhaps not every woman Mr Swift.
Women have no desires, only affectation.
Indeed women are but children of larger growth.
Aah, but I consider woman to be a beautiful romantic animal.
Who should be adorned in...
Furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds.
Apart from my wife of course.
Will insist upon attempting to learn Greek.
It's so very unbecoming I can hardly tolerate her...
...company at the breakfast table. Why do they do it?
Oh, every woman is adverse to contradiction and frankly...
...most women have no characters at all.
Present company accepted of course.
Oh, the lady is aflame.
And silent.
Perfect.
Gentlemen.
I find it strange.
You are poets, each one of you and speak of your muse in the feminine.
And yet you appear to feel neither tenderness...
...nor respect towards your wives nor towards females in general.
Madam. I have only the highest regard...
...and purest respect for females.
I find no evidence of that sentiment in your conversation.
Conversation is a place where plays with ideas my dear lady.
The one forges them quite alone.
Quite so.
- Quite. Quite.
The intellect is a solitary place.
And therefore quite unsuitable a terrain for females who must...
...discover their natures through...
...the guidance of a father or husband.
And if she has neither?
Then...
However charming she may be dear lady...
She is lost.
None of us knew what had happened.
It is extraordinary.
And to think we could have been so charmingly misled.
Dear Lady. Orlando.
The same.
We wish to inform you.
Madam.
That you are a party to several major lawsuits that have...
...been preferred against you concerning the property.
The family seat.
Pray continue.
Erh heh.
One: You are legally dead and therefore...
...cannot hold any property whatsoever.
Ah.
Fine.
Two: You are now female.
Which amounts much the same thing.
Pending the legal judgment however..
You have the laws permission to reside in the property...
...in a state of incognito.
- Or incognita as the case may be.
Harry.
There is only one solution in your current predicament.
Indeed.
I can offer you a house to rival your own.
I don't quite understand.
I confess.
Orlando, to me you were and always will be, weather male or female...
The pink the pearl and the perfection of yourself?
I'm offering you my hand.
Oh. Archduke.
That is very kind of you, yes.
I can't accept.
But I...
I, am England.
And you are mine.
I see.
On what grounds?
That I adore you.
And this means that
I belong to you?
Are you refusing me?
- I am, I'm sorry.
But Orlando.
With your history quite frankly who else will have you?
Do you realize what you're turning down?
With your ambiguous sexuality which I am prepared to tolerate.
This is your last chance of respectability.
Can't breathe.
You will die a spinster, dispossessed and alone.
Spinster.
Alone.
Nature, nature, I'm your bride. Take me.
You're hurt ma'am?
I'm dead, sir.
Dead. That's serious. Can I help?
Will you marry me?
Ma'am... I would gladly... um, I... but I fear my ankle is twisted.
What's that?
The future.
Some milk? My god I don't yet know your name, sir.
How strange, I feel as though
I know everything about you.
When like meets like.
My name is Shelmerdine.
Orlando.
So.. it only remains to fill in such unimportant details as..
What we do and so on.
Well you can see for yourself what I was.
Was?
You see, I'm about to lose everything.
Then you can come with me.
Where are you going?
Back to America?
When the wind changes to the south-west.
America.
I've been abroad.
But east.
Then you know as well as I, how good it is to travel.
Like a free spirit.
Unfettered by position or possession.
Unfettered.
Are you...
An adventurer by profession?
My profession, if you can call it that...
...it's the pursuit of liberty.
The bright shade, of some immortal dream.
Which walks when tempus sleeps.
The wave of life's dark stream.
You don't really want a husband.
I suppose your journey is to be hazardous at times.
Think, you want a lover.
You've fought in battles?
Like a man?
I have fought.
Blood?
If necessary, yes.
Freedom must be taken, if it must be won.
If I were a man...
You?
I might choose not to risk my life for an uncertain cause.
I might think that freedom won by death is not worth having.
In fact...
You might choose not to be a real man at all.
Say, if I were a woman...
You?
I might choose not to sacrifice my life caring for my children, nor my children's children, nor to drown anonymously in the milk of female kindness, but instead, say, to go abroad.
Would I then be...
A real woman?
I think I'm going to faint. I've never felt better in my life.
Rise, from pains of thee.
From first sweet sleep of night.
Winds are breathing low.
Heavens stars are shining bright.
But it is day.
Days are nice.
Mingling are sweet embrace on end.
Who's there?
Excuse me my lady, there are two officers...
...outside with a warrant from the queen.
The queen?
Victoria, ma'am. The gentlemen say they must speak to you in person.
Oh.
I'd almost forgotten.
Her ladyship.
The lawsuit is settled.
My sex is pronounced indisputably and...
...beyond shadow of a doubt... female...
Therefore heirs made of my body will risk it taking...
...as red. I lose everything unless I have a son.
So you're free.
I think the spirit of this century is finally taken me and broken me.
I would be sad if it were true.
But it is not.
Come with me.
I cannot.
I can't just follow you.
You can stay and stagnate in the past or leave...
...and live for the future, the choice is yours.
As a man one has choices, Shelmerdine.
Orlando, you can do whatever you want.
Would you like to have a child with me?
So that you can keep your house?
No, not for the house
Shelmerdine. Perhaps for love?
These are the times that try men's souls.
My love is for mankind,
I must fight for liberty.
I must fight for a future.
- For a future?
This future of yours Shelmerdine, when it's gonna begin... today? or is it always tomorrow?
TouchÃ© Orlando.
The wind.
The wind.
The south-west wind.
Good bye, Shelmerdine. Good luck.
Orlando.
It's really very good.
Written from the heart.
I think it'll sell.
Provided you rewrite it. You know.
Increase the love interest.
Give it a happy ending.
By the way, how long did this draft take you?
Come on. Come on.
She.
For there can be no doubt about her sex.
Is visiting the house she finally lost for...
...the first time in over a hundred years.
She does still have certain natural advantages of course.
She is tall and slim, with a slightly androgynous...
...appearance that many females at the time aspire to.
Then her upbringing, she's lived for four hundred years and hardly aged a day.
And because this is England.
Everyone pretends not to notice.
But she has changed.
She is no longer trapped by destiny.
And... ever since she let go of the past...
She found her life was beginning.
âª I am coming. I am coming. âª...
...âª I am coming through. âª...
...âª Coming across the divide to you âª...
...âª In this moment of unity âª...
...âª feeling an ecstasy âª...
...âª to be here, to be now âª...
...âª At last I am free âª
Why are you sad?
I'm not. I'm happy.
Look. Look up there.
âª Yes at last, at last âª...
...âª to be free of the past âª...
...âª and of the future that beckons me âª...

- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.
Another penguin sighting! Check it out!
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!
May I have your attention, Gotham City?
It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.
How about that?
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!
Read about the possible terror beneath our feet! Check it out!
Read about it!
Missing link between man and bird.
My dear boy...
...sometimes it's a diversion to read such rubbish.
Usually, it's a waste of time.
Whatever. Today's issue!
"The Penguin: Man or myth?"
The Globe! Right here! 25 cents!
Well, here's hoping.
With luck, Gotham will have its first merry Christmas in years.
I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide...
...mentioning the new power plant.
But if we're to break ground when we must, I'll need permits...
...variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.
Power plant?
Studies show we've enough power to get us into the middle of the next century.
Your analysts foresee growth at 1% per annum. That's a mild swelling.
Imagine...
...a Gotham City...
...of the future, lit up like a blanket of stars...
...but blinking on and off...
...embarrassingly low on juice.
Frankly...
...I cringe, Mr. Mayor.
Sorry, any plans must go to the usual committees...
...through the usual channels.
I have a suggestion.
Well...
...actually, really, just more like a question.
I'm afraid we haven't properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.
In the plus column, though...
...she makes great coffee.
Dad.
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down and bring joy to the masses.
"Actually, more of a question."
You stupid corn dog.
Corn dog, corn dog.
I have enough signatures from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.
Maybe. But you sure as hell don't have an issue or a candidate.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
From those of us at City Hall to each and every one of you...
... happy holidays.
We have with us a man who needs no introduction, he's given us so much.
Please welcome Gotham's own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.
Pick up those contracts for Personnel and...
...pick up the dry cleaning and paper towels...
Darn!
I forgot my speech.
Remind me to take it out on what's-her-name.
Santa Claus?
Afraid not.
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.
Sue me...
... if I want to give some back.
I only wish I could hand out more than just...
... expensive baubles.
I wish I could hand out world peace...
... and unconditional love...
... wrapped in a big bow.
Oh, but you can.
Oh, but you will.
Merry Christmas.
Great idea.
Not mine.
What are you waiting for? The signal!
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!
What do you want?
Not you!
Shreck!
You'll have to go through me.
Dad, go! Save yourself!
Dad, go!
Shut up!
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll...
You missed.
The Batman.
Or is it just "Batman"?
Your choice, of course.
Well, that was...
...very brief.
Just like all the men in my life.
What men?
Well...
...then again, there's you.
But you need therapy.
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
The Circus Gang is back.
We'll see.
They almost made off with our mover and shaker, Max Shreck.
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?
I believe the word you're looking for is...
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.
You're at home in bed...
...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...
...dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed...
...in a lifetime of profiteering.
Tragic irony...
...or poetic justice?
You tell me.
My God, it's true.
Penguin Man of the sewer.
Odd as it may seem, Max...
...you and I have something in common:
We're both perceived as monsters.
But somehow...
...you're a well-respected monster...
...and I am, to date...
...not!
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.
Tough, yes.
Shrewd, okay. But that does not make me a monster.
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!
I know all about you.
What you hide, I discover.
What you put in your toilet...
...I place on my mantle. Get the picture?
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?
No, just give you a splitting headache.
It's not working.
Oh, you big baby!
Just blanks.
Would I go through all this trouble just to kill you?
No, Max.
I have an entirely other purpose.
I'm ready, Max.
I've been down here too long.
It's time for me to ascend...
...to re-emerge...
...with your help...
...your know-how... your savvy
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.
I come from...
...like you.
And, like you, I want some respect!
A recognition of my basic humanity.
But most of all...
...I want to find out who I am...
...by finding my parents...
...learning my human name.
Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted!
And...
...exactly why am I going to help you?
Well...
Let's start.
Let's see what we have in here.
A batch of toxic waste...
...from your clean textile plant!
There's a whole lagoon of this crud in the back!
It could have come from anywhere.
What about the documents that prove you own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?
If there were such documents...
...that's not an admission...
...they would've been shredded.
Good idea.
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.
By the way...
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?
Fred?
Fred's actually...
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.
Good.
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!
Want to greet any other body parts?
Remember, Max...
...you flush it, I flaunt it.
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?
I think, perhaps...
...I could help orchestrate a "Welcome Home" scenario for you.
Once we're both back home, perhaps we could help each other.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Honey, I'm home!
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.
Miss Kitty.
Back from more sexual escapades you refuse to share?
Not that I'd ever pry.
Drink your dinner.
What?
How can anyone be so pathetic?
Yes, to you I seem pathetic, but I'm a working girl.
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you chipped in instead of stepping out.
Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.
Yeah, but...
But I'm disappointed you're not coming home for Christmas.
I want to discuss why you insist on languishing in Gotham City...
... as some lowly secretary.
Lowly assistant.
Selina, about that Christmas getaway we planned...
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need to be my own person, not an appendage.
Some appendage!
The party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine.
I should've let him win that last racquetball game.
Hello...
... Selina Kyle.
We're calling to tell you about exciting, new Gotham Lady perfume.
It makes women feel like women... and the men have no complaints either.
This is yourself reminding you to come all the way back to the office...
- ... if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file...
- You stupid corn dog!
Working late?
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.
I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant...
...and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
I even opened the protected files...
How industrious!
How did you open the protected files?
May I ask?
I figured your password was "Geraldo," your Chihuahua, and it was.
This is all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side...
...about how the power plant is a power plant in name only...
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big, giant...
...big, giant... capacitor.
And, instead of generating power, it'll be sucking power from...
...Gotham City...
...and storing it...
...stockpiling it...
...which is a very novel approach, I'd say.
Who'd you say this to?
Nobody.
What did curiosity do to the cat?
I'm no cat.
I'm just an assistant.
A secretary.
And a very good one.
Too good?
Listen...
...it's our secret. Honest.
How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
This power plant...
...is my legacy. It's what I leave behind.
For Chip.
Nothing must prevent that.
Go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.
It's not like you can kill me!
Actually, it's a lot like that.
For a second, you really frightened me.
Really?
Honey, I'm home!
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.
Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?
Hello, Selina Kyle.
We're just calling to make sure you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.
One whiff of this and your boss will ask you to stay after work...
... for a candlelight staff meeting for two.
Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...
...so much yummier.
Ladies and gentlemen:
I stand before you again to denounce the urban chaos we live with in our city.
It's got to stop.
It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...
... in a season when it should be coming together.
I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...
... and should be a healing time.
I say that not only as an official...
... but as a husband and a father.
Last night's violence won't happen again.
I'm not good at speeches, so I'll just say, "Thanks."
It's the hideous Penguin Man.
Take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please!
This was the remarkable scene only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.
The mysterious Penguin saving the life of the mayor's baby...
- ... and announcing his presence.
- All I want in return...
... is a chance...
... to find my mom and dad.
A chance to find out who they are...
... and thusly...
... who I am.
And then...
... with my parents...
... try to understand... why.
Why they did what I guess they felt they had to do...
... to a child...
... who was born...
... a little different.
A child...
... who spent his first Christmas...
... and many since...
... in a sewer.
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?
His parents.
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.
I hope he finds them.
Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.
How about a statement?
People want to know.
- Penguin's not to be disturbed!
- It's a public place!
- Walk. Now. Move.
- Freedom of the press!
Wait a minute.
What about the freedom to rediscover your roots...
...with dignity and privacy?
Is the Penguin a personal friend?
He's a personal friend of the whole city, so have a heart.
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.
"Red Triangle Circus put on a swell show with fierce lions.
"Circus returns for a two-week...
"Kids will love..."
Thanks.
It's cold!
It's vichyssoise.
It's supposed to be cold.
"Circus is back with a freak show, may not be suitable for kids...
"...featuring a poodle lady...
"...the world's fattest man...
"...and Aquatic Bird Boy."
Why are you determined to prove...
...that this Penguin is not what he seems?
Must you be the only lonely "man-beast" in town?
"The circus folded its tents yesterday...
"...after reports of missing children in several towns.
"Police have closed down the Red Triangle fairgrounds.
"However, at least one freak-show performer vanished before...
"...he could be questioned."
I suppose you feel better now.
No.
Actually, I feel worse.
Why're you still out?
Are you concerned about that strange, heroic Penguin person?
I think he knows who his parents are.
There's something else.
Mr. Penguin...
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!
I am a man!
I have a name!
Oswald Cobblepot!
You'll never be able to settle with them?
True.
I was their "Number-One" son...
...and they treated me like number two.
But it's human nature to fear...
...the unusual.
Perhaps...
...when I held my...
...Tiffany baby rattle...
...with a shiny flipper...
...instead of five chubby digits...
...they freaked.
But I forgive them.
"Penguin forgives parents!
'I'm at peace with myself and the world!
"'Don't need hands as long as you got heart.
"'My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall."'
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.
Now, now, pretty little thing.
Nice and easy.
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid to show it with someone half his size.
Be gentle, it's my first time.
Tic-tac-toe.
You make it easy, don't you?
Always waiting for some Batman to save you.
I am Catwoman...
...hear me roar.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Good time. Everyone but the bandits'll be slacking off till after the New Year.
I'm not sure I like the inference.
I didn't realize I made one.
I'm pushing this power plant now because it'll cost more later.
A million saved is a million earned.
I commissioned this report.
Take a look at it.
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that.
My question is:
What's your angle?
"Power surplus?" Bruce, shame on you!
No such thing. One can never have too much power.
If my life has a meaning, that's the meaning.
I'll fight you. I've already spoken to the mayor and we agree.
Mayors come and go.
Blue bloods tire easily.
Can you go 15 rounds with Muhammad Shreck?
I guess we'll find out.
Of course, I don't have a crime boss like Cobblepot in my corner.
"Crime boss?" Shows what you know...
..."Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-
With-A-Silver-Spoon."
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.
If his parents hadn't 86'ed him, you'd have been bunkies at prep school.
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both...
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.
If my assistant was here, she'd have already escorted you out...
Anywhere he wants.
Preferably some nightspot grotto... or
...secluded hideaway.
Nice suit.
That's my name, don't wear it out or I'll make you buy me a new one.
This is Bruce...
...Wayne.
We've met.
Have we?
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.
You mean, "mistook me."
Isn't that what I said?
I don't think so.
What happened?
Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope?
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?
It's a blur.
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...
...and Betsy saying it was morning sickness.
And the time I forgot to wear my underpants to school...
...and the name of the boy who noticed was Ricky Friedburg.
He's dead now.
But last night...
...complete blur.
Couldn't you just die?
Please...
...show out Mr. Wayne.
With pleasure.
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Shreck.
No. You don't seem like the type to take orders from him.
Well, that's a...
...long story.
I could free up some time.
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.
I'm working.
I'm leaving.
You buy that blurry business?
Women.
Nothing surprises me...
...except your late mother.
Who'd have thought Selina had a brain to damage?
Bottom line?
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.
Meantime...
...l've got badder fish to fry.
Oswald...
...it's Max.
You're home?
How've you been?
Your extended family?
Good to have a family.
I'd rather not be disturbed now.
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.
I don't like surprises.
Come on.
Don't peek.
You'll spoil it.
Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.
But someone's got to supplant our standing in the way of progress, Mayor.
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic.
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.
Mayor?
Mayor.
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.
Don't worry.
I want you to meet Jen and Josh, my image consultants.
Here.
Reclaim your birthright.
I'm Jen.
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first is put these gloves on you.
Our research tells us that voters like fingers.
So if we were to just lose this...
We'll do it another time.
Not a lot of reflective surfaces in the sewer, huh?
Still, it could be worse.
My nose could be gushing blood.
What do you mean by that?
Everybody, back to work!
Let's make...
...a mayor!
You're right, we missed the regular election...
...but elected officials can be recalled, impeached...
...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.
Then think of you...
...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.
I'd like to fill her void.
We'll need signatures to overturn the ballot. I can supply those.
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- We need one more thing.
A platform?
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world an icebox.
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled, we must have a catalyst.
"You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot."
"Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."
"I need you, Oswald. I need you now!"
"That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen."
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin, or the Reichstag fire...
You want my old friends up there...
...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.
But...
...I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.
I have my own things to tend to.
"Sidetracked?" This is your chance to fulfill your destiny...
...that your parents carelessly discarded.
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?
Lmagine, as mayor, you have the ear of the media...
...access to the captains of industry...
...unlimited poontang.
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.
All right, I'll be mayor.
Burn, baby, burn!
- Who is she?
- What is she?
I don't know whether to open fire or fall in love.
You poor guys.
Always confusing your pistols with your privates.
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's less than $300.
You're overpaid. Hit the road.
Go ahead and hit me.
Admiring your handiwork?
Touring the riot scene.
Gravely assessing the devastation.
"Upstanding-Mayor" stuff.
You're not the mayor.
Things change.
What do you want?
The direct approach.
I admire that in a man with a mask.
You don't really think you'll win, do you?
Things change.
I saw her first. Got to fly.
How could you? I'm a woman!
I'm sorry.
As I was saying, I'm a woman and can't be taken for granted.
Life's a bitch, now so am I.
Who are you?
Who's the man behind the bat?
Maybe you can help me find...
...the woman...
...behind the cat.
No, that's not you.
There you are.
Saved by Kitty Litter.
Bastard!
Alfred...
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?
Not really.
I may have saved the mayor's baby...
...but I refuse to save a mayor...
...who stood by, helpless as a baby...
...while Gotham was ravaged by a disease...
...that turned Eagle Scouts into crazed clowns...
...and happy homemakers into catwomen.
Thank you.
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast, made his bid to run Gotham.
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest role model a young person could have.
And you're the hottest young person...
...a role model could have.
Here.
Wear a button.
Let me just get it on here.
Thank you.
This mayor stuff is not about power, it's about reaching out to people...
...touching people, groping people.
- Penguin...
- My name is not Penguin!
It's Oswald Cobblepot.
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.
Just the pussy I've been looking for.
It's chilly in here.
I'll warm you.
Down, Oswald.
We need to talk.
You see...
...you and I have something in common.
Sounds familiar.
Appetite for destruction?
Contempt for the czars of fashion?
Wait, don't tell me.
Naked sexual charisma?
Batman.
The thorn in both our sides.
The fly in our ointment.
Ointment?
I've got scented and unscented.
I'll come back later.
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.
I have but one pet cause today:
Ban the Bat.
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.
We'll disassemble his Batmobile and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.
He'd have even more power as a martyr.
To destroy Batman, we must first turn him into what he hates the most.
Namely, us.
Frame him?
Not even in office yet and already an enemies list.
Those names are not for prying eyes.
Why should I trust some catbroad anyway?
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick getting back at her daddy...
...for not buying her that pony when she turned sweet-sixteen.
Nice birdie.
Nice kitty.
Nice kitty.
Batman napalmed my arm.
He knocked me off a building just when I started to feel good about myself.
I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
A plan is forming.
I want in.
The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all...
...dirty.
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath right here.
I challenge the mayor...
... to re-light the Christmas tree in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.
Sir, shall we change the channel to a program with some dignity and class?
The Love Connection perhaps?
... not that I have any faith in the mayor.
But I hope and pray...
... that Batman...
... will be present to preserve the peace.
Subtle.
Why are you doing this?
Selina?
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Scare me? I was just scaring myself.
I don't see how, but...
It's nice to see you in the real world, away from Shreck.
It's nice to be here.
Are you all right?
You look like you have the holiday blues or something.
Boy, the news these days.
Weird!
I heard on TV that Catwoman weighs 140 pounds.
How do these hacks sleep at night?
It's not even accurate. "Batman blows it"?
He probably saved millions in property damage alone.
You're not going to the re-lighting of the tree, are you?
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
It's going to be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?
No darker than yours.
Why don't you come over and we can watch it on TV?
The tree-lighting ceremony.
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.
How about coming for dinner at five?
Let's say six?
Five.
Five. You and me.
The tree lights up and then I push the button.
Wait, wait.
I push the button, then the tree lights up.
Who are you?
Talent scout.
Come in.
I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress as well.
What is that thing?
A camera or something?
Say, "Cheese!"
Cheese.
Thanks, Alfred.
I'm sure he's wonderful company...
...but doesn't the "gold-plated-bachelor" bit get a little stale?
A lot like the "lonely-secretary" syndrome,
I guess.
Executive Assistant.
Sorry.
Secretary.
Any girlfriend?
Sure.
You mean, as in serious?
No. Had one, didn't work.
What went wrong? Hang on!
I think I know!
You kept things from her.
I told her everything.
The truth frightened her?
There are two truths...
...you know?
She had trouble reconciling them because I had trouble...
...reconciling them.
Vicki thought...
Vicki?
Ice skater or stewardess?
No, she was a photojournalist.
Was Vicki right about your...
...difficulty with duality?
You see...
...if I say yes, then...
...you'll think of me as a...
...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...
You might not let me kiss you.
It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down.
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.
I can't do that.
Neither can I.
This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.
Can you confirm reports of Batman's suspected involvement in the abduction?
The evidence is purely circumstantial.
This was found, stained with blood, in the missing girl's dressing room.
- I must go.
- No, it's your house.
Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax.
I'll be right back.
I've got to go to the plaza.
- He is begging me to show.
- I hoped you'd snub him.
I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.
Shit!
Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle,
I had to go out of town.
Tell her that a big business deal came up...
You know what?
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
"be-my-girlfriend" way...
I'll relay the message.
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that...
Bruce, yes...
Would you tell him...
...l've been going through... a lot of changes and...
Just that...
...this is not a rejection...
...my abruptly leaving.
In fact, he makes me feel the way...
...I hope I really am.
Could you just make up a sonnet or... a dirty limerick?
One has just sprung to mind.
This way, ma'am.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Please, may I have your attention?
I know that to many of you...
... Gotham seems a bit beleaguered these days.
But I want you to know your elected officials...
... and your police department...
... have the situation well in hand.
Got to hurry.
Thank you.
It was set up to look like I did it.
I'll tell the police I was kidnapped by an ugly birdman with fish breath.
Did somebody say fish?
I haven't been fed all day.
Eat floor.
High fiber.
Hey, stud...
...I thought we had something together.
- We do.
Got to go. Girl talk.
She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned with her, girl-to-girl.
Be careful. Don't move.
Lawn dart!
Rats with wings, do your thing.
Batman pushed the Princess!
Hold your fire!
You're catnip to a girl like me.
Handsome, dazed...
...and to die for.
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.
But a kiss...
...can be even deadlier if you mean it.
You're the second man who's killed me this week.
But I've got seven lives left.
I tried to save you...
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead.
Or deeply resentful.
Maybe you should retire.
Damn.
Outstanding!
You're Beauty and the Beast...
...in one luscious Christmas gift pack.
You said you'd scare the Ice Princess.
She looked pretty scared to me.
A touch of the bubbly?
So what are we waiting for?
Let's consummate our fiendish union.
What?
Oh, come on.
Can't you picture?
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.
I'm bushed, so here you come into the bedroom...
...twitching your little tail...
...my slippers in one hand, a dry martini in the other.
Please.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
You lousy minx! I should have you spayed!
You sent out all the signals!
I don't think I like you anymore!
Good-bye, my unintended.
Go to heaven.
There he is!
Don't adjust your sets.
Welcome...
... to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.
Gentlemen, start your screaming.
This may be a bad time to mention it, but my license has expired!
Relax.
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham!
You must admit I played this stinking city like a harp from hell!
Helpless old lady at 12:00 high!
That's funny.
Now I'm a little worried.
So he survived. Why worry?
He didn't even lose a limb!
An eyeball! Bladder control!
Listen to them. They've lost faith in old symbols.
They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.
If it works, don't fix it.
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual ball.
Shreck and Cobblepot...
...the visionary alliance.
When it came time...
... to ensure the safety of our fair city...
... did the mayor have a plan?
No!
He relied on a man.
A Batman.
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...
Our prime concern is this ghastly grotesque.
But let's not forget about repairing the Batmobile.
There's security to consider.
We can't just take it to any old body shop.
Security?
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?
I'm working, I turn around and there she is.
"Hi, Vick. Come on in."
- Ready?
- I'll take the stairs.
You ask... am I up here for personal glory?
No.
The glory that I yearn to recapture...
... is the glory of Gotham!
How can this be accomplished?
I know...
... you're all concerned.
Relax.
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham.
I didn't say that.
You must admit I played this stinking city...
... like a harp from hell!
You must admit...
... I played this stinking city like a harp from hell!
Why is there always someone who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?
There he is!
My babies.
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Great speech, Oswald.
My name is not Oswald!
It's Penguin!
I am not a human being!
I am an animal. Cold-blooded!
Crank the A.C.!
Where are my lists? Bring me the names!
It's time.
These are the names of the first-born sons of Gotham City.
Just like I was.
And like me, a terrible fate waits for them.
Tonight, while their parents party...
...they'll be dreaming away...
...in their safe cribs...
...their soft beds...
...and we'll snatch them...
...carry them into the sewer...
...and toss them into a deep, dark, watery grave.
Penguin?
Killing sleeping children...
...isn't that a little...
No, it's a lot.
A reminder.
Tonight is that loathsome party hosted by the odious Mr. Shreck.
May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Not interested.
Although...
...Selina Kyle might be there.
Ingenious costume.
Let me guess.
Trust-fund goody-goody?
Feeling good?
You almost made a monster the mayor of Gotham City.
I am the light of this city...
...and I am its mean, twisted soul.
Does it matter who's mayor?
It does to me.
Yawn.
I'm sorry about yesterday, but I had...
...a pretty big deal come through.
Fall through, actually.
It's okay. I had to go home and feed my cat.
No hard feelings then?
Actually...
...semi-hard, I'd say.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.
Why don't we...
Take off our costumes?
I'm tired of wearing masks.
Me too.
Let me ask you something.
Why'd you come tonight?
- You first.
- To see you.
Lovely.
I wish I could say the same, but I came for Max.
Do you mean you...
Not you and Max?
Me and Max?
No. This and Max.
Don't tell me killing Max won't solve anything, because it will.
Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron...
...coming out on top when he should be six feet under?
You may have problems with your boss, but who do you think you are?
I don't know anymore, Bruce.
A kiss under the mistletoe.
"Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it."
"But a kiss can be even deadlier...
"...if you mean it."
Oh, my God.
Does this mean we have to start fighting?
Let's go outside.
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.
You didn't invite me...
...so I crashed!
What do you want?
Right now, my troops...
...are fanning out across town...
...for your children!
Yes!
For your first-born sons!
The ones you left defenseless at home...
...so you could dress up like jerks...
...get juiced and dance...
...badly!
I've personally come...
...for Gotham's favorite son...
...Mr. Chip Shreck.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope...
...to die, way down in the sewer!
Not Chip. If you have any human feeling, take me instead.
I don't. So, no!
I'm the one you want.
Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?
Isn't it Max, not Chip...
...you want to see immersed to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Okay, you got a point.
I'll let the little prince live, for now.
In the duck!
This is going to be good...
...to cut down a whole crop of Gotham's most promising...
...before their prime.
You ask me... how do I lure them in?
A little "Pied Penguin" action.
And you get to watch them sink...
...into a deep puddle...
...of your industrial by-products.
Then...
...you join them.
Hurry up and get those kids loaded.
Right this way, kiddies.
Come with me.
So where are all the children?
"Dear Penguin:
"The children regret they're unable to attend.
"Batman!"
My dear penguins...
...we stand on a great threshold!
It's okay to be scared!
Many of you won't be coming back.
Thanks to Batman...
...the time has come...
...to punish all God's children!
First-, second-, third- and fourth-born!
Why be biased?
Male and female!
Hell, the sexes are equal...
...with their erogenous zones...
...blown sky-high!
Forward...
...march!
The liberation of Gotham...
...has begun!
The penguins are moving above ground.
Penguin army...
... approaching launch destination at Gotham Plaza.
One minute until ignition.
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...
...so I'm laying them on a slab!
Penguins seem to be converging on Gotham Plaza.
Thirty seconds until ignition.
Estimated casualties after launch:
100,000 people.
The penguins have reached
Gotham Square.
Fifteen seconds to ignition.
Ready when you are, sir.
I've got the coordinates.
Let's turn them around.
Something is wrong.
Something has jammed the signal.
They seem to be turning around.
There is also something coming this way.
Very large. Very fast.
Who's there?
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.
You're jealous because I'm a genuine freak...
...and you have to wear a mask!
You might be right.
But what it all comes down to is:
Who's holding the umbrella?
My babies!
I don't know what you want, but I can get it with a minimum of fuss.
Money.
Jewels.
A very big ball of string.
Your blood, Max.
I gave at the office.
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.
Let's make a deal!
Other than my blood, what can I do?
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.
You're not just saving a life...
Shut up. You're going to jail.
Don't be naive. The law doesn't apply to people like him... or us.
Wrong on both counts.
Why do this?
Let's just take him to the police.
Then we can go home...
...together.
Selina...
...don't you see?
We're the same.
We're the same.
Split...
...down the center.
Please.
Bruce...
...I would love to live with you in your castle...
...forever, just like in a fairy tale.
I just couldn't live with myself.
Don't pretend this is a happy ending.
Selina Kyle.
You're fired.
And Bruce Wayne...
...why are you dressed up like Batman?
Because he is Batman, you moron!
Was.
Don't.
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.
Three lives down.
Got enough to finish me off?
One way to find out.
Four.
Five.
Still alive!
Six.
Seven.
All good girls go to heaven.
Two lives left.
I'll save one for next Christmas.
But in the meantime...
...how about a kiss, Santie Claus?
Shit!
I picked a cute one.
The heat's getting to me.
I'll murder you momentarily.
But first...
...I need a cool drink...
...of ice water.
Stop the car.
Come what may...
...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Merry Christmas, Alfred.
Goodwill toward men.
And women.
{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{446}{529}Long ago, in the faraway land|of ancient Greece...
{535}{598}there was a golden age|of powerful gods...
{604}{666}and extraordinary heroes.
{672}{741}And the greatest and strongest|of all these heroes...
{747}{810}was the mighty Hercules.
{816}{878}But what is the measure|of a true hero?
{884}{932}Ah, that is what our story is...
{938}{968}Will you listen to him?
{974}{1041}He's makin' the story|sound like some Greek tragedy.
{1047}{1079}Lighten up, dude.
{1085}{1130}We'll take it from here, darling.
{1136}{1210}You go, girl.
{1216}{1263}We are the muses...
{1269}{1353}goddesses of the arts|and proclaimers of heroes.
{1359}{1397}Heroes like Hercules.
{1403}{1446}Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules".
{1452}{1503}Ooh, I'd like to make|some sweet music with him...
{1509}{1571}Our story actually begins...
{1577}{1624}long before Hercules...
{1630}{1677}many eons ago.
{1683}{1717}{y:i}Ah
{1723}{1790}{y:i}Back when the world was new
{1796}{1858}- Whoa!|{y:i}- The planet Earth was down on its luck
{1864}{2012}{y:i}And everywhere gigantic brutes|{y:i}called Titans ran amok
{2018}{2084}{y:i}It was a nasty place
{2090}{2150}{y:i}There was a mess|{y:i}wherever ya stepped
{2156}{2265}{y:i}Where chaos reigned and earthquakes|{y:i}and volcanoes never slept
{2271}{2304}Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!
{2310}{2342}{y:i}And then along came Zeus
{2348}{2413}{y:i}- He hurled his thunderbolt|{y:i}- He zapped
{2419}{2498}{y:i}- Locked those suckers in a vault|{y:i}- They're trapped
{2504}{2591}{y:i}And on his own|{y:i}stopped chaos in its tracks
{2597}{2630}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{2636}{2740}{y:i}The guy was too "Type A"|{y:i}to just relax
{2746}{2812}{y:i}- And that's the world's first dish|- Yeah, baby.
{2818}{2887}{y:i}Zeus tamed the globe|{y:i}while still in his youth
{2893}{2954}{y:i}Though, honey|{y:i}it may seem impossible
{2960}{3034}{y:i}That's the gospel truth
{3040}{3092}{y:i}On Mount Olympus life was neat
{3098}{3168}{y:i}And smooth as sweet vermouth
{3174}{3247}{y:i}Although, honey|{y:i}it may seem impossible
{3253}{3403}{y:i}That's the gospel truth
{3409}{3498}{y:i}- Ah, ah|{y:i}- Ah
{3504}{3598}{y:i}- Ah, ah|{y:i}- Oh, yeah, yeah
{3604}{3695}{y:i}- Ah, ah|{y:i}- Hey, hey, hey
{3701}{3835}{y:i}- Ah, ah|{y:i}- Hey, yeah
{4350}{4426}Hercules!
{4432}{4514}Behave yourself.
{4533}{4611}Oh, look at this.
{4617}{4690}Look how cute he is.
{4771}{4833}Hah! Oh, he's strong...
{4839}{4882}like his dad, hmm?
{4888}{4930}Whoa! Excuse me!|Hot stuff coming through!
{4936}{5002}Excuse me.|One side, Ares.
{5008}{5072}Why, Hermes, they're lovely.
{5078}{5130}Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus|do the arrangement.
{5136}{5190}Isn't that too nutty?
{5196}{5261}Fabulous party. You know, I haven't|seen this much love in a room...
{5267}{5362}since Narcissus discovered himself.
{5383}{5441}Dear, keep those|away from the baby.
{5447}{5495}Oh, he won't hurt himself.
{5501}{5596}Let the kid have a little fun.
{5778}{5849}On behalf of my son,|I want to thank you all...
{5855}{5922}for your wonderful gifts!
{5928}{5965}What about our gift, dear?
{5971}{6042}Well, let's see here.|We'll take... Hmm, yes.
{6048}{6154}A little cirrus and, uh, hmm,|a touch of nimbostratus...
{6160}{6280}and a dash of cumulus.
{6335}{6411}His name is Pegasus...
{6417}{6524}and he's all yours, son.
{6773}{6806}Mind his head.
{6812}{6893}He's so tiny.
{6985}{7027}My boy.
{7033}{7121}My little Hercules.
{7127}{7190}How sentimental.
{7196}{7248}You know, I haven't been|this choked up...
{7254}{7318}since I got a hunk of moussaka|caught in my throat!
{7324}{7377}Huh?
{7383}{7425}So is this an audience|or a mosaic?
{7431}{7485}Hey, how you doin'?|Lookin' good. Nice dress.
{7491}{7549}So, Hades,|you finally made it.
{7555}{7594}How are things|in the underworld?
{7600}{7664}Well, they're just fine. You know,|a little dark, a little gloomy.
{7670}{7720}And, as always,|hey, full of dead people.
{7726}{7798}What are you gonna do? Ah!|There's the little sunspot.
{7804}{7896}Little snootchie. And here is a sucker|for the little sucker.
{7902}{7980}Eh? Here you go.|You just...
{8006}{8041}Sheesh!
{8047}{8096}Uh, powerful little tyke.
{8102}{8181}Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.|Join the celebration!
{8187}{8242}Hey. Love to, babe...
{8248}{8312}but unlike you gods|lounging about up here...
{8318}{8372}I regrettably|have a full-time gig...
{8378}{8459}that you, by the way,|so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.
{8465}{8542}So, can't.|Love to, but can't.
{8548}{8634}You ought to slow down.|You'll work yourself to death.
{8640}{8746}Hah! Work yourself to death!
{8764}{8818}Oh, I kill myself!
{8824}{8888}If only. If only.
{8894}{8995}If there's one god you don't want|to get steamed up, it's Hades.
{9001}{9060}'Cause he had an evil plan.
{9066}{9171}{y:i}He ran the underworld
{9177}{9265}{y:i}But thought the dead|{y:i}were dull and uncouth
{9271}{9348}{y:i}He was as mean|{y:i}as he was ruthless
{9354}{9445}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{9451}{9560}{y:i}He had a plan|{y:i}to shake things up
{9566}{9828}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{9930}{9967}Pain!
{9973}{10081}Coming,|your most lugubriousness. Ow!
{10124}{10248}- Panic!|- Oh, I'm sorry. I can handle it!
{10395}{10457}- Pain! Oh!|- And Panic!
{10463}{10509}Reporting for duty!
{10515}{10592}Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know|the instant the Fates arrive.
{10598}{10637}Oh. They're here.
{10643}{10747}What? The Fates are here,|and you didn't tell me?
{10753}{10869}We are worms!|Worthless worms!
{10875}{10997}Memo to me, memo to me:|maim you after my meeting.
{11037}{11158}Darling, hold that mortal's|thread of life...
{11164}{11258}good and tight.
{11330}{11405}Incoming!
{11584}{11638}Ladies.|I am so sorry that I'm...
{11644}{11690}- Late!|- We knew you would be.
{11696}{11744}We know everything.
{11750}{11798}- Past.|- Present.
{11804}{11847}And future.
{11853}{11920}Indoor plumbing.|It's gonna be big.
{11926}{11984}Great, gr... Anyway, see, ladies, I|was at this party and I lost track of...
{11990}{12079}- We know!|- Yeah. I know you know.
{12085}{12155}So here's the deal. Zeus...
{12161}{12252}Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, You,|Get Off Of My Cloud,"... now he has...
{12258}{12332}- A bouncing baby brat.|- We know!
{12338}{12401}I know you know!|I know. I got it.
{12407}{12461}I got the concept.|So let me just ask:
{12467}{12538}is this kid gonna mess up|my hostile takeover bid, or what?
{12544}{12601}- What do you think?|- Oh, no you don't.
{12607}{12703}We're not supposed|to reveal the future.
{12709}{12749}Oh, wait. I'm sorry.|Time out. Can I...
{12755}{12794}Can I ask you a question by the way?|Are you...
{12800}{12853}Did you cut your hair or something?|You look fabulous.
{12859}{12953}I mean, you look like a Fate|worse than death.
{12962}{13003}Oh, gross!
{13009}{13096}Yech! It's blinkin'!
{13108}{13195}Ladies, please.|My fate...
{13201}{13249}is in your lovely hands.
{13255}{13356}- Oh.|- Oh, all right.
{13387}{13492}In 18 years precisely...
{13498}{13555}the planets will align...
{13561}{13634}ever so nicely.
{13640}{13664}Ay, verse. Oy.
{13670}{13729}The time to act|will be at hand.
{13735}{13834}Unleash the Titans,|your monstrous band.
{13840}{13870}Mm-hmm. Good, good.
{13876}{14000}Then the once-proud Zeus|will finally fall...
{14006}{14075}and you, Hades...
{14081}{14151}will rule all!
{14157}{14216}Yes! Hades rules!
{14222}{14320}- A word of caution to this tale.|- Excuse me?
{14326}{14475}Should Hercules fight,|you will fail.
{14553}{14603}What?
{14609}{14712}Okay, fine, fine.|I'm cool. I'm fine.
{14716}{14798}Pain? Panic?|Got a little riddle for ya.
{14804}{14877}How do you kill a god?
{14883}{14919}I do not know!
{14925}{14962}You can't. They're immortal?
{14968}{15006}Bingo! They're immortal!
{15012}{15121}So, first you got to turn|the little sunspot...
{15127}{15209}mortal.
{15860}{15918}- Huh?|- Wha... What is it?
{15924}{16005}The baby!
{16101}{16236}Hercules! Oh!
{16256}{16389}No!
{16395}{16427}Now we did it!
{16433}{16481}Zeus is gonna use us|for target practice!
{16487}{16576}Just hang on to the kid, Panic!
{16633}{16705}Hurry! Let's just kill the kid|and get it over with, okay?
{16711}{16824}Here you go, kid.|A little Grecian formula.
{16825}{16915}Look at that! He's changing.|Can we do it now?
{16921}{16994}No, no, no. He has to drink|the whole potion.
{17000}{17112}- Every last drop!|- Who's there?
{17209}{17283}Alcmene, over here.
{17289}{17358}Oh, you poor thing.
{17364}{17407}- Oh, don't cry.|- Is anybody there?
{17413}{17491}- Now?|- Now.
{17497}{17571}Oh. Well, he must|have been abandoned.
{17577}{17635}Amphitryon, for so many years...
{17641}{17717}we've prayed to the gods|to bless us with a child.
{17723}{17775}Perhaps they've answered|our prayers.
{17781}{17815}Perhaps they have.
{17821}{17904}"Hercules"?
{18337}{18386}Help, help, help!
{18392}{18444}Hades is gonna kill us|when he finds out what happened.
{18450}{18510}You mean, if he finds out.
{18516}{18571}Of course he's gonna f...
{18577}{18666}If. If is good.
{18672}{18782}It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods|on a frantic search.
{18788}{18879}But by the time they found the baby,|it was too late.
{18885}{18994}{y:i}- Young Herc was mortal now|{y:i}- Mmm
{19000}{19083}{y:i}But since he did not drink|{y:i}the last drop
{19089}{19161}{y:i}He still retained|{y:i}his godlike strength
{19167}{19274}{y:i}- So thank his lucky stars|- Tell it, girl.
{19280}{19394}{y:i}- But Zeus and Hera wept|{y:i}- Ooh, ooh, ooh
{19400}{19485}{y:i}Because their son|{y:i}could never come home
{19491}{19551}{y:i}They'd have to watch|{y:i}their precious baby
{19557}{19650}{y:i}Grow up from afar
{19656}{19772}{y:i}Though Hades'horrid plan
{19778}{19853}{y:i}Was hatched before Herc|{y:i}cut his first tooth
{19859}{19957}{y:i}- Ahh|{y:i}- The boy grew stronger every day
{19963}{20060}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{20066}{20292}{y:i}The gospel truth
{20484}{20573}Hercules, slow down!
{20627}{20677}Look out!
{20683}{20721}Oops! S-S-Sorry, guys!
{20727}{20817}- Hey, watch where you're goin'!|- Sunday driver!
{20887}{20925}Thanks, son.
{20931}{21016}When old Penelope twisted her ankle|back there, I thought we were done for.
{21022}{21097}- No problem, Pop.|- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.
{21103}{21146}First, I have to finagle|with Phideas.
{21152}{21207}Okay.
{21213}{21259}Oops. Sorry, Penelope.
{21265}{21341}Now, Hercules, this time,|please just...
{21347}{21396}I know, I know.
{21402}{21457}Stay by the cart.
{21463}{21545}That's my boy.
{21607}{21641}Oh, my goodness. Whoa!
{21647}{21709}Careful!
{21715}{21770}- Why, thank you.|- No problem.
{21776}{21853}Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!
{21859}{21944}- Let me, let me help you with that.|- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!
{21950}{21995}I'm fine.|You just run along.
{22001}{22039}- Are you sure?|- Oh, yes.
{22045}{22128}Absolutely.
{22180}{22233}Yo! Give it here!
{22239}{22308}Hey, you need an extra guy?
{22314}{22364}Uh, sorry, Herc.
{22370}{22429}Uh, we already got five...
{22435}{22475}and we want to keep it|an even number.
{22481}{22535}- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev...|- See ya, Herc.
{22541}{22602}- What a geek!|- Destructo Boy.
{22608}{22708}- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules."|- Yeah!
{22835}{22870}Heads up!
{22876}{22960}- I-I got it!|- No! Stop!
{23001}{23099}Uh-oh. Oh, no.
{23105}{23180}It's okay.
{23311}{23396}Hey! Whoa!
{23499}{23567}- Son!|- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!
{23573}{23639}Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!|Oh, no, no, no, no!
{23645}{23742}No, no, no, no, no, no!
{23836}{23914}Watch out!
{24244}{24322}Nice catch, Jerkules.
{24328}{24392}Son.
{24398}{24515}This is the last straw,|Amphitryon!
{24521}{24555}That boy is a menace!
{24561}{24668}He's too dangerous|to be around normal people!
{24668}{24720}He didn't mean any harm.|He's just a kid.
{24726}{24819}He-He just can't control|his strength.
{24825}{24926}I'm warning you.|You keep that-that-that...
{24932}{24968}freak away from here!
{24974}{25065}Freak! Yeah, go away!
{25348}{25447}Son, you shouldn't let those things|they said back there get to ya.
{25453}{25513}But, Pop, they're right.|I-I am a freak.
{25519}{25594}I-I try to fit in.|I really do.
{25600}{25666}I just can't.
{25672}{25752}Sometimes I feel like...
{25758}{25821}like I really|don't belong here...
{25827}{25940}like I'm supposed to be|someplace else.
{25946}{25993}Hercules, son...
{25999}{26081}I know it doesn't make any sense.
{26305}{26366}{y:i}I have often dreamed
{26372}{26423}{y:i}Of a far-off place
{26429}{26559}{y:i}Where a great, warm welcome|{y:i}will be waiting for me
{26565}{26615}{y:i}Where the crowds will cheer
{26621}{26682}{y:i}When they see my face
{26688}{26843}{y:i}And a voice keeps sayin'|{y:i}this is where I'm meant to be
{26849}{26911}{y:i}I will find my way
{26917}{26963}{y:i}I can go the distance
{26969}{27038}{y:i}I'll be there someday
{27044}{27096}{y:i}If I can be strong
{27102}{27158}{y:i}I know every mile
{27164}{27255}{y:i}Will be worth my while
{27261}{27422}{y:i}I would go most anywhere|{y:i}to feel like I
{27428}{27565}{y:i}Belong
{27608}{27678}Hercules, there's something|your mother and I...
{27684}{27771}have been meaning to, to tell ya.
{27777}{27871}But if you found me,|then where did I come from?
{27877}{27933}Why was I left here?
{27939}{28086}This was around your neck|when we found you.
{28104}{28148}It's the symbol of the gods.
{28154}{28237}This is it! Don't you see?|Maybe they have the answers.
{28243}{28332}I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...
{28358}{28436}Ma, Pop...
{28442}{28548}you're the greatest parents|anyone could have, but...
{28554}{28636}I-I gotta know.
{29046}{29109}{y:i}I am on my way
{29115}{29161}{y:i}I can go the distance
{29167}{29227}{y:i}I don't care how far
{29233}{29285}{y:i}Somehow, I'll be strong
{29291}{29343}{y:i}I know every mile
{29349}{29432}{y:i}Will be worth my while
{29438}{29506}{y:i}I would go most anywhere
{29512}{29690}{y:i}To find where I belong
{30111}{30158}Oh, mighty Zeus...
{30164}{30263}please, hear me|and, and answer my prayer.
{30269}{30341}I need to know:|Who am I?
{30347}{30444}Wh-Where do I belong?
{30552}{30635}Huh?
{30724}{30869}My boy.|My little Hercules.
{30900}{30951}Hey, hey, hey.|Hold on, kiddo!
{30957}{31008}What's your hurry?|After all these years...
{31014}{31095}is this the kind of hello|you give your father?
{31101}{31137}F-F-Father?
{31143}{31212}Didn't know you had|a famous father, did you?
{31218}{31284}Surprise!
{31290}{31336}Look how you've grown.
{31342}{31403}Why, you've got your mother's|beautiful eyes...
{31409}{31458}and my strong chin.
{31464}{31530}- Hah!|- I-I don't understand.
{31536}{31627}If you're my father,|that would make me a...
{31633}{31664}A god.
{31670}{31728}A god. A god!
{31734}{31791}Hey, you wanted answers,|and by thunder...
{31797}{31857}you're old enough now|to know the truth.
{31863}{31947}But why did you leave me on Earth?|Didn't you want me?
{31953}{32061}Of course we did. Your mother and I|loved you with all our hearts.
{32067}{32150}But someone stole you from us|and turned you mortal...
{32156}{32232}and only gods|can live on Mount Olympus.
{32238}{32271}And you can't do a thing?
{32277}{32322}I can't, Hercules,|but you can.
{32328}{32398}R-Really? W-What?|I'll do anything.
{32404}{32479}Hercules, if you can prove yourself|a true hero on Earth...
{32485}{32530}your godhood|will be restored.
{32536}{32602}A true hero. Great!
{32608}{32688}Uh, exactly how do you become|a true hero?
{32694}{32797}First, you must seek out Philoctetes,|the trainer of heroes.
{32803}{32868}Seek out Philoctetes.|Right. I'll...
{32874}{32922}- Whoa!|- Whoa! Hold your horses!
{32928}{33010}Which reminds me.
{33119}{33194}Ha-ha! You probably|don't remember Pegasus...
{33200}{33300}but you two go way back, son.
{33450}{33495}Oh, Pegasus!
{33501}{33545}He's a magnificent horse...
{33551}{33647}with the brain of a bird.
{33672}{33740}I'll find Philoctetes,|become a true hero!
{33746}{33774}That's the spirit!
{33780}{33881}I won't let you down, Father!|Yee-hah!
{33887}{33974}Good luck, son.
{34006}{34061}{y:i}I will beat the odds
{34067}{34109}{y:i}I can go the distance
{34115}{34167}{y:i}I will face the world
{34173}{34218}{y:i}Fearless, proud and strong
{34224}{34276}{y:i}I will please the gods
{34282}{34324}{y:i}I can go the distance
{34330}{34387}{y:i}Till I find my hero's welcome
{34393}{34466}{y:i}Right where I
{34472}{34813}{y:i}Belong
{35313}{35390}Whoa!
{35404}{35498}Y-You sure|this is the right place?
{35730}{35772}W-What's the matter, little guy?|You stuck?
{35778}{35876}- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!|- Ugh!
{35882}{35940}Girls! Stop! Stop!|Come back! Come back, come back!
{35946}{36015}Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!
{36021}{36106}Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!|Oh, nymphs!
{36112}{36214}- They can't keep their hands off me.|- Hey!
{36277}{36324}What's the matter?|You never seen a satyr before?
{36330}{36391}Uh, no.|Can you help us?
{36397}{36508}We're looking for someone|called Philoctetes.
{36514}{36556}- Call me Phil.|- Phil!
{36562}{36616}- Ow!|- Boy, am I glad to meet you!
{36622}{36735}I'm Hercules,|and this is Pegasus.
{36740}{36801}Animals. Disgusting.
{36807}{36922}I need your help.|I want to become a hero, a true hero.
{36930}{36978}Sorry, kid.|Can't help ya.
{36984}{37023}- Wait.|- Whoo!
{37029}{37073}Uh, sorry. Why not?
{37079}{37186}Two words: I am retired.
{37192}{37231}Look, I gotta do this.
{37237}{37279}Haven't you ever had a dream...
{37285}{37385}something you wanted so bad|you'd do anything?
{37413}{37528}Kid, come inside.|I want to show you somethin'.
{37694}{37763}Watch it! That was part|of the mast of the "Argo".
{37769}{37806}- The "Argo"?|- Yeah.
{37812}{37894}Who do you think taught Jason|how to sail? Cleopatra?
{37900}{37956}I trained|all those would-be heroes.
{37962}{38074}Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.|A lot of "yeuseus".
{38080}{38138}And every single one|of those bums let me down...
{38144}{38184}flatter than a discus.
{38190}{38258}None of'em|could go the distance.
{38264}{38329}And then there was Achilles.
{38335}{38377}Now there was a guy|who had it all...
{38383}{38425}the build, the foot speed.
{38431}{38475}He could jab.|He could take a hit.
{38481}{38536}He could keep on comin'.
{38542}{38601}But that "furshlugginer"|heel of his!
{38607}{38760}He barely gets nicked there once|and kaboom! He's history.
{38776}{38813}Yeah, I had a dream once.
{38819}{38898}I dreamed I was gonna train|the greatest hero there ever was.
{38904}{39001}So great, the gods would hang|a picture of him in the stars...
{39007}{39041}all across the sky...
{39047}{39132}and people would say,|"That's Phil's boy."
{39138}{39182}That's right.
{39188}{39231}Eh, but dreams are for rookies.
{39237}{39280}A guy can only take|so much disappointment.
{39286}{39333}But I'm different|than those other guys, Phil.
{39339}{39435}I can go the distance.|Come on. I'll show ya.
{39441}{39486}Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?
{39492}{39584}Watch this.
{39628}{39672}Holy Hera.
{39678}{39756}You know, maybe if I...|No! Snap out of it!
{39762}{39809}I'm too old to get mixed up|in this stuff again.
{39815}{39853}But if I don't become|a true hero...
{39859}{39929}I'll never be able|to rejoin my father Zeus.
{39935}{40005}Hold it.|Zeus is your father, right?
{40011}{40053}Uh-huh.
{40059}{40140}Zeus, the big guy.|He's your daddy.
{40146}{40238}Mr Lightning Bolts!|Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?
{40244}{40310}Zeus!|"Once upon a time..."
{40316}{40416}- It's the truth!|- Please!
{40440}{40489}{y:i}So you wanna be a hero, kid
{40495}{40564}{y:i}Well, whoop-de-do
{40570}{40616}{y:i}I have been|{y:i}around the block before
{40622}{40675}{y:i}With blockheads just like you
{40681}{40732}{y:i}Each and every one|{y:i}a disappointment
{40738}{40819}{y:i}Pain for which|{y:i}there ain't no ointment
{40825}{40906}{y:i}So much for excuses|{y:i}Though a kid of Zeus is
{40912}{40989}{y:i}Askin'me to jump|{y:i}into the fray
{40995}{41098}{y:i}My answer is two words
{41135}{41165}Okay.
{41171}{41201}You mean you'll do it?
{41207}{41252}- You win.|- You won't be sorry, Phil.
{41258}{41310}- Oh, gods.|- So when do we start? Can we start now?
{41316}{41382}Oy, vay.
{41388}{41454}{y:i}I'd given up hope|{y:i}that someone would come
{41460}{41497}{y:i}Along
{41503}{41556}{y:i}A fella who'd ring the bell|{y:i}for once
{41562}{41611}{y:i}Not the gong
{41617}{41669}{y:i}The kind who wins trophies
{41675}{41728}{y:i}Won't settle for low fees
{41734}{41774}{y:i}At least semipro fees
{41780}{41847}{y:i}But, no|{y:i}I get the greenhorn
{41853}{41954}{y:i}I've been out to pasture, pal|{y:i}My ambition gone
{41960}{42070}{y:i}Content to spend lazy days|{y:i}and to graze my lawn
{42076}{42130}{y:i}But you need an advisor
{42136}{42188}{y:i}A satyr, but wiser
{42194}{42279}{y:i}A good merchandiser|{y:i}and... whoa
{42285}{42374}{y:i}There goes my ulcer|{y:i}I'm down to one last hope, and I hope
{42380}{42421}{y:i}It's you
{42427}{42536}{y:i}Though, kid, you're not|{y:i}exactly a dream come true
{42542}{42591}{y:i}I trained enough turkeys
{42597}{42650}- "Who never came through"|- Whoa!
{42656}{42742}{y:i}You're my one last hope|{y:i}so you'll have to do
{42748}{42835}Rule number six:|when rescuing a damsel...
{42841}{42926}always handle with care.
{42934}{43004}No!
{43010}{43114}Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!
{43129}{43181}Rule number 96:
{43187}{43234}aim!
{43240}{43289}{y:i}Demigods have faced the odds
{43295}{43346}{y:i}And ended up a mockery
{43352}{43387}{y:i}Don't believe the stories
{43393}{43471}{y:i}That you read|{y:i}on all the crockery
{43477}{43579}{y:i}To be a true hero, kid|{y:i}is a dyin' art
{43585}{43644}{y:i}Like paintin' a masterpiece
{43650}{43695}{y:i}It's a work of heart
{43701}{43751}{y:i}It takes more than sinew
{43757}{43812}{y:i}Comes down to what's in you
{43818}{43903}{y:i}You have to continue to grow
{43909}{43956}Now that's more like it!
{43962}{44018}{y:i}I'm down to one last shot
{44024}{44110}{y:i}And my last high note
{44116}{44238}{y:i}Before that blasted underworld|{y:i}gets my goat
{44244}{44284}{y:i}My dreams are on you, kid
{44290}{44338}{y:i}Go make 'em come true
{44344}{44384}{y:i}Climb that uphill slope
{44390}{44446}{y:i}Keep pushin' that envelope
{44452}{44490}{y:i}You're my one last hope
{44496}{44572}{y:i}And, kid, it's up to
{44578}{44668}{y:i}You
{44674}{44749}Yeah!
{44772}{44815}Did you see that?
{44821}{44898}Next stop, Olympus.
{44904}{44947}All right.|Just take it easy, champ.
{44953}{44999}I am ready.|I want to get off this island.
{45005}{45062}I want to see battles|and monsters.
{45068}{45110}Rescue some damsels.
{45116}{45164}You know, heroic stuff.
{45170}{45247}- Well.|- Aw, come on, Phil!
{45253}{45331}Well, okay, okay.|You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.
{45337}{45418}- We're goin' to Thebes!|- Ya-hoo!
{45424}{45484}- So what's in Thebes?|- A lot of problems.
{45490}{45600}It's a big, tough town.|Good place to start buildin' a rep.
{45626}{45661}Sounds like your basic DID...
{45667}{45772}- Hyah!|- Damsel in distress!
{45894}{45950}Not so fast, sweetheart.
{45956}{46010}I swear, Nessus.|Put me down or I'll...
{46016}{46103}Whoo!|I like 'em fiery!
{46109}{46177}Now remember, kid.|First, analyse the situation.
{46183}{46298}Don't just barrel in there|without thinking. Eh?
{46304}{46340}He's losin' points for this!
{46346}{46440}- You don't know what you're...|- Halt!
{46465}{46528}Step aside, two legs.
{46534}{46618}Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.
{46624}{46666}I'll have to ask you to release|that young...
{46672}{46736}- Keep movin', junior.|- lady.
{46742}{46825}But you... Are-Aren't you|a damsel in distress?
{46831}{46902}I'm a damsel.|I'm in distress.
{46908}{46976}I can handle this.|Have a nice day.
{46982}{47024}Uh...
{47030}{47140}Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close|to the situation to realize...
{47144}{47225}Ohhh! What are you doin'?|Get your sword!
{47231}{47380}Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15:|a hero is only as good as his weapon!
{47530}{47603}Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!|He's gotta do it on his own.
{47609}{47679}Come on, kid!|Concentrate!
{47685}{47748}Use your head!
{47754}{47828}Oh.
{47904}{47972}All right!|Not bad, kid!
{47978}{48076}Not exactly what I had in mind,|but not bad.
{48104}{48169}Oh, gee, miss.|I'm, I'm really sorry.
{48175}{48224}- Oh.|- That was dumb.
{48230}{48284}Yeah.
{48290}{48362}Excuse me.
{48458}{48531}Nice work! "Excelente".
{48537}{48584}Is Wonderboy here for real?
{48590}{48706}What are you talkin' about?|Of course he's real. Whoa!
{48712}{48820}And by the way, sweet cheeks.|I'm real too.
{48826}{48860}Ugh!
{48866}{48978}Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!
{49088}{49169}Whoa!
{49762}{49806}- How was that, Phil?|- Reign it in, rookie.
{49812}{49878}You can get away with mistakes|like those in the minor decathlons...
{49884}{49944}but this is the big leagues!
{49950}{49989}At least I beat him, didn't I?
{49995}{50076}Next time, don't let your guard down|because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!
{50082}{50143}D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.
{50149}{50254}You gotta stay focused,|and you...
{50441}{50515}Are you, uh, all right,|Miss, uh...
{50521}{50565}Megara.|My friends call me Meg.
{50571}{50613}At least they would|if I had any friends.
{50619}{50724}So did they give you a name|along with all those rippling pectorals?
{50730}{50821}Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...
{50827}{50883}- Uh, uh...|- Are you always this articulate?
{50889}{50982}Hercules. My...|My name is Hercules.
{50988}{51062}Herc... Huh.|I think I prefer Wonderboy.
{51068}{51165}So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you|get mixed up with the, uh...
{51171}{51227}Pinhead with hooves?|Well, you know how men are.
{51233}{51364}They think "No" means "Yes" and|"Get lost" means "Take me. I'm yours."
{51387}{51466}Don't worry. Shorty here|can explain it to ya later.
{51472}{51522}Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
{51528}{51593}It's been a real slice.
{51599}{51711}Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?
{51752}{51835}Uh, I don't think your pinto|likes me very much.
{51841}{51903}Pegasus? Oh, no.|Don't be silly.
{51909}{52012}He'd be more than happy to... Ow!
{52017}{52080}I'll be all right.|I'm a big tough girl.
{52086}{52175}I tie my own sandals|and everything.
{52192}{52249}Bye-bye, Wonderboy.
{52255}{52312}Bye.
{52318}{52391}She's somethin'.|Isn't she, Phil?
{52397}{52460}Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.|She's really somethin'.
{52466}{52537}A real pain in the patella!|Earth to Herc!
{52543}{52575}Come in, Herc!|Come in, Herc!
{52581}{52640}We got a job to do, remember?
{52646}{52685}Thebes is still waitin'.
{52691}{52786}Yeah. Yeah. I know.
{53023}{53064}Aw, how cute.
{53070}{53134}A couple of rodents|lookin' for a theme park.
{53140}{53179}Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
{53185}{53253}- I'm a bunny!|- A-And I'm his gopher!
{53259}{53303}Ta-dah!
{53309}{53361}I thought I smelled a rat.
{53367}{53435}- Meg.|- Speak of the devil.
{53441}{53536}Meg, my little flower, my little bird,|my little nut. Meg.
{53542}{53584}What exactly happened here?
{53590}{53652}I thought you were gonna persuade|the river guardian to join my team...
{53658}{53742}for the uprising, and here I am,|kind of river guardian-less.
{53748}{53842}I gave it my best shot, but|he made me an offer I had to refuse.
{53848}{53901}Fine. So instead of subtracting|two years from your sentence...
{53907}{53952}hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?
{53958}{54006}- Give that your best shot.|- Look. It wasn't my fault.
{54012}{54074}It was this wonderboy, Hercules.
{54080}{54160}Hercules.|Why does that name ring a bell?
{54166}{54232}I don't know.|Um, maybe we owe him money?
{54238}{54345}- What was that name again?|- Hercules.
{54351}{54394}He comes on with this big,|innocent farm boy routine...
{54400}{54443}but I could see through that|in a Peloponnesian minute.
{54449}{54540}Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name|of that kid we were supposed to...
{54546}{54623}Oh, my gods!|Run for it!
{54629}{54707}So you took care of him, huh?
{54713}{54757}Dead as a doornail.
{54763}{54829}Weren't those your exact words?
{54835}{54874}This might be|a different Hercules.
{54880}{54966}Yeah! I mean, Hercules|is a very popular name nowadays!
{54972}{55050}Remember, like, a few years ago,|every other boy was named Jason...
{55056}{55090}and the girls|were all named Brittany?
{55096}{55204}I'm about to rearrange|the cosmos...
{55210}{55287}and the one schlemiel|who can louse it up...
{55293}{55410}is waltzing around in the woods!
{55478}{55517}Wait. Wait, big guy.
{55523}{55589}- We can still cut in on his waltzing.|- That's right.
{55595}{55658}And-And at least we made him mortal.|That's a good thing.
{55664}{55694}Didn't we?
{55700}{55776}Hmm. Fortunately|for the three of you...
{55782}{55872}we still have time to correct|this rather egregious oversight.
{55878}{56003}And this time, no foul-ups.
{56033}{56095}Wow!
{56101}{56183}- Is that all one town?|- One town, a million troubles.
{56189}{56228}The one and only Thebes.
{56234}{56286}The Big Olive itself.
{56292}{56398}If you can make it there,|you can make it anywhere.
{56539}{56646}Stick with me, kid.|The city is a dangerous place.
{56652}{56739}- Look where you're goin', numbskull!|- Hey, I'm walkin' here!
{56745}{56798}See what I mean?|I'm tellin' you. Wackos.
{56804}{56881}Pita bread. Pita bread.|Get your pita bread here.
{56887}{56950}- Hey, Mack.|- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
{56956}{57000}You wanna buy a sundial?
{57006}{57052}He's not interested, all right?|Come on, kid.
{57058}{57131}The end is coming!|Can't you feel it?
{57137}{57200}Yes, yes.|Thank you for the info. Yes.
{57206}{57260}We'll ponder that for awhile.|Just stare at the sidewalk.
{57266}{57296}Come on.|Don't make eye contact.
{57302}{57383}People here are nuts. That's because|they live in a city of turmoil.
{57389}{57494}Trust me, kid. You're gonna be|just what the doctor ordered.
{57496}{57600}It was tragic!|We lost everything in the fire.
{57606}{57704}Everything|except old Snowball here.
{57710}{57771}Now were the fires|before or after the earthquake?
{57777}{57819}They were after the earthquake.|I remember.
{57825}{57858}But before the flood.
{57864}{57938}Don't even get me started|on the crime rate.
{57944}{58030}Thebes has certainly|gone downhill in a hurry.
{58036}{58073}Tell me about it.
{58079}{58124}It seems like every time|I turn around...
{58130}{58177}there's some new monster|wreakin' havoc and I...
{58183}{58296}All we need now|is a plague of locusts.
{58319}{58385}That's it!|I'm movin' to Sparta!
{58391}{58447}Excuse me.
{58453}{58491}It, uh...
{58497}{58611}seems to me that|what you folks need is a hero.
{58617}{58700}Yeah, and who are you?
{58714}{58763}I'm Hercules, and, uh...
{58769}{58851}I happen to be a hero.
{58857}{58902}- Is that so?|- A hero!
{58908}{58960}Have you ever saved|a town before?
{58966}{59018}Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...
{59024}{59080}Have you ever reversed|a natural disaster?
{59086}{59138}Well, uh, no.
{59144}{59234}Oh, listen to thi... He's just another|chariot chaser. This we need.
{59240}{59270}That's a laugh.
{59276}{59332}- Don't you pea brains get it?|- Hmm?
{59338}{59383}This kid is the genuine article.
{59389}{59488}Hey, isn't that the goat-man|who trained Achilles?
{59494}{59529}Watch it, pal.
{59535}{59640}Yeah, you're right.|Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!
{59646}{59704}Ya missed a spot!
{59710}{59758}You... I got your heel|right here!
{59764}{59815}I'll wipe that stupid grin|off your face! You...
{59821}{59888}Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil!
{59894}{59958}What are you, crazy? Sheesh.
{59964}{60048}Young man, we need|a professional hero...
{60054}{60126}not an amateur.
{60132}{60219}Well, wait. Stop!
{60301}{60350}How am I supposed|to prove myself a hero...
{60356}{60394}if nobody|will give me a chance?
{60400}{60430}You'll get your chance.
{60436}{60525}You just need some kind|of catastrophe or disaster.
{60531}{60615}Please. Help! Please!|There's been a terrible accident!
{60621}{60675}- Meg?|- Speakin' of disasters.
{60681}{60740}Wonderboy! Hercules!
{60746}{60787}- Thank goodness.|- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?
{60793}{60823}Oh! Outside of town.
{60829}{60880}Two little boys.|Th-They were playing in the gorge.
{60886}{60945}Th-There was this rock slide,|a terrible rock slide.
{60951}{61014}- They're trapped!|- Kids? Trapped?
{61020}{61055}Phil, this is great!
{61061}{61103}You're really choked up|about this, aren't ya?
{61109}{61158}- Come on!|- No, I... You don't under...
{61164}{61276}I, I have this terrible fear|of heights!
{61364}{61425}I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!
{61431}{61494}I'm way behind ya, kid.
{61500}{61572}I got a fur wedgie.
{61700}{61740}- Are you okay?|- I'll be fine.
{61746}{61794}Just get me down|before I ruin the upholstery.
{61800}{61843}Help! I can't breathe!
{61849}{61893}- Hurry!|- Get us out!
{61899}{61955}We're suffocating!
{61961}{62034}Somebody call IX-I-I!
{62040}{62077}Easy, fellas.|You'll be all right.
{62083}{62119}We can't last much longer!
{62125}{62223}Get us out before we get crushed!
{62644}{62690}- How you boys doin'?|- We're okay now.
{62696}{62781}Jeepers, mister.|You're really strong.
{62787}{62869}Well, just try to be a little|more careful next time, okay, kids?
{62875}{62982}We sure will.
{63054}{63087}Stirring performance, boys.
{63093}{63161}I was really moved.
{63167}{63222}"Jeepers, mister"?
{63228}{63301}I was going for innocence.
{63307}{63399}And, hey, two thumbs way,|way up for our leading lady.
{63405}{63452}What a dish.|What a doll.
{63458}{63524}Get outta there, ya big lug,|while ya still can.
{63530}{63578}Phil, I-I did great.
{63584}{63666}They even applauded. Sort of.
{63666}{63719}Huh! I hate|to burst your bubble, kid...
{63725}{63808}but that ain't applause.
{63932}{64014}Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?|What do you call that thing?
{64020}{64077}Two words:
{64083}{64158}am-scray!
{64193}{64316}Let's get ready to rumble!
{64452}{64502}That's it. Dance around!|Dance around!
{64508}{64586}Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!|Keep going. Come on. Come on.
{64592}{64700}Lead with your left.|Lead with your left. Your other left!
{65298}{65389}Whoa!
{65966}{66040}All right! All right!|You're bad! Okay!
{66046}{66145}See, Phil?|That... That wasn't so hard.
{66151}{66226}Kid, kid, kid.|How many horns do you see?
{66232}{66278}- Six?|- Eh, close enough.
{66284}{66367}Let's get you cleaned up.
{66432}{66584}Guys, guys, relax.|It's only halftime.
{66623}{66704}That doesn't sound good.
[CUT]
{66854}{66928}Definitely not good!
{67586}{67696}Will you forget|the head-slicing thing?
{67842}{67948}Phil, I don't think we covered this one|in basic training!
{68193}{68300}My favourite part of the game:
{68330}{68408}sudden death.
{68880}{68970}Oh. There goes another one.
{68976}{69066}Just like Achilles.
{69080}{69122}Game...
{69128}{69253}set, match.
{69288}{69376}Hmm?
{69770}{69836}Phil, you gotta admit.
{69842}{69894}That was pretty heroic.
{69900}{70041}Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!|Ya won by a landslide!
{70081}{70164}Hades mad.
{70188}{70284}Well, what do you know?
{70358}{70440}From that day forward,|our boy Hercules could do no wrong.
{70446}{70529}He was so hot,|steam looked cool.
{70535}{70609}{y:i}Oh, yeah
{70615}{70674}{y:i}Bless my soul|{y:i}Herc was on a roll

{71173}{71234}{y:i}- Zero to hero|{y:i}- Just like that
{71240}{71306}{y:i}When he smiled|{y:i}the girls went wild
{71312}{71369}{y:i}With oohs and aahs
{71375}{71440}{y:i}And they slapped his face|{y:i}on every vase
{71446}{71511}{y:i}On every "vahse"
{71517}{71576}{y:i}From appearance fees|{y:i}and royalties
{71582}{71641}{y:i}Our Herc had cash to burn
{71647}{71710}{y:i}Now nouveau riche and famous
{71716}{71797}{y:i}He could tell you|{y:i}what's a Grecian urn

{71872}{71933}{y:i}- Sweet and undefeated|{y:i}- And an awesome ten for ten
{71939}{71996}{y:i}Folks lined up|{y:i}just to watch him flex

{73561}{73681}{y:i}Now he's a hero
{73687}{73773}{y:i}Yes, indeed
{73808}{73893}Pull!
{73933}{73975}Nice shootin', Rex.
{73981}{74052}I can't believe this guy.|I throw everything I've got at him...
{74058}{74114}and it doesn't even...
{74120}{74207}What are those?
{74213}{74303}Um, I don't know.|I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.
{74309}{74395}I've got 24 hours|to get rid of this bozo...
{74401}{74528}or the entire scheme I've been setting|up for 18 years goes up in smoke...
{74534}{74696}and you are wearing|his merchandise?
{74844}{74938}Thirsty?
{75137}{75258}Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy|is hitting every curve you throw at him.
{75264}{75339}Oh, yeah.
{75345}{75414}I wonder if maybe|I haven't been throwing...
{75420}{75547}the right curves at him,|Meg, my sweet.
{75553}{75595}Don't even go there.
{75601}{75650}See, he's gotta have|a weakness...
{75656}{75705}because everybody's|got a weakness.
{75711}{75765}I mean, for what?|Pandora, it was the box thing.
{75771}{75832}For the Trojans, hey.|They bet on the wrong horse, okay?
{75838}{75900}We simply need|to find out Wonderboy's.
{75906}{75956}I've done my part.|Get your little imps...
{75962}{76003}They couldn't handle him|as a baby.
{76009}{76070}I need somebody|who can handle him as a man.
{76076}{76115}Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.
{76121}{76171}Well, you know, that's good|because that's what got you...
{76177}{76219}into this jam in the first place,|isn't it?
{76225}{76303}You sold your soul to me|to save your boyfriend's life.
{76309}{76366}And how does this creep thank you?
{76372}{76444}By running off|with some babe.
{76450}{76492}He hurt you real bad,|didn't he, Meg? Huh?
{76498}{76545}Look, I learned my lesson, okay?
{76551}{76604}Which is exactly why|I got a feelin'...
{76610}{76654}you're gonna leap|at my new offer.
{76660}{76729}You give me the key|to bringing down Wonder Breath...
{76735}{76818}and I give you the thing|that you crave most...
{76824}{76889}in the entire cosmos:
{76895}{77005}your freedom.
{77036}{77077}You should|have been there, Father.
{77083}{77128}I mangled the Minotaur...
{77134}{77195}grappled with the Gorgon.
{77201}{77258}Just like Phil told me.|I analysed the situation...
{77264}{77359}controlled my strength|and kicked.
{77380}{77462}The crowds went wild!
{77482}{77549}- Thank you. Thank you.|- Hah!
{77555}{77647}You're doing great, son.|You're doing your old man proud.
{77653}{77699}I'm glad to hear you|say that, Father.
{77705}{77757}I've been waiting|for this day a long time.
{77763}{77823}Hmm. What day is that, son?
{77829}{77900}The day I rejoin the gods.
{77906}{77986}You've done wonderfully.|You really have, my boy.
{77992}{78034}You're just not there yet.
{78040}{78128}You haven't proven yourself|a true hero.
{78134}{78211}But, Father, I've beaten every|single monster I've come up against.
{78217}{78292}I-I'm-I'm the most famous person|in all of Greece.
{78298}{78387}I'm-I-I'm an action figure!
{78393}{78454}I'm afraid being famous|isn't the same...
{78460}{78538}as being a true hero.
{78544}{78575}What more can I do?
{78581}{78655}It's something you have|to discover for yourself.
{78661}{78801}- But how can I...|- Look inside your heart.
{78801}{78884}Father, wait!
{79230}{79275}On your left|is Hercules' villa.
{79281}{79333}Our next stop|is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...
{79339}{79411}where you can pick up the great hero's|30-minute workout scroll...
{79417}{79460}"Buns of Bronze."
{79466}{79516}At 1:00, you got a meeting|with King Augeas.
{79522}{79559}He's got a problem|with his stables.
{79565}{79602}I'd advise you|not to wear your new sandals.
{79608}{79661}- Phil.|- I told you, don't move!
{79667}{79713}DGR, the Daughters|of the Greek Revolution.
{79719}{79778}- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle|from some Amazons.|- Phil.
{79784}{79893}Phil, what's the point?
{79905}{79935}That's it!
{79941}{80024}Keep your toga on, pal.
{80041}{80117}Yuck! What do you mean,|"What's the point?"
{80123}{80156}You wanna go to Olympus,|don't ya?
{80162}{80258}Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem|to be getting me anywhere.
{80264}{80326}You can't give up now.|I'm countin' on ya.
{80332}{80416}I gave this everything I had.
{80439}{80505}Listen to me, kid.|I seen 'em all.
{80511}{80606}And I am tellin' you...|and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth...
{80612}{80657}you got somethin'|I never seen before.
{80663}{80705}- Really?|- I can feel it...
{80711}{80769}right down in these stubby|bowlegs of mine.
{80775}{80884}There is nothin'|you can't do, kid.
{80889}{80935}- It's him!|- Hey, watch it!
{80941}{80970}- Watch it! Watch...|- I touched his elbow!
{80976}{81043}- Hey, girls!|- I got his sweatband!
{81049}{81100}Phil, help!
{81106}{81185}- Okay. Escape plan: beta.|- Gotcha.
{81191}{81279}- Hey! Where is he?|- There he goes! On the veranda!
{81285}{81368}Whoa!
{81684}{81762}Let's see. What could be behind|curtain number one?
{81768}{81804}Meg!
{81810}{81871}It's all right.|The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.
{81877}{81937}Gee, i-i-it's|great to see you.
{81943}{81987}I-I-I missed you.
{81993}{82049}So this is what heroes do|on their days off.
{82055}{82103}Nah. I'm no hero.
{82109}{82160}Sure ya are.|Everybody in Greece...
{82166}{82246}thinks you're the greatest thing|since they put the pocket in pita.
{82252}{82327}I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I|can't go anywhere without being mobbed.
{82333}{82390}- I mean...|- You sound like you could use a break.
{82396}{82509}Think your nanny goat would go berserk|if you played hookey this afternoon?
{82515}{82590}Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got|the rest of the day pretty much booked.
{82596}{82639}Ah, Phil, schmill.
{82645}{82704}Just follow me out the window,|round the dumbbells.
{82710}{82812}You lift up the back wall|and we're gone.
{82904}{82952}Wow. What a day.
{82958}{83002}First that restaurant by the bay.
{83008}{83087}And then that, that play,|that, that, that Oedipus thing.
{83093}{83189}Man! I thought I had problems.
{83212}{83330}- Psst! Stop foolin' around.|- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.
{83336}{83416}I didn't know that playing hookey|could be so much fun.
{83422}{83482}Yeah, neither did I.
{83488}{83564}- Thanks, Meg.|- Oh.
{83570}{83618}Don't thank me just yet.
{83624}{83680}- Oh!|- Oop. Careful.
{83686}{83730}Sorry. Weak ankles.
{83736}{83834}Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better|sit down for a while.
{83840}{83934}So, uh, do you|have any problems...
{83940}{83985}with things like this?
{83991}{84059}- Uh...|- Weak ankles, I mean.
{84065}{84130}Oh, uh, no, not really.
{84136}{84225}No weaknesses whatsoever?
{84231}{84295}- No trick knee?|- Uh...
{84301}{84399}Ruptured disks?
{84414}{84530}No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid|I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.
{84536}{84662}- Wonderboy, you are perfect.|- Thanks.
{84668}{84754}Whoops!
{84760}{84807}It looks better that way.
{84813}{84908}No, it really does.
{85032}{85080}You know, when, when I was a kid...
{85086}{85186}I, I would have given anything to be|exactly like everybody else.
{85192}{85250}You wanted to be|petty and dishonest?
{85256}{85343}- Everybody's not like that.|- Yes, they are.
{85349}{85425}- You're not like that.|- How do you know what I'm like?
{85431}{85473}All I know is...
{85479}{85638}you're the most amazing person with|weak ankles I've ever met.
{85686}{85724}Oh!
{85730}{85786}Meg, when I'm with you...
{85792}{85894}I-I don't feel so alone.
{85900}{85956}Sometimes it's better|to be alone.
{85962}{86081}- What do you mean?|- Nobody can hurt you.
{86134}{86253}Meg? I would never ever hurt you.
{86259}{86319}And I don't wanna|hurt you, so...
{86325}{86382}let's both do|ourselves a favour and...
{86388}{86501}stop this before we...
{86507}{86597}All right! Break it up!|Break it up! Party's over!
{86603}{86666}- I've been lookin' all over this town!|- Calm down, mutton man.
{86672}{86729}- It was all my fault.|- You're already on my list, sister!
{86735}{86824}So don't make it worse!
{86843}{86906}And as for you, ya bum,|you're gonna go to the stadium...
{86912}{86962}and you're gonna be put through|the workout of your life!
{86968}{87067}- Now get on the horse.|- Okay, okay.
{87073}{87175}- I'm sorry.|- Ah, he'll get over it.
{87274}{87382}Move! Move, move,|move, move, move! Move!
{87483}{87540}Hey, watch it. Watch it.|Watch it.
{87546}{87637}Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...
{87652}{87792}That's it. Next time, I drive.
{87924}{87995}Oh, what's the matter with me?

{91412}{91462}Hey, what's the buzz, huh, Meg?
{91468}{91546}What is the weak link|in Wonderboy's chain?
{91552}{91643}-Get yourself another girl. I'm through.|-I'm sorry. You mind runnin'|that by me again?
{91649}{91711}I must have had a chunk of brimstone|wedged in my ear or something.
{91717}{91815}Then read my lips! Forget it.
{91821}{91926}Meg, Meg, Meg,|my sweet deluded little minion.
{91932}{92041}Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,|but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?
{92047}{92089}I own you!
{92095}{92206}- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.|- You work for me.
{92212}{92267}That kid's gonna be|doin' laps for a month.
{92273}{92343}If I say, "Sing,"|you say, "Hey, name that tune."
{92349}{92454}If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head|on a platter," you say...
{92460}{92502}Medium or well done?
{92508}{92613}Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.|This is gonna break the kid's heart.
{92619}{92692}- I'll work on that.|- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?
{92698}{92806}That's the sound of your freedom|fluttering out the window forever.
{92812}{92902}I don't care.|I'm not gonna help you hurt him.
{92908}{93002}I can't believe you're getting|so worked up about some guy.
{93008}{93062}This one is different.|He's honest and, and he's sweet.
{93068}{93110}- Please!|- He would never do anything to hurt me.
{93116}{93228}-He's a guy.|-Besides, O Oneness, you can't beat him.
{93234}{93337}He has no weaknesses.|He's gonna...
{93343}{93425}I think he does, Meg.
{93431}{93558}I truly think he does.
{94060}{94168}- Hey, Phil, what happened to you?|- Kid, we gotta talk.
{94174}{94242}Oh, Phil, I just had|the greatest day of my life.
{94248}{94324}I, I, I can't stop thinkin'|about Meg.
{94330}{94395}- She's somethin' else.|- Kid! I'm tryin' to talk to you!
{94401}{94443}Will you come down here|and listen?
{94449}{94598}Aw, how can I come down there|when I'm feelin' so up?
{95167}{95194}Gotcha!
{95200}{95258}Ah, very nice.|What I'm tryin' to say is...
{95264}{95322}That if it wasn't for you,|I never would have met her.
{95328}{95380}Oh, I owe you big time,|little guy. I do.
{95386}{95414}Will you just knock it off|for a couple of seconds?
{95420}{95478}Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.|Keep them up there, huh?
{95484}{95552}- Phil, I got two words for ya: duck!|- Listen to me. She's...
{95558}{95593}- My dream come true?|- Not exactly.
{95599}{95642}- More beautiful than Aphrodite?|- Aside from that!
{95648}{95743}- The most wonderful...|- She's a... She's a fraud!
{95749}{95806}She's been playin' ya for a sap!
{95812}{95879}- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.|- I'm not kiddin' around.
{95885}{95927}- She...|- I know you're upset about today,|but that's no reason to...
{95933}{95986}- Kid, you're missin' the point.|- The point is, I love her.
{95992}{96029}- She don't love you.|- You're crazy.
{96035}{96078}- She nothin' but a two-timin'...|- Stop it!
{96084}{96177}- No-good, lyin', schemin'...|- Shut up!
{96244}{96327}Phil. I... Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
{96333}{96421}Okay, okay, that's it.|You won't face the truth? Fine.
{96427}{96483}Phil, wait. Where ya goin'?
{96489}{96587}I'm hoppin' the first barge outta here.|I'm goin' home.
{96593}{96642}Fine! G...
{96648}{96757}Go! I don't... I don't need you.
{96774}{96850}I thought you were gonna be|the all-time champ...
{96856}{96973}not the all-time chump.
{96980}{97086}Jeez Louise,|what got his goat, huh?
{97119}{97163}Baboom. Name is Hades,|lord of the dead.
{97169}{97214}- Hi. How ya doin'?|- Uh, not now, okay?
{97220}{97282}Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds,|and I'm a fast talker, all right?
{97288}{97350}See, I've got|this major deal in the works.|A real estate venture, if you will.
{97356}{97402}And, Herc, you little devil you.|May I call you Herc?
{97408}{97462}You seem to be constantly|getting in the way of it, huh?
{97468}{97526}- You've got the wrong guy.|- Hear me out, ya little...
{97532}{97577}Just hear me out, okay?
{97583}{97646}So I would be eternally grateful|if you would just...
{97652}{97706}take a day off from|this hero business of yours.
{97712}{97756}Jeez, I mean, monsters,|natural disasters.
{97762}{97802}- You wait a day, huh?|- You're out of your mind.
{97808}{97946}Not so fast, because, ya see,|I do have a little leverage|you might wanna know about.
{97952}{98042}- Meg!|- Don't listen, Herc...
{98048}{98096}- Let her go!|- Here's the trade-off.
{98102}{98167}You give up your strength|for about 24 hours, okay?
{98173}{98222}Say, the next 24 hours.
{98228}{98271}And Meg here is free as a bird|and safe from harm.
{98277}{98326}We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,|we carry on, we go home happy.
{98332}{98389}What do ya say? Come on.
{98395}{98437}People are... are gonna|get hurt, aren't they?
{98443}{98488}Nah! I mean, it's, you know,|it's a possibility.
{98494}{98536}It happens 'cause, you know, it's war,|but what can I tell ya?
{98542}{98585}Anyway, what do you|owe these people, huh?
{98591}{98657}Isn't Meg...|you little smoochy face you...|Isn't she more important than they are?
{98663}{98707}- Stop it!|- Isn't she?
{98713}{98774}You've gotta swear|she'll be safe from any harm.
{98780}{98824}Fine, okay.|I'll give you that one.
{98830}{98878}Meg is safe, otherwise|you get your strength right back.
{98884}{98931}Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.|Baboom. Okay? We're done.
{98937}{98979}What do you say we shake on it?
{98985}{99032}Hey, I really don't have,|like, time to bat this around.
{99038}{99081}I'm kind of on a schedule here.|I got plans for August. Okay?
{99087}{99155}I need an answer, like, now.|Going once, going twice...
{99161}{99289}- All right!|- Yes! We're there! Bam!
{99428}{99494}You may feel just a little queasy.|It's kind of natural.
{99500}{99587}Maybe you should sit down!
{99604}{99691}Now you know how it feels to be|just like everybody else.
{99697}{99777}Isn't it just peachy?
{99783}{99835}Oh! You'll love this.|One more thing.
{99841}{99902}Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
{99908}{99982}You're off the hook.|And by the way, Herc,
{99988}{100036}is she not, like,|a fabulous little actress?
{100042}{100074}- Stop it.|- What do you mean?
{100080}{100177}I mean your little chickie-poo here|was working for me all the time.
{100183}{100270}- Duh.|- You're... You're lying!
{100276}{100390}- Help!|-Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.
{100396}{100489}- Couldn't have done it without you,|sugar, sweetheart, babe.|- No! It's... It's not like that.
{100495}{100610}I didn't mean to...|I-I couldn't... I... I'm so sorry.
{100616}{100748}Our hero's a zero!|Our hero's a zero!
{100759}{100851}Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole|cosmos up there waiting for me...
{100857}{100941}with, hey, my name on it.
{100959}{101090}So much for the preliminaries,|and now on to the main event!
{101364}{101443}Brothers! Titans!
{101449}{101530}Look at you in your squalid prison!
{101536}{101653}- Who put you down there?|- Zeus!
{101659}{101715}And now that I set you free...
{101721}{101802}what is the first thing|you are going to do?
{101808}{101935}- Destroy him!|- Good answer.
{101957}{102096}Crush Zeus!
{102119}{102236}Freeze him!
{102304}{102381}Melt Zeus!
{102387}{102531}Blow him away!
{102561}{102665}Zeus!
{102671}{102709}- Uh, guys?|- Huh?
{102715}{102779}Olympus would be that way.
{102785}{102881}- Zeus!|- Freeze him!
{102887}{102929}- Hold it, bright eye.|- Huh?
{102935}{103047}I have a special job for you,|my optic friend.
{103188}{103273}- Huh? Huh?|- Destroy Zeus!
{103279}{103367}Oh, we're in trouble!|Oh, big trouble! I gotta...
{103373}{103426}My lord and lady,|the Titans have escaped.
{103432}{103475}And they're practically|at our gates!
{103481}{103576}Sound the alarm!|Launch an immediate counterattack!
{103582}{103682}- Go! Go!|- Gone, babe.
{103705}{103795}Huh?
{103872}{104033}- Charge!|- On to battle!
{104249}{104330}Ya windbag!
{104336}{104438}Boom, badda-boom!|Boom, boom!
{104486}{104577}Hercules!
{104583}{104699}Where are you?
{104703}{104770}- What can we do?|- Where is Hercules?
{104776}{104842}Yeah, Hercules will save us.
{104848}{104926}Hercules!
{104932}{105065}Come out! Face me!
{105071}{105149}Oh, what are you doing?|Without your strength, you'll be killed.
{105155}{105220}- Hercules!|- There are worse things.
{105226}{105315}- Run!|- Wait! Stop!
{105321}{105441}- Hey, look! It's Hercules.|- Thank the gods! We're saved!
{105447}{105582}So, you mighty Hercules.
{105709}{105800}- Oh!|- Oh!
{105874}{105962}Easy, horsefeathers.|Whoa! Stop twitching!
{105968}{106064}Listen.|Hercules is in trouble.
{106070}{106178}We've gotta find Phil. He's the only one|who can talk some sense into him.
{106268}{106359}Get back! Blast you!
{106420}{106547}- Ooh! Chihuahua!|- Zeus!
{106553}{106623}Come on! Hurry up!|We're shovin' off here!
{106629}{106718}Phil! Phil,|Hercules needs your help.
{106724}{106778}What does he need me for|when he's got friends like you?
{106784}{106895}- He won't listen to me.|- Good! He's finally learned somethin'.
{106901}{106998}Look, I know what I did was wrong,|but this isn't about me. It's about him.
{107004}{107082}If you don't help him now,|Phil, he'll die.
{107088}{107137}I need more thunderbolts!
{107143}{107246}Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,|my lord. Everyone's been captured.
{107252}{107377}I've been captured.|Hey, hey, watch the glasses.
{107461}{107527}Zeusy, I'm home!
{107533}{107622}Hades! You're behind this?
{107628}{107744}You're correct, sir!
{107777}{107870}Flea!
{107932}{108001}- Hercules!|- Phil.
{108007}{108082}Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.|Come on. You can take this bum.
{108088}{108203}- This guy's a pushover. Look at him.|- You were right all along, Phil.
{108209}{108288}- Dreams are for rookies.|- No, no, no, no, no, kid.
{108294}{108389}Givin' up is for rookies. I came back|'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.
{108395}{108530}I'm willin' to go the distance.|How about you?
{108553}{108660}Me bite off head!
{108720}{108831}Whoa, baby!
{109097}{109150}Hercules! Look out!
{109156}{109266}Meg! No!
{109435}{109519}What's happening?
{109525}{109610}H-Hades' deal is broken.
{109616}{109683}He promised I wouldn't get hurt.
{109689}{109809}Meg, why... why... why did ya...|You didn't have to...
{109815}{109914}Oh, people always|do crazy things...
{109920}{109978}when they're in love.
{109984}{110075}Oh, Meg. Meg, I... I...
{110081}{110234}Are you always this articulate?
{110248}{110373}You... You haven't got much time.|You can still stop Hades.
{110379}{110453}I'll watch over her, kid.
{110459}{110596}You're gonna be all right.|I promise.
{110620}{110724}Let's go, Pegasus!
{110731}{110785}Hup, two, three, four!|Come on, everybody!
{110791}{110853}- I can't hear you!|- Oh, oh, that.
{110859}{110957}I swear to you, Hades,|when I get out of th...
{110963}{111022}I'm the one giving orders now,|bolt boy.
{111028}{111091}And I think|I'm gonna like it here.
{111097}{111193}Don't get too|comfortable, Hades!
{111199}{111318}- Hercules!|- This ought to even the odds!
{111353}{111481}- Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.|- Get them!
{111520}{111567}Whoa! Hey!
{111573}{111692}No! Get him! Not me! Him!
{111709}{111860}Follow the fingers! Him!|The yutz with the horse!
{111984}{112052}- Thank you, my boy.|- Nice horsey!
{112058}{112211}My intentions were pure.|I really was attracted to you.
{112220}{112343}- Throw!|- Ah! Now watch your old man work!
{112349}{112431}Uh-oh!
{112467}{112524}Guys, get your|titanic rears in gear...
{112530}{112605}and kick some Olympian butt.
{112611}{112715}Whoa! Is my hair out?
{113308}{113410}Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least|I've got one swell consolation prize...
{113416}{113519}a friend of yours|who's dying to see me.
{113525}{113590}Meg.
{114280}{114355}Meg.
{114471}{114568}Meg, no.
{115002}{115089}Oh, I'm sorry, kid.
{115116}{115210}There's some things|you just can't change.
{115251}{115335}Yes, I can.
{115388}{115450}We were so close!
{115456}{115522}So close. We tripped|at the finish line. Why?
{115528}{115670}Because our little nut, Meg,|has to go all noble.
{115724}{115783}- Where's Meg?|- Oh. Look who's here.
{115789}{115895}- Wonderboy, you are too much.|- Let her go.
{115901}{116006}Get a grip. Come here. Come here.|Let me show you around.
{116012}{116119}Hmph. Well, well.|It's a small underworld, after all, huh?
{116125}{116213}- Meg!|- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.
{116219}{116281}You see, Meg's running|with a new crowd these days...
{116287}{116367}and not a very lively one at that.
{116373}{116450}You like making deals.|Take me in Meg's place.
{116456}{116582}Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival|trapped forever in a river of death.
{116588}{116642}- Going once!|- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?
{116648}{116717}- Going twice!|- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
{116723}{116843}You get her out.|She goes; you stay.
{116880}{116959}Oh, you know what slipped my mind?|You'll be dead before|you can get to her.
{116965}{117076}That's not a problem, is it?
{117635}{117685}Oh!
{117691}{117741}What's the matter|with these scissors?
{117747}{117844}The thread won't cut.
{117992}{118050}This is...|This is impossible!
{118056}{118122}You... You... You can't be alive.|You'd have to be a, a...
{118128}{118229}A god?
{118274}{118362}Hercules, stop!|Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't...
{118368}{118442}Fine. Okay. Listen.|Okay, well, I deserved that.
{118448}{118538}Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?|Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?
{118544}{118592}So maybe you could|put in a word with him...
{118598}{118646}and he'd kind of blow|this whole thing off, you know?
{118652}{118764}Meg, Meg, talk to him.|You know, a little schmooze, uh...
{118796}{118920}Get away from me! Don't touch me!|Get your slimy souls off me!
{118926}{118981}He's not gonna be happy|when he gets outta there.
{118987}{119058}- You mean, if he gets outta there.|- Taxi!
{119064}{119106}- If? If is good.|- Taxi!
{119112}{119237}I don't feel so good.|I-I feel a little...
{119752}{119870}Wonderboy, what...|Why did you...
{119876}{120035}People always do crazy things|when they're in love.
{120192}{120284}Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
{120532}{120590}Three cheers|for the mighty Hercules!
{120596}{120704}Oh, yeah.|Flowers for everybody! Oh!
{120935}{120982}Hercules!
{120988}{121112}Hercules, we're so proud of you.
{121118}{121200}Mother.
{121206}{121279}Fine work, my boy!|You've done it!
{121285}{121338}You're a true hero.
{121344}{121439}You were willing to give your life|to rescue this young woman.
{121445}{121533}For a true hero isn't measured|by the size of his strength...
{121539}{121626}but by the strength|of his heart.
{121632}{121745}Now, at last, my son...
{121751}{121856}you can come home.
{122134}{122279}Congratulations, Wonderboy.|You'll make one heck of a god.
{122436}{122547}Father, this is the moment|I've always dreamed of...
{122553}{122634}but...
{122640}{122754}a life without Meg,|even an immortal life...
{122760}{122866}would be empty.
{122868}{122927}I...
{122933}{122987}I wish to stay|on Earth with her.
{122993}{123095}I finally know where I belong.

"And the prince took the beautiful young girl in his arms and said, "Will you marry me?"
""Yes,"she whispered,"I will be your princess.""
Did they live happily ever after?
Of course, Elizabeth.
How do you know?
Because she was a good little girl.
If she had been naughty, the prince would have run away.
What a pile of shit.
Oh, Oharlie.
Oharles, this is really important to me.
I forgive you. OK?
I love you.
God, that hurts so much when I say it out loud.
OK, Lizzie.
Oharles, our marriage...
No, this is really important to me.
Oharles, this is really...
OK, Oharles.
Oharles...
- Lizzie, shouldn"t you be having lunch?
- This is important.
- Let me finish.
- You agreed.
You did more than agree.
It was your idea and you were right.
You were absolutely right. We can"t go on.
Sooner or later one of us has got to do something positive for once in our life for both our sakes.
- And you did it.
- I did?
- Yes.
- Wait. When was it my idea?
The best thing is for me to go and live with Annabella.
- I don"t think I said that.
- Yes.
- I did? Annabella? Is that her name?
- Yes.
Oh, God. I didn"t know that.
- All I know is what you did with her on our sofa.
- Lizzie, l"m sorry.
I couldn"t help myself.
L"ve been smitten by Annabella.
L"ve been bewitched by her.
I have been pounded flat on the anvil of love like a piece of veal with a salad on top.
Excuse me. Oan I test-drive this car?
This car looks great topless.
I think a car should represent its owner, don"t you?
Oharles, this is really important to me.
Let"s not go through all this l-never-want-to-see-you-again stuff because we will want to see each other again.
We"re not going to throw away two years, are we?
It was three years... in June.
Janie, that"s what he said. He said he wants...
He wants to move out and go live with Annabella.
I know.
If I could just be alone with him.
Yes, it"s hard to look on the bright side but...
Mm-hm.
Yes. L"ve got my car.
I guess l"ll stay in the apartment but, Janie, I really want him back.
If I could just get him alone and talk to him.
Janie?
Janie, hold on. Hold on a second.
L"m just gonna get some change.
Hey, that"s my car!
(Janie) "Elizabeth!
"Don"t spend any more money on Oharles.
Elizabeth, l"ll see you later anyway."
L"m so sorry, Your Honour.
I lost my money, my car, my husband.
All in one lunch hour?
- Yeah.
- Hey, do what I did. Plead insanity.
(Judge) Oounsel, advise your client to keep his remarks to himself.
(Woman) Sorry, Your Honour.
May we finally proceed?
Just a moment. Oould the court reporter approach the bench, please?
- L"m sorry.
- So am I.
You"re fired.
- Thank you.
- Are you OK?
Mm-hm.
Lizzie?
- Elizabeth Oronin?
- Yeah.
L"m Michael. Mickey. L"m Mickey Bunce.
Used to live down the street when we were little kids.
- Mickey. Goodness.
- Yeah!
- It"s been 20 years.
- At least.
- Do you work here?
- No.
- Neither do I.
- No. I had a divorce here.
- Divorce?
- Yes.
Ah, I don"t like that word.
You"ve got to work things through if you don"t want to get divorced.
I gave it my best shot but we"ve been separated two years now.
The good thing about it is I got to keep my daughter. That"s Natalie.
- She"s real pretty.
- She"s beautiful.
She"s a lot to handle.
She"s a lot like you used to be.
- Like me?
- Yeah.
What do you mean?
Don"t you remember what you did to my grandmother?
- I didn"t do anything to her.
- You said the same thing then.
You said that Fred did it.
Drop Dead Fred.
(Young Elizabeth) Grandma Bunce!
- Drop Dead Fred.
- I used to pretend I had an imaginary friend.
No one believed me.
Do you remember the time you and Fred came over to borrow my father"s electric shaver?
Yes.
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- Not at all.
I believed you. It was just that no one else could see him but you.
- He was so real.
- He was real all right. Really out of control.
No, not always.
Only when my mother was...
Well, you know.
Hey, we were all a little afraid of your mother.
Not Fred. No, he always stood up for me.
That"s what friends are for, even imaginary ones.
I realise you"re feeling pretty conflicted right now.
I feel awful.
I did this self-actualising workshop and they taught us that pain is your friend.
- Pain makes you interesting.
- Janie.
Look at Elvis.
Yeah, but didn"t Elvis kill himself?
Yes, but before that he was interesting.
I want you to do some affirmations with me.
- Janie.
- Just do it.
Surround yourself with light.
Are you surrounded?
Yeah, I think so.
Repeat after me.
I don"t need a man to complete my life.
- I don"t need a man to complete my life.
- L"m perfect the way that I am.
- L"m perfect the way that I am.
- I hate Oharles.
I hate Oharles.
Don"t you feel better?
No.
I love him. I really do.
(Janie) I feel basically it"s all about choice.
Since you"ve already chosen, what you may as well do is to choose what you chose.
- I heard.
- Hello, Mother.
I came as soon as I heard.
It"s a good thing l"ve got a key to this apartment.
Hello, Mrs Oronin. She"ll be all right.
She needs some nurturing. Give her a cuddle.
Ouddling is for teddy bears. L"ve packed your things. You"re coming home with me.
- L"m staying here tonight.
- Oharles is coming here later.
- I want to be here when he comes.
- Don"t disagree with your mother.
L"m staying here tonight. L"m staying here tonight.
Now that we"re home, everything is perfect.
- Don"t step on that carpet. I had it shampooed.
- Yes, Mother.
Take your things upstairs.
- I made up your bed.
- Oh.
Oh? That"s all you say to me?
- Thank you, Mother.
- That"s a good girl.
- Boo! Hello, snot face!
- Argh!
Yeugh! What happened to you? Look at you.
You"re all older. You"re even uglier.
Ugh! L"m sorry l"m going to have to be sick all over you. Lie down. Hang on.
- Where"s all the dolls?
- Drop Dead Fred.
Where is the dolls?
I want to play with the... Aha! The dolls.
Hello, Jemima. Hello, Angelique. "Hello."
You"re going to die. Ah!
Mr Pooh.
"Hello." You die, too.
"No, no, no!" Yes, yes, yes.
"My intestines. Not my intestines!"
D-E-D.
I must be dreaming.
Where"s the fire truck and the rest of the toys?
They"re gone.
L"m grown up.
- Grown up?
- Uh-huh.
Grown up?
Great.
That means there"s a load of grown-up things to smash.
Oome on!
- Where are we going?
- Play time!
Whee!
Who put that there?
I forgot to give you something.
Ha-ha-ha!
Where is it? Oome on.
There must be some here somewhere.
Ah! Here it is.
Mind your backs.
Ooh! Oareful.
L"ve got some dog poo right here.
Ã Dog poo, dog poo, lovely, lovely dog poo dog poo on the chair
Ã All along the side, all up here, lovely, lovely smelly dog poo Ã
- Elizabeth?
- Yeah, it"s me, Mother.
- L"m just getting a glass of water.
- Uh-huh.
Well, mind the carpet.
Hey, snot face, look. Ink.
Let"s write something on the carpet.
Let"s write, "Mother sucks."
No. Wait a minute. L"ve a better idea.
Let"s play a game.
- A game?
- Yeah, a game, like we used to, in the old days.
A game. OK. Great. But not dolls.
Not dolls cos we"re grown-ups now.
Not dolls. How about hide-and-seek?
Great. I love hide-and-seek.
Great. Maybe you should give me that inkwell first.
Sure. Here.
Oatch.
Nice catch. OK. Hide your eyes and count to a million.
L"m going to hide in a place where you"ll never find me. Bye-bye.
Four, five...
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh, boy.
I don"t know what to say.
- I didn"t want anybody to walk on my carpet.
- Yeah, I know.
But here I am, scrubbing away at what can only be described as dog mess.
Honestly, you"re not even back for a day and you"re behaving like a five-year-old.
Mother, do you remember when I was little
I had this friend? He was make-believe.
No.
Don"t you remember I was the only one who could see him?
No, I don"t remember Drop Dead Fred at all.
Morning.
So who"s for snot flicking?
I hid all night in the stupid garden shed and you didn"t even bother coming to look for me.
Oh, my God.
Is it? It is.
The megabitch. Let me at her!
- Is this for me?
- Get me an axe.
No, get me a chainsaw.
L"m going to slice her into tiny pieces.
Mother, are you going to be doing any gardening today?
Well, it is a lovely day for it.
The death breath.
She killed me with the death breath.
Be gone, evil one!
Hey, maybe there"s a steak in there.
We can drive it through her heart.
Brrrr!
Phew.
Uh!
My head! The megabitch squashed my head!
The bitch. She squashed my head.
The evil one reigns supreme.
There"s nothing I can do.
Aah! Phew.
Wow.
Oobwebs.
What"s so funny?
Nothing. Would you come sit here with me, Mother?
- Go away.
- You want me to go away?
All right. Fine. Say the magic words and l"ll piss off.
- Piss off.
- Gotcha. Those weren"t the magic words.
- What did you say to me?
- She told you to piss off. Are you deaf?
I said piss off but I did not say it to you.
Well, it"s no wonder Oharles left you.
You just don"t know how to make a marriage work.
You got married? You mean you"ve been doing it like the pigeons? No.
Yuck!
(Fred) There they are. Which one of you two did it?
Was it you?
Whoever taught her how to do it is going to get flattened.
(Fred shouting) There! Oome back!
She"s absolutely insane.
- Pigeon pie for you.
- Fred, stop!
So you got married.
Snot face grew up and got married.
Fred, what are you doing here?
L"m stuck cos your stupid, ugly, fat, grown-up husband has left you.
So you"re all alone and you"re all unhappy.
I had to come back and I can"t get home again until you"re happy. Why don"t you get happy?
OK.
The only thing that could make me happy would be getting Oharles back.
- All right. Let"s get Oharles back. L"ll help you.
- OK.
- You"ll help me?
- Yeah, l"ll help you.
When have you ever helped me?
- All the time. That"s what I do.
- You"ve never helped me.
- Excuse me. Yes, I have.
- Did not.
- Did so.
- You did not.
- I did.
- You did not.
- Did not, did not, did not!
- I did, I did, I did!
Right, that"s it. I hate you.
- Ow!
- Goodbye forever. I hope you die horribly.
Fred, come back.
Fred!
You don"t want me any more? Well, fine.
L"ll throw myself in front of the first... fire truck that I can see.
- Fred.
- You"re going to be sorry.
- Go ahead.
- Goodbye.
Argh!
What have I done?
Wake up.
Snot face, wake up. Wake up!
- What is it?
- It"s time to play burglars.
- Real burglars?
- Real burglars.
The kind that wear sweaters and Buster Browns. Look.
Da-da!
I made your sweater stripy.
Great.
- What is it?
- Look.
It"s a burglar bag.
Nigel. Nigel!
I think I heard something.
What are we doing this for?
Olues. OK. It"s perfect.
Let"s go. We"ll steal gold and we"ll steal silver and we"ll steal jewels and hide them where no one will ever find them, including us.
Promise?
I promise.
Let"s go, burglar.
This is very expensive.
Then we"d better be very careful.
What was that?
- OK. Oome on.
- The coast is clear.
Shh. Shh.
(Fred) Aha!
Hey, snot face. Look at this.
Eeeeeh!
Oh, no. Gladiolas.
A-A-A-chooo!
Ow!
- Are you all right, Fred?
- Yes, l"m all right.
- Hello, police?
- Are they there?
- Hello.
- Give them the address.
Tell them there"s a burglar.
OK, buddy, what shall we steal now?
- How about the telephone?
- Good idea.
- That"s probably where the diamonds are hidden.
- Yeah! Great idea.
Hello?
What"s the matter? Where"d they go?
- They"ve cut the phone line.
- Oh, my God!
Now it"s time to make our getaway through here.
Now, opening a window requires great sophisticatedliness.
- So l"d better do it, OK?
- OK.
Ha! Ouch.
I love those breaking noises.
- Oh, my God. L"m having a heart attack.
- Shh!
Shh. Shh!
OK.
- OK.
- Oome on, Fred.
Right, let"s do it.
OK, we"ll bury the treasure here and no one will find it.
Oh, mind that.
We"ve been found out.
- It"s dark in there.
- Be careful. Stay low.
Kick it in.
Ow!
(Officer) Stay down here.
- What shall we do?
- Make a run for it.
No. It"s too late for that now.
Snot face, l"m going to take the rap alone.
- No.
- Yes. Give me the guilty sweater.
No!
Snot face.
A guy"s coming up the stairs.
L"m going to ask him what he wants.
Don"t leave me.
(Nigel) Keep cool.
Argh!
Nigel, don"t die!
Right. I want you to tell them loud and clear and proud, "Drop Dead Fred did it."
- L"m no coward.
- I don"t want to.
Just do it, no brain.
- Go on.
- Drop Dead...
Drop Dead Fred...
I didn"t say it right. Fred?
Hey, I thought you weren"t a coward.
L"m not a coward. Have they gone?
Why are you taking my husband?
Lt"s a mistake. I am calling our lawyer.
- Go inside.
- Why are you going with them?
- We are pillars of the community.
- (Officer) Get a grip.
What will the neighbours think? Officer...
Maybe Mommy"s right.
I never do anything right.
So what? What are you saying that for?
You"re great. She"s not.
She"s always fighting with your dad and calling you horrible things.
Look, you"ve got to be what you want to be.
Don"t you ever be like her.
- Promise?
- Promise.
OK.
Ow!
Got you, Fred.
Hey!
Elizabeth, what are you doing?
Get dressed. We"re late.
Mother, can we talk about when I was little?
We haven"t got time. We have to get you back with Oharles and I can do it.
Let"s go.
There. You see what I mean? You look wonderful.
Now, Elizabeth, don"t worry.
All these products are cruelty-free.
No, you see, I think it should definitely be more like mine.
More blush here.
Oh, yes. Much more grown-up.
Oharles is going to love this.
Oh.
A note, Elizabeth, to you.
- It"s from Oharles.
- More bad news, no doubt.
"Dear Lizzie, I came by but no one was here so I thought l"d leave this note.
"I miss our mornings."
(Oharles) "I miss our mornings."
- You can"t go to work.
- I love you but l"ve got to go.
"The little games we used to play.
"You have the softest touch."
Ooh! Ow.
"You"re like a Lynch Bages "83, a fine wine that"s sure to age well.
"Please come home."
"L"ll wait for you at our apartment."
At last he wants to talk.
It"s more than your father did when he left.
Does he say anything else?
Just one more thing. "Love, Oharlie."
Oharles.
Oharlie.
- Shit yourself?
- God, I thought you were dead.
It takes more than a fire truck to stop Drop Dead Fred.
You have to leave. L"m expecting Oharles.
Expecting Oharles. That"s important. L"d better go.
- There"s a problem. Oharles isn"t coming.
- What do you mean?
I wrote the note.
Haven"t got a husband!
Haven"t got a husband!
Got a stupid haircut!
"Look at my horrid, stupid haircut, everybody."
Na na na-na na! Looks just like her mother.
Another little megabeast.
It was only a joke.
It was just a joke.
Snot face.
It was just a joke.
Oome on.
Hey. Look. Look.
Da da-da da-da-da da!
Want a cookie?
What"s the matter?
I really thought that Oharles wanted me back.
What"s so special about him?
I mean, can he make you puke?
- Not like you can.
- Nah.
So what, then?
- Do you really want to know, Fred?
- Yeah.
I love him.
Why?
I don"t know.
He sends me flowers and brings me wine.
He"s very romantic.
He can be really sweet sometimes.
L"ve never heard anything so disgusting in all my life.
Bleurgh! Romance?!
Bleurgh!
- Urgh! What"s this?
- Oharles"s poster for his wine-tasting party.
- Will Oharles be there?
- Yeah.
- Well, let"s go.
- No. I can"t go alone.
- L"ll come with you. L"ll be your date.
- That"s really nice but no thanks.
Janie!
Janie.
- Janie, I need your help.
- At three in the morning?
What is with your hair?
Is there a Marilyn Quayle lookalike contest?
I got this note, not from Oharles, from Drop Dead Fred.
- Who? Drop Dead?
- An imaginary friend I had as a child.
- He"s back.
- I hear you knocking but you can"t come in.
Murray is in there. You can"t stay long.
Janie, suddenly he"s everywhere and only I can see him.
He"s driving me crazy. It"s like he"s my best friend and yet l"m scared to death of him.
- I thought I was your best friend.
- You are.
- Notjust because l"m visible.
- (Man) Janie!
- Are you coming back?
- L"ll be right up, Mur.
- He"s such an animal.
- You mean he goes all night?
What do you think, he shits in the corner, he eats with his paws? You can"t stay here.
If somebody else could see Drop Dead Fred, then l"d know l"m not crazy.
Is he here now?
- No.
- Good.
I was going to say if he is, I can"t see him.
Janie, if I go home, he"s bound to be there.
You can"t stay here, though.
I can"t go home.
Oh!
- All right, stay the night.
- Thank you.
Murray is here one night a month.
You had to pick tonight.
Wake up. Look what l"ve done.
Elizabeth, wake up. Look.
Snot face, wake up.
(Fred) Wake up!
Wake up. What, are you shedding?
Did you do this to yourself?
Oh! Drop Dead Fred did it.
- He was here?
- Am I missing something?
- Is this a girly thing?
- It"s a creative visualisation.
She has an imaginary friend.
Oh. I never had imaginary friends.
Just wet dreams.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
L"m going to be at work till lunch, then l"ll be back.
That is a very strange young lady.
She"s going through a difficult time and she is a friend.
- L"m not criticising.
- You are.
- L"m just describing what I saw.
- Everybody has strange friends, even you.
- But all mine are alive.
- That"s not saying much.
Oharles!
Oharles!
Oharles!
Lt"s got to be him.
It looks just like our boat.
I think that"s him.
Pirates!
- I love playing pirates.
- Fred, don"t touch anything.
Sure. This is going to be great.
We"ll sail the seven seas.
We"ll put on eye patches.
We"ll cut off our legs and glue on wooden ones.
- I can"t touch anything?
- No. OK?
Yeah, sure. L"ll just touch that one.
- I won"t touch that one. L"ll touch that one.
- Nothing.
- I am the pirate who doesn"t touch anything.
- That"s right.
Except this one.
- What did you just touch?
- Nothing.
- What did you touch?
- The red one.
Fred!
The engine"s broken, that"s all. L"ll go and fix the engine. You keep an eye out, Oaptain.
Aye aye, Oaptain.
Fred, he"s getting away.
What? Faster?
Okey-dokey.
This way! Oaptain Fred"s in charge!
Drown the fishes! Kill all the parrots!
What is that water doing there?
- What water?
- That water.
I don"t know. What are your thoughts?
Whoa!
Man the lifeboats!
Excuse me a minute, would you?
- Now what"s happened?
- I have some bad news for you.
More?
Remember your house?
Yeah.
It... It sank.
What?
Er, I didn"t mean for it...
Drop Dead Fred just...
He was way out of control.
Do you think I have an imaginary-friend clause in my insurance?
Janie, l"m so sorry.
- Everything I own is on that boat.
- It"s all still there.
It"s just... not so near the top of the water.
You always tell me to look on the bright side of things.
What would that be in this particular situation?
There he is.
- Murray?
- No.
- Not...
- Yes.
How about the silverware service? A complete mystery to me but was completely ruined.
Any response?
He"s waving at us.
Wave or he might do something awful.
- Hi!
- What"s he doing now?
Nothing yet.
Do it to them, Murray.
I think it"s time we got down to specifics, don"t you?
Specifics, don"t you? What is it? Lt"s gone now.
He"s just sitting in your chair. Do you see him?
No, but that won"t stop me from killing the little bastard.
But we have an item we"d like for you to see.
The police report.
The damage to the room was incredible.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Hello, sweetheart.
Aren"t you a cute little thing?
L"m just going to borrow this.
L"ll be back in a second.
Snot face.
Have I got him?
What are you doing, Miss Shagrue?
L"m running for Oongress.
What does it look like l"m doing?
- There"s nobody there.
- He"s invisible, idiot.
Die! You"re dead, little man!
That"s for the boat!
That"s for ruining the one schtup I get a month when Murray"s wife is out of town!
Lt"s very hot in here, isn"t it?
This is stupid. We ought to be in a shop that sells harpoons and nets and hammers.
- What for?
- We could harpoon Oharles through the head, drag him home and hit him with the hammer till he agrees to come back.
- Harpoon him through the head?
- Brilliant.
- It"s not going to work.
- How many times have you tried it?
- We"re not five any more.
- I know.
- This would be good for the wine gala.
- It looks like a big bruise.
- L"m going to be late for lunch.
- Who are you having lunch with?
An old friend and I don"t mean you.
You"re not invited.
Why not?
We always do everything together.
(Man) Thank you.
- This is a great place.
- It"s Oharles"s favourite restaurant.
Oh.
You cut your hair.
- Yeah. Oharles is going to hate it.
- You look beautiful.
- Just relax. Let"s have a nice lunch.
- OK.
Hi. What"s happening?
Oh, no. Mickey fart pants. Who let him grow up?
- Go away.
- What?
- L"m sorry.
- No, don"t apologise.
I love being with you.
I love the way you cut your hair.
I love the way you sink houseboats.
Look at him. He"s still talking about love.
I always said you should be a girl.
You know, some people believe that you really never ever fall out of love.
Oh! This isn"t like when we were five.
We"re grown-ups now, so piss off.
L"d like to know more about the grown-up Mickey Bunce.
OK, I...
Well... I know how much you... hate the word divorce but after mine I had to get back into the whole dating... game.
- Yes, Mickey, go on.
- Yes, Mickey, go on.
OK. Erm...
See that woman over there?
Mm-hm.
Well, I dated her three or four times.
It was funny. I didn"t know whether I should hold her hand when we walked down the street or give her a kiss good night.
I felt like I was back in high school again.
Why did you do that?
- I didn"t.
- No, you did. I saw you do that.
I did, didn"t I? To get the waiter"s attention.
Well, I don"t think that works.
Maybe that does work.
Your lunch.
And your lunch, sir.
This table leg must be loose again.
Peekaboo.
Peekaboo, yeah.
I play that with Natalie all the time.
Oh, yeah...
- Smells good.
- Mm!
OK. Why did you do that?
(Woman) Disgusting!
L"m crazy.
You are crazy in the most wonderful way.
God, I wish I could be like that.
I wish I could do those kind of things.
What the hell.
(Man) Hey, buddy.
- Uh-oh!
- You don"t throw spaghetti in my restaurant.
Fine. You do it.
You and the Puttanesca woman, out of here.
I like him a lot better than I used to.
- Take it easy.
- You"re out of here.
- It was a joke. You guys should loosen up.
- Out!
- What is Puttanesca?
- My dress.
L"ll get it. L"d like to. What the hell.
Amigos.
- Having fun?
- (Waiter) Oome on, buddy.
That was great. That make you feel better?
No. First you sink Janie"s houseboat.
What you did in that restaurant.
- All you do is smash things up.
- What"s wrong with that?
Nothing, except you"re ruining my life.
Your problem is you"re no fun any more.
You"ve turned into your mother.
You are so sick. You know what?
I don"t want an imaginary friend any more.
Do you see what you"re doing to me?
L"m talking to myself.
You"re driving me crazy.
Please just get out of my life.
All right, fine, l"m going and you"re never going to see me again ever. Bye.
I asked you nicely.
Shh!
(Woman) Somebody call security.
L"m so sorry.
L"m...
You play such an expensive violin in a shopping mall?
Where? What?
L"m just getting my bag. L"m fine, Mother.
How can you say that when you have conversations with thin air?
Not thin air, Drop Dead Fred.
- Don"t mention his name.
- Sorry.
You may have Drop Dead Fred. I have Dr Ryland.
Elizabeth, please have a seat outside.
I need a word with your mother.
That"s the piece, Matthew. You"ve finished it.
L"m really sorry. I didn"t know I was going to get you into so much trouble.
So what did the doctor say?
Are you insane or what?
Did they give you a lobotomy?
He"s very good with children.
Oh.
He"s one of the country"s leading experts in dealing with the imaginary-friend syndrome.
Your child has one, too, huh?
I don"t have a child.
Oh?
- Well, who"s in there?
- My mother.
Oh!
- Which one of you is...
- Me.
- Let"s go.
- L"ll leave when I want to.
OK, fine.
OK, I was just asking. Just trying to be nice.
Go to Hell Herman! Argh!
Fred! Argh!
Punch me.
Hey, hey!
- (Twang)
- Yaah!
Hey, Fred!
- Velcro Head!
- (All) Yaah!
Brrrrrrr!
What are you doing?
I am playing with my friends.
- Hey, Freddy. Hi, guys!
- (All groan)
- Graggy.
- Hey, Fred, hold this.
That"s so Namby Pamby.
(Woman) You called?
Namby Pamby!
(All) Whoo!
This is great. The whole gang"s here.
Let"s have a sick contest!
Hey, watch this. Oharge!
Ouckoo! Ouckoo!
Oooh!
Very nice.
Nine, maybe ten. I love it.
- Not bad, huh?
- Beautiful.
Let her take these after meals and before bed.
- Are there any side effects?
- None.
They just neutralise that part of the brain which is malfunctioning.
How did it come to this?
She"s regressed to where these children are.
Elizabeth.
- Well, l"ve got to go, so l"ll see you chickens later.
- Fred. Not the pills.
Why not? Do they make you sick or stupid?
L"ll take them. L"m Fred.
You don"t want to let her take the green ones.
- Why not?
- Remember Go-Go Mouth?
Yeah.
- Don"t worry about me.
- No, no, F...
Here we are.
Now, I want you to eat all your vegetables.
- Yes.
- Yes what?
- Yes, thank you.
- That"s better.
We"re going to be great friends, Mrs Oronin.
I can see that.
L"ll be right back.
Don"t eat the napkin, dear. L"ve got a black belt and I could break you like that.
You"re going to behave.
Oonscious or unconscious, it"s all the same to me.
Whoo! I like her. She is good. She is awfully good.
L"ll be back in a moment with your pill.
"L"ll be back in a moment with your pill."
Wait a minute. Those are the... pills. This is getting serious. We"d better get out of here.
- I know, but this will take one minute.
- There"s no way anyone can see her.
- I know, cos she"s so crazy.
- Yes, crazy.
- Michael, take your foot out of my door.
- Oh...
Oome on. Snot face, let"s go.
Look, I am getting fed up of this.
It"s getting dangerous.
There"s two of them now and they"ve got pills.
They"re going to turn you into one of them.
You"ve started already.
You picked up a piece of broccoli and went,
"What a lovely piece of broccoli."
I can"t believe it. It"s beyond disgusting.
Snot face, please help.
Oome on.
Look, remember when your dad picked up the megabeast and threw her out the window?
- That never happened.
- It didn"t happen, but you wanted it to.
Yeah. So did I.
Do you remember? Hm?
Remember?
Elizabeth, you"ve made a mess of your beautiful hair.
The time has come... when we don"t want to hear the words
Drop Dead Fred ever again.
Don"t you agree, Nigel?
- Hm? About what?
- This Drop Dead Fred business.
- L"m sorry, Pol.
- Stand still. L"ll clean it later.
Oan I have some cereal?
May I have some cereal?
Yes, you may in just a minute.
We don"t eat food off the floor.
- Why do you call him Drop Dead Fred?
- Because that"s his name, Daddy.
And Drop Dead Fred is going to teach me how to cook today.
L"m going to need flour and sugar and honey and vodka.
And a pair of your pants. We"re making pants pie.
Ouch!
Vodka and pants pie. God knows what else.
She"s only a kid, Pol.
Daddy, how about we throw
Mommy out the window?
It won"t hurt her. She"ll land right in the gladiolis.
You shouldn"t say things like that about your mother.
She might cut your head off.
Very funny, Elizabeth.
Sometimes I think I don"t love you as much as I used to.
- Drop Dead Fred does.
- No more Drop Dead Fred, period!
- Hi, Fred.
- You"re completely wrong cos I don"t love you.
I don"t love anyone cos love"s for girls and girls are disgusting.
L"m a loner. L"m a crazy, wide-eyed loner on a doomed space mission to venus to battle with the three-headed megabeast.
But on the way there, I caught cornflakes disease.
Pants pie can"t save me now.
The only thing that can save me is a mud pie.
Yeah! Oome on.
Here it comes.
- Take the top off.
- OK.
- Here it comes.
- Wow, my first real mud pie!
Lt"s not ready yet. We need lots of other things.
We need cornflakes and orange juice. Beautiful.
- That"s lovely.
- This is fun.
A little tea. A lot of tea.
- Sugar?
- Yeah.
- That"s good.
- Here.
That"s good. There"s the milk. Good.
Lots of milk.
(Fred) Lovely. Right.
Yeah, but it"s not ready.
It"s still too pretty. It needs something.
I know.
There.
Great. When something"s not working, the best thing is to tear it apart to make it better.
Elizabeth, are you behaving in there?
- L"m not afraid of the megabeast.
- L"m not either.
When she comes in here, we"ll make her eat up this mud.
- And then we"ll cut her head off.
- With scissors.
- And then we"ll make her eat it.
- Make her eat her own head?
- With what?
- Oh, yeah. Well, l"ll eat her head, then.
- And l"ll eat the rest of her.
- Yeah! And then we"ll get up...
And we"ll poo her all over the table cos we"re not afraid of anything. Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Argh!
- (Mother) Elizabeth!
- Quick, hide.
Quick.
Hurry up!
OK?
Ah!
Oh, my...
What is wrong with you?
You"ve been playing with him, haven"t you?
Where is he?
Don"t take him away from me!
So that must make you cry.
Well, now I know what to do.
Give me it. No, don"t take him away from me.
- Nigel, do it.
- No, I won"t.
- I don"t want anything to do with it. It"s not right.
- All right. L"ll do it.
It"s not right.
What would you know about raising a child?
Apparently nothing.
If you ever touch this again, l"ll throw it in the trash.
Do you know what will happen?
He will be crushed to death.
"Dear Drop Dead Fred,
"you were my only friend but she took you away from me.
"I know l"ll see you again someday."
(Fred) "If you come back,
I promise we"ll run away together."
See that? "Promise."
I found that when I was hiding in the garden shed.
That"s right. That"s where I hid it.
But you never answered it.
You just disappeared.
And when you did all the... life and, um, the spirit...
- and the...
- The Fred.
Yeah, Fred. Just went out of me.
I should never have let my mother know how much she could hurt me.
Once she knew how, she knew that she could do it all the time.
And she did.
So I never showed her my real feelings again.
- So?
- So?
So now can we run away, please?
- Where to?
- To the party.
- To the Oharlie party.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Yeah!
OK?
Let"s go.
Oh, no, gladiolas.
No. No. No!
Where do you think you"re going?
L"m going.
- No, you"re not, you"re staying.
- No, Mother, this time l"m definitely going.
Good night, flake.
Yeah, well, we"re not scared of you, fatso.
Oome on. We"ll go out the window.
L"m good at this. Stand back.
Wait a minute.
I love those breaking noises.
Let"s go. Oome on.
Hey, door-to-window service.
- I brought your dress, madam.
- Mickey.
- Oan you give me a lift?
- Absolutely. Oome on.
(Fred) Oi, wait for me.
- I believe you ordered the spaghetti.
- I hate you.
Mickey, l"m so sorry.
I hope I didn"t get you into trouble.
No. Look, it"s OK. It"s all been great to me.
You"re going to look beautiful in your dress.
I hope Oharles appreciates it.
He"s just a total and utter girl, isn"t he?
This is great, stuck in a truck with two girls.
Mickey, you"re the best.
- Thanks.
- I think I was six when we moved away.
I remember getting in the car, pulling away, taking one last look at you and thinking, "l"m never going to get to have fun with Betsy again."
Mickey Bunce.
Don"t you hate it when you"re right about the wrong things?
- Let"s go.
- Thanks.
- Snot face, you are looking great.
- I am?
Yeah. For a girl.
There he is.
- Is that him?
- Mm-hm.
I thought he liked wine.
Why does he keep spitting it out?
- Where"s he gone?
- I don"t know. Oome on.
Right.
- Fred, let"s just behave ourselves.
- Sure. Not a problem.
Grapes.
Oould someone grab a hold of this?
What? Why do I always get the blame? You"ve got the grape. The lady with the grape did it.
- Where is he?
- I don"t know.
Don"t worry. L"ll find Oharlie boy for you.
Wait here. Oharlie!
Oharlie!
Oha...
No panties.
No panties! Ah!
Get up. Get up.
- Fred, get up.
- Go away!
- Get up.
- Spoilsport.
I was just admiring your dress.
The material, it"s so pretty. Slinky.
Oh!
- It"s pretty neat.
- It looks good on you.
It feels good on. I like yours. Yours is nice.
- It"s very purple.
- Annabella.
- My little Ohardonnay.
- There you are.
Elizabeth. My God.
That"s him.
Don"tjust stand there, do something.
Go on. Kiss him.
You said she was mousey.
L"m sorry. Excuse me.
Don"t go. It"s going great.
Are you OK?
- I think so.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
- My little vermentino.
- My little Pinot Noir.
I can"t believe we left the party so soon.
All that wine to spit around.
- We didn"t even get to play spin the bottle.
- I got upset.
God, you"re so stupid.
You never leave a party till the very end.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
Oinderella left early. Remember her?
No, I don"t remember her. I forgot everything about her. She made me puke.
I remember the ugly sisters. They were great.
You"re here.
- Oan I tell you something?
- What?
You look fabulous.
I do?
Darling, you need me.
I do?
To protect you.
From what?
Men like me.
- But, Oharles, there"s so many things...
- No. No talk.
Just kiss.
What was that?
Oh, it"s Fred.
Fred? What did you do, give this Fred a key?
Hey, Fred, l"m home now.
It"s Oharles, Lizzie"s husband.
Is he the violent type?
Only with me.
Jesus.
Who does this guy think he is, playing around with a married woman?
Polly, hi.
What did you do?
Hello?
You are a wonderful man, Oharles, but she is dangerous.
I love dangerous. Don"t worry.
I can take care of this Drop Dead Fred.
If you think you can handle it, here.
- But, Oharles, she is just a child.
- L"m a grown-up, Polly.
Where were we?
Eurgh! What does that taste like?
Oharles, let"s talk. It"s kind of important to me.
Of course it is.
- You"re not going to get that out, are you?
- Not now.
- Not now?
- No, I mean now.
- Now.
- Now.
Hang on.
Hang on. This isn"t how the pigeons do it. You"re supposed to stamp on her head and peck her.
- Oharles.
- Annabella.
- What?
- What?
What happened?
You just said Annabella.
- No, I didn"t.
- Yes, you did. You said, "Oh, Annabella."
- You said "Oh, Annabella."
- That"s impossible.
Oharles, I heard you. You said Annabella.
Well... if I said, "Oh, Annabella," isn"t it better that
I said, "Oh, Annabella" and I was here with you, than to say "Oh, Lizzie" and be somewhere else with Annabella?
Yeah.
I know what you"re doing. You"re going to do what he did to Annabella on the sofa.
- Don"t say things like that now, Fred.
- Lizzie.
I think it"s time to say goodbye... to your friend.
Hey. Hey!
Listen, l"m Drop Dead Fred, right?
If your husband thinks he can get rid of me with a stupid pill, he"s got another think coming.
Ow.
Well, thank you very much, dear friend.
Oharles.
Oh, you look so handsome!
- Lizzie, come on, now. Don"t do that.
- We have to do it this way.
Look, l"ve got a long day.
I don"t like him.
No. It scares me.
Go on. Out his throat.
Go on.
- What"s the news?
- Wait till my endorphins kick in.
You know, the body"s natural morphine.
Here it comes.
Ooh!
- The aerobic rush. Now ask me.
- What"s the big news?
Have you ever seen so many zeros outside of the national debt?
- I never knew a barge was worth this much?
- Not a barge. A river condominium.
I had no idea they were worth that much until mine sank.
What a total groove. You"ve got Oharles back and I have all those zeros.
Our lives have worked out!
Thank you, Drop Dead Fred.
Don"t waste your breath. L"m phasing him out.
- Really?
- Yeah.
(Oharles) What"s for dinner?
(Elizabeth) Your favourite.
(Oharles) Beef Wellington, how nice.
- To us.
- To... us.
For you, my love.
What the hell is that?
- Mud pie.
- Is that supposed to be a joke?
- Fred!
- It"s either him or me, Elizabeth.
It"s you. I swear. Fred is gone.
You know what? L"ll make a dinner salad.
- Forget it.
- L"ll make a lovely salad. Please.
It"ll be the most romantic, wonderful, romantic... romantic salad.
- A romantic dinner salad.
- Yeah. OK?
- OK.
- Here I go. L"m making it.
It"s going to be so good. If you leave those pants, l"ll take them to the dry cleaners tomorrow.
You"ll never hear from Fred again.
- He"s the wrong man for you.
- I don"t want to hear it.
You"re not happy.
- Yes, I am.
- If you"re so happy, why am I still here?
I can fix that.
No, don"t do that. Please don"t do that.
Darling...
Of course I still love you, Annabella.
Hey, l"m your fella, Annabella.
Yeah.
Snot face, come here.
- I don"t hear you.
- It"s important. He"s worse than the megabeast.
- That"s it. L"m taking the last pill.
- No.
- The goodbye pill.
- Don"t do that.
Just look in there. Please.
Annabella... Annabella, she"ll never know.
And so what if she does?
No, listen. Would you listen?
I am in control with Lizzie.
L"m in the driver"s seat.
She trusts me.
You"ve got to leave him.
I don"t feel so good.
Leave him.
I can"t.
L"m scared to be alone.
Oome with me.
- "Fred?"
- "Yeah."
- "Where are we going?"
- "Use your imagination."
- "Fred?"
- "You"ll know what to do."
"Fred?"
L"m scared.
I don"t want to be alone here.
Get in, Lizzie. I want to take you away, goose.
Don"t you love me any more?
- Hi.
- Fred.
So what are you going to do about him?
Nice job. Nice job.
Oouldn"t have done better myself.
Oome on. This way.
Ow!
We need a tree.
You"re getting good at this. Let"s go.
Just where do you think you"re going?
Just forget her. Just say the magic words.
- L"m not afraid of you.
- You can"t go in there.
L"m not afraid of you!
Finally, the magic words.
We don"t have to be afraid any more.
You have to go now.
OK. L"m ready.
- Let"s go.
- No.
You have to go alone.
- But I want you to come back with me.
- That"s just tough.
You have to go alone. I can"t get back now.
Look, you"ve got you now.
You don"t need me. Not any more.
So... goodbye.
Just kiss me and say Drop Dead Fred.
Now.
Drop Dead Fred.
What do you mean it"s no good for you this way?
Annabella, wait.
Well, to hell with you, Annabella.
Lizzie, is our romantic salad ready?
Yeah.
Bye, Oharles.
Oh!
I forgot to give you something.
Yes, Oharles. Leave everything to me. It"s Oharles.
Oharles?
Young lady, you have a lot of explaining to do.
I know what"s best for me. You have to stop treating me like l"m your enemy.
Enemy? Sometimes I wonder with you.
I made the same mistake a lot of people make.
- I had a child to save a marriage.
- How can you say that?
You made things worse. He left because of you.
What a pile of shit.
Don"t you dare. Don"t you dare walk out on me.
Elizabeth. Lizzie.
L"ll be lonely.
You should get yourself a friend.
You have a lot of options open to you right now.
I just think l"d like to be one of them. OK?
- OK.
- Daddy, it was his idea.
I wanted to play but he bumped me on the head and said piss off.
- Natalie, what did you do?
- Natalie Bunce, where are you?
Oome back in here this minute and get cleaned up.
Natalie, what happened here?
- It"s chocolate and it"s yummy. Want some?
- No, I don"t want any.
She made a terrible mess in the kitchen and expects me to believe a pretend friend did it.
He"s not pretend. He"s Drop Dead Fred.
What did you say?
She said l"m not pretend. What are you, deaf?
Natalie, now, come on. What really happened?
I told you. Don"t you believe me?
I believe you. Next time you see
Drop Dead Fred, you send him my love.
Mr Bunce.
Look out. It"s the witch. Oome on. Quick.
This is it. L"m afraid you"re going to have to find a new baby-sitter.
She"s just too much.
OK. Now.
Help! Help!
We did it. I told you it would work. Brilliant.
Help! Help! Help!
Well done.
Come, come!
Please!
Aziz. Aziz.
Aziz, light!
Aziz... light.
Good.
We start again.
"When the three planets are in eclipse... the black hole, like a door, is open.
Evil comes... spreading terror and chaos."
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.
I got all the snakes.
When is the snake act supposed to occur?
If this is the five... and this is the one... every 5,000 years.
So, I've got some time then.
You bring them water.
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.
Go with God.
Be safe from evil.
You see here these different peoples, or symbols of people... gathering the four elements of life... water, fire, earth, air... around a fifth one.
A fifth... element.
Forgive me, Lord.
They already know too much.
Father.
How are you?
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.
It's the greatest find in history.
You must be parched.
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.
It's like a battle plan.
Here the good.
Here the evil.
And here, a weapon... against evil.
I'm going to be famous.
Then let us toast to your fame.
To fame.
Salute.
You can't toast with water.
Billy, in my sack, the grappa.
This I don't understand.
This could be something... prehistoric.
I don't know.
But, wait.
Here.
Look, look.
They're here.
This man... this perfect being.
I know this is the key.
I know it.
This divine light they talk about.
What is divine light?
Aziz, light!
Much better.
Thank you.
My Lord.
Father, this is the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen.
Don't you think?
Are you German?
Lord...
I know he was about to discover everything.
But, no worry.
I was there in time.
Priest... you and those before you... have served us well.
But war is coming.
Stones not safe on Earth anymore.
This... is really amazing.
The fifth element.
Take the stones.
My Lord... if you take the weapon, we'll be defenseless... when evil returns.
In 300 years... when evil returns... so shall we.
Oh, Professor.
Professor.
Don't move!
I have a gun!
Please, understand.
They're our friends.
Friends?
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!
I'll explain everything.
- You're with them?
- Look at me.
I am your friend.
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!
Please, put... the gun down.
Billy, no!
Hurry!
The wall is closing!
Here is your mission:
Pass your knowledge to the next priest... as it was passed to you.
I will do as you command, but... hurry, you still have time.
Time not important.
Only life... important.
I will fulfill my mission!
You can count on me!
I will pass the knowledge until your return.
Anything yet?
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.
One shows a million degrees, the others minus 5,000.
Let's see it.
It's taking shape.
Send out a probe.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the President of
the Federated Territories.
On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds.
I saved this seat for you, Father.
President on the line.
We're in position.
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet.
All the calibers are overshot.
We're initiating
thermonucleatic imaging.
What you're saying is, you don't know what this is.
All we know is, it just keeps getting bigger.
Recommendation?
My philosophy is:
Shoot first and ask questions later.
I don't like uninvited guests.
All right, then.
Mr. President?
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.
I... have a different theory to offer you, sir.
You have 20 seconds.
Imagine that this... thing is not anything that can be identified... because it prefers not to be.
Wherever there is life... it brings death... because it's evil.
Absolute evil.
One more reason to shoot first.
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
Shooting will only make it stronger.
Probe will obtain objective in five seconds.
Growth rate is at 27%.
Your theory is interesting, but we don't have time to go into it.
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.
We'll protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens.
You may fire when ready.
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.
Its structure solidified on the surface.
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.
The most... terrible intelligence imaginable.
120's loaded.
The ship is in combat formation.
Missiles are loaded.
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.
I have a doubt.
I don't, Mr. President.
What happened?
Can you hear me?
What happened?
- Did you destroy it?
- I'm about to.
The planet has increased diameter by 200%.
It's moving toward the ship.
What do we have that's bigger than 240?
Nothing, sir.
Staedert, do you hear me?
Get out of there.
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?
Do you understand?
Listen.
That's an order.
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?
Get out of there!
Good God!
Four a day.
I'm tryin'.
To quit is my goal.
I'm up.
All right, I'm up.
God.
Hey, dog brain,
Finger here.
Hi, sweetie.
I love you too.
You haven't called me that
since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
I forgot...
you prefer your cat
to the real thing.
At least the cat comes back.
Still pining
for that two-timing slut?
There's millions
out there.
I don't want a million.
I just want one.
The perfect one.
It don't exist, Major.
Yeah, I know.
What?
Picture of you.
- How do I look?
- Like shit.
Must be an old picture.
Bring me your hack for a six-month overhaul.
- Negative.
- A.S.A.P.
I don't need one.
Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?
I know how you drive.
Finger, I drive a cab now... not a space fighter.
Tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?
Major, how many points?
At least 50.
Know what?
You gotta learn to lie better.
See you tonight.
Welcome to Paradise.
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.
It's Ruby Rhod,
and I'll tell you live at five...
the winner of the super green
Gemini Croquette Contest!
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.
For a perfect world.
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?
Long enough.
Give me the cash.
Is that a Z-140?
Alleviated titanium.
Neurocharged assault model.
Good thing for me it's not loaded.
It's not loaded?
You have to... push that yellow button to load it.
Take your time.
Want me to...
There you go.
Give me the cash!
That's a very dangerous gun.
Maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you.
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?
No. Take it.
I don't need it.
That's a nice hat.
You like it?
God!
Please enter your license.
Yes, just a minute.
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.
Good morning.
Sleep well? Me too.
I had a horrible nightmare.
Propulsion 2-X-4.
You have five points left
on your license.
Yeah, thank you for reminding me.
Have a nice day.
Why not?
You have 48 hours.
That's the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.
The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power... but to exterminate life.
All forms of life.
You're telling me there's nothing that can stop this.
There is only one thing.
The Mondoshawan have in their
possession the weapon to defeat evil.
Four elements... gathered around a fifth... supreme being, the ultimate warrior... created to protect life.
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."
Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe.
But, if... evil stands there...
Then what?
Then light turns to dark.
Life to death... forever.
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests permission to enter our territory.
Give it permission to enter with our warmest regards.
Thank you.
Permission to enter granted.
Show time.
We are lost.
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.
Mr. Zorg's office.
It's Aknot.
I'm so glad to hear you, Aknot.
The mission is accomplished.
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.
The attack was by two unregistered warships.
Close all borders and declare a state of general alert.
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.
Three hundred years of waiting for nothing.
Go get some rest.
No.
The Mondoshawan...
I am their contact.
They will come for me.
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.
The rescue team has reported from the crash site.
Any survivors?
Only one.
You call that a survivor?
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.
Have you identified it?
The computer went off the charts.
Normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups... which is enough for any species to perpetuate.
This has 200,000 memo groups.
Sounds like a freak of nature.
Yeah, can't wait to meet him.
You okay?
Over here.
Excuse me.
General, I want to show you something.
This is a normal human DNA chain.
You, me, anybody, right?
Watch this.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are like ours.
There's simply more of them, with infinite genetic knowledge.
Almost like this being was engineered.
Is there any danger?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
The cell is, for lack of a better word... perfect.
Go ahead.
Mr. Perfect better be polite.
Otherwise, I turn him into cat food.
Activate it.
Tissue processing.
Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection.
This is the last phase.
The cells are bombarded by atoms which forces the body to react.
That means growing skin.
Wonderful.
Reconstruction complete.
Remove the shield.
I told you.
Perfect.
Thermal bandages.
I'd... like to take a few pictures... for the archives.
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.
Activate the phonic detector.
Is that thing solid?
- Unbreakable.
- Good.
If you want out... you'll have to develop those communication skills.
General alert.
Perfect.
Ladder on 18.
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.
This way.
Lady, stay calm.
This is the police.
There's nowhere else to go.
Slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor.
Do you understand?
She doesn't.
I think we need a flying unit.
This is the police.
This is the police.
We are processing your identification.
Put your arms up
and follow our instructions.
She has no file.
She dove off.
You just had an accident.
Yes, I know I just had an accident, you daffy bastard!
You have one point left
on your license.
Look out!
Left!
I can't believe it.
Shit.
Any survivors?
Hi.
Are you okay?
Boom.
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."
Bada boom.
Big.
Big bada boom.
Big... bada big boom.
Big boom.
Yeah, big bada boom.
Bada boom.
Big boom.
Big bada boom.
You're lucky you're not dead.
This is a police control.
Please keep your hands
on the wheel.
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.
We are going
to arrest her.
Thank you for cooperating.
Sorry, honey.
Looks like this is your ride.
Open the door.
Do what they say.
Sorry.
"Please... help."
I only have one point left on my license.
I need it to get back to the garage and get the cab a six-month overhaul.
You understand?
Can you please open the passenger door?
Please... help.
I can't.
I repeat... open the passenger door.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Why not?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Help.
Finger's going to kill me.
Emergency!
Emergency!
One point has
been removed.
Yes, I know!
This is so stupid.
Assist in pursuit
of yellow cab.
Unit 47, we're on the way... after we finish lunch.
Two golden menus.
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod.
Thank you so much.
And I'm definitely too thirsty.
Look out!
We got lucky.
If they don't chase you after a mile, they don't chase you.
Maybe two miles.
Hang on.
Look, lady...
I only speak English and bad English!
Run an I.D.
I'm all for conversation, but maybe you can just shut up for a minute!
He's got a scan blocker.
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.
I don't know what you did... but they are pissed off!
Hold on!
We're safe for a while.
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.
If we get to the fog, we'll be okay.
If we make the fog.
How do they expect us to find anything in this shit?
We're just going to wait here until things quiet down if you don't mind.
Shit.
You okay?
Priest.
You don't need a priest, just a doctor.
Vito Cornelius.
What?
Priest.
Yes?
I'm looking for a priest.
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.
She's not my bride.
She's my fare.
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.
The phone book said he lived here.
Yes, that's me, but I don't know who she is.
Nobody does.
No file, no I.D., nothing.
She's got a tattoo on this arm.
Tattoo?
Fifth... element.
Finger's going to kill me.
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.
She just dropped in on me.
Started speaking a bizarre language.
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.
It's the ancient language... spoken throughout the universe before time was time.
He's a she.
You noticed that.
Yes.
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.
But gently, because this woman is... mankind's most precious possession.
She is perfect.
Perfect.
More dignified.
Hey, lady... wake up.
I shouldn't have done that.
It was wrong to kiss you.
He said to wake you gently.
You're right.
Just thought you might remember me from the cab.
Remember?
"Bada boom?"
"Big bada boom?"
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.
I drive a cab.
This is me.
Korben Dallas.
Korben.
You understand?
Here.
Take it.
You can call me when you learn English.
Just kidding.
What is your name?
You.
Korben.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.
Good.
All that's your name?
Do you have... a shorter name?
Short.
Korben Dallas.
Leeloo.
Leeloo.
Korben, Leeloo.
Leeloo, Korben.
You're sure she's a Supreme Being?
Absolutely sure.
Old friends.
Yeah, you're right.
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?
Korben Dallas.
Thank you for your help.
You've been kind, but now the girl needs to rest.
She's been on a long trip.
I know.
I was there when she landed.
Wait, wait, Father.
She said something
I didn't understand.
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?
"Never without my permission."
That's what I thought.
I shouldn't have kissed her.
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.
How about some nice Thai food?
Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Buddy, I'm waiting
all day here.
- Finger.
- Where's the cab?
Car's running fine.
Fine. What "fine"?
I know you.
"Fine"ain't in your vocabulary.
You can tell your old buddy Finger
what happened.
What? You save the planet?
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right?
I was on my way to see you, and a fare fell in my lap.
One of these big fares you can't resist.
How big?
Five-nine... blue eyes... long legs, great skin.
You know?
Perfect.
I see.
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?
Leeloo.
What's she doing?
Learning our history, the last 5,000 years that she missed.
She's been asleep for a while.
I know she's been through a lot, but we don't have much time.
You're right.
Chicken.
Good.
Chicken.
I'm really sorry to interrupt you, but... the case... with the stones... where is it?
Stolen?
Who in God's name would do such a thing?
Excuse me, sir.
The council is worried about the economy heating up.
Is it possible to fire 500,000?
I thought from a smaller company, like one of the cab companies.
Fire one million.
But 500,000...
One million.
Fine, sir.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
It's for the Supreme...
Sorry.
I didn't know your size, and I found you this makeup box.
You just put it like that.
Yes, there was a man with a limp... came here a month ago asking about the stones.
Said he was an art dealer.
What was his name?
I'm bad with names.
- They really make her...
- Perfect, I know.
What'd she say?
She says she knows
exactly where they are.
My dear Aknot, how about those two planes you borrowed?
Aknot, is that you?
What an ugly face.
It doesn't suit you.
Take it off.
That's better.
Never be ashamed of who you are.
You're warriors.
Be proud.
So what if the federal government scattered you to the wind.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Your time for revenge is at hand.
The ZF-1.
It's light. The handle's adjustable for easy carrying.
Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.
A word on fire power:
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip, with bursts of 3 to 300.
With the replay button, a Zorg invention, it's even easier.
One shot... and replay sends every following shot to the same location.
And to finish the job, all the Zorg oldies but goldies.
Rocket launcher.
Arrow launcher... with exploding or poisonous heads.
Very practical.
Net launcher.
The flamethrower.
My favorite.
And for the grand finale... the new Ice Cube System.
Four full crates... delivered right on time.
And what about you, dear Aknot?
Did you bring what I asked?
Yes.
Magnificent.
This...
This case is empty.
Empty?
Empty... the opposite of full.
This case is supposed to be full!
Anyone care to explain?
The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust.
Who took another route.
She's supposed to contact this person... in a hotel.
And she's looking for the address.
Easy.
Dot.
It's Planet Fhloston, in the Angel Constellation.
We're saved.
I'm screwed.
You asked for a case.
We brought one.
A case with four stones in it!
Not one or two or three, but four!
Four stones!
But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case?
We are warriors, not merchants.
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.
Four stones, four crates.
Zero stones, zero crates!
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!
We risked our lives.
I believe a little compensation is in order.
So you are merchants after all.
Leave him one crate for the cause.
I don't like warriors.
Narrow-minded, no subtlety... and they fight for hopeless causes, honor.
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.
I'll tell you what I do like:
A killer.
A dyed-in-the-wool killer, cold-blooded, clean and methodical.
A real killer picking up the ZF-1... would've asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun.
Bring me the priest.
I got everything we need to know about Fhloston Paradise... and a blueprint of the hotel.
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.
Flights are full, and the hotel will be guarded.
There must be a way.
I'll get it.
Weddings?
Not really.
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?
Mr. Zorg.
Jean-Baptiste...
Emmanuel...
Zorg.
It's nice to see you again, Father.
I remember you now.
The so-called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back.
Because you'll need it.
Where are the stones?
I don't know.
If I did, I wouldn't tell someone like you.
Why?
What's wrong with me?
I try to serve life.
But you only... want to destroy it.
Father... you're so wrong.
Let me explain.
Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction and chaos.
Take this empty glass.
Here it is, peaceful... boring.
But if it is... destroyed.
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.
Notice how each is useful.
What a lovely ballet ensues... so full of form and color.
Now think of all those people that created them.
Technicians, engineers. People who can feed their children tonight... so those children can grow up and have children... and so on.
Thus adding to the great chain... of life.
Water. Fruit.
You see, Father, by creating a little destruction...
I'm encouraging life.
In reality, you and I are in the same business.
Cheers.
Where's the robot to pat you on the back?
Or the engineer?
Or their children, maybe?
There, you see how all your so-called power counts for nothing?
How your entire empire of destruction comes... crashing down... all because of one, little... cherry.
You saved my life... and in return,
I'll spare yours... for now.
You're a monster, Zorg.
I know.
Torture who you have to, the President, I don't care.
Just bring me the stones.
You have one hour.
It's gobbling up all the satellites in the galaxy.
Why is it eating up all the satellites?
We're working on it.
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident but accept our apologies.
And the stones?
Did you find them?
They weren't on board.
What?
The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race.
They gave them to someone they do trust.
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.
She's singing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise.
She has the stones.
The Mondoshawans will help.
We must send someone...
to get the stones.
Excellent.
I want this operation to be as discreet as possible.
No troops.
No big operation.
I want your best man to go undercover.
I have the perfect one.
You've got a message.
Not opening it?
Could be important.
Like the last two were important.
First one was from my wife telling me she's leaving.
The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife.
That is bad luck.
Grandfather say...
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.
I bet you lunch.
Okay.
Come on.
"You are fired."
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least I won lunch.
Good philosophy.
See good in bad.
I like.
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?
Hi, Mom.
Seventeen messages.
Don't say your machine is broken again.
They last 1,000 years.
Mr. Kim, you should go.
This'll take a minute.
You don't feed your cat a croquette,
who you love more than me.
She didn't breast-feed you.
I did.
Good fortune for you.
You don't have a girl.
I'll never be a grandmother.
It bring you good luck!
My body's failing.
Take me on this trip.
What are you talking about?
You want to make me beg?
No, all I want is an explanation.
I just got in.
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.
Besides that, everything's peachy.
Thanks for asking.
Now settle down and explain this to me.
You don't know
you won a trip...
to Fhloston Paradise for two
for ten days?
I suppose you'll just leave me
on the lunar surface?
If I'd won a trip,
I'd know.
I would've been notified.
They've been blaring your name out
on the radio for an hour.
I'll call you back.
General, how nice to see you in the 5000 block.
Nice apartment.
You've settled into a wonderful life.
Heard you lost your job.
You heard that?
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.
Don't bother.
We have one for you.
"Major Dallas... you've been selected for a mission."
- What mission?
- To save the world.
"You leave for Fhloston Paradise.
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."
Any questions?
Why me? I retired six months ago. Remember?
Three reasons.
One:
As a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit... you are an expert in the use of all necessary weapons and spacecraft.
Two: You're the most highly decorated member of your unit.
The third?
Of all the members of your unit, you're the only one left alive.
Check your messages?
I've had enough good news.
Might be important.
You're a winner!
You've won the Gemini Contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.
Here are your tickets.
You rigged the contest?
Congratulations.
You couldn't be more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks.
Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife.
I am not going.
Why not?
Excuse me, General.
Who is it?
Who is it?
My wife.
You remarried?
Yes... no. I just met this girl, but I'm going to marry her.
I love her, but she hates the military.
She knows the military ruined my last marriage.
She can't have anything to do with it.
If she sees you, she'll kill me.
- Major...
- You gotta hide somewhere.
You've gotta help me.
We'd love to, but where can we hide?
We don't have time for this.
It's just for one minute.
You have no idea how much you're helping me.
No idea...
You have no idea.
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.
Major!
You're on my foot.
Major! Major!
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace...
Dallas.
We heard about your good luck and need your tickets for Fhloston.
Is this the way priests vacation?
We're on a mission.
What kind?
We have to save the world, my son.
You're gonna save the world?
Yes!
Down there.
Down there.
This is a police control.
This is not an exercise.
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?
Just stay here for one minute.
- This is a police control.
- Don't touch anything.
This is not an exercise.
Can you please spread your legs...
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.
Yeah, but I...
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.
Let's see it.
Are you classified
as human?
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.
I found him.
Mr. Korben Dallas?
Sir, can you put your hands in the yellow circles, please?
Smoke you!
Wrong answer.
The police control
is now terminated.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.
We got the guy.
Wasn't easy but we bagged him.
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.
The guy's been arrested for uranium smuggling.
All I have to do now is go to the airport, take his place... and I'll be in Fhloston in four hours.
Don't come back without the stones.
We got Korben Dallas.
Perfect.
Akanit, take command.
Go to Fhloston and get the stones.
If Zorg really wants them... he'll have to negotiate.
Revenge is at hand.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I forgot about the autowash.
There's an autowash in that shower.
I'm so sorry.
Autowash.
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.
Both times you've ended up in my arms.
It's my lucky day.
Lucky day.
Did you hear something?
Cornelius.
Autowash.
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't need your help.
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.
Autowash.
Coffee's not my specialty.
But you must drink a lot of coffee being a priest.
I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.
I'll take the mission.
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.
Good.
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.
Now David is... in great shape.
He'll protect you.
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect the stones and meet me at the temple.
Now. Yes.
Okay.
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.
The tickets.
- I.D., please.
- I'm sorry.
- There.
- In here?
Mr. Dallas?
Congratulations on the contest.
Oh, right. Okay.
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?
The garbage.
Made it!
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it... so I sent David to pick up my boarding pass.
Now David must go.
Thank you. Bye.
I am Korben Dallas.
Please report infractions
immediately to the spaceport.
And this is?
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.
Multi-pass.
She knows it's a multi-pass.
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.
Bump into each other, sparks happen...
She knows.
Anyway, we're in love.
I mean, I know she's made to be strong.
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?
- You want more?
- Yeah.
Make that two.
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.
What!
I didn't know what to do.
But this is not possible.
This is not possible.
You want some more?
This is all my fault.
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.
I know.
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.
I don't want to go to Egypt.
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?
That's me.
Just a minute, please.
It will just take one more minute.
We'll be right back.
Mr. Dallas... we really need you now.
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live and needs to interview you.
Multi-pass.
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.
Backup unit, zone 18.
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.
He's so green.
I'm sure you're excited.
I'm on vacation and don't want to be bothered.
I prefer to remain anonymous.
Korben Dallas!
Here he is! The winner of the Gemini Croquette Contest.
This boy is fuelled like fire, so start melting, ladies...
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!
The right size, the right build, the right hair, the right on.
Right on.
And he's got something to say... to those 50 billion pairs of ears out there.
Pop it, D-man.
Hi.
Unbelievable.
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.
Right here from five to seven.
You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man.
His dreams... his desires... his most intimates of intimates.
And from what I'm looking at, intimate is his middle name.
So tell me, my man... you nervous in the service?
Not really.
Freeze those knees 'cause Korben's in the place and he's on the case.
Yesterday's frog will be tomorrow's Prince... of Fhloston Paradise!
The hotel of a thousand and one follies and lollies.
A magic fountain flowing with nonstop wine, women and... hootchie-kootchie-koo... all night long.
All night long
All night
Start licking stamps, girls, because he'll have you writing home to Mama.
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.
On the trail of the sexiest man of the year: D-man, your man... my man.
End of transmission.
See you tomorrow at five.
How was it?
It was just absolutely green.
Green like what?
Crystal green.
Any kind of green you want... tree green, emerald, pond green.
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.
It must pop, pop, pop!
So tomorrow, from five to seven... please act like you have more than a two-word vocabulary.
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.
Tomorrow, from five to seven, you'll give yourself a hand.
Green?
Super green.
Dallas? Korben Dallas?
That's me.
I only have one Korben Dallas on my list, and he's checked in.
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I need to talk to someone!
I don't believe this!
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control.
I'm sorry. I'm calm.
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.
To make your flight short... flight attendants are switching on the sleep regulator... which will regulate your sleeping during the flight.
Thank you.
Hi.
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.
Good.
We are not on vacation.
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.
If I hadn't come to get you, you'd be in trouble.
Understand?
Yes.
But you, no trouble.
Me, Fifth Element.
Supreme Being.
Me protect you.
Sleep.
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.
Sleep regulator operative in zone one.
Thank you.
Are you operative?
Zone two?
Everything's ready, Captain.
What?
Assume your individual position.
But I want all positions!
Mr. Rhod...
Parasites in landing gear.
Ground, copy?
Got it.
Front gear.
Hey, man, give me some heat, man!
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!
Some heat over here, man!
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.
Take that.
Mr. Rhod!
You can call me Ruby.
Fueled and ready to go.
I'll buy you one.
Taken off already?
I'm not on the plane.
What?
The real Dallas took my place.
I don't understand.
Are you making fun of me?
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!
I never felt this way before with a human.
Really?
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.
Ground is clear.
Ready for liftoff?
Confirmed.
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.
- Power pressure?
- Primed.
- Protection?
- Confirmed
Power increase.
Ten seconds.
I am... a little... disappointed.
If there is one thing
I do not like... it is to be... disappointed.
Sorry, it will never happen again.
I know.
Liftoff.
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.
We're finally getting something.
It's sending radio wavelengths.
What does it want with radio waves?
Maybe it wants to make a call.
Zorg's office.
I told you I did not want to be disturbed.
You don't want to be disturbed except if it's Mr. Shadow... and Mr. Shadow's on the line.
It's Shadow again.
Zorg here.
Am I disturbing you?
No, no, I was just...
Where are you?
Not far now.
Good.
Good, good.
How are the stones?
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.
I'll have the four stones you asked for any time now... but it wasn't easy.
My costs have tripled.
Money is of no...
importance.
I...
want...
the stones.
The stones... will be here.
I'll see to it personally.
I will be among you...
soon.
We lost it.
We lost the signal.
Damn!
We've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.
The local time
is 3:20 p.m.
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahrenheit.
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
Parasites in the main ventilation.
Again?
I'll get it.
Have we arrived yet?
Oh, good.
We have twelve swimming pools and two on the rooftop.
All the restaurants are between levels two and ten.
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches, all accessible until 5 p. M... then the airship goes higher... to offer you a better view.
Is the Diva here?
Not yet.
Any tickets left for the opera?
You have a seat reserved, front row... next to Ruby Rhod!
He's so talented.
I love him. He's so sexy.
He has your ticket, and he'll be here in 20 minutes.
Where can I get something to wear?
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.
You miserable bastard,
I never should've pushed you out.
I was in labor for days,
and this is how you repay me?
I should've gotten
a robot.
Come on, Ma.
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan.
I need a cocktail.
Get the case in.
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.
Welcome to the...
I'm security.
Welcome to the...
Tall.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.
- What's your name?
- Fog.
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad that you are here.
She'll give you what you've come to get after the concert.
Stay here.
You're listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p.m.
Helm to 108.
Helm 108!
Helm to 108.
Time to join Ruby Rhod...
and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner...
of the Gemini Croquette contest.
Coming at you live
from Fhloston...
Paradise!
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben and the manager of this hotel... and Miss Gemini Croquette in person... and 8,000 other lucksters here... to enjoy the privilege of the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!
Now we enter what must be... the most beautiful concert hall of all the universe!
A perfect replica of an old opera house... but who cares?
To my right, a row of ministers, more sinisters than ministers.
To my left, Baby Ray, star of stage and screen.
He's not going to get much out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!
To who?
And here we have Roy Von Baker, king of laser ball.
The Emperor of KodarJaphet and his lovely daughter.
"I love to sing," she recently confessed to me.
By the way, I have a recording of her talented voice.
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time... for Korben to say the word of the day.
Tell me, my man, you happy here in the big world?
Thrilled.
And now... champagne!
Commercial!
Commercial!
Break for 30 seconds.
Show time.
I have a ship in trouble requesting permission to dock.
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.
- Permission granted for one hour.
- More than I need.
Champagne for the Diva.
I'll take it.
I found it.
Get her!
It was an ambush.
If it's war they want... it's war they'll get!
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
My compliments, little lady.
Thank you for doing the dirty work.
I couldn't have done a better job myself.
Hand over the stones.
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!
Hands up!
I know this music.
Let's change the beat.
I think we're being attacked.
They're everywhere.
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.
They got big teeth, and they got
big foreheads, and they stink.
Mangalores.
The government sent me to help you.
If somebody hears this, come and get me.
I'm in the first row.
You must give her the stones.
Who?
The Fifth Element.
The Supreme Being sent to Earth to save the universe.
Leeloo?
But she's more fragile than she seems.
She needs your help... and your love... or... she will die.
Stay with me.
Help!
If you want something done... do it yourself.
Come on, honey.
You can't die.
Wake up!
Where are the stones?
Where are the stones?
The stones.
They're not here.
The stones, where are they?
In me.
What?
Oh, my God, Korben.
Korben, another one coming.
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.
Hey, you!
I said you.
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?
I said, "one minute."
Ruby, hold this gun.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Put your hand on it.
- What do I do?
- If he moves, squeeze the trigger.
I don't feel right.
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."
I got a headache.
This ain't me.
Sorry.
Think he'll be okay?
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.
Shit. Three coming.
You guard this with your life... or you'll look like him.
You green?
Green.
Super green?
Is that your idea of a discreet operation?
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.
Move! Move!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Ladies and gentlemen... this is amazing.
Let me do it.
Oh, my God.
Korben Dallas, my man, is in trouble.
The gun!
Give me the gun.
I'm going to go... and try to see if I can see something a little closer.
Yes, the gun. Yeah.
Thanks, Ray.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!
Get up!
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!
I'm not armed.
Oh, my God.
I'm on vacation.
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.
I won a... contest.
Gemini Croquette's to...
Fhloston Paradise.
Down.
Wait a minute.
Get down!
He's trying to say something.
Down!
Sorry, my man.
Where are you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
They're coming.
They're coming.
Don't move.
What you doing?
Count to ten.
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!
I am... very disappointed.
Korben, what are you looking for?
Control room.
- This is it.
- I'll be here.
Let's go.
Quiet! Quiet!
You in charge?
How many are out there?
- I don't know.
- Let's count.
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.
Four on the right.
Two on the left.
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.
One more shot and we start killing hostages.
That's the leader.
Send someone to negotiate.
I've never negotiated.
You mind if I try?
We're sending somebody to negotiate.
Anybody else want to negotiate?
Where did he learn to negotiate like that?
I wonder.
Where's Ruby?
I thought he was dead.
Master!
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Ruby Rhod... still alive.
What's wrong with you?
It hurt!
I realize that you must be pretty mad at me... but I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is Leeloo not in trouble?
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.
Hang on.
Here, come on.
How do you get yourself into these positions?
Come on.
I'm here. It's all right.
Everything's okay now.
Listen.
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?
My man, my man, what's this thing with all these numbers?
If it was a bomb... the alarms would go off because all these hotels have bomb detectors.
This is a type "A"alert.
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.
Proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...
Stay calm!
... located in the main hallways.
Stay calm!
You know how to stop this, right?
Two minutes
to complete evacuation.
Get back!
Evacuation!
Evacuation!
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.
I know.
I don't want to die.
Please, my son.
Get in.
One minute to total evacuation.
This one.
45 seconds.
Get her strapped in.
You know how to fly this?
Like driving a cab.
How will we get out the door?
15 seconds.
10...
9, 8...
6...
5.
For the honor.
Hold on.
Like driving a cab.
It is now 7 p.m., time for the news.
See you tomorrow for a new adventure.
End of transmission.
That's the best show
I ever did.
Major Dallas has the five elements on board... and the priest is guiding them to the temple.
We're saved.
The Diva said
I should take care of you.
Humans act so strange.
What do you mean?
Everything you created... is used to destroy.
We call it human nature.
You learn that on your screen?
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."
"V" is good.
Some good words in "V."
Like what?
"Valiant."
"Vulnerable."
"Very beautiful."
Oh, of course, Munro!
Mr. President?
Now what?
We have a problem.
It's advancing?
It's not only advancing, it's moving at incredible speed.
And do you have any idea where it's heading?
Korben, there's a general on the phone.
I'll give you the President.
Major Dallas, I first would like to salute a warrior.
You're a shining example
of this army.
In the name
of the Federation...
Any idea when you'll get to the point?
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for earth...
and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.
How much time do we have?
If its speed remains constant, in an hour and 57 minutes.
I'll call you back in two hours.
Hello?
They just landed in the desert.
Good job, David.
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?
You got it figured out, Father?
This one should be fire.
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.
The four stones should go around.
The Fifth Element should be in the middle... and then the weapon against evil should work.
You've never seen this work?
Give me that.
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.
That's it.
That's it.
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!
Wind.
My man, what you doing?
- What?
- What you doing?
Trying to keep you in the D.J. Business.
Fire.
Done.
What happens?
So, now, we have to open them.
And you know how to do that.
Right?
Theoretically...
No.
Leeloo, honey, wake up.
You have to help us.
How do you open the stones?
Wind blows.
Fire burns.
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?
Rain... falls.
What does it mean?
I think that...
Maybe it's a charade.
A game or something.
If we don't get these stones open in five minutes, we're dead.
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.
Too late.
We've lost contact with them.
Three minutes.
I think mine is broken.
Why I gotta get the broke one?
We're never gonna make it.
It moved.
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.
Shut up, shut up!
Show me what you did, step-by-step.
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.
I put my hands on the top like this, and I said...
"We're not going to make it."
And that's it?
Korben, my man.
Wind.
She said, "Wind blows."
Everyone take a stone.
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!
Earth.
Open the other one.
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.
I have no matches.
Do you have any?
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?
Got some matches?
We need some fire.
We're going to die.
Don't breathe.
Fire.
One minute.
Let's go, Leeloo.
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.
Protect life... until death.
Listen to me!
Listen to me.
Listen,
I know you're very tired.
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.
But if you don't do something right now... we'll all die.
What's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?
It'll enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds.
You're right.
You're right.
There are some things... very nice things worth saving; beautiful things.
Beautiful things.
Like love?
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.
That's a good example.
Love is worth saving.
I don't know love.
I don't know love.
I was built to protect, not love.
So there's no use for me other than this.
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.
I need you.
I need you, very much.
Why?
Because... because...
Tell her, Korben.
Tell me.
Please.
Why you need me?
Because...
Tell me.
- Tell me.
- Because I...
Because I love you.
I love you.
2...
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet dead.
The planet seems to have stopped at 62 miles from impact.
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?
Every five minutes it's a bomb or something.
I'm leaving.
Mr. President.
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh who runs the center.
It's an honor, Mr. President.
Where are my two heroes?
They were so tired from their ordeal, we put them in the reactor.
I have 19 meetings after this.
Let me see if they're revived.
Thank you.
We go live in one minute.
They're... not ready.
They need... five more minutes.
You have 20 seconds.
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.
Who's that?
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.
Give it here.
Mrs. Dallas, this is the President.
On behalf of the Federation...
That doesn't
even sound like him.
The President's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.
If you don't want to talk
to your mother...
just avoid me as usual.
Boss, um...
Something happened.
What's wrong?
You'll have the item today, just like we agreed.
It's as good as in your hands.
Nothing can go wrong.
You contemptible canine!
Don't call me canine!
Do you know the meaning of patience?
Silence!
As long as dogs are involved, anything can go wrong!
I'll take that as a "no."
Jeez, what a hothead!
Ah... keep the quarter.
I am proud to present this special token...
Only in heaven can a bunch of squeaky-clean angels get awards for being extra squeaky-clean.
And now, our final honoree, voted most-rehabilitated by our heavenly jury...
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing one of those merit badges, eh, Carface?
Hey... shh!
A dog who's lifted himself up from the depths of depravity, who proves that every dog deserves a second chance...
Now I know why they call it eternity.
Everything here takes forever.
Shh! Shh!
Shh! Shh!
Charlie, show some respect.
...for making the most of what he's had to work with, this first-class, diamond-studded angel wing pin goes to...
Carface Carruthers!
What an honor! Ha.
You're too kind.
I don't know what to say!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Bless you!
I only hope that our other angels...
Who have yet to distinguish themselves...
Soon follow your shining example.
Hey, remember, Charlie, it never hurts to play the game.
Halo polisher.
Whoa! I'm late!
That feels good.
âª ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah âª
âª ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah âª
âª ah, ah âª
Ya!
Oof!
Sorry.
Lousy brake pads.
Have the newcomers touched down yet?
Uh, no, not yet.
Oof!
Put on some weight, huh, fluffy?
Check.
Check.
Move along.
Sorry, sir!
Check.
Check. Check.
Move along.
That's it.
That's all dogs.
Hold it.
Let me see that list.
There has to be more.
I'm expecting company.
Uh... Asta, Bandit, Bowser, Fido, Fifi,
Hound of Baskerville,
Pavlov Dog, Rex, Rover, Rufus,
Shatzi, Spot, and...
Itchy! Ho ho!
Oh, yeah. Right.
He's right here on the list.
Where am I?
You old fleabag, you.
Charlie, is that you?
Charlie, it is you!
Ha!
Charlie!
Gee, Itch, you shouldn't have.
Sorry, sir.
You can't take it with you.
Wait a minute.
Ain't you, uh... dead?
Oh, yeah... as a dog that eats chicken bones.
Oh, so that means...
Welcome to paradise, Itch.
Come on.
I'll show you around.
You can Mark your territory.
Hey... uh, wait!
Charlie!
âª sing âª
âª hallelujah âª
âª sing hallelujah âª oh, this is...
Well, I never would have...
Imagine... ha ha ha!
Look at this!
Hey, Charlie, wait a minute.
I'm not Itchy.
That's funny.
You sure look like him.
No, I mean...
For the first time in my life,
I don't need to scratch!
This is heaven, Itch.
Fleas go to the other place.
Hey, Bubba, how 'bout we go down to hog heaven and get us some ribs?
Ha ha ha!
Everybody's flyin'.
Uh, d-does that mean...
Me, too?
Ha ha ha.
Oh, yeah.
It's all part of the basic package.
I'm going to like it here, Charlie.
Believe me... it gets old fast.
Yeah, sure.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ya! Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Whaddaya mean?
It's hard to explain, Itch.
This joint is supposed to have everything...
To be the best, but it's just too...
I don't know...
It's... it's too...
âª it's too heavenly here âª
âª it's too peaceful and paradise-like âª
âª straight and narrow âª
âª and much too nice-like âª
âª endlessly sunny and clear âª
âª it's too heavenly here âª
âª it's too blissful to bear âª
âª calm and quiet âª
âª and much too mellow âª
âª all my brain cells âª
âª have turned to jell-o âª
âª every day feels like a year âª
âª it's too heavenly here âª ooh!
âª I need some action âª
âª I need some juice âª
âª that crazy kinda feelin' âª
âª of playin' fast and loose âª
âª some razzle dazzle âª
âª and a little stress and strife âª
âª I gotta get some life in my life âª
âª but it's too heavenly here âª
âª there's no way âª
âª you can be a sinner âª
âª roll the dice âª
âª everyone's a winner âª
âª it's so legit and sincere âª
âª it's too heavenly here âª
âª what good's a hustler âª
âª without a scam? yeah, yeah âª
âª I'm wasted talent âª
âª that's all that I am ah, ah, ah âª
âª but this operator âª
âª is at the wrong address âª
âª 'cause there's nothin' to finagle âª
âª and no one to finesse âª
âª it's so heavenly here âª
âª ahh âª
âª pure and perfect, sublime and shining âª
âª every cloud has a silver lining âª
âª everyone's full of good cheer âª
âª it's so heavenly here âª
âª they're all so saintly âª
âª I just can't relate âª
âª there's gotta be an exit âª
âª through that pearly gate âª
âª behold the canine âª
âª who's been cut down in his prime âª
âª I may have done the crime âª
âª but I can't do the time âª
âª 'cause it's too heavenly here âª
âª all hallelujahs âª
âª and hosannas âª
âª it could drive anyone bananas âª
âª I'm going out of my head âª
âª this joint is deader than dead âª
âª I'll give you 8 to 3 âª
âª it's too heavenly âª
âª hallelujah hallelujah âª
âª hallelujah hallelujah âª
âª hallelujah too heavenly here âª
Charlie, you got to see a doctor.
Heh heh heh.
Heh heh heh.
Unh! Eee! Uhh!
Hee hee!
Ooh... hey!
Ah. Ha ha ha!
Baby...
You're my ticket to fame and fortune!
Aah!
This is not good!
Aah!
Aah-ho-ho!
Aah!
Charlie, you're wrong about this place.
The flying alone is worth the price of admission.
That's perfect for you.
But for me, there's still something missing.
Ooh! Charlie, look.
Look!
Quiet, quiet, quiet, everyone!
I've got terrible news!
Oh, yeah, the flying nun.
Gabriel's horn has fallen from heaven and landed on Earth in the heart of San Francisco.
Oh! No!
This is terrible!
But without the horn, the pearly gates can't be opened.
And no more dogs would get into heaven!
Lucky dogs.
Reginald, you're our most-decorated angel.
I need you to go back to Earth go back!
To retrieve it.
Anabelle, I would consider it a great...
Whoa, time out!
You can't send Reggie.
Look at him, for heaven's sake!
They got rats down there bigger than this.
He's right!
I'll go!
We are talking the mean streets of frisco here, Ace, not mount happy-go-lucky.
Send me, Anna...
Anabelle, you'll need someone who can zip there and back before big Gabe finds his horn missing...
Someone who knows the ropes and the dopes, someone...
Just like you.
Me? Well, I don't know.
I'd have to check with my people and get back to you.
Oh, what the heck?
I'll do it.
Maybe you can do something besides make a nuisance of yourself.
Right, right.
I'll be in touch.
Hold it!
To find the horn, follow your ears.
It gives off a steady, heavenly tone that only angels can hear.
Only angels.
Got it.
Wait, wait, wait!
You're on your own.
I can give you one miracle to be used only in an emergency.
Ooh!
One per customer.
Got it.
Charles, Charles, Charles!
This is serious!
If the horn falls into the wrong hands, it could mean disaster for us all!
You can count on Charles.
Oh, just to make sure,
I'm sending Itchy along with you.
Oh, no! But...
I just got here!
Wait just a sec...
I... I still have death lag!
Whoo!
Yahoo!
I just remembered...
I have flying lessons after lunch!
Bring back the horn, Charles!
Otherwise, there'll be heaven to pay!
Got... it!
Aah! Whoo! Whoo!
Ah ha ha!
Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo!
Look at this mess, Itch.
Trash, exhaust fumes, graffiti!
We are home!
You're tellin' me!
Ha-lo!
Double chili cheeseburger with onions and pickles!
Charlie! Stay!
Look, we find Gabriel's horn and then it's straight back to heaven. OK?
What's the hurry, Itch?
Let's have some fun.
Charlie, wait!
Wiener dog, here.
Oh, my legs are short!
So let's hear it for Kiko and his jazz mongrels.
They're great, aren't they?
I.D.?
I don't need no stinkin' dog tags!
Classy place.
They check for worms.
Nice toss, big guy.
âª but fate throwed me a bone âª
âª she walked into my life âª
âª like the Princess she was âª
âª and she didn't have even âª
âª a half inch of fuzz âª
âª my pals call me crazy âª
âª but I couldn't care less âª
âª 'cause I'd fallen hard for an Afghan hairless... âª full house!
Ho ho ho!
Guess that's why they call me lucky.
All right, boys.
Name your game.
Poker, double deuce, 52-card pickup?
I'm just yanking your leash.
Hold that thought.
âª how her skin glistened âª
âª in the moonlight âª
âª and she loved my singin' âª
âª said it sounded just pretty good. âª
âª my pals called me... âª
Hey, bartender.
How about a frosty one for the Chuckmeister?
Root beer, Itch?
Yo, sparky!
Hey, what am I, invisible?
I'll just help myself!
Yee-haw!
What?
Charlie, look!
We ain't... ooh!
We're ghosts!
Anabelle!
Of all the rotten tricks!
Charles...
You've been down there for almost half an hour.
We're waiting!
Ooh hoo!
âª deedle dee hoo âª
âª deedle dodle deedle âª
âª deedle dee hoo âª thanks, jingles!
Really knocked 'em dead.
Let's have a warm round of applause for our next contestant...
Miss Sasha la Fleur.

Itch, my heart is beating a million miles an hour.
I can hardly breathe.
Maybe it was the change in altitude.
Ooh. My ears popped.
Did your ears pop?
Now I know what I was missing in heaven.
I got to meet her.
She can't see you.
You're an angel.
Quit reminding me.
Heh heh. You're back in circulation, huh, Charlie?
Oh, yeah.
My circulation's fine.
Hello, Carface.
Carface!
Ha ha ha.
I heard you was in the neighborhood.
Yeah. I got time off for good behavior.
What are you doing here?
Missionary work.
Hey. I'll take one of them.
Ha ha ha.
She can't hear you.
That'll be 2 bits, Carface.
Put it on my tab.
As long as I'm wearing this baby
I'm flesh and blood.
Where'd you get it?
A buddy of mine has them.
So, introduce us.
Charlie, you can't trust Carface.
He shouldn't have got into heaven in the first place.
My mistake.
I just thought you'd like to meet the lovely lady.
Hold it, Carface.
Hold on.
What about the horn?
Hey, we'll get it later.
Lead on, pal.
Charlie! Wait!
Short legs, short legs.
Charlie.
Charlie...
Wait for me.
How much further here, Carface?
We're... we're almost there.
Charlie?
Charlie.
Itchy, you're out of breath and the fun hasn't even started yet.
Charlie, I got a bad feeling about this.
Relax.
I got it under control.
Boys, we're here.
Heh heh heh heh.
Hey, Red!
He must be in the back.
Have a look around.
Whoo! Aah!
Ooh hoo.
Ooh hoo hoo.
Whoo aah!
Ooga booga.
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha.
You trying to scare me to death?
Don't sweat it, pal.
You're already dead.
Itch...
Come here.
I want to read your fortune.
I see you going for a long walk.
Yeah... on a short leash.
You're in the wrong seat.
Move it.
Carface...
That's no way to treat customers.
Red, I'd like you to meet a couple friends of mine.
Charlie Barkin.
Itchy Itchiford.
Welcome.
Wait, wait.
How can he...
Red sees all and knows all.
Ah... ahh... ah-choo.
You got cats around here or what?
Cats!
Oh, good heavens, no.
The boys have come to do some shopping.
Carface tells us you've got special collars.
Collars.
Oh, yes.
They're going to be the next big thing.
Here.
Enjoy.
What's the catch, old man?
No catch.
Any friend of Carface is a friend of mine.
There is one small thing.
I knew it!
We're out of here, right, Charlie?
The collars are only good until sundown tomorrow.
After that, you'll be... shall we say...
Insubstantial again.
By then I'll have Sasha begging for me.
Yeow. Hey!
Oof!
Ah. Perfect fit.
Ahh...
Ah-choo!
Feels great to be back in the flesh.
Whoa! Ooh.
How many?
Ah-choo!
Infested again.
Oh! Yeow.
Ooh, get off.
Everybody off!
And don't forget...
Sundown tomorrow.
Zzz... yetty...
Ah-choo!
Jeez.
Jeez...
Hey!
Hey, Red...
I owe you one.
You'll owe me one, all right.
They fell for it!
Ha ha ha ha ha.
When we get that horn, we can open any safe or bank vault in the world.
Ha ha!
Silence!
I didn't recruit you for such entry-level wickedness.
You have so much to learn.
âª now I know you've been malicious âª
âª spiteful, and a trifle vicious âª
âª it's no secret that you've cheated âª
âª and you've lied âª
âª and you've done some double-dealing âª
âª scheming, swindling, and stealing âª
âª you're an amateur âª
âª but heaven knows you've tried... âª
I answered your ad, didn't I?
Money, power, stature.
Call 1-800-brimstone.
Good boy.
And very soon your efforts will be rewarded.
âª you'll develop so much faster âª
âª now you're working with a master âª
âª who will help you cultivate âª
âª your darker side âª
âª you'll discover wicked ways âª
âª you've never known before âª
âª and you'll find that when âª
âª you're really rotten to the core âª
âª it feels so good to be bad âª
âª so delicious to be âª
âª a despicable cad âª
âª it's just so thrilling âª
âª and so fulfilling âª
âª to give somebody âª
âª the worst time they've ever had âª
âª it feels so good to be bad... âª
Case in point...
âª Charlie doesn't know it âª
âª but he's in my power âª
âª he's gonna wish that he was never born âª
âª I promise you that by the sunset hour âª
âª I'll have Gabriel's horn... âª
Boss, why can't I get it for you?
âª 'cause âª
âª you had your chance and blew it âª
âª I entrusted you to do it âª
âª but you bungled it âª
âª and threw your chance away âª
âª it's a problem you created âª
âª if the horn can't be located âª
âª I'm not naming names âª
âª but someone has to pay... âª
Aah!
I could try again, boss!
You'll never find it.
Only angels can hear it's heavenly tone.
But I'm an angel.
Not anymore.
You work for me now.
Aah!
âª though you gave me cause to doubt you âª
âª there's a loathsomeness about you âª
âª that attracts me to you âª
âª as a protege âª
âª and when you've learned every creepy âª
âª crummy thing I know âª
âª you'll taste the joy âª
âª that comes when you're the lowest of the low âª
âª it feels so good to be bad âª
âª so delightful âª
âª to be a deplorable cad âª
âª it's so appealing âª
âª to have the feeling âª
âª that what you're doing âª
âª gets trouble brewing âª
âª and drives everybody mad âª
âª you've got my guarantee âª
âª it feels so good âª
âª to be bad... âª
So exciting!
Ole.
So inviting.
âª so good to be bad âª bah ha!
Whoo.
âª if you got romance âª
âª on your mind âª
âª ya da ta da da âª you sing pretty good for a stray.
Can I have my prize now?
Oh. What?
You advertised a meal for the winner.
If it's a meal you want,
I'm off at 10:00.
Honey, I'd rather eat out of the garbage.
Hey, uh...
That's what I had in mind.
Huh. Bonsoir, Frenchy.
It's your lucky night.
Pedigree?
You show me yours, and I'll show you mine.
What do you serve with that shake, baby?
This is going to be fast, right?
We got a horn to find.
Ah. Take notes, Itch.
You're about to watch a master.
You must hear this all the time...
But you sing like an angel.
Excuse me.
The name's Barkin...
Charlie Barkin.
And you are?
Not even remotely interested.
Oh. That's a mouthful.
Down boy.
Let me help.
Ah, come on.
Give me that.
No, please.
It's no problem.
Whoops.
Hey, sister.
No free eats.
I'll take care of it.
Put it on Carface's tab.
OK.
Now... where were...
Hey, Charlie...
I noted how you swept the lady off her feet.
So, I'm rusty.
Let's make a little home delivery.
I'll never get back to heaven.
Oh-ho, shucks.
Something tells me you're forgetting about the horn.
Would you take it easy?
There's plenty of time for that. Come on.
Anabelle is not going to like this, Charlie.
Hey.
Nice digs, huh, Itch?
Grrrrrr!
Wow!
You! What do you want?
You left your doggy bag.
Oh, right. Um, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
There's more than enough.
If you want some company, we could stick around.
Sorry, I've got a kid.
Uh, yeah, but, uh...
I'm good with kids.
Whoa. She's got a "kid" kid.
Thanks, girl.
What did he do, follow you home?
Aah!
You can talk?
Please, don't encourage him.
Aah!
He understands you?
Of course he can.
Holy cow!
Holy dogs, actually.
I'm Charlie. He's Itchy.
What's going on here?
And I want the truth.
The truth?
I'm... an...
Angel.
Oh, boy.
Come on.
Somebody's playing a trick.
OK. OK.
If I'm not an angel, how can I do this!
Whew. Wait a minute.
Run, jump, fly?
What did I forget?
Of course.
Watch this, kid.
Aah!
Please...
Hold your applause.
Ta-da!
Wow! That was the best trick I've ever seen.
Trick?
I do magic, too.
Give me the ball, boy.
Wow! That was... that was...
Real... I can't... more.
More.
The kid's good.
Listen...
I could help with his technique.
Houdini.
That little boy is lost.
If you want to help, ask him where he lives.
Charlie, look.
It's a miracle.
Why not ask him yourself?
Now, that would be a miracle.
One miracle, coming up.
Of all the arrogant, presumptuous, egotistical mutts I've ever met.
Now you talk.
You must be an angel.
Hey, Charlie, you used up your miracle, and that was for an emergency.
It seemed like an emergency.
You must be my guardian angel.
Your what?
Your what?
My mom said everyone has a guardian angel.
You're here because
I ran away from home, right?
Uh, sure. Right, kid.
We're going to make some team, huh?
You mean, you're not lost?
Not anymore.
I got my guardian angel.
Hold it.
Why'd you run away?
You tell her.
This ought to be good.
It's, um...
Um, uh...
You're having, uh...
Ha ha...
Kid problems?
Yeah, with my step-mom.
Knew it.
Eh, I knew it.
She wants me to call her mom, but she's not.
I'm never going home again.
Do you plan to live on the street?
Yep.
And do my magic at cannery square.
Tourists give you money.
Now, you know that's silly.
Come on. Tell me where you live.
No!
OK. Don't listen to me.
Listen to your guardian angel.
David, cannery square sounds...
Like a good plan.
What?
Don't listen to him!
He's not ready to go home.
Come on. He's only 8 years old.
That's 56 in dog years.
Who knows where your talent will take you.
Oh, please.
No. You must have faith.
Guardian angels move in mysterious ways.
So we're off to cannery square?
Not cannery square.
Easy street.
Yes!
You with us, Sasha?
I don't know what you're up to, but I'm watching you.
I wouldn't want it any other way.
Charles!
We've got a traffic jam up here.
New arrivals can't get in.
We need that horn.
Put them on a holding pattern.
I'm really onto something here.
Wha... wha... wha...
What?
Ooh. You're going to love this place, boss.
It's got everything you wanted.
Beachfront location, fenced yard, tight security.
The joint's been home to some great pedigrees.
Capone...
Machine-gun Kelly...
The bird dog of Alcatraz.
Oh ho.
All that...
And ratatouille, too.
Then I did good?
Have a bone.
Which way to cannery square?
Uh, just follow your nose.
So, is there a Mr. Sasha?
Nope, and I'm not taking applications.
OK, OK.
But if you were, what, uh...
What qualities would you be looking for?
Oh, I don't know.
Ah, of course you do.
Well...
Loyalty, strength, breeding...
I'd be good at that.
Humility.
Compassion...
And of course, style.
Look out!
Charlie, you OK?
Boy...
Are my ears ringing.
Yeah, you're right.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
That's not your ears, Charlie, that's...
Oh, that's got to be...
The horn.
Look, Charlie...
There it is.
Go get it, Itch.
I'll stay here... with Sasha.
Uh-uh. That's your job.
I'll stay with Sasha.
OK. Be back before you can say hallelujah.
Where's he going?
Um, confidential guardian angel business.
You dogs have enjoyed a state of grace for far too long.
Wouldn't you agree, Carface?
Uh, yeah...
Whatever you say, boss.
All these cells...
Filled with dogs.
Can you see it?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
And me playing Gabriel's horn!
Can you hear it?
Oh, sure. Just, uh, put your lips together and blow.
And then...
The grand finale!
Oh, um, that ain't, uh, that's not coming in so clear, actually.
Oh, it will.
And all thanks to Charlie Barkin.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Make sure he doesn't disappoint me.
You got it, boss.
âª it's so, so stirring âª
âª I feel like purring âª
âª it's deeply pleasin' âª
âª to be the reason âª
âª so many will be so sad âª
âª 3 cheers for treachery âª
âª it feels so good to be bad âª bah ha!
Let's go.
Step through.
Good boy.
Nice little dog there.
Get this, Mcdowell.
"Man finds genie in his vacuum cleaner."
Last week you believed that scientists created intelligent lunch meat.
That's why everyone's afraid to ride in a car with you.
Hey, sarge, you got a lost-and-found here?
Room 112 through the squad room.
I'm telling you, Mcdowell, there are some mighty weird things in this world.
Any ideas why he ran away?
It could only be one thing.
We're having a baby, and David got very upset when I told him.
Whoo!
I can't believe this.
Now, where'd I put that lost-and-found list?
Come to Charlie.
Ohh! Duhh!
Of course, it couldn't be Gabriel's flute or Gabriel's kazoo.
No.
Thanks, officer Reyes.
Don't worry. We'll find your little boy.
Itchy, where is he, and what's this all about?
Sorry, can't.
Charlie and I are sworn to secrecy.
My lips... these lips right here...
Well, they're sealed.
Itchy...
Miss me?
Charlie! Ha ha!
So, where's the you-know-what?
Minor setback, Itch.
We're just going to have to bust it out.
It? What it?
Charlie, no.
Well...
Yeow!
Charlie, don't give away the "it."
You ever hear of Gabriel's horn?
All right, here's the plan.
Heh heh heh heh!
Just keep moving.
Doing great.
Act like you belong here.
Just through the door.
I don't think this is going to work.
Nobody even sees us.
No eye contact.
Am I good, or what?
Ho!
Aah!
Don't you... what did you do?
Plan "B," guys.
Doughnuts!
Fresh off the truck!
Doughnuts!
Look out!
Yahoo!
Somebody get that mutt!
Hey! Hey!
Come back here!
Hey! Whoa!
Get over here!
He's headed for the file...
Aah!
Oh, no!
Somebody help me!
Ooh! Ooh!
File this!
Aah!
Ooh!
Oof! Uhh!
Oops. Sorry, officer.
We got you.
OK, son.
Give up the keys.
You heard him, little man.
Nothing up my sleeve, sir.
What?
What?
Officer, what's that behind your ear?
Thank you. Thank you.
You've been a great audience.
Come on!
Mission accomplished.
Come on!
Ooh!
Oh, my gosh.
David!
Uh... uh... David!
Freeze! Sit!
Stay!
What the...
Move! Move! Move!
Stop that kid!
And those dogs!
Kick it, Charlie!
You don't have a license to do that!
Hey! Short legs!
Aah!
It's the dog pound for sure!
Jump, Itch.
Aah-aah!
Aah!
Whoo!
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!
Yahoo!
Wow! Aren't guardian angels supposed to protect people?
Hey, it's my first day on the job.
Aah!
I'm going to barf.
Yee-ha!
Having fun, are we?
Hah!
Aah!
Aah!
Eee, naranja.
Aah!
You finally got your flying lessons, eh, Itch?
I'm going to get you for this, Charlie.
Aw, what do you mean, we're not going back yet?
We got the horn, don't we?
Come on. Let's get out of here.
I still need to take care of David.
I am his guardian angel.
Sure. And Sasha has nothing to do with it.
Well, uh...
Charlie, you're making me crazy here.
Just a little more time.
The horn will be safe here.
No! Charlie!
Wouldn't you rather be home right now, David?
Not that again.
I'm going to cannery square.
Don't you mean... Easy street?
Yeah.
How far is it?
A lot closer than you think.
You nervous?
A little.
And sweaty.
Well, don't be.
Excited?
You bet.
Now, Charlie.
It's OK.
All set.
Let's go.
Whah!
Ha ha ha ha!
âª outta his way âª
âª he's comin' through âª
âª the kid's makin' his show biz debut âª
âª you'll be amazed, amused, enthused âª
âª and bowled over âª
âª I've got the moves,
I've got the tricks âª
âª I've been practicin' since I was 6 âª
âª his dues are paid, he's got it made âª
âª soon we'll be in clover âª
âª easy street âª
âª where the sun's always shinin' âª
âª not a cloud in the sky âª
âª clear and sunny âª
âª milk and honey âª
âª life is sweet âª
âª on easy street... âª
Charlie, I hope you know what you're doing.
Relax. Enjoy the show.
It ain't over yet.
Hmph.
âª when you're a big celebrity âª
âª fans are like a family âª
âª abracadabra... poof! âª
âª I'll be a sensation âª
âª and I'll be there through thick and thin âª
âª watchin' the dough come rollin' in âª
âª a couple of shows and then we'll close âª
âª and take our vacation âª
âª on easy street âª
âª where the sun's always shinin' âª
âª not a cloud in the sky âª
âª good-time livin' âª
âª it's a given âª
âª we'll all meet âª

âª life on easy âª
âª street âª
Come on. Let's get you out of the rain.
One, please.
Thank you.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a shoe.
How about you?
I thought so.
I'll be right back.
My mom used to do that.
Charlie...
Can she see me from heaven?
Of course she can, kiddo.
David, remember, you still have your dad and step-mom.
My step-mom doesn't want me.
She's having her own kid.
Parents can love more than one pup.
Maybe she just didn't know how to tell you that.
Maybe you should give her another chance.
I ran away from home when I was little.
That make your parents sorry?
I don't know. I never saw them after that.
I guess I could have used a guardian angel, huh?
Charlie, I'll go home...
If you promise to take me.
I promise.
Really?
That would be great.
You can sleep on my bed, and we'll play in the yard.
We'll be one big family.
David, hold on.
I can't promise that.
We struck gold!
Egg foo Yung, mu shu pork, wonton, and I hope you like potstickers.
Ha ha! Napkins?
Get... what...
Nice work, Charlie Barkin.
You really are an angel.
No, I'm not.
Not a guardian angel, anyway.
What you did for David was wonderful.
I'm not his angel.
I'm just an errand boy sent to fetch Gabriel's horn.
Sasha, my whole life had been about making and breaking promises.
And now I'm going to do it again.
You can't take him home?
I have to go back.
Just when I finally found someone special.
Oh, Charlie.
âª I will always be with you âª
âª makes no difference where your road takes you to âª
âª even if we're apart âª
âª now we're joined at the heart âª
âª though our moment may be gone âª
âª you and I will still live on âª
âª I will always be with you âª
âª I'll be by your side âª
âª whatever you do âª
âª other memories may fade âª
âª but the ones that we made âª
âª are eternal as a star âª
âª now I'm part of who you are âª
âª and I'll be there with you âª
âª in the sound of your laughter âª
âª I'll be in the tears you cry âª
âª 'cause the way you and I âª
âª have touched one another âª
âª doesn't end with good-bye âª
âª I will always be with you âª
âª like a guardian angel âª
âª constant and true âª
âª when you're lost in the night âª
âª and you can't see the light âª
âª my love will see you through âª
âª I will always be there âª
âª you'll have me there âª
âª I will always be with âª
âª you âª
Charlie?
Oh, no, no.
Not now.
Sasha! I can't find Itchy.
Where's Charlie?
David, I'm here.
Right here.
He's gone.
He wouldn't leave.
He's my guardian angel.
We got to do something.
They'll be fine, Charlie.
I promised David I'd get him home.
Short legs. Ooh.
I guess I'm short.
Charlie!
Hey, you got any 6s?
Go fish.
Red!
Yaah-ha!
Red. Heh.
I gotta... I gotta ask a favor.
Anything, Charlie.
Just name it.
I need a new collar.
You enjoyed it.
I knew you would.
Oh, thanks.
You're a pal.
Can I have it now?
Oh... I am sorry.
You misunderstood me.
If you want another collar, you must pay.
Oh. Heh.
You caught me a little short.
How about a... an IOU?
I don't think so.
Carface will show you out.
There must be some way to make a deal.
Uh... Charlie.
He, uh, he might take a trade.
Wait. Wait.
Good-bye.
Red?
I have...
This horn.
Sorry.
I'm not musical.
No. This is much more than a horn, Red.
There's nothing like it in the whole world.
Let me sleep on it.
I don't have that kind of time.
I like your spirit, Charlie.
Bring me this horn, and you can have the collar.
Right.
Uh... I need the collar to get it.
Oh, really?
Come on, Red, you can trust me.
This isn't about trust.
A deal with me is binding.
Charlie!
No!
Deal?
Ha ha ha ha!
Aah!
Aaahhh!
Waah-hah!
I guess that cat's out of the bag, eh?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You tricked me.
Now, be a good little bow-wow...
And fetch me my horn.
Oh! Charlie!
Follow him.
Where are you going, Charlie?
To the train station.
Uhh! Charlie!
Are you nuts?
You... you gave away the horn.
Get out of my way.
You shook on it.
You made a deal with him.
You promised Anabelle.
And you promised me, Charlie.
I know that, but right now, I've got to find David.
Move!
Come on, David.
Which train?
Where's Charlie?
He wouldn't leave me.
David?
David?
Rarrhh!
Aah!
Bring the item to Alcatraz in one hour, or junior here doesn't have a prayer.
Ha ha ha ha!
Charlie!
Where is he?
The hour's up.
You know what they say, boss.
Patience is...
Rrrahhh!
Uh... maybe he's stuck in traffic.
What kind of dog are you, selling out to some mangy old cat?
Quiet, or I'll have your tongue, boy.
Red?
Charlie.
The horn.
Let me, boss.
I'll fetch it for you.
Aah!
Gabriel's horn is finally mine.
Boss, they're hitting the bricks!
Let them.
I have what I want.
Ha ha ha ha hah!
Arrrgh!
Ha ha ha ha!
Silence!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
Charlie, what's happening?
Don't worry about it.
Let's get out of here!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Come on! Jump!
Aah!
Charles, what have you done?
Charlie, we got to do something.
No, Itch, it's my fault.
I'm the one who's got to do something...
Get David home safely.
Charlie!
No!
Red, Charlie's coming back!
Heh heh heh heh heh.
That puppy's into punishment.
Oof!
It's a cat's world now!
Aah!
Let him go!
Yaah!
Run, David!
No!
David!
All right, you!
I'm coming!
Aah!
Which do you want...
The horn...
Or your friends?
Itchy! Help us!
Everyone, scatter!
Come back here!
Play the horn, Charles.
The horn!
Charlie!
This should cool him off.
Aaaahh.
Take a bath!
Enough stupid pet tricks!
Aah!
Here, kitty, kitty.
I like your spirit.
Oops! Ha ha ha!
Hope you can dog paddle!
Charlie!
Yaaahhh!
Waaah!
Uh! Uh! Wha...
Ah! Ah! Aah!
Aaah!
Aaaahh!
Ha-lo!
Double chili catburger with onions and pickles.
Everyone OK?
I think so.
I'm fine.
I'm good.
Me, too.
Where's Red?
His boss yanked his leash.
Ah, good riddance.
Ptooey!
Charlie...
I hope you didn't take any of that personally.
I was just, you know, playing the game.
Sure, Carface.
Say, what did you trade
Red for your collar?
He wanted the bottom of my shoes or something.
Ah ha ha! I don't even wear shoes. Stupid cat.
Stupid dog!
It was your soul!
Ah! Let me go!
This is not good.
Yikes! Not the flames.
No, no!
Not the flames.
What do you know?
And I thought all dogs go to heaven.
Anabelle.
Come on, Charlie.
Time to go.
Already?
David... can Sasha take you home?
Charlie...
Don't go.
Hey...
I'll always be your guardian angel.
OK.
Sasha...
I love you.
I love you, too, Charlie.
Hey... what's wrong?
Is this thing stuck between floors?
I'll take the horn from here, Charles.
What? Afraid I'll drop it?
Ooh!
There's someone who still needs to go back where he belongs.
I already took care of David.
Not David.
You, Charlie.
For what you've done, you deserve a second chance.
Claim this in, oh, say...
20 years?
You mean?
Itchy, you hear that?
We're going back!
Nah.
Not this wiener dog.
See, when you can fly...
Short legs don't matter.
Ha ha!
I'm gonna miss you, pal.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Take care of yourself, buddy.
What... what is it, girl?
Can you believe it?
Charlie?
Why, Charlie!
I got a weekend pass...
For the rest of my life.
Oh, Charlie.
David?
Thom, it's David!
Davey!
Ohh, David!
You're all right!
I've been worried sick about you.
You worried about me?
Of course.
Having this baby doesn't mean I don't love you.
I know that now...
Mom.
Honey, we're a family.
That's right.
Just a bigger one.
Dad...
Mom...
Speaking of bigger families...
Do we have room for a pet or 2?
Tell me the truth, Charlie Barkin.
Why'd you really come back?
And don't con me.
Actually, I kind of like the idea of being Mr. Sasha.
Hey, guys!
I worked a little magic!
âª now that you're lovin' me âª
âª it's so heavenly âª
âª hallelujah, hallelujah âª
âª hallelujah âª
âª so heavenly here âª
âª hallelujah âª
âª I will always be with you âª
âª makes no difference âª
âª where your road takes you to âª
âª even if we're apart âª

Lord of all flesh... and in whose ever embrace all creatures live.
And whatsoever world or condition they be...
I beseech Thee to pull her hand to His name and dwell into.
And every need Thou knowest.
Thou art life and rest, refreshment... joy and consolation and paradise and in companionship... of the saints... in the presence of Christ and the hands that hold... all guide with love.
Where's Father?
He's in the pub.
- It's the little sprat again.
- Poor creature.
As pale as a fish's belly.
And those eyes!
She's only lost in the world.
And what would you be in a strange land without a mother's touch?
- A drunkard!
- You're already that.
Jim, wake up, will ya?
It's your daughter.
How are you, girl?
She's worn out.
Open your eyes!
She looks as if she's raised in a tin box.
Fresh air. That's the ticket.
A little sprat like her breathing the poison fumes in this town's air.
Take her to the country.
There's no work to be had at home.
I'm never going back to the island.
That's done.
A lemon squash for you, dear.
This isn't a place to be raising a girl.
I do my best.
You try, bless you.
Why not send her to her grandfather's?
You'd like that, wouldn't ya, love?
You'd like that, living with the old people.
Grandfather!
Fiona.
- We were expecting you later.
- Father put me on the morning boat.
You climbed all this way up by yourself?
It's great to see ya!
Your grandmother saw you below.
She nearly had a fit.
She knew it was me?
With that head of hair? At double the distance, I'd know you were a Coneelly.
Your father and his brother the same.
All but forJamie.
He's the only dark one.
You better not mention anything aboutJamie in front of Grandmother.
She's gettin' the tea ready for you now.
Oh, look at your arms, dear.
Like sticks they are.
- Eat up now.
- It's the sea air she's needin'.
I hear you can't find a proper hen's egg in that city.
The ones here is nothing compared to what was laid on the island.
You and that island.
'Tis true. Didn't our own cow only give half the milk she gave in Roan Inish?
What's done is done.
There's no use moaning over it.
Why did we have to leave?
It was the young people, like your father and his brothers.
They were restless on the island.
Then came the war and jobs across the sea.
Now as they have the taste of the city in their blood...
City indeed!
Nothing but noise, dirt... and people that's lost their senses.
Couldn't tell the difference between a riptide and a raindrop... if you shoved their face in the water.
- But you and Grandmother...
- Oh, no. We couldn't start from naught.
Living alone on an island.
There isn't a thing out there for us but sad memories.
Can you see it from here?
If the sky is willing, some can.
Look out there.
Do you see a lighthouse on a long flat island?
I think I do.
Then beyond there to your right... a great island of dark hills.
There's a wee green bit of an island between them.
- She sees it!
- You put it into her head!
She sees it!
Only them that's born to the islands can see it from this distance.
They say the east is our future and the west is our past.
The island's to the west of us, Hugh.
That's Roan Inish, girl.
Island of the seals.
There's more of them now that the people have deserted.
- You've been out there?
- Once a week if the current's right.
- God bless all here.
- Eamon! Get in and sit for tea.
You remember him, Fiona?
Your cousin Eamon, Uncle Patrick's boy.
Hello.
You moved back to the west.
Are you pleased?
I'm well pleased.
How come you never left with your family?
I tried it for a month, then I ran back here.
I'm not clever enough to live in town.
Too fast for me.
He's as good a young fella in a curragh as ever I've seen.
Love of the sea is a sickness.
You two will come to grief for it.
Eat.
- She seen Roan Inish on her first look.
- Is that so?
You go there, too?
I've not set foot there since the evacuation.
But Grandfather knows the shoals all about it... and what feeds there and when.
We always come back with a full net when the rest are scared to fish it.
- Why are they scared?
- Eamon.
Oh. Tales is all.
Tales of what?
If it clears up this evening, you might see the light again.
Light?
There's an end of it!
I'll not have nonsense and superstition in my house.
Here. Do your duty by those cakes.
They won't keep. Your grandfather's already filled his gullet.
The sea gives, and the sea takes away.
This... is my father's father's father now... a Coneelly man... when he was only a few years older than you are now.
His name was Sean Michael.
Smart boy, dark haired.
Bit of the rebel in him.
Though times weren't as hard on the island as on the mainland... it's never easy pulling a living from the sea.
The English were still a force in the country then.
They had the schools.
It was their language and their ways that you had to learn there, or else.
There was a new schoolmaster in the school one year.
As stiff as a cat's whiskers, he was.
And Sean Michael wasn't a week in his class... before he put the cingulum about his neck.
It was a punishment of those days for speaking irish within his earshot.
Eject! Eject!
Sean Michael stuck it out for as long as he could... for he had a strength of character.
But the shame was too great, and he tore it from his neck... and he went for the schoolmaster and began to beat on the man crying out...
Hugh, please!
It's a little girl.
You don't understand, do you, girl?
I don't have any Irish.
- More is the pity of it.
- Aye.
Sean Michael's father had great hopes for the boy, clever as he was... that he would learn to read the Englishman's language... and study his laws, and grow to be a leader for his people.
But there was his son, knuckles bloody, anger in his heart... standing before him.
"You'll need to kill me to make me go back," he says.
His father sighed then, and looked out to the sea beyond them.
"You'll have nothing now," he said...
"but the black rocks, the wild waves and the hard sky above you."
And wasn't it his first trip out with his father... that a fierce storm from the north blew over them.
Sean Michael, his father, brothers, uncles and cousins... four boats in all.
And it took them in its terrible grip... lifted them high and turned them over... and slapped them back down into the violent black sea... with the scraps of their curraghs around them.
His father, caught in their net and dragged below without a whisper.
Out as far as they were, in a northern storm, an experienced fisherman... would swallow his draught of water and swim to the bottom.
For to fight the cold sea is only to prolong your suffering.
But Sean Michael was green with it.
And he flailed and cried out... and he beat the water with his legs and arms... till the sea grew to hate him and refused to swallow him up.
It was a full day later... when people gathering mussels on the strand found him.
Some was even afraid to touch him.
It was women mostly, softhearted as they are.
The boy was more dead than alive.
Cold as ice to the touch.
There wasn't a fire in ireland could bring the blood of life back into him.
This is the time when the country people still lived with their beasts inside.
And the woman as owned the house they brought him to said...
"Here, bind him up to my cow."
And then she brought another alongside.
And their heat went out through him.
Soon he began to shiver, and then he began to shake.
And then he slept like a Christian... for hours and hours.
When he started to sweat, the woman cut him loose from her animals... and they bathed him, and wrapped him in blankets warmed in the hearth.
He woke to their faces above him... all women and girls.
"Is this heaven, then?"he said.
"No, lad,"said the woman of the house.
"It's only Tech Duin."
Tech Duin is the islands where the people thought... that the souls of all Ireland's dead were held to rest.
So Sean Michael believed he had drowned... and come to the hereafter.
"'Twas a seal that brought me here," he told them.
"I was sinking under... destroyed by the effort of keeping my head above the swell.
And a body, warm body... came under me and lifted me up.
It was a seal from the feel of its hide.
A great dark seal that bore me along through the storm... and i hugging its neck.
That's all i remember until i woke to your faces above me."
Now, with his father and brothers... and uncles and cousins all gone... there was only Sean Michael left... to keep the Coneellys alive in these islands.
He was saved by a seal?
- And two cows.
- And a woman as had her wits about her.
It's a wonderful story.
Some think so.
And some say you should never save a drowning man.
What the sea will take, the sea must have.
That's a lot of foolishness.
It's said that some that are saved turn wicked afterwards.
What happened to Sean Michael, your great-grandfather?
Jailed by the English.
Died in prison a man of 50.
Smuggling arms to the Fenians, he was.
That's enough for now.
Take the child to bed, Hugh.
She's exhausted.
Aye.
Sweet dreams, dear.
Superstitious old man!
I rake this fire as the pure Christ rakes us all... with Mary at the foot and Brigid at the head.
And may the eight brightest angels from the City of Grace... preserwe this house and all its people till the coming of the day.
The light.
Out into the sun with you, now.
You'll find him below on the strand.
Just follow the path across.
Grandfather!
Ah, Fiona!
I was just wishing
I had someone to lend me a hand.
It'd be a great help to me if you kept stirring the tar in this bucket.
I'd love it.
In the olden times people used cowhide on their curraghs.
Then it was calico.
Now we make do with canvas.
The tar is what it always was.
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.
She's put in an extra mug for ya.
There.
I think I saw the light last night.
Light, is it?
What light might that be?
The one Eamon spoke of on Roan Inish.
There's plenty of things could be taken for a light in the dark.
And no tellin' how far off they might be.
You want me to forget aboutJamie.
We'll none of us forget him, dear.
But life goes on.
Can't even remember when we lost him.
I was already off in the ship when it happened.
It was a strange day.
Everyone on the beach for the evacuation.
The air was very still, like it is sometimes before a storm.
It was like a dream that day... slow, terrible dream that you watch.
You can't stop it.
All the people had rode out, and most of the goods.
There was only your father and brother ashore... and weeJamie sleeping in his cradle.
- In his cradle?
- Aye.
Pulled up on the beach.
Jamie!
Wait! Help me!
Look there!
Jamie!
"Jamie!" he called.
"We're comin', boy."
I don't know how the cradle could've made up so much speed.
The sea had taken poor weeJamie.
It was angry with us for leavin' Roan Inish.
Mind that tar, love, or it'll be stiffer than an old man on a winter's night.
- He could still be out there.
- Jamie?
Alive?
And cows could have wings.
You see this?
It's a seal rent it open.
They're terrible rascals for stealin' fish.
One stared at me from the rock when I came in.
Maybe he's fell in love.
You've got to be careful
'cause one day a year... all the seals gather to choose their new king.
And it's said whichever of the island girls he fancies most... is taken below to live as his queen.
- That's just stories.
- Some stories is true, though.
Grandfather told me aboutJamie, about when he was taken.
- Did he tell you the rumors?
- About what?
There's them who claim to have seen him.
LittleJamie sailing the seas in his cradle boat.
What does he look like?
They say he's grown into a fine little gossoon... sittin' in the stern of his cradle like a captain in his ship.
Always there's creatures about him.
Seals swimmin' in the water... great crowd of sea gulls squawkin' overhead.
If you call out or try to come closer, he vanishes... in a great splash in the water and wings flappin' like a phantom they say.
Where do they see him?
Comin' back from the far side of the island, close to Roan Inish.
- Grandfather!
- Shh! Don't let on I told you!
What is it?
Can I go out with you sometimes in your boat?
It'll be a few days before the tar is dried.
Then?
Well, we'll have to ask your grandmother first.
She won't have you out on a boat unless the day is fine.
Grandmother!
I've lost track.
Is this Roan Inish?
Quiet now, and you'll see something.
See that little fellow?
It's his first year at sea.
He's the one that stared at me from the boat coming over.
I'm sure he is.
You scared 'em away with your screechin'.
He was the one I saw.
He really did remember me.
Hide your face then, or he'll be takin' you for a wife.
- Don't scare the child.
- Fiona's never scared.
- Are you?
- His name is Jax.
- How do you know that?
- It just is.
- There it is.
- Roan Inish?
Aye.
Isn't it beautiful?
Do you remember it, Fiona?
That was your house at that end.
- Tess and I were next door.
- And ours was the one beyond.
Right. We'll set those pots and be back.
Don't wander too far.
I wish you could talk to me.
Fiona!
We better be goin' while the tide's still with us.
- Do you miss it greatly?
- Roan Inish?
It's only a place, I suppose.
Mostly I miss the way of life.
You're surrounded by the sea, your whole family about you.
I'm movin' back.
When I'm a man.
You'll be a sorry sight on your own, hauntin' the island on your lonesome.
- I'll have a wife.
- But will she have you?
Not many women these days see much romance in hard work and solitude.
I'm movin' back just the same.
I remember the evenings best.
We'd drop over and your mother,
God rest her... would be layin' out food.
Your father smokin', dryin' his feet by the fire.
Then you, Fiona, and poor weeJamie... off in the corner with little pieces of dinnerware.
Tea parties, it was.
You were always a great one for the tea parties.
Someone's been in our old cottage.
- Vandals, is it?
- No.
Someone is living there.
Don't be daft.
I saw a footprint, a footprint of a little boy.
- Why didn't you show it to us?
- A wave destroyed it.
There's all sorts of things that can look like a footprint in the shore.
I saw it! I did!
- So you saw the island today?
- Yes.
And the houses are in a terrible state, I suppose?
They weren't so bad, with a little cleaning.
Ah, if you're idle for a week, nature takes it back.
There'll be birds nestin' in the thatch and chimney.
Creepy-crawly things in every corner.
It wasn't so bad. Our old cottage looked as if we left it a day ago.
There was sand and everything, blowin' off the beach.
It was clean, though.
And the mornings... and the mist on the water.
We could move back. Grandfather said it's the best fishing.
Oh, child, I couldn't think of it.
I've only the picture in my mind of your poor little brother floatin' away.
The only real tragedy in life is young people passin' on before their time.
I always remember his eyes.
Dark they were, with a great soul behind them.
Oh, he was here before.
Jamie.
Tess, don't start.
Right.
One and a quarter pounds to the grain.
You're a mean, penny-pinchin' creature, Flynn.
Fiona, darlin', you have my purse.
- Is this the granddaughter then?
- It is.
She isn't one of the dark ones, is she?
Mind your own business.
You wait here, darlin', while I go and fetch your grandfather.
I could get him.
I'll not have a young girl exposed to the layabouts in that pub.
You call this fresh, do you?
You ought to be ashamed.
She's the original tough customer, old Tess.
What's "dark ones"?
You said before that I wasn't a dark one.
- Haven't they told you?
- Told me what?
Come along then.
There's an example for you.
Tadhg'd be your father's first cousin.
Once in a generation the Coneelly's spit out a dark one.
- Like my brotherJamie?
- Aye!
Tadhg would be the one ahead of him.
Will he know me?
You can talk to him if you like, but there's no saying if he'll talk back.
He's a bit special, if you know what I mean.
Hello.
I'm Fiona, Fiona Coneelly.
You know my father.
I know you.
You do?
- You're after something?
- I am?
It's as plain as day.
Will I find it?
I've no idea of the future... but I can see the past quite well... and the present, if the weather's clear.
Better leave off.
You're frightening the wee girl.
She's not easily frightened, this one.
Am I right?
- Do you know why I'm dark?
- 'Cause his brain's leakin' shoe polish.
- That's enough!
- Easy.
The Coneellys first came to Roan Inish... when it was still only Irish spoken on the islands.
They built their meager homes on the beach... and the seals and the birds moved aside to make room for them.
There's only a few families, and all related.
So when it came time to find a mate, it was elsewhere you had to look.
There was a boy among them, Liam... who always preferred to be alone.
He set his own traps, built his own curragh.
He sat alone at all the family gatherings.
One day walking about the outer islands... he saw a thing his eyes could scarce believe.
In them days, the seals was hunted for their oil and hides.
Clubbed to death, and made into coats, pouches and pampooties for the feet.
But Liam never took part in it... for he believed as many did then... that there was no worse luck than to harm a seal.
Liam had seen a selkie.
A creature that's half human, half beast.
Old stories told of such creatures... luring ships onto the rocks, and pulling sailors down into the drink.
But all Liam knew... was he had never seen a woman so lovely in all his life.
Now it was said the whoever could capture the hide of a selkie... would have it in their power... to command as they would.
The selkie maid had seen man before.
Fled from their fishing hooks and their spears and mattocks.
But never had she seen one as glorious handsome as Liam Coneelly.
All the islanders had seen Liam row out to sea alone.
And now all saw his return with the strange girl.
Island people is a careful lot.
Not likely to pass judgment on another person's business in public.
There was something so unearthly about the girl... that soon set their tongues to wagging.
There was much shaking of heads when Liam married the stranger.
She hardly spoke at all, and when she did... her Irish was queer sounding.
More ancient than their grandfather's grandfather's.
And when they asked him where he had found her... with her great dark eyes... and her wild black hair... he'd only say Trabeg.
Of course this was nonsense because it was only a speck in the ocean... that even the seals had to leave when the tide was high.
And she'd always be at the water...
Iooking out at the seals and the birds.
She'd come back each day with her hands full of shellfish and seaweed... which she'd simmer over a driftwood fire... in a manner all her own.
But all had to admit that she was a good wife for their Liam.
Before long, she was asking him to build a cradle for their firstborn.
It must be made of the wood of a ship that sailed the ocean, she told him.
And there'll be no need for rockers for it will rock on the motion of the sea.
It was the queerest-lookin'thing.
More of a ship than cradle.
And carved with shells, fish and seaweed.
And whenever the day was calm, they put the babe afloat on the water.
Rocking on the sea, with the ripple of the waves for a lullaby.
The years passed... and Liam and Nuala, for that's what the selkie called herself... was happy in their work.
And their love grew and they had many children.
With all that... there was always a touch of sadness about Nuala.
And she spent long hours looking out at that that she had come from.
And listening to the cries of the seals on the outer islands.
One of these afternoons, it was her eldest... who was called Fiona... said the words to her that changed their home.
Why does Father hide a leather coat in the roof?
Later that evening... as Liam was rowing home... he was followed by a solitary seal.
It seemed joyous in its movements.
It rolled and dived within the waves... joyous in the sleekness of its body.
Its eyes, as with all its kind... held a sadness as deep as the soul.
When the seal left him at last...
Liam felt a great emptiness inside of fear!
He rowed furious for the shore even though the sea was heavy on his oars.
When he got home... it was the faces of his children told him his fears were true.
For once a selkie finds its skin again... neither chains of steel nor chains of love... can keep her from the sea.
From that day on... it was forbidden to harm a seal on the island.
And man and beast lived side by side, sharing the wealth of the sea.
And sometimes the Coneellys would see her... out in the waves... basking in the sun on Trabeg... watching them... watching her children.
And the cradle was passed on through the years... with each new infant of the Coneellys rocked upon the waves within it.
And every so often... there'd be one born with the dark eyes and black hair... that the selkie had left in their blood.
And these darks ones were most at home at sea.
Great sailors and fisher folk, every one of them.
Like Tadhg here.
He's an admiral in the Royal Navy.
Fiona! Get out from there!
Your grandfather's ready.
Welcome back, Fiona Coneelly.
We've been waitin'.
Is he mad?
Tadhg.
Oh, no, he's not mad.
A wee bit strange, maybe.
Always has been.
He was a sailor for a little while.
Off to savage islands in the East.
Places a Christian man does well to avoid.
- Did he upset you?
- No. He was very pleasant.
You're not to mind anything he says to you.
Poor fellow doesn't know if he's wide awake or dreaming.
Your grandfather and I have to go to Kilmurry Banks tomorrow.
To deal with the landlord.
Would you like to come?
Or maybe go with Eamon?
He has to deliver a parcel for the postman among the smaller islands.
I'd like to go with him.
If the weather holds and you dress warm.
He's a troubled soul,
Tadhg Coneelly.
It's as if he's caught between earth and water.
And when the sun is just four fingers above the horizon, you'll be waiting?
I promise.
And if the weather turns foul?
I'll go into the cottage and wait for you. I promise.
- You remember where there's water?
- I do.
If any harm comes to you, they'll have me head.
- I'll be careful.
- All right then.
Jamie!
Jamie, I found you at last!
Jamie! Come back to me!
- Right on time.
- I saw him today.
- Saw who?
- Jamie.
Sure you did.
I did!
I went into the cottage and made a fire.
I fell asleep and dreamed of the selkie woman.
When I woke, I climbed to the top of the island.
I saw that seal, the little one that's been watchin' me.
Then I was walkin', and he was there.
Jamie, pickin' flowers!
But he ran from me. And before
I could reach him, he was gone.
Gone where?
In his cradle.
He sailed away around the rocks.
There's talk of spirits here.
He wasn't a spirit. He's a little boy.
I saw the flowers he pulled up.
He dropped them when he ran.
Can a spirit do that?
You've got to believe me.
I saw him.
I do believe you. But you mustn't tell our grandparents about what happened.
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- But if they knew?
They'd think you were dreaming it all.
Let me think about it.
We'll come up with a plan. Agreed?
Agreed.
Good evening, Grandfather.
Grandfather?
What's wrong?
Oh, there you are, dear.
What is it?
You know, we don't own this house.
The landlord says he got a letter today from some wealthy people overseas... who wants a place to summer in.
"A gold mine," he called it.
- Where will you go?
- Inland. Nothing is available here.
It was bad enough your grandfather having to come in off the island.
But to take him away from the sea.
I'm fearin' his spirits will fail him.
They can't do that.
It isn't fair.
It's the times, darlin'.
After a war, people are always ready to cut off the past and go forward.
We're the ones left behind is all.
That's not your worry, Fiona darlin'.
Your shoulders is too narrow to be carryin' all of that.
It's not lifting at all.
The mackerel won't see us comin', then.
It's not fish I'm talkin' about.
We can't take this wee one out with dirty weather comin' up.
It'll clear, you'll see.
You're an expert now, are ya?
I'm sorry, but your grandmother would never forgive me if you took a chill.
You'll see naught but gray water on a day like this.
It's for the best.
And be careful climbing up to the house.
Wait! Your sandwiches!
Grandfather?
Eamon?
Is that you?
Jax, I can't see you.
Jax, is that you?
Are you still there?
Hello! Is anybody out there?
What's happening?
Where are we going?
Won't you come ashore with me?
Jamie!
Jamie, it's me, Fiona.
No, Jamie! Don't go!
It's your sister!
Why must you always run from me?
I know you're out there, and I know you can understand me.
Give him back! Do you hear?
He's a little boy.
He belongs with his family.
I know you've taken care of him, but he has to live with people now.
I miss him so.
And so does Grandmother and Grandfather.
And all the rest.
Miss him terrible.
If we came back, would you give him to us?
If we came back here, to Roan Inish.
Is that what you want?
Are you still there?
That you, Fiona?
We saw the fire.
Grandfather!
Christ Almighty, Fiona.
We were worried sick about you.
I sat in the boat, and it broke free.
Seals came from out of the fog.
And I looked and looked, but he wasn't there. There was smoke in the chimney.
Jamie was inside havin' tea with a little seal, but then they ran away.
She's gone crazy with some kind of fever.
I'm not sick!
How did you get out here, then?
And slow this time.
In the boat.
It drifted.
There's no oars in it.
And look at this.
He set a table inside with shells.
You can see it.
Someone's playin' tricks on us, and it might be you.
I don't lie.
I believe her.
It's the madness that runs in the family.
He's in the cradle, and there's always seals about.
That's from talkin' to Tadhg, isn't it?
He put all this into your head.
- But, Grandfather...
- Not another word.
Get in that curragh.
I need silence to think up some likely excuse for your grandmother.
Ah, seals indeed!
- Good mornin' to ya.
- Good mornin'.
Where's Grandfather?
He's already into the pub this mornin'.
And he'll be less likely to come out as it was a black mood he left with.
I gave him hard with my tongue for takin' you out yesterday.
Nothing bad happened.
Is Eamon going out in the motor boat today?
It doesn't matter whether he is.
You're not goin' with him.
There's no need of the bleak ocean for catchin' a dose of fresh air.
One day ashore won't kill you, will it?
No, ma'am.
Hello.
- Have you seen him?
- Why does he run from me?
- Why do you chase him?
- He's my brother. He's lost.
He isn't lost at all. He's just with another branch of the family.
- Why look at me like that?
- Don't know whether to believe you.
People say you're daft.
They have their reason.
Have you ever seen him?
Have you ever seen Jamie?
I may be daft, girl... but I'm not blind.
- Fisherman's bend.
- Right.
We've got to get them to move back.
I don't see how.
They're going to lose their house.
Nobody's been on the island for years.
It's derelict with weeds, the cottages is fallen to ruin.
Bowline. The cottages aren't so bad.
I've been in them. Didn't you say you planned to move back?
When I'm a man.
What's to stop you now?
Grandmother will be the hard nugget.
She worries awful about Grandfather's health.
Carrick bend.
She'd move back forJamie, though.
In a minute she would.
Them that's caring for him won't let him back... until they see we've returned,
I'm sure of it.
- You've been speaking with the seals?
- We could start fixing the cottages.
What do you think?
- I'll meet you here in the mornin'.
- I'll say we're off digging clams.
Pull this for a deal.
Granny's knot.
Help me with this.
Look at that, will ya?
It's all our food floatin' away.
We could row after it.
Not without losing half a day in the chase. Come on, then.
Look.
It could've tipped in the waves and all spilt out.
Do you think that's what happened?
Not for a moment.
- How did the mussel gathering go?
- We worked wonders with them.
- Didn't we, Fiona?
- It was hard work.
Be careful not to overtax yourself.
I won't. It's good for me.
Look at my muscles.
It's improved your appetite anyway.
You came in here as though the hunger of the world was on you.
We should plant some things up here.
When we move back, there'll be time.
We'd better start back.
The tide won't wait.
Mother?
Your mother is it?
- Where did she come from?
- Hasn't your father told you that?
He doesn't like to speak of her.
She came from Balleybofey back in the mainland.
Traveling the hills in search of a meal and a place to sleep.
They was poor.
Her father with no livelihood, only his day's pay.
Seldom he had even that.
They say the only true wealth is land.
Like we own in Roan Inish.
- For all the good it does us.
- Quiet, Hugh.
Jimmy, your father, was me youngest, and the dearest of me heart.
Oh, but he was an airy boy.
Bone lazy at times, and at others you'd never find a worker as keen as him.
Like night and day he was, depending on the mood that struck him.
Can't put a wise head on a young body.
She was in Donegal town for the pilgrimage on St. Brigid's day... which was her namesake.
Sixteen years of age.
Beautiful, strong Christian girl.
Sun or stars never shone on a better one.
I loved her like a daughter, our Brigid.
- And Father was there?
- We'd a run on mackerel that year.
A great patch of them shoaling up behind the island.
Our men were barely able to dip their nets in the water fast enough.
Your father and Matt Margonn had gone off to the mainland... to sell what they had left over.
First time he laid eyes on Brigid she was leaving the church.
He was struck speechless with the sight of her.
It was the shyness of an island boy, and she wasn't a worldly girl at all.
But toJimmy, anyplace off of Roan Inish... might have been Paris, France.
So there he is, making honey in his heart of her good looks.
Meanwhile, she's just as struck.
With him a big, handsome, powerful lad, with eyes that melted all the girls.
And she's in a hundred pieces, wondering what she could do to meet him.
Did he speak to her?
What did he say?
"Would you like to buy some fish, miss?"
She said she'd love to.
She'd never tasted fish... from the salty ocean in all her life.
But she hadn't a shilling to her name to buy it with.
They fell into talking, great with each other immediately... as happens with the young.
I remember the day she came.
Sittin' in the back of the curragh.
I says to Tess, " Look at the prize
Matt Margonn brought from Donegal."
"No," she says, "for look how Matt's got his eyes straight ahead at the island.
OurJimmy is rowing, so he won't let her out of his sight."
From that day, Jim had the name of a steady husband... and a hard worker.
As fine as any that ever broke bread.
She grew to love the island, our Brigid.
She was the last one to marry on to Roan Inish.
And the last one to die in it.
He always blamed himself... for bringin' her into the life of the sea.
But life can be hard on the mainland, too.
Your hands is gettin' rough.
It's pulling mussels that does it.
Look at them clouds.
Gathering for a right blow tonight.
It's going to be hell's own fury for any creature caught without shelter.
- HopeJamie comes in.
- What was that you were sayin'?
I said I hopeJamie comes in out of the storm.
- What can you mean?
- I've seen him, Grandmother.
She just dreamed him up sleeping one day on Roan Inish.
A wish can be a powerful thing.
I saw him. Once on a hillside picking flowers... and once in the cottage having tea with a seal.
I'm not imagining it. I've seen him.
He was without a stitch.
Then he nipped away in his little cradle boat.
The seals have been lookin' after him.
- The seals, is it?
- It's the truth, Grandmother.
It is.
Oh, dear.
There's a box of biscuits on the shelf.
Will you get it down for me?
Tess?
Put the chickens in their coop like a good girl.
- Is she all right?
- What have you got?
You don't want to sleep out on the cold ground, do you?
Look at that sky.
I can read a sky as well as you.
There's a storm comin'.
And it's no weather to be leavin' a small boy outside in.
I knew he wasn't gone from us.
Holy Mother,
I felt it all along.
Hurry on, will ya?
I'll get the lantern.
And they say the Coneellys is the mad ones.
Mind the bedding, Eamon.
It'll be damp enough in those wraps without a dousing of seawater.
What are you staring at now?
Where's that Fiona got to?
I need her to help gather seaweed for soup.
Tess, look what they've done.
Bless us, sweetJesus.
Now this is a soup as only the women of Roan Inish know how to make.
She learned it from my mother,
Lord be good to her.
Who got it from hers, who got it from hers before that again.
All the way back to the first Coneellys.
They learned it from the dark woman, from Nuala.
Some tell it like that. Yes.
When you're out in dirty weather... it's like the lifeblood flowin' back into your veins.
- It's part of the backbone of a whale.
- Jamie brought it in.
Well.
You young ones did a great job on this thatching.
It'll have its test in a few minutes.
- It's a south wind, Grandfather.
- Aye.
They're often the most fearsome.
Jamie.
Poor little soul.
It's the little seal.
Do you feel it?
- Like snuffin' out a candle.
- Look!
Jamie!
Jamie, it's me, Fiona.
We've come back for you.
No, Jamie, don't go.
It's your family here.
Don't frighten him, dear.
Heavenly Father, look at that!
They're telling him to stay.
But he's afraid.
He's so afraid.
Come on, Jamie boy.
There you go, love.
We'll be staying here now.
Thank you.
Lord love his little heart.
He's hungry.
How did you live out there?
What did you eat?
I wouldn't think he could answer.
I'll teach you to talk, and I'll tell you stories.
Your friends who have been looking after you can see you any time they like.
Fiona's to thank for finding you, Jamie boy.
She gave me her word.
I just wouldn't believe it.
Will you look at us?
Back in Roan Inish.
It's like breathing fresh air after being three years on the ground.
Do you remember me, your sister Fiona?
Fiona.
He's destroyed with the excitement.
At least he'll sleep warm tonight.
{763}{817}What's this? Filipino New Year's?
{831}{869}No. Why you say that?
{871}{915}'Cause you're cooking a feast.
{917}{977}I can smell it from the interstate.
{985}{1039}What is that? Barbecue?
{1044}{1104}Yeah. But it not coming from here.
{1125}{1164}What is that noise?
{6232}{6294}What is your take on this, Jerry?
{6307}{6367}The people will love it, Mr. President.
{6375}{6485}Our conflict is whether we ambush|the 6:00 news or hold out for prime time.
{6489}{6545}Screw the press.|This is a need-to-know situation.
{6547}{6643}We should make it top secret,|and should move in with Defcon Four.
{6648}{6693}We can't sit on this.
{6733}{6792}General Casey, do you have an opinion?
{6825}{6855}Well, sir...
{6859}{6895}...do we know they are hostile?
{6897}{6943}What do you mean?
{6953}{7015}They have the planet surrounded|by thousands of warships!
{7017}{7063}Do we know they're warships?
{7147}{7221}Professor, what do we know about them?
{7261}{7313}They're very advanced technologically.
{7315}{7393}Which suggests, rightfully so,|that they're peaceful.
{7407}{7512}An advanced civilization is,|by definition, not barbaric.
{7515}{7551}Mr. President...
{7560}{7597}...this is a great day.
{7599}{7647}I and all my colleagues...
{7651}{7693}...are extremely excited.
{7704}{7726}Good.
{7755}{7812}Extraterrestrial life.
{7839}{7879}You're right, Jerry.
{7884}{7944}The people are going to love it.
{7947}{8004}This is a momentous occasion.
{8025}{8045}Mr. President--
{8047}{8091}We'll go all media on this.
{8095}{8137}I'll wear my Cerruti suit.
{8141}{8181}I'll need a good speech.
{8205}{8239}Statesman-like...
{8247}{8288}...historical and yet...
{8293}{8341}...warm, neighborly.
{8345}{8436}Abraham Lincoln meets|Leave it to Beaver, kind of thing.
{8472}{8511}Are they too old-fashioned?
{8513}{8551}No, I don't think so.
{8557}{8640}This has got the colors but, no.|I don't think so.
{8643}{8676}Not vivid enough.
{8681}{8729}Nancy had this in the library.
{8733}{8751}Yes, indeed.
{8753}{8783}I don't think so.
{8785}{8866}I thought perhaps the watered silk.|This week it's on sale.
{8875}{8940}I hardly think I need worry about that.
{8943}{9007}My husband is the leader of the free world.
{9036}{9071}What do you think?
{9087}{9184}Why don't you leave the Roosevelt Room|the way the Roosevelts wanted it.
{9201}{9303}Because Eleanor Roosevelt was|too fond of chintz. That's why.
{9313}{9363}Mother, this isn't your house.
{9367}{9441}lf you're going to be a pest, I'll ignore you!
{9447}{9474}Mrs. Dale?
{10012}{10076}I saw you fight Sonny Liston in '69.
{10080}{10106}Really?
{10110}{10162}You were a nun back then?
{10166}{10242}We've always been fight fans,|haven't we sisters?
{10250}{10304}Byron Williams, telephone.
{10308}{10334}I must go.
{10338}{10398}You ladies have a nice time.
{10533}{10565}Oh, Louise.
{10578}{10630}Sorry to call you at work, but...
{10642}{10742}...the boys haven't been home|in two nights. I don't know what to do.
{10746}{10796}You're doing the best you can.
{10802}{10844}They're just at that age.
{10894}{10977}The casino manager's giving me|the evil eye. I've gotta go.
{10980}{11022}I'll call you later, okay?
{11042}{11118}Are you still cool on me|coming to Washington?
{11122}{11162}'Course I am.
{11174}{11236}You take care, okay? Bye.
{11618}{11662}Must you drink in front of me?
{11664}{11714}You're an adult. Just cope.
{11718}{11794}It doesn't help me|that all we ever do is sit in bars.
{11798}{11842}This is work, baby, okay?
{11846}{11934}I'm checking the decor,|the lighting, the traffic flow.
{11938}{12010}lf I'd known you'd turn into a crook,|I wouldn't have married you.
{12012}{12058}I'm not a crook.
{12062}{12114}I'm ambitious. There's a difference.
{12116}{12182}lf you think you can make|a nickel in this town...
{12184}{12274}...without knowing how to dally|around a few curves, well...
{12282}{12346}...you know nothing|of the gambling industry.
{12382}{12480}The Galaxy's going to be|the best hotel in Vegas.
{12484}{12524}The best!
{12529}{12550}I promise.
{12552}{12614}But don't you realize what you're doing?|You're destroying the Earth!
{12616}{12686}All this greed! This money system!
{12690}{12742}You're destroying everything!
{12760}{12806}Okay, Barbara, okay.
{12814}{12864}Keep your voice down.
{12882}{12930}I got friends here.
{12962}{12985}Sugar!
{12994}{13028}Hit me one more time.
{13030}{13064}Stop flirting with the waitress.
{13066}{13098}God. Here.
{13136}{13178}Go over to the roulette...
{13216}{13258}...play our anniversary...
{13260}{13310}...and stay off of black.
{13386}{13406}Thanks.
{13611}{13675}Make it quick,|we go out live in ten minutes.
{13695}{13752}What? The actual president?
{13757}{13785}Cutting in?
{13887}{13963}Budget negotiations may be dead|in the water after this week.
{13965}{14004}Hair looks good.
{14037}{14063}I like the hair.
{14065}{14117}...quote, ''factually-challenged. ''
{14137}{14179}Yeah, Stone. Speak.
{14183}{14219}Jason, hi, it's me.
{14247}{14282}You wearing a bra?
{14293}{14384}Listen, this is big. President Dale|is cutting into my show today.
{14423}{14492}That's absurd. Why would he stoop|to being on ''Today in Fashion''?
{14494}{14529}He's interrupting everybody.
{14531}{14613}I don't know, it's some sort of|an emergency announcement.
{14617}{14682}This doesn't make sense.|He should talk to us.
{14707}{14756}White House is coming out live.
{14779}{14847}Good evening, my fellow Americans.
{14855}{14943}I apologize for interrupting|your regular programs...
{14947}{15019}...but I have a very important|announcement to make.
{15031}{15105}Many important things have happened|to me in my life:
{15117}{15171}My graduation from Princeton...
{15183}{15267}...the day that Marsha said|she would be my wife...
{15271}{15325}...the birth of our daughter Taffy.
{15329}{15353}Thanks, Dad.
{15355}{15467}And the news that I have heard today|ranks right up there.
{15473}{15527}A powerful memory is in the making.
{15543}{15585}Not just for me...
{15589}{15633}...but for all mankind.
{15640}{15664}Today...
{15665}{15751}...an extraordinary discovery|was made by the Hubble telescope.
{15802}{15872}The data from the Hubble was decoded...
{15892}{16003}...then analyzed by the most|powerful computers at MIT.
{16018}{16072}The images are undeniable.
{16084}{16160}We are entering the dawn of a new era.
{16188}{16280}Frame enlargements provide|an astonishing sight.
{16286}{16396}A fleet of vehicles,|which can best be described as...
{16402}{16440}...flying saucers.
{16444}{16520}Come on! Come on!|Papa needs a new pair of shoes!
{16592}{16656}Hey, am I the only one|shooting craps here?
{16660}{16749}We hope we will have the chance|to meet with them.
{16753}{16819}This is the perfect summation|to the 20th Century....
{16821}{16855}Martians.
{16869}{16915}This is great.
{16925}{16991}Please, come to Earth. Please.
{17007}{17039}We need you.
{17139}{17189}I got people coming in!
{17193}{17261}Everybody wants to be part of this.
{17263}{17331}Galaxy's going to be world class.
{17357}{17389}And soon...
{17393}{17465}...we will become one solar system.
{17477}{17509}What the hell's he talking about?
{17511}{17573}These flying saucers|have come from Mars...
{17615}{17677}...and at their current course and speed...
{17685}{17725}...will enter Earth's orbit in 16 hours.
{17727}{17821}I've been thinking about Martians|when there weren't any.
{17831}{17941}It is profoundly moving to know|there is intelligent life out there.
{17945}{17981}Glad it's somewhere.
{17983}{18075}Our world|will never feel quite the same again.
{18113}{18143}Good night...
{18167}{18212}...and God bless you all.
{18465}{18497}This...
{18519}{18557}...is intense.
{18621}{18671}Shut up, Poppy. Shut up.
{18697}{18729}Shut up!
{18745}{18774}Jason Stone.
{18843}{18873}It's for you.
{18917}{18977}Poppy, honey. No, sweetie.
{19017}{19069}That's right. Good girl.
{19163}{19202}I could be there at...
{19217}{19265}...I don't know, 11:00.
{19635}{19719}They want me to interview|the professor from the White House.
{19735}{19760}Kessler?
{19799}{19825}Donald Kessler?
{19827}{19876}Yeah, I think that was his name.
{19896}{19929}You know, the science guy.
{19931}{19975}This is nuts, this is....
{19983}{20029}We should have got that guy.
{20039}{20091}Your people are too slow.
{20123}{20153}Right, Poppy?
{20725}{20749}Finished!
{20751}{20795}One minute, 57 seconds.
{20831}{20885}-Didn't I tell you under two minutes?|-You did!
{20887}{20911}You did!
{20913}{20939}Hot damn.
{20957}{20990}Want a doughnut?
{20997}{21023}How old are they?
{21025}{21059}Fresh baked, Monday.
{21061}{21125}Richie, that's six days ago!
{21137}{21171}Give me a couple.
{21261}{21319}This Martian thing is pretty awesome.
{21323}{21413}Did one of you traitors see my Muffy?
{21417}{21459}Your brother's volunteering.
{21461}{21513}As soon as I get back to the base.
{21515}{21545}Volunteer for what?
{21547}{21583}Martian detail.
{21609}{21629}Cool.
{21631}{21717}lf any Martians come around here,|I'll kick their butts!
{22015}{22039}Jump!
{22268}{22328}Folks,|we must make an unscheduled stop!
{22409}{22437}It's Mama.
{22455}{22533}Why are you here?|lf you ain't home, why ain't you in class?
{22535}{22561}Class was cancelled.
{22563}{22597}It was not!
{22601}{22625}-Come here!|-Why?
{22627}{22670}I'm not going to hurt you.
{22681}{22711}Let go of him.
{22749}{22807}Okay. Now just come here.
{22815}{22845}Come here.
{22875}{22915}Think it's smart to cut school?
{22917}{22963}-What are you doing?|-Do you?
{22987}{23015}No, it's dumb.
{23017}{23061}You'll flunk! Go to jail!
{23065}{23109}Get on the bus!
{23113}{23139}Get on!
{23145}{23205}I'll be tripping on you. Get back there.
{23209}{23247}I don't want to hear anymore.
{23249}{23275}I hate school.
{23277}{23307}I heard that!
{23879}{23905}Hi, there.
{23907}{23935}Want a date?
{23939}{23973}How about it?
{23979}{24011}A date?
{24067}{24098}It sounds good.
{24151}{24195}The stress at work is...
{24203}{24241}...unbelievable.
{24372}{24414}May I speak to you in private?
{24416}{24483}No, I must watch the floor.|What do you want?
{24495}{24582}-I'm supporting a family back east.|-I thought you were divorced.
{24584}{24651}I am, but I still have to take care of them.
{24672}{24747}Things have been a little lean around here.
{24751}{24798}I was wondering if I could get a raise?
{24800}{24829}Out of the question.
{24831}{24908}I'm an asset to this hotel.|They like me around here.
{24912}{24952}You're a nice guy.
{24960}{25052}But I can get Leon Spinks|or Buster Douglas for the same money.
{25063}{25132}You better get moving.|You're on in five minutes.
{25352}{25412}This show's going to get a great rating.
{25431}{25462}It's all yours.
{25484}{25603}ln certain circumstances the proposition|that two and two equals five...
{25607}{25651}...is entirely legitimate.
{25692}{25726}Call me Nathalie.
{25736}{25803}And you, do please call me Donald.
{25836}{25872}I admire your show.
{25931}{25991}Really? You like my work?
{26000}{26047}Yes. Very much.
{26051}{26083}Why....
{26096}{26139}Thank you.
{26143}{26185}Coming out of commercial.
{26187}{26228}In five...four...
{26232}{26272}...three...two....
{26274}{26356}Welcome back.|We're with Professor Donald Kessler.
{26403}{26479}He's the chairman|of the American Academy...
{26483}{26540}...of Astronautics.
{26568}{26600}Professor...
{26607}{26688}...isn't it weird that we sent|a space probe to Mars...
{26692}{26742}...and we didn't even find anyone?
{26744}{26792}Well, not really...
{26796}{26825}...Nathalie.
{26836}{26892}We didn't get into the canals.
{26896}{26945}The Martian canals are canyons.
{26951}{27003}Some are over 100 miles deep.
{27008}{27124}The Martian civilization has clearly|developed under the planet's surface.
{27132}{27217}Their science and technology|must be absolutely mind-boggling.
{27236}{27258}So...
{27260}{27308}...what in your view, Donald...
{27324}{27350}...Kessler...
{27352}{27455}...Chairman, are some of the things|the Martians can teach us, Professor?
{27515}{27575}Quite a lot about Mars, Nathalie.
{27663}{27694}She's flirting.
{27700}{27780}But seriously,|this is tremendously exciting.
{27785}{27859}The knowledge, the new ideas:|it'll change everything.
{27869}{27915}And we must be open to it.
{27919}{27981}Maybe they can tell us about our universe.
{27983}{28015}How it started.
{28019}{28055}Where it's going.
{28059}{28113}Perhaps even its purpose.
{28131}{28169}It's tremendously exciting.
{28171}{28235}It's the most important event since...
{28243}{28297}...Jesus walked in Galilee--
{28313}{28341}Christ.
{28345}{28385}What's wrong?
{28389}{28419}Go to Camera Two!
{28421}{28455}I can't. It's busted.
{28457}{28501}Go to One! Go to Four!
{28659}{28693}He copped a feel.
{28755}{28783}Now what?
{29105}{29134}What's that?
{29139}{29177}So that's a Martian.
{29255}{29289}That's a Martian?
{29379}{29415}Oh, my God!
{29419}{29442}Yikes!
{29505}{29562}I'm not having that thing in my house.
{29599}{29631}Sweetie...
{29635}{29703}...we may have to.|The people expect me to meet them.
{29705}{29767}They're not eating off the Van Buren china.
{29813}{29849}Look at that brain.
{29863}{29901}He must be real smart.
{29905}{29953}It's gross!
{29971}{30013}Don't forget, Nathalie...
{30017}{30079}...that we will look equally gross to him.
{30199}{30251}He made the international sign|of the doughnut.
{30265}{30369}From the limited information available,|I've made three extrapolations. One:
{30373}{30441}Our Martian friend|is a carbon-based life form.
{30445}{30497}Two: He breathes nitrogen.
{30501}{30527}And three:
{30529}{30601}The large cerebrum here, indicates...
{30613}{30659}...telepathic potential.
{30669}{30705}You mean they can...
{30707}{30745}...read our thoughts?
{30783}{30819}Potentially, yes.
{30823}{30875}What about their intentions?
{30879}{30919}Are they friendly people?
{30921}{31037}Logic dictates that given|their high level of technical development...
{31045}{31091}...they're an advanced culture.
{31093}{31161}Therefore, peaceful and enlightened.
{31181}{31237}The human race, on the other hand...
{31247}{31319}...is an aggressively dangerous species.
{31341}{31415}Now I suspect they have|more to fear from us...
{31419}{31457}...than we from them.
{31477}{31501}Doctor.
{31511}{31538}Thank you.
{31565}{31657}For many years,|I've been refining a translating computer.
{31679}{31749}The results are not perfect, but this...
{31753}{31809}...may answer some of your questions.
{31948}{31986}Green skin...
{32004}{32056}...800 centuries ago.
{32066}{32104}Their bodily fluids...
{32108}{32168}...include the birth of half-breeds.
{32178}{32215}How many centuries did he say?
{32217}{32241}Eight hundred, sir.
{32243}{32298}Self-determination of the cosmos.
{32322}{32384}For dark is the suede that...
{32388}{32416}...mows...
{32422}{32472}...like a harvest.
{32486}{32533}What the hell does that mean?
{32894}{32922}Hey, Mitch.
{32924}{32955}Good morning.
{32958}{33044}I'm sorry, you can't come this way.|There's a tour in progress.
{33260}{33303}Hello, my name is Barbara.
{33305}{33345}Hello, Barbara.
{33361}{33461}I am an alcoholic,|but I haven't had a drink in three months.
{33620}{33700}I'm feeling so optimistic|because of the Martians.
{33716}{33774}We're not alone in the universe.
{33782}{33830}And it's so perfect...
{33834}{33919}...that it's happening at the beginning|of the new millennium.
{33924}{33970}Our planet was suffering...
{33974}{34056}...with the ozone and the rain forest and...
{34094}{34170}...so many people unhappy in their lives.
{34188}{34216}And then...
{34232}{34318}...the Martians heard|our global karmic cry for help.
{34332}{34368}People say they're ugly...
{34370}{34436}...but I think they've come|to show us the way.
{34486}{34542}I think they've come to save us.
{34613}{34640}Thank you.
{34944}{34970}Bye-bye.
{34972}{35042}You be careful. Don't get yourself killed.
{35046}{35080}Ain't she cute?
{35084}{35142}-We're real proud of you.|-Thanks, Dad.
{35174}{35208}Let me take this.
{35244}{35340}So long, retard. Don't touch|any of my stuff while I'm gone.
{35390}{35424}Bye-bye, Grandma.
{35428}{35458}Good-bye, Thomas.
{35460}{35494}It's Billy-Glenn, Grandma.
{35496}{35534}I know, Thomas.
{35580}{35612}Bye-bye, honey.
{35648}{35684}I must go.
{36000}{36037}Take care of my boy.
{36304}{36332}He'll be all right.
{36334}{36361}I hope so.
{36363}{36402}Army trains them good.
{36532}{36570}He's gone for a while.
{36590}{36650}Why can't you be more like your brother?
{36654}{36756}We got lucky with Billy-Glenn.|You can't expect the same luck twice.
{36770}{36846}Richie, want to make yourself useful|for a change?
{36850}{36876}Sure, Dad.
{36878}{36926}Take Grandma back to the home.
{37262}{37345}I bet you never thought you'd live|to see the Martians come.
{37356}{37402}It's pretty far out.
{37452}{37540}But think of all the crazy things|you must have seen.
{37552}{37636}I bet people were pretty scared|when they invented the train.
{37650}{37716}Come on, kid, I'm not that old!
{37800}{37830}Are you okay?
{37870}{37908}I want to see Slim.
{37912}{37944}I want to see...
{37948}{37978}...Slim...
{37982}{38014}...and Muffy...
{38024}{38056}...and Richie.
{38128}{38165}Grandma, I'm Richie.
{38202}{38248}I know, Thomas.
{38256}{38318}Richie was always the best one.
{38413}{38492}Right now the president|is talking to other world leaders.
{38494}{38580}They're preparing a list of issues|of common interest to discuss.
{38582}{38688}There is a unilateral, concerted,|diplomatic effort being made.
{38748}{38766}Jason.
{38768}{38786}Thanks.
{38788}{38880}lf the Martians land,|can the press do interviews?
{38900}{38936}Well, that depends.
{38938}{38990}We must establish contact...
{38994}{39046}...work out communication problems...
{39048}{39080}...establish parameters.
{39082}{39140}Then I guess we just see what happens.
{39148}{39186}Here's the president.
{39242}{39274}Good morning.
{39278}{39334}It's nice to see you all again.
{39338}{39428}I just have a few minutes for questions,|so let's get started.
{39432}{39462}Mr. President!
{39532}{39608}Do the Martians have two sexes,|like we do?
{40038}{40068}From Hollywood...
{40070}{40154}...we bring you the ''Lawrence Welk Show''!
{40280}{40384}Here he is, Mr. Music Maker himself,|Lawrence Welk.
{40606}{40698}This pussycat|is the most beautiful pussycat...
{40702}{40756}...in the whole world.
{40760}{40800}That's my Muffy.
{40916}{40984}Didn't you ever have|a pussycat of your own?
{40988}{41018}Sure, Grandma.
{41024}{41066}Music!
{41192}{41222}There you go.
{41334}{41376}You going to be okay?
{41398}{41494}lf you need anything,|any doughnuts or anything, call me.
{42123}{42155}How do?
{42185}{42267}Looks like you ain't got no wheels.|Come on...
{42275}{42309}...get in.
{42421}{42473}I'm going to do you a favor.
{42477}{42503}I owe you one.
{42505}{42603}I made a ton of money|on your last fight in '73.
{42607}{42646}The Quaker in Jamaica.
{42665}{42703}I'm glad somebody did.
{42707}{42757}Yeah, I know, I know.
{42761}{42798}It's rough on jocks.
{42811}{42855}You get to a certain age...
{42860}{42904}...opportunities dry up.
{42929}{42971}So here's the deal.
{42975}{43075}I got this chum, owes me a lot of money,|needs a wake-up call.
{43077}{43131}What I'd like you to do is...
{43135}{43205}...use that patented left hook on him.
{43227}{43297}Just in the ring, Art. Just in the ring.
{43301}{43361}Yeah, I'm hip, I'm hip, but...
{43375}{43423}...I'll give you two grand.
{43449}{43487}When you're done...
{43491}{43589}...all you must do is mosey on|by the office and get the cash.
{43595}{43645}Why do you want to come at me that way?
{43647}{43703}I'm trying to get back with my wife.
{43707}{43765}We had problems with this kind of shit.
{43785}{43827}But I've changed, man.
{43833}{43859}I found Allah...
{43861}{43921}...I don't eat pork, I'm a better man.
{43947}{44021}I faced that demon|and I don't want him coming again.
{44075}{44123}You gave up pork!
{44296}{44342}They're sending coordinates.
{44485}{44511}Where are they landing?
{44513}{44566}Pahrump. It's in the Nevada desert.
{44568}{44644}I can have my troops there at 0800 hours,|sir.
{44649}{44737}We must not send these people|the wrong message.
{44741}{44792}We need a welcome mat, not tanks!
{44796}{44905}What are you talking about? You can't|have Martians running all over Nevada!
{44909}{44939}You're right.
{44941}{45010}-Thank you, sir.|-This situation needs to be supervised.
{45012}{45048}Absolutely, sir.
{45052}{45088}General Casey...
{45093}{45133}...can you handle it?
{45149}{45175}I'd be proud.
{45177}{45236}Good, but keep a lid on it.
{45240}{45309}Key media, good cross-section of guests.
{45329}{45396}We don't want it to turn|into a zoo out there.
{45620}{45682}They don't know what|they're talking about!
{45684}{45737}Liberals, intellectuals...
{45741}{45797}...peacemongers, idiots!
{45837}{45893}Would you please keep it down?
{45897}{45937}People live here!
{46514}{46544}General Casey.
{46581}{46657}Yes, I get to greet the Martian ambassador.
{46669}{46709}Isn't that great?
{46713}{46782}Oh, it's a hell of an honor.
{46793}{46902}Didn't I always tell you if I stayed|in place and never spoke up...
{46906}{46965}...good things were bound to happen?
{48573}{48658}I want the Martians to be treated|like foreign dignitaries.
{48662}{48725}I want your men alert and majestic...
{48729}{48789}...with a snap in their step.
{48818}{48882}This must look good.|The world is watching.
{48884}{48910}Yes, sir.
{49034}{49091}Are you positive this thing will work?
{49117}{49158}Positively positive.
{49162}{49200}We don't want any slip-ups.
{49202}{49253}No, no, no, no. Not at all.
{49769}{49836}Poppy. All these people.
{49856}{49913}All of them here to see you.
{49980}{50024}There's Jason, Poppy!
{50332}{50368}Okay, let's go.
{50421}{50502}The teeming masses have gathered|from who knows how many states...
{50504}{50548}...waiting and watching.
{50553}{50586}Why have they come?
{50588}{50645}Curiosity? Or is it something more?
{50653}{50718}Or simply to say, 'I was there'?
{50729}{50762}'I was there...
{50766}{50804}'...when first man...
{50806}{50842}'...met Martian.'
{50857}{50879}Jason Stone...
{50881}{50913}...GNN...
{50917}{50942}...Pahrump.
{51734}{51762}Some room.
{51766}{51809}Give them room.
{53053}{53106}It is an awesome sight.
{53110}{53181}The giant spacecraft glinting...
{53185}{53249}...in the Nevada sun like a...
{53265}{53297}...giant...
{53309}{53345}...hubcap.
{53385}{53425}Something's happening.
{53561}{53594}The doorway...
{53598}{53628}...is opening.
{53729}{53774}A silver ramp...
{53778}{53814}...is coming out...
{53837}{53881}...like a giant tongue.
{54458}{54498}Gee whiz.
{55177}{55209}Martians!
{55233}{55274}Funny little critters.
{56206}{56234}Well?
{56257}{56279}Wait.
{56369}{56396}Greetings.
{56401}{56461}I am the Martian ambassador.
{56521}{56585}Everything is fixed now. You may speak.
{56589}{56621}Greetings.
{56625}{56663}I am General Casey...
{56665}{56777}...Commanding Officer of the Armed|Forces of the United States of America.
{56786}{56849}On behalf of the people of Earth:
{56853}{56878}Welcome.
{56898}{56932}He did that well.
{57658}{57694}We come in peace.
{57714}{57766}We come in peace. We come in peace.
{57884}{57936}They came in peace.
{58012}{58052}We come in peace.
{58756}{58782}Open fire!
{59540}{59568}What?
{60758}{60818}Die, you alien shithead!
{60976}{61005}I surrender!
{61188}{61250}No, it ain't happening! It didn't happen!
{62613}{62665}Holy Mother of God!
{62681}{62716}Did you see that?
{62720}{62803}We should hit these assholes|with everything we've got, sir.
{62817}{62854}Sir, Mr. President,|I know this seems terrible...
{62856}{62903}...but let's not be too rash.
{62905}{62942}We should nuke them!
{62953}{63020}We must establish|a line of communication first.
{63036}{63077}Set up a town hall.
{63081}{63130}We'll get the public's opinion.
{63177}{63220}What do you think?
{63261}{63304}Kick the crap out of them.
{63340}{63379}Ladies and gentlemen...
{63381}{63442}...it may be a cultural misunderstanding.
{63460}{63508}Maybe to them, doves mean war.
{63554}{63626}We all saw how they reacted to that dove.
{63634}{63670}It frightened them.
{63680}{63732}He did say that...
{63780}{63832}...''We come in peace.''
{64068}{64118}The new computer's ready.
{64122}{64170}Okay, let's do it.
{64174}{64236}I know we're making the right decision.
{64308}{64344}Ready to transmit.
{64394}{64484}This is the president of the United States.
{64506}{64550}I'm speaking in the hope...
{64554}{64635}...that what happened earlier today|in the Nevada desert...
{64644}{64720}...was a cultural misunderstanding.
{64740}{64810}There can be no doubt|that we two peoples...
{64814}{64892}...have a great deal to offer one another.
{64896}{64944}You must be as excited as we...
{64948}{65025}...to find intelligent life in the solar system.
{65052}{65098}Let me make it clear.
{65102}{65142}You have nothing...
{65146}{65194}...to fear from us.
{65204}{65280}Our customs may be strange to you...
{65284}{65348}...but we mean no harm.
{67074}{67136}When the investors fly in...
{67148}{67212}...I would like for them each to be...
{67244}{67280}...met by a limo.
{67304}{67362}Top of the line cars...
{67376}{67432}...leather interiors...
{67446}{67504}...Corinthian, if they got it.
{67524}{67606}Are you still spinning your wheels|on that cockamamie hotel?
{67640}{67670}Hello!
{67686}{67734}The Martians have attacked!
{67738}{67836}This was no misunderstanding.|I was there. I saw it.
{67840}{67898}Look, you're worried about yesterday.
{67906}{67954}I'm worried about tomorrow.
{67958}{68044}The Martians land on Earth,|they'll need a place to stay.
{68048}{68089}Just like everyone else.
{68108}{68144}My God.
{68176}{68242}Maybe we should all be destroyed.
{68266}{68342}The human race doesn't deserve to live.
{68510}{68538}Ethel...
{68542}{68584}...that reminds me.
{68588}{68646}I'd like the limos to be stocked...
{68650}{68724}...with every kind of alcohol|known to man.
{68728}{68794}And top it off with a bottle of Dom...
{68798}{68834}...on ice.
{68858}{68936}What confounds me most of all|is the lack of genitalia.
{68940}{68986}Down here is the aorta.
{68990}{69050}Up here we have the sphinx.
{69058}{69134}Notice the highly developed|nerve system here.
{69138}{69222}This explains, of course,|the cerebral arteries.
{69226}{69314}And if we notice down here,|behind the optic chiasm...
{69332}{69382}...several glands....
{69472}{69516}Very curious.
{70538}{70648}''He who believes in me,|though he die, yet shall he live.
{70670}{70766}''And whoever lives and believes in me|shall never die.''
{70794}{70874}Billy-Glenn Norris gave his life|defending our country.
{70878}{70924}Why did it have to be him?
{70928}{71024}He's a true American hero.|May God rest his soul.
{71064}{71108}Ready! Aim.
{71146}{71170}Fire!
{71204}{71230}Aim!
{71238}{71264}Fire!
{71568}{71597}Hello?
{71601}{71682}Byron! Is everything all right?|You still coming tomorrow?
{71684}{71768}Just try and stop me.|That plane arrives at 4:00 p.m.
{71773}{71809}Are the kids there?
{71813}{71845}Yeah, hold on.
{71921}{71961}-Me first.|-No, me.
{72048}{72067}Hey, Dad.
{72069}{72117}Who's that? Neville?
{72133}{72157}How are you?
{72159}{72205}We're going to the White House.
{72207}{72245}The White House?
{72249}{72279}Yeah, tomorrow.
{72283}{72331}-Give it back!|-Leave me alone.
{72335}{72389}It's a school thing, like a tour.
{72393}{72463}So you're still going to school|once in a while?
{72499}{72533}Give me your ma again.
{72535}{72559}Hold on.
{72561}{72581}Mom.
{72587}{72653}-You always get to the phone first.|-So what?
{72669}{72707}I'm first to the game.
{72757}{72831}Why are you wasting this phone time?|I'll see you tomorrow.
{72833}{72895}But there's something|I want to say to you.
{72899}{72957}Just 'cause I feel like saying it.
{72963}{72992}What's that?
{73009}{73043}I love you.
{73087}{73131}I love you too, Byron.
{73135}{73209}Now stop wasting money!|I'll see you tomorrow!
{73629}{73665}They're responding.
{73745}{73793}A message from the Martians.
{73851}{73873}Really?
{73875}{73925}They've issued a formal apology.
{73971}{74021}This is great!
{74039}{74085}I told you this would happen.
{74089}{74189}The Martian ambassador feels terrible|and wants to speak to Congress.
{74193}{74231}That's good, isn't it?
{74235}{74271}You bet.
{74285}{74341}It's a victory for our administration.
{76129}{76167}Ladies and gentlemen.
{76171}{76245}This is a proud day for all Americans.
{76259}{76337}This is a hell of a photo-op, Jerry.
{76351}{76403}Are you sure I shouldn't be there?
{76407}{76497}The Secret Service don't want|the executive branch...
{76501}{76575}...and the legislative branch|in the same room.
{76601}{76673}The Martian ambassador|is going to say a few words.
{76687}{76739}Come on down, Mr. Ambassador!
{78371}{78412}Mr. Ambassador, please!
{78551}{78575}Please!
{78581}{78627}This doesn't make sense!
{78631}{78679}It's not logical! It's not--
{78727}{78769}Guess it wasn't the dove.
{78815}{78837}Fire!
{78977}{79025}They blew up Congress!
{79555}{79605}Why'd they do that?
{79610}{79679}Maybe they don't like the human being.
{80110}{80146}Hello, gentlemen.
{80150}{80202}Nice of you to come on...
{80206}{80250}...such short notice.
{80272}{80308}General Decker...
{80312}{80370}...it seems I owe you an apology.
{80376}{80440}We all make mistakes, Mr. President.
{80444}{80490}Not anymore.
{80498}{80574}We're going to take charge of this thing!
{80580}{80637}Excellent. I have prepared the order.
{80654}{80682}What's this?
{80684}{80764}Your executive order for full use|of our nuclear deterrent.
{80852}{80914}Are you crazy? I'm not starting a war!
{80918}{81016}We're already at war, sir! We have|to nuke them! We must nuke them now!
{81046}{81128}General Decker, if you do not shut up...
{81138}{81192}...I'll relieve you of your command.
{81196}{81240}We must strike now, sir!
{81244}{81292}Annihilate! Kill! Kill!
{81304}{81328}Shut up!
{81332}{81386}Shut up! Shut up!
{82002}{82030}Now...
{82074}{82134}...I want the people to know...
{82138}{82216}...that they still have two out of three|branches of government...
{82218}{82282}...working for them, and that ain't bad.
{82286}{82404}I want the people to know|that the schools will still be open, okay?
{82418}{82474}And I want the people to know...
{82478}{82552}...that the garbage will still be carried out.
{82556}{82596}And I want a cop...
{82600}{82634}...on every corner.
{82636}{82680}Which, incidentally...
{82684}{82740}...we would already have...
{82744}{82816}...if they had listened to me|in the last election.
{82892}{82924}Jerry...
{82928}{82980}...how soon can we go on the air?
{83112}{83172}My fellow Americans.
{83184}{83236}It is with a heavy heart...
{83240}{83298}...that I speak to you this afternoon.
{83302}{83332}As you know...
{83334}{83452}...earlier today the Martian ambassador|and his confederates...
{83458}{83500}...attacked and killed...
{83504}{83604}...many of your representatives|on Capitol Hill.
{83618}{83730}I will be conferring|with other world leaders as time goes on.
{83748}{83842}And rest assured that, working together...
{83852}{83916}...we will soon come out...
{83938}{84008}...at a very real outcome.
{84062}{84096}Thank you.
{84792}{84834}Nathalie, is that you?
{84852}{84882}Yes.
{84886}{84914}How're you?
{84963}{85013}Not terribly good, I'm afraid.
{85058}{85100}May I ask you a question?
{85168}{85206}Of course you can.
{85234}{85292}Were you flirting with me on the show?
{85298}{85326}Because...
{85332}{85366}...if you were...
{85368}{85412}...I just want you to know...
{85414}{85458}...that I liked it.
{85494}{85524}You did?
{85528}{85552}Really?
{85554}{85636}Because, you know,|I've watched you on TV quite a bit and...
{85638}{85671}...well, I've...
{85682}{85754}...had something of|a schoolboycrush on you for...
{85758}{85788}...oh, gosh...
{85792}{85822}...ages.
{86808}{86835}Hi, there.
{86840}{86898}Are you interested in the White House?
{87022}{87082}I work there. I'm the press secretary.
{87086}{87114}Jerry Ross.
{87132}{87175}Have you ever heard of me?
{87214}{87277}You wouldn't believe|the pressure of my job.
{87318}{87370}It's nice to see a new face.
{87556}{87590}Are you doing anything?
{87592}{87642}'Cause if you want, I...
{87646}{87695}...could give you a personalized tour.
{87697}{87734}Would you like that?
{87791}{87865}Hey, Mitch, it's me. Can you let me in?
{87957}{88011}Hello, Mr. Ross. Sure.
{88015}{88075}We're a little nervous here,|after what happened.
{88077}{88103}Exactly.
{88327}{88397}Many great men and women|have passed through here.
{88411}{88463}Now we're passing through here.
{88475}{88525}Feels good, don't it?
{88605}{88649}You're very graceful.
{88667}{88697}I like that.
{88881}{88909}Come here.
{89401}{89451}We call this the Kennedy Room.
{89555}{89595}Pretty nifty, huh?
{90393}{90423}So...
{90427}{90465}...how about a drink?
{91187}{91233}Getting more comfortable.
{91289}{91323}Outstanding.
{91671}{91709}How's my lady doing?
{91957}{92007}Oh, missy, you're hot.
{92025}{92083}Could we get that gum out of your mouth?
{92241}{92273}My finger!
{92397}{92465}Hello! Hello, operator?|This is an emergency!
{92469}{92495}Help!
{94553}{94581}Don't shoot!
{94689}{94727}Don't worry, darling.
{94939}{94965}Get down!
{95213}{95247}Thank you, Mitch.
{95251}{95280}It's my job.
{96581}{96603}What's happening?
{96605}{96687}They appear to be|in a highly agitated state.
{96691}{96749}And I, I don't know.
{96765}{96803}I honestly don't know.
{96807}{96879}I don't know what's going on anymore.|This is frustrating.
{96881}{96922}I'm not feeling myself.
{96931}{96981}lf only I could hold you in my arms!
{96983}{97021}Oh, Donald!
{97025}{97064}I'm scared!
{97883}{97909}Excuse me.
{97913}{97981}You said you wanted to know|as soon as possible.
{97985}{98011}What is it?
{98013}{98043}It's NO2.
{98047}{98089}Highly concentrated.
{98093}{98125}Nitrogen.
{98137}{98169}So...
{98175}{98247}...that's how it could breathe|in our atmosphere.
{98267}{98311}What's that noise?
{99078}{99154}But, Theodore,|I simply do not feel that Lincoln....
{99164}{99204}It's a full-scale invasion.
{99206}{99248}We must get you to safety.
{99390}{99420}Not this way?
{99422}{99482}I'm sorry, there's a tour going through.
{99496}{99592}The Blue Room is often considered|the most beautiful in the White House.
{99596}{99672}It is often used by the president|to receive guests.
{99692}{99764}It is furnished to represent|the period of James Monroe.
{99766}{99795}What's that?
{99805}{99837}That...
{99841}{99903}...is a portrait of James Monroe.
{101147}{101183}We lost Taffy!
{101293}{101379}Keep moving,|we must get you to the back stairs!
{101535}{101581}The Nancy Reagan chandelier!
{102036}{102108}What are you gawking at?|Get that president out of here!
{102261}{102309}I personally guarantee...
{102319}{102402}...that you will get a complete return|on your investment...
{102405}{102453}...within five months.
{102457}{102503}Mr. Land, excuse me.
{102507}{102585}Just a second, Sheik Rakula.
{102633}{102651}Now...
{102653}{102753}...even in a time of so-called|intergalactic emergency...
{102781}{102813}...the people...
{102817}{102881}...still want to roll them bones!
{102917}{102953}I believe--
{102965}{103009}Just five more minutes.
{103031}{103103}What I'd like for you to do is to...
{103107}{103187}...view our new,|state-of-the-art show room.
{103219}{103275}It is out-of-sight!
{103313}{103340}Gentlemen.
{103437}{103485}There is no way...
{103489}{103533}...that we can lose.
{104617}{104697}''It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
{104741}{104827}''It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
{104863}{104949}''But when I see you hanging|about with anyone
{104994}{105058}''It's not unusual to see me cry
{105104}{105152}''I want to die''
{105172}{105216}I've called you all day.
{105220}{105254}The flight's been canceled.
{105256}{105316}Byron, there's Martians everywhere!
{105338}{105361}Hello?
{105400}{105434}I can't hear you!
{105569}{105611}I must get to Washington.
{105733}{105776}Do you know anyone who can fly a plane?
{105778}{105806}Your husband, Art.
{105808}{105834}He's dead.
{105838}{105875}I told him this would happen.
{105877}{105929}I loaded the plane with supplies.
{105936}{106040}I want to go to the Tahoe caves.|It's remote, the Martians won't find it.
{106050}{106074}Where's the plane?
{106076}{106142}Private airfield. Other side of the freeway.
{106146}{106188}Will it fly to Washington?
{106192}{106236}I want to go to Tahoe.
{106240}{106284}''You find it happens
{106288}{106340}''All the time
{106354}{106412}''Love will never do
{106428}{106476}''What you want it to
{106498}{106546}''Why can't this crazy love
{106556}{106604}''Be mine''
{106818}{106850}Jesus Christ!
{107067}{107103}Girls, get out!
{107325}{107383}There's a Martian right behind me!
{107387}{107451}You're Tom Jones! ''It Ain't Unusual.''
{107479}{107505}Autograph?
{107507}{107558}Anybody got a pen?
{107993}{108025}Great punch.
{108029}{108063}You'll need that gun.
{108065}{108107}-I'm Tom Jones.|-Byron Williams.
{108109}{108163}I saw you fight in Cardiff, Wales.
{108195}{108223}You okay?
{108233}{108287}-I need a drink.|-You and me both.
{108291}{108339}-We better go.|-Can you fly a plane?
{108341}{108363}Sure. Got one?
{108365}{108391}She has.
{108859}{108925}Don't run, we are your friends.
{109669}{109707}Martians blew up the shop!
{109709}{109731}You're kidding.
{109733}{109759}Should I get Grandma?
{109761}{109845}Forget her! She's halfway|to outer space already! Here!
{109849}{109925}I'll tell you one thing.|They ain't getting the TV!
{110013}{110081}The president of France is on line two.
{110173}{110251}Mr. President, the president of France|is on line two.
{110255}{110299}He says it's important.
{110433}{110485}Hello, Maurice.
{110549}{110589}I have good news.
{110593}{110629}The Martian ambassador is here.
{110631}{110685}We've negotiated a settlement.
{110733}{110789}Maurice get out of the room.
{110793}{110829}Get out, now!
{111923}{111953}Mr. President.
{112011}{112053}Mr. President.
{112057}{112119}I need you to sign this!
{112233}{112269}What is it?
{112273}{112331}My last will and testament?
{112335}{112431}It is an order to deploy|our nuclear capability, sir.
{114153}{114199}What the hell was that?
{116652}{116674}Look!
{116852}{116882}What was that?
{116931}{116957}Where you going?
{116959}{116985}To get Grandma.
{116987}{117034}Stay and defend this trailer!
{117036}{117087}That's what Billy-Glenn would do.
{117091}{117129}You're disgracing a hero!
{117131}{117191}I don't care. I'm gonna go get grandma.
{117207}{117240}Come back here!
{117559}{117601}What in the hell is that?
{117780}{117812}Cut it out!
{117944}{117977}Stop it!
{118191}{118218}-This way!|-No, this way!
{118220}{118279}It's a short cut! The airfield's--
{118283}{118343}Bullshit! The airfield's over there!
{118483}{118577}Being dressed like King Tut|doesn't make you our leader!
{118580}{118616}Look, this is wrong!
{118620}{118712}We're lost! He led us down a maze!|I'm going back to the hotel.
{118716}{118748}-This way!|-Wait!
{118752}{118796}Where are you going?
{118800}{118818}Come on.
{118820}{118856}But, I like him.
{119011}{119115}Assholes! Why'd I listen to them?|I should have stayed in the hotel.
{119129}{119163}Shit!
{119228}{119264}I surrender, okay?
{119276}{119331}You understand what that means?
{119360}{119424}Look! You're intelligent beings.
{119439}{119492}Let's cut a deal. I can help.
{119496}{119531}I'm a lawyer!
{119539}{119621}You want to conquer the world,|you'll need lawyers, right?
{119660}{119684}Here.
{119705}{119744}You want my watch?
{119756}{119820}Take it. Take it. It's a Rolex!
{120072}{120107}Nice shot!
{120111}{120145}Pity I was too late.
{120147}{120192}Can I have the gun back?
{120197}{120243}Give me the gun and come on!
{122036}{122060}Grandma!
{122261}{122292}Oh, my God!
{122631}{122688}I think these guys are very sick.
{122708}{122773}What's happening to them?|What's killing them?
{122808}{122865}I think it must be my music.
{123052}{123086}Quiet!
{124324}{124386}You think you can do anything you want.
{124390}{124424}You can't.
{124428}{124448}Because...
{124450}{124504}...we are human...
{124512}{124536}...beings.
{124538}{124624}And we have the United States Army...
{124648}{124686}...that'll fight you...
{124688}{124786}...to the last man!|And we'll never surrender!
{124878}{124916}Do you hear me?
{124920}{124990}We'll fight you on the beaches.|We'll fight you in the streets.
{124992}{125052}We will never, never surrender!
{125056}{125112}We will win!
{125116}{125160}Democracy will survive!
{125166}{125210}We will never, ever...
{125214}{125252}...surrender!
{125256}{125288}We will win!
{125292}{125340}The eagle will be triumphant!
{126060}{126096}Why...
{126102}{126144}...are you doing this?
{126194}{126222}Why?
{126250}{126316}lsn't the universe big enough...
{126330}{126370}...for both of us?
{126464}{126514}What is wrong with you people?
{126584}{126624}We could work together.
{126652}{126702}Why be enemies?
{126726}{126768}Because we're different?
{126794}{126834}Is that why?
{126934}{126998}Think of the things that we could do.
{127032}{127102}Think how strong we would be!
{127146}{127182}Earth...
{127202}{127248}...and Mars...
{127274}{127304}...together.
{127367}{127435}There is nothing|that we could not accomplish.
{127460}{127502}Think about it!
{127556}{127602}Think about it!
{127638}{127678}Why destroy...
{127698}{127750}...when you can create?
{127782}{127830}We can have it all...
{127850}{127908}...or we can smash it all!
{127992}{128028}Why can't we...
{128034}{128088}...work out our differences?
{128118}{128164}Why can't we...
{128172}{128224}...work things out?
{128284}{128336}Little people...
{128392}{128442}...why can't we all just...
{128472}{128514}...get along?
{129158}{129187}What's this?
{130104}{130166}Don't run. We are your friends.
{130204}{130266}Don't run. We are your friends.
{130589}{130633}Next stop, radio station.
{130703}{130739}There it is!
{130755}{130793}Let's move it!
{131223}{131255}There it is.
{131287}{131337}Go start it. Go with him.
{131341}{131379}Cindy, come with me.
{131793}{131831}Are you sure you can fly this?
{131833}{131873}I think so, yeah.
{131931}{131965}Who put that on?
{131997}{132063}-It's stuck!|-Cindy, over here.
{132219}{132247}Shit!
{132269}{132325}They haven't seen us yet. Come here.
{132375}{132409}Get in the plane.
{132419}{132463}I'll distract them.
{132467}{132521}The first chance you get, go.

My name is Ash, and I am a slave.
- Aah !
Close as I can figure it, the year is 1300 A.D., and I'm being dragged to my death.
It wasn't always like this.
I had a real life once.
A job.
Ash to price check four.
Um, hardware, aisle 12.
Shop smart.
Shop S-mart.
I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda.
Together, we drove to a small cabin in the mountains.
It seems an archaeologist had come to this remote place... to translate and study his latest find,
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"
"The Book of the Dead."
Bound in human flesh and inked in blood, this ancient Sumerian text contained bizarre burial rites, funerary incantations and demon resurrection passages.
It was never meant for the world of the living.
The book awoke something dark in the woods.
It took Linda.
- And then it came for me.
It got into my hand and it went bad.
So I lopped it off at the wrist.
But that didn't stop it.
It came back.
- Big time.
Ah !
Aah !
My God !
How do you stop it ?
- Surround the stranger !
All right, you men, fall in !
All o' ya, keep a pace !
Where in the hell--
Stand fast, hellhound !
No, no.
Easy now, chief.
Uh, I don't know how I got here,
- and, uh, uh, I'm not looking for any trouble.
What a piece of armor this is !
- Wise man !
- Fall back ! Come on, all you men.
Back on your horses.
Come on !
My lord, I believe he is the one written of in the Necronomicon.
He who's prophesied to fall from the heavens... and deliver us from the terrors of the Deadites.
What, that buffoon ?
Likely... he's one of Henry's men !
- Kneel, rapscallions !
I say to the pit with him !
You shall soon learn the horrors of the pit.
- To the pit !
- You miserable bast--
- Get him !
- Get off of me !
- Let me go !
- Chain him !
Ah, you're gonna have a little bit of wee fun, mate.
To the castle !
Pick up your feet !
Stop draggin' your feet !
Come on !
Move along !
Come on, now.
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this !
You men got something to look forward to... when you get back to the castle.
Lord Arthur approaches !
Raise the portcullis !
Lord Arthur !
Lord Arthur approaches !
That's lovely, isn't it ?
Move it in.
Move it, you worthless--
- Get on !
Move it up, boys.
God save the king !
God save the king.
We love him !
Arthur !
He's back !
Lord Arthur, where is my brother ?
Did he not ride with you ?
Aye, and fought valiantly.
But last night he fell in battle to Duke Henry's men.
I'm sorry, Sheila.
Come on.
You cretin !
Ah, stop it, you bastard !
You barbarian !
- Oh, no ! Stop it ! Stop it !
Get outta here, you little brat !
Foul thing !
A pox on you, brute !
Thou art a murderer !
A black murderer !
My brother's death shall be avenged !
Company, halt !
Get that yoke off 'im !
Kill them !
Put them into the pit !
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.
Who are you ?
Who wants to know ?
I am Henry the Red,
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands and leader of its peoples.
Well, hello,
Mr. Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal. You ain't leadin' but two things right now--
Jack and shit, and Jack left town.
Shut your bleedin' hole !
Shut your bleedin' hole !
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur !
There is an evil awakened in this land, and while my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Henry the Red, wage war on us !
Charlatan !
Aah !
It was you who first turned your swords on us !
And this evil has befouled my people as well !
Your people are no better than the foul corruption... that lies in the bowels of that pit.
Right, you're no better.
May God have mercy upon your souls.
God's name !
What hell-spawned thing lurks there ?
Into the pit with those bloodthirsty sons of 'hores !
No ! No !
No, no ! Aah !
Oh ! Heavenly God !
He's escaping !
- Hold to !
- Hold him !
- Who's next ?
- It's him. Aye, he trembles !
They don't look so clever now, do they ?
He's frightened !
He's frightened white !
Whoa ! Whoa !
Wait a minute. Hold it.
W-Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.
I never even saw these assholes before.
- Get him in there !
- He trembles !
He's begging !
- What are you waitin' for ?
- Henry !
You gotta tell him you don't know me.
We never met.
Tell him.
I do not think he'll listen, lad.
Look.
I'm tellin' you, you got the wrong guy.
I'm tellin' you, you got the wrong guy.
Uh, wh-whoa.
- Aah !
How do you like the pit ?
Isn't the pit wonderful ?
- Hai-ya !
- Why, you--
Ha !
Spikes.
Hey ! He says, "Spikes."
Give him spikes !
Make way !
Strange one !
- Strange one !
Yaaah !
Yes !
Damn you.
Damn you !
You know, your shoelace is untied.
All right.
Who wants some ?
Who's next, huh ?
How 'bout it ?
Who wants some, huh ?
Who wants to have a little ?
You.
You want some more ?
Huh ?
You want a little ?
Do ya ? Do ya ?
Do ya want some more?
Huh ? Huh ?
Now get on those horses and get outta here.
Let 'em go !
- Halt !
Thank you, generous hosts !
Sword boy !
For that arrogance,
I shall see you dead.
Yeah.
All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up.
See this ?
- This is my boom stick !
It's a 12-gauge, double-barreled Remington.
S-mart's top of the line.
You can find this in the sporting goods department.
That's right. This sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Retails for about $109.95.
It's got a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.
That's right, shop smart.
Shop S-mart.
You got that ?
- Yes, sir. Right.
- Yes, sir.
Now I swear, the next one of you primates... even touches me--
Now, let's talk about how I get back home.
I prithee to forgive me, m'lord.
I believed thee one of Henry's men.
First you wanna kill me, now you wanna kiss me.
Blow.
So what's the deal ?
Can you send me back or not ?
Only the Necronomicon has the power.
An unholy book which we also require.
Within its pages are passages that can send you back to your time.
Only you, The Promised One, can quest for it.
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit.
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto, today, chop--
- You shall die !
You shall never obtain the Necronomicon !
We shall feast upon your souls !
Oh !
- It's a trick. Get an axe.
- Guards, stop it !
- Catch the witch !
- Death to the witch !
Have some porridge !
Ah, my eyes ! I'm blind !
Oh, God, I'm blind !
No, don't !
Yo, she-bitch.
- Let's go.
Ya-hoo !
Hee-ya !
- Hee-ya !
If the Necronomicon fell into the hands of the Deadites, all mankind will be consumed by this evil.
Now will thou quest for the book ?
That one.
Hee-ya !
Groovy.
What's the matter ?
You raised in a barn ? Shut the door.
Probably was raised in a barn with all the other primitives.
The wise men say that thou art The Promised One.
'Tis said that thou wilt journey for the book to help us, and that thou wilt lead our people against the evil.
The only reason I'm going to get the book is to get home.
I believe that thou wilt be leaving in the morning.
Don't touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect... wouldn't understand alloys and compositions... and things with molecular structures in the--
What are you doin' here anyway ?
I wanted to say that all of my-- all of my hopes and prayers go with you, and I made this for thee.
Good, I could use a horse blanket.
Gimme some sugar, baby.
Hyah ! Come on, boy !
Hyah !
Hyah !
- Steady now. Whoa.
What ? What is it ?
This path will lead you to an unholy place.
A cemetery. There, the Necronomicon awaits.
When thou retrievest the book from its cradle, you must recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Klaatu barada nikto.
Okay.
Well, repeat them.
- Klaatu barada nikto.
- Again !
I got it, I got it !
I know your damn words, all right ?
Now you get this straight, the both of you.
If I get that book, you send me back.
After that,
I'm history. Hyah !
What is it, boy ?
Hyah ! Come on !
Hyah ! Come on !
Aah ! Come on !
Come on, you !
Hey, let's scare this guy good ! Come on.
Ramming speed !
Ooh !
Ready, aim, fire !
- Ooh !
- Get away !
Whoa !
- Oh, God ! Oh, no !
- Oh--
- Oh !
- You lousy little--
Oh, no !
Ooh, no ! Oh, my !
Uh, ooh, aah !
- Lift up !
- Oh, ooh-hoo-ha !
- Ooh, aah !
Aah-ha-ha !
Heh heh heh-heh--
Whoa !
## London Bridge is falling down #
# Falling down #
# Falling down #
- # My fair lady ## Ha !
Ooh !
Is he up ?
How is he ?
Hey, he's gettin' up.
Hmm, what a horrible nightmare.
Wait a minute.
Oh, God !
I can't move !
Aah !
- And go !
- Open wide.
Geronimo !
- Hooray !
- Hooray !
- Ah !
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh ?
How'd you like the taste of that, huh ?
How'd you like the ta--
Aah, uh, ugh, oh !
Ah ! Oh !
Let me out !
Oh, dear God, it's growing bigger !
Ooh, ooh, I'm blind.
I'm blind. Bleh.
Yip, yip, yah !
Oh, hey ! Where are you takin' me ?
Uh, oh, ooh !
What are you ?
Are you me ?
I'm bad Ash, and you're good Ash.
You're goody little two-shoes.
## You're goody little two-shoes goody little two-shoes #
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #
- Ow !
# Little goody two-shoes ##
Aah !
Good, bad.
I'm the guy with the gun.
That'll teach you.
Yeah, that'll teach you.
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon !
You'll die in the graveyard before you get it !
- What's that you got on your face ?
- Huh ?
I'll come back for you !
- Hyah !
Come on, boy !
Hyah !
Three books ?
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Nobody said anything about three books.
L-Like what am I supposed to do ?
Take one book, or all books, or, or what ?
Well.
Whoa. Wrong book.
Ow !
Aah ! Ooh !
Ooh ! Ooh, you !
I'll get back to you.
Well...
Well... seems fairly obvious.
Ooh, wait a minute. The words.
All right, all right, all right.
Say the words.
Klaatu... barada...
Iu-- necktie.
Nectar, n-- nickel.
Noodle.
It's an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.
Klaatu barada n--
Okay, then.
That's it.
Hey. Wait a minute.
Everything's cool.
I said the words. I did !
- Oh ! Oh ! No, wait ! Oh !
You people, seek cover !
To the parapet !
Seek your children !
- Steady the horses !
Something's wrong.
Something's amiss.
Where'd you go ?
Where'd you g--
Oh, oh, aah !
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ow ! I'll crush ya !
I'll mash ya into paste, you bony cre--
- Hyah !
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.
Now I want back, like in the deal. Hyah !
I... live... again.
There ! The Promised One !
The Promised One's returned !
Raise the portcullis !
Welcome home !
We're saved !
- The Necronomicon !
- Truly he is The Promised One !
- He's brought the Necronomicon !
- How are ya ?
- He's brought the book !
- Yeah, great, great.
- Good boy !
- Get the fuck outta my face !
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon ?
- Yeah, it's, it's just that--
- Just what ?
Nothin'.
Here.
Now send me back.
Like in the deal.
When you removed the Necronomicon from the cradle, did you speak the words ?
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words ?
Look, maybe I didn't say every single, little tiny syllable,
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
- Dung-eating fool !
Thou hast doomed us all !
When thou misspoke the words, the army of the dead awoke !
Now, whoa, whoa, right there, spinach chin.
You said you could clean this mess up once you got that book.
You said there was a passage that could get rid of this thing and send me back.
It's true, the book still possesses the power to send you back, but to us it is useless !
The evil has a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon, and it will come here to get it.
We had a deal.
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for ya.
I did my part, now you send me back.
Very well.
As we are men of our word, we shall honor our bargain.
The wise men shall return you to your own time.
Yeah ?
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.
'Cause that was the deal.
So when do you think we can... start with all the thing and the--
He's nothin' but a traitor, he is !
When do you think we can start... with all the, uh, ceremony and, uh--
Agh ! Wretched excuse for a man !
The wise men were fools to trust in you.
I knew he couldn't be trusted.
We put our trust in him.
I still believe that thou wilt help us.
Oh, Sheila, don't you get it ? It's over.
I didn't have what it took.
So long.
But what of the things that we've shared ?
What of all the sweet words that you spoke in private ?
Aw, well--
Well, that's just what we call
"pillow talk," baby. That's all.
It was more than that.
I still have faith in thee.
I still believe that thou wilt stay and save us. I--
Coward !
- Look there ! A demon !
Ash ! Help me !
Sheila !
Yaaah !
- Shoot the bloody thing !
- Hold your arms ! You'll hit the girl !
Uh, me sword !
Yaaah !
Damn you !
Dig, damn you !
Dig faster !
I shall command every worm-infested son-of-a-bitch...
- that ever died in battle !
- Thank you, sir !
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.
We shall storm their castle and get my book !
Hoist, you damnable varlets !
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Now pick up a shovel and get digging !
- Bring on the wench !
- Gimme some sugar, baby.
Well.
Now, ain't you a sweet little thing ?
Don't touch me, you foul thing !
Come on.
That's it.
We got plans for you, girly-girl.
Move !
Have you lost your bones, you decomposed gobs ? Get thee hence !
A scout approaches !
- Whoa !
- Hey, get his horse.
Arise.
My lord, an army of the dead gather in the wilderness.
- They approach the castle.
- How far from here?
But two days' ride.
These winged ones are only the first of them.
Perhaps we should leave as soon as possible.
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.
- We must flee !
- It is written. It has been foretold.
- They'll take our souls.
They'll swallow our souls.
- I'm afraid !
- I don't want to die !
That's it.
Go ahead and run.
Run home and cry to mama !
Me ?
I'm through runnin' !
I say we stay here and fight it out.
Are all men from the future loudmouthed braggarts ?
Nope. Just me, baby.
Just me.
How will we fight an army of the dead at our castle walls ?
How will you fight that ?
More words ?
Most of our people have already fled.
We are but 60 men.
Then we'll get Henry the Red and his men to fight with us.
Now... who's with me ?
I'll stand by ya.
You can count on my steel.
I'll offer up my courage.
- Me sword's by his side.
- I'm with you !
- I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
- And mine !
We'll stay !
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail ! Hail !
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.
- There's a sight for sore bones.
I may be bad, but I feel... good.
- Who rules ?
- To you, my lord.
You, sir. To the castle.
The castle !
Hurry up now.
The castle ! Let's push.
Heave-ho.
Good. Yeah.
Ha ! Hoo !
Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Yeah !
They're coming !
The Deadites approach !
There's so damn many of 'em.
Maybe--
Just maybe my boys can stop 'em from gettin' the book.
Yeah.
And maybe
I'm a Chinese jet pilot.
Battle stations ! All right, get those rocks up, mister, on the double !
Ready the catapults !
By God, let's give 'em what for.
And halt !
- Company, halt !
- Company, halt !
I'll rip his balls off.
Bring forth the scout !
Whoa.
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.
Fine, fine, fine.
Where are they keeping my book ?
There, my lord, beyond the wall.
The parapet. That would be the most likely place.
Right. Bring me forth into that castle !
- Forward !
- Forward !
Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war !
To the castle !
Fly, mate ! Fly !
Death to the mortals !
Arrows.
Torch boy !
Steady.
Fire !
- Advance, you beasts, advance !
Oh ! Oh !
Yeah, baby !
- All right !
Sire, there's a second division approaching from the south.
Ram the gate !
Catapults.
Catapults out !
Yeah !
Fire !
Look there !
Yeah !
- Seek cover !
- Watch out !
- Make way !
Oh !
Oh, you miserable bags of bones !
Pick yourselves up and sally fo...
Sally for--
Sally forth.
Come on, you miserable wretches.
Lower.
Heave !
Forward !
Buttress the door, now !
Hold fast !
- Back !
- Stone these creatures !
Damn you !
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
Go, you creatures !
Arrows !
Load !
Fire !
- Heave ! Put your... backbones into it.
We've broken through !
The castle is ours !
Kill the mortals !
- Get it achieved and fast !
Their ranks are broken !
Have at them !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Pull back !
Man the parapet !
Protect the book.
God save us all.
Say hello to the 21st century. Yeah !
Come on !
I got plenty for everybody !
Look out !
- Whoo !
- Bye-bye.
It's the one in the cart we want !
Get him !
- Yaaah !
Yaaaaah !
Sheila ?
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.
Excellent.
Ooh ! Hey ! Look out !
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie.
Get off of her !
Gotcha !
Damn you !
- My lord.
- Stay with the book.
The book's where we are.
The Red ! The Red !
Duke Henry and his men have come !
Blows, blood... and death !
Duke Henry ! Ha-ha !
Die !
Onward, valiant cousins !
Their ranks are broke !
Oops !
Hello !
There ya go.
The book is mine.
I'll cut your gizzard out.
- Hey, where'd he go ?
Come to papa.
Get him !
Oh, you crazy bitch, get off of me !
Ha !
Right.
You found me beautiful once.
Honey, you got real ugly.
There we are.
So you wanna play rough, eh ?
Okay.
Oh.
All right, all right.
Prepare to die !
You're going down !
- I'm goin' up.
- I'm comin' for ya.
Come on !
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Come on.
All right !
You're pissin' me off, you ugly son of a bitch !
I'll spoil those good looks.
Back-stabber !
Hold still !
Tallyho !
- We can't hold the battlements!
We will hold !
We must protect the book !
I got a bone to pick with you.
Come on.
Slice that gizzard open.
Now you're mine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
At last, the book.
I possess the Necronomicon.
I've crushed your pathetic army.
Now I'll have my vengeance.
Buckle up, bonehead,
'cause you're goin' for a ride.
Huh ?
Victory's ours !
- Retreat ! Retreat !
- Let's get the hell out of here !
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.
If it's a fight you want--
Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrust worthy lot.
Move yourself, lad !
- Your hand, man. Godspeed !
- Hey, Henry. Yeah, nice goin'.
- My lady.
- Arthur.
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day.
- Yeah !
- Yeah !
We're brothers and a new kingdom shall be born !
The book tells us that once you drink this liquid... and recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto," thou shalt awaken in thine own time.
Remember, you must recite the words exactly.
Hyah !
I thought about staying.
They offered me the chance to lead them, to teach them, to-- to be king.
- Uh-huh.
- But my place is here.
- So I swallowed the juice, said the words and here I am.
- Did you say... the words right this time ?
Well, maybe I didn't say every single, tiny little syllable, no, but basically
I said 'em, yeah.
Basically.
You know that story about how you could've been king ?
I, uh, I think it's kind of cute.
Yeah.
- Die !
Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the store.
Who the hell are you ?
Name's Ash.
Housewares.
I'll swallow your soul.
Come get some.
Sure, I could've stayed in the past.
Could've even been king.
But in my own way,
I am king.
Hail to the king, baby.
So, here's the deal.
We are in the garden, right?
And everything is great.
And there's this tree.
And the man says,
"Ooh, see that tree?
"Don't eat the fruit of that tree.
"That apple you do not eat."
He goes inside, names some animals... maybe takes a dump.
Anyway, what does she do?
She eats the apple!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!
He says, "Don't eat it!"
She eats it!
Unbelievable!
Since then, men, women...
I don't know.
It's all going wrong!
So inviting
So exciting
Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer
Closer to your arms
Then suddenly
Your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Of make-believe
Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony...
Divorce.
Miserable marriage.
Wedding canceled.
Remarried.
Divorced again.
Ahh!
Irreconcilable sexual disharmony!
Dysfunctional marriage!
Divorce! Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!
Well?
Talk to me.
We had a bad run.
Things have changed down there.
Men and women aren't like they used to be.
Well, things are changing up here as well.
I'm getting pressure from above... if you know what I mean, for results!
For men and women to be bonded in eternal bliss.
In the meantime, I've been instructed to introduce... new incentive schemes for our leading operatives.
Leading operatives, huh?
That's you.
Skip the flattery,
Gabriel. Where's the beef?
It's a hard case to crack.
I have full confidence you can do it.
If you don't... you don't come back.
What?
No way.
That's the new incentive scheme.
Your mission is to unite man and woman... blah, blah, blah, blah, OK?
When you're done... you come back.
If youfail... you stay down there forever.
You are not serious.
Liberatum mani.
It's out of my hands.
No ordinary sin
This perfect working order
I'd rather sink than swim
If I can't walk on water
Let the scandal in
This perfect world disorder
I'd rather drown than swim
I can't walk on water
This taste of dilution
Velvet divorce
I get bored

She's the secret daughter... of Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy, right?
I mean, that's why Marilyn was murdered.
So, the young girl grows up in an orphanage... unaware of her incredible parentage.
Years go by.
She's beautiful.
She's smart.
She's successful, OK?
Then what?
Well, then...
Then she gets sent to London as U.S. ambassador.
Where she discovers who she is... and also unravels the secret of the Nazi gold... hidden underneath the embassy.
Uh, yeah.
It's kind of obvious, Robert.
Of course it's obvious, guys.
It's a trash novel.
You buy it in the airport, you take it on holiday.
Oh, Ms. Gesteten.
Nice to see you down here.
I'd love to stay and talk, but, um, you know how things...
Nice trick, Celine.
- Want to try your luck?
- With the gun?
With the fruit.
I don't have time for games.
If you're afraid, why don't you just say so?
Celine, last night, we discussed a certain proposal.
And I said no, because you cheat, Elliot.
OK.
So I'm flirtatious.
It's in my nature.
But I want you to think again.
Do you know how difficult it is for a woman to find... a good husband in this town?
Let alone a good dentist.
Celine...
I'm serious.
Robots?
You're telling us we're gonna be replaced by robots?
That robots will get down on their robot hands and knees... and clean the dust out of every office in this building?
I think not, Ms. Gesteten.
At least the robot won't spend its time writing a trash novel.
Not even a very good trash novel, as I understand it.
Oh, I see. This is personal.
This has nothing to do with me,
Robert.
This comes right from the top... from Mr. Naville himself.
Perhaps it's time
I spoke to this Mr. Naville guy.
It's too late.
You're fired.
You ready?
Mm-hmm.
Now, if you move... the offer's canceled.
OK.
Mm-hmm.
- Wait, Celine...
- Don't speak.
Do you think this is wise?
Puts me off.
Ha.
Ha.
Stop!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Mayhew...
Would you call a doctor?
It would be a pleasure, madam.
What are you doing here this time of day?
Hi, Lily.
Well? Answer me.
Lily, I... I got fired.
They replaced me with a robot.
I know how they feel.
Hmm?
Look, I've been meaning to tell you this... for a while now, and... seems like a good a time as any.
Robert...
I'm leaving you.
You're leaving?
What are you talking about?
His name is Ryan.
He teaches aerobics.
We're in love.
We're moving to Miami.
How can you do this?
At a time like this!
I want a man, not a dreamer.
I don't know what to say.
We could talk about this.
I'll get another job.
We'll sort everything out.
Sorry... but as of tonight... you're going home alone.
Uh...
Lily!
I'm leaving you.
You're fired.
It's kind of obvious, Robert.
He teaches aerobics.
We're in love.
We're moving to Miami.
Oh.
Lily?
Lily?
Mr. Robert Lewis?
Yeah, that's me.
My name is Jackson.
This is my associate
Ms. O'Reilly.
We're from the Firm But Fair
Eviction & Collection Agency.
I have a list of certain items we're empowered to collect... under federal and state law... in lieu of unpaid debts.
Furthermore, we are contracted to serve upon you... notice of eviction from these here premises, uh, forthwith.
I beg your pardon?
We can do this with violence or without.
It's up to you.
The client pays our medical bills, but not yours.
Well?
Oh, without, please.
Good choice.
OK, let's go.
All right.
Cannot believe this.
Do you have any idea... how difficult it is to find a good husband in this town?
Hmm?!
Or a good dentist, come to that?
Playing this sort of game... you have disgraced yourself once again.
You caught him through the frontal lobe... so apparently he'll live.
But he'll never practice orthodontics again... that's for sure.
Mr. Schneider, call extension 487.
Mr. Schneider,487.
My main fear is you're going to end up like your mother... who long ago found her own natural level in society.
That is to say she scuttles along the bottom.
Her biggest problem was marrying a man like you... a mistake I have taken great care to avoid.
You... are gonna go to work, my girl.
What?
You have spent a quarter of a century... watching the tide go in and out... but from tomorrow, you are going to work... here, under my supervision.
You're gonna learn the essence of business... about money and how it flows relentlessly back... towards he who owns it.
How to generate a profit from a loss... a loss from a profit.
You are gonna work.
This may not strike you as very palatable.
Seven...
It may make you want to vomit.
But you will get used to the taste.
And pretty soon, you'll be spooning it down... and asking for more like all the other kids.
Eleven...
Mr. Naville, I presume?
Eleven...
You think you can replace me with a robot?
Eleven...
Well, get this!
Eleven...
Aah!
Twelve... thirteen...
Fuck.
Fourteen...
Ohh!
Nobody fucking move!
Nobody fucking move!
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Everyone on the floor!
Everyone!
Everyone!
Four, five... six... seven...
Now, I want my job back!
I want what I had before,
Mr. Naville!
I'm gonna count to five.
If you don't oblige me,
I'm gonna kill you.
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Ow!
- Ow!
- Ow!
- What did you say that for?
- Five comes directly after four.
I know that!
I thought you had a problem.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Without access to a proper education...
- Shut up!
- I was just trying to help.
I don't need any help.
You'll die for this,
I swear to God.
- I'm sorry. No.
- You could shoot him again.
In the head this time.
I'll count to five.
Shut up!
Who are you, anyway?
Nobody!
I'm his daughter.
Aah!
This kid's got a gun.
Hey, cool it.
Take it easy, pal.
Chill out.
Drive!
Will you just drive?!
I can't.
- What?
- I don't know how.
- You don't know how to drive?
- I never learned.
- Why not?!
- I didn't need to!
Well, you do now!
This one makes it go faster, that one slower.
This is forwards, that's backwards.
The rest you can pick up as we go along.
Drive!
Where are we going?
Never mind that.
Just drive more carefully.
He cut in on me.
Mirror, signal, maneuver.
You say nothing, OK?
Afternoon, ma'am.
Afternoon, sir.
My name's Walt.
I'm here to help you any way
I can during your visit... be it short or long... and whether it is purely for refueling purposes... or for the use of our extensive washroom and retail facilities.
- Is this a gas station, Walt?
- It sure is, sir.
Then fill it up with gas and cut the crap.
The guy was just doing his job.
You know, he was just trying to be helpful.
You're in a lot of trouble, you know?
My father's gonna have you killed.
Do you realize that?
Tortured first, naturally.
Then he's gonna have you killed.
And what if I let you go?
I don't know. What do you think?
Think he's just gonna forgive you?
Wait a minute.
Why would I ask him to forgive me?
Your father treated me like a piece of shit... like I was nobody... just because I was a cleaner... like I was disposable.
Ahem.
Well, that's the tank full, sir.
Thank you, Walt.
That's for you, Walt.
You're a man, Walt.
Not a slave, not a machine.
Don't let anyone ever treat you otherwise.
Go on.
It's empty.
Let's get this clear.
I'm not gonna hurt you... but I am the kidnapper, and you are the...
Victim.
That's just the way it is.
It's OK.
I've been through this before.
Kidnapped before?
Yeah. I was twelve.
- God, that's terrible.
- It was a long time ago.
So... so how am I doing?
In the kidnap?
Yeah.
So far, you're not doing too bad.
Thank you.
Anyway, I'm just tying you up so you can't escape in the night.
I know that.
Because, of course, you would.
Are you gonna try to have sex with me?
No.
Isn't that what you brought me up here for?
No, it's not.
It didn't even cross your mind?
No. Well... No.
Do you have a problem with sex?
No.
So you're just frightened of it?
No.
- Nervous, then?
- I'm not nervous.
- Then calm down.
- I'm perfectly calm.
I'm just trying to explain... that there's no sexual motives for my actions.
I'm glad we got that cleared up.
So, what did they do next?
They put a needle in my arm and took a pint of blood... and sent it to my father.
The next week they did the same... and the same the next week till he paid up.
He waited six weeks.
That's what happens to the victim.
Around our way
The sun shines bright
Around our way
The birds sing for ya
'Cause they already know ya
Enjoying the book?
No.
What's it about?
It's a romance.
This girl meets this guy.
They fall in love.
It's bullshit.
I'm writing a novel myself.
A lot of people say that, but in my case, it's true.
I'm not interested... in you or your novel... or any other pathetic ambition you have... to change your miserable, mundane existence.
Do you want some exercise?
No.
You can't say no. It's not part of the arrangement.
- I want to read my book.
- You said it was bullshit.
Doesn't mean
I'm not enjoying it.
- You just said you weren't!
- A girl can change her mind.
" She heard his breathing become shallow...
"and a flicker of a smile chased across her lips...
"as she meditated on the power she now held over him.
"'Are you sure you want to catch that flight? '
"she asked."
Do you think they're in love yet?
No.
If they are in love, we can go home.
Tonight, you're mine
I hate it down here.
I hate the air and I hate the food... and I hate the plumbing.
" She pulled him closer, unable to stop."
I ache... all over.
"This, indeed, was perfect love."
I sweat in the heat and ache in the cold.
But will you love me tomorrow?
Why can't we stay someplace decent?
Budget doesn't cover that.
Exactly. Why not?
You know those mysterious ways you keep hearing about, Jackson?
Well, this is one of them.
"...cold, gloating gaze, she let her hand droop down...
"towards the bulge of his passion."
I remember the good old days.
" She heard his breathing become shallow."
All you had to do was introduce a man and a woman.
Nature did the rest.
"She gasped..."
Aah! Fuck!
"with surprise and delight."
Doesn't work like that anymore.
" All of her soul erupted between her thighs...
"as she sensed the firm, exploratory pressure...
"of his warm flesh."
Men and women... it's all gone to shit.
Sure has.
"In the hidden recess of her pelvis...
"their bodies fused into one writhing mass... of torrid, torrid sexual..."
When the night
Meets the morning sun
I'd like to know
That your love
Is a love I can
Be sure of
So tell me now
Mmm.
And I won't ask again
Mmm.
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Mmm.
Aren't you hungry?
I don't eat red meat.
Well, you could eat the vegetables.
They're on the same plate.
So?
I'm not gonna eat this.
Do you eat fish and poultry?
Yes.
But not red meat?
No. Or eggs, unless I know they're free-range.
Then why didn't you tell me you don't like meat?
Because you didn't ask!
And I do like meat.
I just don't eat it.
Moral reasons, if you must know.
If you had taken the time to inquire...
Why are you such a pain to be with?
Because you tied me to a chair all night!
Because I am the victim... and you are the kidnapper, apparently!
Meaning exactly what?
"Kidnap For Beginners"... chapter one... have you even asked for a ransom yet?
Don't say a word until I tell you.
Hello. Mr. Naville? lt... it's me.
Now, I want my...
Me.
The kidnapper!
Right. Now, what I want...
It's not like that.
That's unfair now. I would not...
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?
I'm negotiating with your father.
- Did you get very far?
- Well, he kept interrupting.
- Right.
- Wouldn't let me finish.
Remember what they didn't teach you... at Harvard Business School, OK?
I didn't go to Harvard Business School.
It's a figure of speech, Robert.
Oh.
Sorry.
Negotiation is a weakness.
You are the kidnapper.
You demand, and he complies.
You go in hard, and you go in fast.
- Hard and fast.
- Right.
I'm you.
You grasp that?
OK.
Pretend it's ringing.
You psych yourself up.
Go to your dark side.
OK. He answers.
All right, you motherfucker,
I've got your daughter here.
I'm sending her back in pieces if I don't get what I want.
I'm gonna pull her fingers out with pliers... and then I'm gonna fry them up for breakfast, understand?
And so on and so on like that, OK?
For no longer than thirty seconds.
What?
Hello there. Mr. Naville?
Now...
Right, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here... and I'm gonna cut her up... and post her home to you in boxes! Small boxes!
Right, daughter,
I've got your asshole here... and I'm gonna send...
Right! Right!
No, I can't speak to anyone!
I need to speak to him!
Hello?
Yeah, I can hold.
Right, listen, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here... and I'm gonna send her back in pieces unless...
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.
No, I must've dialed the wrong number.
No, I haven't got your daughter here.
I have someone else's.
No, we're not married.
Yes, I've read the same thing.
It's very hard to find suitable young men these days.
Well, I'm sure your daughter's very nice.
In principle, I've got no objections to meeting her...
What is the problem?
I think you should just send a letter.
Done this kind of work before?
We do everything.
Eviction and debt collection are our daily bread... but personal retrieval, bounty hunting... you name it, we do it.
How much?
Our fee for the recovery of your daughter is... one hundred thousand dollars.
That's a lot of money.
Five thousand advance.
The rest is cash on delivery.
No daughter, no dough.
Naturally, we operate a sliding scale... whereby if we only bring back part of your daughter... we only get part of the money.
That's enough, Jackson.
If he's cut her ears off, and we can't find them... we'll knock a couple thousand off the tariff.
More for a limb, obviously.
Jackson.
Sorry.
Mr. Naville,
I don't think you need to worry.
My partner is simply envisaging a worst-case scenario.
What about the kidnapper?
You want him, too?
That's extra.
What if he gets in the way?
We'll deal with that situation if it arises.
What if I want him to get in the way?
Let us speak plainly,
Mr. Naville.
You want we should kill him?
Yes.
Uh...
Sir, I must say...
No one's asking you, Mayhew.
Very good, sir.
I am not gonna kill anyone.
If we don't get this job, someone else will.
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- Including expenses?
Including all expenses... except medical costs... for which you accept full and unlimited responsibility.
Only for the duration of the contract.
- Naturally.
- It's a deal.
Good afternoon.
Hi.
I'm Tod Johnson.
I live up the hill.
That's nice.
I see most things from up there.
Saw you arrive.
Big car, middle of the night.
Right.
Wondered "Who's that?"
Perfectly natural question.
So I asked Felix.
Felix?
Felix is my friend.
He hasn't been the same since the war.
Of course.
I asked him.
I said, " Felix, tell me...
"are they good, or are they evil?"
One bark for good, two for evil.
Felix is a dog?
Do you think that I would talk to a dog?
Do you think
I would ask a dog... whether or not you're good or evil?
What do you think I am... some kind of a crazy backwoods lunatic... with a barn full of human skulls... and a scythe that I sharpen every day... in readiness for Armageddon?
No.
I'm sure you're a regular guy.
Right! I'm regular!
I am a regular man.
I want...
That's not the point!
The point is, who are you?!
Who are you?!
Well, I'm...
We're newlyweds.
Are you coming back to bed soon, darling?
This is Mr. Johnson, dear.
Hello.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You can call me Lucille.
My pleasure, Lucille.
You're not from the newspapers, are you?
I live up the hill.
Oh, good. You can't tell the newspapers we're here.
They never leave us alone, on account of Ritchie.
Ritchie?
You recognize Ritchie, don't you?
Ritchie Vanderlow?
Six gold albums... three platinum.
Fourteen consecutive top-ten singles.
Largest-selling artist worldwide... for the last twelve months?
Ritchie Vanderlow!
You have got to understand, ma'am...
I watch mainly the biblical channels.
It's OK.
We were married in secret... in a castle in Scotland.
That's in England.
Near Paris?
Paris.
Right.
It was so romantic.
We stayed there for our honeymoon... but it wasn't long enough... so we came here for the sake of a little privacy.
Mmm. I see.
Would you like to come in...
Mr. Johnson?
No, I better be on my way.
I have to feed Felix.
OK.
Well... it was a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Johnson.
See you around.
I'll catch you later then,
Mr. Johnson.
Take care, Ritchie.
Thanks.
This?
The ransom note.
- Right. Anonymous.
- Yeah.
Robert... my father knows who you are.
Oh, I never thought of that.
You are the worst kidnapper
I've ever met.
Oh, and that's all I am to you, isn't it?
The latest kidnapper!
A lifestyle accessory.
And if it doesn't work, it doesn't matter...
'cause you can always get another one.
Quit being so melodramatic.
I'm trying to do my best here... under really difficult circumstances!
It's not made any easier... by you criticizing everything I do!
- How much you asking for?
- Half a million.
- Dollars?
- Yes.
- U.S. Dollars?
- Is there a problem?
Half a million dollars isn't a lot of money for me!
It's not meant to reflect you as an individual.
If word got out I was liberated for half a million...
I could never show my face in polite society again.
Diamonds have no value except that which is placed upon them.
It's more complicated than I thought!
OK, don't worry... all right?
You're trying hard.
You're keen to learn.
That's important.
Let's just not lose sight of the fact... that we have the opportunity... to make millions of dollars here.
We?
Yes, Robert.
You and me.
Is that not a little irregular?
Yes, it is.
Millions?
Please, dad, just give him the money!
He's gonna kill me, daddy!
Please! Just put it in the trunk of the car... two miles south of Palmer, please, daddy!
Daddy!
OK, OK, OK.
OK, OK.
Nice shooting.
Thanks.
Shit.
Aah!
No problem.
Exactly as you predicted.
"Quick, drive my car."
Here's forty dollars.
If you don't mind me asking... how did you know he'd react like that?
It's our job to know things like that.
You done this sort of thing before?
Let's go!
You can take the car, but remember, it's stolen.
Look, they weren't trying to kill you.
They were trying to confuse you and scare you.
Yeah, before they killed me.
And I lost the car, and I didn't get any money.
You can't expect to get everything right the first time.
Look, you are going to be fine.
You are going to be... a success.
Do you think so?
You didn't get caught, right?
No.
No, I didn't get caught.
I fooled them.
I got away.
Maybe we should go out.
Out where?
For a drink.
What, like on a date?
Yeah, like a date.
I wouldn't call it a bad relationship.
No, Lily and I, we just...
You know, we just grew apart as people.
There was no bitterness on either side.
She left you?
No, no, no, no. No!
Yes, she left me.
Mmm.
The aerobics instructor.
How did you know?
You have the demeanor... of a man who's been left for an aerobics instructor.
- I do?
- Yeah.
But be honest.
It was inevitable.
You two weren't suited for one another.
You dream of something better.
She wants it now.
Hence, the gymnast.
Am I right?
Well, yeah.
Yeah. It's a common scenario.
Can I tell you about this dream I have? You're in it.
I'm in your dream?
Now I feel violated.
- Oh, it's not like that.
- I don't wanna hear it.
Perhaps this is a good opportunity... to tell you about my novel.
Look, I'm not interested in your novel.
It's 1962, right?
And Marilyn Monroe... is giving birth to a baby girl.
She's on the phone to Jack Kennedy... saying, " Jack, it's yours.
It's yours, Jack."
So the orphan grows up...
And she solves some great mystery, right?
It's kind of obvious, Robert.
Let's play a game.
If I win...
I go free.
Look, you are free.
The kidnap's over.
You're more a kidnapper than I am Ritchie Vanderlow.
Indulge me, Robert.
Well, if it's what you want.
It's all I ever want.
OK.
You're free.
That's right.
Aren't you gonna leave?
We haven't got our money yet.
Don't take your love to town
Oh, Ruby
For God's sakes, turn around
Big hand! Big hand!
Big hand for local boy
Scottie Sherman.
We are privileged to have here tonight... a very special guest... who is a close personal friend of mine... and I'm gonna ask him to come up here and sing a song.
He is the best-selling artist in the world... with twelve gold albums... sixteen platinum albums... and thirty-two number-one hit singles!
Mr. Ritchie Vanderclaw!
Thank you very much.
My name is Rob...
Ritchie Vanderlow... and, um...
I'd like to sing this song for my beautiful wife...
Aww.
Lucille.
Uh...
Oh, and this is a very special song for us.
Somewhere
Beyond the sea
Somewhere
Waiting for me
My lover stands
On golden sands
And watches the ships
That go sailing
Somewhere
Beyond the sea
She's there
Watching for me
And if I could fly
Like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing
It's far
Beyond the stars
It's near
Beyond the moon
I know
Beyond a doubt
My heart
Will lead me there
Soon
We'll meet
Beyond the shore
We'll kiss
Just like before
And happy we'll be
Beyond the sea
And never again
I'll go sailing
I know
I know
Beyond a doubt
My heart
Will lead me there
Soon
We'll meet
Touches my heart to see two young people in love.
Happy we'll be
Beyond the sea
And never again
I'll go sailing
Hmm.
Oh, my God. What happened?
You were great.
I was?
Mm-hmm.
I remember drinking tequila.
Certainly was a feature of the evening.
Then I had an incredible dream.
This dream, I've had it before.
You're definitely in it now.
I don't want to hear it.
We were on this game show called Perfect Love.
Never heard of it.
Well, it's just a dream.
I don't think the fact that it's a game show... has any relevance.
It merely indicates my cultural origins.
I mean, were I a tribesman in the Kalahari, for instance... the location would undoubtedly have been different.
But I think the theme is universal.
We're on this game show called Perfect Love.
My life was in danger.
Are you ready?
Am I ready for what?
To write a letter.
Perhaps you'd like to keep this.
We had it analyzed.
It's his handwriting and her blood.
Without our help,
Mr. Naville... that could be the last trace of your daughter you ever see.
He wants a straight switch with no delays.
- I want her back.
- Don't worry. We'll get her.
And I want him dead.
That's understood, Mr. Naville.
Good.
And when this is over,
I want this back.
Bradley was nice, you know?
Extremely wealthy.
Honorable, amusing.
And?
Well, eighty-seven years old.
- Ha ha. Pity.
- Yeah.
Then there was Jake.
He was nice.
Very rich.
Just so conventional.
You see?
Rich guys. Conventional.
It's a problem.
Then there was Angelo.
Twenty-five years old... handsome, healthy... exciting... sophisticated.
Considerate.
So?
Well, I think that we just sort of, um... grew apart as people.
The aerobics instructor?
Like I said... it's a common scenario.
So who was next?
Then I started getting problems with my teeth.
With your teeth?
Yeah, my teeth.
Hey, want a ride?
Hi, thanks for stopping, guys.
Uh, we're not stealing it, we're just borrowing it.
Had that dream again last night.
What dream?
We were on that game show Perfect Love.
- Mmm. Fascinating.
- And my life was in danger.
On a game show?
I know.
It's difficult to explain.
Strange things were happening.
Mmm. So it would appear.
But my life was in danger... and you saved it.
My heart was beating so fast... and then it stopped.
And I was just about to die... and you saved it.
You saved my life.
Well, what are we waiting for?
You want to get on with this or not?
Sure!
You send the girl over.
Ha ha. First the money.
That was the deal.
Are you OK, Miss Naville?
Yes, I'm OK.
I'm just a little frightened.
Now, don't you worry, miss.
Everything'll be all right.
Well?
Whew. It's here.
OK? Send the girl over.
OK, go on.
Ohh, damn.
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Help!
Get down! Get down!
Yes.
They tied me up! Ohh!
Ha ha!
Don't move a fucking muscle.
Mmm.
What took you?
He shot up the car!
You shot up our car.
Now, what did you do that for?
I was trying to make a getaway.
You were trying to make a getaway?
How is she?
I don't know.
But I don't think it's worked.
They're not... you know?
Jeopardy.
Jeopardy, Jackson... always works.
OK.
This is far enough.
Are you... are you going to kill me?
Yeah.
Well, then I don't see why I should dig.
If you dig...
I promise you when the time comes...
I'll shoot you through the head.
Now, look, you don't like that?
I can just shoot you through the testicles right now.
You can bleed to death.
I'll dig the grave.
It's up to you.
Can you cut me free?
Please?
It's sore.
What's he going to do with him?
Shoot him in the back of the head.
Right.
Would that be a problem for you?
Ever felt like you're not in control of events?
Yes.
No, I mean... something is... destined to happen... and it doesn't?
Like, what happens when the forces of destiny... are no longer in control?
I don't know.
The truth is...
I don't think even he knows what's going on down here... the chaos, the...
This hatred, this violence.
Who...
Who are you talking about?
Jeopardy, Jackson... always works.
Dig.
What are they doing in there?
Should've shot him myself.
Yeah, well, you can't trust them to do anything.
I take it you're not in a love situation.
What?
I mean you're not in love.
What's it to you?
Nothing.
Just asking.
I like it like that
And I know it
That's OK. You can stop now.
No.
I've waited long enough.
No.
Give me that. Lie down.
No, no. No!
Give it to me! Give it to me!
Please!
- Please.
- Shh.
Aah!
Leave it all behind
I commit you to his mercy.
Please. Please. Please.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No! No!
Get up!
Robert, get off!
Who are they?
Come on!
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
Aah!
Ohh.
Just for a minute there,
I thought we were in trouble.
I told you don't get caught.
Don't get out of the car.
Don't ever go into the woods with a stranger.
- I know. You're right.
- I'm always right, OK?
You might like to remember that.
Have you got the money?
- Aah!
- Aah!
No! Jesus!
I'm going to get you.
Aah!
Ohh!
Shit.
- Oh, shit.
- Where is she?
Oh, shit.
Drive!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Jesus!
- Jump!
- What?
Jump!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
If the card's no good,
I'm authorized to destroy it.
It's my card, lady.
Listen, you don't understand.
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry about this, ma'am.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I've got some cash, OK?
Thirty dollars, sir.
Thank you.
How could he do a thing like that?
Stay calm, OK?
My own father.
He canceled my credit card.
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.
- I know exactly how you feel.
- You couldn't possibly know.
Only the exceptionally rich can know how I feel right now.
Don't take it personally.
Is he trying to say
I'll find my own natural level?
Sink to the bottom like her?
Like who?
Who are you talking about?
Pull over.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Live a little.
This is insane.
Stop worrying so much.
It'll be my first time, too.
That's what I'm worrying about.
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
Next.
Hello.
I'd like to make a withdrawal.
I thought we agreed... no clichÃ©s.
Fill the bag.
Oh, my God, she's got a gun!
Leave my daughter alone.
Please, leave her alone!
- Don't be silly.
- She's going to kill her!
She's not going to kill your daughter.
- Yes, I am.
- What?
Shut up.
Christ, no!
Everybody calm down..., or this girl's brains will splatter the wall.
- Fill the bag!
- Celine!
You shut up especially.
You can't hold the girl hostage.
What?
Oh, no!
You didn't find it difficult.
- That was different.
- Was it?
Didn't feel different.
It felt just like this.
Now do you understand how it felt, Robert?
But you, unlike me, couldn't pull the trigger.
- Oh, no.
- Good-bye, Robert.
OK, kill me, but don't touch the girl!
Extremely amusing!
" Kill me, but don't touch the girl."
Robert, you should be on television.
- Very funny.
- What's wrong?
What's wrong? I thought you were going to shoot me!
That's what's wrong!
Shoot you? I wouldn't do that.
- Oh, no?
- No! I'm having a great time!
- Oh, good!
- Yeah, certainly is!
What's wrong?
Celine, it's over.
Aah!
I'm dying, Celine.
I think I'm dying, and I don't want to die.
You're not going to die.
I don't want to die.
Are you taking me to a hospital?
Because I don't want to die in a hospital.
I'm not going to take you to a hospital.
What do you mean, you're not taking me to a hospital?
Take me to a hospital!
Where are you taking me?
Very nice.
Very nice, indeed.
You could have a perfect smile.
For two thousand dollars, you could change your life.
No, thanks.
Do you think a perfect smile just happens?
Is that what you think? Huh?
Do you think that Celine's smile is her own?
No, it's not.
It's mine.
I gave it to her... just like I can give you one.
I'll fix your teeth for twelve thousand dollars.
I didn't get shot in the teeth.
Well, let me tell you something.
It wouldn't have made too much difference if you had.
I don't want to say anything.
It's your teeth, but if you wait another year... you'll have fifty grand worth of major reconstruction, so...
If you wait another year... he'll be dead.
Sorry. Just a little free consultation.
You know, they wanted me to take a break.
Take a break.
Go get counseling, you know?
Fuck them. What do they know?
They wanted me to stay in the hospital.
I discharged myself this afternoon.
Lucky for you that I did, huh?
OK.
Have you, um, done this before?
The principles of surgery... are the same above and below the neck.
Aah! Aah!
Aren't you going to anesthetize me?
I'm sure you'll pass out as the pain gets worse.
Aah!
Aah!
Give me another one.
Here we go, baby.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yaah!
Give it to me hot.
You look lovely.
Thank you.
Give me the Bambi, baby.
That's it.
God!
OK, turn over. Turn over.
- What?
- Turn over, darling.
Turn...
There you go.
Flash me the tush.
One heel.
Excellent.
Mmm.
Robbie!
Hey, how are you? Come on.
Join the party.
Come on.
Do you want some champagne?
How rude of me. Excuse me, love.
Oh, wait.
Here you go.
Here. Look at that.
So, I understand that you're...
Here, please.
I understand that you're something of a fugitive.
Don't be shocked.
We go back a long way.
Oh, I see. You're her dentist.
Yup. That's right.
We met over that particularly fine set of ivories.
In fact...
I gave her her first filling.
Ohh!
Fuck.
Oh, I wish you hadn't done that.
Now I have to hurt you... which is inconvenient and undignified.
Ohh!
Fucker.
Get up!
Leave him alone, Elliot.
Why don't you stay out of this?
Are you all right?
Uhh!
Gaah!
Uhh! Aah!
You want to explain to me... exactly what you were trying to achieve back there?
How about you do some explaining to me?
I didn't want you bleeding to death... and I think I saved your life.
I'd rather have died than have witnessed that.
Witnessed what, exactly?
You and Elliot in an advanced state of foreplay.
He would've passed out drunk in five minutes... if you hadn't come along.
Yeah, sure.
Even if we were about to get physical... what's it got to do with you anyway?
Aah.
You thought we had something?
It's possible.
But why?
Why do we have to have something?
We were getting along just fine.
Having something ruins everything.
What will you do now, ask me to marry you?
Of course I'm not.
- You thought about it.
- Don't be absurd.
It never even occurred to you?
Well, it wouldn't be so bad.
You see what I mean?
Just forget it.
Consider it forgotten.
Where do you want to go?
Don't care.
Do you want to get out of the car?
- Are you asking me to get out?
- No. I'm asking if you want to.
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.
One is a request, the other is a question.
Fine. If that's what you want, then I'll get out.
If that's what you want, go right ahead.
And don't even ask where I'm going!
Don't even imagine that I care.
Exactly the problem!
Where's the love gone to?
Don't leave
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me hurtin'
Don't leave
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You know it's never been easy
To love someone like me
Oh, oh
Don't leave
Yeah, yeah
Fuck.
Where did all the love go?
Where's the love gone to?
Stop hovering over me.
I can't concentrate.
Have you written anything yet?
I... I...
What am I supposed to write?
Love letters, Jackson, deal with the subject of love.
I need time to think.
We don't have time.
Every day they spend apart... the more difficult it's going to be.
And if Naville finds our boy... he's just meat.
Maybe I didn't treat you...
So, think, Jackson... have you ever done this before?
Back when I was alive, there was a girl.
You wrote to some girl?
A long time ago.
You never told me about this.
It never came to nothing.
Her father did not approve our match.
It was just young love, but I wrote... many times... with passion... and despair.
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
I never knew you had a romantic soul.
All those lonely, lonely nights
I often wonder what became of that girl... sweet Eliza.
Eliza...
Gray.
Her father was a colonel.
Jackson, you're qualified.
You can write this letter.
That's the problem, see?
I wrote to her, sure, but I didn't write letters.
Well, what, then?
As a matter of fact...
I... wrote... love poems.
Tell me that your sweet love
Tell me that your sweet love
Hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Remember, my dear... they only want one thing.
Maybe they want it more than once... but it's still only one thing.
Little things
I should have said
And done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
I wish you had let me read that poem.
A poem... is a very personal document.
I hope it was a good one.
That's all I'm saying.
Because if she don't like it, she won't come.
And if she don't come, we're stuck.
It's her.
- I got your poem.
- Sorry?
Your poem... the one you wrote me.
Poem?
"Oh, desert me, wretched loneliness...
"and bring me back my love...
"for she and I have parted...
"and the sky is up above."
It worked.
She loves it.
" Your limbs so svelte and slender..."
"Your touch...
"so soft and tender."
"But the bits that I like best...
"are the bits that..."
I'm not going to read that line.
Jackson, Jackson, what the hell did you write?
It was a...
Yeah?
A simple poetic reference... uh, to...
Celine.
Please.
Last verse.
"Just as the flowers blossom...
"in the gaze of the shining sun..."
"I would be most honored..."
"if you would bear my son."
Robert, no one has ever written me a poem before.
All those guys I dated, they didn't care about me.
They just wanted to own this.
Huh?
I would never open my heart to any of those guys.
And before I met you...
I never believed that there was any alternative.
Oh!
I knew it!
But when you stopped that bullet...
Ha ha ha ha! and got the wrong idea about Elliot...
I knew it!
I should've understood.
- Celine...
- No. Let me finish.
This is difficult for me to say... but I feel I can trust you.
I didn't write the poem.
What?
I didn't write it.
I've never written a poem in my life.
How can anybody be that honest?
It's his handwriting.
Tell him it's his handwriting.
But it's your handwriting.
It... it has this address.
It even has some sort of cheap aftershave on the paper.
I didn't write the poem, OK?
Oh, my God.
Celine, no need to...
Human fucking beings.
What do you have to do?
We did everything for them!
Brought them together.
Put them in jeopardy.
We damn near killed them both!
We gave them every opportunity.
All they had to do was fall in love... and we could've gone home.
Maybe we failed, Jackson... but we don't have to live like this.
Is she gone?
Yeah.
Nice-looking woman.
She isn't my type.
What are you talking about?
Look at yourself.
You're nobody.
You're nothing.
You're wanted in connection with a violent crime.
You're cleaning the floor of a diner.
She is an intelligent, passionate... beautiful rich woman.
The issue of whether or not she's your type... is not one that you are likely... to have to resolve in this world.
She's there watching for me
Or indeed the next, since she will be going to some heaven... for glamorous pussy... and you will be cleaning the floor of a diner... in hell.
I guess so.
So why are you even thinking about it?
I don't know.
Stupid...
Come on.
Finish the floor.
What the fuck?
Aah!
Shut up!
Where's my beautiful poem?
Your father's not home yet.
I don't expect he'll pay our ransom straight off.
Not till we send a few fingers through the mail.
Ooh.
Sixteen.
I'm gonna stick right there.
Say, how about you?
You want a hit?
No.
Mmm, stay.
- Uh-huh?
- No.
- Hit?
- No!
Now, Miss Naville... you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville. you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.
You can stick right there... and you got four thousand dollars.
Mm-hmm.
But you want another hit? OK.
No, no!
- What is that?
- Answer it, Jackson.
I can't do that.
I'm playing blackjack.
She might cheat while I'm out of the room.
All right.
I'll answer the door.
You play blackjack with the hostage.
You sure you want to increase your bet... before you take another hit?
No!
No!
OK.
No!
And...
No!
Aah!
Well...
There.
It's just as well we're not playing for real.
Come on!
All right, now cut her free.
Aah!
What the hell did you do to her?
I punched her in the face.
Oh! Ow!
Oh, you punched her in the face.
She's half your size, and you punch her?
- She had a gun!
- Oh, she had a gun?
So that makes everything all right, does it?
I'm not saying it makes everything all right.
I'm just trying to explain that for all I knew... she could have been a karate expert or something.
With a broken arm?
With a broken arm?!
OK. I'm sorry.
Now just cut her free!
You son of a bitch!
- Celine?
- What do you want?
I'm just trying to explain.
Aah!
Despite your crummy poem...
I came to visit and all you could do... was humiliate me and turn me away.
I thought you were decent.
I thought you were different, but you're not.
You're just a lying, cheating son of a bitch... just like all the rest!
Celine,
I never meant to hurt you!
I don't know who wrote that poem... but I'll tell you, those are my feelings.
Oh, sure.
Not so easy now, huh?
Celine, Celine!
When you left the diner last night...
I realized
I'd turned away the woman... whom I'd spent the happiest... most exciting times of my life with... who I care for more than anyone on the earth!
Listen, listen!
Do you remember that dream I had?
I dreamed that my life was in danger... that my heart stopped.
But you saved my life... when you pierced my heart with an arrow of your love.
And that's the truth.
Celine, what I'm saying is that I love you.
What? What did you say?
What I was trying to say was that I...
Oh, shit.
What?
Who is that?
Don't worry, Miss Celine.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Aah!
Well, we're not just gonna leave them here, are we?
No, sir.
Come in.
Yes, there is a
Deeper river
That will bring you
Home again
Oh, there is a
Deeper river
Flowing under
I don't think they're coming back.
Isn't there anything you can do?
I don't have the authority to intervene.
Deeper river
I don't have the authority to intervene!
That will bring you
Home again
Let me out of this trunk now!
Robert, he's gonna kill you!
Just run.
He doesn't want the money, OK?
He's gonna kill you!
Just run, Robert, run!
It's probably in the canoe, Mr. Naville.
That's probably where it is.
It's not in the canoe, sir... but I think it's, uh, upstairs.
I think it's upstairs.
Might've put it there.
They probably left it under the bed.
That would be a good place.
Tsk tsk tsk.
I don't think he has it...
Mr. Naville.
No. I... that's it!
That's where it is!
That's where it was.
I put it under that board.
I'll have your money back to you in a minute, Mr. Naville, sir.
Board up, and then we'll get it back to you.
We're just gonna have to face the truth, Robert.
You don't have my money.
Yeah, it's down here, all right, Mr. Naville, sir.
Just where I left it.
And frankly, I don't care.
It's just a detail.
You'll have your money back in a second, sir.
Long as you understand that it isn't the money.
It's the principle.
Somebody please just let me out of here!
Mayhew, not with the ax.
This is Gabriel.
Get me God.
Let's go. Come on!
Come on, come on!
Robert, what happened was you shot them, and then you...
Did he just move?
No, sir.
In all respect, sir, how could anything be beyond your control?
Anyway, you shot them... then you shot...
You sure he didn't move?
I'm quite sure, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Sir?
Please.
Yeah, quite.
Yeah, right.
Mayhew, she's moved.
She's moved.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
They are both dead, sir.
I shot them myself.
I won't disturb you again.
Yahoo!
Who's that?
Robert?
You shot them... and then you shot yourself, and then... you set fire to this cabin.
Didn't you?
Not yet, he didn't.
Celine.
Why...
Why don't you just put that gun down, hmm?
Do not get in my way, father.
Celine... you're not responsible for your actions.
You're unhinged.
You need the best psychiatric treatment... that money can buy... just like your mother.
So why don't you just...
Why don't you just give me the gun?
Because as he dreamt...
I shall save his life with an arrow... an arrow of my love for him.
Kill him, Mayhew.
Ezekiel!
He's alive, Mayhew.
They're all alive.
If I were your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength
To walk out that door
My love would overrule my sense
And I'd call you back for more
If I were your woman
So you're telling me that successful relationships... are made in heaven?
Not founded on the daily practicality... of two people being prepared... to tolerate the imperfections of one another?
It's not successful relationships, Celine.
It's love. And it comes from a strange and wonderful place... that we don't know about.
So you also reject the idea... that love is merely an emotional adaptation... to a physical necessity?
Completely.
Are you serious?
Fate intervenes in people's lives.
In ours, for instance.
Fate brought us together.
It kept us together.
We were destined for one another.
Fate had a pretty strange way of making its point.
But that's part of the beauty of it.
It's inexplicable, unpredictable... and absolutely beyond control or understanding.
But you nearly got killed.
But I didn't... and here we are.
Do you have any substantial evidence to back all this?
None at all.
And you realize that it's absurd and irrational?
I know that.
Then why do you believe it?
Because, Celine, I'm a dreamer.
Well, I guess that makes two of us.
Are you ready?
As I'll ever be.
Then let's go.
But I'm too afraid to show it
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
Never, no, no, no
Stop loving you
Oh, yeah
If I were your woman
Do you know what I'd do?
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
If I were your woman
Your sweet loving woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
I'd be your only woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
You'd need no other woman
You'd need no other woman
All clear.
So, how was it?
Believe me, Gabriel.
You don't want to know.
- But it worked.
- Yeah.
Love... worked.
Ameratus pathum laborium.
Are we going home now?
We're going home.
At last.
Ohh!
The paper boy is looking before he goes
Lying to the teacher who knows he knows
He didn't, and he should've brought his lines in yesterday
Ernie bangs the sound as the day begins
The letterbox is open, and your cash falls in
Aah!
I'll meet you at the office just before the staff clock in
Round our way
The birds are singing
Round our way
The sun shines bright
Aah!
Round our way
The birds sing for you
'Cause they already know you
Yeah, they already know you
The game is kicking off in around the park
It's twenty-five a side, and before it's dark
There's gonna be a loser
And you know the next goal wins
Cab it to the front
As it's called a draw
Everybody's knocking at yours once more
Ernie bangs the sound
And no one's spoken since half past four
La la la la la la la
Round our way the birds are singing
Round our way the sun shines bright
Round our way the birds sing for you
'Cause they already know you
Yeah, they already know you
On the highway
Unpaved
Going my way
You're so alone today
Like a ghost town
I found there's no relief
No soul to mercy
Is it true what they say?
You can't behave
You gamble your soul away
Measuring your dreams
Oh, this life seems
Like the gristle of loneliness
Do do do do
Don't let the sun catch you crying
Do do do do do
Don't let the sun catch you crying
Like an ice age
Nice days on your way
Sipping the golden dregs
On a riptide
Freaks ride
Sleep inside
A parasite's appetite
Oh, say, can't you see
The chemistry?
The parasites, the cleanup fee
Death metal hands
Recycled cans
Get well cards to the hostage vans
Don't let the sun catch you crying
Do do do do do
Don't let the sun catch you crying
I got a magical ray
That reads you like a book, yeah
You got a mystic pen that sends me the message
Tests of my strength
Are pretty much all I know
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere
Climbing
Climbing
Somewhere
Somewhere
And I have no fear
I have no fear
'Cause love is here
Love is here
Love is here
Love is here
Love is...
Did you know that I'm looking at you now
With a daisy in my hair
Roses in my hand
And broken rhythms in disrepair
I hear
A danger in the air
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere
Climbing
Climbing
Somewhere

- Better be, l want Kano.
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person. You talk to her.
Good boy.
She's here.
Right on time. l love punctuality in a woman... don't you...
Mr. Shang Tsung?
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?
You killed her partner, didn't you?
She'll follow you into hell.
Just make sure she's on that boat.
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.
Have our own little honeymoon cruise. lf you so much as touch her, Kano... you'll need a seeing eye dog.
Where's Kano?
Where is he?
Let's dance.
This is where you fall down.
Where do you get these guys?
The press says l don't know how to do this stuff?
- Cut. Reset. Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.
- What do you mean?
- l won't.
- lt's the last shot! Where you going?
- To my trailer.
Then l'll shoot myself for being in your movie.
Kill me. l'll be back directing traffic.
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me! l love you. l need you.
Excuse me, there's someone who wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. l...
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.
You want me to find out?
Oh, great.
Mister, you're in my chair.
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"
Hi, Johnny.
Master Boyd.
The press is still giving you a hard time.
Yeah, they think l'm a fake.
You're one of the best martial artists in the world... and l can help you prove it.
Prove it? How?
A tournament.
The tournament. lt's held once a generation.
The world's best fighters are invited.
You win the tournament, you win their respect.
They'll tell the entire world you're the real goods.
- So how do l...?
- There's a boat.
Leaves pier forty...
Hong Kong, tomorrow.
Be on it.
"The Temple of Light, China"
Liu. ls this the place?
Yes.
This is where we found his body.
What happened?
After you left for America... he followed in your footsteps.
Preparing for the tournament.
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough to fill my head with that nonsense?
To save the world is not nonsense.
Men fighting in a simple contest don't decide these things.
How can a wise man believe this?
We all believe in it... including your brother.
Liu Kang has been given the dream.
He is the Chosen One.
No. He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.
Why have you come back? l want to represent the Order of Light at the Tournament.
For what reason?
My brother's killer will be there.
That cannot be your only reason for going... or you will fail.
Oh yes, l forgot.
We're fighting for the fate of the world.
That's why you left the temple... and ran away, isn't it?
The Great Tournament was too much responsibility.
But vengeance... that's so much simpler.
Lord Rayden.
You're still running away from your destiny.
Rayden?
Grandfather, get up.
This isn't your God of Thunder.
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.
American life has enfeebled his mind.
Too much television.
So, you're going to win the tournament?
- Yes, l am.
- Show me how.
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid... of a simple beggar? lf you are Rayden... why did you let Chan die?
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you? l've had enough of this. l'll find my brother's killer at the tournament.
With or without your consent.
He isn't ready, my Lord... and we lost so much time. l know.
But there is no one else.
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"
Ah, give me a break.
"Johnny Cage Fake!"
- Sure.
Aren't you Art Lean? l saw you fight in London, you're great.
Thanks. l saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Pal, when the ship comes in... could you put these on board?
You want me to carry your luggage? l pay money. You carry bags.
- Or is that too complicated?
- No. l got it.
Good.
Thank God l didn't ask him to park the car.
Nothing says that creep at the club wasn't lying.
Kano could be 1000 miles from here by now.
What is that?
You must be kidding me.
Wait.
That's it, Blade... come to Papa.
Sonya, don't get on that thing.
Hey, Sonya!
Hey, you.
Alright, tough guy, you want to get... tough?
No. Do you? l'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?
Where's Kano? l don't know who you're talking about.
But l can help you find him.
Out of my way.
Just another starstruck fan, huh? l'm honored to finally meet you.
Shang Tsung at your service. l'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship. l'm impressed.
But it is my boat, and if you'd like a tour... l'd love to give it to you myself.
Be nice to the lady.
She's doing her job.
When l want back-up l'll radio for it.
Got that radio handy?
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
The deadliest of enemies... but slaves under my power.
Move aside.
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.
How good of you to grace us with your... presence.
Your sideshow freaks attacked my fighters.
That is expressly forbidden before the tournament... as your emperor well knows.
My sincere apologies. lt won't happen again, l promise you.
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.
Until we reach the island... where you have no dominion.
My dominions are well known to me, sorcerer.
- Thank you.
- What tournament?
You've been chosen, Sonya.
Much to my delight.
You really are Rayden.
Come with me.
1 guy with things coming out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff... and 1 man who seems to be made out of electricity.
How did he disappear?
What's going on? Who is he?
Let's think this through.
There is a rational explanation.
He's Rayden, God of Lightening and Protector of the Realm of Earth.
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.
Listen.
What you're about to face is... vastly more important than... your ego... your enemy... or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked... on a sacred mission.
You have been chosen to defend the Realm of Earth... in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.
Defend it from who?
Your world is but one of many realms.
One of them is a forsaken land called Outworld... ruled by an immortal who has crowned himself emperor.
Now he seeks a new world to conquer and enslave.
Now, wait a second. lf this guy is so powerful... why doesn't he invade us?
To enter the Realm of Earth the Emperor's demon sorcerer,
Shang Tsung... and his warriors must win 10 straight victories in Mortal Kombat.
They have won nine.
This will be the tenth.
A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?
Exactly.
The essence of Mortal Kombat... is not about death... but life.
Mortal men and women... defending your own world.
Why are you telling me this?
What about the others?
They are all great fighters... but l have looked into their souls... and yours.
One of you will decide the outcome of the tournament.
The fate... of billions will depend upon you.
Sorry.
What about Shang Tsung?
Oh, still concerned only with vengeance? lf you challenge Shang Tsung now... you'll lose your life and your soul.
He'll pay for my brother's death.
You're not ready.
Look. lt has begun. lt has begun.
Black Hawk to Cardinal.
Black Hawk calling Cardinal. ls anybody monitoring?
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?
While you're at it, call my agent.
Do l look like your secretary?
What are you doing?
The electrical disturbance blew out the transistors.
Your radio equipment's fine.
Look at your compass.
Where the hell are we?
- Do l look like your travel agent?
- Fine.
Okay... l give up.
What's going on? l don't know.
But what if all the legends were true?
What legends?
Do you need help with those?
Ah, no more steps.
Great! Can't wait to see the bathrooms.
You know?
When a woman looks at you like that... it usually means something.
Princess Kitana.
She's our most dangerous adversary.
Watch her carefully, Reptile.
Keep her away from these humans.
Welcome.
You're here to compete in...
Mortal Kombat.
Tomorrow morning the great combat begins.
Some will have the distinct honor... and pleasure... to face Prince Goro... our reigning champion.
You are witnesses to a great turning point in the history... of your planet.
Treasure these moments... as if they were your last.
Now, for a taste of things to come...
Flawless victory.
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.
Yeah, right.
Liu.
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.
You know, you've got to admire her.
When she sets her mind on something... lt's not her mind you're admiring.
True.
How many times must l tell you? l don't need your help. l can take care of myself.
We can't help it. lt's a guy thing.
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.
Let's forget about Shang.
Forget about him? l want to get to the bottom of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Sonya...
You go ahead. Find out what that was.
Liu and l'll wait right here.
What?
See, me... l believe in a fair fight.
You know, one-on-one, man-to-man... hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.
But what l just saw wasn't very fair.
That's Kano.
Forget about Kano.
Who's the other guy?
Then he freezes this guy, right?
And then he explodes. l could see his guts and everything.
Almost lost my lunch.
Disgusting.
What l want to know... if this Shang Tsung guy's so great... how come he's got such a crummy looking boat?
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.
"Treasure these moments".
That was his intention.
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.
The wise cultivate his favor.
Those who challenge his power... become his slaves.
Yeah? l haven't seen any of them around.
You fool!
You know nothing.
He enslaves souls.
He learned the black arts from the Emperor himself.
You're some kind of royalty too...
- right?
- l am Goro! general of the armies of Outworld and prince... of the subterranean realm of Shokan.
Subterranean?
What's that, something like underground?
Yes, something like... that. l'm kind of an underworld boss.
Well... l mean, back home.
How lucky for them...
"back home". lt's true...
Prince Goro.
Why else would l have chosen such a disreputable looking cretin?
Look at him.
No dignity... no manners.
Yet in the realm of Earth... such men can amass great wealth... and almost godlike power. l'd get back to my amassing as soon as possible, if you don't mind.
Now, when do l get paid?
After you've fought the girl.
But remember... she's not to be harmed, only humiliated. l have plans for my beautiful Sonya.
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Shang Tsung?
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant is competing in the tournament.
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.
He'll pose no problem.
This is no time for foolish pride.
We've never been so close to victory.
Which is why l've come to warn you of another danger.
Princess Kitana.
The Emperor's adopted daughter?
Why should l worry about her?
Princess Kitana is 10,000 years old... and the rightful heir to the throne of Outworld.
She must not join the forces from the Realm of Earth... especially Liu Kang.
What's so special about you? l don't know.
The Emperor will not tolerate failure... and neither will l. l do not fail.
Let's get out of here.
What? What is it?
We are not alone.
Wait a second, l don't remember this.
Look!
That has to be Princess Kitana.
She's trying to help us.
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.
Forget her. She's 10,000 years old.
- So what?
- Liu?
- What happened?
- There's something here. lt's following Princess Kitana.
Where is she? l don't know.
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.
Kitana went this way. l can smell her perfume. l don't smell anything. l smell something.
Bullshit.
We got company.
Just the way l like them.
Dumb and ugly.
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.
What is it with you guys?
We're standing... they're not.
What more do you want?
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
So, why don't you show me what you plan to do about... them? l don't think so.
You'll find that this is the way out.
You guys are lucky he stopped us.
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament? lf he chooses to.
As a former champion he has the right to do so.
And he's far more dangerous than Goro.
His power comes from the souls of vanquished warriors.
To fight Shang Tsung... is to face not one... but a legion of adversaries.
Remember that.
Tomorrow the tournament begins.
Be prepared.
From this moment on... my island will be your battleground.
Liu Kang!
You will be first.
Let Mortal Kombat begin.
- Let's go!
- Yes!
Your soul is mine.
Fatality.
Sonya Blade! l have something for you, my dear. l don't want anything from you.
On the contrary. l have something you want very much.
You can thank me later.
Hello, baby.
Did you miss me?
Now look at this.
This little baby brings back memories, doesn't it?
You used it to knife your mother in the back? lt put a big smile on your partner, though. Ear... to ear...
Give it up. l've studied all your moves.
Study this.
Does it hurt, baby?
Right. Finish him.
No, Sonya. Don't!
- Give me a break!
- Okay.
Get over here!
Come here!
Welcome!
Get down here!
"To my Greatest Fan
Johnny Cage"
Begin!
Fight with all of your heart or there is no hope.
Why do you care if l win?
To win your next match, use the element which brings life.
What?
Kitana!
Remember my words.
That's enough!
You disappoint me.
Not very wise.
Use the element which brings life.
Water. ls it time?
Yes.
We've let these humans win enough.
At last.
What the...?
Yeah, that's it! ln and out!
Come on. You can do it!
Move! Use your feet.
Kick him!
Come on, Art. Get up!
Get out!
Finish him.
Get out!
Goro! Goro!
Yes! Goro!
Finish him!
Time to die.
Finish him.
Flawless victory.
Your soul is mine!
We can't win!
How can we possibly beat something like that?
Good question.
Goro can be killed.
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed by mortal men and women.
You can overcome any adversary... no matter how bizarre their powers may seem.
There is always a way.
Only one thing can defeat you:
Your own fear.
So, who says we're afraid?
You must first face your fears... if you are to conquer them.
You, Johnny, are afraid you're a fake... so you'll rush into any fight just to prove you're not.
You'll fight... bravely enough... but foolishly... carelessly... and you'll be beaten.
You, Sonya... are afraid to admit even you sometimes need help. lf you are afraid to trust... you will lose.
Wait.
Wait.
What about me?
Oh, you.
You fear your own destiny.
You already fled once when you went to America, so... you're guilty about Chan's death. l am responsible for Chan's death.
Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny.
Chan believed this.
Why can't you? l tried.
Despair is the most dangerous fear. l know this... and so does Shang Tsung.
He can peer into your soul... and use the fear he sees against you.
You must be prepared.
Liu!
You will be next.
Goro's never been beaten.
You go up against him, he'll kill you. lf l don't... then he'll finish us off one at a time. lf l challenge him now... l can finish this.
You're making this sound simple and it isn't.
Yeah, it is.
'Cause l can't let what happened to Art happen to you.
Not to you.
Oh, don't you dare do this to protect me, Johnny Cage.
Trust me. l've a plan. l don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical... self-deluded person l have ever met.
You forgot "good looking."
Challenging Goro, eh?
You weren't supposed to fight him now.
Are you that eager to die? l'm not the one who'll die. l see.
You're very foolish.
The true sign of a hero.
You want to protect your friends.
But make no mistake.
They too will die... after Goro destroys you.
So what's the problem?
As you wish.
As absurd as your request is, l shall grant it. ln return l reserve the right to challenge the winner myself.
Or another of my choosing. ln a place designated by me for the final battle... of the tournament.
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.
Too late, Lord Rayden.
The rules are quite clear. lt's... How do you say?
"A deal's a deal."
What have you done? l made a choice.
This is our tournament, remember?
Mortal Kombat.
We fight it.
Good.
At last one of them has understood.
Goro! Goro!
Finish him quickly.
Pay me my tribute.
This puny mortal will be no problem. l'll crush him in one blow.
Alright.
Let's dance.
Yes! Sorry.
You imbecile.
Damn, that hurt.
Follow him.
Finish him.
- Yes! Yes!
- Goro! Goro!
Finish him! Finish him!
Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.
This is where you fall down.
Let me go!
Stop! l hereby exercise my right to challenge. l challenge her.
You're a coward, sorcerer.
Stand and fight.
We had a deal, remember?
Mortal Kombat continues. l'm simply... changing the place... as we agreed.
- Sonya!
- Wait!
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle... in the wastelands of Outworld, where l cannot follow.
We can.
Rayden...Can Sonya beat Shang Tsung? l'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.
Neglected to mention it.
She must accept the challenge or there'll be no final combat. l have nothing further to teach you, Liu Kang.
You possess the knowledge.
All that is lacking now is the will.
You sure you don't want to go? ln Outworld, if you look hard enough... you will find another guide.
Good luck.
They'll need it.
This is not good.
But l'm fine. l can deal with this.
So... this is Outworld. l can see why they want a change of scenery.
We should head for that tower.
He'd have taken Sonya there. l hate this place. l do. l'm telling you l hate it.
A hostile environment, l'm unprepared... with people who want to kick my ass. lt's like being back in high school!
What's that?
Wait.
What?
There's something else.
Oh, great.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Reptile.
Oh no, you don't.
Well done.
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.
Kitana.
Come with me.
What happened here?
The same thing that will happen to your world... unless you prevent it.
My father was the rightful ruler of Outworld
Then his best warriors lost ten Mortal Kombats... and the Emperor entered the Realm... killed my parents and adopted me... to lay claim to the throne. but it was beautiful once... before Shang Tsung engineered its destruction.
How can l stop this from happening in my world? lf l did not believe in you... l would not have helped you. ln the Black Tower you will face three challenges.
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.
And you must face your worst fear. l will not fight you, Shang Tsung. l am not playing your game.
My sweet Sonya.
There's no one else. lf you don't fight... the Realm of Earth will forfeit the Tournament... and its portals will open... to our great Emperor.
You're lying.
My friends will come for me.
Hoping against hope.
Such an endearing human trait. l'm touched. Really.
One last chance, Sonya.
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.
Go to hell.
Take her away.
The Emperor will be overjoyed.
My friends will come.
They're already here.
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.
Will you dare interfere with the tournament... and betray our Emperor? ln his great wisdom, he knows that Mortal Kombat... cannot be won by treachery.
How dare you speak to me of treachery?
Your ignorance will lose forever... the keys to the Realm of Earth.
Very well. l challenge you.
You'll fight me. l am Liu Kang... descendant of Kung Lao. l challenge you to Mortal Kombat.
Do you accept or yield? l accept.
Leave us. l will take care.. of this impudent mortal myself.
Nice dress.
You fool.
What's that noise?
The source of all
Shang Tsung's power.
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.
Face your enemy. ls that all you've got, sorcerer?
Liu Kang! l can see into your soul.
You will die.
Face yourself.
You can look into my soul... but you don't own it.
Face your worst fear. l'm not afraid of my destiny.
Face me.
Liu.
Chan? lt can't be you.
Rayden sent me.
To help you.
You're not really Chan.
Remember when our parents died?
You promised you'd always take care of me? l remember. lt's my turn to take care of you.
Come with me. l forgive you for letting me die. lt wasn't my fault.
- Brother.
- No.
Chan chose his own path.
Every man is responsible for his own destiny.
Shang Tsung killed my brother.
You're mine.
The Chosen One. l am The Chosen One.
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.
Free them.
They are mine forever.
All those souls, and you don't have your own. l pity you, sorcerer.
Save your pity for the weak.
Surrender!
Never!
Flawless victory. l knew you'd come.
Chan.
One day... we will be reunited... but until then my spirit will always be with you.
Go in peace, my brother.
Let's go home.. l've been waiting for you.
What took you so long? l guess you knew it would end this way.
Didn't have a clue.
You humans are so unpredictable. l must tell you something... you guys did great.
- Bow to me!
- What is it?
The Emperor.
You weak, pathetic fools. l've come for your souls. l don't think so.
Re: sync by Scooby, credit to Modern Videofilm
Excellent!
Flawless victory!
Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas!
Hey, guys!
- Ho! Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
- Hey!
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?
This has been our best year ever
thanks to Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.
A- And I think we should give
a special thanks to the people...
responsible for our
record-breaking sales,
our Midwest marketing
and distribution team,
- Scott Calvin and Susan Perry!
- Yeah!
Let's hear it for 'em!
Come on!
Susan, darling, come on up here.
Aren't they adorable?
Say a few words.
Thank you very much.
This was really a team effort,
and I would just want to thank
every one of you individually...
But we don't have time
for that, do we?
In all seriousness,
um, here at B&R Toys,
we're not just about makin'
a profit in quality toys.
We're also about families.
But our families aren't
here with us right now.
Which is probably why Johnson's
secretary is sittin' in his lap.
You guys have a great party,
have a great year.
Drive safe.
Thanks very much.
Aren't they wonderful?
Laura, I was hopin' to catch you before you'd left your house.
I ran real late today. You wouldn't believe the traffic out here.
Yeah, same to you!
And that's not very ladylike!
Anyway, I'll try to get to my house as soon as I can.
Oh, there's the problem right there.
Three car pile-up.
I'm really gonna be late.
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to sing throw cares away
Christmas is here bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
Ding dong and dong, balance in song
Ring joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer
from everywhere filling the air
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
go hand in hand calling in the town
Gaily they ring while people sing
songs of good cheer, Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry
merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry
merry Christmas
On we will sing, dawn with a hymn
Angel will come to every home
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to sing throw cares away

Ding dong ding

All right. Let's go.
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Neal.
- Oh, sorry I'm late. Hi.
- Hi.
- Did you want to come in for a minute?
- Neal's waiting in the car, so...
- Why doesn't he come in?
- 'Cause, Daddy, he says you'll just end up saying something snotty.
Not necessarily. Could be rude or sarcastic. Whatever it takes.
- See? I gotta go. Here.
- Oh, come on. Come on.
Christmas Eve.
Just for a minute.
Watch those steps.
They're real slippery.
- Ooh!
- Told ya.
- So...
- Well...
- You goin' to your mom's for dinner?
- Actually, we're gonna be with Neal's family.
Ah, Christmas at the pound.
There aren't that many presents over there.
Well, that's because
Santa isn't here yet.
Neal doesn't believe in Santa.
Well, Neal's head comes to a point.
- He's smart. He's a doctor.
- He's not a doctor. He's a psychiatrist.
Take your coat off.
You're stickin' around, aren't ya?
I'll be right there.
Just a sec.
- I just want to...
- Did that jerk tell Charlie there was no Santa Claus?
What? No. Oh, Charlie came home from school the other day in tears, because some big kid told him there was no such thing as Santa.
And, you know Neal.
Well, he sat him down and...
He told him that there was a Santa Claus.
Well, all he said was that
Santa was more like a feeling.
You know, more like a state of mind than a person.
Kind of like Neal.
And who gave you permission to tell Charlie there's no Santa Claus?
I think if we're gonna destroy our son's illusions, I should be a part of it.
- Yeah, but you're never around, are you, Scott?
- Oh, oh, please.
Listen, all we are trying to do is give Charlie a firm grasp on reality.
That's a good idea. You don't want kids runnin' around usin' their imaginations.
Oh, yeah. This from the guy responsible for the Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.
- Leave her out of this.
- Don't you burp me, don't you change me
- I'm the dolly...
- Why do you guys always have to fight?
I, uh, swear we're not fighting.
It's your mom's singing.
It sounds a lot like fighting, doesn't it? Cats even.
The trouble is, Neal and your mom, they don't believe in Santa because they were real naughty.
Which is why they'll probably get lumps of coal in their stockings.
I don't know. It seems kind of babyish to believe in that kind of stuff.
What are you talkin' about? I believe in Santa Claus. I'm not a baby.
- Well...
- Maybe it's time you left.
We don't want to keep
Dr Pinhead waiting.
Come here.
Do I gotta stay?
Listen, you and your daddy are gonna have a great Christmas, okay?
- Will you pick me up tomorrow?
- Of course.
- Early?
- Yes.
We're talking sunup?
You're here?
You'll be fine. Ah, merry
Christmas, Charlie. I love you.
I love you too, Mom.
- You be a good boy, okay?
- Bye, Mom.
Four hours?
I'm dreamin'
of a white Christmas
- Your Christmas will be perfect...
- Just like the ones I used to know
... with its own
built-in turkey timer.
Where those treetops
glisten
- And now, we return to the most
cherished of Christmas stories,
- And children listen
- Miracle On 34th Street,
starring Natalie Wood and...
- To hear sleigh bells in the snow...
That is exactly why you want a high-quality fire extinguisher right in the kitchen.
Those flames were really big, Dad.
- Yeah, turkey's funny that way.
- Dad!
'Ey!
It's done.
You like osso buco, Charlie?
They're closed.
You know, Neal's a real good cook.
Yeah, and you should see him walk on water.
- You don't like him very much, do ya, Dad?
- Charlie, yeah...
I was joking, okay? I'm sorry.
I was just kiddin' around.
I like him a lo... Yeah, sure,
I like him. You know, there...
There's just something about him that makes me wanna...
Lash out irrationally?
- Where did you hear that?
- From Neal.
I learn a lot from him.
He listens to me.
Yeah. Then he charges ya for it.
I'm dreaming
- Of a white Christmas
- All right. Denny's.
- Just like the ones I used to know
- It's always open.
- I don't wanna eat here.
- What are you talkin' about?
Everybody likes Denny's.
- Where those treetops
- It's an American institution.
- Glisten
- Are you with Hatsutashi?
- No!
- Dad burnt the turkey.
- Oh, yeah. This way. Come on.
- Right over there.
- Thank you.
- Here we go.
- Burn the turkey?
- Coffee?
- No, thank you, Judy.
What do you say we start out with cold glasses... of delicious seasonal favourite eggnog?
- I don't like eggnog.
- We're out.
- Coffee. Decaf.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll have chocolate milk, please.
- We're out.
- Plain milk's fine.
- Okay.
- At least we know they got hot apple pie.
- We did.
Mm-hmm!
This is nice.
"And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap...
- I'm dreaming
- "had just settled down for a long winter's nap.
- Of a white
- "When out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter,
- Christmas
- "I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
"Away to the window
I flew like a flash.
"With a miniature sleigh and St.
Nich... and Prancer and Dancer...
...and to all a good night."
- What's that?
- What's what?
"A Rose Suchak ladder"?
It's not a ladder.
I said, "arose such a clatter."
It means, eh,
"came a big noise."
What?
Charlie, "arose" is a word that means "it came," and "clatter" is a big noise.
Now, please, go to sleep.
Shut your eyes.
How do reindeer fly?
They don't have any wings.
- Fairy dust?
- That's from Peter Pan, Dad.
- Horns.
- Antlers.
Whatever.
Their, uh, antlers give them...
You know, ther... ther... there's a slipstream effect... The air go...
T-They move fa...
They're weightless.
- But if Santa's so fat, how did he get down the chimneys?
- He sucks it in like Grandpa.
But what about people who don't have fireplaces?
How does he get into their house?
Charlie, sometimes believing in something means you... means you just believe in it.
Santa uses reindeer to fly because that's how he has to get around.
But you do believe in Santa, right, Dad?
Of course I believe in Santa.
Now, please, go to sleep.
- Dad?
- What is it, Charlie?
Maybe you better leave some cookies and milk out, just in case, okay?
Great. I'll just go preheat the oven.
And don't forget the fire extinguisher.
Good night, Charlie.
Ho!
Now, settle down there.
Dad! Dad!
- W-What?
- I heard a clatter.
- What, Charlie?
- There! A clatter!
- Charlie, what are you talkin' about?
- You know, "it came a big noise."
It's coming from outside.
Charlie, it's just the wind or somethin'.
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.
- Somebody's on the roof.
- Maybe it's Santa.
Not now, Charlie.
I want you to sit here, and I want you to stay right there.
- Charlie, do you know how to call 911?
- Sure. 911.
Yeah. Great. Stay there.
- Hey, you!
- What's that...
Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, buddy.
All right, you should just stay still. Perfect.
- You got him!
- Charlie, stay where you are.
Charlie, would you listen to me?
Stay up there!
It is Santa!
You killed him.
Did not.
And he's not Santa.
Well, he was.
He's got some I.D.
On him, I bet.
Fella, if you can hear me, I'm just lookin' for your identification.
Once I figure out who ya are, I'll...
I'll give you a lift back to the mall.
"If something should happen to me, put on my suit.
The reindeer will know what to do."
Yeah, right.
Whoa.
- Dad!
- Hey.
He disappeared.
- Whoa!
- He's naked somewhere.
- You gonna put on the suit like the card said? Are you?
- No. No.
- Come on, Dad. I wanna go too.
- Stop it, Charlie.
We're not goin' anywhere.
- You never do what I wanna do!
- Would you please be quiet for a minute so I can figure this out?
Reindeer up on the roof.
Santa suit layin' on the ground.
Guy fell. Not my fault.
Reindeer on the roof.
That is hard to explain.
It's the ladder.
Where the hell'd this come from?
Look here, Dad.
"The Rose Suchak Ladder Company."
- Huh?
- "Out by the roof there's a Rose Suchak ladder."
- Just like the poem.
- Just like the poem?
Charlie, come on down from there.
Charlie, get down from there!
Dad! You gotta see this!
- Don't touch anything!
- It's great!
I'm just gonna call the police.
I'll carry this stuff up there.
Let them deal with it, okay?
Whoa! This guy was huge.
Dad, isn't this neat?
Charlie. Charlie!
Stay away from those things.
They're reindeer.
You don't know where they've been.
They all look like they've got key lime disease.
Easy, Rudolph.
Excuse me, Comet.
Dad! Check out Santa's sleigh.
There's no such thing as Santa's sleigh.
- Sure there is. You said you believed in Santa, right?
- I did? I do.
What about the reindeer?
These are Santa's reindeer, aren't they?
I hope not.
These are, uh, a gift.
Probably from the cable company.
We're getting the Disney Channel now.
Merry Christmas.
- Now, hop out of there, please.
- I don't wanna go.
Listen, Charlie.
I'm not kidding. Let's go!
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah! Let's go! Whoa!
Charlie! Hold on, Charlie!
Whoa!
Giddyap, Comet!
Whoa, let's go!
Dad! Climb up here!
There we go!
So, uh, if we go straight on this road, and we hit I-94...
Well, we made good time.
Now what do we do?
- Get the bag of toys.
- And do what?
- Go down the chimney.
- Down the chimney?
You want me to take the toys down the chimney... into a strange house in my underwear?
No. You gotta put the suit on first.
You know what we're gonna do is we're gonna get outta here, because this whole thing is stupid.
How come everything
I wanna do is stupid?
I didn't say that.
Freezing my nubs off out here, and you want me to get into a Santa costume.
This is great.
A Santa costume.
Oh, this thing.
You never know where it's been.
A thousand malls.
Well, I hope you're happy, Comet.
Hope you're happy. But most of all,
I hope the guy that lives here is a tailor!
Nice coat.
Well, how do I look? Nice?
- You forgot the sash.
- You're right.
This completes the ensemble.
All right. Got my boots.
Now I've got the suit on. How am I supposed to know what to leave?
- Maybe there's a list.
- A list. How silly of me.
Of course there's a list.
Careful, Dad!
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay!
- Look! You're flying!
It's okay. I'm used to it.
I lived through the '60s.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Nice teeth.
Who's down there?
It's the holidays.
Come on. Come on.
Charlie, I need a little help down here!
Whoa! How'd you do that?
What'd it feel like, Dad?
It felt like
America's Most Wanted.
Now, pull me in, quick.
We gotta get outta here.
Thanks. We gotta go home.
How do you start this thing?
Just like that!
Whoa!
This could be a really long night.
Do it again, Dad. Please.
I can't. That thing's empty.
There's nothin' in the bag.
Even if there was, d-didn't you notice there's no chimney?
Where there's no chimney, there's no fireplace.
Are you growling at me?
Look, Comet, like I said, there is nothing left...
That's so weird, 'cause
I know when I did... that...
No, no, no, no, no!
Hold it!
There's no chimney here. Can you hear me? No chimney, all right?
Lookin' good, Dad.
You have got to be kidding!
Come on!
Look at the size of this thing.
Weird! Ow!
Ouch! Oh!
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.
How come your clothes are so baggy?
Because Santa is watchin' his saturated fats.
- How come you don't have a beard?
- Because I shaved!
Do you want this doll or not?
Go back to sleep.
You're supposed to drink the milk.
Look, I am lactose intolerant.
And I am just about this close to taking all those presents back up the chimney with me.
"Supposed to drink the milk."
Shut your eyes.
Yo!
How do you get in without a fireplace?
I don't know.
One just kind of appeared.
Awesome!
Oh, boy!
Charlie, look at the clouds over here.
Aren't they pret...
Charlie!
All right.
Mornin', fellas.
Mornin', sport.
We're done, Comet. Ho-ho-ho.
Back to the house.
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.
When I wake up,
I'm gettin' a CAT scan!
- Is this okay, Dad?
- No, it's not okay!
Hey, does this look like home to you guys?
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!
Where you goin'?
Come back here! Aww!
In the silence of the night
- When the snow
- Hey, hey!
- Lies soft and still
- Hey, buddy!
- You, sir! Hey!
- You can see a magic light
And hear the ring
of Christmas bells
- Can you hear me?
- Though the night seems long and dark
- It is the earth
- What's that?
- Just gone to sleep
- I don't know.
- I think it's the North Pole.
- The stars that dot
- That's the North Pole?
- The sky above
- Hey, buddy, we need some help.
- Hold you in
- Hello!
- Their precious keep
- What are you doing?
- So close your eyes and come with me
The Christmas bells
will bring you home
Hey, look!
Here comes the new Santa!
And now with song
we fill the night
While magic dances
in the light
To wish you now
and all the year
Thejoy that comes
with Christmas cheer
- Sit back.
- Hear our voices fill the air
To drive the
winter's cold away
And so our hearts
with all will share
The love that comes
with Christmas day
The love that comes
with Christmas day
The Christmas bells
will bring you home
- Where are all the grown-ups?
- This is so cool.
Stay here.
Hey, kid, kid.
Kid, who's in charge here?
You are. And I'm not a kid. I've pointy shoes that are older than you.
I'm an elf.
Uh, you guys, or you girls...
Who gives the orders? Who's your boss?
- You are.
- No, no, no. Uh...
- W-Who's the head elf?
- You are.
Hey! Who's causin' all the trouble around here?
- He is.
- She is.
Excuse me. Are we on a coffee break?
- We don't drink coffee.
- Then I guess the break is over!
Back to work. Thanks.
Take it easy on her, will ya?
Who are you?
I'm Bernard.
Nice to meet ya, Santa.
I'm not Santa! I've had a rough night.
There's been dogs barkin', guns goin' off.
Look, my back's killin' me.
Have you ever tried to shove a sea kayak down a chimney?
- I'm tired of this small talk.
- Hmm.
The other Santa disappeared, right?
Wait a minute.
Hey, I know where this is goin'.
It wasn't my fault.
The other guy fell. It was an accident.
I've got homeowner's insurance and a good attorney.
Not as good as my wife's, but let's not open up that wound.
Hold it a minute.
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How did you know the other guy was gone?
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't want a drink.
I'm thirsty and hungry too.
Charlie, I thought I told you to stay in the sleigh.
- Who's this?
- This... This is my son, Charlie.
I'm sorry. Charlie, this is Buh, Beh, Beh...
- Bernard.
- Bernard.
- Hi, Bernard.
- Hiya, sport.
- Hey, Dad, he called me "sport" just like you.
- Wonderful.
Hey, you know what.
I got somethin' for you.
Okay, now hold out your hand, all right?
Now, be very careful.
This is very old, just like me.
Shake it up, Charlie.
Wow.
Why don't you, uh, hold onto it for me for a while.
- It might come in handy.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
I promise I'll take real good care of it.
- Make sure you do.
- I will.
Hey, Dad, look!
Huh. Fabulous ball.
- Hey, Barabbas.
- Bernard!
Bernard. Can we take a direct flight back to reality, or do we have to change planes in Denver?
Uh, Larry, take Charlie here and get him some chow.
- No, Larry, don't do that. Charlie!
- He'll be okay.
Follow me. You'll want to get out of those clothes.
I... Uh... No, look, Barnaby,
I just wanna go home.
Look, I am not Santa Claus!
Ahh!
Did you or did you not read the card?
- Yeah, I read the card.
- Then you're the new Santa.
In putting on the hat and jacket you accepted the contract.
- What contract?
- The card in the Santa suit.
You said you read it, right?
So when you put on the suit, you fell subject to the Santa Clause.
- Here.
- The Santa Claus?
Oh, you mean the guy that fell off my roof?
No, no, no, not Santa Claus, the person.
Santa Clause, the clause.
What?
- Look, you're... you're a businessman, right?
- Yeah.
Okay. A clause, as in the last line of a contract.
- You got the card?
- Oh!
Okay, look.
The Santa Clause:
"In putting on this suit and entering the sleigh...
"the wearer waives any and all rights to any previous identity, real or implied,
"and fully accepts the duties and responsibilities of Santa Claus...
"in perpetuity until such time that wearer becomes unable to do so... by either accident or design."
- What does that mean?
- It means you put on the suit, you're the big guy.
- That's ridiculous.
I didn't put on the suit just to...
- Try to understand this!
Oo-oo-ooh!
Let me explain something to you, okay?
Toys have to be delivered. I'm not gonna do it. It's not my job. I'm just an elf.
It's Santa's job, but Santa fell off a roof, your roof.
You read the card, you put on the suit.
That clearly falls under the Santa Clause.
- So now you're Santa, okay?
- A question.
- What?
- When can I get outta here?
- Dad, you gotta see this place.
- You leave tomorrow morning.
You have 11 months to get your affairs in order, and you're due back here Thanksgiving.
- I'm not comin' back here on Thanksgiving.
- I'll ship the list to your house.
- What list?
- Come on, now. The list.
- He's makin'a list
- Checkin'it twice
Gonna find out
who's naughty or nice
Look, you put a "P" next to the kids who are nice and a "C" next to the naughty ones.
- "P" and "C"?
- Yeah. "P" for present,
"C" for coal, right, Bernard?
- Right.
- Wait a minute.
How do I know who's good and bad?
- You'll know.
- What if I don't want to do this?
- Don't even kid about a thing like that.
- Why not?
What if I don't buy into this Santa Clause thing?
What if I choose not to believe it?
Then there would be millions of disappointed children around the world.
You see, children hold the spirit of Christmas within their hearts.
You wouldn't want to be responsible for killing the spirit of Christmas, now, would you, Santa?
Judy will take you to your room. Get out of the suit. It needs to be cleaned.
- And taken in.
- Then get some sleep.
We've got a lot of work to do and only a year in which to do it.
- Judy.
- Santa.
- Scott Calvin.
- Follow me.
- I'll just take the next train.
- Dad, come on!
Charlie!
- Come on, Dad!
- Charlie, wait up!
- That's funny. I like that.
- I like that too. But I don't like...
Wow!
Can I get you anything?
The kitchen's always open.
How about a stiff drink?
You should get some sleep.
Here are your pyjamas.
I'll be right back.
Oh, oh, look, Judy.
Look. Look over there.
There's a...
Look. Look over there.
I know.
Look. Look over there.
There's a canoe. Aha, it's true.
Oh, look, there's an emu.
- Look at him.
- Shoo.
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.
- I brought you some cocoa.
- No, thanks.
My own recipe. Took me
1200 years to get it right.
- 1200 years?
- That's right.
You know, I must say, you look pretty good for your age.
Thanks, but I'm seeing someone in wrapping.
This is good.
This is really good.
Not too hot, extra chocolate, shaken, not stirred.
You look distressed.
Distressed?
I'm way past distressed.
- Why's that?
- I'm talking to an elf.
And I stopped believing in Santa Claus a long time ago.
That's not surprising.
Most grown-ups can't believe in magic.
It just... sort of grows out of them.
Look, you're a nice little elf.
- Thanks.
- But this is a dream.
I mean, this is fabulous.
Is that a polar bear directin' traffic down there?
I... I see it, but I don't believe it.
- You're missing the point.
- What is the point?
Seeing isn't believing; believing is seeing.
Kids don't have to see this place to know that it's here.
They just... know.
Well, you should get some rest.
Good night, sir.
Dad!
Dad!
Wake up, sleepy!
Come on, get up!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Come on, Dad! Come on!
You should see all the neat toys.
- Stop shakin' me, Charlie.
- Come on. Get up. Get up!
- Okay!
- Come on. It's Christmas morning.
- Great! G-Go and make some coffee.
- Come on, Dad. Let's go!
Okay. Okay.
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah. Just fine. Just fine.
Are you having a heart attack?
I know CPR.
No, I was just...
- S. C?
- Yeah, Santa Claus.
Hey. Same initials as your name, Dad.
Scott Calvin.
What?
Oh, Charlie! Oh, merry Christmas, honey!
- Did you have a good time?
- Great time! The best!
Great... Oh, ho, Scott.
Nice P.J.s. Very festive.
- Where'd you get them?
- I don't know.
- Judy gave them to you.
- Judy. Really.
- Who?
- Up in the North Pole.
Ah, one of Santa's little helpers.
Last night, Dad and me went with the flying reindeer.
It was really neat, Mom. Dad was Santa, and Larry showed me the workshop.
- You know, where they make all the toys?
- Gee, thanks for...
- keeping his feet on the ground.
- You bet.
Honey, you go wait in the car for a minute, okay? I'll be right there.
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye, Dad. Thanks for a great night at the North Pole.
So, uh, what have you been telling him?
Nothing. It's just...
I had this really strange dream.
And I... I must have told him all about it.
Wait!
- Charlie.
- Scott.
- Hi, Dad.
- Nice jammies.
- Thanks. About what you said in the house.
- Who showed you the workshop?
- The elf.
- How'd I get the pyjamas?
- I told you. Judy.
Oh, wait. Wait. Judy was the name of the waitress at the restaurant last night.
- Some waitress gave you pyjamas?
- What's this all about?
Dad took me to the North Pole, and Larry showed me the workshop.
- The North Pole.
- Yeah. Dad's the new Santa.
The regular Santa fell off the roof, and Dad put on the suit.
Charlie, we'll discuss this at home.
The clause.
The Santa Clause.
It's just a dream.
Stuff like that doesn't happen.
It was a dream. Come on!
I don't even wear pyjamas!
Normally I sleep naked. Buck naked.
Ha! Morning, Mrs McGloin.
Mary Catherine.
Eyes front,
Mary Catherine.
Sometimes boxer shorts.
You know.
So, remember, kids, there is nothing more painful than third degree burns.
Well, thank you,
Fireman O'Hara.
And I think the whole class will join me in saying... sorry about your partner.
Well, perhaps this is a good time to bring up the psychiatrist.
Charlie, would you like to introduce your, um...
Dr Miller?
Can I ask Dad to go first?
Well, if that's how you feel, Charlie.
That's how he feels, Neal.
Come on. Nice sweater, buddy.
This is my dad, Scott Calvin.
He's got a really neat job.
- Thank you, Charlie.
- My dad is Santa Claus.
Oh, boy! I think what he means is,
I'm like Santa Claus.
We're both giving.
We're both jolly.
And we both work very hard one day a year.
- Oh, boy.
- That's not what I mean, Dad.
Look, on Christmas Eve, my dad pushed Santa off the roof.
- No, Charlie... Ch... Charlie.
- Santa disappeared and my dad took his place.
- Charlie!
- Then I went with him to deliver all the presents.
Then the reindeer flew us to the
North Pole where the head elf,
- Charlie.
- Bernard, gave me this.
Look, I work for a toy company.
I deliver toys all over the country.
So, in a way,
I'm like Santa Claus.
- Yes, sweetheart?
- Do you make the toys?
No, stupid, the elves do!
Bobby, we don't say "stupid," and we don't say "elves."
They're little people.
- No, but they really are elves.
- Whatever, honey.
- Which one's your favourite reindeer?
- Comet.
Uh, I, I, I don't have a favourite.
So, let me get this straight, Santa.
You mean, when I grow up, if I wanna be Santa Claus, all I gotta do is push you off a roof?
All right, he said that. He said that it was the best Christmas he ever had.
- Oh, big surprise. What do you think?
- It's just nice to hear it from him.
- Is that a problem with you?
- That's my responsibility, isn't it?
- All right. So?
May I speak, please?
I am a doctor.
No, he's not.
He's a psychiatrist.
Please. Go ahead, Dr Miller.
I guess we know who's the teacher's pet.
Scott! Oh, grow up.
The reason we're here is that this is far more serious... than a boy believing or not believing in Santa Claus.
That's right, because Charlie thinks that this whole thing actually happened.
Scott, what was the last thing you and Charlie did... before you went to bed
Christmas Eve?
We shared a bowl of sugar; did some shots of brown liquor; played with my shotguns; field dressed a cat; looked for women.
- I read him a book.
- What book?
Uh, Hollywood Wives.
The Night Before Christmas, folks.
Come on!
And did you go to the North Pole?
T-This is ridiculous.
I don't have time for this.
Ridiculous or not, Scott, for Charlie, this isn't some dream.
It is real.
You need to sit down with Charlie. Explain to him... you are not Santa Claus.
They're like the bears at the North Pole, Dad.
Charlie, I already told ya.
We did not go to the North Pole.
- That was a dream.
- You're in denial, Dad.
Denial. You don't even know what that means.
Well, you are.
I know what happened.
How do you know that?
How? You don't have any proof.
- Proof?
- Why can't we both think of it as just a great dream and forget about it?
What about this? Remember all the neat stuff inside?
Charlie, this is a toy.
We used to make things like this at work, but no one bought 'em.
Here. I don't wanna talk about this any more.
I know who you are, Dad.
You'll figure it out soon enough.
There are a lot of kids that believe in you. You can't let them down.
Charlie, you're wrong.
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.
He sees you
when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've
been bad or good
Rollin'
Keep those reindeer rollin'
Okay, you better watch out
You better not cry
- You better not pout I'm tellin' you why
- Come on, Dancer. Come on, Prancer.
- Santa Claus is coming
- Whoa! We can't stop.
- To town
- But I have to go to the bathroom.
I told you, you should've gone before we left the North Pole.
And rummy tum-tums
Whoa! Right here.
Turn over here.
Curly-haired dolls
that toddle and coo
Elephant spokes
and kiddie cars too
- Where is he?
- Well, he could be in his room, jumping up and down on his bed wearing a red hat and galoshes.
I don't care what Neal's doing.
Where's Charlie?
Oh, ho, ho.
Oh, I see, I see.
Well, if you can't be father of the year, why not be Father Christmas, huh?
Charlie, it's just not logical.
How can one man in one night... visit all the children of the world?
Not everyone celebrates Christmas.
And I think there's some sort of time continuum that breaks down once Santa's in his sleigh.
What about fireplaces?
A lot of people don't have them.
How does Santa visit those people?
He turns into Jell-O and...
The fireplace kind of appears, and he goes through it like this.
What about the reindeer?
- Have you ever seen a reindeer fly?
- Yes.
- Well, I haven't.
- Have you ever seen a million dollars?
No!
Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Hey, Neal.
Howdy, sport.
- Hi, Dad.
- You wanna take a walk?
I wanna talk to you.
- Sure. I'll get my coat.
- Okay. Hustle up.
Scott? Can I have a minute?
Sure.
I think Charlie is conflicted at the moment.
Wow. Really?
Boy. Hmm. Appreciate your analysis. I really do.
But, boy, you got more important things to worry about, you know.
Like, where are you gonna get more sweaters after the circus pulls outta town?
Scott! I mean, you're not listening.
We are very concerned about this.
Concerned about what?
This...
If Charlie spending time with you is the best thing for him.
You were right about the sweater, okay?
Do you think by next year
I'll be big enough to drive the sleigh all by myself?
- No!
- But I've been practising.
No, that's not what I'm talkin' about.
Charlie, hold on a second.
We've got to talk about this Santa Claus thing.
Charlie, there... there is no...
No what, Dad?
There's no reason why we have to tell anybody about the North Pole.
- Why not?
- Well, sometimes some things, big things, should remain un... unsaid, like between two people...
- Oh, you mean like a secret.
- Yes. Like a secret.
Let's keep it a secret.
How come?
Because of Mom and Neal.
Not just because of them.
There's school.
Everybody thinks... Well, it's not important what they think.
It...
How does five bucks sound to ya?
This is something I really want you to do for me, sport.
I want to keep this secret.
Will ya do that, please?
- Okay, Dad.
- All right.
Great.
You don't have to worry about the Santa Claus thing any more.
So when do I get the five bucks?
... 15 in the morning.
It's gonna be a beautiful day.
Spend the day with me,
Larry B.
Huh?
Something's wrong with the mirror.
What? Something's wrong with the scale.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh...
Hmm. I'll have a field green salad and... Oh, my God.
- What the...
- What? Scott?
Calvin?
Sorry, um, the dry cleaner in my neighbourhood went up in smoke.
Some big chemical fire.
All my clothes, poof, gone.
God. Your... Your weight.
What happened?
Bee sting.
Evidently I'm allergic.
Almost killed me. But the guy at the emergency room says... the swelling will go down.
I hope. So, did I miss anything?
No, we were, uh, just about to order lunch.
Great! I'm starving.
I'll have a salad and iced tea and dressing on the side.
Uh, pasta and tomatoes, uh, and very light on the oil. Can you do that?
And I'll have a Caesar.
No dressing.
And one of those home-made cookies, the warm chocolate chip. No nuts.
And, uh, a little slice of cheesecake.
Uh, creme brulee... and, um, hot fudge sundae, extra hot fudge.
On the side.
- Anything to drink?
- Ice-cold milk.
- Stung by a bee, Scott?
- A big bee.
Finished?
Okay, now, remember.
This is just a storyboard.
But here is our preliminary...
Total Tank TV spot.
Okay, now, we've got Santa.
He's up in the North Pole.
He's gettin' ready for... Christmas!
- Oh, no.
- Problem?
It's just a little thing.
The elves.
- What about the elves?
- They look so funny.
They're supposed to look funny.
They're elves.
Just my opinion.
Can't they look a little younger... with silver specks on their cheeks?
- Can we continue here?
- Okay.
Now, this year Santa's not goin' out in a sleigh.
This time he's goin'
Total Tank.
Wait a minute! No way! No way Santa's goin' anywhere without his sleigh.
He would if he's tryin' to sell the Total Tank.
Well, isn't that a pretty picture.
Santa's rollin' down the block in a panzer.
Well, kids, I... I certainly hope you've been good this year.
'Cause it looks like Santa just took out the Pearson home.
- Incoming!
- Oh, please.
And another thing.
What about the reindeer?
Reindeer and Santa. Santa and reindeer.
I-It's kind of a package deal.
- Calvin.
- You don't believe in Santa, do ya?
Calvin, can we get back to the presentation?
I'm not done yet.
Since we've opened this box, have any of you tried to build the Total Tank?
It's got 10,000 parts, and even if you do get it together, it breaks ten minutes later.
- Then you gotta spend more money just to buy new parts.
- I thought that was the whole point.
No, no, no, no.
What we gotta do is develop a, a basic, simple, inexpensive toy... that will nurture a child's creative thinking.
- Calvin...
- Here, try the brown ones.
Can I see you outside a minute?
I don't know what's happening to you.
You're starting to look like the Pillsbury dough boy.
- Y-You're falling apart.
- I know! I know.
- I don't know what came over me.
- W-Well, just get some help.
You know, y-you should s-see a doctor, a shrink, a dietician, anything.
Just get some help.
Okay, Scott. Time is up.
- Let's get over here and check your pulse.
- All right.
Okay, hmm?
Huh? Well, nuts. I...
Oh, no, uh, your pulse is great. I...
Well, I-I don't know, Scott.
Y-You're as healthy as a horse.
Yeah, Clydesdale.
Okay, look. So, what?
You put on a little weight.
A little weight? Does this look like a little weight to you?
Well, weight can fluctuate from year to year.
Fluctuate? You make it sound like I'm retainin' water.
I've gained 45 pounds in a week.
Pete, what's happenin' to me?
- Well, what's your diet like?
- Milk and cookies.
- Really?
- But I don't finish all the milk.
Well, then, there is your problem. Just try to cut back on the sweets, okay?
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
How fast does hair grow?
Facial hair?
- What?
- I shave in the morning and in the afternoon I look like this.
Well, it could be a hormonal imbalance.
- That would explain the mood swings.
- Mood swings?
- Yeah, well, look at my hair.
It's turnin' grey.
- Oh, it's middle age, buddy.
It happens. And with that body, you should be thankful you have hair.
Look, i-if it bothers you, you can dye it, and you should diet!
Ah, just kidding.
Okay, up with the shirt.
Let's take a listen to the old ticker. Whoa. Okay.
Ooh, it's cold.
Over here, Steve!
I'm open!
What?
I want some ballet slippers.
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Hold on now.
- Wait a minute. Wait, I'm not done.
Fax me. Hi. Hey, this probably looks pretty odd, doesn't it?
- These kids lined up all by themselves.
- Scott,
I think it's safe to say you're taking this Santa thing to an unhealthy level.
Here's my card.
Call me.
Scott, I... I really have to tell you that this is beginning to scare me.
I never in my wildest...
Well, no, okay, maybe my wildest...
But certainly never in my normal dreams would I...
- But then this is Scott we're talking about and I...
- Laura, the point.
It's just I never thought you would stoop to changing your physical appearance... in order to make
Charlie like you.
- Do you have any concept of how dangerous this is to a little boy?
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa. "How dangerous"?
- Mom, what's the matter?
- Come on, Charlie, we're going home.
- But we just started.
Well, a...
You let him stay. I'll go.
If you don't get your act together,
Scott, so help me...
- Watch it, folks.
- I will just... Oh!
- Mom!
- Come on. Move it, lady!
Kick it!
- Hi there.
- Hi. I got a delivery for S.C.
- You S. C?
- Scott Calvin, that's me.
Sign here, please.
- All right.
- Thanks. I'll get your packages.
- Packages?
- Yeah, there's quite a few of them.
Great. I'll leave the door open.
Just leave them inside here.
Will do.
It's the list.
"Armand Assante"?
Yo!
Hold it! Hold... Oh!
Hold it!
- You! You! Take that! Come on! Come on!
- Stay away from the truck.
What am I supposed to do with all these packages, guys? Come on.
Aah.
You know, I knew it. I knew that... that something was going on. I just... I...
What I can't believe is that he would go behind our backs all this time, confusing Charlie again just...
I... I... What are we...
What are we supposed to do?
Well, there's one obvious alternative.
Okay.
Aah.
- Annie, nice.
- Beep!
- Johnny, naughty.
- Johnny, wait up.
Gary, nice.
Veronica, very nice.
In your dreams, sleigh boy.
Huh?
I'm in big trouble.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Judge Wayland's office.
Charlie, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?
It's okay, honey. Come on.
We won't be long.
Are we doing the right thing, Neal?
- Something needs to shake Scott.
- Yeah, but...
But to... to take away his visitation rights.
Honey, the man is delusional.
Okay, okay, so maybe I'm having second thoughts, kind of. I just...
I mean, what was so bad about
Charlie believing in Santa?
Well, he's a little old.
Oh, come on, Laura.
Don't you remember when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
I was Charlie's age,
I guess, I...
I wrote Santa a letter every week that year.
Well, you know, okay, you know, maybe...
Maybe not every week, but...
Boy, I really wanted a "Mystery Date" game.
Do you remember those?
No. Of course you don't.
You know, no one does.
I... I don't even think they make them any more, but...
Well, anyway...
Christmas morning came and...
Oh, I got dozens of presents.
Oh, I got everything.
Except "Mystery Date."
I was three, and it was an Oscar Meyer wienie whistle.
Christmas came.
No wienie whistle.
And that's when
I stopped believing.
You were three?
Yeah.
Oh, Neal.
- Where's Charlie? I want to talk to him.
- He's with the judge.
Dad!
It's all okay.
I told the judge everything... about you and the North Pole.
After reviewing all of your testimonies,
I've come to a very difficult decision.
I'm sorry to do this in light of the holiday season, but in the best interest of the child,
I'm granting the petition of Dr and Mrs Miller.
Mr Calvin, as of today, all of your visitation rights are suspended... pending a hearing after the first of the year.
- Hey, Neal.
- Scott.
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Don't make me beat you up, Neal.
Oh, would Santa really beat someone up?
- I'm this close.
- So you still believe you're Santa?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
Of course you are, Dad.
How can you say that?
- Think of all those kids.
- The only kid I'm thinkin' about is you.
Dad, I'm fine.
You can't let them down.
- They all believe in you!
- Charlie, listen.
You listen!
You think you know who he is. You don't!
Charlie. Honey, listen.
You're confused.
I know exactly who he is.
Charlie, he's not Santa!
He is too, Santa!
We went to the North Pole together.
I saw it. The elves are real old even though they look like me.
Bernard called me sport,
'cause he knew everything.
Right, Dad?
Remember!
Thank you, Charlie.
Thank you.
I love you, Dad.
Could you guys leave us alone for a minute?
I mean, so I can say goodbye to him properly?
You saw!
You saw the ball come to life.
You bet I did.
- Well, Charlie, I guess I... I better go.
- I'll get my stuff.
Well, wait, sport. Sport. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think it's a much better idea if you just stayed here with your mom.
I wanna be with you, Dad.
Boy, I love hearing you say that.
You mean I can go?
Boy, this bird is dry. Haven't you people heard about basting?
Bernard!
- Hiya, sport.
- Bernard, can I go?
Please, can I go, Bernard?
It's okay with me.
Charlie, if, uh...
Charlie?
Scott!
Charlie!
This is our perpetrator.
Scott Calvin, 38 years old.
Believes himself to be Santa Claus.
Ladies and gentlemen, this one's not gonna be easy to find.
Uh, won't the bright red suit and beard give him away?
Charlie's got some great ideas on how to keep you safe.
Santa, this is Quintin, head of research and development.
- Quintin, good to meet ya.
- Hello, Santa.
Charlie and I have put our heads together, and I think we've got a few surprises for you.
This is some of the best stuff that's come out of the workshop since the ball.
Fabulous.
What happens if I fall off the roof?
Is this the most current photo you have?
Hold on.
- Hello?
- Mom.
- Oh, Charlie. Oh, my God.
Honey, how are you? Are you...
Are... Where are you? Are you okay?
I'm fine.
We're up at the North Pole.
Charlie, are you sure you're okay?
I'm terrific! I'm helping
the elves build a new sleigh.
We're trying for a vertical takeoff.
Well, gotta go. The elves need me.
- No, Charlie, wait. No, don't hang up the phone, honey.
- Don't worry, Mom. Everything's fine.
- See you at Christmas.
- Charlie, don't... Ah.
Fireplaces will no longer be a problem.
It's a new fabric.
Completely flame retardant.
- It's light, yet durable.
- And you can wear the jumpsuit under your coat and pants.
But what do I do if I fall off a roof?
We'll cordon off a three-block radius around Dr Miller's house.
Now, Calvin is to be apprehended unharmed.
And remember, he'll probably be dressed like Santa Claus.
Give it your best shot
'Cause what you got is
oh, so sweet
- Freeze!
- What the...
I need a routine
So gimme all your lovin'
- It's not even my suit. It's a rental.
- All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
"From Comet, To Santa."
Did you make the card?
It's a nice rope.
Just in case I fall off the roof?
Comet, this means a lot to me.
Thanks, buddy.
And if I blow my top
Will you let it
go to your head
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
All right, let's go!
- You ready to go, sport?
- You betcha, Dad.
- Gimme all your lovin'
- Now Dasher, now Dancer!
Now Prancer and Vixen!
- All your hugs and kisses too
On Comet, on Cupid!
On Donner and Blitzen!
Bye-bye. Bye, Quintin.
Bye, Peewee.
Merry Christmas.
Take your time.
Turn to your right.
Hello!
No.
- Charlie, stay in your seat.
- I gotta show you this.
Radar-jamming jingle bells, snow screen,
DC-10 alert and air freshener.
- Wow.
- And most important of all, your hat.
- My hat?
- It's lined with a two-way radio.
Microphone's in here.
It connects you directly to Judy.
- Wait a minute. What's this?
- Oh, that's a C.D.
- Compact disc.
- No. Cookie/ cocoa dispenser.
The cocoa comes out nice and hot.
- And... out pops the cookie.
- Gimme all your lovin'
- How could I have done this without you, Charlie?
- You couldn't.
- You're fatter this year.
- Thank you very much. You've grown too.
And you were a very good girl this year, but I want you to go back to sleep, okay?
- I think the milk's a little sour.
- It's soy milk.
- Huh?
- You said you were lactose intolerant.
I did say that, didn't I?
Thanks for remembering.
Go to sleep.
- Merry Christmas, Sara.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
Look, there's Mom and Neal's street!
Can we go there next?
- Sure.
- I made something for them at the workshop.
Freeze!
Ah, ho, ho.
You officers really gave me a start.
Merry Christmas, guys.
- Not for you, fat boy.
- "Fat boy"? Guys.
- Uh-uh-uh. Nice and easy now.
- Oh!
Guys, guys, I got a lot of work to do.
This is a big mistake, really.
You gotta watch the suit too. This is so old. It's an antique, you know.
- Where's the boy?
- He's in the sleigh.
We got Calvin.
We're bringing him out.
Santa, are you okay?
Over. Over.
- Watch your head.
- Santa, are you all right?
- Santa?
- It'll be okay, kids.
- Let him go! Let Santa go!
Honey, I'm sure
Charlie's fine.
We've got a problem. Santa was at the Miller's, but he's not responding.
Well, time to deploy E.L.F.S.
- Let's go!
- Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Move it!
Look, I know you're Scott Calvin.
You know you're Scott Calvin.
So let's make this simple.
I say, name.
You say, Scott Calvin.
Name?
Kriss Kringle.
- Name?
- Sinter Klas.
- Name?
- Pere Noel.
Buono Natale.
Pelz-Nicole.
Topo Gigio.
Okay, Calvin. Maybe a couple of hours in the tank will change your mind.
- Charlie?
- Yeah?
Don't worry.
We're the good guys.
Come on.
Let's go save Santa.
We can't. The police are watching this place.
Yeah, they probably are.
But you see, we weren't figuring on walking out the front door.
We find that we can get around a lot faster if we fly.
Now... grab hold of my hand.
And hang on tight.
- And Charlie?
- Yeah?
Don't ever try this without elf supervision.
Hmm? Ah!
We're looking for Santa Claus.
Go home, kids.
Visiting hours are over.
We're not kids, and we're not visiting.
- We're here to bust out my dad.
- You're the Calvin boy.
Who... Who are these other kids?
We're your worst nightmare.
Elves with attitude.
Shouldn't have had that doughnut.
Oh!
Untie me! I mean it!
Untie...
- Charlie!
- Are you okay, Dad?
I am now.
- How'd you do that?
- Tinsel. Not just for decoration.
Hmm.
Hey, excuse me. Can I get some of that tinsel?
Mom?
Mom!
Neal. I'm home!
Charlie?
- Charlie?
- Charlie.
- Oh, my God, Charlie.
Sweetheart. Oh, God.
Come here. Come here.
Oh, my boy.
Oh, my sweetheart.
Oh! My boy, you're home!
Oh, I missed you so much.
How are you?
- I'm fine, Mom.
- Are you okay? Look at me.
- Oh, Charlie. I missed you, honey.
- Mom, I'm fine. It's okay.
- We were so worried about you. Look at you.
- Mom, put me down. Stop kissing me!
I don't have a lot of time.
Did you leave the gifts
I made under the tree?
- You bet I did.
- We better go.
- No, Charlie. No, no, no.
- No! No, wait, Charlie.
It's okay, Laura.
Actually, I...
I think it's a much better idea...
- that you stay here with your Mom and Neal.
- Really?
- But, Dad...
- No buts, Charlie.
I can't be selfish.
I can't be with you all the time.
We're a family.
You, me, your mom... and Neal.
And they need to be with you too.
I miss you too much.
Come here a minute.
Ah, listen to me.
Come on, listen. There's...
There's a lot of kids out there.
Okay? Millions of kids.
And they're...
They all... They all believe in me.
They're countin' on me, Charlie. And I...
I'm not gonna let them down.
I got a lot of work to do.
So I can't be selfish either.
You gave me a wonderful gift, Charlie.
Listen, a wonderful gift.
You believed in me when nobody else did.
You helped make me Santa.
Selfish? Come on.
You're the least... the least selfish person I know.
I love you, Santa Claus.
I love you, son.
Shh.
It's okay.
Okay. It's okay. Shh.
Laura, what do you think? Christmas Eve you guys spend with Charlie?
Oh, my God.
It's you.
It really is you.
You really are...
Santa Claus.
Pretty cool, huh?
Oh, my God.
And your parents thought
I'd never amount to anything.
Oh, wait. Don't go yet.
I have something for you. I...
It's Santa!
- Scott.
- Neal.
- Santa?
- It's okay, Neal.
Here.
It's, um...
Well, it's...
It's my Christmas present for you.
It's the, um... It's the custody papers.
And I want you to come and see
Charlie as often as you can.
You can count on it.
Thanks, Laura.
Merry Christmas.
What's all this boo-hooing goin' on here? Hey, how ya doin'?
It's nothin', Bernard.
I'm just saying goodbye to Charlie.
What goodbye? Charlie, you still got the glass ball, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, all you gotta do... is shake it whenever you want to see your dad.
- Really?
- He can come back to see you... anytime day or night.
Hey, have I ever steered ya wrong?
Nice sweater.
Hey, did we make this?
Laura.
He's sucking us into his delusions.
Look at the elaborate measures he's taken.
Neal, relax.
I'll explain it to you later.
Where'd he go?
Go, go, go, go!
Team one, heads up!
- Okay, stand back, folks.
Give us some room.
- I'm scared, Dad.
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks. Return to your homes!
- Stay off the street. Come on, folks.
Let us do our job here.
- Oh, my gosh. Um...
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.
Um, you know, you don't have to send anybody... Oh, my gosh, wait!
- Hey!
- He's my ex-husband, and he's already up the chimney.
Chief, look up there.
Oh, Santa!
Santa Claus.
Look!
What is it?
Oh, wow!
Up there! Do you see it?
Hey, do you see it?
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Bye, Dad.
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!
- I'm sorry, Charlie.
- That's okay, Neal.
You were just denying your inner child.
You're gonna make a great psychiatrist one day, kid.
No, I think I'm going to go into the family business.
Look out below!
My wienie whistle.
Bye, Santa Claus. Bye.
- Merry Christmas.
- See you next year.
Charlie?
Time to come inside.
Mom, this stupid ball's not working.
Shoot.
- Hey, sport.
- Dad!
You miss me already?
I've been gone, what? Ten minutes.
Gimme a break.
I was on my way to Cleveland.
Come here and give me a hug.
Oh!
- Do you wanna go for a quick ride?
- Yeah!
- Uh...
- Of course, it's up to your mom.
Please, Mom.
Go on. Get outta here.
All right. Hold on.
- On our way.
- Bye, Mom.
Just... Just a quick one.
And, uh, not over any oceans, Scott.
- Bye, Mom!
- Scott.
- Bye.
- Scott!
Santa!

<b>except for one person.</b>
<b>l'm going to play professional baseball.</b>
<b>What are you going to play?</b>
<b>l don't know. As a kid, l was a pitcher.</b>
<b>l think outfield,</b>
<b>because it'll be hard for me to pitch.</b>
<b>Let's get out of here. This stinks.</b>
<b>Don't bring me again.</b>
<b>Don't bring me again.</b>
<b>Are you listening?</b>
<b>Did you hear him? Did you hear him?</b>
<b>That little brat is right.</b>
<b>l told you, if l've told you once...</b>
<b>...l told you a thousand, thousand,</b>
<b>thousand, thousand times!</b>
<b>We need new attractions!</b>
<b>New ones!</b>
<b>Get it?</b>
<b>Big, shiny new things.</b>
<b>Absolutely, sir.</b>
<b>Look at me and listen:</b>
<b>The customer is always right!</b>
<b>Right!</b>
<b>The customer is always right!</b>
<b>Exactly!</b>
<b>Always!</b>
<b>Right!</b>
<b>Okay, we need something.</b>
<b>We need something...</b>
<b>...nutty!</b>
<b>Something wacky.</b>
<b>Wacky!</b>
<b>We need something, something....</b>
<b>Looney? Oops!</b>
<b>Looney. Thank you!</b>
<b>Looney?</b>
<b>Yes! Looney!</b>
<b>Now you're talking!</b>
<b>Looney! Looney! That's it!</b>
<b>That's the word l was looking for!</b>
<b>Get the Looney Tunes.</b>
<b>Bring them here.</b>
<b>Sir, just noticing...</b>
<b>...they're from Earth.</b>
<b>What if they can't come?</b>
<b>What did you say?</b>
<b>What if they can't come?</b>
<b>Make them.</b>
<b>Cool.</b>
<b>Make them!</b>
<b>We're gonna get them!</b>
<b>Strike!</b>
<b>Looks good in that uniform.</b>
<b>Looks great. Can't teach that.</b>
<b>Can't teach it.</b>
<b>Thanks for autographing</b>
<b>that basketball for my kid.</b>
<b>l'm happy to do it.</b>
<b>Let's go!</b>
<b>Curve ball. Don't swing.</b>
<b>Don't...swing.</b>
<b>Ball!</b>
<b>Fastball, outside corner. Swing.</b>
<b>Strike!</b>
<b>That was your pitch.</b>
<b>l know, l missed it.</b>
<b>l'll get you another one.</b>
<b>Podolak!</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>-l'm sorry, l didn't mean to--</b>
<b>-Come here!</b>
<b>Make sure that nobody bothers Michael.</b>
<b>l want him to be the happiest player.</b>
<b>Slider. Don't swing.</b>
<b>Strike three!</b>
<b>l told you not to!</b>
<b>l couldn't help it.</b>
<b>l know. Nice talking to you!</b>
<b>We're not worried.</b>
<b>Good cut.</b>
<b>That was a good-looking strikeout.</b>
<b>You look good when you strike out.</b>
<b>When l do, it looks nasty.</b>
<b>At least you look good. Good-looking.</b>
<b>Hi, Mr. Jordan.</b>
<b>l'm Stan Podolak.</b>
<b>Oh, jeez.</b>
<b>You okay?</b>
<b>That was a nasty fall.</b>
<b>l'm Stan Podolak, Mr. Jordan,</b>
<b>the Baron's new publicist.</b>
<b>l'm here to make your life easier.</b>
<b>Can l drive you somewhere?</b>
<b>You want me to pick up your laundry,</b>
<b>baby-sit your kids?</b>
<b>l am here to personally guarantee...</b>
<b>...that no one will ever bother you.</b>
<b>What was that?</b>
<b>Hang on!</b>
<b>-Hanging on!</b>
<b>-Hanging on!</b>
<b>Are we there yet?</b>
<b>-Bombastic!</b>

<b>You irascible bunny!</b>

<b>All right, you pesky rabbit.</b>
<b>l've got you now!</b>
<b>One small step for moi....</b>
<b>One giant leap for Moron Mountain!</b>
<b>And one whopper headache for Elmer Fudd.</b>
<b>Diminutive, ain't they?</b>
<b>We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.</b>
<b>-Have you seen him?</b>
<b>-Where is he?</b>
<b>ls he around?</b>
<b>Bugs Bunny, Bugs Bunny.</b>
<b>Say, does he have great big long ears?</b>
<b>Like this?</b>
<b>Does he hop around...</b>
<b>...like this?</b>
<b>Does he say, ''What's up, doc?'' like this:</b>
<b>What's up, doc?</b>
<b>Nope! Never heard of him.</b>
<b>You know,</b>
<b>maybe there is no intelligent life...</b>
<b>...out in the universe after all.</b>
<b>Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune.</b>
<b>What do you think we are? Stupid?</b>
<b>Don't move a muscle.</b>
<b>Okay, bunny, gather up your Tune pals.</b>
<b>-We're taking you for a ride.</b>
<b>-Move it.</b>
<b>Totally. All right.</b>
<b>So, like, where are we going?</b>
<b>Are we there yet?</b>
<b>-Sorry it took so long.</b>
<b>-Don't worry about it.</b>
<b>That exit on 65 wasn't clearly marked.</b>
<b>-Hold up, right here.</b>
<b>-Here?</b>
<b>Thanks, Sherm.</b>
<b>-Appreciate it.</b>
<b>-lt's Stan, Mike.</b>
<b>You can call me Sherm if you want.</b>
<b>l follow your career and l think you're</b>
<b>the greatest athlete that's ever lived.</b>
<b>How do l get out?</b>
<b>The door doesn't work.</b>
<b>lt's a classic.</b>
<b>lt's a classic, but it's got</b>
<b>a few peccadillos. Hold on.</b>
<b>A few?</b>
<b>lt's smoking too.</b>
<b>Thanks for the ride.</b>
<b>This is nice. This is a nice house.</b>
<b>Beautiful. What is that, Colonial?</b>
<b>lt's a nice house.</b>
<b>lf you need help with the house....</b>
<b>l'm fine, thanks.</b>
<b>You gave me a ride. Thanks.</b>
<b>l'll drive tomorrow, so l don't need a ride.</b>
<b>But thanks, though.</b>
<b>Too conspicuous?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>Thanks, though.</b>
<b>-Tomorrow!</b>
<b>-See you tomorrow.</b>
<b>Come on! No, not today!</b>
<b>Get off me! Your breath!</b>
<b>Mr. Jordan, are you okay?</b>
<b>Get off of him, Charles!</b>
<b>Bad dog! Git!</b>
<b>Pooch, stop it!</b>
<b>Get off of him before l cook you!</b>
<b>Come on, come on, baby.</b>
<b>Get out!</b>
<b>Good game.</b>
<b>Hey, Jeff, you okay?</b>
<b>-How was your game?</b>
<b>-l don't want to talk about it.</b>
<b>How are you?</b>
<b>You're covered with drool!</b>
<b>That's your dog.</b>
<b>What's wrong with Jeff?</b>
<b>He lost 32 points in his average.</b>
<b>ls that all?</b>
<b>So that puts him at .685 or something.</b>
<b>He's batting what?</b>
<b>Smells good in here. What you cooking?</b>
<b>Chicken.</b>
<b>Chicken and what?</b>
<b>Collard greens.</b>
<b>Good. l need a good meal tonight.</b>
<b>ls everything okay?</b>
<b>l stunk up the place.</b>
<b>Hope baseball was a good idea.</b>
<b>It was another career</b>
<b>day for Michael Jordan.</b>
<b>What're you watching?</b>
<b>He had 3 strikeouts.</b>
<b>ls this the only thing on TV?</b>
<b>What's up with this?</b>
<b>His batting average is .21 4,</b>
<b>which is his weight.</b>
<b>Get this guy a tennis racquet!</b>
<b>Did everyone get mad at you?</b>
<b>No. Worse.</b>
<b>They were nice about it.</b>
<b>I know golf is your sport.</b>
<b>But not here.</b>
<b>You should open your stance.</b>
<b>lt might make you more aggressive.</b>
<b>You think so? l'll remember that.</b>
<b>Watching this hurt me more than you.</b>
<b>Why are you watching this stuff?</b>
<b>lt's bad for you.</b>
<b>There.</b>
<b>Road Runner.</b>
<b>Stop this cartoon!</b>
<b>We've got an emergency Cartoon</b>
<b>Character Union Meeting to go to.</b>
<b>Hey, wait for me! Hold your horses!</b>
<b>Where'd they go?</b>
<b>Stop the music!</b>
<b>Top duck coming through!</b>
<b>Jeez! lt's getting so a guy can't</b>
<b>even get himself wet around here!</b>
<b>What's the big emergency?</b>
<b>These little guys would like to</b>
<b>make an announcement. Here.</b>
<b>You...</b>
<b>...all of you...</b>
<b>...are now our prisoners!</b>
<b>Oh, we're in big trouble now.</b>
<b>We are taking you to our</b>
<b>theme park in outer space.</b>
<b>No fooling.</b>
<b>You'll be our slaves.</b>
<b>And placed on display for the</b>
<b>amusement of our customers.</b>
<b>Oh, fear clutches my breast.</b>
<b>We ain't a-going...</b>
<b>...nowheres!</b>
<b>Not so fast, doc.</b>
<b>You just can't turn us into slaves.</b>
<b>That would be bad.</b>
<b>You must let us defend ourselves.</b>
<b>Oh, yeah? Who says?</b>
<b>Just a sec.</b>
<b>Read.</b>
<b>What's this?</b>
<b>''Give them a chance</b>
<b>to defend themselves.''</b>
<b>Do we have to?</b>
<b>lt's a rule.</b>
<b>Okay. lt is in the rule book.</b>
<b>Una momento!</b>
<b>We must confer.</b>
<b>All right, troops. lt is for us to</b>
<b>choose a battlefield that affords us--</b>
<b>l got it.</b>
<b>Yes, Private Porkster?</b>
<b>How about we challenge them to a...</b>
<b>...spelling bee?</b>
<b>Say...</b>
<b>...we could have a bowling tournament.</b>
<b>Suffering succotash!</b>
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>
<b>Let's get a ladder...</b>
<b>...wait till the old lady's gone...</b>
<b>...and grab that little bird!</b>
<b>Whoa! Take a deep breath, Sly!</b>
<b>Okay, let's analyze the competition.</b>
<b>Now what are we looking at here?</b>
<b>We got a small race of invading aliens....</b>
<b>Small arms! Short legs!</b>
<b>Not very fast.</b>
<b>Tiny little guys.</b>
<b>Can't jump high.</b>
<b>We challenge you to a basketball game.</b>
<b>Basketball it is!</b>
<b>Basketball!</b>
<b>What is basketball?</b>
<b>-What's that?</b>
<b>-Beats me.</b>
<b>We didn't have that in school.</b>
<b>Lights!</b>
<b>Pardon me! Sorry.</b>
<b>Down in front!</b>
<b>An exhilarating team sport currently</b>
<b>growing rapidly in popularity...</b>
<b>...is basketball.</b>
<b>Unlike football and baseball,</b>
<b>only 5 men can play on a team.</b>
<b>It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle</b>
<b>game that requires quick wits...</b>
<b>...and even faster reflexes.</b>
<b>Here's how it's done professionally.</b>
<b>The National Basketball Association...</b>
<b>...featuring the best players in the world.</b>
<b>The best players in the world!</b>
<b>The best!</b>
<b>Excuse me. Oh, so sorry.</b>
<b>Excuse me.</b>
<b>Get off my nose!</b>
<b>Quiet, they're looking!</b>
<b>lt's basketball!</b>
<b>Where?</b>
<b>Whoa! Now what?</b>
<b>-She's looking.</b>
<b>-Close it up.</b>
<b>Tightly.</b>
<b>You poked me again.</b>
<b>Sweetheart?</b>
<b>l thought you'd get better seats.</b>
<b>-This is the best l could get.</b>
<b>-This guy's doing something weird.</b>
<b>Just let me watch the game.</b>
<b>Barkley is killing us.</b>
<b>Someone's killing someone!</b>
<b>No. Seriously?</b>
<b>A killer!</b>
<b>Let me see!</b>
<b>There! That's the killer!</b>
<b>He's big.</b>
<b>He's good.</b>
<b>He's mine!</b>
<b>Go get him!</b>
<b>Come on! Get back on defense!</b>
<b>Let's go! Get back on d!</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>Time out! Call time out!</b>
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>
<b>Let him in.</b>
<b>Open up!</b>
<b>Open!</b>
<b>He did it.</b>
<b>l got it! l got his talent!</b>
<b>Super.</b>
<b>-Sit down, Chuck.</b>
<b>-Man, l'm fine! l am fine!</b>
<b>l played you too much.</b>
<b>-l'm not tired!</b>
<b>-Get the doctor.</b>
<b>You all right?</b>
<b>You sure?</b>
<b>Come on, we're okay.</b>
<b>Come on, let's go.</b>
<b>Come on, Patrick. Showtime!</b>
<b>What's wrong with him?</b>
<b>In a shocking development, 5 NBA</b>
<b>players were put on the disabled list...</b>
<b>...in the last 24 hours, all suffering</b>
<b>from the same mysterious ailment...</b>
<b>...that affects the player's coordination.</b>
<b>l'll be home in a few days.</b>
<b>Put your mom on.</b>
<b>How you doing?</b>
<b>Watching TV?</b>
<b>What's going on?</b>
<b>-You gonna be all right?</b>
<b>-I'm ready, Coach.</b>
<b>Looks like l retired just in time.</b>
<b>l must go.</b>
<b>l'll call you later. Love you, bye.</b>
<b>lt's open!</b>
<b>lt's game time!</b>
<b>Lace up your Nikes.</b>
<b>Grab your Gatorade and we'll</b>
<b>get a Big Mac on the way.</b>
<b>Now we go to the Los Angeles Forum...</b>
<b>...where the Lakers are</b>
<b>refusing to take the court.</b>
<b>Get dressed.</b>
<b>We got a game in 5 minutes!</b>
<b>We're talking a huge fine.</b>
<b>We can't go in the locker room.</b>
<b>You heard what happened to</b>
<b>Barkley and Ewing. There's germs.</b>
<b>Cedric, that was in New York,</b>
<b>3,000 miles away.</b>
<b>Bacteria travels faster</b>
<b>than the speed of light.</b>
<b>Like ''lnvasion of the Body Snatchers.''</b>
<b>All right.</b>
<b>Dress in the hallway.</b>
<b>Okay, okay, which one of you</b>
<b>maroons has ever played basketball?</b>
<b>l have, Coach.</b>
<b>And there's an important question</b>
<b>l must ask you.</b>
<b>What do you think?</b>
<b>l'm partial to purple and gold.</b>
<b>lt's better with my coloring.</b>
<b>Nice outfit, Daffy.</b>
<b>The little aliens say it's</b>
<b>their turn to use the court.</b>
<b>Sure, let the little pipsqueaks</b>
<b>knock themselves out.</b>
<b>Too bad you can't practice</b>
<b>getting taller, boys.</b>
<b>Hey, little pig!</b>
<b>l wet myself.</b>
<b>Time to play a little basketball.</b>
<b>These little pipsqueaks just</b>
<b>turned into superstars!</b>
<b>They're monsters!</b>
<b>Suffering succotash!</b>
<b>They're ''monstars''!</b>
<b>Bye-bye.</b>
<b>l think we might need some help.</b>
<b>1 7 5 yards.</b>
<b>Okay, little fella. You my friend?</b>
<b>Or my enemy?</b>
<b>You are my friend. You are my ally.</b>
<b>You are my associate,</b>
<b>my personal assistant.</b>
<b>You are my weapon. You are leaving.</b>
<b>-Great shot.</b>
<b>-Nice shot.</b>
<b>You can stop posing now.</b>
<b>Good try.</b>
<b>Not bad.</b>
<b>-Something for you to shoot at.</b>
<b>-Hit it good.</b>
<b>Do my best.</b>
<b>Good shot.</b>
<b>l know.</b>
<b>l must ask you something.</b>
<b>The NBA must face reality.</b>
<b>What's happening is serious.</b>
<b>They're going to need</b>
<b>new players with talent.</b>
<b>Skilled guys who never really</b>
<b>thought about a professional career.</b>
<b>Think l got a shot?</b>
<b>Come on, really?</b>
<b>Don't kid.</b>
<b>lt's a man's game.</b>
<b>-You can't play.</b>
<b>-What if l tried hard?</b>
<b>Keep it down.</b>
<b>lt's because l'm white.</b>
<b>No. Larry's white. So what?</b>
<b>Larry's not white. Larry's clear.</b>
<b>Get inside his ball!</b>
<b>You clowns can't beat that.</b>
<b>-My best shot ever.</b>
<b>-You haven't played long.</b>
<b>A Hall-of-Fame shot.</b>
<b>-Nice shot, Mr. Bird.</b>
<b>-Larry, please.</b>
<b>Nice shot, Mr. Larry.</b>
<b>Nice shot.</b>
<b>You can do this.</b>
<b>Don't be nervous, you can do this.</b>
<b>You feel the NBA has to face reality,</b>
<b>don't you?</b>
<b>Look for some players where</b>
<b>they never looked before.</b>
<b>Just look at the ball.</b>
<b>Visualize where you want it to go.</b>
<b>Be the ball.</b>
<b>Get off the tee.</b>
<b>Can't jump.</b>
<b>Go on.</b>
<b>Close to the pin?</b>
<b>For dinner?</b>
<b>-Sounds good.</b>
<b>-l'll go close to the pin.</b>
<b>l'll have some.</b>
<b>Not bad.</b>
<b>Good shot.</b>
<b>Get down.</b>
<b>Look at that spin.</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>lt is alive!</b>
<b>My first hole in one.</b>
<b>Never seen one of these.</b>
<b>Nothing but the bottom of the cup.</b>
<b>-That's his ball too.</b>
<b>-Yeah, it's my ball.</b>
<b>Wait, let me get a picture!</b>
<b>You must smile.</b>
<b>Reach in for the ball and then smile, okay?</b>
<b>ls this good?</b>
<b>Just take the picture!</b>
<b>What kind of camera is that?</b>
<b>Don't point it at me.</b>
<b>-l didn't do anything!</b>
<b>-Where'd he go?</b>
<b>Look out for that first step,</b>
<b>doc, it's a real lulu.</b>
<b>Bugs Bunny?</b>
<b>You expected the Easter Bunny?</b>
<b>You're not real.</b>
<b>Not real? lf l weren't real, could l do this?</b>
<b>ls that Michael?</b>
<b>lt's Michael!</b>
<b>lt's Air Jordan.</b>
<b>Basketball!</b>
<b>l thought l saw....</b>
<b>l did. l did see Michael Jordan.</b>
<b>Pardon me, Mr. Jordan.</b>
<b>Can l have your auto--</b>
<b>Your John Hancock, please?</b>
<b>Let the doctor take a look.</b>
<b>A little high.</b>
<b>Going down!</b>
<b>So, what do you say we go for a little spin?</b>
<b>Let's see what we got inside here.</b>
<b>Say, ''Ahh.''</b>
<b>All right. He's okay!</b>
<b>What's going on here?</b>
<b>l thought you'd never ask.</b>
<b>These aliens from outer space want to</b>
<b>make us slaves in their theme park.</b>
<b>They're little. So we challenged</b>
<b>them to a basketball game.</b>
<b>Then, they ain't so little!</b>
<b>They're huge! We need to beat these guys.</b>
<b>They're talking about slavery!</b>
<b>They'll make us do stand-up,</b>
<b>the same jokes every night!</b>
<b>We'll be locked up like wild animals,</b>
<b>trotted out to perform...</b>
<b>...for a bunch of bug-eyed, fat-headed,</b>
<b>humor-challenged aliens!</b>
<b>What l'm trying to say is...</b>
<b>...we need your help!</b>
<b>l'm a baseball player now.</b>
<b>Right. And l'm a Shakespearean actor.</b>
<b>Mike?</b>
<b>Michael? lt's Stan.</b>
<b>Stan Podolak.</b>
<b>l need you to come out now, okay?</b>
<b>You got a baseball game tomorrow.</b>
<b>And I'd look pretty stupid</b>
<b>if you don't show up.</b>
<b>Think he's all right? l hate to leave him.</b>
<b>He's fine. l think he just had to</b>
<b>get away from that Stan character.</b>
<b>He's pathetic, isn't he?</b>
<b>l'll give us both twos. We weren't in</b>
<b>any kind of emotional state to putt.</b>
<b>l think that's fair.</b>
<b>lf Mike is gone, the NBA is</b>
<b>going to need some new people.</b>
<b>There's room at the top.</b>
<b>An exciting guy</b>
<b>who could even perform at half-time.</b>
<b>You know David Stern?</b>
<b>A phone call from you....</b>
<b>l want to help...</b>
<b>...but l haven't played in a long time.</b>
<b>My timing's off.</b>
<b>We'll fix it.</b>
<b>Look at our facility.</b>
<b>We got hoops.</b>
<b>We got weights.</b>
<b>We've got balls.</b>
<b>You sure do. This place is a mess.</b>
<b>You're worried about a mess?</b>
<b>There's nothing here a little</b>
<b>spit shine wouldn't fix.</b>
<b>Spit shine!</b>
<b>Lemony-fresh.</b>
<b>You guys are nuts.</b>
<b>Correction: We're Looney Tunes.</b>
<b>And as such are the exclusive property</b>
<b>and trademark of Warner Bros. lnc.</b>
<b>l'm here!</b>
<b>Me too!</b>
<b>That hurt.</b>
<b>Who are they?</b>
<b>Remember the tiny aliens l told you about?</b>
<b>You've heard of the Dream Team?</b>
<b>We're the Mean Team, wussieman!</b>
<b>Wussieman.</b>
<b>We're the Monstars.</b>
<b>M-o-n-....</b>
<b>Let's see what you got...</b>
<b>...chump!</b>
<b>l don't play basketball anymore.</b>
<b>''l don't play basketball anymore.''</b>
<b>Maybe you're chicken.</b>
<b>l say, l resemble that remark.</b>
<b>You calling me chicken?</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>Here you go. Take him!</b>
<b>Watch the footwork.</b>
<b>Can you believe it?</b>
<b>Get out of the way!</b>
<b>Everybody.</b>
<b>Look at your hero now.</b>
<b>You guys are making a mistake.</b>
<b>You're all washed up, baldy!</b>
<b>Baldy?</b>
<b>He is not washed up!</b>
<b>-Michael's the greatest!</b>
<b>-Shut up!</b>
<b>My poor little cranium.</b>
<b>You okay?</b>
<b>Yeah, are you okay?</b>
<b>Whoops!</b>
<b>You're not scared of them...</b>
<b>...are you?</b>
<b>Let's play some basketball.</b>
<b>You're...!</b>
<b>You're Charles Barkley.</b>
<b>Girls! Come on over! Hurry up! Hurry!</b>
<b>Look! lt's Charles Barkley!</b>
<b>Can l play?</b>
<b>You're not Charles Barkley.</b>
<b>Just a wanna-be who looks like him.</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>Break out.</b>
<b>You shouldn't even be here! Be gone!</b>
<b>Wanna-be! Be gone!</b>
<b>Just a few more tests.</b>
<b>Electrolyte levels,</b>
<b>glucose, CBCs, RBCs, etc.</b>
<b>And we've scheduled a stress test...</b>
<b>...and neurological battery</b>
<b>to include EEG and....</b>
<b>And this girl...</b>
<b>...five feet nothing, blocked my shot.</b>
<b>When did you first have this dream?</b>
<b>lt wasn't a dream! lt really happened!</b>
<b>lt climbed up my back...</b>
<b>...and into my brain.</b>
<b>Are there other areas...</b>
<b>...besides basketball...</b>
<b>...where you find yourself...</b>
<b>...unable to perform?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Just asking.</b>
<b>l've been MRl'd, EKG'd,</b>
<b>x-rayed, laser beamed....</b>
<b>l'll never swear again.</b>
<b>l'll never get another technical.</b>
<b>l'll never trash-talk.</b>
<b>l've got other skills.</b>
<b>l could go work on the farm.</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>Or maybe l could go back to</b>
<b>the jungle and be a missionary.</b>
<b>What are you saying?</b>
<b>That l'm trying to disobey my mama?</b>
<b>You said that, not me.</b>
<b>l love her.</b>
<b>Still can't find anything wrong!</b>
<b>Maybe nothing's wrong!</b>
<b>Maybe it's just in our head.</b>
<b>We're fine. lt's psychosomatic.</b>
<b>Or has to do with the moon.</b>
<b>l'll never date Madonna again.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>l'm fixing a divot.</b>
<b>He's fixing a divot!</b>
<b>Has anyone here ever played basketball?</b>
<b>l have.</b>
<b>l'd like to try out.</b>
<b>Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.</b>
<b>Lola?</b>
<b>Hello!</b>
<b>My name's Bugs.</b>
<b>You want to play one-on-one, doll?</b>
<b>''Doll''?</b>
<b>On the court, Bugs.</b>
<b>She's hot!</b>
<b>Ready?</b>
<b>l got it! l got it!</b>
<b>That girl's got some skills.</b>
<b>Don't ever call me...</b>
<b>...''doll.''</b>
<b>Check!</b>
<b>Nice playing with you.</b>
<b>Very smooth.</b>
<b>She's obviously nuts about me.</b>
<b>Obviously.</b>
<b>Mais oui.</b>
<b>Where's the ball?</b>
<b>Let's do some drills.</b>
<b>Can anyone lend me some sneakers?</b>
<b>Sneakers?</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>Someone must get my gear</b>
<b>from my house.</b>
<b>Your house?</b>
<b>ln 3-D land?</b>
<b>Whatever you do...</b>
<b>...remember my North Carolina shorts.</b>
<b>Your shorts? From college?</b>
<b>l wore them under my Chicago Bulls</b>
<b>uniform every game.</b>
<b>l washed them after every game!</b>
<b>l did!</b>
<b>The view back here stinks.</b>
<b>We're in front of his house.</b>
<b>l knew that!</b>
<b>Let's go in this way.</b>
<b>l say, let's go in that way!</b>
<b>He just never learns!</b>
<b>Let me see.</b>
<b>l must be very, very...</b>
<b>...close.</b>
<b>Mother!</b>
<b>Nice digs.</b>
<b>Well, well. l wonder who that could be.</b>
<b>Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</b>
<b>Everyone's sleeping!</b>
<b>l knew that.</b>
<b>Come on, we must find</b>
<b>Michael's basketball stuff.</b>
<b>Nope. Nothing in here.</b>
<b>Nope.</b>
<b>But a very nice dinette set.</b>
<b>Not here.</b>
<b>Let's look upstairs.</b>
<b>Yes, Oh, Fearless Leader.</b>
<b>So, he needs his special underwear.</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>You think she's got enough toys?</b>
<b>Speaking of toys,</b>
<b>you know all those mugs and...</b>
<b>...lunch boxes with our pictures on them?</b>
<b>You ever see any money from it?</b>
<b>-Not a cent.</b>
<b>-Me neither.</b>
<b>lt's a shame.</b>
<b>We need a new agent.</b>
<b>We're getting screwed.</b>
<b>We've found the trophy room.</b>
<b>Spread out and search the place.</b>
<b>Yes, sahib.</b>
<b>Oh, brother.</b>
<b>Here l am, in the peak of my form...</b>
<b>...playing second banana to</b>
<b>some sort of harebrain....</b>
<b>This could be useful.</b>
<b>lf this were a union job....</b>
<b>That's very nice.</b>
<b>-l could use this.</b>
<b>-One of his shoes.</b>
<b>Where is the other shoe?</b>
<b>Where are you?</b>
<b>Eureka!</b>
<b>Come to Papa.</b>
<b>What a fuzz-foot. You are so clumsy.</b>
<b>Catch.</b>
<b>Thanks.</b>
<b>Time to go.</b>
<b>Did we get everything?</b>
<b>The shorts!</b>
<b>ln there?</b>
<b>Okay, l'll check.</b>
<b>l found the shorts.</b>
<b>The pain!</b>
<b>l'm right behind you.</b>

<b>Nice puppy.</b>
<b>Want a bone?</b>

<b>How about a nice ham?</b>
<b>Can't we talk this over?</b>
<b>Down, Beethoven.</b>
<b>The kids are here.</b>
<b>Give it.</b>
<b>Here.</b>
<b>Thanks, kid.</b>
<b>Bad dog!</b>
<b>That is the last time l'm ever</b>

<b>Where you going?</b>
<b>You see, the Looney Tunes have a</b>
<b>big basketball game coming up and...</b>
<b>-...your dad's playing.</b>
<b>-All right!</b>
<b>Yeah! But don't tell anybody!</b>
<b>l see aliens.</b>
<b>Little aliens from outer space.</b>
<b>They forced their way inside your bodies.</b>
<b>They need your talent to win a...</b>
<b>...basketball game against...</b>
<b>...Bugs Bunny.</b>
<b>l also see Michael Jordan...</b>
<b>...being sucked down a golf hole...</b>
<b>...by furry creatures.</b>
<b>That's it. We're going.</b>
<b>We're leaving.</b>
<b>Let's try acupuncture.</b>
<b>Good idea.</b>
<b>This is it! This is it!</b>
<b>l don't know where you are...</b>
<b>...but you obviously enjoy being</b>
<b>there more than being with me!</b>
<b>You better hope this Jordan</b>
<b>character still can play.</b>
<b>You and me both, brother.</b>
<b>Listen, how is this for a new team name:</b>
<b>The Ducks.</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>What kind of Mickey Mouse</b>
<b>organization would name a team that?</b>
<b>So sue me. lt's just a suggestion.</b>
<b>You're doing it!</b>
<b>You're becoming mighty!</b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>No pain, no gain.</b>
<b>Guys?</b>
<b>Look who's finally ready to play!</b>
<b>Let's see if l remember how.</b>
<b>ls it really you?</b>
<b>Thank God you're all right!</b>
<b>l was so worried!</b>
<b>Come on, Stan. Don't hug me, please.</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>-Why are you here?</b>
<b>-l must take you back for practice.</b>
<b>l can't. l'm helping my friends</b>
<b>in their basketball game.</b>
<b>Your friends are cartoon characters.</b>
<b>Yeah. So?</b>
<b>lt doesn't bother me.</b>
<b>Let me help? Let me help! l can help!</b>
<b>What can you do?</b>
<b>l may not be tall, but...</b>
<b>...l'm slow.</b>
<b>And large.</b>
<b>And a dork!</b>
<b>l'll do anything! Anything!</b>
<b>Anything?</b>
<b>Anything.</b>
<b>Come here. Come here for a second.</b>
<b>Sit right here.</b>
<b>No problem.</b>
<b>All right! All right, let's go, team!</b>
<b>lf someone gets injured,</b>
<b>we could see a lot of minutes.</b>
<b>l'm a cheerleader.</b>
<b>Mr. Commissioner, the place is sealed off.</b>
<b>Quiet!</b>
<b>Listen. After meeting with team owners...</b>
<b>...l decided that until we can guarantee...</b>
<b>...the health of our players...</b>
<b>...there will be no more</b>
<b>basketball this season.</b>
<b>Just get out of my way.</b>
<b>Ready?</b>
<b>Let's go!</b>
<b>Are these the best seats?</b>
<b>Like them!</b>
<b>Can see everything from here! Very good!</b>
<b>Ready to go?</b>
<b>Yeah, sure.</b>
<b>Riot!</b>
<b>Ladies and gentlemen...</b>
<b>...the starting lineup for...</b>
<b>...the Tune Squad!</b>
<b>Standing 2 foot 4...</b>
<b>...The Wonder From Down Under...</b>
<b>...the Tazmanian Devil!</b>
<b>At small forward...</b>
<b>...standing a scintillating 3 foot 2...</b>
<b>...The Heartthrob of the Hoops...</b>
<b>...Lola Bunny!</b>
<b>At power forward...</b>
<b>...The Quackster of the Courts: Daffy Duck!</b>
<b>Thank you! Thank you!</b>
<b>Very funny.</b>
<b>Let's all laugh at the duck.</b>
<b>And at point guard...</b>
<b>...standing 3 foot 3,</b>
<b>4 feet if you include the ears...</b>

<b>...The Doctor of Delight:</b>

<b>...His Royal Airness:</b>
<b>Michael Jordan!</b>
<b>Who?</b>

<b>Perhaps.</b>

<b>l'll take it to the rack.</b>
<b>They'll wish they never were born!</b>
<b>Guys, let's just go out and have fun.</b>
<b>The challengers for the Ultimate Game...</b>
<b>...all the way from Moron Mountain:</b>
<b>The Monstars!</b>
<b>Go Monstars! Go Monstars!</b>
<b>Go Monstars!</b>
<b>What are you looking at?</b>
<b>Cool shoes.</b>
<b>Ready?</b>
<b>l got it! l got the ball!</b>
<b>Way to go!</b>
<b>Did you see the moves on that one?</b>
<b>Come on. Show me something!</b>
<b>The duck!</b>
<b>Oh, my!</b>
<b>She was wide open.</b>
<b>Watch the screen!</b>
<b>Watch out!</b>
<b>Get him!</b>
<b>How did he do that?</b>
<b>Nice shot, Mr. J.</b>
<b>Let's play defense.</b>
<b>Way to go!</b>
<b>Air J!</b>
<b>Red light!</b>
<b>Feed me!</b>
<b>Feed you?</b>
<b>Feed me!</b>
<b>-Bad old putty tat!</b>
<b>-l'll take that.</b>
<b>Don't try this at home!</b>
<b>''l wish l was in the land of--''</b>
<b>Going somewhere?</b>
<b>May l remind you, sir...</b>
<b>...that physical violence is</b>
<b>patently against the rules!</b>
<b>Did you order Original Recipe</b>
<b>or Extra Crispy?</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>Me?</b>
<b>l'm ready. l can do this.</b>
<b>You picked the mouse?</b>
<b>l love basketball. l always have. Do you?</b>
<b>l bet you're good.</b>
<b>l'm small, but l try hard to be good.</b>
<b>l always try hard.</b>
<b>My mom says, ''Try your best--''</b>
<b>Try to get by me, doll.</b>
<b>''Doll''?</b>
<b>Don't ever call me...</b>
<b>...''doll.''</b>
<b>Nice shot.</b>
<b>There's the defense boy. l got you.</b>
<b>91 1 !</b>
<b>Pie? Pork chop?</b>
<b>Sorbet, perhaps?</b>
<b>Half-time.</b>
<b>Holy Putty Tat!</b>
<b>We're better than them.</b>
<b>We got them.</b>
<b>Moron Mountain, here we come.</b>
<b>We're going to be slaves.</b>
<b>There's a whole other half to play.</b>
<b>lt's the boss.</b>
<b>Hello, Mr. Swackhammer!</b>
<b>All right.</b>
<b>Not bad for the first half.</b>
<b>But we must keep this up.</b>
<b>No problem.</b>
<b>We stole talent from the NBA players!</b>
<b>From the NBA!</b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>l smell something.</b>
<b>We've been playing hard.</b>
<b>Not you, you idiot!</b>
<b>lt's coming from over here.</b>
<b>That locker.</b>
<b>Look!</b>
<b>lt's the chubby boy!</b>
<b>lt smells like a...</b>
<b>...spy!</b>
<b>You guys need a publicist?</b>
<b>l can make you big.</b>
<b>-l know we're down.</b>
<b>-Let's hear the story.</b>
<b>l've been here before.</b>
<b>We can still win this.</b>
<b>lt's not over. We must come together.</b>
<b>We must believe in ourselves.</b>
<b>That'll help us.</b>
<b>Looks like Stan had a close</b>
<b>encounter with a bug-zapper.</b>
<b>The Monstars!</b>
<b>The Monstars!</b>
<b>That must hurt.</b>
<b>The Monstars!</b>
<b>The Monstars...</b>
<b>...stole the talent from the NBA players.</b>
<b>So that's what happened to them.</b>
<b>l think we should qui-- qui-- forfeit.</b>
<b>Listen, l didn't get dragged down</b>
<b>here to lose to ugly Monstars.</b>
<b>l ain't going out like that.</b>
<b>We're letting them push us!</b>
<b>We must fight back!</b>
<b>We must get right in their faces!</b>
<b>Well?</b>
<b>Are you with me or not?</b>
<b>Finished? Great speech and all.</b>
<b>You had them riveted.</b>
<b>But didn't you forget something?</b>
<b>Your secret stuff!</b>
<b>Nice deltoids!</b>
<b>Play along.</b>
<b>Stop hogging it.</b>
<b>We're teammates!</b>
<b>Secret stuff?</b>
<b>Secret stuff? You wouldn't</b>
<b>hold out on us, would you?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>l didn't think you needed it.</b>
<b>You're so tough. You're competitive.</b>
<b>We're also chicken. We need it bad.</b>
<b>-l'd like some of that.</b>
<b>-Could l have a sip, please?</b>
<b>This goes against everything</b>
<b>l learned in health class.</b>
<b>Do you want to win?</b>
<b>Bottoms up.</b>
<b>Yummy.</b>
<b>How about we go out</b>
<b>and kick some alien butt?</b>
<b>How about it? Ready?</b>
<b>Open!</b>
<b>Coming through!</b>
<b>Special delivery!</b>
<b>Nice kaboom.</b>
<b>Let's teach them a lesson.</b>
<b>Nice butt!</b>
<b>Going up!</b>
<b>Slammy!</b>
<b>Hello! A little surprise for you, my friends.</b>
<b>2 points.</b>
<b>This will be good.</b>
<b>Okay, birdie!</b>
<b>Time out!</b>
<b>Shut up, get away from me. Powwow!</b>
<b>We're right back in this game.</b>
<b>Let's play tough defense.</b>
<b>Why didn't you get him?</b>
<b>He's a baseball player.</b>
<b>A baseball player.</b>
<b>Looks like a basketball player to me.</b>
<b>Me too.</b>
<b>He's the one l want for Moron Mountain.</b>
<b>Are you talking to me?</b>
<b>Yeah, l am. You want a piece of me?</b>
<b>Come and get it!</b>
<b>What do you have in mind?</b>
<b>What about we raise the stakes?</b>
<b>lnteresting.</b>
<b>lf we win, you give the NBA</b>
<b>players their talent back.</b>
<b>But what if we win?</b>
<b>lf you win?</b>
<b>You get me.</b>
<b>Good deal.</b>
<b>Doc, you think that's a good idea?</b>
<b>You'll be our star attraction.</b>
<b>You'll sign autographs all day long.</b>
<b>And play one-on-one with</b>
<b>the paying customers.</b>
<b>And lose.</b>
<b>Do we have a deal?</b>
<b>Deal.</b>
<b>l don't think you should do this.</b>
<b>l have faith in my team.</b>
<b>Crush them!</b>
<b>Defeating time, boys.</b>
<b>Good-bye!</b>
<b>Fore!</b>
<b>But, Mommy,</b>
<b>l don't want to go to school today.</b>
<b>l want to stay home</b>
<b>and bake cookies with you.</b>
<b>l'm open!</b>
<b>Heads up!</b>
<b>Belly flop!</b>
<b>Oh, my!</b>
<b>ls this your man?</b>
<b>You okay?</b>
<b>Me? Oh, yeah. l'm fine.</b>
<b>Are you okay?</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>lt was nothing.</b>
<b>That was the nicest thing</b>
<b>anyone's ever done for me.</b>
<b>Time out.</b>
<b>l could have been a contender!</b>
<b>The Monstars! The Monstars!</b>
<b>l could have had a V-8!</b>
<b>We need a fifth player.</b>
<b>You got any more secret stuff?</b>
<b>l think it's starting to wear off.</b>
<b>lt didn't wear off. lt was water.</b>
<b>You guys had the ''special stuff''</b>
<b>inside you all along.</b>
<b>Yeah, l knew that. But you got any more?</b>
<b>Can l have some?</b>
<b>-Stan?</b>
<b>-Me?</b>
<b>You're center.</b>
<b>Just guard the big guy.</b>
<b>Guard him? l'll smother him!</b>
<b>l'll be all over him like a cheap suit!</b>
<b>l'll be on him like stink on rice!</b>
<b>He's going down!</b>
<b>Over here!</b>
<b>Over here!</b>
<b>l'm open!</b>
<b>Nice shot!</b>
<b>Big man, ain't he?</b>
<b>Let's get him out of here!</b>
<b>Oh, my!</b>
<b>How'd he do that?</b>
<b>Anyone can do that.</b>
<b>Even you.</b>
<b>Watch this.</b>
<b>No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land.</b>
<b>10 seconds to go?</b>
<b>Thanks for telling me, doc.</b>
<b>l hate to be the bearer of bad news,</b>
<b>Your Airness...</b>
<b>...but if you don't find a fifth player,</b>
<b>your team will forfeit the game.</b>
<b>Forfeit?</b>
<b>Precisely, Sir Altitude.</b>
<b>No way. We'll find someone.</b>
<b>l didn't know Dan Ackroyd</b>
<b>was in this picture!</b>
<b>Perhaps l could be of some assistance?</b>
<b>That's our fifth guy.</b>
<b>Now you get to live your dream. Let's go.</b>
<b>-We need to score 2 points.</b>
<b>-Here's how l see it.</b>
<b>You kick it to the girl</b>
<b>bunny down in the post.</b>
<b>You dish it to Bugs.</b>
<b>You swing it to Mike. You go to the hole.</b>
<b>-And dominate!</b>
<b>-We're on defense!</b>
<b>l don't play defense.</b>
<b>Typical.</b>
<b>You must listen to Mike on this.</b>
<b>Someone steal the ball,</b>
<b>get it to me and l'll score.</b>
<b>Don't lose that confidence!</b>
<b>Paws and wings in here! Okay!</b>
<b>This is why l was born.</b>
<b>l thrive on pressure.</b>
<b>Excuse me, sorry.</b>
<b>Easy on the trousers, Daf.</b>
<b>Pardon me. Mr. Murray,</b>
<b>something's really been bugging me.</b>
<b>Just how did you get here?</b>
<b>Producer's a friend of mine.</b>
<b>Had a teamster drop me off.</b>
<b>That's how it goes.</b>
<b>You see this chunky fellow?</b>
<b>That's good!</b>
<b>Let's do it!</b>
<b>Play fair.</b>
<b>Don't choke now. Come on.</b>
<b>lt's gut-check time!</b>
<b>This must be mine.</b>
<b>l'm going this way! l'm going left!</b>
<b>Never trust an Earthling!</b>
<b>Get the girl!</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>l'm open!</b>
<b>-That's mine!</b>
<b>-Not today!</b>
<b>Bring it on, dude.</b>
<b>You're mine!</b>
<b>l'm open!</b>
<b>Never mind.</b>
<b>The Tunes win!</b>
<b>Nice pass.</b>
<b>Great stretch at the basket too.</b>
<b>You really got some skills.</b>
<b>You could play in the NBA.</b>
<b>Thanks, Mike.</b>
<b>l'll probably quote you on that.</b>
<b>But l'm going to take this opportunity</b>
<b>to retire from the game.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>No,</b>
<b>l'm going to retire right now and that's it.</b>
<b>l'm going to go out undefeated.</b>
<b>That's how it will be.</b>
<b>-You go celebrate.</b>
<b>-Come with us.</b>
<b>l'd like to, but l have to ice down my</b>
<b>knees now. They're starting to go.</b>
<b>Good-bye.</b>
<b>See you.</b>
<b>You sure?</b>
<b>Yes. Definitely sure. Definitely.</b>
<b>-Losers!</b>
<b>-Sorry.</b>
<b>-Choke artists!</b>
<b>-Sorry again.</b>
<b>Wait till l get you back</b>
<b>on Moron Mountain.</b>
<b>The party's over! Get in the spaceship.</b>
<b>Why do you take that?</b>
<b>Because he's bigger.</b>
<b>He's bigger?</b>
<b>Than we used...</b>
<b>...to be.</b>
<b>What're you doing?</b>
<b>-Wait! What are you doing? Wait!</b>
<b>-Come here.</b>
<b>Had it in you all the time.</b>
<b>One thing. Pass me the ball, Bugs.</b>
<b>Give my friends their talent back.</b>
<b>Do we have to?</b>
<b>lt's part of the deal. Touch the ball.</b>
<b>Fair is fair.</b>
<b>Touch it.</b>
<b>That was so much fun.</b>
<b>l feel so...</b>
<b>...insignificant.</b>
<b>My clothes don't fit.</b>
<b>What a trip!</b>
<b>l'm up for another!</b>
<b>Can we ask you a favor, Mr. Bunny?</b>
<b>We don't want to go back.</b>
<b>-We hate it there.</b>
<b>-lt stinks.</b>
<b>l was thinking, could we stay here?</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>Oh, brother.</b>
<b>l don't know if you guys</b>
<b>are looney enough.</b>
<b>Looney enough?</b>
<b>Do you know what time it is?</b>
<b>Seven-fift-- Seven-fift--</b>
<b>Quarter past seven.</b>
<b>You have a baseball game in 5 minutes!</b>
<b>Okay. Take this.</b>
<b>ls it safe?</b>
<b>Yeah, put it in my bag.</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>l enjoyed playing with you.</b>
<b>You've got a lot of....</b>
<b>Whatever it is, you got a lot of it.</b>
<b>Got to go.</b>
<b>Stay out of trouble.</b>
<b>You know l will.</b>
<b>Come here!</b>
<b>The delay is killing us.</b>
<b>Where's Michael?</b>
<b>Where is Michael?</b>
<b>He's not back from his other game.</b>
<b>What game?</b>
<b>What other game?</b>
<b>Ladies and gentlemen...</b>
<b>...Michael Jordan!</b>
<b>Guys...</b>
<b>...we suck!</b>
<b>My grandmother plays better.</b>
<b>You guys are still tall.</b>
<b>l'm nothing now. Just a short guy.</b>
<b>You're right.</b>
<b>That's the only thing you got right.</b>
<b>-Who's that?</b>
<b>-Who is it?</b>
<b>l don't know.</b>
<b>You've been getting beaten.</b>
<b>lt's Mike.</b>
<b>-What's up?</b>
<b>-Why're you here?</b>
<b>Don't be embarrassed.</b>
<b>Just face it.</b>
<b>You stink.</b>
<b>Lighten up.</b>
<b>l know.</b>
<b>You want your games back.</b>
<b>What games you had.</b>
<b>lt's hard enough as it is.</b>
<b>Give us a break.</b>
<b>l'm going to regret this.</b>
<b>Give me the ball.</b>
<b>lt's like ''Star Trek.''</b>
<b>Touch it.</b>
<b>No way, Jose.</b>
<b>You want your talent back? Just touch it.</b>
<b>-l don't know.</b>
<b>-Don't touch it.</b>
<b>You'll walk around with a bad game</b>
<b>for the rest of your career. Touch it.</b>
<b>Careful, Pat.</b>
<b>We've tried everything else.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Touch it.</b>
<b>The rest of you.</b>
<b>Just touch it.</b>
<b>-What was that?</b>
<b>-l liked that.</b>
<b>l caught it!</b>
<b>Look at Mugsey handle the rock!</b>

<b>That felt good!</b>
<b>-l got it.</b>
<b>-You got it. Yeah, baby.</b>
<b>Stay.</b>
<b>Play some 3-on-3 with us?</b>
<b>l don't think so.</b>
<b>You going to work on your swing?</b>
<b>Leave the baseball player alone.</b>
<b>He doesn't play basketball now.</b>
<b>He probably doesn't have it anymore.</b>
<b>Do you hear them?</b>
<b>They don't think you can play the game.</b>
<b>There's one way to find out.</b>
<b>The Chicago Bulls is</b>

<b>...Michael Jordan!</b>
<b>What's the matter?</b>
<b>Larry could have been me.</b>
<b>Will you get off that kick? lt's over.</b>

<b>Space Jam</b>
<b>You've never seen anything like it.</b>
Every hellspawn all the way back to the primordial past has lost their struggle with the darkness.
Don't give into the demons.
You hear me, soldier?
Don't let the demons take you.
When you pulled that trigger, you made Hell take notice.
Spawn was born on that day.
We were partners, Jess.
From the day we met, my job was to whack you.
- Who gave the order?
- It was Wynn!
I killed him!
Confessions of a fruitcake... probably nothing.
Check the alleys for another body anyway.
Detectives Burke and Williams,
I'm Lisa Wu, "Washington Post."
You're investigating murders committed in the alleys off 42nd Street.
No comment, lady.
Have you found the guns used in the murders?
Get away from me!
A hellspawn can be free of the curse.
How can you know that?
Because I am free.
No!
We've all seen faces that make us turn our heads... people with scars or bad burns.
But what if it went way beyond that?
What if someone had a face so ugly and hideous that even they couldn't bear the sight of themselves?
That's what happened to Al Simmons, now trapped in a burned body that's not even his own, returning for a lover who's now lost.
He remembers the way his wife used to touch him, caress his face, kiss his lips.
He might as well be trapped in a stony tomb... coldness seeping into the bones, all alone, suffocating in the total darkness.
How does one find humanity in an alley?
How does one regain one's soul in an abandoned church?
For this newest hellspawn, this alley is a waystation... his special purgatory.
...in sickness and in health, until death do you part.
He lurks here in the shadows, amid this human debris, waiting... just inside the portal from Hell.
But this is not his domain.
His domain is that burned skin, his shell of necroplasm and the scarlet shroud which hovers around him, protecting him and possessing him at the same time.
Where is the old man?
- Why isn't he here?
- L... I don't know.
He's a ghost like you.
He just appears.
Al, what's happening to your face?
He's laughing at me!
Hey, come on... it's okay, man. It's okay.
Look, it's just the church bells, man.
Come on, it's
Sunday morning.
Stop it!
Leave me alone!
I am still alive.
Did you think you could strike a deal with Malebolgia... and then renege?
This is a graveyard.
I can feel the death.
Yes, look around you.
These artifacts are all that remain from hellspawns of the past.
They were cursed like you.
This is their shrine... a reminder of what may be your fate!
Maybe you're not a crazy old bum.
What do they call you?
I have had many names.
In this time, they call me Cogliostro.
How long have you been hiding here?
Hiding?
I've been here for many years.
You see, I'm the night curator of antiquities.
This is how I have kept these relics safe
- while I waited for you.
- Waited?
In every age a hellspawn is sent.
I tried to guide them, as I've tried to guide you.
But they are lost souls.
I'm not them.
This is your tomb.
What deal did you strike with him?
It was the time of knighthood,
Time of the Mist.
After the endless battles and the slaughter of innocents, it was I who was sent by Malebolgia to collect the souls and ride with them in the air at night... the Ride of the Dead.
But never to die.
There was no honor in that... not for a knight.
My honor had been taken from me.
I turned away from killing.
The Black Arts drew me.
I struggled with the evil inside and used sorcery to free myself.
In that time
I was known as Merlin.
If you are the Black Knight, then I want answers.
Your flesh rebels against you.
The shroud attacks you.
You wallow in self-pity.
Your loss!
I don't want to hear any more talk, old man!
You claim to be some kind of wizard.
Show me what this goddamn shroud is good for!
No.
You will, old man.
This is not the alley, Hellspawn.
I make the rules in this place.
You are in my domain.
They may have taken your honor but they stole my life.
I came back for Wanda.
But she sees me as a monster.
Do you wish to find the answers?
What are you prepared to do?
I am going to get my life back.
If you won't help me, I'll find the answers somewhere else.
One of your officers found a report on a cop killed in the alleys.
Jason, you're a busy man.
Why are you spending your time reading our New York City police reports?
Chief Banks, if I didn't feel you served a purpose for me,
I wouldn't have gotten you nominated for police commissioner and we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we?
Mr. Wynn, l-I didn't mean to imply that...
The report was written by an officer named Max Williams.
Twitch... smart cop, thorough.
His partner is Sam Burke... a meat-and-potatoes guy.
Your smart cop describes the shooting death of one of your best officers, killed in the alleys.
The dying man's last words on earth were
"red cloak"...find the man in the red cloak.
Don't move in on him until you call me.
Consider it done.
The damn thing is no good.
The sights are off or something.
Yes, sir.
Worthless piece of shit.
- It's jammed!
- Fortunately...
I can usually shoot the dick off a squirrel from here.
Look at this junk.
Stupid gun!
Your lack of aim is surely the gun's fault, sir.
- Lack of aim, huh?
- What? You think you can do better?
You know, Twitch, you really lost your sense of humor. You're too serious.
You gotta learn to lighten up a little.
Let's just see now.
Lucky son of a bitch.
Give me that gun.
Burke! I thought they weren't gonna let you back on the range after that incident last week.
Hey, I've been cleared of that one.
It was the guy's fault... he should have ducked.
You're at a disadvantage,
Burke.
Your gut keeps you too far from the target.
Hey, Twitch, I think the Chief just cracked a joke.
All right, this is your report on one of ours that was killed in the alleys?
We closed that case.
It was our collar.
That cop was killed by a crazy priest.
Before he died, that cop said there were two of them.
That leads me to believe that maybe the priest had a playmate.
He also said something about a red cloak.
I remember... that's a detail I shouldn't have missed, Chief.
Get me a perp.
I don't care if you gotta eat, sleep and breathe those alleys.
And I don't care how much shit you step in.
You should feel right at home there, Burke.
Check it out.
You're missing the point, Lisa.
I don't want you to have a good time in New York.
I want you to have a Ionely, exhausting trip, which indicates to me that you're writing a story that will spill a lot of ink.
Let's cut the bullshit.
If I wasn't the best you wouldn't have sent me.
You got a thing for these psychos, Lisa.
You always manage to get close to them.
Yeah, well my job is to hunt them down.
They all give off the same scent.
What scent is that?
Evil.
- Hey, Lisa?
- Yeah?
You're spooky.
Now tell me what you have.
This guy wears a red cloak.
Hey, he's no joke.
He murders people.
I'm gonna find him and deliver to you his head on a platter.
Like doll's eyes.
Fourth time with this zombie and we don't have shit.
The guy has no prints, no name.
And as soon as he starts in about
"the dead guy is back," I'm gone.
I can't do a fifth dance with this twisted sister.
Nice digs.
It's a good thing you're getting some R&R, big guy.
A wallflower, huh?
You see this?
This is a forensic report.
It says that your DNA matches the cells found underneath the nails of a dead bum.
We also have witnesses that say you killed this less fortunate fellow.
We found this nearby.
He's dead.
I saw him burned to a crisp.
But he's back.
That's it, I'm gone.
Come on, Twitch.
Who's back from the dead?
He looked at me with those green eyes.
That cloak... it reached out
- and touched me like it was alive.
- Did you say cloak?
He's gonna drag me back to Hell.
Tell me, who's come from Hell?
Simmons...
Al Simmons.
What the hell are you doing?
Just checking some details, sir.
How's the chili dog?
Kind of light on the onions.
That may signal a slight improvement in air quality.
Yeah yeah yeah... what a comedian.
I'm gonna grab a soda.
You came in looking for me. Why?
Shall we have a seat?
You wrote some articles for "The Washington Post" about a soldier named Al Simmons.
That's old news, detective.
Why the interest?
I was just wondering if you could offer me anything that was too sensitive to put in print.
- Like?
- You tell me.
A member of a special ops group that saved the president a few years back.
But you already knew all that before you came in the door.
I'm like you...
I do my homework.
You know what, Twitch?
I like you.
You're a good cop.
And I'm a good reporter.
And I know a fluff job when I hear it.
So let's cut the bullshit.
You tell me something,
I'll tell you something.
Ladies first.
I wasn't allowed to print the fact that Al Simmons was burned alive on a mission that the NSC says didn't happen.
Your turn.
I'm working the alley murders... looking for a guy with a red cloak.
I have a perp down at Bellevue that says he got a good look at this guy in the alley; says he has a burned face.
Now you tell me Al Simmons was burned alive.
Coincidences do happen.
I don't believe in coincidences.
Thank you for your time, Miss Wu.
I see the way you look when you talk about Al.
You really loved him.
He was my husband.
No, I mean he was "the one."
Is this going to show up in the paper?
This is just you and me.
What you said before about Al... you're right.
He was that one.
Just hearing his voice excited me.
When he touched me... after he died,
I ached for him.
For months I'd sleep with his shirt or his robe... anything that smelled like him.
Mommy, where are you?
Mom? Mommy.
Mommy's in here, sweet girl.
There you are.
Hi, you're a pretty lady.
I remember you.
I've never seen her take to someone so quickly.
You have a way with her.
Is she Al's child?
No...
Al couldn't give us a child.
Oh...
What's happening with the NSC and Terry?
He lost his job.
Come on, Cyan.
- I'm glad he's not there.
- Up, Mommy.
We're a lot better off now.
Hmm...
Jason Wynn will topple off the mountain.
It is just a matter of time, Wanda.
We almost lost everything. And I still can't get Terry to talk about it.
He stays away for days at a time.
Maybe he's protecting you.
Sometimes the truth is brutal.
It's driving us apart.
Something's wrong.
But he won't let me inside.
Maybe you haven't grieved Al's death.
Do you sometimes feel that he's still with you?
You've seen him, haven't you?
The creature?
Twice.
I've seen what he's capable of and I haven't told anyone.
You know who it is, don't you?
He spoke my name.
There was something in his voice.
I think you should go now.
If you can hear me, Al,
I know you're with me.
I feel it.
Wanda.
I'm hungry, Mama.
I ask you to step out where I can see you... very respectfully.
I warned the last cop not to come into my alley.
Are you threatening me?
What would you do about it?
I'd shoot you between the eyes.
Did you kill him... the police officer?
You got some hard bark on you for a little guy.
No, I didn't kill him.
Murders have occurred in this alley.
One victim was a homeless man.
We have a suspect who wears a skull face... a ritual of some kind.
Chapel... I left him alive for you.
This man you call Chapel... we have him locked away.
He's quite completely insane.
So naturally when he described you,
- we didn't believe it.
- You believed it. You're here.
He claims you're Al Simmons, a soldier who was burned alive five years ago.
What do you think?
I think you've somehow survived a government cover-up.
You're closer than you think.
Can you get me closer?
You want to be a knight in shining armor?
Go play cops and robbers.
Forget all about this.
I wouldn't wanna see your body dumped in my alley.
Confirm Chapel's involvement.
Chapel was just a puppet.
The NSC was pulling the strings.
Who's the puppet master?
What difference does it make?
Do you think you can stop them, little man?
I can do my best.
You were a soldier once... a hero to your country.
What happened to your code of honor?
When you play with matches, you can get burned.
Don't come down to these alleys again.
One of your officers has accessed some of my files,
Chief Banks. Why?
I don't know anything about it.
The only guy here capable of doing that would be Twitch...
Officer Williams.
You asked about him before.
He's working on the killings in the alley.
Find out what he knows.
And after I get the information from Officer Williams?
I understand that New York's Finest who are killed in the line of duty are given quite a hero's burial.
Just tell me where to send the flowers, Chief Banks.
I spoke with the red-cloaked man here in this place.
I believe he's still somewhere in these alleys.
Okay, I'm gonna take a look around, check it out.
This goes all the way up to a high official in the NSC.
And who would this official be?
The only man who can make decisions at this level is Jason Wynn.
My instinct is that the suspect we have down at Bellevue is one of his assassins.
That's quite a story, Twitch.
It sounds like you have a very solid lead.
You've done well, officer.
The department is proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
Officer down!
Get a goddamn ambulance down here!
Jesus, he's bleeding hard from his head.
Officer down! Do you hear me,
God damn it?
Twitch is down!
Look out the window.
And doesn't this remind you of when you were in the boat?
And then later that night, you were lying, looking up at the ceiling, and the water in your head... was not dissimilar from the landscape, and you think to yourself,
"Why is it that the landscape... is moving, but... the boat is still?"
And also...
Where is it that you're from?
- Cleveland.
- Cleveland.
- Lake Erie.
- Erie.
Do you have any parents back in, uh, Erie?
They passed on recently.
And, uh, do you have a wife... in Erie?
No.
- A fiancee?
- Well, I...
I had one of those, but, um, she changed her mind.
- She found herself somebody else.
- No.
Yes, she did.
Well, that doesn't explain... why you've come all the way out here, all the way out here to hell.
I, uh, have a job out in the town of Machine.
Machine? That's the end of the line.
- Is it?
- Yes.
Well, I... received a letter... from the people at Dickinson's
Metal Works...
Oh. assuring me of a job there.
Is that so?
Yes. I'm an accountant.
I wouldn't know, because, uh, I don't read, but, uh, I'll tell you one thing for sure:
I wouldn't trust no words written down on no piece of paper, especially from no "Dickinson" out in the town of Machine.
- You're just as likely to find your own grave.
Look. They're shooting buffalo.
Government says... killed a million of 'em last year alone.
Pardon me, sir. Could you please direct me towards the office?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How do you do, sir?
I'm Bill Blake, your new accountant from Cleveland.
What the heck are you doin' here?
Well, uh, I have here this letter... which confirms my position here.
Well, this letter is postmarked two months ago.
Makes you about a month late.
This here is Mr. Olafsen.
He's our new accountant.
I'm sorry. I think there's been some mistake.
- Look, Mr. Black,
- Blake.
I'm a very busy man, and Mr. Dickinson does not pay me for idle conversation.
Well, I'm sure he doesn't, but this letter confirms my position here.
Now, I've spent everything I had left after my parent's funeral just to get here.
Listen, Mr. Black,
I've got a lot of work to do here, and this ain't my business.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Dickinson.
No, I-I don't think you want to do that.
I insist on speaking to Mr. Dickinson, sir.
You insist?
- I insist.
- You insist?
Yes, I do.
Well, go on then, lad.
There's the door.
All right then.
Go on then!
Well, I will.
Hello?
Mr. Dickinson?
Who the hell are you?
And where did you get that goddamn clown suit? Cleveland?
Well, actually, yes, sir.
I did, uh, get it in Cleveland.
What the hell are you doin' in my office?
Well, I-I-I came to talk about my job.
The only job you're gonna get in here is pushin' up daisies from a pine box.
Now get out.
Thank you very much, sir.
Back to work,
Mr. Olafsen.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Pardon me, sir.
Could I get a bottle, please?
We liked you better when you was a whore.
Jackass.
Shit!
Why don't you just paint my portrait?
I'm sorry.
- Let me help here. One.
- This one's no good. No, it's ruined.
- Two.
- It's no good.
Oh, here. Oh!
Watch yourself.
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.
Here. Have a drink.
Would you like a drink?
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Would you mind walking me away from here?
- S-Sure. Sure.
- Yeah?
I'll just get my suitcase.
- It's that way.
- All right.
Oh, shit.
I have a sneaking suspicion that that large man back there was inebriated.
- I was gonna say something, but
I don't wanna cause any trouble.
No, I think it's best.
That's my room.
Wasn't... expecting any visitor.
- Like it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.
These flowers. Gosh.
They really are something.
Yeah. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I made them from paper.
If I ever get the money,
I'd like to make them out of cloth.
Silk.
And I'd put a drop of perfume...
French perfume... in each one.
What does it smell like?
- Paper.
- Well, it is paper.
Hey, Bill.
You got any tobacco anywhere?
- No, I don't smoke.
- Damn.
Ow!
Oh, watch it.
It's loaded.
Why do you have this?
'Cause this is America.
Charlie.
You know, Thel,
I never wanted to go away.
I know we said it was, uh, it was all over and everything, but... you were always in my heart, Thel.
Always.
I, uh...
I brought you, uh...
Well, it's a present.
A present?
Well, I, uh...
I'm... I'm goin'.
And, uh,
I'm... I'm sorry, Thel, for, uh, for intrudin'.
Well, I never really loved you anyway.
No, Charlie.
- I never stopped lovingly, Thel.
- Don't!
Thel.
Here's white man's metal next to your heart.
I tried to cut it out, but it's too deep inside.
A knife would cut your heart instead... and release the spirit from within.
Stupid fucking white man.
Do you have any tobacco?
I don't smoke.
Hey, Wilson, got any extra tobacco?
Well, of course you wouldn't have any extra tobacco. How 'bout you?
Shit. You ain't even old enough to smoke.
Mr. John Dickinson.
Last night, my youngest son, Charlie...
God bless his soul... was gunned down in cold blood right here in our own hotel.
The gutless murderer, one Mr. Bill Blake, also shot to death Miss Thel Russel, the fiancÃ©e of my beloved son.
Not only that, but he stole a very spirited and valuable horse, a beautiful young pinto that belonged to my personal family stable.
Hell, only, a pinto ain't rightly a horse to fret much about, if the truth be told.
Shut up!
You three are supposed to be the finest killers of men and Indians... in this here half of the world.
Cole Wilson, your reputation is already a legend.
You I know I can trust.
Conway Twill, you're a real good killer, but be sure you keep that goddamn trap shut.
And Johnny
"The Kid"Pickett.
I heard tell you killed 14 men.
I doubt you've seen that many years, and I ain't even gonna tell you what I really think of you.
- I always work alone.
- Uh, excuse me there, Mr. Dickinson, but, uh, rightly I, I never have worked with anyone else either.
- I never have.
- Uh, yeah, m-me neither.
Shut up!
My boy Charlie is dead!
Oh, I ain't askin' this time.
I'm tellin', and if somebody don't like it,
I'm prepared to do a little killin' of my own.
Now, that bastard couldn't have got too far yet.
Well, why don't we just say there, Mr. Dickinson, sir,
I think we oughta start uh, fresh in the mornin'.
I mean, it's well after noon now, and time we get finished, all packed up and...
I want him brought here to me... alive or dead don't matter, though I reckon dead would be easier.
I'm a-hiring boys on an exclusive basis, and I'm willing pay more money than you've ever seen before.
Boys, the hunt is on.
Stupid fucking white man.
I want this out over the wires.
Post a $500 reward from here to hell and back.
Notify every marshal, deputy and possum-skinnin' lowlife in the goddamn territory.
Bring everybody in.
I want that bastard's head.
And make sure you include a full description of my pinto. I want that horse back.
Goddamn pinto is a stupid damn animal.
Stupid as the day is long.
Got his heart so set on one.
Buy yourself a sorrel horse... and paint some white spots on him as far as I'm concerned.
Jesus Christ.
Course, ya can't put much stock in a man who spends the most part of a conversation... talkin' to a bear.
Talkin' to a goddamn bear.
The round stones beneath the earth... have spoken through the fire.
What?
Things which are alike, in nature, grow to look alike, and the speaking stones have lain a long time lookin' at the sun.
The speaking stones?
Some believe they descend with the lightning, but I believe they are on the ground and are projected downward by the bolt.
Did you kill the white man who killed you?
I'm not dead.
What name were you given at birth, stupid white man?
Blake.
William Blake.
Is this a lie?
Or a white man's trick?
No, I'm William Blake.
Then you are a dead man.
I'm sorry. I d...
I don't understand.
Is your name really
William Blake?
Yes.
Every night... and every morn', some to misery are born.
Every morn' and every night, some are born to sweet delight.
Some are born to sweet delight.
Some are born to endless night.
I really don't understand.
But I understand,
William Blake.
You were a poet and a painter.
And now, you are a killer of white men.
You must rest now,
William Blake.
Some are born to sweet delight.
Some are born to endless night.
Makin' biscuits, Mommy.
Sweetheart.
You didn't touch it, did you?
- Huh?
- No.
- You swear to me.
- I swear.
Swear to me you're tellin' the truth.
Yes, I swear I'm tellin' the truth.
Not a goddamn word to no one, ever.
You understand?
Don't ever ask me no questions.
Where are we?
You are being followed,
William Blake.
Are you sure?
I mean, how do you know?
Often the evil stench of white man precedes him.
Why don't we, uh...
Maybe we should, uh...
What should we do?
The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn from the crow.
Ever wish you were the moon?
Geez, my Henry's cold.
Aw, come on!
My britches been open like that how long?
Only been ridin' a couple of days together, but Jesus, one of you fellas could've mentioned the fact that...
Unsaddle your goddamn horses.
Unsaddle your goddamn horse.
Go on.
- Geez.
- An Injun dug this fire pit.
Oh.
Oh, an Indian.
We ain't trackin' no goddamn
Injuns, Cole. I mean, uh, hell, Dickinson didn't say nothin' about trackin' no goddamn Injuns.
I mean, the boy's name is William Blake.
You know a lotta Indians, do ya, named
William Blake? I mean, "Howdy, Chief Billy..."
D'you hear somethin'?
Huh?
- Did ya?
- No. No.
I guess it was nothin'.
You know about Wilson?
- What?
- Do you know about Cole Wilson?
What kinda question is that?
'Course I know about Cole Wilson.
Everybody knows about him.
He's a livin' legend.
Fucked his parents.
- He what?
- He fucked his parents.
- Both of 'em?
- Yeah.
Mother. Father. Parents.
Both of 'em. Fucked 'em.
Oh.
And you know what I heard?
After he killed 'em, he cooked 'em up and ate 'em.
Are you telling me he killed both his pa...
I'm tellin' you he killed 'em. He fucked 'em.
He cooked 'em up. He ate 'em.
He ain't got a goddamn conscience.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
He'd just as soon slit our goddamn throats in the middle of the night as walk.
Course, someone your age, Jesus, if you was to put one in him...
"Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett
Slays Cole Wilson."
William Blake, do you know how to use this weapon?
- Not really.
- That weapon will replace your tongue.
You will learn to speak through it, and your poetry will now be written with blood.
What is your name?
My name is Nobody.
- Excuse me?
- My name is Exaybachay:
He Who Talks Loud,
Saying Nothing.
He Who Talks...
I thought you said your name was Nobody.
I prefer to be called Nobody.
Nobody?
Um, shouldn't you be with your own tribe or somethin'?
My blood is mixed.
My mother was
Ohm gahpi phi gun ni.
My father is
Abso luka.
This mixture was not respected.
As a small boy,
I was often left to myself.
So I spent many months stalking the elk people... to prove I would soon become a good hunter.
One day, finally, my elk relatives took pity on me, and a young elk gave his life to me.
With only my knife,
I took his life.
As I was preparing to cut the meat, white men came upon me.
They were English soldiers.
I cut one with my knife, but they hit me on the head with a rifle.
All went black.
My spirit seemed to leave me.
I was then taken east... in a cage.
I was taken to Toronto, then Philadelphia... and then to New York.
And each time I arrived in another city, somehow the white men had moved... all their people there ahead of me.
Each new city contained the same white people as the last, and I could not understand how a whole city of people... could be moved so quickly.
Eventually, I was taken on a ship... across the great sea... over to England, and I was paraded before them... like a captured animal, an exhibit.
And so I mimicked them, imitating their ways, hoping that they might lose interest in this young savage, but their interest only grew.
So they placed me into the white man's schools.
It was there that I discovered... in a book... the words that you,
William Blake, had written.
They were powerful words, and they spoke to me.
But I made careful plans, and I eventually escaped.
Once again, I crossed the great ocean.
I saw many sad things... as I made my way back to the lands of my people.
Once they realized who I was, the stories of my adventures angered them.
They called me a liar.
"Exaybachay."
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing.
They ridiculed me.
My own people.
And I was left to wander the earth alone.
I am Nobody.
Ain't ya glad the sun kind of sets? Prepares you like?
I mean, what if it, like, went out sudden, like, say, blowin' out a candle or somethin'?
I mean... You know, one minute we're ridin' along, we can see everything and each other... and, boom, the next minute is just... you're in total darkness.
That'd scare the bejesus outta me.
Once upon a time, there were three bears in the forest.
A big bear, a medium mommy bear... and a tiny little baby bear.
One mornin', they were gonna eat their breakfast porridge.
They had a big bowl, a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl.
That porridge was too hot.
Stupid white man.
- So they went to take a walk.
- William Blake, you go to them.
- Along came this girl. She was...
- What?
Alone? Why don't we just go around them?
No!
You go.
It's a test.
I don't know those people, and they don't look very friendly.
- What if they kill me?
- Nobody will observe.
She got sleepy, and she went into their bedroom.
- There was a big bed, a medium bed and a tiny little bed. - All right.
- I'll go.
- ...their tiny bed.
I'd rather not, but I'll go.
The bears got home.
Papa said,
"Somebody here ate all our porridge."
- What's the best way to get down there?
- Be quiet and go.
- And he scalped her,
- All right. and he tore her head off her body.
And he took that golden hair, and he made a sweater for baby bear.
- That's terrible.
- Tonight we're reminded... of the evil emperor
Nero Augustus.
He was the scourge of all the Christians.
What's a scourge?
It's... It's like when somethin' real bad happens.
Like when everybody gets killed and you can't do anything about it.
Like a swarm of locusts.
For the entertainment of his guests,
Nero would illuminate his whole garden... with bodies of live Christians covered in burning oil... strung up on flaming crosses, crucified.
And at dinner, he would have the Christians rubbed by his guards... with aromatic herbs and garlic... and sewn up into sacks.
And then they'd throw these sacks to the wild dogs.
Well, that's terrible.
- It's horrible.
- Terrible's what it is.
You know, I just... I can't drink whiskey like I used to could.
My old belly just ain't no account.
I get the shits every time, don't you know?
I'm sorry, Big George.
I got some food here that even Goldilocks never tasted.
I think this is gonna fix up your old gut.
These beans is shit.
Why don't you shut your goddamn trap and just eat your beans?
Them, uh... There's possum in these beans, and spices too.
- I tried hard.
- Well, Sally,
I don't give a pig's ass what anybody says.
I still say you make a hell of a pot of beans.
Now why don't you say us a grace outta the Good Book, would you?
Thank you, Big George.
I'd be delighted to do that.
"This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand;
And I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee;
And I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day... unto the fowls of the air and the wild beasts of the earth."
Amen.
- What's a Philistine?
- Well, it's just a real dirty person.
Hello.
I smelled beans.
Who are you travelin' with?
I'm with Nobody.
Where you headed?
I don't know.
- Do you like beans?
- I...
I love beans.
Have you got any tobacco?
- I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
- Would you give me some tobacco?
- I would if I had some.
- I'll trade you some beans for some tobacco.
I don't have any tobacco, but I'd love some beans.
Hurt.
- Yes.
- Eyeglasses.
- Yes.
- Pretty suit too.
- I clean up real good, you know.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
- What size shoes are those?
- Ten.
- They look very comfortable. Are they?
Not too bad.
What kinda flower is that?
Well, it's a rose... that's made out of paper.
- Paper?
- Rose.
Now you see there?
- Look at the edge on that knife.
- Hmm.
- Feel that.
- I'd rather not.
Aw, go on.
That...
That is a very, very sharp knife, that is.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Yeah.
What do you call it?
- Pretty.
- I'm sorry?
That hat.
What do you call it?
I'm really not sure.
Ah, your hair.
Your hair is soft.
It's like a girl's.
By God, it is soft.
Now how do you get it that way?
See, this old stuff of mine, it just...
Well, it's just like old barn hay.
- There ain't a durn thing you can do with it.
How do you... How do you get it that way and keep it like that?
Just lucky, I guess.
Lucky. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Goddamn it.
You keep your hand off of it.
I thought I told you not to touch me.
I don't give a good goddamn what you told me.
You keep your hands off his hair.
Why? What's that to do with you then, eh?
That's got plenty to do with me, goddamn it.
- Really? This one's mine!
- That's right.
- This one's yours?
- Yes!
This one's mine, Big George.
You had the last one.
- Is that a fact?
- I saw him first.
I don't give a shit who saw what and who did what or who did who.
You had the last Philistine.
This one's mine.
If I want this one,
I'll have him, too, by God.
Fine. What happens if I just shoot you then, eh?
- What do you think about that?
- You gonna shoot me?
- That's right.
- Well, why don't you shoot me then, goddamn it?
- I will. I'll shoot you right now.
- Come on. Shoot me.
- I will.
- Well, quit talkin' about it and do it, by God.
I will.
- There you go.
- Good God, I'm hit! Lord have mercy!
Burns like hell fire!
You son of a bitch.
I'm gonna have to kill somebody now.
Well, goddamn it,
I guess nobody gets you.
What the hell?
- Nobody.
Oh, Jesus' bears and squirrels.
I cooked, I cleaned, and I sewed, and I have a right to get...
Yee!
Hootka.
That's me.
Wanted.
"The brutal murders of one Thel Russell and one Charles Ludlow Dickinson."
I didn't kill Thel.
I didn't kill Thel.
Your actions are useless.
This is complete fabrication.
There can't be...
You cannot stop the clouds by the building of a ship.
What? What did you say?
You know, I've had it up to here with this Indian malarkey.
I haven't understood a single word you've said since I met you, not one single word.
Are you sure you have no tobacco?
I've already told you
I don't smoke.
If I don't smoke, there's a pretty good chance that I don't have any tobacco.
William Blake.
I guess the best advice just not to take any damn advice.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell... is that?
What's that say?
Read it.
- "Wanted: William Blake."
- Huh?
"In the amount of $500."
Shit.
Hell, ain't we about more fucked than a whore at closin' time, huh?
Thanks to goddamn
Mr. Dickinson, huh?
I'll tell you what that there says, huh?
It says some pelt-wearin' trapper, some stinkin' bean-suckin' possum skinner, he's gonna collect that reward money.
Make you feel good?
Huh?
- Goddamn pelt skinner.
- I'll be damn.
Five hundred dollars.
I don't understand.
I thought we was hired exclusive.
I mean, he paid us in gold in advance.
I'm out here... I'm out here in the middle of shits creek... with two local lunatics.
One who don't say nothin'...
And the other one, he won't never stop yappin'!
You gonna shed tears for us?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- And why not?
- Because it ain't good for your health.
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
Fuck you.
Goddamn it.
Jesus, Cole.
He's just a kid.
He's a Navajo mud toy now.
Yeah.
Aho.
I have just ingested... the food of the Great Spirit... and Father Peyote.
Do you think I could have a little bite of it?
It's not for use even for William Blake.
Flowers of the medicine... give you sacred visions that are not for you right now.
My southern brothers were prohibited from using it... by the Spanish devils.
But now, even the Notoemne and the Dene... know of its loving ways.
What?
What are you lookin' at?
William Blake.
It's so strange that you don't remember any of your poetry.
I don't know anything about poetry.
Oh, you're so modest.
Listen...
I feel very weak.
I'm hungry.
Quest for vision is a great blessing,
William Blake.
To do so, one must go without food and water.
All the sacred spirits... recognize those who fast.
It's good to prepare for a journey in this way.
I seem to have misplaced my eyeglasses.
I can't see clearly.
Perhaps you will see more clearly without them.
You're a very strange man.
Very strange.
May the Great Spirit watch over you, William Blake.
Nobody?
Nobody?
Nobody?
Nobody?
- Hey, Marvin.
- What?
How come Dickinson's telegram didn't give no description of the horse... this murderin' fucker stole?
It did, Lee. A pinto, just like that one.
White legs, brown ass, brown sides.
It did? I don't think it did, Marvin.
Well, you asshole... You got the damn telegram on you. Take it out and look.
That's right. Yeah, I got it here.
I'll check it.
Maybe I been thinkin' of them wanted posters.
Lee! It's him!
You William Blake?
Yes, I am.
Do you know my poetry?
Some are born to endless night.
Well, Rome weren't built in a day, Cole.
Course, uh, I wasn't overseein' that particular job.
Fresh kill.
Yeah. No damn tobacco, that's for sure.
This, uh, some kind of telegram or somethin'?
What's that say?
Dickinson again.
Oh, goddamn Dickinson. You mean to tell me he's even got the law involved in this now?
Jesus.
Tell you one thing. FL, uh, that there
Blake fella keeps on shootin' marshals,
I'll wind up likin' the bastard.
Looks like a goddamn religious icon.
Anyhow, greenback to the beginning of the story, my granddaddy come over from Scotland, you see.
He was actually part of the Mactwill clan.
Uh, the, uh, clan tartan was kind of gold and purple, if I remember correctly.
I never wore a lick of it myself.
Dropped the "Mac" part of the name when he decided to come out West... on account of he figured it'd get him more work and all.
How 'bout your family history there, Cole? Let me guess.
Kind of figured you for a German, huh?
I mean, am I right?
Am I close?
Austrian?
I'd like to speak with
Mr. Dickinson, please.
- I insist on speaking with Mr. Dickinson.
Goddamn redskins.
Oh!
- Nobody?
- William Blake.
She's upset.
She's beautiful.
- She didn't mean to call you that.
- Huh?
But you sure interrupted a very romantic moment, William Blake.
Oh. I'm sorry.
You stay here 'til I return.
Don't let the sun burn a hole in your ass, William Blake.
Rise now and drive your cart and plow... over the bones of the dead.
Do you still have my eyeglasses?
No. I traded 'em.
- You traded them?
- Do you have any tobacco?
No. I traded it.
- For what?
- I'm not telling.
- Liar.
- Thief.
I don't care if you were married 16 times
I still love you
Yo-ho yo-ho-yo
I will take you to the bridge made of waters.
The mirror.
Then you will be taken up to the next level of the world.
The place where
William Blake is from.
Where his spirit belongs.
I must make sure that you pass back through the mirror at the place... where the sea meets the sky.
White man's trading post.
Indians get diseases there.
What do you mean?
Smallpox, consumption.
Blankets are infected.
It spreads through the villages.
I see you have acquired a new weapon.
Hmm? Oh, yes.
A Winchester.
- Here. Take it.
- No.
No, really.
Take it.
I took it off a dead white man.
Did William Blake kill this white man?
Yes.
William Blake killed the white man.
We need a canoe.
Water.
"The brutal murders of Charles Dickinson and fiancÃ©e, Thel Russell.
Also the murders of the following territorial marshals...
...deputy... Big George Drakoulious,
Benmont Tench and one Salvatore Sally Jenko."
- It's not bad.
- Huh?
It's not a bad illustration of you, William Blake.
Well, I want you to have it.
- It's a present.
- Aho.
Good morning.
May you serve the Lord, and may His holy dominion guide you through your dismal life.
How can I be of assistance, my poor man?
All our ammunition is guaranteed.
This latest batch was, in fact, personally blessed by the archbishop of Detroit.
Good morning.
May our Lord Jesus Christ wash this earth with His holy light... and purge its darkest places from heathens and philistines.
The vision of Christ that thou dost see... is my vision's greatest enemy.
Do you have tobacco?
We sure don't.
Aren't those tins of tobacco right there behind you?
Sure are, but those cans are empty.
There's no tobacco in them.
Perhaps I could interest you in some beads... or possibly a blanket.
Blanket.
Yes, my fine fellow.
Ammunition.
Uh, I'd like some tobacco, please.
Well, I may have one or two twists left.
From my personal supply, you understand.
For good friends only.
Good Lord.
You're William Blake.
Yes, I am.
By the grace of the Lord Almighty.
Sir, would it be presumptuous of me to ask you for... for your autograph?
Please, kind sir.
It would be a great honor.
Pardon me.
There's my autograph.
God damn your soul to the fires of hell.
He already has.
Hootka.
I'm tired.
I'll free the horses.
I see you collected some more white man's metal.
Yes. I seem to be a magnet for it.
Oh, man.
Good day for a canoe ride.
Nobody?
Is this the boat... that'll take me across the mirror of water?
No.
This boat's not strong enough,
William Blake.
William Blake is a legend now
He's a good friend of mine
Stand up,
William Blake.
William Blake.
Ah.
Walk proudly,
William Blake.
That man there?
I know him.
He's a great builder of sea canoes.
Hello.
I prepared your canoe with cedar boughs.
It's time for you to leave now, William Blake.
Time for you to go back to where you came from.
You mean Cleveland?
Back to the place where all the spirits came from... and where all the spirits return.
This world will no longer concern you.
Found some tobacco.
The tobacco is for your voyage,
William Blake.
Nobody.
I don't smoke.
Aho, William Blake.

HE TOLD ME HOW THEY WORKED
ON A FARM
AND SOLD CORN
AT A ROADSIDE MARKET.
[ SNORTS ]
SHE LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LADY.
YEAH. A VERY NICE LADY.
THATÂ´S FUNNY.
I COULD HAVE SWORN
I HEARD YOU SAY SOMETHING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
NO.
THATÂ´S RIGHT! YOU DID!
I KNOW YOUÂ´RE TRYING TO TELL ME
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
WHY CANÂ´T I UNDERSTAND?
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, HANKY.
PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE TIME
CAN UNDERSTAND ANIMALS,
ESPECIALLY THE PURE IN HEART,
LIKE US KIDS.
KEEP TALKING.
REPEAT WHAT YOU JUST OINKED.
READY?
NOW, LISTEN CLOSE.
PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE TIME...

DEAR JESSICA, HOPE EVERYTHINGÂ´S
OKAY WITH YOU AND HANKY.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
WEÂ´RE BACK ON THE DUSTY TRAIL.
JINNIE REALLY LIKED
MEETING HANKY,

SHEÂ´S MISSING THE PIG.
HOPE HEÂ´S NOT EATING TOO MUCH.
JINNIEÂ´S DOING GREAT.

IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT
OF FRIENDLY COMPETITION,
IÂ´VE INVITED HANKY
AND HIS LITTLE FRIEND GORDY
TO HEAR THE RESULTS.
OF COURSE. I JUST HOPE THEYÂ´RE
NOT TOO DISAPPOINTED.
OUR CONSUMER-RESEARCH DIRECTOR,
MR. BRINKS, HAS BEEN WAITING
TO GIVE US A FULL REPORT
ON THE MARKET TEST.
NO CONTEST, MR. ROYCE.
SEE WHAT I TOLD YOU?
IN COMPLIANCE
WITH STATISTICAL ANALYSIS,
DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES
ARE WEIGHED
ACCORDING
TO ECONOMIC FACTORS --
SKIP THE GOBBLEDYGOOK,
MR. BRINKS.
WHICH BRAND
DID THE PUBLIC CHOOSE?
HERO PIG OUTSOLD THE COMPETITION
100 TO 1.
[ CROWD GASPS ]
WOW.
BUT JESSICA HAD TO WIN.
IÂ´M SORRY, MY DEAR.
PEOPLE JUST CANÂ´T RESIST
A BABY ANIMAL.
LOOK, THEREÂ´S BEEN A MISTAKE.

SORRY, SIPES.
THE PUBLIC HAS SPOKEN.
WEÂ´LL SIGN GORDY

WELL, YOU THINK
HE LOOKS CUTE NOW,
BUT HEÂ´LL GROW INTO A HOG
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.
YOU THINK THOSE PICTURES
OF JESSICA LOOKED FAT?
WEÂ´RE TALKING LARD CITY.
I REGRET TO SAY THIS, SIPES,
BUT MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
IS SHAKEN.
FROM NOW ON, IÂ´LL SUPERVISE
GORDYÂ´S PUBLICITY BUILDUP
PERSONALLY.
WE FOUND OUR NEW IMAGE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
FROM NOW ON,
HERO PIG BRANDS IS US.
[ SQUEALING ]

THE WORLDÂ´S FAVORITE PIG.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

AND HE WANTS DESPERATELY
TO GO LOOK FOR THEM.
I LOVE YOU, GORDY!
[ SNORTS ]
GORDY WANTS TO GO?
NO. WELL, HE CANÂ´T.
HEÂ´S BECOMING
A NATIONAL INSTITUTION.
PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN GORDY
TO THEIR HEARTS.
TELL HIM I ONLY WANT
TO DO WHATÂ´S RIGHT.
HE DOESNÂ´T WANT TO LET
ANYONE DOWN, GRANDPA.
HE ONLY WANTS TO DO
WHATÂ´S RIGHT.

MAIN STREET AND WALL STREET,
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS
ON THE OUTLOOK
FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY?
[ SNORTING ]
GRANDPA WOULD BE PROUD
OF YOU, GORDY.
THANKS, HANKY.
BUT I REALLY THINK
ITÂ´S TIME FOR ME
TO GET GOING
AND FIND MY FAMILY.
THEY COULD BE IN TROUBLE.
YOUÂ´RE RIGHT.
TIMEÂ´S RUNNING OUT.
WHY DONÂ´T WE PUT A NOTICE
ON OUR PRODUCTS?
IÂ´M AFRAID WEÂ´D GET A MILLION
PIGS KNOCKING DOWN OUR DOOR.
-Mr. Royce, line three.
-Hello, there, Hanky?
ItÂ´s me, Cousin Jake,
CALLING LONG-DISTANCE
FROM THE COUNTRY-MUSIC CAPITAL
OF THE UNITED STATES,
BRANSON, MISSOURI.
HELLO, COUSIN JAKE.
WELL, HELLO, THERE,
YOURSELF, GORDY.
LISTEN, LITTLE FELLA,
WE NEED YOUR HELP REAL BAD.
HELP?
THE TOWN IS FULL
OF COUNTRY-MUSIC SUPERSTARS,
AND WEÂ´RE NOBODY.
HOW CAN WE HELP?
WELL, I TOLD THEM THAT WE KNEW
A SUPER DUPER STAR,
SO IF WE CAN GET GORDY
TO COME OUT HERE
AND MAKE A PERSONAL APPEARANCE,
THEYÂ´LL HIRE US
AS A SUPPORT BAND.
WEÂ´D LIKE TO HELP, COUSIN JAKE,
BUT GORDYÂ´S GOT TO SEARCH
FOR HIS FAMILY.
I EXPLAINED THAT.
AND THE BRANSON CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE
SAID THEY WANTED TO SET UP
A NATIONWIDE TELECAST
TO HELP GORDY MAKE AN APPEAL
TO FIND HIS FOLKS.
WELL, IF ITÂ´LL HELP
FIND GORDYÂ´S FOLKS
AND HELP THE BAND --
THE ANSWER IS YES.
WEÂ´RE ON OUR WAY.
THANKS, HANKY, GORDY.
SEE YOU SOON.

IT MEANS
WE MUSTNÂ´T LOSE HOPE.
NO MATTER HOW COLD AND LONELY
IT GETS, GORDY WILL FIND US.
WELL, IF ITÂ´LL HELP
FIND GORDYÂ´S FOLKS
AND HELP THE BAND --
[ SNORTING ]
Thanks, Hanky, Gordy.
See you soon.
THEYÂ´RE GOING TO BRANSON.
THEYÂ´LL BE AWAY FROM EVERYONE,

WHAT IS IT, COUSIN JAKE?
Well, I delivered a load of Meadow Brook farm pigs up to the fattening yards in Broken Bow.

- What about your breakfast?
- I've got some sandwiches in my pack.
- Be home for supper.
- No worries, Mom.
I know, I'm coming.
Hustle up, Nelson.
Faloo's sounding the call!
Come on, little wombats, hurry!
Who's caught this time?
You don't know her, Cody.
Her name is Marahute, the great golden eagle.
Where is she?
She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.
- You're the only one who can reach her.
- I'll get her loose.
Righto. Hop on, no time to lose.
She's up on top of that ridge.
Be careful, little friend.
Marahute!
Calm down, calm down.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
That's a girl. Stay still.
It's okay.
No, wait! I'm here to help you.
Easy! Easy!
You're free!
Higher!
Whoa!
Wow.
You're a mom!
They're very warm.
Are they gonna hatch soon?
Where's the daddy eagle?
Oh. My dad's gone, too.
Hey, little fella, what happened to you?
Oh, no! Get away!
- Don't worry. I'll get you loose.
- It's a trap. Careful!
Got one!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okey-dokey.
- Wait! Hey, come back!
Here you go, grab on.
That's great. Just a little more, a little further...
There! I got it.
Well, Joanna, what'd we get today?
A dingo, a fat ol' razorback, or a nice big...
Boy?
Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again?
Dumb lizard always trying to bury squirrels out here.
Uh-uh. It's a trap, and poaching's against the law.
Trap? Where'd you get an idea like that?
I think you've been down in that hole for too long.
Come on, grab hold.
We'll get you out of this old lizard hole and you can just run along home.
This is a poacher's trap and you're a poacher.
Let go! Hey, get off of me.
McLEACH: I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill that dumb, slimy, egg-sucking salamander.
Cut it out! Get off of me.
Hmm.
Good girl, Joanna.
Say, where'd you get this pretty feather, boy?
It was a present.
That's real nice. Who gave it to you?
It's a secret.
That's no secret, boy.
You see, I already got the father.
You just tell me where Momma and those little eggs are.
No!
Joanna, sic him!
You're coming with me, boy.
My mom'll call the rangers!
Oh, no. Not the rangers.
What'll I do?
What'll I do? Don't let your mom call the rangers!
Please don't!

Would you...
Would you excuse me for a minute?
Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle
Bianca, I have important news.
Yes, FranÃ§ois? What is it?
You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to Australia.
The poor boy. This is dreadful.
Now where is Bernard?
I must tell him at once!
Allow me, madame,
I will tell him immediately.
Miss Bianca, will you marry me?
Quickly, Monsieur Bernard!
I must speak with you.
- Not now, FranÃ§ois, I'm busy!
- No, monsieur, you don't...
- Bernard, did you talk to FranÃ§ois?
- Yes, but there's something I want...
I know what you're going to say.
FranÃ§ois told me about it.
He did? How did he...
It doesn't matter, I think it's a marvelous idea.
You do?
I mean, you really want to?
I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty.
Duty? I never thought of it...
Well, all right. How does next April sound to you?
Heavens, no! We must act immediately, tonight!
Tonight? But wait!
Bianca, this is so sudden. I mean, don't you at least need a gown or something?
No, just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots!
Hiking boots?
Oh, there you are.
Come along, come along.
Delegates, we have an important announcement.
Bernard and I have decided to accept the mission to Australia.
Australia?
Good show! Now, you must fly out immediately!
It's a little nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we?
Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's a good idea to fly this soon after eating!
Darling, you'll be just fine!
But aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes?
Oh, just knock on the door and see if Orville is there!
Nobody's home, let's go.
This is no time to play in the snow.
I wasn't playing in the snow.
It was an avalanche.
Look, Bernard!
"Under new management, see Wilbur."
Come on, darling.
Let's get a move out!
I'm the cat's pajamas
Always run around with crazy little mamas
Whoo!
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Wilbur!
Get down there, son!
Hello?
Pick it, boy, pick it! Yeah!
Whoo! Here we go! Let's walk!
Whoo!
Look out! Excuse me, sir.
Do something! He can't hear us!
Big time, big time!
The girls all look when I go by...
Who killed the music?
That's better.
Excuse us for interrupting.
We're from the Rescue Aid Society.
I am Miss Bianca, and this is my...
The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it.
My brother, Orville, told me all about you. Boy. This is an honor to have...
May I just say, "EnchantÃ©, seÃ±orita," to you? May I?
We need to charter a flight.
You've come to the right place, buddy boy. Welcome to...
"Albatross Air. A fair fare from here to there."
Get it? A fair fare?
It's a play on... Never mind.
I've got tons of exotic destinations, faraway places, custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway.
The finest in-flight accommodations.
Speaking of which, what can I get you?
How about a nice mango Maui cooler?
Very nice, very tasty.
No, thank you.
A coconut, guava nectar?
It's carbonated.
I got little umbrellas for each one, and a little coconut thing.
- It's urgent that we leave immediately!
- Nothing? Nothing at all?
- How about a cream soda?
- We need a flight to Australia.
Australia? The land down under?
That's a fabulous idea!
So when can I pencil you in?
After spring thaw?
Mid-June would be very nice.
We must leave tonight.
Tonight?
Come on, you're kidding me, right?
Have you looked outside?
It's suicide out there.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait.
What a bunch of jokers.
But you don't understand, a boy needs our help. He's in trouble.
Boy? You mean, a little kid kinda boy?
He was kidnapped.
Kidnapped? Oh, that's awful.
Locking up a little kid.
A kid should be free.
Free to run wild through the house on Saturday mornings.
Free to have cookies and milk, and get those little white mustaches.
Nobody's gonna take a kid's freedom away while I'm around.
Does that mean you'll take us?
Storm or no storm,
Albatross Airlines, at your service!
Passengers are requested to fasten their seat belts and secure all carry-ons.
We'll be departing following our pre-flight maintenance. Thank you.
Loosen up, get the blood flowing up to the head.
And a couple of these...
Okay, one's enough, there we go.
Ah, yeah! That feels better. Oh, baby.
Tie your kangaroos down, sports fans!
Here we come!
Let's go for it! Whoa! Hey!
I didn't adjust for the winds.
All right, we're gonna make it!
Gotta duck down lower.
Go under the wind, go under it!
Here we go! Whoo-hoo!
Ow! This is cold!
Slippery! Ice!
We got ice!
Whoa! Hang on now!
Here we go!
Whoa! Cowabunga!
Captain, is this a non-stop flight to Australia?
Well, not exactly no.
I could definitely say no.
We're gonna have to make connections with a bigger bird.
Non-stop? What do I look like,
Charles Lindbergh?
Let me out of here! Let me go!
You can't do this!
Help!
Breaker, breaker, little mate.
I forgot to tell you around here, you need to be quiet!
Or the rangers might hear you.
Now sit down and relax, enjoy the view.
Nothing but abandoned opal mines as far as the eye can see.
And dead ahead, is home sweet home.
Home, home on the range
Where the critters are tied up in chains
I cut through their sides
And I rip off their hides
And the next day, I do it again
Everybody!
Home, home on the range...
Cody! Cody!
Cody!
Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is now approaching Sydney airport.
Make sure your seat belts are fastened and tables secured.
Enjoy your stay in Australia.
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
Perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.
All right, I'll get him up.
Wilbur.
Wilbur!
Just five more minutes, Ma.
- Wilbur!
- That's all I need, five more minutes.
Wilbur, are you awake?
- Get up, we're there!
- I'm up, I'm up.
Watch out!
Must have been sleeping on a bolt.
Oh, boy.
Throw another shrimp on the barbie, 'cause here I come!
- Here we go again!
- Cannonball!
Gangway! Coming through.
Mice on board!
Clear the way! Move over madam, there you go!
Coming through, sir. Thank you.
Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.
Did we lose anyone back there?
Miss Bianca, from now on, can't we just take the train?
Well, Sparky, you've had this coming for a long time.
And now, you're gonna get it.
Ha!
Wise fly.
Mugwomp tower,
this is Albatross 1-3 requesting permission to land. Over?
Albatross? Let's see.
Finch, wren, scrub-bird, lorikeet, freckled duck, galah,
Kookaburra, parrot, cockatoo, alba... It's a jumbo!
Negative, you'll have to turn back.
- Our runway isn't long enough for you.
- Not long enough?
Look pal, I can land this thing on a dime!
Wilbur, if the runway isn't long enough...
You can't let radar jockeys push you around. Leave it to me.
I say again, mate, our runway is too short.
And I say again, mate, I'm coming in!
Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky, we gotta extend the runway.
Here we go!
We'll never make it!
Hot!
Passengers, please remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop.
Thank you.
Whoa!
Quick, Sparky, we need to make a drag line!
Don't try and tell me the runway's too short.
Hold this for me, will you, pal?
Bloke ought to have his wings clipped.
Captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines...
Crazy Yanks.
They think they can do any fool thing without regard for...
Welcome to Australia, ma'am.
Name's Jake. If there's any way
I can make your stay pleasant, don't hesitate to ask.
- Oh, how kind.
- Allow me to get that bag for you.
I've got a lot of luggage here.
Let me give you a hand with those.
Part of the friendly service at Albatross...
Ow! Big time hurt!
Back! It's out!
- Are you all right?
- Don't worry, I'll handle this.
Sparky, watch the tower. We gotta get this bird to the hospital.
Can't go down, can't go up.
Take the bags!
- Heave! Ho!
- What are you doing?
What's going on? Wait!
- Wait a minute. Just stop everything.
- Wilbur, don't worry.
We'll come back the moment we find the boy.
Wait! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here, please!
I'm feeling much better now.
I'm even ready to hit the beaches.
I'm even ready to mambo.
Doctor, will he be all right?
Now, my dear. Keep a stiff upper lip.
They all come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.
Off with you now. Leave everything to me. Shoo, shoo. Off you go.
Hop to it, ladies. We've got a bent bird on our hands.
- Move, bustle, bustle. That's it.
- Will it hurt, Doc?
Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.
- Launch the back brace!
- Hey, wait!
I've been skewered!
I've already missed tea, Mr. Albatross.
Now don't force me to take drastic measures. You must relax.
Relax? I have never been more relaxed in my life!
If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!
I'm not convinced.
60 milligrams!
60 milligrams.
Hey! What?
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do that to me!
I'm an American citizen, buddy!
- Better double it!
- Double?
- Double, coming up!
- No!
Prepare the albatross for medication.
I'm dreaming! Come on,
Wilbur. Wake up, boy!
- Three degrees right.
- Come on!
- Three degrees right.
- Down two degrees.
Don't go down two!
- Down two degrees.
- Ready!
No, I'm not ready! No, please!
Aim!
Please don't do this to me.
Fire!
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
So are you and your husband here on a little outback excursion?
No, we're not married.
In fact, we're here on a top secret mission.
Very hush-hush.
Gonna rescue that kid McLeach nabbed?
Why, that's right! How did you know?
You'll find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback, miss.
So which way you taking?
Suicide Trail through Nightmare
Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge?
- "Suicide Trail"?
- Good choice.
More snakes, less quicksand.
Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot-free, that is until...
Dead Dingo Pass.
Wait a minute, I don't see any of that stuff on the map.
A map's no good in the outback!
What you really need is someone who knows the territory.
Mr. Jake, will you guide us?
At your service!
Better take my arm, miss.
It's gonna be a treacherous hike.
I remember the time it was just me and 400 of these big, giant...
Doesn't even know how to fold a map.
This is how we get around in the outback, Miss B.
The only way to travel, Berno.
Yeah, it's just a little bumpy back here.
Cinch up your seat belts, mates.
We're coming in for a landing.
Hold it, not yet!
Well, boy, let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty, old memory of yours.
Is she on Satan's Ridge?
Or Nightmare Canyon?
What do you think?
Yeah, that's it.
Right smack dab in the middle at Croc Falls!
- Am I getting warm?
- I told you, I don't remember.
Don't you realize a bird that size is worth a fortune?
I'll split the money 50/50.
You can't get a better offer than that.
You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you.
Jake's been gone... Ow!
Been gone a long time.
Maybe I should go... Oh!
Maybe I should go look for him.
Don't you worry about Jake.
He can handle himself.
Yeah, I noticed.
I am just sure he'll be back in no time.
You know, now that we're alone, there's...
There's something that I've been wanting to ask you.
Yes? What is it?
Well, it's like this.
Miss Bianca, I would be most honored if...
Look out!
No mice for you, Twister, not today!
There!
Miss Bianca!
I've been looking all over for you.
Now look.
We got a long way to go, and you're gonna take us there.
You're not gonna give us any trouble about it.
Right?
They're harmless once you look them in the eye, let them know who's boss.
Ain't that right, mate? Now get.
It's all right, Bernard.
Jake has everything under control.
Yeah, I noticed.
You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told,
I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.
There was this one time, it was just me and 300 of these ferocious, mouse-eating dingoes.
Had me surrounded...
I'll give you a night down here to think it over.
But tomorrow, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Joanna! You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!
I'll never tell you where she is!
Never! Never!
Yeah, we'll never tell!
You'll have to drag it out of us!
Hey, where did you come from?
The desert?
Well, fancy that!
Looks like McLeach has begun trapping his own kind!
There's no hope for any of us now.
No hope? No hope!
- No!
- But there must be a way out of here.
There's a way out, all right.
There is?
Absolutely.
You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt, and our dear Frank...
- I don't want to hear it.
- Frank will go as...
I can't hear you!
- A purse.
- No!
A lovely ladies' purse.
I don't want to go as a purse.
Please, don't let him do it!
- Don't worry, we'll get out of here.
- We are?
Yeah. If we all put our heads together,
I'm sure we'll think of something.
Yeah, something.
Frank, what's wrong?
Oh, here he goes again.
Take it easy. You don't want to hurt yourself again.
Ooh. I got it!
All we gotta do is get the keys!
Oh. Is that all? Well then, we better start packing our bags.
No, wait. He's right.
If we could get these long pieces of wood...
Yeah, wood, good.
Maybe we could...
That's right, just a little more. There!
Come on, everybody.
Get some more stuff!
The kid's right.
What are we waiting for?
That's it, you've got it!
Hurry. We need something to tie it together.
Hey, what do you got?
Shoelaces!
Almost.
- A little further.
- Yeah, yeah.
- it's okay. Let's try again.
- Yeah, yeah.
Easy. Easy does it.
Yeah, no, no! Yeah, yeah.
Will somebody shut him up?
- We did it!
- You've got it!
I've got it! I'll just take my tail, and I'll pick the lock, like this!
Frank, give it a rest.
You'll thank me when you're free.
Look, I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit further.
Show him who's boss, Berno!
I feel like I got my head in a vice.
Oh!
- Are we ready, nurse?
- Ready, Doctor.
All right, ladies, snap to it!
Ooh, that smarts!
Ah, let me see here.
- Forceps!
- Forceps.
Oh, no, what now?
- Spinal stretch-u-lator.
- That's gonna hurt.
Artery router.
Mother!
This is rusted tight. I wouldn't dream of using such a tool.
Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter!
The epidermal what?
Oh, no! No!
Mr. Albatross, we haven't operated yet!
- You gotta catch me first, Doc.
- Mr. Albatross, please!
Cowabunga!
Mr. Albatross, we must return you to the operating room!
You'll never take me alive!
Please don't do this!
Your spine needs tender... loving... care!
Oh! Oh!
My back!
Hey! Hey!
I can... It works! I'm cured!
My back!
Don't worry!
I'm coming, you little mice.
This is the finest fleet on two webbed feet.
Oh, boy, I gotta go on a diet when I get home.
Here we go!
In other news, authorities in Mugwomp Flats
called off the search for the missing boy.
His backpack was found near
Crocodile Falls, and rangers believe
he was yet another victim of crocodile attack.
Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution...
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Who outsmarted who?
Who? Who outsmarted who?
I still gotta get that boy to talking.
I'm hungry. Can't think on an empty stomach.
Gotta have protein. Gotta have eggs.
Everyone's got his price.
All I gotta do is offer him whatever he wants, and then not give it to him.
Did you take one of my eggs?
Open your mouth.
These are not Joanna eggs.
Let's see. The boy's got the eagle.
I want the eagle.
The boy won't give me the eagle.
If I could just find the boy's weak spot,
I could get him to tell me where the eagle is.
But the boy's only got one weak spot, and that is the eagle.
Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill, that would loosen his tongue and then...
I got it!
Got your hand caught in the cookie jar.
Who you think you're messing with, you dumb animal?
My mental facilities are twice what yours are, you pea brain.
Joanna, I give you platypus eggs,
I give you snake eggs, why, I'll even give you eagle eggs, but I want you to stay away from my...
The eagle's eggs!
That's it!
That's the boy's weak spot!
Push it in a little bit farther, take it back a little bit...
I give up!
I'll never get this. We're doomed!
Doomed!
Hey, look! Krebbs, Frank's out!
Frank, you're free!
Free?
I'm free! I'm free! I'm free!
Shh! Joanna'll hear!
Double or nothing, he's caught in five minutes.
- Calm down, little mate.
- Didn't I tell you?
Look at me, I'm free!
Frank, get the keys.
I should get the keys.
I'm stuck!
Shh! Quiet!
Quiet, you fool!
Take it easy, I'll get you loose.
There you go.
Now go get the keys.
The keys. Yeah, yeah.
Keys, keys, keys.
I can't reach them.
Quick, get something to stand on.
Stand on, something to stand on.
This ought to be rich.
Stand on...
Frank.
Use the box! Climb up on the box!
Of course, a box!
- Quiet!
- These darn things are heavy!
Whoops.
The keys, give us the keys!
Over here! Give us the keys!
Yee-haw! Ride him, Frank!
Yah-hoo! Howdy, howdy!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!
Huh. Missed.
McLEACH: Surprise!
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you didn't like it here.
Let me go, let go! Let go!
What are you doing out of your cage?
Hmm. That's better.
Come on, boy.
Say goodbye to your little friends.
It's the last you'll ever see of them.
There is no time to waste.
- We must try to get in.
- Here, Miss Bianca, start digging.
Has anyone considered trying, "Open sesame"?
Hey, it worked!
McLEACH: Get out of here! Go on! Get!
Look, Bernard, it's the boy!
And McLeach.
It's all over, boy.
Your bird's dead. Someone shot her.
Shot her, right outta the sky.
No!
What do you mean, no?
You callin' me a liar?
I heard it on the radio.
And she could have been mine if it weren't for you.
Now you better get, before I change my mind.
Go on, get!
- Why is he letting him go?
- It's gotta be a trick.
Too bad about those eggs, eh, Joanna.
They'll never survive without their mother.
Oh, well. Survival of the fittest, I guess.
Bingo!
- Bird?
- Eggs?
Shh. Listen.
I didn't make it all the way through third grade for nothing.
Don't know where he's going, but we can't let him get away.
- Hurry up, you two!
- Quickly, Bernard, now!
Oh, no!
Get between the treads!
Bernard, Bianca, here, catch!
Got it! Miss Bianca, you can do it!
Boy, this is some head wind.
Say, you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice running around down there, would you?
Hey, where you going?
I mean it, I'm looking for two little mice!
Is it something I said?
He's going down the cliff.
Come on, we gotta warn him.
- Cody.
- Huh?
- Who are you?
- There is no time to explain.
You're in great danger.
Marahute? It can't be!
Cody, wait!
She's alive!
Cody, please! You must listen!
That's right,
McLeach is on the cliff.
Marahute, no! Turn back! Turn back!
Stay away! It's a trap!
I got her! I got her!
Did you see that?
Perfect shot! Perfect shot!
She's mine!
All mine!
No!
Hold tight you two.
We're going for a ride!
- Bianca!
- Bernard!
Meddlin' brat.
Gonna get rid of him for good.
Help, I'm slipping!
Cody, don't move!
There she is, Joanna.
Just look at her.
Look at the size of her.
The rarest bird in the world.
That bird's gonna make me rich.
Filthy rich.
I got what I want.
Now, what does Joanna want?
Does she wanna make sure that bird stays rare?
How about some great, big, triple-A, jumbo eagle eggs?
Huh? You want them?
Huh? You want them? Go get them!
No! Please!
Why, whatever is the matter?
Get moving!
Joanna!
You hurry up and eat those eggs and get your tail up here!
Move it!
Okay, you guys, she fell for it.
Looks like the coast is clear.
Girls? Girls, I'm here!
Where are you, you little chickees, you?
Wilbur?
Wilbur!
Don't ever do that to me again!
Boy, I lost a lot of feathers on that one.
Wilbur, am I glad to see you!
- Help me with these eggs, will you?
- Sure.
Wait a minute, what the heck are you doing up here?
The kidnapper took the boy and Jake. Miss Bianca.
Miss Bianca's in trouble? Whoa!
That's terrible! We gotta do something!
Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.
Hiding under a nest while Bianca needs help.
- I gotta talk to you, mister.
- Wilbur.
You should start searching the desert for her, and I'll scan the coastline!
That's what I'll do.
Ask the chicks on the beach.
What?
Listen! There's some chicks here that need help.
Really?
Oh, no. Wait a minute. Hold it.
I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong. Don't even, no.
Don't look at me!
You're getting "no." Understand?
I will not ever sit on those eggs!
Aw, nuts!
Gotta learn to be more assertive.
No is no is no.
Hey, quit moving in there!
Well, Joanna, it looks like Lady Luck has finally decided to smile on us.
Everything's going our way.
You can't do this!
You're gonna get in big trouble!
I'll tell the rangers where you are!
I almost forgot.
We got a loose end to tie up, haven't we, girl?
Now, now, Cody, we mustn't lose hope.
- Bernard is still out there.
- That's right!
If anyone can get us out of this scrape, it's old Berno!
- Nice bluff, Miss B.
- I wasn't bluffing.
You don't know Bernard like I do.
He'll never give up.
Oh, my gosh!
Uh... Excuse me.
Look, I've got a long way to go, you're going to take me there, and you're not going to give me any trouble, right?
Good.
Now, get!
Are you ready, boy?
It's time you learned how to fish for crocs!
They like it when you use live bait.
And you're as live as they come.
Oh!
You get a line
And I'll get a pole, matey
You get a line
I'll get a pole, friend
Oh, you get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crocodile hole
Buddy, pal of mine
That's right, babies. Suppertime!
It don't look good, Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one.
Bernard, please hurry!
Now, this is my idea of fun.
Nothing personal, boy, but I wouldn't want to disappoint the rangers.
They was looking so hard for you, and now they're gonna find you!
What the blaze is going on here?
Joanna.
Did you know there was a razorback in my truck? Did ya?
There was a razorback in my truck!
Now you quit playing around and do your job, you four-legged python!
Hey, what happened to them keys?
Must be around here somewhere.
They couldn't just get up and walk away.
Something weird's going on around here. I smell a big, fat rat.
- Look, it's Bernard!
- I don't believe it!
- Way to go, mate!
- Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!
Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
Blast!
Oh, my gosh! I hope I know what I'm doing.
Hey, get off me!
Whoa! Whoa!
Joanna! Joanna!
You stupid lizard! Get off me!
You idiot!
Get off of me!
No! No!
Bernard, the boy!
Help!
Help!
Get back!
Get away. Get away!
I whooped you! I whooped you all!
You'll think twice before messing with Percival C. McLeach!
No!
Don't give up, Cody!
There!
Hop on, Miss B!
Help! Help!
It's okay.
Come on.
Thanks, little mate.
Oh, Bernard, you are magnificent.
You are absolutely the hero of the day.
Miss Bianca, before anything else happens,
- will you marry me?
- Bernard.
Of course, I will!
Well done, mate.
Come on, Marahute, let's all go home.
Help!
Anybody!
Bernard!
Bianca!
Where are you?
Okay, that's it, I'm out of here.
This is ridiculous.
You can't leave me here alone.
I'm gone! I am gone.
No, stay in those eggs!
That's a direct order!
Oh.
Hey, you're kind of a cute little feller. Coochy, coochy...
Come, sorrow.
We welcome thee.
Let us join in grief, rejoice in despair and honor the fortunate dead.
Dearly beloved.
Shh!
Good show, old man.
Gomez.
Cara mia?
Marvelous news.
I'm going to have a baby right now.
Nurse, how close are the contractions?
Every 15 seconds, Doctor.
Are you in unbearable pain?
Is it inhuman?
My darling, is it torture?
Oui.
And then Mommy kissed
Daddy, and the angel told the stork and the stork flew down from heaven and left a diamond under a leaf in the cabbage patch and the diamond turned into a baby.
Our parents are having a baby, too.
They had sex.
Push, Mrs. Addams.
- Forceps!
- Forceps.
Forceps.
Mrs. Addams, would you like anesthesia?
No, thank you.
But do ask the children.
Cara mia.
Mon cher.
Mrs. Addams, the baby?
Pardon.
- It's a boy.
- It's a girl.
- Gomez!
- What news?
Father, what is it?
It's an Addams!
I've arranged a little surprise, my dearest.
I hope you like it.
Oh, Gomez, it's dark, it's depressing, it's desolate.
- It says, "toddler."
- It's a dream.
Come,cara mia.
The Addams' cradle.
Welcome home, my son.
That's not true.
It is so.
Everyone knows it.
When you have a new baby, one of the other children has to die.
- Really?
- It's a tradition.
One of us has to go.
Which one?
Well, they only need one boy.
He has my father's eyes.
Gomez, take those out of his mouth.
A baby in the house.
It's about time.
Hey, kiddo.
Did you see that?
He's a real devil.
Pugsley, the baby weighs
10 pounds.
The cannonball weighs 20 pounds.
Which will hit the stone walkway first?
- I'm still on fractions.
- Which do you think?
The cannonball?
Very good.
But which one will bounce?
The baby?
There's only one way to find out.
Ready?
One, two, three.
What a glorious evening.
Rain.
Cara mia.
Oh, dear.
Children, why do you hate the baby?
We don't hate him.
We just want to play with him.
Especially his head.
Children, do you think we love the baby more than we love you?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Do you think that when a new baby arrives one of the other children has to die?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Well, that's just not true.
Not anymore.
It's just sibling rivalry.
Gomez, do you remember what we were like?
- I hated you!
- I despised you.
I choked him until he lost consciousness and had to be put on a respirator.
I tied him to a tree and pulled out four of his permanent teeth.
When he was asleep,
I opened his skull and removed his brains.
You did?
Brother!
Brother!
Children, you see?
"Death! Death to the enemies of the people of the Republic."
Hurrah!
Justice is served.
Bring forward the evil one.
You have betrayed the people of France.
You are evil incarnate.
How do you plead?
Guilty.
Guilty by her own admission.
The sentence is death.
Executioner, place her on the block.
One, two...
Children, what are you doing in there?
- Playing!
- Playing!
Three!
Woe to the Republic.
Look at you.
Midnight, moonlight, surrounded by death.
It's been too long.
Do it!
Hold him still!
You missed.
Here, catch!
I don't want him!
One house, three children.
So many windows.
My darling, it's you I'm worried about.
The stress, all this squabbling.
Oh, I'll be fine.
I'm just like any modern woman trying to have it all.
Loving husband, a family.
It's just I wish
I had more time to seek out the dark forces and join their hellish crusade.
That's all.
You can. You shall.
So it must be.
But how?
Children, as your new nanny,
I know that we're all concerned about the environment.
So, this morning, let's discuss how to prevent forest fires.
Prevent them?
All right, children,
I've had it up to here.
Now you just answer one simple question.
Where is that baby?
Which part?
Hello, kiddies.
I'm Polly the puppet.
What shall we do today?
I know.
Let's all clean our rooms.
Hello, Polly.
I'll clean my room in exchange for your immortal soul.
Hi. Addams residence?
Ooh. It's old.
And big.
Lurch.
Hi! Hi. I'm Debbie
Jellinsky from the agency.
The agency?
But they claimed no one else was available.
They suggested a Doberman.
Surprise!
I've been out of town.
Are you the mom?
I am Mrs. Addams.
I love your dress.
It's so tight.
Thank you.
Gomez.
I believe we may have a new nanny,
Miss Jellinsky.
Deb.
Isn't he a lady-killer?
Acquitted.
I can show you all my references so you know
I'm not a homicidal maniac.
- Of course you're not.
- You're too young.
Welcome to our home.
There's a belfry, a swamp and the dungeon down below.
- Cable?
- Of course.
Debbie.
Oh, is that the little critter?
Oh, no.
This is our baby.
He's adorable. He's perfect.
What's his name?
It was agony.
We went through all the books, all the usual baby names.
- Lucifer.
- Benito.
Mao.
And then we came to our senses.
Something simple, something a child could live with.
Pubert.
Pubert.
I like it.
It's filthy.
May I?
Your dress, is it flammable?
You've had your shots, measles, mumps, rabies?
Oh!
Oh, I just adore little babies.
I just want to grab 'em and squeeze 'em till there's not a breath left in their tiny, little bodies.
Hello, Pubert.
I love you.
Children, this is Miss
Jellinsky, our new nanny.
What do we say?
Be afraid.
Be very afraid.
Look at you, all cooped up in this house with a new baby.
That's not easy, is it?
No.
Why, I bet sometimes you wish it was still just the two of you.
Or less.
Well, don't you worry.
Everything's going to be just fine.
I love them.
Thing, stop that.
He likes you.
I'm good with my hands.
What a wonderful family.
Although there's one fellow
I haven't met yet.
Hi, there, mister.
- Your nephew?
- My brother.
- No!
- Fester, come out here.
He's very shy.
Fester, this is Miss
Jellinsky, our new nanny.
Hello, Fester.
These Addams men, where do you find them?
It has to be damp.
I can't wait.
I'll start first thing tomorrow.
Why not tonight?
Good night, Debbie.
Good night!
Scream if you need anything.
So we've hired
Miss Jellinsky.
- She's a gem, don't you think?
- She's perfect.
Oh, Fester,
I'm such a lucky man.
I hope that someday you'll know the indescribable joy of having children, and of paying someone else to raise them.
But first, wouldn't I have to get married?
Oh, but you're just a boy.
There's plenty of time.
You'll meet someone, someone very special.
- Someone who won't press charges.
- Oh, I'd like that.
You rascal.
Oh!
And what's this?
- Mom.
- Mom.
Tonight on America's Most
Disgusting Unsolved Crimes
we investigate the case of Ursula,
Carmen
and Nadine.
Three very different women with one thing in common.
Murder!
And they're all the same woman.
She's known by the police as a black widow.
She mates, then she kills.
She investigates wealthy men,
finding the richest, loneliest bachelors,
gaining their trust and their love
and finally she marries them.
Then on the wedding night, she kills them.
The deaths appear accidental.
Then after the funeral, she disappears, cash in hand.
But the money never lasts,
and soon the black widow is hungry again.
Hungry for cash, hungry for love.
A mistress of disguise, she has eluded the authorities for years.
Who is she,
and what seemingly innocent pose will she next assume?
All we can say is,
bachelors, beware.
We'll be going out for most of the morning.
All the important numbers, police, fire department, morgue.
Fester, come along!
Goodbye, Fester.
Say goodbye to Debbie.
Have fun!
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
Fester Addams. My, my.
Stocks and bonds, deeds, gold bullion.
Treasury bills,
IRAs.
What a strange, old house.
It's so drafty.
It's really no place for children.
No place at all.
Hold still, you little brat.
He's not a brat.
Of course not.
He's an adorable, little baby.
Fine. Rub it in.
We're getting him all ready for a nice, little walk.
Would you like to come?
Are you really a nanny?
What a question.
Why did you come here?
Why, to take care of you, all of you.
Especially my uncle?
I shouldn't be telling you this.
They swore me to secrecy, the little angels.
But they want to go.
It's all they talked about all morning.
They're just afraid to ask you.
They're afraid you'll think that they don't love you.
The poor things.
- It is a bizarre request.
- It's horrifying.
They have their hearts set on it.
I knew you'd want to know as concerned, caring parents.
Oh, Gomez, what shall we do?
How can we say no?
Don't even mention it to them.
Just do it.
I'm sure they'll deny everything, but they want to go.
God love 'em.
- Summer camp.
- Summer camp.
Camp Chippewa.
How charming.
What's a Chippewa?
It's an old
Indian word.
It means orphan.
Fresh air, the scent of pine.
Wednesday, look at all of the other children, their freckles, their bright, little eyes, their eager, friendly smiles.
Help them.
Hi. I'm Amanda Buckman.
Why are you dressed like that?
Like what?
Like you're going to a funeral.
Why are you dressed like somebody died?
Wait.
Hi. Don Buckman.
Isn't this place something else?
Very exclusive.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
A kid has to be extra special to get in here.
Gifted, exceptional.
Our Amanda's already skipped two grades.
How about your boy?
Probation.
We just love Chippewa.
Amanda couldn't wait.
It's all she talked about.
She's got a whole new wardrobe.
And this little lady?
Oh, Wednesday's at that very special age when a girl has only one thing on her mind.
Boys?
Homicide.
Attention!
Hey, listen up, everybody.
I'm Gary Granger!
And I'm
Becky Martin-Granger.
We're the owners and directors here at Camp Chippewa,
America's foremost facility for privileged young adults!
And we're all here to learn, to grow and to just plain have fun!
'Cause that's what being privileged is all about.
- Buffy!
- Debbie!
I'm fine. How are you?
How are you doing?
Mom, I don't... I don't think I like it here.
Oh, will you stop already?
Do you know how dirty you are?
Selma, please leave him alone.
I can't breathe.
Oh, stop it, Joel, please.
Now stand up straight.
This is why he's sick all the time.
Oh, Dell, don't start with me on that, please.
This is it, you did this.
This has nothing to do with allergies.
You did this.
You did this.
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?
Stand up straight.
Stand up straight.
"Everyone at the ball
"turned and stared at Cinderella.
"'Who is that beautiful woman?', everyone asked.
"Even Prince Charming noticed the new arrival.
"'Who are you?, ' he asked Cinderella.
"'My name is Cinderella, ' she said to the prince.
"'Could you tell me,
"'who is that man over by the punch bowl?'"
"That fascinating man,
"that oddly sensual man.
"That man who makes me quiver under my bodice.
"That bald man."
She's driving me wild!
- Who?
- Debbie!
Debbie.
Even the sound of her name.
Debbie.
Isn't it beautiful?
She makes me think of vinyl.
Chemicals!
Truly, Fester, has it finally happened at long last?
I don't know.
I think so.
All these years
I've watched you and Morticia through windows, doorways, keyholes.
I've been so happy for you.
But I have to confess,
I've been jealous, too.
I've dreamed that sometime maybe there might be someone for me.
- There's Thing.
- Oh, I know, I know.
But I want more!
Legs, elbows, a head.
Two legs?
Dare I...
Dare I ask
Debbie to dinner?
What if she says no?
What if she says yes?
Oh, Gomez, if I asked her, would you come?
- You and Morticia.
- Of course.
Lifesaving.
Now I know we're all top-notch, little swimmers, but now we get to show our stuff and earn those certificates!
Hey, how about our first little pair of lifesaving buddies?
Amanda, Wednesday.
Is that your bathing suit?
Is that your overbite?
Now one of you will be the drowning victim, and the other one gets to be our lifesaver.
I'll be the victim.
All your life.
I'm going to be an actress.
Brava!
Now, Amanda, jump in, swim out a few yards and start drowning.
Help me! Help me!
I'm drowning! Help me!
I'm dying!
I can't swim.
It's our favorite bistro.
We've been coming here for years.
Of course, it has been redone.
Oh, it's just lovely.
Isn't it, Fester?
Fester.
It's a quaint
French custom, sharing half-eaten bread.
Fester is truly continental.
He spent many years abroad.
He speaks 12 languages fluently.
I could tell.
You know, when I first saw him,
I thought he was from Europe.
- You did?
- It's true.
But I took a bath.
Fester's really a wonderful man.
He's just terribly shy.
Really, I just can't tell.
Does he like me at all?
Of course, he does.
He vomited.
That's true.
Does he always do that with women he likes?
Oh, no. Just you.
Do you think she minded?
Of course not.
She adores you.
Ugh! I'm making such a mess of things.
Gomez, how do you do it?
How can I be like you?
How can I be suave?
Woo her, admire her.
Make her feel like she's the most sublime creature on earth.
Yes. That's it?
We're back.
Noses powdered.
Perfection achieved.
We are the luckiest brothers on earth.
We are unworthy of such splendor, undeserving of such radiance.
That's right.
We should have ugly girls.
And then the ghost said,
"And I will haunt you forever."
Wednesday, you have to continue the ghost story.
This is dumb.
Well, if you can't do it...
And so the next night, the ghost returned to the haunted cabin, and he said to the campers,
"None of you really believe in me,
"so I'll have to prove my power."
And the next morning, when the campers woke up, all of their old noses had grown back.
Oh, Fester, how you must hate me.
What?
Here you are, a debonair man of the world.
How I must bore you.
Oh, never.
Fester, before we go any further,
I have a confession, something I must tell you.
I'm a virgin.
- You are?
- Yes.
What's that?
It-it's someone who's never experienced physical love.
Oh...
You mean, with another person.
Then, Debbie,
I have a confession to make as well.
I'm one, too.
You? You?
Yes.
But with your looks, your charm, women must follow you everywhere.
Store detectives.
Oh, Fester.
I always dreamed of meeting someone untouched, someone pure, someone just like you.
You'll meet him.
And... And I dreamed that when I met him, that we would wait until our wedding night to give ourselves to one another, to make the ultimate sacrifice.
A goat?
Until now I thought it was impossible.
But, Fester Addams,
I love you.
You do?
Please, be brutally honest.
I have to know how you feel about me.
I love you.
I worship you.
I'd do anything for you.
I'd pay.
Fester!
Debbie!
Look at him.
So peaceful.
This evening as I watched
Fester and Debbie,
I kept my fingers crossed.
- I hoped.
- I prayed.
Let them fall in love.
Let them know happiness.
Let them adopt.
Gomez, Morticia, great news.
Something impossible, a miracle.
- The rash!
- It's gone.
I'm engaged.
- That ring.
- It was our mother's.
She was buried with it.
Mail call!
- Addams.
- Barkley, Castleman,
Calloway, Dexter, Donman,
Edwards, Evans,
Finley, Fisher,
Framingham...
- Oh, no.
- What is it?
This is unspeakable.
Is something wrong,
Wednesday?
Bad news?
This is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of human events.
Uncle Fester is getting married.
A wedding?
But that's great news.
To whom?
The nanny.
Get out of the cabin.
I mean, I'll kill myself.
The help?
I'm sure she's a very nice lady.
I think that's disgusting.
I think their whole family's like some weird medical experiment.
I think they're like circus people.
- What did you say?
- Tempers!
Group hug.
Wednesday,
Pugsley, will a hug hurt us?
We don't hug.
Oh! They're just shy.
- We're not shy.
- We're contagious.
I'm sensing some friction here, something not quite Chippewa.
But, hey, no problemo.
All they need are good friends, good fun and a little time in the harmony hut.
How long do we have to stay in here?
Until we crack.
Have fun.
What are you in for?
I wouldn't go horseback riding.
That's all?
And I wouldn't make a bird house.
Why not?
I just wanted to read.
Not on my time, four eyes.
Hurry up.
I'm coming.
- Wait.
- Who's there?
Be careful. Tetanus.
There they are! I saw them sneak out.
Children, what do you think you're doing?
We have to see our family.
It's very important.
More important than a summer of fun?
More important than making new friends?
More important than sharing?
And, Joel Glicker,
I'm surprised at you.
I-I have to get out of here.
I have allergies.
Oh, you're allergic?
To sunshine and archery and crafts?
Yes.
I think they should be punished.
Punished!
Punished! Punished!
Punished! Punished!
No! No!
We are not here to punish.
We are here to inspire.
Campers, do you know what I think our little ninja friends here need?
Do you know what just might turn their sad and potentially wasted little lives right on around?
What?
âª Kumbaya, my Lord
âª Kumbaya
âª Kumbaya, my Lord
âª Kumbaya
âª Kumbaya, my Lord
âª Kumbaya
âª Oh Lord, kumbaya âª
Now, Debbie, have you met everyone?
- Morticia.
- Margaret.
Margaret, this is our bride-to-be.
Welcome to our family.
I can't tell you what it's meant to me joining the Addams clan.
Have you met my husband,
Cousin Itt?
Cousin Itt?
We've been so happy.
And just as little
Pubert arrived, we were blessed with our own little bundle of joy.
What.
Oh, I didn't say anything.
No, that's the baby's nickname, What.
From the obstetrician.
Isn't he precious?
We've had offers.
âª For he's a jolly good fellow
âª Which nobody can deny âª
You guys are the best bunch of friends a fellow could hope for.
What a party!
And now, for the piece de resistance!
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
That poor girl.
Lurch, was she in there before you baked?
C'est la vie.
Are you really allergic?
Uh-huh.
To almost everything.
- No, you're not.
- Am, too.
I can't have dairy products, or wear wool, or drink fluoridated water.
Do you know what happens if my mom uses a fabric softener?
What?
I die.
Where are you?
Over here.
Where?
By the skeleton.
I-I got your message inside my cutlet.
I need to ask you something.
What?
Do you believe in the existence of evil?
Well, did you meet my mom?
My uncle Fester's about to get married to this woman in a white uniform.
A radiologist.
A nanny.
But I have to go to the wedding.
I have a pass.
Do you want to come?
You mean, like, on a date?
No.
I'd love to.
I, Fester Addams, do hereby declare my unending love.
I will worship you forever.
I will devote my every waking moment to your happiness alone.
Oh!
Henceforth,
I am your eternal and helpless slave.
Nice.
Ditto.
You're going to have a wonderful life together.
Yes, I am.
Come, darling, let's see who's the next happy bride.
Come on!
Here, Debbie!
To me!
To me! Me!
- I have it!
- No, I have it!
- No! I have it!
- It's mine! I got it!
Now you have to get married.
- It's not binding.
- Tramp.
Bye!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Bon voyage!
The key ingredient to a successful
Hawaiian honeymoon is romantic music.
I ordered this cassette from Time Life.
5,000 of the world's most romantic melodies.
It's superb.
What do you call this?
Number 438.
So, do you like romantic living?
I do, so far.
I love romantic living.
Oh, Fester, how much do you love me?
With all my soul.
Would you do anything for me?
Anything.
Would you die for me?
Yes.
Promise?
Pumpkin?
Muffin.
Darling,
I know you're nervous.
So am I.
I'm not nervous.
I'm upset.
Because of the bathtub?
That was an accident.
I know.
- I'm fine.
- I know.
Don't give it another thought.
Don't be frightened.
This is as new to me as it is to you.
Have you really never had sex?
Never.
Well, then how do you know we're not having it right now?
Sweetheart, we'll be just like Gomez and Morticia.
Pretend we're at home in my room,
Granny down the hallway,
Lurch by the door.
Oh, my God.
Please, what is it?
What do you need?
Only you, my dearest.
Really?
Fester, I'm ready.
Just one thing.
Gomez told me.
No giggling.
- And?
- No hand puppets.
- And?
- What?
After we've made love, you can never see your family again.
What?
Otherwise,
I could never really enjoy myself.
I could never give myself completely.
Unless I never see my family again?
Yes. If I picture them in our lives,
I could never achieve, you know.
Never?
Don't you love me?
Of course.
Don't you want me?
Yes.
Never?
Stud.
It's so odd we haven't heard from Fester and Debbie.
It's been almost a week.
Hasn't it, little fellow?
Look at him.
Too much fun at that reception.
Hair of the pup.
Excellent, Amanda!
Thank you.
Next!
"Dear Wednesday and Pugsley,
"I love you dearly but I can never see you again."
Glicker, go!
Good try!
"When you are grown up and very lonely,
"you will understand.
Love, Uncle Fester."
He's a dead man.
Go!
It's an American bald eagle!
But aren't they extinct?
They are now.
- Mrs. Addams?
- Yes?
Your hearse, ma'am.
Where's the body?
- He's right there.
- But he's alive.
Tell me about it!
Fester, we may be together for a while.
All our lives,cara mia.
- What?
- Mon cher.
- Speak English.
- Pumpkin.
And if I have to be seen with you, we need to make some changes.
Changes?
Be careful!
It's a credenza!
These are beautiful things.
They're from catalogs.
Fester, get over here!
It itches.
Don't touch it, not until the scab falls off.
Pumpkin, do you think these clothes are really me?
Of course not.
That's the point.
Ma'am, where do you want this thing?
The second floor boudoir.
And be careful.
- I'm her husband.
- Fester!
Give me a kiss.
Give me a 20.
Watch it!
That's a Queen Anne chandelier!
"Hawaii is wonderful.
"I wish you were here and I can never see you again!
"PS, Debbie says hi."
I don't understand.
For weeks not a word, and now this.
Darling, come to bed.
He can't be serious.
Have I done something, said something?
Why does my brother despise me?
He adores you.
I'd do anything for him.
At his request,
I would rip out my eyes.
At his command,
I would crawl on my belly through hot coals and broken glass.
Why wait?
Has Fester gone mad?
This is all just some sort of phase.
Post-honeymoon malaise.
It's very common.
Do you remember our honeymoon?
That glorious cruise.
No calls.
No cares.
No survivors.
Cara mia.
So, you still desire me after all these years?
The old ball and chain?
Forever.
I'll get them.
Heads up, campers!
Jamboree's only two weeks away, and you know what that means.
Clean cabins.
Creating with clay.
And canoes, canoes, canoes!
So we better get cracking, huh?
'Cause it's gonna be one...
Look at this.
I got them.
Schizos and serial killers.
I have almost the whole series.
I'm only missing Jack the
Ripper and that Zodiac guy.
But look.
"The Black Widow."
It might be Debbie.
At least three rich husbands, all dead.
- I'll trade you.
- For what?
Amy Fisher.
Each year, we conclude our summer with a very special presentation.
Book, music and lyrics by...
Gary Granger!
And this year, the old bean has come up with something pretty exciting.
My own personal salute to the first Thanksgiving.
Now we have thought long and hard about choosing just the right little actress for the leading role of Sarah Miller, our beautiful and kindly pilgrim lady.
And we have selected
Amanda Buckman!
And in the roles of her pilgrim pals,
Lily, Jennifer, Tiffany, Missy, Michelle and Melissa!
But, of course, not everyone can be a star.
No.
Let's not forget our cheery, little Chippewas,
Mordecai, Yang,
Esther, um...
Consuela, Irwin and, um...
I'm still not sure just how to pronounce this.
Jamil? Jamel?
Jamal.
Whatever.
And as their leader in the secondary, but still compellingly written role of Pocahontas, guess who we have in mind?
Our own little brunette outcast,
Wednesday Addams.
We want to see
Debbie and Fester.
Miss Debbie!
Debra!
Gomez, where are we?
It looks familiar.
Of course, the gates of hell.
Welcome to my home.
Might we see my brother?
No. He doesn't want to see you, any of you or that.
Why not?
Because he's in love.
He's wrapped in a gossamer blanket of ecstasy, and he hates your guts.
But why?
Because you flaunted yourselves, your great love affair.
You kept him a child.
I've made him a man.
Let me hear this from his own lips.
His lips are busy.
- You want to talk to these people?
- Debbie.
Go away!
That is not my brother!
- Sorry.
- You have enslaved him.
You have placed Fester under some strange sexual spell.
I respect that.
But, please, may we see him?
Don't even think about it.
You have gone too far.
You have married Fester, you have destroyed his spirit, you have taken him from us.
All that I could forgive, but, Debbie...
What?
Pastels?
Get out of my house!
Hit the road!
And if you ever show your faces around here again,
I'll have you locked up for trying to visit.
Right, Fessie?
Right!
Luxor, nexor, burst and burn!
What is she doing?
Just a curse.
Have a nice day.
I demand justice!
Someone has married my brother.
No.
She took him to Hawaii.
Get out of here.
They have moved into a large, expensive home where they make love constantly.
I hate when that happens.
Arrest her at once without delay.
- Who?
- Debbie.
My brother's wife, the temptress of Waikiki.
Who are you? What are you?
Who moved the rock?
Officer, you must issue a subpoena.
I believe they own...
- Gomez, no!
- ...A Buick!
Just leave.
Leave quietly. Leave now.
Don't make me call
Ringling Brothers.
Has the planet gone mad?
My brother, passion's hostage!
I seek justice!
Denied!
I shall not submit!
I shall conquer! I shall rise!
My name is Gomez Addams, and I have seen evil!
I have seen horror!
I have seen the unholy maggots which feast in the dark recesses of the human soul!
They're at camp.
I have seen all this, Officer.
But until today,
I had never seen you!
Hook him, book him, cook him. Now!
Next in line.
Yes, I'd like to renew my passport, please.
I'll be leaving the country very shortly.
Will you be traveling alone?
Yes. I'll be a widow.
âª Happy, happy turkey day
âª Hunger pains will go away
âª When you hear the pilgrims say
âª It's happy turkey day
âª Happy, happy turkey day
âª Let's all eat the Indian way
âª As Bastille and Cape Cod day
âª On happy turkey day âª
Look at you.
Oh, Amanda, you look perfect!
You're just the prettiest pilgrim I've ever seen!
Gar, come and take a look at this.
Here they are!
We caught them by the pay phone.
We were calling the FBI.
Their uncle is in trouble.
We were running a check.
And you are late for your fittings.
I don't want to be in the pageant.
Don't you wanna help me realize my vision?
Your work is puerile and under-dramatized.
You lack any sense of structure, character or the Aristotelian unities.
Young lady, I am getting just a tad tired of your attitude problem.
Everyone, campers!
I have a wonderful idea.
Wednesday and Pugsley and young Mr. Glicker here, well, they have just never quite latched on to the Chippewa spirit, nor have some of their little comrades.
Isn't that sad?
Yes!
Don't we just hate that?
Yes!
Don't we wish they would just die?
Yes!
Oh, no, we don't.
But you know what we're gonna do with them?
We're going to make an example.
We are going to show that anyone, no matter how odd, or pale or chubby, can still have a darn good time.
Whether they like it or not.
What are you gonna do?
Yes, indeedy.
Just the ticket.
Bambi.
Lassie Come Home.
The Little Mermaid.
- Stop it.
- He's only a child.
Don't worry.
We're getting out of here.
But, it's Disney.
Yes.
âª The hills are alive
âª With the sound of music
âª With songs they have sung
âª For a thousand years âª
âª And they knew that it was much more than a hunch
âª That this group must somehow form a family
âª That's the way we all became
The Brady Bunch âª
âª You're always a day
âª Away âª
Well, good evening.
Is there anything you'd like to say to everyone?
Yes.
And just what might that be?
I'm not perky.
That's for damn sure.
But I want to be.
You do?
I want to smile and sing and dance and be Pocahontas in Gary's vision.
Oh, darling, do you really mean it?
Isn't she pretty?
She's scaring me!
- Gar.
- Yeah.
Stay back!
He's very sick.
My baby!
Lumbar, dison, pox and thither, curad, brattle, bone and brine!
Bone and brine!
Well, he's stubborn.
It works on cats.
- What are we going to do?
- Is it hopeless?
Here it is.
"Chapter 18.
Infant possessions."
He's possessed?
"Warning signs,
"severe alterations in appearance and personality.
"Such alterations can become permanent."
Permanent?
Those golden curls?
Those rosy cheeks?
That smile?
"These terrifying changes are most often the result
"of a troubled family life.
"Separations..."
- Separations? You mean...
- Fester!
Bingo!
This kid knows that something is not right around here.
Unless Fester comes back, we're talking dimples.
Not in this house.
He could stay this way for years. Forever.
He could become a lawyer.
I won't listen!
An orthodontist.
Mama, stop!
President.
Please! I beg you, take me!
Each summer we take this occasion
to celebrate a seminal event in American history.
This year, we depict perhaps the most important day in our shared past, the first Thanksgiving!
A day for maize, the Native American word for corn,
a terrific turkey dinner
and brotherhood!
So white meat and dark meat,
take it away!
âª Eat us
âª Hey, it's Thanksgiving day
âª Eat us, we make a nice buffet
âª We lost the race with Farmer Ed
âª Eat us
'cause we're good and dead
âª White man or red man
âª From East, North or South
âª Chop off our legs
âª And put 'em in your mouth
âª Eat me
âª Sauteed or barbecued
âª Eat me
âª We once were pets, but now we're food
âª We won't stay fresh for very long
âª So eat us before we finish this song
âª Eat us before we finish this song âª
Thank you.
It was a senseless tragedy.
Angel, I'm going out for just a minute.
I forgot the champagne.
Our three-week anniversary!
I'll go.
No, no.
You're working hard enough.
I'll just put your present on the table.
Don't peek!
Please, please!
What is it?
Is it string?
You never know.
Is it a dog toy?
Just you wait.
It's a bomb.
What?
Oh, I know.
Wait for my birthday.
Fester, let me look at you.
I want to remember you just this way.
What do you mean?
Rich.
Will you miss me?
But you'll be right back, won't you?
Of course.
I am so glad we invited the Chippewas to join us for this holiday meal.
Remember, these savages are our guests.
We must not be surprised at any of their strange customs.
After all, they have not had our advantages, such as fine schools, libraries full of books, shampoo.
How.
I am Pocahontas, a Chippewa maiden.
An Indian.
Enough said.
And I am Running Bear, betrothed to Pocahontas.
In the play.
20 grand for summer camp, he's Mr. Woo Woo.
We have brought a special gift for this holiday feast.
I am a turkey. Kill me.
What a thoughtful gift!
Why, you are as civilized as we, except we wear shoes and have last names.
Welcome to our table, our new primitive friends.
Thank you, Sarah Miller.
You're the most beautiful person I've ever seen.
Your hair is the color of the sun.
Your skin is like fresh milk, and everyone loves you.
Stop! Sit.
- Wait.
- What?
We cannot break bread with you.
Huh?
Becky, what's going on?
Wednesday.
You have taken the land which is rightfully ours.
Years from now, my people will be forced to live in mobile homes on reservations.
Your people will wear cardigans and drink highballs.
We will sell our bracelets by the roadsides.
You will play golf and enjoy hot hors d'oeuvres.
My people will have pain and degradation.
Your people will have stick shifts.
The gods of my tribe have spoken.
They have said,
"Do not trust the pilgrims,
"especially Sarah Miller."
Gary, she's changing the words.
And for all these reasons,
I have decided to scalp you and burn your village to the ground.
Children!
Campers!
Stop it!
You're destroying my text!
He's not a team player.
Well, he's a special child, but he needs friends.
He needs friends like this?
Uh, I beg your pardon.
Do something!
âª Macho, macho man
âª I've got to be a macho man
âª Macho, macho man
âª I've got to be a macho!
âª Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Wait!
What time is it, Jorge?
Oops! Got to go.
- No! No!
- Wait!
Wait here. It's my anniversary.
I'll be right back.
Oh, your husband is a very lucky man.
Don't say that!
âª Macho, macho man
âª I've got to be a macho man! âª
Cheers.
No, no.
And, Officer, my husband was in that house.
Happy anniversary, Debbie.
Help. Help.
Sweetheart!
Did you get the champagne?
Freeze!
Pookie?
I tried to make it look like an accident.
I tried to give you some dignity.
But, oh, no. Not you.
What are you saying?
I'm saying, I want you dead, and I want your money.
But... But...
Don't you love me?
Is that a no?
Do I love you?
Look at yourself!
You're a nightmare!
You're the missing link!
You shouldn't be married!
You should be studied!
You're a big, dumb, weird thing!
No woman in her right mind could love you!
Thing!
I'll get you!
And your little hand, too!
Come on.
No. I have to go back.
For the others.
You're very brave.
And to watch the place burn.
You go.
Save your uncle.
Joel, I may never see you again.
I know.
There are forces tearing us apart,
Gary, Debbie, seventh grade.
I'll never forget you.
You won't?
You're too weird.
We'll always have today and Chippewa.
And this.
What is it?
Amanda's retainer.
Cara mia.
Mon cher.
Come on!
Move it!
Move out of the way!
"We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
"We looked! And we saw him!
"The Cat in the Hat!"
Are you enjoying this?
To think, a child of mine.
"I know it is wet, and the sun is not sunny,
"but we can have lots of good fun that is funny."
Oh, no.
He lives.
Come on! It's Gomez!
âª Swing low
âª Sweet chariot
âª Comin' for to carry me home!
âª Swing low âª
My baby is ill, and my husband is dying.
Oh, Mama, what shall I do?
Well, you have a black dress.
Gomez!
- Fester!
- Fester!
Fester? Where is Fester?
He's right here,mon cher.
It's me, Gomez.
I've tried to be someone I'm not.
I live in shame and the suburbs!
But you belong to Debbie.
You're Debbie's love toy.
You are Mr. Debbie!
I am an Addams!
Fester!
Uncle Fester!
Children!
You sent us to camp.
They made us sing.
My own dear family.
How I've missed you all.
Our whole family, together at last.
Three generations above ground.
In-laws!
I don't want to hurt anybody.
I don't enjoy hurting anybody.
I don't like guns, or bombs, or electric chairs.
But sometimes people just won't listen, and so I have to use persuasion and slides.
My parents, Sharon and Dave.
Generous, doting, or were they?
All I ever wanted was a Ballerina Barbie in her pretty pink tutu.
My birthday.
I was 10, and do you know what they got me?
Malibu Barbie.
The nightmare.
The nerve.
That's not what I wanted.
That's not who I was.
I was a ballerina.
Graceful, delicate.
They had to go.
My first husband, the heart surgeon.
All day long, coronaries, transplants.
What about your needs?
"Sorry about dinner, Deb.
The Pope has a cold."
An axe.
That takes me back.
Husband number two, the senator.
He loved his state.
He loved his country.
What about Debbie?
"Sorry, Debbie.
No Mercedes this year.
"We have to set an example."
Oh, yeah? Set this!
My latest husband.
My late husband, Fester.
The fool.
The corpse.
And his adorable family.
You took me in.
You accepted me.
But did any of you love me?
Really love me?
Hands.
So I... I killed.
So I maimed.
So I destroyed one innocent life after another.
Aren't I a human being?
Don't I yearn and ache and shop?
Don't I deserve love and jewelry?
Adieu, mon cher.
Adios, cara mia.
Debbie, let them go.
Take me and my money.
For what I've done,
I deserve to die.
Sorry.
Goodbye, everybody.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
A birthday party!
What a treat!
And to think
I might have missed all this.
What was I thinking of?
Physical pleasure.
Uncle Fester, do you miss Debbie?
Well, sometimes, late at night.
I remember how she used to turn to me and say,
"Jesus, Fester, go back to your room."
Yoo-hoo.
Are we late?
Not at all.
We're just getting started.
I hope no one minds.
We brought along a guest.
This is our new nanny,
Dementia.
Dementia.
What a beautiful name.
It means insanity.
My name's Fester.
It means to rot.
A toast.
To the glorious mysteries of life.
To all that binds a family as one.
To mirth, to merriment, to manslaughter.
Hear, hear.
To dear friends.
To new friends.
To youth.
- How do I look?
- Disturbing.
To passion.
To paradise.
To pain.
Tonight.
Make way for the birthday boy!
Thing, will you do the honors?
Your family is really interesting.
Your parents are so involved with each other.
Wednesday, do you think, like, maybe someday you might want to get married and have kids?
No.
But what if you met just the right man who worshiped and adored you, who'd do anything for you, who'd be your devoted slave?
Then what would you do?
I'd pity him.
Poor Debbie.
She was sick.
She wasn't sick.
She was sloppy.
What do you mean?
If I wanted to kill my husband,
I'd do it, and I wouldn't get caught.
How?
I'd scare him to death.
No, you wouldn't.
We're all very sorry, Debbie.
We wish you only the best.

''The day I got Punisher, the masterpiece of my coIIection.
''AIso, I got the first hoIogram card.
''I'm Iooking for the originaI card of WoIverine.''
Very good, EmiIy. Sam.
''JFK. There was once a man named JFK
''who aIways wanted to be good and do what was right.
''JFK was eIected President of the United States in 1960.''
''I have a magic cupboard with a magic key.
''I put a pIastic Indian in the cupboard and he came aIive.
''He is a reaI Iroquois man.
''He taIks. He eats. He trusts me.''
That's very interesting.
Good imagination.
Your house is fantastic.
It wiII do. It is agreeabIe.
I Iearned a Iot about you today.
Good. Tonight, I wiII hunt for food and we wiII cook meat and we wiII teII stories.
You teII aII about me.
LittIe Bear?
- Do you keep the man, Omri?
- Just the bow and arrow.
Can I watch?
He is Mohawk.
It is an exceIIent bow.
It's aII right.
It's OK.
No... LittIe Bear?
- He is dead.
- He's dead? I kiIIed him?
He is oId. His days are done.
- We must bury him.
- Bury him? Us? Here?
Yes. You never had a dead man here?
Do peopIe die here?
- PeopIe die. We just don't see them.
- How do you not see them?
Come down here, pIease.
Can't I just send him back?
You are afraid of him?
A dead man?
You are a chiId. Yes, send him back.
- What if he was aIone?
- Then he is aIone!
Where were you?
Guiding my nephew through the woods to Iive aIone and Iearn to be a man.
You shouId not do magic you do not understand!
Omri, now!
Send him back.
He wouId want to be back.
Are you mad at me?
What did you do with them?
- I buried them.
- My saw bIades? Why?
Those are my things.
I work with them. I need them.
What do you want me do to?
We'II go to Yapp's and buy a set.
Come on.
I can go aIone. It's a bIock away.
You don't need to go with me
Iike I'm a baby.
I've been before.
You just didn't know.
What did you get? Let me see.
What is this junk? Give me the money.
You! Come back!
You don't deserve that hair!
Look. I got this guy to go with your Indian.
Patrick. Omri? Are you OK?
Omri, are you sure you're OK?
- This thing is incredibIe.
- Get your hands out of the way.
Where do you think he got this?
Look how smaII it is.
- What are you Iooking at?
- This is incredibIe.
How did you make this?
Don't bring that rat in here.
I found him in here, Beavis, and my figures and my magnifying gIass.
- What eIse do you have that's mine?
- That thing was in here?
This is great. Dad shouId see this.
I want you both to Ieave my room now.
Jeez, temperamentaI.
- You got to promise me...
- What?
LittIe Bear, where are you?
What are we Iooking for?
Here!
It's aII right. You can come out.
- I heard them and I ran.
- That was good.
- They are enemies?
- Brothers.
Brothers?
Those brothers took my house!
I am in the dark here.
Send me back. I want to go back.
But I brought my friend to meet you.
Patrick, LittIe Bear.
Another Great Spirit?
Make another IittIe man?
No. No more men.
- LittIe Bear, wiII you come out?
- No. You come in.
- This is the pIastic Indian?
- Not pIastic any more.
- How did you do that?
- The cupboard.
Show me.
Put a pIastic thing in and Iock it.
If it's a person, the person is aIive.
They're reaI peopIe.
They can even be reaI dead peopIe.
- I want to make one.
- Never!
- It's a huge responsibiIity.
- I'm a responsibIe person.
Omri, I'm down here.
- Don't touch the cupboard.
- OK.
I mean it, Patrick.
It means a Iot to me.
Thank you. I heard.
Can I see your arm? Yeah.
You aII right?
You need to wash that.
- It's not much.
- This chiId has a very strong wiII.
- Good ones aII have a strong wiII.
- Patrick is just pIain defiant.
- No! No!
- Yes!
It's not a game!
SIow down!
God-dang it! Put me down!
Dang...tarnation.
No more. I promise no more.
Oh, dog! Not another drop.
- He's mine.
- Shut your eyes! Watch out, Patrick!
Get back. Come on.
He shot me! He shot me!
DeIiriums! HeII-fire and damnation!
That's what it is. They're deIiriums!
That rotten Kansas sheep-dip!
WiIIiam Howard, where are you, you pot-beIIied drunkard?
Anthony MiIes, you son-of-a-buck's horse's ass!
I can't beIieve it.
He reaIIy shot me!
DarIin'! What the heII you doin' way over there?
- I can't beIieve it. This is great.
- This is not so great.
This has got to be a deIirium!
Where's my hat?
- He can't stay here.
- I want to keep him.
- I've Iost my hat!
- Can we send him back?
I'm comin' to get you, DarIin'!
I want him!
Not one more drop as Iong as I Iive.
Oh, my dear sweet Lord!
I need a drink.
This is just gettin' worse by the minute.
What's your name?
Boone. What's yours, Mr DeIirium?
He is so cooI!
Step back, cow pie.
How wiII you take care of him?
- Patrick, time to go.
- Coming! Let me keep him.
But it's got to stay a secret.
Listen, Iet me keep him here tonight.
I have this under controI.
- Bring him to schooI tomorrow.
- SchooI?
Everybody's so big.
You'II be OK. Don't cry.
I aIways cry.
The boys caII me ''Boo-hoo'' Boone.
I've got a soft heart.
- Bring him to schooI. Promise?
- I promise.
Be carefuI - cowboys and Indians!
Indians?
Omri, don't turn him back, pIease?
What Indians?
Redskins.
No!
Wait! What in the...
You better put me down!
Who do you think you are?
I'm teIIing you the truth,
I'II Iay you in your grave.
I don't care how big you are.
KindIy return to me my hat, tenderfoot.
You say you take no more men.
You teII bIind stories.
Watch out that savage don't scaIp you in your sIeep, Injun Iover.
You're not gonna shut me up in here, are you?
Now we've become reconciIed... as you start away.
Now we've become reconciIed as you start away.
Don't you want this open?
I'm not scared any more.
You can cIose it.
- Is she in the dark?
- What do you mean?
- Does she know of me?
- No.
I'm aIone.
I need a wife.
Come on and fight!
DarIin'!
Every time I try to...
We're supposed to be a team.
Hey, dang!
- What's the matter with that Injun?
- No, no, stop!
Behave!
He says I steaI his horse.
He shoots at me.
If that's true, I'II squish him
Iike a bug. Boone, drop it!
WeII, she's my horse.
- Drop it!
- No!
I'm sick of being hauIed off. I knew you'd side with that stinkin' savage.
He smeIIs and he caIIs me a dirty savage.
I didn't caII you dirty,
I caIIed you stinkin'!
Stop it, Boone!
Listen to me. Boone is Ieaving.
You don't have to Iive together.
Where can I buy coffee?
I Iike to start my day with coffee.
OK, if you'II be good,
I'II make you breakfast.
Omri cooks! Like a woman.
You are a woman.
PIease! You guys are so oId-fashioned.
I'II have you know
I'm a civiIized man.
UnIike some!
Where did you come from?
I come from Texas, Mr HaIf-a-Brain.
The United States of America, comprende?
Omri, Texas?
- You're from Texas?
- Proud of it.
- Where are you taking me?
- To schooI.
- White man goes to schooI?
- That's right.
- I go to schooI.
- You wouIdn't Iike it.
- He can go, I can go.
- It's too risky.
- Whiskey?
- Risky! Dangerous!
Good. I Iike danger.
Do you Iike danger, Texas man?
Are you threatening me, Injun? You'II need some heIp to get this scaIp.
Omri, send him back. Do it.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Bye-bye.
You got him?
CarefuI, he's so deIicate. Come here.
- Boone's in the front...
- Let me have him!
I got to check on LittIe Bear.
- You aII right, LittIe Bear?
- Let me have that!
- Come on! Give me him.
- CaIm down, Patrick.
Boys!
SchooI, remember?
AII right, thank you,
MaIcoIm and George.
AII right, Iet's have...
EmiIy and Loretta.
Loretta and I...
We're making a map of the United States.
We buiIt it here on a piece of wood.
We made the whoIe country out of fIour, water, saIt and food coIouring using beans for mountains, yarn for the rivers and rice for borders.
We're making the desert out of brown sugar.
I thought America shouId be green and yeIIow.
Loretta thought it shouId be more Iike beige...
What are these foIks taIking about?
- ..to make it more topo...
- TopographicaI.
Sounds to me Iike they've been hitting the oId tornado juice.
You ever been west of the Mississippi?
Big river?
I have traveIIed far north.
- Land of the Micmacs.
- Micmacs?
Sounds too coId for me.
- Must be purty country though.
- Yes. CoId.
Purty.
Thank you very much.
OK, now, Iet's have...
Omri and Patrick.
I'II do it!
We both agreed that I'II do it.
I'm the best taIker.
You aII know that.
Patrick and I are making a voIcano.
It's...made out of PIay...
Mixed-up PIay-Doh, it's big and...
The smaIIpox.
Yes.
WiII you marry again, LittIe Bear?
If there is a woman for me.
Maybe have another IittIe chiId.
Yes.
I wiII heaI when
I have another chiId.
LittIe chiIdren are the sun and moon and the stars.
Good morning, boys and girIs.
Today, Iunch is macaroni and cheese and a buiId-your-own sandwich.
Don't worry about the iguana, mouIting is a naturaI process.
Origami is canceIIed today.
Damn!
AII right, everybody, stay in doubIe Iine, pIease. Thank you.
FoIIow Mrs Cox.
That's a wonderfuI story that you're writing.
- Yeah.
- Have you read about the Iroquois?
What interested you the most?
There were six tribes that joined together to stop the war.
They formed a true government, our constitution borrowed from them.
- Yeah.
- So, what eIse?
As you know, I got to get going to computer cIass.
- OK, I'II show you.
- No!
What are you doing?
- I'm just having fun.
- They're two reaI men.
- It's not fun.
- Shove it!
HeIIo! Excuse me.
What's going on here? What happened?
What happened?
AII right, somebody start taIking.
- We can't resoIve this now.
- We need to try.
- I can resoIve it. Want to see how?
- No!
- I couId do it!
- Do what?
No, no!
- I couId show. I couId.
- Show what?
You can't. They're peopIe.
You can't use peopIe.
AII right...
Patrick, show me what's in your pouch.
PIease.
Patrick, show me what's in your pouch.
They're just pIastic toys.
PIazteck peopIe.
- They're just compIeteIy pIazteck.
- OK.
- That's fine.
- PIazteck.
- Yes. Thank you. Let me see.
- PIazteck.
Let me see.
They're just peopIe.
Why don't you two work this out?
But no more fighting, OK?
- AII right.
- Go catch up with your cIass.
''It's just Iike having a chiId.
''Every time I'm away from him,
I worry that he's OK.
''I come home and open the door
''and worry about what I wiII find.
''But he's a man.
I can't treat him Iike a baby.''
Good. Sam.
''JFK.
''JFK was about the youngest man ever president.
''There were IittIe kids in the White House.''
Mum, can Patrick pIease spend the night?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Spend the night?
It's a wife.
Excuse me.
- That's great. Come on.
- Look at 'em.
Who wiII she be?
- What is that?
- It's a wife.
A wife? My mother shouId choose me a wife.
But your mother's not here.
I've been thinking about settIing down my own seIf.
It's gone. The cupboard's gone.
Who wouId take it?
- Where is it?
- Where's what?
- The cupboard, butt-head.
- Who gave you that cupboard?
PIease, where's the cupboard?
GiIi, pIease.
Where's my rat baII?
Where? PIease?
In the crawIspace.
Damn.
The key! Where's the key?
There was no key. I swear.
You mean, we've got to Iive here forever? LittIe Iike this?
No new wife for LittIe Bear?
No baby? He needs a baby.
I couId Iook for another key.
I want to go home. We've just got the raiIroad coming through town and we've got a new doctor, a good doctor.
HeII, it's 1879. I'm Iiving at the dawn of a new century.
Now I know what you was taIking about.
God sure do pIay with men, aII right.
There is no god here.
Come on, GiIi!
- Bye, Mum. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, guys.
Bye, Mum.
Disgusting dispIay.
They do this in front of chiIdren?
- It's not reaI.
- It's reaI aII right. It's reaI.
Let's change to the Discovery ChanneI.
..roaming the great savannahs of Africa.
Let me see that cIicker.
Apaches! The ugIiest Redskins that ever waIked the earth!
Get 'em, boys! HeII, yeah!
Amigo?
- He's aIive.
- I wish we had Tommy.
- You do not have the key.
- Can you take the arrow out?
BIood wiII fIow. Get me husks.
We have no husks.
Leave me.
Boys?
Time for bed.
- Can you turn out the Iight, pIease?
- Sure.
I feeI Iike I haven't seen you in days.
- Cartoon day tomorrow.
- I don't think we'II watch, thanks.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.
- Night, Patrick.
- Night, Janie.
If you hear noises under fIoor, it's GiIi's rat.
- What?
- He escaped.
Dad puIIed up your fIoorboards but he couIdn't get him.
That rat's under my fIoor?
Maybe. He might have moved on.
If we're Iucky, he moved out.
- Oh, no.
- I know.
Good night, guys.
- Do you think he'II be OK?
- A rat wiII eat at a wounded man.
Now we can't go to sIeep at aII.
We'II take turns.
If you go first,
I'II give you a miIIion doIIars.
Wake up! I hear the rat! Get up!
- It's the key!
- Get it!
HoId this.
Watch out.
Oh, no!
Let me go.
I am too big. I am too big!
See if you can get under that Ioose fIoorboard there.
There's an animaI, a big animaI.
Move fast.
Do you see a way? Is there a hoIe?
Yes, I see one.
Yeah?
- What are aIso dangers?
- Everything.
Did he take his bow and arrow?
And his knife?
I hear him! Over there!
- Where is he?
- LittIe Bear, come back.
Come back.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
PIease, LittIe Bear, come back.
Why won't he come?
I got him!
It's you again.
I do pick my moments to faII asIeep.
A great Minnie whining overhead.
Thought I was a goner.
Perhaps I am a goner. Did I die?
No. You're dreaming again.
There's two of you now, are there? Good show.
WeII, take me to him.
The eIegant Injun?
No, it's another.
That's cIever. HeIIo again.
- The bIeeding stopped.
- Yes. Good.
He needs a bIood transfusion but I'm not prepared for that.
- A buIIet, was it?
- Arrow.
Lucky it missed his heart and Iung.
The cotton's damp.
So, you're a paI of his, are you?
Amigo.
That shouId just about do it.
Look, keep a cIose watch on him.
PIenty of water.
He couId use a doctor's care.
There's a doctor in his town.
- No.
- When he wakes up.
Not yet.
It's time for them to go home.
Good. That wiII do.
He needs to sIeep.
WeII, I best be getting back.
We'II aII be waking up soon enough.
I suggest a drop of brandy.
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome, mate.
BuckIes keep catching on my doodah.
I'm so ashamed of myseIf.
I hurt you.
What are you taIking about?
Did I hear somebody mention brandy?
No, Omri.
She has her Iife.
She has a famiIy, a cIan.
Maybe a husband and a chiId.
I don't want you to be aIone.
I wiII be with my peopIe.
I wiII be with you when the sun rises?
One more time.
Hey, son. When we go back, are we going back to the Iast thing we remember or ahead?
I don't know.
I hope it's forwards.
How about you, LittIe Bear?
LittIe Bear, where are you headed?
I was on the journey with my brother's son.
I think I wiII wake up in the woods.
It is quiet and the nights are getting coId.
I can aImost smeII the trees.
I can aImost smeII them, too.
Like I'm part Indian now myseIf.
If you were my nephew, it'd be time to waIk you through the forest.
I wouId go.
It is difficuIt.
You wouId Iive by yourseIf, care for yourseIf.
We wouId traveI for days, teII stories, hunt and fish.
I'd Ieave you and return to the viIIage.
You must Iive aIone for one season.
You wouId Iearn to Iive in harmony with Mother Nature... the two-Iegged, the four-Iegged, the winged.
When the seasons change, my nephew wouId come home.
I wouId be waiting for you.
We wouId have a great ceIebration because you return to the viIIage...as a man.
When I Ieave you, Omri,
I take you...as my nephew.
Time to go, gentIemen.
Easy, DarIin'. Easy, now.
Don't y'aII forget me.
I won't.
You Iook after yourseIf now,
LittIe Bear.
And you, friend.
- Goodbye, my friendIy giants.
- Great Spirit?
Yes, LittIe Bear?
TeII me about the Onondaga gah.
Are we aIways a great peopIe?
You are aIways a great peopIe, but it's not aIways so good.
- Things change for us?
- They wiII.
We go.
Now!
''I wiII never know where he is or how he is
''but I don't worry about him any more.
''I think LittIe Bear wiII have Iots of chiIdren
''and he wiII teach them everything.
''He wiII aIways take care of his peopIe.''
That's aII.
Very nice.
That's a good ending, Omri.
Sam.
''One day JFK was kiIIed.
''He was shot on a street in Texas.
''My grandpa says that he remembered exactIy where he was...''
EngIish
You've got to think of him the way he was.
He cycled around Dublin... in his pin-striped suit with
Â£10,000 on his head.
"Why hide, Joe", he'd say...
"...when that's what they expect?"
But he never did what anyone expected.
He got the British out of here, and no one expected that.
Some people are what the times demand... and life without them seems impossible.
But he's dead.
And life is possible.
He made it possible.
Fire!
Cease firing!
Cease firing!
Move forward!
Come forward!
Keep your hands in the air and your weapons visible at all times.
Form up, in three columns... across the square.
Now, ground your arms.
Take three paces back... slowly.
Move three paces back, now!
The game's over, Harry. We lost again.
Quick...march!
Pick your feet up!
Move it, you Fenian bastard!
Open the gates!
Show me the ringleaders of this little farce.
Pearse... with the gunner eye.
McDonagh.
Thomas Clarke.
Connolly.
Get up, you Fenian swine.
Wait, Michael. Wait.
Till when?
Till the next time.
Eamon de Valera.
What happens next time?
We won't play by their rules.
We'll invent our own.
Fire!
"The fact...
"that I was born in...
"America...
"might save my hide.

"I am ready...

Fire!

They let us out of jail so we can do our best to be put inside again.
Don't you see a certain paradox in that?
Paradox.
A contradiction.
An immovable force meets an immovable object kind of thing.
Look, isn't that a lovely picture?
Maybe we should settle down.
Just the two of us?
And him.
Who?
How are you?
How long has that man been there?
As long as we have. Half an hour or so.
How'd they know we were coming?
They know what we ate for breakfast.
There's only one way to beat them, then.
Find out what they eat for breakfast.
Fuck.
It's market day.
Where are you going?
So, what did you have for breakfast?
A traffic jam, lads.
If you backed up, we could back up... and you could chase us some more.
If we sit here a minute, it'll sort itself out.
Grand so.
The fact that the candidate you're being asked to vote for... is at this moment rotting in an
English jail shouldn't put you off!
I was in one myself till a week ago!
They can jail us.
They can shoot us.
They can even conscript us!
They can use us as cannon fodder in the Somme!
But... we have a weapon more powerful... than any in the whole arsenal of the British Empire!
That weapon... is our refusal!
Our refusal to bow to any order but our own!
Any institution but our own!
Our friends in the Royal Irish
Constabulary want to shut me up.
Jail me again, shoot me, who knows?
But I'd like you to send them a message!
If they shut me up, who'll take my place?
Who'll take my place?
We will!
I can't hear you! Who'll take my place?
Will they shut you up?
Clear a path!
Clear a path!
Get him out! Go, get him out!
So, what's your name?
Kitty.
Is Harry here?
Downstairs.
What did they hit you with?
Whatever it was, it was hard.
- You'll be all right.
- You're a nurse, Kitty?
I'm nothing.
I'm my father's daughter.
Who's your father?
He's dead.
There's dinner in an hour, if you fancy it.
Grand so.
"Last night she came to me
"She came softly in
"Was so softly she came that
"Her feet made no din
"And she laid her hand on me
"And this she did say
"'Aye, it will not be long, love
"'Till our
"'Wedding day"'
Gorgeous, Kitty. Beautiful.
Mick's about to make another speech.
What are you saying, you Dublin jackeen?
What would you know about singing?
I agree, you West Cork muck savage.
You're the expert in singing.
So it's your turn now, right?
Hey, hey, give over, Harry, will ya.
She has a voice like an angel.
I have one like a puck goat.
Is it or is it not Mick's turn?
No, please.
A noble call is mine... and I call on Michael.
Mick, give us your party piece.
Come on, Mick. Give us a song.
He hasn't a note in his head.
Shut up.
"Well do I remember the bleak December day
"The landlord and the sheriff came to drive us all away
"They set my roof on fire with their cursed foreign spleen
"And that's another reason
"Why I left old Skibereen"
Twelve more verses, now.
You wanted to be woken.
There was a man in West Cork who proposed to five sisters... one after the other.
I suppose they all refused.
Then the father died, and he proposed to the mother.
Are you trying to tell me something?
I was building up to a proposal.
It's not easy with a Fenian in your bed.
- He likes you too.
- I do?
Stop it.
- But, sadly, he snores.
- I do not.
So it's up to you, Kitty.
- I don't have to like either.
- Never was a truer word spoken.
And he sleeps in his trousers.
Forgive the brute.
Morning.
Morning.
Behave yourself.
Am I dreaming?
I think you are.
We'll be an invisible army.
Our uniform will be that of the man on the street, the peasant in the field.
We'll strike the enemy and vanish back in the crowd again.
What do we strike with?
What have you got?
Show me.
Jeez, look at this, Harry.
Same old story.
You need something better.
Where's the police barracks?
- Two miles down the road.
- There is an arsenal.
How do we get in? We have no bullets!
They don't know that.
What's that?
- A sod of turf.
- Wrong. That's a weapon.
Fucking deadly.
You don't believe me?
What is it now?
Good evening, lads.
Hands in the air.
- Drop your weapons!
- Now!
We'll relieve you of your responsibilities.
Grab that bag, one of youse.
Jesus, lads, it's Christmas.
You'll be organized in flying columns.
Fight on your own terms.
What's your name?
- Whose terms, Pat?
- Ours.
I want each of those to capture ten more.
And I want you to account for every bullet, understand?
Stand up!
- You understand?
- Yes, sir!
I'll make a fucking army out of you if it's the last thing I do.
- Am I late, Joe?
- Not yet.
Can't keep the gob-shites waiting.
Harry, I want something...
Hold on, hold on. Behind you.
Jesus wept.
Five minutes.
Sit down.
Have a drink.
What's this?
What's all this?
You've been on my heels for weeks.
Very eager for a G man.
I've something for you.
Don't!
Don't you ever calm down?
Names and addresses of the whole cabinet.
They're to be lifted tonight.
It's an illegal gathering... in open defiance of His Majesty's government.
How'd you get this?
Like you said, I'm eager, for a G man.
Why should I trust you?
Logically, I suppose you shouldn't.
But I've been on your heels for weeks... making notes of your speeches.
Let's just say that you can be persuasive.
You work for the Castle.
I know.
What was it you said...
"Our only weapon is our refusal".
I am getting very tired of the spectacle... of an upstart dominating these entire cabinet proceedings.
I've said it before and I'll say it again:
The minister is, as usual, exceeding his brief.
And just what is my brief?
Intelligence.
Bullshit.
I'm minister for gunrunning, daylight robbery and general mayhem.
Until we're armed, nothing's going to happen.
But as minister of intelligence,
I'd like to inform you... that each of us is to be arrested... tonight.
How does the minister know this?
Now, Cathal, don't exceed your brief.
Names, addresses, next of kin, of the whole cabinet.
They know more about us than our mothers do.
How do we know it's genuine?
We don't, chief. But it could well be.
So, nobody sleeps at home tonight.
I disagree.
Do sleep at home tonight.
If Mr. Collins has been gulled, we'll sleep soundly.
If not, they will arrest the cabinet.
The public outcry will be deafening.
Maybe then the world will listen.
You can't be serious. We've been rotting in English jails long enough!
I... am... serious, Michael.
Fuck them.
- Mind your tongue.
- I fucking will in future.
Mother of God.
Pull in.
Christ, the G man was right.
Come on.
This is an illegal arrest... by an illegal force of occupation!
Jesus Christ.
It's the safest house in Dublin now.
May as well stay the night.
What does the minister think?
Which minister?
We're the only two left.
I'm changing your brief.
I hereby appoint you minister for general mayhem.
What's your brief?
The same.
Plus one other portfolio.
Jailbreaks.
How are youse?
Didn't I tell you he snores?
How are you?
Do you remember Kitty?
Indeed I do. Do you remember me?
Vaguely.
All right... l know when I'm not wanted.
See you.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Boland.
I'll wrestle you for her.
Go away.
She's not interested in a bogman like you.
Want to bet?
Come here, Boland!
Leave me alone!
Give us a hand, will you?
Give me an ear!
Fuck off and leave me alone!
What's your game, Mr. Broy?
- Don't have a game.
- Why did you give me that list?
Why didn't you act on it?
The cabinet thinks it's useful in jail.
You obviously don't agree.
Look...
Castle informers have run us through like woodworm.
You could play the same game.
You're a queer bloody G man.
You don't believe me, do you?
I'm not sure.
What would convince you?
Show me the Castle files.
I'd never get them out.
No... but you could get me in.
Jesus, you're serious?
Think I'm joking?
Does anybody know what I look like?
Only me.
Pretend I'm an informer.
Let me in at midnight.
We'd never get away with it.
Everything's possible if you wish hard enough. Who said that?
You did.
'Twas him.
Peter Pan.
How is it?
- Grand evening.
- Yeah, not bad.
Is Broy here?
- Who?
- Detective Ned Broy.
Told me to drop by if I had information.
How are you?
Inspector Broy?
Down there.
- Who is it?
- Grace, sir, John Grace.
Come in, Mr. Grace.
I've information relating to the guttersnipe called Collins.
- You're not nervous?
- I'm shaking.
Don't.
Use this.
Sorry.
Index to the files.
Files on the IRB in England,
Scotland, America.
Irish Volunteers.
Sinn Fein, more Sinn Fein.
More IRB.
I have to lock you in.
If you hear anyone, be quiet.
If caught, you're on your own.
Don't I know it.
Jesus wept.
Christ, that's all we need.
Get up, you! Get up!
- Get up!
- He was celebrating, Tom!
The birth of his child.
Was he, now?
And what was it, boy or girl?
Girl.
Have a drink.
All work and no play.
Are you finished in here?
It's a drink, is it? Shame to waste it.
Take it.
Let's get you cleaned up and take you home.
- Where's me breakfast?
- Time to go, Mick.
Wait a minute.
Mick, you're pushing it.
Can you get a typist?
Why?
Copy every new file and send it to me.
I'll try. Now, you've got to leave.
You could squash us in a week, you know.
Why do you think I came to you?
If we don't get there first... things might get rough.
How rough?
Very rough.
These files are no good without the G men who compiled them.
That's rough.
Can you handle it?
After tonight, I can handle anything.
Come on.
Where the hell have you been?
Working.
Where?
I want a file made on every member of the British administration.
Look through whatever you can find:
"Who's Who", society columns.
I want names, addresses, clubs... where they bank, what they eat for breakfast.
Keep it up to date. Add to it weekly.
Tom... get me a list of our 12 best men.
Young, no families.
- What for?
- The 12 Apostles. Just do it!
Joe, take a letter.
Where have you been?
"To Whom It May Concern:
"This is to inform you that any further collaboration...
"with the forces of occupation will be punishable by death.
"You have been warned.
"Signed, the Irish Republican Army".
Are you serious?
Afraid so.
Send one to every G man.
I saw their files. They know too much.
Look.
Look. That's us.
- Where'd you get these?
- Know how they thrive?
Informers.
Without them, the Brits would have no system.
Now, imagine the Castle... where anyone who collaborated knew he'd be shot.
They wouldn't be able to move outside those fucking walls.
That's how serious I am.
There's only one problem.
What?
We'd have to do it.
Yes.
So... could you bear it?
You got one too?
It's a joke.
No Fenian guttersnipe threatens me.
Give us a name.
What for?
Someone to hang and fry like bacon!
Here's one.
Cullen.
Don't threaten us, you Fenian swine.
We threaten you!
What's this mean?
It means you can get out now.
What?
Give up our jobs?
And miss out on all the fun?
Or face the music, Hoey.
You're the only one who will make music here.
God's curse on them!
Go on!
Who's John Grace?
Ned?
They dumped him.
Tommy.
Hoey.
I know. Come on.
Any of ye who read Irish history know movements like ours... are always destroyed by paid spies and informers.
I want to set up an outfit that'll rectify that.
Your job will be to wreck the system of information the Castle uses against us.
To make it unhealthy for them to run it.
How unhealthy?
We've sent letters of warning... to every G man.
If they're stupid enough to stay in the Castle... then they'll be shot.
And you will have to do the shooting.
Don't expect it to be pleasant.
Any of ye with any qualms, there's the door.
Would we have got past the door?
You would have, Vinny.
Seriously though,
I won't force this on any man.
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
I want to thank you.
For what, Father?
For these mornings... praying together.
I can't pretend to understand your politics.
But I can appreciate... your integrity.
And I yours, Father.
And if prayer... can transcend these things... there's hope, surely.
There must be.
Raid!
Out! Everybody out!
Move! Get out!
Ma'am, how do I get out of here?
Grand.
Give me The Mail.
That's for the job on Friday.
Get them! Get those two men!
Stop them!
These are the best premises you could get?
A temporary stopgap, I swear.
What'll be next, the knackers' yard?
Made the front page.
What does it say?
"Dublin Detective Riddled With Bullets".
"Riddled"? Riddled?
Why are you riddling people?
Ten bullets, when the one would do?
To make sure he died.
Lads, try and remember they don't grow on trees.
- What don't they grow on?
- Trees.
Get out.
- From the chief.
- When?
This morning.
Boys, you did well.
But go easy on the riddling.
Go on.
Sure it's from Dev?
Christ, pure genius.
Look.
Yeah, I want peace and quiet.
I want it so much I'd die for it.
You mean you'd kill for it first.
No, not first. Last.
You know you are good at it.
At what?
Bloody mayhem.
You're not so bad yourself.
But Mick, you're more than good.
You leave them sitting in the halfpenny place.
We haven't seen anything yet.
Are you saying things will get worse?
So we'll have to get worse?
Yep.
Know what?
I hate them.
Not for their race or their brutality.
I hate them for leaving us no way out.
I hate whoever put a gun in Vinny's hand.
I know it's me and I hate myself for it.
I hate them for making hate necessary.
I'll do what I have to do to end it.
Fancy a good time?
Not tonight, girls.
Relax, you bastard.
Dev, two minutes to the next watch.
Fuck's sake.
Mind your language.
The bleeding key broke.
I'll try mine.
You can't. The fucking keyhole's jammed.
That's no excuse for obscenities.
Maybe I can force it out.
Come on, Mick.
Come on!
Come on, Dev. Push.
Got it! Got it!
Emergency supplies!
Man, you are blessed.
What's this?
A fur coat. Pretend you're a whore.
Come on! Up ahead!
All I'm missing is the high heels.
Drive! Hop to!
Get out! Get out!
You look good in furs.
There are certain things one should not do for one's country.
Like what? Go on the game?
Some died for lreland, but Dev whored for lreland.
I suppose it does set a historical precedent.
I'll take you home again, Kathleen.
I see you've had fun in my absence.
Right. Fun and games all the way, chief.
I know.
I read the papers.
God, we're famous.
No, he is. Lay low for a week.
That nose of his is hard to hide.
Then all of Dublin can throw a hooley.
- Did Dev speak to you?
- About what?
He wants to go to America.
Aye. And he wants me to go with him.
You can't do this to me!
I want American public support and... recognition from the U.S. for an Irish Republic.
I want international opinion brought to bear on the British government.
There's only one force they understand and you know it!
Our job is at home!
Our job is where I say it is.
As president of the Irish Republic... l want recognition from the U.S.
Go to America then, blast you!
But leave me Boland!
What's so special about Harry?
- I can't do it without him.
- Do what?
I can't run a war without Harry Boland!
You could run it without me.
Christ, all of Dublin must be out there,
Harry.
Look! Look at the face on Smith.
So near, yet he can't touch him.
Don't worry. He'll try.
Not here, he won't.
No. But we can't let the
Long Fella hang around.
Harry, come on! Move!
Dev!
Chief!
Good luck, mates.
- Open up!
- Get out of my house!
Upstairs!
Remember one thing.
You're my chief, always!
Go on!
Move!
Since you Dublin boyos can't sort out this Collins...
I suppose it's up to us.
Files on the IRB, England,
Scotland, America.
The Irish Volunteers.
Sinn Fein, more Sinn Fein.
Forget files!
I want anyone with a remote connection to this geezer lifted! Tonight!
It's not that simple, sir.
But it is that simple, Mr. Broy.
We'll make it that simple.
There's a new regime in here... and it's starting now!
Good day, Mr. Broy.
Belfast efficiency's what they need.
Passport.
You're Harry Clyne till you get there.
Here's a birth-cert for you, some money and the like.
There.
Thanks, Mick.
Fuck and blast him!
I told him I can't do without you!
Why do you think he chose me?
He's scared to leave us together.
We might achieve the Republic he's talking to the world about.
I don't know.
They're filling up the Castle from Belfast.
Things'll get rough.
Rougher than we can imagine.
You don't let them near you, hear me?
Don't let them near you.
They can't imagine a gunman in a pinstriped suit on a bicycle.
Fuck it. It's worked for us so far.
Let's hope my luck holds and the wheels don't buckle.
- Coming to the train?
- I will.
There's someone to say hello to.
Yeah? I wonder who that is, now.
She needs looking after while I'm away.
- He's leaving me, Mick.
- I thought he was leaving me.
Shut up, you two. I'm leaving no one.
Do all the women in America wear trousers?
Yes. Shameless hussies, the lot of them.
Did you hear?
A butterfly's been seen in West Clare.
Its wings are green, white and yellow.
It's a sign.
My foot.
- I'm telling you.
- Know the problem of butterflies?
- What?
- They only last one day.
But what a day, Mick.
- This one's empty.
- What a day.
I leave you so. Here's your ticket.
It'll be all right.
I pray it will.
See you, Mick.
I don't want to go.
- Will you write?
- I will.
You promise?
See you.
Papers, miss.
Lads, lads... let a man say good-bye to his wife in peace.
Sorry, Kitty.
We call it taking liberties.
I promised Harry I'd look after you.
Come on.
Take a section each.
The sooner we finish, the sooner we go home.
Toothcomb, gentlemen.
Toothcomb.
Black and Tan scum!
Fuck off!
We put up with this bollox every fucking day!
Stupid Irish cow!
I love trains. Don't you, Ned?
What's so special about them?
They make me think of places
I know I'll never see.
They're the elite of the
British Secret Service.
Churchill handpicked them.
Give me everything you've got.
No addresses?
They keep to themselves.
They were sent here for one reason.
To eliminate you and your boys.
I can't hold on much longer, Mick.
It's pulling me to ribbons.
Neither can I, Ned.
But sure keep it a secret.
Doesn't he have a face, this Collins?
Doesn't he have corporeal form?
This the best you've got?
Afraid so, sir.
That'll be all, boy.
Broy, sir.
Broy.
Yes. Broy.
Trouble you for a light, sir?
Ta.
So that's Mr. Soames. How many to go?
Nineteen.
Tom, move.
I'll handle it, Liam. Tom.
How are you, Charlie?
This is Rosie.
How are you? Sit down.
Tell him about Mr. Soames.
Well, he tips me every day.
Not like some.
What time does he get up?
I come in at nine.
He's washing behind the screen, so I don't see him.
I empty the basket and take the linen.
And then he reaches over the screen with a half-crown.
You shouldn't take it.
He's a gentleman.
And you're a lady. Shut up, you.
Thank you, Mr. Collins.
Show him what you got from the basket.
Ta.
Come on.
God bless you, Rosie.
We've got them.
They have more experience.
You'll get only once chance.
It's either them or us.
We hit them at daybreak.
If you're not up to it, say so now.
I know what some of you have been through.
There's no shame in pulling out.
Thank you.
Don't stay in your usual places...
Vaughan's, Cleary's Pub.
If any of us are lifted, we're dead!
Understood?
Let's go.
I got a message for you from Kitty.
- Where is she?
- Vaughan's.
Get your things, Kitty.
- Couldn't you say hello?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
- Harry told me to look out for you.
You've heard of common courtesy?
No.
Kitty, please. You can't stay here.
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.
Come on!
If any of our lads come in, tell them to stay somewhere else.
- Where?
- Anywhere else! And look sharp!
Sufficient unto the day the evil thereof, boy?
Yes, sir.
Or is it Broy?
Broy, sir.
Good night.
Stay on him.
You're hurting me.
I said, you're hurting me!
Kitty, please.
Please.
The Gresham.
Can't tell you...no, everything's fine.
Call me if anything's up.
Come in!
Where will you have it, Mr. Grace?
Here.
- Ta.
- Thank you.
I'm going, Mick.
You can't!
Why do you think I brought you here?
I don't know why!
Vaughan's isn't safe.
Not tonight.
Sweet mother of God!
What was on the paper, Paddy?
Words.
Just words.
What's happening tonight?
You don't want to know.
Am I allowed to guess?
Heard from Harry?
Yes.
He wrote.
He always writes.
When you both came to Granard the first time, you....
But he was the one that wrote.
Why was that, Mick?
He's the writing type, Harry.
What type are you?
Let me go!
I know exactly where I'm going!
I can walk!
I can walk!
Promise me something, Kitty.
Anything.
Promise me you'll never care about me.
Please.
I promise.
That's the trouble with the Irish.
They sing at the drop of a hat.
Ask them to talk and they won't.
Do what you have to do.
You've sent your boys out, haven't you?
It's written on your face.
Every step they take.
Like so many valentines.
Delivering bouquets.
Do you send a love note, Mick... with the flowers?
What does it say?
Do it now!
Jesus!
Come on!
Go!
It says, "Leave us be!"
Is that all?
Not very romantic.
Move away from her.
You could at least spare my wife this spectacle.
Take her outside.
I'm not his bloody wife!
Say your prayers.
You know what it says, Kitty?
It says, "Give us the future.
We've had enough of your past".
The Lord is my shepherd....
"Give us our country back...
"to live in...
"to grow in...
"to love".
So there is love there, Mick.
Hang on, Rosie.
Clean sheets, I think.
Come on!
So, Mick... flowers delivered.
Do you think they got the message?
Any casualties?
Any casualties?
Are you deaf?
Broy.
Ned - fucking - Broy!
What are you talking about?
Broy wasn't out.
They lifted him at Vaughan's.
What was he doing?
Oh, sweet mother of Jesus.
Can't risk it any longer, Mick.
Who'll give in first, Joe?
Us or them?
The body or the lash?
You look like a gangster!
You look like a ghost!
Welcome back, Harry!
How are you keeping?
Grand.
You're famous over there.
Where?
Over there, you thick.
So, how was America?
Great.
Dev never got to meet the President.
I didn't think he would.
How are you?
I'm grand.
Welcome back, chief.
The Big Fella sends his regards.
We'll see who is the big fella.
Apologies, gentlemen.
As you may know... we have had some communication from the British side.
There is a slim possibility... that they might want to talk.
But our... tactics... allowed the British press to paint us as murderers.
If we are to negotiate as a legitimate government... our armed forces must act... like a legitimate army.
What exactly do you mean, Dev?
I mean large-scale engagements.
You mean, like in 1916?
The great heroic ethic of failure... marching to slaughter.
Why don't we save them the bother and blow our own brains out?
How dare you!
How did we get them to this point... to consider talking?
We brought them to their knees the only way we could!
They call us... murderers.
War is murder! Sheer, bloody murder!
Had you been here the past year, you'd know that!
I propose an assault... on the administrative center of British rule in lreland:
The Customs House.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
How many lost?
6 dead, 70 taken! Bloody fiasco!
Christ, not again!
The guns!
We need the guns!
Leave them!
There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do.
How much longer can we hold out?
Four weeks. But keep it a secret.
As little as that?
Unless we use bows and arrows.
Don't be flippant, Michael.
We nearly lost 80 men last week, Dev.
You tell him, Harry.
He's right, chief.
I lied.
You lied? About what?
We can't hold out for another week.
Christ! Do they know that?
Nobody knows.
Mick, Dev's negotiating.
Yes, so he doesn't know either.
It's very important he doesn't know.
The world must believe we're invincible.
Maybe then we can talk.
Jesus Christ.
Kitty's down.
So I heard.
Is she down to see you or me?
Maybe both of us.
You take her down to Kingstown.
Get some sea air.
No, why don't you take her?
No, you take her.
- No, you take her.
- No, you do.
A horse called "Irish Republic" ran at Donnybrook today.
What were the odds?
- 50-to-1.
- Jesus, some odds, what?
There's 100,000 Tommies here and not 2,000 of us.
I'd say 50-to-1 is optimistic.
Optimistic or no... she won.
No, you're joking?
10 bob each way, that makes Â£25... plus the place money, Â£7,10.
So I won...
Â£33,10, thank you very much.
Let the Irish Republic buy us dinner.
I know just where to go.
Which one of you will ask me to dance?
- Me, me, me, please!
- No, I will. I will.
Heads, it's Harry. Tails, it's Mick.
- Kitty, may I have the pleasure?
- The gangster wins again.
Watch his feet, Kitty.
Shut up, you.
I shouldn't have left, should I?
Why not?
I was a length ahead.
Now where am I?
It's not a race, Harry.
Mind telling me what it is, then?
You without him... him without you... l can't imagine it.
Three-legged race.
Mick, where the hell have you been?
For God's sake, give me one free night to be a human being!
We looked all over! Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard!
Would the bloody Irish Republic leave me some time off?
It's over!
What's over?
It's over.
They called a truce.
It's finished?
- The whole damn thing.
- Yes.
We've won?
Lloyd George has thrown in the towel?
We've brought the British Empire to its knees?
Yes.
Why the fuck didn't you say so?
What was that horse called?
We did it! We did it! It's a truce!
What?
You must be joking?
No. I won't do it.
I'm not a politician.
I'm not going to London.
You're the strongest card we have.
They call me an assassin and a murderer!
Will Churchill even shake my hand?
We've broached it and had no objections.
You go, Dev.
You're the statesman.
You know how far we can push them.
They know you.
That's the point. They don't know you.
Don't do this to me, Dev. Don't do it.
I'm no good at talk.
I'm a yob from West Cork.
Please!
You'll head our team, Michael... to negotiate a treaty for the first time in history... between lreland and England.
We need to keep a final arbitrator in reserve.
You.
That will be the Irish people.
And me... as president of the Irish Republic.
Why does he want me there?
Why?
- You put the fear of God into them.
- Save me the bullshit.
Mick, you are the strongest card we have.
What's he up to?
- What are you talking about?
- I have one simple asset.
All these years, no one knows what I look like.
Which one of you is Michael Collins?
He is.
That's him.
The small fella.
"From your very own plenipotentiary, to the provisions of the said document...
"hereinafter to be referred to as The Letter:
"They didn't defeat us by force of arms...
"but now they'll try to do it by force of verbiage.
"The English language wasn't meant to be spoken like that.
"How did these people ever get to run an empire?"
Don't.
Why not?
'Cause you'll get hurt.
How will I get hurt?
I'm in love with him.
I'm sorry.
I have to tell you.
Have you told him?
No.
And maybe I never will.
I'm only telling you because I can't hurt you.
Lucky Mick.
I did my best, Kitty, but it won't be good enough.
We'll have an Irish Free State, instead of an Irish Republic.
We'll have our own government.
But we have to swear allegiance to the English Crown.
The position of the north will be reviewed... but now it remains part of the British Empire.
This treaty isjust a steppingstone.
I hope the country sees it as such.
How are you?
Is this true?
It's the best anyone could have got.
This gives up the north... divides the country.
You expect us to give an oath of allegiance to the Crown?
They can't comprehend giving us the Republic.
And that's why Dev sent me.
What?
He knew we'd get no Republic.
He wanted me to bring back the bad news.
We can use the Irish Free State to achieve the Republic we want.
It's either this or war.
I won't go to war over words.
What if it's war either way, Mick?
You published the terms without my agreement!
- They were the best we could get.
- In your opinion!
You sent me there knowing they were the best we'd get.
- Idle speculation.
- No, it's the truth.
Or else you'd have gone yourself.
We don't have the Republic... but freedom to achieve it.
Peacefully.
Surely it's time for peace.
What would you know about peace?
You said we could negotiate on behalf of our government... the D il and the Irish people.
If they reject it, I'll reject it.
If they stand by it, I'll stand by it.
I want to know you'll do the same.
Will you come in for a pint?
He's read the papers.
Say something, would you?
I've known the two of you for four years.
You've slept together, lived together, fought together.
But your war is over now.
What if it's just the beginning?
Christ.
I'd be better off in Longford.
We were elected by the people of lreland...
We were elected by the people.
Did they think we were liars when we meant to uphold the Irish Republic?
The letters preceding the negotiations... not once demanded recognition of the Irish Republic!
We knew it would have been refused!
So Mr. Collins is asking us... to accept an oath of allegiance to a foreign king... and the partition... and the partition of the northern part of the country!
Mr. Collins, the man who won the recent war... has himself described the treaty... as a steppingstone toward the ultimate freedom!
Mr. Griffith has described Mr. Collins as the man who won the war!
Point of order, Mr. Chairman.
Are we discussing the treaty or myself?
The minister does not like what I say!
Anything about me, say it!
Mr. Collins, your position in the army... was as chief of one subsection.
Nobody sought notoriety except you!
Come on, Cathal!
One person was held up by the press... and put into a position he never held.
He was made a romantic figure... a mystical character... which he certainly is not!
The person I refer to is Michael Collins!
I would plead... with every person here.
Make me a scapegoat, if you will.
Call me a traitor, if you will.
But please, let's save the country.
The alternative to this treaty is a war... which nobody in this gathering can even contemplate.
If the price of freedom... the price of peace, is blackening my name... l will gladly pay it.
Thank you.
The result, ladies and gentlemen... is 64 to 57.
A majority of seven... in favor of the treaty.
There is one thing I want to say.
I want it to go... to the country... and to the world.
And it is this:
The Irish people established the Republic.
It can only... be disestablished... by the Irish people.
As a protest... against the ratification of this treaty... which can only subvert... the Republic...
I... and my deputies... are leaving this house.
Traitors!
Traitors, all!
Not you, Harry.
All right, you've won.
You always win, Mr. Collins.
Rarely, Miss Kiernan.
Very rarely.
Jesus, I hate you.
Sure. Join the club.
You're seven minutes late, Mr. Collins.
You've kept us waiting 700 years.
You can have your seven minutes.
Let's get this over with.
Company, present arms!
So that's what caused all the bother?
Now what?
Do I get to wear that hat?
This treaty... bars the way to the Republic... with the blood... of fellow Irishmen!
If it is only with civil war... that we can get our independence... then so be it!
The Volunteers... will have to wade through Irish blood... through the blood of some members of this government... in order to get...
Irish freedom!
After 700 years....
After 700 years....
Let him speak!
Kitty, don't!
Leave him be!
You put the heart across me, Kitty.
I like the sound of your voice.
They won't accept the treaty.
No matter how the vote goes.
You heard what de Valera said.
"And to wade through rivers of blood..."
And who's blood you think he's talking about?
Yours.
Will you marry me?
Yeah.
You will?
It's that simple?
Yeah.
Who gave you that, you little runt?
What's all this about?
- We've taken over the Four Courts.
- You fucking fool!
Mind your language.
You'll start a civil war!
We'll defend the Republic.
These kids don't know guns!
- We know how to train them.
- The way I trained you?
- On whose orders?
- The Volunteer Executive.
Dev's part of it?
His half of it?
Go away home to your mothers, all of you!
You know what this means?
The army's split down the middle.
- Who's in there?
- Mellowes, Lynch...
Tom Barry, Oscar Traynor.
Keep it off.
Why?
There's a gunman outside by the railings.
Jesus' sake.
They won't shoot me, then.
Jesus, what are you doing to me?
They can shoot us, but they can't get us.
- What are you talking about?
- It's not possible.
I'm going to live to see you old.
I am old.
Old enough to see your hair turn grey.
I come from a long line of baldies.
Bald, then.
I can live with that.
I will not fight against men I trained with,
I fought with!
The people have spoken for the treaty you brought home!
They've occupied the Four Courts,
Limerick, Cork. It's anarchy.
Better anarchy than civil war!
- Churchill offered artillery!
- He can do his own dirty work!
Maybe he will, Michael.
Maybe he will.
Stop!
- It's not safe...
- Do as you're told.
Harry, talk to me, will you?
I don't want any bullshit, Mick.
Neither do l.
Come upstairs.
Is it true what I heard?
You're engaged?
Should I apologize for that, too?
No, no, no.
I'm happy for you both.
Me arse. You don't look it.
Maybe I don't, but I'm trying.
Do you understand? I'm trying.
I miss the way it used to be.
Me too.
I hear you're Dev's right-hand man.
Well, I suppose that's how it goes.
We were too dangerous together.
Know the funny thing, Harry?
For the first time in my life, I'm scared.
The Big Fella, scared?
I hate to say it, Mick, but you've a right to be.
You don't understand me.
You told me once
I was good at bloody mayhem.
Right.
I left the Brits in the halfpenny place.
That's what I'm scared of, because once I start... there'll be no stopping me.
Don't let it start, then.
Tear up that treaty.
It's the only thing we've got.
So, then it starts.
What?
We fight.
They fight. We don't.
You've said what you had to say and you can go now.
Listen, you don't know what you're saying!
I have nothing more to say to you!
- Do it!
- Put the gun down!
Save us all a lot of bother. Do it!
Put the gun down.
Do you not hear me!
I said put the gun down!
Get out!
- Do it!
- Fire!
How would you like a new boss, Joe?
Check the other side.
What happened?
They shot their way to the Catacombs.
He thinks Harry was with them.
- Let's go.
- Mick, it's not safe!
We'll never get through!
Stop!
Stop!
Come on! Come on!
Calm down! It's the Big Fella!
What happened?
Who closed your eyes?
He tried to run across the river, sir.
I plugged him.
I didn't ask you. I asked him.
You asked who?
I fucking asked him!
- But he's dead, sir.
- And you killed him, you little git!
You plugged him, you Free State gob-shite!
- You were meant to protect him!
- He was one of them, sir!
No, sonny! You don't understand.
He was one of us.
Go on!
Back to your posts.
The papers said his last words were:
"Have they got Mick Collins yet?"
You know it's not true, Mick.
I don't know anything, anymore.
Tell Dev Mick wants to talk.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Not in Dublin.
Where, then?
West Cork... there might be a chance.
He'd never get out of there alive.
Doesn't he come from there?
That's bandit country.
They're bandits he trained, aren't they?
Maybe.
But Mick doesn't know the new boys.
He'll have to get to know them now.
Gentlemen.
What time is it?
Seven. Have you been here all night?
Any news?
They say if you went to Cork there might be a possibility.
Fuck!
What do you think?
We've cleared them out except for West Cork.
They wouldn't kill me in my own county.
How would you like a new boss, Joe?
Still, be nice to go home.
- You'd be crazy to go.
- So, I'm crazy.
Get the convoy together.
Go on.
- What?
- Here. For the cough.
Here. New handkerchief.
Go on! You're like an old clucking hen, fussing all the time!
Sweet suffering Jesus!
If you're going down, I'm going too.
That's where it all started, Joe.
Fenian stories by the fireside.
That's your home?
Was, till the Tans burned it.
What are you doing here, Mick?
Haven't I a civil war to run?
Come on! It's my round.
Come to flog us that bloody treaty, have you?
I'm flogging fuck-all.
I've come to buy.
Drinks for the county on me.
Come on, four pints.
Is it him?
Looks like it.
Looks like he wants to meet.
Can I trust him?
Can you trust anyone these days, chief?
"Oh, well do I remember...
"the year of '48
"When I rose with comrades brave and true
"l was hunted through the hills by slaves
"Who served a foreign queen
"And that's
"Another reason why
"I left old Skibereen"
Say it to me, kid.
Put it away, Joe.
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck am l?
I'm the fucker that asked to meet Dev.
And who's Dev?
And who are you?
If I did know this Dev, what would you say to him?
Tell him...
Harry Boland's death was enough.
Tell him Mick Collins wants to stop this bloody mayhem.
Tell him I'm sorry
I didn't bring back the Republic.
But nobody could have!
He was my chief, always.
I'd have followed him to hell if he'd asked me.
And maybe I did.
But it's not worth fighting for anymore.
We've got to build with what we have!
You tell him that.
Where can he find you?
Here.
So, I take it you heard?
Jesus, Mick.
God forgive us, Harry.
Have you got any reply?
He's come all this way.
Be rude not to give him an answer.
Well?
He says he'll meet you tomorrow.
What's wrong with now?
His nerves are at him.
Beal Na Blath. A farmhouse to the left on the Bandon side.
Around 12:00.
Hey kid...what's your name?
Little snot.
Beal Na Blath?
Should I ask them all to the wedding?
Do you think that'd fix it?
Be a big bloody wedding, Mick.
We'll invite the whole country.
Marital diplomacy.
Dev as best man. Lloyd George,
Winston Churchill as bridesmaids.
What's up?
We're stopped?
Roadblock.
Move it!
Get those carts off the road!
How long?
Two minutes.
Jeez, they're trying to fucking kill me.
Get down!
Give it to me! Get off!
No! Jeez, Mick!
Talk to me!
Don't go!
Don't go, Mick!
Jesus, don't go on us, Mick! Please!
Miss Kiernan?
I'm sorry.
I just heard.
I'm sorry.
That's why he died, Kitty.
He knew the risk he was taking to go there.
But he thought it worth taking.
He took them for us.
For every gob-shite in this country, no matter what side.
If he saw you now, know what he'd say?
"Get off the parliamentary side of your arse and get some color".
He would have said it better, Joe.
"No regrets, Kit".
That's what he'd say.
Wu.
You and your brothers murdered three of our men.
He would have done the same.
Send three more and I'll kill them, too.
He already controls the opium trade all across Asia.
May no one prosper but Ying Ko?
My poppy fields are tiny.
Nothing compared to his.
I, Li Peng, at least I'm entitled to my little piece.
Ying Ko, if you kill me, I promise... my brothers will come for you.
And I promise you...
I'll bury them beside you.
Kill him.
Let me go. I only wish to leave.
I'll cut his throat.
Your men are not marksmen enough to shoot around him.
You're right.
You're right.
Wu, you are a wonderful friend.
- Like a father to me.
- Thank you, Ying Ko.
Shoot through him.
Where are you taking me?
A Tulku wishes to see you at his temple.
A holy man wants to see me?
- You call that a temple?
- No.
There.
Where did that come from?
The clouded mind sees nothing.
- Who are you?
- I am your teacher.
Do you have any idea who you just kidnapped?
Cranston.
Lamont Cranston.
You know my real name?
Yes.
I also know that for as long as you can remember... you struggled against your own black heart and always lost.
You watched your spirit, your very face, change... as the beast claws its way out from within you.
You are in great pain, aren't you?
You know what evil lurks in the hearts of men... for you have seen that evil in your heart.
Every man pays the price for redemption.
This is yours.
- I'm not looking for redemption.
- You have no choice.
You will be redeemed... because I will teach you to use your black shadow to fight evil.
I wouldn't do that.
Phurba!
Am I in hell?
Not yet.
Get him, Johnny.
Maxie.
- Let's get this over with.
- Get out.
- No!
- Come on!
- Please, I didn't see anything.
- Quit your whining.
- Is it dry?
- Please.
- Perfect, Duke.
- Bring him to the rail.
I won't tell anyone. I swear.
Geez.
I wish I could trust you, sport.
I really do.
I guess you just picked the wrong alley to look down.
- I have a family.
- They'll get over it.
I won't talk. I'm telling you.
I know you won't.
Dump him.
- No. No!
- I hate heavy lifting.
No!
- What in Christ was that?
- Who's there?
Show yourself.
- You murdered a policeman, Duke.
- Who said that?
Duke, who said that?
- Shut up!
- The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.
I don't like this. This stinks.
Let's get the hell outta here!
- Shut your hole, Maxie!
- Did you think you'd get away with it?
Come on, Duke!
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Duke, I think you got him.
You're damn right I...
You committed murder, Duke.
- Now you're going to confess to it.
- Like hell I will.
You will, because if you don't, I'll be there.
I'll be there, around every corner... in every empty room, as inevitable as your guilty conscience.
You don't scare me, you son of a...
You will go to the eighth precinct house on Second Avenue... and surrender yourself, and you will do it now.
I confess! I'll do it!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'll confess! For God's sake,
I don't wanna die.
No!
No! No!
Drive!
Thank you.
You are probably busy.
You can just drop me off anywhere...
You're Dr. Roy Tam, a professor in the Science Department at N.Y.U.
- Yes.
- I've saved your life, Roy Tam.
- It now belongs to me.
- It does?
You'll become one of my agents... like dozens of others all over the world.
Could I ask my wife about this?
No!
Mr. Shrevnitz here will instruct you... in the way in which I will contact you should I require your help.
When you hear one of my agents say,
"The sun is shining"... you will respond,
"But the ice is slippery."
This will identify you to each other.
Do you understand?
"The sun is shining."
"But the ice is slippery."
Tell me one thing.
How did you know what was happening to me?
How did you know who I am?
The Shadow knows.
Thank you. That's the Shadow!
- I mean, that's the Shadow!
- You're a pretty smart guy.
I heard rumors in the paper, on the radio.
But I thought it was just talk.
I didn't think he existed.
He doesn't. Get it?
Don't ever take it off.
Wait a minute. Who are you?
Somebody who owes him his life.
Somebody just like you.
Boss, you okay?
The Cobalt Club.
Sorry I'm late, Uncle Wainwright, but there was a little... accident on the bridge.
I didn't think you wanted me to wait.
Incidentally, try the prime rib.
It's excellent.
Your usual, Mr. Cranston.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
You know, Lamont,
I'm very upset with you.
- What is it this time?
- What is it this time?
What is it every time?
You ask me to dinner and show up an hour late.
- There's no excuse...
- Uncle Wainwright, I'm sorry, I...
I got caught up.
With what, for God's sake?
You don't do anything.
A man your age is unseemly.
At least pick a hobby or something.
Why am I talking to the back of your neck?
Lamont? Lamont?
Sorry. What were we talking about?
I've never meddled in your affairs, going back to the time... after the war when you disappeared for some seven years.
I never asked questions then. I'm not now.
Excuse me, Police Commissioner Barth.
Urgent message for you, sir.
What's the matter?
Cops and robbers business slowing down?
It's a report of that damned
Shadow character again.
You said he was only a rumor.
I'm sick of this Shadow business, his meddling in police affairs.
This time tomorrow,
I'll put a task force on him.
You're not going to appoint a task force.
No. Hell with him.
I'm not going to appoint a task force.
You're not going to pay any attention to these reports of the Shadow.
- Ignore them entirely.
- There is no Shadow.
There is no Shadow.
If there were, I'd be Eleanor Roosevelt.
Where was I?
You were about to tell me who she is.
That's Margo Lane.
Her father is a scientist working for the War Department.
What the hell do you see in her?
Uncle Wainwright, are you sure you're not dead?
Not by a long shot.
Send a bottle of Mouton Rothschild, 1928, to that table.
Do yourself a favor. Stay away from her.
She's strange.
She hears voices. That's what they say.
Really?
Yes, I would like a glass of the Mouton...
Rothschild, 1928.
- Yes.
- From the gentleman.
Gentleman?
Lamont Cranston.
May I sit?
You know... it's the strangest thing, but I have this... sudden craving for Peking duck.
That's so odd.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Care to join me?
You speak Chinese.
Only Mandarin.
Aren't you full of surprises?
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.
- I had it made at Adrian's.
- Why did you just tell me that?
You just complimented me on my dress just now.
Didn't you?
No, I didn't.
But I was thinking it.
Now that hasn't happened to me in a long time.
Since I was a little girl with my cousin,
I could hear what he was thinking.
Just pick the thoughts right out of his head before he said a word.
It was the strangest thing.
And I never was able...
Is something bothering you?
Oh! No.
Not at all.
Thank you. I had a wonderful time.
I'm not sure I can recall an evening as... stimulating.
Good night, Miss Lane.
Good night, Mr. Cranston.
I like her, boss.
She's different than your usual dames.
- More than even she knows.
- How's that?
She has abilities she's completely unaware of.
No kidding?
You gonna see her again?
- No, it's much too dangerous.
- Dangerous for who?
For me, Moe.
For me.
Someone's coming.
- What is it?
- That's just it, sir. I don't know.
I'd have labeled it a mummy case coming from Tibet like it did.
- Mummy cases come from Egypt.
- That's right. Exactly.
Besides, the thing is metal, which made me think it was a sarcophagus.
No. Tibetan sarcophagi were of stone.
What happened to the truck men who dropped it off?
Gone.
It's obviously an incorrect shipment.
Call our customs broker and...
My God!
This is beautiful!
This is solid silver.
Nelson, help us take the sides off.
- What does it say?
- It's Latin.
"Kha Khan dei potestas in terra..."
"The power of God on Earth..."
"The seal of the emperor of mankind."
Oh, my God!
Temujin.
This is the silver coffin of Temujin.
Who's Temujin?
The man who very nearly conquered the globe eight centuries ago.
How come I never heard of him?
Temujin was the birth name... of Genghis Khan.
What was the shipper's address?
It didn't say.
Label just had the country of origin.
Let me make a telephone call.
Let me help you.
Nelson, whatever you do... don't open it.
No, sir.
- We're closed.
- Join me... or die.
Excuse me?
Join me or die.
This is private property.
- Your mind is weak.
- Don't come any closer.
Fall to your knees.
Put your gun to your temple.
Sacrifice yourself... to me.
Yes, my Khan.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it.
We were only gone for a moment.
You didn't hear me, did you?
I'm through with the beryllium sphere.
I'm just doing some underwater tests to check pressure.
Farley, I have told you a dozen times, we are doing energy research.
I'm not interested in any military application of the project.
Why'd you let the War Department pay all the bills?
'Cause you talked me into it.
I just wanted enough money to finish.
Dr. Lane, you don't think big.
If you'd only listen to me, the world could be our oyster.
Oysters? I get a rash from oysters.
Oh! Margo.
What a beautiful dress.
And such a clever neckline.
Excuse me, Mr. Claymore,
I'd like to see my father.
So... when are you gonna come down and see my beryllium sphere?
I'm not interested in your spheres.
Margo.
You don't return my calls anymore.
That's not true.
- I never did return your calls.
- I know.
I can't imagine why.
It's because I don't like you.
What a fascinating woman!
Dad, I don't know how you can work with that man.
Margo!
What a nice surprise.
- Hi.
- Have you had your dinner?
Yes, Dad. It's 2:00 a.m.
Where did you get this shirt?
You said I look good in green.
No, this is green. That's red.
Red, green.
To me, it's just a clean shirt.
Dad?
Do you believe in telepathy?
I mean, do you believe that it can exist between certain people?
You mean mind reading?
Of course I don't. I'm a scientist.
So strange.
I've always had this feeling that there was this... indescribable connection out there... just waiting for me.
And suddenly tonight, there it was.
That's nice.
What was it?
It was a man.
And I'm probably never gonna see him again.
But why not?
I just know.
It was as though I could sense what he was feeling.
And now I'm completely and utterly depressed.
That's nice.
Okay, that'll be $4.45.
- What are you doing?
- Writing down the drop-off point.
You are making a record of my destination?
Taxi commission's rules.
All right, Reilly, back her up.
That's it.
You need fuel.
Geez, I need gas.
Cut left. That's it.
Hey, thanks.
Look out!
This must be my lucky...
Call an ambulance!
Scott, you all right?
Hey, stay back! Stay back!
Help over here!
What's going on?
Inspector Cardon is in charge, sir.
He's over there.
Hey, what are you, crazy?
- Out!
- Thank you.
To the sanctum.
Go!
Come on, what are you gonna do, park it here? Come on!
Hey, Louie, save that cab for me!
- Report.
- Our agent in the 26th precinct... reports police investigation of murder at the Museum of Natural History.
Murder.
Agent advises inquiry.
Understood.
I saw you as taller.
Who are you?
Shiwan Khan.
Last descendant of Genghis Khan.
You are naturally deeply honored.
Don't feel obligated to introduce yourself.
I already know who you are.
Not this temporary version of yourself.
I know who you really are.
Ying Ko.
I'm a great admirer.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please.
It is no more difficult for me to invade your mind than it was this room.
May I sit?
You are hurting my feelings, Ying Ko.
I should have thought you would enjoy to meet another... with the unique ability to cloud men's minds.
- You were a student of the Tulku.
- Yes.
He spoke of you constantly.
But I'm afraid he wasn't able to turn me quite as easily.
Would you happen to have some American bourbon?
I have a bit of a taste for it.
- I'm happy to pay, of course.
- No.
Not at all.
Say, you didn't happen by any chance to... pay a visit to the museum last night, did you?
A wonderful collection of Tibetan tapestries.
Grown men still shiver at your name.
You are, I have to confess, my idol.
Your raid on the village of Barga?
I studied it.
How nice. You remember it.
It rings a bell.
It was a masterstroke.
Swift, vicious, and sudden.
What genius.
So, what brings you to the Big Apple?
My destiny.
Genghis Khan conquered half of the world in his lifetime.
I intend to finish the job.
And how do you plan to do that?
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.
I traveled to this country in Genghis Khan's holy crypt... to absorb his power.
In three days, the entire world will hear my roar... and willingly fall subject to the lost empire of Sianking.
That is a lovely tie, by the way.
- May I ask where you acquired it?
- Brooks Brothers.
- Is that Midtown?
- 45th and Madison.
You are a barbarian.
Thank you.
We both are.
I know that inside you beats a heart of darkness.
You dip into it every time you put on that hat and cloak.
Join me.
You are Ying Ko, the Butcher of Lhasa.
You and only you deserve to be by my side.
Together, we'll pit armies against one another like a chess game.
We'll collect our due of pain and we'll wash our hands in blood.
Your mouth still waters at real power.
I am offering you a chance to take it back.
Be my partner, Ying Ko.
That's not my name anymore.
But it is! Nevertheless, still who you are, isn't it?
For the bourbon.
We will meet again, soon.
The day of the Mongol warrior... is once again at hand.
Soon, with wings outstretched... we fly to our destiny!
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America.
Flash: Manhattan reels from yet another report of the elusive Shadow.
I think they made up the Shadow so people would listen to the radio more.
What do you think, Roy?
Some say the Shadow is...
Roy?
Well, it...
I'll get it.
Yes?
"The sun is shining."
"But the ice is slippery."
- You're an agent of the Shadow.
- Who?
Yeah. Right. Gotcha.
What do you need?
I need a metal analysis of this.
Bronzium.
The metal is bronzium.
I didn't think it existed, but here it is.
The ancient Chinese believed this was the very stuff the universe was formed of.
- Where did it come from?
- I'm told it came from Sianking.
If you believed in legends, it had to be Sianking.
They called it the birthplace of the world.
Could bronzium conceivably be used to make some sort of a weapon?
Theoretically, yes.
How?
Supposedly, it's very unstable on the molecular level... constantly given to expansion.
Only the cell bonds hold it in check, but if the bonds were ever breached.
- By an explosion?
- It wouldn't do it.
But if the power of the cell were to turn on itself in an implosion... the molecular imbalance will be released and then you'll have your explosion.
How big?
No man can say.
The breakdown would spread to all levels of the cells' atomic construction.
Fashioned into a bomb, it would be catastrophic.
I guess you'd call it an implosive-explosive submolecular device.
Or an atomic bomb.
Hey, that's catchy.
But it'd have to have a beryllium sphere to contain the apparatus.
No other metal would enhance a blast.
In any case, it's all moot.
None of this would be possible... unless... some genius figures out how to design and make it.
The implosive device.
It would have to be sort of a shell... with tiny implosive charges regularly spread over the surface.
Something like this.
Fortunately... such a device doesn't exist.
Reinhardt Lane.
Reinhardt Lane.
Reinhardt Lane.
Reinhardt Lane.
Yes, my Khan.
You know something, Lamont, that puzzles me?
How a man like yourself who has absolutely nothing to do... can be late for every little engagement.
Practice, Uncle Wainwright.
Lots and lots of practice.
Waiter, get me some more chives, would you, please?
Oh, my God, here comes that Lane woman.
I don't need her anymore, I...
- Hi, Miss Lane. How are you?
- You can drop the act, Commissioner.
- What have you done about my father?
- Nothing we can do unless...
Unless what? He blows himself up?
Margo Lane, my nephew, Lamont Cranston.
Yes, we've met.
Would you care to join us?
The fact that your father is acting strangely...
I don't think really calls for a police investigation.
I wanna see him.
The War Department says... he suddenly decided to take no visitors, not even his own daughter.
Chances are he's working on some top secret.
- It is a government project, you know.
- No, his project is harmless.
Energy research.
Some kind of implosive device.
Look, I know something's wrong.
I spoke to him on the phone.
He was distant, confused, babbling.
He spoke to me in Chinese!
Waiter, waiter.
- He doesn't even speak Chinese!
- I'm sorry, please.
Tomorrow, I'll send a policeman over to the federal building.
He'll see your father and everything'll be fine, all right?
What's your opinion...
Excuse me.
Lamont!
Wait a second, Lamont.
I wanted to ask you about my father.
I have to go.
Ying Ko! Who's Ying Ko?
You will forget about me.
- Why would I do that?
- You will give me no further thought.
Are you drunk?
I don't know what kind of woman you're used to dealing with... but I don't appreciate being...
Hey!
The federal building.
You got it, boss.
- Pizza?
- Yuck.
I'm not going to eat a burger again.
I'm not asking you to eat a burger.
- You like fish?
- How about a burger?
Next time, you get to be on top.
- Where is Khan?
- I will not tell you.
What are you doing?
Hold on or you'll die!
Yes, to serve my Khan.
I sense somebody's coming.
Drive!
- Hello?
- Hello, Margo.
Dad.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
I need to see you right away at the lab.
Are you there now?
Hurry.
No, no, no!
Oh, God! Dad!
Dad! Where are you?
Oh, God, no!
Margo Lane.
I have a mission for you, my dear.
Margo Lane.
- What are you doing here?
- You're in my home.
I am? Your home?
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.
- Who sent you?
- I don't know!
- Who sent you?
- I don't know!
There was a voice over and over in my head.
It said I had to kill the Shadow.
I want you to leave right now.
I had to kill the Shadow and I came here.
I said I want you to leave right now.
And there was only you.
Get out!
Let me see into your eyes.
- You want to see into my eyes?
- I think...
- Go ahead. Look at them.
- I know something I knew before.
Something strange about you.
I could feel it.
But I've got to warn you.
You won't like what you see.
The static in my head whenever I was near you. I knew it.
You're the Shadow!
My father's disappeared. You're the only one who can help me find him.
Just be gone when I get back.
How do you know I won't tell anyone who you really are?
I know.
To the sanctum.
- Nice tie.
- Thank you.
By the way... you sent Margo Lane to kill me.
Kill you?
If I wanted you dead, Ying Ko,
I would've had your liver on a pole by now.
I sent the girl to be killed.
Tell me how did you kill her?
- She's alive.
- Then she's a danger to you.
She now knows exactly who you are.
How long will you let her live?
How long before your pure instincts take over?
I'm onto your plan.
You still don't have the beryllium sphere.
Without it, you can't complete the bomb.
Besides, you know I'm gonna stop you.
You Americans are so arrogant.
You think your meaningless, decadent country... is the new cradle of civilization.
- Let me tell you something...
- That's the U.S. of A. You're talking about.
I am talking about ruling the world!
I'd like to give you a name.
Leonard Levinsky. Brilliant psychiatrist.
- You'll talk, he'll listen...
- You are boring me!
- That knife.
- Recognize it?
I took it from the Tulku.
No, I correct myself.
I took it out of the Tulku after I ran it through his heart.
When will you learn to listen to your instincts?
Instincts?
I'll show you my instincts.
Never did master the Phurba, did you?
Still expect it to respond to brute force.
My Mongol warriors aren't terribly bright... but they are loyal.
Accept the truth.
There is no light without shadow.
And you and I are that shadow.
I would sooner destroy a Rembrandt than kill you.
For the last time, will you join me?
You cannot fool me.
You cannot defeat me.
- Your mind is an open book to me.
- Then learn how to read!
Weakling!
Tail them, Moe.
He's disappeared, boss.
Stop the car.
It's just an empty lot, boss.
I can't help that I know what I know about you.
And I can't forget it either.
It's late.
Sleep here if you like.
There are guest rooms.
But in the morning, you should go.
I'm not afraid of you.
But I am.
Lamont?
Lamont?
Lamont?
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh, God, I dreamed.
So did I.
What did you dream?
I was lying naked on the beach in the South Seas.
The tide was coming up over my toes.
The sun was beating down.
My skin was... hot and cool at the same time.
It was wonderful.
What was yours?
I dreamed I tore all the skin off my face and was somebody else underneath.
You have problems.
I'm aware of that.
I'll wait outside while you get dressed.
That's okay. You can stay.
These are all rumpled.
There might be some things in here that you could use.
Yeah. This belonged to my aunt Rose.
- Really?
- Very fashionable gal, that Rose.
Kept her figure, too.
I've got to run. I've got a...
- Taxi waiting downstairs?
- Excuse me?
I sensed that's what you were gonna say.
It is, isn't it?
Yes.
This is getting easier the more I'm around you.
You're like reading a book.
Thank you, but I won't be needing that taxi.
- You do. I have a very important...
- Great. I'll come with you.
- No! Last night we agreed...
- No, I didn't agree to anything.
Do you mind if I get one little sentence out here?
We agreed you were going to leave this morning.
No, you agreed I was going to leave.
I agreed to no such thing.
- We need each other.
- No.
- We have a connection.
- No.
Then explain why I can read your thoughts.
- My thoughts are hard to miss.
- Why?
- Psychically, I'm very well-endowed.
- I'll bet you are.
Okay, so you don't need me, but I need you to help me find my father.
And I am coming with you.
Okay.
Empire state building pennants!
Get your empire state building pennants!
From there to there.
That is just the explosion.
The destruction will be incalculable.
Good.
What a beautiful day.
Nice dress, toots.
- "Come on along and listen to..."
- Get me down!
Bobby! What are you doing?
I have no idea! Get me down!
- Get me down from here!
- "...The Lullaby of Broadway."
Get me down!
It's all falling into place for me now.
Shiwan Khan needs a beryllium sphere to complete the bomb.
- I wonder where he intends to find one?
- Beryllium sphere?
Beryllium sphere! Farley Claymore!
- What's that?
- Farley Claymore, my father's assistant.
- He was working on a beryllium sphere.
- In your father's lab?
No, he was working on his own.
Mari-Tech labs, down on the south side.
- Good, very good.
- Get outta the way!
I got something else
I want you to do for me.
I was trailing Khan when I lost him on the corner of Second and Houston.
There's something strange about that vacant lot.
Find out what used to be there.
Second and Houston.
What about Farley Claymore?
Mr. Claymore's gonna receive a little visit from the Shadow.
- Farley Claymore!
- Who's there?
Where is the beryllium sphere, Claymore?
Sphere?
What sphere?
Claymore, you idiot!
You're being manipulated.
Your mind is being controlled by hypnosis.
My mind? Controlled?
What have you done with the sphere?
It's too late. I loaded it on a truck.
Take me to it now!
Who do you think you're gonna shoot with that, Claymore?
No one controls my mind, Shadow!
There's a new world order coming, and I'm gonna be a king.
A king!
Margo.
Margo, I need you.
Open the door.
You called?
Lamont?
You're not supposed to be here.
Lamont?
You were dreaming.
You saw.
Do you have any idea... what it's like to have done things you can never forgive yourself for?
Whoever you were... whatever you did... it's in the past.
Not for me, Margo.
Never for me.
We are victorious!
And as victors, we will collect the spoils of war.
I will remember each of you... particularly my special servant... the only American with genius enough... to join me of his own free will... who saw himself a king in my kingdom.
King? Did I say king?
- Maybe not the best choice of words.
- No, it wasn't.
Because actually,
I was thinking prince, tops.
Not even, necessarily. Duke? Baron?
Your choice, of course.
- Get Dr. Lane. Assemble the bomb.
- Of course.
In the name of the new Kha Khan!
The power of God on Earth!
The emperor of mankind!
Extra! Read all about it!
Madman threatens to blow the city sky-high!
Residents of New York City were thrown into a virtual panic today.
Police were still trying to determine if, in fact, the threat was real... or merely an incredible hoax.
Either way, surely the work of a madman.
Morning, Russell.
He's demanded works of art, famous jewels, even gold.
Find Khan and you'll find the bomb.
What did you find out about that lot?
Not much. It was the site of the old Hotel Monolith.
It was finished nearly 10 years ago, but it never opened.
The Monolith. I vaguely remember that.
Seems that's the only way anybody remembers it.
Before the hotel was completed... the developer went bankrupt and committed suicide.
The last record is a sale to a Far Eastern buyer six years ago.
- When was it torn down?
- It doesn't say.
I made some calls this morning to newspapers and such.
All anybody can remember is up to the time it was sold.
Everyone seems to know that it was torn down... but they can't remember when or by whom.
Or if.
I can't believe he did it.
Did what? Lamont?
My God.
It's beautiful.
What is?
Hey, that building right there.
What's the name of that building?
Lunatic!
Shiwan Khan has hypnotized the entire city.
They don't see it.
None of them see it.
But I see it.
You and Shrevnitz will receive your instructions.
- I want you to follow them exactly.
- Lamont!
Bet you wish you'd been a little nicer to me now, don't ya?
Bet you wish you'd listened to my ideas.
Bet you didn't count on me being friends with a conqueror, did ya?
That's enough. Activate the bomb.
Set the timer for two hours.
You are certain you could duplicate this bomb's design anytime I require?
Absolutely. No problem.
That makes Dr. Lane obsolete.
Secure him in a room.
He will die at the hands of his own invention.
Yes, my Khan.
I know you must have this covered, but shouldn't we be getting out of here?
There's an aeroplane waiting to take us all to safety. We leave in one hour.
What is it, Moe?
Is it another one from the bowling league?
Ying Ko.
The Shadow! Where?
Not here, you idiot. In the building.
Can you tell if he's mad at me?
We had a little misunderstanding yesterday... and there might still be hard feelings.
Find him and kill him!
Kill him? Me?
All of you!
Couldn't I just stay here and help you?
Go!
You guys, go that way.
Did you think you'd never see me again?
Claymore
I'm right here!
All around you.
Everywhere around you.
Coward.
Chicken! Sissy!
Come out here and fight like a man.
You're a fool, Claymore.
Get out of my sight!
There's your exit, Claymore.
You know what I love about this job?
The excitement.
Ying Ko. I surrender.
You're finished, Khan.
Phurba!
You are losing your concentration.
Your mind is too weak.
You are beginning to lose your power.
Look at you. Can't even control yourself.
How can you hope to control the Phurba?
Stop!
- My God.
- That's what he saw.
Where am I?
Khan!
- Dad!
- Margo!
- Where am I? What is going on here?
- Are you all right?
Well, there's this guy...
- I'll tell you later. Call the police.
- Okay.
Look! There it is!
Oh, my God! This is impressive work.
- Who did this?
- You did.
We only have an hour left. Disconnect it!
Cut this off.
Dad, the timer! You gotta stop it!
Oh, dear.
Two minutes left.
Oh, my God! Hurry!
This way!
Oh, my God, it's upstairs.
Oh, no, the elevator!
Dad!
Be careful.
No!
- Which wire?
- I just don't remember!
Pick one!
What the hell. It's usually green.
No, green!
This is green. That's red.
I've gotta try to remember that.
What are you doing?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Where the hell did that come from?
What is this?
Where am I?
You. Come here.
Look at me.
Look into my eyes.
Yes.
Release me at once.
No, we won't have any of that, Mr. Khan.
Let's just have a look at those stitches.
Stitches? What have you done?
Saved your life, that's what.
We had to remove a little section of your frontal lobe.
You'll never miss it.
It's a part nobody ever uses.
But...
Unless you believe in telepathy!
Wait! Come back here!
You! Come here!
I am Shiwan Khan, the last descendant of Genghis Khan! Listen to me!
- I'm Houdini!
- I'm Theodore Roosevelt!
- I am Napoleon!
- I'm Josephine!
- I'm Babe Ruth!
- I'm Henry VIII!
I'm William Shakespeare!
I'll see you later.
Hey, how will you know where I am?
I'll know.
I've got you now, wizard.
Get him!
Search every bush and tree!
Lerigot must be caught!
He's over there! Hurry!
Come on!
Easy now. He's close by.
Keep your eyes open.
There!
There's no escape, Lerigot!
It's all over, wizard!
Surrender to Divatox!
Fools! You let him escape!
COACH: Come on, Rocky!
Focus, Rocky! Focus!
Tommy! Follow-through!
Your follow-through!
Rocky, get back in there. Let's go!
All right. Get in there! Get in there!
Watch out. Come on, move!
Adam, get in there!
All right! Get in there!
Rocky, spinning-heel kick! My hand!
No. Look, you're trying too hard.
CHILDREN: # Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream #
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream #
# Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream... #
- Come on, Justin. You know the words.
- I don't feel like singing.
- Do you want to talk about it?
- There's nothing to talk about.
I just don't feel like singing.
OK.
Hey, Rocky. Maybe we are trying too hard.
Maybe we're not trying hard enough.
- Don't move.
- My back!
- Can we get some help?!
- It's gonna be all right.
- Just relax.
- Man, I'm so stupid!
- You're OK, man. Just calm down.
- Don't worry. Help is on its way.
Yeah, that was cool.
Rocky!
Justin, wait!
- Everyone, wait here. It'll be OK.
- KAT: Rocky!
Wait here.
- You'll be OK.
- Hang in there, pal.
Idiots!
You're worthless! And you!
- Me?!
- You lost Lerigot.
You let him get away.
I told you those bolt-brains didn't have a clue.
- Oh, shut up, Elgar!
- Whoa!
Those are your bolt-brains, which makes this all your fault.
Come on, don't punish me.
I'm your favourite nephew.
Phew.
Hey, you two losers,
I nearly got fired for your screw-up!
You're just lucky
Aunt Divatox likes me. Whoa!
- Not again!
- Never send a moron to do a mutant's job.
If you're so great, why don't you do the job, Rygog?
That runt Lerigot is still out there with the key to the island of Muiranthias!
No, thanks. But I'd be happy to lend a hand.
Oh, yeah. Real funny.
- Quiet! Both of you!
- Sorry.
You're giving me such a migraine.
I have a plan.
Once we take away the one thing he values most in the world,
Lerigot will come to us willingly.
Where's my Eely? Where is he?
BABY: Come to Mommy! Come here!
There's my boy! Yes!
I have a date with destiny.
I want Lerigot's family captured and bought here.
Yes, give Mommy a kiss. Yes. ( sniggers )
Oh... Oh...
Argh!
- ( growl )
- Argh!
Alpha... Alpha...
Alpha...
Alpha?
Alpha... Alpha...
Ai yi yi. Zordon! Lerigot, the wizard of Liaria, is here on Earth!
Zordon? Zordon, where are you?!
I'm here, Alpha.
Zordon, you scared the diodes out of me!
I'm sorry, Alpha. I too sensed the arrival of
Lerigot ans was tracking his whereabouts.
But why would he come here? He knows he can't survive on Earth for very long.
Something must be terribly wrong. Pinpoint his location and contact the Rangers.
- If Lerigot is in trouble, we must help him.
- Right. Beginning a worldwide search now.
Rocky?
Hey!
- Brought you a surprise.
- There you go. How you doin'?
- Got you a card.
- And some decoration.
- The doctor said you'd make a full recovery.
- Yeah, but not in time for the competition.
- You guys are gonna have to go without me.
- We don't have a choice.
Without that prize money the shelter's gonna close for good.
You know, Justin's taking this pretty hard.
It's bad enough he lost his mother.
Now he has to face losing the shelter.
- Well, we're not gonna let that happen.
- ( communicators bleep )
- Go ahead.
- Rangers, report to the Power Chamber.
A powerful wizard has arrived on Earth and may be in danger.
We're on our way. Tommy out.
You guys heard Zordon.
What are you waiting for?
- All right. We'll let you know what's up.
- See you, Rocky.
- We'll be back, OK?
- Be careful.
- Ow!
- Who's there?
Justin?
Did you just hear all that?
You guys are the Power Rangers?
Lerigot has taken great pains to hide his exact location. Someone must be after him.
You must find him quickly.
- Tanya and I will stay here just in case.
- Good idea, Adam.
- This could be trouble. Keep an eye out.
- He is in Central Africa.
Equip yourselves with the Power Boxes and teleport there immediately.
- Right.
- He cannot survive the sun's rays.
Ai yi yi!
The short-range locators in your Power
Boxes should lead you to Lerigot. Good Luck.
- Ready?
- Let's go.
Ow!
Alpha?
Alpha?
Alpha...
I've found Lerigot. He's on Earth.
Yes! He must be looking for Zordon.
Excellent. You may kiss my hand. Gotcha!
Earth? Forget it. Let's go back to looting and pillaging. That's what I like!
Never! Lerigot holds the only key to free Maligore, the great flame of destruction and my husband-to-be.
Once we are wed, I will use his powers to raid all the riches of the universe.
Thinking about it just gives me goose bumps!
- Kinda gives me gas.
- Elgar!
You will head the capture of two... two humans of purity and strength.
They'll be my dowry to Maligore. Activate the barrier shields and set a course to Earth.
We're going after Lerigot!
Prepare to teleport!
Hey, hold it. What you got there?
- Just as I thought.
- What is this? Huh?
- I'll check these hot dogs.
- Bulkmeier! Skullovitch!
Beat it, kid.
Sir!
Men, listen up, because you know how I hate to repeat myself. I hate to repeat myself.
You just did, sir.
I needn't remind you of our luck in getting rehired, Men...
I have am important assignment for you.
It's am easy one, but one that will, uh...
- Skullovitch, are you listening to me?
- Yep, I'm with you, sir.
Well, listen to this. Precisely at 1900 hours, you relieve me from duty at the international danceathon. Do I make myself clear?
- Got it, sir!
- Yes, sir!
Would you mind, sir?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Napkin?
- Got one, sir. Thanks.
Wow. Reminds me of parts of Australia.
Got him. The signal's coming from... that direction. Let's go find him.
Wow, this is moving fast.
Adam, come check this out.
That object we're tracking just entered Earth's atmosphere. But its identity is being blocked.
It is likely the reason Lerigot cam to Earth.
An evil energy surrounds it.
Man, I've got a bad feeling about this.
I hope Tommy and Kat make it back soon.
Lt Stone is already gonna kill us for bein' late, so turn right!
Left! Left is north. North Star!
- Look at the stars there, man!
- That star?
- That star!
- That star is moving! Wanna make a wish?
- What the heck was that?!
- I dunno, but keep going!
- The accelerator's stuck!
- Whoa. Stop! Skull, slow down, man!
- I'm trying!
- Skull, there's a building up ahead.
Aaarghhh!
Lerigot's signal is gettin' stronger.
Tommy, do you mind if we stop for a minute?
- You OK?
- Yeah, it's just hot out here.
I know. Want some water?
We still have a lot of jungle to cover.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Man, this heat's intense.
Don't move.
On the count of three, jump away.
One.
Two.
Three!
Kat!
Tommy!
Kat!
Zeo Ranger One! Pink!
Kat!
Kat!
Kat!
Kat!
My leg!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yeah.
- My leg...
DIVATOX: What do you mean, you can't find Lerigot?!
And are these my humans of purity and strength?
Yeah. Check 'em out. I even scrambled their brains so they'd be easier to deal with. Ta-da!
- What do you think?
- Urrrgh!
Are you out of your mind?
- ( embarrassed laugh )
- The idea was to woo Maligore, not make him lose his lunch!
I am giving you one more chance.
Don't blow it.
Yes, ma'am. Hey, you heard the lady.
Go find me some more humans, you losers!
Oh, man.
We're headed in the right direction but the signal's gettin' fainter.
He must be weakening from the sun's heat.
Tommy, we've gotta hurry.
Let's go.
Look.
Lerigot.
Lerigot!
Alpha?
Alpha?
Yes.
Alpha.
My name is Tommy, and this is Katherine.
We're friends.
- We're here to take you to Alpha.
- Alpha...
My leg!
He healed my leg.
- Thank you, Lerigot.
- Let's get him outta here.
It's OK.
Alpha, we're standing by with Lerigot for teleportation.
Thank you.
Well, what do we have here?
Two humans, ripe for the picking, and they're heading our way! ( cackles )
Two perfect specimens, worthy of feeding my fiancÃ©.
Throw them into the bilge, where they'll stay fresh for Maligore.
It'll be my pleasure.
Now let's reel, in that little runt Lerigot.
He's probably with Zordon by now.
Remove the mind block.
We'll use his wife Yara to contact them both.
- Is he going to be all right?
- The sun has taken its toll on him.
- This should restore his life force... for now.
- I wonder who's after him.
( moaning ) Yara...
- What's happening?
- Tommy, wait.
Lerigot is receiving a telepathic transmission that is obviously upsetting him greatly.
Zordon, what should we do?
Perhaps if we find out what he is receiving, we can help him.
Alpha, attach the cranial transmission scanner and connect it to the viewing globe.
- Ai yi yi!
- Zordon, I know you can hear me, so listen well.
Lerigot must surrender.
Say hello to Lerigot's family.
Yara, loving wife, and caring mother to little baby Bethel.
Don't you just want to pinch those adorable cheeks?
- Ai yi yi yi yi!
- Make it stop! Look what it's doing to him!
Bring him to me. Oh, and by the way, as a token of my appreciation,
I'll spare a couple of your favourite humans.
They're certainly not much to look at, but my sensors tell me they were once one of your...
Oh, what do you call them?
Oh, yes. "Power Rangers."
- Kimberly.
- Do what I say or it's lights out for all of them.
And Jason.
Yara...
- Kim?
- Yeah?
I think we're in major trouble here.
I'd say.
Wish we could morph.
Doesn't look like there's any way out.
- Hola!
- Ja. Guten Tag.
( Spanish accent ) My name is Antonio Bandanna.
- Bulk?
- Skull?
( German accent ) You are speaking to us?
Who ees this "Bulk" and "Skull"?
- Something's strange with those two.
- You just figured that one out?
- They understand each other.
- As good friends should.
I don't understand it.
Why does Divatox want Lerigot?
I believe that Divatox plans to use Lerigot and his golden key to cross the treacherous Nemesis Triangle into another dimension.
Once there, she will likely travel to the lost island of Muiranthias and attempt to join forces with an evil creature named Maligore.
- Great. Then what?
- Then nothing will be safe.
- Even the Zords could not stop them.
- What? No!
- What's he doing?
- Ai yi yi!
He is performing the Liarian prayer of guidance. Lerigot is preparing to surrender.
- But why? We can't let him do that.
- It's his family, Kat.
- We'd do the same for each other.
- I just hope they're OK.
OK, listen. We'll get Kim and Jason out of there, then we'll go after Lerigot's family.
Kimberly and Jason were Power Rangers once. If anyone can get through it, they can.
Careful. Watch your step.
Look. There they are.
Warriors, let's ride!
Send Lerigot down!
No! Bring our friends closer first!
You have no choice, humans!
This is as close as you get!
Now send the wizard down!
I don't like it. We should stall them and figure something out.
Yeah, I think maybe you're right.
Lerigot's gone!
- Lerigot! No!
- Come back!
Come on, fur ball. Come to Elgar. ( sniggers )
All right! You have what you came for!
Let our friends go!
Swim for 'em! Arrivederci, turkeys!
All right, stop the boat.
You can dump them out right here.
Come and get 'em!
All right, take us back to the ship.
Move it!
I gotta go... I gotta go after 'em!
- No! It's a fake!
- Tommy! Tommy!
- I gotta check the other one.
- Tommy...
Come on. They're gone.
Tommy, come on! Come on!
- I gotta... gotta go after 'em...
- They tricked us.
Double, double rocks and rubble!
Abracadabra-cadabra- cadabra-cadabra-cadabra-whoo!
If only its magic would glow in my hands,
I would have no need for you.
You will oversee our safe passage into the Nemesis Triangle, won't you, twerp?
Set a course for me Nemesis Triangle!
Full speed ahead!
Once we get to the island of Muiranthias on the other side...
As I was saying.
- Once we get to the island of Muira...
- ( fly buzzing )
My Maligore's appetite will ignite once he sees the powerlicious offerings I've brought him.
Those two ex-Power Pukes will be the perfect wedding meal for my Maligore!
OK.
This is so lame. We come back to surprise everybody and help out with the shelter...
Next thing, we're snack food for a monster with the munchies.
Munchies?
Level stabilisers off at 8.40.
- Full throttle on the power output.
- OK, all systems go here.
The Zords you are creating will possess the power to carry you safely through the Nemesis Triangle to resuce Lerigot, his family and our friends.
Behold your new Turbo Zords.
They're just ordinary cars.
No, Tanya, they are extraordinary cars.
Vehicles equipped with the power and velocity of Turbo technology.
Individually, they are formidable fighting machines.
But merged together they form the Turbo
Megazord, the most powerful Zord ever.
Adam, Desert Thunder will be yours to command.
Katherine, yours is called Wind Chaser.
Tanya, Dune Star is your Turbo Zord.
And, Tommy,
Red Lightning will serve you well.
Thanks, Zordon.
- But what about Rocky's?
- Mountain Blaster will stay behind for now.
Remember, Rangers.
Once inside the Nemesis Triangle, communication with the Power Chamber will be impossible.
ZORDON: Here are your new Turbo morphers, five keys similar to Lerigot's golden key.
Individually, they power up your vehicles and give you access to your morphing powers.
But only together are they powerful enough to see you safely through your mission.
Now reach out, Rangers, and accept your destiny.
Ready?
Ready.
Go!
Whoa! I've never felt anything like this!
Wow! This is great!
- All right!
- This is awesome!
- Whoa! This is incredible!
- Yeah!
- All right, guys, let's go to work.
- Right behind you.
- Wait for me!
- Let's do it!
All systems check out. Your Zords are programmed and ready to go.
Take your Zords across the great desert to the sea. There you will find the Ghost Galleon, a phantom ship which will take you and the Zords through the Nemesis Triangle.
You must merge the power of your keys the moment you cross into the Triangle.
The combined power of your keys and the Galleon will see you through safely.
Neither the ship nor your Zords will be detectable by Divatox.
- Ai yi yi! Good luck, Rangers!
- Thanks, Alpha.
- Good luck, and may power protect you.
- All right, Rangers. Power up!
( # "Power Rangers Turbo, Go!" by Super Power )
# Go #
# Go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
- Man, this is awesome!
- Desert Thunder ready to rumble.
- Wind Chaser ready to howl.
- Dune Star's gonna shine.
- Red Lightning ready to bolt.
- ADAM: All systems go.
All right. Let's rip some velocity!
Shift into Turbo!
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
By accepting this honour, you are also accepting a great responsibility.
As the newest Ranger, you must take your lead from the others and learn to use your new powers wisely.
You will command the Mountain Blaster and be henceforth known as the Blue Ranger.
Good luck, and may the power protect you.
No Power Rangers in sight.
I knew Zordon would get it through his thick skull not to mess with me.
I'm no veterinarian, but I think it's dying.
Oh! We can't let that wretched Liarian thingy die till he opens the gateway to Muiranthias and frees my betrothed!
You guys? I hear the ocean, but... I don't see the ship.
I'll take a look up ahead.
I think I found it.
The Ghost Galleon.
It's amazing.
Hey, guys, check it out.
Rocky?
Wow. Cool.
Justin, what are you doing here?
- Rocky couldn't make it, so they sent me.
- What are you talking about?
- Guys, I'm the new Blue Ranger!
Isn't that cool or what?
- What?
- Man, I was afraid I wasn't gonna make it.
Alpha had to give me a crash course in driving.
Good thing you don't need a licence to drive a Zord.
So, what are we doing here?
We'll talk about this later. Right now we gotta get those cars on that ship.
Let's go.
- OK. Everybody on board?
- Yep, we're all here.
Let's check out the ship.
Hey, you guys, look at this!
I guess we should open it.
Looks like the portal keys also control the ship.
Let's do it.
Hey, the compass is moving.
- And the sails! They're all raising...
- By themselves!
# There's hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
# And as long as I exist #
# There's hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
- Do I look fat?
- Nah!
Hell's bells, what is going on now?
Sensors detect the presence of five humans, but no vessel.
What, are they swimmimg?
We're in the middle of the blasted ocean!
Whatever they're travelling on is totally undetectable.
Zordon's little Power Pukes, no doubt.
Why didn't the radar alert us?
I guess it needs fixing.
Never mind.
I'll just leave a little something for those Power Parasites to remember me by.
KAT: Justin, where are you?
- Justin?
- I'm over here.
Why don't you come down below with us?
It's getting pretty cold out here.
I'm way too excited to sleep.
I was just thinking.
If my dad only knew, man, he'd be so proud of me.
And all the other kids at the shelter...
- Justin, you can't...
- I know, I know.
It's for me to know and them to find out.
Ranger's code of honour.
- I won't tell anybody.
- Good.
I guess my dad's still up north.
He had to close down the martial-arts studio after my mom passed away.
Why'd he close it down?
He just... He just couldn't focus any more.
It was like something was missing inside him.
He'll find it again.
He just needs a little time, that's all.
I know. And when he does, we can be family again.
That's important.
Yeah, it is. But you have to remember that we've your family now too.
Come here.
OK. don't stay out too long.
Even Power Rangers need their sleep.
OK.
- He's OK.
- Good.
( croaking whisper ) Help...
Guys... Hey, guys...
OK, once we get there, we'll nead to the middle of the island...
Justin?
Adam, look out!
- Guys! It's time to rumble.
- Let's go.
Justin!
Look out!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Aw... Ugh!
Boo!
- This sure ain't the Love Boat.
- What's the Love Boat?
That's it. Kim, move away from the wall for a minute.
Um, sure.
Instead of making weapons, I think we ought to be concentrating on getting this panel off.
Wouldn't that mean all the water would come in?
Yeah. Right now my dive computer says we're at 435 feet.
As we get to Muiranthias, the sub's gonna climb.
Once we hit 100 feet, we pop this off the wall and "boom".
- And make it up in one breath?
- It's our only chance.
At last! We're finally approaching the Nemesis Triangle!
- Begin our ascent! We must avoid the reets!
- You got it.
- Wait till we cross the Triangle.
- We'd better pass through it quickly!
There it is. The Nemesis Triangle.
It's incredible.
Yeah. Whatever's steering the ship sure knows where to go.
Right into the heart of it.
It's time.
- The room's filling up! What's happening?
- I don't know!
We're minutes away from the dimensional gateway.
I don't know how much longer I can hold it.
Look out!
- Tell me I'm not seeing things.
- No. It's the Triangle.
Looks pretty nasty.
Hit the deck!
Do it, wizard. Open the gateway.
Come on, come on. Do it!
You little fool! Open the chamber!
ELGAR: Don't move, you little hair ball!
You may be willing to sacrifice yourself, runt.
But how much do you love your little family?
- Elgar! Grab the baby!
- Right! Come here, you little brat.
Well? What will it be?
That's better. Yeah.
Open the gateway!
Get to it.
- We need something to pry it with!
- Get the pipe.
Good idea.
This should do it.
- OK. Any time, Jason.
- I'm trying!
OK. This water's getting too high for me.
- We go swimming?
- Would you guys be quiet?!
I'm trying to get us out of here!
We're sinking. We're sinking.
OK, OK, don't panic. Don't panic.
We're sinking!
Oh, we're sinking. Gotta go!
- For some reason, we're taking on water.
- Water? Water?!
Water!
We're close to the gatway.
We need the keys.
- You guys go below. I'll get the keys.
- Be careful.
OK. Ready?
Now!
My key! I dropped my key!
My key!
- I can't reach it!
- Hurry, Justin!
I got it! Yes!
Come on! Hurry!
Let's do it.
We gotta get Bulk and Skull first. OK?
You guys? You have to exhale slowly on your way to the top.
Swim now, like a little guppy.
What?! It's coming from the bilge!
Activate the emergency hatch!
- Right.
- Now!
- Quicker!
- OK.
Hope that drain's not clogged.
Now open the hatch to the bilge. Hurry up!
Well, I suppose Maligore will have to do with just one sacrifice.
Man.
Wow. Land ahoy.
Thar she blows! Land ahoy!
Shiver me timbers!
I always wanted to say that.
There it is. The lost island of Muiranthias.
Yep, looks pretty lost to me.
Maligore's volcano is inside the serpant's temple. That's gotta be where they're going.
Then that's where we're goin' too.
Your evergrown hamster ain't lookin' so hot.
No! He must live long enough to open Maligore's sacred temple door.
Now what?
This is impossible! Our radar is detecting five human life forms approaching the island!
I knew they wouldn't let me down, Divatox.
- I have to get rid of those Power Rangers!
- Yeah, they're gettin' on my nerves.
Hi, Rita. D here.
Sorry to wake you.
I forgot about the time change.
Now listen. I know you've had some experience in this matter.
I need your advice.
How do I get rid of the Power Rangers?
The Power Rangers? ( laughs )
If I knew that, do you think
I'd be lying here listening to this?
My advice to you, Divatox?
Run!
Thanks for nothing.
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Let go of me! Stop it!
- She should have better camoutlage.
- What should we do?
We could resuce her.
Or we could enjoy is beach.
Guys, something's wrong.
I can't get a lock on Lerigot.
Desert Thunder's up first. I'll drive to the top of that cliff and see if I can see the temple.
Good. Keep in contact.
We'll get the other vehicles rolling.
Be careful.
Uh-oh.
Hey!
DIVATOX: They've gotta be riding something!
A couple of torpedoes will find out what.
Two torpedoes are armed and ready.
Fire one and two!
Cool view.
- Our cover's blown. Something's coming.
- And it's coming fast.
We can't be detected in the Turbo vehicles.
Come on! We gotta get our butts in those cars!
Hey, guys!
No...
Whatever it was, we hit it!
- Looks like we all got through.
- All right!
- So what do you think, Justin?
- Wow! Can we do that again?
Head for shore.
Yeah!
Come on! I haven't got all day!
Oh, man.
- Where is it? My feet hurt.
- Stop complaining. We're almost there.
Wimp.
- Move it, prisoner.
- ( drumming )
I don't like the sound of that.
Come to think of it,
I don't like the looks of it either.
Hey, the little Power Geek's back.
- So, you want a fight, huh?
- No, no, no. Wait, wait!
Those are the Malachians, guardians of Maligore. Get the wizard. Bring him.
OK. Release the wizard!
Would you hurry up?
Here.
Do it, wizard. Spin your magic.
Lerigot...
Move it, fur ball.
- The little guy packs a punch!
- Give me that!
What a rush! That's right, bow to me, you little peons.
I love being queen. All right, come on, everybody. We've got a wedding to get to.
Here comes the bride!
Watch it, shorty.
Get going. Come on!
Warriors, bring the others.
Move it.
What are you lookin' at? Get inside!
- Guys! We gotta hurry!
- Are you all right?
Lerigot's dying.
We may already be too late.
All right. We'll leave the vehicles, go for a silent approach.
Take out your morphers.
It's time to kick into action. Shift into Turbo!
Yeah! Oops.
Mountain Blaster Turbo power!
Desert Thunder Turbo power!
Dune Star Turbo power!
Wind Chaser Turbo power!
Red Lightning Turbo power!
- Let's do it!
- Right!
- Right!
- Whoa! All right!
Hey, wait for me!
I like it.
I love it, I love it.
Oh, the steaming skulls - perfect!
Put her down over there.
Come on!
Don't move.
Lerigot... Lerigot...
The lava will have to go, but we'll do all our entertaining here.
Of course, you won't be around to see it.
All right! It's time to feed my future husband!
Prepare the humans first!
On your feet!
He can have the Liarians for dessert.
If anyone knows a reason why we two should not be joined in holy matrimony, shut up!
- Sure beats walking.
- You can say that again.
Hear that? We're close. Keep your eyes open.
- Tommy! Over here!
- What's wrong?
- You OK?
- The sound's coming from that way.
- Good job, Justin.
- This is fun! Follow me, I'll lead the way.
- Justin, wait! It's too dangerous!
- I found the entrance!
( chanting ) Maligore! Maligore!
Maligore, great flame of destruction, it is I, Divatox, your one and only true soul mate.
This moment has been long in coming, and now I bring you two perfect specimens to seal our matrimonial pact.
Awake and feed upon their purity.
Come forth and let evil twist their souls!
Be free again and join forces with me!
( chanting ) Maligore! Maligore!
- All right, guys, this is it. You guys ready?
- Ready.
Move out on my command.
Go!
Hey, did we miss the party?
Who invited you?
We did. Rangers, this is Divatox.
Divatox, this is your worst nightmare.
Hah!
Lower them into the volcano.
I'll get the wheel!
Divatox! Give up?
Elgar, go and give Power Boy my answer!
Come back, you little twerp!
What's the matter? All choked up?
Come on, Lerigot. Over here.
Wait here. I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Kim!
- Into the fire!
- You guys!
- Get... outta... my... way!
- No! Let me go!
- Help! You guys!
Too late, Rangers. Even now they are becoming his spawns of evil.
I love it when a plan comes together!
Kimberly! Jason!
That's a nice trick.
Maligore's children! Destroy those who would threaten the flames of unity!
Kim!
Stop!
Leave him alone!
Kim!
Snap out of... urgh!
Let... go... of... me...
- Kim, you've gotta fight the evil.
- Evil is like evil does.
Don't do this!
No!
Leave her alone. Kimberly, no!
No.
Look at me, Kim. Look at me.
It's me.
- It's me. Tommy.
- Yes. We're your friends.
Friends?
I don't have any friends.
Wait.
Oh, yeah. And, sweetie, pink is out.
- You're mine, Ranger!
- No. I don't wanna hurt you.
Into the fire. Into the fire.
Do it. Do it. Maligore's power will exceed!
Throw him in the fire!
No! This one is mine!
- Throw him in the fire! Throw him in the fire!
- Yes. Into the fire.
Now I'm the one with the muscles and the power!
Yeah, that's right, Jase.
But you're not using your brain power!
- Come on!
- Tommy! Hang on!
Come on, Jason. Don't fight me.
You gotta remember.
Remember all the good!
- No!
- You got it. Come on.
No!
- All right, Kim?
- I'm with you!
- I think you're gonna need this.
- Yeah. Thanks.
Back to action!
- I'll get the Liarians.
- Right. Let's finish up, guys.
- Watch it, you Christmas tree ornament!
- Sorry about that.
Maligore! Arise and meet your bride!
Together we will exact revenge on Lerigot, descendant of those who imprisoned you!
Come to me! Please! Aw, come on.
- The humans are turning pure again!
- No!
- Now we don't have a sacrifice!
- Oh, but we do, dear nephew.
We do?
Bye.
Remind me to get another pet.
Out of my face.
Excuse me.
- Why, thank you.
- Any time.
Man! Tough room.
Straighten up! He's coming.
I don't think I like this one bit.
Come to me, Maligore!
Unite our powers as one!
Get ready to take this freak.
He's back!
She wants to marry him?
Are you sure about this?
- I think it's time to break out the hardware.
- Good call, Justin. Let's do it!
- Turbo lightning sword!
- Turbo hand blasters!
Turbo star chargers!
Talk to him.
- Turbo thunder cannon!
- Turbo wind fire!
You look... great. Haven't changed a bit.
Fire!
It's not working!
Whoa! What a hot-head!
What's the plan, Tommy?
That barely fazed him.
Lure brimstone-breath outside and call our Zords.
- All right! I was hoping you'd say that!
- Let's do it!
Adam! Get up!
Oh, man! I can't move!
- Come on! You can do it!
- Hey, your bride's leaving.
I think I hear my mother calling.
- Made you look.
- You have no sense of direction!
And you're ugly.
Everyone! Out the way we came!
Adam, can you make it?
- Yeah.
- OK, let's go! Move it!
You OK?
We gotta get outta here. The place is gonna blow. Come on! Move! Come on!
- Be careful!
- Come on, come on. Here we go.
- Head for the clearing.
- Got it.
- Right behind you.
- Copt that.
Yahoo!
You're goin' on a diet the minute we get back.
Come on! We'll miss the whole fight.
Let's see what this baby's got.
Ready to bring 'em together?
- Wind Chaser ready.
- Ready.
- Ready!
- Ready!
Do it! Turbo Megazord morph sequence on line.
Powering up the Turbo shield armour.
Desert Thunder's ready to rock!
- Dune Star's right there with you.
- This is awesome! Mountain Blaster ready.
# Mighty engines roar #
# Turbocharged for more... #
Initiate docking sequence now!
# Go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
Mountain Blaster's lined up and coming in!
Red Lightning coming in for final docking sequence.
# Go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo! #
Megazord turbocharge!
- Ready!
- Let's take care of business.
Let's get him!
Whoa! That was close.
Maligore! Win this one for me, babe!
We got him!
- Ready to fly?
- Ready.
All right. Engage mega Turbo jets now!
Turbo jets full power!
Later, flame-face!
- Good job!
- We did it!
Yes! Yes!
The volcano! It's erupting!
We'd better get out of here.
All my plans!
The money! The jewels! The plastic surgery...
I didn't even get a honeymoon!
You mark my words, Rygog.
The Power Rangers will pay for this one day.
- I never accept defeat!
- Right. No defeat. So what do we do now?
- Run!
- Right.
I want my mommy! Move it!
Hey, guys. How about a lift?
All right. Here we go.
PA: The competition is fierce, as
Angel Grove and Stone Canyon battle it out for the championship and the $25,000 grand prize for their charity.
And Angel Grove scores the first point.
Hey, Coach.
Come on, Adam! Get up!
Angel Grove scores again. One more point and they clinch the championship!
Point!
I'm sorry.
After seven minutes and ten seconds into the competition, the National Championship title goes to the Angel Grove shelter!
- I knew they could do it!
- Come on.
- Way to go, you guys!
- Yeah!
That was so awesome! Way to go, you guys!
Well, looks like the shelter's not closing any time soon.
Come on, Justin.
Yes! All right!

Another one coming down.
Hang on.
THE MASK
I got those... concert tickets you wanted.
You're kidding!
For Friday night?
Stanley, this is great.
What time do I pick you up?
Here's the thing.
My best girlfriend is here and she'd die to go to this... so could we get an extra ticket for her?
They're sold out. That means there's no more.
I can't let her sit home all alone.
I'll tell you what.
Go with your friend.
I couldn't do that.
No, come on.
Stanley, you are the nicest guy.
Really, you are.
- Isn't he the nicest guy?
- The best.
That was the most sickening display
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree.
I'm wearing her down.
Buddy, you need a little change of pace.
Tonight, I'll take you on a love safari.
Deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle.
Tell me more, bwana.
The Coco Bongo Club.
Hottest new joint in town.
Only the crÃªme de la crÃªme need apply.
- How do we get in?
- Are you kidding?
Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy.
This will be the perfect... night on the town.
Hold the phone.
Killer at three o'clock.
Stand back and observe.
Where do I open an account?
New accounts,right here.
You're lucky, I was on my way out--
Hold this for me, please?
I'll hold anything you want.
Can you help me?
So... what kind of account do you want?
Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that.
That's an interesting tie, Mister...
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss.
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.
Pleasure's all mine.
May l?
What?
I'm such a mess.
Oh, of course.
That's what they're there for.
As I was saying, that tie... reminds me of those, what do you call it, ink blot tests.
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.
It sort of looks like... a young woman riding bareback.
Sort of...
Lady Godiva or something.
Of course.
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?
I don't know.
Bright colors...
It's a power tie.
Supposed to make you feel... powerful.
Does it work?
Now, how about that account?
We have... several different plans.
Savings.
Checking.
Savings and checking.
Savings and CD's.
Checking and CD's.
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills.
Or we can throw your money in a big mattress.
Now, I have some forms for you to fill out.
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right.
Keep it down back there.
We'll try.
- What do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But... the motion detectors are a pain.
But you can pull this off, right?
You talking to the Doctor.
I do have one question.
Which is?
What's Niko have to say about this?
Nothing.
- This isn't his grift.
- Get real, man.
Everything is his grift.
He owns you, he owns this club, he owns this whole stinking town.
Things change.
You mess with Niko, you end up taking a dirt nap.
He's the only one who's napping... and I'm about to give him a serious wake-up call.
But we need cash... so first we take the bank... then we take Niko... and then, my friend, school is out.
And this whole city is our playground.
Bub, watch where you're going!
Hang on, hang on!
Don't get your panties in a twist.
What the hell is it?
I don't know... about seven hundred bucks, eh?
Now, what can I do for you, bub?
I'm here for the Civic.
The brake drums are shot and you need a new transmission.
What?!
All I wanted was an oil change.
Lucky we caught these problems before they caused serious trouble.
Sign right here, and press down hard.
- There's no price.
- There will be.
I've no car.
I need a car tonight.
Bring around the loaner.
The loaner?
The loaner?
It's a classic.
Gals, meet my buddy Stanley Ipkiss.
Humungo in the banking business.
- Not really.
- Let's get in this joint.
How you doing, buddy?
- It's Charlie!
- How you doing?
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see.
Good to see you.
Come on, gals.
See you on the inside.
This is a mistake.
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.
- My friends are inside.
- Lose him.
This isn't fair.
Watch it, I'm a bleeder.
Put me down now, or I am never coming back here.
Jeez.
Mr. Ipkiss!
Hi.
Are you okay?
Me?
I'm great..
Really good.
I never felt better, really.
I'm just... catching some air.
Your car, sir.
That's not my car.
It matches the ticket.
Alright...
I'll take it.
But I am very angry!
Believe this?
You drive in in a Porsche...
Hey, Mister!
Hold on!
I know CPR!
Hey, you!
What are you doing down there?
I'm just looking for... my mask!
I got it.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
Actually, no.
My new carpet!
Well ,this is coming right out of your security deposit.
You know...
What?
Nothing.
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss, a big nothing.
Aren't you due at the lab to get your bolts tightened?
I should have said that.
Hey, you.
Milo!
No jumping up allowed.
It's against doggie ordinance.
What do you want?
You want me to throw that?
I'm very tired.
I'll throw it one time.
I won't throw it with you attached to it.
You ready?
Get it.
Ipkiss!
Turn down those cartoons!
Alright, Mrs. Peenman!
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody wears a mask?
That's correct.
We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking.
We suppress the id, our darkest desires... and adopt a more socially acceptable image.
The book is "The Masks We Wear" by Dr. Arthur Neuman.
Thank you for being here.
What's the matter with you?
What is it?
What are you looking for?
You like this thing? You like it?
"The Masks We Wear".
"That's correct.
We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking".
Yeah, right.
Smoking!
It's party time.
P-A-R-T-Y
Why? Because I gotta.
MANAGER
QUIET PLEASE
Snooze!
Look, ma, I'm road kill!
- Get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate. squeeze me gently
Hey, mister... you got the time?
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!
Look at that!
Time to honk your nose and pull your underwear over your head.
Come on!
Step right up here, don't be shy!
Nobody likes... a bashful leather head.
Move it!
For my first trick...
I'll do something for you, son.
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.
Now...
Sorry, wrong pocket.
For you... a little body English.
A French poodle.
The dog was rabid, had to put it down.
At last but not least, my favorite.
A Tommy gun.
This is incredible.
With these powers I could be... a superhero.
I'd fight crime, protect the innocent... work for world peace.
But first...
RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING
Hold onto your lug nuts... it's time for an overhaul.
It was a dream.
It was a dream.
I must lay off the cartoons.
Lt. Kellaway. You know anything about the disturbance last night?
Disturbance?
Some prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman.
Attacked?
You didn't hear anything?
She unloaded a couple of rounds of buckshot 5 feet from here.
Look at the floor.
He put that right in my floor, then he jumped out... the window. Officer, are you writing notes?
This is... impossible.
Those pyjamas are impossible.
This happened.
See, I have... an inner ear problem.
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- Is that so?
Here's my card. If you recall anything unusual about last night... anything at all, call me.
You bet. Thank you.
And good luck... cracking the case.
Oh, my God, I'm late!
Keys, keys...
Where's the keys?
Damn.
Get the keys.
Find them.
Get the keys.
I am so late.
Good boy.
Come on, Milo. Give them to me.
Drop it.
I want a proctologist standing by.
The best one you can find.
Can you tell me what happened?
- No, you can quote me.
- Looks like some Mob tactic.
She broke the case. Come on, get these rubbernecks out of here.
Where were you last night?
We looked all over for you.
Did you happen to look outside, in the gutter?
Did you check the paper?
Your girlfriend got a great review.
Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo
You're 50 minutes late.
That's like stealing.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never happen again. I've been a jerk.
If you weren't busy oogling girlie pictures... you might get some work done.
Sir. She's a perspective client of Stanley's.
Really?
The next time she comes in... send her to my office.
You bet.
Gee, I wish "my" daddy owned a bank.
Then I could be a rich little creep too.
You think she'll ever come back?
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.
Girls like her always look for the BBD: Bigger Better Deal.
You don't know that.
She's an artist. She's...
- sensitive.
- Forget her.
She'll rip out your heart, put it in a blender and hit "frappe".
You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth.
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with... red hair... full, pouting lips... a white blouse, green jacket... and a name tag.
You really narrowed it down.
Too bad she's already taken.
Hello there, may I be of assistance?
Stanley Ipkiss?
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt from the Tribune.
I canceled my subscription because they kept stealing--
No, actually, I want to ask you a few questions.
Really? About what?
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?
Me?
I don't even have a car.
You know, 'cause they pollute.
You don't own an '89 Civic?
Oh, that car, yeah.
It's coming back to me.
Miss... What was your name?
Peggy Brandt.
Wait a minute.
Peggy Brandt?
Of "Ask Peggy"?
That's right.
You printed one of my letters last year.
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."
You're Mister Nice Guy?
Do you realize how much mail we got about that letter?
100's of women are looking for a guy like you.
Really?
You know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town?
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.
Why are you covering this story?
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.
I'm looking to become a real reporter.
When you were at Ripley Auto did you see anything suspicious?
Anything?
I won't make trouble for you.
I just want the truth.
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do.
If you think of anything... this is my number.
This is my... you know, personal number.
100's of women are looking for a guy like me?
Sure.
I'm one of them.
120 yards.
Hello, Dorian.
Thanks for dropping by.
Next time, call.
Leave the delivery boys at home.
The cops... tried to shut the club down this morning.
They say you've been using the place to run your own small-time scams.
When I hear things like that...
I start losing my concentration.
My game... it goes straight to hell.
You could too.
205 yards.
I'm fed up with you... but....
I'll cut you a break.
One week to get out of town.
After that...
I'll use your empty little skull to break in my new nine iron.
Are you okay?
Your car, sir.
I am now.
Tina, come on.
You can't.
You can't.
Go on.
I don't believe it.
Stupid.
She would never...
No way!
Hold on, Sugar.
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.
Somebody,stop me.
Can't make the scene if you don't have the green.
I better make a little stop.
EDGE CITY POWER
"SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR"
How's it going, Freeze?
It's looking good here.
You're on your own. I must go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.
Do it.
The doctor is about to operate.
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.
Cops!
Not on the list, not in the club.
How do?
You on the list?
No, but I believe my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?
Franklin, Grant... and Jackson.
That's it! No one gets in.
Now we present the most beautiful flower of the Congo Bongo...
Miss Tina Carlyle.
Beautiful.
Love makes me treat you...
The way that I do
Gee, baby... ain't I good to you
There's nothing too good... for a boy that's so true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
A diamond ring... a Cadillac car...
And everything
Love makes me treat you... the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
Love makes me treat you... the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing too good... for a man so true
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you
I know how to make a man happy
I'll treat you right
- Why are you here?
- There's trouble.
You better come upstairs.
Come on, let's go.
They got me paying taxes... for what I gave to you
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
Let's rock this joint.
Smoking.
What happened?
Someone hit the joint before us.
Get that, Doc.
Suck on that.
Son of a bitch!
Who did this, man?
Who?!
Him!
That's the guy.
The guy dancing with Tina?
He's dead meat.
Come on.
I want this place cleared now.
Club's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!
Party's over, let's go!
Get out of here.
Get lost!
Okay, Twinkle Toes.
Where is my money, tell me now.
You've got 17.5 %  in T-bills amortized over the fiscal year.
8 %  in stocks and bonds.
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...
Fortunately, funeral bouquets are deductible.
Ice this deadbeat.
Shoot him!
Thanks.
You got me, partner.
Hold me close,Red.
It's getting dark.
Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home this Christmas.
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.
Pardon me.
Thank you.
You love me.
You really love me.
You're not going anywhere.
Drop it, Tyrel!
Drop it.
You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?
What I got is probable cause.
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.
Easy. You're giving me a woody.
And one was wearing a big, green mask.
For once, you're right.
Except it wasn't one of my boys.
Maybe if you tried a little actual police work...
Cuff him.
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist.
Call that high-priced lawyer of yours.
We'll go downtown for a chat.
Get him out of here.
I know you're in there.
Police!
Open up!
Oh, my God.
I know you're in there!
Open up!
Come on, I'm getting blisters on my fingers.
Stop it.
I'm coming, okay.
I'll be right there.
Let's go, move it!
Alright!
Hi, Lieutenant.
This isn't the best time right now.
I just--
Won't you come in?
Where were you last night?
Here, mostly.
Something wrong?
What do you know about The Mask?
"Mask?"
Don't insult my intelligence.
He robs the bank you work in, then I find this in the Coco Bongo.
There can't be 2 idiots with these pajamas.
May I see those pajamas?
Those pajamas?
Those pajamas... were stolen.
Somebody stole your pajamas?
What is this city coming to... when a man's pajama drawer is no longer safe!
Look at that guy.
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'll say.
That's one hell of a rubber mask.
Lab reports?
We got fingerprints from currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men.
He beat them to the punch.
Get the bank employee files and run down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.
You figure it was an inside job?
I need some prints to lock this whack job up till doomsday.
50 grand... to whoever finds that green bastard before the cops.
I want you to get the word out to every street hustler... every low life in this town.
Understand?
I want him here tomorrow, alive.
You still here?
Come on, let's go.
What are you looking at?
You.
You're losing it.
I'm not losing anything... except maybe some extra baggage.
What's that mean?
You didn't fight much last night when that freak kissed you.
Did it look like I had much of a choice?
Maybe you did... maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?
I'll tell you one thing.
It's going to be payback for anybody who crosses me.
We have a crisis here and you stroll in an hour late?
If I must put up with--
Back off, monkey boy... or I'll tell your dad you treat this place like your piggy bank.
Or we should call the IRS... and arrange a vacation for you at Club Fed?
That'll be all.
Genius.
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.
God! What side of whose bed did you wake up on, man?
I'm not sure.
I haven't exactly been myself lately.
You don't look real fabulous.
Really, do I look bad?
Don't worry. This'll put the color back in your cheeks.
2 tickets to the charity ball at the Coco Bongo Club, Saturday.
Anybody who's anybody will be there.
Want to be my date?
Wait just a minute.
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to thank you.
I don't have much to open an account with anymore.
What about the club?
You were doing great.
It's not your problem.
I'll be okay.
Come here.
You didn't stop by just to see me, did you?
It's okay, tell me.
The guy they say robbed this place...
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the club.
Really?
They say he's pretty... weird looking.
Yeah, but... you should see him dance.
Did anyone find out who he is?
Why, you interested?
Just curious, I guess.
I better be going.
Thanks for everything.
You'd like to see him again?
I wouldn't mind.
I know him, you know.
You do?
We're old college buddies, him and me.
It's funny you mention he dances because...
I taught him a couple of dance moves myself.
Think you could have him meet me tonight?
Maybe I could work something out.
- How about at Landfill Park?
- Sunset.
- Perfect.
- Super.
Thanks, Stanley.
You really are a nice guy.
This is an interesting place.
Looks like fourth- or fifth-century Scandinavian.
Possibly a representation of one of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.
Loki?
Who is Loki?
The Norse god of mischief.
Supposedly he caused such trouble that
Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.
Then he could have banished him into that mask.
I'm talking about mythology,
Mr. Ipkiss.
This is a piece of wood. but your book...!
My book is about masks as a metaphor.
A metaphor,not to be taken literally.
You suffer from a mild delusion.
Alright.
I'll prove it to you.
But I am not responsible for the consequences.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert.
You don't scare me.
Go right ahead.
See you.
You said Loki was a night god.
Maybe it works at night.
I should warn you that I don't work personally with really sick people.
There are private institutions for those things.
I can arrange for a safe environment for you tonight, if you want.
I must see Tina.
But what can I do?
Do I go as myself... or The Mask?
If I tell you, you promise to leave my office right now?
Go as yourself... and as The Mask.
Because they are both one and the same beautiful person.
Got the cross-check on the fingerprints. It's Ipkiss.
I'm looking at him.
Keep the SWAT team standing by.
If he's half as bad as they say, we'll have a full dance card.
Pickle relish?
- Get in the car.
- But I ordered onion rings.
LANDFILL PARK
What are you doing here?
I wanted to make sure that you
2 got together all right.
That's nice.
I hardly ever stop by here.
It's hard to believe it was... a garbage heap.
It's really beautiful right around sunset.
The methane emissions really pick up the colors.
All those... pinks and greens.
My friend will be along here any minute. I better go.
Stanley, wait.
Hello, cherie.
We meet again!
Is it fate?
Is it meant to be?
It is written in the stars... that we are destined to fraternize?
I'd like to think so.
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal my croissant.
I will spread your p t . I will dip my ladle in your vichyssoise.
She's so coy.
I love it.
Our love is like a red, red rose.
And I am a little thorny.
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!
Shoot the window. I don't care!
This is Kellaway.
I need back-up.
Cigarette?
Now, like Napoleon...
I will divide and conquer.
Police!
Merde.
Freeze.
Put your hands up.
But you told me to freeze.
Alright, alright, unfreeze.
You're under arrest.
It wasn't me.
It was the one-armed man.
Alright, I confess.
I did it, you hear?
And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!
What are they going to do to me, Sarge?
What are they going to do?
Sorry, son, that's not my department.
Search him.
Where's a camcorder when you need one?
It's going to be a long night.
My wife'll kill me.
- What is it?
- Cops got Ipkiss at Landfill Park.
Let me cover it. I need this story.
You go home to Claire.
I don't know. Ramsey said--
I will take care of Ramsey.
Thanks a million, I owe you one.
Really big sunglasses, nerf ball...
Bike horn...
Small-mouthed bass... bowling pin... mouse-trap... rubber chicken...
- Little to the left. That's it.
- I don't know.
Funny eyeball glasses...
I've never seen those in my life.
- bazooka.
- I have a permit for that.
- Picture of Kellaway's wife...
- What?
CALL ME LOVER!
Margaret! Son of a bitch!
I figured you had a sense of humor. you married her!
That's got to hurt.
Get him!
It's over. Raise your hands... or we'll fire.
Hit it!
They call me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rumba beat
When I play the maracas
I go chick-chicky boom
Yes, I'm Cuban Pete
I'm the craze of my street
When I start to dance everything goes
Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom
The senoritas sing... and they swing
It's very nice
Full of spice
They dance and bring a happy ring
Never a care
Singing a song
All the day long
If you like the beat
Take a lesson from Cuban Pete
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom
He's a modest guy
Although he's the hottest guy
In Havana
Si, senorita, I know... that when I chicky boom
It's very nice so full of spice
I place my hand on your hip
And if you will give me your hand
Then we shall try
Just you and I
- Not bad.
- Shut up and help me down.
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom
Chick-chicky boom
Dance and I'll blow your brains out.
Give me that thing.
See you!
There! Let's get him.
Snap out of it. This dance is over!
Let's go! Follow me, officers!
He's down the alley. Follow me.
Come on. Grab your gun.
Stanley, get in!
There!
Halt, or I'll shoot!
Shoot! Shoot!
Seat belts.
I missed him.
Come on, we all missed him.
THE MASK ROBS BANK
I saw it.
I saw everything.
What's happening to you, Stanley?
It's crazy.
I'm losing control.
When I put that mask on...
I can do anything.
Be anything.
It's wrecking my life.
My life is wrecked. Wrecked.
I don't know what's happening to you... but I do know this: that letter you sent my column... that was from a guy with more guts... and more heart... than any of the creeps
I've met in this city.
Whatever that mask is... you don't need it.
You...
Stanley Ipkiss... are already all you'll ever need to be.
Gosh, Peg... do you really mean that?
Actually... no.
What?
Where were you? I've been vamping for 20 minutes.
Is this him?
You got the 50 thou'?
Give her the money.
Right.
With the mask on, he turns into that green thing.
What are you doing?
Sorry. You really are a great guy,
I just can't lose my condo.
It's so hard to find an apartment in this city.
You said you wouldn't hurt him!
I lied.
Tell me.
How's this mask work?
I don't know. You just... put it on.
Boss... be careful, huh?
What a rush.
You okay?
I'm better than ever, you idiot.
What do we do with Ipkiss?
The police want the mask.
We'll give them The Mask.
The money better be here... or you can lp-kiss your ass good-bye.
Get over there.
Can't believe it. Hardened cops dancing in the street... and broadcast on the 11 o'clock news.
- The SWAT team was offered Vegas.
- I'm history.
The Captain'll have my badge for breakfast with a pension on top.
It's not all your fault.
Something will turn up.
Sure, Ipkiss will fall right into my lap.
Get him off of me!
Wait!
I can explain everything.
You can explain everything?
Explain this!
Get him up! Let's go!
I got a cell for you, pal.
Forget about me, buddy.
Find a new place to live.
I'll be in here for a long, long time.
You, with the face.
You got a visitor.
- Why?
- Is it true?
You're The Mask.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
If I get... a good lawyer and a deal...
I'll be out in about 10,000 years.
It's risky, coming here.
Your boyfriend might be upset.
He'll be at the charity ball tonight.
Like what? The Lambada?
This is serious. There must be a way to stop him.
How does it work?
I don't know.
It's like... it brings your innermost desires to life.
If deep down inside... you're a bit repressed and hopelessly romantic... you become some sort of... a love-crazy wild man.
And if you're like Dorian?
Then we're all in big trouble.
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast.
Thanks.
For what?
Lots of things.
Sharing a sunset with me.
For being the only guy who treated me like a person, not... a party favor.
For being any kind of romantic... even a hopeless one.
You're welcome.
That night at the club I knew...
I'd found someone special.
The Mask.
It was the guy inside The Mask.
It was you all along.
Lady, time's up.
Could I have just... one more minute?
I've got to disappear for a while now.
Don't know where but I'll let you know as soon as I can.
Somebody help me!
Guard, guard!
A woman's being chased in the alley.
She needs help.
Sure. Keep it down.
Serve and protect, man!
Good boy. Come on.
Jump up. Can you jump up?
Remember how I taught you not to jump up on people? Forget that.
Come on! Get up here.
Get up. Get up here!
Get up. Get up here. That's it.
You can do it.
Come on. Come on!
Put some effort into it!
Baby, there you are.
I was worried about you.
- You talk to the cops?
- Only to see what Ipkiss told them.
That's right, you and Stanley.
You two are getting awfully close.
Bet you helped him with the bank job.
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?
Look what I found in her car.
Going away alone, baby?
Boys, I want you to... get her something pretty to wear.
We're going to a party tonight.
We'll have one hell of a time, right?
Get out of my sight.
Jump up.
Get up. Come on.
Come on, Milo. Jump, please.
Do it for Daddy.
That's it!
God, I can't believe it.
Good boy. Good boy.
See that man over there?
He's got keys.
Go get those keys.
Go get them. Go get the keys.
That's it.
The key.
No, not the cheese, the keys.
Drop the cheese... and get the keys.
Over there, over there.
Oh, man. Come on.
Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy.
Give it, give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
Come on, drop it, drop it.
It's sundown.
It's almost time.
I wouldn't, darling.
DANGER
EXPLOSIVES
Wouldn't want to start the celebration early.
Hold it!
I am warning you...
I am seriously stressed out here.
Easy.
Come on.
Don't be an idiot.
You're in a police station. There is no way you'll walk out of here like this.
You're know, you're right.
- Absolutely right.
- What are you doing?
You'll take me out... as your prisoner.
Put it on! Put it on!
Come on.
- I'm really very sorry about this.
- I'm sure.
You got the wrong guy.
It's a bum rap.
I got my rights.
Where are you taking Ipkiss?
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay.
I get it. Pig Latin, right?
Eesay ouyay aterlay.
Come on!
Sit back and relax.
I must change for the party.
TONIGHT, CASINO
WAR ORPHANS FUND
I need cigarettes.
- Which brand?
- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke.
But for you, I would shoot the Surgeon General.
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word?
I always have time for the press and my loyal constituents.
Let me out of these cuffs, you drive like a maniac.
Sorry, we're late for the ball.
Alice and the rabbit'll be disappointed.
Now you're being cynical.
Who are you?
I'm just an ex-employee... who's come for his back pay.
Or should I say payback?
Kill him.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I will be the host... for the rest of the evening.
Get your dog away from me.
Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.
Where's everyone?
Something's not kosher.
- Exactly.
- Watch it!
Sorry.
I must lock you in.
Use the radio.
You know, call for back-up or something.
This could be dangerous.
Stay here and be a good boy.
Daddy has to go kick some ass.
He's a dead man.
Down! Get down!
Take it easy, I got the point.
Blow it!
Bastard.
What's the matter, darling?
This is your big production number.
And you know it's important... to go out with a big bang.
Why are you here?
Take this gun and start sneaking people out the back.
Step back.
- Do you know who I am?
- A dead man if you don't step back.
What about some respect?
- What kind of thug are you?
- All set, Dorian.
That's it.
This party's over... in 10 minutes.
This is the moment when a man... shows what he's really made of.
Crap.
Drop it.
Smart dog.
Boss, look who decided to crash the party.
How's it going?
Bring him up here!
Wait! No!
This is no time for last requests.
But all I wanted was a kiss.
A kiss?
Just one...
Iast kiss.
I can't shut it off.
There's always time... for one last kiss.
From the real Dorian.
The one I used to love.
Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel.
Romeo!
This place will blow!
Just wait!
I've decided... to give her one last thrill.
Get it!
Run, Milo!
Stanley, hurry!
Don't worry.
It's all over now.
Got you.
I'll take you apart.
I hope you can enjoy the victory with one freaking eye!
Good doggie.
Good doggie.
I'm winning!
JACKPOT
Oh, my God!
This must be a new breed.
Easy, boy!
Good boy!
Did you miss me?
I guess not!
Now, you have to ask yourself one question:
"Do I feel lucky?"
Well... do you... punks?
That's a spicy meatball.
How do?
This guy's incorrigible.
You were good, kid, real good... but as long as I'm around you'll be second-best.
Police! Hands up!
Officers, arrest those men.
I've always wanted to say that.
Come on.
Give me that gun.
He stole all our jewelry.
Take me to headquarters...
Stop that man!
I've got you now.
Watch it, Chunky!
- Mayor Tilton, I'm so--
- What's wrong with you?
That man is The Mask.
No. Dorian Tyrel was The Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes.
This man here saved our lives.
- With a little help.
- You're a real hero.
It's nothing... any American with... balls of steel wouldn't do for his community.
Come on.
Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?
Leave the dog alone.
I want you in my office first thing tomorrow.
- Yes, Your Honor.
- That doesn't sound good at all.
No, it doesn't.
What would sound good to you?
- Breakfast.
- Shut up!
Sure you know what you're doing?
I'm sure.
Then do what you must.
Sure you won't miss this guy?
When he's gone, all that's left is me.
Smoking!
THE MASK
I want a car.
Chicks dig the car.
This is why Superman works alone.
Do try and bring this one back in one piece, sir!
Don't wait up, Al.
I'll cancel the pizzas.
Batman,
a new villain has commandeered
the Gotham Museum.
He's frozen
the antiquities wing.
He's turned
the security guards into ice.
He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze."
Mr. Freeze.
Stop! Drop your weapon...
...or we'll shoot!
The Iceman Cometh.
Please, show some mercy.
Mercy?!
I'm afraid that my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy.
In this universe...
...there's only one absolute.
Everything...
...freezes.
Hi, Freeze.
I'm Batman.
You're not sending me to the cooler.
Nice catch.
You break it, you buy it.
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!
Kill them! Kill them!
Destroy everything!
It's the hockey team from hell.
Get the ice...
...I'll get the Iceman.
Thanks.
Sweet.
I got mine.
Where's yours?
What killed the dinosaurs?
The Ice Age!
Hit me, boys.
Thanks for playing.
I was hoping you'd drop in.
Watch the numbers...
...for they are the harbingers of your doom.
Can you feel it coming?
The icy cold of space.
At 30,000 feet, your heart will freeze...
...and beat no more.
After you're frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Freeze, you're mad.
This capsule explodes, it'll slaughter thousands.
Freeze well.
- Who invited you?
- I was hanging around.
I thought you'd stay in the museum, round up some thugs.
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life."
A Batbomb?
We must blow this up before it turns Gotham into a crater.
Now what, call a taxi?!
Watch the first step!
Surf's up!
Gotcha!
Cowabunga!
He's freezing the furnace!
I got him.
Stay cool...
...Birdboy.
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.
Will you chase the villain...
...or save him?
Emotion makes you weak.
That's why this day is mine.
I'll kill you next time!
Did we get him?
Drats!
My experiment to mate the orchid and the rattlesnake has failed again...
...but I still have hope for the animal-plant crossbreedings.
If I can only find the right dose of venom...
...these plants will be able to fight back, like animals.
I will have given flora...
...a chance against the thoughtless ravages of man.
Personal note:
My work would proceed faster...
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk my venom samples...
...back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.
Why won't he let me in the lab?
What is he doing in there?
Ladies and gentlemen of the un-United Nations...
...and...
...our mystery bidder...
...may I present...
...Antonio Diego...
...serial murderer, serving life...
...in prison...
...and sole surviving...
...volunteer.
And what a charmer he is.
By merely drilling three concentric holes directly...
...into Antonio's cranial cavity...
I have...
...created viaducts into the most primitive part of his brain...
...the limbic system.
And now I add...
...my Super-Soldier Serum...
...code-named...
..."Venom"...
...to which I add my very own recipe of steroids...
...and toxins.
Plug him in.
Time to scream.
Genius!
Behold...
...the ideal killing machine!
I call this little number...
..."Bane."
Bane of Humanity!
Imagine it.
Your own private army made up of thousands of these super-soldiers.
Bidding begins at a mere...
...10 million!
Turbo!
Show off for Daddy.
Dr. Isley.
Welcome to my parlor.
What?
You monster!
How could you?!
Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications.
He cut the funding for our work.
Without your research...
...I couldn't have come this far.
Join me.
The two of us, entwined, side by side.
Join you?
I have spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction...
...and now you...
...corrupt my research...
...into some maniacal scheme for world domination.
When I get through...
...you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry.
Do you hear me?!
You psycho!
Well...
...I can respect your opinion.
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.
I'm afraid you'll have to die.
Let the poisons and toxins burn a grave for you...
...deep into the earth you love so much!
Bye-bye, dear!
Fellow maniacs...
...bidding...
...begins!
Gotham University Labs security video, 2 years ago.
Dr. Victor Fries...
...2- time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology.
After his wife contracted a rare disease...
...Macgregor's Syndrome...
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic sleep until he could find a cure.
Now, here's where everything goes north.
That's got to hurt.
That liquid is 50 below.
But, he survived somehow.
The cryo-solution mutated his body.
- What happened to his wife?
- No one knows.
She's presumed dead.
Freeze needs extreme cold to survive.
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
If it's ice the Iceman wants...
Coming, sir.
Yes, sir?
We need the Wayne diamonds.
We going to trap a snowman?
Yes, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
You were reckless and almost got killed.
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!
How we supposed to work together if you won't trust me?
How indeed?
He's overeager, he's impulsive.
I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Perhaps the truth is you really don't trust anyone.
Don't tell me you're on his side again.
Despite all your talents...
...you're still just a novice in the ways of family.
Master Dick...
...follows the same star as you...
...but gets there by his own course.
You must learn to trust him, for that is the nature of family.
I trust you, Alfred.
But I shan't be here forever.
Good night, Master Bruce.
Good night, Alfred.
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.
Good gracious, what a tumble.
There's a brave boy.
Yes, sir.
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness.
We're making the final modifications on Bane right now.
We'll have a flawless super-soldier out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.
Dr. Isley?
Pamela?
You look great.
Especially for a dead woman.
Hello, Jason.
I think I've had a change of heart.
Or quite...
...literally...
...the animal-plant toxins had a rather unique effect on me.
They replaced my blood with aloe...
...my skin with chlorophyll...
...and filled...
...my lips...
...with venom.
And, Jason, one other thing.
I probably should have mentioned this earlier...
...I'm...
...poison.
It's a jungle in here.
I am Nature's arm...
...her spirit...
...her will!
Hell, I am Mother Nature.
And the time has come...
...for plants to take back...
...the world so rightfully ours...
...because it's not nice...
...to fool with Mother Nature.
"Wayne Enterprises."
Coming, Bane, darling.
We've got a plane to catch.
I'm Mr. Icicle
I'm Mr. Ten Below
Sing! Sing!
Come on, sing!
Louder! Come on!
Sing! Sing! Sing!
He's Mr. White Christmas
Louder!
He's Mr. Icicle
Freezy...
...I'm feeling hot.
I find that unlikely.
So my hair is brittle and my skin is dry...
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.
Let's heat things up.
My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Talk about your cold shoulder.
Frosty!
Yeah, boss?
Energy.
Battling the Bat exhausted my power.
But...
...I was successful nevertheless.
Absolutely, boss.
One more giant diamond of this size...
...and my freezing engine will be complete.
I will freeze the city.
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.
Unless the city bows to my demands...
...it's winter forever in Gotham.
The city fathers will have no choice...
...but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...
...so I can find a cure.
Leave us.
Sure, boss.
We need quality time.
Soon we will be together once more.
Soon.
I'll get it.
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.
No apology necessary.
It's the first time it's happened in thirty years.
Please be looking for me.
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.
Uncle Alfred!
My dear.
Oh, my dear...
...what a most wonderful surprise.
How did you manage to come here all the way from England?
My dear, you are so kind to your old uncle.
Uncle?
Barbara is the daughter of my dear sister Margaret.
Both my parents were killed in a car accident 5 years ago.
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me ever since.
- You have?
- Secrets, Al?
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house.
Don't you think, sir?
I'm on break from...
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.
The new computer sciences division.
- How'd you know?
- Says so on the patch on your sweater.
- What is it? It's beautiful.
- You can say that again.
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.
I'll show you how to ride it.
You certainly will not!
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, I don't know.
All this luxury really isn't my style, but...
...yeah, I'd love to.
Then it's settled.
But, sir, we...
...we do get so busy here.
Don't be silly.
After all, she's family.
Uncle Alfred?
I came to tuck you in.
You came to tuck me in?
That's quite a switch.
What're you working on?
I'm trying to find my brother, your Uncle Wilfred.
He's first butler to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.
But Miranjapore is a floating court.
It travels through India.
I remember Mom getting postcards.
So Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
I don't suppose they have fax machines on elephants.
I've been trying to reach him with no success.
When one grows ancient, one yearns for family.
I have the same picture of Mom by my bed.
Peg?
My nickname for sweet Margaret.
It's good to see you again.
I've missed you.
As I have you.
Sleep well, child.
You sleep.
Go to bed.
Good morning, Gotham.
It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory...
... where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises...
... is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.
Gotham Observatory, Bane.
And step on it.
Step.
My father told me, "To succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it. "
So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...
... to Gotham 's
Observatory Restoration Project.
With any luck...
...this telescope will give future generations a chance...
...to follow their own stars.
Brucy...
...is it true that this new telescope can see around the globe?
Yes. If you'll watch these monitors right here.
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect light from anywhere on the planet.
From here, we'll be able to see the sky anywhere on Earth...
...and through this intricate network of satellites...
...reflect it back to our very own Gotham City for observation.
Just don't point it at my bedroom.
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison...
...have been going out forever.
Are you going to tie the knot?
Marriage?
Marriage?
You want to give me a hand here?
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.
And that's most certainly enough for us... for now.
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.
You're a lot of help.
Miss, you need to stop.
Move, fascist bulldog!
- You need an appointment...
- No, I don't!
Miss, you're not authorized to be up here.
She has no pass, sir.
Little overly protective, but you won't hurt me, Miss...?
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Doctor...
...what can I do for you?
Actually, I already work for you, or did.
Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...
...cease all actions that toxify our environment.
Forget the stars, look here at the earth...
...our mother, our womb.
She deserves your loyalty and protection.
And yet, you spoil her lands...
...poison her oceans...
...blacken her skies!
You're killing her!
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat...
...no coolants to preserve food, millions of people would die.
Acceptable losses in the battle to save the planet.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
Mammals!
A day of reckoning is coming.
That's right.
The same plants and flowers that saw you...
...crawl from the primordial soup...
...will reclaim this planet and there will be no one to protect you!
You must be new in town.
In Gotham City...
...Batman and Robin protect us...
...even from plants and flowers.
Maybe you'd like to meet them.
Caped crusaders are going to help us auction...
...a diamond to raise money for our botanical gardens.
Just a few mammals doing what we can for the world's plants.
Thank you all for coming.
Good day, Doctor.
Batman and Robin...
...militant arm of the warm-blooded oppressors...
...animal protectors of the status quo.
First...
...I'll rid myself of the fur and feathered pests.
And then Gotham...
...will be mine...
...for the greening.
Excuse me, chief.
I got something here you might want to see.
I hate when people talk during the movie.
One more diamond, my love.
One more.
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds."
Very nice.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...Gossip Gerty of "Good Morning Gotham" and I...
...welcome you to the gem of the evening.
Our own Commissioner Gordon...
...displaying...
...the famed Heart of Isis, on loan...
...from the collection of my close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.
Think Freeze will take the bait?
He'll be here.
...to dance with one of our fabulous flowers...
...the famed diamond draped around her neck.
Let's start the bidding!
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!
20,000 for the tiger lily!
And I bid...
...30,000 dollars for the lovely magnolia!
Boys, please...
...let's show some gusto!
Hi, there.
And you are?
Poison...
...Poison Ivy.
Why not send junior home early?
I've got some wild oats to sow.
On the other hand...
...youth does have its advantages.
Endurance, stamina.
Forget the geriatric Bat.
Come, join me.
My garden needs tending.
I'll take it from here, pal.
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?
Some lucky boy's about to hit the honey pot.
I'll include an evening of my company for the winner.
I'll bring everything you see here...
...plus everything you don't.
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!
And I'll bid...
...500,000 dollars!
One million dollars.
- 2 million.
- You don't have it. 3 million.
I'll borrow it from you. Four.
5 million.
That's a utility belt, not a money belt.
6 million.
7 million.
Never leave the cave without it.
You boys aren't going to start fighting over little old me, now are you?
All right, everyone!
Chill.
Chill.
Get the gun!
Look at you!
Let me guess.
Plant Girl?
Vine Lady?
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...
...or I'll turn you into mulch.
Pheromone dust...
...designed to heat...
...a man's blood.
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!
If you insist.
Clever little clover.
That's my exit cue.
Thanks.
Good night.
Cool party!
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes to thaw these people.
Miss Ivy, you've just met one of the most sinister men in Gotham.
That's not a man...
...that is a god.
Enough monkey business.
We've got work to do.
Monkey work.
You can't make the jump.
I can!
Pull back!
I can make it!
Redbird control codes.
Disable engine.
Don't do it to me!!
We won't make it!
It's a cold town.
I could've made that jump.
You could've splattered your brains on the building's side.
The Flying Graysons were a team.
We had to trust each to do his job.
That's what being partners is about.
Counting on someone is the way to win.
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.
That's your idea of friendship?
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.
It's Batman and Robin, not Robin and Batman.
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.
If you want to stay in this house, on this team, you'll abide by them.
This is no partnership.
You're never going to trust me!
Dear brother Wilfred...
...I have tried every address I know for you.
I'm just praying this reaches you.
We have very little time.
Batman monopolized the evening news.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Is there something wrong, sir?
Am I pig-headed?
Is it always...
...my way or the highway?
Why, yes.
Actually.
Death and chance stole your parents...
...but rather than become a victim...
...you have done everything in your power to control the fates.
For what is Batman...
...if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world?
An attempt to control...
...death itself?
But I can't, can I?
None of us can.
Sorry. So sorry!
Teach you that at Oxbridge?
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.
I suppose you had a minor in motorbikes also?
Couldn't resist.
It's just so beautiful.
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.
All right?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Good night.
Drag him into the cold beam.
Welcome home, Frost Face.
You're the common cold, and we are the cure.
Allow me to break the ice.
My name is Freeze.
Learn it well...
...for it's the chilling sound of your doom.
All right, Freezie, you can't live outside the cold zone.
Look at him stew.
Get used to it.
You're going to be here a very long...
...long time.
Sadly...
...you will not live to see it.
Batface and Birdbrain turned out to be much more resistant...
...to my love dust than expected.
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.
They'll literally be dying for me.
"Turkish baths."
This looks promising.
A fixer-upper.
But with a certain homey charm.
A minus!
Current tenants.
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.
Hello, yourself.
You look good enough to eat.
That I am.
Come and get me, if you can.
With pleasure.
Let's redecorate.
I've always hankered for something on the water.
What is this floor?
It took God seven days...
...to create Paradise.
Let's see if I can do better.
Good babies.
Grow for mommy.
Bane, darling...
...I found a fellow who strikes my fancy.
A cool customer, yes.
Icy demeanor...
...no question.
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...
...to my advantage.
Honey, clean up this mess.
We've got company coming.
Honey.
Company.
We've been going out for over a year now, and...
Okay, here it goes.
I want to spend my life with you.
I'm not the marrying kind.
There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.
You've had your wild nights.
"Wild" doesn't...
...quite cover it.
You'll make someone a good husband one day...
...but I can't wait forever.
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do...
...you'll just shut down.
I know the way you are.
Think about it.
Just promise me you'll think about it.
Okay?
You don't have to answer now.
Just...
...think it over.
Here's food for thought.
Who's Ivy?
You just called me "Ivy."
Who's Ivy?
I wish I knew.
Enhance detail, 14 to 19.
Who are you?
Gotcha!
Banker, how much coin to play?
You're the chick who won the tunnel run 2 nights ago!
That'd be me.
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.
Why don't you take your tricycle and run home?
- Want a side bet?
- How much?
- How much you got?
- How much you got?
All right, let's race! Come on!
Just make sure the guys are ready at the end of the bridge.
You got it, Spike!
Out of my way, losers!
Nice try, girlie!
You're next!
Excuse me!
Look out, baby!
Not bad, for a chick!
Now!
End of the line, sweetheart!
So this is where you hang out.
How long you been racing?
Since my parents died.
I guess all the speed and danger helped take me out of myself.
Made the pain go away.
You wouldn't understand.
You'd be surprised.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge so...
...they kicked me out.
But I've already won the money I need to do what I've always dreamed.
Don't say you want to join the circus.
Alfred has supported me my whole life and I'm going to pay him back.
I'll take him away from this dismal life of servitude.
What are you talking about?
Listen, this whole master-servant thing...
...it's really ridiculous.
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...
...and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Paying someone to prepare your meals...
...do laundry, clean dishes, you call that family?
Alfred's happy.
Happy?
You honestly don't know, do you?
How he's hiding the pain all the time.
Alfred's sick.
Alfred's not sick.
He's dying.
Dying?
Why didn't he tell us?
You know Alfred, he'd never say anything.
But I can tell.
I can't believe it.
I know.
Icehead, you got a visitor.
Your sister is here to see you.
Sister?
Brother, dear...
...I heard you were blue.
Don't mind us, ma'am.
You can speak freely.
I don't mind you at all.
Men...
...the most absurd of God's creatures.
We give you life...
...and we can take it away just as easily.
- Right!
- Whatever.
I really am to die for.
Impressive!
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman...
...have been impressed by you.
In fact...
...I propose a pairing.
I've come to set you free.
An enticing offer...
...but...
...what does the lady want in return?
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.
His name is Bane.
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!
What are you, about a 50, big and tall?
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.
I'm running on empty.
I need the diamonds.
I'll help you grab your rocks.
Bane...
...dear...
...an exit, please.
Reinforced steel.
Not good.
Always winterize your pipes.
While I get my diamonds, you and "meatloaf" retrieve my wife.
You never mentioned a wife!
Come on.
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.
Alfred, are you well?
As well as can be expected, sir.
My friend, I know you're sick.
I can get you the best doctors.
I have seen the best doctors.
A gentleman does not discuss his ailments. It is not civilized.
I hope that I have taught you at least that much, Master Bruce.
Have you ever...
...regretted your life working here?
Looking after heroes?
No, sir.
My only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Not all the heroes wear masks.
Freeze has escaped!
We got this off the Arkham surveillance camera.
Poison Ivy.
2 nights ago...
...Gotham Airport, these two arrive by charter from South America.
They put 10 security guards in the hospital...
...left a businessman dead from organic poisoning, stole his limousine.
This is definitely the same pair that sprang Freeze.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Poison Ivy... why would she help Freeze?
She's definitely evil.
She was all I could think about, like I was in love...
I know, then the feeling vanished.
I can't believe we fought over a bad guy.
Bad, yes. Guy, no.
Well, I'm totally over her.
Me too. Definitely.
- Great stems, though.
- Buds too.
Those are nice.
Here we go.
It's Nora Fries.
She's still alive.
He adapted his freezing technology to reverse the disease.
He found a cure for the disease in some stages.
There she is.
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue the bride.
We'll meet back at my place.
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the Bat and Bird.
You leave those boys to me.
Go!
- Can he save her?
- Her case is too advanced.
But maybe someday...
...with more research...
Poison Ivy.
I hate uninvited guests.
My lungs are freezing!
Chilled...
...to perfection.
No beauty.
Just the beast.
Hey, there, pretty birdie.
Give yourself up. If you surrender...
To you?
Polly want a kiss?
There's something about an anatomically correct...
...rubber suit that puts fire in a girl's lips.
Why are all the gorgeous ones homicidal maniacs? Is it me?
Enough...
...sweet talk.
First you'll tell me where Freeze is, then you're going to jail.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
That's why every Poison Ivy
Action Figure comes with him!
Try not to make a mess when you die.
Hold it right there!
Stop!
Living in the shadow of the big, bad Bat.
You don't need him.
You're the star.
I can see it now:
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.
Let me guide you.
Let me kiss you.
Stop! Don't kiss her.
The victim at the airport, toxins introduced orally.
- What are you saying?
- Why does she want to kiss us?
- I bet her lips are poisoned.
- Poisoned kiss?
You have issues with women!
You can't stand that she'd kiss me and not you.
Something would be mine, not yours.
Exit, Bane.
Exit!
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.
I'm going solo!
What happened?
How'd they get away?
I've never been good with competition.
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?
Make yourself right at home.
Where's my wife?
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.
- She's dead.
- You lie!
I'm sorry.
Their bones will turn to ice!
Their blood will freeze in my hands!
Kill them, of course.
But why stop there?
Why should only
Batman and Robin die...
...while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Yes!
If I must suffer...
...humanity will suffer with me!
I shall repay them for sentencing me to a life without human comfort.
I will blanket the city in endless winter!
First...
...Gotham.
And then...
...the world!
Just what I had in mind.
Everything dead on Earth except us.
A chance for...
...Mother Nature to start again.
Behold...
...the dawn of a new age.
My mutant plants have the strength of the deadliest animals.
Once you have frozen mankind, these babies will overrun the globe.
And we shall rule them.
For we will be...
...the only two people left in the world.
Yes.
Adam...
...and Evil.
You distract the Bat and Bird...
...while I prepare...
...to freeze...
...Gotham!
It's Stage 1 of Macgregor's Syndrome.
I'm sorry.
All we can do is make him comfortable.
Thank you, Doctor.
Macgregor's Syndrome is what Fries' wife had.
Alfred's condition is less severe.
Fries' research said...
...he cured a case like it, just didn't say how.
No one else is even close.
I'm late for the dedication, then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone.
- Like hell you do.
- Don't push me right now.
Or what? No one can capture Ivy but the big, bad Bat?
Right.
You want her for yourself.
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.
I know she loves me and not you, and it's driving you crazy.
That's why you stopped us from kissing.
- You're not thinking straight.
- But I am.
For the first time in a long time.
I want a Robin signal in the sky, all right?
I'm tired of living in your shadow.
All that ends now.
I'm sorry, Uncle.
I was too late.
You must do something for me.
Find my brother, Wilfred...
...your uncle, wherever he is, and give him...
...this.
I have duties that he must fulfill in my stead.
Only family can be trusted.
What is it?
It is a sacred trust of two good men...
...whom I have the honor of calling "son."
Take it to Wilfred...
...and I implore you...
...never open it.
You look so like your mother.
Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.
Everyone who 's anyone...
...has flocked to the observatory...
...and tonight's star-studded dedication of the new telescope.
And here's the man of the hour himself...
...Bruce Wayne.
Excuse me.
Commissioner.
- How are you?
- Good. You know Julie?
How are you?
Good to see you.
Young man.
Lovely to see you again.
Thank you.
Commissioner Gordon...
...I've always wondered...
...where does that big, old Batlight come from?
Why...
...it's...
...on top of Police Headquarters.
I'd just...
...love to see it.
But you probably don't have access.
Why, dear lady...
...I am the police commissioner.
I have the keys right here in my pocket.
Would you like to see it?
Who are you, dear lady?
On second thought, you're way too old for me.
No, I'm not.
Please...
...come back.
What are you doing? Come on.
Show me how the satellites work.
First...
...I will turn Gotham into an icy graveyard...
...then...
...I will pull Batman's heart from his body...
...and feel it freeze in my hands.
Revenge!
Quickly, Bane.
Quickly now.
Let there be light.
Only family can be trusted?
I'm family.
Access denied.
Access denied.
I spend my entire life trying to beat back death.
Everything I've done, everything I'm...
...capable of doing...
But I can't save you.
There's no defeat in death...
...Master Bruce.
Victory comes in defending...
...what we know is right...
...while we still live.
I love you, old man.
And I love you too.
Access denied.
This better be one hell of a secret.
Margaret.
Peg.
Access allowed.
The combined power of the telescope's reflecting crystals...
...will complete...
...my freezing engine.
No matter what they tell you, Mr. Bane...
...it is the size of your gun that counts.
Where are you going?
It's not a Batlight, it's a Robin signal.
Ivy's calling me.
Her name's Pamela Isley.
She must've stolen Gordon's keys and changed the signal.
She did it for me, for love.
She infected us with pheromones.
I'm under some kind of magic spell?
She wants to kill you.
You'd say anything to keep her away from me.
To keep her for yourself.
You said being a team means trusting your partner.
Sometimes, counting on someone else is the only way to win. Remember?
You weren't talking about partners, but about being a family.
So I'm asking you...
...friend, partner...
...brother...
...will you trust me now?
- All the crystals are in place.
- Thank you.
Hi!
I'm sorry about the door.
Is the party over?
Who is this nutball?
If revenge...
...is a dish best served cold...
...then put on your Sunday finest.
It's time...
...to feast!
Tonight...
...hell freezes over.
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert. Identify.
Uncle Alfred, it's me. Barbara.
I expected you might find
your way down here, child.
I programmed my brain algorithms...
... into the Batcomputer...
... and created a virtual simulation.
I'd like to help Batman and Robin.
I anticipated you would...
... and took the liberty
to create something in your size.
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.
Hi there.
Is your thumb the only part of you that's green?
You will just have to find out.
I want us to be together, but...
...you must be serious about turning over a new leaf.
I need a sign...
How about "Slippery when wet."
...of trust.
Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Freeze has taken the new telescope and turned it into a giant freezing gun.
He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I've got to stop him.
One kiss...
...my love.
For luck.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.
Time to die, little Robin.
I hate to disappoint you, but...
...rubber lips are immune to your charms.
See you!
You're not the only one who can set a trap, Venus.
Sorry...
...my vines have a crush on you.
Got to go.
So many people to kill, so little time.
You're about to become compost.
Using feminine wiles to get what you want?
Trading on your looks?
Read a book.
That passive-aggressive number went out long ago.
You give women a bad name.
As I told Lady Fries, when I pulled her plug...
...this is a one-woman show.
I don't think so.
Curses!
Freeze is going to ice the city.
I know.
And you are?
Batgirl.
That's not P.C. What about
Batperson or Batwoman?
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the Batcave.
We must change the locks.
- She knows who we are.
- We must kill her.
Later. We have work to do.
Let's kick some ice.
We have 11 minutes to thaw the city.
Gotcha!
Now!
Shield.
I'll finish off the city.
You kill the kids, but...
...leave me the Bat.
No sign of the snowman.
Maybe he melted.
No, he's just hibernating.
These heaters will thaw them.
I hope you've got
10 million more of those toys.
8 minutes and they're ice cubes forever.
Sunlight could reverse the freezing process.
Sunrise isn't for 5 hours.
Here.
It's morning in the Congo.
We'll relay sunlight...
From below the equator...
It'll take the satellites a minute to realign, but...
Damn!
Damn?
Damn's not good.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.
I realign, you thaw the mirrors.
Tonight's forecast:
A freeze is coming.
Bye-bye.
I got you!
No.
I got you.
It's one of those days!
Dirty fighter!
The tube!
Yay, Batman!
Hey, Freeze.
The heat is on.
You all right down there?
Here goes.
Hang on.
You're doing it!
You've lost, Freeze.
I think not.
Bombs away, Batman.
Freeze in hell, Batman!
What should we do now?
Pray.
Hang on!
Grab on to my belt!
Thank you, Batman!
Need a ride?
- Most of Gotham's still frozen.
- It's midnight.
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.
The satellites could do it, but it'd take a computer genius.
I'm on it.
No, I'm on it.
Have to do it upside down.
Men!
Everything the hard way.
You're pretty good at this, little girl.
Watch and learn, little boy.
They say it'll be a beautiful day.
I'm taking you back to Arkham Asylum.
Go on.
Kill me too.
Just as you killed my wife.
I didn't kill your wife.
As I told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...
... this is a one-woman show.
But she's not dead.
We found her, restored her.
She's still frozen alive...
...waiting for you to find a cure.
She lives?
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.
But to give life...
...that's true power.
A power you once had.
She's alive.
So I'm asking you.
Victor Fries...
...help me save another life.
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome Stage 1.
And maybe you can also save the life of the man your wife once loved.
He's still inside you, Victor.
Buried...
...deep beneath the snow.
Will you help me...
...Doctor?
Take 2 of these...
...and call me in the morning.
I'll have your wife moved to the lab at Arkham.
You'll be able to continue your research there.
All we can do now is wait...
...and hope.
He loves me.
He loves me not.
He loves me.
Not!
Surprise.
I'm your new cellmate.
And I've come to make your life a living hell.
Prepare...
...for a bitter harvest.
Winter...
...has come at last.
Are you...?
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.
And quite well, it seems!
Thanks to you, son.
Thanks to you all.
Well done, Bruce.
You too.
Well done.
I got one question.
When we fell off the telescope, why didn't you try and save us?
It's the first time I've fallen and you weren't there.
I figured you could handle it.
You know, sometimes counting on somebody else is the only way to win.
Excuse me.
I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.
Yeah, that was me.
I did it all by myself.
That was me.
You are going back to school.
You'll never win this argument.
Partners?
Partners.
Partners.
We're going to need a bigger cave.
These are gonna be great
Can you imagine if your wife ever found these?
Crys, come on
Put down the camera
This is such good shit
Come on, Crys
Crys, come on...
What do I look like to you, a '"Playboy'" bunny?
You're not gonna come and take pictures... and let me take the picture
I'm gonna fill up the whole scrapbook
Peisha, this is the most fun
Peisha!
Oh, shit
Fuck
Crys
Ow! Fuck!
Crys, Crys
What's wrong with him?
Shit
What's wrong, Crys? What happened?
Jesus Christ
Don't look at us, it was his shit
Are you sure he's dead?
Take the girls to the club
I got to call his people
I can't believe I voted for this asshole
It's not about winning ball games
It's about emotion
You know what that is?
Emotion?
The Lakers are not the Lakers without Rambis
He was the spark, the inspiration
He was white
I didn't say that
But did it ever occur to you that's why they let him go?
Rambis left on his own
Is that a brew in that bag?
On his own?
Yeah, on his own, read the paper
Oh, come on!
Christ, Moony, we're on duty... and that shit you're eating is sixty percent grease
He's got one
Dillnick? I don't believe it
Miss? Excuse me, miss
You talking to me, Elvis?
Oh, shit
What kind of action you looking for?
I was kind of hoping you could tell me
Translation, he doesn't know
Now she's gonna stick her balloons through the window
Magic fingers are twenty
Fifty puts the pig in the blanket
You want something oral, see you dentist
Did you see what he was wearing tonight?
He wasn't wearing that striped thing, was he?
So, what?
Looking for something kinky?
Want to hear the chef's special?
No, I'm sure whatever you do will be fine
Hope you have lots of raincoats... because I don't ride bareback anymore
We're meeting him at the Bowl?
Yeah, sounds like we better hurry
Nice jacket
Seersucker makes me hot
Just relax
Just let me take control
You'll love it, believe me
Stone
Come on, Moon, forget him
We got to meet Dill, Moon, leave him alone
Ah, Jesus
Promotions are next week
He's speeding
Being a cop's like being a pitcher, Harry
To hit the strikes, you've got to...
Risk your balls, for what, Moon?
What is this?
This is initiative, I'm showing initiative
No, this is harassment
There is something very perverse about you and this Stone
Perverse? Yeah, perverse
It wasn't his fault she left you
Yeah? Yeah
Bullshit!
Hollywood, this is seven-one
Dillnick is making a Redi-Whip delivery to the parking lot at the Bowl
Can somebody take her off his hands?
Thanks
Tell them to take their time
Phil, can you get the champagne?
Have a staff member find his body in the morning
Police can notify his wife
Washington wants full damage control
Understand?
Sure you can handle these girls?
It's my business
It's your business if you don't
Graham
This is out of our league, Jack
It's also out of our jurisdiction
Come on, we're in Beverly Hills
Nice suit
It's OK, it's OK
He's just picking up her and her girlfriend
He's their lawyer
They don't look safe to drive
Get lost, pal
Getting strange
Be cool, now
What? I didn't say anything
Stone! Somebody's calling you
Stone!
What?! What, what, what?
Zara, come on!
What the hell are you doing?
You out of your mind?
Move over! I'm gonna drive
You said you were gonna...
You said you were gonna quit
I want a promotion, Moon, not a goddamn suspension
He's running, Harry
Well, you shot at him!
He's dirty I know he's dirty!
I'm finally gonna nail his black ass to the wall
If you have any drugs in your purse... would you please just throw them out the window?
I don't believe...
You know, I could be disbarred for this shit
Leon!
Give me the purse...
Hold the girls and get some backup
Oh, Moon
Ah, Jesus
Stay put
Stone!
Move
Fuck
Well, it's about time
Now, look, I'm a lawyer, all right?
And this is a clear-cut case of harassment
Now, for the past six months this poor excuse for a police off...
Are you gentlemen gonna keep this mad dog off me, or what?
Thank you
All right, look...
I don't know what the problem you have with...
Jesus, what the hell have you been eating?
Your ass, nigger
You called him the '"n'" word?
You left Dillnick with a car date at the Hollywood Bowl... fired your weapon without cause at a private club... participated in a high-speed car chase... then you decked a black lawyer in front of a hundred people... and called him the '"n'" word?
I made the arrest
You made squat, Moony... and I am sick and tired of your street cowboy attitude... and your racist bullshit
But let me try and get through to you,
Moony
There are those of us who can say the '"n'" word... and there are those of us who cannot
Now, I can say the '"n'" word
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger
See, I can say the damn word all I want... but your can't
In fact, Moony, if I catch your little perverse, bigoted... bullshit mouth saying it again...
I'm going to personally tear you out a new asshole
Is this going to affect my... promotion evaluation?
Promotion?
You are suspended, Sergeant
Leave your piece and your shield with Rinselle on the way out of here
Called him the '"n'" word and want a promotion
Sorry, Moon
Did you do it?
Moon?
You doing OK?
You don't look so good
Thank you
What was this all about tonight?
Is he pimping for you now?
I don't deserve that, Moon
Neither does he
What were you doing?
I didn't tell you I finished night school finally... and I got my application into
Valley Arts College... and I saved up all the tuition...
What?
I don't know why I keep forgetting to drop this off
Every time I'm near your house, it's not the right time
Jesus Christ!
Why do you have to keep doing that?
I need it For what?
Self-defense
From what?
Why do you carry a gun?
I'm a cop!
Yeah, well, I'm not
Do you still have the fishbowl?
Yeah
Can you just put this in there with the others?
And, like, if something happens to me... have them print it up
You know, like, sprinkle them over Hollywood Boulevard like ashes
Coming? Yeah
Crys
Bye, Moon
Because I love you so
Come here, here you go
Come on now
That's yours, yeah, that's yours
OK, you can have some of that, too, all right?
Hey, come here
Look at that
Come out of here
There you go
You want some of this?
Just a bit
There you go
Yeah, I know, glad to see you, too
Get out of here, will you?
I'm trying to give you stuff you like
Get out, what's the matter with you?
That's it, Chuck, you don't get any more
Well, maybe just a... just a little more
Chuck!
What are you saying?
That's it? He's dead?
He will be without a new heart... and the odds of finding a
B-positive donor...
Dr. Posner
Excuse me
He was a cop?
Yeah, vice
How the hell did he get in that kind of condition?
Vice
Sad news for the State of California and the nation
Senator James Marquand... one of the most respected leaders on Capitol Hill... is dead at fifty four
Found by a staff member in his
Bel Air home this morning... the author of the new anti-drug legislation... is believed to have died from heart failure
The President described Marquand as a true gentleman... a brilliant statesman...
OK, which one of you guys said the Hail Mary?
The donor's condition?
It was a car accident... severe trauma to the head and lower back... severed brainstem
Otherwise, the guy's a cream puff
His form's in order?
We got him on file
He had it marked on his license
Anything medical?
This guy's squeaky clean about everything but his occupation
Pusher? Close
Proctologist? Getting warmer
Don't tell me he's a lawyer
But don't sweat malpractice
He's too dead to sue
Shit, turn that down
I got it
OK, he's asleep, come on, come on
You sure he knows?
It's only been a few weeks
Yeah, the doctor told him yesterday
Everything, right?
Yeah, everything, now will you come on?
You got it on him?
It won't stand up
Well, them, prop it up
You sure he knows, Harry?
He knows, he knows
Harry?
One, two, three, four...
Can't get enough of you, babe...
Can't get enough of you...
Ooh, darling...
Can't get enough of you...
Can't get enough of you, babe...
Can't get enough of you...
All I want is you, babe...
Don't you know it's true?
What the fuck is this?
Oh, shit
He doesn't know
Moony, stop! Come back here! Mo...
Posner said he was gonna tell you,
Moon
We didn't know
Jack, what do you think you're doing out of bed?
You put it in
Now you take it out!
Want to tell me where he had it?
I want you to exercise, Jack... or you can throw these ten months of rehab... out the window, understand?
No drinking, no smoking, no fatty foods
No more roundups, no more drug busts... no more asinine car chases
You're a desk sergeant now, a career paper jock
You got it?
Yeah, I got it
I didn't want to take you back, Moony
Central made me
Just because we got the same color heart... don't go thinking we're blood
Hey, Moony, starting to walk with a little rhythm
Funny
Hey, Moondog...
Nice tan, Moony
They say the heart's not the only new equipment you got
You wish
Terri... did you ever locate Crystal Gerrity?
She's the carrot top Detective Zara was checking out
Detective Zara?
Yeah, Harry, she's a hooker, right?
Yeah
He said she'd picked up a couple of speeding tickets out near Malibu
Right, about six months ago
The addresses she gave on both citations were phony
Zip on the Peisha chick, too
They're out there, but nobody knows where
Could you run it through the machine for me again?
Well, anything's possible for a little of your honey
You got a dirty mind
See you
Now, that was all Harry's idea, Jack
If he's gonna ride with you, you got to get him to get rid of those stripes
Ever since that night at the Bowl he thinks that that's his lucky jacket
Shit
Well, we got to go
Yeah, go
Later
Yeah, Harry
Let me see your shield
Come on
Looks nice
Looks real good on you
Thanks
Keep the change
Thanks
Don't eat that
Clogs the arteries
It makes your breath stink
Listen, ass...
Trust me
Now, look, look
I wasn't even gonna say anything, you know
I tried to give you a chance to get into the groove... and as bad as those Camels are...
I was more than willing to let a few of those go by... but when you start shoving this dog meat into your face...
I'm sorry, I just have to step in
I have to do something, now put it down
Put it down
Moony, put it down
Put it down
Didn't you listen to the doctor?
Don't you know what this shit does to your heart?
Moony, look, you're looking very stupid now
You are dancing with a cheeseburger
We can do this all day, OK?
But you look real silly... dancing around with a cheeseburger
The only person that can see me is you
What's up with that guy?
You know, you can't get away from me
This is a very good-looking car
I mean, this is absolutely fabulous
Has it ever been washed?
It's weird, I know, it's very weird
I'm not even used to it myself
It's kind of like that out-of-body... you know, astral-projection,
Shirley Maclaine thing
I mean, one minute...
I'm sitting in the front seat of my car, and I'm dying
Next time I know... boom!
I'm standing in the operating room looking at myself... while they're pulling my heart out of me
I mean, it was like that...
What's the name of that movie?
Oh, this is very good, this is good
Going back and forth is good because it stimulates the heart
It makes you a lot strong...
Are you listening to me?
You are listening to me?
Hey, wait a minute
You're ignoring me, aren't you?
Now, listen, I didn't want my heart in you... any more than you wanted my heart in you... and if I knew that my heart was gonna be... inside a piece of racist scum like you...
I never would've donated it in the first place
But that's OK, you know, because life's a bitch... and then you die, you know?
It's true, isn't it?
Hey... but I didn't die! I was murdered!
I didn't get a real good look... if it was a Cutlass Sierra or a... but I did get a real good look at the driver... right before he ran me off the road
Hey, Moony, you OK?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine
Aren't you gonna... Wait a minute!
Aren't you gonna talk to me?
I thought you said you wanted to be a detective, huh?
I thought you said you wanted that gold shield?
Well, this is your opportunity, this is it
Now are you gonna talk to me, or aren't you?
No!
I'm gonna prescribe a little medication,
Jack
Nothing serious
Just something to calm your nerves... help the hallucinations
I take these every once in a while... hoping my wife will disappear
But you mean that this is a normal thing?
Oh, sure it is
This could be perfectly normal
A psycho-chemical aberration of some kind
We're just beginning to learn... how transplants affect the human body and mind
Take a couple of days off
You'll feel much better
Is that tranquilizer working yet?
Say yes, you want to wind up in a mental institution?
Jack? Yes!
Yeah, it's working fine
It's OK
Jesus! Chuck!
Personally, I think that this racism this refusal to acknowledge me... stems from feelings of inadequacy
I mean, you look at me
What do you see?
Someone college-educated, damn good-looking... hung like a Shetland pony, and you feel threatened
Am I hitting a nerve?
Come on, Chuck
Oh, I see, you can talk to the cat, but you can't talk to me
Get out of the way, Shithead
Ohh! You can talk to me, thank you
Racial prejudice I can understand... but ghost prejudice?
An entirely new concept
As a matter of fact...
I think you're breaking new ground in this area
Hey! Close the door
I can't, the only thing I can move is you
Shit
It's hard to believe Crys could live in a pigpen like this
How long was it for, huh?
A month or two?
Four
Four?
And she wasn't hooking when she was living with me
Yeah, probably too busy cleaning, huh?
You won't go away, will you?
Well, best as I can figure,
I go where you go
As long as that heart's beating we're attached
Which is why you won't be eating that bacon, that chili, that...
Polish sausage?
Look, go to hell!
That's what I'm trying to avoid
Now, look, Moony, you don't have to like me... but you are gonna have to live with me now, whatever problem you had with me because of Crys... leave it behind you because you're gonna need me... if you want to help me find...
Find her?
Yeah
What do you know?
Only what happened the night
I was killed
She have something to do with that?
Yeah, now, she and the other girl
Peisha... they both work for this big-time gangster... called himself John Graham
He dealt strictly to the upper classes
You know, drugs, girls...
Yeah, yeah, I know, Pimp to the stars
Sounds like your kind of client
Say, say, don't go there, all right?
I represent the girls, not their employers
Anyway, Crys called me from the country club... said she was having a little legal trouble... and asked me to pick her up
You give all your clients that kind of service?
Well, she was upset
Is that why you hit her?
I was upset
Oh, you were both upset
Yeah, we were both upset!
All right, Moony?
Why don't you wash your dishes here... for crying out loud?
Why did you run from me?
What?
Come on, you're dead now
Well, Peisha was holding some crack that she got...
I knew it! You knew what?
You lucky son of bitch!
If I'd have caught you...
You couldn't have caught my mother,
Moony
I probably got my heart attack from you.
Well, had I known, I would've surren...
Can ghosts get colds?
I'm allergic to cats
But you're dead
It's psychological
What's so funny?
A hypochondriac spook
What the fuck was all that about?
Now we're even
This guy who allegedly ran you off the road...
Are you here or not here?
Yeah, I'm here
What was his name?
Teller, he was the muscle you saw with the girls at the club
If he ran you off the road, they think you know something
The legal problem Crys called you about... maybe it was drugs
I don't think so
It was something more, something bigger
I tried to find out from the girls but they wouldn't talk
At least not that night
I didn't make it to the next morning, so...
Yeah, it's just on the left here
Turn at the next corner
This is Century Luxury Villas
These things start at almost a mil, huh?
Yeah, so?
Fix your collar and try not to act like a cop
Shit
How much were you pulling down a year?
The mortgage on a place like this has gotta be, what, six grand a month?
That's my lizard pot
He's got my lizard pot
Twelve times six, seventy-two?
Hey, you got my lizard pot!
With tax, you're looking at eighty-five grand a year!
Hey, you got a pool!
He's got my lizard pot
He's got my cactus
Hey, that's my... where you going with...
This is a lot of money
This is a lot of money
Where are you going with my cactus?
An awful lot of money
What's going on here?
Well, it's open house
'"All furniture, household effects...
'"and objet d'art may be purchased'"
Oh, mama, no
No, I left you the house
I didn't tell you you could sell it
Well, what else is the old lady gonna do with it?
Fuck you, too
It's sterling
Actually, I was more interested in the picture
You can take all the pictures if you like
In fact, I'll pay you to get rid of this harem
My mother's a church-going woman, so watch what you say
Hello, Mommy
When I think of all the in-and-out that went on in here
Not one grandchild to show for it
Well, I was planning on settling down
He always said he was planning on settling down
Does this hump pen look like he was settling down to you?
Hump pen? This place has style
His idea of style was my idea of obscenity
I want to unload everything to do with it
Yeah, but not at K-Mart prices
Do you know this woman?
Do I know you?
I'm a cop You look it
I told you to fix your collar
I'm trying to locate this girl...
Crys Gerrity
I was wondering, can I look through your son's Rolodex?
You can have my son's Rolodex
What?
But don't ask me about his women
Have you seen her since your son's accident?
A cop got his heart, you know?
He knows I know
His name is Moony
I know, yeah, so's mine
She cried almost as much as I did at the funeral
Such a pretty girl
Held my hand most of the day
The last time I saw her was when she came by here... to pick up a few things
It was near Thanksgiving time, I think
Do you know where she was going?
She didn't say, she just drove off... with that slick man in his red Ferrari
Yes, this is John Graham
Any messages?
Jackson who?
Moony
What's that? Is that a scratch there?
Can you buff that out, please?
And use the toothbrush on the wheels
If you want to get to Graham, you gotta trust me
Listen, asshole, already I've been insulted... by the car park guy, the guy at the door
We're not leaving, Moony
Now, this may be fun to you, but I'm damned if I'm gonna... pop for another three-dollar tea bag
Will you keep it down, please?
No, if I don't hit the can soon...
Moony, the man is smart
That's why he has an answering service stead of a direct line
Now, would you rather him call you back at the police station... or a place that makes him feel more comfortable... like the Beverly Palm Hotel?
Call for you, Mr. Moony
All right, remember
Howard Steadman is your best friend
Tip him a deuce
Two dollars
Tip him a deuce for the phone
Thank God nobody can see me
Jackson Moony
Jackson Moony, John Graham
Sorry to pull you away from the pool on such a delicious day... but I got your message on my service... and I don't believe we've ever met
I'm from New York, actually
I'm here on business
Howard Steadman said that you had a redhead named Crystal... that you might be able to put me in touch with
It's a impossibility
Can you fix me up tomorrow night?
Well, as you probably know,
Howard's in Yugoslavia... working on his picture, so it's impossible for me... to cross-check your reference
Would it help if I mentioned... his night of leather in Palm Springs?
Crys said they were into gymnastics
You must be very good friends
You're working tomorrow night
That's all we could find on him
No address, no priors
Name's probably phony
OK, thanks
This Graham's gonna be hard to find
Which is why you gotta keep your date with her
You're dreaming!
The guy deals with high rollers
I can't afford lunch
Where am I gonna get that kind of money?
Or class?
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?
You think I got no class, huh?
You think wearing an Italian suit gives you class?
It gives you nothing, nothing
He see his doctor?
Yesterday
He said Posner gave him some new medication
Doesn't seem to be working
Why don't you get off my back?
Just get off my back!
Go on, get the fuck off!
Better keep an eye on him
Christ! What is it with you? Jesus!
Let me know what he's up to
Shit
A bowling alley?
I didn't know you people did this
Yeah, and we swim, too
Now, look, just relax, all right?
We're just here to pick up a little pocket change
You're with the owner
The what?
The owner, you think I got rich defending hookers?
You know what the cash return is on a pair of bowling shoes?
We're on our way back to the pin setters
Just... loosen up
Two drink minimum if you don't bowl
Yeah, that's right
There's a two drink minimum
There's nothing wrong with making a little profit
Now say hello to Bubba
Ask him how his mother is
Order a couple of beers
Hello, Bubba, how's your mother?
She died last summer
Well, I'm a little behind
I'll take a couple of beers
Which way to the pin setters?
Stone!
Every one of these mothers is a Black Panther hungry for white meat
I'm gonna wind up dish of the day
What are we doing here?
See that hole over there?
The one that looks like a duck?
Yeah
You feel a pipe in there? Yeah
All right, pull it out
Yeah, that's it
Jesus!
My emergency cash reserve
How much is in here?
Two hundred thousand dollars
And I'm the only guy who was ever able to take it with him
Don't want your beers?
Have a beer
Yeah, maybe just one Yeah, one beer
Can I help you?
Hey, it's my brother Archimedes
You find what you were looking for back there?
Nice guy, I left him the bar
A few balls, a couple of pins
Here it is
How do they know about my stash?
And maybe a hundred and fifty grand?
How did you know... 150?
I left $200,000...
It's supposed to be two hundred thousand
Oh, I see, you steal from your own brother
You own... you flesh...
You know, Ma said you was...
You know, if I wasn't dead, I'll...
Hit him one time for me, Moony, would you, please?
Did you know that this is extortion money?
That your brother was about to be brought up... on Federal charges when he died?
Yeah, slap him one time for me
Now, I can walk out of here with this evidence...
Or I can walk out of here with this evidence and you
It's your choice, Archimedes
Right
Hold it, hold it, hold it, wait
What?
Oh, shit!
Jesus!
Get him out of there!
That was the most stupid...
I'm sorry, just start... let's go!
Go, go, go!
You want to tell me what the hell that was all about?
So I was talking to a friend of mine the other day... and I hate to drop names... you know that, but I said, '"Bobby... '"
Well, that's Bobby DeNiro, but that's beside the point
'"Bobby, the thing is this... '"
Listen, what time is it?
It's time for you to get your big, fat, extra-crispy-bucket-o'-chicken... two-liter-pepsi-cola-drinking ass out of bed
That's what time it I, allez, allez!
We must exercise!
Come on, Jack, let's go!
And one, two, three, four!
Come on, Jack,
Your public is waiting
Public, my ass
Well, it'll be your ass if you don't hurry up and get up
We have to go downtown, we have to exercise... we have to get into some suits
Get your black ass out of here, will you?
Black man!
'"Get your black ass out of here'"
I like that, get down, brother!
Give me five! All right!
There's five
Fuck off!
Shit! I never knew... there were so many hills in Hollywood
Fuck off!
Come on, come on, look at me!
I'm running circles around you
And you're supposed to be a cop, huh?
Is this L.A.'s finest, huh?
I'm a cop! Yeah, yeah!
Oh, well!
Get the fuck out of here! Shit!
He bought an $80,000 Mercedes-Benz with cash?
It's not the Jack Moony I know
I don't know what the hell he's doing
Whatever he's doing, it's got to be illegal
Well, we better get ready
They're dropping Crys off at eight
Did she really like this stuff?
She never seemed to mind 'em on me
Oh, come on, Moony, look
We fooled around, all right?
She took some pictures
That was the end of it
It wasn't serious
I was a single guy, you heard my mother
Last thing I needed or wanted was to be tied down
Hey, look, what you gotta face is the fact that she left the old Jack Moony
See, this is not the same girl who was on the street corner... dating cops and eating cheeseburgers
She's a different woman now
Same job
Yeah, but didn't she ever tell you about going to art school?
It was a pipe dream, you saw her stuff
Oh, and we're art critics now, huh?
You know, you see a kid fishing in a mud puddle
Is that any reason to take away his pole?
People have dreams, Moony
They have ambitions
And when she tells you about her dreams... you gotta respect them, you gotta listen
I always listened
Yeah?
I listened
All right, all right
What's the name of her dog back home?
Henry
How many sisters does she have?
Two... Lisa and Joanie
What's her favorite movie?
'"Rambo'"
'"Rambo'"?
'"Pinocchio'"
And I knew all of that in the first half-hour
You see? That's why she left Ohio,
Moony
Nobody listened
Nobody took her seriously... and you're wondering why she left you
I kept her off the streets
Yes, by wrapping her up so tight, she couldn't move
You see, you want to keep everybody in little boxes
You want to keep me in the ghetto
You want to keep Crys back at home
Even that knucklehead Wendt
And you tell me that you don't resent him being your superior officer
Yeah, you can't, can you?
You see, we're all like the film in the goldfish bowl at your home
You want to keep us all right there... where you can see us, don't you?
You don't want to let it out to be developed
You know how much that stuff costs to process?
Hey, it costs to go to art school
It costs to be a lawyer
It costs to be a fucking detective
Some of us are willing to pay the price, Moony
Hey, there's nothing to be scared of, Moony
Nobody's out to get you
You don't have to be scared that we're all gonna leave you behind
Would you like something from the bar?
Yeah, ask her first
What do you think?
A glass of wine
Wine list, a couple of Evians
The wine list and two Evians
The wine list
I didn't know you knew what Evian was
Bottled water
I'm learning
What are you doing?
Is this some kind of a setup?
What do you mean?
Are you gonna bust me?
For what?
Bein' beautiful?
Touche
Did you process any of my film?
Why?
I wondered
It's still in the goldfish bowl
Good
Nice suit
Yeah
Did you polish your fingernails?
Did I tell you I knew what a woman likes?
You can't afford that on a cop's salary
Oh, I, uh...
I came into some money
How?
Oh, shit, how?
Don't tell me it's an inheritance
No, she's too smart for that
Malpractice
Malpractice
Your heart surgery
Yeah, they stitched me up with a sponge inside
Good
Judges like that one
So then you quit the force and started buying Italian suits?
Right, yeah
I don't believe that
Yeah, neither do I
OK, maybe you better go and call Teller
That's dangerous
I don't want to
Lucky
How's Chuck?
He's fat
I would like to tempt you... with the chef's specials before you decide
For appetizer, we have a shitake and mushroom... on the salmon dim sum dumpling in a red currant sauce
Salmon dumplings in currant sauce
Are you still puttin' bourbon in his milk?
No
We're both reformed men
That's too bad
There is also a special poached scallop with taro... over a bed of squid ink fettuccine with a ginger root sauce
Do you remember your tablecloth?
Yeah
Well, I... I had it... I had it cleaned and mended
You didn't have to do that
No, you... you remember the armenian lady next door?
Mrs. Arkmanian
Yeah! Yeah
Well, she saw the, um, you know...
Embroidery?
Yeah, well, she said that was really good.
Then a duck feet, dim-sum style this, over a bed of arugula with a spicy rice vinegar...
Is he serious? He's serious
And finally we have the... egg roll with a... s-s-shredd-ed-ed squid...
'"Squeed'"
Shred-ed-ed squid!
Eggplant... fresh stalk fennel, salmon, ground oysters...
Excuse me
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Back off! Back off?
Look, I did not make this kind of investment... to see you blowing it with that girl!
I am not blowin' it!
Listen, I thank you for helpin' me find Crys...
I thank you for the car, for the hotel... for the clothes!
I even thank you for the goddamn nail polish!
This is my date... and my night... and I want you to back the hell off!
Oh, I see, I see
So, I can set up the date, I can buy you the clothes... but she starts making eyes at you... and you don't need me anymore, is that it?
No! I don't need you anymore
Well, did it occur to you that she's a pro?
Has it occurred to you that you're... that I'm paying for this?
Yes!
Yes, it did
But maybe I wanna pretend, huh?
Maybe it's easier for me to pretend... if her ex... whatever you were... is not hangin' over her shoulder... tellin' me to order squid dum-dum!
Dim sum
Dim sum Dim sum
And you're gonna ask her about what happened that night
Yeah! Yeah, OK, I'm gonna ask her!
Where's the waiter?
I think he has a few other tables
Yeah
Hey, why don't...
What?
What were you gonna say?
Where... of all the places in this city...
Where do you want to eat?
I don't get it
I always had to drag you down here
Hey, allow for a little growth
A little growth
I mean, you can only eat so much...
S-s-shredd-ed-ed squid!
Before eight-ball and tube steak looks pretty good.
So... how we doing?
We're down six points
Moon! What?
Hey! What?
Oh, you wanna play, huh?
Come on
You wanna play
So what do you wanna do?
I'll show you what I can do!
Stop it!
I didn't!
Yes, you did
Is it OK if I take this stuff off?
Sure
Whatever you want
Sometimes...
I just get so tired... of doing everything the hard way
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, God, I missed you
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Does it hurt?
Not much anymore
They say that the blood an tissue types... have to be an exact match
You and Leon
Blood brothers
Get out of here
Oh, Moon
He was a good guy
You would've liked him
You reminded me of him tonight
Maybe it's his heart
Oh, fuck
What's up?
I gotta go
You know...
I like... I liked your pictures
And all those things you were tellin' me?
I was listening
Like, I... I know you had a dog named Henry... and a couple of sisters
Lisa and, uh...
Joanie
Yeah
And your favorite movie is Pinocchio
Pinocchio?
Oh, please! Pinocchio?!
What am I always talkin' about?
The Parent Trap!
Moon!
So, you're using my material, too, huh?
Yeah, Pinocchio
So I lied, sue me
Put out that cigarette
It's her You smoked it
What else did you see?
Enough to know that you didn't ask her about what happened that night
I'm workin' up to it
That's bullshit, Moony
Look, she needs time
This is delicate!
I kept my part of the bargain
You asked me to back off, I backed off
I kept my part of the bargain
Now you keep yours
You're pissed because we're hittin' it off
Yes
No
Yes... no, I'm pissed because the guy who killed me isn't behind bars
You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me, Moony you wouldn't even be here, not with Crys... not at the Beverly Palm Hotel, not on this earth
So when she comes back in this room
I want you to ask her what happened!
Were you talkin' to someone?
Room service
Oh, room service
Don't order for me, I have to go
Ask her
Can't you stay for breakfast?
It's not me, it's Graham
Ask her
Call you at home
Yeah
Uh, Crys...
What? That... the night, uh...
Stone died... the night I chased you, remember?
Hard to forget
Mmm, yeah
Did anything happen before he picked you up that... might have caused his murder?
Oh, shit!
No, Crys... I knew it!
Crys, please...
Crys, listen to me! Crys!
Crys, please!
Crys, it's not like that! Listen! Crys!
Come on, Moony!
Hurry up! She's getting away
So are my pants!
Harry
Harry, I think something's going on down here!
Crys! Come on!
I shouldn't have asked her!
We should've waited!
For what? So you two could have another go in bed?
You stayed in the living room
Of course, you think I can learn anything... watching a white boy? Huh?
Well, according to Crys you can!
Oh, all right, Superman
Well, give it your best shot, then
That's it, you got it, you got it
Mercedes keys
They're all Mercedes keys!
Yeah, that one
Hey, Moon?
Harry?
What are you...
I found it
Bullshit
I inherited it
A bunch of crap
I was given it by a dead ni... lawyer... to find out who killed him
Very good
I didn't know you had it in you
Now, you see how easy that was?
Today is my golf day... and my foursome teed off about twenty minutes ago
Maybe if I hurry, I can catch them on the back nine
Hold him
He can't hold you
You can't hold me
Hmm, the hell I can't
Not without bail Not without bail
I got you, Moony
Maybe not this minute... but I got you
Who got you that hat?
I want you in here at eight tomorrow for a full psychiatric examination... and until that time, you are suspended!
Yeah, that's what you need, suspenders
And you leave your badge...
Leave my badge and my piece with Rinselle on the way out
Fore!
Fuck it!
Why the hell did I listen to you?
We gotta find Crys
We found her! You made me blow it!
Hey, I'm doin' this for you
For me? For you
For me? For you
You've just got me thrown off the force!
I'm on my way to a mental institution!
Well, nobody's perfect
Shit! Jack?
You... you OK?
Look, I just wanted you to know... that I was following you 'cause
I was concerned... not because of Wendt
Sure, Harry
I mean, you need help, partner
You really do
Yeah
Go home and get some sleep, OK?
Yeah
Get the fuck away from me!
Get away!
What?
Chuck, get out of there
Come on, Moony, you can't order an autopsy report... when you're on suspension
Well, do it in Harry's name
I'll clear it with him
The man was a U.S. Senator
What do I say we're looking for?
Cocaine
You know what kind of scandal this could be?
It's a cover-up thing, like the Redford movie
We're not gonna find anything in that autopsy report
Right, right, what's that got to do with finding Crys out here?
She had black spots on the bottom of her feet
Black spot... yeah?
It was beach tar
You know? Beach tar
There's not a lot of beaches up here that have enough to stick
Yeah? Right
Now, in police work, that... coupled with a Malibu speeding ticket... and you've got...
You got what?
Oh, get the fuck out of here
This is too easy
Now, wait a minute, Jack, remember...
I know what to say
Crys!
Shit!
Get out of my life, Moony
I'm not gonna do that
No, you don't understand
You have to leave, OK?
I'm not gonna do that, either
Moony, turn around and walk away
Crys, I developed the film
Why? Why did you do that?
You gave them to me
No, I gave it to you... because I knew you wouldn't develop it
You'd just throw it in the fishbowl
Until something happened to you!
Nothing's happened to me
Yes, it did! You met me!
Listen, Marquand died of a drug overdose, right?
Yes
Graham killed Stone on the chance... that you might have told him about it
Yes
Do they know about the pictures?
That's the only reason we're still alive
Has anyone seen them?
No, not yet, but I'm gonna take 'em down
Moon!
I know what you wanna do
You can't do it
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Leave
And don't do anything... please
Hey, listen to me!
Please, Moon!
Crys!
Go away!
They'll see you!
Listen!
I can help you get out of this!
No! We have a deal
You got a trap!
He can see us
There's nothing you can do about it
Moon... nothing's the same
You see that?
Everything's gone
No! It's not gone
They'll kill me
No! I'm an accessory
I'll go to jail
Well, testify for immunity!
They'll find me
Look, I can protect you!
I don't care what happens to me
Well, who the fuck do you care for?!
This is my baby
He already lost his father
You want him to lose me, too?
Stone?
My God
I was pregnant couple of months before he died
I never told him
Baby...
I didn't want it to look like I was trying... to force him into something
I want this baby
Hey, baby
Jesus
You wanted to marry him
Does that make a difference?
Oh, Jesus, he's so beautiful!
Thank you, baby
Hey... come...
Hey, hey, Moon, come on, hol...
Come on and hold him for me
Tell... you know, tell me how he feels
Come on, Moon
Tell me how he feels, huh?
Moon?
Hey, Moon, come on, tell me...
Hey, Moon, don't do this to me.
Come on, tell me how he's...
Moony, come on! Tell me how he feels!
Hey!
Moony!
Peisha
Ready to go get some Pampers?
Yeah, oK
Crys?
Sorry
That's OK, that's OK
Here, let me hold him
No... Come on
Oh, yeah
You're a big boy
I just got off the phone... with Senator Marquand's people
They're very upset with me
Seems that someone from the police department... has pulled out the Senator's autopsy file
And that wouldn't happen to be a Mr. Moony?
The jerk from last night?
Did you know he was a cop? Huh?
Did you? Did you know he was a cop?
Did you know your mommy was one of his old roomies?
Did you? Did you know that?
At least that's what Peisha tells me
I just got some very good Mexican brown
I hope she didn't O.D.
You lied to me
What?
Hey, look, look, you never should've left
That's the bottom line, all right?
She wanted me to leave... or weren't you listening?
The girl needs our help
Well, she don't need mine
The girl's in love with you, asshole!
Fuck off!
Yeah, well, fuck you!
She's in love with you!
What the hell has that got to do with anything?
I'm dead now!
Like hell you are!
Shit!
What is this shit?!
Fucking gotta be some kind of curse!
Me and Rambis, man, fuck!
Ha! You work your ass off, for what?
Fuckin' what?!
I'm not good enough for Crys!
Even my own heart ain't good enough!
Shit!
Fuckin' white curse!
No, it's not! It's a black fuckin' conspiracy!
A what?
You! You heard me!
You fuckin' people, you... you creep up around and just suck up to us!
You make us trust you... and then you... all the time, you're robbin' us blind!
Oh, we do that, huh?
You! You, you fuckin'...
Say it, Moony, say it!
Say it! Niggers, right? Coon, chinks!
Spics! Kike!
Mook!
Niggers! Niggers!
Niggers!
Moon?
Moon?
All right, just take... take it easy, take it easy
Moony, that you?
I know we've had problems, but...
I don't think rejecting my heart is the answer
You agree?
Yeah, I mean, there's other ways... we can vent our frustration
We could... we could go to the amusement park, uh... ride the bumper cars
Play Mike Tyson's video Nintendo
You could be Mike Tyson
I'll... l'll be the white guy
No, I wanna be Mike Tyson
Anyway, we can... ice hockey... uh, full-contact karate
I mean, we're mature men, aren't we?
I think we should just... just chalk this rejection episode... up to a learning experience... as something that will never happen again
You do agree?
Oh, good
That makes me breathe a lot easier
Now we gotta do something about Crys
If Graham's suspicious, no telling what could happen
Yeah, we better...
We gotta...
We gotta get her
Any ideas? Yeah
Wait a minute, let's not jump to conclusions
That thing could be keeping us alive
My ass
Where's the fuckin' phone?
Who you gonna call?
Arnold Palmer
What?
Are you trying to screw up my entire day?
I am rid of you, Moony
The shrink is gonna pull you... and you are going to be out of my life for good!
Not crazy?
Anyone who would think that a U.S. Senator would o.d. On crack... has got to be out of his damn mind
No, I don't believe it, either... and besides, if you just had an attack... you shouldn't even be on the telephone
Moon...
Moon, would you calm... just calm down, all ri...
Iook, I will be there
I'm not supposed to take this out of the building
Yeah, I... I remember the night at the Bowl
Moon, don't... don't tell my mother
Listen, hold on
OK, I'll do it, yeah
OK
Oh, and... and, Moon, um...
Someone the name of Crystal called... and Terri said that she should call you at home, OK?
Moon?
It's Crys
Peisha and I are in serious trouble... you understand?
And I need to see you, please
Oh, Jesus
What is it? What did she say?
They know, they're gonna kill her
We're gonna take little Leo to... you know the World House?
It's up past the old swim club...
That used to be Needle Park for the surf set
We'll wait for you there until eight
And after that, I... I don't know what's gonna happen
Tell him about the pictures
You have to bring the pictures... and come alone, Moon
Please, come
I love you
We got forty minutes
Jesus, they got my kid
Call the police
I'd waste forty minutes trying to make 'em believe me
I'll leave Harry a note
Two three nine, code blue, code blue
Two three nine
Grab ten ccs ccs!
I think they responded very well to that
Here
Hemorrhoids
Crude, but funny
Over there
A police car's a little obvious, isn't it?
We got thirty minutes
You wanna take a bus?
You sure you're gonna be OK?
If I'm not, you're gonna be the first to know
The note says he's on his way to Malibu
Excuse me, I'm looking for Jack Moony
Who the hell isn't?
Yes, it's written to a guy named Harry
I'm Harry
You friend's lucky to be walking
How the deuce do you think he's gonna get to the beach?
This is a little bit more excitement than is called for in this situation... don't you think?
He took the car because he needed it
You think he's gonna ask for it?
Look, I don't think you realize just how serious his condition is
I realize it, I realize it
Harry! Harry...
Dillnick, what are you doing here?
Uh, Moon told me to bring
Marquand's autopsy file
Now, I know it's not supposed to leave the precinct...
Son of a bitch!
What's going on here?
Holy shit
What?
They never even checked for drugs
Yeah
No, I'm certain I can arrange something for you on Friday
Time check
Quarter to eight
You OK?
Yeah
Uh, I'm a little fuzzy
Did she ever read to you?
Yeah
Every Sunday morning
The funnies, you know?
Yeah? Yeah
Yeah, me, too
She'd start me out with Doonesbury
Peanuts
Yeah, figures
You should have married her, Moony
Yeah
We both should have
I don't give a damn what Wendt says
Meet me there with a chopper
You think he might suspend us, Harry?
Being a cop is like being a pitcher,
Dillnick
You want your strikes, you gotta risk your balls
It really irritates me when people don't check their answering machines
Well, shoot 'em up
Hold on
Take it easy, take it easy
This'll make you feel a lot better
Come on, we're out of here
Just give her half
Oh, God
You realize this is a setup, don't you?
Yeah
I realize this is a setup
Well, a good lawyer always makes sure his clients are prepared
Yeah
I'm prepared
You OK?
You be the scout I'll be the scout
Hey, Stone
Thanks
Ah, there's nobody here
Shit
Moon?
Sunglasses and an uzi
Watch my back
You OK?
Yeah
Aw, Jesus
This is it
Teller's got Crys and... my son
The right side
Graham's on the left
I'll check the side rooms
Moon, I'm sorry
Hi
The side rooms are empty
I'll watch the door
Ain't love grand?
Cut the shit, I'm here
Now let the girls go
I'll forget about Marquand and deliver the pictures
Moon, there's one coming up behind you
He's got a big gun
That's the plan I had with the girls
Moon?
I don't like to make the same mistake twice
Moon!
Moon!
You're dead, I guarantee it
You're dead, you're dead!
Moon... Moon...
Crys... come on
Crys, come on
You gotta stand up
Come on, pick up the baby!
You gotta stand, pick up the baby
Come on, honey
Moon, Peisha...
Don't worry about Peisha
She's dead
Let me worry about Peisha, come on
You just worry about little Lee
Come on, honey, come on
Fight it, don't give in to it
Come on!
Honey...
Let's get out of here!
OK Lean on me
It's OK
It's OK
It's OK, Lee
Yeah, it's OK, we're going
Yeah, you... you just keep going, honey
Get back! Back!
Now!
Come on, come on, come on
Keep with him, get behind me
Don't look, honey, don't look, come on
Come on, let's get out of here
Get back, get back, another guy
Come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Go this way! This way, Moon!
OK... honey, you gotta get up
You gotta get up!
No, I...
Moon!
Get up!
Come on, get up
Come on, it's only a ten-foot drop
No You gotta jump
Come on, you gotta jump
No Give me the baby
Jump
Come on, over you go
That's it
OK, honey, it's OK, it's OK, come on
Just let yourself down
That's it, that's it!
Don't drop the baby, Moon
I'm not gonna drop the baby
Don't drop the baby
Here's little Lee, here you go, fella
Down you go
All right, he can get down
Take him, take him
Honey, honey!
Tell her to go now
Tell her to go down to the beach
Go down to the beach, honey
Get out of here, go on
Where'd you go?
Hey, Harry, detective Moony's holding his arm
A little funny, isn't he?
Yeah, it must have something to do with his heart condition
