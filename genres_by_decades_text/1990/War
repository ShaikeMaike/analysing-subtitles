Your highness.
Good night, your majesty.
Good night, son.
Father.
Shhh!
Your majesty.
Mother.
# Come live with me and be my love
# And we will all the pleasures prove
# That hills and valleys, dancing feet
# And all the craggy mountains yield
# Come live with me
# And be my love
# There will I make you a bed
# Of roses
# With a thousand

# If these pleasures
# May you move
# Live with me and be my love

# The shepherd swains shall dance and sing
# For your delight...
#... Then live with me and be my love
# Come live with me and be my love
# Come live with me
# And be my love
# And we will all the pleasures prove
# A belt of straw and ivy buds
# With coral clasp and amber studs
# Come live with me
# And be my love
# There will I make you a bed of roses
# With a thousand fragrant posies
# And if these pleasures
# May you move
# Then live with me and be my love
# Come live with me
# And be my love
# If that the world and love were young
# And truth in every shepher飐 tongue
# These pretty pleasures
# Might me move
# To live with you and be your love
# Come live with me and be my love
Now is the winter of our discontent...
...Made glorious summer...
...by this...
...son of York.
And all the clouds that loured upon our house...
...ln the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths...
...Our bruised arms hung up for monuments...
...Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings...
...Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war has smoothed his wrinkled front...
...And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds...
...To fright the souls of fearful adversaries...
...He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber...
...To the lascivious pleasing of a lute!
But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks...
...Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass...
...I that am rudely stamped...
...deformed...
...unfinished...
...sent before my time...
...lnto this breathing world scarce half made up...
...And that so lamely and unfashionable...
...That dogs bark at me as I halt by them...
...Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace...
...Have no delight to pass away the time...
...Unless to spy my shadow in the sun...
...And descant on mine own deformity.
Why, I can smile...
...and murder while I smile...
...And wet my cheeks with artificial tears...
...And frame my face to all occasions.
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover...
...I am determined to prove a villain...
...And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid...
...To set my brothers Clarence and King Edward...
...ln deadly hate the one against the other.
Clarence!
Brother! What means this guard?
His majesty, tendering my person's safety, has appointed...
...This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
What is the matter, Clarence?
May I know?
Yes, Richard, when I know...
...but I must protest, as yet I do not.
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
I漵 not the king who sends you to the Tower.
Elizabeth is queen. Clarence, i漵 she.
We're not safe, brother.
Look, we are not safe.
I beseech your lordships both to pardon me.
His majesty has strictly given me charge...
...That no man shall have private conference with your brother.
We speak no treason.
We say the king is wise and virtuous, and his queen well struck in years!
I beseech you both to pardon me.
We know your charge, Brackenbury, and will obey.
We are the queen's subjects and must obey.
Brother, farewell. I will unto the king.
Meanwhile, this deep disgrace in brotherhood...
...Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
I know it pleases neither of us well.
Your imprisonment shall not be long.
I will deliver you... or else lie for you.
- Meanwhile, have patience.
- Well, I must perforce.
Farewell.
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love you so...
...That I shall shortly send your soul to heaven...
...lf heaven will take the present from my hands!
And now... I'll marry.
What though I killed her husband and his father?
Oh, cursed be the hand that made these holes...
...Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it...
...Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
If ever he have child, abortive be it!
If ever he have wife...
...let her be made more miserable by the life of him...
...Than I am made by my young husban飐 death!
What black magician conjures up this fiend...
...To stop devoted charitable deeds?
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
Foul devil, for Go飐 sake hence and trouble me not...
...For you have made this happy earth my hell!
If you delight to see your heinous deed...
...Behold the pattern of your butchery.
Lady...
...you know no rules of charity.
Villain, you know no law of God nor man.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman...
...Of this supposed crime to give me leave...
...By circumstance but to acquit myself.
Did you not kill my husband?
- I grant you, yes.
- You grant me, hedgehog?
Then God grant me too...
...You may be damned for that wicked deed!
- Gentle Lady Anne...
- He was gentle, mild and virtuous.
The fitter for the King of Heaven who has him.
And you unfit for any place but hell!
One place else, if you will hear me name it.
- Some dungeon!
- Your bedchamber.
Le漵 leave this keen encounter of our wits.
Your beauty, which did haunt me in my sleep...
...Could make me undertake the death of all the world...
...So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
If I thought that, I tell you, homicide...
...I would rend that beauty from my cheeks!
These eyes could not endure that beauty's wreck.
As all the world is cheered by the sun, so I by that.
It is my day... my life!
He who bereft you, lady, of your husband...
...Did it to help you to a better husband.
His better does not breathe upon the earth.
He lives who loves you better than he could.
- Where is he?
- Here.
Why...
...do you spit at me?
Would it were mortal poison for your sake!
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
Never hung poison on a fouler toad!
Out of my sight!
You do infect my eyes!
Those eyes of yours... from mine have drawn salt tears.
Yet, when I heard the story of my father's death...
...And all the standers-by had wet their cheeks...
...Like trees bedashed with rain, in that sad time...
...My manly eyes did scorn a humble tear.
And what that sorrow could not thence exhale...
...Your beauty has...
...and made them blind with weeping.
Teach not your lip such scorn...
...for it was made for kissing, lady...
...not for such contempt.
If your revengeful heart cannot forgive...
...I humbly beg for death...
...upon my knee!
No, do not pause, it was I who killed your husband...
...But it was your heavenly face which set me on.
Take up the blade again...
...or take up me.
I will not be your executioner.
Then bid me kill myself... and I will do it.
I have already.
That was in your rage. Speak it again.
I would I knew your heart.
I fear it is false.
Then never was man true!
Put... down the blade.
But shall I live in hope?
All men, I hope, live so.
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
To take is not to give.
May I, with all expedient duty, see you?
And much it joys me, too,
To see you are become so penitent.
Bid me farewell.
'Tis more than you deserve.
But since you teach me how to flatter you...
...lmagine I have said farewell already.
Was ever woman in this humour wooed?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her...
...but I'll not keep her long!
I who killed her husband and his father...
...To take her in her hear漵 extremest hate...
...With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes...
...And then to win her...
...all the world to nothing? Ha!
Upon my life, she finds...
...- although I cannot - myself to be a marvellous, proper man!
I'll entertain a score or two of tailors...
...To study fashions to adorn my body...
...And then return lamenting to my love!
Shine out, fair sun, till I've bought a glass...
...That I may see my shadow...
...as I pass!
Catesby!
Clarence still breathes.
Edward still lives and reigns.
When they are gone...
...then shall I count my gains.
- (toy gunshot)
- Uhh!
The king is sickly, weak and melancholy.
Have patience, sister.
No doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustomed health.
His physicians fear for him mightily.
If he were dead, what would become of me?
The heavens have blessed you with two goodly sons...
...To be your comforters when he's gone.
Ah, but they're young, and their minority...
...ls put into the trust of
Richard Gloucester...
...A man who loves not me nor you, my brother.
Is it confirmed he will be Lord Protector?
If the king miscarry.
My love...
...what danger can befall to you...
...So long as Edward is your constant friend...
...And a sovereign...
...whom Richard must obey?
Yes, and shall obey...
...and love you, too.
(James) Pow! Pow!
Ratcliffe!
Wha漵 his name?
His name is Tyrell, sir.
I partly know the man.
Is your name Tyrell?
James Tyrell...
...and your most obedient servant.
Are you indeed?
Prove me, my gracious lord.
Oh, I have passed a miserable night.
I thought that I had broken from the Tower...
...And was embarked across to Burgundy...
...And, in my company, my brother Richard...
...Who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches.
As we paced along...
...I thought that Richard stumbled, and in falling...
...Struck me overboard...
...lnto the tumbling billows of the main.
Oh, Lord, I thought what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of water in my ears.
What sights of ugly death within my eyes.
I thought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks...
...A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon...
...Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl...
...lnestimable stones, unvalued jewels...
...All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
Some lay in dead men's skulls...
...and in the holes where eyes did once inhabit...
...there were crept, as it were in scorn of eyes...
...reflecting gems...
...That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep...
...And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.
My dream was lengthened after life.
Oh, then began the tempest to my soul.
With that, I thought a legion of foul fiends...
...environed me...
...and howled in my ears such hideous cries...
...that with the very noise...
I trembling waked...
...and, for a season after, could not believe but that I was in hell!
Such terrible impression made my dream.
Oi! Oi, off!
Now then, my hardy, stout-resolved mates...
Ahh!
Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
We are, my lord, but need the warrant to be admitted to where he is.
Well thought upon!
I have it here about me.
Be sudden in the execution...
...For Clarence is well spoken and perhaps...
...May move your hearts to pity.
We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
I like you, lads.
About your business straight.
Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears.
Clarence has not another day to live.
Which done, God take
King Edward to his mercy...
...And leave the world for me to bustle in!
God make your majesty joyful, as you have been.
(Queen Elizabeth) Prime Minister.
- Lord Stanley.
- Saw you the king today?
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.
- Did you confer with him?
- Ma'am, we did.
He desires to make reconciliation between Richard and your brother.
Would all were well, but that will never be.
I fear our happiness is at the height.
Who is it that complains unto the king...
...That I, in truth, am stern... and love them not?
Because I cannot flatter and look fair...
...Smile in men's faces...
...smooth, deceive and cog...
...I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm?
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
To you, who have neither honesty nor grace!
When have I injured you?
When done you wrong?
Come, come, we know your meaning!
The world is grown so bad...
...That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch!
You envy my advancement and my family.
God grant we never may have need of you.
Meantime, God grants...
...that I have need of you.
My brother is imprisoned by your means.
Richard, you do me shameful injury!
Benedictus, benedicat, per Jesum
Christum, Dominum nostrum. Amen.
(Brackenbury) What would you, fellow, at the Tower...
...And how came you hither?
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
I never did incense his majesty...
...Against your brother, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
- You may deny that you...
- She may, my Lord!
She may, Lord Rivers, but who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that.
She may help you to many great promotions.
My Lord of Gloucester...
...I have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and bitter scoffs!
I had rather be a country serving maid
Than a great queen in this condition...
...To be so baited, scorned and stormed at!
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty!
Tell him... and spare not.
What I have said, I will avouch it in the presence of the king.
Before you were queen...
...yes, or your husband king,
I was a packhorse...
...in his great affairs.
In all that time, you and your brother here...
...were sympathetic to the enemy.
Let me put in your mind, if you forget what you have been before...
...and what you are; indeed what I have been...
...and what I am.
- A bottled spider!
- (Rivers laughs)
My dear brother-in-law...
...in those busy days
When now you try to prove us enemies...
...We followed then Edward, our lawful king.
So should she you, if you should be her king.
If I should be?
I'd rather be a pedlar!
I'm too childish-foolish for this world.
You poisonous, bunch-backed toad!
Have done, have done.
Small joy have I in being this country's queen.
Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog.
Look, when he fawns, he bites.
Your majesty, his majesty has called for you.
What did she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
I cannot blame her...
...by Go飐 holy mother.
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion...
...To pray for those...
...who have done wrong to you.
What, are you afraid?
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it...
...But to be damned for killing him...
...from which no warrant can defend me.
I thought you had been resolute.
So I am. Let him live.
I'll back to Richard Gloucester and tell him so.
No. Wait a little.
Some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
Remember our reward when the dee飐 done.
He dies. I forgot the reward.
- And where's your conscience now?
- In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
In Go飐 name...
...what are you?
A man, as you are.
But not, as I am, royal.
Nor you, as we are, loyal.
Who has sent you to me?
- And why have you come?
- To... To...
...murder me.
Aye.
But how, my friends, have I offended you?
Offended us you have not, but King Edward.
I will send you to my brother Richard,
Who shall reward you better for my life...
...Than will the king for tidings of my death.
You are deceived.
Your brother Richard hates you.
You are wrong.
He loves me and he holds me dear.
Go you to him, tell him and he will weep.
Aye! Millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.
Oh, do not slander him, for he is kind.
- Right... as snow in harvest!
- Richard! No!
(King Edward) So, now we have done a good day's work.
Now, friends, continue this united league.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hands.
Hastings, my soul is purged from grudging hate.
Your majesty, I truly swear the like.
Elizabeth, you are not exempt in this.
Wife, greet Lord Hastings.
Let him kiss your hand.
Dear Hastings.
Now, princely Buckingham... make me happy in this unity.
Whenever Buckingham does turn his hate upon your majesty...
...God punish me with hate from those where I expect most love.
When I most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend...
- Richard!
...treacherous and full of guile is he.
Good morrow to my sovereign king.
- Now, Richard...
- And queen.
I have done a good day's work.
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate.
I漵 death to me to be at enmity;...
...I hate it and desire all good men's love.
First, ma'am,
I do entreat true peace of you...
...Which I shall purchase with my duteous service.
Of you, my noble, dear Lord Buckingham...
...lf ever any grudge were lodged between us.
Of you...
...Lord Hastings.
Of you, dear Rivers...
...Who, all without desert, has frowned on me!
Indeed, of all, I do not know that Englishman alive...
...With whom my soul is any jot at odds...
...More than the infant...
...that is born tonight.
I thank my God for my humility.
I wish to God all strifes were settled so.
My sovereign lord...
...I do beseech your majesty to take your brother Clarence to your grace.
Why, ma'am, have I offered love for this?
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
Who knows not he is dead?
Who knows he is?
(softly) Is Clarence dead?
The order was reversed!
But he, poor man, by your first order died...
...And that a winged Mercury did bear.
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand.
Oh, God...
...I fear... thy justice will take hold of me!
And mine, and mine...
...and yours for this!
Rivers, help me to my bed!
Oh, poor Clarence!
This is the fruits of rashness.
Marked you not, Hastings...
...How that the guilty brother of the queen looked pale...
...when he did hear of Clarence's death?
God will revenge it.
Oh, Clarence...
...Clarence, my unhappy son.
This news is bad indeed.
- What, is he in his bed?
- He is.
Oh, he has over-used his royal person much.
What means this scene of rude impatience?
Edward, my lord...
...your son our king is dead!
Why grow the branches now the root is withered?
Why wither not the leaves, the sap being gone?
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.
On me pour all your tears.
I am your sorrow's nurse.
Elizabeth, have comfort.
We all of us have cause...
...To wail the dimming of our shining star.
Though we have spent our harvest of this king...
...We are to reap the harvest of his son.
Sister, think you like a careful mother of the Prince of Wales, your son.
Send straight for him.
Let him be crowned.
In him your comfort lies.
Me seemeth good that with some little train...
...the prince be brought to London to be crowned.
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
Lest by a multitude, dear sir, the new-healed wound of civil war break out!
I hope the king made peace with all of us...
...And the compact is firm and true in me.
And so in me, and so, I think, in all.
Therefore I say, with noble Buckingham...
...l漵 fitting that so few should meet the prince.
- Prime Minister?
- And so say I.
Then be it so.
Two mirrors of my husban飐 likeness are cracked in pieces...
...by malignant death.
And I for comfort have but one false glass...
...That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Madam?
Mother, I do humbly crave your blessing.
God comfort you...
...and put meekness in your breast...
...Love, charity, obedience and true duty.
Amen.
And make me die a good old man.
Tha漵 the butt-end of a mother's blessing.
I marvel that her grace did leave it out.
My Lord Protector.
My Lord Protector, whoever journeys to the prince...
...For Go飐 sake, let not us two stay at home...
...And let us part Earl Rivers from the prince.
My other self!
Agghh, agghh!
I long with all my heart to see the Prince of Wales.
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
They say my uncle Richard grew so fast...
...That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old!
Oh, go to, you parlous boy!
- You are too shrewd.
- Elizabeth, be not angry with your son.
Pitchers have ears.
Lord Stanley.
Richmond.
What news?
Such news that grieves me to report.
What is your news?
Your brother Rivers is murdered.
By whom?
Richmond?
Richard...
...and Buckingham.
I see the ruin of my family.
Welcome, dear nephew.
(laughs) Welcome to your capital.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
Those uncles who you want are dangerous.
Your highness attended to their sugared words...
...And looked not on the poison of their hearts.
God keep you from them and from such false friends.
God keep me from false friends?
But they were none.
The Prime Minister, Lord Hastings, comes to greet you.
Uncle Richard!
Catesby... is it not an easy matter to make Lord Hastings of our mind...
...For the instalment of this noble duke...
...ln the seat royal of our famous land?
He for the late king's sake so loves the prince...
...That he will not do anything against him.
What think you, then, of Lord Stanley and the Archbishop?
They will do all in all as Hastings does.
Call them tomorrow early to determine of the coronation.
And as it were far off, sound out Lord Hastings...
...and give us notice of his inclination.
Commend me to Hastings.
Tell him, Catesby, that Rivers is let blood.
- Uncle!
- What would you have...
...my little lord?
Because that I am little, like an ape...
...I think that you should bear me on your shoulders!
- Uncle Richard...
- Stanley.
Where shall we stay until our coronation?
If I may counsel you, some day or two...
...For your best health and recreation...
...Your highness shall repose you at the Tower.
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower!
- Why? What should you fear?
- My uncle Clarence's angry ghost.
My grandma told me he was murdered there.
I fear no uncles dead.
Nor none who live, I hope!
So wise so young, they say, do never live long.
Well, let them rest.
My Lord Protector, what shall we do if we perceive...
...Hastings will not yield to our plans?
Chop off his head.
Something we shall determine.
And look when I am king...
...claim you of me the earldom of Hereford...
...and all the movables whereof the king my brother was possessed.
I'll claim that promise of your royal hand.
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
Come, le漵 to supper.
And then?
My uncle dreamt tonight that the boar had shown his tusks.
Therefore he sends to know if you will shun the danger that his soul does fear.
Return to Lord Stanley.
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting substance.
As for his dreams,
I wonder he is so foolish.
Morning, Catesby.
Tell your uncle
I shall see him at the meeting...
...Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.
Catesby, what news in this our tottering state?
It is a reeling world indeed, sir...
...And I believe will never stand upright...
...Till Richard wear the garland of the state.
How "wear the garland"?
Do you mean the Crown?
Yes, my lord.
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders...
...Before I see the Crown so foul misplaced!
Hastings.
Where's your boar spear, Lord Stanley?
Before a fortnight makes me older,
I'll send some packing...
...that yet think not on it.
It is a vile thing to die when men are unprepared and look not for it.
Archbishop! You're early stirring.
I am glad to see you, Prime Minister.
Talking with a priest, Hastings?
Your friend Rivers - he needed the priest!
What is't o'clock?
On the stroke of two.
Now, gentlemen, the cause why we are met...
...ls to determine of the coronation.
Well, speak. When is the royal day?
Are all things ready... for the royal time?
They are.
Who knows the Lord Protector's mind in this?
Your lordship, we think...
...should soonest know his mind.
- We know each other's faces.
For our hearts, he knows no more of mine than I of yours...
...Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
Hastings, you and he are near in love.
I have not sounded him...
...But you, my noble lords, may name the time...
...And on the duke's behalf
I'll give my voice.
Good day to you all.
I've been long a sleeper.
Had you not come upon your cue, my lord...
...William, Lord Hastings, had pronounced your part.
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder.
He knows me well and loves me well.
I pray you all...
...tell me what they deserve who do conspire my death...
...and have prevailed upon my body...
...with their damned witchcraft.
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
Then be your eyes... the witness of their evil.
See how I am bewitched.
Behold...
...my arm is like a blasted sapling...
...withered up by Queen Elizabeth, that monstrous witch!
If she has done this deed, my noble lord... lf?
You protector of this damned Elizabeth!
Talk you to me of "if"?
You are a traitor!
Off with his head!
Now, by Saint Paul, I swear I will not dine until I see the same!
The rest that love me, rise and follow me!
The duke would be at dinner.
He longs to see your head.
So dear I loved the man...
...that I must weep.
Would you imagine that the subtle traitor...
...had plotted in the parliament to murder me...
...and the Lord Protector?
Had he done so?
Lord Mayor, the civil peace...
...enforced us to this execution.
Now, he deserved his death.
And do not doubt...
...But that I shall acquaint my duteous city colleagues...
...With all your just proceedings in this cause.
Buckingham, go after to the Council House.
Infer the bastardy...
...of Edwar飐 children.
Moreover...
...urge Edwar飐 hateful lechery...
...Which stretched unto their servants, daughters, wives!
Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator...
...As if the golden fee for which I plead...
...Were for myself.
Catesby.
Give order that no manner of person...
...Have any time recourse unto the princes.
When scarce the blood was well washed from his hands...
...Which issued from my other angel husband...
When, I say, I looked on
Richar飐 face, this was my wish.
"Be you," I said, "accursed."
"And when you wed, let sorrow haunt your bed."
Within so small a time...
...my woman's heart grossly grew captive to his honey words...
...And proved subject to my own soul's curse.
Buckingham...
...what say the citizens?
Did you infer the bastardy of Edwar飐 children?
I did. And the insatiate greediness of his desires;...
...His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy!
Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace...
...Your bounty, virtue, fair humility.
And when my oratory drew to an end...
...I bade those who did love their country's good...
...Cry "God save King Richard,
Englan飐 royal king!"
- And did they so?
- (hesitates) No.
- So God help me, they spoke not a word.
- Bah!
What tongueless blocks are they!
Would they not speak?
My Lord Mayor and his colleagues have arrived.
Pretend some fear!
Be not easily won by our requests.
And, look you... get a prayer book in your hand.
Play the mai飐 part:
Still answer no and take it.
Ratcliffe.
No doubt we'll bring it to a happy issue.
You shall see what I can do.
Catesby.
He does entreat you, my Lord Buckingham...
...to visit him tomorrow or next day.
He is within... with two right reverend priests.
Tell him myself, the Mayor and these gentlemen...
...Are come to have some conference with him.
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
Ah, Lord Mayor.
Richard is not King Edward.
He is not lulling on a lewd love-bed, but meditating...
...with two deep divines, praying to enrich his watchful soul.
Happy were England, would this virtuous man take on his grace...
...the sovereignty thereof.
God defend Richard should say no to us.
- I fear he will. Catesby?
- He wonders to what end...
...you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him.
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
By heaven, we come to him in perfect love!
My Lord Protector?
Pray pardon us the interruption of your devotions.
My lord, there needs no such apology.
I do suspect I have done some offence.
You have. Will it please you to amend your fault?
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
Know then, it is your fault that you refuse the supreme seat...
...the throne majestical.
We heartily solicit you, take on the kingly government of this your land...
...Not as Lord Protector, but from blood to blood...
...Your right of birth, your empery, your own!
Your love deserves my thanks.
But my desert, unmeritable, shuns your high request.
First, if all obstacles were cut away...
...Yet so much is my poverty of spirit...
...So mighty and so many my defects...
...That I should rather hide me from my greatness.
But, God be thanked, there is no need of me.
The royal tree has left us royal fruit.
You say the Prince of Wales is your brother's son.
So say we... but born before his wedding day.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self...
...This proffered benefit of dignity!
- Good my Lord Protector!
- We entreat you...
(softly) Truly, the hearts of men are full of fear.
I am unfit for state and majesty.
Then we will plant some other on the throne!
I do beseech you, take it not amiss.
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
Your brother's son will never reign our king!
Gentlemen, come, I will entreat no more! Go飐 wounds!
Oh, do not swear, my lord!
Call him again, my lord!
Accept the Crown!
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
Call him again.
(Catesby) My lord! My Lord Buckingham!
I'm not made of stone.
Gentlemen, since you will buckle fortune on my back...
...I must have patience...
...to endure the load.
But God doth know, and you may partly see...
...How far I am...
...from the desire of this.
If you will outstrip death...
...go across the seas and live, dear
Richmond, from the reach of hell!
Go, my dear nephew, from this slaughterhouse.
Long live King Richard!
(chanting) Richard, Richard,
Richard, Richard!
Brackenbury, how are my sons, the princes?
Right well, your majesty.
By your patience,
I may not permit you to visit them.
The king has strictly charged the contrary.
- The king?
- I mean, the Lord Protector.
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
I am their mother!
Who should keep me from them?
I am bound by oath...
...and therefore pardon me.
Go you to Richard... and good angels guard you.
Stay yet.
Look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender princes...
...Whom envy has immured within your walls...
...Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
Rude, ragged nurse, use my babies well.
Now, Buckingham, thus high by your advice...
...and your assistance is King Richard seated.
But shall we wear these glories for a day...
...Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?
Still live they...
...and for ever let them last.
The princes live.
Think now what I would speak.
Say on, your majesty.
Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king.
Why, so you are!
The princes live.
Buckingham, you never used to be so dull. Shall I be plain?
I wish the bastards dead...
...And I would have it suddenly performed.
What say you now?
Speak suddenly. Be brief.
Your majesty may do your pleasure.
Tut, tut!
You are all ice.
Your kindness freezes.
Say have I your consent that they shall die?
Give me some little breath, some pause, your majesty...
...Before I positively speak in this.
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Has he held out so long with me untired...
...And stops he now for breath?
Well!
Be it so.
Lord Stanley!
Your majesty.
Wha漵 the news?
The Archbishop, as I hear...
...Has joined with Richmond in France, your majesty.
Richmond aims to marry young Elizabeth...
...My brother Edwar飐 daughter...
...And, by that knot, he hopes to gain my crown.
Richmond is your nephew.
Well...
...look to it.
- Your majesty.
- Catesby!
Rumour it abroad that Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick.
Look how you dream.
I say again, give out that Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.
Tyrell.
I must be married now to young Elizabeth...
...Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers and then marry her.
Tyrell.
Dare you resolve to kill a friend of mine?
Sir, please you,
I'd rather kill two enemies.
There you have it. Two deep enemies.
Tyrell...
...I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Say it is done and I will love you for it.
It... is... done...
...your majesty.
Your majesty...
...I claim the earldom of Hereford, which you promised I should possess.
Well, let that rest.
The Archbishop has fled to Richmond.
I hear the news.
What says your majesty to my just request?
It was prophesied that Richmond should be king.
A king, perhaps.
- Perhaps.
- Your promise for the earldom.
Riche-monde!
- Your majesty, I...
- Yes!
Wha漵 o'clock?
I am thus bold to put your majesty in mind of what you promised me.
But wha漵 o'clock?
- On the stroke of ten.
- Then let it strike.
Why let it strike?
Because that, like a jack, you keep the stroke...
...Between your begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein today.
Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.
You trouble me! I am not in the vein!
Never yet one hour in his bed...
...Have I enjoyed the golden dew of sleep...
...But have been awoken by his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me...
...And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
Let me think of Hastings and be gone.
Kind Tyrell...
...am I happy in your news?
It is done, your majesty.
(Richard) But did you see them dead...
...and buried?
I did, your majesty.
Gentle Tyrell.
Come to me, Tyrell, soon...
...at after supper...
...When you shall tell the story of their death.
Meanwhile, but think how I may do you good...
...And be inheritor of your desire.
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom...
And Anne...
...my wife, shall bid this world good night.
Uncertain way of gain...
...But I am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Your majesty, on the southern coast there rides a powerful navy.
I漵 thought that Richmond is its admiral.
Buckingham has fled to welcome him ashore.
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
(Duchess of York) Are you my son?
Yes, I thank God, my father and yourself.
(Duchess) You toad!
Where are the princes and your wife?
Mother...
...I have a touch of your condition...
...That cannot brook the accent of reproof.
Oh, let me speak!
Be brief, dear mother, for I am in haste.
A grievous burden was your birth to me!
And came I not at last to comfort you?
You came on earth to make the earth my hell!
Tetchy and wayward was your infancy...
...Your schooldays frightful, desperate, wild and furious...
...Your prime of manhood daring, bold and venturous...
...Your age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly and bloody!
What comfortable hour can you name
That ever graced me with your company?
- If I be so disgracious...
- Oh, hear me a little...
...For I shall never speak to you again!
To war take with you my most grievous curse!
My prayers shall on Richmon飐 party fight.
Bloody you are, bloody will be your end!
Shame serves your life and will your death attend!
I leave for France.
Be not tongue-tied.
You're a dream of what you were... a breath, a queen in jest!
Where is your husband now?
Where is your brother?
Where are your two sons? Wherein joy?
Who sues and kneels and says,
"God save the queen"?
Where are the bended peers that flattered you?
Where be the thronging troops that followed you?
Teach me how to curse my enemy!
Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days.
Think that your babes were sweeter than they were...
...And he that slew them fouler than he is!
Tell me, you villain slave...
...where are my children?
Where is my brother Rivers and your brother Clarence?
Where is Lord Hastings?
Elizabeth...
...I must talk a word with you.
I've no more sons of the royal blood...
...for you to slaughter!
You have a daughter...
...called Elizabeth.
Must she die for this?
Oh... let her live.
Her life is safest only in her birth.
And only in that safety died her brothers.
You speak as if that I had slain the princes.
No doubt the murderer's knife was dull and blunt...
...Till it was sharpened...
...on your stone-hard heart to revel in the entrails of my lambs!
Ma'am, I intend more good to you and yours...
...Than ever you or yours by me were harmed.
Tell me, what state, what dignity, what honour...
...Can you bestow on any child of mine?
Even all I have...
...yes, and myself and all...
...Will I withal endow a child of yours.
Be brief, lest that the process of your kindness...
...Lasts longer telling than your kindness' date.
Know, then, that with my soul
I love your daughter...
...And do intend to make her...
...Queen of England.
What?
You?
What think you of it?
How can you woo her?
Now, that would I learn of you.
- And will you learn of me?
- Madam, with all my heart.
Send to her by the man who slew her brothers...
...A pair of bleeding hearts, then will she weep.
If this inducement move her not...
...Send her a letter of your noble deeds.
Tell her you made away her uncle Clarence, her uncle Rivers...
...yes, and for her sake made quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne!
You mock me, madam, this is not the way...
...To win your daughter.
- There is no other way...
...Unless you could put on some other shape...
...And not be Richard who's done all this!
Say that I did all this for love of her.
Well, then, she cannot choose but hate you.
What is done cannot be now amended.
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons...
...To make amends
I'll give it to your daughter.
Again you shall be mother of a king...
...what?
We have many goodly days to see.
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed...
...Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl.
Go then, my mother, to your daughter go.
Make bold her bashful years with your experience.
Acquaint the princess with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.
And when these troops of mine have chastised...
...The petty rebel Richmond and dull-brained Buckingham...
...Bound with triumphant garlands will I come...
...And lead your daughter to a conqueror's bed.
What were I best to say?
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
To wail the title, as her mother does?
Say I will love her everlastingly.
But how long, fairly, shall her sweet life last?
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
As long as hell and Richard like of it!
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
Oh, no, my reasons are too deep and dead...
...Too deep and dead my infants in their graves!
Harp not on that string, madam, that is past!
Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break!
I know that Richmond aims to wed Elizabeth.
In her consists my happiness... and yours.
Without her follows to myself and you...
...Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul...
...Death, desolation, ruin and decay!
It cannot be avoided but by this.
Be the attorney of my love...
...to her.
Plead...
...what I will be...
...not what I've been.
Shall I be tempted by the devil thus?
Yes, if the devil tempt you to do good.
But you did kill my children.
But in your daughter's womb
I bury them...
...Wherein that nest of spicery...
...they will breed.
Shall I go win my daughter to your will?
And be a happy mother by the deed.
Write to me very shortly...
...And you shall understand from me her mind.
Bear her my true love's kiss.
Farewell.
Relenting fool...
...and shallow, changing woman!
Lord Stanley...
...wha漵 the news with you?
None good, your majesty...
...nor none so bad.
- Hoyday, a riddle!
Neither good nor bad.
Once more, what news?
- Richmond is on the seas.
- Then be the seas on him!
What does he there?
Your majesty, I know not, but by guess...
- Well, as you guess?
- Stirred up by Buckingham...
...He makes for England, here to claim the Crown.
Is the throne empty?
Is the king dead?
You will revolt and fly to him, I fear.
I never was nor never will be false.
Go, then, and muster men...
...but leave behind with us...
...your son, young George.
Stanley, look your heart be firm...
...Or else his hea飐 assurance is but frail.
Your majesty, the Duke of Buckingham...
Till you bring better news!
"The Duke of Buckingham is taken prisoner."
I cry you mercy.
Richmond is landed with a mighty power from France.
Le漵 go to meet him.
While we reason here...
...A royal battle might be won and lost.
Tyrell, give order
Buckingham be brought!
(Richmond) Welcome.
- Brackenbury.
- Richmond.
Fortune and victory be with you, nephew.
The queen has heartily consented that I marry Princess Elizabeth.
England rejoice!
Good Lord Stanley, Brackenbury.
Prepare your advance early in the morning.
On your side I may not be too forward.
Your cousin George is held in custody.
Wretched, bloody and usurping swine!
I do not doubt but his friends will turn to you.
(Stanley) He has no friends.
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
No, my good lord.
Made I him king for this?
Tyrell, why look you so sad?
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks, my lord.
What is't o'clock?
- I漵 supper time, your majesty.
- I'll not sup tonight.
Le漵 consult upon tomorrow's business.
- What is the number of the traitors?
- Six or seven thousand, your majesty.
Our battalion trebles that account.
Besides, the king's name...
...is a tower of strength.
Catesby!
Your majesty.
Send to Lord Stanley.
Bid him bring his force...
...Before sunrising, lest his son George fall...
...lnto the blind cave of eternal night.
Leave me.
I will.
Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Tyrell.
Your majesty.
Leave me, I say.
(Archbishop) Oh, Lord...
...let Richmond and Elizabeth...
...by your fair ordinance...
...be joined together.
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so...
...Enrich the time to come...
...with smooth-faced peace.
Oh, thou whose captain
I account myself...
...Look on my forces with a gracious eye...
...Put in their hands thy bruising arms of wrath...
...That we may praise thee in thy victory.
Sleeping...
...and waking...
...defend me still.
Are you my son? You toad!
Richard, you do me shame!
Bloody will be your end!
(Anne) You do infect my eyes!
(Rivers) I have too long borne your blunt upbraidings!
(James) Because that I am little, like an ape...
...I think that you should bear me on your back!
Where are my children?
I did but dream.
Oh, coward conscience!
What do I fear?
There's none else by.
Richard loves Richard...
...that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here?
No!
Yes... I am.
I love myself, but why?
For any good that I myself have done unto myself?
Oh, no. Alack, I rather hate myself...
...For hateful deeds committed by myself.
I'm a villain.
But I lie, I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well.
Fool, do not flatter.
My conscience has a thousand several tongues...
...Thronged to the bar, crying all, "Guilty! Guilty!"
I shall despair!
There is no creature loves me...
...And if I die...
...no soul will pity me.
Your majesty.
Ratcliffe?
Will all our friends prove true?
- No doubt, your majesty.
- Ratcliffe, I fear... I fear!
Oh, no, your majesty...
...be not afraid of shadows.
How have you slept, my lord?
The sweetest sleep...
...the fairest-boding dreams...
...That ever entered in a drowsy head.
Conscience is but a word that cowards use.
Remember whom you are to cope with...
...all a sort of vagabonds, rascals and runaways.
And who does lead 'em but a paltry fellow, a milksop?
If we be conquered...
...let men conquer us.
Le漵 whip these stragglers over the seas again!
Shall these enjoy our lambs?
Lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters?
What says Lord Stanley?
Will he bring his force?
My lord, he has refused to come to you.
Then off with his son George's head.
Stanley!
Your majesty! Your majesty!
Go!
A horse!
A horse! My kingdom for a horse!
James Tyrell, rescue!
Escape, your majesty, escape!
I'll help you to a horse!
Escape? Slave!
Stop!
Richard!
Richard!
No... no!
Le漵 do it pell-mell.
If not to heaven...
...then hand in hand to hell!

[Shoveling]
[Birds chirping]
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground.
For out of it we was taken.
Dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return.
Heavenly father,
pick this child up on the healing side.
Put the grave behind
for the promise on the other side,
that she might live and abide with you.
Boy as old man:
When sister died,
there weren't none but women and old men to bury her.
All of the able-bodied men
had gone off to fight the Civil War.
I know something about the Civil War.
The story I'm about to tell is true
as best I remember it.
We buried sister in the spring of 1862.
Later that night,
some Yankee bastards dug her up
and tossed her out like a rag doll,
on account of Paps siding with the South.
In these Cumberland mountains
down near the
Tennessee line,
half the folks sided with the South.
The other half sided with the North.
The neighbors turned against their neighbors,
and it was rough through here.
Giddyup.
Whoa.
We heard.
We can bury her again.
Israel can stand guard.
We're gonna take her home.
There'll be hell to pay.
So we brung sister back home to our place
Up at the end of
Meshack Creek.
Ma was mad about things.
She held it in,
And we went on
With the work of feeding ourselves.
[Talking to mule]
[Horses whinny]
Mama!
Man: Whoa!
Mama, men coming.
Yankees.
They'll steal everything we got.
Will they hurt us?
Maybe not.
Go on! Go on!
[Cow bell clanging]
Are you Sarah Anders?
I am.
Ma'am, they say your husband's fighting against his country.
We have orders to resupply
With contraband from the enemy.
That means we'll take forage provisions from you.
We got some hungry boys down in Cumberland Gap.
I apologize for your hardship.
How many you got here with you?
How many?
Me and my boy.
Where is he?
Boy, you go stand by your mother.
Sarah: Come here.
Come here.
Ma'am, I will not hurt you or your boy, if you give us no trouble.
All right.
Take no prisoners.
You got a nice place.
[Gunshot]
I got a piece of bottomland across the River.
Ohio River.
Brown County, Ohio.
Raise hogs, corn, sorghum, mostly.
You should stay there.
[Gunshot]
Ma'am?
Captain?
Uh, there weren't no hams in the smokehouse.
And there's no cows or pigs in the stall.
Just cow shit and pig shit.
Well, see what's in there.
Mmm. Bread.
[Hen clucks]
[Braying]
She don't own nigs.
He work like them.
What you think he is fighting for?
Keep us from stealing his chickens?
That's a good reason.
[Growls]
Shit!
Johnny dog.
[Kiss]
Neely, meet the elephant.
Shit...
That a fresh grave?
I'll tell where our cow is.
Well, I've seen all kinds of hiding places.
[Cowbell clangs]
She's up there.
[Gunshot]
Rodie!
Newt!
Captain?
A cow is up there somewheres.
Neely, Chicago, come on up.
Captain, we take the mule?
Uhh...
No.
Ma'am, I apologize for the things this war makes.
Ugh...
Aah!
Newt!
Oh! Oh, no!
Newt!
I fell off!
I fell off!
I fell off!
Roll him on his side.
Rodie, keep that leg still!
All right, somebody...
Somebody get him something to bite.
Oh, no! No!
Here, Newt, chew on this.
You all ready?
Oh, no!
Let's get him to the house.
[Screaming]
It hurts!
It hurts.
Spin him!
[Newt shrieking]
There's a damn dog under the bed.
Well, I'll kill the sum'bitch!
Captain: Neely, rip up that pillowcase!
Yes, sir.
Ma'am, you got some liniment oil?
No.
You got some whisky?
No.
Well, can you boil water?
Get the turpentine out of the harness shed.
Rodie, get some water.
Neely, light that damn fireplace.
Hold still!
[Men coughing]
What's she got up there?
A ham and a rifle.
Captain?
Man: All right, all right, soldier.
[Vulture screeching]
All right, all right.
Settle down.
It burns, don't it?
Well...
You want a chew?
No.
Look, he's sweating.
We can't move him until the fever breaks.
You can sleep in there if you want to.
I told the men to sleep in the barn.
I'm gonna keep ahold of this musket of yours.
I don't like this at all...
Staying here.
We've got plenty to eat.
Yeah...
Maybe them buzzards will, too.
[Speaking Polish]
Boy: Is he gonna die?
Like Jesse?
If the skinny Yankee gets well... he might be the one shooting at your pap.
You wash your face?
One day... your pap will come around up the creek.
Until then, you're the man around here.
You need to sleep.
Got to bear up.
[Snoring]
Captain?
It's me, Rodie.
Damn, Neely.
Captain, the woman's gone.
The woman's gone?
Mm-hmm.
You should try and get some sleep.
I'll look for her.
Yes, sir.
Elephant...
Elephant.
[Knock knock]
Who's there?
It's me.
Corporal Neely said you was gone.
Am I under arrest?
Who's buried here?
Excuse me for asking.
First Yankee that dies in Altmara,
I'm gonna go down.
And I'm gonna dig up the son of a bitch.
We buried her in Altmara.
The Yankees living down there wouldn't abide that...
Her mixed in with their damn Yankee kin.
Your daughter?
They dug her up.
We brought her back here.
Her pap don't even know.
She smelled so bad.
There'll be hell to pay.
[Sobbing]
[Chicago "introducing" himself to audience in Polish]
Rodie?
Yeah?
Use the damn outhouse.
Sir?
There's a woman about.
Yes, sir.
It burns like hell, don't it?
Damn, it hurts.
Well, it's supposed to, now.
Is that fresh milk?
He can't keep the hard stuff down.
[Newt coughing]
Thank you, ma'am.
[Boy talking to mule]
Whoa, whoa.
Well, the Yankees could steal what we had.
But not what we hadn't got yet.
So I was determined to put in
next year's corn crop.
I was young but I was stout,
and I could handle a mule as well as any man.
Your reins are too tight.
That's why she's drifting.
Whoa, whoa.
You need three fingers of slack right here.
I got a matched pair of sorrel mules back home
That turn on a skinny dollar.
Must be about 10, huh?
That old, huh?
Put some salt in his feed,
And you might get
A couple more crop years out of her.
Come on, come on!
The Yankee captain
asked if he could turn a few rows.
I didn't see the harm in it.
It made my job easier, you see.
And that morning was the first
I seen mama wear her green dress
to the plow field.
Captain:
Hyah! Hyah!
How's Newt?
You ain't been in to see him?
Cain't.
Bad luck.
This is not bad luck.
He is not dead.
It's a gut wound.
Ain't nothing you can do.
What's he doing out there?
Captain:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He is a widower.
He's, um...
Brushing off the cobwebs.
He ain't much of a soldier.
Whoa, whoa.
Thank you, sir.
Where's your husband fighting?
The army of Tennessee.
Was he at Shiloh?
Yeah.
That was a bad mess.
You was there?
No...
No.
No, we never been in a big scrape.
"Meet the elephant," boys call it.
Ma'am, last night,
What you said about your little girl.
I'm real sorry.
Sorry don't do nothing.
Don't stop you from taking our cow or ham,
Killing our chickens.
Well, you have a corn crop.
Some have it worse.
So that's it?
You's out here blistering up your hands
To make you feel better about stealing from us?
If I was you,
I'd take advantage.
These blisters can't hold out much longer.
Captain: Come on.
Ahem.
What?
Hell, Neely, they were starting to smell.
Go ahead. Smell.
You can't leave dead chickens in a rucksack for 2 days!
Corporal!
Uh...
Uh, captain?
Corporal.
Them chickens are starting to smell.
Well, pluck 'em.
Uh, pluck 'em, sir?
How do you do this?
- I ain't.
- I might.
They say you cannot know who does and who don't. It will surprise you.
You ain't running from the elephant, are you?
Me?
Yeah, you.
No.
You get shot a lot easier showing them your backside.
And you know something about this?
I joined up to fight.
No...
No, I ain't running.
Yeah, I know something about it.
Rodie, we ain't soldiers.
We are chicken thieves.
You kiss my brown spot.
I joined up to fight.
My brother saw action.
Wildcat, mule springs, Shiloh.
He said you become a new man, with your first shot.
Dead and dying... hardly get a passing thought.
Become cool and deliberate.
[Gunshots]
[Gunshot]
Captain!
Corporal?
You hear it?
Hear what?
Gunfire.
Whoa, whoa. What?
There was shooting from over there.
Squirrel hunters most likely.
Go ride over and find out.
Ride over?
Might run straight up to an ambush.
I'm in charge.
Neely, only reason you got that stripe is you too bold-ass dumb to think for yourself.
Are you a general?
General, huh?
No, just a captain.
How many men you killed?
You really want to know?
None.
Rodie?
What?
You feel cool and deliberate?
Nothing's moving.
Damn.
We should...
We should bury them.
We'd have to hang around to do that.
You want to hang around?
Hyah!
Want a chew?
Thank you.
[Horses neigh]
Captain.
There was a farm burnt down.
Some old man and his wife were killed.
Where?
There.
No more than 5 Miles up the creek.
You know whose place it is?
Yankees.
Ma'am, they weren't Yankees.
Just some old farmer and his wife.
They sent two boys into the Union army.
They were just farmers.
Like I said, the war was rough through here.
How'd you sleep?
You're going to be fine, soldier.
Uh, how's Newt?
We're out of turpentine.
Captain, what do we do?
Oh...
I don't know.
We need to feed the boys back at the Cumberland Gap.
And that old farmer and his wife.
We should report back that there's some guerrilla outfit running around killing Unionists.
I think we got to wait Newt out.
He's too sick to ride.
We could hitch up the wagon to the mule, haul Newt out.
Giddyup, giddyup.
I won't let that woman and boy root hog or starve.
No. No, sir.
Whoa.
Will you let me do that?
I don't need your help.
Well, I like working with mules.
How's your hands?
Blisters on top of blisters.
Let me see.
Let me see.
All right.
That's fine. Thank you.
Come on!
I told you I got you.
I told you.
Captain, Newt took a poop.
I guess that's a good sign.
Rodie, make sure you clean up this porch.
My stomach hurts.
Worse than yesterday?
Mm-mmm.
Oh, you'll be fine.
You're not as hot.
How's he doing?
He's fine.
I'll make you some sassafras tea.
She's pretty.
You are feeling better.
[Laughing]
[Spits]
Ohh...
Hey, Johnny, I'm sorry.
You crossed my artillery line there.
Here, I'll let you spit back.
Go ahead.
You're scaring the boy.
No, he ain't scared.
Are you, Johnny?
Go ahead...
Spit.
Neely: Rodie, you got a mean streak.
Cool and deliberate.
[Coughing and gagging]
[Wheezing]
Captain?
Neely.
Uh, chicken's cooked.
Yes, yes.
I told you it was going to get burnt.
Pow...
Pow.
Chicago: You are looking rather well this evening.
Leave him alone!
Go to hell.
Chicago: Rodie!
Hey, hey, hey!
Is she crazy, captain?
Bastard!
Rodie hit her dog.
That damn Johnny dog ate my food, captain.
Soldier, I want you to apologize.
I'm telling you, captain, that woman is crazy.
If you want another plate, you'll apologize.
She hit me with a damn bucket!
Common decency tells you you don't pick up a woman and throw her against a wall!
Private, you're dismissed!
Sir!
Hope you get a piece.
What'd you say, soldier?
Rodie, shut up.
Spent your whole damn day, what?
Plowing her corn.
You cut her wood.
I'm sure she thinks you're a damn good samaritan.
You know what I think?
I think you just want a little poke.
Rodie!
Rodie, stop it!
Come on, Rodie!
Rodie!
I hope you kills each other.
You rot in hell.
You rot in hell!
Come here.
Come here.
We can't just sit by.
I want you to go tonight, to preacher's house.
And tell him that there's Yankees here, and he should get word to our people.
Don't talk to anyone but preacher.
And you have to be back before sunup.
- You understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.
These are yours.
Go on.
And I'm sorry.
There was some... ugly things said tonight about...
They weren't true.
No?
Don't think they were true.
Your little girl died, and...
Well, my wife died
3 years ago.
I miss her.
Miss my farm, my boy.
I come here to your place, and it looks a lot like my place...
We ain't gonna be friends.
Let's just keep to being enemies.
Yes, ma'am.
I forgot.
You have a better memory.
Ahem...
Is Newt asleep?
Yeah.
You know,
I don't think Rodie mean to be disrespecting.
His brother was killed by a rebel sniper.
He get crazy thinking about it. He's...
Where are you from?
Chicago.
No, I mean before that.
This small village in Poland.
It's just very small.
You damn foreigner.
Why get mixed up in this?
I think I get to see new places,
I get tired of chopping sausage.
Pretty thin reason to get shot at.
You got a better one?
I've heard your big reasons.
To save the union.
This is what the generals say.
To free the slaves?
Nobody that I know want to get killed to free a bunch of nigs.
It's a mess, ain't it?
Why did you...
Sign up?
Minister.
Brought a runaway slave into our church and ripped off his shirt.
Showed off the ugliest damn strap scars.
Right there from the pulpit, the minister asked for volunteers, and I stood up, and here I am...
Stealing chickens.
Hold on!
Preacher:
Who's there, Israel?
It's Miss Anders' boy.
They came up the creek on horses.
How many Yankees is there?
Which?
One's hurt real bad.
Pharaoh sent his army to smite Israel.
And they drowned in the Red Sea.
It was wrong what they done to your sister.
God's will is a powerful thing.
Mama, mama.
Where's your shoes?
What did preacher say?
What?
That's it's going to be all right.
Is he going to get word to our people?
To your pap?
I think so.
Don't be so thick.
What did he say?
I can't understand him.
Rodie, you can get shot for desertion.
You ain't gonna do it.
What makes you so sure?
Because...
You ain't sure.
You ain't no killer.
They wouldn't send no fighting man
To rob widows and orphans.
You can't even do that.
Rodie?
If you desert...
I'll kill you.
Got to go, captain.
Rodie.
Rodie!
Stop!
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
Shit! A sniper!
God dang it, get down!
Get inside, get inside!
Come on!
Go, go!
What is it?
Newt, keep your head down!
It's a damn sniper.
Is it pap?
I don't know.
Just keep still.
[Gunshots]
Captain: What the hell are you all shooting at?
We can't see the sons of bitches!
It's the elephant.
It is.
It's just a damn sniper.
I believe he's up on that hill.
Anybody here hurt?
You know who's up there?
You know who's out there?
Pap.
[Gunshot]
You need to say something?
You think Rodie's dead?
I don't know.
Captain?
What are we going to do?
You's all as good as dead.
It's time to meet the elephant.
I'll need one of you... to keep a gun on these... Rebs.
And I need the other to cause a faint.
Faint...
What is?
It's a decoy to draw the enemy's fire.
Chicago, I think you better do the decoy.
Here.
Yes, sir, captain.
You shoot them if they try to run for it.
Shoot?
Ready...
Go, go!
Get on!
Get out!
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Speaking Polish]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
Hold it!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What the hell?
Chicago: It's a nig.
Neely: Shooting for the wrong side.
# When the reaping is done #
# And the harvest is o'er #
# At the feet of the son
# We will labor no more
# Serving faithfully...
You killed my boy.
And he killed a federal soldier.
You'll burn in hell for your sins.
Then I guess we'll meet again.
Next time don't send your boy.
Fight your own fights, you rebel bastard.
# When the reaping is done #
We ought to string up that damn rebel preacher.
# And the harvest is o'er #
# At the feet of the son
# We will labor no more
# Serving faithfully
You get that wagon and mule ready.
We're hauling Newt out of here.
# What a Joy it will be
# When the reaping is done #
Hey!
[Speaking Polish]
You can't take our mule.
Oh, get him away from her!
Get him away!
Stop it.
Get him away!
Stop bein' so damn stubborn!
All right?
They're dead!
They're dead!
You son of a bitch!
You hear me?
You stop that!
Boy...
Get away from me!
Boy, you get!
There'll be hell to pay.
Yeah, you said that before.
Go on in there.
Make sure she don't strangle Newt.
Yes, sir, captain.
Hitch up that mule, bring the wagon around.
Yes, sir.
We're getting out of here, Newt.
I'm gonna miss the dog.
Shit...
Ahh!
Sorry, Newt.
Captain, we are ready.
Should we say some words?
You say it for yourself.
Bye, Rodie.
Giddyup!
What do you expect us to eat?
Ma'am.
I says, what do you expect us to eat?
Ma'am, that husband of yours...
Why don't you bring him home?
We'll all eat good.
I'm leaving your rifle.
Maybe the boy can shoot squirrels.
Ma'am, I took your powder.
Let's go.
I thought she was sweet on him.
No, you can't trust johnnies.
Come on, mule.
Whoa, shit!
What the hell happened?
[Gunshots]
I want you both to stay here.
Yes, sir.
What's he doing?
I think he's wanting to kill somebody.
Ohh!
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
I shot.
Shot what?
I heard shooting.
I shot a Yankee.
Do they know it was you?
Do they?
I don't know.
Come on! Come on!
Sarah Anders!
Did you forget something?
Newt was shot about a mile down the creek.
- You know anything about it?
- No.
Where's your boy?
I sent him up the spring.
Boy! Come here!
Your pants are wet.
I was up at the spring.
He was up at the spring.
Come here, boy.
Come here!
Now, did you kill Newt?
You look at him.
Did you kill Newt?
Your mother might tell you that it's all right to kill Yankees.
But I just want you to know that that boy...
He had a brother just like you.
And he had a family just like you!
And he never hurt a fly in his life!
And he wouldn't be dead If you hadn't come down here stealing from us!
We was doing fine until you showed up.
Don't blame it on...
Go ahead...
Kill us.
You know it scares me.
'cause I could.
I really could.
I just hope whoever killed Newt...
Has the common decency to give him a Christian burial.
What'd you do to them?
You heard the shots.
[Thunder rumbles]
Damn...
[Thunder rumbles]
Get that damn Yankee out of our yard.
The captain asked us to do the decent thing.
I don't guess the Civil War was about being decent.
We dug up the big redhead
and floated him down
Meshack Creek.
Ma said he come up that creek to cause trouble,
and we sent him back down where he come from.
We drug the skinny
Yankee up a hill
to a sinkhole.
Where a big sycamore tree had fallen over
and turned up its roots.
We throwed the skinny Yankee in the sinkhole,
throwed some dirt on him.
I don't guess Ma hated the skinny Yankee
as much as the big redhead.
[Thunder rumbles]
Pap never made it back.
That war was a widow-maker.
Ma told me to never never tell anyone
What we had done.
And I don't think I ever did...
Except maybe once, or maybe twice.
[Rain falling]

The French franc keeps dropping, Baron.
Is it yes or no?
We'll soon find out.
This is me.
"A Prisoner of Love".
That's why you changed
"Man's Hope" to "expectations"?
Shit, the cinema!
36 CHARACTERS
IN SEARCH OF HISTORY
Expectations...
That's the word I'd like to write.
Modern life is too fast-paced to allow any room for a feeling so ardent, so tender.
We shrug our shoulders at this chaste betrothal with the future.
Modern man has no time to hope, nor to love.
It's the little people who hope.
Not the modern world.
Like the saints who atone and love for us.
Everywhere in our poor Europe, the tradition of modest expectations is in the hands of the poor.
Like old seamstresses, whose lace work no machine could ever match.
You'll say that these poor fools...
Living on expectations, are no more laudable for hoping than for living.
Probably...
Next!
Mr Vitalis, I'm Baron Felix.
"War is easy. It's..."
So is it yes?
What's your film called?
"The Fatal Bolero".
100,000 francs.
Go on.
1,000,000 francs.
Good thing I'm not serious or I'd think it over for another year.
"War is easy. It's sticking a piece of metal in a piece of flesh."
No, not at all!
Tonight at 10.
I booked a table at Edgar.
We're expecting you.
No, Father! It's not for you anymore.
You have to turn the page!
We'll start over after vacation.
I need to speak to you.
She sent me a letter.
You're lucky.
Yes, but I'm scared.
Too much of her brings me bad luck.
Will you be at your mother's for vacation?
Yes, Uncle.
I'm going to Madrid to get a book.
I'll come to see you before going to Paris.
- How old is it now?
- 35. You should know.
Either you're faithful or you aren't.
Each in his own way.
I was in Spain.
I found Azana's book about how Don Quixote was invented.
I haven't forgotten.
With the communists
I'll go to my death.
But I won't go one step further.
Something's wrong.
Is it her or is it him?
- You'll have to push.
- I'm tired!
I know, I know.
You saw Sollers' article in "Le Monde",
"Sarajevo and Marivaux".
Let's go by foot. It's not far.
She's given him the idea of going to Sarajevo to put on
"The Game of Love and Chance".
As if France needed that!
That screwy philosophizing daughter of yours!
He says he'll find a sponsor, if I lend him the car.
Can you imagine?
The car in which Albert Camus got killed drives on to Sarajevo.
I may have Corneille or Racine.
We said no tragedies!
How about Musset?
- "One Mustn't Play at Love"
- In Sarajevo.
I heard Musset was mean to George Sand.
Serves her right.
And what's more, Camille... that's me!
Happiness is such a rare pearl in this earthly ocean.
I know her. Three years ago, she wanted to deliver Jerusalem.
In the meantime, she's unemployed.
In Madrid, candles are forbidden in every church.
- What do they use?
- Electricity.
Good God.
- I agree.
- I don't.
"We begin by defending a Republic and end up robbing stagecoaches": Hugo.
I don't like guerillas, that ass Guevara, 2 or 3 Vietnams...
Yeah, Dad. 2 or 3 Americas.
Kings lunch, princes dine, paupers sup.
That's right.
So, who starts?
I, Albert Camus' granddaughter, decide to put on
"One Mustn't Play at Love" in Sarajevo.
It's suicide.
"Suicide is the only serious philosophical problem."
"The Rebel", page one.
To do so, I've asked the help and support of my cousin, here present.
Children were once parental property.
Yes, but when children are grand, they belong to their grandparents.
Say something.
No, he'll take his $100,000 for the "Fatal Bolero".
Ridiculous!
Shameful!
How horrible.
I have their word.
We'll never see that money.
This is what Juan Goytisolo told me in Madrid:
Is the history of Europe in the 1990's a simple rehearsal with slight symphonic variations of the cowardice and chaos of the 1930's?
Austria, Ethiopia,
Spain, Czechoslovakia: a dreadful, unending Bolero by Ravel.
Anyway, the war is over.
So what?
It was a civil war!
What you're saying is irrelevant!
Anyway, he's right.
What about the forests?
The fish? The wolves?
What's she talking about?
You heard me.
They'll rebuild it any which way.
No use voting green.
I'd like to go away.
With them.
It's not good enough here?
No, I'm not happy.
She can be Rosette.
There's nothing more to say.
Yes, there's more.
Now that I'm unemployed, during these slow, empty hours, a sadness rises into my mind from the depths of my soul.
Bitterness that everything is a sensation belonging only to me and also something outside me.
Something I'm incapable of changing!
Alas, life's a nightmare bad enough.
Leave our dreams out of it.
Articulate!
Yes, Uncle.
How often do my own dreams rise before me?
They represent what's most intelligent in the young generation, in this Europe, not purified, but corrupted by suffering...
To tell me how they resemble reality.
Not exalted, but humiliated by its new-won freedom.
...because I refuse them and they appear suddenly from the exterior.
You too, nothing but youth for sale.
Who's the father of characters in a play?
It was your idea to do theater there...
It's the author, Dad.
And who is the mother?
The actor.
Come with us... please.
I have to stop by Paris.
Listen to my idea.
Remember Hemingway's house?
My Lord,
I come to ask a favor of you.
The villagers to whom I spoke say you love your cousin and that you wooed me as a kind of joke.
You'll need some money.
I've saved up.
Like that?
Alas... let's go!
What were you talking about?
Do you mind telling me?
We were talking about our country.
He lives in Prague now.
His family was killed.
We were talking about death and about how you feel.
When it hits you?
Yes.
It's not like in books.
They use nice sentences, but it's not like that.
I told him what happens.
He agreed.
You don't feel anything, but you say something.
What?
Once I was run over by a police car.
There was an explosion. I fell.
I was lying on the sidewalk in a daze.
But I didn't think of dying.
There is no death.
There's only... me... who is going to die.
We're expecting you !
No, we're staying here.
Don't be stupid. It's cold.
No, we're staying here.
- At least come eat.
- We'll manage.
I'll be back later.
A room with a view.
Let's get to work.
What did he want?
What an ass.
Let's get to work.
Kings lunch, princes dine, paupers sup.
Not like that.
Words are words and kisses are kisses.
I realize I have little wit as soon as I open my mouth.
Let's get to work.
Tonight, philosophy.
Say something.
I think, therefore I am.
In "I think therefore I am," the "I" of "I think" is not the same as the "I" of "I am". Why?
The relation between body and spirit has yet to be shown.
Between thought and existence.
It's not funny.
I bit my tongue.
The sensation of I have of existence is not yet a "me".
It's an unreflected sensation.
It's born within me, but... without "me".
What are you up to?
Nothing, Uncle.
Is everything okay?
We're not tourists, Dad.
I'm asking because people are unhappier than we think.
And after all, there's no such thing as grown-ups.
What are you thinking?
I was wondering why I'm here... and what it means to be here.
Do you regret having come?
No.
Why do we ask such questions?
Why do we ask whether we exist or not?
I'm alive and I'm here.
Why is it dark at night?
Maybe the universe was once young like you.
And the sky was all ablaze.
As the world grew older, it grew farther away.
When I look at the sky through the stars,
I only see what has disappeared.
Tomorrow, Sheherazade.
I brought you a book.
A law of what?
There's a law of compensation.
Like with banks?
Balance, if you prefer.
Come on... for France.
Still no news?
A postcard.
It's three weeks old.
Justice always prevails. lf you have a wife and children, you can't write Hamlet.
I thought Shakespeare was married.
You've never read him! I have.
He missed out on some good stuff.
Defeat of intelligence.
What now?
I'm giving up. I'm tired.
Is Sarajevo far?
Just think...
That's all I do.
"I am but a living stage on which various actors do various plays."
Fernando Pessoa.
Yes. Remember his outline for Faust?
Act 1 :
War of intelligence against itself.
Act 2:
War of intelligence.
It's the Minister of War.
Of Defense, Sarah.
How's your book?
It's coming along,
Mr Minister of Defense... but not of the State!
Of the Republic!
Act 4:
War of intelligence against action.
Act 5:
Defeat of intelligence.
I see.
Very few people can see.
I hear, then !
Let's go.
Just another 300 kilometers.
One more cigarette.
Shit, he left!
Vichy wasn't the Republic.
But was the Revolution?
And its soldiers?
It helps to use the right words.
Harry, books are crimes.
"And as long as there are hacks
"who scribble away,
"there will be scoundrels
"out to kill."
Victor Hugo.
Your children are in Yugoslavia, right?
Her son and his cousin.
- What for?
- To put on Musset in Sarajevo.
With 17 empty theaters in Paris!
Are the poor kids having fun?
What do they hope to find?
A taste of freedom we're lacking here.
"Freedom? What for?"
You understand, this is France here.
There, it's America.
She's scared.
Remember those pilots.
We know they were tortured.
Tell her France will help if necessary.
I see a house!
What is she saying?
I can't hear!
She said:
"The poor will save the world."
Like us... poor asses.
They'll do it despite themselves.
Just try. Fight.
I saw a house. We're safe.
They'll do it despite themselves.
They'll ask for nothing in exchange.
They don't know the price of services rendered.
They'll accomplish this immense task.
Across the street, the Vietnamese made Kissinger yield.
The peace talks.
Nation against State.
You know what de Gaulle said of the French?
"They live in France.
France lives in me."
You owe me a favor.
I'll do what I can.
At this table, 40 years ago,
Rosselini finished "Pulcinella".
France won't help.
You say you love me.
And you never lie?
Never.
Yet this maiden has told me that you do.
What will you say to her,
Perdican, when she holds your words against you?
What did I do to make you cry?
I understand Alfred de Musset.
But all her talk about philosophy...
What's that?
Almost nothing or... something I don't know.
Something between the two.
Who is it?
What do you think?
What are we responsible for?
For what we do and for what we let happen when we can prevent it.
One's active and the other's passive.
Yes, of unequal importance.
Letting children starve to death, as we've done in Africa and elsewhere, is nothing to be proud about.
But killing one child is something else, something worse.
In the first case, you're responsible by default.
In the second, you're responsible by excess.
An excess of violence, of hatred.
Isn't an excess of evil worse than an absence of good?
Okay, once again :
One is never totally innocent of what one can prevent, but one is totally guilty only of what one does.
Is he still in love with you?
That's his problem.
I hope he isn't.
It's up to you.
"Philosophy is almost nothing," he told me.
"Or... something I don't know."
I see.
You need to have faith.
Like in Islam, or with your Christ.
No, that's not philosophy at all.
Let's get going.
I'm with the Red Cross.
Meet my secretary.
They speak every language here.
The International Brigade?
No, international brigands.
Where did we leave off?
Let's discuss the prisoners.
There are no more prisoners.
Their cigarettes are here.
The hostages, if you prefer.
France wants to know, Miss.
You know my name?
We saw you on CNN last week.
That's nice.
I'm bored. What can I do?
Go shoot your load.
How about the bank?
The hostages, please.
We need to interrogate them.
Laws are laws, even in wartime, Commandant.
He's a General!
What's the writing on the wall?
It's Cyrillic.
What does it mean?
Sarajevo, whore of the Occident.
Can we see them?
Overseas Geneva Bank Ltd.
It's time to work.
I'll be right back.
- I lose.
- Stand there.
Yes, sir.
Honor to Kasparov.
Lower your eyes.
Why are you laughing?
What did you say?
I said you look like Danton.
I told you so.
History professor?
No, philosophy.
Same thing.
Have you read Michelet?
Yes, sir.
Do you remember his description of the Committee of Public Safety?
I don't remember that.
They were third-rate writers and failed actors.
No one had slept for 3 weeks.
Everyone was crying.
Danton wasn't part of the Committee.
Articulate!
Danton wasn't in it.
He was Minister of Justice.
Turn around.
Bend over.
Lift up your shirts.
You too, Miss.
Oh, what we take up the ass!
Your grandfather?
He's your brother?
They're your sisters?
How about them?
What will it be?
Philosophy will be our girlfriend.
Forever.
Day and night.
Even if she loses her name.
Even in her absence.
A clandestine friend.
We respect what prevents us from getting close to her...
As we sense that we're not awake...
And that which is wakeful in us, even in our sleep, is due to her difficult friendship.
Farewell, Perdican.
I said to wear a skirt!
Yes, Dad.
Cinema replaces our gaze with a world in harmony with our desires.
Water! Only water!
No, it's no good.
Since I'm in the movies, all I do is wait!
I'm half an f-stop off.
He's the new runner, sir.
I'm asking what this is!
The location, sir.
What are you eyeing, asshole?
Nothing, ma'am.
A pack of Marlboros.
Yes, ma'am.
Stay here!
I'm studying cinema in high school.
Give him a script.
Go have a seat.
The poster.
It'll cost a fortune.
There's money in the sea.
The Hakim brothers taught me that.
What we need is a casino nearby and a school for Solange.
No problem.
Give me the figures.
- What is this?
- The location.
It's not natural.
Get something else.
Seriously... what's the problem?
Everything. There's not enough water.
It's all wrong.
I was told to keep expenses down.
Let's go.
I'll call the production office.
Don't forget the paychecks.
Who will the actress be?
We'll tell you later.
Here are the pictures.
They're all cows.
What do you think?
Why do cows always look so grumpy? lf your breasts were yanked on four times a day and you only got fucked once a year, you'd look grumpy too.
Have you read it?
Yes. In my opinion...
We don't want it!
I don't care about the story!
The title should be "Fatal Bolero" and the girl should die in a twister!
Yes, sir.
This must be why I've always felt a profound sadness in the cinema.
Both a possibility of expression and the trace of something essential, renounced.
Butt-fuck me, bastard.
Shove your cock up the bitch's ass.
Slide your dick up her butt.
Stick your prick...
Place your bets.
-So what's the news?
-Some good, some bad.
I'll be right back.
I found cheap actors.
He's here. He wants money.
Who are these people asking for money?
What have they done?
None of them has ever sent me a nice letter.
I'll sign two more, then it's over!
We still need... some cash, sir!
Show me that.
Place your bets.
Go sit down.
Did I spell it right?
No!
Place your bets.
Number 36, Baron...
You think so?
Like the Popular Front?
Exactly. Paid vacations.
Long live vacations!
Do your homework!
Number 36.
36, red, even, passe.
Godammit, piss up my crack, piss up my bung hole!
Give me a raise, Baron.
Butt-fuck me to death !
We found cheap actors.
Go away!
I need cash, sir!
See if they're still breathing.
You're crazy.
How horrible!
Not at all. Didn't Cocteau say:
"The cinema..."
That's right.
There's a woman in here.
A man in here.
We'll meet at the hotel.
Knowledge of the possibility of representation consoles us for being enslaved to life.
Knowledge of life consoles us for the fact that representation is but shadow.
No film stock.
- Since when?
- 3 weeks.
I'm half an f-stop off.
I'll take care of it.
We're not tourists.
Why "Fatal"?
There's no use. I can't.
Let's start over, Miss.
It's too hard.
It's because you're acting.
Acting weakens the text.
Acting removes its presence.
It sucks the blood out of it.
You've received money.
It's time to work.
When will you shoot the battle?
There is no battle.
The script!
How about page 121?
Ah yes... you're right.
There... It's done.
Lesson 32.
John Ford. Henry Fonda.
"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon".
I have an idea.
He has an idea!
Don't you care that I love you?
See you tomorrow.
- Can I come in?
- What for?
So I can teach you the rest.
- You're harsh.
- That's how I feel.
Because you've never suffered.
I've made mistakes... but I've loved.
I don't understand the "Fatal".
Can I ask him?
He won't answer you.
In a novel, a house or a person gets all its signification its very existence, from the writer.
Here, a house or a person gets a small amount of its meaning from me.
It's true signification is much larger. It's gigantic.
It is to exist here and now, like you and me, like no imagined character can exist.
Its immense weight, its mystery and its dignity arise from this fact.
The fact that I exist, me too, not like in a work of fiction, but as a human being.
Yes, Dad.
I knew it'd end like this.
Not knowing where to put the camera.
What do we do?
Put the camera in front of the actors.
Rolling!
"Bolero Fatal", 52.
Yes, there's more.
Now that I'm unemployed, during these slow, empty hours there rises from the depths of my soul and... into my mind, a sadness.
2.8 minus 1/4.
Yes, Dad!
We'll make it easier.
Just say the "Yes" at the beginning.
Yes... sir.
Perfect. That will do.
We weren't rolling.
We're reloading.
We have time.
What's the problem now?
I prefer to die.
Whenever you're ready, Miss.
I'm going to lunch.
I'm staying.
How horrible.
It's what I like in cinema.
A saturation of glorious signs, bathing in the light of their absent explanation.
I'm cold!
Fight, Miss.
I am fighting.
Let's go.
Okay.
You're better already.
Yes.
Okay, cut!
The sound's okay!
The camera too!
My master once said:
"I conceive of nothing as infinite.
"How can I conceive of anything as infinite?"
"Listen," I said.
"Imagine a space,
"and that beyond this space is more space,
"and farther on, there's more and more.
"It's never-ending."
"Why," asked my master?
I was stupefied.
"lf it ends," I shouted,
"what's beyond it?"
"lf it ends, beyond it is nothing," he answered.
My master was the only philosopher who was truly sincere.
What's going on?
We're ruined, honey.
They ran off with the money.
Where to?
Now I'll have to work.
No, we have the negative.
What's that for?
We'll make prints and open the movie fast.
It's in black and white!
No, it's in color.
Dumb bitch, it's black and white! lf it's poetry, I'll walk out.
We pay enough taxes as it is.
Look, we'll be able to buy your Omega.
Not an Omega.
I'm not in the Olympics.
Whatever you want!
Judging by that...
I'll end up with a Swatch.
Is your husband here?
It's Mr Felix!
Quiet. Keep working.
Does it start soon? lf it doesn't, I'm leaving.
It's in black and white.
I hope it's not poetry.
It looks like a winner!
Why "Fatal"?
It's the name of a war.
We lost many friends.
Your fucking movie is full of corpses?
- Not exactly.
- The cinema is all about waiting!
Shut up!
Sorry, kid. There are no tits!
Miss, you'll see.
What's the movie about?
The photography is gorgeous, you'll see, Miss.
Are there any boobs?
- No, no boobs.
- Any knockers?
Your grandmother used that word.
No knockers!
Get lost, dickwad!
Get that asshole out of here!
Beat it, little prick!
Let's go see "Terminator 4".
Come back, friends! Come back!
We'll change the movie!
Where's the mistake?
Mother and I told you, you have to turn the page.
Justice prevails.
I knew it.
Try it as a farewell to the tutti and an invitation to the solo.
It's another world.
Built up from nothing, then come back to nothing.
Let's begin.
Yes, Governor.
I prefer Wagner.
Not Wagner!
You'd hear him at the bottom of the sea!
Whereas Mozart...
It's gentle and light.
That's what people think.
Let's begin.
Yes, Governor.
Too many notes in Mozart.
That's what people think.
Some people hear their own inner voices...
with great clearness...
and they live by what they hear.
Such people become crazy...
or they become legends.
Tristan Ludlow was born in the Moon of the Falling Leaves.
It was a terrible winter.
His mother almost died bringing him into this world.
His father, the Colonel, brought him to me.
I wrapped him in a bear skin and held him all that night.
As he grew into a man...
I taught him the great joy of the kill...
when the hunter cuts out its warm heart
and hold sit in his hands...
setting its spirit free.
Colonel Ludlow had three sons...
but Tristan was his favorite.
I had had sons too.
But they were gone now...
forever.
It was a very bad time.
The Colonel had tried to help the People...
but it was no use.
So he decided to go his own way.
He wanted to lose the madness over the mountains, he said...
and begin again.
"Lose the madness", he said.
And so we lived for many years...
and the boys grew strong.
Alfred was the older brother...
old even for his years.
Samuel was the youngest.
There was nothing these brothers would not do for him.
They watched over him like a treasure.
One year--
I am an old man and cannot remember the year.
But it was the Moon of the Red Grass...
when Isabel Ludlow, their mother...
went away for the winter.
She said the winters were too cruel for her.
She said she was afraid of the bears.
She was a strange woman anyway.
That spring, though, she did not return.
And, after that, she did not come much to see us.
Alfred wrote her many letters...
but Tristan refused to speak of her.
His world was here with me.
Every warrior hopes a good death will find him...
but Tristan couldn't wait.
He went looking for his.
Tristan!
Here.
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir.
- Can you breathe?
- Yes.
Move your hand.
Take it away.
You're a stupid, half-brained jackass.
- Yes, sir.
- One Stab put you up to this?
You deserve to be dead.
God knows how you've lived so long.
It'll be all right, son.
I have these letters...
many letters.
Read them.
They are from all of them.
Ludlow...
Isabel...
Samuel...
the whole family...
the whole story.
It is all written here.
April 13, 1913.
Dear Isabel:
I am not fool enough to try to reorder a life already lived...
but I fear I have not done well raising our sons alone in this wild place.
What did I know of children?
I was trained to lead men.
This is infinitely harder.
Dear William:
You take too much responsibility on yourself, as always.
Our sons are finding their own paths.
They are willful, certainly, but then...
who are you and I to complain of willfulness?
As for Samuel, I have big news.
At a Harvard tea for Amy Lowell...
he met and instantly loved
Miss Susannah Finncannon.
I know it will surprise you greatly...
but they are engaged.
He will bring her to Montana this summer to meet his brothers...
and you.
So, William, please behave yourself...
and be as charming as only you can be.
There he is.
- How the hell are you?
- Good. And you?
- Samuel. Good to see you, boy.
- Father, how are you?
- Good to see you.
- Hello.
This is my fiancee, Susannah.
- Hello.
- Miss Finncannon.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.
- This is Alfred.
- How do you do?
- Here's your dog, miss.
- Thank you.
- It's a horse.
- That's a strange-looking animal.
This is Finn.
He's a champion.
You like exotic-looking dogs then,
Miss Finncannon?
Very much, Mr. Ludlow.
- Please call me Susannah.
- All right.
- He's just plain old Alfred.
- Shut up.
- Where's Tristan?
- He's off somewhere. You know him.
He'll welcome you home tonight or I'll know the reason why.
Miss Finncannon, please.
Did you have a good journey?
She is such a lovely creature.
But I fear the loss of her parents...
has given her a certain fragility.
I think she feels very alone in the world.
But she has found a new family now, hasn't she?
The German military is ready to use chaos in Croatia... to justify actions that could plunge the entire civilized world into--
The word "civilized" has no place in discussing the affairs of this world.
Mother told us of your sympathy for the social reformers.
You make it sound like a disease.
No, I'm in agreement.
You mother told me all about One Stab.
She says he was a great warrior.
Yes.
He has a bag of scalps to prove it.
But don't worry.
He's devoted to Father now.
Rather, they're devoted to each other.
Can he speak English?
Stab, speak English?
He wouldn't lower himself to speak English.
But watch out because he understands it perfectly well.
There's Tristan.
- Don't they feed you?
- Not much.
- You smell.
- Miss me, did you?
- Still hung over?
- Still drunk.
Isn't she amazing?
So this is Tristan.
And does he speak English?
For God's sake.
Miss Finncannon, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I hope you and Ugly here... find every happiness together.
Don't mind my brother. 
Your dog has more breeding than he has.
This is Mother's room.
It's lovely.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Pet.
- And you, miss.
Thank you.
- Which one?
- It's this one.
Angelica Susannah.
Hello.
You must be Isabel Two.
I've already met your mother and father.
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.
When I was 13, I was sent away... to boarding school.
I hated it.
May I help you?
You're marrying Samuel.
That's right, I am.
I'm marrying Tristan.
We'll be sisters.
I see you two have met.
Isabel Two is letting me help.
Would you like a rest?
You must be exhausted.
No, not at all.
This is so refreshing... all this grandeur, this unexpected... gift from God.
It doesn't seem like much of a gift in a hard winter, I assure you.
Where's Samuel?
Inside. I could tell your father wanted him all to himself.
- You're very generous.
- No, just happy.
Stop mooning over her and come in here.
Samuel wants to know about the calves from Cheyenne.
Get in here.
Please excuse my father.
It makes him feel young and powerful to treat us like we're idiot children.
For all His countless blessings, may God's holy name be praised. Amen.
Tell Father what you were saying about Vienna.
- What's that?
- It's the Kaiser.
He won't stop them from annihilating Serbia.
Let's not talk about war, please.
Susannah hears that England's mobilizing.
We're stuck out here while all this is going on.
- Thank God.
- You wouldn't want us to evade a duty.
- Wouldn't I?
- Father, with respect--
Please excuse me for being late.
I packed so carefully,
I couldn't find anything.
Thank you.
Would you like some--
As evening fell a maiden stood
At the edge of a wood
In her hands lay the reins
Of a stallion
And n'er I'd seen
A girl as fair
Heard a gentler voice any where
Whispered, alas
She belonged
Belonged to another
Another, forever
Yes, she belonged to
The twilight and mist
Dear Isabel:
How strange to have a cultivated woman in the house again...
and how intoxicating.
To have all three of my sons under my roof again...
fills me with such a deep, quiet satisfaction...
that I thank God.
There's a friend of yours.
A dollar says he brings her back.
Whoa.
Easy.
You got it.
Nice work.
You all look like ice cream cones.
I know you would have.
Ready. Here we go.
Go easy on him, Susannah.
Alfred, you take over.
I must talk to Tristan.
You've disgraced the Colonel's name.
- Nice shiner.
- I hit her back.
She's got me spinning.
I'll bet.
She's got these ideas and theories, and she's so--
What?
Nothing.
How'd you break the mare?
She's what?
She's sort of passionate.
- She a virgin?
- Good Lord, Tristan.
- You brought it up.
- Of course she is.
Are you?
- Yes, I am.
- Going to wait till you're married?
See, she says--
Susannah thinks that--
We won't wait.
And you're afraid you won't meet her expectations?
I guess I am.
Sort of. I don't know.
Should I be?
Samuel, God bless you.
You are good at everything you try.
I'm sure it will be the same with fucking.
Tristan, really.
- She's my future wife.
- You're not going to fuck her?
I'm planning to be with her.
I recommend fucking.
- You're impossible.
- You brought it up.
My point!
Good morning, Colonel Ludlow.
Tristan's hunting.
He didn't do it.
You don't have to worry about Tristan.
Meet John T. and James O'Banion.
They own the mercantile store.
- Morning, James, John T., Sheriff.
- Morning, Alfred.
We're looking for a man we heard might be in this part of the country.
Name is Tom Cullen.
Here's a likeness.
What did he do?
Do you recognize him?
- Yeah, I recognize him.
- We got him.
This fellow passed by here... maybe four or five years ago.
Did some work here on his way to San Francisco.
He hoped to book passage to Australia.
Or Hong Kong.
I can't remember.
- Can you remember?
- Hong Kong.
- What is he wanted for?
- He--
That would be of a private nature.
"Private nature"?
You hold a public office, Sheriff.
Gentlemen.
"There came a low hiss, a horrid sound... that made Rikki Tikki Tavi jump back two clear feet.
And then out of the grass... rose up the head and spread hood of Nag... the big black cobra."
I can read another story.
The Germans broke through at Armentieres.
The British are trapped in the Belgian low lands.
- This paper is a week old!
- Calm down.
With my fluent German,
I could become an officer.
And lead other boys to the slaughter and be slaughtered yourself.
The men who served under you worshipped you.
They were all damn fools.
This is a turning point in history.
- How can we--
- What?
How can we not be part of this?
- You taught us--
- To think for yourselves.
- And to defend what's ours.
- Yes, what is ours!
We've already lost two cousins.
Don't talk at me as though
I've never seen a war!
Not a war like this.
They said that about the war of secession and the Indian wars.
They say it to sell newspapers.
These are not the Indian wars.
We're fighting against naked aggression!
There will be no more talk of wars in this house! Damn it!
I'm sorry, Susannah.
I'm going to Canada to enlist.
I'm going with him.
I'm sorry, my love.
I meant to tell you tonight.
I know you'll understand.
It's the only honorable thing to do.
What's that?
It's a book my father wrote... to try to convince the government to alter their policies... towards the Indians in the Dakotas.
Samuel won't change his mind.
Change it for him.
What happened between them?
Father says she never liked it here.
I think they loved mostly the idea of each other.
Don't let him go.
I'll take care of him.
October 14, 1914.
My dear Isabel:
Today our sons are leaving home...
to defend an England they have never seen.
I am unable to stop them.
I have tried to shelter our sons from all the madness...
and now they go to seek it.
Be careful.
You don't have to go.
Good-bye.
Don't worry, Father.
Take care.
I'll bring you the Kaiser's helmet.
Bring yourself back.
That would please me more.
Yes, sir.
- Take care of Samuel.
- I will.
Colonel Ludlow told me:
"Ride with them to Calgary.
Bring back the horses."
"Damn fools", he called them.
The Colonel would not have his sons...
ride off to war on old nags...
damn fools or not.
Let's join them.
Bring your plate.
He'll be back.
May we join you?
Sit down. 
Feeling lonely in there.
Sit here.
What's her name, Two?
Lady. Tristan's Lady.
In the story, Tristan's lady was Isolde.
- Do you know who Isolde was?
- No.
Your daughter needs an education.
She can read and write, Colonel.
School might be awkward for her.
- I'll teach her myself.
- May I help?
Yeah. I'll teach her history and mathematics.
With your permission, Decker, and yours, Pet.
What do you think?
What will she do with all this education?
She'll live a richer, fuller life, of course.
She's a half-breed.
Not in this house.
- Tristan calls me a half-breed.
- He does?
He says I'm half-gopher and half-hawk.
- After her chores.
- Yeah.
- To us all.
- To you, sir.
- And you, miss.
- And to the boys.
Get back to your unit.
Those boys are boring.
I'd rather have you watching my back.
Go, mate.
February 3, 1915.
Dear Susannah:
The horror of this place is indescribable.
Nothing is as I thought it would be.
Keep your distance!
Keep your spacing!
Tonight, as I prayed for the souls of those who died so terribly...
yet so bravely...
I admit that I also prayed for personal glory.
Is that wrong to want to distinguish myself gloriously...
in combat as my father did?
Tristan and Alfred watch over me so carefully...
I may never get the opportunity.
Charge!
Goddamn it!
- Where are you hit?
- It's just a scratch.
Susannah, I see now...
not that my father was right, but that I was naive.
- Let me up, damn it!
- Stay down!
Fall back!
Still, we place our bodies in God's keeping.
We go into battle honorably...
full of confidence...
with His name on our lips.
- We're pinned here.
- We'll wait.
- Give him a hand.
- Help him down.
Goddamn.
Susannah:
I try to guard against despair...
but there are moments when it seems that all human decency is broken down.
Alfred will recover from his wounds...
but he and Tristan seem to have drifted apart, or worse.
I cannot understand it.
I miss you more than you can imagine.
You are all that is clean and cool and pure.
I close my eyes and think of you.
I now regret that we listened to everyone and waited to marry.
Even more, I regret that I left before we could be together...
as we planned, my beloved.
Please stay on at the ranch and wait for me.
Don't let Father worry.
I know God's mercy will protect me...
aided considerably by Tristan...
who seems to be in France less to fight the Germans...
than to act as my nursemaid.
Be well, my love.
Your own, Samuel.
Captain needs me to translate this before tonight's reconnaissance.
- Alfred will want to see you.
- I'll be there.
- Yeah?
- Go on.
Where's Samuel?
He's translating.
He'll be here.
Boy, that's a good one.
- Vino?
- Put that away.
- They said you'll get a medal.
- Yes.
- They're sending me home.
- I'm glad for you.
I'm an officer.
I belong with my men.
Horseshit.
What's left of them.
MacKenzie was just brought in.
His leg's turned bad.
He said--
What?
What is it?
He said your brother volunteered to take his place... on the reconnaissance with the captain.
Goddamn it!
I told you to stay with him!
- I'm here!
- Where? I can't see.
I can't move!
I'm coming!
I got you now.
You're doing good.
We're going home.
God, no!
Goddamn you, God!
Tristan, it's me.
March 20, 1915.
Dear Father and Susannah:
I am being discharged from the Army, but I cannot come home yet.
I will ask Grand father Ludlow in Cornwall...
to let me join him at sea.
As for our beloved Samuel...
all I can send home is his heart.
Alfred will bring it back.
He should be buried up in the box canyon...
where he used to draw the birds.
Your son, Tristan.
He certainly was the best of all of us, wasn't he? 
Good night.
What you saw before Samuel left--
Please, don't--
No, I want to.
It is Samuel I loved.
All right.
Tristan will be back someday.
Your father will be pleased.
Susannah was to return to Boston on the morning train...
but a norther blew for three days... 
and drifted over the tracks.
The Colonel insisted she stay on until spring.
The house was too empty, he said.
This was still her home, he told her.
He should have let her go.
But how could he have known what would happen?
She was not to blame.
She was like the water that freezes in the rock...
and split sit apart.
It was no more her fault than it is the fault of the water...
when the rock shatters.
You know how much I--
You know how much I loved Samuel.
And I think you know--
Out of respect for him,
I wanted to say it here.
I think you know that...
I'm in love with you.
From the first moment I saw you... like in a novel.
That's my mother's overblown romantic imagination coming out in me.
You're not making this very easy for me.
Sorry.
Is there any hope that you could learn to love me?
Not the way you love Samuel, of course... but enough to--
We could make a life together.
A happy life.
I don't think so.
Sounds like you're not sure, though.
Maybe there's a chance?
- What?
- I can only cause you pain, Alfred.
Why not let me be the judge of that?
I didn't break it, but I can fix it.
I can put the damn wheel back on and take it off myself.
Go take a nap.
- What?
- Look!
I'm going into town if--
Welcome home, son.
I couldn't save him.
Of course you couldn't.
It's all right.
Have a nice ride today?
Excuse me, Father.
Tristan, please.
When are you planning to be married?
Good morning.
Damn you.
You will marry her.
- Make an honest woman of her?
- Yes!
God damn you to hell.
Yes, I will marry her, if she'll have me.
If she'll have you?
Do you love her?
Or did you seduce her just to spite me?
That's not what I did.
- What about Samuel?
- What?
You tell me about Samuel.
We all loved Samuel.
Samuel is dead.
How convenient for you.
Because you love her,
I will forgive you for that.
Once. You say that again, and we're not brothers.
You know you can't make her happy.
I'm gonna try.
You will fail.
I'll be leaving today.
I wish you both all the best.
- Good-bye, son.
- Wish me luck.
Good luck.
September 7, 1915.
Dearest Mother:
I think I may have found my place in this world.
Helena is a city turned modern overnight...
bursting with all the energy and vitality...
of our times.
I feel alive here.
There is much opportunity for anyone...
who dedicates himself to his labors.
Already, I have acquired a reputation for honesty and fair dealing...
and I am pleased to call some of Helena's most influential citizens...
my friends.
They are determined to see this city grow, as am I.
We're proud of you.
Mother, thank you for your kind letter.
You knew my hopes.
That you understand my disappointment is a great comfort to me.
Everynight I pray for the grace to forgive Tristan.
I know you understand.
Your loving son, Alfred.
Quit it! 
Goddamn it!
If we have a boy,
I'd like to call him Samuel.
And if it's a girl, Isabel.
I'll still love you.
You'll tolerate me because of how much I love you.
Nothing.
I heard from your mother.
She says Alfred has hooked up with those damn O'Banion brothers.
- He's doing well.
- Alfred will do well wherever he is.
- Except here with us.
- That's my fault.
- I didn't say that.
- Couldn't save Samuel either, could I?
Don't you dare say that.
That was in God's hands.
Was it?
Colonel! Lost a couple calves near Camas Canyon.
- Might be a grizzly.
- My grizzly?
- You take him, Tristan.
- Damn right I will.
I don't know why Tristan did not kill that damn old bear.
The Old Ones say:
"When a man and an animal... have spilled each other's blood... they become one."
I said four beers, Mr. Sachtleben.
And I said no Indians.
- He's quite civilized, I assure you.
- Yeah?
- Give him a beer.
- Stay out of it.
- My father said four.
- He heard me.
We're about to reach an understanding.
Just give him a goddamn beer!
Stay out of it!
Damn you.
You're a damn fool.
You're spoiling for a fight with a man who outweighs you.
As we speak, he's searching for some kind of a weapon.
Isn't that right?
To split your stupid skull and kill you and good riddance.
Leave it!
- Yes, sir?
- I want four beers, now.
The lousy owner says he doesn't want to serve Indians.
Get back.
Do you see this man?
Do you?
His name is One Stab.
He's a venerated Cree elder and has counted coup on hundreds of his enemies.
He's our friend.
He's thirsty.
I think it was the bear's voice he heard deep inside him... growling low of dark, secret places.
Were you going to say good-bye?
How long will you be gone?
Not long.
A few months.
I can make it better for you.
If we'd had a child... or if I were pregnant, would you still go?
Yes.
Just give me a chance.
Don't do that.
Look at me.
Please, look at me.
I'll wait for you.
However long it takes.
I'll wait for you forever.
Will he come back?
I don't know.
Stab says yes.
April 20, 1918.
Dear Tristan:
It has been months now, and still no word.
The only sign that you are alive...
is a tattered parcel that arrived today from New Guinea...
covered with strange writing...
and containing what appears to be a native bracelet. 
Meant for me, I presume.
But perhaps not.
Do you still care to know what is happening here?
Cattle prices continue to fall...
and winter seems never ending.
Why don't you write?
Are you afraid to tell me you're never coming back?
Alfred continues to do well.
His business has expanded to include financial concerns in Chicago...
and Washington.
I don't pretend to understand.
He wants us to send Isabel Two to boarding school in Chicago...
but she adamantly refuses to leave the ranch.
I think she, too, is waiting for you.
I have nowhere to send this letter... 
and no reason to believe you wish to receive it.
I write it only for myself.
I will hide it away with all the things left unsaid and undone...
between us.
December 12, 1919.
Dear Susannah:
I have become a hunter.
Tell Stab there are creatures here that cannot even be found in books.
I have killed them all.
All we had is dead.
As I am dead.
Marry another.
Colonel, it looks like we've got company.
- I have come to ask for your blessing.
- My blessing?
You see, these gentlemen and--
And a great many others,
I might add.
They're urging me to run for office.
- What office?
- The United States Congress.
That's how highly we think of your son.
And what do you gentlemen hope to get out of this?
I beg your pardon?
I've spoken plain English, sir.
What do you want for yourselves?
Father, I don't think that these gentlemen--
Did you ask that question or do you believe these gentlemen... would back you out of patriotic duty and your inestimable worth?
You forget yourself, Father.
I am no longer a child.
Colonel, the Congress--
Congress is government, sir.
I worked for the government once.
The issues that we--
Indians! 
Indians were the issue in those days.
There is nothing as grotesque... as the meeting of a child with a bullet... or an entire village slaughtered while sleeping.
That was the government's resolution of that particular issue.
I've seen nothing since then to persuade me it's gained... in wisdom, common sense or humanity.
Gentlemen, my father, for whom I have the deepest respect... says that the government has neither wisdom nor humanity.
I will then consider it my absolute duty as my father's son... to bring both wisdom and humanity to the United States Congress.
I thank you for your blessing.
Gentlemen.
- Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars.
- Yes. Certainly.
Are you all right?
What's wrong?
I don't know what to say.
Tristan's always been wild.
- You love him for that.
- Do I?
I suppose I do.
He does love you.
She's to be your brother's wife.
Yes, though you better remind him of that fact.
He's not here to defend himself.
No, but I see you are here to defend him and what is his... even though he's abandoned her and you.
I won't even speak of who else he abandoned.
Damn you, boy.
Don't you blame my son for Samuel's death!
Samuel chose to be a soldier, and soldiers die... sent to their slaughter by men in government.
Parasites like you!
Damn and blast you!
Damn you.
And damn you too!
Shut your mouth.
Leave her out of this!
Get out of my house and get off my land.
Why? Because I want to serve my country as you did?
Or because, like you,
I love a woman who doesn't love me?
He used her and deserted her, your darling Tristan.
Alfred, don't. Please.
I loved her!
I love her still.
He stole her from me.
If you want to know the truth... he stole her from Samuel before the war.
God help me, I'll kill you.
Here.
Read your darling Tristan's letter.
You deserve to be happy.
Late that night we found the Colonel on the floor... 
beside a cold fire.
He could not move.
His hair turned white over night...
and he became an old man.
And after that,
Tristan sent no more letters.
As the years passed by...
we would hear that someone had seen him on a ship...
going up some river no white man had gone up before.
Stories came to us.
Strange stories.
And then, for years, there was nothing.
He was lost to us.
That was all we knew.
But every year, in the Moon of the Falling Leaves...
I would dream that the bear's voice inside him had grown silent...
and that Tristan might again come to live in the world.
But then the winter would come.
And then another spring.
And still he stayed away.
What the hell is he doing?
She's a mean old bitch, but she's yours.
Welcome home.
Old man!
Where's Father?
He had a stroke some years ago.
He can't talk now.
Hello, Father.
He wants to celebrate.
I'm happy too.
Father, this is for you.
"Colonel William Ludlow, from his son Tristan."
I didn't know.
These are boars' tusks, made by a Javanese warrior.
He, too, was a great man.
I have other things for Mother and Little Izzy and Susannah.
What is it?
Alfred and Miss Susannah... were married several years ago.
Your brother's a congressman now.
They have a big, new place in Helena.
It's as it should be.
Cattle prices dropped after the war ended.
The Colonel don't seem to care.
He lost nearly everything he had.
We'll make it back... on horses or something else if we have to.
He's saying that your brother voted for the Volstead Act.
Did he? 
You suggesting I become a boot legger?
Good money in bootlegging, if you know what you're doing.
Screw the government.
Screw them.
Forever turned out to be too long.
I know.
Here.
I don't want it.
They told me that this was magic... that whoever wore it would be protected.
Keep it.
Don't you want to see Alfred?
It's probably better that I don't.
Tell him hello... and congratulations.
He likes you.
Welcome home.
Isabel?
I want you to have him.
I have something for you too.
I brought it back.
It's from Ierapetra. 
- That's in--
- Crete.
- Yeah.
- I know where it is.
Your father taught me European history.
A little girl.
That's me, right?
Thank you.
Okay, we'll see you in a few days.
Don't wait on me.
I'll be fine.
It was then that Tristan came into the quiet heart...
of his life.
The bear inside him was sleeping.
It is hard to tell of happiness.
Time goes by...
and we feel safe too soon.
- I heard the oddest news.
- Yes?
Yes.
Tristan... is back.
Yes, I know.
You know?
How do you know?
I saw him.
He had the audacity to come here just to see you?
He wanted to see you, but thought you'd get upset.
He might be right.
What did he--
What did he say?
He said to say hello... and congratulations.
Silly me.
He told you the news?
What do you think?
Come on.
It's perfectly absurd.
Marrying Isabel Two.
God, she's practically our sister.
She can't be more than, what, 19?
Twenty.
I can't imagine what the hell
Decker is thinking of... to allow this.
Perhaps he's thinking of his daughter's happiness.
Happiness?
With Tristan?
You, of all people, should know how impossible that is.
I'm not Isabel Two.
June 2, 1921.
Dear Tristan:
I was so pleased to hear of your coming marriage.
Your father must be very happy.
Isabel Two is like a daughter to him...
as she was named after your own mother.
It seems as though it was always meant to be, doesn't it?
Damnation.
Samuel Decker Ludlow.
Dearest Tristan:
Alfred and I were delighted to hear of your son's birth.
We hoped for a child of our own, but of that I despair.
I know Alfred thinks of you often.
I look forward to the day when we all might see one another again.
Your son bears a proud and noble name.
I know he will live up to it.
Please give my love to Isabel Two...
and to your father and everyone else.
Yours always, Susannah.
Evening, gentlemen.
Been meaning to talk to you about one or two things.
By all means.
As you know perfectly well... we handle the liquor around here.
Now, you've been a small-time operator.
An amateur, frankly.
Lately, your shipments have been getting a little fat... and my patience has been getting a little thin.
So the next time you get in our way... will be the last time.
Excuse me.
I appreciate it.
Perhaps you're wondering why you're not dead already.
Because your brother is Congressman Ludlow.
And that's it.
That's all.
Kenneth. Thomas.
Can't you just say hello?
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Tristan.
- Who's this young man?
- This is Samuel.
She's beautiful.
Let me see.
- Who is this lady?
- I'm your Aunt Susannah.
I used to know your Uncle Samuel who died in the war.
- You look like him.
- That's what Grandpa says.
He was very brave and very good.
Grandpa says that too.
Grandpa says I can have 
Uncle Samuel's gun when I'm bigger.
Would you come and see it?
I'd love to.
Sometime.
- He's a fine boy.
- He is.
- Is Father well?
- As well as can be expected.
- I wish--
- Pardon the intrusion.
Excuse me.
We're ready for your speech now.
I'll be there in a minute.
Thank you.
- We'll meet again soon?
- I'd like that.
What's this?
Go and get Tynert.
I think you missed a bump, Stab.
Jesus!
Sir, we have information that you're transporting goods... in violation of the Volstead Act.
If you mean a case of Irish whiskey for my father, I am.
Give it up.
He'll be disappointed.
Hold him down.
Let's get out of here.
- There's an envelope in his pocket.
- Now.
My brother told you to stay out of our way.
Put him in the car.
- I don't want to see him.
- Father--
I'm so very sorry.
Father won't see me, even now?
He blames the government for Isabel's--
There's something we have to talk about.
The officer you beat almost died.
Now, everyone understands... but you'll have to plead guilty... serve 30 days.
And the one who shot his gun?
He was... reprimanded.
- The O'Banions?
- Nothing.
You have to let it go.
It was a terrible, tragic accident.
Listen to me.
You let this go now.
You got in over your head.
I'll need a minute.
I'm so sorry.
We all loved her.
How are you?
I'm fine.
We never get to see you.
I gave a speech the other day.
- You did?
- Yes.
My first public engagement.
It was on the responsibilities of women in--
It's good to see you.
I'm sorry.
I still sometimes dream... that I'm the mother of your children.
I wanted her to die.
Maybe I even wanted Samuel to die.
You had nothing to do with Samuel's death. 
And you had nothing to do with Isabel's death.
Didn't I?
Go home.
Go home to Alfred.
Where were you?
I just went out for a walk.
I needed a walk.
What are you doing home?
Your doctor rang, said you missed your appointment.
I called home.
You weren't here. I--
I feel very tired.
I'm going to bed.
You have won her.
I am bringing her home.
Alfred.
I followed all the rules: man's and God's.
And you--
You followed none.
And they all loved you more.
Samuel, Father... and even my own wife.
I'd like a moment alone with her.
When Samuel died--
When Samuel died, I cursed God.
Did I damn everybody around me as well as myself?
You are not damned.
I won't allow that.
You're not damned!
Samuel, this is a gentleman's gun.
It's smaller, but it's just as powerful.
That's what you want when you grow up, isn't it? A gun.
Samuel, come here!
Run along now. Go with Pet.
Get him in the house.
He's a fine boy.
You know we're not here to arrest you.
You take me to the woods so my boy won't see.
I don't want my boy to see.
Let's get on with it.
- Father.
- Colonel Ludlow, sir.
What's going on here?
You don't have to be a genius to know they'll come after you for this.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I want to ask you to watch over my children.
Watch over Samuel.
Brother, it would be an honor.
How much I wanted to take scalps...
but it was not my kill.
That night, we buried the bodies... 
and dumped the carina deep pool in the upper Missouri.
I remember when he was a boy...
I thought Tristan would never live to be an old man.
I was wrong about that.
I was wrong about many things.
It was those who loved him most who died young.
He was a rock they broke themselves against...
however much he tried to protect them.
But he had his honor...
and a long life...
and he saw his children grow...
and raise their own families.
Tristan died in 1963...
in the Moon of the Popping Trees.
He was last seen up in the north country...
where the hunting was still good.
His grave is unmarked...
but it does not matter.
He had always lived in the borderland anyway:
somewhere between this world and the other.
It was a good death.
Now!
Send the infantry.
-Milord...
-You lead them!
Retreat!
Bastard!
All right.
-Wallace!
-Wallace!
Wallace! Wallace!
Wallace! Wallace!
Wallace! Wallace!
I knight thee Sir William Wallace.
Sir William, in the name of God, we declare and appoint thee guardian and high protector of Scotland and thy captains as aides-de-camp.
Stand and be recognized.
Does anyone know his politics?
No, but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything.
The Balliols will kiss his arse, and so we must.
Sir William.
Sir William, inasmuch as you and your captains hail from a region long known to support the Balliol clan, may we invite you to continue your support and uphold our rightful claim?
Damn the Balliol clan!
They're all Longshanks' men!
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!
-Now is the time to declare a king.
-Wait!
And you're prepared to recognize our legitimate succession, I take it.
You're the ones who won't support the rightful king.
Those were lies when you first wrote them.
-No.
-That's the truth.
I demand recognition of these documents!
These documents were lies when you wrote them!
Gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!
Please, gentlemen!
Wait! Sir William, where are you going?
We have beaten the English, but they'll come back because you won't stand together.
What will you do?
I will invade England and defeat the English on their own ground.
Invade? That's impossible.
Why?
Why is that impossible?
You're so concerned with squabbling for the scraps from Longshanks' table that you've missed your God-given right to something better.
There's a difference between us.
You think the people of this country exist to provide you with position.
I think your position exists to provide those people with freedom, and I go to make sure that they have it.
Wait!
I respect what you said, but remember that these men have lands and castles.
It's much to risk.
And the common man that bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No.
But from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.
Its nobles share allegiance with England.
Its clans war with each other.
-Aye.
-Aye.
If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
We all end up dead.
It's just a question of how and why.
I'm not a coward. I want what you want, but we need the nobles.
-We need them?
-Aye.
Nobles.
Now, tell me, what does that mean, to be noble?
Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country, but men don't follow titles.
They follow courage.
Now, our people know you.
Noble and common, they respect you, and if you would just lead them to freedom, they'd follow you.
And so would I.
Damn it!
My sodomite cousin the prince tells me he has no troops to lend, and every town in northern England is begging for help.
-He advances!
-To which town?
To here, milord.
Bring the food and provisions inside.
Double the wall guards, seal the gate.
Now!
Bring in the provisions!
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.
I'm not about to tell my uncle
I've lost him the greatest city in northern England.
Come on!
Make way for the king!
It's not your fault.
Stand up to him!
I will stand up to him and more.
What news of the north?
Nothing new, Your Majesty.
We've sent riders to speed any word.
I heard the word in France, where I was fighting to expand your future kingdom.
The word, my son, is that our entire northern army is annihilated, and you have done nothing.
I have ordered conscriptions, sir.
They're assembled and ready to depart.
Excuse me, sire, but there's a very urgent message from York.
Come.
-Leave us.
-Thank you, sire.
-Wallace has sacked York.
-What?
Wallace has sacked York!
Sire, thy own nephew.
What beast could do such a thing?
If he can sack York, he can invade lower England.
We would stop him!
Who is this person who speaks to me as though I needed his advice?
I have declared Phillip my high counselor.
Is he qualified?
I am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics, sire.
Are you?
Then tell me, what advice would you offer on the present situation?
I shall offer a truce and buy him off.
But who will go to him? Not I.
If I fell under the sword of that murderer, it might be my head in a basket.
And not my gentle son.
The mere sight of him would only encourage an enemy to take over the whole country.
So whom do I send?
Whom do I send?
I'm dreaming.
Yes, you are.
And you must wake.
I don't want to wake.
I want to stay here with you.
And I with you, but you must wake now.
Wake up, William.
Wake up.
William, wake up, wake up.
William!
A royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce and the standards of Longshanks himself!
I am the Princess of Wales.
I come as the king's servant and with his authority.
To do what?
To discuss the king's proposals.
Will you speak with a woman?
I understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.
I have been given nothing.
God makes men what they are.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities, the executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country, and that royal cousin hanged innocent Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Longshanks did far worse the last time he took a Scottish city.
You ask your king to his face.
Ask him.
You see if his eyes can convince you of the truth.
Hamilton, leave us.
-Milady...
-Leave us. Now.
Let us talk plainly.
You invade England, but you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply.
The king desires peace.
Longshanks desires peace?
He declares it to me. I swear it.
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.
In return, he grants you title, estates, and this chest of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
A lordship and titles.
Gold.
That I should become Judas?
Peace is made in such ways.
Slaves are made in such ways!
The last time Longshanks spoke of peace, I was a boy, and many Scottish nobles, who would not be slaves, were lured by him, under a flag of truce, to a barn where he had them hanged.
I was very young, but I remember Longshanks' notion of peace.
I understand you have suffered.
I know about your woman.
She was my wife.
We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord.
They killed her to get to me.
I have never spoken of it.
I don't know why I tell you now, except I see her strength in you.
One day, you'll be a queen, and you must open your eyes.
You tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled, and nor will any Scot while I live.
My son's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen.
So he accepted our bribe?
No, he did not.
Then why does he stay?
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.
He waits for you at York.
He says he will attack no more towns or cities if you are man enough to come and face him.
Did he?
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far around his flank.
The main force of our armies from France will land here
The main force of our armies from France will land here to the north of Edinburgh.
Conscripts from Ireland will approach from the southwest to here.
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?
Even if you dispatch them today, they'd take weeks to assemble.
I dispatched them before I sent your wife.
So our little ruse succeeded.
Thank you.
And while this upstart awaits my arrival in York, my forces will have arrived in Edinburgh behind him.
You spoke with this Wallace in private.
Tell me, what kind of man is he?
A mindless barbarian.
Not a king like you, milord.
You may return to your embroidery.
Humbly, milord.
You brought back the money, of course.
No. I gave it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
That's what happens when you send a woman.
Forgive me, sire.
I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
My greatness will be better demonstrated when Wallace returns to Scotland and finds his country in ashes.
William!
There's riders approaching!
Personal escort of the princess.
Aye.
Must have made an impression.
Aye.
I didn't think you were in the tent that long.
Mademoiselle.
It's true! English ships are moving up from the south!
I don't know about the Welsh yet, but the Irish have landed!
I had to see it with me own eyes before I could believe it.
What the hell are the Irish doing fighting with the English?
I wouldn't worry about them.
Didn't I tell you before? It's my island.
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh and assemble the council.
-Order it.
-Aye.
-Your island?
-My island! Yup!
You want to negotiate?
No, please, gentlemen!
Lords, Craig is right!
This time, our only option is to negotiate.
Now, unless you want to see Edinburgh razed to the ground...
My army has marched for more days than I can remember and we still have preparations to make, so I'll make this plain.
We require every soldier you can summon.
Your personal escorts, even yourselves, and we need them now.
With such a force arrayed against us, it's time to discuss other options.
Other options?
Don't you wish at least to lead your men onto the field and barter a better deal with Longshanks before you tuck tail and run?
-Sir William...
-We can't defeat this army!
-We can! And we will!
-Sir William!
We won at Stirling, and still you quibble!
We won at York, and you would not support us.
If you'll not stand up with us now, then I say you're cowards.
And if you are Scotsmen,
I'm ashamed to call myself one.
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.
I beg you.
Now, you've achieved more than anyone ever dreamed, but fighting these odds, it looks like rage, not courage.
It's well beyond rage.
Help me.
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!
Now is our chance. Now.
If we join, we can win.
If we win, well, then we'll have what none of us have ever had before.
A country of our own.
You're the rightful leader, and there is strength in you. I see it.
Unite us.
Unite us!
Unite the clans.
All right.
Right.
This cannot be the way.
You said yourself, the nobles will not support Wallace.
So how does it help us to join the side that is slaughtered?
I gave him my word.
I know it is hard.
Being a leader is.
Now, Son...
Son, look at me.
I cannot be king.
You and you alone can rule Scotland.
What I tell you, you must do.
Not for me, not for yourself, for your country.
Lads, make way.
Coming through.
Make way, lads.
Make...
The Bruce is not coming, William.
He'll come.
Mornay and Lochlan have come, so will the Bruce.
Quite a lovely gathering.
Wouldn't you agree?
The archers are ready, sire.
Not the archers.
My scouts tell me their archers are miles away and no threat to us.
Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.
The dead cost nothing.
And send in the infantry and cavalry.
Infantry!
-Infantry!
-Infantry!
Cavalry!
-Cavalry!
-Cavalry!
-Cavalry!
-Cavalry!
Advance!
-Advance!
-Advance!
-Good to see you this morning!
-Hi. How are you?
Irish.
Glad to have you with us.
Watch this.
Mornay? Lochlan?
I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland with matching estates in England.
Lochlan turned for much less.
Archers.
I beg pardon, sire.
Won't we hit our own troops?
Yes, but we'll hit theirs as well.
We have reserves.
Attack.
Archers!
-Archers.
-Archers.
Loose!
Loose!
Send in our reinforcements.
Send in the rest!
Bring me Wallace.
Alive, if possible.
Dead, just as good.
Send us news of our victory.
Shall we retire?
Protect the king.
Get up!
Get up!
Up!
Get up!
-Get him out of here!
-Jesus!
Go!
I'm dying.
Let me be.
No.
You're going to live.
I've lived long enough to live free.
Proud to see you become the man you are.
I'm a happy man.
I'm the one who's rotting, but I think your face looks graver than mine.
Son, we must have alliance with England to prevail here.
You achieved that.
You saved your family, increased your land.
In time, you will have all the power in Scotland.
Lands, titles, men, power, nothing.
-Nothing?
-I have nothing.
Men fight for me because if they do not,
I throw them off my land and I starve their wives and their children.
Those men who bled the ground red at Falkirk, they fought for William Wallace, and he fights for something that I've never had.
And I took it from him when I betrayed him, and I saw it in his face on the battlefield, and it's tearing me apart!
All men betray, all lose heart.
I don't want to lose heart!
I want to believe, as he does.
I will never be on the wrong side again.
No, please!
There he is! After him!
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?
Aye.
Wallace rode into his bedchamber and killed him.
More a liability now than ever he was.
And there's no telling who'll be next.
Maybe you.
Maybe me.
It doesn't matter.
-I'm serious, Robert.
-So am I!
Christ! Shit!
Search the place!
Lochlan.
William Wallace killed 50 men.
Fifty if it was one.
A hundred men with his own sword.
Cut through them like...
Moses through the Red Sea.
His legend grows.
It will be worse than before.
He rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, and when he replenishes his numbers...
They're sheep, mere sheep!
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.
Very well.
Pick a flock of your finest assassins and set a meeting.
Milord, Wallace is renowned for his ability to smell an ambush.
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct, he warmed to our future queen and would trust her.
So we'll dispatch her with the notion that she comes in peace.
Milord, the princess might be taken hostage or her life be put in jeopardy.
My son would be most distressed by that.
But in truth, if she were to be killed, we would soon find the king of France a useful ally against the Scots.
You see, as king, you must find the good in any situation.
It's William Wallace, sure.
He's given up his sword.
Be ready.
Milady,
I received your message.
This is the second time you have warned me of danger.
Why?
There will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month.
Foods and weapons. They won't...
No, stop.
Why do you help me?
Why do you help me?
Because of the way you are looking at me now.
Just when we thought all hope was lost, our noble saviors have arrived.
Off with their hoods.
Sir William, we've come to seek a meeting.
Well, what's the point?
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.
Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.
Others think you'll pay them
Mornay's wages.
So we bid you to Edinburgh.
Meet us two days from now.
Pledge us your pardon, and we'll unite behind you.
Scotland will be one.
-One? You mean us and you.
-No.
I mean this.
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.
I think if the Bruce wanted to kill you, he'd have done it already at Falkirk.
-Aye.
-I know. I saw.
Leaving him aside, what about the others?
Nest of scheming bastards!
They couldn't even agree on the color of shite!
It's a trap. Are you blind?
Look at us.
We've got to try. We can't do this alone.
Joining the nobles is the only hope for our people.
You know what happens if we don't take that chance?
What?
Nothing.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Nor I. I want to live.
I want a home and children and peace.
-Do you?
-Aye, I do.
I've asked God for those things.
It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.
-That's just a dream, William.
-A dream? Just a...
Then what have we been doing all this time?
We've lived that dream.
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron.
You're doing this to be a hero
'cause you think she sees you.
I don't think she sees me.
I know she does.
And your father sees you, too.
Jesus.
Get up. Give us your hand.
Shall I come with you?
No. I'll go alone.
I'll see you after.
Right.
Sooner rather than later, I hope.
-He won't come.
-He will.
I know he will.
Milord, he approaches!
No!
Stay out of it, Robert!
You lied! You lied!
Bruce is not to be hurt!
That's the arrangement!
Father!
You rotting bastard!
Why? Why?
Longshanks required Wallace.
So did our nobles.
That was the price of your crown.
Die!
I want you to die!
Soon enough, I'll be dead and you'll be king.
I don't want anything from you.
You're not a man!
And you're not my father.
You're my son, and you have always known my mind.
You deceived me.
You let yourself be deceived.
In your heart, you always knew what had to happen here.
At last, you know what it means to hate.
Now you're ready to be a king.
My hate will die with you.
William Wallace, you stand in taint of high treason.
Against whom?
Against your king.
Have you anything to say?
Never in my whole life did I swear allegiance to him.
It matters not. He is your king.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death.
Deny, and you must be purified by pain.
Do you confess?
Do you confess?
Then on the morrow, you shall receive your purification.
-Your Highness.
-I will see the prisoner.
We've got orders from the king that nobody...
The king will be dead in a month and his son is a weakling.
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?
Now open this door.
Majesty.
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.
Stop it!
Leave me.
I said leave me!
Milady.
Sir, I come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country?
Mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live in a tower.
In time, who knows what can happen if you can only live.
If I swear to him, then all that I am is dead already.
You will die. It will be awful.
Every man dies.
Not every man really lives.
Drink this.
It will dull your pain.
No. It will numb my wits, and I must have them all.
For if I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I can't bear the thought of your torture.
Take it.
All right.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?
I respect him.
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.
Show mercy, O thou great king, and win the respect of your own people.
Even now, you are incapable of mercy.
And you...
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
You see, death comes to us all.
But before it comes to you, know this.
Your blood dies with you.
A child who is not of your line grows in my belly.
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.
I'm so afraid.
Give me the strength to die well.
Here he comes!
Now behold the awful price of treason!
You will fall to your knees now, declare yourself the king's loyal subject and beg his mercy.
And you shall have it.
Rope!
Stretch him!
That's it! Stretch him!
Shame! Shame!
Pleasant, yes?
Rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more.
Rack him!
Enough?
It can all end right now.
Peace.
Just say it.
Cry out, ''Mercy.''
Mercy!
-Mercy!
-Mercy!
-Mercy!
-Mercy!
Cry out.
Mercy! Mercy!
Just say it.
Mercy.
Mercy! Mercy!
Mercy, William.
-Mercy.
-Jesus, now say it.
The prisoner wishes to say a word.
Mercy! Mercy!
Mercy!
Freedom!
After the beheading,
William Wallace's body
was torn to pieces.
His head was set on London Bridge,
his arms and legs sent
to the four corners of Britain
as a warning.
It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.
And I, Robert the Bruce,
rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English king
rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English king
and accept his endorsement
of my crown.
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.
It's about to be kissed by a king.
Come. Let's get it over with.
Stop!
You have bled with Wallace!
Now bleed with me.
Wallace! Wallace!
-Wallace! Wallace!
-Wallace! Wallace!
-Wallace! Wallace!
-Wallace! Wallace!
In the year of our Lord, 1314,
patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,
charged the fields of Bannockburn.
They fought like warrior poets.
They fought like Scotsmen,
and won their freedom.
-Yeah
-What’s that
Yeah
-Yeah
-Funky, funky
-How ‘bout a big hand now
-Wait-Wait a minute
Groovy, groovy, jazzy, funky pounce, pounce dance
As we dip in the melodic sea the rhythm keeps flowing and drips to M.C.
Sweet, sugar pop sugar pop, roxy pop
You don’t stop
‘til the sweet beat drops
I’m showin’ proof as I stick and move, every poem’s recited on top of the groove
Smooth my floatin’ like a butterfly, notes that are floatin’ sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya dip trip, flip fantasia
[ Radio ]
-Yeah
-What’s that
-Biddy-diddy bop
-Yeah
Biddy-diddy bop
Funky, funky funky, funky
-Would you like another muffin?
-No, that’s, uh, fine.
[ Clears Throat ]
Just take one, please.
I’ll give you another. They check in, but they don’t check-out. Billy Rago wrote that.
The guy was practically a god in New York.
Worked for all the heavy shops... before we got him out here, and I’m telling you, we had to beg.
It’s got to be the traffic.
He’s always on time.
Have another muffin.
I’ll see what I can do.
-[ Man On Radio ] W-E-Z,
Detroit. The Big Wheeze.!
-[ Phone Rings ]
-Yeah?
-Where are you?
Where am I?
Take a look out the window.
I’m parked in the middle of Jefferson.
-I’ve been here for 20 minutes.
-What?
It’s construction everywhere.
They’re laying down cones.
Hey.! You had to pick today?
These guys are on a 1 0:30 back to Chicago. They’re not the sitting-around types.
I’m 500 yards away.
Can’t you stall ‘em? Give ‘em a muffin.
I’ve been stalling. We talked about the Bulls three times.
They didn’t like the muffins.
-Just put me on the speaker.
-What? No way.
-I’ll pitch in on the phone.
Let me talk to these clowns.
-Okay.
Uh, we’re gonna try a little modern science here.
We do it all the time.
-Bill, you still with us?
-Uh, yeah. Can they hear me?
Bill, I want you to meet Noah Bradley and Peter Brosnan of Key Brands.
-Morning.
-Noah. Pete. Good to see ya.
Yeah, Bill, listen, we really do have a plane to catch.
Hey, guys, I mean, can’t you wait ten minutes? It’s not the last flight out of town.
-Jack, flip up the first panel.
-Bill, I think--
Just flip up the first panel!
Jesus, a lab monkey could do that!
-Okay, now.
-Let me take you to the panels.
When you think of food wrap, you think of America, baseball, Mom... apple pie, the old west.
-Speaking of which, you should be looking at a sheriff.
-[ Together] Yeah.
Yeah, well he’s sittin’ there and he’s got his feet up on the desk, see.
Now, behind him, his jail cell is covered with Key Brands food wrap.
Right? Now, we got all this food inside tryin’ to escape.
We got an actor dressed up as a melon.
One is a wedge of cheese.
Another one is uh, um, is a, uh, um, um--
-Another one is, uh--
-A sandwich.
Okay. A sandwich. Right.
And the sheriff smiles into the camera and he says--
Blow it out your butt, tubby!
That’s right, wide load. I’m talkin’ to you, fatso. You guys aren’t fat?
Anyway, so the sheriff’s lookin’ right into the camera and he says...
Partners, there’s only one way--
[ Static ]
"Key Brand--’"[ Static Continues ]
"... Name that means qual--’"
-[ Static ] You get a sheriff like...
-I think we’re having a little phone trouble.
-the guy from Gunsmoke.
-Bill, you’ve gone into cell hell.
[ Woman ]
Hi, I’m Joy.
If you want to be dominated, press one.
If you want to discipline me, press two.
-No, that’s not Bill.
We’ve got some crossover here.
-[ Man ] How many kilos?
Stop it!
Moms will love it. Dads’ll love it.
Kids are gonna have shiny badges, boots.
Look, I may lose you in the elevator, but I’ll see you in a couple of seconds.
-[ Elevator Bell Rings ]
-You got me? Hello?
-One, two, three, four--okay.
-Good morning. Shorris-Grey Advertising.
Whoo! Traffic was a--
-[ Panting ] Where are they?
-[ Groans ]
I’ll pack up your office.
I kept the boxes we moved in with. It’ll save a few bucks.
-[Jack ] Let me talk to him.
-[ Man ] Tell him to print up some resumes.
His work’s slipping. He’s hostile to clients. I couldn’t believe it.!
A six-million-dollar account and what do you got?
-You got two guys staring at a speaker phone!
-What was I supposed to do?
You were supposed to be working with professionals.
-I’ve never seen a stunt like that in my life.
-Paul, look.
The man’s had a few personal setbacks the last couple years.
[ Beeps ]
[ Man ] Yes, this is Evan from
You-Love-To-Rent Furniture.
You love to rent, but apparently, you don’t love to pay.
Our truck will be there at 9::00 a.m.
Thank you. [ Machine Beeps ]
Bill, it’s Jack. Listen,
I’m making a few calls... but I got to tell ya, you burned a few bridges out there, pal.
Now, I’m gonna try and line up some freelance stuff next month.
Just stay in touch, okay?
Bye.
[ Machine Beeps ]
Mr. Rago, my name’s Akeem.
I deliver your Free Press.
You still owe me $ 1 1.50.
[ Machine Beeps ]
Hi, Daddy. It’s me, Emily.
Daddy, I know you’re probably still at work, but, uh, listen.
I hate to ask you this, but Mom said she’s broke until next month... and since you just got that big, new
Key Brands account, I had to ask you.
So, here it goes. There’s an eclipse coming up in Mexico, and it’s a big deal.
My whole astronomy club is going. If we get the ticket early enough, it’ll be cheap.
This is really important to me.
I really, really want to go.
There it is. Thanks, Daddy.
[ Machine Beeps ]
[ People Singing ]
-Hey, buddy, you got two bits?
-No.
[ Harmonizing ]
I’m flat broke but I don’t care
[ Female Clerk ]
How many times I gotta tell you?
-You can’t collect unemployment if you don’t look for a job.
-[ Grunts ]
[ Male Clerk ]
If you bring that in, we’ll help you.
-Thank you.
-Next!
[ Exhales, Sighs ]
-You were in advertising, I see. Hmm!
-Yeah.
Princeton?
-Yeah.
-Guess that was before it went co-ed. [ Laughs ]
My, my, schools like that, you think they’d teach you how to read.
-Wrong line.
-What?
New claims are the two windows at the end. You get that stamped, you come back to me.
What are you, crazy?
I’ve been here since 9:00.
So have I. Next!
-[ Female Clerk ] Number 1 25.
-[ Woman ] Okay.
-You’ll hear from us. Next!
-Thanks.
You think there’s a chance
I could get unemployment before I get social security?
Have you previously collected benefits?
No. I’ve always had a job.
Can you operate any industrial machinery, farm equipment?
Yeah. That was a required course in college. Theory of Plowing.
I have all day, Bill.
Now, why don’t you tell me what you’d be willing to do?
If you give me a check,
I’d be willing to cash it.
Come here.
Come here.
Now, this is your first time here, right?
A man your age. It can’t be easy.
You’re humiliated.
You’re frustrated.
I see it on a hundred people’s faces everyday.
And whether you believe it or not,
I feel for each and every one of’ em.
Now... you can either help me help you, or you can be an asshole... in which case
I’m gonna make you stand there until you die and turn to dust.
So... let’s begin again.
Have you previously collected benefits?
No.
What would you be willing to do?
Milk cows.
Uh... shear sheep.
-Pluck chickens.
-All right, Bill.
A couple of weeks you’ll hear from us. Next.!
[ Bill ] Smack it.! Run.!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.!
-Aw! Oh!
-Bang, bang, bang.
He can’t run. Two million dollars a year, he runs like Bill Clinton.
The eclipse, Dad. Mexico.
Come on, Emily.
You don’t wanna go down there.
It’s a hundred degrees.
You get held up at the airport.
-You probably won’t get off the toilet long enough to see it, anyway.
-Dad!
[ Bill Groans ]
Astronomy? Jesus, when are you gonna grow up?
-I am growin’ up.
You know it’s what I wanna do.
-Damn!
There’s the path to big bucks.
Starin’ out into space. Look!
I discovered Venus. Pay me.
Astrology, maybe you could make a few dollars doin’ people’s horoscopes or somethin’.
Why do you always have to be such a jerk about all this for?
-Frozen malts.
-You want a frozen malt?
-No.
-Gimme two. Gimme two.
Em. Wait a minute. Em, come on.
I’m sure you’ll find a very nice eclipse to see around here someday.
-Yeah, in the year 2047!
-You want your pennant?
No, I just want you to believe in me.
[ People Singing ]
-Hi, guys, how ya doin’? Okay.
-Okay.
You feel like you wanna drown
-Next!
-Hi, Beverly.
-Bill. Good to see you.
-How are the kids?
-Great. Everything’s great.
-Good.
-How’s your daughter?
-She hates my guts.
Surprise, surprise.
You know, it’s strange.
I don’t like you either.
Yet somehow I’m gonna miss you.
We found you a job.
There you go.
What do you think?
No, no, no, no. I--Beverly.
You got the wrong file.
When have I ever been a teacher?
Look, you got a master’s degree.
That means you can teach.
No, it doesn’t. No, it only means hypothetically that I could.
Come on, Bill.
Now, it’s a good job. Six weeks.
A decent salary.
And you get to live there.
Bev-Beverly,
I-I’ll get my head blown off.
Do you know how many kids carry guns to school these days?
Hmph! In this case, all of’ em.
[ Chuckles ] I guess you didn’t get to the "where’" part.
Must be the army that’s turning me on
Must be the army that’s making me strong
Yes, sir.
Sir. Halt.
-May I help you?
-Yeah.
I need directions to the Army Education Center.
A.E.C.? That’s building 231 0.
Park your vehicle in the green zone, step inside, get a pass.
I’m runnin’ a little late.
Can’t I drive somewhere?
Yes, sir. You can drive to the green zone and get a pass.
Look, I’m not even in the army.
I just have to meet--
Park in the green zone, step inside, get a pass!
Right.
Green zone, inside, pass.
You’d probably get along good with my ex-wife.
I’m just a soldier, Sergeant marching for you
[ Drill Sergeant ]  I will not quit until P.T. is through
-I will not quit until P.T. is through
-Excuse me.
Excuse me. I’m lookin’ for the Army Education Center.
Captain Tom Murdoch.
Captain Murdoch’s not at the A.E.C.
Captain Murdoch’s at the A.R.C.
A.R.C., A.E.C.
You lookin’ for Captain Murdoch?
The A.E.C. is building 231 0.
-You want building 4475.
Look, here’s what you do. You go right here. Take another right at the P.X.
Go half a click ‘til you see the D.P.T.M. Center.
-Then take a left.
-P.M., P.X.
[ Sighs ]
D.P.T.M.
R.F.P.C.
Can I buy a vowel?
[ Ringing ]
Captain Murdoch’s office.
May I help you? Oh, hi again, sir.
-Can you hold?
-Okay, Sergeant, these are ready to go.
-Uh, sir.
-Bill Rago.
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Well, actually, I needed to catch up on world events.
-That Gulf War thing worked out for us, huh?
-Sure did.
I’m Tom Murdoch. Welcome to Fort McClane.
Would you come with me, please?
-Give us a couple of minutes.
-Sir, the extra housing units.
I’m workin’ on it.
They keep shutting down forts on us and we’ve picked up troops from every goddamn one.
I got 1 5 buses coming in at 21 00. Fifteen!
-Bummer.
-I’ve got that key somewhere.
Uh, uh... here it is.
Would you come with me, please, Bill?
-You mean, go?
-Yeah, after you.
-Ever been in the army?
-No.
Good. I’ll show you around and explain your job to you.
-The sergeant sent us a list of names.
-Next.
No go, they said.
These are the ones who can’t hack it.
-None of’ em wanted the boot.
They all volunteered.
-Ouch!
-[ Groans ]
-Come on, Bill. It don’t hurt much. They all go through it.
Where was I? That’s when
Colonel James stepped in.
He put out a call to find the kids that could best be served by this program.
-[ Panting ]
-Keep breathing.
-This is sick.
-Bill?
-You all right? What are they gonna catch in Michigan?
Bill? Stay with me, okay?
The point is, their Drill Sergeants out there in the field... didn’t have the time to explain everything a dozen times over to these guys.
As far as I’m concerned, they shouldn’t have to. But that’s strictly between you and me.
-Okay.
-Hoo-ah, Drill Sergeant!
-I can’t hear you!
-Hoo-ah, Drill Sergeant!
[ Capt. Murdoch ] So the squeakers we’re talkin’ about are in your file.
-Why don’t you just send the squeakers home?
-That’s a darn good question.
Ask the colonel. He keeps insisting if we can help ‘em do push-ups... we can give ‘em a hand in the brain department.
That’s where you come in, Wild Bill.
You’re it for these guys.
-The last chance saloon.
Sergeant Save-it.
-Is it much further?
-What’s this?
-Oh, isn’t that a thing of beauty?
That’s our victory tower.
Biggest one in the country.
We give ‘em physical confidence.
Doesn’t do much good if they got sawdust for brains.
What we need you to do is to get ‘em to think a little better on their feet. That’s all.
-[ Screaming ]
-Oops.
Must be one of yours, Bill.
[ Laughing ]
Let me get this straight.
-The colonel selected these eight kids for his program?
-Right.
-And you want me to teach these guys how to comprehend?
-Yes, sir.
-Hard stroke left!
-[ Recruits Shouting ] Kill! Kill!
Are they saying kill?
-You betcha.
-[ Recruits ] Kill! Kill!
Victory Starts Here.
That’s Fort McClane’s motto.
Novel.
Here it is, Bill.
Home sweet home.
-[ Recruits Singing ]
-They never stop singing.
What about my car and all my stuff?
Don’t worry about a thing, Bill.
It’s all taken care of.
Would you like to do the honors?
Yeah. [ Sighs ]
I’ve died and gone to Gomer Pyle’s house.
[ Murdoch ] He’s a marine, Bill.
What did I tell ya?
-[ Door Closes ]
-Bill.
Your bedroom with a closet and a latrine are right over here.
-[ Bill ] Mmm, elegant.
-Come on. Lots to see.
And you were worried about your stuff.
All-purpose table.
And... you share this lovely kitchen with the people next door.
-What?
-It’s a Scandinavian thing.
Simplicity of design. Economy.
-Uh, the Swedes I think.
-You ever wonder why so many of’ em blow their brains out?
[ Chuckles ]
I’m gonna use that one.
I’ll let you get washed up, Bill.
You got 40 minutes ‘til your first class.
Cheer up, will you?
You’re serving your country now.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Exhales ] I’m honored.
I won an advertising award.
What am I doin’ here?
[ Sighs ]
-Maybe I could hock it.
-[ Banging ]
[ Recruits Chanting ]
Hi. [ Chuckles ]
I’m Bill Rago.
Uh, welcome to... the first class in basic comprehension.
[ Exhales ]
I’ve never taught before... and you’ve never thought before,
[ Chuckles ] so good luck to all of us.
[ Sighs ]
Oh.
[ Mumbles ] What am I gonna do?
-[ Man ] Left.! Left, right.
-[ Recruits ] Warriors.!
-Left! Left! Left, right!
-Warriors!
-Left.! Left.! Left, right.!
-One, two, Warriors.!

Sir, Private Benitez, 7 061 , sir!
-Sir, Private Haywood, 389--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[ Chuckles ] Lighten up. Uh, you guys don’t have to do this.
This is just a class. We’re not invading Angola here. [ Chuckles ]
Uh--
-Um--
-Sir, permission to speak, sir.
-Yeah, sure, speak.
-Sir, what should we call you, sir?
Bill.
[ Clears Throat ]
Uh, si-sir! I think the private means your rank, sir!
Well, I don’t have one.
I’m a civilian.
-Oh, man.
-What?
You got to be kidding me. They let a civilian in here. I don’t believe this.
To teach double-D’s? Who do you think they gonna get, Colin Powell?
-[ Squad Leader ] Squad, sit.
-I ain’t no double-D, homeboy.
You speak for your damn self.
Wait, hold up. You in here by accident? You somebody special? I don’t think so.
-Sit your dumb double-D ass down, Haywood.
-Screw you.
-Asswipe.
-Screw you!
-[ All Chattering At Once ]
-You wanna sit down or you want me to sit you down?
Haywood!
Haywood!
-Stop it.!
-Whoa, whoa.
-Guys, guys.
-Haywood, sit down. Yo, yo.
-Sit down. Sit down.
-That’s Shaolin, see?
-Why don’t you do something?
-What do you want me to do?
Haywood, sit down.
Haywood, sit down.
Hey! Hello? Hello!
-[ All Chattering At Once ]
-[ Whistling ]
What the hell’s goin’ on here?
-That dumb-ass hillbilly talkin’ that bullshit.
-Look at your dumb ass.
Haywood, please!
-Look, you don’t wanna be here and I don’t wanna be here.
-You got that right.
So let’s just make the best of this, okay?
God! Squeakers.
And what’s a double-D?
The whole fort calls us double-D’s.
[ Barking Continues ]
[ Howling ]
All right, I’m supposed to take attendance now.
So, uh, help me out, all right?
[ Whispers ]
I’ll help you out.
-Benitez, Donald.
-Yup, yup.
That’s me. Present.
New York City, New York.
-[ Scoffs ] Who would a guessed?
-You’re killin’ me, Haywood.
-[ Haywood ] I just might.
-Haywood.
Here we go. Tommy Lee.
Present, sir. Tommy Lee Haywood.
Willacoochee, Georgia.
Is that as small as it sounds?
-No, sir.
-Sooey.!
Small? This boy grew up in a cave.
His mother come downstairs every morning.
[ Stomping ] Tommy Lee.
Time for breakfast. Run on out there and scrape up a squirrel.
We’re gonna have us a "roadkill omelette".
Aaah, back at ya.
[ Bill ] Hobbs, Roosevelt.
-Uh, it says here you’re from Detroit?
-Mm-hmm.
-What part?
-The part you drive through doin’ 85.
-Been there.
-Mm-hmm.
-Is anybody else from Detroit?
-Hoo-ah.
-Yeah.
Miranda Myers, it says Cleveland here.
Yeah, I lived there too. I lived in Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Miami, L.A.
-Seattle.
-Any particular reason?
My mother liked to drive.
-Sound like she liked that back seat kinda right too.
-Excuse me.
-[ Bill ] All right, all right.
-[ Groans ] Yo!
-Now, you deserved that.
-True.
-She hit harder than you, Haywood.
-[ Haywood ] Very funny.
Leroy Jackson.
Yes, sir. Um, but that’s
Jackson Leroy, sir.
Oh, sorry. It says here you play football.
-Yes, sir. Well, I--I did for a while.
-All-state.
-Yeah. Um--yeah.
-This boy was all-planet.
I seen him one time pick off a pass and go 90 yards through the other team like, bang.!
Left ‘em all on the field.
Dead. This boy got skill.!
Gimme some love, kid.
Two times. Go ahead, sit on down, Heisman boy.
You should a won the Heisman.
-What?
-Uh--
Brian Davis, Junior, sir.
Grand Forks, North Dakota.
-Hey, Bill. Ask him about his daddy.
-Yeah.
Shut up, Benitez!
-My daddy was the bravest and neatest soldier...
-[ Bill ] Hey.!
-in the whole wide world.
-Everybody shut up! God!
Um, Melvin, Mel.
Charlotte, North Carolina.
Melvin Melvin?
-[ Snoring Lightly ]
-Is he up?
Mel. He does this sometimes, Bill. Mel.
Hey, Bill, he was at the B.R.M. yesterday in the hole with his rifle, just like this.
-[ Snores ]
-And you’re--
Me? Montgomery, Jamaal, from Detroit, Michigan.
Jamaal, you mind letting these people speak for themselves?
How he gonna speak?
That boy droolin’ down his chest.
None of the others are.
You got a wise comment for everybody.
Bill, what’s the matter?
I’m tryin’ to help you. I’m your assistant. What’s what?
-Yeah, well you’re succeeding in bein’ an asshole.
-Aw, thank you!
Hey, he can’t do that.
You can’t do that. You can’t do that. You cannot do that.
-It says in the rule book--
-Thank you.
Shut up! No soldier shall be singled out for abusive mistreatment of any kind!
-That’s regulation.
Leroy, I want a new teacher.
-Shut up.
-Shut up?
-Shut up.
[ Bill ] All right, all right.
[ Sighs ] So much for attendance.
So, Mr. Rago, what are you gonna teach us?
That’s a good question.
Anybody got any ideas?
How ‘bout teachin’ somebody to get a job?
Uh--
Everybody will read something.
What?
Not for nothin’, I mean,
I don’t see any books.
Maybe you do, but I don’t.
-You know what I’m sayin’.
-All right.
Then we’ll all write something.
Would you hand these out for me?
-[ Benitez ] Hoo-ah.!
-Here you go. Thanks.
Um... start now and have these ready for the next class.
Uh, write about... why you’re here.
-This is where they told us to come.
-No.
I mean the magical twist of fate that prompted you to gravitate... toward this institute of imbeciles.
What?
Write why you joined the army.
Why I joined the army.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Montgomery ] I joined to be with you, Billy boy.
Do you want us to, like, write that at the top, sir?
W-Why I joined the army?
[ Sighs ]
-[ Bugle Playing Reveille ]
-[ Groans ]
[ Troops Shouting ]
-[ Bangs Table ]
-[ Groaning ]
[ Shouting Continues ]
What the heck’s goin’ on here?
What the heck is goin’ on at 4:30 in the morning?
[ Shouting Continues ]
I hate this place!
A bunch of banshees.!
What? You have to do this here?
On my lawn? Can’t you take it six blocks down the road?
What are you doin’ here?
Aw, that’s it. I can’t stand this job. I’m outta here.
Platoon, attention!
More P.T., Drill Sergeant!
More P.T.! We like it! We love it!
We want more of it! Make it hurt,
Drill Sergeant! Make it hurt! Hooo!
[ Bill ] Find me something.
I’ll do it for free. If they like it, they can pay me.
I’ll work nights. Nobody sleeps around here anyway.
No, no, no, you’re not listening to me,
Jack. You’re not listening.
Screw my pride! I’ll take anything.
I’ll write papers for your children.
Do you hear this?
[ Shouting Continues ]
It’s the sound of hell.
Seven... eight... nine... ten... eleven.
[ Troops Shouting ]
Go, Navy!
[ Grunts ]
[ Chattering ]
Eat your beans, Haywood.
-[ Chuckles ] Oh, why bother?
-Don’t, no, no.
Pay him no mind, Tommy Lee.
-You took it all. Now eat it all!
-Eat, eat, eat, eat.
You got more than me.
I could kick his ass.
I could kick his ass.
I could definitely kick his ass.
Double-D’s. Dumb as dogshit.
-[ Girls Laughing ]
-Dumb, huh?
Well, let me tell you somethin’.
I’d rather be a double-D... than a swinger from the ugly tree, you fat pig.
[ Girls ] Oooh!
[ Laughing ]
You’re bad.
Nice goin’, Myers.
-Swingin’ from the ugly tree? Damn.
-[ Laughs ]
[ Drill Sergeant ] Anything left on your plate, we’ll do extra push-ups.!
You know, Mel, cling peaches were my daddy’s favorite.
Gimme a break, will ya, Junior?
My daddy this.
My daddy that. How many freakin’ times do we have to hear about your daddy?
Eat! Eat! Eat!
Eat! Eat!
We eat now, we taste it later!
-Where did all this freakin’ food come from?
-Eat! Eat it!
-[ Chattering ]
-All right, who wants to start?
Nobody?
[ Snorts ] I thought this was the volunteer army.
You tryin’ to diss us? You can’t do that.
Leroy, tell him he can’t do that.
-Shut up, asshole.
-Naw, man, he’s dissin’ you.
Why you startin’ with me, inbred Jed?
Sit over there and shut up.
Montgomery, you finished? Is that the end of the intelligent repartee?
All right. Why don’t we begin with Haywood?
How come I got to go first?
Because you’re from
Wallahoochee, Georgia.
-[ Montgomery ] Get up there, boy.
-Willacoochee, Bill.
Willacoochee.
There’s these woods behind our trailer park.
This old guy lives in the woods there... and everybody in town swore he was crazy.
-""He showed me how to hunt...
-[ Yawning ] how to be real quiet and how to listen.
He said he had seen everything in the world there was to see.
And that’s why he never wanted to leave those woods.
Me and my daddy got laid off at the paper mill.
""Whilst I spent about five months watchin’ TV with my brothers...
I kept thinkin’ of what the old man said.
Finally, I decided that I did want to see more of the world... than what was behind that trailer park, so I joined up.
I liked living with my Aunt Mavis in Chicago the best.
But last summer, my mother Ruthie came back, and we drove to Atlanta.
She said we don’t have to stay long, but then she met a man and take off.
""I waited around for a while for her to come back... but everybody keeps sayin’ just go on home.
I don’t know where that is.
""So I take the bus to Cleveland and spend two days staring at the poster behind the driver... that said, Be All You Can Be.’
""So I think about that for a week... and then I think...
I gotta be somewhere, so here I am.
[ Montgomery ]
""In my crib... there ain’t never been a time when we eat, or sleep, or nothin’.
You know, everybody just runs around crazy. Half the time
I don’t even know who they are.
[ Scoffs ]
I must be the only person in the world to join the army... so he’d know exactly what time he was eatin’ lunch.
I wanted to learn a new trade.
-Sergeant Cass.
-Afternoon, sir.
-[ Bill ] Brian Davis, Junior.
-Sir, yes, sir.
[ Clears Throat ]
Why I joined the army...
I wanted to be in the army for as long as I can remember.
""I never really knew my dad ‘cause he died in Vietnam when I was a baby.
His name was Brian too.
My whole life my mama showed me pictures of him... and read me his letters and told me how he was a hero.
-Bullshit, man. He wasn’t no hero.
-He was so!
-How you gonna prove that?
You got no proof.
-Hey, hey, hey.
-[ Davis ] I don’t need proof.
-Get it through your thick skull.
Your daddy was no hero.
-[ Myers ] Shut up.!
-Read my lips. He’s selling you a dream.
-Would you knock it off and let him finish?
-[ Davis ] My mom told me.!
-[ Benitez ] Your mommy made it up.
-[ Haywood ] Cut it out.!
Go ahead.
She told me about how he was a hero.
He died for his country.
I think that if my daddy was alive today... he’d want me to be in the army too...
[ Crying ] so I could learn to be brave.
I’m sorry.
That’s okay. It’s all right.
Take it easy.
[ Clears Throat ] So, um--
I guess the real reason
I, I joined the army... was to get a better education so I could get a better job.
And that’s why. ‘"
When I was a kid, I used to love summers ‘cause there was no school.
[ Montgomery Laughs ]
"I had to baby-sit my kid sister, but I didn’t mind too much.
I mean, we’d fight a lot but, you know, mostly we just used to kid around.
She wanted to be a dancer.
She was pretty good too.
One day a couple of summers ago, I sent her up to the store to buy some milk.
Now, the bullet was meant for the dude comin’ out of the store...
""I still miss her a lot, but I always miss her more in the summer.
After that I decided that being part of a gang didn’t seem like such a good idea.
So I joined this gang.
That good enough, Mr. Rago?
Yeah.
-[ Man ] How you doin’, sir?
-Let’s have a coin check.
[ Bill ] Can I have a Dewars, please, with seven aspirin back?
-Seven aspirin? You okay?
-Catch you later.
Yeah. Oh, Jesus.
I mean, some of the stories these kids have. I can’t--I can’t believe it.
It’s really somethin’, huh?
Everybody’s got a story.
You wanna hear my story, Bill?
[ People Chattering ]
Not now, Tom. Some other time.
Well, you know what I think?
What’s that, Tom?
You see, after their families let ‘em down, they go to what’s left of their schools.
The teachers are underpaid.
They’re scared, so they stop teaching.
But that doesn’t stop ‘em from handing out high school diplomas like they were toilet paper.
So that means we gotta take ‘em.
Country better shape up soon, though.
We’re going to hell in a handcart. But that’s strictly between you and me, right?
Yeah. [ Knocking Bar]
Could I have my aspirin, please?
[ Drill Sergeant ]
Swing up and stand on--No.!
-Stand on the log! You ready to quit?
You ready to quit?
-No!
-No, Drill Sergeant!
-Get the hell back up there!
This is not that complicated.
Forty-one, Drill Sergeant.
No, Private, it’s not 41 .
You’re reading the wrong numbers. Read the red numbers.
-One, two, three--
-[ Groans ]
-You’ve got to be kiddin’ me.
-No, Drill Sergeant.
Three weeks, motor mouth.
Three weeks, you have yet to show me a real push-up.
-I expect to get this one pretty good.
-They’ve all got to be good!
Two fingers. That’s what it’s supposed to be, two fingers.
-Understand that, Private Myers?
-Yes, Drill Sergeant.
[ Drill Sergeant ] Keep movin’, Benitez.
All the way to the end. Don’t stop.!
Come on, get back to the line! Go back to the start of the line! Hurry up!
You’re gonna make it, Benitez.
All right, time’s up.
Who wants to talk about what they read?
-Benitez, come on up here.
-All right.
[ Chuckles ]
-What are you readin’? Okay.
-Archie comic.
I mean, what’s up with Jughead?
Archie’s got Betty.
And you got Reggie with Veronica.
I mean, what’s up with Jughead?
In my neighborhood, it didn’t matter how ugly you were, you always had a girl.
I don’t know what’s the matter with this guy. Another thing, you guys maybe could help me.
-Mr. Rago, hold on a sec.
Uh, here it is.
-[ Groans ]
Come on, Archie, let’s go to the malt shoppe. “What the hell’s a malt shop-ee”?
-[ Montgomery ] Benitez.
-What’s a malt shop-ee? You guys know?
Bring your stupid ass over here.
-What’s the matter with you?
-What do you mean?
-What are you doin’ readin’ a comic book?
-He said bring anything.
-I bought a comic book.
I like comic books.
-Knock it off.
-You’re here for education, not to read comic books.
-You’re embarrassing me, boy.
-That’s stupid.
-You could a got something else at the P.X.
-Yeah, like Batman or Superman or Spider-Man.
-Come on, shut up!
-[ Benitez ] They scare me.
-[ Sighs ]
-[ Montgomery Laughs ]
-Bunch of hyenas.
-What’s the book you got, Mr. Rago?
-This?
-Yeah.
-This is called Hamlet.
Hamlet. Yo, that’s about a little-bitty pig, right?
No, it ain’t about a little-bitty pig!
What’s it about, Billy boy?
It’s about... sex... murder, incest...
-insanity.
-Ohhh.
-Shoot. Beats the hell out of this garbage I’m readin’.
-Guns.
Sure does. Pretty much beats the heck out of any book ever written.
-All right, Leroy.
-Yeah?
-What are you readin’?
-Uh, Sports Illustrated. The
Faces in the Crowd section.
Why don’t you tell us more about your book? Sounds more interesting.
Yeah, who wrote it?
Well, it was written by William Shakespeare.
You ever hear of Shakespeare?
-I heard of him. That guy’s in
Central Park every summer.
-Dude must’ve got mugged a lot.
He’s been dead for almost 400 years.
-See that? They killed him.
They killed him. New Yorkers.
-Yeah, yeah.
He wrote plays.
Plays. You know, like TV.
Without the box.
Mmm.
They didn’t have any TVs back then or movies.
Or that many books even.
So everybody went to the theater.
Everybody.
Kings, queens, right down to the working stiffs.
-Why don’t you read us some of that?
-Word.
Skip to the page with some incest so we can make Haywood feel at home. Sooey!
No, you guys don’t want to hear about Hamlet.
What? What? What?
I guess we’re not smart enough.
-No, no, no, no. It’s just very,
I don’t know, it’s--
-[ Montgomery ] Here we go.
-What? It’s just what?
-It’s complicated.
So? We’re here. We’re listenin’.
[ Clears Throat ]
Sit down.
Okay, okay.
All right, here’s the deal. Um--
Hamlet is, uh... uh, he’s a prince.
All right. And, uh...
-and he’s away at college.
-[ Montgomery ] Rich kid.
Right? And he, he gets word that his father died.
-Oh, no, Davis, please, don’t start cryin’.
-Leave me alone, Benitez!
-Forget about it.
-Benitez, shut up, all right?
-Chill.
-Go ahead.
All right, so he comes home from college for the funeral.
And when he gets back, everything’s fishy.
All right?
You ever hear of the term, something is rotten in the state of Denmark?
Naw, but in apartment 3-C, my building, Miss Leary... every Thursday, she always cooks the corned beef and cabbage.
-Mm-hmm.
-Something sure smells rotten in the state of New York.
All right.
That’s the same kind of thing.
-That was dumb. That was really dumb.
-Leave him alone, man.
He gets back, and he’s in mourning... and less than a month goes by and his mother gets remarried.
-Damn.
-To his uncle.
-[ Everybody Gasps ]
-That’s the incest part.
Okay? So, now, Hamlet spends the rest of the play trying to decide... whether he’s got the guts to go after his uncle the king... and avenge his father’s death, or if he wants to just... go with the flow and do what his mother is tellin’ him to do.
-Naw.
-Don’t go out like that.
So, where I am in the play,
[ Clears Throat ]
He’s with his mother and the king and she’s trying to cheer him up.
And she says...
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off... and let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not forever with thy veiled lids seek for thy noble father...
-in the dust.
-[ Montgomery ] What?
-Hey, you wanna lay that down one more time?
-Please.
Well, it’s--it’s really easy.
You just gotta listen, all right?
Cast thy nighted color off.
Well, what color do we wear at a funeral?
-Black.
-Black!
-A nighted color.
-She’s tellin’ him not to wear black, to stop mourning.
-[ Bill ] Right?
-[ Hobbs ] Right.
It says, Let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Which means she’s sayin’ don’t glare at me as though you hate me.
Why should he? His father’s body’s not cold yet and she’s given the punnani to UncleJoe.
Something like that.
Only it’s Uncle Claudius.
-What the hell is a punnani?
-[ Montgomery ] Cave boy never heard of punnani.
Hey, Mr. Bill, when my daddy split on my mama, he moved in... with her sister, who is, of course, my auntie.
And I got a baby cousin who’s also my baby sister.
That’s sort of the same thing.
Mel speaks.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Applause, Whistling ]
-Glad to have you, Mel.
-I got a question.
-Yes?
-Now, if look like a friend means don’t hate me... why don’t she say don’t hate me?
-Because it’s poetry.
-But it don’t even rhyme, yo?
Yeah, but it’s like, you know, uh--
It’s language. It’s trying to put things together that evoke... a certain--
It sounds better.
What do you mean?
I mean, it doesn’t sound like anything to me. I don’t get it.
Yeah. Come on, Teach, teach us.
It’s--all right.
It’s a simile.
-A what?
-A simile. All right, here.
-[ Benitez ] A simile.
-Yeah.
[ Montgomery ] That’s a little yellow face with a smile on it.
Um--
-[ Melvin ] Si-mi-le.
-Simile.
It’s, uh... when you take two things... that, um... don’t seem alike... but in a way, they are.
-Huh?
-[ Leroy ] Hmm?
All right. All right, we’re lookin’ for a simile. Haywood.
Um...you’re, uh--
You’re workin’ in the mill and, uh... you come home or you’re on your way home.
You go to a bar, you stop for a brew. Down at the end of the bar is a beautiful woman.
And she winks at you.
All right?
You go to her like--fill in the blank.
-[ Mumbling ] I don’t know.
-Like a rooster with an itch!
[ Class Chuckles ]
Like a rooster with an itch.
Way to go, Davis.
You gotta love those barnyard similes.
All right, that was simile.
Now, here’s somethin’ else. A metaphor.
-All men are--
-Dogs.
Dogs! Okay, you got it?
Simile: like dogs.
Well, here’s metaphor.
We just plain are... dogs.
Okay? All right.
Now, this is a good one here.
-All right, let’s see.
-[ Writing On Chalkboard ]
-Oxymoron.
-[ Montgomery ] Hold up.
Hold up, hold up. You can’t do that.
That is a diss. I ain’t no oxmoron.
No, no, no, no.
Not oxmoron, schmuck. Oxymoron.
It’s when you take two words that are totally the opposite and you jam ‘em together.
All right? Like, uh... military intelligence.
Dark victory.
Thunderous silence.
Hmm?
Girly-man.
-[ Class Chuckling ]
-He talkin’ about you, Benitez.
-[ Benitez ] You’re killin’ me.
-Okay. So, let’s end the class with, uh... an oxymoron from Shakespeare himself,
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
If you say so.
-Take it easy, Billy boy. Two times.
-[ Leroy ] Fall in outside.
-Thanks, Mr. Bill. See you tomorrow.
-Hoo-ah.
Thanks, Mr. Rago. That was neat.
-Take care, Bill.
-Take it easy, Rocko.
I’m teachin’ Shakespeare.
[ Chuckles ]
That is, uh,
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
All right.
Readin’ Hamlet to the double-D’s.
Come on!
-I’ve been waitin’ for this!
-[ Troops Shouting ]
-Beat him down! Let’s go!
-Kick his ass!
Come on!
[ Grunts ]
[ Helicopter Passing Overhead ]
-Hey! Hey!
-Huh?
You must be Bill.
-Yeah, that’s me.
-Yeah.
-You don’t seem to mind them calling you that. Okay if I do the same, Bill?
-No problem.
Bill, I’d appreciate it if you’d employ a bit more discipline in your classroom.
Would that be too much to ask?
I mean, this isn’t Harvard yard.
This is a military--
-Whoa, whoa, Lou, take it easy.
-Who the fuck is Lou?
What’s your problem? I’m just walkin’ here. You got a bug up your ass?
You know what I think, Bill?
I think your whole class thing is a bunch of bullshit.
-I think you’re wastin’ my time.
-Your time?
-That’s right.
-It’s their class. I don’t see you in the class, so lighten up.
Their time is my time, Bill.
Now, I have exactly 54 days to teach these young kids... what it takes to save lives in combat, in combat, Bill!
Now, I don’t think they’re gonna learn that... writing a bunch of touchy-feely little papers for the English teacher. No.
They’re gonna learn that out here with me! I’m gonna be certain of that.
Now, that’s my mission, Bill.
And I can handle it ‘cause it’s my job.
Yeah, well, you do your job and I’ll do mine.
You know what the difference here,
Bill, is? I care about what I do.
[ Troops Continue Shouting ]
Do him, Haywood.
-[ Class Chattering ]
-Lady and gentlemen, it’s show time!
[ Montgomery ]
Oh, show time at the Apollo.
-What’s this?
-This is Hamlet.
I figured that since we have to do something, we might as well do something that I love... and that you showed a little bit of interest in, so... here.
-Put your desks in a circle facing each other.
-[ Chattering ]
You mean you want us to read this stuff?
Yeah, Benitez, even you could do it.
-Plus, it cost me nine bucks to run those things off.
-Billy boy, it says here...
""Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven... uh, whiles--Willis, like... the puffed and reckless “libertinay”.
-Libertine!
-Libertine. Hey, yo.
-You gonna come translate this for us?
-Why? It’s in English.
-Uh-uh.
-Now... Roosevelt Hobbs...
-you be Hamlet.
-All right.
Benitez, you’re gonna be
Hamlet’s best friend, Horatio.
-That’s cool, bro.
-Okay, Miranda Myers, you will be...
-Hamlet’s girlfriend, the fair Ophelia.
-She ain’t exactly fair.
-Quiet. Melvin!
-[ Hobbs ] Mighty fair to me.
Melvin! Mel.
Melvin, when you wake up, you will be Polonius, Ophelia’s father.
-Leroy. You’ll be
Ophelia’s brother, Laertes.
-Right.
-Montgomery, you’re the ghost.
-The who?
-The ghost.
-[ Haywood Chuckles ]
You the ghost in the hood.
[ Mimicking Haywood ]
You the ghost in the hood. Goo-ooh.
-[ Blabbering ]
-[ Sighs ]
Haywood...
-you’re the king.
-Thank you, Bill.
-Damn, I should have been the king.
-Davis.
You will be Queen Gertrude,
Hamlet’s mother.
-[ Class Laughing ]
-Sir, isn’t that a woman’s part?
-Alas, Private Davis, we have but one woman in our class.
-One.
But, sir, I’d really prefer another part.
Relax, Davis.
You’ll be reassured to know... that in Shakespeare’s day, all the parts were played by men.
-What?
-Yeah. That’s right.
-Romeo and Juliet were a couple of guys?
-Correctamundo.
Bill, you know as well as I do a guy playing a girl is plain filthy!
Especially if it’s gonna be my wife.
-That’s your woman.
-[ Haywood ] Shut up, Leroy.!
Oh, they say Jove laughs.
Oh, gentle Romeo.
""If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won, I’ll frown.
And be perverse.
And say thee nay.
So thou wilt woo.
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond, and therefore... thou mayst think my behavior light.
But trust me, gentle man.
I’ll prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange.
Hmm.
I should have been more strange.
I should have been more strange,
I must confess.
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware, my true love passion.
Therefore, pardon me, and not impute this yielding to light love.
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
You know, that shade of blue really brings out your eyes.
-[ Laughing ] See?
-[ Class Laughing ]
-Hoo-ah.
-No problem. All right.
[ Troops Yelling ]
Let’s go, ladies. Come on.
-That’s it, Baby Huey. Come on.!
-Move it!
Do not saw the air too much with your aim thus.
[ Troops Yelling ]
[ Shouting ]
No, no, no, no.
Gimme that.
-You step in and then step in with the right foot.
-All right, Drill Sergeant.
So, what Hamlet’s father, the ghost, is tellin’ him... that because he was killed... poisoned in his sleep in the afternoon... with his sins still on his soul... that he can’t get a pass straight to heaven.
All right, soldiers. Close your eyes and break the seal of the mask.
-Do it!
-Keep your mouth closed...
-and do not inhale the gas under any circumstances.
-Drill Sergeant.
Too easy, Drill Sergeant!
[ Coughs, Gagging ]
[ Grunting ]
All right, good, Melvin. See how good it is when you stay awake?
Hamlet’s confronted his mother, and she knows deep down in her soul... she’s gonna have these stains forever on her soul.
That’s deep, man.
Stains on her soul.
-Way deep. Right?
-Mm-hmm.
[ Troops Shouting ]
Queen Gertrude.
[ Drill Sergeant ] Yeah. Yeah.
Too easy, Hobbs, eh?
Neither... a borrower... nor a lender bef---before--"
No. For loan oft...
"Ioses both... itself and friend.
"And borrowing...
"dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all, to... thine own self be true.
Melvin. All right, Melvin.
Stop. You can say the rest when you come out of the coma.
Sit down. Look, look.
You gotta, you gotta say it... to a beat, you know?
-Does anybody play the drums?
-[ Together] Hoo-ah.
-Both of ya?
-Mmm.
Whack this out on the desk.
Bop, bada, bop, bada, bop-bop-bop-bop.
Da, dada, dat, dada, dat-dat-dat-dat.
Da, dada, dat, dada, dat-dat-dat-dat.
Come on, Haywood, get with it.
Give him time.
He’s a white boy.
Da, dada, dat, dada, dat-dat-dat-dat.
You see, you say the lines to the beat. And you--you hear it?
Um, do I hear ‘em bangin’ on the desk?
No, this, fool! Bop, bada, bop, bada, bop-bop-bop-bop.
This above-- Get up.
This above all, to thine own self be true. Say it.
This above all, to thine own self be true.
[ Everybody ] This above all, to thine own self be true.
This above all, to thine own self be true.
This above all, to thine own self be true.
This above all, to thine own self be true.
-This above all, to thine own self be true.

-Makes me happy
-Makes me feel fine
-Makes me feel fine
[ Haywood ]
Don’t you tell my heart
-My achy-breaky heart
-[ Groans ] That’s cruel.
-Whoo!
-[ Hobbs ] Damn, Haywood.!
Oh, if you tell my heart
My achy-breaky heart
I just don’t think he’ll understand
-[ Hobbs ] Davis is thinking about his daddy again.
-I’ll cheer him up.
Hey, Davis, you should a seen me in there.
[ Imitating De Niro ]
Never got me down, Ray. Ya hear me?
-Never got me down, Ray.
-Who’s that?
Jake LaMotta.
-Who?
-You never seen the movie Raging Bull?
-No, I missed that.
-You crazy?
[ As De Niro ] Hey, Larry! Who’s an animal, Larry, huh?
Your mother’s an animal! I’m gonna eat your dog for breakfast, Larry!
-Ya hear me, Larry?
-You’re an animal.
What? I’m an animal?
What are you, crazy?
Huh? I’m not an animal!
-I’m not an animal!
-Stop!
-Please stop. Stop.
-Okay.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
-All right, I got mail call!

Ho! We got Ben.
We got Bartol.

-[ Men ] Aw.!
Sorry, man.
Davis ain’t gettin’ no letter, Junior?
Look, I got one.
I ain’t got a letter yet.
You gotta read that to me.
-Has anybody seen my green socks?
-We all got green socks.!
Let’s see what he has to say.
How ya doin’. How ya’ doin’.
How ya doin’.
Let’s see, uh--
Oh, listen. Dad put new holleys on the Camaro... so he could race it up at the speedway.
It was runnin’ like greased owl shit.
Hey, that’s a simile, Mel.
That is a simile, ain’t it?
Damn right.
Let’s see. Then Toby drove it last week and threw a rod... and Dad got mad and threw him down the stairs.
This ain’t my real dad.
This is my step dad.
Things are sure different... now that you’re in the marines.
-Marines?
-Well, he’s 1 2.
He gets ‘em mixed up, ya know. so I guess he’s startin’ in on his real kids.
Mel, what kind of Camaro has he got?
A Z-28?
Mel. You okay, Mel?
Mel?
[ Sighs ] I ain’t never gonna hit my kids.
Oh, don’t start sleepin’ again, Mel.
You know it ain’t gonna solve nothin’.
[ Sighs ]
-Mama, mama, don’t you cry
-Mama, mama, don’t you cry
-Little boy ain’t gonna die
-Your little boy ain’t gonna die
-Oh! Aw, jeez!
-What’s the matter? Heart attack?
-It’s the food, I’m tellin’ you.
-Oh, Jesus!
Junior, where you goin’?
-I gotta go back.!
-We’re gonna be late! Junior!
Oh, no! Oh, no, no!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
-What?
-Wait, wait, wait!
-Jesus.
-What’s your freakin’ problem, Davis?
-My bag! My daddy’s bracelet!
-His what?
-It’s a Montagnard bracelet.
He got it in Vietnam.
-He wore a bracelet?
Lots of soldiers wore ‘em over there.
I left it in my shirt pocket.
Good, now it’ll be clean.
Come on. Let’s go.
Come on, man!
What if it gets lost?
Please, you gotta help me, man.
It’s all I got.
We gotta get this to the quartermaster’s laundry on time.
[ Imitating Al Pacino ] I don’t care.
Look for the bracelet, okay?
-All right. What’s his name?
-His name is Brian Davis, Jr.
-Come on, man. This is stupid.
-[ As Pacino ] Shut up, you!
I kill you, you cockroach!
Shut up!
Now look. I gotta touch the dirty clothes, man? You kiddin’ me.
Please, please.
Yes! Yes!
Here it is.
Oh, man, thank you. Thank you!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... four, three, two, one!
Freeze! I said freeze!
What was that again?
What time is it?
Drill Sergeant!
Breakfast is at 0600, Drill Sergeant!
Zero six hundred.
That’s correct.
Which by my reckoning has come and gone, has it not?
-Drill Sergeant.! Yes, Drill Sergeant.!
-Hi, Miranda.
[ Cass ] I don’t know. Maybe it’s me.
I just can’t seem to hear ya.
I don’t hear that--
Benitez! Davis!
Front and center.!
You wouldn’t happen to have the time, would you, Private?
Sorry, Drill Sergeant.
Slight problem with the laundry.
Does this building look like a Denny’s to you, New York? Huh?
Show me where it says breakfast served anytime.
Get on down there and push ten.
Who was I talkin’ to?
Was I talkin’ to you?
Drill Sergeant, I asked him to help me find my daddy’s bracelet.
-My daddy! My daddy!
-My daddy sent it--
Your daddy ain’t here, son, and your daddy can’t help you.
I don’t know if anybody can help you, high-speed.
Lou. Lou, go easy on the kid.
What?
He’s five minutes late.
I mean, talk about anal. You must’ve been toilet-trained at gunpoint.
[ Stifles Chuckle ]
Come over here.
Come over here.
-What?
-Come over here. Right here!
-Take it easy.
-Don’t ever interrupt me when
I’m talkin’ to my soldiers.
-He was five minutes late.
-You understand me?
Man, you been on my bad side since the day I laid eyes on you.
You better comprehend this.
You better get this down...
-’cause I have had it with your smug college-boy attitude.
-Yeah?
You listen to me: stay away from me.
And don’t you ever, ever impugn my authority in front of my soldiers.
-Now, you got that, man?
-Yeah, I got that.
-You got it?
That’s point-blank and period.
-Yeah, I got it.
[ Muttering ]
For the rest of the week, you’ll show up here nine minutes early.
-You will report here--
-Davis.
Just show up to my class nine minutes late is all, ya see? No problemo.
-Oh, that’s it! That is it!
-What?
-Drill Sergeant!
Drill Sergeant! Calm down.
-What?
Who do you think you are?
You gonna tell me what to do?
-You’re nothin’. You’re nothin’.
-I’m nothin’?
Did you hear what he said?
I’m nothin’.!
-Come on. Come on. Right here.
-Just let me--
[ Knocking ] Sir?
So they finally sent you to the principal’s office.
Yeah.
Man could’ve killed you, Mr. Rago.
He would’ve been court-martialed, but he could’ve killed you.
-He started it.
-I don’t know what happened, and I don’t care.
All I care about is this program...
Okay.
You never served in the military, did you, Mr. Rago?
No, my military experience is limited to the day... that I walked for hours in the rain from Arlington Cemetery... to the White House carrying the name of a soldier... who died needlessly in Vietnam.
Do you remember the soldier’s name?
No.
Do me a favor, Bill.
Whatever your personal views are, while you’re here... remember you are a guest of the United States Army, okay?
Okay.
From now on, by the book.
Dismissed.
By the book.
[ Softly ] What am I doin’ here?
Spud duds. Spud duds.
Potato topping for the whole family.
Hmm.
- [ Hobbs ] How late is he now?
- [ Myers ] He’s very late.
What difference does it make?
- Damn.
- Why would he do this?
[ Montgomery ] Check it out.!
We got us a substitute teacher.!
[ Benitez ] He looks just like Mel.
Bring it here.
Which one is the dummy?
Melvin. Wake up, Mel.
Time for school, Mel.
[ Montgomery ] So how long are we supposed to hang around?
[ Benitez ] Maybe he got sick or something.
- Oh.
- [ Hobbs ] Here comes the excuse.
Sorry I’m late.
The traffic really stunk.
- Traffic. Whoo! See?
- Ya ever notice when you’re in a hurry... they radio-dispatch all people to drive in front of ya?
It’s ridiculous. Okay.
So where were we?
[ Montgomery ]
Where were we? We were here.
[ Recruits ]
Uh-huh.
Give me a break, will ya?
I had something important.
- That’s all right. We’re used to it.
- [ Benitez ] That’s for sure.
- It was a job interview, for cripes’ sake.
- [ Myers ] A what?
- Job interview?
I thought this was your job.
- Mm-mmm.
- We’re part time, like a paper route.
- Aw, come on.
- Hey, what do ya want from me?
- Not much, I guess.
- Huh?
- Yeah, we got a victory tower at 1 7 00, sir.
- Everybody fall in outside.
- I don’t believe you guys.!
- You stay and listen.
- We ain’t nothin’ but a hobby to you.
Hey, Davis, we’d better go.
We might get stuck behind some old people.
You guys are never late, right, Benitez?
[ Haywood ] Last time I come to this damn class.
I got 1 5 minutes left!
I stood up for you, Davis.! Oh, sure.
Go ahead, go.
Aw, to hell with ‘em.
[ Grunts ]
If I lose ‘em now, I’ll never get ‘em back. Damn!

- Shakespeare, what’re ya doin’ here?
- Hold on a second, Lou.
- All right, I was late. Big deal.
You gotta give me a break.
- Rago.
- This is important, Lou.
- No. No, Bill. This is important. This.
This is why we’re here.
This is what we’re here to do. Go!
Come down from there! Leroy!
Hobbs, I got 1 5 minutes left, and I want ‘em.!
- I don’t think they want to talk to you, Bill.
- Montgomery!
Montgomery, get down here.!
I don’t even think they can hear you.
Come on, Davis.
Do this one for daddy.! Make him proud.!
You know, from down here.
- Hey, wait a minute!
-Just hold up, Drill Sergeant.
Can’t just quit. Ohh!
That’s what you been doin’ all your lives.
Davis.! Hold it.! Hold it.!
Don’t go nowhere.
Hold it. Whoa.
Okay, you guys got problems.
- Well, so do I, goddammit.!
- Move! Move, Davis! Keep moving!
Mr. Rago, you’re gonna make me fall!
- What the hell are you lookin’ at?
- Aah!
[ Cass ] Great, Oswald.!
You don’t want to end up like him.!
- Rago, have you gone crazy?
- [ Cass ] Montgomery, keep moving.!
Montgomery, where ya goin’?

- [ Cass ] That’s it.!
- Hold it!
Davis!
Hold it!

- All right? Now go down.
- Do any of you have the slightest idea...
- what it’s like to have mortgages...
- [ Recruit ] Get him. doctor bills, alimony payments?
Wait’ll you have your kids.
Then you talk to me about priorities.
Then you tell me what it’s like to have a little cash flow.
- What the hell are you doing?
- You got up here.
Now you gotta get down.
- Get on your knees for safety, sir.
- Huh? Jeez.
Ohh.
Oh. That’s far.
Baby Huey, show Shakespeare how we get down from the victory tower.!
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

Too easy, Drill Sergeant.
Your turn, Rago!

- What’ll it be?
- Yeah. All right.
Okay. Come on.
Let’s go! Let’s go!
- You do not want to do this.
- I’m doin’ it. Let’s go.
You do not want to do this, sir.
You’re clippin’ him?
- Watch the jewels. Ooh.
- Clippin’ him. He wants to do it.
- [ Bill ] All right.
- Put on the gloves, Mr. Rago.
All right. Get down. Get down.
You’re gonna swing your legs over the edge of the platform.
Reach your foot down and find that ledge.
- [ Cass ] Come on, Rago.!
- [ Hobbs ] There’s a ledge.
- No ledge! No ledge!
- There’s a ledge. A ledge right there.
- Okay.
- Come on. Get your foot on it.

All right, now. Just lean back.
- [ Grunting ]
- Okay, first thing: don’t look down.

Everybody looks down when you tell ‘em not to look down! You know that!
All right. All right.
Look, just lean back, relax.
Okay? Everything’s gonna be all right.
I got the rope up here, and there’s a guy down there with the other end.
Come on. Relax. Just lean back.
Get the rope. There you go.
All right.
You all right down there, man?
Come on, Mr. Bill. No sweat.
Melvin! He’ll be asleep before I reach the ground!
He’s not gonna be asleep.
He’s gonna be all right.
Just trust me, man.
- All right. The victory tower is yours.
- Ohh--
-Just let the rope slide.
- Whoa!

- Good work. Come on. Here we go.

[ Groaning ]
[ Davis ] Mr. Rago, put your feet up.! Ow.!
Feet up.! Watch those jewels you mentioned, Mr. Rago.
Turn around the other way!
Turn it around!

[ Benitez ] Take it easy, Mr. Rago.
Don’t look down.
- Pull me up! Pull me up!
- Whoa.! Whoa.! Whoa.!

Don’t worry, I got you.!
Don’t let go, Mel!

- Flap your little wings.!
- Come on!
- [ Benitez ] Uh-oh, the ball’s dropping.!
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Benitez ] Happy New Year.!
- [ Whooping ]
- All right! Way to go, Rago!
- [ Whistling ]
- Good work. I knew you had it in you, Mr. Bill.
Not bad for an old man, huh?
[ Applause, Whistling Continues ]
Tomorrow, 1 600 hours, right?
[ Together]
Hoo-ah!
- Hoo-ah’s right.
- Good work, Mr. Bill.
Go, boy. Loosen up them ropes.
He’s the man.
Ohhh.
- You should’ve wore a glove.
- I did wear a glove.
Oh.
[ Laughs ]
I wish I could’ve been there.
The guys must be so proud of you.
Yeah. I’ll remember that when they’re fittin’ me for a new hand.
Huh?
[ Laughs ] That’s what my kid keeps askin’ me.
You have a kid?
Yeah. Emily.
She wants to be an astronomer.
Go figure.
Go figure what? What?
[ Groans ]
All right. Let’s start swallowing and digesting.
- [ Recruits ] Hoo-ah, hoo-ah.!
- Come on, Tommy Lee.
More victory tower, Drill Sergeant.
I like it. I love it.
I want more of it.
- [ Rago ] Make it hurt, Drill Sergeant.!
- Way to go, Mr. Rago.
- Good work, Mr. Bill.
- All right.
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No, please.
[ Haywood ] Damn, Bill, you done tore that tower down.!
Whew!
- So what happened, anyway?
- What?
Two-ten. Nothin’ but muscle.
Star fullback.
College scouts must’ve been tossin’ hookers through your bedroom window.
Yeah, yeah. Just about.
I busted my knee my senior year.
I mean, I can push on it a little bit now, but--
Well, let’s just say it blew my shot.
Oh.
Isn’t there somethin’ else you can do?
No, there’s nothin’ else for me to do.
I was black and I played ball.
That’s all anybody ever cared about.
They didn’t teach me anything, but, oh, they kept passin’ me.
- Mmm.
- So I’m here, you know?
My wife works on the post here
‘cause we got a baby comin’.
Leroy, Jr.? Great!
Kid’ll probably come out wearin’ a helmet, get the Heisman.
I’m keepin’ that kid as far away from the playin’ field as I can.
Runnin’ a football never helped nobody pass a civil service exam.
Least ways, it never helped me.
Excuse me.
Hey, Leroy.
Ya ever hear of a guy named
Leonbattista Alberti?
Yeah, yeah. He played for the 49ers, right?
Nah. He played for the 1 400s.
The renaissance.
- The what?
- He’s what you’d call a renaissance man.
The guy was an architect, a writer, a painter, a musician... a scholar-- god knows what else.
But you know what
I remember most about him?
They say that he could stand with his feet together like this... and spring straight over a man’s head.
- Re-- Really?
- Yeah.
If Leonbattista Alberti couldn’t have done that...
I wouldn’t have remembered a thing about him.
So he was sort of like a smart jock, then, right?
That’s right. You got it.
Now, ain’t that an oxymoron?
- That is. That is.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- [ Laughing ]
- Give me some. All right.
- Talk to you later, Mr. Rago.
- All right.
The real question is, is Ophelia right?
Is Hamlet crazy?
Hobbs.
I don’t know. I think he’s just playin’ the fool.
Go on.
Well, it’s like he says.
Denmark’s a prison.
Everybody’s watchin’ him all the time, spyin’ on him.
If he thinks Denmark’s a prison, all he gotta do is move to a trailer park.
Tiny little rooms, six brothers and sisters.
I couldn’t even take a whiz by myself.
Gets to you, man.
It can make you crazy.
Imagine all your life waitin’, growin’ up hopin’...
- a tornado would come and whoosh you out of there.
- [ Recruits Laughing ]
That’s not what I’m sayin’, man.
What I’m sayin’ is that
Hamlet’s actin’ crazy for a reason.
To give him some time to think... to plan his next move... keep his eye on everybody else.
You sure you’re readin’ the same play?
Smart move, Benitez.
Uh... all right. That’s it.
Okay? Let’s call it quits for today.
- Hoo-ah.
- Hoo-ah.
[ Leroy ] Fall in outside.
First aid today.
So how’d you get to be so smart, huh?
- Told you, girl.
I been around. I seen things.
- Hobbs.
- Yeah.
- What’s the deal, man?
Deal?
Where’d you go to school?
Well, lots of places.
- You ever read this stuff before?
- [ Chuckles ] Nah.
Whew. Well, stick with it.
You’re doin’ fine.
He who increases knowledge, increases sorrow.’’
[ Whispering ]
Increases sorrow.
Increases sorrow. Shakespeare?
Mm-mmm, the Bible.
Even Shakespeare has his superior. Tch!
[ Leroy ]
Let’s go, Hobbs.!
Forward march.!
Look, is there any way you guys could have made a mistake with this kid?
[ Laughing ]
Us? Make a mistake?
I’m telling you, he doesn’t belong in there.
He belongs in, uh, lieutenant training school or something.
You think I can wave a wand and send this kid to West Point?
Rago, come on.
I got guys sleepin’ in the rafters.
I got a flood in the laundry.
I just got a call from the motor pool tellin’ me they lost an A.P.C.
They lost it.! The thing’s the size of a tank.! How could they lose it?
It’s a machine, Captain. This is a human being I’m talkin’ about.
This is a smart kid, as good as they come.
Damn it, Bill, it is just not that easy!
All right. Roosevelt Hobbs.
He deserves a shot.
Hobbs.
- [ Recruits ]  To be or not to be
- You got no rhythm.
- [ Laughs ] Ba-da-da! There!
-  To be or not to be
- [ Davis ] We gotta sing at the same time?
- [ Myers ] Yeah. Of course.
- Whatta ya think I’m trying to show you?
-  Or not to be
- [ Laughter ]
- [ Melvin ] Hey, hey.! Here he comes.!
- Hurry up.! Everybody get ready.!
- [ Hobbs ] Are you ready?

Let it be to be or not to be
M.C. Hobbs on the job rippin’ rhymes like the mob
The shit’s iller than Cape Fear the Shakespeare saga
Started with this prince kid his moms and his father
By his brother man now his brother’s king lover man
Actin’ real trite he took his brother’s life
For his green and to sex up his queen
But the prince, he ain’t goin’ for it he’s out for revenge
His pop’s ghost told him
Damn it, Hamlet, those are your ends
So just chill and cool for now
P-P-Play the fool until ya take him out
‘Cause all eyes is on you
So one way or the other
It’s a kamikaze style or do it undercover
But either way ya gotta slay-ah so what the hey-ah
So strap on your black and get set for the payback
Ain’t got no gat but he’s sportin’ a tool
Strappin’a sword for the Laertes duel
‘Cause he’s tryin’ to blame Hamlet for his sister’s death
But she took her own last breath
She ain’t got shh left
Never heard yet a more absurd set
Of circumstances murder and romances
-  So
- Incest, we had to put it to rest
We had time to manifest
He stuck the dagger in the king’s chest
To be or not to be
The double-D M.C.s is lettin’ it be
Let be to be or not to be
-  The double-D M.C.s is lettin’ it be

- [ Man On P.A.] Fire.!

- Breathe, Haywood.
- [ Console Beeping ]
- [ Gunshots Continue ]
- [ Davis ] Damn, Haywood.!
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
Drill Sergeant!
No problem, Drill Sergeant! Too easy!
- Outstanding, Haywood.
- [ Gunshots Continue ]
What ya need to get is a Winchester
.30-30 like my pa got.
Ain’t nothin’ that can touch that rifle.
You know, you could pick off a deer at about 1 50 yards away... but that’s open-sight, mind you.
Don’t get no Winchester .30-30.
Get yourself a Galil, an Israeli assault rifle. All right?
You can stick on twin banana clips... pump out 60 rounds in three seconds.
- That’s what I’m talkin’ about.
- Right? Yeah.
- That’s pretty good.
- Yeah, that’s a lot of deer, I guess.
Lot of deer.
Right face.!
- At ease!
- Carry on!
Go on, man.
- Straight ahead, sir.
- Which one, Sergeant?
[ Whispering ] He’s comin’ to get me.
He’s comin’ to get me. Ahem.
[ Murdoch ]
Put down your tray, son.
[ Shouting Orders ]
Oh, this is too long for me.
[ Drill Sergeant ]
Eyes front.!
[ Murdoch ]
Carry on, Drill Sergeant.
- What? What?
- You were right. He’s a sharp kid.
His real name is Nathanial Hobbs.
He doctored his driver’s license.
- I hear it’s the smart thing to do in his line of work.
- What? What?
He sold crack, Rago. Apparently he was quite the entrepreneur.
Wayne County Sheriff has a warrant out for his arrest.
Two counts possession.
I guess he thought he could hide out in the army.
Sorry, Bill.
Damn it!
Damn it!
- Life in the streets isn’t easy
- That’s it.
- All I see is pain and misery
- You forgot about these.
I kneel and pray for the victory
Strength and protection to survive
In this society
A wild kid out to get a bid
Did some shit that he never should a did
But he paid the price lived real trite
Ruined his life and lived by the knife
Had to learn the hard way
But someday you gotta pay
Hold it.! Wait.!
Wait! Wait up!
Wait. Look.
I talked to Colonel James.
This is ridiculous.
It’s the army.
- Teach.
- I don’t know what to say.
Let it be.
I’m sorry this happened. I--
Just let it be, Teach.
‘Cause statistics show that kids with no dough
Ain’t got no chance got nowhere to go
- That’s why life on the streets--
-[ Davis ] Good luck, Hobbs.
- It’ll echo in your head
‘til you’re dead
- Bye.
[ M.P.]
Stay up, Hobbs.
- Poor bastard.
- [ Sighs ]
He had the stuff.
He could a made it.
[ Ignition Starts ]
Life in the streets is a mystery
Don’t know my friends from my enemies
Up the ladder could be trouble
But I’ll hold on tight
And I will never never give up the fight
- How ya doin’, Miranda?
- All right.
- [ Montgomery ] You all right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Keep your head up.
- All right. Um--
We just, uh-- we just finished the play within the play.
Um, so let’s discuss what happens.
Come on.
You know what happens.
Wanna know what happens?
I know what happens.
You try to stand up, and they knock you down.
Then you show ‘em that you’re smart... and they get rid of your sorry ass.
- That’s what happens.
- That’s right.
That’s the way it always goes. Hoo-ah?
[ All ]
Hoo-ah.
A couple of days ago... without discussing it with him...
I went to the army to ask them to look into Hobbs’s record.
- You did what, man?
- [ Davis ] Oh, man.!
- [ Davis ] Oh, man.
- [ Montgomery ]
What’s the matter with you?
[ Recruits Chattering ]
I didn’t know anything about his past.
- Neither did any of you.
- Yeah, right.
I believed in his potential.
I wanted to see him succeed.
I am sorry for the result.
You sorry?
All I know is, the choices we make... dictate the life we lead.
To thine own self be true.
- One, two, three--
- [ All ] One!
- One, two, three--
- Two!
- One, two, three--
- Three.!

Hey, excuse me, sir.

[ War Drums Beating ]
[ Drumming Continues, Shouting ]
- It’s the drummer. Hey. Ya hear that?
- [ Man ] Shh.
Turn around. What are you, the noise monitors?
Turn around.
Turn around already. Aah.
Lend thee eye a terrible aspect.
Let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon.
Let the brow overwhelm it as fearfully as doth a galled rock.
Now set the teeth... and stretch the nostril wide.
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height.
On... on you noblest English... whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof.
Fathers that like so many Alexanders have in these parts... from morn ‘til even fought... and sheathed their swords for lack of argument.
Dishonor not your mothers.
Now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war.
And you, good yeomen... whose limbs were made in England... show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Let us swear that you are worth your breeding... which I doubt not.
For there is none of you so mean and base... that hath not noble luster in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips... straining upon the start.
- [ War Drums Beating ]
- The game’s afoot.!
Follow your spirit... and upon this charge cry...
- God for Harry.

- [ Laughing ]
- Mel, you slept through the whole thing, didn’t you?
No, I didn’t sleep at all.
I really enjoyed it, Mr. Bill.
I can’t thank you enough.
The best part was the drummer.
The drummer was the best part of the whole joint.
Listen, I liked the whole thing.
Everything was great.
I just didn’t like them stupid accents they used.
That’s so stupid.
Why can’t they talk like us, right?
- Listen to yourself.
- Listen to you!
- [ Haywood ] Rocky Balboa or somebody.
- [ Laughing ]

- You’re drivin’ me crazy, okay?
- Okay, okay. I said okay.
- Quiet, now.
- One time you gotta tell me. One time.
- Where’d you get that?
- At the theater. Relax, I paid for it.

See, I need some information about a soldier who served in Vietnam.
- His name is Brian Davis, Sr.
- Okay.
No, wait. It would be, actually, Brian Davis.
Grand Forks, North Dakota.
Okay. Are you C.I.D.?
Of course I’m C.I.D.
Why else would I be here, right?
Excuse me one second.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
He needs--
- [ Speaking Low ]
- He does, huh? I’ll handle it, then.
- Hi. No.
- What?
She’s not allowed to access those files... without prior authorization from her supervisor.
I’m her supervisor.
But I just told her
I was C.I.P.
C.I.T.?
C.I.G.?
- D.’’
- D.’’
I’m C.I.D. So, can I get the records?
- No.
- Aw, come on.
Is that all you ever say?
No.
Hmm. A window of opportunity.
[ Softly ]
Huh?
No?
Mr. Bill, why do we need to know... every Tom, Dick, and Orsic in this play anyhow?
Aha.
Melvin, I’m glad you asked.
- Where you goin’?
- No, no, no.
[ Recruits ]
Oh.! Aw.!
In four days, each and every one of you... will be up in front of the class... facin’ the firing squad.
- Who’s doin’ the shootin’?
- Me.
You never said nothin’
‘bout no damn test.
Nobody asked me. I’m the teacher.
- My hands are sweatin’ already.
- I thought you was my boy.
Give us a ride here.
No more rides, Montgomery.
No more free passes.
Look, um, Mr. Rago, we talked about this.
I’m not good at tests.
- [ Recruits Chattering ]
- Look.
You are not dumb.
But I need you to know that. that nobody gave you anything.
I want you to know what it feels like to make the grade... all on your own.
You can do it.
I know it.
Victory starts here.
- [ Man ] Recruits, single file.!
- I need you to fill these in... and return ‘em with your attendance sheets A.S.A.P.
I need ‘em for the boys’ records.
They graduate next week.
- What is this?
- It’s a certificate. It says they’ve completed the course.
Oh. Well, they haven’t. Not yet.
I’ll sign ‘em when they pass the test.
Test? What test?
I’m giving ‘em a test this Friday.
- Oh, no, you’re not.
- Oh, yes, I am.
Look, you don’t kid around with tests in the army.
- Tests are real things here.
- That’s right, including mine.
Look, you’ve done your job.
The Drill Sergeants are happy with your guys.
They’re makin’ it as soldiers.
They don’t need your test.
You’re wrong, Tom. If they pass it, they’ll know they earned something.
And if they flunk it, they’re gone.
This isn’t Princeton.
We don’t have summer school. You got it?
- [ Exhales ]
- Sit down, please, Bill.
Look, I know you mean well... but this time listen to me.
They’re almost there.
Don’t do to them what you did to Hobbs.
This came for you.
[ Hobbs ]
Dear Mr. Rago... thanks for all your letters.
I don’t know what you and
Captain Murdoch wrote to the warden... but it sure worked ‘cause I may be gettin’ outta here soon.
Just wanted you to know
I been reading Othello.
Imagine that::
Mr. Shakespeare writin’ about a black man way back then... and a soldier too.
Prison librarian says I’m the first to check out Shakespeare in 1 6 years.
She asked me if I was interested in signin’ up for some college classes.
I told her if they had a few teachers like you...
I just might.
Well, Mr. Rago, like Hamlet says...
""The rest is silence. ‘"
Sincerely...
Nathanial T. Hobbs.
Hey, Mr. Rago, let’s talk about the fight...
Yo, Billy, my boy, let’s get back to the graveyard...
‘cause them clowns diggin’ up them skulls-- that’s the mad stuff.
- Yo, what’s up with that?
- All right. Okay.
Mr. Rago, does Hamlet have a last name or what?
[ Montgomery ]
I know you know. You the man.
Yup. Yup. We’re gonna go over everything... but, uh... but first
I have to talk to you about something.
Um, according to the army...
[ Exhales ] you’re not required to take a test... to pass this class.
Hallelujah! Hey, yo!
We passed!
I give you an A+, Mel.
Thank you. Well, you get an A+ too.
Now, hold on, Mr. Bill.
What are you sayin’ here... that if we fail, we still pass?
No. If you take a test, and you fail... you’re out.
You’re out of the army. Is that clear?
- What?
- Um, you said if we take the test.
Yeah, Davis. The choice is yours.
Hold on. Hold on, Billy. How ‘bout if we take the test, pass the test?
We get a bonus? We get, like, keys to a car, cash, a prize maybe?
A little somethin’?
Some incentive?
You get a prize.
Yeah.
But you can’t drive it... or spend it... or even see it.
All you can do is feel it.
What the hell kind of prize is that?
I got a family, all right?
I need this job.
Imagine goin’ home, tellin’ your ma you got a Shakespearean discharge.
- Bill.
- Hmm?
If you get any sadder, you’re gonna trip over your lip.
I’m sorry. Uh, I’m just not a fun date tonight.
Aw, just lighten up a little bit.
- People are gonna think I kidnapped you.
- [ Laughs ]
You know, we get to keep these.
- Ah.
- I have a lovely set of 1 6 at home.
I’m not much of a collector, but maybe if I get a bigger footlocker.
Yeah. Heh.
- You have a great sense of humor.
- Well, I’m a staff sergeant.
- Staff Sergeant Marie.
- Staff Sergeant Leighton to you.
- Staff Sergeant anything to me.
- [ Woman ] Sergeant?
- Oh, there you are, Shana. Are you okay?
- Sorry I’m late.
Mm-hmm. Hi.
- Remember me?
- Hi.
I’m Shana. Shana Leroy.
I believe you know my husband.
You’re Leroy’s--
Yeah. So is he.
Ah! I-I didn’t know that--
- Well, how’s the kid?
- Fine.
- Oh. Oh.
- You’re right, you know.
[ Chuckles ]
Little joke.
- Yeah?
- [ Chuckles ]
These are for you.
Mr. Davis’s records.
Mr. Rago, can you put it--
[ Marie ] I would show it to Sergeant Cass first.
Marie.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
And thank you.
- [ Whispering ] Uh, I’m gonna--
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
They’re on bivouac tonight.
- Mmm. Looks like things went well.
- Yeah.
- Nice kiss? Mm-hmm.
- Yes, it was. Thanks.
Oh.
[ Cass ]
Said weapon was found... approximately 50 yards to my left...
- in a large puddle of water.
- [ Haywood ] It’s my rifle,
Drill Sergeant!
Now, men, this is totally unacceptable!
[ Haywood ]

- Fall back in!
- [ Bill ] Lou.!

Lou! Hey, Lou! Come here!
It’s important.!
[ Groans ]
I know he does this on purpose.
[ Grunts ]
[ Cass ] Yes, I love this weather.!
I love the rain.!
- He’s crazy.
- I love it.!
This is where we really start trainin’!
Just because it’s rainin’, the battle doesn’t stop! Remember that!
- [ Cass ] Go.!
- [ Recruits Grunting ]
[ Grunting ]
My old drill sergeant used to say-- go!
[ Shouting, Grunting ]
""If it ain’t rainin’, we ain’t trainin’.!’"
Oh, give me the rain!
Give me the rain!
Yes, indeed.
Go.!
Private Melvin, front and center on the double!
Go.!
[ Recruits Shouting, Grunting ]
Private Melvin, you study Shakespeare.
Yes, sir, Drill Sergeant!
Go! Let me hear it, then.
I study Shakespeare, Drill Sergeant!
No.! No.! I wanna hear some.!
Recite it. Go!
Fall back in. Private Benitez!
Front and center.!
[ Grunts ]
Private Benitez, New York.
- You study Shakespeare?
- Drill Sergeant, yes, Drill Sergeant!
All right.
Let me hear some. Go!
I said I wanna hear some. Let’s go!
[ Shouting Continues ]
He that lives--
Come on, what?
What was that? I can’t hear it!
Come on.! Go.!
[ Grunting, Shouting Continue ]
He that outlives this day... and comes safe home... will stand a-tiptoe when this day is named... and rouse him at the name of Crispian.
I didn’t tell ya to stop.
Keep goin’!
Keep goin’!
Go.!
He that shall live this day and see old age... will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say... tomorrow is Saint Crispian.’’
Then will he strip his sleeves, show his scars... and say, These wounds I had on Saint Crispian’s day.’’
Old men forget, yet all shall be forgot.
But he’ll remember with advantages... what feats he did that day.
Then shall our names... familiar in his mouth as household words...
Harry the King,
Bedford and Exeter...
Warwick and Talbot...
Salisbury and Gloucester... be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
And this story shall the good man teach his son.
And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by... from this day to the ending of the world... but we in it shall be remembered.
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
We few... we happy few... we band of brothers.
For he today that sheds his blood with me... shall be my brother.
And gentlemen in England now abed... shall think themselves accursed they were not here... and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks... who fought with us... upon Saint Crispian’s day.
That enough, Drill Sergeant?
Yes, Benitez. Good.
- That was nice!
- Good job!
Great.
What’s this?
These are Davis’s father’s records.
Do what you think is right.
One, two, three, four

- Double! Rear! Hesitate! March!
Ahh... ahh...

I said freeze!
Squad, assume test positions! Huh!
Sir.! Double-D squad reporting for final exam... sir.
Hoo-ah!
I feel sorry for Ophelia
‘cause she kills herself.
‘Cause first Hamlet dumps her, and then he kills her father.
It was an accident, but he did it. that he really did love her.
Suicide ain’t the way out.
A lot of people are on their own, and they make it.
- The ghost.
- Excellent.
- Benitez.
- Uh, Yorick.
Yorick.
Yeah. Haywood.
Laertes.
Gimme somebody else.
- Laertes, Haywood.
- Laertes is a fool!
He ain’t never stopped to think about what type of person Hamlet was.
All he does is do what the king tells him to do.
When he fights Hamlet, all they do is end up killin’ each other.
That’s his problem. He don’t stop and think before he acts.
I want somebody else, Bill.
[ Bill ]
Queen Gertrude. Fortinbras.
What did we learn from the graveyard scene?
- Leroy.
- Well, maybe it means something, maybe it don’t, but, um--
Well, I can see why the gravedigger say he went to work the very day Hamlet was born.
I mean-- Well, it’s kinda funny when you think about it.
The day you’re born, you start to die.
You see, when Hamlet see that skull in the graveyard, he see the light.
Skull ain’t got no tongue, you see?
That’s why later, when Hamlet’s lyin’ there, dyin’... he won’t let his man Horatio kill himself.
Say, Nah, man. I’m already gone.
Don’t fall on your sword for me.
""You gotta go on and be my tongue... tell my story, so I can live on.’’
You dig what I’m sayin’?
It’s deep, ya know?
- Yeah, it’s way deep. Two times.
- Yeah. All right.
Two times, baby.
Three times.
So what do we get out of this play?
Melvin.
Ya know... all the people in the play-- the kings and the queens and the princes-- they all die.
And in the end, all that’s left is the two guys...
Fortinbras and Horatio.
A soldier and a student.
Ain’t that somethin’?
That is something, Melvin.
Some eight or nine weeks ago, a young man or woman... apprehensively boarded a train, plane, or got into a car... and began a journey to become a part of something... they only knew vaguely as the army.
That’s Marie over there.
- [ Colonel James ] They did not go away to do something.
- [ Bill ] See?
This is Emily.
My daughter.
[ Emily ]
Hi.
I met her here.
Well, you could tell.
- She’s cute.
- Thank you. Well, she’s very nice.
Today, we see them on this graduation field.
They are somehow stronger, prouder... more mature, changed.
Today, you fine young men and women... assume your positions as guardians of America’s future... and that future looks bright indeed... for both you and your country.
But we must never forget our debt of gratitude to the past... and those who have served the army so bravely... and so well.
That is why I am especially proud... to dedicate this ceremony... to a fallen, but not forgotten,
American hero.
A young radio operator serving in Vietnam... whose platoon came under mortar attack near the outpost at Soc Trang.
This soldier held his post under fire... to relay coordinates... which facilitated an artillery response.
This soldier gave his own life... in order to prevent the loss... of so many others.
I want to thank a civilian instructor... for pointing out this oversight...
Mr. William Rago... for his efforts in seeing that the family of this fallen soldier... receives the honor he so richly deserves.
Company, attention!
Son, it’s an honor to present to you... your father’s silver star.
About face.!

And our love won’t be divided
Maybe one day we’ll be united
United
And our love won’t be divided
We've smelted our steel... and reached our production target.
We're off to report the good news.
Everyone's earned merit.
Fugui, Jiazhen, you've made a real contribution.
There'll be dumplings at the canteen tonight... with a whole pig stuffed in each one!
Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.
Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.
We've made enough steel for three cannon balls.
They'll all go to Taiwan!
One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed... another on his dinner table... and the last in the toilet!
He won't be able to sleep or eat or ever take a dump... and we'll liberate Taiwan!
Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.
Let them sleep. They'll eat later.
Xu Youqing!
What's up?
The teacher wants us at school smelting steel.
The District Head's making an inspection.
All right. You go on ahead.
Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.
He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.
Leave him alone.
- The District Chief is coming.
- So?
A kid still has to sleep.
Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.
Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.
Youqing has to go.
Wake up.
You have to go smelt steel.
Come on, get up.
Your classmates are already on their way.
Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.
Are 15 dumplings enough?
Have 20. You should eat more.
Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.
When you get there... put your dumplings in hot water.
Make sure you make them hot enough.
Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.
- Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.
- Do you like meat?
- Yes.
That's good.
If Youqing does as daddy says... our lives will get better and better.
Our family... is like a little chicken.
When it grows up, it becomes a goose.
And that'll turn into a sheep.
The sheep will turn into an ox.
And after the ox?
After the ox is Communism.
And there'll be dumplings and meat every day.
It's Fugui's son?
District Chief arrived after dark.
He backed up, and his jeep knocked the wall down.
Youqing was sleeping on the other side.
When the wall collapsed... he didn't have a chance.
The District Chief was hurt, too.
He hadn't slept for three days.
Fugui, listen to me.
We have to try and bear it, even in the worst of times.
What's happened?
Answer me!
Daddy's here! Say something!
Take the body away!
We mustn't let his mother see.
Mommy's here! Youqing!
Youqing! What's going on?
Let me see him!
You never had the chance to eat the dumplings I packed for you.
Mommy's made you more... twenty this time.
That should be enough.
Once you've eaten... you can sleep... a nice, deep sleep.
In life, you never had a good night's sleep.
So sleep well now.
Mommy will come see you every day.
Youqing, can you ever forgive me?
I shouldn't have let you go to school.
I should've kept your dad... from making you go.
It's all my fault.
If only I'd stopped him.
I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!
Oh, my poor darling.
The District Chief has come.
The one who ran over my son?
What's he doing here?
Tell him to leave. He killed my son.
- He's already here.
- Tell him to go.
It's me, Chunsheng.
I meant to call... after I settled in.
Fugui... how could it be your son?
You're the District Chief?
It was you who killed my son?
I had only one son, Chunsheng!
I had only one son!
And you killed him!
You, behind the goddamn wheel!
Don't be like that.
The District Chief is upset, too.
How can I ever make it up?
Take this for now.
It's money.
Tell me what else I can do.
No one wants your money.
I want my son. Give me back my son.
You killed him! Give him back to me!
Go away!
Remember, you owe us a life.
You killed him. Remember that.
You killed him.
Go away! Now!
District Chief, let's go.
I think you should go, Chief.
Go away!
All right.
I'm going.
I owe you a life.
I will remember.
What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!
What are you doing?
How dare you!
What's going on?
She smashed the windows of the jeep.
Who the heck is she?
Let her go!
Are you mad?
Do you want your jeep?
No!
The 1960s
June 1966: Start of the
"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution".
It lasted 10 years... and left no family unaffected.
- You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.
- Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.
Sit here.
You have to get rid of those puppets.
Everyone knows about them.
I was telling Jiazhen... that we could... do propaganda shows.
Put these old things to new use.
Don't you see what they are?
Emperors, scholars and beauties.
Classic feudal types.
Latest editorial:
"The older, the more reactionary".
Do as Chairman Mao says.
They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.
Let's not bring up the past.
Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.
Fetch a brazier.
You can't keep them. Burn them!
Fugui... 
Chunsheng has asked me many times... to get you a better job. What do you think?
Delivering water is fine.
Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.
We'll discuss it later.
I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.
I'll tell you about him.
Let's not let her in on it for now.
I've found just the man for her.
His name is Wan Erxi.
He works in a factory in the county seat.
He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.
He'd like to meet her.
Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?
He's also got a handicap... a lame leg.
How lame? Can he walk?
Yes, and run if he has to.
He can run?
Was he born a cripple?
No, it was an accident at work.
He gets compensation.
Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.
Does she mind us playing matchmaker?
She's not opposed, she does fret about leaving us.
Comrade Wan Erxi's here.
Comrade Wan Erxi.
Fengxia's mom and dad.
Come inside.
Have something to drink.
Quotations from Chairman Mao
Comrade Wan works at the East Wind Factory.
His father and grandfather were workers, too.
Solid working class stock.
Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.
A good family.
The Liberation Army gave me that certificate.
Good.
Where's Fengxia?
Comrade Wan Erxi.
Comrade Fengxia.
I'll be going.
Have something to eat first.
Lunch is ready.
No, thanks.
You won't stay?
Have some lunch first.
No, really.
Let's go.
What do you think?
His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.
I approve.
Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?
He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.
If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.
Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.
I think she likes him.
It's different from before. Look.
Go ask Mr. Niu... what the boy thinks.
How's this for Fengxia?
Comrade, could I look at that one?
There's trouble at your home.
Red Guards are swarming over the place.
I just caught them on a ladder, pulling off roof tiles.
From where?
No idea! The leader is a cripple.
You'd better hurry back.
A cripple?
Must be Wan Erxi!
He doesn't like Fengxia, so he tears the place down.
Anything is possible.
Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.
We'd better hurry.
Don't forget your package!
Aren't you busy!
I brought some colleagues.
We're fixing the place up.
We replaced the roof tiles... so it wouldn't leak anymore.
And we've painted Chairman Mao's portrait.
Fengxia helped us.
You're just in time. We've just finished.
- Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.
We must be going.
Do stay! Come on inside.
Erxi painted this.
"The working class leads us all".
Erxi is good with his hands.
He painted all the Chairman Maos in our factory!
I'll get some water so you can wash up.
Thanks, we'll go to the factory bathhouse.
You've gone to so much trouble.
Please come again.
What do you think about Fengxia and me?
We're happy if you are.
We approve.
Shall we set a date?
Anytime. You decide.
Fengxia's had a hard life.
If you don't mind... let's make the wedding a real occasion.
To make her happy.
Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia... begin their wedded life.
In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.
Let's sing a song!
Nothing compares to the Party's benevolence
Chairman Mao is dearer than father and mother
There's nothing as good as socialism
No ocean as deep as class feeling
Maoist Thought is revolution's treasure trove
Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy
Come on, you can't cry today.
They're all singing for Fengxia... and she can't even join in!
At least it's loud enough for her to hear.
Time for a photo!
Move aside! Stand still!
Hold your little Red Books.
Clear a path! Ship sailing through!
Let's get the whole family.
The ship of revolution! Advance through the storm with Chairman Mao!
Time to wrap up.
First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.
Chairman Mao... 
Comrade Fengxia's mine now.
Come over here.
Now, bow!
Dad, Mom... 
I'm taking Fengxia.
I'll look after her.
Go on, don't be sad.
You'll be back!
Chunsheng.
Congratulations on Fengxia's wedding.
- When did you get here?
- A while ago.
But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.
Come on inside.
Jiazhen, make some tea.
Isn't the tea ready yet?
Chunsheng's been here for ages.
Water's not boiled.
Sit with us for a bit.
Don't be like that.
Come as soon as the water's ready.
But here's boiled water.
Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.
You can't go on avoiding him.
Can't we put this behind us?
If only Youqing had been here today.
I'll be going.
Don't go. The tea's ready.
Never mind.
Jiazhen, I know you don't want to see me.
I'll leave my gift here and be gone.
Give it back to him.
I don't want his gifts.
But it's Chairman Mao.
Dad! Mom!
Come on in!
Fengxia, you're back!
You cold?
I'm fine, really.
How are you feeling, Mom?
On the mend.
Better when you come over.
Have you eaten?
I'll make something.
Lunch is all taken care of.
Help me with the table.
You brought a bottle.
Dad, Mom, we're having a baby.
No wonder there's a bottle!
Really?
I just came from the hospital.
The doctor says it's due in autumn.
Fengxia's going to be a mother.
Fengxia, you're going to be a mother.
Cheers!
Erxi, when you went to the hospital today... what did they say about Fengxia's health?
That she's in terrific shape.
Still, you can't be too careful.
Your folks aren't around.
After the birth, you'll stay with us for a while.
Spend as much time as you can with her.
When I was pregnant with Fengxia... her dad was never around.
He was very busy?
Very!
Don't bring up the past.
I was a real no-hoper.
But things are better now.
And will be better for your child.
Erxi, drink up.
Help yourself.
I had the photo framed.
We haven't taken a photo in years.
This is great.
After the child is born... have a photo taken every year.
We've no photos of Fengxia as a child.
Okay.
Fengxia, after the child is born... have a photo taken every year.
Dad, I saw Chunsheng yesterday.
He's been arrested as a capitalist.
They held a public trial against him.
We have to draw a line between us and him.
Of course.
There's always been a line.
Haven't had much to do with him for years.
Fugui!
Who's there?
Chunsheng.
Who?
Chunsheng.
What do you want?
Come out for a second.
Just say what you want.
It'll just take a minute.
Well?
Fugui... 
I've always felt terrible about Youqing.
I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.
It's all in this account. Take it.
You came for this?
Take this... and my heart will be at ease.
All my debts will have been paid.
What do you mean?
Yesterday, my wife killed herself.
Killed herself?
Why?
I don't know.
Have you seen her body?
No.
I just got an official notice.
You mustn't lose hope.
Don't go getting any stupid ideas.
You must bear it, no matter what!
You can't take that road yourself.
I don't want to live anymore!
You just have to!
We've been through the valley of death.
Coming out alive wasn't easy.
Can't you see?
Let's say we accept this money.
Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.
I know how difficult it must be... but you've got to pull through... you've got to bear it!
I don't think I can.
Chunsheng, it's cold.
Come inside.
Yes, come in.
No, thank you, I've got to go.
I snuck out just now... and better get back.
Chunsheng, remember... you still owe us a life!
You've got to value yours!
Mr. Niu, is your wife at home?
Yes.
What are these eggs for?
Fengxia's about to have a baby.
It's to thank the matchmaker!
Fengxia's about to give birth?
Time does fly!
Erxi sent word from the hospital.
She's in labor. We're on our way there.
Another working class member on the way!
So we've got to get going.
We'll bring the baby to see you.
- But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.
Never mind. Let's go. Don't worry.
Why's she crying?
What's happened?
I'm no longer head of the township.
They say I'm a capitalist.
I have to confess my crimes.
You! Crimes?
You, a capitalist?
Everyone knows you.
I have faith in the Party.
I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.
When will they let you return?
Let's not talk about it.
You go to Fengxia.
Go now, I'll be okay.
Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!
We'll visit you after she's out of the hospital.
Send her my very best. She's producing a little revolutionary successor.
Everything's fine and normal.
They say she's great. No problems.
When is it due?
From the contractions, not right now.
Fengxia, don't be nervous.
Won't hurt a bit.
Remember to breathe and push.
When you're pushing, bite on a towel.
Where's the towel?
Here, bite on this. It'll save your teeth.
Do whatever the doctor tells you.
It'll be quick if you push.
Do as Mommy says and push.
Everything will be fine.
What's this about pushing?
Too early for pushing!
And what's this shouting? Out!
Go wait in the corridor.
Okay, we're going.
- Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.
Sit down.
They're all so young.
Are they nurses?
Who examined Fengxia?
They did.
You haven't seen any doctors?
No.
Go ask where the doctors are.
We must find a good doctor.
They've been locked away.
The Red Guards are in control!
No doctors?
Comrade, are there any doctors?
Yes, us!
I mean, older ones.
They're all reactionaries.
We've overthrown them.
Relax. Your wife's fine.
We can handle this.
Erxi, I'm worried.
Fengxia's a mute.
Can these young people cope?
We need an experienced doctor.
Even if he only stands by, we would relax.
Have to get one out.
Let me think.
What is he doing here?
No reactionaries allowed!
Wang Bin! Stand up!
This is the same Wang Bin who once insulted... me and my wife, saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.
How vile can you get?
We dragged him here today... to educate him, to criticize him... and to let him witness her giving birth.
To show him the heirs of this new, Red world.
The working class is really something!
Wang Bin, don't make any trouble.
Don't move.
I wouldn't dare.
That's professor Wang... head of obstetrics.
Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.
I was putting on a show.
We're not accusing you.
My wife's having a baby.
I wanted you here for her sake.
No, it's better if I wear it.
Let me wear it!
Go ask.
I'm just going to see him.
He's all right.
Just hungry.
Hasn't been fed for three days!
I'll go buy some buns.
Where's Erxi?
They've gone to eat.
How's Fengxia?
They say she's fine.
Want one?
Give them to Dr. Wang.
Dr. Wang, have some buns.
Take your time. There's plenty.
Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?
Of course not. She wasn't born that way.
Will the baby be crippled?
Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.
Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.
Why not use this time... to think of a name for the kid?
What name do you like?
"Don't Gamble".
- Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.
What name do you like?
"Little Bun".
You just say anything!
That's not a name!
But it's a tradition.
Cat, Dog or Little Bun... are not recorded in the Register of Names.
He'd know for sure.
He doesn't know those kids exist... so they don't die.
That's what the old folks say.
Okay, then Little Bun it is.
For now, anyway.
Later, his dad can give him a proper name.
Where's the family of Xu Fengxia?
It's a boy, 7.9 pounds.
- Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.
We said it would be fine!
Comrade, how's my daughter?
Fine. Mother and son are fine.
Is he normal?
Absolutely.
Can we see them?
No, there's danger of infection.
Let us have a quick peek, please?
Please, comrade, just one peek?
Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?
It's a boy.
They are fine. He's 7.9 pounds.
Do you hear him?
Are they in there?
- Have a look.
- Not yet!
Please, I'm the father!
It doesn't matter. We're not done yet.
Wait outside. When we're finished, you can see her as much as you want.
We'll see them soon.
Is it a boy?
Yes, 7.9 pounds!
- How is he?
- They're both fine!
Erxi, you're a lucky man!
My son was only 5.5 pounds.
7.9 pounds is excellent.
If you get a car from the factory... we can drive Fengxia home.
Good idea.
Erxi, seeing as they are both fine... why don't you see Dr. Wang back.
What's with him?
He ate too quickly.
Did he eat all seven buns?
Yes, just gobbled them up.
Quick, get some water.
You two get the car, we'll be fine.
Have some water.
Careful, it's hot.
Some water should help.
Why'd he do that?
He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.
Drink it slowly.
Help us!
She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.
Quick!
Don't panic. Think of something.
We're just students.
We don't know what to do.
Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?
Yes, he's a professor.
He'd know for sure.
He'll know.
Get Dr. Wang over here.
What's wrong with him? What happened?
He's eaten too much.
What do you mean?
He gobbled up seven buns.
He was starving.
But he was okay after the water.
It was the water that did it.
Never mind. Drag him over!
She's bleeding! Quick!
Please, Doctor, please!
You'll pull through!
It's all right.
Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.
Dr. Wang!
- Feeling better?
- Not at all.
Oxygen.
Fengxia! You'll pull through.
Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.
Please, Doctor, she's my only daughter.
The only child I have left.
Fengxia! Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.
Some years later... 
Grandpa! It's crooked again.
Is it?
I'll fix it.
Take the medicine to Granny.
Granny, your medicine.
Back already?
Has Little Bun been a good boy?
I delivered 10 thermoses of water.
Such a good little boy.
Ten whole thermoses.
Have you had your medicine?
I'll make lunch.
Little Bun... give me a hand.
I light the fire?
Yes, and I'll make some noodles.
I want to visit Fengxia's grave again... and take Little Bun's photos... to show her.
He's another year older.
Fine, I'll let Erxi know.
Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.
We should've bought them on the way home.
Now we've got to carry them!
Careful! Don't drop them!
Are you happy?
Grandpa, where will the chicks live?
Where will they live?
I'll find a home for them when we get back.
Youqing eats dumplings.
Fengxia looks at photos.
Little Bun, do you know who Youqing is?
Uncle.
- And Fengxia?
- Mommy.
What a clever boy!
Granny, why all the photos for Fengxia?
Before you were born... 
Granny said to mommy that... she should take a photo every year.
If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns... everything would've been fine.
He could have saved our Fengxia.
He's a professor, after all.
He always carries on like this.
It's okay.
We shouldn't have given him water.
People say, once you drink water... one bun in the stomach turns to seven.
Dr. Wang ate seven buns.
Seven times seven is 49.
It's much too much.
Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang... won't eat buns, only rice now?
Not just buns... anything made from wheat.
Rice costs more than wheat.
What a food bill he must have.
- I'll make dinner.
- I'll help.
No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.
Little Bun, behave yourself.
Grandpa, where'll we put the chicks?
Let's see.
How about in here?
This box is bigger, isn't it?
They'll have more room to run around.
Then they'll eat more.
And soon they'll grow up.
When will they grow up?
Very soon.
And then?
And then... the chickens will turn into geese... and the geese will turn into sheep... and the sheep will turn into oxen.
And after the oxen?
After oxen... 
After oxen, Little Bun will grow up.
I want to ride on an ox's back!
You will ride on an ox's back.
Little Bun won't ride on an ox... he'll ride trains and planes... and life will get better and better.
AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER
Mount Fuji.
That's what Mother called the hill opposite our home.
Mother embellished everything.
She had a Mozartian nature.
Gee up!
Gee up!
Come on!
See? I caught the ferry.
I told you I'd make it!
Will you take me to the ball?
Why won't you answer me, Spayu?
Listen, old man, if you don't introduce me,
I'll shoot myself.
I'm sick of these Bulgarian yokels, these peasants and smugglers.
What I need is plenty of civilisation.
- What'll you give me?
- Champagne.
Alright then, as long as it's Lili's.
- I'll have to pay!
That's the one I like.
Gentlemen, you were told it was closed.
- Were you not?
- We stay put!
This is our place of work.
Not happy?
Go fuck yourself!
Go fuck yourself, you fool!
Shut it, or Bela Kun will put flowers on your grave.
I'll wait downstairs.
This place is closed.
Doctor!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Here's your licence.
You can open in 2 days.
Tomorrow is Sunday!
I'll miss the fair days.
Orders are orders, madam.
You'll spend 2 days at the fishery.
The workers will pounce on us.
And it's full of mosquitoes.
That's for sure.
I'm not such a bad sort.
I'll return your key. Here.
Lock them in their rooms.
Two days!
Don't let them out.
They can pee in a pot.
They must not be seen, or there'll be hell to pay. Clear?
We're closing the establishment.
For God's sake!
Please leave now or I'll fetch the General.
That's enough!
The fun is over.
The girls must not stand by the windows.
Watch that Hergie.
She's barmy.
Barmy, me?
I'm not the barmy one around here.
Fuck your mother!
Go fuck yourself, bastard.
Your mother's crazy, son of a bitch!
Tanza. Come see, Tanza.
- The General is so handsome!
- Isn't he?
He wanted to pay me by the hour!
Natsuku, Manelu,
Michu, my dear Miki.
- No. It isn't Miki!
- What?
It is! It's Miki.
- Dismarescu the prosecutor.
- Prosecutor my arse!
He only gets an erection with the gramophone.
There's the prince. Hergie!
Come and see your prince.
Wait a minute!
Damn this skirt.
- Come on, Hergie! Come on!
- Hurry!
Hergie, get a move on!
- Hurry up!
- I'm going to give him an eyeful.
That's Hergie's bottom.
Get rid of that.
Sort the matter out at once.
Boyars to the gallows!
I'm going to cut their balls.
Long live the revolution!
Hurrah for Bela Kun!
We're here and we're staying!
We're here and we're staying!
Bella Boquet. Why...
Why did you...
Having a beautiful bottom does not mean you can mock the Rumanian army.
We didn't make Rumania great for you to make fun of it.
My God, what a woman!
Don't you agree?
I want a girl like her.
Too good for you.
Telescope is wooing her, but her husband, Petrica, is so jealous.
He would challenge the General to a duel.
Have you seen their horses?
I want some.
- You want so many things.
- Look.
She scratched my hand.
It's swollen.
Bloody whore!
What a crowd!
Enough to drive one mad, my dear Helena.
This dump is enough to depress one.
I find Paris as boring, Serban.
We're late, Aunt Hélène.
We were waiting for you.
The dancing has already begun.
Is that so?
You see no difference with Paris?
No. I see no difference.
No real difference.
No difference at all.
What a wonderful soirée!
Thank you so much.
- I'm delighted.
- I'd do anything for you, my dear.
Tili thinks I'm throwing the ball for him, but it's for you.
In your honour.
So you can meet whomsoever you like.
The little peacock!
He has gone to fan his tail.
Who is that charming creature?
You don't know?
She's your niece, my dear.
The daughter of our dear sister Sophie, from her first marriage.
You don't say!
Maria-Theresa von Debretsy.
Hasn't it a charming ring?
She doesn't look like us.
She has her mother's eyes.
The rest is her father.
Carol von Debretsy, the Empire's military attaché in London.
That is where his daughter was born.
Broke and arrogant.
He shared his property with the peasants, but that did not stop him being killed in Budapest during the communist plague.
She was luckier, though.
She was rescued just before being raped by our Ustase liberators, by an archangel.
And who is this archangel?
Captain Dumitriu.
- That small man?
- What a good guess!
The scrawny man standing next to her.
Naturally, she became Mrs Dumitriu.
He gave her 3 brats.
She learnt Rumanian, which she speaks perfectly, albeit with a hint of an Oxbridge accent.
She has never mentioned the fact we are related.
As arrogant as her father!
Dear Helena, your ball is unforgettable, a genuine success.
Allow me to offer you this flower.
You will not get off so lightly.
The soirée is to make your stay less tiresome.
But I also have a favour to ask of you.
- You had better not refuse.
- You offend me.
On one condition.
Tell me quickly, I'm dying of thirst.
I could murder a glass of wine.
Right. César, my nephew, the son of my brother Serban, is in the 16th cavalry regiment.
Discharge him!
To hell with your military service!
It's a trifle. You bring out the artillery to kill a fly.
Hey, Prince, come here!
Come over here!
Prince, come here!
Excuse me.
You will have to excuse him for a while.
Discharge Private Laskari from the 16th cavalry.
Discharged!
He may return to his dear parents, the poor yokels.
Listen up, dear man.
If you put a monocle in your rear, you'd be a marvellous telescope.
And if you looked in my arsehole, you would see
I always face the enemy.
Oh, how I like that fool!
- Forgive me. Is he a cousin?
- No.
You aristocrats are all related.
Not to him.
I like him even if he is a fool.
I didn't expect to find someone like you in this godforsaken place.
Do you remember when I first saw you?
- Sir!
- Yes.
I was out riding by the Danube.
You were with the children, in their pram.
- There was another woman.
- The nanny.
I said to myself,
"I don't know who the father is,
"but the mother is remarkable."
Then I saw you riding with Petrica.
I understand.
I've rarely seen a woman ride like you, I swear.
I used to work in a circus.
In Budapest.
That's where Petrica bought me.
I believe you're making fun of me.
No. I used to jump through hoops of fire.
You're related to the Laskaris, aren't you?
A great lady.
400. And you?
I would like to see you again.
There will be other parties at Mrs Vovediane's.
But I would like to see you soon.
I'm awfully busy.
The house, the children.
Wait till they're older.
I shall go out more.
I'll be delighted to see you.
When?
When the children have grown.
But that won't be soon.
In 5 or 10 years.
Did you win or lose?
I lost.
My stole!
Turn around, Wassily.
No, leave it.
A poor person will find it.
I shan't be able to buy you another soon.
Carry on, Wassily.
I intend to request a transfer to another garrison or corps.
Why?
You are happy here and highly regarded.
Your superiors appreciate you.
I shall request a transfer to another garrison.
Do you have any objections?
No, darling.
Actually, maybe it is better.
We're so happy together.
Yes.
Oh, the sweethearts!
Next time,
I shall cut off his ear in a duel.
On what will he hang his monocle?
I will send his wig flying with my sword.
- He wears a wig?
- As if you cannot tell.
He's so tight-arsed.
Tight-arsed!
My mind is made up.
Please request my transfer to another garrison or corps.
- My decision...
- Very well, I shall.
Border control?
Put on Colonel Gutsa.
Not Lutsa or Putsa, you fool. Gutsa!
Hello, Colonel Gutsa?
Listen, Colonel, we haven't replaced the officer...
What was his name?
The officer killed by smugglers.
That's it, him.
The man whose lips were slit with a bayonet.
I'm sending Captain Dumitriu from division HQ.
Yes.
He's to man the border post.
Yes, that's right.
Intensive programme.
Come on, hurry up!
Be careful with the trunk.
Eros, Eros, come here!
Get a move on!
Come on.
Follow me with the trunk.
Carefully!
Sorry you married me?
We won't be here forever.
I like it here.
Eva.
What are you doing?
Wake up!
Unload! Hurry up!
Eros, why's he allowed?
Eros is a dog.
You are not a dog.
When I'm big, I'll be a dog.
Mummy, stop!
Stop, darling, you'll give her bad habits.
What do you expect, Petrica?
He's my lover!
The orderlies are watching us.
So?
Come, I have chocolate.
Chocolate, chocolate!
Hey, gently!
You clumsy oafs, mind the trunk!
Gently!
The other way up!
Be a darling and help.
I can't manage on my own.
See, you and I have the same blue eyes.
- Mine are hazel not blue.
- You have blue eyes.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Mirrors don't lie.
It's a lying mirror!
A Venetian mirror.
We both have blue eyes.
I'll smash it!
Let's say I have blue eyes.
- The children are next door.
- So?
Come on, Petrica, behave!
One, two, three!
Mummy, Mummy!
You're mine!
All mine!
Mummy, play for us.
Come on, Mummy.
Play something for us.
Blasted Magyars!
Don't fret about it.
We don't care.
A child must've thrown a stone.
You give them chocolate and they throw stones.
Stop it, you grump, you're always grumbling.
Have you forgotten?
It was a mirror that lied.
I told you I wanted to smash it.
My respects, madam.
Welcome, Captain.
Glad to have you.
Attention!
About turn, left!
Who ordered the attack?
Which idiot fired?
Stupid cretin!
You wanted to warn them?
You should be court-martialled!
Lieutenant Torturianu!
Lieutenant Torturianu!
Sir!
Evacuate the wounded to Calarasi.
Allow me, Captain.
Did you know Commander Issaya, your predecessor?
He had an 11-year-old girl too.
Here's how they cut his lips with a bayonet.
They cut your lips and throw them to the pigs.
So the pigs can eat them!
My respects, madam.
Stop. Fall out!
Come here.
- Admiring the landscape?
- I like it.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Mount Fuji.
Yes. It's very beautiful.
Come and have a shower, sir.
And what have you been playing, eh?
You've stopped crying, eh?
I made a lovely castle, but he ruined it.
She ruined it too!
My respects, madam.
Blasted Magyar!
My back too, you fool.
These tomatoes are tasteless.
The water isn't fresh.
Don't sulk!
Don't regret you married me.
We shan't stay long.
I like it here.
I'm happy to be here.
The land here is real, as are the men.
Like in Tolstoy's tales about the Caucasus.
So why leave?
Everything will be fine.
We're together.
Hang the rest!
Let's drop it.
Finished.
Finished.
Finished!
These tomatoes are inedible.
What's wrong with them?
Why is that?
They need more water.
The drought.
I'll send the soldiers to water the tomatoes.
That'll be one improvement in this dump!
Finished!
What's he saying?
What did he say?
Mummy!
Come on, Mummy, smile.
Smile, Mummy.
Come and show me your Mount Fuji.
Who goes there? Come here!
Come here!
What the hell are you doing, eh?
No, no, Lieutenant.
Don't hit me, sir!
Attention!
What's he doing?
Fucking stand to attention!
Obey my order, soldier.
Stand to attention!
Did you hear me?
- You stupid bloody shit!
- Don't hit me!
Stand to attention!
- Lieutenant!
- Yes, sir!
Lieutenant Torturianu!
Yes, sir!
Report to my office.
Yes, sir.
Calm down.
Sit down!
Mr Torturianu,
I forbid you to hit the soldiers.
I shall not tell you again!
I intend to take action.
Sir, I hit that soldier for pissing on the wall instead of using the WC.
That's no reason to hit him!
He wasn't to know.
You have been drinking.
You're a disgrace.
I'm confining you for a week.
Drink on leave as much as you like.
In every unit I've served in, the men were beaten.
Not in the unit I'm in charge of!
Goodnight. Fall out.
Yes, sir.
Go to hell!
You won't be in charge soon.
Damn bloody Hun!
Obey!
Take him on patrol.
He can piss in the Danube as much as he likes.
Come on, move it.
Hurry up!
Hey, get your kit, you!
Move it, move it, move it!
The man's a brute.
Just forget about it.
What can you expect?
When you marry a soldier...
Did you need to marry a soldier?
You can be so stupid,
Captain Dumitriu.
Don't smoke so much, it's bad for you.
- Hey, Jean, he'll screw you!
- He'll screw you.
He'll fuck his mother!
I've only two months to go.
Then I'll be free!
Oh, Jean!
Hey, Captain!
The alarm's been raised.
- Petrica! You're wanted.
- What is it?
- You're wanted.
- What?
What's got into you?
Stop bugling!
What is it? Is there a fire?
- Torturianu!
- Sir!
Fetch the machine gun, the horses and the cart.
Fall in! And be quick about it.
Fall in!
Attention!
Look at your uniform!
Get your gear.
Get a move on!
The horses, you clots!
Line up. Now!
Come on, move it!
Your trousers!
Attention!
Forward, march!
And the rifles!
Where are the rifles?
- Eva! Are the children awake?
- No, they're asleep.
What happened?
Some smugglers were spotted.
And the Captain...
Is that where he went?
Yes. To the border.
He won't find them.
They strike and vanish.
It's impossible to catch them.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, have pity on us.
He got scared and fired!
- Which imbecile fired?
- Mr Torturianu!
Go to the stables.
Get out the other cart!
Go fetch some blankets from the shed.
Come and give us a hand.
Give me that blanket.
Get the cart out of the stables.
We'll put them in. Come on!
What are you looking at?
There's nothing to see!
Get lost!
You too, do you hear? Go.
Go away!
Move along! Did you hear me?
Don't stay here, madam.
Like this, to the left.
Come on! More to the left.
There!
That'll teach you a lesson, you rookies!
Do you think they'll feed us?
The dead men's meal!
It's better to see God with a full belly.
Think they'll shoot us?
Shoot us, shoot us...
Fucking shut up!
Children, there you are!
Hello!
You're pretty, you are.
How old are you?
Ah, sonny, no!
How old are you?
You're a pretty girl too.
Come on, give it back.
I'm going to tickle you!
What's your name, then?
And you, sonny?
Don't you worry.
We won't hurt them.
What are those peasants doing in the garden?
Watering it.
It's to keep them busy.
- Why are they here?
- We arrested them.
They're not involved with the smugglers.
They cross the border at night and come right back.
The local police force are very self-important.
They find scapegoats and send them to me.
I have to question them and open cases.
- What happened?
- What do you think?
They attacked the outpost and killed the soldiers.
How many?
Eight.
What is it to you?
You have the children, books, your harpsichord, which we lugged here.
Last night,
I heard the soldiers talking.
What about?
About what they saw.
They mutilate the dead and the living.
You saw that?
You shouldn't have.
Because Sofia wants Dobruja.
Our government, which took the south from Bulgaria, refuses to give it back!
They're all the same, darling.
Ten years ago, fresh out of the military academy,
I fought in this very spot.
We took them by surprise while the Bulgarians surprised the Greek army with which they had surprised the Turkish army, and the Turks etc., etc., etc.
Did you ask the peasants to work for us for free?
I'll pay them.
I have to go.
The police are waiting.
They haven't eaten since yesterday.
Hello, my friends!
Were you given any lunch?
No, madam, nothing at all.
- Why is she asking us?
- It must be the dead men's meal.
So we see God with fully bellies.
Help yourselves.
Please help yourselves.
Come along, please help yourselves.
Thank you, but you needn't have.
We'll be off home soon.
Help yourselves anyway.
Better to travel on a full belly.
Help yourselves.
- God bless you.
- Come on, my friends.
- God bless you.
- Thank you, madam.
- Help yourselves.
- God bless you.
Thank you, madam.
God bless you.
And I want you to know my husband will pay you.
Why pay us?
We're already paid!
Madam, it isn't necessary.
Yes, Dimitar, it is.
This is something else entirely.
When I come to visit you, you'll give me cheese, bread and red wine.
It will be waiting for you.
I insist on paying for your labour.
And there are no buts.
Cheers!
To your health!
Since we're here why not work?
We'll do a good job, like for ourselves.
Hey, you Bulgarians, look over here.
Do as the soldier says.
Go on.
You lot, come closer.
You'll catch a cold in the shade.
Mind the lettuces.
Get a move on. Hurry up.
Come on, over here!
There. Sit down.
Closer together, closer together!
They're not very bright, these Bulgarians.
Look at me.
No, don't hit me, sir!
They're disciplining him.
- What's that?
- I asked if they beat him.
- And did they?
- Same as everyone.
But he scares easily.
Here, Petco.
Why do they beat us, madam?
We're simply obeying.
Under the Bulgarians, it was taxes and army.
And now we're Rumanian, it's the same story.
Why are you lying? Why?
As a young boy,
I sang to the Bulgarian tsar.
The Rumanians were bad.
And now my children sing to the Rumanian king.
The Bulgarians are bad.
What do they want from us?
Tsar Ferdinand, King Ferdinand, it's all the same to us.
The smugglers are Macedonians.
But they speak Rumanian.
That man being thrashed only speaks Turkish.
He's Turkish!
- Well, goodnight, my friends.
- Goodnight, madam.
Go on, Christo.
Tell me about it after.
You two, come over.
Guard the other end of the yard.
If anyone approaches, shoot without hesitation.
Mr Torturianu, eat then report back.
Yes, sir!
You're still up?
Aren't you eating tonight?
No, not hungry.
I'll have a bit of salad.
Don't you like the lettuce?
I do like it, I do indeed.
Go to bed.
I still have things to do.
Why did you beat them?
Damn it!
The orders are to shoot them.
What do you mean?
To have them shot!
I send them into the woods and have them shot.
In retaliation.
To teach the smugglers to behave themselves.
I know very well it's no!
But I'm an officer.
An officer obeys his superiors' orders.
Petrica...
Leave me be. I know all that.
I need to think.
Yes!
Captain, telephone!
The regiment is asking for you.
Get lost!
Go on, get out of here.
Get out of here, for God's sake!
Do you hear?
We told you to get out of here!
Hello, Captain Dumitriu?
Hello, Captain Dumitriu?
Where the hell is he?
Hey children, don't stay here!
Captain Dumitriu.
At your orders, Colonel.
What's going on?
Have you executed my orders?
I await your orders in writing.
Are you mad?
Execute my orders at once and report to my office.
Before or after the execution?
After, after.
I await your orders in writing.
Go to hell!
Squad, stand to attention!
Bugle boy, wake up!
Leap forward! Down!
Leap forward! Down!
Gather at the starting point!
And be quick about it!
About turn!
Down!
- Water the roots.
- They're going to shoot us.
Hang the roots!
- Like this?
- That's it.
Shoot us, shoot us!
Shut it, bird of misfortune.
Yes, that's it.
Water the roots.
And you'll see, it'll grow and grow.
Christian, Betty, inside.
Mummy is calling.
Are you still afraid of us, madam?
Off you go, your mummy's calling you.
Why would I be afraid?
If he wants to be a gardener,
I'll let him.
Hey you, get out of here!
It's better than being a soldier.
I don't want to!
Go away! Go away!
Just get lost!
- Is she your wife?
- Yes, she is.
- She's beautiful.
- You can say that again.
But she can't speak.
She just says my name. Petco.
- Why are we prisoners?
- You're not prisoners!
- What will they do?
- Nothing. They'll let you go.
- Back to your wives.
- I think not.
If you knew how they shouted at us.
They're letting you go and sending you home.
Then you can come back.
Or rather, some of you.
They'll tend the garden, as day labourers.
We'll come back.
I'd like that.
Why do they have bayonets?
Why can't our wives stay?
You don't know soldiers.
They're jealous types.
They're furious because the smugglers killed their comrades.
The smugglers are Macedonian.
We're Bulgarian.
Yes.
- Where are you going?
- Go away!
Want to get shot, do you?
Want him to shoot you?
Go away!
You lot, get lost.
What are you waiting for?
Get lost!
What is going on?
You want an order from the Colonel?
And in writing?
Yes, sir.
I'm giving it to you.
Don't demand it in writing.
I wish to inform you
I need it in writing.
- Who do you...
- Leave us, Colonel.
I'll speak to him.
Look, dear man, do you realise you're jeopardising your career?
You're a remarkable, intelligent, educated officer, which is sadly rare in the Rumanian army.
You studied in Germany, attended the academy and you are up for promotion.
Soon you will lead a regiment.
In war, you will be a general, division or corps commander.
With your Germanic mind,
I can easily see you as a chief of staff, at my age.
Your wife has influential relatives.
Is the Laskari family not in the Queen's inner circle?
You have the scruples of an adolescent who indulges in masturbation.
However, if you refuse, you can forget about promotion.
You will not command in this army.
Not even a regiment.
And you, an officer capable of leading great units in memorable battles, will grow old disgracefully under the command of a cretin like him.
I'm warning you, all the idiots will be promoted and pip you to the post.
You will have to deal with boots and puttees rather than having your name go down in history.
Very well.
I'll give you till this afternoon.
I think we deserve lunch.
Where can one eat well, Captain?
And how is your wife?
Allow me to invite you and the Colonel.
My wife will be delighted.
With pleasure.
And think hard.
You have a swarm of children.
You will take the obvious decision.
I understand perfectly.
I will take the obvious decision.
It is an extraordinary region, an extraordinary people.
The landscapes are extraordinary.
There is an example.
Mont Fuji.
Is it not beautiful?
It is far more beautiful than Mount Fuji.
The Danube at Dobruja is prettier than in the Black Forest?
But it is, I assure you.
A thousand times prettier.
As for the inhabitants...
Bravo, bravo!
Heat that, Colonel?
And you, a real Rumanian, wish to be in the capital?
They live comfortably.
You have a harpsichord.
A harpsichord.
It's for taming the barbarians.
Music changes mores.
The smugglers are in need of it.
A toast, gentlemen.
To the woman who tames the barbarians and turns barren land into lush gardens.
What woman wants,
God wants, Colonel.
In fact, this lettuce, which by the way
I would love more of, is proof of that.
It is absolutely delicious.
Excellent lettuce, woman of Dobruja.
There's quite a story behind it,
I can tell you.
We would not have had any, as the plants were wilted before we got here.
But fortunately, there were all these Bulgarians.
They watered them.
Wassily, have you fed the Bulgarians?
Yes, madam.
You take care of those...
You have sympathy for them?
For those who are unhappy on this land.
You might spare a thought for our poor dead soldiers.
Has anything been done for their families?
Who looks after their families?
The government, madam.
Our government.
It is none of your concern, madam.
And the men behind us, who looks after them?
After all, they are Rumanian.
In the event of war, they serve in the Rumanian army.
Who takes care of them?
The government takes care of them too.
It takes care of them.
Thank you for lunch, madam.
I hope to see you soon.
Captain, I expect you in 10 minutes.
Talk to him, madam.
Make him see reason.
He's terribly stubborn.
You Bulgarian, get to work!
Go on, grab the shovel.
Come on, water the garden.
And be quick about it.
Come on.
It wasn't up to him.
The War Minister phoned Chilibia, who called Telescope, who called the Colonel.
It isn't in writing.
What are you going to do, Petrica?
Mount Fuji!
Shit, shit, shit!
What a pretentious young madam.
And she's Magyar.
Don't pass up this opportunity.
Confidential report:
Telescope is furious.
He's seeing red.
Go on, it's in the bag!
- I get it. Leave me alone.
- Go on, off you go.
Tight arse!
Mount Fuji!
Tight arse!
Tight arse!
Busy.
The General is busy.
Yes, Captain!
Captain, kindly order your wife to change her attitude towards our enemies and also your superiors.
I wish to inform you that as my wife is not a member of the division, she is not obliged to obey orders.
Is she obliged to discuss with you whether to obey orders?
I wish to inform you that no.
I discuss orders with no one.
I execute them.
There. That's better.
Bravo. Excellent.
You're rather complicated, dear man.
How will you deal with the matter?
Not that it is any of my business.
You have free rein.
Telephone me after executing the order.
I shall want a written report.
Escape attempt following smugglers' attack...
Etc., etc., etc.
No, sir!
I wish to remind you,
I need the order in writing.
I see. That is where we are at.
Are you making fun of me?
Colonel, he is no longer in charge.
Henceforth, the Lieutenant will do his job.
As for you, Captain, you are dismissed.
Present arms!
Ground arms!
Mummy, Mummy!
Come here!
Come here at once!
Christian, Betty!
Where are you taking us?
Come on, don't argue.
Come on, fall in! Fall in!
Get a move on. Closer together.
You Bulgarians, forward march.
We're taking you home.
Mummy!
Please, darling.
Don't take us.
- Don't kill us.
- We're innocent.
Shut it, you!
Sir, don't take us.
He's Turkish.
Why are you taking him?
Are Turks worth less?
- Don't take us!
- Stop your snivelling.
Your kind killed our men.
Get up, or I'll kick you in the arse.
Get up!
- We have children.
- So did our men!
Come on, get up. Get up!
Be a man.
Show a bit of courage.
Come along!
My friends, my friends!
Madam, don't abandon us!
They're taking us to our death.
I forbid you to speak to them.
Why get into such a state, Petco?
Where are you going, lads?
I haven't paid you.
I was clear.
You understand Rumanian.
They're going to kill us!
- Don't be so childish.
- They're going to kill us!
Why kill you?
You haven't done anything.
I'm not allowed to speak to you but listen carefully.
Once you're released, come back and I shall pay you.
You'll have everyone's pay.
I need workers for the vegetable garden.
I'll come back.
Come along.
- Stop begging them.
- Shut it, shut it!
Come on, move it!
Thank you, madam.
Get going.
Faster, come on. Move it.
Look lively!
Come on, move it.
Move it, fatso.
What are you looking at?
Look lively!
Come on, faster.
Faster, faster.
This lettuce is wilted and rotten.
It's only fit for the pigs.
They can eat it!
Your service record, Captain, says you're capable.
- Is your wife a communist?
- General?
Are you deaf, Captain, or being stupid?
Must I repeat myself?
Is your wife a Bolshevik?
I wish to inform you
I do not understand.
My wife's mother...
Are you acting stupid or are you dumb?
I'm interested in your wife!
Where did you meet?
In 1919, in Budapest, you were in my division.
There was a revolution.
We burnt the red flag of Bela Kun, did we not?
No. My wife is not a communist.
Her mother...
Screw her mother!
For God's sake, why does she defend those yokels?
Here are two confidential reports.
There are two bastards in my company.
It isn't your company anymore.
The bastard is the officer who married a Magyar, the sworn enemy of our nation!
My wife's mother...
...an order from the government.
I'm in a fix.
The ministry wonders,
"Among Chilibia's men, are there cases of insubordination?"
- My wife's mother...
- You will be court-martialled.
Your file will be so full of negative remarks that you'll run from one garrison to another like a top, with broken furniture and empty trunks.
You have a harpsichord?
Don't touch it!
It belongs to my...
I don't give a fuck about your harpsichord!
I'll tell your superiors to give you hell.
They'll have your guts for garters.
When you retire, you'll still be a dumb captain, a stupid old fogey!
I wish to inform you my wife is not Magyar.
Her mother is Sophia Laskari, a Rumanian boyar.
You don't say!
What's her father's name?
Who cares?
Her mother is Sophia Laskari!
Go to hell, you fool!
- May I...
- Get out of here!
Do you want it in writing?
With all due respect, sir.
I have been meaning to ask you this for a while.
Hergie...
You know, Hergie the whore.
Is she not well acquainted with Marie-Thérèse Dumitriu?
They belong to the same branch.
I mean, from the same town.
Budapest.
What's wrong?
Want to challenge me to a duel?
I'm sorry, Captain.
It will be our little secret.
It's mere curiosity.
Maybe I shouldn't have.
But don't take it badly.
I can apologise.
Accept my apologies.
You are to join the 90th infantry regiment.
Goodnight.
You are dismissed.
Petco. Petco!
Faster, Wassily!
Come on!
Mummy, when will Petco come back?
Take him.
Run!
"Mummy?"
"Mummy, when will Petco come back?"
I asked the next day and the day after.
My mother did not reply.
Then she took to drink and I forgot about Petco.
But I never forgot that summer.
It was an extraordinary summer.
The best summer of my childhood.

You may hear the bombs now.
If you’re still with us, you can hear the bombs now.
They are hitting the centre of the city.
[Second reporter]
Now we can hear explosions...
..off in the distance to the west of central Baghdad.
Clearly I've never been there,...
..but this feels like we 're in the centre of hell.
[President Bush] The 28 countries...
..with forces in the Gulf area...
..have exhausted all reasonable efforts...
..to reach a peaceful resolution,...
..have no choice...
..but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force.
[Iraqi spokesman]
A great battle has been initiated.
The mother of all battles.
[Bush] Our objectives...
..in the Persian Gulf area clear,...
..our goals defined.
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait...
..completely, immediately,...
..and without condition.
[Bush] The liberation of Kuwait...
..has now entered a final phase.
I have therefore directed to use all forces available,...
..including ground forces,...
..to eject the Iraqi army from Kuwait.
[Peter Arnett]
At this point it seems inevitable...
..that the ground war is only hours away.
Peter Arnett, Baghdad.
Don't ever for one minute underestimate the enemy,...
..but remember, we're better soldiers.
We're fighting with better equipment, we're better trained and a lot smarter.
Sleep deprivation.
Our soldiers been up 46, 48 hours,...
..so stay on top of 'em.
Maintain your intervals.
Any questions?
Let's have a Little prayer.
Dear God, protect us...
..as we protect our country we so dearly Love.
Keep us safe that we’ll all get home to see our families and our children.
Amen.
Amen.
- Let's kill 'em all.
- [all] Hu-ah!
You all right, Boylar?
Hell, yeah.
- Let's heat 'em up, Nat.
- See you in Baghdad.
Yes, sir.
Battle-carry Sabot.
Sabot bullet coming up, sir.
- Sabot loaded.
- Indexed.
Crew report.
- Driver ready.
- Loader ready.
Gunner ready to give Saddam a new way to hurt.
- Hu-ah!
- Hu-ah!
Hu-ah.
All right, Boylar?
Roger that.
All Cougar elements, this is Cougar-6.
Report Red Con 1. Over.
All Sabre elements, this is Sabre-6.
Move out.
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
No joy over here.
Permission to try an alternate route. Over.
Roger that, Cougar-6.
Work your way to phase line hammer.
- [Nat] No surprises. Copy?
- Roger that.
I'm taking up the right flank.
I’ll get back to you. Out.
Contact. I see flashes, 3,500 metres, sir.
- All right.
- Hold on. They got no range.
2,500 metres and closing, sir.
Ready to lase and blaze.
Contact, sir. He's in range.
- Come on, let me kill his ass.
- Fire!
On the way!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Find me another target, Patella.
- Loaded!
- Identified.
- Fire.
Fire!
[Patella] Got him! We got him!
Sabre-6, Liberty-6.
We got enemy tangos retreating...
..vicinity grid 2-4-9er-8.
Your pursuit should intercept their retreat, grid 7-6-5.
Roger that, Liberty-6.
- Troops!
- Troops!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Come on! Come on!
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
Go ahead, Cougar-6.
I have got mines. Repeat, mines.
I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[Nat] Work your way to grid-line Charlie.
Cougar-6 to all Cougar elements.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Whoa! What the...
Oh, shit!
All Sabre units, this is Sabre-6.
We just lost a tank.
Anybody see the shooter?
- I didn't see anything.
- Where they coming from?
Who the hell is shooting at us?
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks...
..retreating grid 7-6...
- Patella, that one of our tanks?
- Hard to tell.
Make it out, and fast!
Oh, shit! We're almost browning out.
Nat, what's happening?
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks on our flank. We have contact.
This is Cougar-6.
Enemy tangos at phase line delta. Over.
- Patella, find me a target.
- I think I got one, sir.
Do you or do you not have a target?
I think so!
Gunner, Sabot, tank.
Identify! Up!
Fire!
He just fired, sir.
They're firing at us!
- Loader!
- Up, sir!
Fire!
Yeah! That's the one!
All right.
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.
- We got him.
- Sabre, you just lit up a friendly!
I heard you! We... what?
Oh, my God.
You just lit up Boylar, goddamn it!
Sabre-6, Nat, what's happening?
Patella, was that one of our tanks?
He fired, sir.
At us or at the T-72s?
I don't know.
At us or at the T-72s?
I don't know!
[Patella] Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Colonel Serling, report status now.
They have range on us, sir.
Sir!
Oh, Christ, Colonel...
I gave the order to fire.
So with your thermal equipment,...
..confused by burning tanks and smoke obscuring your visual ID,...
..you couldn't tell the difference between the T-54 and the Abrams.
I believe that, uh, we...
I should have known the difference,...
..even with the night scope.
If we weren't under attack,...
But, under the circumstances, there was no way to tell the difference.
Under the circumstances,...
..I suppose there was no way to tell the difference, but...
There was no way to tell the difference.
Thank you, Colonel.
That's all we need.
[Patella] We’re almost browning out!
[Boylar] We got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.
Aah!
We just lost Cougar-6!
You just lit up a friendly!
Colonel Serling?
Yes.
You OK? Can I get you something?
Yes, I'm fine. Fine.
Uh, yes, you can get me a cup of coffee.
You got it.
We missed you and Meredith at Banacek's party last night.
I'm too old to dance with you youngsters.
Meredith's not, so tell her to come without you next time.
Oh, OK. I will do just that...
..next time.
Colonel Serling.
- Hershberg in five. Coffee's coming.
- Thanks.
Yes.
Washington Post?
About?
Yes, I was there.
That's a matter of public record.
Well, thank you very much, Mr...
Gartner. Thank you, Mr Gartner, but I have nothing to say.
No, sir.
No, sir!
Well, I’ll do just that.
Right.
Colonel Serling's here, sir.
Ban.
I'm not talking to you.
Won't even come to my anniversary party?
You and Sylvia have been together, what, a month?
The way she danced with that marine, it won't last another week.
It may be my last anniversary party.
Were you there for me?
What's up?
Hey, Nat.
I've got to talk to you.
How we holding, Ban?
Running late, sir.
- May I run a few things by you, sir?
- Quickly.
Lieutenant Boylar's parents...
Boylar?
Tom Boylar. He died in AI Bathra.
He'd been with me a long time.
- From Virginia, right?
- Roger that, sir.
His parents have written to me.
They're hearing rumours.
You know we can't discuss it.
You have to put them off.
- Yes, sir, but...
- Tell them he died in action.
He's a hero. That's all they want to know.
Roger, but it's not just his parents.
We got a call...
..from the Washington Post.
A reporter named Gartner.
A reporter called you about AI Bathra?
You didn't talk?
Of course not.
Nobody’ll hang you out to dry.
I won't let 'em.
Did you listen to the tape, sir?
Colonel, the war's over.
You and I have been given the great responsibility and privilege...
..of investigating combat medals for our army.
In other words, we've been passed over.
I prefer to think of it as a second chance, Nat.
We understand each other?
Yes, sir.
OK.
The White House heard we're considering the Medal of Honour for a chopper pilot...
..who saved some guys on a downed Blackhawk.
- Naturally they want it for Veterans Day.
- Naturally.
Which is why you're taking over the inquiry.
We've got the rescued soldiers in there for debriefing.
Attention.
Morning. Take your seats.
Everything in order?
- Just going over the sequence of events.
- Bring Colonel Serling up to speed.
Morning, sir.
Good to see you again.
Could we get a picture of you and the survivors?
No, thank you.
- Keep me in the loop.
- Thank you, sir.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Doug Bruno, White House.
Do everything my way and we’ll be fine.
Nat Serling.
I’ll, uh, get out of your way.
- Major.
- Sir.
25 February, these men were part of a refueling convoy.
Their Blackhawk was shot down by an SA-7 west of Al Kufan.
Five seconds after it locked on, we were down.
We didn't know what hit us.
Our lines were surrounding them so fast,...
..we got caught in a pocket of resistance.
Iraqi ground troops on the ridge above kept them completely pinned down.
Did you discuss surrendering?
Yes, sir, we did.
We were all wounded one way or another.
We weren't trained for that kind of situation, sir.
Don't have to make excuses to me.
Go on, Sam.
That's all we got so far, sir.
OK.
- Lieutenant Chelli.
- Yes, sir.
Well, as if things weren't bad enough already,...
..one of their T-54s...
..joins the ragheads up on the ridge.
Incoming! Get down!
That round kills the medic, Relleno, Gerspach,...
..and, uh, Egan here lost his leg.
So we figure that's it. We're dead.
But then we hear it.
Nothing like the sound of an inbound Huey.
Yeah!
Yeah!
[Serling] This Huey, did it take any fire?
Right off the bat.
But this time when the Huey comes back, it returns fire.
Ground troops go for cover.
Then the Huey circles back over the tank...
That's when they threw something overboard.
- Threw something, or something fell off?
- I couldn't tell, but the tank blew.
Oh!
Yeah!
Man, did it ever blow!
We, uh, we never did see what knocked the Huey down.
We couldn't see the crash.
That night we caught sporadic ground fire.
The Huey was down below, between us and the enemy,...
..so they caught most of it.
Any communications between you and them?
No, sir. As I said, our radio was wasted.
Shouting just draws enemy fire.
So the Iraqis, they start to close in on the Huey...
..under cover fire,...
..and the Huey returns fire.
We figure it's all over, and that's when we hear the rescue team.
Cobras, Hueys...
And a big-ass A-10 Thunderbolt.
I swear I never heard such a sweet sound.
But now the fuckers are...
I'm sorry, sir.
The Iraqis are letting loose with all they got.
You were right the first time.
Plus the Huey crew is still banging away.
We load our wounded aboard,...
..and that's when somebody decided to leave the dead.
I guess it was the commander of the rescue.
Mm-hmm.
And this... Huey crew,...
.they, uh, they returned fire all through the final rescue?
Yes, sir. I... I think so.
I couldn't see much, though.
I heard it.
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not no A-K or M-60.
I heard it, too.
The last thing we see is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm on the downed choppers.
I don't know if it was Captain Walden...
..but that Huey...
..saved our lives.
It sure sounds like it.
OK.
Thank you for your help.
I’ll look over your statements.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Colonel.
That’ll be all.
- Got something for me?
- I do, sir.
Walden's 201 file. Evaluation reports.
You know I'm going to need background on these guys.
Make sure we don't have a wife-beater or an illegal Allen or gays.
That’ll blow it.
About this Congressional Medal of Honour.
It's not the Congressional Medal of
Honour. It's just the Medal of Honour.
Tell that to Congress.
If Captain Walden wins this medal...
You don't win it. You, uh, receive it.
It's not a contest.
But that is perfect. That is why I'm here.
I'm not here to get down your throat, make you crazy,...
..take these facts and twist them.
I just want to get these nuances out of your head and to get it straight from you.
- It's a woman.
- You didn't know?
What did you think the hoopla was about?
Banacek's got information on three of Walden's men.
- The crew chief we're still tracking.
- This is Captain Karen Emma Walden.
She's the first woman ever to be nominated for a Medal of Honour for combat.
I mean, this is gold.
It's gold.
Unfortunately it's posthumous,...
..but I've got her Little daughter.
I got the President of the United States.
It's all set in the Rose Garden.
The President's going to lean down and hang that ribbon round that pretty face.
There is not going to be a dry eye from Nashua to Sacramento.
Excuse us.
OK, it was 5 to 1,...
..hook shot.
Me and her are cheerleaders.
- More mashed potatoes.
- [Woman] Sorry, no more potatoes,...
..but how about some bread?
Aah!
[Boylar] Aah!
Daddy, can I have your mashed potatoes?
Daddy?
Sir?
Can I have your mashed potatoes?
M... Yeah. Sure.
Yeah,...
..soldier.
You want 'em all?
That enough?
More?
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, who is calling, please?
Just a minute.
It's for you.
Who is it?
Somebody Gartner.
Want some more peas?
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
Fort Hood.
General Hershberg's got me investigating a Medal of Honour.
It's a woman.
Good for her.
Posthumous.
Too bad, but still good for her.
Mmm. Too bad.
You talk to the investigators today?
Right.
It's all right, isn't it, Nat?
Yeah. Fine.
How long are you gone for?
Couple of days.
Then why are you emptying your sock drawer?
I may be gone more than a couple of days.
Nat.
Yes.
I don't know what's happening.
Everything's fine.
I'm handling it.
[Nat] Mr. Rady, you were Captain Walden's copilot.
That's right.
[Nat] Can you tell me what you remember about Al Kufan?
I remember the earth.
I remember... llario's face.
I wish...
- She hadn't needed to be a hero so bad.
- That's not fair.
We were just doing our job.
It's not Ren's fault I got hit.
She sure as hell saved the lives of those guys on the Blackhawk.
- You always defend her.
- Why didn't you like her?
She was so butch.
Honey, shut up.
She was, you know.
One of those women who want to be officers...
Annie, shut up.
She gave her life for those men.
She was a soldier.
There she blows.
- We're taking fire!
- Holy shit!
- Kill that motherfucker, Bonfires!
- I may as well be pissing on him.
- We need a fucking air strike!
- We got no fucking bomb!
- Making another pass, Ran?
- Yep.
No! We should go for altitude, and call for support.
After we slow down that tank!
- How we gonna do that?
- Shut up and listen, soldier!
Altameyer, unhook the aux fuel bladder port side.
Get ready to push it overboard.
Push it overboard, ma'am? llario, unhook the flare gun!
What the fuck...
Do it!
It's a bomb, asshole!
Target coming up!
Gimme more!
Ready here!
- Got it?
- I got it!
Tell us when you're there!
He’ll kick it!
Allow for the speed of the craft!
- The pod will drop at the same velocity!
- He knows.
Pick your moment!
Now!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Whoa! Shit!
Whoa! Oh, God!
Hang on, llario! Grab a hold of me!
Don't let go of me! Pull me in!
Hang on.
Come on, llario! Pull yourself up!
Do something!
No! No! Rady, call in a Mayday! llario,... call it in!
[Ilario]
Mayday! Dustoff-3... we are going down!
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! Mayday! Mayday!
This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We are going down!
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!
We're going down! Oh, my God...
That's it.
I woke up three days later on a hospital ship.
Nearly bought it, that's sure.
[Larry King] When did you decide the type of career in the Army you wanted?
[Schwarzkopf] That happened about my third year at West Point when I was...
I could have gone in the Air Force.
I stood high enough in my class.
You can't get away from that guy.
He's everywhere.
- Hell of a soldier, though.
- You think so?
I know so.
Really. How?
I was with him in the Gulf.
No shit.
- Doing what?
- Armoured cavalry.
Hu-ah.
Hu-ah.
Once upon a time,
I was humping in the delta.
- With who?
- The 9 Th.
- You kicked some serious butt.
- That's right.
- One for my friend...
- Colonel Nat Serling.
Make it a double for Colonel Serling.
Tony Gartner, Washington Post.
They won't find any criminal culpability in the AI Bathra incident.
You got nothing to worry about.
Those were my men.
I put that badly. I'm sorry.
Look, I went to Virginia and spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Boylar.
You what?
I'm sorry, but they got a right to know what happened to their son.
I’ll take that.
[Serling] And this
Huey crew, they, uh, returned fire all through the final rescue?
[Chelli] Yes, sir. I think so.
I couldn't see much.
[Thompson] I heard it.
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not know A-K or M-60.
[Egan] I heard it, too.
[Chelli] Last thing we see is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm...
..on the two downed choppers.
Oh!
Sir!
All right, this is anti-fungal cream,...
..but to kill the athlete's foot when you're in the shower, just piss on your feet.
That's disgusting.
What've you got for me today?
You want to get rid of the allergies to bee pollen, then no caffeine, no chocolate.
Jesus. I give up coffee, you can bury me now.
- Morning, Colonel.
- Morning. You got some aspirins?
How many do you want?
I take eight every day.
Four's good.
- I need to talk to you, Specialist.
- Sir?
I'm investigating the recommendation to award a Medal of Honour to Captain Walden.
Rowtero?
Yeah?
Can you cover for me?
I'm going to go feed the cancer genes.
Do you really need to, uh, I mean...
It's fine.
Uh, what do you want to know?
How long were you with Captain Walden?
Um... over... over two years.
Quite a long time.
Yeah.
You were her medic.
Yes, sir.
I don't fly any more though.
Well, don't miss it, do you?
Never.
Never again.
That's quite a habit you got.
Yeah, it's, uh...
..one of the few things I can call my own.
So...
..tell me what happened at AI Kufan.
See, I'd, uh...
..I'd never been in... in combat.
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down!
Mayday! This is Dustoff-3... llario?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Rady's hurt.
Monfriez?
AItameyer?
Functioning.
Fire in the hold!
[Ilario] Come here, buddy.
This is Dustoff-3.
Acknowledge.
This is Dustoff-3.
Here. Come on.
This is Dustoff-3.
Come on.
Dustoff-3. Acknowledge.
AItameyer, how's that fire?
Under control. Fuel tank's intact.
Enemy at the back door!
Come on! Come on!
Monfriez, get that saw working!
Come on! Get down!
I've got the M-16! llario?
He's bad. It's the lung.
We gotta get him out of here.
- Head wound?
- Superficial. How's the radio?
Dead. So's the ADT.
Monfriez, easy on the ammo!
We might be here a while!
Captain!
You've seen me do this a million times.
You’ll be fine.
Ammo?
I got this belt and three more boxes.
OK, AItameyer, rip out everything you can from the inside.
We're gonna make a perimeter.
Monfriez, cover us!
Go!
Where's our Kevlar?
I got one!
Well, put it on!
Unh. How's he doing?
He's the same.
I need a hook.
As soon as it gets dark, we dig in.
Then we wait.
For what?
For the good guys.
You won't think it's so funny when I nail your fucking ass!
Yeah, they were laughing.
You about, uh... You done?
So tell me what happened...
..during the night.
You were there. You saw the nights.
You know, just... it was black.
Just... black.
Tell me what happened that night.
Well, she put us on two-hour watches.
Um... it's not like any of us were going to sleep anyway.
[Monfriez]
Head down, AItameyer. You might lose it.
You OK, Captain?
Shit in my eye.
Will our guys come tonight?
They’ll be here.
Dust is blowing pretty bad.
I don't know how much longer Rady can hang on.
I can hear the rag heads when you're not gabbing.
Then I'd suggest everybody just...
They're going away.
It was just a probe. llario?
I'm OK.
AItameyer?
My ear!
Monfriez?
I... I took one.
- Rady?
- Hanging in. How about you, Cap?
Unh...
Oh, shit.
Stay with Rady.
I like to come here.
It's not just the bikinis, although they ain't bad.
It's these kids.
I like to watch them, you know?
My folks had this place out on Calaveras Lake.
I still go there sometimes, watch 'em dive.
They do the damnedest things.
They never think about the consequences.
Imagine that.
Imagine not thinking about the consequences?
Imagine that.
Are... are we done?
After the attack...
..during the night...
What?
I mean, we waited.
I... I still don't...
- I... I don't know what you...
- Just go on with what happened.
Well, Karen,... the captain,... uh, was hurt pretty bad.
Ohh...
Unh...
Unh!
How many rounds left?
Just a sec.
How many rounds?
I just opened my last can of ammo.
Five mags for the M-16,...
..9-mll's full.
Mine's empty.
Fire a couple of rounds off.
- Let 'em know we're still alive.
- Roger that, Captain.
Now save your ammo for something you can see.
During the course of the incident, did she display any doubt, any fear...
..when she had to make these life-and-death decisions?
No.
No. Never.
She just made 'em.
Just like that?
Just like that.
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.
The heavier the pressure, the calmer she got.
We knew they were out there,...
..sneaking up on us.
But we also knew at first light they were going to attack.
I don't know why people think only good things happen when the sun rises.
Incoming!
How many?
100. Maybe more.
Any good at hand-to-hand?
Wait till they get closer.
Make every round count!
- Shit!
- Quiet!
What in Christ for?
They know we're here!
Quiet! I hear something!
Choppers!
Hey!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Go! Go!
Yeah!
Let's get out of here! llario, get the captain!
There's the rescue!
Help Rady!
Pick him up!
Go! Let's go! Let go! Let's go!
Come on! Let's move! Move it!
Gotta go! We gotta go!
Come back for me with a stretcher!
Go! llario, let's get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
Aah!
Aah!
Medic!
Come on! Get him up!
Move! Come on! Let's go!
Where's Walden?
Captain Walden is dead.
Strike leader, this is Dustoff-6.
We have all the friends.
You're clear and hot.
Roger, Dustoff-6. Going on down.
So...
Is she gonna get it?
Is she gonna get the medal?
Well, I sincerely hope so.
I just... I don't want to tell that story again.
Not one more time.
Yeah, I understand.
May I be excused?
Yes, you can.
Oh, one more thing I'm confused about.
This M-16...
What?
Did it run out of ammo?
Uh, what did I say?
I don't remember. That's why I'm asking.
I guess, uh...
I guess it ran out of ammo sometime during the morning.
Um...
Or, no, sometime during the night...
I don't know.
See, the Blackhawk crew said they heard M-16 fire...
..during the rescue that morning.
Did they?
That's right.
Must've been wrong, then.
Them or you?
Who, them or you?
Oh, them. Them, yeah.
No, they must have been wrong.
OK.
OK.
What about the letter?
A what?
You and Walden traded letters to send home in case anything happened to you.
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.
So, who was hers to?
Her folks.
- So you sent it?
- Yeah.
Her folks, they're good people.
They got a farm out in Abilene.
They'd come to Hood, look after her kid while we went out on exercises.
Yeah... Yeah.
OK.
Thank you, Specialist.
Thank you very much, sir.
I read somewhere...
..that if a child doesn't see a person die,...
..or dead, like in a casket,...
..that the person isn't really dead for them.
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
Yes, ma'am.
It was, uh... unusual, wasn't it,...
..for Karen to want to be a helicopter pilot?
I guess that's my fault.
I took her to the fair when she was 11.
12 - 7th grade.
Anyway, there was a helicopter there.
Small one with a bubble up front.
The fella... the pilot was selling rides.
I bought Karen a ticket.
It was a short ride.
But when she came down...
Well, I don't think she ever came down, actually.
She showed up at the dinner table one day,...
..just after she finished TCU.
She's joined the Army.
She wants to fly helicopters.
She's real stubborn about it, too.
That's our Karen, you know, stubborn.
So's Anne Marie here.
Come here, honey.
Excuse me.
Uh, the young men,...
..the ones that came to tell us about Karen...
..they were dressed just like you.
Oh, I see.
Major Teegarden,...
..her commanding officer, he came, too, when he came back from the Gulf.
Brought this photo back for Anne Marie.
Meant a lot to us...
..him coming to see us,...
..telling us in person how Karen died.
I lost men over there, too.
I spoke to the major.
Everybody thought the world of your daughter. So did Specialist llario.
It would sure help if I could see her letter.
I mean, if it's not too private.
Letter?
From llario?
I’ll check my notes. Must be my mistake.
This her husband here?
No. That's Karen's older brother Billy.
Her husband's up in Michigan.
He and Karen divorced after only a year or so.
He never... well,... it was no picnic.
Karen raised Anne Marie on her own.
We'd have been thrilled to have
Anne Marie with us all the time,...
..what with the Army and all.
But Karen was a real good mom.
Never asked for help unless she really needed it.
You can't imagine how hard it was for her...
..to go off and leave that Little girl to fight in a war,...
..but it was important to Karen to do her duty.
So she went.
You've been out here 20 minutes since I spotted you.
- How much longer before that?
I see you, uh...
..got the new refrigerator.
Do you think the kids will understand why their daddy is out here in a Chevy...
..instead of playing with them in the front yard?
Or at Fort Hood, like you told me you were?
Are you back?
I'm in transit.
You know, Nat, it took me a long time...
..to figure out how to be an Army wife without obliterating myself.
It wasn't easy, but I did it.
I know you did, Mer.
So it wouldn't be a hardship for me...
..to learn how not to be an Army wife...
..if my husband wasn't in the Army any more.
The Army's my life, Mer.
And so are we.
You don't have to figure it all out, Nat.
You just have to admit that you can't.
You have to want to be here with us,...
..that's all.
We’ll be here.
For a while.
Now go away.
If you're not going to stay,
I don't want the kids to see you.
This M-16, did it run out of ammo?
[Woman] Yes, sir?
- Colonel Serling, you can go in now.
- I don',t remember...
Hey, Nat, what's up?
General.
It's the Walden file, sir.
One or two discrepancies.
Discrepancies?
Yes, sir.
I knew those White House clowns were up to something.
If she doesn't deserve it, she won't get it.
It's not Captain Walden, sir.
It's some of the details of the stories
I'm getting from her crew.
- I don't know how significant...
- I'm drowning in paper here.
They're crawling all over my ass for combat assessments,...
Sir, I just wanted to let you know this is not a rubber-stamp situation, that's all.
Now, this specialist, uh, llario, there's something funny about his story.
We're not giving the medal to llario.
We're giving it to Walden.
Roger.
Splendid. Move forward.
OK. The discrepancies specifically relate to... use of an M-16 rifle...
Come on, Nat! No two eyewitnesses ever agree on every detail.
You know that as well as I do.
When do we get that report?
I want the White House off my back.
A few days, sir.
You agree that this report should be as detailed and accurate as possible?
Which means exactly what, Colonel?
Which means exactly what I said, sir.
Sorry, sir. This is the second copy of Colonel Serling's AI Bathra deposition.
The investigator seemed to have misplaced the last one.
Rise above.
This will all be over soon.
Will there be a public statement of the facts...
..when the investigation is over, sir?
There's been a decision not to release any findings until every case...
..has been thoroughly reviewed.
Well, how long do you imagine that will be, sir?
I mean, next time I see
Lieutenant Boylar's parents, I'd like to tell them the whole truth.
You know how many grieving parents
I had to deal with during Vietnam?
This is not Vietnam.
Lieutenant Boylar's tank was hit by uranium-depleted shells.
We're the only country in the world that uses them.
We got reporters from the Washington Post looking for the truth,...
..and the only person that knows it can't say it...
..because these investigators are dragging their backsides!
Someone has got to be accountable for this,... sir.
Take a seat.
Nat, I'm going to give you all the rope in the world.
First you imply I'm not interested...
..in an accurate report on Captain Walden.
Now you're suggesting there must be some cover-up going on about AI Bathra.
So how do you want me to respond?
As your commanding officer,...
..or as your friend who nursed you, pushed promotions,...
..and fucking burped your kids at their baptisms?
Just how should I respond?
I'm sorry, sir.
I should hope by God you would be.
Now,...
..losing a man like your friend Boylar,...
..I've been there.
Well, this...
..whole mess...
It's my ass on the line right there beside yours.
I can feel the chilling the air as well as you can.
Yes, sir.
And I know about the drinking.
And if I have to write you up,...
..it’ll just be one more bite out of your record.
Clean it up.
Get yourself in a programme.
I’ll be looking for that report.
Soon.
[Nat] Yes, this is the Serling residence.
[Mer] We’re nothing right now...
- But at the tone, leave a message and...
- [Kids] We’ll call you when we get home.
You better get your head into this!
I'm going to drop you from this programme like a hot rock!
You better hurry up!
Morning, sir. Monfriez is over there.
I’ll get him for you.
Thank you.
What the fuck are you doing, soldier?
Where are your men?
- There, sir.
- Yeah? What do you call that?
You see that man?
You and he are brothers.
He depends on you. You depend on him.
You never leave a man behind.
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Now get the fuck out of here.
[Nat] You were in Panama?
Yes, sir.
Were you there, sir?
Yes, I was.
And you were also in Desert Storm?
Roger that, sir.
How'd you come to be on Captain Walden's chopper?
I used to hang around the medivac unit.
Wanted to be a medic?
Wanted to hump a nurse once.
That count, sir?
See, I play poker.
Those medivac folks, between missions, had a lot of time on their hands.
Want to know a poker secret, sir?
Always.
The people you play against, find out what they're interested in.
Pretend you're interested.
They start running off at the mouth, don't pay attention to their cards.
Medevac folks, they Love to talk about their choppers.
Paid for this baby.
So, talk to me about, um,...
..25 February.
25 February? Yes, sir.
I had some phys rehab time.
Got into boxing.
Want a soda pop?
No, sir. No, I'm good.
25 February.
So, 25 February...
Major, uh, what's his butt?
Garden party...
Teegarden. Major Teegarden.
Right. Asked me to go with Walden, said she might need guns,...
..so I said, you know, OK, why not?
Grabbed me a saw, bungeed one of the Huey doorways and away we went.
Yeah.
And, uh...
..the captain was a big hero...
She died tragically in the desert, and Major...
- Teegarden.
- Teegarden...
..wants her to get the Medal of Honour, so she’ll get it.
When did the M-16 ammo run out?
What?
M-16 ammo?
Blackhawk crew said they heard M-16 fire during the rescue.
When did it run out?
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
You wouldn't?
As... as I recall, and, uh...
..I'm not really sure,...
..but the M-16 ammo ran out first thing in the morning.
First thing in the morning.
But you're not really sure?
Now I'm confused.
- You were there, weren't you?
- Affirmative, sir.
But I was on the saw.
AItameyer would know, sir.
AItameyer?
- Yes, sir. He was manning the M-16.
- Oh, I see. OK.
OK, let's back up, then.
Um,...
..when that tank fired on your chopper,...
..you said that, uh...
..''You should go for altitude and call for support'', right?
Sir?
You knew this wasn't Panama.
Men were going to die, so you wanted to get out, right?
Wh... who told you that, sir?
Tea Party? llario?
It doesn't matter who told me that.
You tell me.
You don't want to know what happened out there, sir.
Yes, I do.
You just want me to sign off on the story...
..so you can finish your job and the lady can get her medal.
Are you refusing to tell me?
Colonel, you know what to do if you get a hang fire...
..when you pull the trigger and the round doesn't go off?
You wait, with your weapon pointed in a safe direction, cos the primer burns slow.
You open your weapon and take the round out,...
..it blows up in your face.
Leave this round in the chamber, Colonel.
I work at the Pentagon, Sergeant,...
..so I admit I'm a Little slow on the uptake.
Otherwise I'd say you just threatened me.
Did you just threaten me, soldier?
Because, if you did, let me respond to you.
Let me respond to you this way.
I'm an officer, and therefore, by proclamation, a gentleman,...
..but don't abuse that, son.
Don't get in my cross hairs, because I’ll have no compunction...
..about getting up to my neck in your ass, understand?
She was afraid, Colonel.
That's the bottom line on Captain Walden.
She was a fucking coward, sir.
Get me around so I can fire!
- Go back. Let me have another shot!
- I don't know.
I'm going for altitude, call for support.
There's no time!
All right, one more!
But then I'm calling for support.
Unhook the aux fuel cells!
Prepare to toss them overboard. llario, get me the flare gun.
So it was your idea to use the fuel cell?
Yeah.
Me, Rady, somebody.
Adrenaline was pumping. You can't expect me to remember everything.
Try.
Now!
- Yay!
- Whoo!
So what happened during the night?
Walden and llario,...
..they wouldn't shut up about being rescued.
Like the Army had nothing else to do.
Dust is blowing hard out there.
- Think they’ll find us tonight?
- AWACS lost us when the ADT got hit.
SOP is for search and rescue to begin looking...
Christ, Captain, are you crying?
It's OK. It's just tension.
Hey, you're going to be OK, OK?
They’ll find us. It’ll be OK.
I can hear the rag heads moving, as soon as you girls stop gabbing.
They're going away.
It was just a probe.
- Shit!
- I'm OK.
- [Monfriez] I took one.
- How's Rady?
Hanging in. Captain?
Ah! Oh!
So the rest of the night went without incident?
Yeah.
Wasn't that enough for one night?
You want to continue this tomorrow?
I don't get emotional about this shit.
I've been there, you know?
OK. Go on.
Well, after the firefight, we argued mainly. llario was freaked out by the dark, and
Walden wanted to surrender at first light.
She was a wreck, kept asking about the ammo, worrying we didn't have enough.
I knew they'd attack at dawn.
So what happened during the evacuation?
Evacuation.
All right, let's go.
There's the rescue.
AItameyer, give me a hand with Rady.
- Come on, Captain!
- Ow!
Come on!
- No! Don't move me!
- Get away!
Suck it up!
I got you covered! Ready?
Go! Go! Go!
- llario, move!
- Not without the Captain!
I’ll get her.
No! I'm not leaving!
I'm not leaving! It's not safe!
They're taking fire!
The choppers are waiting!
No! No! No!
Get the fuck outta here!
Come on!
She fired at you?
Near us, yeah.
Then why did you lie to the investigators about how she performed?
They'd already put together their own bullshit version of the story...
..before they talked to me. I told them what they wanted to hear. We all did.
But that's the truth, so forget about the medal, or leave it as it is.
I don't give a fuck.
So nobody from your Huey crew fired an M-16 any time during the rescue?
That's affirmed, sir.
Monfriez, you ready?
You sure about that?
That's affirmative, sir.
We had no ammo.
So how about it, Colonel?
Want to go a few rounds?
Are you threatening me, soldier?
- Where's your brain bucket?
- I don't need it.
Don't step in here without one.
I have to tell you again, you won't have a head to stick it on.
Come on, Jersey. Right here.
Let's see what you got.
You got nothing, man.
Come on!
- [Meredith] Hello.
- Hello? Baby?
How're you doing?
Hi.
How's it going?
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
I was calling, I wondered...
What... what kind of...
What size T-shirts the kids wear?
I want to get the kids some T-shirts.
You know their sizes as well as I do.
Are you OK?
Nat?
I got a pint of, um...
..Scotch here in a paper bag.
I don't want to drink any of it.
Can you tell me why you need it?
Want me to prattle on for a minute?
I can do that.
[Nat] Please.
OK. Um...
The new refrigerator doesn't work.
The light doesn't come on when you open the door.
I had to drive all the way over to Wagner, 12 blocks,...
..just so that Brian could practice riding his bike.
He's afraid of falling in front of his friends.
He refuses to let anyone see him riding with training wheels.
They've both taken to sleeping in our bed since you left.
It's like sleeping between two tornadoes.
I better go, baby.
Don Boylar called.
Jesus.
I better go.
- Nat, talk to me.
- I can't.
- Why not?
- I can't!
Bullshit. Bull! Talk to me!
Oh, Christ.
Colonel?
Colonel?
Can we get some coffee, please?
You're not a happy man.
A woman? The Army?
AI Bathra?
Talk to me.
Off the record, if you want.
Way, way off the record.
Rangers' honour.
Serling,...
How long you been back?
Six months.
And you... you've been in the service how long?
17 years.
Ah, they got me running this inquiry...
..on this girl pilot.
Captain Karen Walden.
She’ll be the first woman to get the Medal of Honour for combat.
Oh, boy.
And everybody in the beltway wants a piece of this one, right?
I just want to get something clear.
This time, just want somebody to be a hero.
I want to get something right.
Yeah.
Cos AI Bathra, you know...
AI Bathra.
You talked to Boylar's parents?
Yeah.
Do they know?
They heard from a few of his friends.
Aw, Jesus...
You know...
They told Boylar's parents he died from enemy fire.
I told them that.
I carried the message, went to the funeral,...
..watched his mother cry her eyes out.
I stood there and looked his father in the eye...
..and told him his son died brave under fire.
And I was the one who gave the order to fire.
I did it.
Then the Army gave me a medal...
..for bravery and valor.
Then they buried me...
..in medals.
Got a sense of humour, don't they?
Yeah.
Can't remember anything else except being in the Army.
Either being in it or wanting to be in it.
It's all I know.
Look, you need to sleep.
You call me any time.
Anything you want to say about anything, on or off the record.
I'm going to leave you alone for a while. llario. Are you saying you can't find him, or that he's absent without leave?
[Man] Sir, that’s an I... I...
That's right, specialist llario.
Well, we contacted the MPs, sir...
Roger.
Roger that.
Thank you.
Did she display fear when she had to make these life-and-death decisions?
[llario] No, never.
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.
The heavier the pressure, the calmer she got.
And she... you know, she put up with a lot of shit to become an officer.
Had to work twice as hard as everybody else, be twice as good.
She’d never let the guard down, show any sign of weakness.
But she was tough. She could handle it.
So, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say to you in closing...
..is to go forth,...
..to command wisely,...
..to advise prudently,...
..to protect with vigilance...
..and to judge with care.
And above all,...
..to defend with all your heart, all your soul...
..and all your courage...
..the lives of the men and women under your command,...
..and the United States of America.
Are you now saying you’ll report against her getting the medal?
As I explained to the White House, there should be a further investigation...
..before we move forward.
The discrepancies...
Another matter completely.
Write up a second report.
That's my point, sir! llario's disappeared. Altameyer's missing.
- Who?
- AItameyer, sir. Walden's crew chief.
VA hospital's transferred him out three weeks ago.
Paperwork's missing.
Doesn't he have any family?
Negative.
Fucking VA. We can't wait, Nat.
You cannot imagine the kind of heat I'm getting on this.
Everybody wants it.
Senators, congressmen, one shiny piece of something for people to believe in.
Whole episode.
Walden or AI Bathra?
Both, damn it, both.
Submit your report today.
I'm sorry, sir.
I won't put my name on an incomplete report.
May I remind you who recommended you for this when no-one else touch you?
You saying you chose me because I wouldn't rock the boat?
Dereliction of duty, drunk and disorderly, conduct unbecoming.
At best, a dishonorable discharge.
At worst, AI Bathra gives us plenty of grounds, if we want 'em.
At least somebody has finally said it.
Nat, don't do this. I could give you a direct order to submit your report.
Yes, you could.
Put Hillerman back on the Walden file!
I handed this to you, Nat, as a way back.
You could've had one hell of a career.
And you give Meredith my best.
Tell her I didn't have any choice.
I'm going to finish this report.
On my own, if I have to.
I'm going to get this one right.
You want one?
No, thank you.
Why is it people never want to eat when they got something important to say?
I always want to eat.
Need you to help me find somebody.
You want my help?
Yeah.
Name's AItameyer. Steven AItameyer.
He was the crew chief on the medevac chopper, piloted by Karen Walden.
- One supposed to get a Medal of Honour?
- The very one.
The Army's usually tidy about its people.
Yeah, usually, but not this time.
First he demobbed, then they had him in a VA hospital.
They transferred him.
Now no-one can find him.
Why do you need me?
Can't someone in the Pentagon help?
I'm out of the loop.
Somebody pissed at you?
- I'm out of the loop.
- Somebody important?
- You want to help me or not?
- Hey, who called who here?
Yeah, sure, I’ll help.
Just tell me why I'm doing it.
When you go after stories, you want them to be right, yes?
Yeah.
So do I.
OK.
So, I help you find this AItameyer,...
..and in return...?
There's a tape.
Sweet Jesus. There's always a tape.
- D'you want to hear this?
- Yeah.
Yeah, go on.
There's a tape of all communications between our tanks that night in AI Bathra.
Are they trying to make it disappear?
I don't think so, but they're not advertising its existence, either.
The Army and its image.
Where do I reach you when I find this AItameyer?
The Bethesda Arms.
A motel?
- Bet everything's great in your life.
- Outstanding.
Serling,...
..eat something.
You look awful.
[Karen] # Make me an angel
# Flies from Montgomery
# Make me a poster
# From an old rodeo
# Just give me one thing
# That I can hold on to
# To believe in this living’
# It's just a...
# Hard way to go
# To believe in this living’
# It's just a...
# Hard way
# To go
Hello.
[Gartner] Found Altameyer.
Got any complaints?
Excuse me?
Rashes, fatigue, bleeding gums,...
..muscle and joint pain, loss of weight, loss of appetite,...
..insomnia, reactions to bright sunlight.
You name it, we're seeing it.
I drink too much. Does that count?
Hell, we all drink too much.
Here he is.
AItameyer, you want a shave?
Gentleman here to see you.
You want a shave?
What's wrong with him?
Abdominal cancer.
That's what's killing him.
There's many things wrong with him.
He's never awake very long with all the pain.
I’ll leave you two, then.
Thank you.
How you doing, Steven?
I'm Colonel Serling.
Nat Serling.
I want to talk to you about Captain Karen Walden.
They want to give her the Medal of Honour,...
..and I know that you were there in AI Kufan with her.
Roger?
I was...
..hit.
In the back.
Roger.
But you were still able to get Rady out.
Rady.
Yeah.
Good man Rady.
I was...
..afraid.
I understand, son.
That's OK. Take your time.
She was afraid.
She... she was afraid.
The Captain was afraid?
Not...
..the Captain.
Who then? Was it Rady or llario?
Was llario afraid?
Me.
Did... didn't tell.
You didn't tell what, son?
The major.
Monfriez.
You didn't tell the major Monfriez...
You... you and Monfriez didn't tell the major?
He...
..and then they...
You and Monfriez didn't tell the major.
You and Monfriez what, Steven?
Oh, Jesus.
What? What is it?
Tell me son, please. What is it?
Jesus.
What? What?
The fire.
- What? What fire?
- Oh, Jesus, the fire.
What fire?
The napalm fire?
Jesus.
- You see the napalm fire.
- Jesus.
Tell me about the fire.
You and Monfriez didn't tell the major what about the fire?
- Please, Jesus.
- Steven!
Jesus, please.
Is it napalm fire? Steven?
Please, Jesus.
Jesus, please.
Steven.
Jesus.
Please.
Jesus.
What's he doing?
He's upping his meds. Self-medication.
Well, can you get him to stop?
I mean, I need to talk to him.
Give him a break.
He's feeling no pain now.
Left.
Left.
Left.
Left.
Get off my car, sir.
Think you got something to tell me, Sergeant.
I called around.
You're off this inquiry, so why you here?
Karen Walden sent me.
I just left AItameyer.
What happened out there that was so bad...
..that it would have AItameyer laying up in a hospital praying to die,...
..that's got llario on the run?
That's right, he went AWOL.
What do you think he’ll tell them about you when they catch him?
And they're going to catch him, son.
Now, you can tell them,...
..or you can tell me.
What happened out there?
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened, sir.
It was a war.
Don't lie to me, soldier.
Don't lie to me.
It doesn't matter whether she gets this award or not.
It doesn't matter whether I'm on this inquiry or whether I'm in this Army.
I'm going to find out the truth.
I guarantee you that.
You said you were a good poker player.
Well, look me in the eye.
You think I'm bluffing?
No, thank you.
You want it.
I can smell how much you want it.
It's coming out of your pores.
Tell me about the fire.
I like trains.
Since I was a kid.
Big...
Tough...
Iron.
Used to be iron, anyway.
When I got to boxing pro, I was going to call myself Johnny ''Night
Train'' Monfriez.
- Don't that have a nice ring to it?
- Very nice.
Don't humour me, man.
Say it like you mean it.
Don't humour me, either.
Tell me about the fire.
Where's my other bottle?
You ever kill anyone at close range with a small arm, sir?
It's messy.
No.
We're not talking...
..one of your great big tank guns here.
Oh, that's OK.
I know what you did.
Your own men.
Guys under your command.
How'd it feel?
Bad, right?
Very bad, son.
Very bad.
And you didn't even mean to kill them.
I've been a good soldier.
A good soldier.
Listen to that whistle.
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.
Say it.
Johnny ''Night Train'' Monfriez.
Now get out.
You don't want to do this, son.
Let me help you.
- It's too late.
- It's never too late. Look at me.
Things get fucked up in war.
I don't care what happened to you.
You can't do this.
Wrong!
I can't do anything else.
Yes, you can. You can put the car in reverse. Put the gun down.
We can help each other.
I don't want to lose another good soldier.
I strongly urge you...
..to dismount the vehicle, sir.
Monfriez. Monfriez!
Aah!
[llario] imagine that. imagine not thinking about the consequences. it’s not the doing shit that gets to you, it’s the consequences.
My folks used to have this place out on Calaveras Lake.
I still go there sometimes.
Guess you told me about this place so I'd know where to find you.
It's beautiful.
The MPs at Fort Stewart...
..found your stash in your locker.
Pretty ingenious place to keep it, huh?
Not if you wanted it to be found.
Where'd you hide the needle tracks?
I, uh...
I shoot up between my toes.
Monfriez is dead.
Killed himself.
AItameyer is dying.
Aren't we all?
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!
We're going down! Mayday!
Mayday! Mayday!
Dustoff-3, we're going down!
We're going down!
We're going down!
And the chopper went down?
What happened next?
What happened next isn't important.
It's what happened that night.
Monfriez wanted to make a run for it.
At dawn we're dead.
They’ll have reinforcements.
Escape and evasion, Captain.
Now's the time to do it.
Maybe we'd slip by them in the dark.
I told you,...
..Rady can't be moved.
Right, llario?
That lung - any movement may kill him.
But he may die lying here.
You see?
Rady will never make it. I say we go.
Oh, great.
Great. The Captain's crying.
It's just tension, asshole.
It doesn't mean shit.
Come on, Captain.
I don't want to wait here to die. llario?
- I don't know.
- Come on, it's a majority.
That'd be great if this was a democracy, but it isn't.
We stay with Rady.
I wouldn't risk your life.
I won't risk his.
So if we surrender, the Iraqis would doctor him up.
No surrender.
I hear something moving.
- I say we make for the chopper now.
- And I say I heard enough of that shit.
You don't have to go.
We don't need your permission.
I am in command here!
Well, maybe not any more.
Give me the saw, Monfriez.
I can't stop you from running, but you're not taking our fire power with you.
You're not taking away my weapon.
Yes, I am.
Hey, I can make a white flag, all right?
There's no way you're taking away my weapon, cunt.
Section 28-J,...
..code of military justice.
Mutiny,...
..an offence punishable by death.
Jesus, Monfriez.
Shut up! She's trying to get us killed! llario, who you with?
Come on, llario, shithead, do you want to die?
Please, Captain.
Oh!
Unh.
They're going away.
It was just a probe.
Oh.
Shit.
[Altameyer] Are you all right?
[Walden] Shit!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Shit.
I don't fucking believe it.
Give me your weapon.
Christ, I thought you were firing at me!
You're wounded, ma'am. Let me see.
You're with him.
You got to let me look at it.
Christ, let him look at it!
I gave birth to a nine-pound baby,...
..asshole!
I think I can handle it!
Cap, we got to get you out of here.
We stay with Rady.
- And then?
- And then...
[Altameyer] Incoming!
150 metres and closing!
[Altameyer] 140!
[Altameyer] 130!
Give me my weapon! llario, how's Rady?
- He's dead!
- No, he's alive!
Come on, Captain, give him his weapon!
- This is insane! Give me my weapon!
- Shut up!
90 metres and closing!
I'm sorry.
OK. OK.
OK, we’ll get you out of here, Captain.
It's all over.
No, Monfriez,...
..it's not over.
There will be a reckoning.
Count on it.
Hey, what's that?
There's the rescue!
Let's move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!
No!
Wait.
Help Rady.
We're pinned down here! llario, give me the M-16.
Give me the goddamn M-16!
I’ll cover you.
Go!
I’ll cover you!
Negative, ma'am!
Come back for me with a stretcher and more guns!
- Karen, please!
- Go! It's an order!
Karen, please!
Go! Go!
Wait!
Wait!
Where's Walden?
She's dead!
No!
Monfriez said she would have court-martial led us.
AItameyer was too fucked up to say anything.
She was...
She was probably killed by small arms...
..before the napalm ever hit.
Either way,...
..she never could have survived that stomach wound.
You think that matters?
No.
No.
Hmm.
I couldn't bear to send this.
Uh, I didn't even want to...
I didn't even want to touch it.
Uh...
Can you get it to her parents for me?
Can you...?
Please?
Yeah.
Uh, listen,
I'm going to have to call you back.
You got off the phone for me?
- You’ll want me there for this.
- Meaning?
Remember that stereo you told me not to buy cos who needs a dual cassette deck?
When does anyone ever have a reason to copy a tape?
Nat, just the man I wanted to see.
Uh, do you know Colonel Serling?
This is Tony Gartner of the Washington Post.
He was with the 9th in Vietnam.
Mr. Gartner.
Colonel.
Take a seat, Nat.
He's following up our investigation of AI Bathra,...
..and it seems that he has a few questions that he'd like to ask us.
Let's give him every facility.
- I appreciate that.
- Some ground rules, though.
I insist we be allowed to schedule the release of all information...
..to the public regarding casualties.
Well, I wish I could accommodate you, sir,...
..but, unfortunately, we’ll be going with a story based on a tape that I've acquired...
..of all radio communications that night.
So,...
..I'd like you to listen...
..and then comment for the record.
I can't comment for the record.
This is an ongoing investigation.
[Serling] First right! Turn to the right!
Sabre-6, this is Bobcat-5.
Enemy tangos!
Say again! Enemy tanks in our lines. Over.
[Boylar] Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.
Enemy tangos at phase line delta...
- I don't think any more of this...
- This is what happened, General.
[Serling] Liberty-6, this is Sabre-6.
Enemy tanks on our flank. Out!
Patella, find me a target.
- I think I got one, sir.
- Do you or do you not have a target?
It must be, sir. They’re firing at us.
Loader!
Up, sir!
Fire!
On the way!
- Target! We got that sucker!
- Yeah!
Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.
Repeat, we just lost Boylar.
Roger that, sir. We got him.
- You just lit up a friendly.
- Roger that. We... What?
You just lit up a friendly, goddamn it!
Cougar-6 was one of your own Abrams,
Colonel Serling. Is that correct?
Yes, that's correct.
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening?
Sabre-6, report.
[Serling] Patella, was that one of our tanks?
They fired.
At us or at the T-72s?
I don',t know.
- At us or at the T-72s, Patella?
- I don’t know!
Colonel Serling, report status now.
They have range on us!
All Sabre elements, stop all tanks, turn on your lights.
I say again, stop all tanks and turn on your Lights.
Sabre-6, Nat, what’s happening out there?
Load us up.
Patella, find me a target.
Snap out of it. Find me a target.
Patella, come on!
- Target!
- We're up.
- Lights on or off?
- Off.
- Fire!
- On the way.
- Sir?
- Fire!
Colonel Serling, report status now!
Sabre-6, situation under control, General.
General, Colonel Serling's order to activate Lights,...
..was that a standard response to enemy infiltration of the lines?
At the critical moment,...
..in spite of terrible losses,...
..Colonel Serling didn't hesitate to act.
Ordering those tanks to turn on their Lights...
..saved the lives of God knows how many of our men.
Heroic acts arise...
..out of desperate circumstances.
I have no trouble at all believing that Colonel Serling is a hero.
Like Captain Karen Walden.
Did you know, Mr. Gartner, for the first time a woman is being considered...
..for the Medal of Honour for her performance under fire?
And, um,...
..Colonel Serling...
..is just finishing up the inquiry.
How's that going, Nat?
I think, uh,...
..in order to honour a soldier like Karen Walden,...
..we have to tell the truth, General,...
..about what happened over there.
The whole, hard,...
..cold truth.
And until we do that, uh,...
..we dishonor her...
..and every soldier who died,...
..who gave their life for their country.
My full report, General.
Few of us are given the opportunity,...
..even fewer the courage,...
..to sacrifice ourselves for the lives of our comrades.
In daily life, even as in battle,...
..each one of us is mysteriously and irrevocably bound to our fellow man.
And yet,...
..it is only in death that the power of this bond...
..is finally tested and proven.
And who among us really knows...
..how he might respond when that moment comes?
[Man] I guess we've been expecting you.
Ahem. First of all, let me, um...
Let me just say that, uh,...
..there was nothing that, uh,...
..Tom and I wouldn't do for each other.
Nothing.
He was a good soldier.
He was like a brother to me.
That night, uh, 25 February...
..there were enemy tanks in our lines.
We thought...
I... I thought that, uh,...
..Tom's tank was an enemy tank.
And, uh,...
..I gave the order to fire.
God help me.
I, um...
Yeah, I killed him.
As for the funeral,...
..the lies the Army told...
..and the lies that I told...
..to you, I can only...
..beg for your forgiveness.
As far as the...
As far as that night, um,...
..I guess there's no way that, uh,...
..I can even begin to ask you to forgive me.
I know that,...
..but it's a burden you're going to have to put down sometime.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. President.
[Karen] Dear Mom and Dad,...
..well, this is it - the big push.
Looks like it's gonna really happen.
And I'm afraid,...
..not of being hurt or killed,...
..well, kind of, but not much.
My only regret will be to never see you two again...
..and that I’ll never see Anne Marie grow up.
But I know she's in good hands, the best.
What I'm really afraid of is that
I might let my people down, my crew.
These people depend on me.
They put their lives in my hands.
I just can't fall 'em.
Now, I know if you get this letter...
..it means I'm dead.
I only hope that I've made you proud,...
..that I did my job,...
..and I didn't let down my country,...
..my crew, my fellow soldiers.
I Love you guys.
Never stop telling Anne Marie how much I Love her.
Your daughter, Karen.
You got it? All right.
It is late summer of 1942.
World War II is in its fourth year.
Hitler's troops have occupied almost whole Europe and parts of Northern Africa.
They're in the middle of the second big summer offensive against Russia.
Their objective: the Caspian Sea and the Caucasian oil fields.
The 6th Army of General Paulus is quickly approaching that city near river Wolga, ...
...where the bloodiest battle of the century will take place:
Stalingrad.
Hearts are trump.
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
Onward and upward.
This stuff's lukewarm.
Tastes like piss.
- You're gonna broil in the sun.
- Butter for the fish...
- That's enough, Lupo.
- Have a seat.
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
No, you need spades, not hearts.
Play a spade.
Onward and upward, Rollo.
Can I dry you off?
- And this is mine.
- No, no, no. - Why not?
- Who won the trick?
- I did.
Fritz, when are you going to throw that camel piss away?
It's a going-away present.
For ten marks...
I could get you a bottle.
For ten marks
I'd buy a palm tree... and plant it on your head.
Whatever, you always get the best cards... and I'm horny as hell.
I told you to leave him at the hospital, but no...
Oh, God, sometimes I think... the Tommies smashed your head instead of his.
It's his last day.
Let him play.
His wife's sure in for a surprise.
Lupo!
The doctor said he shouldn't drink anything.
He's gonna have a headache anyway.
Good Italian wine.
- What time is it?
- A little after 1:00.
We can still find a whore.
No, Lieutenant?
Just look at all the women here.
What about your wife's birthday present?
That won't take long.
Battle formation. Hey, comrades, help me with the Lieutenant.
Another formation.
This is getting old.
That's my bottle. Look out!
Be careful.
Good Italian wine...
I can't see.
What kind of shit watch did you buy?
Waterproof to 30 meters.
You still gotta wind it, stupid.
We'll take him like this.
You get the chair.
We'll take him like this.
Who's got my jacket?
Just like moving men...
- My jacket.
- Where's Rollo's jacket?
Be careful!
Men.
The Führer commends you... for your fighting in the African Campaign.
You played a large part in driving the English... back to the Nile.
Crucial to the campaign were the storm troopers.
You were chosen because you're the best.
Never forget that.
New missions await you.
But before you will form the core of a new elite company...
I am awarding you with a medal from the Führer... for your important role... in the heavy and glorious combat at El Alamein.
Men, this is the new leader... for the first platoon, second company.
Lieutenant von Witzland, step forward.
Those to be decorated... step forward!
Battalion, attention!
Right!
Lieutenant von Witzland, decorate your men!
Why were you late, Corporal?
Hospital visit to your predecessor, sir.
Heroes aren't late, Corporal.
Remember that.
Sergeant... do you intend to accept the Führer's award... with your collar open?
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
The award is revoked.
Battalion, at ease!
Dismissed!
Storm troopers, be ready to move out in a half hour.
Battalion dismissed!
Don't leave me, men, don't leave me!
Take me with you.
Let's go. Move along.
Viola!
Good-bye, my love.
What's up, Fritz?
You in love?
When's the wedding?
Dearest Clara...
Russia.
Two thousand kilometers separate us.
The distance is frightening.
I won't hear from you again for quite a while.
You should still write... but it will take your letters a long time to arrive.
Will it be hard for you?
I know if you had your choice,
I'd be sitting... on a leather chair in your father's office... instead of on a bunk in a freight car.
Please forgive me and try to understand my happiness.
The uncertainty of the last few months has vanished.
All of a sudden, my life has meaning, a goal.
Before, everything seemed unimportant... but as I get closer to the front, my melancholy lifts.
All the feelings
I felt unworthy of... especially my feelings for you, burn bright again.
You should see me... sitting surrounded by these stalwart men of ours.
My men.
I love them, because I know that only through hard work... will I earn their respect.
But if you saw them, their smell might make you faint.
Can't you count?
You gave him the ten.
Lupo was delirious, and he played better than you.
Everybody screws up at first.
Don't worry.
He can't handle my strategy, can you, Rollo?
Hey, those are mine!
Not anymore they're not.
Where's this crate headed, anyway?
How about Stalingrad, gentlemen?
Time to teach Ivan a lesson.
We'll take that city in three days. Cheers!
Do you always look that stupid?
If I didn't know better...
I'd swear we passed this same spot ten hours ago.
Russia's big, all right.
After the war, everybody will get what he wants.
I've already ordered 200 acres and 10 women.
Here?
Not if you paid me.
Then stay in your lousy little town.
Look!
They're already working for us.
Dig, men!
Faster!
- How do you say "faster"?
- "Davai."
"Davai" and "Ruki vyerkh" is all you gotta know.
Adolf's gonna build me a freeway.
All the way to Kirkov, or whatever you call it.
This big country's just aching for a fleet of trucks.
That's enough, Reiser.
I find it touching that our Lieutenant... is keeping us company.
Permission to ask a question, sir?
Go ahead.
This your first time to the front?
Everybody starts somewhere, right?
Should be fun.
Make a bet with you, sir.
I survive and you don't.
For what stakes?
From you, two cases of water.
All right.
And how's he supposed to pay if he's dead?
This is pretty.
And we're not even in Stalingrad yet.
You want me to carry you,
Russian pig?
Move it!
Get up, you Russian asshole.
Go, go, go!
What are you waiting for?
Stop it! Leave him alone.
Give him a chance to get up.
Captain...
I must protest about the behavior of your men.
You want to protest?
Tell the Führer.
Lieutenant, over here!
Lieutenant von Witzland.
Storm Troopers Battalion 336,
2nd Company, 1st Platoon.
Welcome to Stalingrad.
All the specialists are finally here.
Let me introduce
Sergeant Pflüger, Battalion 179.
He just returned from Voronezh.
I'm glad you made it,
Lieutenant.
Now let's teach Ivan how to swim in the Volga.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. Captain...
I'd like to report an incident on the loading platform.
I've already heard.
It seems you like the Russians.
Forget it.
See that ammunition and hand grenades are issued.
Then officers' briefing.
Dismissed.
Your uncle, Colonel von Witzland, is a good friend.
He asked me to look out for you.
"God is with us."
These words are on every
German's belt buckle.
No shit. I never noticed.
There is no holier work... than defending
Western Christian values... against Eastern Bolshevism.
And that's what sets you apart from the Bolsheviks... who have no time for God.
You are never alone.
Even when deep in enemy territory.
Müller, go!
Yes, sir.
Müller, go!
Yes, sir.
This is crazy.
They're shooting their own men.
Damn artillery.
Get down!
He's not all there.
Quiet, boys. Follow my lead.
Men, our objective is that factory... at any cost.
We'll start with that machine gun nest on the right.
Whenever the artillery hits, the Russians hide.
See anything, sir?
It's suspicious.
Here, Captain.
We're at Frieda 20. Cease fire.
I repeat, cease fire.
Where are the five assault guns?
We see nothing, as usual.
As ordered, Major.
All clear to target two, Captain.
Fire only on my command and maintain silence.
Understood?
Let's go, men. Follow me!
Shit.
You klutz, Feldmann.
It's not my fault, Emigholz.
Now Ivan knows where we are.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit!
Erwin!
It's no use, boys. He's gone.
Take cover!
He said they're better than ours.
They never jam.
Chin up.
Kill yourself some Russians with it.
Smoke 'em out.
Take cover!
Hit the foxholes!
Watch the gas tanks!
Keep moving, men.
We're getting closer.
Go, guys! Forward!
What's wrong?
You stuck? Move!
That way! Move it!
I can't! I can't go!
Get out of the hole.
Pull yourself together, stupid!
Let him go!
Get his dog tags and go!
If you don't come, I'm leaving.
I can't help you anymore.
Go ahead and die, then.
It's your fault.
Keep moving. Come on!
I told you so, idiot.
Follow me!
We can't make it, Captain.
It's impossible.
Nothing's impossible,
Lieutenant.
Find a smoke grenade.
Smoke grenade!
We got to take out that gun.
Fritz, smoke grenade!
He's right, sir.
We can't make it.
Now you can make up for your mistake.
You want your wife to be proud when you return, don't you?
- Let me go, Captain.
- No, I'll go.
I won't let you down, sir.
I know, Lieutenant.
We'll cover you.
Go!
Or else we'd never make it.
Feldmann owed us.
Come on, men! Let's show them!
Pflüger, go left.
Witzland, go right.
We must take this factory.
Forward, men! Follow me!
Cover us.
Shoot anything that moves.
Let's go, Fritz.
Dieter.
I shot him.
Shoot already! Shoot me!
- Hands up! Faster! Davai!
- Ruki vyerkh! Now!
I shot my friend!
I did that!
I shot him!
- I don't deserve to live!
- So what! Now just shut up!
Don't worry.
I did the same once.
It's normal in close combat.
If he'd been a Russian, you'd be dead.
Mom, I'm sorry to leave you.
Mom, stay here.
What should I do... so we can stay together?
Mother... wait...
Pflüger, return!
Take cover!
Get a gas barrel!
Next goal, the control room.
6:00 p.m. German time.
I need two volunteers.
- We'll go, sir.
- Good.
Come on, push!
One, two... go!
We'll get the Iron Cross for this.
It'll look great on our coffin, Rollo.
Take cover!
Shit. Mother'll die if I get hurt.
Finally, my Iron Cross.
What're you waiting for?
You want to lose another 300 men? Fight!
Forward!
Cover the exits!
Stand still!
Don't move! Ruki vyerkh!
I shit my pants.
I shit in my pants.
You're not the only one.
We have to keep an eye on Ivan.
"Small combat patrols."
What'd you say?
Only 62 of us left.
For your collection.
We started with 400 men.
Tell everyone.
Boost morale.
At least we got Ivan's stove.
Damn stuttering.
After every attack.
Better to stutter... than to die.
Right.
Congratulations, kid.
You're still alive.
Have a smoke.
- I don't drink my courage.
- Asshole.
What are you thinking?
I'm not.
If you start to think, you go crazy.
So I don't.
Have a swig of this.
You've got a switch in your ear.
Turn it... and you stop thinking.
I'm sorry.
Be glad you can still cry.
Go on, have a good cry.
Oils the system.
What's your name?
Müller.
We've got too many of those.
At least 'til the next attack.
You're a little go-getter,
Müller.
GGM
You okay, GG?
What is it?
The Russians tried to get a couple of their wounded, sir.
So I shot.
- They'd do the same.
- Quiet!
Anyone speak Russian?
Me, sir.
Ask if they'd agree to a short truce... to get the wounded.
But that's forbidden, sir.
The Captain would never allow it.
Shut up, Müller... you stupid ass, you idiot!
I was only telling you standard procedure.
Nobody cares about procedure in this city.
Go ahead, Wölk. That's an order.
Our Lieutenant asks... we want to get the wounded.
We have to go first.
I'm not going out there.
Me neither.
- Emigholz.
- Here, sir.
Pass it on: Short cease-fire.
We'll need medics.
Bee one to beehive.
Cease fire. We need medics.
I'll go with you, sir.
You'd better stay.
You'll be okay.
You look like my son.
- How old is your son?
- Three.
Let me go.
It's me. Kolya.
I'll help you.
Don't die.
You bastards!
Cover them!
Hit the windows!
Damn it!
Hand grenade!
- Shoot, Wölk!
- Move clear!
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!
You'll get an Iron Cross for that, sir.
Who opened fire?
Who opened fire?
Quiet, boy.
The Russians started to attack.
I saw it... and I shot.
- You're full of shit!
- He's right, Lieutenant.
I should court-martial you.
Go ahead!
I'll tell about illegal contact with the enemy!
We don't need a court, sir.
Just give him to the Russians.
You'll get in the newspaper.
The obituary column.
Asshole.
Emigholz, you asshole!
Always sleeping.
My shaving kit.
Who's got my shaving kit?
You're still the prettiest.
You should model for the cover of Today's Army.
Grub's here!
False alarm.
They were shooting at the grub.
The mail!
Give it here.
What'd the hashers make today?
Horseshit again.
They must be nuts.
They should eat this crap themselves.
Quit complaining, Rollo.
Yes, I know.
We're the beasts who invaded Russia.
Rollo, I got something for you.
No mail?
She wrote me again that she's had a boy.
That was in her last letter.
But not a word about the cow that's supposed to calve.
Oh, well, she's not the brightest.
She wasn't good in school either.
But the smallest.
He married a dwarf.
So? At least she's sweet.
If I only knew that my cow was okay.
Listen to this. Someone's been stealing our eggs.
They should hang the bastard.
You should talk.
You loot every Russian corpse.
That's different.
They're not at war back home.
Here's a letter for you.
Asshole.
From your wife?
She's at home guarding our furniture.
Schalke beat Hannover 3 to 1.
Alemania lost again.
That's in your letter?
After the war,
I'm gonna play for Bremen.
I've already tried out.
Soccer's bullshit.
I have a rowboat. A two-seater.
My old lady rows while I relax.
By evening, she's tired and quiet.
I have one too.
Hares or rabbits?
I have one too.
Hares or rabbits?
Big.
Your boots... nails bad.
Much cold...
Russian winter.
I can fix them.
Me cobbler. Father cobbler.
Grandfather cobbler.
Quiet! What's "quiet" in Russian?
What for? Let them sing.
Poppy bread.
Hey, Rollo.
Granddad sent me beeswax.
Cure for rheumatism.
That's good.
Something happen at home?
Bomber attack?
You could say that.
While I'm risking my ass... my wife shacks up with a Frenchman.
A POW.
That's illegal.
You sure?
It's probably just a rumor.
She wrote me herself.
Wanted to tell me personally.
We beat the French in six weeks.
Of course, she's scared.
I'll make the Russians pay for this.
But he's French.
I don't give a damn.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Drop it!
His wife left him.
It's better nobody knows.
Kiss my ass!
You all hate me!
Especially you, Lieutenant!
You think I'm a country fool!
Leave me alone!
You're my best man.
Without you, we'd all be dead.
And you'd have won your bet.
Wölk, Pflüger, cover the doors.
Ivan's everywhere.
We've got to go down there, or they'll cut us off.
Reiser!
Here, sir.
No contact, sir!
Get your flamethrowers! Go!
Just us?
Emigholz and I will follow.
Wölk!
Yes, sir.
Stay here. If we're not back in two hours, break through.
Time check.
7:00 a.m. German time.
Why me? I'm a radioman.
Sir, let me come too.
What the hell for?
Let him come, sir.
He might bring us luck.
All right. Emigholz.
The flamethrowers!
Come.
Get up! Come on, get up!
We're everywhere, and if I scream...
You're dead.
You too.
At least say it properly.
Is he dead?
Okay.
You're experts at killing.
Quiet, or I'll shoot you.
Shoot me and you'll die.
You'd never get out of here.
- That's the wrong way.
- Don't try to...
How about a truce?
I help you find your people, and you let me go.
Why should I trust you?
I could have killed you.
With this?
Yes, with this.
Wait! What's in your other boot?
My spoon.
You want that too, Lieutenant?
How do you know German?
I give you my word as an officer.
If you get me out,
I'll let you go.
You go first.
Of course.
Go slow.
Are you okay?
Shit, Reiser.
We've got to keep moving.
Thanks, Reiser.
I won't forget this.
Where's Emigholz?
Help me!
There he is.
My leg!
Quiet! If he doesn't shut up,
I'll kill him myself.
Your leg's fine.
That's good, Müller.
Keep moving!
We've got to get out of here.
Move, men! Keep going!
- Were Germans here?
- They went that way.
Be careful, girl.
Thanks, Uncle.
Work!
Medic!
Work!
Medic!
What's going on?
Who's helping the wounded?
Who knows? The Russians broke through somewhere.
The Romanians, I think.
- Get me out of here!
- Lie down.
- Hold still. I'll get a doctor.
- Where are my boots?
- We need a doctor.
- I don't know...
I need a doctor!
Doctor!
- I'm not a doctor.
- Over here! Move!
Get to work!
Damn it, Reiser!
Put the gun down.
And let him die?
Let them all die?
- Get to work.
- I'm not a doctor.
Not another word! From anyone!
Edgar, the doctor's here.
Help me.
Drop your weapon.
Captain, sir. Let me explain.
- What's to explain?
- We just came from the front.
- We risked our lives...
- Shut up.
For our comrade.
Where are you, Schroeder?
Where's my bag?
I expect a report about this unheard-of incident.
Right away, sir.
He's dead.
This can't be.
All for nothing.
You're under arrest.
Drop your weapons.
What happens now?
I didn't want this.
Captain...
I request to speak with the General.
You think you're special?
But it is your right.
Damned Russian sympathizer.
Take them away.
To sum up the situation, gentlemen... we're in deep shit.
Day before yesterday, the Russians... broke through the north, near Kletskaya.
And now, they've broken through in the south too.
They will try to close the circle around Kalach... sometime today.
If they succeed, we'll be trapped.
Keep smoking, Krüger.
Captain.
You must help me. Some of my men were arrested at the hospital.
One of the men was wounded.
Reiser lost control and threatened a doctor.
Is this a proper report?
Captain, we were trapped.
The entire 6th Army is trapped!
Pull yourself together.
We're deciding the fate of an army... and you're crying about a couple of men.
You can't do this, sir.
The men believed in you, fought for you.
Are we just a flag on your damned map?
- Excuse me, General.
- What's going on?
It's about the incident at the hospital.
I'll have the Lieutenant escorted out.
Some of my people used force to get preferential treatment.
Isn't that the young Witzland?
Nasty business you're mixed up in.
Will we be court-martialed, sir?
This will not go unpunished.
You'll learn.
What's the problem here?
Why isn't the road open?
Look at all his medals.
You like that, Rollo?
Ask him if you can touch one.
Asshole.
It's your fault we're here.
Break it up.
Save your strength for the front.
That's where you're needed.
Everyone in the truck.
- Move it.
- You too.
- But I'm...
- That's an order!
Since it's Christmas,
I'm going... to give every man some bread.
But you have to say pretty please.
Say please, former Lieutenant!
Please.
Merry Christmas.
If I survive...
I'm gonna forgive the old lady.
I had them tell my wife
I was dead.
It's for the best.
Believe me.
But we'll make it home... someday.
So what?
Let me tell you a Christmas story.
Exactly a year ago was the last time I was home.
Christmas leave... because I destroyed three tanks.
My wife and kids... met me at the station.
They were stranger to me than any of you.
She tried to understand.
The kinder she was... the more I hated her.
Finally I ran off and got drunk.
There was nothing else to do.
When I left the next day, my wife wasn't sorry.
Just the children.
I got back just in time for the new Russian offensive.
And I was home again.
Quiet!
Out of the truck! Get out!
This is insane. They'll never make it to the front.
Get out or I'll shoot!
Shoot me! I don't care!
- Leave him alone.
- Go to hell.
Ivan will finish the job.
- What's that?
- Hermann...
- What the hell are you doing?
- This man was shirking his duty.
Out of my sight!
Lieutenant, this is suicide.
I refuse.
Then go home.
Rollo, I've had it! No more!
Quiet, men!
We've had it. No more!
Shoot us all!
I don't care anymore.
Listen up.
The Russians tried to drive us out of Marinovka yesterday.
Knight's Cross.
Despite heavy losses, we held our position.
I'm sure the Russians will try it again.
But without your help, the line won't hold.
Why is this position important?
Marinovka is our best chance to break through... to General Hoth's tank division... which is only kilometers away.
Good. which is only kilometers away.
Good.
You all know...
Good.
You all know... we must break out to survive.
I ask you:
Do you want to starve without fighting... to be responsible for the deaths of 300,000 comrades?
Think it over, men.
Is it worth fighting for?
Some choice.
Wait.
We're going to make it.
Wait.
Wait.
As long as the Captain leads, we'll fight.
But if you fall, all bets are off.
Agreed.
Comrades, we're going to give these prisoners... a chance to redeem themselves.
You'll be honorably reinstated after this battle. On my word.
Witzland, give me your word as a German officer that you agree.
Yes, sir.
Get ammunition... and form two squads.
Wölk, lead the first squad.
Müller, the second. Dismissed.
We don't have a chance.
Why not surrender?
You know what would happen if we did.
Do we deserve better?
I'm not a Nazi, Otto. you're worse, you lousy officers.
You went along... even though you knew who was in charge.
I told you what would happen.
Tanks!
- Who's got the grenades?
- Rollo.
I look like my grandma.
- Rollo, grenades!
- Have fun.
Fire!
Get your ass down!
Fire!
Where's our artillery?
You're the artillery.
Get out!
Go! Move!
- I want out! Let me go!
- Pull yourself together!
Get down!
Rohleder, get back!
Come on!
Shoot the big guy!
They fit.
Damn it.
I just got used to this arm.
You okay, Captain?
The Russians can only hit my right side.
I was lucky.
It's my last... but we'll share it, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Captain.
Back to camp, men.
Now we wait for Hoth's army.
We'll take the cannon with us.
Where are the horses?
We're the horses.
Everybody out! Now!
Shut the door. It's cold.
Get out.
Leave's been cancelled.
We're staying here.
You're crazy!
Everybody out!
How often did the Russians make you shit in your pants?
All right! I'm a coward!
I'm scared!
This whole thing makes me sick!
Where's my pay anyway?
I get 36 Marks a month, and if I don't get it right now... then I'm going home.
- On foot.
- Calm down, Fritz.
The Russian army must be held.
The fun's not over yet.
Move it!
Faster! Get moving!
Quit loafing! Get moving!
Everybody out! Now!
You lazy bums!
In the name of the Führer.
Carry out the order as given.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
We're not finished, Lieutenant.
Follow me with your men.
Gentlemen.
Keep moving! Over there!
Can they do this?
It's to remind us which side we're on.
Listen up!
These civilians... are guilty of sabotage.
They are to be executed.
Positions!
They started the killing yesterday.
There's no sabotage.
They're just out of food.
I can't do this.
If you don't, GG, you'll be up there next.
Nothing we can do.
At least their suffering's over.
I can't.
That boy there.
He worked for us.
And for Ivan too.
Shut up.
What the hell's going on here?
We must hurry.
Others are waiting.
Captain, you can't do this.
I can vouch for that boy.
You again.
Does the boy appeal to you?
Remind you of someone back home?
Child murderer.
Shut up, asshole. Shut up!
You want to be busted again?
Return to your post.
You're an officer. Do something!
- I'll handle this.
- Quiet!
Step forward, Corporal.
I'll kill that bastard.
Let him go!
Let me take his place, sir.
Come to attention when I address you!
Are you refusing to obey a direct order?
Let the boy go, sir.
That's enough!
This is not open for discussion.
If you miss... you'll be up there next.
Back in line...
Corporal.
Do you want to take command?
And you're from an officer's family.
Take aim!
Why doesn't he do something, Fritz?
We didn't kill the boy... so you could let us die out here, Lieutenant.
If you were too afraid to give the right order... then at least give it now.
Let's get out of here.
We'll go to the airport.
Somehow I'll get on a plane, even if I have to wound myself.
Calm down, Fritz.
I'm leaving. I mean it.
Know what you're saying?
Desertion!
Talk to him, Lieutenant.
I no longer feel bound by my oath.
After all that's happened...
I think you have the right to leave.
I'm not going to let you get us in trouble again.
That's enough! Understand?
You're not being reasonable.
You're just scared, Rollo.
Kill me.
You're a sergeant.
It's your duty.
Fritz... stay here!
I pity you, Rohleder.
You fight to the end.
You're already dead.
Who's coming with me?
Say hello to your son for me when you get home.
What about you?
I know it's crazy, but I can't.
I just can't.
A year ago,
I would have been first... but now...
I'll keep him company.
Good luck.
I think you'll lose your bet with the Lieutenant, Rollo.
Shit. Where the hell are we?
No idea.
I'll ask for directions.
Where is Pitomnik?
Bread!
Bread.
Head west... large ravine...
5 verst to the airport.
Thank you.
Come on.
He has a wounded tag.
You can still read the signature.
Doctor Heider.
This is our pass.
We'll get home with this signature.
Everybody look for one of these.
And put on bandages.
We're wounded.
For you, Hans.
Quiet, man. You're not the only one in pain.
Ah, powder burns.
Obviously a self-inflicted wound.
Close combat. In the trenches.
- Take this traitor away.
- No, Doctor, no!
I can't do this.
They'll catch us.
I'm going back.
It's too late for that now.
Just don't screw up.
You either.
At least I'm not the only storm trooper here.
They should take more of us out.
We're needed elsewhere.
Move!
I have witnesses, Doctor!
What's wrong, son? Fever?
I can't read the signature.
Who's your doctor?
Can't you speak?
Doctor Heider.
Excuse him, Doctor.
He's in shock. Tank battle.
His best friend was blown apart.
Here, son.
For the fever.
You'll be home soon.
Keep an eye on him.
Yes, sir, Doctor.
Where's the Lieutenant?
Hans, we're over here!
- Be reasonable.
- The plane has to unload.
Over here!
You pig! Let me through!
Filthy pig.
Here come our heroes. Assholes.
Hans, where are you?
GG, hold on to me.
You bastard. You dirty bastard.
You could have made it.
Comrade...
Shoot me.
No.
Welcome to our grave.
Careful. Not so hard.
Are you hurt?
You know how fragile he is.
It's only rash.
He's covered with boils.
The Captain, he got the worst.
No planes for you?
You old muskrat.
Guess who saved you?
That'll piss him off.
Leave the Captain alone.
My foot.
This damn pain.
I wouldn't do that.
I told you not to do that.
Great. Now puke on him too.
Give me a butt.
Give me a damn butt!
I have no luck with my right side.
It's nice to spend some time dying together.
Play something.
Stupid damn medals.
Stand up!
Stand up, men!
And come to attention.
I want a report!
Where's your unit?
You...
We're not in the middle of nowhere.
We shoot looters in the German Army.
Or have you forgotten?
Stay where you are! Stop!
GG, GG...
GG, he can't do this. you can't do this!
Don't die, GG.
We'll make it home, GG.
We'll make it home.
Lieutenant... arrest that man!
And get me out of here.
You want a report?
The Russian boy was named Kolya.
And his name was Müller... like a lot of others.
You can still make up for this!
You must be very hungry.
I have supplies.
The white house.
By the theater.
We'll drive there.
Germans don't shoot Germans.
I'm an officer.
You can't just leave me here!
I can't believe it.
Bastards.
Stop it. You'll get cramps.
By rank. We'll go by rank.
You're first, Lieutenant.
So, GG. Some for you.
Dead Rollo... cheers.
Dead Otto... dead Fritz... to our grand offensive.
Three's the trick.
Hearts are trump.
Hey, Fritz, hearts are trump!
There's a spot of blood on the
10 of spades. Just so you know.
Damn... right side.
Three play cards... while the other's getting laid.
I'm not pretty enough for you?
I want a woman once more before I die.
You're all that's left.
You could do me one favor.
- Shoot me! But you're afraid!
- Stop it!
You've probably got an innocent girl at home.
Do you love her? Yes? Oh, yes!
A German soldier's love... increases with every step between him and his woman.
But you'll never see her again.
Poor fool! You probably never even slept with her.
Maybe you should have some Slavic meat after all.
There!
As soft and white as your virgin's!
Fuck me and shoot me!
There! Shoot yourself.
I'm tired of killing.
- Get out!
- No!
You bastard!
You dirty bastard!
I couldn't do it either.
I'm the Germans' whore.
A collaborator.
Nonsense.
They forced you.
I should have killed myself.
I thought that too.
Quit slowing down the game.
Spades are trumps.
There's some blood on the 10 of spades.
You know us very well.
I know you through and through.
My mother was German.
I once loved your language.
I'll never forgive myself.
I had the strangest dream.
I had to piss, but I couldn't because I was sleeping.
Damn dream.
Better than pissing, right, Lieutenant?
Have some real food.
Then try again.
I'll teach her to be nice to you.
Don't touch her.
I mean it.
Nobody touch her!
Everybody up!
Rohleder, come here.
Yes, Captain.
- Don't do it, Rollo.
- If he doesn't, I'll shoot you.
Stay there.
You wouldn't hurt your Captain, would you?
Come here.
Yes, sir.
I won't court-martial you.
You were good soldiers... until you chose to survive at any cost.
Shut up.
None.
Don't move, Reiser.
Do you think you can live with yourselves as deserters?
Shut your damn mouth!
Don't kid yourselves.
You should know you'll always be soldiers.
War is your home.
You're already dead!
For two years,
I've prayed to be killed.
The flesh melts from my bones... and seeps through the rocks.
But you know what?
I piece myself together again... every night.
And none of you can kill me.
You used to be an officer!
Quit laughing!
Where's the front?
I demand a report!
That's an order.
Heil Hitler!
Let's get out!
Wait, Captain.
I'll help.
Fresh air!
You're all crazy.
A short rest, Captain.
Then we'll go.
Don't fall asleep.
We'll go soon.
Where's the front?
What's going on?
General...
Sergeant Rohleder, Iron Cross.
Give me your weapon.
Come on, give it to me.
I'm a deserter.
Don't talk nonsense.
Stand up.
- Where's the front?
- Come with me.
Gentlemen.
The front. Where's the front?
We'll go soon.
Don't fall asleep.
I'm not going to die.
You know, Hans, at home... when you die as a soldier... at least they're proud.
That's something, isn't it?
Siberia?
Not me.
I'm cold enough.
I'll get you out.
I'm going with her.
We won't even get a hundred meters.
But what's the difference?
That way.
Let's go. It's dark enough.
We made it.
The best thing about the cold is... you feel nothing.
Everything freezes.
It's too cold to cry.
Get out of here, Fritz.
I mean it. Go!
The best thing about the cold is...
You don't have to worry about sunburn.
Ever been to the desert?
You'd hate it.
It's so hot... you're always... sweating.
You think you're melting, like butter.
The desert is shit.
Except for the stars.
They're so close...
You know?
During the Battle of Stalingrad more than one million people died.
They were either killed in action, froze to death or died of starvation:
Russians, Romanians, Italians,
Hungarians, Germans and Austrians.
Out of the 260,000 soldiers of the 6th Army, 91,000 were captured.
Only 6,000 men survived the captivity and returned home years later.
A long time ago...
...a young woman went off into the world...
...like her brothers and sisters.
She fought in wars...
...had children...
...suffered...
...and loved greatly.
I was the sixth-born child...
...Phung Thi Le Ly...
...and I lived in the most beautiful village on earth.
My earliest memories were working alongside Mother in the fields.
Always working, my mother.
Each grain of rice, a symbol of life, never wasted.
While we worked, she'd teach me all I had to know about life.
Mama, where did I really come from?
Where do babies come from?
From my belly button.
Don't worry. God makes babies and puts them in your belly.
You have plenty of warning.
The fragile rice had to be planted and transplanted several times.
Our rice paddies were always near the cemeteries...
...because we believed the spirits passed through the soil into the rice...
...so the new generation, in eating the rice...
...was sharing in the spirit of their ancestors.
One day, in the summer of 1953...
...the French came.
They destroyed our village.
And the following year, we went hungry.
I will never forger my father's eyes...
...as he watched our house burn to the ground.
But, as it had happened to our village for so many centuries...
...we rebuilt our lives.
Mama, where do babies really come from?
Then, in 1963...
...the peasant countryside changed forever.
When the Viet Cong first arrived that rainy season...
...some of them were remnants from the war against the French.
Many of them were displaced immigrants from the North.
All of them were angry.
My parents taught me Vietnam is...
...a free nation.
That is what this war is about.
The Chinese, the Japanese, the French, have each tried to rule us.
And we have won!
The North and the South are inseparable, like sisters.
But in 1954...
...the French and American allies separated us and kidnapped the South.
Can we stand by and watch the kidnappers...
...taking turns raping and corrupting our sister!
That's what this war's about.
Why should outsiders come in...
...divide the land and tell people to go north and then go south?
Why?
If Vietnam were truly for the Vietnamese people...
...we would be able to choose the kind of government we want.
A nation can't have two governments any more than a family can have two fathers.
-They have bombs, ten men for one of us!
-He's right.
What do we have?
We have rags! We have rifles!
And sticks! We have sticks!
We have no rank, no promotion.
We take no money.
We are your servants.
We respect your homes and shrines.
We are your family.
Do you want to dance?
It was my brother Sau I loved the most.
He was always there to protect me and make me laugh.
Hurry.
Sweet rice, black beans.
You be very careful. Write, Sau.
I will return.
Le Ly, I will return.
Be a big girl.
Always take care of Mama and Papa.
Protect yourself from ghosts.
Take care.
As they went north to Hanoi with the Viet Cong...
...I felt it was the last time
I'd see my older brother, Bon...
...and my younger brother, Sau, for a long, long time.
Maybe forever.
But it was Sau who was ripped from my heart.
You understand that a country is more than a lot of dirt, rivers and forests?
You know your brother, Sau, may not come back?
I told you many times...
...the Chinese ruled our land.
Many died.
Le Loi, Jia Long and the Trung sisters.
And your ancestor Phung Thi Chinh fought to throw out the Chinese.
Your grandfather fought and died against the Japanese...
...just before you were born.
We suffered much.
When the Japanese came...
...your mother and I were taken to Danang...
...to build a runway for the airplanes.
We worked like slaves.
Our reward was a bowl of rice...
...and another day of life.
Freedom is never a gift, Bay Ly.
It must be won and won again.
You know that?
I do.
See this land?
Vietnam is going to be yours now.
If the enemy returns...
...you must be both a daughter and a son now.
From my father, I learned to love God and the people I could not see...
...my ancestors.
But I would learn in time...
...my father's words would be twisted by events.
Government soldiers came to our village with the support of American advisors.
Your village will be safe.
They built barricades against the Viet Cong.
It's part of the new Binh Ky hamlet.
Many of you will be asked to take militia training...
...so you will be prepared...
...to resist the Communist rebels!
You will be rewarded...
...with food and money.
Your older children will be sent to camp...
...for military training.
But younger children can go to school.
Your village will be happy and peaceful.
Do you have any questions?
Go to your leader.
The soldiers ate our food, slept with our women...
...and searched us just as the soldiers of the warlords had centuries before.
But the government leader, whose name was Ngo Dinh Diem, America's ally...
...was a Catholic, like the French...
...and that alone made him suspicious to the Buddhists in our area.
The Northern leader, Ho Chi Minh...
...had been a great patriot against the Japanese and the French.
We heard stories of his compassion and his love for Vietnam.
What are they? Americans?
They say they all have blind blue eyes behind their glasses.
If you take their shoes off, they have soft feet and cry in pain.
Take away their glasses, their boots, they can't fight.
Not very good soldiers.
Not very good fence.
Your president, Ngo Dinh Diem, wants to know...
...what will you do if you see a Viet Cong...
...or hear about someone helping them.
Turn him in to the soldiers.
Good.
And get a big reward for every Viet Cong you help capture.
During the day, we were a government village.
But each night, when the soldiers returned to their base and we played...
...there was never any shortage of Viet Cong fighters.
One night, the Viet Cong came for my teacher.
Have you been teaching these children to betray their country? Traitor!
The first thing you should learn on this night...
...Ky La was saved from the oppressors.
We're the liberators!
The night belonged to the Viet Cong.
Even though I was scared...
...there was no real choice.
They fought for our freedom against the Southern government.
No matter who's asking the questions, either side...
...play stupid, stupid, stupid child.
Any news from Sau or Bon?
They're training in the North.
-Any chance for a visit?
-There's no time for sons and mothers.
I told them we needed her on the farm.
For all the help she is here...
...maybe we should send her with Sau.
That'll teach her the value of work.
Don't say that!
Le Ly must do her work like everyone else.
She thinks she's too good for work.
Too busy flirting with no-good schoolboys.
-No, it's the big boys that bother me.
-Don't talk like that.
-Be quiet!
-Don't hit her!
Do you hear me?
Do you want to send all my children to Hanoi or Saigon?
If I can't have my family around me, what's the point of living?
You always think of only yourself!
The French, the Japanese, now the Americans are all over us!
It's good they go North.
War is coming, you stupid, selfish man!
Stop it!
Go!
Forgive him, Mama.
Don't cry.
I've made your papa lose face.
If you ever do that to a husband...
...I'll have both your cheeks glowing, one from him and one from me.
You hear me?
Who's first?
You talk now or it's bye-bye, Charlie!
You dig, asshole?
All right, it's your ass!
Kiss it good-bye.
You're next.
You talk?
You going to talk?
At my mother's request, a local wizard examined the umbilical cords...
...of my two soldier brothers...
...who hadn't written in over a year.
The older one...
...is strong and healthy.
The younger one...
...is in a place too gray for me to see.
No, that's not true.
I know Sau is alive.
I feel it in my womb.
Did you hear...
...funny noises last night?
Maybe voices...
...last night in the rain?
I did.
Here is your trouble, then.
Your shrine...
...is too small.
And we have a lost soul...
...who needs to come in.
That's all.
Just build a shrine outside...
...and everything will be fine.
The Viet Cong ingrained in us a sense of ''xa'':
Duty to land...
...duty to country.
The ant became our moral model.
We formed cells, associations...
...where no one person accumulated power over others.
Only in battle or by your own hands will you be immortalized.
You never moved up in the ant society, you only moved further in.
If the Viet Cong won the peasants over...
...it was because they lived their lives with us.
But every time we ambushed the government soldiers...
...twice as many came back.
Get your sorry asses down there!
One day...
...they came for me.
Papa! Help me!
Tell me quickly.
Why were you on the road?
Cutting grass for the water buffalo.
I didn't tell my parents.
Liar.
Again.
Why were you on the road?
I didn't mean any harm!
Liar!
You are can bo cai...
...VC cadre girl.
You were warning your friends.
Where's the VC base?
I don't know.
How many battles have you been in?
What's your rank?
Please...
I'm just a girl.
I have not done it.
Do you know what this is?
Think what this can do to your body.
How would your baby like you with no nipples?
Or maybe I could cut some skin off your ass to make some sandals.
Think about it...
...Miss Viet Cong hero.
And when you're called again...
...be prepared to tell me everything you know.
Don't move.
Don't move.
I haven't done anything!
I don't know anything!
My mother used my dowry to bribe a military official to have me released.
And now...
...the villagers were suspicious of my family's ties to the government.
Finally...
...the Viet Cong came for me.
-She did nothing!
-Stay back!
No respect!
You've no respect!
-I'm coming with her!
-No, the prisoner comes alone!
Stay back!
Our men were betrayed.
The informer's here!
How else could the enemy know so much?
This village is filled with traitors!
Government sympathizers that would sell us out for a relative...
...for money, for privilege!
So I ask you:
What should we do with these people?
We must give these people a lesson they will never forget.
See?
See it?
-What is it?
-A grave.
Your grave...
...stupid girl.
What deal did you make to get out of prison?
Did you promise them some of our ears for their belts?
No, my mother bribed an official.
Why won't you believe me?
Little rich girl!
You want to live?
My life is in your hands.
What does that mean?
I mean I won't talk to the enemy.
I've been shamed enough in my village.
If you want, I'll go far away.
I'll never come back.
You talk about this, I'll kill you for real.
No, don't!
No, get off!
Shut up!
I was never to understand why I was raped...
...and not killed.
Or if I had ever really been sentenced by the Viet Cong.
It may have just been a warning to my father.
But it ended forever...
...my relationship to my village.
My sister Hai found us a job in the city.
Papa stayed on the land to guard the spirits of our ancestors.
In Saigon...
...much to our confusion...
...the monks were being arrested.
I've never seen so many cars, so many people.
The other one.
Madam, they're ready.
This way.
Country fresh. Good workers.
So, which village?
Ky La.
Near Danang?
Ly is wonderful with children.
Perfect babysitter.
How old is she?
Eighteen.
Is she strong?
Yes, she's very strong. She started to work in the fields when she was four.
They'll do.
Let's go.
You'll be punished for this, you stupid girl!
Making the Master open the door!
Don't be too hard on her.
It's been a long day.
Run off to bed. I'm fine. Go on.
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't either, Master.
I am not your first.
Yes, you are.
I was raped...
...by the village boys in Ky La.
My poor thing.
Have you bled?
Stupid girl.
You weren't satisfied with a perfect life in a perfect house?
You had to seduce the husband!
Made him stray from his wife.
Look what it brought you.
That's not how it happened!
Anh cares for me. He loves me.
Do you think a stupid girl like you means anything to him?
Now you're going to have his bastard.
Perfect!
You'll have to get rid of it.
We'll go see the herbalist tomorrow.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry, Madam.
I'm expecting a child.
Yes, I know.
We learned it from the herbalist.
Who is the father?
Don't look so surprised.
A boy.
Someone I met in the park.
You don't know him.
Why are you burning incense?
Because...
...I don't want the baby.
I was praying to be forgiven.
In front of my husband's ancestors?
I don't know what else to do.
The boy's Catholic, like you.
I'm a Buddhist.
I see.
Le Ly, I have another explanation.
I believe the father of your baby is my husband.
Oh, no! Anh... I mean the--
Silence!
You know I'm not well.
But I have given my husband sons.
Beautiful boys.
As fine as any woman could've given him.
Don't think...
...you won't pay for what you've done.
You and your daughter must leave the house at once.
Leave?
But why?
Nobody knows but you.
Let people think the father is some soldier.
I know, and that's enough.
Men are like dogs pissing on posts.
They go once, they go twice.
But Bay Ly's no threat to you.
She has nothing for a proper man.
She's just a country girl.
An ignorant, stupid, foolish child.
A maid that will never be a bride.
She's nothing! Worthless!
Absolutely not.
I won't have her in my house.
Not as a nanny.
Not as a housekeeper.
Then as number two wife!
What?
You're crazy.
As concubine to the Master.
As your slave to kick around.
To warm your husband's bed when you have better things to do.
Why waste your health on a man's rutting when you can leave it to a stupid girl?
You're always number one wife.
The law is on your side.
-Please, Mama!
-Stupid, stop!
They must go now. Today, before supper.
You tried to get rid of it?
Yes, of course.
But your seed, Master, is too strong.
Now it has hold of Bay Ly, too.
Please, help us get by the best we can.
At least until the child is born.
I won't throw you into the street.
But I cannot ask my wife to let you live with us.
I'll put you in an apartment.
Not in Saigon.
How far away do you want them?
How far can you drive in a day?
All right.
I will send them back to Danang.
But we have nothing!
With enough money until the baby's born.
I'll send you money monthly.
To a bank or a relative.
I don't want you to know their address.
That's an absolute condition.
You will have enough to live on.
My steward will handle everything.
One day she'll come back!
Don't forget her!
She makes an excellent second wife.
Promise you won't forget her.
But the money never came.
Madame Lien saw to that.
My mother sold snails for a while in Danang...
...but soon gave up and returned to Ky La.
My father, ashamed that I was unmarried and pregnant, refused to see me.
-You want Mary Jane?
-Go away.
Hey, GI, number one cigarette?
How about some boom-boom?
No, me no hooker!
-Give you $10.
-No. Cigarettes?
-No. Cigarettes?
What you hiding there?
Those baby bellies turn me on.
-Come on, give you $50. Come on.
-No! MP! MP!
No, you fuck off!
What's in the box?
Johnny Walker, cigarettes.
-What's this?
-Marijuana, huh?
This is all I have.
That's okay.
Where's Kim?
In work.
Kim work.
I'll wait for her, little sister.
No, baby. Baby.
You go, 'bye.
Beer.
You go, 'bye.
Beer.
I look for Kim.
Me daughter.
Kim here?
She not here.
Please. Me daughter, daughter.
I come long way.
-Go away.
-Please, please.
Me Papa.
-Papa.
-Get him out.
-No see long time.
-Get him out.
Please, please, please!
Go now, you stupid gook asshole!
-What are you doing here?
-Papa's at the house. Paul's back.
Paul's back? So soon?
Paul, good to see you, honey!
This isn't a good time.
Oh, baby!
I'm six weeks in the fucking bush.
I need some pussy bad! Now!
Father came a long way to see me.
Not good time.
He's got time, I don't. Get him out!
Come back.
I need some pussy, now, baby. Now!
He pays my bills. He's my man.
-Will you come on?
-Give me a little time, Papa.
Come back in two hours.
Let's do it.
See you.
I came to see your sister.
She's at work.
Selling near the base.
-Is she doing well? Getting by?
-She's lazy.
-But I help her all I can.
-And the baby?
I don't know why she had to seduce her master's husband.
When she got caught, did she keep quiet? No!
Yes. She has brought shame on us.
An unwed mother.
But she's not the only one who has brought shame to us.
I do the best I can, Papa.
I'll be late for work.
When you see her...
...tell her I came to see her.
I miss her very much.
She shouldn't worry about being punished for her mistake.
Life finds a way to balance itself.
Will you tell her that?
Of course, Papa.
And me?
You too, my little one.
Your boyfriend treated Papa so bad.
You would be ashamed.
You were there.
This is not the way Papa taught us to be.
Do you think I like what I'm doing?
Someone has to make a living around here.
You don't help!
I don't know why I let you stay here!
My boyfriends all complain about you!
Pregnant women are bad luck!
How disrespectful you are! If Papa--
Papa what?
An invader!
Really?
You sleep with the enemy!
You betray your family!
That's enough!
That's enough out of you!
And I'll marry one, too! You'll see!
And I'll get out of this goddamn country!
And as for you, young lady...
...no more charity for you!
Go on! Get out!
Get out!
Do you think that you're the only one Papa loves?
You spoiled...
...spoiled...
To survive, I picked through the American base camp garbage.
And it was there that I first saw...
...the remains of poor prostitutes who'd been murdered by men.
Thank heaven it's a boy.
Put him up to feed quickly.
Too much blood.
How will you care for him?
Better give him away or kill him.
And your shame will be washed away.
You're a very lucky girl among the indig personnel referred to this office.
I will have no problem placing you.
Provided, of course, you play ball.
No big deal.
We'll do it any way you want.
Now, you do your best...
...and I'll do mine.
Open door!
Don't make such a big deal about it.
Just a little suck.
Bitch!
Stop!
You! Call MP now!
This man try to rape me!
Go! Go!
This is supposed to be a joke, right?
It's a joke.
Months went by.
There were more prostitutes, pimps, black marketeers. Everything had a price.
My family was suffering.
My papa had gotten old and sick and could no longer work the land.
Hey, GI, you buy? You buy?
-No, not today.
-GI, you buy? Smokes? You buy?
GI, you buy?
Hi, Big Mike.
You look beaucoup sau.
No good day.
I got something might change your mood.
See those grunts?
They're leaving for the world today.
So what? They want souvenirs?
I got Chinese jade, Big Mike. Mary Jane.
Titi money.
No, they want a real souvenir.
They want boom-boom you.
Beaucoup boom-boom over there.
Plenty of crabs over there, too.
These pencil dicks are clean. They've been in the bush since they got here.
One of them's going home to his wife.
Want them to go boom-boom some scuzbag and bring home the clap?
They're willing to pay $20 each head.
Le Ly good girl. Fuck off.
Okay, five flags. Just for one guy.
$100 for the other.
$200, real money.
Why?
Too much.
You joking.
These guys got the bread from being in the bush.
I told them clean poon is expensive.
Look, Le...
They beat the odds.
They want to leave something behind.
A memory. Something.
Le Ly not that kind of girl.
No deal.
Jesus Christ, you drive a hard bargain.
400 fucking dollars.
This is green.
That's it. That's all they gave me.
You give me $50 commission, you pocket $350.
Support your family for a year, easy.
What's so hard about it?
15 minutes. It ain't even work.
Just lie there and let them do the work.
What they'll do you've already done.
They don't got all day. Take the money...
...and give them a story to bring home.
You're no cherry.
Just do it for fucking world peace.
Come on!
Send the poor bastards home with a smile.
My father was dying.
I returned for the first time to my village.
What are you doing here?
I heard there's trouble.
Where's Papa?
The Americans came one day to look at our family bunker.
They think Viet Cong inside, make Papa go inside first.
No VC!
But he told them no one was inside.
They still throw grenade.
But it did not explode.
Two Americans went in.
No more.
They were very angry at Papa.
They beat him.
Put paper on his back:
''VC.''
Took him to prison.
Bad, bad beating.
Come, Mama.
Come.
You're drinking now.
Stupid wizard came by the other day.
He said to me:
''I have nothing to tell you.''
Just like that. I have no future.
He didn't mean it.
If I stay in the village, I die.
You know wizards, they hate to give people bad news.
You're just imagining things.
There's nothing to worry about.
Who's worried?
What's wrong with living forever with your ancestors?
I'm worried about you, but your mother is not the same.
What happened to her?
The Viet Cong...
...came after Americans, killed so many of them in a fight.
They were angry.
Traitor! Traitor!
Your Uncle Luc told him to stop.
He yelled:
''How can a woman who sends two sons to die for the revolution...
''...betray her country?
''How can you accuse her of treason?''
Tell her to keep her mouth shut.
I never should have left.
I should have stayed to fight them all: the Viet Cong...
...the government.
What am I now, Papa?
Not a warrior woman. Not a Phung.
Just a tramp, begging in the streets.
So ashamed.
Don't be ashamed.
You did the best you could.
Listen to me.
You were born to be a wonderful wife...
...and a mother.
Not a killer.
Don't ask what's right or wrong.
These questions are very dangerous.
Right is only the goodness you carry in your heart.
Love for your ancestors, for your family.
Wrong is all that comes between you and that love.
Go back to your son.
Make him the best son you can.
That is the war you must fight.
That is the victory you must win.
Quick.
Before they see you and talk.
My little peach blossom...
...what will you do without me?
My father died soon after.
He drank acid and died on the ground he loved.
My father taught me life is simple and compassion follows.
He taught me by forgiving me for being unwed and taking my child to his heart.
I bought my father the best funeral he could have. We mourned him 100 days.
A year passed. I worked at the Korean commissary serving drinks for tips.
The war got worse, and the Americans became part of our landscape...
...part of us.
I want you to meet Steve. He's a sergeant.
Look, he wants to meet a nice Vietnamese girl.
Give me the rest of the money.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
Right there.
Yes, I know her.
There she is. She's come back.
Money, money.
Sorry, my friend no take no for answer.
She's scared you take back money.
You chase her.
Not my fault. Sorry.
You want something else?
I told you, I no want to be your girlfriend.
You want girl, you go see hooker.
Don't bother me.
I'm too old for hookers.
I just wanted to meet you.
I don't care about the money.
Your friend introduced us.
That's all I wanted.
Since I've gone to all this trouble...
...you think it'd be all right if I just came in...
...talked to you for a few moments?
Just talk.
Please? Just a moment.
Please?
Okay. One minute.
I leave door open.
You bad guy, one funny move...
...I call MP.
They right there.
I good girl.
Okay. I go to work.
Thank you for coming.
I hope you happy staying in Danang.
-I'll wait for you.
-No.
I go long time. I work in Korean casino.
Serve booze.
Hostess.
That's okay. I have no place to go.
I gave most of my money to your friend and I can't afford a taxi out of here.
I'm tired from our little race.
Okay. You can stay.
But not too long.
When you go...
...lock door, please.
-Maybe we can have dinner later.
-No.
I have dinner. Not possible.
No problem.
Nice meeting you.
Lock door when you go.
I hope you don't mind if I stretched out for a while.
You're still here?
You said I could rest.
And I wanted to take you to dinner to thank you...
...for your hospitality.
You don't understand. I no want go dinner.
Then we'll just go...
...for a walk or a drink.
It doesn't matter to me.
I want you didi.
You nice man...
...but I no want boyfriend.
You have one?
No, no boyfriend.
Me had boyfriend.
But me no want new boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
It sounds like he hurt you.
Pardon?
You want money for taxi?
-I'm perfectly content right here.
-I know.
I know you want to stay here, but this my house.
You want woman, I call siclo.
I'm not interested in prostitutes.
I'm interested in you.
Is this your little brother?
Is this handsome boy your relative?
My son.
Of course he is.
He looks just like you.
Lot of spirit around the eyes.
Steve.
That your name?
I sorry I not very nice to you.
You want some tea?
The fat girl is my sister.
And this is Mom's eight dogs.
She has the eight ugliest dogs in the United States.
I think I better leave you alone.
Too much rain.
No taxi.
You stay until no more rain.
You sure?
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's this?
Just few things for you and your family.
We're going to have
Christmas all over again.
No. Steve, please.
You do not this.
-You cannot!
-Sure, I can.
I'm not very good with words.
Even if I could speak your language,
I don't think I could tell you how I feel.
I want peace and happiness.
I just want to be with you, and help you and your little boy.
And your mom.
Anything wrong with that?
I no want be your girlfriend, Steve.
I no want boyfriend.
Me and men...
...we have bad karma.
You understand?
Bad karma.
How much bad could have happened to a little girl like you?
You no ask. Goodbye.
You nice man. You find better girl.
Now wait a minute. Hold on.
I know all about karma.
My karma has taken me all over this world all my life...
...living out of a duffle bag.
That's why I'm here.
It's time to settle down, quit pretending I'll live forever.
I'm going home...
...to San Diego.
I got a house...
...and family there.
I want you to be there with me.
You'll be safe. You'll be free.
Your little boy will have his freedom...
...and an education.
My first wife taught me a real lesson in my life. I'm serious.
I need a good Oriental woman.
Like you.
If you'll have me...
...I want you to be my wife.
Three years passed.
No, that's Tommy. And we're going to change ''Hung'' to ''Jimmy.''
We moved to the Central Highlands with Steve's new job.
Steve loved our new son Tommy as if his life had started again.
When you come to California...
...to visit my mama, we'll take you to Disneyland...
...in those pajamas.
Mama missed Papa too much...
...and seemed to be living between this world and the next.
Your papa wanted you to stay on the land.
I can't. It's the past.
Who will care for the land?
I'm old.
Maybe Bon will come back.
I know he will.
America, Mama.
In America I can save the children.
The South is dying. Steve says...
...it'll fall faster than anyone thinks.
His mother and sister are near San Diego and he'll leave the Army for a good job.
He loves me.
I love him.
You love him?
He's good, Mama.
He loves the children.
Americans are thu vo thuy vo chung.
They have no beginning and no end.
They don't care about their ancestors.
So they think they are free to do any bad thing they want.
You will not be happy with this man.
Your father's spirit will not rest...
...till his most-loved child sleeps in his house.
-Where are we going?
-Just don't separate!
-What happened?
-They overran the base!
NVA! Get over here!
Don't separate!
Come on!
-Come on! Get everybody!
-Wait! Jimmy!
It's all right!
-Wait! Our things!
-There's no time! Get up there!
Take that, okay? Goodbye.
We've got to go!
Get the fuck out of here!
-This is the end of the line.
-But Saigon!
-You're getting out of here.
-You say you take us Saigon!
No, come on! Go!
You son-of-a-bitch! Fuck you!
Get out of here!
My family was now blown to the four winds.
But on the road out of Qui Nhon
I realized I was not alone.
My whole country was collapsing.
Be calm.
Butler! Butler!
Steven J.?
I'm sorry. He's listed as missing in action.
You'll have to come back tomorrow.
Ticket, American plane, $2,000.
You come with me,
American man give beaucoup greenback.
For dollars. I got 10,000 piastres.
Look! It's Daddy!
It was everything I dreamed of.
America.
Big skies, and giant people crushed me in their arms.
And best of all was my husband,
Steve Butler.
Marine Sergeant Butler.
Here it is. The dream begins.
In his big craggy face was everything...
...I loved about America.
Played football with the guy that lived in that house.
My first girlfriend's house.
She was a real dog.
You make me happy.
You make me very happy.
He's here! They're early!
She's so cute.
Like a little China doll.
I just want to hug you to pieces!
And the kids!
I'll just eat you up!
Hi, honey!
Home port. Lock and load! There's Ma.
-My baby!
-How are you?
You can sure tell which is Steve's.
That's Le Ly.
Hello.
I'm so happy to meet you, honey.
The boys.
Come on in.
Look at this!
Not bad, huh? It's ranch-style.
We'll be here for a little while.
But soon we'll get our own place.
When you'd get back?
Last night, we got a C-130 out of--
-How was the flight?
-Long, you know.
Was it terrible there?
We don't want to talk about that now.
We'll talk about that later.
I've got steak and baked potatoes all planned, sweetie...
...just like you like it.
And chocolate ice cream.
Do you eat that too?
Please, I prepare some tea if you show me kitchen.
No, I'm supposed to do that.
You're the guest.
This way.
You hungry, Ly?
You mind if I call you Ly for short?
For dinner we have...
...steak, potatoes...
...peas.
For dessert: strawberries.
We'll have you back to normal in no time.
The meat'll take more work, but we've got that under control.
Magic.
''Bless us, O Lord, for these gifts which we are about to receive.
''In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.''
Were the bugs bad?
-What about drugs?
-Some guys got involved...
...some guys didn't.
My Steve wouldn't do anything bad.
No way.
Johnny got killed.
Le Ly, you got such pretty hair.
Then we got another R and R in Australia.
You should see those beaches.
-Was the money as good as they say?
...I socked away.
Combat pay, no tax, overseas pay, the best. I'd go for another year, if I could.
I guess it's over, though.
Beverly's been calling.
I'm sure she wants it all, too.
Three more years.
Then I'm in fat city.
How are the kids?
Great. You must call them.
John's having trouble in school.
Jerry--
I'll do it, okay?
Can we just relax here?
I'm sure Lee Lay's really jet-lagged out.
Aren't you, honey?
You drank too much.
You forgot my name.
I'm sorry, Le Ly.
Steve was always slow in school.
Just think of it as a Saigon taxi.
Just a rental.
My personal car's in the shop.
You know I understand about money.
You in Marines a long time...
...but you live with your mother.
The problem is Beverly.
She gets half my paycheck.
Plus child support and she's still pissed.
I'm in debt to the credit union...
...for the loan they made me in '67.
I'm practically bankrupt.
I got three more years,
I'll get out with a good pension.
Then I have a good job waiting for me.
Big bucks.
Just you and me.
We're going to be back in the Far East.
Indonesia.
Singapore.
I'll be making $65,000 a year, guaranteed.
Promised to me.
What's this job?
I can't tell you. Not yet. It's confidential.
But I guarantee it'll work out.
We need to go back to Aisle 3 where that cute guy is.
-He'd make a cute snack.
-Yeah, what buns on him!
Pick one.
Uncle Ben, I think.
Uncle trusted man.
We're not feeding the village.
Bernice doesn't even like this stuff.
This is America, baby.
Store stays open 24 hours.
You don't need money in America.
You just give this piece of paper to the bank and the bank pays.
They don't get it.
I do.
We'll lick them together.
We'll lick them together.
Thank you, Lord, for watching over us all this year...
...and for these things for which we are grateful.
I met her on a Danang street corner.
Her girlfriend tried to rip me off.
I had one like that in Okinawa.
She had thighs as plump as that turkey, cracked coconuts with them.
Wait, it's not what you think.
I chased her like a starving ARVN hunting for a grain of rice.
Horseshit.
Don't run off with your dirty mind.
Don't get a headache.
You and me are peas in a pod.
Oriental women...
...will tell you anything you want to hear.
But if you believe it,
I'll be the first to salute you.
What are you saying?
Oriental women are very loyal.
Have a drink. All I'm trying to say is, more power to you, buddy.
Come on, Ly, it's Thanksgiving.
You can eat.
Think of the starving children in Vietnam.
Leave her alone.
She always eats like a sparrow.
Rice and fish, fish and rice...
...that's all the kids ever get.
They're starving for meat and potatoes.
Give her a break. She can't eat for her whole damn country.
I want her to know we're being generous.
I want her to be grateful.
Grateful. Let me tell you about grateful.
We'd go to villages and the first thing old men and women would say to us was:
''Please, sir, don't kill me.''
In Danang, we'd drive past hospitals...
...past people our bombs had blown to bits.
And they'd wave.
Boys and girls with no arms, no legs...
...waving at us like tourist going to the beach.
Why?
Because they're happy to be alive and glad to see us.
We put them where they were.
And there's 20 of them dead or mutilated for every one of us.
So don't expect Ly to do handstands over your turkey.
She knows exactly what she's got and what she's left behind.
-Well, excuse me, baby brother.
-Steve is right.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Butler.
Goddamn.
It's time the kids slept in their own bed.
They more loving when they stay with us.
Who's going to protect them from evil spirits?
Look, it ain't Vietnam in this bedroom.
It's California.
How can I even see you across all these bodies?
Kids sleep alone.
Makes them more independent.
You Le Ly's hero.
Tonight, you protect Le Ly.
You good man.
Just too much whiskey.
I want to go work. I want make money.
I want get out of here.
I think your family like their dogs better than our boys.
What will you do, anyway?
Work factory. Restaurant.
There's plenty Oriental restaurant growing here.
I'd like to go back to Vietnam.
Make a bundle.
I'll tell you the truth,
I kind of miss it, in a way.
What's this job they want you to do for so much money?
It's just between you and me, okay?
Government has rules about what jobs you can do after what I've done.
What job?
It's arms.
Selling arms.
-I don't understand.
-You know, guns? I sell guns.
You joking?
What do you think I did the last 17 years?
What do you think military advisors do?
I go into countries the US helps and teach them...
...how to use the weapons our corporation sell.
How can you sell guns to governments that blow up women and children?
You know that if we didn't sell these weapons...
...the Communists would.
Guns! Communists!
Is that all Americans think about?
It's the only thing I know how to do.
At least I'll make more money doing it.
Do you ever listen to anything I tell you?
Oh, shit.
-You mean the Buddhist stuff?.
-No, not just that!
I mean, my family, my life.
We don't know anything about each other, Steve.
You lied to me in Vietnam.
No, it wasn't a lie...
...exactly.
It was a white lie. A good lie.
Baby, don't do this.
Please. I love you, darling.
Much against Steve's wishes,
I found a job...
...working in a circuit board factory.
I know the girls well...
...so I borrowed $5,000. I need $10,000...
...to open a little deli in an immigrant neighborhood.
We Vietnamese never trust in bank.
Loan money to each other.
Can I borrow some money?
I think I'll make $1,400 profit a month.
I didn't tell Steve.
He'd be angry.
He didn't like my starting a business...
...of my own.
Those cost me $5,000 in Vietnam.
Take it back to Vietnam.
I'm opening a restaurant. I'll be back.
Steve want to give me money, control me.
But I used to working, having my own money.
But in America, he want me to be housewife.
So I wear two hats.
I'm lucky? What do you mean?
You told me two years!
We had an agreement! Not one!
Two years, not $10,000. $20,000!
I don't think so!
I put in air conditioner!
I clean electric wiring!
I remodel! I put up shelves!
I should pay $10,000 for two years and you know it!
When I tell Steve, we have a big fight, then more fights.
Hung, now Jimmy...
...break my heart when he refused to speak Vietnamese with me...
...as did Tommy and our new son, Alan.
In school, because of the war, they said they were Mexican.
I won't sign it.
Fine. No sign.
I was starting to behave like an American...
...yelling back at my husband, frowns, scowls.
And all the time you spend at the temple!
Steve was drinking more...
...and seemed unhappy with his job at the Marine base.
Buddha don't know shit!
There was another side to Steve now
I had not seen before.
He speak angry words now.
All blood and thunder words.
She's a bitch.
What do you want me to say?
She wants more! No reason.
Money goes like water around here.
I got five kids...
...including your bastard.
The Marine Corps owns my body and my soul. I got nothing of my own!
Then why use $400 on two more guns?
Still bitching about money?
That's the gook in you.
You have no right to call me that!
These guns are valuable. I can sell them for twice what I got in them.
One day they could be the only thing between you and death.
Death? Death from who?
You the only person who waves gun around here...
...who drinks and shoots.
I don't need you to tell me what to do!
They're my sons, too...
...and I'll take them up to the mountain, teach them to hunt and shoot!
They'll learn to survive.
No way, buddy!
You will not teach my sons to shoot!
I see too many guns in my life.
Killing no way to protect anything!
I don't want guns in my house! No more.
You want them, you get out!
Fuck you...
...you lying little bitch!
Don't tell me to go. I read your letter.
What letter?
The one from your dink lover.
I saw it in your purse.
Anh?
You went through my things?
What's he writing you in Vietnamese about?
Does he want you back?
No.
He asked about Jimmy.
I send him pictures...
...answer his questions.
-That's all.
-Bullshit!
Lying bitch!
One time, I think I love you.
But I see now we're too different inside to be soul mates.
No more mistake now.
Not with children so young.
Are you saying you want a divorce?
Is that it?
One thing I learn.
In a marriage there's no such thing as one person happy.
One miserable, both miserable.
That the way life works.
Oh, no, baby.
That is the way life works!
Oh, my God!
I felt my soul would go then, any moment.
God is not cruel...
...just practical.
In this life...
...sometimes, against all knowledge...
...we're paying back for a lot of bad past lives.
I can't.
I can't live without you!
They got me so tied up.
Who's doing this to you?
The Marine Corps.
I'm not going to get the civilian job
I promised you.
I'm up for an Admin Board, and they're going to kick me out.
You don't know the half of it.
You don't.
Tell me.
You must tell me all.
You'll feel better.
I'm a killer.
I killed so many over there.
I got so good at it...
...they assigned me to the projects.
Black Ops.
We killed sometimes three or four a night.
All kinds.
Rice farmers.
Rich fat cats bankrolling the VC.
It was a complete mind fuck.
Psy Ops, knives, rip a man's guts out...
...drop his liver on his chest so he won't get to Buddha heaven.
Leave him lying on the road.
Cut his nuts off...
...stuff them in his mouth, sew up his lips, leave him lying in bed.
Blame the VC. I didn't care.
Drugs, running guns, slavery.
You name it.
One time this guy killed a gook girl I was...
...shacking with.
We weren't supposed to fraternize with any Viet nationalists...
...so they killed her.
Cut her throat from ear to ear.
I was in hell, baby.
I was in pure...
...hell.
And maybe I went dinky dau over there.
Maybe I am nuts. Who the fuck knows?
The more I killed, the more they gave me to kill.
You know what it's like?
It's like being eaten alive...
...by sharks. You must keep hitting, you must keep moving...
...because if you stop...
...the sharks will eat you alive.
One day, they cut me off.
Then one day I found you.
And it all changed, I thought.
But, baby, nothing ever changes.
So fuck me, right?
It's okay.
What's going to happen to me?
I'm scared to death.
I don't know.
I, too, was a soldier in past lives.
I hurt many people.
I lied, I stealed...
...I hate.
Now I pay.
Soldiers try to kill my life.
Long time, I have no man love me.
No respect.
It's my fate.
We're the same, Steve.
We have made bad karma.
And our soul debt will come due, if not in this life...
...then in another.
But we can't give up.
We must try.
Different skin...
...same suffering.
Can you love me?
Can you really love me?
Oh, my baby!
But the fights continued and continued.
Finally I went to see a lawyer.
In my heart,
I thought I did not belong in this country.
I thought of going home again.
He's not supposed to take furniture.
Call your lawyer.
It's okay, Sharon. Let him.
That's what a divorce is about.
That's when you divide everything.
-Not now.
-Please.
Let him go.
Eat up.
-What are you doing here?
-It's Sunday.
-Came to take the kids to Mass.
-I don't think so.
Get the hell out of the way!
Jimmy, come!
-What are you doing?
-I'm going, too.
No, you're not!
You're staying right here and fix lunch!
Le Ly, good to see you.
It's been far too long.
This is Steve.
How's Alan? Tommy?
-Fine. You want to see them again?
-Of course! I'm worried sick!
The police want you.
Fuck them. Do exactly what I tell you.
What do you want?
Write a letter to your bitch lawyer, dropping the charges against me.
Tell her you want the house and our stuff put in my name...
...and you're dropping the divorce.
You listening?
Yes, I'm listening.
Get the letter notarized.
Take it to Father Bob. I'll call him.
Do it or you'll be sorry.
Of course, you'll get the letter.
Just don't hurt them.
They're ours. They have our lives in them.
Just get that letter.
My boys. I birthed them with pain.
I chewed their food for them.
I am shocked.
I am insulted at the insolence of men.
They don't respect women.
I cannot believe such men have known a mother's love.
If I show you a tiny baby killed by a bayonet...
...and say it is his karma...
...we may cry for the baby...
...for his karma and the bad karma of the soldier who killed it.
But we must never use our emotion...
...to deny the wheel of incarnation that caused the act.
It is as natural...
...as the movement of the sun...
...and moon.
Master...
...how can I tell him we must be friends and soul mates...
...without being husband and wife?
He has created much soul debt for himself.
But if you fail to give him the opportunity...
...to redeem himself...
...you will only increase you own soul debt.
The man-hate...
...that blinds you...
...will blind any man you find in a future life.
If you turn Steve away...
...you will be rejecting your own redemption.
Child...
...you have forgiven the man who raped you...
...destroyed your country...
...harmed your family.
This is how it should be.
Your karma is mixed with Steve, to Tommy and Alan.
The future...
...the past...
...are all the same.
If you divorce...
...you will only have to come back and work it out again.
The path to Nirvana is never being safe...
...but tricky and steep.
And if you walk only on sunny days...
...you'll never reach your destination.
Choose well...
...my peach blossom.
A child without a father...
...is like a house without a roof.
Listen carefully.
My sister Kim had come to America and married one of Steve's military friends.
Steve and the two boys are here now.
They're drinking.
He's getting ready to take them to Canada.
The boys are upset.
They don't want to stay with Steve.
Fine, next Tuesday.
-Whatever you want.
-Put Steve on. I must speak to him.
Here.
It's for you. Here.
Let go.
Please, I know you hate me.
But I don't hate you.
Let me help you.
Let me try.
I feel your pain.
You come back home. No police.
Just you, me and the children.
We make this right.
I'll go to your church.
I'll try harder. I'll put the shrine away.
I love you, Steve.
I love the man I saw in Vietnam.
I'll find you again.
He's still there, Steve.
I still love you.
Steve, please.
-You can't go in.
-My children.
-They're all right! Steve--
-What?
He killed himself.
The spirits are here.
Oh, this is marvelous.
Your husband is here.
He is a little shy.
He doesn't want to come into the house.
He's not used to this new world.
He's in much pain.
But he forgive you.
He ask for you...
...to take his soul into the Buddhist temple.
He say:
''Place me in the temple.''
As he finds peace...
...so will your family and your children find peace.
That's it.
Are you sure that was Steve?
He was such a strong Christian.
Trust me.
He change a lot.
And, by the way...
...this house.
Have to leave.
No good.
Your front door faces your back door.
Everything that come into your life the front way, will go out the back.
Men...
...money...
...happiness...
...everything.
Move fast!
It was 13 years after the war that I first returned to Vietnam...
...to the spirit of my father...
...to my sisters and brother, Bon...
...who had survived the war...
...and to my mother, who I had not spoken to in years.
An ocean had come between us.
I feared it would be the last time for my sons to see her.
I had prospered in America. Yes.
I buy and rent houses, became part in a restaurant...
...working all the time, losing touch as a mother.
Affairs with different men, none of whom touched my heart.
Stopping in old Saigon first...
...now Ho Chi Minh City...
...my heart trembled with anticipation as I took Jimmy to see his father...
...who, as a teenage girl,
I'd fallen madly in love with...
...twenty years before.
Had he changed?
Don't start that again.
You look healthy.
You're a ghost.
I don't see you.
I don't know where you are.
How is your sister Kim?
Fine.
Fine.
Your grandsons. My boys.
Jimmy is Hung.
Tommy is Chau.
Alan.
Born in America.
What'd she say?
She says you're giant.
She can't believe your size.
You used to scratch your back...
...on the wooden post in our house.
-Look at her teeth!
-Stop that.
Brother.
Take one.
Be polite.
I'm sorry. I can't.
Don't spoil a good time.
My oldest son and my youngest daughter are back with me.
My two halves on either side.
We share the same mother, I agree.
I love her as a sister...
...but I cannot accept her gifts.
I had this terrible fear you would despise me...
...because I married your enemy and left while you were still fighting.
It's been so many years.
Much is forgiven.
But you don't understand how much suffering Americans caused.
Things are very hard.
We use our own excrement...
...to grow vegetables!
All we had to hold on to was the future...
...because we knew that the future would not arrive unless we won...
...so we kept dying, no matter what...
...just like ants beneath the elephant's feet.
It wasn't because we were brave.
Because we had no choice.
Our freedom was all...
...all that mattered.
When the future finally came...
...there was more war.
The Cambodians, the Chinese.
When I came to look for Mama in 1980....
You have no idea how much your mother suffered.
She was too old to work the paddies.
She had to give the land, our land, to the State after liberation.
When I found Mama and Hai...
...they were starving.
Their clothes were rags, their farm tools stolen...
...the animals slaughtered.
The house was in ruins.
Wild dogs attacked them.
Nobody in the village cared for them.
Just two old ladies scavenging...
...and growing vegetables to stay alive.
Now you come here...
...a rich, strange foreigner.
You'll turn the village against them.
And against us...
...the Phungs, who have suffered so much.
Things were bad for everyone after liberation.
Many times, heaven and earth changed places.
If you ask me, rebuilding a nation after a war...
...is like trying to start a family by getting raped!
If war produces one thing, it's many cemeteries.
And in cemeteries there are no enemies.
All I could think of for so long...
...was how I made your brother, Sau, go to war.
Your father wanted your brother to know some of the joys of married life...
...but I said no, so sure I was doing the right thing.
Can you believe it?
I gave up a grandson to gain a soldier.
And I lost both.
How wrong I was.
It was also An Sau's choice.
He was just being a good son when he obeyed me.
If I could, I'd have stopped you from going to America.
What would've happened to your sons here?
I'm so proud of you, Bay Ly.
You've grown up to see the side of things that's hidden from most people.
Tears are God's way of paying you back...
...for what He's taken.
I have no more tears.
I have cried them out to all directions of the wind.
My color's changing, Ly.
It began last year.
I have seen it before in others.
You have come back, and that's what matters.
You have completed your circle of growth.
Low tide to high tide...
...poor to rich...
...sad to happy...
...beggar to a fine lady.
Your past is now complete...
...and my destiny as your mother is now over.
I'm looking forward to joining your papa.
That night,
I slept in the house my father built.
Afterward, he found no need to visit me in my dreams.
I gave my offerings to all the dead of the village.
I had come home, yes.
But home had changed...
...and I would always be in between...
...south, north...
...east, west...
...peace, war...
...Vietnam, America.
It is my fate to be in between heaven and earth.
When we resist our fate, we suffer.
When we accept it, we are happy.
We have time in abundance, an eternity...
...to repeat our mistakes.
But we need only once correct our mistake...
...and at last hear the song of enlightenment...
...with which we can break the chain of vengeance forever.
In your heart you can hear it now.
It's the song your spirit has been singing since your birth.
If the monks were right and nothing happens without cause...
...then the gift of suffering is to bring us closer to God...
...to teach us to be strong when we are weak...
...to be brave when we are afraid...
...to be wise in the midst of confusion...
...and to let go of that which we can no longer hold.
Lasting victories are won in the heart...
...not on this land or that.

B, I, M...
Cover your right eye.
Enough.
Fit to serve.
- Can I go?
- Sure, there's no use sitting here.
Comrade Major, where will we be stationed?
Wherever your country sends you.
Hands up. Down.
Rotate. Good.
Do a sit-up.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
- Stand still.
- It tickles.
Wake up, guys!
Here is your grenade!
Thanks.
- Commander, I'm back!
- At last.
I've been waiting.
To your health!
Why are they shouting?
Stop.
Non-Russians, halt!
Halt, I said!
We have been ambushed! Action!
Get down!
Hurry up, run!
Damn it!
Alex got hit!
Abdul... you wanted one Russian and got two.
Finish one off.
And if the first croaks?

Hasan, be careful.
They are already half dead!
Dina, bring some water!
Did any of our men make it?
Nobody.
Did you shoot?
Did not get a chance.
What is your name, again?
Private Gilin.
You are a rotten soldier, Private Gilin.
Wow!
You want to puke?
Not really.
Lucky devil.
I got a... concussion.
See what is going on out there.
Hasan, check the prisoners.
Go fuck yourself.
Praise Allah! They are alive.
Bring the shackles.
Bastards!
You'll pay for this.
Dina, bring some water.
They have pigs' blood.
Dirty bastards.
- Comrade Sergeant?
- Keep pouring.
Can you help me now?
No.
Can I ask you something?
Shut up.
Father, are you hungry?
I will fix something.
Sure, we could sit in silence.
What?
When I'm sitting and thinking... don't fucking bug me!
I forgot. What is your name?
Gilin...
Vanya.
Being on a chain with me, Vanya, will be fucking tough on you.
We're the children of the mountains
We have been here for years
The wind
frightens the heart
of any stranger here
Nobody understands us
The mountains will protect us
The wind frightens the heart
of any stranger here
"Dear Mom, this is my first letter.
"We have sea on one side and mountains on the other.
"Everything is okay with me.
"Do not worry.
"Your loving son, lvan."
Such a short letter.
Got a cigarette?
I get it.
If you are waiting for the john... tough luck.
It'll take a while.
Souvenir.
How was it?
Why did he bring these Russians to the village?
I want to talk to him.
You know how he is... always hardheaded.
Hey, old bandits!
What's up?
What did you shoot them with?
- Who?
- Our men.
With every kind of weapon.
Keep those Russians away from the village!
What are they going to do?
Kill us?
I don't think so.
These chains cost money, stupid.
They'll sell us.
Give us some bread, please!
We're starving.
How much did you pay for the soldiers?
Nothing. Osman was sure they would die.
Don't keep the Russians here.
Everybody wants you to kill them.
I had no choice.
My son is in prison in town.
I brought money to buy my son back... but the Commander was afraid to take it.
I'll trade these Russians... for my son... in two days.
Don't let them... pull a fast one on you.
It's better... if you kill them.
If they try to trick me, I'll suck their blood.
Sergeant?
I don't understand.
Who will want to buy us?
You? Nobody will.
The Commander will pay for me, though.
It's my third war with him.
But who needs you?
I can learn how to kill, too.
It's too late.
To tell you the truth, they can't afford it.
Our army is too poor... to pay for both of us.
What about me?
They'll kill you.
Please, wait as long as you can... before telling my mom.
Okay, I'll make a deal.
They'll pay for you, too.
That will be a little bit expensive, though.
By the way... there's a little detail I forgot to mention.
Say good-bye to your balls.
What do you mean?
These guys don't think twice.
They just cut your balls off.
Have you ever fucked someone?
- Sure.
- Why worry then?
You already had a good time.
- Still, it's too bad.
- "Too bad."
I've had enough of you!
"Too bad."
By the way, my name is Sasha Sly.
I get it.
What do you get?
Report your altitude.
200 meters.
Going along the river, everything is quiet.
Get to 500 and proceed to the site.
Roger. Get to 500 and proceed to the site.
How does it look?
Looks normal.
I met a girl in town last week.
We went to her house, had some champagne.
I had my condom on... when she suddenly falls asleep.
I couldn't wake her up, she was out cold.
I ran over to her neighbors.
They said she gets those lethargic spells sometimes.
Then what happened?
I took off the condom... and returned to base.
Did she ever wake up?
How should I know?
They sleep for years sometimes.
Where is the sack?
Put your hands behind your back.
Walk straight ahead.
If you hear any shots... roll over to the rock... and don't move.
Yes, sir.
Stay alert. Still a half hour to go.
I can't believe they'll trade us.
Don't count on it.
They got no choice.
We might even get a vacation.
For what?
We'll say we captured... five guerrilla fighters.
And where are they?
They escaped.
Make it 10, then.
Sounds better.
What if they're really holding two of our men?
They never take prisoners.
- It doesn't look good.
- Why?
Shut up.
Did you kill them?
Where are they?
Those bastards didn't even bring my son!
I'll give you one last chance.
Write your mothers... to come to the Commander... and trade you for my son.
And no tricks!
I won't write.
Write, or I'll cut your throat.
The watch doesn't work again.
What did I tell you?
Get me some matches in town... neighbor!
You had better marry again.
Your daughter needs a woman's care.
- These Russians are dangerous.
- It's none of your business!
You're a fool.
Dead Patima was the fool when she agreed to come into your house!
Who are your parents?
Mom's an actress, and Dad is a general.
Where do they live?
In the north.
That's far away.
And yours?
I have no father. Mother is a teacher.
She will surely come.
How do you spell "deodorant"?
D-E-O-D-O-R-A-N-T.
I want them to send me a package.
Do you need anything?
- No.
- That's all, then.
Stop!
Papers!
- Where are you going?
- To the Commander.
How long does the mail take?
About 10 days.
- Who empties the postbox?
- Him.
I do.
Come with me.
- Make sure they get there.
- Don't worry.
- Hello, Uncle Boris.
- Hello, Uncle Abdul.
What's new? How is your health?
What brought you here?
Do you need your boots repaired?
No, thank you.
- I have a favor to ask.
- Ask.
If a Russian woman asks for me... tell her how to find me.
I know where to find you.
- Have a good day.
- Bye.
I have a good friend. Will you marry him?
Yes or no?
I will marry him.
Do you have a dowry?
This silver necklace and two Russian slaves.
And dust of three roads... and a rat's tail!
- No one wants to marry you?
- No.
It's a present... for you.
Thank you.
It's time to get out of here.
We have to get the chains off, or we'll die.
- Why did you do that?
- Shut up.
That is enough, Hasan.
Let's take a break.
You are not deaf.
What is this "mm-mm"?
Don't you have a tongue?
Did they cut your tongue off?
And your balls, too?
Gilin, would you rather keep your balls or your tongue?
Fucking bandit!
He could have killed us.
Good! Here comes lunch.
- Why did that man shoot at us?
- He wants to kill you.
We are not too popular here.
Two of his sons died in the war.
The third works for the Russian police.
- Who cut out Hasan's tongue?
- Russians.
Of course, Russians.
His wife left him for a geologist.
Hasan went after her... found her and killed her.
He served time in prison in Siberia.
But he couldn't keep his mouth shut.
So they cut his tongue out.
He loves to sing.
Is he your relative?
His wife was my sister.
I hear you loved to sing.
So sing for us, why don't you?
I will sing along.
I've heard the tune before.
But I can't remember the words. Do you?
Why are you sad?
Father said if your mothers are not here within 10 days... he will kill you.
They will come.
You are a good man, Hasan.
Why don't you let us go?
"Dear Mom, I've been captured.
"Don't worry.
"Abdul Murat wants to trade us for his son.
"He treats us well.
"But if you can, come here soon.
"Don't tell anyone about my letter. "
Abdul, you have kept the Russians too long.
I know.
People don't approve of you.
Sasha, my mom will get the letter.
And then what?
Then you will get a screwdriver up your ass.
Would you come back here?
No.
I would come back.
In new camouflage.
You'll have your flame thrower... and I'll have my submachine gun.
We'll enter this courtyard...
Abdul and Hasan will come to meet us... and they will remain forever in that courtyard.
The girl will invite us into the house.
We have never been inside the house.
I don't want to kill them.
You have to, Vanya.
It's war.
She waits on the two Russians.
Keeps bringing them water.
If you say that again, you will be sorry.
What's going on?
Sasha, let me go to the window.
Now what do you want?
You're always in my face!
- I want to look out the window.
- Do whatever you want!
What's so interesting out there?
Why are you such a psycho?
It's my birthday today.
Happy birthday!
Maybe we should try to get out of here.
I'm ready.
Fuck!
- I think that's it.
- I see that.
What do you like, red or white?
- I prefer vodka.
- Right.
I have a great idea.
After the war, we open a bar here.
We will call it "Hasan's Bar."
God, it stinks here.
I joined the army because I was stupid...
Ioved guns, and needed money.
Then I began... to like it.
Everyone told me I should be an actor.
I am very talented.
The Bolshoi Theatre invited me to play Hamlet.
Look what else I found.
We won't get out of here today.
I'm totally fucked up.
I will get you out of here.
Hasan, come here. Let's have a drink.
- It's against their traditions.
- Then why are these bottles here?
Drink, or we will be upset!
I never thought you would do it.
What a surprise!
Can you dance, Hasan?
Watch us while we're still alive!
Vanya, are you a soldier?
At attention!
Draw your swords!
Here, I fixed it.
It really works.
If our country calls us all as one
we will go to war
And we will fight to the last drop of blood
for our homeland
Hit me.
Look me in the eye.
You have to yell louder, Vanya.
My mom probably got the letter... and is on her way.
Maybe so.
When I was 4...
I fell into an abandoned well.
Everybody looked for me, but it was my mom who found me.
She cried all day.
Then she spent the next week... filling up the well with sand.
Can you imagine that?
She's so emotional.
What about yours?
Who knows? She might be.
I am from an orphanage.
Who did you write the letter to?
To the cook.
What a gal!
Died 15 years ago.
Otherwise, she would have come.
She fell and her head split open.
Just like that.
Come on.
You think I'm lying?
Why didn't you tell me before?
I'm telling you now.
Where did you get this bird?
Ivan gave it to me.
Is living with me so hard?
Do you know that I love you?
I love you from the bottom of my heart.
My son is here in prison.
I must see the Commander. Get him.
They are bandits.
You think I didn't try to arrange a trade?
I did.
I took a platoon, a helicopter... but they never showed up.
They didn't want to trade.
They wanted to ambush us.
You think I'll let you and the prisoner... go for a stroll, arm in arm?
They'll dupe you.
You can't trust anyone here, not even children.
Soldiers traded grenades for hash... and kids threw the grenades back at them.
Calm down. Mother!
Try to understand.
We have casualties every day.
How do I get to Soviet Street?
- Hello.
- Hello. Please sit down.
You need your shoes repaired?
No, thank you. I'm looking for Abdul Murat.
I know him.
Come here.
Take her to the teahouse.
Abdul Murat will find you there.
Thank you. Good-bye.
Give me two bottles of vodka.
Soldier... give me the money.
Keep the change.
Where are your prisoners?
Don't you know our laws?
They are mine.
Those are your laws. These are mine.
Give me the prisoners!
Take out the prisoners.
Hasan... take them out.
Move!
You look familiar to me.
Recognize me now?
Move.
I remember.
Give me the rifle.
Why don't you ask me where they are taking us... what they will do with us?
It figures. Probably nothing good.
Keep walking.
There are Russian mines here.
Go find them.
But it's dark.
Go, or I will shoot you.
Abdul... take off the chains or we will blow up!
The keys are at home.
They will blow up.
Who cares? We need to get through.
Quiet.
It's here.
Is that all?
No.
It's only the first one.
Good job!
Take it.
Well, guys...
I was sure you would blow to pieces.
It's your second birthday.
Drink, relax, be my guests.
Nobody touches you. My word.
Kid! You want to wrestle my nephew?
Let me.
You are old. Let's see the young one.
Take off his chains.
What should I do?
Yell louder.
Come here!
Come on.
I give up! Take him away!
- For you.
- Thank you.
They make a beautiful sound.
It's my grandmother's. It's very old.
Wolf faces, horns... apple seeds... poppy buds.
You are very pretty.
Dina.
Go home.
Take care of the house.
I will be back tomorrow.
The Russian's mother wants to meet you.
I told her to wait.
Turn it up.
Wake me up in an hour.
Tell me where we will meet.
I will tell you when everything is ready.
I know your son is a teacher.
I am a teacher, too.
It doesn't matter now.
We are enemies.
I understand.
But can I trust you?
You have no choice.
I could only open one lock.
We'll figure it out later.
Just in case.
I have a son in Chita. He's not well.
I send him money.
The Commander will give you the address.
All right.
Private Gilin, good luck.
Give it to me!
Let's go.
- How are the nuts?
- Fine.
Watching after a herd with one bullet!
It looks so old.
Can it fire?
Better than a new one.
Put it down before anything happens.
I didn't do anything.
Remind me never to run off with you again.
Don't turn around.
Sanya!
Shut up!
Put the rifle on the ground.
Put your hands behind your head.
Who killed the shepherd?
I did.
Take the young one back to Abdul.
I'll take the other one.
Gilin!
Thank you.
Don't come here anymore.
Why not?
Ask the old lady, your neighbor.
Why?
Because it stinks here.
You are like a dog now.
It's not a shame for a dog to smell bad.
Were you cold last night?
Yes.
Luckily, it didn't rain.
It won't rain today.
Lots of fireflies are out tonight.
So, did you get married yet?
No.
I would marry you.
We cannot marry.
I can get married next year.
We marry early here.
Did you like that?
How are you doing?
Pretty shitty.
How about you?
What about me?
I'm dead.
But I like it.
Everything is peaceful now.
Sanya.
How will I make it without you?
You can come with me.
No, thanks.
As you wish.
By the way, I forgot again.
What's your name?
Are you the Russian who fixes clocks?
Or is he the one who is already dead?
I'm the one.
Can you fix my clock?
I won't have the time.
What kind of life is this?
Nobody has time to fix clocks.
Stop.
Papers?
Where are you going?
To see my son. He's a policeman here.
All right.
Hello. I brought the money.
This one.
Over here.
Stay here.
Really good caviar.
Fishermen brought it.
I'll tell you what else is good here.
Lots of fruit.
Yes, we have many different fruits.
But I don't want to live here.
Nobody likes us here.
And after this war... they will like us even less.
Who likes each other in a war?
You call this a war?
Attack, retreat.
Make peace, make war.
No army can take this.
- What do you want?
- I want to see my son, Mamed.
Wait here.
The old man here says he's Mamed's father.
Send him in!
Mamed, take charge of the prisoners.
There's one guy I want to keep aside.
Two of our men have been taken hostage.
The mother of one of them came here and says she's made a deal.
Let her try. Sometimes it works.
How are you, Father?
Get him!
Everybody get down!
Mother, get out of the way!
Stop!
Where are you going?
Get the others into the van!
Shoot, or he'll escape!
I have bad news, Abdul.
Your son is dead.
My brother, Dzarahmat, is dead.
You have one more night to live.
Help me.
I cannot. You have to die.
I don't want to.
Usually they throw the enemy's body to the jackals.
But I will bury yours.
Bring me the key. Nobody's here.
I will dig a wide grave for you.
And you will see... the Angel of Death.
I'll put my necklace in the grave... as your wedding gift.
Maybe your soul will find a bride in heaven.
I don't think so.
Don't cry, Mother.
We'll make them pay, I promise.
Are you glad to see me?
Yes.
Don't kill any more people, promise?
Hurry!
Go! Don't stay here.
I can't.
They'll never forgive you for helping me.
Come here.
Don't kill him.
Why aren't you crying over your brother?
They killed him. Now I'll kill this Russian.
Go home!
Let's go.
Keep walking, and don't look back.
Vanya, what's the matter with you?
Look back!
I'm here!
Stop!
Don't do it!
When it was over,
I spent two weeks in the hospital.
Then I was discharged and sent home.
Mom cried all the way home.
She kept telling the woman next to her...
how lucky she was.
I want to see them in my dreams...
all those people whom I grew to love...
and will never meet again.
But they just won't come to me.

ALL THINGS FAIR
On Mating
Lectures on Sexuality by Carolus Linnæus
The discharge of semen generally begins by the 14th. Year, -
- when men first indulge in the act of love, and it continues thereafter -
- until the age of 50 or 60, when it comes to an end.
And when the semen starts to flow, -
- the hair round the pleasurable members grows, the teats swell, -
- the voice changes, etc.
Both sexes are stirred by Nature -
- towards mating more easily than before, -
- when they scarce noted the difference between each other.
- The time has come.
- Are you really sure?
- Yes.
- Offenders will be prosecuted.
- I don't care.
- Two centimetres. Check.
- Let's see now.
- We don't have the time.
- Postponed until next recess.
- Postponed until next recess!
- What is his name?
- Stig.
He's cute.
- He lives in the same building?
- Yes, the same floor.
Mikael Bengtsson.
- Orvar Bergmark.
- Grunt-Orvar.
- What?
- Grunt-Orvar.
It has to be Runt-Orvar to be funny.
Isisdor Blecker.
How long was it?
How long did he say it was?
- Bengt Dahlström.
- How long is it?
Roger Hansson.
Krister Kristensson.
Bo Larsson. Lars Larsson.
Sune Malmberg.
Sture Mårtensson.
Albert Nilsson.
I was class monitor last term.
Can I be monitor now?
Yes, we can keep order in the class together.
- It will be good.
- Helge Persson.
- Stig Santesson.
- The Stockholmer.
- Are you from Stockholm?
- Yes, I left two years ago.
I am too, I left three days ago.
My name is Viola J-son Gryter.
I'll write it on the blackboard.
Some ladies piss themselves when they come.
What did you say?
They piss when they come.
Why?
It's like, wide open inside.
Wide open, like a door.
Maybe they just forgot to go to the toilet before.
Don't you understand anything?
The dick is still inside.
- Maybe it's when they come a lot.
- Probably.
I hope we'll get along well during this spring term.
- You just staying one term, Miss?
- We'll see. Take out your books.
- Show us now, Izzy.
- Use the tape-measure.
It's stuck in his fly.
We don't have all day.
- A full pass.
- Is it two?
- Yeah, he's right.
- There are 28 times 25 pennies.
- That's right.
- Stop, that's cheating.
- Yes, he's a Jew. It doesn't count.
- Doesn't count?
No, they have more hair than us.
It's cheating.
I didn't cheat. Look. It's hair!
What the hell else could it be?
It's not that, Izzy. You're a Jew.
- Christ, sure I'm a Jew, so what?
- It doesn't count.
You've got thicker hair than we have.
Outside the racetrack tote.
If he was a horse.
- You didn't say anything before.
- No, but that's how it is now.
Wait Izzy.
You get 25 pennies back.
- What fucking 25 pennies?
- His stake.
- He can't compete. He gets it back.
- Why? He knew it from the start.
- What did he know?
- That he's a Jew.
Look in the mirror, his beak takes up the whole mirror.
But this time we'll let him off.
Give him his 25 pennies.
And you should be damn grateful.
"He came like a storm an April night and had a tankard round his neck."
Do you know who this was?
His name begins with C.
- Time's up, 5 minutes.
- She looked, I've got 3 left.
Hell no, one at the most.
He is the storm.
- Are you asleep? It's full of flies.
- His name is Carlsson.
- We'll look at the excerpt once more.
- Left.
Thank you for today.
Sit down. Your name is Stig?
The fact that I haven't shouted at you may persuade you to think -
- that I haven't noticed your little... eccentricities.
Nothing could be more wrong.
Chewing of the same gum is bad.
It promotes infectious diseases.
The note you passed around...
However, I may allow you to continue your little speciality.
I've never considered the fly to be a useful animal.
I don't know how many you've killed, but I am very impressed.
- I think you missed one.
- Two.
One behind the widow's son in the picture, and another...
You will stay and clean up the place of execution.
How? Is water all right, or should I use a little soap too?
Use your imagination.
- And the note...
- What note?
- The note you passed around.
- I don't know where it is.
Right hip-pocket.
Would you please read it?
I'm all ears.
- I can't do that, Miss.
- Are we no longer able to read?
Yes, but I can't do it, Miss.
"How many times does a cock go in and out during normal sex?"
"Prize for the right answer."
You gentlemen have a rather exaggerated idea of male potency.
All answers, except perhaps Olle's, are wishful thinking.
- The flies.
- What?
That one, for instance.
- All bodies removed, Miss.
- That one there.
- Good-bye.
- Good-evening.
Sigge...
Sigge!
- Don't hang your hat on the elk.
- Where is Sigge?
First I heard he had a quick leave, then Kalle came and said, -
- it was postponed indefinitely.
And I made brown beans.
- Was there a letter?
- Under the mermaid.
Little mermaid.
- Save the batteries, Mum.
- An extra news report.
German forces west of Stalingrad
have suffered severe losses...
He lost a kilogram, but he's still too fat for welterweight.
- You going to a party?
- Oh, I just felt...
- I wanted to look nice for Sigge.
- How much too fat?
- Two.
- Kilograms or tonnes?
Tonnes. The limit is 67.
Then he should fight Carlström.
- Is that Strong Arvid?
- Yes. Toughest guy in the army.
In other words...
Every bite is a safety risk!
"Transfer to submarine service has not been confirmed."
- Not confirmed...
- Submarines?
He gets panicky in a lift.
I'm just going up to the attic.
- I'm in sort of a hurry.
- You're going to the cinema.
I'm late.
Chocolate, sweets, cream cakes.
- Let's take the tables.
- No. Leave them for the museum.
- Help me.
- Do you know this one?
Music, music, music...
A technical problem. You can buy chocolate while you wait.
We don't want chocolate.
It's 5 minutes late and then it breaks down.
- And it's not the first time.
- I'll have some chocolate.
- You buying the whole box? Hurry.
- Anyone else...
No. Start the film.
That's the last time I help you.
You have to learn to be on time.
- If Pettersson had shown up...
- It'd be my last coconut ball.
Damn it, I don't want to lose my job just because...
And put your hat on.
If Pettersson sees you with no hat on, you'll see stars.
Good boy.
Then they have orgies.
- Orgies?
- I can't hear, what's that?
When a lot do it together.
- A lot do it together?
- Yes.
- Is that the same as group sex?
- What's group sex?
- Same as you said, what is it...?
- Orgies.
- Orgies.
- Quiet!
- He's good around the house too.
- Yes, he is.
- He always empties the garbage.
- And the rugs?
- What?
- Does he help with the rugs too?
Always.
You sit in the window a lot.
- God, you know what we forgot?
- Radio language lessons.
- Aasen... Norway.
- That's him.
There are a few of us here
round the microphone.
And there are thousands throughout
Scandinavia listening to us.
There are thousands in the whole
of Scandinavia listening to us.
...we here
and you listening to us in Sweden, -
- Denmark, Norway,
Finland and other places.
And you who are here and you
listening to us in Denmark, -
- Sweden, Norway,
Finland and other places...
- What do you think?
- You're improving. You'll do it.
- Sigge.
- Hi.
- How long are you staying?
- Just till tomorrow.
- Did you buy a ticket?
- No, the girl likes the navy.
- She's Danish, right?
- Yes. You on submarines?
I didn't pass the test, but I'll do it again.
I want to get underwater.
Imagine, just a thin steel skin between you and the icy water.
Cheek to cheek with death.
Can you think of anything nicer?
No, it sounds cheeky. As long as you don't have claustrophobia.
- Claustro...
- Phobia.
- Fear of lifts.
- I'm not scared of lifts, am I?
I've never seen you in one.
I take lifts, you take the stairs, -
- and there are no stairs in submarines.
That's her... That's her.
If you stay until after the 9 show, we can walk home together.
- Is Dad home?
- Was my hat hanging on the elk?
- No, well then.
- That's a point.
- Help me.
- When will you learn to undress?
I didn't say you were home.
They'll really be surprised in the morning.
What're you doing? The black-out.
You should know about that.
- When are the finals?
- They never tell you anything...
Not until the last second.
As long as they don't stop me fighting Strong Arvid.
I'd like to get revenge on him.
But maybe he has been moved.
They can't move people to suit the army boxing championship.
Now I really feel like I'm home.
What did you think of Lone?
What did you talk about?
She talked a hell of a lot.
Usually Danish isn't hard.
I didn't understand a word she said.
Some dialect, north Jutland or something.
Sigge...
What if she said she had syphilis?
I'm just looking up a word.
I usually do that... Did it, when Mr. Möllerström was here.
- What's the word?
- Words I don't understand.
We just have a small dictionary at home, there's not much in it.
- I understand. What's the word?
- The word now?
You mean now, Miss?
- Mediocre.
- Moderate ability.
- Now you don't have to look it up.
- Thank you.
- Are there more words?
- No...
I just wanted to see if it says anything else.
Well? What did it say?
Mediocre, Latin mediocris.
Mediocrity, person of moderate ability.
Work of no particular value.
I didn't know the noun was mediocrity.
Obviously, we learn something new every day.
Good-bye.
- When does it have to be back?
- Before 5, he's going fishing.
How is your turtle today?
Thanks for asking.
- What is it Albert?
- I don't know if you can stay.
Don't worry.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- What's he doing?
- Looking up a word.
- What's Sticko doing?
- What the hell are you doing?
Since Albert hasn't returned, I need someone else to go to the map room.
I'll help you.
That was the maths teacher.
- What number was it?
- It wasn't the German measles.
- Good, sit down.
Stig better take that back.
Only he knows where it goes.
Miss, it's the monitor's job.
The nurse was a force majeure.
Yes, indeed.
- Do you see anything?
- No.
Sit down, it's not the first aeroplane to fly over.
- But it's a flying fortress.
- Sit down.
Plexiglas on the way.
- How many are there?
- Five.
You can carve Plexiglas with a knife.
- Any bullet holes?
- Are there some in the tail fin?
- What's wrong? You look sick.
- No, I'm not sick.
Maybe I am after all... Yes.
- Let me feel.
- I'd better go home to bed.
- Christ, that's my bike!
- You'll get it back tomorrow.
- Have I done wrong?
- No, you haven't.
Don't come unannounced.
My husband may be home.
You said he has a car.
What make is it?
American.
It has a deer on the front.
- A Dodge. Colour?
- Blue.
Darker than your eyes.
- He usually parks it in the garage.
- So I just look there.
No, it's not that easy.
Sometimes it's in the street.
There are 4 streets.
Check all 4, for Christ's sake!
A tip. At home he mostly sits in the kitchen listening to music.
If you hear Beethoven, it's strictly verboten.
For safety's sake always use the kitchen stairs.
I never listen to music.
I'm tone deaf.
But certain signals reach me all the same.
- What subject do you study extra?
- English.
I should... We drank juice.
Or rather, I drank juice, and my teacher drank... coffee.
I was just drying the glasses.
Oh, I have to go to work.
- Listen to this.
- What?
- What?
- Aunt Bertha broke her leg.
It serves her right.
Be easy with your extra pupils.
That one was a nervous wreck.
The first in bed lies under.
Come...
Don't be afraid. Come.
Miss, did you see what the Stockholmer did?
No...
When I took down the map...
He pushed me against the wall.
- Then he ran away with the map.
- We'll deal with that later.
Where did I buy it?
I bought it in London.
I just managed to outfit myself.
The last travelling Father did.
He sat in his chair.
The cars just had to wait, while we wheeled across Bond Street.
The Rolls and the Bentleys.
Daddy smiled once, just once.
And then the war came.
Don't talk about Daddy, not about Daddy.
- You're talking about your father.
- I only do that in intimate moments.
And your father. I want to know all about you. What does he do?
He hunts elk. An elk hunter.
A seasonal worker?
- That's just in the autumn.
- We're so poor.
No, he's a private chauffeur, for managing directors and such.
But he did shoot an elk once, but he said he "downed" it.
He drove a few aristocrats to their hunting grounds -
- and then they sat him on a stool and put a gun in his hands.
Not shot, "downed".
It's at home, takes up half the flat.
It's smaller than yours.
We have to duck when we pass it.
Olle! Olle!
- Where is your hat?
- Can't I work without it?
Are you crazy?
It's to keep your hair in place.
- Go in and sell, for God sake!
- But nobody wants any.
Go in.
Chocolate, sweets, cream cakes.
Nobody wants any.
Start the film.
Olle! Olle...
Move, okay? 3 minutes to go.
- Seconds leave the ring.
- Last round...
Third round.
Get up! Sigge, up!
One, two, three...
Eight, nine, ten. Out!
Sigge! Sigge!
Stop. I'm first...
Anyway, elders come first.
Will we make it?
We'll begin with the air raid alarm,
which sounds like this.
Are you sure that's the Stockholm accent?
Viola.
Viola, happy birthday.
I didn't go to Nässjö.
Viola!
Well, hello, where's the wife?
- Has she gone on an errand?
- Yes.
- Are you behind in English again?
- Yes.
A vase. Just perfect.
Tchaikovsky. Romeo and Juliet.
- The girl on the balcony.
- Yeah, I know.
Straight gin.
Not bad.
But you should see the plans
I drew for my real innovations.
This is just small potatoes.
A bit of hocus-pocus for customers.
But not without a certain elevating effect on turnover.
There's a lot...
You think of a lot of things, -
- when you sit behind the wheel.
And you know, the roads around Göinge, straight and boring.
You have lots of time.
Lots of time to think there among those spruce trees.
It's not complicated.
You just regulate the flow with a little bolt on the back.
If you're away, or made some unwise New Year's resolutions, -
- you can stop the flow and turn it on again January 2.
Understand? As easy as pie.
You know, this is just peanuts.
A little gimmick for customers, but it makes an impression.
And that's what counts in my business, making an impression.
Take my name.
It's not Kjell as on my sign.
Kjell is no good, boring.
Christ! No, no...
It's only by the pastor and my sign that I'm named Kjell.
My real name... Frank.
Frank to my customers.
They think of Frank Sinatra, and I'm half-way in.
Everybody likes Sinatra, right?
I prefer Mahler myself.
And Beethoven, late Beethoven.
String quartets. Grosse fuge.
Cream for the cat.
Skol, to Beethoven.
- Frank... and your name is?
- Stig.
SLEEP ON.
KJELL IS AT KOLMÅRDEN. V.
Good-morning, Albert.
Is anyone absent today besides Stig?
Is Stig absent?
Yes, I met his mother on the tram.
Hi. We must hurry.
Breakfast break will soon be over.
- Are you finished?
- Yes.
It's coming soon.
It swells, swells...
- Do you want some juice?
- Yes please.
Think of what we talked about.
Stockings made of nylon.
- Nylon stockings.
- Thanks.
That's what Yank parachutes are made of.
It's like sandpaper round the thighs.
Women aren't so dumb.
Think about it.
Where do wool stockings come from?
The ones that warm ladies' legs?
It comes from curly little lambs.
- And shoes, where are they from?
- From cows.
Yes. Mooo, that's it.
Cows. Milk under their bellies and leather on their backs.
And let's not forget the hard-working little silkworm.
The slant-eyed workhorse from China.
A silent character, certainly, -
- but it works and struggles by the sweat of its brow.
Not to mention cotton, which grows in the fields of Alabama.
What do these materials have in common?
Well, they come from...
From abroad.
But we have lambs and cows in Sweden. For God's sake, Stig.
- No they come from...?
- From nature?
- Of course.
- They move.
Move, make noises... well, not all of them.
- Run and play when young.
- Silkworms don't run...
- They lie in cocoons when young.
- Sure.
But the rest. Wool, leather...
They run around and dance and play.
Moo, baa...
And where does nylon come from?
Oily machines in the Pentagon.
On top of all that, it's a dumb product. Nylon has no voice.
It's not just unnatural, it's an abomination.
It's misbegotten, it's worse than that, worse.
It's, it's...
- An anomaly.
- Exactly. Exactly. It's...
- It's an...
- Anomaly.
That's it... Skol to wool!
- What's on at the cinema tonight?
- "They Died With Their Boots On".
- Skol!
- To wool.
Dad's home. Your hat.
- You bought a gramophone record?
- Wait. Listen.
Was it expensive?
Stig bought a gramophone record.
It's Sigge's gramophone.
He can't use it.
But Sigge's at sea, Seymor.
I'll listen later.
Let the cat out!
Let the cat out!
Can't you hear me?
Jesus Christ!
- You old bastard!
- What did you call me?
- You old bastard!
- Stop it, boys!
What does the stocking say?
You don't have to explain, if you don't insist on it.
Sit down.
Sit down!
Swedish? Or English?
You must speak it perfectly by now.
Explanation, the young man asks.
But can the husband keep calm?
There are certain things -
- that shouldn't be in a certain place at a certain time.
A lady's garter, for example.
On top of everything violet.
Where should it not be, -
- when the old salesman comes home after a week on the road?
In the back seat of his car.
If it happens to lie there, who should definitely not find it?
His wife, of course.
Wrong thing, wrong place, wrong finder, wrong time.
Well, he sells ladies underwear.
Couldn't the garter have come from his sample collection?
No.
No, it couldn't.
It was in fact used.
What an idiot!
That garter cost me a son.
Nothing could repair that.
One week after the wedding.
And then, violet, the colour of sin.
Of course, booze was to blame.
You don't know what you do, what you did, what you should do.
It simply just tastes too good.
Sticko. How are you? I'm fine.
There's a new match next Thursday. Sigge.
It's true...
It's the same language.
I can't fit it together.
I can't fit it together.
I can't fit it together.
I can't fit it together!
The rule for going on the wagon.
Avoid hotel dining rooms.
You have to sleep in a hotel, but skip dining rooms.
Imagine, Lilly's Farewell played by some dusty dining-room trio, -
- when you're sitting there hungering for Mahler.
Then it's tempting to order two whites and a brown.
And wash down the misery.
And they have dandruff on their collars, all three of them.
There they are.
Emil, Emil!
Once more.
Shoot now, Emil.
Now we'll drink a toast.
- Skol.
- Skol, and welcome.
- Stina, more presents.
- There's no name on this one.
Have I got an unknown admirer here?
You'd better watch out, Seymor.
- What will you use that for?
- I don't understand.
- What's so funny about the duck?
- A family secret.
- Curt, play another piece.
- Yes, do that.
- I want to show you something.
- What?
- What do you want to show me?
- You'll see.
Stand there.
Don't look before I tell you to.
Now you can look.
Do what you want with me.
Don't be shy.
This is what a woman looks like.
I've thought of everything.
I locked the door.
The others won't come for a while.
You saw how many cakes were left.
You don't have to worry about me getting pregnant.
It tells on the package how to use them.
I've thought of everything.
If there's a lot of blood...
If I could explain...
- If I could explain, Lisbeth...
- You don't have to explain. Just go.
If your mum asks about me, say I ate too much cake.
- Listen, I found that quotation.
- I want to hear this now.
- Just turn it down a bit.
- No, I want it like that.
Why are you with Frank?
Why did you get married?
He is my hostage.
Frank is a hostage I took once.
You should have seen all the gentlemen who courted me.
They would always think before opening their mouths, -
- so they never spoke.
These were courting "cavaliers".
Well-tailored, with nothing inside.
I called them courting canailleries, scoundrels.
Scoundrels who were just after my father's money.
And when Frank came, you should have seen my aunts' faces.
He brought fresh air into the salons, they couldn't stand that.
But I got air and could begin to breathe.
But that air is used up now.
Shouldn't you let your hostage go?
Why don't you divorce?
He must have someone to come home to.
You've seen it for yourself, otherwise he'll sink down.
Are you sure of that?
I know where to buy cheap condoms.
If you buy five hundred, you get them for half price.
What do you want 500 condoms for?
You have no use for one.
Advance planning.
Like, if you fuck three times a day, -
- then you will use them in less than six months.
Only rabbits fuck three times a day.
And they don't need condoms.
Nobody is forcing you to buy.
- You said you're off booze.
- I know, but there are reasons.
You come to a house of mourning.
There should be spruce twigs.
The gramophone plays suitable music. Kindertottenlieder.
NYLON HYSTERIA IN AMERICA
- Toten.
- What?
It's toten. They're not hottentots.
No, I can't speak German.
But I hear that it's sad music.
- Children's death. Kindertoten.
- Yes, yes...
Toten or totten, they die in any case.
- "Nylon hysteria in America."
- It will soon be here.
- It's just a matter of time.
- Maybe it's a fad.
- It'll pass.
- No, no.
Once women wrap their thighs in sandpaper, you can't stop them.
It's sad that they don't know better, but I mean if...
You mean I should give in and begin selling sandpaper?
Never... Never!
Christ, it's not primarily about money.
It's really, it's...
- An anomaly.
- Exactly.
But...
Even if...
Even if what?
- It's too late anyway.
- Why is it too late?
Go down in the cellar and you'll see.
You mean you've...
Remember that batch of wool pants?
Yes, on Lundavägen.
Suspiciously cheap. You bought it?
I couldn't resist at the price.
- Was it a big batch?
- Barely room in the cellar.
- So you rented Anderbjörks' cellar.
- Christ no, it was full!
Whose cellar, Frank?
I'm thinking about the price.
You couldn't rent...?
Yes, the Goat's.
Not the Goat's...
Yes, the Goat.
But that's not all.
No? Another bargain-price batch?
- Yes, but not wool.
- No. Not wool.
Could it be silk? No.
What the hell! Why not silk?
Was it silk?
- Feinberger...
- And the Goat's cellar was full?
- You could hardly close the door.
- So you had to rent another place?
- Yes, so what?
- Where? That crook Karl Ohlsson?
Yes, more expensive than the Goat's.
It was packed full of crap.
I had to empty it.
It was a hell of a job.
I would like to see their bedroom.
The old lady had jam everywhere.
Every day, for weeks...
- I've already written it, Miss.
- Do as I say.
THE COAST IS CLEAR. 7.30 P.M.
- May I go to the toilet, Miss?
- Of course.
GIRLS
- That's all for today.
- Thank you.
- The turtle didn't hurt you?
- You promised...
I wasn't talking about Stig.
I said the turtle.
You learned something anyway.
- You talk like them up there.
- What good is that to me?
You can talk to the turtle in the Stockholm dialect.
COME TO THE BOX. STIG.
Weren't you going to the john?
It's vacant now.
- But I've been already.
- I mean, for safety's sake.
Yes, you're right.
Welcome aboard.
Where did she go?
Strange... Without clothes.
Damn. It's moving.
We'll just go along.
- Where did you learn all that?
- At work.
I sell chocolate in the cinema:
Film kisses and stuff...
I'm so happy.
I shall give some of the names
so you will understand the effort-
- that has gone
into finding the men of The Wolf...
- Hot?
- God yes.
The whole factory wanted open windows except that bitch Holm.
She can't stand fresh air.
They were closed all day.
We'll have milk for dinner.
I traded coupons with Svea.
Rydbergs are famous for, five letters?
Santa... Santa Claus.
You knew it.
You should drink milk.
That's where the calcium is.
- Predator, 4 letters, with an L in it?
- Wolf.
- You knew that too.
- No, I didn't think of it.
We gave you milk when you were small.
That's why you and Sigge have straight backs.
All the kids who didn't get milk have crooked backs.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
That's why he's such a good boxer.
The Central Dairy did it.
I'll go and unpack now.
The crown
has taken over the ship now.
This is an important role.
It was equipped with echolocation.
Wolf's jaws... The Wolf.
- What's wrong with you?
- It's nothing.
You look like you're going to faint.
Puberty.
Sven Jerring's report
from the salvage ship Belos.
- No.
- Any adults at home?
No, just me.
I'll stay until you've read it.
The submarine Wolf just finished trials at sea outside...
Everything all right?
I'll close the door.
Now a report from the west coast
on the rescue work.
Belos here.
We have no information...
I'll do that.
- Are you going to help?
- I usually do.
Something has occurred
that will be reported on radio...
How long have you known?
Why didn't you say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Sit down. I didn't know anything before we did the crossword.
- Predator in 4 letters.
- An L in the middle.
I knew then. I got Sigge's letter.
He and I had a code.
From the kids' pages.
A line from dot to dot gives a picture.
Remember the giraffes?
It was always giraffes.
But this time it was a wolf's jaws.
Then I knew he'd got his wish, to serve on that damn submarine.
- I knew nothing before that.
- Why weren't we informed?
We were. A telegram.
I hid it behind the books.
I couldn't... I'm sorry, Mum.
I intended to tell you a number of times, but I just couldn't.
I thought, if there's no danger,
I didn't want to worry you.
And there is no danger, Mum.
They've sent out all the ships.
- All the ships are searching.
- They're all searching now.
One... The back row.
That will be 1.50.
Lieutenant von Döbeln in person, -
- ready to hit
the French at Hamburg.
It's 30 years ago
since my first battle.
And now I must beg to get
a little whiff of gunpowder.
Well, there'll be no rattling...
I'll see if I can find him.
From headquarters
to General von Döbeln.
- Please seal this.
- Yes, General.
Sorry General but my betrothed...
- At least let me try to explain.
- Awful! I won't talk about it.
I never want to see you again.
I wish you'd move away.
Or that we would, so I don't happen to meet such a disgusting person.
It's open!
- We have to talk.
- Look who's here.
Look who's here, a rare guest.
Give me the glass, you might cut yourself.
So you don't want to screw the little schoolteacher today?
No biology lesson with practical application?
It doesn't suit you now, right?
Not in the hooky-playing mood?
I'll show you, by Christ!
Unbutton me!
Didn't you hear what I said?
Unbutton me.
Undress me, undress me!
Undress me, then take that off!
Take it off...
Didn't you hear what I said?
Take it off!
That's it. My brassiere too.
No cheating, you know exactly how to do it.
Unbutton it there.
That's it, open the clasp.
Let go!
There. What do we find here?
No messing with the food.
The entrée first.
You haven't forgotten your table manners, have you?
I need some advice.
I'm listening.
It's about a pupil
I've had problems with for some time.
Stig, please stay behind.
- It's over, after that bottle.
- I don't know what you mean.
I asked you to stay because I feel I have to flunk you.
- You won't be in my class...
- Flunk? What the hell is this?
You will not be in my class next year.
The official explanation will be repeated absence from class, -
- without a parental note.
Also, fail tests in my subject, which is personally offensive.
You know the unofficial explanation...
I can't stand to have you in my classroom any more.
It happens to be a place of education, not a rabbit farm.
Stop!
Why are you lying? You know why I wasn't present at your lessons.
I was in your bed waiting for you to come home for a fuck.
- Don't talk like that.
- What?
Do you think it was something special? It was just ordinary fucks.
Silence!
- Are you afraid I'll tell?
- Who'd believe you?
Please leave the classroom.
Albert...
Stig.
This was a hard decision, -
- what with your family situation.
Nonetheless, we are all in agreement -
- that you shall repeat Class 3 next year.
We don't see this as punishment.
We see it as a favour.
We want to be certain that when you leave your old school -
- you will take with you in life everything it has to give you.
We want you to leave the nest, fully fledged.
And then she cut out my marks...
How much have you had to drink?
How much did you drink?
- I can take the helmet off.
- No, keep it on, sit down.
- It just tastes too good.
- You know she's lying.
You know why I didn't have a note when I was absent.
Don't you? I need your help now!
- Can I offer you something?
- You can offer me the truth.
You know she's lying.
She lies like hell.
Talk to her, Frank, or Kjell, or whatever the hell you're called.
You don't...
It doesn't have to be official, -
- but you must talk to her.
Can't you do something?
But you'll do anything to creep to that pussy once a year, right?
There's nothing left. She's torn wide open between her legs.
"Storks saw us here in Skåne..."
Sit down.
Stig.
It's something about his brother.
They found The Wolf.
- A flying fortress.
- Do you see it, Nisse?
- Two engines out.
- It's coming right here.
What's wrong? It's coming here!
Petrol.
- It's burning.
- Was that the monitor in 3B?
Anything broken?
They are pumping the dry-dock
out rapidly.
Soon the mystery will be revealed.
A mine has blown a gaping hole
in the hull.
The explosion was so powerful
the hull almost broke in two.
Fractures are visible.
It's a miracle it didn't break
in the middle during salvage.
The Wolf went straight
to the bottom.
It hit a rock there
and the bows caved in completely.
It must have been terrible.
This is the last time a Swedish
navy ship will be named "Wolf".
Recovery of the bodies of the 33
crew members began immediately.
A crane lowered them one after
the other onto navel houseboats.
All the crew members
were immediately identified.
I've rewound the film, -
- and I've run that news reel at least 20 times for you.
Now I'll go up and shut it off.
Then we'll go home.
It's best that way.
It must be twig...
We would have written notes for you if you just asked us.
If you were so tired of all that night work.
It's just a matter of time before the god RA comes up.
- Night work?
- Yes.
Sometimes you didn't get home til after we'd gone to bed.
I never saw a sick note, or whatever they're called.
Note of absence.
I can't forgive myself.
Some mornings you looked exhausted.
I shouldn't have let you go to the cinema night after night.
What is it, Stig?
- What is what?
- There's something else.
It's not only Sigge and failing in school.
Surely you can tell me,
I'm your mother.
Another time, when you're older and wiser.
Where's Dad?
Urban Sahlin.
Stig Santesson.
Stig Santesson.
Not present.
Karl-Erik Schön.
Karl-Erik Schön.
FEAR OF THE LORD
IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM
Wouldn't be on the first floor, would it?
Ambulance!
Yeah. Yeah, here you are, love.
In 'ere.
It's the old fella.
He's collapsed on the couch.
Let's have a look at him, eh?
This is his grand-daughter.
You were here when this happened, were you?
Yeah, I just come in and found him on the couch.
What's his name?
Dave Carr.
Dave!
Dave!
Is he gonna be all right?
Dave? Dave?
No response there, Dave.
No response, yeah...
How's he doing, love?
He's okay at the moment so let's just keep our fingers crosse.
Does he have any other close relatives at all?
There's my mum. She lives in wales, so, I mean, she doesn't see him often
Her and me dad have split up.
Paul, make the hospital.
He's just gone on us, mate.
Oh, God! Have we lost him?
Oh, God, Dot!
It's all right...
(THE MINER
MORE PIT CLOSURES)
(The Socialist
LABOURS' FIFTH COLUMN)
(ALL INTO ACTION NOW!
DEFEND SPANISH REPUBLIC!)
In February a coalition of socialist, republican and other left wing parties were victorious in the general election.
They proposed a series of democratic reforms.
The big landowners, industrialists, churchmen and army officers feared the growing power of the working class.
July 18th.
There was a military uprising led by the Fascist General Franco against the democratically elected government.
Government supporters formed militias to defend themselves.
Organised by trades unions and political parties, they went to fight for their democratic rights against the Fascists.
This, this is... this is the... one of the militias going to the Zaragosa front in, in Aragon.
You can see all the cars.
They've got the name of the workers' organisation... because they've all been nationalised, they've all been taken over by the workers.
That is the Union of, of the Railway workers.
This is the CNT... the anarchists' union.
As you can see... the support the whole of Barcelona is on the streets but with very few guns.
Most people haven't got guns.
You can see young, old, men, women.
These are the fascists.
The General, the defenders of privilege.
And this is what they are doing to us.
They are killed and left there... just for being trade unionists.
Every defeat for us is a defeat for you.
Every step that takes Franco closer to poser in Spain also takes the fascists closer to power here.
If Franco wins the war... it would be a major boost for fascists everywhere.
And before long, comrades... they will drag all freedom-loving people down to barbarism and, and war.
Comrades, whether Spanish or English, or American or Chinese we are one class of people with the same aspiration... the same hope for a just and equal society.
I want you to join with us... make our fight your fight.
Let's come together... let's come together...
Let's take up the slogan.
No Pasaran.
They shall not pass.
No Pasaran. No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
No Pasaran.
You've got our support.
We're right behind you.
We wanna fight.
No Pasaran.
Kit...
I'm going to go to Spain.
What, just like that you're going to Spain?
Well, not just like that but...
It'll take a while to organise.
I'll go to Barcelona, sort it out from there.
Why you? Why have you got to go?
Because I can.
I haven't got any kids or nothing.
I mean, you know... what am I doing here, Kit?
I'm on fifteen bob a week on the dole.
Y'know, there's millions of us, out of work.
I'm on, you know, demon-strations, hunger marches just...
I know. I've been there with you.
I know. But I want to do something.
And you can't do it here?
If we've got to do it, we've got to do it now.
We've got to stop them otherwise it's not, it's going to be too late, Kit.
We'll have no future here.
I can't spare you.
Come here.
Dear Kit... well I made it.
It was a bit tricky and the sea was rough.
I was glad to get off that ship.
But Larry, who smuggled me aboard, turned up trumps.
He got us ashore, in one piece, at Marseilles... and put us on the road to Spain.
And then I hitched a lift in a couple of lorries to the border.
It seems there's no organisation here to help volunteers like me you've just got to make your own way.
With no passport, crossing the frontier wasn't easy and I had to walk across the Pyrenees.
I must have climbed for miles.
My boots are all shot to pieces and my feet are steaming.
I was scared stiff but we made it.
Would you like to sit down?
Would you like to sit down?
Madam, could you please move the chickens?
Now I'm in Spain and everything is so bright it hurts your eyes.
I've 'copped' the train for Barcelona.
Maybe I'll see some action.
He said that they could use your feet as a weapon against Franco.
What do you do here?
Oh, I've come to fight for the Republic.
Good. The more that come the sooner we'll win.
Do you want a drop?
Thanks.
Salud!
Gracias.
Smoke? Smoke?
Oh, with pleasure.
My name is Bernard.
Bernard Goujon.
Pleased to meet you. David Carr.
Bernard.
D'you smoke, lads?
Do you have papers, documentation?
Yeah, I've got my Party card.
My Com, Communist Party of Great Britain membership.
Yeah, I've got it here.
Look, it's like that.
See.
It's for a comrade of the POUM.
The what?
The POUM, P-O-U-M
Never heard of that?
No, never heard of the POUM.
It's Spainish workers' Party.
Revolutionaries.
Tickets, please.
He's with us, boss.
He's come to fight the fascists.
Welcome in Spain.
Thanks very much.
The Trade Union is controlling all the line.
Thanks.
Thanks.
So it's a present for you.
Oh, don't have to pay?
No, no, don't have to pay.
Thanks very much. Thanks, comrade.
Gracias.
Left, right, left, right...
Alto!
Halt!
Turn to right. Alto!
Turn to right. Alto!
Hey, dickhead. Make up your mind.
Shut up. I'm in charge here.
I'm pissed off with this.
This is important pick it up immediately.
You pick it up. I'm off.
Where are you going, love?
Don't call me "love".
Comrade, comrade...
I am going to Madrid. Understand?
They take things seriously there.
This is vital for the revolution for both men and women.
We've got to have discipline we'll never win without it.
Where are we going going to get to with this...
This is just the beginning.
I want a gun.
You'll get to fight...
Please trust me...
Get back in the line... what are you lot gawking at?
Let's have some energy.
I've seen more life in a sick note.
Right! Halt!
In Germany I was a pastry cook.
Pastry...
Yeah, pastry cook.
And you, Gene, what was your job?
Eleven years on the sea. Bosun.
Bosun?
Yes.
I've just spent six days on the sea and it was not for me.
I was, went from Liverpool to Marseilles and I was sick all the time.
So... I'm not a sailor.
I was a servant. A cleaner.
Servant. For an English family.
On the first day everything starts they went running to England so they left, they left me alone in Barcelona.
I'm free for the first time of my life.
Salud, camaradas.
Thank you, thank you.
You got the weapons?
Yes.
Antiques.
Antiques?
German, Mauser, 1896.
Single load.
How many?
Thirty.
Okay. All right.
Be better using a big stick.
Okay.
Get these off and take them over there into the 'store place'.
When did you learn about guns?
Five years in French Army,
I was sergeant.
Comrade. Where you from?
Italiano. Milano.
Italiano? So you know fascism?
They're bastards.
Que?
Do you need some help?
No, I'll do it myself.
Vale, leona.
Aye, aye, soft ollies.
Are you taking the piss?
Want to change?
Come here!
Sit down. Sit down, please.
Garibaldi, come here.
My name's Rafael Poccetti, Captain.
I know. But I need Garibaldis more than I need Poccettis.
Sit down, please.
Leona, tu tambien.
Okay.
In the other side of the hill are the trenches.
Our trenches.
And beyond them is the enemy.
And the only good soldier in Franco's Army is a dead one.
My name is Vidal and I'm your Captain.
We are the POUM and we organise this section of the, of the front.
To the west of us are the anarchists.
And we fight together, comrades in arms to defeat, to destroy the fascists and make the workers' and peasants' revolution.
Understand?
Don't forget it.
You are welcome here because you are my speaking squad English.
Okay?
We are proud to have you fight with us in our side.
Hey, David... look.
The whores are also at the front.
Yeah, but they're better looking than the ones back home.
Yeah?
Good morning, Coogan, your reinforcements are here now.
I thought it was Sunday.
Dear Kit. Well, I'm a soldier now with the POUM Militia.
It's a People's Army.
Just ordinary men and women fighting for a cause not like the Army back home.
There's no salutin'.
We elect the officers, and everything's discussed and voted on
It's socialism in action.
I'm in a special section... it's mainly internationals but some Spainish... and the common language is English, so we get by.
An Irishman called Coogan is in charge.
We're all on the same pay ten pesetas a day which is kept for us for when we go on leave.
And we also get a packet of fags a day, which isn't bad.
It's a huge operation, about twenty thousand militia on this front alone.
I'm not in the communist brigade, but it doesn't matter cos we're all fightin' the same enemy.
Viva Franco!
Viva Espana!
Fascists bastards. Rot in hell!
Sons of bitches!
Fascists, you've got no balls.
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
The food here's fuckin' brilliant!
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse.
Hey, rich bastard, you'll die with nothing.
I'm going to shove a bullet up your arse!
You must be used to this weather coming from your godforsaken town.
It never stops fuckin' raining!
You been, have you?
Yeah, five years, Manchester.
Staring at the poxy rain through prison bars.
What d'you get put down for?
Fightin' the Brits.
Murderer...
Murderer of a free nation.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
There's all sorts here...
French, German, Yanks,
Spanish of course, and a Scot by the name of Jimmy.
All good lads.
The front line doesn't seem to move.
We watch the fascists, and they watch us.
Lots of hanging about waitin' for something to happen.
Digging trenches, going out on patrol, sentry duty.
But worst of all is the lice.
They're worse than the nits back home.
They send you mad. They lay their eggs in the lining of your trousers and you can't get rid of 'em.
You're forever scratching.
The food's not great... it's usually bread and beans which gives us all a problem...
I could murder some cabbage and ribs.
The local women do the cooking.
It's strange to see women in the trenches fighting alongside the men.
But no need to worry, Kit, none of them could hold a candle to you.
Max...
You know what we said the other day when we came down... about Blanca being a whore.
You know, a prostitute.
Who? Who?
Who?
You said that Blanca was a prostitute - a whore!
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Good one.
Good one?
Good one!
Yeah!
Yours are winding me up.
Everybody knows... except you.
Maite...?
True.
You know, David, Blanca has told me some stories... crazy ones. Hard life...
Hard life... hard one!
In fact, Jose can tell you, you know.
He knows her very well, you know, because...
She knows how to do it... she's good and cheap.
Good and cheap, yeah.
Leave him alone.
David, it's the right moment.
Listen, she likes you, I tell you.
Good luck!
All right?
Yeah.
Do you want a cigarette?
No, thanks.
So, I mean, I was just thinking if you're not busy later on you might want to... you know, go for a walk with me.
You know...
I don't understand you.
Maybe me and you, you know, like... with, with Coogan.
When we saw you the other day...
Coogan is my man.
D'you understand?
Yeah. Si.
Before the war we live together.
We join in the militia together.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got... we fight together.
Sorry about that.
Sorry. Yeah.
I'll see you later then.
You shower of bastards!
You... I'll have a fuckin' word with you in a minute!
Have a nice time?
Have a nice time?
Yes, I did, thank you very much.
Marcel!
David?
Look.
Uh?
Fascist prisoners.
No!
An officer as well.
How many?
Besides the officer, there's...
Lawrence, Coogan, Jimmy.
I wonder where they found them?
I dunno.
This fucking senora wants a word with you.
Him and his sons, we found them behind the lines.
Doing a recce or something.
Anyway, they were lost.
At ease.
What's your name, lad?
Jose.
Jose?
Are you hungry?
Take them and get them something to eat, Jim.
And where are you going?
I've some questions for you.
I don't have to answer.
I'm a professional soldier.
Support the government elected by the people.
It's not a real government.
Muy bien...
How many soldiers in your command?
Have you got machine-guns?
Artillery?
Do your soldiers obey you?
Of course... we're a real army.

Mail.
No.
No.
No. Sorry.
Coogan, over here.
Oh, great.
Pigat...
Are you alright?
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Pigat!
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Leave me alone. I want to go home.
What's wrong?
I'm going home, okay?
Why?
I've got things to sort out.
You're crazy... you can't just leave like this.
I came here willingly and I'll leave when I feel like it, okay?
No, it's not that easy.
You can't just go when you want to.
There's a discipline here.
My woman's fucking another man.
Who'll sort it out?
You? Vidal?
Okay.
What are you going to do?
String the son of a bitch up by his balls.
And what good would that do?
Tell me, what good would that do?
Make me feel better.
Stay here... with your companeros.
I came here for her, for my daughter, the future.
You've got a daughter?
She was two last month.
What's her name?
Lidia.
Look... If we don't win this war there'll be no future for anybody.
Right?
Not for Lidia, not for your wife, not you, not me, not anyone.
Do you understand?
The photos'll give you some idea of how cold it was.
But what they don't show is how the rain turned everything into freezing mud.
We seemed to spend all our time searching for firewood anything that'd burn and keep us warm.
This Coogan fella's a bit of a wild one. Ex-IRA.
He's always first on patrol and last one back.
He knows what he's doing, but he does take chances.
His girlfriend's called Blanca.
She's in our section.
She's a bit of a character an' all.
Sharp as a razor.
They're not always hanging on to one another, but everyone knows they're a couple.
The worst thing about being here is doing nothing.
It seems we're just sittin' around and talkin' and arguin' politics all the time.
I come all this way to fight fascists and I can't get to grips with them.
Still... at last things are warming up a bit, not just the weather either.
Tomorrow's a big day.
We're attacking a village held by the fascists.
Think of us.
Lots of love, David.
Take off your sacks!
Vamos alla, valientes!
David, come on!
What's going on?
No! No!
Chuck us a cartridge.
Hey, chuck us a fucking cartridge!
There's women down there!
Danny, you can't be serious.
Give us a fucking cartridge!
Danny, you can't put their lives in danger.
Coogan! Coogan!
Fuego!
Don't shoot!
Speak to me!
Speak to me.
Speak to me!
This is the pig that was shooting from the tower.
Quiet!
Su rifle aun esta caliente.
I'm going to ask one simple question.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
Tell me the truth.
Have you fired this rifle?
No!
There's the proof.
What's this then?
Kill him!
He informed on five comrades from the Union, and they're dead now.
Yeah, kill him.
What happened?
They took my husband and shaved my head.
Why? Why?
Because my husband was in the militia.
Y no lo pudieren coger.
Eran anarquistas.
They were young anarchists.
Somebody say to the priest in confession where they were.
He told this to the fascists.
He knew the fascists kill them.
Murderer!
We've got to kill him.
Delato a nuestros companeros!
And we'll see you in three days...
Two or three days.
I'll stay here with twenty men for three days.
Very nice indeed.
Very nice.
I'm happy you appreciate French good taste.
Hola chico!
Gracias, amiga.
Blanca...
I just want you to know how sorry I am for what happened.
I should have opened fire but I didn't and, and they got him.
That's all there is to it.
The thing is, he was a good man.
You know, he was a brave man.
We're all going to miss him.
Yes, I know.
I know. I...
Oh, come on... come on... when I met him the first time... he was playing... how do you say...
The guitar?
No.
Yeah, the smaller one.
Banjo?
Yeah.
He was playing banjo.
In bars and cafes.
I'm sorry, Blanca, you know, it's my fault. And I...
No.
No, I'm...
I'm responsible because...
No.
You didn't kill him.
Fascists did.
He said he just wanted, like, bullets and I said that, like,
I wouldn't...
It could have happened sooner or later to any of us.
We feel a great sorrow today, but it must not halt our efforts.
Our companions have not died in vain.
Josefina, Sebastian, Teresa all of you we all fight for the same things as they did.
And we shall continue it's what they would have wanted.
They're here with us, fighting for the same cause.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many.
But we are more, we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
The struggle goes on.
They shall no pass.
We shall overcome.
Viva la revolucion!
Viva!
Muerte al fascismo!
Muerte!
Come on, sit down...
Friends...
Don Julian's house is now the house of the people.
Let's start the meeting.
Who's going to speak?
Teresa.
We must collectivise.
The men at the front have no food and the people in the village have been left with next to nothing by the fascists.
The village hasn't got enough food.
We must collectivise as soon as possible.
We must get food to feed our people and the comrades fighting for us at the front.
I'm in agreement with the collectivisation of Don Julian's lands or re-distribution in all its forms, but each to his own little bit... no?
Wait... Jose, speak.
I work my land my own way... it's not much, all that I have...
I started working it and... shit...
I've thrown everything into it.
Miguel. What would you like to say?
I'd like to say to our friend here that it's very good that he wants to work his own land, but how much better it would be if we all worked it together.
When the harvest is ready, are you going to eat all the wheat and all the potatoes?
You are not to say so... we need everything to be able... to keep the revolution going.
The revolution has to be done this way.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
Jose, it's not only a question of land.
Hay que hacer una sociedad nueva!
Un momento, Miguel, que Aniceto habia...
Yo habia pedido la palabra, y a nosotros nos dejais de lado.
The revolution is like a pregnant cow, if we don't help out... the cow and its calf will be gone and the children will be left hungry.
Remember that comrades, boys, died in this battle.
We must collectivise.
Do you understand me?
The people must eat.
This struggle we've started has to continue.
There are those who are the way they are and there are those who know how to work and people who don't...
I've got what I've got because I work.
Hold on. Paco's turn.
It's fundamental that improve our harvests... we must grow more.
Othere villages have done it by working all the land as one.
With a tractor you can do five times more work in one day than you can with a mule.
Un momento. No hablemos todos juntos. Un momento.
Sebastian.
There's evidence from other villages that it's working.
I believe we have to take over private property.
No one's got anything.
We could pool all our resources and depending on each person's situation we could share it out.
If you need a cow, you'll get one.
We've all got four or five kids... and we've all buse a gut working, just like you.
Hey! Momento!
Momento, companeros... we've got militia comrades here who may know what's happening elsewhere... they've helped us here.
Teresa...
Pepe's right.
Our friends from the militia will have seen what's happened in other villages.
This is an open meeting you can speak, too.
Your opinions are as welcome as any of ours. Please speak.
It's your village. You have to decide. It's your decision.
Okay, this is what I think, and if anybody disagrees they should just say so right out.
Si. Okay. You should take this estate, this house, this land and divide it up amongst the people in the town right away.
Okay. The decree passed by the Republican Government in October allows for that.
Okay. It says all property owned by individuals involved in the insurrection will be confiscated.
Si, si.
The problem's different here... all the landowners help Franco.
We must collectivize all the lands.
You understand?
Todas las tierras, hay que colectivizar no solo dividir.
I understand that.
I understand that.
I'm not, I'm not a friend of the landowner. Okay?
I'm not here to defend landowners.
Okay?
But what are you going to do when you have a guy like, what's his name, Pepe?
What are you going to do when you have a guy like Pepe who has... he's a tenant farmer and he has a couple of acres of land... or a tradesman who doesn't want to be part of your collective? Okay?
These people are anti-fascists.
What do you do then?
It sounds really great on paper, but in reality it won't work... because it's going to pit the peasants against the anti-fascists. Okay?
You're fighting now and it's going to endanger your food production.
Lawrence, I think that private ownership of land must be totally given up, forgotten, cancelled... because it maintains people in a capitalist mentality.
I agree. Okay.
I agree with, I mean,
I'm not here to argue for, for private property.
I know the definition of private property.
I know what it does.
Okay, I'm not arguing that.
This is not the time for these textbook arguments on socialism or land reform.
We have to defeat fascism, that's the priority.
Are you suspecting this man to, to speak about the textbook of... socialism?
No, I'm not!
Well, I'm,
I'm agreeing with him. Okay?
I'm agreeing with the collectivisation, all right?
But these people cannot collectivise anything if they're dead. Okay?
Well, this is, is your opinion.
My opinion!
They asked for my opinion.
No, but in my village, the people didn't wait for the government to give them the land.
They took it themselves.
Nadie espero a que les dijesen que tenian que hacer con la tierra, la cogieron ellos mismos.
I want you to think beyond this village, okay at a much bigger picture.
Okay. I have no doubt that the Spanish people, on their own, could have 'licked' Franco.
But you're not fighting just Franco, you now have Mussolini and Hitler on your back.
Okay. With the exception of Russia and Mexico... the rest of the world has turned its back on you. Okay?
They refuse to sell the Republic arms.
Okay. These are capitalists, these are capitalist countries!
They're capitalist countries, and if you want their help you have to moderate your slogans cos you're scaring them away!
I'm from Germany.
We wanted revolution and what happened?
We'd been the strongest movement in Europe... the best organised workers' movement.
There were six million of us in unions and what happened?
Hitler...
The socialists and the communists told us... to make our revolution later.
But I say make the revolution now.
When people see as the village sees that you can be in charge of your life, your land, when collectivisation becomes a reality, it'll be possible for people in Germany, Italy, to follow our example.
These people think they have, they think they have something, but they have nothing!
But we have to show to the people that, that we have... we're poor but we're alive and we've got power now, we don't have to be seized by fear.
We're alive, we'll die when our time comes, but...
All French working people are, are looking to us in Spain, probably all around the world and I think it is not the right time to fight, to fight each other but together.
Now all of us know the price of the freedom and we, we've lost a lot of friends.
Gene, your kedas are very seductive but I've got one question for you.
Who are you trying to appease... foreign governments, foreign bankers?
What is a revolution?
It's nothing other than a radical change in privilege, wealth and power.
What's going to happen, what'... the only way we'll appease, the only way we'll appease these people when the ideas are diluted and watered down till they mean absolutely nothing.
Now I think you're dead right when you say when you say that they must look beyond this village, and must look at what's happening outside.
Okay, but not only to foreign bankers and foreign governments.
What we must look to as well is that outside these windows, as we speak, on this land are two million landless peasants.
From the day they were born they had absolutely no hope other than a life of misery.
And unless we harness that energy now the ideas will be dead, there'll be no change and this will all be in vain.
Ideas are the basis of this.
Jimmy...
Jimmy, those people will be dead never mind the ideas!
If Franco comes in, you know, if Franco wins this war he'll just kill a million of those people.
They're nothing to him.
They're just a piece of shit!
That's obvious, I agree with that.
Exactly. So, unless we win the war, there's no point in having the ideology.
The ideology does not exist in, in like, in a book.
It exists, has to exist in place.
It'd have to be real, for real people.
I say that we have to take risks.
What do we do?
Misery, hunger, hopelessness.
Franco might come back and kill us but I say it's worth it to continue collectivising and improving the quality of our lives.
Let's vote!
All those in favour of collectivisation.
All those against.
Friends, the vote is to collectivise the land.
You all right? Want a hand?
Yeah.
I thought maybe your foot was hurtin'.
It's okay, thank you.
No problem.
Hola.
Hola.
And you talk about being poor.
Who?
You. With Coogan that night.
We were just talking about when we were kids.
I tell you what poor is.
Two pesetas a day for agricultural labours if you're lucky.
Peasant families living in caves or sandpits that is poor.
That is why we need the revolution.
Don't laugh!
I'm not laughing.
I saw you!
I wasn't laughing!
D'you want a hand with that?
Oh, I can see you've got one.
Don't say any more!
What I'm saying, Kit, is that I'm not the man I was.
I feel like I'm standing on higher ground, if you see what I mean.
I can see further and, and I notice things
I hadn't even thought of before.
Like I, I left Liverpool with a daft romantic idea but in war people get killed.
Fellas like Coogan... and the women and kids who died in this village that's all part of me now and I'll never shake it off.
Fascist planes dropped leaflets on us yesterday saying how they was winning the war.
Well, myself, it's hard to know what's going on in the rest of Spain.
But here, on the Aragon front, we're holding our own.
And if only we had decent arms.
Who knows?
Perhaps a line of Russian tanks will come rolling over the hill.
Some hope, eh?
Pigat, Garibaldi, Roca...
Listen...
Max...
Come here.
Companeros, listen please.
I have to go to the Command Post for a very important meeting with the General Staff of the Column.
And I say, very important because we are going to discuss about our integration in the new Popular Army.
There is no choice.
The government in Valencia says no more militia and say we all must become part in the new communist led Popular Army.
Okay? So, if we refuse they continue to withhold arms.
To keep arms from us.
Do you understand?
Let's take a vote, no? Votamos?
I have something to say, please.
Please.
Excuse me a moment, please.
This is probably the last time that we can vote on something as a militia. All right?
Please.
Maybe we could integrate to the new Popular Army and get the weapons join together and be still in the militia too.
You're a dreamer, Pigat.
It's impossible.
Look, I think we have, we have to try to see the reality of the situation here. Okay?
Who's ever gonna give us guns, the Russians or whomever they're not going to give them to us if they don't think that we know how to use them and that we're not properly trained.
So it makes sense that the best training is going to come from a regular disciplined army.
That's obvious. I can't see what's wrong with that at all.
Everything is wrong.
The creation of the new army with its saluting and discipline and military hierarchy will destroy the revolutionary spirit of the people. Okay?
And it's exactly what Stalinists expect.
What?
That makes no sense, Bernard.
Absolutely.
The Communist Party was set up for revolution.
Why would they want to suppress the revolutionary spirit?
It is no more revolutionary.
Look, the militia is the heart of the struggle.
Stalin fears us because he wants to sign treaties with the west and he already did, did it with France.
So, to sign treaties, to reach an agreement... he needs to be respectable and reassuring.
Okay?
So, if he supports us and the revolution we are making... he will lost his... respectability.
That's the reason why we are a real threat for Stalin and also for the other countries.
I don't know, Bernard, I... what you are saying might be right,
I don't know.
I don't know. Okay.
But I do know we're not going to win this war with a bunch of amateurs.
You may be an amateur, I'm not!
Jesus Christ!
We've done, we've done okay up, up to now, Gene.
We could have done better with guns.
We saved Valencia,
Madrid, Barcelona... and we lost Toledo,
Malaga and more... we've got to be clear about one thing here.
There's blackmail going on.
If we accept those arms, they come with conditions.
They're not interested in partners, they want stooges.
Let's vote...
Let them know what we think.
Do we support our General Stafe when they insist on keeping our own revolutionary organisations?
Si?
Everybody?
Si.
It's a clear majority.
Now watch.
Put the bullet in here.
Yes?
Understand?
That's it.
You take off the catch and it's ready for firing.
Si...
Come on then, "Mr Laurel".
Remarkable resemblance. Remarkable.
Even down to the blank expression.
There you go.
You need to hold the rifle harder against your shoulder.
Fire.
Whey!
How's your shoulder?
You're afraid of the rifle.
Si.
Yes.
Hold it firmly like this.
You mustn't jerk the trigger.
Squeeze it like a woman's tits.
Understand?
Have you ever squeezed a woman's tits?
Yeah.
Yes? I'll bet you have.
Hold on a minute.
Fuck!
Come quickly.
I know.
Are you okay?
Get a stick.
A stick!
Hey, hey, try to keep calm.
Is he all right?
Yeah, yeah! I'm all right!
We must get him to the hospital.
What happened? What happened?
Fucking rifle blew up in my face.
Jesus! Piece of shit!
Jesus!
Are you satisfied now?
This is the shitty equipment you voted for!
Don't you have anything better to say?
Please give him some peace.
Don't you see?
Yeah, I can see. I see a stupid idealist with a death wish.
Can't you see what's going on here?
It's over!
It's kaput! It's finished.
Jesus, easy, easy man!
Oh fuck! I've had it!
I cannot stay here watching people die of stupidity!
I can't do it! I've had it!
I'm getting out of this! Fuck it!
David, if you had any fucking brains you'd do the exact same thing!
Davey, let me see your eyes.
Are your eyes okay?
Yeah.
Oh, you daft bastard!
How's that?
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
I'm all right.
Open your eyes.
Easy...
How far is this place?
About four miles.
They patch you up and send you to the hospital in Barcelona.
When you get out of the hospital... you'll need somewhere to rest for a while before you come back.
Yeah.
I know a place, a pension in Barcelona where the people from the POUM stay.
Would you like the address?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.
You stay there yourself, this pension?
Yeah, sometimes.
I know the old lady.
You stay there.
Tell her my name.
I will.
I'll say: "Blanca sent me. Can you give me a nice room, please?".
Look after yourself, Blanca.
I'll see you soon.
Is this boarding house around here?
The Pension Adela?
Hello.
Do you have a room for me?
Who are you?
My friend Blanca sent me...
I like having English people, they are clean and tidy.
This is my room?
This is yours.
Si.
Hola.
Hello.
How are you?
Great. What are you doing here?
You're not pleased to see me?
Yeah. Yeah. Just shocked.
How's your arm?
Oh, it's much better now.
I had the stitches taken out two days ago.
What are you doing here?
Bernard gave me seven days leave.
I thought I would surprise you.
You definitely have, without doubt.
I bought some wine.
It's on the table.
I'll be with you in a minute.
All right, yeah.
Help yourself.
Pour a glass for me.
Si, claro!
Please.
How's Bernard?
He's fine.
You know.
Women aren't allowed to fight any more.
New rules.
Yeah, I heard.
I can be a nurse.
I can drive a truck.
I can be a cook.
But I mustn't shoot a gun any more.
I must know my place as a woman.
Maite is going to be a cook.
No!
Yes.
She will... she will be the worst in the militia.
Well that's without doubt.
It doesn't sound at all like her.
Things are changing very quickly.
Yeah? What did Vidal say about the whole thing?
No... please.
I don't want to talk about it.
All right.
Today I want to forget it all... bullets, trenches... politics, killings, betrayals.
I want to feel human for a change.
Salut.
Salut.
Take off your shirt.
What?
Come on.
Take off your shirt!
All right, all right.
All right.
It's got buttons, you know.
Take care.
What's going on?
The police from the old days.
And now they are back.
No guns for us at the front... and here in Barcelona the police have guns sticking out of their arse.
I'll make some coffee.
Do you have some matches?
What?
No matches.
Yeah, there's some matches in my bag.
What is this?
What?
This?
We get no uniforms like this in the militia.
Look...
I meant to tell you.
I'm not in the militia any more.
I've joined the International Brigade.
I leave for Albacete on Friday.
Stalinist!
Come on. Come on.
You vote!
You vote to keep the militia!
Yeah, but... things are different now.
I've changed my mind.
It's because of Lawrence?
No!
He left the day after!
No, it's not because of that!
I'm a member of the Communist Party.
I've never hidden it.
But you fought with us!
With the POUM!
Yeah, I fought with the POUM.
And look at the fuck that happened to me.
I've got a big piece of metal in my arm.
But you know perfectly well why!
You know they refuse us arms!
David! The Stalinists are betraying the revolution!
I don't believe that.
Go to La Batalla.
Talk to them there.
I haven't got to talk to
La Batalla.
I've been in hospital,
I was talking to others.
Our leaders have been expelled from the government.
That's politics.
That's the way politics works.
No! They are trying to ban us.
Say we are, we are social fascists!
And you know, you know this!
You know our papers are banned, journalists arrested and here they even talk about torture chambers.
Camaras de tortura!
I don't know that, do I? I'll wait till I see it with my own eyes.
But you don't see it!
You don't want to see it.
Why you didn't tell me yesterday?
I was going to tell you.
I meant to tell you, just...
Liar!
Come on, look. I've tried but...
Blanca...
I came to Spain to fight for socialism, to fight for the Republic!
And the best way
I can think to do that is with the International Brigades.
And if, if what you're saying is true then I'm sure there's a good reason.
There's an explanation of some sort.
Of course it's true!
And there is an explanation.
It's called Stalinism!
Look, what are you going to do now?
I go back to the front, where my real comrades are.
Oh look, come on! Blanca!
For fucks sake, Blanca.
Listen!
Blanca!
Look after yourself, will ya?
Please.
(GERMAN EAGLES
ON GUERNICA BOMBS)
So that's why I'm in Barcelona.
It's dead complicated, Kit, and difficult to explain.
The problem is the struggle seems to be falling apart in front of our eyes.
No-one trusts anyone any more.
Anarchists and POUM are pulling one way, communists in another.
It's mad. All I can do is believe the Party.
They must know what they're doing.
JOINT PLANS TO
BREAK MADRID FRONT
The city is like a powder keg waiting to go off.
Trucks of assault guards everywhere.
And now there's trouble at the telephone exchange which is run by the anarchists.
The police just took it by force.
They say the anarchists are sabotaging the war effort by interfering with government business.
There's fighting in the streets, barricades going up all over the place.
There's shootin's.
Comrades against comrades.
Fascist must be laugh that, that's all.
David.
The attack of the telephone exchange is a declaration of war against the working class... what are the POUM up to?
A general strike has been called in all industries except those producing weapons...
Plants, machine shops, warehouses... are stopping work.
The barricades of liberty have risen again in every part of town!
Arm yourselves to defend the revolution!
You should be killing fascists not one another!
What are you saying?
We've got nothing to eat.
D'you hear?
We've got to put food on the table.
Please get out of the way.
Sorry, friend.
I'm sorry.
Bastards!
Hey, you, Stalin's sidekick.
What division were you in?
The Karl Marx Division.
And you? The Third Division?
No, you bastard. We're from the Durutti Division, the best.
You don't even know who's your enemy. You idiots!
You idiots!
You have betrayed the revolution.
That's a lie.
You are the ones who have broken the anti-fascists front.
I've been at the front and I know.
Are you English?
Yeah. You?
Where are you from?
Manchester.
Fucking hell, I'm from Liverpool.
What you doin' here?
Don't know.
Why aren't you over here with us?
Why aren't you over here with us?
I don't fucking know.
We can smell food, fascists.
What are you cooking, bastards?
Sausages and beans. Are you hungry?
You bet!
Then here you are.
No more. Never.
We're not enemies.
My friend, Martin, returned from the front dying of hunger.
It's a disaster.
Which front?
Aragon.
When it's decision time, everyone is the boss.
They say they don't even know how to load the guns.
Get away!
They say the militia women aren't killing fascists, they are fucking them instead!
They fuck them.
They do nothing.
They're crap.
They're a disaster, they take
4 totally inexperienced men.
That's a lie.
I'm from the front.
I'm in the militia.
You're in the militia?
You're in the militia?
He can't even speak properly.
What? What are you saying?
Listen, you're a fucking kid.
You know fuck all.
Do you understand me?
Yes, a kid.
You don't know nothing.
You've seen fuck all.
What's going on?
Son of a bitch!
Quiet! You fucking know-nothing, you little snotty-nosed little kid!
What's going on? That's enough.
Are you mad, or what?
What do you think is going on?
If the leaders of the POUM and CNT get together, we're fucked.
That's what's happening!
They need to come from abroad to tell us that?
At least it's good that they're here.
Lazarus.
Yeah. Back from the dead.
Is that you?
Yeah. Gone but not forgotten, eh?
Has vuelto?
Si.
Roca! Andres!
Que tal amigo?
Yeah.
Are you a spy of the communists?
Si.
Fucking English. You're welcome.
Good to see you.
We have a new cook now.
Maite! Maite!
Fucking shit, the woman's doing the cooking...
Hola, amigo!
David!
David!
Si!
What are you doing here?
I came back for something to eat.
Oh great!
I heard you'd taken over the cooking.
No, seriously, what happened?
No, seriously, what's on the menu?
Seriously...
Fucking beans!
Go to hell, Pigat.
It's terrible!
Hola.
Fine.
And you?
So so.
What are you doing here?
Did you see with your own eyes?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I saw a lot of things with my own eyes.
Things I didn't want to see.
All right?
Yeah...
Bueno.
Amiga.
I'm glad to see you again.
Si, si. Yo tambien.
The party stinks, Kit.
And I never thought the day'd come when I'd have to say that.
It's evil and corrupt.
In Barcelona I saw good comrades snatched off the streets and executed others disappeared into torture chambers, and it's still going on.
Stalin is just using the working class like pieces on a chessboard to be bartered, used and sacrificed.
Things have changed while I've been away.
Some of the old faces are missing because they couldn't stomach all the in-fighting and all-in-all we've taken a bit of a battering.
It's rumored we're going to make a big attack soon and still no weapons, no support.
But this one we're going to win.
Despite everything, our spirits are high.
Keep cover!
Viva!
Medico!
Medico!
We have had many casualties.
They're bombing us...
Liste... where's the cover you promised?
What kind of position is this?
Nobody's come.
You don't understand anything.
Nobody's come.
We can't hold on.
Those fucking Stalinist bastards.
This should have been over hours ago, mate.
They should have fucking taken that hill hours ago.
Trust them just to make a fucking point.
They've dumped us, Davey!
Madruga.
Si...
Ammunition!
Wait...
I'm waiting!
I'm not going anywhere, am I?
See we're hemmed in here, mate.
They know where we are.
Where are they?
Wher's the asaltos?
Never mind in fucking reserve!
We're fucked here... we can't hold this position any longer.
We must stay here.
No. We can't. We don't have any weapons. We don't have... we must show them what we are, Bernard.
Listen, they know exactly what's happening here.
Nobody's sending arms or the army.
We will die alone, here, and you will do their game.
We are fighters.
Bernard, we are fighters!
It's an order.
We're fucked here...
This is madness.
You've got to hold on.
Yes, sir.
Retreat immediately.
Why are you giving me this order when you've just told me to hold the position?
All right?
I also want to know... listen... why we've been risking our lives here waiting for the promised reinforcements. All right?
Whatever you say, sir.
Madruga, Andres, come here and the rest, quickly.
Garibaldi, Roca, we're going back to our old positions.
Come on, Roca.
Bernard, to the left with Jimmy.
David, cover this flank. Come on!
Quickly, orderly, orderly... go with them...
Come on, David.
All of you get back.
Come on... back...
Come on...
My fucking leg!
Blanca, come here.
Orderly. Orderly, there's a bad one, quick!
Stay with them.
Come on, Jimmy!
Be brave.
Oh, my leg!
Mira, mira, the cavalry have come.
If they've come to fight, they're a bit late for that one, aren't they?
Hey, Gene. Gene!
Gene... what are you doing here?
Gene, what are you doing here?
Take it easy.
Bernard, keep everybody calm.
Stay where you are!
Quiet, everybody.
What the hell's going on?
Listen.
Drop your weapons on the ground, immediately.
Obey the order!
What's going on, Lawrence?
Listen.
Es una orden.
What's the meaning of this?
Can we know why?
Officer, get your men to obey.
I refuse.
Obey my orders!
From now on this unit is disbanded.
You can all go home, except for the following who are under arrest.
Quiet!
Juan Vidal
Bernard Goujon
Miguel Angel Campos
Rafael Jimenez
Ni locos... what are we accused of?
The POUM is now illegal.
Your newspaper has been banned and your leaders arrested.
What charges?
Conspiring with the fascists... collaborating with Franco!
Is this conspiracy?
Is this conspiracy, Colonel?
Jesus!
It's a lie... it's a lie... while we've been getting fucking shot...
Don't look at the ground look at me face to face.
It's not a relection on you it's your leaders.
It's a Stalinist plot.
The fucking government's a load of bollocks!
Sietamo, what about Sietamo?
Alcubierre?
Come on, Gene, what about the people...
Lecinena?
Casetas de Quisena? Tierz?
Navales?
They're all places liberated by the POUM.
Were they fascists who did that?
What about fucking Coogan and the others, who died?
Are we all fascists all of a sudden?
Were these places liberated by fascists, too?
It was the men of the POUM who defended Madrid.
Were these places liberated by Franco?
Quiet! Obey my orders!
Prepare to fire!
Take it easy!
Take it easy!
Quiet!
What shall we do with the wounded?
Madruga, quiet!
You're under arrest.
Do as he says.
What happened in Barcelona with our comrades? Murderers!
They're going to shoot you...
Murderers!
Control your men, Captian.
Control your men, Captian.
Fight with us against fascism.
Fascist bastard, come here and say that face to face with us.
Come here.
Coward, coward, come here.
Blanca!
They have to do this.
Come here.
Coward, come here!
They have to do this.
You're being tricked.
You're being tricked by your own leaders!
You're being lied to!
Fight with us.
They're tricking you.
You are tricking us!
No, the leaders of the POUM are tricking you!
You are tricking us!
Lawrence, open your eyes!
Come here, coward.
They have proof.
Come here! Come here!
Blanca...!
Silence...
You idiots. God Almighty!
Silence...
Murderers...
Vidal... what the fuck did you do that for?
We've fought for nothing, comrades.
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
You bastards...
Murderers...
Murderers... we've fought for nothing, comrades.
Lower your guns.
Death to Stalinism!
Long live the revolution...
Open your eyes!
Long live the revolution.
Down with fascism.
Thank you very much.
We buried Blanca in collectivised land.
She would have liked that... even though the Stalinists came four weeks later and broke up the commune.
At least the earth belonged to her for a short while.
I'm trying to get home, Kit, but it won't be easy.
They have a "wanted" list ad, as a so-called deserter and supporter of the POUM, my name's on it.
There are no "safe" houses and we spend our time hiding out in building sites and living rough.
Some of the most sincere and dedicated fighters against fascism have been murdered.
But if you get this letter... understand that I regret nothing.
Revolutions are contagious, and had we succeeded here... and we could have done.
We would have changed the world.
But never mind... our day will come.
We shall leave them in the ground, but the earth is ours now, comrades, and from this place we must draw the strength to fight on.
The battle is long and our foes are many, but we are more... we shall always be many more.
Tomorrow is ours, comrades.
Can I just say something a minute?
The other day, I found this.
It was amongst, like, my granddad's papers.
And I just thought it was, like, fitting for him.
It's a poem by William Morris, and I'd just like to read it out.
"Join in the battle"
"wherein no man can fail"
"For whoseo fadeth and dieth"
"Yet his deeds shall all still prevail"
- How are you?
- Okay.
Your leg will be fine.
A lot of shrapnel came out.
I saved you the pieces.
You are the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.
I don't think so.
Here.
- Would you kiss me?
- No. I'll get you some tea.
- It would mean such a lot to me.
- Would it?
Thank you.
- Nurse, I can't sleep.
- Would you kiss me?
- You're so pretty.
- Will you tuck me in, please?
Very funny.
Go to sleep now.
- Where's the doctor?
- Don't ask.
God, I hate giving blood.
Can't stand needles.
Is there anybody from Picton?
Picton?
I don't know.
I'd like to see somebody from home before I go.
- Do we have anybody from Picton?
- Why Picton?
He's from there. Edge of Lake Ontario, right, soldier?
That's where your sweetie's from, isn't it? Around there?
Ask him what company he's with.
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Does he know Captain McGan?
He bought it yesterday.
Shot to bits.
- What did he say?
- Doesn't know him.
Hana, get down!
He's dead. He's dead.
He's dead.
He's dead.
Name, rank, serial number?
No, sorry.
I think I was a pilot.
I was found in the wreckage of a plane at the beginning of the war.
Can you remember where you were born?
Am I being interrogated?
You should be trying to trick me, make me speak German.
- Which I can, by the way.
- Why?
- Are you German?
- No.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Might-- Might I have a sip of water?
- Thank you.
- It's okay.
I remember lots of things.
I remember her garden, plunging down to the sea.
- Nothing between you and France.
- This was your garden?
- Or my wife's.
- You were married then?
I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans.
Look.
I have this much lung.
The rest of my organs are packing up.
What could it possibly matter if I'm a Tutankhamen?
I'm a bit of... toast, my friend.
Sorry I can't help you.
Are you all right?
I know you hate to be moved.
I'm sorry.
Hana!
- Jan?
- Hana!
There's meant to be lace in the next village. 
The boys are gonna take me.
- You don't have any money, do ya?
- No.
- Just in case there's a sale.
- No.
Hana, I know you do.
Come on.
- No!
- Oh, come on.
I swear to God, this'll be the last time. I swear.
She's a softie.
She loves me.
I'll pay you back! I promise!
I'm not sewing anything else for you.
I love you!
Whoa!
Pienza, boys!
Get some water over here!
Jan!
Oh, no!
Hana, where're you going?
- Stay back!
- Stop, Hana!
Stay--
No!
No!
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't move!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Stand absolutely still!
You're walking in a mine field!
Good.
That's good.
Just stay still for me... and we'll be fine.
What are you doing?
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
It's Jan's.
Are you in pain?
Do you need something?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Are you okay?
- You and Jan were--
- We keep moving him in and out of the truck.
Why? He's dying. 
What's the point?
We can hardly leave him.
Do you mean leave him?
No, no, I don't mean leave him.
This will help you.
I must be a curse.
Anybody who loves me... anybody who gets close to me--
Oh, I must be cursed.
Which is it?
- When he dies, I'll catch up.
- It's not safe here.
The whole country's crawling with bandits and Germans and God knows what.
- It's madness! I can't allow it.
- The war is over.
How can it be desertion?
It's not over everywhere.
I didn't mean literally.
This is normal, a shock, for all of us, Hana.
I need morphine, a lot.
And a pistol.
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.
We're heading for Leghorn.
"Livorno", the Italians call it.
We'll expect you.
Fine.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.
- Oh, Hana.
- I'll be okay.
I'll catch up.
Good.
What-- What was all that banging?
Are you-- Are you fighting rats or the entire German army?
No. I was repairing the stairs.
I found a library, and the books were very useful.
Before you find too many uses for those books, you might read some to me.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.
- What about your own book?
- My book?
Oh, yes, the Herodotus.
Yes, you can read him.
Oh. I found plums.
We have plums in the orchard. 
There.
We have an orchard.
Herodotus is the father of history.
- Do you know that?
- I don't know anything.
Hmm.
It's a--
It's a very plum... plum.
A mountain the shape of a woman's back. 
Good, good.
- Hello, Geoffrey!
- Madox, hello!
- Welcome to the expedition.
- How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton.
Splendid to finally meet you all.
This is Dante D'Agostino and Diggy Bermann, our archaeologist.
- Beautiful plane.
- This is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist.
- And this is my wife, Katharine.
- Hello.
We're your new apprentices.
Welcome to the International Sand Club.
- To the International Sand Club.
- I'll get cups.
- Marvelous plane. Did you look?
- Yes.
Isn't it? A wedding present from Katharine's parents.
We're calling it Rupert Bear.
- Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
- Almasy.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrap heap.
Mrs. Clifton, I'd like to present...
- Count Almasy.
- Hello.
Geoffrey gave me your monograph and I was reading up in the desert.
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.
I wanted to meet the man who could write a long paper with so few adjectives.
Well, a thing is still a thing, no matter what you place in front of it.
Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car.
- Broken car.
- It's still a car.
- Not much use, though.
- Love?
Romantic love, platonic love, filial love.
- Quite different things, surely.
- Uxoriousness.
That's my favorite kind of love.
Excessive love of one's wife.
Now there you have me.
- They're tourists.
- Absolute rot.
They're highly recommended by the Royal Geographic Society.
She's charming and has read everything.
- He's meant to be a ruddy good flier.
- We don't need another pilot.
He can make aerial maps of the whole route.
You can't explore from the air, Madox.
If you could explore from the air, life would be very simple.
Contact.
Contact.
I should try and move the bed.
I want you to be able to see the view.
It's good. 
It's a view from a monastery.
- I can already see.
- How?
- How can you see anything?
- No, no, not the window.
I can't bear the light anyway.
I can see all the way to the desert.
I'm turning you.
Exploring before the war, making maps.
Is there sand in my eyes?
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
No sand.
That's your morphine speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
- Could I have a cigarette?
- Are you crazy?
Why-- Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Because I'm a nurse.
Bravo.
We have an old-fashioned tomato
A Long Island potato
But yes
We have no bananas
We have no bananas today
- Next!
- Katharine!
"The King insisted that he would find some way...
"to prove beyond dispute...
"that his wife was fairest of all women.
"'I will hide you in your room where we sleep', said Candaules--
- said Candaules."
- Candaules.
"Candaules."
Candaules.
Candaules tells Gyges that the Queen has the same practice every night.
She takes off her clothes... and puts them on the chair by the door to her room.
"And from where you stand,
you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure."
And that evening, it's exactly as the King has told him.
She goes to the chair, removes her clothes one by one, until she's standing naked in full view of Gyges.
And indeed, she was more lovely than he could have imagined.
But then, the Queen looked up... and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows.
And although she said nothing, she shuddered.
And the next day, she sends for-- for Gyges and challenged him.
- And hearing his story, this is what she said.
- Off with his head!
She said, 
"Either you must submit to death...
"for gazing on that which you should not,
"or else kill my husband who has shamed me...
and become King in his place."
So Gyges kills the King, marries the Queen and becomes ruler of Lydia for 28 years.
The end.
Shall I spin the bottle?
So, Geoffrey, let that be a lesson to you.
- D'Agostino!
- D'Agostino!
Are you asleep?
Yes.
No. I'm dropping off.
Go away!
Go! Go!
Buon giorno.
- Hana?
- What do you want?
I met your friend Mary.
She said I should stop and see if you were all right.
Apparently we're neighbors. 
My house is two blocks from yours in Montreal.
Cabot, north of Laurier.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
For you.
I'd like to take credit for it, but it's from Mary.
My name is David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David.
Caravaggio they find too absurd to miss out on.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, shit.
Stupid hands.
Let me do that.
They're fresh.
I haven't had an egg in--
Have you noticed there are chickens?
In Italy, you get chickens but no eggs.
In Africa, they're always eggs but never chickens.
- Who's separating them?
- You were in Africa?
Yes, I was.
So was my patient.
Look, I'd like to stay for a while.
I have to do some work here.
I speak the language.
There are partisans to be disarmed.
We embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know, while we hide.
I was a thief, so the army thought I'd be good at it.
- So you can shoot a pistol?
- No.
Do you have a problem with those?
No.
- I should look at them before you go.
- Look.
It's a big place.
We needn't disturb each other.
I'll sleep in the stable.
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don't sleep.
I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company.
I don't need to be looked after.
There is a man downstairs.
He brought us eggs.
He might stay.
Why?
Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with one from the same place?
What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street?
Did you invite him to live with you?
He needn't disturb you.
He can't.
I'm already disturbed.
There's a war. 
Where you come from becomes important.
Why? I hate that idea.
Ah!
It's gonna work.
Gently.
Can I help?
It's finished.
So, you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Thief I think is more accurate.
I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
All over?
I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.
- Are you leaving us?
- Yes.
Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Then I'm definitely going.
Does she have war wounds?
I think anybody she ever loves...
tends to die on her.
- Are you planning to be the exception?
- Me?
I think you've got... the wrong end of the stick, old boy.
So...
Caravaggio.
Hana thinks you invented your name.
And you've forgotten yours.
I said that no one would ever invent such a preposterous name.
And I said you can forget everything, but you never forget your name.
Count Almasy.
That name mean anything to you?
Or Katharine Clifton?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How much did you pay?
- Oh, hello.
They don't see foreign women in this market. 
How much did you pay?
Um, £7, £8, I suppose.
- Which store?
- Why?
You've been cheated.
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to take it back.
- This is not worth £8.
- It is to me.
- Did you bargain?
- I don't care to bargain.
That insults them.
I don't believe that. 
I think that you're insulted by me somehow.
I'd be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.
I apologize if I appear abrupt.
I'm rusty at social graces.
How do you find Cairo?
- Did you visit the pyramids?
- Excuse me.
Or the Sphinx?
Latitude, 25, 33.
Longitude, 25, 16.
We attempt to drive northeast of Kofer, we'll leave our bones in the desert.
- I disagree.
- You're Hungarian. You always disagree.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
- How is your charming wife?
- Marvelous.
She's in love with the hotel plumbing.
She's either in the swimming pool.
She swims for hours.
She's a fish. It's quite incredible.
Or she's in the bath.
Actually, she's just outside.
Chaps only in the Long Bar.
Mrs. Clifton.
You'll have to forgive us. 
We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Not at all. 
I was thoroughly enjoying my book.
- The team is in mourning, darling.
- Oh, really?
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Oh. Well, what'll you do?
More modest expedition, or even wait a year.
- It's a disaster.
- Remind our families we still exist.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Very much so.
We all are.
- Save my friend Almasy here.
- I feel much better.
Don't you, darling?
We were feeling rather self-conscious.
Let's toast, then.
Absent wives.
- Absent wives.
- And present ones.
And future ones.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
May I?
- Why did you follow me yesterday?
- I'm sorry. What?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I was concerned. 
A woman in that part of Cairo, a European woman.
- I felt obliged to.
- You felt obliged to?
As the wife of one of our party.
So why follow me?
Escort me, by all means.
But following me is predatory, isn't it?
Could I ask you to move?
I'm sorry, but I--
I'm sorry.
Of course.
- It's just when you move.
- How stupid of me.
- I can't really bear the pressure--
- Are you all right?
I was dreaming.
Awful.
Hana.
Hana, are you all right?
Leave me alone.
You're in love with him, aren't you?
Your poor patient.
You think he's a saint because of the way he looks.
I don't think he is.
I'm not so in love with him.
I'm in love with ghosts.
So is he.
He's in love with ghosts.
What if I told you he did this to me?
How could he have?
When?
I'm one of his ghosts, and he wouldn't even know it.
- I don't know what that means.
- Ask your saint who he is.
Ask him who he's killed.
Please, don't creep around this house.
See, I don't think he's forgotten anything!
I think he wants to forget!
Gentlemen, to mapmaking.
To mapmaking!
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund-raising heroics, we'd still be kicking our heels.
- To arm-twisting.
- Arm-twisting.
Did Katharine say Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo?
Return the favor.
Take a few photographs for the army.
Oh, um, what kind of photographs?
Portraits.
The brigadier, the brigadier's wife, the brigadier's dog, brigadier by the pyramids, brigadier breathing.
And I shall, of course, be bereft.
I'll finally be able to explore the Cairo nightlife.
I shall produce an authoritative guide to the zinc bars and--
I want to say hareems. 
Are we in the right country for hareems?
Harems.
- Bye, my love.
- Keep safe.
Catch up in a week.
Clifton, safe journey.
You too. Good luck.
Glad the funds have turned up.
Clifton.
This is probably none of my business.
Your wife.
- Think it's appropriate to leave her?
- Appropriate?
Well, the desert is, it's, uh-- for a woman, it's very tough.
I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.
She told me yesterday.
- All the same, were I you--
- I've known Katharine since she was three.
We were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.
I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.
I think she'd know herself.
Very well.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?
I have come to love... that little tap of the fingernail against the syringe.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
Stop playing! Please, stop playing.
I don't have the key to that door. You--
The Germans were here.
The Germans were all over this area.
They left mines everywhere.
And pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I see.
Sorry.
Then maybe you're safe as long as you only play Bach.
He's German.
Is something funny?
No. I'm sorry.
I've met you before.
I don't think so.
Look. See?
Move that, and no more Bach.
Lieutenant!
Are you all right, sir?
Fine, Sergeant.
So you're working with the Italians.
Yeah, trying to get them to give up their weapons.
I was a thief, so the army thought I'd be good at it.
I like the Italians.
He wants us to move out.
He says there could be 50 more mines in the building.
He thinks I'm mad because I laugh at him.
He's Indian.
- He wears a turban.
- No, he's Sikh.
If he wears a turban, he's Sikh.
I'll probably marry him.
Really?
That's sudden.
My mother always told me...
I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
- I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
- Why? Is he staying?
With his sergeant, a Mr. Hardy.
We should charge.
Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
They have to clear all the roads of mines. 
That's a big job.
In that case, 
I-- I suppose we can't charge.
No, we can't.
Thank you.

I've been thinking. How does someone like you decide to come to the desert?
What is it? You--
You're doing whatever you're doing in your castle, or wherever it is you live, and one day you say,
"I have to get to the desert", or what?
I once traveled with a guide who was taking me to Faya.
He didn't speak for nine hours.
At the end of it, he pointed at the horizon and said, "Faya".
That was a good day.
Actually, you sing.
- What?
- You sing.
All the time.
- I do not.
- Ask Al Auf.
Al Auf!
You'd better be ready about half past 8:00
Remember, honey
Don't be late
'Cause I'll be there when the band starts playing
Gonna dance off both my shoes
When they play the Jelly Roll blues
Tomorrow night at the dark-town strutter's ball
Give me your hand.
Thanks.
Madox!
Madox!
Madox!
- Come quickly! I've found something!
- What is it?
D'Ag! Bermann!
Quick!
My God.
They're swimming.
They're swimming.
Ow!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
How do you explain... to someone who has never been here, feelings which seem quite normal?
I don't know, my friend.
I don't know.
- Aaah!
- Kamal!
Bermann, what are you doing?
Bermann!
Watch out!
Watch out!
- Get them out of the car!
- Let me help!
Almasy, are you all right?
Yes, yes, I'm fine.
My wrist!
Ah!
I'll be back as quick as I can,
36 hours at the outside.
Try to get an additional radiator.
We can store it between here and Pottery Hill. 
And a better jack.
- We planned badly.
- Bermann?
Safe journey.
Now what?
Let's get all this stuff off.
- I'll stay behind, of course.
- Certainly not.
- I caused the problem. I shall stay.
- You can't. None of you can.
No, I insist. 
There clearly isn't room for all of us.
I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded.
It's only one night.
If I remain, it's the most effective method of persuading my husband... to abandon whatever he's doing and come and rescue us.
- All right.
- Come on, let's get going.
I thought you might like to paste them into your book.
Well, we--
We took photographs.
There's no need.
No, really.
I'd like you to have them.
Well, there's really no need.
This is, um--
This is just a scrapbook.
They are too good.
I should feel obliged.
Thank you.
And that would be unconscionable,
I suppose, wouldn't it?
To feel any obligation.
Yes, of course it would.
You should come into the shelter.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
- Look over there.
- What am I looking at?
Do you see what's happening to them, the stars?
- They're so untidy. I was trying to rearrange them.
- No, no.
Over there.
In a few minutes, there'll be no stars.
The air is filling with sand.
- This is not very good, is it?
- No.
- Will we be all right?
- Yes.
Yes.
Absolutely.
"Yes" is a comfort.
"Absolutely" is not.
Let me tell you about winds.
There is a, a whirlwind from southern Morocco, the Aajej, against which the Fellahin defend themselves with knives.
And there is a, a Ghibli from Tunis.
- A Ghibli?
- A Ghibli.
Which rolls and rolls and rolls and produces a-- a rather strange nervous condition.
And then there is the, the Harmatten, a red wind, which mariners call
"the sea of darkness".
And red sand from this wind... has flown as far as the south coast of England, apparently producing... showers so dense that they were mistaken for blood.
Fiction!
We have a house on that coast and it has never, never rained blood.
No, it's all true.
Herodotus, your friend.
- My friend.
- Your fri--
He writes about it... and he writes about... a, a wind, the Simoon, which a nation thought was so evil, they declared war on it and marched out against it.
In full battle dress.
Their swords raised.
Katharine, Katharine, 
I need to get out your side, quickly.
A car!
Let me out!
Of course.
I'm sorry.
Ridiculous to fall asleep!
Unforgivable!
Damn!
The flare!
Stop!
Over here!
Here!
Stop!
Madox!
Madox! Madox!
Our tracks have disappeared.
Madox will calculate how many miles.
He'll soon turn around.
Could I ask you, please, to... paste your paintings into my book.
I-- I should like to have them.
I should be honored.
The others!
- Oh, God.
- Quick!
Oh, how awful!
We've got to get them out.
Quick!
Get the other shovel!
Am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have left?
A little in our can. We have, uh, water in the radiator, which can be drunk.
And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.
It's extremely practical.
We, uh-- Oh, come on!
Come on!
There's also a plant.
I've never seen it, but I believe you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant, and the next morning it'll be filled with a delicious liquid.
Find that plant, cut out its heart.
Here.
Here's the window.
Clear the glass. I'll clear the door.
Mind your hands.
It's okay. We're here.
Come on, clear it quickly.
Hang on.
Coming.
- I've got it. I've got it.
- Help them out. Here.
Katharine.
Water.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.
He's not actually a buffoon.
The plane wasn't a wedding present.
It belongs to the British government.
They want aerial maps of the whole of North Africa.
So I think he's in Ethiopia.
In case you're counting on his sudden appearance.
And the marriage.
Is that a fiction?
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.
Madox.
It's Madox.
Am I K in your book?
I think I must be.
Chapter one.
"He sat in defiance of municipal orders astride the gun Zamzammah--"
I can't read these words. I can't read them. 
They stick in my throat.
Because you're reading it too fast.
- Not at all.
- You have to read Kipling slowly.
Your eye is too impatient.
Think about the speed of his pen.
What is it?
"He sat, comma,
"in defiance of municipal orders, comma,
"astride the gun Zamzammah... on her brick--"
What is it?
"Brick platform, opposite the old Ajaib-Gher."
"The wonder house, comma, as the natives called the Lahore Museum."
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum.
Made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down.
Then later, they fired the cannon at my people, comma, the natives.
Full stop.
What exactly is it you object to?
The writer, or what he's writing about?
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.
And the message everywhere in your book, however slowly I read it, that the best thing for India is to be ruled by the British.
Hana, we have discovered a shared pleasure, the boy and I.
- Arguing about books?
- Condensed milk.
One of the truly great inventions.
I'll get another tin.
I didn't like that book either.
It's all about men.
Too many men.
Just like this house.
You like him, don't you?
Your voice changes.
No, I don't think it does.
Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
I don't think it's indifference.
- Hana was just telling me, you're indifferent...
- Hey! to her cooking.
Well, I'm indifferent to cooking.
Not Hana's cooking in particular.
Have either of you tried condensed milk sandwiches?
They're very good with salt.
Welcome back, Madam.
Will you not come in?
No.
- I should go home.
- Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton.
Don't.
I believe you still have my book.
Thank you.
You still have sand in your hair.
It wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me
Without your love
I'm impressed you can sew.
Good.
You sew very badly.
Well, you don't sew at all.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can, she shouldn't admit to it.
Close your eyes.
It makes it harder still.
Hmm.
When were you most happy?
Now.
And when were you least happy?
Now.
- What do you love?
- What do I love?
- Say everything.
- Let's see.
- Water.
- Mm-hmm.
Fish in it.
And hedgehogs.
I love hedgehogs.
And what else?
Marmite.
I'm addicted.
And baths.
But not with other people.
Islands.
And your handwriting.
- Mmm.
- I could go on all day.
Go on all day.
My husband.
And what do you hate most?
A lie.
What do you hate most?
Ownership.
Being owned.
When you leave, you should forget me.
- Who is this?
- Don't you recognize me?
Is it you? So fat.
- Hmm.
- That's a Christmas cracker.
Firecracker.
- This isn't your handwriting, is it?
- Yes, it is.
"December 22nd.
"Betrayals in war are childlike...
"compared with our betrayals during peace.
"New lovers are nervous and tender...
"but smash everything.
For the heart is an organ of fire."
"For the heart is an organ of fire."
I love that.
I believe that.
K?
- Who is K?
- K... is for Katharine.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
- Say you're sick.
- What? No.
Say you're feeling faint.
The heat.
- No.
- I can't work.
- I can't sleep.
- Katharine.
Coming.
I can't sleep. I wake up shouting in the middle of the night.
- Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, trauma.
- I can still taste you.
- Fill up this. It's empty.
- Oh.
I try to write, with your taste in my mouth.
Swoon.
They'll catch you.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
- Come along with me now!
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
Merry Christmas!
- Katharine! Oh, my goodness!
- Oh.
Fetch a chair.
No, I'm fine.
- It's this heat. It's terrible.
- Is she all right?
- She's quite all right.
- Oh, good.
- Are you pregnant?
- Oh, I don't think so, no.
How romantic.
With Fiona, I fell over every five minutes.
Ronnie christened me "Lady Downfall."
Do you know, I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
- I'll come with you.
- No, I'll be all right. You stay here.
Are you sure?
Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin
And her child
Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Sleep in heavenly peace
Happy Christmas!
God save our gracious king
- Have you seen Katharine?
- What?
- It's Clifton under here.
- Oh.
No, I haven't. Sorry.
Send him victorious
Darling, I just heard.
You poor sausage.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just too hot.
Lady H thought you might be pregnant.
I'm not pregnant. I'm just hot.
Too hot, like you.
I'm sweltering, in fact.
Come on, I'll take you home.
Can we really go home?
I can't breathe.
I am dying for green.
Anything green, or rain.
It's Christmas and it's all--
Oh, I don't know.
If you asked me, I'd go home tomorrow.
If you wanted.
Darling, you know we can't go home.
There might be a war.
Oh, Geoffrey, you do so love a disguise.
I do so love you.
Mmm.
- What do you smell of?
- What?
Marzipan. I think you've got marzipan in your hair.
No wonder you're homesick.
Is it you?
What?
If I said "Moose"--
Moose?
Who the hell's Moose?
I look different.
Why shouldn't you?
I heard your breathing.
I thought it was the rain.
I'm dying for rain.
Well, I'm dying anyway, but I--
I long for the rain on my face.
First wedding anniversary, what do you call it?
Ha, I don't know.
Paper?
Is it?
I don't know.
Paper.
Paper?
Darling, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry, something's come up.
- Oh, no.
- Now don't sulk. I'll be back tomorrow evening.
I'm going to sulk, and I'm not moving till you get back here.
Promise?
That's good.
Okay, my sausage, I love you.
- I didn't know you were going anywhere.
- I'm not.
I'm going to surprise her. It's our anniversary. 
She's forgotten, of course.
What's the symbol of your first anniversary? 
I should get something.
Is it cotton or paper?
Your first anniversary? I thought you two'd been married for donkey's years.
We've been friends for donkey's years.
Best friends.
She was always crying on my shoulder about somebody.
I finally persuaded her to settle for my shoulder. 
A stroke of genius.
- Moose, are you there?
- Yes.
- First anniversary. Is that cotton?
- Uh, is what cotton?
First wedding anniversary.
Your first anniversary is... paper.
- Stop.
- Please?
S-- Stop here.
- Here?
- Just stop right here.
Yes, sir.
This--
What is this?
It's a folk song.
- Arabic.
- No, no, it's Hungarian.
My daijka sang it to me.
When I was a child growing up in Budapest.
It's beautiful.
Hmm.
What's it about?
Szerelem means love.
And the story--
Well, there's, um, this Hungarian count.
He's a wanderer.
He's a fool.
And for years he's on some kind of a quest for... who knows what.
And then one day, he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman, a harpy, who beats him and hits him.
And he becomes her slave and he sews her clothes and worships--
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop! You're always beating me.
Bastard.
You bastard!
I believed you!
You should be my slave.
I claim this shoulder blade--
No, wait. No, I want--
Turn over.
I want this, this-- this place.
I love this place.
What's it called?
This is mine.
I'm going to ask the king permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorus.
I thought we were against ownership.
I can stay tonight.
Madox knows, I think.
He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.
I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.
Well, it's my idea of a man-to-man chat.
This is a different world, is what I tell myself.
A different life.
And here I'm a different wife.
Yes.
Here you are a different wife.
Oh, they're darling.
What are they? Thimbles?
Yes, and they're quite old.
It's full of saffron.
Just in case you think I'm going to give it to you to encourage your sewing.
I don't care to bargain.
That day, did you follow me to the market?
Yes, of course.
Shall we be all right?
Yes.
Yes.
Absolutely.
Oh, dear.
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh, I love to go out fishing
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through to heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're off together dancing cheek to cheek
- Thought you'd never wake up.
- What?
- Where did you find that?
- I liberated it.
- I think that's called looting.
- No one should own music. The real question is:
- Who wrote the song?
- Irving Berlin.
- For?
- Top Hat.
Is there a song you don't know?
Nope. He sings all the time.
Good morning. Did you know that?
You're always singing.
I've been told before.
Kip's another one.
"Wang Wang Blues."
You're incredible.
- Good mornin', Miss.
- Hello.
You saved my life.
I haven't forgotten.
I thought you were very, very tall.
You seemed so big and... giant.
I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
- A toddler.
- A toddler.
My hair was long at some point.
I've forgotten what a nuisance it is to wash.
Try this. I found a great jar of it.
Olive oil.
Thank you.
Is this for my hair?
Yes, for your hair.
There was a general who wore a patch... over a perfectly good eye.
The men fought harder for him.
Sometimes I think
I could get up and dance.
What's under your mittens?
What's under your mittens?
He's waiting for you.
I'll see you tonight?
Look, Moose, we need you to stay in Tobruk.
I know it's a bit of a short straw, but Jerry's got our maps, you know.
And now they're getting their spies into Cairo using our maps.
They'll get Rommel into Cairo using our maps.
The whole of the desert's like a bloody bus route, and we gave it to 'em!
Any foreigner who turned up:
"Welcome to the Royal Geographic.
Take our maps."
Old Madox went mad, you know.
- Did you know Peter Madox?
- Yeah.
Magnificent explorer.
Thanks, Aicha.
And after he found out he'd been betrayed by Almasy.
His best friend.
Absolutely destroyed the poor sot.
Hey, Commandant, stay in line!
Hello, little Tommy.
Little baby, hello.
- Recognize him? British friend?
- No.
Aaah!
- Get up!
- No!
Get up at once!
No, I don't have a boyfriend.
I don't know anybody!
Halt!
No! No!
David Caravaggio.
- No.
- This was taken in Cairo at British headquarters.
July '41.
And so was this.
August '41.
And this.
February '42.
It's possible.
I was buying or selling something.
I've been to Cairo many times.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.
Code name: Moose.
Can you get me a doctor?
I'm sick.
I'm leaking blood!
You want a doctor?
I've been askin' for weeks, months--
We don't have a doctor.
But we do have a nurse.
Sure, great.
A nurse would be great.
Look, give me something.
A name, a code.
So we can all get out of this room.
I can't think in this heat.
- It's too hot.
- I slept with a girl.
I've got a wife in Tripoli.
A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Fire!
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
This is your nurse, by the way.
She's Muslim, so she'll understand all of this.
What's the punishment for adultery?
Let's leave it at that.
You're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's, uh--
Is it the hands that are cut off?
Or is that for stealing?
Does anyone know?
Well, you must know.
You were brought up in Libya, yes?
- Don't cut me.
- Or was it Toronto?
Ten fingers.
How about this?
You give me a name for every finger.
It doesn't matter who.
I get something, you keep something.
- I'm trying to be reasonable.
- Don't cut me. Come on!
Are thumbs fingers?
- I get no help from these people.
- Telephone.
I'm sick of this room, 
I'm sick of this heat and I'm sick of this phone!
Ah! The Geneva Convention!
Hey, come on!
You can't do that!
- Come over here.
- I'll give you names.
- You!
- I'll give you names!
- Come on!
- What names did you say?
Aaah! Aaah! Let me think!
Just let me think!
I can't think! I know them!
Please, let me think!
I promise!
Oh, please, please, no!
- What name did you say? I knew them!
- Come on!
- I can't think of any names! Not my hands! Oh, dear God!
- What are you waiting for?
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, no!
I promise!
Oh, please, not my hands!
No! Jesus!
Jesus! Oh, dear God!
- Please don't cut me!
- Come on!
Aaah!
No!
Please don't cut!
Don't!
The man who took my thumbs?
I found him eventually.
I killed him.
The man who took my photograph?
I found him too.
That took me a year.
He's dead.
Another man showed the Germans... a way to get their spies into Cairo.
I've been looking for him.
You can't get through there.
It's impossible.
I was looking again at Bell's old maps.
If we can find a way through the Wadi,
we can drive straight into Cairo.
- This whole spur is a real possibility.
- So on Thursday, you don't trust Bell's map, Bell was a fool, 
Bell couldn't draw a map.
But on Friday, he's suddenly infallible.
- And where are the expedition maps?
- In my room.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.
They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Harry to have sight of.
What on earth's the matter with you?
Don't be so bloody naive!
You know there's a war breaking out!
This arrived this morning.
"By order of the British Government, all international expeditions to be aborted by May, 1939."
What do they care about our maps?
What do we find in the desert?
Arrowheads, spears.
In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Own the desert?
Ha!
Um, Madox?
That place--
That place at the base of a woman's throat.
You know, the hollow here.
Does it have an official name?
For God's sake, man, pull yourself together.
Nowhere is there any wild patriotic excitement,
but everywhere there is a deep hatred of war.
The answer lies with one man,
and the solid mass of the crowd surging round his car...
are a symbol that the British people are more firmly of one mind today...
than at any other time in our history.
There's a great to-do in Sandown Bay,
with rowing and sailing, and no end of sport for every water baby.
Sorry.
I can't--
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I can't do this anymore.
I'd better go now.
Say goodbye here.
I'm not agreeing. 
Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Any minute now, he'll find out.
We'll barge into someone.
It'll kill him.
Don't go over it again, please.
Katharine?
I--
I just want you to know I'm--
I'm not missing you yet.
You will.
You will.
I believe I'm rather late.
Good.
We're all here.
A toast to the International Sand Club.
May it soon resurface.
The International Sand Club.
The International Sand Club: misfits, buggers, fascists and fools.
God bless us, every one.
Oops!
Mustn't say "International".
Dirty word, filthy word.
His Majesty, die Fuhrer, il Duce--
Sorry.
What's your point?
And the people here don't want us.
You must be joking.
Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the colonials. 
Isn't that right, Fouad?
Some of their best people getting down on their hands and knees, begging to be spared the Knighthood.
Isn't that right? Hmm?
Isn't that right, Sir Ronnie?
What's my point?
Oh, I've invented a new dance.
Anybody up for it?
It's called--
It's called the Bosphorus Hug.
Madox?
Bermann?
You'll dance with me? Hmm?
D'Ag.
Come on, Daggers.
Let's eat first.
Sit down.
We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in your bathing suit so thin
We'll make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin
They're playing it far too slowly, but these were the words, actually, before they were cleaned up.
Might be a song for you, Mrs. Clif--
You either shut up or go home! 
You're completely blasted!
- Sit down!
- Absolutely right! Shut up! Shut up!
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I can't think what came over me.
Lashings of apologies... all around.
Thank you.
- Why were you holding his collar?
- What?
"What"? That boy.
That little boy.
You were holding his collar.
You were gripping his collar. What for?
Hmm?
Is he next?
Are you going to drag him into your little room? Where is it?
Is this it?
- Don't do this.
- I've watched you.
I've watched you at garden parties, on verandas, at the races.
- How can you... stand there?
- Please.
How can you ever smile, as if your life hadn't capsized?
You know why?
Dance with me.
No.
Dance with me.
I want to touch you.
I want the things which are mine, which belong to me.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?
Is that what you think?
Why don't you go?
- Get some sleep.
- Would you like me to?
Good night.
Hana.
Kip.
Just wait.
Don't look at anything yet.
Wait.
Kip!
Oh, thank you!
Mmm!
If one night I didn't come to see you, what would you do?
I try not to expect you.
Yes, but if it got late and...
I hadn't shown up?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
You wouldn't come to find me?
Hmm. That makes me never want to come here.
Then I'd tell myself, he spends all day searching.
In the night, he wants to be found.
I do. I do want you to find me.
I do want to be found.
I was looking for Lieutenant Singh.
- He's sleeping.
- Only we've got to go to work.
I'll tell him.
What is it?
Is it a mine?
It's a bomb by a viaduct.
- Does he have to go?
- Beg pardon?
What if you couldn't find him?
Sergeant, not today. Not this morning.
- What's happening? Am I needed?
- Afraid so, sir.
Don't go.
I'm frightened.
This is what I do.
I do this every day.
Hardy!
Serial number K-K-I-P...
K-K-I-P2600, sir!
I'll get the oxygen.
Hardy, what's happening?
Can't see, sir!
It's from the road!
Corporal?
Tanks, sir!
I don't know what it's about!
- Stop 'em!
- Stop!
Stop!
- Hardy!
- Stop! Stop!
What is this, a bloody carnival?
The fuse has snapped!
What's happened? Is it armed?
Hang on a second.
I'll be right with you.
Can you see the detonator, sir?
You've got to cut it, sir.
That frost won't last.
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!
- Go away!
- Yes, sir.
- This is making me incredibly angry.
- I know, sir.
Watch out!
That'll burn!
Ow!
Can you feel 'em?
Cut it, sir.
- You've gotta cut it!
- I don't even know if this is the right wire.
Choose. Just choose a loop and cut it.
Get a blanket! Spaulding, get a blanket for Lieutenant!
Sarge! Sarge!
It's over, sir! It's over!
- Jerry's surrendered!
- Yeah-ha!
Sir, congratulations.
Heaven
I'm in heaven
Kip? Kip?
Kip!
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
Hey, we're goin' home!
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
It's raining.
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Kip, come and dance with us.
- Later.
- Oh, come on.
Clap now.
Yeah.
Come on, Sarge!
Let's raise that flag!
Hardy's coming!
Here comes the bomb squad!
Hey, where's my helmet?
Go on,
Sergeant Hardy!
Bring 'em home!
Hardy! Hardy! Hardy!
What was that?
I'm never going to forgive myself.
I'm never going to bloody forgive myself.
Sergeant Hardy, sir.
It was booby-trapped.
They was runnin' up the Union Jack, sir, up on that statue.
It just went off, sir.
Sergeant Hardy climbed up, Sir, just for a lark, sir.
It should've been me.
It was my idea.
- Sir, you don't wanna look.
- Ooh.
Who's that girl?
His fiancee, sir.
- Hardy's?
- He kept it a bit dark.
Kip?
Kip, it's me.
I'm so sorry about what happened.
Can I talk to you?
Kip?
Kip, why won't you talk to me?
Oh, Kip.
Oh, let me come in!
Hana tells me you're leaving.
There's going to be trials.
They want me to interpret.
Don't they know 
I'm allergic to courtrooms?
So...
I come across the hospital convoy.
They're looking for this stuff.
This nurse, Mary,
tells me about you and Hana...
hiding in some monastery in--
What do you call it?
Retreat?
How you came out of the desert... and you were burned and you didn't remember your name, but you knew the words to every song that ever was... and you had one possession: a copy of Herodotus.
And it was filled... with letters and cuttings.
Then I knew it was you.
Me?
I saw you...
writing in that book at the embassy in Cairo... when I had thumbs and you had a face... and a name.
I see.
Before you went over to the Germans,
before you found a way to get Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters.
He took some pretty good photographs.
I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk.
So, it made an impression.
I had to get back to the desert.
I'd made a promise.
The rest meant nothing to me.
What did you say?
That the rest... meant nothing to me.
There was a result to what you did.
It wasn't just another expedition.
It did this.
If the British hadn't unearthed that photographer,
thousands of people could have died.
Thousands of people did die.
Just different people.
- Yes, like Madox.
- What?
You know he shot himself, your partner,
- when he found out you were a spy.
- What?
Madox thought I was a spy? No.
No, I was never a spy.
It's ghastly.
It's like a witch hunt.
Anybody remotely foreign is suddenly a spy.
- So watch out.
- Right.
We didn't care about countries, did we?
Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans--
None of that mattered, did it?
It was something finer than that.
Yes, it was.
I'll leave the plane in Kufra oasis.
- So, if you need it--
- Right.
Hard to know how long one's talking about.
We might all be back in a month or two.
Hmm.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.
It comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Good-bye, my friend.
There is no God.
But I hope someone looks after you.
In case you're still wondering, this is called a suprasternal notch.
Come and visit us in Dorset when all this nonsense is over.
You'll never come to Dorset.
So, you didn't know Madox shot himself.
No.
And you didn't kill the Cliftons?
Sh--
She--
She die--
She--
I can't.
Well... maybe I did.
Maybe I did.
I was packing up our base camp...
at the Cave of Swimmers.
Clifton had offered to fly down from Cairo to collect me.
He flew like a madman always,
so I-- I took no notice.
Aaah!
Katharine?
Dear God, Katharine, what are you doing here?
I can't get out.
I can't move.
"Surprise", he said.
Poor Geoffrey.
He knew. 
He must've known all the time.
He was shouting, "I love you, Katharine.
I love you so much."
Is he badly hurt?
I have to get you out.
- Please don't move me.
- I have to get you out.
- It hurts too much.
- I know, darling, I know. I'm sorry.
Come on.
Now!
Why did you hate me?
What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Shh.
Don't talk.
You speak so many bloody languages... and you never want to talk.
- You're wearing the thimble.
- Of course.
You idiot.
I always wear it.
I've always worn it.
I've always loved you.
It's so cold.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'll make a fire.
Did you get Geoffrey out of the plane?
- Yes, I did.
- Good. That's good. Thank you.
Listen to me, Katharine.
You've broken your ankle... and I'm going to have to try and bind it.
I think you've also broken your wrist... and maybe some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.
I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.
Although, given all the traffic in the desert these days,
I'm bound to bump into one army or another.
And then I'll come back and you'll be fine.
You promise?
I wouldn't want to die here.
I don't want to die in the desert.
I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind.
Particular hymns.
And I know exactly where I want to be buried.
In our garden, where I grew up... with a view of the sea.
So promise me you'll come back for me.
I promise...
I'll come back for you.
I promise...
I'll never leave you.
You have plenty of water... and, um, food.
I'll open them for you.
A good read.
Don't waste this.
Will you bury Geoffrey?
I know he's dead.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
I know.
Every night...
I cut out my heart.
But in the morning it was full again.
Darling.
My darling.
You'd better be ready about half past 8:00
Now, honey
Don't you be late
I'm going to be there when the band starts playing
Remember
When we get there, honey
An invitation to the strutter's ball
A very swell affair
All the highbrows will be there
I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey
I stopped at noon and at twilight.
Three days there on foot,
I told her,
and three hours back by car.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.
Just walked in from the desert, sir.
Morning.
Dear golly, where have you come from then?
There's been an accident.
I need a doctor... to come with me, and I need to borrow this car.
I'll pay, of course.
- And I need-- I need morphine.
- May I see your papers, sir?
What?
If I could just see some form of identification.
I'm sorry, I'm not making sense.
Forgive me, I-- I'm not--
I've been walking and--
A woman is badly injured at the Gilf Kabir, the Cave of Swimmers.
I'm a member of the 
Royal Geographical Society.
Right.
Now, if I could... just take your name.
Count Laszlo de Almasy.
"Almasy." 
Would you mind spelling that for me?
- Look, listen to me, will you?
- What nationality would that be?
A woman is dying.
My wife is dying.
I have been... walking--
I have been walking for three days.
I do not want to spell my name.
- I want you to give me this car.
- I understand you're agitated.
Perhaps if you'd like to sit down,
I can radio back to H.Q.
No. No, don't--
Don't radio anybody!
Just give me the fucking car!
Stop the car, please.
A woman is dying!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you,
I'm going to give you a fucking good hiding!
Fritz? 
What are you talking about, Fritz?
Well, that's your name, isn't it?
Count Fuckin' Asshole Von Bismarck!
- What's that supposed to be, Irish?
- Please!
You have to listen!
Katharine!
Katharine!
Excuse me.
- I also need to use the lavatory.
- You'll have to wait.
- It's urgent.
- Sarge!
Sarge, Jerry wants to use the lav.
Says it's urgent.
- Where are we going, please?
- Oh, up north to the coast.
Benghazi.
Soon be there.
You can get your boat back home then.
All right, go on then.
Here, you take him.
I've been up and down this bloody train all day.
It doesn't open.
Aaah!
So yes, she died because of me.
Because I loved her.
Because I--
Because I had the wrong name.
- And you never got back to the cave?
- I did get back.
I kept my promise.
I was assisted by the Germans.
There was a-- a trade.
I had our expedition maps.
And after the British made me their enemy,
I gave their enemy our maps.
So I got back to the desert...
and to Katharine...
in Madox's English plane...
with German gasoline.
When I arrived in Italy, on my medical chart they wrote,
"English Patient."
Isn't that funny?
After all that, I became English.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it?
Black nights.
- I thought I would kill you.
- You can't kill me.
I died years ago.
No, I can't kill you now.
We've been posted.
North of Florence.
I was thinking yesterday-- yesterday--
The patient and Hardy.
They're everything that's good about England.
I couldn't even say what that was.
We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things.
Some terrible things.
He was engaged to a girl in the village.
I mean--
And us, he never once--
He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or Kamasutra or--
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
You loved him.
Katharine.
I'm still here.
You'd better be.
Don't depend on it, will you?
That little bit of air in my lungs, each day it gets less and less.
Which is all right.
It's quite all right.
I've been speaking to Caravaggio, my research assistant.
He tells me there's a ghost in the cloisters.
I can join him.
- Hana!
- It's the boy.
I'll always go back to that church.
Look at my paintings.
I'll always go back to that church.
So one day we'll meet.
Thank you.
Read to me, will you?
Read me to sleep.
"My darling,
"I'm waiting for you.
"How long is a day in the dark?
"Or a week?
"The fire is gone now... and I'm horr-- horribly cold."
I really ought to drag myself outside,
but then there'd be the sun.
I'm afraid I waste the light...
on the paintings and on writing these words.
We die.
"We die.
"We die rich with lovers and tribes,
"tastes we have swallowed,
"bodies we have entered... and swum up like rivers."
Fears we've hidden in,
like this wretched cave.
I want all this marked on my body.
We're the real countries.
Not the boundaries drawn on maps,
the names of powerful men.
I know you'll come and carry me out into the palace of winds.
That's all I've wanted,
to walk in such a place with you,
with friends.
An Earth without maps.
"The lamp's gone out,
"and I'm writing... in the darkness."
Hana?
Hana, come on!
Hana... this is Gioia.
- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno.
She'll take you as far as Florence.
I can get in back.

I have an excellent German Riesling.

There's a company you did the books for on Lipowa Street.
Made what?
Pots and pans?
By law, I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew.
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.
A good company, you think?
Modestly successful.
I know nothing about enamelware. Do you?
I was just the accountant.
Simple engineering though, wouldn't you think?
Change the machines around, whatever you do...
You could make other things, couldn't you?
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great.
You can make a fortune, don't you think?
I think most people right now have other priorities.

I'm sure you'll do just fine once you get the contracts.
In fact, the worse things get, the better you'll do.
Well, I can get the signatures I need.
That's the easy part.
Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
You don't have any money?
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?
Jews, yeah. Investors.
You must have contacts in the Jewish business community, working here.
What community? Jews can no longer own businesses.
That's why this one's in receivership.
But they wouldn't own it.
I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product, pots and pans.
Pots and pans.
Something they can use.
Something they can feel in their hands.
They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want.
Everybody's happy.
If you want, you could run the company for me.
Let me understand.
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.
What, if you don't mind my asking, would you do?
I'd make sure it's known the company's in business.
I'd see that it had a certain panache.
That's what I'm good at, not the work.
Not the work.

Poles you pay wages. Generally, they get a little more.
Are you listening?
What was that about the SS?
The rate? The what?
The Jewish worker's salary.
You pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.
He gets nothing.
But it's less.
It's less than what
I would pay a Pole.
It's less.
That's the point I'm trying to make.
Poles cost more.
Why should I hire Poles?
An enamelware factory over at Lipowa Street.
It's owned by a German.
But it's outside the ghetto, so you can barter for extra goods, for eggs,
I don't know what you need, with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.
Also, he's asking for
10 healthy women for the...
I am healthy.
Bring your sister, okay?
(SHOUTING ORDERS
IN GERMAN AND POLISH)
Chodz.
You need to convince them you have a trade, something valuable to the war effort.
Like what?
What if you don't?
I'm a musician.
Your name goes on a list.
And they put you on trucks...
No, no, that's not true.
You're a musician?
Yeah.
I'd find a good hiding place if I were you.
I'm not going to hide like some animal.
There are places to hide.
Der Nächste!
I'm a graduate of the University of Lviv.
I used to work at the hydroelectric station in Roznów.
MAN: Blauschein.
I'm gonna get the necessary papers because this carol is no good anymore.
You can stay in this line all day, you'll still get one of these.
They are no good. You'll have to leave the line now, then you'll get a blue card, a Blauschein, to say that you are an essential worker.
I'll get these papers for you at Pankiewicz.
Pharmacist. Just there, look.
Guess who is here?
GOLDBERG: Poldek!
Enjoying the weather, Poldek?
Enjoying the lines?
Need some shoe polish?
In a metal container maybe?
Not essential? I think you misunderstand the meaning of the word.
No Blauschein, sir. Stand over there.
Move. Next!
What do you mean,
"Not essential"?
I teach history and literature.
Since when it's not essential?
He's a metal polisher.
It was not right?
It's very good.
He's 53 years old.
It's too new.
Mmm. Thank you.
You're crazy.
You left it in your drawer.
How many times have I told you?
Your work certificate you keep in your pocket at all times.
And you leave yours in your drawer.
How many times I've told you?
I'm a metal polisher.
Take the round sheet of tin, dip it in soap emulsion, then place it centrally in the press.
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot.
Soup pot.
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz, stay together.
Sir,
I have 10 work permits here for the Deutsche
Emailwarenfabrik cosigned by Mr. Bankier and myself.
FOREMAN: if it's carbonized, clean it with a file.
But don't touch both the electrodes at the same time.
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.
Roll the metal under the press, but be very careful unless you want your fingers to become part of the teapot.
Occupation?
I'm a writer.
I play the flute.
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.
He's highly skilled. Give him your card.
Moses, give him your card.
FOREMAN: Now, dip the basin with the tongs into the enamel solution.
And after swiveling it around, carefully place it aside to drip dry.
And whatever he asks you, allow me just to represent you and speak for you.
Don't say a word.
SCHINDLER: Filing, billing, keeping track of my appointments, shorthand.
Typing, obviously.
How is your typing?
Uh, all right.
Please.
You need a secretary.
Pick one.
I don't know how.
They're all so qualified.
You have to choose.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Prosze sie ladnie usmiechac.
 Big smile. Big smile.
Uwaga.
(PLAYING STATELY MUSIC
ON PIANO) if you would, look after my guest.
SCHINDLER: Boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pâté, kielbasa sausage, cheeses, Beluga caviar.
Yes.
And, of course, who could live without German cigarettes?
Get me as many as you can find.
And some more fresh fruit.
The real rarities, oranges, lemons, pineapples.
I need several boxes of Cuban cigars. The best.
Yes. And dark, unsweetened chocolate.
Not in the shape of ladyfingers, the chunk chocolate.
Big as my hand, you sample at wine tastings.
Yes.
We're going to need lots of cognac.
The best, Hennessy.
Dom Pérignon champagne.
Get L'Espadon sardines,
and, oh, try to find nylon stockings.
SCHINDLER: It is my distinct pleasure to announce
the fully operational status of Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik.
FOREMAN: Patrz jakies szmaty!
Manufacturers of superior enamelware crockery,
expressly designed and crafted for military use.
Utilizing only the most modern equipment,
D.E.F.'s staff of highly skilled and
experienced artisans and journeymen
deliver a product of unparalleled quality,
enabling me to proffer, with absolute confidence and pride,
a full line of field and kitchenware
unsurpassable in all respects by my competitors.
See attached list and available colors.
Anticipating the enclosed bids will meet with your approval
and looking forward to a long and mutually prosperous association,
I extend to you in advance my sincerest gratitude
and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.
Yeah, I need 700 gross from here for next Thursday.
Nine hundred, no, make it 10 for Wednesday.
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's factory on
Tuesday of next week.
SCHINDLER: My father was fond of saying,
"You need three things in life,
a good doctor, a forgiving priest, and a clever accountant."
The first two,
I've never had much use for.
But the third...
Just pretend, for Christ's sake.
Is that all?
I'm trying to thank you.
I'm saying
I couldn't have done this without you.
The usual thing would be to acknowledge my gratitude.
It would also, by the way, be the courteous thing.
You're welcome.
Get out of here.
SCHINDLER:
Klonowska, who is it?
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.
You know something?
You would like her.
Oskar, please.
What?
I don't have to like her just because you do.
You would, though.
It doesn't work that way.
You've done well here.
You look wonderful.
Be careful of the step, miss.
Mrs. Schindler, Marek.
It's not a charade, all this?
How could it be a charade?
The clothes, the car, the apartment.
Wait a minute.
Take a guess how many people are on my payroll.
Oskar.
My father, at the height of his success, had 50. I've got 350.
Three hundred and fifty workers on the factory floor, with one purpose.
To make pots and pans?
To make money. For me.
Does anyone ask about me?
Back home? Everybody.
All the time.
Hmm.
They won't soon forget the name
Schindler here, I can tell you that.
"Oskar Schindler," they'll say.
"Everybody remembers him."
"He did something extraordinary."
"He did something no one else did."
"He came here with nothing, a suitcase, and built a bankrupt company into a major manufactory."
"And left with a steamer trunk."
"Two steamer trunks full of money."
"All the riches of the world."
Hmm.
It's comforting to see that nothing's changed.
You're wrong, Emilie.
There's no way I could have known this before, but there was always something missing.
In every business I tried, I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.
Something was missing.
Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it, because you can't create this thing.
And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.
Luck?
War.
Should I stay?
It's a beautiful city.
I asked you if I should stay.
It's up to you.
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman or maitre d' will ever presume
I'm anyone other than
Mrs. Schindler, and I'll stay.
Goodbye, darling.
I could try to read this, or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.
We're doing well?
Yes.
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
The war could end.
What?
There is a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Every day he comes. He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.
Mr. Lowenstein?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
You're welcome. I'm sure you're doing a great job.
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me, but I am essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
That's great.
I work hard for you.
I'm sure you do.
I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great. Thanks.
God bless you, sir.
All right.
You are a good man.
He saved my life.
Yes, he did.
God bless him.
Yeah. Come on.
God bless you.
STERN: I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
 but you're running very late.
This is for the Obersturmbannführer, sir.
And this is for his niece, Greta.
It's her birthday.
Greta as in Garbo.
By the way, don't ever do that to me again.
Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.
Did you happen to notice that that man had one arm?
Did he?
What's his use?
Very useful.
How?
Very useful! Success!
Achrar kach loe nedah...
OFFICER: Besen und Schaufeln werden ausgeladen
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann wird die Straße gereinigt.
We'll be late for work.
CZURDA: You shouldn't think of them as yours, Oskar.
You need to understand that some of the officers here don't give a damn about production.
To them, it's a matter of national priority that Jews be made to shovel snow.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar.
You know it and I know it.
Jews shoveling snow, it's got a ritual significance.
Come with me.
I am an essential worker.
Essential worker?
Yes.
I work for Oskar Schindler.
Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.
A one-armed Jew?
Twice as useless!
Yes, yes.
I lost a day of production, Rolf.
LOWENSTEIN:
I work for Oskar Schindler.
Danka, look at the snow. Look at the snow.
Look at the snow!
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.
File a grievance with the Economic Office.
It's your right.
Would it do any good?
Of course not.
A big shot from the SS Budget and
Construction Office came to lunch, and he told us that to believe the
Jewish skilled worker had a place
in Reich economics was a treasonable idea.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He was a metal press operator.
Quite skilled.
Herr Direktor?
Shit. I don't believe it.
Stern, is that you?
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.
SOLDIER ON PA: Leave your luggage on the platform.

MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: Lassen

Stern?
He's on the list.
He is?
Well, let's find him.
I'm sorry.
You can't have him.
He's on the list. If he were an essential worker he would not be on the list.
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list.
I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.
Tauber.
Hauptscharführer, this gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train.
If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: Achtung, dieser Zug fährt jetzt ab.
Is he on the list?
Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.
Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.
What is your name?
SOLDIER ON PA:
Close and secure all doors.
My name? My name is Kunder.
This train is now leaving.
Kunder.

And what's yours?
Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.
Gentlemen, thank you very much.
I think I can guarantee you you'll both be in Southern Russia before the end of the month. Good day.

He's here!
I apologize.
Stop the train!
Stop the train! Stop it!
Sign here.
Initial there.
Makes no difference to us, you understand.
This one, that one.
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) It's the inconvenience to the list.
It's the paperwork.
I somehow left my work card at home.
I tried to explain them it was a mistake, but...
I'm sorry, it was stupid!
What if I got here five minutes later?
Then where would I be?
Sacrean, sacrean end tzukeer.
Tzukeer end sacrean.
I woke up from a dream this morning.
I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know, only to discover I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.
(CHUCKLING) You laugh about it?
I have to laugh.
You are living behind walls.
The walls I can deal with. It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.
I like it here. There's a kind of, I don't know, ancestral squalor to it all.
You are a slave to these people.
No one envies us anymore.
I'm smart.
Oh, yes, you're smart.
You're a real genius.
You had your chance.
Today, today I actually found time to organize a thought.
I can't remember the last time I did that.
When's the last time we did this?
When's the last time we stood around and talked?
No one ordered me onto a truck today.
No one took my business away from me.
You don't really have a business to take.
There's nowhere down from here.
This is it.
This is the bottom.
The ghetto is liberty.
This street divides the ghetto just about in half.
Right side, Ghetto A, civil employees, industrial workers, and so on.
Left side,
Ghetto B, surplus labor, the elderly and infirm, mostly.
Which is where you will want to start.
Do you have any questions, sir?
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.
KUNDE: We expect a labor force of 25,000 to 30,000.
Segregated, of course. The men in the barracks near the quarry.
The women on the other side of the wire.
GOETH: My place is where?
There, sir.
There?
Yes, the villa.
You call that a villa?
Their synagogue, can you see it?
That's not a villa.
We're planning to turn it into the camp stables.
It's a house.
GOETH: What's that over there?
KUNDE: Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.
And we have a dentist, shoemaker, practical physicians.
There they are, sir.
(SNIFFS) Hmm.
One of you is a very lucky girl.
There is an opening for a job away from all this backbreaking work at my new villa.
Uh...
Which of you has domestic experience?
Ja, on second thought, I don't really want someone else's maid.
All those annoying habits I have to undo.
(CHUCKLES) I don't want to give you my cold.
What's your name?
Helen Hirsch.
What?
Helen Hirsch.
What? I can't hear.
Helen Hirsch.
Ja.
WOMAN: Take it all down!
OFFICER: To work!
WOMAN: Take it down!
It is not safe!
She says the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.
I told her it's the barracks, not the fucking Hotel Europa.
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation has to be torn down and re-poured.
If not, there will be at least a subsidence at the southern end of the barracks.
Subsidence, and then collapse.
And you are an engineer?
Yes.
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate of civil engineering from the University of Milan.
An educated Jew, like Karl Marx himself.
Unterscharführer!
Jawohl?
Shoot her.
What?
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.
Ja, I'm doing mine.
But, sir, she's foreman of construction.
We are not going to have arguments with these people.
Okay.
No. Shoot her here, on my authority.
It will take more than that.
GOETH: I'm sure you're right.
Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild it.
Like she said.
We have more to see, but we have only one more hour of light.
GOETH: Today is history.
Today will be remembered.
Years from now, the young will ask with wonder about this day.
Today is history, and you are part of it.
Six hundred years ago,
(SINGING MORNING PRAYER) when elsewhere they were footing the blame
for the Black Death,
Kazimierz the Great...
Ke laolam chasedo
...so-called, told the Jews they could come to Krakow.
They came.
Not that fat. No, less.
They trundled their belongings into the city.
Yes, a bit less.
They settled.
They took hold.
They prospered in business, science, education, the arts.
They came here with nothing.
Nothing.
And they flourished.
For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow.
Think about that.
By this evening,
those six centuries are a rumor.
They never happened.
Today is history.

I think we will start with Ghetto B.
SOLDIERS: Hopp, hopp, hopp, hopp!

The right side, yeah.
And then move around.
All right.

by moving inside the wire of

No, no, no. Sit, sit. Julian, how are you?
Good to see you, my friend.
Oskar Schindler.
Leo John.
Franz, good to see you.
Hello, Oskar.
Glad you could join us.
My pleasure. Julius.
How are you?
You lost weight.
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.
We started without you.
Fine. I miss anything good?
I was explaining to Herr Bosch and Herr Madritsch some of the benefits of moving their factories into Plaszow.
I meant the food.
Since your labor is housed on-site, it's available to you at all times.
You can work them all night if you want.
Your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past, they'll continue to be.
They'll be respected.
I have to know, where do you get a suit like that?
What is that? Is that silk?
Of course.
Ja.
It has a nice sheen about it.
Thank you.
Very nice.
I'd say I'd get you one, but the man who made it is probably dead.
I don't know.

I go to work the other day.
Nobody's there.
Nobody tells me about this. I have to find out.
I have to go in.
Everybody's gone.
No. (SIGHS)
No.
They're not gone.
They're here.
They're mine! Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.
Every worker that is shot costs me money.
I have to find somebody else.
I have to train them.
We are going to be making so much money that none of this is going to matter.
It's bad business.
Thank you.
Leave the bottle.
Take that.
Lena, thank you.
Scherner told me something else about you.
Yeah? What's that?
That you know the meaning of the word "gratitude."
That it's not some vague thing with you like it is with others.
You want to stay where you are.
You've got things going on the side.
Things are good.
You don't want anybody telling you what to do.
I can understand all that, you know.
I know you.
What you want is your own sub-camp.
Do you have any idea what is involved?
The paperwork alone, and then you've got to build the fucking thing.
Getting the fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.
Then the engineers show up, they stand around, they argue about drainage, foundations, codes, exact specifications, parallel fences four kilometers long,

Goldberg and Chilowicz, make sure I see my cut from the factory owners in this camp.

He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.
But independence costs money.

Don't let him leave.
(GUESTS CHATTERING
AND LAUGHING)
Was passiert denn in einem Leben
Prost! Prost!
Thank you, Herr Direktor.
Prost, Herr Direktor!
What are you doing?
What? Scratching my head.
Makes them think we have lice. Helps make them keep their distance.
Do you have lice?
Do you have your notebook?
The calendar on my desk has the birthdays of our SS friends' wives and children.
Don't forget to send something.
Record payoffs to the Main Administration and Economics Office, the Arm...
Slowly, Stern, slowly.
The Armaments Board, Governor
General's Division of the Interior and Chief of Police as "fees."
And make them on the first of each month, as opposed to individual payoffs to our SS contacts.
The list is in the lower drawer of my desk, which you...
"First of month..."
SS contacts list, lower drawer of my desk, which you handle as cash contributions to legitimate charities sent, of course, to each official's office.
Dealings with our black market contacts listed as suppliers in the legitimate ledger are more complicated.
Forget it.
What do you mean, forget it?
You can't forget it.
It gives me a headache.
It gives me a headache!
I couldn't get you out of here.
I'll be all right.
Anyway, I'm here almost every week.
Wednesdays, usually.
I'll look in on you, see how you're doing.
Here, put these in your pocket.
Come on.
Herr Direktor, don't let things fall apart.
I've worked too hard.
Thanks for... Good luck.
Achtung, Mützen ab!
Work!
An die Arbeit!
What are you making?
Hinges, sir.
I've got some workers coming in tomorrow.
Where the hell they from again?
Yugoslavia, Herr Kommandant.
I've got to make room.
Make me a hinge.
Yes, sir.
Keep going, you're doing well.
Oh, that's very good.
But I'm a bit confused, and perhaps you can help me.
What I don't understand is that you've been working since I think, what, about 6:00 this morning?
Yet, such a small pile of hinges.
(GUN CLICKS) Oh, Christ.
May I try that, sir?
Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.
No, no. You wouldn't hear a click if it was the angle lever.
Maybe it's the pin.
Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
Ja, come on.
What did I just say? Here.
Herr Kommandant.
I beg to report that my heap of hinges was so unsatisfactory because the machines were being recalibrated this morning.
I was put on to shoveling coal.
Strange, huh?
Yeah.
Thank you, Muek.
Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the leather, it's just been oiled.
Rottenführer.
Oh, for me?
Oh, thank you very much,
Herr Direktor.
STERN: Herr Direktor!
Herr Direktor!
Herr Direktor.
He was making hinges slowly.
So the man can turn out a hinge in less than a minute.
Why the long story?
Hmm?
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
Nobody knows who stole the chicken, hmm?
Tell him about the chicken.
A man walks around with a chicken and nobody notices this.
Save yourselves.
Tell him about the chicken.
Still nobody knows.
It was you.
You committed this crime.
No, sir.
But you know who, though.
Yes.
Who?
Him!
He's very gifted.
Yeah, sure.
Bring him over.
Sir. Thank you.
Thank you again, Herr Direktor.
You're welcome again.
It's an honor to work for such a great company.
It's great to have you.
I promise to learn everything there is to know about enamelware production.
That's great.
Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
I only need five minutes.
She wants to speak to the Herr Direktor.
Yes.
He won't see you.
Please, sit down.
Pernod? Cognac?
No. No, thank you.
So, what can I do for you?
They say that no one dies here.
They say your factory is a haven.
They say you are good.
Who says that?
Everyone.
My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause.
I've been living in Krakow on false papers since the ghetto massacre.
My parents are in Plaszow.
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.
They are older people. They are killing older people now in Plaszow.
They bury them up in the forest. Look,
I don't have any money.
I borrowed these clothes.
I'm begging you. Please.
Please bring them here.
I don't do that.
You've been misled.
I ask one thing.
Whether or not the worker has certain skills.
That's what I ask and that's what I care about.
My father is an importer, not a metalworker.
Such activities are illegal. You will not entrap me! (CONTINUES ARGUING)
Cry, and I will have you arrested.
I swear to God!
People die.
It's a fact of life.
He wants to kill everybody?
Great!
What am I supposed to do about it?
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!
His place is a haven, didn't you know?
It's not a factory.
It's not an enterprise of any kind.
It's a haven for rabbis and orphans and people with no skills whatsoever!
You think I don't know what you're doing?
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!
Are you losing money?
That's not the point!
So the point is?
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!
You have to understand. Goeth is under enormous pressure.
You have to think of it in his situation.
He's got this whole place to run.
He's responsible for everything here, all these people.
He's got a lot of things to worry about.
And he's got the war which brings out the worst in people.
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right.
There'd just be the good aspects of him, which...
He's a wonderful crook.
A man who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
Killing.
He can't enjoy it.
Bejski told me the other day, somebody escaped from a work detail outside the wire.
Goeth lined up everybody from the missing man's barracks.
He shot the man to the left of
Bejski, the man to the right of him.
He walked down the line shooting every other man with a pistol.
Twenty-five.
What do you want me to do about it?
Nothing, nothing.
We're just talking.
"Perlman."
Perlman!
Husband and wife.
Jakob and Chana Perlman!
Have Goldberg bring them over.
SOLDIER: Mützen ab!
Appell abtreten!
(GUESTS SINGING DRUNKENLY
IN GERMAN)
I'm sure this will be better than those rags, Lisiek.
Herr Direktor, I was just helping
Lisiek to find something to clean the stains from the
Herr Kommandant's bathtub.
Go clean it.
Pardon me, Herr Direktor.
You don't have to report to me, Helen.
You know who I am? Hmm?
(WHISPERING) I'm Schindler.
Of course.
I have heard, and you have been here before.
Here, why don't you keep this someplace?
Go on, take it.
I get extra food here.
Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.
Or give it to Lisiek.
Why not build yourself up?
My first day here, he beat me because I threw out the bones from dinner.
He came down to the basement at midnight, and he...
He asked me where they were.
For his dogs, you understand.
I said to him,
I don't know how I say this.
I never could say it now,
I said to him,
"Why are you beating me?"
He said, "The reason
I beat you now is because you ask why I beat you."
I know your sufferings, Helen.
It doesn't matter.
I have accepted them.
Accepted them?
One day he will shoot me.
No, no, no, he won't shoot you.
I know. I see things.
We were on the roof on Monday, young Lisiek and I, and we saw the Herr Kommandant come out of the from door and down the steps by the patio, right there below us, and there on the steps he drew his gun and he shot a woman who was passing by.
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.
Just a woman on her way somewhere, you know?
She was no fatter or thinner or slower or faster than anyone else, and I couldn't guess what had she done.
The more you see of the Herr Kommandant, the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by.
You can't say to yourself, "If I follow these rules, I will be safe."
He won't shoot you because he enjoys you too much.
He enjoys you so much he won't even let you wear the star.
He doesn't want anyone else to know it's a Jew he's enjoying.
He shot the woman from the steps because she meant nothing to him.
She was one of a series, neither offending or pleasing him.
But you, Helen.
It's all right. It's not that kind of a kiss.
Thank you.
Shh.
Here.
Right. The wine.
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.
Why do you drink that motor oil?
Hmm? I send you good stuff all the time.
Your liver's going to explode like a hand grenade.
You know, I look at you.
I watch you.
You're never drunk.
(SNIFFS) Oh, that's...
That's real control.
Control is power.
That's power.
SCHINDLER:
Is that why they fear us?
We have the fucking power to kill, that's why they fear us.
They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily.
A man commits a crime, he should know better.
We have him killed, and we feel pretty good about it.
Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better.
That's not power, though.
That's justice.
It's different than power.
Power is when we have everyjustification to kill, and we don't.
You think that's power?
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy.
He knows he's going to die.
And the emperor pardons him.
This worthless man.
He lets him go.
I think you are drunk.
That's power, Amon.
That is power.
Amon the Good.
I pardon you. (LAUGHS)
GOETH: What do they want?
STERN: I don't know, but they're in my office now reviewing our books.
As my accountant, tell me, should
I be alarmed that the auditors are reviewing my books?
Well...
Or have you done your job properly?
You needn't be alarmed.
I needn't be alarmed.
(GASPS) I'm sorry, sir.
Do you know how much this saddle is worth?
Do you know how much it costs?
All right.
All right.
Stern, what the hell are you doing following me around?
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:

She was smoking on the job.
Tell her not to do it again.
I have to report, sir.
I've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub.
What are you using, Lisiek?
Soap, Commandant.
Soap? Not lye?
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.
I pardon you.
WOMAN: Although I am not a rabbi, in these circumstances
I pray to the Almighty that he will forgive me if I intone the blessings.

Choc bys ja przeklal w rozpaczy

Milosc ci wszystko wybaczy

So...
This is where you come to hide from me.
I came to tell you that you really are a wonderful cook and a well-trained servant.
I mean it, if you need a reference after the war,
I'd be happy to give you one.
It must get lonely down here when you're listening to everyone upstairs having such a good time.
Does it?
You can answer.
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking.
What does he want to hear?
The truth, Helen, is always the right answer.
Yes, you're right.
Sometimes we're both lonely.
Yes. I...
I mean,
I would like so much to reach out and touch you in your loneliness.
What would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...
What would be wrong with that?
I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word, but...
No, maybe you're right about that too, you know, maybe what's wrong isn't...
It's not us.
It's... No, it's this.
I mean, when they compare you to vermin, and to rodents, and to lice...
I just...
No, you make a good point.
You make a very good point.
Is this the face of a rat?
Are these the eyes of a rat?
Hath not a Jew eyes?
Ci wszystko wybaczy
Bo milosc moj mily
I feel for you, Helen.
To ja
No, I don't think so.
You're a Jewish bitch.
You nearly talked me into it, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Bravo.
GUESTS: Hoch!
Hoch! Hoch!
Bravo!
MAN: Bravo!
GUESTS: Hoch!
Hoch! Hoch!
On behalf of the workers, sir,
I wish for you a happy birthday.
Happy birthday
Well, the staff, please.
Thank you very much for the lovely cake.
Thank you very much.
Tell them thank you from me.
To ostatnia niedziela

The trains arrived and the people were driven out with clubs.
They were lined up in front of two big warehouses.
One was marked "Cloak Room," and the other "Valuables."
And there they were made to undress.
A Jewish boy handed them pieces of string to tie their shoes together.
They shaved their hair.
They told them it was needed to make something special for U-boat crews.
And then they were herded down a big corridor to bunkers with Stars of David on the doors and signs that said
"Bath and Inhalation Room."
SS gave them soap.
They told them to breathe all the time because it's good for disinfecting.
And then they gassed them.
Mila, why soaps?
So that they would agree to go in, I think.
Come on, Mila, stop it. Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.
Yeah. You know it's ridiculous.
I cannot believe it.
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.
From who?
From somebody who heard it from someone who was there.
You know, if they were there, they would have been gassed.
Yes.
It doesn't make any sense.
We're their workforce.
What sense does it make to kill your own workforce?
To go to all this trouble of assembling a workforce only to...
No, it can't be true.
We are very, very important for them.
WOMAN 1: Yeah, we do now.
Good night.
WOMAN 2: Good night.
WOMAN 3: Good night.
Sweet dreams.

It's another semi-annual physical.

Find your own hiding place. There's no room for you here. Go away, quick!
Get out.
This is our place. Get out!
Oskar!
Amon. Gentlemen.
Why didn't you call me?
I tried to call you.
Here, Hujar, move.
Quite a picnic, huh?
Madritsch. Oskar.
They're running a little late, you know?
It's taking longer than I thought.
A drink?
Something cold. Bowle.
The Bowle.
Oh, another beautiful day.
Cisza! Spokoj!
Die Beladung der
Transportwagen ist beendet.
Wir sind abfahrbereit.
Wody! Wody!
Wasser... Wasser.
Wohlsein.
Oh, thank you.
What do you say we get your fire hoses out here and hose down the cars?
Thank you.
(CHUCKLES) Indulge me.
GOETH: Hujar.
Yes, sir.
Go bring the fire hoses.
Where's the fire?
SCHINDLER: In the windows.
That's it, that's it.
On the roof. That's it, good, good.
In the window, in the window.
Come on. Come on.
That's it, more, more.
That's it, that's it.
More, more.
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel!
Come on, try and reach the far end. Look out.
MAN: (WAILING)
Water! More water!
I've got some 200-meter hoses back in Emalia.
I have 20 meters at home in my garden.
We can reach the cars at the end.
What? What?
Hujar.
Yeah, sure.
Don't forget the roof.
On the roof on the other side.
Scharführer, every time the train stops you open the doors, you give them water, yeah? Jawohl.
This car! This car!
SCHINDLER: I'm not saying you'll regret it, but you might.
You should be aware of that.
We will have to risk regret.
All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.
What about you?
I violated the Race and Resettlement Act.
Though I doubt anyone can point out the actual provision to me.
I kissed a Jewish girl.
Did your prick fall off?
GOETH: He likes women.
He likes good-looking women.
He sees a beautiful woman, he doesn't think.
I mean...
He has so many women.
And they love him.
Ja, they love him. I mean, he is married, Ja, but he's...
All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.
But you didn't see this girl.
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof...
She was very good-looking.
They cast a spell on you, you know, the Jews.
When you work closely with them, like I do, you see this.
They have this power.
It's like a virus.
Some of my men are infected with this virus.
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.
It's a matter of money? Hmm?
You're offering me a bribe?
A bribe? No.
No, please. It's a gratuity.
Heil Hitler!
Hello, Amon.
Sit down.
We give you Jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar.
You should kiss us, not them.
God forbid you ever get a real taste for Jewish skirt.
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.
That's not just good, old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.
It's policy now.
MAN: Ja, schön gefangen! Gut!
Nochmal, ja! Schön!
SOLDER: Also los! Bewegung!
Schneller hier!
Zack, zack, zack!
Beweg deinen Arsch!

Nur die ganzen Fetzen, nicht das Gemüse!
Komm, das kannst du mit den
Händen machen, fass da vorn an!
Die Kleinteile lass liegen!
So ist es! Walhalla!
Walhalla läuft hier!
GOETH: Can you believe this?
As if I don't have enough to do, they come up with this?
I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.
The party's over, Oskar.
They're closing us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.
When?
I don't know. As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.
SCHINDLER:
I've been talking to Goeth.
I know the destination.
These are the evacuation orders.
I'm to help organize the shipments, put myself on the last train.
That's not what I was going to say.
I made Goeth promise me he'll put in a good word for you.
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there.
You'll receive special treatment.
The directives coming in from Berlin mention "special treatment" more and more often.
I'd like to think that's not what you mean.
Preferential treatment, all right?
Do we have to invent a whole new language?
I think so.
You're staying, I take it.
In Krakow? What on Earth for?
What for? You have a business to run.
Of course, you'll have to hire new workers.
Poles, I guess.
They cost a little more, but...
What are you going to do?
You ran my business.
No, I'm going home.
I've done what I came here for.
I've got more money than any man can spend in a lifetime.
Some day, this is all going to end, you know.
I was going to say we'll have a drink then.
I think I better have it now.
Bible says And it still is news
Mama may have Papa may have
But God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own
Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have Papa may have
But God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own
Money, you've got lots of friends
They're pounding on your...
GOETH: I don't understand.
You want these people?
"These people"?
My people, I want my people.
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?
It's good business.
It's good business in your opinion.
Look, you've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.
Pay for all that and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.
Look, Amon...
It's good for me.
You're not telling me something.
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.
You're not telling me something.
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.
That's right.
It's good for the army.
Yeah, of course.
You know what I'm going to make?
What?
Artillery shells. Everyone's making artillery shells.
Tank shells, they need that.
Tanks shells, ja.
Everybody's happy.
Everyone's happy, except me.
You're probably scamming me somehow.
If I'm making 100, you've got to be making 300.
And if you admit to 300, then it's 400, actually. But how?
I just told you.
You did, but you didn't.
Ja, all right, don't tell me.
I'll go along with it. It's just irritating I can't work it out.
Look, all you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.
What's a person worth to you?
No, no, no, no.
What's one worth to you?
Poldek Pfefferberg.
Mila Pfefferberg.
And...
Uh... Stagel, Stagel...
Paul.
Paul Stagel.
STERN: Doctor.
The investors. I want all of them.
Yes, sir.

I'm sorry, sir.
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.
The children.
All the children.
STERN: Herbert Stier.
SCHINDLER: Thank you.
How many?
Four hundred, 450.
More, more.
Feigenbaum, Jakob.
Wolf. Wolf Wein.
Feigenbaum, Lutek, Jakob...
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.
Nacha, that's right.
SCHINDLER: And Wolf.
How many?
More.
SCHINDLER: You can do the same thing I'm doing.
You might even make money at it.
MADRITSCH: I don't know.
Come on, Julius, I know about the extra food and clothes you give them.
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach, we could get more than 4,000 out, mine and yours.
Oskar...
We could relocate them in something like safety, in Moravia.
I don't know.
How many cigarettes have you smoked tonight?
Too many.
For every one... (COUGHS) you smoke, I smoke half.
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.
No, Oskar, I can't do any more.
I will not accept that.
No.
How many? How many?
850, give or take.
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?
That's it.
You can finish that page.
What did Goeth say about this?
You just told him how many people you needed and...
You're not buying them.
You're buying them? You're paying him for each of these names?
If you were still working for me,
I'd expect you to talk me out of it.
It's costing me a fortune.
Finish the page and leave one space at the bottom.
You...
The list is an absolute good.
The list is life.
All around its margins lies the gulf.
Oskar, there's a clerical error here at the bottom of the last page.
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.
I'll never find a maid as well trained as her at Brinnlitz.
They are all country girls.
No.
No.
One hand of 21.
No.
If you win, I pay you
7,400 reichsmarks. No.
Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
No.
If I win, the girl goes on my list.
I can't wager Helen in a carol game.
Why not?
Wouldn't be right.
She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two, anyway.
What difference does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her to come back to Vienna with me.
I want her to come to work for me there.
I want to grow old with her.
Are you mad?
Amon, you can't take her to Vienna with you.
No, of course I can't.
That's what I'd like to do.
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a man, is the next most merciful thing.
I shall take her into the woods and shoot her painlessly in the back of the head.
What was it you said for a natural 21?
Was it 14,800?
Schindlerjuden to these tables!
Say your names clearly.

Wonderful, Olek, wonderful.
You know how we make ice into water?
Olek, get another one!
MAN: Alle in einer
Einzelreihe aufstellen!
You'll be pleased with the level of efficiency I get from these workers.
Budzyn, under my command, was the envy of every other commandant in the labor camp system.
The prisoners, however...
Excuse me.
They would have rather been somewhere else.
SCHINDLER: The train with the women has already left Plaszow and will be arriving here very shortly.
I know you've had a long journey.
But it's only a short walk further to the factory, where hot soup and bread is waiting for you.
Welcome to Brinnlitz!
MRS. DRESNER:
Beans in cholent?
MILA: Beans are the best part.
DANKA: I don't like beans.
Beans and meat and potatoes and bread.
That's not the way you make cholent.
Eggs in cholent?
Yes!
DANKA:
I don't like cholent.
MRS. DRESNER:
No, you don't.
What do you like?
I like caviar.
REBEKA: One day on the fire...

MAN: How old are you, mother?
WOMAN: Sixty-eight.
Cough for me, mother.
They say to fall against the fence is a kindness.
Don't kill yourself against the fence, Clara.
If you do, you'll never know what happened to you.
How old are you, mother?
Sixty-six, sir.
Sir?
Good morning.
A mistake has been made. We are not supposed to be here.
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.
Who is Oskar Schindler?
He had a factory in Krakow.
Enamelware.
A pot maker.
How old are you, mother?
You are not the only industrialist who needs labor,
Herr Schindler.
I remember earlier this year,
IG Farben ordered a trainload of Hungarians for its chemical factory.
The train came in through the archway and the officer in charge of the selection went immediately to work and sent 2,000 of them straight away to
Special Treatment.
It is not my task to interfere with the processes that take place down here.
Why do you think I can help you if I can't help IG Farben?
Allow me to express the reason.
I'm not making any judgment about you.
It's just that I know that in the coming months, we're all going to need portable wealth.
I could have you arrested.
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.
I do not say I am accepting them.
All I say is, I'm not comfortable with them on the table.
I have a shipment coming in tomorrow.
I'll cut you 300 units from it.
New ones.
These are fresh.
The train comes, we turn it around.
Mmm, yes, yes.
It's yours.
I understand.
I want these.
You shouldn't get stuck on names.
That's right. It creates a lot of paperwork.

Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?
These are mine! These are my workers!
They should be on my train!
They're skilled munitions workers!
They're essential!
Essential girls!
Their fingers polish the insides of shell metal casings.
How else am I to polish the inside of a 45 millimeter shell casing?
You tell me.
You tell me!
Back on the train!
Back on the train!
Under Department "W" provisions it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause.
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund lam entitled to file damage claims for such deaths.
If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison, I get paid.
That's how it works.
So, there will be no summary executions here.
There will be no interference of any kind with production.
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my authorization.
For your cooperation, you have my gratitude.
Come on, come.
SOLDIER: Mensch, seit Jahren hab ich so etwas nicht mehr gesehen.
SCHINDLER: Come on, boys, come.

Itzhak.
This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant. Itzhak...
You must be
Mrs. Schindler.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.
Very generous of you.
I know.
We need to talk when you have a moment.
This is my wife, Stern. I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.
Madam.
Hello.
What is it? We've received an angry complaint from the Armaments Board.
The artillery shells, tank shells, rocket casings, apparently all of them have failed quality control tests.
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
Sure, so would I, so would you.
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll get it right one of these days.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.
They could shut us down, send us back to Auschwitz.
I'll call around, find out where we can buy shells.
Pass them off as ours.
I don't see the difference.
Whether they're made here or somewhere else...
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.
You'll lose a lot of money.
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy-
WOMAN: Hello, madam.
How do you do?
How are you doing, Rabbi?
Rabbi!
Good, Herr Direktor.
Sun's going down.
Yes, it is.
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?
Is it?
What's the matter with you? You should be preparing for the Sabbath.
Shouldn't you?
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

No.
Why? Am I broke?

WINSTON CHURCHILL ON RADIO:
Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a.m.,
at General Eisenhower's headquarters,
General Jodl signed the Act of Unconditional Surrender
of all German land, sea and air forces in Europe
to the Allied
Expeditionary Force
and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.
The German war is, therefore, at an end.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) But let us not forget for a moment...
I think it's time the guards came into the factory.
Japan, with all her treachery...
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.
At midnight tonight, the war is over.
Tomorrow you'll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families.
In most cases, you won't find them.
After six long years of murder, victims are being mourned throughout the world.
We've survived.
Many of you have come up to me and thanked me.
Thank yourselves.
Thank your fearless Stern and others among you who worried about you and faced death at every moment.
I'm a member of the Nazi Party.
I'm a munitions manufacturer.
I'm a profiteer of slave labor.
I am a criminal.
At midnight you'll be free, and I'll be hunted.
I shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight, after which time, and I hope you'll forgive me,
I have to flee.
I know you have received orders from our commandant, which he has received from his superiors, to dispose of the population of this camp.
Now would be the time to do it.
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.
Or you could leave and return to your families as men instead of murderers.
In memory of the countless victims among your people,
I ask us to observe three minutes of silence.

As soon as peace occurs,
I want...
I want that cloth distributed to the workers.
Two and a half meters each.
Also, each person is to get a bottle of vodka.
They won't drink it.
They know its value.
Likewise those Egipshi cigarettes we organized.
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.
We've written a letter, trying to explain things in case you are captured.
Every worker has signed it.
Thank you.
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.
It says, "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."
I could have got more out.
I could have got more.
I don't know.
If I just...
I could have got more.
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are alive because of you. Look at them.
If I'd made more money.
I threw away so much money.
(SOBBING) You have no idea.
If I had just...
There will be generations because of what you did.
I didn't do enough.
You did so much.
This car.
Goeth would've bought this car.
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.
Ten people.
Ten more people.
This pin...
Two people.
This is gold.
Two more people.
He would have given me two for it, at least one.
He would have given me one, one more.
One more person.
A person, Stern.
For this.
(SOBBING) I could have gotten one more person, and I didn't.
And I didn't!
You have been liberated by the Soviet Army!
Have you been in Poland?
I just came from Poland.
Are there any Jews left?
Where should we go?
RUSSIAN OFFICER: Don't go east, that's for sure.
They hate you there.
I wouldn't go west either, if I were you.
We could use some food.
Isn't there a town over there?

Off to prison, American Satans.
Americans were shocked by the announcement of the failure of yet another mission to rescue hostages from the Middle East.
Informed sources reveal that the rescue team itself has been captured and added to those already being held.
Reports also indicate that an attempt on the life of a terrorist dictator was thwarted at the same time.
With the election 10 days away, it may be a setback for the White House.
Presidential challenger
Senator Gray Edwards
commented on the failed mission.
This is no time for partisan politics.
Bringing our people home should be our priority.
Despite this crisis, the president put on his best political face
continuing on his campaign schedule.
Benson's 20-point lead in the poll six months ago
has plummeted since the hostage crisis began.
The CNN/Victoria's
Secret catalog poll
has the president and Edwards running neck and neck.
Today, Benson made a brief stop in Fergus Falls, Virginia
- for a groundbreaking of a library.
- You took my baby!
The five living former chief executives
Presidents Bush, Reagan,
Carter, Ford and Nixon
were on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony.
Correspondent Jeri Kelter reports on this historic moment.
The library is to be built near the Fergus Falls Civic Center.
- President Benson made no statements.
- Oh! My knee!
Publicly, he seemed unaware of the political blow he had been dealt.
Privately, aides marveled at his spirit as he performed his morning routine by milking the White House goats and eating two helpings of grapefruit and creamed corn.
Tonight, the president and his top advisers will burn the midnight oil.
Sabotage.
My God, man, what does it mean?
We must tighten security, sir.
Find out who's behind it.
No, no, no. The word "sabotage."
What does it mean?
Someone's subverting our mission, sir.
One of our own may be aiding the enemy.
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in!
Mr. President.
Oh, Jesus! Don't you ever sneak up on me like that again.
What is it, Bob?
If Edwards hears of this, he'll use it against you.
- He'll try to prove you're incompetent.
- I can prove that too.
Mr. President, the CIA can't afford another failure.
We'll send Colonel Walters to get our people.
To ensure success, we need Topper Harley.
MICHELLE:
We've located him in the Far East.
Topper Harley.
We've served together before, sir.
There's no one better.
- Cookie?
- Not me, sir.
- Young lady?
- No, thank you.
No, no, I was just offering him a young lady.
Oh, yeah, Topper Harley.
Good. I love the boy.
Kid's got guts.
There isn't a fighting man on this planet that can...
Gotcha! Listening at the door, huh?
Well, Walters, looks like we've got our saboteur.
That's your wife, sir.
Huh! Yeah, so it is.
Lavinia. You're looking as lovely as the day we met.
Find out what she knows.
As for you, get me Topper Harley.
Hm?
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles!
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles...
You fight!
USHER:
Aisle 5, mezzanine, to your left.
PROGRAM SELLER: Get your program right here. Program!
SUBWAY CUSTOMER:
One pig snout sandwich.
Both fighters are showing signs of fatigue.
ANNOUNCER: They aren't moving around the ring as much.
Hey, this is where your conditioning pays off.
TOPPER:
Coochie-coochie-coo. Coochie-goo.
WOMAN'S VOICE: You win!
Topper, Topper, Topper, Topper...
Topper Harley!
Mmm.
Topper.
I don't believe it.
- Topper.
- Colonel.
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.
You want to tell me about it?
Well, they let me live here.
I help out fixing things.
It's peaceful. Quiet.
No one is allowed to talk.
And that dim sum fighting in the warehouse yesterday?
I do that for the extra money.
And to satisfy my male cravings to kill and win.
Colonel, who are they?
She's CIA.
- The other man's an extra.
- Ah.
What does she do?
Heads up Middle East covert operations.
Reports directly to Benson.
TOPPER: Colonel, these men have taken a supreme vow of celibacy.
Like their fathers and grandfathers.
They haven't seen a woman in decades.
WALTERS: Miss Huddleston!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
This is Michelle Huddleston.
Topper Harley.
Pleasure.
- You're not easy to find.
- Why are you keeping track?
It's like the colonel says:
Good men are hard to find.
I don't know what you know about the last war, but some of our men were missing in action.
On two occasions we sent in squads to rescue those men.
Both squads failed.
We must get the men who went to get the men who went to get the men.
- I'm here to make sure we succeed.
- What's this got to do with me?
I'm going this time.
- We want you to go with him.
- Why me, ma'am?
Because you're the best of what's left.
My war is over.
Mmm... Ah!
It's a few extra dollars now.
But you'll make that back on your heating bill.
We're gonna caulk the ashram if you want to stop by.
Thanks, Bob.
This mission's important. We've got to take care of our people.
Come with me.
When are you gonna put
Ramada behind you?
- What are you saying?
- You say your war is over.
Maybe the one out there is, but not the one inside you.
You running from the pain won't solve anything.
Because wherever you go, you take the pain with you.
You've come an awful long way to lecture me.
You were hurt when that woman left.
You're using that to hide from who you really are.
- That was a long time ago.
- MICHELLE: Thank you. Next!
I don't want it.
Nice butt.
Topper, let me tell you a little story.
It seems there were three bears.
One day when their porridge was too hot, they took a walk.
A little blond girl skipped through the woods and she ate their porridge and sat in their chairs and slept in their beds.
And when those bears returned and discovered that mess...
- Do you know what happened then?
- No.
That little blond girl got scared.
Ran away.
So, what you're saying is, that little blond girl is me.
So I should color my hair...
Topper, they didn't make you this fighting machine.
They just cooked up the porridge and went for a walk.
You won't stop running until you face your three bears.
Ramada.
Colonel.
I'm sorry.
It has to end for me sometime.
If you should change your mind here's my 900 number.
It's $5.00 a minute.
I'll waive the charges.
WALTERS: your three bears.
Ramada. Ramada. Ramada.
If our lips should meet
Inamorata
Don Corleone.
Kiss me, kiss me sweet
Inamorata
Hold me close
And say goodnight
With a love
As warm as wine
I'm at heaven's door
Inamorata
Want you more and more
Inamorata
You're a symphony
A very beautiful sonata
My inamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart
My love
You're a symphony
A very beautiful sonata
My inamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart
My love
Hey, what's wrong, kid?
I love you so much.
But it's such a crazy world. I don't want anything to happen to us.
Don't worry.
In a few days, we'll be on the train to Hawaii.
We'll find a minister to marry us, and we'll never be apart.
But if something should keep us apart?
If one of us can't make it to Blenheim Train Station?
Like, for instance, if something came up unexpectedly.
Not that I think it would.
Or it already has.
Wherever I'll be, I want you to know that...
Kiss me.
Kiss me like you've never kissed me before.
You will denounce the criminal acts against our people by your president.
Sign here. Initial here, here, and here.
Phil!
Sign the document.
I see you're no stranger to pain.
I've been married.
- Twice.
- Oy!
Like the previous six, this victim was found folded neatly in half
inside the glove compartment of a sanitation truck.
Police are baffled.
This just in.
Presidential military adviser
Colonel Denton Walters
has been captured during an aborted attempt to free our hostages.
This tape was delivered to us just moments ago.
They are treating me good here.
The food is tasty and nourishing.
The peaceful leader of this country
has asked me to appeal to you, Mr. President
to stop your vicious, imperialistic tactics around the globe.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome
to His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Japan
Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.
The president of the United
States, Thomas Benson.
Mr. President, this is Prime Minister
Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.
President Benson, where's your first lady?
I don't know. I've had lots of women.
Lost my flower at the age of 15.
I can't keep track.
Let's get this over with.
I feel ill.
My intestines were removed during action in the North Atlantic.
Took a torpedo in the gut. My bowels were replaced with hemp.
- Clogs easily.
- I hope you feel better.
Well, my lips to yours.
ANNOUNCER: The junior senator from Minnesota, Gray Edwards.
President Benson,
Prime Minister Soto, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight we put election politics aside as I join you as majority whip and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in welcoming the
Japanese prime minister and his lovely wife to these United States.
- Our two great nations have begun...
- (STOMACH RUMBLES) what we hope will be a long and successful dialogue.
Ptooh!
- ANNOUNCER: Not only...
- I don't remember eating that.
I feel better now.
It's that raw fish odor.
It makes...
Oh, God.
Look at that! Those my teeth?
ANNOUNCER: Only to continue in the highest spirit...
Yeah. They're filthy!
And so I would like to propose a toast.
- Oh, thank you, Yoko.
- I'll take that, sir.
To world peace.
To a clean environment.
To harmony with our planet and world prosperity.
Thank you.
Looking for a place to sit, lieutenant?
I must talk to the president.
Can you arrange that?
- You'd be amazed what I can do.
- It's my fault they got Walters.
I want to go in.
You showed up just in time.
We leave in the morning.
I'm taking charge of this mission.
You mind working under a woman?
ANNOUNCER: And now, the president of the United States, Thomas Benson.
Prime Minister Tojo,
Senator Edwards, my fellow Americans and our millions of illegal aliens.
It seems like only yesterday
I was strafing your homes.
Here I am today, begging you not to make such good cars.
Excuse me. I need a glass of water.
Damn tongue's dry.
It's not mine, you know.
Lost mine in Laos. Little commie lopped it off.
It's probably a doorstop somewhere.
Got this one from a basset hound.
Get the car.
President Benson.
No, you're not.
I've seen him. He's older, about my height.
Sir, this is Topper Harley.
Topper. Yes, of course.
Son I never had.
Well, no damn wonder
I didn't recognize you then.
Word of advice, don't call yourself the president.
I wouldn't, neither should you.
It doesn't hold water.
For that matter, neither do I. Let's get away from these power cables.
- I'd like to join the next mission.
- God bless you, boy.
This one's on the QT.
It's called "Secret Mission to
Get Walters and Our Boys Back."
When you come back, I'm gonna throw you wonderful guys a party.
And there should be plenty to eat.
I doubt more than half of you will return.
Thank you.
Got a light, lieutenant?
I quit smoking.
Besides, I don't think it's allowed here.
What are they gonna do, arrest me for smoking?
- I know what to get you for Christmas.
- A Thighmaster? I've broken three.
Really?
Let's go to my apartment and discuss our mission.
I'm putty in your hands.
In my hands, nothing turns to putty.
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
DRIVER: Hmm.
- (SQUEAKS)
- Give in this time and show me some affection
- We're going for those pleasures in the night
- (HONKS)
I want to love you
Feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you
Please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow
I'll let it go
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it
I'm so excited
- Hm?
- And I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you
We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
If we're still playing around, boy, that's just fine
Let's get excited
We just can't hide it
No, no, no
- (MICHELLE MOANS)
- I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it
Oh, yeah
I'm so excited
- Oh.
- And I just can't hide it
No, no, no, no, no
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you
I want you
Ooh, boy
I'm so excited
- (BED SQUEAKS)
- And I just can't hide it
No, no, no, no, no
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you
I want you
I'm so excited
What you do to me
I just can't hide it
You've got me burning up
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it, yeah
I'm so excited
Yippee! Woo-hoo!
Yippee-ki-yay! Woo!
ANNOUNCER: In an emotional address at the state capitol
Nebraska Governor, Paul Burmaster,
made a public apology for his state being so flat.
Where are you?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
My arm's asleep.
No, something else.
My leg too.
Please, you can tell me.
Well...
Topper.
I have to wee-wee.
Look, I told myself last night was just going to be last night.
I guess I just never counted on finding a guy so deep, so sensitive.
I've fallen for you, Topper.
I've fallen for you big time.
There's someone else, isn't there?
I have no idea what you mean.
Women sense these things.
I said there's no one.
I'm fine.
I know about Ramada, Topper.
I read your dossier.
She must be quite a woman.
And what if she was?
Was?
ANNOUNCER: Last call for Train 590 for
Glendale, San Francisco and Honolulu.
Board! Board!
I told you. Warned you twice.
Harley.
- Topper Harley.
- Right here.
RAMADA: I cannot go with you or ever see you again.
Just believe that I love you.
You must be brave, my darling.
This card is printed on recycled paper.
HARBINGER: Sergeant pick that up.
Someone could trip over it.
Which one of you is
Michelle Huddleston?
She is.
I'm glad you're here. The hostages are being moved.
I'm Commander Armin
Harbinger. I'm in charge.
Sorry, commander.
Presidential orders.
We're in charge now.
- MICHELLE: Any questions?
- HARBINGER: No, ma'am.
Harley, I've been there.
I've seen the enemy. If you're not ready, you won't make it.
I've fired a couple of guns.
I'll assemble the men, with your permission.
Gentlemen, Ms. Huddleston, CIA, and Lieutenant Topper Harley.
We're working for them.
Williams, com sync pac ram set
MOS 92-H tact op spec patty-wack.
- Patty-wack?
- Give a dog a bone, sir.
Of course.
Rabinowitz, demolition. Can't wait to blow something up for you.
I look forward to it.
Commander Harbinger advised me we have 11 hours to free the prisoners.
After that, we may lose them forever.
This is the prison camp area.
It's heavily guarded, but they won't expect an attack from the jungle.
Your contact, code name Bench
Press, will lead you to the camp.
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.
Good luck.
Topper!
I know we haven't had much time together but when you go into battle, take something of mine with you.
Your lucky mole.
Topper, what are you reading?
Great Expectations.
- Is it any good?
- It's not all I hoped for.
Know what I'm gonna do if we make it?
I'm gonna go back to Eagle River and marry my gal, Edith Mae.
Gonna get us a nice little place with a white picket fence.
You know the kind.
Two-car garage.
Maybe a fishing boat.
And in 15 years, when they're all paid for,
I'll set my charges and blow the shit out of them.
You got a girl, Topper?
Penny to Sky King, no parents in sight. Party is on.
Green, green, green...
Hook up.
Geronimo!
Geronimo!
Me!
Ahh.
Thanks, brothers.
Jeez!
Stop it!
- Ramada.
- Topper.
- What are you doing here?
- This is Bench Press, our contact.
- I didn't know.
- You know each other?
Yes. Yes, we do.
It's been a long time.
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was The Flurvian Sea.
- You remember?
- I remember every detail.
The sky was blue. You wore gray.
I was in chiffon.
Topper, there's so much to say.
You're as pretty as when you dumped me.
You've changed.
That beauty mark.
It was a... It's a gift.
HARBINGER: Very touching, but it's no time to reminisce.
We must be at the rendezvous point in seven hours or we miss our pickup.
It's your show, hero.
Let's move out.
Follow me.
We're late. I know a shortcut.
- WOMAN: The meat's smoking.
- MAN: Shut up.
- Let's take it off the grill.
- Leave me alone.
- Frank, you're drunk again.
- Whose fault is that?
This is the best way to the prison compound.
They see many boats, so they won't be suspicious.
There are clothes in the wheelhouse.
TOPPER: Somebody once wrote,
"Hell is the impossibility of reason."
That's what this place feels like. Hell.
I hate it already, and it's only been a few hours.
I'm so tired. We get up at 5:00...
MARTIN SHEEN: At first I thought they'd handed me the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe they wanted him dead.
Third generation West Point.
Top of his class.
Korea, Airborne,
about a thousand decorations, et cetera, et cetera.
I loved you in Wall Street!
An enemy control boat has changed course and is heading for our people.
Send the alert.
Hello, Lucky. Report my signal.
OPERATOR: Report my signal. Over.
Hello, George Mike Walters.
Strength three. Over.
Recon reports Indians on the
Warpath in your area. Over.
No Indians here. Over.
Do not take literally. Repeat.
Do not take literally.
The vultures are circling the carcass. Repeat.
The vultures are circling the carcass.
I see a couple of gulls, but...
Pit bull's out of the cage.
Crips are raiding the store.
Hey, you yanking my crank?
They see a woman, they will know we are masquerading.
Only men are allowed to do the fishing.
Topper.
Why did you have to come here now?
Of all the missions in all the jungles...
- ...you had to walk into this one.
- I tried to stay away.
I thought I'd never see you again, that you were out of my life.
But it's a sequel. I had to come.
Do you know what the critics will say?
- "Same warmed-over characters..."
- Topper, stop it.
You're only using this whole casting thing as an excuse to hide what's hurting you.
Hurt? Maybe. Once.
But I knew this day would come.
I knew one day you'd come crawling back begging for forgiveness.
Groveling, sniveling, pleading for another chance.
Sorry, sweetheart, but this all-day sucker is down to the soggy stick.
No, Topper, you don't understand.
I'm married. I was married before you and I ever met.
I'm still married today.
- You're joking.
- I'm not.
- You've got to be.
- If I was joking I would say,
"A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, 'Why the long face?"'
You are married.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought he was dead.
He worked for the CIA, training pilots in Germany.
Highest security.
They told me he died over Villenshtoben.
The day before we were to go
I got word he was alive, in a hospital in Berlin.
I had to go to him.
They ordered me not to tell anyone.
- I know how you must feel.
- You do, huh?
You know how it feels to have your heart shot and tied to the hood of a car?
To be passed like a large kidney stone?
Ramada,
I don't think so.
Patrol boat!
Remember, we're not American.
These boys aren't stupid.
Where's Harbinger?
Shut off your engine.
Shut off your engine.
We're boarding.
Hm.
Kareem of Onion! Al Jarreau!
Go on! Get out of here!
Take that to the bank and cash it!
Swim for shore!
Save yourselves!
Swim for it! I'll catch up.
Go!
Omar Sharif!
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!
Whoa!
Topper?
ANNOUNCER: President Benson is returning to Washington today
to speak to the nation in what experts are calling
the pivotal address of his political career.
- How is the speech coming, sir?
- Hm?
Oh, I'm practicing my A's.
- This look like an A to you?
- Yes, sir.
All right.
What's that, Bill?
We just received word from
Michelle. Harley is missing.
- His boat has been demolished.
- Oh, damn it!
Every time I give an order, it gets screwed up!
Plan a reception, wrong hors d'oeuvres.
Appoint an ambassador, he leaves the country.
Mr. President, we need a plan.
This may be our last chance to get the hostages out.
All right.
Here's where we are and here is where they are.
- Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.
- Oh, no time for prayer, Bob.
- Here's the target area.
- That's Minnesota, sir.
Damn it, man, that's the genius of my plan.
Why go over there to fight?
We can do it right here at home.
- Sir, the enemy is over there.
- Then we'll fly them over here.
Their families too. We'll teach them to skate...
- Do I have to think of everything?
- But the hostages!
It is imperative that you act now!
Topper?
TOPPER: Whoooaaa.
Topper! You made it!
That's right, Cindy, it's
23 minutes past the hour.
And now here's the Buckinghams with Kind of a Drag.
You're bleeding.
I'll be all right.
Something else bothers me a lot more.
Harbinger, where were you when the patrol boat arrived?
Below, sweeping the boat for bombs.
What are you accusing me of?
Nothing, yet. But I want you to know I smell a rat.
Don't push me. Before you bagged your first babe,
I was slitting throats for a living.
I'm not saying I don't trust you, and I'm not saying I do. But I don't.
Save it for the enemy.
We got a job to do.
Oh, look. I'm cut too.
Oh.
WILLIAMS: They got me too.
It's a real gusher.
Let's get going.
There's a guard at the gate.
He's mine.
Wait here.
Topper.
- Topper.
- Jesus!
Before we go in, you should know something.
- What now?
- Have you heard of Dexter Hayman?
The freedom fighter?
Yeah, he won the Nobel Prize for inventing the artificial appendix.
Exactly. Dexter is one of the captives.
- He's my husband.
- You've got to be joking.
If I was joking, I would say,
"A rabbi, a priest and a minister walk into a bar..."
Okay, he is your husband.
Topper, I was so young, just a schoolgirl.
He was an older man, so wise in the ways of the world.
He used to come around the schoolyard, day after day.
I so admired his persistence.
Even the restraining order my parents slapped on him was no deterrent.
He opened my eyes to the arts, music, clog-dancing, WrestleMania.
His work has meant so much to so many.
And I owe him everything, Topper.
Everything.
I'm happy for you, kid.
But if you think you can hurt me again, you're wrong.
I left my heart in my other pants.
Go.
Oy!
Ah!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Ah!
Mm!
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
PRESIDENT: The Iraqi coast.
Oh, those bluffs look treacherous.
Hadn't counted on that.
But if God is on our side, we will rendezvous on Lincoln's wart by noon.
That's it, men.
We're going in!
PRESIDENT:
My rescue mission was underway.
But two things kept running through my mind.
Would we get to the men in time?
And why did I bring helium instead of air?
I'll go to the rear.
Take the front door.
The keys.
- What?
- Enough!
I'll have a hamburger.
- Where are the prisoners?
- There.
- TOPPER: Let's go!
- I'll take the back gate.
Now, that's a hell of a gun.
- Where's Dexter Hayman?
- Villa compound 405.
Okay. I'm here.
"Terrorist Mountain."
"It's a Small War." "Pirates of the Persian Gulf."
"Hostage Mover."
Ah! "Dexter's Dungeon."
Harbinger, what are you doing here?
I was right, wasn't I? You sabotaged the other missions.
- I find that unacceptable.
- You got me wrong.
All these years, fighting, and shooting and killing.
I just... I can't go on. I...
Hey, hey, hey, rainy face!
Hey, proud warrior.
Let the sun come out, you big bad G.I. Joe.
You know, kitten, we all have permission to make mistakes.
It's called "learning."
You give your Uncle Topper a nice big blow.
I'm done.
Thattaboy.
Thanks. I can kill again.
- You've given me a reason to live.
- Good.
Head for the gate. Plenty of bad guys to shoot on the way.
EVERREADY BUNNY: Keeps going, and going, and going, and going.
Nothing outlasts the...
Oh!
Yes!
There's a copter pad half a mile away.
- That's our ticket out.
- We can't leave. Not without Dexter.
Topper! Watch out!
For a moment there,
I thought you were...
Gabriella Sabatini?
I get that all the time.
It must be the nose.
Ironically, I haven't picked up a racket in years.
You saved my life.
Topper, no matter what happens,
I want you to know that
I never stopped loving you.
Let's move out!
You know how to get to the copter pad.
If I'm not there in 15, you know what to do.
- We get the hell out of here.
- No! Wait another 15 minutes.
PRESIDENT: We could hear gunfire from the compound.
From out of nowhere, a patrol boat appeared.
How would we get past the soldiers on that boat?
Then, suddenly, it happened.
Take cover!
Guys.
Jeez!
That's it, good night.
War. It's fantastic!
Drop the gun!
Drop it!
You will die, Yankee bastard man.
How you say? Like a dog.
Now march!
March!
I kill you where you stand, you imperialist Yankee-Doodle dork.
Slippery rascal!
Butcher of Baghdad. Hello?
Well, hello.
Who is it? Who is it?
- Your wife, Hillary Rodham Hussein.
- Jesus! I'm so stupid!
I was supposed to pick her up.
Tell her I'm at the gym.
No, I'm out of town.
On business. Bombing, gassing, execution.
- Something. Make it up.
- I'm sorry. Just missed him.
I owe you one.
Ali MacGraw! My eyes.
You little...! I'm going to split you like a melon!
Now I will kill you until you die from it.
PRESIDENT: In a pig's ear.
- Mr. President!
- Suffering succotash!
Looks like the upper hand is on the other foot, Saddam.
Ah-ha.
Uh-oh!
Yes!
My skin's made of asbestos.
Tanning parlor accident at Dien Bien Phu.
Go on about your business. I got a bone to settle with this guy.
Yes, sir. I'll get Dexter.
Let's make this a fair fight.
DARTH VADER'S VOICE: I've been waiting for you, O Big One.
We meet at last.
The circle is complete.
- Now I am the master!
- Only the master of evil, Saddam.
Your powers are...
NORMAL VOICE: Your powers are weak. You shouldn't have come.
Well, I have. We'll settle this the old Navy way.
First guy to die, loses!
Water. Water! Water, please.
- It's locked. From the inside.
- No!
- Damn it!
- We're gonna die!
- Get ahold of yourself!
- Blow it!
- It's not our property.
- Do it. Do it!
SOLDIER: Oh, Mr. Geppetto!
Go ahead. Shoot. You'll get nothing from me.
You are filth. I spit in the face of filth.
- I've come to get you out of here.
- You're American.
Yes, from America. Let's go.
My friend, I yearn for freedom as much as anyone but I run from no man.
You've got to come with me.
I can't walk.
They've tied my shoelaces together.
A knot.
Bastards.
I'm aborting the mission. Envelope is closed. We're lifting off.
TAXI DRIVER:
Here you go. It's $4.50.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Onboard. We're getting out.
What about the others?
We just can't leave them.
Wait! I can't go any further.
I need a drink.
Okay. Right a bit.
Whoa, stop there.
Down a bit, down a bit. There.
It's not very cold. Is this filtered?
Their artillery will be down on us soon. We have to go.
No! We'll lose Topper and Dexter.
But that's been the idea all along, hasn't it, Michelle?
You're looking beautiful as ever,
Ramada. How did you know?
I didn't. It all came together when I saw you here.
I remembered your inscription in my yearbook.
You wrote, "Remember the fun we had in class"
"and I'll fuck up your life if it's the last thing I do."
And then I realize where
I had last seen this.
What could I have done to make you so vindictive?
Goodness sake. You know each other.
Oh, Ramada, how could you have been so blind?
You were too wrapped up in being
Miss Perfect College to notice me.
Why concern yourself with the feelings of one insignificant roommate?
One fabulous day, one incredible experience.
I had no idea it meant so much to you.
I remember that day as if it were yesterday.
The exhilaration of experimenting, sharing something so new, so dangerous,
- so intimate.
- Go on.
RAMADA: And I'll never forget the look on your face.
The way the sweat glistened on your hard body.
Then you tied my ankles.
Tighter. Tighter.
But it just wasn't right.
It wasn't natural.
Bungee-jumping is just too dangerous a sport.
Bungee-jumping? That's it?
How could you hurt so many innocent people?
Oh, Ramada! It was always so easy for you.
How could you understand?
I had Dexter imprisoned because
I wanted you to suffer
- as much as you made me suffer.
- You fool!
When I discovered I couldn't win Topper because he loved you, I tried to have you killed.
He... He still loves me.
You turned your back on America because of your jealousy.
You're gonna pay for this.
Good doggy!
Ew.
Ah-huh!
Aluminum siding. Ten-year guarantee. No paint needed.
Hm.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Ha! You missed!
It'll take more than that to stop me, you devils!
Don't jiggle me.
SADDAM: Advil! Midol! Get over here! To the helicopter.
They clicked with the wrong dictator.
This means war!
You better let me handle this, son.
Ew. You're so sweaty.
- WALTERS: I knew you'd make it.
- It's about time.
- Michelle.
- She's our saboteur.
Can you get me off for old times' sake?
Sorry, precious. You sold out the greatest country in the world.
And to think I wore your mole.
Get her out of here.
Dexter?
Ramada.
Oh, dear Dexter. Look what they've done to your shoelaces.
Oh, my darling. You've no idea what I've just been through.
But now we're together again.
We have much to look forward to.
I want to do it all.
Donahue. Geraldo.
Sally Jessy. Oh, and who's that black chick...?
- Oprah.
- Yes! Yes. Her too.
Let's go! It's getting hot here.
I'm going back for the president.
Topper!
I'm staying here with you.
Get on that helicopter with
Dexter, where you belong.
Why? I thought you loved me.
Ramada, I do love you.
I've tried to forget you but no matter what, your face is on the tip of my tongue.
Then let me stay with you.
Ramada, I want to be with you.
I want to hold you.
Meet your parents and pet your dog.
My parents are dead.
My dog ate them.
I'm sorry. We both know you belong with Dexter.
You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.
I'm not being noble, but do you have any idea what'd happen if you stay?
Of course I do.
Sex. Wild, free, passionate, unbridled sex.
I'd fondle you in ways you can't imagine.
I would pleasure you at any time, in any place, in any way, for as long as you could possibly desire.
You better get going.
You'll miss your takeoff.
Goodbye, Topper. God bless you.
Wait, let me get a shot of you two.
It'll be great for the talk shows.
Let's frame this up.
Closer together.
Come on. Don't be shy.
Put your arm around her.
I've almost got it.
This is a great shot.
My God, you're gonna love this!
You know, under other circumstances, you'd make a great couple.
Oh, well. Say che...
You're moving too much.
Quit spinning!
This'll make me rich and f...
- He really was a wiener!
- Don't get me started.
Hold it there! Hold it!
This buggy going to America?
I was afraid we'd lost you!
Lost? Not a chance.
Shove over! I get the window seat.
- SOLDIER: They're in my sights.
- Just a second! This is personal.
We're too heavy.
We need to lose weight.
One can have a dream, baby
Two can make that dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can say how it really feels
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Make a dream come true
Just take two
One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a crowd
Like an island, he's all alone
Two can make it just anyplace
Seems just like being home
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
Just take two
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-oo-ooh
Just take two
Just take two
Ooh, one can go out to a movie
Looking for a special treat
Two can make that single room
Something really kinda sweet
Yeah, one can take a walk in the moonlight
Thinkin' that it's really nice
But two walkin' hand in hand
Is like addin' just a pinch of spice
Yeah, it takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
Just take two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true
STUDIO ANNOUNCER: Hot Shots!
Part Deux was filmed in Hollywood
in front of a live studio audience.
To our fathers and their children...
Once upon a time, there was a country... and its capital was Belgrade.
April 6, 1941...
I'll kill them, my friend!
Careful, my friend!
I'll kill them!
Don't, it's dangerous!
Ivan, my brother!
The Vice-President spoke of increased cooperation between the two nations of Yugoslavia.
That's my brother... and his best friend, Blacky!
Hooligans! Hooligans!
What can I do?
They're all I... have.
Marko!
Come in for a cup of coffee.
Impossible, man, I'm in a hurry!
My friend's tired!
I'm tired...
I'll buy you lunch tomorrow at "The Russian Tsar"!
Get off that horse and get in the house!
Vera, I'm a free man, you hear?
A free man?
You're kidding!
Damn it!
Vera, I have something important to tell you.
Listen...
What?
Don't be angry...
We enrolled Petar in the Communist Party.
A whore-house rather!
He's one of us now.
Get inside!
Okay, just one last word to my friend.
Get inside.
I have to sort things out with him.
See who I have to live with!
I love you.
Let me kiss you.
Not on the lips, fucker!
Blacky!
Get in the house!
She's like this every morning!
I'll leave you, just like Marko's wife left him.
I'm a free man...
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo...
Part One - The War
In the attic, a small apartment...
On the wall...
Looloo... Breakfast!
A small clock on the wall...
Is ticking... tick-tock...
In the attic... an apartment...
Does your mother obey you?
Soni!
That's it! Do it! Go on!
- Let go!
- The best is yet to come!
Wait!
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
How can you keep eating?
I can and that's that.
How can you, with all these bombs?
Out of spite!
You want me to die hungry?
My shoes!
Not my shoes!
You fat horse!
I've had enough.
That does it!
They're bombing my city!
Raiding my city!
My own city!
Where are you going, Blacky?
To "greet" the fucking criminals who've come to destroy my city!
- I know where you're going!
- You do?
I know!
To see that whore!
What whore?
You're crazy, you really are.
That actress.
What?
I'm defending my country!
- Don't lie!
- Vera!
You're defending that whore!
God, it's impossible to have a serious talk with you!
What are you saying?
You get on my nerves!
Here it is!
I'm saying what the whole town is saying.
What is it, my love?
You never leave that theatre!
You're in that theatre every night.
I know, I love the theatre.
You love the theatre?
You love the theatre!
So? What's so strange about that?
You love that whore, not the theatre!
If you weren't pregnant...
You'd what?
You lying creep!
- Me?
- Yes, you!
You, you scum!
What is it? What?
Shame on you, Vera!
Blacky!
What's happening?
Don't cry!
I'll build you a new zoo.
Come on...
Look...
Get lost!
The survivors will be eaten, can't you see?
Here's some money.
Buy some milk for the baby monkey.
Come on, stop crying.
The Germans will make fun of you.
National Theatre
Clearance Team
Working hard, artists?
You bet!
Bato, sweets!
Uncle Blacky!
Are you avoiding me?
Let's not play games.
You're dead right!
What do you mean?
You know very well what I mean!
No, I don't.
I don't!
You want me and Bato in a prison camp?
What?
The whole city is talking about it.
You thief!
Me?
What's the town saying?
Don't try to act stupid.
You steal people's gold and money.
You steal!
I only steal from the rich... what they stole from the poor!
- Stop it...
- You stop it!
Working hard?
Do you love me?
Well, yes.
Come on, give me a kiss!
You love me!
I've been looking for you for days.
I'm scared.
You get on my nerves!
You get on mine!
Have you seen this?
You're a wanted man.
Ten thousand!
Ten thousand for my life!
Rubbish!
Franz!
Franz?
Fr鋟lein Zovko...
Oh, Franz!
Good morning.
I've been waiting.
We have a table waiting at "The Russian Tsar".
Yes... and my brother?
Seisenberger, do me a favour.
Take this "vehicle" and follow us.
But carefully!
Franz...
Ivan, open up!
Stay there by the door and don't move!
Ivan!
My God, it stinks in here!
Vera, take a seat!
My brother's like Noah saving the world after the flood.
Don't move and keep quiet!
What are you doing?
Shame on you!
Always hanging yourself!
My God...
I've had enough of this life...
Enough? Instead of helping me and being a hero, you hang yourself like a sissy!
Shame on you!
An announcement from the Gestapo to citizens of Belgrade and other towns.
Bandits robbed a train full of arms and munitions last night.
The attack was the work of the Communist criminals,
Petar Popara, known as Blacky, and Marko Dren.
What have you done?
Nothing. Last night, we roughed up a few thieves.
Marko, oh Lord...
Someone ratted on us.
Some bastard squealer gave our names!
Our comrades were arrested.
Was Blacky arrested?
Taken in?
Arrested, my ass, just as they'll never catch me.
Come on, hurry up!
Why do I have to come?
Because you're my brother.
Let him go!
Come on, people!
No, it's nothing!
I can manage!
Who is it?
It's me, grandad!
Who is it?
It's me! Marko!
Who?
Marko, for God's sake!
Who?
It's me, Marko! Open up!
It's you, Marko!
Yes, it's me.
Come on in!
The Germans could be here any minute!
Go downstairs,
I'll take care of your stuff later.
The cellar's behind the stove.
Let them through!
Come on!
Where are you taking those animals?
It's not a zoo down there, it's a shelter for humans!
I'm closing!
This is horrible!
Horrible!
Where are you now, Blacky, you bastard?
Has it st... st...
Yes, it's started, it's started!
It's started!
Grandad!
Marko!
Blacky's wife
...is giving birth!
- Out of the way!
Please, quickly!
Bring some water, a sheet, any white piece of cloth...
Quickly! It's coming!
Don't worry.
Is everything all right?
It will be, but I need more light.
Right, lift up the bicycle!
Come on, higher!
Ivan!
I don't feel well.
Everything will be fine.
No, it won't. It won't.
If anything happens to me... call him Jovan.
Vera!
3 years later,
Belgrade was suffering an open fracture of its soul...
Stop, stop, swift waters of the Ibar
Why are you in such a hurry
All together!
I have my sorrows too
Deeper than you may know
The drinks are on me.
It's my son's birthday!
Here's my Jovan!
Look at him!
Handsome lad, Blacky!
Congratulations!
He will be, Mustafa!
I'll send him to school in Moscow to be an officer, not a thief like you.
You motherfucking crook!
We're partners.
But for how long?
What's up?
Are you thieves getting jumpy?
My friend!
Happy birthday to your Jovan, my friend!
My good old friend!
Look at him.
He's my spitting image!
With a hint of Vera.
You think so?
What kept you?
There's a traitor among us.
We've got problems.
Those three are here.
I saw them. Hang around.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Good evening!
If you please, gentlemen...
I'm doing this for your own good.
Gentlemen, please...
Franz!
Flowers for Natalija!
He kills us and fucks her!
Excuse me.
Get me the biggest bouquet you can find.
Sure.
- What about the priest?
- All arranged.
Perfect...
My friend, there'll be a wedding!
Now let's play fair.
Here's my gun, give me yours.
That's fair.
This is gold. See it?
This is gold, right?
How much did the gold bring in?
Look at it!
How much did it bring in?
Look at it!
How much for the gold?
Mustafa, you said 120,000.
Never mind.
Now tell me where the weapons are and we're done.
I swear on my mother's grave, the Germans took them.
Leave your mother out of this!
Motherfucker!
You steal my money?
I rob banks, jewellery stores, and you fuckers steal my money!
You dirty fucking thieves!
I'll kill you all, you bastards!
I'll clean Belgrade of scum like you!
Our comrades are shot in the woods, they eat roots and you steal...
You've gone crazy!
No, guys, we don't play this way...
Hold these, honey, please.
Faster and louder!
Here I come, my friend!
Hang on!
Watch out!
Here I come!
Not in my ear!
Left! Left! Left!
I have to tell you something, you being the Party Secretary...
If anything, it'll be these thieves and criminals who'll cost us our heads.
Right. We rob stores to buy arms and food for our comrades.
And the bastards steal from us!
"I'll kill myself.
"You say you'll kill yourself.
"But you won't do it.
"Are you so sure?
"Do you think a man can live..."
Quiet!
"...if he has nothing and nobody to live for?
"Are you capitulating?
"No, I suggest
"that we make peace."
He's entranced by her!
I'll kill him, I swear!
The other actors don't interest him!
I think the Captain's excellent.
- Really?
- Yes, look at him!
Quiet!
Hands off.
This is a theatre, watch the show!
Good evening.
"Promise to tell me
"the truth and I'll forgive you in advance.
"Is Berta my child?
"I cannot assume the guilt
"for a deed I didn't commit."
Get out!
Have you no shame?
"Is Berta my child?"
"Is Berta my child?"
"Is Berta my child?"
I'm coming.
Bato!
Quiet!
Uncle Blacky!
Natalija is the best!
She is the best!
Franz!
- This is a scandal.
- I know...
Captain!
Good evening, madam.
Captain...
Just a moment.
I am...
Berta's father.
I am the father of your child.
Please...
Do you understand?
Tie us together. Quickly!
I now have my Laura with me.
We're in love.
Hurry!
We're leaving your house so we can live together.
Please don't be angry.
- Finished?
- Yes.
Thank you, captain.
I know this actor.
I know him...
Where on earth from?
Good-bye, captain.
You act for Germans, you motherfucker!
Wonderful actor, my colleague!
Are these the mains?
Keep to your seats!
Hands up, traitor!
Hands up!
Is this the curtain?
It is but please, sir...
Uncle Blacky! Sis!
Uncle Blacky!
Charge!
You want my sister?
Well, you won't have her.
You won't!
Come on!
Hands up, my friend!
They'll kill my brother!
Blow on that horn!
I don't get married every night!
Congratulations!
Okay, Golub. Where's the priest?
I sent a boy to fetch him.
Congratulations, miss.
I'm not getting married!
Yes, you are.
You just don't know it yet.
So, I ruined your life by killing Franz.
Thank you, Natalija!
Who gets Bato's medicine, you or Franz?
- You only bring me stolen gold!
- From traitors.
Come to your senses.
Listen to me...
I've never loved anyone so much.
But respect some rules.
No collaborating with the enemy!
Right!
What do you mean?
I'm just an actress.
The bakeries are working!
Yes, but you're not a baker.
You don't sell pies.
You sell your soul.
I personally will judge those who sell their soul.
First, I'll kill the manager of your theatre.
I'll strangle him with my bare hands... because I love the theatre!
Congratulations, Mr. Blacky!
Will this dinner eat us before we eat it?
Get that fish grilled properly.
No problem!
Have you no shame?
Others help wounded partisans while you perform for the bastards!
It hurts!
So now it hurts you!
I love you.
Golub!
Grill it!
Follow me, I'm going for a pee.
Watch my bride, my friend.
Let's go!
Marko!
Come on! Follow me!
I don't want to!
I don't want to get married!
Golub, I won't leave the partisans to sort you all out.
There's no need.
You may not know this but he's not an electrical engineer at all.
No, he's a common electrician.
A pole-man!
He spent his whole life on poles, with pliers and cutters.
I'm the one who got him down and asked him: "Comrade,
"will you join our side?"
"Yes," he said.
"Will you obey the rules
"and the orders?"
"Yes."
Until... he got rich!
Natalija!
An electrician?
A pole-man!
Natalija, you are our greatest actress and our suffering people need you.
And you need a reasonable, intelligent, educated man...
An intellectual!
You're right!
Comrade Leka will bring you to the disciplinary committee.
We expected the guns a week ago.
Where are they?
On the boat.
As soon as I get married, off we go!
They can hear the music in Belgrade!
Good!
It's Blacky's wedding.
We've had enough crying.
Are these arms or what?
Once the priest marries me,
I'll be at the White Rock before you.
Comrade Tito!
When will you reach Uzice
"Your hands, so white
"So tender, so soft
As the wings of a bird
"Oh, to see them fly and land on my face..."
That's enough!
Get out!
What are you doing to me?
We're just talking about the theatre.
What?
I'll kill myself, I swear!
Don't, my friend!
You know,
I killed two men because of her!
I know.
Why do this to me?
- As for you...
- It wasn't me!
Wasn't you?
It was me, then?
Are you my best friend?
I'm your best friend.
I didn't hear.
Are you my best friend?
I'm your best friend.
Whose wedding is this?
Ours, my love! Our wedding!
Yours, my friend.
- Our wedding, sweetheart.
- Ours, my love!
You wanted a ride, did you?
Well, giddy-up, you stud!
Where's the priest?
He'll be here any minute now.
Is it moonlight at noon
Is it sunshine at midnight
From the skies above
Light is beaming...
The Germans! A catastrophe!
Nobody knows, nobody knows
What is really shining
The two of you could make one good man!
You pest!
Get out of the cars!
Spread out!
Left and right of the boat!
Marko!
Petar Popara!
You fools!
You can't play cat and mouse!
Franz!
Come out now!
And bring Natalija with you or I'll shoot you all!
How come? I killed him.
You didn't.
He wears a bullet-proof vest.
Aim at his head next time.
I'll smoke one more cigarette.
And then my patience runs out.
After that,
I want you out in the open.
Do you hear me?
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Catastrophe!
My sweet saviour!
My dearest...
Schulz, get out!
Now let's send this shit-load of criminals back where they belong!
My little white dove!
Have fun, you idiots!
You won't forget me in a hurry!
Shoot, my friend!
Golub, don't shoot!
Catastrophe!
Shoot, my friend!
Where are the weapons, Blacky?
Where are the trains with the weapons, bastard?
Treacherous swine!
I'll fry Tito out of your head!
Well?
Is he talking?
No. He just keeps cursing.
Petar Popara!
Fucking fascist motherfucker!
You'll talk!
Keep on raising the current.
Marry uncle Blacky, sis.
He's the greatest.
Forget uncle Blacky!
Here's Franz!
Blacky's the greatest!
Stop pestering me.
What did he say?
He asked when he can be released.
Next week, my boy.
He can go to a sanatorium in Austria.
A sanatorium in Austria?
Yes, he'll be safe there.
I can't help him here.
It's too dangerous.
Good morning!
Good morning!
Did the kid vomit during the night?
Yes.
No.
Did he... or didn't he?
I don't know.
Well, he didn't.
Tell him that he must not worry.
Please, tell him...
Burst him!
Burst him like a paper bag!
Let go of him!
Like a bag!
Burst him like a bag!
You killed my Franz!
Is he dead?
Not yet!
Forgive me, Franz. I'm sorry.
Damn your Franz! Come on.
- What's wrong with this shit?
- Put it on level 5.
It might kill him.
Kill me... my ass!
Let me try.
It doesn't work.
Switch it on.
Hey, man, wake up!
Good afternoon.
Let's see what's going on.
What's wrong?
He tested the generator.
Is it working?
Yes, he's dead!
- That one didn't flinch.
- He's an electrician.
An electrician?
A pole-man!
My friend...
Give me a grenade.
If they catch me, I'll choose.
Here you are. Let's go.
Thank you, Marko.
Those crazy people are so sad...
Indeed.
We're all crazy, Natalija.
We just haven't been... diagnosed yet.
Where's uncle Blacky?
In the trunk, my boy.
In the trunk?
In the trunk?
Uncle Blacky!
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
Ivan!
Golub!
Get some bandages ready!
Hang on, my friend!
Bring the bandages, for fuck's sake!
Come and help. Hold Jovan.
Jovan!
Fuck the monkey, help the man!
Pedal faster.
We need more light.
Mind his leg!
God, Comrade Blacky, what did they do to you?
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
Catastrophe!
Jovan...
Comrade Marko!
Call your grandad, he'll cure him.
The water from the well is medicinal.
Gently...
Tell the comrades about the arms.
Don't worry, I'll see to the weapons.
Look at Jovan!
Your son!
This is your dad.
Show him his dad!
Jovan! My son!
Give your dad a kiss!
Kiss your dad!
This room is dedicated to me!
My room!
Right...
Yes!
This room and this house!
And this country and the sky, stars, rain, sun, moon and clouds... even when the sky is bright!
It's all mine...
Yes. All of it!
- Who's bombing us now?
- The Allies.
When it's not the Germans, the Allies bomb us.
Where are you going?
To the cellar.
Come to me!
Come to me!
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you.
Drink up!
You know I don't drink.
Don't be afraid, drink!
It's sweet, not strong!
Indeed...
"I do not know, my dear
If this is a dream
"What year it is
And what day
"And I don't know, my dear
If I am yours
"Or if you are my dream"
Who did you write that for?
Confess!
For you.
You're lying!
You're lying...
I'm not lying.
You're lying.
I never lie.
Never!
Never!
Marko, you lie so beautifully.
Easter, April, 1944
The Allied bombs destroyed what the Nazis had left of Belgrade...
Freedom!
...from our homeland.
They try to tear out part of our body.
With guns, we won the plebiscite!
With guns, we defended freedom!
With guns, we'll defend Trieste!
Part Two - The Cold War
Years passed, Marko became a close collaborator of Tito.
In Belgrade, in 1961, he paid his debt to his great friend, Blacky.
Comrade Marko...
I must ask you again...
Could Comrade Natalija be in the film?
No.
But this film is based on your memoirs and she is our greatest actress!
Exactly. The film is dedicated to the Revolution, not to us.
Will you at least visit the set?
We'd be honoured.
That we will do.
Comrades... it is my honour to inaugurate this Cultural Centre as well as unveil the statue of our Hero, Petar Popara Blacky.
Blacky symbolizes our anti-fascist struggle!
His image and work will forever be remembered by us, his friends, his comrades in arms, and by future generations who from early youth will come to this Cultural Centre to inspire themselves with the ideas for which our brother, our comrade, our friend, our Blacky gave his life and youth.
I'll use this occasion, even if it means taking your time, to quote some lines from my last book of poems on the Struggle for Freedom.
"Why is the wind always blowing when we remember our beloved?
"Why does the wind beat the windows and doors of our brothers?
"Is the wind only blowing or is the sky crying with us?"
Petar Popara Blacky, our friend!
We honour your memory!
We honour his memory!
Is it moonlight at noon
Is it sunshine at midnight
From the skies above
Light is beaming
Nobody knows, nobody knows...
The Soviet divisions are surrounded.
General von Kleist's armoured units have breached their lines...
That's it, girl!
More light!
Dad!
Dad!
Bring some water!
What happened?
Nothing, my friend.
The Gestapo tortured me.
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
Let me go out with you and the war will be over in 3 days.
- Not yet.
- Why wait?
Tito orders you to wait.
Tito?
He said to me:
"Give Blacky my regards and tell him not to move.
"He'll be precious to me in the final battle."
- He said that?
- Every word.
He sent you a watch.
No, Marko, I can't...
With a dedication!
To me?
To you.
Comrade Tito we swear to you
We swear to you
Comrade Tito we swear to you
That we won't abandon your path
Comrade Tito you, the hope of the people
You're loved by the old and the young
Comrade Tito our spring flower
Serbia will not forget you
A blue violet has bloomed
On the pillow where Tito's head rests
Congratulations, Blacky!
Shake hands with Comrade Marko.
Not with me, with Comrade Marko.
Are we having a bath?
Aren't we?
Yes, a bath!
What about our business, grandad?
It's... difficult!
Are you working on the time?
I'm reducing the hours for them as you said.
Six hours per day!
Don't overdo it, okay?
In 20 years,
I've saved them 5 years.
You can imagine what 5 years less in a cellar means?
Air raid! Come on, comrades!
Let's go! Hurry up!
Leave the weapons!
Everybody in the tank!
The aggressor is attacking again!
Don't panic!
Where are you going, you donkey?
Hurry up, woman.
We'll all get killed because of you.
Hurry!
Comrade Tito, we swear to you...
Tito, Tito, Tito!
Everyone sang the same song and believed that outside the fascists of World War II were still in power...
What are you doing, Marko?
You'll see.
Ringe ringe raja
Here comes uncle Paja
And now?
Natalija!
Natalija, Spring is coming on a white horse!
Stop! Cut!
Cut!
Why stop?
What for? Why stop now?
Yugoslav, fuck you and that water!
You call that rain?
Stop! Okay!
Will you ever simply say: act?
When'll you tell me to act?
Thank you, lads. Take a break.
Put the water back on!
Here he comes! Music!
Spring is Coming on a White Horse.
Scene 34a, take 2.
Action!
The Germans!
Natalija, darling!
Spring has arrived on its white horse.
Rape!
No one will catch
Petar Popara, alias Blacky!
Natalija!
Long live the Communist Party of Yugoslavia!
Rape!
Cut! Stop the camera!
Comrade Marko!
Get up all of you!
Stop the rain!
Comrade artists, be happy in your work.
You are portraying... great people who are no longer with us.
We owe them a tribute.
Future generations must remember them.
May you live long, comrade artists!
Music!
Cheers, Comrade Marko!
Comrade Marko... allow me to introduce the heroes of your memoirs.
Get lost! Not now!
Are you me?
Marko!
Yes, I am you.
Unbelievable!
He looks just like me.
Where did you find them?
Casting is half my job.
Really? Unbelievable!
We're cut of the same cloth and swapped our books for rifles.
"Shoot, my rifle, for mother to hear you.
"Never will I abandon my country to anyone."
Well, say hello.
What do you say?
She's so sweet!
Indeed!
Franz?
Franz the vampire.
It's very nice here but I feel someone is missing.
God, is he the real Franz or an actor?
Who knows?
An actor.
Yes, an actor...
Unbelievable!
It's all just like that night...
When you killed 11 Germans, dived into the river...
- What a memory!
...and saved Blacky and Natalija.
Indeed!
Excuse me, please.
Blacky!
My friend!
God, Blacky...
Why did they kill you, my friend?
Why did they kill you?
Can someone protect the actors in this film?
I've been burnt three times already!
Three times!
Comrade Marko, it will be a great film!
Are you afraid of God?
You mean, are we afraid of God?
You'd better learn that text as it's written.
Word by word. Understand?
Sleep tight.
What is this?
What you'll tell him in the cellar.
This?
You know, trash like this, whoever the writer or the director may be, is still trash.
If they ask me what I think, here's what I think!
You're a poet, Marko!
Stick to poems!
Natalija, what's missing?
What's missing?
The truth!
The truth?
Yes, darling!
You know, the truth...
No text, my dear, has any truth in it.
The truth exists only in real life.
You are the truth!
You!
You are supposed to be the truth.
There is no truth, only your conviction that what you act is the truth.
No, art is a lie, a big lie!
We are all liars, a little bit at least.
You scum!
They raped me, beat me...
What else did they do to me?
What?
Does it really matter if those people in the cellar stay alive?
Yes it does, my dear.
You write heroic roles for yourself and I get to play the whore.
Anyone can fuck your wife!
Get dressed and put the make-up on.
I said I'd rescue you in time for the wedding.
Come on, please.
Please, get dressed and put your make-up on.
I said no.
I said no!
I can't act a part
I don't believe in.
Look what they did to her!
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
I love you!
Hear that?
She said she loved me...
What?
Did you hear that?
And you?
She said she loved me.
He's just like me!
Dear friends, welcome to my son's wedding...
Cut it out!
This day has come at last.
My son, dad has bought gold rings.
Give one to your bride.
Do not be offended by the modesty of the wedding meal.
What can we do?
There's a war on.
But everything we offer is offered from the heart!
And if there was no war...
And if the times were any better, and if his mother was alive...
Keep it happy, my friend!
Thank you, my friend!
Comrades...
This is the right moment for all of us to thank Comrade Marko from the bottom of our hearts for all these years during which he has looked after us, fed us and tended to us.
I want to say:
Thank you, my Marko!
Thank you, Comrade Marko!
Sit down!
Last month, we produced
200 light weapons.
Is that nothing?
No, it's not!
Bravo!
Thanks, Marko!
But our greatest success is our tank, the one we made with our own hands!
I am happy and proud of the fact that the time will soon come when we shall use our tank to liberate our country for good!
Tank... forward!
Congratulations, comrades!
Congratulations!
Thank you, uncle Marko.
Whose brats are these?
They belong to us all.
Play, you fucker!
We...
The two of us made this together...
You shouldn't have.
Thank you, Ivan.
Come on,
I have something to tell you.
I need a quick word with him.
Listen... as soon as everyone's drunk, we'll get out to fight.
Not a drop until Liberation!
Marko will be angry.
I've waited for Marko, the Russians, Tito and the Party for 15 years!
The time's never right.
The time is now!
Let's kill the scum and end the war!
That's it, my son!
Let's go!
You little bastards!
Stop drinking, Natalija.
- Give me the bottle back.
- What?
- The bottle!
- I'll give you the bottle all right!
Here!
Stop drinking when I tell you.
I would but I can't look at you when I'm sober.
You can't look at me but you can look at him?
I thought I could but I can't either.
You can't look at him either?
See this?
This is for you.
And this is for him.
I drink brandy and you've been drinking my blood for 20 years, motherfucker!
Natalija, you fucking bitch!
Fuck you and your fucking mother too!
Where's Blacky?
How are you?
Darling! What is it, darling?
You're crying!
Why are you crying?
I don't know.
Are you happy?
Yes, I'm happy!
Are you crying because you're happy?
Is it moonlight at noon
Is it sunshine at midnight
From the skies above
Light is beaming
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody knows
What is really shining
Motherfucker!
What's wrong with you?
My time has come at last!
Cut it out!
You too! Here you are!
I've had enough of both of you!
Enough!
You pathetic little man!
What do you want?
What's wrong, Natalija?
I wasted my youth!
What youth?
Twenty years! Twenty years of my blood-stained life!
This is a catastrophe!
This brandy's good!
It's strong! Real strong stuff.
The monkey's getting into the tank!
A catastrophe!
The gun's moving!
He's moving it! A catastrophe!
Some wine, Natalija?
Shit, I lost!
And I chose the rules.
If there was no war...
Otchy tchernye...
Otchy strasnye...
I'd have been the leading lady of the Moscow State Theatre.
I'd have performed in my mother tongue...
What's this rubbish?
Since when has your mother been Russian?
You're drunk!
Listen to me...
You can't talk to her as if she was your wife!
Understood?
You're absolutely right!
Every good party needs a Russian song!
Without the war, I'd have been the Yugoslav Ma颽kovski.
I'd have gone to his grave in Moscow, bowed and said:
"You were heard from the heavens like thunder.
"We marched along behind you."
Left! Left!
No one will listen.
The monkey's in the tank!
He's smart.
- It's a catastrophe!
- Get lost!
What did you want to tell me?
Something terrible.
So tell me.
Later, I don't want to spoil the wedding.
Tell me, don't worry.
What?
You love Marko, right?
I know that.
- It's not that.
- It is!
- It's not.
- It is!
It's not that. I wanted to tell you this is all a lie.
Our whole life is a lie.
And I can't live without you!
You can't?
Oh, come on...
Music!
Stop the music!
Did you hear what I said?
My son! Listen carefully to what I say.
Never trust a lying woman.
I won't, dad!
You're frightened, Colonel, aren't you?
Stop drinking and talking rubbish!
Frightened?
Colonel...
I'll kill you!
I swear to God I will!
How could you kill me?
I've been dead for twenty years.
Try it. Maybe they'll promote you to Secret Service General.
Stop it!
You couldn't give me a child, so kill me!
Maybe you can manage that!
You're evil!
What am I?
A murderer! A criminal!
A thief!
So I'm evil?
- Worse than that.
- Worse?
Do you know why I'm so evil?
Do you?
Do you know why?
You're damned!
Because I love you.
I love you!
When you fell for me, you put these people down here to live, die and work for you!
Because I love you, don't you see?
I can't live without you!
Do they miss anything?
Yes, a lot!
You dragged me into your crime... because you love me?
Only because I love you!
What else do I have?
Children? Friends?
You have nothing!
I have nothing... but you... if you want that.
My God...
You lie so beautifully!
I never lie!
What are you doing, my... friend?
Just talking.
Talking?
And you have to talk in the dark?
The noise disturbed us.
The noise disturbed you?
The party disturbs you?
- My son's wedding disturbs you?
- You misunderstood me!
I understood perfectly, believe me.
I have a headache.
How surprising!
Look at them.
Give it to me...
My friend... let's break the tradition of a friend killing his best friend.
Here's the gun...
Do the rest yourself!
- You know why?
- I know.
I think it's fair.
I'm a free woman!
A catastrophe!
Now we'll see whose mother will mourn.
Dad!
Jovan, my son!
Get the weapons!
We're going!
Where to?
Outside, to end the war!
The Germans will kill us.
But, dad...
Stop daddying me!
Come on!
We're off to war, not to a brothel!
The Germans will kill me!
Right!
Women and revolution don't go together. Untie us!
Don't cry, Natalija.
We won't be parted long this time.
I'll wait for you!
I'll wait for you!
Soni!
Jovan, my son!
Dad!
Smell the Danube?
I don't.
You really get on my nerves...
Come on!
Dad!
- One question.
- What?
The colour...
You call this green?
Dark green.
You call this green?
Green!
Motherfuckers...
Fuckers!
He hates the colour.
Green!
Fuck your green!
Torturer!
Criminal!
The director is waiting for you!
Keep on pissing...
Keep on pissing!
Not for long...
Not for long!
Hit out, son!
Not me, you moron!
You dare piss on my city?
- Dad's city!
- My city!
Shit!
Madam, where's Jovan?
- They've gone outside. Someone fired.
- They'll betray us.
They won't be able to betray anyone.
They were killed.
Ringe ringe raja
Here comes Uncle Paja
We are at this historic spot where in the year of 19... cowardly criminals murdered our National Hero,
Petar Popara Blacky.
Don't be afraid, my son!
Don't be afraid.
What was that, dad?
A pheasant.
Is it dangerous?
A pheasant? Dangerous?
It's like a wild hen!
There's the sun.
That's the moon, my boy.
The moon.
Where's the sun?
The sun is asleep.
It is resting.
Come on!
Keep down!
I'm just saying that you look so much like Franzi, and Franzi is short for Franz.
Because "i" is the smallest letter.
Here we are!
Franz!
See that blond man, son?
That's Franz.
Look at him.
He hasn't changed in fifteen years.
That's Germans for you!
He tortured you.
And sent Natalija to a camp.
Perfect!
A disguise?
He thinks I won't recognize him.
What's the other one doing?
A collaborator!
Franz!
What's all this smoke?
Sabotage or what?
Let's make the execution look as natural as possible.
What?
Dad, he looks like you!
- Who?
- That one!
The skinny one?
You really get on my nerves!
I could belt you at times.
You're just like your mother.
I don't believe it!
You ask me to act naturally!
- I didn't say that!
- Yes, you did. I'm not stupid.
You did say that.
Honestly...
Come on, don't be touchy!
Honestly, I don't know what I'm supposed to do now!
Hold on!
Is this natural for you?
Honestly, man...
Come and shoot me!
That's it!
Here's the gun and the camera, now shoot me!
The one like you seems very brave.
All brave people look like me.
Are you soldiers or ballerinas?
Look at you!
Come on, roll!
Where's the smoke?
Never there when it's needed!
Get away from me! Now!
Look what he's doing.
He'd stop at nothing!
That's true. But he's the best
I've ever worked with.
And I've worked with quite a few...
He gives us room to improvise.
Get lost! Get away from me!
I can't concentrate!
Tell her!
Get to your places.
"Spring Comes on a White Horse", scene 32a, take one.
Action!
Get rid of that! Get rid of it!
I want to look death in the eye!
Would you like one last cigarette?
Long live the Communist Party of Yugoslavia!
Take aim!
What happened?
That's it! Natural!
That's natural!
Go on!
What do you mean?
We never agreed on this!
Go on acting!
Don't interrupt the shot!
Act!
Call this directing? God!
Long live the Communist Party of Yugoslavia!
Under the leadership of Comrade Tito!
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
Don't interrupt the sequence, you idiots!
Throw it, son!
Charge!
Just like me!
Where's security?
Comrade, you want a ride to West Germany?
I'm looking for my monkey, Soni...
You haven't seen him by any chance, have you?
You're looking for your monkey?
Yes, his name's Soni.
A horse!
Jovan, sunshine, that's a deer.
A deer?
That's how you drew horses.
It's a deer.
Jelena!
It can't be Jelena, sunshine.
Calm down, son, calm down!
What's that?
That's nothing.
Just a fish.
I fished 25-pounders right here before the war.
God, I was really scared.
I was afraid for Jelena.
Don't be afraid, my boy.
I want to go back to the cellar.
Could anyone start protecting us artists?
Could anyone look after us?
We work day and night for our comrades!
And we go through hell!
Calm down.
What do you mean, calm down?
We could've been killed!
You do your job, let me do mine.
I can't do my job!
You must protect my set and my life!
My life was in danger here!
I'll tell you...
I didn't want to in front of him.
He's responsible.
- It's his fault.
- Whose?
The director's.
Shouting all the time:
"Be natural! The more natural, the more terrifying."
And what happened?
He got his natural and terrifying.
Honestly...
How beautiful this world is!
Congratulations!
Careful, dad, you'll drown!
Come for a swim.
Come on, sunshine!
Come on in!
Do you hear me?
Jovan, my son!
Come on!
I can't swim, dad!
Don't be afraid, son.
Dad's here.
Come on, swim!
First your leg!
Then your arm!
First left! Then right!
- I'm swimming!
- Of course, I'm holding you.
Close your mouth!
Where is the kid now?
He really gets on my nerves!
Son!
There is no life for us in this country.
No, my love...
We can't go on living... with lunatics... madmen... psychopaths... maniacs... liars... thieves... criminals... murderers...
Can we?
No, we can't.
We can't, my love.
There.
There's no place for an honest man in this country.
No place at all.
Under the bearing wall!
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Marko Dren's disappearance coincided with the loss of the secret formula of Tito's Yugoslavia.
Tito, having lost his friend, fell ill.
Twenty years later, he died...
Part Three - The War
1992 - Berlin.
Ivan still hoped to see Soni...
Mircovic, where did this marvel come from?
Officially, he's dead.
Dead?
On the contrary, he looks good.
You said officially?
The Yugoslav embassy says so.
A man bearing the same name died in 1941 during the bombing of Belgrade.
He was the zoo-keeper.
Do you know if...
Look what he drew for me.
If he was an Indian, they'd call him
He Who Surrenders.
He told me unbelievable things.
He says he lived the whole time in a cellar.
Communism was one big cellar.
The whole planet is a cellar.
I'm going to Portugal this summer.
Perhaps he could show me an underground motorway.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, Ivan!
It isn't for me!
Why do you cry all the time?
I want to go home to Yugoslavia!
There's a war over there.
A horrifying war!
I know.
Not the war you're thinking of.
In our country, there's only our war.
World War II ended 50 years ago.
And the Germans won.
No, they didn't, they lost.
So why are they celebrating?
You're lying to me, doctor.
You work for the Germans.
You work for them, don't you?
Yes, I work for them but not those Germans.
You're a traitor!
What am I?
A traitor?
I'll show who the traitor is!
I didn't want to show you this but look for yourself.
Who's on these Interpol warrants?
Look.
Who?
My brother Marko and Natalija.
They're wanted by the police throughout the world.
They killed some people in a cellar, traded arms...
The crates were stamped with a monkey.
Your Soni, maybe.
Where are you going?
Ivan!
What's wrong?
He lied to me!
Who lied to you?
My own brother!
Don't do anything stupid!
Ivan, we're not children!
Let's go back!
Come back!
Oh, fuck it!
Stop messing around!
Come back!
Wait for me!
I can't...
I can't go on!
I'll die!
Wait!
Stop, for God's sake!
Which way to Italy?
We don't know. We're lost too.
Where did you come from?
Bosnia. Where are you going?
To Yugoslavia.
No Yugoslavia!
What do you mean?
There's no more Yugoslavia!
Can we come?
Yes, if you pay DM 1,000.
They paid as well.
Ivan, wait!
Let's go to Italy!
We'll eat spaghetti!
We'll drink wine!
Let's go with these people!
What does he mean, no Yugoslavia?
I've had enough, Ivan.
I'm going to Italy or to fucking hell!
I can't go on!
Take care.
Wait!
Wait for me!
Take care, Ivan!
Where... have you been?
Blood...
Has anyone seen my Jovan?
No.
Load!
Fire!
Nowhere to be found...
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!
I don't have time to bargain, to haggle over percentages.
I've come here to help you, independently of our religious, national and political differences.
But I ask only one thing of you: please don't shout.
We'll reach an agreement in a civilized, educated way.
You need me, not the other way round.
Don't worry.
The Serbs kill the Croats and the Croats kill the Serbs.
Don't be afraid.
You're too kind.
Don't mention it.
You're young, kid.
You don't understand.
I do, but you've been abroad too long.
You don't understand our language.
You're asking too much.
Understand? Too much.
I'm asking the minimum.
DM 3 per bullet?
Minimum!
$100 per grenade?
Buy from Hungarians, you fucker!
Ivan...
My brother!
What are you doing, Ivan?
Have you gone mad?
It's a sin to kill your brother!
The greatest sin!
Don't, Ivan!
Forgive me, Ivan!
I saved your life three times.
I saved your life three times!
It hurts! Ivan, don't!
Forgive me, Ivan.
God sees everything, Ivan.
God will punish you.
He'll punish you!
Lord, forgive me.
What are you doing?
My love...
"No war...
"is a war...
"until a brother...
"kills his brother."
My love!
Come on, you old hag!
Young man, this is my husband.
Move when I tell you to!
What are you waiting for?
Get down!
Comrade Commander, we've captured
16 Chetniks, 30 Ustashas and 3 UN men.
Plus two war profiteers with a Mercedes.
What do we do with them?
Profiteers...
Execute them on the spot!
Comrade Blacky!
Pockets searched, soldiers disarmed.
The profiteers' passports...
What do I do with all these people?
Take them to the well.
Any sign of Jovan?
No.
No...
I protest, sir!
Me too, comrade!
I'm no "comrade", sir.
And I'm no "sir", comrade.
What are you?
Ustasha, Chetnik, partisan?
I'm Petar Popara Blacky.
Which army are you in, comrade?
My own!
Do you have a superior?
Yes, my country!
Fucking fascist motherfucker!
Marko, my brother!
Natalija... my love!
I can't find Jovan.
See, my dear monkey.
Who would have thought it?
Nobody.
Imagine that you have a son, a baby monkey.
And someone hides him from you...
And you search for him for years...
But you can't find him anywhere.
Say, isn't that sad?
And what a son I had!
Do you remember my Jovan?
What was he like?
A strong lad.
Just like me!
There is no more sun
There is no more moon...
Did you hear that?
Did you hear?
Jovan!
My son!
Light of my life!
Jovan, my son!
I knew I'd find you! I knew it!
Who organized this?
Mum did.
Here's to you!
My friend!
Did she really have to come?
She's my friend's wife!
Are you crazy?
I know what's what.
What do you know?
I'm not stupid.
They're married!
My friend!
Natalija is a little embarrassed.
Let me introduce you.
Meet my friend's wife!
Pleased to meet you.
Play louder!
That's it, Vera!
Let bygones be bygones.
He's grown so fast.
Look at him.
Big guy, isn't he?
Fifteen years, Vera.
What do you mean, fifteen?
Twenty!
No, fifteen.
- Twenty!
- Fifteen!
Twenty!
I know my own son's age!
My sunshine!
Sister!
Bato! My sweet brother!
You're dancing!
Marko, look, he's dancing!
Look, Marko!
Let's dance together!
Forgive me?
I can forgive but I cannot forget.
Here we built new houses with red roofs and chimneys where storks will nest.
With wide-open doors for dear guests.
We'll thank the soil for feeding us and the sun for warming us.
And the fields for reminding us of the green grass of home.
With pain, sorrow and joy, we shall remember our country, as we tell our children stories that start like fairytales:
Once upon a time, there was a country...
This story has no end...
Chingachgook.
How are you?
The Master of Life is good, John.
Another year passed.
How is it with you?
Getting along.
Yes, I am.
Nathaniel.
Hello, John.
Cleared another quarter, I see.
Yes, I did.
Alexandra.
Welcome.
Jack, how are you?
Hallo, Nathaniel.
How've you been?
Good. Thank you.
Where you boys been trapping?
West of the Cuyahoga.
Why is Uncas with you?
He should have settled with a woman, started a family by now.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Uncas, look.
Mohawk field we saw was five mile long on the river.
Chief Joseph
Brandt's field.
You take much fur?
That we did.
Lots.
The Horicon's near trapped-out now.
Where are you trading your skins?
Castleton?
No.
Schuylerville.
Schuylerville, with the Dutch, for silver.
French and English want to pay with wampum and brandy.
So what is it, Jack?
What brings you here?
French and Indian army are heading south out of Fort Carillon...
...to war against the British.
I'm helping to raise New York's militia to fill the Crown's levy.
And the people here are gonna join in that fight?
We'll see in the morning.
Where're you boys heading?
We'll trap over the fall.
Winter in Can-tuck-ee.
Find a Delaware-speaking woman for Uncas.
She will say, 'You are the one. '
Bear him many children.
Then you can have a boy like me.
Never.
You are too strong.
Turn me old too fast.
That's what he's doing to his mama.
John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality.
Mohawk traded furs with les fran莽ais.
We got no quarrel with les fran莽ais.
Now les fran莽ais bring Huron,
Ottawa, Abenaki onto Mohawk land.
Now Mohawk will fight les fran莽ais and Huron.
I speak for the Twin Rivers
Mohawk of the Six Nations.
His Majesty, King George II, is very grateful for your support.
How far up the valley?
Up to Fort William Henry.
That's two nights and a bit from here.
Should be enough to remind you all that France is our enemy.
France is your enemy.
What did you say?
While we're at your fort, what if the French attack our homes?
What then, Lieutenant?
For your homes, for King, for country.
That's why you men ought to join this fight.
You do what you want with your own scalp.
Do not be telling us what we ought to do with ours.
You call yourself a patriot?
A loyal subject to the Crown?
I do not call myself subject to much at all.
I agree with some of what
Nathaniel and John say, but I believe England's still our sovereign.
I'll go.
We will go to fight the French.
My brother and I will volunteer up.
I'll fight with you, Jack.
I'm staying on my farm.
Any man who goes, his family's welcome...
...to fort up with us till he comes back.
Boys, my sense of it is...
...we have enough here to fill the county levy, and it's a fight we ought to make.
But first we got to get terms from General Webb.
Where are you meeting him?
We'll go to Albany.
Attention.
We speak for the men, not command them.
If they're not allowed leave to defend their farms and families...
...if the French attack the settlements, than no colonial militia is going to Fort William Henry.
They will report or be pressed into service.
Any of the boys worth having...
...can disappear into the forest.
They will be found.
And where does that leave you then?
Those men will be found, arrested...
I cannot imagine His Majesty, in his benevolence, would ever object to his loyal American subjects...
...defending their hearth and home, their women and children.
Does that mean they will be granted leave...
...to defend their homes if the settlements are attacked?
Of course.
You got yourself a colonial militia, General.
It is what we wanted.
Major Duncan Hayward reporting, sir, en route to Fort William Henry and bearing dispatches.
Safe journey, I trust?
Yes, and I didn't experience anything...
...so surprising from
Bristol to Albany...
...as that that I witnessed here today.
And what was that?
The Crown negotiating the terms of service.
I know.
One has to reason with these colonials to get them to do anything.
Tiring, isn't it?
But that's the lay of the land.
I thought British policy is
'Make the world England,' sir.
I see you're to serve with the 35th Regiment of Foot...
...at Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro.
I'll be marching the 60th to Fort Edward.
Explain to the Major, he has little to fear...
...from this General Marquis de Montcalm in the first place, and therefore scent need of a colonial militia in the second, because the French haven't the nature for war.
Their Latinate voluptuousness...
...combines with their Gallic laziness.
And the result is, they'd rather eat and make love with their faces than fight.
Might I inquire if
General Webb has heard...
...from Colonel Munro's daughters?
I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort, sir.
You there, what does Munro call you?
The Scotsman has sent you one of his Mohawk allies to guide you.
Magua.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house.
A company of the 60th will accompany you, and Magua will show you the way.
Dawn. At the encampment, 6:00 a. m. sharp. See to it you're there.
I'll take him for you, sir.
Cora.
Duncan.
How long have you been in Albany?
For days and days.
And yourself?
Just arrived.
By God, it's good to see you.
I don't know what to say, Duncan.
I truly wish they did, but my feelings don't...
Don't go beyond friendship.
Don't you see?
Respect and friendship.
Isn't that a reasonable basis for a man and a woman to be married
And all else may grow in time?
Some say that's the way of it.
Some?
Cousin Eugenia, my father...
Well, then, Cora.
In my heart I know, once we're joined, we'll be the most marvelous couple in London.
I'm certain of that.
So why not let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you?
In view of your indecision, you should rely on their judgment.
And mine.
Will you consider that?
Please consider that.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
Duncan.
By God, you've grown up.
We leave in the morning?
Yes, miss.
I shan't sleep tonight.
What an adventure.
Have you seen the red men?
A few.
I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having been to the wilderness.
It's so exciting,
Duncan.
Alice?
Can we rest soon?
Absolutely.
You, there.
Scout, we must stop soon.
Women are tired.
Not here. Two leagues.
Better water. We stop there.
No, stop in the glade just ahead.
When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Excuse me.
What did you say?
Magua said, understand English very well.
Hold tight.
Come on.
Right. To the right.
Prepare your firearms.
As three ranks.
Make ready.
Make ready.
First and second rank, present.
Fire.
No, Duncan.
In case your aim's any better than your judgment.
Your wounded should try walking on back to Albany.
They'll never make a passage north.
Stop it. Stop it.
We need them to get out.
Why's he loosing the horses?
Why don't you ask him?
Too easy to track.
They'll be heard for miles.
We were headed to
Fort William Henry.
We'll take you as far as the fort.
We're walking out of here fast.
Unless all of you'd rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by.
Scout, I'd like to thank you for your help.
How much further is it?
Night and a bit.
Appears we're well away from them.
Maybe.
Maybe they ain't alone.
That Huron captain back there...
The guide?
He's a Mohawk.
No Mohawk.
He's Huron.
What reason did he have to murder the girl?
What?
The dark-haired one.
Miss Cora Munro?
Murder her?
He never set eyes on her before today.
She's only been here a week.
Blood vengeance?
A reproach or insult?
Of course not.
How is it you were so nearby?
Came across the war party.
Tracked them.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No.
Fort Edward then?
Heading west to Can-tuck-ee.
There is a war on.
How is it you are heading west?
Well, we kind of face to the north, and real sudden-like, turn left.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia.
The militia is fighting the French in the north.
I ain't your scout.
And we sure ain't in no damn militia.
Ottawa, two fran莽ais.
What did you say?
Mirrors, tools, the clothes.
Everything was inside.
They didn't take anything.
And moving fast.
And a war party.
Let us look after them.
Leave them.
Whoever they are, though they're strangers, they're at least entitled to a Christian burial.
They can't be left behind.
Let us go, miss.
I will not. I've seen the face of war before, sir, but I've not seen war made upon women and children.
And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Miss Munro, they're not strangers.
And they stay as they lay.
Why didn't you bury those people?
Anyone looking for our trail would see it as a sign we passed that way.
You knew them well?
You were acting for our benefit, and I apologize.
I misunderstood you.
Well, that's to be expected.
My father warned me about...
Your father?
Chingachgook.
He warned me about people like you.
Oh, he did?
He said, 'Do not try to understand them. '
Yes. And, 'Do not try to make them understand you.
'That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense. '
Why did they turn back?
Burial ground.
'Breed apart.
We make no sense?'
In your particular case, miss, I'd make allowance.
Thank you so much.
Where is your real family?
They buried my ma and pa and my sisters.
Chingachgook found me with two French trappers, raised me up as his own.
I'm sorry.
I do not remember.
I wasn't but one or two.
How did you learn English?
My father sent Uncas and I to Reverend
Wheelock's school when I was 10.
Why were those people living in this defenseless place?
After seven years indentured service...
...in Virginia, they headed out here...
'cause the frontier's the only land available to poor people.
Out here, they're beholden to none.
Not living by another's leave.
The name was Cameron.
John and Alexandra Cameron.
My father's people say that at the birth of the sun, and of his brother, the moon, their mother died.
So the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life.
And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
The stars, he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul.
So there's the Camerons' monument.
My folks' too,
I guess.
You are right, Mr. Poe.
We do not understand what is happening here.
And it's not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London.
Sorry to disappoint you.
No, on the contrary.
It is more deeply stirring to my blood...
...than any imagining could possibly have been.
Top of the next ridge.
The fort's downhill of it.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires, and provide every comfort and desire.
I cannot wait to see Papa.
Fire.
Prepare. Point. Fire.
Open up.
I'm Major Duncan Hayward.
Captain Jeffrey Beams.
Didn't expect you to make it through.
Let's go to Munro.
Hello, boys.
Nathaniel.
I need to talk to you, Jack.
Uncas Thought you and Nathaniel weren't joining up.
We didn't.
Papa. Papa.
Alice. Cora.
Why are you here?
And where the hell are my reinforcements?
Get Mr. Phelps.
Told you to stay away.
Why did you disobey me, girls?
When? How? I...
My letter.
There was none.
What?
There was no letter.
I sent three couriers to Webb.
One called Magua arrived.
He delivered no such message.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Sir, Webb has no idea.
And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements.
What happened to you?
On the George Road.
Attacked.
We're fine.
Are you all right?
Yes.
What will happen here, Papa?
We'll be all right, girl.
This Magua led us into it.
Eighteen killed.
These men came to our aid.
They guided us here.
Thank you.
Do you need anything?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Some food.
Indebted to you.
Miss Cora, how are you?
Hello, Mr. Phelps.
Mrs. McCann will get some dry clothes for you.
Thank you.
Go with your sister, Alice.
It'll be all right, girl.
It'll be all right.
Might I inquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen the French engineering from the ridge above?
The situation is, his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them.
We keep our heads down while his troops dig 30 yards of trench a day.
When those trenches are 200 yards from the fort and within range, he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust.
They look to be 300 yards out.
If they're digging 30 yards a day, you have three days.
Damn. Damn.
This man here can make a run straight through to Webb.
Three days is not enough time to get to
Albany and back with reinforcements.
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the
60th to Fort Edward two days ago.
Webb is at Edward?
Yes, sir.
That's only 12 miles away.
He could have reinforcements here the day after tomorrow.
You, sir, pick your man.
Major Hayward will provide a diversion.
I'll draft out a dispatch.
Captain Beams will seek you out and give it to you later.
Something else. Cameron's cabin.
Frontier cabin.
Came upon it yesterday.
It was burnt out, everyone murdered.
It was Ottawa, allied to the French.
Aye.
So?
It was a war party.
That means they're gonna be attacking up and down the frontier.
Thank you, sir.
People here, Mohawks, settlers, have family out there.
That'll be all, sir.
Things were done.
Nobody was spared.
Those considerations are subordinate to the interests of the Crown.
A terrible feature of war here in the Americas, Major Hayward.
Best keep your eye fixed on our duty, to defeat France.
That hangs on a courier to Webb.
For my children are the children of the true faith.
My friendship and esteem is boundless.
Tomorrow, I will sing the war song with you...
...at the great council fire.
Magua, how are things with your English friends?
We're at one.
Join us.
Hear what Le Subtil has to tell us.
The English war chief, Webb, goes to Fort Edward with 60th Regiment.
He does not know that my father's army attacks Fort William Henry.
Magua was successful?
The other two couriers died in the forest.
By now, Munro would know his dispatch did not get through.
He'll send another.
Grey Hair will try.
Four or five, including two women, entered the fort.
The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's knife.
They escaped.
They will be under it again.
Why do you hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
When the Grey Hair is dead,
Magua will eat his heart.
Before he dies,
Magua will put his children under the knife, so the Grey Hair will know his seed is wiped out forever.
My engineers are advancing the trench through the night.
You may have your opportunity soon.
Miss Cora.
Gentleman looking for you.
Miss Munro.
Hello.
May I?
It will seep, and then it's going to draw.
Thank you, miss.
About done holding hands with Miss Munro?
We got some work to do.
What are you looking at, sir?
I'm looking at you, miss.
Munro refused to believe what happened.
He does not even want to hear it.
Well, he's gonna have to.
Get together by the west bastion.
Ian, Sharitarish, Ongewasgone and William.
Tight weave?
Silk.
Another 40 yards.
And how am I to know it wasn't a raid by common thieves?
The cabin was attacked by a war party fighting with the French.
They're sweeping south down the frontier...
...attacking farms and Mohawk villages.
All the men are stuck here.
I need proof more convincing than this man's opinion, before I weaken the fort's defenses by releasing the militia.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion about the raid.
Taken together, that's gospel.
Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb's reinforcements, not the presence of the colonials.
I judge military matters here, not you.
Your judgment is not more important than their right, under agreement with Webb to defend their farms and families.
Major Heyward was there.
He was at John Cameron's. Ha saw what it was.
What exactly did you see, Major?
I saw nothing that would lead me...
...to the conclusion it was other than a raid...
...by savages bent on thievery.
You're a liar.
Major.
Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman, not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose.
It's their women and children alone on the farms, not yours.
You forget yourself, sir.
We're not forgetting Webb's promise.
British promises are honored, and the militia will not be released, because I need more definite proof than this man's word.
Nathaniel's word's been good on this frontier...
...a long time before you got here.
This meeting is over.
The militia stays.
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?
Has it been replaced by absolutism?
If English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better...
...making their own peace with the French.
That is sedition I
That is the truth.
I'll have you beaten from this fort.
Someday I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
Anyone fomenting on advocating the leaving of Fort William Henry...
...will be hung for sedition.
Anyone actually caught leaving will be shot for desertion.
My decision is final.
Get out.
Cora?
I wanted to talk to you.
Talk with Duncan, Cora.
I must manage.
I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.
Alice.
I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
Cora, when we come together back in England...
...and are married and away from this place, what had to be done and said here will matter not at all.
I'm certain of that.
Duncan, I promised you an answer.
You've complimented me with your persistence and patience.
But the decision I have come to...
...is that I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes...
...than to surrender my own judgment.
Please take this as my final answer.
It must be no.
I see.
Yeah, Nathaniel, but you weren't ever for being here.
That's right.
I saw it that way than and
I see it that way now.
Ian, if I had kin in the settlements, hell be damn sure I'd belong gone.
What do we do about being under Crown law?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us.
All they have over us then is tyranny.
And I will not live under that yoke.
So I will stay here no longer.
Anyone caught leaving the fort could be shot, so each man make your own decision.
Those who are going, be back in an hour.
Out the northern sally port.
Strike for the east side of the swamp...
...till you clear the French picket line.
Head north over the ridge, than come about southeast.
Fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishes.
Should've gotten out of this long ago.
Got no families, Captain.
Figured we'd stay and give a hand.
I'll cover you from the top of the bastion.
You're not coming with us?
I got a reason to stay.
That reason wear a striped skirt and work in the surgery?
It does.
No offense, but it's a better-looking reason than you, Jack Winthrop.
Push hard, 'cause you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.
Good luck, Jack.
Ongewasgone, are you staying?
Yes.
There's too many French.
And so few of us to fight.
Not too many to die. But we've given our word to our English fathers.
You, sir.
As you were.
Stand off.
Take him.
As you were.
He saved us.
We're alive only because of him.
The man encouraged the colonials to desert, in this very room, and in my presence.
Sir.
He is guilty of sedition.
He must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
But he knew the consequences and he stayed.
Are those the actions of a criminal?
Duncan, do something.
He knew the penalty for his actions.
He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
You know he wouldn't send me.
You falsely spoke of what you saw.
What happened at the farm was as Nathaniel said.
But not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
And who empowered these colonials to pass judgment...
...on England's policies in her own possessions, and to come and go without so much as a 'By your leave'?
They do not live their lives by your leave.
They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, bearing their children along the way.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable qualities.
But taken as a whole, I was wrong to have thought so highly of you.
Cora.
Cora, I would do anything I could to keep you from being hurt.
But this man is guilty of sedition...
...and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Justice?
If that's justice, then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for the people here.
You do not know what you're saying.
Yes, I do.
I know exactly what I'm saying.
And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition too.
They're going to hang you.
Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Because what I'm interested in is right here.
What can I do?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.
If they do not arrive, the fort will fall to the French.
If that happens, stay close to your father.
Stay close to him.
The French officers will try to protect the officers among the English.
No. I will find you.
Do not.
Promise me.
The whole world's on fire.
What is it?
Remember what I told you.
Stay close to your father and the officers.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist.
I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
And I yours, monsieur Le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments...
...for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress.
Under the command of a lesser man, it would have fallen long ago, given the superior numbers and materials.
Chance has allowed me to array against you.
Monsieur Le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat.
You called this parley for a better reason...
...than an exchange of compliments.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your prince.
But now I beg you to listen to the admonishments of humanity.
I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Perhaps the general's glass can reach as far as the Hudson...
...and seize the size and eminence of the army of Webb?
My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you.
Capitaine de Bougainville.
'To Colonel Munro.
Sir, I regret to inform you...
'that I have no men available to send to your rescue.
'It is quite impossible.
'I advise you to seek terms for surrender.
'I remain.
Jerome Webb at Fort Edward. '
This is the signature of Webb.
And I know the temper of our men.
Rather than spend the war in a
French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
You've had your answer, monsieur Le Marquis.
Sir, I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many...
...until you have listened to what I have to say.
Go on.
None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge.
They are free, so long as they return to England...
...and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Their arms?
They may leave the fortress fully armed.
My colors?
Carry them to England with pride.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
I have lived to see something which I never expected.
A British officer afraid to support another.
Webb can bum in hell.
And we'll go back and dig our graves behind those ramparts.
Death and honor are thought to be the same, but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.
Sir...
Monsieur Le Marquis,
I am deeply touched...
...by such unusual and unexpected generosity.
My fort is yours under the condition...
...that I be given till dawn to bury my dead, to prepare my men and women for the long journey ahead...
...and to hand my wounded over to your surgeons.
Granted, monsieur.
Is the hatchet buried between the
English and my French father?
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My master owns these lands, and I have been ordered to drive off the English squatters.
They have consented to go, so now I call them enemies no longer.
Magua took the hatchet to color with blood.
It's still bright.
Only when it's red, then it will be buried.
So many suns have set since
Magua struck the war post.
And where is that sun?
Magua is the son of his people...
...and he has come to lead many of them.
But Magua has power with his
Huron people and others here,
I know well.
Magua's village and lodges were burnt.
Magua's children were killed by the English.
I was taken as slave by the Mohawk who fought for the Grey Hair.
Magua's wife believed he was dead...
...and became the wife of another.
The Grey Hair was the father of all that.
In time,
Magua became blood brother to the Mohawk to become free.
But always in his heart, he is Huron.
And his heart will be whole again on the day...
...the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
I fear having let them go, which I must,
I will only fight the same men again when I drive towards Albany.
But I cannot break the term of the surrender...
...and sully the lilies of France.
Monsieur, the fort is yours.
Left three ranks, make ready.
Aim, set.
Fire.
Present, fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Full company.
Grey Hair, before you die, know that I will put under the knife your children, so I will wipe your seed from the Earth forever.
Leave her alone.
When you fall into British hands again, I'll have you hanged.
Faster.
Head to the river.
Where are we going?
- - Nowhere.
I don't understand.
This is as far as we go
If we're lucky, they'll figure we beached...
...our canoes and headed cross land.
If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Our only hope is that they pass us by.
If they do?
Take the south rim down the mountain.
It's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
And if they don't?
You'll just have to forego the pleasure of hanging me.
Powder?
Gone.
Mine's soaking wet.
Our father...
Did you see my father?
From a distance.
Say nothing to Alice.
Get back.
Yes. Go ahead.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
I want you to go.
If we go, there's a chance there won't be a fight.
There's no powder.
If we don't go in that, there's no chance.
None. You understand?
Coward.
You've done everything you can do.
Save yourself.
If the worst happens...
You stay alive.
If they don't kill you, they'll take you north up to the Huron lands.
Submit, do you hear?
You're strong. You survive.
You stay alive, no matter what occurs.
I will find you, no matter how long it takes, no matter how far.
I will find you.
I don't speak Huron.
Do you speak French, Major?
Yes.
Translate for me into French every word as I say it.
I come to you unarmed and in peace to unstuff your ears, Sachem.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free.
Take fire out of the English anger...
...over the murder of their helpless ones.
Sachem, the French fathers made peace.
Magua broke it.
It is false that the French will befriends still to the Huron.
Would Magua use the ways of les fran莽ais and the Yengeese?
Would you?
Yes.
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy...
...and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?
Would Huron have greed for more land than a man can use?
Would Huron fool Seneca into taking...
...all the furs of all the animals of the forest...
...for beads and strong whiskey?
Those are the ways of the
Yengeese and the fran莽ais traders...
...and their masters in Europe infected with the sickness of greed.
Magua's heart is twisted.
He would make himself into what twisted him.
I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese.
Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook of the Mohican people.
Let the children of the dead Munro...
...and the Yengeese officer go free.
This belt, which is a record of the days...
...of my father's people, speaks for my truth.
Tell him I'll trade him.
Me for her. Say it.
Stop it.
I am La Longue Carabine.
My death is a great honor to the Huron. Take me.
Did you tell him?
Yes.
Stop.
I said to take me.
Take me.
My compliments, sir.
Take her and get out.
Duncan... What are they doing to Duncan?
Where's Alice?
Alice.
Uncas.
Great Spirit and maker of all life, a warrior goes to you swift and straight...
...as an arrow shot into the sun.
Welcome him, and let him take his place...
...at the council fire of my people.
He is Uncas, my son
Tell him to be patient and ask death for speed, for they are all there but one,
I, Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans.
* Mad about the boy *
* I know it's stupid *
* To be mad about the boy *
* I'm so ashamed of it *
* But must admit the sleepless nights *
* I've had about the boy *
* Walking down the street *
Excuse me. Excuse me.
So where are you from?
Mudgee.
A country girl.
I knew it.
How?
They're always shy.
You blushed when
I asked you to dance.
I did not.
It's just hot.
Have you a boyfriend?
Yes.
Oh, no, no,
I had one, but he's in Egypt or somewhere.
Egypt? Well, forget him.
He's probably chasing some dusky maiden...
'round the pyramids by now.
Know what they call this dance?
No idea.
The Crush.
Do they?
Well, I'm not really complaining.
You're so beautiful,
Rosemary.
So are you.
You can't say that, can you?
Men aren't--
I am not beautiful.
Yes, you are.
* I'm feeling quite insane and young again *
* And all because
I'm mad about the boy *
We've got everyone
Churchill can spare.
Thousands of bloody
Australians... drinking the place dry.
And all to fight tiny little...
Japanese chaps wearing spectacles.
They're all cross-eyed, you know.
Can't aim their damn guns.
At night, they can't see at all.
Do they all have white sticks and guide dogs?
Phyllis, it's true.
Really.
Cyril, remember that
Japanese gardener we had?
He had glasses as thick as--
The bottom of a gin bottle?
Yes.
Man: It's certainly a fact their weapons are useless.
My Godfather! All they can make are tin toys... and cameras that don't work.
If you don't mind me saying so-- even if you do--
I don't think
I've ever heard... such a total load of poppycock.
They've conquered most of Asia.
And those "little
Japanese chaps--"
You heard of a place called Pearl Harbor?
My dear, Topsy,
Adrienne,
Pearl Harbor was a surprise.
A sneak attack.
We're all ready and waiting for them.
I hope you're right.
[ Indistinct,
Talking Under Music ]
Thanks.
Ooh, that one come on a bit strong, eh?
Sort of. He's nice.
I just don't reckon he's got too much upstairs.
Come on, Oggi.
It's what they got downstairs... that really counts.
* A little magic that would finally *
* This dream that pains me and enchains me *
* But I can't because
I'm mad about the boy *
How's that son of yours,
Pargiter?
Where is he?
Westminster?
Robbie, what was that?
Just target practice,
I expect, my dear.
Target practice, at night?
Mmm?
Celia, run upstairs and get my wrap, will you, dear?
You're wearing it,
Mummy.
Oh, so I am!
I was just confused.
* And enchains me, but I can't *
* Because I'm mad about the boy *
* Mad about the boy *
Pardon me, please.
* I'm mad about the boy *
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm sorry to disturb this evening's entertainment, but I have some rather unhappy news.
The Japanese have now crossed the Jahore Strait... and have broken through our lines.
And their guns have the city in range.
As you can hear.
But, Colonel, only today, the Straits Times reported... that the Japanese were being driven back.
I'm afraid, sir, the only true thing you read in the newspapers is the cricket scores.
Now, don't worry.
This hotel will be perfectly safe.
Why?
As I'm sure the Japanese high command... will want to stay here... and avail themselves of the facilities.
The city will fall within a few days.
All European women and children... are to leave immediately.
He can't mean us.
They're going to need us.
All soldiers to return to their units.
Good luck.
Well, now we know.
They can see, which we were told they couldn't.
And they can fight, which we were told they couldn't.
And they're here, which we were told they would never be.
Stop it, sir!
It's just up there.
Are you all right?
Come on, girlies.
Just leap down.
That's it.
Nurse: Thanks.
Take cover!
Now, this isn't quite... what I had planned for us.
Oh, really?
I should have sent you home months ago.
Well, at least Charlie will be surprised.
I wouldn't have seen him until your next leave.
Woman: Good evening.
Nice night for the collapse of an empire.
Come on, now.
Before you know it, we'll be back in Portsmouth.... sailing. You are a great outdoor girl, Rosemary.
That's one thing
I love about you.
And indoors? I thought you liked me indoors.
Indoors?
Mmm.
Oh, yes.
What rubbish!
Are you aware that my husband... is the head of Singapore--
He could be the King of Bongo Bongo, but you can still only take... one suitcase on board. That's it.
Oh, Celia, come along quickly.
Seaman:
Gangway stowed!
Mrs. Roberts:
Take care, Robbie.
Bye, Daddy.
Ropes away!
Take it to the end of the wharf, Chee Wan, and push it off.
Yes, sir.
Damned if I'll have some bloody Japanese officer driving it about.
Lifejackets on.
Do them up, nice and tight.
Just ask us if you don't know how.
I'm glad to help you, ladies.
Woman: Thank you.
Lifejackets on, please.
Just let me know if you need any help, miss.
So, what's going to happen to the men, do you think?
Woman: With us out of the way, they're probably already tucked up... with their Malayan girlfriends.
It seems so ridiculous, shoving us out at the last minute.
It seems now they should have... shoved us out months ago.
Oh, in all fairness,
Phyllis, we could have gone.
I think we chose to stay.
Tea?
Thanks. You're all Australians.
That's right.
We've been in Singapore for 2 months.
Now that they must really need nurses, you're leaving.
Phyllis!
Oh, no, it's true.
It's ridiculous.
I was a secretary at Army H.Q.
I saw the reports on what the Japs did to the nurses... in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Seaman: Lifejackets on, please.
Do them up, nice and tight.
Oh, oh, don't go!
Lovely.
He can wait.
He'll still be there.
Seaman: Lifejackets on, please.
Give them back!
I haven't taken them.
Oh!
It's really quite simple,
Mummy. Look!
Like this.
Boy: Just give them back!
Here, let me do it.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Mrs.--
Merritt.
Topsy Merritt.
Of course, the American.
Your husband runs the pineapple canning factory.
That's right.
Give them back!
I don't got them!
Perhaps the boys could be restrained a little.
I know... the conditions are somewhat unusual, but this is my cabin.
Your cabin?
It's my cabin.
I understood that Marty arranged this cabin for me.
My husband is an engineer... with coastal traders.
Mine is the head of the P.W.D.
Mine's in pineapples.
Look, girls, we're just going to have to get along.
It's only 5 weeks.
Oh, God!
Oh, very good.
Seaman: Keep your lifejacket on, please.
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me, ladies.
Uh, how much longer... do we have to wear these lifejackets?
A few minutes now, lass.
Once we're 11 hours out of Singapore, we're out of range of Jap fighters.
But the goddess Hera, the wicked stepmother, was so jealous of Hercules... that one night she crept into his room... and put 2 deadly snakes in his cradle.
But he was--
What's that?
Hard to starboard!
Aah!
Seaman: Abandon ship!
Turn sideways, Mummy.
Sideways!
Don't reckon she's got a sideways.
Are we sinking?
Yes, that's right, dear.
We're going to jump into the water, and it's going to be lovely.
Oh!
Take cover!
Get down!
Tommy!
Tommy!
Come on, children.
No, thank you, dear.
I'll stay here.
The ship is sinking,
Mrs. Roberts.
Hello, Mrs. Roberts.
Remember me?
Rosemary
Leighton-Jones.
We met at the cricket club?
Oh, oh, of course, dear.
How are you?
Some other time, maybe.
Yes.
Just take my hand,
Mrs. Roberts.
We'll jump together.
Of course.
Woman: Get in the raft!
Get a place in the boat!
Could be worse,
I suppose.
Do you think so?
Well, the water could be cold.
That's true.
Must be Sumatra.
Yes.
It's amazing how everyone's just disappeared.
It's like one of those girls' adventure annuals... my mother gave me every Christmas.
It's an adventure I could certainly do without.
They always had happy endings.
Oh! Now I'm cold.
If you spend a penny, it'll warm you up.
Huh?
We used to swim in the North Sea... in our school hols.
It was freezing.
We always did it.
Oh!
It's working.
I'm starving.
Yeah, me, too.
Rosemary Leighton-Jones.
My husband is
Dennis Leighton-Jones.
Royal Malayan Volunteers.
How do you do?
Susan Macarthy.
Australian Army
Nursing Corps.
Adrienne Pargiter, wife of tea planter.
How do you do?
Hello.Yeah.
You are English ladies.
Yes.Yes.
Australian.
Ah, yes.
I was for some years in Singapore.
I was a, uh, newspaper correspondent.
May I ask what you ladies are doing here in Sumatra?
Our ship was sunk.
By your planes.
We swam to shore.
What can I say?
Except that attacking the enemy... is a characteristic of war.
The Prince Albert was full of women and children, not soldiers.
A matter of regret.
More than that, there's a Geneva convention... laying down the rules of war.
Japan has signed no Geneva convention.
If a war has begun, it can only mean... the time for rules has ended.
The aim is to win.
Good luck.
Up until you reminded him of the Geneva convention,
I thought we were going to be invited to dine.
Oggi!
Susan! Susan!
How-- How did you get here?
Jap navy boat picked us up.
What were they like?
Oh, gentlemen compared with this lot.
English Empire
Number 10.
Nippon Ichiban,
Number 1.
Hai!
I am Colonel Hirota.
And uh, I am in command of this--of this place.
Days of British and Dutch peoples... exploitation of Oriental people all finish.
Now they exploit
Oriental people.
You Europeans had great
"proudry" and arrogance.
Think Oriental people inferior.
Situation now
100% reversed.
Colonel,
I'd like to know... how long you expect us to remain... in these perfectly--
Aah!
Woman: Take it all to the kitchen, please.
Please, bring everything to the kitchen.
Not so bad, really.
Woman: Uhh!
Disgusting.
At least it's food.
I went to an English boarding school.
I meant by those standards.
It's funny. In the kitchen, there seemed so much.
What do you mean?
Well... How do we know they're dividing it up fairly... those Dutch?
Oh, come off it.
They don't speak English.
Well, I think the food that you saw... had to be divided up among over 400 people.
That's correct.
It doesn't go far.
I don't know that the Dutch are noted for their cooking.
No, not like the English people.
All I can say is,
I hope this is over... very, very soon.
When our boys get here, it'll be just a few weeks.
Your boys? What about our boys?
Frankly, I don't care which boys do it, just as long as we're going home.
She's right. Any boys will do me.
Thought they might.
I've heard they're sending all the noncombatants home.
What do you think about that, now?
Where did you hear that?
Oh, just around and about.
We're all noncombatants,
Mrs. O'Riordan.
No. I mean like me.
See, I'm Irish.
We're neutral.
There's
2 Portuguese ladies.
And you... well, you're...
I have a German passport.
Well, then...you're on their side, aren't you?
So you think.
Already I have escaped
2 madmen in Europe.
Now I'm catched by the oriental version.
You're from Singapore.
I don't think we've met.
I don't think.
The English don't invite Jewish refugees... to the cricket club.
My husband and me, we are doctors in Asian hospital.
Oh, you're a doctor.
That is what I say.
You like perhaps...
I send to Leipzig for the certificate?
Oh, no. I--
Anyway... they're sure to let you go.
No. Japanese men don't like lady.
Call Japanese lady zashiki bita.
Means "old pig in back of house."
Sounds strangely familiar.
I--I was in China when the Japanese invaded, and I think the people they despised most... were Europeans, then prisoners, then women.
Well... that's us.
All three.
Quick.
You see man before?
Well, no.
Only here.
So, you know, some little Oriental men... big like this.
And some big
European men... like this.
You never can tell.
Really.
Mm-hmm.
Bugger!
And I thought being a secretary... was a rotten job.
What if they do win the bloody war?
They'll have us doing this forever.
They're not going to win.
We'll win.
The British don't lose wars.
Yeah? I reckon if I'd paid attention in school,
I could think of a few.
They tell me you are a model.
Oh, yes, it's true.
I think that you're very beautiful.
Yeah.
You have been to Paris?
Many times.
Ohhh... wonderful clothes and... the lovely people.
The elegance.
In Singapore, did you model?
Oh, no. I was visiting my husband there.
Oh.
I'm modeling next season for Hartnell's in London.
London! Ohhh...
Well, I hope I am.
Ja.
You know, you could do some work, Mrs. Tippler.
In this heat?
We're all supposed to work if we're not sick.
You're just lazy.
Lazy
You.
Ohhh...
I'm completely... buggered.
Phyllis!
Well, I'm sorry.
There's simply no other word for it.
I'm buggered.
You know, this place sure ain't Alcatraz.
We could be under that fence... and into that jungle... before you could say "boo."
Well, don't forget to write, Topsy.
You would die in that jungle. It's full of snakes.
Boa constrictors.
Horrible.
Yeah, well, after 3 months in this place... it doesn't sound so bad.
The locals will betray you.
The Japanese have got them all terrified.
That's right. Some of the men escaped, and they brought them back.
They cut off their noses and their ears, and they hung them upside down, so they did.
How awful.
All the loose change... must've fallen out of their pockets.
They'd have hated that.
But it's true!
Yeah, well, you've convinced me.
This place ain't so lousy.
Room service is a bit slow.
Mmm.
What men,
Mrs. O'Riordan?
That guard.
You know, the one that looks like the actor.
Mr. Moto.
He's in all those...
Japanese detective films.
Peter Lorre.
Mr. Moto. Yes,
Mrs. O'Riordan, but what men?
I was telling you.
That guard was saying... there's a camp full of men over the hill... just a few miles away.
Now, they're Dutchmen,
I think.
But he says there are some from Singapore.
Oh, Hudson insisted on growing... masses and masses of red carnations.
Woman: Ooh, lovely.
Hey, Dr. Mizushima.
Get me some quinine, eh? And some bandages... and morphine und a stethoscope.
Even some aspirin is good.
Just Mercurochrome.
Mercurochrome. I know.
I-- You Japanese think it cures everything.
Then you give me some cigarettes, eh?
I'm a German, your ally.
I'm not one of these
British colonialists.
Uhh. Only Japanese?
Taste like cow dung.
How she is?
Oh, Doctor... can't get her to eat anything.
I think it's just... uhh... too much for her, really.
For a lot of them.
They don't adjust, they die, my dear.
How many gone since we come to this wonderful place?
Oh, 4.
Not so bad.
Be worse by Christmas... with the bad food and no medicine.
Christmas?! The war will be over by Christmas.
Don't you bet your fuddler on that one, my darling.
What's a fuddler?
I think I can guess.
Oh, fuddler.
Do you think she's really a doctor?
What do you mean?
Well, who'd know? She certainly got herself... out of working in the field--
Shh!
...and cleaning out the lavatory.
Buck up, Phyllis.
It's Christmas.
Where's the champagne?
The plum pudding
Oh, it's lovely,
Adrienne.
Perhaps now might be a time to deal with that dog.
He'd make a nice stew.
It's only a little dog.
It don't eat much.
Yes, but he does eat what we could give to the children.
But how will Mrs. Roberts cope without him?
She's right, Edna.
It'd be the end of her.
I think... this must be the servants' quarters.
Tell Chen Li... only to come when we call.
Mommy, that's not Chen Li.
That's Wing.
Aiya...
Malaria bad.
So sorry. Yes.
We can't get any quinine?
I think she's been stealing... the sugar again, dear.
You have to watch these Chinese, Robbie.
I get quinine.
[ Shouting

Not so young no more.
Quinine?
Oh. Thank you.
Did they see you?
I think maybe no.
Ohhh...
They catch them?
Can't tell.
Here you are,
Mommy. Take this.
That black market could get us all into trouble.
They warned us. They'll cut our rations gain.
She's right.
Here, Mommy.
This can help.
Wait! Wait!
[ Man Shouts
In Japanese ]
What is it?
There's no more gin.
It's sake.
Japan drink.
Very strong.
You no like?
Mmm. I wouldn't say that.
Look who's here.
Kempei-Tai.
What's that? Sounds like a Chinese dish.
Would be better. It's
Japan's secret police.
Ho!
Oh!
Oh!
Ohhh! Oh! Oh!
Uhh!
Ohh!
Ho!
Uhhh!
Wing.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Aaah!
Aaah!

"The brilliant sunshine filters through the trees.
"The leaves are rustled by a gentle breeze.
"A wild and open space,

"A hush enfolds me,

"A jungle clearing.
"A track... through which we bear our load to Him."
It is our Paradise Road.
How silent is this place.
How sacred is this place.
[ Women
Speaking Dutch ]
One would think they would've learned... a few words of English by now.
They understand a lot more than they let on.
Oh. Wait a minute.
I want my soap.
Where's that soap?
Soap?
Soap?
Soap. Soap.
Ah. Ah.
What else?
Nay.
Nay.
Don't give me that.
I was here. Right there!
I had to write an I.O.U.... for £5 for that soap, and I want it now!
Ladies! Ladies!
Please!
Calm down!
What is this?
So you think they took your soap?
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Well, I bloody well think so.
Maybe we should just have a look... in their ugly bloody dresses or their silly wooden shoes.
Ladies.
See soap.
Ohhh...
Elgar.
What?
You were humming the Elgar Concerto.
[ Hums Notes
From Concerto ]
Do you know I went to the very first performance.
Felix Salmond.
Leeds, 1920.
That was almost my last concert.
The church sent me to China a few months later.
But... I mean, you're not a musician, are you,
Miss Drummond?
Your poem. I assumed you taught English.
Oh, I taught a bit of everything in China.
But... I did study music at Durham.
Miss Drummond... would you care to take a turn with me... in the gardens before lights out?
I'd be delighted,
Mrs. Pargiter.
Oh. I'm so sorry. I've interrupted your prayers.
Oh, perhaps, it's just as well.
I was about to ask God... to smite Captain Tanaka and the Snake... with a severe case of dysentery.
I studied music at the Royal Academy... under Sir Henry Wood.
What did you play, the violin or the viola?
The violin.
How did you know?
Just a guess.
You were humming... the Symphonie Concertante the other night, and that has leads for both instruments.
Yes.
I came out to Singapore with my father, and I met my husband William, who's an absolute darling, but music was fairly low on the list of priorities... for Singapore society.
Very low, judging by the stories I've read... by Mr. Somerset Maugham.
Oh, well... if you've read him, you think we do nothing but drink G & Ts... and murder one another and indulge in ceaseless--
Wife swapping?
What will they think of next?
Do you know,
Miss Drummond,
I feel I owe you an apology.
Me
My-- My snobbery.
We never mixed with missionaries in Singapore.
We were taught to look down on them.
Oh, what a tedious lot, most of us, and very self-righteous.
You're not serious.
Not really. Well... maybe just a bit.
Oh, dear.
Back we go, or the head prefect will be after us.
Do you know,
Mrs. Pargiter,
I've just had a wonderful idea.
An orchestra?
You're crazy.
Do you expect the Japanese would give us instruments?
Not at all,
Harriet.
I thought I'd made that clear.
We don't need instruments.
I don't think so, Adrienne.
After what happened, no one's in the mood for a sing-along.
But that's just the point.
I don't think it's such a bad idea.
Do you read music,
Mrs. O'Riordan?
Read it? Didn't know you could read it.
But I can sing it all right.
I was in the choir at school.
I think it's a harebrained idea, Adrienne.
We hardly have the strength to talk.
You want my advice, you'll forget the whole thing.
You think the Japs will agree?
Not on your Nellie.
They have forbidden any meetings... or religious services.
We can't even have classes for the children.
You must have perfect recall, Miss Drummond.
I envy you.
They say Mozart could play any piece... after hearing it only once.
But I'm cheating. I know
Dvorák back to front.
It's probably full of mistakes.
I don't think so.
It's rather complicated, isn't it?
You'll have your work cut out for you... when you conduct it.
I'm not conducting it.
You are.
Me?
Well, you trained at the Royal Academy.
Yes, but I was a violinist, and that was years ago.
Miss Pargiter, you read music.
And Sir Thomas Beecham isn't available.
Uhh--
After tea, we will go--
Use "shall."
"Shall" is more refined.
...shall go to the member's stand... and vatch the--
And watch.
And watch the gentlemen play the cricket.
Yes!
What are we gonna sing?
I love
Rudy Vallee.
It won't be
Rudy Vallee.
Mrs. Roberts, what about you?
Oh, my dear,
I was a stalwart... of the Cathedral
Choir of Singapore, and my husband Robbie was--
You have a lovely voice, Mummy.
Well, perhaps
I should consider it.
Lovely.
I'll put you down.
Tan, Millie, you've heard about our choir.
You'll join us, won't you?
What kind of people will be in this group, dear?
Mummy!
What's wrong?
I simply asked... what kind of people would be in this group.
People like us, Mommy.
Prisoners of the Japanese.
But that's irrelevant, dear.
One has a certain position.
I mean, one can tolerate the Dutch, some of them, but--
Mummy, I--
What is it, Celia?
Try to finish your sentences.
Do you remember Wing?
Well, of course I do.
Horrible business.
Horrible.
But who knows what kind of contraband... she was trading in?
I mean, probably some Oriental--
Quinine, Mommy. She'd gone to get quinine for you.
You know what
Colonel Hirota said... about writing anything.
They find that, they could execute the whole bloody lot of us.
Perhaps we're all being put... in a precarious position, Adrienne.
Perhaps.
I happen to think... it's worth risking.
Oh!
The Japanese will only find out if somebody says something.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Somebody tells them every time one of us... rolls over in bed.
You've always got plenty of cigarettes.
Do you think that--
I've never heard anything so insulting.
Well, someone told them it was Wing... trading outside the fence that night.
Well, it certainly wasn't me!
What about that Jew doctor?
What-What about that one?
Always making eyes at that bloody guard.
Susan, Mrs. Tippler, that's enough.
S'truth! You were always... the shyest little thing at nursing school.
Maybe nobody there ever got my goat.
Well, then.
Who's first?
Um...Mrs. O'Riordan?
If you would.
* Ah *
[ Hums Scale
Slightly Off
Thank you.
And...
Mrs. Cronje.
Mrs. Cronje, would you, please?
* Ah *
[ Hums Scale
Confidently ]
Quick. Hide it.
Aah!
Oh, God.
Eh, I reckon... she's gonna be all right, Mrs. Roberts.
She might have... a bit of a funny bark.
Thank you, dear.
Thank you so much.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Tillie, come and have some water, dear.
[ Continues,
Indistinct ]
You okay?
Okay.
No, not so okay, but I breathe, so it's not so bad.
I think you might have a touch of malaria.
I might be able to get some...quinine.
I'll get some whiskey.
Cures everything.
So, after the war, darling, you go to medical school, yes?
Me?
Yes, you. Why not?
You know, my father'll want me back at the station.
He never even wanted me to go into nursing.
Station. He is a railway master?
No. I was--it's a sheep station.
It's like a farm.
You do what you want, darling... not what your father want.
He get plenty of those big Australian men... to work on the station.
So. The Japanese end the ladies' choir... before it even begin.
Oh, not at all. And it's a vocal orchestra, not a choir.
But you can't possibly go on with it, not if they won't let everybody meet.
It's only the large group that attracted the Snake's attention.
You don't give a damn about us... the whole camp.
I beg your pardon?
Isn't all this just so you can lord it... over the rest of us, boss everyone around?
The whole thing might be a bit... grandiose, Adrienne.
I mean, how many women conductors... are there, anyway?
None that I know of.
Well.
Well, then this is probably a first; something to be proud of.
No. Excuse me, Mrs. Roberts, you were late.
Oh, I don't think so, dear.
Yes, Mrs. Roberts.
You must watch me.
I was watching you.
Perhaps everyone else was early.
No, Mrs. Roberts.
Once again, everyone.
* Ah *
Hai!
Hai!
[ Shouting
In Japanese ]
Aah!
Oh!
Ohhh... boring man.
[ Shouting
In Japanese ]
Aah! Oh!
Ohh!
Is there something we can do for you, Sergeant Tomayashi?
Huhh!
"Conner... Griffin... Munn."
Well, it isn't just our orchestra women, is it?
No.
I can't see what it means.
Do they have something in common?
Some of the Dutch girls are on here, too.
Well, repatriations?
Executions?
You're there,
Rosemary.
And Susan and Topsy.
I know. God, what else could they do to us?
It says the main gate after tenko.
We'd better not go.
We just won't go!
Just say you have another engagement.
Mistake. They'll do something awful... if we don't go.
I know what this is.
What?
This is all the younger girls-- all the more attractive ones.
Am I on there?
No!
No!No!
This is Japanese
Officer's Club.
This is Japanese officer men.
Most were educated and refined.
Some speak English... like Englishmen from Oxford.
What rubbish.
Japanese officer look for volunteer... to work in club.
Volunteer have plenty of food... and satin sheet.
And we're the acceptable volunteers?
That is correct interpretation.
Disgusting, is what I call it.
I'd rather kiss a leper from Leopoldville... before I let any of that lot touch me.
Well, we don't have to stay.
They're not forcing us.
Right.
Our own satin sheets?
Ladies who stay in beautiful house... will please to walk in direction indicated.
No. You can't be serious.
Too right I am.
You know bloody well... we've got
Buckley's chance... of getting through the war... in that camp.
You think
I want to end up... in some shallow grave... in Sumatra?
The war's going to be finished soon.
You said that over a year ago.
Bett!
Bett!
Hot water. Ahem.
Is there hot water in this club?
Plenty hot water.
Plenty soap.
Soap!
Soap!
It's been so long.
Oh...
Topsy, don't be absurd.
Japanese officers gonna be any worse... than most of the creeps we've all known?
Probably.
What about Marty?
Well, what he don't know--
Then what about the vocal orchestra?
I'll be an alto short if you go.
Are you asking me to give up food and soap... and God knows what else, so I can starve and sing?!
Yes.
I suppose I am.
Lady... please.
A good Catholic sister like you.
I just can't believe you're not more--
Censorious?
I'm not their judge.
If they want to survive, maybe they will this way.
The will to survive is very strong, stronger than anything.
I just can't believe what you're saying.
Very well, Phyllis.
I've just lost four sopranos in that lot.
You're going to have to join us now.
I'm not interested in your bloody choir.
Well, you could stop lying around and whinging... and jolly well get interested.
Well.
What about you two?
Oh, no, not me. I--
Susan?
Look, to be honest,
I don't like the kind of music you're doing.
It's got no tune.
You really don't know... what you're talking about.
No?
No.
All right, now, altos, it's two notes.
* Mmm *
* Mmm *
* Mmm *
All right?
Ahem.
* Mmm *
* Mmm * Yep.
How many do you have today?
Two. I found them both just staring up... like this.
Just wait till
Mrs. Van der Weyden dies.
She's so big with beri-beri, it will take 10 women... just to carry her out of the hut.
Yeah. We'll have to jump on her... to get her in the coffin.
Dr. Verstak?
Yes. Over here.
So, how it goes, the English ladies' choir?
I can't tell.
Lots of starting and stopping, it seems.
Not much singing.
You sound very disapproving.
Oh, but I'm not.
It will keep the ladies busy, and that is good, but the noise they will make !
It is not for someone... who's heard the great choirs of Leipzig... and Vienna.
What are you doing?
You're pulling out their gold fillings.
Quite right, my dear.
They are of no further use to their owners.
You should not be so squeamish... with all that you have seen.
I think this takes the cake.
So this is how... you get your whiskey and cigarettes.
That is so, and the small amount of medicine that we have.
How do you think we get that, the Japanese give it to us?
I trade with the guards.
Ah!
Amazing how strong.
Anyway, it's best you know all this... in case something happen to me.
What do you mean?
I should carry on doing this?
Only if you want some of the ladies in the camp... to stay alive. Ah!
So what do you sing?
Oh, um... it's all stuff
I've never heard.
Oh, uh, some...
The
Dvorák?
Yeah.
They sing Dvorák?
Yes, that's it.
You don't know Dvorák?
What? They don't teach you anything in Australia?
Only about sheep?
Aah!
Aah! Uhh!
I have perhaps seen you before.
I think not.
I think so.
The insolent lady to whom I gave a ride.
Japanese soldiers never attack women.
You refused to bow to him.
He struck you on the face, quite rightly, then you struck him.
No. He was drunk.
I could smell the sake.
He grabbed me from behind--
Silence!
Uhh!

Colonel Hirota say incident with the lady... most regrettable, but is death for strike Japanese soldier.
Lady have very bad manners.
Manners very important to Japanese people.
[ Speaking
Japanese ]
That is all.
You're starving and beating woman and children.
You steal our Red Cross parcels for yourselves.
You don't give us any medicine for the sick, not even the quinine for the bloody malaria everyone's got.
You make us work like slaves.
You don't even let us write to our families, and you have the cheek to sit there... and lecture us on good manners!
Tomorrow, lady will be executed.
Please, please!
You tell Colonel Hirota that I saw what happened.
The Colonel knows that I'm a nun, and nuns never tell lies.
The lady only raises her hands... to protect herself.
Like this, and then she hit him by accident, and he fell back into the latrine.
Colonel Hirota say he regret, but the incident all dealt with by Captain Tanaka.
Captain Tanaka with Kempei-Tai.
So Captain Tanaka is in charge of this camp?
I understood it was you,
Colonel Hirota.
Two broken ribs is not so bad.

I have some medicine.
Come.

Whiskey?
I love whiskey.
I'm a nun, not a saint.
And you, are you a saint?
No, no. That would make me fall over.
Oh, I've never drunk whiskey before.
Let us hope that you do worse things... in your life, darling. Prost.
Bottoms up.
Prost.
Faith, you can do very little with it... and nothing without it.
Cheers.
Yes, Japanese whiskey, not scotch.
Still, we can't have everything.
You got some lipstick?
Orange?

Look!
Oh!

Oh, gee, it's been a long time since I kissed a man.
There's nothing nicer.

Then we meet no one.
We shall not meet anyone.
Shall.
But we won't stay here.

[ Speaking

Sorry.
When you say to Captain Tanaka... that all wars end, you tell him that perhaps the invincible Japanese army... will lose this one.
Who knows?
And if they do, his treatment of this young woman... will not result in the Allies... building any shrines to him.
Maybe they even hang him.
Yes.
I do not think you are in a position... to threaten
Captain Tanaka.
Not a threat.
Advice only.
I'm his ally.

Do you know,
Miss Drummond,
I just realized I don't know your Christian name.
It's Daisy.
I've always hated it.
I wish to be called
Margaret.
Well, then,
Margaret it is.
Why not?
A gift... from Colonel Hirota.
Soap.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, this will go a long way among 300 of us.
Colonel Hirota say you will please to sing... one Japanese folk song.
Tell him no.
Oh... but this is very difficult to say.
Tell him my appreciation of the Japanese culture... is at a low ebb.
I think I make some other reason.
As you wish.
You don't hate them, do you?
Why not?
I've tried, but I just can't... bring myself to hate people.
The worse they behave, the sorrier
I feel for them.
Are you comfortable,
Mrs. O'Riordan?
I'm all right.
Gently.
No go!
Boys no go!
Too big.
Go men's camp.
What?
No!
Mom, please!
It'll be all right!
Don't let anybody push you around.
Ugh!
So, Mr. Tomio... where are we going now?
Yes, what's happening?
I don't know.
I think you do know.
No, I don't.
Tell us something,
Mr. Tomio.
Be a man.
General MacArthur back in Philippines.
Chase Japanese soldier all over place.
Try it.
Ohh!
I always wanted to be an engineer, but my father wanted me to be a nun.
Don't worry.
I love God, even though I sometimes wonder what he's doing.
Here.
Arigato.
If my guys are coming, why don't the Japs just go... and leave us here?
I don't think they've ever done anything... that made much sense.
It's the satin sheet brigade.
I knew I should've joined that bunch.
I think maybe we all should've.
Up there is the mountains of Loebok Lingau.
My father would take us there... in the summer.
In the jungle, there are many tigers.
At night we close all the windows and doors, or they come in the house.
I lie there and I hear them... walk up and down the verandah.
Pom, pom.
So heavy they are.
I can hear them breathing... through the other side of the shutter.
One morning,
I opened the door... and a big tiger is sleeping on the front stoop.
Oh.
Ahh.
I spent my summers... at my family's home in Dorset.
No tigers.
Just rain.
Soft days, we called them.
That's where
I met Dennis.
We were 17, and he was my school friend's brother.
I thought he was the best-looking boy...
I'd ever seen, but it took him so long to kiss me,
I thought it was never going to happen.
And then it did?
Oh, yes!
Ha ha ha!
We were in my father's study.
I nearly fainted.
We were so young, they didn't want us to see each other, so we pretended we weren't in love.
So you keep seeing each other?
Oh, yes.
We didn't fool anybody.
I realized love is like a flame.
It burns and is visible to all.
Ah.
Be careful.
Are you all right?
Is Susan here?
Ugh!
If I ever get out of this,
I'll never say a word against New Jersey.
You'll never get out of this.
None of us will ever leave Sumatra.
Come on.
A little towards me.
That's it.
Snake!
Aah!
Where?
Snake.
Kill it.
We'll eat it.
Aah!
Don't give up now.
Dennis vouldn't want that.
Wouldn't.
Rosemary, remember, we are going to Lord's... to watch the gentlemens play cricket.
Then we have some tea.
Snake's not so bad.
The grasshopper's delicious.
Wonder what
Bing Crosby's up to now.
Bing Crosby?
Why?
I miss him.
That's all.
Beaut he is,
Bing Crosby.
We must get the orchestra started again.
We've got to have a rehearsal.
Oh.
Yes, of course,
Margaret.
Show the Japanese we're still alive.
Still got some spirit left.
That bloody choir.
Totally exhausted everyone.
They won't be able to find enough people now... for a barbershop quartet.
Oh, shut up, Harriet.
Shut up?
You were bullied into joining by Adrienne.
That's true.
Best thing that ever happened to me.
Here you are, Mummy.
Mummy, you have to eat something.
No, dear.
I really don't mind dying.
No.
I learned a great deal in the camp.
I did nothing, you know, in Singapore.
Mummy, you're not going to die.
Yes, dear...
I am.
I'm really sorry that I won't see... your dear father again.
I have so much to tell him.
So much.
Doctor.
Rosemary.
The beautiful
English girl.
Paradise Road.
Tomorrow... perhaps tonight.
Sometimes God reaches down... and pulls the wings off his butterflies.
Wh
She doesn't want to live anymore.
Perhaps now she realizes the world is not a place... where lovers are reunited and good always wins.
She saw her husband at the railway yard.
The great love affair.
I can't say I'd pine away after any of my husbands.
If I fall in love, then I hope it is like that.
Good luck, my dear.
"Father, in captivity...
"we would lift our prayer to Thee.
"Keep us ever in Thy love.
"Grant that daily we may prove...
"those who place their trust in Thee, more than conquerors may be."
"Give us patience to endure.
"Keep our hearts serene and pure.
"Grant us courage, charity, greater faith, humility."
"Readiness to own Thy will, be we free or captive still."
Amen.
All: Amen.
Amen.
What are you doing?
The French eat snails, don't they?
Yes, but I think those ones will make you sick.
I'm here, Margaret.
You can't die now.
Not now.
She's asking for something.
"The Lord is my Shepherd.
"I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness...
"for His name's sake.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley...
"of the shadow of death,
"I will fear no evil,
"for Thou art with me.
"Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
"Thou preparest a table before me...
"in the presence of mine enemies.
"Thou anointest my head with oil.
"My cup runneth over.
"Surely goodness and mercy will follow me...
"all the days of my life,
"and I will dwell... in the House of the Lord forever."
That's what I wanted.
Amen.
The war... is over.
Who won?
Once more... we can be friend.
I have done my best for you.
I know... not enough.
But I could do no more.
Woman: We weren't number 10.
Oh, Tillie!
Does this mean... it's back to picking up groceries, laundry, and all that? My God!
For you, my dear.
For me, it is luxury hotels... and limousine cars.
Yes.
Dr. Verstak.
Yes, Macarthy.
Are you really a doctor?
Yes and no.
My husband is a medical doctor.
I'm Doctor of Philosophy.
I hurt no one.
Maybe I help.
Is wanting to survive so bad?
Susan.
Dear Susan.
Well... we made it.
Yes, we did.
Some of us.
I can't believe it!
[ Vocal Orchestra Performs
Londonderry Air ]
IN TIME LIKE THESE ESCAPE IS THE
ONLY WAY TO STAY ALIVE...
AND TO CONTINUE DREAMING.
MEDITERRANEO
They send us on a mission on
Mighisti, a remote Aegean isle... the smallest and most distant one.
It's strategic importance was zero.
Our orders were to observe and make contact.
We were to occupy and report.
The men assigned to me came from... here and there. Survivors from lost battles... men from disbanded regiments.
A platoon of misfits like myself, who had happened to survive.
Eliseo Strazzabosco, the mule-driver was a strange guy.
He'd spent the whole war with his
Silvana. He'd brought her from home.
He loved her like a person.
Maybe even more.
Hey, Strazzabosco!
"La Dolce Vita", eh?
A honeymoon in the Aegean.
And tonight...
Pretend you didn't hear.
Don't give them the satisfaction.
There were the Munaron brothers,
Libero and Felice.
Two mountain boys who had never seen the sea.
And there were Lo Russo and Colasanti.
You got anything to drink?
Lo Russo ha reached the rank of Sergeant
Major in the African Campaign.
What might he have become by the wars end? Colasanti, the signalman...
...lived in Lo Russo's shadow practically in symbiosis. Then there was Corrado...
...Noventa, the deserter.
He'd already escaped a few times, trying to get home.
His wife was pregnant.
Last time they caught him...
...between Albania and Yugoslavia, trying to walk home to Italy.
My attendant, Antonio Farina, was very devoted to me...
...always ready for orders, at times even anticipating my thoughts.
- How much longer, Lieutenant?
- Not much.
- Will there be shooting?
- Let's hope not.
We were all at the age where one hasn't decided whether...
...to start a family or lose oneself in the world.
Lieutenant, how long do we have to stay here?
Four months.
Damn!
Silvana, don't make a fuss.
Don't make me look bad in front of the Sergeant. Calm down, relax!
Try to take deep breaths.
In... and out... and in.
Good start...
- What's the problem?
- We cannot swim.
- Munaron!
- Give me the radio.
- Take it easy.
- There is a pit.
Be careful with the radio, guys.
Can I get some help with Silvana?
Come on now! Could you not left that damned donkey home?
Greece exports donkeys all over the world!
Shall we put on our gas masks at once, sir?
- No, no masks. C'mon.
- Why'd we bring all this stuff?
- She has become lame.
- What do you mean?
- At disembarkation.
- Lieutenant, what's written there?
- Greece is the tomb "ton Italon".
- What does "ton Italon" mean?
All right, men. We'll all advance very quietly inland.
Keep your eyes open. Strazza, at the rear. Colasanti, in the middle to...
...make sure the radio is safe. Once on top, we'll establish a base. Understood?
Yes, but what does
"ton Italon" mean?
"Of Italians."
- Meaning?
- "Greece is the tomb of Italians."
There's nobody here.
Your head's burning. You're hot, eh?
- Hell!
No objections? I'll go in.
This time we agree?
Not a fucking soul!
There's nobody in this town.
Are you crazy?
Didn't you see me? It's me, Farina.
Excuse, me! You almost killed me!
- We heard a shot, so we fired.
What the fuck is going on!?
Who oppened fire?
- Farina did, Lieutenant!
- He had oppened fire, so we fired.
Wait! Lieutenant, I saw the hole thing.
Farina got attacked by a chicken and reacted. The men, taken by surprise...
...thought we were being attacked by Greek chickens.
Stop fooling around!
You could have killed him!
- It hadn't been a big loss...
- Stop joking.
I was only joking. I meant better a dead chicken than...
It was just to keep up the morale of the troops. You're a bunch of idiots!
- Sorry. I didn't meant that.
- It doesn't matter. I was hot.
- Where have all gone?
- I don't care.
I cannot care less.
I remember a similar thing in Africa.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
A patrol went out on reconnaissance.
They found a deserted village where they stopped to sleep.
Following morning there were only bones left.
- Whose bones?
- Patrols. They were eaten.
- Everyone. What savages!
- What's that nonsense?
- It's not.
- But we are not in Africa now.
There should be no cannibals here.
How would you know?
How would you know what Greeks eat?
The monastery, call's the Savoy, over.
Reply if you can hear me, over.
- How is she, Strazzabosco?
- She has pain in her hoof.
The flag is up, Lieutenant.
- Monastery, call's the Savoy, over.
They fled when they saw us coming.
They haven't left a single boat behind.
- Monastery, call's the Savoy, over.
They fled in the mountains and will attack us during the night. A classic one.
The monastery, call's the Savoy, reply if you hear me, over.
- Try to keep your eyes open, guys.
- I have a contact!
Hello? The monastery here. Can you hear me, Garibaldi? The mission is completed.
No losses. No contact with the enemy.
The situation is under control.
We are awaiting new orders. Over.
Top priority. Top priority.
Orders from the Naval Headquarters.
We are on a mission.
From now on we cancel all radio contact. Over and out.
Colasanti? Colasanti?
- Well?
- Nothing.
Guys, you have to behave properly against the Greeks.
There are no cannibals here, but they once took a soldier...
...and hung him by his feet's and poured hot olive oil in his ass.
- How?
- With a funnel.
Goddamn!
You are lowering the troop's morality.
No, I tell you, not to do any nonsense.
Can you pass me the chicken?
- What did you do before the war?
- I was unemployed...
...I have studied. Then I was unemployed, and I started study...
...again but then, I quit. And you?
Teacher of skiing.
No comments!
Felice? Do you see anything?
Me neither.
- Look, Libero!
- Wow! Make a wish.
Hope that we all may return home safely.
Yeah, so do I.
Who lives in hope, dies in shit.
Says Lo Russo, on a meaningless island in the Aegean Sea in 1941.
I am also an author. Good night.
- Sergeant-Major!
- What is it?
- Good night.
- Go and shit.
One doesn't smoke on guard duty.
Fuck off, Strazzabosco!
If they spot your cigarette, they can shoot you in the forehead.
What are you smoking?
Milit.
Give me a drag.
I scared you, huh?
- What's happening?
- Did you hear? Look!
Alarm!
Libero!
- Who the hell yelled?
- Farina gave the alarm.
Move it!
Come on, hurry!
- What's happening?
- Look there!
We're kicking their asses, eh?
Lieutenant, our side is really beating them!
R. N Garibaldi.
Lieutenant, I hear something but it's mostly static.
- I'm connected...
...here, Lieutenant.
- What do they say?
- Wait.
...contact with enemy affected.
What about our man?
Where are they?
Wait, I don't understand.
...two units sunk...
- It's the British.
- They're speaking English.
... repeat no survivors.
Lieutenant, tell us, too.
-I don't know!
How come you don't know?
What are we going to do now?
Boys, I don't know!
I understand.
Everyone in position! Maximum alert!
No relief.
The Brits could land any minute.
Understood?
Move it, on the double!
Stay here Silvana, its dangerous.
Come on!
Stop, who goes there?
It's me, Lo Russo.
- Password.
- It's me, I said.
- Identify yourself. Password?
- I told you, it's me, Lo Russo.
The password, or we shoot.
All right...
"Savoy or death".
OK, Sergeant, you may proceed.
OK, my ass!
Counter password?
"Memento audere semper."
No, you're wrong.
- "Lightning!
- No!
- That's was yesterday's password.
- "Pizza Margherita!"
Sure! And Four Seasons!
- It's "Queen Margherita"!
- Yes, it's "Queen Margherita".
We're supposed to conquer Greece with these four idiots?!
Tomorrow I'll turn you all in.
Understood?
- Go take a shit!
- Who said that?
Who?
Show yourself! Bastards!
I know who that was.
I recognized him. Ass-face!
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me? It wasn't me!
Two days' punishment for all and four days for ass-face!
Quiet!
What's that?
The British, I feel it.
Who goes there?
The password!
Identify yourself, or I will shoot.
Lieutenant, if it's you, say so.
There!
No! Don't shoot!
Silvana!
My Silvana.
It was Silvana, boys, but...
But I gave you specific orders...
- You said to shoot, and we obeyed.
- No. I said, "Stop, who goes there?"
"Identify yourself or I'll shoot."
Calm down!
- Calm my shit!
What happened here?
Lieutenant, I said, "Identify yourself or I'll shoot." These guys fired.
Strazza, it wasn't our fault.
Bastards!
- No!
- Easy!
- Bastards!
This morning the chickens, now the donkey! How will we carry the stuff?
- The radio!
- Shit! My radio!
Silvana...
- Broken?
- I don't know.
- Can it be fixed?
- I don't know.
- Why don't you know?
- I said I don't know.
It was our most important equipment!
To be kept in top working condition!
We depended on it, and then that creature of a mountain man broke it!
Don't yell. Blaming him won't help now. Stay calm.
Calm, my ass! Stay calm, my ass!
We're cut off from the war!
How do we communicate now?
With smoke signals?
My Silvana...
We have to keep dignity.
To show some combat spirit!
Sing! C'mon! You, too!
Don't be like that?
Show me some spirit!
At least a little bit!
Let's go!
There's nothing here.
Ok. Boys, you'll stay here.
For observation and liaison.
When you see a ship, send up the signal flares. Toward us, not them.
In two, three days
I'll send another shift.
Don't worry about us. We're not too familiar with the sea.
If the relief shift isn't obligatory, we'll stay here.
We'll come to get our supplies.
- Suit yourselves.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, one second.
Munaron.
The mission "C" is now documented.
See you.
ITALY, I THINK AND DREAM OF YOU.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning.
Some ghost island!
- An island of ghosts. There's nobody here.
- The radio?
- Any news?
- I've reassembled it. It won't work.
I put him in the kitchen.
He has been a chef.
He is a master in cooking eel in tomato sauce.
Lieutenant, he is a master in cooking eel in tomato sauce.
Good. You made right in.
I am a little worried about the boys.
Nothing is going on.
Strazzabosco is always alone.
And now Silvana is dead.
Besides, he is a gay.
There is nothing wrong with that, but we have regulations.
- Why?
- Because he is among the soldiers.
Because he lives among men.
Alexander the Great, also, although he was a great warrior.
- He was a gay, too?
- Sure.
But it was in the ancient Greece.
It was so long ago.
But here we have regulations.
Homosexual relations are forbidden.
"Punish all homosexual relationships within the squad."
It is clearly written here.
So let's invent something to boost their morale.
We could have them dig a nice trench.
- What for?
- Nothing. They'll dig it and cover it up.
- They'll get demoralized.
- Let's simulate an attack.
- In this heat?
- Then what can I do to...
The weather is hot.
- Listen, Lo Russo, think of something.
Now excuse me. I have to update the military diary.
I didn't realize...
Nothing is going on, and he updates a diary?
What is he writting?
- Farina, are you married?
- No.
- Engaged?
- No.
- Is anyone back home waiting for you?
- My folks died when I was little.
I never knew them.
It's nice here, right?
Well...
This may seem like an arid place, a place for sheep... but here, 2,500 years ago, before Rome, there was a beautiful civilization.
There were poets, philosophers, warriors, goddesses.
We're all their descendants. Even you can find your origins here. Understand?
Do you like poetry?
It depends.
Look... these were written seven centuries before Christ.
You know how to read?
- Not in Greek.
- Each poem is translated.
The mountain peaks sleep, along with the valleys, cliffs and gorges...
and creatures of the brown earth...
I like to be alone.
I feel better when I'm alone.
When I was a kid, I was afraid of darkness. And emptiness.
I was horrified when I was left alone in a dark and empty room.
A fear of vampires, snakes, heights...
These are all normal fears.
This is a strange island.
The silence is everywhere.
But this is not a normal silence. Even if you do not want a silence, it is here.
We are cut off from the world on this island.
We are cut off from the life.
Our boys are already in Russia.
They are in Moscow, already drinking vodka, having women and eating caviar.
And we are here. I would rather be in the middle of a battle!
In the middle of a battle?
- This is like being out of a battle.
If you're in a battle, you can not stay aside.
I'm going to sleep.
-Sergeant. -What?
Good night.
-Shit.
Wake up! They've arrived!
I saw them! They're here!
Lieutenant, wake up!
- What happened, Sergeant?
- Where did they land?
- They're everywhere! Many of them!
- The British?
No! I tried catching one, but they disappeared.
- Who are they?
- Children.
Strange, isn't it?
There are no men.
- Just old men and children.
- It's fishy.
- It could be an ambush.
- I remember similar situation in Spain.
- Sure, sure!
- Not again!
Well, don't complain to me later...
Madame, hello.
The men... the soldiers, where are they?
She still has a papa?
You can speak Italian to me.
I spent twenty years in Roma.
Italians... Greeks... my face, my race...
One face, one race.
Father, where did all of you go?
Why wasn't anyone here when we arrived?
The Germans were here before you.
They destroyed all the houses and sank the boats.
They took all our men away... deported them.
When we saw your ship, we thought they had come back.
So... we hid.
I know the Italians well.
We don't like strangers in our country, but... it's lesser of two evils.
I assure you, we'll create the least possible disturbance.
I'd advise you to move into the Mayor's house.
You'll be more comfortable.
Where are you going?
We're friends!
Friends, friends.
Wait! Come here!
Regulations prohibit fraternizing with the locals.
The first one who touches woman, hen or rooster... will be court-martialed.
Understood?
Why are you always shouting?
Help us instead.
Sergeant Lo Russo shouts whenever he wants to because... sergeants shout.
Is that clear? Is that clear?
A fine hand!
I'm just an amateur.
This man reminds me of the picture of Homer in my school textbook.
For the first time since I left home I feel good.
You're strange, you know?
You don't seem like a soldier.
I was mobilized. In peacetime
I'm a high school teacher.
- Did I speak it right?
- You speak Greek very well.
I learned Greek through books.
The Iliad, the Odyssey, the poets.
I teach about Greece but I've never been here. With my salary...
Who knows. Maybe this is destiny.
Maybe I'm asking too much... but... have you seen our church?
It's badly damaged.
Would you consider... painting... the walls?
I'd be honored but I'm not good enough to paint frescoes.
Of course you're good enough!
For free, of course.
Sergeant, I found some enormous peppers.
For your backache I'll fix a board for your bed.
I'm also fixing up a piece of leather...
Be careful!
Leather...
- How will you cook the peppers?
- Stuffed.
Sergeant!
Hi, Noventa.
- Guess what I've got.
- A letter.
Yes, to my wife.
I'll leave it with you?
Yes, I'll send it.
- It's important. How long will it take?
- Like the others.
- I didn't put a stamp.
- No problem. You can go, Noventa.
Thanks.
- You've seen the lieutenant?
- No.
- The lieutenant's not here?
- No.
There's a woman outside asking to talk to the commander.
- The lieutenant isn't here?
- The lieutenant's painting frescoes.
We're sweating here, he's in a cool church.
Should I show her in?
If she wants to talk, show her in.
If not, she can stay outside.
Lo Russo... beautiful.
She's beautiful.
That's her.
- Good morning.
- You're the captain?
Yes, I am.
- I'm Vassilissa. Vassilissa.
- Vassilissa?
- Yes.
- A beautiful name.
I'm Lo Russo...
Nicola.
- I speak... for "Duliam".
- I don't know "Duliam". Sorry.
You don't?
Ergassia, you understand?
Do we know Ergassia?
Duliam Ergassia?
- Work! Work!
- Work?
You want to talk about work?
What kind of work do you do?
I'm a "puta".
- "Puta" is Greek for...?
- A whore.
- Stop that, please!
- Yes! Right! Whore! Yes.
Good.
Good... I mean... there are different ways of saying the same thing.
You're interested?
I have to glance at the regulations...
- but we're very... we'd be interested.
- Fine.
And where... let's say... do you conduct your... where do these...
- manifestations take place? The house?
- My house.
- Your house.
- The blue house... blue.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Off on Thursday.
Friday, Saturday, double shifts.
Sunday: Day off. Understood?
- Why not alternate days?
- Because this is what I decided.
The order is based on age and rank.
So, I'm first.
- The lieutenant's first.
- He doesn't go to prostitute. I'm first.
Then Colasanti, then Noventa,
Strazzabosco and then little Farina.
- And the two brothers?
- The damn Munarons!
Mind your own business!
I'm asking for a volunteer to call the two brothers up in the mountain.
Without a volunteer, the brothers stay where they are.
Speak to me of love, Marie.
All my life, it's you.
Your lovely eyes are shining
Like two stars, they twinkle
- Sergeant?
- Thanks, dear.
I destroyed her.
Tell me you're all mine.
Instead of reading poetry, sing!
You'll stop being afraid.
Here, under your heart,
I'm no longer suffering.
Bye.
Vassilissa...
Miss Vassilissa.
Vassilissa!
Farina, get the ball!
- She won't give it to me.
- Get going! Get it!
Thanks.
Alarm flares from the Munarons.
Call the Lieutenant!
All civilians in their homes!
The enemy's here! Hurry!
Who is it? The British?
I don't see anyone yet!
Lieutenant, Lieutenant.
- You signaled the alarm?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
It's a ship with a red flag.
- Shit! The Russians.
- The flag's not exactly Russian.
- It's more like Turkish.
- Yeah, Turkish.
- Are the Turks on our side?
- What kind of ship?
- Like a fishing boat.
- A fishing boat.
You signaled about a fishing boat?
- We were told to report anything...
- You did well. It could be a spy.
There he is.
Italians... Turks...
One face, one race!
I think it isn't only tobacco.
Say what you want. There's something else in it. Not just tobacco.
The smoke of oblivion.
Like in the Odyssey.
Odyssey.
It tastes like sage.
Tell me, do you have other stuff?
Opium... cash...
No, I meant rugs and such things.
No rugs, no rugs.
Lieutenant, rugs, cash, opium, who gives a damn! He doesn't know anything.
- What's happening? What is going on?
- Where?
Where else? In Italy... in Europe!
- Dunno.
- What "dunno"?
I mean Mussolini,
Hitler, Germany!
- Dunno!
- What?! Where did you come from?
Cash... Antalya... Fatie... no war.
- Let's confiscate the boat.
- Why?
To go to Rhodes, to Italy.
- To where things are happening.
- Do you care that much?
Yes! We're in this God-forsaken place.
We don't know what's happening anywhere.
Aren't you curious? I say, let's go to the front where there's action.
Fine... let's vote.
Whoever agrees with the sergeant to confiscate poor Aziz's boat... to face a very dangerous journey to Rhodes for two days... without any certainty of arriving, raise your hand.
Whoever whishes to stay, raise your hand.
I don't vote because of my rank.
We stay.
What kind of voting is that?
We're staying on the island of oblivion.
Smoke some oblivion!
It was a rigged voting.
Did you ever think we'd end up here?
Did you eat chicken with your finger?
You pipe's glued to your hands.
Pass it around!
- What's chicken got to do with oblivion?
- They both stick to your fingers.
I think this stuff is prohibited in Italy right now.
Why?
Under Fascism everything good is prohibited.
- Would you, Emperor, legalize it?
- Who, the raisin?
- What raisin?
- What are you talking about?
- As Emperor...
- Sergeant Lo Russo.
No guard duty... Savoy, eh?
To the boat!
I don't agree.
With the sloppy and relaxed attitude that prevails among you.
Being a comrade, I can't go in against the tide...
I can't go against the wishes of the majority.
I also understand your rebellious attitude toward authority because of...
- the absolute negligence of the state.
- What the fuck are you saying, Lo Russo?
What are you saying?
I'm saying what I'm saying.
I too feel... abandoned by my country, by Italy.
And I don't give a shit!
And I'll say it again!
They left us here, and here we'll stay!
They said, "You'll manage", and... we're managing.
- What are they saying, Aziz?
- Dunno.
You always "dunno".
You dunno nothing!
Hi, Aziz. Friend... friend!
Take me home!
Take me along! Friends!
Italy, Turkey... one face, one race!
He stole everything! Everything!
Now what! We stay here like a bunch of idiots.
Never trust the Turks.
Hell, don't laugh, Father!
We don't even have a weapon.
How can we occupy the island?
Come with me.
Come with me.
We've had weapons all the time.
We're friends, right?
Why won't you make love with me?
- Because.
- Are you embarrassed?
What's the most beautiful thing on earth?
Some say a swarm of knights, others say infantrymen, yet others say ships.
I say it's the one I love. And then it continues. A Greek poet wrote it... over 2,000 years ago.
Yes, but why won't you make love with me? Why?
- I've never done it.
- Never?
But...
I want the first time to be for love... for true love, you understand?
Life isn't enough...
One life isn't enough for me.
There aren't enough days... too many things to do, too many ideas...
Every sunset upsets me because another day has gone by.
Then I'm moved, because I'm alone... a tiny dot in the universe.
I'd like to watch sunsets with my mother... or with a woman I might love.
I'd like to spend the nights alone... alone, or... maybe with a beautiful slut which is better than alone...
Did the Turk leave any of that stuff?
"Dunno" was his name.
Thanks.
If things were always this way... if they took your weapons and left this stuff, we'd live better, right?
- Come on, come on.
- We're coming.
- You go first.
- No, you go.
- No, I won't go!
- Go!
You know what Father always said?
"If necessary, float on shit."
- I'd like to see him!
- Ready? One, two, three...
Vassilissa, what about this?
Mine.
- A gun in your kitchen?
- For the enemies.
- May I ask you something?
- What?
I've been waiting to ask you...
No, no, nothing. Never mind.
Go ahead. Go on.
How come you're a...
How come you're... a...
- Prostitute?
- Yes.
My mother is a prostitute.
My grandmother's a prostitute.
My sister's a prostitute.
Logical, isn't it?
Logical... logical.
What did you do before?
Where were you?
Why did you come here?
- Here?
- Yes.
In Athens I worked with the Germans.
The Germans brought me here.
They left.
I stayed.
The end.
- You like it here? You want to stay here?
- I don't know.
It's fine here... for now.
But you'll... you'll always, always be...
A prostitute?
I...
I... I don't know.
Maybe I'll open a tavern.
- It's a massacre! Penalty!
- I didn't hurt him!
- Lieutenant, fuck off!
- You fuck off!
Calm down!
Now... it's a penalty.
On two conditions.
One: That you do the kicking.
Two: That I do the blocking.
I'm hypnotizing you!
It's already blocked!
The pepper got you, eh?
Go on!
Kick!
It's been 15 minutes!
I hypnotized you, but...
Don't show me where you'll kick...
It's already blocked.
Move away!
What the hell?
My God!
He's Italian. He's one of us.
- Italians?
- Lieutenant Raffaele Montini.
Sergeant Nicola Lo Russo.
Lieutenant Carmelo La Rosa.
Anyway, I saw it. There was no penalty.
You are Italian soldiers?
I had engine trouble, nothing serious, just a coupling.
I'm headed for Crete. Our division was united with the British.
- The British?!
- Sure! They have... some incredible planes! The British and the Americans are very organized.
British and Americans?
Did you surrender?
Who?
You don't know about anything!
Not even September 8th?
So what? Every year there's
September 8, 9, 10...
What about September 8th?
- How long have you been here?
- Since June.
- June of what year?
- '41, '42... '43... Three years?
- What?
You've been here three years?
Hear that? Three years.
He's been here three years!
- We've all been here three years!
- All of you?
We arrived together.
Then you know nothing?
You have no radio, or anything?
- We had one.
- I'll explain it all. Mussolini fell.
Italy is divided. South, the British and Americans.
North: The Germans and Fascists.
In between the CLN.
- What's the CLN?
- National Liberation Committee... the partisans. There's a civil war.
Friends have become enemies, and vice versa.
There's lots of turmoil, many opportunities, and much to do.
We can't remain outside of it.
There are big ideals at stake.
Lots of money can be made.
Done!
- It's fixed.
- And this?
The plane's got too many parts! That piece is useless. Leave it there.
I'll let headquarters know you're here.
A ship or something might come by.
If you get back, drop in on me in
Palermo. Bring the woman, the wives... whatever, anybody!
Three years! Hard to believe!
Three years!
Come on! Take me along!
Why can't you?
- Hey, just a minute.
- Take me home!
- Take me home!
- Take it easy! Calm down.
I am calm.
I want to go home.
You could at least have taken the letters!
It's over.
Soon they'll come for us... and take us home.
And we won't see each other again.
I don't know how many men
I've been with.
I don't remember any of their faces.
When you leave, I won't remember... you, either.
Yes...
Me, you'll remember.
Let's do it?
Why?
- A nice game, right?
- Yes, nice.
- Look who's spoiling everything.
- Mind your own business!
You're just lucky, Pope!
The dice are round, but still...
I knew it! I'll never get used to it.
It's like drinking sand.
Let it settle on the bottom.
Learn to wait.
Smell the aroma, and wait.
That's the enjoyment.
What are you saying? Coffee is coffee!
You order it, drink it and leave. Shit!
Wait! Everybody waits!
What's there to wait for?
- I'll check it.
- What happened?
- Hi. What happened?
- Farina shot at me.
- What?
- It was my turn.
He's inside with her. He wouldn't let me in. I knocked and knocked... and started knocking down the door.
He shot at me from the window.
- Is he crazy?
- It seems impossible. What's going on?
- Antonio?
- Go away, all of you! You understand?
Leave us alone.
- He's gone nuts!
- What'll we do? What'll we do?
- Go get Raffaele.
- Me?
- Should I go?
- Why me?
- I could go.
- Should he go? Go on!
Does it hurt? It must hurt a little.
See? It hurts. Go on!
Go, Garibaldi! That guy shoots!
- Nino?
- One step closer and I shoot!
Oh, he talks big!
Fuck off, Nino!
- He's real crazy.
- An idiot! Real scary.
- It's true.
- Let's see it. Does it hurt?
It's not serious.
- Just a scratch.
- What the hell got into him?
He's inside with Vassilissa and won't let anyone in.
- Why?
- He won't respect the scheduled turns.
Talk to him.
Nino! Raffaele's here to see you.
Antonio, what are you doing?
Nobody' to touch Vassilissa!
That goes for you too, Lieutenant.
O. K., Antonio, but that's her line of work.
I mean, she's taken certain psychophysical needs to heart... she's proposing a solution...
- I mean, she's a prostitute.
- Not after today! I love her.
- What?
- I love her, Lieutenant. I love her.
He loves her.
Vassilissa?
Do you love him, too?
Yes.
Boys, that changes everything.
How can we go against feelings?
- We can't?
- What do you say?
We can't.
Because of his feelings,
I've got shot in the arm.
Oh, come on, it's not serious.
I have to go back...
The color is drying up.
Best wishes and lots of male children... my color's drying.
Get that disinfected.
One guy's color dries, another guy's wound dries. Let's go.
Sorry.
Now Vassilissa and Antonio are man and wife.
Drink to your marriage.
And then you, Antonio, will break the glass... to make sure nothing will interfere with your happiness.
Italians are like Turks, huh?
One race, one stomach!
Lieutenant.
Where's Noventa?
I don't know.
Know what this reminds me of?
When the vacation was over.
That's when we went back to school.
Vacation was over and we headed home.
This atmosphere here reminds me of that moment.
I wonder if it's right.
The world changes, and we're here.
Right or not, that' how it is.
It's destiny.
Destiny!
Destiny... can be manipulated...
You can try to have things go as you'd like.
One can change destiny.
It's not easy. Sometimes one has to obey destiny.
Did you see that star?
Did you make a wish?
It's not easy.
Know what I'd like?
A nice ship to take me away.
Not that it's bad here. But...
I'm beginning to feel... a need for a person. Someone... to be in love with.
Sergeant, I...
I could be that person.
I'm in love with you.
I don't know how the hell it happened.
They're British!
- Can we be sure they're friends now?
- Things change.
Italians.
- What did he say? I didn't hear it.
- "Italians".
What the fuck do they want?
Dimitri.
Dimitri! They are taliani, are taliani.
Who are those guys?
They used to live here.
They're coming home.
Not allowed... not allowed to take animal on the boat.
He and I, we're together.
And we're going home together.
To Italy.
If he can't go, I won't go either.
I'll stay. I won't move.
Try to move me!
See? A little reasoning...
Come, Garibaldi.
How much stuff are you taking?
Sergeant...
-What is it?
What is it?!
We'll never see each other again?
-Not again!
We will have a long voyage!
Where's Farina?
I can't fucking find him.
- I'll look for him.
- How much stuff are you taking?
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Tell me where! They'll leave him here!
- I don't know!
- What's up?
- "What's up?"?
What's up?
What do you want?
What do you mean, "What's up?"?
Come out and let's go!
I won't come. This is my house.
I'm married... I'm staying here.
Those guys won't wait.
They're British. Your marriage isn't valid in Italy. Move it! Let's go!
It's valid for me. Very valid.
Bring her too. Let's go!
They won't wait!
Where to? Where?
I have no home, no job. I'm alone.
Why should I leave? No!
Everything's changing. Italy needs rebuilding from the ground up.
There's much confusion.
It's a great opportunity.
We'll build a great nation,
I promise you. It's also our duty.
What duty? Even you agreed.
Remember?
They forgot about us.
I want to forget them.
Rebuild Italy, change the world!
I don't believe in it. I can't.
I'm staying here.
In an olive barrel on a deserted island?
Is that your ambition?
I feel alive, here, for the first time. You understand?
Vassilissa wants to start a restaurant. She needs me.
Don't be upset, Sergeant.
We're friends, aren't we?
Attendant Farina, this is desertion, you know that.
- I love you.
- Me too.
I can't believe in it.
An olive?
- I'm not hungry.
- Take one.
I said I'm not hungry.
Farina disappeared completely.
Disappeared. I looked everywhere.
- He must have fled to the mountains!
- Probably.
Maybe he's right.
Raffaele, we're going to build a great nation.
You'll see. He'll come back to live there, too. You'll see.
Give me an olive.
Italians, Greeks, my race, my face one face... one race...
Where did you end up?
RESTAURANT VASSILISSA
Lieutenant!
Antonio, I'm so very sorry.
I wasn't sure about the address.
Thank you.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
- You've lived here all along?
- Yes...
Did you see the restaurant?
I have a surprise for you!
Look who landed here!
Who is he?
Lo Russo!
Fuck! Lieutenant!
What the fuck are you doing here?
Life wasn't so good in Italy.
They didn't let us change anything.
So...
So I told them...
"You won..."
"but don't consider me your accomplice."
That's what I told them.
And so I came here.
And you? What are you doing now?
I'll give you a hand...

Not the front way.
They were private parties.
We came in the back.
We look really good tonight.
I'm sure we're going to get in.
Get back.
Let's get a cab.

When we get out, don't stop where the crowd is.

What?
Just until we get inside.
I don't get it.
We're all together.

Only him.
We're together. Come on, van.
This is important.

You can go in, but they'll have to wait.
Hey, nice coat.
Don't worry, Jimmy. We don't care.

Van just wanted to put me in my place.

No, but it was overdue.
You know, none of us really wanted to go anyway.
Yeah, we're exhausted.
No, I really wanted to go.
There's Jimmy Steinway.
I can't believe it...

It's not what you think.

It's always been there, I guess.
I've only begun to acknowledge it now.
You really think you're gay?
Taxi.
I was just starting law school
When the first up-Tempo
Philadelphia international hits broke:
Some people don't consider that disco...
Because it's good...
But I remember feeling absolutely electrified.
You feel electrified often.
No, but this was different.
I loved the idea that there'd be
All these great places for people to go dancing,
After the terrible social wasteland
Of our college years. Uhff.
You've been to a lot of discos?
No. In fact, practically none.
For me, law school wasn't easy,
And I haven't had much of a social life
Since coming to the city, either.
But I still consider myself a loyal adherent
To the disco movement.
It's a "movement"?
Sort of.
What I found terribly encouraging
Was the idea that when the time in life came
To have a social life,
There'd be all these great places
For people to go to,
Because, as you'll remember,
For many years, there were none.
Yeah.
What I didn't realize... is that it gets so impossible to get into.
Let's call it a night.
No, wait. I have an idea.
Jimmy.
Here take this. Jimmy!
Take this. Jimmy!
Oh, hi.
Hi.
You're des's friend.
Yeah, hi.
Where are Marshall and Steve?
They've gone back to the hotel.
Jim, come on.
I can't believe it.
Jim, let's go.
They wanted me to apologize for them.
They were really bushed.
What a disaster.
No.

It's not obviously connected, but...
I think that's what made me a little more tolerant
Of the guys at Hampshire.
What do you mean?
You were a bit critical.
The guys there preferred women more..."laid-Back."
I'm laid-Back.
For whatever reason,
You didn't have much of a social life there.
I had a social life...
Just not one of those terrible pretend-Marriages.
The Hampshire guys were jerks,
Hippy-Dippy suburbanites with all this hair...
And extremely dim intellectual interests.
I'm sorry, I don't consider the guy who did
The Spiderman comics a serious writer.
Alice, one thing I've noticed
Is that people hate being criticized.
Everyone hates that.
It's one of the great truths of human nature.
I think it's why my parents got divorced.
I'm sorry... It's just that you're so terrific...
It makes me sick to think that you might get in
That terrible situation again,
Where everyone hated you...
Hated me?
You're wonderful.
Maybe, in physical terms,
I'm a little cuter than you,
But you should be much more popular than I am... it would be such a shame
If what happened in college repeated itself.
Why would it repeat itself?
You're right.
I just think it's so important
To be in control of your own destiny...
Not to fall into that fifties cliche
Of waiting by the phone for guys to call:
The right ones never do.
Those who do,
You have to make the most ridiculous excuses to:
The nice ones get hurt feelings and hate you;
The jerks inevitably corner you
Into going out anyway.
Late at night you find yourself
With some awful guy with disgusting breath,
Thrusting his belly up against you,
Trying to stick his slobbering tongue
In your mouth. Ugh, yecch.
Thank god this is a whole new era in music
And social models!
We're in complete control.

I'm sure it's Jimmy.
I think it's much better to wait
Until things happen naturally.
Forcing things never works.
That's not true.
Forcing things usually works beautifully.
You know, even if he's in advertising,
Someone will want him.
I just think it's so important
That we be in control of our own destinies.
It doesn't matter.
Marshall's a really good guy.
He doesn't really care about this kind of stuff.
I can't believe it.
Uh, excuse me... has anyone ever told you you look just like
Kate Preston's brother rod?
Who?
Rod Preston. Do you know him?
Uh, no.
Have you ever noticed that people who look just alike

Hey, Jimmy, we're going to dance... Come on.
I'm too depressed to dance.
Go ahead.
What's wrong?
Absolute disaster.
What?
I had to get some clients into the club,
So I gave the boss my coat to wear...
"Here, wear this."
It's really stupid.
I can't believe what an idiot I am.
Why? Your coat's nice.
Well, that's just it: It is nice.
But this guy's...
Marshall's...
Clothes are hideous.
It's famous.
But to give him my coat to put over them...
It's so stupid.
It's just really stupid.
It's not stupid.

It was unbelievably, incredibly dumb.
He's a really nice guy, and I insulted him.

She's irritating?
I thought she seemed nice.
You know her?
Well, she's been here 2 times before.
How is she irritating?
I can't believe it.
You're really gonna throw me out?
Yeah.
Thanks, des! You've really been a good friend to me!

Who's she?
They call her "tiger lady."
It's actually a cheetah pattern she's wearing.
At some point, she wore a tiger pattern.
It's always something very slinky and sexy.
You consider her sexy?
Ah, yeah.
The banquette.
Where's Jimmy?
I don't know. He went to get drinks.
What would you like?
Uh, vodka-Tonic.
Me, too.
I'll go with you.
Ever since I was 6 years old or so,
I sensed I was somehow... different.
Then, every time you made love to me...
You must have wanted to vomit.
No. No, no.
Oh, you're beautiful!
You don't have to be some sweaty, horny,
Hetero he-Ape to admire and... And appreciate... female beauty... only very, very recently
Did the final realization come.
Exactly when did the final realization come?
2 days ago.
I get up late and usually turn on the TV,
Sort of as a reflex.
Wednesday afternoon,
There was a rerun of wild kingdom,
Mutual of Omaha's nature program with marlin Perkins
And that... attractive, younger guy.
It triggered something.
Suddenly everything fell into place.
I'm gay... and always have been.
You only found out you were gay
On Wednesday?
Only then definitively.
Wednesday was... gay day for me.
Finished eavesdropping?
I wasn't eavesdropping.
Come on. Anything interesting?
Shh. God!
Listen, it's much better you're with Tom than Jimmy.
You two really look great together.
You think so?
It's too bad we weren't closer friends in college.
I think I could really have helped you there.
For most guys,
Sexual repressiveness is a turn-Off.
You're saying this for my benefit?
You're a good conversationalist but... there's something of the kindergarten teacher
About you.
It's really nice, but... the guys you like also tend to be on the ethereal side.
It can get pretty far away
From any kind of physicality.
This is gonna sound dumb, but it really works.
Whenever you can,
Throw the word "sexy" into your conversation.
It's kind of a signal.
Like, um...
"there's something really sexy about strobe lights."
Or, uh...
"this fabric is so sexy."
Yeah, it is.
♪♪ That you and I could make it on through ♪♪
♪♪ ♪♪ But somethin' went wrong
Josh?
Uh, hi.
What are you doing here?
In New York or in the club?
In the city.
I'm an a.D.A. In Morgenthau's office.
An assistant district attorney for manhattan.
They call us "a.D.A.'S."
You're a prosecutor?
God, how did you get that?
It's not such a big deal...
I'm perfectly competent to do the job, des.
Great. Good.
I wasn't implying anything.
I was just surprised to see you here.
Going to Harvard must have been great.
Well... the people at Hampshire were nice,
And pretty smart, in a nontraditional way,
But I was out of place there.
I'm sorry, I don't consider the guy
Who did the Spiderman comics a serious writer.
Yeah, I thought it was the green hornet
People took more seriously.
Um, excuse me, are you Alice?
Jimmy Steinway gave me this vodka-Tonic to give you,
But I'm afraid I sampled it.
I'll get you another.
Jimmy's gone?
You're "hap"?
Yeah, he wanted me to tell you he's sorry,
But he was ejected from the club.
He was ejected?
Apparently he snuck one of his clients
In the back of the club.
That's odd he knew
I drank vodka-Tonics.
I never told him.
It's uncanny.
You mean, it's a complete cliche?
"All women recent college graduates drink vodka-Tonics,"
Or something like that?
Well, maybe.
So Jimmy think's I'm a total cliche
I ordered a vodka-Tonic, too... So what?
You're plenty original
Without having to order some weirdo drink.
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.
Can I get you another?
Thanks. Actually, if you don't mind,
I think I'd prefer... uh, uh, a whiskey sour.
Ok.

I do. This is a great place.
It's what I always dreamed of... cocktails, dancing, conversation...
Exchange of ideas and points of view... everyone's here...
Everyone you know
And everyone you don't know.
You should be proud, des.
This is quite an accomplishment.
Yeah. I am.
Who's the girl you were dancing with?
Oh, Alice Kinnon.
Oh.
Thanks a lot for getting me in.
Great.
I'm a little worried about that guy.
I think he might be having
A manic episode of some kind.
Now, des, don't get started on that.

Yeah.

We were all at Harvard together.
How did you get involved with environmental causes?
I think that's great.
You're interested in the environment?
Very much so.
Actually, there's one theory
That the environmental movement of our day
Was sparked by the re-Release of bambi
In the late 1950s.
For many members of the baby boom generation,
It was traumatic... the hunters killing bambi's mother.
Yeah, it was terrible.
For 6-Year-Olds, it's devastating.
To this day, no one wants to identify
With those hunters.
I think you're right.
You're living in some women's residence,
Aren't you?
Yeah. It's terrible.
No guests.
Huh.
Wow.
It's really nice.
Thanks.
Would you like anything to drink?
What?
Um... could I have... a pernod?
Sure.
This is supposed to be good
For cigarette mouth.
Do you smoke?
When I drink or go out at night,
I usually smoke.
I live dangerously.
On the edge.
I'm no kindergarten teacher.
What's this?
Um, I collect original edition
Scrooge Mcduck comics.
It sounds a little odd.
Not at all.
This is original artwork by Carl barks,
Who created the uncle scrooge comics.
He's considered a bit of a genius.
There's something really sexy about scrooge Mcduck.

"the author's brother is,

"Very kind decline."
Anything interesting?
Not really.
What time did you get back?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I didn't check.
Well, was it light or dark?
Why do you care what time I got in?
Sorry. No reason.
We've got to get an apartment of our own.
Do you know how long it takes
To become an editor?
You mean associate editor.
Yeah. Associate editor.
What's the minimum amount of time
To become an associate editor?
How many years?
That's hard to say.
Approximately.
Maybe 4 years.
But more than years,
Before you can become an associate editor,
You have to have a best seller.
How can you be sure you'll get a best seller?
You cannot.
But what if you don't find one?
You have to.
Show them the outline.
You might want to see this.
It's the Scott Meredith best seller outline.
"Create sympathetic characters,
"With whom readers identify.
Give them problems, make these problems big."
Could I photocopy this?
Yes, but I need it back.
I'd like a copy, too.
That stuff is such crap.
This does describe a lot of best sellers.
That's true.
It's completely formulaic.
Of course it's formulaic. It's a formula.
That's why I prefer nonfiction.
It's good you want to be an editor so much.
In this era of television,
You are devoted to the printed word.
Actually, ultimately,
I'd like to work in television.
But right now, what I need's a raise.
Alice and I have been looking at apartments,
But we can't afford one on what we get as assistants.
That's so comical.
What?
That giris like you really worry about paying rent.
Aren't your fathers heavily subsidizing
Your living expenses with big allowances?
They're not big at all.
In a few years, you'll marry
Some incredibly rich corporate lawyers.
It's not as if you really worry about paying the rent
Like the rest of us.
Oh, you worry about paying the rent?
Yeah.
Then you're way ahead of us
'Cause we don't even have an apartment.
What if, in a few years,
We don't marry some corporate lawyer?
What if we marry some meatball like you?
But not you personally,
But someone with similarly low socioeconomic prospects?
Can you believe that?
They really think that way.
Disco sucks.
What a dope.
Would you ever go out
With anyone who worked in the company?
Fortunately,
There's absolutely no temptation.
Charlotte, telephone.
It's a man.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
We were thinking of having some people for dinner
Saturday night.
Wanted to know if you could come.
About 7:30.
Ok. Where?
Actually, I'll have to call you back with that.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Ok.
Bye.
That was Jimmy Steinway.
He's coming for dinner Saturday night.
You called him?
I thought you said you could never be interested
In anyone who worked in advertising.
No one could say something like that seriously.
It was obviously a joke.
Anyway, it's not like it's a date or anything.
He's invited as part of a group.
It's really important
There be more group social life,
Not just all this ferocious pairing off.
You like Tom.
Invite him.
We don't even have an apartment.
How can we have a dinner party?
Well, it's another incentive to get one.
Does the Lexington avenue express stop at 86th street?
I think so.
We'd better hurry.
Do you really think we know each other well enough
To room together?
Well, maybe that's good.
It's not just that we don't know each other well.
I'm not even sure we really like each other.
That's ok.
You know, Alice,
I'm not so much of a bitch as I might seem.
You'll find holly's a little sensitive
About her intelligence.
She's dumb?
Harvard guys, even the ones that
Seem reasonably cool on the outside,
Are all essentially wimps and bookworms
On the inside.
They love being seen out with this lovely girl,
But after a date or two,
Rather than risk rejection,
They pretend to drop her,
Going around complaining about how dull she was.
Is she dull?
A little, but that's not the point.
Once you start worrying about something like that,
You're lost.
Holly was devastated.
She stopped dating entirely,
And weekends either went home
Or just hung around the library at pine manor.
What do you think you're doing?
Shove off, Mack!
Deviant!
Creep! Off!
So I wouldn't develop any illusions
About Harvard guys.
They can be amazing creeps, too.
Ah, there you are.
Hi.
Our friend still isn't here.
Sorry. I forgot which way the numbers went
On the east side.
It's what's called a railroad apartment.
It's long and rather narrow like a railroad car.
Each room opens directly onto the other.
It's very nice.
The closets are here.
This is the other bedroom.
The bathroom is back here at this end.
And the kitchen.
So to get to the bathroom from the living room,
You have to clomp through both bedrooms?
Well, there are 2 outside doors,
So in theory,
You can use the exterior hall
To go between the kitchen and the living room.
Huh.
Even with 2 roommates, the layout is a bit awkward.
You can't afford something bigger?
We all work in book publishing.
Couldn't your parents help?
They already are.
So what do you think?
I think it's really nice.
Isn't the layout a bit awkward?
Well, I think we should take it.
Here you go.
It's good to see bourgeois giris
Building up a sweat.
Why is that good to see?
You live around here?
There was a guild meeting at asphalt green.
A guild meeting?
The newspaper guild is organizing clerical
And editorial staff for book publishing.
I'm supposed to organize our department.
Oh, my god. We're all gonna lose our jobs.
You should support this.
You were just complaining how lousy the pay is.
Are you rooming with them?
That's gonna be really tough.
Aren't we behind schedule?
Nope. This recipe's extremely fast.
Hello.
Uh, it's Dan.
Dan?
Hi. Come up.
Dan from your department.
I invited him.
Departmental Dan?
You know... he went to Harvard.
So?
Yeah, I've got to meet some clients at 10:00
And get them into the club.
Tom isn't coming?
If he does, he'll be very late.
Isn't this what they call a railroad apartment?
Uh-Huh.
People always say how terrible they are,
But it seems pretty nice.
Well, the layout's not so good.
It's amazing the little things in life
One doesn't appreciate until they're missing,
Such as hallways.
These apartments were actually planned
In the last century as tenement housing
For working class families.
Now all the yuppie roommate combos
Are crowding them out.
Well... that's just tough.
Fight!
Rumble!
Actually, I was thinking I'd go home.
What?
You should come.
I don't know.
I'm not really a disco type.
Well, who is?
I probably wouldn't get in anyway.
Of course you'll get in. Holly's gorgeous.

Have fun, jack, harry.
Thanks a lot, des. I really appreciate it.
Fine, cool.
I'm starting to realize how important eye contact is.
I can't talk to people in this thing.
They get nervous. They don't know who I am.
Well, that's the point.
You think tonight would be a good time
To talk to van?
Try to patch things up, get a reprieve of some sort?
Uh, no.
My job's sort of on the line, des.
And not all clients will be such good sports
As harry and jack.
If it's a question of groveling,
I can do that.
Just point me in the right direction.

Sure. What?

Yeah. Manny hanny used to be a client.
Manufacturers hanover.
I know what manny hanny is.
Note... no lock.
10 is the cover charge.
God. Paying a cover charge to get into a club?
How humiliating.
That's your reaction?
Look at this.
Kind of worrisome, don't you think?
Yeah.
To me, shipping cash to Switzerland
In canvas bags
Doesn't sound honest.
To me, it suggests possible illegality.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Well, I'm not going into that room anymore.
Uh, gimlet, please?
Domestic beer or bud?
Um... whiskey sour?
Excuse me.
You're Alice Kinnon, aren't you?
Yeah.
We met at that party in sag harbor,
Labor day weekend.
You were just coming in as I was leaving,
And you asked me where the kitchen was.
Do you remember?
I do remember getting to the kitchen.
Uh, excuse us.
We're here sort of as a group.
If you don't mind?
Excuse me.
Why did you say that?
I didn't like the look of him at all.
Didn't you notice how he was eyeballing you?
Creepy.
Frankly, I thought he might've been the guy
That bothered me on the subway.
I'm sorry if I overreacted.
Poor guy.
It's no big deal.
That kind of thing happens all the time.
Anyway, you've got Tom.

Do you remember the conversation we had
Labor day weekend?
Had a huge impact on me.
Really?
Jennifer and I had been talking all year
About either acknowledging
The permanence of our relationship and marrying
Or finally just breaking up.
I had no idea you were even dating anyone.
I thought you knew.
No. We've been together since college.
But the weekend after labor day,
We had this long talk.
Jennifer proposed a trial separation,
Which normally I'd have considered ridiculous,
But I couldn't help thinking of you
And went along.
Out of some sort of
Residual loyalty to Jennifer,
I didn't call you immediately
And instead started coming to the club.
I'm not a very good dancer, but...
No, you are.
I was also curious if the sexual revolution
Went as far as everyone said it had.
But emotionally, I couldn't handle it.
I got so depressed, and... when I saw you that night,
You were... a vision,
Not just of loveliness, but of... virtue... and sanity.
What?
I shouldn't talk about it.
I'll just end up sounding like an idiot.
No, what?
You're very sexy
And good-Looking and modern and hot.
But what I was craving
Was a sort of sentient individual
Who wouldn't abandon her intelligence
To hop into bed with every guy she meets
In a nightclub.
Why... why is it that when people have
Sex-With-Strangers on their mind,
Their I.Q. Just drops, like, 40 points?
All that affected
Sexy seductress slinking around?
And uncle scrooge is sexy?
I mean, my god, is there no limit?
No. That was to...
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I'm so sick of all the lies and nonsense!
Alice?
Alice, what's wrong?
What happened?
Mcgrath! Where is he?
I'd say it's definitely not a good idea
To approach van tonight.
There he is.
Mcgrath!
Drew Mcgrath.
You're out of here right now.
What?
Bernie. Bernie!
Where is he? Here he is.
Bernie, this guy's through.
What's going on?
We had a public safety situation in the front.
This jerk comes out, trying to make it worse.
Is this true?
Public safety situation?
Give me a break.
It was a joke. I'm sorry.
We had a public safety situation.
The cops came. It was no joke.
I tease him a tiny bit.
No teasing, des.
No teasing?
Either he goes or I do.
Come on, van. Des, grow up.
Cut it out.
Ok. Sorry.
It's the ad guy.
So, it's the dancing ad man.
You're finished.
Ok, I work in advertising.
Is that a crime?
What's happening in this country?
There they are! Get 'em!
Get the tin man. Get him.
Get this jerk out of the club.
You're fired, des. You're out of here.
You can't fire me, van.
Only Bernie can fire me.
Ok.
You're fired.
And take this yuppie scum with you.
Good riddance!
Yuppie scum?
In college, before dropping out,
I took a course in the propaganda uses of language.
One objective is to deny other people's humanity
Or even right to exist.
In the men's lounge,
Someone scrawled "kill yuppie scum."
Do yuppies even exist?
No one says, "I am a yuppie."
It's always the other guy who's a yuppie.
I think for a group to exist,
Somebody has to admit to be part of it.
Of course yuppies exist.
Most people would say you two are prime specimens.
We're not yuppies!
You think we're yuppies?
You're seriously saying you're not yuppies?
No.
Yuppie stands for "young upwardly mobile professional."
Nightclub flunky is not a professional category.
Contrary to popular belief,
Junior-Level ad jobs don't pay well at all.
I wish we were yuppies:
Young, upwardly mobile, professional.
Those are good things, not bad things.
Where we going?
Rex's. Oh, no.
What's wrong with rex's?
Well, you can't dance there,
And it's full of boring preppies.
Oh, and we're so interesting.
You can dance at rex's.
Yeah, but why rex's?
Why not some other place?
Well, for one thing,
Everyone at the club knows that I go there,
So when they come looking for me,
I wanna be there.
Why would they come looking for you?
What happened tonight was a mistake,
Which even now Bernie's probably very much regretting.
He's a smart guy.
Not without good qualities... even if very few.
I wouldn't be very surprised if he's already called rex's
To retract my dismissal.
How can you be so sure of that?
Well, I'm not sure of it.

Hey. Hey, rex.
Welcome to rex's.
Alice, you look like you've seen
The dark side of the moon.
What did Tom say?
No. I feel much better.
I love your idea of social life as a group,
Without all this ferocious pairing off.
I couldn't have stood being alone tonight.
I thought Bernie was smarter than that.
What a blunder.
When they do call, we'll get you immediately.
Thanks, rex.
Rex is such a great guy.
Yeah. Charlotte says she can tell if a guy's gay or not
Just by looking in his eyes.
How?
Maybe it's related to how they look at you.
It's hard to define,
But I think women can tell.
I can't.
Are Jimmy or I gay?
Come on, don't.
Jimmy?
No.
Well, not your eyes,
But you do have a gay mouth.
A gay mouth?
I have a gay mouth?
What does that mean?
Just what I said.
It's true, des. Your mouth does look gay.
God! How moronic can you get?
What nonsense!
Don't think I don't know your whole act.
Excuse me?
Pretending to be gay
To get sympathy from women
While cruelly dumping them,
And to seem cooler than you actually are.
I despise your whole pathetic act.
You're not fit to lick the boots
Of my real gay friends.
Well, I don't want to lick the boots
Of your real gay friends.
You know, I could be gay.
I see through you completely.
Oh, you see through me completely.
Yeah, I do.
That's the dark side of feminism.
What?
You have a kind of free pass to make any kind of wounding
Or derogatory comment you want.
I am hardly a militant feminist.
No, you're not.
A militant feminist would be a lot fairer.
It's women like you whose attitudes to men
Are so dehumanizing.
Like what?
That men are swine,
Obsessed with large breasts
And the sex act,
Devoid of any idealistic or romantic sensibility
When in fact,
We have that idealistic sensibility
In spades.
For instance, you have no idea
What men really think about women's breasts.
What do men think about women's breasts?
Well, it's not something you just blurt out.
It's far more complicated and nuanced than that.
Ok, I'll tell you a story.
When I was in college,
There was a girl I had a crush on
Who always had older boyfriends,
Invariably some senior.
Finally, they all graduated,
And one night we went back to her room alone.
Suddenly, her shirt was off,
And I was confronted with these breasts,
Which turned out to be completely surprising
And frankly, disconcerting.
They were rather large and not ugly
Or especially strange-Shaped,
But in all the time that
I had thought about her,
These breasts had never figured.
She took off her shirt so quickly,
There was no time for adjustment,
And I said something arrogant about it,
As if her abrupt unveiling of her largish breasts
Was somehow going to slay my swinish male self,
As if I hadn't already been slayed
On a much higher level.
Her name was Alice, too.
Oh, come on, des.
You know that's not true.
What do you mean, it isn't true?
Her name wasn't Alice.
Well, I'm not gonna use her real name.

Had a trial separation,

What you might not know
Is that about a week ago,
They started seeing each other on the sly,
Cheating on their trial separation.
How do you know that?
Working at the club,
You find out all kinds of things.
You know, this is the way people used to dance in bars
In the old days.
Do people ever really dance in bars?
I thought that was a myth.
People my older brother's age, uh, they did.
Your brother must be a lot older.
Before disco,
This country was a dancing wasteland.
You know the woodstock generation of the 1960s
That were so full of themselves
And conceited?
None of those people could dance.

I think she noticed
That, for a moment, I flinched.
She dropped me like a rock.
I was crushed.
I couldn't take it, so I dropped out
And got in the night club business early,
Thanks to which
I probably owe my success today.
Let's share a cab.
We're thinking of going.
You're all going?
Yeah.
Have they called yet from the club?
I don't think they will call.
Bernie will probably send some emissary.
That's more his style.
What should we do with the oz costumes,
Just, uh, bring 'em by the club tomorrow?
Actually, those costumes are mine.
Just get 'em back to me when you can.
I thought we were here as a group.
You talked about the tremendous importance
Of group social life.
Well, it's really late.
Yeah, Alice, it's getting really late.
We'd better get going.
Hey, thanks again, des.
Ciao.
Bye.
Bye.
All week charlotte's been talking about
The tremendous importance of group social life,
Opposing all this ferocious pairing off.
Well, group social life has its place,
But at a certain point,
Other biological factors come into play.
Our bodies weren't really designed
For group social life.
A certain amount of pairing off
Was always part of the original plan.
God, I can't believe you'd say that.
What?
What did I say?
What you mean to say is that they've all gone back
To screw their brains out?!
No, I didn't say that!
I said they were going to pair off.
Well, wait, don't go!
I didn't mean to say anything
Anyone could be offended by.
Oh, thank god. He's here.
Des, Bernie regrets what happened.
It was a mistake, and he wants you back.
I'm sorry. I know why you're so upset.
I mean,
I know what really happened with Tom.
What?!
That he thought
You were really slutty or something.
That's so stupid!
You can't worry about what misinterpreters think!
That's so unfair!
Come back to my place. We should talk.
Nothing will happen!
I just need somebody to talk to.
Maybe you do, too.

Alice, what would your dream book to publish be
If you could publish any book?
Anything that might become a bestseller.
Aside from that. Your dream book.
I'd say... a collection of new J.D. Salinger stories,
But more in the direction of the laughing man

I'm sure it was Jimmy.
It's very quiet.
Get out! Get out!
That was pretty bad.
God!
What's the matter now?
What?
All the noise...
Clomping around, banging pans.
Sorry. I didn't realize it.
You obviously intended it.
What do you mean?
That's very aggressive.
You don't clomp around, banging pans
For no reason.
Like what reason?
You know perfectly well.
Because I only bang pans?
Well, frankly, that's not what I heard.
Ok. Anything I did that was wrong,
I apologize for.
But anything I did that was not wrong,
I don't apologize for.

Come here, Rufus. Let's see. Let's see.
Aww. Aw, poor Rufus...

I've decided to go ahead
With the Tibet book proposal.
What?
The memoir by the Dalai lama's older brother?
Oh.
I'd like to bring it up
At Wednesday's editorial meeting.
You really liked that?
Other people liked it, too?
Yeah.
Ok. I'll take another look.
You know, it's considered a little self-Indulgent
To read too much of a manuscript
If it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
Have you known holly long?
Just since we found the apartment. Why?
She's very, uh... quiet, isn't she?
Well, I would say, not more than normal.
Your standard of normal could be different from other people's.
How do you mean?
I don't understand that.
I guess what
I'm asking is...
You do like holly, don't you?
Yeah, of course.
But... she is intelligent, isn't she?
Well, sometimes I question
Her dating choices.
God, you're tough.
I'm not tough in the least.
No. You're really tough.

Congratulations, Alice.
Yeah, your first book. Great.
It could be a bestseller.
Charlotte. Oh, charlotte.
That was so moving,
What you said about our obligation to writers.
Thanks.
And how often we fall short of that.
Well, let's face it,
Most authors are still conceited dopes.
Oh, you... You can't say that.
You're an editor.
You don't have to deal with them on a daily basis.
When you're an assistant,
It's harder to dodge their calls.
Good going, Alice.
I'm really glad we got this book.
I understand that you know some people at the club.
Do you think that maybe, um,
Sometime you could, uh, get us in there some night?
Yeah. Certainly. We'll arrange that.
Very good. Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Dan.
Sure.
Do you have any idea why Jimmy's
Suddenly so interested in your social life?
No. He's interested in my social life?
Haven't you noticed?
He's always wondering
Why you don't go out or go to the club.
He is?
You know, Alice,
You've been hanging around the apartment a lot.
You've kind of set up office there.
None of the rest of us has any privacy.
The railroad apartment wasn't my idea.
Yeah, that's true, but it's just odd
That you're so much friendlier to Jimmy
Now he's with me.
I just think the situation's kind of awkward.

It's that important to you
To stay in advertising?
Ok. Better see him while he's still on his upswing.
Hey, des.
Hi.
God, what happened to you?
Jesus. Josh, you're a mess.
I'm a mess.
I got to talk to you.
You sure you don't want to clean up a little?
It's kind of serious.
I'll look for Alice and charlotte,
See if they've come in.
That's Audrey Rouget,
The youngest person ever to be made an editor
In the history of farrar, Straus.
How do you know her?
She interviewed me.
How did it go?
Have you ever been in an interview
And gotten the impression they see through you completely?
I didn't get an offer.
You don't want to clean up a little?
No.
You know, you look really bad.
I know. That's actually good in my work.
It puts people at ease, looking like this.
They feel, frankly, superior to me
And say things they ordinarily wouldn't.
It's very disarming.
Phew! What happened?!
I was having drinks
With some friends in the village,
And there was this terrible guy
Really bothering this girl,
So I decided to intervene,
But it turns out they were married.
What's this now? You're not here
On official business, are you?
Knowing that we went to college together,
They asked me to talk to you.
Who is "they"?
I can't tell you.
I couldn't believe you'd be involved
In the kinds of things
That have been going on here
And told them so.

Any more races to turtles? Not on your life.
I liked that tortoise.
So do I, but if you were a betting person,
Would you say, "that tortoise won against the hare.
In future races I'm backing him"?
No. That race was almost certainly a fluke,
And, afterwards, the tortoise is still a tortoise,
And the hare, a hare.

Do you have strep throat or some flu
You're taking antibiotics for?
Oh, my god! You have the clap, don't you?
You're on antibiotics,

Alice.
I am so, so sorry.
I should never have said that.
I have some sort of sick compulsion
To say everything that occurs to me.
I just want to let you know,
As soon as I can find a new rooming situation,
I'm moving out. I can't take it anymore.
It's not possible.
You're not serious.
Just let me know when you're ready to go.
Ok.
Please, Alice.
Rooming with you and holly
Has been the most important thing
To happen to me in my life.
You're the first woman friends I've ever had.
The anger you're feeling now
Is actually more justified than you know.
When we were at Hampshire,
I really hated you.
You seemed so moralistic and judgmental.
I had no idea, then, how you really were.
When guys wanted to ask you out,
I'd talk them out of it.
Oh, my god. I can't believe how evil I was.
But I've completely changed.
If you will give me another chance,
I'll be the best friend you've ever had.
If the apartment situation weren't so impossible,
I'd move out now.
I can understand how you'd feel that way.
You're right to.
But things aren't always as they seem.
Bad and inexcusable as what I said back there
Might have been, I think you'll find
It'll actually improve your reputation
With these guys enormously.
You'll be more popular than ever. Watch.
Vd's not all bad.
You'll find there are actually
Positive aspects to it.
What?
Well, you know that "please inform
All previous partners" thing?
It's actually a terrific way
To get back in touch
With guys you might have liked
But have lost contact with.
Just in my own experience,
It's twice led to renewed relationships
With guys that lasted quite a while
And were really... sweet.
I'm not talking about herpes infections,
Which are far more serious
And apparently incurable,
Just standard vd and other conditions
Easily treatable with antibiotics.
God, are you following me or something?
You said you weren't taking anything.
Well, I'm not. It was a gift.
I never buy the stuff,
And anyway, it hardly affects me.
Oh, no.
Actually, what I'm high about
Is the situation with Alice.
This makes her seem much more accessible.
She's not operating on a plane
So far removed from the rest of us.
There's hope for me.
What did josh want to talk to you about?
Is everything ok?
Uh, no... not exactly.
I'm sorry to bug you about this,
But I'd be really grateful
If we could talk with van soon.
The way it's going, if I can't get people in here,
I'm going to lose my job.
Des! You lied to me!
I thought you were a wonderful man,
But it was all lies!
No!
You said you loved me!
And then you said you were gay,
But you're not!
Everyone knew but me!
You completely humiliated me!
I could be gay.
You're saying again you're gay?

Alice, congratulations on the TV sale.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
How's holly?
Fine.
Is she, um, going out with anyone?
Yeah, this really nice guy who went to Denver university
And works in real estate.
He found her this incredibly cheap apartment.
She no longer lives with you guys?
You hold what happened against me.
Not that you broke up,
Just that you go out with people
Based primarily on looks.
Holly's also very nice.
A lot of people are nice.
You only asked out the fabulously good-Looking one.
You hold that against me.
Well, pretty shallow.
You know, Alice, except for politics,
We've got a lot in common.
We're both pretty serious
And, I think, respect each other's
Bases for judgment.
Occasionally,
I get reactionary thoughts, too.
I'm not reactionary.
Well, aesthetically.
Oh, well, aesthetically.
You mean you think I gave it to you?
How can you be sure?
I'm sure.
Well, you were a lot more active than I was.
You were obviously very experienced.
No.
Oh, come on.
How did you know all that?
Well, I read a lot.
You must've been with some guys.
You weren't a virgin.
I didn't consider myself a virgin,
But... what?
I don't know.
Technically... what?
If I'm making love,
The man... spurts... outside the woman,
Does that count as sexual intercourse?
"Spurts"?
If it squirts outside, without getting in,
Does that count as losing your virginity?
No part of the man got in at any time?
I don't think so.
I think part has to get in... to be considered sexual intercourse.
So then I was a virgin.
Oh... I can't believe that.
The first time you make love, I...
I give you both "g" and an "h" infection.
"H"?
Your move.
I'm beginning to think that maybe
That old system of people getting married
Based on mutual respect and shared aspirations,
And then slowly, over time,
Earning each other's love and admiration,
Worked the best.
Well, we'll never know.
Almost ready.
God, waiting around all night
For the unemployed guy to get around to shaving.
You're so busy you can't shower until midnight?
Excuse me. Unemployed is not who I am.
I'm a fully-Employed person
Who just happens not to have a job right now,
Largely because of some structural problems
In the advertising industry.
I'm sorry. That was really inconsiderate.
Please forgive me.

Of course, if you talk enthusiastically
About your work in advertising,
You sound like a total cretin.
No. Your enthusiasm
Is actually enormously appealing.
In fact, I used to not think so well
Of people in advertising,
But it's one of the great things
About getting out of college and into the real worid,
How experience changes and improves your views.
During college, I remember seeing couples
With crying babies and thinking "how horrible."
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time
With my niece and nephew.
Saturday, I took my niece, who's 7,
To see the Disney movie,
Lady and the tramp. She loved it,
Was so cute.
I'm beginning to fall in love
With the whole idea of having kids.
I hate that movie.
What?
It's so... tacky,
Not to mention depressing.
This sweet movie about cute cartoon dogs,
You found depressing?
There is something depressing about it.
And it's not really about dogs.
Except for some superficial bow-Wow stuff at the start,
The dogs all represent human types,
Which is where it gets into real trouble.
Lady, the ostensible protagonist,
Is a fluffy blonde cocker spaniel
With absolutely nothing on her brain.
She's great-Looking, but... Let's be honest...
Incredibly insipid.
Tramp, the love interest,
Is a smarmy braggart of the most obnoxious kind:
An oily jailbird out for a piece of tail
Or whatever he can get.
Come on.
No. He's a self-Confessed chicken thief
And all-Around sleazeball.
What's the function of a film of this kind?
Essentially, it's a primer on love and marriage
Directed at very young people,
Imprinting on their little psyches the idea
That smooth-Talking delinquents
Recently escaped from the local pound
Are a good match for nice giris from sheltered homes.
When in 10 years, the icky human version
Of tramp shows up around the house,
Their hormones will be racing,
And no one'll understand why. Films like this
Program women to adore jerks.
God, you're nuts.
The only sympathetic character,
The little scotty who's so loyal and concerned about lady,
Is mocked as old-Fashioned and irrelevant
And shunted off to the side.
Isn't the whole point that tramp changes?
Ok, maybe in the past he stole chickens,
Ran around without a license,
And wasn't always sincere
With members of the opposite sex.
But through his love for lady
And the beneficent influences
Of fatherhood and matrimony, he changes... and becomes a valued member of that,
You know, rather idyllic household.
I don't think people really change that way.
We can change our context, but we can't change ourselves.
What does that mean?
Well, you've changed.
Come on, des.
That's a little different.
I agree with josh.
The scotty is the only admirable character.
It would have been a much better movie
If lady'd ended up with him.
I'm really surprised.
I think tramp really changed.
Maybe he wanted to change, or tried to change,
But there's not a lot of integrity there.
First, he'd be hanging around the house,
Drinking and watching ball games
And maybe knocking lady around a bit,
But pretty soon he'll be back
Down at the town dump chasing tail.
Oh, give me a break.
Are you taking your medication,
'Cause what you're saying is
Completely nuts! God, des... no! I think people should know
That our friend here has a certain condition.
How can Morgenthau shut up! Employ you?
He knows about mass. Mental health
And the loony tunes junior year?
Of course he knows about it.

Yeah. There's a sales conference at the Americana.
I'm actually with the international side now,

But, in human terms, uh, pretty cold.
How 'bout you?
I was at Mccallum, but just got sacked.
Have you found anything else?
No.
Any leads?
No.
You know, there're a lot of agencies in Spain
Looking for people with experience from here.
There's one in Madrid
Some Burnett people have affiliated with.
I could give 'em a call.
That sounds great.
Michael.
Good times.
I don't identify with tramp at all.
I was just sticking up for him
Because no one else was.
I actually identify
With the loyal scotty dog, too.

But, otherwise, I do it myself.

I briefly had that.
In any case, I doubt I'll be working there much longer.

How's it changed?
I can't say.
You can't say.
Maybe des is more involved than I thought.
Or more involved with someone you know.
That's a conflict, josh.
I still can't believe Alice is really serious about des.
Why not?
She seems smarter than that.
That doesn't matter. There's something
Deeply ingrained in human biology.

"Has some disgruntled employee,

"Is there some sort of spy here?

And it might not look so good.
Cut out the drugs, des.
What?
Don't make such a spectacle of yourself as a drug user.
Don't receive them, don't consume them,
And don't pass them on to others.
What are you talking about?
You could be charged with dealing.
Dealing? Those were gifts!
Well... who's accusing me of this?
This is you, isn't it, josh?
That's a conflict. We both like the same girl.
So, you really want to go to a beef house?
A beetha.
A beefha.
A beefha.
They go topless at a beefha.
I hear san Sebastian's pretty good.
Oh, look, there's blood.
Ciao.
Ciao. Good night.
Look out.
Oh, god!
Oh, my god!
I didn't know anything about it.
The agency just funneled
Clients they wanted to get into the club through me.
Usually, before I got into the car,
I hadn't even met them.
I just assumed they were clients from out of town.
That the I.R.S. Was our largest client
Didn't occur to me then.
I swear I didn't know anything about it, des,
At first.
You scumbag.
Josh promised me you'd be protected.
Oh, great. What's a little shocking
Is that they'd do something so obvious and clumsy
And move so fast,
No matter how richly I may feel you deserved it.
These were just some creeps
Mad van'd turned them away before.
Van's operating under tremendous pressure.
I'm starting to feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.
Oh, great. That's priceless.
You and van, oh, I love that.
Oh!
Want a snort?
Guess not.
I have a very bad feeling about the club, des.
It's like a meteorite is headed straight for it.
It's gonna destroy everything.
The greatest club the worid has ever seen
Is going to be smashed to smithereens.
Yeah, well, I don't think it'll be a meteorite.
Bye.
Alice and I are having breakfast together.
It's a date. You can't come.
Sorry.
Try to get some sleep.
That's what guys do who want to date you?
They say they have a book idea?
Maybe.
Did he say what the book was?
He said he had some crazy ideas
For a book on the criminal justice system.
Of course. That makes sense.
Crazy ideas are the kind that josh would have.
Be careful of that guy.
I was there when he flipped out.
Really scary.
He got up on a table at a cafeteria off Harvard square
And started weirdly singing this hymn.
Apparently, religious mania is highly typical
Of manic depression entering its manic phase.
Josh is not just your garden-Variety loon.
He is a serious nutcase.
What gets me is that this serious nutcase
Now presumes to judge others.
You really think the neurological effects of coffee
Is similar to that of cocaine?
That's what I read somewhere.
In addition to amazing stories,
There are a lot
Of entertaining prosecutors' anecdotes.
And then there's the whole culture
Of the downtown legal district.
It could be good.
Like everything, it all depends on execution.
This is sort of related.
It's an article I wrote for Harper's
During law school.
Did you really just want to have lunch
To discuss a book proposal?
Um... no.
How serious are you and des?
Is it absolutely, completely,
Irrevocably serious?
Did he tell you the story about
How he was traumatized by a Radcliffe girl
Taking off her shirt,
Suddenly revealing her largish breasts,
Which he never thought about before?
He tells that story all the time
To get sympathy and to justify himself,
As if he were the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity.
That wasn't true?
No, it was true. He was the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity,
But so was everyone else.
Not everyone then went on a rampage
Exploiting the opposite sex.
He thinks his problem is just that he falls in love a lot.
Well, a lot of people fall in love a lot.
I'm really surprised you'd be taken in by him.
You should notice I didn't answer your original question.
My original question,
Whether you were absolutely committed to des,
You didn't answer?
What does "loon" mean?
Des calls me that.
I sort of like it.
It's, uh, short for "lunatic"
And also the lake bird with the eerie call.
It's the other terms des uses for me...
"Nutcase,"
"freakazoid," etcetera...
I kind of mind.
A lot of people like to say
They won't take "no" for an answer.
I just wanted you to know
I'm not one of them.
I can be easily discouraged.
I will take "no" for an answer.
Ok.
No.
You don't mean that.
No.
I'm sorry.
She's not in right now.
Ok. I'll have her call you back. Thank you.
Alice, sorry.
What?
You better see bob.
Bob wants to see you right away.
It's something bad?
The author of your
Tibet book doesn't exist.
He's a fraud.
Carol thinks it could be worse
Than the Clifford Irving case.
Carol thinks it's as bad as the Clifford Irving case.
Turns out the author isn't the Dalai lama's brother,
But a Los Ángeles writer named John Disimio.
It's a shame. This is a really good book.
Dan thinks it's one of the best things
Ever written on Tibetan Buddhism.
What a mess.
I'm sorry I haven't been more of a help.
I've been a little preoccupied myself.
I'm late for my period.
How late?
A day.
A day late, and you're worried?
I'm sure I'm pregnant.
But isn't that what you wanted?
What do you mean?
Well, I thought you said
You wanted to have
Jimmy Steinway's babies.
Yeah, but not this way.
I'm not an addict.
I'm a habitual user.
I'm sick of you and that nut case
Going around judging everybody.
"Oh, he's an addict."
"Oh, he's basically honorable
Except for his treatment of women."
I am not a womanizer.
In fact, I hate womanizers.
In any case, Alice completely changed all that.
Isn't that a little morbid?
Morbid?
Why take on all that baggage?
Isn't he a bit of a sicko?
From the start, you know he's defective.
Usually you don't find that out
Until much later.
And what if you have kids?
It can be hereditary.
One thing about Jimmy:
I know he'll make a good father.
There's always some problem, some baggage.
Oh, my god, you're serious.
Well, not necessarily.
Coming.
Tonight I'm gonna tell Jimmy.
Wish me luck.
You know, I think my father could have
Been an undiagnosed manic-Depressive.
Hi. Uh, do you know josh is downstairs waiting?
Yeah. Thanks.
Bye.
Bye. Bye.
Alice is so great.
I've gotta be a better friend to her.
Yeah.
Before leaving the D.A.'S office,
I'd like at least once the chance to use
The expression, "book this clown!"
Heh. I thought only police said that.
No, I think an a.D.A. Could,
In certain circumstances,
Perhaps not very typical.
Are you aware
All your clothes are slightly big?
I'm still waiting for my growing spurt.
Both my father and brother are over 6'3".
You can still grow in your twenties.
There are cases on record.
Tall people tend to have great personalities,
This kind, compassionate comprehension
Of the rest of the worid.
My father and brother are both that way.
What's wrong?
Just remembering something.
What?
It's kind of maudlin.
It was here
My depression first descended.
Oh.
"To the valiant seamen
"Who perished in the Maine
By fate unwarned, in death unafraid."
Isn't this the strangest,
Most forlorn monument?
Yeah, it's very sad.
What happened with your depression?
Nothing at first.
I just went back to
Cambridge very depressed.
Then there was the incident at the hayes-Bickford,
After which I was taken to mass. Mental for observation.
While there, I cut my hand trying to open a stuck window,
And they put me on a suicide watch,
Though I don't think I was ever really suicidal,
At least no more than a lot of people that age.
But you're ok now?
Uh... yeah.
Actually, a lot of people spend considerable sums of money
To get the high I get absolutely naturally.
Now, with lithium,
Which is, in fact, a naturally occurring salt,
I can stay on a perfectly even keel,
Perhaps too even.
Did they prescribe lithium right away?
Lithium wasn't so standard then.
There was a lot of muddling through various therapies.
Because my right hand was bandaged,
I used my left to write friends cards,
Which was a mistake.
My handwriting looked weird and really scared people.
I... I don't think
I was ever that... that badly off, but others might disagree.
Do you know the words
To the hymn dear lord and father of mankind?
While I was in the hospital, it became a sort of mantra.
♪♪ Dear lord and father of mankind ♪♪
♪♪ Forgive our foolish ways ♪♪
♪♪ Reclothe us in our rightful mind ♪♪
♪♪ In purer lives, thy service find ♪♪
♪ ♪♪ In deeper reverence, praise ♪

What's wrong?
You think I'm a wacko?
What's wrong?
Uh, I don't know.
Charlotte's in terrible pain.
It's her back.
No, nothing happened.
We were just talking.
About what?
Charlotte said she had something important
She wanted to talk to me about,
But before we got to that, her period started.
Afterwards, I mentioned that it might be a good time
To start thinking about
Whether we were really right for one another
Or we should start thinking about,
You know, breaking up.
Josh hasn't called since that night.
Of course he hasn't.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on. You told me.
He sang a hymn or something.
You were totally weirded out.
I can't believe how intolerant you are.
Some of those old hymns are beautiful.
I've sung them on the street myself.
I didn't realize it was so controversial.

There are a couple of alternatives
That aren't that that-Bad.
First, some guy who's already been around a lot
And almost certainly has it anyway,
So it'd be no problem
And, in fact, would give you something in common.
The other would be some guy
So idealistic and in love with you
That he'd want to commit himself to you
Prior to that step because his dream would be
To be with you forever, always, exclusively anyway.
I think skip's a bit that way.
What?
I need to see des. It's urgent.
He's busy.
He'll wanna know this.
Des!
Des!
Des, open up!
I didn't let him in, des.
He got by me.
Jesus Christ. Are you out of you mind?
It's about to start.
Get rid of all your "gifts"
And anything else you might have.
Oh.
Step aside. Coming through.
Names.
Take this guy at the door.
We're on the list.
Jesus Christ, you're not gonna use that against me
With Alice, are you?
Francesca was just feeling terribly needy tonight.
It has nothing to do with how I feel about Alice.
You're not gonna take unfair advantage of that.
Ok.
All right, let's go!
I'm a cop.
This way, gentlemen.
All right, let's go!
Downstairs first. Harry, jack.
We're gonna come in here. This way.
You can't touch those.
Those are my personal papers.
Yeah. Well, they're part of the premises now,
And as such, the warrant applies. Sam.
Book this clown.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing here in the dark?
I was just resting.
Have you seen josh at all?
Yeah.
Is he ok?
Sure.
Why wouldn't he be ok?
I don't know.
He hasn't called in a while.
Josh is a bit thin-Skinned.
He's the kind of guy who will take no for an answer.
Sag harbor.
Did you know I was sort of infatuated with you then?
I assumed you preferred Tom.
Also, you seemed a little... irritating.
How was I irritating?
Well... you weren't.
There's no chance of you
Getting infatuated with me again, is there?
Just had to confirm that.
Let me keep your passport for you.
No.
Come on, help me out.
Should people just be allowed
To steal from each other and the government,
And out of selfishness or indifference
Or a kind of fashionable cynicism,
The rest of us do nothing?
I thought better of you than that.
You did?
Well, wrong again.
Listen, you've got all their books and all their documents.
Why do you need me who knew practically nothing?
This is the only body I've got.
Good-Bye, josh.
Kennedy airport.
Are you a bit of a cad,
Leaving town with your girlfriend in the hospital?
It might look that way.
But it isn't?
I've been through this before.
After graduation,
Laurie and I were gonna break up,
But the same day,
She came down with terrible back spasms.
I hung around the hospital all summer,
And I almost bankrupted her parents.
And as soon as I left town, she recovered.
By going away and putting an ocean between us...
I.E., making a definitive break...
Charlotte's likely to recover much faster.
What makes you think putting an ocean between you
Necessarily means a definitive break?
That's a depressing thought.
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf in Spain.
I'm gonna turn over several new leaves.
You know that Shakespearean admonition,
"To thine own self be true"?
It's premised on the idea
That "thine own self" is something pretty good,
Being true to which is commendable,
But what if "thine own self" is not so good?
What if it's pretty bad?
Wouldn't it be better in that case
Not to be true to thine own self?
See? That's my situation.
The one I like is, "et tu, brute."
There are different ways of being loyal.
Some may seem on the surface disloyal,
But they're not.
There's a higher loyalty.
The way I see it,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar.
By stabbing him in the back,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar?
You know, I probably should have stayed and testified.
Josh is right.
Bernie is a bad guy, probably worse than they know.
That's what van thinks.
Van's cooperating.
Staying and cooperating would have been the right thing to do,
But instead I'm running like a rat
Because to thine own self be true.
They say I can probably go home tomorrow.
Great.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Do you think Jimmy's going away could have
Had anything to do with him, you know... having some sort
Of bizarre, pathetic crush on you?
I don't know.
Well, did he ever say anything?
Yes.
What?
Well, he...
"Why don't you love me
Instead of jerks like des and josh?"
That kind of thing?
I knew it.
You bitch!
I knew it was something like that.
I don't think I want to room with you anymore.
Being around you hasn't been good for me or my back.
I'd like you to move out.
I don't know how I'll afford it,
But my sanity and my integrity
Are more important to me than money.
I have to start looking out for myself now.
Have you heard the news?
No, what?
They're selling the company.
What?
We're merging with Simon & Schuster.
There'll be the usual consolidation
And economies of scale.
A lot of us are gonna lose our jobs.
God, that's sad.
I love the company.
They've been so great to us there.
Well, I don't know.
We were exploited,
But they were nice about it.
Maybe it'd be good if they got rid
Of some of the deadwood in that company,
Particularly if it meant paying the rest of us
Decently enough to live in this city
With at least a modicum of privacy.
Why don't we do something?
Like what?
Well, at this time of day,
Employed people often have lunch.
I can't. I've gotta go uptown.
Why?
Alice and I are having lunch.
You're having lunch with Alice?
Great. Let's all go.
It's, uh, at Lutece.
You're on unemployment
And taking Alice to Lutece?
Um, doesn't irrational expenditures
Signal the start of a manic phase?
If it were my invitation, you'd be right,
But it's not.
Alice is taking you to Lutece?
Why'd she take you?
Celebrating her promotion.
When Alice wants to celebrate something,
She calls you?
Alice made editor?
Associate editor.
Well, what happened with her book?
I thought it was some kind of fiasco.
What Alice did, rather cleverly,
Was shift the category
From nonfiction to self-Actualization.
The book jackets hadn't been printed yet.
Reincarnation, life after death...
Mumbo jumbo of all kinds
Has been highly commercial
Throughout the history of book publishing.
The first printed book was the bible.
Actually, I'm not upset I was laid off.
This'll motivate me to get a better job in television,
Which is where my interests truly lie.
I've watched television all my life.
If you're really
Interested in television,
You should come over and watch
Wild kingdom sometime.
Sure.
Are you taking the "e" train?
Yeah.
$2. Thanks.
Hey, van!
What happened?
Ah, the new owners couldn't make it work.
Finally had to hire people to stand outside,
Pretend that they couldn't get in.
Anyway, disco's over. It's dead.
What do you mean?
Well, people just aren't going out like they used to.
They're tired.
Some are sick or strung out.
It's not just the prosecutions
And all the owners that Bernie squealed on.
Could part of it be related to the herpes epidemic?
Maybe. I've got a friend
At Casablanca records and tapes,
And she says that, like, 2 months ago,
The bottom dropped out of all disco record sales.
Suddenly, it's... dead, over.
God, that's sad.
We're getting older.
We've lived through a period that's ended.
It's like dying a little bit.
Disco will never be over.
It will always live in our minds and hearts.
Something like this, that was this big
And this important and this great,
Will never die.
Oh, for a few years, maybe many years,
It'll be considered pass? And ridiculous.
It will be misrepresented
And caricatured and sneered at,
Or worse, completely ignored.
People will laugh about John Travolta,
Olivia newton-John, white polyester suits
And platform shoes and going like this.
Though we had nothing to do with those things
And still loved disco.
Those who didn't understand will never understand.
Disco was much more and much better than all that.
Disco was too great
And too much fun to be gone forever.
It's got to come back someday.
I just hope it will be in our own lifetimes.
Sorry. I've got a job interview this afternoon,
And I was trying to get revved up,
But most of what I said, I, uh, believe.
I was pretty furious when you had
My passport lifted, confiscated,
At the airport, but you were right.
I'm glad I stayed.
At least you saved me
From being stuck in some foreign city
With the likes of Jimmy Steinway.
But there's one thing I don't get.
You did a good job with the prosecution,
Getting Bernie to squeal that way.
Why'd they lay you off?
There was a conflict involving
Giving preferential treatment to a friend
Which they felt I handled badly.
Oh.
Well, congratulate Alice for us.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't envy her, though, stuck in book publishing.
Oof. Yeah.
I've gotta get to unemployment and sign up.
I'm going to Florida this afternoon.
So long.
Bye. Bye.
One of the things that makes me happy in life
Is knowing that I don't envy anyone.
I don't want to be anybody else
Or do anything but what I'm doing,
Which, right now, is nothing,
But I have good projects for the future.
Can I speak honestly?
Yeah.
You and I are similar.
We both got big personalities.
That's good. The worid, frankly, needs more big personalities.
But perhaps ours burn too brightly,
Are too big for people with normal,
Healthy-Size personalities like Alice
Or abnormal, healthy-Sized personalities like josh
Or itsy-Bitsy, teeny-Weeny,
Polka-Dot-Bikini-Size personalities
Like Jimmy Steinway.
That's why I'm confident
I'll ultimately be successful in television.
Absolutely. See, one of the problems
Of finding the right person and settling down
Is it takes all the fun and interest
Out of going to nightclubs.
I mean, if you're already living with somebody,
Why bother going out?
Getting seriously involved with someone
Really just means ruining your nightlife.
What I mean to say is,
Jimmy, Alice, Josh... so what?
That's what I say.
I think I agree with you.

What's this war in the heart of nature?
Why does nature vie with itself?
The land contend with the sea?
Is there an avenging power in nature?
Not one power, but two?
I remember my mother when she was dying.
She looked all shrunk up and gray.
I asked her if she was afraid.
She just shook her head.
I was afraid to touch the death
I seen in her.
I couldn't find nothing beautiful or uplifting... about her going back to God.
I heard people talk about immortality.
But I ain't seen it.
I wondered how it'd be when I died.
What it'd be like to know that this breath now... was the last one you was ever gonna draw.
I just hope I can meet it the same way she did... with the same calm.
'Cause that's where it's hidden... the immortality I hadn't seen.
Kids around here never fight.
Sometimes.
Sometimes when you see them playing.
They always fight.
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.
- Why?
- 'Cause you look...
You look as an army.
- I look army.
- Yes.
Well, that don't matter.
It doesn't matter.
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.
Okay.
There you go.
Go, go, go, go. Go.
Go, go, go. Go!
Witt, patrol boat.
She's American.
What's it doing out here all alone?
You haven't changed at all, have you, Witt?
You haven't learned a thing.
All a man has to do is leave it to you, you put your head in the noose for him.
How many times you been AWOL?
You been in the army, what, six years now?
Ain't it about time you smartened up and stopped being such a punk recruit?
I mean, if you're ever gonna.
We can't all be smart.
No, we can't. That's a shame.
Look at you.
Truth is, you can't take straight duty in my company.
You'll never be a real soldier.
Not in God's world.
This is C Company, of which I'm first sergeant.
I run this outfit.
Now, Captain Staros, he's the C.O., but I'm the guy that runs it.
Nobody's gonna foul that up.
You're just another mouth for me to feed.
Normally you'd be court-martialed.
But I worked a deal for ya.
You oughta consider yourself lucky.
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.
You'll be a stretcher bearer.
You'll be taking care of the wounded.
I can take anything you dish out.
I'm twice the man you are.
In this world... a man himself... is nothin'.
And there ain't no world but this one.
You're wrong there, Top.
I seen another world.
Sometimes I think it was just my imagination.
Well... then you've seen things I never will.
We're living in a world that's blowing itself to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.
In a situation like that, all a man can do is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.
Look out for himself.
I might be the best friend you ever had.
You don't even know it.
He hates you worse than poison.
I never felt he hated me.
'Cause I don't hate him.
I love Charlie Company.
They're my people.
They call it "The Rock."
Now, nobody wants this island.
The Japs just put an airfield there.
All the fighting's confined to this area.
As you can see, this is their road to Australia... and this is their way of controlling the sea lanes to America.
Now, if we're gonna stop the Japs' advance... into the South Pacific, we've got to do it right there.
The marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.
Worked my ass off.
Brown-nosed the generals.
Degraded myself... for them, for my family... my home.
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.
Most men your age would have retired by now.
It's okay.
We need general officers with maturity and character like you.
We've got good sergeants.
We've got good lieutenant colonels.
But once a man gets those eagles...
He can't wait to get that star.
Can he? He becomes a politician, right?
Goes along to get along.
So goddamn hard to stay upright.
- You said it there, sir.
- With the admiral watching, which he will be.
There's always someone watching you.
Like a hawk.
Always someone ready to jump in if you're not.
Do you have a son, Colonel?
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Good.
'Cause we don't want our sons or our grandsons... fighting this war
30 years from now, do we?
- No, sir. We sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.
You... You dig them out of the hills and protect that airfield.
Yes, sir.
Do you wonder why... why did they...
Why did the Japs put an airfield there, of all places?
I guess we don't know the bigger picture though, do we?
If there is such a thing.
What do you think?
- Well, sir, I never asked myself that question.
- Mmm.
You're a humble man.
Nobody wants that island, but you.
How much do you want it?
As much as I have to, sir.
All they sacrificed for me... poured out like water on the ground.
All I might have given for love's sake.
Too late.
Dyin'... slow as a tree.
You feel it?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Take topside to the signal bridge.
The closer you are to Caesar, the greater the fear.
I just can't help how damn scared I am, Sarge, all right?
I just can't help how damn scared I am, Sarge, all right?
I can't help it. I got...
You know, my stepdaddy took a block and beat me when I was real little.
And I... I was scared.
And I used to run. I used to hide.
Hell, I slept in a chicken coop a whole lot of nights.
And...
I never thought it'd get no worse than that.
But I'm living by the... by the minute over here.
I'm counting the seconds.
- Yeah.
- And we're gonna be landing...
We're gonna be landing soon.
There's gonna be air raids.
We're probably gonna die before we get off the beach.
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.
- What's your name, kid?
- I want to own an automobile when I get out.
- What's your name?
- Edward... Edward B. Train.
Train.
The only things that are permanent is... is dying and the Lord.
That's it.
That's all you got to worry about.
This war ain't...
This war ain't gonna be the end of me.
- And it ain't gonna be the end of you neither.
- Think we'll catch an air raid?
How in the hell should I know?
All's I know is them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the last time they made this run.
On the other hand, time before last, they nearly got blew up.
- What do you want me to tell you?
- You're a big help, Tills.
Nothing. Tell me nothing.
Tell you something.
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a couple of fuckin' ducks in these here boats.
- That's what.
- I already know that.
Well, brood on it, Tills.
Brood on it.
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- Ain't interested.
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested even if it wasn't.
Well, I'm on my way to get me that pistol.
- Yeah? Well, have fun.
- Yeah, have fun.
You'll wish you had one once we get ashore... and run into some of them samurai sabers.
Open this door!
Open this goddamn door!
Open the door!
I learned to deal these cards before...
All right. Here I am sleeping.
Yeah.
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?
- All right, jacks high, jack bet.
- Robert's got two jacks.
I never bargained for nothing like this when I signed up for this man's army... back in the Bronx before the war.
How was I supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin' war?
Answer me that.
All I know is old Charlie Company's always gettin' screwed. Always.
And I can tell you whose fault it is too.
It's that captain of ours.
First he gets us stuck off on this boat, clear away from our own outfit... where we don't know a fucking soul.
Then he gets us stuck way down...
Hello, Captain.
Read in your 201 file you were an officer before the war.
How'd you end up a private?
'Cause of my wife.
I was in the Corps of Engineers.
We'd never been separated before.
Not even for a night.
I...I took it for four months... and then I quit.
Just resigned.
Th-They... They sent me back to the States.
They told me I'd never get another commission.
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.
Sons of bitches.
No, I don't blame them.
Well, where is she now?
She's home.
Why should I be afraid to die?
I belong to you.
Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!
Move, move! Movin' out!
If I go first, I'll wait for you there... on the other side of the dark waters.
Put your helmet on.
Be with me now.
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
I like you, Captain.
And I just want you to know... well, we're in this thing together. All right?
You keep pressing inland till you reach the line.
- I'll catch up with you there.
- Yes, sir.
It's all yours, Captain. Gangway!
Gangway, there! Coming through!
Squad leaders! Both teams!
This way, son. This way.
Right here.
Stand by to go inside!
Our Father who art in heaven...
- And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
- Okay.
For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory.
Your outfit's lucky.
Transports must've been spotted.
You're getting out of here just ahead of time. You're lucky.
Ho! Ho! Ho! Take a breath, mister!
You gotta breathe!
- Are you Charlie Company?
- Yeah.
We went in about a mile, sir.
There ain't nothing there.
Some oil drums, a burned-out spot.
There'd be nothing there for at least...
- About a week.
- About a week, sir.
But we didn't spot any casualties.
Japs must have hauled ass.
Couple of mortars hit the beach, but most of the guys came in standing up.
Darnedest thing I ever did see, sir.
They got fish that live in trees.
Oh, if they didn't know this beach was deserted, what else don't they know?
Who are you who live in all these many forms?
Your death that captures all.
You too are the source of all that's gonna be born.
Your glory... mercy... peace... truth.
You give calm a spirit... understanding... courage.
The contented heart.
- Blankets.
- We need a medic now!
Maybe all men got one big soul... who everybody's a part of.
All faces of the same man.
One big self.
Everyone looking for salvation by himself... each like a coal... drawn from the fire.
We're going straight up that hill there.
We can't do that, Colonel.
Well, there's no way to outflank 'em.
Now, on the left there's a cliff that falls straight down into the river.
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.
What about water, sir?
Water's not getting up here.
My men are... passing out, sir.
Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitchin'.
We're all gonna attack abreast,
3rd platoon in reserve.
We've got to cross those three folds of ground. You see?
Once we get beyond that, we gotta attack that hill.
Colonel says there's no way to outflank it... so we gotta take it head-on by frontal assault.
- Whyte?
- Yeah?
- You see those grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.
When you get to the end of that field... you're to locate and eliminate all the hidden strong points on those ridges.
I'm sure the Japs got something there to protect the approaches.
Are you here?
Let me not betray you.
Let me not betray my men.
In you, I place my trust.
Eos Rotodoctolos...
Rosy-fingered dawn.
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?
Did you ever read Homer?
We read Homer at the Point.
In Greek.
What kind of artillery support do we have, sir? Over.
Two batteries of 105s.
- They won't make a dent in that position. Over.
- No, but it bucks the men up.
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.
Okay, you guys. This is it.
We're going down in groups of 10.
There's no point in going by in rushes.
We'll only make a better target stopped.
Run all the way.
We ain't got no choice.
We're picked, so we gotta go.
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale... you go organize them guys that's up there.
Movin' out in five minutes.
Let's go.
Sico, what's wrong with you?
I'm sick to my stomach.
Sico, you get up right now, or I'll kick you so hard in the stomach...
- you're gonna be sick.
- I can't, Sergeant. I would if I could.
I'm... I'm sick.
- I'm sick.
- You ain't sick. Get up!
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.
It's my stomach.
I'm in pain. I got cramps.
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.
- Come on. Get up.
- Leave him.
I need a volunteer to carry the B.A.R. Drop your gear, Sico.
I'm taking you to the medics.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Don't argue with me.
Good luck, Keck.
Plug that hole on your right.
Move!
- Maybe they pulled out.
- Mm-mmm.
Hit dirt! Hit dirt!
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.
Stretcher bearers!
Move it out! Move out!
Come on!
- Stretcher bearers, this way!
- Come on!
Go get that man!
We already got eight or nine down there.
We're not supposed to...
Don't argue with me!
I'm Captain Staros. Go get that man.
Jim, he's not the one we should be thinking about.
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?
Am I the captain or a goddamn private?
We got others that are hit bad, sir.
That was all I meant.
- I gave you an order, Private!
- Yes, sir!
Hello, First Sergeant.
Who we going after over here?
We think it's Jacques.
Jockey?
Well, shoot.
That's... That's... That's too bad.
Sir? Sir.
Sir, can I come back to the company after we get Jockey back to the battalion?
- Okay. But you gotta get permission.
- Sure.
- All right.
- And my rifle.
Get up, Nicky!
You're still alive!
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Magnificent, Staros! Magnificent!
The finest thing these old eyes have seen in a long time!
Beautifully conceived! Beautifully executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.
Young Whyte led beautifully.
- Yes, sir. Over.
- But sending in your second too was brilliant.
Just brilliant! They might well have carried the ridge with luck.
I don't think they were hurt too bad.
Blane led well too.
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?
Did they knock any out?
We oughta have those ridges cleaned out by noon! Over.
Hello? Hello?
Staros, are you there?
Here, sir. Over.
I said, how many emplacements did they locate?
Did they knock any out? Over.
Children.
I don't know, sir.
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?
How can you not know? Over!
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.
I'm right here behind the swell.
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.
I want you to get up there and see what the situation is.
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.
Now, goddamn it, the admiral got up at dawn for this!
Come to life down there, Staros! Out!
Move up!
Hey, Keck!
Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.
Blane's dead.
You're in charge.
We know you there, Yank.
Tojo eats shit!
No! Roosevelt eats shit!
I got him! I got him!
I killed a man.
Hey, Queen!
Queen, you there?
Worst thing you can do.
Worse than rape.
Queen! You see them Japs leaving that left ridge?
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- No, I ain't seen much of nothing.
Well, get your fuckin' head up and look around!
I'm serious!
I counted seven Japs leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!
I got me one of 'em!
- So?
- I think maybe they're pulling out!
Maybe somebody oughta go tell the captain!
Well, you wanna be the one to do it?
You just stay put!
I'm ordering you!
Stay down!
Stay low.
Go! Go! Go, go!
What do we do now?
We wait right here. Maybe they'll send us up some reinforcements.
To do what?
To capture some of these goddamn fucking positions around here! What do you think?
- You mean you really want to go on with this?
- I don't know.
No. No. Not no uphill charge, but... if they send us up some reinforcements, maybe we could... scout around and locate these machine guns.
Anyway, it's better than going back down through that.
- You wanna go back down?
- Something's coming. They're coming.
What are they doin'?
If they wanna throw us out of here... why... why didn't they come in force?
Maybe they was acting on their own.
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.
They're coming.
Keck!
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus!
I blew my butt off!
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!
Lay down!
- What a fucking recruit trick to pull!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
I grabbed it by the pin!
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.
Nobody's gonna have to write your old lady.
You're gonna make it.
- Don't you bullshit me!
- Stay down!
Hey, hey.
I got mud on my face.
Wipe it off.
Get it off. No!
I'll write her. I promise.
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.
Maybe it's for the best.
I'm all messed up down there.
I can't...
I can't fuck no more.
Wha...
Where am I?
Where am I?
You're gonna be all right.
Even if you die.
You didn't let your brother down.
Hey, if you hadn't thrown yourself against that embankment, we'd have all been killed.
I'm gettin' cold.
I'm cold.
I'm freezing.
You gonna write his wife?
Fuck, no.
I don't know his old lady.
That's the company commander's job.
That ain't mine. You out of your mind?
- I ain't... I ain't no good at writing no letters.
- You told him you would.
I'll say anything to 'em when they're like that.
- Somebody ought to do it.
- Well, then you write her. You write her.
What's wrong, Jim?
- Aaah!
- There's nothing anybody can do for him.
He'll be dead before they can ever get him back to a surgeon.
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Well, maybe it's worth a try.
At least I could get a syrette of morphine into him.
Would it keep him quiet?
Not for long.
But I could give him two.
And I could maybe leave him three or four for himself.
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?
That's what you are.
That's all there is for us.
That's us. That's us.
I lost all 12. I lost all 12.
All 12 of 'em.
It's insanity up there.
I told 'em what to do. I showed 'em where to go, and I gave 'em a push.
Come on! Somebody help!
I know you. I know you. I know you.
- Sergeant, it's insane.
- I don't know who's in charge.
- I don't know who's in charge! But don't let him go!
- All right.
- Don't let him go! I'm outta here. I'm outta here.
- Take him back.
- Let me hold your rifle.
- I'm outta of here. All right. Move, feet, move.
Move, move, move.
Move! Move! I'm moving.
I'm moving. I'm moving now.
Please, don't touch.
Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. Okay, I'm outta here.
Come on. My feet are all right.
All right.
Somebody help me! Help me!
How goes it, kid? You gotta be quiet!
I came to help you, Tella.
Okay, calm down.
Fuck you! I'm dying!
I'm dying, Sarge!
Okay. Well, goddamn it, do it with less noise!
- Are you gonna get me out of here?
- I'm gonna take you back.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Put me down! Put me down!
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
Please, leave me alone.
Give me more. Give me more.
Give me more.
Give me more. Give me more.
Give me more.
- Okay.
- Give me more.
- Give me more.
- Here, Tella.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
Bye, kid.
Bye, Sarge. Good-bye.
Well, f-fortunately, Jim, the fate of the company doesn't depend on one man.
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing through the glasses.
I want you to know I'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow.
I'm gonna recommend you for the Silver Star.
- That's the most courageous thing...
- Captain.
Captain, if you say one more word to thank me, I'm gonna knock you right in the teeth.
You mention me in your fuckin' orders, and I'll resign my rating so fast... and leave you here to run this busted-up outfit by yourself.
You understand?
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.
What the hell's the matter with you, Staros?
Those men should be reinforced immediately!
What the hell are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses!
They're just lying there behind that ledge!
They should be up and out, cleaning out those machine guns! Over.
I don't think you understand what's going on down here, sir.
We've had heavy casualties.
We had a man...
His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir.
It created quite an upset.
Fine, fine.
Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.
I have two squads to...
First platoon I can send up, sir. Over.
What the hell do you mean, two squads?
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say reinforcements, goddamn it, I mean it!
You commit everybody you have there and do it right now! Everybody!
Your first platoon too. I see 'em lying down there on their fat asses doing nothing.
You get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack!
And you move 'em by the flank to the ridge!
Then you get that second platoon... you move 'em over to the hill!
Have 'em press the center.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!
You attack them right now!
Jesus Christ, Staros! Do I have to give you a 10-cent lesson on infantry tactics... while your men are getting their asses shot off?
Colonel, I don't think that you fully understand what is going on down here.
My company alone cannot take that position, sir.
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much firepower.
Colonel, there's a... there's a bunker up there.
We can't see it, and it's - it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.
I formally request to be given permission for patrol reconnaissance around... to the right of Hill 210 through the jungle.
I believe the entire position, sir, can be outflanked with a maneuver there in force.
- No!
- It might save lives.
Goddamn it, I tell you no!
There will be no flanking move!
- Now listen to me, Staros.
- Damn!
You're not gonna take your men around into the jungle... to avoid a goddamn fight!
Now do you hear me, Staros?
I want you to attack.
I want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal.
Now attack, Staros!
That's a direct order!
Come on!
Sir, I must tell you that I refuse to obey your order.
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.
I again request permission for patrol reconnaissance around to the right in force.
The time, sir... is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.
I've got two witnesses here listening to what I've said.
I request that you do the same with witnesses there. Over.
Staros, don't you pull this guardhouse lawyer bullshit with me!
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer!
This is not a court of law!
This is a war! It's a goddamn battle!
Now, I want that frontal attack!
I repeat my order! Over!
Colonel, I refuse to take my men up there in a frontal attack.
It's suicide, sir.
I've lived with these men, sir... for two-and-a-half years, and I will not order them all to their deaths.
Over.
This is a very important decision you're making, Staros.
But if you feel that strongly, maybe you have a reason.
- So I'm coming down there.
- Take a look.
Now, I'm not rescinding my order to you, son.
But if I find there are extenuating circumstances when I get down there...
I'm gonna take that into account.
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there!
And if possible, you get those men on the ridge out and moving! Out.
One spot's as good as another, men.
There's no place to hide.
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Where's... Where's Fife?
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.
Hold my hand, Fife.
Hold my hand.
I got it.
Oh.
I'm dying, Fife.
Oh, Captain.
Shut up in a tomb.
Can't lift the lid.
Played a role I never conceived.
Get that blouse on, soldier!
It's not a goddamn bathing beach.
Yeah, right here.
Put it on right now.
What are you aiming at, son?
Let's go get those son of a bitches!
Move up!
What are you doing laying down there where you can't see a damn thing?
Observing, sir. Just sent 1st platoon forward to the ridge, sir.
- How many of 'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.
None? Not one?
That doesn't sound much like the situation you described to me over the sound power.
Well, it's not, sir. The situation's changed, sir, just in the last five minutes, sir.
Captain, you listen to me.
Now, we're going over there, and we're taking everybody with us.
Now, do you have any more formal complaints or demurrers?
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right, goddamn it!
We're gonna do things my way! My way!
You understand that, Captain?
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!
I think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced, sir.
Show me how to see things the way you do.
Show me how to see things the way you do.
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.
Bell, take six men... and go see what's up there.
And we'll cover you best we can from down here.
Okay. You guys... You guys stay here.
Okay?
I'm goin' up alone.
Come out.
Come out where I am.
There was a...
There's a bunker up there.
It's five guns. It's five guns.
That strongpoint up there... somewhere up there around those rocks... is the key to this ridge.
Bell here is quite right.
From their knob up there, those goddamn little brown brothers... can cover the whole of the ground in front of this position for a thousand yards.
They've left this ledge unguarded.
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.
That's a hell of a mistake.
We need to take advantage of it before they see their error.
All right. All right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted.
And we've had a hell of a time getting water up here.
For that I'm sorry.
I apologize to you all.
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.
So I'm asking for volunteers.
Go back up there and knock it out.
Sir?
I'll be glad to... to go back up and lead the way back for a party.
- All right, Bell.
- I'll go, Colonel, sir.
And you. All right.
I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
I'd like that very much, sir.
All right, John.
I was hoping you'd say that.
- Go ahead. You'll be in command.
- All right. I'll go, sir.
- All right, you.
- Sir.
You.
All right, men. That's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.
I don't know if you realize the importance of this operation, Staros.
Once our position is secured, we can move the bombers in.
That means air power for a thousand miles in every direction.
Guadalcanal may be the turning point in the war.
It'll cost lives, Staros.
- Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.
Now, I explained to you the importance of this objective.
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?
I can't say, sir.
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives of any of your men in this campaign?
How many?
One? Two?
Twenty?
Lives will be lost in your company, Captain.
And if you don't have the stomach for it, now is the time to let me know.
No, sir. You're right.
About everything you said.
Fine. Fine.
That's all, Captain.
One more thing, Staros.
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me that you think I'm right.
Ever.
We'll assume it.
Dismissed.
I feel sorry for you, kid.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.
This army's gonna kill you.
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do for anybody else.
Just running into a burning house where nobody can be saved.
What difference you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.
If you die, it's gonna be for nothin'.
There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be okay.
There's just this one.
Just this rock.
Go ahead. Come on.
Who's deciding who's gonna live?
Who's deciding who's gonna die?
This is futile!
Look at me.
I stand right up here and not one bullet!
Not one shot!
Why?
How come they all had to die?
I can stand right here. I can stand right up, and nothing happens to me!
We.
We together.
One being.
Flow together like water... till I can't tell you from me.
I drink you.
Now.
Now.
You're my light.
My guide.
John, we'll be right behind you.
If you can break through, we'll come pouring after.
We'll charge at your whistle signal.
All right, let's go, men.
Go get 'em.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Okay.
Stay down, below this ledge... and I'll call down the data from above.
Once the 81 s have plastered that rock as much as possible... we're gonna crawl along the big rock for cover... and then flank them to the right.
Okay?
Okay. Okay.
Azimuth 1-4-7-0... from Easy Roger Seven.
100 left. Add 200.
Uncle Baker One, fire mission.
Azimuth 1-4-7-0 from Easy Roger Seven.
Left 100. Add 200.
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.
Understand.
1-4-7-0 from Easy Roger Seven.
Left 25, drop 50.
Left 25, Uncle Baker One.
Left 25, drop 50.
Fire for effect. Over.
Roger, Uncle Baker One. 1-4-7...
Let's go!
Okay, we're gonna continue on up the hill to the right.
Nobody fire or throw their grenades till I give the signal.
Okay, let's do it.
Is he okay?
- Is he all right?
- What do you want to do now, sir?
- We can't take him with us.
- No, we can't leave him here!
Shut up. He's from your platoon.
You stay with him.
We can leave him and pick him up on the way back if he's still alive.
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!
We're pinned down!
Fall back!
Go!
Move back!
Look out!
Watch out!
Clear!
Clear!
Come on! Get down!
Come on. Get out of there.
Come on.
Want to kill soldiers?
You piece of shit?
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
You all right?
I shot a man.
Stinks around here.
All these dead people.
Put a cigarette up your nose.
Fire in the hole!
Look at 'em move!
Look at 'em move!
We got 'em on the run!
Way to go, John!
When they saw you make that attack and win, it was like you'd put their hearts right back in 'em.
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't do that, soldier!
Take good care of the others, men.
G-2 will want them.
There'll be somebody around before long.
I think we've wasted enough time here.
Let's go!
Sir, I've got a few recommendations for decorations I'd like to turn in to you.
Yes, yes, John. We're gonna get everything for all of 'em that we can, but later.
In the meantime, I want you to know that I'm personally recommending you for something, John.
- Perhaps the big one.
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel I deserve it.
Oh, yes, you do, John.
Yes, you do.
Getting it for you, now, that's gonna be the goddamn problem.
But, hell, it would just be a big thing for the battalion and the regiment too if you did get it.
Now, we better get moving out of here.
We need to extend our lines, hook up with the other companies and push on to the top.
Would you like to take command of Baker Company over on the left?
Of course.
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket or anything like that, but about the water...
- If we don't get some water to these...
- Don't worry about water.
John, I don't want anything to break up this attack of ours, now that we have the momentum.
We'll have some water in a couple of hours.
I've arranged for that.
Now, we just can't stop now, goddamn it, and wait for it.
No, sir.
That's right.
And if some of the men... pass out... why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.
All right.
They could...
You know they could die from it.
Well, they could die from enemy fire too!
They're all tough boys.
Come on, men, let's go!
You'll see plenty more of those where we're going!
Are we going up this hill or aren't we?
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese position can be broken right now.
All we have to do is keep going and we'll have this hill.
We'll have this hill by sundown.
You see the spirit in these men?
Do you see the new spirit?
Well, I want to take advantage of that before something happens to sap their strength.
To have this battalion relieved in... in a defeat... or even to have it reinforced from troops from the reserve regiment...
If we were to stall before reaching the top, well...
Jesus Christ, that's just a hell of a lot more than I could stand!
I've waited all my life for this.
I've worked, slaved, eaten, oh, untold buckets of shit to have this opportunity... and I don't intend to give it up now.
You don't know what it feels like to be passed over.
I mean, you're young.
You're just out of the academy.
You know, you... you've got your war.
Fifteen years, this... this is my first war!
John, someday you'll understand.
You're like a son to me, John.
You know what my son does?
He's a bait salesman.
You've done a hell of a job, John.
I'm gonna make sure that you get everything... everything that you deserve.
Thank you, sir.
God...
Goddamn it! I want three runners!
Get me three runners!
You go back to the rear as far as you have to go to find water... and get back here with it as fast as you can!
We attack in one hour!
We'll throw everything we got at 'em!
We're going all the way!
Nothing's stopping us!
It's high ground by nightfall!
You seen many dead people?
Plenty.
They're no different than dead dogs... once you get used to the idea.
They're meat, kid.
Are you righteous?
Kind?
Does your confidence lie in this?
Are you loved by all?
Know that I was too.
Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness?
Truth?
This way!
Get down!
Get on the fucking ground!
Get fucking down now!
Get down! Get down!
Get down! Stay there!
Get back!
Get on the fucking ground!
Now!
This great evil.
Where does it come from?
How did it steal into the world?
What seed, what root did it grow from?
Who's doing this?
Who's killing us... robbing us of life and light... mocking us with the sight of what we might have known?
Does our ruin benefit the earth?
Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine?
Is this darkness in you too?
Have you passed through this night?
I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver.
You're dying.
See them birds up there?
They're gonna eat you raw.
Where you're going, you're not coming back from.
What are you to me?
Nothin'.
Have a seat here.
Staros, I'm relieving you of your command.
Lieutenant Band will take over for you.
I already told him.
It's a hard thing to do.
Difficult decision to make.
I don't think you're tough enough.
You're too soft.
You're just too soft-hearted.
You're not tough-fibered enough.
Anyway, it's... it's my decision to make, and I've already made it.
I don't like to see my men get killed, sir.
Have you ever had anyone die in your arms, sir?
Have you?
I don't see any reason to make a scandal out of this.
I don't want it in the records of the battalion where I commanded... and there's no reason for you to have it on your records.
This has nothing to do with cowardice or inefficiency.
Look at this jungle.
Look at those vines, the way they twine around the trees, swallowing everything.
Nature's cruel, Staros.
I'm going to let you apply for reassignment... to the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Washington for reasons of ill health.
You're a lawyer.
You had malaria yet?
- No, I haven't.
- Doesn't matter.
I can fix that.
Anyway, you probably will have it.
I'm also recommending you for the Silver Star... and I'll recommend it in such a way it definitely won't be refused.
Might as well have the Purple Heart too.
Why?
Because of that scratch on your face... and because of those cuts on your hands.
Now, you listen to me, Staros.
I think it's best you go back right away with the next batch of wounded and prisoners.
It is no goddamn good for you to keep hanging around.
The quieter we keep this, the better it'll be for all.
This is from Colonel Tall.
"Our victory gives us the highest reasons for pride."
"It will prove a milestone in the battle for Guadalcanal."
"Tomorrow, the division commander will arrive to make a personal inspection of the line."
"After the inspection, we're to be relieved by a battalion of the division's reserve regiment."
"I've secured for the battalion a week's rest off the line."
That's all.
Hours like months.
Days like years.
Walked into the golden age... stood on the shores of a new world.
I would've come by and paid you guys a visit... but...
I just felt like being alone, you know.
Yeah?
We... We wanted to thank you, sir... for asking to make that flanking move... for watching out for us... keeping us together.
We're all sorry to see you go.
We feel like you got a rotten deal.
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.
The tough part is... not knowing if you're doing any good.
That's the hard part.
But it doesn't matter.
I don't care. I'm...
I'm glad to be going.
I'm glad.
There's still time.
We could file a complaint.
For what?
What good would that do?
Anyway, I want to go.
Leave it alone. Let it lay.
What does that mean, sir?
It means,
"You've been like my sons."
You are my sons.
My dear sons.
Push up.
You live inside me now.
I'll carry you wherever I go.
Can't nothing make you forget it.
Each time you start from scratch.
War don't ennoble men.
It turns 'em into dogs.
Poisons the soul.
My dear wife.
You get something twisted out of your insides... by all this blood, filth and noise.
I want to stay changeless for you.
I want to come back to you the man I was before.
How do we get to those other shores... to those blue hills?
Love.
Where does it come from?
Who lit this flame in us?
No war can put it out... conquer it.
I was a prisoner.
You set me free.
No matter how much training you got, how careful you are... it's a matter of luck whether or not you get killed.
Makes no difference who you are or how tough a guy you might be.
If you're in the wrong spot at the wrong time, you're gonna get it.
I look at that boy dying...
I don't feel nothing.
I don't care about nothing anymore.
Sounds like bliss.
I don't have that feeling yet... that numbness.
Not like the rest of you guys.
Maybe 'cause I knew what to expect.
Maybe I was just frozen up already.
I haven't touched another woman since I was called up.
Or talked to one.
I don't want to...
I don't want to feel the desire.
All right. Abrahams!
Abrahams, here you go.
Stack! Where's Stack?
Bring him out. Here.
Bell?
Bell!
Another one for Bell.
Another one for Bell.
Dear Jack...
I've met an Air Force captain.
I've fallen in love with him.
I want a divorce to marry him.
I know you can say no, but I'm asking you anyway... out of the memory of what we had together.
Forgive me.
It just got too lonely, Jack.
We'll meet again someday.
People who have been as close as we've been always meet again.
I have no right to speak to you this way.
I can't stop myself.
A habit so strong.
Oh, my friend of all those shining years... help me leave you.
What's your name?
We were a family.
How'd it break up and come apart... so that now we're turned against each other... each standing in the other's light?
How did we lose the good that was given us... let it slip away... scatter it, careless?
What's keeping us from reaching out... touching the glory?
I'd have had you, Witt, if you was a Jap... long ago.
They leave you here?
Yep.
I slowed 'em up.
Don't mind, really.
The medic, he fixed me up pretty good.
I got plenty of ammo.
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.
Yeah.
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.
What are you doing down here?
Just, you know...
I'm heading back to the company.
Yeah.
Well, you give all them boys my best.
You can come with me if you want.
I'll help you along.
Nah, it's nice and quiet... peaceful up here.
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.
I'll remind 'em.
Okay.
Hey, Witt.
Who you making trouble for today?
What do you mean?
Well, isn't that what you like to do?
Turn left when they say go right?
Why are you such a troublemaker, Witt?
You care about me, don't you, Sergeant?
I always felt like you did.
Why do you always make yourself out like a rock?
One day I can come up and talk to you.
By the next day... it's like we never even met.
Lonely house now.
You ever get lonely?
Only around people.
Only around people.
You still believing in the beautiful light, are you?
How do you do that?
You're a magician to me.
I still see a spark in you.
One man looks at a dying bird... and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.
But death's got the final word.
It's laughing at him.
Another man sees that same bird... feels the glory... feels something smiling through it.
We need to get out of here right now.
You explain to... to headquarters the situation?
- No.
- Do they know where we are?
'Cause we're sitting ducks out here.
Well, I think that's up to me to judge, Sergeant.
No, I think we just need to send somebody up there and find out how close they are.
Okay? It's easy.
Hey, Weld get headquarters on that thing.
The fire's coming closer, sir.
Line's cut.
This line?
Well, we need to send somebody out there to find out where that line is being cut... and we need to find out how close they are.
Come on.
Okay, okay.
Hey, you.
You go.
You're going, Fife.
Coombs. You go too.
- Come on.
- I'll go.
But I want you to know I think the whole thing's a bad idea though.
If they come down here in any strength, Lieutenant... they're gonna knock our position to hell and flinders.
Well, you don't have to go, Private.
There's others who'll volunteer.
No, I want to go, sir. In case something bad happens, I want to be there.
All right.
Y-You stay by the river.
That jungle's too thick.
And be very careful.
I will.
Good luck, Witt.
You okay, Fife?
A reinforced battalion.
We need to go back, tell the lieutenant.
Let's go.
I'm hit!
Do it! Split up!
Get back!
One of us needs to stay here and hold 'em off.
We'll be all right.
My friend here doesn't have long.
So, you go.
You go on ahead.
Witt.
They're coming.
I gotta go.
I don't want you to be afraid.
Just hide out here till you hear firing.
Then push on down the river.
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back. They're coming!
Fall back.
Where's Witt?
Fife, where's Witt?
Fife, where's Witt?
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?
America.
Where's your spark now?
Now, I know you men have been making and drinking this goddamn swipe.
That's okay by me.
Everything a lie.
Any man in an outfit of mine can get as drunk as he wants to every night.
Everything you hear, everything you see.
As long as he's ready and in shape to make reveille and carry out any assignment he is given.
If he can't do that, he's gonna have trouble from me.
So much to spew out.
Now, I prefer to think of myself as a family man... and that's what we all are here, whether we like it or not.
We are a family.
I'm the father.
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.
They just keep coming, one after another.
And whether you guys like it or not, that makes you all the children in this family.
Now, a family can have only one head, and that is the father.
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.
If any of you men want to see me about anything...
- You're in a box.
- Anything at all...
A moving box.
You will find that I am available.
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.
It's gonna be a long time before we get home.
They want you dead... or in their lie.
Only one thing a man can do... find something that's his... make an island for himself.
If I never meet you in this life... let me feel the lack.
A glance from your eyes... and my life will be yours.
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.
I mean, I don't know what, you know... what your plans are, but...
I'm determined now.
I've been through the thick and thin of it.
You know, I may be young, but I've lived plenty of life.
I'm ready to start living it good.
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna get a whole lot worse before it gets better.
You know, 'cause life ain't supposed to be that hard when you're young.
Well, I... I figure after this, the worst is gonna be gone though.
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.
That's what's gonna happen.
I'm getting older now.
By no means old, but older.
Where is it that we were together?
Who were you that I lived with... walked with?
The brother.
The friend.
Darkness and light.
Strife and love.
Are they the workings of one mind... the features of the same face?
O my soul... let me be in you now.
Look out through my eyes.
Look out at the things you made.
All things shining.
