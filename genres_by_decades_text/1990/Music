City by the mighty dirty river
City by the greasy rolling sea
I crawl so small
And it stands so tall
And it all belongs
To me
Welcome to Joe's apartment
It's our apartment, too
We've been around for a hundred million years
And we'll be here long after you
Let's go to our place
It's a great big space
It's where I wanna be
Where friends all meet
And life is sweet
'Cause everything's for free
It's the joint, it's a gas
It's a big fat boot in the ass
Let's toast! Raise your glass
Here's to Joe! A man with class
So! Hello from Joe's apartment
You're gonna love the view
It's a nest that beats the rest
We're so glad that you're our guest
Come on in, we're all undressed
Joe's apartment, we welcome you!
Nice singing!
The movie's starting.
Dear Mom,
I made it to New York safe and sound.
Hands up, pinhead!
Dear Mom, I made it to New York.
Hands up, pinhead!
Dear Mom--
Hands up, pinhead!
Please send money.
Don 't worry, Mom, I'll pay you back soon.
I'm bound to get a job.
I'm a college graduate.
But first things first.
I got to get an apartment.
I hope I can get one really cheap.
$1,500 a month?
There's a hole in the ceiling.
It's a private atrium.
$1,100 a month for 300 square feet.
That's a sweet deal.
No vacancy.
$1,500 a month.
Nothing for that price range.
Try Nebraska.
Oh, my God, mister. Are you all right?
Two days, seven hours, twenty-three minutes and four seconds.
That's how long I've been lying here.
Are you okay?
Of course not. I'm an artist.
I wanted to express how cold, how pitiless this city really is.
Nobody touched you for two days?
Spitting doesn't count.
You must be from out of town.
Yeah.
Iowa.
-What's your name?
-Joe.
Walter. Walter Shit.
Walter Shit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Looking for a place?
Something for $100 a month.
Hey, junior here thinks he's going to find his own rent-controlled apartment!
Rent-controlled apartment?
Yeah.
A place where the rent's been frozen since the 1950s.
Those places are hard to find because no one ever leaves them.
Not unless the landlord gives them a little help.
I love the real estate business.
They're tougher than they look.
See? There's really no way to get a rent-controlled apartment.
No way at all?
I mean, only if it's your mom's apartment... and she croaks.
How you doing, Mrs. Grotowski?
Oh, my God!
Joe, Mrs. Grotowski doesn't have any family.
You pose as her son, take her apartment.
What?
I couldn't!
Oh, my God!
Joe!
It's your mother!
And she's dead!
Thank you.
My first place!
Quiet!
Got to hide! Got to hide!
-Never seen him around before.
-Where's the old lady?
-Luggage! I don't like it!
-Stay undercover.
Right, another stupid human.
-Shut up!
-Can it, both of you.
Oh, no!
Yummy, yummy!
Damn. Ralph's out there. Poor sucker.
This is the greasiest, ugliest bug I've ever seen in my life.
-Look at that.
-Our kind of guy.
He likes good living. That's for sure.
-He's not so bad.
-He's got potential.
Did you hear that? "Greasy."
Nice compliment.
I thought you was smushed for sure.
Who's out there?
Schlomo and Pauli, who else?
-Schlomo, I quit drinking.
-Me, too, Pauli.
Ever since I joined this health club.
It's a great lap pool.
Diver down.
We're gonna get drunk.
Hold on. He's having a taste of Old Hound Dog instead.
I'll drink to that.
I can't tell you how happy I am to be finally out on my own, Mom.
No, no thanks, Mom.
I can find a job by myself.
Look how easy I got a place.
Yes, Mom.
No, Mom. Right, Mom. Good, Mom.
Isn't his mom supposed to be dead?
Landlord!
I hope everything's going fine up in heaven, Mom.
Pray to you later. Amen!
Joe, who are you talking to?
Who the hell are you?
Joe Grotowski.
Joe F. Grotowski.
Vladimir Bianco.
My cousin, Jesus.
Vlad and Jesus Bianco?
You are related?
Speaking of relations,
I knew your old lady... and she never talked you up! Not once!
-I've been away at college.
-ls that so?
Well, $50 rent, college boy.
-Cash!
-Now!
Sorry about your moms, man.
But maybe you won't be missing her long.
Amen.
Dear Mom, thanks for another loan.
I haven 't found a job yet... but I'm on the lookout for something good.
Thank you for calling 91 1.
Your call is important to us.
Please stay on the line.
Your local police precinct will be with you shortly.
Central Complaint Department, please hold.
I don't know. Please hold.
I can't help you. Please hold.
Like, who cares, man? Please hold.
Alligators in the subway.
Interesting, ma'am. Please hold.
No, sir. Don't try to saw it off yourself.
Please hold.
-Central Complaint Department.
-I'm calling from 324 1/2 East 8th Street.
No water, no heat, no power.
Roof leaking, drug dealing.
People falling out of windows?
Congratulations, sir.
This is the worst call I've had all day!
Really?
Coffee break!
Please hold.
Hello?
Lily, what's up?
Oh, Blank. Hey.
This garden of yours is really coming along.
-Quite a change from the old air shaft.
-Oh, yeah.
It's such a relief after all those calls.
It ain't bad now.
Wait till there's a riot or a fire!
Serious O.T.
I wish we could do something other than put people on hold.
What are you doing in this dead-end city department anyway?
Child, go work for your dad.
The man's a U.S. senator.
Wear a nice dress, sit next to his podium.
You could get into politics, easy.
-Mr. Bianco.
-Check it out.
Please, Senator, just call me Alberto.
Have you brought me good news, Alberto?
My second to the last tenant has just taken flight, Senator.
We two saw her off personally.
Wonderful. She'll love the condo you bought her.
Nothing is too good for my tenants.
And how about your last tenant?
We made his final arrangements.
And soon the building will be yours.
The U.S. government will have acquired the last property we need... for the brand new...
Manhattan... maximum security... federal penitentiary.
The biggest prison in the world.
Whatever happened to the Lower East Side?
How did it decay so badly... that the only thing that'll sprout in its soil... is a jail?
We can't take all the credit for that.
But we're glad we could help.
Oh, look at those kids.
They could get hurt, playing in this empty lot.
I used to get plenty of cuts and scratches... but that's all there is around here.
Hi, guys.
What are you making?
A crack house.
Oh, my God.
This is awful.
This should be a public garden, with safe places for kids to play... with flowers and trees.
Lily, this ain't no cute little building atrium.
This is the nastiest neighborhood in New York City.
Come on, girl.
-Conference.
-What's up, Ralph?
This new guy, Joe. He don't wash, clean, vacuum. He don't give a crap.
He's the dirtiest slob on the planet.
I think I'm in love.
-Me, too, Ralph.
-I vote we keep him.
We got to break him in, that's all.
Oh, my gosh!
Looks like the landlord wants to change Joe's lease.
They aren't doing no paint job.
Let's not kid ourselves.
If Joe gets greased, we're next.
I won't stand for it!
Let's teach them toe-heads some respect!
Roaches to the rescue!
I love the smell of this old couch.
-Double time! Double time!
-Hang on!
Hurry! These goons will bust Joe's skull!
He knows it, too.
-Feel him shaking?
-Spring is in the air.
-Stay cool, Joe.
-Take it easy, Joe.
Don't worry, Joe. We got your back.
Who....
Where is he?
-Troops! Antennas up!
-Sir, yes, sir!
Bombs away!
Give me a kiss, asshole.
God, they talk?
That's right!
I'm about to kick your ass, too!
Disgusting little....
Your mama's cooking sucks!
I wouldn't even touch it.
I think he got me! He got me!
I'm heading up to that big Dumpster in the sky.
You missed!
Over here, fruitcake.
Let's go!
It's a roach clip. Get it?
Now you're in trouble!
Ought to stomp your freaking head!
Slip on something more comfortable.
Hiya, Hansel and Gretel, lay off our buddy Joe.
-Okay. Just let us go, please!
-Are you listening?
Because if you ain't, you'll get a roach in every meal you'll ever have... for the rest of your freaking life!
-You got that?
-Yeah!
We know where you live!
We live where you live.
-What a fall!
-Leaving so soon?
-The party's just started!
-See you.
Hate to be you!
-A spare!
-You was robbed!
You was great, Ralphie.
What a couple of pansies.
Joe, are you all right?
Get back!
-Joe.
-Buddy!
-That ain't no way to treat your friends.
-My friends?
Sure! We like the way you run things here, so we wanted to keep you around.
You can talk.
Talk? We can sing!
Garbage
Garbage
Garbage
Sorry.
The garbage in the moonlight
Gives off a lovely smell
Sipping sewage with my baby
In our little roach motel
Please, don 't tell
On an ocean trip on a garbage ship
With a cockroach I adore
We 'll take a taste of the medical waste
That washes up on shore
Oh, sweetheart, say you love me
And crawl underneath my rug
You're one in a thousand billion, baby
Oh, won 't you be my bug?
Oh, won 't you be my bug?
Please, be my bug
God, what a nightmare.
I'm up. I'm up already.
-What's that?
-I'm trying to get some shuteye here.
Morning. My name's Ralph Roach.
This is my associate, Rodney Roach.
What's happening, Joe?
Another hot and muggy, Joe?
-What are you doing on my breakfast?
-Little nosh, that's all.
-How's it hanging today?
-Word up.
How do you like the Knicks?
How many of you are there?
This apartment? Not a lot.
About 20,000, 30,000, 40,000.
Mostly family, you know.
-And you can talk?
-Sure.
We just don't talk much.
Not to people, anyhow.
No point. People smush first, and ask questions later.
But not you, brother. You're different.
Oh, yeah?
Joe, Joe!
Let's be friends.
We just saved your life, remember?
Besides, Joe... if those two friends of yours come back, we might come in useful.
So, how about a live-and-let-live philosophy here?
"Slobs of a feather swarm together."
-Makes sense to me.
-That's fair.
-What's yours is ours.
-Stereo rights?
Just warn us before you flush.
I got to get out of here.
-Where are you going?
-None of your business.
-Mind if we hang out with you?
-Yes!
-Come on!
-Don't be that way, Joey!
Can't we? Please?
-You won't even notice us.
-We'll be good.
What's up his butt?
We ought to keep an eye on him, in case he needs our help.
-Right as usual, Ralph.
-Excellent idea, Ralph.
Ritardo's!
Come on in. The cheese is fine.
You're fired!
Here are your enlargements, sir.
You're fired!
You're fired!
-You're fired!
-You're fired!
Poor Joe. Having trouble keeping a job.
We're doing our best to help.
Guess we got to keep on trying.
-Love this guy! Breakfast?
-Don't mind if I do.
-Don't panic or nothing.
-What do you mean?
Well, it appears to me... that one of our most dreaded natural enemies somehow got in!
Oh, my God!
Joe, wake up! A cat!
Don't let it get me!
How's everybody doing tonight?
Thank you! Good-looking crowd.
Anybody here from New Jersey?
What exit?
He's dying out there.
Some pretty cool cats from there:
Sinatra, Bruce.
Say, nice set of whiskers, sir.
Poor Ralphie. I can't look!
It's Cousin Tiny from Texas!
Howdy, cousins! Just buzzing through!
Let's have ourselves a little rodeo!
It's chicken-pickin ', finger-lickin ' good
I got my honey in a sunny neighborhood
It's a wrassling, hassling, dazzling show
Grab a lady and do-si-do
A little bitty kitty-cat rodeo
Scrape it, Clyde!
Now you ought to bring your daughter
'cause it's hotter
When he's shaking and a-baking and breaking it in
He's a-gripping, he's a-slipping
Come on, mister, bring your sister
Bring her to the rodeo
Go, Joe!
-Go, Joe!
-Attaboy, Joe!
-Look at those claws digging into his face!
-That's got to hurt!
Good arm, Joe! Good arm!
You saved my life!
No human being has ever saved the life of a cockroach.
This is a breakthrough in "interspecio" diplomacy!
Yeah? Well, stop following me to work already!
-For God's sake!
-You got it, Joe.
-Forget about it.
-Don't worry.
We don't follow you to work no more.
Yeah, right. I've heard that before.
Give me a "J"! Give me an "O"! An "E"!
-What's that spell?
-Joe!
-What's that spell?
-Joe!
Dear Mom, the job situation has been a little tricky.
But I know I'm going to land something soon.
Congratulate me.
This is the first of my works to use paint!
I call this piece lnstant Minority.
I did the whole block.
But people are black or white or brown.
Nobody's purple!
Periwinkle!
You're now the world's smallest minority.
How am I supposed to get a job looking like this?
-You know how to play drums?
-No.
Perfect! You want a job?
I'm doing a musical performance.
You can sit in for my drummer. He's dead.
Well, sure.
What? He's dead?
Actually, it's a very funny story.
There's a crack dealer in our building and my drummer called him--
Slit his throat so badly that his own mom couldn't identify him at the morgue.
I'll miss that guy.
Is it a deal?
Excellent. Here. You can put these up.
That's a cool name for a band.
Shit.
-Hi.
-Hi.
It's a band.
What is?
This.
That's nice.
I'm the drummer.
We kick ass.
I guess you must.
What are those for?
It's a community garden.
We'll plant flowers and have a playground for kids, vegetables for families.
Cool.
Yeah, but the lot is totally bare of soil.
We'll need fertilizer.
-Fertilizer?
-Yeah, a lot of it.
And then I saw your sign. I thought... that is exactly what we need.
Well, maybe I can help out.
Wonderful. I'm Lily.
I'm Joe.
Dear Lily, it was great to meet you.
I'm into gardening, too.
I can plant trees, weed flowers, dig bulbs....
Boobs, Joe, not bulbs!
Tell her you dig her boobs!
Dames like compliments!
Nothing like the sight of a woman with a sack of grubs hanging off her abdomen.
Can't you see
I'm trying to have some privacy?
Hey, Joe, what's this idea you people keep kicking about "privacy"?
Explain it to us. We don't get it.
People need to be alone sometimes.
That's a false philosophic concept.
-You are never alone.
-Not in New York City.
Us roaches see everything you do.
So what? We're all friends here.
Okay. Fine. Shut up.
Oh, I like that.
-"Shut up," he says.
-Shut up yourself.
-No manners, this guy.
-Who needs you?
-So long, Romeo.
-I bet she's a dog.
Dear Lily, I want to help your garden.
That's "plow your garden," Joe.
Tell her you want to plow her.
I said shut up already!
Come on, Joe!
Dames secretly like it when you give them shit.
We need fertilizer. Lots ofit.
What are you doing?
Giving you a neck rub.
You seem a little tense.
-Okay, okay! We're gone!
-Chill out.
Wait.
Hey, get out!
You've got to be more careful with those enthusiastic greetings.
I'm an old man.
Oh, Daddy.
I got a call from your job supervisor the other day.
He told me that you're spending a lot of time in that little atrium of yours.
But I must insist....
Tell me where you got those earrings.
Saks.
The atrium is just a dry run for my first big project.
What? I'm sorry, a project? What project?
I'm starting a community garden in the East Village.
That's nice. Whereabouts?
East 8th Street in Avenue B.
In your old neighborhood.
Isn't this great, Daddy?
Pumpkin...
I'm building a federal prison on that site.
A prison?
In the middle of the East Village?
Why not? With all the crime and drugs, it's already a prison.
Not until my 30-day gardening permit expires.
And by that time,
I'll have the whole East Village behind me.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have some mulching to do.
Hey, what's that smell?
-It's odoriferous.
-It's "splendoriferous."
-Joe, you are a prince among men.
-Always thinking of your buddies.
Letter for Ralph.
-Mail call!
-Anything for me?
-Letter for Rodney.
-A postcard from Uncle Sid.
How is Tampa?
Garbage magazine?
-Thanks a bunch, Joe!
-My sex toy arrived yet?
Junk mail, junk mail.
Hey, one for me.
-It's from Mom.
-No kidding.
-How is the old bag?
-Be respectful.
Joe knows I'm kidding!
"Dear Joe, got you a job interview with P.I. Smith & Sons.
"The boss is my old high school classmate."
-P.I. Smith & Sons? Great company.
-You've heard of them?
They're the biggest manufacturer in New York.
What do they make?
When I was about your age,
I woke up one morning and said to myself:
"Urinal cake.
"That's the future."
So...
I decided to aim for men's room manufacturing.
Now I'm the richest man in the urinal sanitation industry.
Twenty million men piss on my name everyday.
That's great, sir.
So, you're an lowa boy, like me.
Yes, sir. Went to Murchison High School.
Good old Murchison.
"Go, Bullfrogs! "
My mom could do that cheer really well.
She was a varsity cheerleader.
I remember.
Your mom was the hottest tomato in school.
Does your mom still wear her hair in that sexy way?
Does mischief still sparkle in her eye... that minx?
Mommy still got that saucy swing to her hips?
Did Mommy ever give you... a sponge bath?
Welcome to the research department for P.I. Smith & Sons.
You will play an essential role in our quest for the perfect urinal cake:
Used product retrieval.
Your first assignment, retrieve all used product from the restrooms... at 58 East 161st Street, the Bronx.
Deliver them to the research department for testing.
58 East 161st Street.
58 East 161st....
Joe's here!
Let him watch. He's okay.
What's this?
Channel R.
The roach public access channel.
You roaches have your own channel?
Shut up!
Are you ready for something itsy-bitsy, baby?
Come and get it, you greasy little tick.
Oh, my God! I'm going to pupate!
You so fine, baby.
Bloats up your crop, don't it, Joe?
Hey, Joe!
-What is it now?
-You seem a little down.
Are you okay?
Just great.
I'm lonely, my job sucks... and I'm in love with a girl who's got a boyfriend.
My life has totally turned to shit.
Funny thing about shit, Joe.
-Good stuff grows out of it.
-Yeah, right.
You don't believe me?
Check out that bag in the corner.
Where do you want this stupid bush?
Right over there.
Isn't this great, Blank?
This is not my thing.
Why did I say yes to this?
For you.
Elephicalia vermilius?
I did my senior thesis on this flower.
It's only found in Sri Lankan elephant habitats.
It loves rotting, moist conditions.
You know....
It's a terrific planting for the garden.
Good.
Thanks.
What's "P.I.S. & S?"
It's the bank I work for.
"Prudential lnvestment Stocks and Security Savings...."
I thought you played in a band.
I do.
But... banking is kind of like my trade.
I'm sort of a rock-and-roll banker.
You wear these overalls to work?
What's this?
Those are super-mulching pellets.
Great for growing things.
-I've never seen them before.
-It's a new technology.
Could you get some of these for the garden?
As many as you want!
Thank you.
You're great.
On one condition:
You come see my band tomorrow night.
I can put you on the list.
I don't know.
Come on.
Can't resist a man in a uniform.
Thank you for tuning into Alternative Life.
New York's only truly underground forum.
We continue last week's discussion:
"How can we promote better understanding between species?"
Lay off the rat jokes!
How many rats does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How'd you like a punch in the beak, wise guy?
Lay off the bird, sewer breath!
Go gnaw some nuts!
Can 't we all just get along?
No!
Now, guys--
-Out of the way.
-We're watching Charlie Roach.
I've got a date tonight.
Is she cute?
-About time, Joey!
-Porkola time, buddy.
-So I want you to stay out of sight.
-Who, us?
-Sure, Joey.
-No problem, Joe.
-You got the place to yourself.
-We're Gandhi.
I'll forget every horrible thing you've ever done to me if you disappear tonight.
-Just disappear.
-We're on the same team.
Forget about it.
I mean it.
Thanks, Joe.
Look at that piece of meat.
That is some dope shit, Joe.
Look at that, Joe!
-That hit the spot.
-Complements to the chef.
Joe's first date!
Let's make it special.
-Great idea, Ralph.
-Special, sure.
I'm in favor.
Come on, buddy, that's it.
Let's get him over the curb.
Mr. Smith?
It's a hostile takeover.
Ten minutes ago this company became a wholly-owned subsidiary... of Featherstone Feminine Products.
They're going to shut down the whole urinal cake division!
Don't forget to take this.
This way, gentlemen. Roll it over here.
My whole life's work!
Ruined!
That's right.
The days of trickle-down economics are over.
Ladies and gentlemen. It's loud, it's bad... it's Shit!
Easy crowd.
Oh, a new drummer.
Yeah, I hope he's good.
Hit it!
I'm sorry!
There won't be any rock-and-roll tonight.
This is all that's left!
This feeble wimped-out death rattle... is all that remains of the rolling thunder... of America's heartbeat!
It wasn't that bad.
Yes, it was.
Maybe you should stick to banking, after all.
I'm not a banker. I'm not a drummer.
I can't even keep a job collecting urinal cakes.
I'm just... nothing.
I think you're something.
-Why aren't you with your boyfriend?
-What boyfriend?
The guy I saw you kiss in the garden a few days ago.
He's probably home kissing my mother.
He's my dad.
The lot is completely planted.
The community is behind it, the flowers are starting to bloom.
Now I just have to show it to my father... and show him something good can come out of the neighborhood... and it's worth saving.
Do you want to come to my place?
I've got a towel you could use.
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk
Baby, I got the love
Baby, I got the power
Come on, girl, and rock my world
And my funky towel
Baby, got the love
Baby, got the howl
Let's get down to party town
And my funky towel
Thick and funky
Steamin ' up the dance floor
Get on up and shake that thing
Everybody's gettin ' what they ask for
Everybody, everybody, sing
Sing, sing, sing
Welcome to Joey's toilet
-Make yourself at home.
-Thanks.
I've got a towel....
What are you doing?
Having a party, what does it look like?
I'm serious. I want you out of here!
-Joe, my brother!
-Thanks, Joey!
-What say there?
-Bust a move.
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk
Okay, I'm dancing. Now, beat it. Leave.
You just flushed the rhythm section out to Coney lsland.
So follow them out there. Lily's here.
She is?
My towels are in the laundry.
Oh, that's fine.
So... do you live here alone?
Yep. Nobody here but us.
Guys, you promised.
Come on, baby, light my fire.
-Up periscope.
-Music, maestro.
How about a smooch, baby?
Your place is so comfy.
Shut up.
I mean... drink up.
Down the hatch, sweetie.
Here's to life's little surprises.
I think you'll need one of these, Joe.
Pretzel nugget?
Bon appetit.
What a lover!
A real Casanova.
Go get her.
I beg your pardon?
Feeling better?
Well, I'm... still a little wet.
-What's going on?
-Don't push.
I'm sorry. I hope you don't catch cold.
-She wants it.
-I smell victory.
At least it wasn't a downpour.
Steady there!
-Steady!
-Don't tip it!
Let me out of here!
No, no! Wait!
Oh, my God!
Lily, come back!
Oh, my God.
My garden.
My father was right.
This place does deserve to be a prison.
The East Village sucks!
We're really sorry, man.
-We're sorry.
-We didn't mean it.
Tough break, buddy.
We didn't know.
Beer, Joe? Oh, sorry.
She'll never speak to me again.
Come on. There'll be others, Joe.
I don't want any others. I want Lily.
I want to die.
Look on the bright side.
You always got us.
All right.
That's it.
I'm getting rid of you roaches once and for all.
Wait. Don't be rash.
I'll kill every last one of you!
We're family!
Well, I guess this means war.
Joe, let's talk.
This is all I have to say to you, Ralph.
-He's got a bomb!
-Run for your lives!
No! Don't do it!
My babies! My babies!
One, two, three, heave!
Heave!
Careful, soldier, don't lose your head.
Oh, Joe's little dolly got hurt.
Red alert!
Armored force, attack!
Let her go!
Timber!
-What the....
-Hello, Joe.
Now can we talk?
-You go first.
-No, you go first.
Goddamn, you little sons of bitches!
Get the hell out of my apartment!
Listen to that.
-Your apartment?
-I believe we were here first.
We'll be here last, too.
We got a long-term lease on this planet.
Roaches will be crawling on the daisy popping out of the last rotting human.
God, you're disgusting!
Like you humans are any kind of fucking prize!
What makes you so much better than us?
War, pollution, New Age music!
I suppose those things are our fault?
We just want to say two things. First:
We're sorry we ruined your life. Second:
Goodbye.
-Toodles.
-Sayonara.
What do you mean "goodbye"?
-We took a big risk talking to you.
-Since you faked our friendship... you can't walk off knowing what you know.
Painful decision, Joe.
Wait!
Here, roachy, roachy.
Going to miss you.
I was kidding.
-Any last words?
-Don't kill me.
Those are the last words?
Ready! Aim!
Ralph! Rodney!
Help!
Big deal. Please hold.
So what? Please hold.
Don't make me laugh. Please hold.
No, ma'am.
I think you should take the shrapnel out before you cauterize.
-I don 't think I can do it.
-Please hold.
Central Complaint Department.
I'd like to speak to Lily Dougherty.
Lily's not here.
Will she be back soon?
No. She's sick.
Sick?
She's sick of her job.
And she's sick of New York City.
And she's sick of having her stupid daydreams dashed to pieces.
And what makes her sickest... is the unspeakably rotten things some people do to other people... just when she was beginning to like them!
Lily, is that you?
No.
Lily quit.
Lily, it's Joe!
Lily!
Ralph!
Rodney!
I don't care if you can hear me or not, Ralph!
But you can keep this goddamn city!
I'm going back to lowa!
Here's a souvenir to take with you.
So long, sucker.
I love the real estate business.
The place looks great.
Sure it does, Ralph. Where's Joe?
Around here someplace, I suppose.
Joe!
Joe, speak to me!
Who did this to you?
We did, Ralph. We ran out on him just when he needed us most.
We behaved no better than a bunch of people.
We got to make it up to him.
Let's find him a new place.
We got to get Lily back, too.
Forget that, I'm a cockroach, not Santa Claus.
Ralphie, I'm surprised at you.
Does this mean you're giving up?
Give up? Give up?
What are you saying to me?
How come us roaches have been able to outlast the dinosaurs?
How do we survive poison and persecution?
How do we keep on crawling in the face of the world in arms?
How?
I'll tell you how.
Because we never give up!
A true cockroach never gives up!
They can stomp us, they can pop us, but they'll never ever stop us!
Some day, the great H-bomb will drop, and we'll have the planet to ourselves!
I don't care if we call in favors from every roach, rat and pigeon in New York.
We aren't giving up on Joe!
-Great speech, Ralph!
-Truly righteous, brother.
Where's the stapler?
-I need five copies.
-How do you spell "memorandum"?
Boot it up.
Anybody got a 1942 W-440?
Special delivery.
This is giving me hay fever.
Hey, watch the potholes, homes.
Excuse me, sir. Mind if we borrow this?
Tubular!
Wash out!
Sewer surfing
Under-turfing
We get our kicks while we're hanging six
On a sewer surfing holiday
We're surfing, we're sewer surfing
Shoo-shoo
Shooting the tube
We are going to get there
Shooting the tube
Hitting the loo
We're dirtier than you
We are shooting the tube
Are you sure this is the right address?
Yes, Daddy.
"324 1/2 East 8th Street.
"Prison dedication, 9:00 a.m."
Funny, I could have sworn this was an empty lot.
-Hi, Lily.
-Joe!
What's all this?
I guess it's sort of... mine.
And I'm giving it to you.
Is it okay?
It's wonderful, but how did you....
My friends helped.
I see.
Lily, you were right.
This park will do more for the Lower East Side than 1,000 prisons.
My boy, you've done my old neighborhood a great service.
It was all her idea, Senator.
Come on.
My friends... this extraordinary garden... is the first blossom of this neighborhood's rebirth.
What is this?
Kill that lying, two-timing Senator Dougherty. Tonight.
Whack his daughter and that damn kid, too.
See all these people here?
Dead by the end of the week.
And that little girl over there--
Mr. Shirt!
Let me show you a hot new property.
Welcome to Lily Park!
There's an extra toothbrush in the cupboard.
Oh, really, don't bother.
It's the least I could do.
Your house burned down.
I'll set you up on the couch.
Joe, you're practically inside.
Ralph!
-Little last minute advice.
-Get lost, Ralph!
Look into her eyes and say:
"Baby, I'm going to bop you till your ears bleed! "
Did you need something?
No, thanks.
Play your cards right, Joe, and this could be our new pad.
"Our new pad"? You little....
We busted ass for you!
What kind of thanks do we get?
Ralph... thanks.
For everything.
Forget it. Sorry about our little misunderstanding back there.
Me, too. Now, how about a little privacy?
Take my advice, just grab her by--
Gosh, Lily, you look incredible.
-How about a little help here?
-No. I mean it.
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen in my life.
I bet you say that to all the girls the minute you get them alone.
We are alone, aren't we?
Last I looked.
Oh, please, let me.
I can make the bed myself.
Really? Have you ever made a bed in your life?
Sure, watch this.
Swinging pad!
What do you think, Rodney?
Brother Ralph...
I believe that we have finally reached the promised penthouse!
Brother bugs and sister insects!
Come on with it, Rodney!
Give a shout out to the Great Big Bug.
With his help, we can turn this antiseptic sanctuary... into a putrid paradise!
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, pull me through
Pull me through
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, pull me through
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, till I join that golden horde
I'll be hanging
Hanging onto you
Lily, now that we're alone,
I should tell you...
I'm sorry about what happened at my apartment.
My friends are sorry, too.
Friends?
I never thought I'd say this, but they're actually kind of sweet.
They must like you a lot.
Not as much as I like you.
Go, Joe!
We've been battered
And we've been scattered
We've been splattered into goo
-But the healer, he took my feeler
-Praise the Lord, hallelujah!
And he really pulled me through
-Oh, he pulled me through
-Oh, that feeler
When I cash my chips and pay the dealer
I'll be holding onto the Lord's feeler, too
Hold my feeler
And my antenna, too
I've been down and I've been trampled
And dug myself down deep in a hole
But I was lifted
By the love of that Great Big Bug
With his feelers 'round my soul
Whoa, Lord
Won 't you hold my feeler?
Hold my feeler and pull me through
I want you to feel my feeler!
My Lord, there 's nothing realer
Joe, that tickles.
Than my ever-loving feeler feeling you
So! So long from Joe's apartment
We're sad to see you go
Thanks for coming, it's been swell
Check back into our motel
Hope you didn 't mind the smell
Joe's apartment our own sweet home
I wanted to say you move like an Angel.
Thank you
But it's more than that.
You give, but not too much.
Your presence on stage is like an actor on film.
Walk, just walk.
It's difficult to do.
So let's walk forwards.
Now I feel I can't walk at all!
Find your center.
London
Good morning.
Coffee, and a... a croissant?
Any in black?
Black? Yes, I have black too.
Another nice model.
I'll be right back.
It was a real pleasure.
Good dancer!
Good morning.
Lots of Faxes, huh?
Do you think people's paths cross for a reason?
It depends if you believe in chance or destiny.
What do you believe?
I believe chance gives us the opportunity to create our destiny.
How?
With our will.
A question.
You believe in God?
Good luck in Hollywood!
I'm abandoning my film.
Really, Why?
I don't like the script.
Wasn't it your idea?
I wrote a film
I wouldn't want to make.
So what will you do?
I don t know.
Something more personal.
Maybe something about tango.
I didn't notice how late it was.
Where are you?
I waited where we said.
No, I'm sure we said...
OK, fine, it doesn't matter.
Good night.
Who is it?
We should define our relationship more clearly... set some limits.
I agree.
You know, I also wanted to say something.
I've had difficult experiences before... when I mixed the professional and the personal
It's dangerous.
It can be.
It can destroy everything.
You know,
I think
It's better to sublimate our attraction into our work.
Let go!
Stop thinking.
Less tension.
Do less
I'm not doing anything.
Your blocking... leaning.
Doing too much... using too much force.
Just center yourself.
Why are you moving your head?
Follow me here.
Here!
Couldn't you encourage me instead of... criticizing me...
I'm trying... I'm really trying.
You simply let go.
Let go! Let go!
I'm trying to!
-Yes, I know.
-I'll let go.
You're doing it alone.
Wait for me.
Very good
Alright
More direct.
More prepared.
More direct.
No, don't move your arm.
There's a moment... as if it stops...
Stay there... That's the idea.
Stay there?
-Why are you stopping?
-Because you are.
I'm not, I'm ready!
You are stopping.
That's it.
-Better?
-Much better.
It was very good.
For the first time.
Very good.
Why are you afraid of me?
I'm not afraid of you, but of your weakness.
What weakness?
Your emotional weakness.
I'm not weak, I'm expressive.
Could I direct films if I were weak?
I've never seen you direct.
What?
You don't know how to recognize what I do.
I have eyes.
I haven't seen you do anything.
You don't know how to use your eyes.
You only want to be looked at.
Not to look.
That's why you don't see.
That's why you know nothing about film!
You know nothing about tango.
You know nothing about me.
Maybe I don’t want to know anymore!
Then it's over between us.
What is?
Exactly!
You've been using me... to live out your little fantasies.
Bullshit!
Sure. Anything else?
Ladies and gentlemen... after 7 years, our very own Pablito Veron is back!
A big round of applause for Pablo Veron!
You really don’t know what kind of film it will be?
Not yet.
What did you tell the producers?
Lies.
All right, Pablo.
Shall I teach you something?
Yes, of course.
Say to me, I am a dancer.
I am...
Why? You know that already.
Suppose I write a scene. where I tell something important to me... that I feel I am a Jew.
And I say to you,
And you, Pablo?
And you reply, I'm a dancer.
Pause...
And you add, And a Jew.
I might say that.
Then a tear rolls down my cheek...
And a tear rolls down your cheek.
A tear?
Maybe I don't want to do that.
Maybe I don't want to cry.
Anything else you don’t want to do?
Tell me now, because maybe
I don't want you in the film.
Maybe I don't want to be in your little film.
Fine, then I'll start looking for someone else.
Gallo ciego.
Pugliese.
Where are you from?
London
And you know our tangos?
Why not?
You have to have lived... suffered... to understand our tangos.
Tell me...
Are you alone?
Is it true you're going to make a film about Tango?
With Pablo?
Dance studio?
Dance studio?
This is it!
I can rent you... this half.
Perfect, right?
What's going on?
Nothing.
You seem different.
We're working, remember?
You seem absent somehow.
Did you enjoy dancing last night? it won’t be possible.
Are you sure?
It's closed. Nobody’s here.
How about later?
I don't think so.
We'll wait.
And also,
I don't belong in France but I don't belong here either.
I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
Of being someone without roots.
I don't know where I come from nor where I'm going.
I'm afraid I'll disappear... without leaving a trace.
Perhaps that's why we met.
Oh, yeah! That was for all you pinheads too hip to take off yourjackets in the 95º heat.
When the weather gets like this it brings all you nutbags out, and since l am a trouble magnet, l have one thing to say to you bozos: back off.
Here's the Sons of Thunder from their album
Scrambled Eggs and Wobbly Legs.
This is lan the Shark on the station with more hair, more flair, yet so debonair: KPPX.
Rebel Radio!
Hey! Hey! You've gotta check in here!
Get Security on the second floor.
We've got a bogey in elevator one. lt's that guy in the delivery uniform again.
OK, be wild. Be as wild as you wanna. lf you feel like wetting yourself, go with it,
OK? Anarchy's good. They like anarchy, OK?
- But what are we supposed to say?
- What? Don't say anything.
Jeez, do you wanna blow this? You know how much these stupid hats set me back?
- Hi.
- Oh, no. Hey, excuse me?
Mike, it's him. The wacko's back.
Yeah, l'm up here in A&R right now. l'm not goin' anywhere.
Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, hi. Are you an executive here?
- Yeah.
How you doin'?
My name's Chazz. Chazz Darby. l'm in this band and we've got this incredibly sweet demo. l think you should hear it. l can't take that tape from you. lt's called unsolicited material.
Hey, but this is the real thing, man. This is rock'n'roll. None of that gimmicky stuff. l would love to hear it, but if it's unsolicited, l can't touch it.
We've been trying to get solicited...
Well, then maybe a gimmick would help.
The cream always rises, OK?
Super-duper. Thanks.
All right, dude. Thanks a lot. Whoa!
You again!
You just can't learn, can you, scumbag?
Take care now.
Here's your tape.
Hey. How was your day?
Oh, Gary is a tremendous asshole.
He had this whole stack of invoices and he made me arrange them by date.
- He's such a tweaker.
- lt sucks.
- Did you mail the rent?
- You, uh... you didn't leave me a stamp.
Well, maybe you could have gone and bought one.
Chazz! What the hell happened to my make-up? lt fell in the toilet.
Shit! Babe, come on.
- l told you not to leave it on the tank.
- You ruined my make-up, butt!
What's this attitude, Kayla?
Know what l've been through today? l guess you woke up when the sun was warm and rode your Harley up and down Melrose impressing all the 15-year-old girls, right? l was down at Palatine Records.
That's where l was.
Really? What happened? l had a meeting with a big record executive and, uh...
What did he say? Why didn't you tell me?
Well, we talked about solicitation and the guy said he'd snap us up in a second if it weren't for the lawyers.
- Did he like the tape?
- l was about to give it to him, then a security guard showed up and ruined everything.
- Come on.
- Please.
Hey, it's true. l'm making really good contacts. l am.
When they hear this song they'll go apeshit. lt's just gonna take time. What's the big deal?
The ''big deal'' is that l'm doing the bullshit work and you're living the rock'n'roll life.
- l wanna live the life, too.
- l'm doing this for us.
Come on, babe. You know that once l make it you got a free ride. l'm gonna treat you like gold.
Chazz, it's been months.
Maybe you should get ajob.
This is my job. l am trying managers, record executives, club owners. That's hard work.
You get to sit in a nice office all day smoking and drinking coffee.
- Oh!
- This is bullshit!
- Oh, my snout.
- You bastard! l hate you. You are nobody and you are never gonna be anybody.
You're treating me like l'm a goober after l wrote this song for you?
You wrote that song before you even met me.
- So?
- So you get out!
Get out now! Get lost!
- OK, OK, OK, OK. Kayla!
- Go!
- Keep going!
- Kayla!
You poser! l always knew you were a loser!
Everyone warned me! l hate your music! l always have!
She booted you out again, huh?
What a bitch. l mean, that that happened.
Hey, she's gonna be jealous in six months from now when we're on the cover of Rip magazine lookin' cool.
- Shut up.
- l'm just sayin'.
- Rex.
- What? l told you to stock the end caps and mop the employee lounge.
- Too late. l'm outta here.
- l'll tell Covington.
Oh, be quiet.
Hey, Chazz, what's up?
- He's movin' in with us for a while.
- Great! We can rock out after breakfast.
Things are gonna happen to us no matter what that chimp from Palatine Records says.
You see, that's just it. You think everything's gonna happen to you.
You gotta make it happen.
How many practices have you missed cos you're cleaning up some stiff's pool?
Get in the truck, dingus. l'll be right there.
Man, Chazz is right. All we gotta do is make our own action, you know?
That's the way it is, little bro.
D'you think Tommy Lee waited for the bus?
Man, he hustled. That's how come he gets to pork Heather Locklear.
Yeah, well, we got the look, man.
We're gonna be huge.
Yeah, we're almost there.
Chazz says once we get a contract, chicks with breast implants pick out your clothes.
Cover your mouth.
You're shooting phlegm all over my ass.
Say ''gesundheit''. l say it for you, man.
Honey, l'm home.
- Hey, Pip, check this out.
- Oh! Oh!
The lncredible Crash Dummies. Whoo!
You must have five-fingered most of the store by now.
Oh, man. Most of these guns are discontinued anyway.
Like this Uzi water pistol.
They got rid of it cos it looked too real.
- Yo!
- Mama.
Wow. Now you got yourself a whole arsenal here.
What are you doing?
Pepper sauce. Active ingredient: capsicum.
You blast this in somebody's face and they're all like ''Oh! Oh!''
Some Hollywood Boulevard trash comes shimmying up the rain pipe...
- Hey!
- Whoa!
Listen up, you lowlifes, what the hell are we doin' here on a Thursday night?
That's right.
Rock'n'roll!
OK, we're here to party tonight with our little buddies, the Sons of Thunder.
Sons of Thunder? Didn't we blow them off the stage at Chez Bang six months ago?
So why don't all you little idiots press your faces up against the speakers and blow your brains out!
Look at this crap. What do we give away first, hats or hair-care products?
Girls, you wanna get us a couple of drinks, please?
Ooh, serious bumper.
You wanna punch it up, lan?
You're as spunky as a corpse.
The Sons of Thunder, for Christ's sake? Pablum.
- How can you even tell these bands apart?
- l read the trades.
First of all l'd like to say thanks to lan and Rebel Radio for playing our single and basically getting us signed. ls this on?
? Don't hate me
Look at them stupid pantaloons.
- That's what we gotta do.
- Looks like they got a load in them pants.
No, they played this song on the radio, and they got an album. That's what we gotta do.
? Your lips are full, your head is empty
? This faded Valentine is what you sent me
All we've got to do is get 'em to play the tape and we're golden.
- This is never gonna work.
- Pip, what is your problem?
Remember that guy Doper Greg?
Remember that guy, man?
He used to blow bong hits in his iguana's face and make the thing watch cartoons.
- So what? Will you shut up?
- Just get to the point. What?
He won a radio giveaway and when he went to the station they wouldn't let him in. lt was like this total security building. They slid his ticket through a slot with salad tongs.
So just because that anus couldn't get in means that we can't? lf anybody gives us any static, l shove this in their face.
Agh!
But remember that fat kid on Hard Copy with a toy gun?
The cop zapped him with a Taser till he went bald.
Then he sued for a million bucks when his pubes didn't grow.
He's still got no hair on his balls, man.
Go to the back.
- lt's locked.
- Pip, give me your bank card.
- Come on, let's go. l'll get this door open.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Piece of cake. Watch this.
- What's your secret code?
- Huh? What for?
That's how these things work.
- l can't tell you my code.
- Will you tell him the code? And hurry up.
You punch it in, OK?
Please don't look.
- Hey! The thing took my card!
- Oh, shit.
All right. Stand back.
What are you doing, MacGyver?
Open it up. l'm gonna short-circuit it.
- Nah.
- We almost got in. That's too bad. Let's go.
- Hey, Pip, you quitting on us?
- The door's locked.
You flake! You don't care about this band.
You run around all day in your fudgies.
- Not true.
- lt is too!
- l always gotta tell you to put pants on.
- He's making this up!
Will you both shut up, please?!
OK. You're brothers, all right?
We haven't lucked out yet. Stay here, Pip.
Agh! You got a big mouth, man!
Hey, Pip.
Oh, my God.
Pip. Pip.
Oh, my... Here.
Are you all right? Cos l'm really sorry. l just came out for a cigarette.
- lt's all right. Don't worry about it.
- l'm really sorry. l just came out and bonk!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Suzzi, caller 50 needs some tickets.
Shit. l gotta go. Bye.
Yeah! Sweetness.
Come on.
There we go.
You wanna make a change, right? Get serious
about your look at Hair Bomb on Melrose.
- What, Doug?
- Um, here, see. lt's all there.
Colouring, razor cuts, popcorn, perms and
weaves. lt brings out the rock star in you.
- Well, this is beautiful.
- Well, l try to be a team player. l may need you to come in tomorrow. l'm cutting loose some dead weight.
There'll be a lot going on.
Oh, boy.
- What's the problem?
- Well, l've been having a little bit of, uh,
- itching on my... lt could be haemorrhoids.
- l don't wanna hear that. l know. lt's just that l made an appointment with my proctologist to get some type of cream or something.
So you're gonna leave me high and dry?
That's a nice team attitude.
Well, l suppose l could come in for most of Saturday.
- And Sunday.
- Well, yeah, yeah.
Now, when are you planning on breaking this to everyone? l thought l'd wait for exactly the right moment. l mean, these things require a certain measure of delicacy.
? Are you ready
? To rumble?
Sunday! Swamp motorcycle racing at its best.
The USSCA brings you the ultimate
in swamp-race action.
60,000 cubic feet of
muddy slop poured into...
Hey.
We're a band.
Of course. The Partridge Family.
Which one of you is Laurie?
- Get out.
- We came to talk to you about a demo tape.
We were wondering if you could set us up like you did with the Sons of Thunder.
How did you morons get in?
They've got electronic locks on the doors.
We had to break in.
- This place is sealed up like a dolphin's butt.
- Watertight!
Let me get this straight.
You guys are an unsigned band, and you broke into the radio station to get your demo played on the air?
- That's about the skinny of it.
- And what sound are you megastars of the future hip to?
What is your musical vibe?
- Well...
- That's a good question.
- We could play anything.
- Not that slap-bass noise. l hate that.
- lt's more like a power slop.
- But we don't limit ourselves to labels.
There's always someone who wants to lump
you together with the other buttholes.
This is one of the things
we're struggling against.
- l'm telling you, it is tough.
- This guy knows. l got booted out of Palatine Records, my girlfriend kicks me out of the apartment...
Well, l'm sorry. l'm just trying to conjure up
the kind of woman
who would go out with you.
She's not like what you'd think.
She's actually really cool
and, well, l guess what it all comes down to
is that we really care about each other and l screwed up. She's been there for me from the beginning. l think l let her down, but l still want us to be tight.
Uh-oh, l think we're busted.
- What did l do now?
- Get these guys out. Are we still on air?
Milo, l get six minutes of talk an hour.
What do you care how l spend them?
Get these morons off the air. l'm warning you.
- Ease up. Somebody gave you a break once.
- Even though you're a goon. l say we make this an open forum.
Let's hear the man out.
Go ahead, Conan. Explain to Milo why we should play your tape. l'm not pulling pud here.
My entire life force is on this tape and l don't know what else to say.
Come on, man, can you give us a shot?
- How can you say no to that?
- You're on thin ice. You're not untouchable.
- You think you are, but you're not.
- Get out. Without me you have no ratings.
We'll see about that.
Let's go. Out! All you losers.
- Get your hands off me, Jackson.
- You wanna try gettin' physical with me?
Listen, you shaved ape, l could have you picking up garbage for the rest of the decade.
You wanna get smart with me? Try it. l will not be pushed around by Hollywood Boulevard trash like you. l'm trash?
You think you're better than me? Huh?
- Oops.
- He's got a gun! He's got a gun!
Hey, stop squirming, pussy! l'll fill your face so full of lead, you'll be shitting bullets for a week!
- Come on, Rex.
- Shut up.
- lan, you wanna talk to these fellas?
- What do you suggest?
- Say something. They like you.
- Shut up, dick-smoke!
Chazz, come on.
All right. You would've been cool, but then this penis had to step in and get heavy.
All we wanna do is to be heard, and then go.
Believe me, l understand. Just cool it, huh?
Why don't you cut your losses?
You're in over your head.
Shut your face! Just shut your stupid face! l know exactly what l'm doing.
That's the problem with you guys. You think cos you have a big job you know something.
- Wrong! You got Hagar slacks, a pony-nub.
- Bet it ain't even real.
Hey, hey, hey. Just cool it, huh?
Hey, guys, we're all rock'n'rollers here.
You look like half a butt-puppet that...
Do you know what it's like to be on the bill, play for 15 minutes, and the only people there are the other bands?
Don't talk to me about rock'n'roll! l'm out there in the clubs living it! l am rock'n'roll! lt's guys like you and Jimmie Wing that ruin everything
- for everyone.
- Jimmie, they're talking about you on KPPX.
Come here.
Then you realise there's a million
of these Jimmie Wing bone-smugglers.
These guys are running the industry
and they don't know
a damn thing about rock'n'roll!
OK.
Hello. Police. l'll tell you what, Mr Programme-Director
Man, you put our goddamn tape on the air. lt's gonna get some airplay or my man's gonna gank you here and now!
- Shit, yeah.
- Well, let's not go ganking anyone.
- Um, if we play the tape, will you go?
- That's all we need, d-cheese.
Play the thing, Milo. Do what he says.
Play it! What are you waiting for?
- Sorry about all this. Enjoy.
- l can't wait.
We can't play this tape.
We're only set up for CDs and cassettes.
We should've brought a cassette.
A cassette makes my background vocal sound like someone's stepping on my nuts.
- God. Mr Perfectionist.
- Quit necking. All we got was a quarter-inch.
There's gotta be a reel-to-reel.
Find it. lt's a radio station.
Yeah. That's it there.
Milo, didn't l tell you to knock when you come in?
Just keep quiet and get that reel-to-reel deck down to the booth.
Telling me to shut up now? A brother can't talk without the white man slap him down.
Just do it, Marcus!
Damn.
White man with a gun. Same shit been happenin' to my people for 425-odd years.
Hey, you like working here, man?
We're down, man. Hendrix was God.
You wanna take a step back?
You're standing on my dick, man!
Yeah, l seen that. Anthrax and Public
Enemy, that was outta control, man.
Together, you know. You catch that one, G?
Don't call me G.
- What do you want me to call you?
- Hey, come on.
All right, that's it. l can't wait for you to put that gun down, cos when you do we're gonna throw down.
That's right. We're gonna get serious.
Mano a swine.
Hey, look, just shut your pie hole and keep working.
Pie hole? That supposed to be some Cracker slang?
Come on, let's go.
Agh!
Ooh! Ooh!
You can't smoke here, babe.
Yeah? What am l doin' now?
You should put it out.
The smoke could damage the equipment.
- Are you ready?
- Almost.
OK, give us a real nice intro.
And don't say anything about us having a gun to your head.
- OK, who are you guys?
- My name's Pip.
- The band. The band name.
- Sorry about that.
- He doesn't wear a helmet, does he?
- lt's right there on the box. Read it.
''The Lone Rangers.'' That's original.
- How can you pluralise ''The Lone Ranger''?
- What's wrong with that?
Well, there's three of you.
You're not exactly lone.
Shouldn't you be The Three Rangers? l've no idea what you're saying right now.
- You lost me.
- Forget it, lan. Just play the thing!
Yeah, forget it. Come on, just play it.
Listen up, guppies, lan the Shark is back and have l got a surprise for you. l've got goose bumps, frankly.
For the first time ever, l'm willing to bet, here's that hit single by The Lone Rangers.
- Turn it off! Come on, man.
- What did you do? What you doing?
- Tonto must have loaded the tape in wrong.
- Hey, your machine dilapitatled it, man.
Hey!
Oh, what?! Hey! Oh!
- Hey, that's my jacket!
- Put it out!
Please!
- Oh, man. The demo's wasted.
- What are we gonna do now?
Run! lt's the inbreeding.
Go! Go! Go!
- Man.
- How'd they know we were here? l don't know. l don't know.
OK. Look, maybe they're just on patrol.
All right, we didn't do nothing, right?
- What?
- You go.
You guys suck.
Everything's all right. lt's cool.
Let me in! Let me in! l don't wanna go to jail. l'm fragile.
Go!
Argh!
Shit! We're surrounded.
Why don't we give ourselves up?
We could say we were joking around.
They'll cart us off before you can say ''Rudolph Redpecker''.
- Well, you didn't have to break out the gun.
- They wouldn't play the tape.
- You didn't have to do that!
- Shut up.
- You shut up!
- Both of you shut up! lf we go outside, we get roped.
We stay and figure it out.
Excuse me?
- Oh, jeez.
- More people. OK.
We round everyone up, put 'em in the station and nobody leaves until we figure this out.
What was she on the Clydesdale scale?
Yeah, that's where you gotta figure how many
Clydesdales it'd take to tear her off your face.
Later. Let's go. l knew from looking at him that he was a bomb about to go off.
A big fat media bomb!
They're gonna be all over the news now.
Time magazine, Larry King Live. lf the song's in English, it's a gold record.
Come on, come on, let's go.
Hi again.
Hi.
Hey, hey, you guys think you're gonna waste anybody?
Cos if you are, pop Milo first.
That guy's a bozo de luxe.
Uh-huh? Go.
Perhaps it won't be long until this thing blows over.
Argh!
Argh!
All right, everybody on the floor right now.
Do you mind if l sit in a chair? l don't wanna get all cruddy.
- Uh, yeah.
- Thank you. lf she doesn't sit on the floor, l don't know why l have to.
You heard the man.
Hit the deck or l smoke you.
Sit down on the floor now! Everybody else gets to sit in a chair except for you.
Are we still on the air?
- Have you made contact?
- No. One guy came out, but he went back in.
Have Dispatch give us their number.
Let's call them.
- You getting this, Wilson?
- Establish contact, ensure it's no false alarm. l know the procedure.
- Could l get something to eat, man?
- You hungry, buddy?
Hey, Chazz. Chazz.
What?
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- That guy says he's hungry.
Who gives a shit?! l'm trying to think here, OK?
KPPX, where the action never stops.
Oh, hi.
Well, there's three psychotic musicians with guns. How would you feel? l have no idea.
The leader? Hold on. lt's the police.
They wanna talk to you.
He doesn't wanna talk.
What am l supposed to do, beg him?
What are you doing to get us out of here?
OK, fine.
He wants you to go out and talk to him.
Bag that. What for?
He wants to know your demands for releasing the hostages.
- Oh, my God!
- Demands? What's he mean by ''hostages''? l've got a reality check for you, curly.
What you're doing is a felony, maybe worse.
- What are your demands?
- Nothing. l just don't wanna go outside.
OK. Come here, come here.
- What do we need?
- A hockey stick up the backside of his head. l'm warning you. Don't bring Chazz down!
Thank you, Rex.
All right. Now, what do we want?
Uh, Chazz? l like your hair.
- What's that?
- My name's Suzzi, with two z's.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
So you, like, answer the phones and all that stuff?
Mm-hm. Yeah, for, like, six hours a day.
Oh, what a drag, huh? l understand you're trying to make a statement, but this is getting out of hand.
Hey, come on, you know where l'm coming from. Be a sport, will ya?
All right, but can we move this along?
Now, why did you come here? l came here for a lousy three minutes and 31 seconds of airplay. That's it.
Fine. Now there's cops outside with guns, and you're holding people hostage, right?
- Uh, yeah.
- On top of that, your tape is destroyed.
So, there's only one thing that you can do.
Get the other copy of the demo.
Yeah!
Rex!
Bastard!
You called on the phone,
but we're not at home.
Leave a message for Chazz. We'll call you
back soon, so don't have a spaz!
Come on, come on.
Stay back now! Back there!
Hold it! Hold it! l want you to control this crowd. lf they give you any trouble, cuff 'em and throw 'em in the squad car.
Technically l can't do that, Sergeant.
The Civilian Review... l know what the Civilian Review Committee says, but they're not doing crowd control.
Listen, when you're in the line of fire you do what's necessary to get the job done.
You don't break the law but occasionally you bend it. When that time comes, improvise.
Yes, sir.
Cover me.
Get your hands up over your head.
Get down on the pavement! Get down!
- What the f...
- Sergeant.
What?
You men, back off. Get back, goddammit! Put those guns down! lt's OK. You can get up when...
Goddammit, get back!
What the hell is this?
You invited me to come out!
You surprised us. l'm Sergeant O'Malley. l'm here to work with you.
- What's your name?
- My rhythm section's watching me!
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Everybody OK?
- They're all fine. My name's Chazz.
- Great. lt's good to meet you, Chazz.
Tell me what l can do to get you to end this.
- You gotta find my tape.
- Sure. OK. What kind of tape is it? lt's a demo tape. We wanna play it on the air.
You wanna play this tape on the radio, then you'll come out?
Right. The machine inside ate the original.
My girlfriend's got the only other copy.
- Give me her number. l'll call her.
- l already tried that. She's off for the night.
- You're gonna have to find her.
- Where is she? l don't know. Try the Strip somewhere.
Maybe The Whisky.
She's...
She's totally pissed at me, but... ls that her? She's a real looker.
Yeah.
Why don't black people like me?
- Excuse me?
- lt's just that l listen to a lot of rap music, and l know how angry black people are.
And l feel bad for all you guys gotta put up with.
Well, that's very nice of you.
How about when you go into a store and all the clerks start starin' at you like you're gonna rob the place and you're like ''l just wanna buy something''?
That's never happened.
Does that happen to you?
Ah, no, but l'm just saying that would be bad if it did.
Look at Chazz doing his thing.
Listen, Chazz, this is gonna take some time, OK?
You have to send out one of the hostages just as a sign of good faith. That's my rules.
All right, fine. You have your orders, Chief. Now get cracking. lt's more like power slop, but with an edge.
OK. The cops are going to get Kayla. l cut a deal with them.
We've gotta send one person out.
Please. l'll go.
- A hostage, doof.
- Sorry.
But not me, man. lt's just too cool.
Why don't we let Yvonne go, man?
She's very nice.
Wait a minute. l don't see why you automatically have to choose a woman.
Well, it's kind of sexist, don't you think? l mean, we could draw straws.
- We could...
- OK.
Yvonne, go. You'll be home in time for The Simpsons.
Stay strong, sister.
Congratulations.
Hey, butterball, l think you're exceeding the maximum weight limit for that belt.
Wilson, get over here! l'm sending out a sweep of Sunset Strip for the girlfriend. l want you there to supervise.
Whoa.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Whoa, look, we got fans.
- l didn't know that many people knew us.
Hey, hold this. Thanks.
Hey!
- l'm gonna miss Yvonne.
- Let me tell you something.
Don't chitchat with them.
They're not buddies. They're hostages. l was trying to be nice. l know, but then every time you tell somebody to get on the floor they're gonna be like ''Even me, Pip? l thought we had something going.''
You gotta scare these people.
Practise. Just try it. l just feel a little goofy trying to be a badass with a water pistol.
They don't know that. They think it's real.
Now show me what you got. Come on.
OK. Get over there, please. Thank you.
What are you, a crack baby?
Give me that. l'll show you.
All right.
Hey, you! You shut your mouth, you bastard, or l'll stab your eyeballs out and piss all over your brain! lt's gonna be a slaughterhouse, with bodies flying through the air like dolls on fire!
Oh, my God.
- OK?
- OK, all right. Thank you.
- All right, against the wall.
- Come on, tough, tough!
- Seriously, move it.
- l'm not scared, Pip. Come on.
- l'm gonna stab your heads off.
- With what? With what?
- With my dick!
- Yeah!
Yeah! Blood's gonna come out of your head and there's nothing you can do about it cos l'm a madman!
- That's good.
- lt kinda hurt my throat.
Come on, come on, move, move.
Shit! Here comes the cavalry.
So she boots me out of my own house and now l'm at the motor lodge.
12 years of marriage and devotion down the tubes.
- Hello, O'Malley.
- They called you too soon. lt's solved itself.
Good, cos l'm taking over the interior perimeter. You and your boys can fall back.
Like hell you are. Didn't you hear?
We don't have a situation.
Well, what do you call an office full of hostages?
Mace, l'm in the middle of negotiations, and until l decide there are no options, you don't use force.
Well, OK, O'Malley. lt's your show.
- Hello?
- Hello.
- May l help you, sir?
- Hello.
Please could you put me through to someone on the scene. l don't have much time.
Oh, Christ.
Looks like you got your hands full,
Mr Hostage Negotiator.
Let's go. l want those media people back.
Come on! Move it! Get it back!
- Dispatch has another call from inside.
- Swell.
Listen, you sick sack of swill, if you hurt one single...
- l don't have much time.
- What? Who is this?
Doug Beech. l work at the radio station.
- Speak up, Beech. Are they molesting you?
- No, l'm hiding in the air-cooling system.
They don't know that l'm here. l want you to do something but l can't let you put yourself at risk.
- What?
- You got any kind of training?
- l was in the merchant marines.
- Yeah, l copy that.
- Get them away from the van.
- l was an accountant.
Nah, you won't be held accountable.
Listen, l want you to be my man inside.
This is what l want you to do, Beech. l want you to check in with me periodically. l want you to talk to me directly and me only. l have a number for you.
Check it out. Come on in.
- l'm gonna clip us some Cs, dude.
- Sweet.
We've got these guys by the short curlies.
We could demand free stuff from the cops.
What am l talking about? There's probably cool stuff here. Play track two.
As long as we're here let's hear decentjams.
Oh, yeah! This is the real Rebel Radio.
The voice of the resistance: this is Chazz speaking. Yo!
Shit, man, you guys oughta to have fun.
You can't cuss on the air.
Hey, look at all the stuff we found.
There's $5,000 worth of backstage passes.
- You guys scored.
- Can l bogart one of these?
You've gotta see this. We've got CDs, we've got T-shirts, we've got...
Oh, what have we here?
Those sound like concert tickets to me.
What do you say we take a few calls?
You're on the air.
Ooh, let's turn down your radio, asshole.
l'm sorry. l wanna talk
to the guy with the gun.
l just said you're on the air,
numbnuts. So talk already.
l want some tickets to that show with
Penelope Lovestocking and Crimson Shroud.
Oh, man, you actually listen to that Seattle bullshit?
- Shroud rips, dude.
- All right, bro, no problem.
You gotta come down because we've got free tickets to give away, but we are completely surrounded by cops.
We need some feedback here. Go.
- You're on the air.
- Whoa, am l on the air?
- Come on, Butt-head, give me the phone.
- Am l speaking English, dipshit?
- Come on, Butt-head! No way.
- Shut up, Beavis.
- So what do you guys want?
- You guys are, like, The Lone Rangers, right?
- Yeah.
- We saw you at The Wheel Well last month.
- You suck.
- Come down here and say that, you punks!
- Yeah, you can kiss my ass.
- Why don't you make the chicks get naked?
Usual crop of retards.
Hey, guys, you're on TV.
A band of failed musicians lashing out
at the society that won't listen to them.
Their target, the only capitalist edifice
their MTV-soaked minds recognise:
- a rock'n'roll radio station.
- Oh, man. This is complete bullshit.
..and l quote: ''White urban males
are the least likely to elicit tears
from a city already beleaguered
by people with real problems.''
- The mayor is on holiday...
- l'd like to croak that bitch.
Mace, we have contact with the man inside.
- Beech, is that you?
- They've got six hostages.
- lt's three weirdos with Uzis.
- Outstanding, Beech.
You just keep your eyes open and your tail down.
Have you got any personnel at home
you want me to call, like a wife?
No, no, l don't even have a home. l've got a condo.
Listen, l guess l've just tried to wait to meet the right woman. l guess l should have waited longer myself.
Let me tell you about the shrew l married.
l used to come home tired every night,
sometimes five or six in the morning.
l dropped my underwear
on the floor one time, had a teeny-weeny little skid mark in it.
You'd have thought l started World War Nine.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
You've really great arms.
You should show them off.
How does he do that?
Pip? He gets his hands on more bumper than a body shop.
With that ''l seem so stupid l must be cute'' routine?
That's the quiet cool.
Chicks, man, they just flock on it.
Man, you got hot CDs here and l never hear them. Why don't you ever play these guys?
That's Milo's call. Why don't we play 'em? lf they're so hot, how come they're not tearing up the charts, babe?
Cos you never play 'em, babe. You suck.
- What do you think, lan?
- To tell you the truth, l stick to the classics.
Rock'n'roll's been all downhill since Lennon died.
My whole life, people have been cramming this classic-rock crap down my throat.
Think l give a shit about the Beatles?
No offence, but today's music doesn't have a whole lot to say. ls that right? So you're gonna tell me that ''Purple Haze'' says something?
Hey, lan, man, wait till you hear our stuff. We kick ass.
Swell. Yeah, l can't wait to hear your brilliant song.
Beats the shit out of the fruity music you listen to, tough guy.
He's got himself a whole crate of
Kenny G CDs and you're talking trash?
A crate of CDs?
He's got a stockpile of easy-listening shit-shingles in his office.
You don't even listen to music. What are you doing with a whole crate of CDs?
Those are free promos. l use 'em as stocking stuffers. lt's the middle of July!
Aloha out there in radio land.
This is Oedipus Rex on WKPP-Rex, comin' at ya, smooth-talking DJ terrorist.
These guys rule.
You're gonna hear some new shit.
There's a box of that crap right there.
Yeah, dude.
Blonde, wearing something tight and black.
Great. Grand. Wonderful.
Come on, fellas. Let's put a sock in it, OK?
What the hell are these?
They're shorts, lan.
You know, pants with little legs?
And this?
Hey, l don't have to explain myself to you, man.
- Come here.
- What? l'm right here.
Speak to me. What's goin' down?
OK, um...
We're changing formats.
Sunday at midnight the station goes soft rock.
- Rebel Radio's goin' soft?
- We're changing our name to The Rain.
You know, ''Relax to the mellow sounds of The Rain on KPPX.''
That, and we're being forced to re-staff.
- You pud!
- All those blow jobs for nothing.
You're firing me, you little snake-in-the-grass bastard?
Where do you get the balls to fire me?
This was handed down from above, lan! l fought this kicking and screaming!
You've just begun to kick and scream, you snivelling putz. l'll kill you!
- Agh!
- A fight!
- Yeah!
- Ooh! Ow, my spine!
You're Kayla! l need to talk to you about Chazz Darby. lf Chazz needs any bail money, you can just tell him to forget it.
Look, there's a situation down at Rebel Radio. l'm gonna need to take you in.
Look, Chazz says you've got a tape.
Please!
Hey, check out Barney Fife.
Don't you think you're out of your league, chunk-style?
Look, l don't wanna have to bring you boys in on a 148.
That's obstruction.
Now what are you gonna do about that? lmprovise.
So she says to me ''He was only cleaning the pool filter, Sniggles.''
And l'm thinking to myself ''lt's 7pm, he's
in dungarees and his equipment is bone-dry.''
Pool filter, my ass!
Thing is, she could have left me for a plastic surgeon, but a lousy pool cleaner?!
Kayla, if you're listening,
l really need that demo tape.
You gotta get it to the station.
Dammit.
Shoo, dog. Oh, shoo!
Ugh.
Now stay.
Uh, 67 copies of Moby-Dick.
- The movie or the book?
- They made a book out of that?
- Yeah, l think so.
- Yeah, get the book.
- What are you guys doing?
- We're taking the cops up on those demands.
- We've got a killer list.
- Yeah. We ask for airplay and whatever else...
..then we demand a bunch of weird stuff so we can plead insanity later.
- Where did this come from?
- Pip's idea.
Way to go, Pip.
You guys are crazy, man.
You're all whoo-hoo and shit.
- So, what else we got so far?
- Number one: airplay, underlined twice.
Number two: a helmet filled with cottage cheese.
Number three: a Zon walnut bass with a graphite neck.
- Thank you.
- Hey! What about me?
- Go for broke. lt's on the LAPD.
- Oh.
- l want a PRS Guitar with the dragon inlay.
- Nice. l'm coming, you bastard.
Number 13: naked pictures of Bea Arthur.
- Excuse me?
- The chick from The Golden Girls.
Look, l know who she is. l'm just a street cop.
How am l supposed to find all this stuff?
A giant baby bottle? Give me a break.
You better figure it out, or it's curtains for everyone.
Oh yeah, and we want a record contract, so let's get some record executive here pronto.
- What?
- Why'd you ask for a record contract?
- That's what we want.
- You don't demand one from the cops. lt's gotta come unsolicited.
- What's unsolicited?
- Forget it. Just forget it.
What did l do? l'm just yankin' the guy. lt's one thing to goof around but we do have a serious agenda here. Are you with that?
- Yeah, l'm with that.
- Good.
Moody.
Pip?
What are you thinking about?
Swimming pools.
- Swimming pools, huh?
- Yeah. l wish l was in one right now.
The water's all clear and cool, and you spin around in there like an egg.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Mm-mm.
No? lt's kind of weird us meeting like this, huh? l don't know.
- We got that background check in.
- Yeah, let me see this.
''Chazz Darby, born Jerkwater, lowa.
Real name: Chester Ogilvie.''
DMV says his occupation is master of ceremonies.
- Arrests?
- Just two tickets for helmet violation.
Just another small-town punk comin' out west to be a star.
- Anything else?
- Yeah. The local PD just faxed us his picture.
Chester. l'm giving you the same rate as everybody else. l know it's steep, but think how many people will listen.
This is primo advertising.
Yo, scumbag, are you selling ads on our airtime?
Hold on a second, Brad.
D'you mind? l've got a station to run here.
Yeah, l'm back. lf the cops kill him before the spot runs, you'll get a complete refund.
Oh! Uh, Brad.
You just hung up on an important man.
Agh!
Oh.
Help.
D'you find anything in that van? Drugs?
Nah, just some toys and a bunch of pool-cleaning gear.
Pool-cleaning gear?
Give me that damn phone.
What? A gun!
Affirmative. These cowboys are more dangerous than l thought.
Work your way up the vent ducts to the roof.
Two of my men will meet you there.
- Yeah, but a gun?
- Mace out.
Can l ask you something?
What's with you guys and these tattoos?
Check it out. l got this barbed wire here.
A gecko. And this one is so cool. lt's, uh, the Grim Reaper. See? l'm gonna get some more cash and probably colour it in or put some chaps on it.
You know, l can understand ''Mom'' or ''l Heart Wanda'', but why the Reaper?
Well, it's like death is stalking me and it's telling me l better get off my ass and get this band rolling.
This is for real. l gotta cut a record. l figure l'm screwed up enough that l could write a song that'll live on for ever and then after that it don't matter.
You know?
OK, kiddies, listen up because
this is lan the Shark's final night at KPPX.
Special unscheduled announcement: effective Monday, this station goes
easy listening.
We're having a big farewell party tonight, so come on down!
As part of our final hurrah we have a special segment:
''Getting To Know Your Armed Assailant.''
Now we have Chazz Darby here.
Now, Chazz, you say all you wanna do is be heard.
Well, you've got the whole world listening.
What have you got to say?
Well, l guess all we have to say is that we wanna be heard.
Yeah, well, we've kind of established that. What else?
Hey, man, you can't be putting me on the spot.
You want him to make a speech?
Who does he look like, Sting?
OK, you've sold out the Forum, you're standing in front of 20,000 screaming fans.
- What are you gonna say to 'em?
- l'm gonna say rock'n'roll!
Warp speed, Mr Sulu!
Yeah.
That's it? You'll scream ''Rock'n'roll''?
You're gonna go to jail for that?
There's a saying, Milo:
''lf it's too loud, you're too old.''
- Where are you goin'?
- You mind if l take a pee, man?
Good luck.
Don't forget to shake.
Milo.
What are you doing, you little buttnut?
Milo, Milo, Milo.
Milo!
- Open the door, Milo.
- Quiet. l said open the door, Milo.
- What was that?
- l don't know.
- Don't yell at me, Milo.
- You're screwing on a $1,400 leather couch!
You're so rude! You don'tjust burst in here without knocking.
- lf there is one stain on that couch...
- You'll what?
Fire me? Well, guess what? l quit!
Oh, don't. l don't want you to lose yourjob over this. Milo, this was my bust.
- A screamfest... Oh, Pip.
- Get your filthy shoes off my furniture!
- Suzzi, you can leave right now.
- No, l can't, because l'm a hostage and Pip is my...
Pip is my man with a gun.
- And he says l get to stay. Right, Pip?
- Sorry, dude.
Pip, put the monster away.
Oh, now what?
- All right, everybody back to the booth.
- Argh!
Oh, please, no. Don't do this. l can't take it, man. My aunt was buried alive!
- Give it a rest.
- Not in the closet!
- What are they doing?
- Messin' with our heads.
Chazz! Chazz. Guys.
- Hey, Chazz, let me in.
- Keep an eye on him, Pip.
Chazz. Hey, guys. Chazz, let me in.
- Who are you?
- Chris Moore, Capitol Records. Let me in.
- l told you, man. Things are going our way.
- Take a few steps back from the door!
And toss me some lD.
- OK, here.
- How'd you find us?
The cops told me you're looking for a record contract. We've gotta take advantage of this.
- Yeah, what's that?
- Will you look? This is hot.
- You're the hottest thing since Marky Mark.
- Marky Mark! That guy sucks.
OK, forget him.
There's magic here. Let's talk contracts. l promise you, someday we're gonna be backstage at the Forum laughing about this.
All right, what side did you take in the big David Lee Roth-Van Halen split?
- What?
- What a question.
- What side did you take? Halen or Roth?
- Van Halen.
- He's a cop.
- Later, bacon.
Strictly ajudgment call. They sold a lot of records after David left. One more question.
Right, right, right. Who'd win in a wrestling match, Lemmy or God?
- Lemmy.
- Ah!
- God.
- Wrong. Trick question. Lemmy is God.
- Oh, come on.
- Get the hell out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!
What the hell is this, O'Malley?
Now you bring in a cop to try to kill me? ls that it? l'm not going nowhere, pal!
- You put the power back on.
- You're stirring the crowd up. l got free concert tickets here!
For me and you and you...
What the hell is going on? Get those people outta here! Get 'em outta here! l love a parade!
Hey, man, check out all that poony! We could parley this into a hummer! They love us!
Yeah, they love us.
- You put the power back on!
- No, l won't, Chazz. l'm drawin' the line there!
- Yo, is everyone havin' a good time tonight?
- Yeah!
Wanna see the cops shut this party down?
So they got the cards. We got the numbers!
Rodney King! Rodney King!
Rodney King. Rodney King.
Holy shit!
Rodney King?
What's that supposed to mean?
He's that guy.
Rodney King!
All right, dammit!
Turn the goddamn power back on!
Chazz! Chazz!
Kayla! l tried to call you. l'm sorry, it was my fault.
No, l was being a bitch.
Why don't you give it up, Chester?
You can talk it over later.
- Stay out of this and get your hands off her!
- Why did he call you that?
- Uh...
- There's a lot Chester didn't tell you about.
- What's he talking about, Chazz?
- lt's, uh... He's, uh...
Ah, shi... You, man...
Kayla, there's something l gotta tell you.
What? l was a geek in school. l had really short hair. l played Dungeons and Dragons. l had a bug collection. l ate my boogers.
My name's not Chazz. lt's Chester.
And l understand if you don't love me any more. l play D&D, too! l was editor of the school magazine.
Yeah! l used to wear corduroy pants. l used to masturbate constantly.
- We're with you, Chazz.
- l want your body!
Hey, Chazz! Chazz!
Whoo!
OK, this is my girlfriend Kayla.
She brought the tape.
- About time.
- What's happening?
We're going on the air, Pip.
We're going live!
Oh, whoa. What happened to this? lt fell off the nightstand.
What did you do to my tape?
Can we even play this?
Maybe if l clean it up and re-spool it. Christ!
- l came all the way down here just to bring it!
- And you took real good care of it, Yoko!
OK, everybody, shut up!
Chazz, l have been with you almost as long as these two assholes! l think it's about time they treated me with a little respect!
This thing smells like piss, man.
Kayla, l don't have time for this noise. Did you come to bitch at Rex or to help us out?
Cos you're being a complete... l can't believe this, after all l've done for you!
And then you chew me out in front of your friends!
- You're acting like a spaz!
- Well, what about you?
You go and pull this moron stunt. lf you would just think for one second instead of trying to be little glory boy.
- ls that so, huh?
- Yeah, that's so, Chester.
You're outta here.
- What?
- Get outta here! Get lost, all right? l got a million things to think about, l don't need you, too. l'm a part of this. You wrote that song for me. That's my song! l wrote that song before l even met you.
You'd better go about your business.
Go about your business.
Nobody look at me!
- My Christ! What are you doing?
- You don't even care.
You don't even care what happens to me!
What have l got? My guitar, my bike and my woman. That's all l got in the world.
And you keep kicking me out! lt's making me insane! l figure if l get a record contract, l can make it up to you. l'm doing this for you! l suppose now you're gonna say you love me.
Come on! l'm holding a gun to a guy's head just so the whole world can hear your song. ls that love or what?
Tell me.
- What do you want from me?
- Tell me.
All right.
- l love you.
- Oh, my God.
What else can l say?
Oh, God!
Oh! Dammit!
Well, that fried out most of the board.
- Great.
- Shit!
Goddamn.
Hey, guys, bring in the stuff.
Yeah! l can't believe they actually found all this crap. l don't know. Maybe we didn't make the demands weird enough, huh?
Man, these are my people.
Hey, hey, we're partyin' in here. Whoo!
We got all kinds of beer.
Am l rockin' or what?
Shit.
Die, dog! lt's a plastic gun!
Oh, my eyes! lt's a plastic gun!
A plastic gun?!
Did you hear that? lt's a plastic gun. We're moving in.
Everybody get back to the booth!
Hold it!
Don't anybody move!
Now back up against the wall and put your hands above your heads.
- lt's a real gun!
- Fall back behind the barriers.
God help us all! lt's all right, Chazz.
Stay calm. We're pulling back.
Body count! Body count!
Everybody get back to the booth!
Get back! Hurry up!
- Move it, move it, move it.
- Cockroach.
Argh!
- Hello.
- Yes, hello. Put the pig on!
- Chazz, is everybody OK?
- What the hell was that bullshit?
- l'm gonna grease somebody in here, l swear!
- Chazz, don't do anything crazy.
- What was all that firing?
- You tell me. You've got guys in the ceiling!
Calm down. We don't have anybody trying to break in. l wouldn't do that.
OK, if this bullshit happens again, l'm gonna start blasting!
You have my word.
How long before you play your tape?
Uh, how long?
Uh, we're workin' on it. l don't know, pretty soon. l'll have a record executive for you here soon.
Now, you know my rules. How about sending out another hostage just as a sign...
- That guy in the ceiling, what was that?
- He says he doesn't know.
- Man, back there, that was huge. Thanks.
- Rock'n'roll.
Whoo. OK, who's got a Tic Tac?
Hello there, boys.
Hi, Chazz. Jimmie Wing. Remember me? l wanted to get in touch with you, but you didn't leave me your phone number.
Yeah. Well, l figured you'd come around.
This is the chimp from Palatine? l told you, man. We scored.
- Hi there. Jimmie Wing.
- Hi. How are you?
Bea Arthur. Outstanding.
Can you believe it? A record exec came all the way down here to meet you guys.
- You have to be careful.
- Jimmie!
Entertainment executives make their living screwing people.
- Got a proposition for you.
- Oh, shit. l know you think l'm a dick...cheese...burger, or whatever, but you need a negotiator. l will offer my services for 10% of the pretax gross. That's standard.
Shine on that, Chazz. lt ain't worth it.
Think about it.
These things can be very tricky.
He's right. My ex-boyfriend Parker was a model, and one time they stole his shoes.
- He hasn't even heard the demo yet.
- Well, if he likes it, l'd like to help.
What do you think, lan?
No, he's right. But make that 5%, Milo, you scum-sucking weasel.
OK, done.
- Untie me.
- You're doing so good, babe.
Now what?
Hey, Rex. Rex, it's me. Rex!
- That surfer guy wants to come back inside.
- What? Will you tell that guy to piss off?
Guys! Guys!
- Hey, no dice, man. Get outta here.
- Oh, come on, Rex.
- l won't try anything.
- You shouldn't have escaped then.
Come on, bro. l was havin' a blast!
Come on, Rex. Rex! l wanna get a drum set that goes underwater so in the middle of our show they can dunk me in a tank and l can do my solo.
Cool! l'm gonna get a leatherjumpsuit with the crotch cut out.
Rex, can you set up the sound system so Jimmie Wing can hear the tape?
- l'm just... l gotta...
- Yeah, go ahead.
Hey, Rex, man. We're gonna go to jail, huh?
Small price to pay to be a legend.
Remember when Ozzy pissed on the Alamo and was banned from San Antonio for a decade?
Did his time, went back, rocked the place.
Section G, the force majeure, where it says
''riots, disturbance, war, acts of God'', etc.
- What about it?
- Amend that to exclude this hostage crisis.
That can be construed as an act of public enemy.
- Done.
- Where's the tape deck?
Oh, why? We need that, too?
- Let me see your arm.
- Why?
Get it, retard.
- The board's fried. l can't fix it.
- Oh!
- No, lan. Come on, man, you gotta help me.
- There's nothing more that l can do.
- This is it, babe.
- All set, Chazz.
- Here we go, my man.
- This is so exciting!
- Oh, my God. Here it is.
- All right.
- Record contract?
- Uh-huh.
We got a record contract!
Everything's square. Just autograph it on the last page and you got yourself a deal.
Hah! We got a contract!
We got a contract!
We made it, babe. We made it.
- Stop!
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
Hey, bro, we got signed.
- Are you crapping me?
- Didn't you play the song for him?
No. We didn't hook this thing up yet.
- So you two haven't heard the demo?
- l heard it on the radio earlier.
You heard it for about five seconds and then it got ate.
Well, Chazz, my man, it's notjust the music, it's the way you talk about it. You have such passion.
- Whoa, whoa. What am l hearing?
- What's wrong, man?
No deal. No.
What are you talking about?
No deal! Yesterday he kicks me out of Palatine Records and today he has a record contract for me to sign. He hasn't even heard my tape. No deal!
- But this is what you wanted!
- Wanna know what l think of your contract?
Allow me to demonstrate.
He wipes his ass with his record contract.
- l love this guy.
- But we still have a deal, right? l wanna be a rock star someday but on my own terms.
Well, l got some news for you, big guy.
You already are a star.
You can't buy this kind of media exposure.
We are sitting on a gold mine here. l am offering a long-term contract to get your music out to millions, plus a whole lot more.
Like what ''a whole lot more''?
Ever since you signed this contract you've been under the umbrella of Palatine Records.
We have an army of attorneys looking out for all our investments.
Chazz, rock stars don't go to jail. Christ.
Vince Neil only got 30 days and he killed somebody.
Hey, buddy, you swear you can get us off? l swear, if you guys play ball.
That's what l'm here for.
Chazz, let's just play the tape on air.
They'll throw deals at us.
Can't do that, man. Console's busted. lt's this or nothing.
OK. Super-duper.
We're making records.
- What about the song? How we gonna play...
- Ah. l'm already ahead of you.
Officer O'Malley. Jimmie Wing.
What are you doing sending me in with these animals? They're out of control.
Yes. Yes.
They have some more demands.
We're gonna soon witness the culmination of this extraordinary rock'n'roll drama: a live performance by The Lone Rangers.
Wait a minute. That can't be right.
You can't pluralise ''Lone Ranger''.
Get the guy who did the Guns N' Roses video.
- Try for John Landis.
- Landis is huge.
This is great.
This is a major media event. We have lights, crowds... We are gonna bury Lollapalooza!
- l said no!
- Look at the boots they gave me. Excuse me.
- How is this? l feel kinda goofy.
- You look like an idiot.
Remember, this only works if you still have the hostages. OK, Kayla? Guns up.
Hey, what about me?
Oh, yeah! l love you, Chazz!
This is a soggy dream come true!
This is rockin'. Yeah!
- All right!
- Whoo!
Let's give it to 'em.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, man.
- What?! lt's not turned on.
- They ain't givin' us no juice.
The amps are props. We'll play your tape through the PA system and you pantomime.
- What, are you yankin' me?
- lf you don't do it this way, we won't be able to sync it up in post.
OK, Rex, lift up the gun so they can see it.
- l ain't lip-syncing, man.
- lt's a video. People always lip-sync.
- Oh, come on, this is bullshit.
- That's all we are to you, some freak show?
For all you care our album could be Pip farting on a snare drum.
- Guys!
- l ain't fartin' on no snare drum. lf you guys don't do it, we don't have a deal.
Me, and the lawyers from Palatine Records, we walk. Now do you get that?
All right. Come here.
Come here. We can't do that.
Don't make us be lame.
OK. Roll tape.
Listen, dirthead, shut your mouth and do what you're told.
What are you doing? We're filming.
Play, you little maggot.
Jimmie, get out of there.
You're ruining my shot.
Listen, l own you! l own you!
Oh, yeah! You can't see nothin' from back there, you filthy scumbags!
Come on down!
Come on! Let's go!
Holy shit!
- Back it up!
- Just get outta the way. Let 'em go. lt's total anarchy!
- Whoo!
- Check it out, man. They dig our song.
All right! Rock'n'roll!

Come on, Anne.
Get in.
Are you able to talk?
During the...
Were you conscious?
I'm sorry to have to inform you...
Do you know?
Your husband died in the accident.
No, but you weren't conscious all that time.
Anne?
Yes, your daughter too.
Is someone there? Who did it?
Mr. Leroy?
Please call the guards.
Somebody broke a window on the first floor.
Come straight away.
I'll look in the garden.
I can't do that.
I broke the window.
- Don't worry.
- I'm sorry.
We'll replace it.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
Is it today?
This afternoon. At 17.00.
Can I do anything for you?
Goodbye.
We gathered to pay respects...
to the memory of the man...
and composer, known as one of...
the most outstanding in the world.
Nobody...
can accept...
that he is gone.
We also mourn his 5 year-old daughter...
Who died by his side.
Patrice...
millions of men...
and women awaited the music you composed...
for the Unification of Europe,
which we all hope to celebrate soon.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- I know you don't want to see me.
- Right.
- Can I come in?
- No.
Julie, I don't want an interview.
What then?
I'm writing an article about your husband.
- I need to know something.
- About what?
The concert for the Unification of Europe.
It doesn't exist.
You've changed.
- You were not so rude before.
- Haven't you heard?
I lost my daughter and husband in an accident.
Is it true you wrote your husband's music?
- Good morning.
- Hello.
Hello.
Bernard!
Good morning madam.
- Did you do what I asked?
- Yes.
- Did you clear the blue room?
- Everything.
Madam, we're all deeply sorry.
Marie?
Marie?
Why are you crying?
Because you're not.
I keep thinking about them.
I remember everything.
How can I forget?
Good morning, please come in.
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thanks.
Let's sit down.
This could take a while.
I'll be right back.
Nobody must know about it.
Ever.
You will pay for my mother's rest home for the rest of her life.
You will take care of
Marie and the gardener.
You will sell all our property... and pay all the money in one account.
- Yes.
May I ask why?
No.
Would you excuse me.
- But what will you have left?
- My own account.
I haven't started yet.
- I put it aside...
- The day I left?
Yes.
Here it is. I was waiting to hear from you.
You were right.
A lot of corrections.
No more than usual.
It's beautiful.
I love this chorus.
Yes.
- Hello?
- It's Julie.
Do you love me?
- Yes.
- Since when
Since I started working with
Patrice.
Do you think of me? Do you miss me?
Yes.
Come if you want to.
- Now?
- Yes, now. Right away.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Olivier?
- I fell.
- Please take it off.
The rest too.
They took everything.
Only the matress is left.
I appreciate what you did for me.
But you see I'm like others.
I sweat, cough, I have cavities...
You won't miss me....
You understand that now.
Shut the door when you leave.
Julie!
Julie!
I don't want any children in the building.
Let me ask you something.
It may help.
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
I mean, for a living?
Nothing.
- Absolutely nothing?
- Absolutely nothing.
I have what you are looking for.
But the apartment needs repairing.
It may take a while.
Can I live there now?
Sure. It needs a quick paint.
Can I see it now?
Yes. What is your name?
Julie de Courcy, with a "Y".
Sorry, Julie Vignon. I am going back to my maiden name.
- Coffee and ice cream?
- As usual.
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?
I'm sorry for the noise.
I've almost finished.
I haven't heard anything.
Can I come in?
I heard you got locked out last week.
Your husband lent me a blanket.
I spent the night in the stairwell.
I wanted you to sign this.
- What is it?
- Everyone has signed already.
We don't want loose women in our building.
The young woman downstairs...
I don't want to get involved.
She is a whore.
I don't care.
You are in perfect health.
Everything is fine.
You are in good spirits.
- Yes?
- Hello, it's Antoine.
It is for you.
Hello?
My name is Antoine.
- You don't know me...
- No I don't. Excuse me.
Who is it?
Some boy.
He has been looking for you.
- I said he could call.
- It's alright.
- Hello?
- Let's meet.
- It's important.
- Nothing is important.
- It is about an object.
- What?
A necklace with a cross.
I'd forgotten about it.
I found it near the car.
I couldn't keep it.
That's stealing.
If you want to ask me something,
I got there just after...
No.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to return the necklace...
I wanted to ask you something too.
Yes?
When I opened the door... your husband was still alive.
He said...
I don't understand.
He said "Now try coughing."
He was telling us a joke.
It's about a woman who can't stop coughing. She sees a doctor.
He examined her and gave her a pill.
She swallowed it.
And asked "What was it?"
"The most powerful laxative known to medicine".
"A laxative for a cough?"
"Yes. Try coughing now."
It made us laugh.
Then the car crashed.
My husband always liked to repeat the punch line.
You returned it.
It is yours.
Are you sick?
Are you okay?
You always gotta hold onto something.
What did you say?
- Thank you.
- For what?
I'm staying.
In order to throw me out, they had to collect signatures from all the tenants.
Your place is nice.
When I was a little girl,
I had a lamp like this.
I'd stand under it and stretch out my hand.
I wanted to jump and touch it.
I forgot all about it.
Where did you find it?
I found it.
Souvenir?
Do you live here alone?
Yes.
I could never spend a night alone.
Something must have happened.
You are not the type someone dumps.
Forgive me, I talk too much.
Poor guy.
Who?
He was asleep there last night.
He's gone now but left the flute.
Julie?
A coffee.
I searched everywhere.
- And?
- And I found you.
- Nobody knows where I live.
- Nobody.
It took a few months.
Then I got lucky.
My cleaning lady's daughter saw you in the area.
I've come here ever since.
- Do you spy on me?
- No.
I miss you.
Did you run away?
From me?
Do you hear what he is playing?
- It sounds like...
- Yes.
I've seen you.
Maybe that will do for now.
I'll try.
How do you know this music?
I invent lots of things. I like to play.
Just a second.
- A problem with your place?
- No. I'd like another one like this.
I can manage that but it will take time.
- How long?
- 2 or 3 months.
You cut yourself.
My cat scratched me.
Mum?
Marie-France.
It's me...
Julie.
Julie.
Come to me.
I've heard you are dead.
You seem fine.
Young, very young.
You were always younger, you look 30 now.
- When we were young...
- I'm not your sister, but your daughter.
I'm 33.
I know.
I was kidding.
I have everything here.
The TV...
I see the entire world.
- Do you watch too?
- No.
Tell me about your house, husband... children...
- Or about you?
Mum...
My husband and daughter are dead.
I have no home anymore.
I heard about it.
I was happy before.
I loved them and they loved me.
Mum, are you listening to me?
I'm listening to you, Marie-France.
Now I have only one thing left to do:
Nothing.
I don't want friends, belongings, love any more.
Those are all traps.
Do you have money, my child?
To get by?
- Yes I have enough.
- That's important.
You can't give up everything.
- Mum?
- Yes?
Was I afraid of mice when I was young?
You weren't.
Julie was afraid.
I'm afraid now.
Thank you.
Nice to see you. Come in.
Can I ask you something?
My wife is out. Please come in.
Can you lend me your cat?
Excuse me?
Your cat. I need a cat for a few days.
He's not castrated.
He can be aggressive.
Here.
I am not sure he likes you.
What are you doing here?
I saw you from the bus.
You were running like crazy.
Are you crying?
No, it's water.
- You don't wear underwear?
- Never.
I borrowed the cat from the neighbour, to kill the mice.
It had babies.
It's normal, Julie.
Are you afraid to go back?
I'll go clean up.
I'll see you at my place.
It's Lucille. Julie, I have a favour to ask of you.
Take a taxi here.
I will pay you back.
- Now? It is late.
- It's 11:30pm. You have 25 minutes.
It's important.
- I can't.
- I beg you.
I never asked you for anything. Please come.
- Where?
- 3 Cita de Midi. Near Pigalle.
First door on the left.
There's a buzzer.
Say it's for me. You'll come?
- Yes?
- I've come to see Lucille.
Sorry
You came.
Yes.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
- Are you angry?
- No.
We are on in 5 minutes.
Get me ready.
After I changed,
I came here for a drink.
I looked around at the audience, for no reason.
In the middle...
...of the first row,
I saw my father.
He seemed tired.
And sleepy.
But he was starring a girl's ass.
The shithead who let you in wouldn't make him leave.
He told me if he pays, he has a right to watch.
I didn't know who I could count on.
I was desperate.
I didn't know who to talk to.
- That's why I phoned you.
- And your father?
10 minutes ago, he looked at his watch and left.
The last train to Montpellier is at 11:45pm.
Lucille, why do you do this?
Because I like to.
I think everybody likes to.
- You saved my life.
- I didn't do anything.
I asked you to come and you did.
No.
Julie...
Isn't that you?
Lucille, we are on.
It's me.
The European Council proposes that you...
finish the composition of
Patrice De Courcy.
I agreed. I am working on it now.
I'm trying to understand Patrice.
It's easy.
I don't know.
Can you tell me something...
about this score, shown here for the very first time?
It's the first part of the concert Patrice composed,
commissioned by the European Council.
The concert was to be played just once
by twelve symphonic orchestras...
in the 12 EU cities.
Patrice was a secretive man.
The only person who could understand him.
was his wife, Julie.
I tried asking her...
to participate in this program...
but she refused.
I assume that these documents are from your archives.
No, they are not archives.
Who can predict...?
They are photos and documents which
I found in his desk at the conservatory.
His wife didn't want them.
I am not sure if
I should show them.
He was a great man. One of the most important composers of our time.
That's true
People like him belong to everybody.
I'll be five minutes.
Where did I put it?
A green calling card.
Did you watch TV today?
No.
I found it.
Her number at home and at work.
Why do you need this?
Today, on TV... she showed the scores I took from you.
Yes.
After the accident, when nothing was sure, I made a copy.
When you picked it up,
I knew you'd destroy it.
I kept the copy and sent it to Strasbourg.
Why did you do that?
The music is so beautiful.
You can't destroy things like that.
Olivier!
Olivier!
Olivier!
Olivier!
Olivier!
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
I heard you're finishing Patrice's concert.
I thought I could try...
You can't. You have no right.
It won't be the same.
Do you understand?
I said I'd try.
I don't know if I'll finish.
I'll tell you why. It was a way... that's what I thought... to make you cry, to make you run.
The only way of making you say,
"I want" or "I don't want".
I...
You can't...
It's not fair.
You didn't leave me any choice.
You have no right to.
You want to see what I've done?
I'm not sure I understood.
If I could play for you...
Do you know what the chorus sings?
- No.
- I thought Patrice had told you.
- No.
- In Greek, the rhythm is different.
Who was that girl?
What girl?
In the photos on the program.
She was with Patrice.
Didn't you know?
Just tell me, were they together?
Yes.
Since when?
Several years.
Where does she live?
Near Montparnasse.
They often met at the courts.
She is a lawyer.
Or she works for one.
What do you want to do?
Meet her.
- It's the third time it happened to him.
- It's systematic.
It can't be... it's unbelievable!
But it's not important
What's important is that...
Excuse me.
What about equality?
Is it because I don't speak French... that the court won't hear my case?
- Excuse me...
- Yes?
Yes?
- You were my husband's mistress?
- Yes.
I didn't know. I just found out.
It's a shame.
Now you'll hate him, and me too.
I don't know...
Of course you will.
It is his child?
Yes.
But he didn't know.
I found out...
I found out after the accident.
I didn't want a child but it happened.
Now I want to keep it.
Do you have a cigarette?
You shouldn't.
Do you want to know when and where?
- How many times a month?
- No.
You want to know if he loved me?
Yes, that was my question.
Why ask, I know he loved you.
Yes. He loved me.
Julie...
Will you hate me now?
Come in.
What happened?
You met her?
Once you asked me to take Patrice's papers.
- You didn't want to.
- No, but if I had...
- The photos were among them?
- Yes.
If I had taken them,
I'd have known.
And if I had burned them,
I'd never have known.
That's right.
Maybe it's better this way.
Can you show me what you've composed?
- These are violins?
- The altos.
And now...
Wait a second. Lighter, without the percussions.
Let's remove the trumpets.
Piano. Piano.
Sul tasto.
- Instead of a piano...
- A Flute?
Flute... Start back here.
That's as far as I got.
- And the finale?
- I don't know.
There was a paper.
The counterpoint was supposed to come back.
He told me, it is memento.
Try weaving it back in.
- Van den Budenmayer?
- Yes
He wanted to allude to him at the end. You know how much he loved him.
Are you still in touch with our lawyer?
- Sometimes.
- Did he sell the house yet?
I don't know.
I doubt it. He'd have called.
- Tell him not to.
- Okay.
If you can handle all this, will you show me?
I'll show you.
- There was a mattress inside.
- Yes?
But it's not there any more.
Mr Olivier bought it.
- I didn't think you would need it.
- That's fine.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Have you been here before?
- No, never.
Upstairs are the bedrooms and the office.
I'll show you them later.
This is the kitchen.
It's always been like this.
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Boy.
Have you chosen a name?
Yes.
I thought... he should have his name and his house.
Here.
- Do you still need me?
- No, you can go home. Thank you.
- I knew it.
- What?
Patrice told me a lot about you.
Really?
Like what?
That you are good.
That you are good, and generous.
That's what you want to be.
People can always count on you.
Even me.
I'm sorry.
- Yes?
- It's me. I finished.
Come pick it up tomorrow.
Or now, if you're not too tired.
I'm not tired. But I will not come for the score.
What?
I won't pick it up.
I've been thinking it for a week.
This music can be mine.
A little heavy and awkward...
but mine.
Or yours, but everyone would have to know.
Are you there?
Yes.
You're right.
- Hello?
- It's me again.
I wanted to ask you...
You really sleep on the mattress?
Yes.
- You never told me.
- No I didn't.
Do you still love me?
I love you.
- Are you alone?
- Of course I'm alone.
- I'm coming.
# If I can talk like an angel,
# And I have no love,
# I will be a copper ringing.
# If I can prophesy
# And if I have no love
# I will be nothing.
# Love is patient.
# Love is kind.
# It bears all things.
# And knows everything.
# Love never ends.
# Prophecy - gone.
# If languages - silent.
# Knowledge - nothing.
# Prophecy - gone.
# Languages - silent.
# And only stays
# Faith, hope and love
# But the biggest one from this three
# is love.
{692}{757}I know the tour's over,|but it's--
{759}{866}Last week in Spain, I really felt like|I was gonna have a nervous breakdown.
{868}{952}I couldn't take the crowds,|do the shows. It was too hot.
{953}{1019}Everything was getting to me.|And I thought...
{1021}{1130}I think I'm getting ready for|the depression for when the tour's over.
{1132}{1213}But I really didn't feel emotional|last night.
{1214}{1289}I know everybody else did...
{1291}{1394}but I didn't feel emotional because|it was like it already ended for me.
{1395}{1474}It's like when you know|someone's dying...
{1476}{1544}you have to make your peace|before they die.
{1546}{1635}I've done this with|close friends of mine.
{1637}{1720}I make my peace with it|before it happens...
{1722}{1780}so I don't get really hurt.
{1782}{1852}And then when it happens|it's like...
{1879}{1933}I don't feel anything.
{1935}{1995}But I know I'll feel|something later.
{1997}{2068}I just don't know|when that's gonna be.
{2099}{2172}I guess it's a protection device.
{2220}{2299}I hope I'm in a safe place|when it happens.
{2524}{2586}What's wrong with me?|I'm freaking out.
{2588}{2625}I have 'Japanitis.'
{2685}{2717}Let's walk.
{2914}{2982}Papa don't preach
{2984}{3049}Stop. Stop. Stop.
{3104}{3170}Keith, you motherfucker!
{3247}{3281}Hello.
{3314}{3396}The level up here|is not that loud...
{3398}{3460}and there's no reason|for all this feedback.
{3462}{3561}If we can't get it to sound better|than this, then I'm not doing a show.
{3563}{3667}Some someone who knows about sound|better come up here and explain it.
{3770}{3833}- I'm waiting.|- She's getting pissed.
{3835}{3942}Why can Donna and Niki|not hear themselves?
{4001}{4049}Where's John Draper?
{4076}{4142}She sees me and the smile is gone.
{4144}{4208}- It's because it's raining, Freddy!|- I know.
{4210}{4266}You think it's funny.
{4300}{4364}I don't think it's funny.
{4366}{4437}Get out. I'm having a business talk.
{4438}{4478}Good-bye.
{4545}{4631}Who does she think she is, my mama?|Snatching my head.
{4633}{4700}I only look white.
{4702}{4789}She's really Mabel. Remember|What's Happening? That's her.
{4791}{4862}I was born a poor black child.
{4864}{4904}No rhythm.
{4906}{4967}Look at her hair.|Fuckin' pickaninny lookin' shit.
{5042}{5127}I don't wanna do no makeup|on Madonna, master.
{5129}{5164}I got rhythm.
{5166}{5229}Do it the way it looks smooth.
{5231}{5284}Do you like it over your head?
{5286}{5369}No. The great thing is your hidden|and then you pop out.
{5371}{5450}That's why I asked you if I'm gonna|do it over your head or not?
{5491}{5608}I don't think so.|Take a poll. Ask everybody.
{5610}{5700}- Take a pole?|- Yeah, and ram it up your ass.
{5702}{5776}I'm just kidding.|I'm just kidding, Ollie.
{5778}{5820}No, you said it.
{5822}{5917}Every goddamn day, you throw|this little fag stuff on me.
{6015}{6122}- Don't you know what a poll is?|- Where is a pole? That's a pole.
{6123}{6239}A poll is when you go around|and take--
{6241}{6278}Did you say poll?
{6280}{6373}You're forgiven, Ollie. Everything you|don't know you're forgiven for.
{6375}{6448}Now let mama get her makeup done.
{6577}{6645}Oh, God. I love having children|to watch over.
{6681}{6765}You're not filming me getting an|adjustment. I won't be able to relax.
{6767}{6811}I'm serious.
{6812}{6885}Alec, no. No way.
{6887}{6935}We talked about this in L.A.
{6937}{7002}About me getting an adjustment.
{7032}{7093}Just tune it out.
{7094}{7166}Julie, shut up|and don't tell me to tune it out.
{7416}{7492}It's cold like|a New York winter day.
{7494}{7586}It's snowing weather,|that's what it's like.
{7588}{7662}All of you put black tights on.|Put the bowed costume on.
{7698}{7796}Put your jacket on, and that's|your costume for the night.
{7798}{7847}This is so wild.
{7849}{7943}I'm panicking right now.|Belgium stress.
{7944}{7992}Five minutes, everybody.
{7994}{8047}Show time.
{8111}{8177}Good evening.
{8179}{8268}I don't know about you,|but I'm freezing my ass off.
{8270}{8350}But we're gonna do|a good show for you anyway.
{8515}{8563}For some strange reason...
{8564}{8662}I failed to realize the first leg of the|tour was during Japan's rainy season.
{8664}{8753}So, for three straight weeks|we performed the show in a blizzard.
{8755}{8834}But the dancers are so excited to be|performing for an audience...
{8836}{8903}the world could blow up|and they wouldn't care.
{8905}{8992}I, on the other hand, was not|in the mood for Eskimos on ice.
{8994}{9063}The only thing that kept me|from slashing my wrists...
{9065}{9126}was the thought of coming back|to America...
{9127}{9180}and doing the show|the way it was meant to be.
{10353}{10397}All right, America!
{10424}{10506}Do you believe in love?
{10508}{10609}'Cause I got something to say about it|and it goes like this.
{10611}{10700}Don't go for second best, baby
{10702}{10758}Put your love to the test
{10760}{10811}You know you got to
{10813}{10900}Make him express how he feels
{10902}{10997}And, baby, then you know|your love is real
{11220}{11306}You don't need diamond rings
{11308}{11399}Or 18-karat gold
{11429}{11504}Fancy cars that go very fast
{11506}{11565}You know they never last
{11644}{11711}What you need is a big strong hand
{11713}{11804}To lift you to your higher ground
{11852}{11923}Make you feel like a queen|on a throne
{11925}{12019}Make him love you|till you can't come down
{12452}{12536}Long stem roses|are the way to your heart
{12538}{12632}But he needs|to start with your head
{12659}{12751}Satin sheets are very romantic
{12753}{12841}What happens|when you're not in bed
{12874}{12943}You deserve the best in life
{12944}{13041}So if the time isn't right|then move on
{13085}{13145}Second best is never enough
{13147}{13237}You'd do much better, baby|on your own
{13653}{13695}Express yourself
{13697}{13792}You've got to make him|express himself
{13866}{13929}So if you want it right now
{13931}{13988}Make him show you how
{13990}{14096}Express what he's got|Baby, ready or not
{14932}{15051}And when you're gone|he might regret it
{15053}{15123}Think about the love|he once had
{15125}{15256}You've got to carry on|but he just won't get it
{15258}{15331}He'll be back on his knees|so please
{16138}{16213}Express yourself
{16215}{16287}So you can respect yourself
{16669}{16782}By the time we left Japan,|I was getting attached to the dancers...
{16814}{16916}and I started feeling like|a mother to them.
{16918}{17023}Gabriel, since you never give me|attitude, you get the oldest one.
{17025}{17054}Thank you.
{17056}{17133}When we got to America,|I got to meet the mothers...
{17134}{17218}of all the children|I temporarily claimed as my own.
{17220}{17311}And the parents were usually|as colorful as their kids.
{17313}{17365}It's Mama Make-up.
{17367}{17429}- Is that it?|- Don't we look alike?
{17489}{17534}Happy Mother's Day.
{17602}{17693}Carlton's mom is in the hallway.|I just heard her.
{17834}{17886}- There she is.|- Hi.
{17888}{17964}I want one with her. I must.
{17990}{18049}She is so tiny and cute.
{18050}{18157}Ooh, baby|do you know what that's worth
{18159}{18256}Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
{18305}{18361}Do I have to listen to this?
{18362}{18447}That's why I want my radio on.|Those girls annoy me.
{18481}{18567}It's Donna imitating|Belinda Carlisle.
{18569}{18621}Niki's mommy is singing.
{18650}{18699}I know. I know.
{18761}{18805}That's the one.
{18884}{18949}You know it's a bad sign...
{18950}{19027}when they want you to go on|a half an hour early.
{19029}{19081}Everything's fine.
{19083}{19150}But we're in a conservative town.
{19185}{19280}And that is another reason|to not wanna live in Chicago.
{19282}{19364}Beside for the fact|that Oprah Winfrey lives here.
{19460}{19503}Do you want a T-shirt?
{19504}{19568}I think I have unconsciously...
{19570}{19680}chosen people that are|emotionally crippled in some way.
{19730}{19804}Or who need mothering in some way.|Because...
{19830}{19900}I think it comes natural to me.
{19901}{19990}It fulfills a need in me|to be mothered.
{19992}{20062}Wait a second. You guys.
{20064}{20124}Does Jose love me|more than I love him?
{20126}{20178}- It's not possible.|- Yes.
{20199}{20258}You know what it is?
{20260}{20323}After rehearsal in our hotel room...
{20325}{20374}and guess what this child pumped?
{20452}{20507}Get up off the floor.
{20535}{20583}Don't ever leave me.
{20634}{20722}The innocence of the dancers|move me.
{20724}{20804}They're not jaded in the least.|They haven't been anywhere.
{20806}{20900}This was the opportunity|of their lives.
{20902}{20988}And I know that they've suffered|a great deal in their lives...
{20990}{21081}whether with their families|or just being poor.
{21083}{21178}And I wanted to give them|the thrill of their lives.
{21179}{21249}I wanted to impress them.|I wanted to love them.
{21289}{21352}I'd like to leave a message.
{21354}{21470}Someone is coming. My father|is coming from New Orleans...
{21472}{21542}and he's gonna be here|in 20 minutes.
{21544}{21609}So when he comes,|could you please let him--
{21611}{21734}I haven't seen him in five years. This|is not important to you. I don't care.
{21736}{21820}Let him park in the front, please.
{21822}{21882}No valet. Just let him park.
{21883}{21940}I haven't seen him in a long time.
{22182}{22265}Now that I think about it,|I don't want to meet him.
{22266}{22315}I'm just joking.
{22416}{22471}I'm looking for|a black Cherokee Jeep.
{22645}{22705}Wait, hold up.|There's a Jeep leaving.
{22807}{22839}Bye, Daddy.
{23035}{23062}Hello.
{23129}{23190}Thank you.|He's on his way up.
{23306}{23355}Oh, my God.
{23475}{23511}How you doing?
{23513}{23604}When I saw him, I was disappointed|because we didn't look alike.
{23606}{23647}Not anymore.
{23648}{23726}When I saw him, it was like,|'This was my brother Lance.'
{23728}{23827}- When is your birthday?|- You acted just like Lance.
{23829}{23940}My God, Daddy, if you saw Lance,|you would trip. He acts just like you.
{23942}{24035}- Really?|- This is a trip.
{24037}{24096}I'm disappointed.|You can't meet Madonna now.
{24120}{24185}Ollie, are you okay?
{24223}{24271}What's wrong, baby?
{24294}{24345}Wait a minute.|How's your dad?
{24347}{24414}I believe you.
{24552}{24600}Please tell me--
{24602}{24642}- How was it?|- Yeah.
{24708}{24753}- Were you nervous?|- Oh, no.
{24755}{24825}- Is he coming to the show?|- Yeah.
{24827}{24876}Will you bring him backstage?
{24877}{24920}- After what?|- The show.
{24922}{24967}Bring him back to my room.
{24969}{25057}Now, the reason why I haven't|seen him in five years...
{25059}{25151}and talked to him much|is because he told me...
{25152}{25228}'Oliver, you're not gonna make it.|I wish you'd stop dancing.'
{25230}{25313}When he got to Houston,|we had a talk about this.
{25315}{25364}Then he asked me to forgive him...
{25365}{25449}which I never heard from him before.
{25451}{25503}And I forgave him.
{25593}{25658}I guess he felt happy.
{25957}{26025}Oh, Father
{26027}{26105}If you never wanted|to live that way
{26107}{26185}If you never wanted|to hurt me
{26187}{26254}Why am I running away
{26649}{26720}Maybe someday
{26722}{26776}When I look back
{26778}{26863}I'll be able to say
{26885}{26997}You didn't mean to be cruel
{26999}{27091}And somebody hurt you too
{27112}{27215}You can't hurt me now
{27240}{27319}I got away from you
{27320}{27386}I never thought I would
{27413}{27545}You can't make me cry
{27547}{27606}You once had the power
{27631}{27693}I never felt so good
{27695}{27803}About myself
{29106}{29138}- Hello?|- Dad?
{29140}{29178}- Yes!|- Hi, it's me.
{29180}{29244}- Hi. How are you?|- Listen.
{29284}{29408}I realize I haven't talked to you|in a while and I hope all is good.
{29410}{29541}But I have no idea what night|you guys are coming to the show.
{29543}{29629}And all that stuff.|So, what's going on?
{29631}{29678}Your nights were changed.
{29679}{29777}Who wants to come? And when?
{29779}{29822}Whatever--
{29864}{29938}I'd love it if you'd come|to both shows.
{29940}{30036}It's pretty racy. I don't know|if you could take it two nights.
{30038}{30091}You had to get racy on me?
{30092}{30158}Dad, I'm not getting racy.|I've been racy.
{30160}{30235}- Can't you tone it down a bit?|- For you?
{30237}{30314}That would be compromising|my artistic integrity.
{30316}{30414}Of course. Do you undress|in this performance?
{30416}{30489}No! Of course I don't.
{30535}{30586}Whatever you can get tickets for.
{30588}{30660}Dad, I can get you tickets|any night you wanna come.
{30662}{30755}- That would be great.|- How many tickets do you want?
{30757}{30823}But you gotta tell me now|and who they're for.
{30825}{30887}- Martin and a friend.|- How's Marty doing?
{30888}{30979}- We took him to--|- Did he go to the rehab center?
{30981}{31045}He's there.|He's getting out on the 25.
{31047}{31127}- The 25?|- The reason I called...
{31128}{31192}is he wanted to know|if he could do this?
{31194}{31238}Do what?
{31240}{31335}- He wants to have a party.|- Dad, I'll tell you something.
{31337}{31425}This is really grueling show|and tour.
{31427}{31535}It's not like when I played stadiums|where I do one show then have days off.
{31536}{31579}These are back-to-back.
{31581}{31684}I don't like to go out and party|because I lose my voice.
{31686}{31766}Halfway through 'Get lnto The Groove,'|the monitors went off on stage.
{31767}{31867}I cannot hear myself! And he's|standing there like he doesn't know.
{31869}{31964}I don't think I really anticipated|how draining the show was gonna be.
{31966}{32044}My brother Christopher warned me|I was gonna regret it.
{32046}{32130}But by the time I realized|he was right it was too late.
{32132}{32185}Definitely, one of|the all-time worst.
{32187}{32293}It wasn't just the physical aspect.|There were so many technical things.
{32295}{32385}So many little things that could|fuck up and, boy, did they.
{32670}{32727}Never want to turn your back
{32778}{32836}The monitors have|never done it before.
{32838}{32917}Something going on in the building|we didn't have at sound check.
{32919}{33034}I wanna check everywhere to make sure|this doesn't happen again...
{33036}{33087}'cause it happened in|'Where's the Party .'
{33089}{33177}You don't understand|there's no way of checking things--
{33179}{33233}How come it's not happening|to Niki and Donna?
{33235}{33325}I have no answer because there's|something close to your frequency--
{33327}{33379}If you don't find an answer--
{33410}{33485}I'm singing a cappella|and my headset goes out...
{33487}{33547}and everybody thinks the show|is over with.
{33548}{33612}How come it didn't happen|to the girls?
{33613}{33676}We're all on separate frequencies.
{33678}{33772}Put me on their fucking frequency.|And you know.
{33975}{34016}Motherfuck!
{34018}{34047}Ouch!
{34112}{34222}Somebody stuck some big fat man|up in the front to give me dirty looks.
{34223}{34272}I swear to God.
{34334}{34412}And don't hide back there, Warren.|Get over here.
{34414}{34466}- Freddy?|- Yes, ma'am?
{34468}{34523}- You lied.|- What did I lie about?
{34524}{34595}There was only industry people|in the first two rows.
{34597}{34681}- I didn't like that.|- You said there wasn't gonna be any.
{34683}{34784}- I don't how they got there.|- They totally bummed me out.
{34785}{34893}They sat there with their arms folded,|dirty looks on their faces.
{34895}{34981}I swear to God. Do something else.|Do my eyebrows.
{34983}{35071}It was so distracting|and so depressing to me...
{35073}{35176}to have two rows of people looking like|they weren't there to have fun.
{35178}{35258}- What's the point?|- Everyone in the pit was dancing.
{35260}{35357}Freddy, fuck you! There was not.
{35359}{35426}There were three rows of assholes|and then a space.
{35428}{35534}I tried to change it, and|I'm trying to change it for tomorrow.
{35536}{35588}I want it changed.|And John Draper.
{35590}{35675}- Hi.|- Please give Keith a new asshole...
{35677}{35802}because he's in charge|of my show, the sound of it.
{35804}{35897}- Are you talking about the very end?|- It wasn't the very end.
{35899}{35986}It was in 'Causing a Commotion'|and 'Open Your Heart'...
{35987}{36056}and 'Keep It Together'|and 'Where's The Party' and 'Vogue'...
{36058}{36121}my sound kept coming out|on my headset.
{36123}{36203}- Kept cutting out?|- Don't tell me you didn't know.
{36204}{36269}- In 'Keep It Together.'|- No. Yeah.
{36271}{36370}- You were particularly awesome.|- I thought it was killer.
{36371}{36424}Unbelievable.
{36425}{36465}- Thank you.|- Awesome.
{36467}{36550}- People could see it.|- See how good I am when I'm pissed off?
{36551}{36616}- If that's what it takes.|- No, please, Freddy.
{36618}{36699}I thought you were in the greatest mood|because you were really putting out.
{36701}{36754}- The crowd was--|- The crowd was tough.
{36756}{36825}It was a tough crowd on the sides|because it's L.A.
{36827}{36944}Look, everyone looked like a goddamn|William Morris agent in the first rows.
{36946}{37003}Okay, that's it, Freddy.
{37059}{37107}You stink.
{37109}{37178}You pussy, man.|Get over here.
{37210}{37252}What is with you?
{37254}{37336}Can you believe|I have to do this every night?
{37338}{37411}Are you gonna be|nicer to me now, Warren?
{37483}{37524}What?
{37864}{37897}Where are you going?
{37941}{38016}Bring some people back because|I have to go home and go to sleep.
{38075}{38164}Liz, you look|really well rested... not.
{38165}{38229}I'm trying to turn Warren|into a vegetarian.
{38267}{38350}I told him I wouldn't have his baby|unless he was a vegetarian.
{38352}{38381}Not!
{38517}{38614}- The lights are good here. Don't worry.|- It's good if you lie down.
{38616}{38688}- That's AI Pacino.|- Hi. Nice to meet you.
{38689}{38757}- That's Mandy Patinkin.|- How are you? Nice to meet you.
{38759}{38809}Los Angeles was hard that way.
{38811}{38898}I've found it weird for celebrities|to assume a friendship with you...
{38900}{38949}because you're a celebrity.
{38950}{39009}It can get kind of awkward.
{39011}{39075}Warren thanks you all for coming.
{39107}{39147}Hi.
{39149}{39194}- You were great.|- Thank you.
{39196}{39276}Thanks for having us.|It was really generous.
{39278}{39339}- Thanks for coming.|- We thought it was neat.
{39341}{39382}- 'Neat?'|- Really neat.
{39384}{39441}No one's ever described it as that.
{39443}{39519}Have fun. We won't be making|that other deal.
{39521}{39593}- Not neat enough for you.|- Not quite.
{39594}{39689}We've gotta get the kids.
{39690}{39739}And give them this.
{39764}{39835}- Thanks.|- God bless. Thanks.
{39943}{40032}Neat? Anybody who says my show|is 'neat' has to go.
{40055}{40102}He loves me.
{40104}{40152}He loves me not.
{40434}{40496}He just wants to fuck me.
{40498}{40550}He really cares about me.
{40761}{40803}- Uh-oh.|- What?
{40805}{40883}I ended on a 'He loves me not.'|Does this little one count?
{40885}{40952}- Not if you don't want it to.|- There's two there.
{40986}{41045}- There are not two.|- Make it not count.
{41047}{41131}It's one. He loves me all right.
{41133}{41220}Warren told me Edie Sedgewick|wanted to meet him.
{41249}{41330}He said, 'Okay,'|'cause he was curious...
{41332}{41411}as any red-blooded American male|would have been.
{41472}{41606}She came over, and he said she had|a completely see-through raincoat on...
{41608}{41670}and nothing on underneath it.
{41671}{41720}Isn't that funny?
{41748}{41801}He didn't fuck her.
{41803}{41852}Isn't that unusual?
{41884}{41975}- Do you really like them?|- What do you think People will say?
{42007}{42122}I remember when I told Warren|to bring me a present. He did.
{42124}{42229}He brought me this really cool|shirt from Dolce and Grebano.
{42231}{42292}See? I get what I want.
{42294}{42357}May I speak to Warren Beatty please?
{42461}{42534}He doesn't even have|a fake name.
{42585}{42692}Warren, you're supposed to be here.|It's 5:30.
{42694}{42796}If you don't get over here now,|I'm leaving without you.
{42825}{42906}I did too.|I never said that.
{42955}{43004}What an asshole!
{43176}{43214}Ow.
{43291}{43363}I had a dream last night...
{43365}{43444}that Gorbachev came to my show.
{43446}{43495}My first reaction was...
{43547}{43647}that Warren was gonna be so jealous|I got to meet him first.
{43679}{43747}Anyway, it was a good dream.
{44010}{44065}The police are here.
{44156}{44267}You can't do the masturbation scene|tonight or you'll be arrested.
{44268}{44310}- Really?|- Uh-huh.
{44312}{44375}Oh, good, let's see what happens.
{44377}{44460}- They will do it.|- What, jump on stage?
{44462}{44523}- They'll wait till after the show.|- They'll arrest you after.
{44524}{44583}- Are you guys serious?|- Totally serious.
{44585}{44634}Clay is down there with Freddy.
{44635}{44724}- So what's considered masturbation?|- Sticking your hand on your crotch.
{44726}{44818}But then another one of our options|is to cancel the show.
{44875}{44949}- If you choose that, we won't play.|- It's your choice.
{44951}{45071}We're asking for that, and it's|your choice. It's in your hands.
{45073}{45154}- We'll have to pay a fine?|- We'll have to cancel the show.
{45156}{45214}They'll probably take you|to the station.
{45216}{45300}Write you a ticket. You'll pay for it.|You'd be in every paper.
{45302}{45375}Yeah! I'm not changing|my fucking show.
{45377}{45508}I think I need some legal advice|from a Canadian attorney...
{45509}{45558}before I make a decision.
{45586}{45645}- You're lying.|- I am not lying.
{45647}{45749}I swear to God. The police and a|representative from the D.A.'s office.
{45751}{45827}Two plain clothes policemen|saw the show.
{45829}{45866}- Really?|- Yesterday.
{45868}{45949}- And they said--|- Immoral live performance.
{46037}{46095}You shouldn't have told me.
{46097}{46168}It might prepare you for this|with the police standing there.
{46170}{46196}Did you guys hear?
{46198}{46255}- What?|- That the police are here.
{46257}{46333}-Why?|-If I touch my crotch, I'll be arrested.
{46334}{46372}Are you serious?
{46439}{46516}They arrested Bobby Brown|for fucking on stage.
{46518}{46594}- That's called jealousy.|- I hope he's in jail when I get there.
{46596}{46660}My question is|does it help legally--
{46662}{46737}Strictly as a legal question,|if we go on stage...
{46739}{46821}and someone says, 'This show|may contain graphic material--'
{46822}{46877}Doesn't work. Not here.
{46879}{46937}We are going to jail.|I'm so excited.
{46938}{46997}Dear Lord...
{46998}{47057}this is our last night|in Toronto...
{47059}{47131}the fascist state of Toronto.
{47133}{47246}All my babies are feeling fragile,|and I want you all to know...
{47248}{47330}I love you all and I appreciate|everything you're doing for me...
{47332}{47375}and I'm here if you need me.
{47377}{47482}I want you to go out there tonight|and give everything you have.
{47484}{47571}Have a great show. Remember,|in the United States of America...
{47573}{47633}there is freedom of speech.
{47699}{47748}And let's kick ass.
{47809}{47872}Are we gonna go to jail or what?
{47874}{47947}I ain't changing my show.
{47949}{48009}I'll give you the options.
{48011}{48073}They just told me that|there's been complaints...
{48075}{48148}that there are simulated orgasms,|blah, blah, blah.
{48150}{48240}It's against their rules|and regulations.
{48242}{48291}I am not changing my show.
{48293}{48372}I know you're not, but can you wait five|minutes for me to straighten it out?
{48374}{48478}- What's to straighten out?|- Hopefully we can change their mind.
{48480}{48572}All you have to do is tell them|I'm not changing my show.
{48573}{48669}I am an artist and this is how I express|myself. What do you have to tell them?
{48802}{48890}We shall overcome
{48988}{49114}She has told me that this is|artistic freedom. This is her show.
{49116}{49244}It's gone in several countries|in major cities across the world.
{49246}{49342}In Canada, if you choose|to do that...
{49344}{49411}I'm sure it will be|an international scandal.
{49515}{49608}God, everything's gonna have|a whole new meaning in the show.
{49609}{49714}Like when I say 'God,' I'll be praying|that I don't get arrested.
{49765}{49814}Where else am I nasty?
{49815}{49864}Everywhere.
{49866}{49936}We're gonna realize tonight|how many places we do this.
{49938}{50059}Say, 'Toronto, you believe in freedom?|I got something to say about it.'
{50061}{50126}- Chris, don't let them take me.|- They won't.
{50127}{50188}Celebration
{50190}{50222}Come together
{50223}{50288}In every nation
{50290}{50348}- That's right.|- Holiday
{50543}{50580}Get arrested for that.
{50581}{50668}Consequences is they may detain her|after the show...
{50670}{50725}and charge her with indecency.
{50726}{50812}Last time I was on tour,|Sean was in jail. I guess it's my turn.
{50862}{50921}She'll do it, but she won't--
{50922}{50979}Bet she does it more.
{51020}{51093}- How much you wanna bet?|- I'll bet something small.
{51094}{51143}I'll trust you.
{52062}{52181}I made it through the wilderness
{52183}{52279}Somehow I made it through
{52345}{52431}Didn't know how lost I was
{52433}{52500}Until I found you
{52549}{52612}I was beat
{52614}{52653}Incomplete
{52677}{52731}I'd been had
{52733}{52802}I was sad and blue
{52803}{52891}But you made me feel
{52933}{53031}Yeah, you made me feel
{53033}{53114}Shiny and new
{53166}{53241}Like a virgin
{53288}{53381}Touched for the very first time
{53427}{53519}Like a virgin
{53557}{53628}When your heart beats
{53630}{53664}Next to mine
{53666}{53753}Gonna give you all my love, boy
{53793}{53893}My fear is fading fast
{53955}{54033}Been saving it all for you
{54035}{54120}'Cause only love can last
{54161}{54210}You're so fine
{54227}{54265}And you're mine
{54290}{54346}Make me strong
{54347}{54414}Yeah, you make me bold
{54416}{54496}'Cause your love thawed out
{54543}{54632}Yeah, your love thawed out
{54634}{54729}What was scared and cold
{56272}{56328}You're so fine
{56329}{56393}And you're mine
{56395}{56452}I'll be yours
{56454}{56522}Till the end of time
{56524}{56601}'Cause you made me feel
{56642}{56732}Yeah, you made me feel
{56751}{56837}I'd nothing to hide
{57597}{57665}Feels so good inside
{57706}{57748}When you hold me
{57771}{57817}And your heart beats
{57838}{57883}And you love me
{58641}{58717}Spokesman for rock singer Madonna|say Metro police...
{58719}{58807}and Crown Attorney's office threatened|to arrest the star last night...
{58809}{58863}for lewd and obscene behavior.
{58865}{58954}However, the police department tonight|has a different story.
{58956}{59060}Headquarters said officers checked out|the show on complaints...
{59062}{59130}found nothing wrong|and left without incident.
{59131}{59192}Madonna released a statement|from Michigan saying...
{59194}{59276}she would rather cancel the show|than alter it.
{59277}{59408}Detroit was definitely the hardest|place we went to on the tour...
{59410}{59464}at an emotional level.
{59505}{59560}God, going home is--
{59562}{59630}Well, it's just never|that easy for me.
{59632}{59747}People always talk about|how stardom changes you...
{59749}{59810}but they never talk about how it can|change the people close to you.
{59812}{59835}Hi, Marty.
{59837}{59893}- Who is that?|- How you doin'?
{59895}{59943}How's it going?
{60015}{60084}- This is my brother Martin.|- Hi, Marty.
{60086}{60161}This is Donna.|Don't pay any attention to her.
{60200}{60294}- Niki, you gonna say hi to Marty?|- Hi, Marty.
{60296}{60365}I feel that there is a pressure.
{60367}{60424}Because of my sister people say...
{60426}{60499}'How come you're not that?|How come you're not the manager?
{60501}{60604}How come you're not this,|the other?
{60605}{60660}You should be this, that.
{60662}{60723}There is something|they measure against you.
{60725}{60778}And sometimes I cop an attitude.
{60780}{60837}But I deal with it.
{60896}{60960}Well, she's available.
{60962}{61041}Why don't you talk to her?|She's taking a nap now.
{61043}{61150}I'm gonna be back here probably|around 7:00.
{61152}{61232}I can't see anybody|till after the show.
{61283}{61338}Sounds good. See ya, hon.
{61339}{61423}We're tight. We talk and stuff.
{61425}{61495}She gives me advice|and I give her a few tips...
{61496}{61549}and she gives me a few tips.
{61551}{61634}We really have|a give-and-take relationship.
{61662}{61715}We can get past that star bullshit.
{61717}{61767}She knows what time|it is with me...
{61769}{61818}and I know what time|it is with her.
{61820}{61902}Dear Lord, it seems like every time|I'm standing here before the show...
{61903}{61999}I'm asking for something extra special,|but I'm here again.
{62001}{62060}They say, 'Ask and you shall receive.'
{62062}{62168}So, I'm begging You to give me|a voice to sing with this evening...
{62169}{62205}and the girls too.
{62207}{62308}This is my hometown,|so I'm extra nervous.
{62310}{62390}And even though|it's not supposed to matter...
{62392}{62457}it does matter what they think.
{62459}{62548}And so I ask You...
{62550}{62602}to give me...
{62604}{62671}that little extra something special...
{62672}{62758}to show everybody here|that I did...
{62759}{62824}make something out of my life, amen.
{62826}{62874}Have a great show.
{63011}{63088}I said it last night,|and I'll say it again.
{63090}{63143}There's no place like home.
{63315}{63376}In addition to that...
{63378}{63475}there's nobody like this man.
{63477}{63572}There's nobody like my father...
{63574}{63634}who is here tonight.
{63636}{63724}And I worship the ground|that he walks on.
{63726}{63805}And it's his birthday tonight.
{63807}{63917}I was wondering if I could sing 'Happy|Birthday' in front of 20,000 people?
{64161}{64210}This is my dad.
{64388}{64481}I was wondering if|you would all sing it with me.
{64543}{64591}Ready?
{64593}{64668}Happy birthday to you
{64762}{64789}I can't hear you.
{64805}{64879}Happy birthday
{64881}{64956}Dear Dad
{64958}{65036}Happy birthday
{65038}{65126}To you
{65346}{65409}Dad, I love you.
{65411}{65484}Detroit, I love you.|Good night.
{65519}{65567}Thank you.
{65720}{65778}So, did my father disown me?
{65816}{65861}- He looked so happy.|- Really?
{65862}{65943}Oh, God, I was so afraid|to do 'Like A Virgin.'
{65945}{66011}- I could tell you were.|- I was like--
{66082}{66131}Okay, I'm done with that now.
{66196}{66288}Oh, my God. It was harder|to do that show...
{66290}{66356}than the police in Toronto.
{66358}{66446}I was more afraid of what|my actions would result in.
{66480}{66533}Are you ready for Dad?
{66535}{66613}Dad, you can come in,|but I gotta get dressed. Come in.
{66615}{66693}Hi. I better take off|my sweaty clothes.
{66752}{66815}- You're soaking.|- Sorry.
{66817}{66882}Let me change.|Did you like the show?
{66884}{66969}- It was great.|- It was very good. Wonderful.
{66971}{67045}A little touchy in spots,|but it was great.
{67265}{67318}I didn't expect 'Happy Birthday.'
{67320}{67422}Oh, man. I tried not to start|bawling in front of everybody.
{67527}{67576}It's hard to sing and cry.
{67577}{67633}Now you know why I'm wiped out.
{67635}{67747}It's exhausting just watching|everything that's going on around.
{67809}{67864}I can't do this|for another two months.
{67866}{67921}I'm sure you're relieved it's over.
{67923}{68001}That one's over.|That was a big one.
{68003}{68047}I'm so tired.
{68049}{68181}The minute you turn your head,|the stuff is all lit on the stage.
{68238}{68314}Hi. I'm getting a touch-up.
{68316}{68359}You take a shower already?
{68421}{68515}I never thought I'd see you|bow at your father's foot.
{68517}{68597}- I thought that was great.|- I never thought I would either.
{68598}{68694}I was honored.|A little taken back, but honored.
{68696}{68789}I thought I had to make up since|I didn't get you a birthday present.
{68816}{68887}Weren't the sets beautiful?|Didn't Chris do a great job?
{68889}{68951}Aren't my dancers great?
{68953}{69048}It was all great.|Some scenes there were...
{69050}{69097}- X-rated?|- burlesque.
{69099}{69195}Dad. You don't understand.|They all lead to something.
{69196}{69277}- Art.|- It's got nothing to do with art.
{69279}{69369}It's a journey that you go on.
{69371}{69434}You get on this train,|you have to stay on to the end.
{69436}{69512}Exactly. You take a journey.|It's cathartic.
{69513}{69598}You can't get to one place|without going to another place.
{69651}{69703}It's like growing up.
{69705}{69765}That's what my show is like.
{69767}{69815}She's growing up on stage.
{69865}{69913}My brother's gonna come.
{69915}{69992}If he has a few friends,|that's fine.
{69994}{70062}But if he brings a lot of people...
{70064}{70137}then I want you|to come in here...
{70139}{70191}and be the chaperon...
{70193}{70253}because my brother's crazy.
{70255}{70333}- I know.|- You have to be nice too.
{70335}{70401}He can't help it.
{70403}{70451}Thank you.
{70489}{70584}What's my fart poem?|Should I say it?
{70586}{70661}Which one?|The one about the beans?
{70758}{70821}I'm replenishing my fluids.
{70823}{70889}A fart is a chemical substance.
{70891}{70951}It comes from a place|called Bum.
{70952}{71024}It penetrates through the trousers...
{71058}{71118}and lands with a musical hum.
{71120}{71174}To fart is no disgrace...
{71176}{71224}for it gives the body ease.
{71226}{71338}It warms the blankets on cold winter|nights and suffocates the fleas.
{71427}{71500}And. Angie said...
{71531}{71591}'You're not gonna stay|and see Marty?'
{71593}{71642}Don't leave me alone.
{71673}{71743}- I'll be here in spirit.|- Bastard.
{71745}{71827}We went out to get the limousine|and the driver was gone...
{71829}{71918}because the guy who owned the service|locked his keys in his car.
{71920}{71950}So I had to wait.
{71952}{72050}He probably stopped at a bar|for 12 drinks.
{72116}{72169}No, he didn't.|He's cleaned up.
{72171}{72216}Oh, yeah.
{72252}{72344}Dad says he went to alcohol rehab|to escape going to jail.
{72346}{72410}'He went there|for the wrong reasons.
{72412}{72524}It wasn't proper motivation.|He doesn't wanna heal himself.
{72565}{72613}Did Martin come yet?
{72615}{72662}Did he show up yet?
{72692}{72744}Oh, well. Thanks.
{72837}{72887}Martin was supposed to come...
{72889}{72936}but he didn't.
{72938}{72986}Big deal.
{73057}{73158}I think Martin's not coming.|I'm going to bed.
{73160}{73208}C.
{73210}{73285}If my brother comes,|you just tell him...
{73287}{73360}that I'd like privacy, please.
{73472}{73532}- Hi, Martin.|- How you doing?
{73534}{73643}- Listen to that low voice.|- I made it lower for you.
{73644}{73726}- You been crying?|- My Visine.
{73763}{73823}My eyes got sore.|Where are you going?
{73824}{73900}- Have a drink with my family.|- You coming back up?
{73902}{73953}- I'll be back up.|- Where's she at?
{73955}{74015}She's probably sleeping.|Most likely.
{74073}{74123}401 I got to find.
{74125}{74192}I'll be right back.
{74194}{74241}- What are you looking for?|- 401.
{74243}{74314}- It's right there.|- It's right here?
{74343}{74411}It was right in front of me|the whole time.
{75142}{75204}She's probably sleeping.
{75243}{75291}Good night.
{75494}{75587}Sharon, I beat up girls like you|when I was little.
{75646}{75707}It's true. You know who|she reminds me of?
{75709}{75769}- Who?|- Of the McFarlands.
{75797}{75848}Maureen McFarland.
{75952}{76004}- Hello. Hi.|- Are you Maureen?
{76048}{76086}You guys.
{76088}{76202}They're a nice family.|If you think our family's wacky.
{76204}{76256}I won't say anymore.
{76258}{76350}There was a time about ten years ago|that I was in Colorado...
{76352}{76447}and I was gonna go to New York|to see her 'cause she was there...
{76449}{76536}and I never made it.
{76538}{76646}I was a dancer on the road.|Different kind. I was topless.
{76648}{76697}I was really into drugs.
{76699}{76796}But Moira McFarland taught me|how to shave my legs.
{76836}{76906}Let me borrow her stuffed bra.
{76908}{76980}- How old were you?|- Showed me how to use Tampons.
{76982}{77063}Not very well, I might add.|And taught me how to make out.
{77065}{77166}Madonna, I did not teach you|how to insert a Tampon.
{77168}{77299}And if we got in bed together naked,|I don't remember that.
{77301}{77408}She said she was never in bed|naked with me? She's a liar.
{77410}{77471}She's got an active imagination.
{77472}{77529}She's a liar.|Did she say she finger-fucked me?
{77559}{77654}I remember looking at her bush.|I know.
{77656}{77772}See what happens when you take drugs|and alcohol. I lose a lot of stuff.
{77773}{77889}I remember the crack in her parent's|bed because it was two beds together.
{77891}{77949}I remember I fell through the crack.
{77951}{78028}We were naked jumping up and down|on the bed too much.
{78030}{78120}The last time|I really saw her before...
{78158}{78240}before she became a star...
{78242}{78291}was when I was in tenth grade.
{78293}{78350}Where's my idol?
{78412}{78462}I don't know if I'm nervous.
{78464}{78525}I just wanna see Madonna.
{78571}{78648}- You didn't recognize me?|- I didn't know you were coming out.
{78650}{78725}- I don't have my glasses on.|- So, how are you?
{78727}{78806}When you see the show, you'll forgive|me for not talking to you.
{78808}{78858}It's really difficult.
{78859}{78944}I know. I got five boys.
{78945}{79023}I gotta ask you something.|Can we sit down?
{79025}{79096}I can't sit down. I'm sorry.|What's up?
{79098}{79210}About four years ago,|I wrote you a letter.
{79212}{79346}You never received it. I asked you|if you would be Mario's godmother.
{79347}{79422}- I remember that.|- Did you read it?
{79423}{79499}I got it a long time|after the fact.
{79501}{79568}Well, very unexpectedly.
{79569}{79634}Real unexpectedly,|I'm pregnant again.
{79636}{79705}Really? Oh, my God.
{79779}{79868}I want you to be|the baby's godmother.
{79870}{79909}- Really?|- I really do.
{79911}{80016}You're coming tonight?|And Melissa has all your phone numbers?
{80018}{80107}- This is too rushed.|- I know.
{80109}{80196}I'm really flattered that you're asking|me, but I have to think about it.
{80243}{80328}- But that's really sweet.|- It's nothing to do with religion.
{80330}{80389}- I know.|- It's spirituality.
{80391}{80466}Do I get to decide on the name?
{80468}{80592}As long as it's the same as yours.|Except you've got to bless this child.
{80594}{80685}-Bless this and say, 'She needs a girl.'|-I would bless it anyways.
{80687}{80735}Have a girl, Moira.
{80788}{80871}I gotta go. Come out a girl|and we're gonna call you Madonna.
{80873}{80940}- All right, gimme a kiss and hug.|- I love you.
{80942}{81008}- I hope you like the show.|- I have something for you.
{81010}{81056}Is that the painting?
{81058}{81138}I'm gonna put it in my room.|Clay, come on.
{81140}{81193}I love this painting.
{81195}{81247}Thank you.
{81249}{81334}Thanks. I'm gonna put it|in my room. I love you too.
{81336}{81419}- And you call me after the tour.|- I will.
{81420}{81482}- Promise?|- I promise. Bye.
{81484}{81559}- I love you, Madonna.|- I love you too.
{81585}{81635}You little shit.
{81637}{81746}Look. Moira made|this painting for me.
{81748}{81816}- She did it herself?|- She did.
{81818}{81910}It's a Madonna and Child,|no pun intended.
{81933}{81985}It's not bad, really.
{82203}{82253}That's me breast-feeding.
{82255}{82304}Yeah, I got that.
{82340}{82415}Did you hear me dedicate|a song to her?
{82417}{82464}- I didn't hear that.|- I did.
{82466}{82519}In 'Where's the Party.'
{82521}{82633}I said, 'This one's for Moira,|my childhood idol.'
{82635}{82731}I remember praying to Madonna,|to her mother Madonna.
{82733}{82783}It was the closest thing to God.
{82984}{83081}When her mom died,|I was a little girl and I couldn't--
{83083}{83149}I remember feeling...
{83151}{83210}really sad and...
{83212}{83261}really awful.
{83332}{83395}But I don't know that anybody went--
{83397}{83501}I don't remember hugging Madonna|and telling her I'm sorry...
{83503}{83552}'cause I didn't understand.
{83553}{83602}I was seven and she was five.
{83603}{83682}So I just wanted to go back|and hug her.
{83811}{83874}Little girl
{83876}{83976}Don't you forget her face
{83978}{84080}Laughing away your tears
{84082}{84216}When she was the one|who felt all the pain
{84285}{84343}Little girl
{84345}{84448}Never forget her eyes
{84450}{84547}Keep them alive inside
{84548}{84623}I promise to try
{84650}{84744}But it's not the same
{84785}{84876}I hadn't been to the cemetery|since I was a young girl.
{84878}{84940}We used to go|right after she died.
{84942}{85053}My mother's death was a big mystery|to me when I was a child.
{85055}{85113}And no one really explained it.
{85163}{85234}What I remember most about her...
{85236}{85292}was that she was--
{85294}{85395}She was very kind and very gentle|and very feminine.
{85397}{85463}I guess she seemed|like an angel to me...
{85465}{85570}but I suppose everybody thinks their|mother's an angel when they're five.
{85572}{85653}I also know|she was really religious...
{85655}{85774}so I never really understood why|she was taken away from us.
{85776}{85831}It seemed so unfair.
{85833}{85903}I never thought that she|had done something wrong...
{85905}{85978}so oftentimes I wondered|what I had done wrong.
{85980}{86068}Does she hear my voice
{86070}{86122}In the night when I call
{86124}{86180}Wipe away all your tears
{86182}{86288}It's gonna be all right
{86450}{86552}I fought to be so strong
{86554}{86607}I guess you knew
{86609}{86675}I was afraid
{86708}{86786}You'd go away too
{86898}{86965}I wonder what she looks like now.
{86997}{87053}Just a bunch of dust.
{87131}{87182}I'm going to fit in right here.
{87184}{87248}They're gonna bury me sideways.
{87402}{87500}You've got to forget the past
{87501}{87590}And learn to forgive me
{87592}{87681}I promise to try
{87712}{87785}But feels like a lie
{87835}{87914}Don't let memory
{87916}{87989}Play games with your mind
{88049}{88145}She's a faded smile
{88147}{88191}Frozen in time
{88193}{88234}I'm still hangin' on
{88236}{88322}But I'm doin' it wrong
{88360}{88413}I don't want to stay here anymore.
{88444}{88540}Can't kiss her good-bye
{88563}{88675}But I promise to try
{88834}{88895}This is a show...
{88897}{88969}that I have no idea|what is gonna happen to my voice.
{88970}{89075}I don't know where it's gonna|come from, but give me a voice...
{89077}{89142}and let me put on|a great show tonight.
{89144}{89228}And let everybody do the same, amen.
{89230}{89292}It's like a dream
{89332}{89421}No end and no beginning
{89446}{89494}You're here with me
{89577}{89645}Let the choir sing
{89647}{89696}Stand back, please.
{89822}{89869}Now say--
{89917}{89953}Breathe.
{90075}{90108}Good.
{90436}{90473}Great. Take a breath.
{90502}{90553}- Good.|- This is crazy.
{90555}{90640}- Nobody talks about this on film?|- Talks about what?
{90641}{90725}The insanity of doing this|all on a documentary.
{90727}{90816}- Why?|- This is a serious matter, your throat.
{90846}{90913}Why should I stop here?
{90915}{90991}- But does anyone say it?|- Who's 'anyone'?
{90992}{91066}Anyone that comes|into this insane atmosphere.
{91068}{91153}You realize they feel it|when they come into this atmosphere.
{91154}{91254}When they come to wherever you are,|they feel crazy.
{91256}{91355}- Now, do they talk about it?|- No. They accept it.
{91357}{91426}- Why don't they talk about it?|- 'Cause.
{91428}{91501}- You want to think about that.|- No, I don't.
{91503}{91567}Let's get back to my throat.
{91633}{91730}Do you want to talk at all|off camera?
{91757}{91855}She doesn't want to live off camera,|much less talk.
{91892}{91940}There's nothing to say off camera.
{91942}{92010}Why would you say something|if it's off camera?
{92012}{92085}What point is there, existing?
{92118}{92191}Eventually, I had to admit|that I was a human being...
{92193}{92252}and agreed to cancel some shows.
{92254}{92290}What did she say?
{92291}{92378}I was told by the doctor|that I couldn't speak...
{92380}{92483}and I had to write|everything down on paper.
{92511}{92579}Melissa, my assistant, became...
{92581}{92646}my only link|to the outside world.
{92648}{92732}In a lot of ways, New York|and the time I spent there...
{92734}{92803}while I was sick|was the hardest on her.
{92805}{92872}Since I was staying in my apartment|in New York...
{92874}{92923}I lost contact with the dancers.
{92924}{93013}I had to give|all my messages to Melissa.
{93014}{93121}Through Melissa I heard they were|finding a lot to keep themselves busy.
{93123}{93214}I guess I was a little jealous|their lives were going on without me.
{93215}{93301}Donna Delory,|Madonna's backup singer...
{93303}{93363}also dancer on the tour.
{93365}{93434}- Donna, good to have you with us.|- It's great to be here.
{93436}{93520}Who choreographed|that 'Like A Virgin' number?
{93522}{93566}Who do you think?
{93568}{93608}Warren Beatty.
{93637}{93685}So, Warren.
{93687}{93771}You know, Donna,|I was reading the radio bible...
{93773}{93846}which I happen|to have a copy of here.
{93848}{93907}That thing is so wrong.
{93909}{93975}Let me read this first,|then you can comment.
{93977}{94036}'Madonna Dumps Beatty|For a Black Dancer.'
{94038}{94108}It talks about Slam.
{94110}{94216}'Madonna Swaps Beatty|For Dancer 31 Years Younger.'
{94218}{94285}First of all,|that guy's name is Oliver.
{94287}{94371}These guys are so wrong,|they didn't get the name right.
{94372}{94447}This is my first time|ever working with fags.
{94449}{94533}I'm the only straight guy,|and it's six of them.
{94534}{94615}We're here. We're queer.|Get used to it.
{94808}{94884}Oh, my God.|You know what else I hate?
{94886}{94950}Have you ever seen...
{94952}{95016}Luis walk in just underwear...
{95018}{95060}in front of|a whole bunch of people?
{95062}{95164}Just walk around in bikini,|just underwear.
{95166}{95236}Don't have no respect|for these people.
{95238}{95337}We know that he's a fag, or gay,|or whatever you want to call it...
{95339}{95392}but you don't have|to show it to everybody.
{95393}{95463}- We know you're happy.|- Hi, boys.
{95464}{95569}We know you're glad to be it,|but you don't have to show it...
{95571}{95644}Iet everybody know|that you're a fag.
{95645}{95692}Work, girl!
{95694}{95775}It was scary. It really was.
{95776}{95825}They wanted me.
{95826}{95931}And their thing was:|On this tour, we're gonna get him.
{95932}{95982}That's what they told me.
{96714}{96791}When the show started up again,|everything felt different.
{96793}{96861}There was so much tension.|I blamed myself.
{96863}{96938}I felt like a mother|who'd deserted her kids...
{96939}{97033}then comes back home to realize|how much trouble they've gotten into.
{97035}{97087}Don't touch my man, okay?
{97089}{97152}If you're going with that property,|you're wrong, baby.
{97154}{97284}'Madonna Swaps Beatty|For Dancer 31 Years Younger.
{97285}{97374}Madonna has dumped her lover,|Warren Beatty, for a young dancer...
{97375}{97469}with the body of a Greek god|and the stamina of a super stud.
{97567}{97652}The new love in her life|is 22-year-old Oliver Crumes...
{97654}{97704}also known as Slam.
{97777}{97836}I just want to tell you that...
{97838}{97929}I don't think you're guilty|for that thing in the magazine.
{97931}{97986}I'm not worried|about the magazine.
{97988}{98044}Oliver, look.
{98046}{98124}There are always going|to be queens on the rag.
{98126}{98188}You have to expect that of me.
{98190}{98261}You got some press,|and they're jealous.
{98263}{98330}'The fact that he's black|means nothing to Madonna.
{98331}{98396}She's attracted to him,|body and heart.
{98398}{98453}But not mind.
{98455}{98551}All that matters|is your relationship with me...
{98552}{98633}and not what you do|onstage every night.
{98635}{98685}I think it's silly.
{98687}{98756}- You know it's all bullshit.|- I know.
{98758}{98815}Then why let it bother you?
{98817}{98880}I'm not letting|them guys bother me.
{98882}{98952}A lot of crazy shit|is happening right now.
{98954}{99085}Everybody's gonna have to get over|their ego and pull this group together.
{99086}{99167}Please try to rise above it, okay?
{99169}{99246}Don't let it get to you.|All right?
{99300}{99392}And please don't give me attitude,|because I won't tolerate it.
{99441}{99487}Is that it?
{99518}{99598}I understand.|I'm just asking, is that it?
{99638}{99684}Yeah, that's it.
{99724}{99780}'During auditions for|her Blond Ambition tour...
{99782}{99839}she flirted with him openly|from day one.
{99841}{99919}He wasn't the best of the hundreds|of dancers auditioning.
{99921}{99983}- That's right.|- You can say that again.
{99985}{100026}Sometimes I think...
{100028}{100090}'Oliver, can you really dance?|Should you be on this tour?'
{100092}{100178}That's the way I feel sometimes,|and it's not good.
{100180}{100222}It gets to me.
{100224}{100288}Listen, you guys,|I just want to reiterate...
{100290}{100356}this thing about Oliver|and stuff.
{100358}{100428}Please don't pick on him.|I'm not protecting him.
{100430}{100508}To tell you the truth, I haven't|said a word to him since I got here.
{100509}{100570}But he's gone.|I don't know where he is.
{100572}{100657}He's hiding. You three together|can be pretty ferocious.
{100659}{100707}So be nice to him.
{100709}{100780}He doesn't have|the thick skin that you have.
{100782}{100869}He doesn't have the survival|techniques you guys have.
{100871}{100947}And I want him to perform|in the show.
{100981}{101026}- Thank you.|- No problem.
{101027}{101097}I don't believe that you|don't remember things like that.
{101099}{101157}How could Sharon not know|what happened to her?
{101158}{101207}She thinks someone drugged her.
{101208}{101269}She said she was|at the club dancing.
{101271}{101328}The next thing she knew|was that she woke up...
{101329}{101402}in her room, nude,|and her stuff was stolen.
{101404}{101458}She went to the bathroom.|Her butt was bleeding.
{101488}{101553}I'm sorry I'm laughing.|It's so--
{101555}{101596}That's all she remembers.
{101598}{101663}She said she wasn't drinking.|She had cranberry juice.
{101665}{101703}That's all she had.
{101705}{101751}They drugged her ass.
{101753}{101809}All I can think of is|that she started talking about...
{101811}{101892}how she's on tour with me,|she's staying at the Ritz Carlton...
{101894}{102002}and those guys got it in their mind|they were going to fuck with her.
{102003}{102078}I never thought that something|like that would happen to me.
{102080}{102162}I was fine. I was normal.|I was with the--
{102164}{102230}Most victims do.|They never thought--
{102232}{102308}I never thought something like that|would happen to me.
{102310}{102385}It was a nice club.|It was really nice.
{102386}{102454}I was just dancing|with these boys.
{102456}{102520}We were just like--|Like this, and--
{102522}{102566}I was totally sober.
{102567}{102641}You can ask my friend|and these other girls I saw.
{102642}{102692}Then the next thing I know--
{102739}{102791}I wake up this morning--
{102793}{102875}I ain't never gonna go out|by myself again.
{102877}{102981}Never going out by myself again.|I'm going to stick with you guys.
{103009}{103059}It was days like that...
{103061}{103170}that I was reminded just how young|the dancers really were.
{103172}{103260}What was really strange|was that this last show in New York...
{103262}{103356}was an AIDS benefit|in memory of a friend of mine...
{103358}{103434}a really good friend of mine...
{103436}{103477}who had died--
{103479}{103545}Here I was,|getting ready to go onstage...
{103547}{103641}to supposedly convince and inspire|thousands of people...
{103643}{103738}to get unified|and to fight the prejudice...
{103740}{103776}you know, that--
{103831}{103885}I couldn't even inspire|seven dancers.
{103887}{103942}All right.
{103944}{104015}I think everybody's feeling|a lot better...
{104017}{104082}today than they were|a couple of days ago.
{104084}{104133}I'm not worried about the show.
{104135}{104222}What I am worried about|and want to say a prayer about...
{104224}{104294}is the way people|have been behaving.
{104296}{104375}I don't care what you did|with your life before this tour.
{104377}{104438}I don't care what you do|with them afterwards.
{104440}{104522}But while you're working with me|and doing this show...
{104523}{104583}you will treat everyone|in this group...
{104584}{104670}with kindness, compassion|and respect.
{104672}{104774}I don't want to hear about it anymore.|There's too much pain in the world.
{104776}{104869}I want you to treat yourselves|with kindness and respect.
{104896}{104961}A lot of crazy shit|has been happening.
{104963}{105058}We have to start|looking out for each other.
{105060}{105136}And we have to start loving ourselves|a little bit more...
{105138}{105222}and loving the person|standing next to us a little bit more.
{105224}{105315}Seeing how this is our last show|in New York...
{105317}{105365}and our last show...
{105407}{105473}in the United States...
{105475}{105545}and we are dedicating it|to Keith Haring...
{105547}{105663}who doesn't have the luxury|of being alive, like we do...
{105665}{105718}I beg You...
{105720}{105827}to let me and everybody in this room|rise above all of our problems...
{105829}{105918}and go out there|on that stage tonight...
{105920}{105991}and give the best performance|of our lives.
{105992}{106041}Do this one for Keith.
{106092}{106128}Amen.
{106182}{106253}That's all.|Everybody, have a great show.
{106518}{106562}Places, please!
{106564}{106602}Prayer's over.
{106632}{106681}Places. Have a good show.
{106714}{106772}- Why did I do that?|- That's all right.
{106774}{106825}- It's gonna be a great show.|- I hope I can sing.
{106827}{106875}I hope we all can now.
{106877}{106951}Do I have mousse in my hair?
{106953}{107057}One more time for the States?|Should we try to have a holiday?
{107059}{107095}Yeah, right.
{107097}{107141}Holiday
{107143}{107199}Celebration
{107201}{107300}Come together|in every nation
{107994}{108054}Holiday
{108094}{108129}Celebrate
{108403}{108452}If we took a holiday
{108501}{108549}Took some time to celebrate
{108605}{108654}Just one day out of life
{108656}{108703}Holiday
{108704}{108756}It would be
{108758}{108830}It would be so nice
{109010}{109061}We can turn this world around
{109118}{109224}And bring back|all of those happy days
{109252}{109343}Put your troubles down|Come on now
{109345}{109427}It's time to celebrate
{109458}{109515}Let love shine
{109550}{109607}And we will find
{109609}{109666}A way to come together
{109668}{109752}We can make things better
{109754}{109818}We need a holiday
{110250}{110287}All right, everybody!
{110318}{110366}Do the bus stop!
{110368}{110413}Oh, yeah!
{110414}{110472}Let me hear ya!
{110681}{110755}Now let me hear you scream!
{111935}{111971}You sing.
{111973}{112022}If we took a holiday
{112074}{112125}Everything would be okay
{112375}{112420}All right, everybody.
{112458}{112506}Let me hear you say 'Ho'!
{112734}{112774}All together now.
{113468}{113520}When we finally got to Europe...
{113522}{113581}there was such|an overwhelming sense of relief.
{113582}{113691}After all the tension and darkness,|Europe just felt so glamorous...
{113693}{113747}and new and exciting.
{113786}{113911}- Don't make her strike a pose.|- I've been living for Chanel.
{113913}{113999}Shopping can really|cheer a girl up.
{114034}{114130}Now, you boys better do what I say.
{114157}{114238}- Second grade teacher.|- Miss Crabtree.
{114240}{114282}Or Miss Brooks.
{114284}{114317}That's a perfect fit.
{114319}{114381}It's very|'obey everything I say.'
{114383}{114462}Yeah, it's like very|Janet Jackson, Rhythm Nation.
{114578}{114637}Bite your tongue.
{114639}{114722}Do you have any simpler earrings|than these?
{114789}{114842}They make you look beautiful.
{114844}{114900}Earrings don't make people|look beautiful.
{114927}{114983}Money makes people look beautiful.
{115041}{115115}Hello. Gautier,|listen, I told you.
{115191}{115258}Hi. Who's this? I'm fine.
{115260}{115297}Can I help you?
{115299}{115360}Would you like|anyone in particular?
{115392}{115435}What's your name?
{115437}{115483}Chanelta?
{115484}{115601}Chanelta needs a salesgirl|downstairs now.
{115638}{115676}Bye-bye. Thank you.
{115678}{115713}Bye. Thanks.
{115952}{116027}Happy birthday
{116028}{116098}Dear Melissa
{116178}{116242}Yo, Mel.|This is your birthday poem.
{116244}{116307}'Way back in the beginning...
{116309}{116376}when I started|all of my sinning...
{116378}{116446}I needed a partner in crime,|you could say...
{116448}{116529}so I went on a search|and I started to pray.
{116530}{116604}I walked into|my manager's office one morn.
{116606}{116682}I was mouthing out loud|in my usual form.
{116684}{116778}As my eyes toured the room,|my poor heart skipped a beat...
{116780}{116881}for there in the corner|was the picture of sweet.
{116979}{117095}She was glued to the phone.|She was bathed in pastels.
{117097}{117172}Her Lee press-ons were setting.
{117174}{117227}They were longer than hell.
{117289}{117362}I turned and I winked|and I said...
{117364}{117457}Hey, Miss Muffett, you think|you can work for a bitch?
{117459}{117519}Can you tough it?
{117521}{117595}I'm gagging! No way!|Get me outta this dump!
{117678}{117762}I said, Hey, Freddy,|find a new girl to pump.
{117933}{117996}So the rest is like history.|Legend, okay?
{117998}{118056}You want to hear dish?|She don't play it that way.
{118058}{118133}How can I thank you,|my sweet Melly-Mel?
{118135}{118211}You pick up my shit|and my undies that smell.
{118338}{118423}You shield me from assholes|and take all their calls.
{118425}{118511}You buy me my Tampax|and rubbers and all.
{118563}{118603}Size large.
{118694}{118801}'Now, you can't count on much|in this life. I should know.
{118803}{118876}But I guess I got lucky.|I found me a pro.
{118878}{118940}She still lives in the Valley...
{118942}{118995}but her press-ons are gone.
{119025}{119075}She still goes out with jocks...
{119077}{119134}but she sips Dom Perignon.
{119206}{119312}But without you, I'm nothing.|I'm gagging, Miss Thing.
{119314}{119401}If you ever leave me,|I'm gonna fuckin' kill myself.
{119755}{119837}Those first few weeks in Europe|were almost perfect.
{119839}{119920}It felt like|the Partridge Family world tour.
{119921}{119977}Sort of.
{119979}{120019}Congratulations!
{120021}{120070}Don't do it!|He's a tramp!
{120072}{120109}He's a slut!
{120111}{120147}Suck it.
{120192}{120242}Come in only if you're a man.
{120244}{120315}Girls, I'm here.|Mama Makeup.
{120352}{120419}Tell Jai Winding that|he doesn't come into 'Prayer.'
{120421}{120530}When I ask him to play the record,|I'm going to say--
{120635}{120730}- Voulez-vous will you kiss my dick?|- 'Will you play my record?'
{120731}{120788}One-track fucking mind, okay.
{120922}{120992}Here comes the bride
{120994}{121068}All dressed in white
{121195}{121243}Oh, that's really good.
{121286}{121334}I just pray I remember...
{121336}{121401}that I have to speak|French and English.
{121403}{121478}World tour in the year 2025.
{121480}{121544}Like a virgin
{121591}{121689}I got the moves, baby|You got the lotion
{121691}{121765}They don't even let|Zsa Zsa Gabor in this hotel.
{121767}{121840}- Why not?|- Because she's a cochonne.
{121867}{121943}Didn't know how lost I was
{121945}{122014}Until I found you
{122042}{122118}I was beat, incomplete
{122160}{122254}I was sad|I was hurt and blue
{122255}{122324}But you made me feel
{122326}{122375}The audiences have been great.
{122377}{122448}Every show just keeps getting|better and better.
{122450}{122504}So let us just have|one more great show...
{122506}{122594}where everybody kicks ass|and has a great time.
{122596}{122644}I'm fuckin' pissed, okay?
{122689}{122762}Okay, what are you|fuckin' lookin' at, huh?
{122811}{122880}When I'm pissed off,|I gotta express myself.
{122882}{122943}You know|what I'm fuckin' saying?
{123026}{123074}Sorry about that, Lenny.
{123156}{123208}Halfway through Europe,|my bubble burst.
{123210}{123284}I started hearing reports|from ltaly...
{123286}{123370}that the Vatican was trying|to ban the show.
{123401}{123479}I am an ltalian-American,|and I am proud of it...
{123481}{123529}proud of being an American...
{123531}{123592}because it is the country|I grew up in...
{123593}{123661}the country that gave me|the opportunities...
{123663}{123711}to be who I am today...
{123713}{123777}and a country that believes in|freedom of speech...
{123779}{123822}and artistic expression.
{124030}{124194}I have a tale to tell
{124241}{124328}Sometimes it gets so hard
{124330}{124412}To hide it well
{124492}{124558}I was not ready
{124560}{124631}For the fall
{124689}{124737}Too blind to see
{124739}{124840}The writing on the wall
{124912}{125005}A man can tell a thousand lies
{125007}{125088}I've learned my lesson well
{125090}{125148}I hope I live to tell
{125150}{125224}The secret I have learned
{125226}{125281}Till then
{125282}{125407}It will burn inside of me
{125514}{125613}Truth is never far behind
{125615}{125687}You've kept it hidden well
{125689}{125782}If I live to tell the secret
{125784}{125829}I knew then
{125831}{125881}Will I
{125883}{125994}Ever have the chance again
{126132}{126212}My show is not|a conventional rock show...
{126214}{126300}but a theatrical presentation|of my music.
{126302}{126348}And, like theater...
{126349}{126403}it asks questions...
{126404}{126494}provokes thoughts and takes you|on an emotional journey...
{126524}{126628}portraying good and bad,|light and dark...
{126630}{126681}joy and sorrow...
{126683}{126746}redemption and salvation.
{126748}{126823}I do not endorse a way of life...
{126825}{126867}but describe one...
{126869}{126968}and the audience is left to make|its own decisions and judgments.
{127128}{127199}This is what I consider|freedom of speech...
{127200}{127266}freedom of expression|and freedom of thought.
{127456}{127529}Every night,|before I go onstage...
{127531}{127593}I say a prayer...
{127595}{127653}not only that my show|will go well...
{127655}{127716}but that the audience|will watch...
{127717}{127799}with an open heart|and an open mind...
{127801}{127851}and see it as a celebration...
{127853}{127926}of love, life and humanity.
{128004}{128083}If I ran away
{128084}{128174}I'd never have the strength
{128175}{128233}To get very far
{128235}{128301}How could they hear
{128303}{128451}The beating of my heart
{128452}{128505}Will it grow cold
{128507}{128613}The secret that I hide
{128615}{128669}Will I grow old
{128671}{128727}How will they hear
{128728}{128781}When will they learn
{128783}{128869}How will they know
{128930}{129028}The controversy stayed with me|all through ltaly and...
{129030}{129105}eventually I had|to cancel two shows.
{129175}{129244}I got my period|suddenly early this month.
{129246}{129301}Look. This is my gym.
{129302}{129359}You want to use it?
{129361}{129425}- If you ever do, you can.|- Sandra--
{129427}{129491}Born-- Boin-- Or something.
{129526}{129619}I forgot her last name.|Sometimes I can't pronounce it.
{129621}{129694}- You know who I'm talking about.|- Try pronouncing it.
{129696}{129739}Bornhard.
{129799}{129847}Whatever her name was...
{129849}{129925}that's one of her best friends.
{129927}{130002}I had those dreams|when my mother died.
{130004}{130090}For like a five-year period after that,|that's all I dreamed about--
{130091}{130158}that people were jumping on me|and strangling me...
{130160}{130225}and I was constantly screaming|for my father...
{130227}{130286}and no sound would come out.
{130288}{130344}What happened when you woke up?|You were crying?
{130346}{130443}I'd be sweating and afraid|and have to go sleep with my father.
{130445}{130508}Was that before he got remarried?
{130510}{130575}How was that|when you slept with him?
{130577}{130662}Fine. I went right to sleep|after he fucked me. I'm just kidding.
{130664}{130710}Was he sweet to you?
{130711}{130748}Of course.
{130750}{130806}Barngard. Barnyard. Something.
{130871}{130925}Anyway, you know, she's scary.
{130960}{131055}So, I had a little fling|with another art world person.
{131057}{131106}Oh, should I guess?
{131108}{131159}An art dealer?
{131161}{131232}- A gallery owner.|- She's pretty sexy.
{131233}{131278}There's something about her.
{131279}{131353}She looks like if she was|having sex with someone...
{131354}{131443}she looks like she'd get a rope|and strap you to the bed.
{131445}{131509}Ooh, baby! Ow!
{131550}{131628}- I saw her before I left.|- Really? How unfortunate.
{131630}{131694}I'm like a drug addict,|you know?
{131696}{131763}Are you still sleeping with her?
{131765}{131830}Are you still fucking with her?
{131832}{131885}- Once in a--|- I don't like her.
{131887}{131945}I don't either.|Believe me, it's sickening.
{131947}{132010}I don't like the people|I sleep with either.
{132012}{132081}That's why you sleep with them--|'cause they're hideous.
{132155}{132231}By the time this comes out,|it won't matter anymore.
{132233}{132319}By the time this comes out,|she'll have fucked you over.
{132320}{132360}She already did.
{132410}{132514}You know, when I got to meet her|and whatever...
{132516}{132594}you know, she was pretty cool.
{132596}{132647}I'm so desperate.
{132649}{132715}- For what, honey?|- For some fun. It's all work.
{132717}{132797}- What kind of fun do you want to have?|- This is fun to me.
{132799}{132868}All I do is hang out|with everybody in the show.
{132870}{132950}- After a while, it gets boring.|- Who do you want to meet next?
{132996}{133057}Who do I want to meet next?
{133100}{133161}Who would really blow you away?
{133230}{133294}I think I've met everybody.
{133296}{133350}Just tell me one person.
{133352}{133426}That would really blow me away?
{133428}{133511}Who would really rock your world?
{133620}{133703}The guy that's in all of|Pedro Almodovar's movies.
{133705}{133757}- Antonio Bandares.|- I know him.
{133759}{133828}Antonio Bandares|was this Spanish actor...
{133830}{133901}that I've had a crush on|for two years.
{133903}{133968}He's in all of|Pedro Almodovar's movies.
{133970}{134018}I love Pedro's movies.
{134020}{134090}I've seen every movie|Antonio's ever done.
{134092}{134176}I have to say he's one of|the few actors...
{134178}{134251}that I was really dying to meet.
{134253}{134322}We get to Madrid,|and it turns out...
{134324}{134397}that Pedro wants to throw|this dinner party for me.
{134399}{134457}Of course,|Antonio's going to be there.
{134483}{134535}And so here I am.
{134537}{134643}I spend the whole week|psyching myself up for this party...
{134645}{134705}and I've got it|worked out in my head.
{134707}{134769}I'm going to make Antonio|fall madly in love with me.
{134771}{134875}Only there is this one obstacle|that I'd never counted on:
{134905}{134951}- his wife.|- You want?
{134953}{135020}I've been wanting|to meet Antonio for years.
{135021}{135094}I finally get to meet him,|and he's married.
{135096}{135172}-I am.|-That's one of life's little fuck-overs.
{135174}{135241}Don't worry. I'm just kidding.
{135243}{135287}Not.
{135288}{135377}- Oh, wow!|- This is Juan, Spanish star, too.
{135411}{135475}- Actor, singer.|- Nice to meet you. Are you married?
{135477}{135528}- Dancer.|- Are you married?
{135530}{135573}Bye! Bye-bye!
{135727}{135780}Hey, knock it off, fellas.
{135782}{135851}- What's wrong, baby?|- I've got to go drown my sorrows.
{135853}{135942}- Girl, you're ready to snatch him.|- I'm putting my head in the toilet.
{135984}{136054}Don't do it till we get home.
{136085}{136190}I said to Ricky, 'Fuck. This is|such a disaster. He's married.'
{136192}{136292}He goes, 'ln Spain it doesn't matter.|You can have whatever you want.'
{136294}{136368}- Just like in ltaly.|- Good thing I don't live here.
{136369}{136419}I would be a fighting bitch.
{136420}{136483}Is that man beautiful, or what?
{136512}{136560}There's gotta be|something wrong with him.
{136562}{136612}He probably has|a really small penis.
{136614}{136705}There's gotta be something wrong|with him. Nobody's that perfect.
{136706}{136794}I'm gonna go back in the room,|and who am I going to flirt with?
{136796}{136852}- I know who.|- That little shit.
{136854}{136903}The guy next to us.
{136905}{136955}Oh, my beautiful men.
{137029}{137090}I will sue them both. Go!
{137118}{137171}- Yes.|- You have to call me.
{137173}{137208}I'll call you.
{137209}{137272}- Tomorrow, right?|- Yes, yes, I'll call you.
{137324}{137359}Bye-bye.
{137412}{137486}Needless to say, I never saw|or heard from Antonio again.
{137513}{137590}I don't think he's such|a good actor after all.
{137592}{137648}Were there any messages?
{137650}{137707}No messages.
{137709}{137772}Madonna! Madonna!
{137964}{138053}My sleeping pill|didn't wear off yet.
{138055}{138094}So...
{138096}{138183}if I start acting like|Joey Heatherton, you'll understand.
{138472}{138564}Even when I feel like shit,|they still love me.
{138566}{138658}I think Madonna's a lot happier now|than on the last tour.
{138660}{138750}She's happy with|the effect she's had.
{138752}{138855}But I think there's a part of|her life that makes her unhappy.
{138857}{138929}I don't think|she takes enough time...
{138930}{139010}to appreciate and enjoy|her success.
{139012}{139099}She only thinks of the dance steps|she might have missed or--
{139100}{139175}Madonna does feel|more in control...
{139176}{139271}when she doesn't extend|her personal emotion...
{139273}{139367}her love, her exposure|to sensitivity too much.
{139369}{139426}Madonna's very difficult to reach.
{139427}{139480}She's put up many barriers.
{139482}{139555}I'm sure she's going through|a lot with these things...
{139557}{139638}'cause there's not many people|she can trust and get close to...
{139640}{139705}'cause I'm sure everyone|wants something from her.
{139707}{139751}She's fishing for affection.
{139753}{139861}I suppose she's fishing for people|who can be real and honest with her.
{139863}{139939}I don't really think|anybody is honest with her...
{139941}{139982}except for maybe me.
{139984}{140045}I'm certainly not honest|all the time.
{140046}{140116}We're all seeking Madonna's approval|to some degree.
{140118}{140180}Sometimes I feel like|she really trusts me...
{140182}{140271}and sometimes I feel like|she's not really looking at me.
{140272}{140383}Madonna has a hard time|connecting...
{140384}{140506}and giving herself away|to any one person.
{140508}{140627}I feel like she's--|Madonna's very in the moment.
{140629}{140692}She's very impatient.|Madonna's quite impatient.
{140694}{140753}It's just 'cause|she wants things done.
{140755}{140829}She has a lot to do.|She has a busy life.
{140831}{140895}She's definitely|in a race against time.
{140897}{140988}Everything is subject|to her approval...
{140990}{141029}or disapproval.
{141031}{141126}Everything has to do with what|she wants, what she doesn't want...
{141128}{141216}how it should look,|where it should go, what it should be.
{141218}{141253}It's very tense.
{141255}{141319}She's unhappy a lot of the time.|She's a bitch sometimes.
{141321}{141386}Madonna can be mean, if she wants to.|We all can.
{141388}{141440}A nice, relaxing morning.
{141442}{141499}- I love it when she's mean.|- She hasn't been a bitch to me.
{141500}{141579}She knows what she's doing.|She knows how to work.
{141581}{141657}That's probably why|she's such a big star.
{141659}{141777}I feel like she's a little girl|lost in a storm sometimes.
{141779}{141872}There's just like|a whole whirlwind of things...
{141874}{141926}going on around her and...
{141967}{142037}sometimes she|gets caught up in it.
{143473}{143521}Strike a pose.
{143899}{143951}Vogue, vogue, vogue

{147058}{147094}Magical

{147149}{147206}So get up on the dance floor

{153396}{153485}'Who do I think I am,|trying to pull this off?'

{153560}{153633}I can only allow myself|to think it once in a while...
{153635}{153712}because if I do, I'm gone.
{153714}{153793}And that is,|I think of you guys...

{154204}{154276}but I'm not interested in that.
{154277}{154381}I'm interested in|pushing people's buttons...
{154383}{154448}and being provocative|and political.
{154450}{154552}It doesn't matter|if you win or lose
{154553}{154651}It's how you play the game|so get into the groove

{156200}{156270}Pull the sheets up|so it looks like you're naked.
{156272}{156310}Yes, of course.
{156343}{156386}- Oh, I'm so shocked.|- Oh, my God.
{156388}{156441}I'm gagging.
{156443}{156508}- Why are you wearing your underwear?|- Why not? I'm in bed.
{156510}{156608}- Did you walk here in your underpants?|- You're acting like me.
{156610}{156671}If he doesn't sleep with--|Wait. I'm talking.
{156672}{156725}You know what that means.
{156761}{156826}I just think life is unfair.|Here I am.
{156828}{156930}Everybody thinks I have everything I|want, but I want you and can't have you.
{156932}{156982}You shouldn't have any more sex.
{156984}{157053}You should build an altar to me|in your home...
{157055}{157102}and worship it daily...
{157103}{157151}and call me collect.
{157153}{157233}- I've called him insane.|- You're the only woman I love.
{157234}{157312}You lied, Luis!|Now I'm going to beat you up.
{157314}{157380}I wouldn't hire fags|that hate women.
{157382}{157435}I kill fags that hate women.
{157437}{157506}In fact, I kill anybody|that hates women.
{157508}{157575}In fact, I'll kill anybody|that hates...
{157576}{157626}because I hate people|that hate.
{157627}{157671}Ollie, I hate you.
{157673}{157753}I hate you because you're beautiful|and you're a fuck.
{157782}{157817}I hate you.
{157819}{157868}You're sweating, and you smell!
{157911}{157959}Oh, your dick is big.
{157961}{157998}Come on.
{157999}{158079}My aunt wrote a book called Men Who|Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them.
{158081}{158149}- You should read it.|- I think I helped her write it.
{158240}{158294}- All right. You want it.|- Pupils.
{158333}{158381}Did I hurt you? Good.
{158383}{158436}Get out of my bed.
{158438}{158500}Don't come back|until your dick is bigger.
{158502}{158567}See how you|won't get away from me?
{158569}{158606}Don't leave me.
{158608}{158658}Get out now,|or I'm calling the police.
{158703}{158740}What's wrong?
{158742}{158850}- My life is really complicated.|- If I have to leave, hand me my pants.
{158852}{158896}I'd rather die!
{158923}{158998}Get out!|Get out, you bastard!
{159000}{159037}Smell them.
{159039}{159091}I'm outta here.|I'm leaving.
{159093}{159165}Oh, look.|Does anybody give a shit?
{159167}{159265}Don't ever come back.|I hate you. Next.
{159266}{159349}- I'd give you the shirt off my back.|- Take it off, girl.
{159351}{159412}Take if off!
{159476}{159545}It's not time for a feeding!|Get away!
{159588}{159661}She's been trying to feed the boys.|Feel better now?
{159663}{159700}Madonna's Vegas show.
{159702}{159788}What do we think of people|that have body parts that aren't real?
{159843}{159904}But we love you anyway, Madonna.
{159969}{160033}Honey, my titties|are the real thing.
{160035}{160096}Who said anything about titties?
{160167}{160207}You mean my hair?
{160249}{160285}Keep going.
{160287}{160342}- What's not real?|- Everything's real on you.
{160344}{160419}- They just don't think so.|- I think so.
{160421}{160488}- I'm real, you guys.|- Except for the pearls.
{160490}{160554}- They are, too, real.|- All of them?
{160556}{160604}Madonna can't afford real pearls
{160705}{160784}I can so! I'm rich.|I can have anything I want.
{160785}{160840}She sleeps with boots!
{160888}{160957}Do we want to be accepted|by Hollywood?
{161001}{161059}Do we care|what people think of us?
{161098}{161147}Do we want people|to kiss our ass?
{161191}{161229}Yeah, we do.
{161284}{161388}But do we want to have|an 'R' rating or an 'X' rating?
{161390}{161439}'X'!
{161440}{161499}'X' for extra fun!
{161755}{161846}One child grows up to be
{161876}{161938}Somebody who just loves to learn
{161940}{162063}And another child
{162065}{162129}Grows up to be
{162131}{162183}Somebody you'd just love to burn
{162245}{162304}Mom loves
{162306}{162359}The both of them
{162361}{162413}You see|it's in the blood
{162487}{162566}Both kids are good to Mom
{162596}{162655}Blood's thicker than the mud
{162657}{162752}It's a family affair
{162753}{162798}Keep people together
{162833}{162902}It's a family affair
{163273}{163314}Hi, hi, hi!
{163316}{163370}- Hello.|- Hello, love.
{163371}{163421}Well, well, well.
{163422}{163497}If it isn't my lovely family.
{163498}{163555}Aren't we just having|a lovely time?
{163557}{163605}A lovely time.
{163653}{163708}'Cause I've got something|to say to you.
{163710}{163758}Keep people together
{163759}{163837}Keep people together|forever and ever
{164183}{164244}We're a wild and crazy bunch.
{164246}{164294}Yeah, that's right.
{164296}{164386}All right, love.|Take me where I'm going.
{164387}{164476}This is what I call|traveling in style.
{164478}{164568}Yeah, that's right.|Thank you, Ollie.
{164570}{164654}All right. Formation.
{164751}{164796}I've hit the big time
{164798}{164840}But I still get the blues
{164842}{164903}Everyone's a stranger
{164905}{164953}City life can get to you
{164955}{165020}People can be so cold
{165021}{165074}Never want to turn your back
{165076}{165124}Just giving to get something
{165126}{165171}Always wanting something back
{165201}{165249}When I get lonely
{165251}{165357}And I need to be loved|for who I am
{165359}{165422}Not what they want to see
{165423}{165470}Brothers and sisters
{165472}{165526}They've always been there for me
{165528}{165577}We have a connection
{165579}{165654}Home is where the heart should be
{165656}{165762}Keep it together|in the family
{165764}{165869}They're a reminder|of your history
{165871}{165955}Brothers and sisters|they hold the key
{165956}{166010}To your heart|and your soul
{166012}{166107}Don't forget|that your family is gold
{166216}{166271}When I look back
{166273}{166334}On all the misery
{166336}{166447}And all the heartache|that they brought to me
{166449}{166559}I wouldn't change it|for another chance
{166560}{166618}'Cause blood is thicker
{166620}{166710}Than any other circumstance
{166795}{166900}All right, time for a little bit|of the old in-out, you know.
{167641}{167744}The family that plays together|stays together.
{167746}{167790}Here we go.
{169146}{169206}One!
{169208}{169262}Two! Come on, love.
{169264}{169373}One, two.|One, two, three. Hit it!
{169850}{169906}Unfortunately, Europe...
{169908}{169995}it's time for us to say bonsoir.
{170035}{170104}To all of our families.
{170106}{170160}You're my family.
{170162}{170196}Yeah, that's right.
{170223}{170271}And never forget...
{170272}{170351}that your family is your friend.
{170353}{170397}Yeah, that's right.
{170399}{170476}And never doubt|that without them...
{170478}{170535}you are nothing.
{170537}{170574}Yeah, that's right.
{170575}{170638}But most of all|and most importantly...
{170640}{170703}never doubt yourselves.
{170705}{170759}Yeah, that's right.
{170760}{170833}Come on, ladies.|On your knees.
{170965}{171005}Aren't they lovely?
{171778}{171816}It's okay.
{171847}{171881}Thanks.
{172007}{172085}- What are you thinking about?|- You.
{172375}{172424}Bye. I love you.
{172584}{172635}You're so big, Carlton.
{172637}{172686}And you're such a lady.
{172979}{173029}- Bye, baby.|- Bye, you guys.
{173085}{173146}Don't get into any catfights|on the way home.
{173994}{174044}- Ready?|- Yes, Mom.
{174046}{174110}Let's say our good night prayer.
{174112}{174148}All right.
{174150}{174229}Now I lay me down to sleep.
{174231}{174326}I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
{174328}{174417}If I should die|before I wake...
{174419}{174525}I pray the Lord|my soul to take.
{174527}{174574}God bless:
{175073}{175150}- Did I forget anyone?|- Carlton.
{175152}{175227}- That's right.|- He's an adopted child.
{175257}{175321}- It's time to say good night.|- Am I adopted?
{175323}{175388}Time to say good night, everybody.
{175390}{175438}I want some ice cream.
{175440}{175514}- I want some vanilla ice cream.|- Shut up, Carlton.
{175516}{175563}Close your eyes.
{175564}{175608}Dream some dreams.
{175878}{175932}I gotta pee.
{175934}{175991}Just pee in bed.
{175993}{176050}- You know what he's doing?|- Not on me.
{176052}{176104}Don't say anything.
{176106}{176156}Good night, boys and girls.
{176158}{176229}Good night, Madonna.

{176416}{176461}Good night, Lou.
{176675}{176712}Who farted?
{176743}{176825}Shut up! Shut up|and go to sleep!
{176827}{176871}She smelled it.
{176873}{176951}She smelled it,|and she dealt it.
{176952}{176995}You stinky.|You stinker.
{176997}{177050}Somebody farted boots.
{177052}{177111}Somebody farted!
{177113}{177162}Nuclear testing!
{177164}{177199}Oh, gross.
{177236}{177301}I smell boots!
{177303}{177343}We're smelling boots!
{177415}{177474}I think I got my period.
{177505}{177576}You guys. Shut up!
{177616}{177686}Ow! She hurt me!
{177688}{177730}Sleepy time.
{178019}{178063}I said shut up!
{178594}{178663}I'm going to press this thing.|I'm going to press power.

That's my sister
Skylar and her boyfriend Holden.
And that's me.
Well, I'm Djuna. D-J-U-N-A.
Oh, and everyone calls me D.J.
Now, I'm gonna level with ya.
We are not the typical kind of family you'd find in a musical comedy.
For one thing, we got dough.
And we live right here on Park Avenue in a big apartment; a penthouse.
Dad's a lawyer. I mean, I call him
"Dad," but actually he's stepdad.
There's original Dad who married Mom and they had me.
And there's stepdad. Well, he had two kids with his first wife when...
Look, maybe this is all getting a little confusing.
You see, there's Lane and Laura.
Those are my half-sisters, and they're really great.
A little twitty at times, but we love each other... and we have a million laughs together.
And, of course, my stepbrother
Scott, who's very smart... but currently on the outs with the family... because he's become a conservative Republican... which has caused my stepfather to have a stroke... since we're all liberal Democrats.
How can you expect people on welfare... to develop any sort of incentives if they're getting handouts?
What are you saying? Somebody who can't work for one reason or another has to be discarded?
Welfare does not work. It's the same outmoded liberal fantasy world... as affirmative action, not allowing school prayer and coddling of criminals.
I can't believe I'm having this conversation with my own flesh and blood.
Unless some large Republican pea pods are in the basement and have taken over your body.
Not pods, Dad. Ideas.
Virile, modern ideas.
A strong America.
The right to bear arms.
- Arms? What are you... Guns?
- Yes!
Are you crazy? What the hell is the matter with you? I don't understand you anymore.
- Why... Wait a minute. Excuse me.
- Relax, Bob.
Steffi, bring down a copy of my will and an eraser, okay?
If Dad's a liberal Democrat, then you'd have to say Mom is the one thing more extreme.
She's a guilty liberal Democrat.
Well, he grew up poor and he knows what it is to work like a dog.
But Mom came from money and luxury... and, you know, spends all her time doing volunteer work for everybody.
She's with the American Civil Liberties
Union and Save the Whales... and she raises dough for the
Whitney Museum and Lenox Hill Hospital.
She's always got something going, like throwing some chic soiree to help the New York Philharmonic.
Lane and Laura go to Nightingale, which is this ritzy school on East 92nd Street.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, there he is.
- He is so gorgeous.
- Who is he?
We don't know, but we always see him around this neighborhood.
- She's in love from afar. - I'm sure we can think of a way to get her to meet him.
Please, no humiliating schemes.
You guys, my mom is in there with a patient.
Claire's their best friend.
Her mom's a shrink on Central Park West.
Years ago, Claire drilled a secret hole in the wall, and we get our kicks after school sometimes kinda tuning in on her clientele.
I've been having these fantasies about... other men, and, uh... you know, it makes me feel bad and, um, you know, guilty.
Oh, I ha... Um, I had that elevator dream... again.
And, um, I'm in the elevator... and... it just keeps going up... and up and up.
Now you have to meet Grandpa.
Eighty-eight years old.
Found him at Grand Central Station.
- He thought he was at the Botanical Gardens. - Thanks.
You have to keep your eye on him.
Last year he wandered out of the bathroom in a towel... and got on line in Times Square.
We had to send Frieda to get him back.
Oh, she's our maid.
Personally, I think she was
Hitler's maid at Berchtesgaden, but she's the only one who can handle Grandpa.
I found your arch supports in the stew!
Whatever were they doing in the stew?
Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Frieda.
Finally, there's my dad, who lives in Paris but visits a lot.
You see, he and my stepdad are great friends.
And if you ask me, he still has a crush on
Mom, although they've been divorced for years.
They're all friends, though, and they come to each other with problems.
I can't believe it.
Giselle left me.
Look at this face. She left me with my best friend, suddenly, out of left field.
- She didn't give any warning?
- Nothing at all. Look at that.
Did you ever see anything... I'm so distraught over this, I can't tell you.
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Ohhh.
I should go to Paris and jump off the Eiffel Tower. I'll be dead.
In fact, if I get the Concorde,
I could be dead three hours earlier, which would be perfect.
Or... Wait a minute.
With the time change,
I could be alive for six hours in
New York, but dead three hours in Paris.
- Sit down. Relax. - I could get things done and I could also be dead.
You didn't hear the signs.
She must've given you some signs, Joe.
What do you think I am, an idiot? What kind of signs you think she gave me?
I found this photo in her underwear drawer?
She muttered his name when making love?
- I'm not talking about that.
- No, that's what happened.
- What? Joe! - I didn't see it.
I couldn't put it together.
I'm really glad you didn't marry her.
I told you, don't do it.
- I would've been happy to marry her.
- I'm really glad.
You want a glass of something?
Some wine?
I'll take anything. I gotta have a drink. Know what the sad part is?
- I thought everything was going well.
- You always pick the wrong women.
- Hey, I picked you.
- Yeah, we got divorced.
- 'Cause you were impossible to live with.
- I was impossible to live with?
I love this. You couldn't figure out whether you wanted to be... a psychoanalyst or a writer.
So, I compromised.
I became a writer and a patient.
We're gonna find you somebody.
We... We know a lot of people.
- Can't we find somebody?
- I've been trying since we got divorced... to find the right woman for him, somebody to match up with his personality.
But I'm beginning...
Honey, bring another glass.
I'm beginning to wonder if the world population of women isn't too limited.
- Thank you.
- Well, I mean...
- You've had really bad luck. - No, he hasn't.
He's had an unerring sense of poor choice.
And the question is, does he want to spend his golden years with somebody or not?
- What, are you into my golden years suddenly? - Yes.
- You have to think about those things.
- Men age differently than women.
- Two more years, I'm gonna look like your son. - Oh, that was so mean.
Don't you laugh.
Don't talk about my golden years.
She's got me in a home already.
What about Madeline?
After me.
Madeline was won... Madeline was an archaeologist. She was fabulous.
Madeline was a nymphomaniac.
Yeah, okay, she had a little problem with fidelity.
- I didn't happen to see it. But she was a brilliant woman. - What about Carol?
Remember Carol what's-her-name?
- Carol was a poet, and a member of MENSA.
- She was a heroin addict.
She was also a heroin addict, but I thought it was insulin.
- You know what the problem is? Listen.
- This is the problem.
- He's still in love with you.
I've always said this. - Oh, honey.
Who can blame him?
Of course he is.
- Ah, come here. Come here, my two men.
- That's the problem.
Two men.
I'm pining after Giselle.
We're gonna get somebody who's nearly normal.
I don't know if we're gonna get somebody. This is the problem.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey. What's all the secrecy about?
Why Harry Winstons?
Listen... I want you to help me pick out an engagement ring for Skylar.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
So, you're looking for an engagement ring?
We're getting married.
Uh, I'm getting married.
Not to her.
Now, what size did you have in mind?
- What size?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, um... Well, she's not huge.
I mean, she's not bony either.
She's got flesh.
Something simple, but elegant?
- That's it.
- Simple, but elegant. Exactly.
- Like this one. - Oh, my God, that's beautiful. That is beautiful.
- Look at that. - That's the mos beautiful thing I ever saw. Hello.
So, what is that gonna cost me?
I like it.
- Fifty-five thousand.
- Fifty-five thousand dollars, you say?
Uh, well, let me take this off then because...
I don't think that...
Actually, as I look at it, it's really...
To Skylar's taste, it's kind of... tacky. She's not a mafia bride.
- Will you help me out?
- Here's a lovely one.
- That is... That is pretty.
- Pretty simple.
Well, I don't...
What is that gonna cost me?
About fifteen-hundred, 2,000?
- Eight thousand.
- Eight thousand dollars.
- Um...
- It's more in the ball park.
- It's in the range.
- It's the right neighborhood.
- Not my neighborhood, but...
- But it's a better neighborhood.
What the hell. Right? 'Cause we're getting married. Let's do it.
- It's pretty.
- I think it's an absolutely exquisite ring.

Mrs. Holden Spence.
Skylar Spence!
I love the sound of that.
- He's taking her to Le Cirque for dinner tonight. - Le Cirque? No kidding.
- He's gonna propose.
- I don't wanna blow my own horn here,
- but I'm the one who introduced them.
- We've heard it.
I did!
He came to work at our law firm...
The first day he was there,
I said, " This kid is great!
His feet are on the ground.
He's perfect for her."
Frieda, the pasta has no sauce.
It's Bavarian pasta! It doesn't need any sauce! Italian pasta needs sauce.
- The Italians were weak!
- Okay, fine. Just gimme some pepper.
I cannot understand you!
Your solution to rampant crime is let criminals go free?
- No, Charles Ferry deserves a parole. - What? What is this?
Are you kidding me? You want somebody like this out on the streets?
"Armed robbery, assault, assault with a deadly weapon, attempted escape."
- Scott, he was an abused child.
- Have a little compassion.
He went to prison his whole entire life because he had a horrible childhood, which is something you know nothing about.
- Then one mistake after the other.
- One mistake?
Yes. It leads to bad crime, corrupt...
I don't wanna discuss this with you.
- I can't listen to any of this!
- I can't stand this.
- I need my wallet.
- Where are you going?
- Up to the Polo Grounds.
- No, no, no.
- Giants and Cardinals are having a doubleheader. - Pop, you can't go out.
- If you wanna take a walk, you gotta go with Frieda. - Good idea.
- But they're playing today. This is
Labor Day. - It's June, Grandpa.
- It's June.
- The Polo Grounds closed years ago.
- Frieda, just take him for a short walk.
- Rained out?
- I'm not going with Frieda.
- All right, okay.
- I'm not going with her. I don't need a German shepherd. - Take a nice walk.
- You know what the kids tell me?
- German shepherd. I feel so...
They think that Holden is gonna give a little surprise to Skylar tonight.
If you keep gossiping about it, there's gonna be no surprise.
- Honey, please...
- I'm going out.
- Have a nice time. - If Minnie calls, tell her I went to the Polo Grounds.
Minnie's been dead for 20 years, Grandpa.
I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying if she calls, I'll be home later.
You know,
21 is too young to get married, but if this was anybody but Holden,
I'd be against it.
Well, there's no way I'm getting married
'til I'm 35 and I've lived,
...and then I'll probably move in with a woman. - Why do you make these jokes?
- You like Holden, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
The problem isn't Holden, it's Skylar.
She's a romantic twit.
- Yeah. Her problem with Holden is he's not romantic. - So what?
- She's gonna marry him, right? -
I hope so. I want her room when she does.
I'm serious. I don't see any reason why he should not leap at this guy.
Skylar suffers from
"white knight" syndrome.
Ever since her hormones kicked in, she's been waiting for some charismatic figure... to come and sweep her off her feet.
So Holden is that young Lochinvar.
- He's that young schnook. - He's a schnook, but he's a loveable schnook.
- He's wonderful, and you... - What an embarrassment. I'm never bringing a guy home.
- You have to listen.
- In the first place...

- I've been thinking. Can I tell you how I see us? - How?
Okay, well, we get married... and we live near my parents in Sharon.
Oh, I could never leave New York.
We leave my parents in Sharon.
We'd live in New York, of course.
It's just, at some point, we may want a little more space if we have four kids.
I want two children.
Two kids is... Two is perfect!
Two is... Two is perfect for me.
Because four is really a lot.
And you'll be able to stay at home with them and...
No, I'll be working.
I mean, when not working full-time.
Of course, you're gonna have a career: journalism.
Architecture.
Architecture? Since when?
I don't know.
It's just some thoughts I've had.
Thoughts you...
You majored in journalism, but...
The point is...
The important thing is...
I think we agree with each other on just about everything.
Shall I bring the dessert, sir?
Oh, is... It's time for dessert.
Yes, it is.
Will you excuse me for one second?
I'll just attend to a small matter.
- It's ready just as you wished, Mr. Spence.
- You think it's gonna work?
- Here we are, sir.
- Oh, look at... That's... That's perfect.
- I'm glad you liked it.
- Now, let me show you my end of the deal.
- Whoo! That's a honey, huh?
- Oh-ho. Oh, yes.
Look at that.
It set me back just a little bit.
It's a brilliant idea, sir.
Very romantic.
- Yes, well, that's the kind of guy I am.
- Oh, I can see that.
I'm just gonna lay that right down there.
- Is that gonna knock her socks off?
I think so. - Yes, sir. Shall we?
- I'm relying on you, Umberto.
- Good luck, sir.
Is everything okay?
- All taken care of.
- Shall we order dessert?
- I took the liberty.
- You did?
I know you like a take-charge kind of guy and I'm comin' through for you.
- It's not like you.
- Anything for you.
- Umberto, will you please do the honors?
- Parfait!
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, mmm!
Oh, my God, it's delicious!
And peach, my favorite flavor.
- It's delicious.
- What are you doing? Stop it!
- What are you doing?
- Where's the rest of the dessert?
- What do you mean? - Where the whipped cream and the cherry are.
- I ate it.
- You ate the ring?
- What ring?
- Honey, I bought you a diamond ring!
- You did?
- I went to Harry Winston's.
- Where is it?
- I put it in the parfait.
- Why?
- I thought it would be romantic!
You thought it would be romantic to put a ring on ice cream?
- This was not my idea.
This was D.J.'s idea! - D.J.?
She said it would give it dramatic flair. I don't believe this.
I ate a diamond ring?
I turn around for two seconds and there's $8,000 going down your throat.
- I swallowed a... Oh, my God!
- Take it easy. Stay calm.
- How big was it?
- It was tasteful, believe me.
- It was a big rock.
- I swallowed a what? A karat?
- It was a karat and a half, easily.
- You'd like two carrots?
- I'm dying!
- You're not dying!
- Something wrong, sir? - She just swallowed a little jewelry. It's all right.
- How could you?
- How could I?
- Most people look at their food before they lunge into it. -
Let me check your mouth.
I don't think this is going to present much of a problem.
It's lodged in an accessible place.
It's an absolutely beautiful ring!
A solitaire.
A classic. A brilliant choice.
Congratulations.
Oh, congratulations, girl.
It is beautiful.
Katie! Katie, look.
She got engaged.
- So, uh, what is it, about two karats?
- No, a karat and a half.
- White gold?
- No, it's solid platinum.
- Solid?
- Harry Winston's.
- What'd you pay?
- Eight thousand.
I can get this same ring for you for six from my brother-in-law.
I am so happy for you!
He is a wonderful man.
Yeah. Am I gonna scar?

Summer came and Lane and
Laura got jobs at the Metropolitan Museum... and spent weekends at the beach.
Mom put together a group of artists and writers... to petition for the parole of Charles Ferry, her new pet cause.
She even visited the prison and was just appalled by the conditions.
What we need are open prisons.
Space. Space where the damaged human spirit can heal.
I say give them an opportunity to participate... in decorating their own cells with their own personal decorators.
And better cuisine.
European menus.
As for me, well, over the years I was used to splitting summers up;
July with Mom in New York and August with Dad in Europe.
Usually it was Paris, but this time he took me to Venice.
Well, I think he still wanted to get over memories of Giselle dumping him.
Well, all I can say is, if we're gonna talk about romantic cities...
I mean, they've got the most gorgeous guys there... and they can't keep their hands off you.
It's great. The whole first week was just heaven for me.
I was just having a ball, sailing around on gondolas.
But Dad, well, he just seemed to hang around the hotel.
Giselle was still haunting him.

I just feel so guilty.
I mean, I'm having all the luck.
- You should have fun.
- I am.
I still can't figure out what went wrong with Giselle.
You know, I always thought she was a little flighty.
- You want a drink? I'm gonna have a beer.
- Yeah. A Bellini.
- Let me give you this advice.
- Mm-hmm.
In life, when a relationship breaks up that you're in... I hope they don't...
- Thank you. - It's better to be the leaver than the "leavee."
'Cause the leaver leaves, but the "leavee" is left, and it's terrible.
The worst that happens to the leaver is a little survivor guilt, and survivor guilt is the worst thing that should ever happen to you.
Yeah? Well, tomorrow
I'll spend with you.
- It's not necessary, really.
- No, it's okay.
Don't turn around. That's the couple.
Don't turn around.
- Who? - I told you about her.
I watched her check in the other day.
She's really lovely, but I think married.
- Isn't she...
- Oh, my God!
- She's beautiful, right?
- I know who she is.
You're kidding?
Why didn't I think of it?
She's perfect for you.
How could she be perfect for me?
She's married.
No, she's not happily married.
You'd love her.
Tell me, who is she?
How do you know her?
My friend's mother is her shrink.
I know everything about her.
- You're kidding. What's her name?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
Stop teasing me. - I'm serious.
- Who is she? - She's an art historian and she's here to see the Tintorettos.
- Yeah?
- You know what I'm thinking?
- You got that look on your face.
- This is perfect.
- She jogs every morning alone.
- Yeah?
You could go and bump into her and meet her.
No, thank you.
She's a married woman.
I'm telling you, she's not happily married.
- Mm-hmm? - Complete mismatch. The guy's some actor.
Anyway, it won't interfere tomorrow because he sleeps late, so you'll have no problem.
You can meet her. She'll definitely be alone. I know this for a fact.
It's perfect.
I'm out of shape.
I can't jog. I can't do it.
I haven't touched my treadmill in weeks... 572 weeks. That's 11 years.
- I wheeze. Stop looking at me like that.
- No.
- I'm not gonna do this.
- We're gonna get you some jogging clothes.
- She is really something.
- Tomorrow morning... you're gonna jog.
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you all right?
- Yeah. - You don't happen to know which way the Gritti is?
Uh... I think it's back that way.
- Over there?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause jogging in Venice, everything is so serpen... - Labyrinthine.
- Labyrinthine!
- Yes. You okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
You gotta keep in shape.
I jog every day. You?
- Yes, I do.
- You an American?
- I... Yeah.
- It's a great country, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.
- The mountains and the prairies.
- Oh, Amer... Yeah, America. - The oceans, you know, white with foam and everything.
So...
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yes.
- Sit down.
- No, I'm okay.
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?
I have a pain in my chest that's radiating down my arm.
- That's your heart. - No. In my case, it's stress. I get it every other day.
- Okay. Breathe.
- What is your name?
- Von! Oh, here you are.
- Hi.
I was just giving him directions. Are you okay?
- Okay. You said you wanted to do three miles. Come on. - You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Breathe, breathe.
Nice shoes.
First I nearly drop dead. I couldn't breathe.
Then her husband showed up.
Her husband did come, huh? That's rare.
Rare? So is a coronary thrombosis in our family.
Oh, did you get her name?
Von. Vonnie.
Listen, she's passionate about Tintoretto.
She's working on a book about him.
Obviously she's here to visit the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.
I don't know what all this means.
What are all these art books?
She'll be at the Scuola. He won't. They have nothing in common.
You bump into her again. Now the groundwork's been laid.
You say, " Hello.
Didn't we meet jogging?"
I was the guy who had the sudden stroke.
Then you impress her with your knowledge of her favorite painter.
Hey, you gotta be kidding. My knowledge of art is limited... to Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh.
- What the hell do I know about this?
- Trust me, Dad.
Before we leave Venice, your lips will be pressed to hers.
Yes. Unfortunately, I left my Chapstick in New York.
What is this? "The rapidity of his brush strokes..."
"Chiaroscuro outbursts of color..."
I told Dad everything I knew about Von... and he studied his Tintoretto book.
I told him her likes, her dislikes, her deepest feelings, everything from her passion for Bora
Bora and "Mahler's Fourth Symphony"... to her favorite flower: the African daisy.
I mean, it was everything.
When he showed up at the
Tintoretto Museum that afternoon, he could've given a course on the subject.
- Hello again.
- Hi. Goodness.
You lived. How are you? I was concerned.
Oh, no, I was fine. I just went back to the hotel before... and had the concierge... oil my pacemaker.
- - You know, I...
Incidentally, my name is Joe Berlin.
Vonnie Sydell.
It's a funny coincidence I see you here.
You know, two New Yorkers jogging in
Venice and we bump into each other.
- How did you know I was a New Yorker?
- No, I didn't.
But, you know, I, like, assumed that, you know...
You're completely correct to ask that question.
It's a good question. You should not be ashamed of it.
Well, I live on 84th and Riverside.
Where in New York do you live?
In Paris. Well, I-I was a New
Yorker, but now I settled in Paris.
But I come back to New York all the time 'cause I love it there.
What brings you here?
Oh, I wouldn't think of being in Venice without checking out the Tintorettos, because he was... he's my favorite... master in the world.
I just adore his work.
I'm crazy about it.
He was a very deep genius.
The deepest. Th-The rapidity of his brush work.
Th-The chiaroscuro... outbursts of color.
His capacity for controlled gesture.
Born in 1519, only to die again in 1594, but that's... the way it happens to most of us.
So you have a real appreciation of his work.
How could I not have an appreciation of a man who was short in stature... but with a proud and obstinate nature, who painted outside the, the academic convention... of 16th century Venice?
What do you do, Mr. Berlin?
You can call me Joe. I'm-I'm-I'm a writer. Novelist, mostly.
Joe Berlin. I saw one of your books.
I did. I remember it.
It had a very sexy cover.
It was at the stalls on
Fifth Avenue, the 99-cent bin.
Well, you know, probably... the get-acquainted price.
- Oh.
- They'll do that sometimes.
In the United States, I'm considered controversial, but in Paris, where they have an ear for literature, I...
You know, they were quick to recognize the genius... of Poe and Faulkner and myself.
Well, basically, you see, I'm a simple guy.
My idea is just to live in
Paris and maybe, you know, fall in love and... and take walks, uh, in the rain... and-and, uh, listen to music, like, uh, particularly, maybe "Mahler's Fourth."
- This could be me talking. "Mahler's
Fourth" destroys me. - Could it?
Ah, yes, "Mahler's Fourth," no question.
I... I... See, I'm not... I'm not a, uh... what you'd call a, uh, uh, a technology guy.
- I hate technology.
- I know. I could tell by looking at you.
I-I-I, uh... I'm...
I still work on... one of those old-fashioned antique portable typewriters that-that...
Are you telling me you haven't succumbed to the cerebral computer age?
You know, I'm telling you, I like the simple life.
I like to sit in my room in Paris and write, maybe visit New York a certain amount in the summertime.
Maybe spend some time some place romantic, like, um, Bora Bora.
I... I love Bora Bora.
Since the first time I went there,
I can't get it out of my mind.
Well, naturally. You know, it's beautiful.
At night, the stars are so luminous you can practically...
- Read by them.
- read by them.
Yes. Are you okay?
A little mist appeared in your eye then.
I thought you were gonna cry. I swear, I thought you were gonna cry.
No, I'm, uh... I'm okay.
- Are you sure? Is something wrong?
- No, um...
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
Something's so exactly right.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
Wait here one second.
I'll be right back.

You know, what are you doing tonight?
I think Greg and I have plans.
Hey, how'd it go?
She was absolutely great. Whatever you told me was right on the money.
- I feel guilty.
- Why?
Because, you know, I made her cry.
She said that she felt close to me.
So? You've established a beachhead.
Now you go on and win the battle.
Don't forget to blow on her back between her shoulder blades. It makes her crazy.
Hey, I'm not gonna do that.
What goes on between her and her shrink is private.
What are you gonna do, give me a map of her erogenous zones?
- Dad, are you seeing her tonight?
- No, she's married!
Listen, I'm not that guy. I don't know Bora Bora from Walla Walla.
What the hell do I know about Tintoretto?
I can't tell the difference between his chiaroscuro and his segretto sauce.
Don't forget to blow between her shoulder blades.
I'm not gonna blow between her shoulder blades.
Plus, I use a word processor, not a typewriter.
I hope you have something great to wear tonight, 'cause we're going to a party.
A party? I...
I wanna introduce you to someone.
Dad.
This is Alberto.
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.
Who are all these people? This is, uh...
- Venetians. Friends, guests in town.
- Yes?
Did your enjoy your staying in Venice?
Fabulous. It's the best. Absolutely the best. She'll tell you.
Dad, I wanted you to meet Alberto because
I think you should be the first to know:
We're getting married.
Wonderful. Let me know what century, I'll rent a tux.
This January.
- Pardon me?
- This January.
This January.
You're joking, of course.
I am in love with Djuna.
We all love this little girl because she's adorable.
But... But you are... This is a jest.
It is January 15, to be exact.
It's his mother's birthday.
- A joke. A jest, right? Am I right?
- Not at all.
Excuse... Excuse me one second. Come on.
I just wanna talk to you for a minute. Come over here. Just for a second. Right here.
What are you talking about?
Tell me this is a joke.
Otherwise, there's gonna be carnage.
We're crazy about each other.
How can you be crazy... You met this guy... five days ago.
- So? - What do you mean, so?
Are you having a breakdown?
Why, because I'm in love?
What do you mean, you're in love? With what? What does he do?
- He's a gondolier.
- A... No, thank you.
- He's one of those guys with the striped shirt and the hat? - No hat.
- What do you mean, no hat?
- He doesn't wear a hat.
This is crazy. What are you, you know... Talk to me.
- Are you gonna... Are you talking about getting married? - Yes.
- That's insanity.
- Why is it insanity?
Because you have to go to school.
You're gonna go back to Columbia.
You're gonna major in journalism or law, not... not rowing.
People have dropped out of
Columbia before. It's been done.
You are not going to run off with a guy... who you just met and who's a gondolier.
- He's a poet.
- He's a poet?
Let me tell you what rhymes with gondolier: no lira.
- Okay? So, forget it.
- Oh, God, Dad.
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello, again.
- My God, what a coincidence.
- This is, uh... Joe, Greg.
- Hi. How do you do?
- Hi.
- Were you... You were running this morning... with the heart? - That was me.
Have you seen Bernardo
Bertolucci? Is he here?
I wouldn't recognize him
'cause it's a madhouse in there.
- Do you mind if I go ahead? If you want to talk. Okay. - It's an absolute madhouse.
I'll get you a drink.
- Incredible. I mean...
- Is it?
Have you seen this place? I was just going home. It's unbelievable.
- They have a... The whole thing is like it's an old palazzo. - Oh, wow.
And it's really, really beautiful.
But, you know, frantic in there.
- Hey, you look great.
- Oh.
I wish you wouldn't say things like that.
- Why?
- I don't know. I can't take a compliment.
You look terrific. Why not? I'm sorry.
No, it's my problem.
- Why? Does it make you feel guilty?
- Uh, maybe. I don't know.
You seem to have all the answers, don't you?
I think it makes you feel guilty.
I think that you must have fantasies of maybe somebody coming along that...
You probably have dreams about boats... or... ships, maybe, or maybe even, you know, like an elevator that...
You're on an elevator and it goes higher and higher to the top floor... and then it doesn't stop at the top, it just goes right through the roof... and it just sort of flies you over the ocean.
I think I'm gonna faint. I do.
- Are you okay?
- Uh, uh, no.
I'm... I'm a little overwhelmed... and I'm glad you're leaving tomorrow.
The next morning, we left Venice.
Dad made a flight to Paris and I went to New York.
I couldn't wait to tell
Mom about marrying Alberto.
He was so beautiful, so sensitive.
My plan was to drop out of Columbia after the fall term and move to Italy.
- Uh, excuse me. That's mine.
- No, it's...
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's not mine.
- It's okay. We both like shopping at Hunting World. - That's where I got it.
- Oh, God, now I know it's mine.
- It's all right. I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.
- Um... your bra.
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Underwear.
Petrarch's sonnets. What do you do?
Um, depends who the guy is. No, just kidding.
Um, I actua... 'Cause I work for the Colombian drug cartel.
- Yeah, I gift wrap the cocaine. - Mm-hmm.
Why am I so nervous? I'm a student at Columbia.
- Oh, is that right? My uncle teaches there.
- No.
Yeah. Math Department.
I'm, uh, Ken Grisley.
Djuna Berlin.
Did I really want to spend my life making pasta... and riding around in gondolas?
To tell you the truth, those canals are awfully polluted.
I mean, Alberto was cute, but Ken was... hot.

While I'd been away, an awful lot had happened.
Mom bought Skylar a drop-dead wedding dress, and Holden's father and my stepdad became friends.
They discovered a common interest: horse racing.
So, they chipped in and bought a thoroughbred.
And Lane and Laura had a great time at the beach.
But one hot summer weekend, with everyone else in New York away, they found themselves in town.
- So, we're probably the only ones left in the city this weekend. - Yeah.
We usually go to South Hampton, but this weekend we had tickets to a show.
I love the city when it's empty.
- Me too.
- Me too.
To make a long story short, they've all become close.
His name... if you can believe it... is Jeffrey Vandermost, and he's heir to the
Vandermost millions.
Meanwhile, they're both in love with him, and one of them's heading for a broken heart.
Fall was particularly beautiful this year.
I think I like it even better than spring, and with October comes Mom's birthday.
This year we invited Holden's parents over to celebrate, but just before they arrived we had an unexpected visitor.
That's a gorgeous color.
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.
- These are from your ex-husband, my biological father. - Oh! Joe!
- Oh, look, everybody!
- You know what that is? That's caviar.
Frieda, could you put this on ice? Nothing like sturgeon eggs.
- Are you expecting Mr. Ferry?
- I am, yes.
- You are?
- Charles Ferry?
He just got out of prison. He has no family. I figured, you know...
- So he can join our family?
- What?
- You're letting a criminal come into this house? - He's paid his debt to society.
Don't start. I don't wanna hear this.
No! Society forgave him his debts.
He did not pay his debt to society.
How did I wind up with a kid on the other end of the political spectrum from me?
- Where did I fail?
- You didn't fail, Dad.
- If I was you, I'd start hiding the silverware. - Don't be rude, Scott.
He's coming over for just a drink.
You guys have everything.
Mr. Ferry, hi. I'm... I'm Bob
Dandridge. This is my wife Steffi.
Hello, Mr. Ferry. Welcome to our home. Welcome.
I'd like you to meet my daughter Skylar.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- This is Skylar and her fiance Holden.
I'm... I'm the fiance.
- Uh, can I get you something to dr...
- Nobody gets behind me.
Right. Okay. Sure.
- Uh, can I get you something to drink?
- Uh, vodka.
Right. Maybe, uh, on the... Uh, or, or...
- Maybe right in the arm.
- Just... Just...
I'll, I'll get you a... Straight up.
Honey, Mr. Perr... Mr. Ferry. Sorry.
Uh, he's been living amongst vicious killers. No wonder he's skittish.
- A lot of times a guy'll come up behind ya and... Swish! - "Swish"?
You get your blade out quick, you stick it in him, or you're dead.
- Ahh.
- The blade. The blade.
H-Have you stuck a lot of other inmates, Mr. Ferry?
Enough.
- Uh, the d... the doorbell.
- That's enough for me.
- How many is "enough"?
- How is that?
- Would you like another one?
- Oh, it's your parents.
- Hi! Hello. How are you?
- Ohh!
- Good to see you, dear.
- Hi, Arnold.
- Happy birthday, Steffi.
- Oh, thank you, Lynn. Thanks for coming.
Hi, Arnold. I have someone I want you to meet.
Mr. Ferry. Mr. Ferry. I'd like you to meet Mr. Ferry.
This is my good friend Lynn.
- And this is Arnold.
- I must say...
- Mr. Ferry is just out of prison.
- Yes, I'm aware.
I'm lucky the parole came through, but
I was gonna get out one way or the other.
- What exactly does that mean?
- Ice the guard.
- No pictures, sister.
- I'm sorry.
What do you mean, "ice the guard"?
- Get out through the ventilation shaft.
- Ice. Really?
Come up behind him with a box cutter, rip out his carotid artery.
- Oh.
- What's a box cutter?
- May I have a glass of white wine?
- We have white wine.
You gotta be careful, though.
Guy on cell block four tried it, didn't have all the angles figured.
- Got his tit caught in the wringer.
- His tit? Really?
- Oh, uh, the terrace.
- Let's go up to the terrace.
- Good idea. Let's get some wine. - Big, wide-open spaces.
Are you sure this guy is rehabilitated?
Honey, he was in prison, not a finishing school.
Well, you know my sentiments, but very happy birthday.

Okay? Honey.
- I'm gonna grab a few drinks.
You want anything? - No, thanks.
But before you do, would you get Steffi's present for me? I left it in the car.
- Oh, yeah.
- Holden, here.
Are you enjoying the view?
I like any view after years and years in that stinkin' rat hole.
Oh. That's very vividly put.
S-Sweetly honest.
You know what it's like in solitary confinement?
No, I can't say that I do.
I went to N.Y.U. I didn't even stay in the dorm.
- You know how long it is since I smelled perfume? - Oh, do I have too much on?
No, to me you smell like what
I think heaven would smell like.
Oh. Well, thank you. That's really nice.
When you shook my hand before, I thought my heart was gonna stop.
Oh, that's sweet.
Uh, but remember, you've been very deprived of female contact.
I used to lie in my cell at night and dream of somebody like you.
Yeah.
Oh, uh, I took, um, a criminology class in college.
- A very insight...
- You have very sensual lips.
Oh. O-Oh, well, i-it's a part of me I rarely think of.
- Can I smell your hair?
- You wanna smell my hair?
Okay. You know what? It's gonna be all gone soon.
I was thinking of cutting it. I think Holden might like it short.
You know what I would do if you were my girl?
It's a little chilly outside.
- Maybe I should get a shawl. - I would make love to you in every room in the house.
On every bed.
On every rug.
On every tabletop.
We also have some lovely early American chandeliers.
Let's go for a drive.
Um, no. I don't think that that would be such a good idea.
I haven't seen the ocean or been up to Harlem or Chinatown in years.
Oh, no, i-it's out of the question.
- Okay, but you can't blame me for tryin'.
- No.
I think that we should get back inside before...
Before what?
Before you break your parole.
If I took you in my arms and kissed you right now, would you dime on me?
- "Dime"?
- Turn me in.
Oh. Let's not find out.
Mmm.
How was it?
Uh...
Very interesting.
I've never been kissed by a sociopath before.
I kissed you the best I could, considering the only practice I had kissing in the last 10 years... is with Vincent "The Thumb" Adatto.
Jeez.
Vincent "The Thumb" doesn't know what he's missing.
Can I see you again?
Well...
You know, I'm getting married.

- Oh, wow. I can't believe this.
- Shut up, for once.
He's en route to New York now, and he's wonderful.
It's been, like, a chance meeting, after all these years, with a true soul mate.
He senses my every need.
It's like he knows what I'm thinking.
- It's like your fantasy come true.
- I... It is.
I-I still can't believe it.
You know, it's... it's not that he's tall or handsome, but he's, um... he's magical.
And he feels me in a way that no man ever has before.
It's... He's romantic and he's sexy.
I had this dream that
I was in bed with him... and he was kissing my earlobes... and then he started stroking my shoulder blades.
I nearly had an orgasm.
I had lots of neat stuff to tell Dad.
He'd really made a big score with Von.
But now I've got to stop for a minute, because as much as we humans like to think we control things, that's not the way it works.
Suddenly, with no warning, Grandpa died.
It was in his sleep, peaceful, with no suffering, but it made philosophers of all of us.
When your number is up, your number is up.
That's why it's very important... that we cherish each moment, each moment of our lives, and not smoke.
Smoke?
Wh... I mean, he... Pop smoked for 70 years, you know.
- Well...
- He never exercised. He ate everything.
He ate cholesterol and, and fatty foods.
He died at a healthy, ripe old age.
I haven't had steak in so long. I love steak.
- Now you got him talking about food.
- Disgusting.
I'd kill for some marbleized meat.
They say six cups of coffee a day prevents, like, prevents colon cancer.
Last week it was bad for you.
What's it all about? I mean...
What are we doing? We're rushing, we're rushing.
- Th-That's right.
- Where are we going?
- They're so old.
- Into the void.
That's it. The void is it, you know. I never believed in God.
- Oh...
- No, I didn't, not even as a little kid.
I used to think... I remember this...
...even if He exists, He's done such a terrible job, - Dad! it's a wonder people don't file a class action suit against Him.
You shouldn't be talking about...
There's gotta be some reason we're here. It can't just be the new physics.
You gotta believe in something.
The dignity of Man.
The flat tax, the right to bear arms and school prayer.
- If there's nobody out there, who are they praying to? - Stop fighting.
Please don't.
- Please don't start arguing in front of Grandpa. - I can't believe you.
Wait a minute. He wasn't an atheist. He wasn't a Republican.
- He wasn't even a Democrat.
- Well, Mom, he must've been something.
- He was a foot fetishist.
- Yeah.
- It's the only group I remember him belonging to. - That's true.
He drove your mother crazy.
Pop, is that you?
I've got just one message for you.
You work and work for years and years, you're always on the go.
You never take a minute off. Too busy makin' dough.
Someday, you say, you'll have your fun when you're a millionaire.

That... was unbelievable.
Just every... thing you did and... all the things you did.
Absolutely perfect.
Well, actually, it wasn't perfect.
There was a moment in there when I stroked when I should have hickeyed, but, you know, I apologize.
I feel...
I feel limp.
You know, I'd really love you to come to Paris with me.
- I'm serious.
- Yeah?
Paris?
And then Bora Bora.
Well, well, yes, Bora
Bora, but Paris first.
Then we'd work our way down to a least one of the Boras.
We can live in your garret.
Uh, t-technically, w-when I say "garret"...
I.. It's funny. It is a garret, and yet...
- And drink wine and eat snails
'til the dawn comes up. - Snails?
Yeah. Remember?
You said how you also loved waking up in the middle of the night,
...sitting in bed eating snails, drinking wine. - Yes, yes. Yes.
I said it was such a great coincidence.
Well, they're... they're mollusks.
I-I-I love, uh, a good mollusk.
W-W-What do you mean, the wedding is off?
- Exactly what I said. I gave back his ring.
- Why?
Because there's someone else
I can't get out of my mind.
- But y-you're in love with
Holden! - No, Dad, I'm not.
At least I'm not sure I am, and I can't cheat on him while I figure it out.
- Cheat on Holden? He's gonna be your husband! - No, Dad!
- In November. I'll show you. I got receipts from caterers. - Bob, calm your denial mechanism.
It's not that Holden isn't wonderful.
It's just that somebody else has come into my life and I must see where it goes.
- It wouldn't be fair to Holden if I didn't.
- Oh, fine! Okay.
Now that we've bought you this fabulous wedding dress, would you mind telling me who this new
Prince Charming is that suddenly emerged?
- Well, you don't kn... You do, but not like I do. - I'm sick.
- Honey, what's the matter?
- My esophagus is going into spasms.
- If my necktie goes up and down...
- Look what you're doing to your father.
Tell me who has come between you and Holden.
- Well, he's bright and charming...
- Yeah? and rough to the outside, but that can change.
- Are you gonna tell us, or is this like a game show? -
You remember Charles Ferry?
- Pardon me?
- Charles Ferry.
For a minute I thought she said Charles Ferry.
- Now my esophagus is starting to move.
- Charles Ferry?
- Honey!
- The escaped convict?
- Skylar! - Ex-convict.
He has a college degree.
No, Skylar, let me tell you something.
You're having a psychotic episode. You need help!
- You need shock treatment, or industrial-strength Prozac. - Calm down.
Mom, you understand.
There is something incredibly animalistic about him.
- We'll turn him over to the zoo.
- Oh, honey.
- And yet he's like a child.
- Okay, we'll make it the children's zoo.
- He's a criminal!
- Mom, I'm shocked.
You've done nothing but sing his praises for months.
Well, yes, as a social symbol.
But as an actual person to be with my child?
- How are you going to go out with this man?
- Guys, get out of here.
You can't get behind him. He won't let you!
You try to scratch his back, he'll knife you!
Under all that veneer is a very soulful young attorney.
In fact, I was hoping you might find a place for him in your firm.
I'll make him treasurer.
He can share a room with Holden.
Speaking as a woman, Holden can be very animal too.
- Yes, Mom, but it's of the gerbil family.
- Oh, that's not...
- Get out of here!
- As your father, I forbid you... to see this man Charles Ferry.
You will marry Holden as planned.
As head of this house, I command it! I decree it!
Thou shalt wed thy intended!
- Okay, come on, let's have...
- That's it.
Let's get a drink. You're sounding tiresomely Biblical.
"Tiresomely Biblical"? What is this, Noel Coward with hockey?
- She's not gonna waste her life like this on a gangster. - Oh, she's a grown woman!
- You!
- What?
- You got him out of jail!
- This is my fault now?
Honey, what? What's wrong?
Jeffrey Vandermost asked
Lane out and not me.
- Ohh.
- Oh, my God!
How am I gonna face
Arnold and Lynn Spence?
Is that all you're thinking about?
We bought a race horse together.
He's gonna want to cut it in half!
We both liked him, and today he asked if we could talk alone, so I got all excited.
And then he asked me if I thought
Lane would go out with him... if he asked her to a dance in Connecticut... and that he had a mad crush on her.
Ohh. These things happen. Feelings are feelings and sometimes...

Uh, well, you know, loans.
Oh, this is a great idea to take a walk here. It's beautiful.
Yeah, yeah. What time is it?
Um, 4:00.
Oh, good.
I just thought you'd wanna walk around a little, see the fall leaves.
Oh, they are stunning.
It's amazing what you miss in the joint.
There's no seasons. It's just one long, gray nothin'.
What are your plans for the future?
- I can't imagine you'd wanna work in the restaurant forever. - You're right.
Work all day for what? A few lousy bucks. I got bigger plans.
- Like pursuing a law career.
- What?
A lawyer?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
- You hear somethin'?

All right, here they come. Timing's perfect.

- Yeah, yeah, come on.
- Who's she?
- She's a friend.
Why'd you have to shoot?
You didn't have to shoot!
- He was emptyin' the register!
- I got nervous!
Charles, just let me out at the corner of Park and 93rd.
Charles, let me out of this car!
I want out of this car!
I will be quiet! Just let me out!
Shut her up, or I'll shut her up!
Get out!
In October, Von finally got up the nerve and left Greg.
She bought a ticket on Air France and took the first plane to Paris.
By this time Dad had given up his flat on the Left Bank... and moved into a place... he knew would be straight out of
Von's fantasy of a Parisian apartment.
In addition to taking guitar lessons, he traded in his word processor for an old portable typewriter.
Hi.
Ahh!
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
God, look at your place.
This is, uh, out of a movie or, or out of a dr... This is, like, my dream.
This is my dream apartment, my dream view, right here.
Back in
New York, it was Halloween.
That's my favorite holiday.
I mean, all the kids in the building come trick-or-treating... and they all just look so great.

- Hey.
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you!
- Yeah? I wasn't sure.
- I was worried.
- Oh, yes!
- I'm... Holden, I'm so sorry.
- No, shh. It doesn't...
Mmm. It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
- Oh, I behaved so terribly.
- No, no, really, it was... it was me too.
- No, it wasn't.
- I missed you.
- I really missed you.
- I missed you too.
I brought you Cracker Jacks.
Holden was so much in love with my sister... that it didn't mean a thing that she had given him a hard time.
Mom and Dad were so glad to see them reunited.
He gave her back the diamond ring, only he wanted to be romantic, so he put it in a box of Cracker Jacks... and she swallowed it again.
The rest of fall was pretty normal... for us.
The only glitch we had was on Thanksgiving.
Just after dinner,
Scott suddenly collapsed.
Everybody panicked.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
There was blockage in an artery, but it's all been dissolved, so he's fine.
- He's totally fine? There's no problem?
- Oh, no. Hundred percent.
Our scan indicated that the condition occurred some time ago, perhaps a year, so if he's exhibited any strange or weird behavior, it's probably because his brain wasn't getting enough oxygen.
And wouldn't you know it, as soon as his brain started functioning properly,
Scott resigned from the Young
Conservative Republican Club... and started espousing left-wing,
Democratic, liberal philosophy.
Dad was overjoyed. He was just as proud as can be.
Remember I told you New York was the most beautiful in the fall?
What I really meant was the winter, at least when it snows.
Because under a blanket of snow,
New York City is truly gorgeous and surprisingly peaceful.
You know, when Christmas comes we don't...
We're not the kind of family that hangs stockings or sings carols.
We don't have a goose or anything.
What we do do is head right for Paris and spend our Christmas holiday at the Ritz.
Here, honey, put your finger here.
Do it, hard.
- Well, he has a fever. - Ahh-choo!
It's a cold.
I told you you should've put on some dry clothes after you fell in the fountain.
You go without me. I'll be all right.
We don't want to go without you.
The Marx Brothers' are your favorite movies. Mom, I feel so bad.
- He should stay home if he feels sick.
- I'm gonna stay home.
I'm so excited; I'm meeting this guy named Guy, or this guy named Guy.
- Cool. Congratulations.
- Here, Dad.
- I brought you some tea.
- Oh, great. Thank you.
It's not gonna keep me awake?
No, it's completely herbal.
It's peppermint flavored.
- Hello, Joe. -
Joe! - Hi, Dad!
Oh, I'd say hello, but I'm sick and, you know, you always catch everything.
- What happened?
- What's wrong?
- I'm not going tonight.
- Why not?
- I knew it.
- What's wrong, Dad?
- Von left me.
- What?
What happened?
I have no idea, but she's on her way back to New York.
When she first came, everything was perfect.
She said it was like a dream had come true for her.
And then suddenly, this morning...
Um, I want to go back home... to Greg.
Really?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Since when has, uh, this happened?
I don't know.
Well, why?
I... I...
I don't know.
I don't know how to explain it, exactly.
Well, just tell me. You know, just...
Well, it's not that I don't think that you're great. Okay?
- Um, I think you're great.
- Yeah?
Um, just, for years, you know,
I've been married to Greg, and, and he can be difficult, and we've had our ups and downs, certainly.
- Since when did you have all these...
- I don't know.
It's just, I've... I've always had this fantasy, okay, that, um... that one day I would meet the perfect man... and he would fulfill my dreams and I would have... the perfect life.
That fantasy, I think, always sort of, um, was part of this dissatisfaction that I had with Greg... and, and my life.
And then you came along and you seemed to know... every secret thing about me.
Let me put it this way.
I have seen my dream come true, and my fantasy no longer tortures me.
I can deal with it.
Yeah, but that's so neurotic.
Well, I know. I'm crazy.
Well, but supposing I said to you... that none of this was really true; that this was all a facade that I've been putting on; that-that-that somehow
I had, you know, access... to your deepest feelings and your needs and all your secret thoughts... and, and I've been, I've been playing this character... just to, just to win you over, to get you to like me, make you happy.
If that's what you told me, then I'd say you were crazy.
So that's exactly why I'm not going tonight. You know?
Instead, I-I have plans to go to Napoleon's tomb.
- I'm gonna lie down next to him. That's
Christmas Eve for me. - That's so sad.
- The women you pick.
- No, you're going out.
- Aaaaah-choo! -
Somebody's gotta take Mom.
- He's so sick.
- You're too sick to go out this evening?
- I'm fine, as long as I don't move my eyeballs. - He has a 101 temperature.
- You're not going anywhere tonight.
- But I'm not in a Groucho mood.
- Aw, come on. You'll love it. Go.
- It's Christmas Eve.
It's Paris. There's a ball.
Besides, you're on the committee that arranged the party for the Cinematheque.
- You have to go. Enjoy yourself.
- I'll go for a couple hours.
I gotta stay here, but there's no reason you don't go.
It's later than you think.

- ♪♪ - Do you remember our first Christmas Eve in Paris, the month before we got married?
I do, because that was... that was when I knew that someday I would absolutely have to live here.
Mmm. I remember it like it was yesterday.
I don't wanna panic you.
That was decades ago.
- I mean, decades, not, not...
- I know, I know. It was decades ago.
Do you remember that cafe we used to go to?
Cafe Therese, or whatever, with the cats? Do you remember?
- Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
- Yeah.
I hated that cat. I mean, I-I-I hated...
Well, maybe that's why you were scratching yourself all night.
Was I scratching myself all night?
Is that what you noticed about me?
I certainly... I certainly did.
Well, I hated that cat.
I couldn't stand it.
But now that cafe is right around the corner from where I live.
- You're joking. - Why would
I joke about something like that?
- You wanna go have a drink there?
- No.
- Why not?
- Because we're drinking here.
Well, yeah, but... We can take our mustaches off. Nobody's gonna know.
- What, are you having a nostalgic, a sudden... - Yeah, I'm having a thing.
Sue me. I just thought it would be kind of fun.
- No, we can't sneak out... - Come on, we'll take our mustaches off. No problem.
- That I'd like to do.
- Wouldn't you? Me too.
I never thought I'd hear you say, "Take my mustache off."
Please.
Anyway, we'll go. I-I'm a little... I feel good.
I've had three glasses of champagne. I feel fabulous.
- Let's go see this place. - Yeah, but y-you really wanna sneak out?
I do. It's not... We snuck out before. Do you remember?
Remember that party with the
Hamilton-Wainwrights? It was so boring.
Oh, yes. Yes.
- I remember because we snuck out through the toilet window. - Right!
The guy was singing "Climb Every
Mountain," and we couldn't bear it.
You knocked over the punch bowl, if I remember correctly.
Yes, but you were the one who let out the piercing shriek that got us caught.
Oh, and do you remember how we made love? You know...
- Ooh. Oh, I dropped...
- You dropped your cigar.
I know. Give me my cigar.
I dropped the cigar and...
You're so drunk.
I remember us making love, I, uh...
- Candlelight. - I remember the candles; I remember the hotel.
I just don't remember you, unless you were the one who was under me.
- Oh, now you're in character.
- I don't know where I am.
- I'm... I'm lost.
- Come on, let's go.
No, it's cold out there.
Our coats are in the car.
Forget it. It's a warm night.
Come on. Pretend you're young.
Well, I could for you.
You're better off without her.
How do you know? You never met her.
I know you.
Yeah. So? What does that mean?
A good psychiatrist that listened to you... would think that every time I get involved with a woman, you get jealous.
What are you laughing?
"Jealous." Joe, I just wish you'd pick somebody that could make you happy.
- Like who?
- I made you happy.
- Yeah... I didn't say you didn't.
- I made you very happy.
- Hey... - When we weren't, you know, at each other's throats.
- Does this ring a bell? This is why I took you here. -
- Does this mean anything to you?
- Is this... Is this where we...
This is it, yes. That's why
I dragged you all over town.
Oh! Ohh! Oh, my God!
- You remember this?
- This is where we stayed up all night.
I know. I held you in my arms 'til the light came up.
- Do you remember that? Do you remember that song? - Yeah, I do.
'Cause I still sing that song.
I first heard it from you.
That was the first time. Remember?

You know, over the years I often wondered what would have happened... had we stayed together.
That's something we're never gonna know.
We've managed to produce... a fabulous daughter, though.
- I mean, she is unbelievable. - Mm-hmm.
She's got your looks, fortunately, and my... my magic personality.
- Yeah, she is wonderful.
- She's great.
And-And you've been very happy with
Bob, so that's been a good thing.
- Oh, he's wonderful.
- I think he's great.
I don't think you could've done better. I think he's a fabulous guy.
Of course there have been a few times, you will admit, that, uh, you did call me in dire emergency... and I had to come by and bail you out.
- I know you did.
- Two major fights with Bob, I remember, and one disgusting lump that turned out to be completely benign, though you were panicked beyond belief.
- You were there for me.
That's the main thing. - And you for me.
And I appreciate it.
I think, actually, that we-we've been better friends... than, than, than husband and wife.
Yeah, probably we have.
But, you know, nobody made me laugh the way you did, Joe.
I love Bob with all my heart. It isn't that.
It's just that you could always, you know, you could push that button.
- Why is that so important?
- I don't know.
I don't know. Maybe we're crazy.
So, did that girl that dumped you today, did she make you laugh?
I don't know, I... I have to put that behind.
You know.
- Funny how life goes.
- It's amazing. Amazing.
Let's go. It's late.
It's definitely late.
Christmas Eve and late.
Let's go.

Christmas Eve in Paris.
What a year.
And that sort of brings us to the end of our story.
I told Skylar someone should write it up as a movie.
She said, " Better make it into a musical, or no one's gonna believe it."
By the way, that night
I met a terrific guy.
I mean, talk about sexy.

My mother tells me that by five years old... l had decided definitively to become a concert pianist. l think she had decided sometime earlier.
The story goes that while l was in the womb... she played the piano continuously to give me a head start... and evidently it paid off.
My mother was my first teacher and l've never doubted her methods.
After all she introduced me to Bach.
Oh good. Try another.
By the age of ten l had the first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier... pretty much under my belt.
Good. Oh that's good.
Very good.
Let's try one up at this end here.
My childhood was full of music even at our cottage on Lake Simcoe.
Those days seem particularly idyllic to me at least in retrospect.
- Go ahead.
- They were compared to my school days.
Eight-seven times twenty-three is--
At an early age l could read music and memorize it on the spot. ln fact l could read music before l could read words. l remember l used to play a game with my mother... where l would identify the chords she played from the other side of the house.
People always seem to make a great deal out of these early signs... but they hardly constitute miracles in my opinion. l simply have a facility with a certain kind of minutia.
- l always have.
- 87 times 26 equals 2262.
Eighty-seven times--
Eighty-seven times 27 equals 2349.
Eighty-seven times 28 equals 2436. l often think how fortunate l was... to have been brought up in an environment... where music was always present.
Who knows what would have become of me otherwise? lt's a question l often ask myself... but l've yet to come up with an answer.
After all when we met for the first time in a hotel in Toronto... after having talked at length several times over the phone... or having written to make our first appointment-- l met him the temperature was ninety degrees it was very warm--
He was wearing a coat a hat scarves and gloves--
A seemingly extravagant getup... which in fact corresponded exactly to the protection he needed... against the outside world to protect himself from what finally killed him--
Problems of germs and blood pressure--
So let us say that the first vision... one would have of such a person was very surprising.
You could not avoid being surprised at the sight of someone resembling a tramp.
But he walked into the hotel room and stayed 1 8 hours straight.
No outside worry food or anything... interrupted the rapport we were establishing.
The other striking thing was his sense of humor... his extraordinary ability to have fun and offer ideas stimulating... both because of their depth and because they were fun.
So this slightly bizarre manner which was the first thing you caught... and which lasted for that brief instant of the first meeting and then was over--
This disappeared very quickly to make way for the real man that he was... who was not trying to shock others.
He was just trying to express himself.
Mr. Gould to begin let me ask straight out: Are there any off-limit areas? l certainly can't think of any apart from music of course.
Well Mr. Gould l don't want to go back on my word.
Your participation in this interview was never contractually confirmed... but l assumed we'd spend the bulk of the interview on music-related matters.
Do you think it's essential? l mean my own personal philosophy of interviewing-- and l've done quite a bit of it on the air as perhaps you know-- is that the most illuminating disclosures usually derive from areas... only indirectly related to the interviewee's line of work.
- For example?
- ln preparing radio documentaries... l've interviewed a theologian about technology... a surveyor about William James... and a housewife about acquisitiveness in the art market.
But surely you've interviewed musicians about music.
Well yes l have on occasion but only to put them at ease with the mike.
But it's been far more instructive to talk with Leopold Stokowski... about the prospect for interplanetary travel which is l'm sure you'll agree--
Let me ask this: ls there a subject you'd particularly like to discuss?
What about native rights in Alaska?
Well l must confess l had a rather more conventional line of attack... so to speak in mind Mr. Gould.
As l'm sure you're aware the virtually obligatory question about your career... is the controversy you created by giving up live concert performance at age 3 2... and choosing to communicate only through the media. l do feel we must at least touch on it.
As far as l'm concerned it primarily... involves moral rather than musical considerations. ln any case be my guest.
Now you've been quoted as saying that your involvement with recording-- with media in general indeed represents the future.
- That's correct.
- And conversely the concert stage... the opera house or whatever represent the past-- an aspect of your own past in particular perhaps... as well as in more general terms music's past.
That's true. l hope you'll forgive me for saying that these ideas are only partly justified.
Also l feel that you
Mr. Gould have forgone... the privilege that is rightfully yours of communicating with an audience.
From a power base?
From a setting in which the naked fact of your humanity... is unedited and unadorned.
Couldn't l at least be allowed to display the tuxedoed fallacy perhaps?
Please Mr. Gould we shouldn't allow this conversation to degenerate. l've tried to pose the question in all candor and--
Well then l'll try and answer likewise.
To me the ideal audience-to-artist relationship... is a one-to-zero relationship.
- That's the moral objection.
- Run that by me again?
First l'm not at all happy with words like "public" and "artist"... or the hierarchical implications of that kind of terminology.
The artist should be granted anonymity.
He should be permitted to operate in secret as it were... unconcerned with or better still unaware of the marketplace's demands... which demands given enough indifference on the part of enough artists... will simply disappear.
Given that disappearance the artist will then abandon his false sense... of public responsibility... and his audience or "public" will relinquish its...
- role of servile dependency.
- And never the twain shall meet.
No they'll make contact but on a much more meaningful level.
Well Mr. Gould l'm well aware that this sort of... idealistic role swapping has a certain rhetorical flourish.
The creative audience concept of which you've spoken at length elsewhere... has a kind of McLuhan-esque fascination.
But you conveniently forget that the artist however hermetic his life... is still in effect an autocratic figure.
He's still however benevolently a social dictator... and his public however generously enfranchised by electronic options... is still on the receiving end of the experience.
All your neomedieval anonymity quest on behalf of the "artist-as-zero"... and all your vertical pan-culturalism on behalf of his "public" won't change it.
May l speak now?
Of course. Sorry to get carried away.
But l do feel strongly about the--
- About the artist as Superman?
- That's not quite fair Mr. Gould.
Or about the interlocutor as controller of conversation perhaps?
There's no need to be rude.
What about this? lf you imagine that the artist--
Yes. That's right.
Toronto.
Toronto Canada? lt should read as follows:
" Dear Walter. Stop.
Under the weather yesterday. Stop.
X-rays reveal chronic bronchitis--
Bronchitis in right lung. Stop.
Feeling as foggy as it is outside. Stop.
Stop. lt would suit you perfectly. Stop.
Cannot and will not leave this room. Stop. End."
Sir l am sorry to disturb but we have a--
- From New York? Yes.
- Yes sir.
At last. Excellent. Thank you.
Yes that would be it indeed.
Could you read that back to me please?
Wait. Wait please stay.
"Concerts tomorrow and Monday cancelled" not "can't sell."
That means something entirely different.
Go ahead.
Yes.
That's absolutely flawless. Could you send it off immediately please?
Room 31 8.
Thank you.
Salzburg to Stockholm Berlin...
Wiesbaden Florence
Tel AvivJerusalem... and on the whole tour l'd say there were maybe six good hotel rooms... five comfortable beds and at least three adequate pianos.
Some of these pianos were so hopelessly unwieldy... l decided it was best just to ignore them. lt required a kind of mystical transcendence to get me through. l have no idea what the audience resorted to. l'm not one of those piano freaks you know. Of course... l know there are people who would gladly sit in the most uncomfortable chair... with 3000 other people in uncomfortable chairs... and listen to hours and hours of the stuff... but it's nothing l would ever subject myself to. l just don't like the sound of piano music that much.
Five minutes Mr. Gould.
Yeah. Tell them to close the doors now.
Yeah l think he's ready now. l told you go ahead. Here he comes.
This way Mr. Gould. l didn't want to bother you now but l'm not gonna be here after the show.
- Fine.
- Gary's gonna be here-- the guy with the short you know-- he's gonna pick you up.
And there is a reception after. l know it's gonna be squaresville man... but you'd make some gray-haired ladies happy if you waltz through it one time. l did wanna show you a schedule for tomorrow. No don't bother with it now.
Don't think about it. But later if you wanna change anything--
- l'm sure it's fine.
-you wanna see more of L.A.-- l'm gonna leave it on your dresser. l think we should take the stairs.
Maybe we should.
Don't even think about it now.
- lt's a long way.
- lt certainly is. lf it weren't for you l'd have been dropping bread crumbs along the way.
- Mr. Gould?
- Of course.
- My wife has all of your records.
- Well... tell your wife that she has exceptional taste.
Also she's very lucky. l'm never going to sign one of these again.
How long have you worked for this theater? lt's been almost 30 years.
Thirty years? You must be near retirement? lf you don't mind my asking.
- No. At the end of the season.
- What will you do after that?
- Well l have my garden.
- Yes? l'm going to build an arboretum.
- You know what that is?
- Yes l think so.
My best to your wife and garden.
Thank you.
What did he say?
What did he write?
"April 1 0 1 964. Best of luck on your new career. Glenn Gould--
The Final Concert." l think that like all people who try to justify their stand... do what they want to do anyway... yet still want to justify it in a universal manner--
He too fell in this trap... of somewhat exaggerating the morality of his decision.
Of course in a way he was right. ln an audience some hear better than others some see better than others.
Sometimes in large churches people are seated behind pillars and can't see.
Acoustics can be exaggerated.
You hear too much or too little... the volume is too high or the reverberation hurts the ears.
He is right. lt's not always ideal.
But it's part of life.
For me it exists as a live element.
Personally l find Glen Gould's life too... too artificial.
But as l said it's because l am not in his league as a creator. l cannot make a life for myself on my own excluding everybody else... and concentrating only on this intellectual exercise.
And the physical-- Trying to avoid drafts protected by a scarf... not tolerating someone touching my shoulder...
And at the same time he loved going to fishing villages... over the great--
The great distances that Canada offers.
He liked that.
He liked nature.
He liked natural men.
He liked the fisherman much more than a New York audience.
Ready?
Glenn we're ready for playback. l'm gonna give it to you without EQ-ing okay?
And all the levels are flat.
Ready in three two... one.
- Coffee?
- Yes. Yes. l really shouldn't be giving this to you you know. lt's not very good for you.
You mean coffee in general or your coffee?
No coffee and cream as a combination-- it's very bad for you.
- lt's dangerous.
- Where did you get this? lt just sits in your stomach like-- like asphalt. l read it in a magazine.
The coffee from that machine is gonna kill me anyway so a little cream--
Yeah you're one to talk. l mean look at you.
You're falling apart there.
Now he could use some coffee.
Sugar on the other hand is actually a very good combination. lt actually helps the coffee do what it's supposed to do. So--
The ltalian Concerto.
You know this is really good. l really think we have something here.
How was that? l think there's something in that.
Let's hear it again. l became Glenn Gould's chambermaid because the other chambermaids... who were mostly middle-aged ltalian and
Jamaican women were terrified of him.
They thought he was strange-- probably some sort of sexual deviant.
They just found him peculiar because he was very eccentric.
When we were in Moscow in 1 957 we stayed at the Canadian embassy... and after the first concert... we went back into our limousine which had been loaned to us by the embassy.
At the end of the concert Glenn had received a huge number of flowers... and big pots of mums and other flowers... and as we got into the limousine and sat down... all the flowers had been piled up there and we had barely room to sit.
Glenn said to me
"You know Walter... it feels like we are driving to our own funeral at this point."
This was his passion.
He really really wanted to start-- you know retire away to Manitoulin lsland... to buy a big hunk of it and bring every unwanted animal in the world there.
There were numerous boxes-- l think one time l counted a dozen boxes of arrowroot cookies... sort of scattered about the room.
There were also numerous bottles of ketchup. lt was a very penetrating interview-- the most intelligent questions l think l'd ever heard about the North... from experts laymen or anything else-- questions that required rather long answers.
As l would start to speak or make a point... he would register his feelings not by voice but by a smile... but all the time he was using his hands and conducting.
This might be slightly off-putting when you're trying to think deep thoughts... because l had no idea what this was all about... but he continuously was just waving his arms... and would sort of bring up this idea and so on. l was his orchestra for that hour.
So he decided to wear this business suit... and l discussed it with him and l said "You know Glenn... l'm not sure the public will understand what you're trying to convey... but if you want to do it go ahead" which he did.
And he was probably the first artist who went out on stage... without what was considered then the proper concert attire.
But he again was in the forefront of change.
He used to wake up at about 4:00 in the afternoon... and to get himself awake he used to phone people... and l was one of those people he phoned.
He'd talk about anything you know.
He just wanted a listening board.
One night he called and he was babbling on... and it was probably 1 :00 in the morning something like that... and he-- and l fell asleep.
As a matter of fact before l fell asleep... l had stretched out on the rug and l had the phone there...
'cause l'd been sitting in the chair and got tired so l stretched out.
He was talking talking talking and l wasn't talking at all. and l fell asleep.
The next thing l knew my son had walked into the room... and he was kicking me on the soles of my feet.
He said "Wake up.
There's somebody on the phone." lt was Glenn and he was talking away. l don't know how long l had been sleeping... but l didn't even remember the sequence he was just--
The words were just pouring out.
The phone rang and as l picked it up it was Glenn Gould on the other end.
He said " Hi this is Glenn Gould and l feel like talking."
" Mario" he said "l came across the most marvelous opera for your program." l said "What is it?"
He said "You know Ernst Krenck?" l said "Yes certainly."
He said...
"l've got this marvelous opera by him."
He said "Wait l've got the score here. l'll sing it to you."
So he sang this entire one-act opera-- one-act two-scene opera-- over the telephone... in his not-very-pleasant voice.
He was very much involved with himself.
You know he didn't think of what others had to-- what others had to do or their responsibilities.
You know he was consumed with-- with what he was doing and his own things.
His will was that he left... half of estate to the SPCA--
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-- and the other half to the Salvation Army.
Yes! Getting 31 8 back from Ottawa... to tune for the conservatory... when l was phoned up about it... l thought "Should l do this?" l thought " No l'm going to do it just for old-times' sake."
And when l got working on 31 8 again and cleaned it up... and tuned it and worked on the action a bit... it felt good.
So l guess l miss him. l miss his intelligent comments... and l miss listening to his 20 questions... not particularly to me but--
He was-- l'll tell you one thing.
Today l had a customer phone me up and say...
"Can you come tomorrow to tune my piano?"
Glenn Gould used to give me two or three months notice... and l respected that... and l'm very thankful for knowing him.
Hello Mr. Gould.
Do you want the usual?
Yes if you'd be so kind.
Yeah l agree. For instance one time up by the reptile house-- you know where that is up near Parry Sound-- l see this hippie-yippie type thumbin' a ride.
Long hair out to here. l figured l'd pick him up anyway-- keep me entertained for a while
'cause l'm goin' all night.
Keep me awake.
Only when l pick him up it turns out it wasn't a hippie at all-- lt was a girl-- a young girl... and l mean pretty like you never seen.
So l says to her "What the hell you doin' out here all by yourself eh?"
And a hundred miles down the road l got her whole life story.
Seems like she had a fight with her boyfriend.
They broke up.
Then she had a fight with her parents...
- and decided to run away from home--
-Janet? generation gap or whatever the hell it was.
Sit down. lt's not the right time but l need to talk to you.
A hundred miles later she's curled up next to me...
They are going to change my route. l won't be coming this way anymore. l looked down at this sweet little
1 6-year-old thing...
The same route for three years.
The change isn't so bad. l turned my rig around and l took her straight home--
Do you know how many times l've come here? l've counted: 1 56.
You should have seen the look on her parents' face.
- Fifty bucks pal.
- They screwed us man.
Damn lmlach. We would have been better off with Clancy.
Ohlman Anderson Ellis-- who needs 'em?
- lf we still had Maholovich--
- Yeah but you don't.
- You see there's a code l live by.
- Because it's over. l gotta go now.
- Montreal's gonna take it. Wanna bet?
- A strict ethical code. l believe it.
- So come on-- rack 'em up.
- You rack 'em up.
- l practice it.
- Okay ten bucks. l never regret it not a minute-- never.
No sir.
Okay Glenn l'm ready to start.
Yeah l'll give you the whole thing from the top and when we get-- l'll just hit the "record"button and you can start.
Are you all set? Here we go.
Stand by.
Ready? Here we go.
Three two-- l was fascinated by the country as such. l flew north from Churchill... to Coral Harbour on Southampton lsland at the end of September.
Snow had begun to fall and the country was freshly covered by it.
Some of the lakes were frozen around the edges... but toward the center of the lake you could still see the clear clear water.
Flying over this country you could look down and see... various shades of green in the water and you could see the lake bottoms... and it was a most fascinating experience. l remember l was up in the cockpit with the pilot... and l was forever looking out left and right... and l could see ice floes over Hudson Bay... and l was always looking for polar bears or seals to spot. but unfortunately there were none.
And as we flew along the east coast of Hudson Bay--
- this flat country frightened me...
- l don't know. Let me say this again.
- l don't go for this northmanship.
- because it just seemed endless.
We just seemed going into nowhere.
And the further north we went the more monotonous.
But l see it as a kind of a game-- this northmanship thing.
People say "Well were you ever up at the North Pole?" l say "l did a dogsled trip of 22 days"... and the other fellow says
"Well l did one of 30 days. "
Perhaps they would see themselves--
Sure the North's changed my life. l can't conceive... of anyone being in close touch with the North... whether he lived there all the time or simply travelled it... month after month year after-- l can't conceive of such a person being really untouched by the North.
When l left in 1 965-- at least left the job-- lt was not like there was some special merit some virtue... to being in the North or some special virtue... in having been with the primitive people.
You know what special virtue is there in that? lt is most diffiicult to describe. lt was extreme observation.
This is very true. l knew very well l could not go anywhere except for a mile or two walking. l always think of the long summer nights when the snow had melted... the lakes were open and the geese and ducks had started to fly home.
During that time the sun would set... and when there was still the last shimmer in the sky... l would walk out to one of those lakes... and watch those ducks and geese just fly around peacefully... or sitting on the water... and l felt that l was almost part of that country-- part of that peaceful surrounding-- and l wished that it would never end.
This is Glenn Gould and this program is called "The ldea of North."
Let's talk about the radio documentaries you made for the CBC.
Two of your programs "The ldea of North" and "The Latecomers"... are both about the idea of solitude... as it affects people living in Northern Canada. ln fact all of those programs deal to some degree with solitude. l've made five programs that have taken 300 or 400 hours of studio time.
Number one was as you mentioned
"The ldea of North."
Two was " Latecomers."
Three was "Stokowski."
Four is one we're just mixing now on Casals--
"Casals: A Portrait for Radio." l'm doing one next year on Schoenberg and there's one that's lain around... for a year and a half. lt's a program about the Mennonites called "Quiet in the Land"... and that's the ultimate in community isolation.
So next l want to do a comedy about an isolated man... because l'm sick and tired of all these profound statements.
Well radio itself is a solitary experience.
Why does it interest you as a medium? l'd like to deal with this as sensibly as l can. lt's a big question. lt's an important question. l don't know what the effective ratio would be... but l've always had a sort of intuition... that for every hour you spend with other human beings... you need X number of hours alone.
Now what that X represents l don't really know-- whether it be two and seven-eighths or seven and two-eighths-- but it's a substantial ratio.
Radio is something that's been very close to me since l was a child... something l listen to virtually nonstop. l mean it's wallpaper for me. l sleep with the radio on in fact.
Now l'm incapable of sleeping without the radio on... ever since l gave up Nembutal.
Does it affect your dreams?
Sure insofar as if there are broadcasts on the hour... l will pick up the bulletins and dream them... and in the morning if there's a boat that's just gone down... l'll think "Gee that was on odd dream about the Titanic l had last night."
And l will have of course gone through it.
Maybe your feelings about solitude come from your Nordic temperament. l think that's certainly part of it. lt's always been an ambition of mine... which l'll probably never get around to realizing... to spend at least one winter north of the Arctic Circle.
Anyone can go there in the summer when the sun is up... but l want to go there when the sun is down l really do... and so help me l'm going to do it one of these times. l've been saying this for five or six years now... and every year the schedule gets in the way.
Well l hope you do.
Thank you very much Mr. Gould.
Mr. Gould thank you for the interview yesterday. l would just like some further clarification if l may.
That's good. Where am l?
Okay here we are.
Now if it's really true that you attach little importance... to the actual technique of playing the piano... how is it that you have managed to attain such a level of skill at it?
Well that is to say don't you think it's depressing... for all the young pianists of the world to know this? l really want to thank you from the bottom of my heart... for arranging for me to have this chance to interview you finally.
And before we begin the interview... l also want to give you a great big thank you... on behalf of all of our readers.
These are tough questions.
They're gonna come up.
People are gonna watch the play.
They're gonna ask me.
Glenn Gould is apparently incredibly interested in technology... but really wasn't technology just a reason... or a way for him to keep the world at arm's length? lt's just a big smoke screen isn't it?
Let me ask you this:
What is Glenn Gould really like when he's not in the studio? l mean what do you like to do when you're outside of a recording booth?
What kind of lifestyle do you lead?
Mr. Gould you are a perfectionist when it comes to recording.
So why is it when you are recording you place little importance... on whether you have a piano with noisy works or a chair that squeaks?
Why when you seem obsessed with this idea of musical perfection... do you hum as you play?
Well-- l forgot the question. l mean what aspect of your life... has nothing to do... with-- with-with... anything that has to do with... classical musical music?
Years ago you said that you were gonna leave public performance... because you wanted to compose... and we've waited and the years have passed... and there's no body of work-- l mean musically speaking-- and people are waiting.
How do you feel about all that?
Would you teach me piano?
What about children? l mean have you thought about that?
What do you look for in a woman?
Or maybe l should just say what are you waiting for?
One more question if l may out of curiosity.
Why do you insist on conducting interviews by phone?
Mr. Gould you stated that in our culture there are economic... and social forces at play which have already rendered... concert halls obsolete.
Furthermore you expected... these halls to disappear by the year 2000. ln which way does this statement allow you to look anew... upon the mechanics and the economy of the music market... and on the subservience of the artist to this system?
Well um--
Obsolete. l know.
You left the concert platform. lt's been talked about it's been explained... all the reasons but when you think about it... on the day that it happened it was about fear wasn't it?
While you consider this new cultural order as the emancipation... of the artist it seems in my opinion that this vision encourages... a techno-hegemony and the exploitation of the artist... by capitalistic mega-structures don't you think? l've asked you about your music l've asked you about your family... l've asked you about your children what you had for dinner... l've asked you what you do when you go to a movie.
Mr. Gould you've stated... that the concert hall is becoming... more and more of an economic liability... but that you foresee this problem rectifying itself by the year 2000.
Why?
Okay fine.
Are you homosexual?
Why didn't you answer my calls?
Why did you stop calling me?
You know l am deeply in love with a certain beautiful girl. l asked her to marry me but she turned me down... but l still love her more than anything in the world... and every minute l can spend with her is pure heaven.
But l don't want to be a bore... and if l can only get her to tell me when l could see her it would help.
She has a standing invitation to let me take her anywhere she'd like to go... anytime but it seems to me she never has time for me.
Please if you see her ask her to let me know... when l can see her and when l can--
Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani arrived in Ottawa today to begin... a series of discussions across Canada about the future of oil pricing.
- The powerful Saudi oil minister--
- Howie thanks for holding. lt's me your fairy godmother.
You just cleared 30 grand in your sleep.
1 2000 Texas Gulf at 46. Call me and let me know how the options open.
Sorry sir. What's on the recommender?
Play it safe. l'm sticking with the big one.
Oil that is black gold Texas tea.
Across the board: Gulf Dome Petrofina.
Take your pick hold on for the ride.
We're going through the roof here. l'm looking at 3 2 by the bell. Okay.
Sotex Resources?
No never heard of it.
Yeah l'll check the charts.
Yeah but again l'm telling you oil right now... is as close to a sure thing as we got in this business and it's crazy to sell.
Sotex. No.
Got nothing on it. Sounds risky to me.
You want it you got it.
- Who's that? Who is it?
- Glenn Gould. l'll just ask you to remember in the days and weeks ahead... this was your bright idea.
That's my job. Later.
- The piano player?
- Yeah Glenn Gould the piano player.
Okay got a buy for you:
1 0000 STX Gould.
- What's the special of the day?
- Canstar Oil and Gas.
- Eleven and three quarters.
- Mr. Mackie lunched with the minister.
There's an incentive program in the air.
- Well l don't buy it.
- He's in for 90 thou.
The Pormack brothers are in tight with the Saudis. They've mopped up all week.
So as long as this embargo holds--
- lt's going up up and away.
- Anything else Mr. Gould?
Yes l'll have a cup of coffee and a telephone.
- Everybody's buying.
- l'm afraid l can't agree.
What do you mean?
Do you know something? l had a small word with Sheik Yamani's bodyguard at the airport and--
- And what?
- Now... this one has to be kept strictly between you and me.
STX-- Sotex Resources?
Never heard of it.
The sheik has and he's about to deliver them a major explorations contract.
This is entirely entre nous.
This is just between you and me.
Sotex? Hang on one second.
- Here it is.
- Little stock called Sotex. Hear of it?
Sotex ten and a third.
Get me 20000 shares.
Mines natural resources stuff from up north you know.
Listen Sheik Yamani is very interested in this company.
The TSE dropped 40 points as a result of this morning's announcement... and the Dow fell back an alarming 7 2 points.
One of the few bright spots in the midst of this doom and gloom... was a tiny company called Sotex Resources... which closed at 1 5.3.
Ten and a quarter. Ditch it for
Christ's sake. What are you waiting for?
Yeah Howie unfortunately we are looking at a bit of a dip.
Down 1 2 points. Well that's the way the game works. You know the risk.
Sotex? Sure.
You want a piece?
Look what do you want me to say?
You lost l lost everybody lost.
Take it up with OPEC.
Whatever you say Glenn.
You know l have to confess you were my only client who made a buck last week.
And a pretty good one too.
Hey listen you gave up touring.
Maybe you should give up playing piano altogether and just play the market.
That's right a virtuoso.
Yeah l'll talk to you soon.

He didn't talk to me about drugs very much... except these instances when he would excuse himself... and then-- it was interesting.
Of course there was a bathroom in this hotel suite... and l asked him if l could use the bathroom.
These sessions went on for six and seven hours and so l did-- l remember going in there and seeing lined up on the wall... all these different bottles and l came out and l said-- l said "Glenn surely you're not taking all this stuff are you?"
He said "Well no not all at once" and sort of laughed. l don't understand that in him. l never understood that and he-- l didn't have the feeling that he was acting in a-- in a way that had been produced by a drug.
He was neither speeding nor was he sort of you know... not in control of his any kinds of anything.
And here was this lineup of bottles.
Mr. Gould we've covered a lot of the topics... that l wanted to cover with you.
But could we perhaps move on to some of the more personal questions?
Tell me do you believe in the supernatural... or in ESP?
You know no one's ever asked me that before.
Do l believe in the supernatural?
Of course.
Yes... and no.
That is to say... l don't hold with this notion... that one's mind can be read like a book... or some such thing.
But that there are... certain inexplicable coincidences in the world... seems to me patently obvious.
Have you ever experienced any of those coincidences?
Could you tell me about it?
Yes several times... the oddest being when l was very young-- nine years old. l should preface this by saying... that l've always been fascinated by dreams... and the kind of feeling... that they leave one with.
There's a certain horrible feeling... tragic sense of loss... that one can derive only from a dream.
Anyway at this time... l was about nine years old--
Pardon me.
About nine years old and l had this peculiar dream... in which l saw myself covered with red spots.
The next morning when l mentioned it to my mother... she'd had exactly the same dream.
Now at that time there was no hint of measles... no epidemic no worry of any kind... so the dream certainly couldn't have been affected... by any external common suggestion.
And yet four days later l got the measles.
Very interesting.
Tell me continuing... what do you believe regarding afterlife?
Well l was brought up a Presbyterian... though l stopped being a churchgoer... at about the age of 1 8. l've always felt tremendously strongly... that... there is indeed a hereafter... with which we must all reckon... in light of which we must live our lives... and there is that inevitability of the transformation of the spirit.
As a consequence... l find all here-and-now philosophies quite repellent-- lax if you will. l realize however that there's a great temptation... to formulate a comfortable theory about eternal life... so as to reconcile oneself to the inevitability of death.
But l'd like to think that's not what l'm doing. l don't believe l'm trying to create for myself... a deliberate self-reassuring process. lt just seems intuitively right. l've never had to work very hard of convincing myself of a hereafter.
After all don't you think it seems infinitely more plausible... than its opposite: oblivion?
HelloJessie it's me. l wonder could indulge me for a moment? l'm in a bit of a state.
Well l was driving along... when l suddenly remembered that story about Schoenberg.
Schoenberg.
Remember he was obsessed with numerology numbers and so forth.
So much so that when he turned 65... he was terrified that he was going to die... because his age was divisible by 1 3.
So he consulted an astrologer friend who assured him that he would survive... until the next time the numbers conspired against him.
"Well great" he thought
"another 1 3 years. l'll be fine until l'm 7 8."
Eleven years later however when he was 7 6... the astrologer wrote back to warn him that it's not only numbers... that are divisible by 1 3 that he ought to watch out for... but also those whose digits add up to 1 3.
For example 7 6.
Needless to say he was petrified but not for long.
Three months later he died...
July 13 1951 . l can't help it. l'm 49 tomorrow... and Schoenberg's still talking to me.
Jessie?
Jessie are you there?
The week before he died l remember it in great detail.
And it's funny that-- lt's peculiar that l do remember it in such detail... because many of the times our conversations were light... and just banter between two good friends.
But that week before Glenn died... everything was serious.
He couldn't control the birthday... that was coming up-- the celebration.
He couldn't--
He seemed to think... everything was slipping away from his control... and he was obsessed with this feeling that he wondered-- would people recognize him and come to a funeral... and we'd never talked about anything like that before.
But he said that he wanted--
He didn't-- He would like to be like Huckleberry Finn... and come to his own funeral... because he didn't think that there would be people who came.
He didn't think that the world loved him like they did... and he knew about how the records were selling... he knew that they were very-- thatJapanese people bought a lot of them... that people in Central Europe... and in Asia bought a lot of them... but he just didn't think... that he was that important... and it never surfaced that to me at least... that he felt his own... fame.
His humility was beyond everything.
And when l saw the people pour into...
St. Paul's Cathedral... l couldn't help but believe
"Oh Glenn you were wrong... for probably the first time in your life."
You know 'cause he always liked to think he never was wrong.
HelloJessie? lt's me. l was just out driving along and guess what came on the radio.
Here.
Well?
Yes sure it's one of the French suites but which one?
And there you have it--
Johann Sebastian Bach... the Saraband from French Suite No. 1 ... performed with the unmistakable genius of the young Glenn Gould.
Tragically Mr. Gould passed away this morning at the age of 50.
He died in hospital in Toronto after suffering a stroke last week.
Since that time he'd been on a life support system... and never regained consciousness. ln the fall of 1 97 7... the U.S. government sent two ships
Voyagers l and ll into space... where they are eventually destined to reach the edge of our galaxy. ln the hope that someone somewhere would intercept these craft... a variety of messages were placed on board... that would be capable of communicating the existence... of an intelligent creature... living on a planet called Earth.
Among these was included a short prelude byJohann Sebastian Bach... as performed by Glenn Gould.
Voyagers l and ll left our solar system respectively... in 1987 and 1989.

Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Anna Mae, sit down. Sit down.
Now, Anna Mae,

But believe me, honey, you was too young to understand what was goin' on with your Daddy and me.
Did Alline understand?
She ain't that much older than me.
Now, don't think you gonna come live in my house and make me feel bad.
You're gonna pull your weight, girl.

Yes, ma'am.

- Of course!
- Coffee?
That's all right. That's all right.
Forget it.
Here you are, miss.
Thank you.
I thought you ran out of smokes.

- Here's your silverware.
Ready to order?
Look here, I'm gonna have the steak and eggs, over easy.
And be sure to get whatever you want, hear?
- Miss?
- I'll have a steak.
Okay.
Anna Mae!
Girl, you shocked the hell out of me!
Where a little woman like you get such a big voice?
You had them folks tore down in there!
Let me put it to you this way.
It's like you sang like a man.
I mean, you all woman.
You all woman, any man can see that, but girl, it's like you got your own particular way of gettin' a song out ya.
It's unique.
You got your own unique sound.
See, that's what sells records.
You got a flair.
Yeah, you definitely got a flair, girl.
- Do you have a flair?
- A flair? Yes, I do.
Matter of fact,
I got a flair for writin' songs and I also have a flair for makin' singers famous.
What do you mean?
People that's come up with me, folks that sang in my Revue, a lot of 'em went on to be big time.
After they with me, they take off, but that's all right, though.
That's all right.
That's all fixin' to change.
- Steak.
- I got a new singer in mind.
Yeah? He good?
Oh, yes, indeed. She is real good.
Matter of fact, she's very good.
He say he want me to be his new singer.
What's she talkin' about now?
He told you that?
- Who?
- Ike, Mama! Ike Turner!
And he gave you his address to come around and rehearse. Lord...
What's a Ike Turner?
Anna Mae, get your gullible country ass out of the clouds.
He does that to all the girls.
That's his line.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Alline, how come this string of pearls is shorter?
Did you cut off my pearls, girl?
This is tighter around my neck.
Maybe it's all them chitlins you ate.
- Don't get smart with me, Miss Alline.
- What?
Who is that in a red convertible?
Red convertible?
Mornin'.
May I speak to your mother, please.
My mother?
Anna Mae Bullock's mother,
Mrs. Bullock, does she live here?
I'm her mother.
This is Anna Mae's mother!
Y'all believe that?
- I can't believe that.
- No.
My goodness, what's a fine young thing like you doin' with two grown daughters?
- Hey, Miss Alline.
- How can I help you, Mr...
Turner. Ike Turner.
The Kings of Rhythm.
We play down at the Club Royal every...
Listen, Mrs. Bullock.
Anna Mae sang at the club last night.
- She knocked everybody out.
- No joking.
Mr. Turner say I got a flair, Mama.
- The kind would sell records.
- Mama, Anna Mae can sing.
I didn't pay for Anna Mae to come all the way up here from Nutbush, Tennessee to be wastin' time with a bunch of musicians.
Well, wait a minute, Mama, it wasn't like that. Anna Mae...
- Alline, take Anna Mae in the back.
- But, Mama...
Yes, ma'am.
- Come on, Anna Mae.
- Go on, girl.
Mr. Turner, I don't know what you had in mind, but this little girl's gonna be a nurse and bring a steady paycheck in this house.
Yes, ma'am, but Miss Bullock, did you ever see a nurse drivin' an automobile as fine as mine?
Meaning... May I?
Now, look here, if you let Anna Mae work with me,
I guarantee you she'll be makin' big money in no time.
You tellin' me
Anna Mae sing that good?
Put it like this.
I could get anybody in St. Louis to sing in my band, but I want her.
Think about it.
Let her come to a few rehearsals.
Let me work with her.
You're welcome to sit in if you like.
You have my word as a gentleman she'll be under my protection.
I noticed my boys crushed some of your flowers accidentally outside.
That should cover the damages.
We'll be expectin' her around seven o'clock this evening.
It's been a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Bullock, and you have a nice day now.
Make me over
Make me nice
And when I'm done
Oh, I wanna be right
I wanna be made up
Anna Mae, you're gonna have to sing rougher. You hear me?
Rougher! From here.
Okay? All right.
We'll take it from the top.
Here we go. And one, two, three, and...
I'm talkin' to the priest
Rougher, Anna Mae.
The high priest
Come on. Rougher.
And everybody out there in the universe
If what I'm sayin' is wrong
I don't understand what you mean by "rougher."
- What's "rougher" mean?
- Sing.
Now you got that girl screamin' like a maniac.
- Yes, ma'am. Keep singing.
- That makes no sense.
Look here.
That's what sells records, Ms. Bullock.
- Look, do you want a drink?
- Yeah, I want a drink...
- Keep singin'.
- But I'm watchin' this rehearsal.
Come on, I'll get you a drink in the back.
Come on, Alline.
I wanna watch this rehearsal.
Give me a liniment
And wash me clean
Make me over
Make me nice
And when I'm done
Oh, I wanna be right
Hey Lord, make me over
I wanna be made over
Make me over
I wanna be made over
From here. Let me hear it.
I wanna go crazy
I wanna do some things
Yeah.
I wanna be a star
Oh, I wanna have a big name
And in my heart let beauty reign
And when I'm done
Oh, I wanna have fame
Oh Lord, make me over
I wanna be made over
Oh Lord, make me over
All right! Go ahead, Anna.
I wanna be made over
I wanna be made over
Make me over
- I wanna be made over
- Make me over
I wanna be made over
- Oh Lord, make me over
- Make me over
Make me over
Come on. Keep goin'!
- Oh Lord, make me over
- Make me over
Lord, make me nice
Lord, make me good
- And give me power
- Make me over
- Give me love
- Wanna be made over
- Give me voluptuousness
- Make me over
I wanna be made over
All right, bye-bye.
Hey. Hey, hey, Fross, Fross, tell them to be quiet.
Y'all look here.
We're fixin' to go on tour.
That's right, we're goin' on tour.
Which means my name's gonna be on this thing, which means any time you fuck up a step, you fuckin' with my good reputation, you understand?
Jackie, you was 15 minutes late to rehearsal today, wasn't you?
A $5 fine.
What you laughing at, Spider?
You ain't but that far from not even having a job your damn self.
All right, now. Y'all, look here.
It's gonna be Anna Mae's first run out the startin' gate.
I want all y'all to pitch in, help her out, do what you can, all right?
All right.
Yeah, hey, Lorraine!
- I'm tired of this shit, Ike.
- Lorraine.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now, now, come on, yeah.
We finally get paid, and he invents a new way to take it back.
And he want everybody to help her out.
He sure got a sudden case of the niceness.
Yeah, I wonder why.
I guess he caught it from that new swing in somebody's ass.
Come on. He's with Lorraine.
Lorraine! Oh, honey, please.
Lorraine was Ike's last gig.
He's always bookin' ahead.
Now, you watch yourself.
Ike's got a thing for every young heifer sticks her butt out.
- Yeah, you wish he did.
- Come on, Anna Mae. Let's go.
All right, in a sec, okay?
- Hey, now.
- I was...
Just about to go home, but I wanted to say good night.
Well, don't go nowhere yet. Come on.
Sit down and let me talk to you.
You know, you got the prettiest smile.
You do.
Come on. Open your mouth for me.
You ain't been to the dentist before, have you?
What?
I said, you ain't been to the dentist before, have you?
I'm gonna have Fross carry you to the dentist in the morning.
You got a lot of cavities back there.
All right?
All right.
It's kind of late for you to be goin' home.
I want you to stay here tonight.
I got a room in the back, it's all made up for you.
And don't you worry,
I'm gonna call your mama and let her know you're stayin' here, okay?
- All right.
- Why don't you go on back there.
Go on.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What the fuck is goin' on here?
Lorraine, don't. Please, don't.
You ain't even worth the bullet.
- Lorraine. Lorraine!
- What's the matter? Hey!
- Lorraine, Lorraine!
- Lorraine!
- Open the door! Open, open the door!
- Lorraine!
Lorraine! Anna Mae!
Anna Mae. Hey, Fross!
Hey, Fross, get up here, man!
Oh, shit! What happened?
- Hey, call an ambulance.
- You drove me to this, Ike!
I'll get an ambulance.
You, you stay with her.
- Ike, Jr., go back downstairs, now.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Watch him, Ike! Watch him!
Ike, come on. Let's go. We got to go.
How's Lorraine? Is she...
No, she's fine. She's gonna be all right.
Doctor says she gonna pull through just fine.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm gonna be okay.
Damn.
I can't stand hospitals, ma'am.
My daddy got holes kicked in his stomach.
Took him three long years to die.
And you could smell his insides.
'Cause he was messin' around with some gangster's woman.
Can't stand hospitals, ma'am.
I'm sorry.
I need to go.
Come on, Anna Mae.
Don't go nowhere now.
Don't leave me by myself.
I can't be by myself tonight.
- But, Lorraine, she's your wife.
- No, we ain't married.
We ain't never been married.
I just can't make her happy no more.
Things could change. I mean, maybe...
- Y'all can work it out.
- No.
She did the worst thing you could do to anybody like me.
She stopped believin' in me.
See, I got dreams, Anna Mae.
I got dreams that's bigger than St. Louis.
And she can't touch me like you do.
She don't make me feel the way you do.
I can't even talk to her.
You're the only one.
You're the onliest one
I could talk to like this.
Just like everybody else
I tried to help out my whole life, she done left me.
I wouldn't do that, what those other people did to you, leave you.
- I would never do that.
- I know.
- Never.
- I know.
Look, look.
Oh, shit.
Hey, look here, y'all.
I want y'all to take Anna down to this beauty shop here.
Get her a bleach job like Marilyn Monroe, like the lady on the poster up there.
Get her hair did like that, all right?
- Okay.
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, Marilyn.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Where?
- Right here. Come on. Let's go.
Hey, Anna Mae, what ya think, honey?
Is it me, girl?
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- Nothin'.
I just didn't think we'd be playin' in a place like this.
What, thought we'd be playin' at Carnegie fuckin' Hall?
From what I heard about Ike, baby, the shit's about to hit the fan.
Girl, now you know
Ike'll work the fuck out of you.
- Do I detect a note of bitterness?
- It's a gig.
And you know what they say about Ike.
Oh, child, don't mind me.
I'm just havin' a little fun.
Now, Anna Mae, what's that do doin' back there?
- It's lookin' kind of orange.
- No, it's supposed to look like that.
- Hey, you the singer?
- Yeah.
But you got to have more up there.
She'll get bigger the way she's been eatin'.
Yeah, Anna Mae, we scared to eat around ya.
Girl, your appetite done picked up lately.
I noticed that, too.
Noticed it?
Honey, Ray Charles could see it.
What?
Darlene!
Look what you did, girl.
Now look at that!
Now, you know you need an ass whoopin'!
Anna Mae.
Anna Mae, get your butt out here, girl!
Rock me, baby
Rock me all night long
Rock me, baby
I said I want you to
Rock me, baby
Rock me all night long
Rock me, baby

Then I want you to roll me, Daddy
Like you roll your flour dough
I want you to roll me, Daddy

Play my song.
Hey, little Ann, girl, you were slick!
Baby, you blew those people way out.
You were wonderful!
Girl, girl, I'll tell you! -
All right now.
Ike finds out Jack Daniels been dancin' with the Ikettes, you're gonna be in big trouble.
I ain't thinkin' about Ike.
Yeah, Jack better stop dancin' on my feet.
Whose idea was this? Darlene? Jackie?
Leanne, how come ain't nobody told me about this new look we got goin' on here?
- See, Ike...
- I like it! I like this!
I mean, this is perfect!
We're gonna keep this in the act.
We gonna make it part of the act from now on.
Now, we got 92 dates between here and a good night's sleep.
- So y'all know what y'all got to do, right?
- Yes.
Look here, Anna Mae.
You did real good out there tonight.
- Really, Ike?
- Yes, ma'am, you did real good.
Now I got this new song I'm writin'.
You keep singin' like you've been doin, and I might let you record it for me when we get in the studio. All right?
How 'bout that?
You like that?
Baby, look like you put on a few pounds there.
- Well...
- Wait, wait, wait. Now, now, it's all right.
I like that.
I like it when you're healthy like that.
Stop!
Come on, little man.
Smile for your daddy. Come on.
You know what?
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good-looking.
Come on. Smile.
Come on, Craig, come on.
Let the baby rest and the nurses, too.
Don't forget you heard that first on WTEX, lke and Tina Turner with Fool In Love.
I don't know even when y'all got time to make that record.
"Ockateena"? Who is that?
Ike and Tina!
Sounds like weddin' bells to me, baby.
Yeah, girl. The man gave you his name.
Tina! What kind of name is that?
What's the matter, baby, don't you like it?
Come on. It's like Sheena of the Jungle, gorgeous, sexy woman on God's green earth!
Sexy thing on God's green earth!
Go on, Ike, go on!
Hey, Doc, she lookin' kind of peaky.
What's wrong with her?
Well, she's quite ill.
We're looking at a severe case of anemia.
A who?
She needs rest, and I'm not releasing her.
Not for at least another three weeks.
No, no, no, not now.
I got a lot of dates booked between here and then.
I got San Antone. I got Austin.
No, no, Sam, we be talkin' about a lot of money here.
This is very serious, Mr. Turner.

You all right, little man?
Look here, darling, you're supposed to stay with your man.
Who you gonna listen to, a doctor who don't know me from Adam, don't know you from Eve?
- Or you gonna listen to your man?
- But, Ike, are you sure?
- I'm sure.
- But no, wait. Put me down.
Hold on, Anna Mae, hold on.
Look here, look here.
Come on, Little Ann,
I can't wait no longer.
Now?
Yeah, we'll go down to Mexico and get it done in a few hours.
No, I can't take my baby to Mexico.
Wait. Now hold on, now.
Alline downstairs in the car, hon.
Your mama can look after the baby while we're gone.
We'll go to Mexico, get it done in a few hours, and then we off to New York City.
New York? What's in New York?
We are, baby, you and me.

It's an advance from Sue Records for songs I ain't even wrote yet.
My, oh, my, I am a fool in love!
Yeah, we used to work without gettin' paid, now we get paid before we even work.
Anna Mae Bullock, you're priceless, girl. Priceless!
Yeah, yeah, she priceless, all right.
Shit, she ain't seen a dime of it yet.
Here, here, here, hand me that baby.
Give me Craig.
- Come on, Craig. Hey, he's sweet.
- Thanks, Mama.
Anna Mae, what you plannin' on doin' with all that money, honey?
Live better.
Ike wants a big house with a pool and I know he's always wanted his own recording studio.
Now, don't forget about those who helped you to get to where you are.
No, Ma. Never forget my blood.
I told you you're gonna get in trouble, messin' with other people's stuff.
Puttin' your hands where they don't belong...
Just playin' around.
What's wrong with you, girl?
Every time I turn my back, Ma.
Child, he's just bein' a man.
Don't be worryin' about him.
Don't be naggin' him now.
Look here, you got yourself a good man.
You just keep him happy.
- Ya hear?
- Yeah.
Go on. I got the baby.
No, honey, put 'em back on.
Give me my money, and put them glasses back on.
Shit! Damn! Hold on, baby, hold on.
I'll be right back.
Come on. Come on, come on!
All right, Lorraine,
I ain't got time for your mess now.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I hear you're playin' daddy?
You're playin' the family man!
- All right, let me finish this up.
- Ike, here they go.
They're yours.
Y'all say hello to your daddy.
Come here. Wait right here.
I'm gonna talk to your mama.
Don't go nowhere.
- Lorraine, come here.
- No.
Look here, now.
I told you about showin' up here and startin' this mess.
I'm not messin' with you.
What am I gonna do with two more kids?
What am I gonna do with two more kids, woman! Come back here!
Leave me alone, Ike!
You always wanna come around here and start some mess!
You better get your ass away from around here...
Don't fuck with me, Ike!
You better not never bring your ass around here again!
I said, don't fuck with me, Ike.
Come on, you guys take those on out.
What the hell am I gonna do with two more kids?
What am I gonna do with two more kids?
I saw you.
It's all right, it's okay.
- Hey, you ever been to California?
- No.
- No? Me, neither.
- We did not.
No? It's gonna be an adventure?
I saw you.
You wanna go inside and see what toys I packed up?
Yeah? All right. Come on.
I wanna see.
It's the cool sound of KAJT and here comes the hot sound of the British Invasion.
Manfred Mann and Do Wah Diddy.
Do wah diddy diddy Dum diddy do
Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet
Singin' do wah diddy diddy
Dum diddy do
- She looked good
- Looked good
- She looked fine
- Looked fine
She looked good, she looked fine and I nearly lost my mind
Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me
Singin' do wah diddy diddy
Dum diddy do
Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be
Singin' do wah diddy diddy
Dum diddy do
So what's your take on the new
English music invading the States?
Well, actually there ain't nothin' new about it.
It ain't nothin' but black music.
I mean, Negro music with an accent.
But, personally, I like a lot of it.
Ike, I sense you don't feel fully appreciated here?
Well, we have been doin' a lot of touring all over the country and Ike's been writin' a lot of great new songs.
Ike?
- Thank you.
- Sure. You're welcome.
Thank you.
Jackie! Jackie!
Hey, you motherfuckers, be quiet out there!
I'm tryin' to work, goddamn it!
I'll be right back.
I only wanna be with you
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
Ike, come on, come on, take a break with us.
What you talkin' about?
I ain't got no time.
I got to work. I got to write these songs.
Sue Records, motherfuckers been after me about these songs for six months.
You know how much money
I owe Sue Records?
What you mean, owe Sue Records?
As much as we work?
They always givin' you stacks of cash whenever we do a show and I know I don't spend it.
No? Well, what about all them wigs and wardrobe and whatnot you got in the back there?
What about the way you got this place decked out?
All this furniture, that fish tank.
The sofas, that fountain and shit.
That shit costs money, Anna Mae.
I got to pay the girls and I got to pay the band and on top of that,
I'm tryin' to build us a studio.
You know you want the studio.
And I'd have it by now if you would sing the songs the way I tell you to sing 'em, Anna Mae.
Goddamn.
That's what I've been tryin' to do, Ike.
But they all sound the same, you know?
What?
I ain't hear you. What you say?
I ain't hear you.
- I ain't hear you. What you say?
- I said...
I mean, not exactly, you know?
I mean, but you do have your own style.
My own style? What's wrong?
Ike, you promised you wouldn't hit me.
Don't hit me, please!
- Seems like you wanna fight.
- No, no!
Where you goin'?
Come here. Here we go.
- No!
- Here we go?
Ike, no! No!
Ike, please!
Please! Stop!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Stop it!
- Get in here! Shut the fuck up!
- Ike, please!
No!
I guess you gonna leave me now?
Go on then.
Now keep your behind in there, hear?
Everything all right.
Me and your mama just talkin'. Go on.
Y'all, go on!
I said, go!
Anna.
No, no, no.
I'm all right. I'll be out in a second.
Somebody needs to slap his ass around.
Thank you.
He just got a lot of worries right now, but I know he's sorry.
Is he sorry for all the other times, too?
- He's a pig!
- Don't do that, Jackie.
Don't do that.
Can't nobody understand that he got a lot of pressure right now?
Money. Music ain't right.
This, that and the other thing, and what do I do?
I insult him when I know he try.
No, Anna. Look, this has got to stop.
You can't keep hiding black eyes from us pretending like nothing's happening.
We know.
I know what I gotta do.
I'm gonna help get it back on track and then things between me and him gonna get better.
Thank you.
Now your last few songs haven't quite reached the all-time popularity of Fool In Love, but you're still going strong.
It must be difficult to be such a busy performing couple.
How do you do it?
Well, Ike's always busy writin' songs, touring, everything.
And me, I'm just a homebody.
I love cookin', cleanin', takin' care of the boys.
So between the two of us, it just works out.

Tina? Mr. Spector would like to have a word with you.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Turner.
Thank you.
Your performance was wild.
Hey, Phil Spector.
I didn't know you was a fan.
Look here, anything you got to say to her, you can say to me.
All right then.
I'd like to record a song with her.
Hey, y'all hear that?
Phil Spector want to record with Ike and Tina.
All right!
I'd like to record a song with Tina.
All right then.
Look here. Come on in my office.
Let me talk to you about that here.
When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way
I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger
In every way
And it gets deeper
Let me say
And it gets higher
Day by day
And do I love you
My, oh my
Yeah, river deep mountain high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you, baby
Baby, baby, baby
When you were a young boy did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down
'Cause it goes on and on
Like a river flows
And it gets bigger, baby
And heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby
As it grows
And do I love you
My, oh my

- I don't want any.
No, none for me.

- I feel good.
She should feel good with a hit song on her hands.
Could I have your autograph,
Miss Turner?
That's Mrs. Turner.
That's a married woman you're talkin' to, boy.
So when are you gonna make another single, Mrs. Turner?
Who knows, you know?

Jackie, what... I don't know what...
I don't know what I'm saying.
It sounds...
I know, I know, I know.
It feels strange, but it's chanting.
I'm a Buddhist now.
And when you chant, Anna, you can see things clearly.
It's like life's mirror.
And when you can see yourself clearly, you can change anything.
Come on.
You want to try it with me?

Hey, Ann, I want you to wake me up an hour before the sound check, hear?
Anna Mae Bullock, you hear me?
You hear what I said?

Is there anything else you want me to do for you, baby?
Go on in there and clean yourself up.
Ike?
Miss Turner?
I need to speak with your manager.
Yes, ma'am. Right away. George.
I'm... I'm Tina Turner.
My husband and I just had a fight.
I'm supposed to open at the Academy tonight.
I have 36 cents and a Mobil card, but if you would give me a room,
I swear I will pay you back.
- No, no, no. That won't be necessary.
- Take these.
Now, Miss Turner,
I'd be honored. Really.
We'll take care of you.
Thank you.
Nick.
Let's give Ms. Turner a room.
Thank you.
People keep asking me where I'm hidin' my investments.
Because he's right.
The only investments I got, she done destroyed.
The Ike and Tina Turner Revue, that was my investment.
Ike, Jr.! Ike, Jr.!
We couldn't play all the dates I booked.
People are mad at me all over the country.
$750,000 she done cost me.
What I got left: I got some clothes,
I got some jewelry.
The rest I got tied up in investments.
I ain't got nothin' else.
Please instruct your client to remove his sunglasses. This is a courtroom.
Well... You ain't got to instruct me to do nothin'.
Your Honor, in order to expedite this matter, my client would like to make an oral motion amending her petition for divorce, revoking any financial claims.
I want you to be very sure about this.
It means you're going to walk out of here with absolutely nothing.
Except my name.
I'll give up all that other stuff, but only if I get to keep my name.
I worked too hard for it, Your Honor.
The name is mine.
The name got my daddy's blood on it.
Now she want to go...
She can go wherever she want to go, but the name belong to me.
No, no, look here now. Hey, hey, hey, get your hand off me, man.
Mr. Turner. Sir?
Now, look, if she want to go, she can go.
That's fine.
She can go, but the name stays home.
As Mrs. Turner has decided to drop all claims,
I hereby grant her divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.
Mr. Turner will retain all publishing rights, royalties, all real property, clothing, jewelry and all other assets.
Mrs. Turner will retain the use of her stage name.
We did it, Mama. We did it.
Anna Mae Bullock! See, you ain't know that was her name. Hey!
That's all right. I'm gonna talk to her.
Yeah, you keep the name, Anna Mae.
You keep the name. But remember who gave it to you? I did!
That's right, I gave it to you!
What you gonna do?
You got four grown boys.
Yeah, carry your country ass back to Nutbush!
No, it's all right, man. It's all right.
All right, sonny.
Come on now. Let's go.
Ike, Jr., come on. We goin' home now.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to San Francisco, and welcome to the Fairmont Hotel.
This marvelous truffle salad and lovely chicken, prepared specially this evening.
Oh, my God. Roger Davies came.
I really want this manager to sign me. I'm so nervous.
We are very, very happy tonight to have an old-time favorite.
"Old-time?" Old...
Miss Tina, of lke and Tina Turner Revue.
Go get 'em, Grandma.
- Yes! Oh, baby!

I don't want to see the show if I have to pay extra.

- No, ma'am.
- No, that's how they get you.
Burn, baby, burn

One hundred stories high
People gettin' loose now
Gettin' down on the roof

I heard somebody say burn, baby, burn
Disco inferno
- Burn, baby, burn

Burn, baby, burn
You see, Ike... Ike was straight R&B.
You know? My baby done left me...
Took all my money, cut up my clothes.
I'm standing here naked. I'm so sad.
But I ain't about the blues anymore, you know?
Well, what are you about?
- Rock and roll. Yeah!
- Yeah?
Rock and roll.
That's right.
I'm talkin' about the energy of it.
Fun stuff, you know. You hear it in the music of, like, Bowie and Jagger.
You know, that's the stuff I wanna do.
Not that old sad-sack stuff
I used to do with Ike and not this boring stuff
I have to do for these hotels.
You know, rock and roll is for young people.
It's a very different audience to what you'd be used to with Ike.
I just believe that anything is possible.
You know? Anything.
Now it took me a long time to get Ike out of my system...
And now that I've done that, I'm ready.
I'm ready, and I know what I want.
Tina, cheers.
To you.
- To us.
- To us.
- I'll see you tomorrow, noon.
- Noon?
- Yes. No, you need to come in early.
- You said 1:00.
Hey, Tina, between you and Roger, how do you expect us to get any rest?
I'll just stay up till then.
Good night, fellas.
Hello, Anna Mae.
Hey, look, I...
Look, I just wanna talk to you now.
Give me a few minutes of your time.
No. I don't think so, Ike.
Come on, Ann. Now hold on.
Look, I brung you something.
I brung a gift for ya. Hold on.
Look here. You're gonna like this.
Yeah, you gonna like this.
Look here.
Come on. I brung 'em for ya.
Now, go on and take 'em.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Now, I'm...
Look, I just need to talk to you a couple, two, three minutes, all right?
All right?
I'm not gonna make it.
I need to talk to somebody. Please.
All right. Two minutes.
There you go.
Okay. Okay, two minutes. Two minutes.
Goddamn, girl. You look good!
Thanks.
What is that you got on?
You smell good.
- Look, Ike...
- All right, all right, all right.
What is this about?
Well, the record company tryin' to put me in jail.
Talkin' about I owe them all kind of money, and I got to do somethin'.
Well, you do, Ike. I mean, you took a lot of advance money, and you didn't make good on it.
Yeah, well, look here,
I know all that, but...
See, if I could just get me another hit record, now I'd be all right.
They'd get off my back and give me some slack.
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Look, I've been writing some songs.
Yeah, I have.
And I wrote this one song. It's called...
Goddamn, I forgot the name of it.
Anyway, look here, I wrote it for you.
And it's got...
I mean, it's a beautiful love song.
It's got that real nice slow groove everybody listen to now.
And every time I hear it, it remind me of us.
I got my own band now, you know.
I got my own songs.
But a lot of that stuff you do in there, there ain't nobody gonna buy that.
I mean, maybe somebody gonna buy it, but it ain't like you and me.
I mean, when we was together, our thing was... Like this here.
Look, I really got to go.
Just hold on a second, will ya?
I got one more thing I wanna say to you.
Look, I been doin' a lot of thinkin' and...
Two minutes.
All right, now! Look...
Goddamn it, I miss you, Ann.
I'm tired of this.
This done gone on long enough, and I want you to come home now.
I know everything between us wasn't...
Look, everybody got problems, Ann.
I'm tryin' to take care of mine.
I gave up that narcotic.
I'm just... Look, I'm tellin' you right here and right now,
I'm gonna try and do right by you this time.
- Bye, Ike.
- Bye? Wait a minute!
I ain't through talkin' to you yet now.
You think about this: I made you.
You wasn't nothin' without me, and you ain't gonna be nothin' without me.
I was wonderin' when old Ike Turner was gonna show up.
You get on. Do your la-di-da thing.
Go ahead.
Yeah, all right. Lay it on.
You ain't Donna Summer.
I'm gonna see you again, Ann.
Goddamn it.
You done broke my window.
Look what you done did now.
You messed up a nice automobile.
That's all right.
I'm gonna take care of that.
This shit ain't over, Anna Mae.
You can believe this shit ain't over.
I'm a soul survivor
Soul survivor
Okay, well, it's very exciting.
We've booked the Ritz in New York City.
One of the reasons for doing this showcase at the Ritz is that a lot of these people, a lot of these doubters can come along and see how exciting this new stuff really is and how, how focused she really is at the moment.
In Buddhism, we do a chant called "Nam myoho renge kyo" and what that signifies is that everything in our life is cause and effect.
If there's anything within you that needs to be changed, you do it.
You change it.
Can Tina Turner really make a comeback at age 44?
- Forty-three! Here.
- What? Thank you.
Tell 'em to get it straight.
- Who is it?
- About time he turned up.
Ike, Jr., Mother.
Hey.
What happened?
Who did this to you, Junior?
Father. He freaked out.
He kicked me out of the house.
Jackie. Come on in here.
Get me something to clean him up with, please.
- Yeah, yeah.
- What happened?
Turn that off, please. Come on. Ronnie.
Listen. I don't want you goin' back over there, all right?
I want you to stay with me.
Ma, there's something you should know.
I mean, he's been sayin' crazy stuff.
I mean, anybody mention you or the show at the Ritz, he just go nuts.
He go nuts. He said you ain't gonna walk out on that stage.
- That man has got a hit out on you.
- Thank you, Jackie.
Listen, Junior. Don't you think about that. You hear me?
I'm sorry. I know it hurts.
Mama, he wants to hurt you.
He's gonna hurt you.
I don't know what he's gonna do.
Come here.
I'm sorry. I know it hurts.
Nam myoho renge kyo.
- Five minutes, Miss Turner.
- Okay, thank you.
All right, now, listen. I'm going out the front. See you after the show.
- Okay. All right.
- All right. All right.
Roger?
Thanks.
Good luck?
Okay.
Yeah, come in.
Damn, who died?
You got enough flowers in here for a funeral?
How'd you get in here, Ike?
What do you want?
Hey, it's a big night for little Anna Mae.
I come to see the show just like everybody else.
How'd you get past security?
Oh, come on, now.
You know me better than that.
Now look here, I told you.
I told you it wasn't over.
I told you you was gonna see me again.
Here I am, big and bold as shit.
You didn't even believe me. Thought you was gonna get away from me.
Thought a nigger like me was gonna let you get away from me?
You can't get away from me, Ann.
I'm in here.
Now you gonna act like you don't even know me.
Yeah, I know you, Ike.
- I know you real well, all right?
- All right, Ann.
You know me so well, tell me what I'm gonna do now.
Come on. I can't hear you.
You ain't got all that mouth now.
Come on. Tell.
- Talk to me, Ann. I can't hear you.
- That supposed to scare me?
Oh, yeah.
What you gonna do? I don't know.
Do what you wanna do, Ike. I don't care.
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do.
I got a roomful of people who've come to see me.
You hear me, Ike? Come to see me.
So what do you wanna do? I don't know.
Shoot me?
Pistol-whip me?
Yeah, Tina!
Here she is in her first solo performance at the Ritz...
Ladies and gentlemen, Tina Turner!
You must understand
Though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that
Oh, oh what's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a secondhand emotion?
What's love got to do got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me
Oh, oh what's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a secondhand emotion?
What's love got to do got to do with it?
I've been taking on a new direction
And I have to say
I've been thinkin' about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh, oh, what's love
Got to do
I said got to do with it?
What's love but a secondhand emotion?
What's love got to do got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
- What's love
- Got to do got to do with it?
- What's love
- What's love
But a secondhand emotion?
What's love
Got to do
I say got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Like the light in your eyes
The one I build my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me I'm gettin' stronger
We must stop pretending
I can't live this lie
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talkin', babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
I hear a whisper in the air
That simply doesn't bother me
Boy, can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me
- It seems to me that lately
- Seems to me that lately
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
- Could it be that maybe
- Could it be that maybe
This crazy situation is the reason why
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talkin', babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We have to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
Oh, don't wanna hurt no more
But, baby, don't you know
No, I don't wanna hurt no more
Too much talkin', babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
Tired of all these games
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
This time I'm walkin', babe
So let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

50 guineas.
That's cheap.
Hey, don't let it go to your head.
It might be 10 years before you sell another one.
Van Gogh never sold a picture in his life.
50 fucking guineas.
Yes!
I like the blonde, but
I prefer the brunette.
Yeah, but blondes have more fun.
Who says?
Swedes.
It's got to look good.
You'll get her for 50, you know.
Liverpool.
Home of...
Liverpudlians.
You know what
I like about Liverpool,
Mr. Sutcliffe?
No, what is it you like about Liverpool,
Mr. Lennon?
I was hoping you'd tell me.
I know what Arthur's gonna say.
He's gonna say, "I gave you chance.
"I put a brush in your hand.
"I went out on a limb for you
"and you're gonna toss it away
"to go and play bass in
John Lennon's skiffle band."
It's not a skiffle band.
He's gonna say...
It's a rock and roll band.
"I opened the doors for you..."
It's not my band.
Yeah, that's what he'll say.
It's a group.
We're a group.
We're in it together.
He's gonna shit himself.
I like Arthur.
You know, he's all right.
But he thinks art's something you gotta hang on the wall in a pool of light.
It's a disease with him.
He thinks it's all about Van Gogh.
Ah, nothing wrong with Van Gogh.
Oh, no, I had a word with Van Gogh.
Did ya?
Bumped into him the other night in The Grapes.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I said, "Vincent, mate, where did it all go wrong?"
You know what he said?
Been meaning to tell you this.
No, what did he say?
He said, "If I could do it all again,
"I'd be up there shaking me bum
"doing Blue Suede Shoes.
"It's all dick," that's what he said.
I gave him your regards.
Ah, thanks.
You're a painter, Stu.
You are the best I've got.
I'm coming back.
And it's a pisser to throw it away, man
I'm not throwing anything away.
You know, you could teach me a damn sight more than I could ever teach you.
Arthur, I'm 19 years old.
I've got me whole life.
And where's it gonna get you?
Hamburg for a start.
Take it easy, mate.
Get it up there.
Hey.
It's a bit rough out there.
Ah, it's nothing, that, mate.
Bit of a swell, that's all.
You call that a swell?
I call it mother's milk.
My dad was a sailor and his dad before him.
I'm the son of a son of a sailor.
Bollocks.
Mum, Mum!
Here.
What is it?
Scones.
Scones!
I've made you some scones.
Mum, they've got food on the ferry, you know.
I know.
They haven't got my scones.
I can't take scones.
If the lads knew you'd given me scones
I'll never hear the end of it.
I'm in a rock and roll group, Mum.
So have you ever been abroad before?
Overseas, like.
Oh, aye, yeah.
Yeah, I've been to the Isle of Wight.
I'll write.
You'd better.
Oh, every day.
Every minute, every second.
Now and then would be a start.
Oh, you're a tough negotiator, Miss Powell.
Come on, George, we're starving.
There's food on the ferry.
Where are those lovely little scones your mother made?
All right, lads.
See you soon.
Shall we?
Is that right, pal?
You did say your father was a sailor?
You did say the sea was in your blood, didn't you?
Sorry, I missed that.
I said...
Oh, ugh!
You horrible filth.
I do believe I'm feeling a shade better now, cap'n, thank you.
But I do believe the captain's trod on me parrot, sir.

Yeah, well, what about Stu?
He just stands there.
Paul, I know you can play bass better than he can, we all know that.
But what Stu plays is just right.
It's rock and roll.
He's the greatest rock and roller there is.
Listen, I know he's great.
But all he does is stand there.
It's the way he stands.

No.

'Course it is.
It's nothing, I was just doing a test for the lighting.
You don't say much, do you?
Drummers don't talk.
You must have noticed that.
Just might as well be deaf and dumb, drummers.
I mean, when was the last time you heard a drummer say anything?
See?
You know why, don't you?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause nobody ever fucking listens.
It's all dick.
I could do with another Henry.
It's all dick, all this.
You're just dressed up just to be noticed, don't you?
You just do it to impress, that's all.
Is that so terrible?
Just to be noticed?
It's all bollocks, that.
End of the day it's all down to dick, eh?
So why don't we just fucking say it for a change?
I mean, never mind all the talk, never mind all the fucking bollocks.
At the end of the day all everybody wants is a bit of fucking dick.
Is he always like this?
Why don't we just say it, eh?
Why are you doing this?
I mean, a bit of dick never hurt anyone, did it?
Bit of dick never led to war.
He thinks you're out of his league.
It's liars that lead to war.
Liars and hypocrites.
He thinks if he tried to pull you you might laugh at him and that would hurt.
You trying to impress, you all are.
Everybody trying to impress everybody else.
I used to do it, the same thing.
I used to do it when I was about 15.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, well I've given up trying, mate.
You're never gonna shag her, Stu, get that into your head right now.
She's here with her fucking boyfriend, you understand?
I don't have to get down on my hands and knees... and try to impress!
- He's sorry he's doing this.
I'm not sorry!
You should be.
I'm telling the truth.
It's the fucking truth, lad!
I'm telling you the truth!
You haven't got the balls to chat her up, John, so you're having a dig.
That's what it's all about.
That's the fucking truth.
You haven't got the balls because you think she's out of your league.
That's what hurts, mate, isn't it?
She's out of your fucking league.

Bollocks, Stu!
Thank you.
Hey, John, slow down.
He's jealous.
You think so?
You hurt his feelings.
He'll get over it.
So did you shag her, then?
She's a photographer.
Klaus designs record covers.
You'll never shag her.
Not her, not Astrid.
Not with all that lot.
You know that, don't you?
You haven't got a hope.
She's a photographer.
You'd like her if you gave yourself the chance.
She wants to take our photograph.
She can photograph my arse, mate.

Hello.
Everybody is talking about you.
What are they saying?
They are saying that you are in a band down on the Reeperbahn.
They say that you are quite fantastic.
Klaus is quite wild about this music.
But he did not tell us that you are so beautiful.
Is he your boyfriend?
Klaus?
I've known Klaus all my life.
We have been lovers since we were born.
Fuckin' hell.
It's great.
It's fucking great.
Good evening, ladies and genitals.
Right, we're gonna do a little request.
Stu is going to sing youse a song.
Now, we don't normally do requests, but it's Stu's request and if we don't let him do it, he'll only wet the bed.

He took one look, you know why?
Yeah, I know why.
You know why, don't you?
Yeah, because we were shite.
Because we were shite, that's why.
Because we're supposed to be a rock and roll group, not a fucking charity show.
Well, fuck him.
Listen, John, this group can't carry Stu.
You know that, don't you?
We're not that good.
You want him out.
That's not, that's not what I said!
Listen, you.
If Stu goes, I go, do you understand that?
No, you won't.

You can't do your solo spot anymore, Stu.

So, tomorrow we will make a record.
Yes?

- Yeah.
Tomorrow?
You have something better to do?
It is a backing record.
Maybe it will not be such a great record, but it goes round and round.
Oh, it'll be great.
Don't you worry about that.
I don't care what it is.
I don't care if it's Polly
Put the fucking Kettle On.
It'll be great because it's us, you see, this band.
It's us.
What he's saying is we'll be there.
Yeah, I'm saying we'll be there.
Oh, yeah, we'll be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Wouldn't we, Paul?
We're gonna be big, Sutcliffe.
You know that, don't you?

We're gonna be too big for Hamburg.

I like red, a lot of red.
Do you know why they roll out the red carpet for the King and Queen?
They don't roll out a blue carpet or a green carpet.

What's that?
I love you in German.
Only in German?
Any way you wish.
You've read all these?
Of course not.
No, but you like to read, though, don't you?
You're a big reader.
One or two.
Yeah, a big thinker.
You like all that, don't you, theory?
Sartre and all that lot,
Cocteau and all his lot, all that Left Bank shower.
All those little bohemians sitting round drinking Chateau Spazzo and listening to Edith Piaf.
You don't like Edith Piaf?
Oh, she's all right, Edith Piaf, but she's an old woman, isn't she?
She's got one foot in the grave.
I could never love anyone who didn't love Edith Piaf.
You know my theory about art?
Did I ever tell you that?
It's all dick?
Exactly.
I wonder makes you so...
So what?
Such an asshole.
Practice.
You are the angriest person I have ever met.
What makes you so angry?
I'm not angry.
I would like to be your friend.
You would like to be my friend, but you cannot behave like a friend to me.
You deny me.
You deny yourself.
It helps nobody.
Nobody's any happier.
It's such a waste of time.
Why don't I let you into a little secret, just between the two of us?
I'm not angry, sister.
I'm fucking desperate.
I think you're jealous.
Jealous?
Oh, yeah, jealous.
Jealous of who?
Jealous of Stu?
Jealous of me.
Hey, hey, Gestapo.
The police.
Knock, knock.
What's going on, then?
Pontoon.
We're being deported.
He says George is underage.
No, no, no, you can't do that, mate.
You can't do this.
Tell him he can't do this, we're a group.
You're a group?
Tell him!
What?
So you're still a group.
You wouldn't pull me leg.
It really is the showers you're taking us to, isn't it, Mr. Goebbels?
You will come back?
I'll write.
I don't like letters.
I'll write anyway.
I have to see your eyes when you talk to me.
You don't have to open them.
You can throw them in a drawer, when I come back we can open them, have a laugh.
Don't you have something to say to me?
I love you in German.
Only in German?
Anywhere, anyhow, anytime.
So I give you back.
Bye.

"And big indiscreet trees threw out
"their leaves against the pane: cunningly, and close,

I've been reading these poems.
Rimbaud.
He's French.
I know Rimbaud.
You should read them.
A Season in Hell.
He was in a lot of pain.
Should be right up your street.
He was a queer.
He'd fuck anything that threw a shadow.
Sheep, goats.
He was possessed.
That's what Astrid said.
I met a fellow in Hamburg, didn't tell you this.
He was from the art school, his name's Paolozzi.
I let him have a look at some of me stuff, some of the paintings I was doing.
I'll go and see him when we get back.
What do you mean go and see him?
See if he'll take me on, some kind of grant.
What about the band, Stu?
I've got to get back there, John.
I haven't done a stroke since I left.
Band or no band, I've got to get back there.
She thinks I'm queer, Astrid.
Bollocks.
You heard her.
She thinks I fancy you.
That's not what she said.
What she said was she thinks we love one another.
And what did you say?
I might have grunted.
What's the odds?
It's all dick.

Sixteen!
Seventeen!
Eighteen!

Half the time he doesn't turn up and when he does he's in the fifth dimension.
Well, I'm not having it.
It's a waste of fucking time.
I've told you before,
Paul, I won't tell you again.
If you kick Stu out of this band I'll go with him.
No, you won't.
You fucking won't and
I'll tell you why, sailor, because you know how good we can be.
Not without me.
And you're not gonna kiss it goodbye.
Oh, just watch me, mate.
What is then?
What is it between you two?
What is it?
Yeah, what's going on?
Are you saying I'm a queer?
Is that what you're saying?
Oh, look.
Are you saying I'm a fucking fairy, is that what you're saying, Paul?
That's not what I said, that's not what I said.
What is it, that's what you said.
He never said that.
What is it between us, that's what you said!
He never said you were a fairy.
For Christ's sake!
Will you just leave it alone?
He spoke.
You can't blame Paul, he's had enough.
You act like you're not interested anymore.
I'm not.
Bollocks.
I'm not gonna play in a rock and roll band for the rest of me life.
Paul is, you are.
It's what you want.
Found something better, have you?
I'll let you know.
I'm going to find out.
Calls for a drink, eh?
I've gotta go, mate.
Stu, she's just a girl.
All right, she's quite a girl, she's got a bit of je ne sais fucking quoi.
She swept you off your feet.
At the end of the day she's just another shag.
She's having a bit of fun with ya.
She's a collector, she hasn't finished with you yet.
She'll get bored.
You don't know her.
She'll get tired and then she'll throw you back where you came from.
You don't know me very well either.
She'll get rid of you, she'll finish with you like she did to Klaus.
She's gonna do it to you, too!
She will!
Fuck you!
She'll fucking do it to you!
Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you.
He knows War and Peace word by word.

You don't need to say anything.
Calls for a drink.
You can do it.
Stuart!
Klaus!
This has happened to you how many times?
I don't know.
A couple.
I'm in a band.
We play eight days a week.
It can give you a headache.
Hmm.
A blow to the head.
You have had such a blow?
Who hasn't?
Hmm.
It was the pills, the speed.
I'll lay off the speed.
Yeah, do so, Mr. Sutcliffe.
And also do this:
Slow down.
Take your time.
Life is long.
You must not be in too much of a hurry.
Well?
What did he say?
You want the truth?
Please.
He said I should find a nice German girl and ask her to marry me.
That's absurd.
I think I've got something to offer.
Got a long way to go, I know that.

Tell me something, John Lennon.
When you are rich and famous, when you are number one, when your name is in lights and everybody wants to be your friend, when somebody asks you do you remember Astrid in Hamburg, what will you say?
I'll say she was the girl I always wanted.
The girl of me dreams.
Like Brigitte Bardot with better manners.
I might have fallen in love with her, but she fell in love with me best friend and that was the end of that.
I love him, John.
I do.
Yeah.
Don't we all?
Paul can play bass.
Paul can play bass a lot better than I can.
He can sing a lot better, too.
He's a bit flat, you know.
You don't need me, John.
You never did.
Yeah, but it was our band, wasn't it?
You and me, Stu.
No.
It was your band, yours and Paul's.
We're going to be big, you know that, don't you?
You'll miss it, Stu.
You're going to kick yourself.
We've got them by the throat, Stu.
You're going to be here in Hamburg.
It's what I want.
It's where I want to be.
There goes Stuart Sutcliffe.
That's what they'll say.
He could have been in the Beatles.
There goes Stu Stutcliffe.
He fell in love with a German girl.
He could have been in the Beatles, but he never really learned how to play.

Okay, come on!
This is to see whose king of the flat once and for all, okay?
The winner gets to kiss me.
Ready...
Go!
Poona Flat - January 14, 1969
Peter you're not trying, push!
What'd you let go for?
You can kiss me now.
No that wasn't fair.
Now we'll have to go with our left hands.
You hear that?
What?
I don't know, some sort of music or something
I don't hear anything.
Aren't you gonna kiss me?
No I gave ya one this morning.
I'm not a kissing machine.
I've been through a lot of interesting places
But I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of visiting...
Poona Flat.
My name is Billy Cross.
If you don't mind, we'd like to play something for you.
Did you like the music?
It was the best thing I ever heard.
What's your name?
John Anderson.
You ever tried music, John?
You should try one day...
You seemed tuned into us, John.
Gotta go now John.
Before they take off and leave me.
Nice meeting you.
Mr. Cross, wait!
If you ever come to Paris, look me up.
Did ya get his autograph?
Looks like we got our work cut out for us, Des.
He's been educated.
Come on boy.
What do you reckon?
Seems as good a place as any...
Back up.
Come on.
You sent that letter to Billy Cross yet?
Yep.
Johnny'd think he had all his birthdays at once if he got a message from his idol.
With Archie working at the post office
I'm always suprised a letter gets anywhere.
Don't know if I ever explained to you about the educated dog.
I came across one today.
Sometimes a trap is too sharp or a dingo is left too long, and it chews through its leg to get away.
Three legged dogs are the worst kind.
Because they're too smart to get trapped again... and too slow to go after anything but sheep.
I hope you like the tape that comes with this letter.
Daddy's home!
How's my girls?
Hi dad!
How are ya?
How do you like that? A supporting act from a dog.
Nevermind, they'll be back for dinner.
Put me down! Watch the post!
You kids take your time out there!
Johnny?
Come out here.
Coming.
Come on, what are you doing in there?
Nothing.
Sorry to interrupt but there's someone here to see you.
Don't you remember Peter?
You don't look too rich.
Not as rich as I'd like to be.
I wonder how much he's changed.
Y'know some of those boats he sells cost more than a million dollars.
You ever wondered... what would've happened if you married him instead of me?
You have?
Of course.
You know,
I can't imagine you swanning around those cocktail parties, drinking champagne, eating fish eggs.
You'd be bored in a month.
A month can be a very long time.
What's wrong?
- You did that on purpose.
- No I didn't!
Let me see, let me see.
I'll kiss it better.
Darling, when I sell one of my songs, you'll be swimming in champagne.
I'd settle for a new washing machine.
Whatever you want.
Heard that before.
And you've always believed me.
Sort of the ideal family car isn't it?
- Hey Norma!
- Hey Dingo!...
They're very good considering none of them have had proper training.
What sort of music do you play?
A bit of everything really. A cross between country and western, rock and roll, folk, blues, jazz...
What, no Mozart?
We don't get many requests for him actually.
Yeah boys, you like it!?
They're called Dingo and the Dusters.
Yeah, and I'm Dingo.
That was one of the worst...
No, that was the worst thing I've ever heard.
She'll be right on the night.
In my bloody oath she'll be right.
Because I'm not standing up here, making a fool of myself while the rest of you learn how to play.
And I told you to tune that damn thing!
If you don't wanna play, we'll find someone else who does.
Johnny, it's not that bad.
We'll fix him.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Stop it, you'll scare the neighbours.
I was in the backyard a few years ago, chopping wood.
A splinter flew up and hit me in the eye.
Jane took me to see the eye doctor.
He was on the end of his district run.
He was telling me about a case he'd had a few weeks earlier.
Well this bloke came in with a big piece of jagged metal wedged in his eye.
The doc asked him what had happened and he reckoned that he and a friend had been in the bush.
His friend was chopping wood.
This bloke said that, what had happened, was a piece of the axe head had broken off and come up and hit him in the eye.
The doc didn't believe him though.
Was something strange about the metal.
Didn't look manufactured.
So he took it to get it analysed.
Y'know what it was?
No, what?
A piece of meteor.
Must've been about the unluckiest bloke on earth.
And you believe that?
Yeah, why not?
Shit!
Clever bastard.
Maybe he'll get hit by a meteor.
Would save me a lot of grief.
Johnny, you know how you had those dreams of going to Paris and playing with Billy Cross...
What happened to that?
That's all you ever talked about.
I stil think about it.
Sometimes when I'm practicing,
I go to Paris.
I can see myself on a stage in some nightclub playing next to him.
Johnny, you're a dreamer.
You always were and always will be.
- Think so?
- Yep.
I'll tell you something I never told anyone else before not even Jane.
I've been saving money ever since that concert on the runway.
I keep it stashed under my cot, locked up in the caravan.
It's my Paris money.
How much you got?
More than 3000 dollars, got a passport too.
See, all the time I've been saving.
And I always figured, If I kept saving, there's always a chance I might go.
Now Jane's thinking of sending the girls off to school so...
That's that one gone.
But what I reckon is, I can filter it back in, slowly over the months, she'd never know I was holding out.
You'd be losing a fortune just in interest.
Why don't you just put it in the bank.
Can't do that mate.
Why not?
Jane is good friends with the bank manager, I'd get caught.
Gotta be smart.
You wanna know the last thing my father said to me, just before I left?
He said boy, the grass is no greener anywhere else.
I thought you would've sold this place after your father died.
I had this idea of fixing it up a bit and bringing Tom and Lydia out here.
It'd take a fair bit of fixing.
Feels funny seeing you walking around out here.
After reading about you in the papers.
I read about your boat,
I've seen photos of you and Lydia at society functions.
Does Lydia work?
She manages an estate agency.
She's very pretty..
She left me Jane, just went off with this other guy.
Oh Peter, I'm sorry.
I wonder, you know, what it would've been like if I'd stayed here.
- Would you have married me?
- Might not have asked me.
But if I did?
I guess we'll never know, will we.
Here, I'll give you a push.
Oh!
I hope you build your yachts better than you build your swings.
Peter!
I'm sorry.
I guess we were better at that as kids.
As I recall, you used to run a mile.
Beer thanks, Les.
How ya going?
What's up with you?
I did it.
I did it.
I finally bloody did it!
I bloody did it!
Congratulate me, I sold one!
I bloody got one!
- You beauty!
- What are ya talking about?
What am I talking about?
Feast your eyes on this boy, go on.
Nice loud voice, listen to this.
"Dear Mr. Anderson,
"Loved your latest tune.
"Most original and exciting music we've heard in a long time.
"Contract stuff, fellow. Congratulations.
"Jacques Boulain."
- Isn't that the agent you've been writing?
- That's the one.
That's great, Dingo!
Congratulations.
Can't bloody believe it.
Well Dingo, never believed you until now but seeing is believing, congratulations mate.
I tell ya it's the happiest bloody day of my life.
Wait until I tell Jane and the girls.
Drinks are on me, as much as you can hold.
Very kind of you, Dingo.
Hold on a minute, he's only buying for the band.
No, fuck it, drinks for everybody.
Dingo Anderson's the name.
Look for it at your local record shop!
You better be careful, you don't wanna be spending all your money.
Don't worry about that mate, it's spent.
Have a look at this!
How'd you pay for all that?
Pay for it? Put it on credit.
Wait til you see this.
Let's get outta here.
There you go mate, no hard feelings.
Do you like it?
Well yeah.
Do you really like it!?
- Yeah!...
- Right!
Now let's do some drinking.
Where's the boys?
Look, you better take this back.
Take it back!? No mate, it's all yours, no more excuses.
Come on everyone, back inside!
Holy shit, he's here.
Ruth, lock all the doors.
Didn't I tell you I'd get you a new washing machine?
You're gonna have to take the whole lot back.
I didn't steal it, I bought it.
Archie and the boys made the telegram up.
It's just a rotten joke, Johnny.
They meant no harm.
Bullshit. Hang on, listen, they couldn't have. I've got it here, look.
Read that.
No you read it.
No go on, I can't see. Uh,
"Dear Mr. Anderson..."
Ruth's been over. Archie's very sorry.
He didn't think you'd quite take it this far.
Got out of hand, John.
You mean it?
Yeah it was just a joke.
Sorry darling.
I'm dead.
It would serve you bloody right.
He started it.
Just keep him outside til he cools off.
He's really mad.
I hope you've learnt something out of this.
Just shut up.
Come on, if you don't open it
I'll break it down.
Archie!
Archie knows he went too far, and he's willing to pay for the drinks.
You didn't have to buy for everybody in town!
You can't stay up there forever.
You brought it on yourself.
The way you were showing off for your rich friend. We're just a bush band we're never gonna get any better.
We just like playing, that's all.
How did we know you were gonna buy all that stuff?
I'm warning you Archie, you ever do anything like that again,
I'll punch your face in.
Hey, Dingo.
Thanks for the guitar.
Watch where you're going.
I was already headed this way!
No you weren't, you turned!
Sunday driver!
Put those bicycles away, they gotta go back.
We're not hurting them.
You heard me! Wake your father up, tell him dinner's ready.
Dinner's ready.
We don't have to take them back, do we, daddy?
Of course not.
You want a drink?
No, no way.
Oh, I guess I could. Go on.
Cheers.
The hardest part is being away for so long, isn't it?
Why don't you come down to Perth and work for me?
Oh yeah, doing what?
I don't know, I'm juggling a whole lot of things
I could always do with someone
I can trust.
I guarantee you'll make more than you're making here.
You mean I'd move to Perth?
Can't pay you unless you're there.
I can sort it all out,
I can get a house, school for Jo and Emma, the whole lot.
Well thanks, Peter, but uh...
I don't really wanna move to Perth.
Yeah well, I suppose you're still dreaming of going to Paris?
Wake up to yourself, Johnny.
You're this oddball who sits in a caravan out the back pretending to be Billy Cross.
You got no future in that.
Yeah well, I just might suprise you and prove you wrong one day.
I don't see why you have to prove anything to anybody.
You wanna pack everything up and move to some tin pot city on the sea?
You know why you never went to Paris?
Tell me, Peter.
I reckon you're scared you're not good enough.
Am I really? Tell me?
Well what's stopping you? You got the time, you got the money,
3000 is more than enough to get you there.
Thanks, Peter.
That's great.
Whose got 3000? You got 3000?
I got 3000 dollars, yeah.
- Where'd you get that?
- Let's just forget about it.
You kept that to yourself?
We need that money.
- I bloody need it too alright!
- What for!?
What for!? Jesus...
We'll talk about it later alright.
Fuck!
I'm not going to Perth. No one is going to bloody Perth. Get it out of your head.
Shit!
Aren't you gonna take that stuff back?
The longer we keep it, the harder it's gonna be to return.
You wanna know what really shits me?
It wasn't the joke.
But that no one, not even my own bloody wife, thought for one minute that I might've sold a song.
You've been laughing at me just like the rest of them.
I have not.
Not on the outside, but on the inside you have.
Oh for gods sake Johnny, grow up!
Sold any songs lately?
Dingo Anderson?
Telegram.
I had nothing to do with it, I swear.
Don't say I didn't warn ya.
Now there's no need to run for the door, I'm not gonna gas bag for long.
I've just got a few thank-you's.
Firstly, to Meryl and Steve Thornton for putting up the tressel tables.
Meryl, I hope your back's better now.
Porky Chubs, whose out the back cooking the snags on the barbecue.
And to Janie Anderson, thanks for the great lamingtons.
Billy Thompson for providing the ice to keep the tinnies [beer] cool.
And to you mums, for keeping the kids from out under our feet.
And Poona's ladies auxiliary, for making those mountainous sandwiches we're gonna devour.
Who else?
Oh of course, to Dingo and the Dusters for giving us something to dance to.
I think that's it.
It's all yours, fellas.
It's all yours, fellas...
That was our own Dingo Anderson
 on trumpet.
"My girl val".
You were good, Johnny.
Just no one was expecting it.
Sure.
What happened to Peter?
He's gone home.
What do you mean home?
He's gone back to Perth.
Why'd he do that?
I told him to go.
Why?
Because he's in love with me that's why.
Joe McCarthy needs a hand with some fencing.
Sheep keep getting knocked over by cars.
Is that at Bundiby?
Pay is good, shouldn't be more than a week.
What about your birthday?
I'll be back by then.
Better be, the girls are planning a surprise party.
Surprise party eh?
I'm off like a dirty shirt.
- Ring us if you get a chance.
- I will.
PAYNE'S FIND
What did Payne find here?
Petrol station.
Peter?
You there?
Peter?
What're you doing here?
My wife says you're in love with her.
Is that true?
Shit, Johnny.
I don't know.
I've been so mixed up lately, I dunno what I've been doing or saying half the time.
Is Jane with you?
No she's home.
You wanna come on board?
I don't know.
Have you ever wondered that it might be better to have a dream rather than actually find out it's all a load of shit?
I need you to look after my dog, and stay away from my wife.
Closed?
Yes, closed!
You don't understand, I have to see...
Come back Monday?
Monday? No no, excuse me!
Monday!
No no, you don't understand.
Monday...
Monday...
You know where I can find Billy Cross?
I think he's dead.
Well that's it...
Well...
Here you are, boy.
Right...
Well um...
Hello, my name's John Anderson.
I'm from Australia.
We met a long time ago, and you said:
"If ever you're in Paris, look me up."
So, here I am in-...
No, let me think.
No guts, no glory.
I don't believe it. They're not home.
Hey Max, quick, what's this lady saying?
Want to leave a message?
Too late.
Depth charge.
I'll try anything once.
Depth charge.
You take care now, sorry If I kept you up.
Good morning.
Well Mr. Dingo, you have already seen more of Paris than most tourists.
I'm sorry about this Mrs. Cross, but yours was the only number I had.
If you would have answered our telegram, we could have made arrangements.
You mean... the second telegram was yours?
Second telegram?
You sure this isn't too much trouble?
Oh no, Billy wants to meet you.
Come with me.
You sure?
Sure sure sure.
Billy sleeps during the day.
Right.
Sit down.
Do you want something to drink?
Cup of coffee?
I'd love some tea if you have any.
You have any idea why I've come back?
Why don't you just tell me?
I need you with me, Jane.
You're all I think about.
I love you Jane, I love you, and I can give you anything you want.
Anything.
We can go wherever you wanna be.
Sorry I slept so long on your coach.
You know that old expression,
"The grass is greener on the other side"?
It's true.
Here you look down and you see grass and dirt.
Look straight ahead and you see green grass.
Think about it.
What brings you to Paris?
Came to see you.
Who, me? Me?
You're the reason I started playing.
I've got every record you ever made.
That's a gift from one hip maharajah.
Like a work of art.
Play me a C.
C.
I do a lot better when I'm warmed up.
Don't you play trumpet anymore?
I am playing trumpet.
I mean, don't you play trumpet?...
I don't play trumpet.
I'm hungry.
That's where they got to!
All the top end, that huge region, that was all sheep country once.
Well now, it's cattle country right down the Meekatharra, the place I showed you on the map.
You see the dingo is moving so far south...
Sometimes I wouldn't be surprised to see him strolling through the streets of Perth.
Whatever happened to that educated Dingo that you wrote so much about?
- He's a special one.
- Like you.
Too smart, too slow.
Too smart, I don't know.
Too slow? Yeah, he's like me.
I remember you.
Yes... 69, the Japanese were crazy about us... and we stopped and played a concert on a runway in the desert.
And you were there.
I sure remember you.
You know, I wonder so many times what my life would've been like if if your plane hadn't accidentally landed.
There are no accidents.
None.
G'day Joe, it's Janie here.
Janie Anderson.
Fine, thanks. Yeah...
Oh, it's alright.
Listen is John there?
No, no.
Oh he's been waylaid somewhere, yeah...
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Alright then, bye now.
Let's drive.
I think we're driving.
Goodnight, Dingo.
I hope you find Paris as exciting as your outback!
You know when I first got this car, everybody thought it was shit
'cos it was made in Germany.
But now there's are fucked, and mine's still running.
Your cassette player work?
Yeah it works.
I bought a tape of my music.
Wait a minute.
I don't wanna hear it.
Why don't you wanna hear it?
Because if I say I like it, you're gonna think I'm being nice, and if I say I don't like it, you're gonna be hurt.
You don't need my opinion.
Look, ever since that concert at Poona
Flat, I've been practicing trumpet.
I just wanna know if I'm even halfway good.
And then what?
I come here and make a living.
You've been here for 24 hours and half your time's been spent in jail.
You must really be a positive thinker.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
How come you don't play publicly anymore?
You know what a stroke is?
I reached for a beer in Munich and my head kept going down and down and down and down...
After playing the same old shit for forty years my soul pulled a switch on me.
I was becoming a jazz museum piece
I caused the stroke myself.
It was just like a brand new start for me.
So after six months in a cocoon,
I was able to... sleep four hour shifts, integrate my dreams with my music,
And now it's like a new start.
Everything is fresh.
Well, I don't think you should drive it.
What's that over there?
Club.
- A jazz club?
- A jazz club...
Everyone works there when they come to Paris.
I did my first gig there.
Wouldn't mind hearing some music.
I don't go into clubs.
I don't go in.
What you afraid of?
Nothing.
Nice to see you, where have you been man?
A table up front.
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you very much.
Hey, lookin good, brother
He never comes to the club.
He must like you.
I fixed it so you could sit in...
- Sit in!?
- Sit in.
Me?
I couldn't do that.
You need to know if you can play with the pros or not.
I'm not ready.
Haven't got my trumpet.
Got one now.
There all yours brother.
Dingo Anderson.
Poona Flat.
You sure you have the right number?
That's right.
Hey, I like what you do with your trumpet man.
Dingo, that was amazing, amazing.
My Australian buddy there.
Listen, if you're in town next week when I'm on if you wanna sit in, you got it.
We love it.
Take it 'cos you'll take his job.
You mean it?
Just wish my wife could've heard me, I really do.
It could be pretty hard for you here.
You don't think I'm good enough?
I didn't say that.
It's not that you aren't good enough.
But it's not gonna sound the same here.
What you brought with you, was the dingo sounds, the outback sounds.
It's not gonna be like that.
I understand that.
And even if you're good, it's still gonna be hard.
Sure.
We gonna record one of your compositions.
You're having me on [joking].
No, on that last tape you sent.
You serious?
Yeah. We're gonna call it
"Dogs of the Desert".
Jacques will send you a contract.
You leaving?
I better be getting back.
My girls are throwin' me a surprise birthday party.
Thanks for everything.
Well... now that you know you can do it, next time, bring your family.
We've got plenty of room.
I will.
Thank you.
Come on, Des.
Surprise!
Jane?
Jane I'm home.
Evening, Ruth.
Oh Johnny, Archie's gone out somewhere.
Could you give us a hand with this?
Sure.
Where do you want it?
Just round the back.
It is Tuesday isn't it?
Yeah, all day. 
Have you been drinking?
No not a drop.
You haven't seen Jane and the girls have you?
No I haven't seen them for a couple of days.
Do you know anything about a party?
What party?
Surprise!
Happy birthday darling.
I love you.
Aren't you gonna join in?
We spent a week learning this thing.

"Bid me discourse. I will enchant thine ear."
In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion.
In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm...
much less say "I love you" out loud...
intuitive understanding is everything.
The idea that a husband and wife should embrace...
and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing.
However to go out dancing with someone else...
would be misunderstood and prove more shameful.
Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, there is a secret wonder...
about the joys that dance can bring.
"Shall we dance?"
Hisako that's enough.
Let's go to one more bar.
Even accountants need to be entertained.
It's no fun drinking with co-workers.
It's not fair! The sales team gets all the perks: golf, karaoke, clubs, fancy restaurants...
I hate accounting.
We don't even get expenses.
You really hate it so much?
Do you really like it so much?
Not a matter of like or dislike; it's my job.
Nine o'clock.
Time to go home.
It's still early!
"The Kishikawa School of Dancing"
You're early. I thought you were drinking with your staff.
Something to eat?
No thanks. I'm tired.
I'll take a bath and go to bed.
...for what I'm about to receive.
Your father rarely stays out late.
You seem very pleased.
He really should get out and enjoy himself more often.
Why do you say that?
Don't you think he's too serious?
He works hard, then comes straight home every day.
He bought us this house.
That's what fathers do.
I feel kind of bad.
It's not as if you're lazing around.
I suppose so. I'm glad you understand.
But he does seem depressed lately.
Poor dear gets up before either of us.
So get up and make his breakfast.
He says I don't have to.
So that's being in love?
You look so happy.
I haven't worked for thirteen years.
I quit when i was pregnant with you.
It's tought but I'm happy to be working.
I have to if we're to pay off the mortgage.
How's your computer?
Good morning.
Here's my sheet.
Bought a house did you?
Somehow managed to.
A wife, a daughter and now a house with a garden.
Pledged my soul to the firm to pay for it.
No worries. You're successful, you're moving up.
Mr. Aoki, you've left a blank.
Really? Show me.
Sorry. I'll redo it.
What came over me?
That's so typical.
Some systems analyst!
He can't even use Windows.
And he has the nerve to ask about my computer.
I'll take Chikage and go look at clothes.
Meet at the coffee shop downstairs.
Still using the computer?
I'll be finished soon.
Okay. Later.
What am I doing?
Excuse me.
Just let me get by.
Get out of the way!
I don't believe this!
May I help you?
Well...
Your sign says,
"Feel free to watch."
- You want dance lessons?
- Yes.
Mr. Sakamoto... practice by yourself for a while please.
No previous schooling?
Right.
- Dance experience?
- I'm a total beginner.
You'll need a book of tickets.
You can reserve lessons when your instructor is free.
Tickets are 1,000 yen.
You'll need six per lesson.
6,000 per lesson?
Yes?
Seems rather expensive...
They are private lessons.
Excuse me, Mai.
Let's take a break.
Doesn't the beginner's class need one more?
I thought it was full?
No, we're one short.
Group lessons are once a week for 2,000 yen.
If you don't mind, it'll perhaps be best.
Which is it?
One hour group lessons are 8:00 pm on Wednesdays.
It's better to start with a group.
"Learn from other's mistakes."
Group lessons, please.
Your name and a contact number on here.
Contact number?
If that's a problem, just a name will do.
Certainly.
Books are ten, thirty and fifty thousand yen.
I'll take the ten.
Sorry to be late.
Whatever happened? You are late.
Can you forgive me?
You devil, you!
What is it about you?
Let's rumba today.
Go put your shoes on! I ran to get here!
I demand overtime.
So ravishing when angry...
"Sunflower Dance Supplies"
Looking for shoes?
For modern dancing?
I'm just starting.
Then how about these?
Eleven thousand five hundred yen!
Beginner's group... come over here please.
Class will begin.
Let's start with the blues again.
My name is Tamako Tamura.
Disappointed I'm older?
Not at all!
You look very... forgiving.
Thank you.
Everyone calls me
Tamako-sensei.
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
Are you all beginners?
My wife dragged me to a ballroom dance circle.
Okay, so how should we do this?
I don't mind starting from the very basics.
Let's start with party dancing, then gradually move on... to the modern and Latin steps.
I know those terms but these two probably... don't know anything about the various dances.
Good point.
Let me explain...
The social dances include the waltz, tango... the slow fox-trot, quick step and the Vienna waltz.
These make up the modern dances.
The rumba, cha-cha-cha, samba, paso double... and jive constitute the five Latin dances.
Together these are the ten competitive dances... and each qualifies for competition.
I hope one day... you'll get to try them all.
Today we'll start with the mambo.
The mambo and the jitterbug are non-competitive... but you'll fear no party if you learn them.
They're excellent foundations for ballroom dancing.
Lead with your left foot.
Your weight goes on your right foot.
Bring the left up to meet the right.
Go back with your right.
Take the weight on your left.
Then right up to the left.
That's one set.
Left-right-left... right-left-right.
The first two are quick.
Feet together is a slow step.
Two quick equals one slow.
Is that clear?
Simple isn't it?
These are the mambo's basic steps.
Let's try with a partner.
You two will lead.
The leader, that's always the man... leads with his left.
That's set in stone.
Ladies respond with their right.
Ready?
Bring your feet together.
I'm sorry.
It's alright.
From the top.
Next is the half turn.
Watch how I do it.
Ready?
Left foot, make a half turn, then bring both together.
Right foot, half turn, then together.
Now you try.
No, no, no. Look how I do it.
Left, turn, slow.
Right, turn, slow.
The fat gentleman can do it.
Concentrate on your own steps please.
Let's try it in pairs.
Half turns are initiated by the man.
Ladies respond one step later... and finish one step behind.
Go back on the foot you lead with.
From the top.
Start on your left... this goes back.
Right foot in and turn.
The same foot as you lead with.
You can do it. Once more.
Feet together.
Good exercise, isn't it?
Yes, I'm exhausted.
Give it our best shot!
She sure is pretty.
That's why you're here right?
Private lessons... that's the way.
Not that anything would come of it.
You're better off in a class.
She's all the sweeter when viewed from afar.
If she hadn't split with her partner... she'd be so busy competing she'd have no time to teach here.
That old goat comes three days a week.
Still hasn't noticed she loathes him.
Sooner or later he'll quit.
Wonder how long you'll last.
The missus literally dragged me over... to the local community center.
A social dance circle.
Taught by the local grocer.
He's a real poseur. but he has the old dears drooling.
He's really not that good.
I'm taking these lessons secretly... to surprise him and the missus.
What's your name?
Tanaka.
What's your excuse?
Sorry.
I shouldn't have asked a personal question.
Doctor's advice. I'm diabetic.
Really? And so young, too.
It's good exercise.
How about you?
I also heard dancing's good for the health.
That's what they all say.
Am I the only one who's being honest?
You look like a hot-shot, manager type.
The old ducks in my dance circle... would love you.
Well, time to go. Where do you live?
Maybe I can drop you off.
I live in Oji.
All the way from Oji?
And you, Mr. Manager?
I'm no manager. I live out past Tokorozawa.
That's miles away.
Funny how we all travel so far, ain't it?
Best kept under wraps, eh?
They'll think we are a bunch of dirty old lechers.
Before I go up the stairs at the school, I always... make sure no one's looking.
Mr. Sugiyama, look up.
Head up.
Is Dad home yet?
Not yet.
He stays out late Wednesdays.
That's good.
You'd rather he wasn't here?
You said he should go out and enjoy himself.
Did I?
But he does seem to be happier recently.
That's good news.
You were worrying that he was depressed.
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.
Wonder what cheered him up.
That's enough!
It's not your private dance floor!
And I'm sick of your one-trick rumba.
A cheap imitation of Donny Burns.
How can we tango to this rumba?
Isn't your time up anyway?
Get lost.
Go practice somewhere else.
Shut up... you fat, frustrated, old bag.
What?
Mr. Aoki?
What's going on?
This is pathetic.
You beg me to be your partner... then you create a scene like this.
I've never been so embarrassed.
Get yourself a new partner.
Letting this hysterical cow insult you.
Who are you calling a cow?
And you copied my dress!
Take yours back to the shop!
It sure was a shock to see you standing there.
I didn't recognize you.
Actually I was quite impressed.
Five year's practice would make a dancer of anyone.
Five years?
I had no idea.
I keep it well hidden.
Everyone gets the idea that you're strange.
Especially since I'm still single.
Of course they think
I'm just after girls.
But when I finish work... put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns...
Latin world champion... and I start to move to the rhythm...
I'm so happy, so completely free.
You know how it is for me at work.
But I blew it again.
I take part in amateur dance competitions.
J.A.D.A. organizes them... that's the Japan Amateur
Dance Association.
I'm at the third level.
But I still can't find a good partner.
I met that last one on a dance tour to England.
Yes, to watch the competitions.
She had no partner either so we teamed up.
She was so young and pretty, single, too.
It was a good chance.
That fat old bag ruined it.
She's probably rich... and has nothing to do but dance.
Why did you start dancing?
Well... I don't get much exercise recently. and I heard it's good for health.
That's what they all say.
Keep it secret.
Imagine what they'd say at the office!
Yes, of course.
You could come to one of our dances.
No thanks.
I've barely begun.
Doesn't matter. You look great.
Better than me.
It's easier if you go with someone.
More women than men, so every man's a prize!
Aren't you here to dance?
No point standing around.
I'll teach you. Let's dance.
Be a man. Dance with me.
Would you be so kind as to dance with me?
Thank you.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
Listen to the music.
Start on the second beat.
Okay? Two, three, four.
I'm sorry. Are you alright?
If you'll excuse me.
He is acting weird.
"Miwa & Co.
Private Investigations"
Excuse me.
We offer free consultation.
It's very discreet.
Maybe we can help.
He comes home late on Wednesdays and goes out on weekends.
On these days his shirts always smell of perfume.
Wednesday it's the same scent...
On weekends it's mixed.
He's seen making strange body movements.
Besides that, it's a woman's intuition...
Did you think of asking him?
Yes, many times, but...
But what?
I'm afraid to.
He's so straight.
If it is another woman it'll be... more than just casual.
And if he is having an affair?
I've never even considered it.
He might be caught up in... something weird?
But if it is... an affair, I'm afraid... to think I might lose him.
An investigation will cost at least 500,000 yen.
That's usually sufficient... to gather evidence for a trial.
Assuming we're talking about divorce.
But we're not really sure it is an affair.
You're right.
In your husband's case... there is no history of adultery and if it's enough to establish... he's not mixing with some strange group... then how about this?
We'll budget three days.
If it takes less, we'll give a refund.
Why not?
I'm not opposed to you appearing.
But you want him only because he's the best.
That's not reason enough to choose a partner.
Yes, it is. I'm a top class dancer too.
You just want to spite your previous partner.
Ever wonder why he left you?
He betrayed me
I was dancing well.
His mistake caused that accident.
He didn't ever try to cover for me.
You still think so?
It's not a partner's skill you are lacking.
It's your dancing.
Why can't you understand?
How can I?
You force me to teach these clods in the barn.
Is that my lesson?
You yourself learnt on this very same dance foor.
Starting this school was our dream.
I'm working. I'm giving lessons.
Why can't I get a new partner?
Why can't I dance at recitals?
Come in.
Tamako-sensi called to cancel today's lessons.
I see.
Sorry to interrupt.
Re-schedule your private lesons... and take tonight's group lessons.
Lucky boy!
Tonight she's in your arms at last.
Any preferences?
How about the waltz?
Mr. Sugiyama?
Yes. Why not?
Then let's practice the waltz.
I'll take you through the steps you've learned.
Mr. Sugiyama, you first.
Are you really a reporter?
Not just chasing after her like everyone else?
No, not me. I'm working.
Really?
Can you dance?
Wish I could, but I've never had the chance.
C'mon let's try.
I'll be the lead.
I'm on duty.
Give it a try.
He takes dance lessons every Wednesday.
So he is involved in something strange.
His instructor is a middle aged-woman.
Tonight's substitute was quite pretty.
I would'n mind dancing with her myself.
Getting around like this? You are kidding.
Dancing doesn't suit the Japanese body.
Guess he's just another dirty old man.
That substitute is looking for a partner.
He's certainly aiming hight.
Sensei.
What is it?
Thank you for today's lesson.
Not at all. I'm not as experienced as Tamako-sensei.
No, no, you were very good.
I was impressed.
Thank you.
No. I thank you.
I thought I'd go and eat.
I haven't had dinner yet.
But eating alone spoils the taste.
If you haven't eaten, perhaps we...
I'm sorry.
I prefer not to have private contact with students.
I see.
Excuse me.
One thing.
This may seem rude... but I hope you didn't join the class with me as your goal.
I take dancing very seriously.
It's a classroom not a disco.
Don't dance if that's what you're after.
Every Wednesday your husband attends... a ballroom dancing school.
Presumably he's late Wed. smelling of perfume... because of the dancing lessons.
One other point.
On weekends he goes to dance with his classmates.
The weekend perfumes you noticed... are from dancing with the various women there.
Our brief wasn't to prove adultery... so it's too early to make that conclusion.
Is this pretty lady his teacher?
His regular teacher is a more mature woman.
That lass is a substitute teacher.
I've never seen him this happy.
Personally, I don't think your husband.. is having a relationship whit her.
What makes you think so?
Experience as a detective.
But why dancing?
Him, dancing? I can't believe it.
Perhaps a woman on weekends.
I can investigate further.
You have nothing to worry about.
We don't know why he started dancing.
But the secrecy is surely because he's ashamed.
Experience again?
As a man... yes.
I suspect he will soon give up dancing.
- Why do you say that?
- A hunch.
He will tire of it.
I wonder...
Some hunch.
You forgot this!
Sorry, I'm so rushed.
Busy as always.
Thank you very much.
I don't get it.
It must be that substitute.
Your improved posture will give you away!
Hello there.
You're really improving.
A compliment from you, is praise indeed.
You're conscious of every footstep?
No, not yet.
But your posture is so good.
Is it really?
It gets dangerous when it's second nature.
Is that right?
Like golfers swinging their umbrellas at the train station.
Think I'll be practicing on the platform?
That's hard to imagine.
Well, you'd be the last one to notice.
Dance is that captivating.
Maybe. I never thought
I'd get in this deep.
Have you been to a dance hall?
No, not yet.
It's a lot of fun.
We should go sometime.
"You'd be the last to notice."
That flasy guy is "Jitterbug Hama"
He's a dance hall regular.
Those sitting over there... are waiting to be asked to dance.
You can hire a pro from the counter, over there.
Ms. Ishizaka, your partner awaits you.
Enjoy yourself. i'll be dancing with Marika.
Is that you Mr. Sugiyama?
Ms. Tamako.
What are you doing here?
That's my line!
I work here part time.
I'm alone so,
I've nothing to do on days off.
I moonlight here to keep dancing.
On your own?
No, I'm with Aoki.
She's very pretty. Who is she?
His new partner.
They entered... the Eastern Dancing...
Eastern Amateur Dance Gala?
Yes, that's it.
He insists on dancing with such young girls.
Hope he's not dumped again.
He should dance with Toyoko.
She's also looking for a partner.
How about you?
Not in competition, no way.
Isn't she fantastic?
Aoki is very much a Latin man.
He won't dance anything but Latin.
May I have this dance?
Hang on a minute!
If that's okay with you.
Shall I introduce you to someone?
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to dance with you.
How sweet!
But don't feel obliged.
Try someone else perhaps.
It's not that.
Some of my steps still need work.
So earnest! Here you can forget the steps and enjoy yourself.
That's "Joe Blues" over there.
They say he can make your backbone melt.
This tune.
Remember The King and I?
That bald actor.
Yul Brynner.
It was that film which started me dancing.
It still sets my heart racing.
He held Deborah Kerr's hands like...
Dance is more than... just the steps.
Feel the music and just dance for sheer joy.
Watch it!
- Sorry.
- Forgive us.
Oh, it's you! Be careful.
You've got nerve, you're hopeless!
You forced me.
I said I couldn't.
Sometimes the worst dressed dance best... like good dancers who say they can't.
Toyoko please!
Tamako-sensei!
Come see this.
Isn't that Mr. Kimoto?
Yes.
I hear he's going to give a demonstration.
What's happening?
He's a dance instructor, an all-Japan finalist.
He suddenly split with his partner.
Look, isn't that Mai?
So the rumor is true.
- Rumor?
- You know, breaking up with her partner.
Did she?
You should know, you're the one who likes her!
They did great at Blackpool, then suddenly split up.
Blackpool, the top world competition.
Don't you even know that?
Some say that Kimoto and Mai fell in love... and engineered the break-ups to get together.
Interesting place isn't it?
You're suggesting we dance here?
Isn't that why you're defying your father?
But why here?
It's not like we have to dance among them.
We needed a place for our debut... and the owner kindly offered us this anniversary event.
But this is not ballroom dancing.
Lounge lizards and showgirls.
What's wrong with that?
They're having a wonderful time.
Doesn't their dancing thrill you... fill you with inspiration?
Blackpool has a history... but in its own way, so does this dance floor.
So there's no hope then?
"Why should l, a Blackpool semi-finalist... dance in a dump like this?"
Am I right?
Is this some kind of test?
It wasn't intended to be, but it is now.
So I must have failed?
I can't dance here.
That's a shame.
Good luck finding someone.
You too.
You should lighten up and enjoy your dancing.
It's more than just competition.
I'm not suggesting we go to a hotel...
It's a short cut.
I thought... maybe we could become partners.
But our styles are too different.
No couple gets it right away.
We need practice.
No, that's not it.
When we're talking like this, you're fine.
But it's so creepy.
Your dancing, it gives me the creeps.
Mr. Sugiyama?
Not here yet.
You'll do.
Be my partner for a minute.
Good evening.
What's this?
Looks like Tanaka's being auditioned as a partner.
She's determined to move up to the next level.
They say men take three times longer to learn than women.
Stop. Control yourself!
Slobbering like that.
Your hands are dripping wet.
You're making me sick.
There's no way you're becoming my partner.
You dragged him out there!
Shut up short-ass.
That's rude!
You should watch what you say.
Fussy little man... with your fussy little steps!
You want to talk about my steps?
What about them?
Go on... share your wisdom!
Do I really make you sick?
Am I really that disgusting?
The first girl I ever liked said that.
And I wasn't even dancing.
My doctor recommended dancing as exercise.
First I was embarrassed.
But soon all my cares were gone... like being drunk.
My heart singing.
Fireworks exploding in my head.
All my worries forgotten... and I began to love dance.
But I suppose... even when I'm dancing...
Do I really look that bad?
No, of course not.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.
Forgive me.
Toyoko!
This is the third time she's collapsed from overwork.
This is Toyoko's daughter.
Sorry for all this trouble.
You must be Mr. Sugiyama.
Yes.
She tells me everything.
Said you were elegant... a little like my late father.
She seemed sad to hear you had a family.
I hope she wasn't too pushy.
She's under such pressure lately.
She can't find a partner.
The last one insulted her dancing.
She's desperate to enter the competition.
She works hard at two jobs.
And helps out a friend's restaurant.
Every night she's out dancing.
No wonder she collapsed.
How long has she been widowed?
As far back as I can remember.
She gave up dancing to concentrate on raising me.
She first met him at a company dance party.
It's by far her favorite memory of him.
She's always telling that story.
She regrets I missed seeing him waltz
But Japonese ballroom dancing is pityful.
Sorry, I souldn't have said that.
Why don't you be Toyoko's partner?
No, I'd be terrible.
You'd be okay. I guarantee it.
She'd never agree.
My dancing is far too bad.
She'll be fine.
You heard what her daughter said.
She's quite fond of you.
And dance begins with the dancer's feelings.
Besides, you're not a bad dancer.
Spare me just two hours, three times a week after class.
Two hours?
I won't charge you.
Special training.
There's still three months before the competition.
We'll be able to do it.
Isn't that right, Mai?
You look fit as a fiddle.
I'm full of energy and raring to go!
You're a brave man... or you've got strange tastes.
Look, I don't know what my daughter said to you.
But I don't want sympathy, okay?
Stop being so defensive.
He agreed because Mai asked him to do it.
You hardly need sympathy.
I guessed as much.
Ready? Let's begin.
We'll need to do the waltz and the quick-step.
Plus the rumba and paso doble.
Dance them in that order.
First the waltz.
Wait!
If you don't lead this is hopeless!
We haven't covered that yet.
You've got to be joking!
And you want to be my partner?
That's enough!
He's already under pressure.
Don't make it worse.
Bear her no mind.
I just wanted to see you two paired.
We'll stick to modern today.
Everyone's worried about you.
You don't come to practice.
Me too, I've...
I've ended up in the competition.
And with that Toyoko Takahashi too.
Once more.
Good night everyone.
If you'll excuse me.
Good evening.
Hello again. Glad you came.
What about trying Mr. Aoki... for the Latin program?
You must be joking!
Give me Sugiyama any day.
But I was watching his rumba the other day.
It still needs a lot of work.
I'm not saying he can't do it... but his Latin will take time to improve.
Both may be a bit too much.
I was going to ask you if we could stick to just one... when Mr. Aoki happened to call.
There's someone he must beat in this competition.
And Mr. Aoki is, after all, a Latin man.
So if Toyoko will do...
I mean, seeing that you two haven't always gotten along so well.
Teaming with me to get revenge?
Must be a big deal.
Don't tell me that latest little bimbo... up and left you again?
Trash your style, did she?
Yes, she did.
She insulted me.
Said my dancing made her sick!
Are you busy tonight?
Not particularly.
Would you mind taking
Mr. Sugiyama?
I want to watch these two.
Don't hesitate!
Really put that right foot out.
Ready? Once more, from the top.
That first step is so important.
You're still hesitating.
The leader must commit his whole body... to convey to his partner... the tone of the entire dance.
A weak first step transmits nothing.
This is how you did it.
See how it says nothing?
Be confident, you must stride.
It's most important that your own right side... remains firmly up against your partner.
Feel that?
Shall we?
That's not it.
Take a bigger stride.
Yes. That's more like it!
Now let's try it with Toyoko.
Watch them, Mai.
Wait for her to come.
Then take her firmly.
Do you see?
The judges watch from the minute you start.
Don't hold back.
You're already hesitant.
Pull her in closer.
Take a big stride with the right.
Toyoko, will you stop that!
But he's stiff as a board.
I'm terribly sorry.
Not that!
Here, from the heart.
Will you both try to be serious.
We're serious, aren't we?
Would you consider tutoring them for the competition?
Wait for her to come to you.
Look left.
Is he okay?
I'll call an ambulance.
To win, you need to stand out and to dance well.
With anywhere up to ten couples on the floor at once... you're lucky to get ten seconds from the judges.
This is the quick-step format.
You enter from here.
With an initial sweep past the crowd.
Alternating scissors...
Then a side-chass?.. change direction.
To a running finish and natural turn.
Isn't it exciting!
The waltz usually begins facing outward... and starts with a half-turn... leaving the middle wide open.
So take center stage and do something unusual.
Even if they hate it, the judges will be watching.
Are you alright?
Let's take a break.
Mr. Sugiyama's exhausted.
No, I'm fine.
- I'm beat too. I'll get drinks.
- I'll go.
It's okay. Mineral water for you,
Chinese tea for him.
Thanks.
Sorry, I'm getting carried away.
No need to apologize.
At my age, it's embarrassing to say so... but every day I feel so alive.
Even being tired feels great.
It's been a long time since I felt this enthusiastic.
It's a good feeling.
Lately, I've begun... to think about Blackpool again.
Up until just recently...
I haven't wanted to.
Blackpool... is a small, seaside resort town.
Normally it's very quiet.
But that completely changes... for the championship week.
I first went to Blackpool when I was five.
The central ballroom... was so big and so splendid.
I joined all those strangers... imitating their steps.
I'll never forget the finals at the Winter Garden.
Particularly one young couple.
They lost in the semi-finals.
They had the most enchanting quick-step routine.
But just at the end... they collided with another couple.
He fell heavily and ended up in the hospital.
But both my parents... were tremendously impressed.
I asked why.
Father explained that to the end he tried to protect his partner.
Since that first day in Blackpool... dance has become my entire world.
What started me dancing... was you gazing out of the window like that.
You can see that window from the trains.
Every day on the train home
I looked for you.
When I saw you, somehow I felt relieved... or disappointed if you weren't there.
Your melancholy look...
It totally charmed me.
I married at age 28.
Had a child by 30.
At 40, I bought the home
I longed for.
I've worked so hard for these things.
I thought it was a happy life... but after I bought the house... something changed.
It's no reflection on my wife... or on my love for my daughter.
But something was different.
I need to work to pay the mortgage.
I accepted that... but something was still missing.
Then you appeared.
Looking up and seeing you there... made me want... just one time... to dance with you.
Even after...
I was very rude to you... you stuck with dancing.
I really felt like giving up.
But if I had...
I would have been everything you accused me of.
Of course, it's true... that affection for you... was what brought me to the class.
But to be confronted with it... was a shock.
I thought,
"She didn't have to be like that."
I wanted to prove to you... that it wasn't because of you.
I'd said I was here to dance.
But...
But what?
No sooner did I decide to continue... than I really began to like it.
I was... watching you too.
From the window here...
I saw you practicing on the platform.
It warmed my heart.
I'll never forget it.
It's just not fair.
Selfish man.
"Eastern Japan Amateur Dance
Competition"
Here we go.
Mr. Sugiyama, you look so serious.
Relax a little.
Ready? Cheese!
How come you're here?
Inspired by our enthusiasm.
This is the missus.
Don't be so rude!
This is my niece.
The wife roped her in too.
Tanaka wanted a partner.
They dance great together.
Mr. Sugiyama.
That suits you.
My late husband's best tails.
You deserve a medal for putting up with her.
Enough from you!
Go and save seats for us.
The first round will be the rumba.
Number 1 09...
Number 1 1 0...
Mr. Aoki looks like he's going for it.
Fussing with your hair!
Our routine was crap.
They deliberately messed with it.
Take the damn thing off and dance!
You wouldn't understand!
Bald creeps are not my specialty.
Alright then.
Let's get rid of it!
Mr. Aoki's fantastic.
He cast off more than just the wig.
Mom.
They're announcing finalists.
I'm coming.
Numbers 1 01, 1 03...
I thought Mr. Macho was pretty good.
Bad attitude.
"Ungentlemanly behavior"
It's a British sport after all.
He'll be too nervous even to hear the music.
You must guide him.
Leave it to me.
Mr. Sugiyama. We're on.
Mr. Sugiyama... just flow with the music... and enjoy the dance.
First round. The waltz.
Here they are.
But they look nervous.
No, over there.
Did you arrange this?
I had no choice.
It's easiest if she sees for herself.
She's headed for a breakdown.
You're a detective, not a marriage counselor.
You're not even billing her.
There's Dad.
The start is everything.
Take a deep breath.
Now!
They did it!
Points lost there.
But who's fault is it?
That's why I don't like amateurs.
Can't keep from bumping into others...
or being bumped themselves.
How you react is most important.
Judges naturally notice bumping.
But a quick recovery and a calm return to dancing...
on the contrary...
can be noted and scored pretty highly.
You're hooked aren't you?
C'mon, Dad!
So close and he doesn't notice us.
Is your daughter here?
I hardly think so.
I could be mistaken... but I'm sure I heard a girl call out...
"C'mon, Dad!" just as we began.
And now for the quick-step.
Well done!
He's great.
He's doing well.
Told you.
Dad!!
Watch out!
You knew?
Yes.
For a long time.
But I was afraid to talk about it.
I kept thinking you'd tell me.
But you didn't say a word.
At first,
I thought it was an affair.
It was a relief to find out it wasn't.
But I still couldn't understand why.
It brought you to life.
I felt completely on my own.
Today when I saw you... it was even harder to understand.
It hurts so much.
Even if it was dancing... it was still an affair.
It wasn't just an affair.
I was seriously involved.
Until today.
Until today?
Yes. I've finished with dance.
Why? Because of me?
It'll be all my fault.
No, not at all.
It's just not for me... that's all.
Hey, look at this.
It'll blow you away.
What is it?
You won't believe your eyes!
Is that Aoki?
Read this part.
"After suddenly doffing his trademark wig, Donny Aoki... swept the floor before unexpectedly defaulting."
"Donny" Aoki!
That bald jerk.
Ballroom dancing... of all things!
You can just imagine that dirty pervert.
There's nothing wrong with it!
If you've never danced... you should watch what you say.
- Hi there!
- Hello.
I hope you didn't quit dancing because of me.
I really don't care, let's dance again.
You were dancing really well.
You did so well in just a year, don't throw it away.
It's not that.
I've just had enough of dancing.
I began on a whim.
You saw the results.
I'm sorry for disturbing you more dedicated dancers.
Please forgive me.
Forget all that.
It doesn't matter.
Maybe you have a lot on your mind.
But if you want to dance, call me.
I won't stand for you dancing with anyone else!
Mai is going to England.
We're having a farewell party next Friday.
Please join us.
Mai would be pleased.
This is a letter from her.
Thank you so much.
Please do not laugh at me...
for saying this...
but I want to thank you...
from the bottom of my heart.
In the competition you danced superbly.
You did your utmost...
to protect Toyoko.
She is fully aware of that.
We all know you did your very best.
And that's why Toyoko put her trust in you.
She really does want to dance with you again.
Remember I once told you about Blackpool?
I didn't tell you about my failure there.
That's because I never really faced up to it myself.
But now I can tell you about it.
Two years ago, when we finally arrived there...
I was realizing a dream...
so thrilled just to be there.
I'd sacrificed everything for competition.
I had an excess of self-confidence.
The audience's support for us was overwhelming.
We made it to the semi-finals.
I rode on the waves of applause and cheering.
I was thrilled and moved, and I danced my best ever.
And then...
just like you...
we collided during the quick-step.
I blamed my partner.
Why didn't he protect me?
His reaction stunned me.
He wanted us to break up.
Even if we did go on to win...
he wanted us to split after the competition.
I couldn'y understand.
We were both aiming for the top.
Why did he betray me?
Soon after I returned to Japan.
I wanted to show him up...
so I looked for a top-class dancer.
But my father wouldn't let me take a new partner.
He had me teach at his school.
He never wanted me to teach...
but he made sure I did.
I didn't understand why.
I was so unhappy...
reluctantly teaching.
Then you arrived at the school.
During the months we practiced for the competition...
something began to change within me.
I came to realize that I had always danced alone...
never fully trusting my partner.
My failure at Blackpool...
was not his fault.
It was a natural result of me dancing only for myself.
It was you who taught me...
the splendor...
of dance when you trust and enjoy.
I decided to start again from the beginning.
So thank you very much.
I'm looking forward to seeing you at the party.
Going to the party?
She's going to England, right?
Seems you know everything.
I owe you an apology.
I hired a private detective.
I was afraid to ask you.
You've always been so serious.
And because I love you.
Please go and dance with her tomorrow.
Continue your dancing.
I'd rather you were full of life... than see you look so down.
Teach me to dance too.
Dance with me the way you would with her.
Will you be quiet!
I quit dancing!
Why not dance with Mom?
Do it!
Dance with each other.
You were wonderful.
Please dance for me.
When I move my left, go back on your right.
If it's my right, then it's your left.
We turn 90 degrees to the right... and bring our feet together.
Back on my left, you come right.
My right, your left.
As you turn 90 degrees, bring both legs together.
Alright, once more.
I'm sorry that I made you feel so lonely.
"Going shopping later with Chikage.
See you after the party.
Love Masako."
Where's Sugiyama?
He's already left.
He has?
Is Sugiyama here yet?
Not yet.
That's strange.
He's already left work.
Look at Hattori showing off.
Go dance when the rumba starts.
Sitting waiting isn't going to bring him here.
Maybe he's not coming.
"Shall we dance Mr. Sugiyama?"
And now for the final number this evening.
This time let's have
Ms. Mai choose her own partner.
Shohei Sugiyama... Koji YAKUSHO

MAN 2 ON RADIO:
Hop Harrigan,
America's Ace of the Airwaves!
MAN 3 ON RADIO: A big howdy-do and how-are-you from Chicago, Illinois, where we're about to bring you the Cinderella story of 1939.
That's right. Local radio station WBN may be small, but they've got a lot of big dreams.
And tonight, those dreams could come true as they go nationwide in their revolutionary attempt to create a fourth national radio network.
Oh, Miss Henderson, the Biff Blaster, Space Ranger script is a minute and a half over, and Mr. Whalen doesn't know what he should do.
Well, lose all the exploding asteroids, give the Venusians one-syllable grunts.
Have you seen the General?
No. ljust want you to know that I'm not just a page.
You know,
I'm a man of many talents, and if you ever give me a chance to prove myself, you won't be sorry, Miss Henderson. Mrs. Henderson.
Her name is Mrs.
Right, Mr. Henderson.
Not now, Roger. I don't have time to be talked out of divorcing you.
"Hiya, Roger, that's a swell suit. Oh, the dog says hello,
"and, say, what's that last thing? Oh, yes,
"my life has no meaning without you."
Suit up, fellas.
Yes, ma'am.
Penny, this is me. Remember?
The joint checking account, the little hairs on the sink, you know.
How can you throw away everything we have?
Had, Roger. Past tense.
Speaking of tense,
I'm busy.
I'm trying to stay on top ofthings around here.
(DRUM BEATING) I always liked you on top...
Ofthings.
He didn't let me finish.
Walt!
Walt!
Yes.
I can't do this scene in the Second Act.
It's terrible!
It's unmotivated...
Calm down, boys.
Clive, you're absolutely right.
Now, the problem as lsee it is this...
Kill him in the first act.
We'll have one more go at it.
Has anyone seen the General?
On stage.
On stage.
Let's go, men.
No time for slackers.
Thirty minutes to combat.
Chest out, shoulders back.
Little more spit on that shine.
Excuse me, General, sir, you're needed back in your office.
Can't lead the troops from the rear.
It's about the script, it's Mr. King.
Carry on, men.
Our sponsor wants to give us a well-deserved pat on the back.
The most revolting, moronic and insipid trash
I've ever read in my life.
And, General, I expect you to do something about it.
Calm down, Bernie.
We're open to suggestions. Damn right you are. And here are mine.
Billy! Billy, my baby!
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
Hi, Son.
Best row in the house.
Looks like we're finally going on the air.
Let's check the tower voltage and turn on the generators.
Those scripts stink!
They're not funny.
Here, look at this one.
A philosophy professor who murders people by convincing them they don't exist?
It's satire, Mr. King.
It's crapola, Mrs. Henderson!
I am General Wha|en's biggest sponsor, young lady.
And if! pull out, the others will follow.
You heard him, Henderson. Double-time. Yes, sir.
It's so silly, isn't it? The little disagreements couples have?
Little disagreements?
You had an affair, Roger, with the station manager's wife.
I told you 100 times nothing happened.
Right, with an actress billed as the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl.
It's not my fault she's done the classics.
Everything was fine, everything was jake, and you had to throw it all away for one night of pleasure.
Well, believe me, sister, there was no pleasure.
Spare me your shortcomings.
Penny, Penny, did you hear what King just did?
He threw out halfthe scripts.
He threw out halfthe scripts.
Someone ought to stand up to him.
Someone ought to stand up to him.
Five primetime scripts, he just gives them the heave-ho.
For the love of Mike, will you say something?
Fix your rug.
Oh, my God.
Mr. General Whalen Junior, sir. Yes.
You're the director.
Yes.
This is no time to panic. Can you think of a better time?
Five scripts!
Five scripts!
Don't! Tell that S-O-B King to do his own rewrite!
Gentlemen, lady, please, a little decorum.
What's going on in here?
You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
Penny's just doing herjob. Now, let's give her a little support.
Let's put our shoulders to the wheel, and, you know, do whatever it is
Penny wants us to do.
That's not funny. Listen, kids, I know this stinks.
I know you've been working on those scripts for six months, and I know we go on the air in 15 minutes.
But somehow, you gotta take these cockeyed notes and make them magic.
You'll get paid overtime.
She's right.
That's the word.
Am I a complete raving lunatic, or have we not been paid anything in the last three weeks?
Can't both be true?
ZOLTAN: The knife in the back.
The sound of the human head smashing.
No. Something is not quite right.
Try honeydew.
Good idea.
CLAUDETTE: Because
I'm your wife, that's why!
And next time you send me flowers, spell my name right!
Oh, hey... Thank you very much, I was...
Oh, Mr. Katzenback, Ruffles said he'd like to speak to you right away.
Said you'd know what it was about.
Ruffles?
Ruffles?
Ruffles. Trumpet player. Oh, please, that horn-blowing...
Now, you listen to me, Junior.
Don't you think that I don't know what's going on, because I do know, and now you know that I know.
Listen, I don't know what you know that I know, but I do know that you don't know what you think you know.
Oh, no?
No.
Come on, Penny, back to the booth.
Clearly, this man is an idiot.
Sir?
Yeah?
Wrong way.
Oh.
Please.
Okay, so he leans over and he kisses the moose, and then...
And he says what?
"Honey, I kissed a moose!"
Forget the moose! I could care less about the moose!
I got something else that he could kiss.
All this work without a day's pay!
I think my head's gonna explode!
No. Still not the sound ofthe head smashing.
That's it.
To all the local stations who have affiliated with us, be assured that I have assembled a top-notch squadron of professionals, redefining the phrase
"grace under fire."
Help!
Miss Henderson? Have you seen her? No.
Miss Henderson?
Anyone seen Miss...
Billy.
Oh, Mr. Whalen Junior, sir.
Yes.
They don't know whether they're opening on the announcer or the music.
Oh, that's right. I forgot to make up my mind about that one. ok3Y-
Forty seconds to air, and where the hell is our director?
Okay, I got it. Decision made. Problem solved.
Thirty seconds, Max. That's good. That's good news.
Here we go.
And now, gentlemen, I give you America's newest network,
WBN.
Junior, what are we opening with, music or announcer?
Okay, cue the...
TOMMY: 5, 4, 3...
Cue the announcer!
Cue the announcer.
Cue Dexter.
DEXTER: Clear the airwaves.
Clear the airwaves.
And from the four corners of this great country, the Whalen Broadcasting
Network says,
"Hello, America! "
Please welcome the Rick Rochester Band with The Dead Tones and the lovely
Miller Sisters.
But first, gather up the kids and caboodle and stay with us till the stroke of 12:00, for an evening ofeverything but the kitchen sink.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Oh, well, it sounds like we have that, too.
Believe you me, folks, we've got a night full of surprises.
MAN: "Dig and dig to find some dirt
(LAUGHING) "Dig too deep and you'll get hurt"
Something cut in?
Well, that's not right.
What went wrong, Max?
Must have been an open mike.
No, no, no.
I only have one pot open.
Cue the band.
Cue the band.
(SINGING LOVE IS ON THE AIR
TONIGHT)
I hate opening nights.
Aunt Millie's.
Stand by, Aunt Millie's.
Watch that overload.
Zoltan, you got a pen?
Thanks, pal.
Max, promise me nothing else is gonna go wrong tonight.
Promise.
We've got a show, people.
MAN: Out!
No writers backstage.
What a ham.
Get him off.
Close the curtain.
Close the curtain.
Cue the commercial.
Cue the commercial.
He's dead.
Stand by, Black Whip.
Will you stop fussing?
Hate to be a stickler for detail, but we don't have a script.
We don't have... We don't have a script? Where is Roger?
Billy, would you get to the writers‘ room?
Tell Roger we need that script right away.
Right. You can count on me,
Miss Henderson.
Through rain, snow, sleet...
Billy, beat it!
Keep going.
So the Black Whip hits him on the head with his log.
Dad, he doesn't have a log, he has a whip.
If he had a log, he would be known as the Black Log.
What do you expect me to do, improvise?
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.
Let's get back to what we're not getting paid for.
This ending is strictly phonus-balonus.
Can't we find a fresh way out of this?
Let's think...
He could hug him.
Hug him?
Hug him?
Yeah. Tell him they're long lost brothers and make him his partner.
Morgana, you did it again.
You know, she did it again! Let's go, let's go!
We lost him.
Not again.
Not again.
This is just horrible!
Not really.
Catch your head in a threshing machine, now that's horrible.
How convenient.
Oh, shut up.
Out of the way! Out of the way! Watch it, Billy.
This new ending's gonna knock them dead. Hey, you guys, where's the...
Script?
MAN: Move! Move!
Come on, go!
We've got to talk, Junior.
Not now.
Gangway! Coming through!
Coming through!
Hot script coming through!
Hang on to your toupee,
Junior.
MAN 1: Hi, Roger.
No, no, no. I'm okay.
I want my script! I will not go on without my script!
MAN 2: Sorry, Mac.
This way out, guys.
It's amazing people don't get killed around here.
Moley hokes! Ruffles is dead.
I can't believe it.
Hey-
Hey, you need a fill-in on trumpet?
Just keep her on, keep her on. Get her back on.
It's incredible. The woman's been doing the same damn thing over and over and over again for five minutes.
MAN: Get this stiff out of here.
The girl has about
30 seconds before she drops.
Five bucks says you're wrong. You got it.
Fellas, wait!
Hey!
Mr. H, where'd you go? Come on, Penny needs that script now!
Roger!
Oh, God.
Well, she brought down the house.
Let's go straight to another commercial.
Cue the King commercial.
Cue Dexter.
Well, we all know the Black Whip's unbeatable, as unbeatable as a bottle of King brew beer.
Is the Black Whip standing by?
BLACK WHIP: I don't care if their sponsors are here!
I asked for a big gun and they give me this silly little teeny one!
Phil sounds nice and relaxed.
Roger, where the hell have you been?
The, the...
What? Spit it out!
The lights were against me.
Go!
And like the Black Whip, it's strong.
Oh! The typist.
Nice of you to join us!
Phil.
Thirty seconds, Phil.
That filthy mess is my script?
DEXTER: Some pals are dropping by after a day at the ballpark.
Which beer will replenish their zest and bring that sparkle back to their eye?
Look, Phil, come on, cut it out!
Fifteen seconds.
Fifteen seconds!
Cue the organ.
DEXTER: The Black Whip.
Cue curtain.
They call me the Black Whip.
The other way. The other way.
Are you all right?
Oh, peachy, now.
I could use a hand up, though.
Well, looks like we lost the evil Freeman gang, Happy.
Let's ride the DBs on this whip crack.
BLACK WHIP:
I don't like it, Happy.
It's too darn quiet out there.
Listen, nothing but crickets.
HAPPY: Look out for that rattlesnake, Black Whip!
Hand me my whip, Happy.
You got him, Black Whip.
Oh, no, the Crazy Gulch Gang!
(GUN FIRING) Here they come. They're shooting at us!
Lookit. Oh, no!
Knock it off, Roger.
Have you finished the Gork: Son ofFire script yet?
It's percolating.
Well, bring it to a boil.
Oh, come on, Penny. Okay, okay. Now, here's how I figure it.
We met working on the radio, we got married working on the radio.
We can't get divorced. You might end up marrying out ofthe medium.
PENNY: Great idea.
Someone with less imagination.
Less imagination?
Have you seen Walt Junior?
No, ma'am.
Where the hell is he?
Well, excuse me, operator, I think I have a bad connection.
And, say, if it's Claudette you're talking about, that was your imagination!
My imagination!
I saw you locked together in her dressing room like Siamese twins attached at the zipper. But she attacked me.
What? Assault with a friendly weapon? You were lying on top of her.
Oh, now, come on, Penny. She took me down with a headlock.
I never knew what hit me.
Your shirt was off! It ripped on the hat rack when I fell!
Well, she wasn't wearing a stitch!
Breakaway evening gown?
Okay, okay, so the woman holds the land speed record for stripping.
What is it, sweetheart?
Well, I...
Mr. Ruffles...
I mean, I know nobody liked him, and he drank and all, but I'm just thinking about his wife and his four kids, and it's just so awful.
Ruffles is dead?
This is no time to give up.
We're all wearing our Thermic Molecular Transometer suits.
They should protect us in our quest to thwart the Neptunian lava monster.
BETTY:
Biff, it's getting closer!
Jumpin'jiminy gee whiz, Biff!
Quiet, Jimmy.
There's no time for that now.
Betty, let me check your tubes.
Check anything you want, Biff.
After all, the future of the universe depends on you.
Okay, okay, so you don't believe me.
But if you just give me a chance, I'll prove it, Penny.
Prove to me you can rewrite
Home is Where the Heart Aches.
For Pete's sake, come on. I need that script in 12 minutes, Roger.
You'll get your rewrite and proof positive there's no funny business between Claudette and me.
PENNY:
Wabash 3-1800, please.
Did you happen to find us a director?
Mrs. Reedy?
Oh, standby, Polka Minute.
No, no, Claudette. What about Ruffles? You big octopus.
ROGER: Claudette.
Caught me at a bad time, kid. I'm in.
So am I.
Nobody enters my dressing room uninvited.
What the hell do you think that star means?
You're Jewish?
I don't have time to mince words, Claudette. I want my marriage back.
And you're gonna get it for me, tonight, when you tell Penny what really happened.
Scram, scribbler, you're boring me.
Here. Is that what you want? Huh?
You want me to beg?
I'm so deep in the doghouse, I'll beg, I'll fetch, I'll roll over.
What more can I do,
Claudette?
I'm risking everything just coming here.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) If I'm caught with you again...
I'm a dead man.
HERMAN: Claudette?
Oh, God, it's my husband.
Herman, I told you, I don't like to be disturbed before a show or after a show or at home in my bedroom when I'm thinking about a show!
I spoke to Ruffles before he died.
What do you mean?
Who is that?
No, not under there. Geez, I could have sworn I left that script...
Oh, hiya, Herman.
I didn't hear you come in.
You! What is this weasel doing in here?
Maybe it blew over there.
What do you think?
Roger!
About that script change you wanted me to run past Penny, would after the show be soon enough?
After the show? Sure.
Sure. Great.
Well, guess I'll get back to the old word factory.
Leave you two alone.
All by yourselves.
Good night.
Later.
WOLFGANG:
Shocking, isn't it, my dear?
No, Wolfgang, don't!
Can't you see you're mad?
Mad? Mad, you say?
But I'm the one with the branding iron, and you're the one with the soft, pink flesh.
Now talk!
Okay, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.
It's paprika.
Paprika is the secret of my potato salad.
Paprika?
Hey, quick rewrites.
Those writers are pros.
Once they warm up, they'll start hitting them out ofthe park.
...Pontiac running board wasn't as good as the Chevy.
Dad, do you wanna shut up about the car?
Please, I need a script now!
Wait a minute, wait a minute! There's one!
MAN 1: That's one ofthe good ones. MAN 2: You almost lost it.
Take this one, kid.
Great.
That was easy. Wait a minute. This is Tom Adventure.
They need Home is
Where the Heart Aches.
MAN: Home is Where the Heart Aches!
Two minutes, no script.
And no director.
I could yell "fire" over the intercom. We could call it a night.
Hey, wait a minute, this is good stuff. Who put this in the garbage?
I did. It stinks.
That's yesterday's script.
Okay, now we're cooking with gas. That's a great script.
Well, hello.
This is sensational!
That's the best. okay...
Terrible. FATHER: No wonder it was in the garbage.
Roger, this is terrible. This is bad. This is bad stuff.
I found it, Jules.
It belonged to Ruffles.
Oh, if you're gonna be a serious gin-hound,
I recommend that you develop some taste.
This is rat poison.
Oh, what the hell.
For Pete's sake, Jules, we got work to do.
I'll drinkto that.
(SINGING BACK IN THE SADDLE
AGAIN)
DEXTER: You idiot.
Don't stick your bald head in my face again.
We'll finish our little discussion later.
Are you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
Ups-a-daisy. You should be in the booth. Why?
You're the director.
I know that.
It's not like I don't know what I do. I do know what I do.
It's just that when you have as much to do as I do do...
Don't tell my dad about this, okay? He'll have my head.
Then where would you put your hair?
I'm sorry?
I said,
I'll see you down there.
Okay, Wa|t's on his way.
Now all we need is a script.
What? No script?
Girls, girls, please. Back to the mikes. It's gonna be just fine.
We need some sort of a final scene here between the husband and the wife.
Yes. Now, think, think, think.
What ifthe wife smashes him over the head with a frying pan, then chops him in hundreds oftiny little pieces with her shiny, new carving knife?
I don't think so.
It's a family show.
Okay, well, then, what if she does it to the whole family?
ALL: No!
What's wrong with you?
You never like any of my ideas.
Hold it. Husband says,
"Darling, you can't leave.
"What would it take to make you stay?"
She says, "Try chloroform."
This isn't a comedy.
That wasn't ajoke.
The hell it wasn't. Okay, okay, okay, okay. How about he says,
''I can't go on without you.
I can't clean, I can't iron,
''I don't know my way around the kitchen."
And she says, "Buy a map.
Then we'll talk.''
Morgana, two. Writers, nothing. FATHER: She's good.
WOMAN: That works.
I know.
Okay, here you go, kid.
Take it away.
Go, go, go!
Run! Run!
Go, go, go!
I'm going. I'm going!
Fifteen seconds.
I have the scripts!
Mr. Katzenback.
Have you people no idea of discipline?
We have a script.
And we have a director.
Ofsorts.
Cue that slimeball announcer.
Cue Dexter.
And now time for Home is Where the Heart Aches.
Rotate the stage.
Oh, I hate that stage.
This rotating stage is the best idea I've ever had.
Cue the organ.
Tonight, we join Mildred and her mother in their tastefully decorated kitchen.
Not quite ready.
Billy.
Slow stop. No, slow!
That's Billy.
Abandoned by Jim, my husband of 20 years, and recently disturbed by the news that Ellen, my loving daughter, is marrying Jim's illegitimate stepson,
I find myself mired in a week-long depression.
Tell me, Mom.
What should I do?
Die, infidel.
Die like a dog, writhing in pain from the horror known as the curse of Nebuchadnezzar.
Well, that's not right.
Thanks, Mom. You always seem to know what's best.
That's good!
We didn't write that.
It's too creative.
You got that right.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Excuse me, I think someone's at the door.
Billy.
Is there a problem?
Damndest show I ever seen.
Artistic.
Oh, that must be your father. You take it.
What the hell is going on?
One is doing the soap, the other's doing Tom Adventure.
Toilet.
Sir?
Billy!
You bellowed?
Get this to the actors, and then get those scripts sorted out.
Well, Mom, it's getting close to lunchtime and...
Traitorous words, you American slime.
And your last, as it's time for me to finish you off with your own rifle.
MOM: Did you hear me?
Your own rifle.
My own rifle?
Yes, yes. Where is that rifle ofyours?
You're not going to shoot me, are you?
Well, perhaps I was hasty.
After all, shooting you would be wrong.
Whoa. That hurt, that hurt.
Mildred, is that you?
What's he doing now?
I'm sorry
I frightened you, dear.
I was kidnapped by a band ofEgyptian nomads and hypnotized into thinking I was a warrior of the Sahara, but the gunshot snapped me out ofit, and now I'm back.
Do you have any coffee made?
Why, yes, Mom. There's a fresh pot on the stove.
(WATER BUBBLING) Sounds perfect, even though there's...
MALE VOICE:
"Hardly time to say a prayer
"Before we move on to the air"
What?
I'm going down to check master control.
Cue the commercial.
Billy!
See if anyone's in Studio B.
Billy, bring me a tomato, quick!
RICK:
Billy, find my tuba player.
DEXTER: Blue Sky.
Fresh as a spring rain.
Cool as a summer breeze.
Blue Sky has got the smoke that goes down smooth.
I told Dexter not to smoke.
If you ask me, they ought to put warnings on those packages.
It's not Dexter. It's coming from somewhere else.
It's coming from right here.
Someone's idea of ajoke?
Studio 13.
I'm gonna go see what's going on.
Penny, I'm only gonna say this once...
Hey, Mr. H, you're looking chipper.
Penny in the fishbowl?
I gotta talk to her.
Yeah, but I wouldn't talk to her before you finish...
Gork: Son ofFire. Don't get your pants in a bunch.
Penny, I'm only gonna say this once...
Let's get that pack of butts off stage and get the microphones out, boys.
MAX: Ready light cue, as you will.
There is an evil that lurks behind you.
TOM: Is it your shadow, or is it the Mind Bender?
Are you sure this is the right floor?
There's nobody up here, Mrs. Henderson. It's all right, Dottie.
Fred Smith, an ordinary man not unlike you or me, walks home on a fog-shrouded night.
This is the night when he will reach deep inside himself and discover the Mind Bender.
What's that sound I hear?
What do you think you're doing? Looking for you.
Well, you scared the bejesus out of me. Really?
Sounded like a squeal of delight to me.
Someone is fooling with an open mike on 13.
(SHUSHING) Look, ljust wanted to saythat I... ok3Y-
All right. Bad timing.
Look, you think after the show we could get a cup ofjava or something?
Roger. Keep trying, it'll come back to you.
Dead man.
Where?
SHERWOOD:
Strange eating habits, indeed.
Well, Maynard, tell us, which part of this Buick did you eat first?
With a little deviled egg, the lug nuts make wonderful appetizers.
Lug nuts.
Well, gentlemen, when you see the rest of the firepower that we have marshaled for you this evening,
I'm gonna expect you to do your duty and run out and enlist in my war against the other three networks.
My girlfriend and I...
Girlfriend, hey.
We're thinking about eating a bus together.
Won't that be scrumptious!
We'll do our best to check in with you then.
Call the police.
DEXTER: And now, the girl with the va-va-va-voom voice,
Claudette Katzenback!
(SINGING A GUY
WHAT TAKES HIS TIME)
The Genera|'s son just committed suicide.
Tough break.
Hate to lose that weak-kneed, lily-livered son of a...
Famous general, right, sir?
You're wanted in the General's office right away.
Mr. Station Manager, sir, you're supposed to rush down to the General's office right away.
Though being my boss and all, I suppose you can just slowly saunter if you want to.
Carry on.
DEXTER: That was the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl herself,
Claudette Katzenback.
All right, ladies and gents.
At 7:15 this evening, young Walt Whalen Junior was found hanging in an empty studio.
The apparent cause of death, suicide.
My son didn't have enough courage to commit suicide.
It was murder!
Maybe suicide, maybe murder. Either way, I'm missing my dinner.
It was murder, and I brought you here to find the killer.
And I don't want you to leave until you've done that.
Do you understand me,
Lieutenant?
Get my people out of here as soon as possible.
I've got a network to run.
Now, which of you...
You sent for me?
Maybe. Who are you?
I'm Claudette Katzenback, the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl with the va-va-va-voom voice.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Lieutenant Cross, the Chicago cop with the sh-sh-sh-short temper.
I'm here investigating a Mr. Walt Whalen Junior's death.
Walt? Dead?
No. Why didn't anybody tell me?
Not that I actually knew the man. I didn't.
I mean, he was a director, wasn't he?
I'd like to play poker with you sometime.
(SINGING I'LL BE GLAD
WHEN YOU'RE DEAD)
Which one of you is Penny Henderson? PENNY: That's me.
What do you do around here?
Just about everything, sir.
Shut up and sit down.
Okay.
I'm the General's secretary, sir.
My condolences.
You found the dead guy?
Up on the 13th floor.
See anybody else up there?
We just found
Walt hanging there.
I infer by your use ofthe plural that there was somebody else up there with you?
Not with me.
When I got up there, I saw Roger coming down the hall.
Roger!
So, you must be Roger.
Must I?
I've got one question for you, young man.
Why were you up there?
Did you have business in that studio? What were you doing?
Isn't that three questions?
Nothing, nothing.
I was looking for Penny.
To discuss a script.
He's a writer.
A writer? I hate writers!
They drink too much, they beat their wives...
Lieutenant!
What?
No, no. Not, "What? I didn't hear you." I mean, what!
What the hell is going on around here?
Somebody else died in Radioland tonight.
Why weren't we notified?
It was a trumpet player, but the doctor said it was just a heart attack.
The coroner says different. Says your trumpet player was murdered!
Pickled with an arsenic-and-gin cocktail.
COGLEY: That was rat poison.
He showed me Ruffles‘ flask.
Flask?
Roger had it.
Deja vu.
This is all very explainable, okay?
I was running by when they were carrying Ruffles‘ body offthe stage.
And he happened to drop his flask on my script, and ljust... ljust picked it up.
I don't suppose you still have it? No, no, of course not.
Why would I still have it?
Right here in my pocket, wherein all the confusion,
I forgot that I put it.
Careful! It might have fingerprints on it.
Fingerprints?
Of course there are fingerprints.
My fingerprints. I'm holding it, you idiot. Give me that!
Well, well, well. Roger's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.
Placed at the scene of Wha|en's death, and now he has the poison that killed poor Ruffles.
Hey...
Oh, pipe down, Dexter.
Roger may be a lot ofthings, but he's not a murderer.
She's right.
I'm not even a lot ofthings.
CROSS: I said, shut up and sit down.
You seem to know him pretty well, for a secretary.
Well, I'm his wife, too.
Ex-wife. Soon-to-be ex-wife.
We're getting divorced.
How come?
I couldn't trust him.
He lies.
PENNY: Not big lies.
One big lie. But he never lied about killing anyone.
That I know of.
I'll remember you when I need a character witness.
Isn't that what's referred to in police jargon as a lead?
Oh, put a sock in it, Dexter.
I happen to know that you had a fist fight with Juniorjust before he was killed.
Guess that makes you what we refer to in police jargon as a suspect.
Now you're talking!
Shut up.
And sit down, I know.
CROSS: Stay put, Mr. Morris.
We'd like to ask our suspect a few questions.
Don't wander too far,
Shakespeare!
You're next.
Thanks a lot!
(WHISPERING) I'm a suspect. Okay, Roger, I'm sorry.
It's a little late for that now!
That lunkhead copper's gonna want me on a carpet in a couple of minutes.
I gotta clear myself, and fast.
DEXTER: And now, here they are, America's favorite hosts...
All right.
Well, well, well.
Looks like Ruffles caught your good side.
You're double-jointed, huh?
This is all the proof! need.
Give me those!
You know, I'd kill to have pictures like these.
Maybe your husband would, too.
DEXTER: And now, that rip-roaring, rococo Romeo of ridiculous, roguish rigmarole and rhapsodic, rapier-like repartee,
Won't happen again,
Dexter.
...Rick Rochester and his Rascals of Rhythm.
I'll ream those writers.
Thank you! Yes!
MALE VOICE: "You hadn't a clue of what to do
"When you caught your falling star"
Well, that's a good idea.
You got a better one?
Check for open mikes.
Oh, that's original.
What the hell is wrong with my stage?
This can't be happening.
Not to my baby!
Looks like your baby needs a good whack in the axle.
Don't you touch my stage!
Somebody better do something about your big idea stage,
‘cause the band's a-going ‘round again.
I've got it!
Is it contagious?
Just don't give it to us.
No, no, no. I've solved the murder. Jeepers, Roger.
No, listen to me, Penny.
I know...
HERMAN: I know more about that stage than anyone.
Wait a minute, Katzenback,
I wanna talk to you!
Oh, wait a minute, Mr. H, lthinkthe cops want you upstairs.
GangW3YI
There must be a loose connection underneath the stage.
I will fix it!
Just shut offthe power to the turntable while I'm down there.
And find me someone to fire!
What? Oh, God.
Hold it, Herman.
We have some talking to do.
ROGER: Tough guy, huh?
Yes, sir, General, I know.
We need to get it fixed.
We're doing everything we can.
Roger.
I'll call you back.
What is going on here?
Herman?
What do you think,
Herman, huh?
Blackmail a good motive for murder?
You're crazy, Henderson.
My wife was fooling around with everyone and his dog. Even I know that.
Ruffles showed you these photos, then you killed Walt Junior for messing around with your wife.
HERMAN: You see. Yeah.
Yeah. See?
It's sabotage. Yeah.
German engineering could never be ruined by American pipe.
There it goes again.
I gave no...
Herman!
Perry, Perry, kill the revolve! We've got people under there!
Henderson, wait. I'm caught!
I've got to go down there. Let me go, please, please.
Pull me!
I'm pulling!
Henderson!
Henderson!
For God's sake, Henderson!
Henderson!
It's Katzenback!
Move out!
Oh, God, it's Herman!
He's... He‘s...everywhere!
Roger. Where's Roger?
If you find his diamond, I know he'd want me to have it.
They missed me. lthink I'll talk to the cops now.
DEXTER: WBN...
What happened?
Katzenback is mashed potatoes.
Dead?
Very.
When is this going to stop?
I see this as a classical tragedy in three acts. Act One,
Claudette and young
Walt Whalen Junior were indulging in some illicit sexercise.
Exhibit A.
Ruffles Reedy had the photos.
He was blackmailing them, threatening to go to C|audette‘s husband, Katzenback.
So Walt Junior put an end to Ruffles Reedy. He shut him up permanently with poison. Exhibit B.
Unfortunately...
Unfortunately...
Excuse me.
Unfortunately, he killed him too late.
Ruffles had already blown his tune to Katzenback.
Am I going too fast foryou, Lieutenant?
Yeah, you wise guy...
Act Two.
In a fit of insane jealousy,
Katzenback kills Walt Junior, his wife's young lover, which brings us to Act Three, the final act. The denouement.
Where Claudette, distraught, avenges Walt Junior's death by killing her husband,
Herman Katzenback. Lights down, curtain, thunderous applause.
Not bad, Sherlock.
ROGER: Anytime, chief.
I'm proud to have brought Claudette Katzenback to justice.
Though in a way,
I almost feel sorry for her.
You know, such a bitter, conniving, twisted personality.
I'll murder you, you little punk.
Though you gotta love her way around a show tune.
Lieutenant, he hates me because of a sillyjoke.
You see, I made his wife believe we were having an affair.
And this is his revenge.
Well, it wasjust a little joke, stupid!
Well, nobody‘s laughing, sister.
You don't know how much
I'm gonna hate saying goodbye to all you swell show biz people.
Watch your fingers.
The book's slamming shut on this case.
I slammed my fingers in a car door once.
Ouch.
Cuff her.
No! You mean, you're actually arresting me?
This is an outrage.
Penny...
Roger... Soldier, that was clear thinking under fire.
Thank you, sir.
How much do I pay you, anyway?
No, no. No, that's not necessary, sir.
I mean, I only make $40 a week and... Sounds about right. Dismissed.
We've lost our director and our station manager.
A new leader's got to come forward and take command.
Well, the troops will follow you anywhere, sir.
I'm talking about you, Henderson. You're the director.
You're the new station manager.
I know, I know, they're big shoes to fill, but I think she has the feet for the job.
I've got to go coddle King and the affiliates.
I'm depending on you to keep this network running.
Yes, sir.
At ease, Private.
Director.
Get back to your typewriter.
We got a lot of work to do.
Miss Henderson,
Miss Henderson! Hey, Mr. H.
What is it? Oh, Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick, the actors still don't have their scripts. What?
Yeah, and they're up right after Ben Butter‘s talking pig.
Well, get to the writers‘ room and get the scripts. Quick, come on.
Come on, clear the way.
All right, all right.
Come on, come on.
Hey, take her downtown.
Wonderful.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick is up in five minutes.
I know. Deirdre, get this to the actors. Is that the whole thing?
That ought to hold them till Billy gets down with the other pages.
MAN: And stay out!
We haven't been paid in three weeks, and we're not gonna rewrite any more pages until we are!
Am I making myself clear?
Sorry, I might be little on edge.
Come on, guys, you can't do this.
There are a lot of people waiting on those pages.
Will you quit fooling around? We have work to do. Now, come on.
Go chew a bone.
He's with me. Come on.
Give me those notes.
Here's your script.
One page?
Sorry.
Sorry?
This is pitiful.
MALE VOICE: "Beginnings and endings are easy
"But your words are twisted and wheezy"
What are those things? There's been three or four ofthem tonight.
Only three ofthem. Right before each ofthe murders.
I rememberthem, Mr. H. I remember them all, word for word.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
Well, when it comes to radio,
I'm kind of a Mr. Memory.
You know, I even remember the first thing lever heard on radio.
It was Kay Kornwall's
Kollege of Musical Komedy.
Kid! Just give me the first one, will you? Oh, right.
“Dig and dig to find some dirt
“Dig too deep and you'll get hurt“
“Dig and dig to find some dirt“
That could be Ruffles, right?
He was blackmailing everybody.
Kind of a reach, Mr. H.
Then there was,
“Hardly time to say a prayer
Before we move on to the air“.
Air. Heir! Heir. That could actually be “heir“ as the H-E-I-R.
The Genera|‘s heir, right?
Walt Junior.
And now, here's another thrilling episode of
Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick.
I've gone through this once already. But it's not any...
MAX:
Get their butts out there.
JOHNNY ACE:
Who do they think we are?
Go! Go!
They only have the one page ofthe script I wrote for them.
Better one than none.
Just another day in the life of Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick.
Except today was not an ordinary day.
I'll say.
Good morning, Johnny.
So, what's the latest?
Well, looks like we're in mid-case without a parachute, toots.
What? That's it?
That...
Oh, this will be good.
What should we do now,
Johnny?
Oh, brilliant improvisation.
It's hard to say.
A situation like this can fool you. lmean, you step up to the plate expecting a high, hard one.
The actors are improvising? lmean, just when you think you know who the killer is, lmean, just who you think it was, wasn't.
Katzenback!
Katzenback!
C|audette‘s the falling star he caught having an affair.
Keep it coming.
“Beginnings and endings are easy
“But your... But your words are twisted and wheezy“
Words, words...
Twisted and wheezy.
That's smoking?
Coughing? The...
Dexter!
Dexter!
What's Dexter got to do with it?
One minute, you're walking on water, and before you know it, you're all wet.
Oh, this is so sad.
Pathetic.
JOHNNY ACE: Well, never mind.
Dexter and everybody who left here in a hearse used to work with my dad back at WOWA in Peoria.
Till the FCC scandal broke it up. ScandaL
Yeah, and their bathrooms was just as dirty.
Coming in!
Shake a leg and zip it up.
WOWA.
Peoria.
Jumpin‘ Jehoshaphat!
Dexter is next!
And, toots?
Yes, Johnny?
You look after the office until I'm back.
Now we're in trouble.
Cue Dexter.
We'll return with the exciting adventure conclusion of
Johnny Ace, Hard-Boiled Dick in just a moment.
Dexter!
Dexter!
It's locked!
Dexter.
I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about Sunrise Surprise Coffee.
Dexter! Open the door! Open the door!
That rich, aromatic, flavorful way to start the day.
Dexter! Open the door!
Mmm.
Just one sip and you'll see what I mean when lsay...
Get the stand, will you?
Get the stand!
Then, on three. One, two...
Three?
What are you doing?
What in the...
Open up the...
The door!
It's not supposed to be locked.
Hey!
Cut it out!
Come on, come on.
Phil, call Doc Burman.
Everyone get back to work.
So I guess we'll be needing a new announcer, huh?
Go to Tom McCa||um‘s dressing room, tell him he‘sjust been promoted to announcer.
Tom McCa||um?
Now. ok3Y-
Oh, my God.
“Your words are twisted and wheezy“
That's you, Dexter.
I want a cop stationed at every exit of the studio.
Any man, woman, dog, cat or duck tries to leave, pull them and chain them to a desk.
You seen Tom McCa||um?
No.
Hey-
Whoa.
What?
Not again.
Dexter's dead.
It's another murder.
MAN: I'm going home. WOMAN: But the police won't let you.
You! Front and center.
I got ajob for you.
Yes, sir, General Whalen.
We'll have the new announcer up and running before you can...
Stow it, grunt.
I can't have any scuttlebutt about our latest casualty.
If the affiliates get word, they'll be out of here quicker than Shinola through a goose.
Do whatever you have to do to keep them in that room.
Boy, I love radio, but I love a good pee even more.
Open up!
I gotta go to the bathroom! An empty bott|e‘s always good in a pinch.
(SHUSHING) May I have your attention, please?
Quiet!
I know things have been a little crazy around here tonight, and you're all shook up.
Since we can't leave, and we still got ajob to do, we might as well do it and do it right.
Look, all I'm saying is, we're a team.
And we gotta trust the police to do theirjob and get back to caring about ours.
It's not ourjob to care.
It's everyone‘s job to care.
It's everyone‘s job to care.
Look, Penny's right.
We do still have ajob to do.
And believe me, pretty soon they're gonna nail this schizo, this nutsy, mad-dog fruitcake.
Henderson!
Come with me.
Obviously, there's been a mistake.
MAN: Murderer!
WOMAN: Yeah.
You're gonna talk ifl have to wring it out ofyou!
No! Please,
I can't take any more.
Go on, kid.
Spill the beans.
Well, I told you, it wasn't me.
But all four ofthose victims had something in common.
Yeah. They're all dead.
Besides that. They all worked together a few years ago at radio station WOWA in Peoria. Won't fly, Lindbergh. This is Chicago.
Peoria‘s a lot smaller than Chicago.
Look, I heard about an FCC scandal there.
Maybe someone's trying to kill them all to keep it quiet.
Yeah, and maybe the Easter Bunny craps colored eggs!
Listen to me, scribe.
You led me down the garden path with that Claudette broad.
But you were the one with Ruffles‘ flask.
You were the one who was up there hanging around with Walt.
You were the one with Katzenback when he got crushed into kibble.
And you were the one who just happened to get there in time to see Dexter light up like a Roman candle!
How do you explain all that?
I'm having an off day?
What about those recordings, huh? That mysterious voice?
I got two words of advice for you, punk.
Get a lawyer!
Wait a minute.
What mysterious voice?
MALE VOICE: "Across the wave
"You gathered your host
"To see them line up from ghost to ghost"
That one! That one!
That's the killer.
He's broken into the broadcast before each ofthe murders.
Those riddles tell you who's gonna be next.
Big deal.
You could have written them yourself.
You said they were recordings.
All right. All right.
You got 30 seconds to tell me what it means.
Hey! Hey! Now take it easy. Take it easy, fellas.
Just going to a typewriter.
It helps me think.
Thanks for the tan.
You're the engineers.
Have you tried everything?
It's not here, Penny.
That voice is not coming through any of our mikes or any of our studios.
Oh, well, I got news for you. It's being broadcast over our airwaves.
Penny, what are you trying to say?
You think this is my fault or Tommy's?
No! I don't care whose fault it is. Good. Then understand that the real problem is not where the voice is coming from.
Right.
It's who might die next.
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
“Gathered your host
“from ghost to ghost“
“Ghost to ghost.“
That could actually be coast to coast.
That's the radio station.
Right?
And, “Gathered your host,“ it's...
General Whalen.
He's the host.
He's gonna be killed next.
We'll see.
TOM: And now, celebrating his 100th year in show business,
Milt Lackey.
Here we go, Bernie.
The crown jewel.
Thank you. Thank you.
Open up!
I gotta go to the bathroom! lget up in the morning, and I read the obituary column.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) My name isn't in it, I have breakfast.
The day I see my name in it,
I'll still have breakfast.
I'm not leaving on an empty stomach.
General Whalen, I...
Hey, hey, hey.
Excuse me, General,
I'd like you to let two of my men accompany you to your office.
There's a...
Strong probability...
There's a remote possibility that you could be the killer's next target.
Me? Bull twaddle.
I'm staying right here, on the front line.
You know, General, being the law and all,
I got the authority to shut this three-watt circus down.
Humor me.
Jenkins, Muldoon, go with the General.
The rest of you come with me.
We're gonna take Mr. Henderson here someplace quiet where we're gonna have another little talk.
Cuff him. You can't do that, Lieutenant.
Shut up.
Lieutenant!
General.
MILT LACKEY: In what other business can a man my age walk out on the stage, smoke a cigar, tell a few jokes, sing a few songs and use the same color lipstick that Dolores del Rio uses?
Everybody wants to know when I'm gonna retire.
I'll never retire.
You think his parents beat him when he laughed?
Oh, I'm even gonna take my music with me.
Tommy, was that a smile?
Yeah. Take a look at this.
Max, Max, Max.
What? What?
Come, look, he's laughing.
Oh, my goodness.
Holy mackerel!
He's laughing.
Bernie King is actually laughing.
All right, come on. No, no, no. Wait a minute, Lieutenant.
Bernie King never laughs at anything.
All right. Come on, kid.
We got a lot to talk about.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Something‘s wrong up there.
The General was supposed to be in that booth till you took him out.
Bernie King's gonna be killed by mistake.
Oh, gee, I hate interrupting a man who's enjoying his own murder so much.
Let's go!
(GROANS) Oh, my foot!
That's it. The only thing lgot that still works.
Now that's great radio.
Yes. He's laughing, General.
Laughing?
Hey! That way! That way!
Spread out.
He couldn't have gone far.
Move it! Move it!
I guess he had a lot of laughs stored up.
He really loves it, sir.
What's next? Bring me that list of programs.
PENNY: Now?
Yes, now.
Retire.
Who'd support my mother and father?
Mr. King!
It's locked!
Hey! Put up your hands.
He's dying in there. We gotta break the glass. Use your gun.
Dying?
Use your gun!
Right.
I meant shoot it!
I know that.
You...
Give me that.
Give me that.
Tell you what... Okay.
What are you...
MILT LACKEY:
Thank you very much.
I'm out of bullets.
Go get Cross, will you?
Quick, get out of here.
Mr. King.
Henderson.
Yes.
Those jokes stink!
ROGER: Mr. King.
Mr. King!
He's dead, Lieutenant.
It must be nitrous oxide.
Laughing 935-
Get a doctor, Mahoney. Wipe that smile from off your face.
This is murder.
(LAUGHING) Cuff him, boys.
Okay, Henderson, no more funny stuff.
It's the gas, Lieutenant.
The laughing caves in yourwindpipe.
It's a long, painful, ugly way to die.
Put a lid on it, Henderson.
Murder may be a big joke to you, but not to me and not to my men.
We'll probably get the chair.
ROGER: Deirdre.
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Where's Penny?
She's with the General.
Tell her I love her.
General, Roger Henderson just killed Bernie King.
That's ridiculous.
We caught him red-handed, miss.
He can't be dead.
He's our biggest sponsor.
Not that it wouldn't be a tragedy if he wasn't.
Henderson, let's march.
General, I reallythink you better stay up here.
GENERAL: I don't take orders from sergeants.
Men, I understand the gravity of the situation.
I will treat every step as if it could be my last.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my gosh.
No time to faint.
The first thing I want to know is... Lieutenant!
The Genera|‘s been murdered.
I knew it!
I mean,
I didn't really know it.
How could I? Really?
Look out?
What does that mean?
You scoundrel.
Take that. Take that.
Sic him, lads!
I have to go to the powder room. JACK: Great timbers.
Well, I wonder where he came from.
WOMAN: Where am I?
Don't worry, young lady, you're safe now.
Oh, thank you... ljust can't believe it.
One minute, he's standing right next to me. And the next minute, whoosh!
SERGEANT:
Hey, Lieutenant. Lieutenant.
Look at these scratches.
Something was tampering with the controls.
What's this?
Thank you, Jack. That was the bravest rescue I've ever seen.
I don't have time for fear, ma'am.
That's why they call me
Jack Granite, man's man.
This is a nightmare, Max.
I know we're all a little bit jumpy right now.
Could Roger have...
VVhy?
Well...
It doesn't make sense.
No.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Really?
Look, I have a new lead.
Well, so do we.
What?
Believe this belongs to you.
Found it at the bottom ofthe elevator shaft where the controls were tampered with.
No, I'm...
I must have dropped it somewhere, you know?
Really? Maybe you dropped this, too, huh?
Found it clutched in Walt Whalen Junior's hand.
Looks like he grabbed it from somebody just before he got hung.
No, now, hold it. I've seen that knife before and I...
Where the hell have I seen it?
Roger.
Penny!
No, no, it's all right.
It's all right. Go ahead.
Penny. What in the world is going on, Roger?
What? Tell me something. Tell me anything.
Look, I didn't do anything.
You gotta try harder.
I didn't do anything!
Penny, please,
I'm begging you.
You have to believe me.
Nobody else will.
I didn't kill anybody. But I'm very close to figuring out who did. Okay?
Who did it then?
Okay. Okay-
I'm not sure. But it involves an FCC scandal and a merger and radio station WOWA in Peoria.
Three strikes and you're out, Houdini.
We're gonna be leaving now,
Mrs. Henderson.
You can tell your crew it's finally over.
But...
You're a writer, Henderson.
Time for you to write something for me.
What?
A confession.
I killed them.
Yes. Yes. I killed them all.
Why'd you do it, kid?
Why? You wanna know why?
Because I hate doing rewrites!
Watch out!
All right.
Stand back, men.
Give him room.
Rewrites! Polishes! Gags! I mean, they always want more gags.
And then they read them wrong, anyway!
They all laughed at me.
I'm just the writer.
They thought they were better than me, but they weren't!
They're just cockroaches!
And what do you do with cockroaches?
You squash them, squash them, squash them, squash them, squash them!
And you think that's all?
No, no, no.
I've killed dozens.
I've got names, dates, all the evidence you could possibly want.
CROSS: Where?
Upstairs in my desk.
All right.
All right, now.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Calm down. Calm down.
We're gonna go upstairs, we're gonna have a nice little talk.
Penny, are you all right?
Everything‘s falling apart, Max.
People dying-
Roger being arrested for murder. ljust can't believe it.
I mean, the second I met him, it was like he'd been there my whole life.
Right from the start.
It's like, I don't know...
An old sweater or something.
You know?
Warm and comfortable and familiar.
We met for lunch, and we were best friends before they could take our order.
It was like we had so much in common.
We laughed at the same things.
We thought about the same things.
I don't know what to think.
I thought I knew him.
I couldn't have been that wrong about him. Could I?
You want a straight answer?
No. Yes.
Penny, now, you know that Roger is not a maniac killer.
Roger is not organized enough to order dinner, let alone plan six murders.
And as for Claudette, oh, come on. I saw them...
No, what you saw was a crazy woman throwing herself at an innocent bystander.
Number one, Roger loves you.
Number two, Claudette has tried to jump on every man in this building at one time or another.
Believe me.
Smart of you, cooperating with the police.
It'll look good in court.
Come on, son. Be a man.
Okay.
That's it.
Paychecks!
Paychecks!
Paychecks, everybody!
CROSS: Stand back!
Don't interfere!
This man just confessed to murder!
WOMAN: Where's my overtime?
You'll never take me alive, coppers. Never!
Don't jump or I'll shoot!
Don't look.
Kid's lost it.
Go downstairs.
Find what's left of him.
JASPER: Yes, sir. Let's go.
What a bunch of nimrods.
Let's find him.
Where the hell is he?
SERGEANT: I don't see him.
Oh, there he is! Up there!
Stop or we'll shoot!
He's got a gun.
Agun?
Now we'll never get our money.
Hey!
SERGEANT: Give up, kid!
Hold your fire.
I'm gonna get the Lieutenant.
Jump, Roger, jump!
Atta baby, go!
Hey, stay where you are!
Max, I'm getting some voltage fluctuation here.
Oh, God.
This guy's good.
I can't believe I did that.
Hey, did you hear?
Mr. H escaped!
Search the room, lads.
Over here. Come on.
He's not here, sir.
Call headquarters and get more men up here.
We're gonna have to search every square inch ofthis building.
He's got a gun, sir.
Shoot to kill.
So you have to realize that there's a lot of work that really goes into a radio station...
Excuse me, young man.
Excuse me.
Yes, killer penguin,
Studio 10.
Mrs. Henderson dropped these papers. They may be important.
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll get them to her for you.
See, you gotta understand they let me in the booth anytime I want.
Hello.
Where you can pop, pop, pop your troubles away.
Slide in, relax.
And remember, even a busy modern gal needs to be squeaky clean for her man.
Penny? Penny-
Oh, cue the band. Cue Anna.
Cue band. Anna, go.
Miss Henderson, some penguin told me you dropped this.
BILLY: You know, I heard that they have orders to shoot Mr. H on sight.
That's crazy.
Can you live without me for a few minutes, Max?
Sure. Penny, be careful.
Remember, there's a killer loose out there.
Billy.
Don't scream. Don't scream.
Don't scream. It's me.
Roger?
Take my head off.
What in the sam hill...
Are you completely out of your mind?
Okay, okay, so I'm suspected of six grisly murders.
There's no reason not to be civil.
Lieutenant Cross has his men everywhere. They're looking for you.
We shouldn't even be up here. I know. I know, Penny.
I had to talk to you before, you know, something happened.
Are you cold?
I brought your scarf.
No, no, no.
You know, penguins, we're used to it. lthink... lthink...
No, you go first.
You go first.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We're talking at the same time.
Married people do that.
Penny. Penny.
You remember our first time up here? Yes.
Remember when we sneaked up here, we brought that champagne?
We stared up at that tower, and we figured out how we could talk to the whole world through radio, you know.
You know, take the people anywhere we wanted.
Yeah.
I don't know if you even believe I'm innocent.
But I love you.
I do.
I better go.
Your head.
Don't lose your head.
Oh.
Roger, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna break into the file room. What?
No, no, no. Penny, come on. Listen to me.
All the victims were involved in something over at WOWA.
I'm gonna get to the bottom ofthis bucket of clams.
Roger,
I'll get you the key to the file room.
No.
Why not?
No. Penny, no. This is murder, and I don't want you involved, you know, when I do get caught.
Okay, penguin, hands up!
Which is right now.
Don't shoot!
He's got a gun!
What are you talking about?
I don't have a gun. Yes, you do. I'm his hostage.
No. Oh, my hostage!
Of course you are.
Now, stay back!
Stay back, I tell you, or we'll both go over.
No!
Now, |et‘sjust put that gun down. Put it down!
I'm putting it down.
I'm putting it down.
Put your hands up. Put your hands up. Yeah.
And throw that gun over here.
Come on, throw it over here!
Stay back!
Stay back, cop, or I'll let her have it.
I'll let her have it.
I'll hurt her.
Okay, okay.
So, now I'm involved. See?
Fiftieth floor, maintenance closet, 10 minutes.
We don't have to rewrite this script.
King's dead!
Is that okay with you, Jules?
He seems to be okay with it.
I want you to start up on the roof and work your way down floor by floor.
He's wearing a penguin suit. Well, get going.
A penguin shouldn't be hard to spot.
Right, sir.
PENNY: Billy Budget, report to the control booth immediately.
Billy, report to the control booth.
Wait a minute, that's me.
Now!
You called, Miss Henderson?
Don't move!
Don't shoot!
Please, he's one of us.
Please.
Billy...
TOM: That concludes tonight's presentation ofSentimenta| Whispers.
I'd love to know whose idea this was. I could kill him.
Get this to the top writer.
Jules? He's out cold.
Our best writer.
But that's Mr...
Oh! Yeah, sure. You got it.
Keep up the good work, fellas.
You know, I was thinking about... Now!
Mr. H! Mr. H!
Hey, Mr. H! Wait a minute!
Billy!
Get back here!
Billy?
Where the hell is he?
Conchita.
You know,
I was looking for a penguin,
(GROANS) but I guess I got a couple of minutes.
It's me, you chowder-head.
What are you doing here?
Geez Louise,
Mr. H! It's you!
You sure got some great melons.
Sorry, just trying to lighten a serious situation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where's Penny?
The cops are on her like red on an apple.
She sent me to give you this.
She's a pip-
Nice work, kid.
Keep your nose clean.
Don't tell anyone you've seen me. Now beat it.
Well, golly, Mr. H?
Can't I stay with you?
No.
Help you on your quest to right this terrible wrong? I mean, every hero needs a little sidekick.
No, no. I'm no hero.
Well, sure you are.
No, no, I'm not.
Sure you are.
Knock it off!
Sorry. Come on, the way you've been fighting back when the chips are down, for your life, your best gal.
To a young person like myself, desperately in need of a role model, you're an inspiration.
Maybe you're right. Let's go.
This is great. The spotlight ofjustice has fallen on me.
And together, we will thwart the dastardly minions of crime.
Oh, can it, will you, kid? Nobody talks like that in real life.
Got you, boss. Let's cut the ham out ofthe club sandwich.
What's the skinny, compadre?
Come here.
What are you doing?
Tonight on Ungawa, the Jungle Boy, can Ungawa save
Dr. Ashton-Reeves, his trusted
English benefactor, when they are outnumbered by a hair-raising horde of horrible headhunters?
REEVES: lsay, old chap.
Appears to be a bit of a sticky wicket ahead.
Easy for you to say, eh?
What?
So, this is the tomb ofAnarkali.
WOMAN: It's too dark in here.
I can't see a thing.
MAN 1: lknow it's in here.
It has no shape, no body.
MAN 2: It wants to do to us, what it did to Dr. Anton when he opened the tomb.
It's here! It's ripping the skin off my body!
Help me, Reginald, please!
Hold this.
MAN 2: Please!
Jeepers, Mr. H, you sure we're doing the right thing here?
Oh, take it easy, kid. Look, how long have we known each other anyway?
Six days. Exactly. There's a bond there.
Wait a minute.
“Misce||aneous.“
Found it!
WOWA list of employees.
FCC scandal.
Where's the light switch?
I'll get it.
What's in here?
That's the file room.
It's locked.
It was the killer.
I saw him. He was...
Horrible!
He was a tall guy and short, too.
And he was wearing this really nice suit.
Though it was kind of shabby.
And he had blackish, brownish, reddish, blondish, kind of, whitish hair.
And he definitely went downstairs, or maybe it was up.
Busy, bUSY-
(SINGING DON'T LET
YOUR LOVE GO WRONG)
Uh-huh.
All right. Perfect!
I don't know what happened to Billy.
Ten minutes to the last show, we don't have a script.
And this differs from the other six times this has happened tonight in what way, exactly?
The writers have left the building. Good answer.
I don't get it.
It's gotta be somebody who's still alive.
Wait a minute.
He's the one! Ssh.
That's where
I saw that knife.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I mean, like, why him?
How am I gonna tell anybody without getting filled full of lead?
TOM: Gork: Son of Fire!
Yeah, I'll get to it.
I'll get to it.
That script‘s not finished yet.
(MAN CHATTERING
OVER MICROPHONE)
Look, he almost killed someone else up on the roof.
I don't give a rat's behind where you pull them from!
I want at least two more squads up here.
With tear gas, riot guns and dogs!
Roger hates dogs.
All right, little lady,
I got one question for you.
What exactly were you doing up on that roof in the first place?
Doing? Me?
I was just getting a little fresh air.
Hey, do you hear something?
Yeah.
He's on a ledge outside Rehearsal Room 3.
Let's go. I don't want him falling again unless I push him.
Attention, all personnel.
Attention. The police have located the killer.
I repeat, they've located the killer.
What does she think she's doing?
They've cordoned off
Rehearsal Room number 3.
Thanks, kiddo.
We can all relax now and get back to work.
ALL: All right!
TOM: In a moment,
Gork: Son of Fire, after this.
Control booth.
Billy, it's for you.
Me? A phone call for me, here?
Well, it must be pretty important.
Hello, Billy Budget here.
MAN: Do you want to help Roger Henderson?
Sure. Sure I do.
Then make contact with the Latin bongo player in the eighth floor broom closet.
Gotcha. I'm on it.
Well, who was it?
It was, The Tribune.
They want to sell me a subscription.
I'm gonna think about it.
Mr. H! Good disguise.
Look, you gotta give these pages to Penny, pronto.
It's the first part of the Gork script.
Tell her I'll finish the rest as soon as I can.
Now go.
What atrouper, Mr. H.
Wanted for murder, forced to wear a series of humiliating disguises, and you still find time to do yourjob.
I'm a memory.
...invites you to go back in time a million years, to the thrilling adventures of
Gork.’ Son ofFire. Gork.’ Son ofFire has arrived!
Where‘d you get this?
A certain unnamed writer who said the rest is on the way. Is he okay?
Well...
Go get this to the actors.
We're on the air.
Billy!
Slow down.
Five bucks says he makes it in 10 seconds. You got it.
Come on, Billy, come on.
Who's got my script, huh?
Who's got my script?
Out ofthe way!
Out ofthe way!
MAN: What are we going to do?
This is crazy.
I can't do this.
Lines!
Yeah!
Lost again.
Gork.’ Son of Fire!
Fighting the terrifying
20-ton tyrannosaurus.
(IMITATING TYRANNOSAURUS GROWLING) One name stands out above them all.
Lightning strikes as Gork proudly drags home a pterodactyl after his daily hunt.
Oh, what's this?
Odd metallic object in cave.
Not rock. Cold, shiny.
It have place to sit.
Gork sit.
It's a time machine, and Gork has accidentally activated it.
The caveman is transported through centuries, hurtling through eons of time.
Until he at last finds himself standing in his mastodon robes and dinosaur headdress in the middle ofa large metropolitan radio station.
What the...
Radio station?
I don't know what's going on.
What the hell was that little announcement about, Mrs. Henderson?
Listen!
Six brutal murders have been committed in the station.
Judging by the offbeat way...
Grok?
Gork.
Gork dresses, I...
It's not making much sense.
Should I cue in a commercial?
Oh, no. Let it play, Max.
I think he's trying to tell us something. So am I.
You've just made yourself an accomplice, Mrs. Henderson.
ACTOR 1: He sure smells like a dead animal.
ACTOR 2: The way! figure, anyone who dresses like that is either a nut or a killer.
GORK: Gork no kill.
Gork peace-loving caveman.
Must unmask real killer.
Clear self. Find way back to prehistoric wife. Convince her to stay married.
Wild guess, those are Roger's pages?
Maybe Lieutenant Cross evolved enough to listen to truth.
That's me.
They're talking about me.
Gork know about crime,
Lieutenant.
Gork grow up in rough neighborhood.
Fifty million people are hearing my name, huh?
I hate cavemen almost as much as I hate radio writers and missing my dinner.
Gork not sure he have solution right on tip of fingers or tip of tongue or on top ofhead.
POLICEMAN: Hey, you!
Maybe Lieutenant have a few questions for Gork.
Questions? No,
I don't have any questions.
Take it easy. This is your baby, Neanderthal.
Either you know who the killer is or you don't.
It's not like the answers are suddenly gonna drop out of the sky.
That's him!
Watson, I want more men backstage.
A very cluttered time machine.
I got it, I got it.
I got it, I got it.
Gork see photograph of six victims.
Gork find link between six at radio station in Peoria.
No, no, no.
Get back! Get back!
Might say, missing link.
Don't let me die!
It's him!
The killer!
Let's get out of here.
Get me that writer.
Get me that writer.
You can't stop now.
We're still on the air.
Billy! Get them back on.
Max, tell me that wasn't Roger.
Okay, that wasn't Roger.
Come on, get back there.
I'll figure something out.
So, this all started with Ruffles, who got poisoned with his own hooch.
Who's Ruffles?
Can't you follow anything?
Next come Walt Junior, man who wear animal pelt on head.
Then useless station manager,
Mr. Katzenback.
At this point, it seemed like a love triangle.
But then Dexter, the announcer, was fried by his microphone.
That was a cruel one.
There he is!
Finally, laughing gas meant for both General Whalen and Bernie King.
What a way to go.
So, the elevator was a last-minute change ofplan.
Victims all worked together before along with one more person, the killer.
Don't make me do it!
Okay, I tell you who killer is now.
Only one person had know-how to put mystery recordings on air and pearl-handle pocketknife he always carry.
Penny... He must be going somewhere with this. lpoint to him with club.
The killer is our sound engineer,
Max Applewhite.
I always like
Roger's writing.
He takes chances.
You see? You see?
It wasn't me.
It was Max!
Of course it's him. It was Max Applewhite, clear as a bell.
Max?
Wait a minute. Back!
Back to the control booth!
Who's Max Applewhite?
Stop it, Max, please.
No! Stop! No!
No, stop it!
Max!
Get out! No.
TOMMY: It's Max! He's gone crazy. Get out of the way.
That's right, it was me, Max Applewhite.
I killed them all. I wanted to destroy the network.
Destroy the network?
Max, but why?
Destroy the network?
But why, Max?
ACTOR: Because those people destroyed me. Because they destroyed me.
How?
WOMAN: How?
MAX: They were all stockholders in WOWA
15 years ago, and they all lied to me!
I could have had the patent.
I could have had the patent, but I needed their money to prove that my ideas worked.
And I trusted...
God, I could just kill them!
Well, I did kill them.
But I never meant to frame Roger.
It's just that he made it so damn easy! lgot him!
SERGEANT: Let me in there.
Shut up!
You see, I was an inventor.
MAX: lbelieve I came up with the greatest single invention of the 20th century.
What invention?
But when those people in Peoria saw that I could really do it, they became afraid.
And they took all my designs, and they locked them in a safe, and they told me that I couldn't work on them anymore, because they owned them!
Do you believe that?
Well, tell me, do they own me?
Do they own this audience?
Do they own Chicago?
The world?
I gotta start using the stairs.
Well, do they own this?
Or this?
What are you doing?
MAX: Or this?
Scripts?
PEN NY: Please, Max!
Time to go!
Where are we going?
It's a surprise!
I'm a professional.
I'm not supposed to ad lib.
ACTOR 1: Go with the flow.
There's nobody here.
Is there any other way out of here? No.
Yes. Yes, the wiring chute.
There's a ladder up to the roof.
Both you follow them.
We'll meet you up on the roof.
Well, we're still on the air.
But they're out of script pages.
Get me the air corps.
That's our Billy!
How goes it?
Name, Little Spark.
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Gork's sidekick from cave down road.
Well...
Gork have hands full with modern problems.
So I finish story, how he solve murder and he get back to easier time of volcanoes, earthquakes, warring tribes and ferocious, man-eating dinosaurs!
You all right?
CROSS: You two guys, go upstairs! Right, sir.
Where's Penny?
That Applewhite character got her on top ofthe roof.
The roof?
What are you talking...
Move!
Okay.
Gork make ultimate sacrifice.
And send for help on prehistoric tom-tom.
Gork not so sure
Gork like idea.
Hang in there, Gork.
Go on! Move!
Okay!
What is all this, Max?
This is my little sanctuary.
It's my lab where I've been creating the future.
Come on, where'd he go? Penny!
Which way...
Penny!
Where is he?
What's that?
Television.
I created it over 25 years ago.
Oh, I know everybody‘s working on it now, but my design is still the best.
They wanted to destroy it, so I hid it.
They'll never find us in here.
Roger!
Penny!
Don't, don't, don't, Max!
Don't do it.
You're not going anywhere,
Applewhite.
You just told 50 million people that you're the killer.
Well, you won't get me.
Back out!
Come on, Max.
I'll kill her!
Well, take me, Max.
Take me instead.
Wait, listen to me.
We both love Penny.
We don't wanna see her get hurt.
And you probably don't even like me, right?
So it'll be easier for you to kill me.
What am I saying?
What are you saying?
I don't know. Come on, Max.
No, Max. It's okay. Come on.
Thanks. This will be easier.
Always glad to help.
Climb.
No. No! ok3Y-
Max, Roger's afraid of heights.
MAX: I'll remember that.
Well?
I sent for reinforcements.
There's nobody left.
Shut up.
MAX: Go!
ROGER: Okay, okay.
You know, Max, I'm not so sure this is the best way out of here, but where are we going?
To heaven, Roger.
We're going to heaven.
It's quite a climb.
Yes, it is.
Let's go.
You know, Max, it's kind of brisk up here. Why don't we just go back?
I can't go back!
Why not?
Because I've seen the future.
What are you talking about?
Television.
Come on, Max.
Up! okall. okay_
Up. up. UP!
O kay, 0 Kall-
Max, what is that?
Run for it, kid!
What? What do you mean,
“Run for it“?
He's gonna kill my husband!
Max. Max!
He's crazy!
Max, no!
Radio is over!
Thank you again, Major.
We couldn't have done it without you.
Okay, goodbye.
Are you okay?
Yeah. And you?
Yeah.
I can't believe he killed people over this.
Radio was his life. How could he think it was over?
He was just wrong.
He was wrong, that's how.
I mean, radio will never die.
It would be like killing the imagination.
Oh, my gosh.
We're still on the air.
Poor Tommy.
Let's go and scrape what's left of that psycho-killer from offthe pavement.
Hey! I'm talking to you guys.
Billy!
Five more minutes.
We're short. What do we do?
I don't know.
Have them do the commercial again.
What are you doing?
Well...
Mrs. Henderson. Great lineup of shows. Oh, really? Thank you.
I think I speak for all the affiliates when I say we're all pleased as punch to be on board.
Thank you. Well, I'm sorry, but I have to get back to the booth.
Keep up the good work!
Are you okay?
DEIRDRE: We did it.
Billy saved the show.
Great. Oh, cue Tom.
Oh, cue Tom.
Cue Tom.
Quite a day.
Yeah.
Yeah, but just remember, today is the first day ofthe next part of your life you haven't lived yet.
Roger...
It's a slogan I wrote.
I know, I know, it needs a little work, but...
From all of us here at WBN, good night to everyone in Radioland!
Can we just go home?
Do you mean it?
You really are the only guy for me.
I know.
‘‘I know‘‘?
What? What did I do now? Oh, nothing. Forget about it.
ROGER OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
What? What gives with you?
I was 1,000 feet up in the air with a madman, risking my life for you, and you say forget it.
PENNY: Oh, well, nobody asked you to. I would have gone, but, oh, no,
Mr. Marvel has to go.
I did it because I love you!
You love me? Well, what about how much I love you?
Oh, oh. So what you're saying is that you love me more than I love you?
Oh, you're impossible!
Oh, you're impossible!
ANNOUNCER: And that's it from WBN in Chicago.
If it wasn't clear before it's certainly clear now.
There'll never be anything quite like radio!
Once upon a time in a faraway land... a young prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired... the prince was spoiled, selfish and unkind.
But then, one winter's night... an old beggar woman came to the castle... and offered him a single rose... in return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance... the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances... for beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away... to reveal a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late... for she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast... and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form... the beast concealed himself inside his castle... with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The rose she had offered... was truly an enchanted rose... which would bloom until his 21 st year.
If he could learn to love another... and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell... then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed... to remain a beast for all time.
As the years passed... he fell into despair and lost all hope... for who could ever learn to love a beast?
Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town full of little people
Waking up to say
There goes the baker with his tray like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
- To this poor provincial town
- Good morning, Belle.
- Morning, monsieur.
- Where you off to?
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story...
- about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
- That's nice.
Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up!
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your family
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your wife
- I need six eggs
- That's too expensive
There must be more than this provincial life
- Ah, Belle!
- Good morning.
- I've come to return the book I borrowed.
- Finished already?
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?
Not since yesterday.
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.
That one?
But you've read it twice!
Well, it's my favourite!
Far-off places... daring sword fights, magic spells, a prince in disguise.
If you like it all that much, it's yours.
- But, sir!
- I insist.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
- With a dreamy, far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle
Oh
Isn't this amazing
It's my favourite part
Because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him
Till chapter three
Hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Now it's no wonder that her name means beauty
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
- You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!
- I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you...
- and no girl, for that matter.
- It's true, Lefou.
And I've got my sights set on that one.
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one!
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But she...
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- I know, but...
That makes her the best!
- And don't I deserve the best?
- Well, of course! I mean, you do!
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle
Look, there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute
- Bonjour
- Good day
- You call this bacon
- What lovely grapes
- Some cheese
- Ten yards
- Excuse me - I'll get the knife - Please let me through
- This bread, it's stale - Those fish, they smell - Madame's mistaken
There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife
Look, there she goes, a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston, may I have my book, please?
How can you read this?
There's no pictures!
Well, some people use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books... and paid attention to more important things.
Like me.
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking.
- Gaston, you are positively primeval.
- Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern...
- and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.
- What's wrong with her? -
She's crazy. - He's gorgeous!
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.
Goodbye.
That crazy old loon!
He needs all the help he can get.
Don't talk about my father that way!
Yeah! Don't talk about her father that way!
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius!
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?
I- I'm a... I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk.
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!
I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work!
Yes, you will, and you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow.
- Hmph!
- And become a world-famous inventor.
- You really believe that?
- I always have.
Well, what are we waitin' for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.
Hand me that... the... the... the dog-legged clincher there.
So, did you have a good time in town today?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know. It's just that
I'm not sure I fit in here.
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
H- He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome, all right, and rude and conceited and...
- Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
- Well, don't you worry...
'cause this invention's gonna be the start of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
- It works!
- It does?
- It does!
- You did it!
You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!
Goodbye, Papa.
Good luck!
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.
We should be there by now.
Maybe we missed a turn.
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.
No. Let's go this way.
Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Back up, back up, back up!
Good boy! Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!
Steady, steady, now.
Steady.
Steady. No, Philippe!
Philippe?
Oh.
Help!
Is... Is someone there?
Help!
Oh!
Wha... Oh!
Hello?
Hello!
Poor fellow must have lost his way in the woods.
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.
Is someone there?
Not a word, Lumiere.
Not one word!
I- I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse... and... and I need a place to stay for the night.
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
Shh!
O- O-Ow! Ow! Ow!
Of course, monsieur, you are welcome here.
Who said that?
Over here.
- Where?
- Hello.
Incredible!
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.
Splendid! Just peachy!
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once!
Stop that! Hee-hee-hee.
Stop that, I say!
Sir, close that at once!
- Do you mind?
- I-I beg your pardon?
It's... It's just that I've never seen a clock that...
Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur.
Come.
Warm yourself by the fire.
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!
You know what the master will do if he finds him here.
I demand that you stop right there!
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!
I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this!
Well, hello there, boy.
- Oh, what service!
- All right!
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...
Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.
No! No tea. No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama!
Oh! Hello!
Uh-oh.
There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so...
Master, I'd like to take this moment to say...
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I- I-I was lost in the woods and...
- You are not welcome here!
- I-I-I'm sorry.
- What are you staring at?
- N-Nothing.
So, you've come to stare at the beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
I- I just needed a place to stay.
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day.
I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.
First I better go in there and propose to the girl.
And you, Lefou, now, when
Belle and I come out that door...
Oh, I know! I know!
I- I strike up the band!
- Not yet!
- Sorry.
Oh!
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day...
This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty!
Here. Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs.
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?
No, Belle.
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.
- Do you know who that little wife will be?
- Let me think.
- You, Belle.
- Gaston, I'm...
I'm speechless.
I really don't know what to say.
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but... but I just don't deserve you!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife.
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy!
Is he gone?
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it
Madame Gaston his little wife
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it
I want much more than this provincial life
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned
Philippe! What are you doing here? Where's...
Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Papa!
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we?
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
- Pet the pooch!
- I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Papa? Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama.
I saw her.
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What...
A girl!
I saw a girl in the castle!
See, I told ya!
Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy eared, slack-jawed...
Papa?
Did you see that?
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!
- She has come to break the spell!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Papa?
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait!
I'm looking for my father. I...
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
I- Is anyone here?
- Belle?
- Papa!
- H-H-How did you find me?
- Oh, your hands are like ice.
- We have to get you out of there.
- Belle, I want you to leave this place.
- Who's done this to you?
- No time to explain.
- You must go. Now!
- I won't leave you.
- What are you doing here?
- Run, Belle!
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
- Can't you see he's sick?
- Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
Oh, there must be some way
I can... Wait!
- Take me instead.
- You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no! You don't know what you're doing!
If I did, would you let him go?
Yes, but you must promise to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
- You have my word.
- Done!
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.
- Wait! -
Belle! - Wait!
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out.
Please let me out!
Let me out!
Please! Please!
- Master?
- What?
Uh, since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time...
I was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
- I didn't get to say goodbye.
- I'll show you to your room.
My room?
But I thought...
- You wanna... You wanna stay in the tower?
- No.
Then follow me.
- Say something to her.
- Huh? Oh.
I, uh, hope you like it here.
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like except the west wing.
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything, my servants will attend you.
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with the wrong man.
- No one says no to Gaston!
- Darn right!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more than I can bear.
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never!
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favourite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard
To see why
No one's
Slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect
A pure paragon
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
No one's
Been like Gaston a kingpin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston
As a specimen yes, I'm intimidating
My, what a guy that Gaston
Give 5 hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips
Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips
No one
Fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one as burly and brawny
As you see
I've got biceps to spare
- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
- That's right!
And every last inch of me's covered with hair
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
I'm especially good at expectorating
- Ptooey!
- Ten points for Gaston
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge
No one
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers in all of my decorating
My, what a guy
Gaston
- Help! Someone help me!
- Maurice?
Please! Please, I need your help.
He's got her... He's got her locked in the dungeon!
- Who?
- Belle. We must go.
Not... Not a minute to lose.
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!
- Is it a big beast?
- Huge!
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly!
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes! Will you help me?
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.
You will? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Crazy old Maurice.
He's always good for a laugh.
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking
- A dangerous pastime
- I know
But that wacky old coot is Belle's father
And his sanity's only so-so
Now, the wheels in my head have been turning
Since I looked at that loony old man
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle
And right now
I'm evolving a plan
- If I...
- Yes?
- Then we...
- No, would she?
- Guess!
- Now I get it!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
No one
Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots like Gaston
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston
So his marriage we soon will be celebrating
My, what a guy
Gaston
Will no one help me?
- Who is it?
- Mrs Potts, dear.
I thought you might like a spot of tea.
But you're...
You're a...
- Oh! Careful.
- This is impossible!
I know it is, but here we are.
I told you she was pretty, Mama, didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now.
- Don't spill.
- Thank you.
Wanna see me do a trick?
- Chip!
- Oops, sorry.
That was a very brave thing you did, my dear.
- We all think so.
- But I've lost my father... my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me... jabberin' on while there's a supper to get on the table.
- Chip?
- Bye!
Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers.
Oh, how embarrassing!
Ahem.
Ah, here we are!
You'll look ravishing in this one!
That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner.
Ah, but you must!
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.
Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Oh, try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day.
Master, have you thought that perhaps... this girl could be the one to break the spell?
Of course I have!
I'm not a fool.
Good!
So, you fall in love with her... she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.
But the rose has already begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!
Oh, you must help her to see past all that.
I don't know how.
Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.
Ah, yes. When she comes in, give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come.
Show me the smile.
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.
And above all, you must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who? Oh, ha ha ha!
The girl, yes. The girl.
Well, actually, she's in the process of...
Circumstances being what they are...
Uh, she's not coming.
What!
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence!
Let's not be hasty!
- I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
- I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong, but that may not be... the best way to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!
Suave, genteel.
It would give me great pleasure... if you would join me for dinner.
And we say please.
- Please.
- No, thank you.
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch at the door... and inform me at once if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me, mon capitaine.
Well, we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she refuses.
Wh-Wh-What...
What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad once you get to know him.
- Why don't you give him a chance?
- I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want to have anything to do with him.
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me as anything... but a monster.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
I've been burnt by you before.
Zut alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long, and for what?
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn!
After all, he did say please.
But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper, he'll never break the...
Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.
- This is Lumiere.
- Enchanté, chérie.
If there's... stop that... anything we... please... can do... to make your stay more comfortable...
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?
Hear that?
She's hungry!
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Oh, pish tosh! I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine. Glass of water, crust of bread and then...
Cogsworth,
I am surprised at you!
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest!
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.
If the master finds out about this, it will be our necks.
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner without a little music?
Music?
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure... that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax.
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents... your dinner.
Be our guest
Be our guest
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chérie and we provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff
It's delicious
Don't believe me
Ask the dishes
They can sing
They can dance
After all, miss this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest
Beef ragout, cheese soufflé
Pie and pudding en flambé
We'll prepare and serve with flair a culinary cabaret
You're alone and you're scared but the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes, I do tricks with my fellow candlesticks
Und it's all in perfect taste that you can bet
Come on and lift your glass

To be our guest if you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest
Be our guest, be our guest
Be our guest
Life is so unnerving for a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Get off!
Ah, those good old days when we were useful
- Huh?
- Suddenly those good old days are gone
- Oh!
- Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills
Most days wejust lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and upsy-daisy
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear, that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft- Shoein'
I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin'
I'll get warm, pipin'hot
Heaven sakes, is that a spot
Clean it up
We want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two
- For you, our guest
- She's our guest
- She's our guest

While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you
We'll keep going
Course by course
One by one

Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please be our
Guest
- Bravo! That was wonderful!
- Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now.
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.
- Oh, would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me. I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle.
Oh, well! Actually, I...
Yes, I do.
As you can see, the pseudo-facade was stripped away... to reveal the minimalist rococo design.
Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example of the late neoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say, if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the...
Uh, mademoiselle?
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what he's hiding up there.
- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would, uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to...
- Maybe later.
- Uh, the... the gardens... or, or the... the library perhaps?
You have a library?
- Yes! Oh, indeed.
- With books.
- Scads of books!
- Mountains of books!
- Forests of books!
- Cascades!
- Cloudbursts!
- Swamps of books!
More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever studied... by every author who ever set pen to paper.
By every author who ever set pen to paper.
Oh, oh.
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize what you could have done?
Please! Stop!
- Get out!
- No!
Get out!
- Where are you going?
- Promise or no promise...
I can't stay here another minute.
No, wait, please!
Please wait!
No!
Here, now. Don't do that.
Just hold still.
- That hurts!
- If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing!
Well, you should learn to control your temper!
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
By the way, thank you for saving my life.
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night... but he said you'd make it worth my while.
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle.
But she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat!
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is,
Belle would do anything... to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So you want me to throw her father into the asylum... unless she agrees to marry you.
Unless she agrees to marry you.
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!
If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone!
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...
I'll get her out of there.
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.
Guess it's not gonna work after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do, we'll be ready for them.
Lefou, don't move from that spot... until Belle and her father come home.
But... But I...
Ah, nuts!
I've never felt this way about anyone.
I want to do something for her, but what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.
Ah, no, no, it has to be something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!
Belle?
There's something
I want to show you.
But first, you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
- Can I open them?
- No, no. N-Not yet.
Wait here.
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now!
I can't believe it!
I've never seen so many books in all my life.
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful!
- Then it's yours.
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.
What? What works?
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.
There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought
That this could be
True
That he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see
- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul
- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who indeed
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own
- It's so peculiar, wait and see
- We'll wait a see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before
You know, perhaps there is something there that wasn't there before
What?
There may be something there that wasn't there before
- What's there, Mama?
- Shh.
I'll tell you when you're older.
Right, then, you all know why we're here.
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds... to create the most magical, spontaneous... romantic atmosphere known to man or beast.
Right. Need I remind you... that as the last petal falls from this rose... the spell will never be broken!
Very well. You all know your assignments.
Half of you to the west wing, half of you to the east wing... the rest of you, come with me.
Lighten up, Cogsworth, and let nature take its course.
It's obivious there's a spark between them.
Yes, but there's no harm in fanning the flames, you know... a little.
Besides, they must fall in love tonight if we ever expect to be human again.
- Ah, human again.
- Human again.
Yes, think what that means.
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again
Which should cause several husbands alarm
I'll hop down off this shelf and tout suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again
Be human again
Only human again
We'll be knick-knacks and what-nots no more
When we're human again
Good and human again
Oh, cherie, we'll be only top drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge and I won't be so huge
Why I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns
I'll have hair
It's my birth to be human again
When we're human again
Only human again
When the world once more starts making sense
I'll unwind for a change
Really that would be strange
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks
- And relax
- When I'm human again
So sweep fast round the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now
Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dustbin and broom
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now
Open the shutters and let in some air
Put these here and put those over there
Sweep up the years of sadness and tears
And throw them away
We'll be human again
Only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin'again
We're assumin'again
We'll assume our long lost joie de vivre
We'll be playin'again
Holidayin'again
And we're prayin'its'A.S.A.P.
We will push
We will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again
"There never was a story of more woe
"Than this of Juliet and her Romeo"
- Could you read it again?
- Here, why don't you read it to me?
Uh, all right.
- I can't.
- You mean, you never learned?
I learned... a little.
It's just been so long.
Well, here, I'll help you.
- Let's start here.
- Here.
- Okay. "Twoh..."
- "Two."
"Two." I knew that.
"Two households..."
We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding
As fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn when we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human
Again
Tonight is the night.
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold! Daring!
There will be music, romantic candlelight... provided by myself.
And when the moment is right, you confess your love.
Yes, I con...
I, I... No, I can't.
- You care for the girl, don't you?
- More than anything.
Well, then you must tell her.
Voila! Oh, you look so... so...
Stupid.
Not quite the word
I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.
Your lady awaits.
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Everjust the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Everjust as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Shh.
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love.
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see my father again just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way.
This mirror will show you anything... anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa! Oh, no!
He's sick. He may be dying, and he's all alone.
- Then you-you must go to him.
- What did you say?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean, I'm free?
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.
Take it with you so you'll always have a way... to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say... everything is going just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in you.
I let her go.
Yes, yes, splen...
You what?
How could you do that?
- I had to.
- Yes, but, but, but... but why?
Because I love her.
He did what?
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time, he's finally learned to love.
That's it then.
That should break the spell!
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
Papa? Papa?
They're back.
- Belle!
- Shh.
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
- I missed you so much!
- But the beast...
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
- Hi!
- Oh, a stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Y... Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us any more?
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
It's just that...
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was... I mean, he was... he was, uh, enormous!
I'd... I'd say at least eight, uh, no, more like ten feet!
Well, you don't get much crazier than that!
It's true, I tell you!
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!
No! You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding if...
- If what?
- If you marry me.
- What?
- One little word, Belle.
- That's all it takes.
- Never!
- Have it your way!
- Belle? Let go of me!
My father's not crazy and I can prove it!
Show me the beast.
- Is it dangerous?
- Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, I-I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle.
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better...
I'd think you had feelings for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are!
She's as crazy as the old man!
The beast will make off with your children.
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No!
We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall!
I say we kill the beast!
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me
Through the mist, through the woods through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there at the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead
Good and dead
- Kill the beast
- No, I won't let you do this.
If you're not with us, you're against us.
- Bring the old man!
- Get your hands off me!
We can't have them running off to warn the creature!
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!
- Who's with me?
- I am! I am!
- I am!
- Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist, to a wood where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest till he's good and deceased
Sally forth, tally-ho
Grab your sword and your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go
We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?
Now, now.
We'll think of something.
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the beast
I knew it. I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all.
- Could it be?
- Is it she?
Sacrebleu! Invaders!
- Encroachers!
- And they have the mirror!
Warn the master. If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them.
Who's with me?
Take whatever booty you can find.
But remember, the beast is mine!
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come 50 strong
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the beast
- Pardon me, Master.
- Leave me in peace.
But, sir, the castle is under attack!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
- This isn't working.
- Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!
Wait! I know!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
What shall we do, Master?
It doesn't matter now.
Just let them come.
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Now!
Yes!
Here we go!
What the devil?
Belle, look out!
You guys gotta try this thing.
Up here, you scurvy scum.
Now!
And stay out!
Get up!
What's the matter, beast?
Too kind and gentle to fight back?
No!
- Belle!
- No, Gaston, don't!
Let's go, Philippe.
Come on out and fight!
Were you in love with her, beast?
Did you honestly think she'd want you... when she had someone like me?
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything. Anything!
Get out!
- Beast!
- Belle.
Belle?
You came back.
You... You came back.
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...
Oh, this is all my fault.
If only I'd gotten here sooner.
Maybe it's better... it's better this way.
Don't talk like that.
You'll be all right.
We're together now. Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.
At least...
I got to see you one last time.
No! No!
Please! Please!
Please don't leave me.
I love you.
Belle, it's me!
It is you!
Lumiere!
Cogsworth!
Mrs Potts!
- Look at us!
- Mama! Mama!
- Oh, my goodness!
- It is a miracle!
Ah, I'amour.
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh, but I believe I told you.
No, you didn't. I told you!
You most certainly did not, you pompous, paraffin-headed peabrain!
En garde, you-you overgrown pocket watch!
- Take that!
- Stop shoving.
Are they gonna live happily ever after, Mama?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

You're not Miss Babe.
Uh, Babe's been taken ill.
I'm replacing her to do
Mrs. Stilton's nails.
OK?
All right, I guess so.
Hey.
Come here, Kiss. Come here.
Get out of here.
Come here, come here, Peaches.
Mrs. Stilton's upstairs in her room.
Oh, excuse me.
Yeah?
I have to look in your case.
What for?
Mr. Stilton says
I'm supposed to.
Thank you.
OK.
Can I go up now?
How long will you be?
Not long.
Will you need me to let you out?
No. I can do that by myself.
OK. Just be sure and close the big gates behind you.
Mrs. Stilton?
Yes. Come in. close the door.
What took so long?
I thought you were coming an hour ago.
You're not Babe.
Babe's sick, Mrs. Stilton.
Sick?
Yes. She asked me to pinch-hit.
Pinch-hit?
Do your manicure.
Well, I was expecting Babe.
She should have said something.
You can set up over there.
So did, uh...
Babe tell you to bring something for me?
What's your name?
Blondie.
Blondie?
Yeah, Blondie.
Didn't you ever read the funnies?
You're not a blonde, are you?
So what?
You asked me my name, and I told you.
Blond-ie.
Just asking.
Your husband's not home yet, huh?
No.
So, did Babe give you something to bring to me?
That's her stuff, right?
It's usually under the tray.
I know she was bringing me something.
Yeah, I got something for you.
Wh-wh-what? Here! Here!
Keep your rings on.
This ain't a robbery.
OK, OK, OK.
Take a couple of deep breaths.
Breathe! Try and get over the shock of this... so we can get down to business and cooperate with each other.
Now, where's your husband?
Gone.
Gone? Where?
When's he coming back?
Answer me!
Where's he at and when's he coming home, lady?
Hey!
Hey, you want your stuff?
You're not going to go yellow pants on me, are you?
Works fast, huh?
See you Friday.
Babe!
Can I see you for a second?
Her name is Pearl cummings.
She's a fourteen-year-old little colored girl.
I am Nettie Bolt of the
Junior League of Kansas City.
We were supposed to greet her here... about half an hour ago, and we were late.
I'd like to thank you all for coming today.
Why aren't you working?
Oh, I got three days.
I saved up.
Saved up?
Yeah. Nice.
Hey, you got two bucks
I could borrow?
Two dollars?
Yeah. Pay you back Friday.
Thanks, sis.
It's... It's for Johnny.
A surprise for my Johnny.
Listen to this shit.
"There was a lull today in organization activities...
"a brief pause before the actual battle...
"for control of the city begins.
"At dawn tomorrow, the final battle will begin."
That's what them faggots... on the "Kansas City
Journal Post" got to say.
Seldom Seen is telling you... that what's going to happen at dawn tomorrow... going to depend on what happen when the sun go down tonight.
You can believe that shit.
We will elect every Democrat on the ticket without exception!
So get out every vote for the Democratic candidates!
Vote early... in an orderly manner.
You can't sit there.
That's for white people.
I can't?
Not unless you want to get killed.
You coming in or going out?
In.
Who's supposed to meet you?
I don't know. Some white ladies.
White ladies. What for?
I been sent here to have a baby.
They're supposed to meet me.
You're pregnant?
You don't look it.
How old are you?
Fourteen.
All right, well, we're just going to have to go find her.
Ruth, you're consistently a half an hour late... and this time you've cost us a little colored girl.
Thank you very much.
Let's go!
Hi, honey.
Hey ya, Flynn!
It's Johnny... my Johnny.
Put it away... the money.
What are you doing out here?
Ain't you supposed to be working?
I am working.
Get back to it, then.
Wait for me, boys!
Charming little fella, your husband.
Thanks, Sis.
That's Stilton! That's Stilton!
Come on, get a picture of him.
Mr. Stilton, Jim Wilson,
"Kansas City Star."
Is it true that you and your wife are going to be... permanently relocating to Washington, D.C.?
I'm not relocating anywhere.
Rumor mill has it, sir...
Never listen to rumors, young man. Be responsible.
Rumor mill has it that since you've been... working so closely with the President... you're considering leaving.
Are you denying that?
Yes, I am.
Right now our own Henry Stilton... is on his way back to Washington to meet with the President.
Can I have an answer to that please, Mr. Stilton?
Mr. Stilton!
How about a comment... on the current political situation... here in Jackson County?
I have nothing at all to say to the press.
...and Kansas City is unanimously Democratic!
Washington?
What do you mean Washington?
Washington, D.c.?
What the hell's he doing there?
He travels there a lot.
That's where he works.
He's an adviser to President Roosevelt.
Are you lying to me?
No, I'm not lying.
It's what he does.
I know what he does.
Don't you think I know what he does?
Can I lie down now?
Yeah. You're going to tell me... where he stays when he's there, all that.
Don't stall around with me.
I'm in a desperate situation here.
I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
So don't mess with me
'cause I'm running out of time.
I'd just as soon shoot you... and those two Kraut dogs down there along with it.
Now spit it out.
What time is Sheepshan's train coming in?
Should be here by now.
Who'd you send to pick up Sheepshan Red?
Blue Green.
He's been waiting around for the call all morning.
Blue Green?
Yes.
He's the worst driver in the place.
What are you waiting for? A tip?
Sheepshan squeeze a dollar till the eagle shit.
He ain't giving up nothing.
Call me when he come in.
OK.
How're the dice, brother?
Forty on five.
Hey, boys, get on that truck!
Let's go! Load 'em up!
Say, Blue, if you're going back to the cab company... we sure would like to have a ride with you... if you don't have a fare.
Get out of here, Parker. Go.
Let's go! Get them up there!
All right, go.
Sir! Sir!
Sir! We got a cab waiting for you right here.
I'm going to the Street's Hotel.
Yes, sir.
You're Sheepshan Red, ain't you?
That's what they call me.
What train's he on?
The Grand Canyon Limited to chicago... then the Capitol Limited to Washington.
So right now he's on a train to Chicago... not Washington, right?
You're some liar, lady.
I'm not lying.
To get to Washington... he's got to go through
Chicago and change trains.
All right. What time does he get in Chicago?
Ten of 3:00. I don't know.
Thanks.
You know, my husband will pay the money.
You don't have to worry about that.
What money?
This isn't about money.
I don't want your money.
Then what is it about?
What this is about is Johnny O'Hara.
I just want to get him back, safe.
If Henry doesn't help me,
I'm going to kill you.
I got nothing against you.
Anyhow, that's my plan.
Think he'll go for it?
Who's Johnny O'Hara?
Give me the money!
What? What?
Come on!
Just do what he says, mister, so no one gets hurt.
Come on, yellow pants.
I know you're wearing it.
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
Did you see his face?
Who is that?
Goddamn it!
Take me to the Hey-Hey Club.
Yes, sir.
Seldom's going to hear about this shit!
Yes, sir.
That's Lester Young... over there.
Here we are, sir.
Your hat.
Come on, driver.
You're coming with me.
I have another call.
Another call, my ass!
I'm your next call!
You are my witness, and you're coming with me.
I'm trying to tell you... somebody took all my goddamn money!
Stuck a gun in my face... and took my money belt right off my waist!
But you just came in on the train.
I came in on a cab from the train, Seldom.
Seldom, your coat.
- What?
- Your coat.
I don't want no goddamn coat.
Somebody set me up, Seldom!
Some nigger was waiting on me.
You know goddamn well...
I ain't gonna stand for this shit.
What are you telling me?
Some nigger robbed me in your cab!
Stuck a gun in my face and took all my damn money!
That's what I'm talking about!
In my cab?
In your fucking cab, Seldom.
Blue Green! Blue!
Where's Blue?
That nigger knew what he was doing.
He was waiting for me.
Come here, Blue.
What the hell are you hiding back there for?
Come out here, boy.
What happened here?
I don't know nothing about it.
Some man hopped in the cab and started waving his gun around.
Colored man?
Yes, Seldom.
You recognize him?
No, Seldom.
Sheepshan, this don't make no sense.
Nobody around here would pull that kind of shit.
Nobody around here that dumb.
We'll take care of you.
We'll find out.
We'll get...
Goddamn, what's this shit?
What the hell is that?
It's on you.
What does it look like?
Smell like lampblack, smell it.
I don't know nothing about that.
You were there!
What the hell you mean... you don't know nothing about it?
I don't know nothing about it.
Don't know nothing about what, Blue?
Don't know nothing about nothing, Seldom.
Smells like burnt cork.
Smell that.
What that smell like?
You holding out on me, boy?
Jesus Christ... you've been held up by Amos 'n' Andy.
Can you believe that shit?
Amos 'n' Andy.
Right, Amos?
Right?
I don't know nothing about it.
Tell me about this, boy!
What happened?
Whose idea was it?
Don't fuck with me!
Whose idea was it?
So long, Amos.
Come on, man! Come on, man!
Let's go! Get your coat!
OK, I'm coming.
Hurry up, boy.
Johnny?
Hey.
Hurry up. Get your clothes on.
I am hurrying.
We're going to take a powder.
A what?
We're going out for a while.
Oh, uh, we are?
Uh, what should I wear?
Whatever you wear when you go out to shop or something.
Nothing fancy.
Yeah, don't try to high-hat me.
I got your number, sister.
What's that stuff you take?
Nerve medicine.
Laudanum.
Yeah? What's it do?
It relaxes me.
It's a tonic for my nerves.
No kidding.
Maybe I ought to try some.
Think it will help my nerves?
Jackass!
Do you want some?
Babe says it's dope.
She says you're a dopehead.
Babe is a regular magpie, isn't she?
Who's Johnny?
'Cause you haven't told me anything really.
You don't listen very well, lady.
I listen well enough.
Babe your sister?
Where was Babe tonight?
Did she know about this?
Why don't you shut up?
He didn't mean any harm, though.
He's just thinking of me... just dreaming.
Why don't you have a drink, doll?
No, thank you.
Come on.
Good American brandy.
Have a drink.
All right.
Thank you.
Mister, my husband did a dumb thing.
You got your money back, right?
Right?
I got the money. All of it.
Sucker didn't even buy himself a pack of cigarettes.
Good.
So, uh, can I have my husband back now?
How would you like him?
In a sack or in a box?
Son of a bitch, don't you touch him!
I'll kill you!
Now what are they doing to her?
Let me go!
Stop it! Stop!
Out.
Where are we going?
Out. Don't make me say it a third time.
On a train?
Out of town?
Shut up.
All right.
Easy.
Can you walk?
Of course I can walk.
Then do it.
I'm holding on to you.
No, I'm holding you.
Just walk like a lady, for Christ's sake.
Don't do anything funny, understand?
Funny word, isn't it?
It's funny.
Just 'cause we're in a public place... doesn't mean I won't use this gun if I have to.
No, that wouldn't be funny, would it?
Stop all that funny business.
Carry your own weight.
I'm not so big.
Oh, hey, Addie.
Hi, Miss Blondie.
We're just going to go into
Mr. Hoyt's office for a while.
That OK with you?
I haven't finished in there yet.
Park the body, sister.
Take your coat off.
We're going to be here awhile.
You're very bold, aren't you?
Just do like I said.
Union Station. May I help you?
Yeah, I need to know... if someone's on the Grand canyon
Limited to Chicago... that left Kansas city today at... What time?
Red?
4:15. Where the train is now... and if I tell him to get off the train at the next stop... where would that be?
Is this an emergency, ma'am?
Yeah, it sure is.
The train is due into
Fort Madison, Iowa, at 9:30.
So soonest I could talk to him would be 9:30?
That's when the train stops.
All right, thanks.
All right, you stay glued to that seat.
And don't get silly
'cause I've got someone... right outside that door who'll bop you.
Is that clear?
Yes, it's very clear.
Need your help here, Addie.
This lady, she's run off from her husband.
He's been beating her up and whatnot... and I'm trying to help her... but I got to go send a telegram right now... so I need you to watch her.
Watch her?
Yeah, keep an eye peeled.
I don't want her going anyplace.
Think you're a smart Jane, don't you?
I don't know about all this, Miss Blondie.
I'll give you the straight goods.
She's on dope.
You know what that means.
Yes, ma'am, I do.
Ah, she's bumping into walls... and talking the screwiest stories.
If she tries to go someplace, just tell her she can't.
Wouldn't want her to hurt herself, now, would we?
No, ma'am.
What's your name for him?
Who?
What do you call him?
Henry, Hank, what?
Mr. Stilton?
I... I don't know.
I call him that.
When you're alone, nitwit.
What do you call him in private?
Your pet name for him.
Private? Uh, I don't know what you mean.
In bed, when you're doing it.
You do do it, don't you?
Heinie.
Sometimes I call him Heinie.
What's he call you?
What name do you use with him?
What's he call you?
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
In private.
Pussy.
Pussy?
Pussy and Heinie.
What a terrible invasion of privacy.
Yeah, ain't it?
How's your son doing?
Charles? Oh, Charles is fine, Miss Blondie.
He's good. He plays in the high-school marching band.
Yeah? Good for you.
Look. That's Lester Young right there on the saxophone.
See that man there?
Uh-huh.
That's Seldom Seen.
Seldom Seen?
What kind of name is that?
He won't tell nobody what his real name is.
He's a gambler... and he goes around to all kinds of different places.
Might not see him for a long time.
He's been to prison three times for murder.
He's a big talker, though...
Seldom Seen but often heard.
Oh, hi, Blondie.
Oh, hey, Lucy.
Hey, Alice, you can take your break now.
I didn't know it was your shift, Blondie.
Yeah, old battle-ax changed my hours again.
Your hair's growing out good, huh?
Yeah. Every day.
You're not Rose.
No, ma'am. I'm Addie Parker.
Where's Rose?
You mean Miss Blondie, ma'am?
Yes. Yes, I mean Blondie.
Where is Blondie?
She's in the operating room, ma'am.
Operating room?
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, so is...
Is this the hospital?
No. It's the Western Union where you send the wires.
Wires?
Telegrams.
My husband. Yes.
We're going to contact my husband.
Oh, I don't know anything about all that, ma'am.
Well, I-I don't think she would like it... if she thought we were being too talkative.
My husband is doing all the talking... but he is no longer part... of the local political establishment, per Se.
He hasn't been since 1932... when President Roosevelt appointed him adviser.
And regardless of the outcome of the local election... my husband will stay in Washington.
Yes, ma'am.
As to the situation here...
I don't know if he really cares... whether the Goats are good or the Rabbits are wrong.
I mean, he's sympathetic to the Rabbits... but that has nothing to do with my situation here tonight.
Our situation, I should say.
Which do you prefer?
Well, I think you're a mighty pretty lady, ma'am... and either one of these hats will do you just fine.
Goats or Rabbits.
Oh, I don't know much about Goats and Rabbits, ma'am.
Oh, you don't?
No, ma'am.
Miss.
Oh, hi.
Can you help me?
I need to send a telegram.
I'm in a hurry... but I've got to reach this girl's mother tonight.
This one is for...
Well, Blondie, hello.
What happened to your hair?
It broke off.
Too much peroxide.
OK. It's pretty.
It's different.
OK. Shoot.
All right. This one is for Mrs. Pearl cummings.
I'm sorry.
Pearl is the daughter.
That's for Mrs. Cummings.
And that's very important.
That's got to go right away.
And then this is for Governor Park.
And then we have
President Roosevelt.
We've got an emergency here... and we're asking them to call out the National Guard for us.
I thought we could talk this over like gentlemen.
Take your coat off.
All here?
It's all there, Seldom.
Sit down.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on! Come on!
Goddamn it! Shit!
Merry Christmas, Sheepshan.
Nice to see old friends.
Thank you.
What's going on here?
Nothing, Miss Blondie.
Come on. We're through here.
Give me that.
I paid five dollars for this hat.
My, what a bargain.
Come on.
Thanks a million, Addie.
You're welcome, Miss Blondie.
You don't need to crack about any of this.
Be better if you didn't.
Nobody's going to ask me anything.
They never do.
I got to say this for you.
You got guts.
Guts and no brains.
Guts alone don't mean nothing.
Guts is cheap.
Fucking pig got guts.
Blue, here, he's sitting up all night long... sucking on some pig guts.
Don't even know which you like better... pot of chitlings or a piece of pussy.
A pig got more brains than you.
You come swinging in here like... like Tarzan... right in the middle of a sea of niggers... like you're in a picture show.
You like picture shows?
I'm talking to you.
You like picture shows?
I can take them or leave them.
I'd recommend you leave them... after what they done done to your ass... with all that Ham-bone and Stepin Fetchit shit.
Or maybe...
Maybe you're a radio man.
You... you like radio?
Answer me!
Yeah, I like it sometimes.
Goddamn right you do.
All that Amos... Amos 'n' Andy.
In the movies and in radio... white people just sit around all day long... thinking up that shit.
And then they believe it.
Hello, Ruby.
Hello, Eddie.
Did you miss me?
I've been dying for you.
Gee, and I thought...
I know what you thought, and I don't blame you.
I didn't dare to try to get word to you.
All I wanted to do was to get away.
Soon as I could send for you...
Sure. I know.
I got some great plans for the two of us... and the kid... our kid.
Central operator.
Hello, central.
I'd like to place a call to Kansas City, Missouri.
I made my mind up that today we were going to be married.
Gee, those are the breaks.
Everything's going to be all right.
I'm going to have you... and you're going to have me for always.
Gee, it feels good, holding you like this.
I love you, Eddie.
You still with us?
Long distance.
Fort Madison, Iowa, train station... and put some snap into it.
What do you mean she's gone?
What's happening?
What's going on?
She's just gone with the lady who came to do her nails.
Babe?
No, sir. It wasn't Miss Babe.
You better have yourself... another little swig of that stuff.
You're going to get to talk to Heinie in a minute.
You better not call him that.
He won't like that one bit.
I did everything I was supposed to do, Mr. Stilton.
I'm not in any trouble, am I?
Mr. Stilton?
Yes.
There's a call for you.
It's long distance from Kansas City.
It's your wife.
All right, Rose, Mrs. Stilton's on another line here.
Now you stay awake.
Have yourself a cup of coffee... and stay by my phone in case I need you.
Yes, sir.
Carolyn, what's going on?
I'm not Carolyn, Mr. Stilton.
Who is this?
Easy, tough guy.
I'm in charge here, OK?
Is this about the emergency?
I just tried to call home.
Is my wife all right?
Is she awake?
Yeah. I'm here with your wife.
Then let me speak to her, please.
In a minute you can talk to her.
First you're going to listen to me.
What is this? Who are you?
You got a pencil?
Take this down.
There's a guy named Johnny O'Hara, OK?
He's been picked up by some nigger gangsters.
The head guy's named Seldom Seen.
You'll find him at the Hey-Hey club on 18th street.
Wait a minute.
On 18th street.
They're going to knock
Johnny off unless you stop it.
I figure any guy that can tell... old Bandy Legs where to get off... can get these no-good shines to let my Johnny go.
I'm keeping your wife for insurance, get it?
If Johnny gets free, you get your wife back.
If he doesn't, I'm going to put a bullet through her head.
And don't get cute, smart guy.
Play games, they're both dead...
Johnny and your wife.
You follow me?
Yes.
Good.
OK. Where's the club?
Uh... 18th street.
The Hey-Hey Club.
Good.
I'm going to put her on the phone now... so you can hear her voice.
Then I want you to go to work for Johnny.
If anything goes wrong,
Mr. Stilton, she's a goner.
H-H-Heinie.
Carolyn, are you all right?
Yes. Yes. I'm OK.
I'm calm, uh, as much as I can be.
Oh...
She's desperate, as you can tell.
I'm cooperating.
Are you sure you're all right?
I'll get through this.
That's enough, Pussy.
You're eating into his time.
No. No.
I haven't taken anything.
All right, Mr. Stilton.
Do what you got to do.
Get on the phone to Lazia or Pendergast... or whoever else you know.
I figure you're on the next train out of there.
I'll phone you at your house when you get back.
You better have the right answers by then.
Your beautiful wife won't look so great... with her brains splattered all over the sidewalk.
Looks like I'm going to have you on my hands for a while.
Think you can stand the company?
I left my baby
Standing in the back door crying
Yes, I left my baby
Standing in the back door crying
Well, she said,
"Baby, as long as I got a home"
"You know you can come to mine"
When I leave you, baby, count the days that I'm gone
Got him around here somewheres.
He's in one of these rats' nests.
You can bet on it.
You can count the days that I'm gone
You know, I don't really know what you're talking about... so it's hard for me to follow you.
Who asked you to?
Nobody did.
Well, then, shut up.
Greed just grabbed your ass... and fucked up your think machine.
White people are consumed with greed.
Just can't get enough.
Never get enough of anything.
Even they don't need it, they got to have it... and don't care how they get it.
You lie, you cheat, you hustle, you rape.
You kill your mothers.
You burn your babies.
You piss in the soup.
This here depression is because y'all can't get enough.
Goddamn bus ain't got no driver.
Roosevelt up there in Washington... sitting down in his wheelchair... trying to put poor-ass crackers on Home Relief.
And Marcus Garvey trying to put niggers... on boats to go back to Africa up there in New York.
What the fuck are you going to do in Africa?
Huh?
You must be in some sad shit... to have to be holding up colored people.
What am I going to do with you?
I'll think of something.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, bet you he's in the basement... or some back room or something.
What is that place?
I'm not talking to you, half-wit.
Well, who are you talking to?
Myself.
Well, so how am I supposed to know?
There are two of us here, you know.
I mean, when one person is talking... it's reasonable to assume that the party who is speaking... is speaking to the other party, isn't it?
Now listen to me, operator.
This is really quite simple.
Let's not make a big production out of this.
I want the Governor's Mansion in Jefferson City, Missouri.
I want to speak to Governor Guy Park... and it's an emergency.
Just one call.
I'll be right back.
Henry, what can I do for you?
Guy, I need your help.
My wife's been kidnapped.
A woman came to the house and took her... when I was on the train.
The woman says she wants her husband back.
Some of the colored have him.
Where are you?
Where did this happen, in Kansas city?
I should get the state police in on this.
No, no, no, no.
We can't have any police.
Il don't want the publicity... you understand?
I don't want this story getting back to Washington... where it can cause some real damage.
It has to be handled very quietly and quickly.
Kansas City.
Tomorrow's Election Day.
This is a tough call.
Everybody's going to be distracted.
Well, what about John Lazia?
Can you contact him?
Yes. He's the one... Lazia.
I can't talk to him directly.
I have to go through Pendergast, I guess.
I don't like asking favors.
It will cost me down the line.
Look, Guy,
I'll make this up to you.
President Roosevelt...
I know. I know.
You don't have to promise anything.
Your wife's in danger.
Get her back.
That's the important thing.
Bess. That's her name, isn't it?
Carolyn.
Oh, yes, of course.
Bess is Truman's wife.
Look, Guy,
I appreciate this. Thanks.
Excuse me.
What time does the train... back to Kansas city come through here?
What did you think of her?
I'm sorry.
Are you addressing me?
Yeah, I'm addressing you.
What did you think of her?
Who?
Harlow.
I thought her hair looked cheap.
Cheap! Ha! That's a laugh.
Joan crawford looks cheap, not Jean Harlow.
Joan who?
Crawford.
"Grand Hotel"?
Jesus Christ.
What do you do all day?
Well, I don't frequent movie theaters... unlike some I could mention.
I don't know about all that stuff.
Let me tell you something.
Harlow, Crawford, two of MGM's brightest.
Crawford comes from here.
Both her and Jean Harlow come from Kansas City.
I know where the house is
Jean Harlow grew up in.
She ain't cheap.
Her daddy's a dentist.
Dr. carpenter.
Still lives here.
Wait. Wait. Which?
Dentist? Doctor?
Carpenter? Which?
Ah, useless!
It's like talking to a fish.
Well, don't confuse me.
Watch your ash.
I mean, you asked me what I thought... and I'm telling you.
Her hair looked cheap and brassy and common to me.
Low-class, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.
Are you trying to tell me that hair of yours... don't come out of a bottle... just like your cheeks and your lips and your nails... and anything else you can paint on?
Cheap.
If Jean Harlow's cheap, then I'm a monkey's uncle.
What am I doing, yapping away with some idiot?
Sitting here like two hanging ducks.
She ain't cheap.
I'm not talking to you anymore.
Great. Great.
Maybe I have the upper hand then.
We're out of gas.
I concede the merry chase.
Maybe you're insane.
You have no husband.
You are dying, and I'm dying.
Will you shut up?
I can't think with you talking like a nutcase!
OK, toots. Out.
No, you can't stop what's already been decided.
Something, whatever we discover it to be... has already been decided.
We're just going along for the ride... until at the latter day... we reach the house of a thousand candles.
Yeah. Northside Democratic Club.
John Lazia, please.
Tom Pendergast calling.
Just a minute.
John, Tom Pendergast on the phone for you.
Tom Pendergast?
A little late for him, isn't it?
He goes to bed with the chickens.
Mr. Pendergast, John Lazia here.
Yeah, John.
Sorry to call so late.
It's not late.
What can I do for you?
Listen, John, I got a call from Governor Park.
Henry Stilton needs a favor.
It seems his wife has gone and got herself kidnapped... and he's somewhere in Iowa.
She got kidnapped in Iowa?
No, she didn't get kidnapped in Iowa.
She got kidnapped right here in Kansas City.
This could turn out to be a good thing for us.
You ever had to use a gun before?
Huh?
Have you ever shot a bullet through someone's body... like you talk about?
I bet I'd be better at doing that than you would.
Give it a rest, will you?
Take another swig of that stuff if you have to... but don't talk anymore.
I've been annoyed with your kisser long enough.
Out of gas, huh?
Yeah. A few blocks up.
Don't have a gas can, either, huh?
Don't have a can.
Excuse me, young man.
Would there be a rest room around here?
Right around the corner.
Thank you.
You only get two gallons.
There's a ten-cent deposit on this can, too, you know.
What do you think you're trying to pull?
Leave the door open.
Tommy guns. You hear that?
Coming this way.
Don't! Don't! Don't!
OK, OK. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot. I give up!
Let's go.
Come on.
Hey, you didn't pay for that gas, did you?
Here's your drink, sir.
I don't want that.
I didn't order that.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Here's your drink, sir.
Thank you very much.
Where are we going?
Well, we ain't goin' very far on two gallons of gas, are we?
I never thought of that.
What?
Oh, gas... and how long it lasts.
Hey, nothing runs on nothing.
Whatever you do, you're using something up.
Even time.
Light me, will you?
You know, when you said that stuff... about her being cheap...
Harlow... that was just a part she was playing.
She's an actress, you know.
I seen that picture six times.
And I read in "Photoplay" she's making a new one.
It's called
"Girl from Missouri."
I can't wait to see that one.
I'm from Missouri, too.
People say I look like her... when my hair's blond.
Weren't we just here?
We got to spend the night somewhere.
I figure it's pretty safe.
No one would figure we'd come back here.
All the cops are going to be out... stuffing ballot boxes.
Well, what do you mean "safe"?
I mean, you know, people get killed here.
Didn't you read about
The Union Station Massacre?
It just happened last year.
I was working here, wasn't I?
Really?
Do you know that Frank Nash's toupee... got blown right off his head?
No more bets.
All right.
You have to understand Sheepshan.
He's a loser.
Losers have got to be respected.
They're the backbone of my business.
They're my customers... and I take good care of my customers.
Spent all year waiting to come to this crap game... up there in Minnesota... putting these big wooden dicks into holes all over the ground... telephone poles... just to be in this game.
He's the only colored man
I know... got a contract with the phone company, ain't he?
That's right.
Son, nigger's supposed to be respected.
May I ask you something?
I'm not through talking.
Sheepshan's an evil son of a bitch.
If he loses, he'll see bad luck written all over you... and he's going to want to cut you up.
And if he wins,
I'm coming for you.
Then you're going to wish he done the cutting.
Either way, you're going to hook up with Blue here... wherever you're going.
You and him can work on your Amos 'n' Andy routine.
Yes, sir.
If somebody doped Trixie... they would have had to climb up the ladder... through the window, and what would happen?
He would have barked.
It was somebody inside the Lindbergh house.
So you subscribe to the theory that Violet Sharpe was involved?
Listen, nobody socks down cyanide unless they're guilty.
I'll tell you something.
If this is the case, then those Lindberghs... should have gotten themselves a colored maid... and this might never have happened.
Those Lindberghs were too snooty.
They had to get English help.
- Scottish. Scottish.
- Whatever.
Sure are a beautiful couple.
Gosh, that baby was cute.
Perfect.
Beautiful couple, beautiful baby.
He was only three years old.
He weren't three.
Weren't even two.
He was eighteen months old when they found him.
I cried every time I saw his picture in the paper.
You got kids?
No.
Me, either.
I got it.
Whoa!
Help us now!
Pockets.
Seldom!
You got too many goddamn pockets... somebody gonna want to pick them.
That's why I got a box.
I'm sorry, Seldom!
Only one man ever been in my box... Marcus Garvey.
Garvey said to me... he said, "Seldom, I want to buy me some boats...
"and I want to take all the black people...
"in America back to Africa.
"I want you to invest in my Black Star Line...
"make you a lot of money."
Did I ever tell you the story about Marcus Garvey... the Jew, and the white man?
No.
They were shipwrecked on this island... and one day they was walking along the beach... and they find themselves this whiskey bottle.
They start to brush the sand off the bottle... and out come this genie, and the genie says...
"I've been here for 4,000 years...
"and I want to thank y'all for letting me out.
"Anything you want. One wish."
So they turn to Garvey, and Garvey said...
"Well, I would like all the black people in the world...
"to go back to Africa and live forever."
Then he turned to the Jew... and he said to him,
"What do you want?"
And the Jew says,
"Well, I'd like to have...
"all the Jews in the world
"go back to the Holy Land and live forever."
Then he turned to the cracker... and he said to him,
"What you want?"
The cracker said,
"Wait a minute.
"You mean you got...
"all the niggers in the world in Africa...
"and you got all the kikes in the world... in the Holy Land?"
The genie said, "Yeah."
He said, "Well, then, shit.
"Give me a martini."
Anybody want some pork?
Goddamn.
Come on, boys.
Let's hear some music.
Bye, Blue.
Come on. We got to get home before my mother does... or she's going to go to prison for murdering me.
Am I going with you?
Where else you going to go?
Come on.
All right. Wake up.
Wake up.
Up.
Now, what...
What are you doing here?
It's me... Blondie.
Yeah. I know you.
Yeah. Come on. We got to get.
Is my husband here?
No, but he's coming.
He's going to be here any minute... so we got to get out of sight.
Wouldn't want him to think we came down... to meet him, would we?
We wouldn't?
No, we wouldn't.
Oh! Dreams.
You snore in your sleep.
You ladies certainly had to get here early this morning... to be first in line.
Yes, we did.
But you know, the early bird gets the worm.
That's what I've always said.
I hear that.
So you think your vote's... going to make a difference then, I take it.
Well, of course, it will.
We're here early to cast our vote... before Mr. Pendergast this morning.
Mr. Pendergast!
Not today, fellas.
I'm just here to vote.
Well, here we go.
Thank you.
Is it true that you're backing Harry Truman...
One question.
I'm sorry.
Just take them up.
I'm here... I mean,
Stilton residence. Thank you.
Rose, this is Mr. Stilton.
Let me speak with Mrs. Stilton.
She ain't back yet, Mr. Stilton.
Rose.
Rose. Stop crying, Rose.
It's not your fault.
Just stay there.
I'll be home soon.
You ever meet Babe's old man?
No.
That's his bar.
All right, boys, listen up!
Voting time.
I want you in two single lines.
Right now. Come on.
Line up. Line up.
Put the drinks down and line up.
He's got a lot of customers.
Those aren't customers.
Those are voters.
They ship them in from all over the state.
Each one of them vote ten, twelve times.
They used to get their names out of the cemetery.
I don't even think they bother anymore.
You'll be exercising your God-given right to vote.
However, you'll be voting the way I tell you to vote... and as many times as I tell you.
Is that understood?
Yeah.
Understood?
Shut up!
Democrats do that?
Democrats?
They're whatever they're paid to be.
This is America, lady.
Right face! come on.
Is that the best you can do?
Left face!
You boys are a bunch of sorry asses... but I'll get you in shape.
I don't want to do this shit anymore.
I want a drink.
Go home.
Duck. That's him. Duck.
You understand now?
What are you looking at?
Get this car out of here!
Blondie, is that you?
What the hell are you doing?
Who's this with you?
That?
That's my friend Red.
She's visiting me from Joplin.
Hey, where's Babe? She here?
That boyfriend of yours is in big trouble.
He's not my boyfriend.
Word's out.
He's my husband!
What did you hear?
He's in big trouble's what I hear.
Son of a bitch got what he deserved... and don't go dragging Babe into it.
Babe's already in it up to here.
Goddamn you, Blondie.
We're coming in, Flynn.
We'll just camp out upstairs till the polls open.
We won't bother nobody. Out.
You better not.
I'm getting fed up with your crap.
Go bust a few more noses.
All right, shut up!
Go ahead.
Line up on the right.
Let's go.
Get out the door now!
Go! Move it!
Hey, you, what are you, special?
Go!
Hey, Flynn.
- Flynn!
- What?
Give me a couple of corned beefs on rye and two beers.
A Coca-cola.
Yeah, and a Coca-cola.
I look like your nigger?
Tell the waitress.
I'm calling Babe.
If you think you're fooling me... with your friend from Joplin stuff...
I know what's what.
Eh! You got all the answers, don't you?
I used to work here.
You drive a cab, boy?
Good.
We got an opening.
I just lost one of my drivers.
Hi, Glenn Dora.
My mama home yet?
Lucky for you she's not.
Bringing young girls into her house.
Hiya, Sis.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Maybe you'll get your nails done after all.
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?
You're going to bring it down on all of us... and I'm the goat here.
I'm the one who's going to get it.
Mrs. Stilton,
I'm sorry about this.
If you just get your things together...
I'm going to take you home now.
But we just got here.
What are you trying to do, be a hero?
I don't believe this.
I don't believe it.
Believe it.
You've got a gun?
You're pointing a gun at me?
At your own sister?
Oh, shut up and sit down.
It's not about you.
It's about Johnny... my Johnny.
That's all it's about.
Mrs. Stilton,
I'm real sorry about this.
I didn't know this was going to happen.
I didn't know my sister was crazy.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?
If I did, what would you have done... called Pendergast or Lazia?
You think they'd go work for me?
Why didn't you come to Johnny? My Johnny?
What's he going to do?
He's got connections.
So's she.
You told me you were going to have her make a phone call.
I didn't have much choice, did I?
Seldom Seen and those niggers mean business.
They're going to kill my husband.
We don't use that word in our household.
We say colored.
Jesus Christ.
Blondie, you are plain nuts.
You kidnapped her.
I want my husband back.
That's all I'm thinking about.
And you've ruined me.
You might even have ruined my Johnny.
He's got nothing to do with your Johnny... robbing some niggers.
Excuse me, Mrs. Stilton.
What do you know about it?
They came after me, Blondie.
They thought I did it... or at least they think
I was in on it with you.
So? She'll tell them you had nothing to do with it.
Won't you, lady?
What I find fascinating is that both you ladies... are married to men named Johnny.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Blondie.
You've gone too far.
You got me mixed up in this.
You got my husband mixed up.
Your Johnny knew what would happen.
He knew what would happen if he got caught... and, Blondie, they're not going to let him go!
Yeah!
No! Not like you think.
You got to give this up... and you got to let her go, too... because they're going to kill you!
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.
You shot that gun!
You shot that gun!
Get up, lady.
We're getting out of here.
You son of a gun.
Thanks for the help, Sis.
Thanks a fucking lot.
Pull in right here, Jim.
Where'd they get these guys?
All right, boys.
Fall in.
Line up.
Johnny?
All right. All right.
All right.
Don't forget to vote Democrat, gentlemen.
Let's go.
Be a good Democrat today.
They stink. Stink.
What's going on here?
You just step back.
I'll take care of this.
You guys get out of this line... that don't live in this precinct.
We're not going to have any of this going on.
Nobody votes at this poll that don't live here.
I got a big problem.
These guys don't live in my precinct.
They're not going to vote here.
They're gonna get out of here.
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
Just shut up!
Let's go!
Get back in line.
Feels like I'm getting a cold.
All this running around.
You'd better be careful.
You'll be next.
A cold's the least of my worries.
Got to find a phone.
Got to talk to Heinie.
Heinie's in Washington.
He's with
President Roosevelt.
You got a short memory, don't you?
Oh, that's right.
We talked to him, didn't we?
Yeah. Dig deep in there,
Einstein... and give me your home number.
My... Oh, ah...
Yeah, it's 4-7... No. It's...
Never mind!
I'll call the operator.
All right!
There's some gentlemen here to see you...
Shut the door, Rose.
Who are you, and what are you doing in my house?
I'm Charlie Gargotta.
Hi, Mr. Stilton.
I'm Jackie ciro.
Yes, I know who you are.
My God, man.
You can't come to my house in broad daylight.
You think people don't watch what I do?
You've no business being here.
Get dressed, Rose.
Anything we have to talk about... we can talk about on the phone.
Did anyone see you come here?
John Lazia sent us, Mr. Stilton.
We're here to help you get your wife back.
Northside Democratic.
John Lazia, please.
I'm calling for Henry Stilton.
John.
Hello. This is John Lazia.
John, this is Henry Stilton.
My God, man.
Why would you send these people to my house, for Christ's sake?
This was Pendergast's call.
Can't this be handled on the telephone?
Pendergast asked me to help out with it.
I don't think you understand... the consequences of this kind of thing.
T-o-n. On Fifty-sixth.
Henry.
Mrs. Parker.
Addie.
Fine turnout.
I'm sorry. That line is busy.
Hey, Addie.
Oh, hi, Miss Blondie.
What are you doing out here?
Voting.
I just got through voting.
There's a lot of folks... down at the Western Union been looking for you.
Yeah, I bet there was.
What did you tell them?
Nothing because nobody didn't ask me nothing... but they were asking everybody else.
About what?
About where you was and about that Mrs. Stilton.
You live around here?
Yes, ma'am.
Over on Olive Street.
You got a telephone?
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.
Come on, Addie, I'm going to give you a ride home.
I don't want to be no bother.
It's not far, and I can walk.
It's no bother.
Besides, I'd like to use your phone if I could.
Anyhow, get in.
Thank you.
Kind of tight in here.
You know why Blue's gone and you're still here?
Because I want you here.
I'm not sure I got everything... out of your ass
I'm going to get.
I know how you-all do business.
I know everything there is to know about you ofays.
Your woman come running in here screaming...
"Can I have my husband back?"
"You got your money!"
Sheepshan got the money.
That put a smile on his face.
That is, unless he loses.
What about me?
Who's going to take care of my business... my reputation, my name?
Pearl, come here.
Hey, how long you live here, Addie?
Nice neighborhood.
Hey, that's the lady from the club, ain't it?
Which lady?
That one. The one that was kicking and screaming.
They had to take her out.
You sure?
Well, I think so.
You better keep it to yourself.
One of Lazia's men was on his way... to the Hey-Hey club last night, but he never made it.
He got in a shoot-out with Sheriff Bash.
I know about that. I saw it.
You saw it?
Never mind. Keep going.
That's what happened.
A terrible coincidence.
So now some other fellas are getting your husband back... so it shouldn't take long.
Johnny's OK?
Yes, he's fine.
Because if he's not
OK and you know it... you're wasting your time.
Don't you tell nobody about what happened here.
Can I have some money?
What for?
School.
Everything all right?
You don't look so good.
You did the right thing bringing her here, Charles.
Now, you be on your way.
Addie.
Yeah?
Do you think we could rest here for an hour or two?
We didn't get much sleep last night.
Well, it just seem like nobody did.
If my mother was alive, she'd cut your balls off.
Woman went right to the point.
She never, ever missed a beat, but, of course... maybe you haven't been treated as badly as she was treated... for so long.
Tell me.
You ever been treated bad at all in your whole life ever?
Then how would you know what it's like to feel good?
Right now you should be feeling good, and you don't.
Listen to that music.
That's Bill Basie.
He's part of the reason you ain't dead yet.
You know they give the death penalty... now for kidnapping?
Jesus Christ.
What are you trying to do, give me nightmares?
My husband would never put me in the position... your husband put you in.
Shut up.
Everybody makes mistakes.
You'd do the same thing for Heinie.
Ain't that right?
No, I don't think so.
You don't know nothing about love.
What do you mean?
Yeah, love. Real love.
The kind that makes somebody else a part of you... a part of your body.
It's like he's part of my insides.
You know what
I'm talking about.
Right?
Get me?
I think we should try and sleep now.
If it's real love, then you're both the same person... so nothing one can do could ever hurt the other person...
'cause... it's yourself.
Good night.
Like breathing.
I lost my train of thought.
I ain't scared of death.
I deal with his ass every day.
He come knocking at my door, asking me about people...
'cause he knows
I know everything... there is to know about what's going on.
He's a cold cocksucker.
One of these days... one of those knocks are going to be for me... but so what?
Sooner or later, everybody got to go.
Some sooner than others, and who's to say when that is?
In your case...
Il do.
Listen to that music.
Hey!
Mrs. Stilton?
Mrs. Stilton?
Nobody in here.
Excuse me. I was looking for my friend.
Hello.
Yeah, hello.
I was just dreaming about you.
Me?
Yeah. You was at the club where they play the music.
I was, huh?
Black dress with a white collar.
And one of our guests was the painter Thomas Hart Benton.
You'll have heard of him.
And he saw Lois, and she was part Cherokee... and he wanted to paint her, and she refused.
Tom wanted her to pose...
You had a dream about me?
Yeah. You was up on stage dancing... and Charlie was playing the piano.
Where's your friend, the other lady?
You know me?
I saw you at the club yesterday.
Maybe you dreamed that, too.
No, ma'am.
I saw you there big as day.
You was kicking and screaming, and those men threw you out.
What did they do that for?
How old are you?
Fourteen.
You live here?
No, ma'am. I'm from Joplin.
Me, too.
Come to K.C. to have your baby?
Yeah.
I did the same thing once.
Cigarette?
I never smoked before, but I'll try one.
Tell me, are you familiar with the works... of Annie Fel'lows Johnston?
Yeah.
Yes? Well, well, the South that I saw... is not at all as she depicts it in her novels.
No. In the South that I saw... the Negroes are treated like dirt.
Kansas City bears no resemblance.
You own your home, big enough for your whole family... and your children don't have to work.
We're leaving, Missis.
Somebody's coming to pick up Pearl.
Oh, that's OK. I'll drop her.
I know where she's going.
Hey!
And... they sleep with the hogs.
You can imagine my disappointment.
Well, I'm sure we'll talk again.
All right.
I'll see you at work.
Yeah, see you at work.
Call me, Pearl.
So get out today before the polls close... and cast your vote for the future... and the future of your children.
Vote Democrat.
You ever been away from home before?
Mm-mmm.
You're going to do fine.
Try and get a bed by the window... and don't let them hog the bath on you.
OK.
I don't know what your story is, but you'll do all right.
I was bad off when I came here.
You're fourteen, right?
Yes.
Yeah. See, I was seventeen.
Thought I'd never see Johnny again.
And I didn't see him whole time I was there.
Then later, we got married.
I was at the Crittendon Home.
That's the home for white girls.
Other than that, they're pretty much the same.
It's not bad.
Everyone's in the same way as you are.
They're all having babies.
What did you have, a boy or a girl?
What difference does it make?
A baby's a baby.
You can do whatever you want.
I didn't keep her.
Did you want to keep her?
I wanted whatever Johnny wanted.
Let's go on up.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Easy Eights.
Anne, aren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, you'd better hop to it, girl.
This is the nursery in here.
It's between the girls' bedrooms... and I'll introduce you to the girls... who you'll be sharing a room with.
New roommate, girls.
This is Pearl.
Introduce yourselves, girls.
Hi, Pearl.
The bed in the middle is yours.
Miss?
Hey, kid.
Good luck.
So long.
Sheepshan, my man, how you doing?
Last time I looked in, you had them by the short ones.
I just can't get that out of my head... getting robbed by that white boy.
Shit like that just keeps coming back at you... changing a man's luck.
You know, Seldom, as long as you've known me... losing money has never bothered me much.
As long as you've known me... you can say that's a fair statement, can't you?
I think that's a very fair statement, Sheepshan.
You got a reputation.
You're a good loser.
Last time, you said some other goon was getting him back.
You said it wouldn't be long.
That was almost ten hours ago.
Something's wrong.
I can smell it.
Nothing has gone wrong.
It's just this election and all the mess it's created.
It's just bad timing, that's all.
I don't want to know about timing.
I want to know about my husband.
Is he going to be let go, or not?
Absolutely.
What you have to realize... is that to some people... the outcome of this election is more important... than your husband or my wife.
You're not trying to stall me, are you?
Of course not.
It's just a matter of transporting him... to wherever you want him to be.
Well, when is it going to be... exactly?
Soon. To be safe...
I'd say as soon as the polls close.
Now, remember, my wife's in this, too.
Hey, a deal's a deal.
I got to have Johnny before
I'll turn loose your wife.
And also no one better try to follow him... because if I see anyone suspicious around... your wife will wake up in a pile of dirt... only she won't wake up.
Get it?
There will be no problems, young lady... unless you create them.
Now, I hope you won't go back on your word.
I've never gone back on my word.
It's good we understand each other, mister.
Johnny knows where I'll be.
When I see him and when we can get away safe... then your wife can go, OK?
Yeah, I understand.
You want to say something to her now?
Uh, that's not necessary.
I trust you.
I don't want to get her excited, you know?
Yeah. OK.
You know the story.
Send him home.
He didn't want to talk to me?
What? Oh, yeah. Sure he did.
He just didn't want to, you know, upset you or nothing.
Well, all I know is these women brought her here.
Well, who are these women?
What's their official capacity?
Everyone seems to be ignoring mine.
Well, actually, it was Addie Parker... who called me about her, and I told her about you.
All right.
That's another sore spot.
Just stop right now.
Things are looking good, Red.
You're going to be back with old Heinie... before you know it.
I am not pleased with the way this whole thing... has gone completely haywire.
Blondie, hello. What are you...
Oh, I see.
You found Pearl at the station.
Oh, well, thank you, Blondie.
That was very nice of you.
Nothing to it.
Oh, well... oh, Mrs. Stilton.
Well, I've got things to do.
Thanks for helping out.
Thanks very much.
Lovely to see you,
Mrs. Stilton.
We've met several times.
I'm Nettie Bolt.
The Junior League.
You two know each other, huh?
Oh, I guess so.
You do remember me, don't you, Mrs. Stilton?
Yeah, you're... Nettie Bolt.
Junior League.
I'm sorry. Is it something that I've said?
I...
She's just not remembering things too clearly today.
Know what I mean?
No, Blondie, I have no idea what you mean.
I'm very confused here this afternoon.
Mrs. Stilton kind of got herself hooked on opium.
Good Lord. Opium?
Hey, it's OK.
She's going to be all right.
I'm taking care of things.
Mr. Stilton hired me to look after her at times like this.
Heinie's in Washington, you know?
President Roosevelt.
I'm sorry. Heinie?
Henry.
Oh, yes. Henry Stilton.
Yes. He's a very important man.
Yes, he is.
So at this time, forget about it all.
He doesn't want any nasty scuttlebutting... and especially from someone like you, huh?
Yes, Blondie. I don't gossip.
It's not in my nature.
Well, it was lovely to see you.
I'm off to find Pearl Cummings.
I have these goodies for her.
Hello.
What you going to do to those boys who did it, Seldom?
I've been thinking about that.
Blue is already feeding the dogs.
It's the white boy.
I haven't made a decision on him yet... but I think you got a vote in that.
What do you think?
Shit, I don't know.
It's got to be something bad... considering how my luck is going.
Oh, it's going to be bad.
The question is, how bad?
You go on downstairs, play a little bit more.
We'll take care of it.
Yeah, well, I'm going to need another stake, Seldom.
I think it's time I go against those dice for a while.
I'm going to need another five grand.
Oh, what the hell.
You might as well make it five more... if I'm going to break that game.
Good luck, Sheepshan.
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I'm very tired, I guess, now.
Yeah, well, quit your moping.
You're alive, right?
This is it. Over.
End of the line.
What do you mean?
We're waiting.
Close the door.
Close the door!
We're waiting here for Johnny, then we're leaving.
Don't worry. We'll play clean.
We'll, uh, drop you off someplace... so you can find your way home.
How's that sound?
Sit down.
This must look pretty crummy to you, huh?
Hey, Daisy.
I love it.
Oh, well, that's a shame.
What's a shame?
Well, you're not going to be living here much longer.
Oh, yeah. Right.
So what? I don't care.
Anyplace with Johnny's great with me.
Wherever home is,
I'm going to love it.
I can smell Johnny when I'm in this house.
I don't.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Just kind of jumpy, I guess.
He's not going to be home... until after the polls close anyway.
I know how these politicians think.
So this is Johnny, huh?
Yeah.
Handsome, ain't he?
Yeah. He's a killer.
Yeah. Hey, you see that tie?
I got him that.
Six dollars.
Pretty fancy.
And this is you, right?
Yeah.
Don't you look pretty.
Hey, wait here a second.
Tonk tells me you want to see me.
Well, I've been thinking.
Ain't no way I'm walkin' out of here a free man.
I know that.
One way or the other, you got my life.
It's yours.
I got, uh, no say no more.
I was also thinking... if you kill me, might cost you down the line.
Killing the whitey, I mean... how are they going to look at you... black man killing a white man?
Even if he deserves killing.
See what I'm saying?
Maybe the Italians get down on your ass.
Right now things are good with the Italians. Yeah.
Nobody causes you no trouble, everybody gets along.
Then this robbery happens,
Italians hear about it.
Blue gets fed to the dogs for his part.
What's that?
One nigger kills another, so what?
But killing a white man, that's different... as far as the Italians are concerned.
See what I'm saying?
You know yourself what I'm saying is true.
How's this going to affect you?
That's what we're talking about here, is you.
I figure you already got my life... whether you kill me or not.
I'm your servant.
You want a cup of coffee,
I'll get you coffee.
You want any job done... don't make any difference to me what it is.
You want Blue cut up for dog meat...
I'll do that, too, because I got no say.
I owe my life to you.
That's how you ought to look at this.
Got yourself a slave.
How's that for a switch?
Johnny O'Hara belongs to you.
Johnny O'Hara works for Seldom Seen for life.
How's that sound?
Son of a bitch talks more than I do.
That it?
Yeah.
You got guts.
Yeah, now they're yours.
What do you say?
Your guts?
Everything's yours.
That's OK.
Yeah.
That doctor friend of Bennie Moten's... what's his name? Uh, uh...
Russ Whitehall.
Tell him I want to talk to him.
Red?
Get over here.
I need your help.
Take your coat off.
I'm going to put you to work, little lady.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
Take the comb with the bleach... run it through my hair in sections.
Ooh! This stuff smells bad.
Don't tell me.
Make sure you get the roots.
Is this going to burn?
Burns my scalp, but don't burn your hands.
Just got to wash them real good after.
Last time I did it,
I used too much peroxide... all my hair fell out...
Blah! Right in the sink.
Pink mush.
Thought Johnny was going to leave me.
I looked like a drowned rat.
So what did he do?
He was so sweet.
He said, "Angel, I think it's all going to be all right...
"if I never see you without your hat on..." and he did all the marketing for a whole month.
Oh, that's very sweet.
All right.
I think I've got it now.
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?
Huh?
I'm not getting sentimental or anything.
Don't think that.
I'm just curious.
Where do you think you will go after all this is over?
I don't know.
Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.
Well, it seems like there's a lot you don't tell me.
Like what?
Well, you didn't tell me you had a kid.
I didn't have a kid.
I mean, I had a kid, but I didn't keep her.
So what?
Well, so don't you care what happened to her?
I mean, she must be someplace.
Yeah. In heaven.
Couple from Iowa adopted her.
She had some lung thing.
Couldn't breathe.
She died.
She was only two years old.
She didn't know she was here.
Didn't hurt.
Spitting image, right?
Want something to drink?
Like dipping your tongue in Lux.
Smoke?
You hear something?
Yeah, I think I hear a car.
I think I heard a car.
Johnny.
Hello, angel.
Don't, angel. I'm hurt.
Hmm?
Yeah? Where?
Everywhere.
You want to sit?
Yeah.
Hey, lady, give me a hand, will you?
Hey...
You're freezing cold, Johnny.
Freezing cold.
Those guys are really mad.
Yeah. I got you home, though, didn't I?
Yeah.
Johnny?
God!
What'd they do to you, Johnny?
Red? Red!
They hurt him real bad.
They cut him.
OK. OK.
You're going to be OK.
You're going to be OK.
I got you home.
Red, come here!
You got to help me!
I got to stop the bleeding!
He's bleeding bad!
Red, we really got to...
He's bleeding real bad.
He's bleeding real bad here.
Do something!
Johnny, you're going to be OK.
He's going to be OK, right?
Red, help me!
Please!
Please, Johnny, I can't.
I can't live without you,
Johnny.
Red...
I'm losing him.
Don't leave me.
I'm not going to make it without you.
Red! Please! I can't!
Johnny...
Johnny, don't worry.
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm here. I'm here.
Please help me!
Please help me!
Please.
Good evening, Mrs. Stilton.
Aw, Carolyn...
You know what
I didn't do today?
I didn't vote.
{520}{631}Once upon a time,|there was a princess and a peasant.
{640}{728}She lived atop a hill|in a glittering castle.
{737}{804}There she had a servant|who kept her castle in order...
{820}{897}... selected and pressed her robes|for the day...
{907}{1044}... prepared her royal breakfast|and served it to her in her chambers.
{1056}{1113}- She had fame, she had fortune.|- Bravo. Delightful.
{1117}{1201}She had product endorsements.
{1210}{1304}But she was not what she seemed.
{1317}{1392}On the other hand,|in a humble village far away...
{1400}{1477}... the peasant had none of her luxuries,|but he had a dream.
{1517}{1575}So with a fond farewell|from his closest friends...
{1585}{1666}... and gifts of good luck,|best wishes...
{1675}{1747}... and useless junk...|Although it's the thought that counts.
{1755}{1827}- His world was about to|clash with hers...
{1836}{1893}... in a place called Hollywood.
{1898}{1924}Goodbye!
{5218}{5318}Since I was a little kitten|I had a dream
{5358}{5497}My name in lights|Danny, the song and dance cat
{5543}{5646}I got on a bus and came to the town|Where dreams can come true
{5678}{5723}It's gonna happen for me
{5763}{5814}It could happen for you
{5848}{5872}Who, me?
{5878}{5988}You can do anything|If you try
{6013}{6087}The most impossible dream|Can come true
{6111}{6139}If you believe it
{6148}{6244}This is my kind of town|It's as clear as the nose on your face
{6278}{6372}This is the time|This is the place
{6408}{6432}This is the time
{6438}{6476}- So long.|- Taxi!
{6480}{6562}This must be the place|Hollywood
{6580}{6643}Where the streets|Are paved with gold
{6650}{6713}Where the kitties never grow old
{6718}{6761}In Hollywood
{6811}{6907}Hollywood|Where the stars don 't shine at night
{6923}{7033}They walk around in the broad daylight|In Hollywood
{7103}{7156}Dig that face|They ain 't seen nothing like it
{7161}{7247}Anyplace|It's right above the movie screen
{7256}{7306}If you know what I mean
{7358}{7442}Look at me|I'm gonna be the cat to see
{7455}{7513}I'm going down in history
{7518}{7547}Just watch me!
{8455}{8487}Hollywood
{8518}{8617}Where the streets are paved with gold
{8630}{8731}Where dreams can never grow old

{9396}{9439}What's your name there? Okay.
{9444}{9494}I'm Danny. Do you mind if I sit down?
{9501}{9568}- Excuse me.|- Cranston!
{9576}{9648}Don't mind him, Danny.|He was just leaving.
{9731}{9820}Hi. I'm Tillie. This is Cranston.|Cranston, Danny. Danny, T.W.

{9929}{9984}So, new in town?
{9991}{10063}I just arrived. L...
{10079}{10138}I hear Farley Wink|gets good parts for animals.
{10144}{10194}If you call hanging from a hook|a good part.
{10201}{10237}At least it's a part, huh?
{10244}{10371}There's no use trying, Miss Tillie.|My fortune cookie last night said:
{10378}{10445}"Give it up, you loser."
{10453}{10499}I need a drink.
{10548}{10582}All right, now, let's see.
{10589}{10627}"Go to Hollywood." Check.
{10656}{10690}What you got there?
{10693}{10741}Well, this is a plan I worked out.
{10746}{10870}You see, I figure if I work real hard,|by Friday I'll land my first big part.
{10881}{10944}Well, that's how it worked|for you, right?
{10954}{10992}- Oh, sure. Right.|- Oh, right.
{10999}{11023}Why not Thursday?
{11029}{11098}Now, Danny, you just go in|and let Mr. Wink know you're here.
{11106}{11192}They're casting a big Noah's Ark movie.|Lots of work for animals.
{11201}{11237}Your tie is a little crooked.
{11244}{11311}Wait a minute. Straighten you up,|dust you off and perfect.
{11319}{11364}Good luck.
{11411}{11455}- Thanks a lot.|- Look, you big ape!
{11461}{11517}I need those two monkeys|for another picture.
{11521}{11583}What? This is a bad time.|I'm casting the Ark picture.
{11591}{11646}Get off the line!|Yes, hello. Wink here.
{11698}{11751}- Mr. Wink?|- Yes!
{11756}{11843}If you have any openings for a talented|cat, I'm your man. I mean, your cat.
{11851}{11892}Send over two chickens and two lions.
{11899}{11964}But don't send them over|in the same car this time.
{11979}{12024}Let's see now.
{12129}{12198}- Say, you. Can you play a cat?|- I am a cat.
{12214}{12279}How would you like to be|in the next Darla Dimple picture?
{12291}{12373}The Darla Dimple? America's sweetheart,|lover of children and animals?
{12378}{12443}One and the same, kid.|One and the same.
{12451}{12542}Just sign here, here, here, here,|and here and here and here and here...
{12551}{12599}...and over there and down the middle...
{12709}{12810}- Sawyer, what happened to you?|- Did you walk under a ladder?
{12818}{12845}Smash a mirror?
{12852}{12950}- Have you looked in one lately?|- No. A cat crossed my path.
{12959}{13011}- Really? Orange tabby?|- Yeah.
{13026}{13069}- Green vest? Straw hat?|- Yeah. Yeah.
{13076}{13124}- What a koinky-dink.|- How'd you know?
{13131}{13179}Hippo intuition.
{13239}{13299}- And initial this.|- Wow, this is a dream come true.
{13306}{13392}Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't forget,|10 percent of that dream is mine.
{13401}{13473}Welcome to Hollywood!
{13509}{13557}Farley Wink's Animal Agency.|Can I help you?
{13561}{13621}- You need a lamb for the Moses picture?|- Yeah!
{13629}{13682}Oh, a sacrificial lamb?
{13689}{13751}- No, no.|- Sorry, fresh out.
{13756}{13807}Every day I ask myself|why I put up with this.
{13814}{13864}- For the glamour.|- What, this pigsty?
{13872}{13905}- No offense, Herb.|- None taken.
{13911}{14000}Unless of course, you're|referring to the glamour of filing...
{14009}{14071}...the romance of typing.
{14081}{14146}- Tillie, what are you doing?|- I'm just fixing you up.
{14151}{14233}You'll wanna look pretty|in case you meet someone nice.
{14239}{14304}Yeah, right. As if he'll come waltzing|right through that...
{14312}{14367}You're gonna be fine, kid.|You're the cat's meow.
{14371}{14412}You can meow, can't you?
{14419}{14469}Where's Sawyer?
{14474}{14555}- Sawyer. Sweetie, baby!|- Whatever it is, the answer is no.
{14561}{14590}- I'm in a jam.|- Too bad.
{14596}{14656}- Can't find a female cat for the picture.|- Tough tabby.
{14666}{14717}- So guess who gets to fill in.|- You?
{14724}{14820}Nah, I only fill in|for those dashing Clark Gable types.
{14829}{14867}Frankly, Clark, I don't give a...
{14872}{14920}- Sawyer!|- I'm a secretary, not an actress.
{14927}{14972}- Give you Sundays off.|- Never work Sunday.
{14976}{15003}- Double time.|- Triple.
{15006}{15033}- Triple?|- There an echo?
{15039}{15080}- You're pushing me!|- No chow, no meow.
{15086}{15170}Okay, okay, triple time. Here's your|partner. He's new in town. Be nice.
{15189}{15216}Forget it.
{15219}{15298}A deal is a deal.|Now get on over to Mammoth Pictures.
{15364}{15405}You're...
{15412}{15467}You're... You're soaking wet.
{15474}{15507}Is it raining outside?
{15514}{15603}Because it was sunny when I came in,|and back where I come from...
{15609}{15693}Here, let me get the door for you.|Where I come from you see clouds first.
{15702}{15726}- Stay.|- After you.
{15732}{15789}And then the rain comes after it.
{15886}{15953}I'm sorry. Miss?
{16394}{16456}Oh, I'm telling you,|one more plucking scene...
{16464}{16507}...and... right in the gizzard.
{16512}{16610}So aggravating and humiliating.|I'm out of this picture business.
{16619}{16719}There's no place like home.|There's no place like home.
{16817}{16906}So I guess we're gonna be|the only two cats on the ark, huh?
{16915}{16989}- Pretty great, huh?|- So much for preserving the species.
{17004}{17061}Hey, Kong, how's the picture coming?
{17081}{17156}Don't get me started!
{17201}{17254}You know the King?
{17267}{17317}On my side of the tram,|home of Darla Dimple...
{17324}{17389}...America's sweetheart.|Look for Darla in Lil Ark Angel...
{17394}{17452}...coming soon to a theater near you.
{17525}{17587}All right, everybody.|We're ready for Darla's big ark.
{17629}{17711}Hey. Hey, mister. I could|help you push that cart, you know.
{17720}{17772}Hey. What are you doing?|Get out of here, kid.
{17777}{17820}Let me help, will you?
{17827}{17875}I'm little but I'm strong.
{17882}{17946}- These sweets are for Miss Dimple.|- Okay, all right.
{17954}{18009}You don't have to get mad.
{18047}{18078}I'm busted.
{18085}{18111}- Hey.|- Hey.
{18117}{18155}You're the cat from this morning?
{18162}{18253}- What are you doing here?|- That ice thing is just my side job.
{18262}{18298}Name's Peabo Pudgemyer.
{18301}{18352}But you can call me Pudge.
{18359}{18434}Time to start.|Better go get your costume.
{18527}{18553}Script! Script! Script!
{18587}{18649}"Meow"? Is that all?|Where's the rest?
{18657}{18722}- You're looking at it.|- But I thought this was a musical.
{18727}{18777}We're supposed to sing and dance,|aren't we?
{18782}{18851}Oh, for the love of Moby Dick.
{18859}{18957}Listen, tiger, this town has rules.|Around here, cats say "meow."
{18967}{19075}But that's so old hat. I'm sure|no one would mind if I jazz this up a bit.
{19081}{19146}All right, learn it the hard way.
{19302}{19405}Meow, see.|Yeah, that's it, meow, meow.
{19427}{19485}Quiet on the set, please. Quiet!
{19492}{19554}Miss Dimple is ready to begin.
{19562}{19626}Lights! Camera!
{19672}{19725}Action.
{19732}{19777}Cue the elephant.
{19832}{19865}Tusk, tusk, hair.
{19872}{19946}- The hair, the hair, fix the hair.|- Sorry.
{20335}{20414}Now, the people, they were so bad
{20423}{20497}That the Lord made the rain come down
{20509}{20579}And he washed away their bad cities
{20587}{20659}And he washed away their bad towns
{20675}{20749}And all of the people drowned
{20845}{20914}With the animals it was different
{20920}{20992}Though some of them drowned too
{21008}{21077}The others were just poor animals
{21082}{21181}And they didn 't know what to do
{21187}{21285}So I built a little boat
{21307}{21367}As cute as it can be
{21387}{21504}And I put all the animals two by two|In my little boat on the sea
{21530}{21561}The moo cows went:
{21600}{21631}The piggies went:
{21672}{21735}And all the little birdies went|Tweet, tweet, tweet
{21742}{21795}In my little boat on the sea
{21815}{21853}The doggy went:
{21892}{21923}The kitty cat went:
{21990}{22026}The lion went:
{22207}{22339}- In my little boat on the sea|- Talking about the boat on the sea
{22450}{22496}On the sea
{22568}{22592}Meow?
{22597}{22693}- Cut! Cut, cut, cut!|- Cut? Yes, cut.
{22702}{22750}Let me down this instant!
{22757}{22800}Lower Miss Dimple! Lower her!
{22804}{22852}Hurry! Hurry! Lower Miss Dimple!
{22915}{22989}Darla. Darla, darling. Here...
{23105}{23223}Flanigan, the title of this movie|is Lil Ark Angel.
{23250}{23296}- Isn't it?!|- Yes. Yes.
{23300}{23374}And who here is an angel?
{23385}{23437}Can you tell me who here is an angel?!
{23445}{23534}Why you are, Darla, sweetheart,|celebrity, darling.
{23543}{23627}- Angel.|- That's right! I am an angel!
{23632}{23750}I am an adorable little angel!
{23760}{23794}Bonbons will make it better.
{23797}{23838}- Hot fudge sundae?|- Your choo-choo?
{23845}{23876}Your ducky?
{23883}{23984}I hate animals!
{23992}{24031}Especially that one!
{24135}{24190}Get me down from here!
{24197}{24259}Flanigan!
{24287}{24350}Oh, dear, what a calamity.
{24545}{24620}Max!
{24627}{24673}We're doomed.
{24702}{24745}Hide me!
{25317}{25399}Yes, Miss Dimple.
{25563}{25628}Been nice knowing you, pal.
{25950}{26024}How does the kitty cat go?
{26058}{26094}Meow?
{26108}{26189}Very good.
{26262}{26341}Will that be all, Miss Dimple?
{26350}{26449}For the moment. Thank you, Max.
{26715}{26768}- Your curls are fine.|- Your nails are precious.
{26772}{26828}- Goodbye, Miss Dimple.|- Goodbye, Miss Dimple.
{26900}{26948}Okay, everybody. From the top.
{26963}{27090}And I hope there will be|no more interruptions.
{27255}{27361}- Cue me, Frances.|- So the kitty cat went:
{27445}{27486}Now, just cut that out.
{27491}{27560}Besides, it was much more like:
{27825}{27878}Danny, wait.
{27943}{28014}Now see what you made me do.
{28042}{28081}Oh, dear.
{28085}{28128}Maybe one of us should talk to him.
{28135}{28209}Hello. I'll do it.|It's time somebody set that cat straight.
{28218}{28300}Since he tap-danced into town,|he's been nothing but trouble.
{28321}{28426}Well, I guess this is gonna|set me back a whole day.
{28475}{28533}Maybe only half a day.
{28541}{28617}Listen, I'm sorry your feelings got hurt,|but the fact is, since you...
{28625}{28690}I don't get it.|What happened in there, anyway?
{28711}{28742}- Did I hit a sour note?|- Wait.
{28748}{28800}Because if I did,|I could go back in there.
{28808}{28885}- I could fix it.|- You don't... Danny, they don't care.
{28890}{28931}- But l...|- Don't you get it?
{28938}{29029}What is it with you? Why are you so|determined to make a fool of yourself?
{29046}{29096}What do you mean?
{29101}{29163}All I wanna do is the thing I love.
{29171}{29207}Doesn't everyone?
{29303}{29399}- It's not that simple.|- It is in Kokomo.
{29416}{29502}Then maybe that's|where you should have stayed.
{29970}{30071}You can do anything|If you...
{30094}{30129}I better not sing right now.
{30230}{30281}You want some?
{30316}{30354}No thanks, Pudge.
{30358}{30413}I was gonna slug|that big dumb Max for you...
{30421}{30493}...but I didn't wanna hurt the guy.
{30528}{30595}So, what's that Dimple kid's problem?
{30600}{30675}- I thought you were great today.|- I'm glad you liked it.
{30686}{30753}You know, all that:
{30801}{30873}No, it's a little more like...
{30881}{30950}Here, I'll show you.
{31563}{31611}Hey, hey, hey.
{31618}{31707}Wait a minute. Where's...?|Where's that music coming from?
{32230}{32310}- It's him. It's Woolie the Mammoth.|- It's him. It's Woolie the Mammoth.
{32573}{32657}That's it! B flat.
{32663}{32793}Why, you have a natural rear for music,|little fellow. Little fellow.
{32836}{32946}If my old eyes aren't failing me,|I'd say...
{32956}{33040}...you're the fellow|who caused all that commotion today.
{33069}{33145}Yeah. I guess I really upset Miss Dimple.
{33151}{33213}Yes, you did.
{33221}{33286}Jolly good show!
{33353}{33430}- Tea time. Would you chaps like a cup?|- Sure.
{33436}{33556}Splendid! It's a special peanut brew|from India, the upper regions.
{33731}{33796}Did you know the peanut|is not a nut at all?
{33804}{33892}And it's not a pea|for that matter either.
{34003}{34085}It's rather odd that they call it a nut|because it isn't a nut, you see.
{34094}{34187}It's... It's... It's a member|of the legume family.
{34198}{34237}Sugar?
{34244}{34373}- Yeah.|- Wait, wait. How about pea legume?
{34384}{34427}No, that wouldn't make sense either.
{34434}{34520}But whatever it is,|it makes a splendid tea.
{34651}{34757}My grandmother developed this recipe,|with certain additions from yours truly.
{34774}{34827}I forgot the cream.|Would you like some cream?
{34833}{34872}- No, no!|- Don't go to any trouble!
{34876}{34941}All right. All right.|Suit yourself, suit yourself.
{35024}{35110}That music was great, Woolie.|Did you write it for some movie?
{35124}{35186}No, no, it's not for any movie.
{35194}{35297}I used to hope that one day|I'd write music for the motion pictures.
{35307}{35414}But all they wanted me for|was to put on those beastly tusks and...
{35546}{35591}...at the beginning of every film.
{35599}{35695}- What a waste of your talent.|- Oh, it's the same for everyone.
{35701}{35735}Look behind you.
{35779}{35894}So many, many broken dreams.
{35958}{35992}Is that Sawyer?
{36019}{36110}Poor Sawyer.|I thought she'd be the one to make it.
{36119}{36212}Such a dancer|with the voice of an angel.
{36221}{36262}I never would have guessed.
{36269}{36333}That's what this town does to you,|my boy.
{36339}{36368}It wears you down.
{36373}{36443}But I thought Hollywood|was always looking for new talent.
{36452}{36560}Talented people, not animals.
{36629}{36665}You see...
{36672}{36756}...the spotlight will never be|on fellows like you and me.
{36776}{36855}And it's foolish|to think otherwise, Danny.
{36919}{36960}Danny?
{36967}{37034}Yeah. Foolish.
{37273}{37307}Unless...
{37371}{37397}...we can remind them.
{37439}{37525}- Of what?|- Why they came here in the first place.
{37652}{37714}All right, all of you, listen up!
{37722}{37803}I only need you, water buffalo,|for the Tarzan jungle stampede.
{37811}{37866}The rest of you, go home.
{37874}{37994}Well, today's shot.|Might as well go home and clean.
{38284}{38327}Here's our chance, Pudge. Come on!
{38357}{38409}Hey, everybody!
{38474}{38553}Look who's back.|I wish he'd get himself stuffed.
{38559}{38633}I know a divine taxidermist, darling.
{38639}{38682}Did my first husband.
{38704}{38766}Come on, everybody, gather around
{38774}{38829}Don 't let this old town get you down
{38856}{38919}Look at you there|With the long, long face
{38929}{38981}Hey, he must be talking to you.
{38994}{39109}You take this and you take that|Come on over here, T. W., put on this hat
{39119}{39208}If we all work together|We can make our dreams come true
{39224}{39291}Let's show the world what we can do
{39334}{39406}- Pudge?|- Yeah.
{39887}{39952}Boogie with me!
{40062}{40131}I got rhythm in my feet
{40164}{40226}I got rhythm in my heart and soul
{40269}{40346}I got rhythm, hot and sweet
{40375}{40434}Sometimes rhythm|Makes me lose control
{40484}{40599}I want everyone to have all the fun
{40631}{40667}That I have
{40692}{40778}I've got rhythm|So do you
{40790}{40847}Let's turn it on|And show what we can do
{40851}{40887}Bye!
{41529}{41563}Perfect.
{41567}{41661}How could you possibly|improve a face like this?
{41690}{41733}What is that hideous racket?
{42379}{42444}Look at them.|I'm ashamed to be an animal.
{42450}{42538}Shut up, you old nanny,|and show old Franny what you got.
{42602}{42640}Hey.
{43629}{43742}Come on, Sawyer.|Grab a partner and do-si-do.
{43844}{43912}Hey, Sawyer, dance with me?|I hear you're a natural.
{43919}{43948}Who told you that?
{43989}{44066}Listen, it's a waste of time.|You'll never get to dance in the movies.
{44074}{44132}Movies? Did I say movies?|No, we're just having fun.
{44139}{44185}Yeah, sure. Forget it.
{44447}{44558}Just look at those fools.|Laughable, isn't it, Max?
{44570}{44608}Max?
{44710}{44744}Max!
{44885}{44962}Not bad. A little rusty|but, hey, who's perfect?
{44967}{45010}Rusty?
{45189}{45242}I'll give you rusty.
{46148}{46222}Like I said, dancing's a waste of time.
{46242}{46304}What if I could get you|an audition with L.B. Mammoth?
{46309}{46386}L.B. Mammoth?|Head of Mammoth Studios?
{46397}{46455}- What?|- I know he'd appreciate real talent.
{46462}{46548}After nothing but Darla,|he's gotta be starving for it.
{46602}{46681}- You're dreaming, Danny.|- Maybe I am.
{46688}{46752}But so were you|just a few minutes ago.
{47030}{47095}Can you really get us an audition|with the boss, Danny?
{47100}{47126}It's worth a try.
{47130}{47250}Once he sees us, there'll be|a whole new set of stars in town.
{47280}{47340}An audition?
{47355}{47443}Max! Invite that cat...
{47452}{47534}...to tea.
{47625}{47685}Thanks for coming over, Donald.
{47690}{47726}Danny.
{47740}{47769}Danny.
{47777}{47806}Animal cracker?
{47840}{47893}No? More for me.
{47960}{48061}I wanted to apologize|for what Max did the other day.
{48073}{48157}He's so bad sometimes.
{48165}{48232}- No, it's all right, Miss Dimple. Really.|- No, no, no.
{48239}{48311}It was terrible. Awful.
{48318}{48361}Cruel.
{48370}{48452}Inappropriately violent.
{48475}{48537}And I wanna make it all up to you.
{48555}{48619}No, no, you don't have to.
{48640}{48681}Oh, I insist.
{48688}{48762}- Is there anything you need?|- No.
{48770}{48861}Isn't there something I could do for you?
{48870}{48913}I don't think so.
{48922}{48999}Isn't there a certain someone|who runs a certain studio...
{49008}{49087}...that I could introduce you to?
{49168}{49206}Well...
{49235}{49314}Is there any way that you can arrange|for me and the other animals...
{49323}{49366}...to perform for L.B. Mammoth?
{49373}{49440}Why, Denis, I'd be delighted.
{49445}{49493}Idea!
{49500}{49567}Maybe you can all do a number|in my movie.
{49572}{49642}- You...? You mean it?|- Why, it's just what the picture needs.
{49650}{49724}- Oh, but I couldn't impose.|- I'll give you use of my sound stage...
{49733}{49793}...my ark, and anything else|you might need.
{49801}{49863}- Really?|- You get all your little friends ready...
{49867}{49956}...and I'll make sure L.B.|Sees your splashy debut.
{49965}{50039}- Oh, thank you, Miss Dimp...|- Call me Darla.
{50046}{50120}- Thank you, Darla.|- Don't mention it.
{50145}{50232}Sawyer could do a romantic ballad,|and Woolie can even play a piano solo.
{50302}{50338}Did you hear that, Max?
{50345}{50403}Woolie, the elephant...
{50411}{50468}...can even play a solo.
{50535}{50591}Don't you think|that would be a good idea?
{50597}{50645}Well, I think...
{50650}{50760}- You really want my advice?|- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, please.
{50770}{50818}Well...
{51071}{51174}I've seen 'em come|And I've seen 'em go
{51185}{51271}There's one thing that I know
{51280}{51373}You gotta give the people|What they want
{51393}{51506}Or you'll wind up back in Kokomo
{51523}{51575}Nebraska
{51606}{51670}- Indiana, Miss Dimple.|- Whatever.
{51675}{51775}They like it big, they like it loud
{51801}{51889}Maybe a little bit jazzy sometimes
{51898}{52001}Mr. Pussycat, listen to me
{52010}{52080}You don 't have to be good
{52087}{52214}But you had better be
{52225}{52261}Get hot, Miss Dimple.
{52278}{52357}Big and loud
{52386}{52438}Big and loud
{52481}{52565}Gonna make your mama proud
{52615}{52656}Make it big
{52733}{52908}And loud
{53270}{53386}Leaves you kind of speechless, don't it?
{53400}{53462}- Thank you, Darla.|- Oh, no, no, no.
{53470}{53535}I just made a few|professional "suggestments."
{53545}{53624}You just get all your little friends ready|by Friday at 3...
{53631}{53669}...and I'll take care of L.B.
{53676}{53753}And let's keep this between us,|shall we?
{53760}{53851}I don't like to advertise|my charitable work.
{53860}{53930}Oh, sure. Thanks, Miss Dimple.
{53935}{53990}- Thanks a lot.|- You're welcome, Dino.
{53996}{54049}- Goodbye.|- Ta-ta!
{54060}{54122}See you in the movies.
{54288}{54315}Publicity Department.
{54320}{54388}Is L.B.'s big press conference|still Friday at 3?
{54393}{54503}- Yes, it is, Miss Dimple.|- Oh, thank you so much.
{54746}{54830}I didn 't get where I am today
{54851}{54947}By letting myself get pushed around
{54998}{55123}No man or beast or kitty cat or doggie
{55143}{55242}Is going to drag me down
{55261}{55295}Shut up, Max.
{55300}{55382}The lightning will be flashing
{55400}{55470}The thunder, it will roar
{55495}{55572}They'll never know what hit 'em
{55583}{55706}Wait'll they see what I have in store
{55733}{55810}Big and loud
{55819}{55917}It's gonna be big and loud
{55941}{56083}When they fall, they'll really fall
{56103}{56189}And they're gonna fall big
{56225}{56336}And they're gonna fall loud
{56359}{56430}They're gonna fall big
{56448}{56505}And
{56624}{56655}Shut up, Max.
{56665}{56783}Loud
{56958}{57047}"Thunder and lightning." Check.|Special effects all ready, Danny.
{57066}{57136}All right, everybody.|Mr. Mammoth will be here any minute.
{57141}{57225}Get into position. Remember,|do it just like you did in the alley.
{57231}{57294}Only make it big and loud this time.
{57300}{57396}- And don't be nervous.|- Nervous? Why would I be nervous?
{57421}{57449}Give me that.
{57591}{57684}Well, well. Run of the sound stage,|use of Darla's ark costumes.
{57694}{57787}- I don't know. Something smells fishy.|- I beg your pardon.
{57794}{57885}- Sorry, it's just that I smell a rat.|- Excuse me?
{57891}{57963}- Never mind.|- So you decided to join us, huh?
{57971}{58033}Me? Oh, no, no, no.|This is never gonna work.
{58039}{58108}Besides, how did you arrange all of this?
{58130}{58190}Let's just say|a little angel's looking out for us.
{58198}{58249}- Oh, boy.|- Come on, Sawyer.
{58256}{58338}Your life isn't back there|in that office, it's here.
{58346}{58422}- It's 3:00, Danny.|- Dance with me.
{58493}{58524}See you onboard.
{58531}{58584}- Well?|- I can't do this.
{58591}{58634}- And?|- I can't do this.
{58638}{58724}- So?|- I can't believe I'm doing this.
{58733}{58851}Fortune says, "Rough waters ahead."
{58861}{58892}Start the rain, Pudge!
{58896}{58992}When L.B. Shows up,|we'll all come out singing and dancing.
{59216}{59264}Ladies and gentlemen of the press...
{59268}{59333}...I bring you|the founder of Mammoth Pictures...
{59341}{59446}...Mr. L.B. Mammoth!
{59613}{59688}Gee whiz, Mr. Mammoth,|what's the secret of your success?
{59741}{59816}Simple. It's Dimple.
{59866}{59957}Dainty, delightful, Darla Dimple
{59984}{60049}The recipe for a Darla Dimple movie.
{60053}{60173}Begin with one part adorable character|in jeopardy.
{60227}{60349}Sorry, penguin, but into each life,|a little rain must fall.
{60359}{60428}Max, man the valve.
{60436}{60527}Yes, Miss Dimple.
{60613}{60680}Add two parts perky determination.
{60694}{60776}More water, Max. More water.
{60883}{60950}Sprinkle in an air of innocence.
{60964}{61048}Wind, Max. We must have wind!
{61346}{61420}- Stir in...|- More water!
{61513}{61573}- Add a pinch of...|- Thunder!
{61754}{61830}- And an itsy-bitsy dash of...|- Lightning!
{62144}{62206}Mix it all together|and what do you get?
{62946}{63021}Throw the anchor!|Somebody throw the anchor.
{63236}{63299}It's L.B.! We're on!
{63339}{63442}Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag|And smile, smile, smile
{63452}{63538}"Your life isn't back there at the office,"|he says. "Dance with me," he says.
{63544}{63628}You know what your problem is? You're|pushy, self-centered, pigheaded...
{63636}{63670}- No offense, Herb.|- None taken.
{63697}{63783}Action. We're pushing, we're pushing.|We're running, we're running.
{63821}{63893}And your driving stinks!
{63901}{63966}Well, maybe you could do better.|Go ahead, you take it.
{63971}{64024}- You take it.|- You take it.
{64032}{64111}- No, no, no.|- If you think you know so much...
{64132}{64170}- Sawyer!|- I don't want it.
{64174}{64244}Well, it doesn't get any worse than this.
{64289}{64349}I was wrong. It's worse.
{64447}{64509}Oh, my. This is an awkward moment.|I don't think we met.
{64517}{64579}I'm Tillie. Mr. Mammoth, Cranston.|Cranston, Mr. Mammoth.
{64584}{64612}Flanigan, Cranston...
{64851}{64938}What appears to be a tidal wave,|folks, is actually just a special effect.
{65082}{65166}- This has gone far enough. Give me that.|- You didn't want it before. Give it.
{65175}{65258}Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt|or anything, but we're about to...
{65266}{65326}- Will you just stay out of this?|- Oh, sorry.
{65332}{65399}- Let go. Let go.|- I'm telling you...
{65447}{65500}- Good day, Mr. Mammoth.|- Good day, Mr. Mammoth.
{66009}{66079}You animals will never...
{66087}{66166}Nibble kibble in this town again!
{66209}{66267}I think they liked it.
{66297}{66350}But it wasn't...
{66364}{66424}It wasn't their fault.
{66822}{66905}Nice working with you, Danny.
{66989}{67056}Let go! Let me go!
{67069}{67143}Singing and dancing animals.
{67287}{67330}She was your little angel?
{67367}{67415}She said she wanted to help us.
{67429}{67525}- And you believed her?|- But... But l...
{67662}{67772}Woolie, I would... I'd...
{67787}{67885}The spotlight will never be|on fellows like you and me.
{67907}{67955}Go home, son.
{68027}{68070}Go home.
{68434}{68532}Goodbye, show biz. Hello, farm work.
{68542}{68607}Well, there's always Broadway.|Yeah, Broadway.
{68615}{68660}I hear hippos are very big|on Broadway.
{68667}{68722}They're big everywhere, darling.
{68735}{68804}You know, this is all Danny's fault.
{68812}{68884}You got it, brother.|That toe-tapping tom!
{68889}{68949}I never trusted him. Too happy.
{68973}{69042}Well, I have to admit,|we were better off before.
{69050}{69167}Well, let's face it. That cat|ruined our already miserable lives.
{69177}{69239}Well, he's just a...|He's a crackerjack is what he is.
{69245}{69324}- She's right. You're doggone right.|- Nothing but trouble, that guy.
{69332}{69375}- Horrid little being.|- Bad luck!
{69382}{69449}Old happy feet better not|show his face around here again.
{69710}{69794}I never believed|That there was a rainbow
{69812}{69877}With a pot of gold at the end
{69907}{70010}I'm much too smart|For fairy tales like that
{70032}{70123}Yet here I am again
{70159}{70248}I thought this time|This time we're gonna make it
{70272}{70351}Why I thought so, I really don 't know
{70385}{70462}Maybe something in his eyes
{70467}{70587}Just told me so
{70697}{70879}Something in his eyes
{70960}{71089}Tell me lies
{71127}{71228}And I'll come runnin '
{71309}{71463}I must have lost my mind
{71510}{71647}I could close my eyes
{71683}{71798}And tell you|Just exactly what's comin '
{71865}{71946}Life's gonna turn
{71975}{72049}Just a little unkind
{72188}{72320}Seems like everyone's sailin '|Way out on the sea
{72350}{72438}And I'm stuck here on the shore
{72520}{72659}Sun 's always shinin '|But it's never for me
{72687}{72846}Why should I try anymore?
{72870}{73002}Tell me lies, tell me lies
{73035}{73147}I'll just keep right on comin '
{73188}{73320}This time I've got|To believe
{73358}{73499}In the dream
{73520}{73594}This time I've got
{73637}{73702}To believe
{73720}{73962}In his dream
{74245}{74286}Tillie!
{74388}{74522}You know, you can|still catch him at the bus stop.
{75115}{75171}Danny! Wait! Danny!
{76020}{76114}So I guess it's just you|and me tonight, buddy.
{76175}{76254}Hey, did you hear about that disaster|down at Mammoth Pictures?
{76263}{76330}Oh, boy!|What were those animals thinking?
{76338}{76403}I mean, what a bunch of noodleheads.
{76410}{76466}No offense.|I'm not calling you a noodlehead.
{76472}{76528}It's just that|they don't belong in pictures.
{76533}{76598}They belong back on the farm.
{76633}{76748}Look at them out there.|Poor fools. They ain't got no future.
{76783}{76840}What am I telling you for?|You're heading home.
{76848}{76906}You're not trying to be|something you ain't.
{76912}{76984}You're leaving this mess all behind.
{76993}{77065}You know your place.|I mean, I know my place, you know.
{77073}{77157}It's here driving this bus.|You know, you don't see me...
{77208}{77235}Stop the bus!
{77293}{77377}Jeez! What do you wanna stop for?|We just barely got started.
{77406}{77490}Exactly. See you in the movies.

{80436}{80517}- Move!|- Excuse me.
{80526}{80586}Can I just squeeze past, son?
{80590}{80650}Thank you very much.
{80698}{80754}Oh, so sorry.
{81374}{81470}They're in. The minute|the movie ends, we go on.
{81476}{81543}Yea, as you walk|through your valley of despair...

{82465}{82523}It's almost time. I'll go set the lights.
{82531}{82574}Check.
{82658}{82768}The weatherman says it's going to rain|for 40 days and 40 nights.
{82776}{82896}Hark, here comes a big fat rain cloud.
{83293}{83346}Danny. Look behind you, Danny.
{83354}{83382}Danny.
{84864}{84955}Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
{84964}{85074}Nice kitty, kitty.
{86617}{86650}How does the kitty cat go?
{86709}{86760}Meow?
{86771}{86802}Very good.
{87086}{87170}Danny, the movie's over!|Everybody's leaving! We gotta...

{87944}{87977}Have I?
{87984}{88099}A special live show|with an all-animal cast.
{88144}{88195}- Not this guppy.|- Yeah. No, I'm with her.
{88202}{88252}Come on, Sawyer.
{88279}{88365}Unheard of, yes, of course,|but not for "America's sweetheart...
{88372}{88434}...Iover of children and animals."
{88607}{88631}Max?
{88664}{88741}No, no, no. Now, don't try|to share the credit.
{88746}{88825}You're the one who wanted us|to perform for L.B.
{88839}{88957}And I wouldn't dream of performing|without my frie...
{89029}{89106}l... l...
{89122}{89227}Silly cat. Run along now.|Skit scat, Mr. Kitty Cat.
{89249}{89348}Isn't he cute?|Run along and play, Mr. Kitty.
{89504}{89533}Sawyer?
{89537}{89602}We're all behind you, Danny.|One hundred percent.
{89607}{89648}- Don't let them go.|- I got them.
{89655}{89760}- Let go! Have you lost your mind?|- Release me, you mad hippo!
{89769}{89798}- Wait!|- One big happy family!
{89804}{89857}- Just a minute.|- "You will meet with disaster!"
{89864}{89910}- Would you listen?|- I'll chew your ears...
{89914}{89967}- Cranston!|- "The end is near! Fat lady's sung!"
{89975}{90061}Look, if you're willing to accept|what they think of you, then you can go.
{90089}{90125}I almost did.
{90129}{90201}Well, you should have.|Life here for animals is the pits.
{90209}{90247}We're always playing the scapegoat.
{90254}{90324}- Quickly forgotten.|- Working for scale.
{90331}{90377}Then why are you still here?
{90424}{90477}Because you can't forget the feeling,|can you?
{90497}{90593}The feeling you have|when you two dance together...
{90617}{90643}...when you play...
{90662}{90707}...when you sing.
{90724}{90781}They cursed you, humiliated you...
{90787}{90916}...even slammed the door in your face,|but they still haven't made you forget.
{90925}{90968}Have they?
{91025}{91087}"They can smash your cookie...
{91095}{91186}...but you'll always have your fortune."
{91344}{91421}Come on. Let's go show them|what we can do.
{91429}{91465}Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
{91474}{91608}Well, it is kind of getting|kind of more or less rather late.
{91630}{91683}You couldn't be more right.|Hit it, Pudge!
{91771}{91872}Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen|If you would be so kind
{91897}{92051}I've got someone very special here|She's about to speak her mind
{92097}{92150}I've got a song to sing
{92190}{92259}If you don 't like my song|I'm gonna sing it anyhow

{92352}{92414}- Nothing's gonna stop us now|- Nothing's gonna stop us now
{92630}{92707}You take four and 20 blackbirds|And bake them in a pie
{92730}{92787}Before you put 'em in the oven|You know they're gonna fly
{92794}{92818}And they'll get you
{92825}{92952}They say curiosity killed the cat|I'm living proof that that's a lie
{93029}{93089}- Now I'm gonna tell you why|- Now I'm gonna tell you why

{94660}{94705}Been knocked down, cut down|Locked down, shut down

{98290}{98342}NEW STARS IN HOLLYWOOD
{98382}{98782}Downloaded From www.AllSubs.org
"The movie will begin in five moments,"
The mindless voice announced.
"All those unseated will await the next show. "
We filed slowly, languidly, into the hall.
The auditorium was vast and silent.
As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued.
"The program for this evening is not new.
"You've seen this entertainment through and through.
"You've seen your birth, your life and death.
"You might recall all of the rest.
Did you have a good world when you died?
"Enough to base a movie on?"
Hey, Jim. It's your birthday, man.
What do you say we finish this another night?
Turn the lights down a little bit more.
Hey, how come The Doors aren't in on this?
No music, no Doors. Come on, let's roll.
Rolling.
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin.
"Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god...
"Wandering, wandering in hopeless night.
"Out here in the perimeter there are no stars...
"Out here we is stoned
"Immaculate."
It's beautiful.
Look at those big, fluffy clouds.
Hey, Jimmy.
Wake up and look at the clouds. Come on.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Officer, what happened?
Anything we can do to help?
- No, sir, we've got everything under control.
- It's all right.
Just a dream, Jimmy. That's all it is.
It's just a dream.
...in the cactus moonlight, waiting for the medicine...
I'll go get it. Wait here. Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right here.
Hi.
You got a problem with doors?
Waste of time.
I followed you from the beach.
You followed me?
Why?
'Cause you're the one.
Maybe you should meet my old man.
What's your name?
- Mine's Jim.
- Pam.
Pam and Jim.
Who the hell was that?
I have no idea.
Nietzsche said...
"All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks...
"in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity.
"Listen, children, to the sound of the Nuremberg night. "
Heil!
In the séance, the shaman leads a sensuous panic.
He acts like a madman.
A professional hysteria.
Have you ever seen God?
A mandala.
A symmetrical angel.
We got our final vision by clap
Columbus' groin got filled with green death
I touched her thigh...
This film is weak.
... and death smiled.
Hey, Morrison. Fuck them, man.
It's great, it's non-linear. It's poetry.
It's everything Godard stands for.
This world. The monster of energy.
Without beginning. Without end.
Likewise, without increase or income...
disclosing nothing...
this world...
This world is a will to power...
and nothing besides.
Very pretentious there, Jim.
Not easy to follow. A little incoherent.
But, dancing bears, Nazism, masturbation, what's next?
What do you guys think?
- It's boring. I hated it.
- It's better than a Warhol picture.
- No, it wasn't. It was worse.
- The guy is sleeping for seven hours.
- It was nice.
- There was no political content.
You need your art spoon-fed to you.
Right on, man.
All right, hold it down.
Let's ask the filmmaker what he thinks.
- Shut up!
- Mr. Morrison?
I quit.
Awake
Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see
Come on out for a walk.
It's a beautiful night.
A vast radiant beach in a cool jewelled moon
Couples naked race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the woolly cotton brains of infancy
Every time I try to make love to you
You run around with your mouth stuck out
Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances
I can't believe it's so beautiful up here.
"Now I have come again to the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise.
"Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
O children of Night
"Who among you will run with the hunt?
"Now Night arrives with her purple legion.
"Retire now to your tents and dreams.
"Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth.
"I want to be ready."
That's beautiful.
- Did you like that?
- It's beautiful.
I've never read much poetry before.
What's a shaman?
That's a medicine man... of the Indians.
He gets into a peyote trance... and he gets deeper and deeper, and then he has a vision... and the whole tribe is healed.
All cultures have a version of it.
The Greeks have theatre and gods.
The Indians say the first shaman invented sex.
They call him,
"The One Who Makes You Crazy."
What turns you on?
I don't know.
Experience... freedom... love.
Now.
Did you know that the first time I did acid, I saw God?
And I saw a friend of mine, he was Christ, but he was Judas, too.
And then I realized that somehow that was the secret of everything.
We're all one. The universe is one.
And that everything is beautiful.
I don't know.
I feel most alive... confronting death... experiencing pain.
I think you're most alive by recognising beauty.
Seeing truth.
Does death turn you on?
You love death?
Life hurts a lot more.
When you die, the pain's over.
All the poems have wolves in it.
All but one.
The most beautiful one of all.
"She dances in a ring of fire.
"And throws off the challenge with a shrug."
That's beautiful.
Who did you write that for?
I wrote it for you.
- Try acid, Ray.
- Shit.
It's guaranteed.
Shit, Morrison.
- My last trip was a real bummer, man.
- I never had a bummer on acid.
No, I'm trying naturally high now.
Yeah, whatever works.
You making movies at MGM yet?
I got in to see the head of production, and he said:
"Where is your script?"
I said, "I don't need a script.
"Godard doesn't use a script, he improvises with a camera."
He says, "Great. Who's Godard?"
I'm off movies, man.
I went out to the desert, got lost.
I've been living up on Trick's rooftop.
- Got stuck on a chick.
- So what else you doing?
Writing. Songs, poems, stuff like that.
You write songs?
Why don't you let me hear one?
I'm shy.
- Sing it to me.
- I can't sing.
You must sing better than Dylan.
Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
Let me hear your words.
All right.
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evening that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Those are great fucking lyrics, man.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You write this? You got others in here?
A bunch, man.
I have a whole concert in my head.
- I see it all like...
- What happened to you in the desert?
- Ecstasy and madness.
- Let's get a band together and make money.
- I've got tons of songs.
- Things will explode. You can feel it.
People wanna fight or fuck, love or kill.
Vietnam is right out there, man.
Sides are being chosen.
Everything's gonna flame, man.
The planet is screaming for change,
Morrison. We gotta make the myths.
There ought to be great orgies, man.
Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece.
He made all the women mad, leaving their homes... and dancing off into the mountains.
There should be great golden copulations in the streets of LA, man.
- We should call ourselves Dionysus.
- I got a name. The Doors.
You mean, "The doors in your mind"?
The Huxley book.
- The Doors of Perception. Acid.
- That's great.
The quote's from William Blake.
"When the doors of perception are cleansed...
"things will appear as they truly are: infinite."
I like it.
Come on!
Yeah, you know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through
Break on through
- What's the matter?
- That's not it. This doesn't sound right.
- I know that, John.
- Jim, man, stay in time.
- I say we try that bossa nova beat.
- We're still learning that.
I think it's hot!
I think the lyric's kind of weird, man.
You write one, man.
We need more songs anyway, man.
I thought it was pretty good.
Let's go outside.
I came up with something.
A-minor and F-sharp.
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher
Come on, baby, light my fire
G- A-D
Pretty good. Pretty neat.
Try to set the night on fire
- You've got some nice changes in there.
- Got any more lyrics?
Yeah, I got some. I call it Light My Fire.
If I'm gonna compete with you, it better be about earth, snakes, fire, or something.
I like it.
It sounds like the Byrds, though, man.
But I like it. It's good.
- A little Latin beat will do it justice.
- Maybe put a couple long solos over it like...
- Let's start over.
- Like Coltrane did on My Favorite Things.
- Yeah. A-minor, B-minor. It's jazz.
- Yeah, man.
The time to hesitate is through
Some kind of an intro.
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love becomes a funeral pyre
Come on baby, light my fire
Is that how it goes?
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Fire, yeah
Can you give me...
Try now we can only lose
Give me five minutes to figure an intro.
Love becomes a funeral pyre
Let him work.
- Like it?
- I like it. Let's go to the beach.
Funeral pyre.
What do you think about when you play?
I don't know.
Fish in my fish tank.
Hey, how about that acid tonight, man?
- Not for me.
- Come on.
- Not me, either.
- Right here at Ray's house.
See what kind of trouble we can get into tonight.
No way. You always get all the chicks.
I always get the dogs.
Hey, I got it! Come on!
I got it. I got the intro. Hang on a second.
John, count off from four, man.
One, two, three...
Is that horny motherfucker in the black pants here tonight?
You got no IDs, you can't get in.
- We forgot our IDs.
- Jim put us on the guest list.
The time we cried
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, yeah
Turn around, man.
Come on, let them in, Jim.
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain us
Eyes that lie
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, yeah
All right
Hey, let me see it!
Give it to me!
Made the scene
Week to week
Day to day
Hour to hour
The gate is straight
Deep and wide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Hey, hey, hey
All right
Jim. Can I have your autograph?
- I don't know. Where do you want it?
- Wherever you want.
Leave it to me. I can take you all the way.
You blew my mind out there.
Did you like the music?
Love it. That's why we're talking.
Some of it's on the dark side.
Get some tunes, like Herman's Hermits stuff.
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter
That goes right to the radio.
I'm here to groove on my boyfriend. Okay.
If you're in it, I'll break this down!
What about getting us some real equipment?
I'll sign you to a five-year contract.
Can you put that out, please?
You can smell that.
Wherever you guys want to go.
Just trust me. What do you say?
We'll have a band meeting on it.
We do everything unanimously, or we don't do it.
The musketeers. I'm touched.
Let me tell you something.
Loyalty don't pay the bills. Think about it.
You call me tomorrow, okay?
Here's my card.
Let's go.
Hey, pay attention.
You could get rich. Dig it?
Jim, how old are you?
- Twenty-one.
- Get lost, will you?
I'll make this quick and to the point.
And if you repeat it, I'll deny it.
Drop those guys.
Jim's gotta start facing the crowd if he's to be our front man.
- He's getting his confidence.
- He never does what's rehearsed.
- How does it feel?
- It feels great, but...
Your looks, your voice, that's what's gonna sell records.
We'll make a million bucks a year.
Call me. I'm right.
Do yourself a favour. Call Larry.
I like a guy who wears his soul on his face.
Whiskey's next, man.
I can feel it in my bones.
I still think the lyrics are weird.
The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was
too insane
We'll meet again
The chicks were really digging you tonight.
We still gotta deepen, man.
We gotta go one more step.
Turn around. Face the crowd.
It'll help present it better.
Gotta go to the desert and take that peyote.
- Is that what you're on?
- Yeah, man. And it's kicking in!
Fucking longhair!
- That's crazy, man.
- Come on, man.
I'm not doing acid, man.
It's peyote, John.
Hey, what's a rock and roll band for?
You gonna try it?
Let's plan a murder.
Let's start a religion. More!
I'm into TM, man. I promised my guru.
I'll try it. I'm ready. Let's go to the desert.
- Hey, who's on next?
- Love.
Yeah. Arthur Lee. He's cool.
Hey!
I am the Lizard King!
I can do anything!
Go on. Raise your hands if you understand!
Let's take a poll.
How many people know you're alive?
Bullshit!
You're plastic soldiers in a miniature dirt war.
Come on!
How many of you people know you're alive?
How many of you people know you're really alive?
Close your eyes.
You see the snake?
See the serpent appear?
His head is 10 feet long and 5 feet wide.
He has one red eye and one green eye.
That's all right. It gets better.
It's seven miles long.
Deadly.
See it? All the history of the world is on its scales.
All people, all actions.
We're all just little pictures on its scales.
God.
It's big.
It's moving.
Devouring consciousness.
Digesting power.
Monster of energy.
It's a monster.
Kiss the snake on the tongue.
Kiss the serpent.
But if it senses fear... it'll eat us instantly.
But if we kiss it without fear, it'll take us through the garden.
Through the gate. To the other side.
Ride the snake.
Till the end of time.
I think I'm fucked up, man.
I'm not thinking right.
Look at your eyes, man. You're Death.
I'm afraid of my father.
- I can't be what they want me to be.
- Maybe you should kill your father.
I'm in pain, man.
I feel the universe functioning perfectly, but I'm still perfectly locked inside myself.
Instead of oneness, I feel isolation.
But you're alive, Ray. Feel it.
I'm scared, Jim.
- It's beautiful.
- I'm still scared.
Then use us, John.
- Use our strength. Come on in here.
- God, Jim.
That's right.
We're a tribe now. A tribe of warriors.
I promise you,
I will be with you till the end of time.
Nothing will destroy our circle.
Ride the snake.
Yeah.
Come on.
My wild love went riding
She rode all the day
She rode to the devil
And asked him to pay
My wild love went riding
She went to the sea
She went to the devil
All that's left was we
I'm lying. I am afraid.
Jim! Don't go away!
Come dance with me!
Where you going, Jimmy?
Jimmy, where you going?
Lost in a Roman
wilderness of pain
And all the children
are insane
All the children
are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake
To the lake
the ancient lake, baby
The snake is long
seven miles
Ride the snake
He's old
and his skin is cold
The west is the best
Get here, and we'll do the rest
The blue bus
is calling us
The blue bus
is calling us
Driver, where you takin' us
The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived
And then he
paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, yeah
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
Father, yes son, I want to kill you
Mother
I want to
fuck you all night, baby
C'mon baby, yeah
Mother, I want to fuck you?
Come on
Fuck, fuck
Turn them off!
Turn his fucking amp off! Get him out.
Fuck me, baby, fuck, yeah
C'mon baby
Let him sing! He's a great artist!
We love him!
C'mon, yeah
Yeah, yeah
All right
Yeah
Kill, kill
- No one's gotta see this.
- Get the fuck out of here!
Kill the father, fuck the mother!
Nobody's gonna fuck their mother on my stage!
- I don't care what Elmer says. You're out.
- That's what I'm into.
Kill the father! Fuck the mother! All right.
- Jerry, come on. It's art, man!
- It's Oedipus.
Take a look at the future, old man!
We are things to come!
Here's your art! Right there!
There's your art!
This is fucking great, man!
We'll never work in this town again.
Quite a night.
Hi, I'm Jac Holzman. I own Elektra Records.
Is that asshole gonna pay us?
Listen, if you guys could put down what you did in there on record... we could have something, and make a lot of money.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Rothchild here was born to be your producer.
How you doing? Sorry about all this.
But you guys are Bertolt Brecht.
It's cabaret, it's rock and roll.
I mean, I'm really blown away, guys... and I'd love to get you guys into a studio, like, immediately.
Mr. Morrison, how'd you like to come down and go make a record?
Sure, why not?
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Bruce, you feel it? It's bitching!
Come on, baby, light my fire
An album of killer music in six days.
Six days, baby.
Unreal.
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
LBJ! LBJ!
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
All right!
Name, occupation?
Bill Siddons. I'm the manager.
I manage The Doors.
Name, occupation?
Pamela Morrison. Ornament.
Robby Krieger. Guitar player.
John Densmore. Percussionist.
22 years old. Far out, man.
Name, occupation?
Raymond Daniel Manzarek.
Born, 02-12-39. Musician. Organist.
Name, occupation?
Jim.
We're gonna be on TV. Millions of people...
Right this way, Mr. Sullivan.
They're called The Doors...
and they have the number one single in the country right now: Light Your Fire.
- Light Your Fire. Is that so?
- Yes.
Now, they're not your usual group, but I think they're gonna fit in just fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.
The riot continues in Detroit with
1,400 buildings burned and 42 people...
No wonder Light My Fire's number one.
So, what's your room number?
I'll talk to you later, okay?
You have got very serious hair.
- Were you pinching her butt?
- What about me?
I don't want to open up that kettle of worms.
What about you, handsome?
What can we do?
Some of my worst mistakes have been haircuts.
- Don't touch it, don't wash it, don't set it.
- Please. Okay. Be mean.
Boys, meet Mr. Sullivan.
Hi, fellas. Just great.
I heard your record, Light That Fire.
- Light Your Fire.
- Just really great, fine.
I have one little thing to bring up.
It's a small thing, but it's important.
The guys at network have told us they have a problem with one of your lyrics.
The lyric,
"Girl, we couldn't get much higher."
See, 'cause you can't say,
"higher" on network... so they asked if you could say instead,
"Girl, we can't get much better."
Can you dig that?
How about,
"Girl, you couldn't bite my wire"?
I don't think
Standards and Practices would...
Fellows, have a nice big smile on your face when you get out there?
There's no point in being sullen.
- Just do a fine job.
- We're a sullen group, Ed.
You boys should know, Mr. Sullivan is considering you boys for four more shows.
- You dig?
- We dig.
We dig and we'll work it out.
Give me five minutes?
- Okay. Groovy.
- All right?
- Just give me five.
- Have a great show, okay?
Well?
- Come on, John.
- It's just a word, Jim.
The Stones changed when they played here.
Why don't you change your name... to Sidney or Irving Manzarek?
It's just a word.
My words, I don't care. Let's just jam.
And now, direct from Los Angeles,
California, ladies and gentlemen...
here now, The Doors.
You know that it would be untrue
We're okay sound-wise?
It doesn't seem loud or anything?
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher, yeah
He said it. He said it on national TV.
I can't believe that!
Come on baby, light my fire
What's he doing? What's that?
Oh, Jesus! Get off! You can see his thing!
You blew it, you little shit!
You'll never play Sullivan again!
Can you just move a step forward?
Come on,
I know you love to look at yourself.
Great.
Let's try something different.
- Take your shirt off.
- You take it off.
Do you need help?
That's good.
The camera is whatever you want it to be, Jim.
A woman you want to seduce.
A man you want to kill.
It can be anything you want.
That's nice.
That's great!
Do you have any idea what these pictures can do?
One image controls millions of people.
Where are The Doors?
Right here. Will you forget The Doors?
You're the one they want.
You are The Doors. Come on.
That's good. Be ugly.
I love that. Anything you want.
There are no restrictions here.
Look at yourself. Fall in love with yourself.
You're your own audience now, Jim.
They want you.
Worship you, love you... adore you.
Jim Morrison. The God of Rock.
Not tonight, Edie, thank you.
This is the fun part of my job, because this is history in the making.
Let me put it this way.
Andy is more than an artist.
Andy Warhol is art. I think bright people in America must ask themselves:
"Does Andy imitate life, or does life imitate Andy?"
Jim. This is Tom Baker.
He's in one of Andy's movies: I, a Man.
- And this is Count Ruspoli.
- Ruspoli.
He's Italian, but he lives in Paris.
He's from a very famous family,
700 years old.
Hi, Jim.
You are great.
I see you at Ondine's with Hendrix.
So cool!
Don't you like the way he talks?
He's so cool.
- What's your trip?
- My trip? What was yours?
I caught your gig at The Scene.
I thought it was pretty good.
I liked it a lot. It was hot.
I like your movies, man.
You got a great penis.
Jim, we're gonna split.
Why don't you come with us?
- Go up to Max's to get a bite to eat.
- No, you can't leave, man.
Where's your will to be weird?
- Look, that's Jim Morrison.
- No!
- I like The Doors.
- Hey, John.
Let's get out of here, man.
- These people are wacky.
- Wacky?
Jimmy, come with me.
Andy's waiting in the bedroom for you.
No, not now. Let's do this later.
Hey, Jim.
Remember San Francisco?
- No, not really.
- What happened to that joint, man?
Check it out, man.
This chick, she sings with Andy's band,
The Velvet Underground.
She says she could drink you under the table.
Hi. I'm Nico. It's so boring tonight.
Some of us are going downtown to a new club. You want to come?
Elevate your taste in trolls, man.
Vodka?
I'll race you.
Your death.
Come on, man. Let's go.
Well, all right. We're gonna go to a club.
I met this girl, Lynne.
I think she wants to hang out with me.
Hey, don't you guys want to meet Andy Warhol?
To tell you the truth,
I could do without the guy.
- The guy's a freak.
- Come on, we got a big gig tomorrow.
Wait a minute. I thought we were gonna be a rock and roll band.
All right. The four of us.
Come on, Jim. This isn't our scene, man.
These people are vampires.
Come on, let's make the myths. Remember?
- Let's go.
- Come on, don't leave.
Come on, you guys, not tonight.
I don't know what will happen.
It might be death.
That's not death, man.
I'll see you tomorrow, bro.
Don't drink too much, man.
Jimmy, this way. Andy's waiting.
This way. I'll take you to him.
Hello, daddy.
Jimmy, please. Andy's waiting. Come on.
Hi, man. How you doing?
All right. How you doing, man?
Pretty good. Pretty neat.
Then there was this big show in Philadelphia.
- There were so many people that...
- Andy, this is Jimmy.
Jim Morrison, of the world-famous
Doors musical group.
- Andy Warhol, of course.
- Hi. Wow.
We really like your music.
- How you doing, Andy?
- Great.
And there were so many people at the show... the paintings were getting crushed... and they had to take them all down... so it really looked kind of...
- great.
- Just the walls.
You see, Andy was the art.
You should do a show with just bare walls.
We'd like to use you in one of our movies, Jim.
You're really such a beauty, and...
...someday, everybody will be famous for 15 days...
You'd really be great. Wouldn't he?
It's the singer, not the song.
It's the astronaut, not the voyage.
Or in the vernacular view, it's the trip, not the arrival.
Somebody gave me this telephone.
- I think it was Edie, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was Edie.
And she said that...
I could talk to God with it, but I don't have anything to say.
Here. This is for you.
Now, you can talk to God.
- Andy!
- Hi!
Morrison. Come here.
Darling, listen, I pay the bills, so I can choose any language that I want to.
The guy wants to talk to the bum.
Check it out, brother.
What are your songs about, Mr. Morrison?
Love. Death. Travel. Revolt.
We all write the songs.
I'm interested in... chaos, disorder... especially activities which have no meaning, like this.
On behalf of the British...
How do you feel about being called
"The ultimate Barbie doll"?
I guess when you say something like that, it's a shortcut to thinking.
And do you think about the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has gotten?
I guess they didn't understand.
- Is it true you financed its publication?
- Have you bothered to read the poetry?
You keep denying that nothing good can come out of LA.
I think that's a rather provincial attitude.
- Do you believe in drugs?
- I believe in excess.
What about alcohol? Is that considered part of the shaman's wisdom?
It's the American way. You know, we spend more money every year... on tobacco and alcohol than we do on education?
On behalf of the British press...
Where do you see The Doors five years from now?
- It's an excuse for free sex.
- What do you spend your money on?
I believe in a long, prolonged derangement of the senses... to attain the unknown.
I live in the subconscious.
Our pale reason hides the infinite from us.
Are you by any chance in a trance now, Mr. Morrison?
Do you hurt?
What?
What hurts you the most?
What do your parents think about what you're doing?
Actually, I don't remember being born.
It must have happened during one of my blackouts.
They must have expressed some feeling.
To tell you the truth, they're not living any more... so I really don't like to talk about that.
Could you at least tell us how they died?
It was a horrible car crash... in New Mexico. In the '50's.
My father ran right into a truckload of Navajos.
They were all over the highway, bleeding.
Their souls, kind of stirring in the breeze, just leapt into mine.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Krieger, do you really consider Mr. Morrison a shaman?
Don't worry about it.
It happens to other guys, too.
Wanna do some coke? It'll loosen you up.
Sure. A new thing.
How old is this?
That's 14th century.
- Witchcraft.
- Religion, you know.
Witchcraft. Witches are the protectors of the seasons.
Goddesses of the grain.
And when crossed... destroyers.
You ever try drinking blood?
What?
It works, you know.
Drink it at the right time of the moon.
They used to dance in the forests, naked.
I think that's what offended the Puritans and led to the burnings.
They were a sexual threat to their male order, like the Bacchae.
Five days a year, for Dionysus, they used to wander the hills of ancient Greece.
The first witches.
Clans of wild women... looting, fucking... eating animals raw... looking for Dionysus... to tear him to pieces!
Where do you get the blood?
Blood is the rose of a mysterious union.
Symbol of potency.
Now you.
I can't cut myself.
Don't be such a child.
If I do it, you have to do it.
You do it.
Come on, rock-god!
Fuck me! Fuck me good!
Come on, rock-god. Baby.
All right!
What do you want me to do?
What can I do, baby?
- What's the matter, baby?
- Will you die for me?
What do you want me to do?
- What do you want me to do?
- Maybe I should see a doctor or something.
What do you think, someone from the Freudian philosophy?
It happens to other guys, too.
You know, that's the irony.
Teenage death girls want my dick, not my words.
It's not so complicated.
It's just sex, you know.
I'll never wake up in a good mood again.
It's the hours and the pressure.
You do everything like it's your last performance.
We weren't built to last. You never know.
- You're setting yourself up, you know.
- You never know.
You're a poet, not a rock star.
Do you really know what I am, Pam?
- You know what poetry is?
- You don't belong on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Who am I?
Where's the feast they promised us?
Where's the new wine?
Dying on the vine.
See, I lied to you.
I love fame.
I do love fame.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- 'Cause you're in the room.
And that's gonna help?
You need to just put some soul in your success.
Suck it, mommy. Come on.
- Fuck you!
- Hey, where you going?
Where do you think you're going?
Come on. Love my girl!
How many guys have you fucked since you've been with me?
Then how many dogs have you fucked?
You're the only one who couldn't make it, you asshole.
You are the only limp dick in the lot!
Will you die for me?
- Will you die for me? Answer me!
- Will you die for me, no!
Sure. I'd die for anybody.
- Will you die for me?
- Yes.
- I don't believe you. Say it!
- Yes.
- Die for me.
- Yes.
Will you die for me? I'm just a clown.
Am I a clown?
- I need a home.
- With me.
A place to hide.
I'm sorry, baby.
We're gonna fuck death away!
Let's fuck death away.
Come on, baby. All right!
An ancient lunatic reigns in the trees of the night.
Look. Hello. We've got a serious problem up here.
The fire marshal is not going to let this concert go on...
unless you clear the aisles, and you go back to your seats.
Unless you clear these aisles, there is no show.
The sound of the crowd.
I don't even like rock groups. They're sleazy.
- Come on, now. Like Nuremberg.
- You'd like that?
- Like that?
- Like Germans.
- Beg!
- I'm begging!
- You wanna fuck me?
- Yeah.
Don't ever fucking lie to me again.
About what?
Your father. Why do you tell me bullshit, like your father's dead?
He is dead. Both of them. I told you.
If he's so dead, who answered the phone when I called?
What?
You didn't really think you were getting away with that?
Your father's an admiral in the United States Navy.
He was at the Gulf of Tonkin when the Vietnam War breaks out.
Your dads Deputy Chief of Operations.
Just don't ever lie to me again, okay?
What?
You shouldn't have done that.
Like it's so hard to trace your school records.
You went to the University of Florida.
Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Arlington, Virginia.
Washington, D.C.
You have a brother and a sister.
"Seven miles long, baby." It's all in The End.
Where the fuck is Jim?
I'm sorry.
What did he do?
Did he love you?
How much?
Your mama?
Hatreds a very underestimated emotion.
Doesn't matter any more, does it?
Do you hear them out there?
Are you listening to them?
It's you they want now.
It's not The Doors.
It's not your mother or your father's child.
It's you.
They don't want me. They want my death.
Ripped to pieces.
Patricia, just hold me.
What are you doing there?
Nothing.
Out of there. No one's allowed backstage.
- Don't you know who this is?
- It's cool. I'm with the band.
- Let's go, come on.
- Cool it, pig!
- Fucking hippie.
- Fuck you.
You motherfucker!
- They got Jim!
- I've been Maced!
What's happening here?
What the fuck is going on here?
What are you doing?
I'm blind!
- I'll issue a warrant for his arrest.
- Are you nuts?
Come on. We gotta get you on.
Leave him alone. He doesn't need more shit.
What do you know from what he needs?
Fuck! All right!
Okay! All right!
I am
yeah, back door man
Men don't know, little girls understand
Hey, all you people trying to sleep
I'm out there making midnight dream
Back door man
Men don't know, little girls understand
All right, yeah! Come on!
Late at night, babe
See that light, babe
Save us!
Jesus!
Save us!
I'll tell you something that happened a few minutes ago...
here in New Haven.
This is New Haven, isn't it?
New Haven, Connecticut,
United States of America.
Is the West really the best, or are you just stoned on weed?
Light My Fire, Jim!
Come on! Sing, Light My Fire.
I was with this girl backstage.
We wanted some privacy, so we went into this shower stall.
- We weren't doing anything, just talking.
- Yeah, right!
All of a sudden, this little man came in...
with a little blue hat and a little blue suit.
And he said, "What you doing in there?"
I said, "Nothing."
And he said,
"Well, you better get out of there, or..."
"Or what?" I said.
And he started pushing me.
So I started pushing back!
He didn't like that. Yeah.
Then he reached behind and he pulled out a little can of Mace.
And he sprayed it right in my eyes.
Fucking blinded me!
Why?
All because I was alone in a room with a girl?
Doing what he'd like to be doing if he could get it up without a gun.
All right.
In the United States of America, man.
Land of the free, home of the brave.
In God we trust!
No. Say your thing, man.
Mr. Morrison, you've gone too far.
The show's over.
You've violated state obscenity laws.
You're under arrest!
There you go.
Get out of the way, people!
Get back!
Get your hands off me, you slaves.
This isn't happening to me.
It's happening to you!
Let's just say that
I was testing the bounds of reality.
That's all, I was curious.
I kind of always preferred to be hated.
Like Erich von Stroheim in the movies.
The man you loved to hate.
It's meant to be ironic.
Like courage wants to laugh.
Essentially a stupid situation.
I go out on stage and howl for people.
In me, they see exactly what they want to see.
Some say Lizard King, whatever that means... or some black-clad leather demon, whatever that means.
But really, I think of myself... as a sensitive, intelligent human being... but with the soul of a clown that always forces me to blow it... at the most crucial moments.
I'm a fake hero.
A joke the gods played on me.
Morning. Pour me my breakfast, Dolores.
What's the matter with Jimbo?
Can't handle it?
He's pussy whipped.
Eat this, man. We got one last place to go.
- Ray's getting married today, remember?
- Alive, she cried.
I can't eat that. It'll make me sick.
Give me a Dos Equis, will you, Dolores?
And a Ramos fizz.
What happened to you last night?
You bet me $1,000... you'd walk on the ledge of the 9000 building after the gig.
Let's go right now!
Complaining about going home to your sanctuary.
We were gonna make a fucking movie.
You bet me $1,000. Give him a double.
- A triple.
- Imagine me and Morrison in a movie.
Two powerful, two Irish, two-fisted...
- drinking guys in the same movie together.
- I'll direct the shit out of it.
If Dennis Hopper can do it, I can do it.
We'll all three direct it. A real road movie.
In black and white. We'll call it "Zero."
What the fuck!
Fuck you, Morrison! Get out of here!
Fucking jackoff!
Leave the drinks.
It's only another $95,000.
But I could get the best clothes from India, from Morocco, Jim... clothes you couldn't get anywhere else.
Then we could get the richest people to come.
Miles Davis, Sonny and Cher, the Stones.
It could be the best boutique on La Cienega.
- Why don't we have a car?
- We lost it.
Yeah, but, where's the gravy train?
What's the matter with you?
What are you on?
- You said you wouldn't drink today.
- No, Ma, I ain't drinking.
You promised.
You're not gonna drink anymore, are you?
No, Ma, I ain't.
And you'll change those leathers you've been wearing for three weeks.
- I don't know about that.
- What are you on?
Some low-grade acid. It's not heavy.
Oh, God! You know I cooked!
I cooked the duck!
- Baby, it's okay.
- And people are coming.
Ray and Dorothy think that we're flaky enough... and you said we would wait until after, and now you're gonna peak before me.
No, it's cool. We'll trip and then we'll eat our feast.
Yeah, sure. No!
I think it's a good thing about Ray and Dorothy. I do, they...
Women are such noble creatures.
They carry on your name with dignity after you die.
Are you saying you want to marry me?
I think women have basically a comic approach to life.
How can they not?
They have to spend their lives... with that big dick seeking entry.
Come on, Ma, I want to look inside.
Like a spy.
I'm a spy
in the house of love
I know the dream
that you're dreaming of
I know the word
that you long to hear
I know your
deepest, secret fear
I know everything
I love it when you sing to me.
That's because
I'm the poet and you're my muse.
"Lions in the street roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
"A beast caged in the heart of the city
"Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
"Left chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder"
Here's the nuptial couple.
- What will I do about all these papers?
- Give it a drink.
You really need somebody to organise all this stuff.
Your handwriting is just like a little kid.
Look at this. I wonder if William Blake was ever this disorganised.
Honey.
- You're trying too hard.
- I'm gonna be your editor now.
Seriously, I am gonna organise all this stuff...
- and I'm gonna take out all the "fuck" words.
- You're trying too hard.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
There's some great poetry here.
There's some wonderful ideas.
Come on in.
- Hey, man.
- Hi, baby.
- Vito. How's it going?
- Yo, Ray!
- Dog, how you doing?
- There's some drinks over there.
What am I supposed to do?
Where do I fit in? Who am I supposed to be?
Darling, Pamela,
I brought you a little something.
You're my girl, that's who.
I'm not your girl.
You fuck everything that touches you.
Don't give me that shit.
Come on. I love my girl. Listen everybody!
Now, Pam and I...
She's looking good, and to celebrate...
- Patricia?
- Hi, Jim.
Pam, have you met, do you know...
She wrote this great review of my poetry book.
- Why don't we go eat that turkey?
- Come on, let's go set those plates.
- Are you Patricia Kennealy?
- You must be Pamela.
You actually put your dick in this woman?
Sometimes, yeah.
I understand. I really do.
But just don't you ever expect... that Jim's gonna love or take care of you,
'cause you're one of a hundred...
- Come on, you don't know when to stop.
- Look who's talking.
Jim can make up his own mind about who he loves and who he doesn't.
Don't kid yourself.
He's crazy, but he's not that crazy.
- He loves me.
- Let's go check on those sweet potatoes.
- Here they go again.
- It's gonna be one of those dinners.
Glad you made it.
Jim, Robby, meet Chuck Vincent.
How you doing?
I just have one more thing to say to you.
You have ruined another Thanksgiving.
Bastard! You killed my duck!
Pamela, please behave.
- Come on, Jimmy.
- We'll work it out.
It's okay.
- You want to know what murder is?
- No!
- You want a little death?
- No!
Come on. You want a little death?
Then kill me. Come on. Kill me.
Go on! Come on! Give me some death!
You killed my duck!
And I'm still killing your fucking duck!
There! Murder! Death! Duck! Dead!
Dead! Fucking dead!
There! The duck is dead!
- That's the incredible truth!
- Stop this shit.
- Will you get sane?
- Don't tell me what to do. Ever.
- Fuck off, Ray!
- Yeah, fuck off, Ray.
Fuck you, Tom.
Shit!
Fuck it. Let's eat this thing.
What happened to us, daddy?
- All right.
- There was some beautiful poetry.
- All right, honey.
- There's some beautiful poetry, daddy.
And action!
Your mother's here with your brother.
I don't want to see them, Siddons.
What do you want me to do with them?
- You hear me?
- They're waiting.
Ladies and gentlemen...
from Los Angeles, California, The Doors!
Pretty good. Pretty neat.
Not to touch the Earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but
Run, run, run, let's run
Let's run
House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze
Come on baby, run with me
Come on, honey.
I've been so lonely. I miss my girl.
Hi. I didn't realise you were entertaining.
Hello, Jimmy. I hope you're cool about this?
Don't forget your smack on the way out.
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
- Are we talking about death choices here?
- I'm doing my thing, like you said.
- Death?
- You're hurting me.
- Hurt?
- Baby.
Are you in pain?
Let me introduce you to my friend, "pain."
- Fuck you.
- Sanctuary. Looking for a place to hide?
- I'll give you a place to hide.
- From you, you pig.
Forever.
Honey, it's the best part of the trip.
Sanctuary. Come on, baby.
Come on, honey. Almost home, baby!
We're almost home, baby!
It's blinding me. Help, I'm blind!
- Come on, ride 'em, cowboy.
- Hey, look out.
- What?
- There's a cop there. Slow down.
- Where?
- Right there. In front of us.
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along, not going very far
To the east to meet the Czar
By right line, running line, crooked and straight...
I summon, stir and call you up.
By wood and stone, by wind and fire, by land and water, I bring you in.
We worship the ancient forces of nature, the Great Mother... the Triple Goddess, and the Horned One,
God of the hunt.
Death does not part, only lack of love... and the vow is forever in the Goddess's sight.
Run with me
Let's run
Some outlaws live by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl, we're almost home!
We shall see the gates by morning
We shall be inside by evening
Sun, sun, sun
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you soon!
Soon!
I am the Lizard King.
I can do anything.
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
Fucking Neanderthal prima donna's too drunk to sing.
I'm gonna love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm gonna love you
Till the stars fall from the sky
You and I
Cut.
Terrific take, Jim. We just had a bit of a technical problem here.
What's his fucking problem?
- Paul, babe.
- Yeah, right here, babe.
Why don't you suck a fart out of my asshole, you slave-driving fascist.
I hear the smokes.
- I know your fucking voice...
- Well, maybe it's because it's stale!
Come on, I wanna do my thing!
We gotta do 167 takes, until it sounds like music.
Let's do something else!
You're all a bunch of fucking slaves!
Let's do...
come on, Rock is Dead.
Everybody come out here, we'll do a sing-along like...
Oh, come all ye faithful.
It's too fucking self-conscious.
Willie, get them out. You, let's go.
You deaf? Beat it!
- Let's go!
- I'll see you later.
What are you doing?
I'm sitting in that booth for months.
I look out of the glass. I see Jim. I hear Jim.
But you know what? I miss him.
All the time, he's standing right in front of me. How do you explain that?
Don't make me go through it again.
I went through this whole shit... watching Janis dive to the bottom of a bottle of Southern Comfort.
I won't go through it again. I fucking won't!
Why are you fucking this up?
Come on baby, light my fire, fire, fire
Catchy tune.
Sold it to a commercial?
- How much?
We couldn't reach you. We figured...
What is this shit, Ray?
It's not a big deal.
The song has already been commercialised.
Feliciano's already sold two million copies.
Robby thought it was a good idea, so did John, so did I.
Where were you? You shouldve been here.
Do you know what you're saying to millions of people?
The Doors, all for one, one for all. Not real.
It's not about money... or records, or success... or these desires that you have. It's about... using the music to break through, wasn't it?
I don't know.
We lost something here.
I don't think so.
There's just a bigger picture, that's all.
In your fucking face!
What the fuck is going on, man?
Just kidding.
Hi, honey.
We were just watching a little TV.
I wanted you to find us, Jim.
It meant nothing.
You don't have to torture me.
You know, just let me make it up to you.
It's gonna be all right.
You're the one.
- Really?
- You're my girl.
You're so vulnerable about everything.
It makes me sad.
Yeah, all right, let's keep that money machine rolling.
Can you find me soft asylum?
I can't make it anymore
The man is at the door
This is the trip, the best part I really like
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number
Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way
All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave
The soft parade has now begun
Cobra on my left
Leopard on my right, yeah
Come on
And it's getting harder
Calling on the dogs when all else fails
We can whip the horse's eyes
And make them sleep and cry
I love you.
Hate your next-door neighbour
But don't forget to say grace
Tell me I'm running over and over
and over again, my friend
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
A hot night in Miami, March, '69.
Every space in the auditorium is consumed.
Unfortunately, The Doors have sold out.
They've become an act.
Morrison falls off the stage...
at least every other performance.
The Soft Parade album confirms... the plasticity of their approach.
Songs like Touch Me, and Tell All The People... are not The Doors that we once knew.
So the question is, why am I here?
Are funerals entertainment?
He's not gonna show, man. I know it.
This guy's done it to us too many times.
We should go on without him.
Bill is with him. They're an hour away.
He'll get him here, all right?
He'll be here.
There's gonna be a show here tonight... if I got to throw a wig on, man, and sing them songs myself.
No, fuck off, Cat.
Hey, dude. Jimbo! Clean up your act.
You asshole! God, I love you.
Say, listen, Paul.
- Can you get us some heroin?
- No.
- Why not? Some heroin.
- Come on, Jim.
I am not gonna participate in anything that's gonna help you accomplish your goal.
What's my goal, Paul?
Your only friend, the end
Wrong! I just wanna sing the blues, man.
Get fat, do nothing, go nowhere, just be.
With that waistline, you ain't got much choice.
What is wrong with being a large mammal?
A big beast.
Like a tank. I feel great.
You're "King Crawling Flab."
Rock is cock, baby, and your rock is dying.
Rock is death, man.
There is no longer belief.
I'll write poetry and direct movies.
No, that's bullshit, man.
Tested all the limits: fame, fucking, money.
What you gonna do when the music's over, man?
When you're too fat and old to go out on stage?
What you gonna do for Act 3?
Puke on heaven's door?
Listen, you two-bit fucking actor, you underestimate the audience.
You better face it, you're not gonna be remembered.
You think all they want... is two cars and a house.
But you're wrong.
You know what they want?
- No, tell me.
- You really want to know?
- Yeah! Tell me. What?
- Something sacred.
That's what they want. Something sacred.
- Where you been? You're two hours late.
- The seats? I took them out.
How you doing?
I'd like you to meet my new friend.
- You're not playing?
- We'll sue your fucking ass!
Sue me! You ain't playing.
See where your equipment is tomorrow morning.
I'm not going out unless I know he'll stay in line.
- I've had it with this shit!
- How will you know what couldve been?
How will you know if you can break on through?
You're a fucking asshole, Morrison!
You're pushing death, Morrison!
Everyone thinks we're drug addicts
'cause of you.
What are we, The Beatles now, John?
We took drugs to expand our mind!
Not to escape!
Listen, John.
Have you ever eaten human flesh?
'Cause I know this chick in New York, man.
- Listen, man, just one more time.
- No, man.
- For old times' sake.
- Don't want any.
For The Doors, man.
You'll play like an orgasm. Trust me.
You said you loved pain.
You run from it every chance you get.
Doors!
Doors!
Are you ready?
Fuck off!
I don't want to see any more of that shit!
Or I'll haul your ass in, pal!
Five to one, baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive, now
You get yours, baby
I'll get mine
Gonna make it, baby
If we try
The old get old
And the young get stronger
May take a week
And it may take longer
They got the guns
But we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah
We're taking over
Come on!
Look at this beautiful living thing, man.
You wouldn't eat my little friend, would you?
Come on, man. Love animals!
- Don't eat them!
- I'd fuck her but she's too young.
Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening
crawl across the year
You walk across the floor with a flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna make it, baby, in our prime
Get together one more time
You're all a bunch of fucking slaves!
How long you think it's gonna last?
How long are you gonna let them push you around? I tell you this.
I'm gonna get my kicks...
before the whole shithouse goes up in flames, all right.
- Come on, Jim!
- Light My Fire!
Fuck you, man!
Now, that's the word.
That's the very little word.
Come on, let me hear all of it.
All your little hatreds.
- Suck my dick!
- You'd all eat shit, wouldn't you?
Adolf Hitler is alive and well and living in Miami.
I fucked her last night.
What are you gonna do about it?
Come on, come on, come on, come on
And suck me, babe
Can't you see that I need some head?
What was that...
Wait a minute! Bullshit! It's fucked up, man!
It's all bullshit! It's all fucked up!
I'm coming out!
Miami Beach, Florida.
Yeah, I went to Florida State.
Then I got smart and moved to California.
Yeah, they're trying to change the world out there in California!
No, I ain't talking about no revolution!
I'm talking about having a good time this summer!
I'm talking about love your neighbour till it hurts!
Come on, how about a little nakedness?
Come on, let's see some action out there!
I'm talking about love!
I'm talking about grab your neighbour and love 'em!
Anybody gonna come up here and love my ass?
Come on! I'm lonely up here!
Come on, sweetheart. You wanna see it?
Why don't I pull it out for you?
And shake it around a little bit.
Will that do it for you?
All right, now! I'm gonna show it to you.
Don't, man!
You're a fucking Irish bum, man!
Fuck it! Come on, man! What are you doing?
Do you see it?
Yeah, I wanna see some action out there!
No limit! No laws! You wanna fuck?
Come on up here! This is your show.
Yeah! No limits! No laws!
Yeah! Fucking right, riot!
Did you see what they were at?
Where's the guy with the penis?
Where is that son of a bitch? Get back!
Fat cat in a top hat
Thinks he's an aristocrat
Dead cat in a top hat
Thinks he's an aristocrat
Sucking on a young man's blood
Wishing he could come
Sucking on a soldier's brain
Wishing it would be the same
Dead rat! Think you're an aristocrat
Crap, that's crap
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, yeah
Come on!
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
But can you still recall
The time we cried
Break on through to the other side
Mr. Morrison... you are charged with lewd behaviour on four counts:
Simulated masturbation, public drunkenness... profanity and public exposure.
How do you plead?
- Defendant pleads not guilty, Your Honour.
- Trial is set for the week...
I want to bring to this jury's attention that playing right now on Broadway...
is a musical called Hair... where the actors disrobe and appear naked on the stage.
- Objection. That's irrelevant...
- Sustained.
- Your Honour, how can you sustain that?
- Stick to the facts, Counsellor.
This is a major First Amendment violation by the politicians... and the police of Miami.
Every single witness they've brought here has testified... to not actually seeing my client's genitals... except one who is related to the arresting officer.
I tell you, if you convict on such lack of evidence...
I assure you that someday, somewhere... in the still of the night, you will wake up screaming.
Are you gonna get rid of it?
Wouldn't it be better to have a kid with someone that wanted to be its father?
Fucking genius, that's what it'd be.
You and me... the child would be a goddess or a god.
It'd be a monster.
Look, I...
I got this trial that's hanging on me, and I can't afford this.
I don't want the responsibility.
You're a coward! Just a little boy!
The only way you can't afford it is emotionally!
Those vows were forever in the Goddess's sight.
Death does not part, only lack of love.
Come on, Patricia.
I was stoned.
It seemed like a fun thing to do at the time.
Fuck you. I'm gonna have the kid.
Well, then, it will be your kid.
But if you want the abortion,
I'll be there with you.
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will.
Bullshit, Morrison, you know who you are!
What difference does it make?
You know, you never pretended.
I did.
You know, I don't even like kids particularly.
I don't want the other fucking thing, either.
You looked in the mirror lately?
- Look at that stomach.
- Come on, now.
Don't say these things.
James Douglas Morrison...
I hereby sentence you... to six months of hard labour in the Dade County Jail.
And for public exposure...
I am sentencing you to 60 days of the same... after which you are to serve two years and four months of probationary time.
Your Honour, I have an appellate bond of the sum of $50,000 here.
I ask that Mr. Morrison remain free pending his appeal.
Everywhere, Jim. Jacksonville, Dallas, even Kent State University cancelled.
The press, for the first time, turned against us.
Pamela's called six times.
Katherine, Patricia, Judy.
Gayle's pregnant, she says.
You gotta go to the dentist.
Look, Jim, go home, get some sleep, get back to your words, okay?
- And wash your hair.
- Take a bath, too, man.
- This guy despises you.
- We weren't even invited to Woodstock.
- Twenty other bands. Not us.
- First Hendrix, now Janis.
Radio stations are pulling us from their playlists.
Big cities, Philly, Cincy, Chicago, Detroit.
You can drag the appeal for years, keep you out of jail.
FBI's behind it.
They had memos on you in Phoenix.
They extradited you to Miami.
A new image.
We can bring you back slow, quiet... the beard, the elder of the tribe.
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!
The band you love to hate.
Let's win there. Thank you very much.
It was fun.
I think I'm having a nervous breakdown.
Jim! Do you hear me, Jim Morrison?
- Life on the edge, baby!
- We're rolling, Jim.
- Pretty good. Pretty neat.
- Jump!
Now I want you to come back in here this minute, Jim Morrison.
I am not gonna kill myself for you!
Goddamn it, Jim!
- Your whole life is bullshit!
- Shut up!
- lf you love me, come on out and get me!
- No!
Pam, get back inside!
Pam, don't go out there!
I want you.
Get over here, honey.
Come on, baby.
Give her your hand. She's gonna fall.
Watch it. Once more with feeling. Take two.
- I don't wanna die.
- Come on, baby.
- We got to write LA Woman and finish it.
- We don't have an ending, Ray.
"...has wolves in it."
Come on, girl.
I see your hair is burning
"The most beautiful one of all
"Dances in a ring of fire
"and throws off the challenge with a shrug"
That's my girl.
Let's go and leave this place.
Just you and me, baby.
We can, you know.
Just one more step.
No, I wanna live!
I wanna live with you!
"All the poetry has wolves in it," Pam.
"All but one
"The most beautiful one of all
"I hope you go out smiling like a child
"into the cool remnant of a dream
"The angel man
"finally claimed his benevolent soul
"Ophelia
"Leaves sodden in silk
"Chlorine dream
"Mad, stifled witness"
All right.
- Hi, Dorothy. You cut your hair.
- We're trying to have another baby.
What, was your hair getting in the way?
Listen, where's Ray? I gotta catch a plane.
He's upstairs.
- Okay, and where's Princess?
- Out back.
We added a rain effect to Riders, man.
It's great.
It's the best album since Days, man.
I must admit, pretty good for four guys... who weren't even talking to each other that day.
So you're really gonna live in Paris, man?
Yeah, you know, be anonymous.
Write a book.
"Observations of an American
While on Trial in Miami."
Still got a lot of good songs in you, man.
Still think we got a couple of blues albums in us.
I'm pinned, man.
They got a category for everything we do.
I'm a wanted man.
I'm gonna miss you, man.
I'm gonna miss that feeling of playing music with you, man.
You, John, miss me?
More than you think, asshole.
You can always whip the horse's eyes.
As far as I'm concerned,
I made music with Dionysus.
We had moments on stage that no one'll ever fucking know.
Now, you lay off those drugs, Robby.
Merry Christmas.
We'll get together again, you know.
Some strange way.
Maybe we'll make a movie together.
Black and white.
- Sabrina, this one's for you.
- Thank you.
- See you around.
- What, no bon voyage?
I'll see you back.
And, little Princess Smiling Face, this one's for you... from Chief Mojo Rising.
Happy Birthday, Princess.
- Let me see.
- It's you.
Forever young.
This is the strangest life I've ever known.
Jim, got a plane to catch, man?
Yeah.
We're reaching for death
On the end of a candle
We're trying for something
That's already found us
Last Words. Out.
Did you get all that?
Yeah. I got it, Jim.
Come on. Let's get some tacos.
Death.
It's not so bad. Love my girl.
Jim, is that you?
I knew it was you, Jim Morrison.
I always know when it's you.
Come on, baby, get out of the tub.
Mama'll dry you off.
You stop joking around, now, you hear me? Just cut it out.
Was it all right, Jim?
Did you enjoy it when it came?
Just like you said you would.
They are waiting to take us
Into the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death
On a strange hour unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you've brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings
Where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws
No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until its other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a Feast of Friends to the Giant Family
Well, I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
It is my sad duty to inform you that Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the nation, entered immortality at 8:25 this evening.
- You are not welcome here.
- He was the father of my children too.
They have a right to see him, to pay their last respects.
You are not his wife.
Your children are bastards.
No, no! He's my papa!
Oh what a circus
Oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress
Called Eva Perón
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all
Of the misery right
Oh what an exit
That's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried
Like Eva Perón
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country ln a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all
The world's papers today
But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?
She had her moments
She had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada
Crying, "Eva Perón"
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see, and how
She did nothing for years
You let down your people, Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted
Not much to ask for
But in the end you
Could not deliver
Sing, you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead
Your king is through
She's not coming back to you
Show business kept us all alive
Since 1 7 October 1 945
But the star has gone
The glamour's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in
Instead of government, we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help, we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud
Don't cry for me, Argentina
For I am ordinary
Unimportant
And undeserving
Of such attention
Unless we all are
I think we all are
So share my glory
So share my coffin
It's our funeral too
Senor Magaldi?
It's seven o' clock. You'll be late.
Now, Eva Perón
Had every disadvantage
You need if you're going to succeed
No money, no cash
No father, no bright lights
There was nowhere she'd been
At the age of 1 5
As this tango singer found out
Agustin Magaldi
Who has the distinction of being the first
Man to be of use
To Eva Duarte
On this night of 1 000 stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays forever more
In the glow of those twinkling lights
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million nights
Fly away with me
I never dreamed that a kiss could be as sweet as this
Now I know that it can
I used to wander alone without a love of my own
I was a desperate man
But all my grief disappeared
And all the sorrow I'd feared wasn't there any more
On that magical day
When you first came my way, miamor
To think that a man as famous as you are
Could love a poor little nothing like me
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Just listen to that
They're onto you, Magaldi
I'd get out while you can
It's happened at last
I'm starting to get started
I'm moving out with my man
Now, Eva, don't get carried away
Monotony passed, suburbia departed
Who could ever be fond of the back of beyond
Don't hear words that I didn't say
What's that?
You desert the girl you love?
The girl I love?
What are you talking about?
She really brightened up your out of town engagement
She gave you all she had
She wasn't in your contract
You must be quite relieved
That no one's told the papers
So far
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Would I have done
What I did
If I hadn't thought
If I hadn't known
We would stay together?
Seems to me there's no point in resisting
She's made up her mind, you've no choice
Why don't you be the man who discovered her?
You'll never be remembered for your voice
The city can be paradise
For those who have the cash
The class and the connections
What you need to make a splash
The likes of you get swept up
In the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class...
Screw the middle classes
I will never accept them
My father's other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight
Hidden from view at his funeral
Do all your one night stands
Give you this trouble?
Eva, beware of the city
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled
It is mad
Those who are fools are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become
What they should not become
Changed, in short they go bad
Bad is good for me
I'm bored, so clean and so ignored
I've only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here
So why, oh why, oh why the hell can't l?
I only want variety of society
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Five years from now I shall come back
And finally say
You have your way
Come to town
But you'll look at me with a foreigner's eyes
The magical city
A younger girl's city
A fantasy long since put down
All you've done to me
Was that a young girl's fantasy?
I played your city games all right, didn't l?
I already know what cooks
How the dirty city feels and looks
I tasted it last night, didn't l?
Eva, beware your ambition
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled, will run wild
This in a man is danger enough
But you are a woman
Not even a woman
Not very much more than a child
And whatever you say
I'll not steal you away
What's new, Buenos Aires?
I'm new
I want to say I'm just a little stuck on you
You'll be on me too
I get out here, Buenos Aires
Stand back
You oughta know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
Fill me up with your heat
With your noise, with your dirt, overdo me
Let me dance to your beat
Make it loud, let it hurt, run it through me
Don't hold back
You are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying
Get this! Just look at me
Dressed up somewhere to go
We'll put on a show
Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood
Wine me up with your nights
Watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing
Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
And
If ever I go to far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town
I love you
And
If I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown
And silence
You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death
You are shoddy
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying
Rio de la Plata
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio
All I want to know
I don't expect my love affairs
To last for long
Never fool myself
That my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble
I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it
Wouldn't you?
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
Take your picture off another wall
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by, you always have before
Time and time again
I've said that
I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom
That I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters
All my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me
And they do
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
Take your picture off another wall
You'll get by you always have before
Where am I going to?
Call in three months time
And I'll be fine
I know
Well, maybe not that fine
But I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places
Of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation
Here and now
Where am I going to?
Don't ask any more
Good night and thank you, whoever
She's in every magazine
Been photographed, seen
She is known
We don't like to rush but your case has been packed
If she's missed anything you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves
Which means...!
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been and never will be a lover, male or female
Who hasn't an eye on
In fact they rely on tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them
You're the same
Good night and thank you, Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book on the way out the door
And that will be all lf she needs you, she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But when we were hot we were hot
I know you'll look back on the good times we shared
Which means...!
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn't an eye on ln fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame her
You're the same
There is no soap
No soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion or oil
With such power
In the shower
It's the mother and father
Of luxury lather
The talk of the bath
The great ointment
One little frolic
With new Zaz carbolic
You're scented
You'll be sent
Good night and thank you, Senor Jabón
We are grateful
You found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way
So do up your trousers and go
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive
Which means...!
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes
Is all very well, but every girl knows
She needs a man she can monopolise
With fingers in dozens of different pies
In June of '43
There was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called
The G.O.U.
Who did not feel
The need to be elected
They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Attila the Hun
A bomb or two
And very few objected
Just one shell
And governments fall like flies
Ka-pow, die
They stumble and fall
Bye-bye
Backs to the wall
Aim high
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet ruled
As democracy died
The lady's got potential
She was setting her sights
On making it in movies with her name in lights
The greatest social climber since Cinderella
OK, she couldn't act
But she had the right friends
And we all know a career depends
On knowing the right fella
To be stellar
Just one shell
And governments lose their nerve
That's how we get
The government we deserve
Now, the man behind the president calling the shots
Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Perón
Would-be dictator
He began in the army out in ltaly so
Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row
And reckoned he'd do likewise
Sooner or later
Just one blast
And the tear gas falls like rain
They haven't a chance
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands
Perón was biding time out
In the slow lane
Suddenly an earthquake hit
The town of San Juan
They stumble and fall
Keep away from the wall
But one guy
Was having a ball
The tragedy a golden chance for Perón
He organised a concert
With incredible flair
In aid of all the victims
Such a grand affair
Politicians, actors
Stars of every flavour
It was January 22, 1 944
A night to remember, that's for sure
For that's the night
That Perón first met Eva
On this night
On this night
On this night of 1 000 stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays for evermore
Your act hasn't changed much
Neither has yours
I stand here as a servant of the people
As we come together for a marvellous cause
You've shown by your presence
Your deeds and applause
What the people can do
True power is yours
Not the government's
Unless it represents
The people
One always picks
The easy fight
One praises fools
One smothers light
One shifts
From left to right
Politics
The art of the possible
I've heard so much about you
I'm amazed
- For I'm only an actress
- For I'm only a soldier
- Nothing to shout about
- One of the thousands
- Only a girl on the air
- Defending the country he loves
But when you act
The things you do affect us all
But when you act
You take us away from the squalor of the real world
- Are you here on your own?
- Yes. Oh yes
So am I
What a fortunate coincidence
Maybe you're my reward
For my efforts here tonight
It seems crazy
But you must believe
There's nothing calculated
Nothing planned
Please forgive me
If I seem naive
I would never want to force your hand
But please understand I'd be good for you
I don't always rush in like this
20 seconds after saying hello
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so
But you really should know
I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you
I won't go on if I'm boring you
But do you understand my point of view
Do you like what you hear
What you see
And would you be
Good for me too?
I'm not talking of a hurried night
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason that I caught your eye
Which has to imply I'd be good for you
Please go on. You enthral me
I can understand you perfectly
And I like what I hear, what I see
And knowing me
I would be good for you too
I'm not talking
Of a hurried night
A frantic tumble
Then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason
That I caught your eye
Which has to imply I'd be good for you
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn't an eye on ln fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same
Hello and goodbye
I've just unemployed you
You can go back to school
You've had a good run
I'm sure he enjoyed you
Don't act sad or surprised
Let's be friends, civilised
Come on, little one
Don't sit there like a dummy
The day you knew would arrive is here
You'll survive
So move, funny face
I like your conversation
You've a catchy turn of phrase
You're obviously going through
Some adolescent phase
So what happens now?
Where am I going to?
You'll get by, you always have before
Don't ask any more
At the watering-holes
Of the well-to-do
I detect a resistance to
Precisely
Our heroine's style
We're glad you noticed
The shooting sticks
Of the upper class
Give her an inch...
Aren't supporting a single ass
That would rise for the girl
...She'll take a mile
Such a shame she wandered
Into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person
Has forced us to be blunt
No, we wouldn't mind
Seeing her at Harrods
But behind the jewellery counter
Not in front
Could there be
In our fighting corps
A lack of enthusiasm for
Perón's latest flame?
You said it, brother
Should you wish
To cause great distress
In the tidiest officer's mess
Just mention her name
That isn't funny
Perón is a fool, breaking every taboo
Installing the girl in the army H.Q.
And she's an actress, the last straw
Her only good parts
Are between her thighs
She should stare at the ceiling
Not reach for the skies
Or she could be his last whore
The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it's her that's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Dangerous Jade
We have allowed ourselves to slip
We have completely lost our grip
We have declined to an all-time low
Tarts have become the set to know
I'm only a radio star with just one weekly show
But speaking as one of the people
I want you to know
We are tired of
The decline of Argentina
With no sign of
A government able to give us the things we deserve
It's no crime for officers to do as they please
As long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease
We ignore, we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the centre where she's not qualified
We are forced to mark his card
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud, but to be laid
Slut
Dangerous Jade
This has really been your year
Miss Duarte
Tell us where you go from here
Miss Duarte
Which are the roles that you yearn to play?
Whom did you sleep...dine with yesterday?
Acting is limiting
The lines not mine
That's no help to the Argentine
Can we assume then that you'll quit?
Is this because of your involvement
With Colonel Perón?
She won't be kept happy by her nights on the tiles
She says it's his body
But she's after his files
So get back onto the street
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud, but to be laid
The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it's her that's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Things have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower class
Graceless and vulgar, uninspired
Can be accepted and admired
Dice are rolling
The knives are out
Would-be presidents are all around
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground
It doesn't matter
What those morons say
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
There's only 20 of them anyway
What is 20 next to millions who
Are looking to you?
All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody's way
We'll... You'll be handed power
On a plate
When the ones who matter
Have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree
To be called
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we're ahead
For distance lends enchantment
And that is why
All exiles
Are distinguished
More important, they're not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide
There's no risk
There's no call for any action at all
When you have unions on your side
A new Argentina
The chains of the masses untied
The voice of the people
Cannot be denied
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems
He shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
A new Argentina
The workers' battle song
The voice of the people
Rings out loud and long
Now, I am a worker
I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed
And I've starved, and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Perón
May the nation let him save them
As he saved me
A new age about to begin
We face the world together
And no dissent within
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace
Taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing
It's attractive
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep
Momentum, if it's you that you are following
Don't close doors
Keep an escape clause
Because we might lose
The Big Apple
But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought
If I hadn't known
We would take the country?
Perón has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
Release him.
I was Flint's first mate that voyage... three days east of Tortola in the Caribie.
Flint knew an island.
That's where we buried the treasure.
Gold and blood, they were Flint's trademarks.
He'd leave both behind him that day.
Shiver my timbers
Shiver my soul
Yo ho, heave ho
There are men whose hearts
are as black as coal
Yo ho, heave ho
And they sailed their ship
'cross the ocean blue
A bloodthirsty captain
and a cutthroat crew
It's as dark a tale
as was ever told
Of the lust for treasure
and the love of gold
Shiver my timbers
Shiver my sides
Yo ho, heave ho
There are hungers as strong
as the winds and tides
Yo ho, heave ho
And those buccaneers
drown their sins in rum
The devil himself would
have to call them scum
Every man aboard would have
killed his mate
For a bag of guineas
or a piece of eight
A piece of eight
-A piece of eight
-A five, six, seven, eight
Hulla wacka, ulla wacka
Something not right
Many wicked icky things
gonna happen tonight
Hulla wacka, moolah wacka
Sailor man beware
When de money in de ground
Dere's murder in de air
Murder in the air
One more time now.
Shiver my timbers
Shiver my bones
Yo ho, heave ho
There are secrets that sleep
with old Davy Jones
Yo ho, heave ho
When the mainsail's set
and the anchor's weighed
There's no turning back
from any course that's laid
And when greed and villainy
sail the sea
You can bet your boots
there'll be treachery
Shiver my timbers
Shiver my sails
Dead men tell no tales
Oh, aye. Fifteen men went ashore that day... and only Flint, his own self, returned.
Oh, aye, and then old Flinty... up and died afore they could get back to that cursed island... and dig up the treasure.
No one knows to this day who has old Flint's map.
Now, isn't that a story worth the hearing?
It was the first dozen times we heard it.
I'll drink to that.
But who has the map now, huh?
Some black-hearted, squid-suckin' buccaneer?
Or maybe it's our very own Jim Hawkins.
Eh,Jimmy?
If I had it, my friends and I wouldn't be here serving you rum, Mr Bones.
That's right. We'd be out searching for that treasure... sailing the seven seas on a five-year mission... boldly going where no man has gone before.
- Say, that's catchy.
- Huh. Not me.
If I had that treasure map,
I'd be tradin' it for a decent meal.
Hey, Gonzo, you think he's gonna eat this?
Aye! Beware the one-legged man!
He's the one to fear!
Don't worry, Captain.
We'll watch for him.
Yeah, I'll watch for him, if he's deliverin' a pizza.
Even old Flinty feared him.
If he comes pokin' 'round here, you run for me whippety-quick!
- If we see him, we'll tell you.
- Yeah. One leg, three heads... couple of dozen noses-- if anything weird happens--
And it'll be nay jokin' matter, hose nose.
The one-legged man brings death.
Time, gentlemen!
It's closing time!
Ya pays your bills, and then ya shove off.
Go on. Out ya go!
Oh, you're drunk again, are ya?
Boys, look at the state of this place!
How comes it gets to be such a pigsty, huh?
Pigsty? Hey!
No offence meant, gentlemen, sirs.
No offence meant.
- Here's to you, boys!
- Time!
- I'm away to my room.
- Thank you, Mr Bones.
- Thank you, Bill.
- There you go!
Don't forget to come back tomorrow for our lunchtime special:
- roast suckling--
- Huh?
- Potatoes, sir. Potatoes.
- All right.
No-- No offence, madam.
No offence.
All right, boys.
When you're finished here, you can go and clean up in the kitchen.
I left some table scraps in there for your supper.
Oh, yes, and, boys... last night you forgot to put out the lantern!
If you forget that again, there'll be no table scraps for a week!
You're standing on my ear.
Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, Rizzo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's it. Steady.
- I hate my life.
- I hate your life too.
- If I had a life, I'd hate it.
- I should just run off to sea
He was my age when he sailed to China as a cabin boy
Run off to sea and just leave everybody?
Who's everybody?
I'm an orphan. I've got no family.
- Hey, you got us!
- Yeah, we're family. Got it.
I mean, some family we are. Be serious,
Rizzo. We don't exactly look alike.
Okay, all right. So I'm a rat and you're a human being and Gonzo's a, uh--
- Whatever.
- Yeah. We're still family.
- Yeah.
- But I wish my life were more like... one of Captain Bones' adventures... sailing the high seas and searching for buried treasure.
Yeah, discovering lost islands and weird civilizations.
Navigating with my father's old compass to wherever the wind may take us.
- Off to Zanzibar to meet the Zanzibarbarians.
To the southwest, pirate galleons!
To the southeast, multi-armed
Zanzibanian shark women... and their exploding wigs of death!
To the northwest, dirty dishes!
How does she do that?
- Might as well start. I'll wash.
- Oh, yeah. I'll dry.
I'll break.
I look around here
and I want to cry
Me too. Yeah.
I feel like the world
is passing me by
It is.
And I just can't
help but wonder
Am I doomed to wash and dry
And is it a curse I'm under
to do it till I die
- Oh, I hope not.
- Yeah.
- When I could be an explorer
- Sure ya could.
- Sailing off to distant lands
- Not so fast.
Instead of spending
every afternoon
Just getting dishpan hands
My future looks like nowhere
that I want to be
There's gotta be
something better
Something better
There's gotta be something
better than this for me
Well, now you're talkin'.
If it's weird and wild
let's go and find it
The crazier, the better
is what I say
Yeah, that's true.
To tell the truth
I really wouldn't mind it
Mind what?
If we found someplace
with ten square meals a day
Let danger call my name
If it does
I'm gonna hide
I'll put my courage
to the test
And I'll be
by your side
He'll be by your side
There's gotta be
something better than this
- Something more than this
- I know that there's so much out there
- To see
- To see
And I know
this life I'm living
Can't be my destiny
There's gotta be
something better
Something better
There's gotta be something
better than this for me
- And me!
- Wait a minute. What about me?
There's something better
than this for you and
Me
Enough of this singin'!
Rum! I need rum, lads!
I got the horrors!
Give me rum!
Rum till I float!
All right! All right!
Just one small one.
Don't be giving him any more rum!
How does she blooming do that?
Shh! Shh!
Billy Bones!
It's me, Blind Pew.
I know you're here, Billy.
Ya snivelling coward!
It's some kind of a blind fiend.
I believe they prefer
''visually challenged fiend.''
Ah, I heard that!
There's someone here!
Uh, no. Over here!
Hmm, over here.
Billy Bones! Ah,
I'd know that scurvy mug... of yours anywhere.
Excuse me, sir, but the bar is closed.
Aha. A pretty little girl, is it?
Yes. Take me to Billy Bones, my pet.
Y-You've come to the wrong place.
Th-There's no Billy Bones here, and I'm not a girl.
Oh, I may be visually challenged, but I can see you're lying.
Huh?
Good evening, Bill.
I know it's you.
Yes. You thought you could get away with it, didn't you?
Just take it all for yourself... and leave your shipmates with nothing.
We're not pleased with that,
Bill. Not at all.
We want you to have this!
Watch where you're going, you stupid cat!
The Black Spot!
But I don't understand.
What is the Black Spot?
The Black Spot's a pirate's death sentence!
- Fabulous.
- They'll be comin' to kill me tonight!
- We'd better help.
- Yeah, yeah, let's get some stuff.
- It's my sea chest them lubbers want.
- Underwear.
But I'll trick them! I'll shake out another reef and daddle 'em again!
You wanna run that by us again in English, Mr Bones?
It's mine! I'm goin' for that treasure myself!
And no one-legged son of a bilge rat will--
Captain Bones!
He died? And this is supposed to be a kids' movie.
Jimmy.Jim.
Jimmy,Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.
You always been a decent sort to old Billy Bones.
But I'm not Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.
He's Jimmy,Jim,Jimmy,
Jim,Jim,Jim,Jim.
-Jim!
- Yes, Captain.
Jim,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jim,
Jim,Jim,Jim.
- Yes, Captain. What is it?
- Take the map!
- What map?
- The map to old Flint's treasure!
Don't ya understand what I been tellin' ya?
I was Flinty's first mate!
We all were! Blind Pew and me!
Me own shipmates, they'll gully me for sure!
And anybody else to get their mitts on that map!
A-And gullying hurts, right?
Oh, aye! A lot!
- So quick.
- Go to my sea chest! Get the map!
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, there. There.
- Oh, I think I've-- Oh, no.
- Hey, guys, look!
- Rizzo!
Oh, here!
How about this?
Let's see.
Hey, Rizzo, look.
- It is a treasure map.
- We're gonna be rich.
- We're gonna be dead.
- Beware, lads!
Beware!
- What? The one-legged man?
- Aye! But also... beware runnin' with scissors or any other pointy objects.
It's all good fun till somebody loses an--
Captain?
We're standing in a room with a dead guy!
Jim!
Oh, Billy Bones!
Trick or treat!
Don't try to hide, Billy!
You know what we want!
Where are ya, Billy Bones?
Where are ya, Billy?
Mrs Bluveridge!
There's no use in hiding!
Can't a woman get her beauty sleep any more?
Jim, what you doing?
Aha! Aha!
Oh! Voila!
- Okay, okay. I found the gun.
- Oh, now we gotta load it.
- Okay.
- Oops.
Okay, where does Mrs Bluveridge keep the bullets?
Billy's dead, and he hasn't got the blooming map!
- Those little girls must have it.
- Yeah!
- Get them!
- Yeah!
- Gonzo! Gonzo!
- What? What?
I found the bullets. See?
Here they are. They--
Oops.
Open up in there!
We wants the map... and we'll skewer anybody who gets in the way!
Quick,Jim! The back stairs!
Come on.
Run! Run!
Get out of my inn, you tattooed miseries!
Can't a woman get a night's sleep alone?
You come here, you!
This gun is useless!
- You lost all the bullets!
- Well, you're losin' the powder.
The map!
Tell us where it is or die!
- Get them!
- Run! Run, run, run!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry!
Outta the way! Outta the way!
Get outta the way!
Stop!
Oh, Woof.
Geronimo!
Guys!
Wow! What an exit!
- Right through a brick wall!
- I am in such pain.
Come on!
I think I smell something burning, no?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
We can't go home, so--
Oh, no. Uh-uh. No way. You're not taking me on some crazy treasure hunt.
- I am staying right here!
- Oh, good idea, Rizzo.
Then you can see what half-burned, vicious pirates look like.
What are we waitin' for?
Gimme that map. Come on. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
What about Mrs Bluveridge?
I'll be fine, boys!
Run for it!
How does she do that?
Who's gonna clean all this up?
Two for a penny, sir?
- I don't want a baked potato.
- Lovely hot baked potatoes.
- Oh, let's see.
- What a night.
- There it is!
- Huh? Oh.
''Trelawny & Son
Master Ship Builders''
Whoa, whoa!
Reality check here, guys!
Do we actually believe some bozo's gonna give us a ship... just because we show him
Captain Bones' map?
- It's worth a try, Rizzo.
- I don't know.
May I help you?
Yes. Thank you. We wish to speak with Squire Trelawney, the shipbuilder.
- We need a ship.
- Ah, I'm sorry.
The squire's in Long Neddry for the grouse season.
He will return on the feast of St Lulu.
- Thank you.
- That's that.
Of course, his rich... half-wit son young Squire Trelawney's here.
We'll see him, then.
Well, gentlemen... this is definitely a genuine, bona fide treasure map.
Really!
Yes. Mr Bimbo told me so.
Oh, Mr Bimbo lives in my finger.
He's very smart. He's been to the moon.
Thank you. Twice.
- I smell a bozo.
- Mm-hmm.
Well done, Beakie.
Now we know that is definitely too much gunpowder.
Beaker, stop fooling around.
We've got company.
Oh, hello, chappies. Everyone, this is
Dr Livesey and his assistant, Beaker.
They do research and development for my papa.
Hello.
Actually, Squire, we were hoping to meet your father.
- We need a ship for an ocean voyage.
- Ocean? Ocean.
- Ocean?
- You know, the ocean?
Oh! Th-The big, blue, wet thing! Yes!
Say, I know what's happening here.
You chaps are planning to sail to this island, aren't you?
- To dig up this treasure.
- Yes, but we must be quiet about it.
- There are pirates looking for this map.
Isn't that exciting?
Pirates, eh?
Well, that settles it.
We'll use one of my daddy's boats... and I will personally finance the voyage for the treasure myself.
- You'll do that? Really?
- What are rich, half-wit sons for?
Well, here's the dock.
Jim, where's our boat?
We're on a dock?
No wonder I'm seasick.
- Ahoy!
- Ah, morning, Squire.
Welcome. Welcome.
Ah, there she is: the Hispaniola.
Wow!
- Come on. Let's go!
- Yeah, let's go.
- ''Take a cruise,'' you said.
- Huh?
- ''See the world,'' you said.
- Huh?
Now here we are stuck on the front of this stupid ship.
Well, it could be worse.
We could be stuck in the audience.
Well, Mr Bimbo... the ship is provisioned, the crew is in place... and the captain should be on board within the hour.
You have been a busy little man.
- Oh, look, there goes Jim.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Ooh! Ooh, look!
It's the boat steering thing.
This is called the helm.
Hey, how does it feel,
Captain Hawkins?
Feels like we're really doing it.
It feels like we're finally having an adventure!
Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Where's the kitchen?
Heigh ho and up she rises
- Something smells good.
- Heigh ho and up she rises
- Cool.
- Heigh ho and up she rises
Early in the morning
Put him in the longboat
until he's sober
Put him in the longboat
till he's sober
Put him in the longboat
till he's sober
Early in the morning
What have we here?
Stowaways!
I'm afraid we shish-kebab and barbecue stowaways on this ship.
Wait. I know.
You must be the cabin boys.
- Yeah.
- Hungry, lads?
Well, in my galley, you're always welcome to help yourselves!
Yes! Thank you!
Oh, yes!
Well, he's got a healthy appetite.
How about you, funny face?
- Huh?
- Here.
Hey. Thank you.
My name is Gonzo, and the guy in your chicken is Rizzo.
- And you must be Master Hawkins.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, you needn't be callin' a lowly ship's cook ''sir.''
Long John Silver, at your humble service.
We're just cabin boys,
Mr Silver.
Long John to his friends.
And believe me, lad... a friend you can trust is worth his weight in gold.
There's many a dark-hearted scoundrel in these ports.
Well, what do you mean?
Pirates?
- Shh!
- Pirates! That's rich!
Pirates? What an imagination.
Give me a cracker.
Allow me to introduce my pet lobster Polly.
Pieces of eight!
Pieces of eight!
Raised him from a fingerling, I did.
As fine a crustacean as a man could ask for.
B-But I thought sailors had talking parrots as pets.
Talking parrots?
What an imagination.
First pirates, now talking parrots?
What's next? A singing, dancing mouse with his own amusement park?
That's enough now, Polly.
Go on! Shoo!
Right, me hearties. I'm gonna give you a cook's tour of this fine ship.
If you're gonna be the cook on this ship, Mr Silver...
I am definitely gonna need bigger pants.
What's the matter, lads?
Oh, that?
Lost that timber-fighting brigands off Madagascar under Admiral Hawke.
There's many a man lost a leg and worse in the service of the king.
Why, look what a cannibal took off me... in exchange for me own life.
Oh, you're a fine pair, lads.
That you are.
Bright as buttons, the lot of ye.
- All hands on deck!
- Come on, then, lads.
Chop-chop! Look lively now.
The captain will be here soon.
Chop-chop.
- Who's that?
- That is Mr Arrow, the first mate,
The captain approaches.
Move aside! Make way!
Make ready for the captain!
Lollygaggers will suffer his wrath!
Wrath? I-Is this captain bad-tempered?
Is he bad-tempered?
The man is a raging volcano... tormented by inner demons the likes of which mere mortals cannot fathom.
He's got demons? Cool!
Maniac!
Heigh-ho, everyone.
- What-- That--
- That's the raging volcano?
- He's a frog.
- Maybe he gets hopping mad.
Hopping mad.
Piping aboard
Captain Abraham Smollett.
Good day, Mr Arrow.
I knew it.
He's furious.
- Ah, you there!
- Me?
You were in charge of railing dust.
Thirty lashes, and then
- I didn't say that, Mr Arrow.
- I was anticipating your whim, sir.
Oh. You must be the cabin boys.
- Yes, sir!
- Which one of you is Hawkins?
I am, sir.
I knew your father,Jim.
He was a good man.
Thank you, sir.
Well, this is shapin' up to be a fine voyage, lads.
Oh, yes, indeed.
One leg,Jim.
Count 'em. One.
- Remember what Billy Bones said.
- Oh, Gonzo, he seems all right.
I mean, Long John's only a cook.
How dangerous could he be?
Well, I don't know, but I--
Wait a minute. Where's Rizzo?
Enjoy your cruise, sir.
Next!
All right, folks, have your cheques made out to ''Rat Tours Limited.''
Remember, we put the rat in ''pirate.''
Why, thank you,
Mr Plagueman. Next!
- Rizzo, what are you doing?
- What? Oh, this.
Well, I figure if the treasure map's a dud... the trip won't be a total loss, financially speaking.
Well, the wind seems to be freshening.
The tide is with us.
Mr Arrow, this voyage has begun.
This voyage has begun!
Raise the gangplank!
- Right, lads!
- Let go forward line!
Let go aft line.
Hard to starboard.
Any man caught dawdling will be shot on sight.
- I didn't say that.
- I was just paraphrasing.
- Mr Arrow, just set the sails.
- Set the sails!
Hey, where's my camera?
- I'll miss you! I said I'll miss you!
- We'll send postcards!
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
When the course is laid
and the anchor's weighed
A sailor's blood
begins racing
With our hearts unbound
and our flag unfurled
We're underway and off
to see the world
Underway and off
to see the world
Heave ho, we'll go
Anywhere the wind
is blowing
Manly men are we
Sailing for adventure
on the deep blue sea
Safely now, Mr Silver. Let's not get sloppy just because we're singing.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Danger walks on deck
We laugh at the perils
we're facing
Every storm we ride
is its own reward
And people die
by fallin'overboard
People die
by falling overboard
Heigh ho, we'll go
Anywhere the wind
is blowing
Hoist the sails and sing
Sailing for adventure
on the big, blue, wet thing
I love to see 'em cry
when they walk the plank
I prefer to cut a throat
I love to hang 'em high
and watch their little feet
Try to walk in the air
while their faces turn blue
Just kidding.
It's a good life on a boat
There are distant lands
with burning sands
That call across the oceans
There are bingo games
every fun-filled day
And margaritas
at the midnight buffet
Margaritas
at the midnight buffet
Heigh ho, we'll go
Anywhere the wind
is blowing
Should have took a train
Sailing for adventure
on the bounding main
The salty breezes whisper
Who knows what lies ahead
I just know
I was born to lead
The life my father led
The stars will be
our compass
Wherever we may roam
And our mates
will always be
Just like a family
And though we may
put into port
The sea is always home
All right, Mr Bimbo. I didn't know you had such a good singing voice.
We'll chase our dreams
standing on our own
Over the horizon
to the great unknown
Heigh ho, we'll go
Anywhere the wind
is blowing
Bold and brave and free
- Sailing for adventure
- It's so nauseating!
- Sailing for adventure
- So exhilarating!
- Sailing for adventure
- We're all celebrating!
On the deep blue sea
Ahoy!
Roll call!
- Long John Silver?
- Aye, aye, sir!
- Short Stack Stevens?
- Aye!
- One-Eyed Jack?
- Aye!
- Black-Eyed Pea.
- Yeah.
- Walleyed Pike.
- Aye.
Polly Lobster.
- Mad Monty.
- Aye.
- Sweetums.
- Aye.
- Old Tom.
- Aye, aye.
- Real Old Tom.
- Aye.
- Dead Tom?
- Aye, aye.
Cool.
- Clueless Morgan?
- Huh?
Headless Bill.
Headless Bill.
Big-Fat-Ugly-Bug-Face-
Baby-Eating O'Brien?
Aye.
- Angel Marie.
- Aye, aye.
Gentlemen, may I see you in my cabin?
- Immediately?
- Mm-hmm.
Who hired this crew? This is undoubtedly the seediest bunch... of cutthroats, villains and scoundrels I have ever seen!
So who hired 'em?
Your finger hired the crew?
No, that's silly. The man who lives in my finger hired the crew: Mr Bimbo.
What? Ah!
Yeah, he relied heavily on the advice of our excellent cook, Long John Silver.
A cook? And a guy who lives in a bear's finger?
Exactly!
I'm starting to worry about this voyage.
Jim, I know Billy Bones gave you the treasure map... but I hope you'll give it to me for safekeeping.
I'll be careful with it, sir.
Beggin' your pardon, gentlemen... but I've come with a bit of a treat for you.
'Tis my very own best brandy... laid down by the brothers of Buckfast Abbey... vintage 1 737... to toast to a prosperous voyage.
- Oh, spiffy.
- I'm sorry, Mr Silver, but I'm not... going to allow drinking on this voyage.
- Oh, well, rules are rules.
- Oh, but, sir...
'tis a tradition for the officers to toast to the success of a voyage.
Ah, very true.
No, we must set an example for this questionable crew.
There will be no consumption of alcohol of any kind.
Oh, sir, but I can vouch for this crew myself.
You could sail to heaven and back with these men.
Well, I'm afraid
I must disagree with you.
Oh.
You wanna knock it off with the booze?
It's peeling the paint off of the shuffleboard court.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
And that's that.
This conversation is finished.
I understand, sir.
I shall tend to my duty and see to it... that every drop of alcohol is thrown overboard.
Come on,Jim.
Don't bother, Captain.
You can go if you want to,Jim.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
Oh, well. I guess the human beings wanna hang out together... don't wanna spend time with a rat and a, uh--
- Uh, uh, whatever.
- Yeah.
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!
Oh, that's great.
Cute couple.
Stop it!
I never felt like this before.
- Denise, what I'm trying to say--
- Yes?
- What I'm trying to say is--
- Yes?
- What I mean to say is, I--
- Yes?
I'm sorry your present didn't work out.
Oh,Jim, Smollett sails by rules and laws.
That's what bein' a captain's all about.
Me, I sails by the stars.
Stars?
North,Jim. Find me north out there among them stars.
Well, that's easy.
Ah, yeah, but what if you don't have a compass?
Long John, please don't drop it.
It was my father's.
It's all I have of his.
Please. Please.
I'm sorry, lad.
I were only foolin'.
- How old were you when he died, then?
- Seven.
I were eight when my father died at sea.
- First mate, he was.
- My father was a first mate too.
Was he, now?
By the powers.
What a coincidence.
Now,Jim, that be Polaris, the North Star.
Even in the China Sea, that's north.
- North. Polaris.
- Uh-huh.
- So we must be heading southwest.
- Smart as paint you are, lad.
Smart as paint.
Now, that gets old Long John to wonderin'.
Why would we be sailin' southwest?
The scuttlebutt among the crew is that, uh... we're sailin' for buried treasure... and, uh, someone on board... has a map.
'Course, none of my concern,Jim.
I'm just a ship's cook.
Such matters are best suited to Captain Smollett.
Come on, Long John.
You could captain this ship.
That I could, lad.
Maybe someday I will.
- Moonlight swim?
- Okay.
Oh, Smolly, my love for you... is deeper than the deep, blue sea.
Get on with you! Go on!
Hi,Jim!
- Yo,Jimbo! Mornin', Long--
- Hi, Long John. Good morning.
Well, at least one of us is having a good time.
Ah, Rizzo, it's not so bad.
Angel Marie said that later on... he'd throw a line out the back and let me drag along the bottom.
I don't know about this crew.
I feel like they're always
That's just a figment of your imagination.
This is a figment of my imagination?
Now, tell us where the map is... or we'll tear ya limb from limb!
Never. My friend and I will never tell.
Hey, hey, there could be extenuatin' circumstances.
I mean, you know--
Wh-- I b-- If--
Maybe they'll ask real nice.
- In your dreams!
- Do it, Monty! Do it!
Yeah, do it to me!
Yes! More!
- Oh, no, I can't look.
- Look at this!
I'm taller!
This is so cool!
I may even have a future with the NBA.
This won't work! He likes it!
Let's torture the rat!
- Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah!
- Oh, no, no!
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yes.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, please, no! I hate basketball!
I got a lovely recipe for blackened rat.
I say!
This does not look safe!
- What? What? What? What?
- I b-- I burned my hand.
Kiss it or something!
Poodly, poodly, poodly, poodly, poodly.
Mr Arrow, lock those three up for the remainder of the voyage.
- Yes, sir!
- You can't hold us!
- To the brig! Move along!
- Will you stop crying!
- Move along.
- Oh, good. That's good. Yeah.
Master Hawkins, may I see you in my cabin, please?
Yes, sir.
- Ready, Mr Gonzo?
- Ready!
Tie off the rope, Beaker!
We call this the window shade cure.
All right.
Snip, snip, snip.
Oh, great! Wow!
That was so cool!
Hmm? Oh, sure.
- Who's the lady pig, sir?
- Never mind that,Jim. Listen.
I'm hoping you're willing to give me the map now,
I'd rather not, sir.
I'd hoped it wouldn't come to this,Jim, but... as captain, I order you to give me the map.
- Mr Arrow?
- Aye, aye, Captain.
Lock up this treasure map.
It will be safe in here, sir.
It's been six weeks since we left England.
Five days since we had a breeze.
No!
I got the madness!
I got cabin fever!
I've got it too!
Cabin fever!
I got cabin fever
It's burning in my brain
I got cabin fever
It's driving me insane
We got cabin fever
We're flipping our bandannas
Been stuck at sea so long
that we have simply gone bananas
We, we, we got cabin fever
We lost what sense we had
We got cabin fever
We're all going mad
Grab your partner by the ears
Lash him to the wheel
Do-si-do, step on his toe
Listen to him squeal
Allemande left
Allemande right
It's time to sail or sink
Swing your partner
over the side
- Drop him in the drink
- We've got cabin fever.
- No ifs, ands or buts.
- We're disoriented.
- And demented.
- And a little nuts.
Volkswagen car
We were sailing, sailing
The wind was on our side
And then it died.
I got cabin fever
I think I lost my grip
I'd like to get my hands
on whoever wrote this script
I was floating
'neath the tropic moon
And dreaming
of a blue lagoon
Now I'm as crazy as a loon
Cabin fever
has ravaged all aboard
This one small vessel
has become a floating psycho ward
We were sailing, sailing
heading who knows where
And now though
we're all here
We're not all there
Cabin fever!
- The wind is back.
- What are we doing?
What's goin' on here?
- What was that?
- I feel like such a fool.
- Yeah, me too.
- I hope nobody saw that. Embarrassing.
- Get us outta here! Help!
- We didn't hit him!
Come on. Let us out.
We was only joking.
- Hey, Long John!
Hey, get us outta here!
- Hey-ey-ey, Polly.
- What?
- What was that song that just happened?
- What are you talkin' about?
You know.
Cabin Fever
- That.
- You see,John?
You gotta get us outta here now!
Clueless is startin' to go crackers!
Here you go.
- Your bread and water for today.
- But I ordered shrimp scampi.
It's more than you deserve, ya villainous dogs!
Oh,Jim.
By rights,
I should be locked up too... for lettin' thieves like them aboard this ship.
Oh, it chills me... to think that they almost killed your little friends... looking for some daft treasure map.
None of this would've happened if I'd have given Captain Smollet the--
What, lad?
I'm not really sure I should be talking about this with you or with anyone.
You mean, you've really got a treasure map?
Not any more. Mr Arrow took it and locked it up in the captain's cabin.
You must promise to keep it a secret.
Don't bother your head about that.
You've only told old Long John.
Now, you run along and do your chores. Go on.
Go on.
Safely now. Safely.
Steady as she goes.
Oh. Mr Silver, good evening.
Wicked fog tonight, sir.
Reminds me of the night we ran aground off the pampas.
Half the crew drowned in leaky lifeboats.
Ah, it were a terrible shame.
- Leaky lifeboats?
- Oh, a common occurrence, sir.
A little-used piece of equipment falls into disrepair...
- and becomes, shall we say--
- Unsafe?
Oh, I'm not sayin' our lifeboats are unsafe, sir.
I'm not sayin' we got problems--
Still--
Hmm. Hmm.
The caulking appears tight.
No dampness under the gunwale.
This one seems seaworthy.
Well, sir, they do, of course, until you get them out in the open ocean.
- Cast me off, Mr Silver.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Oh, sir, is there anything I can hold for you for safekeeping?
Your hat? Your coat?
- Your keys?
- Hmm? My keys?
Of course. If they were to fall overboard, it would be disastrous.
Oh, that it would, sir.
Cast me off, Mr Silver!
Aye, aye, sir!
Thank you, Mr Silver.
Just doin' my duty, sir.
Oh, yes,John.
Man overboard!
Yes.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Wha--
Mr Arrow's gone overboard, and... all we found was his hat!
Oh, no.
And so, my friends, the sea has claimed another loyal officer and friend.
- This was a person who served--
- I got it! I got it!
Okay, after you, Monty.
- No, after you.
- Will you just come on.
Mr Samuel Arrow, a wonderful man who... used to get us up from our beds before dawn for a good flossing.
- Okay, okay. Now, spread out and find the map.
May the wind be ever at your back,
Samuel Arrow. Rest in peace, my friend.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Shh.
- See? See?
- Wait. Open it. Open it.
No, no, no, we gotta take it to Long John. Come on.
This apple has a worm in it.
That's not a worm.
That's my tail.
What's wrong?
- It just feels so weird.
- You mean, that Mr Arrow's dead?
Yeah, that, and my pants are filled with starfish.
You and your hobbies!
Rizzo!
-Jim, we've missed you! Climb in!
- Can't. I'm doing my chores.
- Oh, come on. Share an apple.
- Yeah, come on!
- Anyway, here's the plan.
- I say we should kill that captain now.
- And then we'll get that twit of a bear!
Oh, hi, Long John.
I'm an easy man.
A gentlemen of fortune, says most.
But it makes me sick at heart to sail with the likes of you.
Now, get this straight.
If anyone mutinies before I says so...
I'll throw you overboard like I did that scurvy mate Mr Arrow!
I says, let the captain steer us closer to the island.
I've got the lad's treasure map now.
When the time is ripe, we'll kill 'em all!
- That's what I said!
- That's what I said!
- Land ho!
- Come on, lads! Let's go!
Yea! Land ho!
Oh, my goodness.
Land ho!
Beachfront property!
Retirement estates!
- Bikinis!
- Bikinis!
Throw the mainsail!
Drop anchor!
Bring her up hard of starboard, helmsman.
Bring those barrels over here, lads!
Helmsman, give a hand with the longboats.
- Captain, may I speak with you?
- I'm sort of busy right now,Jim.
But, Captain, we just heard.
Long John is planning a mutiny,
- Yeah.
- I see.
- Mr Silver?
- Aye, aye, Cap'n!
Mr Silver, I want you to take the crew ashore at once.
We need water and provisions.
Take as long as you want.
Sir! 'Tis a task to my liking, sir.
That it is!
- Quickly, boys. Gather the officers and meet me in my quarters. Quickly.
This is a lucky break.
Captain lettin' us go ashore.
Us with the map and all.
It's like giving the treasure to us on a silver platter.
Aye, that it is, Polly.
Never trust a silver platter.
Follow me, Beakie. Come along.
Jim, lad!
There's room in the boat for one more.
Come along for an adventure.
- I-I can't. The captain wants me.
- Oh, what a shame!
I'll miss you, lad.
That I will.
Um,Jim! I seem to have left my crutch on board.
Hand it to me like a good lad, will ya?
There's a good boy.
Have to be a bit closer than that.
Can't reach it from there.
- Oh!
- Oh! Ah!
Cast away, men!
Be quick now!
Go, go, go!
Don't splash!
The plan is simple.
Once the pirates are ashore, we set sail and return in a year or so.
- By then, all the fight should be out of'em.
That's a brilliant plan.
- Except for one thing.
- What's that?
The pirates have Jim!
I'm tired!
- You're what?
- I'm gettin' tired!
- He says go faster.
- I'm gettin' tired!
Hey, man! I can't figure out what side we're on.
Are we with the pirates or the frog captain?
Oh, hey, man, just play the gig.
Never get involved in politics.
Politics!
Politics!
Jim, lad!
Easy,Jim.
'Tis all in good fun.
Pleased I am to initiate you into our enterprising, um, company.
Which entitles you to all the benefits thereof.
- But I don't want any benefits.
- This is a one-time
Say no, and I will be forced to, um, terminate our relationship.
- You're nothing but murdering pirates.
- Pirates!
Pirates. Oh,Jim.
If that's what you're thinking... you're dead wrong.
When I was just a lad
Looking for my true vocation
My father said
Now, son, this choice
Deserves deliberation
Though you could be a doctor
Or perhaps a financier
My boy, why not consider
a more challenging career
Hey, ho, ho
- You'll cruise to foreign shores
- Sing it, lads!
-And you'll keep your mind and body
sound by working out of doors
True friendship and adventure
are what we can't live without
-And when you're
a professional pirate
Upstage, lads!
This is my only number.
Now take Sir Francis Drake
The Spanish all despise him
But to the British he's a hero
and they idolize him
It's how you look at buccaneers
That makes them bad or good
And I see us as members
of a noble brotherhood
- Hup!
- Hey, ho, ho
- Oh, I love it!
- We're honourable men
And before we lose our tempers
we will always count to ten
On occasion there may be
someone you have to execute
But when you're
a professional pirate
You don't have
to wear a suit
- What?
- I could have been a surgeon
I could have been a lawyer
but I just had too much heart
I could have been in politics
'Cause I've always been
a big spender
And me, I could have been
a contender
Some say that pirates steal
And should be feared and hated
I say we're victims
of bad press
It's all exaggerated
We'd never stab you
in the back
We'd never lie or cheat
We'rejust about the nicest guys
You'd ever want to meet
Well, look at us,Jim.
We're a festival of conviviality.
Congeniality.
- That's conviviality, stupid.
- That's what I said.
We're ready, O capit·n.
Good. You men guard the ship while I'm gone. We'll be back
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Cast off, Mr Beaker.
Thanks for coming along, men.
- Are you kidding? Jim is family.
- Yeah.
Tell the truth, lad.
Do you really think the captain and the squire... are planning to share the treasure with the likes of us?
Can't hear ya.
No?
And we being the rightful owners.
Flint's own crew, who shed our blood getting it here!
Join us, lad.
Donate your compass to the treasure hunt and get a full share!
Hey, ho, ho
It's one for all for one
And we'll share
and share alike with you
And love you like a son
We're gentlemen of fortune
and that's what we're proud to be
And when you're
a professional pirate
You'll be honest
brave and free
The soul of decency
You'll be loyal and fair
and on the square
And most importantly
When you're
a professional pirate
You're always in the best
Of company
- Down!
- There! Captain Smollett
Don't get your hopes up, laddie.
I've taken the liberty of hiding a few of my best men aboard.
If a second round follows... it means they've taken over the Hispaniola... and I'm the new cap'n.
Now, then.
Yea!
How infortuitous our firearms weren't loaded, Beakie.
I'll say.
We might have shot somebody.
I'm the only friend you got in the world now,Jim.
Let's dig up the treasure together, eh?
Shipmates, remember?
- We'll be needing your compass, though.
- No.
I'll be taking it either way,Jim.
Yea!
Come on then, lad.
Let's not waste time.
Well, it's too dark to do anything now.
We'll camp here and wait for first light.
Oh. Hey, Rizzo, relax!
Don't be so afraid.
Oh, I've gone way beyond afraid.
Right now I'm somewhere between bed-wetting and a near-death experience.
- Good night, boys.
- Well, good night.
- 'Night, Rizzo.
- Yeah, sure.
Gonzo?
Is that you, Gonzo?
Boy, Gonzo, it sounds like you're coming down with a little cold there.
I-I-I'm just gonna light a match, if you don't mind, here.
Long John, look!
Flint hung 'em up there after he gullied 'em... to mark the trail to the treasure.
Wicked sense of humour ol' Flinty had.
- I-It's a sign. This is a cursed place.
- Yeah!
Well, there's an informed opinion.
All right,Jim, lad, where to from here?
''On a heading of 1 7 9 degrees... walk 31 2 paces from where the dead men hang high.''
That way!
- We're gonna go? We're gonna--
- Come on!
Howdy vous, stinky froggy man and friends.
I am Spa'am,
High Priest of the Boars.
You mucho wickedness go trespass on island.
Now you suffer the wrath of our queen...
Boom Sha-Kal-a-Kal.
Terrific. Captured by crazed wild pigs and sacrificed hideously
- Are we lucky or what?
- Silence, smelly sailor mans!
You have violated sacred island.
Uh-uh, excuse me.
I am Captain Smollett.
We mean no harm to your culture.
We embrace all creatures of different nationalities.
Silence!
Bring forth
Boom Sha-Kal-a-Kal.
That can't be good.

- Oh, knock it off!
- Huh?
Oh, ha-ha. Greetings.
Moi am Benjamina Gunn.
Maroonee, temptress and queen of this i--
Smolly, can it be you?
Benjamina.
Hi-ya!
Oh, uh, old girlfriend.
Tie 'em back in their stakes!
- This is it.
What if Clueless is right?
Wh-What if it is c-cursed?
I'll show you what
I think of your curse.
You mewling, little, lily-livered... toffee-hearted, little wuss of a crustacean!
''Treasure buried here.''
Oi, we don't even have to dig it up!
Come on, mates!
The treasure's ours!
There's no treasure, Silver!
You brought us here for nothin'!
- Yeah!
- And now we'll be tried for mutiny!
- That's right!
- Yeah!
I say we should kill him!
Run, lad!
Save yourself!
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because I like you, boy.
I hope you didn't think
I was lying about that.
- Get him!
- Run!
Take greeny, flippy, bulgy-eyed one away.
- What?
- Others stay. Chop-chop!
- What? Oh. Ah. Oh. Uh.
- Hey, wait! Where are you taking him?
Hmm ver-di-dee-voom
Ver-di-dee-doo
Ver-di-ver-di-dee-voom
ver-di-voo
Bork, bork
Hmm. First take-ee the mousie, then skewer the mousie!
- Well, how else do you think we were gonna get him in this movie?
- Oh!
- Whoa!
- Oh. I wish we were back at the
Admiral Benbow eating table scraps.
Well, this is terrible! This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me!
- Wait a second! I've been cut loose!
- Hiya, guys.
-Jim, they've got Captain Smollett.
- I know. Come on.
Oh, okay.
Where will we go?
Tom, Tom, Tom!
Ohhh!
Dead Tom's dead!
Long John shot him!
But Dead Tom's always been dead.
That's why he's called Dead Tom.
- Oh.
- Can we get on with this?
- Clueless!
- Yeah, yeah?
- Give it to him!
- Yeah!
But, uh, it's not even his birthday.
- No, no, no, no! The paper!
- Oh.
This is for you.
- The Black Spot?
- Yeah.
You dare to give me the Black Spot?
- Uh, he-he told me to.
- Wh-- Shut up, will ya?
And it's drawn on a page from the Bible.
You tore a page from the Holy Scriptures...
- to make a pirate's death sentence?
- Uh, here.
Ohhh, the red hot gates of hell... are creeping open!
Satan is heating his pokers for you... you blasphemous heathens!
- Fall down on your knees...
- Oh! and beg for deliverance from damnation!
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive me!
Very good.
You're forgiven.
- Oh, thank you.
- Now untie me!
Okay, okay. Untie him.
- And let's go find the treasure!
- Yeah!
Oh, oh, you are a good man.
You are a kind man.
A handsome man.
- Precious.
- Oh, he's-- You're precious a-and--
- Beautiful.
- And he's beautiful. Oh.
Yeah, here's the boat.
Oh, no!
Well, that won't help us.
We're gonna have to swim to the ship.
Hello! Earth to Jimbo.
Swimming to a ship that's full of killer pirates to save the captain
- Look!
- Yes. The gunwale and keel
- Mr Arrow!
- Mr Arrow!
- Over here!
- Mr Arrow, over here!
Oh. Oh, boys.
Come join me... aboard this exceptionally safe little boat.
Hmm.
By the way, that Silver fellow may not be trustworthy.
- Ha-ha! Now he tells us!
- Yeah.
And here's a photo opportunity you will not want to miss.
The actual jungle location for the movie
Muppet Treasure Island.
- Oh, my goodness!
- Keep up, people.
- Hey, when do we eat?
- Oh, my feet are killing me.
Of all the backwater, no-class piles of sand in the ocean... you had to wash up on mine.
Benjamina, I just want you to know that I'm sorry.
Sorry? No, no, sorry doesn't cut it.
You left me standing at the altar!
I was on a ship headed for Zanzibar. I got cold feet.
You're a frog.
You're supposed to have cold feet.
My mother came all the way from France.
I was wearing her white lace dress.
The cake was filled with lemon custard!
Mina, fate has brought us together again.
Well, actually, buried treasure and pirates brought us together--
Don't you start with me about pirates!
After you jilted me, I took up with this Bernie Flint.
- The man was totally codependent.
- You and Captain Flint?
Well, he was a pirate, I was a lady.
You know the story.
Smolly? He marooned me.
Me!
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Th-This is all my fault.
Oh, what have I done to you?
- Mushy-mushy!
- Kissy-kissy!
Bravo, Cap'n.
Touchin' reunion, Benjamina.
This seems to be your day for renewing old... acquaintances.
Oh, well, hello, Long John.
- Oh, no! Him too?
- Well, if you'd married me.
Well, what does that have to do with it?
- I'm a pig! I need commitment!
- Commitment?
Now, I'm not gonna be really patient about this, Benjamina.
Where is the treasure?
Um, I just may not tell you. Hmm.
Oh, don't play games with me, lass.
I tell you,
I'm not a patient man.
Stop! Give up now... weak and tiny pirate mans... or die like stinking dogs.
Hmm, we see you have boom-boom sticks.
Bye-bye.
Oh, brother!
- Now, Benjamina.
- What?
Where is the treasure?
There is no treasure.
I-It was all a clever ruse. H-Ha!
So where did you get that gold necklace you're wearing?
The one made of Spanish doubloons.
Aye.
Um...
Shopping Channel?
No!
Shh.
- Shh.
- Shh.
Oh, fiddle!
Make yourself useful.
Try and save us. Do something!
Shh!
Oh, Master Hawkins, you've come to rescue us.
I should've let him live in my finger.
We're ready,
Master Hawkins.
- Do you think this will work, Dr Livesey?
My research indicates that pirates are very superstitious.
Boogie, boogie, boogie!
I am the ghost of Samuel Arrow.
Boogie!
Come on.
We've got to save the captain!
You were so good, Mr Arrow.
That was beautiful.
What do we do next?
What do we do now? Uh,Jim?
- Weigh anchor?
- Weigh anchor.
- Set the sails.
- Set the sails!
- And you, Squire Trelawney.
- Uh, n-n-now, Master Hawkins, I-I-I--
You take the helm.
Ah! Step aside, Mr Bimbo.
I shall be taking the helm.
Hurry, Rizzo!
I'm going as fast as I can.
Oh! Smolly, my love!
Oh, oh!
Smolly!
You can't hurt my frog!
Don't tell him anything, Mina.
I beg you!
He'll only kill you too.
Don't listen to him!
Now... for the last time... where's the blasted treasure?
- Yeah!
- Hah!
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
The treasure's at my place.
North trail, split-level hut with the pink lawn furniture.
Now free him at once, you scoundrel!
You know, I'm beginning to see a pattern in the men I date.
Yeah, well, uh, uh, the past is behind us.
And the future below us.
Oh, it's okay, Mina.
We're together again.
Yes, despite it all... we have each other.
- Oh, don't cry for me, Benjamina.
- Pardon?
Was I dumb
or was I blind
Or did my heart
just lose its mind
Why'd I go and throw
Our perfect dream away
Looking back
I'll never know
How I ever let you go
But destiny could see
we deserved
To have another day
Love led us here
Right back
to where we belong
We followed a star
and here we are
Now heaven seems so near
Love led us here
Now I know that life
Can take you by surprise
And sweep you off your feet
Did this happen to us
Or are wejust dreaming
Love led us here
Right back
to where we belong
We followed a star
and here we are
Now heaven seems so near
Love led us here
So take my hand
And have no fear
We'll be all right
Love led us
Here
Oh, Smolly.
You saved me.
Come on, men!
It's back to Blighty now, lads!
The treasure's all ours!
Hurry. Come on.
Get in the boat.
Long John! Long John!
Look! The ship!
Uh, yeah--
What are they doing?
There's no one on board.
It's coming straight for us!
I-It's the ghost of Captain Flinty.
He's coming to kill us.
Come back, you cowards!
Hawkins.
Look. It's the captain and the pig.
Oh, no!
Head for those cliffs.
- Head for the cliffs, Squire.
- Aye, aye! Uh. Oh.
Oh, Beakie, Beakie.
Look, look!
I think we're going to need a net.
Come along.
Get back there, you yellow-bellied bilge rats!
I'm not losing that treasure now! Get out!
We're lowering the net now.
All right, let's go. Okay.
That's it. Beautiful. Beautiful.
- We're coming, Captain Smollett!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Steady! Steady!
- Careful!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
- We got 'em!
- Oh, ho, ho! Yes!
- Ahh!
- Oh, no!
Waldorf, you old fool!
We're heroes!
We saved the pig and the frog!
Well, it was too late to save the movie.
Welcome aboard,
Captain Smollett.
And welcome to your lady pig friend.
Ah! Look out! Ah!
The captain must have his sword.
Whoa!
Wow! Ha!
Yah!
Captain!
Fight, you idiots!
Captain!
- Here!
- Ha! Ah!
- Wah!
- All right! No more Ms Nice Guy!
No one maroons me and gets away with it!
- Good to see you alive, Mr Arrow.
- Huh! Thank you, Captain.
Geronimo!
Oh, what am I gonna do? Oh!
- Come on!
- Come on, you! Hey!
- Oh, sorry.
- En garde!
- Mi casa es su casa.
- Ah, I make cheese
- Hi-yee, De Soto! Hi-ya!
- Oh, yah!
!!Cucaracha!
- Hah!
- Ahhh!
Come on,Jerry!
He's just a kid!
- Ohhh!
- Okay, okay, okay!
Okay, I give.
Uncle. Uh, I'm dead.
Oh, oh, oh, Mr Bimbo, help!
- Am I dead?
- Huh?
- Wonderful!
- Uh--
- Mr Bimbo, that was some amazing swordplay.
Oh, watch out, Mr Arrow!
Well, thank you. But aren't you supposed to be fighting against us?
Are you kiddin'?
I love you guys!
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Cowabunga!
Come on. Fight.
Where are you?
- Ohhh!
- Hmm.
And as for you!
- Oh!
- Silver!
Hmm-hmm. Hah!
Hah! Hah!
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size, huh?
- Ah. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Wow!
Yes! Yes! Smolly! Yes!
- Hah!
- Yes!
Ha-ha, Silver!
Ha-ha, ho-ho!
Not bad for an amphibian.
Smolly, Smolly, he's our man!
If he can't do it, no one can! Yea!
- Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha!
- Excuse me.
Ohhh!
Uh-- Uh-- Uh--
I'm a frog.
You know, slippery hands.
Uh, you know, I never really believed that violence solved anything anyway.
Really? Allow me to disagree, Cap'n.
Kill Captain Smollett, and you'll have to kill me.
Kill Jim, and you'll have to kill me.
Kill Gonzo, and you'll have to kill me.
Kill Squire Trelawney and Mr Bimbo... and you'll have to negotiate strenuously.
Going somewhere,
John-John?
Well, Mr Hawkins, it seems your little family... has come together against me.
- We're doomed.
- Yeah.
Well, you know, I, for one, feel better about myself.
Yeah. A-And I believe that I have learned a valuable lesson.
- Why, you!
- Shut up!
Okay, stop biting me.
Okay, I said something wrong!
Silver!
I suppose you'll be blowing the whistle on me now, won't you,Jim?
I suppose I will. You have to return to Bristol to stand trial.
Oh, I'm sorry,Jim.
I got a terrible fear of hanging.
We're shipmates, aren't we,Jim?
Gentlemen of fortune, together.
Give us one more chance?
Oh, hell,Jim.
I could never harm you.
You're honest and brave and true.
- You didn't learn that from me.
- I learnt it from my friends,
Now take your oars and row away.
I never want to see you again, ever.
Oh,Jim!
'Tis a shame, really.
We'd have made
Well done,Jim.
Your father would be proud.
Captain Smollett,
I have most distressing news.
One of the jolly boats is missing, and I know for a fact
Ahhh!
This is not fun.
Flaubert, meet Da-Da.
- Ready to sail, sir.
- Hmm.
Where to,
Captain Hawkins?
To wherever the wind may take us.
Off to Zanzibar, to meet the Zanzibarbarians.
Oh, brother.
Here they go again.
Love power
Love power
Love power
A little love power
Stronger than the hurricane
And softer than
the summer rain
- Love power
- What kind of power
A little love power
It can lift you up
Lift you up when you get low
And make your life

Whoa-oh
There ain't no sun
in the morning sky
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh
Breeze ain't blowing
and the bird don't fly

Lift you up when you get low
And make your life
bright as the rainbow
Whoa-oh
So many people
they feel so bad
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, they make the money
but they still so sad
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh
Nobody told them
that it ain't that stuff
That makes life worthwhile
'Cause even if
you've got enough
You got less than nothing
till you know for certain
Enough to put your faith in
It feels so good
when everybody feels
- Love power
- People, can you feel it
A little love power
Lift you up when you get low
And make your life
bright as the rainbow
Let me tell you now

And softer

- Can you feel it, oh
- Love power
- What kind of power
- A little love power
It can lift you up
Lift you up when you get low
And make your life
bright as the rainbow
- One love
- Lift you up when you get low
-And make your life
bright as the rainbow
May I call you Johnny?
Stop me if you heard this one.
Why does the ocean roar?
Give up?
You would, too, if you had crabs on your bottom... and oysters in your bed.
Get it? Oysters? Bed?
Ooh, I love that one.
I'm tellin' ya, I got a million more just like that.
Was I dumb
Or was I blind
Or did my heart
just lose its mind
Why'd I go and throw
Our perfect dream away
Oh, looking back
I'll never know
How I ever let you go
But destiny could see
we deserve
To have another day
Love led us here
Right back
to where we belong
We followed a star
and here we are
Now heaven seems so near
Love led us here
Love led us here
Ooh
I confess
It's sad but true
- Sad but true
- I lost myself when I lost you
But I held your memory
Through each lonely night
Oh, let's forget
- What's gone before
- What's gone
- Now we both
know so much more
And we've been given
another chance
To make it work out right
Make it work
Love led us here
Right back
to where we belong
We followed a star
and here we are
Now heaven seems so near
Love led us here
Now I know that life
can take you by surprise
And sweep you off your feet
Did this happen to us
Or are we just dreamin'
Dreamin'
We followed a star
and here we are
Now heaven seems so near
Love led us here
So take my hand
And have no fear
We'll be all right
Love led us
Here
The Lord is
My shepherd
I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down
In green pastures
He leadeth me
Beside the still--
Still waters
He restoreth my soul
Thy rod
And Thy staff
Pig! Grow up, can't you?
Coffee, anyone?
- Franta?
- No, I 'm in a hurry.
Another job?
You must be rolling in it.
Jarda
Can you lend me a hundred till Monday?
You'll get it back.
I know.
Or else I wouldn't lend it.
Thanks
Finally!
Now, this car is ideal, man.
- So practical.
- Get a Trabant, at least.
How much is a Trabant?
- New or used?
- Used.
You'd need a hatchback.
Twenty, twenty-five thousand.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm going, idiot!
They sure looked better from behind.
I didn't look back. So for me, they'll be beautiful forever.
Bills, you bitches, green!
Greedy vultures, the lot of you.
Hi, Helenka?
This is Louka.
I suddenly felt so lonely somehow... so guess who I thought of?
That's right, you.
Helenka... you wouldn't be scared of a night in my tower?
To the theatre?
Of course I'm not angry.
How could I be?
No, get going then. Bye.
Zuzi?
It's me, Louka.
Zuzi...
I suddenly felt so lonely somehow... so guess who I thought of?
You, of course.
Oh, he's at home?
Okay. Yeah. Bye.
"Socialism:
Our Unwavering Security"
So called Czechoslovak socialism... is undergoing just cosmetic democratization.
Economically insufficient... it has no regard for human dignity.
The system is nearing collapse.
Twenty thousand!
Crooks!
This is Radio Free Europe.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'd say that inscription needs restoring.
That is right. Rain did it.
- I could do it for you.
- What do you mean?
I restore headstones.
How much would it be altogether?
Well, it's not that long.
Well, there is two, four, six...
Thirty-six letters.
That would be 180 crowns.
Oh, my. Why is it so expensive?
Because there's real gold dust in there.
See how it glitters? These flakes?
They are real gold flakes.
Pity there are two T's in his name.
You could've saved five crowns.
Franta!
He maketh me to lie down
In green pastures
He leadeth me
Beside the still waters
Louka, you fool. Do you know how long
I've waited for this?
Two years.
Since usher Hajkova's funeral.
- That's awful.
- Such a long time!
No, it's awful that we measure time in funerals, like some undertakers.
You were never married, were you?
No.
My late father always said... if you want a musical career, don't get married.
Music means celibacy.
Do you have hiccups?
Yes...well...allways...
When....it's nice.
Always afterwards.
You know what?
Bite on your left pinky.
It puts pressure on the hiccupping points.
You are kidding.
They say, it is good to lift your left leg... at the same time as your right arm... so the blood drains out.
They say that works too.
OK, right hand...
First time I heard that one.
What's that noise?
It's the pigeons.
Sharpening their beaks on the window sill.
Wait, I think I got it backwards.
The other way.
Lift up your leg.
- That's my right leg.
- Okay, right leg and left arm.
Why did they toss you out of the Philharmonic... when you play so well?
I don't feel like talking about it.
Then don't.
You know what? It works.
I told you it does.
Why are they sharpening their beaks?
Why?
Now, that one I can explain.
To make them sharp.
You're such a jerk!
- Hail, comrade!
- And God bless you too.
I've loads of orders for you.
Three in gold, two in silver.
Here you are.
It's all written down.
Those are the grave numbers.
Mr. Broz, a gravedigger like you brings joy to the whole cemetery.
You're doing it so well.
I'm trying... not to smudge it.
I'm telling you!
Don't do it!
You only owe me
37,600 crowns now.
I'm doing my best.
I really need a car to earn more.
We could sort out the car problem.
Yes, but how would I pay for it?
I have a wonderful job for you.
Money like you never saw.
30,000 for a day's work.
- Straight into your pocket.
- Daddy.
Andy has a tick and it's real big.
Give him here.
Do you have a pet at home?
No, no pets.
Do you have some kid at least?
- No kids either.
- So what do you have?
Go play, girls.
I'll deal with the tick.
I won't beat around the bush.
It's a marriage.
- I have this old "aunt."
- No, Mr. Broz.
I won't marry.
Certainly not some old aunt.
- She's Russian.
- Even worse.
It's not the aunt.
It's her niece.
Not even a niece, Mr. Broz.
Mr. Louka, it would be a fake marriage.
No, I'm against marriage... in any shape or form.
- Cheers, cheers.
- He's right.
Cheers, Mr. Louka.
This niece needs Czech papers... to avoid being sent back to Russia.
There it is.
Sounds fishy.
It's not for me.
We cremate, you parasite.
Divorce in six months.
You'll be free as a bird.
- Is Andy here?
- He had a tick.
- I thought I'd lost you.
- We're talking business.
- You know how I feel about this.
- Don't worry.
Just shut the door.
The wedding's just for show.
For appearances.
For 40 grand, Mr. Louka.
Before you said 30.
She'd be willingly to pay you 40.
You could buy a car and still repay me 20,000.
It's better than renovating headstones.
Graves, graves.
Screw this job.
I see you've got lots of pets.
A gravedigger has to have...
...living things around him.
Her name is Nadezhda.
It's just business.
Deal? So what?
So not, Mr. Broz, I can't
It's not for me.
"PERESTROYKA IS THE MATTER OF ALL"
Franta, stop that!
Come to see your mother, have you?
- Hello!
- Hello!
Franta!
Come again on Tuesday and practice!
Today it was pretty miserable.
I had a feeling you'd come.
Guess what I've made for lunch.
Potato dumplings.
I was in the pharmacy.
I said, I'll make him dumplings.
- That's great, Mom.
- Vitulka wrote.
It's in the bureau.
Read it aloud if you're reading it.
Maybe later.
Sometimes I think you don't like your brother.
What did he do to you?
What he did was leave.
You can't hold anything against him.
He came there with nothing... and now he has got clients.
He has got clients and I've got crap.
But you'll have money again,
Franta. You're a virtuoso player.
You'll get back on your feet again.
Eat up. There's more.
Mr. Holocek says... that we need new gutters.
New gutters?
Yes, he said they've rusted through.
He said that 2,000 would cover... materials and labour.
How am I going to get the money?
This house has cleaned me out.
I had to sell my car.
I'm in debt.
Where am I going to get the money?
Don't talk that way.
You know the house is yours... now you've bought your brother's share.
If you hadn't, we'd have lost it to the state... when Vitulka emigrated.
Would you have... wanted me to live with strangers?
Hey, Franta!
Still fiddling for corpses?
And you? Still squeaking for gallbladder patients?
Of course.
I've got to go. I'll be late for the bus. Good-bye, Mrs. Loukova.
What's all this about corpses?
That's what we call a concert audience... when it's dead; when they don't respond.
It was blocked here.
Otherwise, the gutters are in fairly good shape.
Except... for the odd spot.
Well, I'll be damned.
How did this get here?
It's not very valuable, Franta.
It's just a piece of costume jewellery.
- Where did you get this?
- I found it.
And what do you think it's worth?
I really have no idea.
Well, look,
I could give you five... maybe ten crowns for it.
Thank you.
A couple's on your street and they get into a fight.
She says, "You and your two-bit trinket can both go to hell!"
Enraged, she throws it in the air.
That's it.
- Mr. Broz, I think I agree.
- Of course.
There's no other explanation.
I mean, I agree to this bogus marriage, I think.
You could talk to Nadezhda in German.
She's an interpreter between German and Russian.
I'm afraid I speak neither.
I see, I see
First you don't like Germans, then you don't like Russians.
It's not that.
I just have no head for languages.
Anyway, who cares how they talk together?
Every Czech knows some Russian.
Every Czech can speak a bit of Russian.
Except me.
Except him?
Nobody will suspect.
What's important here... is for Maestro Louka to know there'll be no tricks.
Divorce in six months.
I promise you, that's all.
A fake marriage.
Nothing hidden.
Nadezhda has a little son.
And she's young.
And you could be her father.
- What would she do with you?
- She's right.
Tamara, tell him... it will be like a real wedding.
She says it'll be like... on a real wedding, so... we must have a reception... and a wedding night.
Everything normalish...
Like a normal wedding.
A wedding night?
The first night you'll sleep together.
But in different rooms... to avoid suspicion in case you're followed.
Waiter, another vodka, please.
The down payment.
Do you have any idea what bribes cost in Russia?
Come here.
Don't even ask.
Franta, I'm amazed.
Congratulations.
The best of luck.
She's a beauty.
A real beauty!
Must you play everywhere?
Friends!
Friends!
I like my wife Nadezhda very much.
I like my wife very much.
But of course!
- I have just decided...
- I decided... that Nadezhda and I... shall together enjoy a real... and truly beautiful wedding night.
- What did he say?
- Some joke.
Because it would be a great pity... if a Czech man denied... his Russian wife her unde-- undeni--
- undeniable right.
- Translate, Tamara.
I promise tonight...
I'll be hot-blooded as any Russian Don Juan.
Go screw your mother!
I'll be... a real Casanova!
They don't understand your jokes.
They're terrified.
That's how it should be.
Every bride should be terrified on her wedding night.
The baby's coming.
The contractions have started.
She's having a baby.
The contractions have started.
Broz, look after the children.
Nadezhda Ivanovna.
Wife of mine.
New, isn't it?
It's used, Mom.
It looks pretty new to me.
No rust anywhere.
These cars never rust. It's made from plastic.
Then it was a good buy.
Look at all those Russians.
They're like locusts.
Would you believe it? Lots of
Czechs do business with them.
It's certainly cheaper.
Russian diesel, gasoline, coal.
Collaborating with the occupiers!
Such fine patriots.
When the Russians invaded... people shook their fists; said they wouldn't even give them stale bread or water.
And look at them now.
A fine nation we are.
Can I give you a lift?
Is this your dowry?
I see someone can't keep his mouth shut.
It's a nice car.
You're better off in more ways than one.
Klara, look, this marriage--
I'm not interested.
I live alone.
Nothing has changed.
I'm such an idiot. I nearly got divorced because of you.
Klara...
Let's go to my place.
Stop. I'd like to get out.
Klarena.
I'd really rather get out.
I've done all your washing and ironing.
Great.
We're supposed to decorate the windows. Put up some flags.
Christ, another Communist anniversary?
I can't keep up with them.
They're judging the best-decorated building again.
My windows are too high for them to see.
Don't you believe it.
They watch us like hawks.
Put up one Russian flag and one of ours... so they leave me in peace.
That's 70 crowns.
I'll add it to the 200 you already owe me.
You can have it right now.
- Right now?
- Yes.
I don't have any change.
Keep it.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Stoklasa sent me.
He did, did he?
Hold this.
Slowly, slowly!
And what was
Mr. Stoklasa's message?
He wanted you to look me over.
That is, he wanted you to hear me play.
Decorating for the anniversary?
Like hell.
I've outgrown all that.
Like a drink?
Yes, please.
I play the viola, but I want to play the cello.
And what made you...
Decide to switch?
I like the fact that it's so big.
You prefer big instruments, do you?
Yes.
Play something, then.
Show me...
You've got long fingers.
That's good.
You're giving me butterflies.
Squeeze more with your knees.
That's it.
- Shall I play?
- Please.
- Like that?
- Play... play...
Which friend?
Right this minute?
Who's calling?
- Blanka.
- Yes.
We must make it some other time.
That's a pity.
Tell me about it.
Come to the Green Tree.
What?
Come to the Green Tree!
Are we staying here or are we off again?
It's all right here.
So you're a spy.
Is grave digging just a hobby?
Mr. Louka, we're in deep shit.
Nadezhda has emigrated.
Where to?
Germany.
West Germany?
She went as an interpreter... and stayed there.
She has a guy there.
She's crazy about him.
I never told you about him.
Some businessman, married.
I thought he'd visit her here.
No sleeping! You're not at work!
Why not go directly?
From Russia to West Germany?
They're not allowed.
Russians can come here but they can't go there.
So how come she got there from here?
Because she has Czech papers, thanks to you.
Going home? Fine, go then.
Also she left her son here, so she was allowed to go.
Why go, if he's married?
That's not our problem,
Mr. Louka.
The bad part is that the cops will get interested.
I knew I was being stupid.
I could feel it in my bones.
I'm sorry, Mr. Louka.
But you'll be all right, you'll see.
The boy will stay with the aunt.
And when should I expect them?
- Who?
- The cops.
I'd say soon.
Frantisek Louka?
You're this boy's father?
"Father?"
The lady he was staying with... is downstairs in our ambulance.
She's had a stroke.
She says you'll take over.
But I'm only a distant father.
I mean to say a stepfather.
That's your problem.
Sort it out yourselves.
She sent him here while she's in the hospital.
Come on then.
Don't just stand there.
Come on in.
Mr. Broz, have you heard?
Oh, so you do know?
Then come fetch him right now.
This wasn't part of the deal.
We can't solve this on the telephone.
Drop by tomorrow.
I can't hear you.
One night won't kill you.
Give him a bath and put him to bed.
Screw this.
You have some slippers?
Something tower indoors?
Holy shit. A fine conversation this is going to be!
This is all I needed.
Here they are.
Slippers.
Yours.
Take your shoes off, see, and put your slippers on.
Look, stop snivelling.
I'm not thrilled myself.
Stick it out for one night here... and then it's off to the gravedigger's.
He got us into this and he'll damn well get us out.
There you go.
Look what we have here.
Some crayons... and paper. You can draw.
Why don't you sit down and draw something?
Draw. Come on, draw!
So, stare out the window.
What do I care?
Be pigheaded then.
Take a good look.
Eat.
At least drink your tea.
Tea.
Russian tea, what you people drink non-stop.
I put sugar in it.
Don't pretend you don't understand.
You must understand something.
We're both Slavs.
I don't speak Russian, you don't speak Czech... but you must understand the word "tea".
We have it, you have it.
We use the same word.
There you go.
Now we're getting someplace.
At the moment there are heavily-armed Soviet soldiers... on the territory of our homeland.
Stop snivelling and sleep.
One night won't kill you.
Fine.
Be that way.
She was against the wedding all along.
Who was?
Marus, my wife.
She kept saying,
"You'll get him into trouble."
She was right about that.
She was.
So I can't ask her to take in a fifth child.
Mr. Louka, our place is a madhouse these days.
Try to put up with him.
I'll take 2,000 crowns off what you owe me.
No, three, 4,000.
And what am I supposed to do with him?
Can't that woman with gold teeth take him in?
Pasha?
Been back in Leningrad for ages.
Look, his aunt will be out of the hospital in a couple of weeks.
Keep the boy.
It's in your best interest.
That's why the aunt left him with you... for your own sake.
Looking after your wife's child... makes your marriage look genuine.
To whom, exactly?
The police, when they interrogate you.
And they will come.
Have you been questioned before?
I was. Once.
The first cop was real nice. The second one was named Novotny.
He was sharp as a razor.
Sooner or later they'll come for you.
And they'll grind you down slowly but surely.
When my old mother taught me to sing
She would often weep
Mr. Louka, you didn't put up the flags.
You said you'd do it and you didn't.
I've been too busy.
I'm doing concerts every day for the workers.
Well yes, but you're the only one who didn't do it.
All the others did.
What a nice little boy.
Who do you belong to, then?
He's my brother's son.
What's your name, dearie?
He won't talk. Is from countryside.
He's terribly shy.
I don't care about the flags... but you're drawing attention to yourself. Unnecessarily.
I'm a quitter.
Last year...
I didn't give a damn and it was okay.
But we mustn't give them any excuse now we're in the shit.
Ours, yours.
What did you say?
Ours.
Yours.
That's right. So you can understand when you want to.
The thing is, we put up your flag because we have to.
Once we put it up in gratitude.
But that was before we realized that you Russians are craps.
You understand?
No, you don't.
You're expansionists!
Wherever you march you stay.
But not you, you'll go back to your aunt.
The moment she gets better...
I'll pack your chemodan
(suitcase) and you'll be off.
Chemodan.
That's all the Russian I know... because they stole mine in Moscow.
You steal suitcases and other people's land.
Ours is red.
What's so beautiful about it?
It's red like your underpants.
Now ours is beautiful.
Ours is red.
Oh, you don't understand a thing.
Look what I bought you.
- Russian eggs.
- Russian?
Some Czech hens...
Lay Russian eggs and they don't even know it.
Grandma!
Hello.
- I've come for my lesson.
- Today?
- Isn't it convenient?
- No, it's fine.
It's just that I have a visitor.
- Is he your little boy?
- No, no...
- A grandson?
- Of course not.
I'm baby-sitting for a colleague from Leningrad.
The boy is Russian.
- Hello, kid.
- Hello.
- What's your name?
- Kolya.
Shall I begin?
We'll put the light on so you don't get scared.
And here's a steamboat.
Ours is red.
So we're putting up flags after all! Mr. Louka
Tamara Komarova.
Nurse, take the child out.
Am I going to see Grandma?
She died yesterday.
At seven A.M.
You're her... what?
Nothing. Just an acquaintance.
We didn't know where to send her things.
Dressing gown, teeth, spectacles, watch...
Where's Grandma?
Grandma is asleep.
We mustn't wake her.
Faster.
There is some Welfare Office.
Ask there.
Say you've got him by marriage.
His mother has left... and you can't look after him due to your job.
Or put him in kindergarten.
You can't take him to cremations.
- Look what he's drawing.
- A coffin, isn't it?
It's not a bad drawing.
Gentlemen, the bakery won't wait.
Are you his dad or his granddad?
His granddad.
Fill out these forms and send them... to Comrade Doom at Social Services.
- And when do you think...?
- I can't say.
I don't understand.
You say the boy is from Yugoslavia.
His parents let him stay with you, just like that?
So he'd see the Czech countryside.
And why is he called Kolya?
That's a Russian name.
Kolya is short for Nikolai, Mom.
It can be a Yugoslav name too.
Couldn't he stay here for a few days?
Who?
He's pale.
He'd have the fresh air and he'd be company for you.
What's the world coming to?
People make a kid and then leave him anywhere.
If someone devotes himself to music, he shouldn't have children.
Like you. It should be either music or a family.
You've put me on the spot.
How long would he stay?
You see them?
Always on the road... driving back and forth.
Ours.
No, not yours.
Those are Russians.
Come here... it's the King.
Russians. Russian soldiers.
What's he saying?
How should I know?
Maybe the uniforms remind him of the Yugoslavs.
Stay here, Kolya.
It's almost ready.
You lied to me.
He's a Russian.
Yes, I lied to you.
He is Russian. OK.
You're in touch with the Russians now?
Mom, all Russians aren't alike.
His parrents...
We're not home.
Oh, come on... he saw me come in.
Excuse us.
Could we wash our hands here?
- Oh, wash your hands?
- The water's off.
The water's off.
The water's off?
There's a burst pipe somewhere.
Sorry to bother you. Good-bye.
It's running.
The water's running!
I won't have a Russian child here.
Don't count with it
Come on, let's go see Uncle Ruzicka.
-The water's running.
-Come on, you will like him.
I don't like it, Frana.
Lying to your own mother.
Vitulka would never do that.
First you show no interest in children and then it's a Russian.
Come look... whip it so.
How's things in Prague?
Same as here.
Do you know what a visionary says?
That it'll all fall apart this year.
They've said that for 40 years.
Stand up, Franta
This visionary had a vision.
The Communists... were buying bars of gold... and fleeing to Russia in great hordes.
But Gorbachev was there, took the bars... and beat them on the ass with them.
Then he said, "Leave the gold here and go home!"
But nobody wanted them at home.
The kids and nurses rebelled first.
They drove the Communists to Albania... with a great pealing of bells... and set up reservations for them there...
Like for the Indians in America.
What a vision!
Why was it the nurses who rebelled?
Who knows. That I can't tell you.
Are they ours?
Yes, yours.
They are going to Moscow.
No, they're here for good.
They just go back and forth.
Do they live here?
Unfortunately.
Like me.
It's cancelled today. The Russian kids from the barracks... all saw it yesterday.
They're not showing it. Come on.
How big an audience do you need?
At least five.
But this is a Russian cartoon.
"Angelika" is on tomorrow.
Give me five tickets.
Mr. Lansky, we're going to show it after all.
Hi, Franta.
Where's Grandma?
She's asleep.
Mr. Louka, you got a registered letter.
I signed so you wouldn't have to go to the post office.
Just imagine!
Our building came in second in the decorations competition.
We'd have come in first too, if it wasn't for that idiot Pech.
It's from the police.
Probably a parking ticket.
I suppose you'll have to show up in person.
I'm Pokorny.
You would be Mr. Louka.
You brought...
There's nobody to look after him.
But during the interrogation...
Comrade, could you take him?
He'll bawl his head off.
Oh, hell...
We've never done this before.
Never before, Mr. Louka.
Don't you have children?
Yes, but I don't take them to work.
Maybe I could ask Jitka.
Jitka, you'll have to look after this boy.
Use Kopecky's office.
He's out.
Come on.
Go and play with Auntie.
He won't go with strangers.
- Well, how old is he?
- Five.
But he doesn't understand Czech.
He's Russian. Maybe he could stay?
If you have a paper and pencil, he'll draw.
Sit down, Mr. Louka.
Do you have any coloured ones?
He really likes crayons.
So you got married on us,
Mr. Louka.
Well, well, how interesting.
Here you are a confirmed bachelor... and bang! Suddenly at 55...
People do foolish things... especially at my age.
Well, she's young and pretty.
A guy could fall in love pretty quick.
You know how it is.
How did you meet?
- In a restaurant.
- Which one?
It was the Malostranska cafe.
She was there sitting alone and there was no other table free.
We got to talking--
And do you speak Russian well?
No actually. Just a few words...
...left over from school.
- The cigarette.
- Please take one.
No, it fell.
That's always happening.
Very nice.
He draws well.
That violin--
Cello. It has a spike.
Of course.
A violinist would stab himself.
I have a five-year old but he can't draw as well.
- What's his name?
- Radek, after my wife.
- She has a man's name?
- No, it's Radka really.
How's it going?
Captain Novotny, Mr. Louka.
Listen, my dear man... you seem to have a bad influence on your family.
Your brother emigrated.
Your wife emigrated.
You didn't live together long in that tower of yours, did you?
Nobody saw her there.
We lived together a few days... but we didn't get along.
She spoke Russian... and I only spoke Czech.
And you hadn't noticed she didn't speak Czech before the wedding?
Of course.
But there were other problems as well.
She kept opening the windows.
She was so used to Siberian winters.
So we decided we'd live separately.
O.K., you've had your fun.
Now spit it out.
How much did they pay you, smart-ass?
Isn't that a bit rude?
I'll be as rude as I like.
I call a jailbird anything I choose... and that's what you'll be.
I asked you a question!
Comrade, can't you take this child?
We already tried.
How'd you pay for that Trabant?
I saved some and borrowed the rest.
From whom?
My colleague Parizek and Mr. Broz.
Did your wife tell you she would emigrate?
That took me by surprise.
And her son.
That also took you by surprise?
Yes, that too.
What will you do with him?
I'll probably keep him.
Since he's mine by marriage.
Look, my dear man.
This marriage is an obvious scam.
Tell your fairytale of an old goat in love to someone else.
And before your jail, don't think you'll be playing... with the Philharmonic much longer.
You'll be lucky to fiddle at funerals. We'll make sure of that.
That's right.
"He's already only playing funerals!"
Why not try to save your skin?
Just tell us who arranged the wedding... and how much you got for it.
This isn't the last time we'll meet.
Go back home and think it all over.
Then maybe you'll come back... and see us before we send for you.
Well, that's it.
That's it.
"My dear man."
Here we go.
A couple more interrogations and you'll be speaking Czech.
- Well, Marketa!
- No, Misa.
Misa, of course!
What are you up to?
Well I play--
I play in a sort of ensemble.
Jesus, the boy! Excuse me.
A five-year old boy is lost on Line B.
He does not speak Czech.
His name is...
Kolya. He should be taken to the supervisor at any station.
"Donut be skary and donut going nowhere.
You must to stay in metro but we find you. Hello."
End of message in Russian language.
The shoe. Hey. the shoe.
Kolya
"Moskow Station"
You gave me such a fright.
That wasn't a phone call.
It was a phone scream.
It was all this "Kolya, my baby!"
When I said her aunt was dead... and that you had him she almost fainted. She wanted to come... but I talked the idiot out of it.
I told her they'd send her straight to a camp in Siberia.
- What about the Red Cross?
- She applied for the boy... and there are international agreements on mothers and kids.
Oh... she sends you her ragards.
That's very nice of her.
Hello, Grandma.
It's me, Kolya.
Can you hear me?
We went to see you but you were asleep.
Please come back, Grandma.
Come on.
Zuzi? It's Louka.
I suddenly felt so lonely somehow and guess who--
Can you talk?
He's in Warsaw?
Lucky you.
Oh, he's washing!
He takes his time in there, doesn't he?
Listen, I'm looking after a Russian kid.
Russian. Belongs to a violinist from Leningrad.
He can't sleep.
You teach Russian.
Could you read him a fairy tale?
Anything. He's five.
Go and find something.
I'll wait.
She's a teacher.
"Once upon a time" will be.
"The Eagle and the Lamb."
Fantastic! I'll give him the phone.
Kolya Bilyukov.
No, I'm not scared of eagles.
"High on a Caucasian Mountain peak lived an eagle.
One day he flew so high... he reached a star.
On that start here was a little house.
In the house lived an old sheep and her lamb.
'I came for a visit,' said the eagle.
'Let's see how you live here."'
Beautiful.
Thanks, Zuzi.
You left them here?
Black lace ones?
You went home without your panties?
No, I'd have noticed them.
I'd like to see you too, Zuzi, but I can't right now.
I'll call you.
Hello.
What's your name?
My name's Kolya.
Do you want some bread?
Get out of here.
Don't feed them.
They'll take over.
And shut the window.
There's a draft.
Scram!
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He leadeth me
Beside the still waters
What are you doing?
Your job.
That's enough.
We're up as high as the birds.
High up like birds.
His mommy isn't at home?
She's abroad at the moment.
He must have antibiotics.
Every four hours.
Set your alarm clock.
And a quarter aspirin as well.
You have some?
Yes.
There's a danger of meningitis.
If the fever continues, apply cold compresses.
- You can do that?
- Yes, of course.
Will your wife be away long?
Probably.
You'll need a note for your employer.
Yes, maybe.
This will feel a bit cold.
Hold on, it's going to be all right.
You'll be all right now.
Thank you, Klara.
I'm sorry I called you so late.
That's okay.
No, really, I mean it.
Thanks a lot. Good night now.
No need to see me off.
I'm staying 'til morning.
Really? And what will you say at home?
That an old lover of mine got a child by marriage.
And he couldn't cope.
A magpie or a jay.
They steal shiny things.
You're right.
Nobody thought of that.
It's still beautiful... even if it's worthless.
When I said
My husband and I couldn't have children...
I didn't mean that I can't.
You must have misunderstood.
Tonight.
When is he supposed to take his next pill?
At five.
I set the alarm.
You're less selfish than I thought.
I never imagined you'd worry like this about someone else's child.
Neither did I.
Tell me, weren't you afraid... to go through with the fake marriage?
You, a victim of political persecution.
I'm not a victim of political persecution.
Just a victim of my own stupidity.
They used to let me go to the West.
One time they let me go and the Party Officer Blaha said...
"Your brother has emigrated but we trust you."
When I returned, I had to fill in these usual forms and... one of the questions was,
"Did you meet an emigrant?"
I wrote, "Yes."
Then it said, "State in detail what you discussed."
And I just wrote, "Just the usual shit, Comrade Blaha."
Is that all?
I guess he felt hurt.
My god. And I thought you'd done something heroic!
Pathetic, isn't it?
You filled that form out perfectly.
I'd like you to have this.
That's nice.
And you've stopped drawing coffins.
Telephone story.
Oh, a story?
Let's call our teacher Auntie.
"The Eagle and the Lamb."
Could I have the one about the eagle?
I liked that one.
It was the uncle.
He's no good at stories.
You know what?
We'll try to manage by ourself.
Well
Once upon a time, there was a grandpa and a grandma.
A grandpa and a grandma.
They had a grandson who was named Budulinek.
-Budulinek
-That's right
One day Grandma said,
"Budulinek, my dear...
We're going into town.
You'll stay here on your own.
Don't open the door for anyone at all." You see?
Don't open the door for anyone.
That's it.
And so they left.
Otters lived here once.
What's otters?
You and your questions!
It's an animal about this big... with whiskers like me.
These otters caught trouts.
What's trouts?
They're fishes.
-Aha, fishes!
-Good
But because the water is poisoned now by acid rain--
--You can't understand because I don't myself-- the fishes died.
Fishes kaput?
That's right.
So the otters died too.
Otters also kaput?
Yes. So now you have the Otter River... with no otters in it!
Such the river we have.
Jesus Christ!
Some East German is celebrating his birthday.
What's birthday?
That's the day you're born.
And when will I have a birthday?
Well, when were you born?
I know you're five, but when were you born?
I don't know.
It's hard to celebrate your birthday man.
You want to, but even don't know when it is.
Good night, Dad.
Good night.
"The workers reacted to
Anti-Socialist groups trying to destroy our country, clearly.
We not allow to subvert our republic."
Happy birthday
The main thing is that you're healthy and happy.
Look here.
What is it?
Such a beauty!
Do you have to live at the top?
I'm Ms. Doom from the
Department of Social Security.
You sent us an application... regarding this boy some time back.
We've only just gotten around to it.
That was a long time ago.
Everything's changed since then.
You say here that you play at night?
No, only during the day now.
- Where does the boy sleep?
- Over there.
He doesn't have his own bed?
Or room?
No, but there's enough room--
So it's the boy's birthday?
Not really. I don't have his papers so I decided it would be today.
You decided?
Look, Ms. Doom,
I wrote that... when I wasn't coping it very well.
The boy is Russian, isn't he?
Yes, but...
Not now, my dear.
He understands Czech pretty well now.
His mother left for the West and shows no interest in the boy.
She shows.
She's applied to the Red Cross.
- Look, Mr. Lucina.
- Louka.
The matter is, that even though the boy's mother... gained Czech nationality by marriage... she is still Russian.
So the Soviet authorities still have an interest in this child.
The matter may be well taken out of our hands.
They'll probably put him in a creche in the Soviet Union.
That's how I see it.
Look, Ms. Doom... that letter of mine... couldn't it be cancelled?
Why? They'll take care of the boy.
-I'll be back, Mr. Lucina.
-Louka
Next time...
I'll bring someone from the Soviet Embassy... and they can take over.
A nice little boy.
Good-bye.
Chemodan?
Yes, chemodan... before that Doom comes to get us.
Hi, Franta
- What brings you here?
- Can you put us up?
But of course.
Come in.
These armchairs are dangerous a bit.
But if we put this blanket over them...
Springs won't eject.
This is Uncle Houdek, but you'll call him Goudek, I suppose.
Could you believe it? Such a great power, but they can't say... the letter "H".
I'll hide you like some paratroopers.
It'll be my way of joining the resistance.
Do you think your conductor hire me?
Definitely.
Though he'll wonder why master Louka wants to play in a spa band.
We'll tell him--
Christ, that's an idea.
You're convalescing after a gallbladder operation.
Take the waters at the Gagarin Springs.
- Gagarin?
- You go to sleep.
Damn, I love this illegal activity!
"The police blocked National
Avenue and neighbouring streets... so there was no way out.
When faced with the riot police the students scaned...
"We've got naked hands" and sang the national anthem... nevertheless they were beated up..."
I'd hate to be mistaken, Franta, but I think it's just collapsed.
Oh, please. They're beating people and...
Shh! Quiet!
"...blood ran in Prague
Prague's university students call on everyone to demonstrate."
It's a pity we joined the resistance so late.
The lid's off. It's over!
We should be there, Franta.
Trust me, it is comming.
It is comming!
It is comming!
Please let the ambulance through. Thank you.
Glad to oblige!
Glad to oblige!
The kids and the nurses rebelled.
They drove the Communists to Albania... with a great pealing of bells... and set up reservations for them like for the Indians in America.
What a vision!
Well, there's your mom.
That's your mommy.
Come on
Thank you again.
And please forgive me.
Good-bye, Dad.
Good-bye.
When will you come to see us?
Good-bye.
- Remember me?
- Of course I remember.
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
Glenn: First of all, i want to thank everybody for coming.
Giving up your lunch hours and all that.
And, lord knows, very exciting for all of us.
Tucker:
Happy to be here.
Steve: Oh, me, too.
Absolutely. And let's just get our hands right into it.
Who wants to start us off?
Steve: I'll be happy to start.
You know what? Gwen, why don't you start us off?
Gwen: Ok. Sure... you don't need the pointer here, do you?
No. I don't need the pointer. Thanks.
I'll just hold on to it, then.
Glenn:
Oh, she's fine. Gwen?
Gwen: There is a concern that i have that i think needs addressing is that we can't have the port-a-potties too far off the main route, because we do have a lot of seniors.
Steve:
Uh, we've solved that.
We're gonna take the port-a-potties and put 'em right over here.
They're not gonna be in the way.
Gwen: We're gonna put a receptacle over near arts and crafts.
This is the big bins you're talking about?
Steve:
We've got barrels, too.
And we're gonna put the barrels on every corner.
Glenn: Wait a minute.
That's... that's the crate?
Steve: That's the big barrel, 'cause you got the pie-eating going on right over here.
It's more of a dumpster than a barrel.
Glenn: That's another thing.
If anything happens like last year with that pie-eating... which brings me to a point... security.
Oh, god.
Security. I say we put a rifle on here, a man with a rifle here, and a rifle here.
Protect the whole square.
Is that really necessary?
Yes. Remember how much we got egged last year?
Absolutely.
What can i tell you?
We're pleased as punch.
We... we are so proud.
We know that whatever we do here is a first for blaine and a first for missouri, that whatever we do is going to be the standard against which all other sesquicentennials... that's the 150... will be judged.
The people of blaine are can-do people.
In fact, you know, there's an old saying in missouri if you don't like the weather, just wait 5 minutes.
In blaine, i honestly believe with hard work, we can get that down to 3 or 4 minutes.
Phil: Here in our sesquicentennial year, we've got a lot to talk about.
There's a lot to be proud of.
And we're very proud of it, and i think it's about time that the world knows more about blaine.
We're chomping at the bit, certainly from this end, to get it out there.
It all started with blaine fabin.
He was hired by 30 settlers to lead a wagon-train expedition from philadelphia to california.
Uh, on the 14th night, word has it they were sitting around the campfire, and blaine said,
"do you smell it?
Do you smell the salt in the air?"
He said, "we're here.
I brought you to california."
And so there was a big party that night.
And the next morning, they got up. Uh... they didn't see the ocean because they were in missouri.
Uh, blaine was able to convince them for a little while that it was just low tide and things, but what had happened was that he had made some mistakes.
Bad weather. Wasrt familiar, perhaps, with the proper route.
But as it turns out, everybody was quite happy to be where they were.
So they said, "it's ok we didn't make it to california.
We'll stay here."
And that's why i'm at this desk.
Well, i'm very proud to say that i'm a direct descendant of blaine fabin.
I've lived here all my life.
As did my parents and their parents and their parents and their parents and so on and so forth.
I'm very excited about the show coming up, because it'll be the first time i'll have the experience of sitting in the audience and seeing actors portray my ancestor... the... the actual blaine fabin.
Being a fabin is not always easy.
Um, i can certainly understand how the kennedys feel.
Corky: I had been living in new york and working there as an actor and director and choreographer for 25 years or so, and i really felt i needed a change.
I imagined, in my fantasy, i suppose, that when i came here, i would have a completely different life.
Uh, perhaps, um... a construction worker or one of those guys that works on those high-wire things that, uh... with the hard hat.
You know, that sweeping sort of hat.
And, uh, with the chaps.
But that didn't really work out.
I began to realize, i guess, that the theater was still in my blood, and what i had to do was make use of that, so i offered my services to the high school here, and they accepted, and i began to teach drama.
And within about 6 months, i had formed the blaine community players.
I got to tell you, we are very, very excited about the big show that's happening at the end of the festival.
Everyone right now is just going crazy getting ready to audition.
And unfortunately i won't be able to audition.
We have to stock that day and can't get out of it.
And corky will not let me audition any other time.
So, "that's show business," is what he told me, and, uh, you know, he's the master.
You gotta give him credit for that.
Phil: President mckinley did a whistle-stop tour back in 1898.
And a little boy, jimmy mcbean, made a stool for him.
And he loved it so much that he called back, and said, "lookit, i would like to give more of these to dignitaries who are visiting."
And before you knew it, blaine is manufacturing all these footstools.
And that's how the big... that's how we got the stool boom.
Blaine became the stool capital of the world.
Corky: My first show wasbarefoot in the park, which was an absolute smash, but my production on the stage ofbackdraft was what really got them excited.
This whole idea of in-your-face theater really affected them.
The conceptualization, the whole abstraction, the obtuseness of this production to me was what was interesting.
I wanted the audience to feel the heat from the fire, the fear... because people don't like fire poked, poked in their noses.
You know, when you get a cinder from barbecue right on the end of your nose and you kind of make that little face.
That's not a good thing.
I wanted to have the sense memory of that.
So during the show, i had someone burn newspapers and... and send it through the vents in the theater.
Well, they freaked out.
Of course, the fire marshal came over, and they shut us down for a couple of days.
Ron: Mr. Bluestein, montezuma's revenge is nothing more than good old-fashioned american diarrhea.
Adult diapers should never even enter the picture.
So you lose a few pounds.
My mom used to say that blaine is a little town with a big heart in the heart of a big country.
And, to me, blaine is a kind of town where i can have my own business, meet and marry a wonderful woman like sheila, and... and be something, be somebody.
Some people find it ironical that even though we run a travel agency, we've never been outside of blaine.
Sheila:
With one exception.
Well, we've never been out... you left blaine.
Well, i went to jefferson city once.
It was a... tell them why.
[Sighs]
It was a medical reason.
You can tell 'em.
Just minor surgery.
Libby: I've been working here at the d.q.
For about, um...
8 months, 7.
I don't know.
Something like that.
It's fun.
You just do the cones.
Make sundaes, make blizzards, and... put stuff on 'em and... see a lot of people come in.
A lot of people come to the d.q.
Burgers. Ice cream.
Anything, you know?
Cokes. Just drive in and get a coke, if you're thirsty.
Everybody thinks that roswell was the first sighting of a ufo in the united states, and that's bull roar.
We had the first sighting here in 1946.
And it wasrt just a sighting.
They didn't just fly by.
They stopped. They landed.
The people in blaine went onboard the ship for a potluck dinner.
Ufo expert: I've been coming out to this landing site every day for 2 years to measure it.
And here's the thing... the circumference and the diameter change by a few inches, yet the radius remains the same.
Which brings me back to the number 5.
There are 5 letters in the name "blaine."
Mix the word "blaine" up, mix it around, eventually, you'll get "nebali."
Neball... the name of the planet in a galaxy way, way... way... far away.
I'll tell you another thing.
Once you step inside this circle,
[inales]
The weather never changes.
It is always 67 degrees with a 40% chance of rain.
Always.
Allan: L... i love to make people laugh, and i've been doing it since... you know, school.
People ask me,
"were you a..." you know, "you must have been the class clown."
And i say, uh,
"no, i wasrt."
But i sat beside the class clown, and I... i studied him, and, uh, and saw how he made people laugh.
And so i picked some things up, and, uh, you know, and at parties and family functions, i have to say, i love, you know, breaking people up.
So, there's a thing that i think i got... a... a... an entertaining bug from my grandfather, uh, chaim progot who was very, very big in the yiddish theater back in new york.
He was in the... the very... the sardonically irreverent dybbuk schmybbuk:
I said more ham.
And that revue, i believe, was 1914, and that revue is what made him famous.
Incidentally, the song bubbee made a kishke came from that revue.
My... my father, bless him, brought me into... into the business.
This was his dental practice, uh, before, and i joke with my wife that, uh, you know, at that point, that's when the, uh, the money started rolling in.
You know.
Brave making m-more wampum to buy pelts.
One happy squaw in wigwam.
Happy as mongoose.
That, uh... is, of course, from johnny carson who, uh... one of my heroes in a very funny bit.
Man:?? When i see lips waiting to be kissed??
?? I can't stop??
?? I can't stop??
?? For that lightning, oh, it's striking??
?? Again??
?? Yeah??
?? Lightning's striking??
?? Again and again and again and??
[Coughs]
I'm going to do a scene from the movieraging bull.
You fucked my wife?
What?
You fucked my wife?
How can you ask me a question like that?
How can you ask me?
I'm your brother and you ask me that?
Where do you get the balls big enough to ask me that?
Basically for the last 15 years, i have been the music teacher at blaine high, um, and part of my job, and a very important part is to put on a show every year, which i have done completely by myself.
This year it's going to be different because corky, being from new york, being a professional and having put on some very theatrical productions here, uh, is going to be directing the show this year and i'm going to be the musical director, which is different for me.
[Piano playing]
?? Teacher's pet??
?? I wanna be teacher's pet??
?? I want to be huddled and cuddled??
?? And close to you as i can get??
?? Teacher's pride??
?? I wanna be teacher's pride??
Dr. Pearl! How are you?
Ron albertson.
Yes, ron.
My wife sheila.
You remember her from previous bills.
Hello, sheila.
What are you doing here?
I'm here, you know, trying out for the big show.
Congratulations.
No, why are you here really?
I'm... i told my wife i'd come out for this show.
You know, i thought i'd give it a shot.
Give it your best shot, which won't be the first shot you ever gave.
Hope it doesn't leave corky numb like most of them.
It's like pulling teeth to get a discount from him.
Why don't you give some caramels to the little girl?
Future customers and all.
?? So??
?? I can be teacher's pet??
?? Long after school is through??
?? Teacher, teacher, i love you??
Whoa!
[Piano plays]
?? High??
Ahem. Maybe just... ahhh. Mmm.
?? I dream of jeanie??

Look out!
?? Camptown races sing this song??
?? Doo-dah, doo-dah??

[Exhales]
[Jingling]
?? Floating like??
?? A vapor??
?? On the soft summer??
?? Air??
?? Air??
That was... very nice.
Very good.
Very good.
Corky: Well, thank you, dr. Pearl.
Well, thank you very much.
Corky:
We'll let you know.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
He can actually sing.
He's good.
[Whistles] wow.
Lloyd: The albertsons?
[Piano playing midnight at the oasis]
Ding-dong.
Oh!
I wonder who knows i'm vacationing here at the oasis.
Am i late?
You!
Surprised?
How did you find me?
I have my ways.
Would you like to come in for coffee?
[Loudly]
?? You don't need to answer??
?? There's no need to speak??
?? I'll be your belly dancer??
?? Prancer??
?? And i will be your sheik??
?? I don't need a harem, honey??
?? When you're by my side??
?? And you won't need a camel??
?? No, no??
?? When i take you for a ride??
We'll need some coffee to go with that ride, won't we?
You're always full of surprises.
But, say, i wonder, do we have time for that coffee?
What time is it?
What time is it? Havert you been paying attention?
?? It's??
?? Midnight at the oasis??
Thank you.
Oh... good.
Corky: That was great.
Really good.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks for coming.
Should we leave the...?
Corky: Why don't you put that back there?
Yeah.
Strike it?
We've done a few shows for corky before, so we know all the terms going in.
Thank you.
Thanks so much.
It was really fun.
Thank you.
Lloyd: Thank you.
Corky: Wow.
I'm feeling good about where we stand now with our cast.
I think that the elements, as dr. Watson said to sherlock,
"are coming together, sir."
I'm very excited about ron and sheila, the old standbys, the work horses.
I call them the lunts of blaine.
Allan pearl. Interesting.
How do these... where do they come from?
Sure, i'd seen him around.
It would never have occurred to me to walk up to the dentist and say,
"are you interested in this?"
But i was shopping for my wife bonnie... i buy most of her clothes... and mrs. Pearl was in the same shop.
And it just was an accident.
We started talking about pantyhose.
She was saying... that's not the point of the story, but what the point is was that through this accidental meeting, it's like, you know, it's like a hitchcock movie where you're thrown into a rubber bag and put in the trunk of a car.
You find people.
You find them.
Something. Is it karma?
Maybe.
But we found him, that's the important thing.
And i got bonnie a wonderful pants suit.
They took me off into a separate room.
I seen 'em taking different people off.
Different ones of us off in separate rooms.
They put me on a big white table and, uh, the guy that take me there, the one of them that took me in there to examine me, he probed me.
I was in there i bet more than 3 or 4 hours, in that room being probed.
And at one time or another, there's different ones of them come in,
4, 5, 6 of them at different times, and all of them probed me.
Not all at once, you know.
Individually.
Later on, years later, now even still, it's a funny thing.
It happened on a sunday, and every sunday about the time that i was taken onboard that ship, i find i have no feelings in my buttocks.
Corky:
Casting a show is really only the beginning of the process.
There's also the whole design concept, what fabrics will work for the costumes, the lighting, and it really becomes a wrasslir match, i guess, between me and the muse of theater, and most of all, dance.
[Techno music playing]
Corky: I'd like you to close your eyes now, and i'd like you to try something, all right?
Now, what are you thinking, what are you feeling right now with your eyes closed?
I feel a bree... you're blowing in my ear.
All right, but, see, you jumped to a conclusion.
Oh.
See, what i'm asking for is your first feeling was not that i was blowing on you, it was more like... virgin isles or bahamanian or arubian.
Yes.
Mrs. Pearl:
Yeah, he's at his rehearsal.
He's at his first rehearsal.
I don't know what they're doing
'cause i never been to one before, but i bet they're introducing themselves to each other.
You know, it's gonna be nice to meet some of these new folks,
'cause we don't socialize with the creative types.
We got our scrabble club and stuff, and, um, you know, and other people with babies.
[Drumming and clapping]
Right. Good.
Libby: Oh, the exercises all mean something.
Even if you don't know what.
Dr. Pearl, well, he'll come around, and he'll learn like ron and sheila and i have learned that corky has a vision.
[Drumming]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoo!
Oh!
You!
Forget about it! Ha ha!
Ha ha! I went like this.
Forget about it. Ha ha!
With her it's ok, but with him, he thought... ha ha!
[Sighs]
I, uh, i'm walking on air, you know.
This is a sensation which is... forget it.
When i became a dentist, i thought i was happy, but this is... this is making me nervous now, because i could have wasted a lot of years.
I must say i was very shocked to see that dr. Pearl had actually been cast.
Then i thought... we're in a glamor profession, being travel agents, and he isn't in such a glamorous... one project, we have to loosen him up.
I have a feeling he's a little tight.
Particularly when he's around us probably.
I don't think he'll mind jokes.
You're intimidating, ron... i can't help it.
Because you have so much experience.
Ron is going to help everyone act,
'cause i know ron gives me... well, in all the productions we've been in, and when we do scene studies at home together, ron will have extensive, you know, hour, 2-hour sessions of notes for me, and it's so helpful.
It's notes for both of us.
No, but lately... you get most of them.
He's trying to help me to change my instincts or at least ignore them.
Corky: Listen, let me tell you why i'm here.
We're doing a show.
I won't beat around the bush.
We're doing a show that i've written about the 150th anniversary of blaine, and i know you're an old blainian.
Yes?
And you're really right for one of the parts.
It's the narrator in the show.
One of the actor parts?
Yeah.
Oh, i don't know.
I've heard... i think you're being modest because i've heard you've had some history in show business.
Well, you know i did have, i had a hankering to be an actor when i was a young fella, when i got out of the coast guard, but i went to taxidermy school instead.
Well, i took a correspondence course.
Uh-huh.
I'll tell you something, mr. Wooley, what i'm looking for in my shows are actors and people that are willing to work hard.
Well, yeah, i'm a hard worker as you can see.
I love all the work you've done.
That's a little gun rack made out of deer hooves.
Oh, yeah.
Boy, i didn't know deers could do that.
[Laughs]
Corky: I know this comes out of left field, but i'm looking for another actor.
And i was wondering if you had any interest in participating in the show.
Does that appeal to you in any way?
I'm not much of an actor, i'm sorry.
I've never done that, anything like that before.
Uh-huh.
Ok, fair enough, but it might be interesting, you know, after, uh... do you get off tonight?
What time do you get off tonight?
Well, i get off at 8:00.
At 8:00 tonight?
Yeah.
Really? That's... that's a long day.
Yeah.
Hey, dad, this is, uh, mr... st. Clair.
St. Clair.
He's a drama guy.
Yeah, and, um, at 8:00 you're off, though?
Right.
Yeah.
I have to tell you i'm not much of an actor or singer.
Well, you know what?
That's what charles laughton said.
You know?
And look what happened.
Did you change the fan belt on that blue chevy?
No, i haven't done that yet.
When you get done here, will you get on that?
Yeah.
Um, so, how tall are you?
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Singers:
?? It's all the same??
When we say, "nothing ever happens in blaine," could we try you two singing "blaine," where we really hear the "ne" at the end.
And you guys just go,
"nothing ever happens in blai."
Don't say the "ne."
They say the nes.
And the same thing...
"nothing ever happens, it's all the same."
And you sing,
"it's all the sa."
Let's try it once, ok, jean?
1, 2, 3, and... i know it's hard to jump into this, because it must seem like a, you know... a new world, but we're gonna ease you into it.
And if you ever have any questions, you can always call me up.
I'll give you my... i have a private number.
It's not listed, so don't lose it.
And do not give it out to... to anyone.
"How high a ridge, i could not tell, for the sun, the sun has..." not pinching your shirt.
I want, you see... hook in those thumbs.
Thumbs?
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah.
Just... that's right.
"How high a ridge, i could not tell..." see what's happening with your voice already?
'Cause it's almost as if you're squeezing your boobies out, and it's... it's going to be going out into that audience.
Pushing it right out there.
I could try a "how."
"How... how high a ridge, i could not tell..."
[tambourine playing]
Keep in time.
Ok.
Right.
Robin in the nest.
Ok.
Right.
Good.
This'll dominate the show.
?? By the pool??
?? In the school by the fires of yule??
?? It's the rule??
?? There's a stool, there's a stool??
?? Stools are where??
?? Once upon a time you'd find a chair??
?? A chair's for fools??
?? Everybody wants stools??
?? Stool boom??
?? From the parlor to the pool room??
?? Everyone knows our name?
Whose script is that?
?? Stool...??
Oh, sorry.
No, drool.
?? You will...??
Oh, they're gonna be...
?? Never stopping??
?? Never breathing, working??
[Softly]
I don't want to interfere, but i think it would be... i think we have to work on... i can't hear you.
I think we have to work on the music a little bit more.
Fine.
But i don't want to make trouble, so...
[whispering] and i don't really want to do this in front of them, but i think... where do you want to do it?
Well, i think we have to sit down and make a schedule that includes some... some music time,
'cause i think jean and i have to work... why are you whispering?
I'm right here, you know? I don't... oh, i'm sorry.
Do you want me to talk louder?
Because i think that it would be... well, now it's too loud.
You know, just talk like a normal person, ok?
I think what they were doing was good.
To me, you rehearse, you rehearse.
You get it perfect. You know exactly what you're doing.
And then what?
And then you forget about it.
Let me pinpoint you.
You said they learn it, they forget it, and that's ok?
That's f... great.
Well, they've forgotten it... but they never learned it.
So when did they learn it?
I'm just saying, when do we have the time... but what i'm saying is, if they're gonna forget it anyway, then what difference does it make?
You see what i mean?
It's like one of those... it's like a... it's a zen thing.
It's like, you know... you know, how many babies, you know, fit in... in the tire thing?
That whole... the old joke, you know?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
No, you have a point.
Uh, it's, you know, an interesting point.
Ron: And how'd you find this place?
Allan: Well, we've... we've been, uh... coming here for many, many years.
Oh, yeah, we come every thursday.
Well, with the rehearsals, you won't be able to now.
This is true.
Ron:
You know, in china, they'll kill a monkey at the table and split its head open, eat the brains right out of it.
We had friends... ew.
Barbara and bruce, remember?
Who went to, uh, china, and i'm sure... you're in the travel business... that you've been there, but they went to peking, where they make the ducks, and what they say is that the food over there is not as good... you can't get a sauce as thick and sweet over there.
They don't make it like that.
Their food is like steamed or something.
And they should've called you, because... yeah, we got some good packages.
Incidentally, if you two ever want to get down to miami, miami beach, we got a great package.
A week, 2 weeks.
All expense... yeah.
You get everything you need, any kind of food in blaine. You don't... you know, you get chinese here.
Uh, no need to go... we're talking about miami now, dear.
Yeah, we'd love to go.
We'd love to... is it a direct?
A week, 2 weeks.
Like there aren't chinese people in miami.
Allan: Well, we should.
You know, we've stopped... what does that have to do... of course there are chinese people in miami.
We're talking about china now.
I'm talking about going to miami.
Miami. We're talking about miami now.
Dear, why don't you put some food on your stomach before you have any more wine?
What's it... what's it... shh. Girl talk.
What's it like to be with a circumcised man?
Allan:
That is interesting.
I'd ask you more about that, but ron said...
"that whole jew thing's..." aah.
'Cause when ron had his surgery... all right, all right, all right.
When ron had his surgery, i said,
"hey, circumcise it while you're at it."
'Cause i had never been with anyone else.
Rors the only man i've been with.
Well, what surgery, uh... did he have some major... nothing. I had a little minor corrective surgery.
Could we have some coffee at this table, please?
It's not minor anymore.
[Clears throat]
Allan: Just... well, maybe, you know, we should change the subject.
I had what, you know, most guys would, uh... dream of, you know.
And i had to have, uh, penis-reduction surgery.
Allan: I'm sorry?
Penis reduction.
Which there aren't many.
You're gonna say,
"i never heard of that,"
'cause there haven't been many cases.
I said,
"ron, do something."
And he said, "why don't you get one of those... vagina enlargements?"
Oh, dear! Could we have some coffee over here?
Have you tried the egg rolls?
Unbelievable.
Let me ask you something.
You're a medical man.
Allan: Yes.
I want to ask you something. If you... you... oh! Ohh, for heavers sake! No!
No. No, please.
No! I just want... doctor, please... medicine man not go near dances with stumpy. No.
Corky:
Everybody, everybody, i have a little announcement to make.
I wasrt gonna tell you.
I sent out 10 letters to different producers in new york city.
Ron: That's great.
This is from the oppeneimer organization.
"Dear mr. St. Clair,
"in response to your letter
"re: Blaine, missouri's
150th anniversary
"and the debut of your original musical
"red, white, & blaine,
"the oppeneimer organization
"is delighted to inform you
"that it will be sending a representative,
"mr. Mort guffman,
"to view the production and enlighten us with his comments."
How about that?
"We thank you for the invitation."
And it says, "best regards, samuel oppeneimer jr."
Wow. What does this mean, corky?
What it means is, we may be goir to broadway.
Aah!
Ohh!
Oh, this is great news!
How about that?
Did you hear that?
Libby: My aunt... i brought out her atlas that i look at a lot, this big blue book, and opened up to new york.
And it's an island, is really what it is.
It's this... island full of people of different colors and different ideas, and i can't... it sounds like a lot of fun to me.
You know, we don't see much of that in blaine.
I'd like to maybe meet some guys and... italian guys or... you know, i've watched tv and stuff.
L-i'm gonna be glad to do the show on broadway, and there'll probably be other offers.
Mmm. Keeping our fingers crossed.
But i don't know if the theater and the stage is for me.
For one thing, there's an awful lot of memorizing of lines, and i think... and i think... you know what i'm thinking.
Yeah. That's always been in your way.
The ultimate goal... hollywood.
Even when i was a kid doing my impressions...
[imitating humphrey bogart]
"Here's looking at you, babe."
And, uh...
[imitating henry fonda]
"You don't care about anyone but yourself."
Who was that?
Henry fonda.
I always have to tell her who i'm doing.
She always laughs,
"now, who is that?"
But i think, back there, there's always the germ in my mind that that's where i'd end up... on the silver screen.
And you got the face for it, too, darlir.
You know, i want to try that "less is more" kind of acting, where you just... when you're talking to someone, you close your eyes, and then you look at them when you're not talking to the person.
I mean, you open your eyes when you're looking away, but then when you talk to the person, you go like that.
And you open your eyes, and then you look back at the person, but you never open your eyes when you're talking to them.
Corky: The guffman news is really big, and, uh, i don't truthfully think that the cast understand how big.
Um, they don't know the new york thing.
They haven't been through it, and i have.
You know, so it is kind of on my shoulders, and... going to the big apple for the first time, you know, is... such an experience.
You never forget it.
It stays with you for your whole life.
Me, you know, right out of the navy, you know, fresh off a destroyer, uh, with a dance belt and a tube of chapstick, basically.
You know, not really much to call my own.
And then basically being slammed down for 10 or so years, you know, off off off off broadway, and then enough is enough, ok? I get the joke.
And... is that gonna happen again? I don't know.
I mean, and i don't want it to happen again.
In my deepest, deepest of hearts, i do not want it to happen again.
Mr. Guffman brings with him... a reputation, something bigger than anyone in this town has ever known, and if i am to get back to new york city on my terms, i cannot deliver him... a stinky product.
I really have to be presenting him a package.
A beautifully wrapped, glossy, sweet-smelling show.
What i need from you... because you're the bosses of the town, essentially, and i know that... is... this is so hard.
I mean, there's nothing easy about this.
This is like when you're getting your legs waxed, and they whip that thing off real fast.
That's what this is like.
I need more money.
Steve:
How much do you need?
Steve's right. How much are you thinking of, now?
Ok. [sighs]
What i need... is 100,000.
Oh, brother!
Corky!
He is good.
He is.
Corky:
And let me explain, let me explain what... go ahead.
Oh, man, my heart stopped for a second there.
He started going "money" and the whole guffman thing.
Let me just explain really what that entails.
I bought it all the way, by the way.
Steve: He's not joking.
He's serious, glenn.
Glenn:
He's... he's not kidding?
Steve: Corky, our entire budget for the entire year is $15,000 for everything, and that includes swimming.
Well, i don't have any swimming in my show.
No, no. I mean the pool.
We have to keep up the pool.
That's everything.
The entire year is 15,000.
Look, you're a nice fella and all, glad you're here, but if i may be blunt... what's wrong with you?
[Chuckling]
I mean...
[sighs]
So what i'm understanding here, correct me if i'm wrong, is that you're not giving me any money.
So now i'm left basically with nothing.
I'm left with zero, in which... in which... what can i do with zero?
You know, what can I... i can't do anything with it.
This is my life here we're talking about.
We're not just talking about, you know, something else.
We're talking about my life, you know?
And it's forcing me to do something i don't want to do... to leave, to... to go out and just leave and go home and say... make a clean cut here and say, "no, way, corky.
You're not putting up with these people."
And i'll tell you why i can't put up with you people.
Because you're bastard people.
That's what you are.
You're just bastard people, and i'm going home, and i'm gonna... i'm gonna bite my pillow is what i'm gonna do!
[Door slams]
Sheila: What do you use on your skin?
Libby: Vaseline.
Petroleum jelly on your skin? Yeah.
You are getting away with murder, libby.
You're young and it's ok, but have i told you... libby, i have an announcement.
I have to talk to you.
Excuse me, libby.
I have to talk to you.
I'm gonna round us up.
Hold on. Gee.
Dr. Pearl.
Morning.
Good morning.
We have an announcement.
We have to talk. Ok?
Gather around, please.
Gather around.
Libby! Sheila.
Excuse me, ron.
Thank you. Dr. Pearl.
Please be quiet.
I have an announcement.
We've got to listen up here.
Excuse me, are we gonna be vocalizing?
We will be vocalizing.
Before we start, i'd like to clear my throat.
[Pfft]
Yes, we'll be doing... we'll be vocalizing.
We'll be doing a lot of... excuse me, please!
Everybody, let's be serious now just for a moment, and let's all listen up, ok?
Corky has left the show, and i am taking over.
And what i want to do today is start with some music, do dancing, and work on our lines.
And my hope is at the end of 5 days, we will know what we're doing... what do you mean?
And we will have a show.
Corky's left?
Ron: You mean he's left for today or permanently?
Corky has quit the show, and it's my show.
Corky!
Ron:
Cork!
Corky!
Here, you go up.
Boy, i only do that twice a day, that's good exercise.
You know, most athletic injuries... is he not answering?
Corky, we love you!
Corky, open up!
Allan: Corky!
Sheila: Corky, we love you!
We want you to live!
There may be something wrong.
Try the door.
Is the door unlocked?
[Mariachi music playing]
He wants to be alone right now.
I'd never forgive myself if something was wrong.
Just shut up! Just shut up!
Jesus christ!
Libby: Freaks!
Freaky people, my god!
Sheila: I know how he feels, too!
Guess i can just go back to the dairy queen, you know.
They said they'd take me back.
[Train horn blows in distance]
I always have a place at the dairy queen.
You got to stop crying.
She hasn't cried this much since the day we got married. Honestly.
You know, this is wonderful.
Why didn't i react like this when i was playing football for the blaine panthers and our quarterback went down with a dislocated knee?
I should have said,
"time-out!"
'Cause you're strong, ron, you're strong.
You're just a big brick!
Let's delay the game, and my lip would tremble, and i see we have an injured quarterback.
Let's give up. No.
You know what we did?
We brought in the second-string quarterback.
When he went down, we brought in the third-string quarterback, and we went out, and we whipped the pants off of harry truman high school, and next week, went out and mopped the floor with blessed, uh, heart of mary.
And they went on to win the state championship.
Allan: To tell you the truth, i haven't even thought about it.
Not for a... not for a second have i even dwelled on the fact that the show's over.
I don't, uh, i don't, uh, think about it.
L... i try not to think about it, and therefore, i, you know, don't, because it's a very healthy way to deal with something that is ultimately not that important in the long run.
It's not... not, uh, not important at all, you know, for me.
I'm just so sad for corky, you know, i mean... i think these creative people, they're real emotional, and, um... i think the important thing about show-biz people is that you got to have a-another life.
And I... i know, you know, uh, he's... he's got a wife.
I guess she's out of town.
Um... because i haven't seen her.
I've never seen her, so, you know, that could be the problem.
You know, maybe she's just not supportive.
Glenn: Corky, without you, there's no show.
Without the show, there's no celebration.
Without celebration, there's no blaine.
So you see how it's a domino effect.
You know how dominoes do that.
Without blaine, i got news for you, there's no missouri.
Blaine is the heart of missouri.
What happens if missouri goes down? You tell me.
Steve: We need the magic back in the show, is what we need, and it ain't gonna happen with lloyd.
Lloyd is a music teacher, and he shops at walmart.
He doesn't even support the town.
The person who needs you the most... is blaine fabin.
Steve: Hear, hear.
And i'm not just saying that because i am a fabin.
Ok, ok.
I'm saying that because i just know that nobody can touch, um... that whole... thing.
That whole thing, hmm?
Steve: You could take a nickel, and you could make it into a million dollars, because this man is a genius, and we cannot lose that.
Look what you did withbarefoot when you came to this town.
Did you have any budget then?
You didn't have
$100,000 then, and look what happened to that show.
And what aboutbackdraft?
You took a little bit of cellophane, and you made it into flames!
You can still feel the heat.
You know what?
You're not wrong.
Steve: We need you to take your magic wand... and wave it and make this town special again, is what we need.
Glenn:
Will you do it?
Come on back, cork.
Please.
[Applause]
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yay!
Thank you.
Yay!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Please! Oh!
Whoo!
All right, thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ok, let's pretend that it never happened, ok?
And let's just jump intocovered wagons.
All right? Let's start from the dance part.
Covered wagons!
Whoo!
Waah!
Corky: In a funny way, what the city council did was really give me a challenge, and it's a challenge that i am going to accept.
It's like in the olden days and the days in france when men would slap each other with their gloves, and say, you know,
"d'artagnan, you know, how dare you talk to me like that, you!"
And smack 'im.
Cast:?? Stool boom??
?? From the parlor to the pool room??
?? We're the center of a stool boom??
?? Everyone knows our name?
?? Working, making??
?? Never stopping, never sleeping??
?? Working, building??
?? Some for selling, some for keeping??
?? You will drool??
?? At the splendor of these magic stools??
?? It's the rule??
?? Everyone has a stool??
?? Just 3 legs??
?? It's the thing for which a monarch begs??
?? Hock your jewels??
I did want to mention one thing.
Mm-hmm?
Specs?
1845, you know, i think it's a little problem.
Oh, oh, oh.
My glasses.
You're saying... i don't think you should wear them.
Don't wear them in the show?
It's mostly in covered wagons, because i think that's the one where it's just not as believable.
Of course, when you get further up in time, historically, it's... i can see a couple of problems.
Nothing major. Nothing that we can't solve.
One, um... contrary to public opinion, i don't see very well without my glasses, so i'm thinking is that going to be a problem for me... just look out.
And the other thing which is also a problem is i have a very lazy eye which these prescription glasses help correct.
Woman:
?? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and...??
Chorus:
?? Blue sky, blue sea??
?? Blue grass, blue tree??
?? Red as the fire in our hearts??
?? That makes this country strong??
?? Red as the fire in our hearts??
?? That helps us sing this song??
Allan: Getting off the horse is not a problem.
I can get off the horse like that, but where i'm having a problem is that sometimes the horse comes out and i can't get past the cow.
So i have to kind of do this when i come out.
"Gather round, for i have news."
I don't know which is more lifelike, the horse or dr. Pearl.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
You.
Corky?
Here's the phone.
It's johnny.
Allan: I feel like a hero... hello?
Yeah?
What do you mean?
Ron: Then we back up.
But i've been waiting for you to turn around... corky:
What are you saying?
Libby: Shh!
I understand that.
No, i understand.
Believe me, i do understand.
What can you do is just say absolutely not!
Do you understand that?
I don't believe that.
No, i'm sorry.
I do not accept that.
That is not an answer, no.
It's absolutely unacceptable that you would say this now.
Not today! No!
And that's the way it is?
Then i just hate you!
And i hate your ass face!
What's up?
Oh, corky.
Johnny's not in the show.
His dad said he has to go back to work.
What does he think this is, school, that he can be marked absent one day?
This is the day of the show, y'all.
Oh, my god.
Just... just... ron: This is very strange.
Ron, just... just let me think for a second, all right?
I've just got to take a breath here and... and try to figure this out, all right?
Corky: It's tight.
That hurts.
If you could hike it up a little bit you'd get more room.
I am pulling them up.
Sort of trying to commit to one side here, dear.
This is johnny's costume, and johnny is a lot... he's a different body type than you are.
This is... i don't... i'm worried... i'm about
5 inches away... i understand.
Woman: Actors, we're at 15 minutes.
Oh, my god!
Aah!
We're at 15.
No, we gotta move now.
Come on.
You're gonna have to help me here.
Ok, ok.
Help me here!
I'm so nervous.
You're gonna be great.
If there's an empty space, just say a line.
That's what i like to do.
Even if it's from another show.
[Tuning instruments]
Agnes, where's the lilac dress?
You mean the purple one?
Yes. Where is it?
Honey, i told you to lay off the hot fudge sundaes.
I couldn't let the seams out.
It's not here?
Not it is not.
Hello, sweetheart.
[Music starts]
Oh, i destroyed my makeup!
Ron: Mmm. Hark!
A rider approaches!
Sheila: Oh, god!
Cooley: It's all right.
Just... careful.
I hope that isn't too hot.
No, no, it's just fine.
[Western music begins]
May i remind you, please?
No glasses for the first number.
Oh, no, no, no, I... actors?
We're at places.
Have a good show everybody!
Break a leg!
Don't worry about anything
'cause it's gonna all roll... he's not here.
He's not here.
What?
Sheila: Ron:
Not here? Guffman?
Should we lower the curtain?
Corky!
Everybody, look, look, i've been through this a million times.
These new york types like to come late.
Believe me. I've never seen one of them come on time in all my years in the theater.
Take a deep breath... blow it out.
He's gonna be here.
Let's just do a good show, ok?
Everybody do a good show.
Hands in the middle.
All: Wwwwwhoa!
[Applause]
Oh, howdy.
Eh, didn't see you sneak up on me there.
But if you like, you're welcome to share my campfire with me.
I was just fixing to get me some grub.
Beans.
[Chuckles] mmm.
I love beans.
Big, fat, hot juicy beans.
Now, don't get me going on beans or i'll be jabberir away till the sun comes up.
[Laughter]
But, you know, now that i've got your ear, there is a story i wouldn't mind sharing with you.
It's a tall tale that grows taller with each passing year.
It's the story of blaine.
[Western music starts]
[Applause]
[Whip cracks]
Well, we've traveled long and far today.
We must let the women and children rest.
Don't you rest on our account, daniel potter.
We women are just as strong and resilient as you men.
Ha ha ha!
I do believe you are, rebecca.
I do believe you are.
California will be a sight for these weary eyes.
Mine as well, rebecca, mine as well.
But right now we need a campfire to warm our souls and to cook our food.
Done.
Oh.
Oh.
That will be quite enough of that, billy whittaker.
Just one kiss?
There'll be plenty of time for kissing when we get to california. lfwe get to california.
Oh, we'll get there.
Blaine fabin will lead us there.
Hark! A rider approaches.
Blaine fabin returns!
Allan: Whoa!
Ho there!
Whoa, steady.
Gather round for i have news.
Ron: What news?
What did your keen and perceptive eyes behold?
Just up yonder, there is a ridge.
How high a ridge, i could not tell, for the sun had set and darkness fell before i reached its pinnacle.
Then... a strange thing happened.
My nose started twitchir.
There was a mysterious scent in the night air.
What? What kind of scent?
What was this mysterious scent?
It was the scent of salt water!
Oh!
Salt water!
Salt water?
[Mumbling]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our destination!
We have reached the pacific!
Welcome to california!
Yay!
Yay!
[Playing square dance music]
?? Grab your feller by the hand??
?? Welcome him to the promised land??
?? Grab your lady by the arm??
?? Take her out behind the barn??
[Fiddling]
Everybody dance!
Whoo!
[Clapping]
[Cheering]
That was great!
Shut up.
I can't believe... oh, my!
60 years went by, and the town of blaine kept a-growir and a-changir.
Every time you looked around, a new house was going up, a new family was moving in.
Hurry, agnes.
I am trying to hurry.
There we go.
Libby: You got my hat?
Where's my hat?
Agnes: Your hat? Right here is your hat, darling.
Mcgillicuddy's orchard became the blaine elementary school.
They even laid track for that newfangled invention, the iron horse, which brought a pretty important visitor to blaine.
[Train whistle blows]
Corky: Yay!
It's president mckinley!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Good people of blaine, they told me my next stop was wichita, but i said,
"what about blaine?"
Yay!
Hurrah!
I guess i need a new travel agent.
[Laughter]
Mr. President, in honor of our visit... yourvisit toourtown, i present you humbly with this fair key to our city.
Well, i do declare, i believe the key to this city is larger than the city itself.
[Laughter]
Corky:
Wait, mr. President!
What have we here?
It's a footstool.
I make them.
Well, isn't that interesting?
I'll take this back to washington with me, and every time i rest my feet i'll think of blaine.
Yay!
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Now, we all know that politicians aren't used to keeping their word... he's here.
He's here.
I told you he was gonna come.
Should we start over again?
Sheila: He didn't see covered wagons!
Well, before you know it, everyone rich and poor alike had to have a blaine stool in their home.
The little town never knew what hit it.
Footstool factories sprouted up like toadstools.
Everyone had a good job, everyone was making a good wage.
Blaine was on the map.
?? By the pool??
?? In the school, by the fires of yule??
?? It's the rule??
?? There's a stool, there's a stool??
?? Stools are where??
?? Once upon a time you'd find a chair??
?? A chair's for fools
?? Everybody wants stools??
?? Stool boom??
?? From the parlor to the pool room??
?? We're the center of a stool boom??
?? Everyone knows our name?
?? Working, building??
?? Never stopping, never sleeping??
?? Working, making??
?? Some for selling, some for keeping??
?? You will drool??
?? At the splendor of these magic stools??
?? It's the rule??
?? Everyone has a stool??
?? Just 3 legs??
?? It's a thing for which a monarch begs??
?? Hock your jewels??
?? Use the money for stools
?? Stool boom??
?? Just 3 legs and watch the sales zoom??
?? Like a fever, it's a stool boom??
?? And it's spreading out from blaine??
?? Working, building??
?? Never stopping, never sleeping??
?? Working, making??
?? Some for selling, some for keeping??
?? Working, building??
?? Never stopping, never sleeping??
?? Working, making??
?? Some for selling??
?? Some for keeping??
All: Whew.
[Applause]
[Cheering]
[Crowd chattering]
Mrs. Pearl: I can't wait to see the second half.
Allan, his dramatic work... i mean, i knew he was funny, and i knew he could move, dance,
'cause he's that way, but i think his dramatical work is so moving that, um... well, i mean, i called joyce and i said,
"joyce, bring joshie 'cause i gotta feed him halftime
'cause i'm just busting."
This is good.
Boy, they're moving.
They're dancing all over the place and the songs are very catchy.
Uh, very catchy.
Can't get a few of them out of my head.
Almost to an annoying point, but i think it's good when a song is catchy.
From the little experience i have in show business.
I knew corky that could act and direct and produce, but who knew he was going to act and sing and dance?
You know, he can just do everything there is to do, and there's only one other person in the world that can do that and that's barbra streisand.
He is... [sighs]
I don't know.
An inspiration to this town.
That's... that's what he is.
And i, for one, am very glad to see that johnny savage dropped out of the show, because a couple years ago, he came into the drugstore and he tried to steal my stamp machine, and that kid is no good.
You could tell just by his parents he's no good, and he would not have added anything to this show.
Where corky on the other hand...
Iook at him! Did you see... god, i wish i was in the show!
[Music playing]
I hear that french girls... are very pretty.
That they wear the finest of clothes.
I also hear that they are experts in the ways of love.
Ima, i'm going to fight for my country.
To fight, and yes, perhaps die so that young men from here to timbuktu can feel the wind of freedom blowing through their hair.
Oh, monty, i didn't mean to doubt you.
It's just sometimes i feel as if i don't really know you.
I would still pay.
?? A penny for your thoughts??
?? A dime for your dreams??
?? Would a shiny new quarter??
?? Buy a peek at your schemes???
?? And when you are away??
?? So far from my side??
?? I will cherish my penny's won'th??
?? Till at last i'm your bride??
?? A penny for your thoughts??
?? Let's call it a deal??
?? I don't have any secrets??
?? You know how i feel??
That's it. No, no.
Hey, here.
Where?
You know where i like the curl.
Ron, i have to get myself ready.
There it is. Nice.
Now, a little fluff here and you can work on yourself.
?? A penny for your thoughts??
?? It's settled and done??
?? I'd have offered a million??
?? I'd have done it for none??
?? I reckon we're in love??
?? And married we'll be??
?? And all for a penny??
?? A bright copper penny??
?? The penny that brought you??
?? To me??
[Applause]
It was so good.
I told you you'd be able to lift me like that.
Ha ha! You were right!
You lifted me up!
Yes, after our brave fighting boys returned from the war, things got back to normal in blaine.
Until one summer night in 1946, when unexpected visitors put us back on the map.
Ron:
Where are we?
Libby:
How did we get here?
Is this a dream?
[All gasp]
Look, what is it?
I don't know.
It looks like one of them new feed storage bins.
That ain't no feed storage bin!
How did it get here?
It must've flew!
But it don't have any wings.
Then i guess it just dropped... from somewhere up there.
Alien:
Citizens of blaine, do not be alarmed.
We will not harm you.
We come in peace from a planet far, far away.
A place we call mars.
I've heard of mars.
Where's that?
Alien: Stand back and your queries will be answered.
[All gasping]
Libby: Look out!
[Thunk]
[Audience laughing]
What do you want from us?
A good question, earthling.
It seemed like it was time for a change.
Time to take a trip to see the exciting places in the galaxy.
For you see...
?? Nothing ever happens on mars??
?? No sports or entertainment??
?? Or swinging bars??
?? You stand around??
?? You stand some more??
?? On a planet named for a roman god of war??
?? Nothing ever happens on mars??
?? No supersonic airplanes?
?? No sporty cars??
?? The sun comes up??
?? The sun goes down??
?? You can't go to the country??
?? You can't go to town??
?? Boring, boring??
?? Boring, boring??
?? Boring, boring??
?? Boring??
[Cheering]
Well, the town of blaine has packed a lot in the last 150 years.
We've had our ups and we've had our downs.
We've seen our past and we look forward to the future.
And when the challenges come, we'll greet them the way americans always do, with grit, determination, and pride.
Because that, my friends, isamerica.
And nothir says america more to me than blaine!
[Cheering]

Aah! Corky!
Corky!
Mmm! You're so brilliant!
You're brilliant!
Cliff, you're great.
Everyone is so great!
Ohh, dr. Pearl!
Corky, you did it!
Thank you! Mmm!
I'm going to get mr. Guffman.
I'll be right backstage.
It was great.
Hello, how are you?
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
And you, too.
Boffo socko, corky.
Thank you so much, mr. Mayor.
Wait'll they hear about this at the next mayor's conference.
Thank you so much.
I know we have a lot of work to do, the first act needs... that was magic.
Thank you very much, steve.
God!
Thank you so much.
Which we've got... the first act, it's just up and down.
Kind of dipping in and out, and i know that, just don't have the time to do everything.
So, i'm gonna ask you point-blank... do we have a shot to go to broadway?
Yes, i think so.
Ohh, mamma mia!
That is such good news.
Oh, i can't tell you what news that is to me.
Would you like to meet the cast?
I'd like that, yeah.
Oh, great.
Come on with me, you.
Ohh!
Mr. Pro!
Wonderful job.
You, too.
That blaine... corky: Everybody!
Ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Our cast.
Thank you.
You were just great.
Oh ho ho!
Well, i'd like... please, introduce yourselves.
Sheila... sheila albertson.
I was?
You were great.
Mrs. Ron albertson.
I'm ron albertson.
It's a pleasure to perform for someone... this came a couple hours ago.
I'm sorry i'm just now getting it to you.
Oh, thank you, sweetie.
Clifford wooley.
Mr. Wooley.
Nice to meet you.
Allan pearl.
You... you make me laugh.
Oh, it's a delight to meet you, sir.
Well, i'm sure that mr. Guffman would like to say a few words to us.
Hear, hear!
Corky: Speech, speech, speech!
I think there's some mistake.
My name is loomis.
Roy loomis.
I'm down from deming.
I came down, my niece had her first baby.
Yeah, it's a boy.
That's what the balloon is for.
I just wanted to tell you how just absolutely wonderful you all were.
And thank you. And i'll be seeing you.
And bless you.
He's gonna love this.
[Laughs] oh, boy.
Allan: Take our makeup off. Ahem.
"Snowstorm in new york.
"All flights canceled.
Mort guffman."
[Pops cork]
Allan: I think the one really important thing that i learned uh, from my whole experience in working with corky, is that i do indeed have talent.
And a couple of things, actually.
"B"...i have to entertain.
I have to entertain.
And you have to go where you are needed, you have to go where the crowds are, and you have to go where the love is.
And the love, for me, right now is in miami.
Not blaine.
?? My bubbee made a kishke??
?? She made it big and fat??
?? My sadie took one look at it??
?? And said,
"i can't eat that!"
?? Oh, mama, mama, mama
?? Oh, mama, me, oh, my
Ron: Well, here we are in the land of dreams, and don't let anybody tell you dreams can't come true.
We're an hour from the snow, we're 20 minutes from the ocean,
2 hours from the mexico.
5 hours from vegas.
And we're gonna get there one of these days.
Soon as we get a car.
We don't have a car yet. Who wants to add to the pollution?
We consider ourselves bl-coastal if you consider the mississippi river one of the coasts.
Woman: Extras, let's go.
Over here.
All right. Time to get back to work.
That's what they're paying us for.
Can't they even refer to us by name?
Why can't they say,
"ron, sheila, we're this way, please"?
Still the same paycheck, honey. How you doing?
All right.
You're doing a great job, incidentally.
Face towards the camera and smile.
Are you gonna smile?
I think we should have a line.
I gave him some suggestions.
He didn't want to hear... we should be line-dancing.
That's a great idea.
Director:
Quiet, please!
Get your finger up.
Keep smiling.
Director:
Quiet, please.
Libby: I was on my way to new york, and then my dad got out of prison.
Which is good.
He was supposed to be in there for 10 years, but i guess since he didn't kill anybody, he just... ruined some property, that they let him out after 5.
So, it's... i'm here with my dad.
And, um... i've been thinking of ice cream and stuff and what i could do with it.
Maybe... we have a blizzard and we have a breeze.
We have derbies.
The derbies are really old.
They've been doing derbies... the chocolate dip... for, i think 20 years or something.
I really want to sort of make a healthy low-fat or non-fat, um... healthy... blizzard.
Corky:
The first thing i did when i moved back to new york city, was to look up mr. Guffman.
And he was so sweet, and i think he felt a little guilty, too, because he's offered me the chance to audition for his new broadway show which is a revival ofmy fair lady.
It's one of my favorite shows of all time.
And the role is of 'enry 'iggins, the somewhat- stern-taskmaster- but-he-really-likes-her- anyway-kind-of-thing guy who teaches eliza to speak correctly.
And she of course is of the cockney persuasion and drops her hs.
And i've been working on that at home, the whole cockney thing of,
"'ello, 'ow are 'oo?"
"Do you want to go to 'artford?"
"Not live in this 'ell'ole."
And that kind of thing.
I think i'm honing in on it pretty close now.
And i suppose that the cake-and-eat-it-too part of this whole story is that another dream of mine has come true, which is that i've gotten to open this shop... where i have all my show business treasures and all my memorabilia.
This is without a doubt, one of my favorite items.
Um, my dinner with andre action figures, and what you can do, which is so cute, is you can reenact the whole scene.
You know, where the two guys talk to each other and say, you know...
"boy, i'm sure glad you found a good restaurant.
"You know, it's so hard these days to get in.
Who do you know?"
"Oh, i just called.
Made a call.
Spur of the moment."
"Ha ha! Oh, you, you can always get a reservation."
You know.
That's not from the movie, but you can make up your own dialogue, which is one of the great things about action figures.
I'm trying to get... it's very rare... the one... the action figures fordas boot,
'cause i love to do that whole claustrophobic thing inside the sub where they're, you know,
"das kande, das mushtenstein."
That whole german thing.
Can't speak german, but it sounds like sort of a bunch of barnyard animals,
"muck, muck, muck," making that noise and sweatir.
Uh, over here, these are my big heads, i call 'em, starting with anthony michael hall, one of the brat packers.
In fact, in the background there, there's andrew mccan'thy.
Over here, some new lunchboxes we've gotten in, the remains of the day lunchbox, and the kids, they're just having such a good time with these, you know.
Kids don't like eating lunch at school, but if they're got aremains of the daylunchbox, they're a whole lot happier.

"Ludwig van Beethoven, the man who inherited... and increased the immortal fame of Handel and Bach... of Haydn and Mozart, is now no more.
He was an artist, and who will stand beside him?
He was an artist... and what he was, he was only through music.
The thorns of life had wounded him deeply... so he held fast to his art... even when the gate through which it entered was shut.
Music spoke through a deafened ear to he who could no longer hear it.
He carried the music in his heart.
Because he shut himself off from the world, they called him hostile.
They said he was unfeeling... and called him callous.
But he was not hard of heart.
It is the finest blades that are most easily blunted... bent or broken.
He withdrew from his fellow man after he had given them everything... and had received nothing in return.
He lived alone... because he found no second self.
Thus he was, thus he died.
Thus he will live for all time".
Which one of you is the thief?
Huh?
Produce the money, or I will have you arrested!
Then arrest me!
I took him in when nobody could bear his company!
And now you want to get paid, eh?
- Bank shares.
- Give them to me!
The money is mine!
Here. Here is his will.
"I declare that my brothers
Caspar and Johann... are the heirs to my fortune, if so it can be called".
As Caspar is long dead, that leaves me! Just me!
Well, give me my money!
Answer!
This is his final testament.
What?
"All my music and all the capital of my estate.. shall go to my sole heir, my immortal beloved".
Signed, "Ludwig van Beethoven".
A letter is enclosed.
- This is...
- Come on, now.
Don't keep me in suspense.
Who is it?
- Nobody.
- Oh, not so.
The letter bears no name.
"To my immortal beloved".
"My angel, my all, my other self".
The maestro was nursing a secret passion.
I never heard such words from his lips.
Who could this be?
The only love he held was for himself.
I suffered his insults, his temper.
I suffered in silence when he spat the food I made back in my face.
That money is ours!
It is not.
It doesn't matter anymore.
He is gone.
We have his music.
Destroy this letter.
It would only show his disordered life to the world.
It's his dying wish.
We owe him at least that.
You have no authority in this matter.
I have his authority.
Still the faithful dog, eh?
He was my friend.
What friend would be so cruel?
What brother so uncaring?
You know nothing of my brother!
Take me to Karlsbad.
"My angel, my all, my other self.
Just a few words today and that in pencil, yours.
Only tomorrow will I know for certain where I am to stay.
A worthless waste of time and such.
Why this deep sorrow?
If we could be united, we would feel this pain no longer".
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, Frau...
Streicher.
- Herr Schindler.
- Let me find your reservation.
I'm afraid I don't have a reservation.
Oh, no matter. We have always room for a gentleman such as yourself.
Is this the address for this hotel?
One moment.
Ja, of course.
Do you know the name
Ludwig van Beethoven?
- The composer?
- Yes.
I knew him.
- Did he ever stay here?
- Are you a policeman?
Then I will not answer your questions.
Oh, please, I'm trying to conclude his affairs.
Ah, van Beethoven is dead.
Alas, yes.
Best thing for him.
He was a terrible man.
Then he stayed here?
A long time ago.
Too long to remember.
I can remember only the damage.
The damage?
I was never paid for the damage.
He smashed it all up, everything.
There was a chair, three florins.
Window, five.
- I had to paint everything.
- Frau Streicher.
Would this be sufficient?
There was a woman.
We had been expecting
Herr van Beethoven for days.
She came instead.
She said he was to join her.
She registered in his room.
Under what name? illegible. Then... there was this terrible storm, a deluge.
The woman hid in her room... waiting.
Ashamed to show her face,
I'd say.
And then, the letter arrived.
You opened the letter.
I had to. How else would I know who it was for?
I only read his signature.
"My angel, my all, my other self.
Just a few words... and that in pencil..."
I sent it to her room at once.
She can't have liked what she read.
She left at once, right away.
Left without a word to anybody.
And then, of course,
Herr van Beethoven arrives.
When he found she was gone, he went mad.
He was like a madman.
Threw a chair out of the window.
I called the police.
I was frightened of him.
Herr van Beethoven!
Open up!
Here is her signature.
Is that a "J" or a "G"?
It looks more like an "A" to me.
She was haughty like a countess.
What did she look like?
Never got a proper look at her.
I don't think she wanted to be recognized.
Herr Schindler.
Lock the door.
But, Countess...
Lock the door.
We must not be disturbed.
Not everything they say about me is true.
Holz was here with the other one, the weasel.
Johann.
How could Luigi have such a vile brother?
I hope they were in good health.
They say you have stolen Luigi's money.
They thought you would come here.
Why?
I told them nothing.
The price for my silence is that you must tell me everything.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
It falls upon me to interrogate you.
Why should I submit to that?
That is what he wanted.
Who?
The maestro.
What I shall tell you will never leave this room?
On my word of honor, Contessa.
There is substance to the rumors.
I was the great love of Luigi's life.
I first heard the name
Beethoven when I was 17.
I had heard that his music aroused such passion as to be dangerous.
Some thought it obscene and unsuitable for the young.
I wrote to my cousins,
Theresa and Josephine.
They lived in Vienna, the great music capital of the world.
Surely they would know more.
Indeed they did.
They knew him intimately.
More intimately than they admitted at the time.
Most nights I dreamt of him.
And then,
Father was posted to Vienna.
We were invited to Prince Lichnowsky's palace for a musical evening.
Beethoven was going to be there.
I knew he must be so noble... so refined in feeling, so cultured.
I could hardly wait.
I was going to hear him play.
That music affected me like none I had ever heard before.
And as for Beethoven...
I was soon overcome.
I feared I might faint.
Hello.
Oh. I didn't see you.
I have to go back.
Oh, you are leaving me to listen to that ass... who plays like a kitchen maid, all clipped and staccato.
This music is beautiful.
I was told that the Viennese had superior taste.
Clearly in your case, it is not true.
You must be Julia Guicciardi.
I hear there's quite a contest for your charms.
Sir, you're rude and offensive.
I'm leaving.
- Do you play the piano?
- What?
I intend to be your teacher.
I shall call for you tomorrow at 10:00.
You shall be barred from the house.
I could not believe the outrage.
This ugly man, surely a servant, had called at the front door.
I have an appointment.
She has a piano.
A gentleman is here to see you.
He says he's your new music teacher.
Father, there has been a mistake.
This man is a common oat.
He accosted me last night.
Send him away at once.
I will not! It would be a shame on our household.
Sir?
May i present Ludwig van Beethoven?
So you must attend my next recital.
I heard you last week.
I remember.
The music was beautiful.
Surely not that bad.
I found the playing exquisite.
It's that damned Beethoven
I can't stand.
People only claim to admire his stuff so as not to seem ignorant.
My dear husband, don't confirm your stupidity in front of the guests.
We all speak frankly here.
Tell us your opinion.
Heavens, no.
I was not looking for flattery.
It was too clipped and staccato.
There was not enough singing tone.
Julia, as you can see, is being taught by the maestro himself.
What?
He comes every day to the house.
Every day?
Is that wise?
Why do you say that?
He's a harsh teacher.
He's a scoundrel and a republican.
It is even said that he is a follower of Napoleon.
He'd have us all in the arms of Madame La Guillotine.
He travels in polite society on his reputation as a virtuoso... but flies into a fit if anyone... even dares suggest he sit at the keyboard.
Why will he no longer play?
Beethoven is a strange and obstinate man.
He says it makes him feel like a servant... and he serves no masters.
But he takes the money.
You think because I did not stop you that I am not listening.
A mistake is nothing.
But the fact that you thump out the notes... without the least sensitivity to their meaning is unforgivable.
And your lack of passion is unforgivable.
I shall have to beat you.
I am writing a new symphony.
It will cause a scandal because of its subject.
- Tell me.
- Here. Take my arm.
They should make way for us, not us for them!
Their days are over.
Your world is finished!
Oh, shut up!
When I was a boy, they would have had you arrested for less.
But now they are scared of what is happening in France.
- You know why wigs went out of fashion?
- Why?
Because too many ended up in the bottom of baskets.
But I am a countess, too, Luigi.
They are scared.
Scared of Napoleon.
That is why Napoleon is the subject of my symphony.
I have here a proposal of marriage.. from a composer.
- Count Gallenberg.
- Oh.
You were thinking of Beethoven?
Julia, the gossip is everywhere.
- He also has proposed.
- Then there is no contest.
- You love Beethoven?
- Yes.
I cannot give my consent.
We are not wealthy, Julia.
He is a man without rank, fortune or permanent engagement.
His character and temperament are so peculiar that I doubt... any would find happiness with him.
- He's a genius.
- Perhaps.
But in the last year he has not played nor published a single note.
There are those who say there is some infirmity that prevents him.
Untrue gossip! Lies!
Has he played for you?
We made a bargain. If I could prove Luigi could still play...
Father would give his consent.
Obviously a fine countess.
Dear brother... you are going up in the world.
Hand it over, you ignoramus.
As your secretary, it is my solemn duty to read this.
"Beloved Luigi, my father has recently taken delivery... of a new pianoforte from Broadwood in London.
It is of the latest design and is the first of its kind in Vienna.
Tomorrow morning I will send away the servants and we shall all be out.
I have done this so that you might try this new invention undisturbed".
What is the meaning of this? What kind of trick have you played on me?
Stop it, Luigi.
- Herr Beethoven, I beg you.
- Now I see.
- I see perfectly.
- We mean you no harm.
- A little test!
- Luigi, wait!
It is terrible to rob me in this way... of my most treasured feelings!
Father can go to hell!
I bid you wait!
It's no use. He can't hear you!
He's deaf!
A month later
I married Count Gallenberg.
And you never heard from him again?
He wrote to me.
It was...
After the war, there had been some... unpleasantness.
It was a bad time.
They who think me hostile... obstinate or misanthropic... how unjust they are to me... for they do not know the secret reason I appear that way.
It is not possible for me to say, "Speak louder.
Shout. I am deaf".
How can I live if my enemies, who are many... believe I no longer possess the one sense that should be perfect... to a higher degree in me than in others?
Not so fast.
So what will you do?
See every shallow countess
Ludwig gave a dedication to?
They are all liars who want a piece of him now he is gone.
I have the lady's signature.
I shall study his correspondence to find the hand that matches.
It is illegible.
You are wasting your time.
- No court will uphold this nonsense.
- Help me then.
Are you mad?
Help you to cheat me?
I will tell you this.
There is no lady at the end of your search.
Ludwig was a woman hater.
Look at how he behaved with Johanna.
He had every right. Your brother took a bride of low character.
You are too much under Ludwig's influence to see the truth.
He wanted Caspar under his thumb.
Running his errands.
He hated Johanna because she took him away.
There she is.
Oh, she's so beautiful.
- A marvelous creature.
- She will be mine.
So, you would betray me for that?
Where is your book? Here.
Willingly.
She can be bought.
- All women can be bought.
- You are insulting the woman I love.
At first, it will be all enticements.
Then, snap! The trap shuts.
There's always a price to pay.
I would never betray you for one of those creatures.
Brothers, I have wonderful news.
She has finally consented.
- You are to be wed?
- Yes!
You explain to him.
May I... present my bride?
Is this a joke?
You cannot be serious.
By all means, copulate with her.
But marriage? What for?
You will be a laughingstock.
Every farmhand in the region has enjoyed her for free.
Why should you pay more?
I know you cannot hear me, and I don't care.
What I have to say is for Caspar, not you.
I have had lovers... but that is not a crime.
I told you it was impossible.
I only want what is right.
He was jealous of his brother.
Why, she will destroy him.
Jealous of his happiness.
I'm Ludwig van Beethoven, and I need your help.
Break the door down.
What are you playing at?
Arrest that whore.
- Don't touch her!
- Arrest that whore.
That is slander.
We were married yesterday.
She is with child.
Now leave!
He behaved no better when I married Therese.
He wanted us both at his beck and call.
Give up the search.
I cannot.
I have my reasons.
I will find this lady.
And she will claim her legacy with the full force of the law.
"The journey was dreadful.
The coach had to go and break down on such a terrible road.
And for no reason, just a country road.
I have to see you.
However much you love me,
I love you more.
Never hide yourself from me".
Excuse me. I'm looking for the Countess Erdödy.
Erdödy?
I'm looking for the Countess Erdödy.
Zoltan!
Schindler.
You do not recognize me?
Oh.
Please, sit.
Join me for dinner.
- Countess.
- Anna Marie.
These are my people I'm home now.
I don't have to play the countess.
I'm free!
Poor Louis.
I miss him so much.
His death has left a void.
The way they treated him... disgusted me.
He was too good for them.
His fire... offended their small brains.
But not you.
I could match his temperament.
You gave him rooms at your palace?
I wanted him near me.
Was he your lover?
Horns!
Clarinets!
From the beginning.
From the beginning.
That was how I met Louis... and how the world learned of his deafness.
I was separated from my husband.
I lived an independent life in Vienna with my three children.
I will arrange a housekeeper.
Please.
Oh, I had one.
She cheated me.
We had thought of Napoleon as a liberator... a force for change.
Now we saw the truth.
Bonaparte had declared himself emperor... and set out to conquer the world.
He said he brought freedom from the tyranny of kings.
But he was Saturn, gobbling up his children.
His cannon fired night and day... on the city of Vienna.
Leave her alone!
Mimi!
Fire!
Madam.
There is a gentleman here to see you.
I cannot receive anybody.
I think he is deaf.
He will not go away.
The countess will see you now.
Your son...
We will speak in music.
Napoleon was victorious.
The whole of Europe was at his feet.
He took a Hapsburg princess as his bride... and set up court at Schoenbrun Palace.
He proved himself no different than any aristocrat.
Everybody was betrayed.
This was the way of the modern world.
The year Louis lived with us... was the happiest of my life.
And, I think, of his too.
He opened his heart to me.
He called me his father confessor.
He told me everything.
You must have loved him very, very much.
With all my heart.
And he you.
I don't think so. No.
Then he was a fool!
I like you better drunk.
- It's good to talk about him.
- Yeah.
But is this why you came all this way?
No, not only.
You said there was some unfinished business.
There is.
But how can I help you, Anton?
Perhaps it's nothing.
And perhaps it's the key to him.
Perhaps they're right and I should let it go, but I cannot.
- It's impossible for me.
- But why?
It was that damned sonata... the "Kreutzer".
At the time I entertained ambitions of a musical career.
I'd gone to Vienna to study and was fortunate enough... to be taken by Schuppanzigh as a pupil.
He and George Bridgetower, the famous virtuoso from Africa... were about to premiere this new Beethoven sonata... at Count Razumovsky's that evening... and I was allowed to attend the rehearsal.
It was there that the seed of a mystery was planted... that haunts me to this day.
Do you like it?
I cannot hear them.
But I know they are making a hash of it.
What do you think?
Music is a dreadful thing.
What is it?
I don't understand it.
What does it do?
It exalts the soul.
Utter nonsense If you hear a marching band, is your soul exalted?
No, you march.
If you hear a waltz, you dance.
If you hear a mass, you take communion.
It is the power of music... to carry one directly into the mental state... of the composer.
The listener has no choice.
It is like hypnotism.
So, now... what was in my mind when I wrote this?
A man is trying to reach his lover.
His carriage has broken down in the rain.
The wheels stuck in the mud.
She will only wait so long.
This... is the sound of his agitation.
"This is how it is..." the music is saying.
"Not how you are used to being.
Not how you are used to thinking.
But like this".
Who was the woman?
He never told me.
I knew better than to ask.
He made me see the world in an entirely new light.
I abandoned my petty ambitions.
I fetched and carried for him.
I wrote his letters and smoothed over his domestic disputes.
I became his secretary.
Oh, the hag has sold it in the market for a souvenir.
Oh, no.
It's lost.
Gone forever.
Here.
Maybe not.
Ludwig was convinced he had left the sketch for his new symphony... in the safekeeping of his brother Caspar.
- My God. Here.
- Uncle!
The brothers had barely spoken for eight years.
This is Herr Schindler.
This is my brother Caspar... and my nephew, young Karl.
Had I realized this,
I would have stopped him.
It is good to see you.
I need the papers
I entrusted to you.
They were all returned to you.
I said, your papers are not here.
You.
Where are my notes?
I would rather he not cause a scene in front of the boy.
- What did the whore say?
- Get out of my house!
You've thrown away my music.
You and this foul slut you call a wife.
- You have betrayed me!
- Maestro!
Maestro, please!
Stop it!
He's sick!
Leave!
Never return to this house!
He has consumption.
Caspar died before the year was out... but there was no relief in his death.
Rather, it sent Ludwig on a path of action... that would lead to his destruction.
That man.
He rooms with her.
My brother's bed is not yet cold... and he is climbing in.
If he says nasty things about me, don't listen. None of it is true.
- Promise?
- I promise.
I will come and see you every day.
Come in.
Is this the lad?
Yes.
"By order of the Landrechte...
Ludwig van Beethoven has been appointed the legal guardian of his nephew Karl... owing to the low moral character of his mother, Johanna van Beethoven.
Rights of visitation for the mother will be at the discretion and convenience... of the legal guardian".
Too watery.
Write.
Then we shall have to find someone who can cook.
She has a swinish face anyway.
- Were you taught music?
- Yes.
I have a gift for you.
Come.
- Can you read?
- Yes.
Here.
Let me show you.
You shall be a musician.
I want to be a soldier.
A composer?
No. A soldier.
Oh.
I gave my first concert when I was your age.
I was terrible.
Your grandfather thought that he was going to make a fortune out of me... as a child prodigy.
Like Mozart's old man.
But I was pigheaded.
I wouldn't play that tinkly, pretty stuff that was in vogue then.
But the keyboards of the day were not up to it.
The first time I played at court,
I broke four strings.
Herr Beethoven!
The boy is hardly a Mozart, is he?
I was 12... but Father told them I was nine.
Mother died of consumption... and I became the head of the family.
Your papa...
I loved most of all.
As I love you... my dear Karl.
His eyes shone with joy... when he looked at the boy.
All the love in his rich and deep nature seemed to concentrate... on this boy.
There was no more tender father.
You should hear him play.
He is going to be a great virtuoso.
You spoil him.
Schindler tells me you've written nothing.
Well, I have no time.
And besides... all the servants that Schindler sends me are scoundrels.
You are impossible.
Perhaps.
You and I...
Could Karl... not replace the son that you lost?
I know what it is to lose a son.
I know the sorrow Johanna feels.
- She has no right to him!
- She's his mother!
She's his mother!
What new insanity is this?
It has come to our attention that you have been bribing servants... in order to have access to the boy in secret... while you well know that Herr Beethoven would not allow...
You are talking about my son.
My son, who I have not seen for a year, who is being taught to hate me.
The decree of the court states...
I know what it says.
Can you look me in the eye and tell me a mother has no right to see her son?
I will fight this.
You will lose.
He has many enemies.
The filth was bad enough.
That man is mad.
He cannot hear a thing.
He's always shouting and yelling.
The landlord would chuck him out from his carrying on.
The boy is just as bad.
His uncle encouraged him.
I overheard them discussing how they was going to beat me, so I left.
Was the boy kept clean?
He'd go a month without fresh underwear.
That man cannot look after himself, let alone a child.
I would now like to call
Karl van Beethoven.
Good afternoon, Karl.
Good afternoon.
How does your uncle treat you?
Well.
He has a hot temper?
Yes.
- Do you fear his temper?
- No.
- Did he ever punish you?
- Only when I deserved it.
Who would you prefer to live with?
Your uncle or your mother?
Do you want to stay with your uncle?
Yes.
Speak up.
- Yes.
- You don't sound certain.
It would be better if Uncle had someone to be with him... because he is hard of hearing and can't talk to me.
In fact, he is stone deaf.
Do you love your mother?
Yes.
Do you miss her?
Yes.
Then would you not prefer to live with her?
Uncle needs me.
What I would prefer... is that we might all live together.
This way, gentlemen, please.
Herr Beethoven, our most accomplished composer.
It is an honor.
Chancellor Metternich... due to his infirmity, Herr Beethoven has requested that I speak for him.
As you wish.
His case in the magistracies is not going well.
That is, Frau Beethoven has bribed witnesses...
Sir, I need your help.
My young nephew, Karl... he is being corrupted by this woman's poisonous carryings on.
- What Herr Beethoven means...
- Why should I help you, Beethoven?
"Metternich is a worse tyrant than Napoleon".
That was recorded last Tuesday at the Swan Tavern.
"Metternich should be forced to eat my shit".
And so on, and so forth.
Herr Beethoven, there are many forces in Austria... that foment revolt.
I like a lively discussion as much as the next man... but I fear that these days we cannot allow quite so much...
How can I put it?
Enthusiasm.
Perhaps it would be better if our great artists... were a little more circumspect.
Herr Beethoven proposes that he write a grand oratorio... praising Austria and your magnificent diplomacy... at the Congress of Vienna... that has secured the peace for all of Europe.
This court... has seen fit to ordain... that Johanna van Beethoven... shall be excluded from...
This court is corrupt!
Now that the boy was delivered to Ludwig, body and soul... the deaf genius began in earnest what was to be his most tragic endeavor... to make his ward a great virtuoso.
For five long years this was his goal... and in those five years
Ludwig wrote nothing.
Not the oratorio he promised Metternich.
Not the mass he promised the London Philharmonic Society.
Not the great symphony he spoke of endlessly.
Nothing.
In Vienna they thought he was finished... deaf, written-out.
Rossini had performed
The Thieving Magpie.. and Italian opera was all the rage.
Beethoven was no longer performed.
Karl!
It's late.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's disgusting.
Why does she disobey me? She knows my bowel is in a terrible state.
You're trying to poison me!
Well, she might appear plump and pretty to you... but she's a vulgar bitch.
Gossips about me all over town.
Fräulein!
Yes, sir?
Your food is poison.
You're fired.
You foul old bastard.
Write.
Where are you going?
Away from you.
Well, leave me, then.
You're evil.
Like your mother.
Leave me alone with no food.
Have you seen Karl?
You're worthless!
Worthless!
I'm sending for the doctor now.
Tomorrow.
Play for me.
Not now.
It will calm me.
Play.
I found this the other day.
"The Maestro,
Ludwig van Beethoven... has the pleasure to announce a concert... which will be the debut of his nephew and ward, Karl van Beethoven... a prodigy instructed by the Maestro himself".
Why, this is wonderful. The very thing that will raise his spirits.
You must be very excited.
Anton, have you ever heard me play?
- No, but...
- You have to help me.
I'm at the end of my tether.
Endless hours at the keyboard.
For what?
He cannot hear my ham-fisted playing.
He does no work.
All he does is scribble incomprehensible phrases.
Then he bellows this stupid, childish tune at the top of his lungs.
He says this is the motif of a grand symphony.
I think it's ridiculous.
- That cannot be.
- But it is.
I think he's going mad.
So...
I am to abandon my plans, eh?
I am placing... intolerable pressure.. on Karl, eh?
He is a... a mediocre talent.
There are always these... asinine fellows like Schindler... with their... commonplace opinions... from their commonplace minds.
Schindler is right.
Oh.
Anton Schindler... bad violinist... knows more about music than Ludwig van Beethoven.
This is too much.
You're torturing the boy.
I always thought that you were a bore... and an ass... but you've had your uses, and now you have none.
Get out.
Get out.
Wake up, bastard!
Schindler!
Wake up!
Karl.
He's gone... on your account.
My Karl has shot himself.
A farmer found him in the ruins.
He carried him here on his cart.
I fear the worst.
Uncle.
I was expecting you.
Karl was a bungler with firearms.
The bullet did not penetrate his skull.
He did not die.
But the legend grew in Vienna of Ludwig's cruelty to the boy... of how he drove him to a desperate act.
Those who had silently disliked him... now shouted their derision... from the rooftops.
There is a letter.
I must find this lady.
He bequeathed his entire estate to her.
It was not written to me.
Then who?
It was she who came between us.
I loved him completely... but he could never return that sentiment.
He could not forget her.
Who is she?
I failed him.
We all failed him.
He gave us so much.
We couldn't even make his life tolerable.
This last wish must be as he wanted.
Tell me.
Tell me her name.
The answer was always in front of you.
"While still in my bed... my thoughts turn to you... my immortal beloved.
What will you do?
Some happy, some sad...
I don't know. waiting to see whether fate will hear us.
I don't know.
I can live only completely with you or not at all.
Yes. It must be".
Go to her.
It must be.
May we speak in private?
I have nothing to hide from my workers.
I implore you.
As you can see,
I am very busy.
Frau Beethoven... may I see a sample of your handwriting?
- Why?
- Please.
Indulge me.
Here.
Is this your handwriting?
What is this?
A page from the registry of a hotel in Karlsbad.
I would like you to go.
Signed... by you.
Did you ever meet Ludwig in Karlsbad?
You can hardly be unaware of the manner in which I suffered at his hands.
I find the question as insulting as it is impudent.
What are you implying?
There can be no peace without the truth.
For you, maybe.
But I have made my peace with Ludwig.
I forgave him because of the "Ode to Joy".
When they announced the premiere of the Ninth Symphony... the gossip was everywhere.
Ludwig had fought with the singers.
He had fought the theater.
Even though
I had hated him for so long... even though he had tried to destroy me...
I went.
I had to go.
I knew it would be the last time.
I could not see him... and I imagined some last-minute insult... had sent him running home.
Then I saw him.
Everybody saw him.
Bravo!
He had revealed his most hidden secrets to us.
The circle was broken.
I could not hate the man who could write such music.
I saw him one more time... at his rooms on Schwarzspanier Strasse.
That was where he died.
His belly swelled so much... that the surgeon had to make a puncture to drain off the fluid.
The incision became inflamed.
His strength has gone, and I fear the death struggle has begun.
I want him to receive the last rites while he is still conscious.
But when I suggested
I send for a priest... he turned his face to the wall and called me an ass.
Then he asked for you.
I don't know why.
Is he sleeping?
I don't think so.
He is composing.
The comedy is over.
Yes.
I once loved him.
But he turned his back on me.
He abandoned me.
I never heard a word from him.
I was a fool.
I never meant anything to him.
But the letter...
What letter?
Frau Beethoven, I believe... this is addressed to you.
"My angel... my all... my other self.
Just a few words today, and that in pencil... yours.
Only tomorrow will I know for certain where I am to stay.
A worthless waste of time and such.
Why this deep sorrow?
If we could be united, we would feel this pain no longer.
Where I am... you are with me too.
Soon we shall live together, and what a life it will be".
- We must talk.
- Not here.
Caspar will come.
We must speak.
I'm talking too loudly.
Meet me in Karlsbad.
This is the address.
I can no longer skulk around like a guilty schoolboy.
I have your child in me.
Go.
"The journey was dreadful.
I did not arrive here until 4:00 in the morning.
At the last stop they warned me against traveling at night... and tried to frighten me about a forest... but that only tempted me.
The coach had to go and break down on such a terrible road for no reason.
Just a country road... and now I am held up completely.
But I have found another... and we will surely see one another soon.
Today, I hope.
I have to see you.
However much you love me...
I love you more.
Never hide yourself from me".
Herr van Beethoven!
Wait!
"While still in my bed... my thoughts turn to you... my immortal beloved.
Some of them happy, some sad... waiting to see whether fate will hear us.
I can live only completely with you or not at all.
Yes. It must be.
I must go to sleep now.
Be calm, love.
Today, yesterday... what longing with tears for you.
You.
You're my life.
My everything.
Farewell, then.
Go on loving me.
Ever yours, ever mine... forever".
My daughter is singing in the competition tomorrow evening.
June Allyson.
Loretta Young.
Her late father and l had such high hopes for her.
But she's determined to try to be a singer. l suppose she has some talent in that area. lt's such a relief you were able to accommodate us by bringing theSdresses.
Thank you.
Mother, this is it.
The perfect dress.
That's a beautiful dress, but it's not for my figure.
A well made dress works on any figure.
Certainly, mother.
You're so wilful, Edna.
Just like my sister, your namesake.
When, in her wild youth, she found herself 'in the family way', your father got her adopted and took care of her problem.
She haemorrhaged, and was scarred inside forever.
My mother made me swear l'd name my first daughter after Edna, who could never bear children of her own.
Turn around, Edna.
We'll take the dress she has on.
Mother, l can't sing in a dress that doesn't fit. Look at it.
The dress fits the occasion. lt's you who doesn't fit.
All right.
The blues ain't nothing but a woman crying for a man. l said the blues ain't nothing...
That is such a beautiful song. lt... Sorry.
Thank you.
-What is it?
-Something l've sung all my life.
Spiced up a little.
You sing it like you really mean it.
-What are you going to sing?
-l signed up to sing
'You'll Never Walk Alone'.
My mother says it's universal.
She says that personal songs never win, that they make people dwell on themselves. l don't know about that, but l know it's more fun to sing a song you like than to try to please everybody.
Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes...
-You know Rosemary Clooney?
-Yeah.
Love never made a fool ofyou.
You used to be too wise...
Sing a song that you like.
You got a stage and an audience and a real pretty dress.
Dress fits the occasion. lt's a real pretty dress.
When she wants some loving, l'm sure you women will understand.
She'll win.
She deserves it.
...although you find him real hard to please.
Thank you, Miss Shelley.
And coming to the end of the competing vocalists, number 9,
Edna Buxton, from Chestnut Hill, shall be singing
''You'll Never Walk Alone.''
Miss Buxton will be singing...
-''Hey There.''
-''Hey There.''
Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes, love never made a fool ofyou, you used to be too wise.
Hey there, you on that high flying cloud, though he won't throw a crumb to you, you think some day he'll come to you, better forget him, him with his nose in the air, he has you dancing on a string, break it and he won't care.
Won't you take this advice l offer, like a mother, or are you not seeing things too clear?.
Are you too much in love to hear?. ls it all going in one ear and out the other?.
And finally, first prize, a recording contract with McMartin Records, goes to Miss Edna Buxton.
Let's give her a big hand, ladies and gentlemen.
Congratulations.
-What are you going to be singing?
-''ln Another World.''
-And who wrote it?
-l did.
Okay, go ahead, anytime. lfl couldjust tell you how my poor heart is breaking,
Maybe you'd think twice about the road that you're taking.
Maybe you would look back and change your mind, maybe you would remember the love you left behind.
All l have is the memory of when l was your girl.
How can l reach you when you're living in another world?
When you're living in another world.
Living in another world.
Yeah...
Thank you.
Come on in.
Nice, nice, voice.
Thank you.
But the thing is, we already have someone...
-Just like me
-...just like you.
Excuse me.
-Sit down.
-l'm sorry.
-Do you want...
-lt's my only copy. lt's ruining my song.
Sit, sit.
Boy, you've been at this a while, huh? l'm sorry. lt's just that... l came here eleven months ago, supposed to be this big contract when l won this prize and it's just all a big publicity stunt.
Bunch of rats. Who was it?
McMartin, right?
Yeah, it was. lt was McMartin. l've been pounding the pavement ever since only to be told that you already have someone like me.
Do you want me to really burst your bubble?
Sure, go ahead, start bursting.
Not only do we all already have somebody like you, but we all are trying to get rid of the someone like you we already have.
Yeah, well.
The thing is, toots.
The Patty Page and Peggy Lee days are over.
Lady singers don't sell.
Male vocal groups, that's the ticket these days.
-You know l wrote it?
-lt's very nice.
-Thank you.
-lt really is.
Okay, l guess l'll just take my burst bubble and just...
-l'm sorry about that.
-No, that's okay.
Wait a second, let me hold on to this.
-l have a stupid idea.
-Really?
Don't hold your breath or anything,
-l'll just see what l can do.
-Really? Thank you.
-Thank you.
-You're very nice.
-There's really no need to cry now.
-Okay, l'm sorry.
Oh, the blues ain't nothing but a woman crying for a man. l said the blues ain't nothing but a woman loving a married man.
The blues ain't nothing but a common low down heart disease.
Try to keep your man happy although you find him real hard to please.
-Oh, my God, it's...
-Yeah.
Hi. Hi. Look, l tried to return the dress.
No, it looks good.
How's that big recording career going? lt's really... Well, it's not too swinging actually. l'm Doris Shelley and this is Betty and this is Sha sha. l'm Edna. You guys are swell too, you were really swell.
Stop it.
Well, l just better go.
Edna, come back.
We play Tuesday through Friday. weekends are reserved for him.
Gotcha.
MlSS EDNA BUXTON.
PLEASE CONTACT JOEL MlLLNER.
CHARNY MUSlC.
PHONE KLONDlKE 5-7329.
Edna?
Joel Millner? l've been looking for you all week.
You don't have a phone?
-No.
-Why not? You need a phone.
You can't make it without one.
What are you drinking?
-Vanilla Coke.
-Disgusting.
Are you eating? l'm buying.
Can we get some service?
We've waited 20 minutes.
Hold on a sec, l'm busy.
She'll have a grilled cheese, tomato and onion rings and l'll have cheeseburger and malted milk.
-Anyway, so your demo...
-Yes, ''ln Another World''.
That's it. Nice voice, great song.
-Thank you. l wrote it.
-l know you did. lt's funny, when l listened to it l thought how nuts it was for a gal to be singing such strong material.
-So l'm unfeminine now too?
-That's what l like. Only...
-You have someone just like me.
-There's no one else like you. l manage a male vocal group,
The Stylettes, you heard of them?
-Sure. Yes.
-Yes?
This song is perfect for them.
We could all make some money.
-l bet you have other songs.
-No.
-l'm planning to record my own songs.
-What?
You're either a singer or a songwriter.
-l'm both.
-Nobody's both.
-You're one or the other.
-Well, l'm both.
The day will come again when girl singers are top of the heap, until then, why not make money writing for other people?
-So you want me to sell my songs?
-Let me prove it to you. l'll book a studio, you can meet the fellas, listen to them sing it, if you don't like it, l won't bug you again.
Trust me, l'm Joe Millner, l'm a nice Hebrew boy.
Actually my mother's ltalian, l'm from New Jersey.
Can l be perfectly honest?
You got to change your name.
Edna Buxton is the worst name l ever heard in my life.
Where you from to get a name like that?
-Philadelphia.
-Ouch, it keeps getting worse.
Wait a minute.
The Buxtons of Philadelphia?
Not Buxton Steel?
We got to do a little reinvention.
Hey, kiddo. Come on in.
-Sure.
-Good to see you.
Fellas, this is the young lady who wrote your next hit. l want to introduce you all to
Denise Waverly.
From South Philly.
You ever been there?
Well, she's an original to rise up out of those slums.
-Hi, Rick.
-Walter. Nice to meet you.
-Full service. l'll take your coat.
-Denise Waverly? What is this, Joel?
All l have is a memory of when you were my girl.
-Come on, man.
-Get him a lyrics sheet. l know the lyrics. l know the lyrics! That's just it. l don't hear you know them.
What you wrote here, being in love with someone you can't have, and you let them go and have their own life. Beautiful. lt's something that happened to me. l know how personal it must be. l don't want to invade your privacy, l just want to do the song righteous.
Jeez, l don't need to hear any more.
The song is yours, guys. lt never happened to me anyway. l just made it up to pass the night away. lf that's the case, we need a B side.
What else have you got?
Well, l sort of write for girls like myself.
-Something upbeat, up tempo.
-Up tempo, okay.
Something new for me, but okay, let's see what l can do.
You'll get the same percentage as me.
Okay, but only until l can record my own stuff.
-When l make my own...
-Absolutely.
Read it before you sign it.
This is my new receptionist, Judy.
Hi.
Now l want you to worry about writing personal songs
-like ''ln Another World''.
-Then l am worried.
What if l can't think up another one?
Look around you, everyone is in pain.
Come, l want to show you your office.
You got a piano, nice window with a view.
You got a roof. You put a plant here, it's like you're in the country.
You can pace back and forth, if you're a pacer.
Hey, Money! How you doing?
You hear the sound?
Airplanes, everything.
Good vocals, if you're frustrated.
You schmuck!
-You don't like it?
-No, l do.
-You don't like it.
-l like it, it's just... l write songs in my bedroom or the bathtub or fire escape.
You're a professional now. l'll tell you a little secret.
This is where all the hits are going to be made from now on.
Right here. One scene, all happening under one roof.
You have your artists and songwriters recording studio and musicians all in the same building, you could have a new hit every week.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.
Hey, could l listen to that a sec?
Come on, just for a sec.
-lt's ''ln Another World''!
-Can l listen to the song now?
-Why don't you buy the record?
-You go buy it, if you can find it.
-l bought the last copy at the store.
-You're kidding?
She bought the last copy.
Oh, my God!
Taxi!
-l didn't do it.
-l don't want to hear it.
Hey, Sha sha, hey, Betty.
Where's Doris?
Out back with him, or it, l should say.
-Problems with Eddy again?
-He's a dog, girl. l mean it. l mean it!
-Maybe l should go speak to her?
-Talk some sense into her. l'll do my best.
-Did l hear her call you Edna?
-What are you doing here?
Your name is Denise Waverly. l've got to protect your image. l'll introduce you to everybody here as Denise Waverly if l have to.
-Okay, Jeez, Denise Waverly...
-Oh, now l have to see this guy?
Joel Millner, what are you doing here?
What do you mean? l'm always here.
What about you? Never mind.
Let me introduce you to a real songwriter, Denise Waverly.
This is Howard Cazsatt,
The Village phoney.
-He learned from me too.
-Why introduce me to him? l'm introducing him to you.
A nobody to somebody.
Denise did something you'll never do.
-What?
-She wrote a number one hit.
-A number one?
-lt will be it's number 5 now. lt's number twelve, Joel.
-l'm cutting in.
-''ln Another World'' You heard it?
-You wrote that? That's cool.
-You like it?
-Yeah.
-l gotta go see a girl.
-Nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you, buddy.
That is one hard looking woman.
Don't get any ideas.
My girl has too much class for you.
Sweetie.
Look, my manager's out there tonight.
Joel. l told you about him.
Just forget about Eddy for a while.
Go out there and sing your song.
Okay? l'm okay. l'm okay.
Nobody knows the way l feel this morning.
Wow, Joel, ain't they just the most?
-They'd make terrific backup singers.
-Backup singers!
Thanks, Cazsatt.
You're a doll. l really like that song you did for The Stylettes.
You really liked it? lt was very commercial and even with Negroes singing, it's very white.
What? lt didn't deal with real nightmares like unemployment and crippled male egos which l suspect is the true reason why romance is so tortured for these people.
You were going for a mass audience.
And the lyrics, while a little sentimental, they really do work.
They do. lf anything, it suffers from shoddy arrangement.
So what exactly did you like about it, the thickness of the vinyl?
By the way, l did that shoddy arrangement that you're describing.
You're a horse's ass!
-What did you do to her?
-Nothing. She went nuts on me. l think she wants me.
He's a playboy but l know one day across the threshold he'll carry me.
You're dreaming. l don't care what the other girls say,
One fine day he'll marry me.
-l'm dreaming, l'm dreaming.
-l didn't know there was a solo.
-She's dreaming.
-l like it. Let's do it.
Me too.
Across the threshold he'll carry me.
You're dreaming. l don't care what the other girls say, one fine day he'll marry me.
-That was nice.
-That was good.
Oh, Jesus. When he comes in...
He wears a wig so...
-Naturally.
-Don't mention it. l'm not in the mood to meet anyone until my fourth cup of coffee.
-Try and keep an open mind.
-Coffee, coffee.
Coffee, l need coffee.
All right, Joel, sit there and listen.
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hi.
He doesn't love me but l love him so, always thinking of that boy, but he never thinks ofme.
My heart's a toy and like a little child, he breaks it when he's through.
He fools around and he puts me down but there 's nothing l can do. ljust live for the moments with him.
-Be careful!
-His touch is soft
-and the lights are dim.
-Watch out!
Oh, what a trance he puts me in. l guess that l was born to love that boy.
She was born to love that boy. l guess that she was born to love that boy.
He's a playboy but l know one day across the threshold he'll carry me.
You're dreaming. l don't care what the other girls say, one fine day he'll marry me. l guess that l was born
-to love that boy.
-She was born to love that boy. l guess that she was born to love that boy.
She was born to love that boy. l guess that l was born to love that boy.
That was great, really great.
Right, Joel?
Yes, yes, it was nice.
-Real nice. Thank you.
-That was great.
-You guys were great.
-Thank you.
You can be so rude.
Rude? You dragged me in here before l could have my caffeine.
They were great, you know it.
Great song.
You were holding out on me.
Why did you save your best song for girls? l can't sell girl singers, not at this time. l didn't save it for them.
The song came from the girls.
-You didn't write it?
-Yeah, but it's their story.
''Look around, there's pain everywhere.'' l took your advice.
-But l still can't sell girl singers
-Okay, all right. Swell.
Could you leave then so l can work.
They're a mess.
They're cute. But those hairdos...
-Their hairdos.
-Those trashy high heels.
Couldn't they get matching dresses like the one the lead singer stole?
-What's the name of that song?
-''Born To Love That Boy'' l was born to love that boy. l was born to love that boy...
Great fucking song! Excuse me. lt's a great song.
-All right, l'll think about it.
-You will? lt's in my system. l can't get it out.
Congratulations. lt's a wonderful song.
Thanks, Joel.
Girls tell me he's a renegade and l know about the games he's played, but his sweet kisses, l wouldn't trade. l guess that l was born to love that boy.
You'll love that.
Get in there.
You hear this song?
You should go in.
''The success of the Luminaries can only be attributed to Joel Millner, securing a deal for unknowns when female voices are absent from the airwaves. The heart and vision of this phenomenon is songwriter Denise Waverly.
Her courage to admit the failure, pain and the flaws in the people for whom she writes and her contradictory optimism is bittersweet and affirming.
The Luminaries are the great vocal discovery of the year but the voice behind their power is Denise Waverly.''
You just made that up.
You think l could dream up a review like that?
-''Mystical opticism...''
-''Optimism'' l will take some credit though.
The reviewer, J. Murray, is a friend.
-l told him about you.
-What did you say?
How l'm just exploiting the pain of the working class negro? l told him the truth. That you're the best songwriter in this business.
-Thank you, Cazsatt.
-You're welcome, Miss Waverly.
What are you doing here? Spying on us evil imperialist pop song writers?
-l have an office down the hall.
-Are you the janitor?
Oh, that's funny.
Listen, l wanted to propose something.
Would you consider writing a song with me?
Hear me out.
We set a love song in the underclass ghetto.
Two machinists fall in love on the graveyard shift
-at a plumbing parts factory.
-Boy, you are some romantic.
-l think we'd make a good team.
-ls that so?
Yeah. l appreciate what you're saying, but... l wouldn't know how to save myself with a song, much less the world.
Besides, l don't intend to write songs much longer because l'm a singer and l'm going to record my own stuff.
But l appreciate the offer.
Well, please keep me in mind,
Miss Waverly. l will, Mr Cazsatt. l'll keep you in mind.
Know-it-all.
''Optimism.''
Well, don't you look nice.
Oh, this old thing...
Okay, that's enough of that.
All right, the real test is when you're making out. Let's practise.
Oh, Howard. Oh, Howard.
Howard, stop that.
Howard, no, please.
Jesus! Okay.
You're playing my melody.
-Okay, what have we got?
-This is the melody.
-Let's do the lyric.
-A negro couple under a streetlamp.
Streetlamp, my ass!
They were on the fire escape.
A streetlamp signifies the urban condition better.
-Were you there?
-No, l wasn't. l was there, and they were on the fire escape.
How about a fire escape under a streetlamp?
-That way you get your realism.
-And your urban existential...
Hey, Betty.
Here are the new lead sheets.
-Who's that?
-That's Annie, my niece.
She got herself in some trouble.
You dig?
-''For love.''
-She's so young. l know. She's twelve!
-Does she have any family?
-l'm her family.
What's gonna happen to her? l don't know, but l tell you, l can't help this time.
Don't you have anything to say?
You're just standing there.
The trouble with these little girls is that they all think they're grown.
So the boy is depressed.
Why is he depressed? Because...
He's 16, he's a negro and no one's going to hire him.
No, because he knocked up his 12 year old girlfriend.
Anyway it's her story, not his.
That'll work. Yeah, all right.
She's knocked up and he's a wreck because he doesn't want the kid.
-He doesn't know how to support it.
-And she was unwanted.
-But she wants to keep the kid.
-Yes, she wants a family. Right.
How can l tell them?
How can l explain?
All the love that l never had l found in him.
Wait l got this one.
He gave her his child but wouldn't give her his name.
Come on, that was good.
Admit it.
There 's a local game where they whisper my shame.
They say he gave her his child he wouldn't give her his name.
How can l tell her?.
How can l express how it felt when he came to my room and helped me to undress.
What can she tell me?
How can l believe that she really didn't hear me cry when he wouldn't leave?
The company's under pressure from the churches.
That's great.
Controversy is good for business.
Controversy is good?
You're out of your mind.
These Bible thumpers are putting pressure on the radio station. lf the record company pulls it, that's it, no business. Get it?
You write a sympathetic song about two kids who aren't married and about to have a baby?
You kids have no idea how the world works.
Maybe your friend,
John Murray, could help.
Howard, you're no stranger to controversy. l've been writing controversial songs for five years.
Record companies wouldn't take a risk on me, but that's me.
You know, risk and controversy.
Denise, are you also an advocate?
Yeah, we're both advocates.
Denise?
Hell, l just write pop songs.
But you realise of course that no one else is writing songs about unwed pregnancy.
Just you. ls it because of your working class background that you feel free to examine these very real, honest themes in your music? l can assure you my background doesn't have anything to do with it. l'm curious. You had a big hit last year with ''ln Another World'' that you wrote by yourself.
Why did you choose to collaborate this time?
We met and hit it off and decided to work together.
Denise? l guess what he's saying is basically true.
Joel Millner introduced us at Fernando's Blue Room in Harlem.
He's the man that we blame.
-ls the marriage made in heaven?
-No, no.
We're not married.
We're just partners. l'm here with Denise Waverly and Howard Cazsatt who have written the controversial new song by The Luminaries.
''Unwanted number''.
-Available now.
-Thank you. Lost Beat Records.
We certainly are going to keep playing it here.
Thank you, John.
-You were great, honey. Terrific.
-Was l? l thought you were very honest and straightforward in what you said.
Thank you.
-Can we take these off?
-No, take them with you!
-Hi.
-Hi.
Could l just give this to...
-John?
-Yeah.
-What?
-Miss Waverly just dropped this by. l'll call you back.
Denise! l'm so glad l caught you. l didn't mean to drag you from your work. l can't think of a more delightful way to avoid a confrontation with one of my writers.
So what is this?
Well, it's a toaster, what do you think? lt's pretty obvious. l just wanted to thank you for having us on the show.
This is amazing. l've been looking for these for years. l heard you say it on your show and l was down in the Village in an old thrift shop and l saw them, so l got them for you.
-You like them?
-Thank you so much.
Well, l should get back. l can't avoid this forever.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
Howard, we should write a wedding song.
What's the social angle? l wasn't thinking about that.
That's your department. l don't believe in marriage.
What do you mean?
You're joking, right?
No. What?
Oh, God, come on.
You believe in it?
Marriage is a bourgeois convention.
Do you honestly think a contract can or should bind people to each other?
Why should modern affairs be modelled on an arrangement forced on people by the church and state during feudal times?
Even then it didn't work. Men brought home syphilis to their wives.
Well, l just think that people taking vows in front of other people...
-What?
-lt's kind of beautiful. l think that romanticism bullshit keeps people in bondage.
Your friend John Murray is married, he's not conservative.
Babe, John Murray?
-Do you have a crush on this guy?
-No.
-You do, look at you.
-l do not.
-Forget about him. You're mine.
-Am l?
-You want me to sign here?
-Right here.
-Joel...
-l'd like you to meet...
-The new receptionist.
-No, this lady here is a new member of the Charney Music family. l just signed Cheryl and her partner.
The song they've written is going to be
The Luminaries next hit.
That's great. That's great.
-Thanks.
-They could use a hit.
The last three songs we wrote were banned from the radios. lt's funny, because in Europe, such bannings are never heard of.
-Really?
-l guess we're far more free thinking.
-Denise Waverly.
-Cheryl Steed.
Hi. lf you need anything, my office is just down the hall.
Thank you. Mine is just next door, if you need me for anything.
-What?
-Next door.
The front of the building.
You have windows, that's nice. l insisted.
This place is so dreary.
Hello.
Hi.
Howard, honey, this is Cheryl.
-She's part of the family now,
-Welcome. so just think of her like a sister.
Howard is my writing partner and he's also my boyfriend.
-Who's your partner?
-Matthew.
He's my husband.
That's great, isn't it?
-l'll be next door.
-l'm just looking.
-Miss... Waverly.
-Yeah, welcome aboard.
-Howard.
-Adieu.
Adieu.
-She's got the cutest little accent.
-l'll ''adieu'' you!
She's from Europe. l'm getting hot.
-Your husband is 20 minutes late.
-l know, but l called
-and he's on his way.
-Where is he?
We have to wait for Matthew. l can't start without him.
Time is money. Let's go.
-Come on, Joel.
-l'm not waiting longer. Sorry.
Let's put one down.
-l can't afford this.
-Fine, but you're laying it on thick.
Make the vocals high so we can really hear the lyric.
-l understand.
-lt's important. l met you in December, underneath the wintersky, l could tell by the kissing on New Year's you were going to be my guy.
February tapped me on the shoulder, turned around and whispered in my ear...
You decided to come?
We've been waiting two hours,
Joel's been looking at his watch, the girls have been hanging around.
All this studio time costs a fortune.
Get of my back.
Where were you? l'm here now, okay?
Let's go to work.
We are working.
Now it's June and we're going to get married the day you say that l'm the one.
Do you make a promise that we'll always be together?.
-l do.
-l do.
Denise, what do you think? l think it's a sure hit, Joel.
Congratulations.
Excuse me.
Cheryl.
Do you make a promise that our love will last forever?.
-l do.
-l do.
Do you?
Okay, l'm a boop. We should've written that wedding song.
''l do'' is number four.
Howard, you're not going to believe this, but l think l'm pregnant.
No, l pulled out.
You see, l went to the doctor today and... he's pretty sure that l am, we just have to wait and see if the rabbit dies.
-How long does that take?
-About a week.
Oh, shit.
There's something else.
My name isn't really Denise. lt's Edna,
Edna Buxton. Buxton Steel, that's my family's business.
Joel invented the whole name and working class persona. l knew you'd be disappointed.
So you're telling me that you're an heiress?
-Yeah.
-You're an heiress?
-You're an heiress.
-Yeah.
You don't look like an heiress.
That's nice! What's an heiress supposed to look like?
Grace Kelly.
That's the sort of woman l thought l'd end up with.
Someone with that kind of grace.
When we hit it off, it surprised me. l always thought my dream girl would be blonde and coy.
Howard, that's a terrible thing to say.
Honey, l'm sorry. lt's just l'm scared, that's all.
We don't have any money right now. lf you have a baby you won't be able to work anymore. l can. l can take the baby to work.
The Brill Building?
Great place to bring up a kid. lt's not a bad place.
What the hell is your name again?
-Ethel? Effy? Alberta?
-lt's Edna.
-Buxom?
-Edna Buxton. lt's a fine name.
Thank God the kid's gonna have my name.
Yeah, Cazsatt.
Songwriters Denise Waverly and Howard Cazsatt were married in a 15 minute civil ceremony in New York this weekend.
The couple are expecting a child in October.
You're hanging on to dreams that will never come true.
Hey, guys, that was really terrific.
On the bridge, when you get to the kid, you're cutting it off a bit.
Stretch it.
Stretch the kid out, guys.
-Get her some water.
-Let it come to a natural end.
-Why don't you sit down?
-Okay.
Let's make hit records. Start.
Heartbreaking,
King ofsorrow,
Blue today, bluer tomorrow, lt's all up to you, what will you do?
Heartbreaking.
That's a damn good song, doll.
Keep her knocked up and she'll make you a millionaire.
-This is going to be a hit.
-What?
-Her first since...
-She started writing with me.
-l didn't say that.
-Could you guys...
-l'll see you at home.
-Howard! You can't just leave.
Denise, concentrate on your work, all right?
Joel, your tact isn't helping.
You're blaming me that your husband's jealous of your talent.
He's not jealous. l'm getting really fed up with the way...
-Joel, l need to talk to you.
-My water is breaking.
-What's happening?
-My waters broke. Get Howard.
-l can't, l'm going to be sick.
-Get Howard!
-What's happening?
-l'm having a baby. Just get Howard.
-Howard!
-Howard!
Everybody out! lt's not an epidemic! l'm having a baby. lt's a perfectly natural...
Guys, l'm really sorry. l'll get Howard.
-We got to get you to hospital.
-l know.
Cheryl.
Oh God, what did l do here?
What happened?
-l'm going to have a baby.
-Now?
-Yeah.
-Oh, God!
Come on, it's okay.
Here, l'll wheel you out. Okay.
Come on, honey.
She's asleep already.
-She's asleep.
-Oh, okay.
What a pretty face.
And this is where l work.
This is where l come every day and l write pretty songs with daddy.
Here's your Uncle Joel.
You got her?
Denise, now that your collaboration with Cazsatt has taken a different direction, l started looking around for...
Well, for an interesting...
Look, l thought maybe you two gals could try writing a song together.
She writes with her husband.
How would Matthew feel?
He would be devastated. l see no reason why Cheryl's talent should be exclusive to her husband. l'm sure she would agree with you.
Now that l'm back...
Take it easy. This is no
'Et tu, Brute' business.
There's no betrayal, it's an experiment.
You guys combine, if you combust, we ignite, we go.
-Joel, no...
-We could work together but...
Now the first assignment is to come up with something for Kelly Porter.
No, Joel. No.
-Kelly Porter, the ingenue? No.
-Kelly Porter, yes.
Not ''Dring Dring, Are You Home?''
Kelly Porter?
She ran out of hairspray.
-She's getting her hair done.
-l'm glad you're so enthusiastic. l'm going to split in ten minutes.
How long have we been here?
-Cheryl, patience, patience.
-Oh, look.
She seems upset.
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi.
Let me talk first.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Sorry we're late.
-l'm Marion, l'm Kelly's roommate.
-Marion.
-Denise, Cheryl.
-Cheryl Steed.
Hi, l'm Kelly Porter. lt's so nice to meet both of you.
Okay, so you have your meeting. l'll make a reservation.
-Chinese.
-Yeah, that'd be swell.
Bye.
So.
Gosh, l'm honoured that you'd consider writing for me.
People have certain ideas about me that are created by my publicist and this TV show l do.
They really have no idea who l am or what my life is like.
Or what l go through... for the person l love.
Kelly, you know boy problems are always hard. l wouldn't know.
Sorry, l'm fine. l read that Johnny Crawford gave you a puppy for your birthday.
That's fabulous because he's such a dreamboat.
-He is very good looking.
-Yes. He sweats a lot.
-Oh, hi.
-Hi, Marion.
-l'm here, are you ready?
-l think l am, aren't l?
Yeah. We've got a sense of who you are and what you're about.
-Some ideas to throw around.
-And write you terrific songs.
Wonderful.
Call me if you any questions.
Bye, Kelly.
Marion, it was nice to....
-l don't believe it.
-Oh my God.
-What.
-My breast milk is leaking. lt's Luma's feeding time. l'll see you back at the office in half an hour. Sorry. l gotta feed her before l burst, Cheryl.
Wait till l tell Howard.
He's gonna die.
Hey, Howard,
Kelly Porter is not the square we thought she was.
Oh, my...
Come here, Luma.
Oh, my God.
-Honey, let me explain.
-Explain?
Just stay. Both of you.
Just stay.
Where do you want to go, lady? l don't know.
-Can we just drive for a bit?
-Sure.
My secret love.
You and l, we're likes spies in the house ofholy love.
We 're actors in a heartless play. l smile my smile and play my part and forever hide my lonely heart, my secret love.
Kelly, it sounds really good, but the key to the song is the build and you can be dramatic as long as it's truthful, okay?
Guys, l know there's a lot of chefs in the kitchen here.
Let's just try to get a great take and groove.
Let's start.
Roll tape.
Oh, Larry, you're so manly.
Love has never been easy for me, can't you see... lt's better already.
-You did a good job.
-l think we did a good job.
-Joel was right.
-For God's sake, don't tell him that.
Girls like me have to hide our hearts away.
-Cheryl...
-What? l'm pregnant again.
-What?
-Yeah, l'm pregnant again. l thought you said you were using a diaphragm?
We never used it, it's on the ceiling.
They'll destroy us if they can.
Say we were struck down by the hand...
-What do you want to do?
-Howard's not around, l got to raise Luma... l feel like l don't have a choice.
And keep our disguise,
Stand by our lies...
Here's a name.
He's in Pennsylvania and he'll only charge you a hundred dollars.
He'll give you anaesthesia, penicillin and night's rest. lf you're going to do something, do this. Don't go to Spanish Harlem unless you want bleed to death in an elevator shaft. l refuse, l'd sooner die than tell. l'm under yoursweet spell, my secret love.
Thanks. l owe you one. l think we got a hit record here, girls.
What about going for a drink later, after the session?
-l know a really nice place.
-No, thank you.
No.
Like Romeo and Juliette they will chase us to our deaths then foist their false regret... l couldn't keep this one. l'm sorry. l can't believe it's over although l know it's true.
How could this happen to me and you? lt happens to otherpeople. somehow their lives go on.
What will l do now...
Come on Emily, let's go.
-Hi.
-Denise!
Oh my God, John!
-This little redhead yours?
-Yeah. ls this your little girl?
-Yeah.
-Hi.
-Come and have a seat.
-Hey, sweetie.
She's adorable.
We're just gonna meet her brother on the other side of the park, but she made me stop and wait. Like a woman.
How's your little girl getting along without her daddy?
You know.
She sees Howard every weekend, he and the new wife.
But he's crazy about her anyway.
She was never really the problem.
Still, divorce is tough on a kid.
That's kind of a conventional notion.
Well, l'm kind of a conventional person.
We can't predict the future.
We can't undo the past.
But it won't always hurt this bad.
Well, you know, l've got friends...
And just try and keep busy, you know.
-How's your wife?
-Oh, well, she's holding up.
She doesn't get out much.
She won't hire a baby-sitter...
She doesn't feel comfortable leaving them,
-so we don't have much social life.
-You're kidding.
Love doesn't ever fail us.
We 've got it turned around... l got to get Luma and get to work. l got a lot of stuff to do.
-lt was great to see you.
-lt was great seeing you too.
Maybe we should plan it next time.
Girl, it was us who...
You look great.
-Hi.
-Don't eat the burnt part.
Annie, Jesus, thank God you're here.
Here you go, butter 'em up.
Denise, it's only 8:00. l'm ten minutes early. l know, but...
There's a new invention: pantyhose that make your life a lot easier.
-Oh, keys, keys, keys!
-Keys, keys.
Okay, she's got a little cold.
Make sure she wears a sweater.
Bye, sweetie.
Eat your breakfast.
Be good.
Your coat!
Your coat!
Annie, l'm gonna be home a little late, about 6:30.
-Bye.
-Leaves early. Coming home late.
Smells like there's a man in your mama's life, Luma girl.
Oh, John. l don't... l don't need a friend.
-l mean, l have friends.
-Yeah.
You'd be a wonderful friend, really. lt's just that...
-Yeah. l know.
-You know.
Gosh. l'm sorry. Maybe we should go or something.
How do you look without those glasses on? l've seen it happen, Edna.
He gives you nothing. Didn't your mother ever teach you Rule Number 1 ?
Don't fall in love with married guys.
No, that wasn't part of the breeding.
Sex... never discussed.
You haven't written a song since this started.
He's made you forget about your work, your dreams, so you could plan your life around his timetable.
He hasn't made me do anything.
For the first time in my life, l love someone without conditions.
-He's costing me money!
-He's gonna inspire me so much, l'll write you a dozen hit songs.
Sure.
When he breaks your heart.
No, thank you.
New receptionist, Joel?
How are The Beatles gonna put us out of a job?
They write their own stuff and every group coming up from England now... is following that trend.
What are you gonna do when there's no need for Songwriter magazine?
Probably start a little fanzine for
Denise Waverly on the West Coast.
-Why? Are you moving?
-Moving? Not that l know of.
But you could, right?
You could move away.
With your family. Just move away, so l'd never see you again.
A safe could fall on my head.
Look, l'm not gonna disappear on you.
You said you'd stay here by my side...
The truth is you...
Let's wash the doll.
That was little Tammy Lee with ''Truth ls You Lied'', written by Denise Waverly.
You're listening to the RCA Songwriters' Hour on WKEE. l'm John Murray.
One more show and l'll be transplanted to Chicago ofall places.
But we hope you'll continue to stay tuned to WKEE to hear the very best songwriters showcased such as Denise Waverly whose life is every bit as inspiring as her work. Amazing stuff.
You wanna cut a record?
-Cut it out, Joel.
-l talked to Red Bird today.
They'll sign you for one single. l don't have a song to sing.
For five years you've been bugging me to record. l thought you'd been saving up material for this day.
No, contrary to what you suspected, l never held out on you.
That's my girl. So write something. lsn't that what l pay you for?
Yeah, write something. l don't... l don't know. l don't think l have anything left inside of me.
-lt's just gone.
-Let me tell you something.
Are you listening to me?
This bullshit you're wallowing in is happening outside yourself. lf you could pick yourself out of the crap, you'll realise that
Mr. Married Guy let you down, not your talent.
Don't let these other bastards get you down. Come on. l have the perfect producer lined up. Come on, sit up.
This guy, he's the new ''hit-maker'' genius, the next ''wunderkind.''
-Phil Spector?
-Phil Spector, history!
-Shadow Morton?
-Don't you hear me?
He's no Liberace, who l feel is valid in his own right.
He's an Einstein in the control booth. He's a wizard.
Direct your eyes right here.
Take a run at the sun...
While The Beatles and The Byrds are both at work on what are being termed ''concept albums'', teen favourites, The Riptides, are also changing directions.
Oh, Joel.
Jay Phillips, on guitar.
He's the brains behind the band, and the wizard behind your next hit.
Jay Phillips caught the critics' attention when he added orchestral instruments into theirsurfsound.
Surf and turf stuff.
That's not my thing.
This was only the beginning ofPhillips' imagination.
What we can expect from this new record? l really don't know what to expect myself. l'm kindajust gonna sort of let the album dictate itself to me.
But l can guarantee it'll be different from anything you've heard from The Riptides before.
Very, very talented.
Very sweet. A little out there.
He's from California. ls there any particular theme orsubject stringing it all together like some of the other concept albums being recorded now?
Childhood. lnnocence.
How a kid looks at things. How a kid'll make up a song so the lyrics don't always make sense to adults.
Kids are cool.
-Can you give us an example?
-He's not so bad. l heard Lennon wrote a song about a walrus and McGuinn wrote a song about a spaceman.
There 's a thing in music now where you can write a song about...
You can write about anything, notjust a protest or love songs.
On this new album, l'm into writing songs like kids do when they're singing to themselves orplaying in their yard.
Sounds pretty far out.
-Yeah, far out.
-The world's waiting, Jay.
Listen, l want you to seriously think about this.
Hear what l said?
Sorry. So, l'll just... lt's been a while.
Let's just go for it.
Now l have nothing so, God give me strength
'cause l'm weak in his wake.
But ifl'm strong l might still break and l don't have anything to share.
That l won't throw away into the air.
That song is sung out, this bell is rung out.
He was the light that l'd bless.
He took my last chance ofhappiness.
So, God give me strength
God, ifhe'd grant me
His indulgence and decline l might as well...
Wipe him from my memory fracture the spell as he becomes my enemy.
Maybe l was washed out like a lip print on his shirt.
See l'm only human l want him to hurt. l want him l want him to hurt...
Since l lost the power to pretend that there could ever be a happy ending.
That song is sung out.
This bell is rung out.
He was the light that l'd bless.
He took my last chance ofhappiness.
So, God give me strength.
God, give me strength.
God, give me strength.
God, give me strength.
Give me strength.
Give me strength. l need strength...
What a sad song.
-Sad song.
-Well, it's a little melodramatic.
Oh, no. lt really moved me. l think we should try to make it big. l don't expect it to be a big hit.
No, no. l mean, big sounding. Big. l'm hearing all these things, it's strings or something. lndulgence and decline. l might as well wipe him from my memory.
Fracture the spell as he becomes my enemy...
All right, okay, let's stop.
Okay, stop!
Enough! Stop!
-ls he always like this?
-Yeah, he is.
-lt needs more bite, so between...
-l like it.
...bar 52 and 56, pizz. l want you to play pizz on bar two and three. Yeah.
And what are you doing over there?
You're like stirring oatmeal or something. l need you to... ls everything all right? l need you to really pop this thing like... Really give it a snap.
This is rock 'n' roll.
Okay, this is a pick up from from bar 50, okay?
What the fuck is that drummer doing, man?
Holy shit. Fuck.
See l'm only human l want him to hurt..
Yeah, that's it.
This is the board. lt's got all these cool EQs and knobs that do all these far out things.
-Hey, hands off the console.
-Are you digging the work?
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, man, get up. l never had any idea how much you got involved in the work.
All the arranging and producing is really wild.
Almost finished with your first single.
-Denise Waverly's first single.
-l can't believe it.
Listen, we should do something really cool to celebrate.
Yeah, yeah.
Can you stay here tonight with me?
Yeah. l'd like that a lot. l mean, l gotta get home at some point. l got a kid.
He was the light that l'd bless.
He took my last chance ofhappiness. l don't know. Maybe l put too much of myself in the song.
The whole game's changed now.
Everyone's writing their own material.
With Betty checked into Lexington and Sha Sha getting married, that pretty much puts an end to The Luminaries. l gave Doris some leads on session work out in Los Angeles.
Have you thought about what you're gonna do?
Well, with Matthew dumping
Cheryl, l thought maybe...
-You and Cheryl?
-Nah.
Nothing's going on with us. lt's strictly business. You see?
She was a married lady and l don't mess around.
Geez, does she know how you feel. l mean, do you have a plan? l'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Joel.
Maybe you should, you know, ask her out for dinner and a movie first.
You think that's a better idea?
Oh, well.
Yeah. l do.
Why don't you level with me?
''God Give Me Strength'' broke you.
What?
Get out of here.
Just like a woman to think she's the ruination of a guy.
Look here.
You made me, Denise. l was the laughing stock of this town before you wrote me my first hit and my second, and how many since?
See, you forced me to take chances l would've never had the guts to take alone.
You made me, kiddo.
...makes the heart grow fonder.
How l miss him when he wanders...
Hey, Luma! Hey!
Oh, Jay. You're very bad.
You said you were gonna buy her a puppy, not two puppies. l know.
She couldn't make up her mind.
She looked so adorable holding them both. Edna. lt so adorable. l'm gonna have to call you Edna from now on.
You know, sometimes when l look at you, l see you way in the future as this amazing old lady who's done all this really far out things.
But you don't see that.
What's it gonna take for me... to get you to see your spark? lt's never been this hard.
The feeling taunts me now.
Just me and you.
Me and you.
They all know l'm happy.
They don't like the good things.
Chewing and waving.
-Come on, make a new sound.
-l'm too, too low being sad.
What's wrong with liking good things?
Chewing and waving.
How are we supposed to do that live?
Where are the cars and the surfboards? lt's not The Riptides. l'm not singing that stuff.
Brian, anything to add? l dig the theremin at the end. lt's cool.
-He likes the theremin.
-lt's great, man.
Wow. That's great, man.
Everybody's really fucking happy, huh? lt's great, baby. lt's great.
How can you not like that?
You guys were a little harsh.
-What's it all about?
-The future, man.
The future?
What is that supposed to mean?
You gonna sing about surfboards all your life?
-lt's a metaphor.
-A metaphor? ls it psychedelic?
-Ever heard anything like that before?
-No.
-l liked it.
-l hated it.
Luma, l love that one. l'm gonna put it on the fridge.
What about mine? l don't know if l'll put yours up.
Edna, man, who was down at the studio, man?
My tapes. Somebody fucked with my tapes.
Jay, no one's been in the studio.
We've been here all day.
These boxes are empty!
-Somebody was in the studio.
-No one was in the studio.
Somebody fucked with my tapes. lf they didn't like it...
Calm down.
Don't tell me, Edna!
Jay, l don't even go in the goddamn studio.
The tapes are not in the studio!
Take the kids in the house.
Go ahead, protect them! Who's looking out for me and my songs?
You were talking and kissing ass with those three fucking morons. l write all the songs. l taught 'em how to play.
Would you please stop now?
Fucking empty, man!
Empty! Zilch!
They're missing!
Empty!
For Chrissakes, Jay! l got my eye on you.
All right, Jay.
Secure all windows, all doors.
All access into the house is to be taped and wired.
Down here, we got the studio.
We got an intercom running... up from the studio.
Run your wires down along the steps here.
What about these skylights, man?
-We're putting 'em back in.
-Somebody could come up on the roof.
-You want to secure them?
-Hey, baby.
-You could put bars across them.
-Good morning, Jay.
-Jay?
-Good morning.
Sweetie, what's going on?
Fortification.
This gentleman here is a security expert.
From now on, no one will have access to this room except for you and me.
-That's it.
-Okay.
Sweetie, l'm gonna go see Cheryl.
-l'll see you later. Okay.
-Groovy. Listen man, how about some guard dogs?
-Dogs are good.
-Yeah, we got these puppies...
Jay?
-Yeah?
-What is this?
Those are my tapes. l found them.
You need some Dobies or some Rottweilers.
-Jay, the lost tapes?
-Yeah. l could put a perimeter system right around your board there.
We danced in the sand and the water rose higher and higher. l gotta say, you know, seeing you and this, l really miss... l miss the work, l really do. lf you want to do something again, l'll introduce you to the producer.
He's desperate for people to write.
They need songs every week. l'm inundated. l'm overworked. l gotta tell you. l would really love it.
You're too good for this stuff, but...
Your mom is gonna be proud when she sees this castle.
Hey, what's this? A sand castle?
-lt's a sand fort.
-Oh. lt's a fort.
Listen, l've got some great news. l got a job today.
You got a job?
A job? Really?
Doing what?
Cheryl is friends with the producer, l'm gonna be doing the only thing l know how to do, writing songs.
That's not the only thing you know how to do. You're an artist.
Jay, the artist in me is gonna be writing songs for ''Where The Action ls.''
''The artist in me is gonna be writing songs... for some pop bubble-gum show and l'm really excited about it.''
-Will you listen to yourself?
-What?
You don't need a job.
You have money. lf you're not gonna use it to develop yourself as an artist, then get rid of it.
Throw it away!
Throw it in the fucking ocean!
All right, Jay, l'll get rid of it.
But l gotta report to the set in an hour.
You wanna wish me luck?
Denise, the only thing l wish for you... and l really, sincerely mean this... is that you are fired.
That's nice. l mean that for your own good.
You are doing yourself a disservice.
That's great, Jay.
Thanks. Thanks a lot. l love you!
-l'm gonna do something.
-Watch it. l've been grooving on you for an hour or two.
Thinking ofa way l can get to you.
Come on, girls, this is meant to be upbeat, not uptight!
Get happy!
How can l get
-through to you.
-Before the other girls do.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, see?
...through to you.
-Before the other girls do.
-How can l get...
-What?
-What?
No, it's good. lt's good.
How can l get... l see his eyes in the water blue. l see his hair in the glowing sunlight.
Jay?
A vision clear
Luma? ln Bermudian waters, oh, so clear and cold.
Annie, open the goddamn door.
Annie, what the hell is this?
Annie?
-What is happening?
-Your man flipped his lid.
Only this time, he lost the kids.
-Jay?
-Yeah, Jay.
He took them to the museum and he came home without them.
-Have you called the police?
-Yes, and the kids are okay.
They found them hiding in some old ice cream truck.
Okay, fine.
Why didn't you call me?
You were on the set! l couldn't reach you!
-All right.
-And by the way, he lost my child too, Denise.
-l understand, Annie.
-No, you don't.
Where is Jay?
He dragged the mattress into the studio.
Okay, he's fine.
Let me go speak to Jay...
Go speak to your man,
'cause that's what you need to do.
Don't you dare speak about Jay like that.
Go deal with him! l see his lips
Jay.
My mother, she used to...
She used to sing this song when we were kids.
She had big eyes, like you.
Jay, knock it off.
You lost the kids.
Do you understand that when you come home, you have to have the kids with you?
We were playing.
We were at the museum.
We were having fun.
Howard is gonna be calling any minute, and he's gonna want to speak to Luma.
What am l supposed to tell him?
-What am l supposed to tell him?
-One minute they were there.
One minute they were there?
-And the next minute...
-You would like me to say that one minute they were there, and the next minute they were gone?
Denise, the cops are here.
Oh, Luma, come here, sweetie.
-Did you have a little adventure?
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome. l would be so furious with him.
What am l supposed to do?
People want you to promise through sickness and in health and then they want you to check out the minute there's a problem. l'm his wife.
Am l supposed to walk away from him now that he's in trouble?
Can't do that.
Would he walk out on me if l was falling apart?
-No, of course he wouldn't.
-Well, if you won't leave him then you'd better help him. l don't know how to help him. l'd get him a doctor. l hate doctors.
Okay, artist in crisis.
-That's why people call me.
-Look, look, Doc.
He's been holed up in that studio for three weeks.
Without bathing or talking to anyone. l don't mean to minimise
Jay's state. l apologise.
Are you fearful that you, or your loved ones, are in danger?
No, he'd never hurt, you know, me or Luma, no.
Do you believe he's using narcotics?
Well, l mean, he smokes a little grass...
He does some psychedelics... and mushrooms and peyote.
-But he's down on hard drugs.
-Yeah.
So basically, you want him to know you're concerned and that you care.
And that you want to be reassured that he's okay. l want him to know that l care about him and l want him to know l love him and l... l really want to make sure that he finishes his album.
Because l know how important it is to him. lt's everything. l can help you, okay?
Jay?
A friend of yours stopped by.
Jay, it's Jonesy.
Hey, Jonesy, man.
-What's happening?
-Hey, man, l'd like to come in and rap for a minute.
You know?
Oh, well, l don't know, man. l'm working, l'm real busy. l'm talking to my muse, man.
Maybe you could introduce me to her. l'm single now, you know.
Where are you at, man?
Hey.
There you are.
Man, it is... so far out to see you again.
Going through some changes, huh?
Doctor has brought some... herbal medicine.
Where's the muse? l could use a little inspiration myself.
You know where to find it, man.
The muse.
She lives in the cave where everything you ever lost lives.
But... you have everything, Jay. l had everything. l lost everything. l lost everything that mattered. l lost everything that ever mattered.
'Till l met Denise.
You saw her.
Oh, man.
She's so beautiful.
And her kid.
Left her fucking kid at the museum.
-Suppose you heard about that.
-Jay, listen.
Man, you spaced out.
Man, you know me, man. You know l love kids and l love animals and shit.
-l wouldn't fucking...
-You spaced out, man.
Listen, you're dealing with some heavy shit.
You got people telling you you're the voice of your generation and, ''What's he gonna say next?''
You gotta cut yourself some slack.
Cut Jay some slack and pick up... on the positive vibes.
They're there, man. They're all around you, people who love you.
-That little girl, she loves you.
-Yeah.
That groovy new old lady, man,
-she digs you, she's there for you!
-Yeah, Denise.
Pick up on 'em.
Denise, man, she gave it all back to me.
Yeah. Yeah.
Pick up on that.
Hang on to that.
-Hold on to that, man.
-Jonesy, man.
You got so much, huh?
All right.
Ofa song l thought was yours
But l know life was overrated
Before you walked in through my door
You're so shiny
You're so fine
Come on, wiggle for me
Don't you think it's time? lt's beautiful. lt's so beautiful, Jay.
-lt's so beautiful.
-Yeah? l was so scared, Jay. l was so scared. l thought you didn't love me.
And then you told the doctor that you lost...
That you'd lost everything.
Oh, God.
Don't you think it's time?
Take my love...
Oh, Jay, please don't leave me again, please.
-lt's beautiful, Jay.
-Yeah. You like it? l'm still working on a new ending. l love you.
Now, we have to start working on your new album. l don't know, Jay. Remember, l'm kind of a pacifist, so... l don't know if l feel l should force my work on the public. lt'd be a concept album.
Only it'd be... lt'd be so much better than what we guys are doing.
Because it'd be more personal, genuine.
-Well, maybe someday.
-Baby. l want you to make this record... more than anything l could ever want for myself.
Can you dig that? Can you?
Hey.
You know what, handsome?
Why don't we get you all dressed up and we can go out and go to the
Whiskey and go see Doris sing.
And we'll call Cheryl and get some of the gang and, you know, we'll have a real celebration.
-Yeah, that sounds groovy.
-Really? Yes?
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.
Babe, why don't you run ahead without me? l had a couple of flashes and l want to lay them down before l forget 'em.
You sure?
You run ahead and have fun, and when you come home we'll smoke a little grass and we'll do it 'til the sun comes up.
Go have some fun.
-And listen, by the way.
-Yes?
Your mother?
She was full of shit.
You fit.
You fit just groovy.
Some folks know about it, some don't
Some will learn to shout it, some won't
But sooner or later, baby
There 's a ditty say you're gonna have to get it
Right down to the real nitty gritty
Right down to the real nitty gritty... l fall apart
Every time l picture you
Swallowed by the dark
There is no centre to my life now
No grace in my heart
Man from Mars...
What was the last conversation you had with your husband?
They think it's my fault.
They think it's all my fault.
The silence is so full ofsounds
You're in them all...
Denise, when people take their own lives...
Offin the distance a cool wind is blowing... it's difficult for their souls to let go of this plane. l'm not who l was and l'm not where l'm going...
The reason you can't let go of Jay's memory... l'm so tired ofknowing there 's no way ofknowing... is because his soul still clings to this planet... instead of moving on.
You left me stranded between two worlds
You turned me into a mixed-up girl
You left me stranded between two worlds... l understand, Guru Dave.
But what can l do about it?
Meditate. Pray.
You must visualise
Jay's release for him. ls it nicer where you are?
Do you ever think ofme?
Oh, what's that? Cotton?
-Annie, come on. Guru Dave said that...
-Fuck Guru Dave. l milked goats, churned butter, bailed hay. l planted radishes, magic mushrooms and weed for five goddamn months!
My spiritual lessons are mastered! l saw God! Let's go!
-Goddamn!
-All right, girls!
Get up out of the manure! l'm buying dinner!
Thank you, Lord, for New Yorkers.
-Where you been?
-Denise, l've returned.
-Annie.
-Joel.
Hey, James, how you doing?
Luma.
-Denise.
-l think l know him.
Who's your friend?
How are you? You look great.
-Hey, Joel.
-You look great. l mean, you look great to be so skinny. How are you?
These your friends over here?
-Hey, l love this place.
-Come on, Joel.
-Share with your sister, okay?
-She ain't my sister. l'm almost your sister.
No arguing or you won't get caramel sundaes later.
Denise, eat your hamburger, all right?
You look like a vampire.
All that fresh air and health food'll kill you.
After dinner, you can watch TV in this first-class joint l booked us into.
-l hate it.
-l love it.
-You don't know what's happening...
-Same old Joel.
You going for a swim?
What are you doing? l'm just spacing out, you know. l'm talking to my Jay.
Well, what's that supposed to prove?
Because Guru Dave said that if l can help Jay let go of life, then l'm gonna be okay.
Jay did let go of life.
He drowned himself.
He's dead. You couldn't save him while he was alive and now you're gonna waste your own precious life and Luma's trying to save him after he's dead?
-That makes sense to you?
-Yeah, it does.
You just wouldn't get it.
You just don't get it.
You never will.
Well, l know one thing, that the only sense any of these jerks you've allowed to sidetrack you have had in common, is a belief in your talent, l know that.
Yeah.
Well, you know, talent... is pretty meaningless when someone you love is dead.
Your talent is meaningless to you, Denise. lt always has been.
From day one you were telling me how you wanted to make a record.
-l made a record.
-Yeah.
About a thousand years ago, and it flopped. l put myself out there and they didn't want me.
And they were right.
They were right. l failed and l've accepted it and l have come to peace with it and l've gone on with my life.
And so you give up after one flop, huh? l thought you were tougher.
The last thing l ever took you to be was a coward.
Look at you, out in the mud, pulling up turnips!
You know, l don't need a lecture, okay? l'm a little old for a little pep talk from Joel.
Especially from you. You wouldn't know the first thing about giving yourself to someone, about sharing your life with someone, sharing your pain with them.
You wouldn't know the first thing about it.
You think you're the only one shit happens to, huh?
Well, think again, kiddo. l've had my own disappointments in this secondary existence of a life l live. ln my business, and, yeah, big surprise, in my big dumb heart, and it didn't come from playing it safe.
You said yourself that the very thing Jay wanted was for you to make that record.
-Yeah.
-And if he hasn't let go of life, it's 'cause he's as disgusted as l am to see you sitting here, feeling sorry for yourself and giving up!
Oh, you're fucking disgusted?
You wouldn't even have a life if it wasn't for me!
-That's right!
-You're the fucking leech!
-l am a leech, that's right!
-Yeah, you are!
-That's why l'm here.
-You wouldn't have a life!
-Oh, really?
-You live everything through me!
-So fuck you!
-Fuck me?
-Yeah, fuck you!
-Then fuck off! Fuck you!
-No, fuck you!
-No, fuck you!
That's right, hit me!
Go ahead! Go ahead! l am sad!
And l'm alone. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
No, no... lt's not gonna distort. l want it in the red.
All right, Jay.
Help me out, man. l want a high end on the vocal and to round out the bass.
Whoa, what was that?
Who you talking to?
Joel, l'm talking to Jay
'cause l need his help on the EQs.
As long as it's work-related, you can talk to dead guys.
Thanks.
Everyone is excited about this album.
You realise that?
-Even your old pal.
-Who?
John Murray.
-There's a song about him in here...
-A song for everyone.
-But the guy who stuck around.
-Joel.
Even moved out to this ridiculous town that doesn't deserve to be called a city.
-Joel, let's go to work, okay?
-That's why l'm here.
You guys, that was great.
That was great.
Okay, here we go.
Let's try one.
Come here, sweetie pie.
''A Boat On The Sea,'' take two. This is piano track only.
This one's for you, Joely.
There 's a lamp that won't light in my poetry room
And children out playing and a big full moon
My man's barricaded there in his room
He'll be coming out soon l remember when l met him, he blew in like a wind
No one was more beautiful or dangerous than him
He blew through my soul like a tangerine wind
He'll be coming out soon l never knew l was built so strong
My heart
My heart is a boat on the sea l never thought l was built for hurricanes
My heart
My heart is a boat on the sea
Luxury looms on a fog-bound day l'm not alone now and l'm not afraid l'm clean and l'm free lt's all stripped away
My debts are paid l wonder ifhe ever looks down on the sea
And thinks about the time that he spent with me l know everything's exactly how it has to be
All's right with this world l never knew l was built so strong
My heart
My heart is a boat on the sea l never thought l was built for hurricanes
My heart
My heart is a boat on the sea ln the cold and the dark
You're the grace ofmy heart ln the cold and the dark
You're the grace ofmy heart ln the cold and the dark
You're the grace ofmy heart.
Now l have nothing
So God, give me strength
'Cause l'm weak
And awake
And ifl'm strong l might still break
And l don't have anything to share
That l won't throw away into the air
That song is sung out
This bell is rung out
She was the light that l'd bless
She took my last chance ofhappiness
So God, give me strength
God, give me strength l can hold on to
God, give me strength
When the phone doesn't ring
And l'm lost
And imagining
Everything that kind oflove is worth
As l tumble back down to the earth
That song is sung out
This bell is rung out
She was the light that l'd bless
She took my last chance ofhappiness
So God, give me strength
God if she'd grant me her indulgence and decline l might as well
Wipe her from my memory
Fracture the spell
As she becomes my enemy
And maybe l was washed out
Like a lip print on his shirt
See, l'm only human l want him to hurt l want him l want him to hurt
Since l lost the power to pretend
That there could ever be a happy ending
That song is sung out
This bell is rung out
She was the light that l'd bless
She took my last chance ofhappiness
So God, give me strength
God, give me strength
Wipe her from my memory l might as well
God, give me strength...

{1629}{1682}- How do ya mean by...|- Joe, what do ya... How do ya...
{1721}{1766}What do you mean by Hard Core?
{1768}{1849}Move or fuckin' die.
{1851}{1914}If I want your cigarette,|I will come and get it.
{1915}{1970}I will take it from you.
{1971}{2018}But if you were smart,|you'll just give it to me.
{2019}{2071}Because that way,|it avoids confrontation.
{2217}{2312}A little while ago, Bucky Haight|got shot on his farm in the Prairies.
{2314}{2373}Nobody's sure if it was|a Chapman-Lennon thing...
{2375}{2425}or some kind of|stalking thing.
{2427}{2499}What we do know is he was shot,|and both his legs were amputated.
{2501}{2546}- Both?|- Both of'em were.
{2547}{2606}- I just heard it was one leg.|- I just got the call.
{2607}{2674}- Both of'em were amputated.|- I think it was one.
{2675}{2724}- I just... Johnny.|- Okay, okay, sorry.
{2751}{2806}Both... Both of'em...
{2807}{2898}were cut off just above the fuckin'...|just below the knee.
{2899}{2977}It's a stump, anyway.|That's what I heard.
{2979}{3061}And, uh... So, this|beneft concert's for him.
{3063}{3135}Fuckin'Chapman shoots Lennon, right?|Rock and roll assassination.
{3136}{3183}Cobain... rock and roll suicide.
{3184}{3257}Fuckin'Marvin Gaye. The guy's|old man shoots him in the head.
{3259}{3307}That's fuckin'nice.|Do you know what I mean?
{3309}{3377}Bucky Haight. That motherfucker|was a fuckin'huge influence.
{3379}{3429}I love that guy. If it wasn't|for him, I wouldn't be here.
{3431}{3477}You know what I'm sayin'?
{3479}{3563}That motherfucker was fuckin'robbed,|and that's what pisses me off.
{3565}{3620}It's payback time. I owe him.|This is for him.
{3718}{3764}So what have you|been doing for fiive years, Joe?
{3766}{3813}Whatever I want. I don't know.
{3815}{3861}Fuckin'around.|I get by.
{3863}{3922}Play a little fuckin'acoustic gig|once in a while. I'm Joe Dick.
{3923}{3990}People come and see that. This is|different. The whole band's together.
{3991}{4086}It's not just theJoe Dick Show.|This is a band. This is a gang.
{4087}{4151}How does, uh,|Pipe contribute to this gang?
{4153}{4233}When he's not|a fuckin'freak of nature,
{4235}{4309}he's-he's bright and he's|really good at what he does.
{4311}{4374}He's a tough little fuck|on his own merit, you know.
{4375}{4458}If there was ever a problem, Pipe would|be in there in a second, and he's nuts.
{4459}{4518}Uh, so tell me about the last tour.
{4519}{4586}I know you had some problems|with, uh, Oxenberger.
{4587}{4642}He's a gang member.|He had some problems.
{4644}{4692}He had, like, a breakdown,|and he's fiine now.
{4694}{4759}He's still Johnny to us.|Always will be, you know?
{4761}{4856}If people have problems you don't|abandon them, unless you're a fucker.
{4915}{4988}So Joe, when was|the last time you saw Billy Tallent?
{4990}{5054}He got on a plane|to somewhere being a big shot,
{5056}{5103}so I haven't seen him|for a while.
{5105}{5195}But, you know, I miss him.|He'll be back. Always is.
{5197}{5243}When he says he's gonna be somewhere,|he's there.
{5245}{5324}He may not enjoy it.|He'll bitch, but he'll be there.
{5326}{5372}What are you asking me?
{5534}{5620}I grew up with Hard Core Logo.|I have all their albums.|I just totally love them.
{5622}{5673}They're amazing.|You know what I mean?
{5675}{5722}They're not just people|who are talking about stuff.
{5724}{5791}They're people who are... who are|making it happen, who are doing it.
{5793}{5857}Bucky Haight was a really|good friend of mine.
{5859}{5959}When someone shoots your friend,|you gotta do something about it.
{5961}{6030}You know, what Hard Core Logo are doing|is a really cool thing.
{6031}{6122}When Joe Dick contacted me|about a beneft...
{6123}{6170}for his friend Bucky Haight,
{6171}{6266}I thought it was an excellent way|to raise awareness about this issue|for younger people.
{6267}{6334}joe called me up and said...
{6335}{6410}he had some record company money to fiilm|a reunion show at the Commodore.
{6411}{6458}He made me an offer|I couldn't refuse.
{6459}{6507}And, uh, I said,|"I'll be there."
{6863}{6947}You better leave me alone
{6949}{7004}You better leave me alone
{7006}{7063}You better leave me alone
{7064}{7156}Skanky stupid girls|Skanky stupid girls
{7158}{7246}Castrate me|Skanky stupid girls
{7406}{7471}- How are you doin'?
{7472}{7515}How's it goin'?
{7542}{7588}Did you just get off the plane?
{7653}{7699}Art.
{8466}{8536}Bucky Haight has been shot.
{8538}{8587}Luckily, he's alive.
{8589}{8644}But countless others are dead|because our government...
{8646}{8717}still allows guns to be|purchased in this country.
{8719}{8792}Make guns illegal!
{8794}{8875}And now, breaking|fiive years of silence,
{8876}{8977}Vancouver's favorite|bad boys of punk,
{8979}{9062}Hard Core Logo!
{9268}{9327}You people,|you're the fuckin' coolest!
{9517}{9564}You see,|I was just lying there,
{9565}{9657}'cause I saw you cut your fuckin'|ponytails, you stupid fuckin' cunts.
{9659}{9720}That wasn't very nice.
{9722}{9786}You'd think there was|a fuckin' punk rock revival on.
{9826}{9879}You don't know shit|from good chocolate, babies.
{10282}{10344}I'll fuck you when|I say I'm ready

{12181}{12254}Guitar!
{12696}{12758}Not bad for four guys|who haven't played together in a while.
{12798}{12844}- Surprised?|- Yeah, I think we won.
{12846}{12892}- We won too.|- We won.
{12894}{12973}jenifur. How serious is this?

{13288}{13373}So, Jenifur... Jenifur...|Is it a done deal?
{13375}{13450}It's not done completely. Not yet.|I'm just waiting for some papers.

{13572}{13681}- You get paid.|- Yeah, I'm makin' money|for the frst fuckin' time.
{13683}{13751}It's much different|than Joe and the boys.
{13752}{13799}joe seemed pretty happy you were here.
{13800}{13847}He seemed a little worried|you weren't even gonna show up.
{13848}{13933}Well, you know,|he's a bitch.

{16313}{16377}Slow down.|No staying in the vans,
{16379}{16453}you book hotels,|and we don't stay at any band houses.
{16455}{16503}Okay, I lost you|after "I'll go."
{16505}{16551}That's all.|That's what I liked.
{16553}{16608}And I don't wanna have|to baby-sit you.
{16645}{16711}- I've been both a mother|and a father to you.|- Shut up.
{16713}{16760}- Fuck off.|- That's not buddies.
{16762}{16851}That's not buddies.|I got something for ya.
{16853}{16897}just so you know|I'm thinking about you.
{16899}{17012}It's a picture that I got when I saw it.|And it's of you and I liked it.
{17014}{17092}Put it in a frame and dust it off,|if I can fuckin' fnd it.
{17137}{17199}Oh! Got it.
{17400}{17446}Put batteries in it.
{17484}{17556}- That's not buddies.|- It's funny, though.
{17558}{17641}- To me, it's funny.|- When I get back I'm done, right?
{17642}{17705}- Yeah.|- No, say it. Mean it.

{17804}{17864}- "When I get back, I'm done."|- "When I get back, I'm done."
{17937}{18000}- That didn't make any fuckin' sense.|- So?
{18002}{18049}You asked me to say it,|I did it.
{18051}{18097}Anything else|you'd like from me?
{18099}{18157}- What are we doing today? Hey!
{18158}{18237}Where did Billy go?|Where's Billy?
{18239}{18314}Billy's gone.|Uh-oh. Where's Billy?
{18316}{18363}- Billy...
{18365}{18448}Man, you scare the shit out of me|when you time-travel like that.

{18661}{18722}- I'm right here!|You don't even care when I'm gone.
{18724}{18780}When you're gone, I look for you.|I make an effort.
{18781}{18848}I'm gone. Wow, he's gone.|He doesn't even look.
{18849}{18909}That's not buddies.|That's not a fun game.
{18944}{19035}You're still|a contrary motherfucker.
{19095}{19146}It'll be fun.
{19148}{19247}Oh, my goodness.|My life is just so complex.
{19612}{19702}They can ride that whole punk|nostalgia thing as long as they want.
{19704}{19752}It'll be a piece of cake|to book the tour.
{19754}{19844}And with Billy playing guitar|forJenifur, that's gonna pull|in some more people as well.
{19845}{19925}Not to take anything away from Joe|and the other guys. They're good guys.
{19926}{20045}Say they make six Gs,|and they take my 1 5%,
{20048}{20095}the van, the food, gas,
{20097}{20190}hotel, four guys,|3,000 miles, fiive nights.
{20192}{20256}- At this point,|you do it for love, you know?
{20257}{20308}john John, it's Joe.
{20309}{20357}We got an advance from Mulligan,|Billy's in.
{20359}{20429}So pack your bags. It looks like|we got ourselves a convoy, you copy?
{20430}{20494}I lined up a van.|I got a great fuckin'deal.
{20496}{20580}That fiilm crew's coming with us.|They're making a movie about us.
{20582}{20651}So get a note from Celine, get a note|from your doctor, whoever, man.
{20653}{20772}Don't blow this.|6.:00 a.m. 6.:00 a.m. Be there.
{21664}{21710}November, 5.:00 a.m.
{21712}{21832}Why the hell are two grown men|still calling themselves|joe Dick and Billy Tallent?
{21834}{21916}When they gave themselves|those names, they were 1 6, 1 7.
{21918}{22021}The question is, when do they stop|using them? Forty? Fifty? Sixty?
{22022}{22069}You wonder if they remember|their real selves...
{22070}{22117}joe Mulgrew, Bill Boisy.
{22118}{22221}Then there's Pipe.|Can't even remember his real name.
{22223}{22308}I used to want a punk handle too.|I just couldn't fiind one that fiit.
{22310}{22406}It was always John.|john. John Oxenberger.
{22408}{22469}john, John, John,|the bass player.
{22471}{22552}john from Hard Core Logo.
{22554}{22638}Maybe I never had a real self|to throw away like those guys.
{22714}{22823}After a certain age,|it's hard to, uh, make friends.
{22825}{22918}And I've knownJoe|since I was 1 3.
{22919}{22966}And, uh...
{23018}{23118}I love him more than|anybody I've met since.
{23180}{23226}Pipe's a freak of nature.
{23294}{23347}AndJohn, well,|there's his whole condition.
{23558}{23604}- Hard Core Logo.|- Yeah, Hard Core Logo.
{23608}{23694}* Which way you goin; Billy *
{23760}{23827}- You think we should wake him up?|-  No.
{23829}{23875}- What do you think?|- No.
{23914}{23972}Look at this.|I got it off the board at the Commodore.
{23974}{24031}- It totally rocks.|-  How much did it cost?
{24033}{24091}It takes money|to make money, John.
{24163}{24212}- It's a spur of the moment thing.|- Yeah.
{24214}{24266}- Boom!|- You did the drawing?
{24268}{24314}Yeah.
{24414}{24460}It looks like a bootleg.
{24462}{24518}- Fuck you it does.|- No, it looks like a bootleg.
{24519}{24578}Look at the...|It looks like a bootleg.
{24627}{24674}- It does.|- Yeah.
{24719}{24766}Fuck you.|It's perfect.
{24934}{25002}- It looks like a bootleg.|- Yeah, it does.|It looks like a bootleg.
{25003}{25054}- You wanna know why?|- Why?
{25056}{25102}Because it's a bootleg.
{25148}{25207}Well, at the peak of our fame,
{25209}{25255}we had it all together.
{25257}{25314}We'd sell a million t-shirts|a night.
{25316}{25406}We managed ourselves. We had great|hotel rooms. We had everything.
{25407}{25464}Tons of booze on the Ryder,|a driver.
{25466}{25544}You know, it was...|It was working for us.
{25546}{25623}That was before Ed Festus|showed up and fucked it all up.
{25625}{25713}joe brought in Ed Festus|to manage us.
{25714}{25765}Good contacts there,
{25767}{25815}talk of a, uh,
{25817}{25871}a major label signing us.
{25873}{25945}We were a band for 1 2 years.|We were simply a band for 1 2 years.
{25946}{25993}And then we stopped being one.|That's it.
{25994}{26075}And money caused|a lot of tension.
{26077}{26125}Well, it was like,|we were playing New York City.
{26127}{26188}It's our last night, right?|Last gig, we're playing New York.
{26190}{26289}joe always had a thing|for the grand gesture.
{26290}{26367}President of Sire Records is sittin'|there, right in front of the stage.
{26369}{26417}We're halfway through|"Something's Gonna Die."
{26419}{26488}joe jumps up on the table,
{26490}{26540}drops his fuckin' pants...
{26542}{26602}It's personal.|You had to be there.
{26604}{26704}and then pisses into|Seymour Stein's gin and tonic...
{26706}{26810}and then yells into the mike,|"Hey, see if you can sell that,|you corporate weasel!"
{26811}{26887}I mean, talk about game over,|you know what I mean?
{26889}{26980}He'd just fuck it up because|he didn't want that next level.|He didn't wanna step up.
{26982}{27034}There's two different ways|to look at it.
{27036}{27098}Billy just wants|the models and limousines,
{27099}{27161}and I'm happy with|the hookers and taxi cabs.
{27163}{27225}Addiction, um,
{27227}{27300}is a gamble, and the gamble is that|you're losing most of the time.
{27302}{27389}And losing is a place|that you're most happy.
{27391}{27437}ForJoe, I think that's...
{27439}{27534}So what, are you playing us|off against each other?
{27536}{27602}So that would make you|kind of a cunt, wouldn't it?
{27606}{27663}It's the best thing|we've done yet, negative boy.
{27726}{27798}You people,|you're the fuckin'coolest.
{27846}{27966}You see, I was just lying there, 'cause|I saw you cut your...
{27968}{28015}Fuck!
{28054}{28121}Hey, are we gonna stop|and eat soon?
{28254}{28306}You fuckin' stopped!
{28308}{28355}You stopped at fuckin'Herbies!
{28356}{28416}Turn the fuck around|right now, John.
{28418}{28464}- I'm fuckin' serious.|- You snooze, you lose.
{28466}{28564}Hey, did I or did I not say,|"When we go to Herbies, wake me up"?
{28566}{28626}- No!|- Fuck that!
{28628}{28747}You guys know I love Herbies.|If you don't fuckin'pull|this van over and turn around,
{28748}{28820}I'm gonna... I'm gonna|fuckin' piss right here.
{28822}{28889}-  You snooze, you lose.|- I'm gonna piss.
{28891}{28950}- Piss in a bottle, you little piglet.|-  Pull over, John.
{28952}{29017}- Nope. Nope. I'm gonna piss right here.|- John, pull over.
{29019}{29083}- Keep driving.|- I'm gonna piss right here!
{29085}{29182}It's gonna blow!|It's gonna blow, baby!
{29184}{29245}Okay, we'll stop. Pull over, Johnny.
{29247}{29306}Pull it over.|That's buddies.
{29308}{29384}Now, sit down,|fucking cunt.
{29386}{29441}My leg!

{30763}{30809}Okay, bye.
{30839}{30914}Hey, do you have|a girlfriend, Bruce?
{30916}{30997}-  Yeah. Okay, cut.|- You should call her.
{31321}{31402}The tour is gonna be|fuckin'fantastic, man.
{31403}{31450}I mean, it's ripping.|Our tunes are ripping.
{31451}{31511}Our set is as solid as a rock.|As long as we can keep...
{31512}{31598}the fuckin' mentals|fuckin' together,
{31600}{31659}then everything's|gonna be great.
{31660}{31735}This time it's a lot different, because|I thinkJoe's not such a dick anymore.
{31737}{31800}He's still spittin'|in my face all the time.
{31802}{31867}I'm gettin'used to|that spit thing, you know.
{31868}{31935}I think we're gonna go|all the way with it this time,
{31936}{32034}unless he dies in a bizarre gardening|accident or something like that.
{32349}{32458}You know, I see, like, if we can|get successful, it's, like, "L-L, "man...
{32460}{32508}limos and Lear jets.
{32510}{32567}That's what I want...|limos and Learjets.
{32568}{32615}I thinkJoe's|a little let down...
{32651}{32707}that Billy's leaving.
{32708}{32771}'Cause, you know, Billy's got|bigger and better things to do, right?
{32773}{32846}I don't know. He's a good shit.|He's got his shit together.
{32848}{32895}Because obviously, he's got|something going on after this.
{32897}{32943}I don't have fuck all.
{33092}{33154}I'd say keep the whole thing|together really, basically.
{33156}{33243}I mean, I'm a little bit of an asshole|sometimes, because they're all pricks.
{33245}{33316}That's the way it works, though.|Keeps each other on our toes.
{33796}{33847}Pipe, load in.|Billy, tune the strings.
{33848}{33895}john, you draw up a set list.
{33896}{33947}- And what are you gonna do?|- Manage.

{36421}{36495}or Montreal with its|separatist chain-smoker faces.
{36497}{36551}I always felt welcome here.
{36552}{36632}They are nonjudgmental faces.|They do what they're told.
{36633}{36707}Things will be|different then

{37670}{37737}When I frst got down to L.A.,|I was jamming with Trevor. You know him.
{37739}{37831}- Yeah.|- And then Earl got sick,|and I fiilled in on a couple dates.
{37832}{37879}So offiicially,|you're part of the band...
{37880}{37927}- No, not yet.|- Or you're just a hired hand?
{37928}{37979}Uh...
{37981}{38035}- Um...|- What are we talking about here?
{38036}{38115}- Are you recording|with their next record too?|- What are we talking about here?
{38185}{38271}- Hey, I don't know.|- Ask some more Hard Core Logo questions.
{38273}{38319}Okay. Joe Dick,
{38320}{38388}you once said the music industry|was the stupidest, sleaziest,
{38389}{38436}most boring business|in the entire world.
{38437}{38503}- Still feel that way?|- Yes, I do.
{38504}{38551}The music industry,|not the music.
{38552}{38599}Rock and roll|is a fuckin' sales tool.
{38601}{38700}It sells beer, swimmin' pools|and movie stars.
{38701}{38768}So, uh,|I read an article...
{38770}{38888}where Ed Festus calls you one of the top|fve thrash guitarists of all time.
{38922}{39041}Ed Festus has Bill Tallent|in his hip pocket.
{39042}{39103}- Does that bug you?|- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
{39105}{39179}In fact, I hate it.|Could you change the subject, please?
{39181}{39228}Ed Festus said you two...
{39229}{39308}fought like some tanked-up white trash|married couple in a trailer park.
{39309}{39369}Well, some of that's true.
{39371}{39443}But that's what makes our music|and our art great.
{39499}{39555}- All right.|- I suffer for his art.
{39557}{39622}- That's what keeps you honest.
{39624}{39680}So, Mr. Dick,
{39682}{39735}does Hard Core Logo|have a future?
{39817}{39883}Mm-hmm.|Yes, it does, Tiffany.
{39885}{39944}- Could you do me just one favor?|- Sure.
{39945}{40008}Can you fuck off?
{40210}{40267}You're good with people.
{40269}{40361}Fantastic.|Chicks dig it.
{40363}{40409}- You love it.|- I think that went well.
{40411}{40457}It felt good.
{40508}{40572}So how are you gettin'|to and from your rehearsal spot?
{40574}{40624}- Uh, limo.|- Limo?
{40625}{40677}No way!|Are you serious?

{40972}{41060}"I got this babe|in a bikini cleaning my pool,|and I can't make it to the phone now."

{44272}{44321}He marries Doris because|he's in love with her.
{44323}{44384}But then he feels|he doesn't deserve her love,
{44385}{44445}so he smashes his car up.
{44447}{44493}- I think I saw it. Does he die?|- Of course he...
{44495}{44545}No, no, he doesn't.|He marries Doris,

{44910}{45021}High noon.|Had my flying dream again last night.
{45023}{45113}I'm free riding the thermals|over a rocky beach and whoosh,
{45115}{45208}all the air gets sucked out of the sky|by some god with a straw.
{45210}{45348}And I fall, watching the rocks grow|larger below rushing up to meet my face.
{45350}{45413}And I know if I hit them,|I'll never wake up.
{45415}{45497}I know I'm going to feel|my teeth breaking into my mouth,
{45498}{45567}and my skull shattering|and my brain splashing...
{45569}{45628}like wet clay|into the tidal pools.
{45630}{45689}As I fall, I know|this is no benign passing...
{45690}{45745}from one world|to a better one,
{45747}{45810}but a jolt of unimaginable|and pointless pain...
{45812}{45913}before a total and fiinal negation|and erasure of all that I am.
{45914}{45961}So I fiigure|I'd better wake up.
{45962}{46019}All told,|a shitty night's sleep.
{46021}{46083}joe hasn't slept in something|like 3 2 hours.

{46600}{46677}It's good, and sometimes...

{46812}{46885}What would happen if you forgot things?
{47061}{47109}Then I would be lost,

{58156}{58212}and Joe nailed Billy|when he passed out.
{58253}{58300}Anyways, it's vague.
{58501}{58548}What-What's your name?
{58587}{58633}I'm Mary.
{59235}{59292}Every town, man.
{59293}{59340}There they are.|Let's see.
{59341}{59392}joanna and Tracy.
{59394}{59445}Prairie girls,|born and bred.
{59499}{59594}Finished high school together,|hightailed it right here|to the big smoke.
{59596}{59642}And they share a basement|apartment with eight cats.
{59747}{59794}joanna did a year|at Wascana College.
{59796}{59855}Got bored, smoked dope.
{59857}{59932}Now she works the OrangeJulius stand|at the fucking Northgate Mall.
{59934}{60033}That's okay, 'cause she's got her eye on|that cute guy who works at Le Chateau.
{60035}{60114}But she's worried that her friends|will think that he's a homosexual.
{60116}{60211}Tracy there, with the Karla Homolka|hairdo, works right here.
{60213}{60289}Tonight's her night off.|But that's cool too,
{60291}{60348}'cause all her friends|are right here.
{60451}{60549}See the old guy in the hat?|That's Virgil King.
{60551}{60629}He used to work|his daddy's farm.
{60667}{60722}Forty years of sweatin' shit.
{60724}{60801}The recession hit.|Kids left,
{60803}{60903}he started drinking, his wife left,|lost the whole deal.
{60905}{60966}Found God, lost God,|kept drinking.
{60995}{61070}Now he just... waits.
{61210}{61262}Anyway, this Jenifur thing...
{61264}{61368}I've got no problem with you|going down there. You record and tour.
{61369}{61428}The rest of the year|you spend with us.
{61430}{61480}jenifur's your side gig.
{61482}{61553}You can do whatever the fuck|you want. That's our policy.|Has been, always will be.
{61608}{61674}- Did you ever sleep with Mary?|- What?
{61676}{61737}- Did you ever sleep with Mary?|- No.
{61741}{61786}I fucked her in the back|of the van, though.
{61872}{61925}Fantastic.
{61927}{61997}Five, six years ago,|last tour?
{61999}{62054}Way longer than that.
{62056}{62103}Um, are you guys in a band?
{62105}{62156}Yes, we are.|Snow Axe.
{62204}{62258}I'm Pipe Feltcher,|and this here is John.
{62260}{62325}- And you are?|- Good looking.
{62327}{62373}- Working.|- Bonus.
{62375}{62436}- No, no, no, no.|- Turn that off.
{62917}{62961}Where are you going, Billy?
{62963}{63028}Uh, bank machine to get some money,|pay the hotel bill.
{63030}{63077}What's wrong?
{63079}{63147}Uh, Joe,|fuck-head that he is,
{63149}{63232}partied with Thelma and Louise,|and they fucked off with our cash.
{63234}{63323}- So you don't have any money?|- No. You got any money?
{63325}{63384}- No.|- You got a smoke?
{63414}{63461}Thanks, man.
{63559}{63624}Welcome to the old days.
{63625}{63680}Fuck.
{64569}{64643}Closed.|I don't fucking believe this.
{64645}{64759}- Joe, what the fuck is this?|- It wasn't fucking closed last week|when Mulligan booked it.
{64761}{64809}So shut your fuckin'mouth.
{64811}{64863}Looks like their license was revoked.
{64925}{64992}Fantastic. What are you gonna|do now, Joe, manage?
{64993}{65073}Do yourself a favor, Billy,|and fuck off.
{65075}{65145}So, uh, what do we do,|uh, now?
{65147}{65230}Last night I sold fuckin'|20 t-shirts and made 1 00 bucks.
{65232}{65301}And then you fuckin' lost it,|so shut up!
{65302}{65373}Look, Pipe Feltcher, I've told you|fve times that I'm fuckin' sorry.
{65374}{65421}So you shut the fuck up!
{65423}{65478}Um, I tell you what.|I got a proposal for you.
{65480}{65526}You take all the money I got,
{65528}{65606}and then the next fuckin' place we stop|by, you can just give it all away.
{65608}{65672}You cheap fuck.|You must have some money,
{65673}{65768}'cause you've been hogging down|the deli trays and you can't be|spending your per diems on food.
{65769}{65860}Oh, so I suppose you want|your per diems back now, Mr. So and So.
{65861}{65917}- Fuck, you're an idiot.|- Well, you're a kook.
{65918}{65965}- No, you're a fuckin' idiot.|- And you're a kook.
{65966}{66050}- You gave him your per diems.|You gave him your per diems.
{66052}{66098}- No, I love it. It's cool.|- What? What?
{66100}{66146}Los Angeles!
{66148}{66236}Billy fucking Hollywood.|Billy fucking Hollywood.
{66237}{66304}- Billy Hollywood. See ya, Slash.|- Yeah!
{66305}{66361}- See ya, Slash. Rock on.|- Yeah!
{66363}{66443}- More! More! More! More!|We want Billy!|- Rock on.
{66445}{66519}- We want Billy!|- Call 91 1. We hurt his feelings.
{66559}{66607}Go nuts, Slash.|Go nuts, Slash.
{66702}{66755}Me and Billy decide|everything about the band,
{66757}{66813}- Oh, fuck.|- About the way this|thing's shot, everything.
{66815}{66874}- We decide fuckin' everything.|- Yeah, we're just the roadies.
{66876}{66938}That's basically it|and everything you do.
{66940}{66990}See, we have positions|we call "the band."
{66992}{67044}- Number one, number two,|- We gotta unpluck his underwear for him.
{67045}{67112}which is basically the same thing,|and then three.
{67113}{67203}- Four's cool, but three's fuckin'...|- Five is Zeak Street.
{67205}{67289}- He doesn't wear any underwear.|I forgot.|- If we're makin'...
{67291}{67337}If we're makin' movies,
{67339}{67388}Feltcher would be an extra,|put it that way.
{67390}{67476}- Ho number one after that.|- There is no such thing as that for you.
{67478}{67576}There's only one number one...|always will be, always have... me.
{67578}{67640}But number two, they kind of coexist,|so there's no big deal.
{67690}{67748}Anger only works|for so long.
{67749}{67836}You can only be angry for so long,|and then you get, uh...
{67870}{67960}It-It turns in on yourself,|and you're a bitter man.
{67962}{68044}You become a bitter man,|and that's no place to go.
{68126}{68180}- You know what I mean?|- I think so.
{68182}{68264}- Yeah?|- I think so.
{68266}{68354}You need people around you|to tell you where you are.
{68356}{68403}Well, 'cause people|buy the shtick, right?
{68405}{68451}You're angry,|everybody gets angry.
{68453}{68499}It looks like|it's about the music,
{68501}{68565}but people buy into the anger|of it rather than, you know...
{68566}{68643}I have fun doing it.|The band has fun doing it.
{68645}{68691}But we're not all just,|like, angry...
{68693}{68797}joe's angry, but I'm not as angry|as I used to be.
{68799}{68846}I don't care to be.
{68847}{68914}You're not jealous|at all of Billy's, uh...
{68916}{68972}A little.|Quite honestly, a little.
{68974}{69020}But I'm jealous that|he's playing with somebody else.
{69022}{69095}I'm not jealous of the money|trip or the fuckin' fame.
{69097}{69143}- So, uh...|- That's not what it's about.
{69145}{69209}So what are you gonna do|when you're 45?
{69211}{69285}Well, it depends on how far|my alcoholism goes.
{69287}{69389}If I stop drinking and my liver's not|a colostomy bag to match my shoes,
{69390}{69442}then I'll probably be okay.
{69444}{69490}I've got it together now.|This fuck...
{69492}{69552}This gig at the Commodore|will be a great gig.
{69554}{69631}Still be playing in a rock and roll band|when you're 45?
{69633}{69731}I'll still be writing songs,|you know.
{69733}{69785}And if Billy's into it...
{69787}{69895}and ifJohn and Piper are around,|I'll be doing it.
{69897}{69949}And if they're interested,|they'll be doing it with me.
{69950}{70044}And if not,|we'll see what happens.
{70306}{70404}S-Sometimes,|when you-you look in the mirror,
{70435}{70482}you-you wonder...
{70483}{70557}what it would be like|if I were honest...
{70559}{70669}every moment for|the rest of my life.
{70670}{70731}Save it for your group sessions, John.
{70733}{70799}N-N-No, Joe.
{70801}{70925}Let's be honest.|Y-Y-You'd be nowhere without Billy.
{70927}{71023}You're just too much|of a coward to admit it.
{71025}{71081}Profound words|from Ernest fucking Hemingway.
{71082}{71129}A-A-And Billy,
{71130}{71196}if you were honest|with yourself,
{71235}{71308}you'd admit that theJenifur gig|has been cancelled.
{71310}{71385}- John, shut the fuck up!|-  What?
{71386}{71444}- A-A-And Pipe?|-  What?
{71446}{71492}What's this aboutJenifur, Bill?
{71494}{71577}- This is just a last tango|before a lifetime spent...|- Bill?
{71578}{71640}as a garbageman.
{71642}{71690}Oh. You know what you are?
{71690}{71705}Oh. You know what you are?
{71707}{71802}You're a schizo, man. You're on|a holiday from fucking lithium.
{71803}{71894}You belong in|a fucking straightjacket.
{71895}{71955}What's this aboutJenifur, Bill?
{71957}{72011}What's this aboutJenifur, Bill?
{72067}{72136}Hey! Stop that fuckin'shit!
{72138}{72184}johnny!

{72554}{72608}- Okay,|let's get a few things in the open.
{72610}{72667}Pipe, the hotel guy|in Regina called.
{72669}{72788}You shit on the fuckin' pillow, wiped|your ass with the fuckin' bedspread.
{72790}{72861}Hey, you know, that's uncool. I don't|get that. What the fuck is that?
{72863}{72910}- Didn't have no toilet paper, man.|- No, that's nuts.
{72912}{72958}johnny?
{72960}{73012}Your fuckin' writing is nuts.
{73014}{73085}You're not taking your medicine. You're|fuckin' fueling something dangerous.
{73087}{73160}- What do you know about danger?|Danger, Will Robinson.|- Johnny, I'm trying to help you.
{73162}{73228}- Danger, Will Robinson.|Danger, Will Robinson.|- Johnny, I'm trying to help you.
{73230}{73290}- I'm trying to help you!|You gotta relax!
{73292}{73339}We got three days left,|and you gotta chill.
{73341}{73434}I'm your friend and you gotta chill.|You must listen to me.
{73435}{73502}Hey, what about Billy?|Doesn't he get a little spanking too?
{73503}{73573}That's true, that's true. Bill,|I guess we can can the rock star shit.
{73574}{73646}- What are you gonna do?|- No! I'm just saying|we can can the rock star shit.
{73648}{73726}- Fuck-up.|- That's all. Thanks.

{74023}{74109}- And fuck you too!|- Oh, fuck you, Mr. Rock Star No More.
{74111}{74184}No more rock star.

{74421}{74495}- We got two nights to kill.|- I'm not stayin' in the van.
{74497}{74545}Hey, why don't we stop by|Bucky's place, man?
{74547}{74614}- The motherfucker's laid up. We can't.|- We'll just phone him.
{74615}{74679}- He doesn't have a phone. Let's go.|- Then we'll stop in.
{74681}{74746}A little hero worship from|the great fucking Joe Dick.
{74747}{74814}Do him a world of good, huh?|Don't you think?
{74815}{74865}- Yes. Yeah.|- Don't you think? Don't you think?
{74867}{74913}Yeah.

{75559}{75627}Thank you.|This next one's for Bucky Haight.
{75629}{75720}Man's got no legs because some|fuckin'psycho with a fuckin'shotgun...
{75722}{75816}hunted him down like an animal|and blew his fuckin'legs off.
{75818}{75864}Yeah!
{75931}{75993}Um...
{75995}{76049}The frst time I met|the Bucky Haight...
{76051}{76100}was in the Dick's kitchen.
{76102}{76150}Um,
{76152}{76217}he was singing|the smartest songs I ever heard.
{76219}{76276}And Joe just idolized him.
{76278}{76324}I think he's a dink.
{76326}{76416}I always tried to getJoe|away from him musically.
{76418}{76470}I taughtJoe, you know,
{76472}{76530}your Townshend,|you know, whatever.
{76531}{76583}just the classics.
{76585}{76683}And the only music that, uh,|infiuenced Joe Dick...
{76685}{76753}was, uh, Bucky Haight.
{76755}{76802}To me, anyway,|he's like...
{76803}{76895}he's like a classic... like a member|of the Rolling Stones almost.
{76896}{76943}A lot of people|really haven't heard of Bucky.
{76944}{76991}I know. See?|That's what I mean.
{76992}{77043}It's like,|the guys who get famous...
{77045}{77115}talk about people|who got them on the road,
{77116}{77164}and those people are nothing.
{77166}{77230}Well, like, you know,|will a big rock star...
{77232}{77311}cut their inspirer a check?
{77313}{77368}No, I don't think so.|They'll just talk about him.
{77370}{77416}It doesn't pay the fuckin'|bills though, does it?
{77491}{77537}Bucky!
{77789}{77835}Good morning.
{77939}{77987}Dick Joe, Bucky's still got...
{77989}{78035}Shut up!
{78127}{78174}Shut up!
{78203}{78249}Shut up!
{78251}{78314}Fuckin' Chapman shoots Lennon, right?|Rock and roll assassination.
{78316}{78363}Cobain... rock and roll suicide.
{78364}{78447}Fuckin' Marvin Gaye. The guy's|old man shoots him in the head.
{78449}{78495}That's fuckin' nice.|Do you know what I mean?
{78497}{78567}Bucky Haight. That motherfucker|was a fuckin' huge infiuence.
{78568}{78618}I love that guy. If it wasn't|for him, I wouldn't be here.
{78619}{78666}You know what I'm saying?
{78667}{78754}That motherfucker was fuckin' robbed,|and that's what pisses me off.
{78756}{78806}It's payback time. I owe him.|This is for him.
{78808}{78855}Okay? Can you shut|that fucker off?
{78971}{79053}So is Bucky...|Is Bucky in on this too?
{79055}{79113}We gotta get|a fuckin'microphone in there.
{79115}{79169}I'm not getting much.
{79228}{79279}Okay, hold on.|Bruce, look at this. Check this out.
{79281}{79327}This is cool.
{79329}{79384}- There he is.
{79459}{79505}Fucker.
{79642}{79690}I kind of bullshitted you|about...
{79692}{79759}Bucky's legs,|as you can see.
{79761}{79830}But, fuck, Billy wouldn't have gone|for any of this shit if I hadn't,
{79832}{79903}so I locked in.
{79905}{79961}- So you used|the benefiit money for this?|- Yeah.
{79963}{80027}- It bought all your fuckin' flm stock.|- What about the record...
{80028}{80087}- Shh!|- What about the fuckin'|record company money?
{80088}{80136}I fuckin' lied.|Bucky's got his legs back.
{80138}{80188}Cheer up and chill out.
{80276}{80367}Anyway, time to get off the coaster.
{80369}{80446}Down to Austin,|recorded "Blue Tattoo. "
{80448}{80530}Got picked up by a big one.|Small, but English independent.
{80532}{80609}But I was still under contract|to the label, and they sued me.
{80611}{80697}The fuckers sued me,|and my record was recalled.
{80699}{80799}It sat around in vaults till|I didn't give a fuck anymore.
{80800}{80859}Last time I saw you at CBs,
{80860}{80916}I was hyping two bills a day.
{80918}{80997}Got so bad after you left,|I started into blood transfusions.
{81036}{81105}Everyone I met...
{81107}{81153}sucked up to me.
{81200}{81256}All my friends...
{81258}{81314}dead or dying.
{81350}{81423}Then I got the hepatitis,|came back home.
{81503}{81549}You know, Joe,
{81551}{81647}you start with these riffs|in your head...
{81648}{81703}and something you wanna say.
{81705}{81781}And you wanna spin gold,|but the thing is...
{81783}{81835}people don't want|your sounds.
{81837}{81884}They only want...
{81994}{82057}They just fucking use you.
{82059}{82105}Know what I'm saying, Joe?
{82201}{82253}Well.
{82255}{82314}Cheer up.|I made half that shit up.
{82316}{82392}- Who wants another drink?
{82584}{82661}- What's your name?|- Bruce.
{82663}{82713}- Do you want a drink?|- I'm all right, thanks.
{82715}{82766}I'm all right, thanks.|Look,
{82768}{82824}are you gonna sit around|in my kitchen being boring,
{82825}{82872}or are you gonna do|something interesting?
{82873}{82956}Are you a real flmmaker or are you|a journalist? Some kind of hack?
{82958}{83025}- No, it's not funny. Shut up.
{83064}{83111}I mean,
{83141}{83212}there must be something|interesting...
{83214}{83329}that fve really cool, able-bodied|guys and a great flmmaker...
{83331}{83400}can come up with.
{83401}{83448}What do you think, Brice?

{101729}{101812}- You have no sense of privacy.|- Reverend Pipeftter|is gonna do the sermon.
{101814}{101863}Listen to this.|Get off of my shoulder.
{101865}{101927}"J-J-Joe has informed me...
{101929}{102030}that m-my journal has been|deemed a threat to the band.
{102031}{102133}Well, fuck that. What the hell|has h-h-happened to us anyway?"
{102135}{102203}Anyway, listen to this.|'All week we went through these motions,
{102204}{102287}just holding our breath in case|someone whispers a secret...
{102289}{102336}too soft to hear.
{102338}{102395}Well, I held my breath|long enough.
{102396}{102469}I heard the secret|and I realized...
{102471}{102593}that I really came on this tour|because I can be honest with|these guys and nobody else."
{102595}{102657}There's more. Wait.
{102659}{102726}"I came back because when I'm at home,|I have to take these pills."
{102727}{102786}No shit. The guy's a looney.|Oh, here's a pill.
{102788}{102854}Would you fuck off.|"I have to lie to everyone.
{102855}{102933}I lie to Celine. I lie to myself.|I lie to everyone else.
{102935}{103030}I have to get up every day and tell|this lie every day about being normal.
{103032}{103123}And before the reunion came up,|I was scared I'd wake up one day...
{103125}{103176}and believe that lie|for the rest of my life.
{103178}{103261}Makes me wonder what lies|the other guys are believing. "
{103263}{103336}Is that hilarious or what?
{103368}{103431}You guys aren't laughing.|Oh, shit.
{103516}{103588}W-W-Well, this s-s-settles|one thing.

{104204}{104281}Would you give it a fucking break?|Give that camera a fucking break.
{104283}{104328}Why don't you guys|all fuck off.
{104330}{104432}jesus Christ. I mean, who do you|think you are anyway, Bruce?
{104434}{104484}Bruce, who do you|think you are?
{104486}{104604}I've seen your movies.|You seen his movies? What is it?|Roadkill and Highway 68.
{104640}{104690}Come on.|Give me a break.
{104692}{104767}I mean, hey, hey, look. Hey, man.|Look, I'm talkin' to you.
{104768}{104839}We've been through shit|and we've been through hell and back,
{104840}{104922}and we know what it's like,|and we still survived.
{104924}{104964}'Cause we're a fucking band, aren't we?|We're a fucking band, man.
{104964}{105016}'Cause we're a fucking band, aren't we?|We're a fucking band, man.
{105018}{105072}And you wanna know|something else?
{105074}{105144}I bet you we're gonna be here|a lot longer than you will.
{105146}{105279}And I bet you any money|your videos are probably|on sale at Payless for 99 cents.
{105281}{105327}There you go, blow.
{105328}{105397}Can we get some eggs here?|This beer is so fuckin' fiat.
{105399}{105471}- It's from last night.|I opened it last night.|-  It's urine.
{105583}{105641}You pissed in my beer?
{105848}{105902}There you go.
{105935}{105997}john's... book.
{106096}{106152}Words come and go,
{106244}{106303}but pictures never die.
{106465}{106531}You know, it's like when|you spend so much time with it,
{106532}{106583}it's like it is family, so...
{106584}{106638}Like that's...
{106640}{106718}H.C.L.F.,|the Hard Core Logo family.
{106720}{106812}We laugh our fucking heads off, or|there's just a lot of fucking tension.
{106814}{106905}And that seems to work.|And that's what real life is.
{106907}{107000}It's like a marriage. You get along,|and fghts are a drag, but they happen.
{107001}{107048}It's like|your brother or your sister.
{107049}{107121}You like them. You love them.|But you never tell 'em that.
{107123}{107212}You just give 'em shit|for the rest of their life.|Always pick out their bad points.
{107214}{107272}- That's all they do.|- I marry the music.
{107274}{107399}I marry the percussion|and the electrical sound,
{107400}{107482}so I'm kind of like|the mother of the band.
{107484}{107547}Certain things that fall|into place at different times...
{107549}{107654}where, you know, maybe it was John|taking care of everybody for a while...
{107656}{107712}or maybe it was Pipe.
{107753}{107811}Sometimes it's Joe, and then|it all sort of switches around.
{107812}{107872}Someone's always falling down|and other people are pickin' 'em up.
{107874}{107936}- We helped him out.|He's doing a lot better.|- The band's a family.
{107938}{107999}The guy's getting so much press,|he's going to fucking L.A.
{108001}{108046}In a way.
{108083}{108145}Fix the bridge|and it'll be perfect.
{108188}{108254}So, is it true|you guys faked the benefiit?
{108256}{108322}- What are you talking about?|- A friend of mine|just called from Vancouver.
{108324}{108385}Said Bucky Haight|was never shot.
{108387}{108473}- He's saying a lot of people|are really pissed off.|-  Like who?
{108475}{108536}We just saw Bucky.|He's in a wheelchair.
{108538}{108601}Well, I'm just saying|I heard he's not.
{108603}{108655}The guy showed us his stump, Victoria.
{108656}{108726}You ever see a guy's stump?|The guy's like,
{108728}{108799}"Come on, man. I want|to show you how it feels.
{108800}{108864}Touch it.|Touch my stump."
{108899}{108954}Disgusting!
{108956}{109024}So don't tell me|that Bucky Haight wasn't shot.
{109026}{109101}'Cause we were there.|We touched his stump.
{109103}{109151}Okay?
{109185}{109257}- Okay.|- Okay, now beat it.
{109341}{109416}Oh!|That was very clever.

You ever get the feeling that everything in America... is completely fucked up?
You know that feeling?
The whole country is one inch away from saying...
"That's it! Forget it!"
Think about it.
Everything's polluted-- the environment, the government, the schools--you name it.
Speaking of schools...
I was walking the hallowed halls the other day... and I asked myself...
"Is there life after high school...
"because I can't face tomorrow...
"let alone a whole year of this shit."
Yeah, you got it, folks.
It's me again with a little attitude... for all you out here in white-bread land... all you nice people... livin' in the middle of America the beautiful.
Let's see, we're on 92 FM... and it feels like a nice, clean little band so far.
No one else is using it and the price is right.
And, yes, folks, you guessed it.
Tonight, I'm as horny as a ten-peckered owl... so stay tuned because this is Hard Harry... reminding you to eat your cereal with a fork... and do your homework in the dark.
Hey! Gimme that.
Hey, man, let me see that.
Give it on over here.
He played Ice-T on this tape.
Great. Plays Ice-T and talks about his dick.
Nah, man.
Ice-T shreds on this.
I heard it last night.
Mr. Chavez? Luis Chavez?
Yes, just for a second.
All right, so I'll    pick you up after yearbook?
OK, Dad.
And no big dates tonight.
Be well-rested for your history exam tomorrow.
-OK.
-Yo, Paige!
Any time, anywhere, beautiful.
Mr. Paige.
Miss Paige Woodward arriveth.
So rich, so smart...
So perfect.
Cheryl, good to see you.
Gonna see the principal this morning, huh?
Mr. Murdock, can you tell me what this is about?
We'll see.
Excuse me, Mrs. Creswood.
Check this out.
What is it?
It's this guy.
He's got a pirate radio station on the air.
His name is
"Happy Harry Hard-on."
He's a total sex maniac.
Of course.
He comes on every night at 10:00.
Down to business.
I got my Wild Cherry
Diet Pepsi... and I got my Blackjack gum here.
And I got that feeling.
Yeah, that familiar feeling... that something rank is going down out there.
Yeah, I can smell it.
I can almost taste it-- the rankness in the air.
It's everywhere.
It's running through that old pipeline out there... trickling along that dumb concrete river... and coming up through the drains... of those lovely tract homes we all live in.
So who is he?
He goes to Humphrey.
I mean, I don't know.
Everywhere I look, it seems everything is sold-out.
They say this is where the reception is the coolest.
Then he probably lives right around here.
Fuckin' yuppies.
My dad sold out... and my mom sold out years ago when she had me.
And then they sold me out... when they brought me to this hole in the world.
Hey, they made me everything I am today... so, naturally,
I hate the bastards.
Speaking of which...
I'm running a contest... on the best way to put them out of their miseries.
Tonight, we have number twelve... of one hundred things to do with your body... when you're all alone.
Now, are you ready for the incredible sound... of Hard Harry coming on his own face?
Oh, my God.
It's very possible, you know?
Are you listening to this?
Yeah, of course I'm listening.
Guy's gotta have hair coming out of his palms.
This is a champion one.
Oh. There. Yeah.
Are you listening?
-Yeah, I'm going blind.
-He's doing it.
So unreal.
Oh, my God.
This...
Yes, Hard Harry will go to any length to keep... his three listeners glued with ooey blooey to the radios.
But the question is, how far will you go?
I mean, how far can you go... to amaze and disgust the insatiable Hard Harry, huh?
I mean, how serious are you?
Hi, beautiful.
You know what I can't figure out?
How you manage to get such great grades... and you listen to that radio all night, you know?
Tomorrow, don't forget--
Yale interview.
And I don't want you to look too sleepy, you know?
Good night, sweetie.
Got a lot of letters here, guys.
Here. "Dear Hard Harry...
"my boyfriend won't talk to me anymore.
"How do I show him that I really love him?"
Look, I don't know anything... about these letters asking for love advice. lf I knew anything about love...
I would be out there making it... instead of sitting in here talking to you guys.
No. Just send me stuff at Box 2710...
U.S.A. Mail, Paradise Hills,
Arizona, 84012.
Reply is guaranteed.
"Dear Harry...
"I think you're boring and obnoxious...
"and have a high opinion of yourself."
Of course, some of you are probably thinking...
I sent this from myself.
"I think school is OK if you just look at it right.
"I mean, I like your music...
"but I really just don't see why...
"you can't be cheerful for one second."
I'll tell you, since you asked.
I just arrived in this stupid suburb.
I have no friends... no money... no car... no license.
And even if I did have a license... all I could do is drive out to some stupid mall.
Maybe if I'm lucky... play some fuckin' video games, smoke a joint, and get stupid.
You see, there's nothing to do anymore.
Everything decent's been done.
All the great themes have been used up... turned into theme parks.
So I don't really find it exactly cheerful... to be living in the middle of a totally exhausted decade... where's there's nothing to look forward to... and no one to look up to.
That was deep.
Oh, no. Not again.
The creature stirs.
Oh, God, I think it's gonna be a gusher.
This is the sixth time in an hour.
Oh, God.
He sounds like a chronic masturbator.
He prides himself on it.
See? I have to take care of it.
Or else I'm going to explode.
Just excuse me while l...
Oh, my God, this is the biggest.
Whoa, Nellie! Whoa!
God! I'm gonna explode!
Oh, take cover, Arizona!
Here l--
Any time now, man.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, it's the best.
Oh, God, yeah.
Free at last.
I'm beat. I'm whipped.
Quittin' time.
Gotta recuperate.
There he goes.
Sometimes he's on for five minutes... sometimes he's on for five hours.
That's my man.
God, I feel so out of touch here.
Honey, we didn't move out here to stay in touch.
Then why did we move out here?
Because it's a nice place to live.
I'm making good money... and I'm the youngest school commissioner... in the history of Arizona.
Brian, you know what?
The man I married loved his work, not power and money.
That's all right.
I still love my work.
And I love power and money.
When you were young radical Brian... you were always fighting against the system... and now you are the system.
Now I am the system, yeah.
Is that a beer?
Sure.
Have you noticed his behavior lately?
What about him?
He's just so unhappy here.
I'll go talk to him.
What's up?
I was just looking for some stamps.
Oh, fine. I got some right here.
Going to send a letter to one of your friends back east?
No. I thought I might send away for an inflatable date.
You know, one of these days... you're gonna outsmart yourself, young man.
I love it when you call me "young man."
You know, when I was your age...
I was on all the teams and a bunch of clubs.
Look, all I'm saying is... that school must have some really terrific programs.
It's very highly rated.
Just save it for the masses, OK?
Mark, they've got twelve hundred students at that school.
Certainly, some of them got to be cool.
Look, the deal is,
I get decent grades... you guys leave me alone, right?
OK, who is this guy?
I don't know.
Nobody knows who he is, but he really hates this school... so I guess he goes here.
Yeah, but all the guys that go here are geeks.
Maybe not, my dear.
Later.
Later.
"And so then the Logicars questioned...
"the few remaining Despars more and more.
"They began to fade away...
"until there was nothing left of them...
"and they disappeared from the face of the Earth."
Pretty good, huh?
Leading with your heart, not your mind.
Mark, I wondered if you'd tell us... what you were thinking about when you wrote this.
I just wrote it late last night.
That's obvious.
It's practically illegible.
I was hoping that you'd share your feelings about it.
Saved by the bell.
Don't think if I didn't read your composition... it won't be read.
They're looking for new writers at the Clarion.
Don't be embarrassed of your talent.
-Hey, Paige.
-Hiya, Paige.
Hey, I finally got my new Miata.
You should hear the cd player.
It's unbelievable.
Tennis team's throwing a party tonight.
Later, Paige.
See you there.
See ya.
Hey, that's my box.
How's about asking, huh?
Good morning, Mr. Murdock.
Good morning, sir.
I'm not stupid, you know.
School is judged on one category only.
Academic schools.
The lesson of modern education is... nothing good comes easily-- no pain, no gain.
Excuse me, everyone.
Miss Creswood, you want to listen to this?
It's the third tape this week.
I can't believe it.
Oh, Nellie!
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna explode.
Oh, take cover, Arizona!
Here I come!
Jan, this is no laughing matter.
Enjoy.
You're in my writing class, right?
Right.
Yeah, I like Emerson.
She's pretty funky.
Now you're in trouble.
You owe twenty-five cents.
"How to Talk Dirty and lnfluence People"... by Lenny Bruce.
Who's he?
Any good?
He's all right.
Talk a lot?
Not too much, no.
Cute, but no way.
Guess who?
It's 10:00. Do you care where your parents are?
Because after all, it is a jungle out there.
I don't know.
I mean, everywhere I look... it seems like someone's getting butt-surfed by the system.
My parents are always talking about the system... and the Sixties and how cool it was.
Well, look at where the Sixties got them, huh?
Come on, people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Tune in, turn it up!
Now that was the Sixties.
This is a song for the Nineties... from my buddies The Descendants!
Welcome to Der Wienerschnitzel. may I take your order, please?
Yeah. I want...
Want whale sperm with that?
Why don't we listen to that one again, huh?
Welcome to Der Wienerschnitzel.
May I take your order, please?
Yeah. I want...
You want whale sperm with that?
I hate the Sixties,
I hate school...
I hate principals.
I hate vice principals... but my true, pure, refined hatred... is reserved for guidance counselors.
Happy Harry just happens to have in his very hands... a copy of a memo written by one Mr. David Deaver... guidance counselor extraordinaire... to one Miss Loretta Creswood, high school principal.
"I find Cheryl unremorseful...
"about her unfortunate condition."
Bastard can't even say she's knocked up.
What channel?
"And she's unwilling to minimize its effect...
"on the morale of the student population."
Guidance counselors. lf they knew anything about career moves... would they have ended up as guidance counselors?
What do you say we call Deaver up, huh?
Hard Harry just happens to have... the home phone numbers of every employee... of the Paradise Hills school commission.
Here we go.
There you are, Mr. Deavski.
Deaver residence.
David Deaver speaking.
Hey, this is WKPS.
You're live.
We're doing a piece on high schools.
We understand that you're a guidance counselor.
I'm head of guidance... here at Hubert Humphrey High in Paradise Hills, Arizona. l've been here seven years.
Could you tell us a bit about what you do?
I run a comprehensive
American values program. ln which we discuss... ethical situations... sex education, drug awareness...
What do you say to young people who look around at the world... and see that it's become, you know, like, a... a sleazy country, you know?
A place you just can't trust.
Like your school, for example.
How come it wins all of these awards... and yet students are dropping out like flies?
Why is that?
Now, my listeners are curious about your participation... in the decision to expel Cheryl Biggs. l--l...
I'm not aware of anything like that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, that's not true, sir.
"Cheryl refuses to accept suggestions...
"of a more positive mental attitude...
"towards her health and her future.
"I find no alternative but to suggest suspension."
Who is this?
How did you get this number?
Do you admit it, sir?
Admit what?
That you're slime.
Now, wait just a minute.
You interview a student, and then you rat on her.
You betrayed her trust. lsn't that right, sir?
Well, as you can see, these guys are played out.
Society is mutating so rapidly... that anyone over the age of twenty really has no idea.
All right.
Back down to business.
"I share a room with my older brother.
"Nearly every night after he turns off his light...
"he comes over to my bed...
"and gives me a few arm noogies and stuff.
"And then he makes me scratch his back...
"and other refinements."
Well, it's about time we had some refinements on this show.
"Then sooner or later, he gets worked up...
"and without further ado...
"he rubs his thing and makes me watch."
Signed yourself "Screwed Up."
Well, first of all, you're not screwed up.
You're an unscrewed-up reaction to a screwed-up situation.
Feeling screwed up in a screwed-up place... in a screwed-up time does not mean that you are screwed up. lf you catch my drift.
Now, as you know, dear listeners... if you enclose your number... a reply is guaranteed.
This is Happy Harry Hard-on.
You're live.
Is this Miss Screwed Up?
I have a couple of questions.
How big is this thing you described?
Is it bigger than a baby's arm?
You don't remember or you don't want to tell me?
Or maybe you made this whole thing up, huh?
Remember, my dear...
I can smell a lie like a fart in a car. it's too bad about that one, actually.
You see, to me... the real truth is always a bigger turn-on... and it doesn't have to be a big deal. lt could be anything.
Malcolm, have you finished your homework yet?
Your father and l are downstairs watching TV.
Why don't you come down and join us for once?
All right, Malcolm.
Have it your way.
Thanks.
So, I don't know.
Send me your most pathetic moment, your most anything.
As long as its real.
I want the size, the shape, the feel, the smell.
I mean I want blood, sweat, and tears on these letters.
I want brains and ectocasm and come spilled all over 'em !
Hallelujah!
And now, all my horny listeners... get one hand free, because...
Yes, the "eat me, beat me" lady is back.
"Come in.
"Every night, you enter me like a criminal.
"You break into my brain...
"but you're no ordinary criminal.
"You put your feet up and you pop a Pepsi...
"you start to party, you turn up my stereo...
"songs l've never heard, but I move anyway.
"You get me crazy. I say do it.
"I don't care what. Just do it.
"Jam me, jack me, push me, pull me, talk hard."
I like that.
Talk hard.
I like the idea that a voice can just go somewhere... uninvited... just kind of hang out... like a dirty thought in a nice, clean mind.
Maybe a thought is like a virus, you know? lt can kill all the healthy thoughts... and just take over.
That would be serious.
That would be totally serious.
Yeah. I know that all of my horny listeners... would love it if I would call up the "eat me, beat me" lady... but no!
Because she never encloses her number.
Tough luck, creepoid.
Always the same red paper... the same beautiful black writing.
Now, she's probably a lot like me-- a legend in her own mind.
But you know what?
I bet in real life, she's probably not that wild.
I bet she's kind of shy... like so many of us, briskly walking the halls... pretending to be late for some class... pretending to be distracted.
Hey, poetry lady, are you really this cool?
Are you out there?
Are you listening?
I'm always out here.
I feel like I know you, and yet we'll never meet.
So be it.
Here's a song from my close personal buddies back east--
The Beastie Boys.
This is a song that was so controversial... they couldn't put it on their first album.
Add a little night light.
Well
Chillin' at the corner this one time
Cool at the party, you're runnin' a line
Smokin' my crack, sayin' my rhyme
Countin' my pack just to pass the time
Many young girls do some base
Her boyfriend Pete, he was on my case
Took him to the place
Threw the mattress in his face
Got homeboy in his fuckin' face
I just love being the rap king of Arizona.
I don't know.
Drugs are out. Sex is out.
Politics are out.
Everything is on hold.
We definitely need something new.
I just keep waiting for some new voice... to come out of somewhere and just say, "Hey!"
"Wait a second. What is wrong with this picture?
"Just take a look around."
Maybe this is the answer to everything.
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?
"Dear Hard Harry...
"do you think
I should kill myself?"
Great.
Signed "I'm Serious."
And, of course, there is a number here.
Now, look...
Hello. Serious?
Are you OK?
I guess what I'm asking is, how serious are you?
Or how you gonna do it?
I'm gonna blow my fuckin' head off.
Well, do you have a gun?
No, I'm gonna use my finger, genius.
All right, so, where's this gonna take place, huh?
Right here.
Where is this alleged gun?
Do you have it with you?
Did you at least write a note?
You have a reason, don't you?
You're not gonna be one of those people... who kills themselves, and nobody has any idea... why they did it, huh?
That's why we need a note, pal.
I'm all alone.
Hey, look, maybe it's OK to be alone sometimes.
I mean, I...
Everybody's alone.
You're not.
I didn't talk to one person today... not counting teachers.
I sit alone every day, you know?
Sit in the stairwell, eating my lunch, reading a book.
What about you?
I hate that.
Now I'm depressed.
Now I feel like killing myself... but luckily,
I'm too depressed to bother.
Great. He's got the phone off the hook now.
Rejected again.
That's OK, I'm used to it.
Terminal loneliness.
People always think they know who a person is... but they're always wrong.
Eats lunch on stairs.
Parents have no idea.
Mine had me tested because I sit... alone in my room all day, naked, wearing only a cock ring. lt really bugs me.
Everyone thinks they know how a person should be.
Who cares how I should be, you know? ln real life, I could be that anonymous nerd... sitting across from you in chem lab... staring at you so hard, and...
Then when you turn around, he tries to smile... but the smile just comes out all wrong.
You just think, "How pathetic."
Then he just looks away.
He never looks back at you again.
Ah, hey.
Who cares? That's my motto.
Well, sleep tight, Cheryl.
Sleep tight, Miss Refinements.
Sleep tight, poetry lady.
Sleep tight, Mr. Serious.
Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow.
Hey, what's a cock ring? lt sounds cool.
How should I know?
Maybe it's a ring with a cock on it.
But he said he was wearing it.
How much you want for it?
Five bucks each.
Like your school, for example.
How come it wins all of these awards... and yet students are dropping out like flies?
Why is that, Mr. Deaver?
My listeners are wondering about your participation...
What is this?
I don't know, sir.
Is that your tape?
Whose tape is this?
I don't know, sir.
I looked around, and someone had slipped that on.
You know, people, this dancing is a privilege... and it'll be taken away if it's abused.
You understand that?
What? What are you lookin' at?
You got a stick of gum?
"Blackjack."
You really as horny as a ten-peckered owl?
Hi. My name's Nora.
What's yours?
Mark.
Well, hi, Mark.
Listen, I was gonna cut fourth period.
You want to join me for a smoke in the art supply room?
No, I can't. I gotta go. Sorry.
Sorry.
Boy, these damn tapes keep popping up all over the place.
They were playing this out in the alcove.
Who is this guy, anyway?
Every day there's more graffiti.
I don't know, but he's sure turning the school upside-down.
Has anyone seen Luis Chavez?
He wasn't in my class today.
Mine, either.
Listen to this.
...a memo, written by one Mr. David Deaver... guidance counselor extraordinaire... to one Miss Loretta Creswood, high school principal.
"I find Cheryl..."
Turn that off.
I have an announcement to make.
I have some very upsetting news.
Last night... one of our students...
Malcolm Kaiser... took his own life.
For those of you who knew him... there will be a memorial service at Dempsey Hall on Friday.
I know it hurts.
It's painful to lose someone.
Six, seven, eight
We've got spirit
Yes, we do
We've got spirit
How 'bout you?
We've got spirit
Yes, we do
We've got spirit
How 'bout you?
You're the voice crying out in the wilderness.
You're the voice that makes my brain burn... and my guts go gooey.
Yeah, you gut me.
My insides spill on your altar and tell the future.
My steaming, gleaming guts spell out your nature.
I know you-- not your name, but your game.
I know the true you.
Come to me, or I'll come to you.
So, you are him.
Don't worry. I'm not going to bust you or anything.
Aren't you going to ask who I am?
No, I don't think so. No.
I'm the "eat me, beat me" lady.
You don't believe me?
I know you-- not your name, but your game.
I know the true you.
Come to me, or I'll come to you.
Hey, relax. I'm not really like that except when I am.
Look, I really can't handle this right now, OK?
It's not your fault.
I was listening last night.
I didn't think he'd go through with it.
We heard about Malcolm Kaiser.
We're just wondering if you knew him.
No, not really.
I'm going to ask you something.
Your mother and l have been talking... and I guess we realized that--
Mark, basically, we thought... that you might benefit from seeing a psychiatrist.
Is it that obvious?
No, honey, of course not.
We think you're perfect. lt just seems that here you're so sad and lonely all the time.
And we want you to feel good about yourself.
You have friends in New York, hon.
Are you trying to meet people here at all? lt was never--
I know this sounds stupid... but have you ever just walked up to a girl here and said hi?
Look, the girls here, they're different.
I can't talk to them.
How are they different?
I was talking to your English teacher today--
Come on, Dad, please.
It's creepy enough there without you snooping around.
She says that you've got a great promise as a writer... but that you're having trouble concentrating.
So, when is Johnny going to concentrate, huh?
Get happy, get a girlfriend... and then write a best seller, huh?
Fine! You don't listen.
You don't talk to me.
You hate everything.
I can't talk to you people.
I'm certainly not going to a shrink.
Everybody's got problems, not just you... but you won't solve them if you don't communicate!
You've got to talk to somebody!
OK, he's gone.
He's gone back downstairs.
And so, family and friends of Malcolm Kaiser... sadly come and go into the night... even as phantom DJ Hard Harry... prepares to broadcast anonymously from somewhere... in this formerly peaceful community.
Shep Sheppard reporting live from Paradise Hills, Arizona.
Back to you, Bill.
Thank you, Shep, for that--
Yeah, back to you. lf it be your will
That I speak no more
And my voice be still
As it was before
I will speak no more
I shall abide
Until
I am spoken for lf it be your will
You see,
I never planned it like this.
My dumb dad got me this shortwave radio set... so I could just speak to my friends back east.
But I couldn't reach anybody... so I just thought
I was talking to nobody.
But I imagine nobody listening.
Maybe I imagine that one person out there.
Anyway, one day I woke up... and I realized I was never going to be normal... so I said, "Fuck it."
I said, "So be it..." and Happy Harry Hard-on was born.
But I never meant to hurt anyone.
Honestly...
I never meant to hurt anyone.
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
I never said... don't do it.
I'm sorry.
Anyway...that's it.
The show's over.
I'm done.
Stick a fork in me.
It's been grand.
This is Hard Harry saying sayonara.
Over and out.
Come on, you can't do this.
This is a joke, right?
Come on, Harry, baby, don't stiff.
What am I doing?
Fuck it.
You hear about some kid, did something stupid-- something desperate.
What possessed him?
How could he do such a terrible thing?
Well, come here.
It's really quite simple, actually.
Consider the life of a teenager, huh?
You have parents and teachers telling you what to do.
You have movies, magazines, and TV telling you what to do... but you know what you have to do.
Your job, your purpose... is to get accepted, get a cute girlfriend... think up something great to do for the rest of your life.
What if you're confused and can't imagine a career?
What if you're funny-looking and can't get a girlfriend?
You see, no one wants to hear it.
But the terrible secret... is that being young... is sometimes less fun than being dead.
This is great.
He's making it worse.
Suicide is wrong, but the interesting thing about it... is how uncomplicated it seems.
You know?
There you are, you got all these problems... swarming around in your brain, and here is one simple-- one incredibly simple solution.
I'm just surprised it doesn't happen every day around here.
Now, they're going to say I said offing yourself was simple... but no, no, no, it's not simple.
Like everything else, you have to read the fine print.
For instance, assuming that there is a Heaven... who would ever want to go there?
You know?
I mean, think about it.
It's cool. You're sitting there up on this cloud.
It's nice, you know, it's quiet.
There's no teachers... there's no parents, but guess what?
There's nothing to do.
It's fucking boring.
Another thing to remember about suicide... is that it is not a pretty picture.
First of all, you shit your shorts.
You know?
So, there you are, dead.
People are weeping over you, crying.
Girls you never spoke to are saying, "Why? Why? Why?"
And you have a load in your shorts.
That's the way I see it.
Sue me.
Now, they're saying I shouldn't think stuff like this.
They're saying that something is wrong with me... that I should be ashamed.
Well...
I'm sick of being ashamed.
I mean, aren't you?
Sick to death.
I don't mind being dejected and rejected... but I'm not going to be ashamed about it.
Hallelujah.
At least pain is real.
You look around, and you see nothing is real... but at least pain is real.
Even this show isn't real.
This isn't me.
I'm using a voice disguiser.
I'm a phony fuck just like my dad.
Just like anybody.
The real me is just as worried as the rest of you.
They say I'm disturbed.
Of course I'm disturbed!
We're all disturbed, and if we're not, why not?
Doesn't this blend of blindness and blandness... want to make you do something crazy?
Then why not do something crazy? lt makes a hell of a lot more sense... than blowing your fucking brains out!
Go nuts! Go crazy!
Get creative!
You got problems?
You just chuck 'em.
Nuke 'em !
They think you're moody?
Make them think you're crazy.
Make them think you might snap!
They think you've got attitude?
You show them some real attitude.
I mean, go nuts!
Get crazy!
No more Mr. Nice Guy!
Oh, God!
God! Yeah!
Happy Harry Hard-on!
Time out.
This is good.
This is very, very interesting.
Hi, it's me.
You're on the air.
Are you willing to tell my listeners... what you told me here in this letter?
I think they're ready to handle it.
I'm not ashamed.
So, tell us what happened.
This guy I knew, he invited me up to the ridge... and, well,
I wasn't really sure why... but I was really happy, because he's pretty cool.
He's an athlete and everything.
First of all, when was this, and how old are you?
Just before school.
I'm sixteen.
Go ahead.
So, we get up there, we take off our shirts... and we start fooling around.
And then, I sort of told him how much I liked him.
He just smiled and said he knew it.
Then he says...
"Why don't we take our pants off and get a tan?"
So I did it.
But he stalled.
Go ahead.
And then two of his friends showed up... and they were drinking beer and laughing.
And they took my clothes and threw them up in the trees.
I didn't know what to do.
I started to cry, but... they just laughed at me, so I stopped.
Then they started calling me things... but I don't even care about that.
I know I'm into guys, but... this was different.
So, what did you do?
Everything.
Everything they told me.
I'm calling the police.
Fraud, pornography-- he is just using those poor kids.
That's the thirteenth call tonight.
Sounds like kids bullshitting to me.
I don't know.
Things like that happen when you're a kid.
You swallow it, Donny?
I think you're forgetting what it's like when you're young.
Come on, Shep.
He got some kid to call in with some story they've concocted. lt isn't real.
Who cares if it's real if the people are riveted?
Let's go.
No. People are rebroadcasting this thing over state lines.
I think it's time to bring in the feds.
This is FCC jurisdiction.
I feel bad that
I didn't even do anything.
I didn't even say anything.
Now he won't even talk to me.
He won't even look at me.
I'm pretty confused.
Confused?
You're not the one who's confused.
You sound like you know exactly what's going on. lf anyone's confused, it's those guys out there.
I know, but I think about him a lot.
Sometimes I wonder why one person is born one way... and another person is born another way.
Are you there?
So, I guess you think
I'm a faggot wimp, right?
I'm just thinking how strong people can be... and how everyone is alike in some way... and how everyone needs the same things.
So, what are we going to do about all this?
I don't know.
That's the big question, isn't it, huh?
I guess nobody knows, huh?
Well, that's tough. I got to go.
See you.
I guess we all got to go now.
Good night, pal.
Good night, friends.
"Believe it or not, I care"?
"Eight-thirty to three-thirty."
What's that?
It's some new hotline
Deaver's setting up.
Hey, it's eight-thirty in the morning... so I guess it's OK to kill myself.
Oh, my God, it's after three-thirty... so I guess I'm totally fucked.
What are you doing?
Tramp.
Bitch.
How's he getting this information?
I want all the locks in the school changed.
I want a list of every student with relatives on the staff.
Just found the graffiti on the roof of the cafeteria.
They're taking it down now.
What's it say?
"Creswood's a maggot pus wad."
Hey, are you the guy selling tapes of that guy?
-Yeah.
-How much?
Five bucks each.
All right, let me have it.
-There you go.
-Thanks, man.
Selling pretzels, Donald?
Nobody knows who he is.
We don't believe you, Donald.
I swear to God.
Nobody has any idea.
Then you've got until the end of the day to get an idea.
And don't forget-- your file is under review.
You better bring all your enrollment files to my office.
What did they do to you?
-You Donald?
-Yeah.
I'm Joey.
Can you get me into the P.A.?
Stay hard!
All right! Yeah!
The truth is a virus!
That's it for music in the alcove.
And from now on... anyone caught defacing school property is expelled.
David Deaver speaking
Who is this
Who--who--who is this
You just hold on a minute there
David Deaver speaking
David Deaver speaking
What's happening?
What's going on?
It's Mr. Deaver.
David Deaver speaking
Admit what lt won't stop.
Turn the speaker system.
Shut off the whole system.
We can't!
Shut down the whole school.
You just--you just
-All right, Randy.
-Check this out.
You're the TV guy, right?
Want to interview me?
Because I was listening the first night it was on... and I'm amazing.
Here. Plug it in.
I used to go here, you know?
But they kicked me out for no reason.
Know what I'm saying?
Check it out.
School colors, you know?
It's instant pep rally.
The smog's getting worse and worse in this town.
Go down on him.
Come here, you little--
Mr. Murdock.
Can you direct me to the office?
Come on!
This is Shep Sheppard reporting live... from deep in the smoke at Hubert Humphrey High.
Sit down.
Anybody mind if I smoke?
You do understand you're expelled.
That's cool.
I can quite legally expel you.
Loretta, I'm already expelled.
Don't you remember?
You booted me out the first week for dress code.
You're trespassing.
How'd you like to be arrested?
That's cool, too, you know?
Because I told them cameras to wait.
I got lots to tell them.
Who's going to believe anything you say?
Who's going to believe you?
Maybe Harry might.
What are you doing?
It's cool.
We're safe in here.
Guess what I heard?
What?
That smug Paige Woodward... she burned up all her shit last night... right after you suggested it. ln her kitchen!
Her precious pearls were flying like bullets.
Her dad was unthrilled.
What?
This is out of control.
Yes!
Students are requested to inform their parents... of an emergency meeting tonight... with the PTA and the school commissioner.
That's it.
It's over.
I just hope it isn't too late.
Just leave me alone, OK?
Please.
Oh, yes.
D-D-David Deaver
And I really, really don't give a damn
I really don't know anything
Because I haven't got it
Have you guys listened to the Hard Harry show?
We would never, ever listen to trash like that.
He's obscene, dude.
Yo, Mom.
Yo, I'm D-D-David Deaver
Is that box registered to a name?
Yes, of course that box is registered to a name... but I can't give it out to you.
But you can to me.
Yes, sir, I can do it for you.
I will give it to you instantly.
That box is rented to Mr. Charles U. Farley...
One-one-two-two Crescent.
But that's the address of the school.
Chuck U. Farley. ln a follow up to Monday's tragic suicide... we have a story on Paige Woodward... who was a senior at the same high school... who, apparently at the urging of the pirate DJ... set off an explosion in her family's home.
Are you OK, Mark?
Don't worry. I'm not gonna blow up the kitchen.
Very funny, darling.
Listen to this.
...still anonymous radio operator.
He's been charged with criminal solicitation... in the suicide death of Malcolm Kaiser.
Elsewhere--
Mark, have you ever listened to this character?
No, not exactly listened.
He's knocking the best school in the district... and apparently, he goes there.
Well, it's not exactly the best school in the district.
There are some problems with it.
I figure you don't rock the boat... especially if you're sitting in it.
We should get going.
I don't want to be late.
Come on, Mark.
It's your father's big meeting.
Good evening.
On behalf of myself... and the staff of Hubert Humphrey High...
I would like to thank you for turning out in such numbers.
I congratulate you on your concerns.
Now, before we begin...
I would like to introduce our new school commissioner... fresh from several educational triumphs... on the East Coast--
Brian Hunter.
Before I introduce the rest of our speakers--
Excuse me, Mrs. Creswood.
Can we just skip the preliminaries... and find out what you're doing about all this?
Well, when I introduce Mr. Deaver... he'll talk about our new 24-hour hotline--
Wait a minute. The kids who need the most help... the ones with drug problems... they don't go in for stuff like that.
I know kids.
They just want to be happy.
Would you please sit down?
This radio person is the whole problem.
Are we gonna allow this guy to be heard... by anyone who can turn a dial?
Please, one at a time.
I work with teenage gangs in the city.
I say we go after this guy.
Remove him physically.
Same old rhetoric!
What are you doing--
Please! We can't have this kind of meeting.
This is not the way--
You'll all be heard.
I promise.
Brian, this is my meeting.
That's the girl who blew up her kitchen last night.
My name is Paige Woodward... and I have something to say to you people.
People are saying Harry is introducing bad things... and encouraging bad things. lt seems to me these things were already here.
Please go and sit.
My God, why don't you people listen?
He's trying to tell you there's something wrong... with this school.
Paige--
Half the people here are on probation of some kind.
We're all really scared to be who we really are.
I am not perfect. l've just been going through the motions of being perfect... and inside, I am screaming!
Paige, you were a model student.
Why won't you listen?
Let's hear what she has to say!
Paige, I want to hear what you have to say.
Do you know who he is?
Are you prepared to do anything he says?
Can you hear me?
Don't listen to them !
Don't listen to any of them !
Stay on!
Has this affected your school work?
Stand hard!
What do your parents think about this?
Are you on drugs?
Talk hard!
I got a lot of homework.
I'm gonna take off, all right?
I know why you're really going home.
'Cause you want to listen to that show tonight, don't you?
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Those your letters?
You having fun?
Here. I took some of these off the wall for you.
I mistakenly thought you might want them.
Thanks.
So I guess you're not going on tonight.
Brilliant.
Is this all just a game to you?
You can't just shout "fire" in a theater and walk out.
You have a responsibility to the people who believe in you.
What is this?
Come on, say something.
Say anything!
Open your mouth and say...
"Get the hell out of here, bitch."
I can't.
You can't what?
I can't talk.
Sure you can talk.
I can't talk to you!
I got a letter from this guy who has a problem.
He can't talk.
I mean, he can talk, but never when he wants to-- not to girls, not to people.
What did they say, around FM 92?
I can't believe it's as bad as they say.
He just opened up his mouth, and nothing came out.
Then this jerk finds somebody that he likes... which is probably the worst thing that can happen... to a person that can't talk.
I don't know what to tell this guy... because lately, every time I give advice... the fit hits the shan.
So...
I don't know. Maybe the... best thing to do is just... turn around... face the music... and try to talk.
Fuck.
Damn it. Coming!
It's just us.
We want to come in for a minute.
Just give me a second here!
Two seconds!
Mark, unlock the door.
Mark, can you hear us?
We want to come in for a minute.
Open the goddamn door!
On my way!
Your mother and I have been out there for five minutes.
What the hell are you doing in here?
I was just reading.
Oh, come on, Mark.
We heard you.
We heard you talking, all right?
Yeah. I was reading aloud.
Oh, come on. You really expect us to believe that?
OK, I'll tell you the truth.
He was talking to me.
Hi. I'm Nora Diniro.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
I was afraid you'd be mad
I interrupted Mark's homework.
Oh, no. Not at all.
You don't know how happy we are to meet you.
Yeah. Really.
Well, listen, I gotta go... but it was really nice to have met you.
Bye, Mark.
You don't have to go.
It's all right.
Mark, she doesn't have to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You've been a bad dog, haven't you?
You know, for a second there... we actually thought you were that crazy DJ character.
Maybe he's not that crazy, Dad.
Right. Very funny.
Go get her. Come on.
That's my idea of homework.
Sorry about that, folks.
Technical difficulties.
Happens all the time in professional radio.
Who do we have out there tonight?
The usual band of teenage malcontents?
I certainly hope so...
'cause Hard Harry's feeling kind of rude tonight.
And she's so pretty, too.
She sure is.
That little lech.
Well, like father, like son.
I feel good!
Damn!
Well, well, the big news.
Emergency PTA meeting to discuss yours truly!
Yes, all of the professionals have come out... to talk about little old me... and now they've all run home to tune in... and listen to what they've all been talking about.
They say I am deluded... demented...deranged!
Well, guess what I say!
So be it!
Rise up in the cafeteria... and stab them with your plastic forks!
I say flogging and flagellation for Miss Creswood!
She gets a hundred lashes for every single kid... that she has hounded out of that fucking place!
I say down with all guidance counselors!
Make them work for a living!
I can't stay away from this man!
I gotta give him another call!
Here I come, Deav.
Hotline.
Believe it or not, we care.
Hi, Believe lt or Not, this is Hard Harry... and I would like the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Deaver.
Just a moment.
I'll see if he's available.
I love it.
They just put me on hold.
I'm waiting for you.
You can run, but you cannot hide, Mr. Deaver.
Waitin' for the Deav.
Hello, my young friend.
You're in on it, right, Mr. Deaver?
It's all over, son.
This phone call has been traced... and whoever you are, you're history.
Well...
So be it.
Hallelujah.
Shit.
Don't just sit there, man. Run!
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right.
See, I'll bet what's happening out there... is that the police are busting some poor little old couple... unknowingly supplying me with my phone feed.
There's a phone line coming into the shed here.
There's the transmitter... which means the receiver could be in any house... within a thousand yards of here.
I am everywhere.
I am inside each and every single one of you.
Just look in, and I will be there... waving out at you... naked... wearing only a cock ring.
Time flies when you're on the run.
I'm gonna cut out now with this unusual song...
I'm dedicating to... an unusual person... who makes me feel kind of... unusual.
So many people
Come walking by
Looking so happy
When all I do is cry
I just wanna be
With somebody, too
What l'd give for a kiss
What am I gonna do
Why can't I fall in love
It's OK.
You don't have to talk.
You don't have to say anything... and you don't have to do anything... unless you want to.
You're so different.
I meant... you're so fearless.
I wish I could be like you.
You are.
I wish...
I could say things to you.
You do.
Everything's so strange.
Maybe we're just crazy.
So be it.
And change where I'm at
But the same old questions
Keep flowing back
Why can't I fall in love
I know she's out there waiting
It's time to fall in love
And I know
Just how I feel
Give it up or give it all
Something tells me
This can be real
It's the cops.
It's OK. I think they're just dropping off my neighbor.
So... are you really wearing a cock ring? l've never even seen one.
I read about 'em in a magazine.
Maybe I don't believe you.
What are you doing?
I have neighbors.
Stop!
So you can talk when you want to.
Yes, I can.
I know she's out there waiting
It's time, it's time
Why can't I fall in love
Maybe we should pause for station identification.
I gotta go.
Why can't I fall in love again
I know she's out there waiting
It's three days since the death of Malcolm Kaiser... and state and local officials still have little idea... of the identity of this so-called Hard Harry... although many are convinced he is a student at this school.
You OK?
You?
This is deep.
Your message is out there.
"The truth is a virus."
Oh, God.
Jesus, this whole thing is making me ill.
Mark, what is with you?
Look, Nora, last night was a mistake.
I'm not going on anymore.
It's over.
-But you're so close.
-Close to what?
To getting your message out.
This is my life you're screwing around with here.
Not anymore, it isn't.
This is everyone's life.
You can't leave it like this.
People are confused.
Well, so am l.
The thing's fucked up!
It's crazy!
No. The world is fucked up, just like you said.
Don't you see that you're the voice?
You're the voice you were waiting for.
You're completely nuts.
Yeah, well, you make me nuts.
Excuse me.
Young lady, would you come along with us?
Donald, come along.
Miss Diniro.
Come along with us, please.
What are we being busted for?
We check your files, we'll see.
Come along.
No, Brian, everything is under control. l've just ordered psychiatric evaluations... on a couple of the key troublemakers, and l--
I can do whatever I like.
It's my school, Commissioner.
No, you're not coming over here. lt would only upset me more.
Good-bye.
Well... shall we have a look at these files?
Or shall we discuss the identity of our DJ friend?
No more Mr. Nice Guy!
Oh, God!
Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!
Don't push me, people.
You understand that?
They got forced to take me back.
Where you going?
Yo, I'm putting this up.
Get off the campus.
Put it on my desk.
You're not supposed to be here.
What's the matter, Murdock?
You're getting so tense.
You're not supposed to be here.
I'm a big fan of yours.
Can I get an autograph?
Stop! That's enough!
What's wrong with you?
He was beating up students.
-What's wrong with this school?
-Control yourself.
I will not!
I want an answer!
Or suffer the consequences.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your dismissal. l've been looking all over for you.
I just wanted to apologize for saying that you were nuts.
Forget it.
Look...
FCC. You know what that means?
Yeah, it means Federal
Communications Commission.
They can drive around and triangulate... wherever the hell the radio signal's coming from.
Yes, I know exactly what it means.
So fuck it, right?
I mean it's over.
Frankly, I don't even give a shit anymore.
What the hell's wrong?
I just got expelled.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm failing math.
They can't kick you out for that. l've been cutting classes, and I'm way over the limit.
They didn't tell me till now.
So that just deserves a suspension, right?
Well, then I said "fuck you" to Creswood.
You should have seen her face.
She was so happy, she said thank you.
This school sucks!
Jesus Christ.
I don't even care--
No, just leave it alone!
There's nothing you can do about it.
Hunter, wait a minute!
I just wanted to say good-bye... and good luck.
Why?
I was fired. I made a mistake.
I thought I could change things.
I forgot you don't rock the boat.
Especially when you're in it.
Come on, chin up.
Loretta, what in the hell's happening here?
It's the troublemakers.
You can't run a top school with troublemakers in the mix.
OK, so what exactly is a troublemaker?
Someone who has no interest in education.
Come on, that includes every teenager I know.
Can't you understand... that nothing is more important than a good education?
Except the basic right to it.
The point is...
I have the highest average
S.A.T. scores in the state.
Yeah, but how?
I stand by my record.
There he is. Mr. Watts.
Shep Sheppard,
Channel Six news here.
Good evening.
How does Washington intend to deal with this situation?
We at the FCC feel that democracy is all about... protecting the rights of the ordinary citizen.
Unregulated radio would result in programming... of the lowest common denominator... the rule of the mob.
This is vandalism, not free expression.
Hey, NBC's here, and if he goes on... they're gonna rebroadcast him nationally.
There's no way he can go on.
It's too risky.
Oh, God, come on.
OK, everybody, ten seconds till Happy Harry Hard-on.
Eight, seven... six, five, four... three, two, one.
Come on. We're right here waiting for you right now.
You OK?
Yeah, fine, great.
Never been better.
We started something here.
We?
All right, I started it, but... now I need your help to finish it.
Nora, I need you.
Well, it's about time.
I've got something to show you.
Is it bigger than a baby's arm?
No. It's outside.
It's my mom's Jeep.
She kind of loaned it to me.
Who did all this?
Me and Radio Shack.
You have driven a Jeep before, right?
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
That's the way the story goes
Got him.
You know, personally,
I had hoped that we'd get... to hear him a little bit before they nab him.
Be interesting to see how hard he is then.
Hi, Dad, happy birthday
I'm in jail
Jail
Hello, Dad
I'm in jail
Hello, Dad
I'm in jail
Hi, Dad
I'm calling you from jail
Hi, Dad
Happy birthday
I'm in jail
Jail, jail
Hello, Dad.
We're going to jail.
Say hi to Mom !
I like it here
It's nice, I like it
Hi, folks. Seems we have a new listener tonight--
Mr. Watts of the FCC.
My favorite person and yours, too, I know.
Hi, Arthur, thanks for coming out.
Well, thank you for coming out.
Imagine, a fucking political hack... being in charge of free speech in America.
I'll bet Watts was the guy who took names in high school... when the teacher was absent.
This is the problem with free speech.
Would you cut that thing, please?
He's the kind of phony in politics who wears a wig.
Would you just turn the damn thing off?
Christ.
He's obviously moving.
Just pull over everything on wheels.
Welcome to Radio Free America.
America's ready, I'm ready.
I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.
Jesus, let's get serious.
Hello. Hello, anyone.
This is Arthur Watts.
I am under siege.
Maybe Mr. Watts can shed some light... on the mysterious disappearances of some of our students.
Luis Chavez, age fifteen... legally kicked out on September 26.
Arthur Washington, age sixteen, expelled on September 27.
Hector Garcia...
So what does this prove?
Not everyone goes to college.
Right.
I think you should be aware of something.
After the school received the money from the government... for every enrolled student...
Mrs. Creswood would then proceed... to weed out those she felt were undesirable.
Nonsense. She doesn't know what she's talking about. ln the first week of school... you flagged all the names with low S.A.T. scores... and started files on them. Why?
What are you doing with school property?
She asked you why.
For extra tutoring?
You expelled over twenty students... in the first thirty days of school.
And how many others did you harass into dropping out?
And you kept the expelled students' names on the rolls.
That's illegal.
The money went to the school.
It's all for the good of the school.
Those kids had rights.
They were losers.
-Troublemakers.
-They're just kids.
I don't regret my policy.
It's criminal, and I'm suspending you.
You can't do that.
I think I just did.
Please get some help.
Just drive over them.
Oh, jeez, my harmonizer.
Forget it.
Hold on.
I gotta get us out of here.
I needed that to disguise my voice.
Give me a minute.
Maybe we can fix it.
Jesus.
Look at this.
Fuck it.
I'm going on without that thing.
No. I think I've got it.
OK.
This is really me now.
No more hiding.
Listen.
We're all worried.
We're all in pain.
That just comes with having eyes, with having ears.
But just remember one thing. lt can't get any worse. lt can only get better.
I mean, high school is the bottom.
Being a teenager sucks, but that's the point.
Surviving it is the whole point.
Quitting is not going to make you strong.
Living will, so just hang on and hang in there.
I know all about the hating and the sneering.
I'm a member of the
"Why bother?" generation myself.
But why did I bother to come out here tonight?
And why did you?
I mean, it's time. lt begins with us-- not with politicians... the experts, or the teachers, but with us-- with you and with me-- the ones who need it most.
I believe with everything that's in me... that the whole world is longing for a healing.
Even the trees... and the Earth itself are crying out for it.
You can hear it everywhere.
It's the same kind of healing
I desperately needed, and... finally feel has begun... with you.
Everyone listen up!
It's not over yet.
This is just the beginning... but it's up to you.
I'm calling for every kid to seize the air.
Steal it. lt belongs to you.
Speak out.
They can't stop you.
Find your voice and use it.
Keep this thing going.
Pick a name.
Go on the air.
It's your life.
Take charge of it. Do it.
Try it, try anything.
Spill your guts out.
Say shit and fuck a million times... if you want to, but you decide.
Fill the air.
Steal it.
Keep the air alive!
We're behind you all the way,
Harry.
You talked to me, man.
You really talked to me.
You're the one, man.
We believe in you, Harry.
Stay tough, man.
You did great.
Forget it, man.
We believe in you, Harry.
We're with you, man.
We're with you all the way.
Talk hard!
Hi, everybody, this is Amy at 97 FM in Springfield... and my show is Radioactive.
Can anyone out there hear me?
This is Ethan from L.A., and I'm here...
Are you running in the streets?
Call the real runaway hotline...
K.C.A.T.,
Los Gatos, California...
This is "I am, are you?"
Hi, you're on the air...
Turn on the truth.
