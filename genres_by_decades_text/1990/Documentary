WE WERE ON A TV SHOW ONCE,
AND WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE A BIG ENTRANCE
THROUGH SOME SLIDING DOORS.
AND THEY HAD A HUGE STAGEHAND
BACK THERE WHO WAS GONNA OPEN
THE DOORS FOR US.
THEY GOT US IN POSITION.
SOMEBODY SAID, "BREAK A LEG,"
YOU KNOW, AND WALKED AWAY.
THIS BIG STAGEHAND
TURNS TO US AND SAYS,
"SO YOU'RE THE GUYS
WHO KILLED BAMBI'S MOTHER."
AND WE SHRANK AWAY.
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU SELDOM
HEARD FRANK'S NAME...
WITHOUT OLLIE'S ALONG WITH IT,
OR OLLIE'S WITHOUT FRANK'S NAME.
IT WAS "FRANK AND OLLIE."
THEY REALLY PIONEERED
THIS TYPE OF ANIMATION.
THEY BROUGHT PERSONALITY
ANIMATION BEYOND, UH,
EVEN WHERE WALT
THOUGHT IT COULD GO.
OH!
SHE COULDN'T BE!
OH!
SHE COULDN'T BE!
I'VE NEVER GONE
ANY PLACE ON THIS EARTH...
THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW
AND COULD TALK ABOUT,
SPECIFICALLY,
SCENES THAT
FRANK AND OLLIE DID.
HOW'S THAT FOR TOUCHING,
I MEAN, BILLIONS OF PEOPLE?
WHAT ARE THERE,
4h BILLION ON THE PLANET?
I'D GUESS THAT HALF OF 'EM
KNOW SOME SCENE THAT FRANK
OR OLLIE DID.
HEY.
GOOD MORNING.
OH, HI.
BOY, YOU SURE GOT
A LOT OF TRASH.
YEAH, A LOT
OF OLD MANUSCRIPTS
THEY DIDN'T LIKE.
HUH. MUST'VE HAD
A BIG PARTY.
NO.
YEAH.
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THIS WEEK.
WE FIRST MET AT STANFORD.
WE WERE IN THE ART DEPARTMENT,
AS I RECALL.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF
AN ART DEPARTMENT THERE REALLY.
THE REASON WAS THAT
MRS. STANFORD WALKED IN
ON A CLASS BACK IN 1900,
AND THERE WAS A NUDE MODEL,
AND SHE SAID, "AH!
NEVER BE ANOTHER NUDE MODEL
OR A DRAPED MODEL
HERE AT STANFORD."
SO, UH, WE HAD TO GO
ON UP THE PENINSULA.
UP TO, UH, WHERE?
SAN MATEO?
SAN MATEO.
YEAH.
- IN ORDER TO GET...
- TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.
OUR LIFE DRAWING CLASS IN.
THEN WE'D GET CREDIT
BACK DOWN AT STANFORD FOR IT.
AND ON THE WAY BACK,
WHY, I'D TALK FRANK
INTO PLAYING THE PIANO...
AT THIS LITTLE SPEAKEASY
UP ON THE HILL
ABOVE THE HIGHWAY.
SO WE'D GO IN THERE, AND
THEY'D GIVE US FREE DRINKS
FOR HIM PLAYING THE PIANO.
YEAH, BUT WE ALSO HAD TO LEAVE
ONE OF THE PAINTINGS
WE'D MADE THAT DAY...
IN THE LANDSCAPE
PAINTING CLASS.
OUR VAN GOGHS
OR OUR CEZANNES.
WE FELT LIKE
WE WERE RIGHT IN...
WHATEVER WE HAPPENED TO BE.
WITH THOSE TOP PAINTERS
OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW?
SO WE'D GO OUT AND MAKE
A PAINTING, COME BACK IN
AND TRADE IT FOR DINNER.
WE WERE ARTISTS.
AFTER COLLEGE,
WE CAME DOWN TO LOS ANGELES...
TO GO TO ART SCHOOL,
AND WE MOVED INTO
A BOARDINGHOUSE.
YEAH, WHERE THIS
RETIRED UNDERTAKER LIVED.
HIS WIFE WAS SO MAD
THAT SHE NOW HAD TO RUN
THIS BOARDINGHOUSE...
THAT SHE WOULDN'T
EVEN SPEAK TO HIM.
AND THEIR SON PRACTICED
HAVING FUNERALS...
OUT IN THE BACKYARD
UNDER YOUR WINDOW.
YEAH. HE CALLED 'EM
"GRASS FUNERALS."
I'D ALWAYS LIKED CARTOONS,
BUT I NEVER FOUND ANY THAT
I REALLY LAUGHED TOO HARD AT.
THEN ONE NIGHT I WENT
TO SEE THIS THING...
WHERE THE DOG GOT CAUGHT
IN THE FLYPAPER.
AND IT WAS
JUST HILARIOUS TO ME.
I ROLLED ON THE FLOOR,
AND SO DID EVERYBODY
WHO WAS WITH ME.
AT THE TIME
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS SO FUNNY.
I JUST KNEW THAT THERE
WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT THIS PICTURE...
AND SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT
THIS DOG THAT I'D NEVER SEEN
HAPPEN ON THE SCREEN BEFORE.
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE
THAT ANYBODY...
COULD MAKE A DOG
LOOK LIKE HE WAS THINKING.
THE WAY HE'D TRY TO FIGURE OUT,
AND HIS EYEBROWS WOULD GO DOWN
AND UP.
IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
I'D NEVER THOUGHT OF GOING
INTO THE ANIMATION BUSINESS...
BECAUSE ANIMATION
WAS NOT CONSIDERED A PROFESSION.
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT...
NEWSPAPER CARTOONISTS
DID SOMEHOW.
NOBODY WAS VERY INTERESTED
IN IT, AND THERE WEREN'T
ANY STUDIOS TO GO TO.
♪ YOU'RE NOTHIN'
BUT A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ A NOTHIN'
A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ YOU'RE NOTHIN'
BUT A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ A NOTHIN'
A NOTHIN' ♪
THEN IN THE SPRING
OF 1934,
I SAW THIS NEW MOVIE
FROM THE DISNEY STUDIOS
CALLED THE FLYING MOUSE,
AND IT WAS
A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION TO ME...
BECAUSE IT HAD THE FEELINGS,
THE EMOTIONS OF THE CHARACTERS,
AND, UH, MORE PATHOS
IN THE STORY,
AND, UH, IT REALLY GRABBED YA.
♪ YOU'RE NOTHIN'
BUT A NOTHIN' ♪
♪ A NOTHIN'
A NOTHIN' ♪ ♪
WELL, I THOUGHT,
"GEE, THIS FLYING MOUSE,
"IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO
THAT DIRECTION,
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE
THAT WOULD INTEREST ME."
THE IDEA OF BRINGING
A CHARACTER TO LIFE
REALLY BEGAN TO FASCINATE ME.
SO I TOOK THE TRYOUT
AT DISNEY'S AND GOT HIRED.
17 DOLLARS A WEEK.
BUT THIS WAS
THE DEPRESSION, '34.
UH, WEREN'T MANY JOBS AROUND.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THE ONLY JOBS THAT I HEARD OF...
WERE WITH DISNEY'S
OR WITH THE W.P.A.
I'VE ALWAYS USED
AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.
FOR SOME REASON I SEEM TO GET
MY BEST IDEAS WHILE I'M SHAVING.
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE ELECTRICAL
CURRENT'S SO CLOSE TO MY BRAIN.
NAH.
I REMEMBER ONE MORNING
I WAS LYING IN BED
IN OUR BOARDINGHOUSE.
FRANK WAS SHAVING,
AND I WAS WAITING 'TIL
HE FINISHED WITH THE RAZOR.
WE BOTH USED
THE SAME ONE.
AND HE TURNS AROUND
AND HE SAYS,
"OH, BY THE WAY, THEY WANT YOU
TO TAKE A TRYOUT AT DISNEY'S."
AND I THOUGHT, "GEE WHIZ!
"HERE I'M GOING TO ART SCHOOL,
AND MY DAD JUST PAID
MY TUITION.
"OH, WELL, I'LL TRY IT.
"I'LL GO OUT THERE AND SEE
IF I CAN'T MAKE SOME MONEY...
AND PAY MY OWN WAY
AND GO BACK TO ART SCHOOL."
SO I WENT OUT
AND TOOK THE TRYOUT.
SOMEHOW I MADE IT.
AFTER I'D BEEN THERE,
OH, SAY ANOTHER TWO WEEKS
AFTER THAT,
I FOUND OUT
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
I WOULD EVER WANT TO BE.
THERE WERE FOUR ANIMATORS
THAT STOOD OUT ABOVE
ALL THE REST OF THEM...
AT THE TIME WE CAME.
THERE WAS NORM FERGUSON,
WHO WE CALLED FERGY.
THERE WAS HAM LUSKE,
AND THERE WAS FREDDY MOORE
AND BILL TYTLA.
FERGY HAD A WAY
OF DRAWING THINGS...
SO THAT YOU SAW THE OUTSIDE OF
WHAT THE CHARACTER WAS DOING...
STAGING THE ACTION.
HAM DREW A WAY THAT
REVEALED WHAT THE CHARACTER
WAS THINKING ABOUT,
WHAT HE WAS FEELING.
HELLO, JUDGIE.
I'M JENNY WREN.
I WANNA SEE JUSTICE DONE.
THEN THERE WAS BILL TYTLA,
WHO HAD THIS TREMENDOUS
INNER FEELING.
HE WAS ABLE TO GET INSIDE
OF EVERYTHING HE DID.
YOU COULD JUST FEEL THIS AS YOU
OPENED THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM.
YOU'D FEEL, "WHOOPS,
I DON'T BELONG IN HERE.
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
THAT'S VERY POWERFUL."
BUT FREDDY, UH,
HE WAS REAL HAPPY.
WE WAS BALANCED UP
ON HIS CHAIR HERE,
AND HE HAD TO BE
WELL-BALANCED, LIKE A DIVER,
BEFORE HE COULD DRAW.
THEN HE'D PULL DOWN
THE PIECES OF PAPER AND...
♪ ♪ PULL DOWN ANOTHER,
AND VERY FAST.
AND HE HAD THIS TREMENDOUS
APPEAL IN HIS DRAWINGS.
HE COULDN'T MAKE A DRAWING
THAT DIDN'T HAVE EVERYTHING
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
IT MIGHT NOT BE DOING
THE RIGHT THING,
BUT ALL HIS DRAWINGS
ALWAYS HAD THE ARM...
SO ONE ARM RELATED
TO ANOTHER, SO THE HEAD
RELATED TO THE SHOULDER.
EVERYTHING WAS IN
THE RIGHT PLACE.
WELL, HUH, SO LONG.
I'LL BE SEEIN' YA...
I HOPE.
MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF WALT
WAS THAT HE WASN'T A BIG SHOT.
HE WAS JUST WALKING
AROUND THE HALL LIKE
ANY OF THE FELLOWS.
AND, UH, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I HAD EXPECTED,
BUT, UH, I LOOKED ON HIM
MORE AS A TEACHER...
BECAUSE, REMEMBER,
I WANTED TO WORK ON CHARACTERS
THAT HAD PERSONALITY...
WHO YOU COULD BRING TO LIFE
IN SITUATIONS THAT CALLED FOR
EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS,
AND HE WAS THE MAN WHO WAS
LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING.
SO THAT MADE
A REAL NICE RELATIONSHIP.
AND THE GUY WAS INTO
EVERY PHASE OF THE THING.
HE WOULD CRITICIZE
THE DRAWINGS.
HE WOULD CRITICIZE
THE ACTING.
HE'D CRITICIZE THE SIZES OF
THE DRAWINGS, THE PERSPECTIVE.
AND HE HAD
THIS WONDERFUL KNACK OF KNOWING
WHAT WAS UNIVERSAL IN APPEAL,
WHAT WAS UNIVERSAL
IN THE UNDERSTANDING...
AND WHAT PEOPLE
WOULD LAUGH AT.
AND HE'D GET YOU
ROLLING ON THE FLOOR
YOU'D BE LAUGHING SO HARD.
I SOON REALIZED, "HERE'S THE GUY
THAT MAKES THIS STUDIO GO."
AND, OF COURSE,
I'D HEARD ABOUT HIM FOR YEARS,
BUT NEVER REALIZED THAT
HE WAS THAT IMPORTANT.
RALPH WRIGHT HAD NEVER BEEN
IN A MEETING WITH WALT BEFORE,
AND HE WAS APPREHENSIVE
ABOUT IT.
HE HAD THESE DRAWINGS
OF PLUTO WAKING UP
IN THE MORNING,
AND HE WAS CONCERNED
WHETHER WALT WOULD
LIKE IT OR NOT.
AND HE WAS TRYING
TO TELL THE STORY,
AND HE LOOKED AT WALT...
AND WALT WASN'T PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO HIM.
WALT WAS DOING
ALL THIS STUFF
LIKE FRANK'S DOING.
AND, "GOD,"
RALPH THOUGHT.
"MY GOD, I'M WORKING
FOR A SPASTIC.
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?
HE'S NOT PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO MY STUFF."
AND HERE HE WAS
ACTING OUT WHAT HE SAW
IN RALPH'S DRAWINGS.
HE SAID,
"COULDN'T WE HAVE...
"YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN YOU
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, YOU GOT
THIS BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH?
COULDN'T WE
HAVE PLUTO DO A LITTLE MORE
OF THAT TYPE OF THING?"
RALPH THOUGHT HE WAS LIKE
ONE OF THESE BRITISH KINGS
THEY NEVER TALKED ABOUT.
I'M A KIND OF A SENTIMENTAL GUY,
I GUESS.
THE WAY I'VE SAVED THIS PENCIL
THAT FRED MOORE...
DREW MICKEYS AND
SNOW WHITE DWARVES WITH...
AND LAMPWICK AND PINOCCHIO.
UM, I KEEP IT TAPED UP
TO MY WINDOW...
TO REMIND ME OF HOW GREAT
THE GUY WAS...
AND HOW MUCH HE MEANT TO ME.
MORE BEAUTIFUL STUFF
CAME OUT OF THIS PENCIL.
IT JUST FLOWED OUT LIKE...
LIKE LIQUID.
BEAUTIFUL DRAWINGS
OF THE DWARVES...
WHERE HE'D DRAW
THE CHEEKS ON THEM,
WHERE IT WAS A SLIGHTLY
WIDER LINE AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE CHEEK OR ON THE NOSE.
ANYWAY, THERE WAS A LOT
OF TALENT IN THIS PENCIL,
AND I JUST DISCOVERED
THERE'S STILL A LITTLE BIT
OF LEAD LEFT IN IT.
I MAY SAVE THAT
FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL.
WELL, I'M MICKEY MOUSE.
YA KNOW?
MICKEY MOUSE?
I HOPE YOU'VE HEARD OF ME.
I HOPE.
WELL, I'M, UH, MICKEY MOUSE.
YA KNOW? MICKEY MOUSE?
I HOPE YOU'VE HEARD OF ME.
I HOPE.
WHEN I STARTED
AT THE STUDIO, UH,
I'D HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT
THE IMPORTANCE OF PATHOS...
IN, UH, COMEDY,
AND TALK ABOUT CHAPLIN.
HE ALWAYS HAD
THIS PATHOS IN THERE.
AND, UH, I'D SAY, "PATHOS?
WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY THAT?"
PATHOS IS SOMETHING
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL DOWN...
OR IT MAKES YOU CRY
MAYBE EVEN, YOU FEEL
SO STRONGLY ABOUT IT.
I COULD NEVER SEE THAT
THAT WAS PART OF COMEDY.
TO ME, COMEDY WAS,
"HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR."
WHAM! BANG!
YOU KNOW,
ALL THIS SLAPSTICK STUFF.
BUT GRADUALLY, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHO AFFECTED ME,
WHETHER IT WAS OLLIE
OR WHETHER IT WAS WALT...
OR THE OTHER FELLOWS,
THE OTHER ANIMATORS
AT THE STUDIO,
BUT GRADUALLY
THIS GREW ON ME.
WHAT GREATER GAG COULD YOU
EVER HAVE THAN THAT ONE
IN CITY LIGHTS...
WHERE HE'S SITTING THERE
CLOSE TO THE BLIND GIRL,
AND SHE'S WASHING OUT THE CAN
THAT SHE'S HAD THE FLOWERS IN...
AND SHE THROWS IT OUT AND
HITS HIM RIGHT IN THE FACE!
AND TOOK HIM A LONG TIME
TO COME UP WITH THIS,
BUT IF YOU WERE NOT FEELING
SORRY FOR HIM...
AND SORRY FOR HER
FOR BEING BLIND,
THE PATHOS IN THAT WHOLE MEETING
THERE WAS SO STRONG...
THAT THIS GAG JUST HITS YA.
AND IT'S STILL ONE OF THE
CLASSIC, GREATEST THINGS THAT'S
EVER BEEN DONE ON THE SCREEN.
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T STOP THIS.
MM. THAT FEELS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
MM-HMM.
WELL, JUST YESTERDAY MORNING...
HE WAS GETTING DRESSED
TO COME DOWN HERE,
TRYING TO PUT THIS BELT ON,
NOT WITH THE LOOP THROUGH
BUT THE LITTLE PIN...
AND HE COULDN'T DO IT,
AND HIS FACE GOT REDDER...
AND HE JUST GOT FURIOUS
AND THREW THE THING OFF.
AND I SAID, "HONEY, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK."
WELL, THEN HE LAUGHED
AT HIMSELF.
BUT HE GETS...
OH, IT WAS JUST TERRIBLE.
AND THEN HE LAUGHED,
GAVE ME A KISS AND
EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT.
BUT...
HE CAN GET...
NOT OFTEN, BUT...
SNOW WHITE
WAS A BIGGER DEPARTURE
THAN MOST PEOPLE REALIZE.
WHEN WALT STARTED IT,
HE THOUGHT THAT, UH, YOU
JUST MAKE THE PICTURE LONGER.
MAKE LIKE A BUNCH OF SHORTS
CONSTRUCTED TOGETHER,
SIX OR SEVEN OF THEM.
IT DIDN'T WORK THAT WAY.
HE'D NEVER MADE
A FEATURE PICTURE BEFORE.
HE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT THE PROBLEMS WOULD BE...
IN PUTTING THE THING TOGETHER,
MAKE IT WORK AS A STORY.
HE WROTE A LETTER TO A FELLOW
DURING THAT TIME AND SAID,
"I GOT STORY PROBLEMS
DRAPED AROUND MY NECK
LIKE A BUNCH OF SPAGHETTI."
THE SEVEN LITTLE DWARFS.
BUT LET WALT DISNEY
TELL YOU ABOUT THEM HIMSELF.
THE DWARFS' NAMES
FIT THEIR PERSONALITIES.
THIS POMPOUS-LOOKING INDIVIDUAL
IS DOC, THE SELF-APPOINTED
LEADER OF THE GROUP.
AND THIS LITTLE FELLOW
IS BASHFUL.
HE'S SECRETLY IN LOVE
WITH SNOW WHITE.
IT WAS CALLED
"DISNEY'S FOLLY"
AROUND TOWN.
NOBODY THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD GO OVER.
AND ACTUALLY, THEY DID
RUN OUT OF MONEY.
AND, UH, ROY SAYS, "WALT,
YOU GOTTA SHOW THIS PICTURE
TO THE BANK OF AMERICA...
SO THEY'LL BRING US IN
SOME MORE MONEY."
AND, UH, WALT SAID,
"NO, I CAN'T SHOW IT.
IT'S NOT IN SHAPE."
ROY SAID,
"YOU GOT TO."
SO THIS FELLOW CAME IN
AND LOOKED AT THE PICTURE.
DIDN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT IT.
AND AS HE LEFT
TO GO BACK TO HIS CAR,
WALT AND ROY CAME RUNNING ALONG
BEHIND HIM, YOU KNOW,
LIKE A COUPLE OF KIDS, AND SAID:
"WELL, WHAT'D YOU THINK?"
AND THE GUY SAID...
"AH," HE SAYS, "YOU CAN
HAVE ALL YOU WANT."
"FINISH IT UP."
"IT WAS GREAT.
FINISH IT UP."
I THINK THE FIRST DISNEY FILM
THAT I REMEMBER WAS SNOW WHITE.
AND, UH, I WAS IMPRESSED
BY THE ACTION SEQUENCES,
BUT I WAS ALSO...
I ALSO REMEMBER
THE POIGNANT SEQUENCES.
UH, THE SADNESS OF IT.
UH, THE DWARFS AROUND
SNOW WHITE'S BIER,
AND, UH,
THAT THEY WERE CRYING.
UM, AS A CHILD, UH,
YOU KNOW, IT WAS, UH...
IT HAD A GREAT IMPACT
BECAUSE HERE WERE CHARACTERS...
THAT HAD MADE ME LAUGH AND
FEEL GOOD THROUGHOUT THE FILM,
AND NOW THEY WERE...
EXPERIENCING
AND EXPRESSING SORROW.
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T
REALIZE IT AT THE TIME...
THAT THIS WAS
AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH
IN PERSONALITY ANIMATION.
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF FILM,
MOVING DRAWINGS
HAD BECOME MOVING DRAWINGS.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING
ON THE PLANE?
I DON'T HAVE ROOM TO TAKE
WHAT I WANNA WEAR ON THE PLANE.
I'LL HAVE TO WEAR
SOMETHING ELSE.
MY SUITCASE
IS ALREADY FULL.
THEN THERE'S
NOTHING TO DO, HUH?
HOW MANY SHOES
SHALL I TAKE?
THREE.
THAT'S WHAT I GOT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HERE'S ONE.
WORD WITH "MISS" OR "BEER."
IS THIS "MYTH"
OR "MYTHS"?
M-I-S-S.
OH, YEAH, "MISS."
AND THE ANSWER
IS "NEAR."
"NEAR MISS"
AND "NEAR BEER."
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NEAR.
AND I KNEW...
I'M A NEAR MISS.
I NEARLY GOT IT.
PUZZLES. GOSH.
OKAY. BETTER LUCK...
NEXT TIME.
YEAH.
I THINK FRANK, UH,
IS ONE OF THE LEAST...
UH, MERCURIAL ARTISTS
THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN.
HE'S A... HE'S A VERY
EVEN-TEMPERED MAN.
IT ISN'T THAT HE DOESN'T
FEEL THINGS DEEPLY,
BUT HE HAS THE, UH,
SUNNY DISPOSITION...
THAT SOMEHOW DOESN'T HAVE
THE FLIP SIDE OF BEING HIGH.
HE'S NOT EQUALLY LOW,
WHICH HAPPENS TO MOST OF US.
AND AS A RESULT, UH,
I'VE LIVED WITH SOMEONE
WITH THIS RELENTLESS CURIOSITY,
WHICH MAKES LIVING
LOTS OF FUN.
AND, UH... AND HE'S ALWAYS
PLEASANT TO BE AROUND,
WHICH IS MORE THAN
I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF.
NEVER MIND ALL THAT!
GET TO THE PART
WHERE I LOSE MY TEMPER!
...TEASING, TORMENTING
AND OTHERWISE ANNOYING
OUR BELOVED...
NEVER MIND ALL THAT!
GET TO THE PART
WHERE I LOSE MY TEMPER!
UH, FRANK AND OLLIE
ARE TWO OF THE GREATEST
CHARACTER ANIMATORS EVER...
BECAUSE THEY'RE
TWO OF THE GREATEST
SCREEN ACTORS EVER.
I MEAN, THEY HAVE SUCH A...
THEY'RE LIKE A REPERTORY COMPANY
WITHIN THEMSELVES.
UH, THEY'VE PLAYED
HEROES AND HEROINES,
VILLAINS AND BUFFOONS.
UH, THEY'VE EVEN PLAYED
INANIMATE OBJECTS.
I DON'T THINK LAURENCE OLIVIER
EVER PLAYED A DOORKNOB.
THE WORST THING ABOUT
STARTING A NEW SCENE...
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO START
WITH A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER,
AND THERE'S NOTHING ANYBODY ELSE
CAN DO TO HELP YOU.
YOU HAVE TO
START IT YOURSELF.
YOU CAN'T GO AND SAY,
"HEY, MAKE A DRAWING FOR ME
AND THEN I'LL WORK OVER THAT."
NO. IT'S THE REVERSE. YOU HAVE
TO MAKE THAT DRAWING FIRST.
IT'S NOT LIKE LIVE ACTION,
FOR INSTANCE,
WHERE YOU HAVE,
OH, ROBERT REDFORD AND
MERYL STREEP OR SOMETHING.
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT'S A KNOWN QUANTITY.
WE START WITH NOTHING.
THAT'S A PRETTY GIRL. OH.
SUCH PRETTY, SOFT HAIRS.
PRETTY HEAD.
YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST DOG
ON FLINTRIDGE AVENUE.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
YEAH.
YEAH.
SEE, YOU GOT
THIS LINE HERE, TEDDY.
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR A DOG.
IT'S A SMILE LINE,
LIKE PEOPLE HAVE.
YOU KNOW THIS LINE
THAT COMES DOWN HERE?
MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
THINKING AND GIVES YOU
GOOD EXPRESSIONS.
MOST DOGS DON'T HAVE THAT.
THAT MAKES YOU
A VERY SPECIAL TYPE DOG.
MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE INTELLIGENT.
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY
TOO TRUTHFUL A VIEW OF THINGS.
OLLIE AND I HAVE
A DIFFERENT APPROACH...
TO ACTUAL DRAWING...
ANIMATING.
HE IS VERY INTUITIVE
AND HAS TO FEEL FROM THE INSIDE.
HE HAD A SIGN UP ON HIS DESK
THAT SAID:
"WHAT IS THE CHARACTER
THINKING AND WHY DOES
HE FEEL THAT WAY?"
WHICH IS VERY PERCEPTIVE.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN
ANSWER THOSE TWO QUESTIONS,
YOU'RE WAY DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS
GETTING A SCENE OUT OF IT.
FRANK IS VERY ANALYTICAL.
HE FIGURES EVERYTHING OUT,
MAKES NOTES ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I FINALLY LEARNED
TO DO THAT A LITTLE MYSELF.
EVERYTHING. FIGURES IT
ALL OUT COMPLETELY.
HE WENT TO MORE TROUBLE
IN PLANNING A SCENE...
THAN ANYBODY
IN THE STUDIO EVER DID.
WHEN I LOOKED AT
OLLIE'S DRAWINGS,
OLLIE HAD THIS WAY
OF ALMOST KISSING THE PAPER
WITH HIS PENCIL.
IT WAS JUST,
JUST SOFTLY BRUSHING IT...
AND FINDING
THE SIMPLEST FORMS.
HIS THINKING
SEEMED TO ALWAYS BE...
IN ZEROING IN ON WHAT
IS THE SIMPLEST WAY...
OF MAKING A STATEMENT
IN THIS DRAWING.
HE DIDN'T SUBJECT SCENES
TO THE SAME, UH,
RIGOROUS ANALYSIS...
THAT FRANK
SUBJECTED IT TO.
HE ALWAYS HAD
A MUCH MORE GUT, ANIMAL WAY
OF DEALING WITH THINGS.
HE COULD TAKE A SCENE...
AND HE WOULD BE ABLE
TO FEEL IT STRONGLY
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
AND I SUSPECT
HIS FIRST REACTIONS TO IT
WERE ALWAYS ACCURATE.
FRANK'S WAY OF DRAWING,
TO ME,
ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE...
THERE WAS A THOUSAND LINES
TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT WAY
OF SAYING WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY.
AND HE WAS SEARCHING.
YOU COULD SEE IT
IN HIS DRAWING.
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
IT WAS AN INVISIBLE THING
HE WAS SCULPTING...
WITH THE EDGE OF THE TINY
LITTLE TIP OF HIS PENCIL.
A VERY THIN LINE,
NERVOUSLY SEARCHING...
AND FINDING OUT THAT FORM
AND THAT EXPRESSION.
ONCE YOU SEE THE FILM
OF YOUR DRAWINGS,
THEN YOU'RE HOOKED
ON ANIMATION.
NOTHING CAN TAKE THAT...
CAN GIVE YOU THE SAME FEELING.
SCULPTURE, PAINTING, UH,
DRAWING, ETCHINGS... ANYTHING.
NONE OF IT CAN GIVE YOU
THAT SAME FEELING OF LIFE...
THAT YOU GET OUT OF SEEING
THIS DOGGONE LITTLE CHARACTER...
WORKING AROUND
ON THE MOVIOLA...
OR ON THE PROJECTION...
PROJECTED UP ON THE SCREEN.
AND, UH, YOU FEEL LIKE...
A PARENT WHO HAS JUST SENT
HIS KID AWAY TO SCHOOL.
YOU DON'T REALLY OWN THIS GUY
UP ON THE SCREEN ANYMORE.
YOU DID FOR AWHILE. YOU WERE
VERY CLOSE TO HIM FOR AWHILE.
BUT NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HERE HE IS APPARENTLY MAKING
DECISIONS ON HIS OWN,
DOING QUITE WELL
WITHOUT YOU, THANK YOU.
I'LL TELL MY FATHER!
JIMINY! OH, JIMINY!
OH, JIMINY,
WHERE ARE YOU?
JIMINY CRICKET!
WE KNEW WE WERE DOING
A DIFFERENT KIND OF ANIMATION...
THAN HAD EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
SOME OF THE OLD-TIMERS
THAT WERE WORKING AT THE STUDIO
WOULD EVEN TELL US,
"YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS DOING IT,
IT WASN'T LIKE THIS.
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THESE STORIES LIKE THIS."
WE KNEW AFTER SNOW WHITE
THAT WE HAD SOMETHING...
THAT WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
THAN ANYBODY HAD EVER ATTEMPTED.
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL.
THEN I MET SOMEBODY.
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL.
THEN I MET SOMEBODY.
PINOCCHIO, WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO TO SCHOOL?
- SCHOOL? WELL, I, UM...
- GO AHEAD. TELL HER.
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL
'TIL I MET SOMEBODY.
MET SOMEBODY?
YEAH.
TWO BIG MONSTERS.
WITH BIG GREEN EYES.
THIS WAS ONE
OF THE FIRST CASES,
UH, ONE ON PINOCCHIO,
WHERE, UH, WE WERE
ACTUALLY ANIMATING...
RIGHT THROUGH A SEQUENCE.
'CAUSE WE BOTH HAD
LONG NOSES TO DRAW ON HIM.
WE HAD TO CHECK
WITH EACH OTHER.
YOU GOT THE SHORTER NOSES.
YOU GOT HIM PLAYING IT
LIKE A FIFE OR SOMETHING.
I HAD TO MAKE SURE
I HADN'T DRAWN IT TOO LONG
FOR THE NEXT SCENE.
I HAD THIS NOSE
THAT'S WAY OUT HERE,
AND EVERY PLACE
HE TURNED...
THE NOSE WAS GOING WAY BEYOND
ANYTHING YOU COULD DRAW.
AND WHERE WAS SIR JIMINY?
OH. JIMINY? UH...
HEY! PSST!
LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS!
THEY PUT HIM
IN A LITTLE SACK.
NO!
YES!
HOW DID YOU
ESCAPE?
I DIDN'T.
THEY CHOPPED ME
INTO FIREWOOD!
THERE WAS A FEELING THAT AS YOU
STARTED TO WORK ON A SCENE,
THAT YOU'D SORT OF
ENCASE YOUR...
YOU HAD A CONTACT WITH THE MAGIC
THAT WAS BEHIND THE DRAWING.
NOT THE DRAWING ITSELF AS MUCH,
BUT THIS WHOLE FEELING OF...
THIS IS A ROOM,
THIS IS A FOREST GLADE,
THIS IS A ROCK,
THIS IS A CASTLE...
WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YOU'RE DRAWING.
HERE'S YOUR CHARACTER IN IT,
AND YOU HAD TO BE ABLE TO SEE
YOUR CHARACTER...
WORKING IN THREE DIMENSIONS
GOING IN THERE...
AND LIVING IN THERE, AND YOU
WANTED TO LIVE IN THERE.
IF THE PHONE RANG, YOU...
IT WAS LIKE A REAL DREAM.
IT'S HARD TO COME OUT
OF THIS CONCEPT TO PICK UP
THE PHONE AND THINK,
"WHERE AM I?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TODAY?
HELLO? WHO'S THIS?"
AHEM. COME TO...
AHEM. COME TO THINK OF IT,
IF I WAS A PIRATE,
I-I-I WOULDN'T HIDE
ANYTHING BACK THERE.
AHEM.
C-COME TO THINK OF IT,
IF I WAS A PIRATE,
I WOU... I WOULDN'T HIDE
ANYTHING BACK THERE.
ANOTHER HISS OUT OF YOU...
UH, UH, UH, UH, HISS... AND YOU
ARE WALKI TO NOTTINGHAM.
ONE MORE...
ONE MORE HISS OUT OF YOU...
UH, UH, UH, UH, HISS...
AND YOU ARE WALKING
TO NOTTINGHAM.
YOU KNOW, MY BEST IDEAS
COME TO ME WHILE I'M WALKING.
SOMETIMES I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT. I'M TOO TIRED.
BUT ONCE I GET DOWN HERE
AND START WALKING,
WHY, THE JUICES START FLOWING
AND THEN I REALLY FEEL MUCH
BETTER AND I'M GLAD I DID IT.
AND I ALWAYS DID LIKE
TO DO ATHLETICS,
AND I USED TO GET ALL KINDS
OF CARICATURES.
EVERYTHING I DID,
SOMEBODY DREW A CARICATURE OF.
YOU COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY...
WITHOUT GETTING
A CARICATURE MADE OF IT.
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO BE
SERIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING
AND EXPRESS YOUR PHILOSOPHY,
GEE, THEY'D DRAW YOU
LIKE LINCOLN
OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.
YOU JUST NEVER KNEW
WHAT WAS GONNA COME OUT.
YOU MADE ONE COMMENT, AND YOU'D
GET 50 DRAWINGS COMING UNDER
YOUR DOOR OR ONTO YOUR DESK.
THEY'D SLIDE IN
UNDER THE DOOR.
I WAS LOSING MY HAIR
AT ONE POINT,
REALLY?
AND FRANK MADE A DRAWING OF ME
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS
MY HAIR WOULD COME BACK.
I WAS HAVING
HAIR TREATMENTS
OVER IN HOLLYWOOD.
THERE WERE A BUNCH
OF NICE-LOOKING GIRLS
GIVING THESE TREATMENTS.
EVERY TIME YOU'D COME IN,
THEY'D SAY, "OH! YOUR HAIR'S
REALLY COMING BACK GREAT."
LOOK AT THIS FUZZ.
BEAT YOU DO DEATH, SCRUBBING
YOUR HEAD OR SOMETHING.
WALT WASN'T BOTHERED
BY ALL THESE JOKES...
AND THINGS LIKE THAT...
WITH THE CARICATURES
THAT WENT ON...
BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT
IT WAS SHARPENING OUR SKILLS
OF COMMUNICATION.
NONE OF THESE GAGS
WOULD HAVE PAID OFF IF YOU
DIDN'T COMMUNICATE PROPERLY...
SO THAT THE GUYS KNEW WHAT YOU
WERE DOING, WHO THE JOKE WAS ON
AND WHAT THE JOKE WAS.
STRANGE COINCIDENCE
THAT I DIDN'T FIND OUT...
UNTIL, ACTUALLY, A DOZEN
YEARS AGO OR SO, I GUESS,
WAS THAT FRANK'S MOTHER...
WAS BORN IN
TUSCOLA, ILLINOIS,
THE SAME TOWN
THAT MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN.
LITTLE DINKY PLACE NOT FAR
FROM CHAMPAIGN-URBANA.
AND, UH, THAT WAS
AN UNBELIEVABLE COINCIDENCE
AMONG ALL THE OTHERS.
THAT WE BOTH HAD EDUCATORS
FOR FATHERS.
IT WAS REALLY... WEIRD.
WE BOTH LIKED
THE SAME KIND OF BOOKS.
WE GREW UP ON THE ROBIN HOOD,
IVANHOE, SCOTTISH CHIEFS.
ALL THOSE GREAT, ROMANTIC
HISTORICAL NOVELS.
I WAS ROBIN HOOD,
AND I FORMED A BAND
AROUND ME OF GUYS.
SOME OF THEM DIDN'T WANT
TO BE IN IT,
BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ELSE TO DO FOR THE SUMMER.
AND WE LIVED OUT ON THE EDGE
OF TOWN IN FRESNO,
AND THERE WEREN'T
ANY OTHER KIDS TO PLAY WITH,
SO I NEVER HAD THE ADVANTAGE
OF BEING ROBIN HOOD...
AND HAVING A WHOLE GANG
OF KIDS AROUND ME.
SAY, "YOU BE WILL SCARLETT AND
YOU BE LITTLE JOHN" AND SO ON.
SO I HAD TO DO ALL THAT
IN MY IMAGINATION.
UH, HE RODE A MOTORCYCLE
FOR AWHILE. I NEVER DID.
I RODE A BICYCLE.
I HAD A DOG. I DON'T REMEMBER
WHETHER HE HAD A DOG OR NOT.
HI, HONEY.
HI.
I'M ON MY WAY DOWN TO FRANK'S.
OKAY.
WILL YOU BE HOME
FOR LUNCH?
OF COURSE.
HI THERE, TEDDY.
YOU DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME.
HI. HI.
WHATCHA GOT?
WE HAD SOME SPECIAL PROBLEMS
WITH BAMBI.
WE'D HAD PROBLEMS
ALL THE WAY THROUGH...
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO
MAKE DEER INTERESTING ENOUGH...
THAT THEY COULD SUSTAIN
A WHOLE FEATURE.
AFTER BAMBI'S BIRTH
AT THE START OF THE THING,
BAMBI'S MOTHER TOOK HIM AROUND
TO INTRODUCE HIM TO ALL
THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
DULL, DULL, DULL.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID,
YOU COULDN'T PUT ANY LIFE
INTO THE THING.
WELL, ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE
TRYING TO GET VOICES
FOR ALL THE LITTLE BUNNIES,
"DID
THE YOUNG PRINCE FALL DOWN?"
AND THE ANIMATORS SAID,
"THERE'S OUR VOICE!"
AND THE CASTING DIRECTOR SAID,
"GET THAT KID OUTTA HERE.
HE CAN'T ACT."
BUT WE BROUGHT HIM BACK,
AND HE COULD ACT...
AND HAD
THIS WONDERFUL VOICE.
SO HE WAS THE ONE
WHO TOOK BAMBI AROUND,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WAS
A WHOLE DIFFERENT PICTURE.
IT WAS A PICTURE
ABOUT KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
GOOD MORNING, YOUNG PRINCE.
HELLO.
WHATCHA EATIN'?
CLOVER.
CLOVER.
IT'S AWFULLY GOOD.
IT'S DELICIOUS!
WHY DON'T YA
TRY SOME?
NO, NO!
NOT THAT GREEN STUFF.
JUST EAT THE BLOSSOMS.
THAT'S THE GOOD STUFF.
SEEMS LIKE THUMPER
WAS ALWAYS POPPING OFF,
TRYING TO TELL HIS IDEAS.
AND IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE
OF THE SECTION I DID...
WHERE THUMPER SAYS,
"EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT,"
HE HAD SAID TO BEGIN WITH,
TO BAMBI,
"DON'T EAT THAT GREEN STUFF.
JUST EAT THE BLOSSOMS."
- AND HIS MOTHER SAYS...
- "THUMPER, WHAT DID YOUR FATHER
TELL YOU THIS MORNING?"
WE NEVER SAW THE FATHER, BUT YOU
KNEW THAT HE'D SAY, "NOW, SON,
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER..."
SO WHEN OLLIE GOT
THE SCENE OF "EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT.
IT MAKES LONG,
BIG FEET, BIG EARS"...
UH, HE REALIZED
THAT THUMPER HAD PROBABLY BEEN
HEARING THIS SAID AT HOME...
OVER AND OVER AND OVER
AND WAS PRETTY BORED WITH IT.
AND SO I HAD HIM JUST LOOKING
AT THE GROUND AFTER THAT.
AND HE SAYS, "ABOUT WHAT?"
WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING UP.
AND SHE SAYS, "YOU KNOW,
ABOUT EATING THE GREENS."
"OH, THAT ONE."
CLEARS HIS THROAT,
TURNS AROUND...
AND STARTS IN RECITING
HIS "EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT."
THUMPER?
YES, MAMA.
WHAT DID YOUR FATHER
TELL YOU?
'BOUT WHAT?
ABOUT EATING THE BLOSSOMS
AND LEAVING THE GREENS.
OH, THAT ONE.
AHEM! EATING GREENS
IS A SPECIAL TREAT.
IT MAKES LONG EARS
AND GREAT BIG FEET.
BUT IT SURE IS
AWFUL STUFF TO EAT.
I MADE THAT LAST PART UP MYSELF.
HIYA, BAMBI!
WATCH WHAT I CAN DO!
WHEE!
COME ON!
IT'S ALL RIGHT. LOOK.
THE WATER IS STIFF.
YIPPEE!
SOME FUN, HUH, BAMBI?
I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO SAY THAT
THE BIGGEST LAUGH IN BAMBI...
IS FRANK'S SECTION,
BAMBI AND THUMPER ON THE ICE.
AND AT ONE TIME, THE DIRECTOR
AND THE STORY PEOPLE...
WERE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING
THAT DOWN TO SOMETHING
MUCH LESS THAN THAT.
WORD CAME DOWN TO ME,
AND I'D BEEN PREPARING
TO ANIMATE THAT, AND I SAID,
"OH, GOLLY,
THEY CAN'T DO THAT!"
SO I SAID, "CAN I HAVE
THREE DAYS TO TRY TO SHOW YOU
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THERE?"
SO I MADE POSE TESTS
AND THINGS WHERE YOU JUST
MADE A FEW DRAWINGS...
AND HELD THEM FOR A LONGER TIME,
BUT STILL GAVE THE FEELING...
OF WHAT WOULD BE
IN THAT SEQUENCE.
BECAUSE OF MY OWN DIFFICULTIES
WITH ICE-SKATING, I WAS VERY
SYMPATHETIC TO BAMBI.
AND, UH, OF COURSE, THUMPER WAS
THE LITTLE SMART-ALECKY KIDS...
THAT CAME SKATING AROUND ME,
YOU KNOW, BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
AND THEN SWIRLING ALL AROUND.
KINDA WOBBLY, AREN'T YA?
AHEM!
YA GOTTA
WATCH BOTH ENDS
AT THE SAME TIME.
GUESS YOU BETTER
UNWIND IT.
WOW!
WE THINK THAT BAMBI WAS
WALT'S FAVORITE PICTURE.
ALL OUR FEATURES
WERE DIFFERENT,
BUT THIS ONE WAS
THE MOST DIFFERENT.
THE DEATH
OF THE MOTHER.
IT'S THE ONE PICTURE WHERE
SOMEBODY IS REALLY KILLED,
AND THERE'S NO FAIRY DUST
OR LOVER'S KISS TO BRING HER
BACK TO LIFE.
SHE'S DEAD, AND, UH,
I THINK THAT'S THE BIG THING
THAT MADE THIS SO DIFFERENT.
WELL, THE FACT
THAT YOU HAD ANIMALS TRYING
TO CARRY A WHOLE PICTURE.
WE'D NEVER DONE THAT,
AND WALT WASN'T SURE
THAT WE COULD DO IT,
AND A LOT OF US WEREN'T SURE
THAT WE COULD MAKE THE PICTURE.
SEVEN YEARS OF WORK,
UP AND DOWN, UP AND DOWN,
FINALLY ENDED WITH THE WAR.
WE JUST BARELY
GOT THE THING FINISHED
AFTER CUTTING IT ALL UP,
BUT IT STILL HAD
THAT DIFFERENT SPARK TO IT.
WE'LL TRY TO CATCH HER
BEFORE SHE GOES OUT TO LUNCH.
OKAY. I'LL GO GET
THE OTHER PHONE.
YOU CALL ME WHEN IT...
LET ME KNOW WHEN IT RINGS.
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S RINGING.
THE IDEA
OF FRANK AND OLLIE...
I MEAN, IT'S A TERM THAT IS
THROWN AROUND SO OFTEN...
THAT I THINK THAT THERE
ARE THOSE WHO ARE THERE
WHO DON'T KNOW...
FRANK AND OLLIE
IS NOT ONE PERSON.
I MEAN, THEY ARE TWO
SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS.
'CAUSE IT JUST FLOWS.
ONE... FRANK AND OLLIE.
HELLO?
HELLO.
FRANK AND OLLIE CALLING
FROM LOS ANGELES.
AS FAR AS FRANK AND OLLIE GOES,
THE MORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT
THEIR PAST HISTORY TOGETHER,
IT BECOMES MORE
AND MORE EXTRAORDINARY.
AND I GUESS IT'S KIND OF
AN ENIGMA TO ME...
BECAUSE I'M NOT
THAT CLOSE TO SOMEBODY...
I MEAN TO A MALE FRIEND...
AND IT'S AN ENIGMA TO ME.
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS THAT FUELS IT.
WHAT IS IT THAT GIVES IT LIFE?
UH, THAT'S THE MYSTERY
OF LOVE, I SUPPOSE.
I MEAN, THERE'S NEVER ANY...
NEVER ANY EXPLANATION FOR IT.
OH, THAT'S VILLAIN STUFF.
I DON'T WANT THAT.
THIS IS TOO.
DONALD STUFF. YEAH!
THIS IS... NO, THAT'S NOT...
GOTTA BE IN HERE.
DOGGONE IT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.
WHAT'D I DO WITH IT?
MARIE?
WHAT?
I CAN'T FIND
THAT DAMN DRAWING.
THAT'S PAR FOR THE COURSE.
- YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU?
- YES.
ALL RIGHT.
JUST A MINUTE.
SIEG HEIL!
SIEG HEIL!
BECAUSE OF THE WAR,
PINOCCHIO HAD NOT MADE MONEY.
DIDN'T EVEN PAY FOR ITSELF.
FANTASIA DID NOT MAKE MONEY,
AND BAMB THE KING OF THEM ALL,
FAILED TO MAKE MONEY.
AND IT WAS A VERY SAD TIME,
TO ME, FOR WALT,
AS WELL AS THE REST OF US,
BECAUSE WALT WAS CUT OFF
AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS.
HE WAS AT HIS MOST CREATIVE.
THERE'S JUST NO TELLING
WHERE HE WOULD HAVE GONE...
WITH THAT WONDERFUL
IMAGINATION THAT HE HAD...
WHAT HE COULDN'T DO.
EVERYTHING HE'D DONE
HAD BEEN A STEP FORWARD...
AND MORE CREATIVE
AND MORE IMAGINATIVE.
AND HERE, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THAT'S BROUGHT TO AN END.
WALT HAD BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTED
THAT FANTASIA DID NOT GO OVER...
BECAUSE HE FELT THAT WAS
A NEW FRONTIER FOR ANIMATION.
IT OPENED UP WHOLE NEW AREAS
THAT WE COULD PLAY WITH.
BUT THE AUDIENCE
DIDN'T GO FOR THAT.
HE LOST MONEY,
LOST MONEY.
FINALLY HE REALIZED,
"WELL, THE AUDIENCE WANTS
ANOTHER SNOW WHITE.
THEY WANT A GIRL
IN TROUBLE, BESET BY EVIL
AND SOMEBODY SAVES HER."
SO HE MADE CINDERELLA.
CINDERELLA MADE
AN EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS.
ALICE IN WONDERLAND
LOST A MILLION DOLLARS.
SO THE STUDIO REALLY WASN'T
IN THE BLACK UNTIL AFTER WE
GOT THE PARKS GOING...
AND TV CAME IN AND ALL THESE
OTHER INTERESTS OF WALT'S...
STARTED TO BRING IN MONEY FROM
SEVERAL DIFFERENT ENTERPRISES
AND NOT JUST THE PICTURES.
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME,
HE'D BEEN GOING THIS WAY,
AND WE STARTED GOING
THIS WAY, TRYING TO KEEP
THE PICTURES GOING...
WITH LESS AND LESS HELP
FROM WALT.
WE DECIDED THE BEST THING
FOR US TO DO WAS TO WORK ON
THE PERSONALITIES,
THE ACTING, THE ENTERTAINMENT
AS BEST WE COULD...
AND TRY TO COVER WHAT WALT
HAD GIVEN US BEFORE.
HE WAS STILL AROUND, BUT HE
WASN'T EXERCISING THE CONTROL
OVER THE FILMS...
THAT HE HAD ORIGINALLY.
EVENTUALLY, UH, DISNEY
HAD A FAVORITE PHALANX
OF ANIMATORS...
THAT HE CALLED
"THE NINE OLD MEN,"
AND, UH, EACH OF THEM
HAD CERTAIN STRENGTHS...
AND COMPLEMENTED THE OTHER.
UH, SOME OF THEM WERE
WONDERFUL DRAFTSMEN.
SOME WERE GOOD
WITH ZANY SEQUENCES
AND CHARACTERS.
OTHERS WERE
FEMALE CHARACTER SPECIALISTS.
FRANK AND OLLIE, OF COURSE,
WERE THE BEST WITH SINCERE,
EMOTIONAL ANIMATION.
AND WHAT WALT SAW
WAS THAT FRANK AND OLLIE...
WERE ABLE TO SUSPEND DISBELIEF
PICTURE AFTER PICTURE...
AND GO INTO WHATEVER
THE CHARACTER WAS...
AND SAY, "NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S A CHILD.
IT'S A FATHER, A MOTHER,
A SON, A DAUGHTER."
UH, THEY KEPT TELLING ME,
"YOUR WORK
HAS TO BE SINCERE."
AND... HOW DO YOU DRAW
SINCERE?
I MEAN, DO YOU PRESS HARDER
ON THE PENCIL?
EHHH! YOU KNOW, TO REALLY
GET TO THE HEART OF IT?
IT'S ONLY IN RETROSPECT
THAT I REALIZE THE THINGS
THEY WERE TELLING US WERE...
TRULY TRUE SECRETS
OF MAGIC, AS IT WERE.
THIS IS FRANK THOMAS,
ONE OF OUR KEY ANIMATORS.
HE'S MAKING THE DRAWINGS
THAT WILL ANIMATE PART OF
THE DIALOGUE SCENE...
WE HAVE JUST HEARD
RECORDED.
HE'S NOT JUST MAKING FACES
IN THE MIRROR FOR FUN.
HE'S MOUTHING THE WORDS
AS HE HEARS THEM.
THEN HE SKETCHES
THE POSITION OF HIS MOUTH...
SO THAT THE CHARACTER
HE'S DRAWING WILL APPEAR
TO BE SAYING THE WORDS.
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT
WE'VE GOT HERE NOW.
BY FLIPPING THESE DRAWINGS
AT THE SAME TIME AS WE PLAY THE
RECORD ON THE PLAYBACK MACHINE,
WE GET A PRETTY FAIR IDEA
OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE
ON THE SCREEN.
I'LL SHOW YA.
UH, WHAT'S A BABY?
UH, WHAT'S A BABY?
WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD,
I SAW LADY AND THE TRAMP,
AND...
MY RECOLLECTION OF IT...
IS JUST KIND OF
A HODGEPODGE OF IMAGES,
BUT ONE IMAGE OR SEQUENCE
THAT REALLY VIVIDLY
STANDS OUT IN MY MIND...
IS THE SPAGHETTI SEQUENCE.
IN THE HANDS
OF A LESSER ANIMATOR,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A HORRIBLE SCENE,
BUT WHAT FRANK DID WAS
NOTHING SHORT OF MIRACULOUS.
I LOVE THE LITTLE PERSONALITY
TOUCHES THAT HE GETS INTO IT.
UM, UH, TRAMP,
BEING A DOG OF THE STREETS,
IS NOT USED TO EATING
SUCH A WONDERFUL MEAL,
AND SO HE EATS TWICE AS MUCH
AS LADY DOES IN THE SEQUENCE.
AND LADY, WHO IS A PAMPERED
UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS DOG...
AND GETS HER, AT LEAST,
TWO SQUARE MEALS A DAY
PLUS SNACKS,
IS MORE INTERESTED IN
THE IMPROVISATIONAL SERENADE
THAT'S BEING PERFORMED FOR THEM.
UM, INADVERTENTLY, THEY CHEW ON
A SINGLE STRAND OF SPAGHETTI,
AND THEN THEIR MUZZLES MEET
AND THEY KISS.
IT'S A WONDERFUL MOMENT...
BECAUSE, UH, FRANK HAS LADY
REACTING JUST AS SHE SHOULD,
DEMURELY PULLING AWAY.
AND THEN TRAMP...
THERE'S A WONDERFUL DRAWING
AT THE END OF THE SEQUENCE...
IN WHICH HE NUZZLES OVER
A MEATBALL TO HER,
THE LAST ONE.
IT'S HIS GIFT TO HER.
AND I COULD SEE THAT
HE'S FALLING IN LOVE
WITH THIS DOG.
HE'S, UH...
IT SEEMS HE'S REFLECTING ON
WHAT THE CHEF TOLD HIM EARLIER.
HE SAYS, "THIS IS THE ONE
YOU SHOULD SETTLE DOWN WITH."
YOU CAN SEE IT
IN THE DRAWINGS.
YOU CAN SEE HE'S REALIZING
SHE'S WONDERFUL.
♪ ♪ ...WITH YOUR LOVED ONE
♪ YOU'LL FIND
ENCHANTMENT HERE ♪
♪ THE NIGHT WILL WEAVE
ITS MAGIC SPELL ♪ ♪
- ♪ WHEN THE ONE YOU LOVE...
- - DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A ROMANTIC?
YES. DON'T YOU?
AREN'T WE ALL?
YOU THINK OLLIE'S
A ROMANTIC TOO?
OH, VERY MUCH SO.
YEAH. YEAH, I'D...
YOU'D HAVE TROUBLE DEFINING
WHAT A ROMANTIC IS,
BUT I THINK IT HAS TO DO
A LOT, TO ME, WITH LIVING
WITH YOUR DREAMS,
AND, UH, DREAMING
QUITE A BIT ABOUT, UH,
OH, CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THINGS...
THE TREES, THE SKY,
THE GRASSES, THE BIRDS,
THE ANIMALS...
AND YOU BEING PART
OF THE WHOLE THING.
UH, A REALIST WOULD HAVE TROUBLE
WITH SOME OF THOSE CONCEPTS,
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO
INTO AN IMAGINARY FIELD
LIKE ANIMATION,
UH, YOU'D BETTER COME EQUIPPED
WITH THAT KIND OF NONSENSE.
RIGHT HERE.
NOW LET'S SEE.
PUT IT DOWN HERE.
AND THIS ONE...
IT WAS A WHOLE APPROACH
TOWARD LIFE, AND WALT
USED TO SAY,
"OUR WORK IS
A CARICATURE OF LIFE."
BUT THE LIFE THAT THEY
WERE CARICATURING, THEY FELT
IN VERY MUCH THE SAME WAY.
YOU CAN SEE IT WHEN HE WAS
TELLING ME ABOUT THEM, AND I HAD
NEVER MET THEM AT THIS TIME.
HE DESCRIBED OLLIE AS
"THE GUY WHO HAD THE TRAIN."
AND, OF COURSE, IT WAS
OLLIE'S PASSION FOR TRAINS...
THAT GOT WALT EXCITED
ABOUT TRAINS.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ENJOY VARIOUS HOBBIES,
AND AMONG THE LARGEST
OF THESE GROUPS ARE THE
MODEL RAILROAD ENTHUSIASTS.
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE,
THERE ARE ABOUT SIX MILLION
PEOPLE WHO BUILD AND OPERATE
THESE SCALE MODEL RAILROADS.
AND HERE AT THE STUDIO,
THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US
WHO HAVEN'T ESCAPED THE BUG.
ONE OF OUR KEY ANIMATORS,
OLLIE JOHNSTON,
IS ONE OF THESE
BACKYARD HOBBYISTS.
AFTER SITTING AT
THE DRAWING BOARD ALL DAY,
OLLIE FINDS GREAT RELAXATION
ON WEEKENDS GATHERING
THE FELLOW HOBBYISTS...
IN THE BACKYARD
OF HIS FLINTRIDGE HOME.
OLLIE ESTIMATES THAT IT TOOK
OVER 4,000 HOURS TO BUILD
HIS MODEL STEAM ENGINE,
PATTERNED AFTER
THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO.
ALL ABOARD!
WELL, I TELL YOU,
THE ONE THING THAT SAVED
MY LIFE... AND SAVED HIS...
WAS HIS INTEREST IN TRAINS...
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LEAVE
A JOB LIKE THAT AT 5:00 AND
CLOSE THE DOOR AND THAT'S IT.
YOU BRING ALL THESE
THOUGHTS HOME WITH YOU.
YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF.
I ALWAYS LOVED TO HEAR
FRANK PLAY THE PIANO MYSELF,
BUT I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD HAVE
SUCH AN IMPACT ON MY WIFE.
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME
SHE EVER HEARD HIM PLAY,
SHE WAS UP IN ABOUT TWO SECONDS
DOING THE CHARLESTON, YOU KNOW.
SHE CAN'T RESIST IT.
THAT'S ALL, FOLKS.
AND THE SAME THING
WITH FRANK AND THE MUSIC.
HE TOLD ME ABOUT FRANK AS
"THE MAN WHO PLAYS THE PIANO
IN THE FIREHOUSE FIVE   2."
BY DAY, THEY'RE ARTISTS, BUT
AT NIGHT, THEY BECOME THE MOST
FAMOUS NEW BAND IN THE COUNTRY.
FIREHOUSE FIVE   2.
I'VE DANCED TO THEIR MUSIC
AT NIGHT, AND NOW I'M CURIOUS:
CAN THE MAGIC MIRROR SHOW THEM
AT THEIR DAYTIME JOB?
SURE. BUT, EDGAR, I'D LIKE
TO SAY THIS ABOUT THE BOYS:
THEY NEVER LET THEIR MUSIC
INTERFERE WITH THEIR WORK.
YOU WATCH.
MIRROR, MIRROR, ON THE WALL,
SHOW THE HARDEST WORKERS
HERE OF ALL.
YES, MASTER.
MONTY. HEY, MONTY.
SEE IF WALT'S AROUND.
ALL CLEAR.
HE'S A HAM. THAT'S WHY
HE'S A GOOD ANIMATOR.
THAT'S WHY HIS PLAYING
WITH THE FIREHOUSE FIVE
WAS SO IMPORTANT,
BECAUSE IT WAS
AN EGO BOOSTER.
IT GAVE HIM THE RELEASE
THAT HE NEEDED...
TO PUT UP WITH THE FRUSTRATION
THAT HE HAD TO KEEP BOTTLED UP
DURING THE WEEK.
OH, I DON'T THINK
THERE WAS A DAY WENT BY...
THAT I DIDN'T FIGURE I WAS
IN THE WRONG PROFESSION...
AND THAT I SHOULD
GET OUT OF ANIMATION.
I'D GET SO MAD AT
SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING ON.
PART OF THE TIME,
IT WAS MY OWN INABILITY
TO DRAW WHAT I WANTED,
WHICH ALL OF US HAD.
I GUESS EVERY ARTIST
HAS THAT KIND OF PROBLEM.
YES, AND IN MY BOOK,
THAT'S BAD!
WELL, WHO'S THAT?
THANKS FOR BARKING.
YOU'RE SO FIERCE.
THEY BEEN WAITIN' FOR YOU.
YOU'RE SO FIERCE.
THEY COULDN'T WAIT
'TIL YOU GOT HERE.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS
OF ANIMATION IS OBSERVING...
SEEING THINGS AROUND YOU,
SEE WHAT PEOPLE DO AND LEARN THE
LITTLE TRAITS THAT THEY HAVE,
THE WAY THEY LOOK,
THE TIMING ON THEM.
YOU HAVE TO OBSERVE
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
YEAH, MY SON...
I KEPT WATCHING HIM
WHEN HE WAS A KID,
SUCKING HIS THUMB AND
HOLDING ONTO HIS EAR
WHILE HE DID IT,
AND I USED THAT
ON PRINCE JOHN.
DEAR MOTHER.
♪ ♪ MOTHER ALWAYS DID
LIKE RICHARD BEST.
WHICH EAR DID HE HOLD?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
HE... MY SON WOULD GO
FROM EAR TO EAR THIS WAY.
PRINCE JOHN'S ARMS
WEREN'T LONG ENOUGH
TO REACH AROUND TO DO THAT.
YOU DID IT ON...
ONE OF MY BOYS HAD A WAY WHEN HE
WAS SLEEPING AND HE WAS NERVOUS,
HE'D RUB HIS FEET TOGETHER
THIS WAY AS IF THERE WAS
SOME TENSION IN THERE.
I USED THAT ON PRINCE JOHN
WHILE ROBIN HOOD WAS
STEALING THE GOLD.
THEY WERE ROOMING THERE
IN THE SAME ROOMING HOUSE...
AND THEN EVENTUALLY
HAD AN APARTMENT TOGETHER,
AND THEN, WHEN
OLLIE AND MARIE MARRIED,
FRANK MOVED ACROSS THE HALL
TO A BACHELOR'S APARTMENT.
AND I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT
THREE YEARS LATER...
THAT HE FINALLY TALKED
JEANETTE, HIS WIFE,
INTO GETTING MARRIED.
SO NEXT THING I KNEW,
MARIE WAS HOUSE-HUNTING WITH ME,
AND WE FOUND A DUPLEX,
WHICH WE BOUGHT.
BEFORE THAT, EVEN,
OLLIE AND MARIE AND FRANK...
HAD BOUGHT THE PROPERTY
IN FLINTRIDGE.
AND SO WE WERE BOTH
PLANNING HOUSES
AT THE SAME TIME.
I THINK WE, UH,
MOVED IN A LITTLE BEFORE
FRANK AND JEANNETTE DID.
OUR HOUSE WAS FINISHED
A LITTLE SOONER.
I WAS PREGNANT.
THAT AUGUST, WE BOTH HAD BABIES
WITHIN A WEEK OF EACH OTHER...
OUR FIRST SONS.
WE HAD RICK
ON THE 1st OF AUGUST,
AND SIX DAYS LATER,
THEY HAD THEIR SON, GREGG.
OLLIE AND FRANK CONTINUED
TO DRIVE TO WORK
AND BACK TO WORK...
AND DRIVE TO WORK
AND BACK TO WORK.
THIS WENT ON...
AND ON.
YEAH, THIS ONE HERE,
I FEEL...
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
BUB, BUT I FEEL
IT OUGHT TO BE USED...
EVEN THOUGH
WE'VE ALREADY GOT
A COLOR ONE OF IT.
OH, THIS IS OF CHERNABOG
FROM FANTASIA.
DON'T DECIDE
ANYTHING YET.
I FEEL LIKE THIS ONE...
NOT JUST BECAUSE
IT'S A BIGGER TRANSPARENCY...
BUT I FEEL LIKE IT SHOWS THE GUY
UP ON THE MOUNTAIN BETTER.
YEAH.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE
THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED TOO.
A GOOD
FOLD-OUT THING.
YEAH.
IT WOULD MAKE
A GREAT FOLD-OUT.
I'D BUY THAT.
WONDER IF THEY WILL.
I WAS IN
A REGULAR CAR POOL,
BUT WHEN WE HAD A DATE,
I'D RIDE HOME WITH
FRANK AND OLLIE.
AND THEY DID LET ME SIT
IN THE MIDDLE. THEY DIDN'T
PUSH ME TO THE BACKSEAT.
BUT I SOON FOUND OUT
THAT I WASN'T TO TALK...
UNTIL WE GOT
TO A CERTAIN STREET.
I'VE FORGOTTEN THE NAME
OF THE STREET NOW.
IT'S BEEN 50 YEARS.
FRANK AND I STARTED
RIDING TOGETHER
BACK IN ART SCHOOL,
AND THAT CONTINUED ON
AFTER WE BOTH GOT INTO DISNEY'S,
SO OVER THE YEARS,
WE HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.
AND WE LEARNED HOW
EACH OF US THOUGHT...
AND HOW WE APPROACHED
OUR PROBLEMS...
AND WHAT WE'RE WEAK IN
OR STRONG IN.
WHERE OTHER FELLOWS
WOULD STOP AT 5:00...
AND JUST GO HOME
AND DO SOMETHING ELSE,
WE STILL HAD 20 MINUTES
TO A HALF HOUR TO 45 MINUTES
AT ONE TIME...
TO TALK ABOUT THE PICTURE
AND WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT
AND WHAT IT NEEDED...
AND THE SCENES
THAT WE HAD COMING UP.
SO IN THE MORNING,
YOU'D START OUT WITH ALL THESE
HOT IDEAS, TALK THEM OVER.
COMING HOME, YOU'D BE TALKING
ABOUT, "GEE, I DON'T KNOW.
THIS SURE DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL."
WHEN YOU GOT TO WORK THE NEXT
MORNING, YOU HAD A PRETTY CLEAR
IDEA WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO.
SO I'D MAKE A LOT OF LITTLE
THUMBNAILS... YOU KNOW,
LITTLE BITTY DRAWINGS...
WORKING OUT THE CONTINUITY AND
THE EXPRESSIONS AND THE THINGS
I THOUGHT YOU'D GET ON THERE.
I'D TAKE THEM INTO OLLIE
AND SAY, "IS THIS WHAT
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE?
IS THIS WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT?"
HE'D SAY, "WELL, YEAH, UH...
WEREN'T YOU GOING TO DO
SOMETHING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING WITH THE ARM."
"OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH."
"AND THEN DOWN HERE..."
"YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW."
I'D TRY TO GET IT AWAY FROM HIM.
HE'D SAY, "NO, NO,
YOU GOTTA DO THIS."
HE'D CALL OUT
THE CHANGES HE SAW. THEN
I'D TAKE IT BACK TO THE ROOM...
AND I'D WORK ON MY SCENE
ON THAT BASIS.
SO I'D TAKE A DRAWING
IN TO HIM,
AND HE'D MAKE SOME
LITTLE SCRIBBLES OVER IT.
HE WOULDN'T TRY TO MAKE
A REAL FANCY DRAWING.
HE'D JUST POINT OUT
WHAT HE THOUGHT
MAYBE I WAS MISSING...
OR MAYBE HE'D POINT OUT
WHAT HE LIKED ABOUT MY DRAWING,
WHICH I DIDN'T SEE.
AND IN THE END, I'D END UP
WITH A MUCH BETTER DRAWING.
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
BY MYSELF.
ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR
A WHITE RABBIT, SO, UM,
IF YOU DON'T MIND...
EH? OH!
THERE HE IS!
I SIMPLY MUST GET THROUGH!
SORRY. YOU'RE MUCH TOO BIG.
SIMPLY IMPASSABLE.
- YOU MEAN IMPOSSIBLE.
- NO, IMPASSABLE.
NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WE WORKED TOGETHER
ON ALICE IN WONDERLAN TOO.
I HAD THE DOORKNOB.
I HAD ALICE.
YEAH, LUCKY YOU.
YEAH.
TOUGH ONE.
WE HAD THE TWO CHARACTERS
PLAYING AGAINST EACH OTHER,
AND WE RAN INTO
AN INTERESTING PROBLEM...
BECAUSE I NEEDED
CERTAIN LINES OF DIALOGUE...
WHERE I COULD GET
THE DOORKNOB TO WORK PROPERLY.
YOU KNOW, WORKING HIS MOUTH.
HE ALWAYS WANTED THE STUFF...
I WANTED THE STUFF WHERE I COULD
HAVE ALICE NOT SAYING ANYTHING.
IT WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER.
I DIDN'T WANT THOSE LINES.
HE HAD TO ANIMATE...
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
HAVING A DOORKNOB WHEN HE
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO.
BUT LOOK!
I'M JUST THE RIGHT SIZE!
OH. NO USE.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
I'M LOCKED!
- OH, NO!
- BUT OF COURSE,
YOU'VE GOT THE KEY, SO...
- WHAT KEY?
- NOW DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE LEFT IT UP THERE.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
I'M LOCKED.
OH, NO!
OH, NO!
YOU KNOW, WHEN WALT
WAS LOOKING AT THIS STUFF,
HE SAID, "DID YOU DO
ALL THESE ALICES?"
AND I SAID, "YEAH."
HE SAYS, "WE'LL HAVE TO PUT YOU
ON WENDY IN PETER PAN."
I SAID TO WALT,
"THAT'LL KILL HIM."
SO HE PUT ME ON MR. SMEE.
EVEN THERE, WE HAD ARGUMENTS
ABOUT WHICH CHARACTER WAS
GONNA GET THE LINES HE WANTS.
I HAD CAPTAIN HOOK,
AND IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
THAT HE HAVE CERTAIN LINES...
WHERE HE COULD GESTURE
AND BE THE GRAND FELLOW
THAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS.
LOTS OF TIMES I WANTED
THAT PART ON MR. SMEE SO
I COULD SHOW HIM REACTING.
I HAD A SCENE WITH CAPTAIN HOOK
PLAYING THE PIANO IN PETER PAN.
AND I WONDERED,
"HOW CAN HE PLAY THE PIANO
WITH A HOOK?"
SO I ASKED OLLIE WALLACE,
WHO IS A VERY GOOD
PIANIST AND ORGANIST.
HAD A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
AND I SAID, "OLLIE,
WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?
"CAN YOU... SOMETHIN' HE
COULD DO WITH THE HOOK?
HE COULD SORT OF RATTLE IT HERE
BETWEEN A COUPLE OF NOTES?"
♪ DE-DA DE-DAY-DA
DE-DAY-DA ♪ ♪
HE COULDN'T DO THAT,
BUT HE COULD DO A THING
WHERE HE GOES:
♪ RRUMP, DERUMP
DERUMP, DERUMP, BING ♪ ♪
SOMEHOW THEY'RE ABLE
TO USE THEIR IMAGINATIONS...
TO FIT INTO ALL SORTS
OF RELATIONSHIPS.
AND THE INCREDIBLE THING IS,
YOU THEN HAVE...
MORE OF A FEELING OF REALITY...
BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST
A GOOD CARTOON CHARACTER.
IT'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE
THINKING AND FEELING AND
BOUNCING OFF OF EACH OTHER.
YES, MISS BELL.
CAPTAIN HOOK ADMITS DEFEAT.
TOMORROW I LEAVE THE ISLAND,
NEVER TO RETURN.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT,
CAP'N.
I'LL TELL THE CREW AND...
AND THAT'S WHY
I ASKED YOU OVER, ME DEAR:
TO TELL PETER
I BEAR HIM NO ILL WILL.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE SEQUENCES
THAT FRANK ANIMATED...
WAS THE SQUIRREL SEQUENCE FROM
SWORD AND THE STONE.
MERLIN AND WART ARE
TEMPORARILY SQUIRRELS AND
TRAVELING THROUGH THE WOODS,
AND A YOUNG GIRL SQUIRREL
HAPPENS TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH ARTHUR.
LOOK, I'M NOT A BOY.
I MEAN...
- I'M NOT A SQUIRREL.
- I'M A BOY.
A HUMAN BOY,
NOT A... NOT A REAL SQ...
OH... LEAVE ME ALONE!
SHOO-WOO!
IT'S SUCH A VIVID DESCRIPTION
OF FALLING IN LOVE.
BUT A VERY POIGNANT
KIND OF LOVE...
THE KIND OF LOVE WHERE YOU FALL
MADLY IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY...
AND THEN AFTER YOU'RE IN LOVE,
YOU DISCOVER THEY'RE NOTHING
LIKE YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE.
IN THIS CASE, LITERALLY,
A DIFFERENT SPECIES.
AND, UH, WE'VE ALL HAD
RELATIONSHIPS LIKE THAT,
HAVEN'T WE?
MERLIN!
OH.
SO HERE WE ARE.
QUICK, MERLIN,
THE MAGIC.
SNICK, SNACK, SNORUM!
THERE. NOW YOU SEE?
I'M NOT A SQUIRREL.
I'M A BOY.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU.
I-I'M A BOY.
A HUMAN BOY.
OH. IF YOU COULD
ONLY UNDERSTAND.
YOU KNOW, LAD,
THAT LOVE BUSINESS
IS A POWERFUL THING.
GREATER THAN GRAVITY?
WELL, YES, BOY,
IN ITS WAY.
I'D, UH...
YES, I'D SAY...
IT'S THE GREATEST
FORCE ON EARTH.
LET'S NOT BE SILLY.
TOO LATE.
OF ALL THE GREAT
LAUGHING SCENES
IN DISNEY ANIMATION,
I THINK MY FAVORITE
IS OLLIE JOHNSTON'S IN
THE SWORD AND THE STONE...
WHEN YOU HAVE ARCHIMEDES
LAUGHING SO HARD AT
MERLIN'S IDEA...
THAT MAN SOMEDAY
IS GONNA FLY...
THAT HE CAN'T GET HIS BREATH.
THERE SHE GOES.
NO, NO, NO!
HO, HO, HO!
MAN'LL FLY, ALL RIGHT.
HO, HO, HO, HO!
JUST LIKE A ROCK.
IT WOULD HAVE WORKED
IF-IF-IF-IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THIS INFERNAL BEARD.
I NEVER...
NEVER IN MY WHOL...
YOU KNOW, AN ANIMATED CHARACTER
NEVER DOES ANYTHING ON ITS OWN.
IF IT MAKES TOO BIG A MOVE
SOMEWHERE, IT'S YOUR FAULT,
NOT THE CHARACTER'S FAULT.
AND THAT'S TRUE.
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL...
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU THINK
YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING...
HAVE A HAND DO SOMETHING
OR MOVE THEIR HEAD
IN A CERTAIN WAY.
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
TO SEE THE EXPRESSION...
OR LINGER ON THE BODY ATTITUDE
OR SOMETHING THAT'S...
WHETHER IT'S SAD OR
WHETHER IT'S HAPPY...
WHATEVER IT IS...
SO THAT YOU COMMUNICATE THAT
WITHOUT COMPLICATING IT.
UH, PENNY...
A SCENE THAT OLLIE DID...
PENNY'S SITTING ON THE BED
IN THE ORPHANAGE,
AND SHE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE,
"WELL, THEY HAD ADOPTION DAY
AT THE ORPHANAGE,
"AND A MAN AND A WOMAN
CAME AND LOOKED AT ME,
"BUT THEY CHOOSED THE LITTLE
REDHEADED GIRL INSTEAD...
BECAUSE SHE WAS PRETTIER."
THAT WASN'T A CHILD
THAT WAS PLAYING THAT SCENE.
IT WAS A DRAWING.
SHE LOOKED AWFUL SAD...
AND SO I ASKED HER:
WHAT'S WRONG,
PENNY, HONEY?
NOTHING.
OH, COME ON NOW.
COME ON. NO SECRETS.
YOU TELL OLD RUFUS, HUH?
WELL, IT WAS
ADOPTION DAY
AT THE ORPHANAGE.
WHAT... WHAT HAPPENED?
A MAN AND A LADY CAME
AND LOOKED AT ME,
BUT THEY CHOOSED
THE LITTLE REDHEADED GIRL.
SHE WAS PRETTIER
THAN ME.
OH!
SHE COULDN'T BE!
YOU... NOW, YOU LISTEN
TO ME, DARLIN'.
YOU'RE SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL.
NO, I'M NOT.
WHY, SOMEDAY...
A MAMA AND A PAPA WILL
COME TO THE ORPHANAGE...
A-LOOKIN' FOR
A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL
JUST LIKE YOU.
HONEST?
HAVE TO RUN CAPTIONS.
THIS SHOULD BE AT...
WE HAVE WALT'S ACTUAL WORDS
FROM THE STORY MEETING NOTES.
DO THEY SAY ENOUGH
OR SHOULD WE ADD SOMETHIN'?
MMM, I'D HAVE TO SEE IT...
WITH THE DRAWING?
YEAH, I'D HAVE TO SEE IT
WITH THE DRAWINGS,
BUT WE GOT
A WHOLE SERIES THERE
THAT ARE REALLY GOOD...
WHERE HE FIRST STARTS
CHANGING AND PINOCCHIO
STARTS LAUGHING AT HIM...
AND THEN HE GOES OVER
AND GRABS HOLD OF PINOCCHIO.
I THINK THE REASON THAT
OLLIE AND I HAVE GOTTEN ALONG...
AS WELL AS WE HAVE
OVER THE YEARS...
IS BECAUSE
WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE,
AND FOR MANY YEARS, WE SPOKE
THE SAME LANGUAGE AS WALT.
THERE'S A TRUTH
AND AN HONESTY THERE...
THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS FIND
IN FAIRLY CLOSE FRIENDS.
SOMEBODY ALWAYS WANTS TO DO
A LITTLE ONE-UPMANSHIP
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
BUT THERE'S NEVER
ANY OF THAT WITH US.
IT ISN'T THE TYPE OF THING YOU
GO AROUND THINKING, "GEE, I GOT
A GOOD FRIEND," OR SOMETHING.
I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND, BY GOLLY,
WE HAD A WAY
OF WORKING TOGETHER...
THAT REALLY BENEFITED
BOTH OF US.
WE EACH LIFTED THE OTHER UP
TO SOMETHING HE COULDN'T DO
BY HIMSELF.
NOT THAT
THEY DON'T DISAGREE.
THEY DO. BUT THEY
HAVE A WAY OF SAYING,
"WELL, UH, OLLIE,
"I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD WORK.
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S..."
"OH." AND OLLIE
WOULD LISTEN, AND
THEY'D TALK IT OUT.
THEY MAY NOT HAVE ARRIVED
AT FRANK'S SOLUTION, BUT THEY'VE
COME SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
I'VE BEEN AMAZED AT
THE WAY THEY... THEY
NEVER LOSE THEIR TEMPER.

JUNGLE BOOK, UH, OF COURSE,
WAS A VERY IMPORTANT
AND PIVOTAL PICTURE,
NOT JUST IN THE CAREERS
OF FRANK AND OLLIE
BUT, I THINK,
FOR THE HISTORY AND FUTURE
OF DISNEY ANIMATION.
WALT DISNEY DIED
DURING THE MAKING OF IT,
SO THE NINE OLD MEN
WERE ON THEIR OWN,
AND, UH, HAD THAT FILM FAILED,
I THINK THAT DISNEY ANIMATION
MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE GONE
DOWN THE TUBES.
IT'S ALSO IMPRESSIVE TO ME
THAT FRANK AND OLLIE...
ANIMATED MORE THAN
HALF OF THE PICTURE THEMSELVES.
PRACTICALLY ALL OF
THE SCENES AND SEQUENCES
OF BALOO AND MOWGLI...
THAT WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP
THAT DEVELOPS AND CHANGES
THROUGHOUT THE PICTURE...
WAS FRANK AND OLLIE'S WORK.
FRANK AND I HAD THESE
TWO BACK-TO-BACK SEQUENCES...
THAT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT
TO THE PICTURE.
WITHOUT THESE
COMING OFF PROPERLY,
ALL THIS CHARACTER WORK
WE HAD DONE WOULDN'T PAY OFF.
THE SECTION THAT I HAD
CERTAINLY TESTED ME,
AND I THINK IT TESTED OUR
FRIENDSHIP BECAUSE I HAD TO
RELY SO MUCH ON FRANK FOR HELP,
AND I THINK
HE RELIED ON ME
IN HIS SEQUENCE.
AND IT WAS TERRIBLY
IMPORTANT THAT WE
MAKE THESE COME OFF.
THIS WAS THE TYPE OF THING
WALT TALKED ABOUT
WHEN HE SAID:
"YOU GUYS GET
THAT PERSONALITY. I'LL
TAKE CARE OF THE STORY."
YEAH, BUT THIS IS
A TOUGH PART OF THE STORY
BECAUSE, UH,
THE STORY WOULDN'T HOLD UP
WITHOUT THESE TWO SEQUENCES
IN THEM.
IT WAS TESTING THE FRIENDSHIP
OF BALOO AND MOWGLI,
AND IT WAS ALSO TESTING
OUR ABILITIES AS ANIMATORS.
THAT'S RIGHT, AND ALSO,
THE TOUGH THING WAS THAT...
BALOO WAS PUT ON THE SPOT
IN THIS.
BAGHEERA TELLS HIM HE
HAS TO TAKE THE KID BACK
TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
AND HE SAYS, "WHY ME?"
BALOO HAD NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.
HE WAS
THE PHYSICAL TYPE.
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO
ANYTHING WHERE YOU HAD TO FIGURE
OUT A PROBLEM IN YOUR MIND.
IT WAS ALL COMPLETELY
IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM.
AND MOST OF MY SEQUENCE...
WENT ON WITH JUST TALKING,
NO REAL MOVEMENT.
THEY'RE JUST STANDING...
BAGHEERA AND BALOO...
TALKING.
WELL... WELL, WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE'LL DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE BOY.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
YOU NAME IT AND I'LL DO IT.
GOOD.
THEN MAKE MOWGLI GO
TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
I PROMISED HIM HE COULD STAY
HERE IN THE JUNGLE WITH ME.
THAT'S JUST THE POINT.
AS LONG AS HE REMAINS WITH YOU,
HE'S IN DANGER.
SO IT'S
UP TO YOU.
WHY ME?
B-BECAUSE HE WON'T
LISTEN TO ME.
BUT I LOVE THAT KID.
I LOVE HIM
LIKE HE WAS MY OWN CUB.
THEN THINK OF WHAT'S
BEST FOR MOWGLI
AND NOT YOURSELF!
BUT... WELL, CAN'T...
WELL, CAN'T I WAIT
UNTIL MORNING?
IT'S MORNING NOW.
GO ON, BALOO.
UH...
AND NOW THE SITUATION CHANGES
WHEN THE BEAR HAS TO TALK
TO THE BOY...
AND TELL HIM THAT THEY'RE GONNA
GO BACK TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
HE KNOWS THIS IS GONNA BE
A TERRIBLE BETRAYAL ON HIS PART.
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL
THE BOY. HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY TO HIM...
'CAUSE THEY BUILT EVERYTHING
ON THEIR TRUST
AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP.
AND MOWGLI'S SO HAPPY
AT THE IDEA OF HAVING THIS
WONDERFUL DAY WITH BALOO.
HE'S RUNNING ALL AROUND,
PULLING BALOO'S HAND,
KICKING HIM IN THE PANTS,
CLIMBING UP ON THINGS,
CHASING BUTTERFLIES.
HE'S JUST IN ECSTASY.
THIS IS REALLY
THE PAYOFF SEQUENCE
RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS... BECAUSE
THE BETRAYAL COMES HERE.
YOU HAD TO FEEL AND
UNDERSTAND WHAT BALOO
WAS SAYING AND FEELING.
YEAH, WE HAD TO DO
AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK TOGETHER...
TRYING TO WORK OUT
HOW THE BEAR WOULD ACT,
WHAT GESTURES HE WOULD USE,
WHAT TYPE OF ACTING,
WHAT EXPRESSIONS HE WOULD USE.
HOW'S HE GOING TO PLAY THIS?
AND HOW'S THE BOY
GOING TO PLAY IT TOO?
FIRST WE THOUGHT OF THINGS LIKE
A HAND ON THE FACE...
YOU KNOW, RUBBING THE CHIN.
"GEE, WHAT CAN I SAY
TO THIS GUY?"
OR...
THINGS LIKE THAT.
WALLACE BEERY USED TO DO THAT,
AND IT WAS PRETTY EFFECTIVE.
OLLIE SUGGESTED THAT
THE HAND SHOULD BE BACK HERE,
RUBBING THE BACK OF HIS NECK.
WE'D ALREADY USED THIS
RUBBING-THE-ARM THING.
HOW ABOUT... POUNDING?
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW. THE BEST, THOUGH,
THE ONE THAT COMMUNICATED
THE BEST TO THE AUDIENCE, TO ME,
WAS ONE THAT STARTED HERE
AND THEN PULLED OFF
AND CAME AROUND TO THE FACE...
BUT DIDN'T STAY ON THE FACE;
IT CAME DOWN HERE TO THE CHEST.
I KNEW A GUY IN THE ARMY WHO
USED TO SCRATCH HIS CHEST ALL
THE TIME WHEN HE WAS THINKING.
THIS WAY. AND I...
"OH, MAYBE THAT'S
THE BEST THING TO DO."
WHERE WE GOIN',
BALOO?
WELL, UH,
IT'S, UH, UM...
WELL, IT'S SORT OF
NEW AND, UH...
OH, I DON'T CARE,
AS LONG AS I'M WITH YOU.
MOWGLI, UH,
LOOK, BUDDY, UH,
THERE'S SOMETHIN'
I GOTTA TELL YA.
TELL ME WHAT, BALOO?
GEE WHIZ.
NOW HOW DID OLD BAGGIE PUT IT?
UM, UH, MOWGLI?
HA! YOU WOULDN'T MARRY
A PANTHER, WOULD YOU?
GEE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.
MOWGLI, DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT YOU'RE A HUMAN?
I'M NOT ANYMORE, BALOO.
I'M A BEAR, LIKE YOU.
LITTLE BUDDY, LOOK.
LISTEN TO ME.
COME ON, BALOO!
NOW, MOWGLI, STOP IT NOW.
NOW HOLD STILL.
I WANNA TELL YOU SOMETHING.
NOW LISTEN TO ME!
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
OLD PAPA BEAR?
LOOK, MOWGLI, I BEEN TRYIN'
TO TELL YOU. I BEEN TRYIN'
ALL MORNING TO TELL YOU.
I'VE GOT TO TAKE YOU
BACK TO THE MAN-VILLAGE.
- THE MAN-VILLAGE!
- NOW LOOK, KID.
I CAN EXPLAIN...
- BUT YOU SAID WE WERE PARTNERS.
- NOW BELIEVE ME, KID, I...
- YOU'RE JUST LIKE OLD BAGHEERA.
- NOW JUST A MINUTE!
THAT'S GOIN' TOO FAR!
THERE'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM.
NOW HOW WE GONNA GET THE
BOY BACK INTO THE MAN-VILLAGE...
WITHOUT BALOO AND BAGHEERA
PUSHING HIM IN?
WELL, WALT HAD AN IDEA
TO ADD A GIRL...
THAT CAME OUT OF
THE MAN-VILLAGE, A LITTLE
GIRL ABOUT MOWGLI'S AGE.
AND MOWGLI'S NEVER SEEN
A GIRL LIKE THIS BEFORE.
HE SAYS, "WAIT A MINUTE.
I WANT A BETTER LOOK."
FORGET ABOUT THOSE.
THEY AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT TROUBLE.
JUST A MINUTE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE IDEA WHEN
I FIRST HEARD IT.
HERE'S THIS
TACKED-ON ENDING.
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?
THAT'S WHY WE GAVE IT
TO YOU TO ANIMATE.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
AND I WRESTLED
WITH IT, AND THE MORE
I WRESTLED WITH IT,
THE BETTER I LIKED IT.
AND SO FINALLY,
I MANAGED TO HELP
THIS LITTLE GIRL...
KIND OF INNOCENTLY SEDUCE
MOWGLI GOING BACK INTO
THE MAN-VILLAGE.
I WOULD HAVE SAID
"LURE" HIM.
MOWGLI. COME BACK.
COME BACK!
GO ON! GO ON!
AS IT TURNED OUT,
THAT MEETING WE HAD
ON OLLIE'S LITTLE GIRL...
WAS THE LAST MEETING
WE EVER HAD WITH WALT.
WE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW ILL HE WAS.
TWO MONTHS LATER
HE WAS GONE,
AND HE NEVER DID GET
TO SEE THE FINAL PICTURE.
WHEN WALT DIED,
IT LEFT A BIG HOLE
IN ALL OF OUR LIVES.
UH,
HE WAS A FRIEND...
A CLOSE FRIEND IN MANY WAYS,
AND YET HE ALWAYS
DISTANCED HIMSELF
FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.
HE WAS A GENIUS.
HE LIVED HIS WHOLE LIFE...
IN HIS OWN MIND,
IN HIS OWN HEART.
BUT HE COULDN'T HELP BUT AFFECT
ALL THE REST OF US VERY DEEPLY.
AND EVEN THOUGH HE'D NOT
BEEN WORKING WITH US CLOSELY...
FOR, OH, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN YEARS,
IT WAS STILL
A DEVASTATING MOMENT,
AND, UH, THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGED
AS FAR AS WE WERE CONCERNED.
WE KEPT THINKING BACK
OVER THOSE DAYS WHEN
YOU'D WORK SO HARD...
ALL OF US, WALT INCLUDED...
TRYING TO CAPTURE
SOMETHING RARE,
SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING UNIQUE IN
THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.
ISN'T IT TERRIBLE TO THINK
THAT IF JUNGLE BOOK HAD NOT
BEEN A SUCCESS,
THERE WOULD BE NO MORE
DISNEY ANIMATION?
EXECUTIVES WERE TALKING
ABOUT PHASING IT OUT.
"COSTS TOO MUCH MONEY.
ANYWAY, THERE'S NOBODY
TO TAKE OVER.
YOU'D HAVE TO REBUILD
THE WHOLE TEAM."
AND THEN PEOPLE WENT INTO
THE THEATERS TO SEE JUNGLE BOOK.
THEY LOOKED UP ON THE SCREEN,
AND THEY SAW A BEAR NAMED BALOO
AND A BOY NAMED MOWGLI,
AND THEY CAME TO LIFE,
CROWDS FLOCKED IN,
AND THE WHOLE CYCLE
STARTED OVER AGAIN.

THAT WAS UNIQUE. THE ART THAT
THEY CAME OUT WITH WAS UNIQUE
AND WILL NEVER BE REPEATED.
I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER SEE
FINER PERSONALITY ANIMATION...
THAN WAS DONE
BY FRANK AND OLLIE.
BUT I THINK IT'S NOT
A CLOSED DOOR. I THINK IT'S
AN OPEN DOOR TO THE FUTURE.
THERE'S A VERSE THAT MEANS
A LOT TO ME IN PROVERBS.
IT SAYS, "AS IRON SHARPENS IRON,
SO ONE MAN SHARPENS ANOTHER."
AND THROUGH THIS PROCESS
OF THEM CONSTANTLY WORKING
WITH ONE ANOTHER,
CONSTANTLY RUBBING AGAINST ONE
ANOTHER THROUGH THE DIFFERENT
FILMS THAT THEY'D WORK ON,
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS,
I COULD STILL SEE
THAT THAT WAS A PROCESS...
THAT WAS STILL GOING ON
WHEN I WAS THERE WITH THEM.
WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE, THEY
WERE STILL ARGUING ABOUT THE WAY
THEY WOULD SEE SOMETHING.
THEY WERE WORKING ON IT.
YOU COULD SEE THEM
IN THE HALLWAY.
THEY WERE CONSTANTLY
RUBBING THESE IDEAS ACROSS
ONE ANOTHER'S SURFACE...
'CAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THAT WAS
AS A TEAM OF PEOPLE.
...SHOTS OF CRUELLA
AND THE BADUNS.
THERE WAS KEN ANDERSON'S
GOOD EXPERIMENTAL DRAWINGS.
OH, YEAH.
THOSE ARE GREAT.
WE'LL XEROX THE...
HOLD ON A MINUTE.
I'LL CHANGE THE SPRINKLER HERE.
THERE. YOU GOT IT.
DON'T TRIP OVER IT.
I WON'T.
THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY.

Poor baby. I used to be just like you.
A child of the night, wild and free.
I was the cat who walked by herself, and the city was my hunting ground.
I'd prowl through Gotham each evening...
... going where I liked and taking whatever I wanted.
Until I met him.
I gave him my best fight, but in the end...
... kitty got her claws clipped.
Had to promise I'd be a good little pet and walk on a leash.
Even if it killed me.
Oh, you just say that to all the beautiful girls.
Selina? Excuse me.
Selina?
"Extinction." I can relate to that.
You're in a cheery mood.
Giving up Catwoman hasn't been easy, Bruce.
I miss the excitement, the danger.
Sometimes I feel so tempted.
- Even though you'd be risking prison?
- Tell me I'm not in a cage now.
Bruce Wayne. I wondered where you'd been hiding yourself.
And whom, may I ask, is your attractive date?
- Veronica Vreeland, meet Selina Kyle.
- We've met.
- At the wildlife fundraiser last year?
- Oh, of course.
- Love what you've done to your hair.
- Thanks.
Since you're so devoted to wildlife, Selina...
...I can't wait to hear what you think of the museum's new conservation hall.
I had it built in honor of my grandfather, Stanton Vreeland.
He was the first to realize the importance of preserving rare animals.
Not surprising, considering how many of them he obliterated.
Excuse me?
Stanton Vreeland was a playboy sportsman who'd shoot anything...
...that wandered into his gunsight.
He had to preserve animals...
...or he'd have nothing left to shoot.
- Is that right?
Most of these critters are gone thanks to trigger-happy jerks...
...like old Grandpa.
- Selina.
But, Bruce, Miss Vreeland asked me what I thought.
I think you've said enough.
Yes, perhaps I have.
Just once I'd like to throw a party without some kook showing up.
Excuse me.
Well, that was pretty rude.
Just the cat in me, I guess.
Look, Bruce, it was sweet of you to invite me, but I don't fit in here.
Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in anywhere.
Taxi.
- Your ride, Miss Kyle.
- Hey. What the...?
- Let me out, you big ape.
- She's a live one.
In two seconds, that'll be more than I can say about you.
Calm down, pussycat.
We're all friends here.
Dummy, don't keep our pretty guest in the dark.
Yes, sir, Mr. ScarFace.
That's better.
You gotta be kidding.
What's she laughing at?
My fly ain't open, is it?
- No, sir.
- So, what's the gag?
Oh, come on. You know.
"What's the gag?"
Can it, sister. This is ScarFace you're dealing with...
...and I don't stand for no disrespect.
I'd do as he says, ma'am.
Mr. ScarFace can be quite insistent.
I don't think anyone's talking to you.
- No, sir. No, sir.
- Right.
- What do you want with me?
- My boys happened to be in the museum...
...when they saw your little set-to with Miss Ronnie V.
They also seen you licking your whiskers at the sight of Ronnie's pretty sparklers.
You're boring me, log.
What if I could provide you with a foolproof plan for snatching those rocks...
...with no risk of you getting caught?
Pass. Kitty's been staying in at night.
Not the greatest, but it beats the pound, if you know what I mean.
That's a darn shame. I thought for sure you'd want a chance to get even...
...with the Vreelands. Not just for yourself, you understand...
...but for all those poor little stuffed critters what never had the chance to fight back.
- Oh, barf.
- It's a fifty-fifty cut.
Take it or leave it.
You in, or what?
You know what, Isis?
Extinction's for wimps.
Mastodon, check.
Cave bear, check.
Saber-tooth.
Well, where did you come from?
Poor girl. Must've wandered in and got lost.
I'll let you out back.
Excuse me, Mr. ScarFace, but isn't it cruel to take advantage of that nice Miss Kyle?
Hold my hat, will you?
That's what you get for going soft on me.
Yes, sir.
There. The guard's putting the cat out like I planned.
Catwoman should have all the time she needs to lift the jewels and split.
This one's for the Vreelands.
But plans can change, can't they, Rhino?
Right, boss.
Great. Someone else is hitting the place.
Okay, boys, to work.
Sorry, kitty. You're taking the fall.
Hold it.
Could you please give me a hand?
This dinosaur seems to have fallen on me.
- How did you...?
- It's a dull story, handsome.
The Catwoman. Watch out.
- Where is she?
- Couldn't have missed her.
Looks like the hunt's on again, Isis.
I think a quick trip out of town is in order.
Don't buy your ticket yet.
What a pleasant surprise.
Though I should warn you, breaking and entering is against the law.
You would know. Care to explain what you were doing at the museum tonight?
Look, I was there earlier for a party, and I kind of lost my temper.
I went back to apologize, and the place was empty, except for the burglars.
I had my outfit in the car, and I thought if I nailed the robbers...
...I could work up some points with the cops.
Maybe even with you.
I know how bad this looks for me, but it wasn't my fault.
Would you come back to the museum and talk to the authorities?
I suppose, if you're with me.
- After all, we do make a good team.
- When we're on the same side.
The police are still talking to the guard.
That gives us a few minutes to look around.
I was looking at this exhibit earlier.
It's brand-new. Why would they remove the animals so soon?
This lock's been sprung. Our thief is clever, using dummy cards to cover his tracks.
An extinct-animal trophy is worth a fortune to the crook who can fence it.
"All those poor little stuffed critters."
That's what he was after all along.
You're not telling me something.
Know what's wrong with our relationship?
You always let me get too close.
Excuse me. I have a date with a scratching post.
We don't have to make this difficult.
But somehow we always do.
Selina?
In here.
That's right, Penguin.
I got your bird just like I promised.
Of course, it'll cost you extra.
Hey, you don't want it, fine.
I can always use it for pillow stuffing.
See there? I knew you'd be reasonable.
While I got you on the horn, can I interest you in a Tasmanian tiger?
A steal at only 2 mil.
No, huh? That's okay.
I got a client dying to get her paws on it.
I thought I saw a pussycat.
Let go.
You know, I never had much use for animals, except Rhino here.
Thanks, boss.
Then it hit me, some rich geeks will pay big bucks for critters they can't...
...shoot no more. You know what these things are worth dead?
- More than my life, I bet.
- You win, kitten.
I needed a dummy to keep the cops busy while I grabbed the stiffs.
So you conned me into that phony jewel robbery.
Too bad for you, you figured it out.
Now we're gonna find out if there really is more than one way to skin a cat.
- Rhino.
- No!
Lousy fleabag.
Oh, great. Him, I don't need.
I don't know whether to bite you or kiss you.
Later.
Get me out of here.
Hurry.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Put me down.
- Sure.
Mr. ScarFace.
Let's let the chips fall where they may.
Get me off of here. Dummy, help me.
Help, help! Someone do something.
Please, let me save him.
Dummy, please.
That's one way to remove a splinter.
What's wrong, Ventriloquist?
Cat got your tongue?
Please, I never hurt you.
ScarFace, he's another person.
Not me, really.
But he's inside you somewhere.
And I'm going to keep scratching until I find him.
Don't make it harder on yourself.
- He cost me my freedom.
- No. You gave it up.
I suspected there was more to this business than you were telling.
So I put a transmitter on your cat back at your apartment.
It led me here in time to hear your confession.
- Why did you do it, Selina?
- I have to be who I am.
I realize now I can't change that.
Like I told someone else tonight...
...it's just the cat in me.
It's priceless, Batman. The last of its kind.
Will you take me in or let it become extinct again?
The lady or the tiger, darling.
Your choice.
I am the cat who walks by herself.

{692}{757}I know the tour's over,|but it's--
{759}{866}Last week in Spain, I really felt like|I was gonna have a nervous breakdown.
{868}{952}I couldn't take the crowds,|do the shows. It was too hot.
{953}{1019}Everything was getting to me.|And I thought...
{1021}{1130}I think I'm getting ready for|the depression for when the tour's over.
{1132}{1213}But I really didn't feel emotional|last night.
{1214}{1289}I know everybody else did...
{1291}{1394}but I didn't feel emotional because|it was like it already ended for me.
{1395}{1474}It's like when you know|someone's dying...
{1476}{1544}you have to make your peace|before they die.
{1546}{1635}I've done this with|close friends of mine.
{1637}{1720}I make my peace with it|before it happens...
{1722}{1780}so I don't get really hurt.
{1782}{1852}And then when it happens|it's like...
{1879}{1933}I don't feel anything.
{1935}{1995}But I know I'll feel|something later.
{1997}{2068}I just don't know|when that's gonna be.
{2099}{2172}I guess it's a protection device.
{2220}{2299}I hope I'm in a safe place|when it happens.
{2524}{2586}What's wrong with me?|I'm freaking out.
{2588}{2625}I have 'Japanitis.'
{2685}{2717}Let's walk.
{2914}{2982}Papa don't preach
{2984}{3049}Stop. Stop. Stop.
{3104}{3170}Keith, you motherfucker!
{3247}{3281}Hello.
{3314}{3396}The level up here|is not that loud...
{3398}{3460}and there's no reason|for all this feedback.
{3462}{3561}If we can't get it to sound better|than this, then I'm not doing a show.
{3563}{3667}Some someone who knows about sound|better come up here and explain it.
{3770}{3833}- I'm waiting.|- She's getting pissed.
{3835}{3942}Why can Donna and Niki|not hear themselves?
{4001}{4049}Where's John Draper?
{4076}{4142}She sees me and the smile is gone.
{4144}{4208}- It's because it's raining, Freddy!|- I know.
{4210}{4266}You think it's funny.
{4300}{4364}I don't think it's funny.
{4366}{4437}Get out. I'm having a business talk.
{4438}{4478}Good-bye.
{4545}{4631}Who does she think she is, my mama?|Snatching my head.
{4633}{4700}I only look white.
{4702}{4789}She's really Mabel. Remember|What's Happening? That's her.
{4791}{4862}I was born a poor black child.
{4864}{4904}No rhythm.
{4906}{4967}Look at her hair.|Fuckin' pickaninny lookin' shit.
{5042}{5127}I don't wanna do no makeup|on Madonna, master.
{5129}{5164}I got rhythm.
{5166}{5229}Do it the way it looks smooth.
{5231}{5284}Do you like it over your head?
{5286}{5369}No. The great thing is your hidden|and then you pop out.
{5371}{5450}That's why I asked you if I'm gonna|do it over your head or not?
{5491}{5608}I don't think so.|Take a poll. Ask everybody.
{5610}{5700}- Take a pole?|- Yeah, and ram it up your ass.
{5702}{5776}I'm just kidding.|I'm just kidding, Ollie.
{5778}{5820}No, you said it.
{5822}{5917}Every goddamn day, you throw|this little fag stuff on me.
{6015}{6122}- Don't you know what a poll is?|- Where is a pole? That's a pole.
{6123}{6239}A poll is when you go around|and take--
{6241}{6278}Did you say poll?
{6280}{6373}You're forgiven, Ollie. Everything you|don't know you're forgiven for.
{6375}{6448}Now let mama get her makeup done.
{6577}{6645}Oh, God. I love having children|to watch over.
{6681}{6765}You're not filming me getting an|adjustment. I won't be able to relax.
{6767}{6811}I'm serious.
{6812}{6885}Alec, no. No way.
{6887}{6935}We talked about this in L.A.
{6937}{7002}About me getting an adjustment.
{7032}{7093}Just tune it out.
{7094}{7166}Julie, shut up|and don't tell me to tune it out.
{7416}{7492}It's cold like|a New York winter day.
{7494}{7586}It's snowing weather,|that's what it's like.
{7588}{7662}All of you put black tights on.|Put the bowed costume on.
{7698}{7796}Put your jacket on, and that's|your costume for the night.
{7798}{7847}This is so wild.
{7849}{7943}I'm panicking right now.|Belgium stress.
{7944}{7992}Five minutes, everybody.
{7994}{8047}Show time.
{8111}{8177}Good evening.
{8179}{8268}I don't know about you,|but I'm freezing my ass off.
{8270}{8350}But we're gonna do|a good show for you anyway.
{8515}{8563}For some strange reason...
{8564}{8662}I failed to realize the first leg of the|tour was during Japan's rainy season.
{8664}{8753}So, for three straight weeks|we performed the show in a blizzard.
{8755}{8834}But the dancers are so excited to be|performing for an audience...
{8836}{8903}the world could blow up|and they wouldn't care.
{8905}{8992}I, on the other hand, was not|in the mood for Eskimos on ice.
{8994}{9063}The only thing that kept me|from slashing my wrists...
{9065}{9126}was the thought of coming back|to America...
{9127}{9180}and doing the show|the way it was meant to be.
{10353}{10397}All right, America!
{10424}{10506}Do you believe in love?
{10508}{10609}'Cause I got something to say about it|and it goes like this.
{10611}{10700}Don't go for second best, baby
{10702}{10758}Put your love to the test
{10760}{10811}You know you got to
{10813}{10900}Make him express how he feels
{10902}{10997}And, baby, then you know|your love is real
{11220}{11306}You don't need diamond rings
{11308}{11399}Or 18-karat gold
{11429}{11504}Fancy cars that go very fast
{11506}{11565}You know they never last
{11644}{11711}What you need is a big strong hand
{11713}{11804}To lift you to your higher ground
{11852}{11923}Make you feel like a queen|on a throne
{11925}{12019}Make him love you|till you can't come down
{12452}{12536}Long stem roses|are the way to your heart
{12538}{12632}But he needs|to start with your head
{12659}{12751}Satin sheets are very romantic
{12753}{12841}What happens|when you're not in bed
{12874}{12943}You deserve the best in life
{12944}{13041}So if the time isn't right|then move on
{13085}{13145}Second best is never enough
{13147}{13237}You'd do much better, baby|on your own
{13653}{13695}Express yourself
{13697}{13792}You've got to make him|express himself
{13866}{13929}So if you want it right now
{13931}{13988}Make him show you how
{13990}{14096}Express what he's got|Baby, ready or not
{14932}{15051}And when you're gone|he might regret it
{15053}{15123}Think about the love|he once had
{15125}{15256}You've got to carry on|but he just won't get it
{15258}{15331}He'll be back on his knees|so please
{16138}{16213}Express yourself
{16215}{16287}So you can respect yourself
{16669}{16782}By the time we left Japan,|I was getting attached to the dancers...
{16814}{16916}and I started feeling like|a mother to them.
{16918}{17023}Gabriel, since you never give me|attitude, you get the oldest one.
{17025}{17054}Thank you.
{17056}{17133}When we got to America,|I got to meet the mothers...
{17134}{17218}of all the children|I temporarily claimed as my own.
{17220}{17311}And the parents were usually|as colorful as their kids.
{17313}{17365}It's Mama Make-up.
{17367}{17429}- Is that it?|- Don't we look alike?
{17489}{17534}Happy Mother's Day.
{17602}{17693}Carlton's mom is in the hallway.|I just heard her.
{17834}{17886}- There she is.|- Hi.
{17888}{17964}I want one with her. I must.
{17990}{18049}She is so tiny and cute.
{18050}{18157}Ooh, baby|do you know what that's worth
{18159}{18256}Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
{18305}{18361}Do I have to listen to this?
{18362}{18447}That's why I want my radio on.|Those girls annoy me.
{18481}{18567}It's Donna imitating|Belinda Carlisle.
{18569}{18621}Niki's mommy is singing.
{18650}{18699}I know. I know.
{18761}{18805}That's the one.
{18884}{18949}You know it's a bad sign...
{18950}{19027}when they want you to go on|a half an hour early.
{19029}{19081}Everything's fine.
{19083}{19150}But we're in a conservative town.
{19185}{19280}And that is another reason|to not wanna live in Chicago.
{19282}{19364}Beside for the fact|that Oprah Winfrey lives here.
{19460}{19503}Do you want a T-shirt?
{19504}{19568}I think I have unconsciously...
{19570}{19680}chosen people that are|emotionally crippled in some way.
{19730}{19804}Or who need mothering in some way.|Because...
{19830}{19900}I think it comes natural to me.
{19901}{19990}It fulfills a need in me|to be mothered.
{19992}{20062}Wait a second. You guys.
{20064}{20124}Does Jose love me|more than I love him?
{20126}{20178}- It's not possible.|- Yes.
{20199}{20258}You know what it is?
{20260}{20323}After rehearsal in our hotel room...
{20325}{20374}and guess what this child pumped?
{20452}{20507}Get up off the floor.
{20535}{20583}Don't ever leave me.
{20634}{20722}The innocence of the dancers|move me.
{20724}{20804}They're not jaded in the least.|They haven't been anywhere.
{20806}{20900}This was the opportunity|of their lives.
{20902}{20988}And I know that they've suffered|a great deal in their lives...
{20990}{21081}whether with their families|or just being poor.
{21083}{21178}And I wanted to give them|the thrill of their lives.
{21179}{21249}I wanted to impress them.|I wanted to love them.
{21289}{21352}I'd like to leave a message.
{21354}{21470}Someone is coming. My father|is coming from New Orleans...
{21472}{21542}and he's gonna be here|in 20 minutes.
{21544}{21609}So when he comes,|could you please let him--
{21611}{21734}I haven't seen him in five years. This|is not important to you. I don't care.
{21736}{21820}Let him park in the front, please.
{21822}{21882}No valet. Just let him park.
{21883}{21940}I haven't seen him in a long time.
{22182}{22265}Now that I think about it,|I don't want to meet him.
{22266}{22315}I'm just joking.
{22416}{22471}I'm looking for|a black Cherokee Jeep.
{22645}{22705}Wait, hold up.|There's a Jeep leaving.
{22807}{22839}Bye, Daddy.
{23035}{23062}Hello.
{23129}{23190}Thank you.|He's on his way up.
{23306}{23355}Oh, my God.
{23475}{23511}How you doing?
{23513}{23604}When I saw him, I was disappointed|because we didn't look alike.
{23606}{23647}Not anymore.
{23648}{23726}When I saw him, it was like,|'This was my brother Lance.'
{23728}{23827}- When is your birthday?|- You acted just like Lance.
{23829}{23940}My God, Daddy, if you saw Lance,|you would trip. He acts just like you.
{23942}{24035}- Really?|- This is a trip.
{24037}{24096}I'm disappointed.|You can't meet Madonna now.
{24120}{24185}Ollie, are you okay?
{24223}{24271}What's wrong, baby?
{24294}{24345}Wait a minute.|How's your dad?
{24347}{24414}I believe you.
{24552}{24600}Please tell me--
{24602}{24642}- How was it?|- Yeah.
{24708}{24753}- Were you nervous?|- Oh, no.
{24755}{24825}- Is he coming to the show?|- Yeah.
{24827}{24876}Will you bring him backstage?
{24877}{24920}- After what?|- The show.
{24922}{24967}Bring him back to my room.
{24969}{25057}Now, the reason why I haven't|seen him in five years...
{25059}{25151}and talked to him much|is because he told me...
{25152}{25228}'Oliver, you're not gonna make it.|I wish you'd stop dancing.'
{25230}{25313}When he got to Houston,|we had a talk about this.
{25315}{25364}Then he asked me to forgive him...
{25365}{25449}which I never heard from him before.
{25451}{25503}And I forgave him.
{25593}{25658}I guess he felt happy.
{25957}{26025}Oh, Father
{26027}{26105}If you never wanted|to live that way
{26107}{26185}If you never wanted|to hurt me
{26187}{26254}Why am I running away
{26649}{26720}Maybe someday
{26722}{26776}When I look back
{26778}{26863}I'll be able to say
{26885}{26997}You didn't mean to be cruel
{26999}{27091}And somebody hurt you too
{27112}{27215}You can't hurt me now
{27240}{27319}I got away from you
{27320}{27386}I never thought I would
{27413}{27545}You can't make me cry
{27547}{27606}You once had the power
{27631}{27693}I never felt so good
{27695}{27803}About myself
{29106}{29138}- Hello?|- Dad?
{29140}{29178}- Yes!|- Hi, it's me.
{29180}{29244}- Hi. How are you?|- Listen.
{29284}{29408}I realize I haven't talked to you|in a while and I hope all is good.
{29410}{29541}But I have no idea what night|you guys are coming to the show.
{29543}{29629}And all that stuff.|So, what's going on?
{29631}{29678}Your nights were changed.
{29679}{29777}Who wants to come? And when?
{29779}{29822}Whatever--
{29864}{29938}I'd love it if you'd come|to both shows.
{29940}{30036}It's pretty racy. I don't know|if you could take it two nights.
{30038}{30091}You had to get racy on me?
{30092}{30158}Dad, I'm not getting racy.|I've been racy.
{30160}{30235}- Can't you tone it down a bit?|- For you?
{30237}{30314}That would be compromising|my artistic integrity.
{30316}{30414}Of course. Do you undress|in this performance?
{30416}{30489}No! Of course I don't.
{30535}{30586}Whatever you can get tickets for.
{30588}{30660}Dad, I can get you tickets|any night you wanna come.
{30662}{30755}- That would be great.|- How many tickets do you want?
{30757}{30823}But you gotta tell me now|and who they're for.
{30825}{30887}- Martin and a friend.|- How's Marty doing?
{30888}{30979}- We took him to--|- Did he go to the rehab center?
{30981}{31045}He's there.|He's getting out on the 25.
{31047}{31127}- The 25?|- The reason I called...
{31128}{31192}is he wanted to know|if he could do this?
{31194}{31238}Do what?
{31240}{31335}- He wants to have a party.|- Dad, I'll tell you something.
{31337}{31425}This is really grueling show|and tour.
{31427}{31535}It's not like when I played stadiums|where I do one show then have days off.
{31536}{31579}These are back-to-back.
{31581}{31684}I don't like to go out and party|because I lose my voice.
{31686}{31766}Halfway through 'Get lnto The Groove,'|the monitors went off on stage.
{31767}{31867}I cannot hear myself! And he's|standing there like he doesn't know.
{31869}{31964}I don't think I really anticipated|how draining the show was gonna be.
{31966}{32044}My brother Christopher warned me|I was gonna regret it.
{32046}{32130}But by the time I realized|he was right it was too late.
{32132}{32185}Definitely, one of|the all-time worst.
{32187}{32293}It wasn't just the physical aspect.|There were so many technical things.
{32295}{32385}So many little things that could|fuck up and, boy, did they.
{32670}{32727}Never want to turn your back
{32778}{32836}The monitors have|never done it before.
{32838}{32917}Something going on in the building|we didn't have at sound check.
{32919}{33034}I wanna check everywhere to make sure|this doesn't happen again...
{33036}{33087}'cause it happened in|'Where's the Party .'
{33089}{33177}You don't understand|there's no way of checking things--
{33179}{33233}How come it's not happening|to Niki and Donna?
{33235}{33325}I have no answer because there's|something close to your frequency--
{33327}{33379}If you don't find an answer--
{33410}{33485}I'm singing a cappella|and my headset goes out...
{33487}{33547}and everybody thinks the show|is over with.
{33548}{33612}How come it didn't happen|to the girls?
{33613}{33676}We're all on separate frequencies.
{33678}{33772}Put me on their fucking frequency.|And you know.
{33975}{34016}Motherfuck!
{34018}{34047}Ouch!
{34112}{34222}Somebody stuck some big fat man|up in the front to give me dirty looks.
{34223}{34272}I swear to God.
{34334}{34412}And don't hide back there, Warren.|Get over here.
{34414}{34466}- Freddy?|- Yes, ma'am?
{34468}{34523}- You lied.|- What did I lie about?
{34524}{34595}There was only industry people|in the first two rows.
{34597}{34681}- I didn't like that.|- You said there wasn't gonna be any.
{34683}{34784}- I don't how they got there.|- They totally bummed me out.
{34785}{34893}They sat there with their arms folded,|dirty looks on their faces.
{34895}{34981}I swear to God. Do something else.|Do my eyebrows.
{34983}{35071}It was so distracting|and so depressing to me...
{35073}{35176}to have two rows of people looking like|they weren't there to have fun.
{35178}{35258}- What's the point?|- Everyone in the pit was dancing.
{35260}{35357}Freddy, fuck you! There was not.
{35359}{35426}There were three rows of assholes|and then a space.
{35428}{35534}I tried to change it, and|I'm trying to change it for tomorrow.
{35536}{35588}I want it changed.|And John Draper.
{35590}{35675}- Hi.|- Please give Keith a new asshole...
{35677}{35802}because he's in charge|of my show, the sound of it.
{35804}{35897}- Are you talking about the very end?|- It wasn't the very end.
{35899}{35986}It was in 'Causing a Commotion'|and 'Open Your Heart'...
{35987}{36056}and 'Keep It Together'|and 'Where's The Party' and 'Vogue'...
{36058}{36121}my sound kept coming out|on my headset.
{36123}{36203}- Kept cutting out?|- Don't tell me you didn't know.
{36204}{36269}- In 'Keep It Together.'|- No. Yeah.
{36271}{36370}- You were particularly awesome.|- I thought it was killer.
{36371}{36424}Unbelievable.
{36425}{36465}- Thank you.|- Awesome.
{36467}{36550}- People could see it.|- See how good I am when I'm pissed off?
{36551}{36616}- If that's what it takes.|- No, please, Freddy.
{36618}{36699}I thought you were in the greatest mood|because you were really putting out.
{36701}{36754}- The crowd was--|- The crowd was tough.
{36756}{36825}It was a tough crowd on the sides|because it's L.A.
{36827}{36944}Look, everyone looked like a goddamn|William Morris agent in the first rows.
{36946}{37003}Okay, that's it, Freddy.
{37059}{37107}You stink.
{37109}{37178}You pussy, man.|Get over here.
{37210}{37252}What is with you?
{37254}{37336}Can you believe|I have to do this every night?
{37338}{37411}Are you gonna be|nicer to me now, Warren?
{37483}{37524}What?
{37864}{37897}Where are you going?
{37941}{38016}Bring some people back because|I have to go home and go to sleep.
{38075}{38164}Liz, you look|really well rested... not.
{38165}{38229}I'm trying to turn Warren|into a vegetarian.
{38267}{38350}I told him I wouldn't have his baby|unless he was a vegetarian.
{38352}{38381}Not!
{38517}{38614}- The lights are good here. Don't worry.|- It's good if you lie down.
{38616}{38688}- That's AI Pacino.|- Hi. Nice to meet you.
{38689}{38757}- That's Mandy Patinkin.|- How are you? Nice to meet you.
{38759}{38809}Los Angeles was hard that way.
{38811}{38898}I've found it weird for celebrities|to assume a friendship with you...
{38900}{38949}because you're a celebrity.
{38950}{39009}It can get kind of awkward.
{39011}{39075}Warren thanks you all for coming.
{39107}{39147}Hi.
{39149}{39194}- You were great.|- Thank you.
{39196}{39276}Thanks for having us.|It was really generous.
{39278}{39339}- Thanks for coming.|- We thought it was neat.
{39341}{39382}- 'Neat?'|- Really neat.
{39384}{39441}No one's ever described it as that.
{39443}{39519}Have fun. We won't be making|that other deal.
{39521}{39593}- Not neat enough for you.|- Not quite.
{39594}{39689}We've gotta get the kids.
{39690}{39739}And give them this.
{39764}{39835}- Thanks.|- God bless. Thanks.
{39943}{40032}Neat? Anybody who says my show|is 'neat' has to go.
{40055}{40102}He loves me.
{40104}{40152}He loves me not.
{40434}{40496}He just wants to fuck me.
{40498}{40550}He really cares about me.
{40761}{40803}- Uh-oh.|- What?
{40805}{40883}I ended on a 'He loves me not.'|Does this little one count?
{40885}{40952}- Not if you don't want it to.|- There's two there.
{40986}{41045}- There are not two.|- Make it not count.
{41047}{41131}It's one. He loves me all right.
{41133}{41220}Warren told me Edie Sedgewick|wanted to meet him.
{41249}{41330}He said, 'Okay,'|'cause he was curious...
{41332}{41411}as any red-blooded American male|would have been.
{41472}{41606}She came over, and he said she had|a completely see-through raincoat on...
{41608}{41670}and nothing on underneath it.
{41671}{41720}Isn't that funny?
{41748}{41801}He didn't fuck her.
{41803}{41852}Isn't that unusual?
{41884}{41975}- Do you really like them?|- What do you think People will say?
{42007}{42122}I remember when I told Warren|to bring me a present. He did.
{42124}{42229}He brought me this really cool|shirt from Dolce and Grebano.
{42231}{42292}See? I get what I want.
{42294}{42357}May I speak to Warren Beatty please?
{42461}{42534}He doesn't even have|a fake name.
{42585}{42692}Warren, you're supposed to be here.|It's 5:30.
{42694}{42796}If you don't get over here now,|I'm leaving without you.
{42825}{42906}I did too.|I never said that.
{42955}{43004}What an asshole!
{43176}{43214}Ow.
{43291}{43363}I had a dream last night...
{43365}{43444}that Gorbachev came to my show.
{43446}{43495}My first reaction was...
{43547}{43647}that Warren was gonna be so jealous|I got to meet him first.
{43679}{43747}Anyway, it was a good dream.
{44010}{44065}The police are here.
{44156}{44267}You can't do the masturbation scene|tonight or you'll be arrested.
{44268}{44310}- Really?|- Uh-huh.
{44312}{44375}Oh, good, let's see what happens.
{44377}{44460}- They will do it.|- What, jump on stage?
{44462}{44523}- They'll wait till after the show.|- They'll arrest you after.
{44524}{44583}- Are you guys serious?|- Totally serious.
{44585}{44634}Clay is down there with Freddy.
{44635}{44724}- So what's considered masturbation?|- Sticking your hand on your crotch.
{44726}{44818}But then another one of our options|is to cancel the show.
{44875}{44949}- If you choose that, we won't play.|- It's your choice.
{44951}{45071}We're asking for that, and it's|your choice. It's in your hands.
{45073}{45154}- We'll have to pay a fine?|- We'll have to cancel the show.
{45156}{45214}They'll probably take you|to the station.
{45216}{45300}Write you a ticket. You'll pay for it.|You'd be in every paper.
{45302}{45375}Yeah! I'm not changing|my fucking show.
{45377}{45508}I think I need some legal advice|from a Canadian attorney...
{45509}{45558}before I make a decision.
{45586}{45645}- You're lying.|- I am not lying.
{45647}{45749}I swear to God. The police and a|representative from the D.A.'s office.
{45751}{45827}Two plain clothes policemen|saw the show.
{45829}{45866}- Really?|- Yesterday.
{45868}{45949}- And they said--|- Immoral live performance.
{46037}{46095}You shouldn't have told me.
{46097}{46168}It might prepare you for this|with the police standing there.
{46170}{46196}Did you guys hear?
{46198}{46255}- What?|- That the police are here.
{46257}{46333}-Why?|-If I touch my crotch, I'll be arrested.
{46334}{46372}Are you serious?
{46439}{46516}They arrested Bobby Brown|for fucking on stage.
{46518}{46594}- That's called jealousy.|- I hope he's in jail when I get there.
{46596}{46660}My question is|does it help legally--
{46662}{46737}Strictly as a legal question,|if we go on stage...
{46739}{46821}and someone says, 'This show|may contain graphic material--'
{46822}{46877}Doesn't work. Not here.
{46879}{46937}We are going to jail.|I'm so excited.
{46938}{46997}Dear Lord...
{46998}{47057}this is our last night|in Toronto...
{47059}{47131}the fascist state of Toronto.
{47133}{47246}All my babies are feeling fragile,|and I want you all to know...
{47248}{47330}I love you all and I appreciate|everything you're doing for me...
{47332}{47375}and I'm here if you need me.
{47377}{47482}I want you to go out there tonight|and give everything you have.
{47484}{47571}Have a great show. Remember,|in the United States of America...
{47573}{47633}there is freedom of speech.
{47699}{47748}And let's kick ass.
{47809}{47872}Are we gonna go to jail or what?
{47874}{47947}I ain't changing my show.
{47949}{48009}I'll give you the options.
{48011}{48073}They just told me that|there's been complaints...
{48075}{48148}that there are simulated orgasms,|blah, blah, blah.
{48150}{48240}It's against their rules|and regulations.
{48242}{48291}I am not changing my show.
{48293}{48372}I know you're not, but can you wait five|minutes for me to straighten it out?
{48374}{48478}- What's to straighten out?|- Hopefully we can change their mind.
{48480}{48572}All you have to do is tell them|I'm not changing my show.
{48573}{48669}I am an artist and this is how I express|myself. What do you have to tell them?
{48802}{48890}We shall overcome
{48988}{49114}She has told me that this is|artistic freedom. This is her show.
{49116}{49244}It's gone in several countries|in major cities across the world.
{49246}{49342}In Canada, if you choose|to do that...
{49344}{49411}I'm sure it will be|an international scandal.
{49515}{49608}God, everything's gonna have|a whole new meaning in the show.
{49609}{49714}Like when I say 'God,' I'll be praying|that I don't get arrested.
{49765}{49814}Where else am I nasty?
{49815}{49864}Everywhere.
{49866}{49936}We're gonna realize tonight|how many places we do this.
{49938}{50059}Say, 'Toronto, you believe in freedom?|I got something to say about it.'
{50061}{50126}- Chris, don't let them take me.|- They won't.
{50127}{50188}Celebration
{50190}{50222}Come together
{50223}{50288}In every nation
{50290}{50348}- That's right.|- Holiday
{50543}{50580}Get arrested for that.
{50581}{50668}Consequences is they may detain her|after the show...
{50670}{50725}and charge her with indecency.
{50726}{50812}Last time I was on tour,|Sean was in jail. I guess it's my turn.
{50862}{50921}She'll do it, but she won't--
{50922}{50979}Bet she does it more.
{51020}{51093}- How much you wanna bet?|- I'll bet something small.
{51094}{51143}I'll trust you.
{52062}{52181}I made it through the wilderness
{52183}{52279}Somehow I made it through
{52345}{52431}Didn't know how lost I was
{52433}{52500}Until I found you
{52549}{52612}I was beat
{52614}{52653}Incomplete
{52677}{52731}I'd been had
{52733}{52802}I was sad and blue
{52803}{52891}But you made me feel
{52933}{53031}Yeah, you made me feel
{53033}{53114}Shiny and new
{53166}{53241}Like a virgin
{53288}{53381}Touched for the very first time
{53427}{53519}Like a virgin
{53557}{53628}When your heart beats
{53630}{53664}Next to mine
{53666}{53753}Gonna give you all my love, boy
{53793}{53893}My fear is fading fast
{53955}{54033}Been saving it all for you
{54035}{54120}'Cause only love can last
{54161}{54210}You're so fine
{54227}{54265}And you're mine
{54290}{54346}Make me strong
{54347}{54414}Yeah, you make me bold
{54416}{54496}'Cause your love thawed out
{54543}{54632}Yeah, your love thawed out
{54634}{54729}What was scared and cold
{56272}{56328}You're so fine
{56329}{56393}And you're mine
{56395}{56452}I'll be yours
{56454}{56522}Till the end of time
{56524}{56601}'Cause you made me feel
{56642}{56732}Yeah, you made me feel
{56751}{56837}I'd nothing to hide
{57597}{57665}Feels so good inside
{57706}{57748}When you hold me
{57771}{57817}And your heart beats
{57838}{57883}And you love me
{58641}{58717}Spokesman for rock singer Madonna|say Metro police...
{58719}{58807}and Crown Attorney's office threatened|to arrest the star last night...
{58809}{58863}for lewd and obscene behavior.
{58865}{58954}However, the police department tonight|has a different story.
{58956}{59060}Headquarters said officers checked out|the show on complaints...
{59062}{59130}found nothing wrong|and left without incident.
{59131}{59192}Madonna released a statement|from Michigan saying...
{59194}{59276}she would rather cancel the show|than alter it.
{59277}{59408}Detroit was definitely the hardest|place we went to on the tour...
{59410}{59464}at an emotional level.
{59505}{59560}God, going home is--
{59562}{59630}Well, it's just never|that easy for me.
{59632}{59747}People always talk about|how stardom changes you...
{59749}{59810}but they never talk about how it can|change the people close to you.
{59812}{59835}Hi, Marty.
{59837}{59893}- Who is that?|- How you doin'?
{59895}{59943}How's it going?
{60015}{60084}- This is my brother Martin.|- Hi, Marty.
{60086}{60161}This is Donna.|Don't pay any attention to her.
{60200}{60294}- Niki, you gonna say hi to Marty?|- Hi, Marty.
{60296}{60365}I feel that there is a pressure.
{60367}{60424}Because of my sister people say...
{60426}{60499}'How come you're not that?|How come you're not the manager?
{60501}{60604}How come you're not this,|the other?
{60605}{60660}You should be this, that.
{60662}{60723}There is something|they measure against you.
{60725}{60778}And sometimes I cop an attitude.
{60780}{60837}But I deal with it.
{60896}{60960}Well, she's available.
{60962}{61041}Why don't you talk to her?|She's taking a nap now.
{61043}{61150}I'm gonna be back here probably|around 7:00.
{61152}{61232}I can't see anybody|till after the show.
{61283}{61338}Sounds good. See ya, hon.
{61339}{61423}We're tight. We talk and stuff.
{61425}{61495}She gives me advice|and I give her a few tips...
{61496}{61549}and she gives me a few tips.
{61551}{61634}We really have|a give-and-take relationship.
{61662}{61715}We can get past that star bullshit.
{61717}{61767}She knows what time|it is with me...
{61769}{61818}and I know what time|it is with her.
{61820}{61902}Dear Lord, it seems like every time|I'm standing here before the show...
{61903}{61999}I'm asking for something extra special,|but I'm here again.
{62001}{62060}They say, 'Ask and you shall receive.'
{62062}{62168}So, I'm begging You to give me|a voice to sing with this evening...
{62169}{62205}and the girls too.
{62207}{62308}This is my hometown,|so I'm extra nervous.
{62310}{62390}And even though|it's not supposed to matter...
{62392}{62457}it does matter what they think.
{62459}{62548}And so I ask You...
{62550}{62602}to give me...
{62604}{62671}that little extra something special...
{62672}{62758}to show everybody here|that I did...
{62759}{62824}make something out of my life, amen.
{62826}{62874}Have a great show.
{63011}{63088}I said it last night,|and I'll say it again.
{63090}{63143}There's no place like home.
{63315}{63376}In addition to that...
{63378}{63475}there's nobody like this man.
{63477}{63572}There's nobody like my father...
{63574}{63634}who is here tonight.
{63636}{63724}And I worship the ground|that he walks on.
{63726}{63805}And it's his birthday tonight.
{63807}{63917}I was wondering if I could sing 'Happy|Birthday' in front of 20,000 people?
{64161}{64210}This is my dad.
{64388}{64481}I was wondering if|you would all sing it with me.
{64543}{64591}Ready?
{64593}{64668}Happy birthday to you
{64762}{64789}I can't hear you.
{64805}{64879}Happy birthday
{64881}{64956}Dear Dad
{64958}{65036}Happy birthday
{65038}{65126}To you
{65346}{65409}Dad, I love you.
{65411}{65484}Detroit, I love you.|Good night.
{65519}{65567}Thank you.
{65720}{65778}So, did my father disown me?
{65816}{65861}- He looked so happy.|- Really?
{65862}{65943}Oh, God, I was so afraid|to do 'Like A Virgin.'
{65945}{66011}- I could tell you were.|- I was like--
{66082}{66131}Okay, I'm done with that now.
{66196}{66288}Oh, my God. It was harder|to do that show...
{66290}{66356}than the police in Toronto.
{66358}{66446}I was more afraid of what|my actions would result in.
{66480}{66533}Are you ready for Dad?
{66535}{66613}Dad, you can come in,|but I gotta get dressed. Come in.
{66615}{66693}Hi. I better take off|my sweaty clothes.
{66752}{66815}- You're soaking.|- Sorry.
{66817}{66882}Let me change.|Did you like the show?
{66884}{66969}- It was great.|- It was very good. Wonderful.
{66971}{67045}A little touchy in spots,|but it was great.
{67265}{67318}I didn't expect 'Happy Birthday.'
{67320}{67422}Oh, man. I tried not to start|bawling in front of everybody.
{67527}{67576}It's hard to sing and cry.
{67577}{67633}Now you know why I'm wiped out.
{67635}{67747}It's exhausting just watching|everything that's going on around.
{67809}{67864}I can't do this|for another two months.
{67866}{67921}I'm sure you're relieved it's over.
{67923}{68001}That one's over.|That was a big one.
{68003}{68047}I'm so tired.
{68049}{68181}The minute you turn your head,|the stuff is all lit on the stage.
{68238}{68314}Hi. I'm getting a touch-up.
{68316}{68359}You take a shower already?
{68421}{68515}I never thought I'd see you|bow at your father's foot.
{68517}{68597}- I thought that was great.|- I never thought I would either.
{68598}{68694}I was honored.|A little taken back, but honored.
{68696}{68789}I thought I had to make up since|I didn't get you a birthday present.
{68816}{68887}Weren't the sets beautiful?|Didn't Chris do a great job?
{68889}{68951}Aren't my dancers great?
{68953}{69048}It was all great.|Some scenes there were...
{69050}{69097}- X-rated?|- burlesque.
{69099}{69195}Dad. You don't understand.|They all lead to something.
{69196}{69277}- Art.|- It's got nothing to do with art.
{69279}{69369}It's a journey that you go on.
{69371}{69434}You get on this train,|you have to stay on to the end.
{69436}{69512}Exactly. You take a journey.|It's cathartic.
{69513}{69598}You can't get to one place|without going to another place.
{69651}{69703}It's like growing up.
{69705}{69765}That's what my show is like.
{69767}{69815}She's growing up on stage.
{69865}{69913}My brother's gonna come.
{69915}{69992}If he has a few friends,|that's fine.
{69994}{70062}But if he brings a lot of people...
{70064}{70137}then I want you|to come in here...
{70139}{70191}and be the chaperon...
{70193}{70253}because my brother's crazy.
{70255}{70333}- I know.|- You have to be nice too.
{70335}{70401}He can't help it.
{70403}{70451}Thank you.
{70489}{70584}What's my fart poem?|Should I say it?
{70586}{70661}Which one?|The one about the beans?
{70758}{70821}I'm replenishing my fluids.
{70823}{70889}A fart is a chemical substance.
{70891}{70951}It comes from a place|called Bum.
{70952}{71024}It penetrates through the trousers...
{71058}{71118}and lands with a musical hum.
{71120}{71174}To fart is no disgrace...
{71176}{71224}for it gives the body ease.
{71226}{71338}It warms the blankets on cold winter|nights and suffocates the fleas.
{71427}{71500}And. Angie said...
{71531}{71591}'You're not gonna stay|and see Marty?'
{71593}{71642}Don't leave me alone.
{71673}{71743}- I'll be here in spirit.|- Bastard.
{71745}{71827}We went out to get the limousine|and the driver was gone...
{71829}{71918}because the guy who owned the service|locked his keys in his car.
{71920}{71950}So I had to wait.
{71952}{72050}He probably stopped at a bar|for 12 drinks.
{72116}{72169}No, he didn't.|He's cleaned up.
{72171}{72216}Oh, yeah.
{72252}{72344}Dad says he went to alcohol rehab|to escape going to jail.
{72346}{72410}'He went there|for the wrong reasons.
{72412}{72524}It wasn't proper motivation.|He doesn't wanna heal himself.
{72565}{72613}Did Martin come yet?
{72615}{72662}Did he show up yet?
{72692}{72744}Oh, well. Thanks.
{72837}{72887}Martin was supposed to come...
{72889}{72936}but he didn't.
{72938}{72986}Big deal.
{73057}{73158}I think Martin's not coming.|I'm going to bed.
{73160}{73208}C.
{73210}{73285}If my brother comes,|you just tell him...
{73287}{73360}that I'd like privacy, please.
{73472}{73532}- Hi, Martin.|- How you doing?
{73534}{73643}- Listen to that low voice.|- I made it lower for you.
{73644}{73726}- You been crying?|- My Visine.
{73763}{73823}My eyes got sore.|Where are you going?
{73824}{73900}- Have a drink with my family.|- You coming back up?
{73902}{73953}- I'll be back up.|- Where's she at?
{73955}{74015}She's probably sleeping.|Most likely.
{74073}{74123}401 I got to find.
{74125}{74192}I'll be right back.
{74194}{74241}- What are you looking for?|- 401.
{74243}{74314}- It's right there.|- It's right here?
{74343}{74411}It was right in front of me|the whole time.
{75142}{75204}She's probably sleeping.
{75243}{75291}Good night.
{75494}{75587}Sharon, I beat up girls like you|when I was little.
{75646}{75707}It's true. You know who|she reminds me of?
{75709}{75769}- Who?|- Of the McFarlands.
{75797}{75848}Maureen McFarland.
{75952}{76004}- Hello. Hi.|- Are you Maureen?
{76048}{76086}You guys.
{76088}{76202}They're a nice family.|If you think our family's wacky.
{76204}{76256}I won't say anymore.
{76258}{76350}There was a time about ten years ago|that I was in Colorado...
{76352}{76447}and I was gonna go to New York|to see her 'cause she was there...
{76449}{76536}and I never made it.
{76538}{76646}I was a dancer on the road.|Different kind. I was topless.
{76648}{76697}I was really into drugs.
{76699}{76796}But Moira McFarland taught me|how to shave my legs.
{76836}{76906}Let me borrow her stuffed bra.
{76908}{76980}- How old were you?|- Showed me how to use Tampons.
{76982}{77063}Not very well, I might add.|And taught me how to make out.
{77065}{77166}Madonna, I did not teach you|how to insert a Tampon.
{77168}{77299}And if we got in bed together naked,|I don't remember that.
{77301}{77408}She said she was never in bed|naked with me? She's a liar.
{77410}{77471}She's got an active imagination.
{77472}{77529}She's a liar.|Did she say she finger-fucked me?
{77559}{77654}I remember looking at her bush.|I know.
{77656}{77772}See what happens when you take drugs|and alcohol. I lose a lot of stuff.
{77773}{77889}I remember the crack in her parent's|bed because it was two beds together.
{77891}{77949}I remember I fell through the crack.
{77951}{78028}We were naked jumping up and down|on the bed too much.
{78030}{78120}The last time|I really saw her before...
{78158}{78240}before she became a star...
{78242}{78291}was when I was in tenth grade.
{78293}{78350}Where's my idol?
{78412}{78462}I don't know if I'm nervous.
{78464}{78525}I just wanna see Madonna.
{78571}{78648}- You didn't recognize me?|- I didn't know you were coming out.
{78650}{78725}- I don't have my glasses on.|- So, how are you?
{78727}{78806}When you see the show, you'll forgive|me for not talking to you.
{78808}{78858}It's really difficult.
{78859}{78944}I know. I got five boys.
{78945}{79023}I gotta ask you something.|Can we sit down?
{79025}{79096}I can't sit down. I'm sorry.|What's up?
{79098}{79210}About four years ago,|I wrote you a letter.
{79212}{79346}You never received it. I asked you|if you would be Mario's godmother.
{79347}{79422}- I remember that.|- Did you read it?
{79423}{79499}I got it a long time|after the fact.
{79501}{79568}Well, very unexpectedly.
{79569}{79634}Real unexpectedly,|I'm pregnant again.
{79636}{79705}Really? Oh, my God.
{79779}{79868}I want you to be|the baby's godmother.
{79870}{79909}- Really?|- I really do.
{79911}{80016}You're coming tonight?|And Melissa has all your phone numbers?
{80018}{80107}- This is too rushed.|- I know.
{80109}{80196}I'm really flattered that you're asking|me, but I have to think about it.
{80243}{80328}- But that's really sweet.|- It's nothing to do with religion.
{80330}{80389}- I know.|- It's spirituality.
{80391}{80466}Do I get to decide on the name?
{80468}{80592}As long as it's the same as yours.|Except you've got to bless this child.
{80594}{80685}-Bless this and say, 'She needs a girl.'|-I would bless it anyways.
{80687}{80735}Have a girl, Moira.
{80788}{80871}I gotta go. Come out a girl|and we're gonna call you Madonna.
{80873}{80940}- All right, gimme a kiss and hug.|- I love you.
{80942}{81008}- I hope you like the show.|- I have something for you.
{81010}{81056}Is that the painting?
{81058}{81138}I'm gonna put it in my room.|Clay, come on.
{81140}{81193}I love this painting.
{81195}{81247}Thank you.
{81249}{81334}Thanks. I'm gonna put it|in my room. I love you too.
{81336}{81419}- And you call me after the tour.|- I will.
{81420}{81482}- Promise?|- I promise. Bye.
{81484}{81559}- I love you, Madonna.|- I love you too.
{81585}{81635}You little shit.
{81637}{81746}Look. Moira made|this painting for me.
{81748}{81816}- She did it herself?|- She did.
{81818}{81910}It's a Madonna and Child,|no pun intended.
{81933}{81985}It's not bad, really.
{82203}{82253}That's me breast-feeding.
{82255}{82304}Yeah, I got that.
{82340}{82415}Did you hear me dedicate|a song to her?
{82417}{82464}- I didn't hear that.|- I did.
{82466}{82519}In 'Where's the Party.'
{82521}{82633}I said, 'This one's for Moira,|my childhood idol.'
{82635}{82731}I remember praying to Madonna,|to her mother Madonna.
{82733}{82783}It was the closest thing to God.
{82984}{83081}When her mom died,|I was a little girl and I couldn't--
{83083}{83149}I remember feeling...
{83151}{83210}really sad and...
{83212}{83261}really awful.
{83332}{83395}But I don't know that anybody went--
{83397}{83501}I don't remember hugging Madonna|and telling her I'm sorry...
{83503}{83552}'cause I didn't understand.
{83553}{83602}I was seven and she was five.
{83603}{83682}So I just wanted to go back|and hug her.
{83811}{83874}Little girl
{83876}{83976}Don't you forget her face
{83978}{84080}Laughing away your tears
{84082}{84216}When she was the one|who felt all the pain
{84285}{84343}Little girl
{84345}{84448}Never forget her eyes
{84450}{84547}Keep them alive inside
{84548}{84623}I promise to try
{84650}{84744}But it's not the same
{84785}{84876}I hadn't been to the cemetery|since I was a young girl.
{84878}{84940}We used to go|right after she died.
{84942}{85053}My mother's death was a big mystery|to me when I was a child.
{85055}{85113}And no one really explained it.
{85163}{85234}What I remember most about her...
{85236}{85292}was that she was--
{85294}{85395}She was very kind and very gentle|and very feminine.
{85397}{85463}I guess she seemed|like an angel to me...
{85465}{85570}but I suppose everybody thinks their|mother's an angel when they're five.
{85572}{85653}I also know|she was really religious...
{85655}{85774}so I never really understood why|she was taken away from us.
{85776}{85831}It seemed so unfair.
{85833}{85903}I never thought that she|had done something wrong...
{85905}{85978}so oftentimes I wondered|what I had done wrong.
{85980}{86068}Does she hear my voice
{86070}{86122}In the night when I call
{86124}{86180}Wipe away all your tears
{86182}{86288}It's gonna be all right
{86450}{86552}I fought to be so strong
{86554}{86607}I guess you knew
{86609}{86675}I was afraid
{86708}{86786}You'd go away too
{86898}{86965}I wonder what she looks like now.
{86997}{87053}Just a bunch of dust.
{87131}{87182}I'm going to fit in right here.
{87184}{87248}They're gonna bury me sideways.
{87402}{87500}You've got to forget the past
{87501}{87590}And learn to forgive me
{87592}{87681}I promise to try
{87712}{87785}But feels like a lie
{87835}{87914}Don't let memory
{87916}{87989}Play games with your mind
{88049}{88145}She's a faded smile
{88147}{88191}Frozen in time
{88193}{88234}I'm still hangin' on
{88236}{88322}But I'm doin' it wrong
{88360}{88413}I don't want to stay here anymore.
{88444}{88540}Can't kiss her good-bye
{88563}{88675}But I promise to try
{88834}{88895}This is a show...
{88897}{88969}that I have no idea|what is gonna happen to my voice.
{88970}{89075}I don't know where it's gonna|come from, but give me a voice...
{89077}{89142}and let me put on|a great show tonight.
{89144}{89228}And let everybody do the same, amen.
{89230}{89292}It's like a dream
{89332}{89421}No end and no beginning
{89446}{89494}You're here with me
{89577}{89645}Let the choir sing
{89647}{89696}Stand back, please.
{89822}{89869}Now say--
{89917}{89953}Breathe.
{90075}{90108}Good.
{90436}{90473}Great. Take a breath.
{90502}{90553}- Good.|- This is crazy.
{90555}{90640}- Nobody talks about this on film?|- Talks about what?
{90641}{90725}The insanity of doing this|all on a documentary.
{90727}{90816}- Why?|- This is a serious matter, your throat.
{90846}{90913}Why should I stop here?
{90915}{90991}- But does anyone say it?|- Who's 'anyone'?
{90992}{91066}Anyone that comes|into this insane atmosphere.
{91068}{91153}You realize they feel it|when they come into this atmosphere.
{91154}{91254}When they come to wherever you are,|they feel crazy.
{91256}{91355}- Now, do they talk about it?|- No. They accept it.
{91357}{91426}- Why don't they talk about it?|- 'Cause.
{91428}{91501}- You want to think about that.|- No, I don't.
{91503}{91567}Let's get back to my throat.
{91633}{91730}Do you want to talk at all|off camera?
{91757}{91855}She doesn't want to live off camera,|much less talk.
{91892}{91940}There's nothing to say off camera.
{91942}{92010}Why would you say something|if it's off camera?
{92012}{92085}What point is there, existing?
{92118}{92191}Eventually, I had to admit|that I was a human being...
{92193}{92252}and agreed to cancel some shows.
{92254}{92290}What did she say?
{92291}{92378}I was told by the doctor|that I couldn't speak...
{92380}{92483}and I had to write|everything down on paper.
{92511}{92579}Melissa, my assistant, became...
{92581}{92646}my only link|to the outside world.
{92648}{92732}In a lot of ways, New York|and the time I spent there...
{92734}{92803}while I was sick|was the hardest on her.
{92805}{92872}Since I was staying in my apartment|in New York...
{92874}{92923}I lost contact with the dancers.
{92924}{93013}I had to give|all my messages to Melissa.
{93014}{93121}Through Melissa I heard they were|finding a lot to keep themselves busy.
{93123}{93214}I guess I was a little jealous|their lives were going on without me.
{93215}{93301}Donna Delory,|Madonna's backup singer...
{93303}{93363}also dancer on the tour.
{93365}{93434}- Donna, good to have you with us.|- It's great to be here.
{93436}{93520}Who choreographed|that 'Like A Virgin' number?
{93522}{93566}Who do you think?
{93568}{93608}Warren Beatty.
{93637}{93685}So, Warren.
{93687}{93771}You know, Donna,|I was reading the radio bible...
{93773}{93846}which I happen|to have a copy of here.
{93848}{93907}That thing is so wrong.
{93909}{93975}Let me read this first,|then you can comment.
{93977}{94036}'Madonna Dumps Beatty|For a Black Dancer.'
{94038}{94108}It talks about Slam.
{94110}{94216}'Madonna Swaps Beatty|For Dancer 31 Years Younger.'
{94218}{94285}First of all,|that guy's name is Oliver.
{94287}{94371}These guys are so wrong,|they didn't get the name right.
{94372}{94447}This is my first time|ever working with fags.
{94449}{94533}I'm the only straight guy,|and it's six of them.
{94534}{94615}We're here. We're queer.|Get used to it.
{94808}{94884}Oh, my God.|You know what else I hate?
{94886}{94950}Have you ever seen...
{94952}{95016}Luis walk in just underwear...
{95018}{95060}in front of|a whole bunch of people?
{95062}{95164}Just walk around in bikini,|just underwear.
{95166}{95236}Don't have no respect|for these people.
{95238}{95337}We know that he's a fag, or gay,|or whatever you want to call it...
{95339}{95392}but you don't have|to show it to everybody.
{95393}{95463}- We know you're happy.|- Hi, boys.
{95464}{95569}We know you're glad to be it,|but you don't have to show it...
{95571}{95644}Iet everybody know|that you're a fag.
{95645}{95692}Work, girl!
{95694}{95775}It was scary. It really was.
{95776}{95825}They wanted me.
{95826}{95931}And their thing was:|On this tour, we're gonna get him.
{95932}{95982}That's what they told me.
{96714}{96791}When the show started up again,|everything felt different.
{96793}{96861}There was so much tension.|I blamed myself.
{96863}{96938}I felt like a mother|who'd deserted her kids...
{96939}{97033}then comes back home to realize|how much trouble they've gotten into.
{97035}{97087}Don't touch my man, okay?
{97089}{97152}If you're going with that property,|you're wrong, baby.
{97154}{97284}'Madonna Swaps Beatty|For Dancer 31 Years Younger.
{97285}{97374}Madonna has dumped her lover,|Warren Beatty, for a young dancer...
{97375}{97469}with the body of a Greek god|and the stamina of a super stud.
{97567}{97652}The new love in her life|is 22-year-old Oliver Crumes...
{97654}{97704}also known as Slam.
{97777}{97836}I just want to tell you that...
{97838}{97929}I don't think you're guilty|for that thing in the magazine.
{97931}{97986}I'm not worried|about the magazine.
{97988}{98044}Oliver, look.
{98046}{98124}There are always going|to be queens on the rag.
{98126}{98188}You have to expect that of me.
{98190}{98261}You got some press,|and they're jealous.
{98263}{98330}'The fact that he's black|means nothing to Madonna.
{98331}{98396}She's attracted to him,|body and heart.
{98398}{98453}But not mind.
{98455}{98551}All that matters|is your relationship with me...
{98552}{98633}and not what you do|onstage every night.
{98635}{98685}I think it's silly.
{98687}{98756}- You know it's all bullshit.|- I know.
{98758}{98815}Then why let it bother you?
{98817}{98880}I'm not letting|them guys bother me.
{98882}{98952}A lot of crazy shit|is happening right now.
{98954}{99085}Everybody's gonna have to get over|their ego and pull this group together.
{99086}{99167}Please try to rise above it, okay?
{99169}{99246}Don't let it get to you.|All right?
{99300}{99392}And please don't give me attitude,|because I won't tolerate it.
{99441}{99487}Is that it?
{99518}{99598}I understand.|I'm just asking, is that it?
{99638}{99684}Yeah, that's it.
{99724}{99780}'During auditions for|her Blond Ambition tour...
{99782}{99839}she flirted with him openly|from day one.
{99841}{99919}He wasn't the best of the hundreds|of dancers auditioning.
{99921}{99983}- That's right.|- You can say that again.
{99985}{100026}Sometimes I think...
{100028}{100090}'Oliver, can you really dance?|Should you be on this tour?'
{100092}{100178}That's the way I feel sometimes,|and it's not good.
{100180}{100222}It gets to me.
{100224}{100288}Listen, you guys,|I just want to reiterate...
{100290}{100356}this thing about Oliver|and stuff.
{100358}{100428}Please don't pick on him.|I'm not protecting him.
{100430}{100508}To tell you the truth, I haven't|said a word to him since I got here.
{100509}{100570}But he's gone.|I don't know where he is.
{100572}{100657}He's hiding. You three together|can be pretty ferocious.
{100659}{100707}So be nice to him.
{100709}{100780}He doesn't have|the thick skin that you have.
{100782}{100869}He doesn't have the survival|techniques you guys have.
{100871}{100947}And I want him to perform|in the show.
{100981}{101026}- Thank you.|- No problem.
{101027}{101097}I don't believe that you|don't remember things like that.
{101099}{101157}How could Sharon not know|what happened to her?
{101158}{101207}She thinks someone drugged her.
{101208}{101269}She said she was|at the club dancing.
{101271}{101328}The next thing she knew|was that she woke up...
{101329}{101402}in her room, nude,|and her stuff was stolen.
{101404}{101458}She went to the bathroom.|Her butt was bleeding.
{101488}{101553}I'm sorry I'm laughing.|It's so--
{101555}{101596}That's all she remembers.
{101598}{101663}She said she wasn't drinking.|She had cranberry juice.
{101665}{101703}That's all she had.
{101705}{101751}They drugged her ass.
{101753}{101809}All I can think of is|that she started talking about...
{101811}{101892}how she's on tour with me,|she's staying at the Ritz Carlton...
{101894}{102002}and those guys got it in their mind|they were going to fuck with her.
{102003}{102078}I never thought that something|like that would happen to me.
{102080}{102162}I was fine. I was normal.|I was with the--
{102164}{102230}Most victims do.|They never thought--
{102232}{102308}I never thought something like that|would happen to me.
{102310}{102385}It was a nice club.|It was really nice.
{102386}{102454}I was just dancing|with these boys.
{102456}{102520}We were just like--|Like this, and--
{102522}{102566}I was totally sober.
{102567}{102641}You can ask my friend|and these other girls I saw.
{102642}{102692}Then the next thing I know--
{102739}{102791}I wake up this morning--
{102793}{102875}I ain't never gonna go out|by myself again.
{102877}{102981}Never going out by myself again.|I'm going to stick with you guys.
{103009}{103059}It was days like that...
{103061}{103170}that I was reminded just how young|the dancers really were.
{103172}{103260}What was really strange|was that this last show in New York...
{103262}{103356}was an AIDS benefit|in memory of a friend of mine...
{103358}{103434}a really good friend of mine...
{103436}{103477}who had died--
{103479}{103545}Here I was,|getting ready to go onstage...
{103547}{103641}to supposedly convince and inspire|thousands of people...
{103643}{103738}to get unified|and to fight the prejudice...
{103740}{103776}you know, that--
{103831}{103885}I couldn't even inspire|seven dancers.
{103887}{103942}All right.
{103944}{104015}I think everybody's feeling|a lot better...
{104017}{104082}today than they were|a couple of days ago.
{104084}{104133}I'm not worried about the show.
{104135}{104222}What I am worried about|and want to say a prayer about...
{104224}{104294}is the way people|have been behaving.
{104296}{104375}I don't care what you did|with your life before this tour.
{104377}{104438}I don't care what you do|with them afterwards.
{104440}{104522}But while you're working with me|and doing this show...
{104523}{104583}you will treat everyone|in this group...
{104584}{104670}with kindness, compassion|and respect.
{104672}{104774}I don't want to hear about it anymore.|There's too much pain in the world.
{104776}{104869}I want you to treat yourselves|with kindness and respect.
{104896}{104961}A lot of crazy shit|has been happening.
{104963}{105058}We have to start|looking out for each other.
{105060}{105136}And we have to start loving ourselves|a little bit more...
{105138}{105222}and loving the person|standing next to us a little bit more.
{105224}{105315}Seeing how this is our last show|in New York...
{105317}{105365}and our last show...
{105407}{105473}in the United States...
{105475}{105545}and we are dedicating it|to Keith Haring...
{105547}{105663}who doesn't have the luxury|of being alive, like we do...
{105665}{105718}I beg You...
{105720}{105827}to let me and everybody in this room|rise above all of our problems...
{105829}{105918}and go out there|on that stage tonight...
{105920}{105991}and give the best performance|of our lives.
{105992}{106041}Do this one for Keith.
{106092}{106128}Amen.
{106182}{106253}That's all.|Everybody, have a great show.
{106518}{106562}Places, please!
{106564}{106602}Prayer's over.
{106632}{106681}Places. Have a good show.
{106714}{106772}- Why did I do that?|- That's all right.
{106774}{106825}- It's gonna be a great show.|- I hope I can sing.
{106827}{106875}I hope we all can now.
{106877}{106951}Do I have mousse in my hair?
{106953}{107057}One more time for the States?|Should we try to have a holiday?
{107059}{107095}Yeah, right.
{107097}{107141}Holiday
{107143}{107199}Celebration
{107201}{107300}Come together|in every nation
{107994}{108054}Holiday
{108094}{108129}Celebrate
{108403}{108452}If we took a holiday
{108501}{108549}Took some time to celebrate
{108605}{108654}Just one day out of life
{108656}{108703}Holiday
{108704}{108756}It would be
{108758}{108830}It would be so nice
{109010}{109061}We can turn this world around
{109118}{109224}And bring back|all of those happy days
{109252}{109343}Put your troubles down|Come on now
{109345}{109427}It's time to celebrate
{109458}{109515}Let love shine
{109550}{109607}And we will find
{109609}{109666}A way to come together
{109668}{109752}We can make things better
{109754}{109818}We need a holiday
{110250}{110287}All right, everybody!
{110318}{110366}Do the bus stop!
{110368}{110413}Oh, yeah!
{110414}{110472}Let me hear ya!
{110681}{110755}Now let me hear you scream!
{111935}{111971}You sing.
{111973}{112022}If we took a holiday
{112074}{112125}Everything would be okay
{112375}{112420}All right, everybody.
{112458}{112506}Let me hear you say 'Ho'!
{112734}{112774}All together now.
{113468}{113520}When we finally got to Europe...
{113522}{113581}there was such|an overwhelming sense of relief.
{113582}{113691}After all the tension and darkness,|Europe just felt so glamorous...
{113693}{113747}and new and exciting.
{113786}{113911}- Don't make her strike a pose.|- I've been living for Chanel.
{113913}{113999}Shopping can really|cheer a girl up.
{114034}{114130}Now, you boys better do what I say.
{114157}{114238}- Second grade teacher.|- Miss Crabtree.
{114240}{114282}Or Miss Brooks.
{114284}{114317}That's a perfect fit.
{114319}{114381}It's very|'obey everything I say.'
{114383}{114462}Yeah, it's like very|Janet Jackson, Rhythm Nation.
{114578}{114637}Bite your tongue.
{114639}{114722}Do you have any simpler earrings|than these?
{114789}{114842}They make you look beautiful.
{114844}{114900}Earrings don't make people|look beautiful.
{114927}{114983}Money makes people look beautiful.
{115041}{115115}Hello. Gautier,|listen, I told you.
{115191}{115258}Hi. Who's this? I'm fine.
{115260}{115297}Can I help you?
{115299}{115360}Would you like|anyone in particular?
{115392}{115435}What's your name?
{115437}{115483}Chanelta?
{115484}{115601}Chanelta needs a salesgirl|downstairs now.
{115638}{115676}Bye-bye. Thank you.
{115678}{115713}Bye. Thanks.
{115952}{116027}Happy birthday
{116028}{116098}Dear Melissa
{116178}{116242}Yo, Mel.|This is your birthday poem.
{116244}{116307}'Way back in the beginning...
{116309}{116376}when I started|all of my sinning...
{116378}{116446}I needed a partner in crime,|you could say...
{116448}{116529}so I went on a search|and I started to pray.
{116530}{116604}I walked into|my manager's office one morn.
{116606}{116682}I was mouthing out loud|in my usual form.
{116684}{116778}As my eyes toured the room,|my poor heart skipped a beat...
{116780}{116881}for there in the corner|was the picture of sweet.
{116979}{117095}She was glued to the phone.|She was bathed in pastels.
{117097}{117172}Her Lee press-ons were setting.
{117174}{117227}They were longer than hell.
{117289}{117362}I turned and I winked|and I said...
{117364}{117457}Hey, Miss Muffett, you think|you can work for a bitch?
{117459}{117519}Can you tough it?
{117521}{117595}I'm gagging! No way!|Get me outta this dump!
{117678}{117762}I said, Hey, Freddy,|find a new girl to pump.
{117933}{117996}So the rest is like history.|Legend, okay?
{117998}{118056}You want to hear dish?|She don't play it that way.
{118058}{118133}How can I thank you,|my sweet Melly-Mel?
{118135}{118211}You pick up my shit|and my undies that smell.
{118338}{118423}You shield me from assholes|and take all their calls.
{118425}{118511}You buy me my Tampax|and rubbers and all.
{118563}{118603}Size large.
{118694}{118801}'Now, you can't count on much|in this life. I should know.
{118803}{118876}But I guess I got lucky.|I found me a pro.
{118878}{118940}She still lives in the Valley...
{118942}{118995}but her press-ons are gone.
{119025}{119075}She still goes out with jocks...
{119077}{119134}but she sips Dom Perignon.
{119206}{119312}But without you, I'm nothing.|I'm gagging, Miss Thing.
{119314}{119401}If you ever leave me,|I'm gonna fuckin' kill myself.
{119755}{119837}Those first few weeks in Europe|were almost perfect.
{119839}{119920}It felt like|the Partridge Family world tour.
{119921}{119977}Sort of.
{119979}{120019}Congratulations!
{120021}{120070}Don't do it!|He's a tramp!
{120072}{120109}He's a slut!
{120111}{120147}Suck it.
{120192}{120242}Come in only if you're a man.
{120244}{120315}Girls, I'm here.|Mama Makeup.
{120352}{120419}Tell Jai Winding that|he doesn't come into 'Prayer.'
{120421}{120530}When I ask him to play the record,|I'm going to say--
{120635}{120730}- Voulez-vous will you kiss my dick?|- 'Will you play my record?'
{120731}{120788}One-track fucking mind, okay.
{120922}{120992}Here comes the bride
{120994}{121068}All dressed in white
{121195}{121243}Oh, that's really good.
{121286}{121334}I just pray I remember...
{121336}{121401}that I have to speak|French and English.
{121403}{121478}World tour in the year 2025.
{121480}{121544}Like a virgin
{121591}{121689}I got the moves, baby|You got the lotion
{121691}{121765}They don't even let|Zsa Zsa Gabor in this hotel.
{121767}{121840}- Why not?|- Because she's a cochonne.
{121867}{121943}Didn't know how lost I was
{121945}{122014}Until I found you
{122042}{122118}I was beat, incomplete
{122160}{122254}I was sad|I was hurt and blue
{122255}{122324}But you made me feel
{122326}{122375}The audiences have been great.
{122377}{122448}Every show just keeps getting|better and better.
{122450}{122504}So let us just have|one more great show...
{122506}{122594}where everybody kicks ass|and has a great time.
{122596}{122644}I'm fuckin' pissed, okay?
{122689}{122762}Okay, what are you|fuckin' lookin' at, huh?
{122811}{122880}When I'm pissed off,|I gotta express myself.
{122882}{122943}You know|what I'm fuckin' saying?
{123026}{123074}Sorry about that, Lenny.
{123156}{123208}Halfway through Europe,|my bubble burst.
{123210}{123284}I started hearing reports|from ltaly...
{123286}{123370}that the Vatican was trying|to ban the show.
{123401}{123479}I am an ltalian-American,|and I am proud of it...
{123481}{123529}proud of being an American...
{123531}{123592}because it is the country|I grew up in...
{123593}{123661}the country that gave me|the opportunities...
{123663}{123711}to be who I am today...
{123713}{123777}and a country that believes in|freedom of speech...
{123779}{123822}and artistic expression.
{124030}{124194}I have a tale to tell
{124241}{124328}Sometimes it gets so hard
{124330}{124412}To hide it well
{124492}{124558}I was not ready
{124560}{124631}For the fall
{124689}{124737}Too blind to see
{124739}{124840}The writing on the wall
{124912}{125005}A man can tell a thousand lies
{125007}{125088}I've learned my lesson well
{125090}{125148}I hope I live to tell
{125150}{125224}The secret I have learned
{125226}{125281}Till then
{125282}{125407}It will burn inside of me
{125514}{125613}Truth is never far behind
{125615}{125687}You've kept it hidden well
{125689}{125782}If I live to tell the secret
{125784}{125829}I knew then
{125831}{125881}Will I
{125883}{125994}Ever have the chance again
{126132}{126212}My show is not|a conventional rock show...
{126214}{126300}but a theatrical presentation|of my music.
{126302}{126348}And, like theater...
{126349}{126403}it asks questions...
{126404}{126494}provokes thoughts and takes you|on an emotional journey...
{126524}{126628}portraying good and bad,|light and dark...
{126630}{126681}joy and sorrow...
{126683}{126746}redemption and salvation.
{126748}{126823}I do not endorse a way of life...
{126825}{126867}but describe one...
{126869}{126968}and the audience is left to make|its own decisions and judgments.
{127128}{127199}This is what I consider|freedom of speech...
{127200}{127266}freedom of expression|and freedom of thought.
{127456}{127529}Every night,|before I go onstage...
{127531}{127593}I say a prayer...
{127595}{127653}not only that my show|will go well...
{127655}{127716}but that the audience|will watch...
{127717}{127799}with an open heart|and an open mind...
{127801}{127851}and see it as a celebration...
{127853}{127926}of love, life and humanity.
{128004}{128083}If I ran away
{128084}{128174}I'd never have the strength
{128175}{128233}To get very far
{128235}{128301}How could they hear
{128303}{128451}The beating of my heart
{128452}{128505}Will it grow cold
{128507}{128613}The secret that I hide
{128615}{128669}Will I grow old
{128671}{128727}How will they hear
{128728}{128781}When will they learn
{128783}{128869}How will they know
{128930}{129028}The controversy stayed with me|all through ltaly and...
{129030}{129105}eventually I had|to cancel two shows.
{129175}{129244}I got my period|suddenly early this month.
{129246}{129301}Look. This is my gym.
{129302}{129359}You want to use it?
{129361}{129425}- If you ever do, you can.|- Sandra--
{129427}{129491}Born-- Boin-- Or something.
{129526}{129619}I forgot her last name.|Sometimes I can't pronounce it.
{129621}{129694}- You know who I'm talking about.|- Try pronouncing it.
{129696}{129739}Bornhard.
{129799}{129847}Whatever her name was...
{129849}{129925}that's one of her best friends.
{129927}{130002}I had those dreams|when my mother died.
{130004}{130090}For like a five-year period after that,|that's all I dreamed about--
{130091}{130158}that people were jumping on me|and strangling me...
{130160}{130225}and I was constantly screaming|for my father...
{130227}{130286}and no sound would come out.
{130288}{130344}What happened when you woke up?|You were crying?
{130346}{130443}I'd be sweating and afraid|and have to go sleep with my father.
{130445}{130508}Was that before he got remarried?
{130510}{130575}How was that|when you slept with him?
{130577}{130662}Fine. I went right to sleep|after he fucked me. I'm just kidding.
{130664}{130710}Was he sweet to you?
{130711}{130748}Of course.
{130750}{130806}Barngard. Barnyard. Something.
{130871}{130925}Anyway, you know, she's scary.
{130960}{131055}So, I had a little fling|with another art world person.
{131057}{131106}Oh, should I guess?
{131108}{131159}An art dealer?
{131161}{131232}- A gallery owner.|- She's pretty sexy.
{131233}{131278}There's something about her.
{131279}{131353}She looks like if she was|having sex with someone...
{131354}{131443}she looks like she'd get a rope|and strap you to the bed.
{131445}{131509}Ooh, baby! Ow!
{131550}{131628}- I saw her before I left.|- Really? How unfortunate.
{131630}{131694}I'm like a drug addict,|you know?
{131696}{131763}Are you still sleeping with her?
{131765}{131830}Are you still fucking with her?
{131832}{131885}- Once in a--|- I don't like her.
{131887}{131945}I don't either.|Believe me, it's sickening.
{131947}{132010}I don't like the people|I sleep with either.
{132012}{132081}That's why you sleep with them--|'cause they're hideous.
{132155}{132231}By the time this comes out,|it won't matter anymore.
{132233}{132319}By the time this comes out,|she'll have fucked you over.
{132320}{132360}She already did.
{132410}{132514}You know, when I got to meet her|and whatever...
{132516}{132594}you know, she was pretty cool.
{132596}{132647}I'm so desperate.
{132649}{132715}- For what, honey?|- For some fun. It's all work.
{132717}{132797}- What kind of fun do you want to have?|- This is fun to me.
{132799}{132868}All I do is hang out|with everybody in the show.
{132870}{132950}- After a while, it gets boring.|- Who do you want to meet next?
{132996}{133057}Who do I want to meet next?
{133100}{133161}Who would really blow you away?
{133230}{133294}I think I've met everybody.
{133296}{133350}Just tell me one person.
{133352}{133426}That would really blow me away?
{133428}{133511}Who would really rock your world?
{133620}{133703}The guy that's in all of|Pedro Almodovar's movies.
{133705}{133757}- Antonio Bandares.|- I know him.
{133759}{133828}Antonio Bandares|was this Spanish actor...
{133830}{133901}that I've had a crush on|for two years.
{133903}{133968}He's in all of|Pedro Almodovar's movies.
{133970}{134018}I love Pedro's movies.
{134020}{134090}I've seen every movie|Antonio's ever done.
{134092}{134176}I have to say he's one of|the few actors...
{134178}{134251}that I was really dying to meet.
{134253}{134322}We get to Madrid,|and it turns out...
{134324}{134397}that Pedro wants to throw|this dinner party for me.
{134399}{134457}Of course,|Antonio's going to be there.
{134483}{134535}And so here I am.
{134537}{134643}I spend the whole week|psyching myself up for this party...
{134645}{134705}and I've got it|worked out in my head.
{134707}{134769}I'm going to make Antonio|fall madly in love with me.
{134771}{134875}Only there is this one obstacle|that I'd never counted on:
{134905}{134951}- his wife.|- You want?
{134953}{135020}I've been wanting|to meet Antonio for years.
{135021}{135094}I finally get to meet him,|and he's married.
{135096}{135172}-I am.|-That's one of life's little fuck-overs.
{135174}{135241}Don't worry. I'm just kidding.
{135243}{135287}Not.
{135288}{135377}- Oh, wow!|- This is Juan, Spanish star, too.
{135411}{135475}- Actor, singer.|- Nice to meet you. Are you married?
{135477}{135528}- Dancer.|- Are you married?
{135530}{135573}Bye! Bye-bye!
{135727}{135780}Hey, knock it off, fellas.
{135782}{135851}- What's wrong, baby?|- I've got to go drown my sorrows.
{135853}{135942}- Girl, you're ready to snatch him.|- I'm putting my head in the toilet.
{135984}{136054}Don't do it till we get home.
{136085}{136190}I said to Ricky, 'Fuck. This is|such a disaster. He's married.'
{136192}{136292}He goes, 'ln Spain it doesn't matter.|You can have whatever you want.'
{136294}{136368}- Just like in ltaly.|- Good thing I don't live here.
{136369}{136419}I would be a fighting bitch.
{136420}{136483}Is that man beautiful, or what?
{136512}{136560}There's gotta be|something wrong with him.
{136562}{136612}He probably has|a really small penis.
{136614}{136705}There's gotta be something wrong|with him. Nobody's that perfect.
{136706}{136794}I'm gonna go back in the room,|and who am I going to flirt with?
{136796}{136852}- I know who.|- That little shit.
{136854}{136903}The guy next to us.
{136905}{136955}Oh, my beautiful men.
{137029}{137090}I will sue them both. Go!
{137118}{137171}- Yes.|- You have to call me.
{137173}{137208}I'll call you.
{137209}{137272}- Tomorrow, right?|- Yes, yes, I'll call you.
{137324}{137359}Bye-bye.
{137412}{137486}Needless to say, I never saw|or heard from Antonio again.
{137513}{137590}I don't think he's such|a good actor after all.
{137592}{137648}Were there any messages?
{137650}{137707}No messages.
{137709}{137772}Madonna! Madonna!
{137964}{138053}My sleeping pill|didn't wear off yet.
{138055}{138094}So...
{138096}{138183}if I start acting like|Joey Heatherton, you'll understand.
{138472}{138564}Even when I feel like shit,|they still love me.
{138566}{138658}I think Madonna's a lot happier now|than on the last tour.
{138660}{138750}She's happy with|the effect she's had.
{138752}{138855}But I think there's a part of|her life that makes her unhappy.
{138857}{138929}I don't think|she takes enough time...
{138930}{139010}to appreciate and enjoy|her success.
{139012}{139099}She only thinks of the dance steps|she might have missed or--
{139100}{139175}Madonna does feel|more in control...
{139176}{139271}when she doesn't extend|her personal emotion...
{139273}{139367}her love, her exposure|to sensitivity too much.
{139369}{139426}Madonna's very difficult to reach.
{139427}{139480}She's put up many barriers.
{139482}{139555}I'm sure she's going through|a lot with these things...
{139557}{139638}'cause there's not many people|she can trust and get close to...
{139640}{139705}'cause I'm sure everyone|wants something from her.
{139707}{139751}She's fishing for affection.
{139753}{139861}I suppose she's fishing for people|who can be real and honest with her.
{139863}{139939}I don't really think|anybody is honest with her...
{139941}{139982}except for maybe me.
{139984}{140045}I'm certainly not honest|all the time.
{140046}{140116}We're all seeking Madonna's approval|to some degree.
{140118}{140180}Sometimes I feel like|she really trusts me...
{140182}{140271}and sometimes I feel like|she's not really looking at me.
{140272}{140383}Madonna has a hard time|connecting...
{140384}{140506}and giving herself away|to any one person.
{140508}{140627}I feel like she's--|Madonna's very in the moment.
{140629}{140692}She's very impatient.|Madonna's quite impatient.
{140694}{140753}It's just 'cause|she wants things done.
{140755}{140829}She has a lot to do.|She has a busy life.
{140831}{140895}She's definitely|in a race against time.
{140897}{140988}Everything is subject|to her approval...
{140990}{141029}or disapproval.
{141031}{141126}Everything has to do with what|she wants, what she doesn't want...
{141128}{141216}how it should look,|where it should go, what it should be.
{141218}{141253}It's very tense.
{141255}{141319}She's unhappy a lot of the time.|She's a bitch sometimes.
{141321}{141386}Madonna can be mean, if she wants to.|We all can.
{141388}{141440}A nice, relaxing morning.
{141442}{141499}- I love it when she's mean.|- She hasn't been a bitch to me.
{141500}{141579}She knows what she's doing.|She knows how to work.
{141581}{141657}That's probably why|she's such a big star.
{141659}{141777}I feel like she's a little girl|lost in a storm sometimes.
{141779}{141872}There's just like|a whole whirlwind of things...
{141874}{141926}going on around her and...
{141967}{142037}sometimes she|gets caught up in it.
{143473}{143521}Strike a pose.
{143899}{143951}Vogue, vogue, vogue

{146952}{147057}That's where I feel so beautiful
{147058}{147094}Magical
{147096}{147147}Life's a ball
{147149}{147206}So get up on the dance floor

{154204}{154276}but I'm not interested in that.
{154277}{154381}I'm interested in|pushing people's buttons...
{154383}{154448}and being provocative|and political.
{154450}{154552}It doesn't matter|if you win or lose
{154553}{154651}It's how you play the game|so get into the groove
{154653}{154738}You both could have anything|you wanted, if you want it.

{156761}{156826}I just think life is unfair.|Here I am.
{156828}{156930}Everybody thinks I have everything I|want, but I want you and can't have you.
{156932}{156982}You shouldn't have any more sex.
{156984}{157053}You should build an altar to me|in your home...
{157055}{157102}and worship it daily...
{157103}{157151}and call me collect.
{157153}{157233}- I've called him insane.|- You're the only woman I love.
{157234}{157312}You lied, Luis!|Now I'm going to beat you up.

{160556}{160604}Madonna can't afford real pearls
{160705}{160784}I can so! I'm rich.|I can have anything I want.

Our revels now are ended.
These our actors, as I foretold you...
... were all spirits
and are melted into air...
... into thin air.
And, like the baseless fabric
of this visi贸n...
... the cloud-capp 'd towers...
... the gorgeous palaces...
... the solemn temples...
... the great globe itself...
... ye all which it inherit...
... shall dissolve...
... and, like this insubstantial pageant
faded...
... leave not a wisp behind.
We are such stuff
as dreams are made on...
... and our little life
is rounded with a sleep.
Who's gonna say, "Action"?
Should I say it, or should you?
- You wanna say it?
You can say it.
- I don't want to. Say it.
- You say it.
- And action!
- How do I look?
I can't see anything.
Are they out there?
This is my entrance.
Fuck.
I'm actually reading Richard III...
...and I can't get on with it.
I've been reading it for six months.
You want to do it with your American accent?
We're getting $40 a day and all the doughnuts we can eat.
Shakespeare? What the fuck do you know about Shakespeare?
Arise, fair sun...
...and kill the envious moon.
Like eager droppings into milk, it doth posset and curd.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness...
...and some have greatness thrust upon them.
Intelligence is hooked with language.
When we speak with no feeling, we get nothing out of our society.
We should speak like Shakespeare.
We should introduce Shakespeare into the academics.
You know why? Because then the kids would have feelings.
- That's right.
- We have no feelings.
That's why it's easy for us to shoot each other.
We don't feel for each other, but if we were taught to feel...
...we wouldn't be so violent.
Shakespeare helps us?
He did more than help us.
He instructed us.
Hi. You gonna see the play tonight?
You're gonna see it, huh?
Hello.
How much it cost?
It's for free.
- Okay, I'm going.
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot.
- Your first Shakespeare play?
- Yeah.
- It'll be interesting. Give it a try.
- I saw Hamlet recently.
- How did you feel about it?
- Did you see it live? It what?
- It sucked.
- It what?
- It sucked. I saw it live.
- It sucked?
- Yeah.
Anything in Shakespeare that made you think it's not close to you...
- ...or connected to you in any way?
- Yeah, it's boring.
A bank in England uses
Shakespeare as...
Cover my account number.
See, it's a hologram.
They use it as ID to prove it's a real card.
What do you think of Shakespeare?
He's a great export.
Who's moving in on Shakespeare?
The Japanese.
Because they're kicking the Americans' ass.
And they're all interested in Shakespeare.
You know Shakespeare?
William Shakespeare?
We're peddling him on the streets.
I remember our English teacher sent us to see...
...a local college production of King Lear.
I went with my girlfriend...
...and after about 10 minutes of these people:
They were doing this kind of Shakespearean acting.
I just tuned right out. We made out in the back row and left at intermissi贸n.
I was brought up in a school...
...where Shakespeare was taught very kind of...
...straightforwardly and dully, to be honest.
We read it aloud and it made no sense, because there was no connection made.
My own experience...
...was in the fields in Michigan, where I was raised on a farm...
...and an uncle, who was a Northern guy, black Northern guy...
...came out of the field one day and started narrating...
...Antony's speech, the funeral oration.
- From Shakespeare's Julius Caesar?
- Yeah. We'd heard stuff from the Bible...
...but my first time as a kid,
I was hearing...
...great words having great meaning.
What brings us to Montreal?
To Paris? To London?
What takes us into dungeons, to parapets...
- To Japan next.
- To Japan, maybe, is a quest.
It has always been a dream of mine...
... to communicate how I feel
about Shakespeare to other people.
So I asked my friend Frederic Kimball,
who is an actor and a writer...
... and also our colleagues
Michael Hadge...
... and James Bulleit, to join me.
And by taking this one play,
Richard III...
... analyzing it, approaching it
from different angles...
... putting on costumes,
playing out scenes...
... we could communicate
both our passi贸n for it...
... our understanding
that we've come to...
... and in doing that...
... communicate a Shakespeare
that is about how we feel...
... and how we think today. That's
the effort we're gonna give it here.
We've done Richard three times. Twice.
You did it at the Studio, we've done it in Boston and on Broadway.
At least, the head start is that
I've done it. You've done it.
- But the problem, Frederic...
The audience hasn't done it.
- They haven't done it.
- It's a difficult play.
If someone were to ask you
about Richard III...
...what would you remember about it?
To be honest, I really don't remember that much, if anything at all.
Did you know that Richard III had a deformed arm and a deformed back?
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't know that?
The play, Richard III, about the guy with the humpback?
- No.
- You got me there.
Mm-mm.
He was a humpback? "A horse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse"?
- That comes from Richard III.
- It does, yes.
I mean, nobody knows who Richard III is.
- Nobody.
- It's a tough play to get.
The relationships between those characters.
- Who can keep it straight?
- Well, I think the question is...
...what is the understanding?
I mean, the understanding is...
It's a simply... Can you follow the story line and the plot?
We've provided this kind of docudrama-type thing...
...to inform some of the scenes so you know where you are.
For instance, there's an early scene
with the queen...
... and her brother and her two sons...
... which is outside in an anteroom...
...waiting for the king to call them in because he is inside, sick.
The queen is worried. She's afraid
the king will die, who is her husband.
And when he dies, the only...
The only people left to inherit the throne are her two young sons...
...by the king himself.
She has two sons by a previous marriage, which are in the scene.
And she's afraid that the character I play, Richard III of Gloucester...
...is going to take hold of the situation...
...and somehow manipulate them into thinking...
...that they're, you know...
That the kids are...
I'm confused just saying it.
I can imagine how you must feel...
...hearing me talk. It's confusing.
I don't know why we even bother doing this at all.
But we'll give it a little try.
Let's see what we can come up with.
First of all, let's get a smaller...
Let's work out of a smaller book than this. This is hard to carry.
- Excuse me, but look at this. "Hello?"
- I think...
"Yes. It's my entrance? Oh, I see."
It's good sometimes that you open it, and it is Richard, it's not Hamlet.
Sometimes in Shakespeare, there's a tendency...
...to confuse the plays.
The first act is about a sick king, and everybody maneuvering...
Sure.
...around. I wish that this play...
...could begin...
...on the body...
On the sleeping king...
...Edward IV, your brother, in bed.
Yeah.
And it pans up and you are standing over him, looking at him.
Yeah.
- Yes, but he's alive, the king is alive.
- Yes.
I would prefer having him off in the distance. I'd like...
- Good. You can watch him.
- I'd like to walk...
- Frederic? Can you get the other end?
- Yeah.
I'd like... Hi, how are you?
Frederic and I decided to go
to The Cloisters...
... a museum that has
a medieval setting...
... which is good for us because the play
takes place in this period.
We thought we'd rehearse
in this atmosphere.
We're shooting him.
We're shooting him.
I'll be with you in a minute, if you can just wait for me out there.
- So you're here.
- Okay. Okay.
- And here we are.
- Okay.
Now, you're Richard's brother, the sick king, and I'm Richard. Okay.
Yes. I move this way, and you follow me.
- Now...
- How exciting to start with "now."
You'd wake your audience up, wouldn't you? "Now!"
Now...
...is the winter of our discontent...
...made...
...glorious summer...
...by this sun of York.
It's a pun.
The sun of York is the sun in the sky...
...over the English countryside of York.
York is also your family name, and you are one of three sons of York.
Let me say it again, then.
Now...
...is the winter of our discontent...
...made glorious summer.
I said the opening speech from Richard to a group of students...
"Our discontent made glorious summer."
Anybody know what that means?
...who were interested, because I meant something, didn't know what I meant.
"Now is the winter of our discontent."
What am I saying?
He is referring to their part...
To the Wars of the Roses.
Before the play Richard III starts...
...we gotta know a little bit about what happened before.
What happened is, we've just been through a civil war...
...called the War of the Roses...
...in which the Lancasters and the Yorks clashed.
Two rival families,
and the Yorks won.
They beat the Lancasters, and they're
now in power. Richard is a York.
My brother Edward is the king now.
And my brother Clarence...
...is not the king, and me, I'm not the king.
I wanna be the king. It's that simple.
Key word, clearly, is...
Right from the start, is "discontent."
So Richard, in the very opening scene
of the play, tells us...
... just how badly he feels
about the peacetime worid...
... he finds himself in
and what he intends to do about it.
Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer...
...by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd on our house...
...in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Part of the trouble is that the Wars of the Roses...
...the wars for the crown, are now over...
...because the crown has been won by the Yorks...
...which means that they can stop fighting.
Now are our brows...
...bound with victorious wreaths.
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments.
Our stern alarum changed to merry meetings.
What do they do when the fighting stops?
Grim-visaged war...
...hath smooth'd his wrinkled front.
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds...
...to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers...
...nimbly in a lady's chamber...
...to the lascivious pleasings of a lute.
And you see lovemaking...
...and relations with the other gender...
...as what you translate your male aggressions into.
But Richard III has a little problem here.
But I...
...that am not shaped for sportive tricks...
...nor made to court...
...an amorous looking-glass.
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion...
...cheated of feature by dissembling nature, deformed.
- Deformed.
- He was a hunchback.
Deformed. Deformed.
Unfinish'd...
...sent before my time into this breathing worid...
...scarce half made up...
...and that so lamely and unfashionable...
...that dogs bark at me as I halt by them.
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace...
...have no delight to pass away the time...
...unless to see my shadow in the sun...
...and descant upon mine own deformity.
Shakespeare has exaggerated his deformity...
...in order to body forth dramatically...
...visually, metaphorically...
...the corruption of his mind.
Therefore...
...since I cannot prove a lover...
...to entertain these fair well-spoken days...
...I am determined to prove a villain...
...and to hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Richard's always saying:
"Here's the situation and what I'll do.
Watch this." Then he does it.
Then they leave, he says:
"Wasn't that good, or what?
Did you see? This is fun."
Plots have I laid...
...inductions dangerous...
...to set my brother Clarence and the king...
...in deadly hate the one against the other.
And if King Edward be as true...
...and just as I am subtle, false and treacherous...
...this day should Clarence be mew'd up...
...about a prophecy...
...that says that G of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
It's, "This day should Clarence be mew'd up...
...about a prophecy which says that G of Edward's heirs."
- Right.
- By "G," what does that mean?
- Yes?
- Clarence...
George, Duke of Clarence.
- His first name is really George.
- Whose first name?
Clarence's.
That's why he's called "G."
Yeah.
I suggest you change it to "C."
"This day should Clarence be mew'd up about a prophecy which says that...
...C of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be."
C of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul.
Here Clarence comes.
Cut.
What we gotta do, what we should do, is get actors in here...
...not audition them, just get them in...
... and let them just sit around,
just see and read.
We'll have different people read
different roles. Hopefully somehow...
...the role and the actor will merge.
The actor will find the role.
An actor will read one part...
... another actor reads another.
Hopefully, the casting will get done.
Who 's got Dorset?
Who's got Dorset?
How about Lord Grey?
Richard will read Dorset.
- He's gonna do Buckingham.
- I thought Jim would do it.
- He's doing Catesby.
- What do I read?
Dorset and Grey are the same people.
Dorset and Grey are the same...?
Yes.
You two guys better sit on each other.
We used two actors in the same part.
It'll take us four weeks of rehearsal to figure out what parts we're playing.
In more modern plays, we feel that
we understand it. It's there for us.
But in Shakespeare, you have an entire company on the stage...
...good actors not knowing where they're going. Where they are!
As Americans, what is that...?
That thing...
...that gets between us and Shakespeare?
That makes some of our best actors just stop when it comes to Shakespeare?
The problem with being an American in Shakespeare...
...is you approach it reverentially.
We have a feeling, I think...
...of inferiority to the way it has been done by the British.
I think Americans have been made to feel inhibited...
... because they've been told so long
by their critics...
... by their scholars and commentators...
... that they cannot do Shakespeare.
Therefore they think they can't, and you become totally self-conscious.
American actors are not self-conscious.
But they are when it comes to Shakespeare.
Because they've been told they can't do it, and they foolishly believed that.
Perhaps they don't go to picture galleries and read books as much as we do.
I think it's the effect of how everyone looked and behaved...
...that one got a sort of Elizabethan feeling of period.
Experienced classical actors...
...have a few things that they can use at a moment's notice.
The understanding of iambic pentameter, for one thing.
Everybody says, "lambic pentameter."
What is that supposed to mean?
Some say there are no rules.
I say there are rules...
...like the iambic pentameter, that must be learned...
...and can be rejected once learned.
"Pentameter" means "meter," and "pen," meaning "five."
So there's five beats.
Which, at its worst, sounds only like:
"Why, so. Now have I done a good day's work."
De-da de-da de-da de-da de-da.
And iambic is where the accent goes.
That's de-tum de-tum de-tum de-tum.
And five of them:
Da-da da-da da-da da-da da-da.
Make a pentameter line, five iambs.
An iamb is like an anteater.
Very high in the back and very short, little front legs. Da-da!
Shakespeare's poetry and his iambics...
...floated and descended through the pentameter of the soul.
And it's the soul, the spirit of real, concrete people going through hell...
...and sometimes moments of great...
...achievement and joy.
That is the pentameter you must focus on...
...and should you find that reality...
... all the iambics will fall into place.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul.
Here Clarence comes.
Brother, good day.
What means this armed guard that waits upon your grace?
His majesty tendering my safety, hath appointed this conduct...
...to convey me to the Tower.
- Upon what cause?
- Because my name is George.
Clarence...
...what is the matter? May I know?
Yea, Richard, as I know. But I protest as yet I do not. But, as I can learn...
...he hearkens after prophecies and dreams.
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And says a wizard told him that by G...
...his children disinherited should be.
And, for my name of George begins with
G, it follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these...
...have moved his highness to commit me now.
Why, so it is, when men are ruled by women.
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower, Clarence.
'Tis my Lady Grey his wife, 'tis she that tempts him to this extremity.
We are not safe, Clarence.
We are not safe.
Now, if Richard's
brother Edward was king, right?
And then he dies...
...Clarence, his other brother, is next in line.
No, the kids were next in line.
After the king's kids came Clarence.
So Richard figures, "I get rid of Clarence, then work out getting rid of the kids."
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood...
...touches me...
...deeper than you can imagine.
- I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
- Your imprisonment shall not be long.
I will deliver you, else lie for you.
Meantime, have patience.
- It's time, my lord.
- I must perforce.
- Must.
- Farewell.
It looks like Richard's plan
is really starting to work.
He got the king to put Clarence
in the Tower...
... by poisoning the king's mind
against him.
So now he's got one brother locked up,
the other brother, who 's king, is sick.
So he's in good shape.
He can move around.
He can maneuver. He's got room.
Go...
...tread the path thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence!
I do love thee so...
...that I shall shortly send thy soul to heaven.
Prisoner approaching.
Prisoner Hastings exeunt.
Who is this?
The new-deliver'd Hastings?
- Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
- As much unto my good lord Hastings.
Well are you welcome to this open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
You can do something from Shakespeare...
...think that you're feeling it or whatever.
Mm-hm.
You love it.
You think you're communicating it.
And the person you said it to has not understood a word you said.
You can't believe they didn't.
"Thoust" and, you know...
...just the way it's worded, that confuses the people of, you know...
...this time period.
Shakespeare used a lot of fancy words. You know?
And it's hard to understand, to grasp them.
They're not fancy words.
That's where we get confused.
But they're poetry. It's hard to grab hold of some rap slang too.
It's hard to get hold of it until your ear gets tuned. You have to tune up.
In a contemporary play, someone says:
"Hey, you. Go over there, get that thing and bring it to me."
That would be the line.
Shakespeare says it:
"Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels...
...and fly like thought from them to me again."
The King is weak and sickly...
- ...and his physicians fear him mightily.
- By Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long.
You shouldn't have to understand every single word.
Why? Do you understand every...?
I mean, it's not important.
It doesn 't matter.
As long as you get the gist of it.
Just trust it. You'll get it.
And if he were dead...
...what would betide on me?
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
They're trying to soothe her
because she is an hysteric.
- She is way out of control.
- But does that weaken...
...the reality of what's happening?
It strengthens the incompetence of others...
But why should they be incompetent?
- Why make them weaker?
- Because they went to Ludlow...
...with little train and got their heads cut off.
But then it's no great deed on his part if you make them weak.
They're not weak.
They're not weak...
...nor do I think that they're stupid.
I think...
By diminishing their importance, you diminish his actions.
- It's bound to happen.
- It's a very human, familial thing to say:
"Calm down. It will be all right."
But underneath it...
...they know what the scoop is, and I keep throwing back at them:
"Stop! You know damn well what's going on."
And that's why I'm hysterical.
You know it.
If he dies, that's it.
- Let's start the scene.
- Have patience, madam.
There's no doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustom'd health.
In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort.
And cheer his grace with quick and merry...
And that's the way you want me to behave, is that it?
If he were dead, what would betide on me?
No other harm, Mother, but loss of such a lord.
The loss of such a lord...
...includes all harm.
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son...
- ...to be your comforter when he's gone.
- Ah, he is young.
His minority is put into the trust of Richard Gloucester.
A man that loves not me...
...nor none of you.
We gotta come up with ideas, direction.
- We need a plan.
- We've got to start writing prefaces...
...or, like, a list that says,
"Today we'll do these scenes.
I want you to talk about Lady Anne and what happens to her."
How are you?
How you doing?
How do you feel about Shakespeare?
This feels good.
That's good.
- William Shakespeare?
- William Shakespeare, right.
- Do you like him?
- Of course.
Did you ever see Shakespeare?
- I never studied.
- You've never seen?
Never seen the show, but you still like him?
Sometimes I see something good on TV.
- Oh, TV.
- I like it.
But Shakespeare, you don't see?
No.
- That's too bad.
- There's no Shakespeare on TV.
No. Perfectly fine.
Sometimes it comes on.
"To be or not to be.
That is the question," right?
- Right.
- That is the question.
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.
I fear our happiness is at its height.
Who is it that complains unto the king...
...that I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
Because I cannot flatter...
...Iook fair, smile in men's faces...
...deceive, cog, duck with French nods and apish courtesy...
...I must be held a rancorous enemy.
The worid they live in...
...the worid they exist in is privy to these kinds of...
- Is internecine family quarrel.
- That's right.
They are clawing at each other for the throne.
Brother Gloucester, we know your meaning.
You envy my advancement and my friends'.
God grant we may never have need of you!
Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.
Our brother is imprison'd by your means...
...myself disgraced...
...the nobility of the house held in contempt...
...while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those...
...that scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
By Him that raised me to this careful height...
...from that contented hap which I enjoy'd...
...I never did incense his majesty against the Duke of Clarence.
You're gonna say you are not the mean of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment?
You see? Richard's stirring the pot.
The king is dying,
so he's fearful and paranoid...
... and sending people to jail.
This is a situation Richard loves.
He can use the fear...
... the turmoil to his advantage.
He knows they hate each other.
He'll use their hatred
to manipulate them.
You know, to divide, then conquer.
My Lord of Gloucester,
I have too long borne...
...these blunt upbraidings and these bitter scoffs.
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty of these gross taunts.
- I'd rather be a country servant...
- What!
Threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not.
Let me put it in your minds, if you forget...
...what you are ere this, and what you are.
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
Well, it is a complicated play too.
All those relationships and the wives, the Queen Margaret stuff is difficult.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out...
...in sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Margaret was the queen
before the war.
She was a Lancaster,
and she was dethroned by the Yorks.
She's a ghost of the past,
haunting the Yorks with her curses.
A husband and a son...
Don't you think she rants and raves around the castle like this a lot?
No!
No?
I don't think so.
I think she just comes in this day...
...because it's a crisis time.
She feels it.
Give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
It's primordial.
She brings that kind of music into this experience.
Poor painted queen.
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me to help thee...
...curse this poisonous bunchback'd toad.
Reading this play,
as I take word by word...
...everything she says happens.
Beware of yonder dog! Look.
Have not to do with him, beware of him.
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him...
...and all their messengers await on him.
Thou hateful wither'd hag, have done thy charm.
And leave out thee?
Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog.
Live each of you the subjects to his hate...
...and he to yours, and all of you to God's!
We don't say a word. We let her go.
The music...
Literally, I mean the music...
... and the thoughts and the concepts...
... and the feelings have not been
divorced from the words.
In England, you've had centuries in
which word has been totally divorced...
...from truth, and that's a problem for us actors.
If we think words are things and have no feelings in words...
...then we say things to each other that mean nothing.
But if we felt what we said, we'd say less and mean more.
Spare some change?
It'd be interesting to see where he...
- Is that possibly...?
- Where Shakespeare was born.
I think that's Shakespeare up there in the window.
Knock first. Knock, Frederic.
Hello. Frederic, you've...
Okay.
- Where was William Shakespeare born?
- There's the bed of birth.
- You gotta be kidding.
- I wouldn't kid about a thing like that.
It's too late.
It's a very, very small bed.
I was expecting to have an epiphany...
...an outpouring of the soul upon seeing...
- Go out and come in again.
- Where he was born.
If you're really an actor, you can come back and have an epiphany. I did.
- Only...
- Did you have one?
- I did not see it.
- I'm not showing it. It's an inner one.
We're not alone.
- Every once in a while...
- There's a fire truck out there.
- I think we tripped an alarm.
- We should pause and think...
You talked too loud and it set off an alarm.
Fire alarm. I got the fire officer.
We set it off.
- There's a fireman. Oh, yes.
- Hello.
Unfortunately, the sensor head is here.
There.
That's going to be the problem.
Yeah? What is it? Is it...?
That's a real bummer.
We come 6000 miles to see where he was born...
It's the greatest period in British arts.
This extraordinary development and maturing and death of drama.
In 20 years, Shakespeare's over.
You have our greatest drama.
And Shakespeare learns incredibly fast.
Already, in this very early play, he's thinking about people as actors...
...and about the stage.
And the imagination as a bit of life.
Hey, Jimmy?
How's the sandwich?
We're gonna bite the bullet and do Act 2 of the play.
What we said was, we're gonna shoot Richard's death...
- ...and murder of Clarence, and that's it.
- No, the king makes peace.
What are you saying?
We got an end of a movie to shoot.
"My horse..." "A horse. A horse.
My kingdom for a horse."
Fellas, the cops are here.
Police say we need a permit.
You said you'd take care of things.
What, I need...?
Why do I need a permit?
We have to give up a meal like this?
You have to go, guys. You have to go.
Hope you like turkey.
So, we are gonna get...
...a young Lady Anne.
I want somebody very young.
Very young. How young?
As young as you can get...
...and be able to do Shakespeare and understand the scenes.
Someone young enough to believe...
...in Richard's rap.
The problem is, we need someone who can speak the part...
...which is why you always have an older actress...
- ...because it takes maturity.
- You know, we don't need...
The problem of projecting the role...
...because it's a film, so we won't have the need for the actor to project.
- We need a film actress.
- Great, great.
Someone like...
We'll think of someone.
Well...
I will marry the beautiful Lady Anne.
What though I kill'd her husband and his father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends...
...is to become her husband and her father.
This language is
the language of thoughts.
To do this in the theater, you must speak loud.
There are very few actors who can speak loud and still be truthful.
That's the actor's problem.
Every actor knows the quieter he is, the closer he can be to himself.
When you play Shakespeare...
...in close-up, in a film...
...and have a mike and can really speak the verse...
... as quietly as this, you are not going
against the nature of verse.
You're going in the right direction because you're allowing the verse...
...to be a man speaking his inner worid.
Set down...
...set down your honourable load...
...if honour may be shrouded in a hearse.
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her.
I'll have her.
But I will not keep her long.
He says he'll have her...
...but he will not keep her long.
You're asking why he wants her?
Well, I think it's clear, he's out to get this girl.
To take her...
...in her heart's extremest hate.
He's killed her husband in the civil war.
Tears in her eyes!
And murdered her father-in-law.
The bleeding witness of my hatred by.
He's out to get her.
To win her!
Ha.
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Her mourning is genuine because she loved...
She goes out on the street, and is it an accident that she meets Richard...
...the man who killed this man and her husband?
Is it not possible that if...?
Did she have any idea...
...that if she went out with a corpse...
...making stops...?
You don't like that?
Does anybody have a better thing than Frederic on this?
You just said that we didn't answer the question...
...that what was...
Did that upset you?
No. Then what did you say?
You said you were gonna find a scholar...
...who'd speak directly into the camera and explain...
...what really happened with Richard and Anne.
And I am telling you that that is absolutely ridiculous.
You know more about Richard III...
...than any fucking scholar at Columbia or Harvard.
- Fred.
- This is ridiculous!
You are making this documentary to show that actors...
...truly are the possessors of a tradition...
...the proud inheritors of the understanding of Shakespeare.
Then you turn around and say,
"I'm gonna get a scholar to explain it."
- This is ridiculous!
- I hereby knight you, Frederic.
- Ph.D.
- Ph.D. Of the realm.
- Oh, God. Ridiculous.
- No, but the point is this, Frederic.
A person has an opinion.
It's only an opinion.
- It's never a question of right or wrong.
- There's no right or wrong.
It's an opinion. And a scholar has a right to an opinion as any of us.
But why does he get to speak directly to the camera?
I don't really know why he needed to marry her, historically.
I simply don't know.
Um, it's...
Stay, you that bear the corse.
Set it down.
Villains, set down the corse.
Or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
Unmanner'd dog!
Stand thou, when I command.
Advance thy halbert...
...higher than my breast, or, by
Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot.
Spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
Richard needs Anne...
... because he wants to be king.
So he needs a queen.
Anne is perfect for the job.
Also, she needs protection.
Because she was on the losing side
of the War of the Roses.
She's young, she has no husband.
Basically, she has no future.
For Richard, she's someone
who 'd represent...
... the other side,
the Lancasters coming to his side.
It says to the public that Anne has
forgiven him for killing her husband...
... therefore exonerating him
from his crime.
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
Yes, one place else...
...if you'll hear me name it.
Some dungeon.
Your bed-chamber.
I'll have her.
Gentle Lady Anne...
...to leave this keen encounter of our wits...
...and to fall something into a slower method...
...was not the causer of the timeless deaths of these two men...
...Henry and Edward, as blameful as the executioner?
Thou was the cause, and the accursed effect.
Thy beauty was the cause of that effect.
Thy beauty.
That did haunt me in my sleep...
...to undertake the death of all the worid...
...that I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
Teach not thy lip such scorn.
It was made for kissing, lady...
...not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive...
...Io, here. Here...
...I lend thee this sharp-pointed dagger.
If thou wish to hide in this true breast.
And let forth the soul that adoreth thee...
...I lay it naked to the deadly stroke...
...and I humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Nay, do not pause.
For I did kill King Henry...
...but 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch.
'Twas I stabbed Edward...
...but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.
Though I wish thy death,
I will not be thy executioner.
Bid me kill myself. I will do it.
- I have already.
- That was in thy rage.
Speak it again...
...and, even with the word, this hand...
...which, for thy love, did kill thy love...
...will, for thy love, kill a far truer love.
- I would I knew thy heart.
- My heart is figured in my tongue.
Well, put up your sword.
Say, then, my peace is made.
That shalt thou know hereafter.
Shall I live in hope?
All men, I hope, live so.
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
To take is not to give.
Look, how my ring encompasseth thy finger.
Even so...
...thy breast encloseth my poor heart.
Wear both of them...
...for both of them are thine.
Leave these sad designs...
...to him that hath most cause to be a mourner.
With all of my heart...
...and much it joys me too, to see you have become so penitent.
Ha!
- Tressel and Berkeley.
- Yes, madam.
Go along with me.
Bid me farewell.
Since you teach me how to flatter you...
...imagine that I will say farewell again.
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her.
But I will not keep her long!
- We'll never finish this movie.
- It's got to be what it is.
How much more will we shoot?
It's a movie about a play.
We're making a documentary about making Shakespeare accessible to people.
Those people, the people in the street.
They're not gonna get Richard III.
I can't even get it, it's too complicated.
Then why is it Shakespeare's most popular play?
- Wait, what did you say?
- Who says it's popular?
It is! It's performed more than Hamlet.
So what?
I run before my horse to market.
Clarence still lives and breathes.
Edward still reigns.
When they are gone...
...then must I count my gains.
But, soft! Here come my executioners.
Are you going to dispatch this thing?
We are, my lord.
Come to have the warrant...
...that we may be admitted to where he is.
Well thought upon.
I have it here about me.
But, sirs, be sudden in your execution.
Do not hear him plead.
For Clarence is well-spoken...
...and may move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
Be assured we go to use our hands...
...not our tongues.
I like you, lads.
About your business straight.
We will, my noble lord.
Go, go, dispatch.
Here's a place for the Clarence scene.
Just get Clarence very tight...
...in here, and you have all of the dead pigeon feathers...
...and the guano and the texture...
...of the wall.
Just imagine you're close in.
It doesn't work.
It's not just the pigeon stuff.
It doesn't work. It has no sense of...
- What are you...? When...?
- No enclosure.
Frederic, it's pointless.
For God's sakes, it's a prison.
- We need a place...
...where Clarence is being held prisoner.
It's gotta be a... It's a prison.
Aha. See the tower?
It's going to be in the chamber...
...where the bell ringing unit is.
It's a really beautiful space.
It's got this shaft of white light coming down from the top.
That's where we'd place that.
This is nice. Nice light.
Shall we stab him as he sleeps?
No. He'll say it was done cowardly, when he wakes.
He shall never wake until the great judgment-day.
Faith, certain dregs of conscience are here within me.
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
- Come, he dies.
- Where's thy conscience now?
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
When he opens his purse to give us thy reward...
- ...thy conscience flies out.
- 'Tis no matter.
- Few or none entertain it.
- What if it come to thee again?
I'll not meddle with it.
It makes a man a coward.
A man cannot steal, but it accuseth him.
A man cannot lie, but it cheques him.
A man cannot lie with his neighbor's wife...
...but it detects him.
And any man that means to live well...
...endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.
Come...
...shall we fall to work?
While this is going on with
Clarence, his brother is in the castle...
... trying to make peace.
They've been summoned
for the atonement meeting.
That's why everybody is in the castle.
The making peace.
The king's family are in incredible conflict.
He dares not die until he knows they won't pull the whole thing apart...
...as soon as he's dead.
I every day expect an embassage from my Redeemer to redeem me hence.
The king wants this peace to
happen because he wants to make sure...
... that after he's gone
his children will continue the reign.
He and his wife must hope...
...that they will.
We know that you have another agenda.
Strike!
No, we'll reason with him first.
Where art thou, keeper?
Give me a cup of wine.
You shall have wine enough, my lord...
...anon.
In God's name, what art thou?
A man...
...as you are.
- But not, as I am, royal.
- Nor you, as we are, loyal.
Who sent you hither?
Wherefore do you come?
To...
To...
- To murder me?
- Ay.
Ay.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
Offended us you have not...
...but the king.
I shall be reconciled to him again.
Never, my lord.
Therefore...
...prepare to die.
Hastings.
Rivers, take each other's hand.
Dissemble not your hatred...
...swear your love.
So prosper I...
...as I swear perfect love!
And so swear I.
Madam, yourself is not exempt from this.
Wife, love Lord Hastings...
...let him kiss your hand.
There, Hastings.
I never more shall remember our former hatred...
...so thrive I and mine.
Do they really believe all this?
Do they really believe it when you say,
"Take their hand"?
It's a vow.
A solemn vow.
In this time, that's a solemn thing.
Only people who want to go to hell would make vows and not keep them.
If you are hired for meed...
...go back again, and I will send you to my brother Richard...
...who shall reward you better for my life...
...than Edward will for tidings of my death.
Come, you deceive yourself. 'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
It cannot be...
...for he bewept my fortune...
... and swore, with sobs,
that he would labor my delivery.
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
So he doth...
...when he delivers you from this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
Make peace with God...
...for you must die, my lord.
Have you that holy feeling in your soul...
...to counsel me to make my peace with God?
And are you yet to your own souls...
...so blind, that you wilt war with God by murdering me?
O sirs...
...consider, those that set you on to do this deed...
...will hate you for the deed.
What shall we do?
Relent...
...and save your souls.
Relent! No. 'Tis cowardly and womanish.
Not to relent is brutish...
...savage...
...devilish.
My friend...
...I spy some pity in thy looks.
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer, come thou on my side, and entreat for me...
...as you would beg, were you in my distress.
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
Look behind you, my lord.
Is Clarence dead?
The order was reversed.
But he, poor man, by your first order died.
Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death?
My brother killed no man.
His fault was thought...
...and yet his punishment was bitter death.
Who sued to me for him?
Who kneel'd at my feet, and in my wrath, bid me be advised?
Who spoke of brotherhood?
Who spoke of love?
The proudest of you all...
...have been beholding to him in his life.
Yet not one of you would once beg for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold on me, and you...
...and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
What is it in theater?
Why do we want to do it?
We want to do theater because of that personal presence.
West Germany gave a billion dollars a year to the arts.
I gave up a TV movie in France to do Richard III in Milwaukee.
I was talking to my teacher,
and she said, "You will benefit."
Kevin Costner did that TV show.
- You lost out. Look at his career.
- He's afraid to do Shakespeare.
No, he's in the other room practicing.
The Anointed Shakespeare.
"Annotated."
It's got beautiful pictures.
It's got beautiful pictures.
That's what I like about Shakespeare, the pictures.
He's dead. Okay.
Okay.
Well, what are we gonna do?
- Okay.
- I like it.
What next?
What do you mean, you like it?
What time is it?
What are they doing, do you know?
Freddie said something about burying the king.
Is that in the play?
Here it goes. This is it.
This is the crunch.
Now we can say Richard
is the most powerful man at this point...
...alive.
All of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star.
The crisis is...
...are they going to live by the words that they spoke to the king...
... or are they not?
Is the peace going to hold?
I hope the king made peace with all of us...
...and that compact is firm and true in me.
- And so in me.
- And so say I.
Then go we to determine...
...who they shall be that shall post to Ludlow.
Who is going to go to Ludlow to get the young prince...
...and bring him back to be king?
Who 's gonna do it?
And Buckingham says,
"Whoever does do it...
...we go along too."
Whoever journeys to the Prince, let not us two stay at home.
Buckingham decides politically
to align himself with Richard.
He does everything for him in order to...
...help him, obviously wanting to help himself.
When I am king...
...claim thou of me the earidom of Hereford...
...and the moveables whereof the king my brother was possess'd.
Buckingham is like the secretary of state.
Like the guys who did the Iran-Contra stuff, the dirty work.
- Mm-hm.
- Propped up the king.
Without Buckingham, there's no Richard as king.
- Right. He couldn't do it alone.
- Mm-hm.
But then, they never can.
Shakespeare saw Richard Gloucester and Buckingham as gangsters.
They were thugs.
High-class, upper-class thugs.
There's been no influence here, has there? No influence.
What is thy news?
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret...
... and with them Sir Thomas Vaughan...
... prisoners.
Who hath committed them?
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham.
You're a pretty smart guy.
I can see it.
I see the ruin of my house.
Insulting tyranny begins to jet upon the innocent and aweless throne.
I can see it...
...as in a map, the end of all.
Now, Richard and Buckingham
have betrayed everybody.
They lied. They went to Ludlow
to pick up this prince.
They were supposed
to be peaceful.
They forced him out
from under his uncle's arms...
...and they've stolen this kid.
They're bringing him back.
What they have really got there
is the throne of England...
...in their arms.
The future.
They've got it.
Now is the winter of our discontent...
... made glorious summer...
... by this sun of York.
Welcome...
...to London.
This is the first chance since 1640s...
...to see the Globe Theatre.
This is where Shakespeare...
...wrote his plays, where he acted.
- Shakespeare owned it.
So this is the spot?
If you stand in the middle of it, what happens?
It's like a sounding board, like a resonating chamber.
- You can hear the wonderful acoustics.
- I hear it already.
Now is the winter of our discontent...
...made glorious summer...
...by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd on our house...
...in the deep bosom of the ocean...
- Hi. Are you working on this?
- I am. I've been recording it since 1980.
- You've been recording this since 1980?
- Yeah. The whole shebang.
- Really?
- And who is this?
This is the son of one of the builders.
Welcome, sweet prince, to London.
My thoughts' sovereign.
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
- I want more uncles here to welcome me.
- Sweet prince...
...those uncles which you want were dangerous.
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words...
...but look'd not on the poison of their hearts.
God keep you from such false friends!
God keep me from false friends!
But they were none.
The mayor of London comes to greet you.
Okay, now they got the kids. They got
the young prince who 'll be king.
- They got his brother.
- Richard has a happy family.
Yeah. Somebody's gotta go.
Will't please you pass along?
Myself and Buckingham entreat your mother to come...
...and welcome you at the Tower.
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
- What should you fear at the Tower?
- Nothing.
Why has he put them in the Tower?
He's going to kill them.
The Tower is where they execute...
They chop people's heads off.
There are many rooms up there.
So it can also go for meetings and different places.
But there is one specific spot up there...
...where they...
They do the...
You know, do the thing.
The one person who is in line is a child.
What a wonderful opportunity for all of us to get what we want.
- Of course.
- I'll basically be running the country.
One person 's standing
in their way: Lord Hastings.
Hastings loves this kid, the prince.
He really wants him to be
the next king.
Though the kid's in the Tower,
he believes he will be.
He's tough.
Tough Guy Hastings.
He was the former king's
closest friend.
They even shared a mistress.
Mistress Shore. Who is she?
She's Shakespeare's device
to connect Hastings and the king.
- They share the same woman.
- Good idea.
Hastings is a great threat
to Richard and Buckingham.
He can stop them,
so they have to stop him.
What shall we do...
...if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
Chop off his head.
What are you talking about, Richard?
You mean Richard wear the crown?
I think it's the only way.
- Think about it.
- Let me tell you something.
I'll have this crown...
...this crown ripped off...
...and shoved into a cow's belly...
...before I would allow that scum to defile the crown...
...by putting it on his head.
The text is only a means
of expressing what's behind the text.
If you get obsessed with the text...
This is a barrier to American actors...
...who get obsessed with the British way of regarding a text.
That isn't what matters. What matters is that you have to penetrate...
...into what, at every moment, it's about.
So at this point, Hastings does not take the threat of Richard seriously?
Absolutely not.
Anything can go on.
You think that this guy...?
So now we've got Stanley.
Lord Stanley.
He's a friend of Hastings
and he's trying to convince him...
... they should get out of the country
because Richard's planning a takeover.
Some treachery,
at the council meeting...
... to pick the prince's coronation date.
My noble lords. The cause why we are met is, to determine of the coronation.
In God's name, speak.
When is the royal day?
- Is all things ready for the royal time?
- It is, and wants but nomination.
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
Tomorrow has been prepared as a great feast day...
...of coronation and requires only that we at this table say yes.
We think we have been brought together
just to rubber-stamp the prince.
It's a fait accompli,
the prince will be king.
They're just there to pick the date.
Who knows Richard's mind in all this?
Who is the most inward with the noble duke?
On the duke's behalf
I'll give my voice...
...which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
In happy time, here comes the gentle duke.
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper.
But I trust...
...my absence doth neglect no design, which might have been concluded.
Had you not come, my lord...
...William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part...
I mean, your voice...
...for crowning of the king.
Than no man might be bolder.
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well. My lord of Ely!
When last I was in Holborn...
...I saw good strawberries in your garden there...
...I do beseech you send for some of them.
Marry, and will, my lord.
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Remember we talked the other day about a gathering of dons, in a way.
There's a lot of suspici贸n in this room.
I think there's a danger
to be in this room.
All of us in one spot.
And it's like somebody says,
"Just wait here, I'll be back."
Or, you know, "Wait in this room..."
And it's been like, "What's going on?"
It's simple.
They have to cut out Hastings...
... and only Richard
has the power to do it.
He's royal, a York,
but he must move fast.
It's his last chance to stop Hastings
from making the prince king.
They'll suck in Hastings
using his mistress, Jane Shore, as bait.
Provoke him to say the wrong thing.
Then everyone has to make a
choice, either Richard or Hastings.
Where is my lord, the Duke of Gloucester?
I have sent for these strawberries.
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.
There's some conceit or other likes him well...
...with that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
There's never a man in Christendom can lesser hide his love or hate than he.
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
What of his heart perceive you by any livelihood he show'd to-day?
Marry, that with no man here he is offended.
For, if he were, you'd seen it in his looks.
I pray you all...
...tell me what they deserve...
...that do conspire my death...
...with devilish plots of damned witchcraft...
...and that have prevail'd upon my body...
...with their hellish charms?
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord, makes me most forward...
...in this princely presence to doom the offenders, whosoe'er they be.
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
Then be your eyes the witness of their ill.
Look...
...how I am bewitch'd.
Behold mine arm...
...like a blasted sapling, wither'd up.
And this is Edward's wife...
...that monstrous witch...
...consorted with the harlot strumpet Shore...
...that by their witchcraft...
...thus have marked me.
- If they have done this deed...
- If!
If...
...thou protector of this damned strumpet...
Talkest thou to me of "ifs"?
Off with his head!
Now, by Saint Paul...
...I swear, I will not dine until I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliffe, look that it be done.
The rest, that love me...
...rise and follow me.
Stan...
Stanley!
Stan...
Woe for England!
Not a whit for me.
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
Come, dispatch.
'Tis bootless to exclaim.
Bloody Richard!
Hastings was the fly in the ointment.
The path is clear
for Buckingham and Richard.
They got the inner circle. They've
intimidated all the dukes and earis.
So now...
... all that's left is winning the people.
Every time there's an election
in this country, whether for mayor...
... president or city council...
...the fact is people are tired of the way it's been and want a change.
How now, how now, what say the citizens?
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, the citizens are mum.
I expected them to be boisterous,
and that they would come and rally.
- Did they so?
- No...
...so God help me, they spake not a word.
But, like dumb statues, stared each other on, and look'd deadly pale.
And did they so?
No!
What, are you deaf?
I'm saying, whatever their reaction...
- ...we had this plan.
- We still had it.
So they're being told...
... that here, right before your eyes,
is the man who will make it better.
And, see...
...a book of prayer in his hand, true ornaments...
...to know a holy man.
Irony is really only hypocrisy with style.
Here again, we love
Richard's irony, in a way.
We know he's as hard as nails, that he's only pretending to be religious.
They canvass like politicians.
Complete with lies and innuendo...
... they manage...
... to malign this young prince,
who is the rightful heir to the throne.
And they know it.
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
And they say he was a bastard...
... that his father was a bastard.
It's an act, and these people buy it.
It's a complete lie.
We heartily solicit you...
...to take on the kingly government of this your land...
...not as protector, steward, substitute, or lowly factor for another's gain.
But as successively from blood to blood...
...your right of birth, your empery, your own.
Since you will buckle fortune on my back...
...to bear her burden, whether I will or no...
...I must have patience to endure the load.
Long live Richard,
England's worthy king!
Long live King Richard!
In the midst of these noble concepts, these treaties and diplomatic pacts...
...he was saying the truth beneath all this...
...is absolutely the opposite.
The truth is that those in power...
...have total contempt for everything they promise...
...everything they pledge.
And that's what Shakespeare's great play is about.
The reason why Shakespeare is really important...
...is because, in the Talmudic theme...
I've taken Lady Macbeth and put her in a rock 'n' roll context.
She's singing the blues.
Which is really a yin-yang or Chinese.
Hamlet's like every kid who's freaked out...
...his mother, his father...
The way to truly live is to hold both points of view at the same time.
I have them singing the blues, doing the beat.
But an American audience gets intimidated. They hear "Hamlet."
They hear "Shakespeare."
You must get me out of this.
Get me out of this documentary.
This idea was a bad idea.
It's gone too far.
- Take you away from all this?
- I wanna go. I wanna...
I want to be the king.
I want to be king, Frederic.
Make me king.
Long live Richard,
England's worthy king!
Long live Richard,
England's worthy king!
As soon as he gets what
he wants, Lady Anne, the crown...
- ...then the whole thing...
- The emptiness of it.
- Cousin of Buckingham!
- My gracious sovereign?
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice and thy assistance...
...is King Richard...
...seated.
But shall we wear these glories for a day?
Or shall they last...
...and we rejoice in them?
Still they live and for ever may they last!
Buckingham...
...now do I play the touch.
Young Edward lives.
Think now what I would speak.
Say on, my loving lord.
Shall I be plain?
I wish the bastards...
...dead.
Why is it necessary now to kill them?
You're king. What difference...?
- It's...
- But as long as they live.
What sayest thou now?
Speak suddenly. Be brief.
Your grace may do his pleasure.
Thou art all ice...
...thy kindness freezeth.
Everybody may have a price...
...but for a lot of people, there is a fundamental decency.
It takes a long time for them to reach that point.
The action of the play, the sense of exciting movement...
...is Richard's finding out the point beyond which people won't go.
Say, then that I have thy consent...
...that they shall die?
It's an interesting question...
...about where Buckingham is...
How far he's willing to go, where he's willing to draw the line.
It's as if everything Buckingham does in the play...
...somehow manages to keep the blood off his hands.
Give me some little breath, some pause, dear my lord...
...before I speak positively in this.
I shall resolve you herein presently.
The king is angry.
None are for me...
...that look into me with considerate eyes.
He is bound to be left alone...
...because nobody can love the king...
...beyond the degree of their own egoism or their own goodness.
There will be a point.
He has reached Buckingham's point.
That deep-revolving...
...witty Buckingham...
...shall no longer be neighbor to my counsels.
What?
Hath he held out with me so long, untired...
...stops he now for breath?
Well...
...so be it.
When he went away, did he agree to do it, or was he gonna say:
"I can't, but give me what you promised"?
I think he's come back and says:
"Okay. We have to do it, let's bite the bullet. Let's do it."
But he's too late.
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind the late request...
- ...that you did sound me in.
- Well, let that rest.
- Dorset is fled to Richmond.
- I hear the news, my lord.
Stanley.
Yes, my sovereign?
Richmond is your wife's son...
...Iook to it.
My lord...
...I claim the gift...
...my due of promise...
...which your honor and your faith is pawn'd.
The earidom of Hereford and moveables which you promised I shall possess.
Stanley...
...look to your wife.
If she convey letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
What says your highness to my high request?
I do remember me,
Henry the Sixth did prophesy...
...when Richmond was just a little boy that Richmond would be king.
Perhaps.
- Perhaps...
- My lord! The earidom...
Richmond!
When last I was in Exeter...
...the mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle there...
...and call'd it Rougemont.
At which name I started, because a bard of Ireland told me once...
...that I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
- My Lord!
- Ay, what's o'clock?
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me.
Ay, but what's o'clock?
Upon the stroke of ten.
- Let it strike.
- Why let it strike?
Because...
...that, like a Jack...
...thou keep'st the stroke, tick-tock...
...betwixt your begging...
...and my meditation.
Tick-tock.
I am not...
...in the giving vein to-day.
May it please your grace...
...to resolve me in my suit?
Thou troublest me.
I am not...
...in the vein.
Thou dost scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day...
...when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow...
...and say poor Margaret...
...was a prophetess!
And thus be it so?
Repays me my deep service with such contempt...
...made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone...
...to Brecknock...
...while my fearful head is on!
You stand on brittle ground.
Will it last, or will someone next week say:
"Hey, they got a bum rap.
Let's push the case of the kids"?
The kids have got to go.
Is thy name Tyrell?
James Tyrell...
...and your most obedient subject.
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
Please you.
But I had rather kill two enemies.
Thou hast it.
Two deep enemies, foes to my rest and sweet sleep's disturbers...
...are they that I would have thee deal upon.
Tyrell...
...I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Let me have open means to come to them...
...and soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
Say it is done...
...and I will love thee, and prefer thee for it.
I will dispatch it straight.
I am so far in blood...
...that sin will pluck on sin.
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Any production of Richard III, the last act dribbles out for me.
- I'm gone.
- For me, the last act...
... Richard is the most accessible because it's clear...
...that Richard has attained this power now.
He's king and he's on the decline because as soon as he becomes king...
...they come at him from all sides.
Richmond is attacking.
This guy, Richmond,
his family were the losers...
... in the War of the Roses.
He had fled to France and was there
raising an army...
... to get the throne back
for the house of Lancaster.
My gracious sovereign...
...now in Devonshire, as I by friends am well advertised.
In Kent the Guildfords are in arms.
Every hour more competitors flock to the rebels.
Their power grows strong.
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset...
- ...in Yorkshire are in arms.
- Out, ye owls!
Nothing but songs of death?
Take thou that, till thou brings better news.
He suspects everyone around him.
He has no friends.
I'm listening, I'm listening.
Fellows in arms...
...and my most loving friends.
Thus far into the bowels of land we march'd without impediment.
And here receive we
from our father Stanley...
...lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
Ah...
The wretched, bloody,
and usurping boar...
... that spoil'd your summer fields
and fruitful vines...
...this foul swine is now even in the centre of this isle.
Every man's conscience is a thousand men...
...to fight against this guilty homicide.
Then, in God's name, march.
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings.
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
- Well.
- Am I dying?
That's what I want to know.
Am I dying?
When are we gonna kill Richard?
- I have a worse question.
- Excuse me?
I have a feeling...
...that your Richard will have earned his death...
...and we should think about a way to do it.
Close... Close... Close the door.
You're 98.6.
Put it under the tongue.
Then it doesn't click. If I'm 98.6, then you're a Shakespearean actor.
"On the 22nd of August, 1485, a battle was fought for the crown of England.
A short battle, ending in a decisive victory.
In that field, a crowned king, manfully fighting in the middle of his enemies...
...was slain and brought to his death."
Here, pitch our tent, here...
...even here in Bosworth field.
What is fascinating when you come to the last act...
...to the Battle of Bosworth, the battle itself goes for very little...
...apart from, "My horse. My horse.
Kingdom for a horse."
To me, the battle is really the ghost scene. The ghost scene is the battle.
Richard is visited in his sleep by
the ghosts of the people he's murdered.
Give me another horse.
Bind up my wounds.
Give me another horse!
Frederic and I decided to go
to the actual theater...
... where Richard III was performed
some 300 years ago...
... and this ghost scene was acted
on the stage here, in London.
We thought we'd rehearse
and see if we could get a sense...
... of those old spirits.
Method acting-type stuff.
I've always had trouble with this speech.
It's good when an actor has trouble with a speech...
...and goes and tries to do it.
I've heard you talking about Richard as a man who cannot find love.
A person who finally,
in the last scenes, knows...
... that he does not have
his own humanity, that he's lost it.
Tormenting dreams!
He has let the pursuit
of power totally corrupt him...
... and is alienated from his own body...
... and his own self.
Dream on, of bloody deeds and death.
Where are my children?
- Toad!
- Despair. Despairing. Death.
- Give me another horse.
- Where is thy brother, Clarence?
Get me a horse!
Get me a horse!
Yet thou didst kill my children.
- Despair. And die.
- Bind up my wounds.
Bloody Richard!
Soft! I did but dream.
Soft!
I did but dream.
O coward conscience...
...how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue.
It is now...
...dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
Richard.
Richard.
What do I fear?
Myself?
There is none else by.
Is there a murderer here? No.
Yes, I am.
Then fly!
From myself? No.
No.
I love myself.
Alas...
...I hate myself...
...for hateful deeds.
Guilty. Guilty.
Committed by myself.
Guilty.
I am a villain.
I am a villain.
Yet I lie. I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well.
Fool...
...do not flatter.
I shall despair.
There is no creature loves me.
When I die...
...no soul shall pity me.
Wherefore should they...
...since that I myself...
...find in myself...
...no pity to myself?
- My lord!
- Who is there?
Ratcliffe, my lord. 'Tis I.
Well, get out of here. I'm working.
- You got it.
- Let's try it one more time.
Catesby, my lord. 'Tis I.
- Catesby.
- The early village-cock...
...hath twice done salutation to the morn. Your friends are up...
- ...and buckle on their armor.
- Catesby.
I've had a fearful dream.
Catesby, I fear...
Nay, nay, good my lord...
...be not afraid of shadows.
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night...
...have struck more terror in the soul of Richard...
...than can the substance of
10,000 soldiers armed to proof...
...and led by shallow Richmond.
Come, come with me.
The silent hours steal on, and flaky darkness breaks within the east.
Stanley, look to your wife.
If she convey letters to Richmond, you shall answer.
Prepare thy battle early in the morning...
...and put thy fortune to the test of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
You have to give a speech in half an hour.
- Maybe we should...
- No, I got the general...
...gist of it.
Got the gist of it.
O Thou...
...whose captain I account myself...
...Iook on my forces with a gracious eye.
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath...
...that they may crush down with a heavy fall...
...the usurping helmets of our adversaries!
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
Remember whom you are to deal withal.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways...
...a scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants...
...whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth...
...to desperate adventures and assured destruction.
Make us thy ministers of chastisement.
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest.
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives...
...they will restrain the one, distain the other.
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow?
To thee I do commend my watchful soul...
...ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.
A milk-sop...
...one that never in his life felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
O, defend me still!
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again.
Lash hence these overweening rags of France...
...these famish'd beggars, weary of their lives.
If we be conquer'd...
...let men conquer us...
...not these bastard Bretons.
Shall these enjoy our lands?
Lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters?
Hark! I hear their drum.
Fight, gentlemen of England!
Fight, bold yoemen!
Draw, archers...
...draw your arrows to the head!
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood.
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
My horse!
My horse!
And in a bloody battle end thy days!
Despair, and die!
They withdraw.
See? They're deserting him.
A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!
Withdraw, my lord, withdraw...
Slave, I set my life upon a cast,
I'll stand the hazard of the die.
There be six Richmonds in the field.
- Five have I slain to-day.
- My lord!
Although he's frightfully clever...
... he is, at the same time,
like a kind of boar...
... who has subsumed into himself
all these frightful animal images...
... and all that the rest have got to do
is to hunt the boar.
And that's what they do, and they get him.
A horse!
A horse!
My kingdom...
...for a horse!
He's a hearty dude, and in the end, he's surrounded and he just goes...
He'll give up anything for a horse.
He's rich, a king, and he needs a horse.
My kingdom for a horse.
- I didn't mean it.
- I love you, Frederic.
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.
He didn 't mean it.
You kill me, after all I did for you.
- Richard's dead.
- Richard's...
At last we can rest.
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends, the day is ours...
- ...the bloody dog is dead.
- Dead!
- Is this it?
- I hope so.
Are we done? This is it?
If I told him about the 10 rolls of film, he'd want to use it.
I love the silence.
I love the silence.
After silence, what else is there?
What's the line?
- "The rest is silence."
- Silences.
Whatever I'm saying,
I know Shakespeare said it.
Our revels now are ended.
These our actors, as I foretold you...
... were all spirits
and are melted into air...
... into thin air.
And, like the baseless fabric
of this visi贸n...
... the cloud-capp 'd towers...
... the gorgeous palaces...
... the solemn temples...
... ye all which it inherit...
... shall dissolve...
... and, like this insubstantial
pageant faded...
... leave not a wisp behind.
We are such stuff
as dreams are made on...
... and our little life
is rounded with a sleep.
Yeah, I'm in Africa.
Yeah, Africa's my home.
Damn America and what America thinks.
Yeah, I live in America, but Africa's the home of the black man.
I was a slave 400 years ago, and I'm going back home to fight among my brothers.
Yeah!
For these two African Americans to come home was of great, great significance.
Because of Hollywood and TV, a lot of us had been taught to hate Africa.
There was a time if you called a black person "African," they'd be ready to fight.
When I get to Africa, we gonna get it on because we don't get along!
I'm gonna eat him up!
Too much speed for him!
Too fast! Too fast! That's right!
I'm gonna retire the heavyweight champion of the world!
I'm gonna retire the heavyweight champion of the world!
September 25, the world will be stunned!
- Tell 'em, Ali!
- That's right.
If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I kick Foreman's behind!
An 18-year-old amateur boxing champion with a charming smile took a physical examination for his first professional fight.
It won't be an easy fight, but my plan of attack on a fighter like Alex Miteff would be two fast left jabs, a rapid right cross and a left hook.
But in the Belgian Congo, freedom was followed by rioting and army mutiny.
For months, the political pattern kept changing with kaleidoscopic speed until pro-Red Premier Lumumba was seized by the forces of strongman Colonel Mobutu.
After watching Mike DeJohn and Eddie Machen the other night,
I would rate myself number two now.
I'm out to break Floyd Patterson's record, and by this being my 20th birthday, today, January 17, that leaves me exactly one year to reach my goal.
People do say I'm cocky.
Some say I need a good whuppin'.
Some say I talk too much.
But anything that I say,
I'm willing to back up.
The other night I predicted that I would knock out this Banks in four rounds, and I did.
I knocked out Don Warner in four rounds, and I just annihilated George Logan in four rounds.
Let me see you close your mouth and just keep it closed.
- You know that's impossible.
- No, keep it closed.
You know that's impossible.
I'm the greatest.
I'm knocking out all bums. And if you get too smart, I'll knock you out.
- You'd take him on before the fight?
- Beat him like I'm his daddy.
I saw Sonny Liston a few days ago, Cassius...
Ain't he ugly?
I'm young, I'm handsome,
I'm fast, I'm pretty, and can't possibly be beat.
Cassius Clay goes into the record book with Corbett, Tunney and Braddock as another who brought off one of the great upsets in the heavyweight history.
It is befitting that I leave the game just like I came in... beating a big, bad monster who knocks out everybody and no one can whup him.
That's when that little Cassius Clay from Louisville, Kentucky, came up and stopped Sonny Liston, the man who annihilated
Floyd Patterson twice.
He was gonna kill me!
But he hit harder than George.
His reach was longer than George.
He's a better boxer than George.
And I'm better now than I was when you saw that 22-year-old undeveloped kid running from Sonny Liston.
I'm experienced now, professional.
Jaw's been broke, been knocked down a couple times.
I'm bad!
Been chopping trees.
I done something new for this fight.
I done rassled with an alligator.
That's right.
I have rassled with an alligator!
I done tussled with a whale.
I done handcuffed lightning, throwed thunder in jail.
That's bad!
Only last week, I murdered a rock!
Injured a stone! Hospitalized a brick!
- I'm so mean I make medicine sick.
- Bad dude!
- Bad. Fast.
- Ain't no doubt.
Fast! Fast!
Last night,
I cut the light off in my bedroom, hit the switch, was in the bed before the room was dark.
- Incredible. Incredible.
- Fast.
And you, George Foreman, all you chumps are gonna bow when I whup him!
All of you! I know you got him.
I know you got him picked.
But the man's in trouble.
I'm gonna show you how great I am!
Hell, I think Ali was scared.
I think he was scared even then.
He knew he was gonna be very scared as he got closer to the fight.
You know the way George fights.
George comes out...
I named him the Mummy!
With his ego, he could keep telling himself he would dominate Foreman, that he would beat him, that he would dance, make a fool of him, that he would show him superior boxing, that Foreman would never lay a glove on him.
But in fact, in his sleep or wherever his private moment came, he had to know that he had not done nearly as well against two fighters particularly:
Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, whom Foreman had demolished.
Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!
The heavyweight champion is taking the mandatory eight count, and Foreman is as poised as can be!
Foreman is going about his job!
He had an overpowering intensity when he punched.
Foreman had won his championship by knocking Joe Frazier out, and knocked him down something like seven times.
Then he destroyed Ken Norton in two rounds.
The word "murderous" does not quite apply.
Foreman was awesome.
This chump has got everybody scared.
Scared of what?
Nothing to be scared of.
Scared of what?
How many fellas in here now picks George?
Be truthful. Be men.
Tell the truth.
John, raise your hand.
Got George?
You got George? Tell the truth.
- You. You, fella. Yeah.
- Me?
- No pick.
- No pick?
I just wanna know. You got George.
The time may have come to say good-bye to Muhammad Ali, because very honestly,
I don't think he can beat George Foreman.
Howard Cosell, you told everybody
I don't have a chance.
You told 'em
I don't have nothing but a prayer.
Well, chump, all I need is a prayer, because if that prayer reach the right man, not only will George Foreman fall but mountains will fall.
Maybe he can pull off a miracle.
But against George Foreman?
So young, so strong, so fearless?
Against George Foreman, who does away with his opponents one after another in less than three rounds?
It's hard for me to conjure with that.
You're always talking about,
"Muhammad, you're not the same man you were ten years ago."
I asked your wife, and she told me you're not the same man you was two years ago!
After this fight,
I suspect Ali will retire.
And through all of the years, my own memories of him will be as a fighter and as the strange and curious and gregarious and engaging and sometimes cruel and sometimes family man that he is.
I'm gonna let everybody know that that thing you got on your head is a phony, and it comes from the tail of a pony.
A stolen bicycle.
He had a bicycle, and he went to Columbia Gym.
There was something going on up there, and he left his bike parked outside.
So when he came out, someone had stole it, and he went inside, and he was crying, and he told the policeman there, his name was Joe Martin, that someone stole his bike.
And Joe Martin, he would also teach the little boys how to box in the evening.
So he asked him, would he be interested in learning how to box?
And he told him yes, because if he ever found out who stole his bike, he wanted to know how to fight so he could beat them up.
An overhand right sends Sonny to the canvas!
Referee Jersey Joe Walcott trying to get Ali to a neutral corner.
Ali yelling at Liston to get up and fight!
The anchor punch.
- Which punch?
- Anchor. I call it the anchor punch.
- The one Stepin Fetchit helped you with?
- Yeah, man.
And people couldn't see it.
It was so fast...
Sports Illustrated clocked it.
They got a slow-motion camera.
They clocked the punch, and the punch flew at 4/100 of a second.
You can break a second down to a hundred pieces.
You know how people win a ski race, they say, "He won in 16/100, he won in 32/100 of a second."
So you break a second down to 100 pieces.
So, you know, yeah, it's quick.
So 4/100... They got a machine that goes, like, br-r-r-t, real quick.
Br-r-r-t. And it counts real quick.
You know, br-r-r-t. Real quick.
And by the time that thing hit four, that's how quick...
From the time the punch started to where it landed, it was 4/100 of a second, which is an eye blink.
Like a camera flash.
That's 4/100 of a second.
Now, the minute I hit Sonny Liston, all those people blinked at that moment, and that's why they didn't see the punch.
I swear.
If you watch the film close...
You gotta hold your eyes real close...
Keep looking.
All right, I'm getting ready to hit him.
You can't just...
You got to hold your eyes and wait or you won't see it, man!
They have this beautiful, you know, specimen, a fighting machine, that was handsome, he was articulate, he was funny, charismatic... and was whuppin' ass too.
Deposed heavyweight champion Cassius Clay, at a federal court in Houston, is found guilty of violating the US Selective Service laws by refusing to be inducted.
He is sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000.
The way he fused politics and sports...
Very few black athletes had ever talked the way Muhammad Ali talked without fear of something happening to them in their career.
...status as a Black Muslim minister made him exempt from the draft.
He was already very unpopular with mainstream Americans because he had joined an organization known as the Nation of Islam, which was perceived as a radical black separatist group.
And then on top of that, when he was called for induction and refused to take the step forward, he absolutely infuriated America.
Muhammad Ali said,
"No Viet Cong ever called me nigger."
The king is going home to get his throne.
From the root to the fruit.
That's where everything started at.
This is God's act, and you a part of it.
This is no Hollywood set. This is real.
Hollywood come in and take these kind of scenes and set 'em up, have somebody in the movies playing his life.
This is real. We don't pick up a script.
We get up in the morning feeling tired.
Sometimes we feel good, sometimes bad.
- But we go through it with feeling.
- Time!
Muhammad Ali were born to do it.
He's a prophet. He gonna be a fisherman for Elijah Muhammad.
This is only a stop, look and listen sign he's doing, fighting.
We've been fightin' ever since we even met.
We beat Uncle Sam. Three and a half years.
Come out of the garage and beat number two.
First man ever did it. The rest of 'em they put out of the country.
This is God's act. We just actors in it.
If Jesus was here, everybody would want his autograph, and if films was around when he was around, they'd be filming him.
The only thing, this is a sport.
That's why you walking, talk to him.
I think Muhammad is a prophet.
How you gonna beat God's son?
Anybody who loves poor people and little people gotta be a prophet.
He was champion of the world, had a long table full of food.
Had a house for his mother, one for him, and he told 'em to take it and shove it.
If he couldn't love his god, what do you think he is... mister?
Get it together!
Get it together! Get it together!
Ali trained for the fight with Foreman at Deer Lake, Pennsylvania.
He trained very hard for that fight...
- One more.
- ...and had very good sparring partners.
Larry Holmes was one of his sparring partners.
I was struck with how well, uh, he handled... he'd actually handled Ali in their sparring sessions.
He'd dominated Ali. That wasn't uncommon.
Ali very often would not show his best stuff with his sparring partners, but in fact would work on his weaknesses.
He'd go against the ropes, and he'd let people pummel him.
Heavy hitters who were sort of clumsy, he'd let them bang away at him.
It was as if he wanted to train his body to receive these messages of punishment and absorb them faster than other fighters could absorb them.
True significance of why this fight's being fought in Africa is because they came up with $10 million.
Five million dollars for George Foreman, five million dollars for me.
London, England, was trying to get it.
A promoter said
America were trying to get it.
But none of them could surpass the $5 million mark.
The dream is now becoming a reality.
Don King went to George Foreman and got Foreman to sign an option agreement saying that if King could deliver $5 million,
Foreman would fight Ali.
Then King went to Ali and made the same deal with him.
So Don King now had both fighters, their signatures on a piece of paper.
What he didn't have was $10 million.
...a festival that will complement this great sporting event, the greatest sporting event in the history of the world.
- Greatest of all time!
- Of all time, as the champ says.
- The greatest event of all time!
- With some...
Bigger than Evel Knievel and the Kentucky Derby on the same day.
The president of Zaire was willing to put $10 million of his country's own very scarce, hard-earned currency on the line, not for any short-term economic reason but because he felt that the fight would be good in terms of promoting Zaire and also in terms of promoting himself.
And as Ali said at the time, countries go to war to get their names on the map, and wars cost a lot more than $10 million.
Some of the most dynamic performers from Afro-America will be appearing down there at the stadium in Kinshasa on the 20th, the 21st and the 22nd, along with the world, and with its theatrical release.
It will be James Brown, who is soul brother number one,
- one of our top, leading black artists.
- Is he coming?
Yes,
James Brown will be there performing.
We will have BB King, the Spinners...
This is the first assembly in the history of all America where all the top-notch blacks of America and the people of Africa had something together, all on the world level.
We're all meeting each other and learning more about each other.
It's the first assembly among American black men and Africans like us in the history of the world.
And it's a big honor to be part of that.
Plus I gotta whup George!
Got to whup George!
We're gonna rumble in the jungle!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Speak to 'em. Go ahead.
Good boy. Get down.
- Back. You're good.
- George?
Is this fight against Ali will be the toughest of your career, you think?
Could be. Could be. I doubt it.
This is Muhammad Ali,
September 10, at New York City Airport en route to Zaire to reclaim the heavyweight title of the world.
Champ, what would you like to say to the children of the world?
I'd like to tell the children of the world, mainly right here where they speak and understand English in America, to live a clean life.
Stay off of dope.
It's tearing the country up.
Also, if they want to be like me,
I'm getting ready to whup George Foreman, and by the time they see this,
I will have beaten him.
Tell them to quit eating so much candy.
I have three rotten teeth. They're bad, and I had to have one of 'em pulled.
I can't chew my food like I should.
Eat natural foods because we must whup Mr. Tooth Decay.
I got one right there and one right here.
Yesterday Ali told us that he's going to use part of his money for the building of a hospital.
Do you intend yourself to use part of your money for something?
Have you got a project?
He may think he may have to be in the hospital.
I want the man!
Yeah, when I get to Africa, we gonna get it on because we don't get along!
I don't like him. He talks too much.
Beg your pardon?
You would continue boxing even if you would lose over there?
I beg your pardon?
You don't think about losing?
No. Thank you. Nice talking with you.
Flying over the Sahara Desert on an African airline with all African stewardesses, all African pilots.
Boy, this is the first free feeling
I've had in a long time.
Ain't this something, flying in an airplane with all black pilots?
- All black crew?
- Crazy!
This is strange to the American Negro.
We never dreamed of this.
And every time we watch television, they show us Tarzan and the natives and the jungles.
They never told us that the Africans were more intelligent than we are.
They speak English...
They speak English, French and African.
We can't even speak English good.
Ain't this beautiful? I'm free!
Fantastic!
I'm free.
Now, I want everybody to repeat after me.
If you don't know who you are and where your place in life is,
- just say to yourself, I am!
- I am!
- Somebody!
- Somebody!
- I am!
- I am!
- Somebody!
- Somebody!
- I may be poor.
- I may be poor.
- But I am.
- But I am.
Somebody.
It was a great joy to see that the championship was going to happen in Africa.
People were so happy.
At last, the world was paying attention to our continent.
Yes, we knew Muhammad Ali as a boxer, but more importantly for his political stance.
When we saw that America was at war in a third-world country, Vietnam... and that one of the children of the United States said, "Me?
You want me to go and fight against the Viet Cong?
Why should I fight against them?
They haven't done anything against me."
And for us, it was extraordinary to see that in the America of that time, someone could take such a position.
He may have lost his title, he may have lost millions of dollars, but that's where he gained the esteem of millions of Africans.
Ali! Ali! Ali!
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!
What is... What is your population?
- Twenty-two million.
- Twenty-two million?
- Twenty-two million.
- How many George Foreman fans here?
We don't know, we don't know.
- How many Muhammad Ali?
- There are so many we cannot count them.
George Foreman?
We didn't know who he was.
We had heard that he was a world champion.
We thought he was white.
Then we realized he was black, like Muhammad Ali.
But still, for us,
Foreman represented America.
He arrived with a dog, a German shepherd, which immediately offended Africans, since the Belgians had used shepherds as police dogs.
Ali said that he's the hometown fighter and you're the out-of-towner here.
Africa is the cradle of civilization.
Everybody's home is Africa.
Okay, fine. So they're leaving tomorrow.
Typhoid. How do you spell "typhoid"?
Is that all that we're giving?
Who do you want to be your beneficiary in case of anything.
And then sign it.
You need an actual airline ticket to get on this plane.
Let me see some hands of the 51 who don't have tickets.
Who doesn't have an airline ticket?
Hi!
You know who we are, don't you?
I'm Lola Love, and I'm one of the dancers with the James Brown show... revue.
"Zai-ere," or "Zare," or whatever you... you know.
Yeah, man.
When are gonna get to Zee-air?
- To who?
- Mobutu land.
To Zee-air?
We're gonna fly in zee-air till we get to Zaire.

Hello, Bubba!
You ready to dance?
I got ants in my pants. I gotta dance.
Of course, the fight was held in Zaire, the former Belgian Congo.
Kinshasa was the capital, on the banks of the Congo.
It was just before the rainy season when this fight took place.
Off to the north you could see the flickering of storms, uh, coming closer and closer, and it was important to the promoters that this fight get in before the storms occurred, because once the rainy season comes, you can't do anything.
I always thought the Congo had such a wonderful name...
Conradian and all that.
Somehow to call it Zaire didn't have quite the majesty.
But there it was, the Congo.
Mobutu was everywhere.
He was the equivalent in Africa of Joseph Stalin.
You saw his picture everywhere.
And of course, part of the vanity of dictators, they almost always...
With the possible exception of Mussolini, who was half ugly and half attractive, most dictators are unbelievably ugly or plain.
Franco, Hitler.
Mobutu looked the archetype.
He was the epitome of a closet sadist.
Sort of guy, if you meet him in a bar, you think, "Oh, my God.
Who are the poor women who are associated with this fella?"
And since Mobutu was an extraordinarily practical man for his country, down under the stadium, which seated 100,000 people, were detention pens and rooms and chambers where you could imprison as many as a couple thousand people at once.
Before the fight came, the criminal rate in Zaire began to go up, and a few white foreigners had been killed driving their cars.
And Mobutu decided that this was going to be a disaster in terms of publicity, so on a given day, he had a thousand of the leading criminals in Kinshasa rounded up and put in this stadium, down in the detention pens.
And then, the legend has it, and I suspect the legend may even be true, that he had a hundred of them taken at random and killed them.
And the reason was a particularly simple one from Mobutu's point of view:
Criminals who make a life out of it have connections that protect them when they're in trouble, and by making this kill of a hundred out of a thousand arbitrarily, what Mobutu was saying is,
"Your connections are worth nothing.
I am Jehovah.
I am going to blast you out of existence if you fool around with me."
And he made his point.
Kinshasa was one of the safest cities not only in all of Africa but probably in all of the world while the foreign press was there for the fight.
To me, the drum has been the communicator since the beginning of time.
I'm sure it was the first message ever sent.
When I think of the beat today and I think of the beats centuries ago, it's the only thing that kept us together.
We had this thing, when we hurt, we sung for trial and tribulation, we sung for relief, we sung songs of God, and this music that you hear today is the same songs that have been made popular throughout the world without anybody's intentions or volition.
Oh!
So I would say that anybody who knows anything about the rhythm and the blues, as they're so-called today, should know about Africa.

The music I'm listening to now, if I went to your house or most white people's places,
I don't hear this kind of music, because your culture wouldn't...
Your woman didn't leave you.
Your woman didn't go out, slip off on you like our women, because you didn't have no money.
You had money to keep your woman.

The great place to visit in Kinshasa was a compound about 20 miles up the Congo River, a place called Nsele, which was a presidential palace.
That was where we saw Foreman, who seemed incredible.
I'd seen him fight before.
I saw him destroy Frazier.
I'd never seen destruction like that, and the thing I always remembered was that the beaten fighter, even a man as powerful and big as Frazier... and he was very much favored to win that... suddenly becomes about the size of a Pygmy.
They just diminish in size.
And Foreman suddenly became this gigantic figure.
And he had a trainer, Dick Sadler, tiny by comparison to Foreman, and Sadler would hang on to the heavy bag.
But Foreman would hit this... this bag...
Sadler would just literally be picked off his feet.
Foreman hitting the heavy bag is one of the more prodigious sights
I've had in my life.
It seems to me that of all the people
I've seen hitting heavy bags, including Sonny Liston, no one ever hit it the way Foreman did.
At the end of 15 minutes of pounding the heavy bag, there'd be a hole in the heavy bag... not a hole, but a huge dent the size of half a small watermelon in that tremendous heavy bag, and Foreman used to use the biggest heavy bag around.
What would be interesting is Ali, who would train after Foreman, would often pass by this large hall where the training took place, and he never looked at Foreman hitting the heavy bag.
He just walked right by as if Foreman did not exist.
And it was significant because if you were gonna fight the man, you did not want to see him hitting that heavy bag.
I'm a speed demon! I'm a brain fighter!
I'm scientific! I'm artistic!
I plan my strategy!
He's the bull! I'm the matador!
He's scared to death.
He's scared to death!
He wish he could get out of the whole thing!
He wish he could get out of the whole thing when I look at him.
The man is frightened!
He's meetin' his master, his teacher, his idol!
- Time!
- Is that all?
When I talk and work, I'm in shape.
It's all I do.
Ali had announced he was gonna dance.
He spoke about it all the time.
You couldn't do an interview with Ali during that period where he would say,
"How is Foreman going to get near to me?
I'm going to dance.
I'm going to dance and dance.
That man will look foolish trying to find me.
And as he gropes his way forward in this storm of blindness that's the speed of my dancing,
I will strike him with my jab.
Poo! Poo! Poo!" he would go, and so forth.
We heard this over and over and over, and Foreman heard it too.
Foreman was working now on what's called cutting off the ring.
Now, cutting off the ring essentially just means cornering your opponent against the ropes or in a corner.
And it's an art. It's a balletic art.
You have to have very good footwork.
Foreman's footwork...
He was a big, powerful man, but his footwork was better than anyone expected.
He worked with very fast fighters, smaller than himself, who certainly could dance, and he worked on cornering them.
And he was very good. And we'd watch this.
And the combination of hitting the heavy bag and watching Foreman cut off the ring made most of the fight writers, myself included, terribly pessimistic about Ali's chances.
Yeah, Lord. Now you're working.
The guy threw up his elbows to protect himself from Foreman, and Foreman walked into his elbow.
And he got cut...
That's how he got cut in the eye?
What else can happen that hasn't happened yet?
I saw the man's cut, and this man cannot fight.
This man cannot fight for the world championship.
- You are not a doctor.
- I don't give a damn.
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
The Zaireans kicked us out, and they did not want us around.
And they want the fight to go on.
That's all there is to it.
- That's the problem.
- He won't fight with that eye.
- He's not that dumb.
- He's not that dumb.
That's all you want is a fight.
That's all you want.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
That's all you want is a fight. I know.
I respectfully ask, are the fighters remaining here because they want to remain here, or has the government requested they remain?
Uh, Mr. Sadler told me to convey to the press that it's nothing but an accident.
It's not serious.
They will be getting in touch with the promoters of the fight, and it's possible that we may have to delay the fight, and he will let the press know as soon as possible.
Did they have to stitch Foreman?
They had to stitch him.
Holy shit, man.
So how long is the delay, man?
It'll take another day or two to give any intelligence.
This just happened yesterday.
Then after, we can make a decision.
How does George feel about it?
Well, like anybody else. He's only human.
How would any individual feel?
Does he want to go ahead, or does he want it postponed?
Who? Why should he?
- Why should he go ahead with it, or...
- Why should he make any decision?
Who would know what another man thinks?
How could I truthfully tell you what you would think or what I would think, or how...
A man may have mixed emotions,
I don't know. I couldn't speak for George.
I can only speak for Dick Sadler, not for somebody else.
It would be hard.
I'm not that intelligent.
I don't have that knowledge, that ability to speak what's in another man's mind.
He never discussed it to me, what his thoughts are.
And a person's mind change from time to time.
- But the decision is yours to make?
- The decision is mine to make.
And right now I haven't made any...
I don't have any decisions to make.
Okay, let's get the show on the road.
This meeting is now called to order.
Hear, hear.
The delay won't have any, uh... any effect on the fight at all.
There hasn't been...
There will not be a delay.
The fight will be rescheduled, but when it happens, it'll be actually intended for that time.
Fate intended it for another time.
There is no delay.
How does Ali feel about it?
And if there ever has been any disappointments in sports, any setbacks or rainy days that stopped a ball game, anything, this is the worst of all time.
Initially, Muhammad went through a pretty bad couple of hours, and he first wanted to move the whole fight back to the United States, and when he was told that wouldn't work, he said,
"Well, then let's bring Joe Frazier over here, and I'll fight him again, and instead of each of us getting $5 million,
I'll take 3 million and Joe can take 1 million."
But after a while he calmed down, and he realized that there was nothing that could be done about it except stay in Zaire an extra six weeks and make the best of it.
Now I gotta wait. He's gonna get his whuppin', but I just have to wait.
Boy, I was ready!
I was gonna upset the world again!
The whole world was gonna crawl and bow the next morning!
I was gonna defeat that big, indestructible George Foreman!
Gonna rip him up!
I was gonna get him for a sparring partner.
My dream's all messed up for six more weeks.
The man's in trouble! The man is scared!
He's in my country to start with!
He's in my country. You wanna see?
Want me to show you this is my country?
Ali, bomaye!
Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!
Can you picture 100,000?
Can you picture 100,000?
How you say it? Ali, bomaye!
Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!
Boy, when I hear them brothers hollerin' like that...
Whoo! I'm gonna get my soul and my spirit,
100,000 African brothers hollering "Ali, bomaye!"
And I'm gonna... Ooh!
I'm tired. I can't take it no more.
Let me get out of here.
I gotta get out of here.
I wanna... We gonna...
I'm going up to my room.
I'll talk to y'all later.

The black acts in America have not learned that once their records is off the charts, they're finished.
I mean, they haven't... they haven't learned that.
It's so true.
I heard a speech by Jesse Jackson, saying we must recognize that we're only useful as long as we're necessary.
As long as you're necessary.
When we're not necessary, we're no longer useful,
So they don't realize that your strength comes from your community.
And you have to deal from your strength.
You have to, because in dealing from your strength, you've got somebody.
So if somebody grabs James Brown or want to hurt James Brown, somebody gonna raise their voice and say,
"Why are you bothering my brother?"
Because he's got some soldiers around, somebody that's concerned, that cares.
But when you're dealing as an individual, no matter how big you get, as a black individual, you still a nigger.
You don't care how much money you get.
You are still a nigger.
When you start that by yourself, you are all alone when you become unnecessary.

We left Africa in shackles and fetters and chains.
We're coming back in an aura of splendor and scintillating glory.
The champions are here. So we try to get the champions of the sports world, champions of the music world.
We put 'em together, and we got one champion that's so intermingled and intertwined that we're fused into one entity.
The brother said something there!
Yeah, the brother said something there.
Don King put this together.
It was not a color put it together.
You understand?
I'd like to call him the messiah.
This fight came into existence because of Don King's desire to be famous, to break out of the pack.
It was the world to him. He was either going to become enormously prominent, at the least, in American life, or he was going to go back to obscurity again if it failed.
Oh, I'm so happy to see you, my brother.
Oh, good.
- This is the minister of finance.
- We met before.
Yes, I have met the minister of finance.
How are you?
I recognize and appreciate your talent and your expertise.
This is what it's all about. I welcome you with love. That's all I'm saying.
We must deal with it as such, but with love, you know?
Not with hostility and alienation.
You know? But with love.
Bravo, Mr. King! Bravo!
King had this huge air of welcome.
Rarely has anyone ever been welcomed the way King could do it for you.
There was a joy that came off him.
I knew his reputation, all about him, how he'd been in jail, how he was thoroughly untrustworthy and so forth, but nonetheless, what it was is, he made you feel good.
Don't leave me. I need you.
I need your strength.
He was a startling-looking man.
All the writers used to find different ways of describing this great up-brush of hair.
Some people would say that he'd stuck his thumb into an electric socket.
Falling through an empty elevator shaft.
The fight, of course, was postponed, and Don King turned up, and everybody wanted to know what was going on.
It looked as though maybe the fight wasn't going to happen, and...
Nothing that's as big as this ever runs smoothly anyway.
Anything worthwhile is worth fighting for.
So we have a situation here where we have been struck with adversity.
If you think about what Shakespeare said:
"The sweet uses of adversity, ugly and venomous like the toad, yet wears a precious jewel in his head."
- "Venomous like a..."
- "Ugly and venomous like a toad, yet wears a precious jewel in his head."
How many fight promoters have even tried one line of Shakespeare?
He had a whole raft of them.
I can relate to the denial that they have to be confronted with.
I can relate to the rat-infested hovels, the substandard tenements, the overcrowded tenements.
I can relate to these things because I've been a part of them.
I know about roaches, about rats, so when he started talkin' to me about it,
I can understand him and he can understand me.
You understand? So it's a big difference.
So when I do the thing he can understand, so now he will believe in me because he feels that he has...
I have shared with him the same anguish and anxiety, the same pain that he has felt.
Big difference.
What would happen if you took an enormous... not an enormous, but a small part of the vast sums of money that'll be made out of the fight and put it into something that was... that would help a number of people rather than a few?
This is what my dream and desire is, and I feel that I would need... white counterparts to do this here.
I would say, let me engender a large amount of money, if it's possible, and then don't let this money just be sitting there so that it would wither away and just die, but put it into the sun, so it could be exposed, so it could germinate, blossom and grow.
He's really quite a remarkable man.
Don King is one of the brightest people
I've ever met, he's one of the most charismatic people
I've ever met, he's one of the hardest working people
I've ever met.
He is also totally amoral, and I can't think of a man who has done more to demoralize fighters, exploit from fighters, and ruin fighters' careers than Don King.
But you have to give him his due for what he did to make Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman in Zaire.
And nobody does anything for nothing.
You understand that?
Fight or no fight, what business are we in?
- We're in the music business.
- I was starting to wonder, man.
Because I feel like we're in the fight business these days.

Sucker, you ain't nothin'.
You're too ugly to represent us colored folks.
These Africans make all of us ugly.
Sucker, look at you.
You out, sucker.
Bomaye. Bomaye.
- Ali, bomaye!
- Ali, bomaye!
Ali, bomaye!
- Ali, bomaye!
- That mean "kill him."
When I'm walking down the street, the kids follow me, screaming,
"George Foreman, bumba yu"...
Uh, bomaye, yeah.
And, uh, that hasn't...
I don't think that's so nice to me.
You know, I'd like, if they have any, uh, anything to say about me, they can say, you know,
"George Foreman loves Africa" or "George Foreman loves being here."
Not "George Foreman, kill him."
I don't like that.
- Bomaye!
- Bomaye!
- George Foreman.
- Bomaye! Bomaye!
- That sucker. There he is.
- Bomaye. Bomaye.
You ain't no champ, sucker.
You wasn't nothing!
Even they understand English.
We were all for Muhammad Ali.
Foreman? We didn't know him.
Foreman said, "Why?
I'm black, blacker than Muhammad Ali.
Why all this bias?"
Yes, Muhammad Ali, he was lighter, but he was a real person.
He was genuine.
Muhammad Ali could have been even lighter-skinned than he was, but for us, he was defending the good cause, for Africans and the whole world.
Watch this. Seven punches.
I'm gonna fight for the prestige, not for me but to uplift my little brothers who are sleeping on concrete floors today in America.
Black people who are living on welfare, black people who can't eat, black people who don't know no knowledge of themselves, black people who don't have no future.
I want to win my title and walk down the alleys, sit on the garbage can with the wine-heads.
I want to walk down the street with the dope addicts, talk to the prostitutes.
So I can help a lot of people.
I can show 'em films,
I can take this documentary,
I can take movies and help uplift my people in Louisville, Kentucky;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Cincinnati, Ohio.
I can go throughout Tennessee and Florida and Mississippi and show black Africans in them countries who didn't know this was their country,
"You look like people in Mississippi, in Alabama, in Georgia.
They're your brothers, but they never knew you was over here, and you don't know much about them."
God is blessing me, as an accident through boxing, to help get to all these people and show them films I haven't seen!
I know they haven't seen 'em.
I'm worldly, and I haven't seem 'em!
Now I can get all these films.
You governments can let me take pictures.
You can let me do things, and I can take all this back to America!
But... it's good to be a winner.
All I've got to do is whup George Foreman.
And I realize how unfortunate and how uncomfortable it is for some of you guys to have traveled so far and expecting so much and getting so little.
George Foreman was a phenomenon.
He was almost like a physical guru.
He almost never said anything, but when he did, it was arresting.
You never quite knew what he was talking about.
It might be deep.
It might be non-responsive.
He was negritude.
He was this huge black force.
And because of this, I had expected
Muhammad Ali to be here today.
I was gonna immediately jump and hit him in his mouth to give you some form of entertainment.
Now when I go in the ring, you see what kind of mind I got now?
Oh! Oh!
I just got to pound now.
I mean, I've got to pound it.
I'm not gonna even realize until after.
I might look at his face, say,
"How did I do that?"
Allah, God. I'm his tool.
God got in me on purpose.
This is for my people.
This man look slow. God has made this man look like a little kid.
A so-called right hand ain't nothing now.
I don't even feel 'em.
I ain't got no fear of it.
I walk right in. I'm gonna take my shots.
Because I got God in my mind.
I'm thinking of my people being free.
And I can help with just one fight.
Now he look little in comparison to what
I'm getting from it. He ain't nothin' now.
But if I think about me, just me, and...
George Foreman knocked out
Joe Frazier like he was God.
George Foreman knocked out Ken Norton.
And the white press, the power structure, rank me to get tired in five or six.
Then I go in like Norton and the rest of 'em and get scared.
But I'm not looking at the world and what they say. My God controls the universe.
I was very interested in people called féticheurs.
They are witches, soothsayers, and in Western Africa, almost everybody has one.
Like a witch doctor, and you go the way we would go to a dentist.
Muhammad Ali had been to Mobutu's féticheur.
And, uh... he had said that... the féticheur had said that a woman with trembling hands would somehow get to Foreman.
A succubus.
And that impressed me enormously.
That's the way I confuse that sucker!
The heavyweight championship does produce an excitement in the onlookers that's unlike almost any other spectacle.
It's almost physically unendurable to wait for that bell to ring for the first round.
In 1974 in Zaire, the fight started at 4:00 in the morning, in order that it could be shown on television in America at a reasonable hour like 10:00.
Before the fight,
I saw a scene that was incomparable.
Ali's dressing room was like a morgue.
It was like The Last Supper.
And at a certain point, Ali said...
"Why is everyone... so unhappy?
What is the matter with all of you?"
The sense was, was that we were watching a man who was going out to be... going out to the gallows.
Because they all believed that he was gonna get defeated, and they were terrified.
They thought that, with his pride, he would take one of the world's worst beatings ever, and he wouldn't give up, and he was gonna be destroyed in that ring.
Killed or maimed, or they knew not what.
But they were deeply frightened now.
It was as if they were taking whatever fear Ali might have had before this enormous confrontation, and they were absorbing it.
So after a while, he looked at Bundini and said,
"We're gonna dance tonight, aren't we?
We're gonna dance."
When they said, "You're gonna dance," he said, "I'm gonna dance."
Muhammad Ali was so funny, gracious, repeating this.
"What am I gonna do?"
And they said, "You're gonna dance!"
He said, "Yes! I'm gonna dance and dance!
And that man's gonna be bewildered!
I'm gonna dance and dance!"
And they said, "You're gonna dance!"
And I swear they were all crying.
And he built them up to a degree so that for him they became half-happy.
And here comes the Ali people out of the dressing room, and all of the questions will be answered.
This is an awesome power of George Foreman against the venerated boxing skills of Muhammad Ali.
It's age against youth.
The experience of Muhammad Ali against the youth and brute force and blinding speed.
You can hear the band beginning to strike up in the background as Ali moves to the ring.
This is what Muhammad Ali lives for.
This is the man's life.
This may be an historic event,
Muhammad Ali coming into the boxing ring for the last time.
Should Muhammad Ali retire, this will be, what you're seeing now, a very historic event.
Now here comes the heavyweight champion of the world, George Foreman, jogging out.
George Foreman, decked out in his red robe, coming in with his people.
No one in the press ever saw Mobutu, and he didn't come to the fight.
He watched the fight on closed-circuit.
It was the only closed-circuit in Zaire, and it was in his palace.
He was terribly afraid of assassination,
I think.
Now, this stadium was a true arena for gladiators.
Its floor, the floor you could not see beneath the floor, was covered with blood.
That blood had been washed away, but the effect of the blood was still there as part of the atmosphere.
There was a lot of talk about the possibility of rain.
I don't think the weather could be any more beautiful than it is tonight.
And Ali is getting the people to chant,
"Ali, bomaye."
That means "Ali, kill him."
The atmosphere before the bell rang, before that first round, was as intense as any I ever recall.
Look at this now, as they stare.
Muhammad Ali beginning to talk to George Foreman.
They're really putting the stare on each other.
George Foreman has that serious look.
Ali definitely talking to him.
Look at the stare on George Foreman.
Look at Ali give him the word.
So the stage is set.
We're just about ready to begin round one.
This time, the championship is at stake, and $5 million will be paid to both fighters.
Ali ready, Foreman ready.
We're waiting for the opening bell.
Here we go. Ali quickly across the ring.
Round one. Ali bouncing around, shifting left to right.
George moves slow.
Ali gets the first punch in.
A light right hand taken on the forehead by George Foreman, the champion.
Foreman moving slow, trying to stalk his man.
Ali looks like he's ready to go here.
He's not staying away.
He's going after his man.
Foreman a bit cautious in the first round, looking to drop that left hook.
Foreman's locked his man to the far corner.
There's that left uppercut and jab to the body of Muhammad Ali.
Ali tries to hang on to the head of George Foreman.
Foreman dances now.
Ali with a right-hand lead again!
Has Foreman slightly confused with that right-hand lead, which I haven't seen too many times before.
A right-hand lead, which means that you throw your right without countering...
You throw it first, like a jab, but you throw it like... there... that has to travel that extra distance across the shoulders.
Professionals will very rarely use a right-hand lead
'cause it's a terribly dangerous punch to throw, since you are open to a counter with a left hook.
And fighters, since they work in milliseconds, can see a right coming much faster than a jab.
Nobody had thrown a right-hand lead at Foreman in two years, and in training camp none of his sparring partners, for $50 a day, was gonna start throwing right-hand leads at him because it's a great insult to a top professional when you throw a right-hand lead at him.
It suggests he's slow enough that you can hit him with it.
And instead Ali figured out the one punch Foreman's not prepared for is a right-hand lead.
"He's expecting me to dance.
I'm not gonna dance.
I'm gonna hit him with a right hand, knock him out in the first round."
Ali threw 12 right-hand leads.
I don't think he had told anyone he was gonna do it.
He may have debated about whether he was going to do it up till the last moment.
The only thing is, he didn't knock
Foreman down and didn't knock him out.
Instead, Foreman went crazy.
That punch did no damage. That one did!
Two wild right hands taken on the side of the head of Muhammad Ali!
There's a real strong right hand just underneath the heart.
And Muhammad Ali is taking some punishment now.
About eight seconds left in the round.
Bell rang.
Ali went back to the corner.
Finally, the nightmare he'd been awaiting in the ring had finally come to visit him.
He was in the ring with a man he could not dominate, who was stronger than him, who was not afraid of him, who was gonna try to knock him out, and who punched harder than Ali could punch, and this man was determined and unstoppable.
And Ali had a look on his face that I'll never forget.
It's the only time
I ever saw fear in Ali's eyes.
Ali looked as if he looked into himself and said,
"All right, this is the moment.
This is what you've been waiting for.
This is... that hour.
And do you have the guts?"
And he kind of nodded to himself, like,
"Got to get it together, boy.
You really got to get it together.
And you are gonna get it together.
You will get it together."
He nodded some more, as if he were looking into the eyes of his maker, and then turned to the crowd, and he went,
"Ali, bomaye!"
And a hundred thousand people all yelled back "Ali, bomaye!"
And this huge reverberation of the crowd came back into the ring, and Ali picked it up almost as if,
"These are my people.
This is what I'm here for.
All right. The time has come.
I'm gonna find a way to master this man."
Ali tries to tie him up.
No real damage done in that exchange.
Foreman, like everyone else, had assumed that Ali would dance, and so Ali now went to the ropes and went into the rope-a-dope.
And a lot of people thought at that moment the fight was over.
Especially on television, where they saw it, because it looked like Foreman was now killing a very weak Ali.
You don't go to the ropes.
And there he was, leaning way back.
I wrote about it as if...
I think the phrase I used was,
"It was like a man leaning out a window trying to see if there's something on his roof."
And, you know...
But you couldn't really see.
Here were these great broadsides going at him, and it looked as though he was being set up for the kill.
It happened so quickly and so abruptly that I said, I shouted to Norman,
"The fix is in."
That somehow he's supposed to go down in the first or the second.
Ropes is halfway house to the floor.
It just looked as though he had to cave in.
...awkward but very powerful hooks with both hands.
Left hooks in what would really be...
They became so basic at that point that they were like two kids having a fight.
And for that round and for the next round and for the next round,
Ali lay against the ropes in the rope-a-dope, and he kept talking to Foreman, and it was extraordinary.
You had to be close to see it,
'cause it was intimate.
And Foreman was throwing these prodigious punches that the sparring partners had thrown, and Ali swung like a man in the rigging.
He'd go all the way back, slide out, come in and out like that.
Occasionally he'd get hit, and he'd say,
"George, you disappoint me.
You don't hit as hard as I thought you would.
George, you're not hitting hard enough.
You're not breaking popcorn, George.
You're just not hitting."
And Foreman's insane with rage and wanging at him and wanging at him and wanging at him.
Powerful, powerful, powerful.
And middle of the fifth round,
Foreman was worn out.
He had punched himself out.
It had taken three rounds.
Ali picks it up a bit.
About 40 seconds left in round five.
Good, crisp combination by Ali lands on the head of Foreman.
Foreman with that right hook.
Ali scores a hook!
Quick jab with the right backs up Foreman!
Backs him up in his tracks!
Foreman's stunned here!
Foreman tries the hook!
Ali goes to the right!
Foreman gets knocked to the left!
Foreman hit again!
Foreman has been hit three or four times!
Suddenly Muhammad Ali came off the ropes, and he hit him a right, and you could see the sweat just pour off, just like a fountain, come off Foreman's face, and you suddenly realized there was design in this madness.
I then turned to Norman, I remember, and he must've been somewhat puzzled, but I said, "The succubus has got him," referring back to this woman with the trembling hands that I'd been told by the witch doctors was going to touch Foreman and destroy him.
This could be the tactics of Ali, to let the man punch himself out.
Thirty seconds left in round eight.
A very even fight.
Ali, a sneaky right hand.
Another sneaky right hand.
This time he works over the shoulder of Foreman.
This is the combination!
Two, three, four, five, six!
Foreman gets up to the knee at eight!
That's it! The fight is stopped!
Muhammad Ali, a dramatic eighth-round knockout!
He knocks out...
George Foreman!
He's done it!
Muhammad Ali has done it!
Muhammad Ali has done it!
Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali.
Muhammad Ali, he was like a sleeping elephant.
You can do whatever you want around a sleeping elephant.
Whatever you want.
But when he wakes up, he tramples everything.
Muhammad Ali, bomaye.
Bomaye. Muhammad Ali bomaye
George Foreman.
He did it.
He's champion again.
We couldn't believe it.
It was such a classic performance, and so beautiful, that at the moment
Ali hit the knockout punch...
Foreman began to go,
Ali followed him around.
Ali had his right cocked for one more punch, but he never threw it.
He didn't want to ruin the aesthetic of this man going down with a clumsy punch on the way down.
I think one has mixed emotions when you see the end of a fight.
I always feel enormous sympathy for the man that's losing it.
You just can't help but to, particularly when you see really a titanic, formidable figure just suddenly on the ground.
And now, when we see George on television... and know that after that knockout, he went through two years of the deepest depression, he almost didn't come out of it.
To see the man who's come out of it, to see the way in which he reconstructed his personality, until it'll be hard-put to find anyone in American life who's more affable than George Foreman.
Foreman has become a fabulous person in American life.
Just as the fight finished, the monsoons, the African rains, came, and in fact they came so hard that the waters were about three feet deep in the dressing rooms, where we'd just been, you know, an hour ago.
You've never seen such a downpour.
And we rode back through the African night from the boxing ring into Kinshasa, and there were crowds along the road standing in the rain, in this pouring rain, leaping up and down, because of course the news had gone around that Muhammad Ali had won this fight.
He stayed up all night, from what I heard, and in the morning he spoke to African groups who'd come as delegations to see him.
And they more than revered him.
He was a god.
And he spoke to them very simply that day, and beautifully, and he said,
"Afro-Americans, in America, we're not as good as you are.
Some of us are richer than you are, but you have a dignity in your poverty that we don't have.
We are spoiled in America.
We have lost what you still have in Africa, and you must keep that."
And he spoke very gently. And I thought,
"My Lord, on top of everything else, this man is a political leader, and he's gonna be a great political leader."
I have a lot of things to do in the black neighborhoods.
We have a lot of problems that we have to solve among ourselves.
Prostitution problems, dope problems, gang-fight problems.
Knowledge of self. The black people don't have no knowledge of themselves.
We have been made just like white people mentally.
And white people have made us so much like them until it's hard to teach them anything about themselves.
It's hard to teach them to unite and marry and be with their own because they're now like white people... black people are now like white people.
But they're so brainwashed that we have to re-brainwash 'em now and teach 'em more about themselves and their own history, their own names, their own language, to respect and protect their own women, do something for themselves and quit always begging white people for things they should do for themselves.
I never heard Ali say that he was never gonna fight again.
Uh... if he had said it, and usually he told the truth, I wouldn't have believed it.
He was born to fight, born for the ring, and loved it.
He truly loved fighting. And, uh... as happens with people who love a thing too much, it destroys them.
I think it was Oscar Wilde that said,
"You destroy the thing that you love."
It's the other way around.
What you love destroys you.
He came back. He had 22 fights.
Some of them were most honorable.
Some were very difficult.
Some of them were comedies and farces.
He hurt himself in those 22 fights after the fight in Africa.
There's a tendency to look at Muhammad and say,
"He's wounded. He's ill."
There are no intellectual deficits.
It's a motor-skills problem.
And he doesn't try to hide his condition.
He goes out and lets the whole world see it.
He doesn't feel sorry for himself, and there's really no reason for anybody else to feel sorry for him.
He loves being Muhammad Ali.
He truly believes that he's doing God's work, and he's as happy with each day as anybody I know.
Today's young generation, they don't know anything.
Something happened last year, they know nothing about it.
So there are these great, great stories, great historic events, and I'm not talking about 1850s stuff.
They don't know who Malcolm X is.
They don't know who JFK is.
Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson, you can go down the line.
And-And it's scary.
These kids today will be missing a whole lot if they don't know about the legacy of Muhammad Ali, because no matter what era you live in, you see very few true heroes.
Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!
Ali, bomaye! Ali, bomaye!
Back up, sucker. Back up.
Come get me, sucker. I'm dancin'!
I'm dancin'! Follow me, chump!
No, I'm not there, I'm here. Whoop!

Years after the fight in Zaire, perhaps ten years after... and I'd run into Ali on occasion after that, but I remember this meeting particularly.
'Cause Esquire was giving a party for various people who had distinguished themselves in
Esquire that year in one way or another.
Ali, for whatever he'd done.
I was there probably 'cause I had a good story in Esquire that year.
Other people were there, maybe 25 of us, honored guests.
I was there with my wife, and we saw Ali, and we were talking with him, and he couldn't have been nicer, more complimentary.
I remember I was 62 at the time,
'cause he said, "How old are you now?"
I said "62." He said "Oh."
It was the same as when we were running, jogging that night.
He said, "Oh, I hope I'm as young as you are when I'm 62.
You are looking wonderful."
He went on and on like that.
And I got so pleased and so vain that, you know, I'm like a dog.
What did I have to do?
I had to go urinate.
And I did. I went away, and the moment I was gone, he turned to my wife, who's much younger than I am, and he looked at her, looked at her hard, and he said,
"You still with that old man?"
And for me that's always been...
That's Ali.
You love him even when you turn your back on him.
I heard him once talking to the Harvard senior class commencement.
He gave this extraordinary speech.
You know, he was dyslexic.
And he would look at a paper with me, and he'd say,
"Hey, George, what's this word?"
I'd say, "Appendicitis."
He'd say, "How do you get a word like 'appendicitis'? It's so long.
It's so long."
Here he was, teaching... uh, delivering a lecture, senior class day for these thousand,
2,000 Harvard graduates... and, um, he had these little cards in front of him.
He gave this wonderful speech about, he hadn't had opportunity, but they had, and they should use that language, that learning that they had to go out and do their best to change the world and make it a better place.
It was moving and it was funny at the same time, and a great roar of appreciation at the end of it, and then... someone shouted out, "Give us a poem!"
And everybody quieted down.
The shortest poem in the English language, according to Bartlett's Quotations, is... it's called
"On the Antiquity of Microbes."
And the poem is, "Adam had 'em."
It's pretty short.
But Muhammad Ali's poem was,
"Me, we."
Two words. I wrote Bartlett's Quotations, and I said,
"Look here. That's shorter than
'Adam had 'em.' You want to put it in?"
And it stands for something more than the poem itself.
"Me, we." What a fighter he was.
And what a man.
I want to win my title and walk down the alleys.

She is perhaps Hitler's best-known victim.
Her book has sold more than 25 million copies...
...and has been translated into at least 55 languages.
She's become a symbol of 10 million souls murdered by the Nazis...
...Jews and non-Jews...
...and, in particular, the one and a half million innocent children.
She was just 15 when she died.
A miserable and lonely death in a concentration camp in Germany.
Yet she is remembered for her faith in humanity.
This is the story of the life and legacy of Anne Frank.
In Amsterdam, some of the remnants of a once-thriving Jewish community.
Every person in this congregation, like Jews throughout Europe...
...has a story of their own...
...of persecution, murder, fear or betrayal.
The rabbi spent the first
2 years of his life in hiding...
...sheltered by a Christian family.
But one girl reaches beyond all those memories.
Hers is not just a Holocaust story, for the voice of Anne Frank...
...stands as a warning to those who discriminate on the basis...
...of color, culture or creed.
Her message is as fresh today as it was 50 years ago.
The notorious Nazi propaganda film...
...The Eternal Jew.
Distorted images portraying an Aryan nightmare...
...of the Jewish threat to European civilization.
And this, the family Frank:
Prosperous, cultivated, sophisticated...
...and integrated.
In fact, they were a German family.
German to the core.
The antithesis of ghetto Jews.
Anne's father, Otto, was an officer in the German army...
...in the first World War.
The family had lived in and around
Frankfurt for generations.
But Otto had traveled the world, even working in Macy's store in New York...
...where a college friend,
Nathan Straus, was the owner's son.
In 1925, the 36-year-old Otto married Edith Hollander...
...a 25-year-old Jewish girl from Aachen, Germany...
...near the Dutch border.
They honeymooned in Italy.
Their first daughter, Margot, followed 9 months later...
...and their second, Annelies, better known as Anne, in June 1929.
It was a good life in Frankfurt in those early years.
One could almost forget the long shadow of National Socialism.
But beneath the idyllic surface...
...far removed from the children's world, turmoil.
DANGER JEWS
Their landlord turned out to be a Nazi party member.
And in March 1931, they moved.
The bank owned by the family also had serious problems...
...resulting in its complete collapse in 1933...
...caused by Otto's brother being the victim of a fraud...
...and the effects of the Depression, particularly acute in Germany.
And, of course, the threat of the gathering storm.
On the streets...
...at the rallies...
ONE RACE ONE NATION
...and finally in January 1933...
...the ballot box.
ONE LEADER
For it is often forgotten that Hitler gained power in a democratic election.
For the Franks, the German dream was over.
Some of the family had moved to Switzerland.
Otto chose to try his luck in Holland...
...where he had prior business connections.
In autumn 1933, the family settled here in Merwedeplein...
...a modern housing development in South Amsterdam.
They established a settled and full existence amongst German refugees...
...and Dutch neighbors.
We moved into the same neighborhood as the Frank family.
Many other refugees moved there.
And so there was a little bit of a German-Jewish enclave...
...by no means a ghetto, but just a little enclave.
Quite often parents would speak
German in the street...
...which annoyed us children terribly, of course.
Hanneli Goslar
My father was a deputy minister in the interior.
And he was the chief of the press in Germany.
He had really a very high position.
And he immediately fled...
...when the whole government stepped down.
And, okay, we went to England before...
...but he didn't find a job where he didn't have to work Shabbat.
And so we stopped here in Merwedeplein.
Life for Jewish refugees...
...as I experienced it as a young child, in a way had its charms.
What I particularly enjoyed was that we adapted faster than our parents.
Our parents had to turn to us and ask us...
...what's done in this country.
And I found this tremendously democratizing.
I really enjoyed that part very much.
The Franks formed an active social life amongst the other refugee families.
For visitors, Anne's behavior made the Sunday gatherings...
...something of an ordeal.
She was just what you could call naughty.
She had to sit on a table where everything was very beautiful...
...in a beautiful dress and have her chocolate not spoil it.
Isa Baschwitz
She just didn't want to.
She got up and she made fuss, and she...
...drew attention.
And then she grew angry.
And that angriness...
...that was the problem between the parents.
Mother Frank said, "You sit down. "
And Father Frank said:
"Leave the child alone.
She's so small and she's so little. "
So she was allowed to do the things she wanted.
And that happened every time.
Every time that girl was naughty...
...was impertinent, later on, really impertinent.
I remember very strongly that Mr. Frank...
...was seen as an ideal daddy, that he was the daddy...
...because he was so much involved in his girls' education.
He fixed his wife breakfast on Sunday morning and brought it to her bedside...
...which was unheard of in our circles.
So that news made the round:
"Mr. Frank does this for his wife!
How great. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
We left Germany in 1933...
...because I didn't want to educate my children with blinkers.
They were not allowed to see
Christian friends anymore.
In Holland, it was different.
Upon her arrival in Amsterdam...
...the 4-year-old Anne was sent to the Montessori school...
...where Lies Goslar became her best friend.
Years later, in her diary,
Anne wrote this of Lies:
"Hanneli Goslar, or Lies, as she's called at school, is a bit strange.
She's usually shy...
...outspoken at home but reserved around other people.
She blabs whatever you tell her to her mother.
But she says what she thinks.
And lately, I've come to appreciate her a great deal. "
Anne and Lies' friendship had begun on their very first day at school.
Exactly in opposite of the door...
...I saw the back of Anne, and she was ringing these little bells.
And she turned around, and she saw me,
I saw her, and hop...
...we run each into the arms of another.
I think my mother went away.
I didn't look at her anymore.
And this was the first day.
Since then we were together really till the end.
Of the two sisters, I was really more impressed with Margot than with Anne...
...for rather obvious reasons.
Margot was a year and a half older than I am, so she was a model.
She was ladylike.
She was always composed.
She always did her homework.
She was just the ideal young lady.
I was a tomboy, so I always thought it would be great to be like Margot.
Anne was very lively, and I didn't need any model for that.
I was lively myself.
Besides, she was younger. You never model yourself after a younger child.
So I know her-
All the time.
I could do that just as well.
I will start with the sentence my mother said always.
My mother said, "God knows everything.
Anne knows everything better. "
This describes Anne, you understand?
I don't know in English...
She knew everything better.
Anne was- In America you say "spicy. "
A spicy girl.
She always was friendly with the boys.
The boys liked her.
The girls liked her. She also always was in the center of the thing.
Then she had something I never saw, not before and not afterwards.
She could take out the socket out of the shoulder...
...and she would sit, and everybody looked.
And then she made out, and knock, knock, knock.
You have to be very careful. You can end up with an orthopedic doctor.
She liked it, and everybody was looking at her. And then she was happy.
When he came to Holland, Otto Frank set up the Opekta Company...
...a Dutch subsidiary of a German concern, selling pectin...
...a substance used in making jam.
The progressive Otto had a film produced to promote the product.
In the early days, he had four key colleagues, all non-Jews.
One of those employees was an Austrian who'd grown up in Holland.
Miep Gies.
It was a very fine place to work...
...because we understand all the people in the office.
We were very close, was friendly together.
He was always our boss...
...but also our father.
We can go to Mr. Frank with all our troubles and sorrow.
The office boy and general helper from 1933 until 1939...
...was Henk van Beersekamp.
Mrs. Frank was different from Otto Frank.
Otto Frank was a familiar, friendly man...
...who treated me as an equal...
...and with kindness.
Mrs. Frank was a bit...
...well, maybe she had been accustomed...
...to better things in life in Germany.
I don't know.
Margot was a bit subdued...
...but Anne was a dear.
I had lots of fun with her...
...because we would make funny faces...
...which she found amusing.
I remember one time I did this:
And she always split her sides with laughter.
And when I did that, her tongue...
...would move to and fro.
But it was fun.
She was a great girl.
Dutch Nazis putting on a show in Amsterdam in 1938.
Though Hitler had infiltrated the police, the civil service...
...even the prime minister...
...in the years before the war, Holland...
...was generally good to its Jewish refugees from Germany.
Despite these scenes of Fascist collaborators...
...the Dutch and German Jews believed that they would be safe in Holland...
...far from the Führer in their former homeland.
Few, very few, tried to leave for safer shores.
And Otto and his family were not amongst them.
Sometimes I said to Mr. Frank:
"You must go out of the Netherlands.
It will be danger for you. "
Miep Gies
"No," said he.
"In the first World War, the German came not here in the Netherlands.
So they come the second time, also not. "
And I said to him,
"You must go to America. "
"No, I stay here because I love the Netherlands. "
The faith of Otto Frank and thousands like him...
...was catastrophically misplaced.
By May 1940, Hitler had conquered almost all of Europe.
Austria, Poland, Norway, Denmark...
...Yugoslavia, Greece,
Romania, Bulgaria...
...and most of France had fallen to
Germany's air force and storm troops.
Europe's low countries remained as a tantalizing morsel...
...to be swallowed whole.
Then by the 14th of May, 1940, it was all over.
Five days after the Germans had finally...
...smashed through Holland's borders, the Dutch capitulated.
In Amsterdam, Hitler's victory was greeted with black humor.
My father made himself look like Hitler.
It was wonderful how he did it.
Here was the hair and the black mustache.
The Franks lived next door, and he would ring at the door and come in.
I remember them all, you know, the first moment.
They were very frightened what happened.
If you could think Hitler didn't come to their house.
But it was very funny how everybody was frightened at the moment...
...till they...
...till they saw who it was and what happened.
What happened to your father?
He died in Bergen-Belsen.
The German vice tightened gradually.
First they conducted a hearts-and-minds campaign to win over the Dutch...
...their Aryan brothers.
THANK ADOLF HITLER
JEWISH QUARTER
For the Jews, it was another story...
...as their freedom was gradually restricted...
...by a never-ending series of anti-Jewish decrees...
...already familiar in Germany and other conquered territories.
JEWS PROHIBlTED
By 1942...
...no area of Jewish life was excluded from German control.
Jews Prohibited
By Law
Everything that was fun in life was forbidden.
We were not allowed to go anymore to a park or to a swimming pool.
We were not allowed to go to shops.
Only to Jewish shops and only between 3 and 5.
8:00 in the evening you had to be at home.
You had to wear the star.
You had to have something with you that would look if you are Jewish or not...
...even if you had the star.
Then things were-
You were frightened.
You just wouldn't go out.
To school and home, and that's it, yes.
How one of the friends of Anne said:
"Everything I did, I was afraid it is forbidden. "
Well, the effect of these restrictions...
...was, I think, mainly...
...because it came inch by inch, very slowly.
"If that's all, we can bear it. "
We always had a stiff upper lip, and we tried to make the best of it.
If you can't go to public school anymore...
...there are good Jewish teachers.
If you can't go to concerts, which was important in my family...
...there are fine Jewish musicians, so we make music at home.
So we always tried to put the best spin...
...on whatever happened.
And that way, I think, we tried to ward off...
...thinking about how we were being more restricted...
...and what was going to be sure to come afterwards.
Otto Frank, always the perfect father...
...rented movies to show the girls on the living room wall.
Rin Tin Tin was a particular favorite with Anne.
She and her friend Jacqueline van
Maarsen created a cinema of their own.
Together we made little cards to get in.
Of course, everybody could come in, but we wanted to make it look real...
...by making these little tickets.
"Jacqueline van Maarsen...
...is invited on Sunday, the 1st of March...
...with Anne Frank, Merwedeplein 37...
...for...
...a movie.
Without this card, no entrance.
Please inform in time. Row 2.
Seat 2."
THE LIGHTHOUSE BY THE SEA
WITH RIN TIN TIN
This film supplied the entertainment for Anne and her friends...
...when they celebrated her 13th birthday...
...her last in freedom.
Her prized gift that 13th birthday...
...on Friday, the 12th of June, 1942...
...was her diary...
...a present she had bought with her father a few days before.
From the beginning, Anne addressed her diary as a special friend...
...with whom she would conduct a secret correspondence.
Her first entry was this:
"I hope I will be able to confide everything to you...
...as I have never been able to confide in anyone.
And I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. "
Her early diary jottings were typical of a 13-year-old:
Gossip about school friends, jokes...
...and a record of her unextraordinary daily life...
...together with photos and other scraps.
In the years that followed, she also shared her most intimate secrets...
...including her increasing interest in the development of her body and in sex.
What interested Anne very much was sexual behavior...
...and she wanted to know what it was all about.
Jacqueline "Jopie" van Maarsen
And she asked her father about it.
I knew much more than she did...
...because I had my sister, who told me everything.
So I thought, "Well, I'm not going to enlighten you altogether.
You just ask your father. "
At the time, Anne's body was not changing yet.
And I think that she was curious...
...because she had some little...
She used a bra from Margot with cotton wool in it...
...to show a bit of breast.
And I did not need that kind of thing...
...and she was interested to see exactly...
While Anne was innocently absorbed with her developing body...
...Otto Frank was mindful that if the Nazi measures against Jews...
...continued to their inevitable conclusion...
...he and his family would need to take precautions to protect themselves.
For a year, he had been secretly preparing a hiding place for them all...
...together with his German business associate Hermann van Pels...
...van Pels' wife, Auguste, and son, Peter.
It was to be in several rooms behind the company offices on Prinsengracht...
...in central Amsterdam.
Laboriously, and unknown to all but the innermost circle...
...Otto accumulated furniture, cooking implements...
...bedding and clothes.
At the Frank home, two and a half miles away in Merwedeplein...
...Sunday, the 5th of July, 1942, was the day that everyone had dreaded...
...had hoped against hope would never come.
That Sunday, the Germans delivered...
...this innocuous document by registered mail...
...to several thousand Jews, the majority of them of German extraction...
...aged between 15 and 40.
They were to report within 9 days to be transported to a labor camp...
...in Germany.
Margot Frank was one of them...
...throwing her family, like so many, into crisis.
The agonies at that moment were when you had some youngsters saying:
"Labor won't floor me. I'm strong.
I can do whatever's asked of me.
I'm going and that's it. "
And the parents would say, "No, stay.
It's going to be the end of your life. "
So you saw the family in tension.
Then you had other families where a youngster would say:
"I don't want to go. I'm scared. What will happen?" The parents would say:
"You must go. Remember, grandmother lives with us and the baby.
If you don't go, we'll be punished. "
And you saw the families really...
...torn asunder by these events.
And that was terrible.
Nine years after fleeing Germany, the Franks were on the run again.
By 7:30 on Monday, the 6th of July, 1942...
...the whole family had disappeared...
...leaving behind an elaborate false trail...
...indicating they had fled to Switzerland.
We came here...
...and the kitchen was not...
The kitchen was just left like it was...
...with everything dirty in the sink.
I went into her room, and I saw her bed not made.
And the shoes that she loved, she'd just received them for the summer...
...were near the bed.
I came here, you see.
I went up, and I am ringing and ringing and ringing...
...and nobody opens.
And at the end somebody opened.
It was a tenant. Mr. Goudschmidt.
He had the room at the roof in the Frank apartment.
He looked at me as if he'd never seen me before.
And I didn't know what happened.
He said, "What do you want?"
"I come to play as usual. " And he said:
"Yes, but don't you know? The Frank family left for Switzerland. "
Miep Gies had been given the responsibility of getting Margot...
...who was now in flight from the Germans, to the hiding place.
I took Margot by bicycle.
Monday morning, very raining.
And that was good for us because the German...
...came not on street.
And I came with her to the Prinsengracht 263...
...go up with her.
She was very...
-Upset?
-Yes. She was very upset.
I saw it.
And when I was standing with her in front of the hiding place...
...I was afraid that she would...
...fall down.
And what could I do with her?
I opened the door and put her in.
Despite Otto's carefully laid plans...
...on their first day there, the family was surrounded by chaos.
When I come there, it was terrible.
Nothing was okay.
And Mrs. Frank and Margot were sitting down on the bed.
They could not do anything.
There was...
They couldn't accept this situation.
But Anne and Mr. Frank were busy, very busy.
I ask Mrs. Frank,
"Can I do something for you?"
"No," said Mrs. Frank.
"For today, I have all the things. "
And then I went down.
But the next day, when I came, all was okay.
-So Anne and Mr. Frank-?
-Were busy the whole day.
Was this typical of the family?
Yes. That was typical for the family.
Now the family was dependent on Otto Frank's four employees...
...who had volunteered to help them survive.
Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler supplied Anne and Margot...
...with school books and other reading matter...
...at the same time, ensuring the Opekta
Company continued to function...
...even producing record profits that could be used to keep everyone alive.
Miep Gies and her assistant, the 23-year-old typist, Bep Voskuijl...
...had the dangerous task of supplying the residents of the annex with food...
...purchased on the black market or with forged or stolen ration books.
In one of her first diary entries in hiding...
...Anne described her new home to her imaginary friend:
"Thursday, July 9, 1942.
Dear Kitty:
Our secret annex is at the back of the building.
There's just one small step in front of the door, and then you're inside.
Straight ahead of you is a steep flight of stairs.
To the left is a narrow hallway opening onto a room...
...that serves as the Frank family's living room and bedroom.
Next door is a smaller room:
The bedroom and study of the two young ladies of the family.
To the right of the stairs is a windowless washroom with a sink.
The door in the corner leads to the toilet...
...and another one to Margot's and my room.
If you go up the stairs and open the door at the top...
...you're surprised to see such a light and spacious room...
...in an old canal house like this.
It contains a stove and a sink.
This will be the kitchen and bedroom for Mr. and Mrs. van Pels...
...as well as the general living room, dining room and study for us all.
A tiny side room is to be
Peter van Pels' bedroom.
Then just as in the front part of the building...
...there's an attic and a loft. "
As they settled into their confinement, the chimes of the Westerkerk clock...
...seemed to act as a constant reminder of the world they had left behind them.
Before long, the entrance to the hiding place was disguised...
...as a bookcase.
But in every respect, what lay behind those innocuous files...
...was untypical of the shelter provided to other Jews.
It was relatively spacious, within a city.
There were people outside dedicated to helping and protecting them.
Most families were torn apart...
...but here, all four of the Franks could stay together.
A week later, they were joined by their friends the van Pelses.
Miep Gies visited each day.
When I came here from this door...
...in the middle was standing the table with the chairs.
All the people, seven people...
...were standing in the line here.
Did not say any word.
Did not say any word...
...but waited for me to begin.
It was always an awful moment for me...
...because I felt the dependence...
...from these people of us, the helpers.
Except Anne. Anne was in the front.
She asked, "Hello, Miep, what is the news?"
In those early months,
Anne was desperately lonely...
...and always hoping for news of her friends.
She even invented a correspondence with one of them.
"September 25, 1942.
Dear Jacqueline:
I'm writing this letter in order to bid you goodbye.
I can't write to everyone, and that's why I'm just writing to you.
I'd be grateful if you'd be really nice...
...and keep up a secret correspondence with me.
All inquiries to Mrs. Gies.
I hope we'll meet again soon...
...but it probably won't be before the end of the war.
Well, then, Jackie,
I hope things go well with you...
...and that I hear from you soon.
Your best friend, Anne.
P. S.:
I hope that we'll always stay best friends until we meet again.
Bye. "
I think that she wrote it immediately...
...after she went into hiding.
And afterwards, at that moment in September, she wrote it down.
She invented in that my answer to her.
And then she wrote a second letter...
...in answer to this invented letter.
And she must have been very lonely that she invented these letters.
Anne also wrote a long fantasy in which she imagined living with her cousin...
...in the safety of Switzerland.
When I think that when Anne wrote about Switzerland and about me...
Bernd Elias
...it must have been a painful thought to her...
...to realize that she was like a bird in a cage...
...and we, over here in Switzerland...
...were free to do anything we wanted to do.
And all her dreams...
...were caged in.
And we, the boys, her cousins...
...could fulfill everything she was dreaming of.
It must have been a very, very hard thing for her.
In the diary, she even designs a skating dress...
-... so she can be your skating partner.
-Yes.
Yes, when I saw that the first time...
...it really overwhelmed me.
It made me cry, to be very honest.
Especially then that I knew she was not alive anymore when I saw it.
I would have loved to go skating with her.
Anne also addressed her diary entries to a circle of imaginary friends...
...all characters from a well-known series of books for adolescent girls.
Eventually, she settled on one friend, Kitty...
...as her diary correspondent.
Anne was always a very curious child.
When I was upstairs and went away...
...she'd always wait till the last to speak with me.
And then she had me.
And she asked everything what happened outside.
And I told her the truth.
The terrible truth.
"November 19, 1942.
Dearest Kitty:
Countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a dreadful fate.
Night after night, green and gray military vehicles...
...cruise the streets.
In the evenings, when it's dark...
...I often see long lines of good, innocent people...
...accompanied by crying children, walking on and on.
No one is spared.
The sick, the elderly, children...
...babies and pregnant women all are marched to their death.
I get frightened when I think of close friends who are now at the mercy...
...of the cruelest monsters to stalk the earth.
And all because they're Jews. "
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Margot's classmate
At the beginning of the class of '41, we had about 50 children.
The deportations began in July '42.
And then from 50 children...
...all the time, children disappeared.
When you came in your class, you said:
"That child's missing and that one and that one. "
You did hope they were ill.
But you knew that they were round up...
...or maybe they were hidden.
At the end of the school year...
...in April '43...
...there were three children left...
...two boys and I.
And we did our final examination...
...together.
The second part of the final examination, I was alone.
It was very sad.
Very difficult.
From 50 children, one remained at the end of the year?
While the roundups of their friends continued outside...
...in their hiding place,
Anne and the others...
...tried to establish a kind of normality.
"Dear Kitty:
Up to now, our bedroom with its blank walls was very bare.
Thanks to Father, who brought my entire...
...post card and movie star collection here beforehand...
...and to a brush and a pot of glue...
...I was able to plaster the walls with pictures. "
We were both collecting pictures...
...from the children of the queen.
Here you see Elizabeth, today Queen Elizabeth...
...and her sister Margaret.
And I also was collecting, and we would change together.
We had from Belgium...
From all the queens in the world, we would change pictures.
I liked it very much. Anne was also collecting from film stars.
This I wasn't interested in at all.
I only remember she had
Deanna Durbin. This one.
This is the only one I remember from then. I never saw a film.
I don't remember if Anne saw films.
We went to see Shirley Temple films.
And here in Amsterdam, we had a cinema, Cineac.
There you could see one hour a little film and news.
And then it started.
Over there, we would go very often.
Four months after going into hiding, an 8th person joined the annex...
...a 54-year-old German dentist,
Fritz Pfeffer.
Margot slept on a folding bed with her parents.
And Anne had to share her room with the newcomer.
Look, Mr. Pfeffer was my dentist.
And Mr. Pfeffer asked me always:
"Miep, do you have a place for me?"
Then I went next day...
...in the hiding place and tell it to Mr. Frank and the other peoples.
They listened to me.
Next day, Mr. Frank said:
"Miep, where seven people can eat...
...can eight also eat. "
Pfeffer moved into Anne's bedroom...
...complete with his drill and dental implements.
While no one would now lack treatment of their cavities...
...relations between the 54-year-old disciplinarian...
...and the free spirit in her early teens...
...were inevitably stormy.
On this corner...
...it was the desk...
...for Anne...
...and Pfeffer.
There this...
This gave sometimes troubles with Anne.
Anne was standing on her rights.
From so till so is her time.
But I believe Mr. Pfeffer...
...did not see the importance of a diary...
...for a little child.
"Him and his lies.
I'll smack his ugly mug so hard, he'll go bouncing off the wall.
Anyone who is so petty and pedantic at the age of 54 was born that way...
...and is never going to change. "
What Anne never knew was that Fritz Pfeffer had a son...
...whom he had raised as a single parent in Germany...
...until sending him to England after Kristallnacht in 1938.
A few weeks later, Pfeffer himself fled to Amsterdam...
...with his fiancee, Charlotte.
But his 11-year-old son never saw his father again.
Peter Pepper
Fritz Pfeffer's son
We're talking about a girl under very difficult circumstances...
...who first of all decided that my father was not a nice man.
Therefore, she called him Dr. Dussel, which in English is "idiot. "
As far as my point of view...
...retrospectively to the age of 11 and below...
...there's a very large inaccuracy.
First of all, my father, although being a very strict man...
...was a very kind man.
What other people don't recognize...
...is his love of life, his love of freedom.
My father was a sportsman.
He loved to row.
He loved to ride horses.
He liked to climb mountains.
So if you take a man who's always been active all his life...
...and then in flight he ends up here...
...it's like caging a bird.
Weekly, Mrs. Miep Gies would bring a package containing letters...
...and other personal messages from Charlotte Karletta.
And weekly, she would take a letter from him to her.
What do you feel now about what that may have meant for your father?
What it meant for my father...
...is that it is a thin lifeline.
A thin lifeline that was the only hope of expression...
...and relationship.
Because with Charlotte's letters to him...
...expressing her love, her feelings...
...her news, whatever it was in those letters...
...is the only thing where my father would have...
...the semblance of mental health.
Because you're a prisoner of your own mind.
For the first time, Fritz Pfeffer's son meets his father's protector.
Mr. Pfeffer.
How do you do?
Fine.
I was a very good friend of your father.
Do you understand German?
I came into contact with him every day.
He was my dentist, exceptionally good.
He asked me if I could help him...
...find a place, and so I helped him.
Unbelievable.
Nice to meet you.
He was a lovely, lovely man.
Do you speak English?
Very bad.
Shall we try German?
Yes, if that's okay, it would be better.
What would you like to know?
I just want to say...
...two words.
Many thanks.
Two months after this meeting,
Peter Pepper died of cancer.
If Anne reserved her special venom for Fritz Pfeffer...
...with the claustrophobia of the months in hiding that turned into years...
...all the adults at one time or another were subjected to the fury of her pen.
"September 27, 1942.
Some people, like the van Pelses, take delight not only...
...in raising their own children...
...but in helping others raise theirs.
Margot doesn't need it since she is naturally good...
...kind and clever, perfection itself.
But I seem to have enough mischief for the two of us.
More than once, the air's been filled with the van Pels' admonitions...
...and my saucy replies.
They tell me I should talk less, mind my own business and be more modest.
But I seem doomed to failure. "
Otto, the ever-indulgent father, was frequently called in...
...to act as a peacemaker between Anne and the others.
Her adoration of him was matched only by her increasing problems...
...with her mother.
"I cling to Father because my contempt of Mother is growing daily.
And it is only through him that I'm able to retain...
...the last ounce of family feeling I have left.
I don't know how I should act.
I can't very well confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm...
...and her hard-heartedness.
Yet I can't continue to take the blame for everything.
I'm the opposite of Mother, so of course we clash.
She's not a mother to me.
I have to mother myself.
I'm charting my own course and will see where it leads me. "
Mrs. Frank was the most depressed of all the people.
Sometimes when I go out of the hiding place...
...the staircase downstairs...
...she went with me till the door.
I did not understand that.
What did she want of me?
And once again, I go with her in her sleeping room...
...and she closed the door, and then she said to me:
"Miep...
...I am so afraid. "
She told me all her troubles.
But what could I do?
I didn't say anything...
...because I was in the same position as she.
While Anne and her mother feuded...
...in the second year, she developed a strong passion for Peter van Pels...
...the 17-year-old boy with whom she shared her caged existence.
They spent hours together in the loft chatting...
...or simply staring out the window at the chestnut tree.
"Sunday, March 19, 1944.
I have the feeling that Peter and I share a secret.
When he looks at me with those eyes, with that smile and with that wink...
...it's as if a light goes on inside me.
I hope things stay like this...
...and we'll have many, many more happy hours together.
Your grateful and happy Anne. "
Peter van Pels was a blue-eyed boy...
...with very little intellectual capacity.
I didn't know him nearly as well as I knew Anne.
But he once came to our house when we were reading the classics...
...and he was so singularly bewildered by it...
...that I remember thinking:
"My goodness, he doesn't know a thing!"
The relationship with Peter waxed and then waned.
They cuddled and kissed, but as she noted in her diary...
...Anne gradually became dissatisfied...
...with his inability to express his feelings.
The pressures of confinement created and then crushed...
...their adolescent love affair.
In the secret annex, the claustrophobia was stifling.
The radio, broadcasting from England...
...was an essential lifeline to news from the outside world.
Every Allied victory brought hope, every defeat, gloom.
Arguments over food blew up into major rows.
And then always the ever-present threat of discovery.
The windows had to be covered by blinds, even in the heat of summer.
The toilet could only be used outside office hours.
No one could walk in shoes on the lower floor...
...for fear that the workers in the warehouse below would hear.
And always the question,
"Would they be betrayed...
...or would they betray themselves by some inadvertent error?"
To add to everyone's fears...
...the warehouse and offices under their hiding place were burgled a few times.
My father had the maintenance of the building, the daily maintenance.
Hans Wijnberg
Later I recognized that he must have been the carpenter...
...that's repairing the door...
...which is opened by the burglary in the book, in Anne Frank's diary.
I think there were two burglaries, weren't there?
Yeah. The other one was me.
What were you after?
I think it's a mixture of adventure and spices.
We found some spices.
But we had to move out...
...because we recognized people living in the house...
...because they made a mistake upstairs.
That's what I later realized.
I didn't know it was the Frank family.
We did not know.
We were not supposed to know who was living in a house...
...because of what I explained earlier.
You didn't speak about people living somewhere.
So we heard them flushing the toilet...
...so we moved out because that was a sign people were upstairs.
And well, we were not there with an agreement of anybody.
"Wednesday, March 29, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
Mr. Bolkestein, the cabinet minister...
...speaking on the Dutch broadcast from London...
...said that after the war, a collection would be made of diaries and letters...
...dealing with the war.
Of course, everyone pounced on my diary.
Imagine how interesting it would be if I published a novel...
...about the secret annex.
The title alone would make people think it was a detective story.
Seriously though,
10 years after the war...
...people would find it very amusing to read how we lived...
...what we ate and what we talked about as Jews in hiding. "
For 6 weeks, Anne thought constantly about the message from London.
Then she made up her mind.
She had wanted to be a journalist, a famous writer, to travel the world...
...see Paris and Hollywood.
This was her opportunity.
Starting in the middle of May 1944...
...she began to furiously rewrite her whole diary from the first entry...
...with a view to future publication...
...at the same time as keeping up her regular diary entries.
"Tuesday, June 6, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
'This is D-day, ' the BBC announced at 12.
'This is the day.
The invasion has begun. '
A huge commotion in the annex.
Is this really the beginning of the long-awaited liberation?
The liberation we've all talked so much about...
...which still seems too good, too much of a fairy tale ever to come true?
Will this year, 1944, bring us victory?
We don't know yet.
But where there's hope, there's life.
It fills us with fresh courage and makes us strong again.
The best part of the invasion...
...is that I have the feeling that friends are on the way.
Those terrible Germans have oppressed and threatened us for so long...
...that the thought of friends and salvation...
...means everything to us.
Maybe, Margot says...
...I can even go back to school...
...in October or September. "
With the Allies advancing, the spirits in the annex soared.
Otto Frank kept a map...
...tracking every advance of the British and American troops.
But the odds were stacked against those in the hiding place.
Of the 25,000 Jews who hid from the Nazis in Holland during WWII...
...some 8 to 9 thousand were discovered by the Germans...
...or betrayed by their Dutch hosts.
Many of the Franks' neighbors, some of whom were known Nazi sympathizers...
...knew there was something going on in the back house...
...at 263 Prinsengracht.
Anyone could've called the authorities to collect the reward...
...for betraying Jews in hiding.
Anne herself chronicled many acts of carelessness...
...that could've led to the suspicion that could easily lead on to betrayal.
It has never been proved how they were betrayed...
...but on a sunny summer morning in 1944...
...two years after they first stepped behind their secret door...
...their world collapsed.
It was the 4th of August...
You know, it was always my task to go first...
...up in the hiding place.
Also this day.
I go up, took my shopping list...
...talked with the people...
...and came down.
After an hour, I was working in the office.
Bep in front of me,
Koophuis on this side.
The door...
...goes open, but I did not look.
And it was quiet.
In a moment, I look up...
...and there was a man standing before me with a gun to me...
...and said:
"Quiet. No words. "
Was there ever a plan...
...for this sort of situation?
No. No.
We were so...
...sure that it never would happen.
The authorities were alerted by an anonymous phone call...
...that there were Jews hiding in the Opekta offices.
Four Dutch policemen from the German security service...
...led by an Austrian officer, went straight to the secret bookcase.
I could hear the voice of the Nazi.
And I heard this man...
...speak with a...
...with a Vienna accent.
And if you know, I'm born in Vienna.
I know that accent.
I stand up and say to him...
...in a nearly friendly mien:
"You are a Vienna.
I'm a Vienna too. "
And this one sentence...
...was perhaps too much for this man.
He was standing there...
...looked at me.
And when he come to him-
He come to me...
...so near to me that I feel his...
...his adem.
His breath, I feel his breath.
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself...
...helping Jewish baggage?
You deserve to receive...
...the worst punishment.
And you know what that is. "
I did not say any word.
I was...
He was going in my office from the one wall to the other...
...as a wild...
...animal.
Animal.
After a while, he stood still...
...looked me a little friendlier.
"Out of personal sympathy, you may stay...
...but woe betide you if you flee.
Then we'll take your husband. "
When the Germans captured
Jews in hiding...
...they looted everything of value.
Officially, this was meant to finance the transportation of the Jews...
...to the Polish death camps.
But corruption was rife...
...and Jewish valuables often lined the pockets of Nazi policemen.
Needing a container for his loot...
...the Austrian arresting officer, SS
Oberscharführer Karl Silberbauer...
...emptied the contents of Otto
Frank's briefcase onto the floor.
And thus, he left behind
Anne's diary.
After the Franks and the other peoples were away...
...I come here in...
...and found...
...the diary scattered on the floor.
Ellie and me, Bep and me.
Bep and me, we saw this.
"That is the diary of Anne!"
"Please take! Take it!"
We took all the things...
...but I was afraid...
...that I had not all the paper of the diary. I knew that.
But I was so in hurry...
...because I was afraid that this Austrian man came again.
-That the officer-
-That the officer...
Because he say,
"I come back. "
Within two weeks of Miep Gies saving Anne's diary...
...the Dutch firm of A-Puls stripped the hiding place of its possessions...
...to be sent to Germany to aid bombed-out German civilians.
Silberbauer and his assistants had taken the eight Jewish prisoners...
...to Gestapo headquarters, housed here in a former school in Amsterdam.
Of the helpers, Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler were also arrested.
Though not the two women,
Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl.
Kleiman and Kugler were then sent here...
...to Amersfoort labor camp in Holland...
...shown in this film during a Dutch Red Cross inspection.
Kleiman was released in September due to bad health...
...and Kugler managed to escape in 1945...
...when the train in which he...
...was being transported to Germany was bombed by American planes.
The day after the arrest of the Franks, the van Pelses and Pfeffer...
...Miep tried one last desperate effort to help them.
I go to the Gestapo.
And when you dare go in...
...you did not know if you come out.
I found this Austrian man...
...and he said, "Yes, come. "
I went to him.
But when I came there, his office was full of young people.
Secretaries and all the peoples.
But he was sitting in the corner.
And when I came in, I could not-
I think...
..."I cannot speak with this man what I want. "
So I go to the corner to him...
...over his desk, and I did so:
"Understand me," I said to him.
"Please come back tomorrow.
I can't do anything more for you today. "
And then I went away.
Next morning, I go to him.
He was standing in the door...
...waiting for me.
"I am sorry," he said to me.
"I can't do anything for you...
...because I am not high enough.
You understand me?"
And I said to him,
"I don't believe you. "
"Go to my boss. "
And I go upstairs.
I knocked on the door.
Nobody said anything.
Then I opened the door, and what did I see?
A large table...
...sitting high German people.
Their caps on the table, and in the middle...
...the radio, listening to England.
That was very, very-
Was not allowed for the German people.
And it was very dangerous for me...
...because I saw what they did.
And I said, "Who is he, the boss?"
One man came to me, pushed me out of the door.
"You are a swine. "
And then I went down.
And this Vienna man was standing in the door.
I said, "What did I say to you?"
And then I went down...
...and I feel...
...the curtain of this play was fallen for me.
Afterfour days in the cellars of the Gestapo building...
...the prisoners were taken to the Amsterdam railway depot.
They were loaded under guard onto an ordinary passenger train.
Janny Brilleslijper, a member of the Dutch Resistance...
...was amongst the prisoners.
What I saw was a family.
There were a number of people...
...a very worried father and a nervous mother...
...and two children...
...wearing sports clothes, I believe.
Of course, it is more than fifty years ago.
They had sports clothes on...
...and backpacks with them...
...and the four of them...
...stayed together constantly.
They spoke very softly to one another...
...and there were other people there.
It was a beautiful day...
...the sun shone to greet you...
...the houses of the city were bathed in gold...
...and those people all had a sort of...
...silent melancholy about them.
Nobody said anything.
I cannot say that the people were afraid.
We went to meet the unknown.
We didn't know what was waiting for us.
This was the first destination for the Franks and the other prisoners.
Westerbork Transit Camp in northern Holland.
This film was made by the commandant...
...to show his superiors in Berlin how successful he was...
...in keeping his prisoners occupied...
...before sending them on to less benign places in Poland or Germany.
104,000 people were processed through here...
...between 1942 and 1945...
...more than 75% of the Jews in Holland...
...before the outbreak of war.
Proudly, and without irony, the commandant showed...
...the humiliation of his prisoners...
...who were largely ignorant of the fate that awaited them.
Of the 60,000 or so who were sent to Auschwitz from here...
...only 673 were ever to return.
And of the 34,313 transported to Sobibor death camp...
...just 19 came back.
In the meantime, Westerbork offered ball games and calisthenics.
The Jews were encouraged to entertain themselves with a weekly cabaret.
Three survivors of that time in August 1944...
...returned for the first time in 50 years.
All, like the Franks, had been captured in hiding.
It is maybe unbelievable...
...but when we were arrested and brought to the prison...
Sal de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...I cannot say it was a kind of relief. No.
But there was something that we said:
"Now this is maybe the end of the war. "
Because we knew the invasion was going on...
...and, "The end is finally in sight.
What we have to do now is try to survive this. "
It was overwhelming.
I knew it was Westerbork.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder
Westerbork Prisoner June/Sept 1944
I thought, "This is the end," because
I knew what happened in Germany.
And I knew that they were going to kill us.
We never gave up hope that we would survive the war.
Rose de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
There was not that much
Gestapo supervision in the camps.
The first ones I saw were the Franks.
I knew Margot rather well...
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...and I knew Anne.
We said to each other,
"You too, here? You too?
Were you hidden? What happened?"
But very soon you were taken inside the camp...
...and you had to be registered...
...and you got your wooden shoes...
...because we were punished, because we were hidden.
For me, it was the best time of the war.
No hunger, nice boys.
Frieda Menco
Westerbork Prisoner July/Sept 1944
We worked during the daytime.
Wasn't bad.
Then we got food...
...and we were standing around and making jokes with each other.
Like other prisoners, the eight...
...were given make-work jobs by their captors.
The Franks had the task of breaking up old batteries for recycling.
Otto Frank wanted something better for his Anne.
I was cleaning a table...
...and then at once, somebody came to me...
...with a girl-
That was Otto Frank.
Later on, I knew it.
He was with Anne, and he asked me:
"Here's Anne, my daughter.
Do you have work for her?"
Because he wanted, of course, her to be inside with us.
Then she said to me, "I can help you.
I'm very handy. I can do everything. "
This was the end, actually.
This was it.
It all started here.
My grandparents...
...all my uncles, my aunts, my nieces, my nephews...
...all my friends.
They came here, and it was the beginning of the end.
And I really...
...feel like this is...
...a big cemetery.
In the end, you start to believe that it won't happen.
You know that there are transports going each Tuesday.
But when two months have passed...
...and your own name wasn't on the list, you start to believe:
"We can stay here until the end of the war. "
Because by then of course, we knew that there would be an end.
Although it was incredible, but we knew...
...that the English and the Americans were already in Europe.
And then it came, and you became very factual.
You took your things, everything-
You got back what belonged to you...
...because they had taken that away from you...
...because they gave you that outfit.
It was like what happened so many times later. It was like having-
I don't know how you call it. You don't quite realize what's going on...
...and what will happen with you and to you.
Eighty-three trains left Westerbork during the second World War...
...for the Polish death camps of Auschwitz and Sobibor.
On September 3, 1944, they loaded many of the Jews in Westerbork...
...onto the very last transport to Auschwitz.
1019 men, women and children...
...amongst them, the group of eight from the secret annex.
For most, it was to be their last sight of Holland.
Darkness...
...is the first thing I think about.
Being cramped in.
Too many people.
No room enough.
Luggage.
No possibility to lie.
Sitting for three days.
Now and then standing.
You were like in a trance.
You didn't realize.
You realized that very bad things were to happen...
...and to be completely powerless.
Sometimes we stood up. We got up...
...and looked through cracks...
...when we were at a station when the train stopped.
Because we still had no idea how we went and where it would end...
...and how long it would take.
People cried, and on the other side, they told stories to each other...
...to try to sleep, to sleep standing.
There was not enough food and drink.
We were, I think, about 40 or 50 people...
...in that cattle car.
We were standing.
Sometimes we got to our knees to rest a little bit.
Urinating and other things.
I don't remember what we did, but there was nothing there, nothing.
I think we just let it go.
And it was like an endless journey.
And even that was better than that there would have come an end to it.
Because the end was not good.
That, we felt.
Your imagination stops...
...at certain moments.
You refuse to imagine the worst.
On September 5, the train from
Holland reached its final destination:
Auschwitz death camp in southwest Poland.
All those lamps.
Terrible, terrible hard.
The color was so terrible.
It was yellowish.
And we came there, men, women, children alike...
...on the platform here.
Don't know where exactly.
Yeah, I see there, the rail.
We were astonished.
I really thought I passed away, and this was hell.
Really, I thought, "I'm already dead. "
We were driven one way or another way.
After all, was the one way to the death...
...and this was to a kind of life.
I remember very well too...
...that you were naked before men...
...and I was educated chastely...
...in the values of my people.
And I got a shock.
I knew that from this moment on...
...all your norms and values...
...were of no importance anymore.
And that there was a quite new...
...set of values to be learned.
And if you didn't learn it, you would be dead.
I remember that I realized it in one second.
And I was only 18 years old.
According to Auschwitz records, more than half the people on that train...
...were gassed on the day after their arrival, September 6.
549 Jews, among them...
...every child under the age of 15.
They told us right away what was waiting for us: death.
"All of your people, they're going to the chimneys. Maybe tonight already. "
It was just a death factory.
We knew.
We saw that terrible pipe...
...burning day and night.
The smell. I thought that when it should come here...
...that I should have had a penetrant smell. But no.
I was sure that I should smell it because sometimes I smell it.
The smell of the disinfection, the smell of the burning flesh...
...and the smoke.
Anne, Margot and Edith Frank, and Mrs. van Pels...
...were among the 212 women from the Dutch train...
...who were granted entry into that hell they called Auschwitz-Birkenau.
They were placed in Women's Block 29.
It was no life.
It was no life at all.
We were degraded...
...to even less than beasts.
Less than animals.
We were standing outside, and I saw a wagon on the first day.
"What's he throwing on there?"
Dead bodies. Oh, my God!
I could hardly look.
The next couple of days later, I saw it.
"Oh, there's that wagon again who picks up the dead bodies. "
The next time, I didn't pay any attention to that wagon.
So your brain starts functioning differently...
...because if you didn't-
You didn't do it on purpose...
...but then you couldn't go on living.
In Auschwitz-Birkenau, Edith Frank and her daughters...
...were drawn together as never before.
A very important survival...
...for all the people in concentration camps...
...were the forming of groups.
Support groups.
And of course, as mother and children and daughters...
...you were a natural support group.
And I think everything from the past was faded away...
...against this scene of Auschwitz.
It was of no importance anymore, I suppose.
Was there any sign of the previous antagonism...
...between Anne and her mother?
I think it was all forgotten.
They were always together.
You can have the luxury...
...of a struggle with your mother in normal circumstances.
These circumstances were so...
...bad. Not only bad...
...but like a ghost writing...
...that everything fell away.
I'm quite sure about that.
The last time I saw Anne and Margot and Mrs. Frank...
...was when there had been a selection...
...for a working camp.
But you never knew for what the selection was.
But Anne and her mother were told...
...that Anne was not allowed to go with our group...
...because she had scabies.
Her mother and Margot decided to stay with Anne.
We went to a labor camp where we...
...didn't get food and worked hard...
...but most of us survived.
There were few deaths, and there were no gas chambers.
Had she not had the scabies...
...and had they gone with our transport...
...they had had a better chance to survive.
So because Anne suffered from scabies...
...and her mother and sister stayed with her...
...they lost their chance to leave
Auschwitz for the work camp...
...where many of the Dutch women saw out the remainder of the war.
As for the men, when they had first arrived at Auschwitz, September 5...
...Otto Frank, Hermann and
Peter van Pels, and Fritz Pfeffer...
...together with the other 254 males who had not immediately been gassed...
...had been separated from their women and taken to the nearby Auschwitz I.
This, the original death camp created from an old Polish army barracks...
...may have been smaller than
Auschwitz-Birkenau...
...where the women had remained within sight of the gas chambers...
...and three crematoria, but life here for the men was no easier.
Mr. van Pels was the first to wither.
We told him, "Don't give up. "
He did, and it was just like he melted away. It was two weeks-
Two days, he was gone.
He gave up.
That was it.
No one knows exactly when they took
Hermann van Pels to the gas chamber...
...but it was only a few weeks after his arrival at Auschwitz.
Otto Frank and Sal de Liema resolved...
...to keep up their morale by whatever means.
People around us...
...like we all were, of course very nervous.
Talking about food all the time.
Talking about clothes...
...that we didn't have any, practically no clothes.
Only the striped clothes that we had.
The food was just a piece of bread that they'd give you. It was really bad.
So Mr. Frank and I-
We knew each other from Westerbork.
He said, "We should get away from those people...
...because if you start talking about food and everything...
...your brain is gonna go. "
And we said, "We understand that physically...
...we maybe will not survive this. "
We should try to...
...survive mentally...
...and talk about things that had nothing to do with the camp, like:
"Do you remember the melody from the 9th Symphony from Beethoven?"
And then we start singing to each other...
...just to get away from this fear.
Just to get our brain...
...thinking about other things.
We talked about van Gogh, Rembrandt.
"Ever go to the Van Gogh Museum?
Ever go to the Rijk Museum?"
And all those things, just not to-
To get out of our minds.
To get out of this here.
And it really helped, I think.
He was older, much older than I was.
He said, "You know, why don't you call me Papa Frank...
...because I have to have something in my life...
...that I can be a papa to. "
I didn't know what he was talking about.
I said, "What do you mean?
I have a father...
...and he is hidden in the Netherlands, in Holland.
If you do it for me, you don't have to, because I have already a father...
...and he's alive.
I know he's hidden. "
"No," he said, "you do it for me.
I'm the type of a man, I need this.
I need somebody to be a papa for. "
So I told him, "If it will help you, I'll do that. "
He said, "Call me Papa Frank. " Until he died, when he wrote his letters...
...he always signed his letters,
"Papa Frank. "
I was standing one time in the snow...
...naked...
...after we came back from our work.
We stand appell here, outside here...
...and a German soldier came...
...and he had his fur coat on and he looked at me and said:
"Cold, huh? It is cold?"
I didn't even answer.
I just looked at him.
And he said, "You know you will not survive this, you know that.
But in case you will survive-
But I'll take care of it that it's not gonna happen.
Nobody, but nobody will believe you...
...what we did to you people. Nobody. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
One day in Auschwitz,
I was very depressed.
I had been beaten the day before...
...and that had really affected me...
...also in terms of my morale.
It was a Sunday morning...
...and I said, "I can't get up. "
And then my comrades...
...all Dutchmen of course...
...because I was the only German...
...among Dutchmen...
...but I was totally accepted by the others...
...they said to me,
"That's not possible...
...you must get up, otherwise you are lost. "
And then they went to a Dutch doctor...
...who worked with a German doctor...
...and this Dutch doctor...
...came to me in my barracks.
He said, "Get up and come...
...tomorrow morning to the sick barracks...
...and I'll speak to the German doctor...
...so that you will be accepted. "
And that is what happened...
...and through that I was saved.
While Otto languished in a sick barracks...
...his daughters were transported away.
On October 28, 1944, they were separated from their mother...
...and together with 1308 other women, they were sent here...
...to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder was with them.
You see with your own eyes how beautiful it is. It is beautiful.
And there were birds here.
And I wanted to be a bird.
Freedom, freedom, freedom.
I thought, "Oh, how nice to be a bird.
You can fly wherever you go. "
I was simply jealous of birds.
When Anne, Margot, Rachel and the others arrived at Bergen-Belsen...
...the camp was overflowing...
...with new inmates brought from throughout Europe.
The barracks being built to accommodate them were not ready...
...and they were crammed into the makeshift shelter of tents.
On November 7, a violent storm raged through the camp...
...destroying many of these.
Seeking shelter from the rain...
...Anne and Margot encountered
Lientje and Janny Brilleslijper...
...the two Dutch sisters whom they knew from Auschwitz and Westerbork.
It stormed, it hailed.
We had walked four kilometers...
...and we sat together...
...the two of us...
...with only our two little faces...
...sticking out of two blankets.
Those dark horse blankets...
...with our heads together...
...and only our two little faces...
...like two heaps on a little hill...
...up against a tree...
...to stay as dry as possible.
And four legs came walking up...
...also with blankets around them...
...and over their heads.
And at the same time as we saw them...
...we all threw off our blankets with a shout...
"Oh, how wonderful that you are here. "
How can you find something wonderful...
...in the middle of a concentration camp?
Deliberately starved, frozen and racked with disease...
...Bergen-Belsen was no place to be in those last months of World War II.
A wooden barracks was found for the unfortunate women from Auschwitz.
But Anne and Margot Frank came to be in the worst position of all:
In the lower bunk next to the door.
Incapable of protecting themselves...
...from the vicious wind that swept through Bergen-Belsen's barren acres.
They shouted, "Close the door!
Close the door!
It is cold! It is cold!
It is cold!"
And it was terrible for them, of course.
What did the Frank girls look like when you saw them in the barracks?
Very terrible. Terrible. Sick.
Thin. No hair.
Their eyes, very big. Very big eyes because they were so thin.
Almost impossible to imagine...
...but there was a time when the name Bergen-Belsen...
...brought hope to the eyes of Jews due to be transported here.
In the early years, the Nazis planned it as a camp for Jews...
...who might be used for exchange for German prisoners of war.
In those long ago days, Anne's friend
Lies Goslar had been sent here...
...with her sister and father, the former
German government minister.
In 1945, Lies discovered she was in the compound...
...next to the Dutch women from Auschwitz.
One day, a friend of mine tells me:
"You know, between all these women, there is your friend, Anne Frank. "
I don't know, I felt very crazy...
...because I was thinking the whole time:
"Anne is safe in Switzerland. "
I was sure of this. This was what the tenant said to me.
And so I had no choice to go also near this barbed wire.
This was not allowed, and the German in the watchtower was watching us.
And you know he would have shot if he would have caught us.
So we couldn't see. I told you there were barbed wire with straw...
...and we couldn't see the other side.
So I just went near at dark...
...and I start to call,
"Hello? Hello?" Something like this.
And who answered me was Mrs. van Pels.
Maybe the Dutch women went near the barbed wire...
...because the others didn't know anybody. I don't know.
I didn't even ask her, "How are you?"
I knew her, but not very good.
But immediately she said to me,
"You want Anne?" And I said, "Yes. "
And she says, "You know,
I will call her for you.
Margot I can't call for you.
She's very sick already.
But Anne I will call for you. "
And so I was standing there in the cold, and I was waiting.
And then suddenly, I heard somebody calling me...
...and it was Anne.
And this was awful.
The first thing, we both started to cry. Then I said:
"What are you doing here?
You are in Switzerland. "
And she answered me, "We wanted this rumor to go around...
...because we hoped then the Germans will not look after us. "
And then she said she had nobody anymore.
And this was not right, and I am so very sorry because she said:
"My mother is dead. " And her mother really was dead at that moment...
...but she couldn't know. She was sure her mother was killed when she left.
But her mother came out later, was not killed...
...she just died of exhaustion in the beginning of January.
Her sister, she knew, was very, very sick already.
But now her father.
Look, if it was Mengele or somebody else...
...they wouldn't know how old you are.
They would see only naked bodies.
And Mr. Frank was 55 years old...
...but he was only one month in the Dutch camp...
...so he looked still very good.
And the Germans just looked and saw somebody that still can walk...
...so they sent him to the right, to live.
But Anne thought they go by the age, and she was sure of it.
"My father is dead. He is an old man. "
And I always think, if she had known her father is still alive-
After her sister died, she just was without any hope.
Then maybe she had-
You know, it was only...
...one month she died before the liberation.
But she didn't know, and so she had really nothing to live for.
At this time, as a special prisoner being kept for possible exchange...
...Lies Goslar received a parcel from the Red Cross.
My friends, everybody gave me a glove or a little sock and a little bread.
So I came back at night with such a small package.
And then I hear her again, and we were speaking.
I told her about my little sister.
I told her my mother wasn't alive anymore. She didn't know.
Miep only told her that my-
That the baby died.
And my father was then already in hospital.
He died 25 of February, and this was before.
And I throw the package over...
...and then I heard her crying or shouting.
And I couldn't understand.
"What happened?"
"The lady next to me caught the package, and she run away with it. "
And she didn't give her anything.
I said, "I will try for another time. "
And really, I tried another time.
And this time she caught the package.
And it was the last time I saw her.
More than 50,000 of Bergen-Belsen's inmates died in 1945...
...as disease and starvation ravaged the camp.
Typhus, carried by lice, was a particularly horrible killer.
It is terrible when you are covered in lice.
Anne had thrown away her clothes...
...and she came to us crying...
...wrapped only in her gray blanket.
Lientje (my sister) lay sick...
...and I couldn't do anything...
...except give Anne some clothes to wear...
...and give her some delousing material.
And I promised to come to her the next day...
...to come to both of them...
...because she said,
"You have to come.
Margot is so ill. "
At that time...
...Margot was already mortally sick.
I suppose she also had typhus.
I'm not sure.
But the next day,
I couldn't get away...
...and it took at least four or five days...
...before I went to her...
...and then they were already dead.
Both dead.
And all of a sudden...
...I didn't see them anymore.
But you would not pay attention.
The place was empty.
We were sick.
And when I was ill, to speak about myself...
...is why I couldn't pay more attention than I did.
They're not there anymore.
They are dead.
That was that.
Outside in the entry guard...
...all of them were swept away.
Boom. They are outside.
I don't know whether I can talk about it.
Meat was traded...
...bodies.
It's very difficult...
Leave it.
I can't say any more.
The bodies from our barracks...
...we almost couldn't lift them anymore.
They were thrown onto a pile...
...between the barracks...
...and inscribed on my eyes...
...are these people...
...in every possible position...
...in every possible form...
...covered in snow...
...completely naked...
...because they would always be undressed.
On a pile with wide open eyes.
We tried to close as many eyes as possible.
It didn't always work.
Bergen-Belsen, as filmed by British liberators:
A place where humanity had been reduced to the worst indignities.
Cannibalism became part of a desperate struggle...
...to quench the most appalling hunger.
Only a few hundred yards away...
...the Germans kept supplies of food and medicine...
...while their prisoners died by the tens of thousands.
In November 1943, a year and a half before her death...
...in the safety of her
Amsterdam hiding place...
...Anne Frank had a nightmare in which
Hanneli Goslar appeared before her.
Hanneli Goslar in a concentration camp.
"I saw her there, dressed in rags...
...her face thin and worn.
She looked at me with such sadness and reproach in her enormous eyes...
...that I could read the message in them:
'Oh, Anne, why have you deserted me?
Help me, help me.
Rescue me from this hell. '
And I can't help her.
I can only stand by and watch...
...while other people suffer and die.
All I can do is pray to God to bring her back to us.
If only I could help her.
Dear God, I have everything
I could wish for...
...while fate has her in its deadly clutches.
Hanneli, Hanneli. If only
I could take you away.
If only I could share everything I have with you.
It's too late, but I'll never forget her again...
...and I'll always pray for her.
Yours, Anne. "
She didn't do so much wrong, you know, if you are in this age.
But this is one of the reasons that I tell the story now...
...because it is the other way around.
Yes, today I am standing here, and she is dead.
And so I am quite obliged to tell about her.
And she wanted to be so very famous.
I can't help a lot of this but a little bit.
I think, "What a waste, such a young life should end...
...and without any reason. "
She could really have given something to the world.
The whole thing is crazy.
My father died there one week after I saw her.
I don't know.
I cannot judge this whole period.
Nobody can understand it, I think.
I don't know.
Auschwitz had been liberated two and a half months before Bergen-Belsen.
On a freezing January 27, 1945...
...a Ukrainian division of the Soviet army, accompanied by a film crew...
...arrived at the site of the most successful mass murder...
...in mankind's history.
The last SS guards had already fled...
...leaving behind only those too young or infirm...
...to be led away on the now-notorious death marches.
The gassings at Auschwitz had already stopped the previous November.
The gas chambers dynamited.
But in a wild attempt to cover their tracks...
...the SS dragged thousands away with them in desperate flight...
...in the biting cold.
Those of the prisoners who could not keep up...
...were shot at the side of the road by their German escort.
Tens of thousands perished
"somewhere in Europe" of hunger...
...thirst or exhaustion, or from an SS bullet.
Fritz Pfeffer had been amongst those taken away before the Russians came...
...to die on December 20, 1944...
...in Neuengamme concentration camp in Germany.
Anne's boyfriend from the days in the annex, Peter van Pels...
...was marched out of Auschwitz by the Germans on January 16...
...and taken to Mauthausen death camp in Austria...
...where he died on May 5, 1945...
...just three days before the Americans liberated that camp.
His mother, Auguste van Pels, was sent on a crazy journey...
...across Germany and Czechoslovakia.
First to Bergen-Belsen, then to Theresienstadt.
And in the last days of the Reich...
...to an unknown camp, where she too died.
One of the millions of anonymous bodies left...
...by Hitler's failed vision of a thousand-year empire.
Otto Frank, weighing less than 115 pounds...
...was amongst the lucky few that the Russians found alive in Auschwitz.
When he was recovered, Otto wrote to his mother in Switzerland...
...where she had lived since before the war.
His letters then remained forgotten...
...in the attic of her home in Basle for nearly 50 years...
...until they were discovered by his nephew in May 1994.
"Auschwitz, 23 February 1945.
Dearest Mother: Hopefully these lines will reach you...
...bringing you and all my loved ones the news...
...that I have been liberated by the Russians...
...that I am healthy and in good spirits...
...and that I am being well taken care of.
I do not know where Edith and the children are.
We have been separated since September 5, 1944.
I just hope to see them back in good health.
I'm longing to see you all again and hope that this will be possible soon.
All my love, greetings and kisses.
Your son, Otto. "
So it was that Otto Frank, the only survivor...
...of the eight who had been in hiding in Amsterdam...
...took the long journey back to his Dutch adopted homeland.
By May, with the war in Europe ended...
...his Russian liberators had sent him...
...to the Black Sea port of Odessa.
There, he was placed on a New Zealand merchant ship...
...bound for France.
"May 26, 1945.
The steamer Monowai.
Dearest Mother and all you loved ones:
Tomorrow we arrive in Marseilles, and this letter can hopefully be mailed.
I imagine I will be able to telegraph you...
...so that you will get the news of my return in good health.
All my hope is the children.
I cling to the conviction that they are alive...
...and that we will be together again.
Unfortunately, Edith did not survive.
She died on January 6, 1945...
...in the hospital, of starvation.
Her body could not withstand attack of influenza.
The closer we get to home, the more impatient we get...
...to hear news of our loved ones.
What happened in all these years!
We own nothing anymore.
We won't find a pin when we get back.
Bernd Elias
Otto Frank's nephew
The Germans stole everything.
No photograph, letter or document will remain there.
Financially, we had no worries during the last years.
I earned good money and saved.
Now all is gone.
But I don't worry about this.
We have gone through too much to worry about things like that.
Only the children.
The children are what count.
I hope to get news from you straightaway.
Maybe you already have news of the girls.
I cannot write about everything that I am thinking of.
I have to stay in Holland as...
...with the exception of a tattooed number on my arm...
...I have no papers and therefore must think of seeing you later.
The main thing is that we have contact.
We hope to see each other soon.
With innermost greetings and kisses and love, your Otto. "
My husband worked on the station...
Miep Gies
...registering all the people who are coming down from...
...the concentration camps.
And he ask everyone:
"Have you seen Mr. Frank?
Have you heard about Mr. Frank?"
And one day, one evening, he came home and he said:
"I have good news for you.
Otto Frank is coming home. "
And when he said this, we lived downstairs.
Mr. Frank came...
...along the window.
I ran to the door.
At first what I ask was:
"Where's Edith?"
Otto Frank said to me,
"Edith never come...
...but I have hope for the children. "
And he came to us.
Because he had no house, no nothing...
...he lived seven years in our house.
But the life go on.
We go every day...
...to the office.
But I do not give him the diary of Anne Frank.
You may not know this...
...but when he was on the ship...
...from Odessa to Marseilles...
...Otto wrote a letter to his mother.
In that letter he said this:
"Kugler and Kleiman, and especially Miep...
...her husband and Bep Voskuijl cared for us for two years...
...with everything we needed...
...in spite of the dangers...
...and unprecedented sacrifices they made.
One cannot describe it.
I will never be able to repay what all these people have done. "
I never know about this. No.
That is the first time...
...I heard it. Thank you.
While Miep kept the diary secret from
Otto in case Anne should return...
...he was desperate to find his daughters.
He advertised in newspapers and visited the Dutch Red Cross...
...asking, always asking for news of Anne and Margot.
At the end of July, he was told that someone knew of their fate.
In August, he had the tragic news confirmed.
He stood on the porch and rang the bell...
...and remained standing on the porch.
He said, "Are you Janny Brandes?"
And I said, "Yes. "
"Can I come in?"
Because he was a very polite gentleman.
He came into the hallway...
...and remained standing there and said:
"What happened to my daughters?
I am Otto. "
I could hardly speak...
...because it was very difficult...
...to tell someone...
...that his children were not alive anymore.
I said, "They are no more. "
He turned deathly pale...
...and slumped down into a chair.
I just put my arm around him.
When the girls' death had been confirmed...
...Miep gave up the secret she kept hidden from Otto...
...since the day of the family's capture more than a year before.
From her top drawer, she handed him...
...three books and a sheaf of loose papers:
Anne's diary, which she herself had never read.
I took the diary...
...out of my desk...
...and gave him it with the words:
"That is a testament for your daughter Anne. "
Can you look?
Can you see how this man looked at me?
Lost his wife.
Lost his two children.
He had the diary.
Otto transcribed sections of the diary for his mother in Switzerland.
He also started showing it to friends...
...seeking their views on what to do with his daughter's unique legacy.
They all advised him to have it published...
...but his efforts met with no success.
Then this article, written by a friend of a friend...
...appeared in an Amsterdam paper in April 1946...
...and finally, a publisher stepped forward.
Het Achterhuis, "The Back House, " appeared in June 1947.
Initially, it made little impact.
Then in the 1950s...
...German, French, English and other translations began to appear.
In 1955, a stage adaptation opened on
Broadway to a rapturous reception.
The transformation of the 15-year-old
German-Jewish refugee...
...into an emblem of the Holocaust gathered pace.
A 1959 feature film based on the play added further to this process.
To some, she had become little short of a saint.
But her diary, at the very least, had become a publishing phenomenon.
In 1953, Otto had remarried and moved to Switzerland.
In the absence of Anne, he became the focus for his daughter's celebrity.
He, in turn, came to symbolize the perfect father so many children crave.
Thousands wrote to him from around the world...
...and he replied to each individually.
If young people are writing to me after reading the diary...
Otto Frank interviewed in 1976
...I start to think:
"That is, for me, one of the most precious. "
Though Otto developed relationships, sometimes close ones...
...with many of the children who wrote to him...
...he admitted he never understood his own daughter in her lifetime.
Was she in fact the optimist and cheerful person that he saw as a child?
She showed herself like that.
But in fact, I only learned to know her really...
...through her diary.
Throughout these years, one persistent problem refused to go away:
Citing differences between different language versions of the diary...
...which were never explained in the various editions...
...together with further fictional scenes in the play and film...
...neo-Nazis around the world...
...wanting to throw doubt on the very existence of the Holocaust...
...alleged that the diary was a hoax.
Painful and inconclusive lawsuits followed...
...but it was only in 1980, after Otto's death...
...that the authenticity of the diary was finally tested scientifically.
The extensive report by the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation...
...took five years to complete and was eventually published...
...with a study of all the versions of Anne's diary.
It categorically stated that the diary was genuine in every respect.
In 1960, one of Holland's most secret places became one of its most public.
The Franks' annex was opened as a museum...
...and is now visited by over
600,000 tourists a year.
Otto also created charitable foundations...
...to perpetuate Anne's message to the world.
Anne was not simply to be commemorated...
...but her short life was to become a more general force for good.
To fight against prejudice and discrimination...
...and hatred against people of different race and religion.
Since 1985, a touring exhibition...
...telling Anne's life story and its relevance to current world affairs...
...has traveled from country to country, from Moscow to Minneapolis...
...South America to South Africa.
It has also shown that the diary has had some surprising readers...
...in surprising places.
During the many years my comrades and I spent in prison...
Nelson Mandela
President of South Africa
Political Prisoner 1964-1990
...we derived inspiration from the courage and tenacity...
...of those who challenge injustice...
...even under the most difficult circumstances.
Some of us read Anne Frank's diary on Robben Island...
...and derived much encouragement from it.
It's very interesting...
...the letters of the German children.
They always ask me everything...
...because they wrote me:
"My father or grandfather...
...didn't tell me anything about the war.
They say always, 'That is the past.
That is over. "'
But that is not true.
The past goes always with you...
...in your whole life, and we can learn from the past.
In 1941, there was a wedding at Merwedeplein in Amsterdam.
After filming the street...
...the cameraman pointed at the onlookers above.
There at the window was Anne Frank.
This is the only known moving footage of her.
When she stood at the window that sunny day in June...
...it's not surprising that the 12-year-old Anne Frank...
...was yet to find her life's purpose.
But less than three years later, as she sat caged...
...in the fragile security of her hiding place...
...she had discovered her destiny.
"Wednesday, April 5, 1944.
My dearest Kitty:
I don't want to have lived in vain like most people.
I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to people...
...even those I've never met.
I want to go on living, even after my death.
And that's why I'm grateful to God for having given me this gift...
...which I can use to develop and to express...
...all that's inside me.
Yours, Anne M. Frank. "
A meadow in early morning somewhere on earth.
Hidden here is the world as wast as our own where the weeds are like inpenetrable jungles, stones are mountains, and even the smallest pond becomes an ocean
Time passes differently here, an hour is like a day, a day is like a season, and the passing of a season is a lifetime.
But to observe this world...
...we must fall silent now...
...and listen to its murmurs.
[ Pigs squealing ]
MAN: As President Reagan was preparing to deliver his weekly radio address from Camp David, he ad-libbed thoughts on the economy during a microphone check, not intended to be part of his speech.
PRESIDENT REAGAN:
My fellow Americans,
I've talked to you about the economic problems and opportunities our nation faces.
I'm prepared to tell you it's a hell of mess.
The hard line being taken by the Reagan administration concerning the air controllers strike...
The Supreme Court delivered a potentially staggering setback to labor unions.
It comes at a time when union officials are charging there is a growing campaign to break unions.
MAN:
The operation will be nonunion.
Salaries will be cut in half.
MAN #2: Wilson Foods declared bankruptcy.
With the stroke of a pen, it could stay in business but void its labor contract and slash workers' salaries by 40% to 50%.
WOMAN: These are hard times for the meatpacking industry.
MAN: Union labor has taken almost 50% wage-and-benefit cuts to keep their jobs and their companies afloat.
At least I'm taking some money home instead of nothing.
WOMAN: In Waterloo, Iowa, a shutdown.
At Iowa Beef, a violent strike...
MAN: Striking meatpackers facing 40% pay cuts go packing bricks against a truck at a Wilson Foods plant.
RATHER: Crossed picket lines in spite of an automobile barricade as Hormel's flagship plant, open for a second week...
WOMAN: ...send in the guards was reached after city officials said the situation at Hormel was beyond their control.
This is not Austin anymore!
It's Hormel, Minnesota!
You guys are helping them!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Austin, Minnesota, is not just about Austin, Minnesota.
Austin is the cavalry.
The workers in this nation.
Workers somewhere, sometime, someplace, must stand up and say,
"Enough is enough!"
We want jobs and justice.
Someday.
Can I give you a pamphlet here?
So you can see what's going on in the Austin plant. Thank you.
Can I give you one of these about the Hormel injury rate?
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.
Aren't you Mr. Anderson?
Hi. I don't know if you remember me.
- We had the good years.
- You did.
And this, I sure hope it comes, gets straightened out.
I'd like to see something settled.
And I understand your side of it.
I really do. I wouldn't like to take a cut either.
I wish everybody good luck.
I hope they don't have trouble with the company.
I'm retired, and if I were still working, if I lost my job, that would be terrible.
MAN:
Could I talk to your husband?
WOMAN: No, but there's something
I would love to say to you.
Aren't you guys happy working at the Hormel plant?
Under the current conditions, no.
We were happy making $10.69 and when Hormel treated us decent.
Why do you stay at a place you're not happy?
We don't have all the money in the world like the Knowltons.
There are so many people that would love to have your job at $8.75 an hour and all those nice benefits.
When we were your age, we weren't making what you were.
Then give us a fair shake like you got a fair shake.
[ Door closes ]
Hmm.
If we gotta give up 23% wages and 30% cut in benefits, when the company's making $30 million, what are we gonna have to give when they show a loss?
Two years ago under the incentive program, my last incentive check in the hog cut in the new plant,
I grossed $637 for 47 hours' work.
After the incentive program was taken away,
I went down to $409 a week.
Today I'm making $312.
Working twice as hard for the same amount of hours.
It's ridiculous.
My father worked for George A. Hormel plant for many years.
He was also a very proud man.
He was a hard worker.
He was proud of his products.
He was in the days of heavy production.
He went out on a stretcher one day from the plant.
My husband now, I'm proud to be a wife of a hog cutter.
I'm proud of the products.
But I don't like the way they're treating my family or my husband or anyone else who ever worked for that plant.
[ Cheers and applause ]
JIM: It's a real quagmire of a situation, and people are really getting hurt.
Their pride is hurt because they can't fulfill the needs of their family, and they've somehow got to go on welfare programs, and people are very angry, hurt, upset, frustrated.
And it's difficult to vent your frustrations in the proper direction.
WOMAN:
Utility workers make more.
Meter readers make more.
The garbage collectors make more.
A guy that works with Wes, or did work with my husband quit.
He got hired at the city.
He's starting at $11-something an hour.
But I don't begrudge anybody that's making $30,000,
But let us live in our house.
Let us live in our $32,000 house.
And that we all may walk in faith
In your community
NYBERG:
In Austin, 22,000 people.
We're in a little world by ourselves down here.
These are the people we go to church with.
These are the people we go to grocery stores with.
We meet on the street.
We meet in various forms of recreation.
We rub shoulders with them.
Do we care about our employees?
Yes, we do.
But in the long term, we don't want to go the way of many other packers who realized too late that their costs were out of line and then tried to recover and couldn't.
FILM NARRATOR:
It's been written that Jay
was a born innovator
and remembered for his social conscience.
His thoughtful understanding of
and concern for the welfare of the working man
was surely what gave rise to the benefits
that have been made available to Hormel personnel.
He initiated the first guaranteed annual wage.
There was also a first-of-its-kind
profit-sharing plan for the workers
that paid a share of the profits to each of them.
Perhaps that explains why everyone at Hormel
strives for quality and efficiency.
WOMAN: I've worked for Hormel, it'll be 43 years this year.
And if it were necessary as a survival,
I would be all for it.
We've done it before over the many, many times.
But this, I think, is just the mood of the industry, and they're jumping on the bandwagon to be one of them to say,
"We were able to do it, too."
Where, I think, if they would have left our wages at their present standard, people would have really used them as a shining example that in hard times, if you really have good productivity, good relationship with your employees, that you're able to handle the bad times.
I hope that they have enough of the vision that I think I must have for the welfare of the long-term future of the company, that would say,
"We can do no more."
If Jay Hormel were here today, if George A. Hormel were here, they probably would be doing exactly the same thing that we are.
I think unions are getting their teeth kicked in.
I think if you're into a situation of where you're getting beat up, you better try something different.
MAN: Corporate campaigns initiated by Ray Rogers...
MAN #2: Rogers has been used to targeting one enemy, the employer.
MAN #3: Rogers brought his Corporate Campaign here...
JIM: We were very ineffective in communicating our message.
MAN #4:
He managed to attract reporters from the "New York Times," the "Chicago Tribune"...
JIM: I ran across an article on
Ray Rogers and gave him a call.
MAN #5: Tough-talking labor consultant...
JIM: He said he needed to do a little research because he was a vegetarian, didn't know anything about meatpacking.
Ray came and made a presentation to our membership.
RAY: We will run a multimillion dollar campaign even though you don't have millions of dollars.
The greatest resource, the greatest strength you have is the people themselves.
And that's why we feel so confident that we can pull off a major victory, not just for Local P-9 in Austin, but for labor throughout this entire country.
- Congratulations, partner.
- Yeah.
The price of poker just went up.
In this game, because that's the way the company views it.
It's a game the way they want to treat people, hold their whole lives in jeopardy.
And to them, it might be a game.
And to us, it's a war.
Things can really start moving now.
Super.
That's just really nice.
And we hope that the corporate executives from Hormel come.
We hope the executives from the bank come.
We want everybody to see the type of program that we plan on running and then let them begin to lose the night's sleep like they've caused this community to lose sleep.
[ Chanting ]
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
RAY: On our staff, we have experts in all facets of research and analysis, communications experts, and experts in all facets of political and community organization.
We looked out there in society and saw poor and working people getting the daylights kicked out of them.
We felt there had to be a mechanism that they and unions and community groups could turn to that had a lot of expertise in how to challenge powerful adversaries that were irresponsible in the policies directed at workers.
So we developed
Corporate Campaign programs.
And our campaign is one of taking the offense, showing that workers can fight back.
That they don't have to keep taking one loss after another.
You know what we need to do.
JIM: Ray told me you're never going to outspend a company, public-relations-wise.
My name is Ray Rogers.
I'm with Corporate Campaign.
JIM:
That what you needed to do was look at creating a situation that became a newsworthy situation.
The company spent millions in many years to build an image.
That's being destroyed overnight.
JIM: The strategy was to go after the money behind the corporation.
There's a lot of labor money in First Bank's system.
MAN: Ray Rogers and his Corporate Campaign mailed this letter to over 5,000 union members in the Midwest that says in part the First Bank system is a principal stockholder in the Hormel company and thus can influence policy.
This institution is directly involved in the policymaking process of Hormel.
JIM: Ray knows how to put labor's best foot forward so that John Q. Public would sympathize with our cause.
There's some guy I'd never seen.
They started talking to me about that Hormel situation.
The guy says, "Are you the guy that's been brought in?
Man, I'm telling you, you can't imagine how many of my friends are watching this.
We're 100% behind you.
You're teaching this country something.
And, by God, you gotta win."
This is what I'm getting everywhere.
You are a symbol of something that goes beyond Austin.
Don't you forget it.
Local P-9 engaged the services of a labor consultant from New York City.
Mr. Ray Rogers and Corporate Campaign.
And Mr. Rogers has a different philosophy about how to deal with companies.
Traditional collective bargaining is not the preferred method that he would use.
His traditional approaches are harassment, intimidation, and threats.
And his rationale for that mode of approaching an employer is that if you can embarrass a company hard enough and long enough, you'll bring that company to its knees.
And they will agree to the terms and conditions of his client unions, the ones that he represents.
So he came to us with that approach.
There's supposed to be some other pigs here today.
CROWD: We don't need
First Bank's greed!
If anybody doesn't have a sign, just grab a sign here.
CROWD: We don't need
First Bank's greed!
From day to day, you get to be on a high like today with everybody here.
But when you go home and nobody's around you, you tend to get down.
But then you get back up when you go back to the union hall and start helping.
Then you get up again.
We're on the right side of things.
People are realizing we're willing to fight that fight.
People recognize that the labor movement being a key factor if we're gonna have any real meaningful social -- economic -- Cut.
NARRATOR: Are you afraid of Corporate Campaign?
We're not.
What happens if they persist?
Well, I don't know.
With our position,
I don't know what they can do.
I realize that they can say a lot of things, but they can't do a lot of things.
And I think it's tragic, because the only thing they end up doing is destroying their jobs and their company.
MAN: Thank you all very much.
Appreciate it.
NARRATOR: The United Food and Commercial Workers
is the parent union of Austin's local union P-9.
The Local 9 will suffer as a result of it.
They can't negotiate by themselves.
Lewie Anderson is the director of the meatpacking division.
And they say, "This company is a profitable company, and nothing else in the universe matters.
We have a right to our $10.69.
We have a right to those benefits."
That's their thinking.
To go even beyond that there, they are convinced by Ray Rogers that the Corporate Campaign will achieve that goal for them.
He shot them a line of shit, is all he did.
The plain fact of the matter is there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever they are not going to win through a corporate campaign.
They are not gonna win.
If they continue, they're gonna become bigger losers than what they are now.
It is gonna cost them their jobs.
Instead of making $8.25 an hour, or $9.25 an hour...
MAN ON RADIO:
Good one by Glen Campbell.
It's time for the song of inspiration brought to you by your friends at Omaha Auto and Truck
Recyclers Association.
It used to be you always had problems.
You always had one or two local unions that were going through real serious problems, but you had some time to think about it and to work with them and stay with them and help them work through those problems.
But what you've had in the last five years is everybody's had problems.
They've had them all at the same time.
You're just running all over the country in all directions, trying to patch things up and get things going in the right direction.
Then you don't get to stay.
You have to go deal with another crisis.
The companies in this industry are embarked on a program to tear the wages up, to tear the fringe benefits up, to return us to the days of "The Jungle" 60 years ago.
Do the unions have any clout?
Does the public care about the unions anymore?
Can the unions sell this message?
CROWD:
Go!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Local unions like P-9
have complete autonomy to carry on all union business
as long as they don't violate
their international constitution.
The International Union can only give strategic advice.
MAN: What can you do that we can't do?
- So far, I haven't seen much.
- Really?
- [ Crowd groans ]
- There's your answer.
No, I want you to answer that.
I want you to answer that.
You're reading too many things about what Lewie Anderson and other people are saying.
- You're dodging the question.
- I'm not dodging the question.
That's a question that was asked.
I'm not gonna answer it.
What you do not have, what the International has not furnished, what you have not furnished is the analysis upon which you build a program of real, impenetrable economic and political pressure, harassing the company.
We have developed some damn good campaign literature.
I haven't seen anybody from the International come and give you that kind of direction or campaign literature.
One thing I'll credit you.
You're a hell of a motivator.
Millions of dollars worth of free and positive publicity for your campaign, national press coverage.
Yes, you have!
And that's your answer.
All right.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you with P-9?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Is what Local 9 proposing up there with the Corporate Campaign the answer to the problems we have seen in the meatpacking industry in the past and the challenges that we're faced for the future?
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, too.
Are you saying that regardless of what is decided by this organization, you're going to go ahead with that campaign as you've outlined it?
If the rank and file dictates they're gonna resist pay cuts, we're gonna resist the pay cuts.
And I guess we would like to see you on our side in this fight.
The Austin program, it occurs to us, is symptomatic of Reagan's philosophy.
"I'll get mine, and the hell with everybody else."
RAY: Maybe we shouldn't expect every meatpacker to receive the same wage.
Maybe we need to look at each company and say,
"What is the profitability of the company?"
Then base the wages that we expect on its profitability.
God damn it, the guy working at Armour, $6 bucks an hour, doing the same work they're doing in Austin deserves the $10.69, too, as well as every other packinghouse worker!
That is what we stand for.
That is what we gotta do.
We cannot have one group hanging way up here and everybody else down below.
It's the wrong kind of unionism.
We're here saying, you know, we've got a program.
We're representing a client and a large group of people.
We're gonna continue to represent them as long as they want us to.
MAN: Why won't the International support the Hormel workers?
Is $10.69 an hour too much?
Look, I worked in those packinghouses.
I worked for a very antiunion employer as a beef skinner, so I know what that work is.
And they deserve $10.69-plus, believe me.
One of the things that Local 9 has said to the Packing Committee is, "Well, if we can get $10.69 there, that's the shining star, and everybody will go to that."
But I gotta tell you, in some 10 or 15 years of our experience, that's not the case.
One of two things happens.
Those operators on the low end of the scale get bigger, or those on the high end of that wage scale say, "The hell with it," and they go out of business, or they close this plant and go down the road and open up a plant at $5.00 or $6.00 an hour.
That would be great if we could do that.
I'd be the first to say,
"Let's do it."
But it don't work that way.
We came into this thing alone, and we'll go out alone.
I want to tell you,
I am disgusted to be even associated with this organization.
You've got to.
John, take your pen if you're disgusted.
Yeah. You've got a lot of gutless people here.
JIM: We pleaded with the National Union that if they couldn't support us, get out of the way.
If you're gonna get in the way and run interference for Hormel, then we're gonna go right through you if we have to.
So you've got the International
Union looking at it and saying,
"If these people are successful, they may find that an International Union isn't necessary, and all they need is a labor consultant from time to time.
LEWIE:
Now we have a situation where some of the people from Local 9 and Ray Rogers have a caravan roaming across the country, spieling out some of the most antiunion venom.
JIM: Our caravan was designed to tell people what was going on from workers just like themselves.
We had the facts.
We had the information to back it up.
We were gonna tell it to them, give it to them, read it to them, sing it, whatever it took.
RAY:
$100,000 expense account, and Lewie Anderson was making his $70,000-plus salary and his lavish expense account.
If you think when the public sees that that they understand the complexities of what's going on in Austin, Minnesota.
All they see is 200 or 300 people screaming how the union is no good.
We're not like some other locals.
Our membership told us they didn't want that agreement by a 76% vote.
Get the Hormel chain settlement.
Do you think the vice-president of an international union ought tell you you ought to take a concession with by far the most profitable company in an industry?
LEWIE: Antiunionism is oozing out of our own ranks.
That'll destroy us quicker than anything will.
I know this is definitely a union-made tent.
JIM: People who believe in what they're doing are the most dangerous kind of folks in the world.
The union there.
52 in Monroe and this one.
We'll go hit the banks, and then we'll go on to Ottumwa.
MAN: I want to thank all you guys from P-9 because you have performed a miracle for the Hormel employees of Ottumwa.
I can look out in this crowd and see at least
40 guys and girls that down at work for the past seven years have looked like they were dead.
And you have resurrected them to life.
Hey, listen, thanks a lot.
Good talking to you.
JIM: We're creating a situation where the membership is starting to dictate to the leadership,
"Support these guys because we believe in what they're doing."
If making less money is so good, but people don't want to do it, why should they have to do it?
[ Horn honking ]
WOMAN:
Hormel hot dogs
We don't like Hormel and their hot dogs
P-9 thanks you.
We'll be back!
Yeah!
LEWIE: They have a machine in place to make you look like you don't know what you're talking about or carrying the company message.
Rogers and Guyette, with their machine, have a firm grip on that situation.
If you want to gain your union back, you're gonna have to recognize what you're up against.
This meeting is somewhat clandestine in that if you're going to put together a committee, then you need time to get it off the ground without them branding you at this moment that the International is behind it.
It started with four of us that met two weeks ago with Lewie.
It started off with that group.
We expanded to 16.
Now we're going to go in a meeting here.
All of us are gonna try to sing off the same sheet of music.
Hopefully, you'll be able to go back to Austin.
Once we get the ball rolling, we'll all be provided with information.
RAY:
So when anybody is attacking what this campaign is doing, attacking anybody working in this group and has done anything for this campaign, they're attacking every one of us.
WOMAN: What are we doing that's so antiunion?
I see more union people here and more support than I do anywhere.
That's not antiunion.
That's going forward.
I want to be a union of the '80s.
I want to welcome all our guests, visitors, friends, and everyone that is here today.
We have representatives from the Hormel locals in Fremont, Beloit, Ottumwa.
We've got our friends from
Farmstead Foods and Albert Lea, steelworkers from the Iron Range, representatives from the Teamsters.
Through good organization, good communications, we're able to wage a campaign that even the biggest unions in the country have not been able to wage.
Are you willing to stand up and fight?
CROWD:
Yeah!
Let's stand up!
Give me a "W"!
- "Give me an "I"!
- "I"!
- Give me an "N"!
- "N"!
- What do you got?
- Win!
We're gonna win it!
- Yeah!
- We're gonna win it!
MAN:
To some, he is a prophet.
A messiah who has assembled the tools that can bring corporate giants to their knees.
MAN: This man is a organizational genius.
There's no getting around that.
He's got all the bases covered.
People are playing pool, they're getting together.
There's a lot of things that are going on in that union hall that should have gone on years ago.
He's kept the hands and minds busy of the people.
MAN: Lewie Anderson is the Austin union's international vice-president in Washington.
Our research has shown that Hormel could do more damage to First Bank by taking their money out than what First Bank could ever do to Hormel.
Well, Lewie's lying.
Okay, I want to say this very clear.
Lewie is lying.
I believe he looked at Hormel's history.
He talked to some people, and he thought once he put a public campaign with the news media, they were gonna crumble.
The strategy or the research,
I should say, had about as much depth as piss on a flat rock.
How much more damage has to be done before you figure out that that strategy is not working?
Bull!
I don't take anything away from Local 9 in terms of rallying people.
They've done a good job with it.
But it's a doomed strategy.
It was doomed from the beginning, and we tried to impress that on them.
Being militant and standing up if you're on the wrong strategy doesn't make it right.
People still end up getting hurt.
Rates still continue to tumble.
You don't have the luxury of saying,
"At least we're fighting."
Because when you fight and it's over and you've lost everything, that's a terrible price to pay just to say that you were tough.
What we're doing makes sense, and we believe in it.
Belief is something that will carry you a long ways.
NARRATOR:
Hormel's proposal
keeps a base wage frozen for three years
at $10 per hour.
And any new employees would be paid $2 less for the same work.
Hormel's final offer is rejected
by both the local union and the International.
NYBERG:
If we're faced with a situation where there is a withholding of labor on one side, we could shut the plant down completely.
We could try to run the plant with management employees on a reduced basis.
We could hire temporary replacements for strikers who elect to stay out.
We could hire permanent replacements for strikers who elect to stay out.
Any combination of those things.
We'll send the letter tonight, then. Right, Case?
When we hand-deliver the letter, we're gonna be on strike, as of midnight on Friday.
MAN:
We'll tell them that.
You want to get that set up in the main hall?
RAY:
You get your story here and make sure everybody hears about it. Really.
Just go ahead.
Aw, come on.
Aw, this is your show.
[ Cheering ]
JIM: The Hormel company put us into a corner, and we were gonna come after them, like a fighter going into a fight.
When you know you've trained about as well as you can, it's time to get the gloves on or take them off and do what you got to do.
By over a 93% margin, the contract proposal termed by the company to be their last and final offer was rejected.
So the Executive Board has met, and we intend to give the company a 48-hour-working-day notice tonight before midnight.
[ Cheers and applause ]
For the first time in 52 years,
Hormel's Austin plant was about to be shut down by a strike.
You're looking pretty chipper today.
- Hi, Bill.
- Hiya, Jim.
Too bad we can't meet under better circumstances.
I need you to sign.
In fact, if you want to sign a couple of them, you can.
We got new pencils for everyone, just like the President.
No, we don't.
That's mine.
- Okay, there you go, Jim.
- Okay. Thanks.
What may result from the Hormel workers' action is a test of just how much muscle organized labor can or cannot flex.
Kevin Berger, Channel 5
Eyewitness News, St. Paul.
NYBERG:
I think it is tragic.
We were hoping that some resolve would be reached, so that this community and certainly our employees wouldn't have to go through what we're facing.
We've done everything humanly possible to resolve this thing on reasonable terms.
But we aren't going to resolve this dispute on unreasonable terms.
JIM: The company's strategy is a clear one.
They want to freeze us out.
They want to starve us out.
And I think the motto that we at
Local 9 have is best exemplified in one of Bruce Springsteen's latest songs.
"We made a promise.
We swore we'd always remember.
No retreat and no surrender."
And I think that the fact that these people are here today helping us so that the company can't starve us out is certainly a giant push well on the way to let this company know that we are not about to surrender.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
What we started is something that's gonna be more than maybe what we thought.
I see people working together, people willing to share, people borrowing clothes.
I see people opening up.
I see people crying.
It's just a whole new part of people, and we're pulling together.
You know, we're a big family.
Just so it doesn't.
If it takes too long, people are gonna get short on cash.
Then they're gonna feel the squeeze really bad.
My kid five weeks ago got his finger in the door at home.
Just one of those freak accidents.
Went in and had three stitches.
120 bucks.
There went half of my paycheck.
This money is to be used for food for the people of Local P-9.
I can't even add.
I can't even add.
One thousand...
One hundred...
Forty-nine dollars!
Almost $1,050.
And they're not done yet.
Take it in brotherhood.
Spirit.
JIM: This money will be very much needed by our membership.
And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Hey, Joe. They lost their power over there.
JIM: Our union hall became a fun place to be at.
There was a lot of things going on.
It became a place where families could come.
We had a lot of folks who liked to work on cars.
Instead of pulling picket duty, they fixed our cars.
We had carpenters who fixed people's homes.
They did what they liked to do.
They did their hobbies.
I asked Guyette,
"Tell me where
Corporate Campaign is today, where it's going next week and the following weeks and relate that to how we're getting back into the packinghouse."
All they did is the same old gibberish.
"We've got a group.
We're gaining support.
We got money coming in."
They start with this gibberish, and you say,
"l didn't ask you that."
"Let him speak!"
Then Rogers gets into his filibuster.
Then all of a sudden, it's, "boom." "Next question."
"I was in Ottumwa, and the guys there were patting me on the back."
This guy gets it, and he talks for 10 or 15 minutes.
LEWIE: When he gets up to start his filibuster, you got to have
7, 8, 9, 10 people say,
"Tell me how you're gonna get the jobs back.
Tell me how you're gonna get a contract."
You got to keep pounding into him,
"Where are you as far as settling this thing?"
You got some maniacs up there in the leadership position and a maniac in Rogers, who has yet to do one positive thing. who has yet to do one positive thing.
We can't be jacking around here forever.
This is a mess.
That's what I'm saying.
Employees shall receive as normal 40 hours' pay.
Vacation pay shall consist of an employee's normal 40-hour weekly check.
- Yeah. That's good enough.
- Good.
JIM: Normally, the National
Union managed negotiations.
However, in this particular situation, our national union was spearheading a concessionary drive, and we didn't want a concessionary contract.
Therefore, our national union was told, "Get out of the way.
We'll deal with our own negotiations."
It don't mean anything.
NYBERG:
When the union made a proposal that we thought was outrageous, what we had to do is come back with a proposal of our own.
Instead of just basing it blindly on the old contract, we looked at every provision of that agreement and said,
"What would make sense here?"
WOMAN:
Who's gonna pay for that?
MAN:
The company.
What is it?
Joint Management Labor.
LEWIE: Any seasoned, experienced negotiator knows you don't rewrite your whole contract.
You don't throw your whole contract up for grabs.
You don't give the company the opportunity to dismantle your contract because you rewrote it.
But that's exactly what the P-9 leadership did.
They rewrote a whole contract.
Language it has taken
40 years to negotiate, language that provides the local union to have a say in how the goddamn plant is run.
When management got done with that contract, those things didn't exist.
And I'm speaking to 40 years of bargaining gone as a result of these assholes rewriting that whole contract and submitting it to the company.
Being a negotiator requires a lot of different skills, especially in an industry that's in turmoil, like this one.
Nobody likes to have their wages and benefits rolled back.
And it's unconscionable to put out this proposal after all the concessions these workers made.
What's your reaction?
- What's next?
- No further comments on that.
LEWIE: All I can do is take a peek at their vaults and see if there's any money.
If there is, we all run in there, we grab as much of it as we can, and we get the hell out.
Negotiations have broke off.
There are no further meetings scheduled.
LEWIE: That's pure, unadulterated bullshit!
What's holding up a contract settlement is that these bastards won't give you a decent wage!
That's what holding up the settlement!
Send your bargaining committee to Chicago with a vote of confidence that supports them and tells the company to stick their proposal where the sun don't shine and give us a decent contract!
Thank you very much.
JIM: Sometimes you have to fire the people up to send a clear message to management that the workers are really ticked off.
That they not only want what's right, they want more than what's right.
You better be prepared to give a lot back that was taken away!
Or you four can start looking for another job!
You want to come back to these meetings?
I worked out in that plant, and I busted my ass for you for over 18 years on production.
All of a sudden, you put the hammer down, and we go from our $10.69 down to $6.50 to walk back in that plant on a Monday.
You want to come back?
You keep your mouth shut, okay?
You don't know what you're talking about!
I won't take it anymore!
I won't have the courtesy of letting you ask questions.
I'll walk out the next time you open your mouth.
LEWIE: The more that the membership seems unreasonable, the more the bargaining committee seems unreasonable, the tougher they are...
Hello.
LEWIE: The more the employer has to rely on you as the negotiator, because you're the one, supposedly, that has to make common sense prevail.
I'd like to carve out numbers one and two and continue to talk with you to see if there's something we can do, but I haven't come up with anything.
LEWIE: You only do that once you have extracted the maximum from that employer.
And then you let the membership decide.
[ Crowd booing ]
They stole my check!
LEWIE: That's a danger when you fire the troops up, is that you get their expectations so high and they believe those expectations can be met.
If you don't meet them, they believe you haven't done your job and may believe you sold them out.
We can't afford to go backwards anymore.
We've went back far enough.
We work too goddamn hard down there to have to go backwards anymore.
I say, "Fuck them."
If they want to close it down, let them close it.
We can all find something else.
We're decent human beings, and we deserve every damn thing we get.
LEWIE:
If you take workers who feel that they're been mistreated or misused, they want to get at the heart of the matter.
They want to get to that employer.
It's their obligation to give it to us.
If they don't want to, then piss on them. Let them go.
Look, between both of you, you want a strike.
You keep snapping at everything for one.
- lf you want one.
- MAN: Some results, Lewie.
You think it's us?
I can't deliver, and I don't intend to carry this on.
I can't deliver something that's not there at this time.
I've been banging around.
Quit looking for somebody to run in with a fucking white horse!
You don't even know what negotiations is all about, and you act like you know everything!
I did not come here and act like I know everything, Lewie!
Our members are asking for some answers, Lewie!
Give your members some answers!
Don't lay the shit on me!
The easiest goddamn thing to do is blame somebody for the problem you're in!
We didn't blame you for the problem we're in.
LEWIE: The biggest and most powerful threat that you have is the threat of a strike.
When you actually have to use the strike, then you are going into an all-out war.
And you have to pick your fights.
If I get emotional.
I seem tired about this.
This is not jerk-off time.
This is serious business.
You better be able to inflict some economic damage on that employer.
If you cannot get into his pockets and take a lot of money out and make the employer understand that it's better to settle than it is to fight, then the employer will crush you.
Hormel's production has not been stopped.
The company shifted production to their other plants
that are still in operation.
In Austin, they are using their own management personnel
to turn out thousands of cans of Spam a day.
MAN: It's got to be blatantly obvious to everyone that this company doesn't want a contract.
MAN #2:
We're at the crossroads.
JIM:
I want to win.
MAN: I don't think there's a guy who don't want to win.
That's no excuse for doing something you shouldn't.
All I'm saying is, whatever it takes to win,
I want to do it.
LEWIE: That, potentially, is a time bomb that can blow up in all of our faces.
The company is gonna end up forcing a settlement on those people out there.
That is gonna be way under the Hormel chain settlement and under the Oscar Mayer settlement.
Here you're gonna have this big company, very profitable, that has got a substandard agreement that's gonna tear the shit out of our rates in the industry.
We are gonna negotiate shit if they get stuck with a bad settlement up there.
MAN:
You people are believing that we've got the power to get them to the table.
It is my assessment that the reason that we have been unsuccessful, the reason that our strategy hasn't worked, the reason that we've gone to a 4-1/2-month strike, is simply that very issue.
We don't have the strength to get them there.
The division that some have tried to create here has been to our downfall.
And I just wish that we could act concerted.
The fact is, I think we all realize right now the company is in a very solid and very legal position to start that packinghouse up without us if we don't go back to work.
Now, I think that the rank and file here has been misled in understanding this company's position.
The problem is, Jim, the company isn't gonna talk to you, period.
They've got a grudge against you.
You probably got a grudge against them.
And I don't care if we offer to go back for 5 bucks an hour.
The company ain't gonna talk to you.
Why don't you talk to them?
Because I'm not part of the negotiating board. That's why.
WOMAN:
You're out of order!
Hey, you can rule me out of order all you want.
I'm gonna tell you one thing.
Rule me out of order all you want.
JIM:
Security?
Did you call 911?
Get them in here.
Get them in here.
MAN:
Will you sit down?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Back off, you guys!
I relent!
If you have come to fight and not get any damn answers, continue!
Otherwise, sit down!
It's a union meeting!
We have said until we're blue in the face.
I don't know how we say it again.
We have gone as far as we're going to go.
If you want to go into negotiations and that means you're going to get more and more, no.
We're not going to give any more.
10 bucks.
They don't even want to talk about it anymore?
- Nope.
- Other than asking questions.
Yep.
There's no bargaining whatsoever?
You think you're winning.
I don't think you're winning.
The company, I don't think, thinks you're winning.
You're at war, they're at war, and they're not giving in.
The contract that you work under is your decision alone.
The Executive Board has recommended rejection.
I have a family like you have.
And I want to be able to say to them, as Hubert Humphrey said,
"I'd rather live 50 years like a tiger than 100 years like a chicken. "
NYBERG: We've got a $100 million plant that needs to be run.
We're taking applications tomorrow from people that want to work in that plant.
And if Local P-9 says,
"We are going to continue to withhold our labor," now the process is underway.
The union will have rights to their jobs until they've been permanently replaced.
No bills today.
When you got a place like this, we got 4-3/4 acres and house and lived here seven years.
And payments are, you know, a couple hundred dollars a month.
I got a wife and three kids, and I love them.
They'll understand later.
If it comes down to losing this place, we'll survive, just like a lot of people.
I got to give R.J. credit.
At least he made a stand, you know.
He put himself on one side or the other.
I'm on the side that's commonly referred to as the P-10ers.
That was my choice.
R.J. decided he wanted to follow
Ray Rogers and Jim Guyette.
It's a hard decision to make for some people, but it wasn't for me when we took that strike vote.
Go out there and be willing to give up things and make things better for us workers and workers around the
United States, union people.
We're tired of going backwards.
But then you have to look at the rest of the economy.
Throughout the nation, that's what's happening.
And I guess maybe you have to swallow hard, but if you want a job...
You're gonna have to take it,
I guess, a little bit.
NARRATOR: So, are you having problems with your brother?
Oh, I won't have any problems, really, until he crosses that line, to scab.
There's nothing worse than a scab, so how can you have anything to do with a scab?
You guys have been giving in and giving in for 23 years.
And we got unions all over the country watching us, counting on us.
People are counting on us.
RON:
To hell with them.
You know, we got
1,400 workers here.
We got thousands of people counting on us
And sending in money, you know.
But it's our job.
It's not theirs.
We knew this strike was coming.
We should've avoided it.
They didn't want to talk.
The International said,
"It's ill-advised.
You're on a suicide mission."
They told us that.
MAN: So far, I think
I've seen about five.
Let's see one, two...
Three, four...
Five, six...
I think I've seen seven.
I had to come today.
I had to know what it'd be like to see people coming into the place that
I spent my whole life in, going in and doing my job.
It's really, really hard to watch this happen.
I'm never gonna let myself get in a position like this again, where a group of a minority of assholes dictate how I handle the rest of my life.
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.
I'll tell you there will be no blocking of the ingress and egress of that plant.
That plant will operate.
The state police will come down on them and crush them.
You can't win that fight there.
If the police can't do it, then they'll bring the National Guard in.
That will demoralize the piss out of them.
They'll be standing there,
3 people every 50 feet with their dick in their hands, watching people take their jobs.
Now, that is very demoralizing.
[ Laughter ]
All right!
Look, you got to do it and be effective.
MAN:
I'd like to know how many people think they could get up at 3:30, 4:00, whenever the traffic comes in, and do it.
I'm ready right now.
All right, then let's do it
Friday morning!
Let's do it!
Then we'll see you at 4:00 in the morning!
[ Cheers and applause ]
[ Car horns honking ]
MAN ON RADIO: We might mention, if you are driving in the area, you will be diverted away from the plant, westbound.
If you're moving up the east side of the Hormel plant, you will be asked to turn your car around and go back.
MAN #2: We just heard from the
Austin Law Enforcement Center that all the roads surrounding the Hormel company itself have been blocked off.
MAN #3: We'll get further reports, Dan-o. Thank you.
One thing we should probably tell everybody.
If the police ask who's in charge, nobody's in charge.
Nobody's in charge.
No one's in charge!
It's cold out today.
God!
There's gonna be a lot of cars that's gonna freeze up.
If anybody comes, the police come and ask who's in charge, there's no one in charge!
There just happens to be a breakdown and a traffic jam.
So there's nobody in charge here!
MAN: If there's any interference with our police duties, we do not want to make arrests.
WOMAN: I lost eight hours' pay today because of that.
[ Crowd groaning ]
And while that might not seem like a lot to the P-9 members who have been on strike for 5 months, it wasn't a thing
I chose to do without.
I have every right to go in and do my job, just as they have every right to picket.
Mr. Mayor, this isn't a hostage situation.
This isn't Tehran, Iran.
This is Austin, Minnesota.
They told us that they would not let us in.
That is a lockout!
Don't be mad at us.
Blame it on the people causing the problem.
That's across the tracks.
It's them that put you in this position, because they put us in this position.
We don't know who's going in there to do what, so to stop it, we had to stop everybody that goes in that plant.
We had to close it down.
I don't want to merit right or wrong.
I'm not gonna pick sides.
But I got a question.
Is what the company's doing...
I don't want to discuss moralities.
Is what the company doing legal?
They're not out there because they like to holler and fight and they want to kill somebody.
They're out
'cause they want a contract where they can go to work.
We want to work.
This is a tragedy for all of us.
I was born and raised here.
Members of my family that are buried here.
These people are my friends on all sides of this issue.
I've graduated from high school with them.
I went to college with some of these people.
This isn't some impersonal thing.
We're personally involved whether we want to be or not.
We would do anything in our power to try to resolve this.
It's a difficult situation for both Chief Hoffman and I to deal with.
I can't tell you what it's like.
It's tearing us up.
MAN:
Left! Left!
Left, right, left!
Left! Left!
Left, right, left!
Minnesota governor
Rudy Perpich called the National Guard, trying to help maintain order, as striking union meatpackers and their supporters blockaded the Hormel plant in Austin, Minnesota.
- Hey, your clubs are cracked!
- Holy shit! Look at them go!
Behind the barricades.
MAN: I don't know if you know, but this is your community, not two or three of them greedy executives!
What the hell's the matter with you? Shut it down!
Shut her down!
I want, no matter what happens, if anybody gets hit, if anybody gets hit, you simply try to identify who it is, but get back to that hall!
Wait a minute.
You see what they got here?
There ain't no way you got a chance on dealing with those clubs!
So you better think rationally!
I don't want to see you in a fight with the National Guard!
Okay, remember, if anybody moves on you, just go back to the office.
There's varying opinions from everyone here as to how many people are gonna cross the line.
But it sounds as though you're gonna have a stampede situation.
If what everybody is reflecting is accurate.
MAN:
Let's get our people and tell 'em the straight shot, like they deserve.
We got lots of folks that are gonna go in there tomorrow because the Guard's gonna let everybody in.
So let's all go back in tomorrow.
I don't think there's gonna be that many going in tomorrow.
I don't think we've shown our last shot.
I'm not ready to give up.
- No.
- Shit, not me.
I got some real problems because I can see tomorrow and you guys can't.
But, boy, that's what makes me sick.
Go home and take a couple aspirin.
You'll feel better in the morning.
Jesus Christ,
I won't feel a bit better.
Left, left, right, left.
I've been out of work for six years. I need a job.
NARRATOR:
How have you been getting by?
Just doing odd jobs.
Must be hard. You ever worked in a packinghouse?
No.
- Where are you from?
- McIntyre.
- How'd you hear about it?
- Been on the news.
I got neighbors that work here.
Does it feel hard to go across the picket line?
No.
- Scab!
- Hey, you lowlife!
When you go across that line, that's your decision.
You just don't let it bother you.
You'd better be able to stand it, or you should have never went across.
NARRATOR:
Why are you doing this?
Because I need a job.
When was the last time you worked?
Oh, last spring.
- Where are you from?
- Austin.
Okay.
You're crossing a picket line!
You're a scab!
Hey, scab, go home!
Go home, scab!
JIM: Some people may be looking for excuses to cross.
But remember that your self-respect will be left behind if anyone decides to cross the picket line.
You know, my family is starving.
I'm not getting a thing from anybody other than $40 a week, just like everybody else in here.
I want my job, just like everybody in here wants their job.
I'm seriously considering crossing.
I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't.
Don't do it!
I didn't say I was.
I said I was considering.
What I'm saying is, a lot of you people, and you'd be liars if you say you didn't, haven't considered crossing.
Because we all need jobs.
What plan of action is everybody here looking for?
I think we're all looking for some plan of action.
Either we gotta shut down every plant that Hormel owns Monday morning.
Or Tuesday or Wednesday we might as well all go back if we don't shut down their goddamn plants and shut 'em down fast.
I think that you guys can't keep going and saying, "l agree."
The company says they're not gonna meet.
The company says they're not gonna give.
They're not gonna give Monday, not Tuesday, not Wednesday.
And all that time, you got some more guys going in, and so what we're all saying is you gotta either shut down the other plants
or, like you said, all go in en masse and work without a contract.
But it's gotta be one or the other.
It can't be dragged out and waiting for the company to give you something.
They told you they ain't gonna give you anything else.
Now we're looking at shutting the other operations down.
Don't you feel that that's a much more pressurizing strategy on this company at this time?
Especially in light of the fact that those people know that whatever happens here is gonna happen to them.
We need to communicate that.
Mm-hmm.
Don't you think that that's a better position to be into?
If you can't shut them down completely, you've accomplished nothing, other than getting a whole lot of people fired and out of work.
What I'm saying to you is, at what cost are you prepared to take roving pickets to that plant?
What are you gonna do when they say,
"You screwed me out of a job.
Now what are you gonna do?"
I'll say it. Hell, there's nothing we can do for them.
That's the risk we take.
Not we take.
They take.
Okay.
It's the risk they take.
We all take.
Yeah, we took it willingly, and we took it to start with.
Now for our fight, we're dragging them in.
JIM: When does the realization come to those folks that our fight is indeed their fight?
When are we gonna do it if we don't do it now?
Mr. Nyberg, what will Hormel do if P-9 sets up picket lines at your other plants?
Our employees know that it is our position that they'd be in violation of the contracts if they voluntarily stay out and honor the picket line of Local P-9 or however many pickets there might be.
We know that if they do stay out that they will be subject to replacement just as employees in Austin are subject to replacement.
The Executive Board of Local P-9
decided to recommend that the picket line be extended
to all other Hormel plants in an attempt to shut them down.
With that came the promise that if anyone at the other plants
got fired for honoring
P-9's picket line,
no P-9ers would return to their jobs
until the company agreed to rehire everyone.
You know, when you talk about being illegal, at one time, it was illegal to go out on strike.
At one time, it was illegal to join a union.
I guess at one time, it was illegal for America to even exist.
The Executive Board has passed a motion.
Roving pickets will be sent to other plants.
If this is approved, it'll send a message to the company, to everyone else.
We made a promise.
We swore we'd always remember.
No retreat, no surrender.
Speaking on the motion...
It's a unanimous
Executive Board recommendation.
All those in favor signify by saying "aye."
CROWD:
Aye!
Those opposed.
Ayes have it.
I repeat.
This is a union picket line.
We ask that you do not cross it.
Take the day off.
One damn day is all we ask.
All Hormel plants will be shut up tight as a drum by Friday.
There will be none running, to our knowledge.
We'd appreciate your support.
Go home and have a cup of coffee.
Go talk to Ma and the kids before they go to school.
MAN:
There's no way on God's creation that I'm gonna cross their picket line!
When I looked at a guy
I worked with for seven years.
I live in the same town he does,
22 miles up the road.
And I said to him,
"How do you feel?"
He said, "My heart's pumping."
I looked at another guy
I worked with for seven years.
I said, "How do you feel?"
He said, "My heart's pumping."
I said, "Guess what?
You're union people."
We ain't crossing no picket lines!
We ain't crossing them!
What miracle do we expect to happen in the next three days?
That's the question.
What miracle?
How or why?
We have tremendous spirit, we've got a wonderful program.
And we seem to think that if we just go one day at a time, like an alcoholic.
Just keep the strike going one more day, and after today's over, it'll keep going tomorrow.
What do we expect is gonna happen?
I'm mystified.
Scabs!
Go back to your own town, scabs!
Asshole! Go to hell!
I hope you rot in hell!
You're the one that really hurts, Steve.
All these other guys are dicks.
When you went across there, you really hurt.
What the hell's the matter with you?
How can you work with those scabs?
Doesn't it bother you to go in there with guys like that?
Then you got no class.
I don't know you.
Who's your smiley partner?
I've known that guy since we were in grade school.
It's killing him inside.
He's told me that.
I tried to talk him out of it.
He said no.
It's what he had to do.
My wife and children have been my backbone.
They've just.
"No way."
They knew in their minds that if I did,
I couldn't live with myself.
RON: If things haven't changed substantially in two or three days,
I will base my decision on the fact that my family is number one in my life, not my union.
NARRATOR: Are you gonna go across the picket line?
So it appears it.
At this stage of the game, well, it would be tough, but I can't see any alternative.
Now that we've been working on this for a year and a half trying to figure out the difference between right and wrong,
I believe that I was a dupe,
I was lied to originally.
And now he's got control of my whole life.
On the other hand, it's a question of morality, because I was brought up that you do not cross a picket line, no matter what.
It's something that you do not do.
Because you don't belong to a union all these years and develop all these principles.
It isn't like a dollar bill.
You can't throw it on the ground and be rid of it.
As much as I want my job back,
I've still been a good union member for many years.
But I don't know.
My family comes first.
My daughter goes to work.
She's got a part-time job.
My boy, he works at McDonald's, part-time job.
My wife goes to work.
She's got a job.
And what do I do? I sit home, and I play with the cat.
What kind of provider is that?
It may sound corny, but a person takes pride in being a breadwinner and providing for your family.
When you can't do that, when you say to them,
"All I want to do is work," and they...
It's tough.
But I spent more than we should have.
But I want to go back to work.
And the hell with P-9.
I'm ready.
NARRATOR:
Is that hard for you?
You bet.
Why?
Not being able to -- excuse me.
[ Voice breaking ]
Provide for my family.
[ Crying ]
I just can't talk no more.
You're scared to see all them people you've worked with.
All these people are standing there hollering at you.
Yet, you know you have to go across. there's some in there, you think,
"I don't care if you ever come back."
You see people you talk to every day, and it almost makes you cry.
There are some good friends of mine.
That's the ones you feel like you're betraying.
- Where you guys going?
- To work.
- You got a pass for that?
- You want to see our cards?
Just Hormel cards?
You want to see them?
Yeah.
You new employees?
No, no. Not by any stretch of the imagination.
WOMAN: To some, staying out no longer makes sense.
There is more here than a town divided, as brother watches brother cross the line in a place not big enough for anyone to hide for very long.
He won't be my brother if he crosses the line.
For me, it wasn't tough to get to the point of the gate.
I was ready.
But the minute we crossed that line, part of me just stayed back there.
Well, unionism, to me, is watching out not only for your own job, but you're an organization for the welfare and benefit of all the workers.
And now, you know, for this moment, we aren't.
Because we left them.
You know, I wasn't always
International president.
I used to work in the grocery stores, you know.
And I know what it is to work for peanuts.
And you think I like the fact that our people got to roll their wages back a bit?
I don't.
But I tell you what.
I don't take people over a cliff.
There's an old rule in the labor movement.
Anybody can put people on the street.
It takes a man to put them back to work. I'm sorry.
It takes a man or a woman to put them back to work.
Now is the time to settle it.
Hopefully, we can work it out through the course of our local union.
If we don't, then in a short period of time, I'll settle it.
- Question.
- I'll settle it.
- How will you settle it?
- I told you I'll settle it.
I have a meeting.
Thank you.
The United Food and Commercial
Workers Union ordered 1,000 members of its meatpackers local to end their bitter seven-month strike against Hormel in Austin, Minnesota.
The International Union said it had lifted its sanction of the walkout and cut off $40-a-week benefits to strikers.
But pickets remained in place through the day.
WOMAN: It is a strike, those on the line say, is becoming symbolic of the struggle to keep trade unions alive.
If they end up operating that plant nonunion and your guys never get back in there, will you consider that a big defeat for you?
Or not?
Number one, if I say there's no way I could look at this as a defeat, then you're gonna say,
"How can you say that?
Now, you either win or you're gonna lose."
And let's talk about what has happened here and about the types of victory and defeat you can have.
If all the workers lose their job here, okay, if that's a scenario that you're playing, yeah, that is certainly a defeat that way.
But when you consider the fight these people have fought.
Are you saying that 1,000 guys lose their jobs, and because they've got intense national attention on these important problems that confront labor, that could still be a victory?
No, what I am saying, there's been a set of dynamics that has occurred both with all the people in this area, within this community, and within the labor movement.
That cannot be considered anything but positive.
JIM:
I think that we at P-9 started this small labor dispute.
It quickly escalated into a labor dispute that represented a lot of things.
Taking on one of the corporate giants in an industry.
Taking on one of the largest international unions in the country.
And really recognizing the forces that working people have to deal with.
If a small union in the middle of a cornfield in Minnesota can do the kinds of things we do...
We just need to get about the business of doing it.
LEWIE: I don't believe the membership elects leaders to be heroes at their expense.
Talks about dignity and everybody going back together.
What dignity is there when you don't have a job?
There's no dignity at all.
In June of 1986,
the International took over the local union
and threw out the elected leadership of Local P-9.
The main things that the order covers is if anybody physically confronts the UFCW, if they remove assets, or if they hold themselves out to be representing Local P-9 rather than just saying they're a member of P-9.
Do I have to say I'm suspended?
The order's pretty clear on that.
I got to say I'm suspended?
The International Union
negotiated a settlement with Hormel,
whereby the people who crossed the picket line
would receive the same wages and benefits as workers
at the other Hormel plants.
$10.25 per hour.
We didn't stand by the company.
We stood by the International Union.
Kiss my ass!
Kiss my ass!
You're full of shit.
You went back to save your ass and save your job.
By God, we needed our jobs.
We took our chances with Hormel with the hope that unionism would somehow survive.
We left the union and we went back to our jobs.
That's where it was.
[ Booing and jeering ]
Go ahead.
You can scream and holler.
Get that out of your system.
Then we can proceed.
There's one part in the contract that I must have missed.
It's the part that says they have to take me and the rest of all these guys back.
This is the way I feel.
Hormel's will never take me back unless I put it in the contract or you put it in the contract.
And if that's not in the contract, all this bullshit of a contract don't mean nothing to me.
Because how many days' vacation or how much of this they get.
I don't get none of it, because
I didn't get back in the plant.
The contract did not contain any provisions
for the people who honored the picket line.
These people were placed on a waiting list.
It's time, and I think you people have realized, too.
Had we pulled together two years ago,
I don't think you or us would be faced with this.
But I think it's the thing that's going on in America, and I think we as men and women have to realize we better start pulling together, or, by God, they're gonna bury us.
Part of why it's gonna be so hard to leave is because I'm gonna have to leave my mom and dad.
My dad's still out on strike, and I feel like
I'm abandoning him, almost.
But we feel like we have to get on with our lives for the kids.
They need a normal atmosphere they can grow up in.
I know my dad will be okay,
'cause he's a survivor.
And he knows that we're still behind him 100%.
We're not abandoning him.
We're just taking our fight somewhere else.
As far as the strike goes, it was time.
It was past time.
Mike took a stand and refused to go across the picket line.
I'm glad he wouldn't, because
I wouldn't have wanted him to.
LEWIE: You hear this business of "Old Jay Hormel, if he was around, things wouldn't run this way," or "We got this new crop of executives, and they've changed the direction."
They didn't change nothing.
Hormel changed because it was to their advantage to change.
They realized there was profits and growth by pursuing this strategy.
And they did it.
All of a sudden, they're not benevolent anymore and they're not so paternalistic.
They become barracudas, just like everybody else.
We can't look to unions and say,
"You gotta stop this."
It's gonna take a combination of outrage from people.
Whether you support a union or you don't, is it right for these companies to do this?
It can't be dealt with just on the picket line and just at the bargaining table.
You're not looking at short-term fixes here.
When the union's inspiration
Through the workers' blood shall run
There will be no power greater
Anywhere beneath the sun
Yet, what force on Earth is weaker
Than the feeble strength of one
And the union makes us strong
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
And the union makes us strong
In our arms is placed a power
Greater than their hoarded gold
Greater than the might of armies
Magnified a thousand fold
We can bring together the new world
From the ashes of the old
And the union makes us strong
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
And the union makes us strong
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
If I don't draw for a while,
I get really crazy.
I start feeling depressed and suicidal if I don't get to draw.
But sometimes when I'm drawing,
I feel suicidal, too.
What are you trying to get at in your work?
Jesus!
I don't know.
I don't work in terms of conscious messages. I can't do that.
It has to be something...
I'm revealing to myself while
I'm doing it, which is hard to explain.
Which means that while I'm doing it,
I don't know exactly what it's about.
You have to have the courage to take that chance.
What's gonna come out?
What's coming out of this?
I enjoy drawing.
It's a deeply ingrained habit.
It's all because of my brother Charles.
Hello, Mother?
I'm in Philadelphia.
I'm going to give a talk at the art school downtown tomorrow.
So Terry and this film crew are here with me.
They'd like to come over and drop me off there... and talk possibly to Charles... about maybe filming him if you're not...
He doesn't want to do it?
Okay.
All right.
That's okay.
Doesn't matter.
Not if you don't want him to.
I certainly won't...
All right. Bye.
Well, that's that.
I start with this one... because it's probably the thing
I'm most well-known for.
You could see it for a long time on truck mud flaps.
I don't know why it caught the popular imagination.
It caused me nothing but headaches for ten years after I drew it: lawsuits and I.R.S. problems.
It was a nightmare just because of this stupid ‘‘Keep on truckin’’.
So don't anybody come to me and say,
‘‘Hey, R.! Keep on truckin!’’
This is probably the next thing...
I'm most well-known for.
I'm trying to hook you in to who I am.
This sold millions of copies.
I got $600... from CBS records in 1968.
And they kept my artwork.
They stole my artwork, those bastards.
I heard recently that the original of this... sold at Sotheby's for $21,000.
This is the third thing
I'm the most well-known for... because this was made into a major full-length animated cartoon... which was an embarrassment to me for the rest of my life.
I have to say I had nothing to do with the cartoon.
I didn't want them to do it.
I thought they were schlockmeisters.
They just rolled right over me.
So I had this character killed in a later story. I had a female ostrich... stab him in the head with an ice pick.
When I first met him, he never talked, he just drew.
He was catatonic, and the only voice he had was his pen.
He was very productive.
My mother thought he was retarded when she met him.
She said, ‘‘Some people like cripples, some like retards.’’
She thought I was a real creep when she first met me.
He's more comfortable after knowing the same people for a long time.
He's a little more communicative... but still he clams up.
He gets stilted in his conversation around anybody he doesn't know well.
That's why I'm such an exciting subject for a movie.
Right.
Watch out with those weights.
- Don't hit me with those things.
- Don't go behind me.
These rich rednecks have moved out here and built their dream homes... on the top of every single hill.
There used to be nothing over here.
Then these people bought this property.
- They might hear you.
- Look at this house.
- Not too loud.
- Right above our house.
- Looks right into Robert's studio.
- Be quiet.
I don't care if they hear me.
Couldn't be any ruder than them putting their house right above mine.
What do I care?
I guess not, since we're moving to France, what do you care?
They have a plan to widen this road and put it through where these trees are.
There's a big X that the surveyors sprayed on here... and I erased it the other day.
Then I took out their sticks from the other side of the road.
They're going to widen this road... and take a big chunk of land out of that side with all these trees.
Put 12 dream homes back in there.
We decided to chain ourselves to these oak trees if they try and take them out.
Our house is so humble nestled against the hill. Tasteful.
All these other houses are oriented to look down at our place... because it's like a backdrop for their air-conditioned nightmare houses.
Each hilltop can view each other hilltop. The shmucks.
I'm drawing portraits of girls I had crushes on in high school in Delaware.
This one I'm drawing now is Winona Newhouse... affectionately known among the boys as ‘‘The Shelf’’.
She had this phenomenal rear shelf.
She was nice, too, actually.
She was kind to me.
This one here, Naomi Wilson... was this cross-eyed farm girl that wore homemade clothes.
I secretly had a crush on her.
I was sexually attracted to her.
Of course, you'd never dare admit it openly... that you like this funky girl that had B.O. and hairy legs.
That's Jean Strahle. I liked her, too.
She was also considered a dork.
She was a bookwormy type that talked with a lisp... and had shapely, powerful legs.
I never actually had any contact with these girls... except I used to play footsie with this one.
Where are they now?
Thirty years ago.
They're all middle-aged housewives now.
Jesus, what a thought.
Winona. I wish she was here now... this 17-year-old Winona... instead of this film crew.
When I listen to old music, it's one of the few times...
I actually have a kind of love for humanity.
You hear the best part of the soul of the common people.
It's their way of expressing... their connection to eternity or whatever you want to call it.
Modern music doesn't have that calamitous loss.
People can't express themselves that way anymore.
It was late 1948... when I was five years old, we moved to this section of Philadelphia.
This is this project that we lived in.
I can't remember which we lived in.
They all look the same.
Jesus. It's grim here.
Oh, my God! This is where we went to the market.
There was a dime store that sold toys there.
We used to buy candy and stuff and comic books.
The three brothers, me, Charles and Maxon, hung around together a lot.
We'd rummage for stuff in the dump.
One time Charles brought this thing back from the dump.
It was this beautiful wooden truck.
Like an ice cream truck made of wood.
I wanted it really bad.
He wouldn't let me touch it.
He was spiteful that way.
So I made a big fuss, and I told my mother.
She said, ‘‘Charles, let him play with that.’’
He said, ‘‘Okay.’’
About 15 minutes later, he said,
‘‘Okay, you can play with it now.’’
I ran outside, and he had smashed it to smithereens against the wall.
Charles, you read any good books lately?
Yeah, I guess I have.
I don't know.
You seem to be recycling a lot of these books.
What do you mean by ‘‘recycling’’?
You read them 20 years ago.
Now you're reading them again.
I'm reading them again. Yeah.
I do that because there's nothing else to do.
You've read them all.
You ever read anything new?
I haven't read Kant or Hegel.
- You have any interest in that stuff?
- Maybe I'll get around to reading them.
- You read any recent writers?
- Not really, no.
- Not interested in them?
- Most aren't that good or interesting.
They're not as interesting as the Victorian writers... of the late 19th century.
I always kind of envied your life in a way.
My life has become so hectic.
Why? Because I was so detached from the human race?
Is that one of the reasons why you envy me?
This cloistered environment with your books.
Believe me, it's nothing to envy.
Charles started this comic thing.
He was completely obsessed with comics when we were kids... and had absolutely no other normal kid interest.
He wasn't interested in toys or games.
He didn't play sports.
He didn't do anything but read comics, draw comics, think comics and talk them.
I like drawing, but I had other drawing interests besides comics.
I liked to draw realistic scenes... just pictures of buildings and cars and stuff.
He wasn't interested in that at all.
It was only comics.
This is the earliest one that still exists that I have. Charles drew this.
That's supposed to be me, and that's him.
You made me feel absolutely worthless if I wasn't drawing comics.
I don't think I would have done that.
I don't think I was as far gone as that.
Maybe I was just unconsciously imitating the old man.
- What was he like?
- My father was an overbearing tyrant.
Yes, he was.
Maybe I was unconsciously imitating him when I forced you to draw comic books.
There's still a kind of sibling rivalry between me and Robert... like there was when we were kids and he was still living at home.
I think basically Robert and I are still competing with each other.
It's like when I'm drawing comics,
I still think of Charles' approval... whether or not he's going to like them.
Charles had everybody drawing comics in the family.
‘‘The Animal Town Publishing Company.’’
That was a club we had... where we sat around and talked about comics.
I was usually the president.
Robert was usually the vice president.
Carol was usually the secretary... and Sandy was the treasurer and Maxon was the supply boy.
And he still resents that.
He still resents the fact we imposed the role of supply boy on him.
Max Crumb in room 310?
Maxon was the scapegoat in the family.
Of five kids, he was definitely on the bottom of the heap.
Just to explain... we had these meetings for this club
Charles put together called...
The Animal Town Comics Club.
Something to do with comics.
Everybody had their job, a secretary, a president, a vice president.
I was supply boy.
I got it more heavy or direct than
Robert, but there was the whole thing.
It was like a crazy sibling thing between me, Charles and Robert... in this room upstairs... and the world didn't know what the fuck was going on.
It was like three primordial monkeys working it out in the trees.
Me and Maxon slept in the same bed until we were 16 or something.
Very intimate, close situation.
Charles was inspired by the Disney movie... where Robert Newton plays
Long John Silver.
After we saw it on TV in 1955... we started playing pirates like normal kids do.
We'd go out and pretend.
We made this ship out of an old refrigerator carton.
Charles would walk around town dressed up like Long John Silver.
He had this old coat of my mother's, this long, green coat.
He made himself a three-cornered hat out of some woman's hat.
He had a crutch, and he'd tie up his leg and go around town that way.
I didn't realize how fixated Charles was on ‘‘Treasure Island’’ till years later.
This thing dominated our play and our fantasy for six or seven years.
We drew these comics... about ‘‘Treasure Island, ’' and it became this real Baroque, elaborate thing... way beyond the original Disney film.
This is one of Charles'.
This is one of our two-man comics in which he would draw... some of the characters and I would draw some and have them interact.
That was a great school of cartooning for me... having to come up with clever retorts to him.
He was actually much cleverer and funnier than I was.
It got tiresome, but you had to do it.
He was in charge.
I had this very definite, bad problem about Charles.
I think a lot of it had to do with my morbid sensitivity to the guy... as well as his natural affinity to get in there and profit off it.
Robert was somewhat of a middleman.
It had this way of restricting... or causing this terrible self-consciousness in me as a kid.
I was morbidly modest about my body.
Sex was completely removed.
When it came time for me to become sexually aware when I was in puberty...
Sex was nowhere near in my life.
I had absolutely nothing to do with it.
Sex was so heavily repressed.
That's when the seizures started.
I had a seizure. And a seizure's like a point where your behavior becomes...
I'd have to get into the whole sex trip, which is an awful involved topic.
All I thought about when I was in my late teens and early 20s was sex.
I masturbated about four or five times a week. How frequently did you...
I don't masturbate anymore now that my sexual desires are completely dead.
Like I told you,
I can't get an erection anymore.
My God!
I don't know whether it's one thing or a combination of things.
Maybe a combination of the medication and lack of external stimulation.
Maybe approaching old age has something to do with it. Who knows?
You need some external stimulation to keep up your interest.
Now that my sexual desires are gone,
I'm not sure I want them back again.
My earliest sexual memories?
I remember being like four years old and getting erections.
I guess my aunt or my mother's sister...
Humping her legs and her shoes like under the table.
I remember going in my mother's closet.
She had cowboy boots... she wore when it rained... and humping those in the closet.
And I remember singing while doing it.
Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
I remember... when I was about five or six
I was sexually attracted to Bugs Bunny.
I cut out this Bugs Bunny off the cover of a comic book... and carried it around with me in my pocket... and took it out and looked at it periodically.
It got wrinkled from handling.
I asked my mother to iron it to flatten it out.
She did, and I was deeply disappointed because it got all brown and brittle... and it crumbled apart.
What was it about Bugs Bunny that you found exciting?
I had this sexual attraction to cute cartoon characters.
You tell me!
I don't know.
That all changed when I turned 12, and I became fixated on Sheena.
‘‘Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, ’' a TV show around '55, '56.
I became totally obsessed with Sheena and went to bed every night... thinking about the things
I wanted to do with Sheena.
Robert was very hung up on sex when he was a little kid... even more so than I was.
- I was? You think so?
- Yeah.
You were more inhibited as a child than I was, even sexually.
You were more afraid of women than I was as a young person.
When I was in high school,
I had a few dates with girls.
When you were in high school, you didn't have any dates with anybody.
You were actually sort of good-Iooking.
I was a handsome, good-Iooking chap when I was a teenager.
But there was just something that was wrong with my personality.
The teachers hated him, the kids hated him.
High school was an absolute nightmare.
I was the most unpopular kid in the high school.
People were always picking on me and beating me up.
And the girls wouldn't have anything to do with me.
They treated me like I was the scum of the earth.
In this strip, I'm talking all about my problems with women... starting with high school where I learned a lot about women... because there was this guy named Skutch, this guy here... who was like this mean bully... but he was also very charming.
All the girls liked him.
He was the dreamboat... but he was also a bully.
My brother Charles was one of the guys he singled out for particular attention.
He had this gang of flunkies that hung around with him, with Skutch.
So I remember this scene... where Skutch punches out my brother in the hallway at school.
It was a very sad sight for me to see.
Charles gave up trying to be popular or have girlfriends... after everybody saw he couldn't fight back, that he was beat up by Skutch.
I've been living at home since I graduated from high school.
I made a few feeble attempts along the way.
You're no worse off than people that are in the world and have to deal with it.
But you got to take into consideration that I'm taking tranquilizers.
And that makes it a lot easier than it would otherwise be... by taking these tranquilizers and antidepressants.
If it wasn't for them, I'd probably go completely crazy living with Mother.
I have to walk on eggs when I'm around her.
Yeah, you do.
You can't tell my mother the absolute truth.
She's in a heavy state of denial about a lot of things.
I don't think we should be talking about this.
- Where's my kitty cats?
- About her mother, she's...
What the hell's going on?
She doesn't like you to talk about her mother who was a complete monster.
- What?
- Fix that thing in the hallway.
- What thing?
- The window.
What's wrong with it?
- It's some film equipment or something.
- It's some kind of film equipment.
- Where are my kitty cats?
- I don't know.
Don't worry about it. It's all gonna be out of here and back to normal.
Here it shows these girls talking about how one of their friends... got a date with Skutch and how envious they all are.
This is how I felt about it.
I'm a little bitter about it, as you can see.
I show here how I thought that most teenage boys... are very cruel and aggressive.
And if girls could see that I was more kind and sensitive, they would like me.
They were kind of impressed by the fact I could draw.
I couldn't understand why they liked these cruel, aggressive guys and not me.
I was more kind and sensitive, more like them.
I didn't realize they didn't want you to be like them, basically.
I felt very hurt and cruelly misunderstood... because I considered myself talented and intelligent... and yet I was not very attractive physically.
I didn't think those things mattered.
It was what's inside that was important.
When I was 13 and 14 and trying to be a normal teenager, I was really a jerk.
I tried to act like I thought they were acting.
It came out all wrong and weird, so then I stopped completely... and became a shadow,
I wasn't even there.
People weren't aware that I was... in the same world they were in.
That freed me completely because
I wasn't under pressures to be normal.
So I got interested in old-time music, and went to the black section of town... knocking on doors and looking for old records... and things like that that would be unthinkable... if you were going to be a normal teenager.
Starting about 17, I started being driven by that obsession that...
‘‘I'll go down in history as a great artist. That'll be my revenge.’’
This is my image celebrating Valentine's Day.
‘‘February 13, 1962.
I decided to reject conforming when society rejected me.
I've heard all about that 'be yourself' stuff.
When I'm myself, people think I'm nuts.
Guess I'll have to be satisfied with cats and old records.
Girls are just utterly out of my reach.
They won't even let me draw them.’’
All that changed after I got famous.
Absolutely, I would love to pose for you.
Excellent.
Anytime you want to come by and visit, that'd be really nice.
- Excellent.
- I always wanted to see you again.
Some of the early ‘‘Weirdo’’ collages... and also some publications.
We managed to track them down.
I think Crumb... is basically the Brueghel of the last half of the 20th century.
There wasn't a Brueghel of the first half, but there is of the last half.
And that is Robert Crumb... because he gives you that tremendous kind of impassion... of lusting, suffering, crazed humanity... in all sorts of bizarre, gargoyle-like allegorical forms.
He's got this very powerful imagination, which goes over the top a lot... but it very seldom lies.
He's Mr. Natural.
He accepts women how they really are... and makes them even more beautiful than they really...
Like that woman.
I mean, she's really...
She's got energy, form and drive.
You can't push these women around.
They're not wimps.
He gives power to women.
He made it okay for me to have a butt.
He did a drawing of me, which I really liked a lot. It was neat.
It showed my thighs as they really are.
He helped me change my self-image.
I had felt so inadequate before.
It was like I didn't know...
Believe me, Stevayne, you're adequate.
Oh, you're so adequate.
I feel Robert's work... is one of the most pertinent social portraits... of an era... touching issues related to politics... to sex, to drugs, to religion... to the fine arts.
And I would say Robert is the Daumier of our time.
He's a very remarkable artist, indeed.
The tradition that I see him belonging to is, essentially... the one of graphic art as social protest, social criticism... which, of course, has extremely long roots.
There are elements of Goya in Crumb.
Goya's sense of monstrosity... comes out in those menacing bird-headed women of Crumb's for instance.
Robert! In front of all these people?
The undergrounds are alive and well.
Whole industry sprung up.
They're still reprinting the early ones.
Number two, number four.
God only knows how many of those have been printed by now.
‘‘Puke and Explode. '’
It's called ‘‘Puke and Explode’’.
That's new. Who put that out?
I don't know about these kids today.
I guess you really started all this.
You created this whole thing.
You're responsible.
I don't like to take credit for that.
Some of this stuff,
I know nobody would.
I'm a really big fan of yours.
I'm wondering if there's any chance
I can get an autograph from you.
I don't think so.
I don't believe in giving autographs.
Okay, well thanks anyway.
- When are you actually moving?
- Couple months.
France isn't perfect or anything.
But it's slightly less evil than the United States, I think.
But that's not why I'm moving.
Talk to my wife if you want to know why I'm moving.
We do have something here that we wanted to show you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. 1967 rock concert poster.
Extremely rare item.
It’s my only rock concert poster
I ever did.
There's this legend I keep hearing.
People telling me...
‘‘Somebody told me you used to live with the Grateful Dead in Haight Ashbury... and you hung around with Jerry Garcia. '’
I never had anything to do with those guys. I hated that music.
I went to a couple of those rock concerts and just fell asleep.
Found it completely boring, that psychedelic music.
I've got something for you.
I want to tell you a little secret.
It's called ‘‘Om Mani Padme Hum’’.
This is where I get recognized more than anyplace in the world, on Haight Street.
- Amazing.
- I know. These are my people!
People come to me and say,
‘‘R. Crumb!’’
Sometimes some guy will sit with me... and chew my ear off about all his hopes and dreams.
Usually it's some broken-down hippie-pest guy.
It's never like a beautiful young
20-year-old girl.
It's just so interesting to come here and draw people.
That's the main reason I come here, just to watch people.
That girl was sitting here one day.
Beautiful girl.
I drew this other girl.
She came up and wanted the drawing.
So I cut it out, gave it to her.
- Good way to meet girls.
- Right.
I drew this girl.
She invited me to her house.
Unfortunately, she wasn't very attractive.
You kept the picture, I see.
It's ironic that you're so identified with the '60s.
At the time, it didn't seem you fit in with that flower child thing.
I tried!
I used to come here every day and try and be one of them.
My main motivation was, get some of that free love action. but I wasn't too good at it.
People would ask,
‘‘Are you a narc?’’
They would move away from you at the love-in. I look like I do now.
Exactly. You, in effect...
- You did have a costume.
- It wasn't the right costume.
I remember Janis Joplin giving me this piece of advice.
‘‘Crumb, what's the matter with you?
Don't you like girls?’’
I said, ‘‘Of course I like girls.
What do you think?’’
She said, ‘‘Just let your hair grow long, get a satin, billowy shirt... velvet jackets and bell bottoms and platform shoes.
You'll do all right.’’
I just couldn't do that.
The whole thing was too silly to me.
I couldn't get with it.
Here's a real beautiful one.
I should get...
The work in this book, the art, the feelings... are what made me fall in love with Robert.
The way he saw colors and the way he saw women.
When I was 17 years old,
I looked a lot like that.
So I was what he had been drawing.
I was the embodiment of what he had been drawing for years.
It's such a sweet, romantic vision of things.
He did this book.
It took him, I think, a year.
That was his life.
He had just finished the book days before we met.
My parents were always fighting all the time.
I used to say,
‘‘I'm never getting married.’’
My father said, ‘‘You'll marry the first one that comes along.’’ He was right.
Robert always had a sketchbook or two going.
He was constantly drawing.
If we were in a restaurant, he'd draw on the place mat.
If we were on the bus, he'd draw on his bus ticket.
I had this big change in 1965 and '66.
It was visionary.
Very powerful, kind of knock-you-on-your-ass... visionary experience.
This is my sketchbook for 1966 that covers that period.
I took this very weird drug.
Supposedly it was LSD, but it had a really weird effect.
It made my brain all fuzzy.
This effect lasted for a couple of months.
I started getting these images, cartoon characters like this... that I'd never drawn before with these big shoes and everything.
I let go of trying to have any coherent, fixed idea about what I was doing.
I started being able to draw these stream-of-consciousness comic strips.
Just kind of making up stuff.
It didn't have to make any sense.
It could be stupid.
It didn't make any difference.
All the characters that I used for the next several years... came to me during this period.
These fit into this vision I was having.
It was a revelation of some seamy side of America's subconscious.
When I was drawing this, there was this young girl. She was 11.
She said, ‘‘Isn't that cute?’’
To me, it was like a horror show, this whole thing.
And she thought it was really cute and happy looking.
To me, it was like a drawing of the horror of America.
There were these hippie underground papers starting up in '66, '67.
Every town had one or two of them.
They would print anything if it was related to the psychedelic experience... or the hippie ethic.
So I started submitting... these LSD-inspired comics
I had been doing... to these papers, and they liked them.
Then this guy came who suggested
I do a whole issue of his paper.
It was called ‘‘Yarrowstalks’’.
I did that, and that went over big.
He said, ‘‘Why don't you do psychedelic comic books, and I'll publish them?’’
So I set to work, and I did two whole issues of ‘‘Zap Comix’’.
Crumb was incredibly exciting and incredibly hot.
There were just a handful of us... doing this new form of comics.
And what he was doing was just more innovative... than what any of us had even thought of.
It was fun to be a part of that and to see ‘‘Zap’’ suddenly everywhere.
From this concept of Robert's, this fantasy of doing his own comic book... with a glossy cover and actually printed... to seeing it turning up in all the windows on Haight Street, around town... hearing people talk about it... having the other artists show up and wanting to be a part of it.
It happened very quickly. It seems to me it happened in a matter of weeks.
Crumb gave the ownership of ‘‘Zap’’ to the artists. There was no editor.
There was a certain point where it seemed underground comics... could get into the big time... and Crumb always seemed reluctant to push that sort of thing.
They were offering him 100,000 bucks... just to start talking.
Robert turned it down in two seconds.
Aline screamed in the background,
‘‘What are you doing? We need money.’’
Forget it! I'm not going on
‘‘Saturday Night Live’’.
The Rolling Stones wanted me to do an album cover.
A couple other deals like that.
I said ‘‘No.’’
This is not something you see every day in America... where selling out is everybody's ambition.
After about a year of recognition and all the bullshit of fame...
I just said, ‘‘Fuck it’’... and I started drawing the dark part of myself again in the comics... which I'd always kept hidden before.
I was used to what he had been doing... which was really quite sweet.
Then he did this one that was... just incredibly hostile to women... very sexually hostile.
I wasn't expecting it.
I was really shocked and taken aback.
And just kind of like, whack!
It's hard for me to believe... that he can't channel himself into doing better work.
I like a lot of his work. And I don't miss the satirical aspect of it.
Then I have a different reaction.
Perhaps one of being really turned off and disgusted.
And you know this cartoon,
‘‘Joe Blow’’... is one that I thought about a lot in that light.
On the one hand, it's a satire of a 1950s... the healthy facade of the American family.
It kind of exposes the sickness under the surface.
But at the same time you sense... that Crumb is getting off on it himself in some other way.
On another level, it's a self-indulgent orgy in a fantasy.
And the fantasy, specifically, this story... is a story about a father... who commands his daughter to give him a blow job.
She does, and they wind up having sex.
And the little Leave-It-To-Beaver type brother comes running in... and sees the father and his sister, and he's shocked.
He runs to the mother to tell her.
And Mom comes out of a closet wearing a sort of S&M getup.
And the little boy says, ‘‘Oh, cool.’’
The next thing,
Mom and son are having sex.
The whole cartoon ends with the parents saying...
‘‘Gee, we should spend more time with the kids. '’ Very funny.
So you read something like this... and I think that it has gone over the line... from satire of a 1950s... hygienic family in denial... into something which is just Crumb producing pornography.
I think this theme in his work is omnipresent.
It's part of an arrested juvenile vision.
Crumb's material comes out of a deep sense of the absurdity of human life.
At a certain psychic level, there aren't any heroes, villains or heroines.
Even the victims are comic.
It's this which people in America find rather hard to take... because it conflicts with their basic feelings.
That sort of mixture of utopianism on one hand and Puritanism on the other... which is only another kind of utopianism... which has given us the kind of messy discourse that we have today.
So Crumb, like all great satirists, is an outsider in his own country.
Jesus! The fucking raging epithet music... coming out of every car, every store, every person's head.
If they don't have noisy radios, they got earphones on like...
‘‘Motherfuckin' cock suckin' son of a bitch.’’
That's a lot of aggression.
A lot of anger, a lot of rage.
Everybody's walking advertisements.
They've got advertisements on their clothes.
Go walking around with ‘‘Adidas’’ written across their chests... or ‘‘49ers’’ on their hats.
Jesus. It's pathetic.
It's pitiful.
The whole culture's one unified field... of bought, sold, market-researched everything.
It used to be people fermented their own culture.
It took hundreds of years, and it evolved over time.
That's gone in America.
People now don't even have any concept that there ever was... a culture outside of this thing that's created to make money.
Whatever's the biggest, latest thing, they're into it.
You just get disgusted after a while with humanity... for not having more, kind of like... intellectual curiosity about what's behind all this jive bullshit.
Charles and I talk quite a bit about things.
- We don't talk that much.
- Yeah, we do.
We hold aloof from each other for the most part.
You spend all your time watching television... and doing your crossword puzzles.
I don't watch television. I turn it on because it puts me to sleep.
It's a good way to get to sleep.
We're two recluses living in the same house.
I wake up at 3:00 a.m. and it's still on.
You do most of the talking in the relationship, Mother.
There's no doubt about that.
You told me that even though you take medication, you still feel depressed.
Yeah, but not as much as I would if I wasn't taking the medication.
What would happen if you stopped taking that stuff?
I don't know.
I tried it a couple of times... and I didn't like what was starting to happen to me.
- He gets insomnia.
- I felt I was becoming unhinged.
So I got back on them in a big hurry.
I tried this a couple of times, about two or three times.
Do you still think they're picking my brain, Mother?
Yeah.
You have nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of.
He's a good person.
People like Charles.
You know.
Some people like me and some don't.
I'm a very quiet, well-behaved citizen.
- I've gone from one extreme to another.
- You've gone in a complete circle.
You used to make trouble on the streets.
One of the last times I went out with you, we were walking around... and you went up to some old lady on the street... and started drilling her about her spiritual life... and she got frightened and threatened to call the police.
Charles goes up to these strangers on the streets, starts raving at them.
He was just a kid having fun.
- This was when he was about 30.
- No, he wasn't!
He's still doing that kind of stuff.
Now he doesn't leave the house.
He got in trouble whenever he went out.
Will you give me one good reason for leaving the house?
At least he's not out taking illegal drugs.
- No, he's taking legal drugs.
- I'm taking legal dope.
Or being married and making some woman miserable.
This is true.
One thing that kind of...
I spent all this money.
And he's got these $200 teeth upstairs and he won't wear them.
- They're too uncomfortable.
- At first.
You gotta leave them in there.
Then you don't know they're there.
I never go anywhere, see anybody.
What does he need them for?
To chew food or what?
Pride in his own appearance.
He never goes out.
What does he care what he looks like?
I take a bath about once in six weeks.
I believe in having a certain pride in yourself.
In a way not that your ego gets out of hand and you're an egomaniac...
Pride can't exist except in relation to other people.
Yeah. That's right.
I don't know. Your hygiene habits are pretty good.
I'm never constipated.
That's about all I can say for myself.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, we still do it.
We also mark our faces and skin.
We paint everything... the jaguar, the fish.
Only after five days....
First we put paint... then charcoal.
It lasts five days.
About four or five days old.
Yes, I did.
Kuberene... and Iroa.
Yes, we played.
I don't remember, it was too long ago.
Kuberene was kind of a sad boy, but a good person.
The other boy was more cheerful... enjoyed playing.
One was more joyful, the other sad.
Yes, they had families.
The aruanas were immortal fishes that lived in hidden lakes inside the earth.
One day, though, Hariua, a smart young aruana... found a shaft of sunlight.
Immediately he remembered the wise advise of Kobehi, the oldest shaman:
''Avoid the shaft of sunlight that comes through a long, narrow, stony path.''
''It leads to suffering, pain, danger and death!''
But a strong feeling of curiosity took the young aruana closer....
We don't have... any written education... we get our knowledge from our parents and families.
They teach us about our destiny, about being an Indian... being a human being, and about life.
If we don't respect our elders... we'll be lost.
We really have to fight to try to maintain the maximum possible... of our culture, our language, our dances.
During the years of colonialism... the whites wanted us to be their slaves.
During the republic they tried... to change us into whites overnight.
They put the hospital here, the hotel, the school... the machines.
We were confused... not knowing how to live in this new situation... and after the years... of white man's civilization... we have to defend ourselves. But how?
By learning something from the whites, in the school.
Yesterday, an Indian... was wounded deep in his back.
He was in great pain.
We'll see if we will have to operate.
I'm seeing an airplane.
It's coming down from the sky.
We teach our children to read.
First in our language, Karaja, then in Portuguese.
Two languages at the same time.
We want to learn only the good things from the whites.
We don't want to live in the town... because there we would learn only... the bad things the whites are doing.
That's why we teach our children, so that won't happen.
Yes.
I liked it very much, I was very happy.
It touched me.
My feelings...
I have missed him a lot since I lost him.
And now, when I saw him...
I was very happy indeed.
I've been feeling so sad... and this was great for me.
It was great to see him alive.
I wish I could still see him.
When I saw him moving...
I felt he was alive again.
My father was killed... when a crocodile attacked him.
It was down at the lake.
He was fishing... with two friends.
He was steering the canoe.
The water was very low.
When the canoe passed over a crocodile... it went crazy and attacked my father... right at his neck.
Yes.
In this village... a lot of things have changed since your last visit.
But for me the saddest thing is that I've lost my husband.
I feel very lonely...
I miss the safety he gave me.
I remember long ago, one night he came into my hut... and the next morning we were husband and wife.
And so he stayed with me.
He was a very good person, very kind and hard working.
And welcome to the 38th annual NBA All-Star game... from Chicago Stadium.
A standing-room-only crowd.
A steal by Jordan. he spun it away from the Mailman.
Just needs a little time-out to reorganize.
And the chances of a West comeback are slipping away.
Aguirre for three.
I have never seen an All-Star game... that had such spectacular passing... and plays, and thundering plays like this.
They're beginning to hang, Billy.
Ah, what a way to end this ball game.
Right now, I wanna, you know, play in the NBA... like anybody else would wanna be.
That's who -
That's something...
I dream and think about all the time - playing in the NBA. he's just doing something that he loves so much. he just love it so much.
I'm just happy for him.
If somebody can understand the way William play... that'll make me feel a lot better.
The way they should have understood the way I played.
This Chicagoan is making his seventh All-Star appearance.
From the Detroit Pistons, 6'1 "...
Isiah Thomas!
When I get in the NBA... the first thing I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna see my mama, buy her a house...
I'm gonna go there and make sure my sister and my brother's okay.
If we were okay or not.
Probably get my dad... a Cadillac Oldsmobile... so he can cruise in the games.
Something real long.
Dominique.! Ooh.! he dreams about it. he look at those basketball commercials... where they be advertising these Nike shoes? he'll tell his little, small brother...
"Joe,Joe, that's me. "
So the West leads.
Thomas trying to go the distance. Loses it.
I don't even think about it, if he don't make it.
Just 'cause I'm so -
I'm so, you know, focused in on him making it.
I just know he'll make it.
I'm off to Central... and the Congress
Expressway- a park over there where there are some pretty talented young men.
Earl Smith works downtown as an insurance executive.
On weekends he's an unofficial talent scout for several area high schools.
This is what you call
"beating the bushes. "
This is the job of most of your freshmen coaches... and guys like me who - who played a little bit of the game... who love trying to help young people on the road to success.
It's in! It's in!
Today Earl spots Arthur Agee, whojust graduated from grammar school. he's got the quickest first step that I've seen in about five years. his first step.
I will bet you a steak dinner in four years you'll be hearing from him.
I don't even know anything about him.
Several days later,
Earl takes Arthur and his family on a recruiting visit... to the high school where NBA star Isiah Thomas played.
The visit will give
St. Joseph's coaches... a chance to see Arthur perform.
Your role today, Arthur... is to impress the coaches.
Try not to be too fancy.
Take the open shot when you have it.
Play good defense and make good passes.
The rest of it, just play natural,you know.
I'm hoping I'm gonna go to St. Joe and play... but first I gotta -
I gotta get my books straight.
And... hopefully come out and impress the coaches.
Is it kinda scary?
Yes, it is.
I've never been to a school way out before... and I would be going to a school with different kids, different races.
You can look at the scenery, new friends to meet.
What if Isiah's there today?
Well, if he be there...
I'll be shocked...
'cause that'd be my first time ever seeing him... up close, you know, real life.
Basketball has to be second to your academics.
If you don't get your grades, you're not gonna play.
If you work hard at the grades, and if you work hard at basketball... then I would be able to help you as far as going to college.
And I guarantee this.
I can't promise you where you're gonna go and if you're gonna be a star... but I guarantee that I would help you get into the school... that would be best for you.
I'm making a commitment to you... if you make a commitment to being part of this kind of a program.
Out of all of the kids at the St. Joseph Basketball Camp... there are a few like Arthur that Coach Pingatore is recruiting.
It was like million of guys trying to be better than the other... but, to me,
I was better than all of them... except Isiah.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you a graduate of St. Joe's... high school all-American... all-American from Indiana University... five-time NBAAll-Star...
Isiah Thomas. hello. how are you?
In everybody's neighborhood, there's a guy who can really play. he can shoot the lights out.
Every time down the court -
Swish, swish, swish!
Then he goes to St. Joseph high School... and the guy gets cut.
You say, "But Tom was real good.
Why did he get cut?'"
See, Tom didn't learn the fundamentals of team basketball... which is what you're learning how to play. he told my daddy that he knew I could play... so hejust had to play me hard.
I can see the playground in him.
I can see talent.
But I don't see the confidence.
With Isiah, I just knew he was gonna be a great one. he had that total combination of personality, confidence, talent... intelligence.
I think I see it in one kid that's coming here. he flows with a smoothness and confidence... and strength... that you don't see in every kid.
But he could become a great player.
You gotta take a shot.
Always work it. You can't block it.
Ohh.!
I just bang him and bruise him.
I'm trying to let him know right now you gonna get hit, get knocked down... you gonna get banged around, so you better get used to it now.
Stop it. One-hand hook.
All these basketball dreams I had, they gone.
All I see -All my dreams in him now.
I want him to make it so bad,
I don't know what to do.
They want to play basketball and stuff, that was always okay.
But I was gonna make sure all of'em got through high school.
A high school diploma was very important to me.
My mother, she was like mother and father to me.
She don't want me really hanging around over here that much...
'cause of the gangs.
I feel if I go to St. Joseph...
I'll at least get a good chance to go to a good college.
That would be good for me.
That was my first son.
I said, "That's Daddy's man, '" so wejust started calling him "Man. '"
Get around it!
I could have been a good college player.
Most likely
I would have made it to the pros.
But, you know, once I had my son...
I knew then something good was gonna come out of it.
I think the talent gonna be passed on. he told me, "I'm so scared of growing up. "
I said, "Why?" he said a grown-up has so many problems.
"I got so many things on my mind. "
I just want Arthur to have more... you know, have a better life than what I had.
I don't want him experiencing bad things that I went through in life.
Austin Boulevard will be the next stop. Austin is next.
Like Isiah Thomas before them... both Arthur and William make a three-hour round trip each day... between the city and St. Joseph's.
That was strange for me going out to a far-out school.
I saw a rug, flowers, clean hallways... things that I didn't see in an ordinary school.
Gotta move! Gotta move!
Come on.
- Three, four, five or 10?
- Ten.
You got it. Three, four, five?
Arthur wins the starting point-guard position on the freshmen team.
Agee, I want you to find in that warm-up number two.
Brown, number three.
Ettmeyer, four. hey, Arthur, you know if you miss free throws... they count 'em up, and you have to pay 15 cents.
Then if you don't pay it, they gonna make you run 50 laps, and still you have to pay the money.
- You still gotta pay the money?
- That's way out.
When Arthur first started at St. Joseph's... he was a good kid, from what we saw... but he was very immature. he might have been a little more disruptive, speaking out... getting into childish things. he wasn't used to the discipline and the control. he reverted back to, maybe, his environment, where he came from.
I just never been around a lot of white people and... it was different, because at a black school
I could associate with the people.
They talk the way I talk.
It was a little hard, but I can adjust to it.
You can see there was talent there.
We kept saying up in the stands,
"Get the ball to Arthur... because he's going to do it for you. '"
And sure enough, they gave him the ball with seconds on the clock.
I noticed a change immediately after he started going out there.
To see your child mature, you say,
"Oh, maybe this is good for him. "
William begins his freshman season on St. Joe's varsity... the top-ranked squad in the state. he's already received several letters... from Division I schools -
Marquette and Rice and Creighton,
Illinois State... to name a few.
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!
Keep back! hold it up! hold it up!
You're killing us!
Why did he get to the ball before you? he asks me, do I wanna be a great player? And I keep saying yeah. he said, "For four years,
I'm gonna be on you every day. "
So he said, "You might as well get used to it now. " hard left. No, no. Go hard left.
Right, I know you can do it.
Left, you can't. All right? Go hard.
Not bad. Do it again.
If you look at Matthew, and again he's saying... at the time the kingdom ofheaven will be like this.
This is how Matthew's gonna useJesus.
This is how he's gonna start it out.
What this is saying is you have to take the faith-
When I first came out here, it was, like, "I wanna go home.
Is this really the right school for me?'"
But every little thing you do that go against their rule... you have detention.
And they'll suspend you quick at the school too.
They'll suspend you quick.
The kids that are willing to do it... are gonna take something away that will help them for the rest of their life.
The kids that are not willing to do it... for whatever reason, uh... are not gonna be very successful as far as here.
The civil rights movement started up in the '50s.
When William first entered St. Joe's... tests revealed he was working on a fourth or fifth-grade level.
I could see that he had the potential... but because he was shy, it seemed as though no one was trying to reach him.
Sister Marilyn told me,
"You have to be one good ballplayer... to get in this school with these grades. '"
- What war beginning in the '60s?
- Vietnam.
At the end of the year, he had gone four grades above... just in the way he listened and learned.
Back in grammar school... academics really didn't matter too much to me at all.
It was playing ball for the team- really, we was the standouts in the school.
If you showed up in class, that was good enough for them.
I was just going to school for the girls.
Trip out with your friends... get out, go play some more basketball.
That was basically it.
Arthur also entered St. Joe's on a fourth or fifth-grade level.
Nobody in their right mind is crazy about school.
If the president brought up a thing right now that say, "Close all schools"... do you think any kids would be trying to go out there, stand on a picket line... and wave and get billboards... saying, "Reopen schools"?
Nice and tall, guys.
Now, don't look at the flash.
Arthur was in the lower group of the general program.
Okay, fellas. Good.
At the end of the year, he was still in the lower group.
One, two, three.!
For Arthur, the season is over. his freshman team finished second in the conference.
William's varsity is rolling through the play-offs.
Against Proviso East,
William plays his best game yet.
And the Chargers move a step closer to going downstate to compete for the title.
St. Joe's made it downstate five of the last six years.
The one thing we haven't done is win a state tournament.
Man, that'd be a big thing if I could go downstate as a freshman.
Isiah was good enough to start on the varsity as a freshman.
I didn't do it because I was worried about bringing him along too rapidly.
I think by not doing it, it cost us a state championship.
In the sectional finals,
Fenwick challenges St. Joe's title hopes.
But in the second quarter,
William steps up.
With his brother Curtis looking on...
William scores 16 points to lead the Chargers to the sectional title.
From Chicago, it's The Sports Writers On TV.
I think I may have seen the next Isiah Thomas.
St. Joe of Westchester has a kid named William Gates... who is starting as a freshman.
Remember, you heard it first from Bill Gleason.
Put it in your memory banks, ladies and gentlemen.
William Gates.
In the supersectionals,
St. Joe's meets DeSalles... to decide who will go downstate.
William plays more like an intimidated freshman than a freshman sensation.
Six-nine senior all-American
Eric Anderson dominates St. Joe's.
But in the third quarter,
William takes over again. he fires over Anderson and is fouled.
William's 13 points in the second half... pull the Chargers to within four.
With less than two minutes to play, it's a must-score.
St. Joe's jump shot falls short.
Eric Anderson.!
Despite the loss,
William's gutty performance... bodes well for next year.
There will be an announcement on ticket sales immediately following the game.
Rewriting 7,300 times 10... to the negative fifth in scientific notation.
Who wants that problem?
- I do.
- Go ahead, William.
- times 10 to the third.
- times 10 to the third times-
- 10 to the negative second.
- Is that good!
Very good.
When I went out there,
I was very intimidated...
'cause I just knew that everybody out there was just smarter than me.
As the year went on... and I was making an "A'"and "B'"honor roll...
I just felt like,
"hey, I'm just as good as them. '"
Now what you have to identify-
Both William and Arthur have partial scholarships from St. Joe's.
The rest of William's tuition is paid for by Cycle... a Cabrini Green organization.
But Cycle can't cover this year's tuition increase.
I was called on by Brother Edwin Duprais. he was trying to raise money to help kids... that couldn't otherwise go to those kind of schools.
It really touched a soft spot in my heart... and so I decided that my husband and I would participate on a personal basis.
William was selected as the kid... that was able to go to school, based on our contribution.
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
You played a great game. I want you to meet our friends Liz Duncan, Tom Paris.
- Nice game.
- William Gates.
With continuing support from Patricia Wier...
William is assured that his entire education at St. Joe's... will be free.
Arthur's family is paying for half ofhis tuition... and the increase comes at an especially bad time.
Worked for Sara Lee, got laid off.
Uh, worked for Scala's Meat Packing.
Got laid off there. You know.
You look around your house, you see your food getting low. Okay?
And you got your bills due here, your bills due there.
I got called down to the office.
Brother Leo wanted to talk to me. he was telling me about how much, certain money my mama had to pay... for me to stay in school.
They say if she don't have it by this time, you gotta stay out till she pay it.
I was staying out, like, two and three weeks and stuff.
By the end of the freshman year... whatever balance there was for tuition was never taken care of.
Consequently, going into the sophomore year... we had the balance plus the new tuition... so that it was going to continue to become a problem.
Whatever scout that they have come out to these different neighborhoods... and scout out these little basketball players... and get 'em to come to their school and offer them these scholarships.
Then once they get out there, the story is totally different.
I was under the impression that Arthur would have help as far as getting to school...
Arthur would have help in getting his books.
But, see, none of that occur.
Finally, with the Agees owing $ 1,500 in back payments...
St. Joseph's forced Arthur to leave the school.
I thought Pingatore and them would help me out, but -
You have to draw the line because, as I said... tuition is something that, as a school, we depend on... for 90%% of our revenue.
I guess he thought I wasn't gonna be that big of a ballplayer.
So why would he just waste some money on me staying there?
Or, you know, he thought
I wasn't gonna grow. he kept on saying,
"When are you gonna grow?"
Well, I don't know.
If I had known that all of this was gonna lead to this...
Arthur would have never went to St. Joseph's.
I mean, if I had known that he was gonna have to go through this type of pain... and myself- the anguish of it... and then to put him out in the middle of a school year-
I.D. 's, ladies and gentlemen.
All right. Okay, okay. All right.
Can't take no beepers in here.
Give me my beeper, man.
Mr. Wade, I need to see you at the front door.
Now where you gonna go?
Your friend go to jail. No beepers in here.
Don't make no scene.
Arthur is accepted at the public high school near his home. he's been out of school for two months and lost a whole semester's credit. here you have a youngster caught in the middle of two separate school systems. had he stayed at St. Joseph's... he would have been able to receive credit for that first semester.
Doesn't seem fair, but then that's the system.
If he was going out there and he was playing like they had predicted him to play... he wouldn't be at Marshall.
Economics wouldn't have had anything to do with him not being at St. Joe's.
Somebody would have made some kind of arrangement, and the kid would've still been there. he's not making it like they thought he was gonna make it on the basketball court... so he's not there, simple as that.
It doesn't take no brilliant person to figure that out.
It's mid-season when Arthurjoins the sophomore team. he was so depressed and devastated, hejust closed himself off in the room.
I would go in there and tell him every day, "hey, things will look up. '"
Coming off the bench,
Arthur wears number 11...
Isiah Thomas's number.
What kind of techniques were being used... to take away the freedoms that had been earned?
- Jeannetta.
- Poll tax.
Poll tax. Okay, Arthur, what other techniques were used... to keep black Americans from voting?
Um-
You could almost forget about his being there.
That's how quiet he really was.
I think the transition had something to do with it.
In comparing
Marshall high School to St. Joseph...
I don't think that there is any comparison.
People can afford to send their children there.
They can afford to put money into the school.
Once they walk in those doors... they walk in there to get that diploma and to go on to college.
Whereas our students, if they get out ofhigh school... a lot of them, it's an accomplishment.
Trinomial. What's this gonna be?
Both of these are what?
Ifhe wanna go back next year... he gonna go back, if I have to beg.
Because, uh, I wanna help him with his little dream.
Arthur's mother, Sheila, has lost her minimum-wagejob... as a nurse's assistant... because of chronic back pain.
It's just a real hard area to live in, period.
And as far as raising kids - kids don't even have a playground or play area... anything constructive to do in the neighborhood.
But you see why half of them become gangbangers, you know.
Because it's nothing constructive in the neighborhood for 'em.
So now it's, like, you more or less got to keep your kids close to you... and watch 'em at all times.
In June, after 20 years of marriage...
Arthur's dad leaves the family.
Big logjam into the lane.
Jordan's 15-footer good from out front.
Make sure you look at how many shots have been taken.
Jordan might shoot, uh, 15 out of 40.
Fifteen out of 40?
I'm just saying, for instance. he's done it.
But see, if you do that, you're gonna know about it.
Ooh.
Curtis tells William,
"The most important thing... is getting the ball in the basket. '"
Curtis said the boy's good. he say he's real good, but he don't listen. he said if he listen to him, he'd be better. he's always telling me, you should do this and you should do that.
Seems like everybody I know is my coach.
I know a whole lot about basketball.
Now it's Isiah Thomas.
I guess, in so many words,
I'm a pro at that in my mind.
The Trojans were led on the court all season by 6'2'"sophomore guard...
Curtis Gates.
When he went to college, and Michael Jordan first came to the NBA... they would,you know, sit around and argue over him- who could play the best.
Curtis was named Player of the Decade at ColbyJunior College... but he also developed a reputation for being uncoachable.
Curtis's idea of being real good is... you don't follow the rules, you do what you wanna do.
Curtis finally signed at the University of Central Florida... but he didn't get along with the coach and rarely played.
Even ifhe didn't play ball... it was a nice university. he could have finished school.
But he couldn't handle it.
Security. Can I help you?
I'm used to everybody in the neighborhood loving me... and knowing how good I can play.
It just seemed like people looked up to Curtis Gates when it came to basketball... but now...
I'm just a regular old guy on the street now.
Welcome to the prep game of the week... in the Class AA Sectional Final.
You got the guru, the legend, in Gene Pingatore.
Gates.! Good.!
Boy, Gates is on fire.
William Gates is one of the premier sophomores.
William scores
17 points in the first half... as the Chargers look to return to the state finals.
Gates.
Good.! he is a thoroughbred of a player.
Can they get it done here now?
In the second half, Gordon Tech turns to their own sophomore star.
Kleinschmidt drives the middle, puts it up. Good.!
Gordon Tech hangs on to a slender lead in the waning seconds of the game.
Three-point lead with 12 seconds left.
My guy's William Gates.
I'd like to see him get it,just get to go one-on-one and pull up and ice it.
Oh, boy. This is it.
- Gates is the man with the ball.
- That's the one I would want. he's gonna pull up from way out.
Off the front of the rim.!
Kleinschmidt hits it around.
Three seconds left.
Cunningham goes out. It's up.!
No good.! Gordon Tech wins.!
Congratulations to the Gordon Tech Rams.
They're on a joyride, one game now from Champaign.
Come on.
Arthur's season ended well, and he has high hopes... to play for the varsity next year.
Whoo! Lots of iron on that shit.
Arthur's dad shows up.
Man got big hands.
These days, Arthur rarely sees him.
- Watch this. Watch this dunk.
- Joe, I'm gonna go after you, okay?
Watch this.
You got old legs, Dad.
Old legs. hey, man.
I'll see you later on, okay?
Bye.
Increasingly, this playground court... has become a place to buy and sell drugs.
"Dear Mother...
"I hope when Mother's Day comes...
"you will light up the sky with a big smile.
"You, Mother, are the only one in the world...
"who can provide and take care of me.
"You are the one that makes our family work.
"You are the one that I will miss so much when I go away to college.
"No one can replace you ever.
Love always, Man. "
Mother's Day, 1989.
I said to him,
"What are you gonna do this summer?'" he said, well, he didn't know.
So I said, "Well, if you need a job... let me know, and I'll see if I can help you. "
We had a job that didn't require a lot of previous training... so we hired him.
I messed up so bad on my first day
'cause I wanted to do everything right.
Just messed up everything.
Puttin' tapes in the wrong numbers... all sorts of stuff.
But I just pushed myself to come out here... because I know, in the long run, it's gonna be good for myself... and for my family.
I give my mother $50 out of my checks.
All she done for me, I don't think there ever be enough that I can get to pay her back.
Unless I make pro.
Then I'm pretty sure I can pay her back.
I drew on these.
Look at my name.
Tuss.
I had heard that his nickname used to be
Tuss, so I just started calling myself Tuss.
Say "Tuss. '"
You know, I say,
"Man,you may not make it to the NBA. '" he said, "Don't keep on telling me things like that.
That's just like showing me you don't have any trust in what I do. "
I said, "I do, but don't just keep putting everything into this. " he said, "Ain't nobody gonna take my dream away from me.
That's what I wanna be, and that's what I'm gonna do. "
Go first.
I say, "hey, it's your dream.
What can we do?'"
Yeah!
"Dear William, Georgetown University basketball staff is very interested in you. '"
"We are going to kick off the season with a midnight madness celebration. "
Bobby Knight called.
Michigan State - boy, do they ever call.
"Will be on national television. "
Any school you name.
"Dear William, there's gold at the end of the rainbow.
$500 in there for you too. "
Did you see Isiah play the other night?
Yeah, I caught the end of it.
- how'd you like it?
- he played pretty good.
The whole school see me as being a Isiah Thomas.
I'm trying to build my own identity.
When I leave, they're gonna be, like,
"You're gonna be the next William Gates. '"
The St. Joseph Chargers are strictly man-to-man.
- Gene Pingatore believes in that system.
- Watch Isiah come.
- Going down the middle, throws it up.
- What did he do?
- he took the charge.
- he took the charge.
- Something we have to get you to do, right?
- Yeah.
Everything he does is what a coach is looking for.
You listening?
Out to Clark.
This is Thomas with the ball again.
What an eye.!
You're actually a better shooter than Isiah from the outside.
True.
That's heads-up ba -
Oh! Thomas! What a move.
That means you have a lot of responsibility, William.
Can you handle it?
I hope so.
I'm ready to go downstate.
- You wanna go downstate?
- Yeah.
You gotta do something about it.
You have two years to get us down there.
It's going to be all on your head.
Isiah Thomas has just hit his 20th point.
Go.! hold up.! William.
The man playing defense dropped way offhere.
Now, who would you rather have shoot the ball?
Stras shoot the ball there, or you stop in here and shootin' the ball?
- Me.
- Well, shoot it!
William practices today having just recovered from a slight knee injury.
Come on. Let's go.
You're playing soft.
William? Does it bother you?
Don't be afraid though.
Don't favor it.
Tempo.! Tempo.! hold it. That's bullshit!
You didn't jump to the ball and deny the man!
Go!
That's still one.
Nope. It's still one.
We'll stay here all day until you get a 10-seconder.
William, you gotta take it easy.
Go!
Go!
Go.
Now we start all over.
You peoplejust refuse to work.
You don't know what it is to be intense!
And if you don't have it, you're gonna be crap for this team.!
Give me a good reason why I should keep you on this team, Corey. how 'bout you, Reed?
Give me a good reason.
What do you think, William?
I mean, how many of these people work hard?
- Not too many.
- Not too many.
Wanna stay home when the state tournament comes?
All right. Go on in.
The next day in practice,
William reinjures his knee.
You, most likely, have at least torn this cartilage... the inside cartilage of your knee.
And you may have a ligament tear in your knee, okay?
If the ligament is torn, William, you would miss this year... entirely.
This is a lot to happen to you at an early age. A lot.
I think, if all goes well... you'll be able to come back.
Everything was just going great.
Now this.
All you guys can't get large.
- Somebody accidentally-
- What's up, man?
Somebody gotta wear medium.
You little skinny guys wanna get in a large.
What the other guys gonna put on?
Watch that boy. he'll steal your drawers.
Junior year, Arthur makes varsity for the Marshall Commandos.
This is the year, right?
This is it.
All righty.
Not too bad.
Fine.
Back home, the family's troubles have worsened.
Now I'm on welfare... that I wasn't on then.
And trying to live month-to-month on something like that is very hard.
You have three growing kids that need this... and you have bills to pay... and it's just not enough to make ends meet.
Man.! Sweetie, is Man in there?
I was never raised on welfare.
My mother and father both worked.
We was cut off for three months.
We was cut off aid complete with no income.
So, therefore, do you know what happened?
Our lights were cut off.
Our gas was cut off.
And we were sittin' in the dark.
They had cut me offbecause
I failed to meet an appointment.
It hurt everybody.
It changed everybody's attitude.
That you can have something today and it's gone tomorrow.
So you know what the system is saying to me?
Do you know what it's saying to a lot of womens in my predicament?
They don't care.
The good news is that your ligament looks fine.
- Good.
- Okay? Your ligament looks fine.
We can actually sew the cartilage back.
So you're looking at a minimum of 12 weeks, maybe 16 weeks... before I'll let you play ball again.
Possibly being able to play by tournament time.
Okay?
I'm gonna slip you a little something into the I.V... to kind of take the edge off of things, okay?
All right?
- I can tell.
- Yeah.
No doubt.
- Let's turn him.
- Yeah, this way.
If it stays there.
Probably go with the right post here and little stuff.
The doctor told me he wasn't gonna even try to get him ready to play this year.
So what do you think that gon' do to his career?
I really thought Curtis was gonna make it.
But he didn't make it, so I just wanted to try-
I just wanted this one to make it.
We were able to repair the cartilage.
Okay?
When basketball is over,
William may not have a friend in the world.
Curtis lost his job as a security guard... and has been unemployed for over four months.
Sometimes I sit around and my eyes just kinda get watery...
'cause I be, like,
I ain't amounted to nothing.
You know, I ain't got nothing.
I can't even go out there and get a job making seven dollars an hour.
I'll be sitting there telling myself,
"You ain't gonna get no better. '"
What did y'all tell me about after y'all go to college and everything... y'all get your own place?
We can all go to Arby's, baby.!
- And get fresh Matt's Cookies.
- And going toJewel's for our meat.
- That's a lot of food stamps.
- We ain't gonna need no food stamps.
Each day is a struggle.
Trying to deal with the kids'attitudes as well as my own... and trying to be strong enough for them and myself.
- That is so neat.
- I forgot to turn in my work.
That is what you call a neat paper.
Yeah, that's neat.
Don't you say that about my son.
My son got a brain.
Now, you cut that out.
- But he don't use it.
- See that brain there?
Now there are two new members of the Agee household.
Arthur's sister Tomika has a baby girl named Jazz.
And Arthur's best friend Shannon moved in to escape his own troubled home.
Shannon is like me. he understood me, and I understood him. he could sit back and talk to me
'cause I was his best friend. he trusted me, and I trust him.
It's been crazy, as far as his father and his mother's breakup. he'll come home, and Bo stealing and buying drugs... and beat on his mother and stuff.
You have to call the police or get an order of protection... for him to leave me alone.
My father was the same way.
I think about it all the time, when you come home, and they fightin'.
You know, that gets to a child's head.
They can't - Especially when you're living with your mother... and you young, and that's all you see all the time. he had to do something to keep his spirit up.
Ahh!
Why you -
Starting at guard, number 11, a junior, Arthur Agee.!
When I played basketball,
I knew what I wanted to do.
This is what I want,you know.
This is what I wanna do for the rest of my life.
Come on, win it, boy!
Get that ball.! he's way behind where I think he should be at this point.
I've had a few guys come to me from college -
"Ooh, I like that kid. he's quick, he's fast. "
But something's missing with Art.
Shannon was on the basketball team too. he was a little more raw than Arthur is.
I couldn't handle two guys like that... so I tried the lesser of the evils.
That was Arthur.
Marshall's won six and lost 14... their worst record in 20 years.
You just in a hurry to do nothing...
'cause that's exactly what you're doing - nothing.
After spending most of the game on the bench...
Arthur gets another chance.
Get that ball.! Work that ball, boy.!
Yes.! That's the way you do it.!
In the final minutes of a close game...
Arthur takes it strong to the hoop. he's called for charging and fouls out of the game.
- There's been some bad calls all day.
- Amen!
I'm telling you. Oh!
The daily regimen of rehabilitation... is not the only change in William's life.
Say "hey!"
- hey!
- Say "hey!"
I was just basically scared to tell people.
I was feelin'sick,you know... holding all this stuff inside of me.
I couldn't let it out.
When I did finally tell Coach, he was like, "When did this come about?'"
And I said...
"Oh... three, four months ago. " he was like,
"Three or four months ago?"
I was in the delivery room.
The nurses gave her to her... and she handed the baby to me, you know.
And I'll never forget how hard she was squeezing my hand.
Once we got her home
William offered his help and stuff... but it was almost like I didn't want it
'cause she was mine.
You know?
Instead of the two of us.
So then, after a while we -
I finally let him keep her.
And he earned his title.
You smell good.
Your numbers look real good.
I think you're two to three weeks away from being able to practice full.
- You know what I mean?
- Two or three weeks?
I know you wanted to waltz in here today and I'd tell you to go back to practice right now... but I don't want it to have to tear again.
I felt that this was the year for me.
I know we can make it downstate.
That's just a big dream I done had.
I look up on the scoreboard-
My name is not even on there anymore.
Where do I fit in with this team?
William takes a makeup exam in math... because he skipped the final. here's the cutoff point for passing.
And you ended up right there.
So you passed the final - barely.
When I stopped playing ball, all my grades just sunk.
I understand we, uh - we got the A.C.T. results.
Yeah.
Not as good as we, uh - we wanted, huh?
William scores a 15 on his first A.C. T. he needs to score an 18 to qualify for an athletic scholarship... to any four-year university.
I think what we have to do is get you set up with the Britannica course.
We'll have to talk to Mrs. Wier.
Okay?
Sometimes you have had the right answer and you changed it to the wrong answer.
Through Patricia Wier,
William's St. Joe's sponsor... the cost of the six-week class is waived.
If you're just outright guessing -
If a monkey took this test and you trained him to do just B's and C's... he probably would get more right than if he picked A's and D's.
You just don't know the feeling... not knowing if you gonna be able to play... just because of a test.
I mean, as soon as you don't tighten one screw, everything falls apart.
- El caballo.
- El caballo.
- La vaca.
- La vaca.
Arthur, ¿Tienes tu el libro?
¿Tienes tu el libro?
Mmm.
- What do I say?
- Okay, how do you say "yes"?
"Yoy. '"
- how do you say "yes" in Spanish?
- Sí.
Sí. Look up on the board. he's a pretty smart kid, but he does just enough to pass. hey, Shannon!
Most of them that have come through here... and had that type of attitude... usually end up in the streets talkin'about they used to play for Marshall... and if they'd gone to class they could've gone to any school they wanted to.
This is just somebody standing on the street corner talking... trying to find a job, then can't find a job, that kind of thing.
This is where he's headed, really.
- how's your knee?
- It's pretty good.
Easiest thing right now would be for you not to play and wait till next year.
What do you wanna do?
- Wait till next year?
- Right.
- No.
- You think you're ready?
My next year is now.
I've seen athletes who have come back from surgery... where they worried about the injury.
When this happens, they may never be the player they were.
William's first start is the final home game of the regular season.
William should have shot it. he gotta do that the whole game. he only do it when they leadin'.
It was like my injury was making him look bad.
Run it out.!
I always felt that Curtis... should not be living his dream through me.
If he don't do somethin' out here on this court -
Man, he ain't showed me nothin' yet.
You gotta come out and start playing hard all the time.
Otherwise you're just another player.
You follow me?
Just remember the way we talked.
Okay? As long as you're physically able.
If you're not, you shouldn't be playing at all.
So nervous about the start tonight.
But I'm glad it's over with.
Now I can just... get onto the floor more better.
Spread the floor to four corners!
St. Joe's has made it to the sectionals.
And in the final minutes...
William goes to the free throw line with the Chargers leading by six.
Always a clutch free-throw shooter... he sinks four straight to help seal the victory.
In the sectional finals...
St. Joe's looks for revenge against Gordon Tech... the team that knocked them out last year.
With his whole family watching...
William seems out of sync and bothered by his knee.
You are not working hard enough!
You understand me?
They want it harder than you!
At the beginning of the fourth quarter...
St. Joe's leads by a point.
Got any pain with that?
While the doctor examines William's knee...
Gordon Tech surges ahead.
The Chargers steal the ball, trailing by one.
William calls time-out.
I want it down floor so we can get it to one of our good jumpers.
With only seconds on the clock... the Chargers find William in the corner.
The shot doesn't fall, but William is fouled.
With six seconds to go...
William steps to the line with two free throws... and a chance to win. he shouldn't have been out there. he shouldn't have been playing.
- The knee?
- I'm very disappointed.
Y'all get that on tape 18 times.
Disappointed in the system. he shouldn't have been out there playing. his knee came out of place a couple of times, it looked like.
I mean, if winning's that important, we need to reevaluate the program.
That ain't no excuse. he got out there, said there wasn't nothin' wrong with him.
That's an excuse.
If he was hurt, he shouldn't have got out there.
There's two possible problems you could have.
You might have healed, say, 80% of that cartilage... and still have a small residual tear.
William's brother-in-law, Alvin... takes him to see Dr. hefferon, the Chicago Bulls team doctor.
What you need to do is have your knee arthroscoped again.
- What side we gonna do?
- Right side.
Right.
A lot of people say I shouldn't have played, shouldn't have came back at all.
Coach kept sayin' it's really up to me... and if you leave it up to me
I'm goin'back out there on the court.
We're gonna remove this portion of the cartilage here. he'll have a higher incidence of arthritis as he gets older than you or I would.
But in terms ofhis basketball career, he has a good chance of performing fine.
- There's the medial meniscus.
- Wow.
It's the only thing on my mind, is gettin' downstate... is makin' it down there.
I want to be able to go all out the whole year.
No setbacks, no nothin'.
At least Coach won't have to say,
"William, you didn't play hard this game"...
'cause when I step on that floor
I'm gon' be all business, and that's it.
One year after he left...
Arthur's dad Bo rejoins the family. he spent seven months in jail for burglary... and overcame an addiction to crack cocaine.
Man might fail ya, butJesus never fails.!
Praise God.! Whoo.!
If you haven't tried him, try him.!
Sometimes you look for friends and they're not there.
- ButJesus is always there.
- Amen.!
- Even in the midnight hour, he's there.
- Amen.
Glory to God.! Whoo.!
- hallelujah!
- hallelujah!
Glory to God.
Lord, we know you always bless the family.
Glory to God. Even in the beginning, Lord, you blessed that first family.
Glory to God. We pray right now, don't let nothin' come between 'em.
Send strength, Lord, glory to God, wherever there is weakness.
Please, Lord... let the love prevail.
- Yeah.!
- Thank you,Jesus.! Thank you, Lord.!
That's right.
While I was incarcerated...
I just asked God,
"Show me a different way.
Give me a new life. Take the taste of drugs and evil way of thinkin'away from me. '"
I asked the Lord to forgive me for what I did... the times that I mistreated my wife, beat her physically,you know.
I just hope this be a lesson to my children... to see me turn my life over to the Lord.
Oh,yeah.!
When I was little... he had let me down.
People used to come up to me -
"Your father a drug addict" and stuff.
And I'd just be, like, "Yeah, okay. "
You know?
And I used to take so much, you know... that he has to start realizin' that, you know - that what is he doing, you know.
'Cause I remember sometimes he used to try to go to church while he still - he was still on drugs while he was tryin' to go to church.
Give me a hug before you go.
- Give your granddad a hug.
- Thank you!
The closeness was not there at first, when I come back home.
And then Arthur, he was watchin'me-
What move would I make now?
Am I just... bein' like this since I just come back... or am I gonna break bad again?
William's dad invites him down to his auto repair shop. he hasn't lived with the family since William was a baby.
The car that I was gonna give you, uh, I didn't finish it up yet.
I got some more to do to it yet.
I didn't see him for, like, three years.
It never popped in my mind.
- The car back there?
- No, that's the car right over there.
That black Cutlass right there.
I think he's, like...
"Oh, he really must be able to play some basketball. '"
I think now he sees somethin'at the end for himself.
I remember one time he tried to whup me, but I wouldn't let him.
I said, "You may be my dad biologically, but as far as being there-
Enough. '"
You say you'd like to come to my next show that I do?
Yeah, come out and... finally get a chance to see you sing and -
Okay. What I'll have to do -
I don't have my schedules right this minute.
But I'll have to get that, and I'll let you know.
Alicia, you're my only friend.
"A'wight? Jimmi-fi. "
Thank you.
I always knew that I was gonna be a better dad than he was.
I wouldn'tjust leave her like that.
- Alicia?
- hmm? Yes, Mama?
If Alicia has a problem, then I have a problem.
She's believing whatever she said.
William's second rehabilitation... is at the Baxter Clinic... used by many of Chicago's pro athletes.
Both of William's operations and rehabs have been paid for by the school's insurance.
Don't expect to be playing in a game the first day back.
My mother put a big restriction on those pickups.
She said, "These are her knees now. "
When you're out on a date, do you have to have sex?
- No! No! No!
- Yes, you do!
No,you don't!
What about the woman's perspective?
All right, quiet down a minute here.!
For the second straight year,
Arthur and Shannon must take summer school.
- Restate your question.
- What'd I say?
Shut up!
This class is for freshmen, sophomores andjuniors... who have failed English.
The basic problem here... is that we were strapped for money... and we only had one English class available to our students. hopefully you could touch a nerve in some of them... like a spirited discussion on a controversial topic.
Because exactly what is having sex... but engaging in an act that doesn't fulfill -
Shannon really didn't care... so hejust stopped coming... and he was dropped from the roll.
Usually in an illicit-
Even if Arthur passes summer school... he may not graduate with his class next year... because St. Joseph's is refusing to release his transcripts.
I called up the school.
The lady explained to me that he owed $1,800... so I felt, well, they have a school policy there... and there's, uh, nothing
I can do about that.
About how much can you afford?
Okay, we're looking at 18-
- Oh.
Well, to total that out... and from here to -
June -When is graduation?
We're looking at somewhere around-
It's 181.30 per month.
Is there any way possible that his-
I don't know. I'm just asking.
- Sure.
- Could his credits be released too?
I will get a promissory agreement drawn up. Okay?
As long as you show me good faith after the first two months...
I'll release 'em, uh -
That would be end of September.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
- Then I'll send 'em to Marshall.
- Okay. That would be fine with us.
- I really appreciate this.
- how's Arthur doing, anyway?
Pretty good.
I can't really complain about him.
- Good.
- Wish he could've stayed here, though.
- Yeah. Me too.
- Well, things-
- Things happen, you know, and -
- Things happen,you know, and-
- hey-
- That's part oflife.
- I can't let him down no more.
- Good.
Okay, good.
I hope we can work something out then.
- I'd like to thank you.
- No problem.
- That's why we're here.
We try to help people.
- That's right.
- Okay? Very good.
- All right. Thank you very much.
- have a nice day.
- Take care now.
Okay. Very good.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- That's what I need.
- Yeah.
I think about it- had I not been on drugs when Arthur went to St. Joseph's... just how good it would have been for him. he wouldn't have had to leave. here's one of the corners right here where I used to come up and cop all the time.
Threw away a lot of money on these corners, boy.
I almost threw my life right along with it. he can just look at my life... and say here's a good example of what not to do.
If he had my ways...
I would be shakin' in my shoes right now. hey, look at that Georgetown coat.
Man, I might get that.
- Dang!
- Pocket on the side.
That's the one I was tellin' you about. how much?
Seventy bucks even, no tax.
Some of the drug pushers in the neighborhood... they'll give us money, tell us,
"Go shoppin; Go get you somethin; '"
They're thinkin; we playin'basketball and they can give us stuff... and keep our career goin;
So that's how we were to keep up with the styles.
A'ight.
While you're sitting here today... you should feel like a million dollars.
You should feel so special.
You are one of a hundred of the best high school players... in this country, the United States.
My mother, God bless her, she's in heaven today.
She used to always say to me, "This is America.
You can make something of your life. "
Come on! Come on!
Okay.
All the coaches from over here.
To the stands, please, coaches!
Coaches, we gotta clear!
If you a player, somebody up there gonna recognize that you a player.
So there's 250 of us here.
We're doing it to try to find out who the best players are and get 'em in our program.
There aren't very many kids at any level, including the NBA... that really understand what basketball is all about.
We always say, you're going to war, would you want him behind you covering your flank?
If you're pouting, they're gonna also recognize that.
And don't tell me they're not gonna write it down in that book.
At the prestigious Nike camp...
William hopes to prove the injuries are behind him... and he belongs among the nation's best.
One, two, three.
Next.!
One, two, three, four.!
Arthur and Shannon spend their summer at Pizza hut earning 3.35 an hour.
Yeah.
- hello. how are you all doing today?
- Fine.
It's a waste of my time down here.
I'm ready to go home. here I am, always tryin' to play this team ball.
A few coaches - more coaches comin' around to look... everybody feel they gotta do they own little thing here.
Move it.! Move it.!
Stick in the post.!
Some of you are gonna make it where you want to be... and others of you will not make it.
This is summer for them.
They don't wanna be sitting in a classroom.
But we provide them with an experience... you can't get anywhere else... in that we simulate what it's going to be like to be a student athlete.
Fifteen hours a week for basketball. how many hours do we have up here?
The statistics on Division I players graduating from college are really frightening.
Let's assume you're playing big-time college basketball... and your team travels-
You have to realize... that nobody cares about you.
You're black, you're a young male.
All you're supposed to do is deal drugs and mug women.
The only reason why you're here- you can make their team win.
If their team wins... these schools get a lot of money.
This whole thing is revolving around money.
Recruiting is like any other sales business.
We've gotta win to keep our jobs.
We've gotta fill the arena to keep our jobs.
And if we don't, they fire us.
I mean, that's - hey, if bankers don't make money, they fire them.
When you look at some of these young boys' bodies, they got NBA bodies already.
There's one particular kid who's here now...
I've watched him since sixth grade;
I've watched him blossom.
That's when you wanna get on 'em - when they're young - and start writin' 'em before everybody else writes 'em.
Try to get any edge you can in this business.
It's already become a meat market.
But I try to - to, uh, do my job... you know, and serve professional me.
What schools do you think are most involved with William right now?
I would say DePaul...
Marquette, Indiana, Michigan.
Excellent.
Great job! Way to go!
Bob Gibbons done seen me play my best game out here.
Turned in 16 points, 12 assists.
Bob Gibbons over there like this -
"hmm. "
Yeah, I was smilin' too, Bob.
Give me a slice of the crust.
Probably will.
Thanks a lot.
Look. hey, Mom.
Right now I'm feelin'good about myself.
I really feel like, since I been down here, that I was all-American.
When I go back home
I'm gonna feel unstoppable.
This one eyebrows up.
This one eyebrows up.
Swing it!
Whoo-hoo!
I'm gonna pull up on it, okay?
Tell me if it hurts more.
- Yeah.
- It hurts more when I do that?
Easy does it, now.
It's on the muscle.
It's not on the joint. It's above the joint.
Okay?
What's your name?
Though it's only a muscle injury... it's severe enough that
William will not compete for the final two days of the camp. how many electives you need to graduate?
- Six.
- Six?
Arthur's transcript from St. Joseph's has arrived.
If you pass all of the classes that you're presently taking... you can graduate from summer school.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- have you taken the A.C.T.?
- Mm-mmm.
When do you plan to take it?
Sometime soon.
What institution are you planning on going to? have you decided that?
I was, um, thinking about, going to, um... Alabama.
But you need to take
Algebra-Trig. Okay?
Do you plan to take that?
I don't know.
You don't know?
So you just barely gettin'by again.
No. You ain't gotta say that.
But you are.
You've been barely gettin'by all along.
Now, you gonna have to do better than that if you wanna go to Alabama... or any other school.
You gonna have to do more than just get by.
Don't forget to bring those papers back to me.
- Okay.
- All right.
St. Joe's just messed everything up.
Shouldn't have even went there.
Thought I had more credits than this.
They gon' kick me out
'cause I ain't payin' 'em money. Man!
That's all right, though.
I'm gonna still make it.
"Don't let your best opportunity get away from you.
"You can have a great experience at Marquette University.
"Once you visit our campus...
"I feel confident that you will know that Marquette is the right place for you.
Sincerely, Kevin O'Neill. "
I like these.
I been gettin; like, two a week from the school for... a couple of months.
So that's quite a few.
I know you're game, but, Monica,you seem very overwrought.
I had Division I offers.
I had even signed at Marquette
'cause they thought I was gonna make the grades.
The great ballplayers... they care about basketball more than they care about school... and I know they do.
Shaky. Shaky.
Ohh.!
Let me try somethin;!
If you're looking for a progressive college basketball program... with experienced leadership and a winning tradition... then the Marquette Warriors are for you.
William's first home recruiting visit.
Three top schools postpone visits... preferring to wait and see how William will do his senior year at St. Joe's.
If you don't make the test score, it doesn't mean we don't want you... because we still do- that's what I'm telling you.
If you tear your knee out again this year... and you can't play ever again... you're gonna have your education paid for at Marquette University.
I know that the scholarship is one-year renewable.
Gene's right about this, but any school worth its salt is gonna give you four years.
The bottom line is this- we want to win the national title.
Number two- I wanna make you the best player I can.
I wanna give you an opportunity to, maybe someday... be one of those guys that makes some money in Europe or in the NBA.
You're one of seven guys that we're recruiting right now.
- You're recruiting seven guys?
- Seven guys for three spots.
Where he fit in?
- Where does he fit in?
- Yeah.
As soon as William tells me he's not looking at any other schools... then I'm not looking at any other players.
So, what?
The first one sign, that's -
Well- Well, that's what it's gonna come down to.
If I tell you that, hey, you're our guy and this and that... and I lose you to Kansas, Indiana,
North Carolina State or something...
I'm out ofluck.
The president's saying to me,
"I thought you were recruiting a guard. '"
It's a tough situation, but it's something that has to be done.
It's a great place.
We're gettin'ready to have it rockin;
The best is yet to come.
Lot of serious ballplayers been through this building-
Junior Bridgeman, Sidney Moncrief,
Bob Lanier, Oscar Robertson.
Can you see yourself playing in this place here, 18,000 in it?
Big difference from St. Joe's, now.
We stayed at the hyatt.
Man, it was nice. Real nice.
They had these balloons all hangin' up on the ceiling, everything.
They-They really did it up.
And I must say, we did it up too.
We - Room service.
Man! had these phony newspapers written up.
Notre Dame 77, Marquette 76.
Gates is out high, calling for the ball.!
There are six seconds left.
The freshman spins past the defender, slicing to his left to the foul line.
Three seconds left.
Marquette down by one.
Gates launches a running one-hander.!
It's on the way.!
It is good.!
Gates buries a 13-footer just ahead of the horn... and Marquette has defeated Notre Dame.!
If you think we care about you a lot in recruiting... we're gonna do more when you're here.
Don't let it get to a point where somebody else comes in and takes a scholarship away.
Let us know what you wanna do- unless you know what you wanna do right now. he knows, but he won't say.
You talked to any, uh... leading black people on the campus?
- The leading black people?
- Yeah.
- Such as?
- Whoever might be in charge... of all the black students on campus - what kind of community life they have for the blacks there.
- Uh -
- Did you talk to anyone about it?
- Did you ask the players how they're treated?
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?
- Players say they treated fine.
I mean, they get the best of everything.
- You think that's where you wanna go?
- Yeah.
That's fine.
Obviously, if you wait you'll have all the other schools that were on you before... like Kansas and Indiana and North Carolina State.
That's all right, uh, but...
I discussed it with -
I think you should take a few days.
Because you just came back.
You understand?
- Poop!
- Yeah!
Yea!
Boo!
Is there any cash with this?
Uh, it's in the mail.
To four years of excellence.
- hear! hear!
- hear! hear!
- It's alcohol-free.
- It's not that bad.
I am fixing him a birthday dinner today.
It's his 18th birthday... and I want to show him how much we appreciate him and love him... and care for him.
Everything that you can imagine was going wrong with this family... but now everybody's together.
It's his favorite cake. he's a great kid.
And some kids don't live to get this age, you know.
That's another thing to be proud about - that, you know, it's his 18th birthday, he lived... and to get to see 18, that's good.
I wanna tell you that I love you very much.
I'm very proud of you.
It seems like I was 18 just yesterday. here. happy birthday. I love you.
- Ohh.!
- hey-hey.!
- happy birthday!
- I love you too.!
- Come over here.
- Where you goin', homes?
Where you goin', homes?
Blow out the candles.!
Two months after his 18th birthday...
Arthur is cut off public aid.
This is what I brought to their attention. he's still a full-time student. he hasn't graduated yet.
So why would you-all cut him off?
- I'll bite you!
- I'll bite you back.
They feel like when they get 18... most the black kids they drop out.
So that means that the child is just thrown out there.
I was gettin' 368.
Now I get 268.
And that's it.
And that's to take care of me from one month to the next.
Now, can you imagine a person living on that?
Do you-all wonder sometime, how am I livin'?
Or how do my children survive, or how they livin'?
It's enough to make people really wanna go out there and lash out and hurt somebody.
A message to the Oreo cookie.
No matter how much you wanna switch, here's what they think about you:
Fried chicken and biscuit-eatin'monkey, ape, baboon... big-thighed, fast-runnin; high-jumpin; spear-chuckin;..
360-degree basketball-dunkin;.. pit-swingin'spade moulanyan.
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Go the fuck back to Africa.
Think about it. Fuckin'sellout.
Play the music, motherfucker!
Put the music on!
Shoot it.
Rebound.! Go, go, go.!
Gates stinks.
You got that? he stinks. he doesn't play with confidence, like he did before he was injured.
I don't believe the other players have complete confidence in William.
They were in awe of William when he was a sophomore.
They're not in awe ofhim anymore.
Sophomore year...
I was just carefree.
If it could be done,
I was gonna do it.
I wish I could get that attitude back.
Go.! hold up.!
That's crap.!
That is dog-shit crap.!
Why did you have to do something unnecessarily?
If you would've kept it over here, William -
Look at me!
If you had kept it over here, wide, you could have gone all the way.
What is that crap, the shovel pass?
There was never any point in our school... where wejust- just played outright,you know.
Now, remember, think about the ball game on the way to the game.
I'll bet a nickel.
If I got a nickel.
Yeah, I got it!
Marshall began its season well... winning four of six.
Today's game will be their first against a city power.
The only way you gonna beat them is to play good basketball.
All that bullshit that you be playin' -
You play half of a game, for two or three minutes you play pretty good... then you go to sleep.
You have to play a whole ball game.
When we start out,
Arthur will be completely in the ball game.
But as the game progresses, then he digresses.
By halftime, Marshall trails highly favored Dunbar by 15 points.
But late in the fourth quarter...
Arthur and the Commandos claw their way back.
On a crucial possession... the ball goes to Arthur. hey, boy!
Gimme some, boy! hey, Arthur G! hey, Arthur G! You ever got rich, they'd catch you for sure! Come here, dog!
That's it, man.!
Showin'your beef!.
I want it up high, G.
I want it up high.
Led by William's 16 points a game... the Chargers have a 20 and 3 record.
But Coach Pingatore feels they're not ready for the impending play-offs.
Alabama.! Alabama.!
Alabama.!
Well, don't throw the ball!
Jesus, will you cut it out and quit acting like a baby!
Will you quit cryin'!
This team just drives me crazy.
It's been a struggle all year.
You think you're better than you are.
The two big guys are prima donnas.
They should be killin'people.
For you people that are really agonizing... andjust hate all this stuff and all the hollering... if you don't make a turn, it'll be over next week... so you won't have to worry about it.
That's the point.
I wanna end this game in the next three to four minutes.
Otherwise it's gonna be a ball game.
All right, let's go get 'em. Come on. hail Mary, full of grace.
Blessed art thou - holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
All right, let's go.
Come on.
William's just too nice of a kid.
I don't know ifhe has the killer temperament.
I don't know ifhe has the eye of the tiger. he's gonna need that when he goes to the next level.
Remember, square up!
It's business, it's big bucks... and that's what the scholarship's for.
Good job.
- his coach is stingy and selfish.
- My coach is not - he just want William to run out there and play-
- My coach is not stingy and selfish.
- Yes, he is!
The day she was gonna be born
I told him he had to be there.
I don't care what his coach say.
I know the game was important.
But this was more important, and his coach doesn't see it like that.
I just can't miss a game... just because, you know, an incident occur... unless it was like a death or somethin' like that.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Ain't like the girl was born every day.
That's what I was tryin' to get you to say.
Especially around that time of the year too - state tournament.
It was simply out of the question. he tells me,
"Well, it'll benefit us in the future. '"
I'm, like, "But what about now?" he keeps sayin' in the fu -
Basketball was my ticket out of the ghetto.
If I wouldn't have been playin'ball,
I would not even be goin'to college.
I'm goin' to college, and I have a daughter.
So what's my excuse?
- Because the situations are much different.
- No, it's not.
I haven't been workin'for about a year.
And if it wasn't for William knowing Miss Wier...
I wouldn't even be here.
'Cause I walked in the door and that's the first thing I see on the sign
- "No openings. "
It ain't much better than a person without a college degree can get.
So I feel like I'll be here for quite a while.
What you lookin' at?
I don't believe people when they be sayin; "Wow, school's hard.!'"
The work weren't hard for me.
All right. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
If I gotta do, like, a report or somethin;..
I don't like none of the topics, so I'll just pick somethin'that's simple.
So, what's the topic of your paper?
The life cycle of the butterfly.
- Gonna read it for us?
- Mm-mmm.
Aw, come on.!
No, man!
- I wanna hear it-
- I'm just doin' this stuff!.
I know, but I just wanna hear how you write.
"Well, as the people bloom into another year-"
You know, the year just changed,
January 1.
"The butterfly also blooms.
The butterfly are very beautiful flying objects. "
Then it say at the beginning of the butterfly, it goes through a change and all that.
Then I keep goin', man.
I just wanna, like, do that stuff.
Then I'll just keep goin' on and on and on... and I won't never stop.
Move out the way! Move!
Look out! Move out the way!
Its botanical name is Cannabis sativa.
Millions of Americans break the law and use it.
Arthur's latest report card shows... he's failing both Spanish and Science. he rushes through his work.
As you see, he just missed one assignment.
Mm-hmm.
But his test scores were pretty low.
- he had a 10 on one test.
- Mmm-mm-mmm.
Will you do me a favor?
When you see things are slippin' like this, give me a call and let me know.
Let me make sure I have the right phone number.
So I can stay up on top of this boy.
Because he tells you one thing -
I say, "Where your book?" "We didn't have to work on the book. It's in my locker. " he gonna have to start showin' me somethin' better. he probably on the borderline, and all that clownin', people just give him an "F."
That's what I would do too.
But I'm gon' stay up on his behind this time around.
'Cause I told him we payin' 181-odd dollars out there to St. Joseph's...
Right. for his transcripts. he got the transcripts and he ain't doin' that?
Uh-uh. It ain't gonna happen like that.
Man.!
You remember I told you, whatever I start I finish.
I'm not like some people I know.
I don't need nobody to push me.
All I gotta do is have the goal and the motivation, and I'm ready.
It's Sheila's graduation day... from a nurse's assistants class at a local community center.
A high grade will assure her certification.
I want to be an R.N. nurse.
I've always had that dream.
Well, Miss Agee.
- Sheila.
- hmm?
You scored 89 on the exam.
You're gonna get the highest grade point average for the class.
Really? Really?
No, no, no, no!
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you!
Oh, I'm so happy!
Oh, thank you, Miss Martin!
You did it yourself.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, you so good.
I didn't think I could do it.
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah, you did.
You gave me that belief in myself.
You're really inspiring me to go on.
Not just stop right here, but go farther.
And people told me
I wasn't gon' be anything.
The gym is packed for today's game against West Side rival, Westinghouse.
Marshall's rebounded from last year's dismal 9 and 16 record... to go 16 and six.
And Arthur has emerged as the Commandos' second-leading scorer and assist man.
Rebound.!
Somejunior colleges have begun to notice.
A lot of these kids won't talk to a junior college... really until after they've seen the dream of, you know...
Illinois and Nevada, Las Vegas and Georgetown kind of fade.
Ajunior college could be Arthur's only hope.
Without better grades and an 18 on the A.C. T... major colleges can't offer him a scholarship.
It's just too bad those kids don't realize... hey, if they had an 18, the door is so much wider open.
You're in the middle.!
In the fourth quarter, the Commandos fight back from an
11-point halftime deficit.
They trail by one.
We gotta play more aggressive on defense.
We're not good at playin' on defense.
Yeah, man.
Defense!
Derrick Zinneman's layup pushes Marshall to a one-point lead.
Moments later, a Westinghouse foul... and then a double technical puts Arthur on the line with a chance to ice the victory.
One more! Whoo!
The upset win is sweet vindication for the unranked Commandos.
- Arthur Agee, you lead the books.
- Junior!
You got seven.
Seven turnovers.
Even for the guards, that's too many.
This is a good win for you, but it doesn't mean anything.
You gotta do better than that, man.
You have to do better than that.
Yeah, man.
That was a good game though.
You could have played better though, you know.
Oh, Mom. You know he did good.
You'rejust killing me.
You know your mother's proud of you. he been gettin' down.
Like a real star.
Number 11...
Arthur Agee.!
Nearly four years after discovering Arthur on the playground...
Earl Smith shows up to see Arthur win his first play-off game.
I figured this game and the next game may be his last high school ball game.
- Where you been, man?
- Where I been?
- Yeah. Where you been?
- I've been workin'.
- Oh, yeah, right.
- I've been following you in the paper.
- Oh, yeah. You impressed or somethin'?
- Yeah. I'm impressed. I'm here, ain't I?
- If I wasn't, I wouldn't have followed you.
- You been talking to Ping?
- For what?
- You don't talk to him no more?
- Why not?
- What do I have to talk to him about?
- Well,Jamal -
- You ain't there.
- Yeah, you're right. I had to break out.
- Yeah.
So I was thinkin' about goin' tonight to see, uh, St. Joe and Nazareth play... but I wasn't sure if you had time to do it.
Yeah.
I've got a bitter taste in my mouth about a lot of things that happened.
A lot of people accuse me of taking youngsters... out of the inner city and taking them out to St. Joe high School... and they ask what did I get out of the deal and... a lot of racial slurs and so forth from my own people about me, about what I did.
I still felt and feel that I was doing the right thing... for that particular time.
Uh, sometimes I have second thoughts... when I see the net results of what happened with the youngsters.
Arthur.
- Arthur-
- Arthur Agee, sophomore.
My gosh. What are you doin'?
- What are you doin' now?
- Goin' to school.
- Where?
- Marshall.
Oh, I taught him.
Can you believe it?
- So you came in case you have to play St. Joe's?
- Yeah.
Arthur. Arthur.
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?
- What you been up to?
You playing basketball?
- What? Yeah.
- how'd you guys do?
- We did a'ight. Still playin;
Still playin'?
When's your next game?
- We gotta play Crane. high school in Chicago.
- That's cool.
It'll be all right.
William is benched for arriving late to the locker room... and Nazareth threatens.
William enters the game to go head-to-head with Nazareth star Sean Pearson... his friend and roommate from the Nike camp.
The favored Chargers race to an early 14-point lead... in this second-round play-off game.
Give me an "E"!
Give me an "R"!
But near the end of the game...
St. Joe's begins to unravel.
William takes control.
Pearson responds. his three-point shot gives the Roadrunners their first lead of the game.
For the Chargers, their whole season may come down to this possession.
Down by one, with just over a minute remaining.
A loss tonight would be their earliest exit from the play-offs in six years.
And for William, there is no next year... no more chances to get downstate.
It ain't but one thing: bad coaching.
Bad coaching.
Well, we got him here about five minutes late.
So what? This -This ain't no time to be teaching nobody no lesson.
All right, boy.
It's all right, bro.
- You all right? You're crying, man.
- Shut up.
Yeah.
- It hurt, don't it?
- Yeah. More than ever, man.
- I didn't never want to go out this way, man.
- Your last year, man.
I'm trying to get it, man.
I'm striving for the same thing. hey, man. We'll call you.
Give me a ring. All right?
- All right.
- You played a good game, boy. All right.
You're gonna be all right.
- I love you, boy.
- I love you too, man.
All right.
William was 20 minutes late.
The team was dressed and already talking.
Then he came strolling in.
Maybe he has to learn something from that.
Even in a big game.
The game was a mirror-
It was a mirror of all of the games all year.
To quote Isiah, the toughest loss he ever took was the-
My toughest. And that was the De La Salle game in 1979 when we got beat at the buzzer.
On a 30-footer. And we were favored to win the state that year.
Um, now we look back on it as just one of those great moments in - in our high school scene.
Our toughest loss to take, and we talk about it.
So that's what I look at, you know, with these things now.
- Arthur, we could have used you tonight.
- Yeah.
Good luck.
I'm gonna be watchin'. Don't forget.
Stay in touch.
- 'Cause we've talked about -You know.
- Yeah.
- School.
- Yeah.
All right. I'm watching you score. how's your grades?
- They're all right.
- Good.
- They're all right.
- We missed you.
- I missed y'all too.
- Well, I'm proud of what you've done.
Mr. Bedford said a lot of good things about you.
- You be in touch. Okay?
- Okay. All right.
- Good luck.
- All right. You too.
Marshall's second-round opponent,
Manley, presents little challenge.
This just explains a little bit about our program... where our program's headed.
I like what you're sayin; and I want him close to home.
- Yeah.
- You know. And, uh -
I think, you know -
I'm kind of leaning your way... because I just thank God that he's getting into it - you know, somebody do want him.
I'm Tommy Travis,
Northeastern Illinois assistant coach.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Arthur's father.
- Arthur hester.
- Okay. Arthur hester.
Us Arts gotta stick together.
- I'm over at Kennedy-King.
- Kennedy-King?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
May the best man win.
- I thought mom was a cheerleader.
- Oh, thanks.
Thank you for the compliment. his parents seem to think he may, uh, pass the A.C.T.
- he may what?
- he may pass it.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I hope he does.
- Us Arts gotta stick together, guy.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- hey.
Would you get excited if a college coach came up and talked to you?
Not really.
Really, it's just-
You'rejust going... to another level ofbasketball. That's all.
I'll be excited when I get there.
That's when you'll be excited the whole year.
I'll be excited as soon as I step up in there - first day of practice.
If I graduate, I think I'll be the only one in my family... besides my uncle, to finish college.
Me too.
In the fourth round against heavily favored Taft...
Marshall meets their first true test of the play-offs.
But the Commandos have been bucking the odds all year.
Arthur plays one ofhis best games of the season... scoring 19 points... and the Commandos claim a spot in the city semifinals.
The final four! I told y'all he was going all the way. All the way!
Do you guys feel you can play with any team in the city?
On any given day, we can play with anybody.
We can beat anybody.
Marshall now faces the ultimate test::
King high School, the rulers of the public league.
Winners oflast year's state crown, they were labeled the best team in the country.
King has sparked controversy by out-recruiting rivals... for the biggest and best grammar school players.
We don't understand what we're really doing to these young kids.
Kid not even 12 years old... and you're baiting him to come to your school... you know, to play basketball.
Falls back in the paint.
I'm not going to start recruiting in that manner.
No, I'll probably get out of the game before then.
The winner of these two semifinal games... will play for the Chicago Public high School Basketball Championship.
King's strategy is to go inside to its two seven-foot starters.
Only Arthur seems unintimidated by theJaguars.
And King's poor play keeps the game close.
We are the... best.!
We are the team!
I think they gonna take it.
But in the second half,
King makes their move.
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Get in the game.!
King grabs a four-point lead. hey, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie!
Y'all playing with no confidence whatsoever.
None!
None.!
- All right! Go get in charge of that ball!
- Don't foul him! Don't foul him!
Let's go! Let's go!
The Commandos get aggressive on defense...
Too soon now! and use their superior speed on offense.
Players, sit down.
We got three minutes to go. Sit down.
Marshall grabs a six-point lead late in the game.
We got a long time to play.
Coach Bedford wants to force King out of their zone defense... and make their big, slow players match up man-to-man against Marshall's quick guards.
One, two, three. Defense!
Arthur simply holds the ball as the clock ticks away.
The King coach has no choice.
For the defending national champions, it's all over.
And unranked Marshall will play for the city title.
Whoo! 26-2 now!
They're 26 and 2 now.
That's my Man!
All right, Man!
- I told you we could do it.
- Yes!
- I told you we could do it.
- I told you you were gonna do it.
I knew y'all was going all the way.
I told ya.
I said, "You're going all the way. "
This is your last year.
You're going all the way. Yeah.
They got the best shot ofhim,you know.
And it's great.
That was a great shot, wasn't it?
But this one in the, uh, Tribune is what I really like.
It says,
"Arthur Agee stood as still as a statue.
Time after time was on his side. "
You know, the championship that I missed when I was in high school-
Yeah.
Twenty-one years later I got a chance at getting a championship through him.
You know, you're always trying to build your children up... and saying, "Well, you-all can do it"... but, you know, really lying on the inside a little bit, saying...
"Well, you know, you got a long haul. "
But, you know, this make you even more confidence... because if he's sure of hisself, then you know you can bank on it.
Yesterday, you know, when he won the game, you know, he told me he loved me.
And, you know, I haven't heard that in, uh -You know.
You can feel it, but I haven't heard it coming verbally from him.
In a rematch with rival Westinghouse...
Marshall proves to everybody they have what it takes to be city champs.
Inside pass. Shot rejected.
To the lane with the layin.
Busts this game wide open.
Did you see that?
Did you see it? Did you see it?
They are celebrating because they know... their high school is headed to the elite eight in Champaign.
And the Marshall Commandos have won the Public League Championship... in convincing fashion-
58-38 winners over the Westinghouse Warriors.
What's up, man?
Told you on the phone what I was gonna do.
Told you, boy.
Marshall, baby. Marshall!
Marshall!
Marshall.! Marshall.!
Marshall.! Marshall.!
Your A.C.T. came in, William, and you received a 14 for a composite... which is not high enough.
Uh,you've taken the test-
Now, this was for the fourth time.
Now, if you add all those up, it comes out to 17.2.
In order to play at Marquette, you're gonna have to get the 18.
And they're very, very concerned.
One assistant called twice this week, and Bo Ellis called today.
Smile, William.
It's not the end of the world.
- Right?
- I hope not.
Well,you gotta work at this as hard as you worked at yourjump shot.
And it was missing a lot this year.
Okay.
Now you are down to the final inning and the last strike.
We're going, going downstate!
We're going downstate!
Now let's, let's celebrate!
Now let's celebrate!
- What are we gonna be?
- State champions.!
Your Marshall Commandos.!
- Yeah!
- We're gonna take state!
Take state! Number one!
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A.!
Beat B-A - B-A-T-A-V-I-A!
Downstate Marshall plays its familiar role as underdog... to third-ranked Batavia.
Justice has it. Justice, one-on-two.
- Spins up-
- Nice move.
In the media glare of a statewide audience, Marshall shows big-gamejitters.
Now bust out.
And Marshall missed the layup.
Sealed off,blocked by Williams.
You got easy shots.
You gotta make your easy shots.
I can't shoot for you.
Now he's gonna penetrate.
Left it for Christian. Missed the shot.
Luther Bedford looks like he's ready to commit suicide over there.
Y'all better get on your job,
Commandos!
- Now into the corner.
- Get in there.
Batavia's got these guys on the run.
One, one, one, one!
One, one, one, one.!
But in the third quarter, the Commandos charge back.
And a steal by Marshall.!
Agee gonna take it all the way.
Yes! That's the way you go!
- here we go.
- Picked him clean.
Dale. Marshall leads.
Marshall's first lead since the first quarter.
Like a lightning bolt, the Commandos have struck.
37-36, Marshall leading Batavia.
Chicago Marshall has exploded-
I always dreamed of,like... me and William taking them downstate together.
When I was at St. Joseph... maybe we could have went downstate, and maybe we couldn't.
But we did when I'm at Marshall.
Arthur's big fourth quarter helps add Batavia... to Marshall's growing list of upsets.
Spectacular comeback in the fourth quarter by the Commandos-
In the postgame news conference...
Coach Bedford labels his unranked team "the giant killers. '"
- Y'all are playing the number one team.
- We're playing the number one team.
We're playing the number two team.
This is the first time in the history of the school that we've gone this far.
- Really?
- In the history of the school.
Just like the Commandos.
See, we been the underdog.
I'm glad we are because then it just show you how you could come up.
And then you beat your opponent.
Oh,yeah.
Be a good place for Man to come.
Yeah. This is really, you know, something that a - a child would really miss out on.
Like a whole different world.
It's beyond different.
Uh-huh.
In this semifinal game, we'll see some great individuals... just as we saw many years ago.
Remember Isiah Thomas, one of the great guards. here you see the same moves he plays with in the NBA today.
Well, we've got someone like that: howard Nathan, number 34... for Peoria Manual.
Marshall got here because of one reason: quickness.
The reason: Arthur Agee.
Look at this man. he just explodes, Dan. he can get downcourt as quick as anyone I've ever seen.
In the semifinals...
Arthur goes head-to-head with howard Nathan, the all-American.
Make him work for it, Man.
Make him work for what he get.
All right! Let's go!
All the way, Man! All the way!
Yeah! That's it! That's it! That's it!
Arthur Agee, spinning inside, tough shot. Good.
Arthur has a great first half... but the Rams play even better. he's got it.
Get up for the Rams!
Everybody get up!
Get up for the Rams.!
In the second half,
Arthur tries to pick up where he left off.
Penetration move by Agee. Slapped out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.
Ooh, and a nice fake and a score.
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat... pressing the tempo against the tired Commandos.
You're not in the offense at all.
You're just out there playing individual basketball.
Completely. hey, hey, guys. No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going. Remember?
Let's go, Marshall!
Let's go!
Let's go, Marshall.!
Let's go.!
Marshall showed us last night they have the ability to come back.
Let's see what they can do here.
This is Nathan.
Nice pass.
Knock it down.
Biggest lead of the game now, and the Rams fans can smell it.
Been a great run for Luther Bedford's team.
The string of upsets stops here.
- And a foul on Agee.
- he fouls out.
But hejust never quit. hejust kept going for the basketball.
I wouldn't be surprised ifhe made the all-tournament team tonight.
- Number one!
- We're number one.!
We're still number one.
All right. All right.
Though they lose to Peoria Manual... they finish third in the state, the highest a Marshall team has finished since 1960.
This was a great season you had.
There is nothing sweeter than going downstate as a young person.
I mean, the record's gonna stay there, you know.
1991, there was a team from Marshall played.
- You know, and you're part of that.
- Yeah.
- That's part of history.
- Ah!
But for you seniors,you know-
Best wishes to all you seniors, and whatever you try to do, uh...
Mr. Williams and I will be around school... as we always are - to help you if you want to be helped, okay?
Winning five games in six days, that really takes a lot out of you.
Like Coach said,you just gotta sacrifice- you know, sacrifice everything you have.
Like, if you love the game of basketball, you just go out there and give all your heart. he got a little ways to go, but he's - he's gonna get there. hopefully he's got his head screwed on pretty good, you know... and now, you know, he's gonna be on his own to do whatever. hopefully he'll do it right.
When we got down here, people don't expect -
"Marshall? how'd they get down here?"
They lookin' like: "Who they got on their team?"
I had to come out and prove myself.
I think I could play Division I basketball.
'Cause all I need is just a scholarship.
That's -That's all I'm looking for.
Arthur Agee.
All right!
All this area through here is our new computer labs.
We'll take you through all those rooms.
Arthur's first recruiting visit... takes him to a junior college in Southern Missouri.
The strength that I see here is the tremendous teaching that goes on here. have you decided what you want to go into?
Uh, communications.
Are you more interested in the overall communications -
That, and, uh -
I like that and accounting.
- Like business.
- Oh. Okay.
We enjoy winning things, but the primary purpose is your education.
What are some of your career goals, may I ask?
I want to fall back to, like, make - have my own business.
Like real estate.
This is where it all happens.
Beautiful place.
And it gets to rockin;
- You gonna try it on there?
- Yeah.
Those are about $ 120 apiece.
You need to be very careful with this decision.
You know, if you come in and act right, you're going out ofhere... with two years of your college finished... a scholarship to a Division I university.
Exactly where you'd want to be- on track to graduate in four years.
Mineral Area doesn't have dorms... but it does have a basketball house.
All the ballplayers on scholarship live here.
Get your ass up, nigga.
Of the seven blacks in the entire school... six live in this house.
You come in and look at this little house, then after a while you get used to it.
Try to make a little home, you know. home away from home anyway.
We hang around each other most of the time.
We know who to trust, who not to trust.
I just want to go somewhere where I'm gonna play.
I can get the grades.
I love basketball. how many of your players that leave there and they end up going to a four-year college?
- Thirty-one sophomores in a row.
- Really?
Every last one of'em he coached.
- hi. how you doing?
- hey. how you doing?
- Arthur Sr.
- Bo and Sheila have been separated.
She asked him to return today over Arthur's objections.
I'll show you exactly what the scholarship entails.
Is this a full scholarship for the two years?
The reason I'm skeptical is because of the promises that was made in the past.
From the time he comes down there until he leaves, you will not have a financial need.
Now, when you make this decision... you got to live and die with it.
'Cause it's your decision to make.
Now, I'm here to support you if you - if you done searched this whole thing.
And it's what you really want.
Not,you know,
'cause Mama said this or your dad-
Or because you're saving
Mama money, because if we have to... we will still pay- if you have to try to pay- if we can put some-
I'm just sayin;
You - Understand what you're saying.
You want to save somebody money, but still -
But you have to still do what is best from here.
But still we want the best for you - even if you have to - or we have to go in the hole, you know.
You understand what I'm saying? I'm just saying.
But still, the decision is up to you.
So, what do you think?
Ah.
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.
- What time is it?
Come on, Bo.
Whip it to him.
When I was 23, how old was he?
And I whupped him then.
Aw!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain.!
- You want to see it rain?
- One more time.
Let it rain!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain!
Oh!
Peoria Manual.
Remember what they did to you now.
Yeah. Do you know howard Nathan?
And I strung him up, just like that.
Uh-oh. Like father, like son.
What's up with that?
You better stick to church music, leave that basketball alone. hell, no. You can't do that.
Foul! Foul!
Foul. Foul, foul, foul.
- That's 32.
- That's 34.
- That didn't count 'cause he called "Bo. "
- That's 34!
- That's 32!
- he didn't hit nothing else.!
- I did!
- he didn't hit nothing else!
- It's 34-28, Bo.
- Bo's a sore loser.
- All right!
- No. I know how to count though.
- Ain't no con game. I'm older now.
- Yeah.
- Ain't no con game going on no more.
- No more. Ain't no more.
- The score is 32 to 28.
Now, you can play for 32 if you want to.
Game over with.
I can con too.
Losers quit. I'm ready to play.
Now,youse a coward if you don't-
Check ball.
- You're mad now.
- Check ball.
- Throw it over there.
- You ain't two years old.
You ain't gettin' no pacifier.
- Give me that.
- Yeah.
Your mama ain't here to give you this ball. Let's go.
- Give me the rock.
- Let's make it rain. Make it rain.
Bang. Bang. Right there. ha! Go sit down.
Go sit down.
Bo, it's raining.!
Bo, it's raining.
- It's raining, Bo!
- It's raining, Bo!
You're on punishment when you get home.
You're on punishment when you get home.
And you're on punishment when you get home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
It's gonna rain on your head, Bo.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen... and welcome to St. Joseph's
Annual Basketball Awards Dinner.
We had a... difficult year.
Most of you are aware of that.
When I first went to St. Joe's,
I really did sleep, eat and drink basketball.
That was all I did.
But it became more of a job than a sport to play.
Things here have not changed since-
You know, Coach Pingatore just had these dreams in his head. hejust wanted me to go the same route he took Isiah.
The most steals. he played as a freshman.
Not even Isiah was a four-year starter.
You know, basketball was just like- he was possessed with it.
You know, it was his life.
And he wanted it to be everybody else's life too.
All-conference in the SCC.
All-state in the Sun-Times.
A McDonald All-American nomination.
M. V.P., 1990-1991 season,
William Gates.
When I had some real problems...
I couldn't go to none of them about it.
You know, I was having some problems with Catherine's family and my family... and I said, you know, "Coach Pingatore, their family's been getting on me about... you know, I'm not doing this, and I'm not doing that. "
And the only thing
Coach Pingatore could say is...
"Write 'em off. "
That was all he told me.
And I was, like, "What kind of advice is that?"
Well, how's it feel to be finishing?
Uh, I mean-
Now, don't say anything you don't mean, William.
I mean, I'm serious, Coach.
I enjoyed my four years.
I mean, we had our run-ins, and, uh -
- Who had run-ins?
- Me and you.
- We did?
- Yeah. Like that time you made me run 75 stairs.
- I never f-
- You never forgot that.
Never.
See,you should have been happy and enthusiastic about doing your punishment.
But someday you're gonna learn that, uh... everything that was done was for your benefit.
So that you can come back four years from now and say, "Coach,you were right.
"Everything that happened at St. Joe's helped me a lot... and as a result I got a degree. '"
That's what I'm hoping for.
I'm going into communication... so when you start asking for a donation,
I'll know the right way to turn you down.
I'm sure you'll never turn us down.
Ah.
I never really felt that he bought into the system. he was never convinced what he was doing was the right thing to do.
But overall he had a good career- not a great career.
It's never good-bye.
Could've been different if the injury didn't occur.
But it did occur.
- And that was the big difference.
- I'm proud of what you did.
- Okay.
- I expect you to do a lot better.
I don't want this to be the-
- Yeah.
- You know, the highlight of your career.
You've got a lot of bigger and better things to do.
I'll see you later.
Good luck.
Well... another one walks out the door, and another one comes in the door.
That's what it's all about.
It came through for me.
- Got the score I needed.
- All right.
And, hey...
I'm eligible.
You know, this is one of the greatest feelings in the world. That's about it.
I mean -
After five attempts,
William's composite score of 17.5... is rounded up to 18... and he can finally accept a scholarship to play at Marquette.
I think my mom... all through high school really, really was proud of me.
She said, "Everybody's throwing their dreams into you... but you got to throw your own dreams into yourself. '"
When I gave her the diploma after the graduation... she was, like,
"This is it, one of my proudest moments. '"
My baby graduated.
Curtis always wanted to go to Marquette... and his grades weren't good enough for him to go... and now it's like he got the grades,you know?
Excuse me, Curtis.
You gonna give anybody else a chance?
What two countries are we competing with for world trade?
Before Arthur can graduate, he must pass summer school.
And for the first time in three years,
Shannon isn't there with him.
The other country, of course, we said- he thought he could sell drugs and don't get caught,you know.
But he found out the hard way.
And I told him, while he was doing all that -
I wasn't hanging with Shannon then.
I was like, man, "Shannon, you should stop, man.
Stop doing that stuff. "
We always said we weren't gonna never do no stufflike that.
We werejust gonna go on and graduate and go on to college.
But,you know, he had to be the one.
One week before his graduation,
Arthur is robbed at gunpoint.
At first I thought he was gonna shoot me because I didn't have no money.
'Cause he kept asking me, "You got -
You got some money. Where your wallet at?"
Be like, "What you driving a car like this for?"
I was, like, "I ain't got no wallet. "
And then,you know, he grabbed me and stuff,and I was- and I was about to panic and stuff, and I just calmed down.
I sit down and had a long talk with him and his sister.
Someone pulled a pistol on her right down the street from the house.
I said, "Do you all understand what is going on out here in these streets today?'"
Even with me, when I was out there - you know, out there strung out - you know, I looked for somebody that seemed like they had something. hmm. After this, I -
I - I'm ready.
I'm ready to leave.
'Cause there ain't no -
Everybody up here going to jail or- or either in drugs.
Or dead.
James Davis.
Arthur Agee.
Please hold your applause so everyone can hear.
Christine Bowman.
Erica Byrd.
Sandra Crockett.
I never thought he would get to the place where he's at now.
Arthur's self-esteem was really drained from St. Joseph's.
I said, "Well,you are somebody.
"No matter where you go, it's what you have in your heart... that you're gonna go somewhere. '"
Come on.
Move out of the way, boy.
Everybody out there, there's gonna be a party tonight. There's gonna be a party tonight.
You know it.
These flame-broiled burgers -
It's scary, man. I'm telling you.
I'm telling you the truth.
Scary generation, man.
- I thought you might hit me in my head, fool.
- I didn't hit you in your head.
To my son.
I hope you pursue all your dreams and your desires... that you have within you.
I love you very much.
- Ooh, that is so nice.
- Whatever.
Oh, no.!
God, we thank you for this day, Lord.
And we ask you to go with junior, Lord.
And we thank you, Lord. Go with him as he try to better his education, Lord.
And we thank you for him for coming this far.
We came this far by faith, Lord.
And we ask you, Father, when he get in college, Lord... to keep him, Lord- keep him protected.
We thank you for him,Jesus.
- In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
- Amen.
Oh,you can cry like a river, girl.
You're crying so bad,
I won't even make fun of you.
Oh, God.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
I want you to be good, okay?
And don't, uh, get mixed up in none of that old stuff that, uh, you know.
I done told you what to do.
Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers.
None of that stuff.
Bye-bye.
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.
Once he get in the door,
I want him to stay in there for four years.
Think he gonna make it?
You do?
I think he gonna make it.
Well, I hope so anyway.
When I was young- When I was little, that's all I used to think about- the NBA.
If I set my mind, I can - I can go.
I can st - I can go.
Get in good college. I can go.
But if I don't, you know, I ain't gonna be no drug dealer, you know... cry about it, come back and, you know... stick up gas stations or nothing like that, you know.
Probably go into comedian or architecture, something like that.
You don't think that you'll have the kind of tough times like your dad's been through?
No.
I can't say- I can't say that I will.
I can't say that I don't. I don't know.
Four years ago, that's all
I used to dream about was playing in the NBA.
I don't really dream about it like that anymore.
You know, even though...
I love playing basketball, but, you know...
I want to do other things with my life too.
- Say, "hi, Daddy. '"
- hi, Daddy.
- "how you doing?'"
- how you doing?
- Say, "I love you. '"
- I love you.
If I had to stop playing basketball right now, I think I'd still be happy.
- I think I would.
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Where'd Daddy get to?
- Uh, Marquette.
Marquette?
That's why when somebody say,you know...
"When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me,
'"and all that stuff...
I should say to them,
"Well, if I don't make it, watch you don't forget about me. '"

{261}{312}We're not here to annihilate everything.

{1448}{1513}True infestation, if I|the comment, sir ...
{1653}{1755}Rosen, you ... good vision ...|- Positive, sir ...
{2273}{2328}Right ... catch them!
{2764}{2805}I love hunting creatures ...
{3028}{3165}{y:i} There's nothing wrong with your television.|Do not attempt to adjust the picture.
{3166}{3237}{y:i} For now we have|control of transmission.
{3238}{3333}{y:i} We control|horizontal and vertical.
{3334}{3405}{y:i} You can insert thousands|channels ...
{3406}{3558}{y:i} or expand an image|with crystal clarity ... and beyond.
{3563}{3643}{y:i} We can tailor your vision|anything

{4593}{4644}{y:i} physical as well as mental.
{4645}{4728}{y:i} But in the heat of the struggle,|reality can sometimes fade,
{4729}{4843}{y:i} like memory,|only one thing remains certain...
{4844}{4963}{y:i} the first casualty of war|is truth.
{4970}{5035}I can not see anything.

{5206}{5275}Creatures|They are not gonna like it.
{5277}{5323}These kids want persium.
{5324}{5380}Which is only found here.
{5385}{5450}On this planet.|That belongs to us!
{5512}{5586}Archer, no living alien?|- Negative, sir,
{5588}{5655}tracking satellite will only|pass five hours.
{5656}{5730}They know what it means ...|Lets enter...
{5757}{5821}All ready?|- Yes sir!
{5829}{5874}Yes sir,|- Yes sir...
{5914}{5951}Yes sir...|- Good...
{5970}{6042}So prepare weapons ...|and follow the protocol ...
{6330}{6358}Damn it...
{6675}{6737}What's wrong, Hawthorne?|Go ahead...
{6740}{6768}I'm trying, sir ...
{6771}{6841}It is a procedure to follow.|Follow the protocol.
{6842}{6903}Any possible meeting|with alien forces, should
{6904}{6975}be preceded by self-inoculation|to prevent infection.
{6976}{7014}Yes, sir, I know|the rules, sir!
{7015}{7074}It is because|the alien parasites.
{7075}{7121}Their bodies rotting|They are full of them.
{7122}{7186}They are spirochetes calls,|Sir, bacteria ...
{7187}{7218}I learned this|in training, sir.
{7219}{7310}Oh, really. In this case,|I might explain one thing,
{7311}{7382}because I always wanted to know|what hurts the most,
{7383}{7485}wounds in the skin or|brain hallucinations?
{7502}{7543}I am sorry, sir, I do not know ...
{7544}{7600}I only ask because when|our last doctor
{7602}{7672}He caught the disease,|he did not stop screaming ...
{7697}{7766}Well, in the end, he stopped ...
{7831}{7857}What the hell!
{8104}{8171}You have to release the lock|and opening the exhaust valve
{8172}{8205}before you can pump ...
{8207}{8279}It has to be perfectly|aligned to function.
{8315}{8392}It's not as easy as in training.|- Really...
{8393}{8425}Thank you, Lieutenant!
{8483}{8504}Lieutenant...
{8533}{8610}When the doctor got the disease,|How long did it take to die?
{8722}{8785}He did not die, he lost|by foot infection.
{8786}{8826}Returned home,|A week ago.
{9638}{9674}Free approach ...
{10114}{10161}I liked|what I've done with the place ...
{10197}{10235}Archer, quantity ...
{10415}{10487}It has a visual confirmation|Eleven bodies, Captain ...
{10487}{10561}So, it is still missing|an enemy, personal ...
{10563}{10596}keen eye ...
{11251}{11283}Stay together...
{11286}{11312}and be quiet ...
{12120}{12180}Certainly, the target|I am still alive, Captain ...
{12181}{12228}I tried, but|I missed the target, sir ...
{12229}{12264}Understood, Sergeant ...
{12285}{12348}All right, guys, let's|mark a perimeter.
{12349}{12417}Let's not let the bastard|pass us by ...
{13017}{13067}{y:i} Rosen, he's going|in your direction, you can confirm ...
{13093}{13114}Negative...
{13266}{13309}Well, pay attention all ...
{13310}{13362}we have to surround you ...
{13379}{13451}Eldritch, take the northern corridor|and join the Archer ...
{13452}{13508}Rosen, Hawthorne, take shelter, ...
{13509}{13546}and maintain the positions.
{13570}{13623}I'll arrive|the southeast passage.
{14448}{14472}Get down...
{15102}{15160}All right?|- All...
{15161}{15189}This is serious?
{15191}{15264}Not at all sir,|it's just a slight scratch on his chest
{15266}{15345}The shot passed through her jacket,|It was only grazed.
{15357}{15421}It seems that today was your day|luck, Lieutenant!
{15460}{15498}Good job!|- Thank you sir...
{15570}{15637}The last enemy|was settled, sir!
{15649}{15683}Disgusting creature!
{15994}{16040}'re In trouble,|cable?
{16041}{16056}No sir...
{16057}{16141}I think it's ... these creatures|scare you, right?
{16148}{16198}Absolutely, and you know why?
{16201}{16241}Because they hate you!
{16244}{16292}And if you do not learn|to hate them too,
{16293}{16344}You can be sure|that they're going to kill you.
{16349}{16412}Now he arrives. You two...
{16474}{16505}Come on...
{16927}{16967}Okay, people, relax ...
{16968}{17025}and then prepare|for advancement.
{17027}{17047}Captain...
{17114}{17169}it seems that we visit,|creatures ...
{17170}{17224}But as passed|By our traps?
{17253}{17299}Traps|They were not armed.
{17335}{17366}Because?
{17367}{17409}Captain, I thought ...
{17458}{17507}I'm sure|which I have laid the explosives ...
{17508}{17570}Half of our food and ammunition|They were here, Hawthorne!
{17571}{17634}Things much more needed|than a doctor!
{17788}{17845}I want a full inventory|all that's left.
{17847}{17908}Nobody touches anything,|unless they are clean.
{17911}{17958}The whole place should|be contaminated.
{18414}{18450}Can I sit here?
{18476}{18497}Of course...
{18653}{18732}Hawthorne ...|what are you doing here?
{18807}{18862}I started college|medicine when the government
{18863}{18905}He began recruiting people.
{18919}{18987}They said that the aliens|persium wanted, and it was
{18988}{19071}our responsibility|protect what was rightfully ours.
{19165}{19226}I thought coming here was|the right decision.
{19255}{19298}So you're an idealist?
{19346}{19373}Yeah, I think it was ...
{19374}{19418}All right, guys, listen ...
{19469}{19540}Just make contact|one of our satellites.
{19541}{19612}I found that has a factory|alien ammunition in the region
{19614}{19684}and it seems that the plant enters|operating in 31 hours.
{19685}{19761}And if it does, the creatures go|stay in great advantage here.
{19762}{19826}Perhaps, is what is missing|to manage to drive us out.
{19828}{19899}We are the only unit|You can get there in time, folks.
{19900}{19929}That's it...
{20128}{20157}What is the problem?
{20353}{20382}What's it?
{20480}{20523}Take a look|for you it?
{20526}{20571}What about you?
{20574}{20631}Do not remember|as the earth was before?
{20651}{20732}Forty years ago, the electricity|It is missing everywhere.
{20733}{20787}And it caused|chaos in the cities.
{20788}{20847}Countries came into war|for energy, yes!
{20852}{20962}Yeah, and thanks to us all, countries|Earth got the persium
{20963}{21029}for heating and food|people, to touch the economy ...
{21051}{21096}The Earth not|It is most needed,
{21098}{21141}It is no longer necessary|They kill each other.
{21141}{21200}And when the Earth could|finally be at peace,
{21201}{21276}the beasts came and put everything|all this at risk.
{21341}{21435}So, when you feel|tired and hungry
{21436}{21482}and even with a little|of fear, think about it
{21484}{21518}and never forget!
{21528}{21605}Right, sir!|- Well, we leave in three hours ...
{22020}{22068}It has tunnels throughout the region.
{22070}{22166}If we continue in this direction, we will|arrive at an abandoned mine.
{22168}{22223}We may use the recesses|the mine to reach
{22225}{22255}in the ammunition factory.
{22267}{22329}How far?|- 45 km ...
{22365}{22442}Great. We are on a planet|where the night lasts six months,
{22443}{22487}and we are walking|in caves.
{22488}{22511}Rosen ...
{22512}{22593}He complained that much during|the training of lack of sun?
{22594}{22633}No, sir, he slept well ...
{23025}{23055}I think we have company ...
{23057}{23089}Hear that?
{23089}{23113}What?
{23190}{23223}Archer, what do you see?
{23338}{23372}Only we, sir ...
{23445}{23480}The area is free ...
{23549}{23600}Well, I hope|it stays that way ...
{24515}{24530}Hang on...
{24562}{24599}Archer, use the scanner ...
{24837}{24915}The satellite shows a laser network|just ahead, Captain.
{24915}{24952}I can see well.
{24953}{25014}It should be ready|to explode.
{25050}{25116}You can remove the detonator with|a special grenade, Sergeant?
{25117}{25163}I've got one here.|- Do it...
{25532}{25557}Fell one!
{25653}{25693}What is it, who fell?
{25693}{25721}I thought it was you ...
{25778}{25801}What's it?
{25808}{25834}What happened?
{25835}{25892}Nothing, sir, we|disassemble the trap.
{25893}{25944}It's my fault, I thought|who had requested help ...
{26026}{26052}It's all right...
{26060}{26110}it is better to err on the side ...
{26139}{26182}Well, it will be|increasingly difficult,
{26183}{26241}there may be many pitfalls|ahead.
{26242}{26278}Perhaps even sentries.
{26302}{26350}We will immunize|before leaving.
{26973}{27081}From what I can tell, sir, the valve|internal exhaust is blocked.
{27082}{27158}Each time it was triggered,|the internal pressure increased,
{27159}{27194}until the passage closed.
{27196}{27244}I think it was when|They reached the station.
{27249}{27304}One of the bullets must have passed|Close enough,
{27305}{27354}to have reached the valves|without achieving anything more.
{27355}{27408}Therefore, the ejection seems|not be broken.
{27409}{27481}Captain, means not received my|doses since I left the station.
{27690}{27752}I'm fine, Eldritch ...|- Yeah I know...
{27830}{27894}Our guns reserves|They lost with the supplies.
{27894}{27939}This means|A big problem.
{28004}{28050}What do you suggest|I do, Corporal?
{28136}{28193}We can try to change|our own guns
{28195}{28232}and dose the lieutenant|with them.
{28233}{28263}It will work?
{28314}{28352}Maybe...|- Oh, no, no, no ...
{28353}{28428}I will not risk other members|the group by a perhaps cable!
{28577}{28637}Captain, we do not|We have no alternative.
{28638}{28718}I try to take another medication for|while, but if the Lieutenant Rosen
{28720}{28822}find another creature, chances|of infection they are too big.
{29040}{29061}Lieutenant,
{29064}{29140}this plant begins operating|for 22 hours.
{29142}{29229}I need you, and you know the risk.|- I understand that, sir ...
{29248}{29299}At the first sign of infection,
{29347}{29385}you stay alone ...
{29836}{29894}I only see a sentry|the mine entrance.
{29896}{29924}What you see, Archer?
{29946}{30018}Are other funds for a|good reception of the satellite, Captain.
{30019}{30066}If there are still enemies|in the area,
{30095}{30128}I will not pick them up ...
{30183}{30229}He must have rear.
{30258}{30308}Sure, silence total.
{30309}{30337}Hit it.
{30678}{30737}What are you waiting for,|It is an easy target!
{30738}{30784}If hit him now,|it falls in the open,
{30785}{30852}so if you do not want the site|which can be seen ...
{31140}{31207}What's it?|- Anything...
{31567}{31591}Damn it...
{31593}{31624}She missed!
{31725}{31759}He fell...
{31762}{31787}Good job!
{31789}{31841}But what happened?|- I do not know, sir ...
{31843}{31912}But, I know, of course, Captain,|she caught the germ, it is infected.
{31913}{31979}It's not possible. I tested her blood|an hour ago, I was normal ...
{31980}{32021}Coming from you,|does not mean much ...
{32021}{32044}Enough!
{32185}{32207}Archer?
{32221}{32260}You can see the sentry?
{32300}{32339}I'm not sure, Captain!
{32392}{32416}Eldritch,
{32418}{32511}take Archer and Hawthorne, return|àquela mine and explode it.
{32519}{32587}Do not forget immunization.|I'm going back.
{32587}{32630}Captain, I think|It is not a good ideia...
{32631}{32679}Just give an order,|sergeant!
{32692}{32719}Yes sir...
{33123}{33197}Okay, talk ... what's happening?|- I do not know well, sir ...
{33197}{33219}You can speak...
{33286}{33348}Something happened|me at the station, sir.
{33350}{33408}I've never been so close|the one before.
{33420}{33473}I saw his face|when I shot ...
{33521}{33578}That image|not on my mind ...
{33589}{33626}And when I think about it ...
{33684}{33734}almost feel|a killer ...
{33737}{33793}Killed a creature|who was trying to kill you ...
{33794}{33845}Just acted like it was trained.
{33859}{33885}I know...
{33900}{33955}Maybe I did not serve|to be welded ...
{34027}{34046}Rosen ...
{34053}{34077}Yes sir...
{34103}{34132}I know it has|many people on Earth
{34133}{34197}who believes not|if you need more war ...
{34222}{34322}But it takes more than a few decades|peace to change human nature.
{34358}{34394}You are voluntary|for this fight ...
{34395}{34444}and I've seen what you can do ...
{34446}{34525}And I have no doubts|I'm a soldier.
{34597}{34643}But if you lose|your confidence,
{34644}{34722}you become a drag on|this group and to herself.
{34777}{34861}You're second in command|because I trust you to protect me.
{34890}{34933}If you can no longer|do that...
{34934}{34979}it is better to say now ...
{35053}{35096}I can continue, sir ...
{35158}{35182}Come on...
{35535}{35580}And the explosions, Sergeant!
{35582}{35638}We are finishing putting|detonators, Captain!
{35639}{35724}Just a few more minutes, sir ...|- Well, I'll patrol the area ...
{35734}{35775}Hawthorne, come with me!
{35779}{35839}Stay and mount the guard!
{35842}{35911}Keep good distance from that thing.|- That's not necessary, sir ...
{35912}{35993}I burned|and esterilizei the whole area.
{35995}{36062}The Rosen lieutenant not in danger|of infection here, sir!
{36064}{36110}I like your initiative, cable!
{36115}{36139}Yes sir...
{36180}{36206}Come on...
{36663}{36724}He does not have much way|soldier, right?
{36725}{36779}Why now,|he's a dead soldier!
{36780}{36837}And for all we know,|he could be a child!
{36875}{36921}That's what we are killing now?
{37000}{37031}Innocent civilians?
{37127}{37199}To tell the truth,|I do not care!
{37201}{37252}The aliens began|this war,
{37253}{37323}and in my opinion, each|one of them is a possible target.
{37331}{37400}And anything|load weapon, not a civil ...
{37401}{37451}I expect|do not forget that...
{37452}{37474}Mrs...
{37561}{37618}Still has something|on the other side, sir ...
{37861}{37918}{y:i} Quick, let's back,|let's back ...
{37968}{38004}{y:i} Where are you coming from?
{38005}{38031}{y:i} I do not know ...
{38539}{38558}{y:i} Captain ...
{38609}{38625}{y:i} Captain ...
{38654}{38678}{y:i} Hawthorne!
{39690}{39771}You all right, Hawthorne?|- I tried bio-regeneration ...
{39831}{39877}But nothing|I could do for him ... sir ...
{39930}{39963}The injuries were|enormous.
{39964}{40006}He was hit|more than 12 times in the chest.
{40160}{40208}There's no signs of pursuit,|Mrs!
{40209}{40260}The creatures should think|we die, Lieutenant.
{40488}{40519}What are you looking at?
{40543}{40615}These bullets, for me, do not look|have come from alien weapon!
{40699}{40759}Is this some kind of accusation,|Mrs?
{40760}{40796}I'm not accusing anyone|you are welcome!
{40798}{40874}No, you only suggesting that this|the captain was killed by our weapon.
{40875}{40903}We should investigate ...
{40927}{40951}Does that bother you?
{40952}{41045}To me, it was his mistake that left us|in this situation to begin with.
{41047}{41088}If it bothers someone,|it's you ...
{41089}{41131}The captain died|and no matter who is to blame.
{41167}{41222}We still have a mission|to do.
{41265}{41301}Yes it's true...
{41320}{41404}But I do not think the lieutenant|has condition to command!
{41405}{41447}I'm in charge, Sergeant!
{41481}{41555}Certainly, the Hawthorne cable|You think me capable of this task!
{41608}{41682}Yes for sure...
{41788}{41817}It's enough for me ...
{41818}{41862}What are the orders, Lieutenant?
{41905}{41999}To get there in time,|we can not take the captain together.
{42000}{42054}Take everything from him, let's go.
{42129}{42159}Yes ma'am!
{42556}{42603}Already we should be close.
{42605}{42629}That's it.
{42845}{42922}Lieutenant, we are|just below the plant.
{44178}{44200}What do you see?
{44202}{44320}The broadcast shows various creatures|in the workplace. There are two of them here.
{44335}{44406}Let's approach the|service corridors.
{44407}{44454}Okay, I'll give you that.
{44456}{44547}Lieutenant, I think it's time|yet another blood sample.
{44674}{44722}So take a look.|In silence...
{44943}{44996}Well, your luck|still persists, sir.
{45005}{45051}The blood is clean.
{45070}{45106}No spirochetes traits.
{45204}{45267}You know psychosis caused|by spirochetes?
{45271}{45339}Well, just the ones I've seen in videos|training.
{45340}{45413}Nothing you've seen in action,|certainly.
{45480}{45545}In fact, I never saw|psychosis in action.
{45564}{45598}No single case.
{45659}{45701}I had not thought.
{45998}{46034}Drugs of our guns ...
{46041}{46082}You know how they work?
{46091}{46161}Well, I do not give|many medical details, lady!
{46197}{46286}But I heard that the alien DNA|It is quite different from ours.
{46287}{46341}And it's hard to deal with it.
{46348}{46432}Therefore, drugs are genetically|produced for each individual.
{46434}{46506}But other than that,|The composition is confidential.
{46664}{46710}It is concerned|with something, ma'am?
{46794}{46847}Remember I asked you|why are you here?
{46854}{46868}Yeah...
{46923}{46974}I'm wondering|the same thing.
{47022}{47046}Lieutenant,
{47051}{47130}With all the respect,|I think ... that lady
{47131}{47173}should remember|than the captain said ...
{47174}{47214}because he was right.
{47221}{47261}Our mission|here is important.
{47312}{47355}I'm not so sure.
{47379}{47439}Lieutenant, I do not know well|what do you mean by that,
{47440}{47513}but I suggest you not discuss it|in front of Eldritch Sgt.
{47514}{47556}If you want|continue in command.
{47640}{47695}Well over an examination|no problem, lady ...
{47736}{47801}What lies ahead?|- Hard to say, lady!
{47802}{47870}The equipment energy emission|of them interfere with our sensors.
{47872}{47974}But they are low on defense. And ten|or more enemies in the area, ma'am.
{47976}{48002}What do you recommend?
{48004}{48072}Make the low attack.|A quick action.
{48072}{48108}Let's get ready ...
{48192}{48295}Lieutenant, guns need replenishing.|You want me to take care of it now.
{48296}{48320}Yes, proceed ...
{48320}{48357}I will recolhar empty.
{49522}{49549}Everybody immunized?
{49558}{49579}Yes ma'am...
{49580}{49630}Yes ma'am...|- Yes ma'am...
{50618}{50640}Lieutenant?
{50680}{50709}I'm in position.
{50800}{50829}I am too...
{50915}{50949}All ready, Lieutenant ...
{51357}{51409}{y:i} Production|It begins in a few hours ...
{51548}{51568}Draw back ...
{51582}{51597}What?
{51598}{51656}{y:i} Withdraw-up, cancel, it's an order ...|- Because?
{51663}{51699}They're not aliens ...
{51793}{51824}Mr...
{52042}{52124}What do you think you're doing,|there were at least twelve aliens there ...
{52124}{52168}No, they're human beings ...
{52168}{52217}You are not well...|- Listen to me...
{52238}{52282}You remember what happened|at the station?
{52283}{52311}What it|It has to do with it?
{52312}{52342}You listen to me!
{52404}{52433}What did you see?
{52434}{52459}I saw a creature ...
{52463}{52505}I shot and missed ...
{52529}{52644}Think, concentrate as much as possible|at that time ... what he saw there ...
{52754}{52783}What did you see?
{52855}{52891}What did you see?
{52944}{52973}Era...
{53039}{53104}It was ... a creature,|as I said...
{53181}{53205}And you?
{53248}{53303}I only saw a second,|Lieutenant, maybe less ...
{53305}{53342}Think again what ...|what he saw ...
{53443}{53474}I'm not sure...
{53685}{53759}Yeah ... maybe|were human ...
{53946}{53960}And they were ...
{53970}{54018}There were no aliens|that station.
{54116}{54159}And there is not any here ...
{54161}{54206}So, as explained|what we have seen?
{54207}{54277}I do not know right, can be a|type of memory implant ...
{54277}{54313}I can not handle it anymore!
{54313}{54378}You're crazy and is trying|crazy in too ...
{54379}{54430}How we do not realize|this before?
{54442}{54488}The drugs we take|Immunization!
{54493}{54541}Should strengthen|the implant's memory.
{54543}{54618}When my gun spoiled,|my implant began to fail ...
{54619}{54692}Yeah, but your gun spoiled|because you got shot.
{54785}{54845}And as we can see|with these implants?
{54958}{55008}Is that sabotaged their guns!
{55039}{55112}Traded drugs tubes|by a supply of glucose!
{55114}{55154}For them to see the truth ...
{55214}{55241}I kill you...
{55242}{55287}Please sergeant,|the path is not this!
{55289}{55361}Good advice, cable,|should listen to yourself ...
{55564}{55590}What's with you?
{55591}{55648}Both want to fight, that|They do not call anymore who they kill?
{55744}{55803}You had no right|to fuss with guns!
{55804}{55870}This is a court-martial case|you can run.
{55871}{55950}Lieutenant, you are risking|our lives, just for a belief.
{55952}{55984}It is more than a belief!
{55989}{56032}I've had several close contacts|with the enemy
{56033}{56111}without drugs to protect me ...|and I'm still healthy ...
{56128}{56169}Why I was not infected?
{56200}{56239}There's no bacteria|alien!
{56241}{56286}Because there is not|alien!
{56287}{56332}If I was conditioning|like you said,
{56333}{56406}because when I look at you I see|a person, not a creature?
{56440}{56529}The images are formed in some way,|perhaps electronically.
{56531}{56610}And to what's such a complicated job,|just to create an enemy ...
{56677}{56710}The person|I killed at the station,
{56730}{56782}I think part|Asian Coalition ...
{56821}{56852}Our government knew|we could not convince
{56853}{56919}to a war|only to protect their profits ...
{56932}{57013}So, I decided to turn|miners in aliens.
{57014}{57072}What would be enemies|for our minds.
{57113}{57156}They made us|brainwashed ...
{57158}{57215}To kill|other human beings.
{57215}{57262}That's crazy!|- Oh yes...
{57298}{57334}Well, there's a way|to prove ...
{58075}{58103}My God!
{58166}{58233}Are here. Flee!
{58238}{58286}{y:i} Let us flee!
{58310}{58334}{y:i} Flee all ...
{58338}{58370}{y:i} Get out, flee ...
{58404}{58458}They have terrified us ...|- Of course you've got ...
{58459}{58497}Think|we will kill them ...
{58501}{58535}And got right ...
{59106}{59125}Listen...
{59137}{59161}please...
{59173}{59218}You do not have to be afraid...
{59235}{59278}Now we know the truth!
{59290}{59317}Yes, that's it!
{59339}{59389}This is where the killing stops!
{59643}{59676}No, no, no ... okay ...
{59676}{59715}No one will hurt you!
{59731}{59753}Please...
{59827}{59863}you do not have to be afraid...
{60017}{60057}We know the truth now!
{60069}{60108}We will not hurt you!
{60382}{60467}No, we know ...|they're human.
{60470}{60513}We did not come to fight ...
{60755}{60794}Disgusting creature!
{60873}{60909}No, do not go near!
{60933}{60976}Have to|be immunized first!
{61158}{61211}{y:i} Humans kill for love,
{61212}{61259}{y:i} for revenge, for survival,
{61260}{61304}{y:i} and even for ideas.
{61326}{61374}{y:i} Perhaps the capacity to kill then
{61375}{61455}{y:i} is a very true part of our nature
{61470}{61521}{y:i} But within this behavior,
{61522}{61570}{y:i} defined by fear,
{61572}{61618}{y:i} must we also be taught
{61620}{61652}{y:i} to hate?
Oh, wait a minute.
I forgot to do my test.
What test is that?
Well, I select a sandwich at random and try it.
If it doesn't meet my standards,
I put the lot of them in the bin.
They're fine.
There.
Ferrero Rocher?
Father Ted, with these Rocher you are realy spoiling us.
My housekeeper isn't the best.
Sometimes I think that it's me that should be making the tea for her!
Mrs Doyle.
(Ted) Mrs Doyle.
"Making the tea for her"!
I never thought we'd have anyone like her here.
Hm? Oh, Miss Clark. Yes, it's very exciting - a famous novelist, here.
You've never read any of her books, have you?
Actualy, I'm a bit of a fan.
That's where I was the other day - at her book signing.
I'm very surprised. I didn't think you'd like that sort of thing.
I read a bit of one once.
God, I couldn't finish it.
The language - unbelievable!
It's a bit gritty but that's the modern world.
Well, it was a bit much for me, Father.
- "Feck this" and "feck that".
- Yes, Mrs Doyle.
"You big bastard".
Oh, dreadful language.
"You big hairy arse".
"You big fecker".
Fierce stuff.
And of course, the F-word, Father.
The bad F-word, worse than "feck".
You know the one I mean?
Yes, I do, Mrs Doyle.
"F you". "F your F-ing wife".
Oh, why do they have to use language like that?
"I'll stick this F-ing pitchfork up your hole".
- That was another one, oh, yes.
- I see what you mean.
"Bastard this" and "bastard that".
It's wall-to-wall bastards.
- Is it? Anyway...
- "You bastard". "You fecker".
"You bollocks".
"Get your bollocks out of my face".
Yes, you just go and prepare for the nuns.
(Mrs Doyle) "Ride me sideways" is another one.
Happy Christmas, Mrs Doyle.
Oh, Father, you shouldn't have!
(Giggles) What is it?
It's a...
I was trying to think,
"What would Mrs Doyle realy love?"
Then I thought, "Something to take the misery out of making tea."
Yes, Mrs Doyle, the days of housekeepers making tea are over.
You've made your last cup of tea in this house!
Thank you, Father.
- Tea, Father?
- Oh! God Almighty, Mrs Doyle!
What are you doing up?
Oh, I always stay up in case one of you needs a cup of tea.
- How long have you been doing this?
- About three years now.
- But we never get up at night.
- Well, you're up now.
Unless I'm hallucinating from lack of sleep.
That's happened before, all right.
I'm just getting my jacket to go for a little walk.
Right so. www.opensubtitles.org subs by W-O-R-S-T

We've had some problem with Kerrey people ripping down our signs... but we're gonna take care of that.
- [Onlookers Laughing]
- Um, other than —
- [Man] They're gonna ask them not to.
- Yeah.
We also have a schizophrenic newspaper which, like... prints every shit possible on the front page and then apologizes in the editorial.
It's really bizarre.
The Tsongas sign on Route 3 lasted all of two days.
- It's gone now.
- [Laughter]
[Man] Those Harkin people are stealin' everyone's signs. It's amazing.
Short of, uh, calling for negative ads — although maybe — is there any effort underfoot to go after Tsongas?
Let's face it.
This guy cannot be squeaky clean.
[Man] Sure. Well, this is the question about that, and let's throw that out here.
The problem with attacking Senator Tsongas is —
I mean, we jokingly call him St. Paul.
It could really backfire against us to someone else's advantage.
- Absolutely.
- Um, and that's been —
That's what —
[Clears Throat]
[Man] And it'll look bad, because he's complimented him all along.
And then to come the last week and say that he's bad — I think it will look bad.
We have to do a better job of saying our differences.
We always seem to be defending.
We don't have to defend a damn thing.
We got the best — We know he's the best candidate, 'cause we've met him.
And if everybody in the state of New Hampshire met him... we wouldn't have a problem — we know that.
Thank you.
I'm glad to be with you.
I wasn't in the leather jacket group, but, uh... you know, I had a good time.
But I was a pretty straight kid.
I worked hard enough to make good grades... but I basically liked my music and my friends... and I had a heck of a good time when I was in high school.
We had a band in high school called
The Three Kings. I've still got a record.
You bet.
Thank you.

[Man Chuckling] He likes me.
He may not like Clinton, but he likes me.
I'll bet you I said something you could take out of context.
- You weird guys gotta stick together.
- Mm-hmm. [Laughing]
"Clinton and Brown have little in common except off-the-wall campaign gurus."
[All Laughing]
"Clinton's is James Carville, a Cajun who wears jeans with bright shirts.
Brown's is a Frenchman named Jacques Barzhagi... who wears jeans with a black leather jacket and black beret, indoors and out.
Carville says of Brown,
'He's just not us.'
Barzhagi says cryptically,
'Let them spin. We will win."'
[All Laughing]
You know my mother and them hates that.
They say, "Why do they portray you like that?
We were nice people.
We sent our children to college.
You go up there and you act like some kind of weirdo." [Laughing]
I said, "Ma, they're not interested in the fact that you sent me to college."

[Man]
Gennifer.
[Man #2]
Sit down.
Good afternoon.
This whole experience is not easy for me.
Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years... and for the past two years I have lied to the press about our relationship to protect him.
The truth is, I loved him.
Now he tells me to deny it.
Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit... and I'm sick of all of the lies.
- [Camera Shutters Clicking]
- [Reporters Chattering]
It's that way.
[Female Reporter] Mr. Clinton, what's your relationship with Gennifer Flowers?
There really isn't one, obviously.
[Chuckles]
I mean, the charges are false.
The, uh — Today she took money to publish a story... that she hired a lawyer to say was absolutely defamatory over a year ago.
And, uh, it's sad.
It's sad that this sort of thing could be published... in a newspaper like the Star which says Martians walk on the earth.
You'd never ask me if Martians walk on the earth.
[Male Reporter]
Will you comment on the tapes she has?
No. I can't. I haven't heard 'em.
[Flowers On Tape]
The reason I was calling was to tell you... that this last Wednesday, someone got into my apartment.
- [Man On Tape] Hold on a minute.
- [Flowers] Okay.
- [Man] So somebody broke in your apartment?
- [Flowers] Well, yeah.
There wasn't any sign of a break-in, but the drawers and things —
There wasn't anything missing that I could tell, but somebody had —
[Man] Somebody had gone through all your stuff.
[Flowers]
Had gone through my stuff.
[Man] You think they were -
But they didn't steal anything?
[Flowers] No. No. My jewelry -
I mean, I had jewelry here. It was still here.
[Man] You think they were tryin' to look for somethin' on us?
[Flowers]
I think so. I mean, why else? Uh —
[Man] You weren't missin' any — any kind of papers or anything?
[Flowers]
Like what kind of papers?
[Man] Well, I mean, any kind of personal records... or checkbooks or anything like that — phone records?
- [Flowers] Do I have any?
- [Man] Yeah.
- [Flowers] Uh-uh. I mean, why would I?
- [Man] I don't know. I just —
[Flowers] You usually call me, for that matter.
And besides, who would know?
[Man] Uh, but I just think that if everybody's on record denying it... you got no problem.
Hold on just a sec here, people.
- Where'd he go?
- [Reporters Clamoring]
[Female Reporter]
Do you have any comments... about the allegations from Gennifer Flowers and the tape recordings?
She was worried about being assumed to be guilty just because her name was brought in.
I said, "That's not true.
Even if your name gets used, in the absence of proof, nobody can prove you're guilty.
Don't worry about it. Tell the truth. Just tell 'em that you didn't do it." That's all I ever said.
- [Male Reporter] How do you know her?
- See ya.
[Male Reporter]
Thank you, Governor.
[Male Reporter] Did the governor at any time tell you on the telephone... to just tell the truth about what happened?
He told me to just deny it.
[Male Reporter]
Did Governor Clinton use a condom?
- [Reporters Snickering, Laughing]
- Jesus. Right here.
Right here.
Ladies and gentlemen — Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna put this to a stop... if there are any further questions that are degrading, in my opinion, like that.
Now, right here, sir.
[Male Reporter]
You were paid by the Star.
Did anyone ever approach you from the Republican Party — perhaps another Democratic candidate — to urge you to tell this story publicly?
- Yes, they did.
- Who?
- I can't say.
- Wait. You're saying —
Wait, are you saying that somebody from another campaign —
Democratic Party or Republican Party — approached you to tell this story?
Was it the Democratic Party or was it the Republican Party, Ms. Flowers?
It was the Republican Party.
We knew we'd get attacks, but, I mean, you know —
We just couldn't believe the press would pick up a tabloid story that somebody —
I mean, we're at a new low in a way.
That's why it's so important.
But we are fighting back.
Somebody who's been through a lot of tough elections... is James Carville, who's known as the Ragin' Cajun in the business.
- [Scattered Applause]
- We'd like him to say a couple of words to you.
[Carville] Uh, we have a tough fight comin' right down the stretch.
It's gonna come out that Roger Ailes is behind a lot of this stuff before the election... that you been seein' about Governor Clinton.
- Okay? Ailes.
- [Man] Boo!
And of course Bush and Georgette Mosbacher and everything.
Let me tell you what's at stake in this election.
Every time that somebody comes along that's got some ideas — a Democrat comes along — the Republicans come up here and they ambush him.
Remember Muskie?
Okay?
That is standard procedure.
And here comes Clinton.
He comes to New Hampshire.
People here are hurtin'.
They want hope. They want somebody with vision. He gives it to 'em.
So what do Republicans do?
They get together with their wedge issues and they knock it off.
If they succeed this time, it's gonna be every time.
You are never going to get a presidential candidate. Okay?
You're never gonna get somebody to come up here and run for president... that's served 11 years as governor who's got any kind of experience.
Okay? And every time somebody comes up, they're gonna do it.
If we win this, then you have knocked this shit back forever.
- [Applause]
- Okay?
And every time that we get a Democrat that we can believe in...
Roger Ailes a-a-and Georgette Mosbacher —
You know that she's the secretary of the person closest to Bush.
You know what she said?
She can't wait till this election's over so she can get her Maserati and her jewels back.
That's the mind-set you're fightin' against.
And if they beat us back —
Paul Tsongas —
Look, he ain't gonna win anything, okay?
This is not about Paul Tsongas.
It's about George Bush and Roger Ailes and Georgette Mosbacher... and the whole sleazy little cabal of 'em that wanna keep hold of anything... and that wanna knock anybody off that we believe in... and anything that we care about.
And if we beat them and you're out there... and your knuckles get tired or your feet get cold or anything else... you think about that.
Because if they knock us off, then so what?
The next one that comes up, they gonna knock the next one off.
- [Applause, Cheering]
- And the next one and everything else.
And you know what kind of shit you're gonna get?
You're gonna get the kind of Supreme Court that you got.
You're gonna get the kind of four different positions on civil rights that you get from 'em.
You gonna get tax breaks for the wealthy.
You gonna get a guy that doesn't know what a grocery store scanner is. Okay?
So let's go. We got —
You know, we got six more days to go.

[Female Announcer] Some say his campaign appears to slip further every day.
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton remains tight-lipped... about a controversial letter regarding the Vietnam draft.
Ask the president when he gets off the plane... to call the Pentagon and ask how the letter got out.
W-W-Wait a minute.
What do we got here?
What is the Pentagon doing in the middle of a political campaign?
And what is the Pentagon doing leaking something... that we asked for November 6 that they didn't give us?
Now, Governor Clinton has a character problem, but I take it that your line of...
Governor Clinton has no character problem.
He's passed his character test.
Well, I mean, he has not denied that he has engaged in marital infidelity.
He denied a specific one.
- He has said that he had problems in his marriage.
- That's right.
And he has talked about the draft.
And to some people, it's a character problem.
Bill Clinton's passed his character test throughout his life and throughout this campaign.
And he's shown it through his commitments to real fights.
What he's gonna do in this campaign is focus on what's important to the American people — on jobs and education.
That's what the American people care about.
They wanna move into the future.
They don't want to be diverted by side issues... and they're not gonna let the Republican attack machine divert them.
- [Applause]
- I'm getting sick and tired —
I am — every single night... hearing one of these carping little liberal Democrats... jumping all over my you-know-what.
- And I can't wait for this campaign.
- [Applause, Cheering]
The friction in this is gonna be too much for Clinton to survive.
I think it's only really a matter of days before he'll have to get out... if not hours.
- Tell me your name.
- John Bickerstaff.
- John, Hillary Clinton.
- I'm the night baker.
I think if we could just keep one-on-one and one-on-one, energy, energy, energy...
- I think we can make it.

- They do.
Well, it's a lot like home.
Don't you think it is?
- [Woman] I mean, it's what he's gonna do.

That's the bottom line right there.
I don't wanna hear any more of this "read my lips" business.

You're not worried about his big, hardball, negative tactics... that have worked for them for 15 years?

I'm convinced that if they try it, we'll hit 'em back and they'll buckle.
What are we gonna do when George Bush attacks us?
I mean, there's the story of AndrewJackson — was in a duel with a guy, and the guy shot and knocked him down.
The guy started walkin'. He says, "Hold to, sir.
Sit still there for a second. It's my turn."
Why can't we attack George Bush?
Why can't we talk about the lowest economic growth in the last 50 years?
Why can't we talk about there being a political hack as drug czar in this country?
Why can't we talk about the fact that he has done nothin' about education... the environment — the deficit's outta control.
He said "no new taxes."
You can just go —
Why is it that I'm always asked...
"What are we gonna do when George Bush attacks us?"
Why don't you go ask George Bush what's he gonna do when we hold him accountable... for all the wrong that he's done to this country?
A-And you can segue, you know, right into Bush.
The idea is, he reeks of yesterday.
He has the stench of yesterday.
He is so yesterday, if I think of yesterday — if I think of an old calendar —
I think of George Bush's face on it.

Bush more negative — net negative, by about 10... and Perot even fave/un-fave at around 37.
So that represents a good six-point change or more.

I think what we need is some hand-done signs... that show the kind of themes that we want Clinton, you know —
Because hand-done signs are the signs the network will cut to.
If anyone wants to make their own signs, that's fine.
Scott, how many signs can we make between now and tonight?
Can you make 2,000 signs that are —
I am not at all convinced that a bunch of hodgepodge, handheld, homemade signs... are gonna make the impact visually... from both a television point of view and from a podium point of view... that a sea of the same kind of sign across the hall.
May I just add that the problem is that we have two kinds of signs.
We have thin, red signs — white-on-red signs — and then we have rectangular white-on-blue signs.
We have a mixed message out on the floor.
We went through this twice before at two other conventions... and that's basically the problem.
And also, Brown put out new signs last night that were white on red... in which the letters — the white letters — were bigger than our letters.
And so they looked better.
How are we gonna foll —

Now that the Democratic Party has revitalized itself...
I have concluded that we cannot win in November.
[Man]
Perot just pulled out. Out.
[Man #2]
Out. Perot's out.
Unbelievable.
The perception is that Clinton has succeeded... in pushing out one of his chief rivals in the presidential race.
But on the other hand,
Clinton campaign advisers... were counting on Perot to help them, especially in the South.
Perot, with his harsh attacks on President Bush... worked to soften up the incumbent... and that was perceived to be a help to the Democratic candidate.
How's that?
Any kind of political earthquake like this increases the intensity of coverage.
That means people are gonna see Bill Clinton tonight step into the vacuum.
There's only two candidates left in this race.
People are gonna tune in tonight to hear what Bill Clinton has to say.
It's gonna be electric in there tonight.

[Woman] "This time don't read his lips.
Read the record." Yeah.
Whatever. But instead of that, go back one more time and have him say, "Read my lips."
"No, sir.
This time we're reading the record."
[Woman] You can't. I'm just —
We have a time problem.
But that's just it. There's no less time to go back to him and say, "Read my lips."

"Read my lips. No. Read the record."
[Woman]
Um, he takes longer than anybody.
[Carville Groans]
Then cut somewhere else.
Let's get three times of,
"Read my lips."
[Stephanopoulos] Where else can we cut?
"Now he wants you," not "asking you."
"Government spending in Arkansas, the lowest in the nation."
- [Woman] Which three facts?
- We're going with spending.
But in terms of scripts tonight, we're gonna test alternatives —
- one with welfare and one with spending.
- [Woman] Okay.
[Man] I think for recording, we should record the spending one.
Spending has priority.
If welfare's possible as a second shot —
Mandy, here's the way to save maybe a half a second or a second.
- [Mandy] Yeah?
- Under the second announcer... change the sentence to, "Now he wants you to believe what he says about Bill Clinton."
[Mandy]
Actually, what I changed it to was...
"Now he's asking you to believe his attacks against Bill Clinton."
- Fine. Either way. That's better.
- [Man] The other thing we could do, Mandy —
- [Mandy] Yeah.
- Maybe we could say —
Where we say, "No, Mr. President.
This time we're gonna read the facts"... maybe could just say,
"No. This time we're gonna read the facts."
- [Stephanopoulos] Better.
- [Mandy] Yeah.
"No, sir."
Maybe that's a Southern thing, but, "No, sir." "No — No, sir."
"No, sir."
But I just think it's very important we get at the end, we get that "read my lips."
I know that that will drive them — the voters —
It's the most famous broken promise in the history of American politics.
[Mandy] I'm just telling you that in the way it's set up to be factual... and, you know, big facts —
What visual were you thinking of with the fact?

Okay. Let's do that.
But let's just get this spot produced.

I just wanna say one thing. If this —
You need to call Mandy back and tell her to be sure that she gets that "read —"
No. Not with me. To be sure she gets
"read my lips" in three times.
One day, in my time, in my political career —
Every time that you suggest something to a media person... their first reaction is,
"We can't do that."
Every time.
"Well, we can't do that."
It doesn't take you long to get to the second time though.
Yeah. I know. But just one time,
I would just like to say, "Let's do that."
Say, "Fine. That's easy, man.
What do you need? Here it is."
James, this idea was suggested a half hour ago.
Your script has been made in 20 minutes.
- She's in the studio producing it.
- The studio — producing it.
- That's 45 minutes.
- We've gone from a half hour... to a concept to a spot.
- What the fuck do you want?

I suppose we could've gotten on the satellite to get it out in 30 minutes!
You haven't even asked, but it'll probably be at the focus group tonight at 6:00.
And, you know, most campaigns, it takes 'em two days to get a spot out and run it. So okay.
You're right. You're right. Mandy's great.
Mandy's great. She's great.

I am saying it is vintage Clinton... that it is a pathological pattern of deception.

He has said to Frank White in his 1982 race,
"I don't know what he's talking about."
He has said in other races, "Oh, I just attended a few marches to listen to the speeches."
He organized. He marched.
He wrote. He spoke.
According to Father McSorley, he was a main antiwar organizer.
Why doesn't he just say that?
It's like the draft. Why didn't he just say he was trying to avoid the draft?
No one is questioning that. They're questioning why he always prevaricates on these issues.

[Man] I have a question for Mr. Carville.
Did Bill Clinton go to Moscow?
- Are two pages missing from his passport?
- [Laughter]
Did he organize antiwar rallies while he was in Moscow?
- Did he graduate from Oxford?
- [Guests Laughing]
Yes, he went to Moscow. He used to brag about it in speeches when he ran for office.
He went to Warsaw too and, I don't know, Oslo and wherever else.
And yet as a reporter from one of the big papers called me —
"Did he have a transmitter planted in his cavity while he was there?"
Wh-What diff— Why do you ask me a question like that: "Did he go to Moscow?"
What difference does it make?
In 1970, Bill Clinton went to Moscow.
Okay.
An answer!
[Carville] But — What? It does. I mean, he's answered it a thousand times.
He's said that he went.
What — It's irrelevant to the question.
And that's my point.
- What did he do there?
- How the hell do I know what he did in Moscow?
I mean, I don't know what he did.
Maybe — I don't — You know —
[Stammering, Chuckling]
At that time in our nation's history, though —
[Laughing]
Some could have been heavily criticized for going to a country... that was supplying the enemies of the U nited States.
They were doing student exchanges.
We were playin' 'em in basketball, man.
What are you talkin' about?
I mean, come on.
I mean, we had track meets with these people.
The issue here isn't patriotism.
You can demonstrate all you want here at home.
But I can't understand... someone mobilizing demonstrations in a foreign country... when poor kids... drafted out of the ghettos... are dying in a faraway land.
[Announcer Speaking In Portuguese]
- Liz, do you speak Portuguese?
- Let me see if José does.
[Carville] Oh, this is too good.
This is too good.
[Woman] You don't even need to understand Portuguese.
- [Man Speaking Portuguese Continues]
- [Laughs]
[Carville] I mean, if the president don't buy American for his campaign —
Who do we give this to?
Hey, Collier?
Get me Susan Zirinsky's number, please.
♪♪ [Whistling
The Andy Griffith Show Theme]
With CBS.
Susan Zirinsky, please.
James Carville.
[Whistles]
- Huh?
- Who is she?
She's the — She's the woman that Broadcast News was -
- Oh, really?
- Hey.
I got something you might be interested in.
How would you like a videotape of a newscast on Brazilian television... that has —
We believe the script goes something like this... with appropriate visuals of printing presses.
"The Republican campaign..."
Is what?
What it is is that Bush is buyin' up to $10 million in printing in Brazil... and the Brazilian TV ran it.
It's these huge printing presses with Bush-Quayle material coming —
I mean, it's perfect for the news — for television.
Lathered, man. They just can't wait to get the tape. This thing'll —
Did we trans —
We have a translation?
Oh, CBS, they got 100,000 people.
They oughta speak Portuguese.
We have a rough trans —
It's just everything you want.
- You know where we got this?
- Yeah.
[Bush] When it comes to crime,
I just wish that Candidate Clinton... out around the country, the Doberman pinscher... would meet Governor Clinton, the Chihuahua.
[Shrieking Laughter]
[TV Reporter] The president said he thinks there will be a debate, but he couldn't say when... with next week in Louisville, Kentucky now apparently out.
[Whispers, Indistinct]
[Carville] Where's the tape?
Hey, Vicki, put the tape in the thing.
And this is wonderful in the South.
If you listen to the tape... Watch this, y'all.
- [Announcer Speaking In Portuguese]
- [Woman] This is it!
[Man] You thinkJames Lake had anything to do with this?
Yeah, why did he go to Brazil?
I wonder who paid for it.
- [Man] It's James Lake.
- [Stephanopoulos]
Brazil Gate. Rio Gate. Oh, man!
[Staff Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues]
- [Man] He got a very good deal.
Can I just throw a little cold water on this for a minute?
We don't know what the date on the tape is.
They show convention footage.
If these are convention signs —
This aired, and one of our people saw it two weeks ago and made the tape down there.
All right. All I'm saying is, it's possible. Possible.
[Greenberg] But they have pictures of the convention in them.
- Right.
- They just used — They used it.
What is it, poss —
What are you trying —
It's possible that they were printed in primary money.
- Well, that still —
- So what?
[All Talking At Once]
It's a big — You're talking taxpayer funds, and that's what you said —
- No. That ain't —
- You got matching money involved.
You have matching money.
You got matching money. Sure do.
It's a valid technical point, but it's just —
I don't think it's gonna —
[Man] I'd still find out exactly what we're dealing with.
- It's matching money.
- [Chattering]
You're being way, way too —
I will call and get the details.
- Who did the contract?
- Right.
- Do they have a contract?
- Mmm. That's tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- You know the date —
No. Hey. What did Barney Fife say?
"We'll handle it."
[Laughing]
That's tomorrow.
[Laughs]
You see, 'cause tomorrow, who got the contract... and how they did that, what guys have lobbying things in Brazil —
Yeah. There's no sense in this thing being a one-day story.
I don't believe. I think we gotta kinda ooze this thing out a bit.
I'll call and find out... call the source.
It's very sweet.
See about getting an uplink out of São Paulo.
See how hard it is, how many times you gotta hop it to get it up here.
Okay.
And we'll want to downlink this here in Little Rock.
[Whooshes]
This thing, I'm tellin' you —
I like the way this thing feels.
Campaign hard money.
Can we send someone to look and see... if they've sent any checks to this Brazilian company?
- Yeah.
- That —
Okay, this was a — This was aired during the Republican convention —
- So that's pri —
- which means that it was primary money.
- Still government money.
- It's still...
I have a feeling it's R.N.C., is what I've thought all along.
- No, it can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.
- It can't be R.N.C.
- It says Bush/Quayle.
It's illegal.
- Let's hope it's R.N.C.
- The issue's moot.
All we got to do is go out and get the latest filing and see if there's a check.
I think we looked on it earlier.
We didn't find it.
We'll check now with updates.
It's possible it's a subcontract, you know, that —
In fact, it is likely that they've done this through their — maybe it was a media firm... and it was subcontracted through the media firm.
It's unlikely there's a direct check.
No, but somebody said, if you look at the translation... that they went to Ohio and Texas and California.
- Right, but it could be —
- And where they came was Rio.
- All we can do is check —
- [Laughing]
- They came to Rio.
- We gotta respond —
What should be our response to the Brazil thing?
[Greenberg] We're stunned.
We're speechless. We can't respond.
[Laughing]
What's his 60-second spot? What does he say about American jobs in his spot?
What is it?
What do people think about Bush?
He cares more about foreign things, and he cares more about rich people.
- Foreign.
- Yeah.
There's something —
We knew he spent a lot of time overseas.
Now he's spending a lot of taxpayer money over there, or something.
Foreign aid is something — something like that.
We knew he didn't care much about creating American jobs —
No, here it is.
He's finally got a jobs program.
Too bad it's for Rio.
[Chuckling]
[Carville]
Hey, what's the song about Rio?
What rhymes with Rio?
It's better than we even thought.
- The two highest business failures —
- Yeah?
Are New York and California in the piece.
Business failures in the country — leading in New York and California.
The two states they didn't go to for the printing is New York and California.
Goddamn.
Has she said what their reaction is yet?
- I just talked to her.
- Okay. All right.
[Stephanopoulos] It's leading the news, and she's sending me the script.
[Carville]
Okay.
Hey, Governor, how you doing?
All right.
Printing —
Print materials in Brazil.
Pictures of— Yeah.
Yeah. They're gonna lead with it.
All right?
[Chewing Loudly]
Well, let's see what happens on the news.
Yeah, I can call to up there.
Just checked it out.
Every single penny spent in the U.S.
- Ours?
- Yes.
- Is somebody asking?
- Get a quote on that.
Did they ever call you back and say what the Bush reaction was?
Yes. You're gonna —
I called Mary, and she goes,
"Is this bad?"
[Laughing]
"Is this bad?"
I said, "Susan, you better tell her it's pretty bad."
They don't understand.
[Man]
Oh, they will.
If the president of the United States don't know where $65 million... of his campaign money goes... how can you expect to know where
$1.4 trillion of taxpayer monies go?
- Huh? Does that work?
- [Groans]
I think it's better just to say, you know —
Oh, my God, that is —
- [Carville] What's wrong? What's wrong?
- The guy's story is completely incredible.
He says that he did it on his own.
He dumped $40,000 on his own.
- Give me a break.
- Where are the signs then?
That's what she's trying —
The guy won't return her phone call.
- [Phone Dialing]
- Well, when I was talking to her... she said he was on another line and she'd call me back, so let's see.
They're bullshitting you. They —
But — But let me —
Okay. But the link is this —
They have printed materials that were printed in Brazil, okay?
What do they say happened to the materials?
Yeah, but if they can't produce the materials... then they either got 'em or they were given to 'em.
If they were given to 'em, that's a violation of F.E.C. Law.
Call me back. Bye.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a tremendous honor and a privilege... to welcome back to the Ozarks... the president of the United States,
George Bush!
[Cheering]
[TV Continues, Indistinct]
[Carville]
What is the matter today?
Every time somebody farts the word "draft," it's on the front page of the paper.
It's not! Okay.
I'm gonna see how many stories there are on the draft... and how many stories there are on
George Bush's election year promises.
Okay?
Oh... Oh, oh, oh, oh!
A lot more. A lot more.
Okay. I'm gonna go back and see.
You know, George Bush mentioned the draft one time.
He mentioned it one time... and let's see how many stories that was written on the draft.
Oh, okay. Well, you said if you wanna say something, then say something.
I'm giving you an example of there's a lot more fascination... with the quote, "draft issue," unquote, or Gennifer Flowers... than there is with George Bush promising $16 zillion more... than he could ever spend in an election year.
I believe that on any number of things... that we are held to a different standard.
I think it is absolutely ludicrous... that no one ever asked George Bush about Iran-Contra.
Two cabinet secretaries saying Bush was lying.
No one ever said a damn thing.
You get this memo from Baker... about him knowing about — about Iraq having chemical weapons going.
And then there's no follow-up because,
God, you can't askJim Baker a question.
This man is down deep —
He's beyond being questioned.
He gives everybody tickets to the opera.
We can't question him.
You know?
This is not directed any more at the Washington Post.
I've had this conversation with everybody today.
You know, I am so goddamn tired... of this goddamn double standard... where the press lets these sons of bitches get away with murder... and every little thing that we do —
"Clinton's numbers don't add up!
Clinton's numbers don't add up!"
- That is so fucking true.
- You know?
It's so unbelievable.
If we say 50 plus 50 is 104, and they say 50 plus 50 is 104,000... they'll say, "Well, both of them are stretching their numbers a little bit."
- Hello? Yeah.
- [Laughs] Exactly.
Oh, the goddamn stories.
They're not going with the story.
The printing... The —
Printing the, uh —
Shit, you know.
[Carville] I think that they've given up on it now, Governor.
The Bush people said they got the guy wired, said, "Well, I just did it.
It was an offshore operation," you know?
So they're trying to nail him. So it's not dead, but it's just not going tonight.
[Woman On TV In Background, Indistinct]
That the guy just did it himself and he just spent the money himself... and they never authorized it.
Okay. Give me a call later, okay?
All right.
This morning Perot was on
CBS Morning News... claimed that he made a mistake by getting out of the race.
Perot volunteer army, despite the disconnection of the 800 number... was supplied with four million dollars in August.
He noted they're gaining some strength and confidence... thanks to his repeated hints about becoming an official candidate.
We lost some Perot people who went back over to the other side in a couple different states.
Um, on the creative chicken side...
- chicken tried to get into a Bush event today...
- [Laughing]
And he had a sign that said
"Poultry workers for Bush."
Got inside, flipped it. It said,
"Chicken George won't debate."

Good night.
And, yes, I want a debate.
I want a debate over issues and an argument over ideas... and I will stand on my record... and I won't let that Arkansas governor run away from his record either.
[Cheering]
[Carville]
Can you believe this shit?
You know, I mean, I just think that they're into this...
"We're the president" motif.
Hello? Yeah.
Well, no. Bush rejected the thing, so there ain't no position to have.
There's no debate.
- Yeah!
- [Chattering, Indistinct]
I'm wondering if there's gonna be a huge story... that they rejected to even meet with the commission.
It's another date certain.
Another debate that goes by.
Let's just get it out right away. If you can get it out tonight, it would be the best.
'Cause it'll be in the papers in the morning.
Yeah. I mean, so —
[Stammers]
Yeah, so tell them —

10 minutes tomorrow just to... pop.

Well, you're going to hear an awful lot of spinning.
One of those who will be doing some serious spinning from the right... is Mary Matalin... the deputy campaign manager for the Bush/Quayle campaign.
Ms. Matalin, let's talk about first the polls.
They are behind in the polls.
There's no way to deny that.
What is George Bush going to say tonight... that hopefully, in his case, will turn things around?

Well, I think Mary Matalin's got a good career in fiction writing when this is over.

Okay, y'all — you never want to talk about the deficit.
It's a crazy aunt in the basement.
We're gonna go down that basement... clean her out, sweep her out and whack her around a little bit... knock the bitch around.
The problem is, when you get under that hood... some son of a bitch in Washington slams that hood right down on you.
Hurts like hell.

♪ How about cookin' somethin' up with me? ♪
These have turned into real shows, you know that?
Gettin' better.
The first thing is that since there are four debates... the first one is incredibly important.
And we want to establish ourselves as the folks that the press can trust... or they'll either go to their own research departments... which are pretty incompetent, or they'll come to the campaign.
So the less political sounding our responses are, the better.
George and James and Bruce will have to be in there spinning immediately afterwards.
Right.
So as we always say, you know, speed kills... and we will die in this debate if we're not there first with our answers.
- Where's Clinton going?
- [Moderator]
Governor Clinton, one minute, sir.
[Clinton] The mistake that was made was making the "read my lips" promise... in the first place just to get elected...
- knowing what the size of the deficit was.
- [Applause]
[Stephanopoulos]
Yes!
[Carville]
Perfect. Perfect.
You just can't promise something like that just to get elected... if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.
[Moderator] All right.
Mr. Perot, the question is for you.
Perfect. Oh, yes. I love this.
In terms of being influenced by women and being a minority... there they are right out there — my wife and my four beautiful daughters.
- And I just have one son —
- [Carville] He lost — Uh-oh.
- So he and I are surrounded by women —
- Oh, wow.
Giving us — telling us what to do all the time.
- [Man] What?

- I want to make a very brief comment here, uh... in terms of Saddam Hussein.
Look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what have you.
And look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said... at the end when they were trying to clean it up.
- We can't be this lucky.
- [Laughing]
This don't happen to me, man.
This don't happen to me.
Bush was on the defensive.
Bush was on the defensive.
Keep repeating "Bush was on the defensive" all night.
Okay. He was.
Hell, he was on the ropes.
- Which way we going?
- This way.
- Whoo!
- Let's go!
Whoo!
Let's go. Roll.
- Heads up!

Little news!
Where's the —
Where are we supposed to be goin', Vicki?
We gotta find out what Bush said.
Jeff, do you have a walkie-talkie?
[Man]
Be careful.
I gotta find out what Bush said.
We're ready.
Talk to Jerry real quick?
Do you mind?
What did Bush say in the last second after Clinton did Baker?
He said, "That's what worries me."
Clinton said — the economic policy.
- Quick, before we, um —
- [Chattering]
Another good night for Bill Clinton.
Three debates, three wins.
Bush was on the defensive all night long.
I think he was put on the defensive by Bill Clinton over the economy... and by Ross Perot over Saddam Hussein... and Ross Perot over the mess in Washington, and he couldn't get out of it.
It's the record. It's the agenda.
It's the qualifications.
Governor Clinton and the Democrats don't like when we talk about character... but 54 of them thought character was a very big issue... when they rejected President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense... citing character insufficiencies because he flirted with women in elevators.
There's no doubt that George Bush's attacks on us have an effect.
The effect they're having is on George Bush.
Negative.
See?
They're working against Bush.
[Man]
They have no effect on your campaign?
Again now, don't take my word for it.
Look at every poll that you see.
This is not a sports event.
People don't get out their peanuts and hot dogs and rate these things.
They want to know —
Focus on the choice between these candidates and their philosophies.
And we have tried to do that in each debate.
We're not trying to create drama.
We are not a made-for-TV candidate.
Yes, Governor Clinton won on Geraldo-like activities.
That's his shtick.
He's a performer. He's a phony.
I mean, he walks into the audience.
He puts Geraldo to shame.
That's not our gig. We are a leader.
We are mature.
We have a breadth and depth of experience that's unrivaled on that stage... and that's all we've ever tried to do... and have been very successful in each of these debates doing... and you'll all be eating crow, because that's how the American voters look at this.
They don't need another Geraldo.
They need a leader in the White House.
- Here's ABC.
- Great.
Oh, Perot came in second, not Bush.
Hey, Trish, are you sure about this?
I heard Bush was second.
I hope it was Perot.
I just got it from —
I just got it from Ricki.
Great.
[Trish] CBS is something like 35, Clinton,
29, Perot, and then the balance is Bush.
I'm going to double-check that one.
- Bush came in third in both.
- As far as I know.
- One-third undecided, one-third weak.
- Right.
- That constitutes about 18% of the electorate.
- What was the other one-third?
Two-thirds were weak Clinton, and one-third undecided.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?
So in terms of our universe of folks, that was a strong showing for Perot.
[Applause, Cheering]
[Clinton]
James, thank you.
Thank you, Governor.
That was a pretty good little —
- [Woman] He's counting speaking fees.
- Kodak memories.

I mean, you had your chance.

But do it on every issue.

And we want to close on our theme song.
Let's hit it, Ed.
- [Man] ♪ We're crazy ♪
- [Cheering]
♪ Crazy for feelin' so ♪
[Male Reporter]
It was a very different kind of rally... ending a very different kind of campaign.
♪ We're crazy ♪
It's a campaign that cost at least $60 million.
[All Laughing]
[Reporter Continues, Indistinct]
[Carville] It is the most expensive single act of masturbation in the history of the world.
[All Laughing]
[Female Reporter] His voice almost gone,
Hillary Clinton has been pitching in.
[Hillary Clinton] We'll have to be real quiet to be able to hear him.
If you will be my voice tomorrow,
I'll be yours for four years.
[Cheering]
I thought of that, didn't I?
I'll take credit for it.
Steve Denari, who's the director of the I llinois Perot office... and he wants to talk to someone confidentially.
[Hums]
Read it to me.
Well, what does names, addresses —
I can send you a fax with names, addresses, phone numbers of who you had an affair with.
It wouldn't make it true.
Yeah, I just — Believe me —
[Carville I n Background] No, he wasn't, but I'm just gonna tell the son of a bitch —
Believe me that it's been looked at by every major national news organization.
Everything.
And it is completely bullshit.
If you went on the radio... and said that Bill Clinton is the father of an illegitimate black child... you would be laughed at.
People would think you're crazy.
[Carville Chattering]
We're not gonna lose.
We are gonna win.
He is gonna be president.
Well, no, but, I mean —
Don't think of it like that.
Let's take it at two levels.
Number one, of course it's not gonna matter.
But number two, think of yourself.
I guarantee you that if you do this... you'll never work in Democratic politics again.
Maybe you don't want to.
I'm not saying it matters.
You will be embarrassed before the national press corps.
People will think —
Nobody will believe you... and people will think you're scummy.
The alternative is you don't do it.
It causes you some temporary pain... with people who tomorrow aren't gonna matter... and you have a campaign that understands... that in a difficult time you did something right.
Um, and, you know, that's important.
I mean, it doesn't mean anything... and we can't do anything for you specifically or anything like that... but you know that you did the right thing... and that you didn't, um... dishonor yourself.
[Chattering, Shouting]
Oh, my God!
[Stephanopoulos]
Um, and finally, before I give him the floor... for what I hope isn't the last time... uh, I think we all know that, um... besides Bill Clinton, one person really gave this campaign focus.
And one person wrote what I call a haiku —
[Scattered Laughter]
About five months ago:
Change versus more of the same.
The economy, stupid.
I think if you did a Nexis, it would come up in about a thousand places.
- [All Laughing]
- And don't forget health care.
Um, you know,
I was kidding James yesterday.
I said he was about to pass... from a role of regular human being into the role of a legend.
[Murmuring, Chuckling]
And I think he really deserves it... because probably for the first time in a generation tomorrow... we're gonna win.
And that means that more people are gonna have better jobs.
People are gonna pay a little less for health care, get better care... and more kids are gonna go to better schools.
Um, and so, thanks.
[Cheering]
[Cheering Continues]
There's a simple doctrine.
Outside of a person's love... the most sacred thing that they can give is their labor.
And somehow or another along the way, we tend to forget that.
And labor is a very precious thing that you have.
And any time that you can combine labor with love... you've made a merger.
And I think we're gonna win tomorrow... and I think that the governor is gonna fulfill his promise and change America... and I think many of you are gonna go on and help him.
I'm a political professional.
That's what I do for a living.
I'm proud of it.
We changed the way campaigns are run.
[Camera Shutter Clicks]
Used to be there was a hierarchy.
If you were on one floor, you didn't go to another floor.
If you were somewhere on the organizational chart... there was no room for you there.
Everybody was compartmentalized.
And you people showed that you could be trusted.
Everybody in this room. Everybody.
And people are gonna tell you you're lucky.
You're not.
Ben Hogan said, "Golf is a game of luck.
The more I practice, the luckier I get."
[Laughing]
The harder you work, the luckier you are.
I was 33 years old before I ever went to Washington or New York.
I was 42 before I won my first campaign.
And I'm happy for all of y'all.
You've been part of something special in my life.
[Camera Shutter Clicks]
And I'll never forget what y'all have done.
Thank you.

[Man Chattering, Indistinct]
- Well, come on. Let's put him on speaker.
- That's it, yeah.
Hey, your ugly friend wants to say hello.
Paulie?
[Man]
Hey, Bob.
- How are you, man?
- What's going on?
You pretty tired?
Pretty tired. Um —
But just, you know, when you get up there, and he says this is the last rally... or the last chance or whatever it was that he says —
- Shakes you up, right?
- Huh?
Shakes you up.
It was pretty hard, yeah.
I was pretty shaken up.
Paulie, I got up this morning.
As I was driving to work, I started to cry.
I couldn't keep it — I just can't —
I can't cope right now.
Right.
Man, I'm scared.
Because we're all gonna have to jump off a bridge.
Because, you know —
Because of the last two days.
Because of the last two days.
Yeah.
You know, it's kind of a mass thing.
We can all just drink some Kool-Aid.
Okay, man. Have a good flight.
See you when you get in.
Bye.
Hey, it's James.
What do you think?
[Woman On TV]
Dan Quayle came home to Indiana... where he has never lost a race.
You think it's gonna be tight in NewJersey?
Why was everybody else so optimistic earlier?
[Man] What was that mumbling about seven points?
Oh, CBS. We dropped overnight.
So now they're figuring out how we can lose.
- [Stephanopoulos Laughing]
- [Laughing, Scoffs]
I'm on the floor.
I'm literally on the floor.
I can't take it.
[Sighs]
[Stephanopoulos]
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We tried hard.
We came up a little short.
- To those who embraced our crusade —
- [Stephanopoulos Laughs] Oh, God!
We say thank you.
To President Bush, who's won reelection, we offer our full support...
[Stephanopoulos]
Oh, God.
- Our prayers and our hopes for a better America.
- Shut up.
Throughout this campaign,
I've endeavored... to bring my message of change to the American people.
[Bob] Where's Derek Humphry when you need him?
[Carville] And over 42% of you people embraced that message.
- I am grateful to each and every one of you.
- Are we in favor of assisted suicide?
Hillary and I and Chelsea will never forget you... the way you welcomed us into your homes, your towns and your cities.
- [Chattering, Laughing]
- It is not that we... have lost this battle, it is whether we endure in a larger war.
[Laughing]
In a stunning come-from-behind upset that shocked pundits... political professionals, journalists, people around the world...
- George Herbert Walker Bush —
- Was reelected today.
Proved his political resiliency beyond any doubt whatsoever... and was reelected today over Bill Clinton...
[Phone Ringing]
Garnering 274 electoral votes, only four over.
But as they say, it's not horseshoes and it's not hand grenades.
And George Bush will return —
We repeat, George Bush will return to the White House for another four years.
- [Man] And what's the other one?
- Florida is now 42, Bush, 41.5, Clinton.
- That's what we're getting, so —
- It's started then.
- [All Talking At Once]
- You know what that means.
Uh —
Popkin talked to Warren, whatever, the head of V.R. S... and he's gonna talk to him in four minutes, but his initial impression is it's a landslide.
Could be up to 12, maybe 400 electoral votes.
[Laughs]
- What's this?
- We'll wait and see.
- Holy shit.
- What's this? Is this the new one?
Arkansas.
Connecticut's fine.
- Delaware's fine. Georgia's good.
- Georg —
- Wait, wait, wait. Georgia, fine.
- Georgia's good.
Iowa's done.
- Illinois is done.
- Illinois is a blowout.
- [Both] Indiana, we're ahead.
- [Woman] Indiana?
- Kentucky —
- Kentucky is five.
- Michigan is 11. New York's done.
- Holy shit. We're pulling away in Ohio.
- Oklahoma, we're up.
- Tied in Texas.
Tied in Texas.
It looks good.
Now let's just say that...
I like the text here.
Can you beep Wendy, please?
- Oh, you got it.
- [Whistles]
Looks pretty good.
Look at — Look at Indiana.
Wait, wait.
- Look at Indiana, 42-40.
- I know.
It doesn't matter if we win.
Those people are gonna shit. Oh, excuse me.
[Stammers] In the White House, how would you like to be —
[Whispering, Indistinct]
- [Whispering, Indistinct]
- Look at Texas. Go down to Texas.
- Even.
- Yeah, 39-39.
[Whispering, Indistinct]
- Perot's kind of holding, isn't he?
- [Stephanopoulos] He held.
Yeah, he held. His numbers held.
- I'm sort of surprised, frankly.
- This could be a landslide.
Probably don't have anything yet.
Let me — I gotta call Zell.
[Laughs]
[Stephanopoulos]
Goddamn.
- [Woman, Indistinct]
- We up?
- Up seven.
- Oh.
[Stephanopoulos]
This is very raw though.
[Man]
You know what? Huh?
- [Stephanopoulos] Hello?
- Nothing.
Is the governor there?
Um, well, if he wants to call, tell him things look, um, outstanding.
Really good.
[Carville]
Are you kidding me?
It's gotta be 10. Okay.
- [Chattering]
- [Phone Ringing]
[Chattering, I ndistinct]
[Ringing Continues]
[Carville]
We don't have Louisiana anywhere?
[Man]
Okay.
[Second Phone Ringing]
[Carville] Well, who's got —
You don't have them all on your computer?
- This all tracks.
- Yeah.
But if I call you at 3:00 my time... you can look in your computer and we can know everything.
Like, when I try to say it, it's gonna be hard.
I don't know. What do you say?
Mr. President-Elect?
I think you gotta say Mr. — I assume you just gotta say Mr. President.
You say, "Congratulations,
Mr. President."
That's weird.
This is the latest numbers at 2:00, okay?
California, we're up by 19.
Boxer's gonna win.
Colorado, we're up by 10.
[Ringing]
How long does he intend to talk?
This sounds like an awful long speech.
[Man]
Oh, yeah. It'll be an hour or two.
[Laughing]
[Greenberg] Can we go to the party before he finishes?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, let me just run through this.
- I think this is a pretty good structure.
- [Stephanopoulos] Okay.
Third, which is the real take-home point... and I really sold on them, which is this won't happen overnight.
- Yeah, we gotta do that.
- That's the most important point to make.
Yeah, I want a cold beer.
What kind of special today?
Well, the special today is pepperoni and black olive.
And also we've got that 50-cent draft
Busch beer, if you want that.
- [Laughing]
- No, I don't want Busch beer.
Give me the —
Shit, I ain't drinking no Busch beer.
Give me a Budweiser.
- [Laughing]
- Bud. And what would you like to eat?
Huh? I need a beer quickly.
Quickly, quickly.
No Busch beer.
Landslide.
[Laughing]
[Cheering]
Pennsylvania!
The governor walks out — or president.
[Chuckles]
God, I get shook up when I say it.
Walks out with Hillary and Chelsea.
They wave, they smile, they hug.
The Gores —
He then introduces the Gores.
They wave, they smile, they hug.
The Gores go sit down.
Hillary and Chelsea go sit down.
Governor gives his speech.
I can't imagine the headlines tomorrow.
I'm sorry?
The headlines tomorrow are gonna be —
We need — In that section, you've gotta add a sentence about the young people.
- And it would be nice to have the 83-year-old —
- What section?
This section here.
It's gotta be something specifically about how young people voted...
- in record numbers and changed —
- In record numbers. With record enthusiasm.
Their generation's gonna come —
It should come after the 83-year-old woman.
See if we can find a story in the catalog with a young person.
[Exhales]
We gotta get him something real soon.
These changes have to be made quickly.
We gotta get it right out to him.
- How do I get it to him?
- We'll take care of it.
You like "everything" better than "the country"?
[Man]
I'm sorry?
Do you like, "Together we can make the country and love everything it was meant to be"... better than "Together we can make the country and love the country it was meant to be"?
That implies an inadequacy with the country, doesn't it? The latter formulation?
Mm-hmm.
That's nice. That's real nice.
So just make that one change and get it back.
Yes.
- [Man On TV]... in Massachusetts.
- [Cheering]
- Thank you. Massachusetts.
- [Applause]

Thank you very much.
And now we've really got to do something.
Great. Bye-bye.
[Mutters]
- [Man] Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Congratulations.
[Stephanopoulos Exhales]
- [Man] What, um —
- How do you feel?
It's still not — You know, it's getting —
I mean, I was pretty shook up talking to him.
[Man]
What did he say?
They were giddy. It's like it didn't —
I mean, they're just like —
Are you, like, happy or are you scared... or are you nothing or do you want to just, like, cry or what?
The crying was before.
Maybe it'll be later too.
No, it's just like... floating.
- James.
- What?
- On your chest in front of you —
- This one?
Your white one is totally unnecessary because that beige one in your hand —
Okay. This is the everywhere pass?
That is a very exclusive... There are only about five of those in existence.
- Okay.
- And it gets you backstage with the governor.
- Where am I supposed to meet them? What room?
- There are only about five.
- I-I-I —
- You don't know?
In the director's office of the State House.
But it's almost impossible to get there because there are so many... tens of thousands of people out on the street.
I'll meet you out here.
I'm just going to use the ladies' room.
[Carville] We don't know how we're gonna get there through the crowd.
♪♪ [Rock: Man Singing]
- [Carville] Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm very proud to have done this.
I'm as happy as I can be and I'm so proud.
We won Nevada big.
Governor, we're gonna —
I mean, it's looking like close to 400.
It's a landslide.
Ohio's not called yet.
North Carolina's not called yet.
But everything else —
I mean, Michigan —
Dead even in Florida.
You know, it's just unbelievable.
You oughta be the —
I mean, the happiest man in the world.
And I just gotta tell you,
I just appreciate this so much.
This was the best thing I ever did.
We can try. He's up there talking now though, you know.
He's up there giving his speech. Yep.
You don't?
But the one thing you gotta be —
We really want you to say whatever you want to say tonight... but you just gotta be careful about being too programmatic.
You should definitely be New Democrat, and we love Hillary's new patriotism thing... which he tried to put in there.
Also you gotta do at the end, he goes back to the announcement speech... which is very important.
But you know, just say what —
Speak from your heart tonight.
I mean, that's all that matters.
Say what you want to say.
I mean, this is your night.
Okay. We'll see you in a little bit.
Bye-bye.
- He's like —
- What, is he gone?
He's asking...
"I think we got Nevada!"
[All Laughing]
- Follow Richard.
- [Chattering]
- Follow Richard.
- Okay, Richard knows where he's going here.
He's pretty pumped.
I mean, it's unbelievable.
- He should be.

What did he say when you said
"Mr. President"?
- He said, "Thanks."
- He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

If anyone does not know this place:
It is the Kingdom of Ling, the centre of the world.
If anyone does not know me:
I am Ma Nene Karmo.
I live in the blue turquoise palace in the divine paradise.
You appeared in this world where there is so much sorrow and hate.
The people hunt the animals.
They kill and eat them.
The people catch the fish with iron hooks.
When you destroyyour enemies, the gods and Padmasambhava take them to the Kingdom of Heaven.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, always feel compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
Brahma also always feels compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
You have to subjugate the 1 8 kingdoms ofthe demons and all their other domains
Collect the treasures for Ling and spread the teachings of Buddha.
You must go to the underworld.
When you get there, beware of the boar-headed and the dog-headed spirits.
Furthermore, you will also find the cold hell and the hot hell there.
There, too, is a bottomless river.
Onlyyou and your horse can cross this river.
Midshung, Drugmo and Pekar Lhatse are personifications of the goddess Tara.
They appear in the world to save the living creatures.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, work in the upperworld of the gods, in the middle world of Ngen, in the lower world of the water spirits.
I work forthem all and do not remain idle.
You, too, must be active.
Do not stay here long.
Go to the underworld to save the living creatures.
You must pass judgement on what is good and what is bad.
Follow the white light and go to the underworld.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
In this way Ma Nene Karmo sang about the work of Drugmo in theworld, about King Gesar's descent into hell and about his horse.
From the victorious golden throne
King Gesar, the heavenly ruler, the earth's tree of life, looked upon the assembly with loving and watchful eyes.
All the fathers and mothers, sons and daughters of Ling offered their adoration and good wishes to the King.
Theyjoyfully sang old songs and performed propitious dances.
They drank tea and barley beer in a festive mood.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
Is the 24th a Friday?.
It is a Friday!.
All right then.
On that daywe bring burnt offerings.
Yes, burnt offerings and prayers.
Margen, is Monday your neutral day?.
Yes.
Is Monday a good day?.
Yes, it is a lucky as well as a neutral day.
Then let's set out on Monday!.
It's the right time ifit's a neutral day.
A neutral day is good!
Yes, it is.
Leave on Monday and celebrate the preparation feast on Friday?.
Yes, dear, that's what we'll do.
Friday is Margen's most favourable day.
And the element water is available twice over.
It is an excellent day for the preparation.
Yes, my dear.
Let us also play equestrian games, so that all the lucky signs agree.
Zopon's horse will have to show what it can do.
That remains to be seen!
Kiang or these two horses will win!
Kiang must do his best; ifhe loses, he's lost his chance!
Ifhe loses, he is finished.
But we are betting on him.
...Nextyear at this same time, maywe all bejoyfully reunited.
Maythere be peace in theworld.
May all beings know of Buddha's teachings.
May all the tutelary gods protect us.
May H.H. the Dalai Lama live long and maywe soon meet him...
This is our salt.
That's what our 4 men are going to bring from Lake Tsentso this year.
I don't know ifwe'll find salt there.
They say there are many salt lakes.
Lorries collect the salt mostly from other lakes, butyak caravans go to Lake Tsentso.
Whoever has been to Lake Tsentso will go there again.
We exchange salt for grain.
This year the price of salt is very low.
So we have to keep it for the time being.
Ifthe price goes up, it's good for us.
Ifit stays low, we can't do anything.
It isn't easy to keepyaks.
Fetching salt with yaks is hard work, and then the price for the salt in no way pays us for our effort.
When the salt was worth more, we would exchange it for barley.
But nowadays the value has gone down.
So we have to sell ouryaks to get barley.
Without salt we nomads have no barley either.
Is the Gomshe family sending fouryaks?.
No, threeyaks.
Then we have a total of 1 60 yaks,
40 yaks per man?.
-Three from you?.
-Yes, three.
And 21, that makes 1 60 yaks altogether!
Who is the sheep from?.
It's from Margen.
Margen - The Old Mother
I have a lot of experience because I've been fetching salt for manyyears.
So I can show the others the way and explain to them how it's done.
And besides, I'm the oldest.
Ifwe're in a hurry,
I quickly make some simple tea.
But ifwe have time,
I make real strong butter tea and we have a rest.
That's Margen's work.
I was Margen for manyyears, and they all want me as Margen again.
Margen wishes you all good luck!
Thank you for your wishes, all the best!
Pargen - The Old Father
Is it already 4 o'clock?.
Ifit's alreadyfour, we can gradually start the horse racing.
Yes, we'll soon go outside.
Pargen's best wishes for all of you!
We thankyou foryourwishes. Good luck!
Bopsa is the favourite son ofthe salt men, so they say anyway.
Ah yes.
The favourite son??!.
Oyes, each one of us has a position.
Yes, you each have your position.
One is the Old Mother, one the Old Father and one is Lord of the Animals and one the novice!
Zopon - The Lord of the Animals
The Lord of the Animals wishes good luck!
Thankyou.
Long life and success!
Dear Bopsa, have another!
You're like our only son.
Bopsa - The Novice
Bopsa wishes you all good luck!
Yes, thankyou!
Bopsa's nose quivers when he drinks!
They say that in the olden days a woman once went to the salt lake to get salt.
She was so greedy that she took an awful lot of salt and stuffed it all into her trousers.
That upset the salt lake and made it angry.
Since then women are no longer allowed to go to the salt lake.
That's what people say.
There is a salt language.
But the salt men say that they aren't allowed to use this language in the presence of women.
Women don't go to the salt lake, they aren't allowed to.
I don't know why.
In all my more than 70 years I have never heard ofa woman fetching salt.
There must be some reason for it.
Women don't even turn their faces in that direction.
When my son goes to the salt lake as Lord ofthe Animals I worry a bit about him catching a cold and about other small things.
Otherwise I'm notworried because he really is strong enough and can go on the journey.
People say ifa woman goes to the salt lake the salt disappears, women don't get it.
The reason for this may be because women are different from birth, they are different from men.
The first time I was Bopsa it wasn't very difficult because I had an older man at my side.
That time we went to Lake Biru.
Later on we nearly always went to Tsentso, where my grandson goes now. But there we usually had trouble because ofthe mud.
With the heavy salt sacks on our backs we often sank deep into the muddy ground.
It was hard work.
I and Derma, we fight as equals for the Kingdom Ling.
This has been determined by the gods.
We must ride toJang and take possession of the twelve precious salt lakes.
It is time now to conquer the eighty demonic warriors ofJang.
Margen means that I prepare tea and other things for all of us, as a mother does for her family.
Pargen stands for father.
Pargen and Margen take on the roles offather and mother.
Pargen's jobs are to make burnt offerings, to distribute the meat, to prepare the dumpling soup, and if something has to be discussed, to go to other tents.
There is an old story about the different kinds ofwood:
One day the woods spoke to each other about having to go into the fire ofthe salt men the next day.
All the woods said:
I don't want to go,
I don't want to,
I don't want to go!
But then one wood called Wodu came forward and said:
I shall go by hiding myself under the ground.
Wodu wood is yellowish and only grows under the ground.
When it rains it is difficult to find dung to make a firewith.
But luckily it hardly ever rains at this time of the year.
The journey to Tsentso takes a month and a day or two more.
Ifwewalkfast, it takes just a month.
In the past we used to meet other people almost every day, but nowadays far fewer people live here.
Many days we don't meet even a single soul.
There used to be many tents and many herds.
We even had the problem ofthe animals getting mixed up, so that we kept having to look for them.
Once we get beyond the 'stone goat' behind the pass, we have to start following the rules.
They must be obeyed as from this point.
Even when we are sitting in the tent, each one of us has to take up the right position.
And we are by no means allowed to use bad words.
After passing the "stone goat" we also speak the salt language.
Whateverwe do now, we must obey the rules.
It's the first time for Bopsa.
He's a novice here and is initiated into it like a monk who is entering a monastery.
That's why he also brings us butter and tea as presents.
Everything is new to Bopsa, so we older ones have to show him everything for him to learn.
Today is the day that he is admitted to our community.
As from the Bopsa ceremony he will really belong to the salt men.
We call him Bopsa because there are many things he still can't do.
Whatever he does, he lacks experience.
Nothing works without experience,
Iike this he won't achieve anything.
At the salt lake he has to learn how to extract salt, how deep you're allowed to scrape, how to handle the tools, all kinds oftricks.
And how to carry the sacks, but here it depends on whether he is strong enough.
May the gods be with us on the way there and receive us on the way back.
Hail to the gods and the water spirits.
Protect us from all evil!
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods, enemyvanquishers, local gods, the lord ofthe area and all his servants, may they all come and accept the burnt offerings and ablutions.
The gods ofwisdom, the gods ofactivity, the gods of magic power, the Lamas and Tantrics, the earthly tutelary deities, the wish-fulfilling gods ofthe treasure,
Jambhala with all his servants, maythey all accept the offering and make riches fall upon us like rain.
Whereveryou gods appear, may mywishes be fulfilled, obstacles be overcome, illnesses be cured and all negative influences be kept away from me.
May the banners ofbliss rise in all ten directions.
May the lords of the areas, the water spirits, the Ngen, the gods ofthe country, the local gods with their servants, who live in all worlds and in this place, appear and accept the offering.
May the Lamas ofthe three bodies, the Lamas of the three traditions, the peaceful and wrathful deities, the three jewels, the sacrificial goddesses, the gods and guardians of the treasure and all higher creatures accept the pure alcohol offering and fulfil mywishes.
The Earth, the flowers and plants on it, the four continents and Mount Meru, adorned with the sun and the moon,
I shall take them to Buddha as an offering.
May all living creatures be reincarnated in the perfect world.
Good fortune and blessing!
May all you do be successful!
With other salt men we speak only the salt language.
If e.g. at the salt lake someone from our tent meets someone from the neighbouring tent, they speak the salt language.
Anyone who can't speak the salt language isn't respected, especially ifit is an older man.
One thinks badly of someone like that.
The salt language is the salt men's secret language.
When we meet non-nomads we don't use a single word of it.
And especially when women are there we keep the salt language absolutely secret.
We've got that from our forefathers.
That's all I know.
The caravan consists of two parts.
We call the front one Bobyak.
It goes on ahead with the luggage and takes it to the next camp.
The remaining yaks are led by the Lord ofthe Animals to good pastures where he lets them graze in peace.
Where there isn't good grass, he makes them walk faster.
The Bobyak has to be exchanged every day because some ofthese yaks get weak from carrying loads.
That's whywe exchange them and let the others do the carrying.
Where there is good grass
I let the animals walk slowly, and where there is little grass
I drive them a bit.
While the other men go on ahead to the next camp,
I look after the animals.
I make myself some tea, that's all.
In the evening I try to reach the camp with the animals.
At the salt lake, when the others have finished preparing the salt, they send me a message to bring theyaks.
As soon as I get there
I check the saddles and yak carpets.
That's myjob as Zopon, as Lord ofthe Animals.
Doyou live down there?.
Yes, I live down there.
Down there?.
Yes, there.
-You're called Kunga?.
-Yes.
-Would you like some snuff?.
-No.
Was there a lot of snow here this year?.
Not so much,just a little.
But it snowed more back there?.
Yes, there was more snow there.
Was there less here than lastyear?.
Yes. Normallywe have to move...
Doyou?.
...so the animals can survive.
In that case the grass must be better than lastyear?.
Yes, there's more grass here this year.
So that's whyyou didn't move!
This yak has been ill since last night.
It has a twisting ofthe intestines.
It hasn't been well for a few days.
We need somebodywho knows something about this illness.
I don't know how to go about it.
When there isn't enough grass, the animals eat sand.
That's why this has happened.
There's no good grass here.
The other three have gone to look for theyak herd.
But they still aren't backyet, they've been a long time.
We have to find somebody who can help us with theyak!
I'm afraid it will die.
It has to have an operation!
Ifwe have it operated on,
I hope it will survive!
What are we to do with this poor little yak?.
-How are you?.
-Fine.
So we meet after all.
Pardon?.
I thought you wouldn't go to Lake Tsentso this year.
I'm away a lot these days.
Yes.
Yes, then...
You look younger every year.
-Really!?.
-Yes, you do.
Myyaks called Drawu, Rokpu,
Jawu, Zagur, Bandung...
I have lost them all and still haven't found them.
They disappeared in December, still no trace ofthem.
If there really is salt in LakeTsentso, that's good for us.
That's good for you people.
But we can't fetch the salt
Iike the lorries do.
And who knows how deep the mud is?.
It's better than it used to be.
I hope so.
What am I to do?.
I think it's better if the yak has an operation now that we're here at the doctor's.
And then we also need time for the preparations and rituals.
It goes nyok-nyok!
It has already burst.
Already burst!?.
Really!?.
Come here and listen!
Why cause even more suffering?.
An operation is useless and nothing but unnecessary pain.
Come here, come here.
Burst!
Nothing more can be done.
Why kill, when it isn't necessary?.
We people of the land of Dharma don't kill any animals if it isn't necessary.
The animal will die anyway, why cause it additional suffering?.
I promised the salt men that if the yak dies, I'll pay them 200 yuan.
The meat will be eaten.
We shall use it, we don't throw it away.
For me and my people, salt is our life.
Like this time, those people who sent their animals along with us, they also expect us to bring salt back with us when we return.
Therefore we have to do our best.
It's just as the proverb says:
Until victory is won, you have to strive for it.
We have to fight until we've reached our goal.
Isn't that so?.
That's one thing.
And it would also be unthinkable to come home without salt.
That's how it is, we have to do our best.
Pushuk, pushuk, what an awful wind!
We, the warlords Shenpa,
Bernag, Mishang and Ngebum must lead the army against Jang and conquer the precious salt lakes.
Mywarriors from Horwill set up their camp with three different-coloured tents: tents as white as the snow mountains, tents as black as the night, tents as red as blood.
Our people say that Lake Tsentso is the heart of His Holiness Karmapa.
After the death ofthe former Karmapa it was a problem for sixyears to find salt in this lake.
So many salt people went the long way to Lake Yaggen, others to Angtang, to Chuwo or to Lake Biru.
Since Karmapa has been reincarnated there is again salt in Lake Tsentso.
And from year toyear it seems to get better.
This salt lake is the heart of Karmapa!
That's what one used to say, but it really is so!
This is the quality of the salt.
Is this here good?.
No difference, almost as good.
This is from here, and this from over there.
This one looks a bit better.
Which one?.
It's almost the same.
If I scrape the salt together with my golden tool, it makes itselfinto a heap.
The little heaps look like halo-flowers.
There are salt flowers as far as the eye can see.
Ifyou don't know where there is salt, there is salt under my scraper!
Ifyou don't know where the scraper is, the scraper is under the handle.
Grainy, the salt is grainy.
It doesn't depend on efficiency in this work.
It depends on the karma!
And when fetching salt, on the favour ofthe goddess.
Matsenten Gyalmo is the mistress of the
Iake, they say. I don't know much more.
Matsenten Gyalmo - if I imagine her as a human being, she is a woman.
We salt men call her mother.
She is also a goddess who keeps us from starving.
We are deeply grateful to Matsenten
Gyalmo for helping us to live.
When you think ofthe mother at home, then work fast.
When you think of the mother of the salt lake, then work slowly.
When there is no salt in the salt lake it comes from not obeying the rules.
Ifyou pollute the lake, kill here or aren't friendly with each other, the lake doesn't like it, then it isn't willing to give the salt.
I once had to wait a whole month and then I was only able to
Ioad halftheyaks, therewasn't enough salt.
The reason was that we were here in people's communes and the leader of our commune had sleptwith women on theway, and this disturbed the salt lake.
You had towait, and at times it looked as if there was going to be salt - but when you went there, there was again no salt.
More water came and flushed the salt away.
So much salt is in the carrying skin, it is heavy and full to the brim.
The salt is plentiful!
The carrying skin,
Iift it to the right, tip it to the left.
That's how we throw the salt on the heap.
You, nomad from Changtang, don't remain idle, come and work with the salt!
I don't feel lonely.
Since I was 1 3 to 1 4 years old
I've always been herding animals.
My merit is that I can handle animals, that I love them and care for them, not that I'm good at business.
I can't do business or convince others by talking.
I'm no good at smooth talking.
When I talk about responsibility - this may sound like pride - but it is so that the otherthree have far fewer worries.
They do have to go to the salt lake, extract the salt, carry it to the shore, stuff it in sacks. But at night they can sleep peacefully while I always have to worry about the animals.
I do stuffthe salt sack tightly, stuffand stuffthe lower part, so the salt won't float away on the way across the river.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the middle part, so I can rest it on my chest when loading.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the top, so the rain won't wash the salt away.
Hello, Pargen!
Hello!
-Is the salt soon ready?.
-Yes.
So soon?. Quicker than last year!
Yes, this time it went well.
Was it hard work?.
No, it was quite easy.
Then I'll slowly bring the animals round to the salt lake.
Take some snuff!.
Never in my life did it go as quickly as this time, it's like a dream!
Even such things can happen.
An old proverb says: Stay at the salt
Iake for eight days, leave on the 9th, that's how it must be.
Yes, that's the most convenient time.
And that's just the case with us this time. We really are lucky!
That all went so well this time...
That is pure luck!
...is thanks to our local god Tanglha, the Lamas or our own efforts.
The goddess accompanies the salt men all the way right to their front door, where the women and barking dogs greet them.
Yes, that's what one used to say.
The goddess Matsenten Gyalmo has shown us her great favour.
The soft snow this morning is like a water offering for the goddess.
Are there many lorries at the salt lake?.
At first only two, now there are more.
That's never been.
Only so few!?.
Now the yaks, too, will be happy.
The olderyaks, who have been to the salt lake before, think:
We shall go hungry today, but tomorrow we can return to the pastures.
The yaks who have never been here wonderwhy they have to walk so far and yet never get to the grass.
And they can't talk either!
Pull up with the left hand, sew with the right hand, whoever can't do that may not belong to the salt men.
The sack has an opening ofa "to".
Take needle and thread, sew the sack up tightly.
Theyak is wild.
At the opening ofthe sack the thieflurks.
You'll regret not having sewn it well!
Her character is that of a rather angry goddess who is very sensitive to disturbances.
If the men here quarrel, if they sleep with women or break wind at the lake, she reacts very strongly and directly to these things.
Only Margen enjoys a certain freedom here.
He doesn't have to be as careful as we.
The lake forgives him the most.
Bad deeds aren't allowed here, otherwise there's no salt.
Negative actions have the same results.
Nowadays the goddess has become more gentle, that's what the older people say.
I myselfhaven't so much experience here.
The good father is Amu Kangri.
The good mother is Matsenten Gyalmo.
The good sons are Gedun and Busum.
Maywe return to the salt lake next spring with manyyaks, many Bopsas and in good company and return safely back home again.
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods...
Mayyou,
Mother Matsenten Gyalmo, accept with pleasure the sacrificial yak.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
You accept, Mother Gyalmo, accept the offering with joy.
And now the goddess allows us one last shovel of salt.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
The god of victory in the body of man,
King Gesar,
Iooked at the warriors with the eyes of the ruler and the merciful.
And he gave them the initiation ofthe ninefold Vajra and the transformation of the soul.
Finally the great
King Gesar raised his divine voice and sang the song of the conquest of the twelve salt lakes, ofthe capture of Yulha and ofthe subjugation ofJang.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
After a return journey of 45 days the caravan came back to their families.
For one more year the salt secured them their living.
The systematic modernization increases the serious threat to the right of existence of the Tibetan salt nomads and so to the last feeling of freedom in this country.
With the decline ofthe salt men's tradition another part of cultural identity of the Tibetans will be lost.
This film is dedicated to the salt men and their families.
Our most sincere thanks go to Margen,
Pargen, the Lord of the Animals and Bopsa for having allowed us to accompany them on their extraordinary journey.
Everybody else is going.
I don't care about everybody else. You're not.
Dad?
Never mind Dad.
- You are not going on an unsupervised camping trip.
- In a backyard, Mom.
- A large backyard.
- Billy's older brother's gonna be watchin'--
Billy's older brother is 15.
Can we just eat, please?
That is not supervision for nine 13-year-olds.
I'm sorry.
- Is it just overnight?
- Girls and boys.
No, I am sorry.
I'm so sick of never being able to--
[ Man ] Kevin.
- She treats me like I'm 10!
It's, like, ridiculous!
- I'm treating you like you're--
Don't speak to me
in that tone of voice,
young man!
Benny Ray is going.
Kyle Tanner is going.
Kevin, I don't care what they're doing.
- If Kyle Tanner jumped off a bridge, would you?
- Shut up, Carol.
[ Carol ] Unacceptable.
The other kids think
I'm a joke because--
- We're not talking about
other kids.
- Why do I have to--
That is enough.
You don't talk to your mother that way.
[ Huffs ]
Oh.
It's a bunch of kids in an overnight tent.
Is it really that big a deal?
Yes. They're not old enough to--
Will the parents be home inside?
John, support me please.
What message do we send?
If you stomp away from the table, you get what you want?
- Mommy's big on messages.
- All right, Carol.
Kevin told me to shut up, and that's unacceptable.
Yes, it is.
I think maybe we have to explain the reason and not always hit him with "no."
Honey, I did give him a reason.
He just can't accept it because all his friends are going.
[ Carol Screaming ]
No!
[ Line Ringing ]
[ Cell Door Opens, Closes ]
[ Sirens Wailing ]
Where did you get the gun?
The safe.
I keep it in a safe upstairs.
Kevin knew the combination
in case--
You say you didn't wanna kill her?
What did you think would happen if you shot her?
I was just so mad.
I don't know.
What have you done?
A little face lift, that's all.
What's this? What's that?
None of it works, but it looks like it does.
And the point being--
The point being... any new client who comes in here will feel confident that we have all the resources.
I'm afraid of computers.
Where's my stuff?
Where's my photos?
I have a meeting with John Monahan of Crutcher and Dunn.
He's exploring the idea of using us for their class action asbestos.
- Really?
- They heard about our tobacco cases.
Asbestos?
Plaintiffs. We'd be on the side of merit, Ellenor.
And the case is huge.
You'd be able to fill your other ear with metal.
- Funny.
- But we're never gonna land them unless we look up to it.
Is that what this is about?
Partly.
They want us to actually try the case?
They want a meeting.
But I think that's what it's about.
Arms up.
I go into appeals this afternoon.
You got the video?
We got it.
So we have a chance.
With the video, we got a shot, right?
I'd go so far as to even say a good chance.
But courts don't like to put killers back on the street.
But the Constitution--
That's like, uh, sacred to those judges, right?
Sacred, I don't know.
But, yeah, most of them have read it.
Ms. Gamble, this boy is an honor student.
He's never been caught in the hall without a pass.
This is a book report he wrote about some poetry last fall.
Just take a second and read it.
This is a good kid.
- Mr. Larson, you're a friend of the family?
- That's right.
I know your firm.
It's as good as any in this town.
But you're primarily a civil litigator, right?
I mean no offense, but--
Well, sometimes
"friends of the family" lawyers can do more harm than good.
This boy's in a lot of trouble.
He needs an experienced criminal defense attorney.
I appreciate your candor.
I do plan to find someone--
Well, he should've been in this room from the beginning.
Do you know Bobby Donnell?
I've certainly heard of him, and not all good.
For this stuff, there's nobody better.
What's more, he doesn't phone it in.
Call him.
First thing,
I'd like to speak to him and his dad.
Good.
No problem.
The boy who shot his mother.
Oh, God.
Paper said it was
'cause he couldn't go on some camping trip or somethin'.
Where do these kids come from?
I mean, how do they get--
His own mother?
Oh, man!
What happened up in here?
Kendall. You get
kicked out of school?
Teacher conference.
Half days all week.
Mm-hmm.
Hey!
What's up, player?
What's up, man?
My mom's outta town.
I'm a menace. Right, Dad?
Uh, when the cat's away--
Red Sox tomorrow night.
Oh!
Man, this place is the bomb!
Who did it?
Do I hear Kendall, or do we have another rat?
- Lindsay!
- How you doin'?
I'm all right.
How are you?
Becky, you mind me leavin' him here for the afternoon?
I gotta be at appeals court at 2:00.
No problem.
Appeals for what?
Sholey.
The shooter on those teenagers.
Really?
What's the grounds?
Bad confession.
It was bad too.
The videotape is on your desk, all cued up.
Uh, thanks.
I hate to sound like a broken record, but I don't know how you could fight to turn that guy loose.
- He killed two innocent teenagers.
- My dad can get anybody off.
Right, Dad?
Son, I argue legal rights.
And you get the guy off, right?
[ Eugene ]
Lookit here, chief.
Meet me in the conference room, okay?
I'll be right in.
What's new in there?
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean for him to hear--
Commonwealth versus Kevin Blair, minor, murder in the second degree.
Robert Donnell for the defendant, Your Honor.
Helen Gamble for the Commonwealth.
[ Bobby ]
We ask, pending trial, that Kevin be committed... to the custody of his father,
John Blair.
Given it's a murder, Your Honor, the Department of Youth Services--
- In the interests of Kevin--
- I'm sending him to D.Y.S. for now.
Let's conference this afternoon and make a plan.
[ Bobby ]
Thank you, Your Honor.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
Thanks for taking this.
Why me?
Well, I think the media's gonna go nuts.
He is a pretty good kid.
I'd like to work it out quickly and quietly.
[ John ]
What happens now?
He'll meet with the court psychiatrist.
I'll be there for that.
Then we'll sit down with the judge.
The big decision... is whether he gets tried as an adult or a juvenile.
Adult?
He's 13.
I understand.
But when it's murder--
This isn't Arkansas.
The political pressure to go adult will be huge.
Oh, God.
Fortunately,
Helen Gamble, the D.A., isn't leaning that way.
We also caught a break getting that judge.
She is completely impervious to politics.
I'm glad she didn't grant custody to me.
I love my son.
But he killed my wife.
It's hard for me to look at him.
[ Sobbing ]
Mr. Blair.
Obviously, this is the worst thing you'll ever go through.
It-It-- It's--
And I know he probably needs me to hold him, hug him.
I can't bring myself to.
Would you... please tell him how much I love him?
Sure.
You know what criminal lawyers do.
We make sure that everybody gets their right to a fair trial.
That's what I do.
You know that?
I know.
I'm not in the business of getting murderers off.
But you do sometimes.
It's my job to make sure that the government can prove their case.
'Cause if they don't, if they can't, then they shouldn't be able to put people in jail.
I know.
You do?
Yeah.
If somebody kills somebody, you keep the police from provin' it, and you get the guy off.
In your own words,
I need to hear it.
I just got so mad.
I went running to get the gun.
Were you thinking
you'd shoot her
when you got the gun?
I don't know.
Maybe a little.
"Maybe a little"?
Kevin, I know this is difficult.
But for me to help you--
Tell me what you're thinking right now.
I wanna wake up.
You wanna wake up?
I want this to be a dream.
It's not a dream.
No.
And I would remind the court, this tape wasn't available to the defense at the time of the trial.
No, we understand that, counsel.
Are you saying your client... would not have been convicted but for this confession?
[ Eugene ]
There's no question about it.
The State had no witnesses, even though they lied to my client as you'll see in this tape.
Let's roll it.
[ Tape Loads ]
We all know you were the shooter, Brad.
This really isn't about that.
But if you help me out here, maybe there's something
I can do for you.
Shouldn't I get a lawyer or somethin'?
I think I need my lawyer.
[ Detective ]
Cigarette?
No.
If you get a lawyer, he instructs you not to talk, this thing gets all adversary.
You've been here before.
They'll send in some rookie public defender... who cares more about coverin' his own ass.
You get your life sentence.
But, hell, by tellin' you to keep quiet, his balls stay protected.
You gotta think about a few things here, Brad.
We have two eyewitnesses fingering you as the shooter.
No P.D.'s gonna change the result.
And the other-- these were teenagers you killed.
You're facing double life... with bunkmates who are gonna redo the plumbing inside your rectum.
The only friend in life you got right now is me.
I'm the only one that can help you.
Why you wanna help me?
You didn't go there to shoot them kids, did you?
You only wanted their car.
The shooting was something you didn't mean to happen.
I'm right, aren't I?
I know those kids weren't angels, and I know that you're not a cold-blooded kind of person.
They fought back, didn't they?
You just wanted their car.
They fought back.
Three hours and 13 minutes later, my client confessed to killing
Wanda and Steven Simmons.
And your claim
is that this confession
is unconstitutional?
He asked for his lawyer.
As soon as that happened, the interrogation, by law, has to stop.
That tape made clear the defendant never asked for his lawyer.
Are you serious?
He only said--
He never officially asked.
He said at the very start--
That he thought maybe he should get a lawyer.
But he never directly asked.
- "I think I need my lawyer."
- I have to admit, Mr. Coffee, you're splitting hairs.
If a suspect says,
"I think I need my lawyer," his intent obviously--
- But he changed his mind.
- He's not allowed to change his mind.
He's not allowed to change his mind?
His mind can't be changed by the police officer.
No, it can't.
As soon as a suspect asks for his lawyer, discussion stops.
Here, it didn't.
It sounds cliché, but "normal kid."
Who killed his mother?
Yes.
Normal 13-year-old boys, they don't--
I understand.
What I'm saying is
I found no psychosis, no schizophrenia.
Then why?
He lost his temper,
and a gun was handy.
Do me a favor, Doctor, and have the decency to not sound casual about this.
This boy, he was close to his mother.
They had a very good relationship.
He seems stunned that she isn't coming back.
Doesn't that suggest some sort of diminished capacity?
He shoots her, but he can't understand why she's not living?
Uh, it isn't that.
Cognitively, he knows.
But emotionally, he's experiencing deep grief.
And there's nothing in his history?
I've only spent a couple of hours so far, but so far, I've found nothing.
Well, boys just don't shoot their parents.
Give me something.
You want a reason, Judge, turn on the news.
Nightlinewill put on experts.
They'll talk about family values, bad parenting.
Pick up a newspaper.
You'll see articles about too much television.
Maybe he got dropped on his head at birth.
There's no shortage of opinions.
And you can throw them all out.
There must be a sign.
Sure, there's a sign.
In Little League, he threw his bat a few times.
He fought at recess on occasion.
If you're desperate for a sign, cling to those.
But there simply is nothing overt... to explain why this kid had an impulse to kill.
No reason as to why he couldn't control that impulse.
You want it to be comprehensible.
We all do.
It may never be.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
So, what are you going to do?
Uh--
Uh, I'm not sure yet.
On the one hand, he--
I think I have to charge him as an adult.
That is not the way to go, Helen.
You said yourself
"quickly and quietly."
I understand.
But I'm looking at a pretty mature, well-adjusted kid here.
Who gets served?
The reason you brought me in is because this case is different.
It's not about win/lose.
Now, what gets served?
That's what I keep asking.
What gets served?
Well, let's make a decision.
I'm afraid it's gonna have to be made by you, Your Honor.
Fine.
I'll set the hearing for tomorrow.
This kid is gonna lose his life.
Part of me hopes you win this.
But that question,
"Who gets served"--
[ Sighs ]
Where my duty lies,
I gotta go adult.
[ Ellenor ]
I don't like it.
[ Jimmy ]
I don't even know what it is.
[ Rebecca ] It's a painting.
But it's all jumbled.
What kind of message does that send?
You teach kids to color inside the lines.
They come in and see that--
The message it sends is flush is expensive.
Lindsay bought it?
Ah! Got it on loan.
She wants it here when our asbestos clients come in.
Oh, please.
Ellenor, don't "Oh, please."
You know it works.
Clients just glance at our track record.
What matters to them are the cars we drive.
If they're expensive, we must be good.
If we look rich, we must be winners.
You really think we could get this trial?
Hey, we got an interview.
Timing couldn't be better.
We're hot off of beating the tobacco industry.
Bobby's name is in all the papers with this kid shooting his mother.
What are we talking about here?
[ Ellenor ]
Class action.
Thousand-plus plaintiffs.
Even if we split the contingency, we're lookin' at seven figures minimum.
- Seven for us?
- For us.
I love that painting.
[ Chuckling ]
Think they'll win it this year?
The Sox?
Next year.
Every year is next year for the Red Sox.
Yeah. It must be tough playin' in this town.
Fans have a million years of frustration pent up.
Wonder how they manage to play at all.
I can't feel sorry for ballplayers.
Makin' that kind of money to play a game in the summer and take the winters off--
[ Scoffs ]
They don't get my sympathy.
You're that lawyer for that killer, aren't you?
Sholey-- that guy who killed those two teenagers.
You're his lawyer.
Yeah.
Can I ask you somethin'?
How do you do that?
I mean, isn't it hard to--
You know, people like that?
Every man or woman gets his day in court.
I understand.
But this guy's pure scum, isn't he?
He's a human being.
It's just... those teenagers, they were my kids.
I'm, um, sorry.
You like what you do for a living, Mr. Young?
It's nice to see you do draw lines.
You'd never sympathize with a ballplayer.
[ Slams Newspaper Down ]
It went okay.
I didn't think the D.A. came back with much.
So? We could win?
We should win, Brad, unless they want to rewrite the law.
But there is no time limit.
My bet is they're gonna sit on this case a long, long time.
And what, not do anything?
You gotta understand.
Us winning means turning you loose.
You killed two people.
Setting you free isn't gonna be on anybody's list of priorities.
But it went good?
I think it did.
Yes.
When I was assigned this case, every instinct was let's not make this a bigger tragedy than it already is.
But he committed a very adult crime.
It was knowing.
He walked upstairs, turned the combination on a safe to the left, to the right and back to the left.
He loaded bullets into a revolver.
He walked back downstairs... and executed a human being.
[ Bobby ]
If he is tried as an adult, he receives a life sentence.
Let's not dance around that reality.
He's got no defense of the crime itself.
As an adult, second degree murder carries an automatic life sentence.
- We have to face that.
- We also have to face what he did.
[ Bobby ]
He's 13 years old.
If he had impregnated his teacher, the teacher would go to jail and the world would be saying,
"He's a child."
But because of the politics and outrage of murder, the world says, "Adult.
"Treat him as an adult.
Don't be soft."
As much as I feel for this boy, and I do, as much as I feel for his family,
I can't escape--
I can't look at him and say,
"He's just a kid."
[ Bobby ]
You can say that, Helen, because he is a kid.
And if you're saying there's no chance of rehabilitation... with a 13-year-old, then... you're saying rehabilitation shouldn't even exist as a concept.
He didn't steal a car, Bobby.
I'll take this under advisement.
[ John ]
How you doin', kid?
We'll, uh--
We're gonna get through this.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I know.
Will you tell Carol
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
Does she hate me now?
No.
[ Jimmy ]
Asbestos clients.
Show time.
Here they come.
Here they come.
- Okay.
So you're gonna buzz me.
- What do I say?
- Anything.
Just stay on the line.
- This is so ridiculous.
Shh! There's no need to panic.
I'll walk you through it.
John, if you go into a courtroom oozing anxiety, the judge will see that.
Okay, you're gonna do exactly as I say.
We're looking for Lindsay Dole.
[ Lindsay ]
Hold on.
Hi, Mr. Monahan?
It's me. Um, let's go into the conference room.
Rebecca, could you show them?
Of course.
The reason I'm not panicked is a 12-B-6 isn't just viable, it will win.
Hi.
[ Lindsay ]
I have a meeting. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Two minutes, you buzz me.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry it's a little crazy.
I've got a panicked house counsel in Detroit.
- Well, we appreciate your agreeing to the meeting.
- My pleasure.
Cutting to it--
Your success against the tobacco company has our interest piqued.
Especially since, uh--
Well, going up against the asbestos industry, uh--
We're facing a comparable Goliath.
- How many in the class?
- We're up to almost 1,300.
Certified?
[ Woman ]
Mm-hmm.
[ Monahan ]
We've already survived
a motion to decertify.
Most of the discovery is done. We have a September trial date.
- [ Phone Rings ]
- I'm sorry. Yes?
Hey, Lindsay.
Been to any wild orgies lately?
Calm-- Calm down, John.
John, listen. Who's the judge?
Albright. Albright.
[ Typing ]
Albright.
Okay, I've got him.
Has a reputation for being colloquial.
I definitely want local counsel.
Oh, good news.
He's spoken at seminars on frivolous litigation.
He'll be receptive to the 12-B-6 and our Rule 11.
Now, I--
I don't want to file till July, however.
I'm just curious.
You ever tried, uh, mud wrestling?
The reason is he has a summer home on Lake Ontario.
He puts in a three-day work week. He likes to keep his docket down.
Statistically, he kicks 30% more cases in July and August.
John? John,
I have to call you back.
I'm in a meeting with clients.
Okay? Okay.
Bye-bye.
I'm very sorry.
You've never done an asbestos litigation, have you?
No, but that's not the problem.
- Can I cut to what
I do perceive as a problem?
- Absolutely.
I had a chance to look over some of the pleadings and witness lists.
Public record. Sorry.
We may have a difference in trial philosophy.
Which would be?
You seem to be emphasizing causation.
On these kinds of cases, we tend not to.
How do you prove a case without causation?
Well, I'm not saying ignore it, but when proving it depends on science, you're putting two heavy burdens on a jury.
One, you're asking them to understand it.
Two, you're asking them to stay awake.
Anything they don't understand, they get suspicious of.
And with asbestos, just like tobacco, you have a presumption.
They already know it kills.
The defense can't pick apart that premise.
They can pick apart science.
I'm wary of leaving evidence out.
Yeah, that's what I figured.
We're probably not the right firm for you.
Be seated.
Under
Minnick versus Mississippi, the law is quite clear.
When a suspect asks for his attorney, all further interrogation must stop.
The tape here was very disturbing, seeing the police lie about having witnesses, misrepresenting information.
Nevertheless, this kind of police conduct is entirely permissible.
And since we find the defendant stopped short of directly asking for counsel, we unanimously find the confession to be admissible.
The conviction therefore stands.
Adjourned.
[ Gavel Raps ]
Permission to address the court.
Permission to address this court.
Proceed.
You people just ignored the law.
We've made our ruling, and I see no--
I heard your ruling.
Uh, the other day,
I had to explain
to my 10-year-old... how I could come into this room and fight for a man who killed two people.
Yesterday, I had to look this man in the eye--
[ Judge Clarke ]
Counsel--
Counsel what?
You gonna give me a speech, Judge?
Tell me how the Bill of Rights, how the Constitution has to count for something?
I gave that speech to my kid.
I told myself that... while havin' to look at the father of two dead teenagers, two kids my client shot!
[ Judge Callahan ]
Mr. Young--
Permission to address this court!
Ten years I've been puttin' them back out there-- criminals, sometimes rapists, sometimes murderers.
Ten years, all the time tellin' myself there's a reason.
You're 10 seconds from a contempt order!
Do it! There are rules!
Rules, damn it!
We don't let the police coerce confessions.
We don't let 'em beat down doors without warrants.
We don't let them grill suspects after they ask for their lawyers.
My client damn well asked for his lawyer, and all three of you sittin' up there, you know it!
- You're out of order!
- You're out of order!
You disgraced the bench, this room.
You just raped the Sixth Amendment!
I hold you in contempt.
I hold all three of you in contempt!
Take him and put him in lockup.
I'll rot in that cell... if giving you respect is a condition for my getting out.
I'll rot.
Dad, did you hit somebody?
No.
How long?
Till morning.
I argued a called strike.
They'll let him visit for an hour.
I'll keep him with me tonight.
He belongs in here with me.
- I'll be back.
- Thanks again.
So, what happened?
Sit down, buddy.
You heard me talk of your Uncle Curtis?
Jail Uncle Curtis?
Yeah. You remember what he went to jail for?
They thought he knocked off a liquor store and capped somebody.
But he didn't, right?
Yeah.
And, uh, the reason he ended up in prison... was that he fit the description of whoever did do it, and the police arrested him.
They kept him in a room for 20 hours.
Kept makin' him drink coffee and not lettin' him go to the bathroom.
Kept tellin' him that if he'd just confess, that everything would go better.
And that if he didn't confess, they'd arrest my sister and they'd both get the death penalty.
Told him if he cooperated, he could leave.
And after 20 hours, they had him to the point... where he would say anything just to go home.
And he signed a confession to a crime he didn't commit.
You hate the police, don't you?
I don't hate the police.
Most of them are good people.
Kendall, most of my clients did the crime.
I won't lie to you about that.
The reason I fight for 'em... is as soon as we allow the police to use illegal methods, sure, more guilty people will be convicted, but more innocent people will too.
That's what I fight for.
Here he comes.
Stay calm.
Everybody calm. Look busy.
Um, file.
Are they hiring us?
I don't know.
Stay calm!
I'm calm. You stay calm!
- [ Rebecca ]
Shh!
- Hi.
Mr. Monahan.
Thank you for letting me drop by on such short notice.
- Sure.
- Listen, uh,
we've thought about it.
We would like to hire you.
Really? I am serious about our trial philosophy.
[ Monahan ]
I understand.
We're on board with it.
- You obviously get results.
- Fine.
Files will be delivered?
Today. I'd like to schedule a coordination conference for next week if possible.
We can do that.
Great.
I'll be in touch.
Good.
[ Door Opens ]
Let him get in the elevator.
Four, three, two, one.
[ Screaming, Laughing ]
Be seated.
For the past several days,
I've felt compelled to blame.
Easy access to guns, television, movies, brainwashing children with violence-- all disgustingly denying any accountability.
Blame.
But in this room, young man, it comes down to youraccountability.
I doubt that you
or anybody else
in this room... will ever make sense of why you killed your mother.
There's no rhyme,
no reason,
and ultimately no excuse.
You ended your own childhood.
I'm granting the district attorney's petition to charge you as an adult.
- Adjourned.
- [ Gavel Raps ]
[ Sighs ]
I gotta know why.
We all fall where we fall on this, Mr. Donnell.
Nobody's right, nobody's wrong.
We all fall where we fall.
Yeah.
But you're the judge.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm the judge.
You wanna swap places?
You could've opted for hope instead of--
What makes you think
I didn't?
You know,
I sit on that bench every day seeing the evil in people.
Hope for me lies in the child.
Hope won't allow me to see the child in him.
He murdered his own mother.
That doesn't sound like legal reasoning to me.
Well, legal reasoning can only deal... with the consequences of what he did.
And I'll be damned if I'm going to send that message... to the next
13-year-old with a gun.
This was about
one 13-year-old.
With the power to make you hate God.
I have to believe a child couldn't do that.
If a child could, then that surely is the death of hope.
An apology lets you out.
You don't get it.
Did you really think we would set him free?
I'm naive enough to believe the Sixth Amendment means something.
Liberty doesn't lie in the Constitution,
Mr. Young.
It doesn't lie in the law or the courtroom.
It lies in a man's heart.
And in my heart, I wasn't going to turn loose a man who I knew would kill again.
"The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not sure it's right."
If you're gonna quote
Learned Hand, try to remember the essence of his speech.
And the spirit of your ruling, Judge, is that you knew you were wrong.
We have to be able to sleep at night too.
And you didn't sleep last night, did you?
I congratulate you on your righteousness.
I salute your ability to look at death... and feel nothing but patriotism for playing your part.
We all signed up to do our jobs, Judge.
You betrayed yours.
And I will not stand here and let you tell me what's in my heart.
Now, there's no crime to being a coward.
It just shouldn't be cloaked in a robe.
Asbestos class action.
Lindsay's backing up her threat to make us flush.
I'd probably celebrate more if I were a partner.
You will be, Jimmy.
How you feelin'?
Your wounds healin' up okay?
Yeah. Yours?
You mean Spivak?
Uh, no, I--
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just a guy.
Another one will come along.
Plenty of fish.
Schools.
I've had judges look the other way before, but--
But what?
Some of the disgust is my own.
When my son said,
"My dad can get murderers off.
He can get anybody off," it hit me like a train.
Since, I've been lookin' at myself through his eyes.
What I do, what I am.
I needed that appeals court for some kind of validation.
Eugene, the disgrace of that ruling... belongs to those judges, not to you.
Explain that to my boy, could you?
The courts didn't wanna put a killer back out there.
I did.
Explain to him how
I'm the good guy, huh?
Look, it's not always a meritocracy.
I mean, judges rule for the wrong reasons sometimes.
Clients choose you because of paint jobs.
Lindsay landed a coup with fake computers.
And you know what?
That case she got, every firm in town would drool over it.
It could make us a lot of money.
But what I'll go home and celebrate a little tonight... is that you and I spent the last few days... fighting for people no firm in this town would touch.
And we both lost.
Maybe it's right we lost.
I don't know.
But what I do know is what makes the courtroom a noble place... is that people like you go in there and fight.
Sometimes, on principle alone.
I don't know how long
I can keep doin' it.
Me neither.

You stinker!
Okay.
Where were these found, guys ?
Green one on the left side there, red one on the right side. don't let nobody come up here.
The police in west Memphis, Arkansas confirmed today that three young boys were brutally murdered.
The bodies of Weaver elementary school second graders
Steven branch,
Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore were pulled from a shallow creek earlier today.
There are rumors that the boys may have been sexually mutilated the police say that they do not yet have any suspects in the case.
The missing 8-year-old boys were discovered in an area known as
Robin hood hills, a secluded patch of woods behind the blue beacon truck wash along interstate 40 in west Memphis.
Imagine all the evil that you could think of, how someone could be murdered and that's how these three children died.
No family should have to go through this, unfortunately, it's gonna happen again somewhere, another town, it's gonna happen again,
I'm sure, a lot of bad people out there in the world.
I don't know why these three little boys were murdered, did they see something they were not supposed to see ?
Did they hear things they were not supposed to hear ?
I do not know that,
I see no reason,
I see no motive for why these three little boys were murdered.
Live from KAIT 8 TV, good neighbors you can turn to for news, weather and sports.
This is KAIT 8 news.
Good evening,
I'm Diana Davis.
And I'm Tony Brooks.
In a statement given to police obtained by a Memphis newspaper
17-year-old
Jessie misskelley allegedly confesses to watching two other suspects choke, rape, and sexually mutilate three west Memphis second graders.
Jenna Newton reports.
According to the published report
Misskelley told police he watched 18-year-old
Damien echols, and 16-year-old
Jason Baldwin brutalize the children with a club and a knife.
The report says
Misskelley told police
Echols and Baldwin raped one of the boys and sexually mutilated another as part of a cult ritual.
Misskelley is quoted as saying he did not take part in the rape and mutilation but that he helped subdue one victim who tried to escape.
At a press conference, inspector Gary gitchell said the case against the accused teens is very strong.
One a scale of 1 to 10, how solid is the case ?
Eleven.
It appears satanic worship may have played a role in the murders.
Since the very beginning of the investigation people all around west Memphis have come forward with stories of satanic cults.
Rev. Tommy Stacy's church is down the street from where the bodies were found.
One year ago Damien Echols told the church's youth minister he had a pact with the devil and he was going to hell.
I do know that my youth director talked to Damien extensively at the revival that we had and he told him that he could not be saved.
That he could not give his heart to Jesus and my youth director then tried to get him to take a Bible and he made the statement that he could not take a Bible because if he did, the rest of 'em would get him.
In west Memphis,
Jenna Newton,
 KAIT 8 night news.
Christopher never hurt anybody.
He had a gentle, loving and giving heart.
And they crucified him in those woods, and they humiliated his little body.
They took his little manhood before he even knew what it was.
And I hate 'em for it.
I've never hated anybody in my life.
And I hate these three.
And the mothers that bore them.
I can't imagine...
What was going through Michael's mind.
Was he...
Calling for me ?
How long did they leave him there tied up on that ditch bank before they decided to kill him ?
What were they doing to him ?
Was he conscious or unconscious ?
Did he watch the other two boys...
Get cut ?
He was really being killed by real monsters.
On TV !
Pam, first of all what are you holding in your hand there ?
It's Stevie's boy scout,
I got it back yesterday.
And, I've been wearing it around my head like this.
Did he like scouting ?
Oh, he loved it, he loved it.
He loved it.
Do you blame yourself for this ?
I have, I have,
I have been on a guilt trip about it but, it wasn't my fault
I was at work.
Have you contemplated joining Stevie ?
Have I ?
Have you thought about suicide ?
Have I ?
Uh, "suicide" ?
I felt like dying, but not suicide, no, not suicide.
Do you feel that the people that did this were worshipping--
Satan ?
Yes, I do.
Why ?
Just look at the freaks.
Just look at 'em.
They look like punks.
Little Jessie told me he didn't do it, didn't have anything to do with it, he wasn't there.
I believe him.
I think the cops just can't find who done it...
And they gotta put it on somebody.
I wanna tell the whole world my son's innocent because I know he is innocent.
I know where he was and I know he's innocent and I wanna tell the world and I want the world to know.
This boy is not capable of the crime that he has been arrested for.
I've seen him take a little kitten and love it just like you'd love a little baby.
It's like a nightmare, a nightmare that you can't wake up from.
Our son is innocent.
We intend to prove it.
"Yea, though
I walk through the valley
"of the shadow of death
"I shall fear no evil.
"And I'm not scared of the devil.
"I gotta know who my comforter is.
Thou rod and thou staff comfort me."
And I thank you lord for lettin' me be able to believe in that with all my heart.
I hope y'all really believe in your master the Satan, that sleuthfoot, devil himself, because he's not gonna help ya.
He's gonna laugh at ya, mock at ya, and torture ya.
He didn't need your help.
The devil's got all the devils he needs.
The good lord said Lucifer, and a third of the angels were cast from heaven.
He didn't need them, but he took their mind and he manipulated 'em, and they prayed to Satan and they prayed to the devil and they had their satanic worship services out here, and they had all types of wild homosexual orgies
I've been told, crazy things.
To me, this place as I stand is like hell on earth because I know that three babies were killed right out here were I stand.
I know my son was castrated and possibly laid there on that bank and bled to death.
I know he was choked.
I know one boy's head was beat in beyond recognition.
I know one little boy was skinned almost like an animal, cut, had to shave his head, had all types of injures to the head where they just kept beating him and poundin' on him, and killin' him and killin' him it's like they enjoyed it, they killed them two or three times.
Jessie Misskelley Jr,
Jason Baldwin,
Damien Echols,
I hope your master the devil does take you soon.
I want you to meet him real soon.
And the day you die
I'm gonna praise god and I make you a promise, the day you die, every year on may 5th
I'm gonna come to your grave side,
I'm gonna spit on you,
I'm gonna curse the day you were born, and I'm sure while I'm standin' there
I'm gonna have to have other bodily functions let go upon your grave.
I promise you as god is my witness
I'll visit all three of your graves.
The statement
Jessie gave to the police is a lie, it's not true.
I don't see why he would do something like that to another person.
I can see why they might think
I was in a cult
'cause I wear
Metallica t-shirts and stuff.
But, I'm not in nothin' like that.
I couldn't kill an animal or a person.
I don't worship the devil or anything like that.
I worship god like every normal person around here does.
I got a favorite pet, my pet iguana.
Had her for a little over a year now.
I usually go fishin' by myself, right in my backyard.
Just go out there, and my pet cat would be out there his name's Charlie.
Whenever I catch a fish
I always give it to him.
I didn't kill these three little boys.
I didn't kill those three little boys.
They were under a lot of pressure they had to find somebody to lay this off on before people started losin' their jobs.
The public was gettin' real upset seein' the cops were incompetent, couldn't do their jobs, they had to do something fast.
And we were really the obvious choice because we stood out from everybody else.
This all worked out to their advantage.
No one's gonna be saying that you're stupid or you're dumb, or making fun of you, but the court's gonna be very interested in determining exactly at what level you were functioning, how well you're able to read, how well you're able to write, things of that nature.
Does that make sense ?
Mm-hmm.
So, if the court determines that you are operating below average, then there's a possibility that the court will not be allowed or the state will not be allowed to impose the death penalty against you, do you understand what that means ?
We've got about 10 weeks before the trial comes up in January.
Are you looking forward to having the trial ?
A little bit.
Not much.
Hello ?
I have a collect call, your name please.
Jessie.
Will you pay ?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Hey, son, how ya doin' ?
Alright.
That's good.
My hand still hurts.
Your hand still hurts ?
Did you ever find out if it was broke or not ?
No, I ain't found out.
I can move it.
If you can move it, it's not broke.
It hurts.
If you can move it, it's not broke.
It's gonna hurt a while 'cause you bruised it pretty good.
You just gotta learn not to hit them walls hit somebody else.
There was nobody in my room to hit.
Oh, okay.
I didn't hit the wall,
I hit the commode.
You "hit the commode" ?
Yeah, I hit it on the side.
I didn't even put a dent in it either.
That must be a hard commode.
I heard that.
What time is everyone gonna come up ?
I don't know.
Y'all come up anytime,
'cause y'all be in here with me.
Well, uh...
We'll see you Saturday.
They're gonna have to go through the metal detector when you come through the front door,
I want everybody to do that, they've got that portable thing they can bring from little rock if you need it.
Like the airport deal.
We couldn't afford no $3,000 metal detector.
What I planned on doin' was usin' two portables at this door, that's why I want everybody, outside of lawyers, and I want them to come through this door.
There's a potential of a problem area with the...
Strong feelings of the family, and that's to be understood so, security, not only coming in and out of the courtroom is a problem, but keeping the onlookers and the family and people segregated from the accused is another problem that you'll have, Darwin.
My intention was to bring this boy in before, long before court and have him in sight.
Obviously I'm very concerned about security.
Simply because of the death threats that have happened, but I don't wanna give the jury the impression, if we have
20 state troopers and 50 county deputies, it's gonna give the impression to the jury that my client is a very dangerous person which he's not, and I don't want the jury to get the wrong impression,
I don't want there to be such a circus in the courtroom with reporters and cameras that the jury forgets about what they're here for and that is to administer justice.
We expect the proof's going to show that this defendant confessed, that he was not coerced...
We do not contend that the proof's going to show that every word that came out of his mouth was the truth.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury this statement that
Mr. Misskelley gave the west Memphis police department is a false story, the interrogation techniques that were deployed against him at the time of his statement on June the 3rd rendered him completely incapable...
They broke his will, they scared him beyond all measures.
The proof is going to show that this defendant was an accomplice to Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin in the commission of these horrifying murders and we will ask you to return your verdict of guilty on three counts of capital murder.
We don't know what the truth is but when it really gets down to it...
His daddy and I are gonna look him scare in the eyes and say, son, did you do this ?
Was you even there ?
That's when we will believe.
If he told me he did it...
Which I don't believe he did, but if he told me he did it...
He'd have to do his time.
Suffer the consequences.
If he admits to this, he would be strictly on his own.
We wouldn't even send him a dollar for a pack of cigarettes.
No, you're wrong there.
Yes, we would.
No, I would, he's my son.
I'll send him money.
But, he will have to do his time.
I wouldn't give him a nickel.
He's my son.
We can be talkin' about-- we could be talking about my son.
If my son did something that horrible.
No, I wouldn't give him a nickel.
Let him suffer.
You can't turn your blood away.
I don't know how you say you could, and we're gonna have a problem over this.
But, I know how it is being up there in jail without anything.
Well, that's beside the point, if he's guilty if he's guilty of doing this to these little boys.
No.
He's not.
Well I'm saying he's not too.
But, if he happens to-- if it's proven.
No, forget it, no.
No.
I don't believe he did it.
I'll never believe he did it.
This is to Jessie Jr.
Today's his 18th birthday.
And I haven't seen him
I don't know where to go see him at,
I'm gonna sing
"happy birthday" to him.

And don't smoke too much.
Now, he's legal to get 'em, ain't he ?
Yeah, he's legal to smoke now.
I may not be his biological mother but giving birth don't make a parent, and I've had him since he was four...
And it took me about a year to assure that little boy
I was gonna be here for him, he wouldn't wanna go to school he wouldn't go outside and play because was afraid I wouldn't be here when he came in and when he was in kindergarten if he'd come in and I happened not to be where he can see me when he first come in he would be hysterical when I got to him.
And...
I've always known that...
He was...
He had a problem.
And I,
I've always been real protective of him.
My mom sent me this one.
"There are all sorts of sons
"sons can be slouchy
"sons can be sweet
"sons can be grouchy...
"Sons can be neat
"sons can be broke
"sons can be well-to-do...
But no son could ever be loved more than you."
And it says
"happy birthday".
I cry a lot when I'm in here
'cause I miss my family and everything.
And I just cry a lot.
After that, I go to bed, try to sleep.
My name is
Ella Sanders, my son was
Antonio Sanders, and he got killed,
Halloween night, 1990.
My name is Brenda mcclaine and my brother was stabbed to death.
I'm Brenda east and my son, Robert,
23 at the time was murdered in 1990.
My name's Anne wallen my daughter was
Sheila Dixon she was murdered
January the 12th of '91.
I'm Wanda rany.
My daughter was murdered,
June the 27th, we think, we're not sure, they're calling it a crime of passion, they not only throwed her out and let her lay two weeks, he poured acid on her to deteriorate her body.
I didn't have the pleasure...
Of telling my daughter good-bye.
Funeral was closed casket...
And this is what
I had on the casket.
And it's still very unreal to me.
When the telephone rings
I expect it to be her.
My name's Todd Moore.
My son was mark Moore, he was murdered along with
Christopher Byers and Steven branch may 5th, 1993.
I cannot describe the pain...
That my family has went through they didn't just kill my son they killed part of me.
They killed a part of my wife, her daughter.
I'm so frustrated because it seems like they have so much rights, we have no rights, they had in the paper the other day, now the taxpayers in griton county are gonna have to buy them a suit because they don't want them to go into court looking like what they are, criminals.
They're in jail, they should wear jail clothes.
Why do they need to have a nice suit bought by the county so they look presentable ?
They don't want 'em in shackles and chains.
You know, these are not boys that murdered our kids.
They stopped being boys when they planned this, and I sit there and watch their parents comin' out of courts, crying talkin' about their son's rights.
What about
 our son's rights ?
Where the hell was his rights out on that ditch bank ?
He had no rights, he had the rights to be brutally murdered ?
To be beat to death, an 8-year-old little boy ?
Where was his rights ?
I'm Diane Moore,
Michael Moore's mother, last week in flash market, the echol's man was in there staring me down.
Like it was my fault that I had a child that his child could murder.
We seen the people that are supporting these people, that look at us like we're scum, and these other people are just...
The greatest thing that they've ever known, now they wanna have 'em all just dressed up and act like little choir boys in court.
Here you go, he didn't do anything wrong.
My son didn't do anything wrong, he's just a boy.
Now, on June the 3rd did you have an assignment to locate a particular person ?
My assignment was to contact
Jessie Misskelley Jr.
At that time was the defendant a suspect ?
No, sir.
If he was not a suspect why were you assigned to contact him ?
He was a friend with-- friends with Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin.
What, if anything, did he tell you...
During this conversation before the tape recording ?
He told us that he had attended some satanic cult-type meetings, that boys, along with girls would attend, there would be sessions of sex, orgies, as he called them.
Uh, that...
Dogs and animals had been killed and in fact those animals, portions of them, have been eaten by the members.
I believe there's angels on earth,
I believe there's demons on earth.
And I believe as angels try to help people,
I believe demons try to possess and hurt people to do the devil's will.
Just how angels try to help people to do god's will.

There's no doubt in your mind that about 5:30 P.M.
Jessie was sittin'-- he was sittin' right down here.
I had seen the police over there twice.
I'd also seen little Jessie over there and they talked to him.
Police officers talked to him.
Yes, sir.
They had to find somebody to pin this on.
This publicity was getting out of hand.
Can you ask those folks inside to step out for just a second ?
I know that
I've talked to each of you, if not directly, indirectly, we need to be very, very careful about who we talk to with regard to the media involved in this case.
There are several members of the media who apparently have no ethics and have decided that they're gonna do everything they can to dig up mud and sling mud, it's not gonna do anything but hurt Jessie and his chances of receiving a fair trial.
You, as friends of Jessie and relatives of Jessie, are prime targets for these members of the press.
And if we just remember the one rule is don't talk to anybody, then we won't have to worry about it.
Does that make sense ?
So, again I caution you not to talk to anybody in the press, it's just gonna hurt us, thanks.

One thing I like about this right here, black powder gun, is they can't pull any type of ballistics on it, if by some chance you was to shoot something with it, every bullet rifles through the chamber just a little bit different.
So, they just can't pull no ballistics off this one.
There's a few people I wouldn't mind shooting with it.
But, hopefully the courts and the justice system's gonna take care of 'em.
If they reach prison, they'll get took care of.
Todd, I could save the state a lot of money.
If they just let me line them three sonofaguns up,
I'd say this one here is for you Jessie, and we're gonna go for the jug of water.
Oh, Jessie, I done blowed you half in two, son !
This one here's for you, Damien, you that black circle right in the middle.
Oh, you got hurt.
Damn, that sure looked painful, didn't it ?
Hey, Jason ?
I want you to smile and blow me a kiss for this one.
Let's go back to Jessie.
I just wounded him,
I want him to bleed a little bit like he made my baby bleed.
Oh, Jessie...
That breaks my heart thinkin' about that scum.
'Cause this right here's all that needs to be done to him, shot slowly, with a real nice firearm.
And it ain't got no consideration or no feeling who it's aimin' at, just like they didn't care about killing my baby.
I'd be happy with lining them up.
I wouldn't have no problem with it.
I think old Jessie's still kickin' a little.
Put him out of his misery.
What kind of range do we got in the courtroom ?
Probably about
10 foot right here.
Go ahead and waste old Jessie.
I don't see that bein' much of a problem.
No, because
I can just see the scum.
That's good.
Go ahead, he's wiggling, alright,
I could live with that.
During the course of these conversations was anything shown to the defendant ?
Yes, sir.
Alright, what was shown to him ?
There was a picture that insp. Gitchell showed him.
And what was that a picture of ?
One of the victims.
When I showed Jessie this photograph, he took it into his hand and he just went back in his chair like this, and he just locked in on it, fixed in on the photograph, and just kept staring at it and staring at it.
Initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he ?
Yes, sir, he did.
Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence, depicting one of the boy's bodies, that was shown to Jessie ?
Yes.
And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed ?
Shortly before, yes, sir.
Why did you guys do that ?
There had to be a reason to do that.
There were times when Jessie would not be talking, he's getting slower with information, he's telling us things, it's over and over, the same thing.
Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
You and insp. Gitchell did these things to evoke a response.
Yes, sir.
To evoke confession.
Evoke a response, keep him talking.
Did it ever occur to you that Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap ?
No, sir, it didn't to me on that date.
Did you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps ?
No, sir.
Did it ever occur to you that this was gonna scare him, showing him a picture of a body ?
That it would scare him ?
I don't know,
I guess he's scared into making a statement, yes, sir.
I'm getting nervous every day.
Why ?
Why ?!
Oh, okay.
That's a stupid question.
Okay.
I can barely hold this phone.
It's getting closer and closer.
I don't wanna even think about it.
I can imagine what they're gonna do to me.
I can imagine.
But, I'm not gonna think that though.
Think good thoughts, while I'm on the phone.
Talk about something good while I'm on the phone.
Hey, you're supposed to be talking to me, not your friends.
These people make me mad.
You know it ?
Uh-huh.
They get to go out and screw people and I can't.
That's what y'all do,
I can't do that.
Well, you will later.
I will later ?
How do you know ?
I mean if I can get out, we will.
If I don't get out, we won't.
What I was gonna ask you that Sunday, that I dreamed about you.
You wouldn't believe what I was dreaming.
It freaked me out.
Wanna hear it ?
Huh ?
Yeah.
We was having sex, alright ?
O.K.
We went to the bathroom, we had sex.
When I was going out the front door we had sex right there.
We done it out in the yard, in front of everybody.
It freaked me out !
I woke up,
I was sweatin' bad.
I said I hope that dream come true quick.
What are you gonna do when you get off the phone ?
Sneak back home.
Go back home ?
I'm gonna go back home too, when I get off the phone.
I wish you could.
I wish you could.
Yeah.
Well, my time's up, okay ?
I gotta go, okay ?
I love you.
I love you too.
Bye-bye.
Can you get it in there ?
Yeah.
I think those two oughta do fine.
Yeah, I'm sure they will be.
Yeah, this one's good.
This one came out.
O.K.
Big difference from any other Christmas.
One I'll never forget.
It's the first one without him.
I wish you could've been here to hear me sing.
He liked to hear me sing.
This little Christmas tree will stay there real well, it's in there tight enough,
I don't think the wind will blow it over or anything.
C'mere and kneel down here by me.
Oh, god, why did you let this happen ?
Please help us through it.
God, please help us through this.
This is an enlarged photograph of the crime scene, this is the ditch where the bodies were found,
Michael Moore was found in this area at the bottom,
Steve branch was found just behind where these trees are in the stream, and Christopher Byers was found just below, that body right here.
This is exhibit 22, which is the body of Michael Moore, after removing him from the water.
The way he was found.
This is the body of Steve branch,
Steve branch is the one that had the injures to his face.
Was it a particular part of his face ?
The left side.
This is state exhibit 24, the body of
Christopher Byers.
What kind of injures did Chris Byers have, did you observe ?
It looked as though his penis had been removed.
Could you see the pictures from where you were sitting ?
Yeah, that's why
I had to leave.
Why ?
Because I always-- seeing my boy the way he was,
I'll always have that picture of what he looked like, in my mind.
But, you never knew until now.
You said early on you really didn't wanna know.
But, now you're hearing it, is it a lot harder than what you thought it was going to be ?
It's a whole lot harder than I thought it would be.
It like going back to may 5th and reliving it all over again.
Inspector, let's talk about the things that Jessie told you that are just absolutely incorrect, on page 9 of his statement,
Jessie says that the murders took place around noon, how did you know that was incorrect ?
Because the young boys were still in school.
Did at any time when he was telling you these things that you knew were incorrect, did it ever occur to you that what he was tellin' you was false ?
His entire story was false ?
In Jessie's case,
I feel he did tell us a good bit of the truth but then they also lessened their activity in a statement, that's just common, at least in my
20 years career.
Is it common for the police to simply ignore these big obvious problems and just assume, that everything he's telling you has gotta be correct ?
Jessie simply got confused.
You and I can tell the cops that we know what our rights are, basically go to hell, we're not gonna take this and walk out.
Jessie Misskelley has no concept of being able to leave a police station, the only thing that the prosecution has put on against Jessie is this wild story that he told the police, and I hope the fact that there's no physical evidence linking him to the crime scene is gonna have a lot of impact on the jury, we're talkin' about reasonable doubt.
I think you need to deal with lack of physical evidence, not just to let them get away with the fact that they were in the water and it all washed away.
A crime scene that clean has to be purposely planned, done that way.
The fact they looked washed down was not just happenstance...
Somebody intentionally...
Purposefully...
With great cunning and intelligence tried to get rid of...
Every spot of blood, semen, mud, footprint, anything that may have been there, they purposefully tried to get rid of all that.
An 18, 17, and a 16-yr-old kid, don't pull that off.
I think there's a lot of professional killers who don't leave it this clean.
I really do believe that if the jury hears what serial killers are like, and what they do and how they leave crime scenes, the missing evidence, the souvenirs,
I have know doubt there's a serial killer going around, that did these murders, he may be in Idaho now, but, I don't have any doubt about it.
It is somebody who knew what they were doing, had done it before, has probably done it since then, or will definitely do it again.
Are you aware of any personalty traits of people who are likely to falsely confess ?
Low I.Q.
Highly suggestible, always attempting to solve the immediate stress factor...
Get the interrogators off my back and just let me go home...
Naively assumes that they can all straighten it out later on.
It's extremely difficult for the average person to believe...
That someone would confess to a crime they didn't do, what I didn't like about this confession is that most of it emanated from questions right off the bat without any narrative of any length at all.
Without any descriptions about feelings, or conversations or anything,
I just don't understand, if he was involved in this crime how he made a mistake on the time factor.
And the thing that really bothers me is the ligature, what was used to tie up the victims, he certainly knows the difference between shoe laces and a rope, that should've been a signal that something was radically wrong.
That's when the questions should've been more probing to determine whether or not he was making it up or giving a valid confession.
Out of the 100 or more people that y'all talked to, are you aware of anybody other then than the defendant, who told you one of the victims that had their genitals removed and one of them had cuts to the side of the face, and there'd been some grabbing of the ears ?
There was no one else that mentioned those particular injuries, and, you yourself, you're pointing to the wrong side of the cheek.
Was there any kind of emotional response ?
He had tears coming down his eyes.
Had y'all yelled at him or been mean to him, or threatened him, or promised him anything, or any of those things ?
None of those things happened whatsoever.
Doctor, can you give us some examples of the police being coercive, leading or suggestive during the course of the interrogation ?
Yes, I can, perhaps the most powerful example, in my opinion, is the example of the eight revisiting of the question of the time at which the killings occurred.
The first example occurs on page three, det. Ridge says, "alright, when did you go with them ?"
Mr. Misskelley says,
"that morning", det. Ridge asks, "I'm not saying when they called you,
"I'm saying what time was it that you were actually there in the park ?"
Mr. Misskelley says,
"about noon."
Det. Ridge now says,
"okay, was it after school had let out ?"
This is immediately after Jessie saying
"it's at noon", he's now suggesting it must be later by saying, "is it after school let out ?"
Jessie says, "yes".
Det. Ridge follows up with his victory, on page 24, and this time det. Ridge says, and I quote,
"okay, the night
"you were in the woods,
"had you all been in the water ?"
Jessie replies,
"yeah, we'd been in the water,
"we were in it that night playing around in it."
This is the first time in the record, that it is directly suggested to Jessie, that the correct answer is
"this happened at night", immediately upon that being suggested,
Jessie...
Responds by accepting and you he starts to use the word "at night", where he had never used it before, that is an influence tactic, it is a way, of getting someone to accept something, out of pressure and out of suggestion.
But, that's one example, there are many other examples of manipulation on important points throughout this record.
Mr. ofshe, is your going rate approximately $300 an hour ?
No, that's not.
What is it ?
My rate is a $150 an hour for consultation, and $300 an hour for time spending in court or in deposition.
So if you're initially asked to evaluate a case, you don't get the $300 an hour unless you give an opinion that's consistent, with what the person asked you wants to hear.
They don't call you as a witness, you don't get your
$300 an hour, correct ?
Incorrect.
I don't know what the terminology is in Berkeley California, but...
When the defendant identified who it was who was castrated, when he indicated that one of the boys was cut in the face, you don't know and you can't give an opinion that any of those questions were coercive in nature ?
No, I can't because the record that we are dealing with is very incomplete, because this part of the record is preceded, as everyone agrees...
By over two hours of interrogation, in which many subjects were discussed, for which we have no record.

Jessie Misskelley, didn't tell the police anything that they didn't already know.
They led him him through this entire taped statement.
And ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we don't know what happened before they turned the tape recorder on.
They didn't videotape it, the officers didn't take notes on all the questions, they testified to that.
They even testified that they couldn't remember some of the things they asked him.
How do we know what really happened ?
The defense, through bringing in, so-called experts, such as Mr. Ofshe, have tried through smoke and mirrors to make it sound like, a person that confesses to such a heinous crime, and admits their involvement and gives you specific details in the involvement, that's indicative of someone, who was forced or coerced to confess.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, little Jessie Misskelley, is an innocent man.
He's innocent.
And I would ask you to go back to that jury room, and bring back a verdict that rings of justice, truth and justice, and I would ask you to bring back a verdict that you can live with for the rest of your life.
See this picture ?
This is the Moore boy.
This defendant won't look up, he won't look at you, but this defendant's actions, you just think about it, if this defendant does not chase down
Michael Moore...
If he does not run through the woods and chase him down and bring him back,
Michael Moore lives.
Michael Moore gets to go home at night, his parents get to be with him.
But, because of this defendant's actions...
Because of what
Jessie Misskelley Jr. did,
Michael Moore's dead,
Stevie branch is dead, and Chris Byers is dead, and there's no getting around it.
I think when you go back and you apply your common sense and you do what's right, and you think about the evidence in this case, you're gonna know that what the evidence shows is, that this defendant ran down Michael Moore, that this defendant was there, he was involved, and he's guilty of three counts of capital murder.
The jury went out at 4:20 this afternoon, they'll decide if
Jessie Misskelley is guilty in the deaths of
Christopher Byers,
Michael Moore and Steven branch.
Misskelley is charged with capital murder, and, if guilty, could get the death penalty.
Two other teen-agers charged in the crime, will be tried later this month in jonesboro.
In corning,
Wayne Hoffman,
 A.R.N. News.
Short but sweet.
Can't you twitch your nose and make them come back with a "not guilty" verdict ?
If I could twitch my nose and do that,
I'd have been gone a long time ago.
There's still hope.
I'm not giving up, though. don't ever ! don't get in there and get mad and go off...
They tell me, "how come he always keeps his head down ?"
Because I was told to keep my head down.
If you'd raise up and look around then, they'd be saying something else. don't let it bother you.
That's what they're saying about Damien, always stretchin' his neck, lookin' around.
Damien's a good kid.
I guess,
I don't know !
I didn't realize how much
I loved him until this.
I always loved him, but this is just-- well, thanks a lot !
You know
I always loved you,
I'm just sayin'
I didn't realize how much !
You're coming home.
You gotta get out of here.
Just say a prayer when the jury comes out.
'Cause we'll be sitting there sayin' one for you.
We hope we can carry you home.
It's kind of horrible.
You gotta learn to control it.
Alright, ladies and gentlemen in the audience,
I am acutely aware that...
You're...
Feelings are all on edge, that there's a great deal of emotion involved, but the court cannot tolerate and will not tolerate, any verbal outbursts, any display of emotion whatsoever, and I recognize that that's difficult and that's why
I'm warning you in advance.
The verdicts read as follows,
"we the jury find
Jessie Lloyd Misskelley Jr.
"Guilty of first degree murder
"in the death of Michael Moore,
"we the jury find
Jessie Lloyd Misskelley Jr.
"Guilty of second degree murder
"in the death of Stevie branch,
"we the jury find
Jessie Lloyd Misskelley Jr.
"Guilty of second degree murder
"in the death of Chris Byers, signed by
T.J. Williams, foreman."
Alright, Mr. Misskelley, if you could come around the front here and Dan,
Mr. Misskelley, did you hear the jury's finding and the reading of the verdict in your case ?
Yes, sir.
Do you have any legal reason or cause to tell the court why sentence should not be imposed at this time ?
I heard you but you need to answer out a little bit louder.
No, sir.
Alright, is there anything you wanna say before sentence is imposed ?
You have a right to make any statement you care to at this time.
Are you satisfied with the service and advice of your attorneys through this trial ?
Yes, sir.
Alright, based upon the jury's verdict, finding you guilty of first degree murder in the death of Michael Moore, you'll be sentenced to the
Arkansas dept. Of corrections for a term of life, in the count involving the death of Steven branch, the jury having found you guilty of second degree murder, you'll be sentenced to an additional term of 20 years, and in regard to the death of Christopher Byers, the jury having found you guilty of second degree murder, you will be sentenced to an additional term of 20 years in the Arkansas dept.
Of corrections, that is you will receive a life sentence plus 40 years.
It's hard to think of how it would've gone any other way, but you can never tell with a jury of 12, they could've found a verdict of not guilty, and we had to sit there and tell ourselves,
"god Grant us the Serenity
"to accept the things we cannot change
"the courage to change the things we can and the wisdom to know the difference."
So we had to be willing to accept what happened, and thankfully the verdict went our way.
There must be mixed emotions because you had the guilty verdict but you still have the loss to deal with.
This doesn't change anything.
Christopher's dead, and he was tortured to death by three murdering bastards on a ditch bank, he was 8 years old.
And guilty is guilty.
And I hope the little sucker, when he hits prison, they get his ass right off the bat !
Because he deserves to be tortured and punished for the rest of his life for murdering three
8 year old children !
How come you kept your head down the whole time ?
Jessie, anything you wanna say now ?
Did you do it,
Jessie ?
Did you do it, Jessie ?
How are you feeling right now ?
Prison's not a safe place.
Jessie, sweetie.
I'm gonna mail him a skirt.
One down two to go.
Hopefully the same thing will happen to the next two, and we'll get the same verdict.
They found my son's testicles in a jar of alcohol in Damien Echols' house, with his fingerprints on the jar.
Now, how do you dispute that ?
Some idiot started a rumor saying that they found umm...
Children's sexual parts under my bed or in my house.
And there was no body parts in my house.
I think maybe the police had something to do with it.
If they can make us look bad in front of the public, people are gonna kinda have their minds made up, before anything ever comes out.
We wanna talk to you about all this stuff in the paper about a deal with Jessie.
Right now we don't know what his situation is, although we think he is more inclined to testify right now than he has been at any point, up to now.
The Friday that
Jessie was convicted, by questioning, the officers that took him down inquired of him what had really happened, apparently, Jessie, contrary to somebody that was innocent, that would say things like,
"gee, I've just been convicted,
I didn't do it, what a terrible injustice",
Jessie talked all the way down there about how he committed the crime, and specific details, unfortunately we need his testimony real bad.
If it was a perfect world, we would take what we have on Jessie and leave it, and we'd go and get the other two, and get them and be happy, but it's not, and, we need his testimony to be sure we get convictions on the other two.
I think we're gonna negotiate his sentence down some in order to get him to testify.
He's not gonna testify just out of the goodness of his heart, the only way that
I think that he will be willing to testify, is if the life sentence is removed.
I do wanna say, all is not lost, if he doesn't testify, but the odds are reduced significantly.
We still got some evidence.
What we've got, besides Jessie, we got...
A fiber that was found on, it was found on Stevie's shirt, that matched the fiber from Jason Baldwin's mother, which is called secondary transfer.
We've got a fiber from a shirt, or a couple of fibers from a shirt found at Echols' house, found...
One of 'em was on
Michael's cub scout cap, another one maybe on the shirt, that matched Damien's.
Fiber evidence, in my opinion, is better than hair evidence, but they can't say that it came from that particular garment to exclusion of all others.
We've got the hollingsworth clan that says they saw Damien out on the service road, we've got some...
Kids that say that they heard him at a girl's softball game, overheard him say that he killed the three boys and he was gonna kill two more before he turned himself in.
They haven't scared them off, like they did the other ones ?
No, not yet.
We've got...
A guy that was in jail with Jason who says that
Jason made some incriminating statements to him, now, there are some things that they're gonna try to do to attack this kid's credibility.
Then we've got the knife that was found in the lake behind Jason's house, so, that's what we've got, but, that's all basically we got.
You asked what the odds were of convicting them without Jessie and it's 50-50, not be good.
The only way he'll come up there and sit down in that witness chair and testify, is if they cut him a sweet deal, you take all the things that are wrong with his statement and then add to that recipe mix, that I'm talkin' now because I got a sweet deal, and I'm gonna get out in 10 years, hypothetically,
I may get out in 10 years.
Heck, who wouldn't sing ?
You know what I'm saying ?
Then, his evidence, his statement, his whole thing looks bad, if that's their best evidence, and trust me, it is, if they can't use that statement against you, they got nothin'.
And this dog and pony show is over.
'Morning.
Are the rumor's false about Jessie turning ?
Is it true that
Jessie's gonna testify against Damien and Jason ?
That's false.
I just left Jessie at the jail and he told me that he was not gonna testify, he didn't want to get up there and lie, that the officers have been working on him real hard, but, he wasn't gonna listen to them, and his decision was final, but he can always change his mind again, he has, he's a very confused and scared kid, and the officers have scared him to death.
Last night I said, Jessie, if you get up there and lie,
I'm gonna be in that courtroom, and you're gonna have to sit there and tell that lie, when you know that I'm sitting there listening to you, when you know
I know that you are lying.
Damien, are you in a cult ?
Are you worried about Jessie testifying against you ?
In looking at young people involved in the occult, do you see any particular type of dress ?
I have personally observed people wearing black finger nails, having their hair painted black, wearing black t-shirts...
Sometimes they will tattoo themselves.
Do you have an opinion as to whether or not there are occult overtones, or evidence of occult involvement in these particular murders ?
Well, the date being close to...
 Belting...
A holiday, may 1, also...
The day before that is a holiday, then you go into the fact that some groups, occult, cult groups, will use a full moon.
In several occult books, they will talk about the life force of the blood.
Usually the younger the individual, the more pure it is.
The more power or force it has.
A lot of times they will take blood and store it for other services, and other use, as well as consume it, or bathe in it.
Now the...
Item that's drawn on the front, what is that ?
That is a pentagram, that happens to be a "wiccan", or white witchcraft pentagram.
Now, if you open the book to the front page.
Yes, sir.
Now...
Explain what that is.
That's confusion to me.
The reason why is we got a white witchcraft...
"Wiccan" pentagram, then we have upside-down crosses, which comes from another type of a occultism.
What type ?
That's black witchcraft.
Is it "Wicca", satanism, or both ?
Both.
And did you notice anything in particular about the book ?
There's a chapter in here called
"rise of the devil" and...
It is underlined in red.
And there are a couple of sentences in there, reference to blood, and it's life force.
How were you accepted into enrollment at Columbia pacific university ?
I had to fill out several series of papers including all my education, background, experience.
Did you ever fill out a little flyer like this ?
No, sir.
It says, "call toll-free for information on how to become a doctor ?"
This is a mail order college, isn't it ?
What classes did you take between 1980 and 1982 to obtain your master's degree ?
What classes ?
I testified--
I'm asking you, what classes did you take ?
I answered that before, none.
You did not take any classes, between 1982 and 1984 when you became a PH.d.
What classes did you take ?
None.
None, o.K.
Is it your opinion, and do you want to tell this jury...
That these crimes, were motivated by occult beliefs ?
Yes.
We're not trash, by no means, by son was born in west Memphis, he was raised in west Memphis, and for the life of me,
I cannot understand why people have got this bad imagine of him.
So what if he wore a black trench coat ?
He's not the only one that does.
So what if he wore black t-shirts, black pants ?
Johnny cash wears black, doesn't he ?
I wear black,
Michelle wears black, domini wears black !
We're all just partial to black, I guess.
I like black myself.
And, I'm by no means no devil worshiper, nor is he.
He was goin' to school, he wanted to go to school to be a priest, he was faithful in the church.
He looked into a little bit of "Wicca", but, he never went to it, and I think if people looked into what "Wicca" is they would understand it a little better.
The only thing wiccans do, is worship the earth.
People probably think that I'm into satanism because usually what people don't understand they try to destroy...
Or ridicule.
Try to make it look bad or wrong.
West Memphis is pretty much like second Salem.
Because everything that happens here, no matter what it is, it's blamed on satanism.
He's been previously sworn.
Correct.
Please state your name for the court.
Damien Wayne Echols.
Why did you change your name ?
I was very involved in the catholic church, and we were going over different names of the saints,
St. Michaels was where I went to church, and we heard about this guy from the Hawaiian islands, father Damien, that took care of lepers, until he finally caught the disease himself and died.
Was that the reason you choose
Damien as your first name ?
Yes, it is.
Did the choosing of the name "Damien" have anything to do with any type of horror movies, satanism, cultism, any of that nature ?
Nothing whatsoever.
After the time period that you were really into the catholic religion, did you start focusing on another particular religion ?
"Wicca".
Could you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury some principals about the Wicca religion ?
It acknowledges a goddess in a higher regard as a god, because people have always said we are all god's children, and men cannot have children.
It's basically like a close involvement with nature.
Is there a difference between the Wicca religion and witchcraft ?
Wicca is also called "witchcraft", the word "Wicca" was bastardized, it originally meant "wise one".
Did the fact that you like to wear black all the time, were you different in other ways as well ?
Yes, I've never had a lot of the same interests that other people have, like sports, things like that,
I've never been into anything like that.
Did it help you deal with other people to have people kind of stand-offish and sort of back away from you ?
Yeah, it was like a defense mechanism, it would make people think like, well he's weird
I'm not gonna go around him, so, it kept people away.
The state introduced the book
"never on a broomstick", are you familiar with that particular book ?
Yes, I am.
Where did you get that book, Damien ?
At the library, all the books that they were gettin' tired of or had for a long time, they had them sittin' on a rack out front, that they were selling for 10 cents each, so I got it.
Did you underline any of those portions in the book ?
That was done when I got it,
I think it was because somebody had a report to do,
'cause all during the book there's little notes, certain dates and stuff, like from the 1600's in the outside margin.
So was that book kind of like a history of witchcraft and how it's developed over the ages ?
Yes.
Are you familiar with the contents of that notebook ?
Yes, I am.
I noticed on the inside of the front cover there appears to be a couple of quotes there, could you read each of those to the jury and tell them where that came from ?
"Life is but a walking shadow,
"it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing."
That's from a
"midsummer's night's dream", by William Shakespeare.
"Pure black looking clear,
"my work is soon done here, try getting back from me, that which used to be."
That is off a Metallica tape, called "and justice for all", talks about how warped the court systems are, and stuff like that.
On may the 5th...
Did you kill
Michael Moore ?
No, I did not.
On may the 5th, did you kill
Stevie branch ?
No, I did not.
On may the 5th, did you kill
Chris Byers ?
No, I did not.
Have you ever participated in any type of human sacrifice ?
No, I have not.
19 year old
Damien Echols admits he stands out in a crowd.
He says he loves heavy metal music--
19 year old
Damien Echols says--
19 year old Damien Echols admits he stands out in a crowd.
He says he likes to wear black most of the time, practices the "Wicca" religion, and loves heavy metal music, but he says he's definitely not a killer.
I believe they did it, and if they were to be set free on the street, then they would have to look behind their back, watch behind their back, to see if Pam Hobbs wouldn't follow 'em.
Because I'm just saying this as a human.
I would,
I believe I'd try to kill them two, if they ever walked the street, and I'm still alive.
I believe
I'd be stalking them.
To do to them...
Probably shoot 'em, and then cut 'em up.
When I was down at the courtroom and Damien walked past me,
I wanted to go over there, and take my hand and just claw down his face, inflict any kind of pain, that I could inflict on him.
I know, eventually, we're gonna have to forgive 'em,
I understand that, but when it happens in your home and you watch your wife lose her mind, and whatever happened to her, your home is tore apart and busted up,
I don't feel it's fair right now, for someone to ask me to forgive the ones that caused it.
It'll take some time, a long time, before I could forgive 'em.
You say that it's gonna take time, we don't know how much time we got, and we wouldn't be able to see Stevie again, we have to forgive in our heart, because the lord, forgave us, he forgave us, he shedded his blood for us.
He shedded his blood for them.
And he just asked us to have a...
Forgiving spirit.
Now, I refuse, to serve sin and Satan.
Because I'm gonna see Stevie again,
I'm gonna be with Stevie again,
I'm gonna be with my mother again.
I'm gonna be with your grandmother, both of them.
I'm gonna be with all of my loved ones, that have passed on and went to heaven.
If you could speak to the families...
Of these kids who think you did it, what would you say to them ?
I don't know.
Jason was my best friend, we did about everything together.
It was kind of like we even lived together most of the time, stayed at each others houses, wore each other's clothes.
It was more like we were brothers.
We used to go out and snake hunt all the time.
Snakes and music were about our whole life really.
We were all the time lookin' for new groups, that we would like.
Our favorite kinds of music were like slayer,
Metallica, megadeth.
 U2... 
Would we would do just about everything together.
I wanna draw your attention back to August of last year, were you were in the craighead juvenile detention facility ?
Yes, I was.
And what were you in there for at the time ?
Burglary.
And, when you were there, was there a Jason Baldwin in the juvenile detention facility at the same time ?
Yes.
While you were in contact with this Jason Baldwin, was there anything mentioned about his involvement in the murders of the three eight year olds ?
Yes, we were sitting there playing spades and I wanted to get to know everybody off in there,
I don't know what you'd call it, but, I just wanted to get to know him, and I just straight out asked him if he did it and he denied it the first time.
Did you have an occasion again while you were there to ask him was he involved in the murders of the three eight year olds ?
Yes.
I think it was like the next day.
I believe it was the next day.
And can you tell us what was going on, what was happening at the time that occurred ?
Me and Jason were scrapin' up the cards, goin' to our cells for lunch, and I said, "just between me and you, I won't say a word, did you do it ?"
And he said "yes", and he went into detail.
What did he tell you ?
He told me how he dismembered the kid, or I don't know exactly how many kids, he just said he dismembered 'em, he sucked the blood from the penis and scrotum, and put the balls in his mouth.
Now Michael, when was it that you...
Came forward with this information ?
I'm not really sure,
I believe it was like a couple of months later.
What caused you to come forward at that point in time, why did Michael Carson no longer wanna stay uninvolved, why did you come forward in February this year ?
'Cause I saw the family on TV,
I saw how broken-hearted they were about their children being missing, and I got a soft heart,
I couldn't take it.
Now, he tells you this and then you're silent...
From August, until February, is that right ?
Yes, sir.
And in the second conversation you've ever had with this young man in his entire life he tells you all this stuff ?
Yes, sir.
After he's had
 one conversation with you.
Yes, sir.
One day when
I was up here workin', the phone rings, secretary says, you won't know who he is but he needs to talk to you,
I pick up the phone, he says I'm Danny Williams,
I'm embarrassed to tell you what I need to tell you, he said but I work with the juvenile department here, and I do drug and alcohol counseling, and there's a guy named Michael Carson who's gonna testify that
Jason confessed to him in jail and I know he's lying.
I said, what are you talkin' about ?
He said, well, several months ago,
Michael Carson was one of the kids that I worked with, and...
He and I had a conversation where I told him that this Jason Baldwin had been accused of killing three boys and sexually mutilating them.
And basically, he gave Michael Carson the details that he testified to at the trial.
At the time
Carson says nothing...
And then Carson later tells him,
"hey, by the way Danny,
"I'm tellin' the police that Jason confessed to me", so he calls me up and says no, no, this kid's a liar, he's no good,
I know he's lying, and the only reason he's got this information is because
I gave it to him.
The counselor of this kid called the prosecution and told 'em what a liar he was and the prosecution still used the kid, and now they're tryin' to keep out the fact the background of the kid.
Obviously we wanna get that information out but the judge acts like he might not let us use it at all.
We should absolutely be able to let that jury know that he is
 LSD dependent, because it does effect his ability to recall.
The judge takes all that away from us and says, the kid looks pretty believable.
Not only are they keeping out the background of the kid when he testifies, so the jury doesn't have all the eggs, but now they're keeping out the counselor, who even knows about this kid, who told him the story in the first place, prior to him ever telling the police.
All that goes to the credibility.
I think that would've shown the jury that he doesn't have quite that kind heart.
That soft heart.
Det. Allen, I want to direct your attention to November the 17th, 1993, were you asked to make contact with some property owners at lakeshore trailer park, and also get with the Arkansas state police dive team ?
Yes, sir I was.
And after a period of time of...
Searching, do you know whether any items were recovered ?
Yes, sir.
Mark for identification purposes, the state's exhibit 77, and I ask if you can identify that.
Yes,
I can identify this by my...
"11-17 of '93, m. Allen", that I put here.
Where did you get the knife ?
I got this knife from the diver with the state police.
How long did this search take ?
"How long ?"
From memory, I'm thinking, maybe 10:30 A.M.
Is the time they got suited up and started to look.
You quit at when ?
They located the...
Knife, at 11:35 A.M.
About an hour.
About an hour-- are you telling this jury that this knife is the murder weapon ?
Is that what you're tellin' this jury ?
No, sir, I'm not telling the jury that.
Okay, now that we understand that.
What day were these individuals charged ?
What did day did y'all charge Damien Echols with this crime ?
Was it June the third ?
Yes, sir.
And what day was it that you were out there searching this lake ?
This was on
11-17 of '93.
November 17 of 1993 ?
Yes, sir.
That's all.
As long as they get an arrest, they don't care.
The damn system stinks !
They're playing with our lives, and there's nothing right about it.
It's kind of like the Nazi's, they can just take somebody's word and come in your house, and take you away.
And basically that's what they did because of what
Jessie told them, even though it had all those inconsistencies in it.
If we had money, do you think these 3 boys would've been picked up ?
They found people they knew didn't have Ne the boys have been in a little bit of trouble, they thought we didn't care, they were wrong.
They're bad wrong.
I don't believe that children could be that cold-blooded, as what happened to those boys.
On the state's exhibit, 67-a, it shows the...
Hog-tying fashion, the hands were hog-tied, to the feet, behind the back, and this is the photograph, showing the shoe laces...
That injury, you say, is typical of a belt injury, the belt has a little buckle, and that's one that goes back and forth left to right, that's the base of the latch.
Here, this red area here, this is the shaft of the penis, and here is where the scrotal sac and testes should be and they're missing.
So what we have is the skin overlying the penis, the head of the penis, has been carved off, it's gone, it's not there.
In layman's language, that I understand, with respect, his penis has not been cut off, has it ?
No, the skin has been taken off the penis.
And basically it would take some skill and precision to do that, wouldn't it ?
I would think so.
If this was to be done, this dissection, where the skin is cut off, that would take a very sharp instrument would it not ?
I think it would.
Such as a razor.
Or a sharp knife.
A very sharp knife, doctor, if you were to do this, with the skill and precision and knowledge that you take, how long would it take you to do that ?
It would take me some time.
It would take you longer than 5 to 10 minutes ?
I would think so.
And that's in your lab.
I would think so.
With a scalpel.
Is that correct ?
That's correct.
Now, doctor if we added to the equation that you were in the dark, could you do this in the dark ?
You, doctor, could you do it in the dark ?
It'd be difficult.
Could you do this in the water ?
You, doctor, could you do this in the water ?
I think it would be very difficult to do.
If you were doing it in the dark, in the water, with mosquitoes all around you.
Would that make it even much more difficult ?
I would think so.
It would be a very tedious task for you, a skilled pathologist.
It would.
Now, isn't it true, doctor, that people have about
5 pints of blood ?
A little more than that, yes.
Okay, now, if I poured out five pints of blood out here on on the floor, it would make a big mess, wouldn't it ?
Yes.
And it would be almost impossible to clean up.
You can do it but, not very easily.
It's not easy to clean blood.
Does blood soak into the ground ?
Yes, it does.
Doctor, with this homicide, we're talking about here today, would you agree with me that, this could've happened in one of three ways, these injuries could've happened in the water, these injures could've happened on the bank, or could've happened somewhere else.
Would you agree with me those are the three possibilities of how this could've happened ?
Yes.
Now, with your knowledge of the amount of blood that was lost, from, not only Chris Byers, but these other boys, they're gonna bleed as well, won't they ?
Oh, yes.
Do you have an opinion as to whether or not you could clean up that amount of blood ?
At a scene, in the dark ?
Do you have an opinion as to that ?
I think it would be quite difficult to do, to have...
Injuries of this nature, without having any blood...
I would question that about the blood.
Unless it happened in the water or it happened some other place.
And you again, doctor, stated that you couldn't do this in the water ?
Personally,
I don't think I could.
I don't get off on hurtin' people, or inflicting pain on the rest of the human race, or just...
Causing destruction for the purpose of destruction.
I've probably been in one or two fights my entire life.
And especially a child...
Because they didn't do anything to deserve what they got.
And I believe whatever you do to someone else, whether it's good or bad, is eventually gonna come back around to you.
Even the person who did this, if they're not caught and punished, something will happen in their life where they will be punished.
People kept tellin' me not to go out with Damien because he was like some kind of devil worshiper, and I met him in Wal-Mart...
And he followed me around like a puppy dog...
And we started talking and he was real sweet, not like everybody else was making him out to be, that night we starting going out, and it was like a month, and he called me up on the telephone at my dad's girlfriend's house and he goes,
"will you marry me ?"
And I'm like, "what ?!"
And he goes,
"will you marry me ?"
I said, "can you repeat that one more time ?!"
And he goes,
"will you marry me",
I said, "yeah", and when I got pregnant
I had this big picture painted in my mind,
Damien's gonna be there, and I get to yell at him when I have the baby.
And instead
I was yelling at<I> her.</I>
I miss him so much.
And he hasn't yet to see the baby, they won't let him touch the baby.
It makes me so pissed off.
I felt different when he was born it was-- it made me feel like,
I guess just real good inside...
To think that I gave life to another human being.
Something completely separate from me but still part of me.
I just hope that I'll be there when he grows up.
To watch him.
You are familiar with a fellow named
 aleister Crowley ?
I know who he is.
He's the guy who kindly professes, he's a noted author in the field of satanic worship.
I know he is but I never saw any of his books, personally.
You're not really much of a follower of his ?
I would've read 'em if I would've saw 'em, but, I just never...
But, Aleister Crowley, is a guy that based on his writings, believes in human sacrifice, doesn't he ?
He also believed he was god, though.
And he also had writings that indicated that children were the best type of human sacrifice, correct ?
Yes, sir.
But, Aleister Crowley doesn't have any particular significance to you ?
I know who he is,
I've read a little bit about him, but, I never read anything by him.
Let me show you a copy of documents, do you recognize that ?
Yes.
What is that ?
It was this paper I had on different alphabets for like translations, where you can write things that nobody could read, and this was one of the forms.
Oh, okay, where'd you have that at ?
When did you write those things out ?
Some time before
I was arrested I guess.
Are you sure that you hadn't done those since you were arrested while you been staying in jail ?
I don't know,
I might have.
Who's names are written on that document ?
Mine, Jason's, my son's, one that says
Aleister Crowley-- wait, wait !
Who ?
Aleister Crowley.
This is a document that you've written while you've been waiting in jail for trial, right ?
If you say so.
You wrote it, it's your writing ?
Mm-hmm.
Do you recall when you wrote it ?
Not really.
What I'm gonna ask you is, that this Damien Echols, your son, he wasn't born until after you were placed in jail, correct ?
Yes.
So if you've got his name listed on this document, then this document had to be generated after he was born ?
Yes.
So this is something you've written since you've been sitting in here in jail waiting for trial.
Yes.
And what you were doing was writing out various names in different types of alphabets, correct ?
From the way it looks here
I was practicing, trying to memorize them.
And one of the names that you picked out to write about was this fella named
Aleister crowely, correct ?
Mm-hmm.
Is that just a total coincidence, you just pulled his name out of the air ?
No, it's the same book that I had with the different alphabets and it also had stuff about him in there.
Did you have the book out at the time you were doing this ?
This was just from what
I remembered myself,
I was practicing, trying to memorize, get it all in my head.
So you were going over it and working on it, and at that point in time, you write all this down from memory ?
Mm-hmm.
The people that are listed here, you got your name on here, right ?
Mm-hmm.
And Jason Baldwin, which is your best friend, right ?
And then you got
Damien Seth Echols, that's your son ?
Yes, it is.
And the only other name on this document, besides yourself, your best friend, and your son, is Aleister Crowley, correct ?
Yes, sir.
I believe this witness has requested not to be photographed.
That's correct, your honor.
Would you state your name for the jury ?
Christi vanbickle.
Do like you just did and speak up best you can, okay ?
Are you nervous ?
Yes.
Did you hear somebody say something about the murder of the three little boys ?
Yes, I heard Damien Echols say that he killed the three boys.
Where were you, was he sayin' that to you, what were you doin' ?
I was walking by with my friend.
Christi,
I'm Scott Davidson,
I've got a couple of questions to ask you too, okay ?
First of all, do you remember what day this was that you heard this ?
No, sir.
That's the first time you'd ever seen him in your life ?
Yes, sir.
What did he say
 before he said he killed those three boys, what did he say before that ?
I don't know.
What did he say after that ?
I don't know.
And how close were you to him ?
I wasn't close.
Did he scream it ?
I don't know.
Did he yell it ?
I don't know.
Call Jody medford.
Again, this witness has requested not to be photographed.
Jody, I want to direct your attention to may of 1993, after the murders of the three little boys.
Did you have occasion to be at the softball field and hear a comment in regard to the murders ?
Yes, sir.
Tell the jury first, what you heard.
He said
"I killed the little boys
"and before I turn myself in
I'm gonna kill two more, and I already have one of 'em picked out."
You didn't recognize anybody else that was with him ?
I saw Jason Baldwin there.
Had you heard people talking about Damien before this ?
Yes, sir.
Did you think, do you think he was kind of weird or something ?
Yes, sir 'cause he was dressed all in black and his hair was jet black and long and shaved on the side.
Two teen-age girls took the stand this morning and they said they heard
Damien Echols confess to the murders of three
8 year old boys last may, one of the girls said she overheard Damien Echols say,
"I killed the three boys, and I'm going to kill two more,
I already have one picked out."
Later in the afternoon, when the defense began presenting it's witnesses,
Damien Echols, himself took the stand, he said he thought the girls were lying and that they were making up those statements.
He also said he did not practice satanism, and denied any involvement in the murders of Chris Byers,
Michael Moore and Stevie branch.
Were you working at Bojangles restaurant on the evening of may 5th of 1993 ?
Yes, sir.
Could you tell us what happened ?
Well, it was about
9:30 at night,
I found a black gentleman sitting in the in the woman's restroom on the commode, and there was blood dripping off of his forearm, but, he had mud on his feet, and he seemed to be disarrayed when
I talked to him.
I called the police then.
What happened then ?
It was a female officer for the west Memphis police, and she pulled on the lot and I saw her coming so, I went up to the front door.
She kept comin' around, she went to the drive through window.
You did not go in the restaurant ?
No, sir, I did not.
Did you ever find this bleeding black man ?
No, sir, I did not.
Do you have a report that you made regarding this incident ?
No, sir,
I do not.
And you're out looking for some boys, you're out in that area and you hear about someone bleeding, did anything go through your mind thinking, something may be going on ?
You gotta understand, it's a different area I went to, it was a different ward,
I did not connect the two at all.
It may have been outside your ward, but, distance-wise between the area where you were looking and where this restaurant was, it's not a long distance, is it ?
No, sir, it's really not.
Did any other officer come out there that evening ?
Not that evening.
Were you working on the day of may 6th of 1993 ?
Yes, sir, two detectives came out and they took a report as far as what I'd seen, description of the gentleman, and then they took blood scrapings off the wall.
What is the date that you sent the blood scrapings off to the crime lab to be analyzed ?
They were never sent.
They were never sent ?
That's correct.
Where are the blood samples at this time ?
I don't know, they're lost.
That's my mistake,
I lost a piece of evidence.
Most of the time he came up with the stupid ideas.
I guess I influenced him about as much as he influenced me.
Most of the time we didn't really, set out to do anything in particular.
We just starting hanging around, whatever happened just usually happened.
Sometimes good, sometimes bad.
We're just sitting on the couch watching TV the night we were arrested.
Pigs busted in, starting runnin' all over the house.
We tried to hide in the bedroom when the cops first came.
They wouldn't leave !
We were in the bedroom, turned the light off, maybe they'll go away.
I know you're in there, open up !
We saw all the lights go out.
And Domini turned 'em back on.
No, it was my sister.
The interesting thing about it is the one knife, that we know somebody owns is the byers' knife.
We know he owns that knife.
He's got the motive, his son who he's upset with, his son was the only one mutilated, the other two weren't mutilated, he's got knowledge about the area, he knows when the search is over with, he's big enough that he can carry the boys there and throw them in, he's a jeweler, he's precise enough to have committed that mutilation, all of the pieces fit together with somebody in a different location, killing the boys in a different location, because there's no mosquito bites on 'em, so we know that after the boys were killed, and during, they weren't outside.
They had to be inside 'cause there's no bites on 'em.
So that means they were carried from a death scene someplace, unconscious, and brought down to the river, and they had to be killed shortly before they were brought down there, because they all died within a short period of time.
So after they were bled to death, after they were bludgeoned, and unconscious, somebody had to take those three, take 'em to the scene, and dump 'em.
In order to do that, you gotta be physically strong enough to carry an unconscious kid...
Who's hog-tied.
Jason couldn't have done it, in his best day, he couldn't carry a little baby, with those little skinny arms of his.
So when we look at this whole thing, all the pieces that they tried to put together, none of it fits with Jason and just about all of it fits towards a person like byers.
When did you receive that knife ?
I believe it was on the 8th,
I've got-- it's hard to make this out,
"January the 8th, 1994."
Alright, and, who did you receive this knife from ?
I received it from...
How did i actually receive it ?
No, who did you receive the knife from ?
I received it from...
Joe and the people with hbo productions.
O.K.
Bruce and...
Wherever he is.
Upon receiving that knife, what did you do with it ?
I saw what i thought to be some type of substance on the knife, and naturally I did not know what it was,
I, in turn, sent this knife to genetic design.
When the knife was received by your firm, did you or your lab, run tests on that particular knife ?
There was a small amount of what appeared to be blood that was dried, or tissue in a crevice on the knife, where the knife folds when it locks.
The results of the test showed us that there was DNA present on the knife, and that we were able to get a type, using a test called
"hla-dq Alpha".
And Mr. byers had the same type that was detected from the specimen from the knife.
Okay, and what was the "dq-Alpha" type for Christopher byers ?
It was also the same type.
So, the blood on the knife, and Christopher byer's blood, and John mark byer's blood all had the same type.
Correct.
Judge, if I can approach the witness ?
Alright.
Take a look at that knife.
I will call that, for identification purposes, the "John mark byers' knife".
Doctor, did you make a comparison with this knife,
"e-6", and compare that with some of the wounds that you found on Chris byers ?
Yes, I did.
Does that knife appear to be a serrated knife ?
Yes, this is a serrated knife.
Do you have an opinion if some of the wounds that you found on Chris byers were consistent with wounds which would've been caused by that type of serrated knife ?
Some of the wounds that have the smaller serrated patterns, could have been inflicted with a knife having this type of serration.
How do you think this has gone over so far on the mark byers' aspect ?
Obviously we thought long and hard about mentioning a father as a possible suspect.
I hate having to do that, but the way the circumstances are, it's just coming out whether we want it to or not.
We had suspicions even before the knife showed up.
Do you think anybody realizes the reason for the three day delay in Jessie's trial was waiting on that DNA test to come back on byers' knife ?
I doubt it, and even after the results came back, and it showed that it could be mark's blood, as well as Chris' blood, that doesn't alleviate the fact that he said no one had ever cut themself on the knife.
And it shouldn't have had blood on it at all.
Do you think the argument at least that it wasn't that the blood was found on the blade, which could be easily wiped off, but it was back in the hinges that you normally wouldn't think if you were wipin' off the blood, you wouldn't think the blood would be inside the hinges, and that's where they found that particular blood.
How do we get that in ?
Just ask gitchell ?
Ask byers, we can put byers up on the stand.
I think the jury expects to see him now.
They wanna see what he has to say, don't you think so ?
I think so.
Mr. byers, i need to ask you about, defense exhibit number "e-6", this particular folding lock-blade knife.
If I can approach the witness your honor ?
Yes.
Take a look at that knife, please.
Had that knife ever been used before ?
Used for what ?
Used for any purpose ?
I had...
Trimmed me toenails with it,
I had attempted to trim on some venison that I had.
You attempted
"to trim on some venison", when was it that you attempted to trim on some venison ?
Some time around the Thanksgiving holidays.
Do you recall being asked on January the 26th, this is on page 3, by insp. Gitchell,
"had you ever taken that knife hunting, or used it recently ?"
Do you remember being asked that question by gitchell ?
Specifically, no, sir, he asked me a lot of questions.
Do you remember giving the answer "no,
"that knife had not been used at all,
"it had just been kept up, put in my dresser,
"and I didn't use it, and the reason why was because of the serrated edges."
Do you recall giving that answer to gitchell on the 26th ?
No, sir, i don't recall giving him that exact answer.
I'm sure his question wouldn't have been asked exactly like your question.
Did gitchell tell you,
"let me explain a problem we had,
"and you need to answer this from me, we have found blood on this knife", did gitchell ask you that question ?
I don't remember if he said there was or not.
Did you tell gitchell you had no idea how Chris' blood could be on that knife ?
Yes, sir, I would not have any idea, if his blood was on that knife,
I would not know how it got there.
Did you have any idea how human blood was on that knife ?
Yes, I would have an idea,
I cut my thumb.
Alright, isn't it true that you never told gitchell on jan. 26th that you ever cut your thumb with that particular knife, did you ?
Yes, sir, it seems like during the course of the day
I did tell him that.
Was that during the taped conversation or was that after ?
I don't remember.
Okay, on the top of page 8, do you recall being asked the question,
"i have no idea, no idea,
"how it could have any human blood on it", do you recall giving that answer ?
Yes, sir.
Then do you recall stating,
"i don't even remember nicking myself with it, cutting the deer meat or anything."
Is that the answer you gave ?
Yes, sir.
And is that the truth ?
At the time when he was questioning me,
I might not have remembered, we were getting ready to go into a trial...
Did you remember on this date cutting yourself with the venison, or not cutting yourself ?
The date that
Gary questioned-- yes, sir.
I might not have remembered it at that time, when he was questioning me, but, I could have remembered it later on in the day and talked to him about it.
Earlier that afternoon, had you given
Chris a whipping ?
Approximately around 5:30.
About 5:30, was this with a belt ?
Yes, sir.
How many times did you hit him with the belt ?
I spanked him two or three times.
And what part of the body did you spank him ?
It would've been just on his behind.
Was he wearing his paints, or did you have him pull his pants down ?
No, he had on blue jeans.
The judge back there during that last recess before you were recalled here, says that you have a brain tumor and you're being treated, do you wanna talk about that, is it true ?
It's been rumored.
Yes, I have a brain tumor.
And you're being treated ?
Yes, I'm being treated for it.
I need to ask you one question and I hope you won't get angry, but has even the suggestion that you may have had something to do with the murders of these boys caused any problems within your family or with any of the other victim's families ?
No.
They all the know the truth and, no.
Did you have anything to do with these boy's deaths ?
No more than you did.
Someone said you're buying a new house, that you're leaving west Memphis ?
I didn't say that.
We might try to move.
Out of west Memphis ?
Well, somewhere,
 you would probably wanna move.
You know ?
Did you say where you were gonna move ?
No.
Let me ask you a question, would you wanna live in a house that your baby died less than
3/4 of a mile from ?
I wouldn't, no.
That answers the question.
You're talking about your whole family, right ?
You're not just talking about you ?
You wouldn't move and leave your wife and children somewhere would you ?
Not if we were gonna stay together.
O.K.
Some of the questions you ask are kind of ridiculous, some of 'em are kinda odd or strange or different, how ever you'd like to comment on 'em, but, some of 'em seem like you just use a little common sense and think about what you would do or how you would feel.
Some of the questions you wouldn't have to ask.
We have to ask them, we can't quote ourselves.
I know, but a lot of times things are printed in the paper that people did not say and the news media,
I'm not stating which individual, says they got it from a confidential informer, and you don't like to turn your confidential informer over, when you're confidential informer is your imagination.
There's a lot of things that printed in the paper that people did not say.
But the media has the rights to print what they wanna print.
Victims don't have any rights.
Now that I've heard him talk...
I kinda had an idea of what he was like before he talked, but after he talked he wasn't anything like i thought he would be.
How is he ?
I see him now as more like a human being than I did before.
Now I see him as having a personality.
From a defense standpoint,
I've never been a defense attorney, but, to put him on the witness stand, sure seems to be an awful big gamble.
I can't understand that mindset that puts you in the position where you're willing to take that gamble.
Especially when you follow it up with Mr. bojangles' accusations.
It didn't make any sense.
'Cause to me, if I were on the jury, it would look like something desperate, they're gonna cast blame on anybody and everybody they can.
And the defense didn't have the the guts to actually ask him did he do it ?
The song that I really can relate to by metallica is "sanitarium".
'Cause I feel like all those times I was put in the hospital
I didn't need it.
It was just the police, another way for them setting me up, when they couldn't send me to prison.
We'll get him out of our way for a little while, by sending him somewhere else.
I like metallica because, well, all...
Hard music like that, because, it gives me an adrenaline rush.
Makes me feel more alive.
Now during the course of, talking to Mr. echols, did you ask him, who did he think did it and why ?
In one area he says he had an opinion for who could've done the murders, as being someone sick, and it was some type of thrill kill, he also stated that the penis was a symbol of power in his religion, known as "wicca", he also stated that the number 3 has a sacred number in the belief.
Did he tell you anything about demonic forces ?
Yes, he said that all people have a demonic force in them and that a person would have no control over that demonic force.
Mr. echols was not the only person that told you that the kids probably died of mutilation, was he ?
No, sir.
And, when, Mr. echols, you asked him, what type of books did he enjoy reading ?
Yes, sir.
Um...
And he told you
Anton Levy and Stephen king ?
Yes, sir.
In your opinion is there anything unusual about those being the type of books that he likes ?
Anton Levy, is a book of satanic rules and involvement.
Stephen king's seems to be horror movies, horror books.
You're asking if I felt that was strange, yes I did.
Now let me refer you back to your statement that you gave officer Ridge.
Did you tell him in that statement that you had been a member of a white witch group for 5 years ?
No.
I've never been a member of any group.
If he put that in his report you're saying that's inaccurate.
Yes, I am.
He made that up.
Yes I am.
On question number nine, how do you think the person feels that did this ?
The answer was,
"probably makes them feel good, gives them power."
Now, I guess officer Ridge said that too.
No, I used common sense on that.
If someone was doing it, they must've wanted to, and if they were doing something they wanted to it must've made them happy.
I don't think they were doin' it
'cause someone forced them to or because they didn't want to.
So, in your mind...
The person that killed these three kids, it's common sense that killing three 8 years olds would make you feel good.
Whoever did it, it must have.
Did you also tell him that each person had a demonic side to them ?
I believe every person has a good side and a bad side.
Were those your words, what he's got written down here, you stated that that there was no control of the demonic force in a people ?
He asked me did I think there were some people that could not control that side,
I said yes, i guess there is.
It also states that you stated that the younger the victim would mean more innocent, and in turn more power would be given the person doing the killing.
Right.
Did you say that ?
Yes.
Those are your words.
Did you pick that up when studying to be a catholic ?
No.
I saw that on several movies, books.
Question #11, when he asked you, how do you think they died, the answer is,
"mutilation, cut up all three,
"heard they were in the water drowning, cut up one more than the others..."
Is that again what officer Ridge said and you just agreed ?
No, I saw that on TV, newspapers, people talkin'.
And...
You knew about the drowning, correct ?
I knew that they were in the water,
I didn't know that they drowned.
You knew that one was cut up more than the others ?
He said, "do you think one was hurt worse than the others ?"
Oh, so again, that particular area's, one of those things where officer Ridge told you and that wasn't your response, you just responded about the drowning and mutilation.
If he didn't get the answer he liked, he would go back and try to get me to say something else.
And it's your testimony, specifically, that you weren't the one who said that one was cut up more than the other, that it was officer Ridge who said that.
I agreed with him when he said that.
And if he says something different, he'd be lying about it, right ?
You're the one tellin' the truth.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Damien, we're getting close to the end now.
How do you feel so far ?
I feel good so far.
To me it looks like we got it beat.
What do you think the worst thing for us has been ?
In the three weeks we've been here, what has hurt the most ?
I only know of two things that have really hurt, that one kid gettin' up there for Jason, and those girls.
The Thursday's newspaper which addressed you testifying on Wednesday, was real good, it talked about that you did well, but Friday's, regarding your thurday testimony wasn't as good, what do you think ?
I think I did real good the first day, the second day it didn't look as good, because they kept trying to trip me up or something.
There was one point in there where he asked you he says "it looks like your just changin' your story, to fit whatever comes up", and you said "yeah".
I was just like halfway listening to him.
I was real nervous when I first got up there, enough to keep my attention focused, after I was up there a few minutes,
I just started day dreaming.
"Day dreaming".
Maybe they'll only halfway kill you when they convict you.
"Halfway" ?
How do they do that ?
I don't know, maybe they'll start day dreaming.
Anything wrong with wearing black in and of itself ?
No.
Anything wrong with the heavy metal stuff ?
No...
The book, anything wrong with that ?
No, but when you look at it together, you begin to see inside
Damien echols, you see inside that person, and you look inside there and there's not a soul in there.
My client is a teen-ager, and we certainly didn't hide that fact from ya.
And the fact that my client did some writings, take these back, go back and read 'em, but this, in and of itself, is no evidence of murder, and even if you added all the other things,
"trappings of occultism", according to
Dr. griffis, that has nothing to do with this case whatsoever.
Is it a coincidence...
That this knife is found, in the lake, hidden...
Behind Jason Baldwin's house ?
There are marks on Christopher byers, where you got like a dash, where it's a cut, a cut, an open space, a cut, an open space.
And if you take this knife and you do that, you can see it leaves a cut and an open space, a cut and an open space.
Now, if you take...
 This knife...
Exhibit...
Defense exhibit six...
And even with the slightest pressure, it makes a straight line.
Crime scene...
It doesn't fit for a kid to bleed to death, and not leave a drop behind.
For all the other injuries to their faces, these other injuries are gonna bleed too.
And there's not a drop of blood ?
Not a drop of blood ?
Look at history, look at hundreds of years of religious history.
There have been hundreds of people killed in the name of religion.
It is a motivating force, it gives people who want to do evil, want to commit murders, a reason to do what they're doing.
Satanic panic.
Yeah, that's a scary thing.
It's a scarier thing to convict someone with no evidence, if you can't figure it out, if it doesn't make sense, let's call it a cult killing, and find somebody weird !
Find somebody who wears black !
But, they let one thing go by the wayside...
Is that there's nothing that links Jason to these activities.
Not one witness says,
"that's what he does, that's his beliefs".
We don't have a writing, a drawing, a picture, not a person, nothing...
Links him to it.
But that doesn't matter.
That doesn't matter to them !
Because he's sittin' over there with Damien, they want you to convict him.
Guilt by association is a horrible thing.
Damien, do you think he looks like you ?
I don't know, not really.
I think he's got domini's ears.
Can you change his diapers, Damien ?
Do you think you'll be spending more time with your child ?
I hope.
C'mon, Damien, it's time.
What's his first words gonna be, "not guilty" ?
His first words will be
"capital murder".
What's it feel like to go through a month long trial accused of something you didn't do ?
Horrible.
Are you nervous now ?
Yeah.
There's nothin' we can do now but sit around and wait, but, you got anything you wanna ask me ?
Where do we go when the jury comes back out and says
I'm not guilty ?
Where do you wanna go ?
 Disneyland maybe.
Would you like to go to Disneyland ?
Have you ever been on a trip at all ?
 The Springs.
Well I tell you what, my man, it would be a Joy to take you.
Would you like to go ?
Yeah.
Do you understand now why we didn't want you to testify ?
Yeah.
Do you see how that hurt Damien, i think it did.
Did you see how they talked about his witnesses ?
They didn't have anything to talk about us, they didn't have anything to talk about,
'cause we didn't give 'em a chance.
And...
Oh, man.
It's heavy.
Do you think that this will change at all...
How you choose your friends ?
Yeah.
What do you think this will do to you and your friendship with Damien ?
Stop it, I guess.
Would you stop being his friend ?
I wouldn't be his enemy, but, I probably wouldn't be around.
You heard what was said about him.
Do you think he could've done it ?
About what they said ?
Do you think
Damien could've killed those little boys ?
They made it seem like he did.
What do you think ?
I don't know.
If you were on that jury would you have a hard time letting him go ?
Based on what you heard ?
Yeah.
I would too.
Would you let yourself go ?
Yeah.
If I was...
Up there
I'd let myself go.
That's the answer i wanna hear.
'Cause you know you didn't do it, don't you ?
Yeah.
Did Paul surprise you on his closing ?
I think Paul should've left out the guilt by association part.
He came out hard on that, didn't he ?
Did you have any idea he was gonna do that ?
Mm-mmm.
I thought he'd be smart enough to stay away from that.
Hurt your feelings ?
I wanted to strangle him.
Were you watching the jury ?
Mm-hmm.
How do you pick it ?
With my finger.
Now, I think it was probably about 60-40.
40 for us, and 60 against us.
Once you get outta here, you gonna buy the beer ?
The whiskey.
I don't want beer.
And I'll buy the bojangles' chicken.
I wanna get a cigar, cut it open and dump all the tobacco out, fill it up with marijuana, smoke the whole thing.
We gotta get you out of here, you gotta go to work and pay my bill.
I'll get a job at a gas station or something, change my name to "Bob Smith".
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the bailiff's informed me that you've arrived at verdicts, if you have, pass them to the bailiff or the sheriff.
The first verdict reads at as follows,
"we the jury find Damien echols guilty of capital murder
"in the death of Stevie branch,
"we the jury find Damien echols guilty of capital murder
"in the death of
Chris byers,
"we the jury find Damien echols guilty of capital murder
"in the death of Michael Moore.
"We the jury find Jason Baldwin guilty of capital murder
"in the the death of Chris byers,
"we the jury find Jason Baldwin guilty of capital murder
"in the death of Stevie branch,
"we the jury find Jason Baldwin guilty of capital murder in the death of Michael Moore", all of the verdicts were signed by the foreman, ladies and gentlemen, it's necessary at this time that the court poll the jury, as to all six verdicts, so when your name is called, if these six verdicts represent your individual verdict, then answer "yes" as your name is called.
Juror number one.
Yes.
Juror number two.
Yes.
Juror number three.
Yes.
Juror number seven.
Yes.
The prosecution didn't have any evidence, but they don't care.
Just because somebody wears black and has different beliefs, they're gonna convict them of something.
Poor, poor parents, yeah, I'm sorry for 'em--
I ain't, i ain't sorry for 'em.
I don't give a damn about the parents, but I'm sorry for the kids.
I ain't, ain't sorry for an.
There's no reason to kill three more boys.
That didn't do a damn thing.
Right now I wish i was a witch, talk about a spell on somebody.
Boy, I'd put a good one on.
I guess gitchell goes out with a big "bang", you know he's fuckin' gonna retire.
Now he's probably gonna run for office.
I got an office for him.
Mayor of hell.
As far as I'm concerned west Memphis can go to hell.
West Memphis is hell.
I have put my 20 years in, and hopefully this is the last case
I'll have of this magnitude, hopefully, it's my last case.
And...
I'm leaving on a high note.
So there's no better way to leave than your head up, high and proud.
Well you know, i don't--
I'm not surprised, if that's what you're asking.
I told you earlier,
I thought the evidence was more than sufficient to make those findings.
They won't kill no more babies.
No more babies will they kill.
Let's go.
You're gonna get out !
You're gonna fry, Damien !
You're gonna fry, Damien !
We know you're innocent, Jason !
I knew from when i was real small, that people were gonna know who I was,
I always had that feelin', but, I just never knew how they were gonna learn.
I kinda enjoy it,
'cause now even after I die, people are gonna remember me forever, they're gonna talk about me for years, people in west Memphis will tell their kids stories, it'll be sort of like
I'm the west Memphis boogey man.
Little kids will be lookin' under their bed,
"Damien might be under there."

EVERY MOMENT
THAT THEY'RE ON THE BUS,
FOR EVERY DAY THEY'VE LIVED
THUS FAR TO SEEM AS...
A ABSTRACT WRECKAGE...
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
BUT IS PROBABLY A DELUSION,
AND THAT THIS IS
THE FIRST REAL DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
NOT TO GENERALIZE.
AGAIN, WITH EVERY BUSLOAD,
THERE'S INTERNATIONALITY...
AND THEREFORE DIFFERENT
GRADATIONS...
OF CRUISING MANIFESTATION.
BUT I, UH--
I FIND MYSELF
CONNECTING...
WITH SOME OF THEM
MORE THAN OTHERS.
- IT IS RAINING?
- KIND OF.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
WHAT'S UP, BENITEZ?
- WE'RE LEAVING.
- WE'RE LEAVING?
- OH, IT'S RAINING.
- NO!
IT'S NOT RAINING.
GREENWICH VILLAGE,
ONE OF THOSE RARE DISTRICTS...
THAT OCCURS ONCE IN A WHILE
IN HUMAN HISTORY.
FEAR, A BASIC THEME
OF ALL OF OUR LIVES.
CONSTANTLY AFRAID ALONG THE
STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE,
UNDER THREAT
OF ASSASSINATION,
AND THE ASSASSINS
ARE OUR DREAMS TRIUMPHANT,
THE BY-PRODUCT OF SUCH A PURSUIT--
CREATIVITY AND RADICALIZATION--
WHICH ARE THE FURTHER THEMES
OF GREENWICH VILLAGE LINEAGE.
RIGHT NOW YOU ARE
SIX AND A HALF BLOCKS...
FROM WHERE THOMAS PAINE DIES.
PAINE, THE INFIDEL
REVOLUTIONARY,
AUTHOR OF THE COMMON SENSE
AND THE CRISIS,
TWO OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL
POLITICAL PAMPHLETS...
OF AMERICAN HISTORY,
BOTH WRITTEN DURING
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
THOMAS PAINE RETURNS
TO GROVE STREET...
TO DIE IN A SOMEWHAT DISGRACE...
SOON AFTER BEING IMPRISONED
BY ROBESPIERRE IN PARIS...
DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.
YOU ARE THREE AND A HALF BLOCKS
FROM WHERE MARK TWAIN MOVES--
RIGHT AFTER HIS WIFE PASSES
AWAY-- ONTO WEST TENTH STREET.
TWAIN MOVING AT THAT TIME
A FEW DOORS DOWN...
FROM O. HENRY.
FOUR AND A HALF BLOCKS
FROM WHERE EDGAR ALLAN POE...
HAS A SHORT-TERM RESIDENCE...
DEEP IN THE HEART
OF HIS OPIUM ADDICTION.
ALTHOUGH HE HAS MANY RESIDENCES
THROUGHOUT THAT DELUSIONAL TIME,
HE WRITES "THE RAVEN"
AT 61 CARMINE STREET.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE...
THE AMERICAN NOVELIST
HENRY JAMES IS BORN...
AND FROM WHERE EDITH WHARTON...
SPENDS MUCH OF HER
ARISTOCRATIC CHILDHOOD...
ON WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK
ITSELF.
AND THIS...
IS SEVENTH AVENUE SOUTH
IN FRONT OF YOU,
THE MODERN SEMI-EXPRESSWAY
OF GREENWICH VILLAGE.
SIX BLOCKS FROM THE PROVINCETOWN
PLAYHOUSE WHERE EUGENE O'NEILL...
BEGINS HIS EARLY
PLAYWRITING CAREER.
SIX BLOCKS FROM WHERE
HENRY MILLER DECIDES...
HE HATES NEW YORK CITY FOREVER...
AND MOVES TO PARIS.
TWO BLOCKS FROM
WHERE WILLA CATHER LIVES.
THREE BLOCKS FROM
WHERE E.E CUMMINGS LIVES.
THREE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
SHERWOOD ANDERSON LIVES.
FOUR BLOCKS FROM
WHERE H.L. MENCKEN LIVES,
FOUR BLOCKS FROM WHERE
THEODORE DREISER LIVES.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
NATHANAEL WEST LIVES.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM
WHERE D.H. LAWRENCE...
LIVES LASCIVIOUSLY.
FOUR BLOCKS FROM
WHERE JACK REED LIVES,
AUTHOR OF TEN DAYS
THAT SHOOK THE WORLD,
THE FIRST AND ONLY AMERICAN TO
BE BURIED IN THE KREMLIN WALL.
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS
TO THE RADICAL JACK REED,
HE LIVES YOUTHFULLY
AT 42 WASHINGTON SQUARE.
HIS NEIGHBOR ACROSS
THE HALL, MAX EASTMAN,
EDITOR OF THE MASSES NEWSPAPER,
PUBLISHED TWO BLOCKS AWAY
IN A BASEMENT,
THE MAJOR COMMUNIST PUBLICATION
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
TWO BLOCKS FROM WHERE
ARTHUR MILLER, THE PLAYWRIGHT,
CONTEMPLATES SUICIDE...
AND FROM WHERE JIM MORRISON
DOES THE SAME.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
THE POET DYLAN THOMAS DIES.
HIS FAMOUS LAST WORDS:
"I JUST HAD MY 16th MARTINI".
HE LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS...
IN THE WHITE HORSE
TAVERN ON HUDSON STREET...
AND NEVER REGAINS IT.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
DOROTHY PARKER WRESTLES...
WITH ALCOHOLISM AND
THE DEFEATS OF A LIFETIME...
AND FAILS.
NEW YORK CITY
IS A LIVING ORGANISM.
IT EVOLVES, IT DEVOLVES.
IT FLUCTUATES AS A LIVING ORGANISM.
SO MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH NEW YORK CITY...
IS AS VITRIOLIC AS
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MYSELF...
AND WITH ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING,
WHICH MEANS THAT IT CHANGES
EVERY MILLISECOND,
THAT IT'S IN
CONSTANT FLUCTUATION.
THIS WINTER I REALLY FELT
LIKE WE WERE GETTING A DIVORCE.
AND I WAS CERTAINLY
THE LOSER OF THAT DIVORCE.
THERE WAS ANGER.
I WAS OVERWHELMED.
I WAS REEMERGED
INTO MY OWN NAIVETE.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW ANGRY
THE CITY WAS WITH ME.
IT SEEMED LIKE A VINDICTIVE WOMAN,
TO BE LIKE NO REASON WHATSOEVER,
JUST BY THE PURE RAGE
OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE.
BECAUSE THE CONCRETE SETTLED.
BECAUSE THE TERRA-COTTA
HAD BEEN METICULOUSLY CARVED.
BECAUSE SOME OF THE BUILDINGS
ARE HIGHER THAN OTHERS.
THE ANGER, THE INFERIORITY,
THAT SOME OF
THE SHORTER BUILDINGS FEEL, I FELT.
I SUDDENLY WAS NOT WELCOME
ON THIS ISLAND ANYMORE.
AND THE CITY AND I HAVE HAD...
A REEMERGENCE OF SOME KIND
IN THE SUMMER,
MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE
TO REFUEL MY CRUISE A LITTLE BIT...
BY WORKING LABORIOUSLY...
AND CRAWLING
MY WAY BACK ONTO THE ISLAND.
BECAUSE PERHAPS I PAID
PROPER RESPECT TO IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE CITY WAS SO
ANGRY WITH ME DURING THIS WINTER.
I'M JUST GLAD THAT IT'S NOT QUITE
AS ANGRY WITH ME RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK
TOO SOON, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
LIKE I SAID, THE RELATIONSHIP
SEEMS TO CHANGE,
AS ANY HUMAN
RELATIONSHIP WOULD...
AND WITH ANY LIVING THING.
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF THIS
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,
IT'S MORE ON THE LINES OF A CYCLOPS.
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF IT
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,
PERHAPS IT'S MORE ON THE
LEVEL OF A SCINTILLATING,
STREAMLINED MERMAID...
WHO SINGS TO ME AT NIGHT.
I GUESS I AM RIGHT NOW.
JOEL.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CHECK IN.
I DID THE 8:45 PICKUP.
HELLO. GRAY LINE.
YOU CAN STAY OUT THERE
ONE MINUTE.
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.
LET ME SEE IF MISS GALL
IS HERE. HOLD ON.
THE LOWER LOOP IN THE
DOWNTOWN DIRECTION...
NOW BOARDING THE BUS
OUTSIDE TO THE RIGHT.
WE NEED A TOUR GUIDE
FOR A SECOND SECTION DOWNTOWN.
HANG ON.
WAIT FOR THE SECOND SECTION.
I THINK OF EVERY
DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP...
AS ANOTHER LOOP
TOWARDS MY DEATH.
THAT IS WHY I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF THE DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP--
EACH LOOP AS A CONTINUOUS
AND INDIVIDUALIZED, UM,
SEARCH FOR PERFECTION.
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE...
THAT TO TELL THE HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...
IS TO TELL THE STORY
OF THE WORLD.
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS.
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
PEOPLE WORK...
INSIDE THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER BUILDINGS...
DAILY.
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
BUILDINGS HAVE THEIR OWN ZIP CODE.
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
TOWERS THEMSELVES,
BUILT TO SWAY IN HEAVY WINDS
A FOOT AND A HALF IN ANY DIRECTION.
SOMETHING
TO CONSIDER.
SO WHAT'S UP, TIM?
HOW'S THE GRAY LINE?
- GRAY LINE IS LIKE--
- APPLE'S BETTER, RIGHT?
YEAH, DAMN RIGHT.
APPLE WAS LIKE A LIVING CARNIVAL.
WE WERE COSSACKS,
AND WE TOOK WHAT WE WANTED.
WE THREW PEOPLE OVERBOARD,
OFF THE BUS, IF WE DIDN'T LIKE THEM.
IT WAS OUR TERRITORY.
THE CITY BELONGED TO US
AT APPLE. -APPLE IS BETTER.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- NUMBER ONE.
I HAD MORE OF AN ERECTION
WHEN I WORKED AT APPLE.
I JUST FELT LIKE
SO MUCH MORE OF A MAN.
YOU KNOW APPLE
IS BETTER, RIGHT? -YEAH!
I WANTED TO HEAR YOU
SAY YES.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY YES.
FOR GOD'S SAKES.
- NUMBER ONE.
- I'M GONNA PROBABLY GET FIRED.
I'LL PROBABLY BE HUNG
FROM A FLAGPOLE SOMEWHERE,
BUT APPLE IS BETTER.
APPLE IS BETTER!
I THINK THAT THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF APPLE TOURS,
IN THAT SENSE,
WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARTACUS.
SPARTACUS WAS ONE OF THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.
HE WOULD HAVE FIT IN
AT APPLE TOURS.
BRUTUS AND HIS CONSPIRATORS...
RIGHT BEFORE THE
ASSASSINATION OF CAESAR,
THEY WERE APPLE TOUR GUIDES.
BUT LIKE WILLY WONKA
IS A GRAY LINE TOUR GUIDE.
ALSO ONE OF MY GREAT
INSPIRATIONS ON THE TOUR ROUTE,
BUT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE.
ATTILA THE HUN...
WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD
APPLE DISPATCHER.
WHEREAS VIRGIL
IN THE INFERNO,
I THINK WOULD HAVE WORKED
FOR GRAY LINE.
HOW MANY YEAR NOW? -LIKE FOUR
YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THE TOUR.
NO, FIVE. DON'T SAY FOUR,
PLEASE. -FIVE YEARS.
YEAH! BY THE TIME
YOU WORKED AT GRAY LINE,
YOU GOT THAT TROLLEY BUS
AND YOU GO TO CENTRAL PARK.
- I REMEMBER THE DAMN TROLLEY.
- I WORKED ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER.
I REMEMBER THAT. -LATER ON
YOU COME WORK AT APPLE.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S BEEN
FIVE YEARS OF THIS, GOING IN CIRCLES.
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
ON THIS SIDEWALK FOR FIVE YEARS.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
OH, LOOK, STRAIGHT UP.
THAT'S A GREAT VIEW.
THE WHITE TERRA-COTTA
STRAIGHT AHEAD.
THAT'S THE ONE BUILDING THAT LOUIS
SULLIVAN DESIGNED...
FOR NEW YORK CITY.
HMM.
LOOK AT THE METICULOUSNESS.
THAT STRONG VERTICAL LAUNCH
IN THE FACADE...
IS TYPICAL
OF THE SULLIVAN MILIEU.
YOU KNOW, TERRA-COTTA...
BECOMES ONE OF THE
MAJOR MATERIALS...
OF NEW YORK CITY ARCHITECTURE.
IT'S LIKE
A SAND-BAKED BRICK.
IT'S NOT QUITE GRANITE,
AND IT'S NOT QUITE BRICK.
IT WALKS
THE MAINSTREAM MIDDLE.
IT WAS EXCELLENT
FOR NEW YORK ARCHITECTURE...
BECAUSE IT COULD HANG OFF
THE SKELETONS OF THE BUILDINGS.
IT'S MUCH LIGHTER THAN STONE.
THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH,
BETWEEN STONE AND TERRA-COTTA...
THAT STRIKES ME THE MOST...
IS THAT TERRA-COTTA REFLECTS THE
SUNLIGHT, AND STONE ABSORBS IT.
YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNCY LIGHT
ALONG THIS BUILDING.
WHEN I SEE TERRA-COTTA LIKE
THIS, IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL...
LIKE I'M SENSELESSLY RUNNING...
THROUGH A MEADOW OR
HIGH GRASSLAND AREA NUDE,
CHASING A WOMAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE WHO'S ENTIRELY NUDE.
IT'S JUST THE MOST RAW
AND PRIMORDIAL CHASE.
TWO NUDE HUMAN BEINGS RUNNING
THROUGH GRASSLAND MARSH AREA.
AS YOU MOVE UP THE BUILDING,
CAN'T YOU FEEL THE
UNDULATIONS OF HER CURVATURE?
THE--
OHH! YES!
YES!
TH-THAT SLIGHT GROAN...
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE
IN THE ACT OF INTERCOURSE.
THE, LIKE, "UHH!"
LIKE THE SOMEWHAT DYING GRUNT
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN GRUNTING...
IN THE STORMS
OF HER OWN MALAISE.
YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE
METICULATIONS OF THE CORNICE LINES
OF THE TERRA-COTTA.
THAT'S WHY THE TERRA-COTTA
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.
IT'S THE "UHH,"
THE "UHH" MOMENTS OF LIFE.
UHH! UHH!
YES! YES!
OH, GOD, PLEASE!
THE BEGGING PARTS OF LIFE
ON THE LEFT SIDE.
YOU SEE THOSE LION-ESQUE
CHARACTERS WAY UP THERE?
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME
IN THE BACK?
TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND TREES
ARE PLANTED,
TEN AND A HALF MILLION CARTLOADS
OF TOPSOIL IMPORTED...
AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES
OF DRAINAGE PIPES LAID,
AND THESE ARE
THE BASIC INGREDIENTS...
OF THE SUPPOSEDLY NATURAL
CREATION...
CALLED CENTRAL PARK.
THERE IS NOTHING NATURAL
ABOUT CENTRAL PARK.
WELCOME.
FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED,
THE ESSENTIAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT
OF THIS ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK,
SEES A GROUP OF BOYS PLAYING A
PRIMORDIAL FORM OF BASEBALL...
ON THE LOWER PLAY LAWNS
IN THE 1850s,
AND AT THAT MOMENT OUTLAWS
BASEBALL FROM CENTRAL PARK.
THE MEN WHO BUILD AND DESIGN THIS
PARK ARE TRANSCENDENTALISTS.
TO THEM, CENTRAL PARK IS A
PLACE TO BECOME ONE WITH NATURE,
TO FOCUS ON TREES,
TO SCINTILLATE WITH GRASS,
TO STARE INTO
ONE ANOTHER'S EYES.
NO SWEATING ALLOWED
IN THE ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK.
NO PERSPIRATION
OF ANY KIND.
ANYONE YOU SEE CONGREGATING
FOR THE BASEBALL GAME ON THE LEFT,
BICYCLING,
ROLLER-BLADING, JOGGING,
THEY ARE NOT
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.
ANYONE YOU SEE LOUNGING
IN THE SUN,
HAVING A PICNIC
OR KISSING,
THEY ARE
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.
ACK! "MUCHO" GRACIAS.
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- SAY HOLA TO BUENOS AIRES FOR ME.
¿COMO?
SAY HELLO TO BUENOS AIRES
FOR ME.
- SAY HELLO?
- MM-HMM.
HELLO, YEAH. WHEN YOU
GET TO BUENOS AIRES.
- AH, YES.
- YES. SI.
THANK YOU.
- CIAO.
- BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL. WE'RE BEAUTIFUL.
THE PARK IS BEAUTIFUL.
- YES. THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK.
- NICE TO MEET YOU. CIAO.
- CIAO.
- ADIOS.
STYLE.
I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT BIDS.
WERE YOU INTERESTED IN TAKING ONE?
OH, UM, I LOOKED AT
WHAT'S LEFT.
THE ONES I WAS INTERESTED IN WERE
TAKEN. -JUST WANTED TO CHECK.
THE ONLY ONE I WOULD'VE BEEN
INTERESTED IN THAT WASN'T TAKEN...
WAS THAT 34.
BUT THAT'S GOT SUCH AN EARLY
HOTEL PICKUP, AND I-- YOU KNOW.
SO YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
- PICK A BID...
SO YOU'LL KNOW YOU'LL HAVE STEADY
WORK. -TAKE THE DAMN BID, LEVITCH!
YEAH, BUT I WAS TALKING TO TANYA.
THERE'S NO WAY TO REWRITE THE BIDS?
NO REWRITING. -LIKE--
THEY'RE, LIKE, WITH SOLIDITY.
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- TAKE THE BID, TIM.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T CARE WHEN
YOU'RE UP AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ANYWAY AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING.
NEITHER DO I.
I'M DOIN' IT. YOU GET 20 HOURS
A WEEK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YEAH, YOU GET 20 HOURS A
WEEK, AND THAT'S ONE THING.
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT.
IT'S BEIN' DECIDED NOW.
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT
ANYWAY, TIM. -DON'T BE LATE.
RIGHT. -IT MAY BE
TOO LATE IN A FEW MINUTES.
- REALLY?
- REALLY.
THIS IS LIKE MY LAST FEW
MINUTES TO REALLY DECIDE.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I'LL TAKE THESE NEXT FEW MINUTES...
AND DEEPLY
CONTEMPLATE AND MAKE SURE.
IF I HAVE AN ESSENTIAL GOAL
ON THE CRUISE RIGHT NOW,
I THINK THAT
THE SIMPLEST GOAL...
IS PERHAPS TO--
TO BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT...
THAT I AM THRILLED
TO BE ALIVE...
AND TO BE STILL RESPECTED.
THE MORE SOULFUL OF US--
I SUPPOSE THE BUDDHIST OR
WHATEVER LABEL YOU WANT TO PUT...
ON THOSE EXPERIENCING
FURTHER INDIVIDUALITY...
MIGHT SAY, "LOOK, WHY SHOULD YOU
CARE ABOUT RESPECT FROM OTHERS?
"JUST THE THRILL OF BEING ALIVE
IS YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
YOU CAN DO THAT ALONE
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM".
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE CRUISE IS FOR ME.
THE CRUISE IS ABOUT
THE SEARCHINGS...
FOR EVERYTHING WORTHWHILE
IN EXISTENCE.
IT IS ABOUT WALKING INTO THE BAR
AND LUSTING AFTER...
ALL THE WORTHWHILE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE WORLD.
IT IS ABOUT FLESH.
IT IS ABOUT WAVES
UNDULATING.
AND IT IS ABOUT
EXHIBITIONISM.
YOU KNOW, I WANT
TO LOOK AT THE FLOWER...
AND APPRECIATE THE
BEAUTY OF A FLOWER.
SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT SAY,
"YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER
AND BECOME THE FLOWER.
ISN'T THAT EVEN BETTER?"
BUT THEN I FURTHER
WOULD LOVE IT ON THE CRUISE...
IF I CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER,
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY
OF THE FLOWER...
AND THEN HAVE THE FLOWER
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF ME.
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT CRUISING RIGHT NOW.
YES, BECOMING THE FLOWER WOULD
BE A LOT OF FUN. I CAN DO THAT TOO.
I CAN DO THAT ON WEDNESDAY.
I'M FREE THURSDAY AFTERNOON.
I CAN TRY TO BECOME THE FLOWER.
BUT COME THE WEEKEND,
GODDAMN IT,
I WILL APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF THE FLOWER,
AND THEN LIKEWISE,
I WILL STAND EXHIBITIONISTIC,
HAVING THE FLOWER APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF ME.
I THINK HAVING AN INTIMATE
"LOVE AFFAIR"...
WITH A FLOWER...
IS FAR MORE PSYCHOTIC
AND RIVETING...
THAN HAVING
"A LOVE AFFAIR"...
WITH SOME OF THE BANAL CREATURES
OF THE HUMAN RACE.
ALTHOUGH I'D BE
INTO THAT TOO.
WELCOME.
THIS IS MY FRIEND RUSSIO'S ROOM,
AND I'M CRASHING HERE RIGHT NOW.
CIVILIZATION...
IS THE AMPUTATION...
OF EVERYTHING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US,
AN EXPERIMENT CREATED...
BY ALIENS...
UNABLE TO HAVE SEX.
CIVILIZATION
IS THE MOLESTATION...
OF EVERYTHING
WE EVER COULD BE,
A GIANT REPRESSION
MELTING INTO SUPPRESSION,
SO THAT YOU NEVER SAY
WHAT YOU MEAN.
CIVILIZATION...
IS BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS,
SPLITTING US APART.
WE ARE WRECKAGE...
WITH BEATING HEARTS.
CIVILIZATION
IS A CAN OF HAIR SPRAY...
SPRAYING FOR
THE SEASONLESS VEIN...
INTO A HAIR NET
MADE UP OF CURLS,
ONLY EVER MEANT TO BE WAVES.
CIVILIZATION--
GENOCIDE BELIEFS,
MORALISTIC,
SEE-THROUGH LACE BLOUSES,
MISSILES BALLISTIC,
LACKADAISICAL,
MELANCHOLIC RED LIPSTICK.
WHEN ONE FEELS NAUSEOUS
BUT DOESN'T FEEL SICK.
CIVILIZATION
KNEW WHO YOU WERE...
BEFORE YOU WERE EVER BORN,
FORGAVE YOU WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED FORGIVING.
AND YOU NEVER ONCE...
SURPRISED...
THIS CIVILIZATION.
AND YOU NEVER ONCE FELT...
THAT SENSATION.
ANY PASSENGERS GOING TO THE
CIRCLE LINE BOAT...
ARE TO CHECK IN
AT THE FRONT DESK.
LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
ANYBODY GOING TO
THE CIRCLE LINE BOAT
FOR NEW YORK WATERWAYS CRUISE,
PLEASE CHECK IN TO
THE FRONT DESK,
LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE
WAITING FOR THAT BUS.
OKAY, TIMMY,
READY TO ROLL?
READY TO ROLL. LET'S DO IT
RIGHT. LET'S FUCKING TOUR.
I WANNA GO HOME.
FOURTEEN HUNDRED
AND SEVENTY-SIX FEET...
OF ORGANIZED
GRANITE AND LIMESTONE.
SIXTY-FOUR HUNDRED
WINDOWS.
TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND
RENTABLE INTERIOR METERS OF SPACE.
SEVEN MILES
OF ELEVATOR SHAFTS.
A SLICE OF THE STATE
OF INDIANA...
VAULTED ONTO THE CORNER
OF 34th STREET AND FIFTH AVENUE.
KING KONG CLIMBED IT.
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
WILL BE IN FRONT OF US...
WHEN O'SHAYNE MAKES
THE MASCULINE TURN.
IF ARCHITECTURE IS THE HISTORY
OF ALL PHALLIC EMOTION,
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING...
IS UTTER CATHARSIS,
AND WE ARE SITTING
IN ITS SILHOUETTE.
THE BEAUTIFUL PYRAMID
ATOP THE CHRYSLER BUILDING,
MEANT TO BE A REPLICA
OF THE FRONT GRILLE...
ON A 1928 CHRYSLER CAR.
LEWIS MUMFORD, THE MAJOR
ARCHITECTURAL CRITIC OF THAT ERA,
CALLED
THE CHRYSLER BUILDING...
QUOTE,
"UNINSPIRED VOLUPTUOUSNESS".
END QUOTE.
UNINSPIRED VOLUPTUOUSNESS...
IN THE SUNLIGHT.
SUNLIGHT-- POWERFUL.
THE SUN, ANOTHER GREAT
NEW YORK CITY LANDMARK,
ABOVE YOU ON THE LEFT.
THE ARCH IN THE PARK WILL BE
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUS...
WHEN O'SHAYNE SWINGS US
ONTO 14th STREET.
AND 14th STREET IS THE WIDEST
STREET OF MANHATTAN ISLAND.
THIS IS WHERE THE ISLAND IS...
LITERALLY TWO AND
A HALF MILES WIDE.
AND THAT IS IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THAT IS ALL.
TWO AND HALF MILES IS AS WIDE
AS THIS CACOPHONY GETS.
THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILES LONG.
2.4 MILLION PEOPLE.
BE 1.7 MILLION PEOPLE,
I HEARD RECENTLY, BUT I DON'T CARE.
THE FULTON FISH MARKET...
WILL BE MORE OF AN ODOR THAN A
LANDMARK AT THIS TIME OF DAY,
BUT IT REALLY SWINGS OUT
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
ANOTHER TIMOTHY SPEED LEVITCH
RECOMMENDATION,
IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP
AND YOU LIKE FISH.
I HOPE YOU CAN FEEL
THE OMNISCIENCE OF THIS MOMENT,
AS WE HAVE BEEN
BLOCKING THIS TRAFFIC...
AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT.
SENSE THE GRANDEUR
OF YOUR POWER...
AS WE DISRUPT ONE LIFE
AFTER ANOTHER.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NAME IS
TIMOTHY. FONTANEZ IS DOWNSTAIRS.
IF YOU NEED ADVICE
OR DIRECTIONS ON NEW YORK CITY,
ON STYLE, ON HOW TO APPEAR
AS A DEBONAIR INDIVIDUAL...
DESPITE INTERIOR FEELINGS
OF DESPAIR,
LET US KNOW.
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT
TOURISM IS A SERVICE TRADE,
AND TIPS ARE ALWAYS APPRECIATED.
WE MEAN THAT.
WE WILL REMEMBER YOU.
THIS IS OUR
CENTRAL PARK SOUTH STOP.
OH, IT'S BIG MONEY,
FONTANEZ.
YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT LATER,
TAKE YOUR CHILDREN
OUT... -AND GET DRUNK.
...FOR SOME ICE CREAM
CONES. -AND GET DRUNK.
YEAH, THAT TOO. WOW.
ONE OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES
OF THIS EXPERIMENT
CALLED CIVILIZATION...
IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING.
IT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING,
IF I HAD A CHOICE--
OTHER THAN MY ACNE--
I THINK WOULD BE THE FIRST THING
I WOULD REMOVE FROM MY LIFE.
IF I COULD ERASE AN
ASPECT OF MY LIFE,
IT WOULD BE THIS NEED
TO WORK FOR A LIVING.
YOU UNDERSTAND, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE TOUR ITSELF.
WHEN I'M ON THE TOUR ITSELF...
AND I'M SHOWING OTHERS
THE APPRECIATION OF BEAUTY...
AND THE HUGENESS OF ALL THIS,
AND EXPERIENCING THE LASCIVIOUS
VOYEURISM OF THE TOUR BUS,
AND EROTICIZING WOMEN
IN A CONSPIRACY WITH THIS CITY,
AND HAVING SPIRITUAL
TANTRIC CONNECTIONS...
WITH INTERNATIONAL
FLESH CONGREGATIONS,
THIS IS NOT, IN MY MIND,
WORKING FOR A LIVING.
YET, AT THE SAME TIME,
IT IS,
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE WEEK
WHEN I'VE MADE $200 AFTER TAXES...
AND I HAVE ALL THESE OTHER
PRAGMATIC EXPENSES...
JUST TO KEEP THE CRUISE ALIVE,
YOU KNOW, IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER WAKE UP
EARLY IN THE MORNING AGAIN,
NOT UNLESS I WAS CRUISING.
THE ROADS AROUND YOU NOW...
WILL BECOME CLAUSTROPHOBIC
AND NARROW IN FEELING.
AND THIS WILL NOT JUST BE
YOUR OWN PROJECTION.
THE ROADS ARE CLAUSTROPHOBIC
AND NARROW IN FEELING.
THESE ARE THE OLDEST ROADWAYS
OF MANHATTAN ISLAND.
THESE DESIGNED BY THE DUTCH
IN THE EARLY 17th CENTURY.
WELCOME TO NEW AMSTERDAM.
FONTANEZ CONTINUES TO
AUDACIOUSLY IMPROVISE,
NOT ONLY WITH THE TOUR ROUTE,
BUT WITH HIS OWN LIFE.
NEXT DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP
IS IN 20 MINUTES.
NO MORE BOARDING AT THIS TIME.
NEXT DOUBLE-DECKER
LOOP TOUR IS IN 20 MINUTES.
NO BOARDING AT THIS TIME.
YOU'VE GOT BLOOD ALL OVER YOU.
FUCKIN' SHAVING THIS MORNING
WAS LIKE A CARNAGE.
JUST CLEAN YOURSELF UP. -THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO.
GEORGE WAS CRITICIZING
THE LINING.
I'LL GRANT YOU, IT'S NOT IN
GOOD SHAPE. IT NEEDS NEW LINING.
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
THAT SHOULD AFFECT MY, YOU KNOW--
THE COSMETICS ARE A TRICKY THING
ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS.
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF SIMPLE...
...CONFORMIST FASTIDIOUSNESS,
YOU KNOW.
I'M NOT DRESSING TO IMPRESS
MY GRANDMOTHER, YOU KNOW.
I AM, IN A LAUNCHING
AND VITRIOLIC WAY,
TRYING, AT ANY EXPENSE,
TO GRAB THE COLLARS OF PEOPLE...
WHO HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY...
AND TRYING TO GRAB
THEIR ATTENTION...
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE GREATEST TUMULTUOUSNESS.
AND RIPPED LINING
IS PART OF THAT ROUTINE.
I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT, THOUGH,
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER DONE IT.
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THEIR DOUBLE-DECKER TOUR.
ST. PAUL'S CHURCH, IN BROWN,
IN FRONT OF THE BUS,
SITTING ON BROADWAY ITSELF,
WAS BUILT BY THE BRITISH EMPIRE...
WHEN THIS WAS STILL
A COLONY IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE...
AND NOT A STATE
IN THE UNION.
GEORGE WASHINGTON--
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.
HE TOOK HIS OATH OF OFFICE...
AS THE FIRST PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES...
AT THE CORNER
OF WALL STREET AND BROAD,
APRIL 30, 1789.
JUST AFTER THE OATH, WASHINGTON
IS MARCHED IN A PROCESSION HERE...
ON THE LEFT, UP BROADWAY,
TAKING A FURTHER LEFT TURN
INTO ST. PAUL'S CHURCH.
WASHINGTON KNEELS AT THE ALTAR
ON A PILLOW...
AND PRAYS FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE UNION.
THE PILLOW STILL SITS
UNDER GLASS...
AT THE ALTAR IN ST. PAUL'S,
ON YOUR LEFT.
"I LOVE THE MAN
THAT CAN SMILE IN TROUBLE,
"THAT CAN GATHER STRENGTH
IN TOTAL DISTRESS...
AND GROW BY REFLECTION".
THOMAS PAINE PARK.
YOU KNOW, ACCORDING
TO THE CITY REPORTS,
ELEVEN PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED
OFF THIS BRIDGE...
AND SURVIVED.
ONE OF MY CRUISING
DREAMS WOULD BE...
TO GET A CRUISE TOGETHER
WITH THOSE 11.
I LOVE THESE THINGS.
I CRUISED THIS BRIDGE
ONCE SOLO...
WHEN I WAS IN
A SEVERE SOLO ANGST,
WHEN THE ENTIRE WORLD HAD
DIVORCED ITSELF FROM ME...
ON A SINGULAR EVENING,
WHICH IS USUALLY
ON TUESDAY NIGHTS.
AND, UH,
I CRUISED THE BRIDGE,
REALIZING THAT, UH,
THE PILLARS OF STONE...
WERE MY FRIENDS.
THEY REALLY
MAKE ME FEEL WHOLE.
THEY REMIND ME THAT MY FUTURE
HAS A BRIGHTNESS, PERHAPS.
EVEN IF I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO BELIEVES THAT,
I KNOW THEY BELIEVE IT.
ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT...
HAVING THE TRIPTYCHS OF
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AS A FRIEND,
CERTAINLY, IS THAT
IT NEVER CONTRADICTS ME.
IF IT MAKES ME FEEL FUTILE,
IT DOES IT INDIRECTLY,
WITH A SUBTLETY.
IT DOES IT WITH AN AMBIVALENCE
AND AN ALOOFNESS.
THERE'S NO VICTORY
IN ITS SUBJUGATION OF ME.
IF IT SUBJUGATES ME,
THAT'S THE DELUSION,
THE POWER OF MY OWN MIND.
THE BEST MOMENTS IN
OUR FRIENDSHIPS...
ARE WHEN I BECOME THE
BROOKLYN BRIDGE IN MY MIND,
WHEN I REALIZE
THAT WE ARE EQUALS.
THESE ARE
THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS.
YEAH, SEE THESE TWO TOWERS?
THE TWIN TOWERS, SEE?
BROTHERS.
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO, UM,
SPIN IN BETWEEN
THE TWO TOWERS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UM, SPIN AROUND
AND YOU MAKE YOURSELF DIZZY?
THEN YOU LOOK UP,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BUILDINGS
ARE FALLING IN ON TOP OF YOU.
YEAH, I RECOMMEND THAT.
IT'S FUN.
IF YOU GET TO STAND IN THE
PLAZA BETWEEN THE TWO TOWERS.
BUT DON'T LOOK UP
UNTIL AFTER YOU'RE DIZZY.
GOOD VIEW
OF COMMUTERS...
RUNNING TOWARDS
THEIR DESTINATIONS...
AND FROM THEMSELVES.
I THINK THAT WHEN I
THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE,
INTERESTINGLY, I THINK
ABOUT MY GRANDPARENTS,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
MY GRANDPARENTS
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
I SPENT MANY
FORMATIVE MOMENTS...
IN MY FORMATIVE YEARS
WITH THEM.
ALL OF MY SUMMERS
WERE CRUISING WITH THEM.
AND FROM THEIR
POINT OF VIEW,
I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL
THAT I AM CURRENTLY A FAILURE...
AND WILL ALWAYS BE
A DOWNTRODDEN FAILURE.
AND I THINK THAT OFTEN THAT
MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FUTURE...
VEER TOWARDS THEIR POINTS
OF VIEW ON THE UNIVERSE,
WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT,
AND WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT...
IS A BASIC SELF-PRESERVATIONISM...
AND SECURITY THAT I AM NOT
CREATING FOR MYSELF.
WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE
IMPORTANT IS HAVING AN OCCUPATION,
A NICHE IN SOCIETY,
SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE AT A PARTY AND
SOMEBODY ASKS YOU WHAT YOU DO,
YOU'LL HAVE
A SINGLE-WORD ANSWER...
OR AT LEAST YOU CAN ANSWER
WITHIN A SENTENCE.
WELCOME. I KNOW THAT THEY
THINK THAT I'M NOT ALTOGETHER...
WITH MY FEET ON THE GROUND.
I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL THEY'RE
GOING TO BE DYING VERY SOON...
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I AM
GOING TO KIND OF FADE OUT...
INTO A SUPRATERRESTRIAL
FAILURE.
A SERIES OF AGGRAVATIONS,
A SERIES OF FRUSTRATIONS.
THEIR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ME
FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE...
IS SOMETHING I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN CONTENDING WITH...
AND ALWAYS BEEN OBSESSED WITH.
BYE-BYE. THANK YOU.
IF I HAD AN IMMEDIATE GOAL
ON AN AFTERNOON LIKE TODAY,
IT WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE
SOME CONCRETENESS TO THEM,
TO GIVE THEM
A PLATTER OF SUCCESS,
EVEN IF IT WAS ONE ANECDOTE.
SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD,
IN THEIR OWN WORLD...
AND THEIR OWN VERNACULAR,
TASTE AND SAY,
"YES, HE DOES HAVE SOMETHING.
THERE IS HOPE.
THERE IS SOME SORT
OF SUCCESS IN HIS LIFE".
I GRANT YOU,
ALL THESE WORDS I'M USING
ARE KIND OF BLAND AND VAGUE TERMS,
BUT IN MY GRANDPARENTS' WORLD,
THEY'RE THE MOST CONCRETE AND
ABSORBING GOALS A PERSON CAN HAVE.
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE
ABLE TO TELL MY GRANDPARENTS...
THAT I'VE DONE SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN APPRECIATE,
THAT THEY CAN RESPECT.
I REALLY, REALLY
DO NOT WANT TO BECOME...
THE PERSON THAT THEY THINK
THAT I'M GOING TO BECOME.
THE, UH, IMAGE MAKES ME THINK
OF THIS CONVERSATION,
UH, WITH THIS WOMAN
THE OTHER DAY.
SHE WAS A FASTIDIOUS, JUDAIC-TYPE
WOMAN IN VERY SEXUAL SLACKS.
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE GRID PLAN.
AND I MADE THE COMMENT
ABOUT HOW, YOU KNOW,
THE GRID PLAN EMANATES
FROM OUR WEAKNESSES,
THIS LAYOUT OF AVENUES
AND STREETS IN NEW YORK CITY,
THIS SYSTEM
OF 90-DEGREE ANGLES.
TO ME, THE GRID PLAN IS PURITAN,
IT'S HOMOGENIZING,
IN A CITY WHERE THERE IS
NO HOMOGENIZATION AVAILABLE.
THERE IS ONLY TOTAL EXISTENCE,
TOTAL CACOPHONY,
A TOTAL FLOWING OF HUMAN
ETHNICITIES AND TRIBES AND BEINGS...
AND GRADATIONS OF AWARENESS
AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND CRUISING.
AND--
THIS WOMAN TURNS TO ME. SHE GOES,
"I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT".
SHE GOES, "I CAN'T IMAGINE IT.
EVERYONE LIKES THE GRID PLAN".
OF COURSE,
THE QUESTION IS,
"WHO IS EVERYONE?"
IT'S JUST WHAT I HAD SAID.
WHOEVER THAT IS
UNDER THE WHITE COMFORTER,
CUDDLED UP WITH 34th STREET
AND BROADWAY,
EXISTING ON THE CONCRETE
OF THIS CITY,
HUNGRY AND DISHEVELLED,
STRUGGLING TO CRAWL
THEIR WAY ONTO THIS ISLAND...
WITH ALL OF THEIR MACHINATED
RAGES AND HELLISHNESS...
AND SELF-ORCHESTRATED
PURGATORIES--
I MEAN, WHAT DOES THAT PERSON
THINK ABOUT THE GRID PLAN?
PROBABLY MUCH MORE ON MY PLANE
OF THINKING, MY GRADATION OF BEING,
WHICH IS, LET'S JUST
BLOW UP THE GRID PLAN...
AND REWRITE THE STREETS TO BE...
MUCH MORE A SELF-PORTRAITURE
OF OUR PERSONAL STRUGGLES,
RATHER THAN SOME REAL ESTATE
BROKER'S WET DREAM FROM 1807.
WE'RE FORCED TO WALK
IN THESE RIGHT ANGLES.
DOESN'T SHE FIND IT
INFURIATING?
BY BEING SO COMPLETELY
ALLEGIANT TO THE GRID PLAN--
I THINK MOST NOTEWORTHY
IS THIS IDIOM:
"I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
CHANGING THE GRID PLAN".
SHE'S REALLY, UH,
ALIGNING HERSELF...
WITH THIS CIVILIZATION.
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "I CAN'T IMAGINE
ALTERING THIS CIVILIZATION.
"I CAN'T IMAGINE ALTERING
THIS MEEK AND LYING MORALITY...
"THAT RULES OUR LIVES.
"CAN'T IMAGINE STANDING UP ON A
CHAIR IN THE ROOM...
"TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVE.
"I CAN'T IMAGINE CHANGING
MY MIND ON ANYTHING.
"I, IN THE END, CAN'T IMAGINE
HAVING MY OWN IDENTITY...
THAT CONTRADICTS
OTHER IDENTITIES".
WHEN SHE SAYS TO ME,
AFTER MY STATEMENTS,
"EVERYONE LIKES
THE GRID PLAN,"
ISN'T SHE AUTOMATICALLY
EXCLUDING MYSELF FROM "EVERYONE"?
HOW COULD YOU NOT LIKE
THE GRID PLAN?
IT'S SO FUNCTIONAL.
YOU TAKE A RIGHT TURN,
A RIGHT TURN, A RIGHT TURN.
THERE'S A RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT,
YELLOW LIGHT. IT'S SO SYMMETRICAL.
BY SAYING THAT EVERYONE
LIKES THE GRID PLAN,
YOU'RE SAYING, "I'M GOING TO RELIVE
ALL THE MISTAKES MY PARENTS MADE.
"I'M GOING TO IDENTIFY
AND RELIVE ALL THE SORROWS...
"MY MOTHER EVER
LIVED THROUGH.
"I WILL PROPAGATE AND CREATE
DYSFUNCTIONAL CHILDREN...
"IN THE SAME DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY
THAT I WAS RAISED.
"I WILL SPREAD NEUROSIS
THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE...
"AND DO MY BEST...
"TO RECREATE MYSELF
AND THE DAMAGES OF MY LIFE...
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION".
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL MAPS
OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,
EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THIS CENTURY,
MADISON AVENUE,
IN FRONT OF YOU, IN BACK OF YOU,
IS NOT EVEN ON THE MAP.
THIS BEGINS AS A SERVICE ROAD
FOR FIFTH AVENUE,
ONE BLOCK TO THE WEST.
FIFTH AVENUE IS
"MILLIONAIRE'S ROW,"
A SYSTEM OF
ARISTOCRATIC MANSIONS.
THIS IS WHERE
THE HORSE STABLES ARE.
THIS IS WHERE THE GARDENERS'
SHACKS ARE, NOT THAT LONG AGO.
MADISON AVENUE,
NOT EVEN A BOULEVARD...
UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE
TAKES OVER THE ISLAND.
WILL YOU LOOK AT IT TODAY.
MAY I RESTATE, RECAPITULATE...
AND GENERALLY REGURGITATE,
WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN THE
MIDDLE OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,
YOU ARE SITTING AMONGST
A 20th-CENTURY INVENTION,
A CITY THAT GREW UP
AT AN EXPLOSION, AS AN EXPLOSION.
IT IS AN EXPLOSION,
AN EXPERIMENT,
A SYSTEM OF TEST TUBES GURGLING,
BOILING OUT OF CONTROL,
A RADIOACTIVE ATOM
SWIRLING.
CIVILIZATION HAS NEVER
LOOKED LIKE THIS BEFORE.
THIS IS LUDICROUSNESS,
AND THIS CANNOT LAST.
THE NEW ANN TAYLOR STORE
ON THE RIGHT.
YESTERDAY GRAY LINE
FINALLY ENFORCED THEIR, UH,
UM, OBLIGATORY
UNIFORM POLICY.
IT'S A NEW POLICY.
WE HAVE TO--
ALL THE TOUR GUIDES HAVE TO WEAR...
GRAY LINE
BRIGHT RED SHIRTS.
AND CERTAINLY MY ILLNESS,
I THINK, IS ASSOCIATED...
WITH THIS LATEST
LEGISLATION.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT I CAME...
TO THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS
FOR EMPLOYMENT...
FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE ESSENTIAL REASON ONLY,
AND THAT WAS TO, UH,
MEET WOMEN,
TO MEET AND SEDUCE WOMEN...
FROM EVERY HABITABLE
CONTINENT IN THE WORLD.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
HERE FOR THE MONEY.
AND, UM, THEY'RE JUST
LITERALLY BLOWING MY SHTICK.
I SAID TO GEORGE YESTERDAY,
BECAUSE
THE DISPATCHERS BASICALLY SAID,
"IF YOU DON'T PUT ON THAT SHIRT,
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU HOME EARLY".
IT CAN LEAD
TO MY TERMINATION.
THAT'S HOW SERIOUS
THEY ARE ABOUT THIS.
I SAID, "AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,
"THE OFFICIAL GRAY LINE POLICY
AT THIS POINT IS, YOU KNOW,
"'SPEED, YOU ARE NOT GONNA
GET LAID ON OUR BUSES.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE'."
THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE ME PULL A SHTICK...
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS PULLIN',
AND IT'S TERRIBLE.
AND, UH, REALLY,
MOSTLY IT'S JUST THE REGIME
SENDING OUT A MESSAGE...
THAT I'M ENTIRELY REPLACEABLE.
IT'S THEM SAYING,
"WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR TOUR.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
"YOU WEAR THIS SHIRT, AND IF
YOU DON'T CONFORM, YOU'RE OUT,
'CAUSE WE CAN REPLACE YOU".
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS CITY
RIGHT NOW IS SEVEN PERCENT.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IN FRONT OF US.
"ANTI,"
AS OPPOSED TO "CRUISE".
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY AND VERY
PHYSICAL EXAMPLE OF ANTI-CRUISE,
WHERE OUR IMMOBILITY...
IS CREATED BY LITERALLY
JUST A BLOCKADE OF THE SIDEWALK.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS EVERYWHERE.
EVERY GOOD DAY OF MY LIFE
IS A DAY I EVADE THE ANTI-CRUISE.
PLEASE KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,
'CAUSE I DO SENSE A LOT OF THAT
NEGATIVE FODDER IN THE AIR.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT THIS IS A VERY
ECLECTIC AND DANGEROUS AFTERNOON.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS CERTAINLY MOBILIZED TODAY.
ON OUR LEFT WILL BE
THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE,
CAPITAL OF INCARCERATION.
INCARCERATION, ANOTHER BASIC
ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES,
UTILIZED
IN AN UNORIGINAL WAY...
IN THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE
ON OUR LEFT.
AND I CAN PERSONALLY
VOUCH FOR THAT.
THE ANTI-CRUISE IS AN ATTEMPT
TO IMPRISON US.
AT EVERY LEVEL OF LIVING,
IT EXISTS.
YOUNGER CRUISERS
HAVE ASKED ME, "WHY?
"WHY IS THE ANTI-CRUISE
SO AVARICIOUS AND CONSTANT...
IN ITS ATTEMPT
TO STOP THE CRUISE?"
AND I HAVE NO ANSWER.
THERE IS NO ANSWER.
I MEAN,
IT'S GRAVITATIONAL.
IT'S A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S
MADE UP OF RECIPROCALS...
AND OF PULLING GRAVITIES.
IT SIMPLY EXISTS.
WHERE THERE IS CRUISE,
THERE IS AN ESCORT OF ANTI-CRUISE.
BUT EVEN IN A COMPLETE BASTION...
OF ANTI-CRUISE FODDER,
WHICH THIS ENTIRE
SQUARE BLOCK IS,
THERE IS CRUISE.
SOMEWHERE IN THERE IS
A SPARKLE OF CRUISING ENERGY...
DEEPLY SUBLIMATED WITHIN THE
BELLOWING BELLY OF THE BEAST.
SURVIVOR.
HE KNOWS NO PRISON.
THEY WERE ALL OVER
THE PRISON FLOOR,
BUT YOU NEVER SAW THEM
LOOKING MELANCHOLY.
THEY KEPT CRUISIN'.
NO IMPRISONMENT
FOR THE COCKROACH.
LIFE-IMPENDING
DRASTIC SURVIVOR.
THROUGH THE MILLENNIAS,
THROUGH THE ERUPTIONS OF TIME,
PAST THE DINOSAURS,
WITNESSING THE FLIGHT
OF BIRDS FOR THE FIRST TIME,
CLOUDS DYING,
ASTEROIDS HITTING THE EARTH.
NO PRISON FOR THE COCKROACH.
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT
FOR THOSE BASTARDS.
BUT I WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS
CRUISING HARD AT THAT TIME,
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT--
THE ANTI-CRUISE REALLY
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK...
COULD NOT ALLOW ME
EVEN PHYSICAL MOBILITY.
I WAS-- ACCORDING TO THEM,
I WAS RUNNING FROM
THE COPS FOR A MONTH...
BEFORE THEY CAUGHT UP TO ME.
I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE
THAT I WAS RUNNING FROM THE COPS...
AS MUCH AS FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE.
I FELT LIKE A FUGITIVE,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERY DAY I FEEL
LIKE A FUGITIVE.
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THEM...
THAT I'M RUNNING
FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE EVERY DAY.
WHEN I WAS UP IN FRONT OF THE
JUDGE FOR MY ARRAIGNMENT,
THE JUDGE SAID,
"MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH
THIS CASE IS THAT THIS GUY--
"THIS CURRENT PERSON
WE'RE JUDGING--
RAN FROM THE POLICE
FOR A MONTH".
IF I COULD HAVE SPOKEN-- OF COURSE,
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO SPEAK--
I WOULD HAVE SAID,
"IT'S BEEN A LOT MORE THAN A MONTH.
"I'VE BEEN RUNNING
FROM YOU PEOPLE ALL MY LIFE.
ALL MY LIFE.
AND I'M GONNA KEEP RUNNING".
THERE ARE SO MANY PRISONERS,
INMATES, SO MANY
PEOPLE TO BE JUDGED,
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO
CONSIDER YOU AS A HUMAN BEING.
YOU'RE FILED THROUGH
AS IN AN ASSEMBLY LINE.
IN SOME WAYS,
IT MADE ME THINK OF THE FACT THAT
IN TERMS OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,
WE HAVE THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE
AS PLANTS.
SO THIS ENTIRE
NOTION OF INDIVIDUALITY...
IS A DELUSION ANYWAY.
IT IS A DIREFUL DELUSION.
THERE IS NO REAL INDIVIDUALITY
EXCEPT FOR THAT WHICH WE PROJECT.
BUT SITTING IN THE CELL BLOCK,
I REALIZED THAT THE PURSUIT OF
THAT SO-CALLED INDIVIDUALITY...
IS EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN.
THE FULLEST PURSUIT OF THOSE...
POSSIBILITIES OF THAT
"INDIVIDUALITY,"
EVEN IF IT IS
AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE,
IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
FAILURE I CAN THINK OF.
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S A DELUSION.
I DON'T CARE IF WE HAVE
THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE AS PLANTS.
I WANT TO BE THE PLANT
THAT GROWS THE HIGHEST.
I WANT TO BE THE BEAN STALK.
I WANT TO BE THE FLOWER...
THAT SMELLS MOST PROFUSELY,
THAT VEERS MOST DRASTICALLY
TOWARDS THE SUNLIGHT.
LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL
LEAVES, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
YOU SEE THAT?
SEE HOW STUBBORN THIS LEAF IS?
I'M TRYING TO PICK IT UP, LIKE LOOK,
PICK UP THE SPIRIT.
LIKE PICK IT UP NOW.
LET'S GET SOME EXPANSION.
LET'S GET SOME ERECTION GOIN'.
HE'S LIKE, "I'M FLACCID. I'M NOT
MOVIN'. I'M NOT DOIN' IT TODAY".
COME ON, IT'S WEST 67th STREET.
IT'S SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
IT'S AUGUST. DO THIS.
"NO, NO, NO".
COME ON, GET IT UP.
"NO, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TODAY".
COME ON NOW!
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HE'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
DIFFERENT COLOR,
DIFFERENT ATTITUDE.
LOOK AT THAT STYLE.
AND THEY MOVE WITH YOU.
THEY'VE GOT SUCH MOBILITY THERE.
THIS GUY'S LIKE STREAMLINED,
LIKE SEXY.
SO SEXY.
LOOK AT THOSE LINES.
AN AIRPLANE.
BEAUTIFUL.
GOTTA RISE.
RISE.
RISE TO THE OCCASION.
THESE PEOPLE ARE
ON THE 12:00 DOWN,
AND THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME.
THE 12:00 DOWN ON THIS PARTICULAR
DAY WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE
UNDERSTANDING THAT RIGHT NOW.
LOOK AT THIS.
RISE.
GO FOR IT.
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD LUCK.
I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE VICTORY
IS THE ABILITY TO FEEL.
SUCH INSINCERITY--
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IF THE CRUISE IS ANYTHING,
BE IT APPRECIATION, BE IT A VOYAGE,
BE IT AN ADVENTURE
THAT LEADS BACK TO OURSELVES,
BE IT A CARTWHEEL
OR A SOMERSAULT--
IF YOU FIND THE CRUISE IN A PIECE
OF CARROT CAKE, A TOPLESS BAR,
THE ONE THING THE CRUISE
ALWAYS IS, I THINK, IS SINCERE.
AND SINCERITY IS ONE OF MY
FAVORITE VICTORIES IN THIS LIFETIME.
I MEAN, HOW MUCH REBELLION
DID I HAVE TO EXPERIENCE?
HOW MUCH FIGHTING DID I DO?
HOW MANY TIMES DID
I HAVE TO IGNORE...
MY FATHER'S INABILITY TO EMOTE?
HOW WE ALL IGNORE OUR FATHERS'
INABILITY TO EMOTE IN OUR PRESENCE.
HOW MUCH AIR-CONDITIONING
DID I HAVE TO TRANSCEND...
AND THE COMFORT
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT?
THE COMFORTABLE COUCHES,
THE TELEVISION,
THE MAGNITUDE OF STATIC
THAT SURROUNDS US.
HOW MUCH DAILY INFIGHTING,
STRATEGIZING, EVADING, RUNNING...
DID I HAVE TO DO
FOR THE ABILITY TO FEEL,
FOR THE ABILITY TO EMOTE,
FOR THE SIMPLE MOMENTS
WHEN I FEEL ACTUAL PASSION?
HELLO, EVERYONE.
CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THE BACK?
WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY.
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE
THAT TO TELL
THE SOCIAL HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...
IS TO TELL THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD, THE STORY OF THE WORLD.
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LONG MORNING.
TO ALL MY ENEMIES
WHO ADD FLAVOR TO MY LIFE,
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT?
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
AND TALK TO ME ABOUT IT?
TO LESLIE LINDENSTRAUS:
LOOK, IF YOU WANNA TRY TO CHOKE
ME WHEN I'M, LIKE, PREPUBESCENT...
AND REALLY MUCH SMALLER
THAN YOU, THAT'S FINE.
I KNOW THAT'S HOW WE ALL
REALLY FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER,
AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT
IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT.
BUT I'M GONNA FIND YOU AND KICK
YOUR ASS 'CAUSE I'M NOT SEVEN...
AND PREPUBESCENT ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE,
BUT I REMEMBER THAT DAY.
TO JORDAN:
LOOK, BANANAS MAY BE SOMETHING...
THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
CAN EAT WITHOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?
YES, I WANTED A BANANA
AND YES, YOU LEFT ME OUT.
BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE
THERE ARE OTHER BANANAS.
I THINK I PROVED THAT
TO YOU BY NOW.
TO TIRZAH:
THERE WAS ABOUT TWO HOURS OF
MY ENTIRE LIFE THUS FAR ON EARTH...
WHEN I WAS ABSOLUTELY
DEPENDENT UPON YOU.
AND THOSE WERE A COUPLE
OF THE WORST HOURS OF MY LIFE.
TO CHARLES PURPURRA: I KNOW
YOU NEVER READ MY SCREENPLAY.
AND TO LESLIE LEE: I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T READ THAT FULL-LENGTH PLAY.
I WORKED ON IT. I SWEATED
ON IT. I TURMOILED OVER IT.
I MALAISED THROUGH IT.
I LIVED ABOVE IT, UNDER IT,
BECAUSE OF IT, NOT BECAUSE OF IT.
I HATED IT. I LOVED IT.
I DIED AND I WAS REBORN WITHIN THE
ROOM AS I WORKED ON THAT PLAY,
AND I KNOW
YOU DID NOT READ IT.
TO SWAYNE,
WHO SUPPOSEDLY WAS GOING
TO READ THAT SCRIPT I GAVE HIM.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
FUCK THE SCRIPT.
YOU ARE FOREVER KNOWN
AS THE TOUR GUIDE...
WHO GOT HIT BY A TRAFFIC LIGHT.
AND I THINK THAT'S
THE PROPER EPITHET FOR YOU.
AND HOW DARE YOU
DO A TINA HOWE PLAY...
IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE
IN NEW YORK CITY,
AS IF I HAVE TIME TO SIT THERE
AND LISTEN TO THAT TRASH...
WHEN THERE IS SHTICKING
AND CRUISING TO BE DONE.
YOU OBVIOUSLY LEAD
AN "INFINTESTIMIAL" EXISTENCE.
TO JOSH:
YOUR NARCISSISM...
IS MEDIOCRE.
NARCISSISM IN SOME WAYS
IS INEVITABLE.
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE ALL LIVING IN
THE SAME BODIES FOR THIS MORTALITY,
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE
THAT WE WILL BE...
SELF-ABSORBED AT SOME POINT.
BUT WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
HAVE A NARCISSISM AS YOURSELF...
THAT LEADS TO MEDIOCRITY
AND NOTHING ELSE?
TO JEN AND MICHELLE:
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ORGY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT
CAME DOWN TO A DOUBLE DATE...
WITH ME AS A FIFTH WHEEL.
THAT SUCKS. I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A SITUATION WHERE I'VE BEEN...
SO SEVERELY DISSED.
I MEAN, AN ORGY IS WHEN
EVERYBODY PARTICIPATES,
NOT FOUR OUT OF FIVE IN THE ROOM.
TO RAELLE:
I AM NOT GOING TO GO
TO SOME SINGLE JEWISH PARTY...
BECAUSE I'M A DISHEVELLED
WRECK OF A SHTICKER...
TO TRY TO MEET
SOME LONG ISLAND JEWESS...
AND LAND ON A FRONT YARD
IN A HOUSE WITH TWO CARS...
AND CHILDREN WHO
BAWL MY NAME...
THROUGH THEIR OWN
SALIVARY GLANDS.
THAT MAY BE YOUR APPROXIMATE
GOAL, BUT THAT IS NOT MINE.
I AM SURPRISED
BY YOUR UNORIGINALITY,
AND I AM TIRED
OF YOUR SILLY EMASCULATIONS.
I WOULD PREFER TO BE
EMASCULATED BY A WOMAN...
WITH MUCH MORE SEVERITY...
AND WITH A LITTLE BIT
MORE BACKBONE.
TO MEM LEVITCH:
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?
I'M TRYING TO LEAD SOMETHING
OF A YOUTHFUL EXISTENCE HERE.
I'M STANDING HERE
ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE TODAY...
TALKING TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
ABOUT THE MINUSCULE
MOMENTS OF ALIENATION...
THAT I REMEMBER SO WELL
OVER THE LAST QUARTER CENTURY,
AND ALL YOU CAN DO
IS LEAVE MESSAGES ON MY MACHINE...
AND LECTURE ME ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU NEED ME...
UP THERE IN WESTCHESTER.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
CHECK THE AIR IN YOUR TIRES?
YOU NEVER ONCE VAULTED
OUT OF THE GOLDEN CHAIR.
YOU NEVER HAD THE GUTS,
THE AUDACITY,
TO STAND UP AND DO
SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.
YOU COULD ONLY UTILIZE
YOUR OWN NARCISSISMS...
AND YOUR OWN SELF-ABSORPTION...
TO ALWAYS, IN A TONAL SENSE,
IMPLY TO ME, YOUR CHILD,
THAT I HAD TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.
AND THIS HAS BEEN A DAILY CRUSADE
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF MY BIRTH.
AND WHEN I EMANATED
FROM YOUR BLOODY THIGHS,
IF I'D KNOWN ALL THIS, I'M SURE
I WOULD HAVE CRAWLED BACK IN.
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
ALL THE MENSTRUATION...
THAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT...
WAS PARTS OF MYSELF LEFT BEHIND
THAT YOU WERE CHOKING TO DEATH?
THAT WAS MY BLOOD!
"WHEN I STOOD ATOP
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
"OVERLOOKING
THE BROOKLYN NAVY YARD,
"I FELT SEVERED
FROM HUMANITY,
"FROM THE ACTIVITIES
OF HUMANITY, FROM MAN HIMSELF,
"STARING AT BROOKLYN
AND THEN MANHATTAN.
"IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
WHICH DIRECTION I WALKED IN.
EITHER WAY WAS HELL".
HENRY MILLER,
TROPIC OF CAPRICORN.
AND A GOOD LITERARY DESCRIPTION...
OF A NEW YORK CITY
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
TIMES SQUARE,
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,
GREENWICH VILLAGE,
STOP AT BLEECKER AND LAGUARDIA,
THROUGH SOHO,
RIGHT ON BROADWAY,
CHINATOWN/SOHO/LITTLE ITALY
STOP. HELLO.
WORLD TRADE CENTERS,
BATTERY PARK,
STATUE OF LIBERTY, OF COURSE,
SOUTH STREET SEAPORT, WALL STREET,
UP THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE
OF CHINATOWN, UP FIRST AVENUE,
DELANCEY AND ALLEN,
ORCHARD STREET FLEA MARKET,
THE UNITED NATIONS,
ACROSS 49th STREET,
THE WALDORF-ASTORIA SHTICK,
PARK AVENUE ON EITHER SIDE
OF YOU, UP MADISON AVENUE,
CENTRAL PARK SOUTH STOP,
DOWN TO ROCKEFELLER CENTER,
BACK TO THE TERMINAL.
THAT'S LIFE.
LIFE--
A CIRCLE WROUGHT
WITH DESTINATIONS.
PEOPLE CONSTANTLY JUMPING OFF THE
BUS AND JUMPING BACK ONTO THE BUS.
SEA LIONS.
NABOBS.
THE CIRCLE.
WHEN YOU CROSS THE STREET
CALLED HOUSTON STREET,
YOU ENTER THE DISTRICT
CALLED SOHO,
WHICH STANDS
FOR "SOUTH OF HOUSTON".
AND AS WE
ENTER SOHO TODAY,
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT...
TO DEDICATE THIS CRUISE
AND THIS ENTRANCE INTO SOHO...
TO OUR DRIVER AND NAVIGATOR
DOWNSTAIRS, BENITEZ.
IN A CERTAIN PERSONAL
DESPAIR TODAY,
I WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT I AM WITH HIM,
AND I'M BACKING HIM UP ALL THE WAY.
WE'VE DONE
MANY CIRCLES TOGETHER,
AND TOGETHER
WE'VE SUFFERED, AS WE ENTER SOHO.
WE'RE CROSSING HOUSTON STREET
RIGHT NOW. CAN YOU FEEL IT?
BENITEZ,
CAN YOU FEEL IT?
WE'RE ENTERING SOHO.
I WROTE JON A LETTER ABOUT
THE, UH, LAMED VOVNIKS.
UM--
THE, UH-- FROM
THE ANCIENT CABALA.
THIRTY-SIX, UH, IN HEBREW--
LAMED VOVNIK.
I BELIEVE IT MEANS 36.
AND, ESSENTIALLY,
IT DISCUSSES HOW THERE ARE 36
HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET...
AT ALL TIMES-- ONLY 36--
WHO, UH, UPHOLD AND
CREATE THE EQUILIBRIUM...
FOR ALL OF OUR SUFFERINGS.
THEY TAKE THE MALAISE AND
THE MAELSTROM OF PERSECUTIONS...
AND THE DISASTERS OF THE WORLD
ONTO THEIR OWN SHOULDERS,
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE,
THROUGHOUT THEIR
FLESH-PHYSICAL-INCARNATED LIVES.
AND WITHOUT THESE 36 PEOPLE,
THE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF THE WORLD WOULD FALL APART...
AND THERE WOULD BE ARMAGEDDON
AND PERHAPS THE FINAL JUDGMENT,
BUT NOT A PRETTY JUDGMENT,
BY ANY MEANS.
FINAL BUT NOT PRETTY.
MOST OF THE VOVNIKS
DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY'RE VOVNIKS.
THEY SUFFER
IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE HELL,
AND THEY SWIM IN AN ENTIRE
WHIRLPOOL OF HUMILITY...
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THEMSELVES OR WHO THEY ARE...
OR THEIR IMPORTANCE
IN THE WORLD.
AND THE VOVNIK MORDECAI,
WHO LEFT THE LARGE FAMILY
OF THE LEVIS...
TO MOVE TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA,
UH, IN THE 17th CENTURY,
WHERE THE BAAL SHEM TOV
HAD SET UP CRUISING HEADQUARTERS...
AND INSTITUTED THE BEGINNINGS OF
THE HASIDIM, HASIDIC RELIGION.
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV,
THE ENLIGHTENED RABBI,
PREACHING THE CARNIVOROUSNESS
AND THE RELIGIOSITY IN JOY...
AND THE ECSTASY OF PRAYER.
I MEAN, THE HASIDS ARE NO LONGER
GOING TO SIT WITH PRAYER BOOKS,
YOU KNOW, SILENTLY PRAYING
IN DARKENED SYNAGOGUES.
THEY ARE GOING
TO JUMP AROUND THE ROOM.
THEY ARE GOING TO SCREAM
AND YELL THEIR LOVE FOR GOD.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO CARTWHEELS.
AND MORDECAI WENT THERE
TO HELP CLEAN OUT OUTHOUSES.
BASICALLY, HE WAS A PEASANT
LIVING IN THE TOWN.
DERELICTS AND BUMS AND GENIUSES
AND ARISTOCRATS AND POETS...
AND MEN OF EVERY KIND
OF OCCUPATION AND PHYLUM...
WERE GOING TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA...
JUST TO HAVE THEIR OWN MOMENTS
WITH THE BAAL SHEM TOV,
THIS ENLIGHTENED RABBI.
AND MORDECAI REVERENTLY
STOOD IN THE SAME ROOM...
WITH THE BAAL
SHEM TOV A FEW TIMES...
AS HE WENT OFF
TO DO HIS DAILY TOIL.
EVENTUALLY, THEY CALLED HIM
"THE DANCER OF GOD,"
BECAUSE WHEN THE HASIDS WOULD
FORM FOR THEIR REELS OF DANCE...
IN HONOR TO THEIR ECSTASY
TO THEIR GOD,
MORDECAI WOULD JUMP SO HIGH...
AND WOULD DANCE
WITH SUCH AN EXUBERANCE,
THE OTHER HASIDICS WERE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT HIM...
AND FOR HIM,
AND HE WAS EXILED
FROM THE DANCE.
AND SO HE APPEASED HIMSELF
BY DANCING ALONE AT NIGHT...
IN THE SHED RESERVED
FOR THE SICK AND DYING,
AND HE WOULD ENTERTAIN THEM
IN THE EVENINGS ALONE.
SUDDENLY,
THE GAON OF KIEV WHISPERS TO
THE BAAL SHEM TOV ONE DAY...
THAT THERE IS A VOVNIK,
UH, A HOLY, UH, MAN.
THEY HAVE
ANOTHER TERM FOR IT.
A MAN OF TOTAL EQUILIBRIUM,
A LAMED VOVNIK, IN TOWN.
AND SO THEY START SEARCHING
FOR WHO THIS MIGHT BE.
THEY INTERVIEW THE DERELICTS.
THEY INTERVIEW ALL THE PEASANTS.
THEY INTERVIEW THE HANDYMEN.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE GUYS WHO
HANG OUT WITH FARM ANIMALS,
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT
BE MENTALLY RETARDED,
AS MANY VOVNIKS
ARE MENTALLY RETARDED.
SUDDENLY, THEY REALIZE THAT THE
GUY WHO CLEANS THE OUTHOUSES...
DISAPPEARS THE NEXT MORNING.
SUDDENLY,
RUMORS SPREAD AROUND.
THEY SAY TO THE BAAL SHEM TOV, "HE
DANCED FOR THE SICK AT NIGHT ALONE.
HE CLEANED THE OUTHOUSES
CONSCIENTIOUSLY".
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV WOOED
THEM AWAY, PUSHED THEM AWAY,
AND WAS CRYING.
AND THERE WAS SILENCE.
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV
SAID SIMPLY,
"THAT ONE WAS HEALTHY
AMONGST THE SICK,
AND I DID NOT SEE HIM".
- IS THAT OPEN?
- YEAH. THANKS, LARRY.
- HOW YA BEEN?
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?

I WAS GONNA

BUT AFTER I HEARD
THE WEATHER REPORT, I SAID NO.
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'VE PAID MY DUES.
WELL, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF CIRCLES.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT
THERE'S A FINISH LINE TO THIS.
I FIND THAT--
I FIND THAT INTERESTING.
THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF LOOKING AT IT,
MAN. -IT'S BEEN SO NICE TO KNOW YOU.
- IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE.
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN A DAMN PLEASURE.
- YEAH, BUT I'LL BE AROUND.

YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MUCH MONEY. -THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
AND KEEP IT ALIVE.
244 EAST 49th STREET...
WILL BE A QUIET,
BROWN ROW HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NEXT BLOCK ON YOUR LEFT,
STILL CURRENTLY
THE NEW YORK CITY RESIDENCE...
OF KATHARINE HEPBURN.
GRETA GARBO AND BETTE DAVIS,
WHEN THEY WERE BOTH LIVING,
ALSO HAD RESIDENCES
ON THIS NEXT BLOCK.
WHEN THEY ASKED GRETA GARBO WHY
SHE CHOSE TO LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY,
SHE SAID THAT NEW YORK
WAS THE ONLY PLACE...
WHERE SHE COULD BE... ALONE.
I AM CRUISING CURRENTLY...
RIGHT NOW.
I AM CRUISING BECAUSE
I HAVE DEDICATED MYSELF...
TO ALL THAT IS CREATIVE AND
DESTRUCTIVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.
AND I'M EQUALLY IN LOVE
WITH EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE...
AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TURMOIL...
AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME GLORY.
I AM THE LIVING WHISPERED WARNING
IN THE ROMAN GENERAL'S EAR,
"GLORY IS FLEETING".
AND IN THAT VERB,
THAT ACTIVE VERB, "FLEETING,"
THERE I LIVE,
THERE I RESIDE IN THIS MOMENT.
I'VE DEDICATED MYSELF
TO THE IDIOM, "I DON'T KNOW".
AND I'M IN LOVE WITH THE FRANTIC
CHAOS OF THIS LIMITLESS UNIVERSE.
I'VE FACED THIS BEFORE.
THE SECOND TO LAST TIME
I TRIED IT, IT DIDN'T GO OFF,
AND I FOUND MYSELF
OVERLOOKING 42nd STREET.
I WAS, LIKE,
EXACTLY 45 FLOORS UP,
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE CHRYSLER BUILDING.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
THE LAST TIME I TRIED IT,
I STOOD ATOP
THE MARRIOTT MARQUIS HOTEL,
THINKING THAT I HAD
SO GLORIOUSLY ONCE AGAIN EVADED...
THE ANTI-CRUISE
FIRE EXIT SIGNALS...
AND THEN WAS
SUDDENLY SURROUNDED...
BY TWO FIRE DEPARTMENTS PEOPLE,
HEAD OF SECURITY.
LECTURE, REPRIMAND.
I BARELY GOT OUT
OF THERE ALIVE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A KEY BEFORE, THOUGH.
SEEMS TO ME
IT'S THE POTENTIAL OF TURNING IT OFF,
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS ON AND WHAT IS OFF.

"Was this collection half-full
or half-empty?
"That was the obvious question after
Isaac Mizrahi's show Thursday night.
"What he dubbed a mix
was more of a mess.
"His usually great color sense failed him; His fabric sense failed him.
And certainly, his sense of how a modern woman dresses after 8:00 P.M. failed him."
It's just the worst day
in the world after the show.
I just hate the...
I hate waking up.
I hate not sleeping after I've
just worked so hard, you know?
Worrying about the reviews
the next day.
I don't really take criticism
very well, I don't think,
but I've learned to sort of...
it's painful, you know.
I don't have a very...
actually, I have a very low threshold of pain, but... physical pain, anyway.
I'm a baby even when I go for a facial or something. I can't stand it.
But the thing is,
I... I hate, like, mediocre things said about me.
I hate, uh... you know, I hate that...
Because, you know, you either say something's great or say it stank...
Or ignore it, you know?
That's how I feel. Ignore... ignore it if you don't like it.
¶¶
¶ hmm-hmm-hmm ¶
¶ oh, you make me feel ¶
¶ mighty real ¶
¶ San Francisco ¶
¶ I say you make me feel ¶
¶ mighty real ¶
¶ Sylvester, sister you're an angel walking among us ¶
¶ on the face of this earth ¶
¶ you were so beautiful
you were so fragile ¶
¶ you were so real ¶¶
here's my process:
I get inspired, somehow, somewhere... from the ballet, from a dance, from a movie, something.
I get this gesture in my head.
Then I think, like, is this worthy of doing a whole collection?
Usually it is, because it's the only thing I can think of.
And from there, I just do all these millions of sketches...
About that one gesture. That's a chesterfield with the astrakhan trim.
And I work with annica.
They make patterns.
This would be coyote and that would be beast, let's say, trim.
We make them out of muslin first.
Muslin is this inexpensive thing that you make just to see the shape...
- And balance of everything.
- Don't you want a bigger sleeve?
Definitely. I want more here.
- Then we do fabric fittings.
- That would be much better, wouldn't it?
We book the girls, we plan the show, we plan the figures.
What gets annoying is actually when it becomes like a giant puzzle.
Things have to be taken out for certain reasons.
Things have to be added in this very kind of clever way.
That's when it becomes grating on my nerves, because it's no longer about creating a look; It's about creating a show.
This is for a 750 girl. 750 dollars an hour for four hours.
- What's an average girl?
- Five-ten.
Okay. And do you do shows?
Mm-hmm.
Can I watch you walk? Sure.
Hi, Amber. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
How pretty you are.
Thank you. What a pleasure.
Can you take your clothes off?
Just the jacket.
Take all your clothes off.
Where are you from?
Oklahoma. Oklahoma?
You're such a liar.
I swear to God.
Can you stand up a second?
And take your things off?
Thank you.
Let's see. You've done a million shows?
 A million.
A million? Yeah, like her.
Thick shoulders, which is good.
Isaac Mizrahi.
Take these off.
Can you see without them?
Of course.
And is this how you're gonna keep your hair? No.
You're gonna shave it more?
Yeah.
Normally, it's like you. Bald.
Like my face. Okay.
Great. Thank you.
Thank you to you.
I'll see you maybe.
Have a nice day.
You too. Bye.
Yes, I did.
I'm sitting here and I'm watching nanook of the north.
Oh, it's so amazing, isn't it?
And it's so inspiring...
I can't even believe...
How beautiful these eskimos are.
And I love they all have fur pants, and the thing is, all I want to do is fur pants.
But I know if I do them, I'll get stoned off of seventh Avenue...
Like some wanton heretic
or something.
So there won't be any fur pants
coming down my runway.
It's about women not wanting to look like cows, I guess, you know.
And, in fact, there's something very charming about cows.
Anyway, you know what I mean.
There's something very charming about a big, fat fur pant.
Actually, there was one thing I wanted to do, which was a fur jumpsuit.
Like the banana splits. You know, those big, kind of giant...
I mean, I would love to have one of those in beast... let's say in beast fur, to walk the dog in or something.
You don't to think about anything; You just have your bra and panties on.
You just put this giant fur jumpsuit on, head to toe, hood and little hush puppy boots or something.
You're out walking the dog and looking amazing, surprising everyone in your neighborhood,
which, in this case, would probably be Upper East Side or Alaska.
You know, that which is our standard hood, right?
What I'm trying to do is... Douglas has this fantastic down coat.
It's a drop shoulder, and yet it wants to be smaller at the waist...
And just be this little shape like that.
What I want to discuss this morning are those embroideries of eskimos.
These are simple. They're just gonna put into work, and boom, they're done.
You know what I mean? It's like a little tulle skirt with a long pony skin skirt.
That looks like an eskimo. I just don't want it to resemble at all those Indian things.
And it shouldn't,
because it doesn't.
I am loving that; Look at that adorable shape.
 Isn't that cute?
Oh, isn't that adorable?
Adorable. Adorable!
How 'bout the clothes you made for
Norman and Marilyn's wedding?
Oh, my God. Those were so embarrassing.
Embarrassing?
They were so awful. The whole town was talking about the wedding clothes.
They were so bad.
They were so beautiful.
Embarrassing. It was... I don't know, it was like a straitjacket.
It was completely straight.
I didn't care. I wore it.
I wore it on the holy holidays, the biggest holiday.
I came in and I was so proud.
I said, "my Isaac made this."
Every single morning on my way to school when I was really young,
I used to steal into your room while you were both asleep.
You took money? I used to take money every day.
You took money? I can't believe you never figured it out.
I thought for sure you knew that I was doing it. Isaac!
I would take money and go to midwood trimmings and buy all these fabrics.
Hmm. It's so true.
Mm-hmm.
It's really true. So I didn't tell you about eartha kitt, did I?
Oh, honey, we went up to visit her.
It was amazing.
Yes, in scheherazade, right?
You go to le chien on Saturday to get yourself all dressed up.
It's almost impossible to have any style at all without the right dogs.
You should have seen how chic it was to have these two poodles flooding out of the room.
I just don't know what to say, honestly.
Is that why you're gonna make gowns for me?
Yes, I am, I'm gonna make gowns for you!
That is how she referred to it.
She said, "will you make me gowns?
Ah-ha-ha-ha."
I was like, "are you kidding? I will make you nothing but gowns."
This is like... I can't wait.
She was like, "something where
I can really move around."
Do all sorts of crazy, wonderful things, you know, so that it doesn't restrict me.
It's got to be a dress that I can do everything in, you know.
R-r-r-r-r-r! You know.
- R-r-r-r-r-r!
¶ R-r-rum tee Dee dum Dee dum tee dum tee dum tee Dee dum tee ¶¶ you have to see this book that she gave me.
It's called eartha kitt:
Confessions of a sex kitten.
I loved working with Orson welles, this huge man.
And I had a song to sing.
She does this song, and he's supposed to kiss her, and instead, he bit her...
And she started bleeding on stage.
Oh, my God!
So she starts bleeding on stage, and she was furious.
After the show she went to his dressing room... "'Orson, why did you bite me?' he pushed me aside like a little mouse." That's how she said it.
"He pushed me aside like a little mouse.
And he said, 'I got excited.'" that was it? "'I got excited'."
¶ Santa, cutie, there's
one thing I really do need ¶
¶ the deed to a platinum mine ¶
¶ Santa, cutie, and hurry
down the chimney tonight ¶
¶ Santa, baby, and fill my stocking with a duplex ¶

I had this preview with candy pratts, and it went really well.
She adored what I showed her, which is, you know, a good indication,
'cause candy would tell me;
She would say she hated it.
She wouldn't say she hated it, but she would indicate to me that it wasn't working.
Just between you and I,
I'm sort of feeling for, like, color in this way.
I'm not fond of plaids like that.
Forget the... Forget the plaids.
What about those colors?
I like stronger color than that.
Stronger color? Stronger color.
- Really? Now I'm totally confused.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Just one amazing color, like if you have a long matte Jersey dress like that.
It looks heaven.
What I think happens... and this is totally off camera.
Sound on this one should be turned off because that's not right.
- Turn it off.
- Avocado?
That's chicken with Pesto.
 Ooh.
And this is? Here's what the ouija board said last night.
He wasn't looking at the board, and I was calling out letters.
Ouija board was saying, "sexy, sexy," and I'm like, "thank God."
It's like, "dominatrix. Dominatrix.
Mixed with Hitchcock."
I'm like, "that's insane."
"Hitchcock meets marnie."
It actually spelled out the word "marnie."
"M-a-r-n-I-e." Like this. No!
I was like, "marnie."
It was like, "yes."
"M-I-c-k j-a-g-g..." oh, it's a big speller.
"Ouija"... you know how it goes over itself?
"Ouija likes... l-I-k-e-s...
B-o-y-s."
"Ouija likes boys."
I'm like, "ouija likes boys?"
"A-t n-I-g-h-t."
"Ouija likes boys at night."
Wow, what does that mean?
I said, "you mean Mick Jagger?"
It said, "yes."
Just a tuxedo or something.
It said, "flats for night. High heels, dominatrix shoes for day.
Flats for night." Insane.
How do you feel about this?
Scary. Very scary.
The collection is being designed with the ouija board.
Totally. What can I tell you?
It works.
I saved all this money...
And came to Paris
all by myself when I was 17.
It was, of course... the first time you experience jet lag...
Is a very crucial and important, you know, memory.
Anyway, there I was, jet lagged out of my mind, seventeen and landing in Paris with this big purple leather ensemble...
That I had constructed especially for the flight.
Terrified. It was the first time
I'd ever been away from home...
Without my parents or something.
You know, I wasn't sleeping.
I was waking up at 6:00 in the morning.
What was great was that all the pastry shops open really early, like at 4:00 in the morning, and I'd be walking on the streets buying pastries.
Actually, that's my favorite thing... another favorite thing about France.
I probably... the thing is, I say I hate traveling and being away from home, but I would love to live here for awhile or to have an apartment.
It would be so cool,
'cause it's the coolest place.
I mean, look at this.
Look at this.
It's terrible to work so hard
in a foreign place.
You have to keep doing these appointments and all you want to do...
Is blow your nose or get sinutab.
And there's no sinutab, you know?
Or feel comfortable and have people around you doing what they're supposed to be doing.
But you're all alone;
It's horrible.
I can never wait to leave, that's the thing.
I want to just get here, have a great cup of coffee...
And then get the hell out.

You read the cards? You'll tell us our fortune, our love lives?
Individually?
Individually, yes.
When you get to me, I'll tell you what I want to know.
They're good. They're good because they're seasoned.
I love them because they're well-worn.
There is a wallpaper in that bathroom that is so good.
Did you see the wallpaper?
That? Yeah.
So good. Wallpaper?
Darling, I would kill for a swatch of that wallpaper.
I'm sure Donna karan had, like, a polaroid camera when she went in there.
I went to the louvre today
to the costume archives.
They have this unbelievable fake fur from the 18th century.
It's amazing. Fake furs in the 18th century?
Made of silk. They're divine.
What's he saying?
I think he says this
to everyone.
But your whole energy is more... it's always inside of you.
- Reconnaissance.
- Reconnaissance?
Reconnaissance?
- Reconnaissance.
- To remember, no?
No. No, no.
To be recognized.
Yeah, to be known.
To have a comeback.
The comeback!
Always the comeback.
Always the comeback!
The comeback is major.

If you're "ger-na."
If you're "ger-na."
That's our imitation of this kind of wonderful illustration teacher...
That we all had at Parsons.
She used to say, "now, if you're ger-na draw with chalk, you're ger-na have to draw... you're ger-na."
"Yarn't" comes from Bette Davis, from that movie called who's afraid of...
 no. What ever happened to baby Jane?
You know that scene where Joan
Crawford is in the wheelchair...
And she says, "if I can only get out of this chair"... and she says, "yarn't ever gonna leave that chair, blanche, and yarn't ever gonna..." yarn't. Yarn't.
So we put it together.
Yarn't ever ger-na... you can make sentences. It's pretty insane.
People think it's insane.
You don't know what you're saying.
Blanche, yarn't ever gonna sell this house.
And yarn't ever gonna leave it...
Either.
Maybe just do these in suede and those in nubuck.
Suede, we're getting in black.
We're "ger-na" get in black.
Then this thing is probably wrong to have in here.
That's one, two, three, four.
- Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
- These are out, right?
Color, which is here, right?
- I was thinking, make this...
- That check... - a bustle.
These are the beast coats and almost the same jacket, minus that figure, right?
These are simple. They're gonna put them to work, and boom, they're done.
Look at it on.
If I had a short skirt, right?
Is it better shorter?
It's better shorter, isn't it?
Isn't it good? Women's wear isn't going to be happy; There's no color.
Then I redid... I know, exactly.
Who's doing the crossword puzzle?
I redid the, um... um...
"incur."
"Incur."
Um, five. "Iguana."
Iguana. Iguana.
Don't put it on your wall
until after April 12th.
2:45? You would have
till, like, 3:00.
So Elle magazine, five people
at 2:45.
Speaking of
astrakhan, there's this dress.
Oh, my God! That's great!
You love that?
Look how cute this little skirt is.
I can't wait for you to see that.
Pink satin, with, like, a tutu?
Where are they going to be?
- I've got something for the 7th.
- When are you shooting?
12th and 13th. Of, um, April?
You're not shooting on the 12th, honey, because my show is on the 12th.
You better be there.
There's always this moment of revelation when you kind of know...
That you're going to dare yourself to do something.
This time it happened.
I don't remember exactly when.
It was way before Christmas when I thought, oh, it has to be this kind of like, you know,
'50s cheesecake meets...
Like eskimo, kind of just crazy fake fur.
Very glamorous kind of a thing.
I was watching
call of the wild last year.
There's this scene in that movie where she is abandoned by her husband...
'Cause she's on the tundra, and he goes looking for food and eventually dies.
And Clark gable discovers her after, like, four days of being frostbitten and nearly dead.
Of course, when the close-up happens, the makeup is perfect, dewy skin, perfect eyebrows, lip liner;
The hair is, you know, perfection.
I'm thinking, if you must freeze on the tundra, this is the way to do it.
So I made a big note in my notebook,
"call of the wild."
Is he dead?
No, he isn't dead, and he isn't a he.
Maybe that could be...
maybe like right here...
Could be a little shorter.
Why do I like... because I'm
American, and I'm not a stone.
That's why I like
Mary Tyler Moore.
Um, basically, I think because between her and Jackie Kennedy, they shaped this country, that's why.
Between all of her portrayals... between
Laura petrie and Mary Richards, it's, you know, what shaped
Americans' whole taste level.

I am very happy where I am.
I am very happy in New York.
I don't need a lot of money. I don't need to move a thousand times.
I don't need to go to Australia or to India to do collections about those places.
I can do them
from my imagination,
or from having seen, you know,
the flintstones episode...
That was set in Australia
or something, you know.
That... that's what I love.
You know, that's what
I'm kind of about.
A lot of times she bought clothes that were cheater clothes, like cheap clothes, and turned them around.
Like high necklines in the front and low necklines in the back.
That's cause I wore it back to the front.
Like strange things.
Cut them at strange lengths, sew feathers on them.
Daisies... she had this pair of great shoes that were mules...
That all of the sudden had daisies on them, miraculously.
And who knew he was looking at them?
I mean, he was four years old. I was obsessed with them, okay?
He was four years old and he noticed the daisies on the mules?
You all right? Actually, we have a very big day tomorrow.
Naomi... like, all these girls.
Cindy Crawford, 9:45. Perfect.
And it's all day, right?
What are you doing for fall? I know you've always been a proponent of color.
Are you doing color now?
I'm doing a lot of color.
I'm sort of doing, like, uh, Giselle meets Fred flintstone or something.
It's all about fake furs, actually, for me.
These textures that are sort of beastly.
The texture of Isaac's fake furs...
Are so extraordinary.
Plus, weightless.
Pom-pom. Nothing. Powder puff.
You know what? Pins get stuck in here.
You better check for pins.
They get lost?
Yeah, they get lost. The thing is, all of the sudden you discover one.
And then Clark gable, like, discovers her nearly frostbite... Clark gable.
Clark gable... nearly frostbite, in a, like, skunk coat or something.
You know, fur to, like, here.
Then they have a close-up of her being discovered on the tundra.
Dewy makeup, eyebrows... she's supposed to be, like, you know... perfect lip liner. Everything is so perfect. Key light.
And she's, of course, dying of frostbite.
Which I love.
That's my favorite reference.
But...
Perfect makeup on the tundra.
Perfect hair.
Polly was freaking me out last night.
She was saying, "well, you know..." the whole scale of Isaac's show...
Changed my eye.
I had been saying,
"I don't know about short.
Not too short.
Too short looks wrong."
"But when you do too short,
it works."
And I'm thinking, "what does that mean?
Are all my skirts too short?"
What do they want, a longer short skirt?
Sorry, we did that last year.
Honey, what is this funky
tissue in your pocket?
I don't know, to tell the truth.
It's some scary... it's not scary. I don't have anything scary in my pockets.
Trust me.

No, here, in Michigan. Merv

Are you finally waking up?
Yeah, finally. God.
I'm finally waking up, yes.
You sounded very, very...
I took a valium last night. I could not go to sleep.
You seem a little bit, uh...
Well, I am. Agitated.
You know what it is? It's because my fittings start in a week from now.
I'm trying to focus everybody so we have as many things ready for the fittings as possible.
Half the stuff isn't ready.
I mean, the shoes are running really late, which is crazy.
The clothes... I'm just freaking out in general.
I can't take this. I definitely want the cashmere, but if it's not gonna be possible...
otherwise I can't stand it one more second, you know.
 No, I can't... I mean... it's, like, fucking gray flannel.
I'm not asking for, you know... it's gray flannel and corduroy.
Like I'm asking for, like, some kind of extinct animal skins, you know.
Where the hell is she? I can't deal with this anymore.
Just get her over here.
They sent this rib with it, and you put your finger right through it.
They were trying to put the lycra in it to make it more steady, but they tried three different trials and it didn't work.
Well, I don't understand it. It's yarn.
Can't they just knit a rib?
That knit on there is washed.
Then wash the sweaters.
They always say the same thing. These agencies are such fucking liars; I can't deal with them.
I can't deal with this either,
I have to tell you right now.
- I can't do all of this; I just can't.
- I know, I know.
Every single one of these appointments are ridiculous.
I don't know what they think I am made of, you know.
Where are those chips?
Everything is frustrating. Every single thing is frustrating.
Except designing clothes.
That's not frustrating.
That's really liberating and beautiful.
You know, being... frustrating is, I don't know, being overweight and not being able to lose weight... that's a problem.
Anything that you're really working hard at that's not working, that's a problem.
But frankly, designing clothes is never a problem.
I've always sort of been inspired by that character called...
Boris lermontov from the red shoes.
I've always wanted to be that character.
That incredibly precise,
handsome, trim, in control... he's totally in control.
He's very, sort of, severe.
He finishes with people and says, "good morning."
He doesn't say "thank you;" He says
"good morning," and they walk off.
- It's really dramatic.
- If you take my advice, it is worth remembering that it is much more disheartening...
To have to steal than to be stolen from.
Hmm?
Good morning.
There's this scene where he's having breakfast in the most beautiful room...
it's this gorgeous beige room.
I actually thought about that room a lot when I was decorating my apartment.
It's all kind of this dark kind of honey color and black accents.
The piano is black lacquer and he has a coromandel screen...
¶¶
That girl has a run-of-the-play contract.
- I know all about run-of-the-play contracts!
- Helen, this isn't gonna help... the only hit that comes out of a
Helen Lawson show is Helen Lawson, and that's me, baby, remember?
There's one star in a Helen Lawson production and that's Helen Lawson. Remember?
Me! One star... in a Helen
Lawson production...
And that's Helen Lawson.
And that's me, remember?
There's one star!
There's one star in a
Helen Lawson production, and that's Helen Lawson, and that's me! Remember?
The sculptures that Richard Sara makes that are, like, scary...
Can't look at that there.
Messes with my eyes.
I like it. That one's really cool, I think.
I love these pictures. This messes with my eyes, though.
Very chic pictures. To my eyes, it's like...
from a certain distance, when you look at it, it's controlling the picture.
You see?
- When are we getting engaged?
- Engaged? I am engaged.
Every time she has another ring at the fittings,
I say, "who are you engaged to this time?"
I've only been engaged once in my life.
Oh, right!
It's mark Morris. I see him.
Right there. Where?
Mark! Where is he?
He's over there.
Naomi Campbell, mark Morris.
Nice to meet you.
You are my heroine. Yes, of course you are.
How could you not be?
- She was a ballet dancer for a really long time.
- Me too.
Look, it's a dance step.
Do it again.
Here, I'll hum the music.
¶ Dee Dee Dee ¶
¶ ba da da Dee da da da da da da da da bom ¶
Yeah, exactly. It fits me, though, exactly.
Isn't it great? It's sort of rod Stewart on me.
It's very munster
It's very rod Stewart.
It's very good. It is good, but what if you had little tiny breasts?
No, it would be better, because your back is smaller if you're a girl.
- That's true.
- And your shoulders are smaller.
It's not balanced on you.
It's kind of simian, isn't it?
It's supposed to be.
Well, then, it worked. It's beastly, really, more than simian.
Every time she comes in
it's another engagement ring.
Let's see the engagement ring
this time, Naomi.
Then she'll wear it open like this.
So that's the jacket, right, annica?
Taking it out, opening the vents again, and then this, right?
Here, hold that, would you?
Oh, Naomi!
I won't have it. I'll take it out.
You promise?
Off. Good.
Make sure this doesn't show, okay?
You should take off all model's own jewelry. Oops.
Except for model's
own navel ring.
No, that's coming out. The ring doesn't come out.
The chain and the blue thing.
Mary! I can't! It closes up in an hour.
I have to get it redone. Twenty minutes you'll be on the runway.
As soon as air gets to it, it starts to... ew! Gross! I have to leave it in for nine months before it stays.
You don't understand.
When I take my engagement ring off, the newspapers say I'm not getting married.
So I get scandal.
- The boot is silly, isn't it?
- The high boot?
Hello. Hello. I don't like the boot.
The hush puppy boot?
It's not working. I'm in the middle of a fitting and can't talk.
Where are you? The high heel.
It's a poodle moment.
It's a poodle thing. It's a pink, sort of Parisian poodle thing.
Bye! Thank you! Bye, Ingrid!
Bye, everyone!
Did you? I had braids and I had the little curls here.
They even had a lot of bald men because it was punk and hasidic.
There was booing at the end.
I didn't hear anybody booing.
I certainly heard afterwards, "oh, my God!
Gautier's gone too far.
"Now he's done a thing about hasidic Jews.
"Jews are going to be upset and people are going to say, you know, this is a sacred thing."
I completely, completely disagree.
I think that what was so fantastic about it, and what is so fantastic about gautier, is that he incorporates politics and culture into his fashion.
I think to take something that none of us understand, necessarily, and mix it up and incorporate it into the culture...
And show all sorts of different people wearing it, is a way of removing strife.
I think that was really great.
I think that what one sees in
Isaac's collections, you know... in a way he sort of does the same thing.
He doesn't do it with that subject, but he picks on subjects that so many of us, that are part of life.
His last collection when he did the divorcée and the Hollywood thing...
I think to build content into fashion is where fashion's at.
Oh, please, no navel rings.
You don't have a navel ring, do you?
Do you have a navel bra... a navel bra!
Do you have a navel ring?
No. Please don't surprise me.
Do you want me to get one?
 No, I don't!
¶ It's working ¶ that's what Naomi would say.
¶ It's working ¶¶ aren't they handsome?
Very handsome.
She's going to work at hachette filipacchi.
She's going to work at Elle.
You know what I think?
This is very Isaac does Ralph Lauren.
Is it?
Thanks, Nina.
Now I won't sleep for the rest of the week.
I was just trying to make
a tiny little bit of fun!
Inuit. No, it's true. She's right. I didn't know that "eskimo" is a slur.
It's like a slur. It means
"fish eater" or something.
According to shalome.
"Eskimo" means "fish eater."
"Fish eater." Yeah.
It's fish hater.
Raw fish eater.
If there was a word for gefilte fish eater, that would be me, actually.
Gefilte fish eater.
This is honestly one of the worst weeks I've ever had in my whole life.
You should call me when you feel like that.
It'll make you feel better.
It was just so busy.
Monday I had a huge fight with Nina and Jennifer.
I actually ended up screaming at them in my office, which I've never done.
I've never done something like that.
It made you feel better.
It felt good, actually.
That's all.
Sometimes you have to clear the air, honey.
You want to me to tell you something?
Please.
I'm getting women's wear every day.
Everything you did I see them doing.
Me too. I swear to God!
I know. I see this guy coming out with Peter Pan collar...
And the ruffles coming out of the sleeves like you did.
Everything you do is copied left and right.
Me too. Left and right, without even a modification.
I don't know what... it's like I have no perspective on anything right now.
You haven't got an idea? No,
I have a million ideas.
Why don't you let me look at them, Isaac?
You're laughing? You're a riot.
Excuse me. I just think it's very funny.
That's not funny at all.
That's very funny. I have a very good eye, Isaac.
¶ I know ¶
¶ beyond a doubt ¶
¶ my heart will
lead me there soon ¶
¶ we'll meet

¶ bye-bye ¶¶ it's actually perfect on her.
You know, it was actually in
Paris, with katell at the louvre.
And we found all these racks.
It was like this empty space
with all these racks of muslin.
I picked up one of the muslins
and there was...
The most amazing corset.
It's impossible to believe.
It's metal inside.
It's metal, but goatskin also.
In between the linen, which is lining, and the iron.
Otherwise the iron would have pierced through there...
And would have-
gorged their gorgeous...
But it's such fabulous... to me it has to be our favorite Teddy bear.
Actually, it's... if you have enough hair.
It's to be like nanook of the north.
Oh, I see. Mm-hmm.
Sophisticated, soft and warm.
Saturn is rising above your horizon.
Now, on one level, you could have more than the normal aggravation with people...
That you deal with.
You could find people
who are even important to you...
In terms that you need
their cooperation in the work... you could find that they're not as cooperative as you would like them to be.
I'm doing this very new thing...
With, um, the way I'm showing, which is a platform and a scrim.
There are girls changing from behind the scrim...
So you can see through to where they're changing.
That could be a little bit of a problem.
Take all those flats out, right?
And you give me a scrim, just a scrim.
A white scrim.
And we have the name painted on... like in the theater?
You know, a scrim. Have you been to the ballet ever in your entire life?
It's like a painted backdrop, and you see right through it.
But this won't be painted. It'll just be white. Wait a minute.
You can do it also as a color.
So you're suggesting that...
I'm not suggesting it.
The models actually...
Are seen changing? Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Are they gonna want to do that?
I don't give a shit.
They're gonna have to do it.
 Here's the thing, yasmeen. Go.
They're gonna give you a bra and a panty because...
In the show, hopefully... well, if you don't want, you don't have to.
You have to cut that ribbon.
In the show, hopefully, there's like a scrim.
You can see through where the girls are changing. If you want.
You know, when you go to the ballet and you see a backdrop that you see through.
Okay, yeah, yeah. That's what it's gonna be, I hope.
They're gonna see us in bras and underwear?
Maybe. If you don't mind.
Some of the girls don't care.
Uh, I kinda care. You care?
All right. That's fine.
So she... she cares. I care.
She'll be in the back somewhere.
Robert, are you keeping a list of girls who don't want to do it?
Yeah. Of girls who care.
Naomi, I have to tell you about this thing in the show.
That is that some of the girls... maybe you, even... are going to be changing on stage where people can see you, sort of.
Uh-huh. But you'll be in your bra and panties the whole time.
What? No.
No.
Now, Cindy, here's the idea of the show.
If you say you don't like the idea, you're uncomfortable...
- be careful.
- You don't wanna put it...
Hello! This says hello to me very distinctly!
Isn't that amazing? It's fake?
It's fake. At last I have a sable coat!
Don't you think? It's so politically correct.
It's politically very correct. Oh, the '40s chubby is back! Thank God!
Why are you going so fast? Because
I want to show you the highlights.
Actually, that is very good. That little chiffon dress with the sweater.
Very good, no?
Not fussy, no? No, never fussy.
Fussy, finished.
Fussy, finished.
Too much jewelry, no.
Bad. Wrong.
Anjelica Houston last night, she had that beautiful dress...
And then these long earrings... no!
I have just been to a show. Be careful of makeup. Be careful.
"You just made fashion history." "You..." did she say that to you? My favorite thing was once she said to us,
"oh, it erases everything!"
I love that line.
This is so major.
Isn't that so good?
This is so major.
You get what I want? It's sort of, you know... it's not...
explain to me how glamorous
your life really is.
Start with, here it is, 8:30.
Um, here it is, 8:30. I still have makeup on from the last show.
I'm an hour behind schedule.
And I have a new husband at home waiting for me...
Kind of patiently.
Some other strange man under your skirt.
Isaac under my skirt.
Is this the height of fashion?
This is the peak.
This is mount Everest, darling.
Isaac's first show,
I was hysterically sobbing.
I had no idea he was so sophisticated.
He was a kid.
The color combinations and the fabrics...
Were so sophisticated for his age.
Very, very, very high.
And it was... I heard somebody say, one of the models... she said, "fashion history is made tonight."
We're still trying to get buttons, order decided on, um, stockings.
Our shoes... are, like, late.
Um, it... it's just a madhouse.
It's completely crazy.
I think... everything is designed...
And I think, like, somewhere he knows it's good, but then he starts to doubt himself.
We know it's good, but if he doesn't... if he starts to doubt himself, then there's just no way to convince him.
You just have to let him go through.
¶¶
I'll look into it. I don't know if these people can handle...
Creating this scrim.
Well... the other thing, Isaac... you know how much a scrim costs? Like 40 dollars.
It's so not expensive.
This scary union thing, we'll overcome it.
I'll stretch the fucking thing.
I'm just afraid of the press at this point.
Don't be so afraid.
I'm not afraid.
The minute you start getting afraid of the press is the minute that they're mean...
I had a conversation with twyla tharp.
It's like the most common material in the world.
That's twyla tharp.
They do this every day.
Why do we have to distract from the clothes?
They look so good.
Nina is snow white.
Actually, she looks
like snow white, doesn't she?
Just exactly like the cartoon of snow white and the seven dwarfs of Disney.
Um, but aside from that, she's just a really important... person...
Because she...
Feels everything as much as I do.
She goes through everything as much as I do.
She's as devoted as I am,
I think.
Nina is like a sister.
I always sort of viewed her
in that sisterly way.
It's a really great relationship that we have.
Meanwhile, just covering up this little nipple means that you're not nude?
How did you have that idea?
I just had it.
I had it a long time ago. To do it with the scrim or to do it with nothing?
I was gonna do it with nothing, then
I was at the ballet and thought,
"if Nina's too nervous without anything, we'll just have a scrim."
You show me the pose, and I'll do it.
All right. Do this.
Last night I went to the
Knicks game and they won.
Have you ever been to the garden for a game and sit in the front row?
No. It's so cool.
I'll go! These guys are like gods because they're so tall.
Hugely tall. Beautiful bodies, like sculpture.
It's so funny that I know this whole different world which is fun.
It's fun to not only know fashion people.
Once I went to a baseball game at shea stadium...
And it was out of this world.
At night... it's all lit for day so it's all this halogen light.
Everything becomes kind of surreal.
The grass is really sort of like lime green.
It's so fabulous.
And the skin is orange.
I was screaming. I was so into it.
I was so excited.
At some point somebody in the back screamed out, "sit down, Nelly!"
It was so embarrassing.
Everybody started to roar.
This is what I meant when I said these are cheesy fake... fake shooting is cheesy.
Absolutely.
I just had this big fight. "I'm not trying to be a bitch, but really, you cannot fake a shoot; It's cheesy." You're absolutely right.
Thank you very much.
It's paper dolls.
We're like on... Models, inc.
 On models, inc.
Beautiful.
You're a little close. It's like, hello, my pores are not that small.
Exactly.
Your pores are very small.
¶ Don't need to waste it ¶¶
ooh, that was flat.
I can't decide if it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever done in my life...
To be away from my studio.
But you know what? It's not about me.
It's about the sewers now.
I've done my work.
¶ Do-do-do do-do-do-do ¶
¶ Do-do do-do-do you're gonna make it after all ¶
¶ da-da dun-dun dun-dun-dun dun ¶¶
You better bring it in to him.
He's gonna seem like an idiot
if he doesn't know.
We're not going to design fake furs because gautier is doing it? That's crazy.
Do you believe this?
"Nanook of the north."
Isaac's gonna flip. How could another designer have the exact same idea?
And they show before we do.
What? Look at this.
Oh, my God!
Do you believe this? No.
Oh, my God!
Doesn't look anything like... oh, my God!
Take it away! Take it away!
Oh, take it away! This happens every season with people.
It doesn't mean that we can't do this.
We're obviously doing it. That's why... don't show these things to me.
I've not been looking at it.
Just don't show it to me.
You showed it to me. It's like you took some evil pleasure in it.
No, I didn't, Isaac!
We're gonna talk
to women's wear tomorrow.
Right now I feel very trapped, in a way, like there's no way to change anything...
Or rethink anything.
It's all done.
A scrim. I scrim, you scrim.
We all scrim for the scrim.
To scrim or not to scrim.
That is the question.
The scrim, yeah. I'm totally ready.
Who really cares, anyways?
I mean... yeah, I'm sure they care, but anyways, who cares?
Yep. Yep, really.
It's very good, isn't it?
With the pin and everything.
This is my mother's hat, actually.
"Lucilla Mendez, exclusively New York."
I love it.
I think it's so good.
How come you're so stressed out
right now?
Um, I'm not really that stressed out.
I hate it when people tell me I'm stressed out, more than anything.
I'm not that stressed out.
I'm fine.
That was an endless fitting
today, am I wrong?
It was just...
I was losing my mind.
Putting the scrim together,
way more overtime than normal.
We always have overtime.
Um, I don't know. I just feel really vulnerable.
I feel really set up or something, as I do before most collections, you know.
And it's a mood swing.
I have a feeling it has more to do with what I ate for lunch...
Than anything else, but... and you can't help it.
You can't help feeling moody.
You know?
You just can't help it.
Um,
I like to feel in control, and, you know, on the last couple of days,
I don't ever feel like
I'm in control.
I feel like, um, out of control, so, um...
I just can't wait for the show, really.
That's it.
I just can't wait for it.
It has to be the most wonderful
20 minutes of a designer's life.
You know?
You look forward to it...
So much.
How fabulous this is gonna be, you know?
You're just gonna see right through.
Amazing, you know?
¶¶
Then you have to change from that into this really quickly, so...
no, you can turn your back
or go in the corner.
There's also gonna be a dresser, so... we don't have the lights on, though.
Guys?
You can see everything!
No, you see everything!
I told you!
Can you see what I'm wearing?
You can see everything!
I know! I told you!
It's my natural exhibitionism...
That comes out of this situation.
You really do see everything. Oh, yes.
So, how are we going from here to there?
You can see everything!
It's like you're the... you're out there.
- It's so crazy to dress nude next to Naomi and Carla.
-  Oh, shut up!
I must be out of my fucking mind to dress next to the two best bodies in the business!
Ouch! Oww!
Oww! Oww!
Aaah! You hurt my hand!
You have taken him!
We just got here!
Let me get roseanne!
My God!
Give me just a little, all right?
All right, just a tad.
Being rude to me isn't going to help.
So, are you on the list?
 Joyce. Yes.
- Okay, so what's your last name?
- Clifford.
Clifford? Yes. Certainly.
I don't have it on the list.
What?
I'm not trying to be rude, but if I don't have you on the list I can't let you in.
I don't think you have to try.
Pardon? You don't have to try.
Are women's wear here yet?
How about the retailers?
Women's wear? Are they here... women's wear is here.
Ten minutes, the show is gonna start?
Yes. Five minutes.
Five minutes. That's good.
We're right about to start.
Go get your seat. Yes, okay.
Girls, you're in your first look?
They're gonna see me naked backstage?
 You look heavenly.
Sexy.
Well, a little bit. It's like... "playboy" Mizrahi.
Isaac, why do you always give me the flat shoes and you always give Naomi Campbell high heels?
You gave me slippers for my finale last season!
She wouldn't take them!
Every single time! Oh, shut up!
Do you have something against white women?
Because you have to speak up, lovey!
I did, for my finale; I said, you ain't givin' me slippers... I had slippers last time!
I've got the same problem.
Heels, heels, heels!
All right, where we goin'?
What do we do...
Let's just get it started.
Go music!
I'm serious. Go music.
Let's go! Let's go!
Just get lost!
Go! ¶¶
It's getting sheer, girls.
¶¶
¶¶ they can see us now, right?
¶¶ girls!
¶¶ we're starting now!
¶¶ Where is Linda?
Has anybody...
¶ Oh, you make me feel ¶

¶¶ Really? What do I do?
You don't care!

¶¶ You don't care!
I totally care!
¶¶ Go out, go out, go out, go out, go out! All right!
¶¶ they can see everything through that fucking screen!
¶¶ everything!
¶¶ I'm naked in public!
¶¶ Just drop it down at the end of the runway, right? At the what?
¶ My darlin', you know

Genius! ¶ Mighty real ¶

¶ mighty real ¶
-  ¶ my darlin', you know you make me feel ¶
- Ooh!
¶ Mighty real ¶
Take it off, Cindy!
¶¶ help me. Help me.
¶¶ - Out! Out! Clear out!
Wait a minute!
¶¶ Major lint!
¶¶ Get the major lints off!
Isaac don't like major lint.
¶¶ Sweetie, that thing is in my fucking face...
¶¶ all the time, sweetie!
¶¶ Isaac, call them and get a coat!
¶¶ oww!
¶¶ Paul, you pervert!
You pervert!
¶¶ go!
¶¶ Together? Together, but don't walk together; Walk stag!
¶¶ The three of you go out, and then you...
¶¶
¶ Who can turn the world on
with her smile ¶
¶ who can take a nothing day ¶
¶ and suddenly make it all
seem worthwhile ¶
¶ well, it's you, girl
and you should know it ¶

¶¶ ¶ I'll take you and you'll never be sure ¶

Although they don't listen to me, and they buck my authority,
I still think
I rule it pretty well.

I went to a ball.
I got a trophy.
And now everybody
wants to know me.
This movie is about
the ball circuit
and the gay people
that's involved in it and how each person's life brought them to this circuit.
It's like crossing into the looking glass in wonderland.
You go in there, and you feel... you feel 100% right... as... of being gay.
And that's not what it's like in the world.
That's not what it's like in the world.
That's not what it's like in the world.
You know, it should be like that in the world.
This society, going to a football game, basketball... that's their entertainment.
You know, a ball is ours.
We prepare for a ball.
We may spend more time preparing for a ball than anybody would spend preparing for anything else.
You know, a ball is like our world.
The balls, to us, is as close to reality as we're gonna get to all of that fame and fortune and stardom and spotlights.
Man: I'd always see the way
that rich people lived.
And I'd feel it more,
you know... it would slap me in the face.
I'd say,
"I'd have to have that."
Because I never felt
comfortable being poor.
Or even middle class
doesn't suit me.
Seeing the riches,
seeing the way people
on "dynasty" lived...
And I would think,
"these people have 42 rooms
in their house.
Oh, my God.
What kind of a house is that?"
And we've got three.
So why is it that
they can have it and I didn't?
I always felt cheated
out of things like that.

So give the patrons
and the contestants, you know,
a round of applause for nerve.
'Cause with y'all vicious mother[Bleep], it do take nerve.
Believe me.
We're not going to be shady,
just fierce.
Those balls are more or less like our fantasy of being a superstar.
You know, like the oscars or whatever.
Or being on a runway as a model.
You know, a lot of those kids that are in the balls, they don't have two of nothing.
Some of them don't even eat.
They come to balls starving.
And they sleep
in the under-21,
or they sleep on the pier
or wherever.
They don't have
a home to go to.
But they'll go out, and they'll steal something and get dressed up and come to a ball for that one night and live the fantasy.

You know, it's them cheering and screaming if you were good.
And that's what got me,
'cause I like the competition.
Makes me stronger.
It makes me think more.
Makes me want to come back and get them.
It's not just the winning.
It's... it's the giving, too.
'Cause I feel that I give a lot of enjoyment to a lot of people that go to balls.
And they enjoy to see it, and I enjoy to walk for them.

But I'm really...
I'm one of top, upcoming children... legendary.
You have legendary children
and upcoming legendary children.
Right.
We're the upcoming ones.
We've been out longer
than the ones
that are here now.
And we done had our... we have our status in the ballroom.
How long did it take you to do the tank top?

It's... you know, it's a good high.
It's an addictive high, like all highs... in the long run... turn out to be.
But it's a high that won't hurt you.
If everybody went to balls and did less drugs, it'd be a fun world, wouldn't it?
I'm dressing, of course, to go do a show.
Because I've always done this professionally.
And I was a dancer.
And I'm trying to remember when the first time I went to a ball.
That was the early-type ball, when everybody just walked,
and they gave away,
like, four or five prizes
in a very limited category.
And the children now... most of them...
75% of the children you see at the ball wouldn't know what a ball was if it knocked them in the head.
Labeija: When I first started
going to balls, it was all about drag queens, and they were interested in looking like
Las Vegas show girls... backpieces, tailpieces, feathers, beads, and all that.
But as the '70s rolled around, the thing started changing.
It started coming down to just wanting to look like a gorgeous movie star, like Marilyn Monroe,
Elizabeth Taylor.
And now they've went from that to trying to look like models like Iman and Christie Brinkley and maud Adams and all those children.
Corey: Everyone couldn't be a Las Vegas show girl.
Everyone couldn't put on
a stack of feathers
and a big headpiece.
So they made the categories
where everybody...
that's what really made
the balls change.
So there was more involvement.
Everyone that goes to one of
these affairs now
damn near participates.
Eventually, over the course
of a year's balls, they've all walked the runway in some category or another.
Either you've got a nice body or you are very fashionable
or you're very pretty or you're very real-looking.
But there's always something
there for everyone.
And it's like...
it's like in nature...

stay awake for.

Corey: In real life, you can't
get a job as an executive
unless you have
the educational background
and the opportunity.
Now, the fact that you are not an executive is merely because of the social standing of life.
That is just pure thing.
Black people have a hard time getting anywhere.
And those that do are usually straight.
In a ballroom, you can be
anything you want.
but you're looking like
an executive.
And therefore you're showing the straight world that
"I can be an executive.
"If I had the opportunity,
I could be one, because I can look like one."
And that is like a fulfillment.

I had trophies, but I was telling her
I won them for basketball.
And I had won trophies

with my girlfriends.
I had on white hot pants,
a chiffon blouse, a pony tail.
And my father was waiting for the light in his car.
And he saw me.
He recognized me.
And he went straight to my house before I could get there and told my mother,
"your son is a woman."
She didn't press it then.
But, like, maybe a few months later when she noticed that I had breasts, everything started coming together.
She really was devastated.
"How could you have breasts bigger than mine?
"You're growing nails.
"You're becoming a woman right before my very eyes.
"I can't hold my head up.
And she still loved me, but the nagging and the... oh, my God, about this women's clothes.
And when I had women's clothes stashed in my closet and she found them, she would destroy them.
She burnt up a mink coat.
I was, oh... Devastated.
She smelled the perfume in it that I liked to wear... which was jungle gardenia
at the time... and she said, "this ain't no girl's coat.
This is your coat."
Took it downstairs in the backyard of the building and burned it.
And I stood there and cried like a baby.

when they can walk
out of that ballroom
into the sunlight
and onto the subway and get home and still have
all their clothes

to make myself complete.

and I used to do it
behind my family's back...
till finally
they caught on with it.
And I didn't want to
embarrass them, so that's when I moved away.
I moved to New York,
and I continued doing it.
When someone has rejection from their mother and father, their family, they... when they get out in the world, they search.
They search for someone to fill that void.
I know this for experience, because I've had kids come to me and latch hold to me like I'm their mother or like I'm their father.
'Cause they can talk to me, and I'm gay, and they're gay.
And that's where a lot of that "ballness" and... and the mother business comes in.
Because their real parents give them such a hard way to go, they look up to me to fill that void.

A house?
Let's see if we can
put it down sharply.
They're families.
You can say that.
For a lot of children
who don't have families.
But this is a new meaning
of "family."
The hippies had families,
and no one thought
nothing about it.
It wasn't a question of
a man and a woman and children,
which we grew up knowing
as a family.
It's a question of a group of
human beings in a mutual bond.

A house is a gay street gang.
Now, where street gangs
get their rewards
from street fights, a gay house street-fights
at a ball.
And you street-fight at a ball
by walking in the categories.
The houses started
because you wanted a name.
The people that the houses
are named after
were ball walkers
who became known for winning.
Emcee:
Work... Paris... Dupree.
Corey: After the first
few houses were started
and named after people
who had won trophies,
they also would create houses.
Like, a new group of kids would just create a house, then they'd work at building its name up, which worked... the house of Xtravaganza, the house of Saint Laurent.
Overness.
Pendavis.
Adonis.

Dupree.
They saw me, and they all liked me... all the rest of the Xtravaganzas... and they decided, "well, if you want to become an Xtravaganza",
"you have to walk a ball for us.
"And if you snatch a trophy, then you can become the Xtravaganza."
That's how it's supposed to work with any... everyone.
But, uh...
Like, that wasn't with me.
I just became an Xtravaganza.
He's the one who started
the house.
He was the first gay man
I ever met.
The first time he took me to the village... which was my birthday...
I had just turned 15 years old.
And he threw a party for me out there.
He bought me a cake.
I met a lot of drag queens,
transvestites, that I didn't believe were because they were so beautiful.
And that kind of
sunk into my head.
And I guess that's why it kind of made me want to even do it more.
They treat each other like sisters, mm-hmm.
Sisters...
Or brothers...
Or mothers or...

"oh, that's my sister," because she's gay, too, and I'm gay,
and she's a drag queen

We're always... if we're not together, we always speak on the phone.
My name is Angie Xtravaganza, and I am the mother of the house of Xtravaganza.
When there's a ball,
I'm always doing something for everybody in my house.
I do that one's hair, the other one's makeup.

I always offer advice.
You know, I mean, as far as what I know and what I've been through in gay life.

I'm sorry.
I don't see that house.
Only reason I see my house... pendavis... is because Kim and avis.
'Cause both of them walked.
And at the last ball, avis showed her goddamn ass off!
They call them competitions.
But believe me, they're wars.
And they often do lead to fights.
The emotions be very high.
They're very intense, very intense affairs.
But I guess that's what makes them fun.
Like a good movie... if there's no emotion...
You don't enjoy it.
I don't talk too much about the ball kids because I want them to talk about me.
Because I haven't walked yet.
And it's like, well, William says,
"I want you to walk in my ball.
I want you to walk in my ball."
And I keep telling William,
I say, "I'll walk when I walk."
"I'll walk when I want, not when you want.
I'll walk when I want."
And so far, I don't know when I'm gonna walk.
I'm thinking somewhat around the time of the legends ball.
But don't quote me on that.
I mean, it really
causes hate, actually, between two individuals.
It's like a war on the floor.
Like world war III.
[ Laughs ]
But the only thing about it... they're gay.
Emcee: Now... cut the music...
now, I said...
I said, "men's garments"!
Corey: He looked like he had on a man's fox coat.
Tell this child, where are the men's garments?
Man: I paid for it,
mother[Bleep]!
A man bought it!
It buttons on the right side!
The judges... it buttons on the right side!
Corey: Someone came up and told the emcee...
Are you a judge?!
That it was a woman's coat.
I thought it was kind of silly to nitpick.
Ooh, that's shady!
They're throwing shade at him.
I can't believe it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, now.
Let's not get loud.
Now, David.
David. David.
That's the one thing that
I find faulty with the balls.
After they've laid down these little categories,
then they try to
become a stickler for exact interpretation... merely a point to discredit the contestant.
Like in an Olympics where the Russian judge brought to the fact that the American coach had stepped onto the floor, and that was a disqualification for the contestant... just as picky as a ball.
So those little flaws like that... that's because that's a part of shade.
That's the idea... knock them out if you can.
Get them any way you... hit them below the belt.
It was typed out!
The second... where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Stop! No ball.
Shade comes from reading.
Reading came first.
Reading is the real art form of insult.
Now, you want to talk about reading?
Let's talk about reading.
What is wrong with you, Pedro?
Are you going through it?
You're going through some kind of psychological change in your life?
She went back to be a man.
Oh, you went back to being a man.
Touch this skin, darling.
Touch this skin, honey.
Touch all of this skin.
Okay?
You just can't take it.
You're just an overgrown orangutan.
You get in a smart crack, and everyone laughs and kee-kees because you found a flaw and exaggerated it... then you've got a good read going.
I am a person just like you.
You cut me,
I bleed the same way you do.
I bleed the same color.
If it's happening between
the gay world
and the straight world,
It's more of an insult,
a vicious slur-fight.
See, see? There go my sister right there.
She don't even want to even admit that she my sister.
She a bulldagger.
[ Laughter ]
But it's how they develop
a sense of how to read.
That's my husband right there.
And that's my girlfriend right there.
They may call you a faggot
or a drag queen.
You find something
to call them.
But then when you are
all of the same thing, then you have to go to the fine point.
In other words, if I'm a black queen and you're a black queen, we can't call each other black queens
'cause we're both black queens.
That's not a read.
That's just a fact.
So then we talk about your ridiculous shape.
Your fa... saggy face.
Your tacky clothes.
Let me see what you are... spreading lies!
Let's see. Oh!
No paint!
Yes, it's paint!
It's paint!
No mother[Bleep] paint, girl!
What? She wears more makeup than my mother did!
Then reading became a developed form where it became shade.
Shade is
"I don't tell you you're ugly, but I don't have to tell you because you know you're ugly."
And that's shade.

Emcee:
Pump... Dip... Spin... Vogue.
Dip.
Go... Turn... It... Out.
Ninja:
Voguing came from shade because it was a dance that two people did because they didn't like each other.
Instead of fighting, you would dance it out on the dance floor.
And whoever did the better moves was throwing the best shade, basically.
Emcee:
No touching.
Neither one of you.
If you touch, I'm chopping you.
I'm telling you right now.
Ninja: You could take the
pantomime form of the vogue... this is what, generally, sometimes I do is I make my hand into a form like a compact or a makeup kit.
And I'm, like, beating my face with blush, shadows, or whatever, to the music.
Then, usually, I'll turn the compact around to face that person... meaning, like, almost like my hand is a mirror... for them to get a look.
Then I'll start doing their face,
because what they have
on their face right now needs a dramatic makeup job.
So voguing's like a safe form of throwing shade.

It's starting to make
a name for itself,
but I want it
to be known worldwide,
and I want to be on top

I want to take voguing not
to just Paris is burning, but I want to take it to the real Paris and make the real Paris burn.
That's what I want to do,
and not just there,
but to other countries as well.
My house name is Ninja, and I would really like to take my whole house and go to Japan...
And really let loose and do it and have them accept it there.
I want to be a big star.
Uh, known, generally, every corner of the world.
You know, maybe as a choreographer, a famous dancer, a singer, or all of them.
What the balls
has to do with that, as far as the dance field, is maybe perfecting my craft
a little better,
to learn new things, new ideas, and bring them to the real world.
It's been really unbelievable, my life.
If I was to die today or tomorrow,
I could not say I've not had an exciting life.
I have had a fabu... and I'm not rich, mind you.
Just imagine if I had the dollars.
Ooh, it'd be too much

If I had the riches
and I had the fame, trust me, all of y'all in here would be rich...
'Cause I'm very generous.
You know, I can't...
I wouldn't enjoy having a whole lot of money, like being a millionaire and hoarding it, you know?
I'd share it with all my loved ones.

[ Laughter ]
You own everything.
Everything is yours.
This is white America.
Any other nationality
that is not of the white set knows this and accepts this till the day they die.
That is everybody's dream and ambition as a minority...
to live and look
as well as a white person.
It is pictured as being
in America.
Every media you have,
from TV to magazines
to movies to films...
I mean, the biggest thing that
minority watches is what?
"Dynasty" and "the Colbys."
Um, "all my children,"
the soap operas.
Everybody have
a million-dollar bracket.

everybody's in their own home.

They're riding around the lawn.

This is white America.
And when it comes
to the minorities,

We, as a people
for the past 400 years,
is the greatest example
of behavior modification
in the history of civilization.
We have had everything
taken away from us,
and yet we have
all learned how to survive.
That is why,
in the ballroom circuit,
it is so obvious that if you have captured the
great white way of living...
Or looking...
Or dressing or speaking...
You is a marvel.
I think if I could just be on TV or film or anything,
I'd do that instead of the money.
Of course, I do want the money because I want the luxury that goes with it.
But...
I want to be wealthy.
If not wealthy, content, comfortable...

I want to be somebody.

I just want to be a rich somebody. [ Laughs ]

If that could be me,

I can compare to Paulina, to stand next to her and to take pictures with her.
And I look at her here, and I'd say she's seductive, and she's alluring.
I look at her there, and I say she's sexy and provocative.

Well, it depends.

The thing that helped me make my most money through the escort service is being that I'm so little.
I'm so petite and tiny.
Um... The blond hair and the light skin and the green eyes and the little features.
And the client's hands will be bigger than my hands while they would hold my hand or something.
You know, they like feeling that they're with something perfect and little, and not someone that's bigger than them, because I guess that kind of disturbs them.
Most all the drag queens that are involved in the balls,
they... 90% of them...
are hustlers.
I guess that's how
they make their money
to go to the balls
and get whatever they need.
I used to hustle in New York
to make my money.
I was with a guy, and he was playing with my titties
till he touched me down there.

he, like, totally flipped out.

You're a freak."
"You're a victim of aids, and
you're trying to give me aids.
You're a homo.

out the window.

and just jumped out the window.

to hustle anymore.
I don't, and I'm afraid
of what's going on...
the aids...
and I don't want to catch it.

He's a young, very good, attractive, handsome young man.
And, um, he's taking me out to dinner later on this evening,
or for cocktails
after midnight.
I know he'll give me some money...
Just for me to maybe buy a pair of shoes and a nice dress so that the next time he sees me...
He'll see me looking more and more beautiful... the way he wants to see me.
But I don't have to go to bed with him
or anything like that.
At times,
they do expect sexual favors, but that is between myself
and them, so I do not wish to further speak about that...
If they do.
But at most times,
99% of the time, they don't.
95% of the time, they don't.
But I feel like...
If you're married... a woman in the suburbs, a regular woman...
Is married to her husband, and she wants him to buy her a washer and dryer set...
In order for him to buy that,
I'm sure she'd have to go to bed with him anyway to give him what he wants for her to get what she wants.
So, in the long run, it all ends up the same way.
If money wasn't so important in the world today...

I can only say how a man
who acts like a woman
or dresses like a woman feels.
I never wanted to have a sex change.
That's just taking it a little too far, you know?
Because if you decide later on
in life to change your mind,
you can't...
once it's gone, it's gone.
A lot of kids that I know, they got the sex change because they felt,
"oh, I've been treated so bad as a drag queen.
"If I get a [Bleep]"... excuse the expression...
"I'll be treated fabulous."
But women get treated bad.
You know, they get beat, they get robbed, they get dogged.
So having the vagina, that doesn't mean that you're gonna have a fabulous life.
It might, in fact, be worse, you know.
So I've never recommended it, and I myself would have never, ever got it, and I'm so thankful that I was that smart, because right about now, this next 40 or so years that I'm gonna be here,
I'm gonna live.

<I>I, uh, introduced rap music</I> along with dancing...
To Japanese people, and they really loved it.
Woman: This, ladies and gentlemen, is voguing,
a form of dance
that has its roots in Harlem... a takeoff on runway modeling,
which they had plenty of
last night as well.
Voguing is an attitude,
a style.
It's... It's...
A kind of an institutionalized showing off.
But not without its entertainment value.
Something very spectacular, very important... Art form.
Very important.
It's just so theatrical, and the energy... oh, it's just terrific.
Woman: In addition to perhaps putting voguing in vogue,
this love ball sponsored by the design industries foundation for aids raised more than $350,000
for research and housing for the homeless
who have aids.
And I have never seen anything
quite like it.

perform on my own.
But now, my foot is, like, in every little doorstep that you can think of.
Um...
I'm doing a lot of runway work, um, dancing... performing for Malcolm Mclaren,
various other people,
doing choreography,

put their shows together.

She always went

She always did what she wanted

I had a booking for a Christmas show at Sally's, and the D.T.S came to me with a picture of her murdered, and they were about to cremate her
'cause nobody had came to verify the body, and I was the one that had to give all this information down to her family.
Actually, they found her dead
after 4 days,
strangled under a bed in a
sleazy hotel in New York City.
I'm hungry.
and, you know, she was like my right hand, as far as I'm concerned.
I miss her. Every time
I go anywhere, I miss her.
That was my main... the main daughter of my house, in other words.
But that's part of life, as far as being a transsexual in New York City and surviving.
I always had hopes of being a big star.
And then I looked... as you get older, you aim a little lower.
And I just say, "well, yeah, you still might make an impression."
Everybody wants to leave something behind them... some impression, some mark upon the world.
Then you think...
You've left a mark on the world...
If you just get through it...
And a few people remember your name.

But I remember feeling absolutely electrified.

I loved the idea that there'd be
All these great places for people to go dancing,
After the terrible social wasteland
Of our college years. Uhff.
You've been to a lot of discos?
No. In fact, practically none.
For me, law school wasn't easy,
And I haven't had much of a social life
Since coming to the city, either.
But I still consider myself a loyal adherent
To the disco movement.
It's a "movement"?
Sort of.
What I found terribly encouraging
Was the idea that when the time in life came
To have a social life,
There'd be all these great places
For people to go to,
Because, as you'll remember,
For many years, there were none.
Yeah.

"the author's brother is,
"According to Tibetan Buddhism,
"God.
Recommend..."
"Very kind decline."
Anything interesting?
Not really.
What time did you get back?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I didn't check.
Well, was it light or dark?
Why do you care what time I got in?
Sorry. No reason.
We've got to get an apartment of our own.
Do you know how long it takes
To become an editor?
You mean associate editor.
Yeah. Associate editor.
What's the minimum amount of time
To become an associate editor?
How many years?
That's hard to say.
Approximately.
Maybe 4 years.
But more than years,
Before you can become an associate editor,
You have to have a best seller.
How can you be sure you'll get a best seller?
You cannot.
But what if you don't find one?
You have to.
Show them the outline.
You might want to see this.
It's the Scott Meredith best seller outline.
"Create sympathetic characters,
"With whom readers identify.
Give them problems, make these problems big."
Could I photocopy this?
Yes, but I need it back.
I'd like a copy, too.
That stuff is such crap.
This does describe a lot of best sellers.
That's true.
It's completely formulaic.
Of course it's formulaic. It's a formula.
That's why I prefer nonfiction.
It's good you want to be an editor so much.
In this era of television,
You are devoted to the printed word.
Actually, ultimately,
I'd like to work in television.
But right now, what I need's a raise.
Alice and I have been looking at apartments,
But we can't afford one on what we get as assistants.
That's so comical.
What?
That giris like you really worry about paying rent.
Aren't your fathers heavily subsidizing
Your living expenses with big allowances?
They're not big at all.
In a few years, you'll marry
Some incredibly rich corporate lawyers.
It's not as if you really worry about paying the rent
Like the rest of us.
Oh, you worry about paying the rent?
Yeah.
Then you're way ahead of us
'Cause we don't even have an apartment.
What if, in a few years,
We don't marry some corporate lawyer?
What if we marry some meatball like you?
But not you personally,
But someone with similarly low socioeconomic prospects?
Can you believe that?
They really think that way.
Disco sucks.
What a dope.
Would you ever go out
With anyone who worked in the company?
Fortunately,
There's absolutely no temptation.
Charlotte, telephone.
It's a man.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
We were thinking of having some people for dinner
Saturday night.
Wanted to know if you could come.
About 7:30.
Ok. Where?
Actually, I'll have to call you back with that.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Ok.
Bye.
That was Jimmy Steinway.
He's coming for dinner Saturday night.
You called him?
I thought you said you could never be interested
In anyone who worked in advertising.
No one could say something like that seriously.
It was obviously a joke.
Anyway, it's not like it's a date or anything.
He's invited as part of a group.
It's really important
There be more group social life,
Not just all this ferocious pairing off.
You like Tom.
Invite him.
We don't even have an apartment.
How can we have a dinner party?
Well, it's another incentive to get one.
Does the Lexington avenue express stop at 86th street?
I think so.
We'd better hurry.
Do you really think we know each other well enough
To room together?
Well, maybe that's good.
It's not just that we don't know each other well.
I'm not even sure we really like each other.
That's ok.
You know, Alice,
I'm not so much of a bitch as I might seem.
You'll find holly's a little sensitive
About her intelligence.
She's dumb?
Harvard guys, even the ones that
Seem reasonably cool on the outside,
Are all essentially wimps and bookworms
On the inside.
They love being seen out with this lovely girl,
But after a date or two,
Rather than risk rejection,
They pretend to drop her,
Going around complaining about how dull she was.
Is she dull?
A little, but that's not the point.
Once you start worrying about something like that,
You're lost.
Holly was devastated.
She stopped dating entirely,
And weekends either went home
Or just hung around the library at pine manor.
What do you think you're doing?
Shove off, Mack!
Deviant!
Creep! Off!
So I wouldn't develop any illusions
About Harvard guys.
They can be amazing creeps, too.
Ah, there you are.
Hi.
Our friend still isn't here.
Sorry. I forgot which way the numbers went
On the east side.
It's what's called a railroad apartment.
It's long and rather narrow like a railroad car.
Each room opens directly onto the other.
It's very nice.
The closets are here.
This is the other bedroom.
The bathroom is back here at this end.
And the kitchen.
So to get to the bathroom from the living room,
You have to clomp through both bedrooms?
Well, there are 2 outside doors,
So in theory,
You can use the exterior hall
To go between the kitchen and the living room.
Huh.
Even with 2 roommates, the layout is a bit awkward.
You can't afford something bigger?
We all work in book publishing.
Couldn't your parents help?
They already are.
So what do you think?
I think it's really nice.
Isn't the layout a bit awkward?
Well, I think we should take it.
Here you go.
It's good to see bourgeois giris
Building up a sweat.
Why is that good to see?
You live around here?
There was a guild meeting at asphalt green.
A guild meeting?
The newspaper guild is organizing clerical
And editorial staff for book publishing.
I'm supposed to organize our department.
Oh, my god. We're all gonna lose our jobs.
You should support this.
You were just complaining how lousy the pay is.
Are you rooming with them?
That's gonna be really tough.
Aren't we behind schedule?
Nope. This recipe's extremely fast.
Hello.
Uh, it's Dan.
Dan?
Hi. Come up.
Dan from your department.
I invited him.
Departmental Dan?
You know... he went to Harvard.
So?
Yeah, I've got to meet some clients at 10:00
And get them into the club.
Tom isn't coming?
If he does, he'll be very late.
Isn't this what they call a railroad apartment?
Uh-Huh.
People always say how terrible they are,
But it seems pretty nice.
Well, the layout's not so good.
It's amazing the little things in life
One doesn't appreciate until they're missing,
Such as hallways.
These apartments were actually planned
In the last century as tenement housing
For working class families.
Now all the yuppie roommate combos
Are crowding them out.
Well... that's just tough.
Fight!
Rumble!
Actually, I was thinking I'd go home.
What?
You should come.
I don't know.
I'm not really a disco type.
Well, who is?
I probably wouldn't get in anyway.
Of course you'll get in. Holly's gorgeous.

Thanks, Jimmy.
Have fun, jack, harry.
Thanks a lot, des. I really appreciate it.
Fine, cool.
I'm starting to realize how important eye contact is.
I can't talk to people in this thing.
They get nervous. They don't know who I am.
Well, that's the point.
You think tonight would be a good time
To talk to van?
Try to patch things up, get a reprieve of some sort?
Uh, no.
My job's sort of on the line, des.
And not all clients will be such good sports
As harry and jack.
If it's a question of groveling,
I can do that.
Just point me in the right direction.
Shh! God!
Can I show you something?
Sure. What?
You know something about banking, don't you?
Yeah. Manny hanny used to be a client.
Manufacturers hanover.
I know what manny hanny is.
Note... no lock.
10 is the cover charge.
God. Paying a cover charge to get into a club?
How humiliating.
That's your reaction?
Look at this.
Kind of worrisome, don't you think?
Yeah.
To me, shipping cash to Switzerland
In canvas bags
Doesn't sound honest.
To me, it suggests possible illegality.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Well, I'm not going into that room anymore.
Uh, gimlet, please?
Domestic beer or bud?
Um... whiskey sour?
Excuse me.
You're Alice Kinnon, aren't you?
Yeah.
We met at that party in sag harbor,
Labor day weekend.
You were just coming in as I was leaving,
And you asked me where the kitchen was.
Do you remember?
I do remember getting to the kitchen.
Uh, excuse us.
We're here sort of as a group.
If you don't mind?
Excuse me.
Why did you say that?
I didn't like the look of him at all.
Didn't you notice how he was eyeballing you?
Creepy.
Frankly, I thought he might've been the guy
That bothered me on the subway.
I'm sorry if I overreacted.
Poor guy.
It's no big deal.
That kind of thing happens all the time.
Anyway, you've got Tom.

Do you remember the conversation we had
Labor day weekend?
Had a huge impact on me.
Really?
Jennifer and I had been talking all year
About either acknowledging
The permanence of our relationship and marrying
Or finally just breaking up.
I had no idea you were even dating anyone.
I thought you knew.
No. We've been together since college.
But the weekend after labor day,
We had this long talk.
Jennifer proposed a trial separation,
Which normally I'd have considered ridiculous,
But I couldn't help thinking of you
And went along.
Out of some sort of
Residual loyalty to Jennifer,
I didn't call you immediately
And instead started coming to the club.
I'm not a very good dancer, but...
No, you are.
I was also curious if the sexual revolution
Went as far as everyone said it had.
But emotionally, I couldn't handle it.
I got so depressed, and... when I saw you that night,
You were... a vision,
Not just of loveliness, but of... virtue... and sanity.
What?
I shouldn't talk about it.
I'll just end up sounding like an idiot.
No, what?
You're very sexy
And good-Looking and modern and hot.
But what I was craving
Was a sort of sentient individual
Who wouldn't abandon her intelligence
To hop into bed with every guy she meets
In a nightclub.
Why... why is it that when people have
Sex-With-Strangers on their mind,
Their I.Q. Just drops, like, 40 points?
All that affected
Sexy seductress slinking around?
And uncle scrooge is sexy?
I mean, my god, is there no limit?
No. That was to...
Do you think I'm an idiot?
I'm so sick of all the lies and nonsense!
Alice?
Alice, what's wrong?
What happened?
Mcgrath! Where is he?
I'd say it's definitely not a good idea
To approach van tonight.
There he is.
Mcgrath!
Drew Mcgrath.
You're out of here right now.
What?
Bernie. Bernie!
Where is he? Here he is.
Bernie, this guy's through.
What's going on?
We had a public safety situation in the front.
This jerk comes out, trying to make it worse.
Is this true?
Public safety situation?
Give me a break.
It was a joke. I'm sorry.
We had a public safety situation.
The cops came. It was no joke.
I tease him a tiny bit.
No teasing, des.
No teasing?
Either he goes or I do.
Come on, van. Des, grow up.
Cut it out.
Ok. Sorry.
It's the ad guy.
So, it's the dancing ad man.
You're finished.
Ok, I work in advertising.
Is that a crime?
What's happening in this country?
There they are! Get 'em!
Get the tin man. Get him.
Get this jerk out of the club.
You're fired, des. You're out of here.
You can't fire me, van.
Only Bernie can fire me.
Ok.
You're fired.
And take this yuppie scum with you.
Good riddance!
Yuppie scum?
In college, before dropping out,
I took a course in the propaganda uses of language.
One objective is to deny other people's humanity
Or even right to exist.
In the men's lounge,
Someone scrawled "kill yuppie scum."
Do yuppies even exist?
No one says, "I am a yuppie."
It's always the other guy who's a yuppie.
I think for a group to exist,
Somebody has to admit to be part of it.
Of course yuppies exist.
Most people would say you two are prime specimens.
We're not yuppies!
You think we're yuppies?
You're seriously saying you're not yuppies?
No.
Yuppie stands for "young upwardly mobile professional."
Nightclub flunky is not a professional category.
Contrary to popular belief,
Junior-Level ad jobs don't pay well at all.
I wish we were yuppies:
Young, upwardly mobile, professional.
Those are good things, not bad things.
Where we going?
Rex's. Oh, no.
What's wrong with rex's?
Well, you can't dance there,
And it's full of boring preppies.
Oh, and we're so interesting.
You can dance at rex's.
Yeah, but why rex's?
Why not some other place?
Well, for one thing,
Everyone at the club knows that I go there,
So when they come looking for me,
I wanna be there.
Why would they come looking for you?
What happened tonight was a mistake,
Which even now Bernie's probably very much regretting.
He's a smart guy.
Not without good qualities... even if very few.
I wouldn't be very surprised if he's already called rex's
To retract my dismissal.
How can you be so sure of that?
Well, I'm not sure of it.

Hey. Hey, rex.
Welcome to rex's.
Alice, you look like you've seen
The dark side of the moon.
What did Tom say?
No. I feel much better.
I love your idea of social life as a group,
Without all this ferocious pairing off.
I couldn't have stood being alone tonight.
I thought Bernie was smarter than that.
What a blunder.
When they do call, we'll get you immediately.
Thanks, rex.
Rex is such a great guy.
Yeah. Charlotte says she can tell if a guy's gay or not
Just by looking in his eyes.
How?
Maybe it's related to how they look at you.
It's hard to define,
But I think women can tell.
I can't.
Are Jimmy or I gay?
Come on, don't.
Jimmy?
No.
Well, not your eyes,
But you do have a gay mouth.
A gay mouth?
I have a gay mouth?
What does that mean?
Just what I said.
It's true, des. Your mouth does look gay.
God! How moronic can you get?
What nonsense!
Don't think I don't know your whole act.
Excuse me?
Pretending to be gay
To get sympathy from women
While cruelly dumping them,
And to seem cooler than you actually are.
I despise your whole pathetic act.
You're not fit to lick the boots
Of my real gay friends.
Well, I don't want to lick the boots
Of your real gay friends.
You know, I could be gay.
I see through you completely.
Oh, you see through me completely.
Yeah, I do.
That's the dark side of feminism.
What?
You have a kind of free pass to make any kind of wounding
Or derogatory comment you want.
I am hardly a militant feminist.
No, you're not.
A militant feminist would be a lot fairer.
It's women like you whose attitudes to men
Are so dehumanizing.
Like what?
That men are swine,
Obsessed with large breasts
And the sex act,
Devoid of any idealistic or romantic sensibility
When in fact,
We have that idealistic sensibility
In spades.
For instance, you have no idea
What men really think about women's breasts.
What do men think about women's breasts?
Well, it's not something you just blurt out.
It's far more complicated and nuanced than that.
Ok, I'll tell you a story.
When I was in college,
There was a girl I had a crush on
Who always had older boyfriends,
Invariably some senior.
Finally, they all graduated,
And one night we went back to her room alone.
Suddenly, her shirt was off,
And I was confronted with these breasts,
Which turned out to be completely surprising
And frankly, disconcerting.
They were rather large and not ugly
Or especially strange-Shaped,
But in all the time that
I had thought about her,
These breasts had never figured.
She took off her shirt so quickly,
There was no time for adjustment,
And I said something arrogant about it,
As if her abrupt unveiling of her largish breasts
Was somehow going to slay my swinish male self,
As if I hadn't already been slayed
On a much higher level.
Her name was Alice, too.
Oh, come on, des.
You know that's not true.
What do you mean, it isn't true?
Her name wasn't Alice.
Well, I'm not gonna use her real name.
Would you like to dance?
Do you mind?

If what's bothering you relates to Tom,
I wouldn't take it personally.
Did you know Tom and Jennifer
Had a trial separation,
Which was to end tonight?
What you might not know
Is that about a week ago,
They started seeing each other on the sly,
Cheating on their trial separation.
How do you know that?
Working at the club,
You find out all kinds of things.
You know, this is the way people used to dance in bars
In the old days.
Do people ever really dance in bars?
I thought that was a myth.
People my older brother's age, uh, they did.
Your brother must be a lot older.
Before disco,
This country was a dancing wasteland.
You know the woodstock generation of the 1960s
That were so full of themselves
And conceited?
None of those people could dance.
Huh.

What happened over there?
I think she noticed
That, for a moment, I flinched.
She dropped me like a rock.
I was crushed.
I couldn't take it, so I dropped out
And got in the night club business early,
Thanks to which
I probably owe my success today.
Let's share a cab.
We're thinking of going.
You're all going?
Yeah.
Have they called yet from the club?
I don't think they will call.
Bernie will probably send some emissary.
That's more his style.
What should we do with the oz costumes,
Just, uh, bring 'em by the club tomorrow?
Actually, those costumes are mine.
Just get 'em back to me when you can.
I thought we were here as a group.
You talked about the tremendous importance
Of group social life.
Well, it's really late.
Yeah, Alice, it's getting really late.
We'd better get going.
Hey, thanks again, des.
Ciao.
Bye.
Bye.
All week charlotte's been talking about
The tremendous importance of group social life,
Opposing all this ferocious pairing off.
Well, group social life has its place,
But at a certain point,
Other biological factors come into play.
Our bodies weren't really designed
For group social life.
A certain amount of pairing off
Was always part of the original plan.
God, I can't believe you'd say that.
What?
What did I say?
What you mean to say is that they've all gone back
To screw their brains out?!
No, I didn't say that!
I said they were going to pair off.
Well, wait, don't go!
I didn't mean to say anything
Anyone could be offended by.
Oh, thank god. He's here.
Des, Bernie regrets what happened.
It was a mistake, and he wants you back.
I'm sorry. I know why you're so upset.
I mean,
I know what really happened with Tom.
What?!
That he thought
You were really slutty or something.
That's so stupid!
You can't worry about what misinterpreters think!
That's so unfair!
Come back to my place. We should talk.
Nothing will happen!
I just need somebody to talk to.
Maybe you do, too.

I'm sure it was Jimmy.
It's very quiet.
Get out! Get out!
That was pretty bad.
God!
What's the matter now?
What?
All the noise...
Clomping around, banging pans.
Sorry. I didn't realize it.
You obviously intended it.
What do you mean?
That's very aggressive.
You don't clomp around, banging pans
For no reason.
Like what reason?
You know perfectly well.
Because I only bang pans?
Well, frankly, that's not what I heard.
Ok. Anything I did that was wrong,
I apologize for.
But anything I did that was not wrong,
I don't apologize for.

What?
The memoir by the Dalai lama's older brother?
Oh.
I'd like to bring it up
At Wednesday's editorial meeting.
You really liked that?
Other people liked it, too?
Yeah.
Ok. I'll take another look.
You know, it's considered a little self-Indulgent
To read too much of a manuscript
If it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
Have you known holly long?
Just since we found the apartment. Why?
She's very, uh... quiet, isn't she?
Well, I would say, not more than normal.
Your standard of normal could be different from other people's.
How do you mean?
I don't understand that.
I guess what
I'm asking is...
You do like holly, don't you?
Yeah, of course.
But... she is intelligent, isn't she?
Well, sometimes I question

Congratulations, Alice.
Yeah, your first book. Great.
It could be a bestseller.
Charlotte. Oh, charlotte.
That was so moving,
What you said about our obligation to writers.
Thanks.
And how often we fall short of that.
Well, let's face it,
Most authors are still conceited dopes.
Oh, you... You can't say that.
You're an editor.
You don't have to deal with them on a daily basis.
When you're an assistant,
It's harder to dodge their calls.
Good going, Alice.
I'm really glad we got this book.
I understand that you know some people at the club.
Do you think that maybe, um,
Sometime you could, uh, get us in there some night?
Yeah. Certainly. We'll arrange that.
Very good. Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Dan.
Sure.
Do you have any idea why Jimmy's
Suddenly so interested in your social life?
No. He's interested in my social life?
Haven't you noticed?
He's always wondering
Why you don't go out or go to the club.
He is?
You know, Alice,
You've been hanging around the apartment a lot.
You've kind of set up office there.
None of the rest of us has any privacy.
The railroad apartment wasn't my idea.
Yeah, that's true, but it's just odd
That you're so much friendlier to Jimmy
Now he's with me.
I just think the situation's kind of awkward.
What do you want me to do,
Promise not to talk to him anymore?
I'm sure you know perfectly well

You're here to see van?
You don't mind, do ya?
Well, I sorta do.
I hate asking that guy for favors.
They're not gonna keep me on much longer
If I can't get clients into the club.
It's that important to you
To stay in advertising?
Ok. Better see him while he's still on his upswing.
Hey, des.
Hi.
God, what happened to you?
Jesus. Josh, you're a mess.
I'm a mess.
I got to talk to you.
You sure you don't want to clean up a little?
It's kind of serious.
I'll look for Alice and charlotte,
See if they've come in.
That's Audrey Rouget,
The youngest person ever to be made an editor
In the history of farrar, Straus.
How do you know her?
She interviewed me.
How did it go?
Have you ever been in an interview
And gotten the impression they see through you completely?
I didn't get an offer.
You don't want to clean up a little?
No.
You know, you look really bad.
I know. That's actually good in my work.
It puts people at ease, looking like this.
They feel, frankly, superior to me
And say things they ordinarily wouldn't.
It's very disarming.
Phew! What happened?!
I was having drinks
With some friends in the village,
And there was this terrible guy
Really bothering this girl,
So I decided to intervene,
But it turns out they were married.
What's this now? You're not here
On official business, are you?
Knowing that we went to college together,
They asked me to talk to you.
Who is "they"?
I can't tell you.
I couldn't believe you'd be involved
In the kinds of things
That have been going on here
And told them so.
I consider you a person of some integrity,
Except, you know,
In your relations with women.

Take the tortoise and the hare.
Ok, the tortoise won one race.
Do you think the hare is really gonna lose
Any more races to turtles? Not on your life.
I liked that tortoise.
So do I, but if you were a betting person,
Would you say, "that tortoise won against the hare.
In future races I'm backing him"?
No. That race was almost certainly a fluke,
And, afterwards, the tortoise is still a tortoise,
And the hare, a hare.
Domestic beer. A bud.
Mm-Hmm.
Vodka tonic, please.
Um, I'll just have a coca-Cola.
You're not drinking?
Alice is not having a cocktail?
I can't believe it.
Well, I'm not.
What is it?
Do you have strep throat or some flu
You're taking antibiotics for?
Oh, my god! You have the clap, don't you?
You're on antibiotics,
And the doctor told you not to drink
Or something.
That's why you're not drinking.
Usually there's no coming between Alice
And a cocktail.
How could you?
No. I'm sure I'm right.
The bottle of tetracycline
On her bureau top.
Tetracycline's specific for the clap.
How could you say that?!
Oh, come on. Everyone gets something.

Alice.
I am so, so sorry.
I should never have said that.
I have some sort of sick compulsion
To say everything that occurs to me.
I just want to let you know,
As soon as I can find a new rooming situation,
I'm moving out. I can't take it anymore.
It's not possible.
You're not serious.
Just let me know when you're ready to go.
Ok.
Please, Alice.
Rooming with you and holly
Has been the most important thing
To happen to me in my life.
You're the first woman friends I've ever had.
The anger you're feeling now
Is actually more justified than you know.
When we were at Hampshire,
I really hated you.
You seemed so moralistic and judgmental.
I had no idea, then, how you really were.
When guys wanted to ask you out,
I'd talk them out of it.
Oh, my god. I can't believe how evil I was.
But I've completely changed.
If you will give me another chance,
I'll be the best friend you've ever had.
If the apartment situation weren't so impossible,
I'd move out now.
I can understand how you'd feel that way.
You're right to.
But things aren't always as they seem.
Bad and inexcusable as what I said back there
Might have been, I think you'll find
It'll actually improve your reputation
With these guys enormously.
You'll be more popular than ever. Watch.
Vd's not all bad.
You'll find there are actually
Positive aspects to it.
What?
Well, you know that "please inform
All previous partners" thing?
It's actually a terrific way
To get back in touch
With guys you might have liked
But have lost contact with.
Just in my own experience,
It's twice led to renewed relationships
With guys that lasted quite a while
And were really... sweet.
I'm not talking about herpes infections,
Which are far more serious
And apparently incurable,
Just standard vd and other conditions
Easily treatable with antibiotics.
God, are you following me or something?
You said you weren't taking anything.
Well, I'm not. It was a gift.
I never buy the stuff,
And anyway, it hardly affects me.
Oh, no.
Actually, what I'm high about
Is the situation with Alice.
This makes her seem much more accessible.
She's not operating on a plane
So far removed from the rest of us.
There's hope for me.
What did josh want to talk to you about?
Is everything ok?
Uh, no... not exactly.
I'm sorry to bug you about this,
But I'd be really grateful
If we could talk with van soon.
The way it's going, if I can't get people in here,
I'm going to lose my job.
Des! You lied to me!
I thought you were a wonderful man,
But it was all lies!
No!
You said you loved me!
And then you said you were gay,
But you're not!
Everyone knew but me!
You completely humiliated me!
I could be gay.
You're saying again you're gay?
Tell me honestly,
Have you had sex with men?!

Between games, as planned,
A huge box containing thousands of disco records
Was blown up.
The rest was unplanned.
Fans stormed out onto the field in the thousands.
Disco records were hurled like frisbees.
Bonfires were set. Bottles where thrown.
The batting cage was torn down and destroyed.
Fistfights broke out.
Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau,
At his press conference,
Congratulated prosecutors on their successful convictions
In the probe of...
...speaking for the first time on his real estate task force's
18 convictions of executives at 6 commercial brokerages,
Promised a vigorous prosecution
Of corporate and white collar crime
In a wide-Ranging series of investigations...
I'll just be a second.
Alice, congratulations on the TV sale.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
How's holly?
Fine.
Is she, um, going out with anyone?
Yeah, this really nice guy who went to Denver university
And works in real estate.
He found her this incredibly cheap apartment.
She no longer lives with you guys?
You hold what happened against me.
Not that you broke up,
Just that you go out with people
Based primarily on looks.
Holly's also very nice.
A lot of people are nice.
You only asked out the fabulously good-Looking one.
You hold that against me.
Well, pretty shallow.
You know, Alice, except for politics,
We've got a lot in common.
We're both pretty serious
And, I think, respect each other's
Bases for judgment.
Occasionally,
I get reactionary thoughts, too.
I'm not reactionary.
Well, aesthetically.
Oh, well, aesthetically.
You mean you think I gave it to you?
How can you be sure?
I'm sure.
Well, you were a lot more active than I was.
You were obviously very experienced.
No.
Oh, come on.
How did you know all that?
Well, I read a lot.
You must've been with some guys.
You weren't a virgin.
I didn't consider myself a virgin,
But... what?
I don't know.
Technically... what?
If I'm making love,
The man... spurts... outside the woman,
Does that count as sexual intercourse?
"Spurts"?
If it squirts outside, without getting in,
Does that count as losing your virginity?
No part of the man got in at any time?
I don't think so.
I think part has to get in... to be considered sexual intercourse.
So then I was a virgin.
Oh... I can't believe that.
The first time you make love, I...
I give you both "g" and an "h" infection.
"H"?
Your move.
I'm beginning to think that maybe
That old system of people getting married
Based on mutual respect and shared aspirations,
And then slowly, over time,
Earning each other's love and admiration,
Worked the best.
Well, we'll never know.
Almost ready.
God, waiting around all night
For the unemployed guy to get around to shaving.
You're so busy you can't shower until midnight?
Excuse me. Unemployed is not who I am.
I'm a fully-Employed person
Who just happens not to have a job right now,
Largely because of some structural problems
In the advertising industry.
I'm sorry. That was really inconsiderate.
Please forgive me.

Of course, if you talk enthusiastically
About your work in advertising,
You sound like a total cretin.
No. Your enthusiasm
Is actually enormously appealing.
In fact, I used to not think so well
Of people in advertising,
But it's one of the great things
About getting out of college and into the real worid,
How experience changes and improves your views.
During college, I remember seeing couples
With crying babies and thinking "how horrible."
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time
With my niece and nephew.
Saturday, I took my niece, who's 7,
To see the Disney movie,
Lady and the tramp. She loved it,
Was so cute.
I'm beginning to fall in love
With the whole idea of having kids.
I hate that movie.
What?
It's so... tacky,
Not to mention depressing.
This sweet movie about cute cartoon dogs,
You found depressing?
There is something depressing about it.
And it's not really about dogs.
Except for some superficial bow-Wow stuff at the start,
The dogs all represent human types,
Which is where it gets into real trouble.
Lady, the ostensible protagonist,
Is a fluffy blonde cocker spaniel
With absolutely nothing on her brain.
She's great-Looking, but... Let's be honest...
Incredibly insipid.
Tramp, the love interest,
Is a smarmy braggart of the most obnoxious kind:
An oily jailbird out for a piece of tail
Or whatever he can get.
Come on.
No. He's a self-Confessed chicken thief
And all-Around sleazeball.
What's the function of a film of this kind?
Essentially, it's a primer on love and marriage
Directed at very young people,
Imprinting on their little psyches the idea
That smooth-Talking delinquents
Recently escaped from the local pound
Are a good match for nice giris from sheltered homes.
When in 10 years, the icky human version
Of tramp shows up around the house,
Their hormones will be racing,
And no one'll understand why. Films like this
Program women to adore jerks.
God, you're nuts.
The only sympathetic character,
The little scotty who's so loyal and concerned about lady,
Is mocked as old-Fashioned and irrelevant
And shunted off to the side.
Isn't the whole point that tramp changes?
Ok, maybe in the past he stole chickens,
Ran around without a license,
And wasn't always sincere
With members of the opposite sex.
But through his love for lady
And the beneficent influences
Of fatherhood and matrimony, he changes... and becomes a valued member of that,
You know, rather idyllic household.
I don't think people really change that way.
We can change our context, but we can't change ourselves.
What does that mean?
Well, you've changed.
Come on, des.
That's a little different.
I agree with josh.
The scotty is the only admirable character.
It would have been a much better movie
If lady'd ended up with him.
I'm really surprised.
I think tramp really changed.
Maybe he wanted to change, or tried to change,
But there's not a lot of integrity there.
First, he'd be hanging around the house,
Drinking and watching ball games
And maybe knocking lady around a bit,
But pretty soon he'll be back
Down at the town dump chasing tail.
Oh, give me a break.
Are you taking your medication,
'Cause what you're saying is
Completely nuts! God, des... no! I think people should know
That our friend here has a certain condition.
How can Morgenthau shut up! Employ you?
He knows about mass. Mental health
And the loony tunes junior year?
Of course he knows about it.
God!
Jimmy, do you know where Alice is?
No. I don't know where she is.
Uh, excuse me.
Were you at Leo Burnett in Chicago?
Oh, my god, how are you?
Um, do you know betty?
Jimmy Steinway, hi.
Hi.
Are you still with ishmoco?
Yeah. There's a sales conference at the Americana.
I'm actually with the international side now,
Based in Spain.
How's that?
Barcelona's beautiful,
But, in human terms, uh, pretty cold.
How 'bout you?
I was at Mccallum, but just got sacked.
Have you found anything else?
No.
Any leads?
No.
You know, there're a lot of agencies in Spain
Looking for people with experience from here.
There's one in Madrid
Some Burnett people have affiliated with.
I could give 'em a call.
That sounds great.
Michael.
Good times.
I don't identify with tramp at all.
I was just sticking up for him
Because no one else was.
I actually identify
With the loyal scotty dog, too.
I've changed.

Well, if I'm going to court,
I wear a laundry-Ironed shirt,
But, otherwise, I do it myself.
That's a great moment in life
When you can start
Sending all your shirts out for laundering.
At the agency, after my last promotion,
I briefly had that.
In any case, I doubt I'll be working there much longer.
What?
I'm thinking of quitting.
You can't do that.
Why not? What's it to you?
You assured me if I helped you,
You'd be around to protect des.
Well, the situation's changed.
How's it changed?
I can't say.
You can't say.
Maybe des is more involved than I thought.
Or more involved with someone you know.
That's a conflict, josh.
I still can't believe Alice is really serious about des.
Why not?
She seems smarter than that.
That doesn't matter. There's something
Deeply ingrained in human biology.
Women prefer bad over weak and indecisive
And unemployed.
I don't know about that.
You think they do prefer weak, indecisive,
And unemployed?

Did you know that in college,
My senior paper was on Ernest Hemingway?
Thanks, baby.
I'm not a nice person, des.
But some things are important,
Such as loyalty.
Loyalty's not eyewash, not like niceness.
I've been loyal to you, des.
I could've fired you, lots of times,
But never did.
Maybe you're not aware of this, des,
But there's some sort of investigation underway.
I think to myself,
"how could this happen?
"How could they get this information?
"Has some disgruntled employee,
"Former or current, informed on us?
"Is there some sort of spy here?
How could agents even get in?"
I mean, really,
They would stand out in this crowd
And, normally, not get past the door.
Do you know how they got in?
Uh, no. Could van be letting them in?
They're coming in as ad agency clients.
What?
Oh, I can't believe it.
After all I did for that guy.
So, you don't know anything about this investigation?
No! Well, a sort of acquaintance of mine
Who now works in Morgenthau's office approached me,
But I didn't tell him anything.
You didn't tell me about that.
I didn't think it was important.
It only just happened.
When? Tonight. Just now.

It's a problem.

That doesn't matter.
What?
When everything comes down,
It's gonna be very rough.
Your whole life will be open for examination,
And it might not look so good.
Cut out the drugs, des.
What?
Don't make such a spectacle of yourself as a drug user.
Don't receive them, don't consume them,
And don't pass them on to others.
What are you talking about?
You could be charged with dealing.
Dealing? Those were gifts!
Well... who's accusing me of this?
This is you, isn't it, josh?
That's a conflict. We both like the same girl.

Oh, god!
Oh, my god!
I didn't know anything about it.
The agency just funneled
Clients they wanted to get into the club through me.
Usually, before I got into the car,
I hadn't even met them.
I just assumed they were clients from out of town.
That the I.R.S. Was our largest client
Didn't occur to me then.
I swear I didn't know anything about it, des,
At first.
You scumbag.
Josh promised me you'd be protected.
Oh, great. What's a little shocking
Is that they'd do something so obvious and clumsy
And move so fast,
No matter how richly I may feel you deserved it.
These were just some creeps
Mad van'd turned them away before.
Van's operating under tremendous pressure.
I'm starting to feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.
Oh, great. That's priceless.
You and van, oh, I love that.
Oh!
Want a snort?
Guess not.
I have a very bad feeling about the club, des.
It's like a meteorite is headed straight for it.
It's gonna destroy everything.
The greatest club the worid has ever seen
Is going to be smashed to smithereens.
Yeah, well, I don't think it'll be a meteorite.
Bye.
Alice and I are having breakfast together.
It's a date. You can't come.
Sorry.
Try to get some sleep.
That's what guys do who want to date you?
They say they have a book idea?
Maybe.
Did he say what the book was?
He said he had some crazy ideas
For a book on the criminal justice system.
Of course. That makes sense.
Crazy ideas are the kind that josh would have.
Be careful of that guy.
I was there when he flipped out.
Really scary.
He got up on a table at a cafeteria off Harvard square
And started weirdly singing this hymn.
Apparently, religious mania is highly typical
Of manic depression entering its manic phase.
Josh is not just your garden-Variety loon.
He is a serious nutcase.
What gets me is that this serious nutcase
Now presumes to judge others.
You really think the neurological effects of coffee
Is similar to that of cocaine?
That's what I read somewhere.
In addition to amazing stories,
There are a lot
Of entertaining prosecutors' anecdotes.
And then there's the whole culture
Of the downtown legal district.
It could be good.
Like everything, it all depends on execution.
This is sort of related.
It's an article I wrote for Harper's
During law school.
Did you really just want to have lunch
To discuss a book proposal?
Um... no.
How serious are you and des?
Is it absolutely, completely,
Irrevocably serious?
Did he tell you the story about
How he was traumatized by a Radcliffe girl
Taking off her shirt,
Suddenly revealing her largish breasts,
Which he never thought about before?
He tells that story all the time
To get sympathy and to justify himself,
As if he were the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity.
That wasn't true?
No, it was true. He was the victim
Of female aggressiveness and duplicity,
But so was everyone else.
Not everyone then went on a rampage
Exploiting the opposite sex.
He thinks his problem is just that he falls in love a lot.
Well, a lot of people fall in love a lot.
I'm really surprised you'd be taken in by him.
You should notice I didn't answer your original question.
My original question,
Whether you were absolutely committed to des,
You didn't answer?
What does "loon" mean?
Des calls me that.
I sort of like it.
It's, uh, short for "lunatic"
And also the lake bird with the eerie call.
It's the other terms des uses for me...
"Nutcase,"
"freakazoid," etcetera...
I kind of mind.
A lot of people like to say
They won't take "no" for an answer.
I just wanted you to know
I'm not one of them.
I can be easily discouraged.
I will take "no" for an answer.
Ok.
No.
You don't mean that.
No.
I'm sorry.
She's not in right now.
Ok. I'll have her call you back. Thank you.
Alice, sorry.
What?
You better see bob.
Bob wants to see you right away.
It's something bad?
The author of your
Tibet book doesn't exist.
He's a fraud.
Carol thinks it could be worse
Than the Clifford Irving case.
Carol thinks it's as bad as the Clifford Irving case.
Turns out the author isn't the Dalai lama's brother,
But a Los Ángeles writer named John Disimio.
It's a shame. This is a really good book.
Dan thinks it's one of the best things
Ever written on Tibetan Buddhism.
What a mess.
I'm sorry I haven't been more of a help.
I've been a little preoccupied myself.
I'm late for my period.
How late?
A day.
A day late, and you're worried?
I'm sure I'm pregnant.
But isn't that what you wanted?
What do you mean?
Well, I thought you said
You wanted to have
Jimmy Steinway's babies.
Yeah, but not this way.
I'm not an addict.
I'm a habitual user.
I'm sick of you and that nut case
Going around judging everybody.
"Oh, he's an addict."
"Oh, he's basically honorable
Except for his treatment of women."
I am not a womanizer.
In fact, I hate womanizers.
In any case, Alice completely changed all that.
Isn't that a little morbid?
Morbid?
Why take on all that baggage?
Isn't he a bit of a sicko?
From the start, you know he's defective.
Usually you don't find that out
Until much later.
And what if you have kids?
It can be hereditary.
One thing about Jimmy:
I know he'll make a good father.
There's always some problem, some baggage.
Oh, my god, you're serious.
Well, not necessarily.
Coming.
Tonight I'm gonna tell Jimmy.
Wish me luck.
You know, I think my father could have
Been an undiagnosed manic-Depressive.
Hi. Uh, do you know josh is downstairs waiting?
Yeah. Thanks.
Bye.
Bye. Bye.
Alice is so great.
I've gotta be a better friend to her.
Yeah.
Before leaving the D.A.'S office,
I'd like at least once the chance to use
The expression, "book this clown!"
Heh. I thought only police said that.
No, I think an a.D.A. Could,
In certain circumstances,
Perhaps not very typical.
Are you aware
All your clothes are slightly big?
I'm still waiting for my growing spurt.
Both my father and brother are over 6'3".
You can still grow in your twenties.
There are cases on record.
Tall people tend to have great personalities,
This kind, compassionate comprehension
Of the rest of the worid.
My father and brother are both that way.
What's wrong?
Just remembering something.
What?
It's kind of maudlin.
It was here
My depression first descended.
Oh.
"To the valiant seamen
"Who perished in the Maine
By fate unwarned, in death unafraid."
Isn't this the strangest,
Most forlorn monument?
Yeah, it's very sad.
What happened with your depression?
Nothing at first.
I just went back to
Cambridge very depressed.
Then there was the incident at the hayes-Bickford,
After which I was taken to mass. Mental for observation.
While there, I cut my hand trying to open a stuck window,
And they put me on a suicide watch,
Though I don't think I was ever really suicidal,
At least no more than a lot of people that age.
But you're ok now?
Uh... yeah.
Actually, a lot of people spend considerable sums of money
To get the high I get absolutely naturally.
Now, with lithium,
Which is, in fact, a naturally occurring salt,
I can stay on a perfectly even keel,
Perhaps too even.
Did they prescribe lithium right away?
Lithium wasn't so standard then.
There was a lot of muddling through various therapies.
Because my right hand was bandaged,
I used my left to write friends cards,
Which was a mistake.
My handwriting looked weird and really scared people.
I... I don't think
I was ever that... that badly off, but others might disagree.
Do you know the words
To the hymn dear lord and father of mankind?
While I was in the hospital, it became a sort of mantra.
♪♪ Dear lord and father of mankind ♪♪
♪♪ Forgive our foolish ways ♪♪
♪♪ Reclothe us in our rightful mind ♪♪
♪♪ In purer lives, thy service find ♪♪
♪ ♪♪ In deeper reverence, praise ♪
♪♪ Drop thy still dews of quietness ♪♪
♪♪ ♪♪ Till all our strivings cease
♪♪ Take from our souls the strain and stress ♪♪
♪♪ And let our ordered lives confess ♪♪
♪♪ The beauty of thy peace ♪♪
♪♪ Breathe through the heat of our desire ♪♪
♪♪ Thy coolness and thy balm ♪♪
♪♪ Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire ♪♪
♪♪ Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire ♪♪
♪♪ O, still, small voice of calm ♪♪
What's wrong?
You think I'm a wacko?
What's wrong?
Uh, I don't know.
Charlotte's in terrible pain.
It's her back.
No, nothing happened.
We were just talking.
About what?
Charlotte said she had something important
She wanted to talk to me about,
But before we got to that, her period started.
Afterwards, I mentioned that it might be a good time
To start thinking about
Whether we were really right for one another
Or we should start thinking about,
You know, breaking up.
Josh hasn't called since that night.
Of course he hasn't.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on. You told me.
He sang a hymn or something.
You were totally weirded out.
I can't believe how intolerant you are.
Some of those old hymns are beautiful.
I've sung them on the street myself.
I didn't realize it was so controversial.

There are a couple of alternatives
That aren't that that-Bad.
First, some guy who's already been around a lot
And almost certainly has it anyway,
So it'd be no problem
And, in fact, would give you something in common.
The other would be some guy
So idealistic and in love with you
That he'd want to commit himself to you
Prior to that step because his dream would be
To be with you forever, always, exclusively anyway.
I think skip's a bit that way.
What?
I need to see des. It's urgent.
He's busy.
He'll wanna know this.
Des!
Des!
Des, open up!
I didn't let him in, des.
He got by me.
Jesus Christ. Are you out of you mind?
It's about to start.
Get rid of all your "gifts"
And anything else you might have.
Oh.
Step aside. Coming through.
Names.
Take this guy at the door.
We're on the list.
Jesus Christ, you're not gonna use that against me
With Alice, are you?
Francesca was just feeling terribly needy tonight.
It has nothing to do with how I feel about Alice.
You're not gonna take unfair advantage of that.
Ok.
All right, let's go!
I'm a cop.
This way, gentlemen.
All right, let's go!
Downstairs first. Harry, jack.
We're gonna come in here. This way.
You can't touch those.
Those are my personal papers.
Yeah. Well, they're part of the premises now,
And as such, the warrant applies. Sam.
Book this clown.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing here in the dark?
I was just resting.
Have you seen josh at all?
Yeah.
Is he ok?
Sure.
Why wouldn't he be ok?
I don't know.
He hasn't called in a while.
Josh is a bit thin-Skinned.
He's the kind of guy who will take no for an answer.
Sag harbor.
Did you know I was sort of infatuated with you then?
I assumed you preferred Tom.
Also, you seemed a little... irritating.
How was I irritating?
Well... you weren't.
There's no chance of you
Getting infatuated with me again, is there?
Just had to confirm that.
Let me keep your passport for you.
No.
Come on, help me out.
Should people just be allowed
To steal from each other and the government,
And out of selfishness or indifference
Or a kind of fashionable cynicism,
The rest of us do nothing?
I thought better of you than that.
You did?
Well, wrong again.
Listen, you've got all their books and all their documents.
Why do you need me who knew practically nothing?
This is the only body I've got.
Good-Bye, josh.
Kennedy airport.
Are you a bit of a cad,
Leaving town with your girlfriend in the hospital?
It might look that way.
But it isn't?
I've been through this before.
After graduation,
Laurie and I were gonna break up,
But the same day,
She came down with terrible back spasms.
I hung around the hospital all summer,
And I almost bankrupted her parents.
And as soon as I left town, she recovered.
By going away and putting an ocean between us...
I.E., making a definitive break...
Charlotte's likely to recover much faster.
What makes you think putting an ocean between you
Necessarily means a definitive break?
That's a depressing thought.
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf in Spain.
I'm gonna turn over several new leaves.
You know that Shakespearean admonition,
"To thine own self be true"?
It's premised on the idea
That "thine own self" is something pretty good,
Being true to which is commendable,
But what if "thine own self" is not so good?
What if it's pretty bad?
Wouldn't it be better in that case
Not to be true to thine own self?
See? That's my situation.
The one I like is, "et tu, brute."
There are different ways of being loyal.
Some may seem on the surface disloyal,
But they're not.
There's a higher loyalty.
The way I see it,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar.
By stabbing him in the back,
Brutus was a good friend to Caesar?
You know, I probably should have stayed and testified.
Josh is right.
Bernie is a bad guy, probably worse than they know.
That's what van thinks.
Van's cooperating.
Staying and cooperating would have been the right thing to do,
But instead I'm running like a rat
Because to thine own self be true.
They say I can probably go home tomorrow.
Great.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Do you think Jimmy's going away could have
Had anything to do with him, you know... having some sort
Of bizarre, pathetic crush on you?
I don't know.
Well, did he ever say anything?
Yes.
What?
Well, he...
"Why don't you love me
Instead of jerks like des and josh?"
That kind of thing?
I knew it.
You bitch!
I knew it was something like that.
I don't think I want to room with you anymore.
Being around you hasn't been good for me or my back.
I'd like you to move out.
I don't know how I'll afford it,
But my sanity and my integrity
Are more important to me than money.
I have to start looking out for myself now.
Have you heard the news?
No, what?
They're selling the company.
What?
We're merging with Simon & Schuster.
There'll be the usual consolidation
And economies of scale.
A lot of us are gonna lose our jobs.
God, that's sad.
I love the company.
They've been so great to us there.
Well, I don't know.
We were exploited,
But they were nice about it.
Maybe it'd be good if they got rid
Of some of the deadwood in that company,
Particularly if it meant paying the rest of us
Decently enough to live in this city
With at least a modicum of privacy.
Why don't we do something?
Like what?
Well, at this time of day,
Employed people often have lunch.
I can't. I've gotta go uptown.
Why?
Alice and I are having lunch.
You're having lunch with Alice?
Great. Let's all go.
It's, uh, at Lutece.
You're on unemployment
And taking Alice to Lutece?
Um, doesn't irrational expenditures
Signal the start of a manic phase?
If it were my invitation, you'd be right,
But it's not.
Alice is taking you to Lutece?
Why'd she take you?
Celebrating her promotion.
When Alice wants to celebrate something,
She calls you?
Alice made editor?
Associate editor.
Well, what happened with her book?
I thought it was some kind of fiasco.
What Alice did, rather cleverly,
Was shift the category
From nonfiction to self-Actualization.
The book jackets hadn't been printed yet.
Reincarnation, life after death...
Mumbo jumbo of all kinds
Has been highly commercial
Throughout the history of book publishing.
The first printed book was the bible.
Actually, I'm not upset I was laid off.
This'll motivate me to get a better job in television,
Which is where my interests truly lie.
I've watched television all my life.
If you're really
Interested in television,
You should come over and watch
Wild kingdom sometime.
Sure.
Are you taking the "e" train?
Yeah.
$2. Thanks.
Hey, van!
What happened?
Ah, the new owners couldn't make it work.
Finally had to hire people to stand outside,
Pretend that they couldn't get in.
Anyway, disco's over. It's dead.
What do you mean?
Well, people just aren't going out like they used to.
They're tired.
Some are sick or strung out.
It's not just the prosecutions
And all the owners that Bernie squealed on.
Could part of it be related to the herpes epidemic?
Maybe. I've got a friend
At Casablanca records and tapes,
And she says that, like, 2 months ago,
The bottom dropped out of all disco record sales.
Suddenly, it's... dead, over.
God, that's sad.
We're getting older.
We've lived through a period that's ended.
It's like dying a little bit.
Disco will never be over.
It will always live in our minds and hearts.
Something like this, that was this big
And this important and this great,
Will never die.
Oh, for a few years, maybe many years,
It'll be considered pass? And ridiculous.
It will be misrepresented
And caricatured and sneered at,
Or worse, completely ignored.
People will laugh about John Travolta,
Olivia newton-John, white polyester suits
And platform shoes and going like this.
Though we had nothing to do with those things
And still loved disco.
Those who didn't understand will never understand.
Disco was much more and much better than all that.
Disco was too great
And too much fun to be gone forever.
It's got to come back someday.
I just hope it will be in our own lifetimes.
Sorry. I've got a job interview this afternoon,
And I was trying to get revved up,
But most of what I said, I, uh, believe.
I was pretty furious when you had
My passport lifted, confiscated,
At the airport, but you were right.
I'm glad I stayed.
At least you saved me
From being stuck in some foreign city
With the likes of Jimmy Steinway.
But there's one thing I don't get.
You did a good job with the prosecution,
Getting Bernie to squeal that way.
Why'd they lay you off?
There was a conflict involving
Giving preferential treatment to a friend
Which they felt I handled badly.
Oh.
Well, congratulate Alice for us.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't envy her, though, stuck in book publishing.
Oof. Yeah.
I've gotta get to unemployment and sign up.
I'm going to Florida this afternoon.
So long.
Bye. Bye.
One of the things that makes me happy in life
Is knowing that I don't envy anyone.
I don't want to be anybody else
Or do anything but what I'm doing,
Which, right now, is nothing,
But I have good projects for the future.
Can I speak honestly?
Yeah.
You and I are similar.
We both got big personalities.
That's good. The worid, frankly, needs more big personalities.
But perhaps ours burn too brightly,
Are too big for people with normal,
Healthy-Size personalities like Alice
Or abnormal, healthy-Sized personalities like josh
Or itsy-Bitsy, teeny-Weeny,
Polka-Dot-Bikini-Size personalities
Like Jimmy Steinway.
That's why I'm confident
I'll ultimately be successful in television.
Absolutely. See, one of the problems
Of finding the right person and settling down
Is it takes all the fun and interest
Out of going to nightclubs.
I mean, if you're already living with somebody,
Why bother going out?
Getting seriously involved with someone
Really just means ruining your nightlife.
What I mean to say is,
Jimmy, Alice, Josh... so what?
That's what I say.
I think I agree with you.
