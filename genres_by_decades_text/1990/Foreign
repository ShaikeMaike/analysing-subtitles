I wanted to say you move like an Angel.
Thank you
But it's more than that.
You give, but not too much.
Your presence on stage is like an actor on film.
Walk, just walk.
It's difficult to do.
So let's walk forwards.
Now I feel I can't walk at all!
Find your center.
London
Good morning.
Coffee, and a... a croissant?
Any in black?
Black? Yes, I have black too.
Another nice model.
I'll be right back.
It was a real pleasure.
Good dancer!
Good morning.
Lots of Faxes, huh?
Do you think people's paths cross for a reason?
It depends if you believe in chance or destiny.
What do you believe?
I believe chance gives us the opportunity to create our destiny.
How?
With our will.
A question.
You believe in God?
Good luck in Hollywood!
I'm abandoning my film.
Really, Why?
I don't like the script.
Wasn't it your idea?
I wrote a film
I wouldn't want to make.
So what will you do?
I don t know.
Something more personal.
Maybe something about tango.
I didn't notice how late it was.
Where are you?
I waited where we said.
No, I'm sure we said...
OK, fine, it doesn't matter.
Good night.
Who is it?
We should define our relationship more clearly... set some limits.
I agree.
You know, I also wanted to say something.
I've had difficult experiences before... when I mixed the professional and the personal
It's dangerous.
It can be.
It can destroy everything.
You know,
I think
It's better to sublimate our attraction into our work.
Let go!
Stop thinking.
Less tension.
Do less
I'm not doing anything.
Your blocking... leaning.
Doing too much... using too much force.
Just center yourself.
Why are you moving your head?
Follow me here.
Here!
Couldn't you encourage me instead of... criticizing me...
I'm trying... I'm really trying.
You simply let go.
Let go! Let go!
I'm trying to!
-Yes, I know.
-I'll let go.
You're doing it alone.
Wait for me.
Very good
Alright
More direct.
More prepared.
More direct.
No, don't move your arm.
There's a moment... as if it stops...
Stay there... That's the idea.
Stay there?
-Why are you stopping?
-Because you are.
I'm not, I'm ready!
You are stopping.
That's it.
-Better?
-Much better.
It was very good.
For the first time.
Very good.
Why are you afraid of me?
I'm not afraid of you, but of your weakness.
What weakness?
Your emotional weakness.
I'm not weak, I'm expressive.
Could I direct films if I were weak?
I've never seen you direct.
What?
You don't know how to recognize what I do.
I have eyes.
I haven't seen you do anything.
You don't know how to use your eyes.
You only want to be looked at.
Not to look.
That's why you don't see.
That's why you know nothing about film!
You know nothing about tango.
You know nothing about me.
Maybe I don’t want to know anymore!
Then it's over between us.
What is?
Exactly!
You've been using me... to live out your little fantasies.
Bullshit!
Sure. Anything else?
Ladies and gentlemen... after 7 years, our very own Pablito Veron is back!
A big round of applause for Pablo Veron!
You really don’t know what kind of film it will be?
Not yet.
What did you tell the producers?
Lies.
All right, Pablo.
Shall I teach you something?
Yes, of course.
Say to me, I am a dancer.
I am...
Why? You know that already.
Suppose I write a scene. where I tell something important to me... that I feel I am a Jew.
And I say to you,
And you, Pablo?
And you reply, I'm a dancer.
Pause...
And you add, And a Jew.
I might say that.
Then a tear rolls down my cheek...
And a tear rolls down your cheek.
A tear?
Maybe I don't want to do that.
Maybe I don't want to cry.
Anything else you don’t want to do?
Tell me now, because maybe
I don't want you in the film.
Maybe I don't want to be in your little film.
Fine, then I'll start looking for someone else.
Gallo ciego.
Pugliese.
Where are you from?
London
And you know our tangos?
Why not?
You have to have lived... suffered... to understand our tangos.
Tell me...
Are you alone?
Is it true you're going to make a film about Tango?
With Pablo?
Dance studio?
Dance studio?
This is it!
I can rent you... this half.
Perfect, right?
What's going on?
Nothing.
You seem different.
We're working, remember?
You seem absent somehow.
Did you enjoy dancing last night? it won’t be possible.
Are you sure?
It's closed. Nobody’s here.
How about later?
I don't think so.
We'll wait.
And also,
I don't belong in France but I don't belong here either.
I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
Of being someone without roots.
I don't know where I come from nor where I'm going.
I'm afraid I'll disappear... without leaving a trace.
Perhaps that's why we met.
[ Man ]
It is so difficult to know where I should begin.
Especially when, unlike you,
I already know the ending.
But let us say that this story began with the end of another, far, far from the surf of Long Island.
For many years, I had absolutely no public life.
I had said, "No," to interviews so often, it was widely regarded as my forte.
Then, just once-- on impulse-- I said,
"Yes."
Does the 20th century play any part in your life?
I'm sorry?
Do you, for instance, use a word processor?
I'm a writer. I write.
I don't process words.
[ Interviewer ]
So, who do you write for?
Myself.
May I ask why you're here today?
Well, I was wondering that myself.
But... your... colleague was... a friend... of my late wife, who translated for the World Service.
And, of course, I do have a faint interest as to how these things are done, you know.
You've never been tempted to write for radio?
Or television?
I'm afraid not.
Would you permit your work to be adapted for the screen, now that even
E.M. Forster's been done?
Oh, I'd prefer not to be done.
[ Interviewer ]
But he's been done rather well, don't you think?
I've-- I've no idea.
I haven't been to the pictures for quite some time.
One or two?
One?
[ Man ]
Hey, are you sure this is the right window, man?
[ Man #2 ]
I-I don't know about this,
Corey. What if we get caught?
We're not gonna get caught, jerk-off!
And any minute now that room is gonna be filled with butt-naked babes.
[ Boys Laughing ] Hey, big guy, give me the camera.
[ Beeping Sound ]
Ahhh.
Oh, man!
Whoo-hoo!
Take it off, please!
She is so totally hot!
Someone's coming!
Christ, it's the Stomper!
Oh, I'm outta here!
What are you boys doing here?
You shouldn't be here!
This isn't E.M. Forster!
Hey, man, you got a rival.
Molly's in there with a guy!
What?
I'll kill him!
Come on.
Let's go!
Mikey?
You been beaten to it by your kid brother!
I think it's time for a pizza delivery, boys.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, wee.
Go get 'em, man!
Hoo-hoo!
Hey, what are you doin'?
[ Mikey ]
Hey, cut it out!
Go, dude, go!
Kick his ass!
Corey!
What's up?
Hey, come on, man.
We can talk about this.
Yeah?
[ Audience Laughing ]
Hiya, Molly.
What's happenin', baby?
[ Molly ]
Hi, Corey.
[ Mikey ]
Come on, man. Put me down! Put me down!
Corey, she made me do it.
Shut up, you little jerk-off!
You're just trying to make me jealous, huh?
Ah!
What a relief.
My wife must have known this would happen.
Tell me, Mrs. Reed, you live here alone now, don't you?
Yes.
Me alone.
But the... television.
The television?
It's mine. I like it.
You... watch the pictures?
[ Man On TV] Your specialized subject is Christopher Columbus.
You've two minutes starting now.
With subtitles.
By what name was
Columbus known in Spain?
Cristóbal Colón.
[ TVHost ]
Correct.
Of what did Columbus reputedly become the first European connoisseur?
Tobacco?
Correct.
How extraordinary.
Have you been locked out all day?
No! No, no. I--
Just for a short while.
I went to the pictures.
The cinema.
The ci-ne-ma.
I'm ever so sorry about yesterday.
And why is that?
About not being home when you needed the keys.
Well, I can hardly dictate what you do on your Sundays,
Mrs. Barker.
My sister in Whitstable's been poorly.
Needs a bit of helping out.
Is there anything else,
Mrs. Barker?
I was just going to mention--
My sister and I heard you on the wireless yesterday.
Tell me, you weren't taught by Forster when you were up at Cambridge?
Alas, no.
You know they're... even adapting his work for the pictures now?
Can't say that I approve.
It could have been a lot worse.
- Er, the adaptation?
- The interview.
Oh. In what way?
It could have been on television. That's a much... greater intrusion,
I can tell you.
Do you know you can get televisions that transcribe what people say?
May I ask, would that be another book?
Yes.
I'm afraid it is.
I don't know how you do it.
Takes me all my time to read one.
Well, as Gwen always used to say, it's easier to write one than it is to read one properly, Mrs. Barker.
[ Mutters ]
Yes,
I'm sure she did.
I can almost hear her saying it.
I've never really approved of the pre-Raphaelites.
Hmm?
Well, just look at him.
He's one of your sister's favorites.
What's meant to be going on?
Love letters, suicide-- that sort of thing?
More likely to be rejections from publishers.
Chatterton was a writer.
Oh.
I must get around to reading one of your books, Giles.
There never seem to be enough hours in the day.
Giles?
[ Thinking ]
Winsome, young, neoclassical.
Isolated... by beauty, death.
No smoking, guv.
Thanks very much.
- I beg your pardon?
- It says, "No smoking."
No. It says,
"Thank you for not smoking."
As I am smoking,
I don't expect to be thanked.
Can I help you?
Uh-- Yes--
- One for number three, please.
- Come again?
- Uh, one adult for number three.
- What do you want to see, sir?
- The film in number three.
- Which?
Uh, Hotpants College II.
Thank you.
[ People Murmuring ]
[ Students Chattering ]
The college girls are back!
Let's go!
Come on!
Hang on! All right?
Come on, Mom. I gotta go.
Today's a big day.
Oh, yeah? What's so special about it?
College girls are back in town, that's what.
Oh, I wish you'd keep your mind on school,
Corey, like your brother.
Yeah. Yeah.
He finds time to work at
Chicken Burger. Why can't you?
[ Mom Coughing ]
Mom, I thought you were going to see a doctor about that.
What a fucking prat.
Shhh!
[ Giles Thinking ]
Ronnie Bostock.

Uh, you wouldn't have any milk left, I suppose?
Mum. Milk.

Only this left.
Is okay?
It is milk, isn't it?
Abigail, we close now.
We're closing now.

I'm sorry to disturb you, but I can't find them anywhere.
Uh, Mrs. Barker,
I've been thinking that, uh, it will be best if I was left undisturbed in the afternoon.
My work is very taxing at the moment.
What about your tea?
Oh, I'll call you when
I'm ready for it. But, um--
I must admit it's been... odd this last week.
It's that funny milk.
Uh-uh, what is it you were looking for?
The kitchen scissors.

Mrs. Barker,
I'll take tea now!
Is it on the left?
Or right?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Imagined Quiz Master ]
And what is your chosen specialized subject?
[ Thinking ]
The life and work of Ronnie Bostock.
You have two minutes on the life and work of Ronnie Bostock, starting... now.
Ronnie Bostock was born in Southern California but where does he live now?
Chesterton, Long Island.
Correct. What is the name of the dog which features... prominently in his publicity stills?
Strider.
Correct.
What is Ronnie Bostock's... favorite reading material?
Stephen King and science fiction.
Correct.
For what does Ronnie have a self-confessed weakness?
Pizza?
Yes. I'll accept that.
It's actually pizza with extra anchovies.
Under what circumstances would Ronnie do a nude scene?
If it were tasteful...
And?
Correct. essential to the plot.
Why was he not cast in the original Hotpants College?
Uh, too young?
No. He was unable... to break his contract with the sitcom
Home Is Where The Heart Is.
What is Ronnie's favorite kind of training shoe and why?
Reeboks, because
British stuff is cool.
Correct.
With which of his rock idols was he recently photographed?
Axl Rose.
Correct. Ronnie claims to like nothing better than hanging out with the guys.
What exactly do these "guys" mean to him?
I wonder.
[ Giles ]
Is that Chesterton there?
Chesterton.
You want?
Why not?
[ Clears Throat ]
For a change, yes?
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.
I have, as usual, said you're far too busy.
But it is a very prestigious lecture,
Giles.
Would you advise me against it?
As your agent,
I would strongly urge you to do it. But... as a friend...
I wouldn't want to disturb your work, which seems to be so... invigorating, Giles.
I'll think about it.
Really?
Yes. I'm getting rather tired of hearing myself say no.
Now, you can help me, Henry.
What exactly is a "sitcom"?
No good, this program.
Really?
Here, this is better. Dog.
Do you like dogs,
Mr. De'Ath?
Need any help, sir?
Yes. I'm interested in acquiring a video player.
Uh, these are microwaves, sir.
Oh.
Video players are over here.
[ Salesperson ] Let's start with this little humdinger.
It's got it all, this one.
Nicam digital stereo, long-play facility,
1 4-day, eight-event timer, two-speed slow motion--
My needs are rather limited.
But it's top of the range, this one.
Oh, is it?
Yeah, and it's in your interest to keep up with the technology.
I'll get it, Mrs. Barker!
Delivery for Doctor Death.
Yes.
Is that your real name, then?
Pronounced "Day-aa-th."
Bet you get a lot ofjokes.
[ Mutters ]
Not since school.
Nice place.
All these books, they're not all different, are they?
- You read them all?
- Could we, uh--
Right.
Where's your telly?
- I'm sorry?
- Gogglebox. TV.
[ Chuckles ]
No. I don't have one.
Blimey! Well, what the hell's this for then?
Well, it's to watch films on, actually.
Yeah, but-- but what you gonna watch them on?
Well--
On the video?
Two pieces of identification, one proof of address--
I believe that qualifies me for membership.
There's a ten-pound deposit so you don't nick nothing, but you get a two-pound voucher for Bernie's Pizza delivery.
You can take out two tapes now if you want.
Um--
Could I forfeit my Bernie's Pizza voucher for a third one?
That's out.
I'm-- I'm sorry?
Tex Mex.
Went out an hour ago.
Really?
We only keep one of everything unless it's a big fuck off blockbuster.
I see.
That's in.
Harry-- Skid Marks.
No. Tape's buggered.
- Do you want to have another bash?
- Well, uh, uh--
Perhaps you have, uh,
Hotpants College II?
Harry! Hotpants I, II--
It's not out yet, is it?
Nah.
Got Hotpants I in.
Uh, may I place a reservation for Tex Mex?
No. There's no reservations.
Uh, you mean I have to wait two weeks, uh--
I hope not. You can only keep them out overnight.
Isn't one allowed two weeks at a library?
It takes two weeks to read a book, doesn't it?
Those things are more trouble than they're worth, if you ask me.
Uh, Mrs. Barker.
I've been thinking
I should be... starting to cope a little better on my own.
So, I won't be needing you after 2:00 in the afternoons.
But what about your dinner?
Oh, I'm quite sure that I can manage.
Oh, and I would... prefer it if you-- if you didn't clean in this room... at all.
What about the dust?
"The more one dusts, the more dust one makes," is what Gwen always used to say, Mrs. Barker.
This had better work.
Cool it, Pete. Have I ever let you down before?
Make sure you land him in the shit. 'Cause that's what he's done to us.
Hey, hey, hey.
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get down. Get down.
Now!
[ Rider Screaming ]
[ Horse Whinnies ]
Wow.
Awesome.
Oh, shit!
Too darn right, Bozo.
You're in deep shit.
Yeah, man.
You know what you are?
You're nothing but a-- but a skid mark on the underpants of life.
[ Ronnie, Pete Laugh ]
Yeah!
He's coming.
He's coming.
[ Ronnie ]
So, if you take the entrance and project study--
[ Boys Laughing ]
[ Giles ]
If one has to have a theme, Henry, it would be... the discovery of beauty where no one ever thought of looking for it.
Ah, yes. Familiar territory for you.
Hardly. I have begun to engage in completely new subject matter.
New to me, at least.
Splendid. At our time of life, it's good to tackle something new.
I was considering golf, actually.
I could almost say that it has brought me into contact with... everything that
I myself have never been.
But that must be all for the time being, Henry.
Giles,
I'm very intrigued.
You may find it rather difficult to get in touch with me in the near future.
I'm finding it rather difficult now, old chap.
Hey, Jake!
Hey, hey, what's goin'on? Are you crazy?
Get out of the way, Johnny.
This ain't the way, Jake.
You heard what
Father Bryson said.
He said we all gotta learn how to get along.
[Jake ] Yeah?
Well I'm tired of these Mexicans taking jobs from my folks!
[Johnny ] They never took any job you want and you know it!
Just get out of the way, Johnny.
I ain't going anywhere.
You want to get to these boys, you have to go through me.
[Jake ]
Is that right?
[Johnny ] Yeah, that's right.
Oh, you did it now, Jake!
[ Groans ]
Save your breath, my child.
Oh, I tried to tell him,
Father. I tried. I tried.
[ Father Bryson ]
Hush now. God knows what you say is true, to be sure.
You were right, Father.
[ Panting, Groaning ]
We all got to try to live together.
[Johnny ]
I'll never forget what you said.
[ Groans, Expires ]
Johnny?
No!
[ Father Bryson ]
I promise you won't die in vain, my child.
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
[ Thinking ]
Forgive me, Ronnie.
[ Giles ] For is it not the case that when we are in the habit of viewing a film... more than once, assisted by that technological aide-memoire the video player, then a remarkable phenomenon presents itself.
We see... that what, at first, appeared to be merely accidental or unrehearsed... becomes on subsequent viewings an indelible part of the film's texture.
A distant landscape, a blurred face in the crowd, even a banal message on a T-shirt.
So, the largely unrecognized art of film acting... depends entirely on the ability of the actor-- or, indeed, actress-- to make everything about himself-- uh, or herself-- seem equally permanent.
When, thus, an actor is called upon to smile, he must try to select a smile from a collection-- a repertoire-- a whole file of smiles, as it were.
Naive, rueful, sly, sarcastic... and so on.
Anyway, to return to my theme of "The Death of the Future--"
Don't you think you've been overdoing it, old chap?
We're not as young as we used to be, after all.
Maybe you should... take a break.
Go on a trip.
Do you the world of good.
A trip?
Yes. I-I know you think that traveling for its own sake is frivolous, but...
I must insist that you seriously consider it.
[ Phone Ringing ]

[ Answering Machine Message ]
This is Giles De'Ath speaking.
If your call is extremely urgent, you may leave a brief message after I finish speaking.
[ Beep ]
Good, Lord!
Giles? It's Henry.
You have an answer phone.
Whatever next?
[Jet Engine Roaring ]
[Jet Engine Roaring ]
But, um, isn't there a guest house or something of that nature?
Well, now, there's a motel.
Motel?
Yeah. On the expressway.
Oh, no. That would be out of the question.
The room is quiet?
We take a pride in the secluded nature of our accommodation.
How long will you be with us?
Uh, at least a week or two.
Are you touring
Long Island?
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
No. No, not really.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, a writer!
From London too.
Oh, my.
Well, we're charmed to have you, uh, Mister, uh--
De'Ath.
Well...
Mister, anything you want to know about Chesterton... you just ask me.
Hmmm.
[ Sighs ]
Oh--
Good Lord!
[ Patrons Chattering,
Utensils Clattering ]
You're lookin' very spiffy today.
Sir?
You're looking very spiffy today.
Very attractive.
Oh, thank you.
Has Lou taken your order yet?
I-I must admit I'm... having a little difficulty understanding the menu.
Get him a cup of coffee.
[ Giles ]
What would you recommend?
Oh, we do a great cheeseburger.
Oh, I think not.
The best hash browns you ever tasted?
[ Chuckles ]
That rather goes without saying.
There you are.
Thank you.
So... you're from England, huh?
Yes.
You ever bumped into a fellow by the name of Stan Brighouse?
I believe not.
An attractive man, average-sized hands.
But he had breasts... like a woman.
Very odd.
He was a nice person, though.
You should look him up.
Anyway, I'm Irv, by the way.
Hence, "Chez d'Irv."
You got it.
Irving Buckmuller at your service.
This area here... is very attractive.
This is where a person like you should be staying.
It's secluded?
Oh, you'll love it.
Yeah.
Where the odd celebrity might hide out, no doubt.
Exactly. Exactly.
And you know what?
They all know Irv's.
Everyone of'em knows Irv's. Right, Lou?
How you doin'?
Good morning.
- Hey, that's a great tie.
- Thank you.

[ Louder Moaning

Yes. Mrs. Abbott, is there any possibility of your more, uh, short-term guests not having rooms next to mine?
Well, yes, I do appreciate that, but I also value my own privacy.
[ Rumbling, Whimpering ]
Yes, indeed.
It is interrupting my work.
Over here you ask for the cheque and pay with a bill.
Over here you ask for the cheque and pay with a bill.
In England, you ask for a bill and pay with a cheque.
Hmm. Is that the truth?
[ Chuckles ]
Yes.
No shit!
[ Laughs ]
A writer here, from London, England.
Likes words.
[ Women Chattering ]
Aha!
How you doin' today?
Oh, uh, very well, thank you.
You live around here?
No, no. Well, not yet, at least.
I'm-- I'm, uh... looking at property for sale.
You're movin' to Chesterton?
Well, it's a poss--
[ Car Passing ]
Great wheels, huh?
[ Mumbles ]
Yes.
You know, you'd cover a lot more ground in a car.
Yes. I suppose I would.
Uh-uh, may I go on my way?
Sure. We just like to know what strangers are up to, that's all.
[ Chuckles ]
You take care, now.
[ Mutters ]
Yeah.
[ Electronic Chirp ]

You are standing... too close to this vehicle!
Please move away immediately!

Hello?
Ah, Mrs. Abbott.
Yes. A typewriter seems to have appeared in my room.
Oh. How very thoughtful of you.
Cocktails?
No. I'm afraid not. I have to be up at the crack of dawn.
Good morning!
Hey, how you doin'?
What happened to your foot?
Oh, less torture.
You take it easy now.
Hey, Strider.
You go home now.
Strider.
[ Panting ]
[ Whimpering ]
Strider?
[ Dog Barks,

I had one once called "Tiffy."
"Tiffy"? What kind of a--
What is that? Wha--
What's that, a pansy name?
Come on! Tiffy lived to be 1 5.
We're not talking about how long the dog lived.
Caesar.
We're talking about names.
There are a lot of Caesars around.
What about "Spot"?
Spot! That's the name that everybody calls a dog-- Spot.
What if the dog has no spots?
They all got spots.
No. Sometimes they got patches.
And there's a difference between a patch and a spot.
Then they call it
"Patch" or "Patchy."
Or "Patch"-- "Patches."
If he's got stripes, they call it "Stripey."
That's stupid.
Or "Stripes."
Come on.
Why?
Do you want a dog, Giles?
I can get you puppies for free.
No, no, no, no, no.
I just heard some rather strange names, that's all.
Uh, is Strider common?
Rider?
Striper?
Strider?
Strider.
Striper?
Strider?
Strider.
I never heard of it.
Strider?
I never of it.
Oh, sure. Strider, Caesar.
[ Scoffs ] They're all a damned nuisance.
You never knew Tiffy.
[ Clattering ]
[ Woman ]
Strider?
Strider!
[ Dog Growling ]
What is it, boy?
It's just a squirrel, you idiot. Come on. In.
I can't take you to the supermarket. Jesus.
[ Car Door Slams,

Oh!
I am most dreadfully sorry.
I do hope nothing is broken.
I guess not.
We just don't have things this size in England.
Rather tricky to control.
It's okay.
Take it easy.
Oh, haven't-- haven't we met?
[ Sighs ]
I don't think so.
Ah, no. I've seen your photograph.
Are you a film star?
Would you mind just leaving me alone?
Oh, no, of course! You're engaged to Abigail's idol.
I could really do without this.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Uh, my godchild, Abigail, has a huge crush on this very young... and, uh, uh, promising
American actor and his name is Ronnie--
Is it, no. Ronnie--
Ronnie Bostock, isn't it?
You made a very handsome couple.
[ Woman ]
What kind of books do you write?
Oh, I'm hardly a household name over here.
Are you working on one now?
Well, if I'm inspired by the soothing rustle of the Long Island surf, as your
Walt Whitman put it.
I hope you have a great time.
Are you over for long?
Excuse me?
From Hollywood.
Oh, we live here.
Oh, really?
Ron's in L.A. right now.
I just can't believe he's so big in England.
- I never knew that.
- [ Chuckles ]
It's extremely kind of you.
This isn't
Manhattan.
You can't just hail a cab.
Indeed.
You've got a lot of groceries for someone staying at a motel.
Yes. I've-- I've always been rather vague about domestic arrangements, but I wanted to find out how Americans shop, what you eat and so on.
Actually, I can heartily recommend the cheeseburgers at Chez d'Irv.
[ Groans ]
God, you've been to that dive?
Well, perhaps you can recommend somewhere superior.
There are some great seafood places up the coast, but you gotta drive there.
Well, allow me to take you out for a spot of lunch.
Oh, I couldn't, really.
To thank you for your kindness.
Uh, I don't think so.
[ Seagulls Squawking ]
Very impressive. You're both very talented, my dear.
[ Chuckles ] Thanks.
Well, you must give
Ronnie tips, no doubt.
Tips?
Well, doesn't he have to do photographs for the fan magazines?
Oh, photo shoots. Tell me about it. He hates them.
Oh, seems rather good at it.
Oh, sure. It just--
He thinks you can't be a teen idol if you're gonna be a serious actor.
Oh, does he?
It's crazy. I mean, most of the actors I know wait tables.
Why would they do that?
I can't wait to tell him I've met a famous British writer... who thinks he's got the look of a young Olivier, was it?
Uh, a little.
[ Chuckles ]
I should be writing this down.
Hey, maybe you could do a script for him or something.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I don't exactly write for the youth market, Audrey.
Oh, well, that's great. He's so sick of playing dumb kids.
Oh--
[ Phone Ringing ]
It's okay, the machine's on.
[ Audrey's Voice ] Hi, we're not home. Leave a message.
[ Man's Voice ]
Hey, babe. Honey?
Uh, I guess you're out... again. [ Chuckles ]
It's Ron.
[ Ronnie ]
You better not be having a good time without me.
[ Ronnie ]
Things are pretty cool here.
I'll talk to you later. Love you.
[ Audrey ] I'll call him later.
Oh, Giles, I forgot.
[ Machine Beeps ]
You can smoke here if you want. We don't, but--
Giles? Are you okay?
Dear God, this is ridiculous!
[ Chuckles ]
[ Audrey ]
It's incredible.
He's seen all your work.
And he says that you're really big in England!
You'd just love him.
He's so British, you wouldn't believe it.
[ Laughs ]
Screw you! He's old enough to be my father.
So, Ronnie will be back soon?
Uh-huh.
Do give him my regards.
Sure.
Tell him that I will be following his career with great interest.
Maybe you should tell him.
I'd like him to meet you.
I guess you're busy, though, with your writing?
Well, yes, I am, but--
Oh, I don't know.
We're really busy too.
And he can get kind of shy. I don't know, maybe he'll call you.
[ Man On Radio ]
Now get only a--
[ Radio Ceases ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Birds Chirping ]
[ Door Closes ]
[ Typewriter Keys Clacking ]
[ Beeping On TV]
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Ringing Continues ]
[ Bird Squawking ]
So, Giles, he may not show it, right, but he really wants to hear what you told me... about his potential.
Oh, really?
Really.
He's been kind of low since he got back.
If you could find some way of telling him what you think of him, well, I'd really appreciate it.
[ Ronnie ]
Well, what do you know?
It was the cops.
They're keepin' an eye on the place.
One of the neighbors saw some weirdo hangin' around.
[ Audrey ]
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.
Are you guys comin'in or what?
Come on, Strider.
[ Audrey ]
It's nothing really, Giles.
Shakespeare?
Oh, yes, his plays are full of it.
Well, wait a minute.
Are you saying that if
Shakespeare was alive today, he'd be doin' things like Hotpants College?
All I'm saying, Ronnie, is that Shakespeare used bawdy humor to please the mob in the pit.
I never knew that.
Yes, and, of course, he was able to elevate his material... beyond such limitations... as have you.
I'm not talking about good acting as if it were, say, merely good cooking.
Oh, by the way, the teriyaki was delicious, Audrey.
Thanks.
I'm talking about a type of acting that is purely instinctive.
You see, Ronnie, you have something that gives even the most casual look or gesture... a real intensity.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.
It came as no surprise to me when I heard that you'd been rescued at an early age... from the hell of advertising.
It was obvious to me that some producer, some astute producer, had seen what I saw when Abigail persuaded me to see Hotpants College II.
I got that role because
I looked like the guy who played Mikey in the original.
Yes, but didn't you completely reinvent the character with a mere string of lines?
Didn't you make Mikey the focus of the entire story?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
As for your fate in the pizza parlor, the plastic tomato and all that, well--
[ Laughs ]
Well, I don't know.
This may sound absurd, but--
No, my point of reference would be Wallis' painting... of the tragic young writer
Chatterton... that hangs in the Tate Gallery.
[ Audrey Sighs ]
I'd really like to see that.
But, Giles, we've seen
Hotpants in theaters with kids.
They don't get any of that.
- Of course not.
- But it's made for them.
But they're the rabble in the pit.
[ Audrey Laughs ]
We saw Hotpants at this drive-in used to be here.
Ron kept his sunglasses on the whole time.
Giles, did you ever see Tex Mex?
Oh, I did indeed, more than once.
Really killed me when that one bombed.
Ah, yes, I'm afraid it suffered the same fate in Europe.
I really believed in that project.
It had-- had a real message.
Yes, it was a great shame really.
In Europe, we have a much stronger tradition of work... with what you call a message.
That is, after all, why I've been persuaded to write my first screenplay.
Yes, if Tex Mex had been, say,
German about the plight of the exploited Gastarbeiters, it would have met with a far greater success.
They have Mexicans in Germany?
It probably would have made less money than Hotpants, but in Europe we're not necessarily interested in that kind of a success, not when a film can change the way people think.
And that, Ronnie, is why I write.
It's also why you act, although you may not yet know it.
[ Whirring ]
[ Ronnie ]
You married or somethin'?
I was. My wife died unexpectedly sometime ago.
Sorry to hear that.
Got any kids?
No, no, my wife was rather older than myself.
Oh, like me and Aud.
Yes, indeed.
So what's this script about?
Script?
Yeah, you said you were working on a screenplay.
Oh, yes, that.
Oh, I couldn't subject you to work in progress.
Why not?
Then, of course, there is the risk of copyright infringement.
[ Laughs ]
Giles, we're old friends, huh?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Ronnie ]
Coffee always takes her forever.
[ Giles ] Indeed.
Hey, Strider.
So what's it about?
Well, it concerns a young man, Ronnie, about your age,
I suppose.
He's a deaf-mute... brought up in complete isolation.
His only human contact is through the television.
So he has been subjected to rather excessive... and unrealistic types of behavior.
He never speaks?
Oh, he cannot speak.
Wow.
Oh, yes, I'm determined that the audience share his subjective state... rather than merely pity him because, well, that would be awful.
Yeah, yeah.
So what happens?
Understandably enough, he yearns to enter the real world.
So he surrenders himself to the most irrational desire... known to mankind.
Maybe you can guess what that is?
[ Steam Hissing In Kitchen ]
It is the desire to fall in love, Ronnie.
And since he's been exposed to such a thing on the television every day, it becomes his quest, so to speak.
And every tale, whether it be Richard The Third... or Hotpants College The Third, centers upon a quest.
And as in my other work, it will inevitably end with a sacrifice.
The French, in particular, seem to like such a thing.
However, I suspect it is not one for the drive-ins.
Oh, thank you, my dear.
Decaf au lait, no doubt?
Uh-huh.
Thanks, babe.
It's brilliant, man.
Oh, I don't think so, not yet. Please.
No, it is.
I've never heard a story line like that.
I'm totally blown away.
That's very kind of you.
- It's kind of artsy, I guess.
- Oh, dear. Is that bad?
No, no, that's good.
Have you seen Birdy?
Birdy?
Birdy, yeah, it's an Alan Parker film.
I met him once.
He's from England too.
Ah.
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Beeps, Whirs ]
That's just a fax.
Probably more rewrites.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
You can smoke, Giles.
[ Laughs ]
You smoke?
[ Groans ]
Bad habit.
Oh, yes, I know.
We'd never have met if he didn't.
Really?
Why is that?
Giles chose to stay in Chesterton because he smokes Chestertons.
Cool.
Giles?
You know what you were saying about being a writer... and wanting new experiences and all?
I don't know.
Maybe it's not such a good idea.
Come on. Tell us, babe.
Well, I was just thinking.
I have a shoot in the city tomorrow... and I just thought maybe you'd like to come.
They're so boring.
Not necessarily.
Not if you haven't been on one.
I'm not comin'.
I'm not inviting you.
They're totally boring.
Wouldn't I be in the way?
I'd love you to come.
I'm sure you'd get some great ideas.
I got a better idea.
Why don't I show you the Hamptons?
You don't like the Hamptons.
I do off-season.
What do ya say?
It's such a choice.
One couldn't do both?
No way.
Okay, I'll tell you what.
If the weather's okay, we'll go to the coast.
If it's rainy, you go into the city with the supermodel here.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, that does sound fair.
Okay, babe?
[ Man ]
LaRue digs it out in the corner--
So things look good for Washington and Baltimore tomorrow.
It's a different story in New York. Look at those clouds gobbling up Manhattan.
They're sure to bring rain tomorrow and plenty of it.
Over in Long Island, it's gonna be even worse with both coasts pulling in that low pressure.
[ Traffic Passing ]
[ Laughing ]
Can we have your autograph?
Here. Try these on.
[ Indistinct ]
Oh, no, no, no.
Go ahead. Put 'em on.
It's bright out there.
Very nice.
Very nice indeed.
[ Giles ]
"Hey, dude, how's it hanging?"
[ Ronnie ]
"It's cool."
"Hey, man, I'm real sorry about your mother.
Life's a bitch, huh?"
"Yeah, I guess.
You know somethin', Brad?
I wish I could have made things easier for her."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah.
"It seemed like she was always workin' and stuff.
Never really got a chance to know her."
"Hey, man, don't grief out on me."
"Sorry, man.
Just feelin' a bit lonesome, you know?"
"Hey, you're a college boy now.
All those babes don't want to see you lonesome."
"Sure, like
I'm Mr. Popular."
"Well, I'm going to make you
Mr. Popular, and that's a promise."
Mmm!
A poignant little scene.
It sets up the whole story line.
I go to college.
All the college girls try to mother me.
But I fall in love with a teacher whose husband turns out to be a grand wizard in the KKK.
Uh, something of a message there?
It's the usual stuff.
Tell me, do you get a chance to deliver a eulogy to your mother?
No, no, no way.
It would hold up the action.
- You're allowed to improvise?
- Thanks, babe.
They get pretty nervous about that.
Hmph.
What's the point?
Where you been hidin'yourself?
I was talking to our neighbor. Is that okay?
Is this one of those telephones that doesn't have to be plugged in?
Quite remarkable, isn't it?
Hey, I have a great idea.
Giles, why don't you call your godchild in England?
I'm sorry?
Abigail, wasn't it?
You could call her and tell her you're sitting here with Ronnie Bostock.
Ron could say hi to her.
I know she'd just die.
Well, I'm afraid--
I'm afraid it's the middle of the night in England.
They're only five hours ahead.
You know what, Aud?
That's about the stupidest idea
I ever heard. What am I supposed to say to the kid?
Huh? I'm sorry,
Giles.
Oh.
Jesus!

"End of brackets.
"I'd like to say a few words by Walt Whitman, if that's okay with everyone."

Now, voyager, sail thou forth to seek and find."
[ Chuckling ]
[ Man ]
Let's go. Bring him home.
Bring him home.
I suspect you're going to have to explain the rules to me.
Okay, you gotta hit the ball and run around the bases to home.
Hence, baseball.
Hmm, rather like circular cricket.
I guess.
[ Applause, Cheering ]
Is there something wrong, Audrey?
We're going to see my folks tomorrow up in Vermont.
Vermont?
For a week.
For a week?
Before Ron has to go back.
That's a strike, Giles.
To, uh, Los Angeles?
Right.
Ronnie never mentioned this.
He doesn't know yet.
You understand that we still have a lot of work to do on the script.
That's too bad.
I guess he'll get by.
[ Umpire ]
Strike!
That's a strike, too, Giles.
Audrey, surely it is as clear to you as it is to me... that he deserves a great deal more than "getting by."
He'll do it this time.
He never gets struck out.
Watch this, Giles.
It's gonna be a good one.
The bases are loaded.
You realize this is... a very crucial moment in his life.
God, you're good.
-[ Man ] All right!
-[ Bat Hits Ball ]
[ Applause, Cheering ]
That's a home run, Giles.
Ronnie.
So... this is your last day in Long Island.
Or, should one say, on Long Island?
Yeah, Aud's gettin' kind of itchy, so--
I'm also leaving
Long Island soon.
Really?
We should hook up in Europe sometime.
I'd like that.
Ronnie, I'd like that very much.
Of course, you must honor your obligations to Audrey.
It strikes me that you're very young to be making such a commitment, especially with your career at this crucial stage.
Yeah, well, a guy's got to know when he's on to a good thing, right?
It was like that for you, wasn't it?
Uh, well,
I suppose so, yes.
It's a birthmark.
They cover it up for shooting, but I like it.
You know, I always thought it was on the right.
How do you mean?
Ronnie, I have a confession to make to you.
I've been waiting for you for quite some time.
Oh, shit, Giles, I'm sorry.
I had to drop Aud--
Several years, in fact.
What?
Ronnie, there is nothing more solitary than an artist's life.
No doubt you'll find that out for yourself.
Painfully, perhaps.
One yearns for solace without quite knowing where to look for it.
But I found it in you.
Oh--
That's great.
Ronnie, I have another confession to make.
I brought you here not to say good-bye, but to make you an offer.
An offer?
I am prepared to devote myself to your career.
Wow, Giles, I, uh--
[ Clears Throat ]
I'm honored.
I don't know what to say.
You got to come out west.
We can start to work on something.
No, Ronnie, forget Los Angeles.
Put it behind you.
Your future lies in Europe.
Giles, I gotta take things one step at a time.
Aud would love to go back to Europe and do more work.
It would be cool to spend time there--
"Cool"?
I'm talking about a turning point in your life.
But I've got no contacts there.
People know me here.
As what?
Ronnie, as what?
Look, um, we'll keep in touch, huh?
Listen to me, Ronnie.
In Europe, it is often the case that a-- a young man benefits from the-- the wisdom and the experience of an elder.
Why, there's almost a tradition of such friendships.
Cocteau and Radiguet.
Uh, Verlaine, Rimbaud.
Rambo?
Arthur Rimbaud,
French poet.
He--
He was Paul Verlaine's lover.
Look, Giles, uh,
I really gotta go.
I gotta pick up Aud.
I don't want her to be--
Now, listen.
I understand your misgivings, and I respect the fact that your immediate plans... are founded on these temporary attachments.
"Temporary attachments"?
Well, Ronnie, your relationship with Audrey... is hardly likely to last forever.
And why is that?
Well, it-- I'm afraid it's obvious to me.
What exactly are you tryin' to say, Giles?
[ Whispers ]
Ronnie, please.
Look, Giles.
I would like to believe all the things you said about my career, but you got things all wrong.
Ronnie.
Ronnie, listen to me.
You don't understand.
Giles, I think
I do understand, and I have to go now.
How can you act like this... when you know--
You must know how completely, how desperately...
I love you.
[ Door Bell Dings ]
Dear God, what have I done?
[ Man ]
Back where he should be in the lineup tonight.
His batting average is .395, just what it should be.
Now the question is, how many hits is he gonna get tonight?
How ya doin'?
I wonder if you could do me a great favor and add this to your deliveries?
I don't know if I can do that, sir.
It's a federal offense.
Surely--
I'm sorry, sir.
[ Engine Starts ]
[ Phone Rings, Fax Beeps ]
[ Giles ]
My dear Ronnie, it is so difficult to know... where I should begin, especially when, unlike you,
I already know the ending.
But let us say that this story began with the end of another, far, far from the surf of Long Island.
Tell me, when one sends a fax, uh, is it possible for it to be reversed?
How do you mean, sir?
Well, can it be got back?
I don't know about that.
I imagine not.
You wanna turn back?
Oh, I think it's rather late for that.
You sure?
Quite sure, thank you.
Hey!
[ Giles ]
Well, Ronnie, there it is, the end of our story.
And also the beginning of a new story for me, but perhaps you've worked that out for yourself.
But what of you, my darling?
For no one on Earth knows you better than I do.
And if you've read thus far,
I know you'll never bring yourself to destroy this letter... nor will you ever show it to anyone else.
And it will gradually dawn on you that your life might have taken a very different course... had you simply been able to open your heart to another.
And you'll often return to this letter.
You'll read it again and again in the years to come... until you no longer have to read what you'll know by heart.
And you'll cherish it as a source of pride... in the face of an uncaring world.
I'd like to say a few words by Walt Whitman, if that's okay with everyone.
"Now finale to the shore.
"Now land and life, finale and farewell.
"The untold want by life and land never granted.
"Now, voyager, sail thou forth... to seek and find."
This isn't make-believe.
- It really happened.
- Come off it!
Okay, leave that.
Were going to record.

Goodness!
What have they done?
- Isn't that the Lopez's house?
- Yes.
- Look at the state of it!
- You can imagine, auntie.
- What's become of them?
- They were among the first to go.
Really?
Of course.
- What about your husband?
- Adolfo?
You know how he loves Havana.
He's at one of his meetings.
Please, friends, please.
We're making this issue more complicated than it really is.
Justifiably so!
No. I've got to get back to
Camagüey as soon as possible.
This is a clear-cut issue.
If a man dies in Baracoa, he should be buried there.
After all, it's one and the same country.
Look here, Rivero, if I die in Baracoa, no way is anyone going to force me to be buried there.
I'm from Santa Clara, and all my family and friends live there.
Take it easy, friends, cool down.
Exuse me, Benito.
Look here, Rivero,
I agree with Paula.
It's not my fault if
I die in Baracoa.
- I might just be visiting friends.
- Who asked you, anyway?
Friends, don't all speak at once!
Go ahead, Adolfo...
What if... we share the body out among all of us?
Be more specific.
If each provincial company assumes responsibility for its own territory, if we each agree to transport the body across our province, then we all have less to do.
In which case no one will exceed the petrol allowance granted to each undertaker.
Look, Justo, if we carry out a careful, on-the-spot study, adhering to the proper procedures, the plan has to work.
- I totally reject such a wild idea.
- Me too.
It's okay for you, because you're from Guantánamo and there are no other towns in this direction.
But I'm from Santa Clara, smack in the middle of the island.
Every corpse on the island will be stopping off there.
I'm no stepping stone,
Adolfo!
Friends, it's no good just considering our own problems.
We're losing the overall view of the matter.
We have to think patriotically.
This isn't a local tavern.
They may have given
Adolfo the boot but he still seems to be well-connected.
What's the alternative, auntie?
You have to survive somehow.
Are you still unoccupied, Gina?
You've not gone back to teaching?
Back to teaching?
With all the trouble I had at the University?
Here theory and practice are two different things. I'm not going through all that again.
Yes, but there are otherjobs.
You can't stay shut up in the house.
What happened about that radio programme you mentioned?
A youth guidance programme on the radio?
Now?
You've no idea what a problem that would be.
Auntie, you're not going to smoke?
After the lunch we've just had!
Do you want one?
No, besides Adolfo doesn't like me smoking.
But Adolfo is in Havana, my dear!
What became of...?
He always asks after you.
Do you still think about him?
We'll probably bump into him.
I don't know why you're so worked up.
It's been fifty years,
Gina, fifty years.
A lot of things have changed. I don't want him to see me like this.
- Like what, Auntie?
- Come off it, Gina. Like this.
I was seventeen when he last saw me.
He's no eighteen-year-old now, either.
Georgina
Travieso!
Reglita Campoamor!
Hello, Gina.
Small world, isn't it?
Guantánamo is, you mean.
You haven't changed a bit.
Come on in, both of you.
What's new in Havana?
Come in.
Tell me about yourself.
Did you ever get married?
So long ago I hardly remember.
My roots are in this town.
Why, I've never even been to Santiago de Cuba.
You're joking!
- Have you any children?
- Two. A girl and a boy.
- I'd love to meet them.
- Pop round and visit.
It suits you to a T. I'm going to buy you it.
No, Auntie. I never go out anywhere.
Besides, Adolfo doesn't like such low necklines.
CULTURE IS IMMORTAL.
Citizens of Guantámano!
For fifty years, during which her art has been acclaimed in theatres the world over,
Georgina Travieso was not just Georgina Travieso.
For many she was
Cecilia Valdés, or Madame Butterfly, or María la O or Luisa Fernanda...
Look how young you were up on the bandstand!
A mere stripling.
I feel like a naughty girl.
Gina must be looking for me all over.
And that gossip Regla will have a field day tomorrow.
What about this young girl?
I'm sure I've seen her recently.
I can't imagine who it could be.
I must be going a bit soft in the head.
I don't think you were ever quite right in the head.
How young we were then!
Do you know I still have your blue ribbon?
My blue ribbon?
You've forgotten!
Don't you remember, when you left, you promised me you'd return and you gave me your blue hair ribbon as a token?
Now I remember.
You came to see me off.
It was raining buckets...
No, Cándido, it wasn't raining.
I remember it was a gorgeous day.
Yes it was raining.
I've never since seen a sun as beautiful as that morning.
It was so cloudy
I couldn't tell when night fell.
Nightfall?
But it was midday, Cándido.
It was night, I tell you, night.
How could it be night when the train left at 1 p.m.?
Here it is!
I'm like the white swan
which dies singing.
How young we were then!
When I get sentimental, do you know what I do?
I close my eyes and imagine things.
We're by a river bank,
I'm twenty, and you're sixteen.
You look handsome in your blue suit.
Now you're getting the hem of your dress wet in the river.
- Oh, the water's cold!
- You're about to fall and I...
What are you doing?
Mother will see us!
I love you.
I've loved you these fifty years.
Don't open your eyes.
Imagine that not a single day has gone by.
I want us to be together until the end.
When I saw you again,
I almost ran away.
I don't know,
I was scared.
And I felt pain, here, in my jaw.
But now everything is going to be different.
We'll never part again.
Isn't that so?
Yoyita!
... that dies singing...
... dies singing... dies singing...
Adolfo!
What? Yes, this has to run like clockwork... what's up?
Listen, your wife's calling.
My wife?
She says it's urgent.
Excuse me.
Hello, Gina.
What's wrong?
What?
That's impossible.
Can nothing be done?
Yes, darling. I'll leave for the airport right now.
Listen, leave everything to me.
Don't you do anything, do you hear?
Yes, listen, speak to Felo, to Felo.
Tell him to get busy with the formalities.
But don't you do anything.
You take it easy, my love.
Do you hear? Yes...
Aunt Yoyita!
Power cuts here as well?
The route is quite clear, Tony.
We bypass Santiago, go straight to Bayamo, and then on to Las Tunas.
I'll tell you the other stops on the way.
Guantánamo, Bayamo,
Las Tunas.
Okay.
We'll follow the hearse in your "Volga".
The corpse ahead and the uproar behind.
Okay.
Adolfo, Cándido wants to ask you a favour.
Go ahead, Cándido.
Listen, Adolfo, I've got no one left in the world...
He wondered if he could accompany
Aunt Yoyita to Havana with us.
Of course, Cándido.
You're like one of the family.
I'd already allowed for such a contingency and requested a permit for four people.
One moment...
Let's get this ready.
It's all right, it's all right like that.
Right, Adolfo...
Make sure you call Tirso.
Give him the exact departure time.
SOCIALISM OR DEATH.
Cándido is upset
because he has lost
his beloved.
The woman he longed for
has been taken from him
for the second time.
The funeral committee
leaves behind,
the East
and rolls westward
to accomplish its mission.
Guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera,
guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera...
Puchi, are you romantic?
You bet your balls!
Come on, baby, off you go, I'm in a hurry.
You're acting strange.
You've been acting very strange with me just lately. What's up?
Nothing. I've got to go.
Why?
You promised you'd take me to Havana this time.
It's just that this trip came up unexpectedly.
You already told me that one.
I'm too old for stories.
I've bet all my aces on you.
Look at the time!
I can't go back home now.
- Well, Marilis, that's how it is.
- What do I get out of it? Nothing!
You've used me and now you've got to take me to Havana.
Mariano,
I'm pregnant.
And my husband won't have a baby that's not his.
Is that clear?
He won't stand for it.
Shit, Marilis!
Listen, don't get all worked up. Calm down!
Bloody well calm down.
It's you that's got me into trouble.
Wait, we're going to talk things through.
- I promised to take you to Havana.
- Yes.
Okay, calm down. I'll take you.
We'll sort things out somehow.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Yes.
Wait for me here then. I'll get my things and be back in a flash.
And we'll set off for Havana.
That looks good!
Ramón!
Listen, Ramón!
Lets go.
- Get your stuff, we're off.
- Why? Look at the time.
Come on, mate.
- I'm in real trouble.
- What sort of trouble?
- Have you run somebody over?
- No! I'll explain on the way.
It's over Marilis. All his problems are over women.
- Oh no! Leave me out of it.
- That Marilis has gone crazy.
- I don't believe it...
- Come on, I'll explain on the way.
Come here. Lets load this rice.
O for the day when
I don't have to run off...
Tell her I'm not here.
- Marilis, what a coincidence!
- What a coincidence!
We were just talking about you.
- Just now.
- What kind of coincidence?
Where's Mariano?
He'll be back shortly.
He went to cut a bunch of bananas to take to Havana.
He'd do better to cut some flowers for his funeral because when I catch him,
I'll murder him. No man
- stands me up.
- Mariano was just saying
- we should pick you up.
- Stop protecting him.
You men are all the same.
- Leave Ramón out of it!
- He's another prime example.
You're the slut! You've been laid by all the men in La Maya.
Sour grapes, because you're fat and undesirable. I'm going in.
Over my dead body!
I won't have whores in my house.
How much?
The garlic? A buck or sixty pesos.
A buck, boss.
Interested?
Music Man?
A buck or sixty pesos.
That's half my wage.
- How many have you got?
- Six.
Give me all six.
Here.
They'll cry out for this in Havana.
Make a bit of room.
Hey! Have you got any food?
Food?
Only cigarettes and tobacco.
The 1,650 acres of beans
planted
in the state co-operative
and rural sectors
represent a new
record figure...
You undertakers shouldn't overdo things.
There aren't enough coffins.
... reached 28,
smashing the previous
record of 528 acres
in the winter harvest.
So a new record has been
set in local agriculture.
This is going to be a real success.
Now I'll make a name for myself.
... decisive result in the national
development plan...
Hey, listen, mate.
You're an expert in this witchcraft stuff.
Can't you magic away my problem with women?
You can't solve that with spells, Mariano.
It's simpler than that.
But I'm sick of teaching a reluctant learner.
The fancy women that you always go for think they have rights, and so make demands:
You can't have other women, you have to marry her, and take her to Havana.
We don't need that hassle, mate.
Just imagine if we had those problems in every town we visited.
Take me, I've no problems with my old lady.
But not you.
You have to go for the classy ones.
And to boot, you always have one up your sleeve.
Make your mind up.
Marry one, take her to Havana, be a good husband, do right by her, she's the one who should be first class.
But on the road, a bit on the side never did any harm.
On the road, well, on the road anything goes, plump or skinny.
I've got my old lady in Havana and I keep her warm and happy.
She's the one who'll look after me when I'm old.
That's life, Mariano.
Look what happened to old Manuel.
When he got a bit past it, all those women he had in tow couldn't be seen for dust.
Only someone who really loves you puts up with you when you're old.
No one went to his wake.
They sent his body to the medical school for dissection.
That's the worst thing:
Knowing you're going to die alone, with nobody at your side to close your eyes.
Come on, stop dramatizing!
Do me a favour.
I'm stuck here with the family.
Can you give us a lift?
- Where are you going?
- To Las Tunas.
- Three hundred pesos?
- Whatever you say, friend.
I just want to get out of here.
Up you go, be quick! When
I'm loaded up, this is risky.
Let's hurry!
Get a move on there!
Miss...
- Can you let us jump the queue?
- Sorry, I can't.
Look, we've got a corpse to take to Havana.
Yes, love, I appreciate your problem, but all we've got here is tamarind juice.
- Fine, I'll take five.
- I'm sorry, love, but until the ice arrives,
I can't start selling.
Order two coffees,
I'm going to the toilet.
Two coffees, pal.
I could do with a little water.
The manager, please.
Thanks.
Sorry!
Professor!
Mariano.
- Are you working here?
- No.
Well, yes. That's where I work.
- Didn't you finish University?
- Yes, I did.
I became an engineer.
Well?
You can imagine.
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
It's not too hard.
I even earn more.
Good.
- Are you just out for a drive?
- No.
No. We're taking my aunt, to Havana to be buried.
I'm sorry.
You gave up teaching.
No, it's just that we went back to Guantánamo.
But this is a government emergency.
Look, here's the service order.
I'm sorry, young man, but we only take dollars here.
Perhaps further on they can help you.
- Come on.
- Right.
I behaved like a kid.
The last time I saw her,
I slipped a note inside her book, and then I never saw her again.
I never went back to the University.
That must have been... three years ago.
She remembered my name.
Sounds like one of those
TV soap operas.
Don't take offence, mate, but it's true.
I was mad about that woman.
She was your teacher, then?
- What subject?
- Economics.
So she knows how to get out of this mess, right?
Socialist political economics was what she taught me.
But don't get the idea she was dogmatic. Quite the opposite.
Her classes were...
Besides, what she said made you think.
She got into real trouble for it.
Because there was another teacher there who really was obsessive.
She taught scientific communism.
- What?
- Just imagine.
Explain.
Well, she talked about what paradise would be like.
The land of plenty.
Good grief!
Now I believe they call it scientific socialism.
Any day now they'll be calling it scientific capitalism.
That's a good one!
How far are you going, pal?
Bayamo and then Las Tunas.
I have to pick up some goods.
All aboard for Las Tunas!
- Look, nice and ripe.
- How much?
- Only fifty per kilo.
- I'll take a bunch.
No, the price is in dollars.
Fifty bucks a kilo, boss.
Give me some.
There you are.
Thanks.
Have one, Georgina.
- Music Man.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
Your change, friend.
Thank you very much.
Here, Adolfo.
Tony!
Tony!
Would you mind very much turning off the radio?
- Okay, Music Man, sorry.
- Just a minute, Tony.
I only asked if he'd mind turning the music off.
I don't think it's the best moment for celebrating.
Well, I'll be...!
Give 'em an inch and they take a mile.
Adolfo, please!
Okay, Cándido, okay.
I only had the radio on to hear the weather forecast.
I'm upset about Aunt Yoyita, too.
But if everybody starts doing what they feel like, where will it all end?
Okay, no problem.
Turn it off.
During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries,
Bayamo was the most important smuggling centre on the island.
In this way they made a mockery of restrictions and the rigid trade monopoly of the Spanish Crown, which stifled economic growth.
Illegal trade with the
English, French and...
Illegal trade with the
English, French and Dutch was practised by all the locals, including the administrative, military and religious authorities.
Their dealings with the
Protestants, branded as heretics, not only influenced economic growth, but also affected cultural and political life.
Through this channel, the doors were opened for books banned by the Inquisition and the liberal and progressive ideas of the time.
It was no coincidence that Bayamo was the first city to rise in arms against the colonial domination which was stifling the development of the country.
Close it up.
- The toilet?
- At the back on the right.
I'm going to have some coffee made.
There's no snack today.
Adolfo, I've been thinking.
This system costs the same.
The mileage is the same.
But the use of resources is economically fairer, and in accord with the national planning system.
Adolfo, I'm an economist.
Don't you realize, then, that invoicing the critical route guarantees company management at all levels?
Moreover, it makes for a better distribution of the social product, not to mention more efficient statistical records.
You may be an expert economist, but administration has you beat.
What about the sufferers?
The dead don't suffer.
And as for the living...
Okay.
You know best.
Look, Gina.
You know what this could mean for me.
For us.
You know how important appearances are in this country.
Statistics...
Give me a break for once!
Cándido...
Cándido, please, don't take any notice of Adolfo.
He's under a lot of strain.
This relay system was his idea, and he thinks that, if it works, he might win back their confidence.
You know that someone who got as far as he did only to be assigned the job of undertaker...
It's not easy.
- Shall we have a drop of coffee?
- No.
I'll bring you one anyway.
Cándido, your coffee.
Do you not feel well, Cándido?
Let's go outside.
I'll take your coffee.
Let's go out for some fresh air.
Hey, hey!
Be careful!
Watch out!
Idiot!
Hey!
What's the matter?
- What's wrong?
- My wife's in labour.
- Bloody hell!
- Oh, blessed St. Barbara!
- Speak to my boss.
- Not in there, woman!
Not in that car, in this one.
Can you take us to Bayamo?
But we're on our way to Las Tunas.
We've just come from Bayamo.
She can't wait.
Bayamo isn't far.
But this is a funeral, a funeral...!
And they're having a baby.
A birth!
Blessed
St. Barbara. Help!
Hey, Adolfo, it's not the car's fault.
It's okay, calm down.
Adolfo, we're taking her!
Hang on, baby!
Get into the hearse and wait for us in Las Tunas.
Come on! I've got to take this woman. Come on!
Take it easy.
Hang on, baby, hang on!
You're crazy!
- I didn't need a lift to Havana.
- Listen, let me explain.
Because I've found someone forty times the man you are.
Do you hear? I don't need you!
Bastard! Do you hear?
- I don't need you!
- Shit!
- Fucking hell!
- Hey, cut it out!
That'll teach you to have more respect.
To the hospital!
Let's see.
That needs stitching. It looks really bad. Yes, to Bayamo.
I'll unhook the trailer and go back to Bayamo. I'll be back in an hour.
- No...
- I'll be back in an hour!
If you don't like the idea, walk!
Press to stop the bleeding.
S.O.S. Can you hear me? Over.
Patrol here. Identify
yourself. Over.
We have an emergency.
A woman in labour.
This is special service car N°13 from the base in Guantánamo.
From the American naval base
in Guantánamo? Over.
No, from the city of Guantánamo...
From the special service taxi base N°13.
Listen, we're on the Las Tunas-Bayamo road, heading for Bayamo. Over.
I read you.
Take it easy.
Take it easy!
You're bloody joking!
State exact position. Over.
Well, she's in the back seat.
Where? Repeat, please.
Six miles from Bayamo, on the highway. Over.
Don't lose your patience, miss.
Yamilé, she's called Yamilé.
The daughter of Tomás the islander.
We'll send an escort.
Be patient. Over.
- Pant!
- Pant, pant!
Careful with the baby!
Hey, doc!
She looks just like me.
She's just like me, driver.
Thanks, mate.
Hey, Mariano, let's go, okay?
Pardon me for saying so, but it's a relief to be free of your husband.
I'm as honest as I am ugly, and now that we're alone, as the saying goes,
I've a proposition to make.
Up ahead, I've got a friend who runs a "paladar", a clandestine inn.
It's a clean, decent place, and for one peso we can eat a great amarillo with pork.
I've got a few bucks on me, so three can eat as well as one.
Thanks, Tony, but I've got some dollars too.
The problem is, if we're late back,
Adólfo will hit the roof.
If he can wait for important things, he can wait for this.
Adolfo needn't find out.
Besides, he's half an hour ahead of schedule.
He said. So himself.
Believe me,
Adolfo is capable of taking us to Havana on just two bananas.
Come on, Cándido.
In you go.
Paco!
Paco!
- What brings you here, brother?
- Customers.
We need a pork amarillo on the double.
On the double!
Okay. Raulito!
Put a cloth on this table.
Come in.
Get my seat ready.
Here you are.
- How much?
- 25. Genuine article.
Twenty... and a few bananas.
You're like Yoyita.
In name only.
We're both called Georgina.
There's something else,
I don't know but...
You really loved her, didn't you?
She had such a desire to live!
She?
Or you?
Hey, be careful! Go gently!
- Handle it with care!
- It slipped, boss.
Can't you do this some other time?
Don't worry.
This is straighforward.
We'll have the changeover done in ten minutes.
Everything was going fine, but now my plan's gone to pot.
Listen,
Justo rang and I told him you'd left for Camagüey.
Hey, don't get worked up.
You've had problems with your blood pressure already.
Come on, let's have a coffee.
If it hadn't been for that bloody baby...!
Excuse me, I'll wait for you outside.
- You've hardly touched your food.
- Neither have you.
We old people get by on little.
Loneliness is the worst sort of hunger.
Oh, Cándido, you're not alone.
People are really fond of you.
Besides, you've got your memories of Aunt Yoyita.
You know, all my life I've been waiting for a miracle.
I thought that some day I'd get to play in the Symphony Orchestra.
Maybe I was afraid to look fate in the eye. Who knows?
Yoyita became famous, but me...
Stuck in Gantánamo, with my saxhorn!
Oh, Cándido!
Damn it!
Fifty years putting off a trip to Havana!
My life kept getting smaller and smaller my friends started dying, or left the country.
It's always other people who die.
You never think about death until one fine day, there it is, right under your nose.
Are you people coming to eat?
- No, we brought our own food.
- Okay, I'll only be ten minutes.
- How's things?
- Hey, how's things?
- How's business?
- Quiet.
- We'll liven it up for you.
- Come on in.
What happened to you?
Professor!
Mariano!
Cándido, look, it's Mariano.
- Don't get up. How do you do.
- How do you do.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
I'm not a professor now, just Gina.
The food's good here, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Do you feel ill?
- No, no...
If you'll excuse me...
I'm just going to the toilet.
What a coincidence!
Meeting three times in the same day after so long without seeing each other!
Yes, it's odd.
Why were you at the hospital?
Nothing...
- Mi colleague had an accident.
- Really?
Yes, we ran into a... a cow in the road.
But it was nothing serious.
He just bumped his forehead.
- Why were you there?
- Another accident.
But different. I was with a girl who gave birth to a lovely daughter.
But, weren't you going to a funeral?
Well, there you are...
Some depart and others arrive.
That's life, right?
Gina, do you still teach?
Don't be so formal.
Do you still teach?
No.
I got tired of hitting my head against a brick wall.
Shame!
But still, you're an intelligent woman with millions of opportunities.
Thanks.
It's not the end of the world, is it?
And in the end, I reckon the brick wall yields.
- Do you think so?
- Yes.
You...
You know that better than anyone.
Do you remember? Everything changes, everything evolves.
Dialectics!
I'm so glad I bumped into you.
It was me who bumped into you.
I shouldn't have written that note.
But I had to tell you somehow.
Mariano, please.
Yes, forgive me, but...
So you became an engineer!
Tell me all about it.
Gina...
I'd write you the same note.
I must leave.
It was a beautiful letter.
God, I...!
Careful there, gently does it!
Goodness!
You've got the best car in the country.
We should be on the road by now.
Where the devil are those people?
Calm down! You're not going to put out a fire!
THE TIME HAS COME
TO PRESERVE OUR DREAMS.
About bloody time!
Where have you been?
- Come in and have something to eat.
- No, thank you. Here.
- What's this?
- A snack I bought you in a café.
Come on, let's get going!
Gina, come on!
When a flower wilts and dies,
another springs up in its place.
And if a love is lost,
Life takes on another love.
Mariano remembers Gina,
Gina remembers Mariano.
It needn't be a barren memory
the one which springs up
between them.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
The deceased's sister and niece have been calling from Havana.
They're concerned about the delay.
What do they expect? We've stuck to the original plan exactly.
- We're in Camagüey as scheduled.
- Now comes the difficult bit.
Camagüey to Santa Clara.
With a brief stop in Sancti Spíritus.
Remember!
That bitch Paula's there!
There are people in the cafeteria pretending to be bereaved.
Can't you sort it out?
Are you all asleep?
One moment, your ticket.
- Haven't you got a ticket?
- Just a minute.
There's a sign here that clearly says this café is only for mourners.
- I'm a mourner.
- So am I.
Is that so?
Well, I'm not having it.
Listen, here the snacks and the coffee are ordered in advance.
And its all paid for by the close relatives.
Excuse me, what's the problem, sir?
My uncle died last week but nobody gave me a free snack!
- We all have the same rights here.
- Yes, no more privileges!
Anyone would think this was...!
Comrades, comrades!
I've been waiting ages and they've not given me anything.
I have a ticket and I'm entitled.
I know my rights.
Everybody out!
You too.
You too.
I want everybody out!
Now! The cafeteria's closed.
That's the way to do it!
Dead dogs don't bite.
I've got used to it.
It's the best way.
You suffer less.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
Ah, Cándido!
I think I missed my chance without even noticing.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
How do you recognize it?
It all happens so fast.
You feel it.
It's something special, like... having and itchy jaw.
Has yourjaw never itched?
Cándido, I'm a married woman!
You're blind, that's what you are.
Ramón, how are you?
Oh, darling, I've been waiting.
Oh, my sweet, I love you.
What took you so long?
Hey, honey, listen.
- I can't stay. I'm pushed for time.
- Yes, come one down.
Hey, give me that. I can't!
Give me that back.
Listen, the lorry broke down and I really haven't got time!
Let's go to the house and I'll do something that you'll just love.
- Come on!
- Come here, love. I'm not joking.
Hey, listen.
I've been thinking, it's about time I took life seriously.
I'm so glad, honey.
I've been thinking the same
We should live together and be happy.
Let's go to the house,
I want to do things to you.
Come on, baby...
- What's up?
- Let's go to the house.
Ramón, we'll be right back.
Be good.
Hey, honey, what's your hurry?
Hey, what's going on?
Where's the linesman?
- Honey, get dressed, we've no time.
- After this, you'll never forget me.
I love you.
- Come to me.
- We haven't time.
I love you, come...
- I've got to go!
- I'll say things I've never said.
Linesman!
Listen! They're calling you.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
What's the matter?
What! Raise this barrier right now.
There isn't a train in sight.
Wait there, I'm coming!
Why all the hurry?
Get this jalopy rolling.
Come on, men, let's go.
Oh, my love, these people never leave you in peace.
God! The train!
Hilda!
Hilda!
Hilda!
Hey, move that.
Are you mad?
Mad about you, my love.
I'm not moving until you give me a kiss.
Besides, look!
Look what I've got you!
Mammee apple!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hail Mary, God Almighty! Why won't they let me finish with you?
Don't budge, baby.
I'm going to do something to you that you'll love.
- Hey, what's that all about?
- Oh, it's...
It's nothing. Don't get jealous.
I'm all yours, you know that.
I'm crazy about you.
Open up, open up!
Adolfo!
Now what's wrong?
The fan belt's broken.
- You've got a spare, haven't you?
- I haven't got anything.
- Why the bloody hell not?
- What about you?
Have you got a spare liver, eh?
You're going to need it!
We must do something.
- That's more like it!
- Now! I want clockwork precision.
We're 15 miles from Camagüey,
90 miles from Sancti Spíritus.
You, go with me. You, in the Volga.
I must sort this out with Rivero.
You, watch the car.
Hey!
- What's the problem, mate?
- The fan belt's gone.
Why didn't you say?
I've got a spare one.
I always carry one in the back of the lorry.
Let's see what size it is.
- I'll go and fetch one.
- Good man!
What are you doing? No, no!
Heaven forbid! Me, charge you?
Take advantage of this situation?
You can have it. Put that away.
Thanks, son.
Let me pass!
Let me pass!
I'm leaving.
I've got to get back to work.
That's just about got it.
You can start it now.
Me?
Gina!
Mariano!
You asshole!
- What are you doing with her?
- Listen, calm down, calm down!
What's up?
- I'll kill you!
- Calm down, there's been a mix-up.
We're going, Cándido.
Get in.
- Where to? Get in where?
- In the car! Get in the car!
- This one?
- Yes!
- What's the matter, Gina?
- Nothing.
Nothing's the matter.
You really dropped me in it with that jalopy.
Listen, Adolfo, while you've got that car, I have to bury my dead with a horse drawn carriage.
What planet are you living on?
You're responsible for this disaster, and you have to find a solution!
I haven't got a fan belt for that car!
- Get it into your thick head!
- Look for one, then!
- Look where?
- Take one from another car.
This is sabotage! And the consequences could be serious!
Listen a minute, Adolfo.
Let's find a solution.
You know I'm no amateur in this.
I've got a clean record...
What happened?
Nothing, he found a fan belt and...
Come on, Cándido.
Get in there.
We'll use the hearse and have it sent back to Rivero later.
Come on, let's not waste any more time.
- What's up?
- The usual. A corpse.
- It has to be buried in Cárdenas.
- So what?
I've no more hearses! We're in a state of necrological alert here!
But if they say he lived here, why don't they bury him here?
Old man Orlando stated in his will that if he died in Cárdenas, he was to be buried in Sancti Spíritus, and if he died in Sancti Spíritus, he was to be buried in Cárdenas.
What for?
Just to fuck someone up.
And you're that someone.
Do you know what this means?
We'll have to dovetail the services.
But I've got to get to Havana!
And old Orlando to Cárdenas.
The law is the same for everyone.
But this is something unexpected.
Death is always unexpected.
You should know that, from yourjob.
- Where's the office, please?
- Up there.
Thank you.
Adolfo, what did the old lady die of?
Being a whore.
At her age she starts having it off
- with a ridiculous old man...
- I won't stand for that!
Listen, I didn't...
Have some respect for the dead!
Have a good trip.
That was quite ajob!
Okay, Susi, remember about next week.
Okay, big boy.
Next week they're bringing me the black beans and turkeys I ordered.
Take care, and don't get lost, okay?
- Why should I want to do that?
- I love you.
You're such a sweetie.
Look after the pig, okay?
- And look after yourself.
- Yes. Let's go.
What's up now, Ramón?
Get out.
- What?
- I said get out.
What for?
Because we need to fill up with petrol, Mariano, and who's in the next petrol station? Wina!
Your women are too aggressive.
I don't want any part of it.
No, man. Wina's no problem.
I'm the one who's in a mess!
Why?
No reason. Let's get going.
Hey, come on, brother. I told you, there won't be any hassle.
Oh, Mariano, shit...
Mariano!
What?
I have to talk to you about...
What's up, Mariano?
No, nothing.
Well, yes...
I like you a lot.
- Well...
- Mariano,
I got married two weeks ago.
You're kidding!
Fuck me!
That's great...!
Don't pretend, Mariano.
You came to ditch me.
Me?
Yes, you.
How's things?
Fine.
Let's have a coffee.
Ramón!
Come and have a coffee.
Come and have a coffee.
No, it's okay, thanks.
Come on, there's no problem.
Come on!
Wina!
Have you got a pen?
What's up now, Mariano?
Hey, wait there, brother.
Hey!
I'm sorry, but I'm going on alone.
I'm so ashamed.
It was all so unpleasant.
Why? It has nothing to do with you.
- You don't belong with that animal.
- Don't be like that.
Pay no attention to him. Don't you realize that he's insensitive?
It's because he is insensitive that you don't belong with him.
I'm the one who feels sad really sad, when I see how you're throwing your life away on that man.
- It's not fair!
- Oh, Cándido.
There are times in life when you have to make decisions.
I've made mine.
Oh, look.
It's the deceased's granddaughter.
Thanks to them
I'll get to Cárdenas.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Pleased to meet you.
Take care.
Great care.
- Bye.
- See you soon.
- Gina.
- Yes?
I don't like to interfere, but I was just passing...
What's up? Talking again?
Come on. We've wasted enough time. Gina. Come on.
Well, we'll be seeing you.
Make sure you tell Paula.
You should never tread on
your neighbour's feelings,
because the wind
will blow away
that sort of behaviour.
What has your life been,
Adolfo?
Without principles,
without decency,
with no respect for love,
it's a lost battle.
Guantanamera,
guajira guantanamera,
guantanamera,
- The body for Cardenas is yours.
- No.
I said this was madness from the start, and no one listened.
Now the facts have proved me right.
In no time at all, three funerals have passed through here, one for Cienfuegos, another for Aguada de Pasajeros, and the third for Sancti Spíritus.
The corpse bound for Cárdenas is all yours!
I pioneered this operation, and I do the calculations.
My funeral gets priority.
Well, whether you like it or not,
I can't separate the funerals because I've only got one hearse left.
This isn't over yet! I'm taking it up with the pertinent authorities.
Take it to the top, if you like.
I'm as happy with a funeral as a homage.
You say he'd never had a sick day in his life?
The poor thing was full of life.
He liked walking, horse riding, climbing hills...
He didn't want to die and... just look...
- How are you?
- So, so...
The day of his 107th birthday, the photographer asked him to step back from the camera, to get a better photo.
A bit further back, a bit further...
But he didn't know he was on the edge of a precipice.
It's my first visit to Santa Clara.
- I've never visited anywhere.
- Oh, Cándido!
Look!
Just like Yoyita's dress.
Remember?
Yes, we bought it together.
Yes.
Well, it would look lovely on you.
- Hi, Tony.
- Hello.
Do you sell soft drinks?
We've only got tea and rum.
- Would you like a tea, Cándido?
- Okay...
Two teas.
Just a minute, I'll be right back.
Listen, friend, you can't fit two coffins in this hearse without damaging them.
We'll have to wait for the hearse from Camagüey.
How long will that take?
An hour, an hour and a half.
No way. We're in a real hurry.
Let's try a little harder, push a bit harder.
A bit more... push, push!
It's coming! That's got it!
There!
Gina!
You look like a whore with your hair loose.
I don't trust that old man.
You're to stop talking to him.
And you can change that dress right now!
Listen when I'm talking!
Keep out of it, old man.
Who do you think you are?
Stop!
- Let her go, dammit!
- What the...!
Come on, mate.
I told you,
I'm tired of telling you...
You enjoy looking for trouble.
In the beginning
Olofin made man and woman
and gave them life.
Olofin made life,
but he forgot to make death.
The years passed
and the men and women
got older and older,
but they did not die.
The Earth filled up with people
who were thousands of years old,
and who still ruled according
to their ancient laws.
The young people
clamoured such that
one day their cries
reached the ears
of Olofin.
Olofin saw that the world
was not as good as he had
planned.
He felt
that he also was
too old and tired
to begin again
what had turned out so badly.
So Olofin called lkú
to take care of the matter.
And lkú saw
that it was time to put
an end to the era
in which people did not die.
So lkú caused it to rain
upon the earth for 30 days
and 30 nights without end,
and all was covered
with water.
Only
the children and the young were
able to climb the giant trees
and climb the highest mountains.
The whole Earth became
a huge river with no banks.
The young people then saw
that the Earth was cleaner
and more beautiful,
and ran to give thanks to lkú
for putting and end
to immortality.
They told me the one on the right.
- That one has to go to Havana.
- No, this is the right one.
The one on the right is this one, old man.
We're not going to spend all day here arguing.
One has a blue ribbon attached.
It's the other one.
This one?
Exactly.
Excuse me, miss.
When's the next bus to Havana?
Ticket sales are suspended until tomorrow.
Thank you.
Hello, Adolfo.
How was the journey?
Look, this is the car.
This is your driver.
I'll send you some men right away to help with the changeover.
I've a terrible headache.
Do you have an aspirin?
Certainly, madam.
Follow me to the office.
Come on, Adolfo.
I know how uncomfortable these journeys can be.
Brother, I need a favour.
I've come from the East and
I've got the boot full of stuff.
I tell you, madam, they'll have to give your husband a medal when he gets to Havana.
Gina!
Forgive me, I didn't know what I was doing.
Don't be like this, not now when I need you most.
There are 60 miles left to Havana.
Change that dress.
Back in Guantánamo, everything will be just as it was.
Nothing will be the same now.
I know you too well.
And I'm tired of not thinking.
If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
Everyone makes mistakes.
That radio show José Luis keeps offering me, I'm going to accept.
A radio programme?
On youth guidance?
You weren't even capable of bringing up your own bloody daughter.
I'm fed up of your blaming me for Niurka's going to Miami!
Who was it who let her hang around with those hairy pseudo-intellectuals and listen to their songs?
Who let her read magazines about
"perestroika" and all that shit?
Oh, Adolfo!
Remember the things she came out with?
For the first time I had to raise my hand to her.
My own daughter!
Of course she bloody left, after you poisoned her mind!
Niurka didn't leave because of her friends, or the songs, or what she read.
She left because she had to do all those things in secret.
- And she was fed up of that!
- No!
Wait! I let you have your say, now it's my turn.
Yes, you're right.
Who am I to to give guidance to anyone?
If I take on that programme, as I want to, it's not to tell anyone what to think.
Far be it from me to give anyone instructions!
You don't know me at all.
As for the dress,
I'm not changing it.
It's there in the back.
Cover it with the flowers.
Shit! This is going to be a problem.
Put it here, and if it lifts its head, just push it down again.
Here.
A gift.
Come on, old timer.
So they dropped you like a hot potato in the middle of the road?
No.
I left of my own accord, to get away from that animal.
It seems some people put up with him very well.
Listen, old man.
I need a favour.
When you see Gina, tell her I want her to forgive me.
I get into all sorts of trouble for not minding my own business.
Why not ask her yourself, son?
See what she says.
I hope I never bump into that woman again.
The name's Ramón.
Just ask for me at work.
Help him down, Mariano.
Be careful, there.
Well, son...
Take care.
Cándido!
I'll give you a written report tomorrow.
But I can tell you now, we saved no less than sixty litres of petrol and two days expenses in cash.
Any trouble on the way?
There are always problems, but there are always solutions, too.
In Sancti Spíritus I put the two coffins for Cárdenas together.
Here's the order.
Here it is.
Shit!
What's wrong?
Cándido, please...
- The ladder.
- Yes.
Dear friends, families of the deceased.
On this morning we are united by a great sorrow.
Two very dear people are no longer with us.
Out of love, and only love, they have crossed the threshold of silence which leads us to immortality.
We are here today to say farewell to two unforgettable people, two lovers who, across time and space, kept their hearts united.
Two beings, consecrated to love,
Aunt Yoyita, as her nearest and dearest affectionately called her, and that fine fellow, Cándido, the generous musician who often cheered our Sundays from the bandstand in our distant hometown,
Guantánamo.
They lived the most sublime moments of love.
For years, only their memory kept alive the flame of that love...
A love which grew in their hearts, until, suddenly, both hearts burst as one in a flood of happiness, joy and immaculate glory.
In that one moment they touched the bounds of eternity.
Death unites them today in an imperishable embrace.
Those who die of love bequeath a lesson, at their passing, to those of us who remain, disconsolate and somewhat Ionelier on this side of the threshold.
That lesson, my friends, teaches us that love is the salt of life.
It is our task to follow the path which they trod, hand in hand like two lovers in search of eternal bliss.
Hey, listen!
Don't go!
Wait! I haven't finished my speech.
Help!
Don't leave me here alone!
Help!
The ladder!
Bring me the ladder!
Penny for the Guy?
Penny for the Guy?
Got a problem, George?
There's a young boy gone missing.
This is shaping up to be a busy night.
Lucky for you you're on leave.
Yeah, I'll send you a postcard.
Thank you.
A bacon sandwich for later, Jack.
But don't tell the chef.
Thanks, love.
Hey.
Come out of there!
Control?
Rockingham Hall Hotel?
Well I hope they have a nice evening.
Thank you.
Sounds like a good party.
Off for your fortnight.
Got your bucket and spade?
Yes, thank you.
Bill, they've found that missing boy.
Dead in a dustbin in Patriot Street.
Doc's on his way, but I can't raise DCI Peters.
He's at a high level piss up at the Rockingham Hall Hotel.
So's Mullett.
And what about Wonder Woman?
She's supposed to be senior officer tonight.
Who's Wonder Woman?
Just come to us from Furnley Division.
Looks like she's switched her bleeper off.
Typical!
Jack, hold on a minute....
No, not me - no.
It's a dead kid.
I need a senior officer.
I'm supposed to be on holiday.
All right, guv?
All right.
Tell me what you've got.
Dead boy, sir.
We think he's Bobby Kirkby.
Reported missing this evening.
Number twenty Lacey Street.
Parents?
Mother separated from father.
She and the boyfriend nipped down the pub.
Left the kid watching telly.
When they got back about ten o'clock, he'd disappeared.
Has anyone told them?
No.
Good.
Nice little job for Mr. Peters.
All right.
Let's have a look.
What the bloody hell's that?
That's his guy, sir.
Doc's on his way.
Poor little devil.
What rotten bastard did that to you, sonny.
Look out, wonder woman is here.
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
Now get out of here.
I've got one of those.
Mine says Detective
Inspector Frost.
I'm sorry, sir.
I thought Inspector
Peters was...
Yeah, and he thought that you were.
That's why he went to a party.
You switched your ruddy bleeper off, didn't you?
Sometimes I need a bit of personal space to myself, sir.
Tried round-the-word yachting?
Don't do it again.
Hello, here's Doctor Death.
Looks like he choked on his own vomit.
You can move him whenever you want.
Thanks.
Time of death would be helpful.
Cold night, slows rigor down, somewhere between six and seven hours.
Four or five this evening then.
All right, that means he didn't die here.
Do share your medical expertise with us, Inspector.
Well, the shops don't close 'till six, that's when they put their rubbish out.
Yes,
I'd guess he died elsewhere and was probably dumped here about four hours ago.
Excuse me, guv.
DCI Peters isn't coming.
He says can you finish off here tonight, and he'll take over in the morning.
Yeah, all right, thank you.
That means we've got to go and inform the kid's family.
Oh, well, your car or mine, love?
Better take mine.
And I'm not your love, sir.
In that case you can call me guv, love.
Yes, sir.
Reggie?
Bloody hell.
You stay here.
Carole?
Carole?
Reggie?
Are you all right?
Reggie?
What's going on?
What's happening?
She's gone.
She's gone.
Bloody hell!
Oh my god!
Hello?
What?
Have you found him yet, have you found him?
All right,
Mrs. Kirkby, it's all right.
All right, let's go inside.
Sergeant, please take
Mrs. Kirkby inside.
Found the little sod have you?
I'll ring his neck when I see him.
Are you the boyfriend?
Yeah, Terry Green.
All right, Terry, can we go inside please.
Yeah, come in.
I need to know, please.
It's bad news, isn't it?
Why do you have to be so negative all the time?
Can we all calm down, please!
Can we calm down!
Thank you.
Mrs. Kirkby, do you mind sitting down.
Terry, thank you.
Right.
Now, Mrs Kirkby,
I'm afraid I've go to ask you a few questions.
When Bobby went out tonight he took his Guy Fawkes with him, didn't he?
Can you tell me what it looked like?
What does a guy usually look like?
Sorry.
Did it have a mask of an old man and a green zip up jacket?
What are you telling me, he's dead?
Sir?
Thank you.
Is this a photograph of Bobby?
It's a school photo, it was taken last week
Iook, have you found him?
No we haven't, we've just found his guy.
Remember when kids grew up in families?
World's changed, hasn't it, Inspector?
Yeah, you're right there.
Control from Alpha Bravo 24.
Go ahead, Jack.
The dead kid is not Bobby Kirkby.
Repeat not Bobby Kirkby.
Which means we've got a murder and a missing boy, so you'll have to organize a search team.
Pull in extra men if necessary.
Yes, Jack.
So who's the dead kid?
I've no idea.
Any other boy reported missing?
No, but the pathologist wants you over at the mortuary.
All right, I'm on my way.
Come on, let's go.
Right, sexual interference, none.
If that was ever the intention it wasn't carried out.
Good.
But other things were.
First there's a faint mark around the hairline, meaning something had been put over his head.
A hairnet or a shower cap.
A shower cap?
Next, as well as being gagged with masking tape he'd been anaesthetized with chloroform.
Why anaesthetize him?
Presumably to aid the amputation.
What amputation?
The boy's left hand little finger has been removed.
A clean surgical cut above the knuckle with a sharp blade.
Was this before or after death?
Definitely before.
Poor little bastard.
Oh, I doubt he knew anything about it, that's why he was chloroformed.
And I doubt they intended his death.
That happened because he choked on his vomit, he'd eaten shortly before he died, a frankfurter and bread roll.
Any idea what time he'd eaten it?
Died around six thirty, somewhere in the region of five thirty.
Quite unusual, don't you think?
Yeah, yes I do.
All right.
Thank you
Sir.
Good Morning.
Ah, hello George.
Good morning.
I thought you were off on holiday?
Yes, so did I, but the new bank manager here wanted to see me.
I think he's a bit worried about my overdraft.
Well, he must have had a bit of a night last night,
I've just had to take him an Alka-Seltzer.
You didn't.
Yes.
Anyway, what do you think of this new nick, eh?
What about all this carpet?
Who ever heard of a nick with carpets?
I mean how are we going to hear when Hornrim' Harry's on the prowl?
You won't, will you.
Come in.
You don't approve of our new building?
Yes, yes I do sir.
It's very nice.
Pity to fill it up with all these coppers though, isn't it?
Take a seat, Jack.
Right.
Now I'm afraid something rather unpleasant happened last night.
Yes, I know sir.
Yes, there was a reception for senior officers at the Rockingham Hall Hotel.
I see you enjoyed it.
As a matter of fact, I didn't.
On the way home, one of the cars skidded on a patch of oil and collided with a lamppost, four regional officers were in it.
All of them sustained broken bones.
Shouldn't they all be in hospital, sir?
They are in hospital.
Which means that
DCI Peters has had to move to Lexford Division as from this morning.
Which means that
I need you here to take over his cases, and his paperwork.
Now I understand you've already started on the missing boy case.
Just a minute, sir,
I'm on holiday, didn't you get my postcard?
Yes, look, we'll make it up to you somehow, Jack.
Morning, sir.
Morning.
I was just trying to work out how to get my pork pie into this new microwave.
Have you seen
Chief Inspector Peters?
I want to give him the file on the Bobby Kirkby case.
Ah, Inspector Peters?
He's in Lexford, love.
Apparently four top men drank too much single malt last night, wrapped their car round a lamppost, so Mr. Peters has been seconded and I'm taking over his caseload.
I see, sir.
Yes, all right,
I don't like it either.
Especially as it makes us one man short.
I think you mean one person short, don't you, sir?
Yes.
All right, okay, can I have your attention everybody?
All right, all right.
All right,
I hope you're all settling in to your nice new state of the art offices.
All right, well, listen,
I've got some bad news and I've got some good news.
Last night DCI Formby was involved in a motor accident and broke both legs and an arm, yes I know.
Now the bad news,
DCI Peters has been seconded to Lexford, so that means I'm in charge of the missing child case.
No, that's okay, don't get excited.
Mr. Mullett?
Would you like to say a few words, sir?
No, no, carry on.
Fine, thank you.
My beautiful assistant will now show the first slide.
If you'd switch the lights off, sir?
All right, this is
Bobby Kirkby, age 9, of a no-parent family, he went missing last night between 7 and 10pm. whilst his mother and her boyfriend went down the boozer.
We have one lead.
That's this.
That's his Guy Fawkes.
It was found by
Constable Packer amongst a load of rubbish in Patriot Street.
Unfortunately he found something else.
The body of another boy.
Now we don't know who the victim is.
All we do know is that he was naked, he'd been chloroformed, he was gagged with masking tape.
One other strange thing, someone had cut off his finger on his left hand.
So think about it.
Here we've got a kid who disappears, dead for twenty four hours, and no-one reports him missing.
So we've got a missing boy and a murder to solve.
There is one clue, half an hour before this little boy died, he ate a frankfurter.
Superintendent.
Might I have a word, sir?
Yes, of course you can, my dear.
What's that about, Jack?
It's Wonder Woman.
She wants to be made up into Acting DI.
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah
She's only been here a week and she thinks she owns the place.
She wants to be in control.
But she doesn't know
Hornrim' Harry yet, does she?
Jack?
Yeah.
A vicar's picked up a naked girl in Crossfield Lane.
It's wonderful how the
Church of England's changing, isn't it?
Jack, she'd been abducted.
Oh, no, not another one.
How was Mr. Mullett, helpful, was he?
I found him very supportive.
Oh, yes.
Oh, he's wonderful like that.
Offer you promotion, did he?
He recognized that
I work hard on my cases and I get results.
And I'm probably more highly qualified than any other officer.
Make you anxious that I'm ambitious?
Me?
Oh, no.
I used to be like that myself,
'till I got shot in the head.
Okay,
Iet's go and surprise
Mr. Reggie Stansfield and family.
You know him already?
Oh, yes, I know
Reggie Stansfield.
I tell you what, Sergeant.
Why don't you take charge of this case?
Well, about bloody time!
I know you, don't I?
Yes, Mr Stansfield, it was that arson attack on your office about four years ago.
Yes, well let's hope you do a better job this time.
Ah, well, I'm not in charge.
This is the investigating officer,
Detective Sergeant Maude.
I'm not being fobbed off, am I?
Oh, no, sir, she's first class,
I'm second class.
Well if you'd like to invite us in,
I'm sure the Sergeant here would like to ask a few questions.
Yes, well, come in.
Those bastards broke into my house, stole my wife's fur coats and jewelry, kidnapped my daughter and subjected her to a night of terror, and then they ripped me off for 25 thousand quid.
It's not been your day,
Mr. Stansfield.
Or should I say, night?
Where were you when this happened?
We'd gone out for a very nice evening, to Phantom Of The Opera.
When we got back, I saw the door was open.
I'd rather hear you tell it, Carole.
I went to bed early and I was just gonna switch off the light when I heard breaking glass downstairs.
And then the light went out and then I tried to call the police but the phone wouldn't work, and I heard someone coming upstairs, and this man came in with a knife.
Go on, darling.
I tried to scream, but he held the knife to my throat.
I must have passed out.
The next thing I knew,
I was in the back of a van with a sack over me.
And they tore my nightdress off.
Did they touch you?
If they abused you there are DNA tests.
No, they didn't do anything.
How long were you in the van, Carole?
Hours.
They stopped in the woods and smoked.
And then in the morning, someone banged on the side and said
'we've got the money', and then they pushed me out and drove off.
So you paid the ransom, sir?
The phone rang as soon as we got home.
I was down at the bank the moment it opened.
And you could lay your hands on 25 thousand?
Well, obviously.
You're not thinking of leaving, are you, Inspector?
No, no, Mr Stansfield, no, no, if you'd like to continue to answer the
Sergeant's questions,
I'd just like to take a look round.
Thank you.
Morning, Hammond.
Inspector.
Morning.
Sir.
So, this is how they got in.
That's right, sir.
Nobody leaves fingerprints any more.
Modern crooks, they've no consideration.
People are funny, aren't they.
They go to all this expense to fit a security mortice lock and look at that, look. they leave the key in the lock.
How did they switch the electricity off?
Mains cupboard, sir, above the microwave, here.
Oh, here.
Why would they do that, do you think?
Cut off the cordless phone?
Yeah, whenever I want my cordless phone to stop
I throw it against the wall.
Mind you, it was only off for a couple of minutes.
Well, they were pretty damn quick.
They must have known the layout.
The house has been on the market, sir.
The owner reckons the intruders posed as prospective buyers.
Oh, well.
Yeah, he's got an answer for everything, he has.
Alpha, Bravo, one, two?
Frost.
I got the money from the bank and drove to Crossfield Road,
Iike they said.
And left it by the bridge...
Sergeant, time to go.
Sorry Mr Stansfield, something rather important's come up.
Now wait a minute!
What can be more important than what's happened to Carole?
Sir, you told me that was my case,
I'm getting full details of the abduction then you come
Oh, you think it's an abduction then, do you?
Sir, that girl was obviously traumatized, she's only fifteen,
I suppose from the male point of view that's not very serious, is it?
Now listen, four years ago,
Customs and Excise fingered Stansfield for a VAT fiddle.
But low and behold, the day before they went in there was an arson attack on his office, so all the paperwork was destroyed.
They never traced the arsonist.
And you think he started it himself.
That's my theory, yes, though I never proved it.
So now you've got another theory that this is an insurance fraud?
Yeah, well there's only one snag isn't there, the girl would have to be in on it as well.
Come on, what kind of father's going to put his daughter through what she went through.
A father by the name of Reggie Stansfield
Where are we going, sir?
A woman has just reported her eight year old son missing.
I thought he was in bed.
I work at the Coconut Grove.
It's a casino.
I'm a dealer on the
Black Jack tables.
Eight in the evening
'til four in the morning, well, you take what you can get, don't you?
Usually I look in on
Dean when I get back, but last night...
You brought someone home.
I'm not a tart, honest.
I needed money, and sometimes punters don't like knowing there's a kid in the house.
What was the name of this man?
I didn't ask.
When he went
I just fell asleep and I woke up about half an hour ago.
And found Dean's bed hadn't been slept in.
He's probably got himself lost, that's what's happened,
I mean we've only been in Denton a week.
And where was Dean going yesterday?
I gave him money for the pictures.
Canon Cinema, on Princess Street.
And you told him to buy a frankfurter.
How do you know that?
Mrs. Anderton...
Miss.
Sorry, Miss.
Miss. Anderton.
Have you got any friends, or relatives you could call.
Oh, no, no.
It's all right' it's gonna be all right.
No.
Dean Anderton is dead.
Bobby Kirkby is missing and we've got a child killer out there.
I want you to pull your finger out, you're not making enough effort.
I want someone to go down to the council yard and check every one of their rubbish sacks that they collected yesterday.
Come!
Jack, sorry to interrupt.
Sandy Longford's on the phone, says it's urgent.
And it's relevant to the case.
All right.
Liz, take over.
Came this morning, by hand.
Inside a letter and a tape.
The letter's written on a dot matrix printer.
Oh, yeah, what's that?
Comes off a computer.
Oh, Sandy, please.....
Oh, sorry.
By now my dabs will be all over it.
Yeah but that would be when you photocopied it, wouldn't it?
Don't worry, go on, put it in one of those plastic folders for me, will you?
Come on, come on, read it to me!
I have Bobby Kirkby.
I require five hundred thousand pounds from Sir Richard Cordwell,
Managing Director, at Cordwell Supermarkets.
To be paid tonight in full.
His company can well afford this and more, if he refuses and the money is not delivered, the boy will die in circumstances in which I will never be identified.
Sir Richard will be held responsible as your paper will explain to the public.
Sir Richard has been sent the same package, any sign of police interference and the boy will die.
All right, play the tape.
My name is Bobby Kirkby.
It cuts out their for a moment.
Poor little devil.
The bastard's making him read it.
This is a message for
Sir Richard Cordwell.
If you do what the man says, he'll let me go.
He's says if you don't get him the money today or if you try to find him, or go to the police, you've go proof what will happen to me.
Well, is it genuine?
Yes, it is.
This is what
I was afraid of.
This is a right clever dick this is, isn't it?
It's sick, Jack.
Sickest.
Grab a kid, any kid will do.
Doesn't matter whether the parents can pay or not.
Because then you get some big company with an image to protect and you put them through the ringer, and if anything goes wrong, public outrage won't be directed against the kidnapper, the company will take the blame.
It's a big story, Jack.
I could sell it to the tabloids.
No you won't!
This is police property.
Give me one of those plastic folders, will you.
You are not going to report this, you keep stumm, all right?
Biggest scoop I ever had.
And it still will be tomorrow, when the boy's safe.
You will treat Sir Richard with respect, won't you?
I shall treat him with my usual tact, sir.
Superintendent Mullett?
Sir Richard's waiting.
I'll show you the way.
What are you doing, Jack?
Just checking the tax disc, sir.
Come!
Superintendent Mullett and Inspector Frost, sir.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, Sir Richard.
Yes, good morning, sir.
You do know what this is all about?
I have received this letter, and a tape.
And a gruesome memento.
May we take it the letter's genuine?
Could you tell us what it says?
It orders me to pay half a million pounds in used notes at eight tonight in exchange for the life of a kidnapped boy.
Yes, it's genuine.
We've go one dead boy already.
Can I have it, sir?
No, Inspector, it's addressed to me.
It says if I cooperate with the police, the deal's off and the boy dies.
Which rather destroys the point of the exercise.
All right, can you tell us how the deal is to be done, so that after the exchange we can pick the kidnapper up?
If I have your word there'll be no police involvement until it's over.
Well, that's extremely difficult...
Yes you have my word.
Good, sit down.
I pack half a million in a bag and wait in my store in Market Street for telephoned instructions.
You can find that sort of money?
Yes, I can find that sort of money.
The question is, do I want to.
Have you got a photograph of...
Bobby Kirkby, sir.
Nice looking boy, it's a good photo.
What's the mother like.
Tearful, what do you expect?
Right, here's what we do.
Contact the mother and see if there are any more pics.
Bobby as a baby would be nice.
Get a press release ready for the Nationals.
Right.
Are you going to pay the ransom?
Of course.
Do you know how much it costs to make one TV commercial?
For this I get several millions of pounds worth of publicity.
Do you mind if I put a tracer in amongst the money, sir?
I most certainly would.
The aim of the exercise is to save the boy.
We need him on television with
Sir Richard in the morning.
We also have to capture this man, Sir Richard.
We believe he's murdered already.
He might well do it again.
Do what you like afterwards, it's no concern of mine.
But I do things my way.
This manic has abducted a child to make money out of me.
I'm responding with a commercial decision because the publicity is better than twopence off a can of beans.
That means no tricks, and no transmitters.
I expect you to keep your word there'll be no police involvement until it's over or the deal's off.
Yes, all right sir, I will.
You've no business giving him your word.
It's all right, sir,
I've no intention of keeping it.
I'm a bit like
Tricky Dicky in there,
I do things my way.
Right, this is the start of business.
Reggie Stansfield was already outside the bank when they opened.
He's talking to the cashier.
She's buzzing for the manager.
Why's she doing that?
He'd asked to draw out
25 thousand in cash.
Money had to be brought up from the vaults.
No wonder he looks worried.
Now hold it.
Who is that?
How would I know?
What's he doing now?
Waiting for the money to come up from the vault.
No, the other one, in the hood?
Looks like he's taking money out of a cash dispenser.
But look now he's gone to the automatic deposit machine.
Putting money back in?
Oh, yeah, it looks like it.
Yeah, but why?
Two different transactions.
No.
Playing for time..
What is this character's name?
Ian Grafton.
15A Fairfield Road.
Yeah?
Ian Grafton?
Detective Sergeant Maude.
Denton CID.
I wonder if we could have a talk?
Try the fettuccini alfredo, sir.
It's real Keith Floyd.
The vegetarian's very nice, Jack.
Yes, all right.
Thank you.
Burton, I hope your not going out flower arranging again tonight.
It's going to be a big op, is it?
Yes, as big as Hornrim
Harry will permit.
Oh, dear, guv'nor.
Yes Jack, what can I get you?
Sausage and chips please, love.
Sorry Jack, we don't serve that now.
All right.
Can you give me a portion of chipolatas, with a side serving of french fries, and can you open a tin of baked beans?
Certainly.
Thank you.
George.
Have you ever shopped at
Cordwell's on Market Street?
I have been in there, yeah.
All right, you know they've got a row of public telephones right by the main entrance.
I want them tapped.
You know those little electronic bugging devices.
I want you to get me one of those on the QT.
I'm going to put it in with the money.
It can be done, but how are you going to plant it?
Well, do you remember
Tommy Dunstan?
Who?
Tommy Dunstan.
You remember him.
He got the sack from the force for boozing.
Oh, him, yeah.
Well, you won't believe it but he's a security guard at Cordwell's.
Handy.
I'm going to get him to plant it.
How many cars?
Four.
It's all that Mullett would let me have.
It's not enough.
Yes it will be, because I'll have a tracer.
Sir?
Yeah.
You know that bloke in the bank when Reggie Stansfield was there?
Ian Grafton.
He's got a van just like the one
Carole was kidnapped in.
Sounds promising.
Trouble is it was parked outside the bank at half nine when she was still being held.
Are you sure of that?
He got a parking ticket.
That was a bit convenient.
Yeah, did wonder.
Your not actually trying to tell me that I might be right for once?
Oh, I wouldn't go that far, sir.
Well, I.....
Thank you.
What is all this?
There's a note here,
Jack, from forensic.
What's it say?
All this stuff was found in the canal this morning.
So what is it?
Well it's obvious isn't it?
What I want you to do is to take this round to Reggie Stansfield, who in fact will identify the lot, then I want you to take them round to an insurance assessor and find out what they're really worth.
Not a lot, I should think.
Not now, you pillock, before they went into the canal.
Then I want you to find out what Reggie Stansfield insured them for, all right.
Now keep your eye on them and I want you back here by six o'clock for the briefing.
Now go on, off you go.
Hello George.
Hello Tommy.
Hello, Jack.
All right, you're here.
Well, I see Denton nick's gone up in the world.
Two teas.
Yes.
First step to privatization.
Sit down.
They're making
Mr. Mullett head of OFFPOL.
Anyway, I want you to do something for me.
You know my usual question, Mr Frost.
Yes, I know.
What's in it for me?
Right, this is the big one.
We get this right and we'll catch this blackmailer, this sadist.
This murderer.
We get it wrong,
Bobby Kirkby will be killed.
So everything's got to be a hundred percent.
Now then.
This is the mark.
Sir Richard Cordwell of
Cordwell Supermarkets.
Tactics, discreet surveillance, that means the blackmailer mustn't know we're there and Sir Richard mustn't know we're there, otherwise the operation is aborted.
Now then, we start tailing Sir Richard the moment he leaves his house.
He'll probably drive to the supermarket in his roller.
Collier will be in the store in radio communication, watching the public telephones.
Now our man will make contact through those phones at 8 o'clock.
Now they're all tapped and linked into Control.
Is that right, Don?
Right, guv.
Good.
George, you're waiting outside the car park entrance.
You take over from Burton.
Other cars will be in the area.
You shouldn't have any trouble following the car because of the tracer.
Cordwell's approaching the supermarket.
Okay, Jack.
I've got him now.
He's here, sir.
Something's happening.
Oh, no, I've lost him.
Collier, what's happening?
Okay, I'm in household goods and I'm heading towards the delicatessen.
I've got him.
He's on the phone at the customer services desk.
Cunning sod.
He's not using the public kiosk.
He's moving again.
Into the back of the store.
All right, all right, don't worry, Collier.
He'll be out in a minute with the money.
Toolan, stand by in the front car park.
Jack!
I want a word.
Not now sir, please!
I hope this operation doesn't depend on Tommy Dunstan planting a tracer.
Why?
Dunstan's just got himself detained for stealing two bottles of whiskey from his employer.
It's all right sir, the tracer is still working.
All right, Collier, where are you?
Collier come in.
Collier?
Collier, come in, will you.
What's happening?
Sorry guv,
I lost reception in the back carpark.
He's gone sir, but he's carrying a bag and he's changed cars.
What?
Light colored
Vauxhall Monteray, index number N760 EUA.
Why isn't the tracer moving?
Bloody hell!
Tommy, you prat!
See what happens when you use rubbish like Dunstan?
Well it's too late to worry about that now, sir.
Burton, where are you?
Bath Road, sir.
Heading south.
Any sightings?
No, sir.
Toolan?
Driving out of the front car park now.
Come on, Brady, you take over.
It's a monumental cock-up isn't it, Jack.
What are you doing now?
Well, I'm going to go down there.
Liz are you coming?
What good will that do?
I have no idea.
Where are we going, sir?
Well, where else would you go for a handover, or a leg over, come to that.
Denton Woods.
Is this another hunch?
Yes.
Well what else have we got?
All right so I screwed up.
I shouldn't have used Tommy Dunstan.
Hornrim Harry was right.
But then again he should have given us more mobiles.
Guv, we've found him!
He just passed Burton on Sandown Road.
Burton's on his tail now, heading for Denton Woods.
I told you darling.
All right, what's occurring?
He's out of the car.
Has he done the drop yet?
He must have made it already, the bag's gone.
He's moving back to the car.
Could we go in closer?
It's open ground, anybody waiting there would see you.
If he's here, he'd have to be in those trees.
What's that?
Over there?
Very good, sir.
It's a car.
Lights are out.
All the cars in those trees have got their lights out.
They don't come on again until they're looking for the girls' knickers afterwards.
Is there anyone in it?
Inspector.
Another car.
Oh, yes.
Can you see what the index number is on it?
I can't get it from here.
Come on, we'll have to get closer then, won't we.
Got it.
Check car index K446 WFT
Someone's getting out.
What's he got, a gun?
No, I don't think it's a gun.
I don't believe it.
He's exercising his pooch.
He'll drive the kidnapper away.
It must be him.
Why doesn't he come out again?
The index.
Henry Alan Finch.
14 Lincoln Avenue, Denton.
We're checking his record on the computer.
Maybe he's got another car and he's gone out the other side.
He's clean.
Record's clean.
Oh come on, let's go and take a look.
What's that?
There's someone there.
It's all right.
Call for an ambulance, quick!
Ambulance to Denton Heath, off Forest Row, Sarge.
It's all right, don't worry, you'll be all right.
Where's the bag?
Must have gone.
Bloody hell, it's that escort.
Where's the radio?
Message to all mobiles.
I want to talk to the occupants of a ford escort,
Iightish coloring,
Ieaving Denton Heath by the way of Forest Row.
Got an index, Jack?
It's got four wheels and two red lights at the back.
Is that all right?
Probably got two people inside.
Jack, this is Mullett.
What the hell's going on?
Everything's under control, sir.
Just a slight hiccup.
Well you'd better come and see me first thing.
You silly, stupid, bastard.
Don't you understand traffic lights?
Yes, I'm sorry, love.
Are you drunk?
I'm calling the police.
I am the police.
I know you.
Sergeant Jack Frost.
Detective Inspector Frost.
No, go on.
Do I know you?
You ought to, you sod.
Number of times you've run me in.
It's Kitty.
Kitty Rayford.
Go on, tell me
I haven't changed a bit.
All right.
You haven't changed a bit.
I hope I haven't put a scratch on your nice big Bentley.
A scratch, you pig.
That's a thousand quid's worth of damage.
You what?
Oh, go on.
Have it on me.
I'll tell the insurance the other car didn't stop.
You're an angel, Kitty.
I owe you a few favors.
Mr. Finch.
Who are you?
I'm a police woman.
Detective Sergeant Maude.
Where's my dog?
At the station.
Being looked after.
How are you Mr. Finch.
I'm fine.
They're just keeping me in overnight for observation.
I'll be home in the morning.
What were you doing on
Denton Common tonight?
Doing?
I was taking the dog for a run.
You were attacked, sir.
We need to know what happened.
We saw you draw up in the car.
You saw me?
What were you doing there?
It's lucky we were, sir.
You could have died of pneumonia.
You didn't get out of the car right away?
It was pouring.
I didn't want to disappoint Pippa.
Pippa?
The dog.
So you threw the ball about.
Tossed it into the bushes.
She wouldn't go after it.
I put her back in the car and I went to look for the ball.
It was her favorite you see.
Then I saw a holdall, in the bushes, brand new it was.
So I decided to take it home and give it to the police in the morning.
Suddenly this lout appeared out of the blue.
Hit me over the head with a brick or something.
There, that's better.
All right, thank you.
It's a nice place you've got here, Kitty.
You've done well.
Yeah.
And to think you once run me in for keeping a disorderly house.
You're not still at it, are you?
Different branch really.
I got married.
Except he's gone.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He was very old.
Yeah, well,
I know the feeling.
I'm getting past it myself, but I keep going.
Don't be so bloody sorry for yourself.
I'm not.
I was once, but
I'm not any more.
Cor blimey, look at this coffee.
I've seen better stuff running out of stables.
Get it down you.
You had a shock.
I couldn't send you back to your wife in that state.
You'd have a job, Kitty.
She's dead.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Must be lonely without her.
It was lonely with her, to tell you the truth.
You poor old sod.
You know you can stay here if you like.
I beg your pardon?
If you're going deaf,
Jack, forget it.
I don't sleep with deaf men.
It's DS Maude here in the interview room.
Tell DI Frost, Mr. Finch is looking at mugshots.
Grim gallery, aren't they?
Ah, there he is, that's him.
You're positive?
Absolutely positive.
Thank you, Mr. Finch.
You wait here and I'll go and check him out.
Jack!
Yes.
Sir Richard has been on the phone all morning.
You might like to know that he's going to go ahead with his press conference at 12 o'clock.
Only now he intends to tell the whole world about last night's police fiasco.
It's not a fiasco.
May I remind you the boy hasn't been released and is presumably in the greatest danger.
Look, this old bloke turned last night up with his dog and interrupted the kidnapper.
It's all right.
He's made a positive identification.
And we'll be making an arrest shortly.
Sir, erm...
It's all right, carry on.
Well, there's a slight complication, sir.
The man Mr. Finch positively identified, he's in the remand centre at Bicester been there for the past two weeks.
Typical Jack isn't it.
Just typical.
I'm so sorry I could have sworn it was him.
If it wasn't it was someone very like him.
Unfortunately the Courts don't like look-alikes.
For some reason they insist on the real thing.
I'm so sorry.
Come on.
Don't worry, we'll catch him.
When you do give me a shout,
I'd be glad to identify him.
Yeah, or someone very much like him.
Er, Jack...
Yeah.
Sir, the Stansfield case, do you mind if I put a tail on Grafton?
No, it's fine by me but you better check it out with Mullett first.
By the way, has Mullett mentioned anything to you about promotion?
No, sir.
Jack, there's someone here to see you.
I know I told Princess Di not to bother me at work.
Interview room one.
Tommy Dunstan.
Right.
Thank you.
Well you dropped me right ruddy well in it didn't you.
What happened to you last night?
A silly mistake.
I'd come in without my wallet and suddenly remembered
I needed a couple of bottles of scotch, you know how it is Jack.
Yes, I know how it is.
I should have known better.
Look, you're in with old Cordwell.
Can't you get him to drop the charges?
Me in with Cordwell?
He wants my private parts on a plate.
What do you want to talk to me about anyway?
Listen Jack, I've got something on him you might be able to use as a lever.
Do you remember those forged tens and twenties we had in town about a year back?
Well, what about them?
Cordwell got lumbered.
About forty thousand quid.
Three days peak trading.
Anyway, the bank called to say we were taking forgeries.
Cordwell checked his safe and went berserk.
I'm glad it had a happy ending.
Oh, no, he shoves it back in the safe, swears all the staff to secrecy.
Mouth shut or it's the chop.
Since then he's been passing small amounts through all the branches.
It goes in the tills and comes out in the customers' change.
Tricky Dicky Cordwell.
I bet there was some in the ransom money wasn't there?
About twenty thousand quid.
I was on security duty when he made it up.
We might both be off the hook, Tommy.
I'd still bake a cake with a file in it, though.
Just in case.
I didn't expect to see you here.
I thought you'd be going through the Help Wanted ads.
You obviously get very well paid for screwing things up.
You ruined that operation.
May we have a word in private, Sir Richard?
Why, has something happened?
Yes it has.
I'll be with you in a moment, Fiona.
Get in the car.
Caught the kidnapper?
Got Bobby Kirkby back?
No, sir, not yet.
You're wasting my time.
You blew it.
You mounted an inadequate surveillance operation against your promise.
You put cars on my tail and you let the kidnapper get away.
Now because he knows the police are involved he won't release the boy.
I hope your conscience is hurting.
Maybe there's another reason why the kidnapper failed to keep his side of the bargain.
Maybe he didn't want to be paid in forged notes.
You're a bastard, Frost.
Takes one to know one.
I presume you're inviting me to buy my way out?
Yes.
All right, how much?
Cancel your press conference.
Drop all charges against Tommy Dunstan and let me have all the information on those forged notes.
You'll be please to know that all the furs and jewelry were over insured.
So I still think it's Stansfield.
I still think you're wrong.
Jack?
Some of that funny money's turned up.
Six thousand five hundred pounds paid in.
Over a thousand in duds.
Bloke traded in a gray Ford Escort.
Bought a new set of wheels and gave a false address.
Car's been spotted on Whitemoor Estate.
Burton's waiting there.
Look at it sir, up there.
It's about as subtle as a stripper in a monastery.
Any idea where the owner lives?
On a street like this, you just grab a vacant space.
Better be careful, sir.
If he has got Bobby, we could end up with a hostage situation.
All right, leave it to me.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
Is this your car, sir?
'Course it's my bloody car.
Good.
I'm a police officer.
All right, come on, let's have him.
Go get him, go.
Come on, come on.
Get this crazy cow off me!
All right, son, all right, all right, calm down.
Let's get him inside, come on.
Right, come on!
I don't want this recorded.
Now wait a minute.
First thing.
Simple question.
Where's Bobby Kirkby?
I'm not wasting my breath.
I've been here all afternoon answering the same bloody questions.
All right.
Leave the room, constable.
Sir?
Get out!
Now isn't this cozy?
Just the three of us.
Sergeant.
Do you recognize these two lads?
No.
I'll help you.
This one is Bobby Kirkby, the boy you kidnapped.
And this one is Dean Anderton, the boy you killed.
Look, I've already told you!
All right, now listen!
I've been up on Denton
Heath half the night.
And I'll tell you how I think it went, shall I?
You kidnapped one of those boys and you killed the other.
Then you sent a ransom note, and last night you went to
Denton Heath to collect.
Unfortunately some poor old boy got in the way, so you clumped him one and snatched the money.
And you thinking the money was untraceable, you went on a spending spree.
But what you didn't know was, we had a list of all the serial numbers.
So we've got you bang to rights and I'm tired of listening to your lies so much so that I'm not even bothering to record them.
All right.
All right.
Look, I was there at Denton Heath.
I was with a girl.
Right.
Now we're getting somewhere.
You expect me to believe you went to
Denton Woods last night in that foul weather for a bonk.
Well, Cindy's a married woman, Inspector.
Look, we saw a car stop and a bloke nip out with a bag and hide it in the bushes.
I thought I'd have a look.
You didn't get out straight away.
You took a long time.
Well, it took
Cindy a long time, if you know what I mean?
And when I went to where the bag was, there was an old bloke ferreting about, he was looking for something.
And he picked up the bag from the bushes.
I tried to grab it but he put up a bit of a fight.
So I hit him with a lump of wood and snatched the bag.
And then I saw all that cash.
Well, I couldn't believe my luck.
And I don't know anything about them.
You see the night they were snatched,
I was working as a barman, about fifty people could give me an alibi.
Well, it's not him, he's too stupid.
Let's go through it again, eh?
Kidnappers motives?
All right.
He kidnaps a kid in order to hold to ransom a supermarket.
The kid dies, so what does he do?
He calmly goes out and gets another one.
Why?
Why didn't he just hide Dean and then pretend he was still alive?
He needed a boy alive to make the appeal to Sir Richard.
Yes, yes, that's right, that fits.
He needed a finger.
He needed a crying boy to tug at Cordwell's heartstrings.
If he'd got any.
Wait a minute, we've got another problem now, so the demands are met, right, but he doesn't turn up to pick up the money.
Why?
Something prevented him?
Must have been late in the day though, mustn't it.
Five minutes earlier he was on the phone to Cordwell.
Maybe, the money's not important?
Maybe the aim is to get at the supermarket.
Or he spotted us.
Wouldn't have been hard after Finch turned up.
All right.
Maybe there is another possibility that's staring us in the face?
Maybe the kidnapper did turn up, and someone snatched the money from him.
What do you mean, Finch?
The old man with the dog?
Yeah.
Think about it.
It's peeing down with rain,
I mean what person in his right mind goes out and chucks a ball for a dog?
Come on, Jack.
Lots of people are methodical, that doesn't make them kidnappers.
Yes, but most people don't throw a ball where half a million quid in cash is stashed, do they?
Which reminds me.
Just a second.
What did Hudson say in his statement?
It said..., yeah.
It said 'there was this old bloke ferreting about looking for something'.
Looking for something.
The dog's ball.
No, no, no.
When we found Finch he had the ball in his pocket.
So what was he looking for?
The money.
Thank you, my darling.
The money.
All right, if it is him how do we play it.
Long and slow.
Can't afford long.
He's killed one kid already.
He'll think nothing about killing another.
He doesn't seem to give a damn about kids.
All he seems to be interested in is blackmailing Cordwell.
Why?
Would he be strong enough to do it though.
I mean I've seen his hospital case notes, he's terminally ill.
He's got an inoperable tumor.
Maybe he's got a score to settle?
With the supermarket.
While he's still able.
Well, let's get a warrant and search his house.
No, no, no.
The kid won't be there.
Finch is a clever bastard.
Why do you think he stripped Dean Anderton?
So that he wouldn't leave a clue, even a shower cap, so that there wouldn't be a hair to trace him.
No, this is going to need a lot of tact and subtlety.
Doorbell.
Ah, someone there.
Good afternoon, Mr. Finch.
Hello, I was just going out.
All right, yes.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've had a bit of luck.
We've caught the man who attacked you and stole the bag.
Oh glad to hear it.
How can I help you?
Well, you did say that you would be able to identify him.
Has he admitted kidnapping that poor young boy?
No, no, no he hasn't.
He's been lying his head off.
He said he came across the bag by chance and you tried to take it away from him.
That's ridiculous.
He hit me and put me in the hospital.
Yeah, well, I know,
I know that and you know that, but there is just one other thing.
I hope you don't mind and I know it's a bloody cheek but could I have a look round your house?
Why would you want to do that?
Well, you see, this man, he denies all knowledge of the kidnapping and what he's saying is, he's saying that you were there with the express purpose of collecting the ransom money.
Absurd.
I came across that bag purely by chance.
Yes I know sir, but you see, the thing is that when I get him to court, his brief is going to want to know why I didn't search your house to see if the boy was hidden there.
I suppose you have some kind of warrant?
Well, actually I didn't think it warranted a warrant.
If you see what I mean.
The thing is,
I don't take it seriously, but would you mind?
It'll just take a couple of minutes.
All right, come in.
Thank you very much.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, so what have we got here?
Bathroom.
This would be the lounge here, would it, sir?
Yes.
Yes, all right.
And what, kitchen through there?
Excuse me, Inspector.
Yes?
Message from the station.
They want to hold the identity parade right away.
I'm busy, Lambert.
Can't it wait five minutes?
They've got the men lined up, sir.
Mr. Finch,
I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind going along with this police officer in his car?
I'll follow along in a couple of minutes.
Car's waiting, sir.
You will lock the front door properly when you go out?
Yes, of course I will, sir.
Thank you.
All right, come on, let's have you.
All right now don't forget,
I want you to be absolutely thorough and put everything back in it's place.
Finch mustn't know that we've been here.
And what you're looking for, you're looking for anything that would prove that the kid was here.
You're looking for hair, you're looking for fibre, you're looking for blood.
Burton, don't forget we're also looking for a cassette recorder, we're looking for a computer printer and we're also looking for a bottle of chloroform.
So if any of... what's that, that's a computer isn't it?
Sorry sir, that's the wrong kind.
This is a daisy wheel.
It would be.
Listen, he'll be getting suspicious,
I'd better be off.
Now don't forget, put everything back in its place and close the door behind you, there's a good boy.
All right come on then everyone,
Iet's get at it.
Guys we haven't got very long here.
Sorry I'm late.
I had a radio call on the way back.
So, how did you get on with the identity parade?
They haven't held it.
I'm not impressed with your efficiency.
No, no, I'm sure you're not, sir.
Sergeant, check that out for me will you?
Thank you.
Did you find anything?
At your house?
No.
I didn't really expect to.
I closed the door after me as you requested.
Good.
Yes?
Sir, it seems the identity parade won't be necessary.
Hudson's signed his statement saying he assaulted
Mr. Finch and took the money.
And the kidnapping?
Did he admit to that?
No, he didn't.
In fact he had an alibi.
Oh, dear.
Well, that's that.
Oh, Mr. Finch.
I wonder if you'd mind going with the
Detective Sergeant here and identify the holdall for me?
You mean that's all?
Yes, yes that's all.
You've been very helpful.
Detective Sergeant Maude here will give you a lift home.
A rather wasted afternoon, wasn't it Mr. Frost?
Come on Pippa.
Come on.
Burton?
It's Frost.
Did you find anything at Finch's.
He's still in the building.
Nothing sir, it's clean.
No sign the boy's ever been here.
All right, get everyone out of there.
Right, guv.
Come on everyone, out now.
I know it's Finch.
He's got that boy.
He hasn't got him in the house.
That's why he's so ruddy cool.
Perhaps he's got an accomplice?
What Finch?
No, he's a loner.
He's got that kid somewhere near.
Even if he's bound and gagged, he's got to feed him, hasn't he?
Jack, forget this Bobby Kirkby case for one night.
And I'll make you a really good dinner.
Here, put the telly on.
Yeah, all right.
Ah, Jack.
There are going to be some big changes in this Division.
Why, are they moving you on, sir?
No, they are not moving me on.
Have you seen these?
Have you got any leads left at all, Jack?
We're being pilloried.
Don't worry about being pilloried.
The trouble with this is it just makes more work.
There'll be hundreds more sightings and it'll just rattle the kidnapper.
That's the last thing we need.
Do I have your permission to continue to follow Finch?
Finch?
You've been over that man's house with a tooth comb and his car.
Any more pressure on Finch and he'll have you for police harassment.
I know he did it.
You do not.
You think you do.
Well you'd better be right, otherwise you'll be in even more trouble.
Thank you.
And don't you go using police resources without my permission!
No, sir.
And I'm expecting some developments in the Stansfield case.
Stansfield.
Yes, sir.
Ah, Collier.
I'm expecting developments in the Stansfield case.
Anything on Ian Grafton?
No sir.
Not since he had that new sound system delivered.
New sound system?
He's on the dole!
Why didn't you tell me he was spending money?
I did, sir.
I left a report on your voice mail.
Voice mail?
Have I done something wrong, guv?
Done something wrong.
Sergeant Maude!
Dear, oh dear.
Leave the door.
Thank you.
Oh yes, that's it.
All right, sit.
All right.
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Who the hell do you think you are?
He's a police inspector.
Yes, that's right Carole.
And these are your friends?
Well, well, well, what have we got here,
Iook at this.
I see that you've all shopped
'till you dropped haven't you?
Who are you?
I'm Tracey Neal.
And you're Carole's best friend from school.
Yeah, how did you know that?
It's called intuition, Tracey.
Something I've been suffering from since I met Carole.
All right, come on
Iet's have a look round.
Shouldn't you two both be at school?
We didn't feel like it.
It's boring.
Is there anything wrong with us playing music?
Only not when I'm talking.
Sir?
What?
Well, what have we got here, eh, oh, look at this, daddy's money, or what's left of it.
I suppose this was your idea was it, Mr. Grafton?
No, it wasn't.
It was Carole's idea.
We just went along for a laugh.
Oh, really.
Right, well, come on Carole,
I'm taking you home, see if your mum and dad find it funny.
No, no
I'm not going!
Come on, Carole!
You did what?
I don't understand.
Why would she want to rob her own parents?
Why Carole, why?
I gave you everything.
We were worried sick about what happened to you that night.
So come on then, what did happen?
Go on, Sergeant.
Explain it.
Carole's friends
Ian Grafton and Tracey Neal, broke in here to make it look like a real burglary and took Carole to
Denton Woods in Ian's van.
Then Ian followed you to the bank and watched you get the money.
You knew I'd get the money.
It wasn't just for that.
It was so there'd be an alibi.
Ian wanted to get a parking ticket.
To show it couldn't have been his van I was being held in.
Why did you dump my jewelry and furs?
Didn't know what else to do with them.
Ian said we'd get caught if we tried to sell them.
Then what the hell did you take them for.
To spite you, you dumb bitch.
Oh, you wicked...
I didn't rob from my parents.
She's not my real mother.
And he gives her everything, clothes, and furs, and jewelry.
She only married him for his money.
Why should she get it all.
What about me!
What about you!
What about you!
What about the stealing...
Calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down!
Hello, Mr. Finch.
Oh, you again.
Yes, it's me again
Hello Pippa.
Glad I've seen you.
I was hoping you might be able to help me with my little problems.
Oh?
What problems are those?
Well, I'm looking for a very clever kidnapper who went to a lot of trouble to hold Cordwell's stores to ransom.
He asked for half a million pounds.
The trouble was, the other night, he didn't turn up to pick it up.
I wonder, why do you think that was?
I have no idea.
Two people did turn up that night.
One was a Mr. Hudson and the other was you.
Now Mr. Hudson has got an alibi for the night of the kidnapping.
Where were you?
I was at home that night.
But you took
Pippa for a walk.
I always walk the dog.
Mr. Finch, do you recognize these two boys.
No, no.
I don't.
Very ruthless man, this kidnapper.
Now, look, if you have anything at all to tie me to this crime, please charge me.
If you haven't,
Ieave me alone.
Come on Pippa.
All right, come on.
This is it.
Make or break.
Strip everything.
Peel the wallpaper off if necessary.
But find me something somewhere that takes me to that kid.
Sir?
Yes?
Hello, I say Hello?
Who are you people?
Are you a gang?
No, no, it's all right, madam.
Don't worry we're the police.
That's Mr. Finch's house.
He isn't in any kind of trouble, is he?
No, no, not at all.
He's given us permission to look round.
I live next door.
We like to keep an eye on each other round here.
Very good.
That's very commendable.
You live here, do you?
Yes, that's right.
I wonder, would you mind if I popped in to see you for a moment.
Oh no, of course not.
Thank you.
So, you've got no idea where Mr. Finch may have gone?
Oh, I know scarcely anything about him.
He's a very private man.
But I used to chat with his wife, often, of course, that stopped when she died.
Yes, well of course it would, wouldn't it.
You know she killed herself, took an overdose.
That was after she lost her job at the supermarket.
The supermarket?
Oh, yes.
She had a very good post as accounts lady at Cordwell's.
But they dispensed with her services about a year ago.
She died soon after.
They say he never got over it.
Oh do move Braveheart if she's in your way.
Braveheart?
Oh, dear.
I do hope she hasn't been naughty.
She has a touch of flatulence.
Oh, is that what it is?
She's not selfish with it, is she?
How does she get on with Mr. Finch's dog?
Oh, that's not
Mr. Finch's dog.
He's looking after it for friends, while they're away on holiday.
Is he really.
Burton, where are you?
Lounge, sir.
All right, did you see the neighbors?
What did you chat about, the weather?
Anything?
No, nothing, sir.
All right, carry on.
Listen, holiday postcards, have you seen any?
There's one on the mantelpiece, actually.
Dear Harry.
Benidorm is wonderfully hot and we pity you shivering away in Denton.
Yes, do pay the milk bill for us and we'll settle up next week.
Edie and Wilf.
Please pay the milk bill, what does that mean?
It means they want him to pay the milk bill.
Yes, but why would Finch pay their milk bill?
He's looking after their house, while they're on holiday.
Exactly, an empty house, a key.
An address book?
Didn't find one.
There must be loads of Edie and Wilfs.
Yeah, you're right.
See if you can find an address book,
I'm going to have a word with Mrs. Way.
Oh, there you are,
I was just coming to have a word with you.
Oh.
Yes.
Could you tell me, do you know an
Edie and Wilf?
Edie and Wilf?
I've never heard of them.
What about Wilf and Edie?
Oh, Wilfred and Edith.
The Watkins.
A very nice couple.
Retired chemists, you know.
They live in Wrights Lane.
It's lovely round there.
You should go and have a look.
What's that noise?
Vacuum cleaner, but you wouldn't know about that.
You're probably right.
Who's there?
Police.
Just a minute...
Just a minute, come on, open up!
Ah, Mr. Frost, twice in one day.
Yes, I want to search these premises.
Still about that missing boy?
Yes, it's about the missing boy, Mr. Finch.
Then I waive my rights to demand a warrant.
Search where you like, but do wipe your feet.
All right, come on, let's go.
George?
And don't mind Pippa.
I've just been cleaning the place.
It belongs to friends who are coming back from Spain tomorrow.
But, what makes you think the boy might be here?
Because you are, Mr. Finch.
This is getting tedious, Mr. Frost.
Sir?
Up here, small bedroom.
There's a stain, sir.
Take a sniff.
Chloroform?
Might be.
Right.
Get forensic up here.
You'll find it's dry cleaning fluid.
The dog made a stain on the carpet.
I cleaned it, just now.
I see, what about the bedding.
In the washing machine.
Pippa slept on it.
Very tidy man, aren't you Mr. Finch?
Indeed, yes.
Sir?
Dot matrix printer in the study.
Thank you.
It matches the kind used for the ransom demand.
Can't prove it's the one, though.
Doesn't have a type face.
Just little pins.
Well what about the tape, Hammond?
Can't we examine it?
Oh, no, sir.
You see the ribbon is a continuous loop, so letters print over other letters.
It's impossible to unscramble.
And in any case, it's just been replaced.
All right.
Examine all the waste bins and the dustbin.
He's playing with us.
I know that boy was here up to a couple of hours ago.
Jack?
We've just found that.
Chloroform.
My friend ran a chemist shop.
I hope you're not suggesting he had anything to do with this.
I mean he's been in
Spain for a month.
You seem to find this rather amusing, Mr. Finch.
May I remind you that we are looking for a kidnapped boy who may be dead, and you are responsible.
All I find amusing is the time you're wasting.
I mean can you find one thing, one single thing that proves
I've had anything to do with this.
Get him to the station.
Well, anything?
No, nothing yet, sir.
Well?
Nothing, sir.
Hammond?
Come here a minute.
There's mud on this car tire.
Mud?
Is there really, sir.
Yes, there is, really.
Can we trace it?
I think for once we can, sir.
I'd say it comes from the lane outside.
If that's any help, sir?
About as helpful as you've been all day.
It's fresh.
Yes, it's very fresh, sir.
Thank you.
I'm sure he had that boy here, in this house, a couple of hours ago.
Then he can't be far, sir.
Is someone looking after Pippa, Mr. Frost?
Forget about the dog,
Finch, I care about the boy.
Where is he?
I've no idea.
This afternoon you went out in your friend's car.
Where did you go?
I went to get bread for Wilf and Edie.
And when you came back you washed it, didn't you?
And you cleaned it outside and in.
Why?
When I borrow things
I like to return them in good order.
You took that boy to
Denton Heath, didn't you?
Did I?
Really, Mr. Frost.
It won't be so funny when we find that boy.
I didn't know your wife worked for Cordwell.
I don't believe you asked.
No, I didn't.
How long was she there?
A working lifetime, Mr. Frost.
She was in the Accounts
Department, wasn't she.
Then she lost her job.
That must have upset her.
It devastated her.
That job was her life.
She gave up having children because of it.
She gave eighteen years of honest service.
And then she was fired.
She took an overdose.
But then modern merchandising is a cutthroat business, isn't it?
And cutthroat businesses cut throats.
You must have blamed
Richard Cordwell for her death.
Cordwell is a profiteer.
And in the course of building a shoddy empire is quite prepared to sacrifice human lives.
So are you, aren't you?
For revenge.
Inspector, when I lost my wife
I could have done anything.
Even committed physical violence.
But time has numbed the pain.
Besides, any hatred I felt could never have been satisfied by money.
Mr. Frost, now that my wife has gone, and I don't have long to live, so what would I do with the ransom?
Hello?
Sir?
All right.
I've got a little surprise for you.
I don't think you've met
Sir Richard Cordwell.
No, my wife has, of course.
My late wife, that is.
I trust that nothing we say here is to be recorded, Inspector.
All tapes removed.
All devices switched off?
Yes, you have my word.
Yes, I remember your word.
Now then, Mr. Finch.
I've looked up your wife's file.
At Cordwell's we employ a no whistle blowing policy.
That means we don't speak to our competitors or the press.
Eileen Finch was on the point of breeching that rule, when I asked her to leave.
My wife simply wished to warn the local media that there was forged money in the tills.
She was a very honest woman, Sir Richard.
Very well, one businessman to another.
What do you want to do about it?
Just a minute, just a minute!
We've got a missing boy out there, now where is he Finch!
You still seem to think
I'm the kidnapper, Mr. Frost.
Where's Bobby Kirkby?
If the kidnapper told you where the boy was, he'd seal his guilt.
And he wouldn't have achieved his intentions.
His intentions were to get Sir Richard Cordwell to part with some of that funny money so he could expose him.
But unfortunately it went wrong and he didn't pick it up.
Police incompetence, nothing to do with me.
But you did want the publicity didn't you, Sir Richard.
Always the man with the big smile.
Shopper's friend.
But you'd gladly rob the public and destroy an employee who gets in your way.
All right, Mr. Finch.
You want compensation.
I'm willing to settle.
You release the boy and I'll pay you half a million, and as much again to any charity you name and no publicity.
And all charges dropped?
All evidence destroyed?
I'll speak to my friend, the Chief Constable.
No you won't Sir
Richard Cordwell!
Sit down!
Now I'm sorry, but I've got a very strict superintendent.
Who makes me play by the rules, in case you're forgetting, we've got one dead boy already, and another one out there in danger.
Now, Mr. Finch,
I could ask the court to be lenient.
I could say that Dean's death wasn't intended and that you cooperated fully over Bobby Kirkby.
And you'd be out in say, five years.
I don't have five years.
Who's Dean?
Dean is the first boy you killed.
I've never killed anybody.
Awfully cold for the time of year, isn't it?
If Bobby Kirkby was out in this, he'd probably be dead by morning.
Where's Bobby Kirkby?
Only the kidnapper could tell you that.
If he kept his mouth shut, the boy would die and he'd walk free.
Do a deal, the boy lives, and he still walks free.
All right, Finch.
I'll make you a promise.
Whether I find the boy alive or dead
I'm gonna nail you.
Has he confessed yet?
No, he wanted to do a deal and I wouldn't.
So now he's prepared to let that little boy die just so that Cordwell won't come out on top.
They're two of a kind.
You know, something happened today, when we went to that house in Wrights Lane.
I'm sure it's important but I just can't put my finger on it.
What was it, what did we do?
What happened?
Go through it.
We rang the doorbell.
Finch was in the hallway with Pippa.
You said 'Police'.
He said, 'just a minute', he opened the door.
'Just a minute'...
'just a minute'... what did he do in that 'just a minute'?
Grab something?
Perhaps he hid something?
Okay, somewhere in this area.
Something that took just a few seconds.
If you wanted to hide something quickly, where would you hide it?
Behind the coat rack, sir?
Plate shelves?
All right.
Let's have a look.
Did anyone search these coats.
Should have done, sir?
I know they should have done, but did...did they?
What's this?
If they did, they would have found that this belonged to Finch.
There's a receipt here.
Hatter's Garage.
Petrol, dated today.
That'll do.
Well, what are we looking for?
Blue Volvo estate.
Probably a couple of hours ago.
There.
Hold it, that's it.
Is there anyone else in that car?
Can't tell.
This road runs past
Denton Mill, doesn't it?
Yeah, along the river.
Right.
Get hold of that tape.
Guard it like your grandmother's silver.
Liz get onto Control.
Get the search party moved to Denton Mill, don't tell Mullett.
Anything?
Nothing yet, guv.
Nothing, sir.
Keep looking.
Jack!
Who authorized all this?
Well I tried to phone you at home, sir, but no one answered.
I haven't been more than six foot from the phone all evening.
So Finch has told you where the boy is, has he?
Not exactly, no sir.
Jack!
Jack!
Down here.
Waders.
He's been in the water.
The hiding place is round here somewhere.
The boy must be here,
I'm sure of it.
All right.
George, give me that torch.
You search this side of the bank.
See if you can find a boat.
Burton, you come with me.
Jack, you'll drown yourself!
Yeah!
Anything for you, sir.
Shine your torch in here.
All right, come on.
Bobby?
Bobby Kirby?
Bobby, can you hear me?
What's there look.
What, that door?
Yeah, come here.
Get hold of this torch will you?
Shine them in there.
All right, I've got him.
He's here.
Hurry up, get some light here.
All right, come on.
It's all right, son.
Come on, all right, got him.
Come on hurry up, will you.
Let's get him in the boat.
Steady.
There you go, all right.
Is he alive?
Is he breathing?
Yes, sir, he's breathing.
Tell the medics!
Well, ehm... well done, Jack.
Oh, all right, thank you, sir.
I was thinking, this blanket that the kid was wrapped in,
I wondered if it could tell us anything?
What do you think?
Good point.
Burton, get this to forensic.
Yes sir, I was... eh Burton, sorry sir, I thought
I saw something just then, in the blanket.
It's a receipt.
Really?
Has it got a name on it, sir?
Hatter's Garage.
H. A. Finch.
Finch.
We've got him.
That's the evidence we need.
It ties him in with the kid.
Lucky we found it.
You framed me.
That petrol receipt.
You found it in my coat pocket at the house.
I didn't find it, it was my Superintendent.
But you planted it.
Mr. Finch, I know you think you're infallible, but that petrol receipt must have fallen out of your pocket when you wrapped the kid in the blanket and stuffed him in the drainage pipe.
Oh, no, no.
I drove to the river,
I hid the child.
Then I went to the petrol station, so how else could it have got there?
Well that's one of life's little mysteries.
Are you going to make an official complaint?
You'd lie your head off.
How well you know me.
You don't understand, do you Mr. Frost.
When Cordwell fired her, my wife wanted to go to the police.
But he told her if she did, he'd destroy my business.
So she didn't say a thing.
Just torn herself to pieces.
And I didn't know.
I didn't know any of this.
Until I read her last letter to me.
I do understand.
But to put that right you killed one little boy and you were prepared to let another one die.
So you'll forgive me if I don't lose any sleep.
Goodnight.
Mr. Finch.
This one is all right.
The animals...
I'm not sure.
This must be swapped.
Perhaps with that.
We'll try with this one there, can you try it?
All the family harvested the grapes
On the boy's head was pressed the juice of a grape.
It was the feast, banquets.
There was always the traditional Georgian musicians.
It's a shame, that the portrait of the actress
Marguerite  is in Spain.
You know the story, don't you?
Pirosmani fell in love with a singer of French music-hall, on tour in Tbilisi.
One morning outside his hotel, he had the square covered with flowers for her waking.
A lady came, she is waiting for you at the restaurant, you will recognize her easily, she smokes cigars.
- Sorry, I'll be back in ten minutes.
- Yes.
Can you carry it to the back?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
I love the cook.
Excuse me, Madam, do you who want to see me?
- Are you Anton Gogoladze?
- Yes.
Sit down.
A friend of mine told me about you.
A little wine?
So, you have just arrived from Tbilisi?
When do you begin your exhibition of Pirosmani?
Tomorrow.
I wanted to meet you because I have something to show you.
Do you know this book?
If I know it?
I saw it throughout my childhood on the kitchen dresser.
So did I, this is a family souvenir.
My uncle Pascal wrote it.
Was Pascal Ichak your uncle?
My name is Marcelle Ichak, but you can call me Marcelle.
When I was a child, I was often ill.
My mother used to prepare me cakes.
Mostly fruit tarts, delicious.
This book was... my mother's Bible.
Your mother's name was
Cecilia Abachitdzé, wasn't it?
Yes.
I have manuscripts written by Pascal Ichak during his stay in Georgia.
- Would you like to see them?
- He talks a lot about your mother.
Ichak Pascal spoke of my mother?
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen...
Dad, why do you always say it is sweet when it is sour?
That's how he writes his recipes.
They are like poems.
No, I prepare a cake for Anton.
What?
Do you want the end of the turkey?
My God! Zigmund!
- What's wrong with you?
- I'll cut your throat!
Anton! Dad has gone crazy!
He thinks I am a turkey!
Why Zigmund?
I've had enough of your Pascal Ichak!
What may be in this?
That's so old.
Pictures.
Papers.
An old program, a drawing.
It's funny.
"During the harvest, in a small village called Moukouzani,
Princess Cecilia Abashidze, who accompanied me..."
Read by yourself.
"I am traveling through Georgia searching for new tastes, unknown Georgian dishes, exquisite wines.
I go to weddings, harvests and village festivals."
What?
- It lasted all night!
- So what?
He is old!
He is French! French!
Come here.
Come over here!
- Where are you going?
- Wait!
- What are you doing?
- Wait!
Long life!
My dear boy!
Long life!
May God be with us!
Are you going to kill it?
Oh no, let it go!
Let it go!
Skewers are delicious!
Thank you!
- Hello!
- Hello!
Add some more!
That one too!
Give me that!
Help me!
My Captain.
Marcelle.
- Yes?
- I came across the first meeting.
Great wine.
Great French wine.
Mouton-Rothschild, 1910.
Aroma.
Subtle.
Do you want to taste it?
I am lucky, it's my favourite wine.
What's more, it is a great year.
You speak French.
And if we imagined a little something to eat... to bring him out.
Give me 5 minutes.
All right, I need 5 minutes.
5 minutes.
Bon appetit.
I know you
It was during a cruise on the river Nile, you have probably forgotten me.
I was a little girl.
Don't worry.
I know you were only a ballroom dancer, a kind of gigolo.
You appealed much to my mother.
She said he is not handsome, but he is so French.
May your mother be thanked for it.
Did you often work on the Nile?
I was mainly on large ships.
New York, London, New York.
Were you dancing?
I made love.
And what do you do now?
Right now I'm sitting in front of a very pretty woman, and I ask myself, where is she going all alone?
Home.
Please convey my greetings to your mother.
But I no longer live at my parents'.
I earn my living, I work.
I live alone, and I'm bored.
I am a gourmet photographer.
I cook and I photograph my artwork.
It's a nice job.
The hardest thing is the temptation.
Could you move a little the umbrella?
That's it.
It's time to sit down to have dinner.
It's very delicate.
Anton.
I have an offer for you.
You translate everything that is written in Georgian, and I pay you for that.
Whatever you want.
It would be a pleasure, but... with the exhibition,
I don't know if I'll have time.
You can settle here, it does not bother me at all.
Look, what's written here?
A life and recipes.
And down here?
Walks with a great cook.
You have no idea of what you are losing,
Marcelle, it's delicious.
Read.
- Does one say, "to have a passion"?
- Yes.
Pascal had a true passion for great classical music.
He even said to have attended the Conservatory of Lyon.
But it's true.
During the winter of 1920, he sang at the opera of Koutaici
Listen Pascal, what's the point of singing your air before the duel?
This is the only aria I sing.
Today we have to end the opera earlier.
We are the guests of honor at a wedding in the countryside.
This will be a beautiful wedding.
They brought especially for us some Astrakhan caviar.
And we will be served iced vodka!
Today we come on stage in silence with guns.
I shoot. Pan!
We save thirteen minutes!
And we can catch the train!
What about my aria?
Leave it!
But I invited the princess Abashidze.
She'll hear me for the first time.
You'll sing for her in bed!
I want to sing.
It's starting!
We shoot without your aria!
Where did you run away,
O golden days of my spring.
What does the future hold for me?
In vain...
I look around for it.
It hides in the deep darkness.
Whatever, the law of fate is just.
Will I succumb drilled by an arrow...
Chase him out.
I challenge you to a duel.
A duel?!
Do you think you're D'Artagnan!
- You have the choice of weapons.
- Perhaps... with guns?
Guns!
Why not axes?
Axes!
Or bricks?
Bricks!
Stop! Stop!
Please!
A duel is a duel.
This is your place.
Take your brick.
Get ready!
In Venice
He screamed his serenades on the Grand Canal.
Did he?
The gondoliers were so outraged, they wanted to drown him.
What a character!
Stop!
- What are you doing?
- I am photographing the silence.
What a bizarre country.
Whenever I'm in beautiful countryside, either there is a church, or there is a fiesta.
Anyway, there is always a pretty woman.
Coming, coming!
- Marcelle?
- I'm here.
Come into the kitchen.
- Hello.
- Do you know how to use a computer?
A little.
Try it.
Go quick!
Take care of everything!
Eh! Come in, come in!
This way!
Whatever your appetite!
You must try our piglet!
It is a treat.
We will roast it nicely ripe!
Come in, come in!
Get the car in!
No, I'm interested in that.
It's beautiful!
Oh that's right!
Lobio!
May I introduce you to our host's son, his name is Zigmund.
Gogoladzé.
Darling!
- Marcelle.
- Yes.
- You know what I have just read?
- No.
I have just read that my father was a cook in a country inn.
- So what?
- But it's impossible.
Young, he was preparing the revolution.
Haven't the innkeepers the right to be revolutionary?
I feel as if I've gnawed my rubber boot.
And yet we heard them squealing behind the hedge.
You will see our piglets are exquisite!
Enter, you will enjoy it!
Even that.
Enter! I take care of you right now.
Please enter, enter!
Stick him well, go ahead!
Good bye! Come back often!
It will always a pleasure to see you again!
You especially.
- What did he say?
- Nothing, I'll always be welcome here.
- Translate word for word what I say.
- Calm down, what's happening to you?
You are pigs.
Mr. Ichak says that you are pigs.
- Put it down quickly.
- Put it down, quick!
- He turned mad?
- Do whatever he tells you!
In the car.
- He's crazy!
- He's French!
He'll see!
It's all right.
I raise my glass to our great trade!
To our trade.
I see you are honoring our koupati.
He is a gourmet and he knows the Georgian cooking.
It's the only place where the koupati is prepared this way.
But only a real gourmet could guess what they are stuffed with.
Can you guess what's inside?
Pheasant.
It is aerial.
And yet...
There's a touch of harshness, of bestiality.
There's a touch of harshness.
Everything is there.
Nutmeg.
Red pepper.
Half a glass of wine.
And liver.
Yes, the liver, but of what?
Not a word not a word
I will say it.
Bear liver.
This is fantastic
This is where I live.
Here are your luggage.
Darling, there is a bomb in the room.
How do you know?
The smell of powder, of magnesium.
I can even tell you where it is.
Under Mr. Chotana's chair.
Then, we must do something.
If I get up, and head towards the President's seat, they will think I am a terrorist.
There is a bomb under the President's seat.
- How?
- There is a bomb.
How do you mean, a bomb?
The President's life is in danger!
There is a bomb!
What about your guards,
Mr. President?
They don't go with me to the opera.
I am a specialist in defusing explosive devices.
Let me...
He looks like the guy of the inn.
- Go with the President.
- Come please.
After you.
What are you doing here?
Is it over?
Yes, the show is over, the bomb did not explode!
How are you?
- Well!
- "Well". Bravo, bravo!
I have to show you something.
Thank you very much.
This horn contains five liters of wine.
These are the names of the champions who emptied the horn in one gulp.
Did you see, Alexandre Dumas.
He is the eighth on the list.
Dumas came in the Caucasus in 1858.
He was the Prince Abashidze's host.
In your house Madam.
Among the heaviest drinkers, he was the only one to empty it in one gulp.
That was real French.
When can I try?
Tomorrow.
Mr. Pascal, opening a restaurant in Tbilisi is a beautiful idea.
But why in Tbilisi and not in Paris or Nice?
This is a reason
I would like...
I would like to know.
I fell in love with Georgia,
Mr. President.
Thank you.
Long live...
Ladies and gentlemen!
''Better not eat than to eat without appetite!''
''Take care of your appetite as you do of your loves!''
Yesterday I read a book of French cooking, that's where I borrowed these sentences.
The author of these words is talented with a wonderful smell.
I propose a toast to my French friend,
Mr. Pascal, be happy.
To our French friend!
Alexandre Dumas, now let's fight it out!
Fragrance of vanilla, rich, wine of the region of Bouzcani
Moukouzani!
Harvest of 1909.
- I forgive you the killing of the pig.
- Thank you.
Raise your right hand.
You have planted a bomb again.
Already at the opera...
Your hands smelled gunpowder.
Thanks to the President, Pascal made the dream of his life come true, to open his own French restaurant, the Eldorado.
The president himself came to inaugurate it.
I greet you gentlemen!
I greet you!
Enter our French host's place!
Welcome Mr. President in this restaurant, which is,
I must say, the dream of my life.
When a ship goes to sea for the first time,
I know one breaks a bottle of champagne.
But where should I break it here?
It's covered with mirrors.
I won't break a mirror!
Give me a bottle, I'll open it!
Mr. President!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Some elements of my menu.
You there, there.
Come on, sing, sing.
Align those glasses!
Pascal Ichak's French restaurant has become famous.
Many gourmets went there.
Labaz Chaliapin, Rapine Natagor
The Romanian pilot Tchichua and Sir Winston Churchill.
This is a saffron steamed sturgeon.
Duck with bitter almonds.
This is my favourite dish, smoked tongue.
This is a pheasant with pistachios.
Come and see.
The best awaits us in this hole.
The roast piglet.
I ate it all.
Pascal, I want a big belly.
A big belly?
Like the wife of the Consul of France.
I want one like that.
Look, I finish this and we go upstairs.
And why don't you marry me?
What's the point, I'm too old.
I forbid you to say that.
No, no, no, you can't do that.
- In Georgia, one always adds it.
- Yes, in Georgia, but I'm a French cook, then no one bothers me when I work.
You know what?
You're really old.
An old dictator in the kitchen.
Do not bother me.
What's left to me?
After I met you,
I became your little puppy.
Always behind you,
I smile at your guests.
Who am I?
You pump us into the luggage of great French chefs. (?)
- What's more, I am a hot-water bottle.
- A hot-water bottle.
A merry hot-water bottle to heat the great Mr. French cook.
Gentlemen!
Everyone is leaving, we must leave too.
They shoot in the street.
Did you see, they set fire to the restaurant of...
We inaugurated the Eldorado two years ago.
We have worked well.
This is not the revolution that worries me, it is my ice box which is not cold enough.
You know all those little Napoleon running in the street, killing, shooting, who consider themselves very important.
Where will they be tomorrow?
What is happening?
I am worried about you.
You could open a restaurant in Istanbul, Vienna, Paris.
I am a small passing cloud.
Then one day I hung on to the Caucasus Mountains.
I turned into rain, and I fell.
Now I cannot fly anymore.
I stay here.
Follow me!
Get up!
Fall in, quick!
Zigmund!
Attention!
Left!
Forward march!
Quick!
Right!
Forward march!
Bring the owner of the restaurant!
The Commander is coming!
Hi to you Comrade Commissar!
Get out!
Magnificent aquarium!
I want the fish fried!
They are 300 years old, they are not edible.
This one, this one and that one, fry them!
This wine has the color of the Revolution!
Let's drink to our victory!
Ichak.
It's been 2 years since we last met, hasn't it?
Where is my Thai fish?
Where are you going?
Hello!
This time, that's for sure, you will be mine!
But who is this beauty?
Zigmund!
Bring her to me.
Who are you my dear?
Princess Abashidze.
Princess?
Why this proud voice?
Don't you know that we hang the princes and the princesses, to telegraph poles!
Tell Vano to come with his dog.
- Vano, his dog?
- With his dog, Vano.
Quick!
I stay with you.
Go upstairs at once and shut the door.
Go, go!
Quick! Hurry!
Mr. General,
I cannot accept that you are served a dish that is not edible.
A dog wouldn't eat it.
I'm not your ''Mr.'', but Comrade Commissar Red!
I had to eat what a dog would not eat!
As for Kamo, my comrade in war for nine years, he has been eating shit!
Serve them!
It's you we're talking to!
Is there a cold room here?
There's one! A big one!
Ah, it is big?
Well! Go D'Artagnan!
In the cold room!
Put him there!
Soldiers! Come!
Nodar, take care of this! Hurry up!
Make way!
Let's leave.
I do not wear jewellery.
Who do you steal it from?
This is my wedding gift.
What are you saying, I'm married!
I'll kill your French lover with my own hands!
You won't do that!
- But before that...
- You won't!
Oh, and why not?
I will!
You too are cold?
Papa put his revolver in Mom's mouth.
Good!
Straighten to the left!
This is well!
It's all right, go, go.
- What shall I do of this meat?
- I don't care!
Get up! The wretched of the earth!
Get up! The prisoners of hunger!
Applaud!
This is a red wedding!
Pascal.
Pascal.
We should already be in Istanbul.
What do you need to understand?
You don't want to leave your restaurant.
But you can make cakes in your restaurant for my wedding.
And that does not bother you?
Be welcome Comrade Kolontai!
It's hot here.
In Moscow it's snowing!
Comrade Lenin asked me to come.
He got sick.
For me it is a pleasure.
I just love Georgia!
And especially men.
The famous ambassador from Moscow, the great Kolontai, came to Tbilisi for the celebrations of the revolution.
And asked to go to the sulfur baths.
Before the Revolution, I was wild!
Boy!
To my great surprise, she started talking about one of her former lovers,
Pascal Ichak.
She even knows our love story.
For her, all has to be shared between
Party comrades, especially good lovers.
She demanded an appointment with him and wanted to name him head chef of the Red Army in the Caucasus.
We were put on crowns of thorns.
We carried our heavy crosses on our Golgotha!
The day will come when they'll write about us the red gospel!
Our Christ is Lenin!
Wait for me here, until morning if necessary!
- Pascal.
- You.
Do you remember me?
I am...
Lili Chtelstein
- Kamarade Kolontai,
- Yes.
Mrs. Kolontai.
Princess Anne.
I am the German countess.
And you, the French baron.
General, my dear General!
Come, our chef has prepared the game!
Please, help yourself!
Stop!
Stop the car!
Don't look!
Bastard!
Pascal.
You did it on purpose?
I love you.
It is me who love you.
What have you done?
- You have eaten crows.
- Crows?
So Comrade General, how is your stomach?
Terrible, Comrade Kolontai, terrible!
We shit on ourselves!
My God, Pascal, what should I do now.
I'm gonna kill that French bastard!
This pig forced us to shit in public.
Come.
Zigmund!
Don't hurt him!
Don't touch him!
You promised me!
You promised me!
Come bastard!
Come, I'll stick your nose in...
You promised me!
Where are you going?
Good!
I like it, I take it!
Leave everything as it is!
Shall we take the French too?
The French?
In the attic.
In the attic!
How beautiful it is here!
It's like being in Paris!
Let's try!
This is vinegar!
Pascal.
I have orders not to let you get in here.
Don't come back!
But this is my restaurant.
It was, it was!
It's open.
I was in Baku.
It's getting from bad to worse.
You have to go away.
Do you remember of the (?) that you've knocked out with a pig?
Now he is chief of the political police.
You definitely have to leave.
Never.
Communism will disappear one day, good cooking won't.
I requested to ask for the Hapok meals.
Hapok?
Is it the Eldorado?
This is a decision of Moscow.
A new name for a new cooking.
I don't know what that means.
These smells are enough for me, thank you.
Moukouzani, 1900
My favourite year.
You promised me to bring a notebook.
Yes, I have it.
Write.
Dear Friend all day long
I inhale the smells of your remarkable cooking.
Having devoted to the culinary art most of my life
I allow myself to make a few remarks.
The Romanian aquin you prepared today would have been better if you had used spices and herbs with a little more generosity.
I won't remind you the basic principles.
Rosemary goes with mutton, saffron with fish, oregano with chicken, paprika with veal.
Regarding caloma,
I recommend to mix, to rub meat with a mixture of marjoram, cumin, and...
Ginger.
Hello!
I have a letter for you from the former owner of this restaurant.
He apologizes, he sent me because he has sore legs.
I have sore legs too.
What's written? I can't read.
Pass me the towel.
He hasn't a damned thing to do!
And these whores hanging around here!
Shit!
A curious correspondence started, and Pascal hadn't a clue.
I replied to each of his letters to the cook.
You should reduce heat so that the fish will not boil.
When the fish is cooled, top it with a cranberry sauce.
With a cranberry sauce, that's a good idea.
Obviously, the sauce must be lightly sugared.
This is the marriage of salt with sugar.
Thank you.
- No, no.
- Take it.
- Go on keeping them for me.
- Goodbye.
Thank you.
Dear Mr. cook,
I really respect your opinion.
I love you.
Can't you eat anything yet.
Let's go home?
Home.
I'll run a bath for you.
I love you.
Pascal.
Kill me.
Then, you'll kill yourself.
This will be so beautiful.
The masterpiece in a bed.
I am happy, I'm expecting a child from my French lover.
I would like to shout it to the world, but I keep quiet.
It's a boy.
I called him Anton.
One day I'll tell him.
Only to him, it will remain our secret.
How strange,
I don't know why, whenever I think of my mother, she appears to me as a bird lying in the snow.
How strange.
To pull the trigger seemed too simple to him.
Zigmund had seen Hamlet in the theater.
To pour mercury into the ear of the old French cook, seemed to him a good idea.
One cannot get mercury.
Never mind my dear!
You got a good idea to break thermometers.
Ah, my little girl!
- But you know that it is a poison?
- Yes, be careful!
He asked Cecilia to get mercury she had never understood why.
Oh, but how sad you are, look at that.
How sad you are.
You need a little of water.
A little of water for me, a little of water for you.
You shouldn't be sad, because there is sun.
And maybe the Princess will come.
The Princess, yes.
Look at that!
I'm not happy, you must grow, turn red.
Look at your big sisters.
Go ripe, do you know why?
Don't be afraid, I won't eat you.
Because you are velvety like the skin of a princess.
A princess velouté, here.
That's what I have found, a princess velouté.
He beat me to it!
And now...
Pascal used to say,
"take care of your appetite, as of your loves."
She is perhaps Hitler's best-known victim.
Her book has sold more than 25 million copies...
...and has been translated into at least 55 languages.
She's become a symbol of 10 million souls murdered by the Nazis...
...Jews and non-Jews...
...and, in particular, the one and a half million innocent children.
She was just 15 when she died.
A miserable and lonely death in a concentration camp in Germany.
Yet she is remembered for her faith in humanity.
This is the story of the life and legacy of Anne Frank.
In Amsterdam, some of the remnants of a once-thriving Jewish community.
Every person in this congregation, like Jews throughout Europe...
...has a story of their own...
...of persecution, murder, fear or betrayal.
The rabbi spent the first
2 years of his life in hiding...
...sheltered by a Christian family.
But one girl reaches beyond all those memories.
Hers is not just a Holocaust story, for the voice of Anne Frank...
...stands as a warning to those who discriminate on the basis...
...of color, culture or creed.
Her message is as fresh today as it was 50 years ago.
The notorious Nazi propaganda film...
...The Eternal Jew.
Distorted images portraying an Aryan nightmare...
...of the Jewish threat to European civilization.
And this, the family Frank:
Prosperous, cultivated, sophisticated...
...and integrated.
In fact, they were a German family.
German to the core.
The antithesis of ghetto Jews.
Anne's father, Otto, was an officer in the German army...
...in the first World War.
The family had lived in and around
Frankfurt for generations.
But Otto had traveled the world, even working in Macy's store in New York...
...where a college friend,
Nathan Straus, was the owner's son.
In 1925, the 36-year-old Otto married Edith Hollander...
...a 25-year-old Jewish girl from Aachen, Germany...
...near the Dutch border.
They honeymooned in Italy.
Their first daughter, Margot, followed 9 months later...
...and their second, Annelies, better known as Anne, in June 1929.
It was a good life in Frankfurt in those early years.
One could almost forget the long shadow of National Socialism.
But beneath the idyllic surface...
...far removed from the children's world, turmoil.
DANGER JEWS
Their landlord turned out to be a Nazi party member.
And in March 1931, they moved.
The bank owned by the family also had serious problems...
...resulting in its complete collapse in 1933...
...caused by Otto's brother being the victim of a fraud...
...and the effects of the Depression, particularly acute in Germany.
And, of course, the threat of the gathering storm.
On the streets...
...at the rallies...
ONE RACE ONE NATION
...and finally in January 1933...
...the ballot box.
ONE LEADER
For it is often forgotten that Hitler gained power in a democratic election.
For the Franks, the German dream was over.
Some of the family had moved to Switzerland.
Otto chose to try his luck in Holland...
...where he had prior business connections.
In autumn 1933, the family settled here in Merwedeplein...
...a modern housing development in South Amsterdam.
They established a settled and full existence amongst German refugees...
...and Dutch neighbors.
We moved into the same neighborhood as the Frank family.
Many other refugees moved there.
And so there was a little bit of a German-Jewish enclave...
...by no means a ghetto, but just a little enclave.
Quite often parents would speak
German in the street...
...which annoyed us children terribly, of course.
Hanneli Goslar
My father was a deputy minister in the interior.
And he was the chief of the press in Germany.
He had really a very high position.
And he immediately fled...
...when the whole government stepped down.
And, okay, we went to England before...
...but he didn't find a job where he didn't have to work Shabbat.
And so we stopped here in Merwedeplein.
Life for Jewish refugees...
...as I experienced it as a young child, in a way had its charms.
What I particularly enjoyed was that we adapted faster than our parents.
Our parents had to turn to us and ask us...
...what's done in this country.
And I found this tremendously democratizing.
I really enjoyed that part very much.
The Franks formed an active social life amongst the other refugee families.
For visitors, Anne's behavior made the Sunday gatherings...
...something of an ordeal.
She was just what you could call naughty.
She had to sit on a table where everything was very beautiful...
...in a beautiful dress and have her chocolate not spoil it.
Isa Baschwitz
She just didn't want to.
She got up and she made fuss, and she...
...drew attention.
And then she grew angry.
And that angriness...
...that was the problem between the parents.
Mother Frank said, "You sit down. "
And Father Frank said:
"Leave the child alone.
She's so small and she's so little. "
So she was allowed to do the things she wanted.
And that happened every time.
Every time that girl was naughty...
...was impertinent, later on, really impertinent.
I remember very strongly that Mr. Frank...
...was seen as an ideal daddy, that he was the daddy...
...because he was so much involved in his girls' education.
He fixed his wife breakfast on Sunday morning and brought it to her bedside...
...which was unheard of in our circles.
So that news made the round:
"Mr. Frank does this for his wife!
How great. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
We left Germany in 1933...
...because I didn't want to educate my children with blinkers.
They were not allowed to see
Christian friends anymore.
In Holland, it was different.
Upon her arrival in Amsterdam...
...the 4-year-old Anne was sent to the Montessori school...
...where Lies Goslar became her best friend.
Years later, in her diary,
Anne wrote this of Lies:
"Hanneli Goslar, or Lies, as she's called at school, is a bit strange.
She's usually shy...
...outspoken at home but reserved around other people.
She blabs whatever you tell her to her mother.
But she says what she thinks.
And lately, I've come to appreciate her a great deal. "
Anne and Lies' friendship had begun on their very first day at school.
Exactly in opposite of the door...
...I saw the back of Anne, and she was ringing these little bells.
And she turned around, and she saw me,
I saw her, and hop...
...we run each into the arms of another.
I think my mother went away.
I didn't look at her anymore.
And this was the first day.
Since then we were together really till the end.
Of the two sisters, I was really more impressed with Margot than with Anne...
...for rather obvious reasons.
Margot was a year and a half older than I am, so she was a model.
She was ladylike.
She was always composed.
She always did her homework.
She was just the ideal young lady.
I was a tomboy, so I always thought it would be great to be like Margot.
Anne was very lively, and I didn't need any model for that.
I was lively myself.
Besides, she was younger. You never model yourself after a younger child.
So I know her-
All the time.
I could do that just as well.
I will start with the sentence my mother said always.
My mother said, "God knows everything.
Anne knows everything better. "
This describes Anne, you understand?
I don't know in English...
She knew everything better.
Anne was- In America you say "spicy. "
A spicy girl.
She always was friendly with the boys.
The boys liked her.
The girls liked her. She also always was in the center of the thing.
Then she had something I never saw, not before and not afterwards.
She could take out the socket out of the shoulder...
...and she would sit, and everybody looked.
And then she made out, and knock, knock, knock.
You have to be very careful. You can end up with an orthopedic doctor.
She liked it, and everybody was looking at her. And then she was happy.
When he came to Holland, Otto Frank set up the Opekta Company...
...a Dutch subsidiary of a German concern, selling pectin...
...a substance used in making jam.
The progressive Otto had a film produced to promote the product.
In the early days, he had four key colleagues, all non-Jews.
One of those employees was an Austrian who'd grown up in Holland.
Miep Gies.
It was a very fine place to work...
...because we understand all the people in the office.
We were very close, was friendly together.
He was always our boss...
...but also our father.
We can go to Mr. Frank with all our troubles and sorrow.
The office boy and general helper from 1933 until 1939...
...was Henk van Beersekamp.
Mrs. Frank was different from Otto Frank.
Otto Frank was a familiar, friendly man...
...who treated me as an equal...
...and with kindness.
Mrs. Frank was a bit...
...well, maybe she had been accustomed...
...to better things in life in Germany.
I don't know.
Margot was a bit subdued...
...but Anne was a dear.
I had lots of fun with her...
...because we would make funny faces...
...which she found amusing.
I remember one time I did this:
And she always split her sides with laughter.
And when I did that, her tongue...
...would move to and fro.
But it was fun.
She was a great girl.
Dutch Nazis putting on a show in Amsterdam in 1938.
Though Hitler had infiltrated the police, the civil service...
...even the prime minister...
...in the years before the war, Holland...
...was generally good to its Jewish refugees from Germany.
Despite these scenes of Fascist collaborators...
...the Dutch and German Jews believed that they would be safe in Holland...
...far from the Führer in their former homeland.
Few, very few, tried to leave for safer shores.
And Otto and his family were not amongst them.
Sometimes I said to Mr. Frank:
"You must go out of the Netherlands.
It will be danger for you. "
Miep Gies
"No," said he.
"In the first World War, the German came not here in the Netherlands.
So they come the second time, also not. "
And I said to him,
"You must go to America. "
"No, I stay here because I love the Netherlands. "
The faith of Otto Frank and thousands like him...
...was catastrophically misplaced.
By May 1940, Hitler had conquered almost all of Europe.
Austria, Poland, Norway, Denmark...
...Yugoslavia, Greece,
Romania, Bulgaria...
...and most of France had fallen to
Germany's air force and storm troops.
Europe's low countries remained as a tantalizing morsel...
...to be swallowed whole.
Then by the 14th of May, 1940, it was all over.
Five days after the Germans had finally...
...smashed through Holland's borders, the Dutch capitulated.
In Amsterdam, Hitler's victory was greeted with black humor.
My father made himself look like Hitler.
It was wonderful how he did it.
Here was the hair and the black mustache.
The Franks lived next door, and he would ring at the door and come in.
I remember them all, you know, the first moment.
They were very frightened what happened.
If you could think Hitler didn't come to their house.
But it was very funny how everybody was frightened at the moment...
...till they...
...till they saw who it was and what happened.
What happened to your father?
He died in Bergen-Belsen.
The German vice tightened gradually.
First they conducted a hearts-and-minds campaign to win over the Dutch...
...their Aryan brothers.
THANK ADOLF HITLER
JEWISH QUARTER
For the Jews, it was another story...
...as their freedom was gradually restricted...
...by a never-ending series of anti-Jewish decrees...
...already familiar in Germany and other conquered territories.
JEWS PROHIBlTED
By 1942...
...no area of Jewish life was excluded from German control.
Jews Prohibited
By Law
Everything that was fun in life was forbidden.
We were not allowed to go anymore to a park or to a swimming pool.
We were not allowed to go to shops.
Only to Jewish shops and only between 3 and 5.
8:00 in the evening you had to be at home.
You had to wear the star.
You had to have something with you that would look if you are Jewish or not...
...even if you had the star.
Then things were-
You were frightened.
You just wouldn't go out.
To school and home, and that's it, yes.
How one of the friends of Anne said:
"Everything I did, I was afraid it is forbidden. "
Well, the effect of these restrictions...
...was, I think, mainly...
...because it came inch by inch, very slowly.
"If that's all, we can bear it. "
We always had a stiff upper lip, and we tried to make the best of it.
If you can't go to public school anymore...
...there are good Jewish teachers.
If you can't go to concerts, which was important in my family...
...there are fine Jewish musicians, so we make music at home.
So we always tried to put the best spin...
...on whatever happened.
And that way, I think, we tried to ward off...
...thinking about how we were being more restricted...
...and what was going to be sure to come afterwards.
Otto Frank, always the perfect father...
...rented movies to show the girls on the living room wall.
Rin Tin Tin was a particular favorite with Anne.
She and her friend Jacqueline van
Maarsen created a cinema of their own.
Together we made little cards to get in.
Of course, everybody could come in, but we wanted to make it look real...
...by making these little tickets.
"Jacqueline van Maarsen...
...is invited on Sunday, the 1st of March...
...with Anne Frank, Merwedeplein 37...
...for...
...a movie.
Without this card, no entrance.
Please inform in time. Row 2.
Seat 2."
THE LIGHTHOUSE BY THE SEA
WITH RIN TIN TIN
This film supplied the entertainment for Anne and her friends...
...when they celebrated her 13th birthday...
...her last in freedom.
Her prized gift that 13th birthday...
...on Friday, the 12th of June, 1942...
...was her diary...
...a present she had bought with her father a few days before.
From the beginning, Anne addressed her diary as a special friend...
...with whom she would conduct a secret correspondence.
Her first entry was this:
"I hope I will be able to confide everything to you...
...as I have never been able to confide in anyone.
And I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. "
Her early diary jottings were typical of a 13-year-old:
Gossip about school friends, jokes...
...and a record of her unextraordinary daily life...
...together with photos and other scraps.
In the years that followed, she also shared her most intimate secrets...
...including her increasing interest in the development of her body and in sex.
What interested Anne very much was sexual behavior...
...and she wanted to know what it was all about.
Jacqueline "Jopie" van Maarsen
And she asked her father about it.
I knew much more than she did...
...because I had my sister, who told me everything.
So I thought, "Well, I'm not going to enlighten you altogether.
You just ask your father. "
At the time, Anne's body was not changing yet.
And I think that she was curious...
...because she had some little...
She used a bra from Margot with cotton wool in it...
...to show a bit of breast.
And I did not need that kind of thing...
...and she was interested to see exactly...
While Anne was innocently absorbed with her developing body...
...Otto Frank was mindful that if the Nazi measures against Jews...
...continued to their inevitable conclusion...
...he and his family would need to take precautions to protect themselves.
For a year, he had been secretly preparing a hiding place for them all...
...together with his German business associate Hermann van Pels...
...van Pels' wife, Auguste, and son, Peter.
It was to be in several rooms behind the company offices on Prinsengracht...
...in central Amsterdam.
Laboriously, and unknown to all but the innermost circle...
...Otto accumulated furniture, cooking implements...
...bedding and clothes.
At the Frank home, two and a half miles away in Merwedeplein...
...Sunday, the 5th of July, 1942, was the day that everyone had dreaded...
...had hoped against hope would never come.
That Sunday, the Germans delivered...
...this innocuous document by registered mail...
...to several thousand Jews, the majority of them of German extraction...
...aged between 15 and 40.
They were to report within 9 days to be transported to a labor camp...
...in Germany.
Margot Frank was one of them...
...throwing her family, like so many, into crisis.
The agonies at that moment were when you had some youngsters saying:
"Labor won't floor me. I'm strong.
I can do whatever's asked of me.
I'm going and that's it. "
And the parents would say, "No, stay.
It's going to be the end of your life. "
So you saw the family in tension.
Then you had other families where a youngster would say:
"I don't want to go. I'm scared. What will happen?" The parents would say:
"You must go. Remember, grandmother lives with us and the baby.
If you don't go, we'll be punished. "
And you saw the families really...
...torn asunder by these events.
And that was terrible.
Nine years after fleeing Germany, the Franks were on the run again.
By 7:30 on Monday, the 6th of July, 1942...
...the whole family had disappeared...
...leaving behind an elaborate false trail...
...indicating they had fled to Switzerland.
We came here...
...and the kitchen was not...
The kitchen was just left like it was...
...with everything dirty in the sink.
I went into her room, and I saw her bed not made.
And the shoes that she loved, she'd just received them for the summer...
...were near the bed.
I came here, you see.
I went up, and I am ringing and ringing and ringing...
...and nobody opens.
And at the end somebody opened.
It was a tenant. Mr. Goudschmidt.
He had the room at the roof in the Frank apartment.
He looked at me as if he'd never seen me before.
And I didn't know what happened.
He said, "What do you want?"
"I come to play as usual. " And he said:
"Yes, but don't you know? The Frank family left for Switzerland. "
Miep Gies had been given the responsibility of getting Margot...
...who was now in flight from the Germans, to the hiding place.
I took Margot by bicycle.
Monday morning, very raining.
And that was good for us because the German...
...came not on street.
And I came with her to the Prinsengracht 263...
...go up with her.
She was very...
-Upset?
-Yes. She was very upset.
I saw it.
And when I was standing with her in front of the hiding place...
...I was afraid that she would...
...fall down.
And what could I do with her?
I opened the door and put her in.
Despite Otto's carefully laid plans...
...on their first day there, the family was surrounded by chaos.
When I come there, it was terrible.
Nothing was okay.
And Mrs. Frank and Margot were sitting down on the bed.
They could not do anything.
There was...
They couldn't accept this situation.
But Anne and Mr. Frank were busy, very busy.
I ask Mrs. Frank,
"Can I do something for you?"
"No," said Mrs. Frank.
"For today, I have all the things. "
And then I went down.
But the next day, when I came, all was okay.
-So Anne and Mr. Frank-?
-Were busy the whole day.
Was this typical of the family?
Yes. That was typical for the family.
Now the family was dependent on Otto Frank's four employees...
...who had volunteered to help them survive.
Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler supplied Anne and Margot...
...with school books and other reading matter...
...at the same time, ensuring the Opekta
Company continued to function...
...even producing record profits that could be used to keep everyone alive.
Miep Gies and her assistant, the 23-year-old typist, Bep Voskuijl...
...had the dangerous task of supplying the residents of the annex with food...
...purchased on the black market or with forged or stolen ration books.
In one of her first diary entries in hiding...
...Anne described her new home to her imaginary friend:
"Thursday, July 9, 1942.
Dear Kitty:
Our secret annex is at the back of the building.
There's just one small step in front of the door, and then you're inside.
Straight ahead of you is a steep flight of stairs.
To the left is a narrow hallway opening onto a room...
...that serves as the Frank family's living room and bedroom.
Next door is a smaller room:
The bedroom and study of the two young ladies of the family.
To the right of the stairs is a windowless washroom with a sink.
The door in the corner leads to the toilet...
...and another one to Margot's and my room.
If you go up the stairs and open the door at the top...
...you're surprised to see such a light and spacious room...
...in an old canal house like this.
It contains a stove and a sink.
This will be the kitchen and bedroom for Mr. and Mrs. van Pels...
...as well as the general living room, dining room and study for us all.
A tiny side room is to be
Peter van Pels' bedroom.
Then just as in the front part of the building...
...there's an attic and a loft. "
As they settled into their confinement, the chimes of the Westerkerk clock...
...seemed to act as a constant reminder of the world they had left behind them.
Before long, the entrance to the hiding place was disguised...
...as a bookcase.
But in every respect, what lay behind those innocuous files...
...was untypical of the shelter provided to other Jews.
It was relatively spacious, within a city.
There were people outside dedicated to helping and protecting them.
Most families were torn apart...
...but here, all four of the Franks could stay together.
A week later, they were joined by their friends the van Pelses.
Miep Gies visited each day.
When I came here from this door...
...in the middle was standing the table with the chairs.
All the people, seven people...
...were standing in the line here.
Did not say any word.
Did not say any word...
...but waited for me to begin.
It was always an awful moment for me...
...because I felt the dependence...
...from these people of us, the helpers.
Except Anne. Anne was in the front.
She asked, "Hello, Miep, what is the news?"
In those early months,
Anne was desperately lonely...
...and always hoping for news of her friends.
She even invented a correspondence with one of them.
"September 25, 1942.
Dear Jacqueline:
I'm writing this letter in order to bid you goodbye.
I can't write to everyone, and that's why I'm just writing to you.
I'd be grateful if you'd be really nice...
...and keep up a secret correspondence with me.
All inquiries to Mrs. Gies.
I hope we'll meet again soon...
...but it probably won't be before the end of the war.
Well, then, Jackie,
I hope things go well with you...
...and that I hear from you soon.
Your best friend, Anne.
P. S.:
I hope that we'll always stay best friends until we meet again.
Bye. "
I think that she wrote it immediately...
...after she went into hiding.
And afterwards, at that moment in September, she wrote it down.
She invented in that my answer to her.
And then she wrote a second letter...
...in answer to this invented letter.
And she must have been very lonely that she invented these letters.
Anne also wrote a long fantasy in which she imagined living with her cousin...
...in the safety of Switzerland.
When I think that when Anne wrote about Switzerland and about me...
Bernd Elias
...it must have been a painful thought to her...
...to realize that she was like a bird in a cage...
...and we, over here in Switzerland...
...were free to do anything we wanted to do.
And all her dreams...
...were caged in.
And we, the boys, her cousins...
...could fulfill everything she was dreaming of.
It must have been a very, very hard thing for her.
In the diary, she even designs a skating dress...
-... so she can be your skating partner.
-Yes.
Yes, when I saw that the first time...
...it really overwhelmed me.
It made me cry, to be very honest.
Especially then that I knew she was not alive anymore when I saw it.
I would have loved to go skating with her.
Anne also addressed her diary entries to a circle of imaginary friends...
...all characters from a well-known series of books for adolescent girls.
Eventually, she settled on one friend, Kitty...
...as her diary correspondent.
Anne was always a very curious child.
When I was upstairs and went away...
...she'd always wait till the last to speak with me.
And then she had me.
And she asked everything what happened outside.
And I told her the truth.
The terrible truth.
"November 19, 1942.
Dearest Kitty:
Countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a dreadful fate.
Night after night, green and gray military vehicles...
...cruise the streets.
In the evenings, when it's dark...
...I often see long lines of good, innocent people...
...accompanied by crying children, walking on and on.
No one is spared.
The sick, the elderly, children...
...babies and pregnant women all are marched to their death.
I get frightened when I think of close friends who are now at the mercy...
...of the cruelest monsters to stalk the earth.
And all because they're Jews. "
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Margot's classmate
At the beginning of the class of '41, we had about 50 children.
The deportations began in July '42.
And then from 50 children...
...all the time, children disappeared.
When you came in your class, you said:
"That child's missing and that one and that one. "
You did hope they were ill.
But you knew that they were round up...
...or maybe they were hidden.
At the end of the school year...
...in April '43...
...there were three children left...
...two boys and I.
And we did our final examination...
...together.
The second part of the final examination, I was alone.
It was very sad.
Very difficult.
From 50 children, one remained at the end of the year?
While the roundups of their friends continued outside...
...in their hiding place,
Anne and the others...
...tried to establish a kind of normality.
"Dear Kitty:
Up to now, our bedroom with its blank walls was very bare.
Thanks to Father, who brought my entire...
...post card and movie star collection here beforehand...
...and to a brush and a pot of glue...
...I was able to plaster the walls with pictures. "
We were both collecting pictures...
...from the children of the queen.
Here you see Elizabeth, today Queen Elizabeth...
...and her sister Margaret.
And I also was collecting, and we would change together.
We had from Belgium...
From all the queens in the world, we would change pictures.
I liked it very much. Anne was also collecting from film stars.
This I wasn't interested in at all.
I only remember she had
Deanna Durbin. This one.
This is the only one I remember from then. I never saw a film.
I don't remember if Anne saw films.
We went to see Shirley Temple films.
And here in Amsterdam, we had a cinema, Cineac.
There you could see one hour a little film and news.
And then it started.
Over there, we would go very often.
Four months after going into hiding, an 8th person joined the annex...
...a 54-year-old German dentist,
Fritz Pfeffer.
Margot slept on a folding bed with her parents.
And Anne had to share her room with the newcomer.
Look, Mr. Pfeffer was my dentist.
And Mr. Pfeffer asked me always:
"Miep, do you have a place for me?"
Then I went next day...
...in the hiding place and tell it to Mr. Frank and the other peoples.
They listened to me.
Next day, Mr. Frank said:
"Miep, where seven people can eat...
...can eight also eat. "
Pfeffer moved into Anne's bedroom...
...complete with his drill and dental implements.
While no one would now lack treatment of their cavities...
...relations between the 54-year-old disciplinarian...
...and the free spirit in her early teens...
...were inevitably stormy.
On this corner...
...it was the desk...
...for Anne...
...and Pfeffer.
There this...
This gave sometimes troubles with Anne.
Anne was standing on her rights.
From so till so is her time.
But I believe Mr. Pfeffer...
...did not see the importance of a diary...
...for a little child.
"Him and his lies.
I'll smack his ugly mug so hard, he'll go bouncing off the wall.
Anyone who is so petty and pedantic at the age of 54 was born that way...
...and is never going to change. "
What Anne never knew was that Fritz Pfeffer had a son...
...whom he had raised as a single parent in Germany...
...until sending him to England after Kristallnacht in 1938.
A few weeks later, Pfeffer himself fled to Amsterdam...
...with his fiancee, Charlotte.
But his 11-year-old son never saw his father again.
Peter Pepper
Fritz Pfeffer's son
We're talking about a girl under very difficult circumstances...
...who first of all decided that my father was not a nice man.
Therefore, she called him Dr. Dussel, which in English is "idiot. "
As far as my point of view...
...retrospectively to the age of 11 and below...
...there's a very large inaccuracy.
First of all, my father, although being a very strict man...
...was a very kind man.
What other people don't recognize...
...is his love of life, his love of freedom.
My father was a sportsman.
He loved to row.
He loved to ride horses.
He liked to climb mountains.
So if you take a man who's always been active all his life...
...and then in flight he ends up here...
...it's like caging a bird.
Weekly, Mrs. Miep Gies would bring a package containing letters...
...and other personal messages from Charlotte Karletta.
And weekly, she would take a letter from him to her.
What do you feel now about what that may have meant for your father?
What it meant for my father...
...is that it is a thin lifeline.
A thin lifeline that was the only hope of expression...
...and relationship.
Because with Charlotte's letters to him...
...expressing her love, her feelings...
...her news, whatever it was in those letters...
...is the only thing where my father would have...
...the semblance of mental health.
Because you're a prisoner of your own mind.
For the first time, Fritz Pfeffer's son meets his father's protector.
Mr. Pfeffer.
How do you do?
Fine.
I was a very good friend of your father.
Do you understand German?
I came into contact with him every day.
He was my dentist, exceptionally good.
He asked me if I could help him...
...find a place, and so I helped him.
Unbelievable.
Nice to meet you.
He was a lovely, lovely man.
Do you speak English?
Very bad.
Shall we try German?
Yes, if that's okay, it would be better.
What would you like to know?
I just want to say...
...two words.
Many thanks.
Two months after this meeting,
Peter Pepper died of cancer.
If Anne reserved her special venom for Fritz Pfeffer...
...with the claustrophobia of the months in hiding that turned into years...
...all the adults at one time or another were subjected to the fury of her pen.
"September 27, 1942.
Some people, like the van Pelses, take delight not only...
...in raising their own children...
...but in helping others raise theirs.
Margot doesn't need it since she is naturally good...
...kind and clever, perfection itself.
But I seem to have enough mischief for the two of us.
More than once, the air's been filled with the van Pels' admonitions...
...and my saucy replies.
They tell me I should talk less, mind my own business and be more modest.
But I seem doomed to failure. "
Otto, the ever-indulgent father, was frequently called in...
...to act as a peacemaker between Anne and the others.
Her adoration of him was matched only by her increasing problems...
...with her mother.
"I cling to Father because my contempt of Mother is growing daily.
And it is only through him that I'm able to retain...
...the last ounce of family feeling I have left.
I don't know how I should act.
I can't very well confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm...
...and her hard-heartedness.
Yet I can't continue to take the blame for everything.
I'm the opposite of Mother, so of course we clash.
She's not a mother to me.
I have to mother myself.
I'm charting my own course and will see where it leads me. "
Mrs. Frank was the most depressed of all the people.
Sometimes when I go out of the hiding place...
...the staircase downstairs...
...she went with me till the door.
I did not understand that.
What did she want of me?
And once again, I go with her in her sleeping room...
...and she closed the door, and then she said to me:
"Miep...
...I am so afraid. "
She told me all her troubles.
But what could I do?
I didn't say anything...
...because I was in the same position as she.
While Anne and her mother feuded...
...in the second year, she developed a strong passion for Peter van Pels...
...the 17-year-old boy with whom she shared her caged existence.
They spent hours together in the loft chatting...
...or simply staring out the window at the chestnut tree.
"Sunday, March 19, 1944.
I have the feeling that Peter and I share a secret.
When he looks at me with those eyes, with that smile and with that wink...
...it's as if a light goes on inside me.
I hope things stay like this...
...and we'll have many, many more happy hours together.
Your grateful and happy Anne. "
Peter van Pels was a blue-eyed boy...
...with very little intellectual capacity.
I didn't know him nearly as well as I knew Anne.
But he once came to our house when we were reading the classics...
...and he was so singularly bewildered by it...
...that I remember thinking:
"My goodness, he doesn't know a thing!"
The relationship with Peter waxed and then waned.
They cuddled and kissed, but as she noted in her diary...
...Anne gradually became dissatisfied...
...with his inability to express his feelings.
The pressures of confinement created and then crushed...
...their adolescent love affair.
In the secret annex, the claustrophobia was stifling.
The radio, broadcasting from England...
...was an essential lifeline to news from the outside world.
Every Allied victory brought hope, every defeat, gloom.
Arguments over food blew up into major rows.
And then always the ever-present threat of discovery.
The windows had to be covered by blinds, even in the heat of summer.
The toilet could only be used outside office hours.
No one could walk in shoes on the lower floor...
...for fear that the workers in the warehouse below would hear.
And always the question,
"Would they be betrayed...
...or would they betray themselves by some inadvertent error?"
To add to everyone's fears...
...the warehouse and offices under their hiding place were burgled a few times.
My father had the maintenance of the building, the daily maintenance.
Hans Wijnberg
Later I recognized that he must have been the carpenter...
...that's repairing the door...
...which is opened by the burglary in the book, in Anne Frank's diary.
I think there were two burglaries, weren't there?
Yeah. The other one was me.
What were you after?
I think it's a mixture of adventure and spices.
We found some spices.
But we had to move out...
...because we recognized people living in the house...
...because they made a mistake upstairs.
That's what I later realized.
I didn't know it was the Frank family.
We did not know.
We were not supposed to know who was living in a house...
...because of what I explained earlier.
You didn't speak about people living somewhere.
So we heard them flushing the toilet...
...so we moved out because that was a sign people were upstairs.
And well, we were not there with an agreement of anybody.
"Wednesday, March 29, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
Mr. Bolkestein, the cabinet minister...
...speaking on the Dutch broadcast from London...
...said that after the war, a collection would be made of diaries and letters...
...dealing with the war.
Of course, everyone pounced on my diary.
Imagine how interesting it would be if I published a novel...
...about the secret annex.
The title alone would make people think it was a detective story.
Seriously though,
10 years after the war...
...people would find it very amusing to read how we lived...
...what we ate and what we talked about as Jews in hiding. "
For 6 weeks, Anne thought constantly about the message from London.
Then she made up her mind.
She had wanted to be a journalist, a famous writer, to travel the world...
...see Paris and Hollywood.
This was her opportunity.
Starting in the middle of May 1944...
...she began to furiously rewrite her whole diary from the first entry...
...with a view to future publication...
...at the same time as keeping up her regular diary entries.
"Tuesday, June 6, 1944.
Dearest Kitty:
'This is D-day, ' the BBC announced at 12.
'This is the day.
The invasion has begun. '
A huge commotion in the annex.
Is this really the beginning of the long-awaited liberation?
The liberation we've all talked so much about...
...which still seems too good, too much of a fairy tale ever to come true?
Will this year, 1944, bring us victory?
We don't know yet.
But where there's hope, there's life.
It fills us with fresh courage and makes us strong again.
The best part of the invasion...
...is that I have the feeling that friends are on the way.
Those terrible Germans have oppressed and threatened us for so long...
...that the thought of friends and salvation...
...means everything to us.
Maybe, Margot says...
...I can even go back to school...
...in October or September. "
With the Allies advancing, the spirits in the annex soared.
Otto Frank kept a map...
...tracking every advance of the British and American troops.
But the odds were stacked against those in the hiding place.
Of the 25,000 Jews who hid from the Nazis in Holland during WWII...
...some 8 to 9 thousand were discovered by the Germans...
...or betrayed by their Dutch hosts.
Many of the Franks' neighbors, some of whom were known Nazi sympathizers...
...knew there was something going on in the back house...
...at 263 Prinsengracht.
Anyone could've called the authorities to collect the reward...
...for betraying Jews in hiding.
Anne herself chronicled many acts of carelessness...
...that could've led to the suspicion that could easily lead on to betrayal.
It has never been proved how they were betrayed...
...but on a sunny summer morning in 1944...
...two years after they first stepped behind their secret door...
...their world collapsed.
It was the 4th of August...
You know, it was always my task to go first...
...up in the hiding place.
Also this day.
I go up, took my shopping list...
...talked with the people...
...and came down.
After an hour, I was working in the office.
Bep in front of me,
Koophuis on this side.
The door...
...goes open, but I did not look.
And it was quiet.
In a moment, I look up...
...and there was a man standing before me with a gun to me...
...and said:
"Quiet. No words. "
Was there ever a plan...
...for this sort of situation?
No. No.
We were so...
...sure that it never would happen.
The authorities were alerted by an anonymous phone call...
...that there were Jews hiding in the Opekta offices.
Four Dutch policemen from the German security service...
...led by an Austrian officer, went straight to the secret bookcase.
I could hear the voice of the Nazi.
And I heard this man...
...speak with a...
...with a Vienna accent.
And if you know, I'm born in Vienna.
I know that accent.
I stand up and say to him...
...in a nearly friendly mien:
"You are a Vienna.
I'm a Vienna too. "
And this one sentence...
...was perhaps too much for this man.
He was standing there...
...looked at me.
And when he come to him-
He come to me...
...so near to me that I feel his...
...his adem.
His breath, I feel his breath.
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself...
...helping Jewish baggage?
You deserve to receive...
...the worst punishment.
And you know what that is. "
I did not say any word.
I was...
He was going in my office from the one wall to the other...
...as a wild...
...animal.
Animal.
After a while, he stood still...
...looked me a little friendlier.
"Out of personal sympathy, you may stay...
...but woe betide you if you flee.
Then we'll take your husband. "
When the Germans captured
Jews in hiding...
...they looted everything of value.
Officially, this was meant to finance the transportation of the Jews...
...to the Polish death camps.
But corruption was rife...
...and Jewish valuables often lined the pockets of Nazi policemen.
Needing a container for his loot...
...the Austrian arresting officer, SS
Oberscharführer Karl Silberbauer...
...emptied the contents of Otto
Frank's briefcase onto the floor.
And thus, he left behind
Anne's diary.
After the Franks and the other peoples were away...
...I come here in...
...and found...
...the diary scattered on the floor.
Ellie and me, Bep and me.
Bep and me, we saw this.
"That is the diary of Anne!"
"Please take! Take it!"
We took all the things...
...but I was afraid...
...that I had not all the paper of the diary. I knew that.
But I was so in hurry...
...because I was afraid that this Austrian man came again.
-That the officer-
-That the officer...
Because he say,
"I come back. "
Within two weeks of Miep Gies saving Anne's diary...
...the Dutch firm of A-Puls stripped the hiding place of its possessions...
...to be sent to Germany to aid bombed-out German civilians.
Silberbauer and his assistants had taken the eight Jewish prisoners...
...to Gestapo headquarters, housed here in a former school in Amsterdam.
Of the helpers, Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler were also arrested.
Though not the two women,
Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl.
Kleiman and Kugler were then sent here...
...to Amersfoort labor camp in Holland...
...shown in this film during a Dutch Red Cross inspection.
Kleiman was released in September due to bad health...
...and Kugler managed to escape in 1945...
...when the train in which he...
...was being transported to Germany was bombed by American planes.
The day after the arrest of the Franks, the van Pelses and Pfeffer...
...Miep tried one last desperate effort to help them.
I go to the Gestapo.
And when you dare go in...
...you did not know if you come out.
I found this Austrian man...
...and he said, "Yes, come. "
I went to him.
But when I came there, his office was full of young people.
Secretaries and all the peoples.
But he was sitting in the corner.
And when I came in, I could not-
I think...
..."I cannot speak with this man what I want. "
So I go to the corner to him...
...over his desk, and I did so:
"Understand me," I said to him.
"Please come back tomorrow.
I can't do anything more for you today. "
And then I went away.
Next morning, I go to him.
He was standing in the door...
...waiting for me.
"I am sorry," he said to me.
"I can't do anything for you...
...because I am not high enough.
You understand me?"
And I said to him,
"I don't believe you. "
"Go to my boss. "
And I go upstairs.
I knocked on the door.
Nobody said anything.
Then I opened the door, and what did I see?
A large table...
...sitting high German people.
Their caps on the table, and in the middle...
...the radio, listening to England.
That was very, very-
Was not allowed for the German people.
And it was very dangerous for me...
...because I saw what they did.
And I said, "Who is he, the boss?"
One man came to me, pushed me out of the door.
"You are a swine. "
And then I went down.
And this Vienna man was standing in the door.
I said, "What did I say to you?"
And then I went down...
...and I feel...
...the curtain of this play was fallen for me.
Afterfour days in the cellars of the Gestapo building...
...the prisoners were taken to the Amsterdam railway depot.
They were loaded under guard onto an ordinary passenger train.
Janny Brilleslijper, a member of the Dutch Resistance...
...was amongst the prisoners.
What I saw was a family.
There were a number of people...
...a very worried father and a nervous mother...
...and two children...
...wearing sports clothes, I believe.
Of course, it is more than fifty years ago.
They had sports clothes on...
...and backpacks with them...
...and the four of them...
...stayed together constantly.
They spoke very softly to one another...
...and there were other people there.
It was a beautiful day...
...the sun shone to greet you...
...the houses of the city were bathed in gold...
...and those people all had a sort of...
...silent melancholy about them.
Nobody said anything.
I cannot say that the people were afraid.
We went to meet the unknown.
We didn't know what was waiting for us.
This was the first destination for the Franks and the other prisoners.
Westerbork Transit Camp in northern Holland.
This film was made by the commandant...
...to show his superiors in Berlin how successful he was...
...in keeping his prisoners occupied...
...before sending them on to less benign places in Poland or Germany.
104,000 people were processed through here...
...between 1942 and 1945...
...more than 75% of the Jews in Holland...
...before the outbreak of war.
Proudly, and without irony, the commandant showed...
...the humiliation of his prisoners...
...who were largely ignorant of the fate that awaited them.
Of the 60,000 or so who were sent to Auschwitz from here...
...only 673 were ever to return.
And of the 34,313 transported to Sobibor death camp...
...just 19 came back.
In the meantime, Westerbork offered ball games and calisthenics.
The Jews were encouraged to entertain themselves with a weekly cabaret.
Three survivors of that time in August 1944...
...returned for the first time in 50 years.
All, like the Franks, had been captured in hiding.
It is maybe unbelievable...
...but when we were arrested and brought to the prison...
Sal de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...I cannot say it was a kind of relief. No.
But there was something that we said:
"Now this is maybe the end of the war. "
Because we knew the invasion was going on...
...and, "The end is finally in sight.
What we have to do now is try to survive this. "
It was overwhelming.
I knew it was Westerbork.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder
Westerbork Prisoner June/Sept 1944
I thought, "This is the end," because
I knew what happened in Germany.
And I knew that they were going to kill us.
We never gave up hope that we would survive the war.
Rose de Liema
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
There was not that much
Gestapo supervision in the camps.
The first ones I saw were the Franks.
I knew Margot rather well...
Bloeme Evers-Emden
Westerbork Prisoner Aug/Sept 1944
...and I knew Anne.
We said to each other,
"You too, here? You too?
Were you hidden? What happened?"
But very soon you were taken inside the camp...
...and you had to be registered...
...and you got your wooden shoes...
...because we were punished, because we were hidden.
For me, it was the best time of the war.
No hunger, nice boys.
Frieda Menco
Westerbork Prisoner July/Sept 1944
We worked during the daytime.
Wasn't bad.
Then we got food...
...and we were standing around and making jokes with each other.
Like other prisoners, the eight...
...were given make-work jobs by their captors.
The Franks had the task of breaking up old batteries for recycling.
Otto Frank wanted something better for his Anne.
I was cleaning a table...
...and then at once, somebody came to me...
...with a girl-
That was Otto Frank.
Later on, I knew it.
He was with Anne, and he asked me:
"Here's Anne, my daughter.
Do you have work for her?"
Because he wanted, of course, her to be inside with us.
Then she said to me, "I can help you.
I'm very handy. I can do everything. "
This was the end, actually.
This was it.
It all started here.
My grandparents...
...all my uncles, my aunts, my nieces, my nephews...
...all my friends.
They came here, and it was the beginning of the end.
And I really...
...feel like this is...
...a big cemetery.
In the end, you start to believe that it won't happen.
You know that there are transports going each Tuesday.
But when two months have passed...
...and your own name wasn't on the list, you start to believe:
"We can stay here until the end of the war. "
Because by then of course, we knew that there would be an end.
Although it was incredible, but we knew...
...that the English and the Americans were already in Europe.
And then it came, and you became very factual.
You took your things, everything-
You got back what belonged to you...
...because they had taken that away from you...
...because they gave you that outfit.
It was like what happened so many times later. It was like having-
I don't know how you call it. You don't quite realize what's going on...
...and what will happen with you and to you.
Eighty-three trains left Westerbork during the second World War...
...for the Polish death camps of Auschwitz and Sobibor.
On September 3, 1944, they loaded many of the Jews in Westerbork...
...onto the very last transport to Auschwitz.
1019 men, women and children...
...amongst them, the group of eight from the secret annex.
For most, it was to be their last sight of Holland.
Darkness...
...is the first thing I think about.
Being cramped in.
Too many people.
No room enough.
Luggage.
No possibility to lie.
Sitting for three days.
Now and then standing.
You were like in a trance.
You didn't realize.
You realized that very bad things were to happen...
...and to be completely powerless.
Sometimes we stood up. We got up...
...and looked through cracks...
...when we were at a station when the train stopped.
Because we still had no idea how we went and where it would end...
...and how long it would take.
People cried, and on the other side, they told stories to each other...
...to try to sleep, to sleep standing.
There was not enough food and drink.
We were, I think, about 40 or 50 people...
...in that cattle car.
We were standing.
Sometimes we got to our knees to rest a little bit.
Urinating and other things.
I don't remember what we did, but there was nothing there, nothing.
I think we just let it go.
And it was like an endless journey.
And even that was better than that there would have come an end to it.
Because the end was not good.
That, we felt.
Your imagination stops...
...at certain moments.
You refuse to imagine the worst.
On September 5, the train from
Holland reached its final destination:
Auschwitz death camp in southwest Poland.
All those lamps.
Terrible, terrible hard.
The color was so terrible.
It was yellowish.
And we came there, men, women, children alike...
...on the platform here.
Don't know where exactly.
Yeah, I see there, the rail.
We were astonished.
I really thought I passed away, and this was hell.
Really, I thought, "I'm already dead. "
We were driven one way or another way.
After all, was the one way to the death...
...and this was to a kind of life.
I remember very well too...
...that you were naked before men...
...and I was educated chastely...
...in the values of my people.
And I got a shock.
I knew that from this moment on...
...all your norms and values...
...were of no importance anymore.
And that there was a quite new...
...set of values to be learned.
And if you didn't learn it, you would be dead.
I remember that I realized it in one second.
And I was only 18 years old.
According to Auschwitz records, more than half the people on that train...
...were gassed on the day after their arrival, September 6.
549 Jews, among them...
...every child under the age of 15.
They told us right away what was waiting for us: death.
"All of your people, they're going to the chimneys. Maybe tonight already. "
It was just a death factory.
We knew.
We saw that terrible pipe...
...burning day and night.
The smell. I thought that when it should come here...
...that I should have had a penetrant smell. But no.
I was sure that I should smell it because sometimes I smell it.
The smell of the disinfection, the smell of the burning flesh...
...and the smoke.
Anne, Margot and Edith Frank, and Mrs. van Pels...
...were among the 212 women from the Dutch train...
...who were granted entry into that hell they called Auschwitz-Birkenau.
They were placed in Women's Block 29.
It was no life.
It was no life at all.
We were degraded...
...to even less than beasts.
Less than animals.
We were standing outside, and I saw a wagon on the first day.
"What's he throwing on there?"
Dead bodies. Oh, my God!
I could hardly look.
The next couple of days later, I saw it.
"Oh, there's that wagon again who picks up the dead bodies. "
The next time, I didn't pay any attention to that wagon.
So your brain starts functioning differently...
...because if you didn't-
You didn't do it on purpose...
...but then you couldn't go on living.
In Auschwitz-Birkenau, Edith Frank and her daughters...
...were drawn together as never before.
A very important survival...
...for all the people in concentration camps...
...were the forming of groups.
Support groups.
And of course, as mother and children and daughters...
...you were a natural support group.
And I think everything from the past was faded away...
...against this scene of Auschwitz.
It was of no importance anymore, I suppose.
Was there any sign of the previous antagonism...
...between Anne and her mother?
I think it was all forgotten.
They were always together.
You can have the luxury...
...of a struggle with your mother in normal circumstances.
These circumstances were so...
...bad. Not only bad...
...but like a ghost writing...
...that everything fell away.
I'm quite sure about that.
The last time I saw Anne and Margot and Mrs. Frank...
...was when there had been a selection...
...for a working camp.
But you never knew for what the selection was.
But Anne and her mother were told...
...that Anne was not allowed to go with our group...
...because she had scabies.
Her mother and Margot decided to stay with Anne.
We went to a labor camp where we...
...didn't get food and worked hard...
...but most of us survived.
There were few deaths, and there were no gas chambers.
Had she not had the scabies...
...and had they gone with our transport...
...they had had a better chance to survive.
So because Anne suffered from scabies...
...and her mother and sister stayed with her...
...they lost their chance to leave
Auschwitz for the work camp...
...where many of the Dutch women saw out the remainder of the war.
As for the men, when they had first arrived at Auschwitz, September 5...
...Otto Frank, Hermann and
Peter van Pels, and Fritz Pfeffer...
...together with the other 254 males who had not immediately been gassed...
...had been separated from their women and taken to the nearby Auschwitz I.
This, the original death camp created from an old Polish army barracks...
...may have been smaller than
Auschwitz-Birkenau...
...where the women had remained within sight of the gas chambers...
...and three crematoria, but life here for the men was no easier.
Mr. van Pels was the first to wither.
We told him, "Don't give up. "
He did, and it was just like he melted away. It was two weeks-
Two days, he was gone.
He gave up.
That was it.
No one knows exactly when they took
Hermann van Pels to the gas chamber...
...but it was only a few weeks after his arrival at Auschwitz.
Otto Frank and Sal de Liema resolved...
...to keep up their morale by whatever means.
People around us...
...like we all were, of course very nervous.
Talking about food all the time.
Talking about clothes...
...that we didn't have any, practically no clothes.
Only the striped clothes that we had.
The food was just a piece of bread that they'd give you. It was really bad.
So Mr. Frank and I-
We knew each other from Westerbork.
He said, "We should get away from those people...
...because if you start talking about food and everything...
...your brain is gonna go. "
And we said, "We understand that physically...
...we maybe will not survive this. "
We should try to...
...survive mentally...
...and talk about things that had nothing to do with the camp, like:
"Do you remember the melody from the 9th Symphony from Beethoven?"
And then we start singing to each other...
...just to get away from this fear.
Just to get our brain...
...thinking about other things.
We talked about van Gogh, Rembrandt.
"Ever go to the Van Gogh Museum?
Ever go to the Rijk Museum?"
And all those things, just not to-
To get out of our minds.
To get out of this here.
And it really helped, I think.
He was older, much older than I was.
He said, "You know, why don't you call me Papa Frank...
...because I have to have something in my life...
...that I can be a papa to. "
I didn't know what he was talking about.
I said, "What do you mean?
I have a father...
...and he is hidden in the Netherlands, in Holland.
If you do it for me, you don't have to, because I have already a father...
...and he's alive.
I know he's hidden. "
"No," he said, "you do it for me.
I'm the type of a man, I need this.
I need somebody to be a papa for. "
So I told him, "If it will help you, I'll do that. "
He said, "Call me Papa Frank. " Until he died, when he wrote his letters...
...he always signed his letters,
"Papa Frank. "
I was standing one time in the snow...
...naked...
...after we came back from our work.
We stand appell here, outside here...
...and a German soldier came...
...and he had his fur coat on and he looked at me and said:
"Cold, huh? It is cold?"
I didn't even answer.
I just looked at him.
And he said, "You know you will not survive this, you know that.
But in case you will survive-
But I'll take care of it that it's not gonna happen.
Nobody, but nobody will believe you...
...what we did to you people. Nobody. "
Otto Frank interviewed in 1979
One day in Auschwitz,
I was very depressed.
I had been beaten the day before...
...and that had really affected me...
...also in terms of my morale.
It was a Sunday morning...
...and I said, "I can't get up. "
And then my comrades...
...all Dutchmen of course...
...because I was the only German...
...among Dutchmen...
...but I was totally accepted by the others...
...they said to me,
"That's not possible...
...you must get up, otherwise you are lost. "
And then they went to a Dutch doctor...
...who worked with a German doctor...
...and this Dutch doctor...
...came to me in my barracks.
He said, "Get up and come...
...tomorrow morning to the sick barracks...
...and I'll speak to the German doctor...
...so that you will be accepted. "
And that is what happened...
...and through that I was saved.
While Otto languished in a sick barracks...
...his daughters were transported away.
On October 28, 1944, they were separated from their mother...
...and together with 1308 other women, they were sent here...
...to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.
Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder was with them.
You see with your own eyes how beautiful it is. It is beautiful.
And there were birds here.
And I wanted to be a bird.
Freedom, freedom, freedom.
I thought, "Oh, how nice to be a bird.
You can fly wherever you go. "
I was simply jealous of birds.
When Anne, Margot, Rachel and the others arrived at Bergen-Belsen...
...the camp was overflowing...
...with new inmates brought from throughout Europe.
The barracks being built to accommodate them were not ready...
...and they were crammed into the makeshift shelter of tents.
On November 7, a violent storm raged through the camp...
...destroying many of these.
Seeking shelter from the rain...
...Anne and Margot encountered
Lientje and Janny Brilleslijper...
...the two Dutch sisters whom they knew from Auschwitz and Westerbork.
It stormed, it hailed.
We had walked four kilometers...
...and we sat together...
...the two of us...
...with only our two little faces...
...sticking out of two blankets.
Those dark horse blankets...
...with our heads together...
...and only our two little faces...
...like two heaps on a little hill...
...up against a tree...
...to stay as dry as possible.
And four legs came walking up...
...also with blankets around them...
...and over their heads.
And at the same time as we saw them...
...we all threw off our blankets with a shout...
"Oh, how wonderful that you are here. "
How can you find something wonderful...
...in the middle of a concentration camp?
Deliberately starved, frozen and racked with disease...
...Bergen-Belsen was no place to be in those last months of World War II.
A wooden barracks was found for the unfortunate women from Auschwitz.
But Anne and Margot Frank came to be in the worst position of all:
In the lower bunk next to the door.
Incapable of protecting themselves...
...from the vicious wind that swept through Bergen-Belsen's barren acres.
They shouted, "Close the door!
Close the door!
It is cold! It is cold!
It is cold!"
And it was terrible for them, of course.
What did the Frank girls look like when you saw them in the barracks?
Very terrible. Terrible. Sick.
Thin. No hair.
Their eyes, very big. Very big eyes because they were so thin.
Almost impossible to imagine...
...but there was a time when the name Bergen-Belsen...
...brought hope to the eyes of Jews due to be transported here.
In the early years, the Nazis planned it as a camp for Jews...
...who might be used for exchange for German prisoners of war.
In those long ago days, Anne's friend
Lies Goslar had been sent here...
...with her sister and father, the former
German government minister.
In 1945, Lies discovered she was in the compound...
...next to the Dutch women from Auschwitz.
One day, a friend of mine tells me:
"You know, between all these women, there is your friend, Anne Frank. "
I don't know, I felt very crazy...
...because I was thinking the whole time:
"Anne is safe in Switzerland. "
I was sure of this. This was what the tenant said to me.
And so I had no choice to go also near this barbed wire.
This was not allowed, and the German in the watchtower was watching us.
And you know he would have shot if he would have caught us.
So we couldn't see. I told you there were barbed wire with straw...
...and we couldn't see the other side.
So I just went near at dark...
...and I start to call,
"Hello? Hello?" Something like this.
And who answered me was Mrs. van Pels.
Maybe the Dutch women went near the barbed wire...
...because the others didn't know anybody. I don't know.
I didn't even ask her, "How are you?"
I knew her, but not very good.
But immediately she said to me,
"You want Anne?" And I said, "Yes. "
And she says, "You know,
I will call her for you.
Margot I can't call for you.
She's very sick already.
But Anne I will call for you. "
And so I was standing there in the cold, and I was waiting.
And then suddenly, I heard somebody calling me...
...and it was Anne.
And this was awful.
The first thing, we both started to cry. Then I said:
"What are you doing here?
You are in Switzerland. "
And she answered me, "We wanted this rumor to go around...
...because we hoped then the Germans will not look after us. "
And then she said she had nobody anymore.
And this was not right, and I am so very sorry because she said:
"My mother is dead. " And her mother really was dead at that moment...
...but she couldn't know. She was sure her mother was killed when she left.
But her mother came out later, was not killed...
...she just died of exhaustion in the beginning of January.
Her sister, she knew, was very, very sick already.
But now her father.
Look, if it was Mengele or somebody else...
...they wouldn't know how old you are.
They would see only naked bodies.
And Mr. Frank was 55 years old...
...but he was only one month in the Dutch camp...
...so he looked still very good.
And the Germans just looked and saw somebody that still can walk...
...so they sent him to the right, to live.
But Anne thought they go by the age, and she was sure of it.
"My father is dead. He is an old man. "
And I always think, if she had known her father is still alive-
After her sister died, she just was without any hope.
Then maybe she had-
You know, it was only...
...one month she died before the liberation.
But she didn't know, and so she had really nothing to live for.
At this time, as a special prisoner being kept for possible exchange...
...Lies Goslar received a parcel from the Red Cross.
My friends, everybody gave me a glove or a little sock and a little bread.
So I came back at night with such a small package.
And then I hear her again, and we were speaking.
I told her about my little sister.
I told her my mother wasn't alive anymore. She didn't know.
Miep only told her that my-
That the baby died.
And my father was then already in hospital.
He died 25 of February, and this was before.
And I throw the package over...
...and then I heard her crying or shouting.
And I couldn't understand.
"What happened?"
"The lady next to me caught the package, and she run away with it. "
And she didn't give her anything.
I said, "I will try for another time. "
And really, I tried another time.
And this time she caught the package.
And it was the last time I saw her.
More than 50,000 of Bergen-Belsen's inmates died in 1945...
...as disease and starvation ravaged the camp.
Typhus, carried by lice, was a particularly horrible killer.
It is terrible when you are covered in lice.
Anne had thrown away her clothes...
...and she came to us crying...
...wrapped only in her gray blanket.
Lientje (my sister) lay sick...
...and I couldn't do anything...
...except give Anne some clothes to wear...
...and give her some delousing material.
And I promised to come to her the next day...
...to come to both of them...
...because she said,
"You have to come.
Margot is so ill. "
At that time...
...Margot was already mortally sick.
I suppose she also had typhus.
I'm not sure.
But the next day,
I couldn't get away...
...and it took at least four or five days...
...before I went to her...
...and then they were already dead.
Both dead.
And all of a sudden...
...I didn't see them anymore.
But you would not pay attention.
The place was empty.
We were sick.
And when I was ill, to speak about myself...
...is why I couldn't pay more attention than I did.
They're not there anymore.
They are dead.
That was that.
Outside in the entry guard...
...all of them were swept away.
Boom. They are outside.
I don't know whether I can talk about it.
Meat was traded...
...bodies.
It's very difficult...
Leave it.
I can't say any more.
The bodies from our barracks...
...we almost couldn't lift them anymore.
They were thrown onto a pile...
...between the barracks...
...and inscribed on my eyes...
...are these people...
...in every possible position...
...in every possible form...
...covered in snow...
...completely naked...
...because they would always be undressed.
On a pile with wide open eyes.
We tried to close as many eyes as possible.
It didn't always work.
Bergen-Belsen, as filmed by British liberators:
A place where humanity had been reduced to the worst indignities.
Cannibalism became part of a desperate struggle...
...to quench the most appalling hunger.
Only a few hundred yards away...
...the Germans kept supplies of food and medicine...
...while their prisoners died by the tens of thousands.
In November 1943, a year and a half before her death...
...in the safety of her
Amsterdam hiding place...
...Anne Frank had a nightmare in which
Hanneli Goslar appeared before her.
Hanneli Goslar in a concentration camp.
"I saw her there, dressed in rags...
...her face thin and worn.
She looked at me with such sadness and reproach in her enormous eyes...
...that I could read the message in them:
'Oh, Anne, why have you deserted me?
Help me, help me.
Rescue me from this hell. '
And I can't help her.
I can only stand by and watch...
...while other people suffer and die.
All I can do is pray to God to bring her back to us.
If only I could help her.
Dear God, I have everything
I could wish for...
...while fate has her in its deadly clutches.
Hanneli, Hanneli. If only
I could take you away.
If only I could share everything I have with you.
It's too late, but I'll never forget her again...
...and I'll always pray for her.
Yours, Anne. "
She didn't do so much wrong, you know, if you are in this age.
But this is one of the reasons that I tell the story now...
...because it is the other way around.
Yes, today I am standing here, and she is dead.
And so I am quite obliged to tell about her.
And she wanted to be so very famous.
I can't help a lot of this but a little bit.
I think, "What a waste, such a young life should end...
...and without any reason. "
She could really have given something to the world.
The whole thing is crazy.
My father died there one week after I saw her.
I don't know.
I cannot judge this whole period.
Nobody can understand it, I think.
I don't know.
Auschwitz had been liberated two and a half months before Bergen-Belsen.
On a freezing January 27, 1945...
...a Ukrainian division of the Soviet army, accompanied by a film crew...
...arrived at the site of the most successful mass murder...
...in mankind's history.
The last SS guards had already fled...
...leaving behind only those too young or infirm...
...to be led away on the now-notorious death marches.
The gassings at Auschwitz had already stopped the previous November.
The gas chambers dynamited.
But in a wild attempt to cover their tracks...
...the SS dragged thousands away with them in desperate flight...
...in the biting cold.
Those of the prisoners who could not keep up...
...were shot at the side of the road by their German escort.
Tens of thousands perished
"somewhere in Europe" of hunger...
...thirst or exhaustion, or from an SS bullet.
Fritz Pfeffer had been amongst those taken away before the Russians came...
...to die on December 20, 1944...
...in Neuengamme concentration camp in Germany.
Anne's boyfriend from the days in the annex, Peter van Pels...
...was marched out of Auschwitz by the Germans on January 16...
...and taken to Mauthausen death camp in Austria...
...where he died on May 5, 1945...
...just three days before the Americans liberated that camp.
His mother, Auguste van Pels, was sent on a crazy journey...
...across Germany and Czechoslovakia.
First to Bergen-Belsen, then to Theresienstadt.
And in the last days of the Reich...
...to an unknown camp, where she too died.
One of the millions of anonymous bodies left...
...by Hitler's failed vision of a thousand-year empire.
Otto Frank, weighing less than 115 pounds...
...was amongst the lucky few that the Russians found alive in Auschwitz.
When he was recovered, Otto wrote to his mother in Switzerland...
...where she had lived since before the war.
His letters then remained forgotten...
...in the attic of her home in Basle for nearly 50 years...
...until they were discovered by his nephew in May 1994.
"Auschwitz, 23 February 1945.
Dearest Mother: Hopefully these lines will reach you...
...bringing you and all my loved ones the news...
...that I have been liberated by the Russians...
...that I am healthy and in good spirits...
...and that I am being well taken care of.
I do not know where Edith and the children are.
We have been separated since September 5, 1944.
I just hope to see them back in good health.
I'm longing to see you all again and hope that this will be possible soon.
All my love, greetings and kisses.
Your son, Otto. "
So it was that Otto Frank, the only survivor...
...of the eight who had been in hiding in Amsterdam...
...took the long journey back to his Dutch adopted homeland.
By May, with the war in Europe ended...
...his Russian liberators had sent him...
...to the Black Sea port of Odessa.
There, he was placed on a New Zealand merchant ship...
...bound for France.
"May 26, 1945.
The steamer Monowai.
Dearest Mother and all you loved ones:
Tomorrow we arrive in Marseilles, and this letter can hopefully be mailed.
I imagine I will be able to telegraph you...
...so that you will get the news of my return in good health.
All my hope is the children.
I cling to the conviction that they are alive...
...and that we will be together again.
Unfortunately, Edith did not survive.
She died on January 6, 1945...
...in the hospital, of starvation.
Her body could not withstand attack of influenza.
The closer we get to home, the more impatient we get...
...to hear news of our loved ones.
What happened in all these years!
We own nothing anymore.
We won't find a pin when we get back.
Bernd Elias
Otto Frank's nephew
The Germans stole everything.
No photograph, letter or document will remain there.
Financially, we had no worries during the last years.
I earned good money and saved.
Now all is gone.
But I don't worry about this.
We have gone through too much to worry about things like that.
Only the children.
The children are what count.
I hope to get news from you straightaway.
Maybe you already have news of the girls.
I cannot write about everything that I am thinking of.
I have to stay in Holland as...
...with the exception of a tattooed number on my arm...
...I have no papers and therefore must think of seeing you later.
The main thing is that we have contact.
We hope to see each other soon.
With innermost greetings and kisses and love, your Otto. "
My husband worked on the station...
Miep Gies
...registering all the people who are coming down from...
...the concentration camps.
And he ask everyone:
"Have you seen Mr. Frank?
Have you heard about Mr. Frank?"
And one day, one evening, he came home and he said:
"I have good news for you.
Otto Frank is coming home. "
And when he said this, we lived downstairs.
Mr. Frank came...
...along the window.
I ran to the door.
At first what I ask was:
"Where's Edith?"
Otto Frank said to me,
"Edith never come...
...but I have hope for the children. "
And he came to us.
Because he had no house, no nothing...
...he lived seven years in our house.
But the life go on.
We go every day...
...to the office.
But I do not give him the diary of Anne Frank.
You may not know this...
...but when he was on the ship...
...from Odessa to Marseilles...
...Otto wrote a letter to his mother.
In that letter he said this:
"Kugler and Kleiman, and especially Miep...
...her husband and Bep Voskuijl cared for us for two years...
...with everything we needed...
...in spite of the dangers...
...and unprecedented sacrifices they made.
One cannot describe it.
I will never be able to repay what all these people have done. "
I never know about this. No.
That is the first time...
...I heard it. Thank you.
While Miep kept the diary secret from
Otto in case Anne should return...
...he was desperate to find his daughters.
He advertised in newspapers and visited the Dutch Red Cross...
...asking, always asking for news of Anne and Margot.
At the end of July, he was told that someone knew of their fate.
In August, he had the tragic news confirmed.
He stood on the porch and rang the bell...
...and remained standing on the porch.
He said, "Are you Janny Brandes?"
And I said, "Yes. "
"Can I come in?"
Because he was a very polite gentleman.
He came into the hallway...
...and remained standing there and said:
"What happened to my daughters?
I am Otto. "
I could hardly speak...
...because it was very difficult...
...to tell someone...
...that his children were not alive anymore.
I said, "They are no more. "
He turned deathly pale...
...and slumped down into a chair.
I just put my arm around him.
When the girls' death had been confirmed...
...Miep gave up the secret she kept hidden from Otto...
...since the day of the family's capture more than a year before.
From her top drawer, she handed him...
...three books and a sheaf of loose papers:
Anne's diary, which she herself had never read.
I took the diary...
...out of my desk...
...and gave him it with the words:
"That is a testament for your daughter Anne. "
Can you look?
Can you see how this man looked at me?
Lost his wife.
Lost his two children.
He had the diary.
Otto transcribed sections of the diary for his mother in Switzerland.
He also started showing it to friends...
...seeking their views on what to do with his daughter's unique legacy.
They all advised him to have it published...
...but his efforts met with no success.
Then this article, written by a friend of a friend...
...appeared in an Amsterdam paper in April 1946...
...and finally, a publisher stepped forward.
Het Achterhuis, "The Back House, " appeared in June 1947.
Initially, it made little impact.
Then in the 1950s...
...German, French, English and other translations began to appear.
In 1955, a stage adaptation opened on
Broadway to a rapturous reception.
The transformation of the 15-year-old
German-Jewish refugee...
...into an emblem of the Holocaust gathered pace.
A 1959 feature film based on the play added further to this process.
To some, she had become little short of a saint.
But her diary, at the very least, had become a publishing phenomenon.
In 1953, Otto had remarried and moved to Switzerland.
In the absence of Anne, he became the focus for his daughter's celebrity.
He, in turn, came to symbolize the perfect father so many children crave.
Thousands wrote to him from around the world...
...and he replied to each individually.
If young people are writing to me after reading the diary...
Otto Frank interviewed in 1976
...I start to think:
"That is, for me, one of the most precious. "
Though Otto developed relationships, sometimes close ones...
...with many of the children who wrote to him...
...he admitted he never understood his own daughter in her lifetime.
Was she in fact the optimist and cheerful person that he saw as a child?
She showed herself like that.
But in fact, I only learned to know her really...
...through her diary.
Throughout these years, one persistent problem refused to go away:
Citing differences between different language versions of the diary...
...which were never explained in the various editions...
...together with further fictional scenes in the play and film...
...neo-Nazis around the world...
...wanting to throw doubt on the very existence of the Holocaust...
...alleged that the diary was a hoax.
Painful and inconclusive lawsuits followed...
...but it was only in 1980, after Otto's death...
...that the authenticity of the diary was finally tested scientifically.
The extensive report by the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation...
...took five years to complete and was eventually published...
...with a study of all the versions of Anne's diary.
It categorically stated that the diary was genuine in every respect.
In 1960, one of Holland's most secret places became one of its most public.
The Franks' annex was opened as a museum...
...and is now visited by over
600,000 tourists a year.
Otto also created charitable foundations...
...to perpetuate Anne's message to the world.
Anne was not simply to be commemorated...
...but her short life was to become a more general force for good.
To fight against prejudice and discrimination...
...and hatred against people of different race and religion.
Since 1985, a touring exhibition...
...telling Anne's life story and its relevance to current world affairs...
...has traveled from country to country, from Moscow to Minneapolis...
...South America to South Africa.
It has also shown that the diary has had some surprising readers...
...in surprising places.
During the many years my comrades and I spent in prison...
Nelson Mandela
President of South Africa
Political Prisoner 1964-1990
...we derived inspiration from the courage and tenacity...
...of those who challenge injustice...
...even under the most difficult circumstances.
Some of us read Anne Frank's diary on Robben Island...
...and derived much encouragement from it.
It's very interesting...
...the letters of the German children.
They always ask me everything...
...because they wrote me:
"My father or grandfather...
...didn't tell me anything about the war.
They say always, 'That is the past.
That is over. "'
But that is not true.
The past goes always with you...
...in your whole life, and we can learn from the past.
In 1941, there was a wedding at Merwedeplein in Amsterdam.
After filming the street...
...the cameraman pointed at the onlookers above.
There at the window was Anne Frank.
This is the only known moving footage of her.
When she stood at the window that sunny day in June...
...it's not surprising that the 12-year-old Anne Frank...
...was yet to find her life's purpose.
But less than three years later, as she sat caged...
...in the fragile security of her hiding place...
...she had discovered her destiny.
"Wednesday, April 5, 1944.
My dearest Kitty:
I don't want to have lived in vain like most people.
I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to people...
...even those I've never met.
I want to go on living, even after my death.
And that's why I'm grateful to God for having given me this gift...
...which I can use to develop and to express...
...all that's inside me.
Yours, Anne M. Frank. "
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, we still do it.
We also mark our faces and skin.
We paint everything... the jaguar, the fish.
Only after five days....
First we put paint... then charcoal.
It lasts five days.
About four or five days old.
Yes, I did.
Kuberene... and Iroa.
Yes, we played.
I don't remember, it was too long ago.
Kuberene was kind of a sad boy, but a good person.
The other boy was more cheerful... enjoyed playing.
One was more joyful, the other sad.
Yes, they had families.
The aruanas were immortal fishes that lived in hidden lakes inside the earth.
One day, though, Hariua, a smart young aruana... found a shaft of sunlight.
Immediately he remembered the wise advise of Kobehi, the oldest shaman:
''Avoid the shaft of sunlight that comes through a long, narrow, stony path.''
''It leads to suffering, pain, danger and death!''
But a strong feeling of curiosity took the young aruana closer....
We don't have... any written education... we get our knowledge from our parents and families.
They teach us about our destiny, about being an Indian... being a human being, and about life.
If we don't respect our elders... we'll be lost.
We really have to fight to try to maintain the maximum possible... of our culture, our language, our dances.
During the years of colonialism... the whites wanted us to be their slaves.
During the republic they tried... to change us into whites overnight.
They put the hospital here, the hotel, the school... the machines.
We were confused... not knowing how to live in this new situation... and after the years... of white man's civilization... we have to defend ourselves. But how?
By learning something from the whites, in the school.
Yesterday, an Indian... was wounded deep in his back.
He was in great pain.
We'll see if we will have to operate.
I'm seeing an airplane.
It's coming down from the sky.
We teach our children to read.
First in our language, Karaja, then in Portuguese.
Two languages at the same time.
We want to learn only the good things from the whites.
We don't want to live in the town... because there we would learn only... the bad things the whites are doing.
That's why we teach our children, so that won't happen.
Yes.
I liked it very much, I was very happy.
It touched me.
My feelings...
I have missed him a lot since I lost him.
And now, when I saw him...
I was very happy indeed.
I've been feeling so sad... and this was great for me.
It was great to see him alive.
I wish I could still see him.
When I saw him moving...
I felt he was alive again.
My father was killed... when a crocodile attacked him.
It was down at the lake.
He was fishing... with two friends.
He was steering the canoe.
The water was very low.
When the canoe passed over a crocodile... it went crazy and attacked my father... right at his neck.
Yes.
In this village... a lot of things have changed since your last visit.
But for me the saddest thing is that I've lost my husband.
I feel very lonely...
I miss the safety he gave me.
I remember long ago, one night he came into my hut... and the next morning we were husband and wife.
And so he stayed with me.
He was a very good person, very kind and hard working.
April 7th: 1939
Italian troops disembark on the other side of the Adriatic and the political union between ltaly and Albania is made in the name of Fascism.
The history of those days is very significant.
April 12th: the Albanian AssembIy decides to offer the King of Italy the Albanian Crown.
April 14th: the government sanction the new title.
ApriI 15th: the Fascist CounciI approve the union.
April 23rd: Albanese Fascist Party is founded at Tirana.
ApriI 29th: the AIbanese Council decides union of both Armies.
After the union of Armed Forces, other joint initiatives follow.
Courts are organised, schools and hospitals founded.
RuraI health centres are created to help peasants fight malaria.
There is Iand-drainage and roads, housing for the peasants, and at Iast, thanks to ltaIy among the robust Albanians civilization takes its place.
The landing at Durazzo and the arrivaI of the Duce's men who find throughout Albania a most cordiaI and enthusiastic welcome from the people, awe-struck by the martiaI presence of the Duce's guards.
Setting off immediately for Tirana
Ciano, the Foreign Secretary is greeted with enthusiasm as representative of the great nation which ended the misgovernment of King Zog and the poverty of the people.
An account which was waiting to be settled.
Italy, Italy, you are the world!
Hello, Mr. Fiore!
Hello, how are you?
- What a lovely car.
- How much does it cost?
A Iot...
Let's hurry, they're expecting us at the Ministry.
You'Il get hurt!
When Albania was communist, was like prison, no one came in or went out for fifty years.
Now foreigners can enter but Albanians cannot go out.
Where would you go anyway?
You think they're waiting for you in Germany or Italy?
Too much freedom alI at once is not good.
- Who's in power now?
- Same as before.
They just change name, they get rid of the older ones, the more corrupt but people are hungry and desperate.
You've been spoilt, the State has always taken care of everything.
The truth is that the time has come to rolI your sleeves up and get busy.
Don't get me wrong, I don't mean you must do it aIl yourseIves...
But do you know what Albanian salary is?
Ten dollars!
A doctor gets fifteen!
- There's no capitaI.
- The capital's coming...
Hope so...
These people come down from the mountains and from borders with Yugoslavia.
They walk for miles and miles to get to port.
The police try to stop them, but it's no use.
What do you need all these bunkers for?
Our dictator Hoxha feared Italian invasion, so he bought 600 thousand from communist China.
Know how many houses that cement would make?
Yes, but Hoxha was mad, he was dictator.
Dictator my arse!
It's brains you're lacking!
How the helI can you be starving?
With all this land, all the oil and water you have... the sea!
AlI this farmland, with intensive farming you can harvest...
At Ieast three tons per hectare!
Will our friend see us today?
Yes, he's ready to sign contract.
Others will come if not...
Soldiers, eh?
Movement of troops?
- But the situation is under controI?
- Sort of.
Easy kids, easy, easy...
The best room.
Everything clean...
New curtains...
AI Bano and Romina sIept here.
- They big success in Albania.
- Good for them.
I chose these people speciaIIy for you, aIl reIiabIe.
- Are they okay politically?
- Yes, anti-communist heroes.
How do you say "good morning"?
- Did you explain why we need them?
- Not yet.
- How come there's a woman too?
- She's very popular in Albania.
- She was first to push breast...
- Bust.
Our dictator's bust off the pedestal.
Tell them we'll see them later...
I'm going to take a shower.
I'm afraid no water today, holiday today, maybe tomorrow.
They've got ltalian TV!
Do you like ltalian shoes?
Soft leather, modern manufacturing, feet wrapped in velvet.
She say ltalian shoes best in world, she see on television.
We must give every
Albanian a pair of shoes.
We'll use IocaI manpower in the factory, and choice Albanian skins: lamb, kid, calf...
And you will be the chairman of our company, Alba Calzature.
You're sure she isn't married?
Husband dead, she widow, no children, no relatives, sisters, brothers...
No mother and father, she better than alI.
You'Il work with us as from tomorrow, happy?
- Thank you, sir.
- Now give me a big smile.
Look, her name's Selimi, Iike him.
- Are you related?
- No.
Cousins of third degree.
Cousin of third degree.
I mustn't get angry.
I mustn't get angry.
I mustn't get angry.
So, we're trying to be smart, are we?
Albania's got smart asses too!
- Send her away.
- First people with a degree!
Now your cousin! Are you trying to pulI one over on me?
If she goes, I go too, because I'm honest man.
She is my cousin, but distant cousin, very distant.
No one's forcing us to invest in this country, we can just pack up and go home.
If you think I am dishonest man, find someone else.
If it can't be done, it can't be done, don't insist.
In my village there was an old lady who begged in the streets.
And this man, to avoid taxes, registered two hotels in her name.
Hotels... old woman...
Would you give money to people with relatives who would cheat you the day after?
Now do you understand what we need?
What do you calI them?
We need a man of straw...
Someone who'll do as we say.
That's not difficult with all the poor people you have here.
Don't you have old people's homes?
Where do you keep old people?
The director asks why we need this man we look for.
To shake western public opinion.
The man could be the symbol of a new Albania.
He ask if he go on ltalian TV.
Of course!
Six months ago here work only political prisoners.
They heroes because they fight against communist dictator.
Here they are.
Now you see only disaster but before, when prison worked well, it was different.
It was modeI Iabour camp.
The previous director was very strict on hygiene.
The prisoners made their beds and cleaned the room every day.
He's sick with arthrosis, stomach, heart, everything.
Once they de-ratted every month.
It wasn't like this, conditions much better.
- What's he saying?
- You have nice shoes.
Prisoners had to take shower every day, it was compulsory.
In evening there was inspection, prisoners not clean were punished.
Because old director say:
"Men not clean have lice, men with lice don't sleep well.
Men who don't sleep well, don'twork well."
- What's he saying?
- Nothing important.
He say this place is dangerous.
He wants to clear everyone out and set fire to it, because there is danger of disease and infection.
An epidemic even.
What kind of fucking place is this? Please, don't touch me.
What do you want?
Please, don't touch me!
Please, let me through!
Let me through!
Get me out of here!
Get me out!
Every evening he take his stuff, he say goodbye to his friends:
"I'm going home, I'm going home."
He goes to the gate, stays there until it's dark then comes back inside and say: "Tomorrow I leave".
What's his name?
He frightened, he used to interrogation of politicaI poIice.
Tell him we're not from the police!
Translate... friends!
He's soft in the head, he could be illiterate.
Give me a pen.
Tell him to write his name.
Go on, write your name!
You see, he can sign his name.
- Spiro.
- Spiro Tozai.
What if he has family?
He has no one.
They wouldn't have left him here.
How old is he?
He's twenty.
He says he's twenty.
- What's this officiaI's name?
- Mr. Croce.
Kruja! Please, at least don't get name wrong.
Mr. Kruja very pleased democratic hero will be chairman of your company.
Hero.
Chairman.
Congratulations.
He say you Italians are very good to choosing chairman.
Everything okay, they take him.
Hear that, Mr. Chairman?
We've arrived, get out.
Do you Iike it here?
What have you done?
Get out!
Have you peed yourself?
I'll teach you! Come here!
- He's peed in the car!
- Doesn't matter, he old.
- Take him away!
- He suffered enough.
Just look at that!
Come here.
Clean the seat.
And clean it properly.
He's orphan...
How do you say that in English?
Your home.
Go on, go on...
Go on.
I told them it's a temporary solution until we find him a home.
But if we give them a Iittle extra, they'Il keep him here forever.
I liked him from the start.
He reminds me of my poor dead father, he's just Iike him.
The communists told you we were alI the same.
And I say we are not.
We are all different.
Different Iike the parts of our body.
What do we all have?
We have eyes to see and ears to hear.
What do we need feet for?
We need them for walking.
Then we have a brain to think with.
AII the parts are different but alI necessary.
Well, that is how I'd like this factory to be.
An organism of separate parts, but everyone essentiaI.
Keep stilI.
Try this pecorino, it tastes
Iike ricotta, but it's good.
Not one piece of machinery works here, not one.
Two years ago your father and I went to Nigeria.
We bought an empty warehouse, and formed a company.
Then we sent for some second-hand electronic equipment, and we set up a nice television factory.
Called Niger Electronics and we got a grant from the Italian government.
- Did you make any televisions?
- Not one.
It's not our fault if Africans have no knack for electronics.
Yes, but it's more likely they'll check up on us here.
I'll be at the Ministry in Rome tomorrow, you stay here and register the contracts.
Get the old man and take him to see a doctor, for a tonic or some vitamins.
You never know.
Do the Albanians believe this story about investments?
The Albanians are Iike children.
If an ltalian said: "The sea is made of wine", they'd go and drink it.
Good evening.
Sorry I disturb,
I look in room for you.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing serious.
Little bureaucratic problem.
Our bureaucracy is the same as it was with communism.
What is it now?
The State commission wants to meet the company chairman.
- Why?
- Small formality, more signatures.
We must take old man to Ministry, to our friend Kruja.
He does everything, you just bring old man.
Be here tomorrow morning at nine.
Sorry, I cannot, tomorrow
I busy with German company.
They buy villa in Velona near sea to convert to Iuxury residence.
Very clever.
Albania is poor, we have to do what we can.
Our music is good, also the singer.
Have fun.
- How long has he been missing?
- I'm sure he had dinner last night.
- After that I don't know.
- What?
We left him in your care.
He can hardly walk, you were supposed to look after him.
Please, keep your voice down, people are praying.
Yes, praying...
How can he have disappeared?
- I'Il report you if he's hurt.
- This is not prison.
Mr. Tozai is not a child, he go out if he wish.
That's not what we agreed, he was supposed to stay here day and night.
We gave you a lot of money, now find him or I'll get this place closed.
Our janitor is friend of Mr. Tozai, maybe he know where he go.
Hey you!
- Where did you get that suit?
- Old man give me.
Where is he now?
He cry, he say:
"I want go home".
So I take him to train station.
When?
Not Iong, about half hour.
He take train for Scutari.
Where is the station?
- The station!
- Near here.
Behind building.
He crazy.
He want to go ltaly with train!
Stop! Take your hands off!
Stop!
Get your hands off!
Tell him Mr. Tozai's the chairman of an Italo-Albanian company backed by the Ministry of Industry.
Tell him also that Mr. Tozai is a personal friend of the Minister.
Chief say: too few policemen, too many criminals.
It is difficult to find your friend, very difficult.
He's right...
I know it's difficult.
Perhaps we can come to an agreement...
I'm prepared to pay you for your heIp.
Understand? I'll pay for your help...
Chief say one hand wash other.
- He say he found old ltalian...
- No, I'm looking for an Albanian!
Your friend is in that room down there.
He say he saved old man's life, he bring to hospital.
Is it serious?
- I don't understand, speak ltalian.
- Ah, ltalian.
How do you say...?
Asphyxia but not serious, better now.
- You family?
- No, of course not...
I'm ltalian.
He speaks Italian with me.
So? Everyone here speaks ltalian.
He say to me that he has nice ltalian name.
Talarico.
Talarico Michele.
Spiro Tozai.
His name is Spiro Tozai.
He spent fifty years in jail for politicaI reasons.
These are his papers.
This does not prove,
Albania was colony of
Mussolini before war.
What's Mussolini got to do with it?
Before war, many Italians here. ltalians rule in Albania with Fascism.
After war, communism.
So Italians in prison or...
- Executed?
- Executed.
So, many Italians make false papers.
Maybe he was Italian before, but he's AIbanian now.
What is he for Albanian law?
I not know law,
I am doctor, excuse me.
Can I take him with me?
Can he waIk?
He's worked in a mine, he's strong...
- How much do I owe you?
- Nothing, this is pubIic hospital.
Thank God, at Ieast that...
Where are his shoes?
He had no shoes.
How am I supposed to take him away?
Could you get me some shoes? I'll pay.
I am sorry, I cannot help.
I am sorry. ltalian, cigarette?
Italian, friend.
Keep an eye on the car.
Good morning.
Have you got any coffee?
Is there a telephone?
A bathroom... a toilet...?
Get away from there!
Get out of the car.
Get your rags.
Police, watch the car...
Schiperi Socialiste...
Were they socialist or communist?
Who put you in jail, the socialists or communists?
Did you meddle in politics?
Have you finished? If you pee in my car again, I'Il kiIl you.
Wait, take it easy!
I'm friend, understand?
Easy, I help you and you be good.
If you do as I say nothing will happen to you.
We're friends...
Do you understand?
Perhaps it's best you don't understand.
Wait...
Now you're chairman do you think you can do whatever you want?
We bought you a new suit and here you are in these rags.
What are you doing? Wait!
- Leave me alone.
- What did you say?
Did you say "leave me alone"?
How come you speak Italian?
Perhaps the doctor was right.
She said you weren't Albanian.
She said your name was Michele.
Michele!
What the hell are you?
Are you Albanian or ltalian?
Tell me who the fuck you are!
If your papers say you're
Albanian, that's all right by me.
You're not scared, are you, Mr. Chairman?
You could fire me if you wanted to, just relax...
Let's go.
What the...
Where's the policeman?
What happened to the policeman?
Where the fucking helI is that poIiceman?
Who took my tyres?
You saw who did it, you were right here.
You'd better come up with those tyres or I'll report you!
I'm not leaving here until I get my tyres back.
I'll have you all thrown in jail.
Do you understand me?
You'Il pay for this!
You miserable sods!
You tramps!
Bloody peasants! Wretches!
Fucking Albanians!
Police! I need to find the police station!
Understand? Tyres are gone.
Car don't move! Police, understand?
Car without tyres don't move!
- Police, where?
- Police, there...
I can't go there,
I haven't got any tyres!
Fucking helI!
Wait!
Get off!
Wait!
Get off, come here!
Don't leave yet!
Stop, I want to get off, shit-head!
You no say shit-head!
Take it easy...
What's your name?
My name is lsmaiI.
Please meet you.
I like ltaIy, I like ltaIians.
I friend of Italians: Pippo Baudo,
Frizzi, Adriano CeIentano.
I aIways see Italian TV, even if communism not permit before.
You only sing Italian song and you go prison.
Communism say:
"You sing ltalian song?
Then you see Italian teIevision.
If you see ltalian television, you spy."
- And you, no prison?
- No.
I am clever, I am crafty.
War is ugly, eh?
You must leave your family...
When I Ieft
Rosa she cried.
She was expecting a baby.
I said to her: "Don't cry,
I don't want to go to war".
I'll run away.
I'll come back to you, Rosa.
Who is more important in ltaly, the Pope or the President?
- What do you think?
- I think Pope.
On television always see Pope,
President not so much.
Our dictator say:
"Religion is bad for people".
First he outlaw religion here, but now I go ltaly
I become Christian.
Christians can find work in ltaly, right?
Of course!
Where do you live?
Milan, Rome, Bari?
Police stop bus, they don't want us go port and take ship.
Police!
Police!
I'm ltaIian!
The tyres of my car was stolen!
- Listen!
- Where is your car?
- Somewhere over the hills.
- Go there, we can't do anything.
What do you mean?
You're the police, aren't you?
I'm a foreigner, you must help!
- How far is it to Tirana?
- What?
On foot, one day.
Why on foot? What's this?
Bus don't leave any more, it's sequestered.
Government order that Albanians not escape to Italy anymore.
How can I get to Tirana?
That's your business!
Come on, let's go!
- Poor people...
- Come on, stop that!
- They'II kiII me.
- Who'Il kiIl you?
- What are you talking about?
- They'll kill me.
What? Who's going to kilI you?
The militia.
What militia? Come on out!
- Come on!
- Poor people.
If you stay here, they'Il kiIl you.
I'm going.
If you come with me nothing wilI happen to you.
Come on.
Let go, we're Italians!
Poor people, poor people...
Keep walking!
Paisa', thanks, you saved my Iife.
If the militia had found me, they'd have shot me.
Can I teII you something?
I haven't been discharged,
I ran away from the war.
I'm a deserter.
Paisa', I'm from Sicily.
My name's Talarico Michele.
Fraud...
I have a wife and child.
I must get back to Sicily, but I don't know the way.
I'lI foIlow you, that way I won't get lost.
Where are we now?
Is it very far to SiciIy?
Keep walking!
Do you want to eat?
What's that written on the mountain?
Can't you read either?
"Duce, Mussolini", that's what's written on it.
We must be somewhere in Abruzzo or maybe not, we're near Rome.
Where are we?
In NapIes.
In Naples? Do you think I'm stupid?
Naples is on the coast.
Where's the sea?
They've bombed...
Maybe they've bombed Sicily too.
No, the Lord can't do this to me.
I want to see my son.
He was born the day
I left for the war.
I left in the morning and the rascal was born that evening.
They wouldn't even Iet me see him.
He'II have grown, he'lI be waIking, maybe he's asking about me.
He must be about three.
No, I'm wrong, he's four.
Do you think he'lI recognise me?
Have you finished?
You old fooI!
Do you know how old you are?
Haven't you looked in the mirror?
The war ended fifty years ago.
You haven't got a baby son.
Your wife's probably dead!
Idiot.
What have you got to drink?
Mineral water, coffee?
No coffee, no water.
Water tomorrow morning.
Ok, 265,000 Iire, the price is right, Signor CIaudio wins!
Something to eat? Bread, cheese...
No food, drink, Raki Fernet...
Here, you want eat?
- Take it, very good cheese.
- No.
You don't like Albanian food?
- How much do you want?
- I don't want anything.
1,000 lire, friend.
Friend, 1,000 Iire.
Hey, ltalian, 1,000 lire.
1,000 Iire, ltaIian.
Friend, 1,000 Iire.
1,000 Iire, ltaIian.
Friend, 1,000 Iire.
Bread and cheese.
Eat it, it's fresh.
I'll leave it here, maybe you'll eat it later.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to piss me off again?
What are you crying about now?
Eat this bread.
Look, if you carry on Iike this,
I'm not taking you to Sicily.
I'll leave you here.
How will you get there without me?
How will you get home?
Come on, eat up.
Take it easy.
A big man Iike you crying Iike a baby, you shouId be ashamed.
It's good, eat it up.
See? You were hungry.
If you don't eat you're bound to feel bad.
Everything all right?
The lorry's due, we'Il be in Reggio CaIabria in a few hours.
Then we board the ferry and we're home.
I'm from Sicily too.
Mr. Chairman, what's your son called?
His name's Giovanni.
And how old is he now? Three?
He's almost four.
He's a big boy then.
Think how happy he'll be to see you.
There'lI be another along soon.
Let's wait.
Let me try these.
- Where are you from, ltalian?
- Sicily.
Is Sicily near Bari?
Have I slept long?
Where are we?
Have we passed Naples yet?
Is it true that everyone has water and a telephone at home?
They give us house when we come to Italy?
I see on TV that you have roads where only cars go, no bicycIes, only cars that go very fast.
Motorways!
- You pay for roads?
- Yes, in ltaly you pay everything.
- Also women if you want.
- I know the women you pay.
They alI whores.
Italian whores are beautiful, eh?
Pleased to meet you,
Talarico Michele.
I'm going home to Sicily, where are you going?
Don't you understand dialect?
- Where are you going?
- To the port, to take the ship.
To Naples... you're going to America?
You need money to go to America.
No money, we board ships.
You wish!
You have to have permit to go to America, otherwise they don't
Iet you off the ship.
Before the war, when my parents Ieft they had a permit.
They settled down there.
They went to New York, to Patterson, to Argentina.
They began to work.
They started to earn money and even built a house.
It's a different story over there.
Which team is best,
Juventus or Milan?
Neither of them.
You wrong, Juventus much, much better, they have Schillaci.
- Where you Iive, Torino?
- No.
- Torino is near Bari?
- Yes.
He is good footballer, he go to Juventus.
If Juventus not take me,
I go Milan.
I train every day, also at night, I am never tired.
Football is best job in ltaly.
Make more money than everyone!
Yes, footballers...
If you're lucky you'll get jobs as dish-washers.
There are enough Moroccans,
Poles and black people...
Come to ltaly...
No problem, we do anything.
Better dish-washer in Italy than starve in AIbania.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you feel well?
Are you traveI sick?
Hang on, we're almost there.
Let me sing with my guitar in my hand
Iet me sing a song, softIy, softly.
Let me sing because I'm proud
I'm an ltalian, a true ltalian!
What's this song?
Do you know "Rosamunda"?
Sing it with me.
What's the matter with you?
What is it?
Hey, friend!
Where are you going?
What do you do if lorry goes back?
You want to walk?
Will you leave me alone, please!
I want to come with you.
Wake up, what's up with you?
In ltaly no one die like him.
Young people in ltaly die only in car accident.
But I die an oId man.
Hey, friend, an Italian girI can marry an AIbanian?
Or there's Iaw that say no?
Now that I come to ltaly,
I find girl in Bari.
I want to marry and have many chiIdren.
I never speak AIbanian with my children, only Italian.
So my children forget
I am Albanian.
Wake up.
Eat this bread.
It wiIl do you good.
Hurry, friend, Iorry Ieave!
We bring dead boy with us, we Ieave in first town to bury.
This not hotel anymore, people occupy it.
Here Iive women, chiIdren, men, families, but no one pay.
Evacuees? Have they bombed here too?
No bombs, only shooting.
They take gun and shoot communist party Ieaders.
This is vacant room.
One room, two persons, you pay two persons.
We'Il pay, we'lI pay...
They send us to fight a war promising food and work for everyone.
Instead we're even hungrier than we were before.
Things must change.
When we get home, they'II change.
They'Il change.
You like IittIe girI?
You take her to Italian television.
- Put that down.
- I'm helping these peopIe.
Then they'Il give us some bread and cheese, so we'lI have food for the journey.
Leave it...
How are you?
I left you some miIk, did you find it?
Has your temperature gone down?
Yes, I drank the milk... and you?
You haven't eaten anything.
Go on, you eat something too.
It's expensive here, where wilI we get the money from?
Don't worry.
You mustn't worry about money anymore, get that into your head.
You've got money now.
You're a company chairman, understand?
What's a chairman?
Someone who does a nice comfortable job.
Every so often we bring you papers to sign.
Like last time, name and surname?
You sign them, then your work's finished.
So why did you choose me for the job?
Because the chairman's role is a delicate one.
You can't trust just anybody these days.
We needed an honest person Iike you.
Thank you.
What do I owe you in exchange?
Nothing.
Just keep quiet about it.
Don't go round telling everyone you work for us.
People are envious.
Eat up.
I'm glad I met you. ltaly, ltaly, booth three!
Hello, this is Gino ringing from Albania!
Can you hear me?
Gino calling from Albania!
Can you hear me? Speak louder!
We got cut off!
How can this possibly work?
- You speak here.
- I'll wait.
- Is the phone broken?
- No...
We'lI speak to him.
When he calls...
When it rings we'Il speak with the office and tell them you've agreed to be chairman.
Are you pleased?
But you have to start work right away, know that?
Tomorrow you have to sign your name four times, and you've earned your month's salary.
You can speak to the boss, do you remember Fiore, my partner?
You can say hello to him.
I don't know how to use the phone.
What? There's nothing to it.
Hello, is that ltaly?
Hello, Fiore?
Fiore, thank God...
It's Gino from Albania.
I hope we don't get cut off.
I'll be at Tirana tomorrow, I'll take the old man to the Ministry.
So much has happened here.
Everything's all right, don't worry.
Now then...
Are you phoning too?
Have you got relatives abroad?
Have they got a phone at home?
What's wrong?
Have you received bad news?
Has something happened to your family?
Shut up.
Tell me, maybe I can help.
You're no Ionger chairman.
You've lost your job, that's what's happened.
I knew it.
I thought it over.
How can you earn a living just signing papers?
Thank you anyway, my friend, even if you can't give me a job any more.
I'm out of a job too.
It's over...
..all over.
We're fired, both of us.
We're both young, aren'twe?
We've got arms.
When we get to my village we can eat, have a wash, rest, and we'Il stiII have time to do a day's olive picking.
Well, how much do you want?
Make your mind up, I'm in a hurry.
He's a quiet man, he's never given any bother.
You can put him to work, he's as strong as a man half his age.
He sleeps, occupies bed, eats everyday, but Albania is poor.
Albania poor... here, take this.
Why don't you take to ltaly, take him home?
Why?
Because he's not Italian, he's Albanian, he's got all the papers.
His name's Spiro Tozai.
He fought against communism, he spent fifty years in jaiI.
Now this is a free country you should be grateful to men like him.
We were better off before, with communism.
Here, take it...
Where is the old man then?
Over there.
A little cinema!
I've never seen such a smaIl cinema.
Have you seen how nice this place is?
They've even got a cinema.
You don't even have to pay to watch.
When are we Ieaving here?
Don't you like it here?
There are a Iot of peopIe here.
Many families, children...
All nice people.
The place is big.
And the food's not bad, is it?
The cheese was tasty.
So... why not stay here for a while?
That way you can have a rest.
You've got a bed, a room of your own, meals every day.
What more could you want?
You're better off here than at home.
But I have a home.
I can't take you home.
There are too many problems now.
But I've spoken to the owner here, he's a kind man.
He'lI take you to Sicily.
What will you do?
Don't worry, I'lI keep in touch.
I'll come and see you in Sicily.
Have I done anything wrong?
Why have you lost heart now we're almost there?
We should go to Sicily together.
I won't Iet you go aIone, now that you need help.
I don't need anyone, Mr. Chairman.
I'm ltalian, I'm staying in the hotel! Let me through!
I don't understand, Iet go of me!
Let go of me, I'm ltaIian!
Let go of me!
You've got the wrong man, it's nothing to do with me.
What have I done?
Open this door, I'm Italian!
I'm ltaIian, don't you understand!
Is this what you call democracy?
Is this what it means to you?
You're stilI communists!
You've not changed at alI!
Aren't you drinking it?
Don't you Iike Turkish coffee?
I don't Iike it either,
I like ltaIian coffee, espresso.
My father Ioved Italy.
He studied art at Florence in Vittorio Emanuele's time.
You know that church...
Santa Maria Novella?
He told me it's beautiful, is it?
Yes... where are my bags?
I gave my cIothes away.
This Albanian prison is a nasty place.
Your bags have been sequestered.
What do you want from me?
Name, surname and place of birth.
Cudrali Luigi, Agrigento,
January 30th, 1963.
Have you anything to do with this company called Alba Calzature?
I work for them.
I work with them.
Just answer yes or no, please.
Yes.
Were you there when this was signed at the Ministry?
Yes.
Everything's in order, isn't it? It was alI legaI.
Mr. Croce was there too, you can ask him...
No, not Mr. Croce, Mr. Kruja!
This man is now in worse prison that this.
What have I done?
What am I accused of?
You are accused of corruption of this official.
In communist time, you would be shot.
Corruption, shooting...
What do you mean?
You're still not used to western methods.
That's how things work in ltaly, to speed up bureaucracy.
We help the cases move quicker.
It makes it more efficient.
It's better.
We're businessmen.
The Albanian economy is at a crisis.
The people are starving so we risk our money, we invest our own money.
Albanian economy is dead, but in civilized country dead are not left to dog in street.
Let me calI the Embassy.
Call them.
Call them.
There are only Albanians in Italian Embassy.
Refugees who have occupied alI embassy.
They are crazy.
They all want go ltaly with ship.
What do I have to do?
You must sign this confession and I'Il reIease you tilI trial.
UntiI trial?
What wilI happen at the triaI?
I interested in sending to prison corrupt officiaI.
You leave Albania soon as possible.
Thank you.
Where do I go without a passport?
But in Albania no one has documents.
Son.
Husband.
Bread.
Song.
Love.
Cold.
GirI.
Flower.
Good.
Hand.
Apple.
Shoe.
Ship.
Sea.
Come here.
Sit down.
I'm so happy you're on board too.
We can travel together.
How are you?
We've both been very unlucky, but we have to keep heart.
Have you seen alI these people?
I didn't think they'd all get on.
But America's a big place!
Some have brought their families but Giovanni is too young it would be too much for him.
Rosa too is delicate she always has a fever.
Paisa', can you speak American?
I can hardly speak ltalian.
Do you think we'lI find a job anyway?
I'm tired.
But I want to be awake when we reach New York.
It was on my fourth birthday...
When my aunt was reading sei shonagon...
That I saw my father and his publisher together...
For the first time.
Though I'm certain that any clear understanding of what I had witnessed...
Would have to wait until I was much older.
On my sixth birthday...
At the matsuo tiasha shrine in kyoto,
Encouraged by my aunt,
I vowed I would keep a diary.
A pillow book of my own.
I would fill it with all manner of observations,
Just like sei shonagon.
Perhaps one day, like her,
I could fill it with accounts of all my lovers.
On the same day as I started to keep my own pillow book,
I met my future husband for the first time.
I was six. He was ten.
We did not exchange a word.
He had been handpicked by my father's publisher.
Like sei shonagon, my sense of smell was very strong.
I enjoyed the smell of paper of all kinds.
It reminded me of the scent of skin.
My mother had taught me mandarin.
When my father painted a japanese greeting...
On my face on my birthday,
She played her favorite chinese record.
It had been popular when my parents had met in shanghai.
In remembrance of my father and in memory of sei shonagon,
I was determined to take lovers who would remind me...
Of the pleasures of calligraphy.
I could not be sure which was more important...
An indifferent calligrapher who was a good lover...
Or an excellent lover who was a poor calligrapher.
I became a wife.
I married.
I acquired a husband.
Whichever way you say it,
It was bound to end badly.
I had a ceremonial wedding in style.
Separated from my parents and my aunt,
I confided in my own pillow book more and more frequently.
Like the pillow book of sei shonagon, it was full of lists.
Unlike sei shonagon, all the lists were negative.
That was the first fire.
There was to be a second.
Both fires marked a big change in my life.
When I first arrived in hong kong, I hid.
I lived in kowloon city in the cheapest rooming houses I could find.
I did not want to be found by my parents...
Or by my husband.
I tried hard to improve the chinese my mother had taught me.
In the meantime,
I was determined...
To keep alive my father's tradition.
I learned to type on my 21st birthday,
I tried to give myself my father's blessing.
I found work in the offices of a japanese designer.
And I was determined to speak english with an american accent.
I was planning to go to california.
Twenty meter of pale green organdy, pattern 14.
A meter of type-b tulle.
The small net size.
The type-b tulle with the small net size.
We went to kyoto, back to japan,
To work in the matuso tiasha shrine,
Which sei shonagon had visited regularly.
I couldn't give up such an opportunity.
I was also a little homesick.
We didn't finish walking the catwalk until midnight...
When all the audience had gone.
Sei shonagon had watched the moon rise in that garden...
A thousand years ago.
I could have walked up and down that path all night long.
You are not in a position to preach clean living.
Oh, yes, I am.
And in blood red.
You could join us.
I'm too beautiful...
And too rich.
- What's wealth got to do with it?
- A great deal, I'd think.
I design material.
You can wear it.
Frighten the buyers.
Then I'd soon cease to be wealthy.
You wouldn't need to be paid.
You would do it for free.
Oh, yeah?
What else would you do for free?
I've been waiting to waste my talent on your body...
For a little reward.
My search for the ideal lover-calligrapher continued.
But it was becoming less and less likely that I would find him.
If they were old, they were invariably in no position...
To take advantage of what I had to offer.
And if they were young, they were often easily distracted.
It's them!
Don't look! Don't look.
What are you doing here?
Are you responsible for this?
You shrimp!
What do you think you're doing?
Shut up!
They were children playing a game.
They used hoki, the japanese photographer from tokyo,
As a pawn to find me.
I want those photos.
I had once kissed him on the cheek in a moment of happiness.
- You're a creep.
- I'm sorry.
I have watched you, followed you everywhere.
It's only too obvious.
And I could help you.
You haven't done too well so far.
You are very beautiful.
I employed a calligrapher...
With an obsession for mathematics.
While his wife sang and waited in the kitchen,
This account clerk filled my back with additions,
My front with subtractions.
I contacted a magazine designer...
Who insisted that I came back to his apartment in the new territories,
Where he could show me off to his parents who wanted grandchildren.
- Write "dear nagiko."
- What?
- I took risks.
- Where?
- Here.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- Who knows what casual meeting would produce a surprise.
Nagiko?
Some of the great japanese calligraphers...
Were very modest and unassuming men.
Humble clerks by day, daring poets by night.
Good. Now write something else here.
With great trepidation,
I sought to move away from what I knew best.
After all, there were other great calligraphic traditions.
What have you written?
That's for you to find out.
How am I going to do that?
You know, some cultures permit no images.
Perhaps some cultures ought to permit no visible text.
I need writing.
Don't ask me why.
Just take out your pen and,
Please, write your name on my arm.
Go on.
I met an english translator at the cafe typo.
He said he spoke four languages, including yiddish.
I'll give you another chance.
Write on my back.
Well, what shall I write?
Write...
"we met for the first time at the cafe typo."
Write in three languages...
Japanese, french and english.
Waitress!
Are we going to do more writing?
Perhaps.
You smell strange.
Do you use perfume?
And your fingers.
What's wrong with my fingers?
I'll give you another chance.
The last one.
Write on my breasts.
A little inappropriate.
I'll decide what's inappropriate.
Write in yiddish.
What's yiddish for "breasts"?
If you're a writer, surely you'd write on anything?
This is not going to work.
You're not a writer.
This is not writing;
It's scribbling.
Distasteful scribbling.
Get out.
You're not a writer;
You're a scribbler.
I've watched you with your little typewriter go click, click, clack.
Get out. Go!
You could show me.
- Go on.
- No. I can't.
How can I get pleasure writing on you?
You have to write on me.
Go on.
Use my body like the pages of a book.
Of your book.
Not a special writing instrument at all.
I began very tentatively,
Thinking of sei shonagon's lists of anatomical comparisons.
The thoughts were often hers,
But the words were entirely mine.
For my first experiment in using flesh as paper,
I made a deal with an englishman who was entirely ignorant of oriental languages.
Hoki, this is where you can prove you have my interests at heart.
Come here quickly.
Off you go.
Beautiful photographs.
And you don't get paid because you owe me.
This is where I begin to do the writing.
I'm now going to be the pen, not just the paper.
I could help you.
I think not.
Why not? What's wrong with me?
Because you are from kyoto, and you're young.
And your handwriting is illegible.
Besides, your skin does not make a good paper.
Watch.
You see? In my diary,
I called you "the blotter."
Hoki the blotter.
I could help you.
I think not.
Why not?
You're none too smart with compliments.
Let me try.
Let me try.
Hoki set off at dawn for a foreign language bookshop...
In kowloon city in a street full of restaurants.
He finally gave the packet to some doorman.
"We feel that we are unable to consider...
"publication of this material.
It's not worth the paper it's written on."
So they're not satisfied with the quality of the paper.
Perhaps it's not japanese enough.
Try writing on me.
Seduce him.
I met jerome in the cafe typo...
And asked him for the services of a translator.
He gave me a choice of six languages.
They had increased by two.
I talked to him and I flattered him,
And I admired all the books he had yet to write.
You have to sign here.
Our first transaction was strictly financial.
He wanted to pay the bill but had no money.
He offered to write a check but had no checkbook.
I volunteered the palm of my hand.
If I could not seduce the publisher,
Then perhaps I could seduce the publisher's lover.
His writing, in so many languages,
Made me a signpost pointing east, west, north and south.
I had shoes in german, stockings in french,
Gloves in hebrew, a hat with a veil in italian.
He only kept me naked where I was most accustomed to wear clothes.
Shut up. Go away. Go away.
I would like to honor my father by becoming a writer.
I could help.
I could learn new languages...
To make you understood...
All over the world.
When god made his first human being...
He painted in the eyes.
And lips.
And the sex.
And when god approved of his creation...
He was obliged to sign his name.
There are so many publishers in the world.
Why worry about this one?
I have my reasons.
I suspect it's because he rejected you so swiftly,
And few people, if any, have ever done that.
Perhaps.
But... If you're so determined to be published by him,
The publisher who rejects you and who loves me...
Then I have a plan.
I could be your messenger.
You could write on me.
And with your permission and, of course, your blessing, I could...
Pay your publishing friend a visit?
A sacrifice?
But not without pleasure for you?
Perhaps.
You could be jealous?
Vtamo?
It's worked. He won't let me go.
Wait for me.
He's thinking of an edition of 3,000...
If there are more, and there will be more, won't there?
I'll see you this evening.
Wait for me here.
Hey, you are enjoying it too much.
But with your permission. And only according to the quality of the writing.
If you don't hurry it along, I'll be looking for someone else.
You dare.
He's making me wait.
Buy some new paper.
Don't get so upset.
You could use me.
Give me two more of these and some more of this and some stuff for him.
You could have babies.
- They're not bad-looking ladies.
- I need some skin, two meters and a half.
- Sorry?
- Back and front.
I could give you three and a half.
True, but the quality of the paper would not attract my fastidious publisher.
Jerome! Jerome.
Jerome! Jerome.
Jerome!
Jerome!
Jerome!
Jerome!
I need you both. Come with me?
I really do.
It's like wild kingdom.
All right, you're gonna like this one.
This one's funny.
Okay. There are these two lesbians, all right?
And one says to the other...
Keep going. Keep going.
It felt good.
It felt good, I swear to god.
You know something? If you had a pair of tits...
Hey, you know something? They got a song about you in america.
You know what it's called?
It's called "the hokeypokey."
You get it? "The hokeypokey."
Ready? You put your right foot in you put your right foot out your put your right foot in and you shake it all about you do the hokeypokey.
You turn your...
Hello. Sorry.
Americans always say they have nothing to hide.
I can see that's true.
Look what I got here?
It is a menu.
It's a menu to my very own restaurant.
So you come on in.
No, get off! Come on in. And you've known me a long time. I'll let you in free.
Moo goo gai pan and all that stuff.
You wanna come in?
How 'bout a little kiss? How 'bout you kiss me in the hay? How does that sound?
Love me a long time, baby, love me a long... nagiko? C'est moi.
C'est jerome.
Nagiko?
Nagiko!
Nagiko...
Nagiko! Nagiko!
I know you're there! Let me in!
Don't play games!
I know you're there!
Nagiko!
I met your friend.
I met your fat friend.
He was nice? Was he nice?
He was covered in my paint!
My paint for my body!
Nagiko! Nagiko!
Nagiko! Nagiko!
Oh, my god! What have I done?
What have I done?
I'll make it... make it up!
Please let me in!
I love you, nagiko.
I love you. Talk to me.
Nagiko!
Please!
I won't play games.
Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in!
Hoki, why won't she talk to me?
- Nagiko, why won't she talk to me?
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Have you seen her?
When did you last see her?
Oi.
Whiskey.
Whiskey.
She comes here, you know, to pick up her clients.
She almost lives here.
The waiters are all pimps.
She makes sure they are very smooth-skinned.
You know? Between the legs?
Her maid usually washes them...
With lemon juice to make their skin soft...
And smooth.
But you could scare her.
You are a writer,
Like in romeo and juliet.
Shakespeare?
Jerome? Jerome? Jerome?
Jerome? Jerome? I'm sorry.
We can start again from where we left off.
I was angry. You deceived me...
With a man I detest, with a man who blackmailed my father.
But... We can revenge him.
We need to work.
Jerome.
Jerome?
Jerome! Jerome! Jerome!
Jerome!
Jerome always wanted to be foreign,
Though not necessarily oriental.
English wasn't enough for him.
He'd never have made a writer.
He didn't have enough imagination.
Jerome was dyslexic until he was 12,
Before it became fashionable.
And he broke every pair of glasses I gave him.
He hated wearing glasses.
He was very good at breaking things,
Especially relationships, just like his father.
His father was a catholic convert, always experimenting with faith.
We called our first son paul and our second jerome...
After his father's confessor, who was a jesuit in singapore.
Jerome never liked me.
He preferred my sister,
A little fool who was excited by modern literature.
All swear words and scatology, before it became fashionable.
I hear you're fashionable.
I suppose that's what excited jerome.
We burned an effigy of jerome's car.
We didn't burn his books.
They were too damp.
I burned my books...
And my clothes and shoes...
And the photographs and diaries.
It was the second major fire in my life.
The first fire had taken me out of japan.
The second took me back.
Hoki wrote to me.
Even after jerome's death, he was still very, very jealous.
He wrote to tell me about the publisher's act of sacrilege.
I had promised jerome 13 books.
I could not now write them on jerome's body.
I found substitutes in japan.
I would write the books for the publisher as a bargain...
For the return of the pillow book he had made of jerome's body.
Now you've been signed by me,
You can go and do my business.
Excuse me. Can I see the manager, please?
Let's take another photograph.
Excuse me. Give it to the manager and tell him we are here.
This is the writing of Nagiko Yujikino,
And I know you to have blackmailed,
Violated and humiliated my father.
I suspect you also of ruining my husband.
You have now committed the greatest crime.
You have desecrated the body of my lover.
You and I now know...
That you have lived long enough.
Today, I am 28 years old.
And on my 28th birthday
I have experiences enough...
To write my own pillow book.
Think of that.
The pillow book of Nagiko Kiyohara.
I can now make my own list of things...
That make the heart beat faster.
THE INHERITORS
One time the farmer was drunk.
He said:
Today is a joyous day, the servants are to sing me songs.
And then he started crying... and afterwards he gave each of us a whole gulden.
Even though he was a mean and stingy man.
That was the only really strange thing... that I ever experienced here, on the farm, and I had already been there a couple of months.
Until the night... the strange woman came and sat on Lukas' bed.
I think...
I knew right then... that there was something odd about that, and that it was just the first of more odd things to come...
Sometimes it's like that:
You can tell it's not about to stop... and that even more is about to happen.
Likewise, when someone dies, a lot of times in the end there's another death.
You are aware... that you're committing a terrible sin... if you conceal anything, right, Reverend?
Didn't see or hear anything?
Who's the foreman here?
Was there a fight, yesterday?
A visitor perhaps?
We...
- What?
Speak up!
We were in the cowshed until late, then we went to bed.
Without any supper because the farmer said we did a bad job.
It's as if he was looking for something, the murderer...
"Last will and testament.
To be read aloud in front of everyone when I'm dead."
Keep working until all is settled, is that clear, foreman?
Nobody spoke a word that day.
But that's the way it was anyway.
If you said more than five words, they said... you were a good-for-nothing blabber mouth.
I never got used to that.
That's why I kept going back to the city.
With the police... keep your mouth shut unless you're asked.
Don't take everything that bastard dishes out.
Sometimes... when I was in the cowshed,
I would start talking to a cow.
I know it's dumb.
But it just shows... that for me it was really a problem... that nobody talked to anybody.
Let me through.
Jesus Christ!
Somebody stumbled across Rosalind.
She was just sitting there.
That her name was Rosalind and that she was indeed involved... only old Nane knew any of this at the time, but, of course, she didn't say a word.
Were you always a peasant?
I've done other work occasionally.
You could say
I was born here on the farm.
Old Nane found me, out back, by the cowshed door.
What's it like somewhere else, in the city?
A poor wretch... has a hard life everywhere.
That's why... if I don't get work,
I'm going to America.
You can get land there real easy.
You want to come too?
To America?
That's a long way.
We'll have to get an early morning start!
Listen:
That's how they say it in America.
What does that mean?
Severin!
Tell me!
Not that he was dumb, but I don't think...
Lukas ever really thought about anything in his life.
He simply did things.
That's why he could be so happy-go-lucky all the time.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
And he made love to the peasant girls, especially to Emmy, but actually, he chased after all the girls in the village.
"If it gets hard on me, there's got to be a reason for it," he would say.
Somebody just died and you want to...
A dead man can't give orders anymore.
Just because he's dead doesn't mean we have to go hungry.
I say when we eat now.
Now.
Foreman, I...
No talking when we're eating.
Lukas, Severin!
Afterwards, you fix the gate.
Emmy, you wash my clothes!
Good riddance to him.
At least say who you are!
But she didn't say anything, not a word, and it made the policeman furious.
Because he'd never had a mysterious murder before.
The girl in the front, she likes me, I think.
Look, Reverend, the farm is worth 40,000 maximum!
We'll give the church 30,000 and you can have the Steingrund orchard.
The farmers had already divvied up the inheritance... because they figured, without a descendant... it would all go to the church.
Hey, foundling!
Hurry up!
Silence!
I want silence!
"Now that I'm dead... and our Lord has spared me children and relatives,
I hereby bequeath to the... following persons that which they deserve:
Firstly, the reverend, for he is as good a Christian... as good a Christian as my ass is divine:
A wagonload of cow dung..."
"Is what he inherits" should be added.
"Secondly, farmer Danninger, a kick in the ass for..."
I'm only reading what it says,
"...for nobody would dare kill him, even if it was my dying wish.
Thirdly, foreman, for he is a mean bastard who can't find a woman,
Lukas, for he is a smart ass and a lazybones,
Severin, the outsider who talks to the cows, old Nane, for her breath is as malodorous as a pile of manure,
Gertrude, the scolding harpy... and the stable boy who's not quite right upstairs,
Sepp whose head is full of straw,
Lisbeth and Liesl not much brighter,
...and Emmy who gave everyone a piece but me..."
Silence!
"They get the farm, the land, the livestock and everything in the house... to manage jointly, and I hope they beat each other to death... when they fight over it."
Silence! Silence, for heaven's sake!
"Fourthly, my neighbors, noble sirs, you can all kiss my ass.
And now I'm going to hell, good-day and amen."
The farm belongs to us now!
Foreman,
Come here!
A crazy old bastard, wasn't he...
Yeah...
- C'mon,
Have some schnapps with me... and let's have a little talk.
And everyone thought it would be annulled, on account of the likes of that had never happened before, and wouldn't now either.
That's how people think in the country.
WHO KNOWS
THIS WOMAN?
And Emmy went and got her bastard son, he lived with foster parents... because a peasant girl can't have a child... that will keep her from doing her work.
Danninger will pay 10,000 schillings, that's 1,000 in cash for each of us, and he promises work on his farm to able bodies.
That's a good deal and I already shook on it.
Tomorrow we go and sign.
If Danninger says 10, he'll pay 20, too,
'cause it's worth 30,000.
It's settled, I said.
Ten thousand is a good price,
Danninger said so.
The mother of a bastard doesn't know any better.
The farmer's dead, but the peasants can keep working.
I'm buying a walking stick with a silver knob, and a hat, round and tall...
A top hat?
Nane! What are you buying with your money?
Emmy, did you hear?
I'm buying a top hat!
I never had anything, so I don't need anything now.
Or maybe I do, an umbrella, so I don't get wet when it rains.
We have to be careful now... and we can't make any mistakes.
Settled, settled, settled... and a house and a woman... for the peasant...
No, enough.
Should I buy you something with my money, too?
Fine silk stockings... or...
I'm not selling.
How come?
A life of working for someone else, letting men hump you, then just dying somewhere:
It doesn't make sense!
Don't you understand?!
Lukas! We can be farmers, now!
But... a peasant can't be...
What?
You can work for someone else, but not for yourself?
Yeah, but...
Afraid to try?
Wait!
I don't want to sell.
No talking I said.
But we...
Listen foreman, we're all hard workers.
Why shouldn't we work for oursel...
We're selling to Danninger, and that's that.
Why work a lifetime for someone else, someone who doesn't pay enough?
Then you get chased off like a dog... when you're old and can't work anymore!
Don't you understand?
The farm belongs to us now!
We don't have to sell!
Didn't you hear what I said,
Danninger gets it, it's already settled.
Lukas is right.
When a peasant tries to become a farmer... disaster becomes of it!
- Says the farmer.
Kiss my ass.
- Look, foreman...
I'm the farmer, and I own one tenth of every animal and every pasture.
It's already settled!
I'm the farmer and I own one tenth of every animal and every pasture.
It's settled!
Stop it!
Tell them who's boss!
Stop it!!
It's a sin for us to want to be farmers.
I'm staying with my foundling.
I have to.
It will end in disaster.
Foreman!
Get off of our farm!
A curse on you, foundling!
And the rest of you, a curse on you, too!
No one can beat me up anymore, right?
From now on, nobody can beat me up?!
What...
It's mine now!
What...
I don't think I really understood until now... that I'm a real farmer who owns something!
And if anyone in the whole world, tries to tell me what to do,
I'll just say:
Yeah, but...
From now on this is my house!
My house!
Our house.
And we thought... no one could ever take that away from us.
Idiot!
I did everything, but... things worked out differently.
He wants to be a farmer, the foundling and his womenfolk...
They'll probably have to sell anyway... since they don't have 3,000 schillings to pay out our shares.
Pay...
Listen you idiot, listen real good.
Naturally they won't be able to pay.
You understand?
What if we choose to claim it...
Can you do it with no one giving orders?
Yes, we'll manage.
We need your signatures in the land record.
Come down to the local recording office.
All 7?
- I guess you're... one-seventh farmers.
Hey, foundling, how you going to sign your name?
What, I...
- Thumbprint?
You do know which one's the thumb?
Index finger... middle finger...
But I know how to...
He knows how all right, with four women...
And you, foreman? Forgotten how?
Don't get cocky, woman.
It takes more than sleeping around or not having a home to be a farmer.
What's so special about a farmer?
A farmer is a farmer, that's all.
Just like women aren't men and jackasses aren't horses.
He who goes against the will of God... shall meet with disaster.
And God told you what he wants,
Danninger?
God wants things the way they are and always have been.
Maybe God is getting a little bored just now...
Let's forgive and forget.
Beware lest you sin.
Whore.
The farmers got angry... and they didn't forgive us, and they probably thought to themselves:
We'll get them back for that, the foundling and that shameless hussy.
Forgive me God!
Index finger.
You are like a tower,
No foe has ever taken,
No storm can make me cower,
Beside you I'm unshaken.
In heaven I am safe,
Forever near my King,
Who shelters this poor waif,
Beneath His beating wing.
A farmer from Viechtwang stated for record that... the doctor had told Rosalind... she would die soon on account of her heart.
Then she left without saying goodbye, and that same night she killed Hillinger.
Don't be so chicken...
Yeah, all right...
What a mess!
It was the murderess.
So many things!
A trousseau...
Like what elegant ladies with hats have.
Nane!
We're going into his room!
Come on!
I'm not going in there, never again, not in there.
Why, did he...
I never had anything... of my own, my whole life long.
Except for when I found the boy.
Lukas?
At first...
Hillinger didn't want to let me keep him.
I had to pay for it.
Twice a week he made me go up to his room.
Then I started eating garlic so he'd get disgusted.
Now Hillinger is dead and the boy is the farmer.
Liesl! Come here now!
It's so soft...
This is a nice room!
I wouldn't mind... and Severin, too, if he wants...
Nobody's sleeping in here ever again.
Today is Sunday.
The day of rest for a farmer, all he does is smoke his pipe and drink coffee.
Make your own coffee.
I'm a farmer myself.
Now what?
Nothing. This is free time.
Nane, what are you doing...?
Leave it!
You're not allowed to work!
It's free time now.
Oh, shush.
Lisbeth?
You think we'll always have to do free time?
I don't know.
Maybe next week we can go for a walk instead.
I found it upstairs in Hillinger's room, it's a...
Gramophone.
- It's a Gramophone!
What's he singing?
- American.
When the old elephant died, the circus people went to the city for a new one.
And then evening came... and they just happened to ask us... if they could spend the night.
We never even thought... that it was an unusually unusual thing:
For example, if you have a dream, you don't think anything of it... when an elephant appears.
And Lisbeth got herself pregnant... because she figured she'd never get herself another elephant keeper.
But Lisbeth really was foolish.
My name is Rosalind.
I was one of Hillinger's peasants.
That was twenty years ago.
And soon it had made the rounds, and everyone remembered... what happened back then.
Rosalind was the most beautiful girl in the whole valley.
Everyone was after her, and especially Hillinger.
Nobody was good enough for her.
She was proud and she used to laugh... and not let anyone have her.
Then one night,
Hillinger took her by force.
I heard her screaming... and I plugged my ears... because she was my dearest friend and there was nothing I could do.
The next day she went to the police and reported him.
Herr Hillinger, Franz, address 362 Kirchham, forced me to have intercourse with him and used violence...
Said she didn't want it... and that the farmer was rough with her...
Imagine: Just like that!
A peasant girl reporting the farmer!
Before it was brought before court,
Hillinger hid a brooch in Rosalind's trunk... and said... that she had stolen it.
She did steal it, the whore.
Otherwise she wouldn't have run away.
She was gone for half a year, or maybe more.
She fled in the face of injustice.
Then they finally caught her.
And put her in prison.
It didn't take a long trial after that!
It was a grave injustice.
Fifteen years... at Garsten Prison, sentence effective immediately.
An injustice.
A grave injustice.
And when the doctor said
I was going to die,
I went and killed him.
She killed him and that was just.
And she took the brooch... because she'd paid dearly for it back then.
Now they're going to hang her, but at least it won't be for nothing, this time.
What old Nane told us then still wasn't the whole truth, and Rosalind told even less.
There was unrest in the valley back then:
When the farmers testified for Hillinger, the peasants were angry, they got uppity.
They're getting uppity again.
Those one-seventh farmers are trouble.
A peasant can't be a farmer.
Something has to be done.
Something shall be done...
"A" is for apple.
"B" is for... dang, how did "B" go again?
Breasts!
Why didn't you go to school?
No, without the dots...
The farmer didn't let me go too much.
Because of work and all.
I'm dumb, aren't I?
You're dumb... that you were born poor.
Will you make me smart?
Now that I am a farmer: Why do I have to go to market myself and on foot?
Stop talking nonsense.
In the name of... blah, blah... too long...
I hereby decree:
The court-appointed commission has assessed... the Hillinger farmstead, 362 Kirchham, including land and property, all livestock and items therein to be worth...
40,000 schillings...
What?! Forty thousand?
The value of one inheritance share is 4,000 schillings...
Payable in four months time,
September 22.
Failure shall result in execution sale.
Period.
I know who's behind this...
You lousy swindlers!
They looked at us as if...
But we sold more.
Have you counted it?
And it all belongs to us alone?
We won't throw it into Hillinger's grave for him.
Are you crazy?
We've got to save every coin, and you...
But I'm a farmer now... and... this is my money now!
Is not!
- Is so!
Is not!
- Is so!
Don't you ever do that again!
Do you understand! Never!
Is it right for them...
It's all just as much Lisbeth's as it is yours.
Do you think I'm doing all this to have a young farmer instead of an old one?
But someone has to...
What?
Give orders?
And who says that someone is you?
I talked it over with Severin, and...
And you voted on it, the two of you?!
Do you want to vote on who's boss? Do you?
Florian, come here.
Lisbeth! Liesl!
Forgive me.
And now put the stupid hat away.
She... cried... with desire.
She... took... his... gigantic... pe... nis.
What was that again?
Penis. That's what you've got for a brain.
I'm educating myself.
Reading... geography, that kind of thing...
We have to pay 12,000 in four months' time.
We found 5,460 in Hillinger's things, we girls have 837 all together.
How much do you have?
But I wanted to...
- And you?
That makes...
We need another 5,500.
More or less.
We're not selling any land.
And if we sell a few cows...
Five cows, that's all we can spare.
That makes... if we bargain well,
That still leaves 3,500.
We'll never come up with that.
- Just have to work hard.
The work was always hard, but during those months we all worked twice as hard, even though that wasn't actually possible.
During the day, we men went to Deutenham... and worked in the foundry.
And the women did the field chores alone.
Lukas and I earned fifteen schillings between the two of us... because we were the hardest workers there.
What were you telling them?
What it's like to be a one-seventh farmer.
It's not easy.
It's funny: Used to be nobody would listen to me when I talked.
You didn't have anything to say before.
Lisbeth! You come here right now when I say so!
And then in the evening there was all the work... around the farmyard.
Please, please, please come here right now!
"C" is for clover, cow, ca-ca.
He said I could join the circus if I wanted...
I never said...
- Oh, stop it...
I never said anyone...
Stop it...
Why can't you do what I want, just once?!
Because I'd rather do what I want!
But then again:
There were plenty of fights, that's something one can't forget.
I want more soup.
And the stable boy spoke, where everyone had always thought he was mute or... an idiot.
I don't know, no one was there anymore when we found the cow lying there dead.
But it can only be that Danninger over there.
No one ever arrests that Danninger.
None of you has the guts.
A lot of mean things happened.
Once two grown men beat up the stable boy.
That's what kind of scoundrels they were.
Meanwhile, Emmy rearranged the cows in the shed... put them the way they liked one another, as opposed to the way they used to be, in alphabetical order.
The cows started producing more milk after that.
That was interesting, actually.
And other good things happened, too:
Sometimes the peasants from other farms came over and helped.
For no reason.
And they did it secretly because the farmers didn't want them to.
It's raining, it's pouring...
I hope it does the harvest good.
Don't, leave me alone...
What's wrong?
I don't want to. Not now.
You never want to anymore.
Don't you like me anymore?
Are you something better now?
Yes, I'm something better.
Before nothing mattered...
I don't want to.
Either you like someone, or you don't.
What's wrong?
Y'know, as a peasant you were told what to do, work, eat, sleep.
But now everything is so complicated.
Maybe it's that... before, we had nothing, and nothing to lose either.
And besides, nobody likes me anymore...
Nobody wants you bossing them around is all.
And what if I'm right!
Today with the yoke and the oxen...
You still don't have the right to call Liesl a "toad girl."
Scoot over!
If nobody likes me anymore,
I can't handle that.
I like all of you.
And especially Emmy.
This is Frau Hedwig Grabner from the Brandner Farm.
She went up to her farmer... and asked for the money he owed her.
Louis and Sophie.
They got married, even though Farmer Obermeier refused to let them.
When Farmer Pucher wouldn't pay
Herta and Sigrid higher wages, they left to go work in the factory.
So the farmers decided... that the one-seventh farmers were responsible for the unrest, and that all this had to stop.
And the reverend said... that we were living in sin and corruption.
Wonder where he got that idea!
So we just stopped going to church, except for old Nane because she was afraid of going to hell.
And one time it snowed, even though it wasn't even October.
Everyone thought:
That's a sign from the Almighty.
I can guess who's...
Look what I found in my things.
You found it?
I don't know either...
It's so pretty...
The brooch...
THE brooch?
The one Rosalind...?
- The murderess' brooch...
But why...?
- That night,
I saw Rosalind sitting on your bed...
What?!
...and she was singing a lullaby, like you sing to your children...
It's gold.
If we sell it, maybe we can keep the cows.
And that's how we were able to pay with one week to spare.
And we were all mighty proud.
Seven? Can't do that.
What if we just write one name and then an "et" dot "al" dot?
"And others"?
No, attach a piece of paper with enough room on it.
Filgrater, Emilie.
Go ahead and write it!
Candlemas, Lukas.
- Slow down.
Candlemas?
What?
You know, they...!
- That's when they found you?!
That's fine; sounds better than Ascension.
Do women have to be silly even at the recording office?!
Foreman and the other two got their money, and we had a photograph taken.
You'll see, a one-seventh farmer will never find a husband.
You going to buy another round, now that you're rich?
A beer! This instant!
Here you go, a beer!
This instant!
And when's the execution?
Next week they're transferring her to Salzburg... after that sometime.
Strange woman, that one.
At the trial she said,
"Marital status: Single, one child," and then,
"a big and handsome one, a farmer."
What's that supposed to mean?
That's all she said.
Except: "Guilty? Yes."
Foundling,
Come over here!
Why are you dancing with your peasants?
I thought you were the farmer!?
All of us are the farmer now.
You... and Severin... and the womenfolk... and the pigs, too?
And who's the boss? When you work, and just in general?
What the majority decides, we do...
- You vote?!
You have to let the womenfolk tell you what to do...
You do a lot of heavy pumping every night!
And your womenfolk, do they vote to see... who you get to screw first?
He who has a big mouth often has a small cock, right, foreman?!
Danninger, we have so much fun and still reap a bigger harvest than you... does your wife have this much fun when she's... working?
She's a woman... and a farmer.
Murder child...
C'mon let's go.
Emmy... did you really mean what you said earlier?
I said what I said.
I mean when you said... that a man with a big mouth has a little cock, and because I...
Oh Jesus... what an idiot!
Should we...
I mean...
No peasant attacks me, not me.
They're finished.
Finished.
It was a good year.
It was a hot summer with plenty of rain for good soil and a plentiful harvest.
And I thought a lot about Rosalind, the murderess... and about Emmy and Lukas.
And it got me a little scared... because there was so much fate involved... in such a short time period.
What are you going to do without your whores?
Murder child?
Murder child...
If you can't defend your farm, you're no farmer at all!
No one's ever beating me up again!
No one's ever beating me again.
But I just wanted...
Why "murder child"?
Come, boy, come.
We have to go.
It was self-defense.
Severin said if it's self-defense, they don't punish you...
Come boy, it's bedtime.
Listen, if all of you testify in court that it was self-defense...
Severin will go to the police and everything will be okay...
This cave... have you been here before?
I didn't even know...
Rosalind was the most beautiful of them all, always gay... and kind to everyone.
- What? Rosalind?
They were mad over her, everyone in the village, but she didn't want to.
And then Hillinger took her by force.
Here? But I thought...
And Rosalind... got a big belly after that.
But nobody knew.
A child? From Hillinger?
She hid up here for seven months... and then she gave birth.
And not until then did she let herself be put in prison, even though it was unjust.
When did it happen?
It was cold, the coldest winter... and it was a boy...
How many years ago?
It happened on Candlemas.
But then... Rosalind is my... and Hillinger is my...
Sleep now.
Early the next morning...
Lisbeth and Liesl went away, forever.
Much later I heard... that Lisbeth named her child "Lukas"... because she couldn't remember the elephant keeper's name, but that might have just been a rumor.
All right, back to the field.
But it's a fact that... in the months to follow so many peasant girls named their sons "Lukas"... that not even Lukas could have sired them all...
Get off my property!
Danninger put out a 200 gulden reward... for anyone who could catch Lukas.
Soon they were coming from all over, day-laborers and rogues...
'cause an honest peasant doesn't do that kind of thing:
Hunt a man.
Jesus, what an idiot.
They'll slaughter him like a pig if they catch him.
Everything will be okay.
Nobody but us testified that it was in self-defense... was what they told us, and they said that a murderer must be punished.
"F" is for free time, flirting... these fucking flies.
Take a walk, you two!
Why do you need another farm?
You own everything up here... and we...
- Go on, get out of here.
Is it money you want so you'll let us be...
Why come to me, Filgrater, Emilie?
If your... goes around beating people to death?
Look... Danninger, we don't want any handouts from anyone, we just want what's rightfully ours.
And we all worked very hard this year, and we had a good harvest, and everything is much better than when the farmer was still...
All I ask of you is that you spare Lukas his life...
You are a whore, I knew it all along.
She's a whore with no morals.
Unfortunately not.
I'd find it easier if she was...
They don't give a damn what Lukas did.
They just want everyone to see that people like us end miserably.
They'd love to crush him.
And our farm...
I'm not kidding.
What happened at Danninger's?
What did he do?
Nothing.
Everything's okay, okay, okay. I'm fine.
We just have to...
Lukas has to get out of here, as soon as possible.
Are you completely mad?
- Get down! The window!
I got kind of bored.
You go north, towards Deutenham.
Then you head for Passau and you keep going north... until you get to the sea.
And then you ask for a ship going to New York.
Do you understand?
Florian! Stop it!
You leave early tomorrow!
You promised!
Yeah, yeah! Due north all the way.
And don't you dare come back...
I almost forgot!
Because I was always so bored...
I couldn't remember the "B" at first, but then...
It's so I can find my way back, when they'll let me come back...
Do you think the people there are nice, in America?
What...
Can I stay with you tonight?
Here on this bed, this is where I was born.
Old Nane told me so.
It's like a cycle... where everything comes around... full circle.
Do you understand what I'm...?
Yes.
Now that Rosalind is my mother,
I have to see her again before I go to America.
What, but you can't possibly...
When it gets dark.
I have to.
He's up there!
Pickled pig's feet, forty fucking flies, flirting... free... assholes, assholes...
I'm Lukas.
Lukas... your son, because old Nane...
This is St. Luke.
Old Nane gave it to me, for my journey.
I'm setting you free and then...
Why?
But... you're my mother...
You're HIS son, too.
Hillinger's son.
Hurry up... get the others...
Well, I have to go now...
I'm off to America I guess...
Well, then, mother, until we meet again...
There he is, over there.
Follow him, you idiots!
Where is he?
We'll never catch him this way.
He knows the area, and people will be helping him.
Maybe we can...
The one-seventh farmers, we'll go there.
A farmer returns to his farm when there's danger.
A farmer?
And that night
Rosalind lay down and died.
Just like that.
Fouuundling!
Where are you?
Bitch! Dirty whore!
Lukas, no!
It's a trap!
You must not...
A farmer can't...
It's a crazed animal... that must be destroyed.
Not having been able to... at least shake his hand one last time... that was the worst part of all, at the time.
No bells tolled, and they wanted to bury him in secret during the week... so no one would be able to attend.
But everyone went in spite of that, all the peasants, and nobody fed the animals that day.
Emmy and Florian and myself, we left the farm after that.
But there were only three cows left anyway, and the stable boy was a hard worker and with old Nane...
And I fixed things with Danninger, too.
Maybe now the three of us will go to America.

{7187}{7218}I learned this|in training, sir.
{7219}{7310}Oh, really. In this case,|I might explain one thing,

{7502}{7543}I am sorry, sir, I do not know ...

{16148}{16198}Absolutely, and you know why?
{16201}{16241}Because they hate you!
{16244}{16292}And if you do not learn|to hate them too,

{16927}{16967}Okay, people, relax ...
{16968}{17025}and then prepare|for advancement.
{17027}{17047}Captain...
{17114}{17169}it seems that we visit,|creatures ...
{17170}{17224}But as passed|By our traps?
{17253}{17299}Traps|They were not armed.
{17335}{17366}Because?
{17367}{17409}Captain, I thought ...
{17458}{17507}I'm sure|which I have laid the explosives ...
{17508}{17570}Half of our food and ammunition|They were here, Hawthorne!
{17571}{17634}Things much more needed|than a doctor!
{17788}{17845}I want a full inventory|all that's left.
{17847}{17908}Nobody touches anything,|unless they are clean.
{17911}{17958}The whole place should|be contaminated.
{18414}{18450}Can I sit here?
{18476}{18497}Of course...
{18653}{18732}Hawthorne ...|what are you doing here?
{18807}{18862}I started college|medicine when the government
{18863}{18905}He began recruiting people.
{18919}{18987}They said that the aliens|persium wanted, and it was
{18988}{19071}our responsibility|protect what was rightfully ours.
{19165}{19226}I thought coming here was|the right decision.
{19255}{19298}So you're an idealist?
{19346}{19373}Yeah, I think it was ...
{19374}{19418}All right, guys, listen ...
{19469}{19540}Just make contact|one of our satellites.
{19541}{19612}I found that has a factory|alien ammunition in the region
{19614}{19684}and it seems that the plant enters|operating in 31 hours.
{19685}{19761}And if it does, the creatures go|stay in great advantage here.
{19762}{19826}Perhaps, is what is missing|to manage to drive us out.
{19828}{19899}We are the only unit|You can get there in time, folks.
{19900}{19929}That's it...
{20128}{20157}What is the problem?
{20353}{20382}What's it?
{20480}{20523}Take a look|for you it?
{20526}{20571}What about you?
{20574}{20631}Do not remember|as the earth was before?
{20651}{20732}Forty years ago, the electricity|It is missing everywhere.
{20733}{20787}And it caused|chaos in the cities.
{20788}{20847}Countries came into war|for energy, yes!
{20852}{20962}Yeah, and thanks to us all, countries|Earth got the persium
{20963}{21029}for heating and food|people, to touch the economy ...
{21051}{21096}The Earth not|It is most needed,
{21098}{21141}It is no longer necessary|They kill each other.
{21141}{21200}And when the Earth could|finally be at peace,
{21201}{21276}the beasts came and put everything|all this at risk.
{21341}{21435}So, when you feel|tired and hungry
{21436}{21482}and even with a little|of fear, think about it
{21484}{21518}and never forget!
{21528}{21605}Right, sir!|- Well, we leave in three hours ...
{22020}{22068}It has tunnels throughout the region.
{22070}{22166}If we continue in this direction, we will|arrive at an abandoned mine.
{22168}{22223}We may use the recesses|the mine to reach
{22225}{22255}in the ammunition factory.
{22267}{22329}How far?|- 45 km ...
{22365}{22442}Great. We are on a planet|where the night lasts six months,
{22443}{22487}and we are walking|in caves.
{22488}{22511}Rosen ...
{22512}{22593}He complained that much during|the training of lack of sun?
{22594}{22633}No, sir, he slept well ...
{23025}{23055}I think we have company ...
{23057}{23089}Hear that?
{23089}{23113}What?
{23190}{23223}Archer, what do you see?
{23338}{23372}Only we, sir ...
{23445}{23480}The area is free ...
{23549}{23600}Well, I hope|it stays that way ...
{24515}{24530}Hang on...
{24562}{24599}Archer, use the scanner ...
{24837}{24915}The satellite shows a laser network|just ahead, Captain.
{24915}{24952}I can see well.
{24953}{25014}It should be ready|to explode.
{25050}{25116}You can remove the detonator with|a special grenade, Sergeant?
{25117}{25163}I've got one here.|- Do it...
{25532}{25557}Fell one!
{25653}{25693}What is it, who fell?
{25693}{25721}I thought it was you ...
{25778}{25801}What's it?
{25808}{25834}What happened?
{25835}{25892}Nothing, sir, we|disassemble the trap.
{25893}{25944}It's my fault, I thought|who had requested help ...
{26026}{26052}It's all right...
{26060}{26110}it is better to err on the side ...
{26139}{26182}Well, it will be|increasingly difficult,
{26183}{26241}there may be many pitfalls|ahead.
{26242}{26278}Perhaps even sentries.
{26302}{26350}We will immunize|before leaving.
{26973}{27081}From what I can tell, sir, the valve|internal exhaust is blocked.
{27082}{27158}Each time it was triggered,|the internal pressure increased,
{27159}{27194}until the passage closed.
{27196}{27244}I think it was when|They reached the station.
{27249}{27304}One of the bullets must have passed|Close enough,
{27305}{27354}to have reached the valves|without achieving anything more.
{27355}{27408}Therefore, the ejection seems|not be broken.
{27409}{27481}Captain, means not received my|doses since I left the station.
{27690}{27752}I'm fine, Eldritch ...|- Yeah I know...
{27830}{27894}Our guns reserves|They lost with the supplies.
{27894}{27939}This means|A big problem.
{28004}{28050}What do you suggest|I do, Corporal?
{28136}{28193}We can try to change|our own guns
{28195}{28232}and dose the lieutenant|with them.
{28233}{28263}It will work?
{28314}{28352}Maybe...|- Oh, no, no, no ...
{28353}{28428}I will not risk other members|the group by a perhaps cable!
{28577}{28637}Captain, we do not|We have no alternative.
{28638}{28718}I try to take another medication for|while, but if the Lieutenant Rosen
{28720}{28822}find another creature, chances|of infection they are too big.
{29040}{29061}Lieutenant,
{29064}{29140}this plant begins operating|for 22 hours.
{29142}{29229}I need you, and you know the risk.|- I understand that, sir ...
{29248}{29299}At the first sign of infection,
{29347}{29385}you stay alone ...
{29836}{29894}I only see a sentry|the mine entrance.
{29896}{29924}What you see, Archer?
{29946}{30018}Are other funds for a|good reception of the satellite, Captain.
{30019}{30066}If there are still enemies|in the area,
{30095}{30128}I will not pick them up ...
{30183}{30229}He must have rear.
{30258}{30308}Sure, silence total.
{30309}{30337}Hit it.
{30678}{30737}What are you waiting for,|It is an easy target!
{30738}{30784}If hit him now,|it falls in the open,
{30785}{30852}so if you do not want the site|which can be seen ...
{31140}{31207}What's it?|- Anything...
{31567}{31591}Damn it...
{31593}{31624}She missed!
{31725}{31759}He fell...
{31762}{31787}Good job!
{31789}{31841}But what happened?|- I do not know, sir ...
{31843}{31912}But, I know, of course, Captain,|she caught the germ, it is infected.
{31913}{31979}It's not possible. I tested her blood|an hour ago, I was normal ...
{31980}{32021}Coming from you,|does not mean much ...
{32021}{32044}Enough!
{32185}{32207}Archer?
{32221}{32260}You can see the sentry?
{32300}{32339}I'm not sure, Captain!
{32392}{32416}Eldritch,
{32418}{32511}take Archer and Hawthorne, return|àquela mine and explode it.
{32519}{32587}Do not forget immunization.|I'm going back.
{32587}{32630}Captain, I think|It is not a good ideia...
{32631}{32679}Just give an order,|sergeant!
{32692}{32719}Yes sir...
{33123}{33197}Okay, talk ... what's happening?|- I do not know well, sir ...
{33197}{33219}You can speak...
{33286}{33348}Something happened|me at the station, sir.
{33350}{33408}I've never been so close|the one before.
{33420}{33473}I saw his face|when I shot ...
{33521}{33578}That image|not on my mind ...
{33589}{33626}And when I think about it ...
{33684}{33734}almost feel|a killer ...
{33737}{33793}Killed a creature|who was trying to kill you ...
{33794}{33845}Just acted like it was trained.
{33859}{33885}I know...
{33900}{33955}Maybe I did not serve|to be welded ...
{34027}{34046}Rosen ...
{34053}{34077}Yes sir...
{34103}{34132}I know it has|many people on Earth
{34133}{34197}who believes not|if you need more war ...
{34222}{34322}But it takes more than a few decades|peace to change human nature.
{34358}{34394}You are voluntary|for this fight ...
{34395}{34444}and I've seen what you can do ...
{34446}{34525}And I have no doubts|I'm a soldier.
{34597}{34643}But if you lose|your confidence,
{34644}{34722}you become a drag on|this group and to herself.
{34777}{34861}You're second in command|because I trust you to protect me.
{34890}{34933}If you can no longer|do that...
{34934}{34979}it is better to say now ...
{35053}{35096}I can continue, sir ...
{35158}{35182}Come on...
{35535}{35580}And the explosions, Sergeant!
{35582}{35638}We are finishing putting|detonators, Captain!
{35639}{35724}Just a few more minutes, sir ...|- Well, I'll patrol the area ...
{35734}{35775}Hawthorne, come with me!
{35779}{35839}Stay and mount the guard!
{35842}{35911}Keep good distance from that thing.|- That's not necessary, sir ...
{35912}{35993}I burned|and esterilizei the whole area.
{35995}{36062}The Rosen lieutenant not in danger|of infection here, sir!
{36064}{36110}I like your initiative, cable!
{36115}{36139}Yes sir...
{36180}{36206}Come on...
{36663}{36724}He does not have much way|soldier, right?
{36725}{36779}Why now,|he's a dead soldier!
{36780}{36837}And for all we know,|he could be a child!
{36875}{36921}That's what we are killing now?
{37000}{37031}Innocent civilians?
{37127}{37199}To tell the truth,|I do not care!
{37201}{37252}The aliens began|this war,
{37253}{37323}and in my opinion, each|one of them is a possible target.
{37331}{37400}And anything|load weapon, not a civil ...
{37401}{37451}I expect|do not forget that...
{37452}{37474}Mrs...
{37561}{37618}Still has something|on the other side, sir ...
{37861}{37918}{y:i} Quick, let's back,|let's back ...
{37968}{38004}{y:i} Where are you coming from?
{38005}{38031}{y:i} I do not know ...
{38539}{38558}{y:i} Captain ...
{38609}{38625}{y:i} Captain ...
{38654}{38678}{y:i} Hawthorne!
{39690}{39771}You all right, Hawthorne?|- I tried bio-regeneration ...
{39831}{39877}But nothing|I could do for him ... sir ...
{39930}{39963}The injuries were|enormous.
{39964}{40006}He was hit|more than 12 times in the chest.
{40160}{40208}There's no signs of pursuit,|Mrs!
{40209}{40260}The creatures should think|we die, Lieutenant.
{40488}{40519}What are you looking at?
{40543}{40615}These bullets, for me, do not look|have come from alien weapon!
{40699}{40759}Is this some kind of accusation,|Mrs?
{40760}{40796}I'm not accusing anyone|you are welcome!
{40798}{40874}No, you only suggesting that this|the captain was killed by our weapon.
{40875}{40903}We should investigate ...
{40927}{40951}Does that bother you?
{40952}{41045}To me, it was his mistake that left us|in this situation to begin with.
{41047}{41088}If it bothers someone,|it's you ...
{41089}{41131}The captain died|and no matter who is to blame.
{41167}{41222}We still have a mission|to do.
{41265}{41301}Yes it's true...
{41320}{41404}But I do not think the lieutenant|has condition to command!
{41405}{41447}I'm in charge, Sergeant!
{41481}{41555}Certainly, the Hawthorne cable|You think me capable of this task!
{41608}{41682}Yes for sure...
{41788}{41817}It's enough for me ...
{41818}{41862}What are the orders, Lieutenant?
{41905}{41999}To get there in time,|we can not take the captain together.
{42000}{42054}Take everything from him, let's go.
{42129}{42159}Yes ma'am!
{42556}{42603}Already we should be close.
{42605}{42629}That's it.
{42845}{42922}Lieutenant, we are|just below the plant.
{44178}{44200}What do you see?
{44202}{44320}The broadcast shows various creatures|in the workplace. There are two of them here.
{44335}{44406}Let's approach the|service corridors.
{44407}{44454}Okay, I'll give you that.
{44456}{44547}Lieutenant, I think it's time|yet another blood sample.
{44674}{44722}So take a look.|In silence...
{44943}{44996}Well, your luck|still persists, sir.
{45005}{45051}The blood is clean.
{45070}{45106}No spirochetes traits.
{45204}{45267}You know psychosis caused|by spirochetes?
{45271}{45339}Well, just the ones I've seen in videos|training.
{45340}{45413}Nothing you've seen in action,|certainly.
{45480}{45545}In fact, I never saw|psychosis in action.
{45564}{45598}No single case.
{45659}{45701}I had not thought.
{45998}{46034}Drugs of our guns ...
{46041}{46082}You know how they work?
{46091}{46161}Well, I do not give|many medical details, lady!
{46197}{46286}But I heard that the alien DNA|It is quite different from ours.
{46287}{46341}And it's hard to deal with it.
{46348}{46432}Therefore, drugs are genetically|produced for each individual.
{46434}{46506}But other than that,|The composition is confidential.
{46664}{46710}It is concerned|with something, ma'am?
{46794}{46847}Remember I asked you|why are you here?
{46854}{46868}Yeah...
{46923}{46974}I'm wondering|the same thing.
{47022}{47046}Lieutenant,
{47051}{47130}With all the respect,|I think ... that lady
{47131}{47173}should remember|than the captain said ...
{47174}{47214}because he was right.
{47221}{47261}Our mission|here is important.
{47312}{47355}I'm not so sure.
{47379}{47439}Lieutenant, I do not know well|what do you mean by that,
{47440}{47513}but I suggest you not discuss it|in front of Eldritch Sgt.
{47514}{47556}If you want|continue in command.
{47640}{47695}Well over an examination|no problem, lady ...
{47736}{47801}What lies ahead?|- Hard to say, lady!
{47802}{47870}The equipment energy emission|of them interfere with our sensors.
{47872}{47974}But they are low on defense. And ten|or more enemies in the area, ma'am.
{47976}{48002}What do you recommend?
{48004}{48072}Make the low attack.|A quick action.
{48072}{48108}Let's get ready ...
{48192}{48295}Lieutenant, guns need replenishing.|You want me to take care of it now.
{48296}{48320}Yes, proceed ...
{48320}{48357}I will recolhar empty.
{49522}{49549}Everybody immunized?
{49558}{49579}Yes ma'am...
{49580}{49630}Yes ma'am...|- Yes ma'am...
{50618}{50640}Lieutenant?
{50680}{50709}I'm in position.
{50800}{50829}I am too...
{50915}{50949}All ready, Lieutenant ...
{51357}{51409}{y:i} Production|It begins in a few hours ...
{51548}{51568}Draw back ...
{51582}{51597}What?
{51598}{51656}{y:i} Withdraw-up, cancel, it's an order ...|- Because?
{51663}{51699}They're not aliens ...
{51793}{51824}Mr...
{52042}{52124}What do you think you're doing,|there were at least twelve aliens there ...
{52124}{52168}No, they're human beings ...
{52168}{52217}You are not well...|- Listen to me...
{52238}{52282}You remember what happened|at the station?
{52283}{52311}What it|It has to do with it?
{52312}{52342}You listen to me!
{52404}{52433}What did you see?
{52434}{52459}I saw a creature ...
{52463}{52505}I shot and missed ...
{52529}{52644}Think, concentrate as much as possible|at that time ... what he saw there ...
{52754}{52783}What did you see?
{52855}{52891}What did you see?
{52944}{52973}Era...
{53039}{53104}It was ... a creature,|as I said...
{53181}{53205}And you?
{53248}{53303}I only saw a second,|Lieutenant, maybe less ...
{53305}{53342}Think again what ...|what he saw ...
{53443}{53474}I'm not sure...
{53685}{53759}Yeah ... maybe|were human ...
{53946}{53960}And they were ...
{53970}{54018}There were no aliens|that station.
{54116}{54159}And there is not any here ...
{54161}{54206}So, as explained|what we have seen?
{54207}{54277}I do not know right, can be a|type of memory implant ...
{54277}{54313}I can not handle it anymore!
{54313}{54378}You're crazy and is trying|crazy in too ...
{54379}{54430}How we do not realize|this before?
{54442}{54488}The drugs we take|Immunization!
{54493}{54541}Should strengthen|the implant's memory.
{54543}{54618}When my gun spoiled,|my implant began to fail ...
{54619}{54692}Yeah, but your gun spoiled|because you got shot.
{54785}{54845}And as we can see|with these implants?
{54958}{55008}Is that sabotaged their guns!
{55039}{55112}Traded drugs tubes|by a supply of glucose!
{55114}{55154}For them to see the truth ...
{55214}{55241}I kill you...
{55242}{55287}Please sergeant,|the path is not this!
{55289}{55361}Good advice, cable,|should listen to yourself ...
{55564}{55590}What's with you?
{55591}{55648}Both want to fight, that|They do not call anymore who they kill?
{55744}{55803}You had no right|to fuss with guns!
{55804}{55870}This is a court-martial case|you can run.
{55871}{55950}Lieutenant, you are risking|our lives, just for a belief.
{55952}{55984}It is more than a belief!
{55989}{56032}I've had several close contacts|with the enemy
{56033}{56111}without drugs to protect me ...|and I'm still healthy ...
{56128}{56169}Why I was not infected?
{56200}{56239}There's no bacteria|alien!
{56241}{56286}Because there is not|alien!
{56287}{56332}If I was conditioning|like you said,
{56333}{56406}because when I look at you I see|a person, not a creature?
{56440}{56529}The images are formed in some way,|perhaps electronically.
{56531}{56610}And to what's such a complicated job,|just to create an enemy ...
{56677}{56710}The person|I killed at the station,
{56730}{56782}I think part|Asian Coalition ...
{56821}{56852}Our government knew|we could not convince
{56853}{56919}to a war|only to protect their profits ...
{56932}{57013}So, I decided to turn|miners in aliens.
{57014}{57072}What would be enemies|for our minds.
{57113}{57156}They made us|brainwashed ...
{57158}{57215}To kill|other human beings.
{57215}{57262}That's crazy!|- Oh yes...
{57298}{57334}Well, there's a way|to prove ...
{58075}{58103}My God!
{58166}{58233}Are here. Flee!
{58238}{58286}{y:i} Let us flee!
{58310}{58334}{y:i} Flee all ...
{58338}{58370}{y:i} Get out, flee ...
{58404}{58458}They have terrified us ...|- Of course you've got ...
{58459}{58497}Think|we will kill them ...
{58501}{58535}And got right ...
{59106}{59125}Listen...
{59137}{59161}please...
{59173}{59218}You do not have to be afraid...
{59235}{59278}Now we know the truth!
{59290}{59317}Yes, that's it!
{59339}{59389}This is where the killing stops!
{59643}{59676}No, no, no ... okay ...
{59676}{59715}No one will hurt you!
{59731}{59753}Please...
{59827}{59863}you do not have to be afraid...
{60017}{60057}We know the truth now!
{60069}{60108}We will not hurt you!
{60382}{60467}No, we know ...|they're human.
{60470}{60513}We did not come to fight ...
{60755}{60794}Disgusting creature!
{60873}{60909}No, do not go near!
{60933}{60976}Have to|be immunized first!
{61158}{61211}{y:i} Humans kill for love,
{61212}{61259}{y:i} for revenge, for survival,
{61260}{61304}{y:i} and even for ideas.
{61326}{61374}{y:i} Perhaps the capacity to kill then
{61375}{61455}{y:i} is a very true part of our nature
{61470}{61521}{y:i} But within this behavior,
{61522}{61570}{y:i} defined by fear,
{61572}{61618}{y:i} must we also be taught
{61620}{61652}{y:i} to hate?
In 1933 "Aliat HaNo'ar" was established to save children from the danger of extermination at the hands of the Nazis.
During and after the war its representatives continued to gather children from their hiding places and brought the survivors to Israel where they built their homes.
Scores of youth villages were set up for this purpose and they absorbed 300 thousand children and adolescents.
The movie "Under The Domim Tree" is dedicated to this marvelous organization.

They've found him.
We should have taken care of him.
"There" we always took care of him.
Now the two of us are all alone.
Two of us are not all alone.
We should've gone with him.
Don't even think that way.
We couldn't have done anything.
Nothing at all.
Summer, 1953
My dear Aviya,
I'm going to Germany.
To see about our reparations.
Maybe things will finally work out for us with this money.
I went to see your mother.
She's still in the psychiatric ward.
It seems that she'll be there for a long time.
Enclosed are two photographs of your father.
I have a better one somewhere.
If I find it,
I'll send it to you.
Take care.

It's not about the Holocaust
I'm talking about my family..
Calm down.
- Isn't it enough that they killed your parents?
Shut up!
It's not about the money.
It's a matter of principle.
Money for blood.
No reparations.
And that's final.
But it's money, Yurek.
Money.
I deserve that money.
It won't bring your Parents back to life. -No.
But at least I'd have something for my future.
We're not talking about you.
We're talking about our country.
Quite please.
Where are your manners?
You're in the dining hall.
I'm sorry, Rachel. They've been arguing since yesterday.
There's no argument.
We all agree, except Sara B.
Zevik, I can hear you even when you don't shout. Sit down.
But I'm the monitor.
The committee has to discuss this before the children...
Rachel, they are old enough...
- Later
I want to introduce to you a new girl who's joining us.
This is Miriam Segal.
- Mira.
Excuse me?
- Mira. My name is Mira.
This is Mira. I'm sure you'll help her fit in, and make her feel at home.
Good luck, Mira. -I'm Ariel.
Let me introduce you?
Ayala, Aviya, Daniel.
She'll be in your room.
Pass me a knife. -Tell her she can take off the hat.
Zevik, the tea's not hot.
- That's what there is.
Don't I eat get any fish?
Vegetarian table.
- I don't eat grass. look what she's eating.
Miss Sarah B is on a diet.
She's not like the other fat girls in the group!
No, Miss Sarrah B is special, she's from Warsaw.
Stop Shouting.
You're making me death.
You look like your from the ghetto.
Yurek's little servant.
Did you hear that, Yurek?
I'm from the ghetto.
Always on Yurek's back.
- leave him alone Sarah.
The bed unfolds like this.
In the morning, you fold it back under the other bed.
Every morning. Why can't it stay out like the rest?
I'm not a sucker.
- Who said you were?
Every year we draw lots for the shelves and the beds.
Who was here before me?
Dita. Her mother married an American millionaire and took her to America.
- Yeah, sure.
This is your shelf.
Put your things here.
Where's your suitcase?
- This is the all I have.
When your shoes are dirty, you leave them outside.
What a figure Sarah.
Congratulations.
It's "Bez" in Poland now.
- No, it's not.
What month is this?
No, in Polish.
June. "Czerwiec".
- Yes, "Bez" in June.
The leaves are already dropping, and when you walk on them they make a sound like: crik, crik, crik.
No, it sounds like:
Chak, chak, chak.
Leaves fall, girls.
They fall.
And you step on them.
Fall. Drop.
What's the difference?
"Bez" is in October,
In the autumn.
And the snow is up to here.
And when you walk on it, there's no sound at all.
I have soap in my eyes.
Isn't there a laundry in this institution?
There is, but we wash our underwear ourselves.
It's personal.
It's your own.
I don't care about the
Poles or the Fascists.
Yurek, why do you get so angry when we talk about it?
Say your sorry or
I'll kill you. -Kiss my ass.
Stop it.
Yurek, what about?
- They're going crazy again.
Yurek.
- Run, run.
What are you staring at?
Get inside.
Why are you all standing there like that? It's late.
Tell them to stop?
Don't you dare open it?
Nobody raises their voice or their hand to me.
Go stop them now.
- They'll stop by themselves.
I've been telling you for months that they must be separated.
If you don't do it, I will.
- Not now.
You don't learn from your mistakes. Need I remind you? of Misha? -Are you saying
Misha was my fault?
I'm not saying that?
But you don't want it to happen again, do you?
Everyone here thinks he's an expert.
It's the first time they're like that since Misha drowned.
I thought they were cured.
Will they be like animals all their lives?
If you want to talk, go outside.
I want to sleep.
Look at them now.
Acting as if they're normal.
Shut up? Pain in the neck.
- I knew mental cases like them.
Shut up.
- Hey, what's going on here?
It's because of yesterday's discussion.
Things I want to forget keep creeping into my head.
You're not the only one, chavy.
I think... -You think?
I think...
We have the right and the obligation to talk about it.
What do you say, girls?
I wasn't "there".
I have no right to judge.
I think we should take as much money as we can.
Shut up. You're both sabras.
Don't yell like that.
I say we should take as much as we can.
I need the money for my future.
All you think about is money.
No blood money.
End of discussion.
In the end, everyone will take the money.
Do you want to bet?
I'm ready to bet with anyone.
Sarah, what do you mean by
"my" money, "my" future?
We all have the same future.
Building the Kibbutz together.
Do you think I want to spend my life in this group?
I've had enough all these years.
I want to wake up alone.
Go to sleep alone.
Without 4 other girls.
I've had enough of all this "togetherness".
I want to go study.
Succeed. Alone.
Did you hear that Yurek?
I've decided to break up with Sarah B.
Then I'll break up with Ayala.
- But she's not your girlfriend.
If she were,
I'd break up with her.
What do you think of Ayala?
For me or for you?
What do you say?
For you, for you.
Woman give me a headache.
I give up.
Are your hands clean?
This is for you.
Very funny.
He's mad because
I tell him what I think.
You can't take it when someone disagrees with you.
It's tough for you to digest.
- Digest. What Hebrew?
We should all learn from Sarah B.
- I digest, you digest.
Laugh. Even my Hebrew's better than yours.
Right Yurek?
Aviya, come here for a minute.
Who me?
- He's talking to you, isn't he?
What's your answer?
- To what? -My letter.
What letter?
- The one I just gave you.
You gave me a ball of paper.
- Did you throw it away?
Read it.
So?
- What?
What did you want?
I liked what you said today:
"I wasn't there.
I have no right to judge".
Is that why you called me?
- No.
I like how you speak.
Short. Staccato.
What?
- Staccato, "ta, ta, ta, ta."
Is that good or bad?
- Typical Sabra.
What?
Well.
- Wait a minute.
What, do Sabras shake hands?
Here comes Vim.
- Hi Vim.
Oudim Family, let's welcome our friends returning from Holland, led by our dear
Vim Van Fliman.
To them, he's a hero of the Dutch underground.
To us, he's a simple gardener and leader of our Dutch group.
O.K. One moment, please.
This is really wonderful.
I. O.K. Now I'll speak in Dutch, because I can't find the words in Hebrew.
I was visiting her majesty
Queen Juliana, with my Jewish children that I hid during the war.
Enough. I'm O.K. now.
I have a surprise.
The sack, please.
This sack has gifts from my friends in the Resistance, for all the school.
But I need "volunteers".
Who wants?
- Me! Me! Me!
For Vim's a jolly good fellow.
Yes. That will do.
What happened?
- It's your fault.
"Unfold the bed, fold the bed".
Everything's falling apart and it's not my fault.
You're wasting your time.
It'll just break again.
How long has this envelope been here?
You know that you're in charge of the mail this week?
Why are you making such a big deal?
Since you arrived, there's been nothing but problems.
Go cry under your stupid tree.
For me, you don't exist.
And if you call me a bitch again,
I'll smack you both.
You understand Polish?
- "You understand Polish?"
Vim?
- Yes.
Why did you take the tractor?
We're planting.
- Are you crazy?
Planting Tulips in the summer.
It's too hot.
We're planting Tulips to the north.
You're wasting your time.
Poor children.
There's not even a drop of water here.
I read in book.
Once, many Tulips in Israel.
Soon, this place very beautiful.
What's this?
"Nabatean Farming".
The Nabateans lived here over 2,000 years ago.
The Nabateans know the secrets.
Soon, will be miracle here.
What are you doing with the stones? You're nuts.
The Nabateans...
We shape the stone to catch water.
And who told you, you could take the tractor?
It's O.K.
- No. It's not O.K. at all.
I'll talk to Rachel about this.
"Home sweet home we go".
Can I come with you?
- Not this time Yurek.
We have a wonderful house with a tile roof.
You stick your head out the window and plums fall into your mouth.
I'm not sure you'll get along very well with my mother.
You can gossip in Polish?
I forgot that horrible language.
This time I have to go alone.
I'll take the photo out like this?
What?
What is it?
- Untie it.
Your hair. Untie it.
Tie it up.
You mean braid it?
You "braid" hair.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
My Dad would be happy.
- And his wife?
I'm going to see him, not her.
I like it here when everyone's gone.
At last, I get some privacy.
What, do Sabras shake hands?
Last one to the gate, washes the floor.
Is he coming?
He said he would come today?
Mama,
I brought you flowers.
I grew them myself.
- Henya, you have a visitor.
Don't talk to her like that, she's not a little girl.
Do you want to go out for some fresh air?
You're not dressed warmly enough. You'll catch a cold.
I'm O.K.
It's very warm today.
Yes, warm.
Who gave you that photo?
- Aunt Alice.
She sent it to me before she left.
She went to Germany?
To get our money from the Germans.
There's no reason to go there.
They're all dead. I saw.
They're all dead, in the woods of Narosdj.
Is this my father? -My father, my brother, my husband, they're all dead. I saw.
- Mama, you weren't there.
You came to Israel before the war.
Don't tell me where I was.
You fool. You know nothing.
Isn't this from "there?"
Isn't this from "there?"
- What is that?
Is the doctor blind?
Shut the windows, I don't want the neighbors to hear.
They don't need to know what's going on in my house.
Tell me about him, mama.
I have to know.
It says here "Kaybeach".
Who's "Kaybeach?"
From Haifa.
- I want the nurse.
I'll call her in a minute.
You have to tell me. Please?
I need to know.
Who's Kaybeach?
Tell me something, Mama.
I have to know.
We're alone again, Yurek.
Just the two of us.
That's not enough for you.
You want to be all alone.
"Alone" means you and me.
What do you see in her?
Is it her braid?
I can make one too.
You mean "braid" one, Sarah.
You braid hair.
Stop, Sarah.
It's over between us.
What we had can never be over.
It's forever.
Then promise me we'll stay friends?
No matter what.
Always.
Did you hear?
They found Yola's father.
He's alive in Poland.
- What? -Yes.
Avi, why are you back so soon?
Didn't you go visit your mother?
Did you hear?
- Yes. -It's unbelievable.
They called me into the office.
I saw Rutka, the nurse, sitting with Rachel and Ariel.
Then, Rachel hugged me and said:
Yola, it's a miracle.
You are not an orphan anymore.
They found your father.
He's alive in Warsaw, in Poland.
We've heard that story, it's getting boring.
You should be ashamed.
My father's alive.
Can you believe it?
He's alive.
It's amazing.
My father is alive.
He had these big "Lappas".
- What?
Lappas.
Big hands.
That used to wrap up my little hands.
Soon, Yola. Soon you'll be holding his "Lappas".
I'd give anything to see my father just once.
Do you remember him?
He died before I was born.
Maybe it's better that way.
To be an orphan from the start.
Sometimes, memories can kill.
So, how's Yola?
- So how's Sarah B.
You didn't go see your mother, did you?
Leave me alone. I have enough problems. -What do you mean?
You and Sarah B.
I saw you together, as if...
As if what?
It's over between me and Sarah.
It's final.
I missed you.
Yurek. Avi.
Wait a minute?
Can I come with you?
It was just by chance, right?
What happened to Yola,
It couldn't happen to someone else, could it?
Am I right?
It's a miracle.
What's this?
- To Yola.
It's for me.
- Yola, when you're in Poland, try to find this man for me.
- Janek Tilas.
- He's my father.
- Thank you and come back soon. Menachem Tilas.
"Mailbox For Letters To Poland"
Where's Yola? She received a package from Poland.
A package arrived?
What a tiny dress. Doesn't he know how old you are?
He probably remembers you when you were little.
No. This dress isn't for me.
When I was small,
I had a doll this size.
It's for my doll.
I'm sure he just wanted to make me laugh.
O.K. girls, let's get Yola ready for her trip to Poland.
We'll embroider her shirt.
- No, two.
One for the trip and one to celebrate the Sabbath.
Shoulders, 87.
Boobs.
79. You got bigger.
Waist.
Tushie.
A package arrived from Poland?
- Not now. Later.
Try this on.
- It's so beautiful.
Try it on.
- I can't.
My aunt says that it's forbidden.
You only buy new things for a baby after he's born.
Let's see how you'll look when you meet him.
Let's pretend you just got off the plane.
Wearing Israeli clothes in Poland. Can you imagine?
In Warsaw, with the clothes we made.
Yola.
Only 60 more hours.
Lod - Zurich,
Zurich - Paris,
Paris - Vienna,
Paris - Vienna, yes.
Vienna - Warsaw.
- Vienna - Warsaw.
Miss Yola Mintz.
Miss Yola Mintz.
Not Yola, Yolanda,
Yolanda Mintz.
If he hears Yola, he won't know it's me.
People only call me
Yola here.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Wait. I forgot.
How do you say:
"How are you?"
And "Where have you been all these years?"
Right.
And
"I love you Papa?"
Come on, let's pack.
First the winter clothes.
We'll put that in last.
And last but not least,
Rutka's coat.
Wait, we forgot something.
Bon voyage, Lalka.
Not so much water.
Just a little.
Vim, are you sure it'll work?
Look.
A plant needs three things:
For the body for the heart, and for the head.
Water, for the body.
Love for the heart.
And the Nabateans for the head.
But, it's a secret.
Yola, Rutka wants to see you.
Don't dance with anyone else.
I'll be back.
Whoever is not in this group, please leave now.
Your counselors are waiting for you.
My dear children.
I have no words of comfort.
We all shared in Yola's joy, and now we share her grief.
I know that it's difficult.
- Where's Yola now?
In her room.
She's been taken care of.
I have a lot of letters for Poland.
What shall I do with them?
I'll take care of it, Yola.
- No, I will.
We must end this.
Come with me, Yola.
Wash her face.
Lie her down in her room.
And close the shutters.
Yola, go rest.
It's heavy.
Damn. I can't stop myself from crying.
I'm O.K. now.
Yola wants to return the clothes you gave her.
There's no hurry.
- It can wait.
Go rest, Rutka.
Yes Rutka. I'm O.K.
Here's your coat.
I just want to unpack the suitcase.
Why is Chavy crying?
Is she sick?
Don't just stand there, help her.
Look at what my aunt sent me.
For my trip to Poland.
I didn't even try them on.
My aunt sent me long underwear.
She's completely crazy.
She wants me to travel like this?
I ask you. To Poland.
Do you travel to Poland like this?
Dressed like this?
Do you travel to Poland like this?
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Miss Yolanda Mintz.
Do you travel to Poland like this? Like this?
My father will run away if he sees me like this.
What hysteria.
You would think.
She thought he was dead, didn't she?
Well now she's sure.
- Shut up. You monster.
You're better off.
- Shut your mouth.
One day you might go to Poland, and you'll be able to visit his grave.
Get out.
You filthy.
Stop.
Stop it immediately.
Wash your face.
Take your things and go to your room.
Look at what those animals did to me.
I could kill them one by one.
What did I say that was so terrible?
At least she knows for sure that he's dead.
Think about it.
All those thoughts.
Alive. Dead.
Now she knows that he's dead, and she can visit his grave.
Who else here has a grave that they can visit?
The most important thing is a grave with a headstone.
Do you hear me?
I'm talking to you.
Is there anyone up there?
I can hardly see.
I'm up here.
I'll be down in a minute.
"Kaybeach, Haifa"
Are you running away?
I'm not going anywhere, and you didn't see me.
Cause if you leave,
I'm taking your bed.
Where are you going in Haifa?
Uptown or downtown?
I don't know.
I don't know the city.
I'm going to visit someone that I don't know.
Stick with me. I know Haifa like the back of my hand.
Do you know someone named "Kaybeach?"
Kaybeach,
Kaybeach.
You can't live with a name like that.
Kaybeach is the area of cemeteries.
That's where I'm going.
Who are you looking for, my dear?
Your brother?
Your father?
- My father.
Was he in this regiment?
He died before I was born.
This is the military cemetery.
The older graves are over there.
"Max Alexandrovitch"
Papa.
Papa.
I brought you this flower.
It's from Holland.
Vim gave it to me.
He's our gardener at the boarding school.
I work with him.
Mama's very sick.
That's why I'm at the boarding school.
Watch over her, Papa.
And watch over me too.
I need someone to watch over me.
Yurek.
I did it. It's unbelievable.
I found him.
I found my father.
What's wrong?
Was Ariel looking for me?
This day is the most...
The most...
I think...
- Listen,
I have to do what I think is right.
We have to take care of the problem once and for all.
Don't worry. I won't let them be separated.
We'll come visit you.
You'll come visit us.
Zevik, Hadassim Boarding School is a great place.
It's a lot like our "Oudim".
Yurek.
Come on.
We'll come visit you in a week or so.
Have a safe trip.
- Don't worry.
So long, Zevik.
Guys, gather around.
I owe you an explanation.
Zevik is on his way to Hadassim...
He's going to Hadassim...
Take the dogs away.
Naomi. Listen to me.
They're search dogs.
Calm down.
They're here for the search.
This is all your fault.
We'll find them.
Do they have family. or friends? Anyone?
No. But they can live like this for months.
Like this? Outside?
They lived 2 years in a forest "there".
They were like animals when they were found.
Not "Like animals".
They were animals.
Don't ask me.
I don't have any answers.
But all these years that you've been together.
We don't talk about what happened "there".
I didn't tell them anything about me either.
What does anyone know about anyone else.
Even best friends don't know anything about each other.
But that can drive one crazy.
- So you go crazy.
But for how long?
Maybe for good.
Maybe for life.
Remember last winter when we searched for Misha?
We passed right through here.
I'm not going back there.
You're wasting your time.
They'll come back.
What's your problem?
Do your feet hurt?
Why are you making such a big deal?
If you were missing, it wouldn't be such a big deal at all.
Somebody should look down.
In the water.
Please eat.
We must continue searching.
It sticks in my throat.
I have a bad feeling.
You always think the worst.
Stop it.
I'm afraid to think what could've happened.
What could've happened?
There they are.
I told you they'd be back.
Either we stay together or we die.
You'll stay together, of course.
You'll stay together.
Let them breathe.
Come see.
The stupid psychologist is leaving.
Are you happy now?
Stop, Yoram.
Enough, Yoram. Yurek.
Stop, Yoram!
Yurek, turn of the water.
Stop the water.
Save it for the tulips.
Daniel.
Don't walk on Tulips.
What's going on now, Vim?
Why did you take all the hoses?
Couldn't you have left me even one?
Why are you making holes?
Are you crazy?
Look.
The water drips. Drip-drop.
- Drip-drop?
Drip, drip, drip.
Drip-drop.
And who'll pay for new hoses?
Maybe your Nabateans?
My invention.
Congratulations, Vim.
This is an agricultural revolution in Israel.
You should patent it.
- Maybe.
Hi, Yorem Klein.
- How do you like "Yoram"?
"Uri"?
- What's wrong with "Yurek"?
I want to change my name.
- Why is a name so important?
I don't understand.
- You can't understand.
Your life's another story.
- Do I even have a story?
I have a great life.
I'm on vacation here.
We shouldn't argue so much.
Maybe we should go out and have some fun.
And what about Zevik?
- Zevik's my problem.
He's not your problem.
Zevik's your problem.
I'm your problem.
Everyone's your problem.
- Don't be so dramatic.
You have no problems.
You have a wonderful house, you stick your head out and plums fall into your mouth.
You know what?
Let's go have some fun?
Let's go visit my mother.
Aviya, where are you taking me?
You said we were going to visit your mother.
Mama?
This is Yurek.
Mama, can you hear me?
I found him.
His name was on the tombstone.
I'll take you there.
We'll go together.
Just get out of here, and everything will be fine.
There's nothing left "there".
- Mama, you weren't there.
She wasn't there.
It's all in her head.
Speak to her in Polish.
Mama, he is from "there".
He speaks Polish.
Where do you live?
- Same place as Aviya.
How's your father? -My father?
I don't have one. -Your mother?
How's your mother?
- Mrs. Alexandrovitch?
What did she say?
She told me about the house, where you stick your head out the window, and plums fall into your mouth.
Some people want to forget where they've been, and others want to remember where they've never been.
How do you pronounce the letter "R"?
Mine sounds so foreign.
"Yurrrek".
But I like your rolling "R".
I want to pronounce it like you.
They say...
- Yurrrek's Aviya's Boyfrrriend.
No. "Ruthi runs by the Ararat River".
No. RRRuthi rrruns.
Come see.
Rruthi rrruns.
You have visitors.
Don't tease me.
Nobody came.
Who's here?
Nobody.
Tell me! Who is it?
- Some people.
What do they look like?
- I don't know. People.
A man and a woman.
They're short.
Wait! What should I tell them?
She's crazy.
My mistake.
They went on a trip and they'll be back late tonight.
We should've called first.
I have to go. Leave whatever you brought for her here.
That's her shelf.
What do you mean?
We don't have anything.
Why do you care so much about her?
Why don't you air out her smelly sheets?
That's exactly what I'm doing.
You're terrible, Ayala.
- She won't notice.
It looks better like that than it usually does.
What's with you?
Why are you doing this to her?
I owe it to her, OK?
Ayala! Stop it!
- Can I come in?
She hasn't returned yet?
It'll be morning soon.
We'll have to start a new search.
No, she'll be back.
After Zevik and Yurek,
I just don't know anymore.
They always come back.
Except Misha.
- Misha.
Right, Misha.
Get it into your head.
It wasn't your fault.
I can't believe we're waiting up for her.
I'm afraid something happened.
I'm awake.
I'm awake.
Why are you all awake so early?
We never went to sleep.
We were waiting up for you.
- Who made my bed?
Mira, are you OK?
Let us help you.
- Are you OK?
I'm taking off your dirty socks, OK?
I brought you some food.
Eat.
It's good.
You must eat.
Those people.
They're horrible.
They found me in Naples.
In Italy.
We arrived there by ship from Poland. -I told you.
I don't remember anything.
Except that I was in an orphanage. -Which one?
It was called "Dom Jetzka".
- That means "Children's house"
They're all called that.
We were in
"Dom Jetzka Jerusalem"
One day, they brought us to Israel.
The boat was filled with children.
Girls?
- Come in, Ariel.
Mira, we were worried.
Are you O.K.? -She is fine.
Sit. She's telling everything.
Go on.
Those people found me on the boat.
They said they we're my parents.
They bought me a big doll.
We lived in Afula.
Everything seemed fine, but I always knew
Something wasn't right.
Then she got sick, and he lost his job.
And he started to... my back is covered with scars from his beatings.
I couldn't stand it anymore, so, I ran away.
I never want to see them again.
I could kill them.
What's wrong with her?
What's going on?
Mira, what happened?
- Its them. Those people.
Miriam, wait.
Sir, the office is over there.
No need for police.
Miriam Segal is my daughter.
This is my wife,
Miriam's mother.
We want to see her.
She doesn't want to see them.
This is a scandal.
Let us see our daughter.
Please. Go to the office.
They'll help you.
What are you? Fascists?
Stealing peoples daughters.
She doesn't want to see you.
Please?
- He has a bad heart because of the Germans.
We only want to see our daughter!
Stop them.
- Please?
Is this how you steal children?
You should be ashamed.
I'll see you in jail.
Miriam?
- Come home with us?
Please?
You just wait.
This is just the beginning.
Can the court decide whether they're her parents?
We all dream that someday someone will come.
A father, a mother, someone.
From "there". And she.
I don't remember anything, but I know they're not my parents.
Then what do they want?
I bet it has something to do with the reparations.
If she can't remember, maybe they really are her parents.
Mira.
Calm down.
You have an excellent lawyer.
Everything will be fine.
You'll see.
Good luck.
- Good luck, Mira.
It'll be alright.
- Good luck.
Stop!
Tell Moussa to stop!
Mira?
- Stay there. I'm OK.
I must have eaten something.
Sit up front. OK, Moussa?
- No problem.
Get in, my child.
Sit.
Good morning.
Let's go.
Take the hat off, Mira.
But I like it.
You have nothing to hide.
You're so pretty.
You have lovely eyes.
"DISTRICT COURT
OF TEL AVIV"
I'm sorry, but you can't come inside.
Good luck, Ofra.
We're counting on you.
Mira, remember what we said?
- Stay calm and don't get upset.
- Let's go in.
All rise.
Approach the bench, please.
I suggest that you try to find a way, to avoid this hearing.
There's no room for compromise.
She must return to her parents.
- They're not my parents.
Your Honor, I'm sorry for the Segal's and the girl they lost in the war.
But they can't just replace her with another girl.
Before hearing the testimony,
I recommend that Mr. Segal take a blood test.
What?
- Although the blood test...
No test!
No blood!
Don't you believe
Jews here?
They already experimented on us.
Isn't that enough?
Wasn't Auschwitz enough?
- Me too. This is from Hitler.
All we want is our daughter.
Mira, daring.
Come with us.
How can you concentrate on trigonometry now?
Yes. They had a daughter?
She was four or five years old.
Today she must be big.
Then you can identify the girl?
Mr. Rosenberg, do you recognize the girl?
That's the girl.
It was years ago, mistakes have been made.
Maybe.
So here and there new families were created.
Nobody gets hurt.
But in this case,
I'm not mistaken.
But Mira's teacher testified that she noticed signs of violence, and suspected that Mira has been beaten.
I knew that the family. had survived the Holocaust.
That there was tension in the home.
Fears and rage.
Maybe they did hit the child from time to time.
Then they did beat her?
- Your Honor, this is irrelevant.
The issue is not whether they're ideal parents, but rather whether they're her parents or not.
And I state that they are.
I want you to wear this.
It'll look very nice on you.
Tell her to wear it.
It's brand new.
I've never worn it.
Quiet please.
- I told the judge that it was important for you to be with Mira.
You're everything she has.
He's agreed to let you sit inside, but you must all behave yourselves.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I've heard the testimony.
The time has come for my ruling.
Mira, Mira.
Don't worry.
My child, you claim that these are not your parents.
Then who are your parents?
Try to remember.
Your mother?
Your father?
A sister?
A brother?
Nothing.
I don't remember anything.
Try to remember something, someone?
Your Honor, the situation is very clear.
The girl has no evidence to refuse the claims made by her parents.
She must go home with them. for everyone's good.
These people claim that they're your parents, and that they love you.
If they're mistaken,
I need to know how they are mistaken.
Make an effort.
This is very important.
Give me a sign?
Anything?
Otherwise, you'll have to go home with them.
I think they were taller.
My mother was taller.
Am I tall or short?
When my children were little,
I seemed very big to them.
When you were little, you looked at your mother from down here.
Mira, you have two people here who want your happiness.
After all you and they have suffered, why don't you just go with them?
- I'd rather die.
Mira, think for a moment.
Miss...
We must move on.
Blue... -I have no choice but to rule that the girl...
I remember the color blue.
I can't hear you, my child. Speak up.
- I remember the color blue.
When I looked up at her, from here,
I saw blue.
She had blue eyes.
Very blue.
Not like mine.
They were blue.
She had dark eyelashes, like butterflies...
I can see her face.
I see my mother's face.
I see my mother's face.
Her teeth stuck out a bit, like mine...
My brother had the same teeth.
My brother, Antek.
His name was Antek.
Antek Rozner.
My mother is Ella Rozner.
My father is Menachem Rozner.
My name is Miriam Rozner.
And we lived in
Lubartovska St. in Lublin.
My name is not Segal.
They're the Segal's.
I want to be who I really am.
I want my name back.
How could I have forgotten them?
How could I have forgotten you, Mama?
And Papa?
And Antek?
How could I have forgotten my mother?
Don't leave me. I wanted so much to remember you, and I couldn't.
Please don't leave me.
I wanted so to remember.
Mira Rozner!
Mira Rozner!
"An old straw hat, and a wrinkled shirt,
"Not fancy you must say, "But we don't mind, for all day long,
"we laugh and sing away, ha-ha!"
We're going there the minute we arrive.
Where?
I can't wait.
Stop!
What is it, Vim?
Come and see.
Avi?
We can't go there now.
It's occupied.
The Domim tree is occupied.
UNDER THE DOMIM TREE
Translated by:
Jerry Hyman & Madeleine Ali
Subtitling:
Elrom Studios
One Sunday in 1 828 a ragged boy was found abandoned in the town of N.
He could hardly walk and spoke but one sentence.
Later, he told of being locked in a dark cellar from birth.
He had never seen another human being, a tree, a house before.
To this day no one knows where he came from - or who set him free.
Don't you hear that horrible screaming all round you?
That screaming men call silence?
THE ENlGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER
Writing. . .
Wri - ting!
Remember that: writing. lf you write nice now, papa'll give you nice horsey.
Horsey. . .
Horsey!
- Horse.
- Horse.
Horsey!
Repeat after me: l want to be a gallant rider. . .
. . .like my father was before me.
Say it! l want to be a gallant rider. . .
. . .like my father was before me!
Gallant rider.
Gallant rider like my father. . .
- Father. . .
- Father. . .
- . . .was before me.
- . . .was before me.
Remember that!
Remember that!
Come on now.
Stand here.
Hold this letter.
The letter. . .
Stay right here. . .
Wait here.
Wait for me here!
What do you want here?
Horsey! l'm asking you what you want here?
Like my father was before me!
Ah, maybe it's that you don't know your way around here?
Can l be of service? ls it that letter there. . .
. . .you're wanting to bring?
Let's have a look at it.
''To the Cavalry Captain of the Fourth Squadron. . .
. . .Sixth Schwolische Regiment.''
Let's see now, that'll be straight ahead. . .
. . .past Augustinergasse, round the corner, that's the Captain's house.
Should l take you there?
Or have you got other plans?
Say, where are from now?
Ansbach, Erlangen, Regensburg?
Regensburg!
Regensburg, good - come along now!
The young man here's from Regensburg. . .
. . .here's a letter for the Captain.
The Captain is not here.
He'll be in this evening.
Ah, but the young man is very weary.
Can't we find a place for him till then?
Not in the house, perhaps in the barn.
Horsey!
Right, with the horses on the straw.
There he can give the letter to the Captain.
Horsey.
- ls that him?
- Yes.
We've tried everything we could to wake him, without success.
Have you ever seen him before?
No, never.
Here's the letter.
He didn't want to let go of it.
From the Bavarian border, no place name, dated 1 828. . .
''His Excellency the Captain.''
''Does it say ''His Excellency''? lt does, yes!
''l'm senden yr Grace a bouye. . .''
Senden yr Grace, hah hah!
Should l take that down?
Yes, please do.
''This here bouye wants to serve his King faithfully.''
''The bouye was laid me on. . .''
He says the boy was ''laid'' him on 7th October, 1 81 2.
''l am a poor laborer with 1 0 children. . .
. . .and have enough to do to feed myself and my wife.
His mother wanted to raise the boy, but l couldn't ask her to. l didn't tell her the boy was laid on me by the Court. l have not let him take one step out of the house since 1 81 2. . .
. . .so nobody doesn't know a thing about him.
You can ask him, but he can't tell you. l teached him reading and riting. and he says he wants to be. . .
''. . .a gallant rider like his father.''
A gallant rider, yes. . .
''. . .a gallant rider like his father was before him. lf he had parents. . .
. . .he would have been a smart fellow.''
A smart fellow, yes.
''You only have to show him something and he can do it.
But please do not plie him with questions. . .''
Ply with 'ie'. . .
''He don't know where l am. . .
. . .l brought him away by night. l am not signing my name.''
No, there's no signature.
- Did you get it all down?
- Yes.
This is very odd.
Yes, indeed!
Should l report no signature?
Yes, and put this in the file. l'll try him again. . .
No, don't. Leave him be.
You can see it's no use.
He seems to be not quite all right in the head.
He's coming around. . .
Your name!
Should l report that he refuses to talk?
Yes, name unknown.
Where are you from?
And his passport?
Gallant rider. . .
Occupation?
Where were you born?
He says he comes from Regensburg.
From Regensburg.
The intelligence of this man is in a state of absolute confusion.
There's nothing to be gained by police interrogation.
Should l take that down?
Nothing to be gained by police interrogation, yes.
Refuses to answer.
He refuses to answer!
Right, and what do we do now?
Maybe he's hungry? lt's worth a try.
Lay him down again!
Spits out food!
Spat out food. . .
Let's have a look at his feet. l say, those are old boots.
Those boots have very old toes!
Bleeding of the toes, scabs. . . lndicates a long period of. . .
Feet extremely tender. . .
Both feet show same indications. . .
. . .of extreme tenderness.
Aha, vaccination marks!
The foundling seems to be of the higher orders!
Foundling, yes, get that down.
Upper arm injured. . .
What was this injury caused by?
By a blunt instrument, l'd say.
Blunt instrument, l'd say.
The same marks here, and here. . .
Put that down!
A prayer book!
Entitled ''Spiritual Forget-me-nots''.
Beautiful and Devoted
Morning Prayers for Faithful Souls.
The other book. . .
. . .a printed treatise entitled
'Six Deep and Devotional Prayers'.
Put under 'other things'. . .
A four-cornered, folded square of paper, containing. . .
. . .yes, a small quantity of gold dust, or gold leaf.
Put that with the other things.
Then a rosary. . .rosary.
A rosary with a metal cross.
With the other things.
Under the circumstances, this man should be taken into custody!
Put that down, word for word.
A pencil!
And a sheet of paper.
Can he write? Can you write?
Kaspar Hauser.
The fellow is not as wild as l thought: he came peacefully.
He seems harmless enough. l've done all l can.
The rest is up to the authorities.
Maybe we should place him under oath.
He did not impress us as being either mad or depraved.
Neither mad nor depraved. lt's best we keep him in this tower for criminals and vagabonds.
He doesn't look like going berserk.
No, but you never can tell.
He'll have to sit up to eat, he can't eat on the floor.
Julius, take his feet.
You hold him back. . . now forward. . .
Now he's on his feet!
Sit him down there.
Let's stretch his feet out. l guess he never sat up straight at a table before!
He never sat up at all in the tower.
Take the bowl away. . .
Hold on to the table there!
Come on, let go!
Give me your hat, you won't be needing it now.
Leave him be, it's all right.
Let's start.
You've got to eat, come on.
You can't eat with your hat!
He won't give it to me.
There, take the spoon. . .
. . .and start eating.
Look. . .look. . .like this.
Do it like me.
He'll be all right, it's just that he don't have no manners yet.
So, open your mouth. . .
See, l told you so!
Oh, my goodness me!
Take his bowl away, he's not used to it.
Give him bread, he always takes bread when you give it to him.
Bread. . . take the bread.
Give him a drop of water, Julius.
Look, it's empty, there's nothing more inside.
Nothing comes out any more.
- Empty!
- Empty.
Empty!
Nothing more inside.
All gone.
Empty.
Empty.
No, this jug's not empty, there's beer in it.
Look. . . it's full, it's not empty.
That cup there is empty.
There's nothing in it.
Empty. lt'll take time, getting him used to such things.
Don't cry, don't cry.
Oh my, how my gut is painin' me!
Finger, thumb, arm. . .
This is your hand, this is your arm.
Arm. . .nose. . .mouth. . .
Look, this is your ear.
Look, l've even got a mirror!
This here is your ear.
My gut is killing me.
Finger. . .shoulder. . .
. . .arm.
No, that's your hand.
This is your arm.
Hand, hand!
This is your arm.
Arm, arm, arm. . .
Hand.
Hey, what kind of place is this here, anyway?
Damn your eyes, ain't there nothin' in this place to drink?
Stand up, Kaspar, stand up!
You don't have to be ashamed, we're alone here.
Only the dear Lord is watching, don't be afraid.
Mother, my skin is coming off!
Don't worry about it.
He hasn't had a bath in years.
Lap, lap, lap, l like this milk,
Lap, lap, lap as smooth as silk.
Good morning, little cat so white.
May l sit down by your side?
Good morning, little cat so white,
May l sit down by your side?
Be nice to me little girl so fair,
Then you may sit down right there.
Lap, lap, lap l like this milk,
Lap, lap, lap as smooth as silk.
Agnes, that rhyme is too long for him.
All he knows are separate words. l just taught him separate words. . .
. . .and he can't understand your rhyme yet. lt's no use, he doesn't even respond to a feigned thrust.
Doesn't respond to feigned thrust. l don't think he's a hard boiled swindler.
He's got absolutely no conception of danger!
No conception of danger. lt didn't even scare him.
How about trial by fire?
- ls that for the record?
- Yes.
He's not afraid of the flame.
Charmed to meet you!
Charmed, l'm sure!
Look at him gapin'!
He's never seen that before.
Look, look. . .look here!
Pick up the baby,
Kaspar, go ahead.
Mother, l am so far away from everything. l eat with my handses. . .
With your hands!
With my handses.
With your hands!
Have you heard anything?
A number of people have testified that the foundling. . .
. . .ran away from a group of English circus equestrians.
- They were in the Oberpfalz area.
- What was that?
Other citizens say he is a member of the Baden dynasty. . .
. . .who was to be eliminated as most likely heir.
The Baden dynasty, however. . .
. . .is beyond all reproach.
Besides, there are better ways of getting rid of unwanted heirs. . . l don't believe the story in any case. Just look at him. . .
. . .with his coarse, rustic features!
There's nothing refined about him at all.
She can't walk on two feet!
After all, he's beginning to be a burden on the community coffers.
He's costing us a pretty penny.
Perhaps he should begin contributing to his own upkeep somehow.
One could turn the public interest in him to good use.
Come right on up, ladies and gentlemen!
Parents keep an eye on their children!
Now before we present the Four Riddles of the Spheres. . .
. . .we have for you an entertaining intermezzo.
This wild bear, Kublai Khan, from farthest central Asia. . .
. . .came to us somewhere in Mongolia, where the Huns live.
With one sweep of his mighty paw he can kill a bull!
But here in the temperate zones, dear children. . .
. . .he is as tame and cuddly as a little cat.
Here our lndian fire-eater, our fakir. . .
. . .a living flame, a veritable mountain of fire!
He has succeeded, ladies and gentlemen, by will power alone. . .
. . .in rejecting every trace of a burn or scorch!
Show us your skin, soft as a baby's, not a blemish.
What's this, you scoundrel?
And now. . .
. . .ladies and gentlemen. . .
. . .for the very first time in the history of the world.
Brought together for you and only for the first time:
The Four Riddles of the Spheres!
Minors please keep their distance.
The gravity of my presentation permits of no childish pranks.
And now for the first Riddle:
The Little King!
Monarch of the Golden Land of Punt of song and legend.
The last link of an ancient line of giants!
Each king of this line was tinier than the last.
Here you see that the last living member of the royal family.
Another few centuries, and the
Kings of Punt will be invisible.
The very last king will be no bigger than a flea!
Yes, there he sits, our Little King. . .
. . .cowering like an outcast in the corner of his throne.
And as the kings have grown tinier, so have their kingdoms.
His kingdom is no larger than the spot he is sitting on. . .
. . .for neither can he leave his kingdom without outside help. . .
. . .nor can he climb it. Our next Riddle, ladies and gentlemen. . .
Our next Riddle of Science - the Young Mozart!
One day long ago he fell into a deep trance. . .
. . .and asked for nothing more but the music of Mozart.
At a tender age he already knew all the scores by heart.
Now, still in the trance, he looks for dark holes in the earth. . .
. . .because they tried to teach him to read and write at school.
Since that day he has lost the power of speech.
He was not able to read or write he says. . .
. . .because the whiteness of the paper blinded him.
Day in, day out, he peers into dark, deep holes in the earth. . .
. . .looking for entrances to caves and underground waterways.
As you see, there is no way to gain the poor fellow's attention. . .
His mind is completely engrossed in zones of twilight.
Our next Riddle, a living specimen of anthropology. . .
. . .is Hombrecito.
An untamed lndian from the sunny shores of New Spain.
This wildman is the sole remaining member in all of Europe. . .
. . .of the renowned and legendary Kaffir and lndian Show.
He plays his wooden flute night and day, because he believes. . .
. . .that if he stops, all the people in town will die.
He wears three separate jackets to keep from catching cold. . .
. . .and to protect himself from the evil breath of mankind.
Hombrecito is a jolly good fellow, and quite tame.
He speaks hardly a word of any tongue - except lndian of course.
And now to the final and greatest Riddle of all!
Kaspar, the Foundling!
He has agreed, with the express permission of the authorities. . .
. . .to appear in person here every afternoon, and thus..
. . .to ease the community's financial burden.
Thank you, Kaspar!
Kaspar Hauser was found in the Town Square of this fine city. . .
. . .just as you see him standing before you today. ln his right hand, a prayer-book. . .
. . .and his left, the Anonymous Letter.
Abandoned to his fate in a strange town. . .
. . .the boy could neither speak nor walk.
He had never seen a living being in his life before!
His origin remains in darkness to this day, ladies and gentlemen. ls he a prince? Or possibly the legitimate son of Napoleon?
His is and will remain the
Riddle of the European Continent!
Stop, Hombrecito!
Kaspar, come back! Are you mad? l will get you!
Stop in the name of the Law!
There he is!
Come down from there!
Stop shaking that branch! lf that branch breaks, l'll. . . !
Come down here!
Keep searching for Kasper.
The beehive! Ah, it's locked.
He couldn't be in there. l want to fly like a rider. . .
. . .midst the bloody tussle of war!
What a fine, what a beautiful report this will make! l shall write a report the likes of which has never been seen!
Kaspar, what's wrong?
Are you feeling well? lt feels strong in my heart.
The music feels strong in my heart. l feel so unexpectedly old.
You've been such a short time in the world, Kaspar.
Why is everything so hard for me?
Why can't l play the piano like l can breathe? ln the two short years you have been here with me. . .
. . .you have learned so much!
The people here want to help you make up for lost time.
The people are like wolves to me!
No, you mustn't say that.
Look at Florian, he lives here too.
He lost his family in a fire, he is blind, but does he complain?
No, he plays the piano the whole day long. . .
. . .even though his music sounds a little strange.
Oh, how it is!
A very big man must have built it. l would like to meet him.
A man doesn't have to be as tall as the tower he builds.
He can use a scaffold! l'll take you to see a new building.
You lived in this tower, where that little window is.
That cannot be!
Because the room is only a few steps big. l don't understand.
Wherever l look in the room. . .
. . .to the right, to the left. . .
. . .frontwards and backwards - there's only room.
But when l look on the tower. . .
At the tower!
. . .and l turn around, the tower is gone!
So, the room is bigger than the tower!
No, Kaspar, that's not right.
Think about it a little more. l still don't understand.
How do you mean that?
Yes, let's ask him. lt's important.
Another cup of coffee, Pastor.
Yes, please, it's excellent!
Another cup of coffee?
Yes, please.
You're not going to torture him much longer, are you? l wouldn't call it torture!
- l'll leave the pot here.
- Thanks.
Kaspar, what we really want to know is. .
. . .whether a Higher Being didn't occupy your thoughts in prison. l don't understand the question. ln my prison l didn't think of anything. . .
. . .and l cannot imagine. . .
. . .that God created everything out of nothing. . .
. . .like you say! lf he doesn't understand God, then he'll simply have to have faith!
You must have faith! The tenets of faith transcend mortal doubt.
First l have to learn to read and write better to understand.
No, Kaspar, the articles of faith are more important. . .
And do stop pressing your thumb and finger when you speak!
And now, my son, please repeat this prayer after me.
Repeat after me!
For the peace of God is higher than all mortal coils. . .
Keep our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
Please, repeat.
Say it!
Look, these are last years apples.
Big and red, aren't they?
And those apples on the tree will look just the same soon.
How do they do that?
Time does it, Kaspar.
And the Lord's plan!
Let the apples lie, they're tired and want to sleep.
Kaspar, an apple can't be tired.
Apples don't have lives of their own - they follow our will. l'm going to roll one down the path, it'll stop where l want it to.
The apple didn't stop, it hid in the grass!
May l have your help in demonstrating it to him Mr. Fuhrmann?
Come here, Kaspar, watch!
Stand here where you can see.
Now, Mr. Fuhrmann is going to put out his foot. . .
. . .and when l roll the apple, it will stop right where we want it to.
Smart apple! lt jumped over his foot and ran away!
Smart apple!
What are women good for?
Can you tell me that, Katy?
Women are not good for anything but sitting still!
But Kaspar. . .
Why are women allowed only to knit and cook?
You'll have to ask
Mr. Daumer that, Kaspar.
He'll know a decent answer for you. l already asked Mr. Daumer.
Yes, Mr. Daumer is an educated man. l will never learn as much as him.
He told me about the Sahara Desert. . .
. . .and l can't get it out of my head!
Katy, have you been to the Sahara Desert? l'm just a housekeeper, l don't go journeying so much. l was in Erlangen once, but it's a long way from there to the desert! l know a story about the desert, but only the beginning.
Yes, Mr. Daumer told me about it.
He said you couldn't get past the beginning of your story. . .
. . .and that you should wait to tell it until you know the end. . .
. . .and not just the beginning.
Yes, he takes it seriously, that you should learn to tell a story right. lf l . . .can ask. . .
. . .Mister Daumer. . .
. . .to read. . .
. . .this letter. . .
. . .at his pleasure.
A few days ago l took some cress seeds. . .
. . .and sowed my name with them.
And it came up right pretty.
And it made me so happy that l can hardly say.
And yesterday, when l came back from boating. . .
. .somebody had come into the garden. .
. . .and stepped on my name. l cried for a long time. l am going to sow the name again. lt dreamed to me. . .
You had a dream? Tell it to me!
Yes, it dreamed to me.
You're really coming along, Kaspar.
You used to think all your dreams were real.
Just a fortnight ago, you said you saw the mayor's wife. . .
. . .even though everybody knows she'd gone on a journey.
Strange that you didn't dream once during your years in prison! l dreamed of the Caucasus. lt just can't be true when you say. . .
. . .that your bed is the only place in the world you're really happy in.
Don't you like the garden?
The gooseberry bushes?
Or the onions over there?
All so green?
Well, it seems to me. . .
. . .that my coming into this world. . .
. . .was a terribly hard fall!
But Kaspar! That. . .
No, that's not. . .
How should l explain it to you?
The Professor here has come all this way to ask you a question.
He wants to see how well you can think. . .
. . .and what you have learned in these two years. . .
. . .and whether you can think logically. Will you answer him?
- Yes!
- Good.
Kaspar. . .
. . .let's pretend that this is a village. ln this village live people who tell only the truth.
Here is another village.
The people here only tell lies.
Two paths run from these villages to where you are standing. . .
. . .and you are at the crossroads.
A man comes along, and you want to know which village he comes from. . .
. . .the village of the truthtellers or the village of the liars.
Now in order to solve this problem, to solve it logically. . .
. . .you have one question, and only one.
What is the question?
That's too difficult for him, how can he know that. l admit, the question is thorny. lf you ask the man whether he comes from the village of truth. . .
. . .and he does, then he will say, truthfully, yes.
But if he comes from the village of lies, he will lie. . .
. . .and also answer yes!
Yet there exists one question which will solve the problem.
That's much to hard, too complicated.
You have one question, Kaspar. . .
. . .and only one, to solve this problem of logic. l wouldn't know either. lf you can't think of the question. . .
. . .then l shall tell you. lf you came from the other village. . .
. . .would you answer 'no' if l were to ask you whether. . .
. . .you came from the liars' village?
By means of a double negative the liar is forced to tell the truth.
This construction forces him to reveal his identity, you see.
That's what l call logic via argument to the truth!
Well, l know another question.
You do?
There is no other question, by the laws of logic.
There isn't?
But l do know another question.
Let us hear it, then! l should ask the man whether he was a tree-frog.
The man from the truth village would say:
No, l'm not a tree-frog, because he tells the truth.
The man from the liars' village would say:
Yes, l'm a tree-frog, because he would tell a lie.
So l know where he comes from.
No, that's not a proper question.
That won't do, l can't accept it as a question.
That's no logic; logic is deduction, not description.
What you've done is describe something, not deduce it.
But l understood his question.
Understanding is secondary; the reasoning is the thing. ln Logic and Mathematics we do not understand things. . .
. . .we reason and deduce: l cannot accept that question.

With gratitude we record the
Guardianship Council's petition. . .
. . .to all men of generous heart. . .
. . .to ease the lot of the poor and destitute among us.
Flowers will also be accepted.
No, Katy dear, my eyes aren't what they used to be.
Would you be so kind as to call on the tailor today?
Kaspar will be needing his new coat tomorrow.
How far along are you with your new biography, Kaspar?
The word is out that you are working on it, and. . .
. . .everybody l know is dying to read it.
No, l don't want to let go of any of it yet.
There are so many words l don't know. . .
. . .and so many things l don't understand yet.
Sorry to disturb you, but l just wanted to tell you. . .
. . .that an English nobleman, Count
Stanhope, has come to town.
He has taken great interest in your situation, and said. . .
. . .that he would like to adopt you if you made a good impression. lt would be a wonderful new start for you, Kaspar. l am overwhelmed.
Welcome!
Thank you. l should like to introduce my young protege. . .
Kaspar, this is our charming hostess.
Don't be afraid, give the lady your hand.
And this is our gracious host. . .
. . .who will open the doors of society to you.
Allow me to introduce my young protege to you. lsn't he droll!
Quite the noble savage! l should like you to meet the mayor and his wife.
Hello, Kaspar. l'm so happy to meet you, Kaspar.
Tell me, what was it like in that dark cellar of yours.
Better than outside!
But we all like you so much, Kaspar.
Were you about to say something?
You just tell us whatever comes into your natural young head.
Your Grace, nothing lives in me except my life!
Oh no, there's much more alive inside of you.
You've been making such fine progress with your music. . .
. . .something that educates and ennobles our feelings!
Your Grace, l would like to play a piece on the piano. l shall play Mozart's waltz in F major. l'm not feeling well, may l be excused?
A little fresh air will help. l'll open the window a bit.
Are you feeling better, Kaspar? l think it's better we left him alone for a moment.
There's no cause for concern.
Kaspar is feeling a bit faint.
Perhaps in the meantime l can tell you of my visit to Greece.
Not many days ago the sun of Hellas shone down on me. l loitered, Pindar in hand, neath the columns of Corinth.
The sunrises were indescribable. . .
. . .the crystal clarity of the
Greek light unforgettable.
A balm to the soul, that unsullied atmosphere! l continued onto Crete, where l rode the little donkeys. . .
The backs of these animals are often quite hard, you know. . .
. . .and l was forced to wear peasants' trousers!
Then the festivals of the simple peasants of the countryside. . .
. . .the charming dances. . .
Excuse me please, my protege.
What's the meaning of this, Kaspar? l'm sure l don't understand. . .
And what manner of silly business is this?
Apparently l've been guilty of a misjudgment.
There hasn't been enough time. . .
. . .for me to get a true picture of the circumstances.
Why did you leave the church?
The singing of the congregation. . .
. . .sounds to me like awful howling.
And then the singing stops, the pastor starts to howl.
Kaspar, we have to go back in.
Poor young fellow!
He must have taken too much of that laxative the doctor gave him!
- Katy!
- Yes.
Come here a moment. lt looks like a bloody handprint.
Mercy me! l saw him go in here this morning. . .
. . .and the door wasn't off its hinges. Look - it's blood!
There are bloodstains on the cellar door.
He can't have broken in by himself. . .
He's drunk it dry!
Now he's bitten a piece out of the bowl!
Ah, here's our patient.
Hello, thank you.
Did you apply the bandage?
There wasn't time to do it better.
Were there any other injuries beside the head wound?
No, only his head. l have a few important questions to ask the victim.
Please - not now.
Well, we won't be getting anything out of him today!
But at least he's not talking the kind of rot he did last week.
All the same, with respect to the crime. . .
. . .and Hauser's origins, we can't expect much from him today.
Then l shall ask you to take your leave, gentlemen.
There was one thing. . .
. . .l wanted to mention.
But it has nothing to do with the attack on me. lt is all so clear before my eyes.
Tell us, Kaspar. l saw the ocean, and l saw a mountain. . .
. . .and there were many people climbing up the mountain. lt was like a procession.
There was a lot of fog. l couldn't see it very clearly, but. . .
. . .at the very top was Death.
What's happened?
He's been stabbed!
What happened? And where?
The man told me to watch the gardener. . .
. . .then he gave me this pouch and stabbed me. l'll take you home, we'll carry you.
Let me see what's in the pouch.
A note!
''Hauser can tell you exactly what l look like. . .
. . .and where l come from.
To save him the trouble. . .
. . .l'll tell you myself where l come from. . .
. . .and even what my name is.
. . .M. L.O.''
The Lord have mercy on me for l am weak.
Heal me Lord, for my limbs are stricken.
Lord, why do you hide from me in my hour of need?
Do not go far from me, for fear is near. l am weary of sighing. l lie in the sweat of my body. . .
. . .and my tears moisten my bed.
My body, weakened by mourning, has grown old. . .
. . .and l am tormented from every side.
Away from me, evil-doers, for the Lord hears my call.
Kaspar, my son. . .
. . .if anything is burdening you, please tell us now.
Yes. . .
There is something, a story. . . lt's about a caravan. . .
. . .and the desert.
But l know only the beginning.
That doesn't matter now.
Tell us the story, even if it's only the beginning. l see a caravan. . .
. . .coming through the desert. . .
. . .across the sands.
And this caravan. . .
. . .is led by an old Berber tribes man.
And this old man is blind.
Now the caravan stops. . .
. . .because some believe they are lost. . .
. . .and because they see mountains ahead of them.
They look at their compass, but it's no use.
Then their blind leader picks up a handful of sand. . .
. . .and tastes it, as though it were food.
My sons, the blind man says, you are wrong.
Those are not mountains you see. . .
. . .it is only your imagination.
We must continue northward.
And they follow the old man's advice. . .
. . .and finally reach the City in the North.
And that's where the story begins.
But how the story goes after they reach the city, l don't know.
Thank you all for listening to me. l'm tired now.
There we have it - the left lobe of the liver is greatly enlarged.
That is an unusual finding indeed, and worth recording.
Please take this down:
Left liver lobe enlarged and extends. . .
. . .enlarged, yes.
. . .and extends to below the left arch of the diaphragm.
Doctor, look!
. . .arch of the diaphragm.
Look at the brain, its shape is rather unusual.
Yes, a remarkable abnormality.
Overdevelopment of the cerebrum.
Oh, l agree, yes!
There is also a deformity of the cerebrum.
The left hemisphere is too small.
That explains a great deal!
This should be recorded.
Take this down:
Abnormal cerebrum. . .
. . .definitely overdeveloped.
Deformity of left cerebral hemisphere. . .
. . .which does not sufficiently cover the cerebellum.
Coachman!
Today is a day to remember.
Be so good as to take my hat home with you. l'm going to walk home.
What a wonderful, what a precise report this will make!
Deformities discovered in
Kaspar Hauser's brain and liver!
Finally we have got an explanation for this strange man. . .
. . .and no one would never find nothing like this.
I don't want to be a girl anymore.
I've come to tuck you in.
What is it?
I'm heavy.
You get on top.
Hold me here.
Like this.
You're pressing me.
Let me come up a bit more.
Put your hand here.
I'll hold you here.
Is that right?
Here?
I'll move my leg a little.
Yesterday was all my fault.
Please don't be mad at me.
Even if you are mad at me,
I still like you.
Duanwu.
You may go.
Sir, this is a note for you from Ruyi.
How is Master doing today?
He's doing well.
Did he eat all his food?
Will he sleep here tonight?
So here's where the Pang men had their fun, eh?
Zhongliang.
Not like that.
Hold me here.
I'll hold you there.
- You're heavy. I'll get on top.
- Be quiet!
I know what to do.
I've practiced with Duanwu for you.
Zhongliang!
Don't you want me?
I have to leave here.
I don't want to stay either.
Take me with you.
If I can't take you to Peking...
I won't take you anywhere.
Let me look at you.
I want to look at you.
Boss misses you.
He keeps asking after you.
He wants a report.
Tell Boss...
I'll be back in Shanghai in 3 days.
Tomorrow morning we leave for Peking.
So, you're off?
Early tomorrow.
Zhongliang.
I know you don't want me along.
But you owe it to me!
I can't go on like this.
I've been so lonely here... these ten years...
Looking into that face every day.
I know.
But I have to leave you.
I can't bear to watch you suffer!
So take me!
Take me so I won't suffer!
I can't take you.
You'll always remind me of this place.
And I'll never forget...
- What happened.
- And me?
After it happened...
I smuggled you out of here... but I stayed behind, with no thought for myself.
Ten years and you never once wrote. I nearly went mad!
Who could I turn to?
Now you're back and in love with that witch.
You won't even let me... cy on your shoulder.
Zhongliang.
What you did ruined my life.
Me, the one person in the world who really loves you.
You've destroyed me!
Come with me! Take a look!
This is my life!
One male fish. One female.
Ten years with two fish!
Brother.
Come give sister a kiss.
Take care, sister.
Duanwu!
Pang An.
Pang An?
Pang An!
Ruyi's run off with my brother!
Pang An!
Pang An!
Pang An.
Pang An!
I've lost Zhongliang!
He told me to wait, then he disappeared!
I can't find him anywhere!
Duanwu!
Zhongliang!
You traitor!
Did you think you'd be Master if Ruyi left?
What will you try next?
Beat the traitor!
Beat this bastard!
We'll make a man of you yet!
This will teach you!
Wonder if Zhongliang's in Peking yet.
- Zhongliang's here.
- What's he doing?
- He's in the dance hall. Okay.
- Watch him.
Boss wants to see you.
You're back.
Come here.
Have a drink.
Boss.
I've done you wrong.
Welcome back to Shanghai.
You belong here.
It's not the same without you.
Boss...
I lied to you.
The woman on Heavenly Lane... her husband's been back a long time.
I'll do the job!
I'll do it tomorrow!
I lied to you! I lied!
Zhongliang.
- It's all right.
- I lied to you!
I should never have sent
Zhongliang to the Pangs.
It was my mistake.
There's plenty of money in the world... but only one Zhongliang.
I need him.
Zhongliang's a son to you.
When he cried that night... and promised to do the Heavenly Lane job...
I knew he'd finally come around.
No, he cried because his heart was divided.
This worries me.
How shall I put it?
When an immortal descends to Earth... how can he return to the sky?
We have to get... this Heavenly Lane business right.
Let's let the Pang girl... see for herself what
Zhongliang's really like.
She'll fall right out of love.
Then he'll be able to move on.
- Boss.
- Know what to do?
Go to Ruyi, say Zhongliang sent me to take her to Peking.
Instead, bring her to Shanghai... and take her home when it's over.
Boss doesn't want the Pangs' fortune.
Boss only wants Zhongliang.
Miss Pang.
I'm going to make a phone call. Wait here.
This is Shanghai!
Good. Settle them in first.
Bye.
We'll finish the Heavenly Lane job tomorrow.
County boy!
Come have fun!
- Fuck off.
- Mind your own business.
Come on, Miss Pang.
Come in.
You're right.
You're in Shanghai, not Peking.
Zhongliang's here in Shanghai too.
Tomorrow morning at 6:00...
I'll take you to see him.
I'm going to see him tomorrow.
These are Zhongliang's... classmates.
Isn't he here?
I've missed you so much.
Don't.
I want to look at you.
Go ahead.
I've wronged you.
I'm so sorry!
Zhongliang!
Quiet.
Don't make a sound.
- Zhongliang!
- He's dead.
Mrs. Shen, will you call your husband or shall I?
Phone him? Why?
Why? To ask him over.
We'll all have a friendly chat.
But maybe you, me and
Zhongliang can manage on our own?
Zhongliang?
That's right.
He's one of us.
Well, Mrs. Shen?
What? Are you crazy?
I'll make the call!
Zhongliang.
I don't care about what's happened today.
I just want to know... did you ever love me?
Talk to me!
Tell her. Speak.
Come on!
Say something!
Did you ever love me?
I see.
Ah San!
Let's get out of here!
HEAVENLY LANE
Police taken care of?
All done.
My poor Zhongliang.
He's ruined.
Go away!
Give me back my Zhongliang.
I want the old Zhongliang back!
Little sister, can I find you a customer?
You could start tonight.
Try it!
- Get your kicks, make some money.
Stop acting like a saint. You're no better than the rest of us.
I got lost.
Those women chased me.
In Shanghai... men and women are at war.
One side will win, the other will lose.
Some women would die for their man.
Like the one who jumped.
She lost the war.
She lost.
I don't want to lose.
Are you listening?
Tomorrow I'm going to see Zhongliang.
Did you love her?
What's it to you?
You came to Shanghai to ask that?
You put on Western clothes and you act up!
Know what I am?
Or how many women I've had?
I use and betray them!
I grind them into the dirt!
But still... they want me.
They kneel before me.
They cy for me, smile for me!
Did you love her?
I'm not a servant anymore.
We men rule in Shanghai!
Well put.
Miss Pang... are you still in love with him now?
If you'd like a few more days in Shanghai...
I'm at your service.
Tell me when you want to go.
Zhongliang... whoever you are...
I don't mind.
Do you love me?
Tell me. Tell me.
Duanwu!
- Duanwu.
- Sister-in-law.
You're back.
Did you see my brother?
Duanwu.
Duanwu!
I shouldn't tell you how he makes his living. young master Jing is here.
Master Jing?
The one whose family broke the engagement with you.
Why's he here?
He didn't say.
He's been waiting for days.
Here he is.
Come, young master Jing. Please.
Young miss is back.
This is young master Jing.
Your father broke our engagement.
Yes, but he never consulted me.
Not about the betrothal, nor its cancellation.
When I was in Japan I decided...
I would meet you myself.
How else would I know what you were like?
I smoke opium.
I'm poison.
Doesn't that bother you?
I work for myself in Shanghai.
And I can choose the kind of wife I want.
Zhongliang is ruined.
Little brother.
Zhongliang,
I know about Shanghai.
It's all my fault! It is!
But Ruyi can't save you!
Don't go after her!
Who sacrificed everything to save you?
Me! Remember? Your sister!
No, this can't be true.
I know you're angry with me.
You're not marrying for love... but out of spite.
In your heart... it's me you really want.
Let's go to Peking.
This time I mean it.
I don't love you.
Come with me to Peking!
I don't love you anymore.
Why did you come to the club?
If you hadn't...
I wouldn't be here now.
I went to ask you something.
You refused to answer me... same as that other woman.
You wouldn't answer me... but now I understand.
You can't answer.
You're afraid.
Your heart is dead.
You cannot love.
I love you!
It's too late.
I love you.
It's too late now.
In a few days...
I'll be a bride.
I've always wanted to get married.
I've been waiting... waiting.
My bridal costume's nearly finished.
And I've chosen my husband.
I can do whatever I want... and this is what I want.
I'm going to Shanghai.
I'll be back in three days.
I've prepared your bags, sir.
But I have something to tell you.
The young miss has slept with... both me and Zhongliang.
What he says is true.
Here.
I just poisoned your husband.
I put arsenic in his opium.
I'll say good-bye now.
I'm really going to Peking this time.
I don't know why... but I often think of that evening I first came here... and how the moon was so bright.
We were all so young then.
You ran barefoot... in the Ancestral Hall and I saw you outside... with Duanwu.
If only we didn't have to grow up... it would be perfect.
I always prepared
Zhengda's opium.
I've prepared this opium for you.
Here.
Good-bye, Zhongliang.
Elder sister... shall I help you?
Zhongliang prepared it.
I'll do it myself.
This will be the last time.
I'm giving it up after the wedding.
Zhongliang!
From now on, Duanwu is the official head of the household.
The young master Zhengda approves!
He is too ill to be here.
But Miss Ruyi ought to be present.
If anyone does not know this place:
It is the Kingdom of Ling, the centre of the world.
If anyone does not know me:
I am Ma Nene Karmo.
I live in the blue turquoise palace in the divine paradise.
You appeared in this world where there is so much sorrow and hate.
The people hunt the animals.
They kill and eat them.
The people catch the fish with iron hooks.
When you destroyyour enemies, the gods and Padmasambhava take them to the Kingdom of Heaven.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, always feel compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
Brahma also always feels compassion for living creatures and never hate for them.
You have to subjugate the 1 8 kingdoms ofthe demons and all their other domains
Collect the treasures for Ling and spread the teachings of Buddha.
You must go to the underworld.
When you get there, beware of the boar-headed and the dog-headed spirits.
Furthermore, you will also find the cold hell and the hot hell there.
There, too, is a bottomless river.
Onlyyou and your horse can cross this river.
Midshung, Drugmo and Pekar Lhatse are personifications of the goddess Tara.
They appear in the world to save the living creatures.
I, Ma Nene Karmo, work in the upperworld of the gods, in the middle world of Ngen, in the lower world of the water spirits.
I work forthem all and do not remain idle.
You, too, must be active.
Do not stay here long.
Go to the underworld to save the living creatures.
You must pass judgement on what is good and what is bad.
Follow the white light and go to the underworld.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
In this way Ma Nene Karmo sang about the work of Drugmo in theworld, about King Gesar's descent into hell and about his horse.
From the victorious golden throne
King Gesar, the heavenly ruler, the earth's tree of life, looked upon the assembly with loving and watchful eyes.
All the fathers and mothers, sons and daughters of Ling offered their adoration and good wishes to the King.
Theyjoyfully sang old songs and performed propitious dances.
They drank tea and barley beer in a festive mood.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
Is the 24th a Friday?.
It is a Friday!.
All right then.
On that daywe bring burnt offerings.
Yes, burnt offerings and prayers.
Margen, is Monday your neutral day?.
Yes.
Is Monday a good day?.
Yes, it is a lucky as well as a neutral day.
Then let's set out on Monday!.
It's the right time ifit's a neutral day.
A neutral day is good!
Yes, it is.
Leave on Monday and celebrate the preparation feast on Friday?.
Yes, dear, that's what we'll do.
Friday is Margen's most favourable day.
And the element water is available twice over.
It is an excellent day for the preparation.
Yes, my dear.
Let us also play equestrian games, so that all the lucky signs agree.
Zopon's horse will have to show what it can do.
That remains to be seen!
Kiang or these two horses will win!
Kiang must do his best; ifhe loses, he's lost his chance!
Ifhe loses, he is finished.
But we are betting on him.
...Nextyear at this same time, maywe all bejoyfully reunited.
Maythere be peace in theworld.
May all beings know of Buddha's teachings.
May all the tutelary gods protect us.
May H.H. the Dalai Lama live long and maywe soon meet him...
This is our salt.
That's what our 4 men are going to bring from Lake Tsentso this year.
I don't know ifwe'll find salt there.
They say there are many salt lakes.
Lorries collect the salt mostly from other lakes, butyak caravans go to Lake Tsentso.
Whoever has been to Lake Tsentso will go there again.
We exchange salt for grain.
This year the price of salt is very low.
So we have to keep it for the time being.
Ifthe price goes up, it's good for us.
Ifit stays low, we can't do anything.
It isn't easy to keepyaks.
Fetching salt with yaks is hard work, and then the price for the salt in no way pays us for our effort.
When the salt was worth more, we would exchange it for barley.
But nowadays the value has gone down.
So we have to sell ouryaks to get barley.
Without salt we nomads have no barley either.
Is the Gomshe family sending fouryaks?.
No, threeyaks.
Then we have a total of 1 60 yaks,
40 yaks per man?.
-Three from you?.
-Yes, three.
And 21, that makes 1 60 yaks altogether!
Who is the sheep from?.
It's from Margen.
Margen - The Old Mother
I have a lot of experience because I've been fetching salt for manyyears.
So I can show the others the way and explain to them how it's done.
And besides, I'm the oldest.
Ifwe're in a hurry,
I quickly make some simple tea.
But ifwe have time,
I make real strong butter tea and we have a rest.
That's Margen's work.
I was Margen for manyyears, and they all want me as Margen again.
Margen wishes you all good luck!
Thank you for your wishes, all the best!
Pargen - The Old Father
Is it already 4 o'clock?.
Ifit's alreadyfour, we can gradually start the horse racing.
Yes, we'll soon go outside.
Pargen's best wishes for all of you!
We thankyou foryourwishes. Good luck!
Bopsa is the favourite son ofthe salt men, so they say anyway.
Ah yes.
The favourite son??!.
Oyes, each one of us has a position.
Yes, you each have your position.
One is the Old Mother, one the Old Father and one is Lord of the Animals and one the novice!
Zopon - The Lord of the Animals
The Lord of the Animals wishes good luck!
Thankyou.
Long life and success!
Dear Bopsa, have another!
You're like our only son.
Bopsa - The Novice
Bopsa wishes you all good luck!
Yes, thankyou!
Bopsa's nose quivers when he drinks!
They say that in the olden days a woman once went to the salt lake to get salt.
She was so greedy that she took an awful lot of salt and stuffed it all into her trousers.
That upset the salt lake and made it angry.
Since then women are no longer allowed to go to the salt lake.
That's what people say.
There is a salt language.
But the salt men say that they aren't allowed to use this language in the presence of women.
Women don't go to the salt lake, they aren't allowed to.
I don't know why.
In all my more than 70 years I have never heard ofa woman fetching salt.
There must be some reason for it.
Women don't even turn their faces in that direction.
When my son goes to the salt lake as Lord ofthe Animals I worry a bit about him catching a cold and about other small things.
Otherwise I'm notworried because he really is strong enough and can go on the journey.
People say ifa woman goes to the salt lake the salt disappears, women don't get it.
The reason for this may be because women are different from birth, they are different from men.
The first time I was Bopsa it wasn't very difficult because I had an older man at my side.
That time we went to Lake Biru.
Later on we nearly always went to Tsentso, where my grandson goes now. But there we usually had trouble because ofthe mud.
With the heavy salt sacks on our backs we often sank deep into the muddy ground.
It was hard work.
I and Derma, we fight as equals for the Kingdom Ling.
This has been determined by the gods.
We must ride toJang and take possession of the twelve precious salt lakes.
It is time now to conquer the eighty demonic warriors ofJang.
Margen means that I prepare tea and other things for all of us, as a mother does for her family.
Pargen stands for father.
Pargen and Margen take on the roles offather and mother.
Pargen's jobs are to make burnt offerings, to distribute the meat, to prepare the dumpling soup, and if something has to be discussed, to go to other tents.
There is an old story about the different kinds ofwood:
One day the woods spoke to each other about having to go into the fire ofthe salt men the next day.
All the woods said:
I don't want to go,
I don't want to,
I don't want to go!
But then one wood called Wodu came forward and said:
I shall go by hiding myself under the ground.
Wodu wood is yellowish and only grows under the ground.
When it rains it is difficult to find dung to make a firewith.
But luckily it hardly ever rains at this time of the year.
The journey to Tsentso takes a month and a day or two more.
Ifwewalkfast, it takes just a month.
In the past we used to meet other people almost every day, but nowadays far fewer people live here.
Many days we don't meet even a single soul.
There used to be many tents and many herds.
We even had the problem ofthe animals getting mixed up, so that we kept having to look for them.
Once we get beyond the 'stone goat' behind the pass, we have to start following the rules.
They must be obeyed as from this point.
Even when we are sitting in the tent, each one of us has to take up the right position.
And we are by no means allowed to use bad words.
After passing the "stone goat" we also speak the salt language.
Whateverwe do now, we must obey the rules.
It's the first time for Bopsa.
He's a novice here and is initiated into it like a monk who is entering a monastery.
That's why he also brings us butter and tea as presents.
Everything is new to Bopsa, so we older ones have to show him everything for him to learn.
Today is the day that he is admitted to our community.
As from the Bopsa ceremony he will really belong to the salt men.
We call him Bopsa because there are many things he still can't do.
Whatever he does, he lacks experience.
Nothing works without experience,
Iike this he won't achieve anything.
At the salt lake he has to learn how to extract salt, how deep you're allowed to scrape, how to handle the tools, all kinds oftricks.
And how to carry the sacks, but here it depends on whether he is strong enough.
May the gods be with us on the way there and receive us on the way back.
Hail to the gods and the water spirits.
Protect us from all evil!
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods, enemyvanquishers, local gods, the lord ofthe area and all his servants, may they all come and accept the burnt offerings and ablutions.
The gods ofwisdom, the gods ofactivity, the gods of magic power, the Lamas and Tantrics, the earthly tutelary deities, the wish-fulfilling gods ofthe treasure,
Jambhala with all his servants, maythey all accept the offering and make riches fall upon us like rain.
Whereveryou gods appear, may mywishes be fulfilled, obstacles be overcome, illnesses be cured and all negative influences be kept away from me.
May the banners ofbliss rise in all ten directions.
May the lords of the areas, the water spirits, the Ngen, the gods ofthe country, the local gods with their servants, who live in all worlds and in this place, appear and accept the offering.
May the Lamas ofthe three bodies, the Lamas of the three traditions, the peaceful and wrathful deities, the three jewels, the sacrificial goddesses, the gods and guardians of the treasure and all higher creatures accept the pure alcohol offering and fulfil mywishes.
The Earth, the flowers and plants on it, the four continents and Mount Meru, adorned with the sun and the moon,
I shall take them to Buddha as an offering.
May all living creatures be reincarnated in the perfect world.
Good fortune and blessing!
May all you do be successful!
With other salt men we speak only the salt language.
If e.g. at the salt lake someone from our tent meets someone from the neighbouring tent, they speak the salt language.
Anyone who can't speak the salt language isn't respected, especially ifit is an older man.
One thinks badly of someone like that.
The salt language is the salt men's secret language.
When we meet non-nomads we don't use a single word of it.
And especially when women are there we keep the salt language absolutely secret.
We've got that from our forefathers.
That's all I know.
The caravan consists of two parts.
We call the front one Bobyak.
It goes on ahead with the luggage and takes it to the next camp.
The remaining yaks are led by the Lord ofthe Animals to good pastures where he lets them graze in peace.
Where there isn't good grass, he makes them walk faster.
The Bobyak has to be exchanged every day because some ofthese yaks get weak from carrying loads.
That's whywe exchange them and let the others do the carrying.
Where there is good grass
I let the animals walk slowly, and where there is little grass
I drive them a bit.
While the other men go on ahead to the next camp,
I look after the animals.
I make myself some tea, that's all.
In the evening I try to reach the camp with the animals.
At the salt lake, when the others have finished preparing the salt, they send me a message to bring theyaks.
As soon as I get there
I check the saddles and yak carpets.
That's myjob as Zopon, as Lord ofthe Animals.
Doyou live down there?.
Yes, I live down there.
Down there?.
Yes, there.
-You're called Kunga?.
-Yes.
-Would you like some snuff?.
-No.
Was there a lot of snow here this year?.
Not so much,just a little.
But it snowed more back there?.
Yes, there was more snow there.
Was there less here than lastyear?.
Yes. Normallywe have to move...
Doyou?.
...so the animals can survive.
In that case the grass must be better than lastyear?.
Yes, there's more grass here this year.
So that's whyyou didn't move!
This yak has been ill since last night.
It has a twisting ofthe intestines.
It hasn't been well for a few days.
We need somebodywho knows something about this illness.
I don't know how to go about it.
When there isn't enough grass, the animals eat sand.
That's why this has happened.
There's no good grass here.
The other three have gone to look for theyak herd.
But they still aren't backyet, they've been a long time.
We have to find somebody who can help us with theyak!
I'm afraid it will die.
It has to have an operation!
Ifwe have it operated on,
I hope it will survive!
What are we to do with this poor little yak?.
-How are you?.
-Fine.
So we meet after all.
Pardon?.
I thought you wouldn't go to Lake Tsentso this year.
I'm away a lot these days.
Yes.
Yes, then...
You look younger every year.
-Really!?.
-Yes, you do.
Myyaks called Drawu, Rokpu,
Jawu, Zagur, Bandung...
I have lost them all and still haven't found them.
They disappeared in December, still no trace ofthem.
If there really is salt in LakeTsentso, that's good for us.
That's good for you people.
But we can't fetch the salt
Iike the lorries do.
And who knows how deep the mud is?.
It's better than it used to be.
I hope so.
What am I to do?.
I think it's better if the yak has an operation now that we're here at the doctor's.
And then we also need time for the preparations and rituals.
It goes nyok-nyok!
It has already burst.
Already burst!?.
Really!?.
Come here and listen!
Why cause even more suffering?.
An operation is useless and nothing but unnecessary pain.
Come here, come here.
Burst!
Nothing more can be done.
Why kill, when it isn't necessary?.
We people of the land of Dharma don't kill any animals if it isn't necessary.
The animal will die anyway, why cause it additional suffering?.
I promised the salt men that if the yak dies, I'll pay them 200 yuan.
The meat will be eaten.
We shall use it, we don't throw it away.
For me and my people, salt is our life.
Like this time, those people who sent their animals along with us, they also expect us to bring salt back with us when we return.
Therefore we have to do our best.
It's just as the proverb says:
Until victory is won, you have to strive for it.
We have to fight until we've reached our goal.
Isn't that so?.
That's one thing.
And it would also be unthinkable to come home without salt.
That's how it is, we have to do our best.
Pushuk, pushuk, what an awful wind!
We, the warlords Shenpa,
Bernag, Mishang and Ngebum must lead the army against Jang and conquer the precious salt lakes.
Mywarriors from Horwill set up their camp with three different-coloured tents: tents as white as the snow mountains, tents as black as the night, tents as red as blood.
Our people say that Lake Tsentso is the heart of His Holiness Karmapa.
After the death ofthe former Karmapa it was a problem for sixyears to find salt in this lake.
So many salt people went the long way to Lake Yaggen, others to Angtang, to Chuwo or to Lake Biru.
Since Karmapa has been reincarnated there is again salt in Lake Tsentso.
And from year toyear it seems to get better.
This salt lake is the heart of Karmapa!
That's what one used to say, but it really is so!
This is the quality of the salt.
Is this here good?.
No difference, almost as good.
This is from here, and this from over there.
This one looks a bit better.
Which one?.
It's almost the same.
If I scrape the salt together with my golden tool, it makes itselfinto a heap.
The little heaps look like halo-flowers.
There are salt flowers as far as the eye can see.
Ifyou don't know where there is salt, there is salt under my scraper!
Ifyou don't know where the scraper is, the scraper is under the handle.
Grainy, the salt is grainy.
It doesn't depend on efficiency in this work.
It depends on the karma!
And when fetching salt, on the favour ofthe goddess.
Matsenten Gyalmo is the mistress of the
Iake, they say. I don't know much more.
Matsenten Gyalmo - if I imagine her as a human being, she is a woman.
We salt men call her mother.
She is also a goddess who keeps us from starving.
We are deeply grateful to Matsenten
Gyalmo for helping us to live.
When you think ofthe mother at home, then work fast.
When you think of the mother of the salt lake, then work slowly.
When there is no salt in the salt lake it comes from not obeying the rules.
Ifyou pollute the lake, kill here or aren't friendly with each other, the lake doesn't like it, then it isn't willing to give the salt.
I once had to wait a whole month and then I was only able to
Ioad halftheyaks, therewasn't enough salt.
The reason was that we were here in people's communes and the leader of our commune had sleptwith women on theway, and this disturbed the salt lake.
You had towait, and at times it looked as if there was going to be salt - but when you went there, there was again no salt.
More water came and flushed the salt away.
So much salt is in the carrying skin, it is heavy and full to the brim.
The salt is plentiful!
The carrying skin,
Iift it to the right, tip it to the left.
That's how we throw the salt on the heap.
You, nomad from Changtang, don't remain idle, come and work with the salt!
I don't feel lonely.
Since I was 1 3 to 1 4 years old
I've always been herding animals.
My merit is that I can handle animals, that I love them and care for them, not that I'm good at business.
I can't do business or convince others by talking.
I'm no good at smooth talking.
When I talk about responsibility - this may sound like pride - but it is so that the otherthree have far fewer worries.
They do have to go to the salt lake, extract the salt, carry it to the shore, stuff it in sacks. But at night they can sleep peacefully while I always have to worry about the animals.
I do stuffthe salt sack tightly, stuffand stuffthe lower part, so the salt won't float away on the way across the river.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the middle part, so I can rest it on my chest when loading.
I do stuff the salt sack tightly, stuff and stuff the top, so the rain won't wash the salt away.
Hello, Pargen!
Hello!
-Is the salt soon ready?.
-Yes.
So soon?. Quicker than last year!
Yes, this time it went well.
Was it hard work?.
No, it was quite easy.
Then I'll slowly bring the animals round to the salt lake.
Take some snuff!.
Never in my life did it go as quickly as this time, it's like a dream!
Even such things can happen.
An old proverb says: Stay at the salt
Iake for eight days, leave on the 9th, that's how it must be.
Yes, that's the most convenient time.
And that's just the case with us this time. We really are lucky!
That all went so well this time...
That is pure luck!
...is thanks to our local god Tanglha, the Lamas or our own efforts.
The goddess accompanies the salt men all the way right to their front door, where the women and barking dogs greet them.
Yes, that's what one used to say.
The goddess Matsenten Gyalmo has shown us her great favour.
The soft snow this morning is like a water offering for the goddess.
Are there many lorries at the salt lake?.
At first only two, now there are more.
That's never been.
Only so few!?.
Now the yaks, too, will be happy.
The olderyaks, who have been to the salt lake before, think:
We shall go hungry today, but tomorrow we can return to the pastures.
The yaks who have never been here wonderwhy they have to walk so far and yet never get to the grass.
And they can't talk either!
Pull up with the left hand, sew with the right hand, whoever can't do that may not belong to the salt men.
The sack has an opening ofa "to".
Take needle and thread, sew the sack up tightly.
Theyak is wild.
At the opening ofthe sack the thieflurks.
You'll regret not having sewn it well!
Her character is that of a rather angry goddess who is very sensitive to disturbances.
If the men here quarrel, if they sleep with women or break wind at the lake, she reacts very strongly and directly to these things.
Only Margen enjoys a certain freedom here.
He doesn't have to be as careful as we.
The lake forgives him the most.
Bad deeds aren't allowed here, otherwise there's no salt.
Negative actions have the same results.
Nowadays the goddess has become more gentle, that's what the older people say.
I myselfhaven't so much experience here.
The good father is Amu Kangri.
The good mother is Matsenten Gyalmo.
The good sons are Gedun and Busum.
Maywe return to the salt lake next spring with manyyaks, many Bopsas and in good company and return safely back home again.
The Lamas, meditation gods, sacrificial goddesses, tutelary gods...
Mayyou,
Mother Matsenten Gyalmo, accept with pleasure the sacrificial yak.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
You accept, Mother Gyalmo, accept the offering with joy.
And now the goddess allows us one last shovel of salt.
We, your good sons, return home with joy.
The god of victory in the body of man,
King Gesar,
Iooked at the warriors with the eyes of the ruler and the merciful.
And he gave them the initiation ofthe ninefold Vajra and the transformation of the soul.
Finally the great
King Gesar raised his divine voice and sang the song of the conquest of the twelve salt lakes, ofthe capture of Yulha and ofthe subjugation ofJang.
OM MANI PADME HUM.
After a return journey of 45 days the caravan came back to their families.
For one more year the salt secured them their living.
The systematic modernization increases the serious threat to the right of existence of the Tibetan salt nomads and so to the last feeling of freedom in this country.
With the decline ofthe salt men's tradition another part of cultural identity of the Tibetans will be lost.
This film is dedicated to the salt men and their families.
Our most sincere thanks go to Margen,
Pargen, the Lord of the Animals and Bopsa for having allowed us to accompany them on their extraordinary journey.
We interrupt this program to bring you
a special news bulletin.
Ernest Strohbecker
and two accomplices...
... escaped from a maximum- security
ward in Bellevue Hospital last night...
... after brutally stabbing two nurses
and a custodian to death.
Strohbecker is extremely dangerous,
brutal and unpredict...
Harry?
Harry?
Harry?
Harry!
He has the hots for you.
For me? No.
Cut. Brilliant.
Natasha!
Okay, I think we have a little communication gap here.
When I said "more"...
...I didn't mean trash the fucking set.
This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just another victim.
You get stabbed. You die.
I want to see the pain.
I want to see the blood spurting.
Billy, where was the blood?
I want to see her bleed to death.
Okay? Okay?
Let's do it again, folks!
You make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your elbow.
- Okay?
- Sure.
We're gonna be here till Christmas, right?
Natasha!
Tell him you make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your elbow.
- Okay.
- Tell her...
...that he will get it right next time.
She heard you.
Y'all keep forgetting she can hear you perfectly well.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Okay, from the top.
Stop. Stop. Stop!
What's the holdup?
What is he saying?
He says he's awfully sorry, but he needs at least a day to redress the set.
A day?
Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of the corpse, and that'll wrap it for today.
All right. Okay.
So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a slow zoom into the puddle of blood...
Billy.
Madame Olga wants some sugar in her blood again.
Thank you.
So, he's kind of cute.
Three months in Moscow, cold winter nights...
Just a thought.
Billy, that's what Mom would say.
Hi.
He says use more white like a real dead body.
Okay, Boris, get everyone ready.
Out of frame, Billy.
What is going on now?
Andy. Sorry, 6:00.
- One more shot!
- We have no time.
One shot! I can't believe this.
She needs to go get Strohbecker's face.
Right! His dummy falls off the balcony on Monday.
We'll wait here for you.
Karen, she's got her own car.
Okay. Okay. Don't forget tonight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fiesta!
I'm making my famous chili con Clarke.
Alex, what do you say? You coming?
Sorry. I have tickets for the Bolshoi Ballet tonight.
Well, try and stay awake.
Yeah!
Damn.
Honey! Honey, can you get that?
Honey!
I'm in the shower!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Didn't it even cross your mind?
It could've been Billy.
I was thinking about dinner.
I'm still thinking about dinner.
She's not there either. Shit.
Okay.
Hello, Billy! Thank God. She's there.
- Are you all right?
- Ask her about the mask.
You want to tap something through?
Wait. Wait.
- Oh, man!
- A...
- Oh, man!
...O...
- Man!
...L?
- Oh, man.
- Was it L? The second letter, was it L?
Shit!
A-L-L?
O-K.
- We're eating out tonight.
- Okay.
So are you coming over now?
Do you have the mask?
Well, don't worry. Just get over here.
You hungry?
Bye.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Hey.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
I can explain.
Hello?
Billy!
Wait. I explain.
Lyosh! Lyosh!
Hello!
Hello? Is anybody there?
- Come here, quickly!
- Oh, my God, Billy.
Quickly!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
She slipped and fall bad. Poor Billy.
Andy, she's at the back!
Get the doctor, quickly.
You go. I'll stay here with her.
- Let go of her.
- No, I must hold her. She must not move.
Danger she'll never walk again if she move.
- Go!
- Yeah, okay.
Andy!
Billy!
Billy, you mustn't move.
You may become paralyzed.
It's dangerous.
Don't worry. I'll be right back. I promise.
Andy!
What's going on?
Andy, go with the janitor and fetch an ambulance!
- Billy's had an accident.
- What?
Don't just stand there! Do it now!
Ambulance!
Come on!
It's all right, sweetie. I'm here now, and an ambulance is on its way.
Let go of her.
She's trying to say something.
Police?
Murder?
Andy! Andy!
Excuse me. It's true.
We just fake murder.
If we really want to murder, why make film of it?
We're not stupid, really.
No, no. Sorry.
We understand how she feel.
She think she see a real murder and panic.
Where did you see the murder from?
And it was this man?
But you say here, "He wore a stocking pulled over his head.
And then they chased me through the building and try to kill me as well."
Guys! Guys. English, please.
We make test for you.
For your film.
We try make blood much big.
He's lying!
Sorry, Billy. We not tell you.
Keep secret not to hurt your feelings.
- I would've let you done tests.
- Andy.
What I mean is...
Let's see their film.
I'll know if it's real.
You're right.
Wait. Stop!
He could expose the film.
Let her do it. Please.
This lets you unload the film without needing a darkroom.
I see.
God, it's hot in here.
If he had exposed the film to the light, he could have destroyed all the evidence.
Actually, I haven't done this since film school.
Right. It's safe in the can now.
Here. Take it to the lab immediately for developing.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Murder weapon? Where?
Stop. Stop. Stop!
- I'm...
- What?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
- You...
Oh, my God!
- Tastes sweet.
- It's for the actors.
They put the stuff in their mouths.
- What she say?
- That it's her knife.
They broke into her box and used the blood.
So now she say it was a trick.
It happened so fast she couldn't see the knife clearly.
But everything else she saw tonight was clear?
The body in the elevator shaft.
She saw that.
- What?
- What? What?
Sweet.
- It is fake blood.
- It's fake blood.
They could have soaked the sheets in fake blood afterwards.
But where is the body?
Here you say, "A head cut off."
Wait. Wait.
She says...
Well, there were more bags in there before.
No, she's right.
I will show you.
From lift shaft we take the rubbish here.
Fast. Easy.
Hey, we need that.
Sorry, I can do nothing for you now.
But I will call you after I see the film. Okay?
Sorry.
Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life.
I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro.
She'd know the difference between a real murder and a gag.
Please, has she even seen a real murder?
That's my point.
If what she saw tonight was real, then she has seen the difference, right?
Oh, come on. We all bought the guy cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it.
Because you're a wuss.
I'm gonna let that slide.
No offence, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today using that guy's knife.
It was her knife. God!
Whatever. It looked good.
Shut up.
Buka!
Buka?
Buka.
Buka.
Please, Billy, take some of mine.
You'll feel better.
Okay.
Could you pass me the salt, please?
You could at least make the effort.
Listen...
...l'm sorry. All I can think about now is the movie, but as soon as we get back...
...I promise, I'll learn.
- How often have I heard that?
Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying.
What?
Okay, how about this?
- Means "makeup," right?
- Wrong.
It means somebody's look, the expression on their face.
- That was close.
- Billy said...
...she'll never forget the look on the girl's face...
...from the moment she knew she was gonna die.
She said the pain and the terror was real.
You can't act that.
Come closer, Mr. Hausmann.
I won't bite.
- Did it go smoothly?
- About the money...
- Did it go smoothly?
- Yes, of course. No problem.
Did it go smoothly, Mr. Hausmann?
- We did our job. The condition was...
- That everything would go smoothly.
Yes. Yes, and we have your diskette.
And who informed the police?
American girl say something, but nobody believe her.
As long as there are witnesses, there's no money.
You mean...?
I think we understand each other,
Mr. Hausmann.
You can come back to our place, and we'll set up the couch if you want.
You're not on one of your "I'll show her how independent I am" kicks, are you?
Honey, you coming or what?
- Andy, don't you care about her?
- I don't care? I don't care?
Fine. I'm calling the American
Embassy tonight, okay?
- It's the weekend. They're closed.
- Not for us.
My dad gave me the duty officer's number before we left, just in case.
So say goodbye.
Mr. Lovett, these are the two officers who answered the complaint.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Please speak English to the ambassador's secretary.
My chief asked me to meet Mr. Lovett here.
If this witness is correct about what she saw tonight...
...she may help my investigation.
- Your English is good, Mr. Larsen.
- My mother was a translator.
- In the university?
- No. KGB.
Please.
We've been tracking gangsters in Moscow...
...running an international pornography and prostitution racket.
Sit down, please. We have information they have made snuff films here...
...and sold them all over the world.
Snuff film. Is that what I think it is?
Victims believe they are making a sex film...
...but they are murdered in front of the camera.
What is the name of the witness?
What is it?
- Billy Hughes, sir.
- Billy Hughes. Yes.
She claims to have seen one being made.
The victims are illegal immigrants exploited as prostitutes by a gang...
...headed by one man.
He is brutal, ruthless.
They call him The Reaper.
I'm surprised his men gave up the film so easily.
If it is what I think it is...
...our witness, Billy Hughes, is in great danger.
Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.
Hello.
Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.
Hello.
Have you seen, how do you say, snuff film before?
Have you seen, how do you say, snuff film before?
I saw a woman tied to a tree...
...kept alive while her arms and legs were cut off.
It's hard to talk about it...
...or even think about it.
And it makes you sick to watch it.
You never forget the look in the victim's eyes.
The sheer panic and horror...
...when they realize they're about to die.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Right.
Right.
Right, sir. Right, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. I appreciate the call. I'll give Dad your best. Right.
Well?
I told you.
There's nothing to worry about.
He says the film's the biggest piece of shit he's ever seen.
Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking.
Hi, Billy. It's Karen.
I hope you weren't sleeping. I just wanted to check and see if you're okay.
I am fine. No need to worry.
Did you call earlier?
No, I got straight through.
You sure you're okay?
Sure. Had bath. All fine.
Now I go to bed. You too.
I just wanted to tell you...
...they saw the film, and it's not the real thing.
That's good. Right?
Did I hear something there?
Doorbell. Wait. I'll see who.
What? It's almost 1:00.
I wouldn't get that, Billy. Billy?
Billy? You be careful, now.
Check who it is first.
Please. I want to talk.
- Billy! Billy, are you still there?
- Would you leave her alone?
I heard a noise, Andy.
Something's happened. I swear.
Billy!
Okay, that's it. I'm going there.
What?
Karen, help. Call police. Emergency.
Hello?
- Hello?
- Police, emergency.
Police?
Yes.
Da.
Hello, my name is Billy Hughes.

Billy Hughes speaking.
This is a digital voice computer.

My name is Billy Hughes.
Yes? What do you want, please?
Hello?

Hello? Hello? I speak English.
Are you okay?
If you just give your address,

Hello?
Where's the diskette?
Where is the diskette?
I know you have!
My name is Alexander Larsen.
I'm a policeman. Take your clothes.
We must get out of here.
You must hurry.
I explain everything in the car.
In the car. No time now.
They are coming.
We are in great danger.
Quick.
It's not over yet.
- My...
- Oh, my God, it's trashed!
Billy, where are you?
I'll call the police!
Billy. Oh, Billy. Oh, my God.
How do you work this thing?
Oh, there it is.
Someone's dead in the ba...
God! Oh, my God!
- Get the door!
- Get a chair!
- Get the chair!
- What chair?
- The chair!
- Out of the way! Move!
- Put it over there!
- Move! Get the wardrobe over!
- Andy, quick!
- Push it!
I'm pushing! Get out of the way!
What are you doing?
I can't. Oh, my God!
- I can't. I can't! You hold the door!
- Get out of the way!
- Come here! Andy! Come here!
- Don't yell at me!
I'm trying to get the goddamn wardrobe near the fucking door!
Oh, my God!
The girl you saw murdered tonight...
...her boyfriend stole a diskette full of information.
Money, names, connections, everything.
He blackmailed The Reaper.
Very dangerous. And now he thinks that you have the diskette.
Me?
You have it?
We don't have any diskettes.
Not that one. That's my script.
The girl had it when she went into the studio.
Then she was murdered, and it was gone.
Where is it?
Think. You were the only person there.
Think.
Write. Write it.
Write it.
Quick, write.
Police? Yes. Yes, but only with the diskette.
Why?
You know, I work undercover.
The Reaper thinks I work for him.
Trust me. Trust me.
Crazy!
They'll kill you!
Get in!
Get in!
Please, give me the keys.
Write. Where is the diskette?
We cannot escape in this car.
Write. Write.
Studio. Where in the studio?
Delta three. Delta three.
Delta three. Delta three.
What?
What?
This is all a big misunderstanding and...
Excuse me, but this is...
You don't have to arrest us.
Why is he arresting me?
This is ridiculous.
I'm an American citizen.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm a director.
I'm directing a movie here.
I'm bringing a lot of money in.
And my father, okay, he knows a lot of big people, and... Listen.
You want money?
Is that what you want?
I don't understand what is going on here.
We don't have a diskette!
You have one more chance to tell me where is diskette.
The diskette.
You know, I mean, this is ridiculous.
We don't have a diskette.
That's what I'm saying.
Karen, get the key!
Get the key! Unlock me!
Find the key!
- He's not gonna move, is he?
- Okay, okay.
- Delta three. Delta three.
- Let's get out of here.
- Answer it.
- Why?
They may say something about Billy.
Delta three.
I got something about studio. Come on.
Look out!
It's not what you think.
What do you say...? How do you...?
In Russian, what...?
What? What does that mean?
- Hel...
- Hello? We need help!
I'm a director, and I'm making a movie here. This is not a movie.
Put the gun away.
You look like a hit man.
- He thinks we're gonna kill him!
- We're not gonna kill you!
- This is not even ours!
- The policemen wanted to kill us!
- We gotta get out of here.
- I think we should call the cops.
- Are you crazy?
- Well, we can explain this.
Explain? You are crazy.
Come on. Here.
I'll take these too.
And now?
Child locks.
Don't look now, but our friends are still here.
I will block the other entrances.
What are you doing?
That's Red Square.
Oh, perfect.
This damn gun, I can't work the safety.
Holy shit!
Around the back.
- Okay. Jump, Andy. I got you.
- What?
I got you. I got you.
It's no use. All lines are cut.
Where is it?
You helped us a lot, Billy. Thank you.
The Reaper wants to meet the woman...
...who has kept him up all night and witnessed a live snuff.
He wants you to do it.
You know why we call him The Reaper?
You see his face, you die.
Nice night, isn't it?
I'm just taking a piss.
Right, you know, just...
Who the hell is that?
Well, whoever it is, they're coming here.
- I can't work the safety.
- Andy, come on.
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
Hurry!
Where is she, Larsen?
- Larsen, are you reading me?
- Somebody's coming.
I'm waiting.
I'm bringing her out now.
- Shoot him. Shoot him, Andy.
- Okay.
Be careful of Billy! God.
Billy!
Stay where you are!
Run, Billy. Run! Run!
Stand back!
Not out there!
Kill her, Larsen.
No!
Now please, let me explain.
- Please?
- Explain?
Karen!
Will you...?
Kill him.
You genius!
You thought we were tourists, huh?
Guess again, pal.
Don't move.
Don't move! I'm talking to you!
I'm warning you.
Don't move or I'm gonna shoot you!
Okay, one more step! All right.
- Billy! Billy! Billy!
- She's okay. She's fine.
She's okay?
I'm fine.
A cop?
A cop?
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
Forget it. Your sister was brilliant.
Next time, hit back.
Oh, this is the remote.
- I get it.
- Big cowboy.
What?
That was an invitation to dinner sometime.
How you say...?
It would be a pleasure.
Pleasure?
My pleasure.
- I still don't understand.
- What?
I don't understand...
...why The Reaper didn't take the diskette off me.
Who?
Shit. I'm sorry.
Big cowboy.
Billy, tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
What's the matter?
Big cowboy.
Guys, could we get out of here, please?
The expression?
The car?
The car...
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!
Eng subs ripped by
..::McLane::..
Oh, man!
This stinks - shitty job.
Any plans for this weekend?
The game on Saturday
Oh, something new.
What? You want to come?
Oh, no. Soccer? No way.
Sometimes I wonder what you do when you're off.
Sunday I'm taking a spin
The new turbo's in
What does your fiance say?
Uschi-bear?
I never talk cars with her
Sure. I understand.
Clean that off!
You bet. Right away.
Police!
Don't move.
More police!
Turn off that crap.
Hands up in the air.
Come on, get out.
Hands on there.
Damned
You can start the reports.
We get the best part again
Thanks.
Is that her?
Yes, that's her.
She's srewing the captain?
And has a relative in the city hall.
Hello.
Hello. 
You saw what happened. 
Distract and bust.
Ah, I'm astounded.
Can't say we share our know-how
Sh-t, sh-t, sh-t...
REGULAR GUYS
You guys sure showed that babe.
I got something to show her.
If she ever sees it...
Hey, it's too big to miss.
How about a beer?
Not today.
Uschi trouble again?
Just a temporary low.
Good evening.
Uschi-bear?
I told you.
Either the new ngine or me.
And what's that?
My new turbo.
Sorry, man. Fate.
Want to know something?
Something true?
Really, really true.
The absolute truth.
Men...
Men are just better people.
Tell me it's not true.
A guy...  Sh-t.
I don;t believe it.
Hello, how're you? 
Hungover?
What?
Coffee or tea?
I'll make both.
Aspirin's up there.
What time is it?
No idea,
Nine I think...
Damned.
I just have toasts with margerine there
How do you like your toast?
I wouldn;t go out like that.
Not a good idea.
But I have to be at the stakeout.
Uh, work. Where are my clothes?
In the washer.
Beer stains.
I'll drive you.
What kind of clothes?
Anything that fits.
Ok?
Very ok.
Where do you work?
I'm with the...
I work for the city.
Go on, what happened then?
It was drinks on the house.
Then I took you home.
You kept saying you were homeless.
And then?
We went to bed.
That is... I put you to bed.
Up there's fine.
Your clothes?
Where can I send them?
My garage is in the back.
The offer still stands. 
Stay at my place.
Thanks, but no, thanks, Edgar.
Say... Anything happened last night?
Well... nothing you didn't want.
Welcome to the club.
I'm looking for a flat. 
Are they renting?
A hard night?  Leave me alone.
Solo déjame en paz
Nice outfit. New disguise?
¿Nuevo camuflaje?
Just joking.
Oh, I'm not fucking the captain.
And i don't have a relative in the city hall
I'm just here to learn.
I have to make a phone call.
Coming?
Yes
I'll feed the pidgeons.
Keep an eye on the bar.
Anything unusual happens, take pictures.
Real tough work.
-That bimbo?
- Some 'bimbo'? 
2 semesters of sociology.
A year of law, even a month at the FBI Academy.
Careerwise, she has everything we don't.
If life was halfway fair, she'd at least look like sh-t.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Ever had an AIDS test?
What? Does Ursula...?
Did you get laid without a rubber?
Do me a favour. Don't ask.
Horny?
If you want to talk to us: just do it. Now.
Uschi, it's me.
Please answer, 
I know you're at home.
My sweet cub...
You can't imagine what a night I had.
Ursula...
Ok. That was it. Thanks, bye.
Asshole.
Can i stay with you a few days?
With me?
Hey I'm sorry I... What? That bad?
Sweet cub, listen... 
I gave up my apartment
Prematurely, I admit...
But we're still engaged.
And I need my car keys.
Yes, i know the trade fair's going on.
What?
The Men's Shelter?
Are you crazy?
Did you order a "Pizza con tutto"?
And a green salad.
Do you accept credit cards? 
I'm out of cash.
Wait.
Here. A jeans shirt? 
Top quality.
Just your size and colour.
98 Marks new.
Want some wine too?
Thanks, not really, but...
How to say... could I sleep at your place?
Excusi, I've got to get back to the Pizzeria...
Not like that.
I'm fairly normal.
There has to be a bed somewhere in this town.
Take credit cards?
If I have to.
Then, a big breakfast.
Orange juice, coffee...
A mineral water and a softboiled egg.
Do you have a toilet?
Inside.
That's my car!
Leave my car alone!
You asshole!
It's no use, that's what the police are for.
Yes, I know.
It's not gonna look too hot on your record.
Thanks a lot.
You and ursula. Is it serious?
What's wrong with women these days?
Can you tell me?
Too many hormones in the water?
Am I plumber?
Your fiance missed this.
Sorry, wrong topic.
I'm going to be around a while.
Can we adjust to that?
And if you feel as bad as you look,
I can't help it.
Alright, I'm going on my round.
You do yours later.
Have a problem?
Yes, you could call it that.
Mr. Nice Guy
Name's Petrov; organizes the fake plates.
We want the "Czar"
We only know he's 60, Russian, drives a Jag.
And he's bringing fake papers.
I wanted to buy a round tonight.
But no sense inviting him.
Right. No point.
But I accept.
You look tired. 
I tried to sleep in my car.
Could I spend a few nights here after all?
On the sofa?
Wherever. I have a guest room.
Feel right at home.
I have your clothes.
Edgar..., thanks.
It was love at first sight.
Listen, just a moment!
Tea? coffee? Or both?
Uh, before this gets complicated...
What's complicated?
I just need a bed for a night. 
Only.
And I'm only into women.
Too bad. Oh, no more coffee.
That's the way it is.
Fine.
No coffee.
- You know what I mean.
- Sure. Mineral water?
I could use a real drink.
Why are you a cop?
Acute case of BSE.
I wanted to work in a zoo, but Im alergic to cats.
Really. No bullsh-t.
You guys think
I'm on a career trip, right?
You're smart and attractive.
So you don't have a chance.
Thanks for the straight answer.
How about you?
Just don't bring any cats to work.
If that's what you mean.
I never mix work and pleasure.
Sure.
Look who's coming.
Who's that woth him?
A colleague?
No idea.
Hola, ¡aquí estás!
Hi, I'm Mike.
This is Edgar, a friend of a friend.
Hi Edgar. Helen.
We work together.
For the city too?
Kind of...
In the same unit.
Not tax people, I hope?
Red Libanese?
You're hip?
I hope so.
Smoke a lot?
Now and then.
You don't know each other long?
Eh?
Why?
Just asking.
The D.A's office complained they can't reach you off duty and about your answering machine
Oh
I'd say we ignore it for now.
Inspector Niemcek.
Detective Rennmark.
Inspector Schwenk.
And what do you do?
Me? I remodel stolen cars.
Then we're a great team.
Where can we reach you?
My place.
At least for the next few weeks.
4 8 3 9 6 5 for the next 2 weeks. yes, yes. Temporarily.
Have an address?
Wiehlandstrasse 157, 
3rd floor on the right.
Yeah...
He forgets it.
I'd better tattoo it on him.
What does Schwenk have against me?
Ah, Schwenk is a bit confused and doesn't want you to think he's a jerk.
So he overdoes it.
More than usual.
Bueno, más de lo habitual
Clear. As long as I don't have to understand that - it's fine.
I can't invite you up for a coffee.
- Sure, not a good idea.
- Yes.
It's ok. I understand.
Good night.
Hello, ursula Roth isn't in and Christof Schwenk is dead...
If you have a message, leave it now.
I hope you're doing it with your steroid monster.
Just remember. 
The more muscle upstairs -
- the less downstairs.
What are you looking at?
Beat it.
I'll keep track.
No problem.
Not feeling well?
If you want to talk... 
Good night.
A cop. I got myself a cop.
Oh no, it's Saturday!
Good morning.
Law and order, right?
'mornin'
Say...your upstairs neighbours...
Yeah, yeah, they play hard.
If it turns you on, you know where to find me.
I thought men like you were neater.
Mmm, what else do you know about "men like me"?
Sorry, forget it.
I don't know any...
¡Gays!
The word is Gays
G-A-Y three letters, easy to remember.
Try it sometime.
And if it's hard to say, practice makes perfect.
Fine, I'll try it. 
Sometime.
Say... can you iron?
Sure. years of pro bachelorhood.
Then marry me.
Don't ogle me.
You're blinding me.
And wipe that 
"I'll get you" grin off your face.
I'm only into women.
The wrong ones maybe.
Fine, you said it. I heard it.
All I do all day long is think about getting into your pants.
Fine. I'll check the papers.
I'll have a place by Monday.
Monday? When did you look for a place last?
The year they killed Kennedy?
Edgar Sänger
Hi, Marko.
At my place?
Not this weekend.
I have company.
Not a man.
My mother's here. 
You know how she just showes up.
Some other time, okay?
Hollo mamá
How about a spin?
It doesn't have tags.
You have enough illegal ones.
You searched my place?
All day long I think about how I can bust used car dealers.
I tripped over them.
If you take back the
"used car dealer" then...
May I?
Drive my car.
Look at that. Well, well, well.
Schwenk and mechanic?
On a test drive?
We questioned tnhat guy last year.
The oldtimer connection.
Schwenk's buying a classic sports car from him?
He can't afford a used Korean scooter.
Check... if the red tag's clean.
Calm down. 
Perhaps the guy is a pal of Schwenk's.
I doubt it.
Why?
He's a faggot.
Maybe Schwenk's on duty?
Embarrassing if he isn't.
You drive like a maniac.
Red tags are for temporary use, not joy rides.
The tags? They're stolen.
Want us to bust you?
No, I want him to.
We checked this car museum out.
So. let's all do something.
Good idea.
Listen... Watch what you say on the phone, okay?
Or you're dead.
Think of your appointment.
Where? At my inspection?
No, a new job. 
Chief programmer at a major bank.
Bye.
Professor Schwarzenegger.
Very funny.
Well, sister, which one?
Doctor, I hardly know them.
2 are my parents.
Sure. The 3rd is an ass.
The 4th doesn't have one.
The 5th looks like one, the 6th snores.
The 7th's right either.
No, the one is nice but a colleague.
The other's goodlooking but a pothead. And the 3rd's... the 3rd's...
I'm exhausted.
Bad day at the hospital?
A patient died.
I know you don't want to hear it.
Motorcycle accident?
- Here    
- Thanks
A shooting star.
Or a crashing satellite.
I made a wish for you.
Oh, yeah? What?
Guess.
A man.
Thanks, sister dear.
What was the guy's name that I wrote your love letters to?
Efi something...
Efi Katlevsky
You and your helper syndrome.
I thought he was interesting.
I wish you had a real man again.
I'd prefere an apartment.
But all to myself?
Why is it that men are all frogs before they turn into princes?
To rid us from mosquitos.
Hey.
Still annoyed about Anton?
Afraid you can't compete?
With a guy on every billboard with muscular nipples you start wondering.
Do I know what women like?
Do they know?
Well, your figure's fine.
Thanks
How's the water?
Wet.
Good.
What are you doing?
Me? Having a bath.
Hand me the shampoo?
How about doing it later?
I always wash my hair first.
Am I making you nervous?
Yes.
Fine. The shampoo.
Very funny.
Hey, man. What's the problem?
You're only into women.
I'm safe.
Sure, and it's your tub.
This is what your mama warned you about: the big bad homo is trying to grab your gonads.
You're so funny and I'm the dumb cop.
You're the cool and 
I'm the prole. Great.
You just can't take being hit on.
You can't be a hawk, you're a mouse.
Know how I feel?
Do you even care?
Maybe I'd like a straight answer.
Like about: what happened that first night
If there's anything I should know.
Should know?
Yes! We have to talk about it.
Oh God.
Now the AIDS number.
No use running to a doctor and getting tested.
It takes weeks before they can tell.
Thanks!
Thanks a lot for provisionally declaring me dead.
I'm sorry.
It's not so easy.
Yeah.
I'll get out.
No, it's okay.
Just would've been nice...
What?
If you'd asked me.
You probably would've said no.
No? Probably...
Shampoo.
Flowers?
Hello Edgar...
He's in the tub.
And you're his mother?
No, I just live here.
Send greetings to Edgar from Marko.
Tell him I would've stayed longer but his mother is too masculine for me.
Eh, one moment. 
You've got it wrong.
I'm making my round!
Please.
Somebody has to get food.
I've been twice already.
Then you know where.
Something wrong?
Just wondering
Ah, yeah? What about?
I thought men like you were extinct.
Very funny.
A currywurst for me.
Fine, same here.
Then get them.
No wonder.
No wonder what?
You got dumped.
Where did you...?
Let's leave my personal life out of this.
Now we're talking about lunch.
Praise the Lord.
Is it any of your business?
What do you know about me?
What I know about you?
Yes!
I'll tell you what I know.
I know there was always someting on TV whenever she wanted to talk.
That after every fight, you brought her some dumb present to clear the air.
You don't know the coulour of her eyes or when the last time was you did what she wanted in bed.
You go nuts when she has her menstruation cycle.
And your definition of a nice weekend is a big soccer game. or joyriding on the autobahn.
You cut your toenails watching TV.
You think that "Married with Children" is an educational show.
That's about it. Enough?
Cut it out please.
Looking in my head.
Gives me a migraine.
Nothing in there could hurt.
Say... how you'd know all that?
Me?
I used to know someone like you.
Fine, I'll make my round and get some food. 
Is sausage (currywurst) alright?
I need 5 minutes out there alone.
You think I've changed recently?
I know what you have.
A midlife crisis. But it'll pass.
Idiot.
Women don't react to me like they used to.
Don't worry about it.
For example - I react to you.
I'm going to check the back.
Chuck the sausages, guys.
A green Jaguar just pulled up.
Is the guy Russian?
I graduated a Russian school, 
I'll ask him.
What's she up to?
Sh-t, sh-t, sh-t. Is she crazy?
Wait till he answers in Russian.
I know the face.
- Police
- Hands on the trunk!
- And speed it up. No tricks!
- Great. And is he Russian?
- Surely Russian.
Spread the legs.
I recognize his face.
Distract and bust.
You're going to be sorry.
Let's see what we have here.
I never forget a face.
Guys, guys... you almost ruined the concert.
But you made the papers.
Well, somebody has to direct traffic.
- Too bad.
- Real funny, guys.
Speaking of traffic...
Schwenk, next time you drive around town with red tags, make sure they're clean.
Do you owe us one again?
Here, for your new colleague.
She wanted to take a look.
If she wants
We'll show her a thing or two.
Yes, there will be a tough night for Rennmark colleague
Well, you can go to console.
I do not know if I need just to me for that.
Oh, she has a man?
No, living with a woman.
Yes? So what?
What's special about that?
Nothing. I just said that living with a woman.
Oh, and immediately you have to draw conclusions.
Conclusions? What conclusions?
Oh, no. If I have not suggested it has something with it.
Say it loud so rejoice colleagues.
You're crazy. Who usually make those comments in bad taste about lesbians and homos ah? 
I do not. Seriously I do not!
No, Christof Schwenk called. 
Christof Schwenk,
The king of the jokes about fags.
Man, excellent.
Yes?
Ah, yes, I'm Christof. "Helen is?
No, he is sleeping.
The issue has affected her and took a bottle of wine.
If, uh, just wanted to deliver this.
Goodbye
Goodbye.
Tell me, should I give any reason?
Eh, yes, maybe I'm very sorry.
Today I spent in tone.
And it is a great companion.
Goodbye
Your cop-friend was here.
I said you were sleeping.
Which partner?
The frog?
Yes. I told him to leave.
Too bad. I would have liked to squash him.
What did he want?
Nothing.
He apologized and said you were an excellent companion.
Not Schwenk?
Oh yes, good night.
Good night.
"Schwenki" Well, well, well.
Your guy... He can fry the eggs himself.
I used the red toothbrush. 
I hope it's alright.
I would like some tea please.
He can't even make his own tea, or what?
Don't make such a face. 
Is this a scene?
You wish, right?
I do not like seeing strange naked men in the shower
Did you forget who's apartment is this?
Tell me how did this silly toy get into your bed?
It's mine
I did not say anything
What then?
But say something!
Well...
Well. There are no pigeon poop. 
That's something.
It used to be a toy store here. great place for parties.
Yes, there is also music. 
Where does it come from?
Yes, it's the drawback. 
A movie theatre downstairs.
What;s playing? "Action Film?
Yeah, well....hardcore or...
Some action there. Softcore maybe.
Say it is not true.
A porn cinema.
The place is empty, the previous tenant left it.
Who can stand listening to sex all day?
They just disturb and entice everyone around.
This apparently was commissioned in Kiev.
Now it just has to be stolen.
Busy. Busy.
Bees make honey.
Who is that?
Marko Reiferd. 
His uncle owns a junkyard and apparently he's sold some stolen parts.
Here's a note :
"Small Fish. Observe"
- Do you know him?
- Me? No. Just wondering
Edgar, tell Marco to lay low.
What?
I do not find it funny
Do you know what awaits me if they find a connection between us?
Then the two can tweak to jail.
Maybe you'd like it.
Find him.
Problems?
Well sort of...
Your fiance, right?
Something like that.
I looked for a flat for tonight and a "fiance" might help
Mike unfortunately did not have time
If the apartment is fine, 
I may move with you.
Why? Is there something wrong with your current apartment?
It's not mine.
Edgar's had enough of you?
Not exactly.
Good compromised. Is it time?
Recently celebrated two years.
I hope in this case you're more decisive re the apartment.
Want children?
Children? Yes - by all means.
Anyway. Two, at least
It was a perfect performance
Oh, almost forgot.
Thanks.
Many compromises and breaches in recent days.
I should not have asked
Sorry if I cause trouble.
All right. Just was not adequate.
Are you sure?
It's the only thing I'm sure at this point
We will take something even
Somewhere where we can do whatever we want.
This is wonderful.
Sorry.
Maybe too much wine or the moon.
The noise last night... it wasn't us...
I realized that
We did not do anything.
My influence is positive, right?
And why you cleaned up and hid everything gay.
That is not important now.
I have to avoid rumors
And we have to seriously talk tonight about Marko
Okay, your coming out is postpone for a few days...
Promise?
I promise
I'll act straight when you see a cop.
Welcome to the Middle Ages
Good morning
Good morning
I used the green toothbrush, 
I hope you are well.
By the way, I wanted to ask a small favour
Other?
Well, I need to find a pair of strong men to help me move
And if Mike helps we'd be done in no time.
Sure, we'll be happy, right?
Sure. After all we are friends, aren't we?
Yes, Massa, yes, yes, yes
Your friend Edgar, doesn't he like me?
Eddie?
E.., Edgar? No, he likes you.
He's just a little shy.
Shy
But he has a man under the glass upright toothbrush a Priapus with gigantic erection?
Tell me, last night ...
I'd rather not talk about it
I am going through a crisis
Ah...
Okay
Good morning
Good morning
Incidentally you to just come from a power breakfast, don't you?
Work related, of course.
Hey, don't ask, okay?
Yeah, okay ... it's obvious.
At last the old Schwenk is back as we know him...
Leave me alone, OK?
What is wrong with him anyway?
Could somebody tell me?
Before I met you, my life was in order mine too.
If you were not so straight, there'd be no problem
There's a void in your life.
Okay, but I'm not the filling.
I am a accident.
Tell me ...what's with...
...a mistake.
...you and Helen?
Two cops. Absolutely impossible.
And for sure not at your place.
Any progress finding a pad?
I'm a pain, right?
Well...
There is this notion in the scene.
Every straight is gay, he just doesn't know it.
You seem to be the exception to the rule.
Unfortunately
We must separate ourselves a little
Well, I have to forget you.
I think I know what you need
How about that one over there?
What about him?
No, I do not like leather
Why? Clothes don't make the man.
And that other in the suit?
Friendly, funny, serious.
7 years ago has a stable relationship
Man, this isn't a bargain scale.
What about that one in front?
He's quite handsome.
Wow, did you also notice?
Yes, he's a pain. I know him.
So tell me what you want.
How can I know what you want?
I'm completely lost...
And there!
Where?
Well up there next to that guy.
The perfect blend of male and mouse
Come on.
Oh no, sh-t!
Colleagues
They know me.
There's a back exit.
No, too late.
Tell me that now was ...
Good evening, 
"I can see your IDs please?"
I hope that's enough.
He's one of my informers.
Have a good night.
Same to you, Inspector.
I can't believe it.
I'm running away from the police just to be in the wrong place
Welcome to the club.
For someone not homosexual you kiss pretty well
How do they know you?
"Schwenk?
With an informer that matches the description of the mechanic.
Deixel, what does that tell us?
I think ... we should check this mechanic.
Be more careful
Yes Massa. Sorry Massa ! 
I will look better next time.
If you could move your asses faster ...
What's in there? 
Lead Plates or what?
Yeah, whatever. 
Perhaps she collects weights?
Rock samples, ha?
Or heavy water?
If your policeman is no good, take the other. He's ok too.
Seem to think that I need it urgently.
You really think I need it bad.
That's not the word. 
Let me take my time.
Until you find the wrong one?
Where does this go?
Over there.
Well, what else do we have to do?
I need someone to do the renovating.
I wouldn't live in a place I renovated.
Yes, and I I have 2 left hands.
Yeah, I... I'm priceless.
Thirty for an hour.
Forty.
Thirtyfive.
I'm an idiot, but I need the money.
I take it.
You take the sofa, 
I go up to take the ironing board
You're a lazy pig.
Listen, I'm allergic to leather...
Take them both.
Leave me alone.
What?
Cut it out!
It's a miracle that no one's getting horny when left alone with these orgy sounds
Have you noticed this country is oversexed.
Totally. Everywhere you look, people are having sex. what?
Hey Chris, I have to talk to you.
One of my sources tells me that Kallenbach Deixel are interested in his garage. Officially.
They are investigating
Edgar is clean.
If you have a car that is not... would be better we get rid of him fast!
Thanks for the tip.
Edgar! "I'm at Helen's"
Sh-t.
Now he says he is a mouse.
No way! Did he?
Really?
I do not understand. 
Am I the cat?
I have the impression that you are a lot alike.
Chris says you're a little shy with women.
Well, yes...
Do I look like a rodent?
No, much better.
I'm sure you've been told that ... you have a great ass
Every now and then.
Don't misunderstand me please.
I have no intention to seduce you, you know...
I have no problem with that. Same here.
Why not?
It is in me?
No. Really. It's me... for a woman you have everything.
But I don't turn you on.
Uh, well...
Marko!
I'll give you a kick in the butt
You will not, young man.
Sorry, I didn't mean to you.
I hope so.
I am Edgar's mother.
If you don't mind...?
Yeah, right.
Thanks.
Since you live here, you can call me Iris.
Iris
Where is my son?
Is he at work?
Yes, car renovation.
By the way, I'm Christof Schwenk.
I live here temporarily.
Mind if I call you Chris?
This begins to look like a real home with civilized people.
Is that your influence?
You should definitely stay longer.
Edgar needs someone who's orderly like you. You're good for my boy
I, uh, I'm not ... I'm just ...
Yes, yes, of course.
You are right
Basically everything he does, does not concern me.
This is a misunderstanding
- Ah, no
- Yes
How did this get here?
This is mine
Aren't you both too old for this?
Listen, I'm just here a guest
Edgar and I are not ...
Calm down. I am aware of my son's sexual preferences
I mean, we live in the 90's...
And I do not have to like it if you two are happy.
Yes, but me and Edgar, a moment ...
I'm not gay.
Did you sleep with my child?
I do not know!
You do not know?
This is getting more interesting, dear Chris.
So this is the first thing you have forgotten.
But I said I'm not...
How I can start something with your boy?
I don't have to be Catholic to go to church.
But if my son now sleeps with heterosexual then you could try a woman.
Edgar's really only likes men.
How do you know?
And you too are also not too sure, right?
Besides, I know my son longer than you.
You do not think seriously that 
Edgar may have something with a woman?
It is not excluded.
Today it all works, right?
I mean, under certain circumstances, if a woman is attractive intelligent, responsible and safe, why not?
Where is she working?
Where a colleague of mine.
So?
Is she smart, responsible and attractive?
She is. and selfconfident.
You see?
That's a start.
By the way, you are also quite handsome by the way.
And you're sure you're not gay?
Me?
Hello, Eddi, dear!
Mother!
When did you come here?
Got a valid search warrant?
I had an interesting conversation with your charming roommate.
Ok, then I'm going to unpack the rest and then I will lie down from... the trip...
But tomorrow I have to hear all about your pretty boss.
Good night
Good night
Why are you so late, eh?
How?
Surely you had too much to renovate, 
Eddi, my dear.
Tell me, are you both crazy or have smoked something?
Better tell me where will I sleep. 
With your mother?
My bed is big enough.
You wish. No way.
Then sleep in the bathtub or under a bridge or go to a brothel. You and my mother
You two get on my nerves,
That I can assure you.
Do not worry. 
He's inherited this from his father.
It's a madhouse.
But none of weaknesses, right?
If my mother is visiting, 
I never can... anyway.
Great mother
Oh, you sh-t.
Even if one of you is not gay you look like a perfect match.
The coffee is ready
Oh, mother ...
Ah, Marko
Feeding time! Oh...
I just woke up to the tigers.
I'm Iris, the mother of Edgar. 
Good morning.
Rennmark Helen, I'm Chris'n colleague
Ah, the beautiful Employer. Guys, have seen
Helen
You must tell me all about you.
Okay, here's the deal: 
You do not say you are gay and I tell you that your garage me be searched.
Not enough.
If I turn my character, you have to help me with something.
Help?
The red Alfa on the patio is stolen
Insurance believes that six months ago is Ishinovkahot
Help me movi it out tonight
It's landing in the press, okay?
No selling spare parts, no traces, no trouble, ok?
OK?
Ok
Hi Helen
Hi Edgar
Good morning, Helen
Good morning
So early in the job?
Yes, the heater in the room was damaged.
I have to talk to you Iris.
Iris, well, she is a colleague.
Please do not tell her Edgar is gay. 
Please.
Just the opposite
And if something goes wrong with your garage, make sure it's clean. immediately, okay?
Promised.
And not a word to Chris. 
This is a spontaneous breakfast visit
This car is fantastic
Alfa
Fantastic
I had one like this
Exactly like this one, really.
Till 6 months ago;
Oh, yeah?
And now it's gone
The Alfa.
How is that?
Missing, lost...
I was drunk and crashed into a wall
Totaled it
And then the police took my license. 
Imagine
Sons of b-tches
Don't you think also that the cops ...?
Nice car. Alfa
F-cking cops.
For this engine would have given me 5000
Goes to press
A beautiful car...Alfa... super class!
The cars and the engine will be finished soon
Have you heard about the ozone hole?
I'm seeing a very big one in front of me.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah
Let's make a break.
This smells like chicken poop
Aren't we exaggeratting a little?
Something stinks here. 
I can smell it.
Well, for you.
But look.
The informer and his teacher...
They act like a team.
Makes you wonder:
Why did his fiance suddenly throw him into the street?
You think...?
I will guess...
Schwenk?... gay?
Sorry I came so late
Thanks
Where?
There. I do not know what's happening with Schwenk.
He keeps avoiding me for days.
I heard the rumour that you're on the hunt for Helen
That ought to cheer you up.
Take the mechanic. 
At least he can fix something.
Am I wrong, colleagues, or smells a little chicken poop?
Very funny
Take a cold beer
That is needed. The gay one is here.
What happens?
Better that we leave.
You know what? 
I'm getting tired of you.
I go to parties I want to go
And I'm on holiday I want.
I do not know why, but my compass points to Chris.
And what are you waiting for?
Schwenk lately is living with the mechanic
Yesterday we went to look more closely at the car lot
And who comes home late at night hand in hand?
Like a couple in love
Schwenk with Edgar
Be careful not to let him get too close to you
Come Deixel
Chris?
What re you going out there?
You'll cath a cold.
It may not be as gay as you think
Or just on weekends or days or something.
Oh, yeah? Most men I know think they're tigers
Or at least a roosters
But that one says he's a mouse
That sounds pretty gay to me.
But mice breed.
Almost always, as a rule
It's so embarrassing.
"Helen?
Tell me - do you find it embarrassing or are in love with him?
I think both
This is serious. Are you going out already?
Not until I'm dead.
What did Mike want from you?
You're like a mother.
I do not want you to call me "mother"
But mothers do not have to know everything
Only makes them worry more
Now we're so comfortable here,
It must be like our first night
When?
Ah... again you're avoiding the subject.
I would not think even in my dreams. 
It's too exhausting
I know now what happened that time...
But I still won't tell you...
But I still don't know...
You really don't?
Ah, that... again...
It's gotten to be a reflex.
How can I explain it otherwise...?
Much could not have happened...
Raspberry.
What does that mean? "Yes" or "No"?
I don't know.
Listen, you were there, no?
Yeah, right.
But not entirely.
Blackout
One moment ...
A moment.
For heaven's sake, i don't know.
He does not know.
He does not know.
That has to sink in. 
He is going to bed with me
And doesn't know!
Say ...
What exactly does that mean ? 
"I do not know".
Is it something like...
Well, I-care-not-who-I-f-ck
"I do not know"?
Or what's-one-more-matter
"I do not know"
Or maybe it's this: 
When-I've-had-enough-drinks then-f-ck-everything-that-moves. I do not know.
I say, against all my morals to sleep with a man
And I constantly wonder if 
I should stick with that or not
And you do not know!
I mean, do you really not know?
Shut up there, you perverts!
Or I'll call the vice squad.
And have you arrested.
I just know that I'm fond of you a lot.
Same here.
They say that nowadays everything is possible.
Yes.
But it is not true.
Simply not true
Sorry.
True love stories almost always end badly.
Listen
I, um ...
When an old octopus is too alone in an aquarium
He begins biting off his tentacles.
Well, I'm just a young gay but 
I don't want to come to that.
Wouldn't suit you either.
I know. I think I'll better get going soon.
Too bad.
Yes.
Too bad.
Schwenk is not gay
No? He lives with a "homo" and embraces him in public
He swings his hips better than Madonna already...
Hold on to your values...
Hey, Schwenk, here is only for men.
This shower room's for us.
Schwenk, do not go crazy, if you don't tip off your boyfriend and his pals, everything is fine.
He's really cute
I'm really hot for tough guys, like you or Deixel
Where's your partener?
Unfortunately you only do it together
You piss together, shower together.
So do you think I'm gay?
Okay, so I am
GAY, GAY
Three-letter word
G, A and Y. 
Got it?
And your little secret?
And your partner...
Leaning on some hooker for a quickie.
We all know that!
Yes, and him
When have you paid last time for the Turkish meals?
Ah, Deixel!
Using your handcuffs again off-duty?
Or is that why your poor wife had a black eye the other day?
So from now on I'm the gay guy in this sedeshow!
Happy?
Have a good night.
You macho queen!
Oh, sorry about that.
You were good out there.
Back there?
You were... really would not have expected something like that from you
It was courageous.
Thanks
Although I also think it's lousy too.
Lousy? What?
That you're gay.
Oh, that.
Do not get me wrong. 
I think it's great that you're gay.
Haw long have you known?
Yeah, well ...
That does not concern me. 
I have no right to ask.
All right.
Only it's more complicated than you think.
That's right.
For some reason I can not explain,
I've fallen madly in love with you. and... the fact that you're gay does not change anything about it. just ...
Only what?
Only complicates the situation.
Or maybe eased it. or both.
Do you understand now?
Yes?
Loud and clear.
Yes? You do?
I do not.
Yes.
I understand you.
Well
Now I have only two choices
Either we stop now...
Or
Or not?
But if you really don't want to do it with a woman
There's nothing I'd rather do.
Or if the windows bother you...
There are no trees, no cats, no problem.
Well because I'm not repress
Much better
Now, nothing distracts me.
Open the door
And everything else we discuss later, right?
Yes. Later.
Much later.
They sure turned the sound up. 
Enough to drive you crazy.
Guys, I have to explain you something
It's a bit complicated, but...
Ah, sh-t!
No, boys, somehow... you could have warned me first...
After all we're on duty.
I do not mind, but ...
Shut up, Mike!
What?
Just shut up, Mike.
Ok
Sorry, colleagues. We went into action!
What?
Action!
Sh-t!
Come, come, come quick!
Sh-t!
The two escaped, you let them get away!
Why the hell didn't you guys use your walkie-talkies?
We were ...
We were in a pause.
Yes.
This break is going to cause problems and not make the D.A happy.
If the prosecutor finds out.
But Kallenbach, Kallenbach.
On a  night like this
I could care less.
Look I just finished my duty, here ...finished
Now begins my private life
Yes, this, incidentally my new boyfriend.
Yes, but you already know him.
Ah, did I ever tell you that I'm gay?
Sorry friends, I must have forgotten in the rush and it must've slipped my mind
If and when you two rabbits, make any dumb remarks, then I'll just knock your lights. OK?
Well!
So, goodbye.
Do they come with us?
Do you understand anything?
Nothing.
Have you noticed how complicated the world has become? it's hard to keep up...
In Greece, cops can retire after
15 years of service
Here is barely sufficient for a rest cure
I was told that here they send you to a spa.
Bad Salzufflen's for example.
Really? It is supposed to be nice.
Once I was in Bad Orb 
Wasn't bad...
Yes, that can feed the deer there in the park...
Deer?
"...but there's still so much to learn..."
What are you looking at?
What grade are you in?
Third.
At the De Amicis school?
Not De AmEEcis!
It's called De Amicis!
It's really pronounced
De AmEEcis.
It's De Amicis.
What's that in your ear?
Ain't you got nothin' better to do?
Sorry, there's no chocolate.
What is there?
There's vanilla, pistachio, strawberry, coffee... mint and lemon.
CouId I have a cappuccino, please?
I'm waiting on someone.
I want chocoIate.
Let's see if there's some left.
Damn!
Son-of-a-bitch!
Come out of there!
You're a third grader, too?
Yes.
So you'll be my student.
I don't beIong to anybody.
Okay, if you prefer,
I'll be your teacher.
Oh, the new one.
You've also got an earring,
I see.
But isn't that what girls wear?
On the right.
Guys wear it on the left.
Ah... guys.
Vincenzino, tell me what it's like in Corzano.
Corzano?
Just Iook around you.
The streets are all busted.
The houses are smashed from the earthquake.
All there is is garbage and junkies' needles.
Every Sunday, you know what my father says?
"What the hell are we doing in this shit-hole?
Let's go to Naples."
So we dress up and go to Naples.
But when we come home, it's still Corzano.
See those guys there?
They're all crooks.
They think they own Corzano.
So I tell 'em...
"Keep this town, and its alleys and garbage!" Right?
Yes.
You know what else?
Talking of garbage, every morning... my classmate, Tommasina, rolls in garbage before class.
Then she comes to school and infects us with wigs.
Wigs?
Yeah, wigs... wigs!
Oh, lice!
Excuse me!
My suitcase!
You've made a mistake!
That's my suitcase!
Professor Sperelli!
I sent her.
She works for the rooming house.
Bring the professor's suitcase to his room.
Take it upstairs.
The view is spectacuIar.
A nice, inexpensive room, right?
It's beautiful.
Anything you need... just let us know.
You've brought that in. Good.
One small change, please.
Could we move the desk to have it face the light?
- Cecchina, come here.
- I'll heIp.
Let's move the desk so that it faces the light.
Careful. There.
Near the wall.
One moment. There.
That's it.
I'm sorry. It's a little heavy.
This way--
The bed.
He's too big to pass through.
We'll move the bed.
And the bookcase?
The bed'll go here, the bookcase there.
But then his feet-- lt's bad Iuck!
My feet?
Bad luck!
Your wife might cheat on you.
Please, don't let the girl think that.
I've been divorced for years.
But how did you know about that?
About what?
My wife running off with the dentist.
Oh, God!
I didn't mean about your wife.
You didn't?
This was for the evil eye, not your wife.
Are you superstitious?
No, not at all.
In Naples, if you sleep with your feet toward the door... it means you'll Ieave--
Feet first.
Feet first?
Like in a coffin.
I see. I haven't learned all the local customs yet.
Michele, did you bring the mozzarella?
I don't understand what she said.
It's Aunt Esterina.
She's in perfect health.
She just gets a littIe foggy sometimes.
Foggy...
Ah, Aunt Esterina, he's not Michele.
What do you mean he's not Michele?
Michele, what are you supposed to bring to your wife?
Mozzarella.
Mozzarella.
Good boy! Mozzarella!
Don't forget.
She's always dramatizing,
Aunt Esterina.
Michele is dead.
He dropped dead 15 years ago.
Michele's dead.
Get that into your head!
Corzano!
Excuse me, kids.
Where's the principaI?
Come in, Mr. Sperelli.
I'm Mimi, the janitor.
The principal is out. It's not absenteeism. She has lots to do.
It's politics.
Her husband's a councilman.
Sign here. Right here. Go on.
What is this?
It means you arrived today... and are starting work and all that. Sign.
But this paper is blank.
I'll fill it in later, when there's time.
If you don't trust me, don't sign. Who gives a shit!
Could you give me an attendance book?
Sure! Soon as I find it.
I don't see it.
I understand.
Bring it to my class, please.
We got ourselves a grouchy professor.
Look at that guy. What a nut!
This is the third grade.
Good morning, Maestro.
Good morning.
But there's nobody here.
You knew the teacher was coming today, right?
Sure.
How many are in this class?
About fourteen, sixteen.
Fourteen, sixteen--
What's your name?
Rosinella.
What's your name?
I'm Marco Tulio Sperelli.
Excuse me. Who is responsibIe for getting the kids to school?
Obviously not you.
I get it.
You stay here.
Don't leave the classroom.
- Let's go!
- What a pain!
- Where you goin'?
- For a brioche.
You'll get even fatter.
You're such a ball breaker.
We'll find those kids, one by one.
- We?
- Yes. Come aIong.
Mimi, where are you going?
Where's my brioche?
Stay in the classroom.
Sure, but it's brioche time.
You see?
I have to take care of the kids.
You also sell brioches?
Why shouldn't I?
This one is used to his morning brioche.
I have to think of the students.
I have a lot to do.
Don't waste my time,
Professor Sperelli.
I have a responsible position here.
I have lots to do.
Excuse me.
Is she the cleaning lady?
Yes. She's also my wife.
- And she's working?
- Sure, she's working!
The principal is working, you're working... the cleaning woman works, the kids work, everyone works.
And they say in the South nobody works!
You all work frenetically here!
Who is he kidding?
Let's go. Time for school.
I'm working.
To school!
Let me go!
Don Muchè, this teacher stiff s draggin' me off my gig!
You can't even speak properly.
You're coming to school.
Now, where do the others work?
There's the barber.
Vincenzino, where the hell you going?
To school!
Moano's book rated every guy who slept with her.
She said De Crescenzo was the loudest.
Giuseppe Scarano?
- Come with me.
- I didn't do nothin'!
- Who are you?
- How dare you?
He's lathering me up.
Where are you taking him?
Have you heard of compulsory schoollng?
Or of child labor laws?
Don't interfere, or I'll go to the mayor.
He is the mayor.
Wait. The man is absolutely right.
With closed eyes, I didn't realize a minor lathered me up.
Shame on you for making a boy work.
You're the new teacher from up north, right?
I'm Antonio Ruoppolo,
Mayor of Corzano.
Are you a third grader at De Amicis school?
- Let's go to school.
- I can't! I can't!
Marlboro, Merit, Marlboro.
Who smokes?
Marlboro, Merit, Marlboro.
Who smokes?
Let's go. Business is closed.
Off to school.
Let me go!
No stories!
To school, I said!
Let me go!
I don't give a fuck about school.
I got a responsibllity. I work!
Work? You call that work? Black market cigarettes aren't work!
- He smuggles.
- Fuck you. Spies!
Off to school.
Buy tangerines!
Who's this new teacher? Him?
You should be glad to go to school.
You call that a school?
It's disgusting!
It's old, broken down, with holes in the walls.
Careful. Stop.
I'll let you pass.
Those guys will run you over.
Let's go over here.
The boys pee in the sink... and clog up the toilets.
The principal won't go in there.
Ah, of course.
She don't give a shit.
Hey, guys, everyone knows the real boss is Mimi, the janitor.
Yes! He's really in charge.
He's a rotten son of a con man.
He's a Mafioso... and everyone's afraid of him.
Our school is hell.
It's called "Filthy De Amicis."
Poor De Amicis... filthy?
De Amicis was a great educator, a writer. He wrote "The Heart."
Let's go to school.
Let's go study.
Let's go. Here's the school.
Come here!
Toto, come here!
I'll catch you!
Why are you laughing?
Let's go to school. Come on.
Stop! Stop!
You go in the corner, you in that corner and face the wall.
You're starting off shamefully.
What are you doing?
I'm eating.
You ate a brioche an hour ago.
It's time for the second brioche.
A second brioche!
Put it away!
You should never overeat.
Or you'll end up like him and like the teacher.
Look at the nails. Disgusting!
Let's see them.
Rule number two:
Come to class with... clean nails.
Now... who knows this man behind me?
- That man is a caveman, right?
- Exactly.
If I lived in the Stone Age,
I could club people.
They clubbed people?
Sure. They'd meet people on the street, didn't say hello.
Just pow, pow!
And they'd beat them.
In those days, families always fought and they were all dirty.
They didn't wash or comb their hair or shave.
Even women didn't shave.
Do women shave now?
They shave their legs.
Even a newborn baby was a caveman right away.
They didn't have heat or television.
There was nothing for them to do... so they drew doodles on the walls.
Doodles?
Yes, doodles.
What does that mean?
Scribbles. Nonsense.
Dirty pictures.
I get it: prehistoric graffiti.
Man started to be intelligent... but he still looked like a monkey.
When they stopped looking like monkeys, they became Egyptians.
- Teacher, can I say something?
- Go ahead.
I can't tell the others.
Just you.
- Why?
- It's intimate and personal.
Come here.
Intimate and personal.
Your nails are dirty, too.
But I won't tell anyone.
I promise.
Now go back to your seat.
Look at him sleeping.
School isn't for sleeping.
- What is his name?
- Gennaro.
Mr. Gennaro? Wake up!
You're in school, facing your teacher.
Nice to meet you.
Stand up.
Go on out.
You'll keep standing the rest of the day... as punishment.
Go, if you have to.
What are you doing?
Oh, eating!
He's eating. Is it time for the third brioche?
Go to the blackboard. Let's see how much math you remember.
Hurry. Take the chalk.
We have to buy it from Mimi.
Chalk is school property.
Mimi, the janitor, sells it for 500 lire.
It's true.
I toId you to go. Go on.
It's the big one.
What?
The big one! Number two!
She has to poop!
Then hurry up!
I haven't got the 50 lire for toilet paper.
I'll come along.
You stay here and behave yourselves.
-The usual five sheets?
-No. It's diarrhea. A flat rate.
12 sheets for 100, plus chalk, comes to 600 lire... but you're new, so make it 500.
I'll pay 600.
No flat rate.
Help!
Let's go. Hurry!
We can make it.
We're almost there.
Here we are.
I'll wait out here.
Oh, God! Teacher!
My zipper broke!
I can't hoId it!
Wait. If you're not ashamed,
I'll help you. I won't look.
Who cares?
I'm shitting in my pants!
There.
What are you doing to that girl?
I'm doing what you should be doing.
Too late!
Wait. Damn! Now please clean her up, at least.
Me?
Who else? Me?
But, Professor, if Mimi, the janitor... didn't sell toilet paper by the piece, we'd be in deep trouble.
The State sends us nothing.
But you're perfectly right.
And thanks for gathering the kids from work.
I can't do it every day.
Sure, but it set a good example.
Let's hope so.
About the toilet paper and the chalk.
We'll write a nice letter to the Board of Education and I'll sign it.
Actually, it's better if you sign it.
You have guardian angels.
Excuse me. I don't really understand what you're saying.
Professor... Professor... there are atlIeast
500 Neapolitan teachers... who'd kill to have your job at De Amicis.
I'm at De Amicis, as you call it, only by accident.
It was a bureaucratic error.
You understand?
My assignment was to be Corsano, near my home, not Corzano.
Corzano, Corsano, with an "S."
I knew it.
It just means your guardian angel made a small mistake.
But you have a guardian angel.
You go too far!
Relax, Sperelli.
Don't get bent out of shape.
You're all red.
What's the big deal?
I mustn't get upset. Do you want me to have a premature birth?
There he is now.
My husband, the stud of Seville!
He's given me six kids in ten years of marriage.
Now that's fertile!
Please assure my colleagues who want my job... that I've requested a transfer.
Within a month or six weeks...
I'll be happily back up north.
So, happily, Professor Sperelli.
You're just passing through and you want to... fix all the troubles in the South in a few weeks... starting with De Amicis?
Even you can't pronounce
De AmEEcis properly!
Who says so?
I do. Everyone does.
No, Sperelli.
Here we all say De Amicis.
Get used to it, Professor.
Try to fit in.
You want to change too many things.
Good day, Reverend.
Don Gabrielluccio, why don't you turn around?
The view is so beautifuI.
There's the sea.
I've already seen it.
I understand.
"Gennarino Esposito,
Composition.
"My house and discussions.
"My house is all cracked.
cracked ceilings...
"cracked walls...
"cracked floors.
"Sometimes I feel cracked, too.
My mother says."
The Third World doesn't even have cracked houses.
"So we shouldn't complain.
"The Third World
is more Third than us.
"At Easter time, my father
brings home a lamb to slaughter.
"But we always feel sorry for it
and we end up keeping it.
And then my parents fight.
My mother says."
Mother of God!
Another fucking lamb!
Every fucking year these lambs!
You never have the guts to slaughter them!
I'll slaughter you!
"My father is a junk man.
"Mornings he has another job.
He comes back in the afternoons.
"He sleeps a little, eats...
"and collects
cardboard boxes at night.
Many times I go along with him."
That's why you sleep in class... because you work at night.
Now I feel badly.
I scolded you and made you stand up all day.
Don't worry.
I can also sleep standing up.
Why are you here?
Hello.
How much do you weigh?
What? Well--
Okay, I'll tell you.
I weigh 95 kilos.
And you?
I'm a mess, too... 51 kilos.
You need to be patient.
At my age, what were you like?
Me? Like this. Look.
Like that?
Exactly.
That's even worse than Mama said.
What did Mama say?
If I keep eating like this,
I'll get fat like you.
Thanks.
That's really very encouraging.
Are you on any diet?
What kind of diet do you mean?
The Jockey's Diet, Scarsdale,
Weight Watchers.
You're a regular diet expert!
More or less.
Do you diet?
No, because at home we eat normal.
Really?
Pasta and beans in octopus broth.
Octopus with olives and capers.
Meat soup, stew, vermicelli with garlic and oil... pork, innards, peas, eggs.
Pizza with meatballs and sausage. Little pizzas.
Persimmons, pears, cherries, dates and melons.
I'm getting hungry.
And for desert:
Baba, eclairs... eclairs with chocolate and cream... pastries, elephant ears, zeppole... delicious Sicilian cannoli... sfogilatelle, struffoll and rococo!
That would be normal meals?
Yes, but not all in one day.
We'd have broken pipes.
You mean a broken esophagus.
At least you don't wear an earring.
'Course I do!
Oh, God! I was ripped off.
Wait! Come here!
Wait. You look better without the earring.
I'm talking as one who knows about such things.
Aren't you coming?
- You're going to Toto's house?
- Yes, let's go.
What's wrong?
Toto thinks I'm your spy.
What do you mean, "spy"?
Do you all consider me your enemy?
- Spy!
- Fuck your ancestors!
You see? Didn't I tell you?
Here's what we'll do.
Order yourself an ice cream... and tell Vincenzino the teacher's paying.
Isn't ice cream fattening?
We'll start dieting another time.
Okay.
You're Toto's sister?
Where's your mother?
She's working.
- Your father?
- Over there.
Is he Ill?
No! He's drunk.
Who are you?
I'm the teacher.
And this is Toto's jacket.
Yes. Who knows who he stole it from.
Exactly.
The milk... turn it off, please.
I must discuss this boy with someone.
Talk to me.
To you? But--
I'm in charge here.
Could you pour the milk in the bottle? Otherwise it cools off.
We-- This morning
Toto ran away from me... left me holding his jacket and didn't come to school.
You realize he's a little too lively.
Lively? He's a delinquent, a good-for-nothing!
- Do you mind?
- What?
Feed the baby.
Excuse me.
What a beauty!
Here, beauty.
But getting back to Toto...
I think he must return to school... above all to get him off the street. You understand?
I don't want to undermine your authority.
I know you're in charge.
But I wouId like to speak with your father.
Right now my father's head isn't working.
Don't worry. Tomorrow morning, when he wakes up, I'll tell him.
What's wrong with the baby?
She's hungry.
Wait a minute.
What's her name?
Excuse me.
What's her name?
- Nanarella.
- Nanarella.
Your little sister-- Wait.
Be good.
Is her mama coming soon?
20,000 lire?
Nicola said, "The maestro is paying." It was an open order.
I said I'd pay for him, not for everyone.
Why should I be paying?
Should I be paying?
Who's the asshole buying ices for the whole third grade?
I am.
Oh, sorry.
Enjoy it.
Let him go!
What happened?
Damn your ancestors!
What a mess!
Leave him alone, Salvatore.
You're a drunkard!
I'll fix you!
You ain't gonna be a disgrace like me! Get it?
Get your ass in school!
You're always drunk! Always!
He won't be a disgrace like me!
Did you drink some bad wine this morning?
Get going, you disgrace!
Are you nuts? Leave the kid alone.
He's not a soccer ball.
Fuck off, junk man!
Lousy manners!
Get moving!
What d'you want?
A guy's gotta be a good father!
Fuck you!
Good morning.
I said good morning.
Sit down.
Why are you still standing?
Thanks to you, I can't sit.
Good job, Maestro!
You got his ass whipped!
They sent you from the North!
You busted balls the moment you got here.
Quiet.
I don't like you.
But thanks to that whipping... for the first time
I have an almost complete class.
What's your name?
Salvatore.
No. Tell me your last name.
Salvatore.
Salvatore isn't enough.
You must have a last name.
I don't remember my last name.
Gennaro's snoring.
Let him sleep.
He worked all night, poor kid.
I'm going back to work tomorrow, too.
Me, too. We need the money.
You say schooI is mandatory.
They pay you to come to school.
But who pays us? Nobody!
My dad's out of work.
They're all mad at you.
I know. I know.
Go to your seat.
That's enough.
Let's start the lesson.
Do any of you live on a street named after a famous person?
I live on the Via Garibaldi.
Garibaldi was the hero of both worlds.
He doesn't live on Via Garibaldi.
He's slinging shit!
He's slinging what?
He's lying.
He lives on Three Chicken Road.
Fine, but I want to hear about Garibaldi anyway.
Toto!
You're here?
They kicked me all the way here.
We took on that job, damn it!
Don't blame me.
Come on, shithead, walk!
Who are you?
I'm Mister Raffaele Aiello.
Mark me present.
The truck's waiting. Move it!
You, stop. Stay there.
"Mark me present"?!
Come in and close the door.
You've got some nerve!
I'm talking intelligently with one of my men... and you're crushing my cantaloupes.
What did you say?
You're smashing them--
-How do you explain cantaloupes?
-Balls!
How dare you? Get out!
I go when I want to go.
Out, you Illiterate!
You wouldn't dare.
You know, I spat in the other teacher's face... but I'll smash your face into the wall!
I won't let you! You understand?
I'm sorry.
I don't know how it couId have happened... but his face was... so full of hatred... like an aduIt... like a vuIgar delinquent, like--
Like a Mafioso.
That's for sure. This is the South, not Switzerland.
Kids like that force your hand.
I'm an educator.
All my life I've taught the philosophy of nonviolence.
Now I've hit an eight-year-old boy.
You must help me and report me to the School Board.
You should have me expelled, to set an example.
We'd have to report every teacher... every mother, every father... grandparents, uncles, one and all.
When I was young and in school... my teacher used to hit me.
My father smacked me... and my mother whacked all eight of us kids.
And I still turned out fine.
You turned out fine.
You turned out very badly.
I don't like you.
You know why?
Because your philosophy is at the root of all that's wrong in here!
- You don't like me?
- No.
I like you even less!
You're an impotent, presumptuous racist... with friends in high places.
Oh, I'm a racist?
A racist. Underneath, you're just a racist.
This is no place for you.
This is trench warfare.
It's a war here in the South.
These kids have brass balls!
And the teachers should also have them.
That slap was the best thing you've done since you got here!
Now the class wllI respect you!
Did you like what I did?
The teacher has earned your respect.
But how? By slapping one of your classmates.
You see, you now admire me... for something for which you should not respect me.
Because respect gained by force... today with a slap and tomorrow... with a revolver or a machine gun, that's not respect.
It's shame.
And it may be the cause of all the trouble in the South.
Violence is shameful in a civilized being... especially in a teacher.
I'm going home.
I don't feel well.
Anyway, I'm only here temporarily.
I don't expect to be well until I receive my transfer.
Good luck.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Have you really decided to Ieave?
Yes.
The doorbell. Who could it be at this hour? Excuse me.
Go ahead.
Michele... excuse me.
Are you angry with me?
Certainly not.
I'm a little distracted.
It's your student's mother.
Should I throw her out?
Professor,
I'm Raffaele Aiello's mama.
I have to talk to that person.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Aiello?
Please, sit down.
Watch the baby.
Do you realize?
- What?
- In our house.
What?
He's bringing women to his room!
I'm very sorry about hitting your son this morning.
I'm 45 years oId.
My husband was crippled in a shootout with customs offlcers.
I have four kids.
The oldest is called Rosario.
You know where he was until last week?
At Filangeri.
The correctional institution.
But I was happier knowing he was there... because there he wouldn't get shot.
Raffaele is the second... and he's following the same road.
When I heard... that you picked up the kids house to house...
I thanked the Holy Mother.
Now I hear you're abandoning the school.
No, no. Absolutely no.
For me, you're the last hope.
I brought you a basket of eggs.
You think life is like this?
A step forward, a step back?
Life is a ball breaker, my dear.
Is he coming?
Go see. Run!
He said he won't come, and he won't come.
- He's here!
- Sit and be quiet!
Good morning, Maestro.
Sit down.
As you see, I'm feellng better and I've come back.
Let's forget what happened yesterday.
But I see that someone didn't forget.
I'm happy to see that
RaffaeIe is also in class today.
This object, which is meant... as a vendetta against me... is human excrement in a cylindrical and squashed shape.
It is an important part of the life cycIe... just like butterflies, flowers, twinkles and stars.
Feces... have inspired many jokes and amusing stories.
They've also inspired famous writers and poets... like Dante, Boccaccio and other Neapolitan writers.
I'd like to read you something from this book.
Listen to these grandiose verses.
"Shit...
"On the street, by the sun's ray lit...
"A fly sings you a lullaby...
"So s;eep in peace...
Oh, noble shit."
Are you talking to me?
No.
"To the Board of Education.
"I, Marco Tulio Sperelli...
"am hereby withdrawing
my request for a transfer.
"I wish to remain
in my current position...
"as third-grade instructor...
at De Amicis
in Corzano, Naples. "
"Rain. My composition.
"If Jesus didn't send rain, there would be problems.
"The plants would droop, the trees wouId wilt...
"the earth would be parched, animals wouId croak.
I'd croak and so would everybody else."
A shit-load of dead stuff.
"Water is God's gift, but in Calabria it doesn't rain in the season."
Which season?
- The season.
- There are four seasons.
Yes. Autumn, winter, spring and the season.
You mean summer.
Why do you call it "the season"?
Because it's the nicest.
Not nasty like now.
You don't know whether to take a walk outdoors or inside.
Winter's okay for the rich, but for the poor, it's awful.
She doesn't give a fuck.
Her house has heat!
Is it my fault that my father works... and that I'm a material girl?
In the season, my father puts his clothes in the fridge... so they smell fresh.
Be brave, Nicola.
Off with the pants!
Have some pity!
Yesterday, did you really... buy a stereo cassette pIayer in Naples?
How did you know?
And instead of the stereo, you found a brick in the box?
Two bricks.
They made a fool of you!
How could you let them?
Even the Japanese don't fall for that!
Not even the Germans.
Not even the Milanese!
That's just about everyone.
Even the janitor?
Sit down.
- What'll you do?
- How do you mean?
You should get back at him!
Should I tell the police?
What would you do?
No, wait a minute.
Talk one at a time!
I'd say,
"I'll kick your whore mother!"
I'd tell that shithead,
"Fuck your dead ancestors!"
"Your old lady does it with dogs!" I'd say.
I'd bang his head 50 times!
I'd stick it up his ass!
And up his mother's twat!
Oh, my God!
I'd crack his fat ass.
I'd grab him and say,
"Your mother is a fart jockey!"
- Enough!
- Then I'd sing:
"Your father's ass smells like a zoo.
"Your sister's tits need glue.
"Sailors pay a buck to give your mama a screw.
Cops like her, too.
Their balls turn blue."
Enough vulgarities.
We'll continue our lesson.
How many months are there in each season?
January, February and March, but not all, and December... are winter months.
Some of March, Aprll, May and some of June... are spring months.
Some of June, July, August and some of September... are summer months, and all the rest are autumn.
Professor, she'll talk forever!
It's ten after one!
Why didn't the bell ring?
Professor, I'm starving!
All right, put away your books.
- What are we waiting for?
- The bell.
- Where's the janitor?
- On the phone, as usual.
Is it raining?
A drizzle.
A drizzle.
Let's go before it starts to pour.
Not before Mimi rings the bell.
It's 1:15. The kids are hungry.
ShouId I ring the bell?
You'll have to deal with that maniac!
No problem.
Go ahead.
Go on. Leave.
Let's go, too.
Excuse me.
Stop! Stop! Where are you going?
Who dared do this?
Who rang the bell?
Come right back inside!
Nobody leaves this school before I ring the bell.
I'm in charge. Who was it?
Who dared to ring the bell?
I did. So what?
Oh, yeah? I knew it, Professor!
This is my job.
You're the teacher. You teach!
Come on. Everybody inside!
He insulted you!
Call him a fart jockey!
Why didn't you ring the bell on time?
Why? Because, that's why!
Inside, kid!
- Call him a fart jockey!
- Say it!
Enough clowning around.
Let's go.
You're making trouble!
Wait. Excuse me.
What's going on?
This man is upsetting the discipline... and he doesn't respect my position.
Enough of this nonsense.
Madame Principal, permit us to leave.
You stop the nonsense, Sperelli.
No Northerner is gonna tell me what to do!
Call him a fart jockey!
Will you call him a fart jockey?
I'll teach this fart jockey teacher a lesson!
You see?
He got you!
I goofed!
"SwitzerIand."
She wrote a composition about Switzerland.
Her Uncle Pasquale came from there.
"Switzerland faces Switzerland,
Italy, Germany...
"Switzerland and Austria.
"Switzerland sells weapons to the whole world...
"so they can kill each other off.
"But the Swiss won't even fight a small war.
"They use that money to build banks...
"but not good banks.
"Banks for bad guys and for druggies.
"Sicilian and
Chinese delinquents...
"deposit millions in there.
"The police go and say,
'Whose money is this?'
"The bank says:
'That's our fucking business.
The bank is closed!"'
"But it isn't closed.
"It's open.
"In Naples, if you have cancer, you die.
"But if you go to Switzerland, you die later or you might live.
"Their hospitals are the most beautiful.
"Carpets, flowers, polished stairs...
"not even one rat.
It's so expensive that only crooks can afford to go there."
End of composition.
That composition's really dangerous.
If the immigration people hear it, they'll deport us.
This is her first Christmas.
She's beautiful.
- How's her fever?
- It's gone.
What did she have?
Nothing. A touch of measles.
What's your temperature?
102. Put it there, please.
What did that baby have?
A touch of measles.
Esterina, it's not carnival time.
It's New Year's Eve, and the professor is sick.
Let's bring him chamomile tea, and then we'll ceIebrate.
"Tommasina Rocco.
Composition.'Being Sick.
"When I get sick, it's trouble
for the whole house.
The doctor who visits me
isn't too good."
Let's hope the turd knows what he's doing.
"'Let's hope the turd
knows what he's doing'...
"says my father.
"But he doesn't know
and gives me the wrong medicine.
"Often he mistakes
one sickness for another...
"and after five or six days,
I'm as sick as before...
if not worse. "
To the souls of all your dead ancestors!
I should spit in Dr. Nicolella's face!
"The first doctor
is called Dr. Nicolella.
"The second one is Dr. Arnone
and he gets 100,000 lire.
"My father hasn't got the money
for the second doctor...
"and has to go into debt.
"When the second doctor arrives...
"he's not like the first one...
"who acts without
knowing anything.
"The whole family trembles.
Giuseppe pees.
"The doctor says nothing.
"Nothing.
He examines me quietly.
"He is very tall.
"He seems dead.
When he talks...
"he scares the shit out of me.
"But he always guesses
the right illness.
"When he leaves...
"my father curses the Madonna
and breaks everything.
And I cry in bed
because it's all my fault. "
Very good, Tommasina!
Dr. Nicolella. Dear God!
I'm sorry to call you so late.
A high fever.
It's probably a touch of the measles.
Good evening.
- You're Doctor--
- Nicolella, at your service.
What happened?
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Call Giovanni. Tell him they arrested me. I need a lawyer.
Damn it!
That's my brother, assholes!
Buy mimosas! It's March 8!
Let me have four more, please.
Four more.
For Lucietta... for Flora...
Tommasina...
Rosinella.
Thank you.
I brought these to celebrate
March 8, Ladies' Day.
You're whistling? You know why we celebrate Ladies' Day?
I think women shouId be equal to men.
Otherwise it's not fair.
They're equal on March 8.
Only on March 8?
No, not you!
Today you and I are dieting.
We'll eat again tomorrow afternoon. All right?
Mother of God!
Be brave.
Please, one at a time.
Take it easy.
Salvatore, at least today, tell me your last name.
Salvatore.
Not your first name.
Tell me your last name.
I've been asking you for four months--
Where's the last pastry?
- Huh?
- No "Huh"!
Put it back.
Confiscated!
Nobody gets it now.
Back to your seats.
Let's talk a little more seriously about Ladies' Day.
You bring women flowers, but you don't like women.
I don't?
You're unmarried.
You have no chlldren.
So, you must be a faggot.
What?
Faggot!
He's no faggot.
How dare you!
Why get mad?
What's the big deal?
My uncle in NapIes is a fag.
He's very nice.
I'm sure he is.
I'm straight, and I am married.
Oh, you see? He's married.
And where's your wife?
My wife left.
Sure, because you're a faggot!
No, because we're divorced.
She had a problem.
She always wanted to be right.
Let's drop the subject... and get back to our lesson.
You have two hours to write your answers.
Now...
A woman...
Are you writing this?
...goes to the market.
She has 10,000 lire.
- You're flnished already?
- Yes.
Can I ask you an intimate and confidential question?
Certainly.
If someone is divorced, can he remarry?
Yes.
All right, the two hours are up.
Please turn in your exercise books.
Recess time.
Don't get the wrong idea.
Let's split it and not tell.
That's Raffaele on the scooter.
Look how reckless!
Raffaele!
Stop being reckless!
Raffaele, riding a horse--
Are you idiots? When he's killed himself, will you be happy?
Whose bike?
His jailbird brother owned it.
He'd mug people with it.
What a delinquent. A bike, muggings, drugs, jail, cemetery!
A great career!
Why is it that in Naples lately, that's all you ever see on TV?
Once I watched a Madonna concert.
Then the TV broke, and I never got to see it.
Thinking about it makes me crazy.
I don't mean TV shows.
I mean news programs.
My father aIways watches dinnertime news.
Pasta, trouble!
Dessert, trouble!
When my father sees the word "Naples," he says...
"Be quiet. Let's see what new trouble there is.
Because they write 'Naples' just to tell us about troubles."
What you call troubles is peopIe getting killed on the street.
We in Corzano are better off.
We only have 8 deaths a year.
Well, then we can rest easy.
My grandma lives in Salvatore.
It's like a war zone there.
They'll kill you for anything there.
Why do you think these things happen?
The Mafia and drugs!
Ah, the Mafia and drugs.
It's a painful subject, but let's talk about it.
What do you know about drugs?
First it makes you happy.
Then you become an idiot.
One gram costs 10 million.
But all druggies are poor, so they steal... and mug people... and kill their parents.
You see lots of rainbow-colored butterflies... and you want to fly.
Then it's gone, and you only see Corzano.
What's going on? The motorbike broke. Please stop.
Hold it! I said stop!
Well, what happened?
I'm out of gas.
Will the bike fit on the roof?
Sure.
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Or are you ashamed to ride with us?
I had business in NapIes.
It's okay.
Queen Maria Carolina was the sister of Marie Antoinette.
You remember
Marie Antoinette?
The one in the French RevoIution.
They chopped off her head.
- They were right!
- They were jeaIous, like you.
You think the French RevoIution was caused only by jealousy?
And because Queen Marie
Antoinette had a good life.
She got up at five past noon... had breakfast with cappuccino and cake... washed her face, nalls and the bidet... and bought loads of dresses and jewelry.
So people got mad.
She got on all their nerves.
So they started the French Revolution.
They pummeled each other and spat in each others' faces.
Then they invented the guillotine... and chopped off everyone's head.
Chop, chop, chop!
I know everyone says it's wrong... but it's right: men are not equal.
Some are handsome, some ugly, some tall, some short.
Some are smart; some are dopes.
There's real men and shitheads.
And there are different nationalities.
For instance,
I hate the Germans...
'cause they're always starting wars.
I hate the British... because they think they're better than anybody.
I hate the French... because they're always making wine wars against us.
So you hate just about everybody.
I only like Italy.
Actually, just half of it.
I hate Northerners because they treat us like animals.
Yes, like animals.
If someone drops a piece of paper in Milan... they say he's from Naples, without knowing if he is.
I know he's from Naples, but how do they know?
Now, my dear Neapolitans... you'll pick up all the litter and cans.
Otherwise I'll hate you all.
During the Easter vacation,
I want you each to... write a composition about any parable you choose.
Raffaeie, come here.
- Why don't you write one too?
- No.
Go on... just to see how you write.
Ya got here and now you're in my face.
I don't understand.
That's Arabic.
You're being too pushy.
He should write about the parable of the lost sheep.
Shithead!
Write about lost sheep yasself.
I didn't even want to come along!
Enough! Let's go.
Damn it to hell!
Look at this.
His gasoline leaked all over!
The little bastard!
You said you were out of gas!
Just look! A broken gas cap!
He didn't really want to come along. He ran out of fuel.
The lost sheep!
You should have come with us.
Why be ashamed of that?
Let me go!
Stop it!
You gonna slap me again?
- Raffaele!
- You'll pay for this!
Where are you going?
Is Moses' Ark a parable?
It's Noah's Ark, dummy!
He embraced that mummy and said:
"Lazarus, I forgive you this time... but if you die again,
I'll beat you up."
Good for Lazarus!
Happy Easter, Maestro.
Professor Sperelli, a letter for you.
Good evening, Professor.
Did you all enjoy yourselves?
Weren't you sick today?
You should have come aIong.
I was money sick.
Papa doesn't have any.
But... why didn't you tell me?
I'd have given it to you.
It's okay. Next time.
All right, next time.
When I'm big,
I want to earn piles of money.
So do I.
My papa says without dough, you can't do anything.
And then he makes a disgusting face at himself... in the mirror.
And I know that he wants to spit at himseIf.
And I feel sorry.
You shouldn't feel bad about your father. He's a good man.
See you tomorrow.
So long.
A beautiful evening.
I see that you, too, are enjoying... your wall.
I received a letter today.
Some bad news about my future here.
It's made me sad.
Well, that's life.
I shouIdn't take it so hard.
"At least there's the sun," as Neapolitans say.
We also say...
"Life is like the ladder in a chicken coop.
Short and shitty."
I understand.
Fine.
Thank you... for your comforting words.
I'm going to sleep.
Maestro!
Maestro, it's Raffaele Aiello.
My mama's sick. If she's not in the hospital soon, she'll die!
We'll have to call an ambulance.
Come on.
What is it?
Excuse me for disturbing you.
One of my pupils' mother is sick.
Can I call an ambulance?
I keep the hospital's number here in case of emergencies.
- Here it is.
- Thank you.
Calling the hospital is pointless! They won't come.
Be quiet. Let me do it.
They're in cahoots with the Mafia.
Hello, hospital?
We need an ambulance.
It's a matter of life and death!
He's sick?
In Corzano.
What do you mean there aren't any?
- Call a private ambulance?
- Forget it. They cost millions.
Excuse me. How much would that come to, more or less?
What?
A million two hundred thousand!
- Forget it.
- You're disgusting!
Taking advantage of people's pain!
You're in cahoots with the Mafia! I'll report you.
They hung up.
Naturally they hung up.
Let's get going!
I'll come with you.
Excuse me.
- We'll take my car.
- We can't.
- Why not?
- I punctured your tires.
What?
I punctured your tires, and I put sugar in the gas tank.
- Sugar?
- It fucks up the engine.
Damn it! Why?
Explain that to me!
For revenge. Remember how you made me look like shit?
Or did you forget?
Come on.
Now you don't want to help me!
I knew it! Fuck you!
Wait. I'm coming with you.
Wait!
I do want to help you.
How do we take her there?
I'll pinch a car, and you'll drive.
Pinch a car?
I steal it, and you drive.
Okay.
Oh, damn! I'm not insured.
Let's go!
Forget about that one.
- Why?
- I'll explain later. Come on!
- Look at those.
- These here?
Not so loud! We're stealing!
Sorry. I'm new at this.
Damn, they're all locked.
Raffaele, I'll look over there.
Raffaele.
I'll steal this one.
Let's steal this.
It's convenient and has a stick shift.
What the fuck?
You wanna steal Half Ear's van?
- What's going on?
- Yes. I can explain it to you.
Raffaele.
We were lucky.
Half Ear is a friend.
You see? There still are some good people around.
Sure. He's a black marketeer.
Sorry, Mrs. Annunziata.
This road's very bumpy.
Never mind, Half Ear.
I'm so grateful to you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you all.
Help me.
Take the cigar box from under her head.
This cigarette carton is softer.
She'll be more comfortabIe.
I ruined your car, and you're not even mad.
Revenge for what?
What did I do to you?
Before, they used to respect me.
You made me lose face in front of everybody.
I did?
You want to ruin my life and change me.
You want me to be like you.
But I want to be a man.
I don't wanna care for anybody.
Listen, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
There's a sick woman.
Please get a stretcher.
Wait. An orderly wllI be coming.
A good-looking girI--
Mama's in bad shape.
Where are the orderlies?
- They're busy.
- Busy.
What do you mean, busy?
Can't you call them, please?
I'll call them.
Hey, asshole, get a stretcher now, or I'll slaughter you!
- But I'm a nurse.
- Now you're an orderly!
All right.
You don't have to get excited.
She's in pain!
The nurse will give her a shot.
Can't you see the problems we have here? Be patient!
The nurse will come to give her a shot.
Nurses?
They fuck all night long!
They fuck?
They fuck, fuck, fuck.
And they don't give a fuck.
This pIace is filthy.
There are roaches in the beds, but the raghead is the worst.
What?
The raghead. The nun.
The sister.
When she walks, everybody trembles.
If I met her on the street,
I'd run her over.
Here you're better off dead.
Mama! Mama!
Where's her shot?
Hold on, kid.
How dare you!
If Half Ear were here, she'd already have her shot.
What's going on? Quiet!
Why's this kid here? Out! Scram!
Ugly, bratty bitch!
Give this woman a shot now!
Or will you wait until she dies?
You ugly raghead!
All right, calm down!
You're crazy!
Get that injection ready.
- I'm sorry.
- You were better than Half Ear.
How is she?
Don't worry.
The worst is over.
Please.
Go haul ass an git th' 6:15.
Aunt's cumin'.
You understand?
Not a word.
You'd better leave, or you'll miss the 6:15 bus.
My aunt is coming.
Okay, but when your mother wakes up... tell her I owe her a basket of eggs.
How come?
She gave them to me so I'd get you back to school... and off the streets.
But now I won't be able to earn them.
I'm being transferred.
I'm going back up north.
Jesus! For real?
Jesus. For real.
Although you don't want to admit it... you were beginning to change.
Me? You got some nerve!
You're changing!
How?
You stole a van.
You smacked a nun against a wall.
Two more weeks with me, and you'd learn how to live.
Then it's really time for me to leave.
Look here.
- Two nice color photos.
- Can I sign it?
Yes, you should all sign it.
And write a lot.
Thank you. Staying with you was like being at home.
Professor... if you get lonely among those mountains... come back here.
Okay.
You'll marry Esterina, eh?
A good idea.
There's her husband's pension, my pension, yours--
- We like you a lot.
- Teacher.
These are our compositions about parables.
Read them on the train.
No, no.
Give them to the new teacher.
Please, behave yourseIves with him.
For Easter, send me a postcard.
You know the address.
Sure. We have to send you the car with a new engine.
It'll be ready in 15 days.
I'll never forget you, not even when you're dead.
Teacher, can we write to you?
Yes, but in your best handwriting.
If I write, will you answer?
Yes.
You promise?
I promise.
Teacher.
Salvatore...
Sco-gna-mi-gllo.
Very good!
Professor, this is for you.
It's a man's earring.
It's made of gold!
We all chipped in.
Except Tommasina.
But I--
I'll wear it now, okay?
No?
The left!
The right's for... faggots!
Oh, yes.
Raffaele didn't come?
You can't leave without seeing this beauty!
I haven't seen you in school recently.
I've been on maternity leave.
- I know.
- Well?
Well--
Professor, you finally managed to go back up north.
I did?
It's you who sent me away.
- We? No, you!
- You!
No, not us! You did!
You did. Anyway, good evening.
My regards to the stud of Seville.
Same to your sister!
Your mama's a fart jockey.
Good for you, Professor.
Have a good trip. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
This is for you.
What's in here?
My composition. I tried.
Good for you.
School is bad, but you're not.
Michele, hurry back.
Please come back soon!
I'll come back, and I'll bring mozzarella!
Composition.'
My favorite parable...
is about the end of the world.
It doesn't scare me since I'll
already be dead a whole century.
God will divide everybody...
to the right and to the left.
Those in the center
will go to Purgatory.
There'll be millions... more
than there are Chinese people.
There will be three doors.'
A huge one for hell...
a medium one for Purgatory...
and a tiny one for Heaven.
Then God will say,
"Silence, all of you. "
And then he'll divide everyone.
One here, another one there.
If any smartasses
try to switch doors...
God will see them and say,
"Hey, where you goin'?"
The Earth will explode.
The stars will explode.
The sky will explode. Corzano
will be in a thousand pieces.
The good will laugh,
and the bad will cry.
Those in Purgatory will laugh
a little and cry a little.
The babies
will turn into butterflies.
Me, let's hope I make it.
The curse of God on you!
God bless him.
Isn't he great for his age?
Miss Grubb, you bold thing, you're taking us home.
It's the third Sunday, the day for the cemetery.
I know. I thought you might like to pick up Master Godfrey.
Godfrey is not next or near the house.
Jesus!
He's at the dentist.
You have the height of luck,
Mr. Doyle-Counihan.
Sunday dinnertime... many a professional man might be intemperate.
Now, local anesthetic.
I got it at the local.
Mr. Clancy, suddenly I feel a lot...
That's what they all say.
When you think of it... this is the only place in the world... where toothache is unknown.
Open up now, sir.
Think of your mammy's lovely house burning to the ground.
- Huh?
- That's the stuff.
- Now, identification parade.
- Uhh!
You'll tell me when I get warm, won't you?
- Fair dues now.
- Ohh.
Aah! Aah!
Are you sure?
We're on the pig's back... so I won't need to pull that bugger.
It'll walk out.
Still, no sense in discouraging business.
Ohh...
- Hold still now.
- Aah!
- How's the mammy?
- Mmm.
Fresh and well she's looking.
The woman, I always say, is born for widowhood.
It is her natural vocation.
The woman is incomplete until himself is six feet under.
Aah!
Who are you telling?
You, sir, are, as yet, a youngish man... but you may have noticed... that no sooner does a widow leave off wearing her weeds... than people are never done telling her how ravaging... how ravishing she looks.
Would you say, now, that is why your own mammy... having been twice bereaved... is ahead of the field in the beauty stakes?
No one's going to tell me
I don't disinfect.
I dote on women, so I do.
I could look at them until the cows came home.
Mr. Doyle-Counihan,
I would not, at this minute... be putting you through the agony of the damned... except that the first
I set foot in this town...
I saw her...
Miss Katherine O'Hare... a jewel, a skylark in the hen house.
She's as poor as Job's ass in a town that's as rich as God.
She has the smallest house... and the sweetest smile on Widows' Peak.
There's a secret about her, would you say?
Where does she fit in?
If you know, don't, whatever you do, tell me.
I like a woman with a bit of mystery.
Oh, the first day
I clapped eyes on that one...
I made up my mind.
If she ends up as anyone's widow, it'll be as mine... or I'll swing for her.
Aah!
I have good news for you.
Back that at a hundred to eight, you bollocks, you.
Ladies, that'll do.
Enough's enough.
We don't want to spoil them.
Uhh!
Oh, Mrs. Lacey, no getting morbid.
If you please, ladies.
It's a busy day for us.
Anything stirring, Miss Grubb?
It's Clancy the dentist.
He's calling on Miss O'Hare.
Oh, show.
It's too late. They've gone in.
The silly woman.
You'd think she'd had enough of that sort of carry-on.
I do hear tell he is overly fond of his jar.
He's a man. That's enough.
- What, dear?
- I said he takes the snuff.
Oh.
Good morning, Miss O'Hare.
I hope I didn't hunt your visitor.
Oh, Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, not at all.
Mr. Clancy was just admiring my roses.
Sure, why wouldn't he?
Would you like a jaunt?
- Excuse me?
- Get in next to me.
"Sure, where's the harm," says you, "in a bit of style?"
How are you, ma'am?
People do pay me compliments on my roses.
I do tell them there's not a ha'p'orth of skill involved.
A weenie bit of loving care, maybe.
Mind, I'll own up to it.
I wouldn't mind one day to grow a rose of my own.
- And you will, please God.
- I don't know.
But if I ever do,
I'll call it the Widows' Peak.
You'll what?
In honor of our little kingdom and how snug we are in it.
My dear,
I hope you'll do no such thing.
Widows' Peak?
That's the name used by all the jealous boots in the town.
Miss Grubb, slow down.
It's the Lucy girl.
The poor creature.
What poor?
Now, we gave her every chance, so we did.
Get it adopted, we said to her.
But, no, she'd sooner make a show of herself and of us.
Where will she go?
Where do you think she'll go?
Why else did God in his goodness invent England?
A new rose, now that'll be nice for you.
And, of course, it means you won't be leaving us.
Is it me?
For gracious sake, why would I want to leave?
Now, aren't people scandalous?
The way they talk, I mean, about yourself and Mr. Clancy.
About...
Corner-boy gossip.
But don't mind it.
The word is, he's popped the question.
Hello. Hello.
- The question?
- One question or the other.
Excuse me?
And we all know what the other is.
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan...
Mr. Clancy is a gentleman through and through.
He would never dream...
Miss O'Hare, do you see the green in my eye?
Now, listen here.
You know me of an old date... and I'm not one to rub vinegar into a cut... but it doesn't do to have too short a memory.
I mean, we don't want that carry-on a second time.
- Once bitten...
- Yes!
And a woman of your years...
Has the man no decorum?
So it's true, then?
Old Mrs. Melody's cottage has been sold.
Now, there's another excitement.
Well, I'm too old a dog to act in breach of my instructions.
Your revered mother...
R.I.P... laid down the terms under which property on Widow's... on the hill may be leased... no children under adulthood, no males of any kind... except in the case of your son Master Godfrey... and no married or single ladies... unless by exceptional consent of the residents.
In short, ma'am, all is well.
Oh, rather, the new owner of Melody Cottage... is, unhappily, a widow.
Unhappily.
And, what is more, a war widow... or, at least, a postwar widow.
Her husband,
Major Broome, V. C... recently died of wounds received in 1918.
Will you go to God? A V.C.?
Do you mean...
Are you saying he was in the English army?
No, he was with the Germans.
Wait till word gets out.
And do you mean that that man's wife is coming here?
If you please, Miss O'Hare,
I'm talking.
Now, I can't say
I'm partial to military men.
They have a coarseness
I can do without... but a medal now is different... especially when it's from what they call...
For valor?
Posthumous, I was going to say.
Posthumous is nice.
And his wife?
There are no children?
You're certain?
The lady is a bird alone.
In fact, she should be flying in just anytime now.
Shit!
Hey!
Damn it.
Oh, my...
Had a puncture?
No, my car threw me.
Let me give you a hand.
- Ha ha.
- Ha ha, yourself.
Thanks, but don't you think... you might get dirt on that fancy dress of yours?
A few spots? Who cares?
The very thing.
Mrs. Broome, isn't that it?
Ten out of ten.
I saw the removals van.
I'm Godfrey Doyle-Counihan.
The mammy and I live up the hill from you.
- Up Widows' Peak.
- Widows'...
In Kilshannon, Mrs. Broome... widows are as plentiful as freckles on a redhead.
Maybe you knew that.
I came to Kilshannon for the climate.
What climate? We're in Ireland.
Was I misinformed?
Before you jack up the car... aren't you supposed to put a stone or a wedge... under the wheel to keep it from...
Mrs. Broome, would you say... that I'm doing you a small favor right now?
Don't tell me you want a favor in return.
Nothing of a disgusting nature.
Now, it's just that when you meet the mammy... and you will, don't let on to her that I can change a tire.
- Why?
- Well, God rest her... she thinks that I'm like the rest of the men, you know?
A bit helpless, bit of a namby-pamby.
You know what mammies are like.
So I put on an act for her.
I pretend
I'm helpless without her.
She'd never get over it... if she thought that I wasn't in the least bit helpless... that I could do things with my hands... like changing a tire.
Ahem.
I'll keep your secret.
Oh, look.
Are you in trouble?
Well, let's just say if I had a bad reputation... you're doing it the power of good.
Whoa! You've arrived.
Excuse us.
- I was married, you know.
- Yes.
And I still like a good stretch.
I'm sorry I can't offer you tea.
No teapot, no cups, no sugar, no cream, no tea.
I could, uh, light a fire.
A Boy Scout.
I'm sure you could.
Tell me, do you have a maid?
Not until now.
You'll need one.
Up here on the Peak... having someone in to polish your silver... marks the point where women leave off and ladies begin.
I don't make the rules.
The women do.
Or rather, the ladies.
And each one of them has a maid.
After you've been a widow for thirty or forty years... having a chaperone around the house... may not be a necessity, but it does wonders for the morale.
Mr. Doyle-Counihan,
I think you're a brat.
So let me give you a tip.
Out of the goodness of her heart... first thing the mammy will do is find you a maid... and ten to one, it'll be Mata Hari.
- Oh, yes?
- Maddie O'Hara, that is.
During the recent Troubles...
Dublin Castle had an intelligence network... that was only legendary.
Maddie would knock them the lot of them into a cocked hat.
The sorrowful fact is that where Mata Hari is concerned... there is no such place as no man's land.
- How many times?
- Fourteen, Canon.
She takes the front line with her as she goes.
- Was he married?
- My sister's husband, Canon.
Oh, dear, dear God.
Did you take pleasure in it?
I... I didn't mind.
Oh, dear, dear, dear God.
Trot out the details.
Spare me nothing.
So, Mrs. Broome, tell this poor admirer...
Is that what you are?
What brought a beautiful woman like you... to maybe end up on
Widows' Peak?
Truthfully.
When we're better acquainted.
Bargain.
There, that'll put a bit of warmth into you.
It's taking nicely.
It'll be roaring in no time.
Well, I'll love you and leave you then, so.
Oh, and remember, next time you see me with herself... don't let on to her that I'm such a handyman.
Mammy's the word.
Aha! Good luck now.
See you soon.
I can't wait.
Is this Mrs. Broome that's in it?
Yes. Hello.
I'm Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
What way are you?
God bless you, you're as welcome here as rain in a drought.
Thank you, I...
Creature, you, what are you doing... sitting where the people from the town sit?
Move down with us.
Yes, you will. Now, up you get.
No, really, I...
Now, don't be shy.
There's buckets of room.
Now, I say you will.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Thank you, but, really,
I was quite comfortable.
- It's not the thing.
- What?
We keep separate from the townies.
We don't mix, dear.
That's the custom.
Well, at least, some of us don't.
Miss O'Hare, make room.
There's a good woman.
Now, down you sit.
Isn't it a massive film?
I do hear tell you see God in the second half.
Miss Grubb, have you anything sweets?
So, tell, how are you settling in?
Yeah, no, wait.
Where is my manners?
Mrs. Broome, this is Miss O'Hare.
Oh, butter wouldn't melt, but a great character.
How do you do?
Ah, Miss Grubb... why are you tempting me, you bold strap, you?
Will I, won't I?
Will I, will I, will I?
I'll introduce you to the other ladies back at the house.
We're all going there for tea after the film.
Now, what was I asking you?
Oh, yes. Are you settled in?
I think so. It was a bit confusing to begin with.
The pace is so different in Ireland.
But I'm beginning to get the hang of it.
But you're not English after all.
Pardon me?
What I mean is, your accent is American, isn't it?
Oh, Lord, is it so noticeable?
Yes, well, I grew up in America, in Washington.
My father was military attache at the embassy there.
- Oh.
- The British embassy, that is.
Ah... grand.
Here comes God.
Thank you.
Then after the war...
I... I went to France... to visit Nigel's... my husband's grave.
I suppose one might call it a pilgrimage.
And they gave him a medal?
A what? The V.C., yes.
And I couldn't bring myself to go back to England... not to live there on my own.
We hadn't been blessed with children.
So I went south, to the Riviera.
I took a house at Antibes.
I was there seven years, since 1919.
And then I left, and here I am.
And where else would you want to live?
Nobody in their senses would live in France.
What made you decide to honor us, Mrs. Broome?
Don't tell me you were tired of the blue sea... and the palm trees and the sunshine.
No. No, in many ways,
I was sorry to leave.
But you did.
Miss O'Hare, you're being inquisitive.
If Mrs. Broome had a mind... to move out of one place and go live in another... isn't it her own affair?
Ladies, amn't I right?
- Yes.
- Of course.
I enjoyed living in the south of France.
There's no secret why I left.
I... I had to.
And as I say, I didn't want to go back to England.
There were too many... painful memories.
You had to leave?
Well, I hardly like to say.
I'm sure.
You see...
It is Miss O'Hare, isn't it?
I had been married, and, uh... now I was a widow, and I was still... forgive me, quite young.
And my husband had seen to it... that I was not uncomfortably off.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
I left Antibes because... because of men.
Because of fortune hunters.
Oh, wasn't that woeful for you, you creature, you.
Well, it was probably time to go, in any case.
I missed hearing my own language spoken... and I missed the kind of climate... where you get snow and sunshine and rain and fog... all in one day.
And Nigel had often spoken so affectionately of Ireland.
He loved this country so.
He told me how he used to come here for the shooting.
Really?
What did he shoot... Irishmen?
Uh, Miss O'Hare, honest to God.
Why not? It isn't as if we're ever out of season.
Mrs. Broome, don't mind a bit of her.
Miss O'Hare has had family misfortunes.
- Oh, dear.
- Oh.
And even so, we don't talk about such low goings on... as wars and massacres and people getting shot.
No. We leave all that to the men... seeing as they're good for nothing else.
Would you say that includes
Englishmen as well?
Miss O'Hare, I think you've exceeded your allowance.
Anyway, the fighting and troubles and such... aren't they all behind us and in the past?
No.
Uh, another piece of sweet cake,
Mrs. Broome?
No, no refusals, no.
Yes, you will, just in your hand. Godfrey.
How wonderful it must be,
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan... to have a son who's so helpful.
Oh, Godfrey's a wonder.
We'd be lost without him.
He's the only man here who's worth his salt.
A man? God forgive you,
Dolores Furlong.
She wants to put ideas into his head.
He's all I have, Mrs. Broome.
Oh, go on. You're an old cod.
Still, the mammy and I are great pals.
Oh, how lovely.
Are you in business,
Mr. Doyle-Counihan?
Godfrey.
I do have a profession, yes... the law.
But I don't practice much these days.
There's too many little jobs to be done around the house.
Oh, poor Godfrey.
Sure, he tries.
I'm sure.
That reminds me,
I'll be needing a housemaid... and I was wondering if you might...
With a heart and a half.
In fact, there was one woman
I heard about... who sounds like a pearl beyond price.
What was her name?
Oh, yes. Maddie O'Hara.
Oh, dear.
So, what do you think?
About the widow?
Well, would you not say you could do a lot worse?
Fortune hunters she ran away from.
You could be well-matched.
Oh, son, put away your toy.
Your mammy's talking.
I'm not one of those mothers... that thinks they can hold on to a son down all eternity.
Oh, you'll go from me someday,
I know that.
So, now, what do you think of her?
Now, Mammy, stop it.
No matchmaking.
I'll decide whether
I like Mrs. Broome or not.
You wasteful child, you.
What do you think Mammy is for?
Why do you think there's nothing but all divorces... in America and England?
Because people choose for themselves, that's why.
It's scandalous.
I think I'll call upon her
Saturday afternoon... and ask her to go for a stroll by the lake.
You do. Do.
And pretend you're as good as ten carpenters.
Yes. Make yourself useful.
Yeah.
A widow. That's good.
She knows what there is to know... and her stomach would have been turned by it.
She'll have learned her lesson.
She won't harm a hair of you.
I have made inquiries in the neighborhood... and really, Miss O'Hara...
Or Maddie.
May I call you Maddie?
You sound like absolute perfection.
Nothing but the highest praise, a treasure.
Oh, heavens,
I shouldn't have said that.
Now you'll want more money.
Well, let's not quibble.
Shall we say... whatever you were getting at your last place... plus five shillings a week?
I do, however, have two firm rules... that we must agree on from the start.
The first is no gossiping.
I will not have what happens... or is said in this house talked about.
Gossip? Is it me?
Oh, no, no.
Please, I wasn't for a moment suggesting that...
I swear on the grave of my mother that's dead and gone...
It isn't necessary.
If a word of gossiping or carrying stories... ever passed my lips or ever will pass them... may I be put sitting on the hottest hob in purgatory... and may I splutter steam...
Please, I...
Until Good Friday falls on a Saturday.
Maddie... Miss O'Hara...
I was merely stating a little rule of mine.
The fact is, everyone
I've spoken to in Kilshannon... agrees that they haven't heard... one word of scandal pass your lips.
They what?
They say one could as soon get gossip... out of the old town hall clock.
- Excuse me?
- And as for the other rule...
I can't abide doors or drawers or cupboards... that are under lock and key.
It's a little fetish of mine.
I like everything open and accessible... so of course I do need a person such as yourself... who... who doesn't pry... who respects the privacy of her employer.
Is that too eccentric on my part?
I'm dead. That's what it is.
I've died and gone to heaven.
- Good evening.
- You're ready.
Guess what. I've had an idea.
- You... you look...
- Oh, good.
I thought, as you've been so kind... as to take pity on a lady who's all alone...
I thought, why not make the most... of its being Saturday night... and instead of a walk, why not a dance?
Good God.
Whenever Nigel was on leave... we'd go dancing every evening and all at the Savoy.
People nicknamed us the Castles.
You've heard of them?
Vernon and Irene Castle from America.
Oh, well, the fact is...
Oh, don't tell me there's no place we can go.
I have a car.
I can drive us into Limerick.
Well, the fact is that around here... unless there's a party or a hunt ball...
Don't tell me there isn't any.
- Well...
- No music at all?
- Well, yeah...
- Good. Let's go.
Yes, but you have to be a certain...
Maddie, I'll be back before midnight.
If my luck runs out.
You don't get my drift.
This is not the kind of dancing that you... Oh!
This place we're going to...
Katy Daly's.
Who did you say?
It's what it's called.
I ought to warn you, it isn't exactly the Savoy in London.
For heaven's sake,
Godfrey Doyle-Counihan... don't you think
I can make allowances?
Potted palms, four old ladies... a harp, a violin, a piano, and a cello.
Who cares?
Con. Mr. Clancy.
How in the world do you do that?
It's the same as pulling teeth, only in reverse.
That woman... she's that peculiar friend of your mother's.
Miss O'Hare.
She oughtn't be here no more than us.
Mind you, she's mad.
She doesn't like the English much, does she?
I don't know why the mammy and the other old dears... bother to bid her the time of day.
They're such snobs, and she's poor as a church mouse.
Yes, why is that?
Have you ever thought to ask?
I did once.
I said to the mammy...
"What's the secret?
"What is this hold that Miss O'Hare has over you?"
And do you know what she said?
"Ask me no questions, child, and I'll tell you no"...
Oh. It's over.
Stay out of the ditches.
Good evening, Miss O'H...
Cold for the time of year, isn't it?
And now, ladies and gentlemen... the next dance will be an old-time waltz.
Ladies' choice.
And for this dance... the special spot prize will be two tickets... for the premiere performance of that great film...
"The Big Parade," starring John Gilbert.
Ladies' choice.
Does ladies' choice mean that I'm supposed...
Hey, mister, would you be on for a dance?
Uh, I'd... I'd, uh, I'd be delighted.
Jesus, I'm made for life.
Would you like to?
I was ready to slash my wrists.
Shall we?
Lovely orchestra, isn't it?
Do you come here often?
Terribly jolly, isn't it?
Jesus.
Now, now, now.
Everybody stay where ye are.
Don't move a muscle!
Off you go, Mrs. Fogerty.
Take five paces forward:
Over here!
Not a jig out of anyone!
One, two, three, four, five.
Are you there, Mrs. Fogerty?
I am.
OK. So now, um, turn right!
Take three paces!
One, two, three.
Yes?
Now, now, now, turn left.
Take six paces!
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Yes?
And now, last of all, and for the prize... turn left again.
Oh. Something disgusting stuck on my shoe.
And take two short paces!
One, two.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I lost my balance.
Have we a winner?
- We have!
- Excuse me.
Come back here!
There ye are.
And the great style of ya!
Who deserves it better?
I deserve it better!
That woman pushed me.
- Oh, Katherine.
- With all her strength.
Pushed you?
I did no such thing.
That's a lie.
How dare you.
I fell against you accidentally.
Yeah, to be sure you did.
The same your lot have been falling against us... for 700 years, accidentally.
I see.
I'll take that, if you please.
You will not.
While there's breath in my body, you will not.
- Kindly let go.
- Katherine, give it to her.
No!
Miss O'Hare, I have no desire for a public quarrel... least of all in public.
As far as this prize is concerned...
- You're welcome to it.
- Thank you.
Just as soon as you own up... that I did not push you deliberately.
Ha!
Katherine,
Katherine, just leave it.
Hey, Mossie, you're slipping.
You ought to dance with a better class of mot.
Huh?
That one would take the pennies off a corpse's eyes.
Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
Hey, hey, hey!
No rowdyism!
That's mine.
Then take them.
If women don't want them tickets, I do!
Ooh, Con, what's happening?
You should know. You started it.
Can you not do something?
Sure, if one of them needs a dentist.
Ohh!
I'm new here.
I don't know that woman.
I've never done her any harm, and yet she hates me.
Why?
Because you're English.
Is that the reason, really?
No.
Mrs. Broome...
Edwina.
Edwina.
Did you really bump into Miss O'Hare by accident?
Of course.
Well, good night. Thank you.
Most of it was lovely.
Thank you.
And I really enjoyed the drive.
Perhaps next week we could, uh...
Come for tea on Monday.
We'll talk about it.
Oh! By the way... the mammy wants you to sit on the Ladies' Committee.
It's to do with town planning and things like that.
It's as dull as a wet Good Friday.
I'll think about it.
I wouldn't if I were you.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, why did you ignore my advice about Mata Hari?
Don't you know that your private life... will become knowledgeable throughout... the length and breadth of the twenty-six counties?
I don't mind in the least.
I don't have any secrets.
Good night.
Good night.
If you'll excuse me saying so, dear... dance halls are for people not like us.
Now, I don't blame you, not a bit.
You're English.
You have no idea about social distinctions.
Miss O'Hare was at the dance.
Yes, well...
She's one of... us.
She is, and she isn't.
She's half and half.
What has she got against me?
I've tried to be friendly, but it's war to the knife. Why?
Why, why?
"Y" is a crooked letter, pet.
- What does that mean?
- I haven't the remotest.
Why don't you have a talk with her?
Yeah, be nice.
- I have been nice.
- Be nicer.
Put yourself in the right and her in the wrong.
Oh, there's Godfrey!
Mammy! Ha ha!
Coo-ee!
She wins prizes for her roses... every year at the Adare flower show.
Tell her how you never saw the likes of them.
Miss O'Hare.
Maddie, I'd like to talk to Miss O'Hare... privately, if you don't mind.
I brought you a peace offering.
It's just some fruit from my garden.
I have no use for it really.
The fruit, I mean, not the garden.
Miss O'Hare, don't you think... we could at least talk like grownups?
If I've done anything to offend you...
I promise you that it simply wasn't intended.
I knew in my heart it was no use coming here... but at least I tried.
If we're not friends, it's by your choice, not mine.
Good-bye.
Would you look at the face of her?
What ails the woman?
What badness is in her?
Is there any rhyme or reason to it?
I don't know.
She's rude and hateful... and there's no reason to it.
No!
Ma'am, them's the ones for the flower show.
She said,
"I brought you a gift. "
Next.
Ladies, are you coming in, or aren't you?
And then you know what happened?
She went over to the prize rose bush... and she broke two of them off and threw them on the ground.
This is a likely spot.
- For what?
- A proposal.
How did you know?
My late husband proposed to me in the Lake District.
He believed water was romantic.
Your own mother's never done saying... that all men are alike, so...
Well, in that case, it should be... like marrying the same man twice.
I came here to be rid of men.
Fortune hunters.
That excludes me.
We have pots of money, and so have you.
Otherwise you wouldn't be huntable.
There are those who would say we were well matched.
Including your mammy?
Especially the mammy.
You want to be rid of men?
Marry one.
I don't like idlers.
I'll go back to the law.
I don't like lawyers.
They consort with criminals.
No, they don't.
They consort with other lawyers.
That's what I said.
Isn't there some family business... selling bottled mineral water from the spa?
Yes. That's how we made our money... but the well dried up years ago.
Then import some water.
Better still, use ordinary water... and whatever makes it taste disgusting.
My God, you're as crooked as any lawyer.
Aren't I just?
When I receive your proposal,
I'll consider it.
Meanwhile, it's customary... to provide a sample of goods on offer.
Um...
Who's going to provide the sample?
Think of it as mutual.
Tit for tat.
Bloody fool!
What do you mean, fool?
That's my car!
Stop it!
Aah!
You say the woman on the bicycle was too far off... to identify as Miss O'Hare?
Well, allow me, if you'll pardon the expression, to mark your card, ma'am.
Even if you could identify her, and it was Miss O'Hare... there's not a shred of evidence... to say that she tampered with your motor car.
Then who else could have done it?
That's not a question a judge would put to a jury... especially not if the jury and the defendant was Irish... and the plaintiff was English.
It was she. I know it was.
Ma'am, I have a son in Trinity College... and a wife who says that without a fur coat... she'll die of pneumonia... so I could do with a fat lawsuit that would last a week.
I could assure it tomorrow against Miss O'Hare.
Then do it.
You'd lose... and the Irish are a litigious race.
She'd bring a countersuit against you... and the upshot would be... that she'd never need to take a lodger ever again.
A lodger?
Aye. The poor thing hasn't
2 ha'pennies to rub together... so from June to September, she rents out a room.
No. If you sue Miss O'Hare... you'll be backing the wrong horse.
She's too well liked.
Then what am I to do?
There's no end to her malice.
She's called me a thief in public.
My car was almost wrecked.
What next?
She's a harmless soul... a relic of old decency.
Between ourselves and these four walls... what did you do to her?
Own up.
Nothing. Well, not really.
Anyway, she started it.
It's because I'm English.
Are you codding me?
Mr. Gaffney, I see no humor...
Because you're English?
Yes. For some reason... she loathes and detests anyone who...
And who do you think her lodgers are?
Tourists on holiday... from London and Liverpool and Birmingham.
They come back year after year... because no landlady has ever made them... feel so much at home as Miss O'Hare does.
She hates you because you're English?
Come on, now.
You'll have to do better than that for a yarn.
Ma'am! Ma'am!
It's on the wall.
What?
What are you talking about?
Oh, ma'am, what's writ on it.
Writ? What do you mean, writ?
You mean written?
Written where?
The one thing I won't be is a hindrance.
Seeing as the regatta's upon us...
I'll do my bit, same as always.
The Ladies' Committee won't even know I'm gone.
Ah, will we not?
You think so?
And you, you'd throw away 30 years.
Now, change your mind.
Yes, you will.
If that woman is on the committee...
But she lives here.
She's entitled to be on it, as you are.
Katherine, it's not too late.
Now, what began as a quarrel is turning into a scandal.
There's talk of graffiti.
I know nothing about that.
And her motorcar won't be mended for a month.
Oh, she's clever.
I'll give her that.
It's all my doing.
Poor Miss O'Hare that's gone astray in the head.
It's all to be laid at my door.
And she's you fooled as well.
Me? How?
The car and the paint... and what happened at the dance.
Don't you see that she's the one behind it all?
It's part of what she's been up to.
And what's that when it's at home?
I think it's to do away with me.
To...
Because she knows
I can see through her.
I gave myself away... the first time
I clapped eyes on her.
Maybe she credits me with being smarter than I am... but at least
I know a gold ring... from the brass one you'd find in a sweet cake on Halloween.
A gold ring?
I'm talking about her... about her not being what she pretends to be... and that's maybe why one of these dark nights... poor Miss O'Hare will walk into the lake in her madness.
- Into the...
- Don't you see it?
Are you blind?
She's up to murder.
Miss O'Hare.
Well, ma'am, did you talk her out of it?
Quite the opposite,
Mr. Clancy.
I think she's tired of slaving for the committee.
She ought to rest herself for a month or so.
Aye, with all my doors and windows locked.
Watch her.
- What?
- I said watch her.
She trusts you in her innocence.
I don't, not so far as I could throw you... or the whole seed and breed of youse.
But I'm telling you to look after her, to mind her.
What is it that ails her?
I don't know.
She has queer ideas.
Has it to do with the past?
What?
I mean before
I came to Kilshannon.
I know there was something... because, well, I'm fond of her.
And I ask her about how it was... the time she was growing up, about herself.
She won't answer me.
She looks out of the window or at the lake... but not at me.
So what is it?
I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Clancy.
There's nothing in the past.
Nothing.
Would you like a hot cup?
There you go!
There you go!
Easy now, son!
Not too quick!
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it! Easy, easy!
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on.
Take it easy. Not too quick.
Steady...
Go on, go on, go on.
There you go.
Oh, Con! I'll fall in!
Not a bit of you!
Hold on!
Hey! Come back!
What about me?
- Admiral.
- Good to see you.
Grand. You're here.
Well, come on.
We'll get aboard, huh?
Well, what's the rush?
Well, the rally's in Inishkeen... and the harbor's a little on the tiny side... so the boats that get there last... have to moor out on the lake.
Is that so bad?
Well, it's all right rowing ashore... but rowing back to the cruiser isn't.
Do you mean because of the currents on the lake?
No, I mean because of the pubs on the land.
- Mrs. Broome.
- Hello.
Right, everybody.
Let's get aboard.
Come along, Mammy.
Lend a hand, Miss Grubb.
What fun!
Right, Mammy.
Come on. Up you get.
Up, up, up. That's it.
I think I'd better go in the car.
No, no, no, you won't.
Come. Get in the boat.
- Oh, Godfrey!
- That's it. Stop it, now.
Up you get. Lovely.
Hands and shoulders up! Lovely.
I wouldn't go next to or near a boat... only the doctor told me
I needed exercise.
That's right.
That's it, Mammy. Down below.
What next?
I never dreamed. I had no idea.
- What?
- That Ireland was like this.
I'm so glad I came here.
It's perfect.
Almost perfect.
Well, the "almost" can be rectified.
Say you'll marry me.
On this lake and under this sky?
The gods would strike us dead for our impertinence. No.
I'll say it on dry land.
- You will?
- Godfrey!
Oh, that's all right.
The boat will steer itself.
Look, not a feather out of it.
You'll say yes then?
Today I'd say yes if Miss O'Hare invited me... to drink a glass of her own blackcurrant wine.
Not bad.
You'll do.
Yes, you'll definitely do.
Is that her up ahead... the old witch, Miss O'Hare?
Yes.
Oh!
Just hold the wheel lightly.
That's it. Gentle.
Be gentle. Just a touch.
Pretend she's a woman.
You say the loveliest things.
Godfrey, will Miss O'Hare get to... wherever it is we're going ahead of us?
Inishkeen.
We're faster, but they've got a head start.
If we opened her up, we could make it.
We could be first round
Hamilton Point... and then again, we might not.
Then open her up, my future husband.
Whoo!
Oh!
She gaining on us.
I think it's a race.
Godfrey, stupid child, put the brakes on!
Won't it go any faster?
There are too many small boats around.
It's considered bad form.
We're not going to overtake them.
There's not enough water between us and the point.
You're heading for the shallow!
Go back to the channel!
We've done it!
We'll be in first!
- Yes!
- Good girl yourself!
Better luck next year!
Ha ha!
Jesus, they're on top of us.
We're never going to overtake them.
There's no room!
Then they can very well move over.
Look, do you want to see them on a shoal?
Do I? Oh, heavens to Betsy, what a terrible idea.
Edwina! Throttle back!
Let go of me.
Oh!
Get over!
Aah!
- Get back!
- Aah!
Oh!
Did you see what he did?
- Tighten those sheets!
- Hold 'er steady.
Katherine, are you hurt?
Ohh...
I'm fine.
Are we sinking? I can't swim.
It won't be necessary.
One of the few advantages of going aground... is that you can walk ashore.
- Do you need a hand?
- Are you hurt?
Can you hold on?
There's boats coming!
Can I throw you a line?
No! Don't let him.
Don't let them come near us.
Don't worry, I won't.
What are you trying to do, son?
Tow us out into deep water so you can sink us properly?
Well, at least let me help you aboard!
No!
It's all right.
We won't want for rescuing.
If the weather holds... you'll be back on the lake inside of a month.
All you need is a denture and a bit of bridgework.
I'm sure.
What's a couple of cracked bicuspids?
You'll be sailing this boat till you're a hundred.
Another 80 years, what?
Miss O'Hare, can I just say that we... my family, that is, will gladly pay for the repairs.
There, now.
It was my fault entirely.
I shouldn't have let Edwina...
Mrs. Broome... take the wheel.
I don't suppose there's any point in asking... if it would be possible for her to say how sorry she is?
I mean, it would just make the day perfect for us... because we're actually going to announce... that we're going to be engaged.
Oh, well.
That's great news.
Engaged, what?
God send youse good luck.
What do you say, Katherine?
She completely lost her head.
Didn't know the rules of the river.
Don't pass on the right.
Pass on the right.
No, it was just high spirits and lack of river sense... so obviously, we wouldn't like anything to spoil our...
She tried to kill us.
What?
Murder was what I said.
And I was right.
Ah, woman, you're raving.
While we've been sitting here,
I worked it out.
What she'd a mind to do was to ram us in the midstream... where the water's 40 feet deep.
Are the pair of you blind?
Can't you see what was going on in that murderous brain of hers?
And she'll try it again.
As long as she's not found out, she'll go on trying.
All right, Con?
Is this seat taken?
- No, no. Quite all right.
- Thanks.
Whoo! Ha ha ha ha!
Absolutely fantastic!
I say!
I thought you said it was dead around here.
It must be one of them mirages.
You don't hear a mirage.
You see it, you hick.
I love men when they're witty.
Excuse me, dear madam... but might one inquire what the occasion is?
If it's public.
It's the regatta dance... for the regatta and the rally.
Excellent. And forgive me... but are there nonteetotal beverages available?
Not for the likes of them that's had enough.
I don't know you.
Go 'way from me.
We don't know him, either, missis.
We gave him a lift from outside Nenagh.
Permit me, ma'am.
First Lieutenant Rokesby... of His Majesty's ship "Heroic. "
Lads, will we go to the old dance? Say we will.
At your service, ma'am.
The fact is, I've had a somewhat checkered 24 hours.
Fell into bad company in Dublin last night... and missed my ship.
Courtesy visit, you know, not bombardment.
So I thought I'd catch up with it in Cork... and took the road to Limerick by mistake.
Going to be the devil to pay.
- That serves you right.
- I suppose it does.
- And the devil's cure to you.
- Well, thanks very much.
Hey, admiral.
Is someone calling?
- Hey, limey, are you coming in?
- Oh, yes, why not?
Lord knows where
I'm going to sleep tonight.
Oh, I say.
Are you going, too?
Good. I have a partner.
Go away from me. Go on.
Shoo. Shoo.
Drunken Englishman.
Thank you. Keep the change.
You came in. Grand.
How do you feel?
Are you all well in yourself?
Oh, yes. I think
I'd like to go home, actually.
Excuse me, most gracious lady.
But may I have the pleasure of this dance?
No, you may not. Go 'way.
One small circuit of the floor is all I crave... or at least to as far... as where they're serving refreshments.
Am I in my own country at all, or amn't I?
They're everywhere I go, tormenting me!
Can't you see you're annoying the lady?
- That'll do you now.
- Are you saying I offend her?
Not at all. It's just she's not in form for dancing.
If it's a drink you want, it's down there. Good lad.
So much for the friendly Irish.
To you.
Uhh!
Good God, it is!
It's you!
Well, I'm damned.
Excuse me?
You... here, of all places.
My God, they do say it's a small world.
I'm sorry.
I've never seen you before.
Yes, you have.
Don't talk gammon, old girl.
But where the devil was it?
And I've forgotten your name.
Wait. You tell me who I am.
You're mistaken.
I really don't know you.
Now, you're making a nuisance of yourself.
The lady doesn't know you.
Come on, Edwina.
Edwina?
No, no, that's not it.
Yes. Now I remember.
It was at Antibes.
We'd put in at Monaco for repairs, and you...
Oh, my God: Yes!
I don't believe it.
You, here, of all places.
How damn priceless.
I don't...
Godfrey, I need some fresh air.
Yes, but they're going to make the announcement about us.
Fine. Well, let them.
Yes, but we have to be here.
Everyone's going to applaud...
For Christ's sakes, Godfrey!
Do you have to be so childish?
Con!
Why don't you treat Mr...
- Rokesby, ma'am.
- Rokesby to a drink?
- Thanks very much.
- Sure.
And of hope and glory
We'll take Barney Murphy's horse and trap... and I'll be back to him inside the hour.
A few more steps and a good night's sleep... and you'll be as right as the rain.
I have no drink in the house.
- What?
- For him.
- He wants more drink?
- I want more drink.
Wha... what's going on?
Why are we here?
Be quiet.
Up you get.
Can you manage it?
Oh!
Splendid Irish hospitality.
Infinitely obliged!
Don't worry.
You'll sing for your supper.
- There you are.
- Right.
- You got the door open?
- No.
- Home already?
- Oh, yes.
All ashore that's going ashore!
You'll frighten the horses.
You'll frighten the neighbors.
Steady, now.
Home, sweet home.
Oh, God. Time for beddy-byes.
Oh, no, Mr. Rokesby, the night is still young.
You and I are going to have a little drink.
Just first tell me...
Just you and I, as snug as two bugs.
I don't like just driving off... and leaving you on your own with him for the whole night.
Oh, aren't you a gorgeous man?
You're jealous.
You're as good as a tonic.
No, I'll be safe with Mr. Rokesby.
Even when the English are murdering you... they're always pure gentlemen.
Well, if you're sure...
Good night, Con.
Good night, Katherine.
Good night, Maddie.
Good night, Miss...
Oh! Tsk!
Now, then...
I'll be your sweetheart
If you will be mine
Good evening, Maddie.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
Are these what you were looking for?
I suppose you remembered that you'd forgotten... to re-seal my letters after you'd steamed them open.
What? May God forgive you.
I never.
May I drop down dead.
- It's the weather.
- I beg your pardon?
Rain one minute, sun the next.
Sure nothing sticks.
I knew there was an explanation.
Glue is useless.
What a climate.
True for you. It's fierce.
Maddie...
I want to know... about that woman O'Hare.
About Miss O'Hare?
There's nothing.
She has no money.
What does she live on?
Why doesn't she live in town instead of here on the peak?
She's nobody.
Why do Mrs. Doyle-Counihan and the others... put up with her? Huh?
What makes her one of them?
Is it blackmail?
What does she know?
Nothing.
It's the ladies who...
The ladies who know?
Who know what?
It was...
Well?
It was agreed long ago.
It was a bargain they made with Miss O'Hare... that it would never be talked about.
No, nor mentioned. Not ever.
I see.
Well, you're going to talk about it now.
Good morn to you, Miss O'Hare.
Isn't that a grand class of a day?
Grand, thank God.
I haven't clapped eyes on you since the regatta.
Were you not well?
Oh, no, I...
I thought it might be dangerous to go out.
They say everyone's got a summer cold... the kind you can't get rid of.
Will you walk down with us, or will you take the bike?
Ah. I think
I'll go on shanks' mare.
The banns are called between
Godfrey Doyle... and Edwina Broome, both of this parish.
If anyone can show just cause... why this marriage should not take place... he or she should do so to His Lordship the bishop... or to any one of the priests of the parish.
This is the third and last time of calling.
- Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
- Canon.
Well, the church clerk hasn't come haring around... to say that somebody's ready to swear to it... that the groom-to-be is in the Freemasons... so I think we can safely use racing parlance... and say that the tapes are up.
And as for you, young man...
I've never known anyone born so fortunate.
When I look at this beautiful young woman...
Mrs. Broome!
Miss O'Hare.
I wouldn't know a bit of you.
Such a stranger you are these two weeks.
Ought I to offer my congratulations?
I'd be very pleased if you did.
In that case, I do.
Ah, God love you.
And I congratulate myself as well.
I walked to Mass.
Did you know that?
I didn't take my bicycle... because the brakes weren't working.
Really?
Such a steep hill.
Wasn't I blessed?
But what I really congratulate myself on... is that once you're married, you'll be safe... and no one can touch you... not me, not anyone.
And that means
I'll be safe as well.
So that's the height of good fortune... for the pair of us, wouldn't you say?
Canon.
Safe?
W - what's she talking about?
What does she mean by that?
I have no idea.
Ah, the creature.
Old maids are the same the world over.
The poor mind always gives way.
Will you come up, Canon, for a bite of dinner with us?
What is it, Con?
I hope you went to early Mass... because you're late for this one.
What's happened?
Someone put this through my letterbox.
Whoever wrote it doesn't put his name to it... but I'd like to know if it's true.
Read it.
It's short, but not what I'd call sweet.
Well?
Ohh...
C - con, th-this sort of thing...
Is it true?
A...
A long time ago... a girl...
A different person. She...
Con, you can't walk away.
You can't walk away.
Ohh...
Lunch, Mammy.
Dinner, Godfrey.
There's me own sister...
Sister Teresa Gonzaga from the Carmelites.
They let her out on condition she doesn't talk.
And there's me cousin
Mossy Cooney... who's in the government... and Godfrey's uncle on his father's side... who was a gunman in the Troubles... and is the ambassador to the Vatican now... and the commodore of the yacht club... that's had the stroke, but is coming in spite of it.
Oh, such a dinner!
It'll be the talk of the county.
Excuse me...
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, for interrupting your lunch.
Dinner.
It's a private occasion, pet.
I know that, so I won't take up your time.
This morning,
Con Clancy got a letter.
It said as how
I'd had a baby 30 years ago.
Uh, Miss O'Hare...
The baby's father was a soldier... out of the garrison in Limerick.
It was the oldest story in the world.
I was that innocent.
I believed him when he said... he was off to fight some foreign war... and when it was over, he'd send for me.
It was 1904,
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
Your own Godfrey wasn't even into long trousers.
I remember the salt tears you cried... begging me not to keep the baby like I wanted to... but to give it to strangers.
You promised that no one in the town... would ever mention it or think bad of me... that it would be looked after.
What I wanted was to have the child... and rear it and be a mother to it.
But yourself and the ladies... them that I still see every day around me... you said that for me to keep it... would be an insult to good-living women... to them that were well in with God.
So in the heel of the hunt...
I went to Dublin and had her adopted.
And youse kept your word,
I'll not deny it.
There was the little cottage, all for myself... not a penny rent to pay... and I was never looked down on... because I'd done what was right.
I suppose I reminded youse of how good youse were... and how Christian.
The baby died.
Did you know that?
What? Well, no.
How could I have known?
When she was three.
I thought to find out... what kind of people she'd gone to... and if they were good to her.
It took me a long while, but I managed it.
I'm a great finder out of things.
She'd been with a doctor and his wife.
Nice people.
Only there'd been scarlet fever where they lived.
I felt sorry for them.
So...
Oh, your lovely lunch is going cold on you.
So this morning,
Con Clancy got a letter.
And now he's done with me.
Maybe it comes from having... too high a regard for a person in the first place.
It's not them you can't forgive for being human.
It's yourself for being so foolish.
Well, my secret is out, and my race is run.
Con Clancy will die in his own bed... and me in mine.
You were foolish, too,
Mrs. Broome.
If you hadn't hated me enough to want to destroy me with this, then I wouldn't be here now... and you'd be getting married to himself there.
What am I saying?
You might even have finished... eating the food on the plate in front of you.
Are you saying that I wrote an anonymous letter?
I'm sorry, but this lady is not herself.
Did I mention that it was anonymous?
I don't think so.
But 'tis no matter.
'Tis the day for them, all the same.
For letters, I mean.
We'll be at least agreed on that score, Mrs. Broome.
That name isn't yours, but then, I don't know what is.
This letter is from
Mrs. Edwina Broome.
She lives in Scotland.
Her husband was Major Nigel Broome... who won the Victoria Cross.
The War Office sent me her address.
Isn't it grand to know... the English are good for something?
She says that you're an impostor... and if I were you, I'd go back where it was you came from... before she sets the law on you.
Edwina, tell her.
Tell her what?
You tried time and time again to harm me... but at Mass this morning,
I said, "I'll say nothing.
"Let her marry him and get her hands on his money. "
You?
"And more power to her. "
I don't know why.
Maybe I lack for poison inside me.
Then Con got that letter.
You were wrong about one thing.
I'm finishing my lunch.
It's lovely.
You went to so much trouble... leaving all those papers around... for Maddie O'Hara to spy through.
No wonder you wanted her as a maid.
She was your best character witness.
The mistake you made was taking the name of a real person.
If you hadn't done that... all I had was the word of that young Navy officer... that met you in the brothel in the south of France.
He said you could do more tricks than a conjuror.
Oh!
The holy sister, what she's trying to say...
She says she's going to faint.
That young officer said that thanks to you... the ship missed its maneuvers, but the crew didn't miss theirs.
Now, what did he mean by that?
He was being kind.
I remember him well.
He said he wanted to go around the world... and so I let him.
I don't think
I'll stay for pudding.
Good-bye, Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
It was magical.
- No!
- Godfrey.
- Godfrey.
- She's not to go.
I won't have it.
I won't let her.
Child, are you mad?
You have the cheek of you.
Now sit down and have your dinner.
- Lunch!
- Whatever! Sit!
I don't care what she's done or who she is.
I'm that fond of her.
Are you, Godfrey?
I said sit down!
I won't say good-bye to you,
Miss O'Hare.
We still have unfinished business.
That's the last we'll see of her.
Godfrey!
Miss Grubb!
Come here to me.
Mammy, what is it?
Miss O'Hare's boat. Look.
Oh, my God!
What are we going to do?
Yeah, the police!
Miss Grubb, get the police.
Tell them Miss O'Hare...
Oh, the saints protect her this day. Ohh.
Ahoy, there!
Is there anybody onboard?
Ahoy! Is anybody there?
Oh, thank heavens.
I've been on the lake all night.
I lost my sense of direction.
Stand by for a line.
Thanks.
Can you please tow me back to Kilshannon?
My car's still there.
Where's Miss O'Hare?
Is she below?
She was on the boat with you last evening... when it left its mooring.
Yes, she, uh... she got off.
- Got off?
- Got off?
Excuse me. Would you...
If you don't mind.
Am I speaking to the man from Limerick?
A man from Limerick, yes.
Chief Inspector Kilkelly.
Well, my name is
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan... and I saw the woman who's in there... going on to Miss O'Hare's boat.
And my son saw it, and Miss Grubb saw it.
And if I know the ladies on the hill... every one of them saw it.
- Yes, I saw it.
- I saw it, too.
Well, Sergeant, could you take the ladies... somewhere comfortable where they can make a statement?
There's not room in there to swing a crippen.
I tell you this.
If Miss O'Hare wasn't on that boat when it was found... then she was drowned off of it.
"I have business to finish with you yet. "
That's what that woman said.
And now we know the sort of black business it was.
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, we don't have to get excitable.
- I'm saying...
- Madam!
This crowd has their ears cocked for every word we say.
Now, let's not be reckless.
Well, let the police walk tippy-toes all they like... but I'm going to say what's true... and I won't put a tooth in it.
My friend, the friend of all of us here...
Katherine O'Hare... is at the bottom of the lake this minute... because that woman put her there.
And God forgive me...
Miss O'Hare said she was in danger... and I wouldn't believe her.
None of us believed her, not even me.
I was a Judas.
I turned my back on her.
And now there's been a murder done.
That's true.
It's been said at last.
- Murder.
- Did she say murder?
That woman murdered Miss O'Hare.
It's true. It's true.
She murdered her.
- Murder?
- Murder?
Broken-down pier, you say.
That'll be here. Kilgarven Quay.
Three miles to the nearest village.
Are you saying that Miss O'Hare left her vessel... and walked to a place where you wouldn't meet... an ass and cart in an hour's walk?
Yes. Why not?
Why not? Why should she?
Well, it was... I told you, we... we quarreled... and she said if I didn't get off the boat, she would.
Yet you were the one who remained onboard.
I told you, it was starting to rain.
Why should I walk out into a downpour?
Why should she?
Why should Miss O'Hare walk into a downpour?
Because she was stupid, that's why.
Was stupid, Mrs. Broome?
I... I was talking about yesterday.
But you do admit that when you went aboard the vessel... it was you who untied the mooring ropes.
I wanted to talk to her.
On a boat, a person can't very well walk away.
Right. Right over there.
That's it.
Bring the boats in, lads!
By God,
I think they've found her.
This bag and its contents... were found in the water off Kilgarven Quay.
It belongs... or belonged to Miss O'Hare.
These are her house keys.
Any idea how it came to be in the water?
She dropped it in the water as she got off the boat.
You didn't mention this previously.
Well... I forgot.
She just dropped her purse in the water... and made no attempt to retrieve it?
She was in a hurry.
She did say, "Oh, shit. "
Mrs. Broome... you are to be detained on a holding charge... of removing property, to wit, a motor cruiser... without the owner's permission.
You will be removed forthwith to Limerick Garda station... where a more serious charge may be preferred against you.
The... the door's opening.
Edwina! Edwina!
There's the murderess!
- Murderess!
- Edwina!
- Murderess!
- Edwina!
Murderess!
I was not in the least surprised... to find that the woman was a...
No, I won't say it.
But she tried to get her claws on my son.
And when poor Miss O'Hare... the Lord have mercy on her, got suspicious... well, that was her death warrant.
A woman, whom we took into our community... our homes, and our hearts.
And what was in her heart... a heart as black as it was English... but murder?
But I say to ye... in the name of our all-loving Savior... that murder will out.
Over there.
Right. Take her back, Jim.
Not much luck.
Let's move our sweep this side along the west.
Right there!
...of the murdered woman,
Miss O'Hare.
- Dear God!
- We will now proceed to sail... over the point where she was last seen.
I appreciate that since the Troubles... a good murder is hard to come by.
When one does come along... people want to make the most of it... but this is going too far.
And who the hell thinks he knows how to print a handbill?
And this woman, the lowest of the low... is charged with what?
With taking what belongs to someone else... and they call that a crime?
Ah, it isn't even a venial sin, not in this town.
And we have here today... none other than Mr. Comiskey... the Minister of Agriculture... representing the Minister of Justice... and still the police take no action.
They want, if you please, to find a dead body.
Yeah, a body.
Well, all I can say is they're very particular.
Good woman yourself!
Well, the people of Kilshannon demand justice.
Now you're talking!
We... we have had 700 years of English tyranny... and now let this meeting demand... the rope be on the other neck for a change.
Thank you, Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
And now let us say a decade of the Rosary... for the repose of the soul of a woman... who was a saint when she was with us... and, alas, is now a saint in earnest.
I take it there are no objections... from the committee... given the nonsacred nature of our surroundings.
- None at all, Canon.
- Fire away, fire away.
Mrs. Colgan?
One of the sorrowful mysteries.
- Mrs. Purdieu?
- By all means.
- Mrs. Lawless?
- Yes, yes, of course.
Miss O'Hare.
Miss O'Hare!
Oh, don't mind me.
Water. Get some water.
No. Power's Gold Label.
Such an aggravating young woman
I never met.
She came on to my boat and shanghaied me.
Now there's the town she knows something about.
She carried on about me making a show of her... in front of the Doyle-Counihans... and all belonging to them.
God almighty, for a strap of an Englishwoman... she'd talk the hind leg off a donkey.
So by the time we got to Kilgarven Quay...
I... I was so moidered...
- That you went ashore.
- I did.
I walked two miles in the pours of rain.
A cart from the creamery at Portumna gave me a lift... to my cousin Maggie's house at Terryglass... and it was the best day's outing
I ever had.
I'm going to live with her.
And why wouldn't I?
She's a widow and by herself, the same as I am.
I only came back to sell the boat... and pack up me bits and pieces... and look at the commotion
I've walked into.
Ha! They're gone... and sorra a body will shed a tear.
That Miss O'Hare...
I don't know.
I gave that woman... so much of me heart's blood over the years.
I'm glad to see the back of her.
And as for the other rip...
Did she turn you against women, son?
Only against her, Mammy.
Do you know, she actually asked me to go back to work.
Go along with you.
Pardon me.
Will you see Gaffney the lawyer?
I'm sure she will.
And it's Mr. Gaffney, by the way.
Do tell me.
And to what, Mr. Gaffney, do I owe the...
Pleasure, ma'am?
No pleasure at all.
Alas, business rather.
The business of
Mrs. Gaffney's new fur coat.
The man has drink took.
He has, yes, and will again shortly.
However, I was alluding, ma'am, to the prosperous time ahead.
To get to the nub of the matter,
I am instructed by my client... known to you as Mrs. Edwina Broome... to take action against yourself... the Reverend Canon Murtagh... and the ladies of your committee... singly and en masse... on the grounds of slander and criminal libel.
You what?
Now, now. Forgive me.
Did you and the ladies of Widows' Peak... not call my client a murderess?
Did you not give interviews to the papers?
Did you not personally print handbills... accusing her of a crime... that carries with it a sentence of death?
No. Those handbills were Maddie O'Hara.
No. All I did was...
Put her up to it.
Yes, I have that.
Dear me, it seems as if all of you conspired... to put a rope around my client's neck.
Having called the tune, you must pay the piper.
We'll do nothing of the sort.
The brazen nerve of her.
A woman that's a mockery to her s-e-x.
No better than a common...
I wouldn't repeat that if I were you... seeing as we only have
Miss O'Hare's word for it.
It's called hearsay... and, in any case, the judge will rule as inadmissible... any attack on my client's character.
The judge?
Oh, my God.
It's a good job you're comfortably off...
Mrs. Doyle-Counihan.
At least, unlike the other ladies... you will have a penny or two left.
Oh... oh, the rip.
Oh, the rip!
How dare she? Oh!
Now, now, now, woman.
None of your ullagoning.
You ought to go down on your benders and give thanks.
Haven't you a treasure that neither the plaintiff... nor any woman can take from you?
A treasure?
To be sure you have... the love of a good son.
Hasn't she, Master Godfrey?
Aye, a boy's affection for his mother.
All else will fade, but never that.
Godfrey!
Godfrey!
Godfrey!
Bye-bye, Mammy!
I'm free!
I'm free!
Help!
Help!
Help!

Ready for dinner, dear?
Oh...
Ah, lamb, what is it?
I told her. I warned her.
Gin will do it every time.
Oh, be quiet.
But what's wrong?
I just remembered when you told everyone... that the baby died of scarlet fever.
I actually believed it, and I still do.
Oh, no.
That's because I'm Irish, lovey.
We can never resist a nice sad story.
And don't remind me about Kilshannon.
It's on my conscience.
Why on earth should it be?
There are times... not all the time, sometimes... when I feel we were a bit hard on them.
Well, they were a bit hard on us... weren't they, Mother... thirty years ago?

I'm going to draw a dog on your cast.
I don't like it when they're all white.
I'll do the first drawing.
Mommy's in pretty bad shape.
The doctors think she may die.
Are we going home?
No, we're going to Claire's.
Will Mathias and Delphine be there?
Of course.
Will there be lions?
Mathias and Delphine are your cousins, not wild animals.
But will there be lions?
If there are, your Russian dog will protect you.
What are you doing?
Putting my head out of the window.
No no no no...
No.
If you went slower, I could do it.
I could go even faster, but I'm careful.
I didn't buckle you in so you see what it means to be careful.
Not like your stupid mother.
She's not stupid!
Was I driving?
She wasn't drunk.
She wasn't speeding.
She knew the road by heart.
What could she have been thinking with you in the car?
It wasn't on purpose.
It's not her fault.
Did you ever break your arm with me?
Or get hurt?
She's not stupid.
I'm not hurt.
- Are you okay up there?
- Yes.
- Will you make me a promise?
- Yes.
Never die.
Swear on it and spit.
And when we get really old?
I don't give a shit.
Spit and say: "I'll never die".
- I'll never die.
- Louder. I don't believe you.
I'll never die.
Spit!
Mommy is dead.
You know what that means?
Yes!
She's flying with her magic mirror.
She's dead!
I thought she'd be with us forever too.
I could act as stupid as I wanted.
I trusted her.
I knew you were with her.
Can I spit?
Can I spit... so you don't... die?
You think I'll manage to raise you alone?
Yeah, you'll manage.
You can do it.
She was all broken.
They couldn't fix her.
They couldn't.
I'll make us feel better, okay?
Yeah, I'd like that.
You have nothing for her?
I don't know.
- You don't know what to give her?
- No.
You can give her Yoyotte.
Not Yoyotte.
If you give her something you love, she'll know you love her.
No, I only love Yoyotte.
Yes!
They lock her in with screws.
They put her in the cemetery?
Yeah.
Sometimes they put them in hospitals. to get shots.
That didn't work this time.
She's going to heaven.
It's nice there.
Your mommy will like it there.
She can't come back.
If they bury her right, she can't come back.
Jesus can take her up there.
No.
Mom, can we put our presents in the box?
Can they put a few things inside?
Later on, she'll be able to come out.
No one can come out.
Only zombies can.
They put a heavy cross on you to keep you in.
You stay in there like a statue.
You can keep Yoyotte.
What's in there?
It's sand.
- Sand for dead people?
- Yeah.
To put around their tombs?
I think it's to bury them with.
I like living above ground.
I really hate skulls.
The man told me if you don't put a pillow inside, it's like she's in a tin can.
But if you put a pillow in there, your mommy will sleep for a long time.
Don't worry, your mommy has a pillow.
She'll sleep for a long, long time.
Can I go to Lyon if I come back soon?
Yes.
I'll call you tonight and every night.
We'll talk about school, your shenanigans and all your cousins' mischief.
Okay, honey?
Here's Yoyotte.
No!
I didn't start the car yet. you never usually cry until later. until I start driving away.
If you cry,
I'll be sad all the way.
I'll try again, and you'll try not to cry, okay?
Okay.
I'm careful, I drive slowly.
Nothing can happen.
If you're scared, give me Yoyotte.
I'll give you something.
What?
I don't know.
My watch, my favourite thing.
You give me my favourite thing.
I'll give you Teddy.
Go get Teddy, then.
Thanks, honey. Here, put it in your pocket.
Claire will make a hole in the band.
Listen to the tic-toc.
Listen.
When you're sad, listen to it.
It's my heart beating.
Teddy will take care of you.
Yes, he'll protect me.
Give me a lovey-dovey kiss.
Come on!
Ponette, why aren't you dressed yet?
- I'm talking to my mommy.
- Why?
I feel like it.
Mommy came to play with me.
What do you say to her?
I ask where she lives.
She says in the sky, there are castles that are all different colours!
My castle, my mommy's, is red with a gold roof.
That's where the two of us live.
You live here. That's baloney!
At night I live with my mommy. and during the day I live here.
I like the night more.
Why are you mean to us?
Because you're mean to me.
No, we're nice.
Not about my mommy.
You didn't play with your mother.
Ask Yoyotte.
She was there.
So Yoyotte can talk now?
Yoyotte can talk if she wants to.
Play with Yoyotte then!
And with your mother too!
They say you can't talk. and that I didn't play with mommy.
When Mathias dies, he'll stay in the box forever!
He'll get eaten up!
You better clean the room. or she'll be angry, and so will I!
If you don't,
I'll throw you on the floor!
There!
Don't cry, I'll make you better.
Don't be scared.
It's over now.
Mommy was all broken.
Last night she wasn't.
She was fine.
You're the same.
You won't come and play?
You're mean!
You never want to!
I'll only play with Yoyotte.
She's very sick.
Mommy didn't come last night.
What do you mean?
She comes to see me at night.
She comes into your dreams.
No, she comes down at night.
But not last night.
Maybe she can't come every night.
She needs to sleep too.
Will she sleep tonight?
I don't know.
If you want her to come, then I'm sure you will see her.
I want her to come every day.
You know what?
I'm going to tell you a story.
A true one.
When Jesus died, they buried his body and put a heavy tombstone on his grave.
So he couldn't get out?
We still do it, so the dead rest in peace.
But when people came to see him in the cemetery, the tombstone had moved and Jesus wasn't there anymore.
They saw two men wearing beautiful, gleaming clothes.
Who were they?
Princes?
No, they were angels.
The angels said Jesus was alive.
He wasn't dead anymore.
Jesus went to see his friends that day.
They were scared.
They thought he was a ghost.
Delphine said dead people become spirits.
He wasn't a spirit.
Jesus came back to life.
He was resurrected.
- He got back to normal?
- Yes.
Now he's alive, in Heaven.
And mommy?
Will she come back to life too?
She's with Jesus. One day, everyone will be resurrected.
Everyone will be together: mommy, daddy, you...
When will that happen?
It will happen when God wants it to happen.
Why?
Why is mommy in Heaven and not you?
I hope I'll be there one day too.
Why wouldn't you be?
I will be. I intend to.
Mommy didn't want to.
She wanted to stay with me.
She'll be back tonight.
I better hurry back to bed.
What are you doing?
I can't tell you.
Don't tell me. I don't care!
Can I stay with you?
Mommy didn't come last night.
What do you want to play?
I don't want to play.
I'm waiting for my mother.
Dead people never come back.
Jesus did it for his friends.
I'm more than a friend.
I'm mommy's daughter.
Grandpa never came back.
Because no one was waiting for him.
You're not playing?
I can't find Delphine.
Ponette's waiting for her mom.
It's just a game.
No, she's really waiting.
Ponette!
Won't you play with Mathias?
I can't.
What are you doing?
I can't tell you.
Ponette's playing at waiting for her mom.
What game is this?
Baby, I recognize your little legs!
I'm dead again.
If someone says the magic word,
I'll come back to life.
What's the magic word?
It's Jesus's magic word.
Is it a real magic word?
It's for resurrecting his friends.
If you don't believe me, ask my mom.
What's the magic word?
It has to be whispered, or else something bad can happen.
Ta
Li
Ta Koom!
Ta Li Ta Koom!
Now that everyone's gone, you can come.
You can do it for me.
Won't you come to eat?
I don't want to.
You have to eat a little.
Daddy would want that.
I'm not hungry.
What are you waiting for?
Nothing.
I'm just looking around.
Will you wait for long?
I don't know.
I thought I believed in God like a child, but you found him right away.
It's as if your mommy took you to heaven and you came back with your heart full of God's love.
Even if you scare me a little, you're a wonderful girl.
Ponette!
I'm sorry.
What does "sorry" mean?
It means you shouldn't wait.
She won't come.
Yes she will.
Jesus came back, but when other people die, they don't really come back.
But I can really fly!
She hears you, sees you, and she still loves you.
But she can't come back.
I'm sure of it.
You know, flying mice can fly upside down and right-side up too.
They go like this to turn around and then... and like this with their wings.
I can fly really far.
Show me how you fly.
You can't see flying mice.
They fly too fast.
But I can see them.
I don't know how to tell you.
Flying mice...
No, that's enough.
No more flying mice.
Maybe one day
I'll be able to teach others to fly.
She won't come back, Ponette.
Let's go inside now.
I don't want to.
It's my turn to decide tonight.
It's Jesus who decides what I do.
I take care of you.
Jesus is relying on me to do that.
Let's go.
Tomorrow my mommy and I are leaving and we're never coming back.
She didn't come because you all ganged up on her, not me.
They don't want her to come back.
I do. I love your mommy.
You never told her.
I can't tell her.
You can too.
She can hear you.
How do I do it?
You pray. You close your eyes.
I don't believe in that!
You pray.
You close your eyes.
Put my hands right.
Like this?
Close...
No, wait.
Do like this.
Like this?
No, one half.
Not the other.
Like this.
No, straight, like this.
Like this.
No, like this.
- How?
- Like this.
I love you.
I'm not sure you can hear me, but I'm looking after Ponette for you. That's all.
Good. Now I'll tell you where mommy and I hide.
It'll be our secret.
Okay.
We'll wait here.
Hello little bear.
I'll take you along.
Don't make any noise.
Because...
Jesus is in jail.
Why?
He was put in jail by evil witches.
They better not find us!
Hurry, let's hide!
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Is this your hiding place?
- Yes.
This is no hiding place.
Everyone can see you.
Anyway, mommy's still asleep.
We have to sing her a song to wake her up.
I don't know any songs.
This is dumb!
Dead people can't wake up.
You're bothering her.
She doesn't want to see you.
She won't come!
We can't stay here.
She doesn't like it here.
It's too close.
Mommy will be happy to see you.
But you have to be nice, or else she won't come.
If you're not nice, she won't come.
We have to find presents for her.
Are you coming?
Mommy!
Talita Koom!
Talita Koom! Talita Koom!
Talita Koom!
It took me two hours to drive here, plus another two tonight.
Why are you here all alone?
I have some presents.
Little presents.
Too bad they're not for me.
They're for mommy?
Yeah, but for you too.
How much longer will you wait for her?
Are you crazy or what?
No.
Yes you are.
It may be the influence of your cousins and Claire, but you're crazy.
God doesn't talk to the living.
God's for the dead, not us.
Your mommy wasn't scared to die, so spare her all this Jesus and God stuff.
Please.
Live in a world with me and your cousins. a world of the living.
Lying to yourself won't make the hurting stop.
You didn't have to yell at me.
I'll stop yelling if you stop acting crazy, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
Let's go to your room.
First door on the right.
This is the right?
Here we are, Ponette. tell her your name.
Luce.
She'll be staying here with Delphine?
And Luce too.
We're going to Mathias's room. Stay here.
Will you be my friend?
I have to ask Yoyotte.
Who's Yoyotte?
My doll. I think she'd like that.
Great! It'll be fun!
Like that!
Like that!
Very good! Very good!
Guillame is just like last year.
He won't let the boys look at Carla.
I like it when boys look at me.
Are you jealous?
The other boys are chicken.
He scares them.
He's really ugly, that boyfriend of yours.
But he's really strong.
And really ugly.
If everyone does like him, no one will look at anyone.
He doesn't want me to have another boyfriend.
I have a boyfriend at home and another one here.
Who is it?
My cousin.
I'm like my mom. I prefer singles.
What are singles?
They're people who are all alone except for their kids, if they have kids.
No boyfriends?
"Singles", that means... sometimes it means you have a boyfriend, but you're not married. sometimes, but it's rare.
Are there ever... guys who come see your mom?
Yeah.
Friends or boyfriends?
No, they're not boyfriends!
So that means...
Your mom likes singles.
So there's a guy...
Each time there's a guy who comes to her house, right?
So afterwards... they're not singles if there are two of them.
No, they don't stay at the house.
But they're together!
They just come to make her feel better.
What happened to your mom?
Daddy and her are separated.
Really?
Why doesn't Ponette talk?
When she thinks about what happened, she gets sad.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'll take you.
I'm taking her to the bathroom.
Delphine, it's bedtime!
Ponette has to go.
She doesn't feel well.
Are you sick?
She's too sad to answer.
I'll take care of Ponette.
Okay.
You shouldn't be too sad.
Yes I should.
Your mommy was sad too.
She cried on her way to heaven.
God cried as he waited for her.
When God was Jesus on earth, he also cried.
But usually he's as joyful as a child.
It's not joyful being a child.
When we need God, he makes a sign.
What kind of sign?
He touches you and you feel better.
He didn't touch me.
You weren't paying attention.
I was too!
But I don't know what he looks like.
Like nothing. He's a spirit.
Jesus isn't a spirit.
When he went up to heaven he became one.
Come on.
Daddy said that it's not true.
And that it won't stop me from hurting.
It's not nice to lie to me!
You feel better?
Yeah, but I don't like the girl out there.
She's nice. You'll see.
Goodnight.
Goodnight to Yoyotte too.
Goodnight.
And goodnight to my daddy too.
- Your tummy hurts?
- Yes.
I have some tummy medicine.
It's really yummy.
A tiny teaspoon.
I'll be right back.
Mathias can stay.
Was it good?
Yes. I love syrup.
Me too. It's my favourite.
But I hate suppositories.
I've had enough.
I never want any more.
Well, I love suppositories!
What? You love suppositories?
Yes. And you know what I like the most?
No.
When they rub cream on you, they touch you and you feel better.
- Should I pretend to?
- Okay, do it here.
I'll take off your T-shirt.
I'll take my little tube.
On your nose.
Up to your nose.
There, all finished!
Feel better now?
Yes, a little better.
I feel a lot better.
You know,
I'm in Arthur's gang.
We'll be raiding the girls.
Aurelie is really nice.
Tickle, tickle.
Stop it.
Tickle tickle.
Let me go, Ponette...
A goodbye kiss.
That's God's room.
It's where you go to pray.
Can we go in?
Not alone.
We can't make noise in there.
You have to ask a teacher or Aurelie.
Why does God have a room?
Just because. If you don't believe me, ask Aurelie.
Or ask Ada, the girl over there.
I won't ask her anything.
You never want to, but you keep asking me questions about your mother.
Just ask Ada.
She knows tons about God.
And she's a Jew.
She knows everything about Jesus.
Why do Jews know everything about Jesus?
Because Jesus was a Jew.
Just like Ada.
I don't think so.
I'm sure of it.
You never heard of Jews and you say it's not true.
I'll explain.
There's a Jewish religion and a Catholic one.
Catholics are allowed to eat pork.
Jews aren't allowed to.
But Ada eats pork anyway.
- You know what pork is?
- Yes.
What's the difference between Jews and Catholics?
Some Catholics aren't nice.
But there' aren't too many mean Catholics.
There are nice Jews too.
Some Catholics speak Arabic.
Because Arabs aren't Jews.
Arabs live across the sea and they're Catholics.
Are you sure?
Yeah, they're half-Jewish, half-Catholic.
I doubt it.
There are Arabs who are totally Jewish, but not a lot.
I don't get it at all!
You didn't listen. That's why.
If you want, you can ask Ada.
She's nice.
She'll explain things.
You know what she is?
She's a child of God.
A child of God?
Yeah, she's the only one.
There are no others here.
- Are you really a child of God?
- Sure I am.
What's a child of God?
It's like God is our daddy.
But don't you already have a daddy?
This way, I can ask God things too.
God has powers. He's almighty.
He can give orders because he's the strongest.
You know,
Jesus is not almighty.
He can't order God around.
But if you're a child of God, you have power over God.
Some people can order God around a little.
My daddy doesn't believe in God.
I do.
I can even make him stop talking. because sometimes he talks too much.
I do something and he loses his voice.
What do you do?
My powers are my secrets.
What's his voice like?
It's deep.
I can hear it everywhere.
Below, above, right, left, every which way.
God said
I had to undergo great trials.
"You have to undergo great trials."
- To become a child of God?
- Yes.
And I did them all.
I can make you do them too.
But if your daddy doesn't believe in God, it may not work.
What if I believe?
I don't know.
I'll think over and ask him.
What I really want, is to make God let me talk to my mother.
Can't you just talk to her?
No, my mommy's dead.
No one can talk to a dead person.
You can't talk to her directly.
You have to ask God.
God decides.
But you can if you're a child of God!
You do it in God's room?
What's God's room?
The room where my people pray.
Oh, the chapel.
You can talk to him there too.
Your mother wouldn't hear you.
Only God.
I'll see what to do if your dad doesn't believe and your mom's dead.
You want me to give you a trial tomorrow?
Okay.
- Did I hurt you?
- Yes.
Aurelie, can you show me God's room?
Okay, but not for long.
I have work to do.
We pray here.
We can think about God and Jesus.
I know mommy's in heaven.
She's with God.
Yes, she lives with God.
Yes.
Before, mommy couldn't hear me.
She can hear your prayers.
But she couldn't answer because it's God who decides.
God's the boss. He decides.
That's right.
You know what lava is?
It's the devil.
If you fall in the lava, you burn and die!
There are little islands.
You have to jump onto an island.
You need to wear glasses.
I can stay with you in the lava because I already passed this trial.
- My feet can't burn.
- Yes.
- Ready?
- Yes.
I'll help you.
If you fall in the lava, you'll die!
And your glasses will burn!
They'll melt!
Hurry up!
You win! But... the second jump is the hardest.
Come on!
You messed up.
Good thing I'm here.
Can you smell your shoes?
- Can't you smell them?
- No.
You can't smell the burnt rubber?
Yes I can.
And now you have to jump from the island back to earth.
Come on, lazybones!
You're not a child of God yet.
But anyway, you passed the first trial.
It was a little hard.
But soon you'll have magic powers.
God Almighty...
God Almighty... you know my mommy is dead because she's with you.
But I want to talk to my mommy.
I tried and I couldn't.
She never answered me.
Tell her to talk to me.
See, mommy?
I talked to God Almighty.
I have lots of kisses for you.
Can you kiss the candy?
Go on, go on.
We'll play a trick on Mathias.
Come on.
You'll see. It'll be funny.
For the others too.
You're single.
You want some candy?
What flavour?
Bite it and see.
What does single mean?
If you bite it...
You'll see, like I said.
Why are you laughing?
You're in love with Carla!
She played the magic candy trick on you!
She kissed the candy before.
Now you have to love Carla.
You have to ask her to marry you!
What if I don't want to?
With magic candy, you have to want to!
You have to ask her to get married.
You're like daddies.
You don't like love.
My daddy likes love.
My daddy loves love.
Mathias loves Carla!
Mathias loves Carla!
Give her a kiss!
A kiss! A kiss!
Leave me alone!
"Caroline's little dog..."
Yes, Ponette?
My head hurts.
Can I go to sleep in my room?
Delphine, take her to her room.
We'll ask Aurelie for medicine.
You'll see. You'll feel better.
Go to sleep now.
God Almighty...
God Almighty,
I hope you told mommy that I prayed.
It was a prayer for you and for her too.
I'm okay. I'll wait on my bed.
That way, it'll be a secret.
No one will see.
This is my second prayer and I'm very happy.
Thank you, God.
If God is almighty, why won't he make a sign?
He won't talk to me.
My prayers didn't do anything.
Not for mommy, not for nothing.
You just started.
Why do you want signs?
Aurelie told me too.
Maybe your mommy's angry.
At me?
I don't know.
Ask Aurelie or Ada.
They know.
I was never dead.
I don't know what happens in heaven.
Mom is picking us up tonight.
Pack your things.
Don't forget anything.
Watch closely.
This is what you have to do.
- You're scared!
- No.
You'll never be a child of God.
- I don't care.
- No, you're just scared.
No, God is against me.
Why would he be?
He's upset.
Yeah, upset.
He's angry.
- At who?
- At me.
All he told me was:
"Ponette has trials to undergo".
That's all.
He didn't say anything to me.
See, I wasn't scared!
That makes two trials.
I'm stopping. I'll start again when God talks to me.
He won't unless you're a child of God.
What if I pass all the tests?
Then he'll talk to you too.
You have to get ahead.
If you work on it this week-end it'll go faster.
What should I do?
Prove that you're brave.
It's a really hard one.
It's scary, especially if you hear noises.
It's just for five minutes.
Chickening out?
I don't know if this counts for being a child of God.
If it's scary, it does.
And this is scary.
And it stinks!
It forces you to be brave, so it counts.
Give me the watch.
You'll stay nearby?
We can't tell you that.
Come on.
Five minutes.
I'll help you in.
Here, give me the watch.
I’ll close it: one, two, three!
Move your hand.
Look.
Five minutes.
When the little hand is on 5.
You're already really brave.
If you tell yourself a Batman story, it'll go faster.
Starting now.
- Should we go or stay?
- Let's go!
No, we should stay.
She's crying!
Hurry up!
You did it!
Five minutes!
Great, Ponette! You did it!
Great!
I'll help her out. and then you help me out.
Sure I will.
You'll help me out?
You did it!
You did it, Ponette!
Get in there!
On my shoulders.
Climb up, Ponette.
Help me out now.
Okay.
Get in there!
Watch your hands.
Careful.
Let's go.
Careful.
Come back!
Who wants to kill me?
We always have to kill you!
Then you hit me. Forget it!
Go rot in jail!
You can kill me.
I don't want to.
I'll lend you my gun if you do.
I'll shoot you in the head.
Yeah! And I’ll scream while I die!
You can't kill anyone else!
Why not?
It's my gun. Give it back.
Give it back.
Give it back! It's mine!
You killed your mom because you were mean.
Don't try killing anyone else.
You already killed your mother!
When someone's mommy dies... it's because her kid was mean.
Get it?
That's not true!
I'm not mean!
You're the mean one!
No, I'm always nice and my mom's not dead!
Get it?
You're mean!
It serves you right she's dead!
If my mommy was here, you'd never have said that.
If my mommy was here...
You're mean!
What's wrong?
I want to die.
Why?
Because I want to.
Is it Antoine?
No, it's me.
What did Antoine say?
He said I was really mean... and it serves me right if my mommy died.
That's dumb.
You're nice. I'm nice too.
When you're nice, you give presents.
You can have my Batman if you want it.
Thanks.
Put it in your pocket so you don't lose it.
If you're nice, you should give me something.
What will it be?
My daddy's watch.
Okay.
- Give it back when I want.
- Okay.
Go back to sleep now.
I want to disappear forever.
To go where?
To see my mommy.
Your mommy may be in heaven.
That's why...
That's why you have to make me die.
But your father's coming on Friday.
Is it Antoine you want to kill?
Yes.
Then you'll stop thinking bout dying?
I want to die.
Either we kill him and you don't die... or we don't kill Antoine and we kill you.
But I don't know how to kill him.
We can buy a real-life gun.
But if we kill him,
Aurelie will yell at us.
No she won't.
From now on, stick by me during recess.
You're nutty but nice.
I don't want you deciding to die.
Give me a kiss.
Go back to bed now.
You still want your mom to come back?
If you're having a hard time, I have an idea.
- You know Mathias's Smarties?
- Yes.
- Mathias really loves Carla now.
- That's true.
Keep quiet about Carla!
If you go to the cemetery, take some Smarties.
But I'm almost a child of God.
But you need to fix her voice.
- She'll have no voice?
- She hasn't spoken for a while.
I have to fix it?
Resurrect her with magic Smarties then have her eat them.
I gave you five.
What's the blue one for?
So you don't fall in water.
Green resurrects.
And red?
Take your seats!
Come on, you chatterboxes.
The orange one is... if you want to take a walk, your mommy will too.
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for daddy.
Henri said to come!
I'm waiting for daddy.
Parents come on Fridays, after school.
That's tomorrow.
Don't stand there. Come with me.
Delphine?
What is it?
My mommy, she came for real in my dream.
And?
And she came.
She smelled me and I smelled her.
What did she smell like?
She smelled good.
Like candy.
I can still smell her.
Can you?
No.
And you know what else?
She held me in her arms.
I don't smell anything.
She went away again.
Mommy!
I'm here.
So I smell like candy?
My nutty little girl.
Mathias is right.
You're nutty but nice.
I came so you'd stop worrying.
I came in flesh and blood so I wouldn't scare you, but it's really me.
I looked for you with God.
I know.
When I felt I was dying,
I could have resisted, but it was easier not to.
I didn't fight. I let go.
I know it wasn't nice for you.
I didn't think of you.
I was mean and selfish.
I did all the trials with Ada.
I said goodbye.
I wasn't bad. It took time.
When I reached the end, before I went under,
I heard a voice.
It was you calling me.
All the time...
I called out to you but to tell you it wasn't worth it.
I called you then I don't know what happened.
Last night you held me.
I'm sure of it.
You held me too.
Happy spirits like your mommy never die.
Let's go.
A yellow flower!
What pretty flowers!
I picked it because your tomb wasn't pretty.
Where was it?
Over there.
On Ulysses's tomb.
Who remembers Ulysses?
- Shall we go?
- Okay.
Isn't it spooky here?
Everyone's forgotten Ulysses.
Fortunately, memories still remember him.
It's a memory.
Someone we probably never knew.
A girl's whistling and her daddy's saying: "That's not nice!"
It is nice!
Maybe it was a long time ago when only boys whistled.
Maybe it's Ulysses's daughter's memory.
Her name is Clorinde.
Bye, Clorinde! See you later.
Bye, Ulysses.
Tomorrow daddy will take you out and you'll laugh all day long!
You played with them twice at night.
With who?
With Mathias and Delphine.
You didn't play with me or look at me.
Never again. I'll play with you.
We'll play tonight, if you want.
For real?
For real in your dreams.
That's not for real.
When we play it's always for real.
Catch me a memory.
I don't want to.
I hate children who never want to.
I hate children who complain.
Why are you alive?
To want everything.
That's why I came back, so you'd make me a promise.
Stop crying, stop complaining.
I don't want a sad child.
- Does life scare you?
- No.
No, life's not too much for my girl.
No one likes neglectful children.
What's a neglectful child?
- One who forgets to laugh?
- That's right!
A child who forgets to laugh.
You can die, but die alive, full of life!
Until then, the world is yours.
Try everything.
Every single thing.
Then you can die.
I have to try everything!
Everything!
Can you not care?
No, you can't.
No, you have to care about life.
- Mommy?
- Yes?
I'm cold.
That's why I brought a sweater.
You want it?
When I saw you leave, I thought:
"She's going to be cold".
What did you find?
What did you find?
- I won't show you.
- Yes you will.
What is it?
A baby.
- A baby's memory?
- One who's not born yet.
- It's in its mommy's belly?
- Yes.
- Do you know this baby?
- Yes.
Do I know it too?
- Do I know it?
- Yes!
What's it doing?
It's jiggling around.
I know. It's night time.
Mommy's asleep and daddy's playing with the baby.
He's stroking it in mommy's belly.
The baby answers him by thrashing about.
- With its feet?
- And fists.
And the baby can hear daddy talking.
And when I wake up,
I see you both playing.
Yes, we play while you sleep.
So I fall back asleep because I like it when you play.
And the baby, it can talk too.
It says: "Don't tickle me!"
Ponette, whenever you want, jump up and catch a memory of me,
- Okay.
- You promise?
Will you stay with me?
No, I'm dead.
Not anymore.
I'm still a little dead.
If you stay, maybe they'll forget you're here.
But they'll know I'm here.
Not if the two of us hide well.
You can hide with me.
My head hit the steering wheel and everything broke.
My chest broke against it too.
You know that.
You have to go now.
Daddy came for you.
Go and be happy with him.
I'm not sad when you're happy with him.
We're going to Lyon, to the fair.
Go then.
Don't forget I love you.
Don't forget.
Goodbye, Ponette.
You have to go now.
Go.
No.
Turn around.
Do you love me for real?
Oh yes, I love you.
Go now.
- Have some candy.
- No.
Go see daddy.
Ponette!
Where were you?
With my mommy.
I saw her all day long.
You went to the cemetery alone?
Are you crazy?
How was it?
It was nice.
She came back in flesh and blood.
I wasn't even scared.
She gave me her red sweater.
I haven't seen it in a while.
She was right to.
Yeah, but... the thing is she'll never come back.
She told me so.
She can't keep making round trips.
No.
But there are holes in the ground and you can come back.
She told me to learn to be happy.
She told me to learn to be happy.
